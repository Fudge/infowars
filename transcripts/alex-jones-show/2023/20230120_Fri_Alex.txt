[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:16.892]  There's a lot of discussion about what the new world order will be or how, even in the context of our new Helsinki, how do we work towards that new normative international order that allows us to address our differences and disputes as the civilized world.
[00:00:17.853 --> 00:00:28.935]  And I believe perhaps we are at the moment in such a hyper-partisan, hyper-polarized time that we're not going to be able to form that new Helsinki.
[00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:42.141]  Today but I hope going forward we are able to do I mean we must we must form and improve our normative and international institutional order internationally so that we can address these complaints.
[00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:51.865]  I hope this time around once we're building this new world order or new rules-based order the voice of the global South and the developing world is included.
[00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.775]  That they control, they own, that they're using as a weapon while they cut their resources off and then offer them to flood us.
[00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:01.878]  I mean, this is just their own admitted diabolical plan.
[00:01:06.722 --> 00:01:11.526]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.947]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:33.039]  In 2003, the CIA released a classified document with the subject heading, Analysis and Assessment of Gateway Process, a process that utilizes audio frequencies to achieve brain hemisphere synchronization.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:43.466]  In order to provide a thorough evaluation, the document covers the techniques of hypnosis, biofeedback, and transcendental meditation.
[00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:52.029]  Thereby providing a modern scientific account of an ancient guarded knowledge of mankind's spiritual potential.
[00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:59.671]  A potential that could save humanity from the mind control tactics being used to divide and enslave us.
[00:02:00.551 --> 00:02:05.594]  The left brain is the mind's verbal and linear reasoning component.
[00:02:06.214 --> 00:02:20.262]  It categorizes and assigns meaning to incoming stimuli and passes this resulting information to the right brain, which is non-critical and accepts whatever information it is given without question.
[00:02:21.022 --> 00:02:23.164]  The left brain is the ego mind.
[00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:28.548]  It operates on autopilot and can be easily swayed by external stimuli.
[00:02:29.088 --> 00:02:35.814]  Most of us are unaware of this because we naturally tend to identify ourselves with the ego.
[00:02:36.174 --> 00:02:38.656]  We think that the ego is who we are.
[00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:42.620]  But in fact, it is just a part of our mental processing.
[00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:58.217]  The right brain is our subconscious mind, and hypnosis is a technique of directly accessing the subconscious by disengaging the ego, giving us self-awareness and control over the subconscious mind.
[00:02:59.197 --> 00:03:09.604]  Transcendental meditation achieves this by practicing single-minded concentration of drawing energy up from the base of the spinal cord and into the brain.
[00:03:10.185 --> 00:03:22.933]  With practice, this visual concentration eventually polarizes the cortex, bringing both hemispheres into balance, allowing the individual to transcend the ego mind.
[00:03:24.034 --> 00:03:47.926]  With biofeedback, rather than suppressing the left brain as done with hypnosis or ignoring it as done with meditation, the practitioner programs the ego mind with visualization while monitoring the physiological response, thereby programming the subconscious mind by observing the results with real-time biological feedback.
[00:03:49.046 --> 00:04:02.977]  The Gateway Process, also known as Hemisync, achieves this same goal by simply listening to specific audio frequencies that bring both hemispheres of the brain into synchronicity with one another.
[00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:11.956]  All of these practices, some of which have been taught for millennia, have been proven effective with modern scientific tools.
[00:04:12.617 --> 00:04:27.527]  The gateway process has been shown to bring the entire body into a coherent vibration of approximately 7 to 7.5 cycles per second, which then creates a resonance with the electrostatic field of the Earth.
[00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:40.315]  It is believed that this resonance is what allows the practitioner to transcend time and space, or in other words, allow their consciousness to leave the body without limitation.
[00:04:41.204 --> 00:04:44.967]  What we call physical matter is not solid at all.
[00:04:45.447 --> 00:04:51.111]  It is more like a highly advanced holographic image made up of different frequencies.
[00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:58.336]  What we experience as solid matter is actually the electromagnetic repulsion of certain frequencies.
[00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:01.779]  And this includes our own physical body.
[00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:15.592]  And so it is believed that the reason these practices work is because our consciousness is not being generated by our bodies, but rather our bodies are being generated by our consciousness.
[00:05:16.473 --> 00:05:24.742]  Physicists have proven that the physical world is energy and define time as a measurement of change within this energy.
[00:05:25.562 --> 00:05:31.244]  In order for energy to take form, it needs to be limited to a specific vibration.
[00:05:31.944 --> 00:05:35.845]  Energy at rest is uniformly extended, without limit.
[00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:37.785]  It is everywhere at once.
[00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:53.670]  This is why humans are able to remote view, which is a term used by the military for their psychic training protocol, wherein they teach an individual to transcend space and time in order to gather information remotely.
[00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:00.091]  And this is how Mr. Guy Cervelli was able to drop a goat from a hundred feet away with his thoughts.
[00:06:00.892 --> 00:06:13.935]  But most importantly, the suppression of this knowledge is how the government is able to program your subconscious mind for you, without you even knowing it, and control what you perceive to be reality.
[00:06:15.882 --> 00:06:49.987]   About a week ago, before the World Economic Forum, the mouthpiece of the New World Order, met in Davos, Switzerland, in their own publications they began to communicate to their minions that they're in deep trouble, that their minions are in deep trouble, and that a global awakening is accelerating at a rapid pace, and at the heart of that is the worldwide understanding that the enemies of humanity that control the UN created the deadly virus, released the virus, and gave us even more deadly shots And now it's cascading all over the world, criminal investigations and mainline news.
[00:06:50.527 --> 00:07:02.473]  CNN reported yesterday, I have the clip, I have the article, that you are more likely to be hospitalized, catch COVID, be hospitalized, get seriously sick or die, if you had the booster shot.
[00:07:02.653 --> 00:07:06.374]  Now, we already knew that years ago, but that's CNN reporting that.
[00:07:06.675 --> 00:07:08.515]  I have the video and I have the article.
[00:07:08.575 --> 00:07:09.396]  I'm going to show it to you.
[00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:11.757]  That's just one in the stack.
[00:07:13.017 --> 00:07:13.878]  I'm getting chills right now.
[00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:25.330]  Similar all over the world is coming out because they know the information can't be stopped so they're going ahead and just beginning to slide it out there hoping you don't get too angry.
[00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.911]  Incredible.
[00:07:26.552 --> 00:07:47.864]   The Deimos Group All week long has been calling at the WEF event for censoring people in America and passing hate speech laws that don't let you criticize open borders, replacement migration, lockdowns, forced injections, pedophile training, LBGTQP garbage, election fraud.
[00:07:48.244 --> 00:07:55.486]  I mean, there's a list of over 60 things that they put out a few months ago that they're now reverberating here at the UN, at the Davos Group.
[00:07:55.506 --> 00:07:56.886]  The two things merged three months ago.
[00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:02.566]  listing jail time for questioning climate change.
[00:08:02.566 --> 00:08:05.846]   And guess what? Legislation's been introduced by the Democrats in the new Congress.
[00:08:05.846 --> 00:08:09.646]  We covered this two years ago, two days ago.
[00:08:09.646 --> 00:08:12.446]  We told you it was coming two years ago, 20 years ago.
[00:08:12.446 --> 00:08:20.406]   And they say in the legislation, if you talk bad about anyone of color,
[00:08:20.406 --> 00:08:22.046]  five years in prison, federal crime.
[00:08:22.154 --> 00:08:24.116]  It actually says that in the bill.
[00:08:24.236 --> 00:08:27.378]  If you deny climate change, prison time.
[00:08:27.918 --> 00:08:41.808]  And we play you the clips here where the deputy head of the EU on elected bureaucracy says, looking towards the Republican congressman sitting next to her, that we know soon you will be passing the law to outlaw any hate speech in America.
[00:08:41.848 --> 00:08:47.032]  And the Republican, former member of the J6 committee, nods his head.
[00:08:49.016 --> 00:09:01.242]  So that's where they're going and now we have these new clips where they've absolutely hit the panic button and said the New World Order is failing and we're not going to get our global government quite yet.
[00:09:01.303 --> 00:09:09.307]  We're behind schedule because people aren't accepting the global digital currency, the carbon taxes.
[00:09:10.888 --> 00:09:27.311]   All the mechanisms they've got and they blame the nationalism and they blame the populism and Al Gore responds, we'll play that clip as well, that if you think a few million or ten million illegals come into your country, Has triggered a, quote, xenophobic response.
[00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:28.952]  Well, imagine a billion.
[00:09:29.312 --> 00:09:30.673]  But this is replacement migration.
[00:09:31.053 --> 00:09:38.596]  He says global warming has caused this giant surge of illegals into Europe and giant surge into the United States and other Western worlds.
[00:09:38.656 --> 00:09:43.238]  But they've had two plus years of lockdown in the third world, longer than anywhere else under IMF world bank control.
[00:09:43.999 --> 00:09:49.681]  Ninety plus percent of the refugees coming here, who I don't blame, they've had their food and industry and farming cut off.
[00:09:50.282 --> 00:09:52.743]  They're still being used as a weapon, though, flooding us.
[00:09:55.004 --> 00:09:59.269]  90 plus percent say they're coming here because there's no jobs and no farming and they've been locked down.
[00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:03.034]  They locked down Latin America and Africa for two years.
[00:10:03.955 --> 00:10:06.137]  They locked down areas of the Middle East for a year and a half.
[00:10:07.495 --> 00:10:35.194]  Areas of Asia, over two years, and then the UN sets up refugee centers and gives them $2,000, €2,000 debit cards with no name on them, and allows them into the Western world, and the UN controls the refugee bureaus through the UN Refugee Treaty and Migrant Treaty that Trump pulled us out of, that Biden put us back into, and so the UN NGOs under treaty are in control of the border response and the border patrols of the world.
[00:10:35.894 --> 00:10:39.715]  And finally, Governor Abbott three weeks ago launched a criminal investigation of it.
[00:10:39.755 --> 00:10:39.955]  Yeah.
[00:10:40.275 --> 00:10:50.677]  How the hell is the NGO head, the former head of the NGO operation of the European invasion by the Middle East and Africa, how is he in charge?
[00:10:51.037 --> 00:10:51.997]  Go to the Texas border.
[00:10:52.017 --> 00:10:52.737]  Go to the Arizona border.
[00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:53.457]  We shot video of it.
[00:10:53.857 --> 00:11:00.078]  Giant facilities that hold 20, 30,000 people apiece, where they just process them and then send them into the interior of the U.S.
[00:11:00.418 --> 00:11:04.279]  And it's run by blue and green haired NGO communists.
[00:11:06.411 --> 00:11:08.872]  They tell the Border Patrol what to do!
[00:11:11.293 --> 00:11:13.233]  And so again, I'm going off on a rant about that.
[00:11:13.333 --> 00:11:39.100]   It's just that, here's Al Gore, we'll get to the clip next segment, saying, oh, if you don't cut off the carbon, and if you don't shut down society, and if you don't follow our green initiative to cut off farming, around the world and food, you're going to flood us with illegals when they're the very ones that created the economic climate and then organized the invasion.
[00:11:41.382 --> 00:11:42.503]  Now here's drone footage.
[00:11:42.583 --> 00:11:43.524]  We got drone footage.
[00:11:43.564 --> 00:11:44.686]  We got helicopter footage.
[00:11:45.927 --> 00:11:48.489]  I think this is our footage, but it all it all bleeds together.
[00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.352]  But that's what's going on.
[00:11:51.372 --> 00:11:55.636]   Remember if you're a radio listener, You're going to hear me describing something.
[00:11:55.917 --> 00:11:59.377]  That's because we're also simulcast, of course, in fullwords.com forward slash show.
[00:11:59.417 --> 00:12:00.978]  We're a radio show on TV.
[00:12:01.818 --> 00:12:04.199]  We were the first to do it, really the second to do it, after Don Imus.
[00:12:05.119 --> 00:12:12.361]  Now, of course, everybody does it, but a lot of times TV viewers are like, why are you narrating a closed captioning, say, on French or German?
[00:12:12.781 --> 00:12:14.822]  Well, because the radio listeners can't read that.
[00:12:14.942 --> 00:12:17.903]  So I'm just explaining to TV viewers why we do things that are different.
[00:12:18.283 --> 00:12:25.009]   The radio listeners, because we've got two different big audiences here that we are Fully, fully aware of.
[00:12:25.029 --> 00:12:35.012]  And we've got our Southern Border Crisis Archive that's being updated every day at Bandot Video that is a treasure trove of documenting the human smuggling and the whole UN operation and more.
[00:12:35.912 --> 00:12:42.154]  So when we come back, Debo's attendees agenda is to create a new world order.
[00:12:43.494 --> 00:12:45.075]  We're gonna play the clip.
[00:12:47.135 --> 00:12:48.575]  But that's not really the takeaway.
[00:12:48.775 --> 00:12:50.516]  Of course it's to create a world government new world order.
[00:12:52.537 --> 00:12:58.162]  The takeaway is they say they're losing, which they are losing.
[00:12:58.182 --> 00:13:00.224]  All right, we're going to go to break here in about two and a half minutes.

[00:13:06.149 --> 00:13:07.911]  We're very close to defeating the enemy.

[00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:18.620]  People's minds, their intellects are very fertile ground for the truth now, because the enemy's not in beta, they're in operational.
[00:13:19.401 --> 00:13:30.554]  But we need funds to stay on air and pay for our huge bandwidth bills, our legal bills, to pay for the crew, our reporters, everything we're doing here that is absolutely critical to the future of liberty and freedom.

[00:15:41.976 --> 00:15:55.980]  By the way, there's a lot of huge news to cover domestically and we're going to be getting to it all today because we have huge guest in studio, Dr. Andrew Huff, the mega number one whistleblower of the entire COVID situation.
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:02.152]   And as usual, the most important person in the whole Operation coming down.
[00:16:02.172 --> 00:16:10.340]  I mean, if you got to choose one person who's the total insider that leaked everything to the media two plus years ago, he's the one.
[00:16:11.761 --> 00:16:17.165]  And whenever all these lawyers and people I know said, we got big whistleblowers, he's getting his touch from more whistleblowers, they wouldn't tell me his name.
[00:16:17.706 --> 00:16:19.947]  And then now in the last six, eight months, that's all come out.
[00:16:20.808 --> 00:16:24.591]  And he was the vice president of EcoHealth Alliance, and he saw what they were doing.
[00:16:25.251 --> 00:16:32.837]  And he saw that it was an intelligence operation, because he worked obviously in the government, the military and intelligence, and had the top secret security clearances.
[00:16:32.897 --> 00:16:34.778]  So this is a big deal.
[00:16:34.798 --> 00:16:36.160]  He's in studio next hour.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:50.915]  And if a forest falls in the forest falls the tree falls in the forest but nobody's here to hear it make a sound doesn't make a sound this is a big sound folks this is a big event a big signal and we need to be aware of it and dealing with it.
[00:16:52.506 --> 00:16:56.971]  Because the enemy is signaling they're going to release more bioweapons very, very soon.
[00:16:57.812 --> 00:17:04.558]  Now, also in studio in the fourth hour, and I'll be hosting the fourth hour, Judge Andrew Napolitano to cover the waterfront.
[00:17:04.578 --> 00:17:06.580]  That's going to be a huge interview as well.
[00:17:06.621 --> 00:17:09.984]  So a big Friday broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:17:11.125 --> 00:17:16.347]   The news is so off the chain that I rarely have this happen.
[00:17:16.427 --> 00:17:17.828]  I'm having trouble doing the show right now.
[00:17:18.108 --> 00:17:31.292]  Okay, I'm like a dog in a butcher shop and there's all these cuts of meat hanging down and I'm just like salivating and confused and not even knowing what to do next because the cuts of meat to me are exposing evil and stopping them and I don't know how I do this justice.
[00:17:31.652 --> 00:17:35.733]  I mean this is just unbelievable what's coming out.
[00:17:36.054 --> 00:17:41.475]  The Democratic Party is now officially endorsing pedophilia and you've already seen it everywhere but now they're officially doing it.
[00:17:41.755 --> 00:17:42.336]  I've got that.
[00:17:43.136 --> 00:18:04.822]   I've got The head of the Orthodox Church worldwide saying that nuclear war is imminent and you've got just absolute insanity going on with major heavy weapons and class-a weapons being poured into Ukraine now and another 2.5 billion just this week they're about to inject in a taxpayer money into this
[00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:07.732]  Insane situation.
[00:18:08.593 --> 00:18:14.137]  We've got off the hook COVID news coming out that we'll get to next hour with Dr. Huff in studio.
[00:18:15.077 --> 00:18:22.543]  We have got this fight that we're hearing between Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro and normally that flies below the radar.
[00:18:23.784 --> 00:18:28.388]  That's not big enough for us to talk about, but it's a window into how the control works.
[00:18:29.329 --> 00:18:32.612]  And I'm on Steven Crowder's side in all this, because I know the inside baseball.
[00:18:33.093 --> 00:18:51.445]   That said, the Daily Wire has so many good people that are patriots at it, who I like, that I think just the signals goodness of the Liberty Movement is so powerful that even Ben Shapiro and Crenshaw and the
[00:18:51.445 --> 00:18:53.445]  rest of them cannot suppress it.
[00:18:53.445 --> 00:18:58.125]   So I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater, but if you really want to know
[00:18:58.125 --> 00:19:01.245]   what's going on there, I'm going to tell you a little bit later in the hour.
[00:19:01.245 --> 00:19:06.645]   And I can spend an hour on it, but I'm just going to spend a few minutes on it because
[00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:10.925]   Fox News has been used over the years to get all the conservatives and all the pundits
[00:19:10.925 --> 00:19:14.285]   in and control the narrative and make sure the patrons don't get hardcore.
[00:19:14.746 --> 00:19:20.147]  And only a few people like Judge Napolitano and Tucker Carlson have broken through that control.
[00:19:21.187 --> 00:19:26.608]  But Napolitano couldn't survive it because he was too dangerous to the deep state when he was exposing the illegal spying on Trump.
[00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:30.829]  Now they were using intelligence agencies to censor people and censor conservatives.
[00:19:31.229 --> 00:19:35.589]   He was the only person when I was having the same research and documents,
[00:19:35.589 --> 00:19:40.990]   and he had sources, I had sources as well and was experiencing it, that exposed
[00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.549]   it was intelligence agencies that were actually working against Trump and working against
[00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:45.509]  the American people.
[00:19:45.509 --> 00:19:49.549]   I mean, sure, Chuckie Schumer bragged about it when President Trump was President-elect
[00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:58.389]   early 2017, on what, January 7th, 2001, but the specifics were not known
[00:19:58.389 --> 00:20:01.829]   because most people didn't go read thousand-page defense bills like I did.
[00:20:01.829 --> 00:20:03.669]  It was all right there.
[00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:08.668]  So this is a big, big deal just on that front.
[00:20:08.668 --> 00:20:12.668]   So I guess in the few minutes left of this segment, I'll just go ahead and hit the Ben Shapiro thing
[00:20:12.668 --> 00:20:15.429]  'cause I've been ignoring it the last four or five days.
[00:20:14.968 --> 00:20:27.994]  I knew exactly what was going on, but I've had a chance to talk to the Crowder folks, and so I can give you the analysis, because I confirmed what I already knew was going on was going on, but I didn't want to go there until I checked if my analysis was correct.
[00:20:30.155 --> 00:20:32.916]  Crowder is as good as it gets, a real patriot American.
[00:20:34.032 --> 00:20:37.373]  And he loves the country, and he's a really smart, reasonable guy.
[00:20:37.913 --> 00:20:42.534]  He left The Blaze because he was like 80% of their money, and he was almost being paid nothing.
[00:20:44.334 --> 00:21:07.679]   Then when he went and interviewed with the people over at Ben Shapiro's operation, The Daily Wire, they sent him the contracts that said, we're gonna control everything you say, control whatever you do, and we'll withdraw your funds, and you're tied in for five years no matter what, if you get censored by big tech, essentially making big tech his boss. And then
[00:21:07.679 --> 00:21:11.939]   he just criticized them on air without saying their names. So some of them attacked him.
[00:21:11.939 --> 00:21:15.959]   So he released recordings of them basically admitting that. And his issue was he didn't
[00:21:15.959 --> 00:21:21.268]   take the deal because he's not going to be shackled, but he's really concerned about them
[00:21:21.268 --> 00:21:24.748]   controlling the conservative movement with all the other people that got locked in these
[00:21:24.748 --> 00:21:25.278]  contracts.
[00:21:25.463 --> 00:21:33.807]  Well, the lawyers and, you know, folks over there that are really smart, they made it all about Crowder not wanting $50 million when it was never about the money.
[00:21:34.047 --> 00:21:35.088]  And let me explain something.
[00:21:35.568 --> 00:21:37.129]  I know Crowder's bandwidth cost.
[00:21:37.169 --> 00:21:40.190]  I've had discussions with him and his crew quite a few times.
[00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.670]  We're friends.
[00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:41.511]  I go up there quite a bit.
[00:21:42.011 --> 00:21:42.692]  He comes down here.
[00:21:43.752 --> 00:21:44.893]  I know our bandwidth cost.
[00:21:44.973 --> 00:21:47.154]  It's $10 million over five years.
[00:21:48.843 --> 00:21:49.123]  Okay.
[00:21:49.724 --> 00:21:53.866]  $10 million or $50 million over five years.
[00:21:54.406 --> 00:21:58.028]  So that's only $10 million a year.
[00:21:59.189 --> 00:22:02.511]  Their bandwidth costs is in the millions of dollars a year.
[00:22:02.911 --> 00:22:11.016]  Their legal costs, their crew, all of that, I guarantee you under that deal, Steven Crowder will be paid about $500,000, $600,000 a year maybe.
[00:22:11.276 --> 00:22:13.097]  Because I know I pay the same type of bills.
[00:22:13.577 --> 00:22:14.518]  But that's not the issue.
[00:22:14.718 --> 00:22:16.219]  He never made it about the money.
[00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.572]  In fact, the money offers went up when he started to balk.
[00:22:19.612 --> 00:22:21.714]  He said, no, no, no, this is not about the money.
[00:22:22.134 --> 00:22:29.661]  It's about I'll be totally controlled by you arbitrarily if I go take this deal with you and bring all these people to you.
[00:22:30.181 --> 00:22:35.326]  When we know Crowder was making Glenn Beck conservatively $50 million a year.
[00:22:35.846 --> 00:22:42.993]  So, of course, the folks at Daily Wire say, oh, you're leaving Glenn Beck because you're only getting a few million dollars a year and can't even pay your bills.
[00:22:43.735 --> 00:22:44.695]  That's the truth about Crowder.
[00:22:44.955 --> 00:22:49.697]  Giant audience, should be making 50 million a year gross to be able to pay all the bills and all the rest of it.
[00:22:50.057 --> 00:22:58.501]  And I told Crowder, go to a direct sales model and leave all these people and then sell products so you make 50-60% on it and be free of them.
[00:22:58.561 --> 00:22:59.421]  Sell water filters.
[00:23:00.001 --> 00:23:00.721]  Sell vitamins.
[00:23:00.741 --> 00:23:01.222]  People want those.
[00:23:01.262 --> 00:23:02.362]  They don't want to buy it from Whole Foods.
[00:23:02.382 --> 00:23:03.622]  They don't want to buy it from Walgreens.
[00:23:03.642 --> 00:23:04.403]  They want to buy it from you.
[00:23:05.323 --> 00:23:07.544]  Sell gun accessories.
[00:23:08.004 --> 00:23:09.165]  Sell tactical gear.
[00:23:09.565 --> 00:23:10.605]  Sell storable food.
[00:23:10.945 --> 00:23:12.626]  I said, I will tell you how to do the whole deal.
[00:23:13.644 --> 00:23:15.224]  And Crowder's like, well, I don't like to market stuff.
[00:23:15.264 --> 00:23:16.225]  I don't like to go push stuff.
[00:23:16.245 --> 00:23:17.045]  I just want to do my show.
[00:23:17.265 --> 00:23:18.345]  He does a lot of preparation.
[00:23:18.365 --> 00:23:19.145]  That guy works hard.
[00:23:19.506 --> 00:23:21.486]  I'm like, okay, well, if you want your freedom, that's what you got to do.
[00:23:21.926 --> 00:23:33.909]  And you could be bigger than InfoWars ever was if you just go with the model of running your own operation, and then you could hire people and do what Daily Wire did, what I tried to do, but they came after us and attacked us and shut us down before we went to launch.
[00:23:34.169 --> 00:23:40.231]  I built all this to be 24 hours a day, have a bunch of hosts in here, and not control what they say as long as they're patriots.
[00:23:41.011 --> 00:23:43.073]  And we just never got to full launch here.
[00:23:43.333 --> 00:23:45.275]  You saw, the system saw what we were doing.
[00:23:45.575 --> 00:23:50.519]  They gave him unlimited financing, and they launched their thing to control the conservative movement, the Daily Wire.
[00:23:50.959 --> 00:23:54.642]  And so, it was not about money, and that is a deceptive thing they did.
[00:23:54.682 --> 00:24:05.250]  It was about the contract of him having no freedom, and they had total control over him, and they could exercise the contract where he couldn't work for five years, and they could pay the contract out as well.
[00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:07.192]  Those are called golden handcuffs.
[00:24:07.472 --> 00:24:08.433]  So I'm with Stephen Crowder.
[00:24:08.953 --> 00:24:09.413]  We'll be right back.
[00:24:09.433 --> 00:24:09.754]  Stay with us.
[00:24:11.138 --> 00:24:12.479]  We're in an information war.
[00:24:12.499 --> 00:24:17.061]  And I don't say this to make myself sound big.
[00:24:17.281 --> 00:24:20.663]  In fact, it gives me chills of concern.
[00:24:21.663 --> 00:24:26.846]  But I'm seen by the globalists as the mad prophet of the worldwide populist movement.
[00:24:26.866 --> 00:24:30.448]  They've called me that on CNN, Time Magazine, the Atlantic Monthly.
[00:24:30.468 --> 00:24:32.189]  They've said he's the wild prophet.
[00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:35.839]  that brought in Trump and brought in all this stuff.
[00:24:35.839 --> 00:24:37.918]  And everybody gets the credit.
[00:24:37.918 --> 00:24:43.950]   A whole bunch of people, hundreds of millions of folks, put up this resistance, this awakening long before I was
[00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:44.240]  born.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.519]  People were fighting it.
[00:24:45.519 --> 00:24:51.759]   My dad was 14, 15 years old every Saturday, driving two hours to Dallas from his farm
[00:24:51.759 --> 00:24:56.239]   to give anti-communist speeches on the radio because he gave such good ones locally,
[00:24:56.239 --> 00:24:59.359]  just off what he read in the John Birch Society stuff.
[00:24:59.359 --> 00:25:01.519]  And I mean, it's in the blood, folks.
[00:25:01.519 --> 00:25:03.200]  So my dad gets the credit.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.319]  My mom's dad gets the credit.
[00:25:06.319 --> 00:25:08.559]   Most of you had family that were aware of this and fought them.
[00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:09.839]  That's why you tuned in.
[00:25:09.839 --> 00:25:11.039]  You're the original audience.
[00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:14.479]   It's hardcore people whose parents and grandparents knew all this stuff.
[00:25:15.345 --> 00:25:19.106]  Okay, so this isn't about the credit, but I am seen as the leader, alright?
[00:25:19.766 --> 00:25:21.786]  And I really don't like that responsibility.
[00:25:22.606 --> 00:25:31.948]  In fact, I wish there were people better than me, more effective than me, and more hardcore than me, who see through all this stuff before other people do, okay?
[00:25:32.248 --> 00:25:34.469]  And I hear callers all the time that are smarter than I am.
[00:25:35.609 --> 00:25:40.610]  I just got in the position, through God's grace, and through your support, to have a huge platform, alright?
[00:25:42.108 --> 00:25:54.682]  And that's why I tell you, we need your prayers, we need your support, because I can't spend any of the time telling you what's going on behind the scenes, because it's a distraction, and I don't want the enemy to know how their targeting's working, so I can't even get into it.
[00:25:54.722 --> 00:25:56.443]  But just believe me, I've gone through hell.
[00:25:56.884 --> 00:25:59.306]  Believe me, I've gone through horrible things, and it's okay.
[00:25:59.887 --> 00:26:01.408]  I just want to win, and I want to beat these people.
[00:26:01.869 --> 00:26:08.775]  But I need your prayers, and I need your support, and I need you to spread the word, and I need you to understand that we're the best there is in this fight.
[00:26:08.855 --> 00:26:10.737]  That means all of you, the listeners and viewers.
[00:26:11.238 --> 00:26:12.238]  And that means this great crew.
[00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:18.544]  This is really serious business, and it's not just economic, it's not just cultural, it's not just financial.
[00:26:18.965 --> 00:26:19.926]  It's spiritual.
[00:26:20.506 --> 00:26:21.067]  That's 90% of it.
[00:26:22.688 --> 00:26:26.049]  All right, and so I need your prayer first and foremost, and America needs your prayer.
[00:26:26.629 --> 00:26:30.890]  Because listen, we are really kicking the globalists' butts right now.
[00:26:31.771 --> 00:26:33.271]  This was a wrestling match right now.
[00:26:33.691 --> 00:26:36.592]  We got them pinned to the ground and their face shoved in the ground.
[00:26:38.333 --> 00:26:45.875]  The problem is they can sit there and piss themselves, crap themselves is the analogy I'd use, and start a nuclear war.
[00:26:47.065 --> 00:26:48.846]  Now, we got their arm cranked behind their back.
[00:26:49.046 --> 00:26:50.586]  Their shoulder's already out of socket.
[00:26:50.706 --> 00:26:51.766]  They're in total pain.
[00:26:52.247 --> 00:26:53.687]  They've found Jesus now.
[00:26:54.847 --> 00:26:55.467]  The wrath of it.
[00:26:55.948 --> 00:26:59.289]  And they are hitting the panic button.
[00:26:59.649 --> 00:27:01.089]  They've not tapped out yet.
[00:27:01.229 --> 00:27:04.210]  They need to tap out right now.
[00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.111]  But evil isn't going to tap out.
[00:27:06.731 --> 00:27:11.012]  So, just know, this is the most serious time in world history.
[00:27:11.032 --> 00:27:11.952]  You don't need me to tell you that.
[00:27:11.992 --> 00:27:12.612]  You can see it.
[00:27:12.913 --> 00:27:13.573]  You can feel it.
[00:27:13.613 --> 00:27:14.413]  You can smell it.
[00:27:15.896 --> 00:27:21.219]  And I'm just getting excited because I'm finally seeing people that are as effective as I am.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.361]  Tucker Carlson is as effective or more.
[00:27:24.761 --> 00:27:27.543]  People like Drew Hernandez is as effective or more.
[00:27:28.524 --> 00:27:30.365]  Steve Bannon is very effective.
[00:27:33.026 --> 00:27:35.288]  There's a lot of people now that are really, really effective.
[00:27:35.328 --> 00:27:38.510]  If Joe Rogan wanted to be effective, you know, he kind of plays both sides.
[00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:42.092]  I love Joe, but the reason I get mad at him is he knows every damn bit of this.
[00:27:42.432 --> 00:27:43.533]  He's as smart as a whip.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:28:00.398]   General Flynn super smart he gets what's going on, but he's a little reserved So he doesn't really turn it on when he gives speeches like he does in private And so he's almost embarrassed to use his his charisma but And I get that.
[00:28:00.538 --> 00:28:02.902]  You know, why should General Flynn run for president?
[00:28:02.922 --> 00:28:04.103]  He keeps hoping Trump will do it.
[00:28:04.404 --> 00:28:05.685]  And he kind of defers to that.
[00:28:06.907 --> 00:28:08.649]  But, you know, is Trump everything we need?
[00:28:08.749 --> 00:28:12.494]  I mean, I just don't think we can count on Trump at the end of the day, folks.
[00:28:12.915 --> 00:28:13.776]  And I wish we could.
[00:28:14.777 --> 00:28:32.429]   So I'm just here to tell you again, When we play these clips, the reason they're in panic mode, the reason the globalists are scared, is because you did your due diligence, you did the work, you spread the word, you planted the seeds, you got ridiculed, you got censored, you got attacked, and so now we're in a real fight with the global controllers, alright?
[00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:43.236]  I mean, we got their attention, we are beating the hell out of them, we're politically, non-violently breaking their ribs, gouging out their eyeballs, pulling out their teeth, slamming their head to concrete, okay?
[00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:48.012]  Now the problem is, they got bioweapons labs everywhere.
[00:28:48.272 --> 00:29:00.339]  They got nuclear weapons, they got armies of scum that work for them, pedophiles, devil worshippers, degenerates, and they're really thinking about turning it all loose and causing a giant global civil war and a collapse.
[00:29:00.419 --> 00:29:03.101]  The good news is, they were going to do that regardless.
[00:29:03.601 --> 00:29:07.183]  Now we're going to force them to do it on our terms and we're going to win.
[00:29:07.443 --> 00:29:09.825]  But I got to tell you, it ain't going to be pretty, okay?
[00:29:10.931 --> 00:29:14.392]  All I can offer you, like Churchill said, is blood and sweat and tears.
[00:29:14.832 --> 00:29:19.693]  But in the end, you're on your feet, and you're before God, and you didn't roll over to evil, and we win.
[00:29:20.013 --> 00:29:20.853]  But it's gonna be hell.
[00:29:21.213 --> 00:29:25.014]  But I can offer you nothing but hell in the next ten years.
[00:29:25.374 --> 00:29:27.814]  Nothing but absolute hell!
[00:29:29.234 --> 00:29:30.094]  That's what I offer you!
[00:29:30.815 --> 00:29:31.275]  Reality!
[00:29:31.915 --> 00:29:34.555]  So that you're on your feet, and you know it's coming when it comes!
[00:29:34.895 --> 00:29:38.316]  So you're not in your bed sucking your thumbs when these people hit!
[00:29:39.281 --> 00:29:46.707]  Because if you think getting in a catatonic position like a baby and curling up in a ball is going to protect you, I got news for you, it ain't.
[00:29:48.388 --> 00:29:48.868]  You understand?
[00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:54.253]  These people are devil-worshipping pedophiles.
[00:29:56.134 --> 00:30:04.425]   And they've got their operatives everywhere who Are spiritually ignited and spiritually energized against us.
[00:30:04.845 --> 00:30:05.786]  And they're in the banks.
[00:30:06.246 --> 00:30:07.527]  They're in the police departments.
[00:30:07.808 --> 00:30:08.868]  They're in the law firms.
[00:30:09.129 --> 00:30:10.229]  They're in the universities.
[00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:11.410]  They're in the schools.
[00:30:11.691 --> 00:30:13.152]  They're in the... They're everywhere.
[00:30:15.353 --> 00:30:15.894]  They're everywhere.
[00:30:15.954 --> 00:30:17.235]  Now I'll tell you where you don't find them.
[00:30:17.695 --> 00:30:19.416]  A plumber working a 12-hour day.
[00:30:19.757 --> 00:30:21.238]  A farmer working a 12-hour day.
[00:30:22.554 --> 00:30:27.176]  Those, these people cannot hide in a manual job.
[00:30:27.236 --> 00:30:28.656]  They can never hack it, never do it.
[00:30:28.957 --> 00:30:32.338]  And Thomas Jefferson said he'd studied all the different types of people.
[00:30:32.578 --> 00:30:33.598]  He'd been all over Europe.
[00:30:33.678 --> 00:30:34.499]  Very learned man.
[00:30:34.919 --> 00:30:36.440]  Was in college when he was, you know, 12, 13 years old.
[00:30:39.079 --> 00:30:44.023]  And he said, nobody's better than the farmers, and back then they didn't call them ranchers, the ranchers.
[00:30:44.603 --> 00:30:52.168]  He said, the best people are the farmers, and the hardest working, most successful farmers are the best people, and they should run things, not lawyers.
[00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.629]  And it's true.
[00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.351]  Can you imagine if the Amish ran things?
[00:30:56.371 --> 00:30:56.852]  What would it be like?
[00:30:56.892 --> 00:30:58.213]  But see, they don't want to run things.
[00:30:58.533 --> 00:30:59.554]  That's why they're good.
[00:31:01.803 --> 00:31:09.865]  The evil people want to run things and I know that people like General Flynn is like kind of what I call a military Amish person.
[00:31:09.886 --> 00:31:17.908]  Not only because he's against technology, he thinks it's at a subconscious level a little too worldly to want to be the leader.
[00:31:18.568 --> 00:31:26.611]  A little too pushy to come out and it's just not, well it's a little arrogant, it's a little egotistical.
[00:31:26.671 --> 00:31:27.191]  No it's not!
[00:31:28.166 --> 00:31:28.746]  No it's not!
[00:31:29.447 --> 00:31:31.568]  We're gonna lead or we're gonna die!
[00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:40.612]  Because we're gonna let the Ben Shapiros of the world sit over there and lead our movements when he knows damn well what he's doing and he's not on our side.
[00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:50.236]  And he wants all the conservatives under his control so he can lead them into slavery and lead the rest of us into slavery as Judas Coats.
[00:31:50.936 --> 00:31:52.097]  They're Judas Coats, folks.
[00:31:53.046 --> 00:32:01.346]  For those who don't know, when you want to shear the sheep or even trim them or even take some for slaughter, they know going into the pen is something they don't like.
[00:32:02.742 --> 00:32:11.825]  But you've got the ram, you've got the leader who's been trained to know he never gets hurt when he leads them into the slaughter.
[00:32:12.505 --> 00:32:16.907]  And so the polar opposite of where I want to be is the Judas Goat.
[00:32:17.527 --> 00:32:18.847]  And we know the Judas Goats well.
[00:32:18.867 --> 00:32:26.270]  They're the Al Gore's and they're the Tony Blair's and they're the Ben Shapiro's and they're the Barack Obama's and all the rest of it.
[00:32:27.471 --> 00:32:34.816]  And so, Operation Judas Code is what you could call this, and just say, we're up against a bunch of Judas Codes here, folks.
[00:32:35.376 --> 00:32:36.497]  Well, I'm no Judas Code.
[00:32:37.078 --> 00:32:37.338]  Alright?
[00:32:37.417 --> 00:32:42.537]   I've steered you right, I've told the truth, I've been steadfast, and I need your love.
[00:32:42.537 --> 00:32:43.777]  I need your support.
[00:32:43.777 --> 00:32:46.798]   I need you to lift me up in prayer, and I need your financial support,
[00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:53.377]   InfoWarship.com, because we are on the verge of victory, but we're right there at that moment
[00:32:53.377 --> 00:32:58.157]   where for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction, and we are just right there
[00:32:58.157 --> 00:33:04.177]   in the fight against the new world order, all of us, and we have to have a sense of total commitment
[00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:05.731]  All right, I said I get the clips.
[00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:12.914]  The Davos Group announcing world government, new world order, and then saying they're in trouble, they're falling apart, they're desperate, and they are.
[00:33:13.674 --> 00:33:17.976]  And they're saying that because they're trying to scramble all their minions to take action and beat us.
[00:33:18.636 --> 00:33:21.878]  So they're calling on their forces to up the game.
[00:33:22.178 --> 00:33:23.879]  I'm calling on our forces to up the game.
[00:33:24.139 --> 00:33:25.079]  You want to win this thing?
[00:33:25.099 --> 00:33:26.460]  You got to decide you want to be free.
[00:33:27.828 --> 00:33:31.030]  And we are back, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:32.952]  Please stay with us throughout the full broadcast.
[00:33:32.992 --> 00:33:37.855]  If you can't go to the archive that will be restreaming over the weekend until Sunday, where we go live again at 4 p.m.
[00:33:37.875 --> 00:33:43.919]  Central, and it'll be archived at band.video because we have some huge guests joining us today.
[00:33:44.539 --> 00:33:50.423]  We have Dr. Huff, the main whistleblower exposing the whole COVID operation in studio third hour.
[00:33:50.563 --> 00:33:52.965]  We have Judge Andrew Napolitano, fourth hour.
[00:33:53.105 --> 00:33:57.468]  And I'm going to cover tons of news and open the phones up in the second hour.
[00:33:58.949 --> 00:34:02.471]  Now I have two stacks of news that orbit each other right here, that all tie together.
[00:34:04.093 --> 00:34:08.896]  But no one's making the direct connection except Tucker Carlson, myself, and of course millions of you.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:10.677]  But it's starting to happen.
[00:34:11.818 --> 00:34:13.640]  We're starting to see DeSantis and others do it.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:19.824]  And whether DeSantis is true blue to the end or not, the fact that he's talking like this shows we're winning the information war.
[00:34:20.464 --> 00:34:26.429]  So DeSantis is coming out against the WF, against the New World Order, so is Elon Musk saying it's an unelected world government.
[00:34:27.688 --> 00:34:29.249]  He's coming up with a bunch of initiatives.
[00:34:29.289 --> 00:34:35.672]  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis prescribes Freedom Plan, bans vaccine passports, supports doctors' free speech.
[00:34:36.332 --> 00:34:38.453]  So he supports speech against the tyranny you win.
[00:34:39.834 --> 00:34:50.239]  And then if you support also the fact that they can't make us have vaccine passports or make us take shots, that kills the rollout of their worldwide digital ID.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.761]  Okay, which they admits their whole centerpiece.
[00:34:53.321 --> 00:35:02.100]   So that's just an example of how All over the country and all over the world, laws are being passed, initiatives are being launched to block their initiative.
[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:07.944]  So you expose them that they're bad, you expose their bad initiatives, and I'm stating the obvious here, but people need to get this.
[00:35:10.145 --> 00:35:15.509]  And then you erect laws that educate the public about their rights, and then they can't be slaves.
[00:35:15.609 --> 00:35:16.690]  It's game over.
[00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:19.111]  And that's why they hit the panic button.
[00:35:19.131 --> 00:35:21.173]  I'll go through that stack in a moment, but here's this stack.
[00:35:22.383 --> 00:35:26.126]  DeVos attendees, agenda is to create a new world order.
[00:35:26.487 --> 00:35:29.629]  Great article by Paul Watson, but that's not really the gist.
[00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:32.652]  They go on to say they're losing and failing.
[00:35:32.992 --> 00:35:36.836]  That's the real quote and not just one quote, a bunch of quotes by these people.
[00:35:38.897 --> 00:35:46.003]  A Davos speaker explicitly outlined the World Economic Forum's agenda when he stated the goal was to create a new world order.
[00:35:46.383 --> 00:35:56.232]  The remarks were made during an annual Elitist Confab yesterday by Bilawal Bhutto Zardiyai, Pakistan's Minister of Foreign Affairs.
[00:35:56.832 --> 00:35:58.674]  And the rest of them are saying, we're losing.
[00:35:58.734 --> 00:35:59.594]  We've got to censor.
[00:36:00.015 --> 00:36:01.236]  We've got to rally the troops.
[00:36:01.276 --> 00:36:02.537]  We've got to circle the wagons.
[00:36:03.137 --> 00:36:04.439]  We've got to shut these people down.
[00:36:04.479 --> 00:36:07.481]  We've got to pass laws to make it illegal to criticize us.
[00:36:08.062 --> 00:36:10.504]  Because we're saving the world like extraterrestrials.
[00:36:11.044 --> 00:36:12.506]  We're going to take your bodies over.
[00:36:12.626 --> 00:36:13.346]  You'll own nothing.
[00:36:13.386 --> 00:36:14.087]  You'll have nothing.
[00:36:14.107 --> 00:36:14.948]  You're not going to have meat.
[00:36:15.268 --> 00:36:16.289]  Your children are ours.
[00:36:17.149 --> 00:36:20.032]  You live in a 250 square foot coffin apartment.
[00:36:20.412 --> 00:36:22.514]  On and on and on and on.
[00:36:22.794 --> 00:36:23.315]  Here's the clip.
[00:36:24.285 --> 00:36:29.685]   of the global south. Here at WEF I believe we're discussing, there's a lot of
[00:36:29.685 --> 00:36:33.845]   discussion about what the new world order will be or how even in the
[00:36:33.845 --> 00:36:40.085]   context of our new Helsinki, how do we work towards that new normative
[00:36:40.085 --> 00:36:44.484]   international order that allows us to address our differences and disputes as
[00:36:44.484 --> 00:36:50.685]   the civilized world. And I believe perhaps we are at the moment in such a
[00:36:50.685 --> 00:36:56.164]   hyper partisan, hyper polarized time that we're not going to be able to form
[00:36:56.164 --> 00:37:01.364]  that new Helsinki today.
[00:37:00.026 --> 00:37:11.173]  But I hope going forward we are able to do, I mean we must, we must form and improve our normative and international institutional order internationally so that we can address these complaints.
[00:37:11.373 --> 00:37:17.291]   I hope this time around, once we're building this new world order or new rules-based order,
[00:37:17.291 --> 00:37:27.532]   the voice of the global South and the developing world is included.
[00:37:27.554 --> 00:37:29.457]  And we're going to come back.
[00:37:30.828 --> 00:37:31.789]  Later you'll see more clips.
[00:37:31.809 --> 00:37:33.129]  We have plenty of time left in this segment.
[00:37:33.429 --> 00:37:35.110]  Let's go to Al Gore talking about that.
[00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:39.312]  Now, this is only a couple minute clip, but I could again teach a college course on this.
[00:37:39.953 --> 00:37:41.533]  Everything he says is what he's doing.
[00:37:41.954 --> 00:37:43.254]  They're collapsing the third world.
[00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:44.455]  They cut off the resources.
[00:37:44.495 --> 00:37:45.696]  They had a two-year lockdown.
[00:37:45.976 --> 00:37:47.236]  They're organizing the flooding.
[00:37:47.517 --> 00:37:56.461]  And he holds you hostage and says, if you don't let us bring in a world government and cut off more of the resources, more people will flood you.
[00:37:56.521 --> 00:37:57.742]  Global warming's doing it.
[00:37:58.382 --> 00:38:06.908]  Just like he said, global warming, he and all of them have said it, Peter Daszak, Bill Gates, all of them, Klaus Schwab, that the viruses are coming from the hot jungles.
[00:38:07.308 --> 00:38:10.371]  They're going to kill you to do what we say.
[00:38:12.179 --> 00:38:16.341]  No, it came out of a lab you guys financed and controlled, and then you ran the global response to it.
[00:38:17.081 --> 00:38:26.404]  So this is such an important clip, because here he is saying, replacement migration's here, you better do what we say or we'll flood you with a billion people, which is what their plan is.
[00:38:26.965 --> 00:38:28.365]  Two hundred and something million in Europe.
[00:38:28.685 --> 00:38:31.546]  Six hundred and sixty-something million in the United States.
[00:38:31.586 --> 00:38:32.387]  That's the official plan.
[00:38:32.507 --> 00:38:33.387]  It's on the UN website.
[00:38:33.427 --> 00:38:35.348]  Just go type in replacement migration on it.
[00:38:35.888 --> 00:38:38.309]  That's official policy of these people.
[00:38:38.709 --> 00:38:40.929]  Then you add all the other places, it's over a billion people.
[00:38:41.169 --> 00:38:45.130]  So he's stating the blueprint, he's stating the plan as if he's trying to save you from it.
[00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:50.291]  No, we need to make the third world powerful and enriched and wonderful, and then we can go both ways.
[00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:56.693]  I'd love Africa to be built up in Latin America and safe, and then go visit there or live there or have a business there.
[00:38:56.913 --> 00:38:57.893]  But no, no, no, no, no.
[00:38:58.173 --> 00:39:02.114]  They create the crisis, then they offer the order, which is more crisis.
[00:39:03.115 --> 00:39:14.518]  And Gore then goes on to claim that every day of our fossil fuels, boiling the oceans, killing everything, is the equivalent of hundreds of atomic bombs being detonated.
[00:39:14.558 --> 00:39:16.139]  No, I'm sorry, he said thousands, excuse me.
[00:39:16.459 --> 00:39:19.699]  Thousands of nuclear bombs and just total made-up crap.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.500]  One big gaseous Mount St.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.821]  Helens puts out more particulate and more gas and more carbon.
[00:39:25.121 --> 00:39:28.822]  There's studies, look it up, than all of the Industrial Revolution.
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:30.981]  Of the last 200 years.
[00:39:31.742 --> 00:39:32.402]  They know that.
[00:39:32.442 --> 00:39:33.523]  It's part of our atmosphere.
[00:39:33.743 --> 00:39:35.024]  It's why we have an atmosphere.
[00:39:35.505 --> 00:39:43.932]  They've even listed carbon dioxide that plants breathe, and they put off more oxygen is a bad thing, even though we know in Earth's history, carbon dioxide's been much higher, and it's healthier for everybody.
[00:39:44.593 --> 00:39:46.114]  So it's a total fraud.
[00:39:46.154 --> 00:39:47.375]  They prey on the interests of the public.
[00:39:47.616 --> 00:39:49.177]  They prey on the brainwashing in schools.
[00:39:49.537 --> 00:39:54.721]   And here he is, turning... Remember, he said in his inconvenient truth, What was it, 20 years ago?
[00:39:55.442 --> 00:40:07.657]  That by the year 2017, sea levels would rise more than two feet, and that most of the coast of the United States would be underwater, including Florida, while he bought houses right on the beach, along with Bill Gates and Barack Obama and the rest of them.
[00:40:08.058 --> 00:40:11.722]  Lies, lies, lies, more, more lies!
[00:40:12.583 --> 00:40:15.529]  In fact, let's come in with that ministry song, start of the next hour.
[00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.909]  Lies!
[00:40:16.591 --> 00:40:16.791]  Lies!
[00:40:17.953 --> 00:40:18.414]  Lies!
[00:40:19.757 --> 00:40:22.542]  I forget the exact name of the song, but there you go.
[00:40:23.103 --> 00:40:24.987]  So let's go ahead and play that clip of Al Gore.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:35.748]  The accumulated amount is now trapping as much extra heat as would be released by 600,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding every single day on the earth.
[00:40:36.028 --> 00:40:52.001]   That's what's boiling the oceans, creating these atmospheric rivers and the rain bombs and sucking the moisture out of the land and creating the droughts and melting the ice and raising the sea level and causing these waves of climate refugees predicted to reach One billion in this century?
[00:40:52.241 --> 00:40:58.826]  Look at the xenophobia and political authoritarian trends that have come from just a few million refugees.
[00:40:58.946 --> 00:40:59.827]  What about a billion?
[00:41:00.087 --> 00:41:03.630]  We would lose our capacity for self-governance on this world.
[00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:05.671]  We have to act.
[00:41:06.092 --> 00:41:14.658]  So in answer to your question, I would say we have to have a sense of urgency much greater than we have yet had.
[00:41:14.738 --> 00:41:16.640]  And we need to make some changes.
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:25.332]  He's a co-owner with Prince Charles and with Barack Obama and a bunch of other globalists of Gore and Blood.
[00:41:25.432 --> 00:41:26.213]  I'm not joking.
[00:41:26.534 --> 00:41:30.981]  The other co-owner, head owner is, last name's Blood.
[00:41:31.481 --> 00:41:32.203]  Gore and Blood.
[00:41:35.165 --> 00:41:39.290]  Gore and Blood, and he's made billions, not 330 million.
[00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:41.773]  He has billions in carbon credits.
[00:41:42.234 --> 00:41:47.861]  He has billions of dollars off of his scam that Enron developed in the 80s, didn't get launched in the 90s.
[00:41:47.881 --> 00:41:51.825]  Yes, Enron, look it up, developed the whole carbon tax scam.
[00:41:53.035 --> 00:41:55.096]  By the way, Tucker Carlson always just gets better and better.
[00:41:55.116 --> 00:42:00.858]  He knocked it out of the park last night in a nine-minute analysis of this that I'm going to air at the end of the next hour.
[00:42:00.898 --> 00:42:03.458]  It's on Infowars.com if you want to see it.
[00:42:03.478 --> 00:42:10.080]  The other is Al Gore and David Blood told us how it's possible to save the world while still making a lot of money.
[00:42:11.481 --> 00:42:14.262]  And the world's going to end in 2030, he told you, unless you do what he wants.
[00:42:14.322 --> 00:42:20.864]  But if you do what he wants, cut off the carbon, get rid of the borders, starve the people, the world as you know it will be over.
[00:42:22.731 --> 00:42:26.633]  But there are leaders all over the world and initiatives that are blocking it and stopping it.
[00:42:27.113 --> 00:42:30.714]  And again, our awakening rate is explosive.
[00:42:30.774 --> 00:42:36.136]  That's why they just said we're not going to get our world government rules based New World Order yet.
[00:42:36.857 --> 00:42:37.597]  But we'll get it.
[00:42:38.137 --> 00:42:39.077]  We'll get it in the future.
[00:42:39.538 --> 00:42:40.238]  And their plan is.
[00:42:42.281 --> 00:43:02.438]  Flood a few hundred million into Europe and the U.S., have them controlled by the deep state with their universal basic incomes, and have them pull the lever to vote to ban your farms, your cows, parental rights, everything else, your guns, everything else that gives them full control over you and your body and that of your family.
[00:43:02.498 --> 00:43:09.003]  This is total high-tech, massive slavery by self-appointed world government criminals.
[00:43:09.764 --> 00:43:24.063]   And Elon Musk If anything, it's a highly intelligent opportunist, and notice more and more he's siding with us, because he knows this current system isn't hunting, isn't flying, isn't floating, ain't cranking.
[00:43:24.504 --> 00:43:26.725]  No, we are winning!
[00:43:27.005 --> 00:43:28.346]  Do you understand that?
[00:43:28.426 --> 00:43:32.426]   We're not just fighting back because it's right, we're fighting back and winning!
[00:43:32.426 --> 00:43:40.426]  [Intro Music]
[00:43:41.426 --> 00:43:45.426]  Here's what you can expect at Davos this year.
[00:43:45.426 --> 00:43:51.426]   Where our unelected overlord, Klaus Schwab, asks this very important question.
[00:43:51.742 --> 00:43:54.345]  What does it need to master the future?
[00:43:54.825 --> 00:44:03.334]  This year's annual meeting takes place amid a global cost-of-living crisis, and during Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.
[00:44:04.417 --> 00:44:21.244]  By bringing the planet's politicians, business and civil leaders together in the same building, the meeting offers a key opportunity, like the clear and present danger of disinformation panel discussion, led by former CNN Arbiter of Truth, Brian Stelter.
[00:44:21.824 --> 00:44:22.644]  I leave CNN.
[00:44:22.664 --> 00:44:24.145]  I was arrested by military police.
[00:44:24.554 --> 00:44:28.896]  Brian recently had a run-in with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:44:29.316 --> 00:44:30.497]  Here's how it went down.
[00:44:32.558 --> 00:44:33.958]  There's nothing you can do!
[00:44:34.238 --> 00:44:35.779]  We're gonna rape your body!
[00:44:35.799 --> 00:44:37.220]  Rape your medical rights!
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.640]  Rape your children's minds!
[00:44:38.881 --> 00:44:40.361]  We're gonna ship-sink the land!
[00:44:40.561 --> 00:44:42.142]  We're gonna destroy every facet!
[00:44:42.362 --> 00:44:43.403]  Hollywood rules!
[00:44:48.132 --> 00:44:52.655]  Economic growth increasingly depends on building a green global economy.
[00:44:53.116 --> 00:44:58.960]  At Davos, the First Movers Coalition will convene to discuss progress towards this goal.
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:11.208]  It's a group of 65 companies working to decarbonize the sectors responsible for 30% of global emissions, including heavy industry and long-distance transport.
[00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:13.830]  To follow the annual meeting 2023, visit our website.
[00:45:16.112 --> 00:45:21.911]   Working towards a safe and secure society. I'm the tyrannical lyft
[00:45:43.711 --> 00:45:48.043]   There are of course those who do not want us to speak Let me think, just let me think.
[00:45:48.063 --> 00:45:53.608]  In fact, even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:45:53.648 --> 00:45:55.110]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:55.690]  Damn it!
[00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:56.031]  Why?
[00:45:56.751 --> 00:46:02.717]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:46:03.378 --> 00:46:06.501]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[00:46:09.275 --> 00:46:14.080]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.100]  You decided, sir.
[00:46:15.161 --> 00:46:16.061]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:46:16.081 --> 00:46:17.463]  You told me every television in London!
[00:46:17.743 --> 00:46:19.825]  Cruelty and injustice.
[00:46:19.845 --> 00:46:21.226]  Intolerance and oppression.
[00:46:21.646 --> 00:46:31.756]  And where once you had the freedom to object and think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and subduing your submissiveness.
[00:46:32.496 --> 00:46:33.898]  How did this happen?
[00:46:33.958 --> 00:46:34.698]  Who's to blame?
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.385]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:46:38.725 --> 00:46:40.368]  They will be held accountable.
[00:46:40.689 --> 00:46:46.138]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:46:47.342 --> 00:46:48.763]  I know why you did it.
[00:46:48.823 --> 00:46:51.586]  I know you were afraid, cahooting me.
[00:46:52.066 --> 00:46:54.128]  War, terror, disease.
[00:46:54.749 --> 00:47:01.114]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:47:01.194 --> 00:47:06.939]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:14.400]   He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:21.400]  There is a war.
[00:47:22.122 --> 00:47:23.123]  It's happening now.
[00:47:23.843 --> 00:47:25.803]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:47:26.384 --> 00:47:28.164]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:47:28.984 --> 00:47:30.465]  We are the resistance.
[00:47:30.885 --> 00:47:33.146]  We are the Infowar.
[00:47:37.727 --> 00:47:41.168]  So I had a distant relative suffering from seizures.
[00:47:42.008 --> 00:47:44.729]  And they called me and asked me, what should we get?
[00:47:45.581 --> 00:47:53.767]  And I said, look, you should try CBD because CBDA has this effect with people and, you know, anti-seizure effects.
[00:47:54.167 --> 00:47:55.128]  And I said, you got to try this.
[00:47:55.168 --> 00:48:00.431]  So I bought on your store two vials of your CBD, 1000 milligrams.
[00:48:00.871 --> 00:48:03.233]  I couldn't believe the price that you had.
[00:48:03.693 --> 00:48:04.854]  It was so low.
[00:48:05.034 --> 00:48:10.258]  I mean, the value of that, if people know this industry, the price is very, very good.
[00:48:10.938 --> 00:48:12.799]  I sent a bottle to my family member.
[00:48:12.959 --> 00:48:14.059]  I kept the bottle for myself.
[00:48:14.639 --> 00:48:18.480]  And then my family member was using it, having amazing results.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.701]  I sent a bottle.
[00:48:20.441 --> 00:48:31.524]  Well, my lab director was working on a new method to quantitate cannabinoids, about 10 or 12 of them, using a single four-minute method on an LC-MS instrument, a mass spec instrument.
[00:48:31.924 --> 00:48:36.366]  And she asked me, hey, do you have a sample of CBD oil that we can test on this method?
[00:48:36.686 --> 00:48:37.946]  And I said, OK, sure.
[00:48:38.286 --> 00:48:39.947]  So I gave her a sample blind.
[00:48:40.647 --> 00:48:43.469]  She didn't know it was Infowars or any brand or anything.
[00:48:43.509 --> 00:48:44.410]  Gave it to her blind.
[00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:48.173]  She ran the sample, got the results, and, wow, this is a full profile.
[00:48:48.193 --> 00:48:49.013]  It's a full spectrum.
[00:48:49.214 --> 00:48:50.314]  It's got CBD-A in it.
[00:48:50.374 --> 00:48:51.695]  I said, yeah, of course it does.
[00:48:52.096 --> 00:48:52.896]  It's got CBD.
[00:48:53.196 --> 00:48:55.458]  And it's, you know, super, super low THC.
[00:48:55.698 --> 00:48:57.540]  We have tests for Delta-9 and all that stuff.
[00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:02.323]  And I asked her, I said, okay, you've tested about 100 CBD products.
[00:49:02.783 --> 00:49:06.766]  What do you think this product would cost in the marketplace, just looking at the lab results?
[00:49:07.207 --> 00:49:07.507]  She said, $150.
[00:49:09.714 --> 00:49:11.915]  You know, in the same volume that you have.
[00:49:12.275 --> 00:49:13.195]  I just looked at your store.
[00:49:13.675 --> 00:49:18.117]  This is, I think, $67 or $68 on InfoWars store.
[00:49:19.377 --> 00:49:20.098]  No joke, Alex.
[00:49:20.138 --> 00:49:28.360]  And you know, you didn't ask me to talk about this, but I got to tell you, just independently, this CBD product that you have is an outstanding value.
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.041]  It's outstanding.
[00:49:29.101 --> 00:49:31.481]  I'm taking it myself, and it's helping my family members.
[00:49:31.521 --> 00:49:33.062]  So I just want to put that on the record.
[00:49:33.122 --> 00:49:33.742]  It's the real deal.
[00:49:33.862 --> 00:49:35.223]  Well, I appreciate that.
[00:49:35.263 --> 00:49:36.043]  I didn't know that happened.
[00:49:36.083 --> 00:49:38.744]  I mean, here's all that happened with the InfoWars MD line.
[00:49:39.444 --> 00:49:45.069]  We went out looking for new suppliers because we were getting blocked everywhere and having issues getting the stuff we wanted, as you know, with supply chain breakdowns.
[00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:51.694]  We ran into two big companies that are listeners, and this particular company said, we have over 50 products, most of them are already top sellers.
[00:49:52.175 --> 00:49:53.776]  And I said, well, what do you think your best products are?
[00:49:53.816 --> 00:49:59.441]  They said, well, this is wide-spectrum CBD that we sell under a couple different names in stores and at medical clinics for about $120 to $150.
[00:49:59.481 --> 00:50:02.043]  We recommend you sell it for $100, and we got to buy it for like $30.
[00:50:05.646 --> 00:50:08.628]  And I just said, no, we're going to double our monies enough.
[00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:14.732]  So, yes, this is $100 to $120, especially the thousand milligram one, CBD for about half the price.
[00:50:14.792 --> 00:50:16.013]  And so you nailed it.
[00:50:16.073 --> 00:50:16.473]  Absolutely.
[00:50:16.493 --> 00:50:18.154]  Because I'm not a big top tester like you.
[00:50:18.194 --> 00:50:20.295]  And I just go out and say, what's top rated?
[00:50:20.316 --> 00:50:21.416]  Who's already got the best test?
[00:50:21.696 --> 00:50:22.257]  Who is that?
[00:50:22.337 --> 00:50:24.378]  And then that way we know it's already built in that it's quality.
[00:50:24.398 --> 00:50:25.439]  So thank you for the support.
[00:50:25.859 --> 00:50:27.300]  It has to be processed correctly.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.942]  And whoever you're using as your source, they know how to do that to maintain it.
[00:50:31.022 --> 00:50:33.224]  So it keeps all those molecules in their form.
[00:50:33.524 --> 00:50:34.965]  CBD is very delicate.
[00:50:35.505 --> 00:50:36.866]  And it can be destroyed through heat.
[00:50:38.047 --> 00:50:39.288]  Lies!
[00:50:40.769 --> 00:50:41.830]  Lies!
[00:50:42.711 --> 00:50:43.992]  You lie!
[00:50:47.475 --> 00:50:49.475]  LIFE!
[00:50:49.475 --> 00:50:59.074]   The globalists have stolen the world Bye.
[00:50:59.464 --> 00:51:00.245]  It's not theirs.
[00:51:00.285 --> 00:51:01.566]  They've hijacked humanity.
[00:51:03.743 --> 00:51:10.187]  And just as a hijacker isn't the real pilot of an aircraft, these people have less legitimacy than a hijacker.
[00:51:11.348 --> 00:51:13.629]  All right, very exciting news here.
[00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:22.474]  The incredible whistleblower, Dr. Andrew Huff, showed up early, being the good soldier he is.
[00:51:23.355 --> 00:51:35.696]   So instead of just having an hour with him in studio, the ultimate cub and whistleblower, We are going to go to him in the last segment of this hour.
[00:51:35.736 --> 00:51:38.238]  So we have six segments with him.
[00:51:39.099 --> 00:51:41.921]  And then Judge Andrew Napolitano is going to be joining us.
[00:51:41.941 --> 00:51:43.262]  So I'm not going to take calls today.
[00:51:44.263 --> 00:51:48.346]  But I will open the phones up Sunday night.
[00:51:48.406 --> 00:51:52.049]  And I think I'm going to give Owen Schroer Sunday night off.
[00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:55.311]  Because I do two hours, four to six.
[00:51:55.331 --> 00:51:56.832]  He does six to eight Sunday live.
[00:51:56.852 --> 00:51:58.514]  I'm going to do four hours of phone calls.
[00:51:59.958 --> 00:52:00.579]  Sunday night.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:15.549]  In fact, I'm just going to come in, do like 10 minutes of news, play a few clips, and then I'm going to do three hours and 45 minutes of phone calls Sunday night on stations across the country and Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:52:16.129 --> 00:52:25.916]  Remember, if you're trying to share Infowars.com forward slash show, Facebook, Instagram, Google, Twitter, they all block it, but the URL you can share is conspiracyfact.info.
[00:52:27.235 --> 00:52:32.515]   conspiracyfact.info and by the way I checked that yesterday and it looked
[00:52:32.515 --> 00:52:36.394]   like they were still running Tuesday's show on there and I asked folks to fix
[00:52:36.394 --> 00:52:40.074]   it I don't know they did but will you guys check conspiracyfact.info and
[00:52:40.074 --> 00:52:43.474]   make sure we're currently running the current stream on there that's a little
[00:52:43.474 --> 00:52:48.914]   little little little factoid and the only other thing I want to make sure is
[00:52:48.914 --> 00:52:53.594]   in the b-roll promo video that airs the front of every Bandit video video I
[00:52:53.594 --> 00:52:56.594]   I noticed yesterday we're still running the promo for Tuesday's show.
[00:52:56.587 --> 00:53:03.210]  Nobody's mad, I just somehow catch all this stuff and so I'll forget by the time I get to break, so I got to say it live on air.
[00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:08.672]  We got to kind of command from the front here and even manage the show right here live on air.
[00:53:08.712 --> 00:53:09.713]  I'm kind of directing everything.
[00:53:10.721 --> 00:53:44.833]   While we're here quite quite the job the crews doing a great job There's a lot of a lot of little things out there to watch a lot of little things to do okay, so We have a lot of interesting big things happening and I could sit here and I could cover all the different little pieces of news and I did hit some of those in a moment and But you have to understand, the pedophilia being promoted in children, the sexualization of children, all comes out of the big corporate combines that run the WEF and the UN and all of it.
[00:53:45.473 --> 00:53:50.176]  That's their break up the family, turn us into atomized, totally alone people program.
[00:53:51.236 --> 00:53:58.961]  And I can sit there and talk about the open border and show you what's happening now and how terrible it is, the human smuggling, and we do cover that, but they're the ones running it, the UN's in control of our policy.
[00:54:00.126 --> 00:54:09.470]  Trump did a great thing taking that away from the UN, but the UN Treaty on Refugee Resettlement is back in place, and that's why the UN's in charge of our military and the Border Patrol.
[00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:10.230]  Kind of a big deal.
[00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:12.651]  So see, my brain works like this.
[00:54:13.071 --> 00:54:19.754]  I never sit there and talk about the problem without connecting it to who's behind it and then the solution.
[00:54:21.892 --> 00:54:30.038]  So I don't get up here and talk about the Steven Crowder, Ben Shapiro, Daily Wire story because as itself, it's not important enough to cover.
[00:54:30.118 --> 00:54:34.561]  I mean, Steven's a great guy, very important, but just to talk about the fight, like, oh, look, there's a fight.
[00:54:35.261 --> 00:54:37.182]  Oh, here, let's all gather around and see who wins.
[00:54:38.003 --> 00:54:48.510]  I had to weigh in on that because I saw the Disinfo Live that Steven Crowder recorded the Daily Wire and all the rest of this because he wanted more money if he went to work for him.
[00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:49.571]  No, he's on the tapes.
[00:54:50.856 --> 00:54:53.818]  Saying, I don't even want the money, I want freedom.
[00:54:54.738 --> 00:55:04.885]  And you guys sent me a contract saying Big Tech will be my boss, and if they censor me, I'll have my pay cut and be locked in a contract to not be able to work anywhere for five years.
[00:55:05.265 --> 00:55:09.447]  I'm not going to take your deal, but respond to me about what you're doing to people.
[00:55:09.487 --> 00:55:10.648]  This is un-American.
[00:55:11.008 --> 00:55:12.009]  This is dangerous.
[00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:16.652]  You've got all the Ben Shapiro saying the shot works, we should all take it.
[00:55:18.559 --> 00:55:21.882]  And, you know, all his pro-New World Order stuff, they're gatekeepers, people.
[00:55:22.242 --> 00:55:24.123]  And I'm not in competition with Ben Shapiro.
[00:55:24.644 --> 00:55:30.929]  I could snap my fingers and have billions of dollars of funding, hundreds of millions of dollars of funding, without even trying, from the system.
[00:55:30.969 --> 00:55:33.431]  They would still take me selling out to them.
[00:55:33.851 --> 00:55:35.192]  It's easy to go sell out.
[00:55:35.512 --> 00:55:36.813]  It's easy to be a gatekeeper.
[00:55:37.134 --> 00:55:37.874]  It's easy to do that.
[00:55:38.335 --> 00:55:39.816]  I'm not even mad at these people.
[00:55:39.856 --> 00:55:40.977]  I'm ashamed for them.
[00:55:42.972 --> 00:55:51.351]  And here's Crowder getting better and better and understanding this, and he's always been a good guy, and then he tries to expose it in a very friendly way.
[00:55:52.796 --> 00:55:57.997]  And they attack him and say, oh, Stephen Crowder's a monster.
[00:55:59.037 --> 00:56:04.419]  Stephen Crowder, we offered him $50 million over five years, and he called it slave wages.
[00:56:04.499 --> 00:56:19.702]  No, they said in the recording about all the other little people that together have a giant audience, my little 100,000 followers, a million followers, they have big followings, but compared to Alex Jones or Joe Rogan or Stephen Crowder or Ben Shapiro, it's small, but together it's bigger.
[00:56:20.799 --> 00:56:26.462]  And then they use their algorithms to feed you all into the Jordan Peterson's and the Ben Shapiro's.
[00:56:27.483 --> 00:56:36.708]  And by the way, I think Ben Shapiro is all hat and no cattle and a bunch of repeated, you know, stuff he does to act smart and talk fast, like an auctioneer or something.
[00:56:37.329 --> 00:56:41.411]  Jordan Peterson's legitimately smart and legitimately knows what he's talking about.
[00:56:41.671 --> 00:56:42.372]  He's not a fake.
[00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:46.252]  That said, he pulls his punches really, really bad.
[00:56:46.812 --> 00:57:02.821]  But we're moving the Overton window to expose the New World Order and the globalists and the pedophiles and all of it, making the Ben Shapiros and making the Jordan Petersons come over there because their audience is awake and gets upset if they don't tell the truth.
[00:57:03.161 --> 00:57:12.342]   So I've been monitoring it for a long time and really, if I had to describe why Infowars is so important, Is we're like a gravity?
[00:57:12.382 --> 00:57:13.943]  Well, like a sun.
[00:57:14.963 --> 00:57:16.064]  And it's got a big gravity.
[00:57:16.584 --> 00:57:18.245]  And people know we're telling the truth.
[00:57:18.285 --> 00:57:19.506]  They know we're ahead of our time.
[00:57:19.806 --> 00:57:21.227]  We know we don't pull punches.
[00:57:22.047 --> 00:57:26.890]  And so we popularize liberty and all these issues when the general public knows what's going on.
[00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:40.040]   And then that's enough of a large minority of people Whether it's a Democrat politician, a Republican politician, or a Labor politician, or a Social Democrat politician, wherever you are in the world, people see through it and know the agenda.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:55.093]  And then when they see Crenshaw's and Shapiro's clearly there, not just to make as much money as they can, but clearly to laugh and giggle how they control the conservative movement, how they're a little globalist, and how, you know, they're the real elite.
[00:57:57.096 --> 00:58:01.417]  They have to go on air and apologize for pushing the shots, just like Piers Morgan does.
[00:58:02.377 --> 00:58:04.757]  He's funded by Fox with a show over in the UK.
[00:58:05.377 --> 00:58:06.198]  Why does he have to do that?
[00:58:06.238 --> 00:58:10.338]  Because enough of his listeners are pissed, he's got to be forced to admit.
[00:58:10.358 --> 00:58:15.119]  And by the way, when I did that interview over a week ago with Piers Morgan, I hadn't seen it, I hadn't watched it since.
[00:58:15.439 --> 00:58:16.779]  We played a few clips the crew got.
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:23.301]  I went this Sunday and spent about an hour watching it and reading the comments.
[00:58:23.361 --> 00:58:24.161]  And there was 9,000 comments then.
[00:58:26.411 --> 00:58:27.172]  Sure it's more now.
[00:58:28.194 --> 00:58:32.321]  And they were 99% pro Alex Jones.
[00:58:33.784 --> 00:58:34.305]  On YouTube.
[00:58:35.808 --> 00:58:37.571]  It had like 400,000 views Sunday.
[00:58:37.591 --> 00:58:38.552]  I don't know what it is now.
[00:58:39.773 --> 00:58:41.634]  And I sat there for like an hour.
[00:58:41.694 --> 00:58:43.495]  My wife's like, I'm sitting there on the iPad.
[00:58:44.035 --> 00:58:45.556]  Hey, you said you're taking off today.
[00:58:45.596 --> 00:58:48.437]  We're going to go with family on a hike and go, go eat dinner.
[00:58:49.077 --> 00:58:50.077]  Why are you doing this?
[00:58:50.538 --> 00:58:52.579]  And I said, well, I just want to be able to tell my audience 99%.
[00:58:53.099 --> 00:58:55.900]  So I had to read like a thousand comments, speed read.
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:58.961]  And I found like one out of a hundred.
[00:58:59.922 --> 00:59:00.082]  Sure.
[00:59:00.122 --> 00:59:02.463]  I'd read over a hundred comments where I found one comment against me.
[00:59:02.723 --> 00:59:04.284]  I mean, come on, come on.
[00:59:04.604 --> 00:59:05.544]  You guys are done.
[00:59:06.565 --> 00:59:07.045]  You're done.
[00:59:08.058 --> 00:59:10.839]  And so I wish Ben Shapiro had a soul.
[00:59:10.859 --> 00:59:13.820]  I wish these guys were like me, but they're not.
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.200]  They're opportunists, globals that think you're stupid.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:16.780]  And guess what?
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:17.481]  You're not stupid.
[00:59:17.701 --> 00:59:21.002]  And they're going to be defeated just like Klaus Schwab and just like Bill Gates.
[00:59:21.382 --> 00:59:21.942]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:21.962 --> 00:59:22.342]  Stay with us.
[00:59:23.662 --> 00:59:24.042]  All right.
[00:59:24.683 --> 00:59:30.921]   I don't normally air An entire Tucker Carlson monologue, and we'll have time to get to most of it next segment.
[00:59:31.582 --> 00:59:35.605]  I'm going to bring Dr. Huff in here early at the end of the hour, so we have over an hour with him.
[00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:37.967]  And I'm going to air this Tucker Carlson segment.
[00:59:38.007 --> 00:59:39.809]  It's not the whole segment, but it's about 90% of it.
[00:59:40.289 --> 00:59:46.454]  The full segment I'm going to have posted on the live show feed at InfoWars.com, because he did a hole-in-one event.
[00:59:47.135 --> 00:59:54.962]  His nine-and-a-half, ten-minute segment is absolutely true and nails it better than anybody can.
[00:59:57.077 --> 00:59:59.180]  And that's what this is really all about.
[01:00:00.042 --> 01:00:01.404]  So that's coming up next segment.
[01:00:03.106 --> 01:00:07.954]  And then we're going to get our special guest, a real hero here in studio.
[01:00:10.493 --> 01:00:26.197]  Dr. Andrew Huff, and I gotta tell ya, when I was walking back and forth with my audience, all of us taking care of business, I saw him and I wanted to go shake his hand, he's such a hero, but I gotta put out fires back there, so even during this next 10 minutes while we're airing this Dr. Carlson thing, I'm gonna be dealing with issues behind the scenes here, just for us to stay on air.
[01:00:26.638 --> 01:00:34.060]  That's how serious this situation is, because they know we've broken through, they know we've exposed their whole agenda, they know they're going down.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.300]  I wanna play this clip one more time.
[01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:37.424]  This is the Davos Group.
[01:00:37.624 --> 01:00:43.130]  Agenda is to create a new world order and they admit they're losing and they're not getting their new world order.
[01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:49.015]  Here is the Foreign Minister of Pakistan admitting that their agenda is falling apart.
[01:00:49.035 --> 01:00:52.379]  I'm going to get to some of the other clips from the WEF.
[01:00:54.233 --> 01:01:13.832]  Here at WEF I believe we're discussing, there's a lot of discussion about what the new world order will be or how, even in the context of our new Helsinki, how do we work towards that new normative international order that allows us to address our differences and disputes as the civilized world.
[01:01:15.774 --> 01:01:27.501]  I believe perhaps we are at the moment in such a hyper-partisan, hyper-polarized time that we're not going to be able to form that new Helsinki today.
[01:01:27.981 --> 01:01:39.108]  But I hope going forward we are able to do, I mean we must, we must form and improve our normative and international, institutional order internationally so that we can address these complaints.
[01:01:39.528 --> 01:01:48.846]   I hope this time around, once we're building this new world order or new rules-based order, The voice of the Global South and the developing world is included.
[01:01:49.952 --> 01:01:55.737]  That they control, they own, that they're using as a weapon while they cut their resources off and then offer them to flood us.
[01:01:55.857 --> 01:01:58.840]  I mean, this is just their own admitted diabolical plan.
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:11.451]  So John Kerry got confronted, not just Klaus Schwab, not just Albert Bourla of Pfizer, and it's like a 15-minute clip, the full thing's on Infowars.com by the great folks at Rebel News.
[01:02:12.172 --> 01:02:15.735]  And then they also confronted Greta Thunberg.
[01:02:16.752 --> 01:02:21.894]  So let's go ahead and play the short John Kerry clip, and then we'll play some of the longer Greta Thunberg clip.
[01:02:24.174 --> 01:02:34.097]  Secretary Kerry, do you think that the high price of natural gas is actually a helpful thing to get people to transition to a green economy?
[01:02:34.578 --> 01:02:37.518]  I'd love to talk about it, but I just can't do it on the ride.
[01:02:37.558 --> 01:02:41.360]  How can you justify being here when you yourself take private jets?
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:42.080]  Can you answer that?
[01:02:43.311 --> 01:02:48.982]  But you've taken a private jet before... No, but you've taken a private jet before to collect a climate change award.
[01:02:49.002 --> 01:02:49.764]  You have done that.
[01:02:49.964 --> 01:02:51.127]  I fly commercially.
[01:02:51.227 --> 01:02:51.968]  Exclusively.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.121]  Yeah, let's go to the credit a minute.
[01:02:57.161 --> 01:03:02.182]  I told you to play both, but I want to... John Kerry's been caught in this lie six or seven times, I remember.
[01:03:02.202 --> 01:03:02.802]  You can look it up.
[01:03:03.202 --> 01:03:06.143]  He's got a big, huge, white and green jet.
[01:03:07.203 --> 01:03:09.403]  I think this is like a $40 million jet.
[01:03:09.423 --> 01:03:10.223]  I forget the exact type.
[01:03:10.243 --> 01:03:11.264]  You can look up John Kerry's jet.
[01:03:11.504 --> 01:03:12.924]  That guy's Googled John Kerry's jet.
[01:03:13.284 --> 01:03:14.144]  He owns a jet.
[01:03:15.165 --> 01:03:16.765]  He's been caught flying around everywhere on it.
[01:03:18.894 --> 01:03:22.257]  And he uses a foundation he's got to pay for it, so it's tax-free, basically.
[01:03:22.277 --> 01:03:26.260]  He's got a 501c3 or whatever charity he's got, but it's a charity.
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:27.761]  He flies everywhere on it.
[01:03:28.101 --> 01:03:32.384]  He's done a photo op on a jet one time of a commercial jet not wearing a mask.
[01:03:33.525 --> 01:03:35.086]  And he always tells the same lies.
[01:03:35.386 --> 01:03:37.508]  I fly commercial exclusively.
[01:03:38.889 --> 01:03:42.732]  Because all over the world, they're banning domestic flights saying planes are bad for the Earth.
[01:03:43.612 --> 01:03:45.494]  So again, these people are lying frauds.
[01:03:45.534 --> 01:03:45.854]  There it is.
[01:03:45.894 --> 01:03:46.515]  See, my memory's right.
[01:03:46.995 --> 01:03:48.036]  Green and white jet.
[01:03:50.464 --> 01:03:55.971]  So, he's got a Gulfstream G4 private jet, tail number N57HJ.
[01:03:56.312 --> 01:04:01.278]  By the way, they got sites online in aviation, you can look about where that jet's been going.
[01:04:01.659 --> 01:04:03.882]  Last time I checked, months ago, it's flying all over the place.
[01:04:04.743 --> 01:04:07.627]  But he flies exclusively.
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:09.300]  Commercial.
[01:04:10.201 --> 01:04:13.642]  And Greta Thunberg was arrested by German police last week, but it was all staged.
[01:04:14.023 --> 01:04:15.783]  And the video came out that it was a director.
[01:04:16.264 --> 01:04:17.304]  Literally with a film crew.
[01:04:17.324 --> 01:04:17.924]  It was all fake.
[01:04:18.165 --> 01:04:19.625]  But the media still says it's real.
[01:04:19.945 --> 01:04:22.567]  Because he's just hoping enough of you believe his lie.
[01:04:22.987 --> 01:04:25.288]  And they use that same tactic over and over again.
[01:04:25.648 --> 01:04:27.149]  Here is some of Greta Thunberg.
[01:04:27.657 --> 01:04:30.698]  We can catch a minute of the young lady's time.
[01:04:31.178 --> 01:04:35.278]  Greta, how many times did you rehearse your arrest at the German coal mine?
[01:04:35.899 --> 01:04:37.339]  How many times did you rehearse it?
[01:04:37.399 --> 01:04:38.599]  Because it looks staged.
[01:04:39.159 --> 01:04:39.759]  Is it true?
[01:04:40.479 --> 01:04:42.760]  How many times did you rehearse your arrest?
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:47.461]  Greta, how many times did you film your arrest?
[01:04:47.521 --> 01:04:49.181]  And why was it staged that way?
[01:04:49.901 --> 01:04:54.222]  Greta, considering you've not spent much time in school, how do you know so much about climate change?
[01:04:56.001 --> 01:04:57.703]  Greta, maybe you want to talk to a real journalist.
[01:04:58.463 --> 01:04:59.164]  What did you talk to?
[01:04:59.204 --> 01:05:00.565]  You're a Darwinist.
[01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:01.906]  Was it successful?
[01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:09.674]  Greta, as a real journalist, is climate change as real as your arrest?
[01:05:11.916 --> 01:05:13.797]  Greta, how far are you willing to go?
[01:05:14.198 --> 01:05:15.559]  You're willing to break the law.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.101]  Will you renounce violence?
[01:05:18.922 --> 01:05:20.564]  Will you renounce violence, Greta?
[01:05:21.596 --> 01:05:22.997]  Or do you support Antifa?
[01:05:23.017 --> 01:05:24.698]  You've worn an Antifa shirt before.
[01:05:25.198 --> 01:05:26.739]  Are you in favor of Antifa?
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.501]  Greta, how did you get here today?
[01:05:29.521 --> 01:05:31.182]  What was your climate footprint in traveling here?
[01:05:35.365 --> 01:05:42.370]  What's your plan while you're here, Greta?
[01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:43.270]  Uh... Five.
[01:05:43.310 --> 01:05:43.890]  Five?
[01:05:44.811 --> 01:05:47.553]  Will we have a Friday for Future demo tomorrow here?
[01:05:49.423 --> 01:05:56.530]  Greta, how do you feel about discussing climate change with the delegates here when nearly all of them take private jets?
[01:05:57.851 --> 01:06:02.175]  Do you think at least the fact these delegates take private jets is a bad thing against, you know, what you believe in?
[01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:14.603]  All of this could be done via Zoom, so surely, surely you should be encouraging all the delegates here, especially the likes of US Special Envoy John Kerry for climate, er, Special Envoy for Climate Change.
[01:06:15.163 --> 01:06:21.545]  Surely you should be saying to these people, you should be doing this via Zoom, with a much smaller carbon footprint, surely?
[01:06:25.925 --> 01:06:28.626]  Greta, avoid my questions if climate change is a con.
[01:06:30.606 --> 01:06:31.667]  Greta, what do you think about this one?
[01:06:31.907 --> 01:06:33.207]  Well, I think that says enough.
[01:06:34.938 --> 01:06:38.161]  Greta, energy prices in Europe have never been higher.
[01:06:38.722 --> 01:06:41.044]  Is this a good thing or a bad thing?
[01:06:43.747 --> 01:06:48.031]  Are you happy that natural gas is so expensive, so people can't afford it?
[01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:49.393]  Or do you think that's bad?
[01:06:52.616 --> 01:06:54.458]  Greta, it's getting quite cold in Davos.
[01:06:54.498 --> 01:06:56.199]  When can I expect some global warming?
[01:06:56.219 --> 01:06:57.761]  I don't know.
[01:07:00.562 --> 01:07:01.824]  Look, she just laughs at you.
[01:07:01.864 --> 01:07:03.906]  They never respond because they're robots.
[01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:06.469]  They have a script they follow.
[01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:08.632]  It's what they do and they never stop.
[01:07:09.433 --> 01:07:10.013]  All right, folks.
[01:07:10.073 --> 01:07:11.155]  We'll be right back.
[01:07:11.215 --> 01:07:13.077]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:07:13.457 --> 01:07:17.822]  Band up video conspiracy fact on info so you can share the uncensored link.
[01:07:17.882 --> 01:07:18.563]  We'll be right back.
[01:07:18.583 --> 01:07:18.984]  Stay with us.
[01:07:20.088 --> 01:07:21.889]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight.
[01:07:21.909 --> 01:07:29.490]  So if you've been paying attention for the past five or six years, and we know you have been, you've probably noticed the inverted nature of modern language.
[01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:33.111]  Pretty much everything is precisely the opposite of what they claim it is.
[01:07:33.871 --> 01:07:39.333]  So the people who tell you they're defending democracy are promoting authoritarianism, which is not democracy.
[01:07:39.793 --> 01:07:43.194]  Then the Black Lives Matter movement winds up killing black people.
[01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:44.574]  Who would have seen that coming?
[01:07:45.094 --> 01:07:47.895]  Then our public health authorities make the population sicker.
[01:07:48.955 --> 01:07:56.303]  And, and this is our new favorite, the so-called World Economic Forum seems to exist to destroy national economies.
[01:07:57.324 --> 01:08:03.651]  Not an overstatement, it was the WEF, keep in mind, that told the government of Sri Lanka to give up modern fertilizer.
[01:08:03.751 --> 01:08:04.973]  Oh, good plan guys!
[01:08:05.013 --> 01:08:05.794]  Go ahead and try it.
[01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:07.110]  Result?
[01:08:07.331 --> 01:08:09.172]  The country collapsed and people starved.
[01:08:09.993 --> 01:08:16.078]  Then it was the WEF that promoted Sam Bankman-Fried's historic Ponzi, the biggest financial fraud in history.
[01:08:16.998 --> 01:08:28.308]  Apparently the savants at the World Economic Forum just couldn't tell that this twitchy, pill-popping kid in cargo shorts, who literally played video games during interviews, was an utterly transparent scammer.
[01:08:28.328 --> 01:08:29.408]  They had no idea!
[01:08:30.369 --> 01:08:32.111]  They thought he was a genius, just like them!
[01:08:33.433 --> 01:08:43.625]  And of course it was the WEF that predicted the COVID lockdowns would, quote, quietly improve cities, not turn them into ominous hellscapes of unemployment, drug addiction, and crime.
[01:08:44.346 --> 01:08:45.827]  It seemed like a good plan at the time.
[01:08:45.847 --> 01:08:46.808]  Hey, I've got an idea.
[01:08:47.209 --> 01:08:49.171]  Let's prevent people from working.
[01:08:49.672 --> 01:08:50.593]  That'll make them rich.
[01:08:50.773 --> 01:08:53.056]  It'll quietly improve life for everyone.
[01:08:54.244 --> 01:08:55.725]  That's the World Economic Forum for you.
[01:08:56.786 --> 01:09:02.512]  The WEF is often described as a group of super villains, but they're also hilariously idiotic.
[01:09:02.772 --> 01:09:04.453]  Not just evil, buffoonish.
[01:09:05.512 --> 01:09:06.673]  And by the way, they know it.
[01:09:06.713 --> 01:09:08.494]  They're smart enough to be embarrassed anyway.
[01:09:09.074 --> 01:09:12.217]  The WEF has since deleted its tweet about COVID lockdowns.
[01:09:12.357 --> 01:09:16.179]  It has memory hold its promotion of scammer Sam Bankman-Fried.
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:23.904]  It has conveniently forgotten all about its guidance on Sri Lankan fertilizer, on which it turns out the WEF is not an expert.
[01:09:23.944 --> 01:09:24.845]  None of that ever happened.
[01:09:25.465 --> 01:09:26.366]  The slate is clean.
[01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:33.291]  So we're ready for yet another World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, which is underway right now.
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:42.143]  The event kicked off this week with 84-year-old Klaus Schwab, he's the founder of the WEF, promising to, quote, master the future.
[01:09:44.324 --> 01:09:47.165]  We couldn't meet at a more challenging time.
[01:09:48.546 --> 01:09:53.968]  We are confronted with so many crises simultaneously.
[01:09:55.629 --> 01:09:58.290]  What does it need to master the future?
[01:09:59.631 --> 01:10:08.435]   I think to have a platform We're all stakeholders of global society are engaged.
[01:10:10.356 --> 01:10:11.797]  We must master the future.
[01:10:12.418 --> 01:10:13.178]  Master the future.
[01:10:14.319 --> 01:10:19.342]  So mastering the future is now the top item on the to-do list at the World Economic Forum this year.
[01:10:20.003 --> 01:10:22.684]  That's the first clue these people are not living the same life you are.
[01:10:22.965 --> 01:10:27.828]  By the end of this week you hope to find some time to get an oil change or maybe pick up some dandruff shampoo at Rite Aid.
[01:10:28.607 --> 01:10:31.389]  At the World Economic Forum, they plan to master the future.
[01:10:31.949 --> 01:10:32.749]  That's the kind of people they are.
[01:10:32.769 --> 01:10:34.110]  How are they going to do it, by the way?
[01:10:34.210 --> 01:10:36.291]  Well, they're going to do it with John Kerry!
[01:10:37.031 --> 01:10:39.353]  Who, despite physical appearances, is still alive!
[01:10:40.233 --> 01:10:45.656]  Kerry will be 80 years old this year, so it goes without saying that if he's going to master the future, he'd better hurry.
[01:10:46.516 --> 01:10:47.517]  Thankfully, he's got a plan.
[01:10:47.837 --> 01:10:48.097]  Watch.
[01:10:49.098 --> 01:11:06.690]   It's pretty extraordinary that we, a select group of human beings, Because of whatever touched us at some point in our lives, we're able to sit in a room and come together and actually talk about saving the planet.
[01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:12.993]  I mean, it's so almost extraterrestrial to think about, quote, saving the planet.
[01:11:13.013 --> 01:11:22.457]  And if you said that to most people, most people, they think you're just a crazy tree-hugging, lefty, liberal, you know, do-gooder or whatever, and there's no relationship.
[01:11:22.477 --> 01:11:24.098]  But really, that's where we are.
[01:11:25.762 --> 01:11:36.111]  So, most people don't understand, but we are a select group of human beings, John Kerry tells the attendees of the World Economic Forum, who honestly did not need to be reminded of that.
[01:11:36.652 --> 01:11:47.601]  People may say we're crazy tree-huggin' liberal do-gooders, but we know the truth, which is that actually, we're soulless greed-head money-worshippers, who'd sell our own children to China for a big enough tax credit.
[01:11:47.821 --> 01:11:49.663]  Shout out to you, Larry Fink in the third row.
[01:11:49.943 --> 01:11:50.804]  Catch you at the Suchu Bar.
[01:11:52.006 --> 01:11:57.010]  That was John Kerry's message at the World Economic Forum, which is also effectively the WEF's credo.
[01:11:57.771 --> 01:11:59.432]  But then John Kerry went further.
[01:11:59.993 --> 01:12:05.918]  What we're doing today, he said, in saving the planet is almost, quote, extraterrestrial.
[01:12:05.938 --> 01:12:11.262]  In other words, if you ever suspected these people are freaking aliens, it turns out you're right.
[01:12:11.843 --> 01:12:12.243]  They are.
[01:12:13.064 --> 01:12:16.227]  And as if to prove it, Al Gore himself showed up!
[01:12:17.458 --> 01:12:23.564]  At 74 years old, Al Gore is as awkward, synthetic, and weird as he has ever been since 8th grade to now.
[01:12:24.284 --> 01:12:27.107]  Though at this point, he's much, much richer thanks to Google stock.
[01:12:27.948 --> 01:12:31.051]  Ever notice how the richer people get, the more they seem like Bill Gates?
[01:12:31.852 --> 01:12:33.193]  It's not your imagination.
[01:12:33.693 --> 01:12:35.595]  Al Gore single-handedly proves that theory.
[01:12:35.635 --> 01:12:36.316]  Here he was today.
[01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:43.852]  Look at the xenophobia and political authoritarian trends that have come from just a few million refugees.
[01:12:43.993 --> 01:12:44.873]  What about a billion?
[01:12:45.113 --> 01:12:48.654]  We would lose our capacity for self-governance on this world.
[01:12:49.254 --> 01:12:50.735]  We have to act!
[01:12:55.117 --> 01:12:55.997]  Always angry!
[01:12:56.077 --> 01:12:57.037]  Always shouting!
[01:12:58.638 --> 01:12:59.838]  Fatter but still grumpy!
[01:13:01.139 --> 01:13:04.220]  They're climate refugees now!
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:05.521]  They're climate refugees!
[01:13:05.561 --> 01:13:06.141]  Millions of them!
[01:13:06.803 --> 01:13:12.446]  They're not economic migrants fleeing the squalor of Tegucigalpa for the generous social services of El Paso.
[01:13:12.526 --> 01:13:13.087]  No, they're not.
[01:13:13.447 --> 01:13:21.611]  They're climate refugees who have no choice but to risk their lives with coyotes because you drive a full-size Silverado.
[01:13:21.952 --> 01:13:24.453]  Illegal immigration is your fault, Middle America.
[01:13:24.473 --> 01:13:25.113]  It's not our fault.
[01:13:25.133 --> 01:13:26.114]  We got nothing to do with it.
[01:13:26.194 --> 01:13:27.094]  We just run the world.
[01:13:28.975 --> 01:13:40.789]   If this is all starting to sound like a bad CNN segment to you, a parade of self-confident dumb people, Rich in self-esteem, low in wisdom, giving moralizing lectures to one another's applause.
[01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:43.531]  Well, let us confirm that for you.
[01:13:43.551 --> 01:13:44.532]  Where was Don Lamond?
[01:13:44.612 --> 01:13:45.572]  Why wasn't he there?
[01:13:46.813 --> 01:13:47.474]  Well, he wasn't.
[01:13:48.014 --> 01:13:49.475]  That's a next year's program, no doubt.
[01:13:49.996 --> 01:13:57.521]  This year, we're not making this up, America's favorite unemployed media critic, Mr. Brian Stelter, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:57.802 --> 01:13:58.022]  Watch.
[01:13:59.199 --> 01:14:04.582]  The clear and present danger of disinformation is our conversation here this afternoon.
[01:14:05.002 --> 01:14:10.064]  It follows a session just now about disrupting distrust, and of course those are connected, so I hope that's where we can start.
[01:14:10.624 --> 01:14:13.686]  I'm Brian Seltzer, formerly of CNN, now a fellow at Harvard University.
[01:14:13.706 --> 01:14:15.247]  A reminder that the hashtag is WEF23.
[01:14:15.307 --> 01:14:20.729]  We can try to put some real information out into the world to make up for all the crazy.
[01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:23.771]  Make up for all the crazy!
[01:14:24.861 --> 01:14:36.927]  The conclusion this year at the World Economic Forum is that people who are not at the World Economic Forum have too much free speech, too many bad ideas, too much crazy, and too much opportunity to talk.
[01:14:37.367 --> 01:14:38.608]  They're still talking out there!
[01:14:38.868 --> 01:14:40.669]  Stop them before they talk some more!
[01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:52.138]  So if you're getting the impression that the world's most mediocre people and least self-aware people are all congregating in Switzerland this week, you are on to something.
[01:14:52.178 --> 01:15:00.506]  In fact, it might be worth getting an attendee list just to make certain that not a single person who is there this week ever has power over you in any way.
[01:15:01.166 --> 01:15:06.070]  If one of these people shows up supervising the bake sale at your kid's school, call the police.
[01:15:06.471 --> 01:15:07.411]  They're not qualified.
[01:15:08.132 --> 01:15:11.834]  So with that in mind, it was interesting to see Florida Congresswoman Maria Salazar there.
[01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:19.579]  Maria Salazar hasn't been in Congress very long, but she has spent her time laser-focused on helping foreign nationals come to this country illegally.
[01:15:19.819 --> 01:15:20.639]  Her own constituents?
[01:15:20.719 --> 01:15:21.380]  No concern.
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.661]  People in other countries coming here to go on welfare?
[01:15:23.941 --> 01:15:24.582]  Oh yeah!
[01:15:25.612 --> 01:15:38.973]  Before Maria Salazar was even inaugurated, she posted a video on Twitter promising Nicaraguans and Hondurans in Central America that she would, quote, be there for them, to, quote, help and assist, end quote, everything the American government can do for them!
[01:15:40.097 --> 01:15:46.721]  Not what they might do for our country as new immigrants, how they might build the country, make it better, unite it, make it more prosperous, peaceful.
[01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:47.701]  No.
[01:15:48.382 --> 01:15:57.367]  What the American government can do for people the American government owes nothing to who are breaking laws the American government passed.
[01:15:58.479 --> 01:15:59.280]  That's Maria Salazar.
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:09.646]  She's in Davos this week, of course, and during her time in Davos, it goes without saying, she demanded amnesty for tens of millions of foreign nationals living in our country illegally.
[01:16:09.846 --> 01:16:10.086]  Watch.
[01:16:10.786 --> 01:16:16.770]  We need to also give dignity to those people who are in the country, and those are the people that I represent.
[01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:26.256]  We're talking about 13, 15 million people who are, most of them Hispanics, I would say 85%, who speak my language, look like me, and sound like me.
[01:16:26.536 --> 01:16:31.096]   that are contributing with the economy of this country and they live in the shadows.
[01:16:31.096 --> 01:16:36.454]   So it's time to seal the border, like she said, put order, let's see who comes in and who doesn't,
[01:16:36.454 --> 01:16:40.135]   and then turn around and give dignity. That doesn't mean path to citizenship,
[01:16:40.135 --> 01:16:45.414]   that means to include them and make them dignified members of our community.
[01:16:46.855 --> 01:16:58.935]   These people who look like me, don't you love it when white people.
[01:16:58.935 --> 01:17:03.255]  Here's what you can expect at Davos this year.
[01:17:03.402 --> 01:17:08.804]  Where our unelected overlord, Klaus Schwab, asks this very important question.
[01:17:08.984 --> 01:17:11.585]  What does it need to master the future?
[01:17:12.085 --> 01:17:16.907]  This year's annual meeting takes place amid a global cost-of-living crisis.
[01:17:17.528 --> 01:17:20.589]  And during Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.
[01:17:21.687 --> 01:17:38.514]  By bringing the planet's politicians, business and civil leaders together in the same building, the meeting offers a key opportunity, like the clear and present danger of disinformation panel discussion, led by former CNN Arbiter of Truth, Brian Stelter.
[01:17:39.074 --> 01:17:41.395]  I leave CNN and I was arrested by military police.
[01:17:41.815 --> 01:17:46.156]  Brian recently had a run-in with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:17:46.576 --> 01:17:49.497]  Here's how it went down.
[01:17:49.817 --> 01:17:51.217]  There's nothing you can do!
[01:17:51.497 --> 01:17:53.038]  We're gonna rape your body!
[01:17:53.058 --> 01:17:54.478]  Rape your medical rights!
[01:17:54.558 --> 01:17:55.918]  Rape your children's minds!
[01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:57.719]  We're gonna ship Satan to land!
[01:17:57.819 --> 01:17:59.379]  We're gonna destroy every facet!
[01:17:59.419 --> 01:18:00.659]  Everyone rules!
[01:18:05.385 --> 01:18:09.887]  Economic growth increasingly depends on building a green global economy.
[01:18:10.387 --> 01:18:16.209]  At Davos, the First Movers Coalition will convene to discuss progress towards this goal.
[01:18:16.509 --> 01:18:28.474]  It's a group of 65 companies working to decarbonize the sectors responsible for 30% of global emissions, including heavy industry and long-distance transport.
[01:18:29.074 --> 01:18:31.075]  To follow the annual meeting 2023, visit our website.
[01:18:33.376 --> 01:18:39.155]   Working towards a safe and secure society. I'm the tyrannical lip
[01:18:57.496 --> 01:19:03.005]   All the time when I'm researching information I see just incredibly important things come out that don't get a lot
[01:19:03.005 --> 01:19:10.139]   of attention But then later, six months, a year, two years later, five years later, sometimes 40 years later, they explode.
[01:19:11.207 --> 01:19:17.331]  And that's what's happened with Dr. Andrew G. Huff, former EcoHealth Alliance Vice President and Senior Scientist.
[01:19:17.371 --> 01:19:22.634]  He's got the new best-selling book by Skyhorse, The Truth About Wuhan, How I Uncovered the Biggest Lie in History.
[01:19:23.034 --> 01:19:23.754]  He's been on with us.
[01:19:24.775 --> 01:19:25.755]  Very important interview.
[01:19:26.376 --> 01:19:32.499]  And I remember that some of the lawyers we're interviewing that have done a great job exposing this tyranny saying, we got a big whistleblower a couple years ago.
[01:19:32.519 --> 01:19:36.942]  And I remember hearing about whistleblowers trying to educate Congress, but it being suppressed.
[01:19:37.862 --> 01:19:43.427]  And then the last year or so, we've seen him be able to emerge with what he witnessed and what he saw.
[01:19:43.467 --> 01:19:48.451]  And we're going to cover all that in the next hour that's coming up.
[01:19:49.331 --> 01:19:53.795]  And you can find Dr. Andrew Huff at AG Huff on Twitter.
[01:19:54.255 --> 01:20:00.721]  But again, the book is The Truth About Wuhan from the same publishers that put out my number one bestseller, The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:20:01.806 --> 01:20:05.892]  I know folks, most of the regular listeners, you know a lot of this stuff.
[01:20:06.714 --> 01:20:11.241]  Some of you know stuff I don't know, but the general public is really ready to hear the truth now.
[01:20:11.261 --> 01:20:13.665]  And a book like this just knocks you out of the park.
[01:20:13.705 --> 01:20:15.047]  And he went through a lot of harassment.
[01:20:16.055 --> 01:20:17.857]  A lot of attacks to bring us this information.
[01:20:17.897 --> 01:20:19.198]  We really appreciate him joining us.
[01:20:19.238 --> 01:20:36.316]  We're going to get into the history of gain-of-function, EcoHealth Alliance, the real COVID timeline, the relationship between mRNA jabs and the gain-of-function research, why we do gain-of-function work, and the relationship to biodefense and biowarfare, and Fauci lying to Congress and saying he doesn't do something that he has programs named gain-of-function.
[01:20:37.297 --> 01:20:55.569]  The Ties Between Intelligence Community and EcoHealth Alliance, EcoHealth Alliance, Ties to Global Organizations, WEF, Economic Global Finance, Ties to Pandemic Prediction, mRNA Vaccines, and how they're trying to roll out all these new ones right now, Fifth Generation Warfare and COVID Narratives, where they admit they're using intelligence agencies to use weaponized propaganda against us.
[01:20:55.609 --> 01:20:56.530]  That's now out in the open.
[01:20:56.810 --> 01:21:00.413]  The Twitter files have really, really exposed that and woken a lot of people up.
[01:21:00.913 --> 01:21:02.754]  So Dr. Huff, good to have you here with us.
[01:21:02.774 --> 01:21:03.715]  Great job with the book.
[01:21:04.095 --> 01:21:11.238]   I wanted to spend time in this first segment at the end of this hour with who you are, just a basic bio for a few minutes,
[01:21:11.238 --> 01:21:16.597]   and then what this process of you being on the inside, coming out of it, and exposing it,
[01:21:16.597 --> 01:21:22.717]   and now just, now that you're really up to speed as a smart guy, I respect what you would describe
[01:21:22.717 --> 01:21:25.157]   the world like currently, and who you think the main players are.
[01:21:25.157 --> 01:21:26.118]  Thanks for being here.
[01:21:26.118 --> 01:21:27.997]  Thank you so much for having me, Alex.
[01:21:27.997 --> 01:21:30.516]   So just brief the public out there a little bit about yourself,
[01:21:30.516 --> 01:21:35.038]   and just what you think, just as a citizen, as a father, as a husband,
[01:21:35.038 --> 01:21:36.757]  about where the world is right now.
[01:21:36.696 --> 01:21:38.737]  Well, the world is in a really strange place.
[01:21:39.057 --> 01:21:40.558]  My background is unique as a scientist.
[01:21:40.958 --> 01:21:50.382]  I started off my career in the military, served as an infantryman in the Minnesota Army National Guard, and it was combat deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.
[01:21:51.022 --> 01:21:52.743]  Coming out of that, I decided I wanted to be a scientist.
[01:21:53.463 --> 01:21:57.246]  I have degrees in psychology, security technology, and a Ph.D.
[01:21:57.366 --> 01:21:59.267]  in emerging infectious disease epidemiology.
[01:22:00.127 --> 01:22:05.890]  Coming out of those programs, I was groomed to be a Dr. Anthony Fauci type of national security.
[01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:07.491]  So while I was completing my Ph.D.
[01:22:08.472 --> 01:22:13.634]  at the University of Minnesota, I actually worked at a research center of excellence for the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:22:13.674 --> 01:22:15.435]  I received a full scholarship.
[01:22:16.156 --> 01:22:17.376]  I was paid a high salary.
[01:22:17.396 --> 01:22:19.658]  I was actually a research fellow at the university.
[01:22:20.578 --> 01:22:27.024]  So during my PhD, I began spending about a week on average per year out in Washington, D.C.
[01:22:27.044 --> 01:22:32.049]  being taught the ropes of how to get the money, being introduced to the right key players, and presenting my research.
[01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:49.182]   From there, I actually worked at Sandia National Laboratories as a senior member of the technical staff, where I worked on classified programs in pandemic preparedness, biowarfare, bioterrorism, and another bunch of aspects of Of course.
[01:22:49.522 --> 01:22:52.323]  So what do I think is going on in this crazy world right now?
[01:22:52.943 --> 01:23:08.488]  I think we're in a critical turning point in human history where we've actually changed the narrative effectively with my book and a number of the other people like Alex have been fighting this battle.
[01:23:10.529 --> 01:23:11.389]  Great boil down.
[01:23:12.935 --> 01:23:25.063]  Your view, just as a father or husband, of where America is, I'm sure you've been following Davos, world government, you're going to eat bugs, we're going to run your life, we've got to censor and shut down Americans, but we're not evil.
[01:23:25.083 --> 01:23:29.526]  I mean, they're just up there cartoonishly evil and then saying they're not evil.
[01:23:30.595 --> 01:23:32.536]  Well, over my dead body is what I say.
[01:23:32.556 --> 01:23:42.159]  And I've actually had to defend myself physically on my property against the government, their contractors, and the Michigan State Police to maintain our way of life.
[01:23:42.739 --> 01:23:43.979]  They want to take away our property.
[01:23:43.999 --> 01:23:45.780]  They want us to eat bugs.
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.541]  They want us to have nothing.
[01:23:48.941 --> 01:24:01.969]  And it's a slippery slope through this COVID policy where they're taking away our civil liberties and actually pushing medical fascism towards us to restrict our liberties and pump crap into our bodies which will kill us.
[01:24:02.549 --> 01:24:02.990]  Well, that's right.
[01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.971]  That's the wedge.
[01:24:04.051 --> 01:24:07.795]  And it's not just your opinion from an insider who woke up and went public.
[01:24:07.815 --> 01:24:09.056]  People are just like, oh, he's an insider.
[01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:09.597]  We can't listen to him.
[01:24:10.038 --> 01:24:17.106]  No, we better be ready for insiders to tour in their compartmentalized or good people who then get decompartmentalized.
[01:24:17.546 --> 01:24:28.171]  But the Davos Group, the UN, they admit, well, Xi Jinping developed this, and it's the world model for a medical ID, and it's going to be the model for the carbon tax, and the model for the social credit score, and the model for universal basic income.
[01:24:28.531 --> 01:24:43.659]   And then it was two years ago, certified by the UN as the world standard, and they admit, in Davos clips I've got from yesterday, with Tony Blair, the former Prime Minister of England, saying, we've got to get the digital ID in for our whole program to take over, and get our Central Bank Digital Currency.
[01:24:43.719 --> 01:24:45.061]  So we know they're Holy Grail.
[01:24:45.481 --> 01:24:47.903]  Thank God DeSantis is saying he's blocking it, he gets it.
[01:24:48.384 --> 01:24:53.909]  But as soon as the public gets educated about this new takeover, it's going to fail because it's so draconian, so evil.
[01:24:54.590 --> 01:25:02.538]  But like speaking directly to that, watching this whole control grid come into place, what's your view on that?
[01:25:03.413 --> 01:25:05.335]  Well, it all starts with the surveillance state.
[01:25:05.375 --> 01:25:11.220]  So what they're trying to do right now is they want to have access to all the information and metadata that's happening.
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:13.362]  Something you didn't classify but can't talk about.
[01:25:14.603 --> 01:25:16.605]  Well, I can get into it.
[01:25:17.126 --> 01:25:18.767]  Your work was in surveillance.
[01:25:20.669 --> 01:25:27.691]  Well, so I actually developed advanced surveillance technologies for signals intelligence.
[01:25:27.711 --> 01:25:31.993]  So signals intelligence is basically the digital signature that comes off things like mobile devices.
[01:25:32.293 --> 01:25:35.994]  It could be a digitally communicated result from a laboratory.
[01:25:36.314 --> 01:25:36.774]  Well, the U.S.
[01:25:36.794 --> 01:25:42.136]  government has access to what's called the pipeline, and that's all the information being sent around the planet.
[01:25:43.476 --> 01:25:54.585]  I can say that these systems exist and we're actually developing artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to actually put this all together so you can have highly predictive forecasts of how people will behave or where things are emerging.
[01:25:54.965 --> 01:26:00.530]  And this is, to actually accomplish that goal, they want to digitize everything in your life.
[01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:06.715]  They want to have an IoT device in your house, like a refrigerator, an oven, your smartwatch, your phone.
[01:26:06.735 --> 01:26:09.777]  If you notice, they're pushing this connectivity and they're actually hiding it devices.
[01:26:12.039 --> 01:26:12.620]  For example, here.
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:17.802]  So say that you go buy a device at a store and it's not labeled as having Wi-Fi connectivity.
[01:26:18.062 --> 01:26:20.783]  It might actually have the circuitry in it to have Wi-Fi.
[01:26:21.204 --> 01:26:24.705]  And then what they can do is they can actually activate that after you purchase it.
[01:26:25.145 --> 01:26:33.969]  And by doing that, they're going to be able to collect information then to pattern you and then eventually to take control of your whole life.
[01:26:34.269 --> 01:26:43.994]   Because interfacing with everything else, an example is, a lot of these even $10-$15 children's toys Turns out they have cameras on them and sensors, and they're grabbing all the data.
[01:26:44.955 --> 01:26:45.475]  It's incredible.
[01:26:46.435 --> 01:26:47.056]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:26:47.376 --> 01:26:51.638]  And with that information, you have to ask the question, well, what are they doing with that information?
[01:26:51.698 --> 01:26:53.519]  What do they care about what your kids are doing?
[01:26:53.879 --> 01:27:03.244]  Well, once they are able to profile you as an individual, they can start to determine how to nudge you with different psychological operations.
[01:27:03.644 --> 01:27:09.487]  What kind of information should we present to this person to change or nudge their behavior in a certain direction?
[01:27:10.227 --> 01:27:13.268]  And that's really what fifth-generation warfare is all about.
[01:27:13.708 --> 01:27:18.531]  If they can figure out what motivates you, what drives you... Tailored targeting.
[01:27:18.730 --> 01:27:25.371]   Correct. And highly, not just tailored, but individual level. So to your household, to
[01:27:25.371 --> 01:27:29.530]   your neighborhood, to your community. And that makes their marketing strategy or their
[01:27:29.530 --> 01:27:33.190]   communication strategy much more effective and efficient because you have to realize
[01:27:33.190 --> 01:27:39.670]   that the people that are pushing this fifth generation warfare are also resource limited.
[01:27:39.670 --> 01:27:42.730]   So to optimize it, they have to figure out where they're going to get the most bang for
[01:27:43.589 --> 01:27:53.857]  So, the other part of this, too, is that once they have it figured out, you know, where they're going to get the most bang for the buck, then they can drive wedges into communities and put people against each other.
[01:27:54.157 --> 01:27:55.178]  And COVID is that wedge?
[01:27:55.879 --> 01:27:56.539]  Well, it's one of them.
[01:27:56.839 --> 01:27:58.120]  Well, probably the biggest one in human history.
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:27:58.681]  Race baiting.
[01:27:59.161 --> 01:28:00.022]  Yeah.
[01:28:00.522 --> 01:28:01.443]  What are some of the other wedges?
[01:28:02.123 --> 01:28:12.509]   Well, some of the other wedges going on right now, I guess, with Well, I have to say, I think COVID vaccines are probably a big wedge.
[01:28:12.529 --> 01:28:26.825]  So actually, the way that they're pushing medical information and technology onto people, and then actually seeding misinformation about the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccine, for example, is a wedge issue.
[01:28:30.282 --> 01:28:32.404]  It doesn't seem like it's going well for them, though.
[01:28:32.444 --> 01:28:37.848]  Despite all their power, all their control, the human intelligence is waking up that it's under attack.
[01:28:38.289 --> 01:28:45.015]  And once a human figures out they're under attack, it seems like this technology is only powerful if you are unconscious and don't know it's there.
[01:28:46.209 --> 01:28:56.913]  Well, so my undergraduate degree in psychology, and it's a fact, so the more aware an individual is of cognitive biases, the less likely that they're going to engage in them.
[01:28:57.394 --> 01:29:07.618]  So part of the Great Awakening and what we're experiencing right now and why there's this pivotal moment happening in human history is everyone's becoming aware of the game and what's being played.
[01:29:09.724 --> 01:29:18.193]  We're going to come right back and talk about that, because when we saw all these articles in the BBC and the Associated Press, oh, all the intelligence agencies help scare you for your own good about COVID.
[01:29:18.633 --> 01:29:22.097]  That's them trying to condition us to accept what they know is already coming out.
[01:29:22.477 --> 01:29:23.198]  Back in two minutes.
[01:29:24.599 --> 01:29:30.385]  We're up here casually talking about earth-shattering information.
[01:29:31.357 --> 01:29:33.038]  A lot of people realize how serious this is.
[01:29:33.998 --> 01:29:41.882]  The truth about Wuhan, how I uncovered the biggest lie in history, Dr. Andrew G. Huff, former EcoHealth Alliance Vice President and Senior Scientist.
[01:29:41.902 --> 01:29:45.163]  And that's the cutout group they were using to launch this whole thing.
[01:29:45.603 --> 01:29:47.124]  We've got the whole rest of the hour to go.
[01:29:47.184 --> 01:29:48.804]  Some stations join us in about six minutes.
[01:29:49.365 --> 01:29:58.869]  But we were getting into all the headlines that came out with, oh yeah, military intelligence, not just here but everywhere else, was brainwashing you and using weaponized info for your own good.
[01:29:59.569 --> 01:30:05.152]  To tell you the shots are safe, to tell you social distancing works, to tell you mask work, to tell you to hate your neighbor.
[01:30:05.613 --> 01:30:09.555]  It's illegal under our laws to use that domestically, but they still did it.
[01:30:10.015 --> 01:30:11.536]  Why would they come out and admit all that?
[01:30:13.097 --> 01:30:15.698]  Well, I think, I think they really have no other choice.
[01:30:15.738 --> 01:30:25.104]  I mean, I think Congress is actually putting, is going to start putting pressure on the intelligence community and the Department of Defense related to the, specifically related to this COVID narrative.
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:27.500]  Absolutely.
[01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:30.622]  So the bureaucracy's gone too far.
[01:30:31.643 --> 01:30:32.303]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:30:32.503 --> 01:30:36.985]  I mean, I think without a doubt that there's not a person in the country right now that doesn't feel that way.
[01:30:37.886 --> 01:30:42.748]  The sad reality is that I don't think that Congress actually has went so far where it's represented that view.
[01:30:42.788 --> 01:30:52.334]  The Uniparty is in full effect, and I'm wondering what the breaking point's going to be until they actually get frustrated and actually start making a stink about this and actually do something about it.
[01:30:53.254 --> 01:30:53.854]  Well, that's it.
[01:30:53.894 --> 01:30:56.175]  Because the Republicans give lip service, they haven't really done much.
[01:30:56.515 --> 01:30:57.555]  No, they haven't done a single thing.
[01:30:57.575 --> 01:31:00.897]  And I've actually been trying to put a lot of heat on the Senate and Congress.
[01:31:00.997 --> 01:31:17.062]  And so, the funny thing is, when I actually went to Senator Ron Johnson and asked him for help related to the harassment from the FBI, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Michigan State Police, there wasn't really an overpouring of support for something so crazy happening in my life.
[01:31:17.602 --> 01:31:20.983]  And I hope that they come around and change as this story starts coming to the mainstream.
[01:31:23.234 --> 01:31:32.499]  If we allow to tolerate that kind of behavior in the United States, these representatives, our elected officials, they need to stand up and protect us and serve us.
[01:31:32.919 --> 01:31:38.022]  Well, I mean, imagine, because it's on record what happened to you, how scared they were, because that's the thing.
[01:31:38.643 --> 01:31:43.605]  People make a big deal, this basketball player dunked a basketball, this football player did this, I scared of that.
[01:31:44.126 --> 01:31:49.829]  You're on record, you were one of the chief scientists, you were the vice president, you gave the info to Congress, you gave it to the lawyers.
[01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:55.275]  I mean, so many of the things that came out about Fauci gain of function and Wu Han, them lying, was you.
[01:31:56.176 --> 01:32:02.384]  Because there's a lot of great doctors out there exposing it who've done a great job, like Malone and McCullough and Dr. Michael Yeadon.
[01:32:02.424 --> 01:32:02.965]  They're amazing.
[01:32:04.127 --> 01:32:10.734]  But you were like the insider, and then the story of what happened to you while you were exposing him is just insane.
[01:32:10.934 --> 01:32:14.518]  Well, and I can't believe that I haven't been called to Congress to testify.
[01:32:14.538 --> 01:32:20.224]  I've actually volunteered to do so to the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Committee on Investigations.
[01:32:21.345 --> 01:32:24.968]  The worst part about this book is I shouldn't have had to write this book.
[01:32:25.328 --> 01:32:26.509]  I wrote this book for two reasons.
[01:32:26.649 --> 01:32:29.031]  One, I wanted to get the truth out, and two, I had to do it to save my life.
[01:32:29.491 --> 01:32:31.132]  I had actually been providing that information.
[01:32:31.173 --> 01:32:41.260]  Everything in the book I actually provided under oath with penalty of perjury to the House Intelligence Committee and the Permanent Select Committee in the Senate on Investigations.
[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:43.461]  And I'd been feeding them that information.
[01:32:43.501 --> 01:32:46.423]  And then they sent special ops on you.
[01:32:47.324 --> 01:32:47.865]  Essentially.
[01:32:50.661 --> 01:32:51.442]  It's almost unbelievable.
[01:32:51.462 --> 01:32:53.405]  If they didn't know your profile, that would just make you mad?
[01:32:53.745 --> 01:33:10.984]   Well, I don't know, but the one thing that's really strange about it, when I was having conversations with investigators from the House Intelligence Committee, I didn't know if the Uniparty was actually working against me and they were actually using that information to cycle it back against me for the attacks and the craziness that they're putting back in my life.
[01:33:11.324 --> 01:33:21.396]  You have to figure, if the federal bureaucracy, the agencies, are going to go engage in this kind of activity towards me, it had to get the nod or the approval from somebody.
[01:33:22.097 --> 01:33:26.161]  And I have a hard time believing that the House Intelligence Committee didn't know what was going on.
[01:33:26.201 --> 01:33:30.706]  Maybe you, maybe... Well, they're all, it's come out in files, they're all surveilled by the CIA.
[01:33:31.126 --> 01:33:32.788]  And they've got operatives in all those positions.
[01:33:32.828 --> 01:33:34.249]  Hell, half of them are Chinese agents.
[01:33:34.830 --> 01:33:37.032]  You're not just dealing with American agents, there's damn things in China.
[01:33:37.252 --> 01:33:42.358]  I mean, look at that whole Hunter Biden house, he rented for $50,000, went from his dad, was a data dumping facility.
[01:33:43.118 --> 01:33:45.719]  And the Chinese funded a whole thing at Penn State for Biden?
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.861]  Well, maybe you can help me make sense of this weirdness.
[01:33:47.901 --> 01:33:49.581]  Hold on, stay there.
[01:33:49.622 --> 01:33:54.984]  Let's talk about this and maybe we should get to the harassment up front and then go back to the beginning when you started questioning.
[01:33:55.004 --> 01:33:56.985]  I'm going to try to give you the floor when we come back.
[01:33:57.145 --> 01:33:57.906]  You've got to watch me.
[01:33:57.926 --> 01:34:02.068]  If you talk to me and pause, I'm going to tell you, I've got diarrhea in the mouth here, buddy.
[01:34:02.488 --> 01:34:05.350]  You're here and you've got information we need, so tell me to shut up.
[01:34:06.150 --> 01:34:08.831]  I'll interrogate your ass and ask more questions than answers.
[01:34:09.111 --> 01:34:09.271]  Good.
[01:34:09.331 --> 01:34:09.631]  All right.
[01:34:09.672 --> 01:34:10.712]  We'll be right back.
[01:34:10.772 --> 01:34:11.892]  Infowars.com.
[01:34:12.233 --> 01:34:13.433]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:34:13.493 --> 01:34:14.013]  Stay with us.
[01:34:15.054 --> 01:34:19.315]  Four words, four little words that are hurting America's pandemic response.
[01:34:19.876 --> 01:34:20.276]  What are they?
[01:34:21.206 --> 01:34:22.046]  Do your own research!
[01:34:22.386 --> 01:34:25.188]  Can we all stop saying, I need to do my own research?
[01:34:25.628 --> 01:34:29.389]  Nobody who's saying that is getting in a lab and doing tests.
[01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:33.031]  At best, you're reading other people's research.
[01:34:33.231 --> 01:34:38.793]  And more likely, you're probably reading a tweet about a headline about a blog post about someone else's research.
[01:34:38.993 --> 01:34:44.575]  That phrase, do your own research, is popping up a lot in conversations about coronavirus and about COVID vaccines.
[01:34:44.775 --> 01:34:49.797]  But this go it alone approach, doing your own research, it seems so innocent, but it can have serious consequences.
[01:34:50.037 --> 01:34:53.620]  In other words, CNN says, don't do your own research.
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:54.861]  What are the roots of this phrase?
[01:34:54.901 --> 01:34:56.923]  I feel like I used to hear it around QAnon craziness.
[01:34:57.103 --> 01:35:04.469]  Well, today, the deer antler guy was sentenced to 41 months in prison for his role in the Capitol riots.
[01:35:07.315 --> 01:35:11.954]   The same phrase through your research is being peddled by some people who do have ill intent,
[01:35:11.954 --> 01:35:17.395]   who want to push you down certain paths, who want to either for profit reasons or for geopolitical
[01:35:17.395 --> 01:35:21.955]   reasons want to make sure that you are reading certain information as opposed to listening
[01:35:21.955 --> 01:35:23.234]  to authoritative sources.
[01:35:23.234 --> 01:35:28.275]  And you will respect my authority!
[01:35:28.275 --> 01:35:32.275]   So what should be an actually smart idea, especially in the U.S.
[01:35:32.472 --> 01:35:38.374]  with such a lack of funding and media literacy and all of these issues, it can really actually help make things worse.
[01:35:38.714 --> 01:35:40.054]  Yeah, it's a sneaky little phrase.
[01:35:40.094 --> 01:35:43.656]  Here's the four words that are helping to spread vaccine misinformation.
[01:35:43.676 --> 01:35:44.116]  Are you ready?
[01:35:44.436 --> 01:35:46.117]  According to CNN, here they are.
[01:35:46.717 --> 01:35:48.377]  Do your own research.
[01:35:51.158 --> 01:35:52.419]  It's a sneaky little phrase.
[01:35:53.533 --> 01:35:54.194]  That's right, folks.
[01:35:54.734 --> 01:35:57.276]  CNN here to tell you, don't look into these things for yourself.
[01:35:57.396 --> 01:35:58.537]  Don't do your own research.
[01:35:58.617 --> 01:35:59.938]  Don't question anything.
[01:36:00.058 --> 01:36:01.420]  Just listen and obey.
[01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:08.585]  He could have undermined the messaging so much that he can actually control exactly what people think.
[01:36:08.806 --> 01:36:10.627]  And that is our job.
[01:36:11.087 --> 01:36:16.592]  Once again, the media is clamoring to tell you to stop looking into stuff for yourself.
[01:36:16.812 --> 01:36:17.853]  Do your own research.
[01:36:17.913 --> 01:36:19.673]  Those four words are hurting the U.S.
[01:36:19.693 --> 01:36:24.516]  pandemic response, CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter said on Reliable Sources Sunday.
[01:36:24.876 --> 01:36:29.058]  Brian Stelter visits school kids to teach them to spot misinformation.
[01:36:29.478 --> 01:36:32.840]  He's telling them don't even trust satire, don't trust anything but CNN.
[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:37.021]  Reducing a liar's reach is not the same as censoring freedom of speech.
[01:36:39.463 --> 01:36:44.245]  And Dr. Andrew G. Huff, the truth about Wuhan, how it uncovered the biggest lie in history.
[01:36:46.650 --> 01:36:52.372]  Former Vice President, Ego Health Alliance, where they cooked us all up, and one of their chief scientists.
[01:36:53.032 --> 01:37:00.475]  You know, I tell the listeners that I gauged the public's awakening by how much love I get at the grocery store, at church, or on the street.
[01:37:01.455 --> 01:37:02.736]  And it's greater than ever.
[01:37:02.756 --> 01:37:03.596]  It's 99 to 1.
[01:37:04.216 --> 01:37:15.014]   But I was at a gas station about three days ago, and an old man walked up to me and he said, you don't tell me that I can't trust the FDA.
[01:37:15.014 --> 01:37:17.014]  Why don't you move to Mexico and eat poison food?
[01:37:17.014 --> 01:37:20.654]   You can't tell me that all the agencies are full of good people
[01:37:20.654 --> 01:37:21.654]  and our government's good.
[01:37:21.654 --> 01:37:24.093]  And I said, "Sir, just stop yelling at me."
[01:37:24.153 --> 01:37:26.195]  I said, the FDA now admits they were lied to.
[01:37:26.215 --> 01:37:27.176]  The shot doesn't protect you.
[01:37:27.216 --> 01:37:28.016]  It's causing all these problems.
[01:37:28.076 --> 01:37:28.957]  No, you're a liar!
[01:37:29.277 --> 01:37:29.858]  You're a disembowel.
[01:37:29.878 --> 01:37:30.979]  That's why you're off the air.
[01:37:31.019 --> 01:37:32.260]  That's why you're all this other stuff.
[01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:33.621]  And he wasn't going to listen.
[01:37:33.641 --> 01:37:34.301]  He just wanted to say that.
[01:37:34.702 --> 01:37:36.143]  And so it's not just evil people.
[01:37:36.263 --> 01:37:42.688]  It's people that still have Stockholm Syndrome and still believe they're not being lied to.
[01:37:43.029 --> 01:37:44.590]  So no, the whole government's not bad.
[01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:47.332]  The Border Patrol's not bad, but they're now run by a U.N.
[01:37:47.372 --> 01:37:49.154]  treaty and can't even stop people coming in.
[01:37:49.614 --> 01:37:51.315]  So describe a little bit about yourself.
[01:37:51.695 --> 01:37:56.078]  You already did earlier, but your awakening process and what you saw at EcoHealth Alliance that concerns you.
[01:37:56.098 --> 01:38:02.723]  And once it all happened, why you went to Congress, why you warned people, how you got harassed, because you really are a constant whistleblower.
[01:38:02.763 --> 01:38:05.725]  You're the people that old man was saying, well, they're trustworthy.
[01:38:05.745 --> 01:38:06.105]  They're great.
[01:38:06.285 --> 01:38:07.406]  Well, yeah, a lot of them are.
[01:38:07.866 --> 01:38:09.127]  And then there's silence.
[01:38:09.147 --> 01:38:11.228]  They're attacked when the good guys tell you the truth.
[01:38:11.829 --> 01:38:19.014]  Well, my awakening actually happens in December of 2019, and that's when I find out that SARS-CoV-2 is spreading around the planet.
[01:38:20.074 --> 01:38:28.496]  So, I actually had noticed some videos on an online forum of some craziness happening in Wuhan, and people said that there was some kind of disease spreading.
[01:38:28.516 --> 01:38:32.797]  So, me being an infectious disease detective of sorts, I started asking questions.
[01:38:32.817 --> 01:38:33.457]  Well, what's going on?
[01:38:33.477 --> 01:38:34.317]  Looking for information.
[01:38:35.257 --> 01:38:36.898]  And, you know, it looks like there's... Let's be clear.
[01:38:36.938 --> 01:38:41.519]  You were in secret government programs, top secret clearance, on how to track disease and where it came from.
[01:38:41.579 --> 01:38:43.039]  So, that's what you were trained in.
[01:38:43.079 --> 01:38:43.739]  That's what you did.
[01:38:43.799 --> 01:38:45.760]  So, you weren't a detective of sorts.
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:46.400]  You're an expert.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.181]  Well, maybe I'm just being humble.
[01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:49.623]  Yes, I'm an expert.
[01:38:49.923 --> 01:38:56.371]  I'm actually an FBI-trained criminal epidemiologic investigator as well.
[01:38:56.751 --> 01:38:58.173]  So I know how to look for these things.
[01:38:58.213 --> 01:39:00.015]  I know how to get to the root of the problem.
[01:39:00.555 --> 01:39:06.540]   Well, when I see this This event happening, the first thing you want to do is you want to attempt to validate it.
[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:10.682]  So I actually went and pulled PM 2.5 data.
[01:39:10.702 --> 01:39:11.842]  So that's particulate matter.
[01:39:12.903 --> 01:39:16.844]  It's a size particulate that typically causes air pollution.
[01:39:17.505 --> 01:39:22.587]  And what I did was I overlaid those data in a geographic information system, a GIS system.
[01:39:22.607 --> 01:39:25.829]  It's a software application for mapping and analyzing spatial data.
[01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:28.290]  And I overlaid it with crematoriums and guess what I saw?
[01:39:29.190 --> 01:39:33.593]  Point source emission of these crematoriums putting out a ton of pollutants.
[01:39:33.713 --> 01:39:37.576]  So that's usually a corollary or indicator that something's happening.
[01:39:37.596 --> 01:39:39.737]  And let me stop because you move so fast it's awesome.
[01:39:40.438 --> 01:39:49.204]  One of the hundreds of things you broke before you became a whistleblower was that big story came out then confirming the crematoriums they were covering up the death rate.
[01:39:49.824 --> 01:39:51.504]  Early on, and it was a real death rate.
[01:39:51.524 --> 01:39:52.705]  I saw it in my friends and family.
[01:39:52.725 --> 01:39:53.565]  This was a real virus.
[01:39:54.385 --> 01:39:57.765]  But again, that's one of the first big, huge things you broke just with your training.
[01:39:58.126 --> 01:39:58.426]  Correct.
[01:39:58.866 --> 01:39:59.546]  And so what happened?
[01:39:59.566 --> 01:40:00.286]  And you didn't want the credit.
[01:40:00.306 --> 01:40:01.726]  You just fed it out to people.
[01:40:01.766 --> 01:40:03.967]  And no, I actually, it scared the piss out of me.
[01:40:04.007 --> 01:40:07.687]  So what I did is I started calling my friends and colleagues and asked, ask what's going on.
[01:40:07.727 --> 01:40:08.567]  Why isn't the U.S.
[01:40:08.607 --> 01:40:09.068]  government?
[01:40:09.288 --> 01:40:14.268]  So if I, if I was no longer working in official capacity with the government, I'm just a scientist at home taking a look at things.
[01:40:14.308 --> 01:40:15.249]  And again, this is early 2000. 2019.
[01:40:17.869 --> 01:40:19.890]  Before it's even in the news, you're saying it.
[01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:20.470]  Correct.
[01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:21.951]  This alone is huge.
[01:40:22.191 --> 01:40:23.851]  December 2019, mid-December.
[01:40:24.272 --> 01:40:28.933]  So I start calling up my friends and other colleagues in public health, asking them what the heck's going on.
[01:40:28.973 --> 01:40:31.514]  Some of them work in the government, different levels, state, local.
[01:40:32.154 --> 01:40:36.216]  Some of us went to school together, infectious disease epidemiologists, public health doctors, medical doctors.
[01:40:36.776 --> 01:40:38.798]  And, you know, everyone's like, well, what are you talking about?
[01:40:38.818 --> 01:40:39.358]  What's going on?
[01:40:39.398 --> 01:40:45.383]  Well, about two weeks later, then it hits an infectious disease communication platform called ProMed.
[01:40:45.683 --> 01:40:46.284]  You can go look it up.
[01:40:46.324 --> 01:40:47.645]  It's ProMed.com, I believe.
[01:40:47.725 --> 01:40:48.786]  It's based out of Massachusetts.
[01:40:48.826 --> 01:40:50.107]  I actually used to do work with the company.
[01:40:50.447 --> 01:40:53.510]  But it's a... What, three months after you break this, it finally hits the news?
[01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:54.331]  Three weeks.
[01:40:54.791 --> 01:40:56.032]  So... Well, it was 2019.
[01:40:56.552 --> 01:40:58.594]  I didn't see a lot of the... Go ahead.
[01:40:58.774 --> 01:41:02.417]  Yeah, so mid-December 2019, it's moving forward.
[01:41:04.118 --> 01:41:10.343]  The disease is moving forward and then the news starts to trickle out into mainstream platforms early 2020.
[01:41:11.864 --> 01:41:14.026]  And by that time the U.S.
[01:41:14.066 --> 01:41:15.547]  government still isn't saying anything.
[01:41:16.027 --> 01:41:22.072]  When I find this highly suspect because I understand exactly how the public health infrastructure and system works.
[01:41:22.092 --> 01:41:23.033]  Supposed to warn quickly!
[01:41:23.473 --> 01:41:27.776]  Warn quickly and communicate with everyone, because the idea is, you know, we're sort of like prairie dogs.
[01:41:28.457 --> 01:41:33.821]  One guy pops up, sees an animal, and then the rest pop up and they all start chirping to warn everyone that there's something happening.
[01:41:34.141 --> 01:41:35.542]  Well, that's not taking place.
[01:41:35.702 --> 01:41:36.583]  It is dead silence.
[01:41:36.603 --> 01:41:39.345]  And then finally, and everyone else lives through this, once the U.S.
[01:41:39.365 --> 01:41:43.528]  government acknowledges that... So if you're seeing it, even though you're not currently doing that, you know they're seeing it.
[01:41:44.108 --> 01:41:45.489]  Well, I assume so.
[01:41:46.169 --> 01:41:53.134]  I mean, I'm not getting any answers, and I'm sort of... You're a prairie dog, you pop up and see five foxes and ten wolves, and there's no other prairie dogs chirping.
[01:41:54.075 --> 01:41:54.495]  Exactly.
[01:41:54.935 --> 01:41:59.138]  Well, the funny thing is, you know, I'm a guy that puts their money where their mouth was.
[01:41:59.158 --> 01:42:06.723]  I was living in California in the Bay Area at the time, and I immediately tried to get out of my house as fast as possible and move to a remote area because I think this is going to be the next big pandemic.
[01:42:07.284 --> 01:42:08.765]  And all my relatives thought I was crazy.
[01:42:09.245 --> 01:42:11.106]  My wife, you know, thought maybe I was overreacting.
[01:42:11.787 --> 01:42:13.668]  But I did it, and I moved to Michigan.
[01:42:14.409 --> 01:42:16.769]  I bet your wife listens to you now.
[01:42:16.769 --> 01:42:17.769]  Well I think a lot of people do.
[01:42:17.769 --> 01:42:18.769]  Because of this.
[01:42:18.769 --> 01:42:20.288]  I mean I think a lot of my friends thought it was crazy.
[01:42:20.288 --> 01:42:22.449]  I was telling them to start stockpiling six months of food.
[01:42:22.449 --> 01:42:23.769]  I did that myself.
[01:42:23.769 --> 01:42:27.050]   Just in case the supply chain started to break down, which ended up happening as well.
[01:42:27.050 --> 01:42:29.609]  I actually published a paper on that in 2014.
[01:42:29.609 --> 01:42:30.969]  I predicted that.
[01:42:30.969 --> 01:42:36.969]   So moving ahead here, the US government then starts coming out with a narrative, well there's
[01:42:36.969 --> 01:42:39.309]  an infectious disease in Wuhan.
[01:42:39.309 --> 01:42:42.050]  First thing that they say is, well it's not airborne transmissible.
[01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:44.689]  Complete lie.
[01:42:44.689 --> 01:42:47.889]   Then the next thing that they say is, well it's surface contact.
[01:42:47.889 --> 01:42:48.889]  We have this under control.
[01:42:48.889 --> 01:42:50.210]  This is not going to become a pandemic.
[01:42:50.135 --> 01:42:51.917]  And that's the narrative as it's starting to structure.
[01:42:52.678 --> 01:42:58.042]  Well, all of this, and your original question here is, what was the awakening here for me?
[01:42:58.343 --> 01:43:00.945]  I'm seeing all this and I can't figure out why the government is lying about all this stuff.
[01:43:01.265 --> 01:43:02.927]  Then the next thing they say is, don't wear masks.
[01:43:03.027 --> 01:43:14.137]   Well, back then, in context, When Dr. Fauci would come out and say masks, he's talking to other infectious disease doctors, epidemiologists, public health officials, and we're thinking N95 or better.
[01:43:14.157 --> 01:43:24.647]  It was none of this cloth, weird crap that we started putting on our face, because there was a mask shortage, because China had been already buying up the PPE in 2019.
[01:43:24.987 --> 01:43:26.108]  That's why there's a shortage of it.
[01:43:26.368 --> 01:43:28.310]  But anyways... Which shows a premeditation.
[01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:30.192]  Well, we'll get to that in a second.
[01:43:30.672 --> 01:43:40.475]  Well, all of this, it's just surreal to me, being a person that worked in this system with these people, that all this has happened, and I couldn't understand it.
[01:43:41.796 --> 01:43:43.056]  Stay there, this is riveting.
[01:43:43.096 --> 01:43:44.017]  Dr. Huff, stay there.
[01:43:44.077 --> 01:43:45.557]  The book is really about Wuhan.
[01:43:45.617 --> 01:43:46.237]  Get it now.
[01:43:46.737 --> 01:43:47.138]  Share it.
[01:43:47.178 --> 01:43:47.658]  Skyhorse.
[01:43:47.698 --> 01:43:49.518]  Save folks who put out The Great Reach of the World.
[01:43:49.858 --> 01:43:50.719]  Get both the books.
[01:43:50.779 --> 01:43:51.779]  People are ready for the truth.
[01:43:51.799 --> 01:43:52.399]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:55.040]  Dr. Andrew Huff is here.
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:56.621]  You want to whistleblower from the inside?
[01:43:57.884 --> 01:44:07.234]  You want somebody, as I tracked all this news, exposed, it was in the lab, it was man-made, it was a control mechanism, he's here right now.
[01:44:07.314 --> 01:44:08.275]  So you got caught up on the break.
[01:44:09.245 --> 01:44:11.967]  Please continue, we've got all the points you sent me you wanted to get to.
[01:44:12.787 --> 01:44:14.548]  Just let him have it, Dr. Huff.
[01:44:15.029 --> 01:44:21.793]  Well, picking up where I left off, so in 2020, as the government narrative is rolling out, I'm questioning everything, I've already moved and relocated.
[01:44:22.653 --> 01:44:25.815]  Well, then I started asking questions and I don't know who to trust in the government.
[01:44:26.956 --> 01:44:32.980]  Because the government's response and the things they're saying didn't align with other things that I had worked on.
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:38.083]   For example, different government agencies have Pandemic preparedness plans.
[01:44:38.103 --> 01:44:42.165]  There's a national one, and then the agencies have them, and sometimes the sub-agencies have these.
[01:44:42.205 --> 01:44:45.267]  And in that plan it tells you how you're supposed to respond to a pandemic.
[01:44:46.328 --> 01:44:48.429]  Nowhere in there does it say that we're going to have lockdowns.
[01:44:48.749 --> 01:44:53.552]  So actually, it does say that you can have a short kind of quarantine or lockdown.
[01:44:53.572 --> 01:44:56.114]  That all came from the WF, the UN, Big Pharma.
[01:44:56.781 --> 01:45:10.075]  Well, if you're talking about the strategy to push out the lockdowns, they capitalized on that as part of the cover-up.
[01:45:10.856 --> 01:45:12.978]  So, I can skip around here a little bit.
[01:45:12.998 --> 01:45:13.598]  No, I'm going to shut up.
[01:45:13.638 --> 01:45:14.119]  Go, go, go.
[01:45:14.319 --> 01:45:14.499]  Okay.
[01:45:16.041 --> 01:45:17.242]  Now you tossed me off a little bit.
[01:45:19.105 --> 01:45:35.578]  The National Pandemic Preparedness Plans are these documents that scientists and public health experts have been working on for a number of years, and we actually tested and modeled scenarios using these supercomputers to figure out the best strategies to implement when the big next big one hits.
[01:45:36.178 --> 01:45:40.942]   And through testing and those modeling and simulations, Two weeks is actually a good number.
[01:45:41.503 --> 01:45:43.085]  They were actually telling the truth about that.
[01:45:44.146 --> 01:45:45.227]  To buy some time.
[01:45:45.688 --> 01:45:49.432]  It can buy you some time real quick to help you make a better decision in the future, but that's it.
[01:45:49.932 --> 01:45:54.217]  And typically it only works if you can catch it early on when the disease first starts spreading.
[01:45:54.337 --> 01:45:56.259]  If it's in one country, shut that down and isolate.
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:57.400]  Potentially.
[01:45:58.281 --> 01:46:00.222]  And even if it's a big country, maybe not.
[01:46:00.302 --> 01:46:03.723]  I mean, maybe a small country, I'm talking maybe a city, a state.
[01:46:03.883 --> 01:46:07.945]  If you can get ahead of it that way by shutting down a region for two weeks, not a bad idea.
[01:46:08.526 --> 01:46:09.306]  But here's the problem.
[01:46:10.187 --> 01:46:15.529]  COVID started spreading around the planet in late August or early September of 2019.
[01:46:17.230 --> 01:46:18.091]  And that's a hard fact.
[01:46:18.131 --> 01:46:19.172]  So that's actually backed up.
[01:46:19.212 --> 01:46:22.355]  And in my book, I think I have about seven or eight different citations related to that.
[01:46:22.736 --> 01:46:35.309]  Different epidemiologists around the planet went and analyzed blood serology samples and found that this disease was captured actually in blood banks and other things for people who donated blood.
[01:46:35.329 --> 01:46:36.910]  So they went and analyzed these samples.
[01:46:37.711 --> 01:46:40.872]  And it's hard proof that this disease had already been spreading.
[01:46:41.452 --> 01:46:48.735]  And it had already spread to Europe, Italy, France, and a few other places by early September 2019.
[01:46:49.495 --> 01:46:51.256]  Now let that sink in for a second.
[01:46:51.936 --> 01:46:53.977]  I caught wind of it in December 2019.
[01:46:55.258 --> 01:46:58.519]  So the disease had already been spreading around the planet for months.
[01:46:59.901 --> 01:47:06.222]  So, when all the conspiracy theorists, and I don't even like to say that anymore because the conspiracy turns out to be true.
[01:47:06.262 --> 01:47:07.103]  Just people who question.
[01:47:07.303 --> 01:47:08.123]  Yeah, people who question.
[01:47:08.143 --> 01:47:12.484]  Well, skeptics and critical thinkers, maybe, and people who are unsure.
[01:47:12.604 --> 01:47:14.404]  Being informed is called being a conspiracy theorist.
[01:47:15.085 --> 01:47:16.365]  Well, unfortunately, nowadays.
[01:47:16.885 --> 01:47:18.605]  It might actually set you up for the Inquisition.
[01:47:19.185 --> 01:47:24.507]  Well, so, the disease started spreading around the planet in the fall of 2019.
[01:47:26.147 --> 01:47:36.450]  Then, and we know this is a fact that it actually leaked out of the Wuhan Institute of Virology because the Chinese start buying laboratory containment equipment to get ahead of the leak.
[01:47:37.450 --> 01:47:44.333]  And so, the Chinese are aware that the disease has, they have a leak, they have an ongoing leak problem, they're trying to plug the leak.
[01:47:45.073 --> 01:47:55.476]  Then, the next thing that happens is it seems like that's when the US government and the Chinese government start to, I guess, collaborate on this cover-up.
[01:47:56.858 --> 01:47:58.019]  That's based on their actions.
[01:47:58.119 --> 01:48:11.410]  So, because I used to work in the government, I understand how the Department of Defense and the public health system works to capture information, the biosurveillance, to detect these diseases.
[01:48:11.730 --> 01:48:25.301]  The other thing that's interesting about the Wuhan Institute of Virology is that it's been well known in national security circles for over a decade that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is likely a bioweapons laboratory.
[01:48:25.721 --> 01:48:25.942]  Okay?
[01:48:27.031 --> 01:48:42.081]  And I'm sort of hopping around here, and we can come back to this, and I can tie this back into my story at EcoHealth Alliance, but why this is important is, if you have a bioweapons laboratory in a place like China, all the Five Eyes nations are going to be watching that laboratory to see what they're doing and what's going on.
[01:48:42.501 --> 01:48:43.622]  So the idea that the U.S.
[01:48:43.662 --> 01:48:49.846]  government didn't know that this disease had leaked out, in my opinion, is just surreal.
[01:48:49.866 --> 01:48:50.387]  Well for me...
[01:48:51.247 --> 01:48:53.209]  This was banned here in 2015.
[01:48:53.329 --> 01:48:54.489]  It was a big scandal.
[01:48:54.910 --> 01:48:57.031]  So they move it there for plausible deniability.
[01:48:57.772 --> 01:49:01.594]  Do you want to release something where nobody gets blamed, but everybody gets control from it?
[01:49:02.715 --> 01:49:04.216]  Well, actually, it was before that.
[01:49:04.296 --> 01:49:09.820]  So this whole gain-of-function work, when I say Ecolab Alliance, kicked off in 2013 or 2012.
[01:49:10.621 --> 01:49:13.503]  I actually have the original gain-of-function proposal.
[01:49:13.543 --> 01:49:16.425]  No, I agree, but it came to a head in 2015 when scientists in the U.S.
[01:49:16.465 --> 01:49:17.706]  said, we shouldn't be doing this.
[01:49:18.925 --> 01:49:28.027]  Well, not only did it come to a head, they actually created a policy to ban gain-of-function work domestically.
[01:49:28.587 --> 01:49:38.329]  And then, this is where it gets sort of crazy, is that then we actually outsourced that gain-of-function work to the Wuhan Institute of Virology through my old employer, EcoHealth Alliance.
[01:49:38.949 --> 01:49:49.351]   And the government, for Dr. Anthony Fauci and these other people at the National Institute of Health to come out and say that they didn't know that this was gain-of-function work, It's just complete BS.
[01:49:49.391 --> 01:49:51.592]  We actually talked about it when I worked at Ecolab Alliance.
[01:49:51.972 --> 01:49:57.413]  I mean, can you imagine having a bunch of scientists that worked and did gain a function in infectious diseases?
[01:49:57.453 --> 01:49:58.833]  You do a great job, everybody.
[01:49:58.853 --> 01:50:00.133]  The background, how it all interconnects.
[01:50:00.693 --> 01:50:01.573]  Do this when we come back.
[01:50:01.593 --> 01:50:15.416]  We've got about three minutes of break, but just the quantification or your analysis of what this is, because we can go over where it came from and what happened, but the overall motive, just the gut level as a citizen of the world, what is this?
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:22.983]  Well, this is the biggest scandal in human history.
[01:50:23.964 --> 01:50:30.568]  What the gain-of-function work really is, it's bioweapons research gone awry.
[01:50:30.828 --> 01:50:39.833]  The whole notion of why we do gain-of-function work is basically to make medical countermeasures for bioterror attacks, biodefense, and pandemic preparedness.
[01:50:40.794 --> 01:50:54.199]  There is really no justifiable public health reason or medical reason to be engaged in this type of work because it's based on one simple premise or illogical inconsistency.
[01:50:55.039 --> 01:51:00.821]  And that is, humans can predict how nature will evolve an infectious disease agent.
[01:51:01.801 --> 01:51:03.221]  And it's impossible.
[01:51:04.082 --> 01:51:07.382]  So this whole gain-of-function process is this.
[01:51:07.762 --> 01:51:19.125]  Well, if we take SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus, and we evolve it one step into the future, well then we can make a drug, a vaccine, a medical countermeasure, a therapy to treat it.
[01:51:21.165 --> 01:51:31.998]   The problem is what actually happens is they evolve these things 100,000, 150,000 years into the future with diseases and animals and agents that will never come into contact with each other.
[01:51:32.779 --> 01:51:35.602]  Then they make the medical countermeasure for it.
[01:51:36.223 --> 01:51:38.826]  That's what really happened and that's what's going on all over the world right now.
[01:51:38.866 --> 01:51:40.428]  And they release it to be the saviors.
[01:51:41.169 --> 01:51:42.550]  Well, I don't think it was released.
[01:51:43.771 --> 01:51:44.892]  And I'm pretty firm on that.
[01:51:44.912 --> 01:51:54.879]  If you look at the Chinese behavior and their stated objectives, from the Chinese Communist Party's stated objectives from 2016 to 2018... Hold on, so you think it was an accident?
[01:51:54.999 --> 01:52:08.689]  I do believe firmly it's an accident, because the Chinese behavior... So, in the book I actually do... Hold on, let's talk about that when we come back, because I'm not disagreeing with you, and I respect you, but I want to talk about that, because you see pre-programming before, though, Fauci saying Trump will be challenged by a big virus.
[01:52:09.689 --> 01:52:14.513]  They're gonna get power, the Rockefeller lockstep operation, they wanted this to happen.
[01:52:15.594 --> 01:52:16.135]  We'll talk about it.
[01:52:16.595 --> 01:52:26.083]  And the book, The Truth About Wuhan, How I Uncovered the Biggest Lie in History, by Dr. Andrew G. Huff, former EcoHealth Alliance Vice President and Senior Scientist.
[01:52:26.764 --> 01:52:27.825]  He's here with us now.
[01:52:27.965 --> 01:52:31.908]  Regardless of whether they release it or not, you're saying it's man-made gain-of-function.
[01:52:32.408 --> 01:52:38.833]  I see the pre-programming, the UN, the ZZX, the power grab, the lockdowns, the Great Reset, the New World Order, all of it.
[01:52:39.333 --> 01:52:39.774]  Continue.
[01:52:40.574 --> 01:52:49.781]  Well, so going back to where we left off, so the Chinese Communist Party's objectives, I analyzed the Chinese Communist Party's objectives and I discussed this in my book.
[01:52:49.821 --> 01:52:53.764]   I do sort of an intelligence scenario analysis looking at Why?
[01:52:53.784 --> 01:52:56.665]  What would be their motive and who's motive for releasing this?
[01:52:57.025 --> 01:53:03.286]  So the first thing you logically do is you have to eliminate all the other people that would possibly want to do this.
[01:53:03.346 --> 01:53:07.127]  So you could say, this could have been a false flagged attack from the US government.
[01:53:08.128 --> 01:53:10.008]  The Chinese could intentionally release it.
[01:53:10.068 --> 01:53:11.128]  It could have been an accident.
[01:53:11.348 --> 01:53:13.149]  It could be a combination of events actually.
[01:53:14.289 --> 01:53:19.510]  You know, maybe it was accidentally released and then they intentionally released something to throw people off.
[01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:22.311]  These are all possible scenarios.
[01:53:22.931 --> 01:53:27.552]  The thing is, the Chinese Communist Party from 2016 to 2018, they have very clear objectives.
[01:53:27.572 --> 01:53:30.573]  They want to increase the size of the party by a million people.
[01:53:31.293 --> 01:53:33.933]  They want to be the global superpower.
[01:53:35.294 --> 01:53:47.939]   They want to actually, well, with those two objectives alone, If they intentionally release the agent on their own soil, it undermines those two objectives.
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:53.627]  And the thing that we have to remember here is this has been a terrible disaster for the Chinese people as well.
[01:53:54.728 --> 01:53:56.571]  They've lost millions of people too.
[01:53:57.677 --> 01:54:03.838]  They've actually had their GDPs went down after the agent is released.
[01:54:04.759 --> 01:54:10.200]  And the other thing that happens is, everyone now is questioning China.
[01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:17.861]  It doesn't look like, at least how people perceive China, it actually weakens their position.
[01:54:17.961 --> 01:54:20.222]  Andrew, I want to agree with you a thousand percent here.
[01:54:21.451 --> 01:54:26.234]  It's a globalist group above China that used that lab as a pretext to set them up.
[01:54:26.254 --> 01:54:28.756]  I don't think China launches as a weapon.
[01:54:28.796 --> 01:54:33.639]  I think the globalist WFUN combine that already had their responses ready.
[01:54:34.039 --> 01:54:36.581]  They're pre-programming them, telling us the pandemic's imminent.
[01:54:36.921 --> 01:54:38.763]  We're going to bring in world government through the pandemic.
[01:54:39.083 --> 01:54:42.705]  I think that globalist group put it there to be able to set China up.
[01:54:42.765 --> 01:54:43.886]  Not that I like communist China.
[01:54:44.326 --> 01:54:46.568]  I don't think Chinese government launched this.
[01:54:47.268 --> 01:54:50.891]  I think the globalists launched this in China for plausible deniability.
[01:54:51.671 --> 01:55:00.576]  That's certainly possible, and that would sort of be like a Lone Wolf or Insider type attack where maybe they bribed some employees who worked at the laboratory.
[01:55:00.596 --> 01:55:01.396]  Well, a few operatives.
[01:55:01.416 --> 01:55:02.137]  They're in the death cult.
[01:55:03.297 --> 01:55:03.818]  The death cult?
[01:55:03.878 --> 01:55:12.302]  Well, I don't know about that, but the issue here is if you look at intent, those are all very high risk activities.
[01:55:12.703 --> 01:55:13.603]  It's certainly possible.
[01:55:13.623 --> 01:55:19.126]  I think it's more the case that after this leaks, the globalists all pile on board and get on the same plan.
[01:55:19.146 --> 01:55:20.767]  So they use the crisis.
[01:55:21.067 --> 01:55:21.847]  They use the crisis.
[01:55:21.867 --> 01:55:25.489]  You never let a good crisis go to waste, like Rahm Emanuel used to say.
[01:55:26.129 --> 01:55:44.315]  So, the one thing you have to realize about organizations like the World Economic Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, now the Gates Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, the Rothschilds, all these old, huge, wealthy families and organizations, the Google Foundation, they have business intelligence units which are similar to what governments have.
[01:55:45.155 --> 01:55:51.659]  And in these business intelligence units, they have 20, 30, 40 analysts sitting there collecting information, analyzing things going on.
[01:55:51.679 --> 01:55:54.741]  They collect human intelligence like the government does.
[01:55:54.761 --> 01:55:57.303]  I mean, they're running similar kinds of intelligence.
[01:55:57.323 --> 01:55:59.444]  Yeah, intelligence agencies just aren't in governments.
[01:55:59.664 --> 01:56:00.025]  Correct.
[01:56:00.085 --> 01:56:04.608]  They're also in businesses and corporations and other non-governmental organizations.
[01:56:05.288 --> 01:56:09.811]  So what I think happens, and what I strongly suspect happens, is that they all catch wind of this.
[01:56:10.211 --> 01:56:11.232]  Earlier than everybody else.
[01:56:11.732 --> 01:56:13.313]  So like I said, I was just snooping around.
[01:56:13.353 --> 01:56:15.174]  I caught it by accident in mid-December 2019.
[01:56:15.274 --> 01:56:20.817]  Well, if you have analysts who are going around looking for this stuff all the time, of course they probably picked up on it earlier.
[01:56:20.837 --> 01:56:21.958]  So they jump on the trend.
[01:56:22.058 --> 01:56:22.538]  Exactly.
[01:56:22.598 --> 01:56:23.919]  And then they go talk to their friends.
[01:56:24.099 --> 01:56:27.221]  So all these people have partnered up at the World Economic Foundation.
[01:56:27.241 --> 01:56:28.542]  That's one place where they all come together.
[01:56:28.562 --> 01:56:33.164]  I was actually invited to attend back in 2015 and I didn't go.
[01:56:33.184 --> 01:56:36.526]  And my views on that organization has shifted along the way.
[01:56:41.086 --> 01:56:42.207]  These people all know each other.
[01:56:42.447 --> 01:56:46.728]  I can imagine Bill Gates getting on his phone texting Soros saying, hey, there's something going on here.
[01:56:46.748 --> 01:56:47.348]  Let's get on board here.
[01:56:47.368 --> 01:56:49.089]  Here's a chance for us to push something.
[01:56:49.909 --> 01:56:55.651]  And if you look at how the Gates Foundation specifically is invested into vaccine technology and other things that end up coming down the line.
[01:56:55.671 --> 01:57:00.694]   Well, that was my next question because I want to believe they're Super centralized and know what they're doing, and overall they do.
[01:57:00.714 --> 01:57:09.681]  He was bragging on TV three years ago, I make 22 times the money on vaccine investment, but now they pushed a dangerous mRNA that doesn't protect and hurts people.
[01:57:10.162 --> 01:57:13.564]  If I want to destroy myself, I would just set myself on fire versus this.
[01:57:13.624 --> 01:57:17.147]  I mean, they have made themselves the villains, the world know they're behind it.
[01:57:17.748 --> 01:57:20.390]  What do you make of the so-called vaccine and the carnage?
[01:57:21.070 --> 01:57:23.031]  Well, my position has shifted.
[01:57:23.151 --> 01:57:27.914]  So, actually, I probably didn't do enough research when the mRNA jab first came out.
[01:57:27.934 --> 01:57:29.354]  I was actually recommending that people get it.
[01:57:30.435 --> 01:57:33.877]  I was a little skeptical and worried about actually negative or adverse events from it.
[01:57:34.137 --> 01:57:36.778]  So I waited three months because I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist.
[01:57:36.798 --> 01:57:39.460]  The government in my state said that you could be one of the first people to get it, but I waited.
[01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:50.588]  And about three months later, I start looking at histopathology reports, and I start seeing tissue damage in reproductive tissues and ovaries in women.
[01:57:50.968 --> 01:57:57.012]  Well, at that point, they're dangling the carrot over me to travel, and I go, ah, well, maybe this only affects females.
[01:57:57.252 --> 01:57:57.933]  I'm a male.
[01:57:58.453 --> 01:57:58.954]  I get jabbed.
[01:57:59.494 --> 01:58:05.080]  So I go get my two doses of Moderna, and I'm not some kind of anti-vaxxer.
[01:58:05.781 --> 01:58:14.450]  Because I was in the military and I worked in this field, I probably have three sheets long of a vaccine record of things I've had to be inoculated with.
[01:58:15.131 --> 01:58:27.180]  Well, this is the sickest I've ever been in my life, and then the epidemiology data starts to come in from what we're told, what the performance of this mRNA jab was, versus the reality.
[01:58:27.721 --> 01:58:33.986]  So, first we find out that the jabs do not prevent infectious disease transmission, okay?
[01:58:34.066 --> 01:58:41.432]  And that is the whole reason why public health officials, or why we've typically recommended that you vaccinate an entire population.
[01:58:41.972 --> 01:58:46.055]  And they were talking about that early on, and all of a sudden, well, the vaccine doesn't prevent transmission.
[01:58:46.095 --> 01:58:48.817]  I don't even like calling it a vaccine, because it's actually a gene therapy.
[01:58:49.137 --> 01:58:56.682]  And executives from, like, bachelor's... So why would they bet on something that in rat studies similar shots cause major health problems for rats?
[01:58:57.283 --> 01:58:58.223]  I don't think they're that stupid.
[01:58:59.504 --> 01:59:02.306]  Well, I mean, this is where you can start asking questions.
[01:59:03.147 --> 01:59:05.148]  I don't know if they're that stupid, but I think they are that greedy.
[01:59:06.930 --> 01:59:08.511]  And they thought, we control the media, just do it.
[01:59:09.505 --> 01:59:12.207]  Well, it's not that they just control the media.
[01:59:14.088 --> 01:59:17.250]  There's actually a cover-up mentality to this.
[01:59:17.290 --> 01:59:21.733]  So once they find out that the mRNA jab could have adverse events or side effects, they start pushing it on.
[01:59:21.994 --> 01:59:25.216]  And they keep on even pushing it, though, even though it doesn't stop transmission.
[01:59:25.856 --> 01:59:28.858]  And there are problems associated with it for some people.
[01:59:29.659 --> 01:59:33.742]  If you jab everyone in the population, there's no control group to compare against.
[01:59:34.602 --> 01:59:42.808]  So it makes it much more difficult to then conduct scientific studies or launch lawsuits against the pharmaceutical companies if everyone's jabbed.
[01:59:43.469 --> 01:59:46.831]  And if you give it to children, exactly, there's no control group.
[01:59:47.191 --> 01:59:51.595]  If you give it to children, though, then vaccine liability protection kicks in.
[01:59:52.815 --> 01:59:53.236]  I didn't know that.
[01:59:53.256 --> 01:59:53.616]  Is that true?
[01:59:54.056 --> 01:59:54.897]  Yeah.
[01:59:55.217 --> 01:59:59.921]  If a governor even mandates it nationwide, then it protects it from liability.
[02:00:01.013 --> 02:00:01.574]  Oh, interesting.
[02:00:01.594 --> 02:00:05.717]  Well, I mean, the vaccine immunity is really interesting in this specific case, though, too.
[02:00:05.837 --> 02:00:12.783]  These documents came out last week, is that the emergency use authorization for the mRNA jab.
[02:00:12.803 --> 02:00:15.925]  So, first of all, they discount the other drugs that work.
[02:00:15.945 --> 02:00:23.011]  So, hydroxychloroquine, pepsid AC, zinc, vitamin D, all these things that work.
[02:00:23.031 --> 02:00:24.172]  And they didn't tell people to get healthy.
[02:00:24.812 --> 02:00:25.773]  So, they discount all these things.
[02:00:25.793 --> 02:00:28.975]  They lie and they fabricate that to get the emergency use authorization.
[02:00:29.916 --> 02:00:32.678]  And that's all pushed through the Department of Defense.
[02:00:33.138 --> 02:00:40.803]  And they did it as a national emergency, biowarfare, pandemic type... Which bypassed all the regular checks and balances.
[02:00:40.884 --> 02:00:41.264]  Correct.
[02:00:41.624 --> 02:00:44.126]  And so it didn't come from NIH like everyone thinks.
[02:00:44.826 --> 02:00:47.728]  So you start to look at this, why we're doing this and why they want mRNA.
[02:00:47.768 --> 02:00:59.276]  So the interesting history here behind mRNA, and this is where Dr. Malone is a great person to talk to, is that mRNA technology was built because we have a fundamental problem in medicine and public health.
[02:01:00.537 --> 02:01:03.239]  Traditional vaccines take too long to manufacture.
[02:01:03.779 --> 02:01:05.781]  They take nine months, best-case scenario.
[02:01:06.982 --> 02:01:15.328]  And so, if you're a national security person working in biowarfare, bioterrorism, or you're a senior public health official, we have a real problem.
[02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:17.390]  So, a pandemic happens.
[02:01:17.410 --> 02:01:21.693]  You have an infectious disease outbreak, and it looks like it turned into a pandemic, and it happens quickly.
[02:01:22.334 --> 02:01:25.897]  Well, if you don't have a drug or a countermeasure for that, you're toast.
[02:01:27.216 --> 02:01:28.117]  Well, you could be.
[02:01:28.617 --> 02:01:34.821]  If you look at SARS-CoV-2, it actually wasn't that bad in terms of morbidity and mortality later stages of the disease.
[02:01:36.182 --> 02:01:49.970]  So, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, sub-agencies, they want, and public health agencies like Health and Human Services, they want a platform that they can rapidly modify to match whatever disease emerges.
[02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:52.031]  Stay right there, stay rammed through mRNA.
[02:01:52.051 --> 02:01:52.692]  We'll be right back.
[02:01:54.167 --> 02:02:04.472]  And the accumulated amount is now trapping as much extra heat as would be released by 600,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding every single day on the earth.
[02:02:04.732 --> 02:02:20.720]   That's what's boiling the oceans, creating these atmospheric rivers and the rain bombs and sucking the moisture out of the land and creating the droughts and melting the ice and raising the sea level and causing these waves of climate refugees predicted to reach one One billion in this century?
[02:02:20.961 --> 02:02:27.543]  Look at the xenophobia and political authoritarian trends that have come from just a few million refugees.
[02:02:27.663 --> 02:02:28.543]  What about a billion?
[02:02:28.803 --> 02:02:32.344]  We would lose our capacity for self-governance on this world.
[02:02:32.925 --> 02:02:34.385]  We have to act.
[02:02:34.805 --> 02:02:43.368]  So in answer to your question, I would say we have to have a sense of urgency much greater than we have yet had.
[02:02:43.248 --> 02:02:45.448]  and we need to make some changes.
[02:02:45.448 --> 02:03:01.447]  [silence]
[02:03:02.322 --> 02:03:06.643]  I mean, I had COVID, the flu, and a bacterial infection all at the same time about a month ago.
[02:03:06.663 --> 02:03:07.884]  And that was going to kill me.
[02:03:08.504 --> 02:03:09.864]  Well, let's talk about that on air.
[02:03:10.624 --> 02:03:12.805]  After you took the COVID shot, you said you got the sickest ever.
[02:03:13.505 --> 02:03:16.386]  And that's what everybody's saying, is they would never have taken the COVID shot if they knew what it did.
[02:03:16.826 --> 02:03:20.607]  The studies, the numbers, you're an expert on this, are showing it's really hurting our immune systems.
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:23.382]  Oh, it's completely hurting our immune systems.
[02:03:24.423 --> 02:03:43.195]   So, if you actually look at the population health data, from places like Scotland, for example, where they had high vaccine compliance, so they nearly vaccinated the entire population in in Scotland and when you look at the results of the blood
[02:03:43.195 --> 02:03:48.735]   analyses, lymphocyte, neutrophil counts, O-type immunity, it was virtually destroyed.
[02:03:48.735 --> 02:03:55.295]   And there's more and more publications coming out by the day that indicate the mRNA jabs
[02:03:55.295 --> 02:04:00.534]  and the new bivalent jabs are actually destroying immunity.
[02:04:00.534 --> 02:04:06.295]   Now you're saying they didn't do this on purpose and I respect you, but I think you have your
[02:04:06.295 --> 02:04:09.295]  own bias is a good person, project it onto it.
[02:04:09.121 --> 02:04:10.302]  I could go for hours.
[02:04:10.783 --> 02:04:20.369]  They had documents years ago at University of Texas that Corona mRNA, as you were saying earlier, therapies cause massive problems.
[02:04:20.389 --> 02:04:25.652]  They work for some animals, some rats, some humans, but they cause massive problems with others.
[02:04:25.672 --> 02:04:31.957]  I mean, I saw this a few months ago, a test with mRNA and gene therapy in New York, and the one person that tested it died.
[02:04:32.957 --> 02:04:36.318]  So, as Malone has said, they tried for decades to get this through.
[02:04:36.358 --> 02:04:39.099]  They wish it would work, but it's like Russian roulette.
[02:04:39.939 --> 02:04:41.659]  And so I pull back when they know.
[02:04:42.259 --> 02:04:42.880]  Let's just say this.
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:44.900]  They know now it doesn't protect you.
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:51.582]  I've got CNN articles yesterday saying scientists and FDA angry that vaccine doesn't work.
[02:04:51.642 --> 02:04:53.402]  They were lied to and actually makes you sicker.
[02:04:53.422 --> 02:04:55.023]  I mean, I've got the headlines.
[02:04:55.423 --> 02:04:56.763]  I'll show them here while you're talking.
[02:04:57.283 --> 02:05:00.744]  So now that they know they're not still admitting they're wrong.
[02:05:01.464 --> 02:05:02.285]  I get your argument.
[02:05:02.305 --> 02:05:04.707]  You can say, well, they never admit they're wrong.
[02:05:04.747 --> 02:05:06.169]  Like Trump keeps saying it's perfect.
[02:05:06.209 --> 02:05:08.571]  He, I didn't even couldn't bring myself to play yesterday.
[02:05:08.591 --> 02:05:11.934]  He was on, he was on Newsmax and it was just disgusting.
[02:05:11.974 --> 02:05:13.175]  Like five minutes of him.
[02:05:13.756 --> 02:05:15.417]  Oh, we stopped the Spanish flu.
[02:05:15.457 --> 02:05:16.919]  We saved 50 million people.
[02:05:17.499 --> 02:05:18.440]  Oh, no one's hurt.
[02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:19.261]  It works perfect.
[02:05:19.661 --> 02:05:22.163]  I mean, he is the worst now on that.
[02:05:22.524 --> 02:05:24.706]  I don't think he's a bad person, but God is he pigheaded.
[02:05:25.026 --> 02:05:30.728]  No, and I think it's actually undermining his chances to be nominated to run for president again.
[02:05:32.248 --> 02:05:48.514]  If you look at, I think, the Republicans and conservatives and libertarians who tend to align with President Trump or that party, the fact that he can't come out and admit that this Operation Warp Speed and the mRNA jabs have been a mistake... He can blame Fauci that told him to do it!
[02:05:48.534 --> 02:05:49.214]  I was just going to say that.
[02:05:49.494 --> 02:05:51.815]  He could probably go to state and blame Fauci and Birx.
[02:05:51.835 --> 02:05:52.575]  Because that's who did it!
[02:05:53.328 --> 02:05:55.989]  Well, and I think that'd be a smart political move.
[02:05:56.450 --> 02:05:58.751]  I mean, look, everybody forgives the Santas.
[02:05:58.831 --> 02:05:59.892]  He said, I did it early on.
[02:05:59.912 --> 02:06:00.412]  I was wrong.
[02:06:00.692 --> 02:06:01.292]  They're lying.
[02:06:01.472 --> 02:06:02.233]  That's OK.
[02:06:02.253 --> 02:06:02.853]  We understand.
[02:06:02.873 --> 02:06:07.416]  Well, and people make mistakes, and I think actions... Don't you become an accessory by then once you know?
[02:06:07.676 --> 02:06:08.416]  That's what I was saying.
[02:06:08.456 --> 02:06:09.617]  It's like they all know now.
[02:06:10.177 --> 02:06:14.580]  Well, I think they are accessories, and here's the strange part of this.
[02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:25.567]  If Congress gets off its butt and does its job, there are strong criminal penalties that I think could be justified for numerous high-level bureaucrats and technocrats.
[02:06:25.927 --> 02:06:28.049]  I mean, I've said it on social media a number of times.
[02:06:29.049 --> 02:06:31.031]  Dr. Anthony Fauci should be facing the death penalty.
[02:06:31.612 --> 02:06:33.013]  And I don't think that's an overstatement.
[02:06:33.073 --> 02:06:34.214]  Millions of people have died.
[02:06:34.855 --> 02:06:42.502]  And what other genocidal maniac have we allowed to go free and at least not face a trial for the kinds of things that he's done?
[02:06:42.542 --> 02:06:44.825]  I mean, it is Nazi fascism.
[02:06:45.305 --> 02:06:50.944]   uh... the exactly and quantify the juror expert trained certified degrees in this
[02:06:50.944 --> 02:06:55.855]   f_b_i_ defense department explain to people you don't do gain of function because it
[02:06:55.855 --> 02:07:00.545]   could get out it's illegal that's life in prison when you know about a lot of
[02:07:00.545 --> 02:07:02.305]   congress it's death penalty and we're not
[02:07:02.631 --> 02:07:16.808]  It's not about a fetish to kill Fauci, but I mean literally we need to scare other people and create a challenge to it so there's a major sort of Damocles over people's heads and think about this.
[02:07:17.268 --> 02:07:17.868]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:07:18.428 --> 02:07:28.730]  And people like my, this actually then ties into other people, people like my former boss, Dr. Peter Daszak, Dr. Ralph Baric at the University of North Carolina, Dr. Ian Lipkin at Columbia University.
[02:07:29.050 --> 02:07:46.394]  These people are all yes-men and co-conspirators for not only the agent SARS-CoV-2, because the thing that everyone has to remember here, the biotechnology that the Chinese had at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, that came from the United States out of Ralph Baric and Ian Lipkin's laboratories.
[02:07:47.154 --> 02:07:50.897]  The Chinese were actually 10 years roughly or so behind the United States.
[02:07:50.917 --> 02:07:52.098]  So why did we jump them ahead?
[02:07:52.618 --> 02:07:54.159]  Well, that's a great question.
[02:07:54.199 --> 02:07:58.762]  So I talk about this in my book and this is why I say it's the biggest intelligence failure in U.S.
[02:07:58.802 --> 02:07:59.142]  history.
[02:07:59.583 --> 02:08:01.164]  Or they want plausible deniability.
[02:08:01.758 --> 02:08:05.621]  Well, no, I don't think it's that they want plausible deniability.
[02:08:05.921 --> 02:08:10.064]  This is my belief, and I think I have good facts to support this.
[02:08:10.704 --> 02:08:16.528]  The United States gave advanced biotechnology to the Wuhan Institute of Virology so we could collect intelligence on it.
[02:08:16.588 --> 02:08:22.833]  So remember how I said that everybody in the national security world knew that the WIV was the bioweapons lab for the Chinese?
[02:08:25.134 --> 02:08:26.135]  Here's a fun question, let me ask.
[02:08:26.155 --> 02:08:29.677]  Do you think that the Chinese need $400,000 of U.S.
[02:08:29.717 --> 02:08:30.858]  money to do gain-of-function work?
[02:08:31.058 --> 02:08:31.218]  No.
[02:08:31.678 --> 02:08:32.599]  Do they need $5 million?
[02:08:32.779 --> 02:08:32.919]  No.
[02:08:33.079 --> 02:08:34.120]  Do they need $50 million?
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:34.340]  No.
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:35.881]  There's no number you could put on it.
[02:08:35.921 --> 02:08:37.262]  So what did the Chinese get out of this?
[02:08:37.502 --> 02:08:38.602]  They're spying on both sides.
[02:08:38.842 --> 02:08:39.623]  Well, exactly.
[02:08:39.663 --> 02:08:41.524]  So they need the advanced biotechnology.
[02:08:41.784 --> 02:08:42.845]  So this is what happens.
[02:08:42.885 --> 02:08:43.565]  This is the trade.
[02:08:43.965 --> 02:08:47.708]  So the United States government gives the advanced biotechnology to the WIV.
[02:08:48.468 --> 02:08:52.492]  So we can have access to their laboratory to inspect or sort of see what's going on there.
[02:08:52.872 --> 02:08:57.476]  Dr. Anthony Fauci, so when my story started gaining more prominence, I couldn't believe it.
[02:08:57.536 --> 02:09:02.260]  I felt like I was actually driving the White House for a period of months and with my attorney Tom Renz.
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:09.687]  Dr. Anthony Fauci came out after I started saying this on social media and said, well, we need to see what's going on over at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[02:09:10.367 --> 02:09:18.430]  Well, why does a Health and Human Services sub-agency director, Dr. Anthony Fauci, care what's happening?
[02:09:18.450 --> 02:09:20.610]  We're almost out of time, and you invited me out to dinner.
[02:09:20.710 --> 02:09:21.150]  You're here this week.
[02:09:21.170 --> 02:09:22.091]  You've been on a bunch of shows.
[02:09:22.591 --> 02:09:30.673]  I'd love to go to dinner with you, but I'd really rather just say we're doing an emergency Saturday show, commercial-free, and come here tomorrow and talk to millions of people, because that's what I really want to do.
[02:09:30.833 --> 02:09:31.133]  Let's do it.
[02:09:31.153 --> 02:09:31.894]  And we can order a pizza.
[02:09:31.934 --> 02:09:32.874]  Okay, we'll talk to the crew.
[02:09:32.894 --> 02:09:33.874]  We can do both, probably.
[02:09:34.114 --> 02:09:34.595]  Let's do both.
[02:09:34.655 --> 02:09:38.495]   So let's just say Crew come in at about 10 a.m.
[02:09:38.535 --> 02:09:39.656]  Let's say tomorrow at noon.
[02:09:40.576 --> 02:09:41.017]  Yeah, that works.
[02:09:41.157 --> 02:09:42.998]  Let's tape commercial free for like an hour and a half.
[02:09:43.138 --> 02:09:43.238]  Okay.
[02:09:43.258 --> 02:09:46.000]  So you can really just get all this out because here's the bottom line.
[02:09:47.722 --> 02:09:52.505]  Where we're at currently, what are your final statements to the viewers and listeners that need to know?
[02:09:52.525 --> 02:09:53.806]  Well, everyone needs to get active.
[02:09:54.326 --> 02:09:58.449]  And we're at, like I said, I've said this repeatedly, this is fifth generation warfare.
[02:09:58.709 --> 02:10:02.632]  We're at a critical turning point in human history and we're all living through it.
[02:10:03.052 --> 02:10:05.194]  The COVID narrative was BS.
[02:10:05.674 --> 02:10:07.535]  The jabs are hurting people.
[02:10:07.795 --> 02:10:09.637]  The government is lying to us about these things.
[02:10:10.777 --> 02:10:16.522]  I know that many of you probably do not hold any value about contacting your representatives or elected officials.
[02:10:16.762 --> 02:10:18.163]  You need to get politically active.
[02:10:18.583 --> 02:10:19.263]  Send them an email.
[02:10:19.324 --> 02:10:20.344]  Oh, most of them don't know.
[02:10:21.225 --> 02:10:21.725]  What do you mean?
[02:10:21.945 --> 02:10:22.886]  I'd love to say they're evil.
[02:10:22.926 --> 02:10:24.047]  Most of them, like you said, don't know.
[02:10:24.707 --> 02:10:26.489]  They're easily woken up.
[02:10:26.529 --> 02:10:27.009]  I agree with you.
[02:10:27.709 --> 02:10:29.471]  Most of these representatives don't even know what's going on.
[02:10:29.531 --> 02:10:31.072]  Well, no, but they need to start hearing from your audience.
[02:10:31.092 --> 02:10:31.692]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:10:31.732 --> 02:10:33.153]  They're not already done, folks.
[02:10:33.193 --> 02:10:33.714]  I agree with you.
[02:10:34.014 --> 02:10:34.955]  I'm saying they're ready to hear.
[02:10:35.902 --> 02:10:37.962]  Well, I hope that they're ready to hear.
[02:10:39.083 --> 02:10:44.144]  I think the next couple weeks will be real telling whether or not the Uniparty is going to go away and the Republicans are actually going to do something.
[02:10:44.184 --> 02:10:45.624]  I sure hope that they actually get these committees.
[02:10:45.644 --> 02:10:47.085]  You're calling for a criminal investigation?
[02:10:47.205 --> 02:10:48.665]  Well, I think I'm calling for a number of things.
[02:10:48.685 --> 02:10:49.865]  I want Congress to investigate.
[02:10:49.905 --> 02:10:52.266]  I want to see an investigation both on the Senate and the House side.
[02:10:52.706 --> 02:10:52.946]  Okay?
[02:10:52.966 --> 02:10:54.726]  And I want to see criminal referrals from Congress.
[02:10:54.746 --> 02:10:58.447]  And I'd like to see the executive branch of the government do an investigation, but that's not going to happen.
[02:10:58.467 --> 02:11:00.848]  But Searsdale, you're not a mad scientist.
[02:11:00.868 --> 02:11:01.548]  You're a scientist.
[02:11:01.568 --> 02:11:02.308]  You're what they really fear.
[02:11:02.808 --> 02:11:04.789]  Well, that's why they came after me so hard.
[02:11:05.369 --> 02:11:17.376]  And the other thing that's going on right now is that in the state of Florida, DeSantis has created a committee or investigations to actually look at what's happening and potentially refer criminal charges.
[02:11:17.436 --> 02:11:21.038]  I believe the grand jury has convened related to some of these issues.
[02:11:21.418 --> 02:11:25.780]  So if the federal government's not going to do it, at least get in contact with your state representatives as well.
[02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:27.781]  Put pressure on your attorney general.
[02:11:28.061 --> 02:11:30.263]  We need to have charges brought against these people.
[02:11:30.303 --> 02:11:30.903]  They are criminals.
[02:11:31.643 --> 02:11:34.765]  What they're doing is the most... And we're not pissing in the wind here.
[02:11:35.285 --> 02:11:38.606]  All over the world and here, Japan, Europe, it's happening.
[02:11:38.746 --> 02:11:47.310]  I mean, we're, you know... It is, and the funny thing here is, this past week I was watching the World Economic Foundation... Hold on, that's where I wanted to go next.
[02:11:47.690 --> 02:11:53.673]  So tomorrow, be here at 11, we'll tape at noon for an hour and a half, commercial free, we'll air at about 4pm tomorrow.
[02:11:54.013 --> 02:11:56.774]  Let's reconvene on how we go after him, how we stop him next.
[02:11:57.234 --> 02:11:57.534]  Sounds good.
[02:11:57.554 --> 02:11:58.955]  Drew, you ready to come into work tomorrow?
[02:12:01.035 --> 02:12:01.475]  Yes, sir.
[02:12:01.875 --> 02:12:02.596]  All right, I'll be here.
[02:12:02.836 --> 02:12:03.576]  All right, sounds good, sir.
[02:12:04.277 --> 02:12:04.617]  All right.
[02:12:04.757 --> 02:12:06.498]  I was going to take my daughter fishing, but she can wait.
[02:12:07.018 --> 02:12:10.560]  All right, because she'll be dead if we don't stop this, so I kind of got to be here.
[02:12:10.580 --> 02:12:13.482]  All right, we'll be right back with Judge Andrew Napolitano, hour number four.
[02:12:14.042 --> 02:12:14.942]  Amazing Job!
[02:12:14.762 --> 02:12:21.762]  The Truth About Wuhan, the new book by Dr. Andrew G. Huff.
[02:12:21.762 --> 02:12:36.762]  Here's what you can expect at Davos this year.
[02:12:37.498 --> 02:12:42.900]  Where our unelected overlord, Klaus Schwab, asks this very important question.
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:45.660]  What does it mean to master the future?
[02:12:46.181 --> 02:12:51.002]  This year's annual meeting takes place amid a global cost-of-living crisis.
[02:12:51.622 --> 02:12:54.663]  And during Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.
[02:12:55.782 --> 02:13:12.592]  By bringing the planet's politicians, business and civil leaders together in the same building, the meeting offers a key opportunity, like the clear and present danger of disinformation panel discussion, led by former CNN Arbiter of Truth, Brian Stelter.
[02:13:13.172 --> 02:13:15.494]  I leave CNN and I was arrested by military police.
[02:13:15.919 --> 02:13:20.241]  Brian recently had a run-in with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:13:20.682 --> 02:13:23.603]  Here's how it went down.
[02:13:23.923 --> 02:13:25.324]  There's nothing you can do!
[02:13:25.604 --> 02:13:27.245]  We're gonna rape your body!
[02:13:27.485 --> 02:13:28.586]  Rape your medical rights!
[02:13:28.666 --> 02:13:30.007]  Rape your children's minds!
[02:13:30.247 --> 02:13:31.688]  We're gonna ship-sink the land!
[02:13:31.728 --> 02:13:33.589]  We're gonna destroy every facet!
[02:13:33.729 --> 02:13:34.769]  Hollywood rules!
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:44.002]  Economic growth increasingly depends on building a green global economy.
[02:13:44.482 --> 02:13:50.304]  At Davos, the First Movers Coalition will convene to discuss progress towards this goal.
[02:13:50.624 --> 02:14:02.549]  It's a group of 65 companies working to decarbonize the sectors responsible for 30% of global emissions, including heavy industry and long-distance transport.
[02:14:03.169 --> 02:14:05.310]  To follow the annual meeting 2023, visit our website.
[02:14:07.671 --> 02:14:13.394]  Working towards a safe and secure society, I'm the Tyrannical Lisp.
[02:14:16.275 --> 02:14:18.855]  (upbeat music)
[02:14:18.855 --> 02:14:35.235]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:14:35.235 --> 02:14:41.814]  (upbeat music)
[02:14:41.814 --> 02:14:44.395]  (upbeat music)
[02:14:44.395 --> 02:14:46.974]  (upbeat music)
[02:14:46.984 --> 02:14:51.286]  Info Wars has been banned.
[02:14:51.386 --> 02:14:51.726]  Arrested.
[02:14:51.847 --> 02:14:58.189]  Attacked and threatened.
[02:14:58.249 --> 02:14:59.730]  Because we are effective.
[02:15:01.369 --> 02:15:02.729]  The Great Awakening is here.
[02:15:03.190 --> 02:15:04.850]  Go to band.video.
[02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:07.671]  Download the videos and share.
[02:15:09.591 --> 02:15:13.912]  Support The Information War at infowarstore.com.
[02:15:16.733 --> 02:15:18.733]  And never give up the fight.
[02:15:18.733 --> 02:15:20.733]  Fight.
[02:15:20.733 --> 02:15:27.733]  [Music]
[02:15:27.733 --> 02:15:35.733]   InfoWars.com So I had a distant relative suffering from seizures.
[02:15:35.733 --> 02:15:39.733]  And they called me and asked me, "What should we get?"
[02:15:40.035 --> 02:15:48.220]  And I said, look, you should try CBD because CBDA has this effect with people and, you know, anti-seizure effects.
[02:15:48.620 --> 02:15:49.580]  And I said, you got to try this.
[02:15:49.620 --> 02:15:54.883]  So I bought on your store two vials of your CBD 1000 milligrams.
[02:15:55.324 --> 02:15:57.665]  I couldn't believe the price that you had.
[02:15:57.685 --> 02:15:59.306]  It was so low.
[02:15:59.506 --> 02:16:04.709]  I mean, the value of that, if people know this industry, the price is very, very good.
[02:16:05.389 --> 02:16:07.250]  I sent a bottle to my family member.
[02:16:07.410 --> 02:16:08.511]  I kept the bottle for myself.
[02:16:09.091 --> 02:16:12.933]  And then my family member was using it, having amazing results.
[02:16:12.953 --> 02:16:14.154]  I sent a bottle.
[02:16:14.894 --> 02:16:25.980]  Well, my lab director was working on a new method to quantitate cannabinoids, about 10 or 12 of them, using a single four-minute method on an LC-MS instrument, a mass spec instrument.
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:30.842]  And she asked me, hey, do you have a sample of CBD oil that we can test on this method?
[02:16:31.142 --> 02:16:32.403]  And I said, okay, sure.
[02:16:32.743 --> 02:16:34.404]  So I gave her a sample blind.
[02:16:35.104 --> 02:16:37.926]  She didn't know it was Infowars or any brand or anything.
[02:16:37.966 --> 02:16:38.846]  Gave it to her blind.
[02:16:39.386 --> 02:16:42.628]  She ran the sample, got the results, and, wow, this is a full profile.
[02:16:42.648 --> 02:16:43.469]  It's a full spectrum.
[02:16:43.689 --> 02:16:44.769]  It's got CBD-A in it.
[02:16:44.829 --> 02:16:46.170]  I said, yeah, of course it does.
[02:16:46.550 --> 02:16:47.351]  It's got CBD.
[02:16:47.651 --> 02:16:49.912]  And it's, you know, super, super low THC.
[02:16:50.152 --> 02:16:51.993]  We have tests for Delta-9 and all that stuff.
[02:16:52.593 --> 02:16:56.756]  And I asked her, I said, okay, you've tested about 100 CBD products.
[02:16:57.236 --> 02:17:01.218]  What do you think this product would cost in the marketplace, just looking at the lab results?
[02:17:01.658 --> 02:17:01.958]  She said, $150.
[02:17:04.173 --> 02:17:06.354]  You know, in the same volume that you have.
[02:17:06.374 --> 02:17:07.655]  I just looked at your store.
[02:17:08.115 --> 02:17:12.578]  This is, I think, $67 or $68 on InfoWars store.
[02:17:13.839 --> 02:17:22.824]  No joke, Alex, and you didn't ask me to talk about this, but I gotta tell you, just independently, this CBD product that you have is an outstanding value.
[02:17:22.964 --> 02:17:23.504]  It's outstanding.
[02:17:23.544 --> 02:17:27.527]  I'm taking it myself, and it's helping my family members, so I just wanna put that on the record.
[02:17:27.587 --> 02:17:28.187]  It's the real deal.
[02:17:28.327 --> 02:17:29.688]  Well, I appreciate that.
[02:17:29.728 --> 02:17:30.508]  I didn't know that happened.
[02:17:30.548 --> 02:17:33.210]  I mean, here's all that happened with the InfoWars MD line.
[02:17:33.906 --> 02:17:39.530]  We went out looking for new suppliers because we were getting blocked everywhere and having issues getting the stuff we wanted, as you know, with supply chain breakdowns.
[02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:46.154]  We ran into two big companies that are listeners, and this particular company said, we have over 50 products, most of them are already top sellers.
[02:17:46.634 --> 02:17:48.235]  And I said, well, what do you think your best products are?
[02:17:48.275 --> 02:17:53.479]  They said, well, this is wide-spectrum CBD that we sell under a couple different names in stores and at medical clinics for about $120 to $150.
[02:17:53.318 --> 02:17:59.958]   for about $120 to $150. We recommend you sell it for $100 and we got to buy it for like $30.
[02:17:59.958 --> 02:18:03.318]   And I just said, no, we're going to double our monies enough.
[02:18:03.506 --> 02:18:09.190]  So yes, this is $100 to $120, especially the thousand milligram one, CBD for about half the price.
[02:18:09.250 --> 02:18:10.451]  And so you nailed it.
[02:18:10.531 --> 02:18:10.931]  Absolutely.
[02:18:10.951 --> 02:18:12.893]  Because I'm not a big top tester like you, an expert.
[02:18:12.973 --> 02:18:14.714]  I just go out and say, what's top rated?
[02:18:14.734 --> 02:18:15.835]  Who's already got the best test?
[02:18:16.155 --> 02:18:16.715]  Who is that?
[02:18:16.796 --> 02:18:18.837]  And then that way we know it's already built in that it's quality.
[02:18:18.857 --> 02:18:19.898]  So thank you for the support.
[02:18:20.318 --> 02:18:21.759]  It has to be processed correctly.
[02:18:21.779 --> 02:18:25.402]  And whoever you're using as your source, they know how to do that to maintain it.
[02:18:25.482 --> 02:18:27.684]  So it keeps all those molecules in their form.
[02:18:27.984 --> 02:18:29.405]  CBD is very delicate.
[02:18:29.949 --> 02:18:31.284]  And it can be destroyed through heat.
[02:18:36.061 --> 02:18:43.544]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[02:18:44.044 --> 02:18:58.149]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[02:18:58.589 --> 02:19:02.150]  Transdimensionally, over-the-space-time continuums are false, that says.
[02:19:02.410 --> 02:19:06.513]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[02:19:06.733 --> 02:19:10.775]  What we envisioned a hundred years ago, twenty years ago, is now reality.
[02:19:11.536 --> 02:19:27.645]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[02:19:27.865 --> 02:19:28.586]  InfoWars.
[02:19:28.946 --> 02:19:29.826]  Tomorrow's News.
[02:19:30.127 --> 02:19:30.447]  Today.
[02:19:31.027 --> 02:19:34.890]  Well, I haven't seen this guy since I was on The View in person.
[02:19:34.930 --> 02:19:36.551]  He's been on many times on his show.
[02:19:37.509 --> 02:19:39.690]  I was on The View in like 2006.
[02:19:40.151 --> 02:19:41.151]  I went to New York.
[02:19:41.211 --> 02:19:41.932]  I was on Fox.
[02:19:42.012 --> 02:19:42.572]  I was on CNN.
[02:19:42.612 --> 02:19:43.273]  I was on The View.
[02:19:43.653 --> 02:19:44.373]  We went and got lunch.
[02:19:44.413 --> 02:19:45.094]  It was amazing.
[02:19:45.534 --> 02:19:48.236]  And when everybody was scared to have me on at Fox, they said, oh, you're banned.
[02:19:48.296 --> 02:19:50.937]  Judge Andrew Napolitano would have me on.
[02:19:51.037 --> 02:19:55.700]  And I remember him six-plus years ago saying, intelligence agencies are censoring.
[02:19:56.021 --> 02:19:57.281]  They've hijacked the government.
[02:19:57.341 --> 02:19:59.242]  They're spying on the president.
[02:19:59.523 --> 02:20:02.124]  And we were seeing some of the same documents, but he had sources in MI6.
[02:20:03.144 --> 02:20:08.744]   And as soon as he did that, he went from being like the number two guy at Fox to they just were slowly killing him
[02:20:08.744 --> 02:20:11.944]   for the next few years before they got rid of him. I didn't want to talk about spilt milk.
[02:20:11.944 --> 02:20:17.743]   It's just that you have paid a big price for not toeing the line and you have been vindicated.
[02:20:17.743 --> 02:20:20.843]  Wow, Elon Musk, incredible what's happening there.
[02:20:20.843 --> 02:20:23.944]   You want to talk about FBI Director Ray Damos? We've got the clip.
[02:20:23.944 --> 02:20:30.343]   FBI and personal liberty, Biden saying he has no regrets, how insane all this is.
[02:20:30.343 --> 02:20:35.644]   Judge, you've got a fountain of youth. I look since I haven't seen you in person,
[02:20:35.644 --> 02:20:42.244]   50 years older and you look 10 years younger. What in the hell are you taking?
[02:20:42.329 --> 02:20:48.651]  Well, I eat right, I exercise regularly, I sleep well, and it's worked out okay.
[02:20:48.751 --> 02:20:50.031]  You're doing, I'm serious, you're doing good.
[02:20:50.332 --> 02:20:53.673]  You didn't look bad then, but you look even better now, so I'm a little bit envious right now.
[02:20:54.033 --> 02:20:57.396]  So I'm going to try to shut up or you'll never get a chance to talk.
[02:20:58.356 --> 02:21:00.018]  Last month on your show, I was good and let you talk.
[02:21:00.038 --> 02:21:01.499]  I just wanted to hear what you had to say.
[02:21:01.519 --> 02:21:02.900]  What do you want to dive into first?
[02:21:02.920 --> 02:21:08.404]  I want to get into Davos and Ray, but they're saying New World Order's in trouble and everybody's turning against them.
[02:21:08.424 --> 02:21:11.987]  I go to YouTube or Twitter, like 99% of the comments are negative.
[02:21:12.368 --> 02:21:14.009]  Doesn't seem like the New World Order's going too well.
[02:21:14.249 --> 02:21:18.931]  The FBI has become a dangerous domestic surveillance organization.
[02:21:20.412 --> 02:21:24.814]  It used to be in the business of fighting crime, now it's in the business of predicting crime.
[02:21:25.514 --> 02:21:29.736]  And it engages in the predicting of crime by surveilling everything that we do.
[02:21:29.856 --> 02:21:41.502]  Every keystroke on every mobile device and every desktop, phone conversations, fiber optic data transferred into, out of, and within the United States.
[02:21:42.102 --> 02:21:43.123]  You think I'm making this up?
[02:21:43.863 --> 02:21:57.586]  Last week, the FBI revealed the 906-page report, which was prepared in the Trump administration, so that's under Bill Barr and Chris Wray, telling FBI agents how to use intelligence sources to do spying for them.
[02:21:57.946 --> 02:22:05.908]  The FBI is supposed to use the Fourth Amendment, which means you gather information, you gather probable cause, you present it to a judge.
[02:22:06.048 --> 02:22:08.269]  If the judge agrees, the judge signs a search warrant.
[02:22:08.289 --> 02:22:12.790]  This is what they did to Donald Trump, and this is what they do every day of the week.
[02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:22.212]  But when the FBI is impatient or doesn't have probable cause but wants to know what people are doing anyway, it goes to its friends in the intelligence community.
[02:22:22.432 --> 02:22:23.172]  Don't believe me?
[02:22:23.272 --> 02:22:25.732]  Google the 906-page report.
[02:22:26.252 --> 02:22:38.855]  What's startling, Alex, is that this is the first time the FBI has admitted in writing its collective antipathy to the right to privacy and its collective rejection of the Fourth Amendment.
[02:22:39.577 --> 02:22:45.045]  On top of all that, we find out yesterday that FBI Director Chris Wray, where is he?
[02:22:45.646 --> 02:22:46.728]  Davos, Switzerland.
[02:22:47.229 --> 02:22:54.699]  Talking to all the globalists and super bankers of the world who would love to control us, here's what Chris Wray said.
[02:22:55.812 --> 02:23:11.447]  I think the sophistication of the private sector is improving, and particularly important, the level of collaboration between the private sector and the government, especially the FBI, has, I think, made significant strides.
[02:23:11.847 --> 02:23:21.096]  Pretty much every technology we could talk about today, we see both great opportunity, but great dangers in the wrong hand.
[02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:24.923]  It's already in the wrong hands because it's in the FBI's hands.
[02:23:25.403 --> 02:23:35.631]  So the FBI is now acknowledging at an international forum on international television that it regularly collaborates with Big Tech in order to spy on us.
[02:23:36.092 --> 02:23:40.275]  So you may think you're dealing with Big Tech, but you're really dealing with Big Brother.
[02:23:40.535 --> 02:23:46.144]  And I love how the Twitter files, what Elon Musk has done, has forced him to go from denying this.
[02:23:46.184 --> 02:23:49.449]  I've seen congressional hearings a few years ago where he denies they're even spying.
[02:23:49.889 --> 02:23:52.453]  Like, yeah, there's a pipeline, we're dialed into it, that's the way it is.
[02:23:54.076 --> 02:23:55.358]  This doesn't look good.
[02:23:55.678 --> 02:23:56.539]  No, it doesn't look good.
[02:23:56.599 --> 02:23:59.362]  And I'll tell you another interesting story about denial.
[02:23:59.542 --> 02:24:02.946]  The FBI purchased Israeli software called ZeroClick.
[02:24:03.407 --> 02:24:17.121]  ZeroClick does not require that you be tricked into clicking onto a link in order for the government to gain access to the information in your laptop or your desktop or your mobile device.
[02:24:17.561 --> 02:24:22.561]   they gain the information automatically. Joe Biden, to his credit, when he learned that the FBI
[02:24:22.561 --> 02:24:29.721]   bought ZeroClick, ordered that they not use it and ordered that the company that sold it to the FBI not be
[02:24:29.721 --> 02:24:34.601]   permitted to sell anything to the government. So just if something's in your browser
[02:24:34.601 --> 02:24:38.002]   and a pop-up pops up, we've all had that happen where you're like
[02:24:38.002 --> 02:24:40.721]   randomly searching something and some horrible thing pops up.
[02:24:40.901 --> 02:24:43.043]  Now you didn't click on it, but you're guilty.
[02:24:43.243 --> 02:24:43.603]  Correct.
[02:24:43.644 --> 02:24:47.687]  You don't have to click on it for them to gain access to it.
[02:24:47.727 --> 02:24:57.197]  When Chris Wray was asked about this by the Senate Intelligence Committee, a very liberal senator, but he's great on civil liberties, Ron Wyden from Oregon.
[02:24:57.657 --> 02:25:00.919]  He said to Senator Wyden, well, we didn't buy it to use it.
[02:25:00.979 --> 02:25:03.861]  We bought it to see how it works in case the bad guys use it.
[02:25:04.061 --> 02:25:05.082]  Well, that is absurd.
[02:25:05.182 --> 02:25:06.023]  Nobody believes it.
[02:25:06.063 --> 02:25:07.644]  The FBI bought it to use it.
[02:25:07.904 --> 02:25:10.225]  Even Joe Biden didn't believe him when he said that.
[02:25:10.245 --> 02:25:17.951]  And now we know through through WikiLeaks 2.0, Elon Musk, that they were coordinating in the election.
[02:25:17.991 --> 02:25:26.596]  They were blocking, not the Senator Biden's laptop, but questions about the Afghan withdrawal and the Russia war and Ukraine and lockdowns.
[02:25:26.656 --> 02:25:31.200]   I mean, This seems like a thousand times worse than anything Nixon even dreamed about.
[02:25:31.241 --> 02:25:32.021]  It absolutely is.
[02:25:32.342 --> 02:25:42.671]  The three-letter entities that we all fear, you know, FBI, DEA, DHS, are all in a symbiotic relationship.
[02:25:43.392 --> 02:25:45.854]  Symbiotic relationship with big tech.
[02:25:46.175 --> 02:25:49.598]  Big tech benefits, FBI benefits.
[02:25:49.858 --> 02:25:51.259]  And there's a danger to big tech.
[02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:55.502]  The FBI cannot suppress speech on the basis of its content.
[02:25:55.703 --> 02:25:56.583]  Big Tech can.
[02:25:57.204 --> 02:26:05.549]  But if Big Tech is doing the government's bidding, then the First Amendment will be applied to Big Tech, and they will lose the privacy rights of their bulletin board.
[02:26:05.569 --> 02:26:06.049]  They don't know it.
[02:26:06.390 --> 02:26:16.717]  In the case of Twitter, it's profoundly unfair, because these crimes were committed by the old Twitter, the Jack Dorsey Twitter, but the Twitter that will be punished is the new Twitter, which is the Elon Musk Twitter.
[02:26:16.737 --> 02:26:21.260]  Well, that's why when Elon Musk said, I'm not restoring Alex Jones, there's a level of demonization I've been through, I kind of said, I get it.
[02:26:21.980 --> 02:26:26.543]  I'm not saying I defend it, but they're having the EU threaten to arrest him now.
[02:26:26.643 --> 02:26:28.705]  I mean, like, he's done some bold stuff.
[02:26:28.745 --> 02:26:29.665]  What do you think of Musk?
[02:26:31.427 --> 02:26:35.369]  I'm a little disappointed in Musk because he continues to suppress people like you.
[02:26:35.389 --> 02:26:39.933]  I mean, if he's going to run the public square, it should be an open public square.
[02:26:39.993 --> 02:26:41.173]  I get it and I agree with you.
[02:26:41.233 --> 02:26:43.835]  Nobody is suppressed because of the content of their speech.
[02:26:43.955 --> 02:26:46.117]  But why do you think he's doing what he's doing then?
[02:26:47.290 --> 02:26:52.902]  I don't know why he's doing it to you, Alex, but I do commend him for revealing what he's revealed.
[02:26:52.942 --> 02:26:53.403]  That's my point.
[02:26:53.483 --> 02:26:54.765]  Why is he going against the deep state?
[02:26:56.055 --> 02:26:59.236]  Well, he promised that he would, and he truly believes in the freedom of speech.
[02:26:59.276 --> 02:26:59.696]  I wish he would.
[02:26:59.716 --> 02:27:00.737]  Sure, so, you know, I get it.
[02:27:00.757 --> 02:27:01.397]  That's what I meant.
[02:27:01.457 --> 02:27:10.700]  I'm kind of like, win the war, lose the battle, and I'm not trying to, like, just defend him in some social Stockholm Syndrome thing.
[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:15.002]  I don't like it, but I'm saying, I can't really bitch when they're definitely scared.
[02:27:15.042 --> 02:27:19.724]  I mean, Soros, the Globals are throwing so much money to take his advertisers to get him.
[02:27:19.964 --> 02:27:20.404]  Well, they...
[02:27:21.624 --> 02:27:48.034]   Elon Musk has revealed, as well as a lawsuit brought by 16 State Attorneys General in New Orleans and Federal Court in New Orleans against DHS, the discovery in that case has revealed a relationship between DHS, Department of Homeland Security, between DHS and DEA and BATF and Big Tech In which they were doing Big Tech's bidding.
[02:27:48.074 --> 02:27:53.858]  So Big Tech is told, we need you to suppress this information.
[02:27:53.918 --> 02:27:55.438]  We want Joe Biden to win.
[02:27:55.719 --> 02:27:58.240]  We want you to suppress the pro-Trump information.
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:01.022]  So I'm not a famous judge like you, but I'm a layman, I'm telling you I'm right.
[02:28:01.662 --> 02:28:08.506]  They can argue section 203 and say all this stuff, but when the government is telling you to censor somebody, that's illegal.
[02:28:09.904 --> 02:28:22.413]  It is not criminal, but it is wrong because it is an abuse of power by the government, and it will cause Big Tech to lose its privacy rights, its control of its own private property.
[02:28:22.453 --> 02:28:23.594]  Sure, so what is the mechanism?
[02:28:23.614 --> 02:28:37.464]  If it violates the Fourth Amendment, then... You have to bring a lawsuit, and you have to get a judge to say, okay, you no longer can suppress anybody's speech on the basis of content, because the First Amendment now applies to you, even though you're a private entity.
[02:28:37.964 --> 02:28:41.345]  I just love how they deny they were always doing it to Congress and now they're calling.
[02:28:41.705 --> 02:28:42.745]  They go, of course we do that!
[02:28:43.185 --> 02:28:45.506]  Remember, Ray was like two weeks ago, of course we do that!
[02:28:45.666 --> 02:28:55.029]  Well, what Ray just admitted in the clip that we just ran should send chills through the backbone of everybody who believes that the Fourth Amendment means what it says.
[02:28:55.109 --> 02:28:57.869]  And notice the sitcom at the end, we gotta keep this in our hands.
[02:28:58.389 --> 02:28:58.569]  Right.
[02:28:58.589 --> 02:29:00.650]  That's what every authoritarian says.
[02:29:00.690 --> 02:29:03.511]  We're not for authoritarianism, but we're gonna use it for everybody's safety.
[02:29:03.531 --> 02:29:03.991]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:05.114 --> 02:29:14.262]  All right, Judge Andrew Napolitano, an icon of American liberty and freedom, who isn't swayed by left or right, but what's right, is here with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:29:14.342 --> 02:29:18.906]  Then Owen Shroyer takes over in 40 minutes for The War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:29:19.386 --> 02:29:20.868]  Central here at mpoolwars.com.
[02:29:21.068 --> 02:29:26.332]  So Judge, I've got my questions, but I want you to be able to take over with... Start with your questions.
[02:29:26.633 --> 02:29:27.754]  I'm so happy to be here.
[02:29:28.334 --> 02:29:32.398]  I love being on your show, but being here in Austin with you, terrific.
[02:29:33.178 --> 02:29:35.619]  Are you optimistic about humanity?
[02:29:35.699 --> 02:29:37.360]  Are we starting to turn the page?
[02:29:37.780 --> 02:29:40.502]  Have we forced the deep state out of the open or are we really losing?
[02:29:40.882 --> 02:29:44.043]  What do you make of the Debo script admitting we want to censor Americans?
[02:29:44.063 --> 02:29:48.285]  The deputy head of the EU unelected bureau saying that two days ago.
[02:29:49.106 --> 02:29:52.988]  Just all these statements about world government, new world order, we're saving you.
[02:29:53.408 --> 02:29:56.249]  It's like we're extraterrestrials that are going to save Earth.
[02:29:56.289 --> 02:29:58.731]  That's John Kerry two days ago.
[02:29:59.751 --> 02:30:01.132]  Really, you're a smart guy.
[02:30:01.232 --> 02:30:02.553]  What is your gut level about it?
[02:30:02.573 --> 02:30:04.094]  This is a football game where we are.
[02:30:04.414 --> 02:30:06.435]  Are we in the second quarter, the third, the fourth?
[02:30:06.896 --> 02:30:07.676]  Is the game over?
[02:30:07.736 --> 02:30:08.437]  Are we winning?
[02:30:08.877 --> 02:30:09.137]  What is it?
[02:30:09.437 --> 02:30:11.979]  I'm sorry to say I'm not optimistic, Alex.
[02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:17.903]  I think that the United States of America, the federal government, will collapse of its own weight.
[02:30:17.943 --> 02:30:19.344]  It won't be able to pay its bills.
[02:30:19.424 --> 02:30:22.466]  No one will want to work for it, just like the old Soviet Union.
[02:30:23.385 --> 02:30:25.385]  So their hubris has taken us there.
[02:30:25.385 --> 02:30:32.585]   Yes, and the country will break apart into a dozen or a half dozen or maybe more republics.
[02:30:32.585 --> 02:30:37.625]   Down here in Texas, there'll be a lot more freedom than where I live in the Northeast.
[02:30:37.625 --> 02:30:40.825]   But you'll be able to vote with your feet as Ronald Reagan used to say and go where
[02:30:40.825 --> 02:30:41.825]  you want to live.
[02:30:41.825 --> 02:30:43.545]  But there'll be no federal government.
[02:30:43.545 --> 02:30:47.865]   There'll be no Chuck Schumers and Nancy Pelosi's and even Kevin McCarthy's.
[02:30:47.865 --> 02:30:50.064]  As far as I'm concerned, it's the same party.
[02:30:50.064 --> 02:30:53.825]   It's the same big government party with a Republican wing and a Democrat wing.
[02:30:53.825 --> 02:30:55.625]  But that crowd won't be around anymore.
[02:30:55.587 --> 02:31:00.450]  Government will be smaller and more local and more responsive to the people.
[02:31:00.470 --> 02:31:02.752]  There'll be a fallout, of course, for that.
[02:31:04.212 --> 02:31:05.413]  I don't know when this is going to happen.
[02:31:05.433 --> 02:31:06.594]  I was about to say, what's the timeline?
[02:31:07.534 --> 02:31:09.135]  I don't think it's going to happen in my lifetime.
[02:31:09.195 --> 02:31:10.116]  It may happen in yours.
[02:31:10.176 --> 02:31:12.718]  It'll happen in the lifetime of your children and your grandchildren.
[02:31:12.758 --> 02:31:15.460]  So the next 25, 30, or 40 years.
[02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:16.901]  We can't keep going on like this.
[02:31:16.941 --> 02:31:19.744]  We're close to $32 trillion in debt.
[02:31:19.844 --> 02:31:22.266]  Pretty soon, the dollars in your pocket will be worthless.
[02:31:22.286 --> 02:31:24.267]  Saudi Arabia is moving away from the petrodollar.
[02:31:24.628 --> 02:31:24.808]  Right.
[02:31:25.228 --> 02:31:27.810]  Actually, pretty soon, you won't even have dollars in your pocket.
[02:31:27.890 --> 02:31:30.933]  Everything will be digital, and the Feds will be able to control everything.
[02:31:30.993 --> 02:31:35.016]  And at some point, their control will collapse like a house of cards.
[02:31:36.783 --> 02:31:37.225]  What do you think?
[02:31:37.807 --> 02:31:38.650]  I agree with that statement.
[02:31:40.816 --> 02:31:41.896]  I just don't know what to do.
[02:31:42.236 --> 02:31:49.419]  Well, it just seems to be getting worse because the government doesn't care about the Constitution it has sworn to uphold.
[02:31:49.979 --> 02:31:54.740]  Its absolute mania for spying on us is out of control.
[02:31:55.701 --> 02:31:57.821]  The courts won't intercede.
[02:31:58.121 --> 02:31:59.162]  The courts won't intercede.
[02:31:59.602 --> 02:32:05.624]  The Supreme Court can't even figure out who stole Sam Alito's opinion and distributed it to the press.
[02:32:05.644 --> 02:32:07.304]  And I notice they hired the Chertoff Group.
[02:32:07.324 --> 02:32:09.805]  That's like hiring the Fox to learn who killed the henhouse.
[02:32:10.714 --> 02:32:18.861]  Look, I've been very critical all day on my podcast, Judging Freedom, of John Roberts and their inability to figure out who did this.
[02:32:19.181 --> 02:32:24.166]  The people doing the investigation need subpoena power, meaning there's got to be a lawsuit or a criminal investigation.
[02:32:24.846 --> 02:32:27.709]  The court doesn't need me to tell them how to do their work.
[02:32:28.009 --> 02:32:33.213]  But without subpoena power, without the ability to put somebody under oath and ask them, how did you get your hands on this?
[02:32:33.493 --> 02:32:34.895]  Do you know who got their hands on this?
[02:32:34.935 --> 02:32:36.256]  They're never going to find out who did it.
[02:32:36.836 --> 02:32:39.338]  Which is really one branch of government piercing another.
[02:32:39.538 --> 02:32:39.899]  Correct.
[02:32:40.339 --> 02:32:40.679]  Correct.
[02:32:40.719 --> 02:32:42.561]  Someone's trying to undermine the court.
[02:32:42.621 --> 02:32:52.588]  Either someone who was worried that the weakest link in that abortion decision would leave or that the weakest link needed to be persuaded to stay.
[02:32:53.289 --> 02:32:54.610]  Someone leaked that intentionally.
[02:32:54.650 --> 02:32:56.752]  Well, the good news is it didn't really affect the court.
[02:32:56.992 --> 02:32:59.474]  No, it didn't affect the court at all.
[02:32:59.815 --> 02:33:07.962]  Roe v. Wade, or at least the parts of Roe v. Wade that regulated and liberated people to kill babies in the womb was invalidated.
[02:33:08.002 --> 02:33:09.023]  It's now up to each individual.
[02:33:09.043 --> 02:33:12.906]  Well, I'm not lionizing this court, but the establishment definitely doesn't like it.
[02:33:13.587 --> 02:33:15.729]  I think the intimidation of this court is backfiring.
[02:33:17.068 --> 02:33:21.049]  I don't think they're a happy group, to be honest with you.
[02:33:21.649 --> 02:33:22.850]  I don't know where this is going to go.
[02:33:23.110 --> 02:33:24.810]  Some good things coming down the pike.
[02:33:24.851 --> 02:33:38.355]  I wrote a piece two weeks ago called Government by Experts, in which I've excoriated the administrative state, the EPA, the FDA, all these three-letter entities that write their own rules and enforce their own rules and interpret their own rules.
[02:33:38.895 --> 02:33:41.636]  This court is about to invalidate that.
[02:33:42.156 --> 02:33:47.640]  By arguing that only the Congress can write the laws and not these various groups.
[02:33:48.261 --> 02:33:58.849]  The Bureau of Tobacco, Alcohol and Firearms tried to write a regulation saying that if you put a bump stock on a rifle, it turns the rifle into a machine gun and therefore it's unconstitutional.
[02:33:58.949 --> 02:33:59.549]  Well, exactly.
[02:33:59.569 --> 02:34:08.236]  I don't want to be too positive here, but I see them saying a year and a half ago, you can't have carbon taxes through an agency and shut down U.S.
[02:34:08.296 --> 02:34:09.417]  industry and outside law.
[02:34:10.117 --> 02:34:15.578]  I see them saying no to all these anti-gun pieces of legislation, including stuff Trump did.
[02:34:15.598 --> 02:34:26.601]  I see them just basically, I hate to say it because I'm really negative about the courts, the shining thing right now is the Supreme Court compared, it's kind of like the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[02:34:26.661 --> 02:34:31.302]  The whole purpose of an independent judiciary is to be anti-democratic.
[02:34:31.362 --> 02:34:33.442]  It is not there to reflect the will of the people.
[02:34:33.822 --> 02:34:37.983]  It is there to preserve the life, liberty, and property of the minority.
[02:34:38.223 --> 02:34:41.365]  Now you're explaining, I'm interrupting, explain a republic versus democracy.
[02:34:41.405 --> 02:34:41.925]  This is key.
[02:34:42.225 --> 02:34:44.086]  People go, Judge Apollo told us it was democracy.
[02:34:44.406 --> 02:34:47.148]  Well, yeah, 51% vote to kill all the black people, we don't do it.
[02:34:47.268 --> 02:34:47.548]  Correct.
[02:34:47.608 --> 02:34:49.589]  Or Hitler says let's kill the Jews, you don't do it.
[02:34:49.829 --> 02:34:50.249]  Explain that.
[02:34:50.390 --> 02:34:53.471]  Well, the democracy, the majority wins and the majority is right.
[02:34:53.491 --> 02:34:56.333]  The majority gets its way, no matter how horrific it may be.
[02:34:56.553 --> 02:34:58.454]  Hitler was popularly elected.
[02:34:58.834 --> 02:35:00.175]  That system was a majority.
[02:35:00.215 --> 02:35:07.298]  We have what is theoretically a republic, so that our laws are enacted by representatives rather than by the mob.
[02:35:07.358 --> 02:35:09.760]  But the representatives reflect the will of the mob.
[02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:18.124]  The Supreme Court is there to make sure that your natural rights, your rights that come from your human rights, some come from the government, they come from within us.
[02:35:18.604 --> 02:35:24.726]  Whether you believe they are a gift from God the Father or they come from us because we are the highest rational beings on the planet.
[02:35:25.126 --> 02:35:31.229]  Our rights come from within us and the court is to make sure, to make certain that the government doesn't trample those rights.
[02:35:31.829 --> 02:35:38.631]  When, this goes back a hundred years ago, to Woodrow Wilson, they created this fourth branch of government, the administrative state.
[02:35:38.951 --> 02:35:40.672]  It's not answerable to anybody.
[02:35:40.712 --> 02:35:41.913]  It writes its own laws.
[02:35:42.253 --> 02:35:43.413]  It interprets those laws.
[02:35:43.433 --> 02:35:44.614]  It enforces those laws.
[02:35:44.634 --> 02:35:45.574]  That's really the deep state.
[02:35:45.874 --> 02:35:46.234]  Correct.
[02:35:46.395 --> 02:35:49.858]  So only the courts are perfectly positioned to challenge that?
[02:35:50.018 --> 02:35:50.419]  Correct.
[02:35:50.899 --> 02:36:06.254]  And Neil Gorsuch, Justice Gorsuch, Donald Trump's first appointee to the court, has been waging a jihad against the administrative state by arguing that you are not responsive to the people, only the Congress can write the rules that you're going to write.
[02:36:06.254 --> 02:36:06.434]  Right.
[02:36:06.714 --> 02:36:10.437]  And thus far, he's persuaded the majority of the court to go along with him.
[02:36:10.457 --> 02:36:20.923]  I was about to say, so, we can be negative of Trump, and I've got big problems like you do, but, man, did these Supreme Court justices, that, that's, I mean, they're really, it's incredible.
[02:36:21.084 --> 02:36:27.288]  It has tipped the scales in favor of more fidelity to the Constitution, without question.
[02:36:27.828 --> 02:36:33.652]  It's hard for me to criticize him because I've been his friend, but he's not worthy to be President of the United States.
[02:36:34.545 --> 02:36:36.006]  Matt, do you believe that's just the ego problem?
[02:36:36.126 --> 02:36:36.366]  Yes.
[02:36:37.107 --> 02:36:38.268]  Yes, I believe the ego problem.
[02:36:38.288 --> 02:36:39.108]  Well, take the shots!
[02:36:39.609 --> 02:36:42.671]  Even CNN says the shots aren't working and he still says they're great.
[02:36:42.851 --> 02:36:44.992]  Well, he's wrong on that.
[02:36:45.012 --> 02:36:47.994]  I don't know what Fauci said to him in the back room, but he's dead wrong on that.
[02:36:48.034 --> 02:36:52.898]  I just watched your prior segment with the doctor and it was absolutely terrific.
[02:36:53.078 --> 02:36:56.961]  Trump, I think, was advised he had to do this to get re-elected.
[02:36:57.461 --> 02:37:03.044]  He had to support all the vaccines and support Fauci and support all that nonsense in order to get re-elected.
[02:37:03.284 --> 02:37:06.366]  Remember when they announced the existence of the vaccine?
[02:37:06.806 --> 02:37:08.087]  The Monday after Election Day.
[02:37:09.952 --> 02:37:13.995]  So Trump, the people that persuaded him to do what he had to do, turned on him.
[02:37:14.636 --> 02:37:15.677]  Oh absolutely, you're right.
[02:37:16.357 --> 02:37:20.621]  Look, Trump has been an enemy of the deep state, and look at what the deep state did to him.
[02:37:20.641 --> 02:37:24.203]  They made his life miserable while he was in office.
[02:37:24.704 --> 02:37:31.069]  The government spying that I talked about at Fox, which caused me the hell that you recounted.
[02:37:31.229 --> 02:37:32.230]  Hold on, let's stay there.
[02:37:32.290 --> 02:37:33.651]  This is the big one when we come back.
[02:37:34.051 --> 02:37:35.693]  Judge Andrew Napolitano in studio.
[02:37:35.713 --> 02:37:36.533]  This is amazing.
[02:37:36.573 --> 02:37:36.974]  Stay with us.
[02:37:38.234 --> 02:37:40.596]  All right, I could talk to this guy for 50 hours.
[02:37:40.657 --> 02:37:43.559]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is here in studio with us.
[02:37:43.599 --> 02:37:44.260]  What a brain.
[02:37:44.741 --> 02:37:46.562]  And I kind of feel bad asking him questions.
[02:37:46.622 --> 02:37:58.694]  I'd rather get him to give us the 35,000-foot view, because about this group, everything he said, he was being conservative, he says, not in his lifetime, maybe not mine, but my kid's lifetime, it'll collapse, which I don't want it to do.
[02:37:58.714 --> 02:38:00.716]  I want to reform it, because a collapse is going to be hellish.
[02:38:01.417 --> 02:38:03.898]  But I see when things rot, they accelerate.
[02:38:04.479 --> 02:38:05.739]  And everything's sped up nowadays.
[02:38:05.779 --> 02:38:09.981]  So I agree, if we were Rome another 100 years, I don't think we got 10 the way things are going.
[02:38:10.021 --> 02:38:15.064]  I mean, the mental illness, the crime, the decadence, just all of it.
[02:38:15.164 --> 02:38:16.325]  I see it everywhere.
[02:38:16.345 --> 02:38:18.486]  I don't know if America's got five years.
[02:38:19.306 --> 02:38:27.349]  Well, the decadence and the crime and the rot is in the government, but we accept it and we almost expect it.
[02:38:28.049 --> 02:38:36.791]   You and I, Alex... And that rolls down, though, the general... It does, but you and I, as far as I know, you and I are the only two Oh yeah, you were going to make that big point.
[02:38:37.071 --> 02:38:47.494]  We're the only two public media people now criticizing Chris Wray for what he said to this gathering of left-wing globalists in Davos, Switzerland.
[02:38:48.114 --> 02:38:55.715]  And what he said was an admission that the FBI works with private enterprise and it's dangerous.
[02:38:55.995 --> 02:38:59.516]  Yes, it's dangerous to your civil liberties, but the FBI is going to keep doing it.
[02:38:59.536 --> 02:39:01.397]  Can we run the Chris Wray clip one more time?
[02:39:01.417 --> 02:39:02.737]  Yeah, let's play that clip one more time.
[02:39:02.777 --> 02:39:03.297]  Cue that up.
[02:39:04.157 --> 02:39:05.558]  This is a big deal.
[02:39:05.598 --> 02:39:07.058]  Here it is.
[02:39:07.098 --> 02:39:22.745]  I think the sophistication of the private sector is improving, and particularly important, the level of collaboration between the private sector and the government, especially the FBI, has, I think, made significant strides.
[02:39:23.126 --> 02:39:30.609]  Pretty much every technology we could talk about today, we see both great opportunity, but great dangers.
[02:39:31.550 --> 02:39:32.390]  Uh, in the wrong hands.
[02:39:32.751 --> 02:39:34.292]  Well, it already is in the wrong hands.
[02:39:34.352 --> 02:39:35.333]  It's in the FBI hands.
[02:39:35.354 --> 02:39:41.700]  This is Donald Trump's hand-selected person to replace Jim Comey and run the FBI.
[02:39:41.740 --> 02:39:43.562]  Which I agree with you is Trump's biggest failure.
[02:39:43.662 --> 02:39:44.924]  I love hate relationship.
[02:39:44.964 --> 02:39:47.626]  He put in the worst people that were actually against him.
[02:39:47.646 --> 02:39:51.290]  But you got interrupted by the break two breaks ago, and it's not about us tooting our horn.
[02:39:51.330 --> 02:39:51.711]  It's true.
[02:39:51.831 --> 02:39:55.334]   You and I And then maybe Zero Hedge was doing some of it too.
[02:39:55.754 --> 02:39:57.115]  And believe me, I wish there was more people doing it.
[02:39:57.456 --> 02:40:06.863]  You were like, Trump's being spied on, there's a deep state, intelligence agency's done a coup, they're censoring, they're manipulating elections, and they just basically drove you out for saying that.
[02:40:07.244 --> 02:40:09.085]  Now in hindsight, complete vindication.
[02:40:09.205 --> 02:40:20.535]  Well, we learned, I had sources in the intelligence community who informed me that Trump was being spied on while he was Mr. Trump, while he was a candidate.
[02:40:21.635 --> 02:40:24.678]  And the spying was being done by British intelligence.
[02:40:24.918 --> 02:40:28.141]  When I revealed that at Fox, all hell broke loose.
[02:40:28.521 --> 02:40:37.948]  My bosses stuck with me, Rupert Murdoch stuck with me, but they dialed me back for about 10 days and then they put me back on and I didn't change my mind on anything.
[02:40:38.189 --> 02:40:54.169]   Three months later, after all hell was breaking loose, for GCHQ, that's the name of their, the initials of their intelligence entity, went to the Guardian of London and it said that judge that works for Fox in New York that everybody is dumping on, he's right!
[02:40:54.790 --> 02:40:55.230]  We did it!
[02:40:55.871 --> 02:41:00.972]  We did do the spying at the request of the Obama intelligence community.
[02:41:01.072 --> 02:41:01.933]  They didn't mention names.
[02:41:01.973 --> 02:41:03.733]  They didn't mention President Obama himself.
[02:41:04.113 --> 02:41:05.594]  We can figure out who it was.
[02:41:05.814 --> 02:41:17.077]  This was the tip of the iceberg of the deep state trying to A. Prevent Donald Trump from getting elected president and then B. Undermine his presidency and C.
[02:41:17.817 --> 02:41:26.822]  ...eventually helped Joe Biden beat him by, D, suppressing pro-Trump voices, including Trump's own in big tech.
[02:41:27.102 --> 02:41:27.802]  I totally agree.
[02:41:27.862 --> 02:41:31.444]  Everybody focuses on mail-in ballots or fraud in an election.
[02:41:31.484 --> 02:41:31.704]  No.
[02:41:32.125 --> 02:41:40.029]  As Professor Epstein exposed years before the election, with Google and all these algorithms, they can suppress stuff 30, 40 points and steal the election that way.
[02:41:40.089 --> 02:41:40.409]  Correct.
[02:41:40.669 --> 02:41:43.410]  They know what speech to suppress.
[02:41:43.471 --> 02:41:44.831]  They still suppress yours.
[02:41:45.251 --> 02:41:46.492]  They still suppress yours.
[02:41:46.512 --> 02:41:47.873]  And look at what you went through.
[02:41:48.213 --> 02:41:50.554]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:41:50.594 --> 02:41:51.995]  I'm not saying that because I like you.
[02:41:52.035 --> 02:41:53.556]  I'm saying it's because it's true.
[02:41:53.836 --> 02:41:55.837]  The state of Connecticut wrote its own rule.
[02:41:55.937 --> 02:41:58.158]  It should be called the Alex Jones Rule.
[02:41:58.618 --> 02:42:03.341]  Because in every state in the Union, the expression of an opinion is protected.
[02:42:03.661 --> 02:42:07.503]  Except in Connecticut, and except if you're Alex Jones.
[02:42:07.943 --> 02:42:13.653]   And now, They're still trying to suppress you and your voice is reaching more people than ever.
[02:42:13.994 --> 02:42:14.354]  Exactly.
[02:42:14.374 --> 02:42:16.038]  They even misrepresent what the opinion was.
[02:42:16.118 --> 02:42:17.260]  It was out of context.
[02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:17.721]  Correct.
[02:42:18.142 --> 02:42:18.423]  Correct.
[02:42:19.338 --> 02:42:21.238]  So what are they so scared of?
[02:42:21.339 --> 02:42:22.239]  I'm not just tooting our horns.
[02:42:22.279 --> 02:42:23.619]  They're scared of you, they're scared of me.
[02:42:23.779 --> 02:42:25.319]  What is it they're so scared of we're doing?
[02:42:25.480 --> 02:42:30.741]  They're scared of the truth because the truth is that the government exists to perpetuate itself.
[02:42:31.281 --> 02:42:33.041]  It doesn't exist to preserve our liberty.
[02:42:33.081 --> 02:42:34.502]  And how does it perpetuate itself?
[02:42:35.082 --> 02:42:37.543]  By taxing more and regulating more.
[02:42:37.583 --> 02:42:39.963]  By taking more property and taking more liberty.
[02:42:40.283 --> 02:42:42.244]  Over and over and over again.
[02:42:42.284 --> 02:42:43.164]  And they're doing it now.
[02:42:43.644 --> 02:42:48.147]  No matter who's in the White House or which party controls the Congress because they're the same.
[02:42:48.527 --> 02:42:49.848]  It's the big government party.
[02:42:50.128 --> 02:43:00.315]  It has a Democrat wing that likes individual welfare and war and taxes and a Republican wing that likes corporate welfare and war and deficits.
[02:43:00.335 --> 02:43:02.696]  So it doesn't sound like you have much faith in the new Congress.
[02:43:02.836 --> 02:43:03.117]  I don't.
[02:43:03.837 --> 02:43:04.177]  I don't know.
[02:43:04.197 --> 02:43:08.761]  I was cheering those 20 rebels on in the House of Representatives every day.
[02:43:08.841 --> 02:43:10.602]  Andy Biggs was on my show.
[02:43:11.063 --> 02:43:12.164]  I don't know if they collapsed.
[02:43:12.264 --> 02:43:13.865]  I don't know if they got the right concession.
[02:43:13.925 --> 02:43:15.626]  I'm sorry, Andy, I don't mean to criticize you.
[02:43:15.646 --> 02:43:16.607]  I'm your friend and fan.
[02:43:17.248 --> 02:43:19.489]  It's the congressman from Arizona that led the charge.
[02:43:20.050 --> 02:43:23.592]  I don't know what kind of concessions they got out of Kevin McCarthy.
[02:43:23.633 --> 02:43:24.793]  I think we'll find out soon.
[02:43:24.994 --> 02:43:26.555]  Are they going to raise the debt ceiling?
[02:43:26.815 --> 02:43:29.137]  Or are they going to get the Democrats to cut spending?
[02:43:31.098 --> 02:43:34.821]  Wow, there's thousands of questions I could ask, but just, what else do you want to cover?
[02:43:36.322 --> 02:43:37.403]  I don't know, what else is on the list?
[02:43:37.643 --> 02:43:40.345]  I could ask you a million questions, but let's talk about Biden.
[02:43:40.365 --> 02:43:41.526]  Let's talk about the delusion here.
[02:43:41.966 --> 02:43:49.612]  Here is the White House Press Secretary, a true clown, saying, I have, well here's Biden, there's a bunch of clips, but let's play this clip first.
[02:43:50.573 --> 02:43:54.116]  Here she is today, saying President Kamala Harris.
[02:43:54.156 --> 02:43:56.637]  Now, here's the thing, they do this every week, every day.
[02:43:57.659 --> 02:43:58.660]  They're doing it on purpose.
[02:43:58.720 --> 02:43:59.400]  Biden does it.
[02:43:59.420 --> 02:44:01.321]  So why do they keep calling her the president?
[02:44:01.721 --> 02:44:02.481]  It's not a gaffe.
[02:44:02.501 --> 02:44:02.922]  Here it is.
[02:44:04.102 --> 02:44:11.306]  This Sunday, the president will speak about the fight to secure women's fundamental right to reproductive health care in the face of these attacks.
[02:44:11.826 --> 02:44:23.072]  She will talk about what's at stake for millions of women across the country, and most importantly, the need for Congress to codify the protections of Roe into law.
[02:44:24.119 --> 02:44:27.181]  So why are they trying to blur the lines of who the president really is?
[02:44:28.242 --> 02:44:30.143]  Maybe Joe's getting ready for a surprise.
[02:44:30.323 --> 02:44:30.983]  I don't know.
[02:44:31.003 --> 02:44:34.145]  I do believe that this woman is incompetent.
[02:44:34.365 --> 02:44:36.026]  Utterly, totally incompetent.
[02:44:36.106 --> 02:44:37.667]  Even as a spokesperson for him.
[02:44:38.007 --> 02:44:44.852]  Jen Psaki really irritated libertarians and conservatives, but she competently defended Joe Biden.
[02:44:44.872 --> 02:44:46.933]  That was his press secretary for the first two years.
[02:44:46.953 --> 02:44:48.274]  She now works for MSNBC.
[02:44:48.734 --> 02:44:51.776]  Far more competent than this lady, who really doesn't know what she's talking about.
[02:44:52.136 --> 02:44:55.058]  What about Biden saying he stands by what he did?
[02:44:55.138 --> 02:44:56.138]  I've got the stack here.
[02:44:57.059 --> 02:44:57.539]  Here it is.
[02:44:58.099 --> 02:44:58.980]  I got the headlines right here.
[02:44:59.020 --> 02:44:59.640]  Give me a red shot.
[02:44:59.660 --> 02:45:00.701]  I don't want to get this wrong.
[02:45:01.021 --> 02:45:01.801]  Nothing has changed.
[02:45:01.861 --> 02:45:03.923]  Biden's still going to announce a 2024 run.
[02:45:04.423 --> 02:45:09.886]  I think Democrats are clearly trying to put pressure on him with the intel they already have with Hunter Biden and the documents.
[02:45:10.746 --> 02:45:14.789]  Defiant Biden declares he has no regrets about mishandling classified info.
[02:45:15.109 --> 02:45:17.330]  Look, if Trump did something wrong, that's an issue.
[02:45:17.370 --> 02:45:19.871]  But he wasn't even the president when he did this.
[02:45:20.111 --> 02:45:21.032]  What do you think is really going on?
[02:45:21.032 --> 02:45:25.234]  No, I do not think that the DOJ will seek the indictment of Joe Biden.
[02:45:25.254 --> 02:45:29.797]  They don't have an opinion, a legal opinion, that says you can't indict the sitting president.
[02:45:30.277 --> 02:45:32.998]  They're probably just going to whitewash this, but they will.
[02:45:34.039 --> 02:45:38.241]  They will seek the indictment of Donald Trump, and if they seek it, the grand jury will give it.
[02:45:38.721 --> 02:45:50.428]  He will be indicted for January 6th, he'll be indicted for Mar-a-Lago, and he'll be indicted by a Fulton County grand jury in Georgia for attempted interference with the election, the fake electors.
[02:45:50.828 --> 02:45:51.488]  Do you think that happens?
[02:45:52.609 --> 02:45:53.389]  Very soon.
[02:45:53.789 --> 02:45:56.290]  Like before the first half of this year is over.
[02:45:56.350 --> 02:45:57.691]  Before June of this year.
[02:45:58.071 --> 02:46:03.333]  Because they need to have trials before the 2024 presidential election.
[02:46:03.353 --> 02:46:04.714]  Some people say they'll tear the country apart.
[02:46:04.734 --> 02:46:05.334]  That's what they want.
[02:46:06.562 --> 02:46:08.604]  I don't know if it will tear the country apart.
[02:46:08.664 --> 02:46:12.247]  In my opinion, the evidence against Trump is overwhelming.
[02:46:12.307 --> 02:46:17.851]  I say that as somebody that's been his friend for 40 years, but I can't deny the evidence that's in front of me.
[02:46:19.512 --> 02:46:21.334]  Hold on, let's explain that when we come back.
[02:46:22.274 --> 02:46:24.556]  Are you talking about his companies in particular?
[02:46:24.996 --> 02:46:29.140]  No, I'm talking about Donald Trump personally involved in criminal activity.
[02:46:31.345 --> 02:46:33.586]  Alright, let's talk about that with Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[02:46:33.606 --> 02:46:36.588]  When we come back, we'll get your take on DeSantis and more.
[02:46:36.748 --> 02:46:40.050]  And then, Owen Troyer, you're going to be on the show, takes over in about 20 minutes.
[02:46:41.787 --> 02:46:45.428]  All right, final segment with Judge Andrew Napolitano, and there's a two-minute break.
[02:46:45.488 --> 02:46:51.910]  He's going to race across the hall and go with Owen Schroer, and that'll be 3 to 3.30 central.
[02:46:51.990 --> 02:46:56.611]  And then that doctor we had on, Andrew Huff, is going to be with him.
[02:46:56.631 --> 02:46:58.632]  We've got Andrew Napolitano, we've got Andrew Huff.
[02:46:59.232 --> 02:47:00.532]  What a whistleblower, how incredible.
[02:47:00.952 --> 02:47:02.893]  So Judge, you're getting into Trump.
[02:47:03.613 --> 02:47:11.718]  Why are you saying, because it's obviously politically motivated, so how can Biden commit all these crimes and his son do this and then Trump still get in trouble?
[02:47:12.138 --> 02:47:13.699]  Why are you saying you think they've got a case?
[02:47:13.799 --> 02:47:18.522]  I don't think they'll indict a sitting president because the the DOJ has the policy that they won't.
[02:47:18.582 --> 02:47:26.887]  If Joe Biden runs and is re-elected and serves the full term, the statute of limitations on his misuse of classified documents will have expired.
[02:47:27.227 --> 02:47:32.150]  There's no statute of limitations to worry about in the Trump case because they found the stuff in my...
[02:47:32.210 --> 02:47:33.390]  You're not happy about this.
[02:47:33.410 --> 02:47:34.691]  You're just saying, you look at the technicals.
[02:47:34.711 --> 02:47:36.292]  Oh, I'm not happy about any of this.
[02:47:36.332 --> 02:47:38.232]  I'm not happy about Trump being indicted.
[02:47:38.272 --> 02:47:42.054]  I'm not happy about Biden getting off scot-free.
[02:47:42.294 --> 02:47:43.774]  Why do I think they'll indict him?
[02:47:43.934 --> 02:47:46.215]  I know the federal mentality.
[02:47:46.655 --> 02:47:50.857]  That is the mentality of the people who decided to seek a search warrant.
[02:47:51.317 --> 02:47:51.957]  For his home.
[02:47:52.157 --> 02:47:57.999]  They would not have gone to that level had they not already decided to present evidence to a grand jury.
[02:47:58.039 --> 02:48:02.180]  And let's face it, a grand jury will indict a ham sandwich if the government asks it to.
[02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:05.801]  Whatever evidence they present will result in indictment.
[02:48:06.281 --> 02:48:11.023]  The same attitude pervades in the DOJ, in my opinion, with respect to January 6th.
[02:48:11.983 --> 02:48:15.205]  I've watched Trump's speech over and over and over again.
[02:48:15.225 --> 02:48:18.568]  I do not think he violated anything.
[02:48:18.748 --> 02:48:20.529]  I think it was protected by the First Amendment.
[02:48:20.549 --> 02:48:22.150]  The Feds do not view it that way.
[02:48:22.510 --> 02:48:30.556]  They view him as inciting the mob that entered the Capitol, and they will indict him for it, and he'll have to defend himself.
[02:48:30.656 --> 02:48:35.479]  It's almost surreal that he's going to get three indictments at the same time.
[02:48:35.519 --> 02:48:43.744]   The third one will be the prosecutor in Fulton County, Georgia, who will indict him with So it won't be New York with the family business?
[02:48:44.264 --> 02:48:47.045]  Well, that's a fourth one, the family business in New York.
[02:48:47.085 --> 02:48:49.206]  The family business has already been convicted.
[02:48:49.486 --> 02:48:53.428]  But as a result of that conviction, they're now investigating Trump himself.
[02:48:53.548 --> 02:48:54.649]  Sure, so let me ask you this.
[02:48:54.789 --> 02:48:56.169]  What is the political fallout?
[02:48:56.690 --> 02:48:59.531]  If they want Trump to go away, the last thing they should do is indict him.
[02:48:59.731 --> 02:49:04.836]  They may very well turn him into a hero, certainly with his base in the Republican Party.
[02:49:04.856 --> 02:49:06.437]  Well, if you and I know that, why don't they know that?
[02:49:06.557 --> 02:49:08.179]  They probably don't care.
[02:49:08.519 --> 02:49:12.622]  They're of the view that the evidence is there, and they should indict him.
[02:49:12.703 --> 02:49:18.988]  There are people in the DOJ who are not political, who just say, the evidence is here, we have to prosecute.
[02:49:19.028 --> 02:49:21.430]  Then there are others who say, here's a chance to get rid of Trump.
[02:49:21.710 --> 02:49:24.273]  If he gets convicted of this, he can't even run for dog catcher.
[02:49:24.773 --> 02:49:25.414]  And that's true.
[02:49:25.874 --> 02:49:36.724]  If he is convicted of sedition, a conspiracy to prevent the passage of power from himself to Joe Biden, under the 14th Amendment, he can't run for any public office.
[02:49:36.744 --> 02:49:37.785]  Well, they're definitely playing with fire.
[02:49:38.433 --> 02:49:42.075]  Yes, they're playing with fire because it could explode in their own hands.
[02:49:42.155 --> 02:49:46.417]  However, I don't think the Republican Party will nominate Trump.
[02:49:46.477 --> 02:49:48.398]  I think he's damaged goods, and I think they know it.
[02:49:48.518 --> 02:49:49.599]  And I think you agree with me.
[02:49:50.279 --> 02:49:51.440]  What do you think of Napolitano?
[02:49:51.800 --> 02:49:54.401]  I mean, what do you think of... He has his problems.
[02:49:54.561 --> 02:49:55.062]  No, no, no, no.
[02:49:55.082 --> 02:49:56.723]  Sorry, what do you think of DeSantis?
[02:49:57.143 --> 02:49:58.664]  What does Napolitano think of Santis?
[02:49:58.784 --> 02:50:06.268]  I think that, well, DeSantis is too big government for me as a libertarian, but the Republican side of me says he's Donald Trump without the baggage.
[02:50:07.348 --> 02:50:08.129]  Let me bring this up.
[02:50:10.672 --> 02:50:13.535]  Joe Biden, Secretary of State, announces $2.5 billion more to Ukraine.
[02:50:13.555 --> 02:50:14.316]  It's like every week.
[02:50:15.217 --> 02:50:18.160]  We've got Russian Orthodox Church issues end of the world warning.
[02:50:18.780 --> 02:50:25.988]  Head of the Russian Orthodox Church has warned that any attempt to destroy Russia by madmen trying to impose their values will lead to the end of the world.
[02:50:27.149 --> 02:50:34.074]  Your good friend and mine, Gerald Cilenti, has been saying over and over for 11 months, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:50:34.615 --> 02:50:36.496]  We have begun World War III.
[02:50:36.536 --> 02:50:41.160]  This is a surrogate war in Ukraine between Russia and the United States of America.
[02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:54.990]  Colonel Douglas MacGregor, Scott Ritter, all those no longer in the government that are not employed by CNN, are all willing to acknowledge we don't belong there, we're extending it, there's no way Putin can lose.
[02:50:55.931 --> 02:50:58.293]  Unless you want to start World War III, and I think it's beginning.
[02:50:58.593 --> 02:50:59.114]  Well, that's right.
[02:50:59.154 --> 02:51:12.485]  You follow that Pentagon-Rand Corporation ladder of threats from 1 to 40-something, or 44, and we're already like to 30 on it, and now he's calling up a million, 300,000 troops, and so the Russians don't give up.
[02:51:12.525 --> 02:51:14.787]  They always get their ass kicked up front, then they went in the air.
[02:51:14.807 --> 02:51:16.428]  A Navy SEAL was killed yesterday.
[02:51:16.548 --> 02:51:16.749]  Yeah.
[02:51:16.909 --> 02:51:17.990]  What the hell was he doing there?
[02:51:19.107 --> 02:51:22.290]  But it's such a classic Russian thing, where they lose up front, win at the end.
[02:51:22.310 --> 02:51:24.031]  It's like, it's crazy!
[02:51:24.212 --> 02:51:24.512]  Correct.
[02:51:24.552 --> 02:51:31.118]  Let's imagine, America, if you invaded the East Coast, would probably lose up front, but by the time they started getting into the South and Midwest, they'd lose.
[02:51:31.158 --> 02:51:31.758]  It's the same deal.
[02:51:31.899 --> 02:51:32.099]  Correct.
[02:51:32.119 --> 02:51:35.302]  I mean, the Russians are going to commit, commit, commit on the ladder of escalation.
[02:51:35.522 --> 02:51:36.343]  Here's my fear.
[02:51:36.943 --> 02:51:44.350]  We have 40,101st airborne in Poland, within 50 miles of the Polish-Ukraine border.
[02:51:44.790 --> 02:51:47.033]  With them are 90,000 Polish troops.
[02:51:47.914 --> 02:51:54.341]  That's 130,000 human beings ready to invade Ukraine in behalf of the U.S.
[02:51:54.401 --> 02:51:54.661]  and NATO.
[02:51:54.741 --> 02:51:57.464]  And as soon as they do it, the Russians are going to hit them with tactical nukes.
[02:51:57.504 --> 02:52:03.070]  They're going to hit them with something that's going to accelerate this into Europe's Great War like we haven't seen since World War II.
[02:52:03.331 --> 02:52:06.094]  When all else fails, Joe Biden, they take it.
[02:52:06.834 --> 02:52:12.078]  And now it's not just a possibility, it's a probability this is going to happen, according to even Henry Kissinger.
[02:52:12.458 --> 02:52:14.639]  He was against it until two days ago, now he's for it.
[02:52:14.739 --> 02:52:16.340]  What the hell is going on?
[02:52:16.440 --> 02:52:22.264]  The globalists, that's the people that Chris Wray was with in Davos, that's Tony Blinken and his Western European buddies.
[02:52:22.284 --> 02:52:22.885]  They feel insulated.
[02:52:22.945 --> 02:52:23.305]  Correct.
[02:52:23.665 --> 02:52:26.847]  The globalists believe this is their chance to get rid of Putin.
[02:52:27.287 --> 02:52:33.872]  Instead, they are strengthening the Russian economy and they are strengthening the Russian people's support of Vladimir Putin.
[02:52:35.037 --> 02:52:36.698]  So, can we avert nuclear war?
[02:52:37.198 --> 02:52:37.778]  I think so.
[02:52:38.718 --> 02:52:39.299]  I think so.
[02:52:39.499 --> 02:52:41.999]  Putin will not be first strike on nuclear war.
[02:52:42.100 --> 02:52:42.780]  Only the U.S.
[02:52:42.820 --> 02:52:45.741]  would have to do it, and there is no political will in the U.S.
[02:52:45.921 --> 02:52:49.162]  There's no political... I was about to say, will Biden send in the airborne?
[02:52:49.222 --> 02:52:50.502]  Will the Poles send in their troops?
[02:52:51.763 --> 02:52:57.505]  I hope not, but he might do it, but if he does it, it will be contrary to the political will in the United States.
[02:52:57.785 --> 02:52:59.686]  There's no political will in the United States.
[02:52:59.706 --> 02:53:01.686]  National polls almost 85% are against it.
[02:53:01.726 --> 02:53:01.967]  Correct.
[02:53:03.794 --> 02:53:07.666]  So they would have to do some sort of a false flag like FDR did with Pearl Harbor?
[02:53:12.074 --> 02:53:12.774]  I call him a dictator.
[02:53:12.794 --> 02:53:19.219]  He was elected like Hitler, but he's banned opposition, banned the oldest church, arresting people, beating them up because they're anti-war.
[02:53:19.719 --> 02:53:22.701]  Putin's doing some of that too, but I'm talking about Zelensky.
[02:53:23.442 --> 02:53:26.604]  He already did that thing into Poland and tried to blame it instantly on Russia.
[02:53:26.964 --> 02:53:31.447]  I could have said it was an accidental missile strike, but instantly he said Russia did it, attack Russia.
[02:53:31.647 --> 02:53:32.708]  It wasn't Russia.
[02:53:32.808 --> 02:53:33.869]  We all know that.
[02:53:34.229 --> 02:53:36.010]  Biden was restrained.
[02:53:36.070 --> 02:53:38.092]  NATO basically said to him, grow up.
[02:53:39.093 --> 02:53:41.736]  But NATO wants Putin out.
[02:53:42.496 --> 02:53:49.143]  And if they see an opportunity to do it, they are willing to spill the blood of young men in order to accomplish it.
[02:53:50.284 --> 02:53:55.309]  So, who's talking about this invasion anytime now?
[02:53:56.311 --> 02:53:56.972]  The next level.
[02:53:57.353 --> 02:54:08.890]  According to Colonel McGregor, a person we both know and respect, Putin has between 300,000 and 500,000 trained men ready to come in as soon as the weather is right.
[02:54:08.950 --> 02:54:11.794]  Now that could mean soon when the ground is frozen.
[02:54:12.455 --> 02:54:17.058]  Or could mean the spring when there are fewer Ukrainian soldiers.
[02:54:17.479 --> 02:54:18.059]  Eight to one.
[02:54:18.279 --> 02:54:21.622]  For every one Russian killed, eight Ukrainian soldiers are killed.
[02:54:21.922 --> 02:54:26.245]  So you wait another two or three months and the Ukrainian army is almost totally depleted.
[02:54:26.705 --> 02:54:35.213]   When General Zheluzny, the commander of the Ukraine military, Sat with President Zelensky on The Economist magazine.
[02:54:35.233 --> 02:54:36.835]  Zelensky was like this, he didn't say a word.
[02:54:37.235 --> 02:54:41.761]  Shalhoubzini said, I need 500 tanks, I need 3000 of this, I need 5000 of that.
[02:54:41.801 --> 02:54:44.264]  He was basically saying, I need a new army.
[02:54:44.905 --> 02:54:46.667]  And the West is saying, we don't have it.
[02:54:49.471 --> 02:54:49.651]  So...
[02:54:50.836 --> 02:54:54.038]  Will NATO endlessly escalate as Ukraine starts to lose the war?
[02:54:54.218 --> 02:54:54.478]  Yes.
[02:54:55.318 --> 02:55:06.024]  Yes, they will, because they're so deeply invested in this war now that they will all be driven from office if they cannot come home with some sort of a... Is there some third way...
[02:55:06.824 --> 02:55:12.145]  I guess you were saying months ago to do a deal and let Russia have those main... Here's what should be happening.
[02:55:12.185 --> 02:55:18.967]  There should be back-channel conversations between the United States, Russia, and Ukraine.
[02:55:19.387 --> 02:55:22.488]  And as far as we know, those conversations are not happening.
[02:55:22.708 --> 02:55:27.109]  There should always be those conversations happening to see where they can agree.
[02:55:27.759 --> 02:55:28.899]  But that's what Putin's doing.
[02:55:29.099 --> 02:55:32.020]  He's waiting, calling a police action, letting the West escalate.
[02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:34.981]  Because I saw him put his worst troops in up front.
[02:55:35.441 --> 02:55:43.923]  Analysts I know, including people that were over there, they said he put in the worst troops first, which was kind of almost like what MedMed, when he took over Constantinople, did.
[02:55:44.444 --> 02:55:47.224]  Right now he has his best people there and he has his best generals.
[02:55:47.244 --> 02:55:55.047]  What I'm saying is he did put in his lowest level first to kind of soak up the weapons and track things, and then it looks like he's about to send in the rest of the troops.
[02:55:55.067 --> 02:55:56.047]  This is horrible.
[02:55:56.587 --> 02:55:57.447]  I mean, this is horrible.
[02:55:58.188 --> 02:55:59.148]  What's about to happen?
[02:55:59.168 --> 02:56:00.148]  Well, it's about to get worse.
[02:56:00.188 --> 02:56:03.370]  And what does the President of Poland want in his 90,000 troops there?
[02:56:03.810 --> 02:56:05.290]  He thinks they can win back Crimea.
[02:56:05.491 --> 02:56:06.671]  Win back Crimea?
[02:56:06.711 --> 02:56:11.253]  There isn't a circumstance on the planet in which the Russians would surrender Crimea.
[02:56:13.672 --> 02:56:18.375]  And then we've got Larry Fink, remember there he is with Zelensky, backing the war.
[02:56:18.395 --> 02:56:19.516]  I mean, this is just insane.
[02:56:20.256 --> 02:56:24.819]  Well, Larry Fink is well invested in the military-industrial complex, and they're making it up.
[02:56:24.839 --> 02:56:27.521]  All right, what are you going to cover in two minutes with Owen Schroer?
[02:56:28.041 --> 02:56:29.602]  Infowars.com.org slash showthewarroom.
[02:56:29.622 --> 02:56:30.363]  What are you going to cover, Judge?
[02:56:30.383 --> 02:56:41.390]  I'm going to talk about whatever Owen wants, but I have a feeling it'll be a continuation of this conversation about how morally wrong and bankrupt it is for the American government to be supporting Ukraine.
[02:56:41.410 --> 02:56:41.770]  Judge, ten seconds.
[02:56:41.790 --> 02:56:42.531]  How do they find your show?
[02:56:43.251 --> 02:56:45.933]  JudgingFreedom or JudgeNap.com.
[02:56:45.973 --> 02:56:47.614]  Five days a week, this kind of talk.
[02:56:47.674 --> 02:56:47.834]  Amazing.
[02:56:47.854 --> 02:56:49.275]  I'm not as good as Alex, but I try.
[02:56:49.295 --> 02:56:50.296]  No, you're doing a great job.
[02:56:50.336 --> 02:56:51.177]  Good to have you here.
[02:56:50.996 --> 02:56:52.996]  War room coming up right now with Judge Knapp.
[02:56:52.996 --> 02:57:03.996]  [Music]
[02:57:03.996 --> 02:57:09.996]   They realized that the shots were causing the explosion of chronic disease,
[02:57:09.996 --> 02:57:17.996]   asthma, neuroimmune diseases like psychosis, ADHD, autism, cancer, cancer, cancer, autoimmune diseases.
[02:57:18.604 --> 02:57:21.804]  So they realized in 2011, they caused it all.
[02:57:22.265 --> 02:57:36.731]   So, or in 2009, and when our paper came out, they realized that these were the shots were associated Strongly, very strongly, the chance of them not being associated, it was like being struck by lightning.
[02:57:37.191 --> 02:58:00.895]   One in at least a million in a p-value and so they covered this all up because of course they were liable now because for the 42 million Americans who are asymptomatic carriers of HIV, And SARS-CoV-2 and other XMRVs, other manufactured mouse, monkey and human viruses.
[02:58:01.176 --> 02:58:07.326]  The game was premeditated murder of the 42 million people you're liable for their injury.
[02:58:07.910 --> 02:58:09.451]  Premeditated murder.
[02:58:09.671 --> 02:58:17.296]  If you give somebody who already has an antibody a shot, you will get antibody-dependent enhancement.
[02:58:17.336 --> 02:58:23.060]  Oh, so they were getting rid of the people they'd already poisoned knowing that giving them a second or third or fourth dose would kill them.
[02:58:23.120 --> 02:58:23.300]  Wow.
[02:58:24.420 --> 02:58:25.160]  Correct.
[02:58:25.280 --> 02:58:36.504]  Kill us, cremate us, add a mask, add a mask and isolation, and you'll blame the people for COPD or any of the other co-diseases.
[02:58:36.824 --> 02:58:41.166]  You never inject an HIV-positive person with any vaccine.
[02:58:41.206 --> 02:58:42.686]  We never did.
[02:58:43.267 --> 02:58:44.507]  Never until now.
[02:58:44.787 --> 02:58:50.069]  You do not drive the disease-causing entity through their body.
[02:58:50.769 --> 02:58:55.492]  All over the world, the people that have had the COVID vaccine are testing positive for HIV.
[02:58:55.552 --> 02:58:57.794]  Is that because the spike protein is from HIV?
[02:58:57.814 --> 02:59:02.357]  It has GP120, glycoprotein 120, absolutely.
[02:59:02.717 --> 02:59:07.520]  It also has the monkey, mouse, and manufactured XMRV.
[02:59:07.661 --> 02:59:12.664]  So the spike protein is killing, you know, literally the 12%.
[02:59:13.524 --> 02:59:18.528]  So you're saying it's a binary weapon where they already are preloaded with it and this triggers the next phase?
[02:59:19.568 --> 02:59:20.629]  Correct.
[02:59:22.710 --> 02:59:34.576]  And the more vaccines you got, especially Gardasil, because that has the toxic synthetic lipid nanoparticles similar to the one in the COVID shot.
[02:59:34.656 --> 02:59:42.940]  Prior to the COVID shot, the deadliest vaccine, we saw athletes dropping dead on the field, passing out, falling down, all the things.
[02:59:42.980 --> 02:59:44.541]  Why is it particularly the athletes?
[02:59:46.349 --> 02:59:50.591]  Um, because they operate at oxygen max, um, capacity max.
[02:59:50.631 --> 02:59:54.794]  They're, they're operating at such a high level in their mitochondria.
[02:59:54.854 --> 02:59:59.396]  This is an energy production, oxygen, um, necessary disease.
[02:59:59.936 --> 03:00:01.797]  So they create, that's what they're finding.
[03:00:01.817 --> 03:00:03.158]  They turbocharge the blood clots.
[03:00:04.218 --> 03:00:04.539]  Correct.
[03:00:04.859 --> 03:00:04.999]  Wow.
[03:00:06.625 --> 03:00:08.265]  And ischemia, lack of oxygen.
[03:00:08.886 --> 03:00:26.369]  So constricted blood vessels too, because athletes are running, they're constricted, they're working so that the blood flows and it doesn't flow, which is why your nitric oxide product, that new product, I hope you'll show it, because that's a very important thing to have for acute events.
[03:00:26.530 --> 03:00:33.051]  It dissolves under the tongue, gives you an instant relaxing of your endothelium, your vasculature.
[03:00:33.311 --> 03:00:34.492]  You looked at our Nitric Oxide.
[03:00:34.532 --> 03:00:35.513]  I saw it was the top rated.
[03:00:35.533 --> 03:00:36.374]  They let us private label it.
[03:00:36.394 --> 03:00:37.335]  It's the best seller.
[03:00:37.676 --> 03:00:38.717]  You've looked at our formula.
[03:00:38.757 --> 03:00:39.197]  You like it?
[03:00:39.418 --> 03:00:40.258]  I did and I do.
[03:00:40.559 --> 03:00:40.819]  Yes.
[03:00:41.340 --> 03:00:42.341]  I'm not a scientist like you.
[03:00:42.361 --> 03:00:44.643]  What do these compounds do creating Nitric Oxide?
[03:00:44.663 --> 03:00:45.244]  What does it do?
[03:00:45.704 --> 03:00:47.346]  It relaxes the vasculature.
[03:00:47.626 --> 03:00:50.309]  So the clot will go through and not restrict.
[03:00:50.669 --> 03:00:52.251]  It allows it to relax.
[03:00:52.331 --> 03:00:53.793]  It lowers the blood pressure.
