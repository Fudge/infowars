[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.991]  Listen, I think we gotta get, we gotta get Trump back in office.
[00:00:03.111 --> 00:00:09.916]  I know you got a lot of blackmailed people in your audience that are ready to move on from Trump, but I don't believe there's anybody else.
[00:00:10.137 --> 00:00:13.839]  There's not a live player on the planet that can step in and do what Trump has done.
[00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.021]  He spent $70 billion on lawyers.
[00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:23.770]  No, no, I tend to agree with you.
[00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.975]  After he's been through what he's been through, they're really going after him.
[00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:28.495]  It's real.
[00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:29.456]  They're going after me.
[00:00:29.516 --> 00:00:29.977]  It's real.
[00:00:30.037 --> 00:00:32.500]  I know it's real with him.
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.145]  They are so scared of him right now, we would be stupid to throw the baby out with the bathwater.
[00:00:37.165 --> 00:00:37.946]  I think that's what you're saying.
[00:00:38.827 --> 00:00:47.670]  Trump's not perfect, and by no means is he, but if you look at his picks that he had, you know, personnel picks, people he put in his cabinet with him and stuff like that.
[00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:53.545]  He had to get a coalition government going or the rhinos would have just dropped the ball on him early on.
[00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:56.447]  And people talk about how he didn't get nothing done during his first.
[00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:58.808]  You absolutely don't know how government works.
[00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:06.694]  Unless you have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, control of the White House and the House, you're generally not going to get anything done.
[00:01:06.714 --> 00:01:07.174]  Well, exactly.
[00:01:07.194 --> 00:01:09.336]  And it was good that he never ran for office.
[00:01:10.076 --> 00:01:13.218]  Nobody ever did that and won the presidency other than George Washington.
[00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:15.640]  But then he didn't know what he was doing.
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.181]  He's gotten his education now.
[00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:19.702]  Hey, he's a trial by fire.
[00:01:19.722 --> 00:01:20.663]  Ain't no doubt about that.
[00:01:20.723 --> 00:01:24.405]  But like I said, there's not another live player on the planet that can step in.
[00:01:24.525 --> 00:01:33.772]  And after DeSantis had to walk back his comments the other day on Ukraine, you realize you're, you know, Trump's all alone in a sea of just sea monsters.
[00:01:33.812 --> 00:01:34.632]  Well, that's it.
[00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:38.455]  I mean, I'm not into lesser to evils, but it's like a football game.
[00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:40.156]  Who are you going to put on the field?
[00:01:40.916 --> 00:01:42.277]  People can say, well, he's not perfect.
[00:01:42.618 --> 00:01:44.139]  He dropped the ball here and he did that.
[00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.441]  But he also scored some of the biggest touchdowns and victories we ever had.
[00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:50.602]  And he's gotten rid of Jared Kushner.
[00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:52.643]  I have a good feeling about Trump right now.
[00:01:52.683 --> 00:01:53.903]  I mean, he's under attack.
[00:01:54.264 --> 00:01:54.964]  He's in battle.
[00:01:55.024 --> 00:01:55.904]  That's why I'm supporting him.
[00:01:56.825 --> 00:02:01.126]  If you look at his policy videos, it's enough to have gotten other men killed.
[00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:05.548]  Look, Kennedy talked about a monolithic conspiracy that we're surrounded by.
[00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:06.961]  Later he's gone.
[00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:08.542]  They did the same thing with Nixon.
[00:02:08.782 --> 00:02:11.103]  They shot Reagan.
[00:02:11.443 --> 00:02:20.087]  I just don't see how the guy has been able to walk this fine line of doing what he needs to do, expose the deep state to the American people, and not get shot in the process.
[00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:21.668]  That is powerfully said.
[00:02:21.868 --> 00:02:23.969]  Presidents have been killed for saying far less.
[00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:28.651]  What he is saying is causing irreparable harm to the New World Order.
[00:02:33.368 --> 00:02:38.291]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:40.131]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:59.131]  [Music]
[00:02:59.131 --> 00:03:01.943]   InfoWars Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:03:06.593 --> 00:03:08.053]  It's Tuesday, April 11th, 2023.
[00:03:08.093 --> 00:03:10.314]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:03:10.354 --> 00:03:15.196]  We're going to be live over the next four hours out of the War Room, 3 p.m.
[00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:16.416]  Central with the great Owen Schroeder.
[00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:18.097]  All right.
[00:03:18.137 --> 00:03:19.277]  I like to take action.
[00:03:19.377 --> 00:03:21.238]  I like victory.
[00:03:22.738 --> 00:03:35.582]  So we have the gun shop owner and big gun trainer here in Texas joining us in the third hour, who's just won his second federal court case overturning Biden gun control.
[00:03:37.554 --> 00:03:39.635]  He already overturned Trump's gun control.
[00:03:41.376 --> 00:03:44.157]  Michael Cargill joining us in studio.
[00:03:44.197 --> 00:03:44.837]  Great friend of mine.
[00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:46.097]  What a great patriot.
[00:03:46.237 --> 00:03:46.958]  I love victory.
[00:03:46.978 --> 00:03:48.979]  I love leadership.
[00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:50.519]  He'll be with us to talk about that.
[00:03:51.179 --> 00:04:08.069]   And of course, the big case last Friday with the federal government And Soros putting in these DAs they've been funding that put people in jail for defending themselves and the army sergeant that had a gun pointed at him so he shot the antifa.
[00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:10.871]  Garbage in my view.
[00:04:12.453 --> 00:04:13.374]  Gargill's an expert on that.
[00:04:13.394 --> 00:04:14.374]  He'll be joining us in the third hour.
[00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:18.518]  But I'm gonna open the phones up in the first and the second hour.
[00:04:18.538 --> 00:04:21.241]  And then we have a special guest in the fourth.
[00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:31.095]  I was sitting here looking at all this incredible news just minutes ago before I went live, and I thought, where do I start first?
[00:04:31.135 --> 00:04:32.275]  And I think it's here.
[00:04:35.698 --> 00:04:52.815]   A week ago, or a week and a half ago, Barack Obama, who's really president right now, gave a speech, and it was recorded, and they put a transcript out, and he said, it's Trump's fault China double-crossed the West and that China's taking the planet over.
[00:04:53.275 --> 00:04:54.836]  And that China's about to invade Taiwan.
[00:04:56.738 --> 00:04:57.099]  Remember that?
[00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:58.019]  Covered at the time.
[00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:09.610]  And I have a George Soros clip from 2009 where he's being interviewed by the deputy head of the Davos group, Christina Freeland.
[00:05:11.491 --> 00:05:15.414]  And how China's gonna take over, and we gotta get rid of the dollar, and America's done.
[00:05:16.014 --> 00:05:27.522]  You fast forward 10 years, 11 years, going back about a year ago, and Soros says, Xi Jinping is Hitler, we gotta have war with China, and China's the most evil force on Earth.
[00:05:27.902 --> 00:05:39.310]  So back when George Soros thought he controlled China, and Xi Jinping, China's the best thing since sliced bread, and mother's milk, and blue skies, and a full tank of gas.
[00:05:42.915 --> 00:05:50.596]  But as soon as China doesn't follow his orders, the tyranny he helped set up is the worst thing on earth.
[00:05:53.377 --> 00:05:54.377]  So we've got those clips.
[00:05:54.557 --> 00:05:57.078]  We're going to be getting to those coming up next segment.
[00:05:57.098 --> 00:05:58.238]  Because what does that illustrate?
[00:05:59.998 --> 00:06:01.999]  These globalists are not in control.
[00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:03.879]  They're not all powerful.
[00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.499]  And they're dangerous.
[00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:09.640]  And we don't just need the general public to turn against these people.
[00:06:11.874 --> 00:06:13.495]  We need everybody in the system.
[00:06:13.676 --> 00:06:17.218]  I don't care if you're black, white, gay, straight, old, young, brown.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.841]  I don't care if you're polka-dotted.
[00:06:21.242 --> 00:06:22.463]  These people are crazy!
[00:06:23.744 --> 00:06:26.646]  And they just hit us with a bunch of poison shots regardless of who you are.
[00:06:27.147 --> 00:06:29.128]  How many establishment people died from the shots?
[00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:30.790]  They didn't get a memo not to take it.
[00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:36.634]  We've got to come to our senses and just pump the brakes.
[00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:43.121]  Because the train that is humanity is going off the edge of a cliff right now.
[00:06:44.921 --> 00:06:45.621]  And it's that simple.
[00:06:46.802 --> 00:06:50.323]  So we're gonna hit that first when we come back, and then just all the news.
[00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:52.664]  And it is insane.
[00:06:54.404 --> 00:06:58.865]  But we're gonna hit all of it we can get to here today.
[00:07:00.226 --> 00:07:10.036]   And also, every time I come across one of these clips that I'd forgotten I saw decades ago, and I'm glad Researchers have dug up.
[00:07:10.817 --> 00:07:13.937]  I found the sweetie pie.
[00:07:14.938 --> 00:07:15.878]  He was a sweetie pie.
[00:07:16.778 --> 00:07:18.219]  Ted Gunderson, man, that guy.
[00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:20.939]  I'd hear him say this stuff 25, 30 years ago.
[00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:25.201]  I thought he was nuts, except I kept researching and finding it was true.
[00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:31.842]  A little short clip, resurfaced on Twitter, where he lays out every damn thing that was going to go down.
[00:07:33.143 --> 00:07:34.903]  That was back when the FBI was not pure evil.
[00:07:35.843 --> 00:07:37.104]  We're going to play that as well coming up.
[00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:37.464]  Stay with us.
[00:07:38.697 --> 00:07:40.658]  The globalists want us on our knees.
[00:07:40.698 --> 00:07:43.078]  They're turning off the infrastructure.
[00:07:43.098 --> 00:07:44.379]  They're turning off the power.
[00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:46.059]  They're turning off the electricity.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.720]  They're flooding us with fentanyl.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.780]  They're brainwashing us.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.001]  They're trying to break our will.
[00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:52.402]  But we are aware that they're the enemy.
[00:07:52.982 --> 00:07:55.062]  And so this is going to backfire on them.
[00:07:55.122 --> 00:07:55.923]  I predicted that.
[00:07:56.383 --> 00:07:57.743]  It is backfiring on them.
[00:07:57.943 --> 00:07:58.884]  I bet on humanity.
[00:07:59.884 --> 00:08:02.345]  The viewers and listeners of this broadcast bet on humanity.
[00:08:03.305 --> 00:08:05.026]  And now the globalists are in deep trouble.
[00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:07.394]  So, first big story I want to hit.
[00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:27.884]   About a week and a half ago, we covered at the time, there was a big headline about the current president, Barack Obama, his puppet is Biden, and he was giving a big speech to Democrat donors, and he said, you type the headline in, Obama blames Trump for China's rise.
[00:08:28.765 --> 00:08:33.126]  So the globalists go to China when they didn't have running water or electricity in 98% of the country.
[00:08:33.767 --> 00:08:36.428]  They build it up the 70s right through the 2000s.
[00:08:36.888 --> 00:08:38.429]  They do one-sided trade deals.
[00:08:38.449 --> 00:08:39.989]  They give them all our weapons technology.
[00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:41.630]  They let them buy up Hollywood.
[00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.951]  They let them buy up our infrastructure.
[00:08:42.971 --> 00:08:44.171]  They let them buy up our farmland.
[00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:45.912]  They let them buy up the computer companies.
[00:08:49.751 --> 00:09:08.767]  And then they turn around when Trump sees it's happening, gets into office, stands up to them, flips the trade deficit on its head, makes us number one energy exporter in the world in just a few years, and Obama, we just put the headline on screen, Obama then blames Trump.
[00:09:11.349 --> 00:09:22.597]   Well, I've got a clip from 2009 with Christina Freeland, the Ukrainian vice leader under Trudeau,
[00:09:22.597 --> 00:09:32.399]   Christina Freeland, interviewing George Soros about the USA, China, and the New World Order.
[00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:39.848]   A decline in the value of the dollar is necessary. China will be the engine driving forward a managed decline of the
[00:09:39.848 --> 00:09:40.358]  dollar.
[00:09:40.358 --> 00:09:46.998]   Now we're watching a managed decline of the dollar with the BRICS and all the policies designed to kill the dollar,
[00:09:49.478 --> 00:09:54.198]  but notice what's happened to George Soros since 2009.
[00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:59.052]  By about 2000, he's critical of Xi Jinping.
[00:09:59.072 --> 00:10:01.154]  By 2001, he says Xi Jinping is a bad person.
[00:10:01.894 --> 00:10:05.757]  By 2002, he says Xi Jinping is Hitler and we're at war with him.
[00:10:06.237 --> 00:10:09.460]  And now, by 2023, he's calling for war.
[00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:12.281]  I agree China's out of control.
[00:10:12.642 --> 00:10:13.762]  I agree Xi Jinping's bad.
[00:10:15.564 --> 00:10:32.948]   But Western elites use China to give them market dominance, not just over communist Chinese crap and things that break by the time you get them out of the box from Walmart or Target, but the superconducting systems, the microchips, the weapon systems, the drugs.
[00:10:33.148 --> 00:10:34.329]  Most our drugs are made there.
[00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.472]  And so now China has double-crossed the globalists.
[00:10:39.512 --> 00:10:40.792]  I mean, who couldn't see that coming?
[00:10:40.832 --> 00:10:41.913]  I predicted it for decades.
[00:10:44.841 --> 00:10:49.625]  And George Soros says that Xi Jinping is the new Hitler.
[00:10:50.386 --> 00:10:50.847]  Type it in.
[00:10:51.007 --> 00:10:53.389]  George Soros says Xi Jinping is the new Hitler.
[00:10:53.809 --> 00:10:55.110]  You'll get the Times of London.
[00:10:55.731 --> 00:10:57.993]  You'll get the Economist put out by the Rothschilds.
[00:10:58.333 --> 00:10:59.895]  You'll get the Financial Times of London.
[00:11:00.155 --> 00:11:01.256]  You'll get the New York Times.
[00:11:01.496 --> 00:11:02.597]  You'll get the Washington Post.
[00:11:04.028 --> 00:11:13.772]  This is Frankenstein's monster that George Soros and the Globalists with their policies helped create, and everybody knows what Frankenstein, the monster, does.
[00:11:14.693 --> 00:11:16.553]  He always goes after his creator.
[00:11:18.954 --> 00:11:28.479]  Now, the Globalists literally thought they could control a totalitarian, anti-human dictatorship that sells political dissidence organs and has tens of millions in slave camps.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:50.443]   They really think You can set up a tyranny that has massive power and that it's going to continue to follow orders from Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Tim Cook and George Soros.
[00:11:51.083 --> 00:11:54.105]  That shows you the mental illness of these people.
[00:11:54.805 --> 00:12:04.026]   Anybody that read a history book, no matter where you were, In Asia, or Africa, or ancient Europe, or Mesoamerica.
[00:12:05.307 --> 00:12:10.432]  Every time this happens, these alliances of tyrants, and then they turn on each other.
[00:12:11.493 --> 00:12:12.774]  And what happens in the process?
[00:12:12.894 --> 00:12:14.936]  Major war, collapse, destruction.
[00:12:14.996 --> 00:12:19.500]  So, the car market started plunging six months ago.
[00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:25.720]   Then three months ago, the real estate market for private home ownership plunged.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.838]  Now the commercial real estate's plunging.
[00:12:27.838 --> 00:12:28.759]  The numbers are in.
[00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:33.720]   I was on with Steve Bannon today, and before I went on, former top Trump advisor,
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.279]  Steve Cortez was on with him.
[00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:37.600]  It was a 10-minute segment.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.080]  It was powerful.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.039]  And I got the crew downloading that second hour of Bannon.
[00:12:43.911 --> 00:12:47.236]  We're going to play that 10-minute clip as soon as the crew tells me we get it.
[00:12:47.937 --> 00:12:54.546]  Because he knocked it out of the park, how they, by design, imploded the economy, and why we're going into this depression.
[00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:12.054]  If they keep posing as the saviors and aren't identified, they're going to sell us on the central bank digital currency, they're going to sell us on the social credit score, and the vaccine passport, and the universal basic income because we're so poor after the collapse.
[00:13:12.554 --> 00:13:19.176]  We have to point out that that's just a process to get us deeper in chains, more under their control.
[00:13:22.797 --> 00:13:25.778]  So if you think things are bad now, they plan to make them far worse.
[00:13:27.554 --> 00:13:29.577]  So they still want the Chinese Communist model.
[00:13:29.617 --> 00:13:30.238]  That's their model.
[00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:32.161]  China's just bucking them.
[00:13:34.065 --> 00:13:34.946]  On who runs the world.
[00:13:35.766 --> 00:13:42.731]  But they're all still going towards total AI, censorship, surveillance, control, slavery.
[00:13:43.291 --> 00:13:47.994]  So the chains are going on right now, and we have to wake up to this and say no, and we are.
[00:13:48.014 --> 00:13:58.601]  And the good news is, we have a fighting chance because of you, the viewers and listeners, that have cared over the years, and done your own research, and know we were telling the truth, and have promoted this broadcast and others.
[00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:02.303]  But now is the real critical juncture in the fight.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:16.508]  So let's go ahead and play this clip of Christina Freeland, the Deputy Prime Minister up in Canada, interviewing George Soros back when China, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, China's going to run things.
[00:14:16.929 --> 00:14:17.729]  China's the boss.
[00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:18.610]  China's God.
[00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:19.991]  China's the master.
[00:14:20.211 --> 00:14:21.211]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:14:21.252 --> 00:14:22.072]  They're going to run everything.
[00:14:22.092 --> 00:14:22.793]  Just bend over.
[00:14:22.853 --> 00:14:23.633]  Let them spy on us.
[00:14:23.893 --> 00:14:25.094]  Let them buy out the infrastructure.
[00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:26.275]  Let them have spies everywhere.
[00:14:26.535 --> 00:14:27.075]  Just do it.
[00:14:27.135 --> 00:14:27.956]  It's the way it is.
[00:14:28.016 --> 00:14:28.756]  It's all over.
[00:14:29.017 --> 00:14:31.038]  Just lay down and die.
[00:14:31.298 --> 00:14:32.299]  Resistance is futile.
[00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:42.033]  And 10 years later, 11 years later, Xi Jinping is Hitler and an authoritarian and is Orwellian and, oh my god, we better do something, he's so horrible.
[00:14:42.953 --> 00:14:43.994]  They're not all powerful.
[00:14:44.254 --> 00:14:49.396]  Their only power is getting us to be convinced that they are powerful and ceding our power to them.
[00:14:49.636 --> 00:14:50.576]  Here's the clip, we'll go to break.
[00:14:53.978 --> 00:15:09.204]  No, I think this would be the time because you really need to bring China into the creation of a new world order, financial world order.
[00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:14.987]  They are kind of reluctant members of the IMF.
[00:15:15.067 --> 00:15:24.893]   They play along, but they don't make much of a contribution because it's not their Not their institution.
[00:15:25.514 --> 00:15:29.879]  Their share is not commensurate.
[00:15:29.899 --> 00:15:33.743]  Their voting rights are not commensurate to their weight.
[00:15:34.364 --> 00:15:44.855]   So I think you need a new world order that China has to be part of the process of creating it.
[00:15:45.295 --> 00:15:46.416]  And they have to buy in.
[00:15:46.756 --> 00:15:47.757]  They have to own it.
[00:15:48.217 --> 00:15:55.982]  The same way as, let's say, the United States owns the Washington Consensus, the current order.
[00:15:56.603 --> 00:16:06.670]  And I think this would be a more stable one, where you would have a coordinated policies.
[00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:14.430]   I think the makings of it are already there because the G20 in agreeing to peer
[00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.930]  reviews effectively is moving in that direction.
[00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:24.930]   Given this continued weakness in the US economy, are people right to start to be concerned about the dollar?
[00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:32.930]   Well, they are of course, and the dollar is a very weak currency except for all the others.
[00:16:33.319 --> 00:16:43.226]  So there is a general sort of lack of confidence in currencies and a move away from currencies into real assets.
[00:16:43.807 --> 00:16:52.574]  The Chinese are continuing to run a big trade surplus.
[00:16:53.394 --> 00:16:55.256]  And they're still accumulating assets.
[00:16:55.797 --> 00:17:04.025]  And basically, the renminbi is permanently undervalued because it's tied to the dollar.
[00:17:05.746 --> 00:17:10.746]  and there's a diversification.
[00:17:10.746 --> 00:17:16.185]   All right, if you just joined us, I played an extremely powerful clip
[00:17:16.185 --> 00:17:19.585]   of George Soros talking to, he's been at one point the deputy head
[00:17:19.585 --> 00:17:23.646]   of the World Economic Forum, the vice prime minister of Canada
[00:17:23.646 --> 00:17:26.945]   currently under the dictator, 'cause he stole the election,
[00:17:26.945 --> 00:17:30.265]   only had 30% of the vote on record, but he's parliamentary manipulation,
[00:17:30.265 --> 00:17:34.425]   state of power, Justin Trudeau, interviewing him about, well, the dollar's weak,
[00:17:34.425 --> 00:17:35.666]  we gotta get rid of the dollar.
[00:17:35.666 --> 00:17:37.506]  new rule orders here, China will be in charge.
[00:17:38.212 --> 00:17:41.194]  That's the summation of the two-minute, 19-second clip we just played.
[00:17:43.516 --> 00:17:44.957]  If you're a new viewer, just tune in right now.
[00:17:44.977 --> 00:17:47.518]  Go to the archive this afternoon, the full show will be posted.
[00:17:47.538 --> 00:17:49.979]  15-20 minutes of the show, we play the clip.
[00:17:50.739 --> 00:17:50.999]  Okay?
[00:17:51.059 --> 00:17:55.561]  So, that's what's so frustrating, is these people sit here salivating about the end of America.
[00:17:55.881 --> 00:17:57.062]  I'm warning you it's coming.
[00:17:57.362 --> 00:17:59.122]  I'm warning you they're cutting off our resources.
[00:17:59.142 --> 00:18:01.864]  They're saying they're doing it, and then I'm the conspiracy theorist.
[00:18:03.244 --> 00:18:08.886]  But now you notice, China double-crossed them, starting in about 2011-12.
[00:18:13.396 --> 00:18:21.701]  And it took the neocons of the deep state a few years to figure out they were being bitch slapped around by a real dictator who doesn't respect them, who doesn't care about them.
[00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:26.684]  So it's two different evil forces fighting with each other.
[00:18:28.365 --> 00:18:32.068]  And I want to tie that in to now what's currently happening with the global economy.
[00:18:32.947 --> 00:18:37.450]  But the only reason they haven't already totally tanked the dollar is China isn't going along with them.
[00:18:37.791 --> 00:18:48.439]  So now they've been trying to prop it up, but it's too late because they have the schizophrenic policy of attacking Russia, which drives India, Russia and China and Brazil into the bricks.
[00:18:49.339 --> 00:18:52.462]  So their old policy still baked in.
[00:18:53.533 --> 00:18:54.293]  To end America.
[00:18:54.934 --> 00:18:56.714]  But now they're trying to stop the brakes.
[00:18:57.034 --> 00:19:03.597]  They still want to burn cities down and take our guns and ship fentanyl in and get rid of the borders and demoralize us and castrate our children.
[00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:07.818]  They just can't help themselves all of that, but they're weakening the host.
[00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:18.762]  When they were supposed to merge us with China, they'd be in control of China, and then they would have the managed decline of the dollar, which translates into what?
[00:19:19.878 --> 00:19:23.600]  What does the managed decline of the dollar translate into for a three-year-old?
[00:19:25.441 --> 00:19:28.983]  Your currency, especially when you don't produce a lot because you've been shut down by design.
[00:19:29.323 --> 00:19:30.384]  They even shut our energy off.
[00:19:30.804 --> 00:19:34.726]  If all you got's a currency, what's the managed decline of the currency?
[00:19:34.786 --> 00:19:38.148]  The managed decline of the country.
[00:19:39.289 --> 00:19:41.590]  And what's the managed decline of the country?
[00:19:43.311 --> 00:19:47.794]  The managed decline of the economy.
[00:19:48.826 --> 00:20:03.653]  The managed decline of the people, the managed decline of the individual, the managed decline of you and I. Get a brownie point from the English teacher.
[00:20:03.673 --> 00:20:05.494]  Instead of saying me.
[00:20:06.815 --> 00:20:07.475]  There we are.
[00:20:09.196 --> 00:20:14.278]  And it's in your face, the great reset to build on your ashes to build back better.
[00:20:14.918 --> 00:20:17.800]  What lunatic would go along with this?
[00:20:19.082 --> 00:20:22.423]  Even George Soros is pulled back from China and they're trying to scramble.
[00:20:22.803 --> 00:20:30.945]  But still their minions, trained to hate America, trained to worship Xi Jinping, trained to worship the globalists, just can't help it because they're still following the old script.
[00:20:31.325 --> 00:20:35.627]  Even though your masters have tried to pull out of the old script, you can't help it.
[00:20:37.227 --> 00:20:40.968]  So yeah, I spend an inordinate amount of time talking to the black sheep.
[00:20:41.268 --> 00:20:42.288]  And I don't mean black people.
[00:20:42.368 --> 00:20:48.190]  I mean, they see me as a black sheep because I'm an anti-establishment, but I really see those of you that serve evil.
[00:20:48.934 --> 00:20:51.475]  And are going against common sense as crazy sheep.
[00:20:52.315 --> 00:20:53.115]  I mean, you're nuts.
[00:20:54.155 --> 00:20:56.075]  There's no reason to go along with this.
[00:20:56.236 --> 00:20:57.076]  Not one.
[00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:58.576]  Even if you're George Soros.
[00:21:00.016 --> 00:21:01.277]  They were in love with China.
[00:21:01.577 --> 00:21:02.497]  They were the answer.
[00:21:02.557 --> 00:21:03.777]  They were the holy grail of tyranny.
[00:21:04.017 --> 00:21:05.417]  They had a billion and a half slaves.
[00:21:05.717 --> 00:21:06.478]  They were the model.
[00:21:06.518 --> 00:21:07.158]  They were everything.
[00:21:07.178 --> 00:21:15.800]  And of course, just like Stalin and Hitler in the middle of World War II were in an arms deal and in a treaty together and were allies, they turned against each other.
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.820]  Gee, who could have seen that coming?
[00:21:19.341 --> 00:21:19.661]  I did.
[00:21:21.982 --> 00:21:24.023]  And that's the delusional nature of the globalist.
[00:21:24.704 --> 00:21:25.964]  And I'll tell you what else I can see.
[00:21:26.745 --> 00:21:28.286]  Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
[00:21:28.326 --> 00:21:29.766]  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
[00:21:29.826 --> 00:21:34.009]  All the King's horses, all the New World Order's men couldn't put their world government back together again.
[00:21:35.569 --> 00:21:36.350]  Any moron!
[00:21:37.503 --> 00:21:38.224]  Who knows history?
[00:21:38.884 --> 00:21:50.172]  We'll know that once an elite and a corrupt system is exposed, it cannot do anything to put it back together again, except make the collapse worse for themselves, everybody else.
[00:21:51.473 --> 00:21:55.917]  So I'm kind of like the cops, when they got a guy holding people hostage in a bank.
[00:21:57.238 --> 00:21:59.239]  No pun intended to what this tragedy yesterday.
[00:21:59.619 --> 00:22:00.980]  He didn't hold the hostages, he shot people.
[00:22:03.142 --> 00:22:05.564]  Or a guy holding people hostage, say, at a house.
[00:22:06.656 --> 00:22:13.200]  And the police get on their loudspeakers and they say, those women and children haven't done anything to you.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.663]  Look, you'll probably only spend 10 years in jail right now if you turn them loose.
[00:22:19.364 --> 00:22:22.165]  But you know there's a God in heaven and you kill those women and children.
[00:22:23.406 --> 00:22:24.146]  You don't want to do that.
[00:22:24.226 --> 00:22:25.527]  You don't want to be a bad person.
[00:22:26.228 --> 00:22:27.909]  Why don't you just come out with your hands up?
[00:22:29.009 --> 00:22:30.070]  And we'll go easy on you.
[00:22:31.991 --> 00:22:35.173]  You're not going to make it out of this alive today if you hurt those people.
[00:22:35.713 --> 00:22:36.414]  Stop now.
[00:22:36.494 --> 00:22:37.455]  You've already lost.
[00:22:40.216 --> 00:22:41.957]  And I'm literally sitting here with an order.
[00:22:43.358 --> 00:22:45.580]  Look, you probably don't even know.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.001]  You probably didn't study who you work for.
[00:22:48.021 --> 00:22:48.702]  I have.
[00:22:49.793 --> 00:22:55.136]  The British Crown commissioned all sorts of scientific experiments in the last 300 years.
[00:22:55.916 --> 00:23:02.739]  And 180 years ago they began funding eugenics and a plan for global government and a way to alter society for total control.
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.821]  We're now 180 years into that plan and it's a horrible plan.
[00:23:07.161 --> 00:23:08.742]  You don't have to be part of that plan!
[00:23:08.802 --> 00:23:09.242]  Listen!
[00:23:10.323 --> 00:23:11.584]  You won't even go to prison!
[00:23:12.684 --> 00:23:14.425]  Just put down the poison syringe!
[00:23:14.705 --> 00:23:15.806]  Put down the GMO!
[00:23:16.066 --> 00:23:17.206]  Put down the 5G!
[00:23:17.767 --> 00:23:18.247]  Come out!
[00:23:20.376 --> 00:23:21.976]  And we'll let you go into abstention.
[00:23:23.437 --> 00:23:24.577]  You can just walk away.
[00:23:26.598 --> 00:23:29.558]  Just give us a gas, and we'll let you walk away.
[00:23:30.519 --> 00:23:31.859]  There's been too much pain.
[00:23:31.879 --> 00:23:40.941]  Of course, I'm quoting Humongous from Road Warrior.
[00:23:41.041 --> 00:23:46.663]  I'm not saying that's where we're at, but your minions are like Humongous.
[00:23:50.618 --> 00:23:56.181]  And if anybody, for folks who don't know Humongous, says, will you guys find Humongous speech?
[00:23:57.602 --> 00:24:02.164]  Road Warrior, let's come in next segment with the Humongous speech.
[00:24:02.805 --> 00:24:04.105]  And then I'll get to Ted Gunnarson.
[00:24:05.326 --> 00:24:07.747]  And then I'll get to all the rest of it, and then we'll also take your calls.
[00:24:08.628 --> 00:24:10.489]  But, I mean, look, I've looked at every angle.
[00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:11.469]  I'm obsessed with history.
[00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:15.852]  I'm not one of these fakes that acts like they know stuff and then just has a few talking points.
[00:24:16.252 --> 00:24:17.313]  I live this.
[00:24:17.493 --> 00:24:18.173]  I drink this.
[00:24:18.333 --> 00:24:18.953]  I sleep this.
[00:24:20.532 --> 00:24:29.260]  Everythingness, not to say a cuss word, but I-S-H-T-ness, I-F-U-S-K-ness, this is what I do.
[00:24:30.319 --> 00:24:39.806]  And you don't need to be smart or even informed to know that totalitarianism always gets out of hand and is always bad for everybody, including the establishment.
[00:24:40.166 --> 00:24:40.847]  So stop.
[00:24:41.607 --> 00:24:43.369]  My message to the globalists is stop.
[00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:44.990]  Stop war with Russia.
[00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:46.471]  Do a deal.
[00:24:47.151 --> 00:24:48.232]  Stop war with China.
[00:24:48.812 --> 00:24:49.673]  Stop war with us.
[00:24:50.494 --> 00:24:54.356]  Let's just back off this globalist plan and let's not do it.
[00:24:54.417 --> 00:24:54.817]  But listen.
[00:24:56.388 --> 00:24:57.848]  I know most of you can't help it.
[00:24:57.908 --> 00:25:00.689]  You love the power and the idea of the authority you've got.
[00:25:01.749 --> 00:25:04.250]  And you've been trained to hate America and hate God.
[00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:09.791]  And because you have an anti-Christ spirit, you're not going to be able to stop yourselves.
[00:25:09.871 --> 00:25:15.733]  My message is not to those of you that have committed the ultimate sin and refused the Holy Spirit and gone past the point of return.
[00:25:16.093 --> 00:25:21.893]   My message is to those that are standing on a knife's edge, on a razor's edge, I can go either way.
[00:25:22.133 --> 00:25:27.297]  And I'm saying, if you hear me and you feel touched, that means you still have God in you.
[00:25:28.418 --> 00:25:29.439]  And be like Darth Vader.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.901]  Throw Emperor Palpatine down the reactor shaft.
[00:25:33.242 --> 00:25:34.343]  Don't literally hurt somebody.
[00:25:34.383 --> 00:25:37.986]  I'm saying, take the evil in your life, take your commitment to Satan, and say, you know what?
[00:25:38.146 --> 00:25:38.926]  This is not good.
[00:25:39.227 --> 00:25:40.407]  It's destroying me and my future.
[00:25:40.488 --> 00:25:43.790]  I'm gonna throw you this idea down the shaft.
[00:25:44.351 --> 00:25:45.091]  I'm gonna get rid of it.
[00:25:46.032 --> 00:25:46.753]  And that's all I gotta do.
[00:25:46.873 --> 00:25:47.693]  It's a decision.
[00:25:47.773 --> 00:25:48.434]  It's a commitment.
[00:25:48.594 --> 00:25:49.135]  We'll be right back.
[00:25:49.155 --> 00:25:49.475]  Stay with us.
[00:25:50.558 --> 00:25:59.627]  We're entering an age of the road war, of designed barbarism to collapse civilization and bring in a scientific total tyranny on its ashes.
[00:25:59.967 --> 00:26:05.327]   We must save civilization and build a better future, or enter a new dark age of tyranny,
[00:26:05.327 --> 00:26:08.207]  the likes of which the mind has not imagined.
[00:26:08.207 --> 00:26:21.727]  Greetings from the humongous!
[00:26:21.821 --> 00:26:23.022]  The Lord Humongous!
[00:26:24.162 --> 00:26:26.543]  The Warrior of the Wasteland!
[00:26:28.984 --> 00:26:32.626]  The Ayatollah of Rock and Roller!
[00:26:35.227 --> 00:26:37.388]  I am gravely disappointed.
[00:26:38.328 --> 00:26:40.990]  Again you have made me unleash my jokes of war.
[00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.792]  Look at what remains of the Gallant Scouts.
[00:26:45.932 --> 00:26:46.152]  Why?
[00:26:47.711 --> 00:26:49.972]  Because you're selfish.
[00:26:50.032 --> 00:26:51.553]  You hold your gasoline.
[00:26:52.053 --> 00:26:53.694]  You will not listen to reason.
[00:26:55.014 --> 00:27:00.177]  Now, my prisoners say, you plan to take your gasoline out of the wasteland.
[00:27:01.197 --> 00:27:04.219]  You send them out this morning to find a vehicle.
[00:27:05.119 --> 00:27:09.181]  A rig big enough to hold that fat tank of gas.
[00:27:10.101 --> 00:27:11.442]  What a puny plan.
[00:27:12.342 --> 00:27:13.203]  Look around you.
[00:27:17.426 --> 00:27:17.686]  See?
[00:27:18.026 --> 00:27:21.529]  Nothing can escape!
[00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:24.651]  The Humongous rules the Wasteland!
[00:27:24.671 --> 00:27:25.772]  Give them nothing!
[00:27:26.572 --> 00:27:28.994]  Blow it up!
[00:27:30.355 --> 00:27:33.355]  Her mongers will not be defiled.
[00:27:33.355 --> 00:27:50.355]  Oh, killed a boyfriend.
[00:27:50.908 --> 00:27:52.069]  Roll over now.
[00:27:52.169 --> 00:27:52.769]  I got it!
[00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.609]  (screaming)
[00:27:57.609 --> 00:28:07.850]  I got it! I got it!
[00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.191]  (screaming)
[00:28:10.191 --> 00:28:12.431]  (laughing)
[00:28:12.431 --> 00:28:22.169]  Enough of this.
[00:28:22.169 --> 00:28:22.990]  (laughing)
[00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.829]  Quiet!
[00:28:24.288 --> 00:28:24.848]  Quiet!
[00:28:26.529 --> 00:28:29.932]  No more games.
[00:28:30.192 --> 00:28:31.793]  No more games!
[00:28:31.913 --> 00:28:35.917]  We are here for a purpose.
[00:28:35.957 --> 00:28:37.558]  The perfect allegory of the left.
[00:28:37.598 --> 00:28:39.199]  They want war and to burn everything down now.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.920]  We go in.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.222]  But their masters are promising later, later.
[00:28:45.444 --> 00:28:47.645]  China has already turned against them.
[00:28:47.546 --> 00:28:49.546]  And now their forces are divided.
[00:28:49.546 --> 00:29:04.546]  I still might have a war.
[00:29:05.049 --> 00:29:07.091]  I understand you, Kaelin.
[00:29:07.151 --> 00:29:09.752]  We all lost someone we love.
[00:29:09.812 --> 00:29:11.073]  But we do it my way.
[00:29:11.213 --> 00:29:11.573]  Loses.
[00:29:12.094 --> 00:29:12.994]  Loses way.
[00:29:13.434 --> 00:29:14.755]  We do it my way.
[00:29:15.756 --> 00:29:17.377]  Fear is our ally.
[00:29:17.417 --> 00:29:20.058]  The gasoline will be ours.
[00:29:20.939 --> 00:29:27.443]  Then, you shall have your revenge.
[00:29:28.884 --> 00:29:29.604]  Take him away.
[00:29:31.448 --> 00:29:38.673]  Anybody serving the New World Order might as well be in that fictitious pack of criminals in the Road Warrior.
[00:29:39.493 --> 00:29:41.294]  That's why we're Mad Max TV dot world.
[00:29:42.055 --> 00:29:42.835]  Mad Max TV.
[00:29:44.116 --> 00:29:45.116]  Mad Max world dot TV.
[00:29:46.537 --> 00:29:48.218]  That's where we are in this Mad Max world.
[00:29:48.238 --> 00:29:53.261]  So you can pretend like you're on the winning team, but the globalists don't care about you.
[00:29:54.102 --> 00:29:56.403]  I know our regular audience understands that and knows that.
[00:29:56.423 --> 00:30:00.046]  Just give us the gas, we spare your lives.
[00:30:01.118 --> 00:30:16.070]  So, former FBI agent, head of the Los Angeles sector, Ted Gunterson, says the Bilderberg was in 1993, excuse me, 1996, and New World Order Illuminati is behind all of the heinous crimes against humanity.
[00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:16.551]  Here's the clip.
[00:30:17.752 --> 00:30:20.334]  I personally investigated the Oklahoma City bombing case.
[00:30:22.096 --> 00:30:22.916]  Huge cover-up.
[00:30:22.996 --> 00:30:24.537]  Jack Kennedy's assassination?
[00:30:24.577 --> 00:30:25.197]  Huge cover-up.
[00:30:25.257 --> 00:30:26.637]  Bobby Kennedy's assassination?
[00:30:26.677 --> 00:30:27.377]  Huge cover-up.
[00:30:28.037 --> 00:30:29.118]  World Trade Center?
[00:30:29.998 --> 00:30:30.998]  Huge cover-up.
[00:30:32.719 --> 00:30:33.079]  Okay.
[00:30:33.419 --> 00:30:34.059]  Terrorism.
[00:30:35.619 --> 00:30:39.820]  They're using it as an excuse to take away our constitutional rights and our civil liberties.
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.021]  Cosmic Flame.
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:56.060]   The Bilderbergs, the Illuminati, Bilderberg, New World Order, globalists are the element
[00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:09.740]  It dovetails into the satanic movement, and this movement has infiltrated into our intelligence community, the once great FBI and the CIA.
[00:31:11.581 --> 00:31:19.704]   You know, I'd hear him say that 25 years ago, he'd come in town, I'd come on my radio show, we'd go out to dinner, And I'll go research what he was saying, and it was all true.
[00:31:20.245 --> 00:31:27.728]  And then what, three years ago they released the Finder's Case emails, the FBI released thousands of pages, and everything he told me about that was true.
[00:31:28.368 --> 00:31:36.092]  A CIA command base with kids being kidnapped and raped on video, and the CIA compromising politicians with it.
[00:31:36.512 --> 00:31:38.033]  Ted Gunderson exposed that.
[00:31:39.453 --> 00:31:40.974]  They wanted him to be the FBI director.
[00:31:43.135 --> 00:31:44.736]  And he got out because he wouldn't be part of it.
[00:31:45.649 --> 00:31:48.311]  So yeah, we used to have good folks, high level in the FBI.
[00:31:48.351 --> 00:31:48.871]  He was high level.
[00:31:49.151 --> 00:31:50.712]  You know, he ran the COINTELPRO program.
[00:31:50.992 --> 00:31:52.073]  He thought he was fighting communists.
[00:31:52.093 --> 00:31:52.813]  He apologized.
[00:31:53.194 --> 00:31:57.636]  He was dying of cancer on my show from his hospital bed, that he ran the operations against Martin Luther King.
[00:31:59.337 --> 00:32:00.878]  He said on air, most of it was made up.
[00:32:01.059 --> 00:32:03.060]  King was cheating on his wife, but not as much as they said.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:11.825]  But he still felt bad sending letters to King's wife and harassing him and having women call up King's wife and say, oh, I'm pregnant for Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:32:12.185 --> 00:32:12.946]  And none of that was true.
[00:32:13.996 --> 00:32:20.681]  Even when King stopped cheating on his wife, still Gunnarsson hammered him and hammered him, and he put the Black Panthers in jail, he did it all.
[00:32:21.281 --> 00:32:23.923]  But, before he died, he apologized for it.
[00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:25.704]  But he believed he was doing a good job.
[00:32:26.365 --> 00:32:29.927]  The difference is he didn't blow up federal buildings full of kids and blame it on the American people.
[00:32:30.868 --> 00:32:33.209]  He exposed Oklahoma City, along with General Parton.
[00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:34.710]  So that's very important.
[00:32:35.851 --> 00:32:41.515]  So, very, very powerful information, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:43.607 --> 00:32:49.033]  I'm glad to be able to say on my deathbed, and I'm not judging Gunnarsson, that I won't have to apologize for stuff like that.
[00:32:49.073 --> 00:32:50.995]  But it makes me respect him.
[00:32:51.176 --> 00:32:52.537]  By the way, I've been wanting to get his son on.
[00:32:52.878 --> 00:32:53.619]  Let's get his son on.
[00:32:53.999 --> 00:32:55.140]  He said he'd come on like a year ago.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:55.741]  We never got him on.
[00:32:56.021 --> 00:32:57.023]  I want Gunnarsson's son on.
[00:32:57.643 --> 00:32:58.585]  Gunnarsson was an incredible guy.
[00:33:00.342 --> 00:33:04.484]  But it makes me admire Gunnarsson even more, that when the rubber met the road, he admitted things he did was wrong.
[00:33:05.144 --> 00:33:12.227]  The point is, he was an insider, and he exposed the satanic nature of it, and so much of our success today against their operations is because of him.
[00:33:13.047 --> 00:33:14.308]  So, hats off to Ted Gunnarsson.
[00:33:14.828 --> 00:33:15.849]  All right, some good news.
[00:33:16.029 --> 00:33:17.309]  We need to fund our operation.
[00:33:17.689 --> 00:33:19.690]  We haven't had our best-selling products in for a while.
[00:33:20.111 --> 00:33:20.891]  The cavalry's here.
[00:33:22.233 --> 00:33:25.775]  This is the strongest 10-hour clean energy you're gonna find.

[00:33:29.417 --> 00:33:30.137]  You gotta be careful.
[00:33:30.177 --> 00:33:31.998]  I wouldn't take the full dose the first time you take it.
[00:33:33.686 --> 00:33:35.626]  Memory, focus, strength, stamina.

[00:34:45.967 --> 00:34:46.806]  Retired dentist.
[00:34:46.806 --> 00:34:47.846]  I asked him to order more a month ago.
[00:34:47.846 --> 00:34:48.887]  He didn't do it.
[00:34:48.887 --> 00:34:51.447]  It'll be sold out for months, maybe forever.
[00:34:51.447 --> 00:34:54.086]  Concentrated essential oils with turmeric toothpaste.

[00:35:17.326 --> 00:35:18.406]  It's over the top.
[00:35:18.406 --> 00:35:19.366]  And then there's two different nootropics.

[00:35:23.646 --> 00:35:25.846]  They're excellent, but they operate different ways.

[00:35:41.093 --> 00:35:42.434]  This guy's definitely got the touch.
[00:35:43.134 --> 00:35:44.835]  Joining us in the third hour.
[00:35:45.855 --> 00:35:52.598]  Before I get to all of that, I want to give the number out and talk about the state of the world.
[00:35:53.607 --> 00:36:01.353]  And talk about Russia, talk about China encircling Taiwan the last five days doing attack drills, putting nuclear attack drills on the country.
[00:36:02.014 --> 00:36:07.999]  Biden, again, just like last year, got lost with the Easter Bunny, and like it's a ritual, didn't know who he was.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.680]  We'll talk about that.
[00:36:10.141 --> 00:36:18.508]  I've got a bunch of shooting videos from different blue states and blue cities we're going to get to, and their big push to ban semi-autos.
[00:36:19.588 --> 00:36:22.270]  We've got commercial real estate collapse accelerating.
[00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:28.693]  We've got the Federal Reserve rolling out a central bank digital currency in USA today saying that's not the case.
[00:36:29.734 --> 00:36:34.156]  We've got the drag queen pedo times in overdrive.
[00:36:34.897 --> 00:36:38.158]  We've got more on the Trump indictments.
[00:36:39.399 --> 00:36:40.880]  All of this and more today.
[00:36:42.261 --> 00:36:42.421]  So.
[00:36:43.629 --> 00:36:49.930]  First-time callers, that means if you ever got left on hold at the end, trying to get to all the calls, you're a first-time caller, even if you never got on air.
[00:36:51.391 --> 00:36:54.871]  First-time callers, or I'll say this, here's a new thing.
[00:36:55.692 --> 00:36:59.592]  Not first-time callers, if you haven't gotten on the show in a year.
[00:37:01.593 --> 00:37:03.953]  First-time callers are people that haven't gotten on the show in a year.
[00:37:05.174 --> 00:37:06.474]  I want to give new people a chance.
[00:37:07.282 --> 00:37:15.288]  I love the regular callers, but I want to give that giant audience, that ocean of amazing minds and souls a chance to talk on air, and I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:37:15.828 --> 00:37:17.350]  So the toll-free number is 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, or 877-789-Alex.
[00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:20.112]  And we will take your calls here today on the State of the World.
[00:37:19.952 --> 00:37:24.992]   seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine two
[00:37:24.992 --> 00:37:29.952]   five three nine or eight seven seven seven eight nine Alex and we will take
[00:37:29.952 --> 00:37:35.631]   your calls here today on the state of the world and we put the live show feed
[00:37:35.631 --> 00:37:39.352]   on screen I wrote this headline this morning because I didn't know what else
[00:37:39.352 --> 00:37:43.674]   to say I mean The globalists have triggered the Great Reset.
[00:37:44.514 --> 00:37:50.177]  The world is descending into war and total collapse, while the New World Order has lost control.
[00:37:50.297 --> 00:37:51.058]  That's the key.
[00:37:51.478 --> 00:37:58.161]  They wanted an organized decline of the dollar, an organized decline of the West, an organized collapse to build their system on top.
[00:37:58.221 --> 00:38:02.103]  But like all tyrants, it's gotten out of their control.
[00:38:02.423 --> 00:38:07.406]  When they had us asleep, when they could do whatever they wanted, they thought they were gods, they were invincible.
[00:38:07.846 --> 00:38:15.806]   the world isn't going along which shows the power of humanity but also shows the
[00:38:15.806 --> 00:38:24.806]   power of destructiveness if now we don't fill the gap and fill in that vacuum. Now
[00:38:24.806 --> 00:38:30.166]   I was on with Steve Bannon for 45 minutes today and let me tell you I'm
[00:38:30.166 --> 00:38:33.925]   not kissing Steve Bannon's ass but when it comes to shows other than this one
[00:38:33.925 --> 00:38:37.684]  Tucker's there and there's Steve Bannon.
[00:38:36.227 --> 00:38:42.488]  I mean, the guest he's got, what he says is just absolutely critical to victory against tyranny.
[00:38:42.508 --> 00:38:49.331]   And he had former top Trump advisor Steve Cortez on, laying out What's really happening?
[00:38:49.351 --> 00:38:51.413]  The one thing he got wrong was saying it was an accident.
[00:38:51.453 --> 00:38:52.093]  It was a mistake.
[00:38:52.594 --> 00:39:00.320]  No, the globalists have been collapsing the economy, creating war on the streets and all of this by design for their Great Reset.
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.062]  Everything else he says is dead on.
[00:39:02.142 --> 00:39:03.743]  Here is the amazing analysis.
[00:39:04.304 --> 00:39:04.784]  Up to the break.
[00:39:04.804 --> 00:39:05.545]  We'll be back next hour.
[00:39:06.005 --> 00:39:07.607]  Steve Cortez, the floor is yours, sir.
[00:39:08.724 --> 00:39:14.430]  So listen, commercial real estate, I believe, is the biggest economic risk to every American's life.
[00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:18.414]  Even if you think you are uninvolved in commercial real estate, it matters to you.
[00:39:18.474 --> 00:39:20.116]  And let me lay out the reasons why.
[00:39:20.136 --> 00:39:23.960]  And this is my new article, The Syllabus of Economic Errors.
[00:39:24.039 --> 00:39:30.639]   And I titled that, by the way, to pay homage to Pius IX, who wrote the actual syllabus of errors.
[00:39:30.639 --> 00:39:34.318]   If we can show chart number four, by the way, let's have a quick laugh or a smile if we can
[00:39:34.318 --> 00:39:37.440]  before we start to cry about the syllabus of the errors.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.878]   So that's Joe Biden, of course, on the left, and that is Pius IX on the right.
[00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:43.159]  Which one of these two would you rather be governed by?
[00:39:43.159 --> 00:39:46.719]   I'll take the guy on the right any day who wrote the syllabus of errors.
[00:39:46.719 --> 00:39:52.360]   But getting to the errors, and these are sequential, and they are compounding over the last three years.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.599]   Why is commercial real estate in such a perilous condition right now?
[00:39:56.599 --> 00:40:01.639]   It starts with the lockdowns, the lockdowns of 2020, which were, of course, totally unscientific.
[00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:52.351]   And these are sequential and they are compounding over the last three years.
[00:39:52.351 --> 00:39:56.590]   Why is commercial real estate in such a perilous condition right now?
[00:39:56.590 --> 00:40:01.590]   It starts with the lockdowns, the lockdowns of 2020, which were of course totally unscientific.
[00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:05.829]   They were illogical, they were unfair, they were illegal in large part.
[00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:09.471]   But nonetheless, the lockdowns, one of the economic, there were so many dire consequences
[00:40:09.471 --> 00:40:13.550]   that we're still dealing with, social, physical, mental, from the lockdowns.
[00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:19.550]   But in terms of the economic consequences of the lockdowns, the lockdowns taught a lot of individuals by necessity,
[00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:23.471]   individuals and companies, both workers and employers, that they could effectively,
[00:40:23.471 --> 00:40:26.230]  or at least effectively enough, work from home.
[00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:31.190]   Okay, so that was the first predicate of this march toward a commercial real estate crisis.
[00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:34.990]  We then had in the summer of 2020, the BLM riots.
[00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.750]  We had violence and carnage all over the United States.
[00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:42.110]   And by the way, those same public health authorities, and I cite this in my article and give the links,
[00:40:28.166 --> 00:40:31.206]  of this march toward a commercial real estate crisis.
[00:40:31.206 --> 00:40:34.965]  We then had in the summer of 2020, the BLM riots.
[00:40:34.965 --> 00:40:37.765]  We had violence and carnage all over the United States.
[00:40:37.765 --> 00:40:42.126]   And by the way, those same public health authorities, and I cite this in my article and give the links,
[00:40:42.126 --> 00:40:46.926]   those very same public health authorities who told us that for our own safety, we had to stay home,
[00:40:46.926 --> 00:40:48.446]  remember this, never forget this.
[00:40:48.446 --> 00:40:50.446]  They said, "Oh, but you get a hall pass.
[00:40:50.446 --> 00:40:55.286]   "It's okay to congregate, it's okay to gather "as long as it's for BLM riots,
[00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:59.326]  "as long as it is for agitation for leftist narratives."
[00:40:59.326 --> 00:41:01.565]  They literally said that to us, okay?
[00:41:01.565 --> 00:41:09.126]   So the BLM riots of 2020 created such carnage, lasting violence to this day, decimating city centers
[00:41:09.126 --> 00:41:12.285]   around the United States that have effectively made them into no-go zones.
[00:41:12.285 --> 00:41:16.925]   I was just back, Steve, in my home city of Chicago, and on a regular workday, the Chicago Loop
[00:41:16.925 --> 00:41:21.166]   is practically a ghost town, and the few people that you do see roaming around
[00:41:21.166 --> 00:41:23.205]  are generally unsavory characters.
[00:41:23.205 --> 00:41:26.286]  The same kind of situation in downtown San Francisco.
[00:41:26.286 --> 00:41:29.646]   So we taught people by necessity that they have to work remotely,
[00:41:29.646 --> 00:41:31.086]  that they can work from home.
[00:41:30.851 --> 00:41:33.673]  We turned the city centers into dangerous no-go zones.
[00:41:33.993 --> 00:41:35.153]  What's the result?
[00:41:35.394 --> 00:41:41.457]  Well, the result is, unfortunately, massive spikes in vacancies in downtown office buildings.
[00:41:41.497 --> 00:41:42.157]  Not my opinion.
[00:41:42.417 --> 00:41:43.218]  Let's go to the charts.
[00:41:43.238 --> 00:41:45.059]  Let's look at chart number two, please, if we could.
[00:41:45.099 --> 00:41:47.640]  This is vacancy in downtown offices.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.081]  That chart goes all the way back to 2006.
[00:41:50.622 --> 00:41:54.564]  Notice the massive spike in vacancies right now at the far right end.
[00:41:55.204 --> 00:41:59.304]  that graph far worse than 2008, 2009.
[00:41:59.304 --> 00:42:02.724]   And Steve, as I said in the previous segment, most of the risks in '08 and '09
[00:42:02.724 --> 00:42:04.364]  were in the residential real estate sector.
[00:42:04.364 --> 00:42:05.525]  That's not the case now.
[00:42:05.525 --> 00:42:08.364]  The risks are in the commercial real estate sector.
[00:42:08.364 --> 00:42:13.344]   So moving on with the sequence of failures, with the syllabus of economic errors,
[00:42:13.344 --> 00:42:15.423]  what's the next massive error?
[00:42:15.423 --> 00:42:16.844]  Well, what did Joe Biden do?
[00:42:16.844 --> 00:42:20.525]   When he took office, he was handed a wonderful economic handoff
[00:42:20.525 --> 00:42:23.525]  of an economy that was recovering with low inflation.
[00:42:23.525 --> 00:42:24.364]  And what did he do?
[00:42:24.364 --> 00:42:29.764]   He engaged in absolutely exorbitant borrowing and spending with the help, with the assistance
[00:42:29.764 --> 00:42:34.005]   of collaborationist Republicans on Capitol Hill, particularly in the US Senate.
[00:42:34.005 --> 00:42:37.963]   So you take this situation, okay, of an already very vulnerable
[00:42:37.963 --> 00:42:41.724]   commercial real estate market, particularly as it pertains to office buildings,
[00:42:41.724 --> 00:42:45.804]  and you throw on top of that massive amounts of inflation.
[00:42:45.925 --> 00:42:48.447]  Inflation that was created by Joe Biden.
[00:42:48.527 --> 00:42:49.488]  Always remember that, folks.
[00:42:49.508 --> 00:42:50.328]  This isn't bad luck.
[00:42:50.348 --> 00:42:51.389]  This isn't a business cycle.
[00:42:51.629 --> 00:42:54.291]  This is a created crisis of inflation.
[00:42:54.311 --> 00:42:55.811]  And then what is the result from there?
[00:42:56.352 --> 00:42:58.713]  The result is bank failures, which we're now experiencing.
[00:42:58.733 --> 00:43:00.935]  So let's bring us all the way up to the present day.
[00:43:01.235 --> 00:43:06.555]   The Silicon Valley Bank failed for a lot of reasons, but as its depositors in tech who were suffering
[00:43:06.555 --> 00:43:10.153]   from the very inflation that Biden caused, as they were suffering from that inflation,
[00:43:10.153 --> 00:43:13.795]   as they were clamoring for cash and withdrawing their funds from the bank,
[00:43:13.795 --> 00:43:15.494]  the bank couldn't meet those obligations.
[00:43:15.494 --> 00:43:16.334]  Why?
[00:43:16.334 --> 00:43:21.555]   Because its bond holdings were getting killed because of Biden's inflation.
[00:43:21.555 --> 00:43:23.914]  So again, that's why I said these are compounding errors.
[00:43:23.914 --> 00:43:25.835]  One feeds off of the next.
[00:43:25.835 --> 00:43:29.315]   And what is the result of this bank crisis that we are presently in?
[00:43:29.315 --> 00:43:32.035]  We see a collapse in bank lending.
[00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:48.537]  If we can go to chart number three, this is a recent headline from Bloomberg talking about, and this is bringing it all the way to the present day, the most recent data we have, the last two weeks of March, bank lending, Steve, dropped by $105 billion with a B, $105 billion.
[00:43:48.937 --> 00:43:54.019]   That is the most in history in data that goes back a half Century.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.701]  So we now have a credit crunch.
[00:43:55.941 --> 00:43:59.123]  We have an absolute collapse in bank lending.
[00:43:59.383 --> 00:44:10.930]  That means that the American economy, particularly Main Street businesses, particularly smaller firms who rely on the smaller regional banks, have an absolute dearth, a desert of capital right now.
[00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.451]  Why?
[00:44:11.591 --> 00:44:13.432]  Because of this syllabus of errors.
[00:44:13.452 --> 00:44:20.857]  So I hope I have laid out in logical terms with facts and figures and charts how we got here and why these risks are so perilous.
[00:44:22.217 --> 00:44:24.438]  Elon Musk is suppressing Substack right now.
[00:44:24.478 --> 00:44:25.318]  Everybody knows that.
[00:44:25.478 --> 00:44:26.519]  How did they get to your Substack?
[00:44:26.539 --> 00:44:27.899]  How did it get to your social media, Steve?
[00:44:27.939 --> 00:44:29.240]  This is something people must read.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:30.360]  Yes, please.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.321]  SteveCortez.Substack.com.
[00:44:32.801 --> 00:44:35.442]  And I do link to it also on my social medias.
[00:44:35.582 --> 00:44:42.024]  On Twitter, I'm at SteveCortez with an S. Okay, so we're going to get Cortez on the show.
[00:44:42.064 --> 00:44:42.504]  Really smart guy.
[00:44:42.524 --> 00:44:43.365]  I've been following him for years.
[00:44:45.052 --> 00:44:46.994]  It's not a cascade of errors.
[00:44:47.074 --> 00:44:50.416]  It's a designed collapse of the economy the globalists admit they're doing.
[00:44:51.077 --> 00:44:54.640]  They don't just perfectly have the perfect errors in the perfect...
[00:44:55.948 --> 00:44:58.148]  Order to perfectly do it by accident.
[00:44:58.208 --> 00:45:01.789]  They admit they're doing it on purpose.
[00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:03.950]  And the good news is we can stop them.
[00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:08.091]  Because as soon as the public knows they're behind it, they'll have to back off, just like the shots.
[00:45:08.151 --> 00:45:09.511]  And I've got articles all over the world.
[00:45:10.171 --> 00:45:13.112]  Republicans force Biden to officially end COVID-19 emergency.
[00:45:13.132 --> 00:45:14.492]  A bunch of news on that.
[00:45:14.532 --> 00:45:17.993]  We have to keep hammering them and hammering them that they're behind it.
[00:45:18.313 --> 00:45:19.393]  They're not just idiots.
[00:45:20.964 --> 00:45:21.664]  Phones are loaded.
[00:45:22.345 --> 00:45:23.745]  Hour number two is about to begin.
[00:45:24.306 --> 00:45:29.369]  I'll intersperse a bunch of other news and breaking information I don't have time to get to yet when we start hour number two.
[00:45:29.449 --> 00:45:34.171]  Please, to millions of listeners and viewers, tell everybody you know and complete strangers, tune in now.
[00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:37.473]  Madmaxworld.tv, Infowars.com and local stations.
[00:45:37.452 --> 00:45:59.012]  We'll be right back.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:00.801]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:46:01.502 --> 00:46:02.984]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[00:46:03.024 --> 00:46:05.366]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[00:46:05.807 --> 00:46:07.829]  And it says political prisoner.
[00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:10.371]  With an image of President Trump.
[00:46:10.571 --> 00:46:12.673]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[00:46:13.013 --> 00:46:14.935]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:46:15.155 --> 00:46:21.419]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[00:46:21.739 --> 00:46:22.780]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.763]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:46:26.923 --> 00:46:28.484]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[00:46:28.524 --> 00:46:29.505]  No, I'm not running for President.
[00:46:29.545 --> 00:46:31.806]  It's a really nice navy blue high quality shirt.
[00:46:32.107 --> 00:46:32.787]  Red, white, and blue.
[00:46:32.887 --> 00:46:33.748]  Alex Jones for President.
[00:46:34.448 --> 00:46:37.250]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:39.132]  Great way to fund the operation.
[00:46:39.172 --> 00:46:48.439]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:55.491]  In an hour, Michael Cargill will be in studio with us.
[00:46:55.651 --> 00:46:58.793]  He's now won two major federal court victories for all our Second Amendment rights.
[00:46:58.813 --> 00:47:00.954]  He's got a lot of other big news to break down.
[00:47:00.974 --> 00:47:02.174]  Look forward to that.
[00:47:02.194 --> 00:47:03.835]  But right now, we're about to start taking your phone calls.
[00:47:04.615 --> 00:47:05.716]  Let's start going to him right now.
[00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:07.156]  Lee in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[00:47:07.176 --> 00:47:07.717]  Thanks for calling.
[00:47:09.437 --> 00:47:11.038]  Yes, thank you, Alex.
[00:47:11.298 --> 00:47:15.500]  I've just got a thought I've been kicking around, haven't had a lot of success with.
[00:47:16.235 --> 00:47:22.938]  Is there any reason a federal judge would not be able to issue warrants for the criminals in office?
[00:47:24.819 --> 00:47:31.122]  Well, in federal grand juries, we don't just put all the power on the judges, but the Justice Department controls those grand juries, but yes.
[00:47:32.623 --> 00:47:33.043]  Okay.
[00:47:34.504 --> 00:47:38.786]  Because I was wondering, and I tried to reach out to them, they're not easy to get in contact with.
[00:47:40.848 --> 00:47:43.089]  Well, most federal judges are politicians.
[00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:44.329]  I'm not saying they're all bad.
[00:47:44.349 --> 00:47:46.430]  There are a lot of good state court judges.
[00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:50.331]  The Democrats can pick the really bad jurisdictions they want to sue and go after Republicans.
[00:47:51.391 --> 00:48:02.715]  But, yeah, what we need is state grand juries to do what New York's done, but not from a position of fraud, from a position of strength and reality and start.
[00:48:02.735 --> 00:48:04.976]  I mean, why aren't state courts indicting?
[00:48:05.516 --> 00:48:08.337]  Why aren't state grand juries indicting Hunter Biden?
[00:48:09.343 --> 00:48:11.684]  Because that affects, those are crimes at the state level too.
[00:48:13.566 --> 00:48:14.126]  Absolutely.
[00:48:16.748 --> 00:48:19.109]  Yeah, that was my only question, Rush.
[00:48:19.189 --> 00:48:20.030]  Thank you.
[00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:21.250]  Keep up the great work.
[00:48:21.291 --> 00:48:21.951]  I'll try, brother.
[00:48:21.991 --> 00:48:23.472]  But that's the Pandora's box.
[00:48:24.312 --> 00:48:33.398]  That now the Democrats have indicted Trump, and they've done things, even if Trump's guilty, which I don't think he is, a thousand times worse, well then what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
[00:48:33.818 --> 00:48:34.779]  It's a two-way street.
[00:48:35.079 --> 00:48:37.741]  Justin in Georgia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:48:39.042 --> 00:48:42.684]  Hey Alex, I enjoyed your hit piece this morning on Steve Bannon.
[00:48:42.704 --> 00:48:43.764]  Really good job there.
[00:48:43.784 --> 00:48:44.204]  Thank you.
[00:48:44.224 --> 00:48:46.586]  Listen, I want to get straight to it.
[00:48:46.686 --> 00:48:48.707]  I think we got to get behind Trump.
[00:48:48.827 --> 00:48:51.228]  I know you got a lot of black-killed folks in here.
[00:48:51.288 --> 00:48:52.929]  Hey listen, I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:48:53.409 --> 00:48:54.890]  Your phone just started scrambling.
[00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:57.671]  So just stay right where you are and talk right into the receiver.
[00:49:01.153 --> 00:49:02.193]  Okay Alex, sorry about that.
[00:49:02.233 --> 00:49:05.114]  Listen, I think we got to get Trump back in office.
[00:49:05.255 --> 00:49:12.045]   I know you got a lot of black-killed people in your audience that are Ready to move on from Trump, but I don't believe there's anybody else.
[00:49:12.265 --> 00:49:15.969]  There's not a live player on the planet that can step in and do what Trump has done.
[00:49:16.029 --> 00:49:18.151]  He spent $70 billion on lawyers.
[00:49:18.675 --> 00:49:23.839]  Since he's left office, there's not a human being on the planet that would just not say, hey, I'm done with this.
[00:49:23.939 --> 00:49:25.039]  I'm going to go live my life.
[00:49:25.099 --> 00:49:26.921]  I got great- No, no, I tend to agree with you.
[00:49:27.001 --> 00:49:30.103]  After he's been through what he's been through, they're really going after him.
[00:49:30.163 --> 00:49:30.643]  It's real.
[00:49:30.964 --> 00:49:31.604]  They're going after me.
[00:49:31.664 --> 00:49:32.104]  It's real.
[00:49:32.184 --> 00:49:34.626]  I know it's real with him.
[00:49:34.666 --> 00:49:36.087]  They are so scared of him right now.
[00:49:36.467 --> 00:49:39.269]  We would be stupid to throw the baby out with the bathwater.
[00:49:39.289 --> 00:49:40.070]  I think that's what you're saying.
[00:49:40.954 --> 00:49:55.636]  Trump's not perfect, and by no means is he, but like if you look at his picks that he had, you know, personnel picks, people he put in his cabinet with him and stuff like that, he had to get a coalition government going or the rhinos would have just dropped the ball on him early on.
[00:49:56.061 --> 00:49:58.582]  And people talk about he didn't get nothing done during his first.
[00:49:59.143 --> 00:50:00.944]  You absolutely don't know how government works.
[00:50:01.044 --> 00:50:08.928]  Unless you have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, control of the White House and the House, you're generally not going to get anything done.
[00:50:08.948 --> 00:50:09.308]  Well, exactly.
[00:50:09.368 --> 00:50:11.249]  And it was good that he never ran for office.
[00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:15.352]  Nobody ever did that and won the presidency, other than George Washington.
[00:50:15.832 --> 00:50:17.773]  But then he didn't know what he was doing.
[00:50:17.833 --> 00:50:19.314]  He's gotten his education now.
[00:50:20.634 --> 00:50:22.795]  Hey, Tromba's fire, ain't no doubt about that.
[00:50:22.855 --> 00:50:26.537]  But like I said, there's not another live player on the planet that can step in.
[00:50:26.657 --> 00:50:35.921]  And after DeSantis had to walk back his comment the other day on Ukraine, you realize Trump's all alone in a sea of sea monsters.
[00:50:36.041 --> 00:50:36.761]  Well, that's it.
[00:50:36.821 --> 00:50:40.583]  I mean, I'm not in the lesser of two evils, but it's like a football game.
[00:50:40.983 --> 00:50:42.264]  Who are you going to put on the field?
[00:50:43.024 --> 00:50:44.405]  People can say, well, he's not perfect.
[00:50:44.465 --> 00:50:46.266]  He dropped the ball here and he did that.
[00:50:46.746 --> 00:50:49.568]  But he also scored some of the biggest touchdowns and victories we ever had.
[00:50:49.588 --> 00:50:52.750]  And he's gotten rid of Jared Kushner.
[00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:54.791]  I have a good feeling about Trump right now.
[00:50:54.831 --> 00:50:56.051]  I mean, he's under attack.
[00:50:56.412 --> 00:50:57.092]  He's in battle.
[00:50:57.172 --> 00:50:58.052]  That's why I'm supporting him.
[00:50:58.973 --> 00:51:03.275]  If you look at his policy videos, it's enough to have gotten other men killed.
[00:51:03.315 --> 00:51:07.698]  Look, Kennedy talked about a monolithic conspiracy that we're surrounded by.
[00:51:08.234 --> 00:51:09.114]  Later he's gone.
[00:51:09.154 --> 00:51:10.675]  They did the same thing with Nixon.
[00:51:10.915 --> 00:51:13.256]  They shot Reagan.
[00:51:13.596 --> 00:51:22.320]  I just don't see how the guy has been able to walk this fine line of doing what he needs to do, expose the deep state to the American people and not get shot in the process.
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.821]  That is powerfully said.
[00:51:24.021 --> 00:51:26.102]  Presidents have been killed for saying far less.
[00:51:26.522 --> 00:51:30.804]  What he is saying is causing irreparable harm to the New World Order.
[00:51:30.864 --> 00:51:31.304]  Great call.
[00:51:31.824 --> 00:51:33.664]  All right, we're taking your phone calls in this hour.
[00:51:33.684 --> 00:51:35.545]  All the huge global developments are taking place.
[00:51:36.105 --> 00:51:43.687]  Ronald Cargill, who's won two major federal appellate court victories, overturning two major gun control laws of Biden and Trump.
[00:51:44.407 --> 00:51:53.909]  He's going to be joining us in studio with a lot more and the justified shooting that the court and the jury ruled was murder last week.
[00:51:57.225 --> 00:51:58.465]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[00:51:58.485 --> 00:52:00.766]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[00:52:00.626 --> 00:52:04.865]   in Austin, Texas. He'll be with us next hour. We're taking your calls right now. I noticed
[00:52:04.865 --> 00:52:11.225]   one of the callers, Craig in California, wanted to talk about the movie in the mid-1970s,
[00:52:11.225 --> 00:52:16.144]   Network. And so before we go to Craig and Aaron, everybody else, I wanted to play a
[00:52:16.144 --> 00:52:20.985]   short clip so folks would know in context what he's talking about. Here's a clip.
[00:52:20.985 --> 00:52:27.066]   I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's
[00:52:27.066 --> 00:52:29.865]  out of work or scared of losing their job.
[00:52:29.865 --> 00:52:39.865]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:52:30.949 --> 00:52:32.490]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[00:52:32.951 --> 00:52:33.991]  Banks are going bust.
[00:52:34.051 --> 00:52:35.972]  Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
[00:52:36.613 --> 00:52:40.775]  Punks are running wild in the street and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it!
[00:52:42.409 --> 00:52:42.810]  We know.
[00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:46.494]  The air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat.
[00:52:47.234 --> 00:52:55.764]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
[00:52:56.044 --> 00:52:58.107]  We know things are bad, worse than bad.
[00:52:58.707 --> 00:52:59.427]  They're crazy.
[00:52:59.647 --> 00:53:02.669]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[00:53:03.049 --> 00:53:09.971]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[00:53:10.011 --> 00:53:14.353]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-built-in radios and I won't say anything.
[00:53:14.573 --> 00:53:15.394]  Just leave us alone.
[00:53:15.634 --> 00:53:17.034]  Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone.
[00:53:17.874 --> 00:53:18.975]  I want you to get mad!
[00:53:20.177 --> 00:53:21.158]  I don't want you to protest.
[00:53:21.258 --> 00:53:22.239]  I don't want you to riot.
[00:53:22.259 --> 00:53:25.221]  I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[00:53:25.581 --> 00:53:29.884]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
[00:53:30.225 --> 00:53:32.767]  All I know is that first, you've got to get mad!
[00:53:33.207 --> 00:53:35.108]  You've got to say, I'm a human being!
[00:53:35.208 --> 00:53:35.969]  God damn it!
[00:53:36.389 --> 00:53:37.590]  My life has value!
[00:53:40.973 --> 00:53:44.315]  So, I want you to get up now.
[00:53:45.636 --> 00:53:47.678]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[00:53:49.016 --> 00:53:59.330]  I want you to get up right now, and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'M AS MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
[00:54:00.572 --> 00:54:02.033]  I want you to get up right now.
[00:54:02.733 --> 00:54:10.475]  Get up, go to your windows, open them and stick your head out and yell, I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.
[00:54:10.535 --> 00:54:11.496]  Things have got to change.
[00:54:11.556 --> 00:54:14.477]  How many stations does this go up like?
[00:54:14.497 --> 00:54:14.477]  67.
[00:54:14.557 --> 00:54:15.997]  I know it goes to Louisville and Atlanta.
[00:54:16.017 --> 00:54:17.518]  We're not going to take this anymore.
[00:54:17.778 --> 00:54:21.819]  Then we'll figure out what to do about the depression and the inflation and the oil crisis.
[00:54:22.039 --> 00:54:32.082]   But first, get up out of your chairs, open the window, stick your head out and yell and say, I'm as mad as hell and I'm I'm not gonna take this anymore!
[00:54:32.082 --> 00:54:41.582]  Alright, Craig.
[00:54:40.826 --> 00:54:42.887]  Well, that's quite the intro for a caller.
[00:54:42.907 --> 00:54:48.689]  You were talking about the movie, The Mid-1970s Network, that's excellent, where they sit him down and explain the New World Order to him.
[00:54:48.709 --> 00:54:50.049]  Boy, you talk about a globalist message.
[00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:51.950]  It is it.
[00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:53.171]  Craig, you're on the air.
[00:54:53.211 --> 00:54:54.191]  What's your take on that?
[00:54:55.222 --> 00:54:56.522]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[00:54:56.542 --> 00:54:59.843]  You know, I'll tell you, I think it's about that time, don't you?
[00:54:59.863 --> 00:55:02.924]  I'm as mad as hell and I ain't gonna take it anymore.
[00:55:03.604 --> 00:55:12.566]  Well, maybe at a designated time we can kind of get a kind of a feel for who our neighbors are and who's on board to where you, you know, because people won't talk to one another.
[00:55:13.026 --> 00:55:16.667]  But if you hear a guy two doors down yelling, I'm mad as hell, I ain't gonna take it anymore.
[00:55:16.807 --> 00:55:18.768]  Now you got somebody you know you can go over and talk to.
[00:55:18.808 --> 00:55:24.669]  You just said that's why I spent this segment yesterday when I was in Seymour Crowder's office.
[00:55:26.033 --> 00:55:27.874]  Saying, when I go out, all I get is love.
[00:55:27.894 --> 00:55:30.055]  It wasn't about, oh, I'm great, oh, I'm wonderful.
[00:55:30.395 --> 00:55:33.537]  I'm in battle, barely still on air, because people don't realize the power they have.
[00:55:33.597 --> 00:55:37.619]  I tell you, all I get is positive feedback because I've been around 29 years on air.
[00:55:37.639 --> 00:55:39.140]  I just get a lot of negative feedback.
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:44.623]  We must be winning with the feedback I'm getting, but individuals don't know because they're locked in their houses.
[00:55:45.837 --> 00:55:46.357]  Exactly.
[00:55:46.417 --> 00:55:51.060]  So if we stuck our head out, maybe, you know, if nothing else, do a little listening.
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:56:00.585]  Because if we designated a certain time between this time and that time to yell out your window to where it's not all at the same time, because if you're yelling, you can't hear somebody else yell.
[00:56:01.005 --> 00:56:02.886]  It's too hard to coordinate something like that.
[00:56:02.986 --> 00:56:08.608]  I think it's good to knock on your neighbor's doors and ask them what they know about the New World Order and go to city council and speak.
[00:56:08.628 --> 00:56:09.688]  You'll meet like-minded people there.
[00:56:09.508 --> 00:56:13.347]   there. But I don't think it's bad to yell I'm mad as hell or put a flag up or put a
[00:56:13.347 --> 00:56:15.948]   sign up on your house if you're mad about the state of the country come talk to me.
[00:56:15.948 --> 00:56:21.027]   I mean I I I I I. It would be kind of a novelty just to be able to you know put your ear to
[00:56:21.027 --> 00:56:24.908]   the window and start hearing people around the neighborhood yelling at you. Okay I'll
[00:56:24.908 --> 00:56:30.707]   tell you what. Tonight at 7pm I'll walk out and I'll scream in my front yard I'm mad as
[00:56:31.345 --> 00:56:33.547]  My neighbors are going to be inside watching TV, they're not going to hear me.
[00:56:33.587 --> 00:56:37.211]  I'm not poo-pooing your idea, I'm saying this is a metaphor in the movie.
[00:56:37.592 --> 00:56:46.860]   What is a modern way to do What he says, go to a banner hang, go stand with a sign on the street corner, go to city council, go to school board.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:49.262]  I mean, what do you think a modern version of that is?
[00:56:50.259 --> 00:57:03.945]  Well, my only defense is, you know, I don't play the game with these people, and I'm very outspoken, and any time that they are trying to get me to comply to some ridiculous thing, I let it be known.
[00:57:04.185 --> 00:57:06.966]  I don't care who's around me, how I feel about the whole situation.
[00:57:07.327 --> 00:57:15.590]  Well, exactly, and I think we do it every day at work, and church, and business, and life, to speak out and be heard.
[00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:16.270]  Beautiful call.
[00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:17.011]  Thank you so much.
[00:57:18.318 --> 00:57:21.119]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Aaron in Kansas.
[00:57:21.139 --> 00:57:21.959]  You're on the air, Aaron.
[00:57:22.959 --> 00:57:23.539]  Hey, Alex.
[00:57:23.879 --> 00:57:25.880]  Just wanted to say I love you guys.
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:26.860]  Keep up the great work.
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:28.080]  Love you, too.
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:30.761]  Hey, I wanted to bring up something.
[00:57:31.141 --> 00:57:34.641]  Most callers I never really hear talk about anything with Catholicism.
[00:57:34.661 --> 00:57:38.722]  I want to know if you know anybody by the name of Carlo Mario Pagano.
[00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:42.623]  He used to be the Archbishop, basically, of the United States.
[00:57:44.978 --> 00:57:52.183]  Yeah, I mean, I've heard that name.
[00:57:52.324 --> 00:57:57.467]  I'm not a Catholic, but some of my best friends are Catholics, and I think Catholics are like our whole Christian community.
[00:57:57.908 --> 00:58:01.931]  Some are active, some are conservative, some are engaged, others are leftist.
[00:58:02.291 --> 00:58:07.375]  And so you can look at one horrible leftist cardinal or bishop, and you can look at a great one.
[00:58:07.755 --> 00:58:10.817]  So we've got all these great Catholics at the tip of the spear fighting tyranny.
[00:58:11.678 --> 00:58:16.342]  They're wonderful, beautiful people, and they're so close to Christ, and then you've got other people that are against it.
[00:58:16.382 --> 00:58:17.864]  I mean, look at Pope John Paul II.
[00:58:17.884 --> 00:58:20.266]  I mean, almost everything he said I agree with.
[00:58:20.326 --> 00:58:24.489]  A great man, you know, incredible speeches, stood up against communism.
[00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:27.392]  And then you look at the next pope, he was kind of bad.
[00:58:27.432 --> 00:58:28.433]  The new one's horrible.
[00:58:28.893 --> 00:58:29.634]  They're just men.
[00:58:29.954 --> 00:58:33.357]  But I understand that, you know, they lead a bunch of Catholics, so I don't attack them.
[00:58:35.359 --> 00:58:39.800]  I think at the end of the day, that yeah, there's been a major struggle for the heart and soul of the Catholic Church.
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.180]  There's been a struggle for everything.
[00:58:41.481 --> 00:58:48.562]  And I can't sit here and bash the Catholic Church for being pro-globalist part of the time, because you look at the Protestant churches, where are they?
[00:58:49.182 --> 00:58:50.243]  They're not doing anything either.
[00:58:50.363 --> 00:58:52.623]  So let he without sin cast the first stone.
[00:58:52.643 --> 00:58:54.484]  But I remember that name you're talking about.
[00:58:54.504 --> 00:58:58.765]  I know about some of the current cardinals and bishops that are speaking out against the new order so eloquently.
[00:58:59.125 --> 00:59:02.125]  But tell us about this person you're bringing up.
[00:59:03.126 --> 00:59:03.526]  Exactly.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:34.533]   He wrote a, or there's a book about him, I'm not sure if he wrote it, it's called A Voice in the Wilderness, and he really just puts them together, and it's basically the same big cabal that you've been exposing for the past probably 30 years now, but you see the FBI going to investigate what they call extremists, and they're going to a Latin mass, and I've heard the devil hates Latin, so... Oh, there's no doubt that the New World Order is attacking conservative Catholics, because anything original, they're attacking the Bring it on.
[00:59:34.353 --> 00:59:37.271]   Orthodox Church because it's old, they're attacking the Catholic Church because it's
[00:59:37.271 --> 00:59:42.072]   old, they are scared of its potential because they've only partially conquered it.
[00:59:42.072 --> 00:59:46.913]   And so they are definitely after traditionalist real Catholics.
[00:59:46.913 --> 00:59:48.913]  You can, it's 100% real.
[00:59:48.913 --> 00:59:54.673]   I mean Homeland Security internally said conservative Catholics are the number one threat.
[00:59:54.673 --> 00:59:56.273]  Oh wow.
[00:59:56.273 --> 00:59:58.793]  Bring it on.
[00:59:58.793 --> 00:59:59.992]  Let's go.
[00:59:59.992 --> 01:00:00.992]  It's scary brother.
[01:00:00.992 --> 01:00:01.992]  I hear you.
[01:00:01.992 --> 01:00:02.992]  I appreciate your call.
[01:00:02.992 --> 01:00:06.833]  anything traditionalist.
[01:00:05.739 --> 01:00:07.887]  Because they've got a new world order.
[01:00:07.907 --> 01:00:09.231]  That means everything else goes.
[01:00:09.969 --> 01:00:10.950]  Phil in Long Island.
[01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:12.330]  I can't go to Phil yet.
[01:00:12.370 --> 01:00:12.971]  I gotta go to break.
[01:00:13.011 --> 01:00:13.251]  Sorry.
[01:00:13.271 --> 01:00:13.891]  I'd look at the clock.
[01:00:14.652 --> 01:00:18.414]  Phil wants to talk about Steve Mann and Trump and the China kingpins.
[01:00:19.434 --> 01:00:20.395]  And so we'll go to break.
[01:00:20.535 --> 01:00:27.438]  Come back with Phil and then John and Brian and Dave and Scott and Dustin and Mike and Lori and the order your calls are received.
[01:00:27.478 --> 01:00:30.380]  And then Mike Collargill will be in studio.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.581]  Talk about a guy on fire.
[01:00:31.601 --> 01:00:32.901]  A guy that has victory in his hands.
[01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:35.563]  Everything he touches has success.
[01:00:35.583 --> 01:00:37.004]  I don't want to jinx him, but it's kind of true.
[01:00:37.984 --> 01:00:40.346]  He just is constantly making the news around the country and locally.
[01:00:40.366 --> 01:00:42.707]  So I look forward to him in studio.
[01:00:43.128 --> 01:00:44.008]  Banned on video.
[01:00:44.188 --> 01:00:45.229]  InfoWars.com.

[01:01:03.132 --> 01:01:05.573]  And we are back to the Alex Jones Show, going right back to your phone calls.
[01:01:05.713 --> 01:01:08.354]  Phil in Long Island, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:01:08.374 --> 01:01:08.754]  Go ahead.
[01:01:10.335 --> 01:01:12.596]  Hey Alex, thanks very much for taking my call.
[01:01:12.896 --> 01:01:29.942]  Kudos to you and the crew for doing such a great job and saw you on Bannon this morning and that was awesome and it brought to mind something that I feel is extremely important that is being missed by a lot of even the alternative media and that is the arrest and imprisonment of Myles Guow.
[01:01:30.848 --> 01:01:34.191]  Okay, you probably know he's a close associate of Steve Bannon.
[01:01:34.671 --> 01:01:38.274]  He's a Chinese dissident that has been living here since 2014.
[01:01:38.374 --> 01:01:46.101]  Oh, he's been totally targeted for the CHICOMS by China Joe because he's helping to try to overthrow the CHICOMS.
[01:01:46.141 --> 01:01:48.243]  Totally innocent, totally harassed.
[01:01:48.503 --> 01:01:49.364]  It's just, it's criminal.
[01:01:50.797 --> 01:02:00.267]  Absolutely, but the thing is here is that he is a linchpin to a lot of the things that are going on today, not just with the CCP, but he's got information dating back on the Clintons.
[01:02:01.568 --> 01:02:08.496]  He was arrested by the FBI, and then six hours after he was arrested, they burned his apartment down in New York City.
[01:02:09.176 --> 01:02:09.717]  He was arraigned.
[01:02:09.737 --> 01:02:13.000]  That's right, because he's organizing Chinese dissidents.
[01:02:13.661 --> 01:02:23.193]  And Falon Gong and doing an incredible, I mean all the groups he funds, all the things he's behind, for listeners that don't know, he's heavily involved in so much of the resistance, that's why they're going after him.
[01:02:24.688 --> 01:02:25.268]  Exactly.
[01:02:25.448 --> 01:02:29.909]  And, you know, the thing is, is I think the news has to get out much more strongly.
[01:02:29.969 --> 01:02:32.290]  I would love to see you guys and Tucker.
[01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:35.070]  And I think Tucker said a few words about him.
[01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:38.031]  I heard Doug Hagman did a few things on him last week.
[01:02:39.051 --> 01:02:46.572]  You know, the stuff... Yeah, well they arrested him saying he did a fundraiser to fight China and that he might have kept some of the money.
[01:02:46.712 --> 01:02:49.133]  Well, how the hell do you build an organization and not...
[01:02:49.773 --> 01:02:51.173]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:02:51.713 --> 01:02:57.415]  He's financing, I mean, all the groups he's financing, all I see is major resistance to the groups he finances.
[01:02:57.895 --> 01:03:05.877]  So, Christ said Judge Atreba has fruits, and what I've seen him fund has been Mike Tyson-ing, Muhammad Ali-ing the globalists.
[01:03:06.577 --> 01:03:07.757]  Absolutely.
[01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:10.518]  Yeah, that's why they're putting him in jail.
[01:03:10.598 --> 01:03:12.958]  I know they arrested him and suddenly his apartment set on fire.
[01:03:13.599 --> 01:03:15.019]  What do you think that's all about?
[01:03:16.573 --> 01:03:20.936]  Well, they say he has information on Biden's laptop.
[01:03:21.757 --> 01:03:25.099]  And so instead of them taking that into custody, they just torched it.
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.521]  Right, right.
[01:03:27.641 --> 01:03:29.282]  And he had information also.
[01:03:29.883 --> 01:03:35.347]  He broke the story about the Chinese using the VACs as an attack against the U.S.
[01:03:35.387 --> 01:03:36.928]  military like two years ago.
[01:03:37.308 --> 01:03:38.949]  He was the first guy talking about Huawei?
[01:03:40.714 --> 01:03:42.155]  Yes, that's right, that's right.
[01:03:42.175 --> 01:03:46.598]  I mean, this guy is a linchpin to a lot of stuff, and I'm afraid he's going to get etched in.
[01:03:46.938 --> 01:03:56.265]  And one more thing, just before you let me go, one of your callers earlier said something about getting everybody to go out there and show a sign that they're standing for what's going on here.
[01:03:56.625 --> 01:03:59.848]  I've been flying my flag upside down since Inauguration Day 2021.
[01:04:00.028 --> 01:04:03.911]  And for those that don't know, that's not a sign of disrespect.
[01:04:04.291 --> 01:04:06.773]  That's when something is in crisis, in distress.
[01:04:08.038 --> 01:04:16.600]  Right, and actually, Owen covered this last week, and I felt compelled to call, and then today I just figured I'd mention it because somebody else brought it up.
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.561]  It's a great way to see other patriots out there.
[01:04:19.881 --> 01:04:26.882]  You fly the flag upside down because the nation is in distress, and you'll know that you're looking at or talking to someone who is of a white mind.
[01:04:26.962 --> 01:04:29.603]  And if your neighbor's dumb and comes over and says, why are you disrespecting?
[01:04:29.623 --> 01:04:33.124]  You can pull up online or in a book and say, no, it means the country's in distress.
[01:04:33.484 --> 01:04:34.444]  You don't agree it's in distress?
[01:04:36.632 --> 01:04:37.633]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:37.913 --> 01:04:38.694]  Exactly right.
[01:04:38.954 --> 01:04:44.257]  I mean, I had my across the street neighbor's a veteran and he complained about it and he asked me to fly it right.
[01:04:44.337 --> 01:04:46.999]  I explained what I was doing and then he was okay with it.
[01:04:47.039 --> 01:04:51.702]  He said, okay, just do me a favor on Veterans Day, turn it right side up, which I did to respect him.
[01:04:52.223 --> 01:04:58.427]  But it's a good sign for people to see a flag lying upside down means that the guy, he's been red pilled.
[01:04:59.367 --> 01:04:59.868]  Absolutely.
[01:04:59.888 --> 01:05:01.128]  And again, your neighbor didn't know.
[01:05:01.229 --> 01:05:01.969]  He means well.
[01:05:02.609 --> 01:05:04.631]  That's out of respect to fly it upside down.
[01:05:04.931 --> 01:05:07.313]  The damn country is in crisis.
[01:05:07.373 --> 01:05:08.053]  Thanks for the call.
[01:05:09.434 --> 01:05:10.395]  John in Long Island.
[01:05:10.415 --> 01:05:10.935]  You're on the air.
[01:05:10.955 --> 01:05:11.396]  Go ahead.
[01:05:13.077 --> 01:05:13.717]  Hey, Alex.
[01:05:14.118 --> 01:05:17.960]  I'm calling to see if you've ever heard about a company called Rent-a-Kill Terminex.
[01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:23.925]  It is the largest extermination company in the world, both commercially and... Can I say the name again?
[01:05:25.005 --> 01:05:26.446]  Rent-a-Kill Terminex.
[01:05:26.827 --> 01:05:28.168]  Oh, I've seen the ads for Terminex.
[01:05:28.228 --> 01:05:28.388]  Yeah.
[01:05:29.713 --> 01:05:36.939]  Yeah, but it's Rentokil bought out Terminex and became the largest extermination company in the world and it quadrupled the chemical output.
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:43.325]  They have been acquiring every single predominant extermination company in the United States.
[01:05:43.585 --> 01:05:51.933]  They're headquartered and started in the United Kingdom and they have a headquarters in Canada and they have companies all around the whole world they've been acquiring.
[01:05:52.693 --> 01:06:04.894]   It's like a whole global takeover where they're choking out Well, the globalists have unlimited money, so they're definitely involved in a forced vertical integration.
[01:06:05.234 --> 01:06:07.437]  So how does Terminix tie into things?
[01:06:09.259 --> 01:06:18.929]  What's going on is they're implementing a new program with their pest stuff, which goes quarterly, their treatments, and they have quadrupled the amount of chemicals.
[01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:23.218]  Hold on, your phone's really breaking up, but I'm intrigued by this.
[01:06:23.358 --> 01:06:23.838]  I want to hear it.
[01:06:24.378 --> 01:06:28.781]  Move it to a different spot in your house, or your business, or wherever you're at, so I can hear you.
[01:06:28.961 --> 01:06:29.682]  Alright.
[01:06:29.802 --> 01:06:31.022]  Hold on, just hold on for a second.
[01:06:31.243 --> 01:06:32.443]  I'm going to go back to you, John.
[01:06:33.884 --> 01:06:38.187]  If a company wants to make money, they would do the limited amount of pesticide that actually works.
[01:06:38.827 --> 01:06:43.790]  Why would they triple the amount of chemical, the pesticide being released?
[01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:45.031]  To me, that's a big question.
[01:06:45.491 --> 01:06:47.232]  I'm just taking it as what you're saying is true.
[01:06:47.852 --> 01:06:48.733]  Where are you going with this?
[01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.396]  They're just pumping out a lot more chemical.
[01:06:54.436 --> 01:06:57.278]  I feel like it's more poisonous to the environment, to the food.
[01:06:57.318 --> 01:06:59.720]  But are you saying they've tripled their business?
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.461]  Or they've tripled the application?
[01:07:03.062 --> 01:07:06.584]  They've tripled the amount of chemical that we put out on a regular quarterly service.
[01:07:06.624 --> 01:07:07.825]  More than quadrupled it actually.
[01:07:08.505 --> 01:07:09.526]  And it's the nasty stuff.
[01:07:09.546 --> 01:07:10.426]  The stuff that leaches.
[01:07:10.466 --> 01:07:12.007]  And they've added granulars to it.
[01:07:12.147 --> 01:07:13.888]  Stuff that we normally would not do.
[01:07:14.289 --> 01:07:15.609]  We would go after targeted things.
[01:07:15.689 --> 01:07:19.860]   And now they're making it Well then, okay, you're an exterminator it sounds like.
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:20.841]  Why do you think they're doing it?
[01:07:22.302 --> 01:07:26.005]  I think they're doing it to leach the stuff into the ground to jack up the water system.
[01:07:26.726 --> 01:07:31.309]  As well as to choke out any small business owners so that people have to all work for them.
[01:07:33.191 --> 01:07:36.634]  Well yeah, because I mean, you're like, damn there's no bugs around here and you got liver cancer.
[01:07:37.094 --> 01:07:40.316]  So you're saying they're just going thermonuclear with the pesticide?
[01:07:41.678 --> 01:07:43.079]  Yeah.
[01:07:43.419 --> 01:07:46.942]  And it's the largest company in the world now.
[01:07:47.659 --> 01:07:48.640]  All right, I'll look into it.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.141]  Thank you so much.
[01:07:50.801 --> 01:07:52.682]  Great points, but I can barely understand what you're saying.
[01:07:53.463 --> 01:07:54.023]  I'm not mad.
[01:07:54.063 --> 01:07:55.764]  I get cell phones get worse and worse.
[01:07:56.524 --> 01:07:59.166]  Joe Rogan, like in 2000, was at a comedy club I was watching.
[01:07:59.186 --> 01:08:00.567]  He goes, you know, it's the year 2000.
[01:08:00.627 --> 01:08:05.430]  We're supposed to be George Jetson and flying around in silver outfits on jet packs.
[01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:08.732]  But instead, I stand behind a bush, my cell phone craps out.
[01:08:09.392 --> 01:08:10.793]  And that really is where we are.
[01:08:10.813 --> 01:08:12.935]  We're going to go to break in a couple minutes.
[01:08:13.712 --> 01:08:16.855]  We're gonna come back with Lori and others straight ahead.
[01:08:17.375 --> 01:08:25.041]  But really, I might poo-poo in the last caller, but you're calling about some issue like an extermination company, and I gotta be honest, I don't know about it.
[01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:26.803]  I know this.
[01:08:28.264 --> 01:08:30.406]  The globalists have unlimited fake money they've made.
[01:08:32.387 --> 01:08:35.810]  And they're using it to buy up everything, to have control.
[01:08:37.692 --> 01:08:42.416]  So as a rule, if I can go with a mom and pop, I still use big guys sometimes when I have a choice.
[01:08:43.655 --> 01:08:44.476]  I'm in the middle of nowhere.
[01:08:44.496 --> 01:08:45.176]  I need ammunition.
[01:08:45.196 --> 01:08:45.937]  I forgot to bring ammo.
[01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:47.198]  Oh, there's a Walmart.
[01:08:47.318 --> 01:08:47.759]  I go to it.
[01:08:47.799 --> 01:08:50.741]  But I'll first search and say, is there a local gun shop?
[01:08:51.241 --> 01:08:56.346]  Even if I pay 23% more, I go to a little gun shop because you've got to empower a little community.
[01:08:56.846 --> 01:08:59.308]  Once they get rid of the real economy, it's over.
[01:09:00.029 --> 01:09:05.433]  And all the big corporations are working for new lockdowns, total control, social credit score, universal basic income.
[01:09:05.453 --> 01:09:07.255]  So we've got to shop local.
[01:09:07.976 --> 01:09:09.357]  That is such an important thing.
[01:09:10.237 --> 01:09:11.459]  Got to go to the farmer's market.
[01:09:12.458 --> 01:09:17.822]  Got to just start those basic moves in promoting independent free systems.
[01:09:18.262 --> 01:09:19.883]  Every week I get Amish milk.
[01:09:20.363 --> 01:09:20.664]  Love it.
[01:09:20.744 --> 01:09:21.084]  Drink it.
[01:09:21.184 --> 01:09:21.584]  Delicious.
[01:09:21.624 --> 01:09:22.064]  It's real.
[01:09:22.084 --> 01:09:23.265]  It's like a probiotic.
[01:09:23.786 --> 01:09:24.886]  My family loves it.
[01:09:25.507 --> 01:09:29.830]  And I'm not going to save the world doing that, but those little choices build the future.
[01:09:30.290 --> 01:09:35.613]  Lori, we're going to go to break and come back with you and so many others like Dave.
[01:09:36.682 --> 01:09:39.824]  And Mike, and others, and Dustin, stay with us.
[01:09:40.405 --> 01:09:45.248]  Infowars.com, Madmaxworld.tv, Madmaxworld.tv.
[01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:47.350]  TurboForce is back in stock.
[01:09:48.035 --> 01:09:52.399]  All right, next hour, Michael Cargill has won two major federal court cases for the Second Amendment.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:10:01.888]  He's got all the intel on what really happened with that ruling last Friday with the George Soros DA saying the Army veteran couldn't shoot a guy aiming a gun at him during a BLM rally.
[01:10:02.449 --> 01:10:05.992]  That's all coming up next hour, but let's go back to your calls right now.
[01:10:06.052 --> 01:10:06.613]  You're on the air.
[01:10:06.673 --> 01:10:08.454]  Lori from Michigan, thank you for calling.
[01:10:09.475 --> 01:10:09.956]  Hi, Alex.
[01:10:11.966 --> 01:10:12.726]  Long time listener.
[01:10:12.866 --> 01:10:13.407]  I'm a vet.
[01:10:13.587 --> 01:10:15.207]  More importantly, I'm a daughter.
[01:10:15.287 --> 01:10:15.907]  I'm a mom.
[01:10:15.968 --> 01:10:16.708]  I'm a sister.
[01:10:17.388 --> 01:10:20.969]  And I've been watching everything that's going on, trying to inform myself.
[01:10:21.149 --> 01:10:29.072]  And I guess my biggest question is, everything they're hitting us with, they're doing it somewhat slowly, but they're starting to speed up.
[01:10:29.272 --> 01:10:32.854]  When do we know when it's time to get the hell out of Dodge and cut and run?
[01:10:33.314 --> 01:10:35.955]  Because I'm in the suburbs, but I'm not in the country.
[01:10:37.557 --> 01:10:42.020]  You know, that's really the big question, the $64 trillion question.
[01:10:42.501 --> 01:10:44.082]  I think that's up to you and your area.
[01:10:44.382 --> 01:10:45.703]  Do you have a neighborhood that's awake?
[01:10:46.223 --> 01:10:47.224]  Do you have people you trust?
[01:10:47.284 --> 01:10:48.325]  Are your police good?
[01:10:49.506 --> 01:10:55.010]  But I think everybody should be trying to get 10 acres, 20 acres, 50 acres in the middle of nowhere in case things collapse.
[01:10:55.050 --> 01:11:00.874]  I think you... I would be 80% offense trying to stop the globalist, 20% defense with a backup.
[01:11:00.894 --> 01:11:01.415]  That's what I've done.
[01:11:02.242 --> 01:11:05.023]  And I've been trying to prep for, you know, slowly.
[01:11:05.143 --> 01:11:15.746]  I'm nowhere near the stage of some people, but I've been trying to build up slowly so that if I do have to take my family and get out, you know, I have something to start with.
[01:11:16.306 --> 01:11:21.587]  But, you know, it comes down to I'm one of those people that's living paycheck to paycheck.
[01:11:21.687 --> 01:11:22.347]  No, I understand.
[01:11:22.507 --> 01:11:23.388]  So many people are.
[01:11:23.448 --> 01:11:23.808]  It's hard.
[01:11:25.863 --> 01:11:26.503]  I totally understand.
[01:11:26.523 --> 01:11:30.905]  Well, at least you're not in New York City where they run public service announcements that there's a nuclear attack.
[01:11:31.385 --> 01:11:32.445]  Tune into your local radio.
[01:11:32.845 --> 01:11:38.287]  If there's a nuclear attack, folks, there won't be internet, there won't be radio, there won't be gas, there won't be electricity, there won't be sewage.
[01:11:38.707 --> 01:11:49.331]  So the first step is don't be in L.A., don't be in New York City, don't be in Austin, don't be in Houston, don't be in Miami, you know, don't be in Seattle.
[01:11:49.551 --> 01:11:50.431]  That's the first step.
[01:11:51.011 --> 01:11:52.652]  So, you know, that's where we're at.
[01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:59.750]  There's nothing industrial left much in Detroit, so you don't have to worry about how much of a target.
[01:12:01.381 --> 01:12:04.783]  Ah, we've got the entire auto industry up here.
[01:12:04.863 --> 01:12:07.284]  No, I know they make tanks up there and stuff.
[01:12:07.904 --> 01:12:08.785]  I mean, I was joking.
[01:12:09.405 --> 01:12:10.585]  Detroit's obviously a target.
[01:12:11.066 --> 01:12:12.787]  I mean, look, I'm in the same boat.
[01:12:13.327 --> 01:12:17.389]  I mean, I care about my children, my family, but most of my children are grown.
[01:12:17.769 --> 01:12:24.652]  They listen to me, but if I told them, hey, we're moving to Idaho, or we're moving to Montana, or we're moving to Timbuktu, they probably wouldn't go with me.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.961]  I mean, I'm in the same boat as you.
[01:12:28.001 --> 01:12:32.045]  I think it's a big debate and a big discussion we should have.
[01:12:32.165 --> 01:12:39.251]  And what would you say would be one of the top things we should look for before we get stuck in a 15-minute city?
[01:12:40.458 --> 01:12:45.560]  You know, I would have to get the preeminent expert, Joel Skousen, on for like two hours.
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:47.541]  Let's set him up for the next few weeks.
[01:12:48.121 --> 01:12:49.581]  He's created books and films.
[01:12:49.661 --> 01:12:53.903]  One of them we made, Strategic Relocation, the film, and the book, it's in the Fuller Store.
[01:12:53.943 --> 01:12:57.064]  But, I mean, there are areas that the missiles don't target.
[01:12:57.404 --> 01:12:59.505]  There are areas that block you with mountains from fallout.
[01:13:00.284 --> 01:13:02.845]  the inner mountain west, other areas.
[01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:08.304]   And who cares if you live in a small little cabin and work at the gas station and save money
[01:13:08.304 --> 01:13:09.864]  and have a little garden?
[01:13:09.864 --> 01:13:12.724]  It isn't about standard of living, it's about living.
[01:13:12.724 --> 01:13:16.323]  It's not about being a fancy pants, it's about surviving.
[01:13:16.323 --> 01:13:21.564]   And so, you know, my bug out plan, you know, bankruptcy's proven it all,
[01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:26.123]   and all the stuff they claimed I did, the numbers have gone from 100 million to 50 million
[01:13:26.123 --> 01:13:28.123]  to 10 million to 5 million to a million.
[01:13:28.123 --> 01:13:30.323]   Now they're like, oh my God, Jones doesn't have any money, he spent it all.
[01:13:30.323 --> 01:13:32.484]  I did what I said I'd do.
[01:13:32.484 --> 01:13:35.524]  That's come out, now the press is kind of quiet on that.
[01:13:35.524 --> 01:13:38.805]   But literally, I've got family that's got an extra cabin for me.
[01:13:39.227 --> 01:14:12.332]   In the middle of the woods and we've got solar and a well and you know a big propane tank that'll last a year and that's my bug out plan and it's not the best place in the United States but that's what I can do so it's better than nothing and you know I've got friends That are pilots, that are patriots, five or six of them, and they got helicopters, and they promised me that if I need to be, when the roads are shut down, if I need to be evacuated to a rural area, I'm ready to do it, so.
[01:14:13.388 --> 01:14:14.389]  That's what it comes down to.
[01:14:14.409 --> 01:14:19.034]  I've got several backup plans, and I've been forced to do that.
[01:14:19.074 --> 01:14:25.300]  I mean, until about two years ago, I spent no time on defense, everything on offense to stop these people.
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:29.504]  But things are so bad, I can't look my family in the eyes without building a backup.
[01:14:29.524 --> 01:14:31.086]  So I think your call is very legitimate, Lori.
[01:14:32.147 --> 01:14:32.567]  Thank you.
[01:14:32.908 --> 01:14:34.970]  Well, you know, keep doing what you're doing.
[01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.871]  We appreciate it.
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:44.185]  You know, supplements and all, it's all, you know, for the greatest cause, which is the maintenance of human civilization.
[01:14:44.625 --> 01:14:45.146]  Absolutely.
[01:14:45.166 --> 01:14:45.946]  I appreciate your call.
[01:14:46.427 --> 01:14:46.707]  Yeah.
[01:14:46.787 --> 01:14:51.830]  I mean, I have family that has old family property with old ranch houses and stuff that are half fallen down.
[01:14:52.671 --> 01:15:02.357]  And so we've got a little cabin with a living room and a kitchen and then two split little rooms with just basically you walk in, there's a bed.
[01:15:03.098 --> 01:15:06.160]  There's like room for one table and a lamp and that's it.
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:11.768]  And there's solar, and there's propane, and there's a well.
[01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:21.583]  And I can charge with the solar electric bike, and we got a tractor, we got a four-wheel drive, and we got guns.
[01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:33.559]  And that's when the lights go off, they turn everything off, we go into civil war, I'm not going to be running around the leader of the resistance, because in this thing it'll all just be brainwashed people who are fighting, they don't even know what they're part of.
[01:15:33.979 --> 01:15:43.343]  I'll be like Obi-Wan Kenobi, I'm going to go hide out on Tantoween, and you know, wait for the next big revolution, because this thing is information warfare.
[01:15:43.883 --> 01:15:48.685]  And if we don't fix this with the truth now, once it all unravels, you just got to keep your head down.
[01:15:49.643 --> 01:15:54.166]  Uh, because stacking up dead cops, which is so easy to do, uh, does not fix things.
[01:15:54.366 --> 01:15:55.726]  In fact, it's the opposite of what we want to do.
[01:15:55.746 --> 01:15:59.548]  Uh, if the cops are dumb enough to serve the system, that's, that's their problem.
[01:16:00.209 --> 01:16:02.070]  They try to come get us and take us to a FEMA camp.
[01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:06.952]  Well, then, you know, they got between themselves and destruction, but they're not our enemies.
[01:16:07.273 --> 01:16:08.413]  And I think the cops know this.
[01:16:08.433 --> 01:16:09.554]  They're off trying to get ready too.
[01:16:09.634 --> 01:16:16.958]  So we just got to keep our heads down and just, uh, when it comes to getting prepared, but keep our heads up when it comes to stopping this.
[01:16:17.699 --> 01:16:20.982]  So, 80% offense, 20% defense is my model.
[01:16:21.602 --> 01:16:25.666]  But for somebody that doesn't have resources, you've got a need to take care of your family?
[01:16:26.126 --> 01:16:28.668]  Do 80% defense, 20% offense.
[01:16:29.349 --> 01:16:31.851]  Go speak at city council, county commission, school boards.
[01:16:32.252 --> 01:16:32.912]  Get involved.
[01:16:32.952 --> 01:16:34.473]  Call and talk radio like you just did.
[01:16:35.214 --> 01:16:36.455]  Hey Alex, you're one hard man to get up to.
[01:16:36.275 --> 01:16:40.355]   percent of your time educating your family because when this all goes down
[01:16:40.355 --> 01:16:43.755]   which it's already going down they'll then respect you and you'll be a leader
[01:16:43.755 --> 01:16:52.114]   so it's all in for Dustin in North Carolina you're on the air hey Alex
[01:16:52.114 --> 01:16:57.355]   you're one hard man to get up to can you hear me yes sir good to talk to you yes
[01:16:57.673 --> 01:17:00.356]  I just wanted to... I got a few points I just want to hit on.
[01:17:00.496 --> 01:17:01.817]  I'll be as quick as I possibly can.
[01:17:01.837 --> 01:17:05.520]  I want to thank you for bringing forth, because I was on drugs for so many years.
[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.421]  I got nailed down and prayed to God.
[01:17:07.481 --> 01:17:10.023]  I did what I could, and that stuff got me sober.
[01:17:10.183 --> 01:17:12.926]  I've been sober five years now.
[01:17:13.606 --> 01:17:19.231]  But one of the other topics I wanted to hit on is how we can come together as a community.
[01:17:20.118 --> 01:17:22.519]  Uh, TikTok, believe it or not, is actually pretty good.
[01:17:22.559 --> 01:17:24.140]  I've seen a lot of people wake up.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:31.942]  Yes, there's a controversy about it, and I see how the government's trying to take that away, but in all reality, I've seen a lot of people wake up on that.
[01:17:33.283 --> 01:17:37.064]  And I think the best way to spread a message is just be as honest and truthful as you can.
[01:17:37.084 --> 01:17:41.786]  Well, brother, I didn't do 10 minutes yesterday bragging that when I go out, all I get is love.
[01:17:41.826 --> 01:17:43.246]  That's a good message to people.
[01:17:43.686 --> 01:17:46.187]  I mean, people, what you just said, what you're seeing is true.
[01:17:46.567 --> 01:17:47.968]  People are waking up.
[01:17:50.254 --> 01:17:52.796]  Yeah, I just want to be, you can't just stay on the news.
[01:17:52.816 --> 01:17:54.097]  You gotta have some positivity.
[01:17:54.117 --> 01:17:57.260]  That's how you can manifest your, uh, the goodness in the world.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.323]  Um, also, I'm a, I'm a, I used to be a maintenance away for the railroad.
[01:18:01.383 --> 01:18:15.494]  I can tell you a lot of that stuff, the reason why trains are derailing is because the companies, the big class one railroads, they take the money from the government and they invest so little into the actual employees of the railroad.
[01:18:15.514 --> 01:18:16.735]  They admit the U.S.
[01:18:16.755 --> 01:18:18.556]  has the worst rail infrastructure in the world.
[01:18:18.596 --> 01:18:19.397]  Why do you think they did that?
[01:18:21.318 --> 01:18:22.359]  Why do I think they did that?
[01:18:22.399 --> 01:18:26.601]  Well, it's one of the, it's a very, it's where everything comes from.
[01:18:27.201 --> 01:18:37.968]  You cannot transport anything without the railroad by land, other than like, Matt, I'll tell you like, okay, a lot of the phosphate, a lot of the chemicals and stuff are transported by rail.
[01:18:38.108 --> 01:18:46.993]  And if you basically start destroying the infrastructure, you can cause a mass, you know, you can cause a bad collapse on that.
[01:18:48.953 --> 01:18:50.375]  All right, brother, I appreciate your call.
[01:18:50.436 --> 01:18:51.257]  Thank you so much.
[01:18:51.698 --> 01:18:56.306]  I want to remind listeners, get off your speaker phones, because I can actually hear you if you don't, but I heard most of what you said.
[01:18:57.127 --> 01:18:57.488]  All right.
[01:18:58.429 --> 01:19:00.813]  Dave and others, your calls are coming up.

[01:19:04.065 --> 01:19:09.129]  All right, Michael Cargill, who is a great Second Amendment advocate and also an expert on the New World Order.
[01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:18.697]  We'll talk about that big Soros-controlled DA in Austin and the Army veteran, the sergeant, had a gun pointed at him at a BLM rally and shot the guy and now convicted of murder.
[01:19:18.737 --> 01:19:19.297]  That's coming up.
[01:19:19.317 --> 01:19:21.159]  But let me tell you about this before we go back to your calls.

[01:19:47.846 --> 01:19:50.547]  It's 40% off, despite the fact it's selling out soon.
[01:19:51.207 --> 01:19:52.248]  I like the DNA Force, though.
[01:19:52.268 --> 01:19:52.948]  It's almost out.
[01:19:52.968 --> 01:19:53.868]  We should take that off sale.
[01:19:54.408 --> 01:19:57.650]  And then, finally, Turbo Force!

[01:20:20.124 --> 01:20:20.845]  This is it.
[01:20:21.165 --> 01:20:22.166]  With no hangover.
[01:20:22.186 --> 01:20:24.387]  BrainForce Plus is great.
[01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:25.628]  BrainForce Ultra great.
[01:20:25.668 --> 01:20:26.489]  Two different nootropics.
[01:20:26.969 --> 01:20:27.850]  One lasts three hours.
[01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:28.891]  One lasts five hours.
[01:20:29.271 --> 01:20:30.412]  One's super fast acting.
[01:20:30.452 --> 01:20:31.413]  The other's slow acting.
[01:20:31.433 --> 01:20:32.133]  They're all different.
[01:20:32.153 --> 01:20:32.694]  They're all great.
[01:20:33.783 --> 01:20:35.784]  Brainforce Ultra is insanely special.
[01:20:36.225 --> 01:20:38.886]  I don't want to take something really strong when I've got to go to bed in three hours.
[01:20:39.547 --> 01:20:43.950]  My wife wants to go out to dinner, go to Joe Rogan's comedy show, and it's 7 o'clock at night, I want to go to bed by 11.
[01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:46.692]  I can take Brainforce Ultra.
[01:20:47.032 --> 01:20:48.673]  Hits in 15 minutes, goes away in three hours.
[01:20:49.113 --> 01:20:49.754]  This does not.
[01:20:50.274 --> 01:20:56.198]  This is when you're driving across the country, or this is when you're about to play a football game, or this is when you want to work out and lose weight.
[01:20:56.798 --> 01:20:58.540]  TurboForce, now back in stock.

[01:21:32.544 --> 01:21:36.947]  And I can't read to you, it would take too long to read all the amino acids and things that are in this.
[01:21:37.527 --> 01:21:40.630]  I mean, I've got a two-page list here in front of me.
[01:21:40.670 --> 01:21:43.832]  That's just a small smattering of what's happening there on screen.
[01:21:44.372 --> 01:21:45.813]  All right, let's go back to calls here.
[01:21:45.893 --> 01:21:48.035]  Dave in Pennsylvania, Soros vs. the West.
[01:21:48.375 --> 01:21:49.356]  Go ahead, thanks for calling.
[01:21:50.649 --> 01:21:54.570]  Hey Alex, uh, excuse the brain fog, I haven't had any X2 in about two weeks.
[01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:55.890]  So, can't wait to get back.
[01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:59.511]  Well don't worry, X2's back in three weeks, X3's back next week.
[01:22:00.711 --> 01:22:01.771]  Good, nice to hear.
[01:22:01.891 --> 01:22:09.773]  Anyways, I was calling, I don't really believe in Soros' rhetoric against China, because I think Soros is pretty high on the pecking order of the cabal.
[01:22:10.213 --> 01:22:12.754]  And the only weapon against China is the U.S.
[01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:22.912]   industrial complex, and they have not relented on destroying our borders, our military, Our population, our currency, God, pharma and livestock can go on and on and on.
[01:22:23.832 --> 01:22:26.653]  And number two, they've been... Hold on, I don't want to interrupt you.
[01:22:26.673 --> 01:22:41.912]   I'm going to give you the floor here, but you're calling in about what I heard in the first hour where Soros said in 2009 to the deputy head of the Davos Group, now deputy Prime Minister of Canada, We want to end America, end the dollar, so China runs the world.
[01:22:41.992 --> 01:22:44.913]  Now he's turned against China, because China's double-crossed him.
[01:22:45.353 --> 01:22:51.216]  You're thinking that may be even a more sophisticated double-cross, because now it's time for China to wage war against us.
[01:22:51.596 --> 01:22:53.237]  He's going to pretend like he's on our side.
[01:22:53.257 --> 01:22:53.917]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:22:55.238 --> 01:22:58.980]  Absolutely, because their only weapon against China is the U.S.
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:02.441]  industrial complex, and they're destroying that to this day.
[01:23:02.982 --> 01:23:13.580]   We built China, starting with Nixon, who opened up the door in the early 1970s, and Reagan really Pushed all of our manufacturing, all of our medicine, everything over there.
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:14.221]  Well, you're right.
[01:23:14.321 --> 01:23:17.805]  I mean, Nixon was good in ways, and Reagan was good in ways, but they're the ones that started it.
[01:23:18.125 --> 01:23:19.827]  But Herbert Walker Bush really finished it.
[01:23:21.509 --> 01:23:22.190]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:23:22.490 --> 01:23:26.635]  But anyways, if Soros, he's pretty high in the pecking orders, like I said.
[01:23:27.096 --> 01:23:33.022]   If he was really against Easy Ping now, What would be the weapon against China?
[01:23:33.723 --> 01:23:37.084]  That would have been Trump.
[01:23:37.444 --> 01:23:40.166]  So he says he's against China, but in action he's not.
[01:23:40.186 --> 01:23:42.166]  That's a really astute point.
[01:23:46.115 --> 01:23:48.617]  You know, of course I have my doubts about Trump, too.
[01:23:48.657 --> 01:23:51.040]  Do I really believe he could have closed the southern border?
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:51.920]  Absolutely.
[01:23:51.941 --> 01:23:56.785]  Do I believe he was so stupid not to conduct warp speed?
[01:23:56.945 --> 01:23:57.446]  Absolutely.
[01:23:57.706 --> 01:24:00.869]  Or do I believe that Putin wouldn't have invaded Ukraine because he's stupid?
[01:24:01.249 --> 01:24:04.531]  I'm sick of hearing how these role leaders are being accused of being stupid.
[01:24:04.811 --> 01:24:06.752]  I think they're all following the same script.
[01:24:06.772 --> 01:24:07.772]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:24:07.792 --> 01:24:09.673]  Because you're live and you're unfiltered.
[01:24:09.733 --> 01:24:13.555]  What do you really, because I'm on the fence about Trump, even though I know he's better than the other candidates.
[01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:16.556]  So I feel bad not supporting him, but I also feel bad supporting him.
[01:24:16.916 --> 01:24:17.897]  Tell me what you think of Trump.
[01:24:20.098 --> 01:24:23.800]  Well, I work in the healthcare field, let me tell you.
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:28.882]  When he come up with warp speed, warp speed really got the snowball rolling.
[01:24:29.215 --> 01:24:32.895]  for government tyranny and we're still living through it.
[01:24:32.895 --> 01:24:37.295]   And I think he could have secured the southern border, which is a big problem now as well
[01:24:37.295 --> 01:24:38.295]  as Blue Sea.
[01:24:38.295 --> 01:24:39.295]  No, I, we did it partially.
[01:24:39.295 --> 01:24:41.134]  So I agree with you that he's got big problems.
[01:24:41.134 --> 01:24:42.134]  What do we do then?
[01:24:42.134 --> 01:24:43.134]  Who do we support?
[01:24:43.134 --> 01:24:50.975]  I personally like John F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:24:50.975 --> 01:24:54.654]   I think he's a good man who means well, but he's pro-abortion, pro-gun control.
[01:24:54.654 --> 01:24:57.094]  Yeah, that's a problem.
[01:24:57.057 --> 01:25:00.898]  All these people... And do you really think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:25:00.918 --> 01:25:01.719]  can beat these people?
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:05.280]  No, I don't.
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.541]  Trump has too big of a podium.
[01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:10.542]  I don't think Trump... I'm going to ask you again, because I'm not in your face.
[01:25:11.383 --> 01:25:12.463]  I respect you, Dave.
[01:25:12.984 --> 01:25:13.724]  I'm asking you.
[01:25:13.984 --> 01:25:16.105]  I don't... I'm normally a very decisive person.
[01:25:17.574 --> 01:25:20.115]  My gut tells me to go with Trump because they hate him so much.
[01:25:20.575 --> 01:25:21.876]  I've been persecuted for supporting him.
[01:25:21.896 --> 01:25:22.696]  I know he's got problems.
[01:25:23.076 --> 01:25:23.877]  Let me ask you this way.
[01:25:24.237 --> 01:25:25.797]  Why do you think the establishment hates him?
[01:25:25.997 --> 01:25:27.078]  Because they definitely hate him.
[01:25:27.138 --> 01:25:28.238]  It's not a fake hate.
[01:25:30.419 --> 01:25:32.620]  I think it's the same reason why they start those.
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:33.921]  It's polarization.
[01:25:33.961 --> 01:25:37.602]  They want polarization in the population and Trump is there to do it.
[01:25:38.122 --> 01:25:38.602]  I agree.
[01:25:38.923 --> 01:25:42.264]  So what do we do then?
[01:25:42.284 --> 01:25:43.384]  I want you to tell me, David.
[01:25:43.404 --> 01:25:44.265]  I'm going to put you on the spot.
[01:25:44.305 --> 01:25:44.945]  I respect you.
[01:25:46.218 --> 01:25:47.098]  What do I do, Dave?
[01:25:47.118 --> 01:25:50.399]  Because I actually, I'm going to be honest with the audience, I don't know what to do.
[01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:54.301]  Well, right now, Alex, we're stuck with Trump.
[01:25:54.521 --> 01:25:57.462]  I haven't seen anybody come out of the woodwork yet to run for President of the United States.
[01:25:57.562 --> 01:25:58.282]  Bingo!
[01:26:00.163 --> 01:26:00.703]  Bingo!
[01:26:00.803 --> 01:26:02.123]  You just said it, exactly.
[01:26:03.064 --> 01:26:05.784]  But I'm just sick of settling for the lesser of two evils.
[01:26:05.824 --> 01:26:06.445]  I am too!
[01:26:06.645 --> 01:26:07.145]  I am a hunter.
[01:26:07.545 --> 01:26:08.585]  I love Tulsi Gabbards.
[01:26:08.745 --> 01:26:10.046]  She's come a long way, but still.
[01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:14.434]  Yeah, I love those together, absolutely.
[01:26:14.915 --> 01:26:20.398]  I'm a Catholic, and as far as John Paul II, you know, I have one problem with him too.
[01:26:21.058 --> 01:26:27.041]  He did not stand up for the children who are being raped in the Catholic Diocese.
[01:26:27.101 --> 01:26:28.822]  No, I hear you.
[01:26:28.882 --> 01:26:29.443]  Talk about that.
[01:26:29.483 --> 01:26:34.285]  I'm not censoring you, but I was saying, look how good he was compared to what you got now.
[01:26:35.186 --> 01:26:37.587]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:37.667 --> 01:26:38.528]  And we get back to that.
[01:26:38.608 --> 01:26:48.220]   We say we're not for lesser of evils, but I mean, It just appears that all the world leaders and all the CEOs of all the corporations are all on the same team.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:48.921]  Exactly.
[01:26:48.981 --> 01:26:50.662]  The devil is given full control.
[01:26:50.722 --> 01:26:51.562]  I think that's what we're saying.
[01:26:51.903 --> 01:26:53.764]  And I question if Trump's on that team or not.
[01:26:53.804 --> 01:26:55.505]  He has proven to me that he's not on that team.
[01:26:57.146 --> 01:26:57.586]  I agree.
[01:26:57.847 --> 01:27:02.790]  I'm not sure Trump is on our team, but their hatred of him is very real.
[01:27:03.150 --> 01:27:04.271]  But is that just one level?
[01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:10.682]  I think the hatred could be just a polarization of a script we're watching, just like on TV.
[01:27:10.702 --> 01:27:11.203]  I agree.
[01:27:11.263 --> 01:27:13.984]  So I'm going to ask you again, and I'm not saying this like I have the answer.
[01:27:14.424 --> 01:27:15.445]  What do we do, Dave?
[01:27:17.546 --> 01:27:21.588]  We need to find a leader that is pro-marijuana.
[01:27:21.809 --> 01:27:24.470]  I mean, hey, Alex, do you believe they could flip this script tomorrow?
[01:27:24.670 --> 01:27:27.672]  They could take education, media, all the corporations.
[01:27:27.712 --> 01:27:28.912]  They could flip the script tomorrow.
[01:27:28.972 --> 01:27:32.615]  Pro-family, pro-father, pro-America, shut the borders down, war against drugs.
[01:27:32.895 --> 01:27:35.176]  They could do it in the blink of an eye.
[01:27:35.976 --> 01:27:37.877]  They could fix these problems overnight.
[01:27:37.917 --> 01:27:39.078]  They're helping Greece's kids.
[01:27:40.218 --> 01:27:40.839]  Absolutely.
[01:27:41.279 --> 01:27:41.819]  Absolutely.
[01:27:41.859 --> 01:27:44.181]  They could steal the border in a day.
[01:27:44.581 --> 01:27:45.421]  Dave, great points.
[01:27:45.882 --> 01:27:46.762]  Let's jam in one more.
[01:27:46.782 --> 01:27:47.763]  I'll give you a minute and a half.
[01:27:48.243 --> 01:27:49.524]  Let's go to Brian in California.
[01:27:49.564 --> 01:27:49.904]  Go ahead.
[01:27:50.804 --> 01:27:51.525]  Hello, Alex.
[01:27:51.545 --> 01:27:52.485]  You're asking what to do.
[01:27:52.525 --> 01:27:59.769]  The first thing you have to know is that the Vatican is backing BLM and Antifa to burn down American cities when Trump was in office.
[01:27:59.849 --> 01:28:04.372]  That's who took out Trump from Rome and London to Washington, D.C.
[01:28:04.392 --> 01:28:04.752]  and New York.
[01:28:05.106 --> 01:28:12.992]  The Vatican created Antifa back in the 1700s to take out the kings of Europe, both Protestant and Catholic.
[01:28:13.792 --> 01:28:15.193]  They set up this New World Order.
[01:28:15.493 --> 01:28:18.355]  They run Washington, D.C., and they set up D.C.
[01:28:18.375 --> 01:28:24.760]  That's why they moved the capital from Philadelphia to District of Columbia in Maryland, where Georgetown University was.
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:26.580]  And that's who's behind it.
[01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:27.781]  That's who did 9-11.
[01:28:28.241 --> 01:28:35.423]  George Tenet has a special diplomacy degree from Georgetown University.
[01:28:35.463 --> 01:28:37.464]  He was the CIA director on 9-11.
[01:28:37.764 --> 01:28:39.184]  They blew up the World Trade Center.
[01:28:39.404 --> 01:28:40.525]  They blew up the Pentagon.
[01:28:40.805 --> 01:28:43.366]  They launched the COVID-19 terror attack.
[01:28:43.406 --> 01:28:44.626]  They took out President Trump.
[01:28:45.006 --> 01:28:46.066]  They run Antifa.
[01:28:46.086 --> 01:28:49.087]  They run the unions here in the United States to rig elections.
[01:28:49.408 --> 01:28:50.608]  They took out Bolsonaro.
[01:28:51.283 --> 01:28:52.724]  And they run Europe into the ground.
[01:28:52.944 --> 01:28:53.784]  That's what's happening.
[01:28:53.844 --> 01:29:01.948]  If you want to do something about the New World Order, you have to realize that the ADL and all these Jewish mafia are absolutely working with the Vatican.
[01:29:02.168 --> 01:29:06.351]  They're taking their directions from the Vatican, Deva's group, all of it.
[01:29:06.871 --> 01:29:07.731]  That's who's behind it.
[01:29:08.051 --> 01:29:09.772]  All right, appreciate your call.
[01:29:10.653 --> 01:29:12.674]  Mike in Houston and others are straight ahead.
[01:29:12.734 --> 01:29:15.515]  And Mike Cargill, a man on fire.
[01:29:15.395 --> 01:29:20.795]   We'll talk about the big case in Texas where the veteran convicted of murder for defending himself.
[01:29:20.795 --> 01:29:38.914]   I intend to take the InfoWars armored truck out, or the InfoWars tank as it's so lovingly called,
[01:29:38.850 --> 01:29:43.450]   You came through yesterday and shopped at Infowarsstore.com, so I'm gonna be able to take the truck out
[01:29:43.450 --> 01:29:45.450]  [Music]
[01:29:45.450 --> 01:29:47.449]  [Music]
[01:29:47.449 --> 01:29:49.449]  [Music]
[01:29:49.449 --> 01:29:52.029]  (upbeat music)
[01:29:52.029 --> 01:29:54.609]  (upbeat music)
[01:29:54.609 --> 01:29:57.189]  (upbeat music)
[01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:59.770]  (upbeat music)
[01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:04.829]  (upbeat music)
[01:30:04.829 --> 01:30:11.050]  (upbeat music)
[01:30:11.050 --> 01:30:16.829]  (upbeat music)
[01:30:16.829 --> 01:30:23.090]  (upbeat music)
[01:30:26.190 --> 01:30:28.770]  (upbeat music)
[01:30:28.770 --> 01:30:32.650]  (upbeat music)
[01:30:32.650 --> 01:30:42.410]   All three of the Abrahamic religions teach that lending to the poor is an act of compassion
[01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:44.810]  that serves the entire community.
[01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:48.890]  And therefore, charging interest was seen as immoral.
[01:30:49.079 --> 01:30:52.922]  It was called usury and was considered a heinous crime.
[01:30:53.863 --> 01:31:02.126]  The Roman Empire allowed usury, but in 1179, the Catholic Church decreed that usury was forbidden.
[01:31:02.746 --> 01:31:04.726]  This law did not apply to Jews.
[01:31:05.167 --> 01:31:16.230]  While the Torah admonishes usury, Talmudic law allows a Jew to practice usury with a non-Jew, and so money lending became primarily a Jewish business.
[01:31:17.632 --> 01:31:28.512]  Over the years, usury became more accepted in Western society, and we've changed the definition with the addendum of charging interest at an excessive rate.
[01:31:29.714 --> 01:31:34.960]  In the 17th century, the Bank of England began issuing paper fiat money.
[01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:39.925]  This gave the banks the ability to simply print money out of thin air.
[01:31:40.426 --> 01:31:49.876]  And for over a century, this was rightfully called out as fraud, until it became public policy, known now as fractional reserve banking.
[01:31:50.899 --> 01:31:55.442]  What was once seen as immoral is now seen as normal.
[01:31:56.242 --> 01:32:03.066]  Many assume that the financial loans given out by the banks are coming from savings they hold for their depositors.
[01:32:03.606 --> 01:32:04.706]  But this is not true.
[01:32:05.187 --> 01:32:13.151]  When someone takes out a loan, the bank creates new money out of thin air and then charges the person interest to borrow it.
[01:32:13.851 --> 01:32:20.115]  Fractional reserve banking allows the banks to legally create 10 times the amount of each deposit.
[01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:30.221]  This inflating of the circulating currency devalues that currency and allows the banks an opportunity to profit dramatically.
[01:32:30.241 --> 01:32:42.488]  The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 began a system of debt designed to inflate beyond its means until it implodes, the exact opposite of sound money.
[01:32:43.368 --> 01:33:04.689]  The banking cartel funded both sides of World War I, which led to the Great Depression, which led to the Emergency Banking Act of 1933, which ended the gold standard and made every dollar spent an IOU to further increase the debt, which is ultimately owed by the American people.
[01:33:05.615 --> 01:33:19.988]  The banking cartel funded both sides of World War II, which led to the Bretton Woods monetary system, which made the USD the world reserve currency, and gave central banks the option to go straight to the gold window of the U.S.
[01:33:20.048 --> 01:33:22.310]  Treasury to exchange U.S.
[01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:23.932]  dollars for physical gold.
[01:33:24.673 --> 01:33:28.979]  But by endlessly creating more debt, it became clear that the U.S.
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:32.344]  had printed far beyond their gold reserves.
[01:33:32.945 --> 01:33:39.936]  And when several nations came to collect their gold, the federal government dishonorably closed the gold window.
[01:33:41.224 --> 01:33:44.907]  To maintain world reserve currency status, the U.S.
[01:33:45.047 --> 01:33:46.629]  turned to its military.
[01:33:47.249 --> 01:33:51.172]  Guns for hire to Saudi Arabia in return for the petrodollar.
[01:33:51.653 --> 01:33:55.656]  And war with any nation who threatens USD dominance.
[01:33:56.637 --> 01:34:03.943]  A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors.
[01:34:04.603 --> 01:34:06.325]  And that's what the bankers created.
[01:34:06.345 --> 01:34:09.828]  They profit exponentially off the people's debt.
[01:34:10.468 --> 01:34:13.930]  It was designed to collapse, and that's what it's doing now.
[01:34:14.471 --> 01:34:24.397]  All the markets are crashing, and the derivatives market alone is in the quadrillions, which is much more than the total financial assets of the entire world.
[01:34:24.837 --> 01:34:27.378]  There is nothing left to prop up the dollar.
[01:34:27.899 --> 01:34:30.120]  This Ponzi scheme is at its end.
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:34.763]  What that means is that the money you have in the banks will disappear.
[01:34:35.567 --> 01:34:38.732]  Everything will go to zero and then we reset.
[01:34:39.393 --> 01:34:42.198]  How we do that will ultimately be up to the people.
[01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:52.020]  The banking cartel knows that the only way they can survive this collapse is to somehow convert everyone to an authoritarian CBDC.
[01:34:52.821 --> 01:34:56.544]  But without the people's trust, the banks will have problems with this.
[01:34:57.245 --> 01:35:02.751]  Many people will lose everything and will want nothing but justice from the old banking system.
[01:35:03.211 --> 01:35:05.133]  But many others will comply.
[01:35:06.235 --> 01:35:16.950]  Hard times are coming fast, and if we were smart, we'd prepare, let the big banks die, and create a banking system that serves we the people.
[01:35:17.671 --> 01:35:36.070]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:39.001]  He's got a whole bunch of lawsuits out against the federal government.
[01:35:39.021 --> 01:35:41.902]  He's won national cases at appellate courts.
[01:35:41.942 --> 01:35:44.043]  One of the cases is going to the Supreme Court.
[01:35:44.523 --> 01:35:45.903]  We're going to be talking about that.
[01:35:45.984 --> 01:35:46.644]  Bump stocks.
[01:35:47.624 --> 01:35:51.106]  There are attacks on stocks, on guns, you name it.
[01:35:51.186 --> 01:35:57.328]  But he's also got his ear to the ground with law enforcement here in Austin with this DA that is completely Soros-run.
[01:35:57.968 --> 01:36:03.371]  So find all of his work at centraltexasgunworks.com and michaelcardgill.com.
[01:36:03.391 --> 01:36:09.113]  But let's start here with the big case that was the top story starting Friday and still one of the top stories.
[01:36:09.733 --> 01:36:20.643]   You have an Army Sergeant, veteran of Afghanistan, no criminal record, surrounded by BLM, mainly a bunch of white people, and they point a gun at him.
[01:36:20.683 --> 01:36:21.424]  We have the photo.
[01:36:21.444 --> 01:36:21.984]  We'll show it.
[01:36:22.986 --> 01:36:27.632]  And he feels in fear of his life with a semi-automatic AK pointed at him.
[01:36:27.992 --> 01:36:28.653]  He shoots him.
[01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:39.272]  And now he's been convicted, even though the police said no, it was justified, that they would have shot him and they warned the individual pointing his gun at people, you're about to get shot.
[01:36:39.912 --> 01:36:45.934]  So here we are, this DA, the names, the players, where this is all going.
[01:36:46.354 --> 01:36:50.175]  Michael Cargill, you're an expert on this, you live it every day, you're right in the middle of it.
[01:36:50.575 --> 01:36:51.915]  You have all the law enforcement sources.
[01:36:51.955 --> 01:36:54.276]  Let's talk about why this case is so important.
[01:36:54.844 --> 01:37:19.517]   Yeah, Alex, this case is really important because the DA, this DA here in Travis County, is saying that now all of a sudden, here we are in 2023, it is actually legal in 2023, legal for someone to wear a face mask, tactical gear, 10 o'clock at night, block traffic, bang gun vehicles, attack vehicles, with an AK-47, threaten someone, Point the gun at them and they're saying that is legal.
[01:37:19.557 --> 01:37:22.998]  All of a sudden today they want to tell you that they support the Second Amendment.
[01:37:23.018 --> 01:37:25.039]  They don't want to ban ARs or AKs anymore.
[01:37:25.399 --> 01:37:35.803]  Now all of a sudden they're supporting ARs and AKs and they think it's okay to attack vehicles, block vehicles, bang on vehicles with an AK and threaten citizens on a major road in this country.
[01:37:37.759 --> 01:37:51.317]  I mean, I have to be honest, if I was blocked in and we've seen the footage out of his car, he slowed down, he stopped, they surround him, shots are going off, a guy lifts a gun and aims it at you, you'd be crazy to not be tried by nine instead of carried by six.
[01:37:51.357 --> 01:37:51.698]  That's right.
[01:37:52.599 --> 01:37:56.199]   couple of different things here in Texas that follow the Texas Penal Code. One of
[01:37:56.199 --> 01:37:59.199]   them is going to be the stand your ground law and one that is going to be
[01:37:59.199 --> 01:38:02.918]   the castle doctrine. Castle doctrine says that if someone enters you know
[01:38:02.918 --> 01:38:07.559]   attempts to enter enters my home, my vehicle, my place of business I can use
[01:38:07.559 --> 01:38:11.318]   force of daily force to stop them. There's the stand your ground law that
[01:38:11.318 --> 01:38:14.637]   says that anywhere I have a right to be as long as I'm not committing a crime
[01:38:14.637 --> 01:38:19.318]   something greater than a class C misdemeanor as long as I'm not provoking
[01:38:19.318 --> 01:38:22.719]   someone I can stand my ground defend myself if someone's trying to commit
[01:38:22.719 --> 01:38:26.599]   aggravated kidnapping, murder, sexual assault, aggravated sex assault, robbery,
[01:38:26.599 --> 01:38:29.278]  aggravated robbery.
[01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:32.130]  I'm not trying to put you on the spot, but you train me from I Can Still Carry.
[01:38:32.150 --> 01:38:34.311]  You're one of the biggest trainers in Central Texas.
[01:38:34.691 --> 01:38:37.232]  Very respected by law enforcement, the media, you're all over the news.
[01:38:37.992 --> 01:38:39.252]  What would you have done?
[01:38:39.272 --> 01:38:41.493]  I probably wouldn't have gone to work that night.
[01:38:41.773 --> 01:38:42.633]  Obviously, you needed money.
[01:38:43.033 --> 01:38:45.794]  But there's riots and burning cars and taking over highways.
[01:38:46.134 --> 01:38:57.166]   I'm not blaming Daniel Perry, who's been convicted now, but I'm saying, what would you do if people blocked your car and a man walked over and went, You roll down your window, he thought of it, and they shove
[01:38:57.166 --> 01:38:58.386]  an AK-47 in your face.
[01:38:58.386 --> 01:39:00.787]  Man, I would have to stop them. I'm telling you right now.
[01:39:00.787 --> 01:39:05.346]   First, I wouldn't put myself in that situation, trying not to be where protesters are.
[01:39:05.346 --> 01:39:11.186]   But then once you're in that situation, you have an AK-47, someone banging on your window,
[01:39:11.186 --> 01:39:15.025]   banging on your car, kicking your vehicle, telling you to get out of the car,
[01:39:15.025 --> 01:39:17.746]  then, you know, I have to stop this person.
[01:39:17.746 --> 01:39:19.426]  Because that's a carjacking, right?
[01:39:19.426 --> 01:39:23.506]   To me, they're trying to, exactly, trying to carjack me, or even worse, trying to kill me.
[01:39:23.506 --> 01:39:25.426]  So I have to stop you.
[01:39:25.426 --> 01:39:28.466]   You know, I don't understand, you know, what this DA is trying to do,
[01:39:28.466 --> 01:39:31.186]  but I'm very happy that the governor is standing up.
[01:39:31.292 --> 01:39:36.897]  Governor Abbott is saying, you know what, this is a farce, this is a Soros-backed DA.
[01:39:36.918 --> 01:39:43.403]  Yeah, I'm not attacking, I love Tucker Carlson, and I'm glad he put pressure, but he kind of said the governor's doing nothing Friday night.
[01:39:43.704 --> 01:39:44.945]  The governor didn't have time to respond.
[01:39:45.205 --> 01:39:46.165]  But he did by Saturday.
[01:39:46.445 --> 01:39:46.726]  He did.
[01:39:46.746 --> 01:39:47.486]  That's right.
[01:39:47.526 --> 01:39:48.886]  Talk about what the governor said.
[01:39:49.106 --> 01:39:54.128]  This case happened, you know, you're talking the verdict came down at like five o'clock, you know, on a Friday.
[01:39:54.308 --> 01:39:57.629]  The governor didn't have a chance to respond to anyone with that.
[01:39:57.789 --> 01:40:01.130]  Everyone was trying to digest this information and get all this information.
[01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:09.833]  But then once the governor was able to, you know, get all the info, then he said, you know, he's looking to pardon this person as soon as they board a pardon can get the paperwork to his desk.
[01:40:10.293 --> 01:40:11.334]  Then he's going to pardon him.
[01:40:11.475 --> 01:40:12.936]  It's humanly possible.
[01:40:13.357 --> 01:40:15.299]  But we have a process in Texas.
[01:40:15.379 --> 01:40:16.901]  It's just not, it's not like the president.
[01:40:17.161 --> 01:40:20.926]  The president can pardon anyone at any moment in time while they're president.
[01:40:20.946 --> 01:40:27.093]  But the governor of Texas, it has to be sent to him from the Board of Pardons and then he can sign that paperwork.
[01:40:28.154 --> 01:40:31.437]  Just as a citizen, as an army veteran, what is your view of this?
[01:40:32.057 --> 01:40:37.602]  You know, in a situation like this, you have to help your attorneys out also.
[01:40:38.122 --> 01:40:40.985]  You're in a situation where you have to use your gun for self-defense.
[01:40:41.425 --> 01:40:43.527]  My advice to you is dial 9-1-1.
[01:40:44.167 --> 01:40:45.549]  Keep your statements very short.
[01:40:45.809 --> 01:40:46.990]  My name is so-and-so, so-and-so.
[01:40:47.010 --> 01:40:48.391]  My address is so-and-so, so-and-so.
[01:40:48.871 --> 01:40:49.812]  There's been an incident.
[01:40:49.932 --> 01:40:51.734]  I need paramedics, police, whatever you need.
[01:40:52.474 --> 01:40:53.755]  Give them your location.
[01:40:54.016 --> 01:40:55.377]  And then, boom, hang that phone up.
[01:40:55.797 --> 01:40:56.798]  Contact your attorney.
[01:40:56.838 --> 01:40:58.339]  Let your attorney do the talking for you.
[01:40:58.559 --> 01:40:59.820]  You have a right to remain silent.
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:02.722]  Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
[01:41:03.202 --> 01:41:09.166]  Do not put yourself in a situation where you're sitting down in a room giving statements to police without your attorney present.
[01:41:09.486 --> 01:41:11.968]  Because even if they don't use it against you, the DA is.
[01:41:12.148 --> 01:41:12.528]  That's right.
[01:41:12.628 --> 01:41:14.550]  You have to have your attorney present.
[01:41:15.410 --> 01:41:17.051]  Let your attorney do the talking for you.
[01:41:17.071 --> 01:41:20.594]  And it's not that you have something to hide, but people are out to get you.
[01:41:21.434 --> 01:41:21.594]  Right.
[01:41:21.775 --> 01:41:26.459]  In that moment in time, you just shot someone, you killed someone, watched them die or found out that they died.
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:33.546]  You don't want to give a statement to the police because you're not in the right mindset to explain all that information, explain your actions and what you're doing.
[01:41:33.566 --> 01:41:35.608]  Well, we'll grab the video because I didn't tell the crew to do it.
[01:41:35.688 --> 01:41:41.995]  Like three weeks ago, or a month ago, the cars all blocked South Lamar, drive around crazy, shoot guns in the air, throw fireworks at cops.
[01:41:42.295 --> 01:41:44.895]  Two weeks before that, downtown, they chased the cops out.
[01:41:44.895 --> 01:41:47.295]   They're shooting guns in the air, throwing fireworks at them.
[01:41:47.295 --> 01:41:51.194]   My 20-year-old, 19-year-old daughter was driving back home to her apartment.
[01:41:51.194 --> 01:41:52.795]  She got blocked. She got scared.
[01:41:52.795 --> 01:41:55.694]  I mean, this isn't like we're just picking a few cases.
[01:41:55.694 --> 01:41:56.994]  This town's become lawless.
[01:41:56.994 --> 01:42:01.694]   Yes, and I'm happy that the state police have actually stepped in.
[01:42:01.831 --> 01:42:08.756]  The governor said, you know what, we're sending the state police, you know, to Austin to patrol Austin because this is where the Capitol is located, the capital of Texas.
[01:42:09.136 --> 01:42:12.379]  Texas is almost, you know, one of the largest states in the United States.
[01:42:12.739 --> 01:42:19.764]  And we cannot have this city fall to just complete lawlessness and just attacking innocent citizens like they're trying to do right now.
[01:42:20.125 --> 01:42:21.265]  And you've got your ear to the ground.
[01:42:21.365 --> 01:42:23.647]  You've been warning for like four years things are getting out of control.
[01:42:24.047 --> 01:42:24.968]  How bad is it now?
[01:42:25.188 --> 01:42:26.109]  I mean, you talk about it.
[01:42:26.469 --> 01:42:27.149]  It's real bad.
[01:42:27.169 --> 01:42:30.451]  There's a possibility we could have a serial killer here in Austin as well.
[01:42:31.011 --> 01:42:34.812]  Someone that's actually attacking young males who are 20 to 30 years old.
[01:42:35.393 --> 01:42:40.575]  They're saying that they're getting drunk and they're wandering off and getting into the lake and drowning.
[01:42:40.915 --> 01:42:54.320]  With odds like that, that many males who are 20 to 30 years old in that time frame that are just drowning in the lake after a night of having a good time with a bunch of friends, I need to take those odds to Vegas and bet on them.
[01:42:54.540 --> 01:42:55.461]  This place is getting crazy.
[01:42:55.741 --> 01:42:56.703]  It's getting insane.
[01:42:56.743 --> 01:42:58.004]  So we have a serious problem.
[01:42:58.264 --> 01:43:06.494]  So we need the state police to come in and to assist the local police department because we are 300 police officers short in Austin.
[01:43:06.654 --> 01:43:09.057]  This is complete chaos right now.
[01:43:10.336 --> 01:43:11.837]  You don't tell me crimes exploded.
[01:43:12.177 --> 01:43:12.798]  Yes, it has.
[01:43:13.258 --> 01:43:15.019]  And so, you know, we're going to need things like this.
[01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:20.603]  This DA is just, he is not prosecuting the people that he needs to prosecute.
[01:43:20.803 --> 01:43:24.405]  You have someone that actually fired a shot at Daniel Perry's vehicle.
[01:43:24.806 --> 01:43:35.533]  A guy named Nico Daisy was in the crowd, one of the protesters, and you said it yourself, Alex, you know, this is a BLM Black Lives Matter protest and 99% of the people there were actually white, not black.
[01:43:36.413 --> 01:43:38.034]  So this is not a color issue at all.
[01:43:38.054 --> 01:43:41.715]  And you have a certain, you know, people are out there now.
[01:43:41.775 --> 01:43:43.856]  It's a bunch of communists hiding behind black people.
[01:43:43.956 --> 01:43:44.676]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:43:44.976 --> 01:43:46.677]  And so this guy was a medic.
[01:43:46.757 --> 01:43:51.359]  He was from out of state, came into the state to participate in the protest or riots.
[01:43:51.819 --> 01:43:55.920]  And then he actually fired several rounds at the vehicle while the vehicle was driving away.
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:01.702]  He said he wanted to shoot, you know, shoot at the vehicle so that police can identify the vehicle later on down the day.
[01:44:02.022 --> 01:44:03.483]  Not later on in the day.
[01:44:03.783 --> 01:44:10.990]  So now all of a sudden you're telling me that now you're protesting cops but now you want to act like the cop or participate and help the cops.
[01:44:12.311 --> 01:44:18.196]  When he was trying to shoot Daniel Perry, he wasn't trying to mark the car.
[01:44:18.897 --> 01:44:20.038]  Right.
[01:44:20.058 --> 01:44:28.225]  He testified on the stand that he shot at the vehicle so that the police can identify the vehicle later.
[01:44:29.326 --> 01:44:29.867]  Incredible.
[01:44:30.988 --> 01:44:31.449]  What do you think?
[01:44:31.469 --> 01:44:34.812]  Well, we're going to go to break, but they got these Soros DAs everywhere.
[01:44:34.853 --> 01:44:40.699]  Did you see the case in New York where the attendant sees the guy robbing the car and then the guy tries to shoot him and wrestles the gun away?
[01:44:40.879 --> 01:44:41.059]  No.
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:42.581]  And then he's being charged in New York.
[01:44:42.761 --> 01:44:42.942]  Wow.
[01:44:44.059 --> 01:44:44.939]  Yeah, that's New York for you.
[01:44:44.959 --> 01:44:47.841]  That's New York, that's California, that's those, you know, those states like that.
[01:44:48.741 --> 01:44:53.123]  We got to do something with, you know, with the... I'm sure you've seen all the big liberals getting killed now.
[01:44:53.363 --> 01:44:54.323]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:44:54.803 --> 01:44:55.083]  Wow.
[01:44:55.484 --> 01:44:58.665]  Michael Cargill's our host, our guest host here.
[01:44:59.425 --> 01:45:00.766]  In with us right now, co-hosting.
[01:45:00.786 --> 01:45:01.486]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:01.566 --> 01:45:02.606]  Infowars.com.
[01:45:02.907 --> 01:45:03.767]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:45:04.827 --> 01:45:06.248]  The verdict of the jury is as follows.
[01:45:06.468 --> 01:45:07.509]  The verdict of the jury.
[01:45:07.589 --> 01:45:14.373]  We, the jury, find the defendant, Daniel Perry, guilty of the offensive murder as alleged in count one of the indictments signed by the foreperson.
[01:45:15.454 --> 01:45:16.494]  Verdict form number two.
[01:45:17.035 --> 01:45:17.895]  Verdict of the jury.
[01:45:18.135 --> 01:45:25.900]  We, the jury, find the defendant, Daniel Perry, not guilty of the offensive aggravated assault with a deadly weapon as alleged in count two of the indictment.
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:26.961]  Please be seated.
[01:45:30.002 --> 01:45:30.923]  What kind of party might the jury be for?
[01:45:30.943 --> 01:45:31.943]  Jury number 6, is that your verdict?
[01:45:31.963 --> 01:45:32.143]  Yes, it is.
[01:45:32.183 --> 01:45:33.484]  Jury number 7, is that your verdict?
[01:45:33.504 --> 01:45:33.724]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:33.744 --> 01:45:34.664]  Jury number 8, is that your verdict?
[01:45:34.984 --> 01:45:35.184]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:35.204 --> 01:45:36.145]  Jury number 9, is that your verdict?
[01:45:36.165 --> 01:45:36.385]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:36.405 --> 01:45:37.405]  Jury number 10, is that your verdict?
[01:45:37.425 --> 01:45:37.945]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:37.965 --> 01:45:39.026]  Jury number 10, is that your verdict?
[01:45:39.046 --> 01:45:39.366]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:39.406 --> 01:45:40.786]  Jury number 10, is that your verdict?
[01:45:40.806 --> 01:45:41.086]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:41.106 --> 01:45:42.647]  Jury number 10, is that your verdict?
[01:45:42.667 --> 01:45:42.807]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:43.347 --> 01:45:44.107]  Jury number 10, is that your verdict?
[01:45:44.127 --> 01:45:44.267]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:44.287 --> 01:45:46.068]  Jury number 10, is that your verdict?
[01:45:46.088 --> 01:45:46.228]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:46.328 --> 01:45:48.989]  Jury number 10, is that your verdict?
[01:45:49.009 --> 01:45:49.189]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:49.249 --> 01:45:51.010]  Jury number 10, is that your verdict?
[01:45:51.190 --> 01:45:51.390]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:51.410 --> 01:45:52.290]  Jury number 10, is that your verdict?
[01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.490]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:53.531]  Jury number 10, is that your verdict?
[01:45:53.551 --> 01:45:53.751]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:54.251 --> 01:45:55.171]  Jury number 10, is that your verdict?
[01:45:55.211 --> 01:45:55.411]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:56.231 --> 01:46:06.231]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:46:06.231 --> 01:46:16.231]  [INAUDIBLE]
[01:46:16.231 --> 01:46:26.231]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:46:26.231 --> 01:46:36.231]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:46:36.231 --> 01:46:46.231]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:46:46.231 --> 01:46:56.231]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:46:47.287 --> 01:46:58.892]  So under common law and common sense, you block somebody's car, you come and knock on their window and aim a rifle at their head, looking down the barrel, you're authorized to shoot that person.
[01:46:59.472 --> 01:47:05.515]  Michael Cargill, you've won major federal court cases, you're a major gun show, gun shop owner, you're a major gun trainer.
[01:47:06.355 --> 01:47:14.027]   Looking at this, why do you think this Soros DA Jose Garza did this, and where do you see this going?
[01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:16.310]  I think he wants to prove a point.
[01:47:17.331 --> 01:47:31.062]   Anyone who supports law enforcement, anyone who opposes his political goal, He's going to prosecute those people because he's proven this time and time again.
[01:47:31.222 --> 01:47:34.083]  He's not prosecuting the ones that are the actual protesters.
[01:47:34.903 --> 01:47:36.603]  The guy that fired shots in the crowd.
[01:47:36.743 --> 01:47:38.644]  He hasn't prosecuted any of those people at all.
[01:47:38.964 --> 01:47:44.625]  And now he's come out just now and he's released a statement just moments ago saying that he's going to request.
[01:47:45.025 --> 01:47:46.205]  His statement is exactly this.
[01:47:46.305 --> 01:47:50.386]  Before making any decision, I implore you to review the trial's transcript.
[01:47:50.426 --> 01:47:53.807]  He's talking to the parole board, the pardons and parole board.
[01:47:54.387 --> 01:48:04.055]  He says he wants them to look at the evidence from the trial, officials that may have an impact on public safety and request input from the victim's family as to how a pardon may impact them.
[01:48:04.115 --> 01:48:11.421]  So he wants to try to circumvent what the governor is trying to do and jump in and have a private meeting with the pardons and the parole board.
[01:48:11.641 --> 01:48:14.384]  What people don't realize is the governor appoints these people.
[01:48:15.566 --> 01:48:20.850]  And so I don't see them actually going against what the governor's asking them to do.
[01:48:20.930 --> 01:48:23.551]  What do you think they do when the governor rightfully pardons him?
[01:48:23.591 --> 01:48:25.232]  Because somebody points a gun.
[01:48:25.333 --> 01:48:27.414]  I mean, I'm not going to do this to you, Cargill.
[01:48:28.134 --> 01:48:28.615]  I like you.
[01:48:28.655 --> 01:48:29.395]  Plus, I want to die.
[01:48:29.715 --> 01:48:33.418]  But if I just pull a gun out and point it at you, I mean, how are you supposed to put up with that?
[01:48:33.638 --> 01:48:33.798]  Right.
[01:48:33.998 --> 01:48:35.579]  You have to you have to protect yourself.
[01:48:35.639 --> 01:48:36.860]  I'm pointing a gun at you right now.
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:39.002]  There's one thing there's you can't you can't stop.
[01:48:39.042 --> 01:48:40.963]  We all know the old Westerns are based on real stories.
[01:48:41.263 --> 01:48:44.946]  When you pull the gun, that's when you're I mean, he who shoots first wins.
[01:48:45.786 --> 01:48:46.767]  That's the bottom line.
[01:48:46.928 --> 01:48:48.049]  He who shoots first wins.
[01:48:48.369 --> 01:48:50.832]  Are you gonna let this person kill you, or are you gonna stop them?
[01:48:51.613 --> 01:48:55.397]  So when you were in the army and overseas, did you learn to, like, wait till they pulled their gun?
[01:48:56.275 --> 01:48:57.756]  Well, somebody pointed a gun at you.
[01:48:57.796 --> 01:48:58.196]  What did you do?
[01:48:58.376 --> 01:48:59.276]  At that point, it's too late.
[01:49:00.616 --> 01:49:01.677]  It takes a matter of seconds.
[01:49:02.137 --> 01:49:04.878]  So as he's pulling that gun up, how long do you wait?
[01:49:04.998 --> 01:49:07.278]  How long do you wait before you have to defend yourself?
[01:49:07.319 --> 01:49:08.479]  But he was already pointing it at him.
[01:49:08.779 --> 01:49:09.139]  Exactly.
[01:49:09.179 --> 01:49:10.640]  So you're looking down the pearly gates.
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:12.040]  Is that when you're waiting?
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:13.300]  Oh, maybe I should have done it then.
[01:49:13.821 --> 01:49:14.981]  No, no, absolutely not.
[01:49:15.061 --> 01:49:16.641]  So I think Daniel Perry did the right thing.
[01:49:16.661 --> 01:49:19.182]  He defended himself, because if he hadn't, he may not have been here today.
[01:49:19.742 --> 01:49:20.763]  You're talking, these people are...
[01:49:22.063 --> 01:49:29.308]  This mindset of a group of protesters, their mindset is they have a right to block traffic and block the road.
[01:49:29.348 --> 01:49:34.972]  Well, he said, I want to use my gun on cops, which use a gun means kill them, but I can't.
[01:49:35.032 --> 01:49:36.773]  So I'm going to go out and bully these Trump supporters.
[01:49:36.833 --> 01:49:37.374]  They're pussies.
[01:49:37.394 --> 01:49:38.054]  That's the full clip.
[01:49:38.094 --> 01:49:39.095]  That's exactly what he said.
[01:49:39.395 --> 01:49:44.779]  And he said that moments before this actually happened, literally like an hour before the shooting.
[01:49:45.598 --> 01:49:49.262]  Well, I'm not a rocket scientist, but if I walk around waving guns at people, I'm about to get killed.
[01:49:49.562 --> 01:49:49.742]  Right.
[01:49:49.962 --> 01:49:51.904]  And it's crazy, you can't do that.
[01:49:52.665 --> 01:50:01.594]  Now the DA is trying to circumvent, you know, what the governor's trying to do, so we're going to see how this stuff plays out, because now it's a showdown at high noon between the governor and the DA.
[01:50:01.634 --> 01:50:03.596]  What's the left do when the governor pardons it?
[01:50:04.166 --> 01:50:08.085]   They're gonna take to the streets, you know, prepare yourself. The governor is going to pardon this young man
[01:50:08.085 --> 01:50:12.456]   And when he pardons him, they're gonna take to the streets They're gonna protest, they're gonna riot and we're gonna
[01:50:12.456 --> 01:50:16.556]   do us all over again And it's gonna have effects over other cities, not just
[01:50:16.556 --> 01:50:17.046]  Austin.
[01:50:17.046 --> 01:50:24.405]  I hear that the district attorney's not that smart.
[01:50:24.405 --> 01:50:30.005]  No, he's not. But he's using this as a campaign ploy.
[01:50:30.210 --> 01:50:35.091]  So he's using this to actually raise funds for his next campaign because he's trying to get re-elected.
[01:50:35.812 --> 01:50:39.372]  He's, you know, posted, he's sent out emails already, you know.
[01:50:39.493 --> 01:50:42.773]  Well that's my next question, how do we get rid of these Soros people legally and lawfully?
[01:50:42.953 --> 01:50:43.974]  We have to vote them out.
[01:50:44.094 --> 01:50:46.934]  We gotta vote them out of office, that's the only way.
[01:50:47.074 --> 01:50:48.715]  You gotta get to the polls, you gotta go vote.
[01:50:48.835 --> 01:50:50.295]  Is anybody being run against this guy?
[01:50:51.135 --> 01:50:52.536]  Not yet, so we'll see what happens.
[01:50:52.636 --> 01:50:53.836]  Maybe you should run against him.
[01:50:55.450 --> 01:50:56.931]  Oh no, I'm not going to get into politics.
[01:50:57.172 --> 01:50:59.113]  I think I stand here, stand outside the gate.
[01:50:59.153 --> 01:51:02.496]  I can do more work and be more effective by standing where I am today.
[01:51:03.156 --> 01:51:07.280]  Any other facets to this case with Garrett Foster that got killed?
[01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:10.782]  Talk about a Darwin Award, running around the middle of town aiming guns at people.
[01:51:10.823 --> 01:51:12.424]  I mean, that's a quick way to take a dirt nap.
[01:51:12.604 --> 01:51:14.726]  Yeah, it's called F-A-F-O.
[01:51:14.746 --> 01:51:16.167]  The more you F-A, the more you F-O.
[01:51:17.728 --> 01:51:18.629]  F around and find out.
[01:51:18.649 --> 01:51:19.449]  That's right.
[01:51:19.469 --> 01:51:21.151]  The more you F around, the more you're going to find out.
[01:51:22.555 --> 01:51:25.919]  These leftists, though, it's like LARPing to them, you know, live-action role-play.
[01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:30.906]  Like, they just think you run around waving guns at people, and that's to say, I can't believe the cops didn't do something.
[01:51:30.926 --> 01:51:39.216]  Right, and the police officers were there, and they were told to stay back, allow them, allow the protesters to do what they were going to do, as long as they're not...
[01:51:40.157 --> 01:51:42.858]  I guess breaking into businesses, but they can block traffic.
[01:51:43.518 --> 01:51:47.640]  They can, you know, force other people off the street, off the road, and take to the streets.
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:56.283]  And he even said, Garrett Foster even said in his interview just hours before he was actually killed, he said that, you know, we're not allowed to march on the streets.
[01:51:56.303 --> 01:51:57.523]  They don't let us march on the streets.
[01:51:57.683 --> 01:51:58.484]  But he did it anyway.
[01:51:59.264 --> 01:52:03.345]  Speaking of the devil, let's sit in the full interview, because he goes on to say we're going to intimidate these pussy Trump supporters.
[01:52:03.726 --> 01:52:04.846]  Play clip one, going out to break.
[01:52:07.671 --> 01:52:08.913]  No, it's AK-47.
[01:52:08.953 --> 01:52:11.819]  Why'd you got it out tonight?
[01:52:11.699 --> 01:52:16.699]   They don't let us march in the streets anymore, so gotta practice some of our rights.
[01:52:16.699 --> 01:52:21.699]  Do you feel like you'll need to use it?
[01:52:21.699 --> 01:52:22.699]  Nah.
[01:52:23.003 --> 01:52:28.007]  I think the, uh... I mean, if I use it against the cops, I'm dead.
[01:52:28.427 --> 01:52:39.535]  And... I think all the people that hate us and, you know, want to say shit to us are too big of a fuck to stop and actually do anything about it, so... Damn.
[01:52:39.575 --> 01:52:40.996]  Why'd you start carrying?
[01:52:41.236 --> 01:52:46.600]  Well, our roommate got arrested and they stopped letting us march anywhere, so... I started carrying.
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:46.780]  Thanks.
[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:47.060]  Bye!
[01:52:51.003 --> 01:53:06.147]  And he goes on to say, if I use my gun on cops, they'll kill me.
[01:53:06.768 --> 01:53:08.608]  Michael Cargill from Central Texas Gun Works.
[01:53:08.708 --> 01:53:16.811]  I want to shift gears and come back and talk about your federal case, the appeal of the Supreme Court that you won, and these shootings we've been seeing, and where you think this is all going.
[01:53:17.591 --> 01:53:17.871]  Yes, sir.
[01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:19.009]  All right.
[01:53:19.589 --> 01:53:21.390]  Michael Cargill in the studio.
[01:53:21.410 --> 01:53:24.051]  He doesn't just run a big gun store, doesn't just train thousands of people.
[01:53:24.471 --> 01:53:26.512]  He also is battling for all our rights.
[01:53:27.192 --> 01:53:29.873]  A 360 winner with us in studio.
[01:53:29.913 --> 01:53:32.434]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:53:32.494 --> 01:53:36.455]  Tomorrow's News Today and MadmaxWorld.tv.
[01:53:37.315 --> 01:53:45.398]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see footage at a convenience store in New York.
[01:53:47.014 --> 01:53:51.175]  Where a guy walks in, does nothing, and they go ahead and just shoot him in the head for fun.
[01:53:52.055 --> 01:53:55.736]  This is what's going on in New York, where they have almost total gun control.
[01:53:56.696 --> 01:53:59.757]  The next footage I'm going to show is out of Ecuador.
[01:53:59.797 --> 01:54:07.319]  This just happened, where a gang pulls up with illegal guns, guns are totally banned there, and kills rival gang members.
[01:54:09.559 --> 01:54:10.619]  Yeah, roll that footage again.
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:12.480]  They pull up, boom.
[01:54:14.707 --> 01:54:17.308]  Now, total gun control, total gun ban for civilians.
[01:54:18.588 --> 01:54:20.469]  Why is it all the areas where guns are banned?
[01:54:20.509 --> 01:54:24.390]  Why is it the blue cities and blue states in the United States this is happening?
[01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:28.591]  Michael Cargill, one of the really up-and-coming top pro-gun activists in the country.
[01:54:28.631 --> 01:54:35.133]  I've known you for over 13, 14 years, but as you started at Central Texas Gun Works, but now look at the great work you're doing.
[01:54:36.133 --> 01:54:40.214]  How would you describe the state of self-defense in America and the fight?
[01:54:40.234 --> 01:54:45.275]  Because to me, who's not totally immersed in it like you are, I'm kind of like you and Ted Nugent.
[01:54:45.295 --> 01:54:46.895]  People are like right at the top of the fight.
[01:54:46.915 --> 01:54:49.375]  I'm kind of on the periphery, but almost up at the top.
[01:54:49.415 --> 01:54:51.396]  I focus on it every day, but not 100% like you.
[01:54:52.956 --> 01:54:55.016]  It seems to me we're winning the self-defense fight.
[01:54:55.096 --> 01:54:55.716]  People get it.
[01:54:55.776 --> 01:54:57.477]  Liberals are out buying guns in record numbers.
[01:54:58.017 --> 01:54:58.697]  You attest to that.
[01:54:58.757 --> 01:54:59.697]  Other gun shop owners do.
[01:54:59.757 --> 01:55:00.557]  It's happening everywhere.
[01:55:01.317 --> 01:55:03.378]  But they say it's for right-wingers who aren't even threatening them.
[01:55:06.136 --> 01:55:12.299]  What do they do now as people get, oh, there's a mass shooting, which are still rare statistically, that, why does that affect me?
[01:55:12.579 --> 01:55:13.419]  I'm not doing that.
[01:55:13.639 --> 01:55:15.500]  I have a gun to protect myself from that event.
[01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:21.422]  So they don't get, we logically look at all these crazy violent events, like your parents being robbed that got you in the Second Amendment.
[01:55:21.442 --> 01:55:23.443]  You were already an Army veteran, but made you get totally into it.
[01:55:24.203 --> 01:55:25.204]  We're being abused.
[01:55:25.284 --> 01:55:26.064]  We're not bad.
[01:55:26.524 --> 01:55:27.985]  We should be able to protect ourselves.
[01:55:28.025 --> 01:55:31.566]  I mean, everybody kind of gets, hey, I have a right to defend myself.
[01:55:31.586 --> 01:55:32.607]  I'm not a bad person.
[01:55:34.341 --> 01:55:36.523]  And so it seems to me like we're actually winning hearts and minds.
[01:55:37.084 --> 01:55:39.006]  I think the globalists even admit that.
[01:55:39.446 --> 01:55:44.752]  So what are they going to do as no matter what they pull or what propaganda they engage in, it seems to backfire?
[01:55:44.852 --> 01:55:45.933]  Or do you disagree with my statement?
[01:55:46.273 --> 01:55:47.615]  No, I agree with you 100 percent, Alex.
[01:55:48.396 --> 01:56:07.451]   You're having your mainstream media focusing only on These different shootings, whether it's a gang violence, whether it's a workplace violence, you know, they're calling it a mass shooting and just labeling anything that happens, you know, someone walks in and attacks their girlfriend or whatever, you know, it's a mass shooting.
[01:56:07.471 --> 01:56:13.916]  And these things are only happening in your cities and your counties that are actually controlled by the Democrats.
[01:56:14.556 --> 01:56:17.138]  They're not happening in Republican controlled cities.
[01:56:17.298 --> 01:56:18.199]  Almost entirely.
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:20.999]  I'm surprised Republicans are this good.
[01:56:20.999 --> 01:56:23.319]  I mean, entirely.
[01:56:23.319 --> 01:56:24.559]  And here's what that says.
[01:56:24.559 --> 01:56:30.039]   That says that when you're in places where your Republicans are in control of the court
[01:56:30.039 --> 01:56:34.279]   system, they're in control of the law enforcement, they're in control of the city council, they're
[01:56:34.279 --> 01:56:35.940]  putting a stop to these things.
[01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:39.119]   But when you have Democrats in control who are there just like saying, you know, we should
[01:56:39.119 --> 01:56:42.159]   legalize this, we should do this, we're going to drop these charges, we're not going to
[01:56:42.159 --> 01:56:44.920]  allow this to happen, not going to allow that to happen.
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:49.039]   And then you have this out of control chaos like we have here in Austin, we have a city
[01:56:49.039 --> 01:56:52.399]   council that's not doing their job as far as the homeless situation.
[01:56:52.399 --> 01:56:56.960]   We have a police department that, you know, is 300 police officers.
[01:56:56.738 --> 01:57:01.497]   short we have a sheriff you know where's the sheriff in in Travis County no one
[01:57:01.497 --> 01:57:04.298]   even knows who the sheriff is or what that person looks like they don't know
[01:57:04.298 --> 01:57:08.858]   if it's a male or female and so because they never seen the person and then you
[01:57:08.858 --> 01:57:12.298]   have to have the state police come in because you know the leaders in this
[01:57:12.298 --> 01:57:16.617]   area just like in in every other Democrat-controlled city and county
[01:57:16.617 --> 01:57:20.498]   they're allowing the criminals to do whatever they want and they're dropping
[01:57:20.498 --> 01:57:23.417]   the charges and not charging in the way they should. And here's the bottom line
[01:57:23.417 --> 01:57:26.417]  It's unified across the Western world, not just here.
[01:57:26.664 --> 01:57:27.744]  It's a plan, obviously.
[01:57:27.764 --> 01:57:28.644]  Why do you think they're doing it?
[01:57:28.664 --> 01:57:32.144]  Yeah, honestly, I just I can't figure that out.
[01:57:32.304 --> 01:57:34.345]  You know, it just it blows me away.
[01:57:34.425 --> 01:57:39.606]  And I'm thinking maybe because they're doing this because of the next election, the the next presidential election.
[01:57:39.626 --> 01:57:46.007]  They want to make sure that Trump or whoever doesn't get into office so they can't they don't want to lose the the White House.
[01:57:46.727 --> 01:57:52.328]  And they're also trying they're looking at the our justice system and our judges because they're looking at the Supreme Court.
[01:57:52.688 --> 01:57:55.569]  They feel that, you know, it's a little unbalanced right now.
[01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:56.149]  Well, you know what?
[01:57:56.189 --> 01:57:56.989]  That's not our fault.
[01:57:57.549 --> 01:58:02.430]  The fault that the Supreme Court has set the way it is, that's going to be Ruth Bader Ginsburg's fault.
[01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:07.971]  That's her fault, because she should have resigned when it was her time, when she knew that she was getting sick and she needed to resign.
[01:58:08.372 --> 01:58:15.213]  So the fact that the court has now set, you know, more conservatives in that court, you know, they owe that to her.
[01:58:15.273 --> 01:58:16.073]  She's not a hero.
[01:58:16.173 --> 01:58:16.753]  That's her fault.
[01:58:16.813 --> 01:58:18.214]  So the left's throwing a temper tantrum.
[01:58:18.534 --> 01:58:18.914]  Exactly.
[01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:20.931]  So what do you see happening?
[01:58:22.192 --> 01:58:25.934]  I see what I'm telling people, you need to definitely train up.
[01:58:25.994 --> 01:58:41.845]  You need to train, you need to arm yourself, you need to prepare, you need to make sure you have food, you have water, you know, have all these essentials because when this thing, you know, we saw what could happen, you know, with COVID, when everything, you know, shuts down, you know, make you stay in place and all that stuff.
[01:58:41.965 --> 01:58:52.589]   I never would have thought in a million years that You know, I walk outside my door, I get in my vehicle, jump on the interstate, and there's no one on the road in a major city.
[01:58:53.610 --> 01:58:54.550]  I never would have guessed that.
[01:58:54.630 --> 01:58:57.551]  And so they can, that means anything is possible.
[01:58:57.651 --> 01:59:02.132]  So you got to prepare yourself right now, because if you don't, then it's going to be too late.
[01:59:03.452 --> 01:59:08.734]  How would you describe as a Patriot Army veteran, successful businessman, a successful activist?
[01:59:08.794 --> 01:59:14.756]  I mean, you've, you're like, you know, Jack Nicholson when it comes to, you know, getting stuff done and guns.
[01:59:17.242 --> 01:59:18.045]  How do you think this ends?
[01:59:19.538 --> 01:59:26.563]  Hopefully this is going to end where, you know, I take it like no one's going to try to overtake the United States.
[01:59:26.623 --> 01:59:30.885]  No one's going to cross our borders because they know there are guns in almost every single home in this country.
[01:59:31.546 --> 01:59:32.806]  People have multiple firearms.
[01:59:32.866 --> 01:59:36.749]  So I'm hoping that people are listening and they are training.
[01:59:36.989 --> 01:59:37.930]  They are buying guns.
[01:59:38.110 --> 01:59:39.130]  And we saw that in 2020 and 2021 and 2022.
[01:59:39.230 --> 01:59:41.792]  We're seeing this continue on in 2023 where people are buying guns.
[01:59:41.812 --> 01:59:43.093]  They're actually coming.
[01:59:42.913 --> 01:59:47.153]   seeing this continue on in 2023, where people are buying guns, they're actually coming,
[01:59:47.153 --> 01:59:50.313]  they're getting training, and they're learning.
[01:59:50.961 --> 01:59:52.123]  What do you make of the left?
[01:59:52.183 --> 01:59:53.366]  People saw it as really negative.
[01:59:54.235 --> 01:59:57.138]  Four or five years ago under Trump, when the left bought guns, I said no.
[01:59:57.498 --> 02:00:02.783]  They've now realized, even though they have a misguided thing of why they're getting guns, at least they now realize they've got to take care of themselves.
[02:00:03.063 --> 02:00:03.263]  Right.
[02:00:03.584 --> 02:00:10.790]  And you have the federal government, they're trying to arm the federal government to do whatever they want, and that's why I brought my case forward, you know, to stop them.
[02:00:10.810 --> 02:00:11.791]  Yeah, let's start talking about that.
[02:00:11.831 --> 02:00:18.978]  We'll go to break in about three minutes, but you just won a major federal court case, your other case is winning, it's gone to the Supreme Court, the feds just upheld it.
[02:00:19.218 --> 02:00:19.398]  Right.
[02:00:19.698 --> 02:00:22.540]  And so, you know, the feds, who are you talking about?
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:28.923]  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a federal agency, just like the EPA, just like OSHA, they're a federal agency.
[02:00:28.963 --> 02:00:36.866]  And what they're doing is they're deciding to, you know, create laws and rules that, you know, that they're enforcing and putting people in jail for.
[02:00:37.367 --> 02:00:39.067]  And they don't have that authority to do that.
[02:00:39.087 --> 02:00:39.488]  They cannot.
[02:00:39.508 --> 02:00:44.490]  Supreme Court rule last year, the whole EPA deal banning coal power plants on Constitutionals wasn't law.
[02:00:45.110 --> 02:00:45.851]  Absolutely.
[02:00:46.171 --> 02:00:49.194]  And so that power is reserved for Congress.
[02:00:49.254 --> 02:00:51.075]  We have a Constitution in this country.
[02:00:51.636 --> 02:00:52.617]  We have a Bill of Rights.
[02:00:52.677 --> 02:00:53.818]  It's not called a Bill of Needs.
[02:00:53.898 --> 02:00:54.898]  It's called a Bill of Rights.
[02:00:54.979 --> 02:00:56.059]  And they need to follow that.
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:01:02.024]  And so what's happening is they're weaponizing these different agencies to just come in and do whatever they want.
[02:01:02.104 --> 02:01:03.245]  And that has got to stop.
[02:01:03.305 --> 02:01:06.328]  And that's why we filed the lawsuit that I have against the federal government.
[02:01:06.508 --> 02:01:11.711]  Fill us in on that, because you won in the Major Circuit, but now, the Fifth Circuit, now it's called the Supreme Court.
[02:01:11.931 --> 02:01:16.014]  Right, so my case, we won in the Fifth Circuit, which means it's a bump-stock case.
[02:01:16.054 --> 02:01:20.156]  It's a case that says that the federal government cannot create a right law.
[02:01:20.296 --> 02:01:22.658]  It also gives us a definition of what a machine gun is.
[02:01:22.978 --> 02:01:28.822]  It says that, hey, a semi-automatic is when you pull the trigger, each pull of the trigger is a semi-automatic.
[02:01:28.982 --> 02:01:29.802]  One round comes out.
[02:01:30.222 --> 02:01:32.804]  It says a machine gun, when you pull the trigger, you hold the trigger.
[02:01:33.104 --> 02:01:35.445]  Multiple round comes out, that is a machine gun.
[02:01:35.945 --> 02:01:38.246]  And let's be honest, you dunked on Trump.
[02:01:38.646 --> 02:01:39.907]  That was something wrong he did.
[02:01:39.967 --> 02:01:40.767]  You just dunked on him.
[02:01:41.147 --> 02:01:41.728]  Right.
[02:01:41.808 --> 02:01:46.970]  I don't care what side of the fence you're on, I don't care who you are, what political party that you are, you're in.
[02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:53.473]  If you come on my Second Amendment, you try to take my Second Amendment rights from me, I'm going to put my foot on your throat.
[02:01:53.553 --> 02:01:54.253]  And that's my job.
[02:01:55.484 --> 02:01:59.066]  And now they've desperately, 11th hour, they just filed on you.
[02:01:59.766 --> 02:02:04.389]  The 11th hour, the last minute, they filed to appeal this case to the United States Supreme Court.
[02:02:04.609 --> 02:02:06.710]  So I'm excited for this, because that's fine.
[02:02:06.951 --> 02:02:10.232]  Because right now, bump stock should be legal in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi.
[02:02:10.533 --> 02:02:11.553]  So they're appealing this case.
[02:02:11.573 --> 02:02:12.534]  We're going to the Supreme Court.
[02:02:12.554 --> 02:02:13.914]  The Supreme Court takes up this case.
[02:02:14.255 --> 02:02:19.097]  Then we're going to fight in the Supreme Court for all Americans, from 10 to 40 million Americans.
[02:02:19.137 --> 02:02:20.918]  And you got other cases getting picked up.
[02:02:20.958 --> 02:02:22.679]  How'd you hit the, just the right lawyers?
[02:02:22.699 --> 02:02:23.340]  You know what you're doing?
[02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:27.244]  We plan for this case to hit the Supreme Court.
[02:02:27.324 --> 02:02:32.489]  I want to make sure that the attorneys that I chose are capable of fighting the case in the Supreme Court.
[02:02:32.569 --> 02:02:35.111]  We need you on the NRA board.
[02:02:35.872 --> 02:02:37.073]  Why aren't they doing stuff like this?
[02:02:37.534 --> 02:02:39.516]  Why is Cargill doing more than the whole NRA?
[02:02:39.676 --> 02:02:42.118]  Having gotten a phone call from the NRA is still waiting on that phone call.
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:45.322]  Well, we can't just sit around and wait for them to do it.
[02:02:45.502 --> 02:02:46.603]  Michael Cargill's doing it.
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:51.141]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:03:59.179 --> 02:04:03.764]  Michael Cargill, the time we've got left, my brother, I want to give you the floor to talk about big picture.
[02:04:03.824 --> 02:04:07.908]  Not just the Second Amendment, but the Trump indictment, America, your sense of where we are.
[02:04:08.208 --> 02:04:08.408]  Yes.
[02:04:09.008 --> 02:04:20.034]  So, man, this whole plan of trying to actually prosecute former President Trump, all it's going to do is actually put him in the spotlight.
[02:04:20.054 --> 02:04:23.676]  It's going to give him the platform that he actually needs so he can run for office.
[02:04:24.276 --> 02:04:31.880]  I don't know what this big plan that they have, I don't know what's going on with them, but I know it's just not going to work at all.
[02:04:33.401 --> 02:04:43.729]   You have In all these different major cities around the country, I think people are finally realizing that we need to do something, you know, and work a different kind of way.
[02:04:44.369 --> 02:05:02.417]  And that's why we're doing court cases, that's not, that's why we're moving on other, you know, other angles, because you have, you know, these back DAs that are, well, these DAs that are backed by Soros, they're, you know, doing whatever they want to do, and so we need to take a, you know, just a different path a little bit to this.
[02:05:03.362 --> 02:05:05.984]  Well, I notice you, and I'm not kissing your ass, but I admire you.
[02:05:06.544 --> 02:05:08.526]  I've known you, what, 13, 14 years or so?
[02:05:08.646 --> 02:05:09.446]  Yes, sir, quite a while.
[02:05:10.547 --> 02:05:11.548]  And I knew something about you.
[02:05:11.568 --> 02:05:13.609]  You have a great gun shop, great training program.
[02:05:14.350 --> 02:05:16.631]  I took your concealed carry, so did my wife, a lot of the crew.
[02:05:17.659 --> 02:05:27.189]  But the fact is, I love the other gun shops, I love the other gun people, but they always want to keep their head down, and we see hardly no activism from gun shops.
[02:05:27.650 --> 02:05:31.194]  If more gun shops acted like you, we would be in a lot better place.
[02:05:31.774 --> 02:05:33.456]  And that's why we filed this other lawsuit.
[02:05:33.596 --> 02:05:40.681]  There's another lawsuit I have that's Michael Cargill versus the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and that's for all gun stores in the entire country.
[02:05:41.021 --> 02:05:44.824]  Because what's happening is gun stores are being inspected by the ATF.
[02:05:44.844 --> 02:05:56.852]  This current administration, the Biden administration, has decided to attack gun stores by inspecting us and if they find any errors whatsoever, any little small paperwork error, you walk in the gun store, you have to fill out the form.
[02:05:56.892 --> 02:06:01.995]  If you make a mistake on that form, there are 100 different data points on the form when you're buying a gun.
[02:06:03.656 --> 02:06:11.918]  If you don't cross a T, you don't dot an I, then you make a certain amount of those same mistakes, then what they're doing is they're revoking the gun store's license.
[02:06:11.998 --> 02:06:19.619]  And you're talking gun stores that have been in business for decades, several family, you know, just decades, 20 years.
[02:06:19.759 --> 02:06:21.700]  So, but I'm not praising you, but it's true.
[02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:23.140]  Why are you different?
[02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:24.020]  Because I watch you.
[02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:27.501]  You're all over national news, you're all over local news since you came out of the gates.
[02:06:28.326 --> 02:06:31.489]  You literally are doing more than almost all the other gun shops combined.
[02:06:31.509 --> 02:06:32.389]  There's thousands of them.
[02:06:32.690 --> 02:06:33.850]  So I'm not kissing your ass.
[02:06:34.091 --> 02:06:35.011]  Why are you different?
[02:06:35.312 --> 02:06:37.573]  Why don't other gun shops get off their ass?
[02:06:38.074 --> 02:06:40.496]  Well, I don't know if they're not doing anything.
[02:06:40.576 --> 02:06:42.717]  I just focus on what I'm doing.
[02:06:42.958 --> 02:06:55.865]   They may be doing something, but I know that we need to get together and This case, the second case, is very important because the second case actually puts this Biden administration where they need to be.
[02:06:55.885 --> 02:07:15.755]   It's saying, hey, you cannot take the law that says that ATF walks into a gun store, they're supposed to inspect the gun store, they're supposed to assist that gun store in making sure that a gun does not wind up in the hands of a prohibited person, and you're supposed to, you know, The violation, it's not they're giving guns to prohibited persons, they're just finding minor errors.
[02:07:15.835 --> 02:07:16.375]  That is correct.
[02:07:16.435 --> 02:07:23.701]  And the whole purpose of the law is if a gun store is actually transferring a firearm to a prohibited person, then that gun store is actually breaking the law.
[02:07:23.901 --> 02:07:29.845]  But that's not what's happening, because I didn't dot my I across my T, that is not putting the guns in the hands of a prohibited person.
[02:07:30.486 --> 02:07:32.447]  But they're taking that and they're shutting the gun stores.
[02:07:32.467 --> 02:07:34.809]  By the way, I'm not bashing the gun shops, I'm being honest.
[02:07:36.170 --> 02:07:40.593]   I see you in the national news and local news all the time, you're like, But this is ridiculous!
[02:07:40.693 --> 02:07:40.833]  Right.
[02:07:40.993 --> 02:07:43.915]  I think people... I mean, do you feel a little weird that it's almost always you fighting?
[02:07:44.135 --> 02:07:45.495]  People are just afraid to stand up.
[02:07:45.535 --> 02:07:49.478]  They're afraid to stand up because they think that when they do stand up, someone's gonna come for them.
[02:07:49.538 --> 02:07:50.078]  And I get it.
[02:07:50.258 --> 02:07:50.758]  I understand.
[02:07:50.798 --> 02:07:52.179]  Because that's why we did the other lawsuit.
[02:07:52.199 --> 02:07:54.981]  Because we said, hey, we're winning the bump stock case.
[02:07:55.001 --> 02:07:56.221]  We're headed to the Supreme Court.
[02:07:56.602 --> 02:08:00.864]  We're actually gonna beat the ATF and the Department of Justice in... You already won at the 5th Circuit.
[02:08:01.004 --> 02:08:01.344]  That's right.
[02:08:01.464 --> 02:08:02.825]  We're beating them on their turf.
[02:08:02.945 --> 02:08:06.608]  And because of that, what stops them from walking to my gun store and shutting me down?
[02:08:07.028 --> 02:08:08.469]  And I said, you know, we need to protect ourselves.
[02:08:08.509 --> 02:08:10.591]  I need to play chess, not play checkers.
[02:08:10.711 --> 02:08:12.973]  And we can't just be on defense.
[02:08:13.473 --> 02:08:14.173]  We've got to be on offense.
[02:08:14.213 --> 02:08:14.734]  That is correct.
[02:08:14.854 --> 02:08:17.416]  And so we're taking this on an offensive stance.
[02:08:17.856 --> 02:08:19.577]  And we're saying, you know what, we're going to push this forward.
[02:08:19.737 --> 02:08:21.959]  And imagine if other people took the cargo model.
[02:08:22.179 --> 02:08:22.539]  That's right.
[02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:24.141]  That's right.
[02:08:24.804 --> 02:08:25.864]  Because you are the man of the arena.
[02:08:26.205 --> 02:08:26.565]  That's right.
[02:08:27.165 --> 02:08:27.485]  That's right.
[02:08:27.585 --> 02:08:28.826]  What else do you want to impart to listeners?
[02:08:30.026 --> 02:08:34.168]  You know, go to our website, go to michaelcargill.com, check it out there, go to Central Texas Gunner Works.
[02:08:34.348 --> 02:08:35.849]  You host a podcast, very popular?
[02:08:35.889 --> 02:08:37.810]  Yes, we do Come and Talk It radio show.
[02:08:37.850 --> 02:08:40.371]  It's Come and Talk It, not Come and Take It, Come and Talk It.
[02:08:40.591 --> 02:08:44.933]  We talk all things firearms, anything that has anything to do with guns at all, we're discussing that.
[02:08:44.953 --> 02:08:56.219]   We're talking about different court cases, we're talking about the Austin Serial Killer, we're talking about the Daniel Perry case, we're talking with witnesses that were down on the ground, we try to break And the police officer filed an affidavit.
[02:08:56.038 --> 02:08:59.038]  wide open and see what's going on.
[02:08:59.038 --> 02:09:04.217]   There's a juror that actually went and actually testified, well actually gave a statement
[02:09:04.217 --> 02:09:08.998]   on a radio show just yesterday, and the juror that was in a Daniel Perry case said that
[02:09:08.998 --> 02:09:15.679]   they were not given any evidence of any pictures or video of Garrett Foster pointing a gun
[02:09:15.679 --> 02:09:16.679]  at Daniel Perry.
[02:09:16.679 --> 02:09:17.679]  They didn't see any of that.
[02:09:17.679 --> 02:09:20.398]   And the police officer filed an affidavit, they're hiding that.
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:27.003]  And so, you know, things like that, we're trying to bust this stuff wide open because the jury was not given certain information.
[02:09:27.023 --> 02:09:28.784]  They didn't have everything to make the decision.
[02:09:29.204 --> 02:09:30.945]  And I'm not saying anything about the jurors.
[02:09:31.005 --> 02:09:33.166]  I'm not bashing the jurors because they did their job.
[02:09:33.206 --> 02:09:40.070]  They took two weeks out of their life to sit down, listen to this case, not get paid, you know, get paid peanuts to listen to this.
[02:09:40.211 --> 02:09:45.814]  So I don't want to bash the jurors at all because they did the best they could do with the evidence that they had in front of them.
[02:09:46.764 --> 02:09:52.390]  In closing, what's the time frame on the 5th Circuit bump stock man, you won, going to the Supreme Court?
[02:09:52.830 --> 02:09:55.493]  Right, so right now we have until May 6th.
[02:09:55.933 --> 02:10:05.542]  For other parties, I'm asking for other organizations out there, 2A organizations, anyone that wants to, you know, file a brief for our case.
[02:10:05.702 --> 02:10:06.223]  Amicus brief.
[02:10:06.383 --> 02:10:06.783]  That's right.
[02:10:06.823 --> 02:10:10.165]  We need the amicus briefs to be filed before May 6th.
[02:10:10.405 --> 02:10:16.609]  So that way, and that date can be extended, but as of right now, the deadline is May 6th for all the amicus briefs.
[02:10:16.949 --> 02:10:20.151]  So we're wanting those to come in right now to assist us.
[02:10:20.291 --> 02:10:24.074]  I don't care if it's the NRA, the NAGR, the Gunners of America.
[02:10:24.454 --> 02:10:39.704]   I'm asking, you know, any law firm, organization, New York State, you know, Rifle Association, Texas State Rifle Association to assist us because this is a very important court case because this case here We'll be affected by other cases as we move forward down the road.
[02:10:40.084 --> 02:10:45.208]  This case will be the case law for other cases that will defend all Americans.
[02:10:45.228 --> 02:10:46.989]  Because it's all about them making law without law.
[02:10:47.189 --> 02:10:47.629]  That's right.
[02:10:47.649 --> 02:10:50.732]  We're talking 10 to 40 million Americans are going to be affected by this.
[02:10:51.332 --> 02:10:51.712]  40 million.
[02:10:52.313 --> 02:10:58.197]  Well, I'm just glad you showed up at the plate because it took a couple years after his bump stock, man, you challenged it and won.
[02:10:58.938 --> 02:11:00.319]  I'm just surprised other people didn't do it.
[02:11:00.859 --> 02:11:05.161]  Yeah, and so there were other cases out there, but they took a different, a different playbook.
[02:11:05.822 --> 02:11:08.203]  So we took it from a totally different angle.
[02:11:08.843 --> 02:11:10.824]  We wanted to play chess with this, not check.
[02:11:10.884 --> 02:11:11.905]  You didn't even go to the T.O.A.
[02:11:11.925 --> 02:11:12.285]  Did you?
[02:11:12.345 --> 02:11:12.725]  You went.
[02:11:12.825 --> 02:11:14.246]  They can't make law outside of Congress.
[02:11:14.266 --> 02:11:14.686]  That's right.
[02:11:14.746 --> 02:11:15.607]  So we didn't go to T.O.A.
[02:11:15.627 --> 02:11:16.167]  stance at all.
[02:11:17.308 --> 02:11:17.648]  That's right.
[02:11:18.068 --> 02:11:18.889]  And that was your strategy.
[02:11:19.089 --> 02:11:19.429]  That's right.
[02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:21.730]  Got the big brain over here.
[02:11:25.055 --> 02:11:25.415]  Oh, man.
[02:11:25.475 --> 02:11:26.815]  I tell you, Alex, it is fun, though.
[02:11:26.835 --> 02:11:27.296]  This is fun.
[02:11:27.336 --> 02:11:29.036]  This is fun, you know, taking it to the government.
[02:11:29.056 --> 02:11:30.356]  This is fun stopping the government.
[02:11:30.636 --> 02:11:31.417]  I enjoy this work.
[02:11:31.817 --> 02:11:33.017]  I mean, I'm doing it for the people.
[02:11:33.197 --> 02:11:34.257]  I'm not doing this for myself.
[02:11:34.277 --> 02:11:36.298]  All right, Michael Cargill out of the park.
[02:11:36.338 --> 02:11:38.458]  Maria Z's got a raft of incredible guests.
[02:11:38.818 --> 02:11:41.059]  Breaking news from Australia, the front line of the attacks.
[02:11:41.419 --> 02:11:42.919]  She takes over in 55 minutes.
[02:11:43.099 --> 02:11:44.480]  Owen Schroer, 3 p.m.
[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:45.360]  Central, The War Room.
[02:11:45.279 --> 02:11:49.158]  Infowars.com/show and Madmaxworld.tv.
[02:11:49.158 --> 02:12:10.599]   If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[02:12:10.599 --> 02:12:13.340]  (dramatic music)
[02:12:14.042 --> 02:12:18.925]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for President 2024 shirt.
[02:12:19.966 --> 02:12:22.348]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[02:12:22.368 --> 02:12:26.311]  This is an idea the crew had, to have a triggering shirt, kind of next level.
[02:12:26.371 --> 02:12:27.211]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:12:27.611 --> 02:12:31.554]  There's Infowars.com on the back, Alex Jones for President 2024 on the front.
[02:12:31.975 --> 02:12:32.975]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[02:12:33.015 --> 02:12:34.256]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[02:12:34.276 --> 02:12:34.977]  It's high quality.
[02:12:35.617 --> 02:12:38.439]  And it is a exclusive shirt to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:12:39.039 --> 02:12:40.841]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[02:12:40.881 --> 02:12:41.981]  We're doing one run.
[02:12:42.882 --> 02:12:44.703]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:44.563 --> 02:12:50.942]   2024 shirts and we'll have a historic memento be able to spread the word meet a lot of like-minded people and
[02:12:50.942 --> 02:12:56.042]   You'll be able to keep us on the air. No way. No way. That's a bridge too far
[02:12:56.042 --> 02:13:01.742]   That's no it can't be and I said on national television that he was gonna win and in for store
[02:13:01.742 --> 02:13:06.863]   calm Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm your guest host
[02:13:06.863 --> 02:13:15.101]   Maria Z here with you today from the land down under I Want to talk today about the absolute
[02:13:15.101 --> 02:13:20.181]   moral decay of society
[02:13:19.636 --> 02:13:22.697]  Jason Whitlock was recently on Tucker Carlson.
[02:13:23.297 --> 02:13:27.197]  He's made a couple of appearances lately that have been especially powerful.
[02:13:28.337 --> 02:13:32.278]  First of all, it was when the news of the Trump indictment first came out.
[02:13:33.098 --> 02:13:44.600]  He was obviously very, very disturbed by the things that were happening in the United States at the time, the transgender terrorist in Nashville and then the Trump indictment.
[02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:48.641]  And then he appeared again just a few days ago.
[02:13:50.254 --> 02:14:04.442]  When talking about Trump and talking about the way that the left is and how can we possibly coexist with such a morally decayed people.
[02:14:04.482 --> 02:14:10.325]  It was a very, very powerful segment and I want to play it now for everyone if the team can get that ready.
[02:14:11.044 --> 02:14:14.986]  The Righteous can't have partnership with the Lawless.
[02:14:15.026 --> 02:14:22.188]  This is, this is, I mean, it's stuck with me ever since I heard it and I've done a lot of thinking on it and I want to talk about that today.
[02:14:22.628 --> 02:14:23.609]  But here's the clip now.
[02:14:27.590 --> 02:14:29.131]  It looks like the team don't have it ready yet.
[02:14:29.171 --> 02:14:29.691]  That's okay.
[02:14:31.712 --> 02:14:34.933]  The Righteous can't have partnership with the Lawless.
[02:14:36.474 --> 02:14:40.275]  You can't mix the two together.
[02:14:40.902 --> 02:14:48.505]  And we've spent all of this time and effort in trying to reach people that don't want debate.
[02:14:49.706 --> 02:14:52.867]  They don't want genuine conversation.
[02:14:52.927 --> 02:14:56.829]  They don't want a genuine exchange of ideas.
[02:14:58.590 --> 02:15:00.491]  There is no attempt.
[02:15:02.132 --> 02:15:03.972]  I can't remember where the clip was yesterday.
[02:15:03.992 --> 02:15:04.973]  It might've even been on.
[02:15:06.118 --> 02:15:17.344]  No, it wasn't Owen, it was somewhere else, but it was showing a gentleman attending a trans rally, a journalist, and he was trying to ask them questions.
[02:15:18.865 --> 02:15:20.946]  He was saying, why are you here to protest?
[02:15:21.066 --> 02:15:22.647]  What are you protesting about?
[02:15:23.464 --> 02:15:33.929]  And the protester just blew a whistle and wouldn't respond to the journalist asking, who was simply there to try and understand, why are you actually here protesting right now?
[02:15:33.989 --> 02:15:34.450]  What is it?
[02:15:34.810 --> 02:15:36.651]  What is it that's drawn you here today?
[02:15:36.671 --> 02:15:39.532]  And you just blow a whistle.
[02:15:39.572 --> 02:15:44.515]  There's no, they have no interest in understanding the other side.
[02:15:47.659 --> 02:15:48.843]  We've got the clip up now.
[02:15:49.285 --> 02:15:53.058]  I'll get the team to bring it up and then I want to expand on this.
[02:15:54.426 --> 02:16:04.975]  These guys are so far removed from the truth, so far removed from any of the values that made this country great, we can't really have partnership with them.
[02:16:05.175 --> 02:16:11.200]  And my mindset went to secession, that we have to separate, we have to come out from among them.
[02:16:11.601 --> 02:16:30.074]   They're so unrighteous, they're so unclean, that finding common ground is impossible with people who think men can become women, Who told us, hey look, we just want two men to be able to get married and there's no slippery slope.
[02:16:30.815 --> 02:16:31.695]  And that was a lie.
[02:16:32.095 --> 02:16:33.656]  And we've seen the slippery slope.
[02:16:33.916 --> 02:16:36.818]  Now it's drag queens reading books to kids.
[02:16:36.898 --> 02:16:39.159]  Now it's taking kids to drag queen shows.
[02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:49.806]  Now it's mutilating kids and infecting them with gender dysphoria and using it as an excuse to cut off their breasts or cut off their penis.
[02:16:50.746 --> 02:16:53.089]  You can't have peace.
[02:16:53.389 --> 02:16:55.091]  You can't have partnership with these people.
[02:16:55.332 --> 02:17:06.365]  There are so many lies stacked on top of lies, from the whole Black Lives Matter, George Floyd deal, and oh, the police are just out indiscriminately killing black men and it's so dangerous because of the police.
[02:17:06.766 --> 02:17:08.588]  That's all a lie and everybody knows it.
[02:17:09.049 --> 02:17:19.998]   We can't Find common ground with people who have no respect for the truth, no respect for justice, no respect for fairness.
[02:17:20.878 --> 02:17:23.780]  We have to think about going our separate ways.
[02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:39.946]   And whether that's through secession or whether that's through some sort of national divorce, it has to be on the table because you just can't find common ground with people this delusional Who think that they're God and they can make up the rules.
[02:17:40.846 --> 02:17:54.049]  And so, I just, I don't see a pathway forward for those of us that respect America's founding, have traditional values, have a faith in God.
[02:17:55.309 --> 02:17:56.289]  We gotta separate.
[02:17:56.629 --> 02:18:05.991]  And I don't care how it's done, but I just don't see a way to coexist with people this far removed from truth.
[02:18:07.037 --> 02:18:13.021]  I think most decent people, no matter where they live or who they vote for, want to find common ground.
[02:18:13.101 --> 02:18:15.623]  I don't see any effort to find common ground from the other side.
[02:18:15.703 --> 02:18:16.064]  Do you?
[02:18:16.184 --> 02:18:18.385]  Looking for it, want to see it, don't see it.
[02:18:19.366 --> 02:18:19.586]  No.
[02:18:20.107 --> 02:18:20.287]  No.
[02:18:20.587 --> 02:18:27.832]  And look, there was a time I had many liberal friends that I loved and I could find common ground with them.
[02:18:28.513 --> 02:18:37.724]   But now, if I have to agree that men can get pregnant, I have to agree that children should be subjected to drag queens, Can't do it.
[02:18:41.507 --> 02:18:41.928]  I mean it.
[02:18:42.028 --> 02:18:45.331]  This has really stuck with me ever since I watched it.
[02:18:45.371 --> 02:18:48.254]  I've been thinking about it every single day.
[02:18:49.034 --> 02:18:52.137]  Jason essentially said what so many of us are thinking out loud.
[02:18:52.177 --> 02:19:00.145]  I mean, we, on the side of truth, spend so much time to reach the other side.
[02:19:00.993 --> 02:19:10.780]  We spend all of our effort combating the actual misinformation that's coming out from the globalists to try to wake people up.
[02:19:10.940 --> 02:19:13.001]  Alex has been doing this for decades.
[02:19:13.301 --> 02:19:20.767]  You know, there are people, InfoWars has been at the front lines of this information war for so long.
[02:19:22.268 --> 02:19:28.472]  And yet the other side doesn't ever try to do that, especially now.
[02:19:29.662 --> 02:19:31.243]  Especially now, and how?
[02:19:31.663 --> 02:19:39.225]  How can we sit and have a meal with someone who is so far removed from the truth?
[02:19:40.846 --> 02:19:44.027]  With someone who thinks it's fine to mutilate children?
[02:19:44.187 --> 02:19:50.248]  You know, as Jason says, there was a time where I used to be able to sit with my liberal friends and find common ground.
[02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:52.929]  I can't do that anymore.
[02:19:52.949 --> 02:19:54.910]  I can't.
[02:19:55.523 --> 02:19:57.943]  We can't sit and share a meal.
[02:19:58.904 --> 02:20:04.465]  We can't sit at the table with people who want to cut children's genitals off.
[02:20:07.045 --> 02:20:08.565]  We can't have you in our house.
[02:20:09.566 --> 02:20:18.847]  We can't share anything personal with them because they turn it into something about them or they use it against you later on.
[02:20:18.867 --> 02:20:21.808]  They're thinking.
[02:20:22.677 --> 02:20:31.243]  The thinking of so many people in society is so inverted, so morally devoid.
[02:20:31.263 --> 02:20:34.665]  I struggle.
[02:20:35.586 --> 02:20:41.770]  I struggle to think, how are we actually ever going to reach these people?
[02:20:42.250 --> 02:20:46.004]   And, you know, I'm not talking about people that are In the middle.
[02:20:46.044 --> 02:20:48.285]  I'm talking about people on the far left now.
[02:20:48.305 --> 02:21:00.708]  I'm talking about the extremists, the real extremists in society, who worship the God of science and the God of self, which all eventually lead back to Satan.
[02:21:02.169 --> 02:21:03.429]  I'm talking about these people.
[02:21:04.169 --> 02:21:04.869]  You can't.
[02:21:05.369 --> 02:21:06.510]  You just cannot.
[02:21:06.570 --> 02:21:13.115]   There is It's like trying to put magnets together and they're just repelling each other.
[02:21:13.415 --> 02:21:19.038]  It feels like we're just repelled by one another and it's no longer left or right.
[02:21:19.199 --> 02:21:26.343]  It's good and evil and that is becoming so much more apparent in society.
[02:21:26.403 --> 02:21:36.310]  You have something that is complete evil and something that is good and righteous and virtuous.
[02:21:37.734 --> 02:21:42.738]  And the evil doesn't want anything good and righteous and virtuous.
[02:21:42.778 --> 02:21:46.181]  It's not even about, we don't want to find common ground.
[02:21:46.221 --> 02:21:49.543]  They don't want to find common ground with us or they don't want to understand us.
[02:21:49.583 --> 02:21:50.064]  No, no, no.
[02:21:50.524 --> 02:21:58.750]  They want to sit in their sin and let it fester like a sore infecting their very soul.
[02:21:58.770 --> 02:22:03.494]  They want it.
[02:22:03.594 --> 02:22:07.237]  It's like an addiction for these people and it is.
[02:22:08.519 --> 02:22:16.103]  It is because it's not just their way of thinking that doesn't align with our values.
[02:22:17.203 --> 02:22:18.244]  It's evil.
[02:22:18.524 --> 02:22:23.306]  They have let evil completely overtake their hearts.
[02:22:26.628 --> 02:22:31.850]  When in history have we ever sacrificed the young to save the old?
[02:22:32.650 --> 02:22:35.792]  This has never happened and yet these people were screaming for it.
[02:22:35.892 --> 02:22:38.073]  Inject your children to the eyeballs!
[02:22:38.789 --> 02:22:39.930]  To save Grandma.
[02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:48.881]  I want to talk about some more of the way these people think and our solution right after this short break.
[02:22:49.261 --> 02:22:50.082]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:22:50.102 --> 02:22:53.006]  I think this is a really interesting topic.
[02:22:53.874 --> 02:22:55.914]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:56.034 --> 02:22:57.455]  I'm your guest host, Maria Zee.
[02:22:57.535 --> 02:23:01.596]  Talking about how we are going to move forward as a society.
[02:23:01.696 --> 02:23:08.457]  Is it time to cut the cords with those who think that a man can be a woman?
[02:23:08.477 --> 02:23:10.917]  A child should be mutilated.
[02:23:11.178 --> 02:23:13.118]  We should lower the age of consent.
[02:23:13.438 --> 02:23:18.119]  Let's, you know, redefine pedophiles to minor attracted individuals.
[02:23:19.192 --> 02:23:24.535]  I mean, how much further can we go with people who just want to fester in their sin?
[02:23:26.877 --> 02:23:29.398]  Alex says this is a psychotic death cult.
[02:23:29.418 --> 02:23:31.079]  That's exactly what they are.
[02:23:32.180 --> 02:23:37.983]  Not only are they a psychotic death cult, they want to groom your children.
[02:23:38.143 --> 02:23:40.445]  They want to touch your children.
[02:23:41.405 --> 02:23:50.788]  They said, we're coming for your children in their little, you know, the top left hand corner, that video that's playing now from the gay choir.
[02:23:51.228 --> 02:23:52.948]  We're coming for your children.
[02:23:53.788 --> 02:23:55.489]  We'll convert your children.
[02:23:55.509 --> 02:23:58.250]  This is a cult.
[02:23:59.090 --> 02:23:59.910]  It is a religion.
[02:24:00.830 --> 02:24:07.032]  It is a religion of self and their God, by the way, the real God, is transgender.
[02:24:09.032 --> 02:24:10.613]  This is why they're so hell bent.
[02:24:11.514 --> 02:24:26.739]  On mutilating your children and changing their gender, and convincing you, and all of the people that have been brainwashed over the years by the television, that you can change your gender.
[02:24:30.599 --> 02:24:32.599]  Excuse me.
[02:24:32.599 --> 02:24:38.599]  My apologies.
[02:24:38.599 --> 02:24:48.599]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:24:45.319 --> 02:24:48.440]  Sorry everyone, having a problem here.
[02:24:48.440 --> 02:25:05.440]   When you talk all day and you're passionate, sometimes this happens.
[02:25:05.949 --> 02:25:07.169]  Thank you so much for your patience.
[02:25:09.050 --> 02:25:15.113]  We're talking about a cult that wants to infect every single part of society.
[02:25:16.365 --> 02:25:21.826]  And through satanic Hollywood, for the most part, has done so successfully.
[02:25:23.926 --> 02:25:35.889]  They have done so over the years, permeating the minds of people to lead us to the point now where there is no common sense anymore.
[02:25:39.049 --> 02:25:43.050]  We have world leaders who are unable to define what a woman is.
[02:25:44.474 --> 02:25:45.514]  What is this alchemy?
[02:25:45.554 --> 02:25:53.238]  When have we ever seen so many world leaders at once say, I can't define what a woman is?
[02:25:53.478 --> 02:25:53.918]  I don't know.
[02:25:53.938 --> 02:25:57.219]  What do you mean you can't define what a woman is?
[02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:01.801]  Think about the term politically correct.
[02:26:02.601 --> 02:26:07.103]  Since when are politicians the marker for correctness?
[02:26:08.964 --> 02:26:16.171]   But in this religion of science, in this religion Of the new world.
[02:26:17.351 --> 02:26:18.932]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:26:18.992 --> 02:26:21.833]  You know, you have them saying, we are the science.
[02:26:21.873 --> 02:26:23.553]  We're going to tell you what the science is.
[02:26:23.974 --> 02:26:24.874]  We dictate it.
[02:26:25.274 --> 02:26:29.336]  We're the ultimate source of truth and you will obey or else.
[02:26:31.797 --> 02:26:41.859]   So how then, for the people that don't see through the agenda, for the people that are unable to see that they are being fooled, And just won't.
[02:26:42.819 --> 02:26:44.600]  They can't cross that threshold.
[02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:47.162]  They will buy the lies no matter what the lies are.
[02:26:47.542 --> 02:26:52.266]  No matter how much you chop up the vomit and serve it to them on a plate, they will lap it up.
[02:26:54.727 --> 02:26:57.869]  How do you come together with people like that?
[02:26:57.929 --> 02:26:58.550]  You can't!
[02:26:58.590 --> 02:27:00.091]  There's no way!
[02:27:00.111 --> 02:27:05.194]  Have a look at the current destruction of Budweiser.
[02:27:05.214 --> 02:27:07.716]  I think it's very interesting.
[02:27:08.437 --> 02:27:35.145]   You know, you've got sales reps out there saying, But Budweiser sales reps saying, well, I don't know if I'm going to be out of a job because no one wants the products after Dylan Mulvaney, a man, a man that dresses as a woman, as a little girl out there promoting your products.
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:42.921]  So sorry guys, this tickle in my throat will not go away.
[02:27:42.941 --> 02:27:48.443]  The athlete female of the year is a man.
[02:27:50.524 --> 02:27:53.985]  Women's sports are dominated by men.
[02:27:55.165 --> 02:27:56.466]  Everything is backwards.
[02:27:56.966 --> 02:28:13.707]   But you look at Budweiser, Bud Light, sorry, and the way that so many people are boycotting It shows you that there is still such a huge part of society that doesn't want this, that won't buy into this.
[02:28:14.447 --> 02:28:16.427]  There are still so many of us.
[02:28:18.388 --> 02:28:20.049]  So how can we move forward then?
[02:28:20.949 --> 02:28:22.270]  Boycott every time, sure.
[02:28:25.411 --> 02:28:26.951]  Continue to boycott, no problem.
[02:28:27.591 --> 02:28:34.714]  But the problem is, it doesn't just end at boycott, because they'll come back again.
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:37.341]  They'll come back with another drag queen.
[02:28:38.002 --> 02:28:40.704]  They'll come back with another Dylan Mulvaney.
[02:28:42.225 --> 02:28:44.847]  They'll come back with more degeneracy.
[02:28:46.868 --> 02:28:47.849]  It will continue.
[02:28:51.271 --> 02:28:57.195]  They will keep coming at you with evil because these people are evil.
[02:28:57.215 --> 02:29:06.416]   There's a scripture that says, But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door.
[02:29:07.536 --> 02:29:10.977]  It desires to have you, but you must master it.
[02:29:12.918 --> 02:29:14.879]  These people do not want to master sin.
[02:29:16.119 --> 02:29:16.899]  They live in it.
[02:29:18.460 --> 02:29:19.200]  They live in it.
[02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:20.240]  We've lost God.
[02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:26.962]  We have absolutely lost God and put all of our faith in the current world religion of science.
[02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:35.071]  Kids these days have more injections before they've left the hospital than people used to have in their entire lifetime.
[02:29:37.292 --> 02:29:44.313]  You know, in some circumstances, pharma has its place with penicillin and other drugs that have saved lives over the years.
[02:29:45.354 --> 02:29:47.214]  But that's not what pharma is anymore.
[02:29:47.234 --> 02:29:50.315]  Pharma is what you're seeing on your screen right now.
[02:29:50.375 --> 02:29:52.695]  That's what pharma is promoting.
[02:29:52.715 --> 02:29:56.376]  Pharma is promoting cutting off your breasts.
[02:29:57.932 --> 02:29:59.713]  When you're, you know, 10 years old.
[02:30:00.254 --> 02:30:03.616]  Well, you don't have fully grown breasts at that age, but you understand what I'm saying.
[02:30:03.676 --> 02:30:19.448]  If farmer is promoting the unnatural order of Satan, the inversion of God's creation, like this preacher.
[02:30:22.170 --> 02:30:27.775]  It's so interesting because the left was always anti-government, anti-authoritarian, anti-war.
[02:30:28.836 --> 02:30:33.239]  They claim to be anti-war but really they're just anti-Putin with a Ukraine flag in Baia.
[02:30:33.279 --> 02:30:35.781]  They don't even know what it stands for.
[02:30:39.244 --> 02:30:40.806]  They're pro-unrest.
[02:30:41.826 --> 02:30:44.429]  They're pro-BLM destroying everything.
[02:30:46.450 --> 02:30:48.392]  When they do that they all stay silent.
[02:30:50.131 --> 02:30:54.633]  They stay silent on the absolute decimation of the woman.
[02:30:55.913 --> 02:30:57.914]  Men taking over women in society.
[02:30:57.974 --> 02:30:59.495]  Where are the feminists now?
[02:30:59.615 --> 02:31:08.158]  Where are the feminists now when you have grown-ass men dominating women's sports?
[02:31:08.218 --> 02:31:09.278]  Where are you?
[02:31:09.318 --> 02:31:12.700]  Well, we have a handful of loud voices out there.
[02:31:12.920 --> 02:31:14.900]  Where are the feminists now?
[02:31:15.180 --> 02:31:16.321]  The pro-women!
[02:31:18.080 --> 02:31:18.821]  I'll tell you where they are.
[02:31:18.861 --> 02:31:20.823]  They have a Ukraine flag in bio.
[02:31:20.843 --> 02:31:23.925]  And they're thinking about how they're going to mutilate their kids.
[02:31:24.346 --> 02:31:26.467]  Because that's what the feminist movement turned into.
[02:31:27.148 --> 02:31:29.890]  Everything has been weaponized towards the agenda.
[02:31:29.910 --> 02:31:32.292]  We'll keep going right after this short break.
[02:31:33.153 --> 02:31:37.116]  Politics has become so ruthless and disgusting.
[02:31:37.176 --> 02:31:39.238]  The corruption is out of control.
[02:31:39.638 --> 02:31:46.304]  Everything down to music, performing outright satanic acts in front of our faces.
[02:31:48.061 --> 02:31:49.863]  At the Super Bowl, for goodness sake!
[02:31:50.144 --> 02:31:51.245]  Children watch that!
[02:31:51.265 --> 02:32:07.644]  We've got so-called health rights, which are actually the right to murder children, people screaming in the streets for the right to slaughter unborn children.
[02:32:09.525 --> 02:32:16.889]  You've got poison injections being told to us by all governments that they're great and they're safe.
[02:32:16.969 --> 02:32:22.793]  And if in the event that people don't know that mRNA is a bad thing by now, they want it in our food.
[02:32:24.634 --> 02:32:25.974]  It's so glorious.
[02:32:26.014 --> 02:32:27.996]  We're going to inject our cattle with it.
[02:32:28.016 --> 02:32:29.697]  We're going to inject our chickens with it.
[02:32:29.957 --> 02:32:31.958]  We've got mRNA lettuce for you.
[02:32:34.147 --> 02:32:36.290]  We reported on this last week on Zero Time.
[02:32:36.310 --> 02:32:43.041]  If you haven't seen it, it should be up on Band.Video now on the Z Media channel.
[02:32:43.962 --> 02:32:45.224]  It's unbelievable.
[02:32:45.324 --> 02:32:49.291]  It's unbelievable that they're pushing lab-grown meat, mRNA meat.
[02:32:50.748 --> 02:33:04.435]  The media whose whole, sole job used to be to report the news and keep the government to account is nothing more than a bullhorn to just shut down anyone who goes against the government narrative.
[02:33:04.495 --> 02:33:05.936]  It is so corrupt.
[02:33:06.316 --> 02:33:11.199]  The corruption is like a turbo cancer.
[02:33:14.221 --> 02:33:16.722]  And you see all of this and you think, how?
[02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:20.451]  How do people still believe this?
[02:33:20.491 --> 02:33:22.372]  How do they believe the lies?
[02:33:25.193 --> 02:33:37.777]  Everyone that listens to this broadcast knows this, but sometimes it's important to remember how they've been brainwashed by the TV, they've been brainwashed by the corporations.
[02:33:37.797 --> 02:33:50.559]   They've been brainwashed through society because this type of thinking goes into society no matter what No matter what you think, you know, it started with, let's just bake the cake.
[02:33:51.759 --> 02:33:52.720]  Love is love.
[02:33:55.041 --> 02:33:56.962]  Sure, two men can get married.
[02:33:58.802 --> 02:34:01.103]  That's how it started and now we're here.
[02:34:02.484 --> 02:34:08.087]  So if you give an inch, Satan will take a mile.
[02:34:08.107 --> 02:34:14.029]  And this is how everything in society works.
[02:34:14.069 --> 02:34:15.810]  You give an inch, Satan will take a mile.
[02:34:16.263 --> 02:34:19.626]  So the moral standard is God's standard.
[02:34:20.206 --> 02:34:28.893]  People say, oh, you know, is freedom only because of what your beliefs are?
[02:34:28.953 --> 02:34:29.614]  No, no, no.
[02:34:30.455 --> 02:34:31.716]  Here's morality.
[02:34:32.696 --> 02:34:39.462]  Anything that goes past this line of morality, gay marriage, immoral.
[02:34:40.319 --> 02:34:45.542]  But the minute that you're past that line, and I'm going to upset a lot of gay people, I don't hate you.
[02:34:45.562 --> 02:34:46.683]  I don't hate you.
[02:34:47.103 --> 02:34:52.327]  But marriage is a sacred thing given to us by God between a man and a woman.
[02:34:52.547 --> 02:34:53.788]  I don't hate gay people.
[02:34:53.868 --> 02:34:54.668]  I don't hate anyone.
[02:34:54.688 --> 02:34:56.229]  And this is my other problem.
[02:34:56.249 --> 02:35:05.315]  I have so much love in my heart for humanity that it pains me so much to think I can't be around you anymore.
[02:35:07.634 --> 02:35:10.176]  I can't have fellowship with these people!
[02:35:10.197 --> 02:35:11.478]  I can't!
[02:35:12.218 --> 02:35:20.086]  If you think it's right to kill unborn children, if you think it's right to mutilate children's bodies, I cannot sit with you!
[02:35:20.106 --> 02:35:23.990]  And I know that so many feel this way.
[02:35:24.010 --> 02:35:26.832]  The line of morality is here.
[02:35:26.912 --> 02:35:31.657]  As soon as you cross that line, you're no longer in a position to argue morality.
[02:35:33.098 --> 02:35:44.745]  And human beings on their own, because of our susceptibility to sin, are not equipped well enough to decide what is moral and what is not.
[02:35:45.145 --> 02:35:50.208]  If you look at good laws in society, they're based on what was given to us by God.
[02:35:52.310 --> 02:35:55.892]  As human beings, we're too stupid on our own.
[02:35:57.631 --> 02:35:59.732]  And I really, I mean that with all humility.
[02:35:59.992 --> 02:36:07.076]  I am humble enough to know that I am too stupid on my own without the wisdom of God in my life.
[02:36:07.536 --> 02:36:11.378]  But what you're seeing now on your screen is the lack of God.
[02:36:11.658 --> 02:36:16.721]  You are seeing Sodom and Gomorrah 2.0 and this is society today.
[02:36:16.821 --> 02:36:18.882]  Granted, not everyone is like this.
[02:36:19.603 --> 02:36:22.684]  Granted, not everyone thinks that this is okay.
[02:36:22.984 --> 02:36:25.906]  But the majority aren't out there!
[02:36:26.886 --> 02:36:38.915]  At the front of this place, you would think that there would be, you know, tens of thousands of people at this bar where drag queens are dancing naked in front of children protesting, but there wasn't!
[02:36:40.136 --> 02:36:43.939]  There was a handful of people who saw this as wrong.
[02:36:47.161 --> 02:36:51.865]  So how, how can you coexist with these people any longer?
[02:36:53.886 --> 02:37:00.907]   My question is, Is what Jason Whitlock said the only way forward?
[02:37:03.568 --> 02:37:05.149]  I can't see another way.
[02:37:07.010 --> 02:37:17.316]  I mean, I spend so much of my time talking to strangers about the New World Order, about the shots, you know, trying to save their lives so that they don't keep injecting themselves with this poison.
[02:37:17.336 --> 02:37:19.777]  But this is more than just the shots.
[02:37:21.394 --> 02:37:29.698]  This is the religion of science, the religion of self, and it's cloaked in virtue, or a false virtue, I should say.
[02:37:29.718 --> 02:37:33.680]  It's cloaked in inclusivity.
[02:37:35.501 --> 02:37:40.723]  It's cloaked in live and let live, except they don't let you live.
[02:37:43.044 --> 02:37:44.305]  It's not live and let live.
[02:37:45.467 --> 02:37:48.509]  Yet the people that are trapped inside it feel like it is.
[02:37:48.569 --> 02:37:52.291]  They feel like they're being progressive and inclusive, but they're not actually.
[02:37:52.651 --> 02:37:57.154]  Because progressive and inclusive includes all people.
[02:37:58.715 --> 02:38:00.676]  Not just those who think like you.
[02:38:00.696 --> 02:38:08.000]  So the people on our side, on the side of truth, are willing to include all people.
[02:38:08.060 --> 02:38:11.602]  But are we at the point where we say, no, no.
[02:38:14.429 --> 02:38:15.670]  I don't agree with this.
[02:38:16.230 --> 02:38:17.711]  I cannot agree with this.
[02:38:18.932 --> 02:38:23.635]  I cannot take part in this and I don't want to be around you.
[02:38:23.655 --> 02:38:26.877]  I don't want a society where this is happening.
[02:38:28.398 --> 02:38:30.219]  You know, what is the line?
[02:38:30.540 --> 02:38:33.482]  What is the line that people will say, that's it?
[02:38:34.182 --> 02:38:38.129]   Because this Is way past the line!
[02:38:38.229 --> 02:38:48.031]  This is far beyond anything acceptable and normal and I mean you can't possibly be okay with this!
[02:38:48.931 --> 02:38:55.892]  What kind of a sick, demented, demon-possessed person is okay with this?
[02:38:58.233 --> 02:39:00.893]  It makes me sick to my stomach.
[02:39:00.933 --> 02:39:13.591]   You know I heard Savannah Hernandez some time ago I watched a live stream of hers and she was saying, I think she was on Instagram, and she was reporting after she'd been to some of these events.
[02:39:15.051 --> 02:39:21.795]  She said, it actually weighs so heavily on me being at these events to report on them.
[02:39:22.336 --> 02:39:25.577]  She feels the weight of it.
[02:39:25.838 --> 02:39:26.958]  She carries that weight.
[02:39:26.978 --> 02:39:29.159]  It's thick with sickness.
[02:39:31.361 --> 02:39:35.403]  It is thick with the sickness of degeneracy.
[02:39:37.324 --> 02:39:38.744]  And it is contagious.
[02:39:39.125 --> 02:39:45.087]  The sickness of degeneracy is so contagious because live and let live.
[02:39:46.267 --> 02:39:49.208]  You do what you want in your house, I'll do what I want in mine.
[02:39:50.128 --> 02:40:03.032]  Eventually, the degeneracy that you're practicing in your house will spill over into my backyard, will spill over into the rest of the backyard because these people aren't content.
[02:40:03.273 --> 02:40:04.393]  They have no shame.
[02:40:05.319 --> 02:40:07.982]  They aren't content with keeping it inside their house.
[02:40:09.383 --> 02:40:11.926]  They want your children to partake in it.
[02:40:12.347 --> 02:40:21.617]  They want you to, they want to demand your approval of their degeneracy.
[02:40:22.998 --> 02:40:25.321]  They want your approval of their degeneracy.
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:29.662]  I will never approve this.
[02:40:30.483 --> 02:40:36.289]  I cannot approve a man dressing up as a woman, playing dress-ups and calling themselves a woman.
[02:40:36.329 --> 02:40:37.471]  How offensive!
[02:40:37.811 --> 02:40:41.976]  How unbelievably offensive to women is this ridiculousness?
[02:40:42.256 --> 02:40:46.501]  But what they want to do is demoralise us.
[02:40:47.282 --> 02:40:48.844]  No, I'm not demoralised!
[02:40:49.989 --> 02:40:51.050]  New World Order goons.
[02:40:51.130 --> 02:40:52.350]  I'm not demoralised.
[02:40:52.911 --> 02:41:00.875]  I'm talking about, here's a time for people to actually say no, we need some other type of solution.
[02:41:01.255 --> 02:41:07.318]  And I want to go into that right after this break, some of what that other type of solution might look like.
[02:41:08.619 --> 02:41:13.702]  What sorts of things we could potentially do with this concept of cessation.
[02:41:14.462 --> 02:41:15.523]  I'll see you right after the break.
[02:41:16.331 --> 02:41:24.054]  You know, InfoWars and independent media is so critical at this point to keep these people honest to some level.
[02:41:24.555 --> 02:41:26.435]  And I'm not talking about giving up here.
[02:41:26.455 --> 02:41:33.038]  I'm talking about building better than they build, if I can use those words.
[02:41:34.199 --> 02:41:35.980]  Building on righteous values.
[02:41:37.420 --> 02:41:39.021]  Gathering the lions.
[02:41:40.293 --> 02:41:48.416]  You know, if you want to go and be eaten by the wolves of the New World Order, you can go and be eaten by the wolves of the New World Order.
[02:41:48.656 --> 02:42:01.280]  Us, the lions, are going to be here building something that can actually last because the society that they want is going to crumble.
[02:42:02.081 --> 02:42:02.721]  It's filth.
[02:42:04.251 --> 02:42:06.674]  It has no strong foundation.
[02:42:07.095 --> 02:42:10.378]  You can't build a foundation on lies.
[02:42:10.578 --> 02:42:11.419]  It will collapse.
[02:42:13.742 --> 02:42:25.295]  Now, I'm not so naive to think that we on the side of truth haven't been tricked into segregating ourselves in this way, you know, with the echo chambers that they created.
[02:42:26.644 --> 02:42:31.705]  Where you weren't able to have a voice in the public square on social media, for example, with censorship.
[02:42:31.745 --> 02:42:33.706]  That being one way that they've created echo chambers.
[02:42:33.726 --> 02:42:43.929]  So I'm not so naive to think that perhaps we haven't been tricked into wanting a solution like secession or a national divorce.
[02:42:43.949 --> 02:42:49.130]  And I'm not saying that's the only way, but I'm asking the question, is it the only way?
[02:42:51.511 --> 02:42:55.352]  If it was the way forward, what would it look like?
[02:42:56.417 --> 02:43:02.240]  Because we already have the divide in society happening, like I said earlier, with Bud Light.
[02:43:04.322 --> 02:43:06.583]  People immediately boycotted.
[02:43:07.203 --> 02:43:09.485]  They've lost something like $4 billion, I think.
[02:43:10.525 --> 02:43:11.926]  Immediate boycott.
[02:43:13.327 --> 02:43:16.729]  And people refusing to accept their products in their stores.
[02:43:17.930 --> 02:43:18.250]  Okay.
[02:43:19.019 --> 02:43:22.941]  What'll happen is there'll be a patriot-loving brand that takes its place.
[02:43:23.762 --> 02:43:38.671]  Every time a company does some gross, woke crap like that, it's a perfect opportunity for a freedom-loving business to come in and say, we're going to do it this way.
[02:43:39.696 --> 02:43:42.078]  We're going to support farmers.
[02:43:42.778 --> 02:43:53.366]  We've just here in Australia partnered with a business that guarantees mRNA-free meat and the Aussies are flocking to support the Aussie farmers.
[02:43:54.607 --> 02:44:07.480]   I mean, we are in a really great position to create a parallel economy with people who say, no, I will not I will not bow down to this agenda.
[02:44:07.740 --> 02:44:09.180]  I will not do this.
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:37.794]   I want nothing to do with this and we're going to pull our brains, our thinking, our commitment to righteousness, our funds, our support, our love, all of the things that make a society wonderful, we're going to pull that together and combat this thing together because the only way to do it Is with information, with our support of one another, with our communities, with our wallets.
[02:44:40.515 --> 02:44:41.435]  Screw you!
[02:44:41.875 --> 02:44:43.075]  Go woke, go broke.
[02:44:43.455 --> 02:44:44.536]  We're going this way.
[02:44:45.936 --> 02:44:54.019]  And you know, maybe those that think like we do, but are too afraid to speak, will finally have courage when they see the strength.
[02:44:54.119 --> 02:44:58.020]  Because right now it appears that the world system is the only thing that has strength.
[02:44:58.480 --> 02:44:59.360]  That is hogwash.
[02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:01.321]  That is absolute hogwash.
[02:45:02.290 --> 02:45:06.671]  And it's not the only way to build an economy, a parallel economy.
[02:45:06.751 --> 02:45:15.872]  You know, I'm all for gold and silver and I'm all for, you know, bartering and trading and having food and, you know, all of these resources to prepare for what's coming.
[02:45:15.912 --> 02:45:16.913]  I'm all for that.
[02:45:17.173 --> 02:45:19.173]  But that's not the only way out.
[02:45:20.033 --> 02:45:24.294]  We can't let them trap us into thinking that's the only way out.
[02:45:26.174 --> 02:45:27.094]  So what would it look like?
[02:45:27.134 --> 02:45:29.175]  Would it look like certain countries?
[02:45:29.635 --> 02:45:30.735]  If you believe in this?
[02:45:32.051 --> 02:45:33.272]  You can move to this country.
[02:45:33.312 --> 02:45:34.333]  This is what they stand for.
[02:45:34.353 --> 02:45:36.374]  Would it look like certain states?
[02:45:38.656 --> 02:45:47.342]  Would it look like... And this is where I say, have we been tricked into this?
[02:45:47.362 --> 02:45:49.544]  Would it look like certain regions?
[02:45:51.405 --> 02:45:53.307]  You know, how long did we fight?
[02:45:54.968 --> 02:45:57.290]  Did the world fight to pull down the Berlin Wall?
[02:45:57.350 --> 02:46:00.332]  And now we're in a position where we're saying, maybe we need a wall!
[02:46:01.647 --> 02:46:07.691]  And I'm not talking about a wall for the border, but in a way I kind of am.
[02:46:07.711 --> 02:46:10.733]  I mean, I'm just spitballing here.
[02:46:10.773 --> 02:46:15.536]  I'm throwing ideas out there because I want the New World Order to understand.
[02:46:16.577 --> 02:46:18.618]  We are not taking part in this.
[02:46:18.698 --> 02:46:23.841]  The agenda is coming thick and fast and hard and hammers us every day of the week.
[02:46:24.042 --> 02:46:24.822]  There's something new.
[02:46:25.042 --> 02:46:25.983]  Owen talks about it.
[02:46:26.855 --> 02:46:32.719]  There's too much to cover in these several hours that I'm here.
[02:46:34.980 --> 02:46:38.382]  We can talk about the agenda 24 hours a day.
[02:46:38.503 --> 02:46:39.523]  Sometimes I do.
[02:46:41.484 --> 02:46:45.707]  So, you know, they want us to feel overwhelmed.
[02:46:45.747 --> 02:46:46.848]  We're not overwhelmed.
[02:46:47.702 --> 02:46:49.944]  We just understand that you are evil.
[02:46:50.024 --> 02:46:56.248]  I'm not going to waste my time arguing statistics and trying to prove how you're lying anymore.
[02:46:56.528 --> 02:46:57.689]  You are a liar.
[02:46:59.230 --> 02:47:00.270]  You are evil.
[02:47:00.651 --> 02:47:03.973]  You have partaken in a depopulation agenda.
[02:47:04.293 --> 02:47:07.555]  You are still partaking in a depopulation agenda.
[02:47:07.915 --> 02:47:09.857]  You want to mutilate children.
[02:47:11.278 --> 02:47:13.199]  You are a child mutilator.
[02:47:14.858 --> 02:47:20.223]  I want nothing to do with you, and I know that there are people that agree with me.
[02:47:20.944 --> 02:47:21.304]  Many.
[02:47:22.685 --> 02:47:23.806]  Many, many people.
[02:47:25.228 --> 02:47:29.051]  Millions, in fact, when there are about this many of you.
[02:47:29.071 --> 02:47:30.753]  You losers.
[02:47:30.773 --> 02:47:34.937]  I'm talking about those self-proclaimed elites.
[02:47:38.331 --> 02:47:40.935]  So the solution really is, it's here.
[02:47:41.115 --> 02:47:42.998]  It's within our reach.
[02:47:43.539 --> 02:47:46.883]  You see the response of the world to something like Bud Light.
[02:47:47.184 --> 02:47:48.966]  You see the response of the world.
[02:47:49.027 --> 02:47:52.331]  I think Dylan Mulvaney is now promoting Nike.
[02:47:53.793 --> 02:47:59.936]  Just for everyone that, you know, that wants to continue supporting only brands.
[02:48:00.537 --> 02:48:02.938]  Bonds is now promoting gender free.
[02:48:02.998 --> 02:48:05.719]  So, you know, be mindful with your purchases.
[02:48:06.319 --> 02:48:12.883]  I am purposely now at the point where I am checking every brand and what they stand for.
[02:48:13.183 --> 02:48:21.327]  And if it means I never buy a piece of clothing again and I go to, you know, someone to sew my stuff, maybe I'll do that.
[02:48:22.893 --> 02:48:27.754]  Maybe I will go to the freedom-loving woman down the road.
[02:48:31.095 --> 02:48:38.416]  I know that in the United States, you guys organize yourselves a lot better than us when it comes to freedom-loving businesses and supporting one another.
[02:48:38.536 --> 02:48:41.077]  I really think every single country needs to do that.
[02:48:41.457 --> 02:48:45.078]  We are so much stronger than these people.
[02:48:45.818 --> 02:48:51.899]  And I don't mean physically, although often that's the case because we're not, you know, full of soy boys and stuff like that.
[02:48:52.714 --> 02:48:58.597]  And men that dance around in high heels and women's shorts, skirts.
[02:48:59.937 --> 02:49:01.718]  We are stronger in courage.
[02:49:01.778 --> 02:49:03.118]  We are stronger in heart.
[02:49:03.399 --> 02:49:05.179]  We are stronger in perseverance.
[02:49:05.399 --> 02:49:07.941]  We don't cry when someone offends us.
[02:49:09.261 --> 02:49:15.724]  We don't cry when someone threatens our worldview because we're actually securing it because it's not built on lies!
[02:49:17.173 --> 02:49:24.335]  We are so much stronger than these people in character, in heart, in mental fortitude, for goodness sake.
[02:49:26.995 --> 02:49:31.816]  And we're going to be defeated by this satanic agenda?
[02:49:32.956 --> 02:49:33.877]  No, we're not.
[02:49:34.177 --> 02:49:37.497]  Because we know that sin is at the door.
[02:49:37.797 --> 02:49:40.238]  We know that it's crouching.
[02:49:42.236 --> 02:49:47.098]  And if we do not do what is right, sin is there waiting for the first opportunity and we avoid it.
[02:49:48.739 --> 02:49:52.040]  We can recognize that our conscience is not seared.
[02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:54.261]  We want to do what's right.
[02:49:54.841 --> 02:50:09.868]  And I promise you, I promise you, that when people see the strength of what the people on the right side of truth are capable of, all of a sudden it will start to look more appealing than child mutilation.
[02:50:11.425 --> 02:50:17.951]  All of a sudden it will start to look more appealing than watching Rihanna at the Super Bowl give homage to Satan.
[02:50:19.933 --> 02:50:36.529]  All of a sudden, seeing a family that's fruitful and has children and has provision and isn't bound by the chains of the corporate takeover, but can grow their own food, starts to look really appealing.
[02:50:40.069 --> 02:50:43.211]  So I really just want to encourage people to think about this.
[02:50:43.292 --> 02:50:44.032]  How would it look?
[02:50:46.194 --> 02:50:47.074]  Who can start it?
[02:50:47.094 --> 02:50:50.437]  I mean, we're already starting it.
[02:50:50.477 --> 02:50:57.182]  We're already starting it by listening to this broadcast and by being our own leaders in our own lives.
[02:50:58.083 --> 02:51:01.306]  I say to everyone, don't believe the information that I give you.
[02:51:01.366 --> 02:51:03.147]  Don't, don't believe a word I say.
[02:51:03.547 --> 02:51:06.089]  Take it in, go and research it for yourself.
[02:51:06.129 --> 02:51:07.010]  Make up your own mind.
[02:51:08.444 --> 02:51:10.945]  This is the empowerment that the right has.
[02:51:12.666 --> 02:51:14.206]  We are free thinking people.
[02:51:14.246 --> 02:51:19.449]  We are powerful people because our hearts are not ash.
[02:51:22.350 --> 02:51:24.551]  We have a living beating heart.
[02:51:26.492 --> 02:51:30.033]  With most of the time pure blood running through our veins.
[02:51:32.514 --> 02:51:36.236]  Let's not forget that and let's never let these people weigh us down.
[02:51:37.037 --> 02:51:38.921]  And we keep moving forward.
[02:51:38.941 --> 02:51:39.602]  God bless you all.
[02:51:39.642 --> 02:51:42.027]  Thank you so much for joining me today.
[02:51:42.047 --> 02:51:44.652]  Stay tuned for Owen Schreier coming up next.
[02:51:45.012 --> 02:51:47.331]  And thank you so much to InfoWars and the crew.
[02:51:47.331 --> 02:52:00.851]  [Music]
[02:52:00.851 --> 02:52:05.571]   When I sit here and hammer and beg and plead on air, promoting great products that you already need that are
[02:52:05.571 --> 02:52:08.492]   amazing, we're able to be in the black.
[02:52:08.481 --> 02:52:17.723]  You probably noticed the last three weeks I've barely plugged, I haven't hammered things, because I don't like coming up here, I want to cover news and information, and just begging and pleading and explaining.
[02:52:18.203 --> 02:52:32.067]   We did the accounting yesterday, we're back in the red, we've just gotten out of it, and I guess this is where God wants to keep me, it's all in God's plan I'm sure, but you need these products anyways, these are great products that are life-changing, And we won't be here if you don't support us.
[02:52:32.107 --> 02:52:34.748]  So Trump has a war chest of 400 million dollars.
[02:52:34.768 --> 02:52:35.248]  That's great.
[02:52:35.368 --> 02:52:36.048]  He deserves it.
[02:52:36.228 --> 02:52:36.669]  Wonderful.
[02:52:37.129 --> 02:52:38.069]  Everybody's supporting Trump.
[02:52:38.649 --> 02:52:40.430]  We don't have a war chest of a million dollars.
[02:52:41.290 --> 02:52:42.691]  So we need to be able to stay on air.
[02:52:43.973 --> 02:52:45.073]  Bankruptcy is going well.
[02:52:45.133 --> 02:52:46.394]  They found out we're not hiding money.
[02:52:46.414 --> 02:52:47.774]  They found out I've told the truth about everything.
[02:52:48.254 --> 02:52:51.615]  The reorganization is going well, but not if there's not enough money to fund the operation.
[02:52:52.015 --> 02:52:53.756]  So you need ultimate krill oil.
[02:52:54.056 --> 02:53:00.938]  Highest quality, highest grade krill oil that does over-the-top things for your cardiovascular system, your brain, your mind, your psyche.
[02:53:02.018 --> 02:53:02.639]  It's next level.
[02:53:02.999 --> 02:53:04.200]  We have great fish oil as well.
[02:53:04.260 --> 02:53:05.200]  Those are 40% off.
[02:53:05.481 --> 02:53:11.044]  We're selling out of the great idea my dad had, the turmeric, a non-fluoride toothpaste with all the essential oils.

[02:53:23.206 --> 02:53:24.186]  But we need the funds down.

[02:53:59.746 --> 02:54:01.127]  Also, the Trump mugshot.
[02:54:01.408 --> 02:54:04.772]  They never get a real mugshot, so we already have created one.
[02:54:04.832 --> 02:54:05.753]  It's being printed right now.
[02:54:05.773 --> 02:54:06.714]  It'll be shipping out next week.
[02:54:07.699 --> 02:54:13.664]  Says political prisoner with a picture of Trump in a basically a lineup or a mugshot on the back.
[02:54:13.824 --> 02:54:15.645]  Infowars.com.

[02:54:26.194 --> 02:54:27.295]  I want to encourage those on the fence.
[02:54:27.715 --> 02:54:28.736]  The fight's now, folks.
[02:54:29.056 --> 02:54:29.957]  We're the tip of the spear.
[02:54:29.977 --> 02:54:30.858]  You're the tip of the spear.
[02:54:31.358 --> 02:54:32.299]  Please get off the bench.
[02:54:32.819 --> 02:54:35.704]  Especially those of you, because I know 99% of our audience never buys anything.
[02:54:36.165 --> 02:54:37.226]  Just go to In-Footwear Store.
[02:54:37.567 --> 02:54:38.328]  I'm in your hands.
[02:54:38.428 --> 02:54:39.190]  You're in my hands.
[02:54:39.610 --> 02:54:40.532]  Realize you're in a fight.
[02:54:40.832 --> 02:54:41.413]  Fund the fight.
[02:54:41.593 --> 02:54:42.475]  Or roll over and die.
[02:54:42.295 --> 02:54:55.894]  I appreciate your support.
[02:54:55.908 --> 02:55:05.031]  It doesn't matter how discredited or debunked any of their narratives get, they will always return to them as if no one has ever raised the question.
[02:55:05.111 --> 02:55:05.951]  I'll give you an example.
[02:55:06.392 --> 02:55:10.793]  COVID-19 vaccination, Alex, absolutely effective and perfectly safe.
[02:55:11.313 --> 02:55:18.116]  They're just ignoring the mountain of information now that disproves that as if we haven't heard it, as if it's not true.
[02:55:18.897 --> 02:55:23.820]  They always return to their same fake narrative, and they double down.
[02:55:24.180 --> 02:55:32.326]  And when you have a near monopoly on the output of information, as they have had until recently, it makes it a lot easier.
[02:55:33.146 --> 02:55:39.250]  They decided to not perp-walk him, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[02:55:39.811 --> 02:55:41.051]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[02:55:41.732 --> 02:55:43.213]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[02:55:43.253 --> 02:55:45.594]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[02:55:46.035 --> 02:55:48.056]  And it says, political prisoner.
[02:55:48.823 --> 02:55:50.603]  With an image of President Trump.
[02:55:50.803 --> 02:55:52.884]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[02:55:53.244 --> 02:55:55.145]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[02:55:55.365 --> 02:56:01.626]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[02:56:01.966 --> 02:56:02.986]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[02:56:03.006 --> 02:56:06.987]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[02:56:07.127 --> 02:56:08.688]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[02:56:08.748 --> 02:56:09.708]  No, I'm not running for president.
[02:56:09.768 --> 02:56:12.028]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[02:56:12.309 --> 02:56:12.989]  Red, white, and blue.
[02:56:13.089 --> 02:56:13.969]  Alex Jones for president.
[02:56:14.669 --> 02:56:17.490]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited-edition shirt.
[02:56:17.510 --> 02:56:19.350]  Great way to fund the operation.
[02:56:19.410 --> 02:56:28.653]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:56:33.260 --> 02:56:34.080]  And two other things.
[02:56:34.261 --> 02:56:35.401]  We're selling out of DNA Force.
[02:56:35.441 --> 02:56:36.502]  Won't get more for three or four months.
[02:56:36.522 --> 02:56:37.462]  It's an amazing product.
[02:56:37.762 --> 02:56:39.503]  We're selling out of Real Red Pill, an incredible product.
[02:56:39.783 --> 02:56:40.924]  Despite that, we need the funds.
[02:56:41.284 --> 02:56:43.846]  They're both 40% off, despite the fact they're selling out.
[02:56:44.186 --> 02:56:46.007]  Check those products out at InfoWarshaw.com.
