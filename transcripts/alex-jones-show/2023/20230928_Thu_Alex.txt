[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.832]  They're saying they're not going to even let RFK on the ballot in New Hampshire and Iowa because he campaigned there.
[00:00:05.032 --> 00:00:06.934]  Their rules say you can't campaign.
[00:00:07.034 --> 00:00:07.254]  What?
[00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:09.715]  They're new rules.
[00:00:11.737 --> 00:00:17.821]  So they're tailoring everything for Joe Biden and his second basement candidacy if he refuses to step down.
[00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:22.564]  That's why they're allowing the corporate media to now attack Biden.
[00:00:22.644 --> 00:00:23.705]  He's fair game.
[00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:30.635]   Now they've indicted his son on a whitewash charge, but still they're beginning to apply The pressure.
[00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:33.339]  And of course, the big news all over the place.
[00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.781]  Trump found guilty!
[00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:36.643]  Ding dong, the witch is dead.
[00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:37.564]  The witch, oh witch.
[00:00:37.644 --> 00:00:38.405]  The witch, oh witch.
[00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.789]  Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead.
[00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:41.530]  That's what they're saying.
[00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.193]  And they're like, he'll have his hotels taken.
[00:00:44.213 --> 00:00:46.476]  He'll have his golf courses taken, the judge says.
[00:00:47.017 --> 00:00:59.545]  The judge found him guilty of saying Mar-a-Lago was worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and the judge says it's worth $18 million, even though the tax rolls say it's worth way more, and people are ready to buy it for $300 million today.
[00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:01.106]  It's not worth that.
[00:01:01.346 --> 00:01:12.012]  And if they say he exaggerated the worth of something in some financial statement, why, it just says in the headlines, Trump's set to lose everything!
[00:01:12.032 --> 00:01:14.634]  Like, how does that happen?
[00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:16.315]  Well, a judge defaults you.
[00:01:17.332 --> 00:01:18.293]  That's what he did.
[00:01:19.293 --> 00:01:28.540]  The judge finds you guilty, then has a civil trial, where they only put on their evidence, and then the jury comes back and says, we find him guilty, three million dollars.
[00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:35.269]   And unlike me not having a million dollars with their fake, you know, garbage, Trump's got it and then they start
[00:01:35.269 --> 00:01:36.819]  taking his stuff.
[00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:46.819]  [Music]
[00:01:46.491 --> 00:02:07.304]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:02:07.424 --> 00:02:08.225]  InfoWars.
[00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:10.066]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:13.462]  We don't make this stuff up.
[00:02:13.662 --> 00:02:14.842]  Believe me, I wish we were.
[00:02:15.062 --> 00:02:15.723]  Believe me.
[00:02:15.903 --> 00:02:16.743]  Believe me!
[00:02:16.983 --> 00:02:17.584]  Believe it!
[00:02:17.624 --> 00:02:23.467]  But when I get this info, I'm gonna tell ya, no matter what happens, you can be guaranteed of that!
[00:02:24.247 --> 00:02:28.109]  No matter what happens, I will go 100%, period!
[00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:28.949]  And that's it!
[00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.790]  Excuse me.
[00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.432]  The reason I started yelling, folks, is this is life and death stuff, okay?
[00:02:33.972 --> 00:02:40.197]  And my adrenaline just goes crazy, because at a subconscious level, I realize this is combat, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:40.217 --> 00:02:43.439]  This is, this is, this is not a joke, this is not a game.
[00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.500]  It's not good to serve evil.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:58.329]  All these globalists look like reanimated corpses, and they all just get off on destruction and power, and their empire's collapsing, sucking America down with it, and they're not gonna let it collapse without starting World War III!
[00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.050]  That's what all this is about!

[00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.471]  Okay, I don't know what... Whatever it is, it's not right on the teleprompter.
[00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:52.371]  I don't know what that is.
[00:04:52.431 --> 00:04:53.272]  I've never seen that.
[00:04:53.772 --> 00:04:55.392]  We are gonna do InfoWars.
[00:04:55.832 --> 00:04:56.072]  Yeah.
[00:04:56.232 --> 00:05:00.013]  Okay, but... Now, I can't read it.
[00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:01.474]  There's no words on it.
[00:05:01.974 --> 00:05:02.294]  Okay.
[00:05:03.014 --> 00:05:03.354]  Ready?
[00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:05.915]  There's no words there!
[00:05:06.095 --> 00:05:07.015]  To play us out!
[00:05:07.816 --> 00:05:08.376]  What does that mean?
[00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:09.216]  To play us out.
[00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:13.452]  Alex Jones is gonna do a new broadcast.
[00:05:13.532 --> 00:05:17.013]  Alright, go, go!
[00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:24.255]  That's tomorrow, and that is it for us today, and we will leave you with a... I can't do it!
[00:05:25.656 --> 00:05:26.296]  We'll do it live!
[00:05:28.359 --> 00:05:29.360]  Well, do it live!
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.841]  Fuck it!
[00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:30.802]  Do it live!

[00:05:42.355 --> 00:05:49.662]   On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[00:05:49.862 --> 00:06:00.151]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[00:06:00.952 --> 00:06:07.037]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.032]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:06:17.112 --> 00:06:22.537]  The truth is out there in front of you, but they lay off this buffet of lies!
[00:06:22.837 --> 00:06:26.880]  I'm sick of it, and I'm not gonna take a bite out of it!
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.201]  See, you got me?
[00:06:28.342 --> 00:06:30.303]  I'm here to warn people.
[00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:32.845]  You keep telling me to shut up.
[00:06:32.865 --> 00:06:34.647]  This isn't a game.
[00:06:35.388 --> 00:06:39.011]  Visit infowars.com forward slash show today.
[00:06:41.618 --> 00:06:45.241]  We're going to break and we're coming back with some big surprises today.
[00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:46.081]  Believe it.
[00:06:47.042 --> 00:06:52.486]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Thursday, September 28th, 2023.
[00:06:53.427 --> 00:07:00.847]   I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be Live for the next four hours ahead of The War Room.
[00:07:01.827 --> 00:07:03.648]  Owen Schroer, the host of The War Room, isn't here.
[00:07:03.688 --> 00:07:04.869]  He's going back to St.
[00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:14.253]  Louis, Missouri to spend a week of well-deserved time with his family before he's put in federal prison for peacefully trying to stop people going into the Capitol.
[00:07:15.274 --> 00:07:24.979]  Speaking of that, new video has emerged of Ray Epps commanding the second breach, not just the first breach, but the second breach into the Capitol.
[00:07:26.283 --> 00:07:34.447]  Of course, he's just been charged with a misdemeanor because of massive pressure and people pointing out that he appeared to be above the law.
[00:07:37.528 --> 00:07:40.209]  Obviously, we're going to talk some about the so-called Republican debate.
[00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:41.690]  Last night, I watched almost all of it.
[00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:56.952]   I also covered it live on air with Steven Crowder and his crew and They said a lot of good things about families and the attacks on families and securing the border.
[00:07:57.592 --> 00:08:02.173]  But a lot of bad things were said, like, hey, let's, you know, fight the Russians over there so we don't fight them over here.
[00:08:03.113 --> 00:08:06.734]  And garbage like that, they all ganged up, or most of them ganged up on Trump.
[00:08:07.234 --> 00:08:08.094]  Ramaswamy didn't.
[00:08:08.735 --> 00:08:19.677]  It was something else, and it gave a lot of fodder, obviously, to the Biden campaign, who's already using clips of the Santas and others attacking Trump, and ads they're flooding television and the Internet with right now.
[00:08:21.957 --> 00:08:26.498]  But the big takeaways for me were the fact that no one's discussing there aren't going to be Democrat Party debates.
[00:08:27.458 --> 00:08:33.140]  That's the level of election control and fraud the deep state is showing up with O'Biden.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.140]  And they are getting Big Mike ready.
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.841]  Roger Stone's been proven correct.
[00:08:36.961 --> 00:08:37.841]  I thought it would be Newsom.
[00:08:37.861 --> 00:08:39.021]  They've got him waiting in the wings.
[00:08:39.941 --> 00:08:42.082]  So I think it will be a combination, Newsom, Big Mike.
[00:08:43.254 --> 00:08:46.137]  But we're going to find out very, very soon.
[00:08:46.197 --> 00:08:51.543]  But the inside baseball we've known for a while is they've been trying to get Biden to step down for a year.
[00:08:51.643 --> 00:08:52.404]  He won't do it.
[00:08:54.366 --> 00:08:56.168]  To call Biden the puppet's not really accurate.
[00:08:56.188 --> 00:09:03.737]  He's more like a placeholder, a very corrupt individual, obviously, and a pervert and a congenital liar, as we all know.
[00:09:04.901 --> 00:09:12.187]  He and his wife do like the power and the prestige and all the money they can squeeze out of people with bribes.
[00:09:13.128 --> 00:09:14.769]  And so this is going to be very, very interesting.
[00:09:14.809 --> 00:09:21.335]  But I really think there's a good chance they're going to bust a cap at old Joe, old Corn Pop.
[00:09:21.935 --> 00:09:23.016]  Going to bust a cap at him.
[00:09:23.056 --> 00:09:23.997]  I hope that doesn't happen.
[00:09:24.477 --> 00:09:25.418]  We stand against that.
[00:09:26.058 --> 00:09:26.899]  Turn him into a martyr.
[00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:28.500]  Plus he again is just a placeholder.
[00:09:29.381 --> 00:09:31.062]  But I see that in the cards.
[00:09:31.883 --> 00:09:33.604]  Also, they're all over the news.
[00:09:33.944 --> 00:09:43.632]  General Milley was trending at the top of Twitter last night, going on 60 Minutes and saying, oh, how dare Trump imply that he should be charged with treason.
[00:09:47.194 --> 00:09:49.856]  For saying, don't worry, I've got the nuclear codes, not Trump.
[00:09:49.976 --> 00:09:54.720]  He said that to folks and calling up the head of the Communist Chinese military.
[00:09:56.345 --> 00:09:59.048]  And saying, don't worry, I'm in command, not Trump.
[00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.092]  That is completely illegal.
[00:10:03.193 --> 00:10:12.043]  And his disgusting response about, I don't care if Trump wants me dead, which isn't what Trump said, because I'm an American patriot and I'll do anything for my country.
[00:10:12.083 --> 00:10:15.747]  And how dare him attack the entire armed services by attacking me?
[00:10:16.738 --> 00:10:24.209]  There's basic sophomore level psychology, very sophomoric, but that's what this traitor does.
[00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:26.913]  This guy has presided over the destruction of the U.S.
[00:10:26.953 --> 00:10:32.342]  military, the purge of the military, the poison shots of the military that Trump opposed.
[00:10:34.304 --> 00:10:38.304]   He opposed making him forced. I'm not saying Trump's perfect in the matter, far from it.
[00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:44.784]   But compared to this guy, he's certainly a lot better. And then I just remembered
[00:10:44.784 --> 00:10:49.823]   when I saw these clips last night that were going viral of Millie and his minions,
[00:10:49.823 --> 00:10:54.304]   "Oh, he wants to kill me," and all this. Just yesterday, I played a compilation
[00:10:54.304 --> 00:10:59.745]   from three years ago when Trump was still in office before they stole the election.
[00:11:00.015 --> 00:11:07.958]  And we have five minute clips and three minute clips and two minute clips of just solid people saying, the deep state's going to kill this guy.
[00:11:08.378 --> 00:11:09.419]  We're going to kill this guy.
[00:11:10.439 --> 00:11:11.760]  Trump's guilty of treason.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.161]  He's a Russian agent, which of course is totally fake.
[00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:18.923]  And the charge for treason is death.
[00:11:18.983 --> 00:11:22.756]   That's the only Consequence is death.
[00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:24.777]  It's the only thing in the law, it's death.
[00:11:25.157 --> 00:11:26.458]  So Trump needs to die.
[00:11:27.218 --> 00:11:27.918]  You all heard it.
[00:11:28.239 --> 00:11:29.179]  You need me to play it again.
[00:11:29.619 --> 00:11:32.140]  Everybody remembers him doing it at nauseam.
[00:11:34.521 --> 00:11:50.525]   But what I'm going to do is, I haven't asked yet, I'm going to ask McBreen or one of our other great editors to grab, and we already have the reports on the computer, And just cut out the parts where they say the deep state's gonna kill this guy, the deep state's gonna get this guy, the only penalty for treason is death.
[00:11:50.705 --> 00:11:53.847]  This is Democrat lawmakers on TV and pundits.
[00:11:54.508 --> 00:11:59.772]  And then cut to Milley saying it's so terrible that Trump said that I'm guilty of treason.
[00:12:01.834 --> 00:12:02.514]  And that's what he said.
[00:12:03.795 --> 00:12:04.776]  And of course it's true.
[00:12:05.276 --> 00:12:06.717]  General Milley was not elected.
[00:12:07.718 --> 00:12:09.620]  General Milley is not the commander-in-chief.
[00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:21.527]  General Milley is a race-baiting, critical race theory, transgender-promoting, force-injection-promoting, training the military for war of the American people.
[00:12:23.249 --> 00:12:27.131]  He helped get the military to refuse Trump, and Trump could have overrid him, but he didn't.
[00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:31.053]  Putting 10,000 National Guard on the streets for January 6th.
[00:12:31.714 --> 00:12:33.795]  He is complicit in all of this.
[00:12:34.816 --> 00:12:36.697]  If you really want to look at a failing, it's Trump.
[00:12:37.927 --> 00:12:48.275]  Because the military, the people who control it, and people like Milley keep putting the story out that Trump hates the military, and Trump hates the troops, and Trump hates senseless war and people getting hurt for no reason.
[00:12:49.316 --> 00:12:51.598]  So they put that talking point out that Trump hates the military.
[00:12:51.878 --> 00:12:54.280]  No, we all know who hates the military.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.141]  And I know Trump pretty well.
[00:12:56.161 --> 00:12:57.222]  I know people that know him really well.
[00:12:57.282 --> 00:13:10.010]   He has a very delusional, I'm being honest, being nice here, but it's the truth, It's almost sycophantic worship of the military he got from his dad.
[00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.231]  He was also in a military academy.
[00:13:13.032 --> 00:13:15.454]  That they're the best Americans and they're John Wayne at the top.
[00:13:15.974 --> 00:13:19.517]  He was naive like most Americans are that the top of the military has been seized by the globalists.
[00:13:19.858 --> 00:13:21.199]  Our military knows it better than anybody.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.461]  They're great people on average, some of the best out there.
[00:13:25.282 --> 00:13:27.984]  And nobody's taken away from their service, even though sometimes it's been misdirected.
[00:13:28.004 --> 00:13:28.725]  We appreciate you.
[00:13:29.285 --> 00:13:32.268]  But the people claiming they represent America in all this are garbage.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.331]  And Trump has said this now.
[00:13:36.653 --> 00:13:42.698]  He says, I'm not naive anymore, I know how Washington works, I know who controls the major agencies, including the Pentagon now.
[00:13:42.718 --> 00:13:48.022]  I mean, Eisenhower was the former Supreme Allied Commander and he warned you about the people getting control of the military.
[00:13:48.042 --> 00:13:52.465]  In 1961, his farewell address, he wasn't anti-America, he wasn't anti-military.
[00:13:52.845 --> 00:14:07.837]   Anybody that knows history knows, look at Rome, look at Venezuela, look at Nazi Germany, look at... You better have control of your military and you better have people in there that are loyal to the Constitution and Their oath and understand that they should not follow illegal orders.
[00:14:10.339 --> 00:14:15.643]  But instead we have the Border Patrol videos where they're telling them, we don't like bringing in pedophiles and letting them go.
[00:14:15.683 --> 00:14:16.203]  We don't like it.
[00:14:16.444 --> 00:14:18.785]  Well, it's your order just to follow the law.
[00:14:18.845 --> 00:14:21.548]  The law says and Biden says you bring them in and you turn them loose.
[00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.191]  So they use this over and over and over and over again.
[00:14:26.211 --> 00:14:27.973]  So we're going to be laying all of that out today.
[00:14:28.053 --> 00:14:31.375]  Also ABC News reporter who debunked Pizzagate.
[00:14:32.301 --> 00:14:34.222]  Faces life in prison for child rapes.
[00:14:35.323 --> 00:14:37.764]  And then, something really interesting and informative.
[00:14:39.665 --> 00:14:44.668]  Craig Jones is arguably the top MMA grappler in the world.
[00:14:45.308 --> 00:14:46.088]  Lives here in Austin.
[00:14:46.128 --> 00:14:47.049]  He's an Australian.
[00:14:47.089 --> 00:14:47.729]  I've got to know him.
[00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:48.450]  He's a friend of mine.
[00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.010]  Really smart, funny guy.
[00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.211]  Joe Rogan and I have gone out and seen some of his matches together.
[00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:54.293]  And he's lived here now three years.
[00:14:54.873 --> 00:14:55.773]  He's been on the show a few times.
[00:14:55.793 --> 00:14:56.434]  I've been on his show.
[00:14:56.474 --> 00:14:57.314]  He was here yesterday.
[00:14:57.334 --> 00:14:58.715]  I'll skip this break.
[00:14:59.675 --> 00:15:00.376]  And, uh...
[00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:06.693]  We were talking about the time that Eddie Bravo was going to choke me out like five, six years ago on a Joe Rogan's podcast.
[00:15:07.133 --> 00:15:08.954]  And Joe said, no, Eddie, don't do it.
[00:15:09.994 --> 00:15:12.115]  And I said, I haven't been choked out since high school.
[00:15:13.356 --> 00:15:14.736]  My dad choked me out once, too.
[00:15:15.436 --> 00:15:18.278]  Hey, I was like 13 years old, really aggressive at 13.
[00:15:19.238 --> 00:15:28.027]   Started talking back, turned the kitchen table over and My mom jumped up, got in my face, and I pushed her.
[00:15:28.407 --> 00:15:28.667]  Boom.
[00:15:28.827 --> 00:15:29.267]  Lights out.
[00:15:29.707 --> 00:15:30.248]  Choked me out.
[00:15:30.708 --> 00:15:31.888]  My dad did a little too hard, too.
[00:15:31.948 --> 00:15:33.329]  Broke blood vessels in my eyes.
[00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:36.430]  The point was, I was really tough for 13.
[00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:40.531]  So I don't blame him for getting me out as fast as he could, because I had a really bad temper.
[00:15:40.872 --> 00:15:44.253]  I said, I haven't been choked out since high school.
[00:15:45.576 --> 00:15:49.859]  And because I got choked out by somebody else one time and he said, here, I'll do it.
[00:15:50.519 --> 00:15:52.621]  And man choked me out in like two seconds.
[00:15:52.681 --> 00:15:54.142]  So that hasn't aired yet.
[00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:59.185]  He was taping for his podcast and it's not some geeking thing we're doing, you know, just reviews.
[00:15:59.606 --> 00:16:03.748]  It's very illustrative of how quick death could come or how easy we can die and what it was like.
[00:16:03.768 --> 00:16:07.391]  Cause when I woke up after being under about 10 seconds, I don't know where I was for a while.
[00:16:07.411 --> 00:16:08.171]  I was like, what's going on?
[00:16:08.211 --> 00:16:08.792]  What did I do?
[00:16:09.312 --> 00:16:09.892]  What's happening?
[00:16:09.912 --> 00:16:13.255]  And then it came back to me in the next minute that they just choked me out.
[00:16:13.275 --> 00:16:15.096]  So we're going to premiere that footage.
[00:16:16.337 --> 00:16:18.758]  I got in late today because I was up until like 2 in the morning working.
[00:16:18.778 --> 00:16:21.640]  I didn't get home until past midnight from doing the Crowder Show.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.021]  And so I got in here a little bit late today.
[00:16:24.041 --> 00:16:24.861]  And so...
[00:16:26.328 --> 00:16:29.030]  We're getting their footage, our footage, putting it together right now.
[00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.812]  So he'll be in here in the last segment of this hour.
[00:16:32.833 --> 00:16:44.822]  I was already going to get him on soon to talk about what the shots have done to the, not just the MMA community, but sports community, athletics community in general.
[00:16:44.882 --> 00:16:49.165]  So we'll also talk some about that, but this is destined to go viral.
[00:16:50.786 --> 00:16:55.231]  The crazy part is my eyes stayed open when I was choked out, but I'm like snorting.
[00:16:56.392 --> 00:16:57.233]  It was wild.
[00:16:57.754 --> 00:16:59.936]  And then when I woke up, man, it felt good.
[00:16:59.956 --> 00:17:01.297]  My brain was like, it's good to be back.
[00:17:01.358 --> 00:17:03.660]  I was like, wow, what am I on?
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.581]  What's going on?
[00:17:05.022 --> 00:17:06.863]  Craig Jones, what are you doing here?
[00:17:07.204 --> 00:17:08.946]  Oh, we just choked you out.
[00:17:11.024 --> 00:17:11.444]  It's ready?
[00:17:12.465 --> 00:17:13.566]  Oh, we already, okay.
[00:17:13.886 --> 00:17:14.847]  This is a little promo.
[00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:17.009]  And then they're gonna actually put the main video together.
[00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.749]  It's almost done.
[00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.111]  So it's in the computer.
[00:17:21.172 --> 00:17:22.914]  And so here's your first look.
[00:17:24.275 --> 00:17:25.095]  Eddie Bravo wouldn't do it.
[00:17:25.135 --> 00:17:25.676]  Come check me out.
[00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:27.891]  Come on, come do it.
[00:17:27.931 --> 00:17:29.833]  Listen, in high school we used to choke each other out.
[00:17:30.153 --> 00:17:30.693]  That's like a DMT.
[00:17:30.713 --> 00:17:31.574]  Go ahead and choke me out.
[00:17:31.594 --> 00:17:31.915]  On air.
[00:17:32.095 --> 00:17:33.015]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:17:33.035 --> 00:17:33.316]  Please don't.
[00:17:33.336 --> 00:17:34.277]  I'm not scared.
[00:17:35.337 --> 00:17:35.958]  Let's do it.
[00:17:36.078 --> 00:17:36.558]  No, no, no.
[00:17:36.578 --> 00:17:36.999]  Eddie, don't.
[00:17:37.259 --> 00:17:38.420]  Please don't choke him unconscious.
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:38.800]  Do it now.
[00:17:39.121 --> 00:17:39.561]  I'm not afraid.
[00:17:39.581 --> 00:17:39.901]  Let's go.
[00:17:40.262 --> 00:17:41.503]  He can't do it.
[00:17:41.583 --> 00:17:42.824]  You know, you think I'm afraid of this?
[00:17:42.844 --> 00:17:43.885]  Let's do it.
[00:17:44.185 --> 00:17:44.685]  Here we go.
[00:17:45.806 --> 00:17:47.107]  I'm going to light this out.
[00:17:47.127 --> 00:17:47.728]  Take a little sense.
[00:17:49.249 --> 00:17:51.249]  I put this up there.
[00:17:51.249 --> 00:17:53.249]  (Music)
[00:17:53.249 --> 00:17:55.249]  (Music)
[00:17:55.249 --> 00:17:57.249]  (Music)
[00:17:57.249 --> 00:17:59.249]  (Music)
[00:17:59.249 --> 00:18:03.249]   So, it's coming up today
[00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:05.249]  and it was pretty interesting.
[00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:06.346]  Man, it was, whoo!
[00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:13.274]  The other times I got choked out, I sound a little jerk, too.
[00:18:13.294 --> 00:18:20.622]  I actually just told you another horrible story about myself, turning the kitchen table over, and my dad choking me out.
[00:18:22.022 --> 00:18:23.343]  Broke blood vessels in both eyes.
[00:18:23.683 --> 00:18:25.723]  Like, red spots popped out.
[00:18:25.743 --> 00:18:26.304]  He got mad.
[00:18:27.324 --> 00:18:28.625]  I mean, like, choked me out, like, instantly.
[00:18:29.005 --> 00:18:30.165]  I just remember, like, pfft, gone.
[00:18:30.465 --> 00:18:32.346]  And it happened a few other times.
[00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:36.228]  And we did do this thing in junior high where you put each other against the wall and pass out.
[00:18:36.488 --> 00:18:39.749]  And you have, like, this weird dream while you're asleep and you pop back up.
[00:18:39.989 --> 00:18:40.609]  It's dangerous.
[00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:41.470]  Kids don't do it.
[00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.871]  You know, it killed David Carradine.
[00:18:44.612 --> 00:18:47.914]  I guess he was doing some sexual thing, I've never done that either.
[00:18:48.414 --> 00:18:56.799]  But I, it was side issue, but it's interesting, it's informative, and it's something you definitely don't do at home, or you don't do alone, you'll end up dead.
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:04.084]  Because just a few minutes of him keeping that going, I'd be bye-bye, or maybe in a minute or two, I'd just be brain damaged.
[00:19:04.964 --> 00:19:06.886]  It's kind of like another way of getting a lobotomy.
[00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.512]  Ladies and gentlemen, but I gotta tell you, I was tired.
[00:19:10.652 --> 00:19:12.814]  I've been up since 5 a.m.
[00:19:12.854 --> 00:19:13.154]  working.
[00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:13.995]  I've done my show.
[00:19:14.596 --> 00:19:15.536]  I've done a bunch of meetings.
[00:19:15.576 --> 00:19:16.697]  I've done his show.
[00:19:16.898 --> 00:19:26.145]  I was finishing an hour podcast with Craig and I was like, boom, awake and like refreshed when I came out of it.
[00:19:26.606 --> 00:19:31.029]  But I guess that's kind of what a brace with death, a brace with death is like.
[00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:32.651]  So there we are.
[00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:42.511]   All right, I'm done talking about that until he Comes in studio later in this hour, and then Mike Lindell is joining us.
[00:19:43.312 --> 00:19:48.595]  He's fighting hard against the globalists on so many fronts, and they're coming after him so much.
[00:19:49.216 --> 00:19:54.059]  I thought I'd get his take on some of the latest developments, and maybe even take some calls from Mike Lindell.
[00:19:54.859 --> 00:20:05.066]  But in the meantime, and in between those two guests, both of them are just popping in for like 20 minutes apiece, we're going to open the phones up again, and we're also going to cover the news.
[00:20:06.547 --> 00:20:08.388]  But just look at this news first.
[00:20:11.629 --> 00:20:32.363]   Did you know that no fewer than at least seven members of the national media, marquee, legacy, establishment, enemy of the people transmissions Six or seven, because they break it down on Twitter.
[00:20:32.563 --> 00:20:33.786]  I was just looking at that again this morning.
[00:20:33.826 --> 00:20:34.487]  It's in my stack.
[00:20:35.248 --> 00:20:37.332]  I was like, it's six or seven prominent?
[00:20:38.328 --> 00:20:42.431]  Journalists that debunked Pizzagate and said none of that was in WikiLeaks.
[00:20:42.892 --> 00:20:46.815]  And they did it by focusing on a pizza place to divert everybody off onto it.
[00:20:46.855 --> 00:20:50.317]  And some of the players that were involved in Pizzagate, the real Pizzagate, did go there.
[00:20:50.658 --> 00:20:52.179]  But then that was used as a distraction.
[00:20:52.219 --> 00:20:59.585]  Kind of like, you ever been sitting there in your yard and a rocking bird lands and is jumping around, chirping at you and acting like it's wings broken?
[00:20:59.605 --> 00:21:02.787]  Because it thinks you're a predator, but saying, come eat me.
[00:21:03.528 --> 00:21:07.091]  Because you look in the bushes, right around there, there's always a nest.
[00:21:08.359 --> 00:21:11.961]  And so, we had the WikiLeaks, we had the Aleister Crowley stuff.
[00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:16.044]  Oh, we're going to meet you at the blog cabin with the six and seven year old kids.
[00:21:16.104 --> 00:21:17.224]  They're there for your pleasure.
[00:21:17.785 --> 00:21:18.945]  They should follow your orders.
[00:21:19.005 --> 00:21:21.167]  Remember, they're just six and seven year old kids.
[00:21:22.488 --> 00:21:24.089]  I mean, this is hardcore.
[00:21:24.589 --> 00:21:29.672]  Obama wants, you know, sixty-something thousand dollars in hot dogs delivered to his party.
[00:21:29.952 --> 00:21:31.253]  That means male prostitutes.
[00:21:31.633 --> 00:21:32.534]  I mean, it's all in there.
[00:21:32.894 --> 00:21:43.264]   So they just diverted off In the New York Times and CNN to like, oh 4chan saying this is where it all happens at this pizza place to divert everybody off.
[00:21:45.866 --> 00:21:49.209]  Well, here's one of the kingpins, folks.
[00:21:49.529 --> 00:21:58.156]  ABC News anchor who debunked Pizzagate faces life in prison for child rape, raping small children seeking to rape more children.
[00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.752]  But the Feds say, go easy on him.
[00:22:01.792 --> 00:22:08.477]  Don't give him a sentence like Joe Biggs for walking in the Capitol, or Enrique Ontario for being there, and no proof, no witnesses, they planned anything.
[00:22:08.817 --> 00:22:09.678]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:22:10.839 --> 00:22:12.160]  Give Ray Epps a misdemeanor, too.
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.581]  You know, he said, go into the Capitals.
[00:22:13.641 --> 00:22:18.705]  He said he orchestrated it, and he helped bash giant signs into police, to barricades.
[00:22:19.185 --> 00:22:19.686]  That's okay.
[00:22:19.926 --> 00:22:20.527]  And this guy, too.
[00:22:21.818 --> 00:22:30.064]  The actual sentencing recommendation is life in prison for child rape, but the feds, they only want 15 years for him.
[00:22:31.746 --> 00:22:40.913]  ABC News reporter who bragged about debunking Pizzagate faces life in prison after being convicted of sickening array of child sex crimes.
[00:22:42.254 --> 00:22:46.026]   James Gordon Meek, Think you want that guy to babysit your kids?
[00:22:46.786 --> 00:23:07.218]  James Jordan Meek, who had worked at ABC News for nearly 10 years until an investigation into his child crimes, sex crimes, led to his arrest, was convicted of federal charges of transporting and possessing child sex abuse material in July, and again he reportedly and it's confirmed, raped children, and shot video of it.
[00:23:07.538 --> 00:23:27.703]   The prosecutors that tells Meek's actions in court papers that were filed last Friday, in them prosecutors, Zoe Bedell and Whitney Kramer wrote, he clearly sought out individuals across the internet for the specific purposes of sharing and expanding his child sexual abuse material collected for his sexual gratification.
[00:23:27.723 --> 00:23:29.843]  Why are they focusing on the child porn and not the child rape?
[00:23:30.063 --> 00:23:31.564]  You see the headline, child rape.
[00:23:31.903 --> 00:23:38.384]   They noted that Meek should have received pornography of infants and toddlers as well as content depicting sadistic
[00:23:38.384 --> 00:23:41.903]  and misogynistic abuse of pre-pubescent children.
[00:23:41.903 --> 00:23:48.903]  It just goes on from there.
[00:23:48.308 --> 00:23:50.849]  I'm not going to read the rest of this.
[00:23:51.589 --> 00:23:59.831]  But you can see the media backpedaling on all this and not trying to go to the things he's really done.
[00:24:01.491 --> 00:24:02.191]  Child rape.
[00:24:03.152 --> 00:24:03.872]  But that's buried.
[00:24:04.092 --> 00:24:05.372]  Oh, by the way, child rape.
[00:24:06.992 --> 00:24:14.234]  Feds recommend 15-year prison sentence for ex-ABC News journalists found guilty of sadistic child porn, where they torture children.
[00:24:15.495 --> 00:24:17.496]  Speaking of torturing children, child porn.
[00:24:20.317 --> 00:24:23.037]  They have opened the impeachment of Joe Biden.
[00:24:24.138 --> 00:24:27.479]  Biden, there's a new video out, tells people to stop questioning COVID shots.
[00:24:27.499 --> 00:24:31.720]  We'll cover that when Craig Jones is in here with us.
[00:24:32.881 --> 00:24:33.861]  I'll give you my breakdown.
[00:24:36.252 --> 00:24:39.775]  On what's happening with the Republican debate, but I mean really not much.
[00:24:39.835 --> 00:24:40.976]  It's all overshadowed by Trump.
[00:24:41.376 --> 00:24:44.398]  He gets around 60% of the field against all the other candidates.
[00:24:44.739 --> 00:24:45.659]  They're the Lilliputians.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:50.823]  They're the Tom Thumbs compared to him.
[00:24:51.044 --> 00:24:52.204]  They're the Keebler elves.
[00:24:54.246 --> 00:24:56.588]  But the big takeaway is where's the Democrat debate?
[00:24:57.689 --> 00:24:57.769]  Oh!
[00:24:58.936 --> 00:25:03.699]  They're saying they're not going to even let RFK on the ballot in New Hampshire and Iowa because he campaigned there.
[00:25:03.899 --> 00:25:05.801]  Their rules say you can't campaign.
[00:25:05.901 --> 00:25:06.101]  What?
[00:25:07.742 --> 00:25:08.583]  They're new rules.
[00:25:10.604 --> 00:25:16.688]  So they're tailoring everything for Joe Biden and his second basement candidacy if he refuses to step down.
[00:25:17.529 --> 00:25:21.432]  That's why they're allowing the corporate media to now attack Biden.
[00:25:21.492 --> 00:25:22.572]  He's fair game.
[00:25:22.612 --> 00:25:29.509]   Now they've indicted his son on a whitewash charge, but still they're beginning to apply The pressure.
[00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.213]  And of course, the big news all over the place.
[00:25:32.273 --> 00:25:33.634]  Trump found guilty!
[00:25:33.795 --> 00:25:35.497]  Ding dong, the witch is dead.
[00:25:35.557 --> 00:25:36.418]  The witch, oh witch.
[00:25:36.518 --> 00:25:37.259]  The witch, oh witch.
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.663]  Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead.
[00:25:39.683 --> 00:25:40.404]  That's what they're saying.
[00:25:40.424 --> 00:25:43.067]  And they're like, he'll have his hotels taken.
[00:25:43.087 --> 00:25:45.330]  He'll have his golf courses taken, the judge says.
[00:25:45.871 --> 00:25:58.395]  The judge found him guilty of saying Mar-a-Lago was worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and the judge says it's worth $18 million, even though the tax rolls say it's worth way more, and people are ready to buy it for $300 million today.
[00:25:58.815 --> 00:25:59.975]  It's not worth that.
[00:26:00.195 --> 00:26:10.859]  And if they say he exaggerated the worth of something in some financial statement, why, it just says in the headlines, Trump's set to lose everything!
[00:26:10.879 --> 00:26:13.499]  Like, how does that happen?
[00:26:13.799 --> 00:26:15.180]  Well, a judge defaults you.
[00:26:16.189 --> 00:26:17.170]  That's what he did.
[00:26:18.151 --> 00:26:27.401]  The judge finds you guilty, then has a civil trial, where they only put on their evidence, and then the jury comes back and says, we find him guilty, three billion dollars.
[00:26:27.901 --> 00:26:35.329]  And unlike me not having a million dollars with their fake, you know, garbage, Trump's got it, and then they start taking his stuff.
[00:26:38.857 --> 00:26:42.119]  Taking over the hotels, taking over the golf courses, and they're all over the news!
[00:26:42.519 --> 00:26:44.560]  We're gonna get your golf courses!
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.020]  We're gonna get your hotels!
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.542]  You put on a form that Mar-a-Lago's worth $18 million?
[00:26:50.943 --> 00:26:51.243]  Sure!
[00:26:52.685 --> 00:26:55.807]  Sure, they're selling two-acre vacant lots for $50 million.
[00:26:56.268 --> 00:26:59.270]  Sure, a three-bedroom across the street's worth $37 million.
[00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:10.618]  But this 150-something room, giant deal, incredible architecture, 20 acres on the water, next to the golf course, it's worth $18 million.
[00:27:11.579 --> 00:27:13.060]  Two-acre vacant lots worth $50?
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:13.540]  Okay!
[00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:20.552]  Sold last week, down the street, not even as good an area as that.
[00:27:20.572 --> 00:27:21.232]  It's very nice.
[00:27:21.252 --> 00:27:22.832]  It's the most elite area in Florida.
[00:27:23.793 --> 00:27:25.553]  But that is the elite of the elite.
[00:27:25.613 --> 00:27:27.214]  And they look at you and they say, nope.
[00:27:28.434 --> 00:27:28.634]  Nope.
[00:27:32.296 --> 00:27:33.196]  Trump's a liar.
[00:27:33.896 --> 00:27:34.597]  He's a fraud.
[00:27:34.637 --> 00:27:35.817]  He loses everything.
[00:27:36.757 --> 00:27:37.838]  Oh, question of mass shooting?
[00:27:37.918 --> 00:27:38.578]  Lose everything.
[00:27:39.078 --> 00:27:41.199]  Oh, judge says you're a fraud?
[00:27:41.379 --> 00:27:42.139]  Lose everything.
[00:27:42.739 --> 00:27:43.960]  That's what tyranny is.
[00:27:46.075 --> 00:27:46.675]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:27:46.715 --> 00:27:49.857]  Please remember we're Lister Supported and something very exciting has happened.

[00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:16.490]  It's amazing.

[00:28:33.324 --> 00:28:34.124]  They're no longer available.
[00:28:34.324 --> 00:28:35.324]  I told you it's limited edition.

[00:28:52.512 --> 00:28:53.913]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:28:53.933 --> 00:28:55.434]  That ought to be called Essential Fusion.
[00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:57.415]  Because it is everything essential.
[00:28:58.035 --> 00:29:00.818]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:29:00.878 --> 00:29:12.471]  We're gonna go to break, come back with the General Milley, treason news, and then Craig Jones chokes me out live on air.
[00:29:13.211 --> 00:29:13.532]  All right.
[00:29:14.679 --> 00:29:16.860]  Again, later in the show, the crews put it together.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.901]  I'm going to just show a few of the clips because it would take 30 minutes to show them all.
[00:29:20.021 --> 00:29:24.363]  I mean, we've literally got that much of leaders saying, we're going to kill Trump.
[00:29:24.783 --> 00:29:25.683]  He's guilty of treason.
[00:29:25.703 --> 00:29:27.884]  We're going to throw him out of the White House using the military.
[00:29:28.644 --> 00:29:29.764]  He needs to be executed.
[00:29:31.645 --> 00:29:41.729]  And now he puts out on Truth Social that Millie is on 60 Minutes attacking him and all this stuff and doing this whole tour about to retire.
[00:29:43.519 --> 00:29:51.562]  Trump says, the guy's guilty of treason, going above my head to the Communist Chinese and saying, don't worry, I got the new codes, don't worry, Trump's not going to do anything, I'm not going to let him.
[00:29:51.762 --> 00:29:53.083]  And that's what he bragged and said he did.
[00:29:53.103 --> 00:30:01.966]  I remember Pelosi bragged, oh don't worry, Milley promises us he won't let Trump set up martial law.
[00:30:02.887 --> 00:30:05.328]  They were the ones saying all this and doing all this.
[00:30:06.808 --> 00:30:08.809]  And now they say Trump's going to put them all in prison.
[00:30:09.109 --> 00:30:12.711]  They're the ones trying to put everybody that opposes them in prison, and we've done nothing wrong.
[00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:14.392]  They're the ones that have taken over the government.
[00:30:14.652 --> 00:30:16.813]  They're the ones using the CIA against the American people.
[00:30:17.073 --> 00:30:18.334]  They're the ones dissolving the border.
[00:30:18.574 --> 00:30:19.934]  They're the ones starting World War III.
[00:30:20.154 --> 00:30:21.495]  They're the ones devaluing the currency.
[00:30:23.556 --> 00:30:24.216]  Here's what Trump said.
[00:30:24.276 --> 00:30:41.720]   Mark Milley, who led perhaps the most embarrassing moment in American history with his grossly incompetent implementation of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, Costing many lives, leaving behind hundreds of American citizens, and handing over billions of dollars of military's finest equipment ever made.
[00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:44.222]  We'll be leaving the military next week.
[00:30:44.442 --> 00:30:48.066]  This will be a time for all citizens of the USA to celebrate.
[00:30:48.826 --> 00:30:56.133]  This guy turned out to be a woke train wreck who, if the fake news reporting is correct, was actually dealing with China.
[00:30:57.352 --> 00:31:00.293]  To give them a heads up on the thinking of the President of the United States.
[00:31:00.653 --> 00:31:05.614]  This is an act of so egregious, in times gone by, the punishment would have been death.
[00:31:05.994 --> 00:31:07.234]  And that's just true, folks.
[00:31:07.794 --> 00:31:10.595]  Your top general secretly talking to the top general of our main enemy?
[00:31:12.075 --> 00:31:13.995]  And saying, don't worry, I don't do what the President says?
[00:31:14.616 --> 00:31:18.456]  That's, that's, that's... That's totally illegal.
[00:31:18.596 --> 00:31:19.477]  That's called being a spy.
[00:31:20.917 --> 00:31:21.737]  Keep going, put it back on screen.
[00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:29.493]  A war between China and the United States could have been the result of this treasonous act.
[00:31:30.134 --> 00:31:30.494]  Bingo.
[00:31:31.014 --> 00:31:36.200]  You know, when I had the Feds reach out and say, we noticed you got a visa to Russia to go interview people four years ago.
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.263]  That's disloyal and you better not do it.
[00:31:39.543 --> 00:31:42.046]  And I challenged the system.
[00:31:42.186 --> 00:31:44.248]  You know, I buck them whenever I feel like it's right.
[00:31:44.568 --> 00:31:46.110]  I was already thinking about not going.
[00:31:47.142 --> 00:31:48.043]  Because I'm so busy.
[00:31:48.983 --> 00:31:51.645]  And also, I'm like, man, people really believe this Russiagate crap.
[00:31:52.325 --> 00:31:54.727]  Sure, it'd be a big show, big interviews.
[00:31:54.747 --> 00:31:55.908]  It'd be interesting.
[00:31:56.108 --> 00:31:57.589]  But you know what?
[00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:58.529]  I'm not going to do it.
[00:31:58.709 --> 00:32:03.032]  Because it will give them a weapon to try to make them believe I'm actually a Russian agent.
[00:32:03.272 --> 00:32:03.873]  So I didn't go.
[00:32:04.373 --> 00:32:05.814]  Now they've done that to Tucker Carlson.
[00:32:06.778 --> 00:32:09.740]  And he noticed he didn't go, because he got approached by the government.
[00:32:10.221 --> 00:32:14.304]  He hasn't given the details, but he didn't give the details of the NSA illegally spying on him.
[00:32:14.344 --> 00:32:15.845]  And months later, it came out in Congress.
[00:32:15.865 --> 00:32:20.068]  They were like, yeah, we were spying on Tucker Carlson, because he was trying to interview Putin then.
[00:32:20.608 --> 00:32:24.471]  So why does Megyn Kelly and NBC get to interview him on Dateline?
[00:32:25.712 --> 00:32:29.835]  Why did 60 Minutes and everybody always be able to go interview Saddam Hussein during the war?
[00:32:30.595 --> 00:32:31.096]  Both of them.
[00:32:32.397 --> 00:32:32.677]  Why?
[00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:34.058]  Because they're controlled.
[00:32:36.218 --> 00:32:40.805]  So, I'm being honest, I'm already up against these people, they're already coming after me.
[00:32:41.606 --> 00:32:46.032]  I did what Tucker did, and I've never really talked about it in detail until now.
[00:32:47.443 --> 00:32:55.405]  I was just like, okay, because after a couple calls, you know, I mean, we're talking high level CIA, you name it, FBI.
[00:32:55.965 --> 00:32:57.766]  Alex, we really, you're a good guy now.
[00:32:58.446 --> 00:33:01.026]  We've been told there's some stuff going to get turned loose on you.
[00:33:01.066 --> 00:33:02.167]  You think things bad now.
[00:33:02.547 --> 00:33:04.567]  You don't want to be under investigation for espionage.
[00:33:04.607 --> 00:33:05.828]  You don't want to go to Russia.
[00:33:06.568 --> 00:33:07.488]  That's what Tucker got told.
[00:33:08.788 --> 00:33:09.369]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:33:09.949 --> 00:33:10.469]  I confirmed it.
[00:33:11.408 --> 00:33:13.849]  So, at a certain point, you're just like, this country's gone.
[00:33:14.049 --> 00:33:21.973]  I mean, you guys are on the phone with the head of the Chinese Communist saying, don't worry, I got the nuke codes and Trump isn't in command, and that's what came out.
[00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:23.894]  And the media's like, isn't that great?
[00:33:24.375 --> 00:33:28.376]  And then I can't go interview people, or you're going to sick the CIA even more?
[00:33:28.397 --> 00:33:31.558]  And I don't mean shutting down bank accounts or suing me.
[00:33:31.938 --> 00:33:37.701]  I mean, you know, pointing drugs on you, having you, quote, carjacked, you get a bullet in your head.
[00:33:38.241 --> 00:33:44.917]   And at a certain point, I just, it's a win-win to just expose it.
[00:33:45.397 --> 00:33:49.278]  It's a cost-benefit analysis when it gets down to it, but that's where this country is.
[00:33:49.498 --> 00:33:50.278]  They threatened me.
[00:33:50.598 --> 00:33:51.858]  They threatened Tucker Carlson.
[00:33:53.378 --> 00:33:55.139]  I didn't tell anybody this was going on.
[00:33:55.939 --> 00:34:05.600]  And then my other contacts, I'll leave it at that, go, hey, you know, high-level CIA, this is a guy that's worked for them a lot, called me and said, hey, you know, you better watch out.
[00:34:06.361 --> 00:34:08.101]  And I'm like, yeah, I've already gotten two phone calls.
[00:34:08.201 --> 00:34:08.681]  I know, okay.
[00:34:09.921 --> 00:34:13.763]  So, that's where this is, and that's what's happened to this country.
[00:34:14.204 --> 00:34:23.029]  So, here's Milley, using the psychology on 60 Minutes, that, oh, well, when he attacks me, he attacks the entire armed services.
[00:34:23.069 --> 00:34:25.410]  No, Milley, you attacked him with critical race theory.
[00:34:26.311 --> 00:34:27.572]  You attacked him with transgenderism.
[00:34:27.852 --> 00:34:29.133]  You attacked him with a poison shot.
[00:34:29.413 --> 00:34:35.957]  You attacked him by not taking care of the barracks and the troops, and running him in the ground, and creating woke-ism to create a purge.
[00:34:36.377 --> 00:34:37.458]  So, here is the traitor.
[00:34:38.251 --> 00:34:46.696]  President Trump recently said that your dealings with China were so egregious that in times gone by, the punishment would have been death.
[00:34:46.716 --> 00:34:52.060]  That's right, he said that.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:53.040]  That's correct.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.762]  He is suggesting that you be punished by death.
[00:34:56.542 --> 00:35:00.305]  The former commander-in-chief to his former top military advisor.
[00:35:01.415 --> 00:35:02.476]  Look, I'm a soldier.
[00:35:02.877 --> 00:35:06.019]  I've been faithful and loyal to the Constitution of the United States for 44 and a half years.
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.163]  And my family and I have sacrificed greatly for this country.
[00:35:10.663 --> 00:35:11.925]  My mother and father before them.
[00:35:12.665 --> 00:35:18.530]  And, you know, as much as these comments are directed at me, it's also directed at the institution of the military.
[00:35:19.351 --> 00:35:22.354]  And there's 2.1 million of us in uniform.
[00:35:22.794 --> 00:35:26.954]   And the American people can take it to the bank that all of us, every single one of us,
[00:35:26.954 --> 00:35:30.274]   from private to general, will loyal to that constitution and will never turn our back
[00:35:30.274 --> 00:35:31.274]  on it no matter what.
[00:35:31.274 --> 00:35:34.153]  No matter what the threats, no matter what the humiliations.
[00:35:34.153 --> 00:35:35.153]  That's enough.
[00:35:35.153 --> 00:35:40.074]   So, so you can't ever question us because we're all good and we're all perfect and we
[00:35:40.074 --> 00:35:43.914]   don't need any oversight and we can talk to the Chinese generals and tell them don't worry,
[00:35:43.914 --> 00:35:45.094]  we're really in command.
[00:35:45.094 --> 00:35:46.313]  There's a deep state coup here.
[00:35:46.313 --> 00:35:47.313]  Trump doesn't run things.
[00:35:47.313 --> 00:35:52.234]   And I remember the top Chinese Communist Party had big events where they got up and bragged
[00:35:52.234 --> 00:35:55.233]  that don't worry the wise men are in charge.
[00:35:55.233 --> 00:36:05.233]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:59.230]  Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.
[00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:01.611]  They actually said that.
[00:36:01.811 --> 00:36:03.632]  And Trump isn't running anything.
[00:36:07.253 --> 00:36:08.753]  Boy, that sure undermines our country.
[00:36:09.014 --> 00:36:12.255]  But it's okay, because General Milley says so.
[00:36:13.226 --> 00:36:13.606]  Remember him?
[00:36:13.926 --> 00:36:16.727]  Well, I want to investigate number one threat, white people.
[00:36:16.807 --> 00:36:17.247]  I'm white!
[00:36:17.788 --> 00:36:19.168]  And I want to know about white rage.
[00:36:19.208 --> 00:36:21.449]  Number one threat's January 6th and those traitors.
[00:36:21.709 --> 00:36:23.570]  We got a lot of bad white people in this country.
[00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.331]  What a punk.
[00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:28.552]  This is such a powerful report.
[00:36:28.612 --> 00:36:34.334]  I rarely air reports twice in a row, but it ties into all the breaking huge news from the Poisoned Shot front.
[00:36:35.236 --> 00:36:40.722]  That we're going to be getting to here today and all these different deaths of athletes.
[00:36:41.543 --> 00:36:50.011]  And then Craig Jones, top worldwide grappler is going to be in studio coming up with in just about four or five minutes.
[00:36:49.851 --> 00:36:51.851]  So please stay with us.
[00:36:51.851 --> 00:37:04.550]   Naomi Wolf and her team at the Daily Clout submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the
[00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:11.171]   Centers for Disease Control requesting all emails sent and received by Dr.
[00:37:11.171 --> 00:37:19.090]   Rochelle P. Walensky, Sherry A. Berger, and Kevin Griffiths between the dates of February 1st and May 31st of
[00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:25.639]   2021 containing the word myocarditis They received hundreds of pages
[00:37:26.019 --> 00:37:36.526]  Showing that the White House and the entire COVID response team knew that the COVID vaccines were killing people and causing blood clots, heart attacks, and myocarditis.
[00:37:37.107 --> 00:37:41.270]  They also received 46 additional pages that were not requested.
[00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:50.456]  Of these 46 pages, over 80% of them were fully redacted and involved the White House and the Executive Office of the President.
[00:37:50.916 --> 00:37:57.462]  These redacted emails were labeled draft White House script and some tough Q&A.
[00:37:58.182 --> 00:38:03.047]  They knew in the spring of 2021 that these shots were killing people.
[00:38:03.367 --> 00:38:10.033]  I've said it over and over, and I don't mean to belabor this, but to remind everyone, when Steve says, how could this happen?
[00:38:10.533 --> 00:38:18.940]   I always say from my experience working around a White House, That it can't happen unless the boss says it has to, or that it can.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:26.824]  You can't kill Americans, I've said this so many times on this show, knowingly, without the okay of the president.
[00:38:27.005 --> 00:38:32.588]  So I knew that up the chain of command, the White House had to be involved in these decisions.
[00:38:33.058 --> 00:38:34.798]  But we just didn't have the smoking gun.
[00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:36.279]  Now we have the smoking gun.
[00:38:36.339 --> 00:38:38.419]  You remember we have 200 volunteer lawyers.
[00:38:38.659 --> 00:38:48.862]  So one of these lawyers' name is Ed Berkovich, and he FOIAed, meaning sent a Freedom of Information Act demand to the CDC about myocarditis.
[00:38:49.202 --> 00:38:51.422]  And something very interesting happened.
[00:38:51.622 --> 00:39:01.182]  He got 472 pages from the CDC in response to that FOIA.
[00:39:01.182 --> 00:39:06.822]   He was also given an additional 46 pages, which he didn't ask for.
[00:39:07.432 --> 00:39:13.854]  And these additional 46 pages, over 80% of the pages were fully redacted.
[00:39:14.134 --> 00:39:17.735]  The redactions were, quote, pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
[00:39:18.355 --> 00:39:19.555]  552 Exemptions 5 and 6.
[00:39:20.515 --> 00:39:27.217]  What is redacted was solicited or shared with the president or his most senior advisors.
[00:39:27.397 --> 00:39:28.557]  They know it's happening.
[00:39:28.617 --> 00:39:30.778]  The other thing they're freaking out about is myocarditis.
[00:39:31.218 --> 00:39:32.319]  They know what's happening.
[00:39:32.379 --> 00:39:40.746]  The evidence came in, the updates came in, and the American people are going to be asking questions or starting to ask questions.
[00:39:41.106 --> 00:39:51.815]  So they convene a crisis, a set of crisis meetings, basically, in which they're basically trying to formulate a press response.
[00:39:51.835 --> 00:39:53.176]  These are all press people.
[00:39:53.496 --> 00:39:56.579]  They crafted a media response.
[00:39:57.019 --> 00:40:00.762]  And by the way, there are people who deal with broadcast news as well in that list.
[00:40:01.215 --> 00:40:05.717]  And the media response doesn't tell the truth after May of 2021.
[00:40:06.158 --> 00:40:10.480]  They rolled out myocarditis and remember what they said always?
[00:40:11.321 --> 00:40:13.882]  Extremely rare, mild resolves.
[00:40:14.322 --> 00:40:16.543]  Extremely rare, mild resolves.
[00:40:16.884 --> 00:40:22.967]  They knew that they were lying and they said nothing about the clotting issue from what I recall.
[00:40:23.027 --> 00:40:48.831]   So basically they created from this set of crisis communications Directed by the White House, with the White House's most senior advisors, the COVID-19 Response Project, which was overseen by the White House, at the behest of the White House, to create a media response that you experienced all of 2021, all of 2022, to get you to keep injecting this into your body and injecting it into the bodies of your loved ones.
[00:40:49.111 --> 00:40:56.755]  And they knew that they were lying and they knew that they were hurting people with blood clots, platelet problems and heart damage.
[00:40:56.835 --> 00:40:58.575]  And that's what they did and that's what happened.
[00:40:58.816 --> 00:41:01.816]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reis.
[00:41:01.816 --> 00:41:14.816]  [Intro Music]
[00:41:14.816 --> 00:41:22.945]   When castles towered over vast landscapes and knights championed honor and valor, there came an unforeseen
[00:41:22.945 --> 00:41:23.816]  darkness.
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:30.884]  Amidst this impending doom stood a knight called Alex Jones, a brave and outspoken herald known as the Truth Sayer.
[00:41:31.064 --> 00:41:32.945]  Sir Alex Jones was not alone.
[00:41:33.185 --> 00:41:38.788]  In his most desperate hour in the battle against evil, a radiant light descended from the heavens.
[00:41:39.188 --> 00:41:43.611]  God, in all his glory and his legion of angels, stood by Alex's side.
[00:41:43.911 --> 00:41:48.774]  The battle raged on, but with every blow, Alex Jones' conviction grew stronger.
[00:41:49.034 --> 00:41:52.656]  With every truth he proclaimed, the demonic forces faltered.
[00:41:53.257 --> 00:42:00.681]  When the enemy was vanquished, Alex Jones swore a solemn oath that should the realm need him again, he would return.
[00:42:01.341 --> 00:42:07.225]  And now it's Alex Jones, leading a full frontal assault on the satanic New World Order.
[00:42:07.805 --> 00:42:12.288]  Tune in at infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:16.581]  Eddie Bravo wouldn't do it.
[00:42:16.621 --> 00:42:17.221]  Come chuck me out.
[00:42:17.981 --> 00:42:19.382]  Come on, come do it.
[00:42:19.422 --> 00:42:21.343]  Listen, in high school, we used to choke each other out.
[00:42:21.643 --> 00:42:22.064]  That's like a DMT.
[00:42:22.084 --> 00:42:23.044]  Go ahead and chuck me out.
[00:42:23.064 --> 00:42:23.404]  On air.
[00:42:23.604 --> 00:42:24.505]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:42:24.525 --> 00:42:24.925]  Please don't.
[00:42:24.985 --> 00:42:25.786]  I'm not scared.
[00:42:25.966 --> 00:42:27.447]  Let's do it.
[00:42:27.567 --> 00:42:28.067]  No, no, no.
[00:42:28.127 --> 00:42:28.507]  Eddie, don't.
[00:42:28.687 --> 00:42:29.908]  Please don't choke him unconscious.
[00:42:29.948 --> 00:42:30.288]  Do it now.
[00:42:30.508 --> 00:42:31.049]  I'm not afraid.
[00:42:31.089 --> 00:42:31.409]  Let's go.
[00:42:31.769 --> 00:42:33.010]  He can't do it.
[00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:34.310]  You know, you think I'm afraid of this?
[00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:35.411]  Let's do it.
[00:42:35.671 --> 00:42:36.191]  Here we go.
[00:42:37.312 --> 00:42:38.513]  I'm going to lights out.
[00:42:38.533 --> 00:42:39.233]  Take a little sense.
[00:42:40.734 --> 00:42:56.734]   I put this stuff down And we are back
[00:42:56.635 --> 00:42:58.717]  Well, I've been wanting to get Craig Jones in here.
[00:42:58.777 --> 00:43:00.358]  He's the top grappler in the world.
[00:43:00.399 --> 00:43:02.301]  He doesn't like to say that, but he recognizes that.
[00:43:02.941 --> 00:43:05.104]  I guess his teammates have been off and on the top guy in the world.
[00:43:05.904 --> 00:43:07.326]  But he's a good friend of mine.
[00:43:07.626 --> 00:43:10.129]  Lives here in Austin for three years since the COVID lockdowns.
[00:43:10.169 --> 00:43:11.210]  And I guess he decided to stay.
[00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:13.192]  He's a great immigrant to our nation.
[00:43:13.212 --> 00:43:14.634]  Brings a lot to the table.
[00:43:15.374 --> 00:43:19.515]  Joe Rogan and Eddie and I love to go out and see some of the big matches he's had here in Austin.
[00:43:19.535 --> 00:43:22.816]  Of course one, and it's great to have Craig Jones.
[00:43:23.236 --> 00:43:26.617]  Craig Jones BJJ on Instagram.
[00:43:26.837 --> 00:43:28.998]  Just Craig Jones MMA.
[00:43:29.018 --> 00:43:33.619]  I'll bring him up everywhere at Craig Jones BJJ at B-T-E-M-A.
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:41.980]   JJ and he's got his a B team jujitsu folks here with him here today.
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:45.740]  So I wanted to get you on about you took one of the shots.
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.380]  I think it was Pfizer, right?
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:48.380]  I believe so. Yeah.
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.179]  And you got pretty sick from it.
[00:43:50.179 --> 00:43:51.140]  And that was a couple of years ago.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:52.540]  She didn't take the others.
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:53.619]  I want you to recap that.
[00:43:53.619 --> 00:43:55.860]  And now they admit massive myocarditis.
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:59.540]   They covered it up record hundreds and hundreds of deaths in sports
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.980]  used to be incredibly rare.
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.140]  Young people in high school dying girls, boys. It's insane.
[00:44:04.197 --> 00:44:12.123]  You know a lot of other athletes obviously in hindsight now talk about what happened to you And then since then what you think really has unfolded here.
[00:44:12.143 --> 00:44:18.167]   This is a pretty big scandal Oh yeah, so I mean, I got the COVID, I got the Pfizer shot, the first one.
[00:44:18.607 --> 00:44:25.851]  I just want to say, I got this shot because a lot of people were talking about natural immunity, but given my experience with HIV, I was a bit worried about going down that path again.
[00:44:26.391 --> 00:44:31.574]  But I had the vaccine and I ended up getting this swelling in my stomach, a little like I was pregnant.
[00:44:31.594 --> 00:44:34.356]  But that took about a week to disappear.
[00:44:34.916 --> 00:44:35.336]  Over a week.
[00:44:35.837 --> 00:44:38.058]  Yeah, we had the pictures of it, it looked pretty bad.
[00:44:38.078 --> 00:44:39.699]  I still don't know what happened there.
[00:44:40.059 --> 00:44:41.340]  What was your experience with HIV?
[00:44:42.443 --> 00:44:45.384]  I was just joking.
[00:44:46.024 --> 00:44:47.144]  You are quite the joker.
[00:44:48.285 --> 00:44:49.765]  I like you believed it though, you believed it.
[00:44:50.566 --> 00:44:50.806]  Oh man.
[00:44:50.826 --> 00:44:52.366]  I thought we were going to take out Kissinger.
[00:44:53.146 --> 00:44:53.606]  That's right.
[00:44:53.827 --> 00:44:55.047]  We didn't hear back from him overnight?
[00:44:55.707 --> 00:44:56.207]  No I didn't.
[00:44:57.027 --> 00:44:58.488]  Oh that's right, you want to date Kissinger.
[00:44:58.728 --> 00:45:01.929]  Well that was our path into Bohemian Grove, the second time.
[00:45:02.089 --> 00:45:04.170]  That's right, we're going to sneak into Bohemian Grove together. 2024.
[00:45:05.902 --> 00:45:13.484]  You know, what happened when you choked me out is I kind of forgot the hour-long podcast we taped and literally didn't know where I was after you had just done it.
[00:45:13.564 --> 00:45:15.845]  I was like, first thing I said is, what did I do?
[00:45:16.805 --> 00:45:18.365]  Yeah, it's a very strange feeling.
[00:45:18.405 --> 00:45:19.466]  You like, uh, don't know.
[00:45:19.886 --> 00:45:22.726]  When it's happened to me, I didn't even know who I was, let alone where I was.
[00:45:23.687 --> 00:45:26.107]  But you come back, you come back 10 seconds, I can get you back to it.
[00:45:26.547 --> 00:45:27.628]  I mean, describe what it's like.
[00:45:27.668 --> 00:45:28.628]  How many times you've been choked out?
[00:45:29.432 --> 00:45:39.374]  Oh, I think, I think only one time proper out, but like I was out and awake straight away, but I still for over 10 seconds, I remember just sitting there being like, who am I?
[00:45:39.774 --> 00:45:42.435]  I had no idea who I was, but it comes back pretty quick.
[00:45:42.475 --> 00:45:44.056]  You feel that energy boost you had yesterday.
[00:45:45.456 --> 00:45:47.076]  I look over and I go, that's Craig Jones.
[00:45:47.116 --> 00:45:47.696]  What's he doing?
[00:45:47.716 --> 00:45:48.337]  What?
[00:45:48.397 --> 00:45:49.317]  I was like, where are we?
[00:45:49.437 --> 00:45:50.997]  I was like, why am I in my studio?
[00:45:51.657 --> 00:45:52.658]  That's why I said, what did I do?
[00:45:52.678 --> 00:45:53.758]  Yeah, I know.
[00:45:53.778 --> 00:45:55.078]  That was, uh, that was funny.
[00:45:55.118 --> 00:45:57.639]  You were out for probably 10, 15 seconds.
[00:45:57.879 --> 00:45:58.439]  You're out a while.
[00:45:59.793 --> 00:46:10.363]  I haven't had psychotic breaks since I was about 17 but I had a few psychotic breaks growing up and so I remember like getting so mad and fights and things and not remembering what happened and then like coming back and like where am I?
[00:46:10.383 --> 00:46:11.764]  So that's why I was like what did I do?
[00:46:11.824 --> 00:46:13.806]  Like what's got me felt like that?
[00:46:14.546 --> 00:46:21.553]  Yeah right yeah I mean yeah for sure the memory the memory loss following it's pretty pretty strange but you still don't remember the podcast or?
[00:46:22.053 --> 00:46:26.053]   I remember parts of it now, but I just, it was still, it made it foggy.
[00:46:26.053 --> 00:46:29.053]   Because I guess it kind of erased a lot of memory that happened in the hour before.
[00:46:29.053 --> 00:46:30.053]  Yeah.
[00:46:30.053 --> 00:46:35.053]   I mean, it took me a good 30 seconds to figure out what was going on.
[00:46:35.053 --> 00:46:37.053]  Yeah, I thought you were messing with me at first.
[00:46:37.053 --> 00:46:39.053]  I was like, "Oh, he's messing with me."
[00:46:39.053 --> 00:46:43.053]   No, I mean, you couldn't tell it, but if you watch the video now, you can hear it.
[00:46:43.053 --> 00:46:44.053]  I say, "No, no, I'm done."
[00:46:44.592 --> 00:46:47.295]  It kind of got scary when you put the pressure on.
[00:46:47.355 --> 00:46:48.336]  Whoa, I'm going out.
[00:46:48.676 --> 00:46:51.699]  I thought you were just going, whoa, he's not going to get me.
[00:46:51.819 --> 00:46:52.240]  Oh, yeah.
[00:46:53.201 --> 00:46:57.406]  So, again, we didn't just do this as a stunt like Jackass or something.
[00:46:58.226 --> 00:46:59.908]  We didn't do it on Joe's podcast.
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:11.905]  Because Joe obviously didn't want the liability, but I was only talking about because I'd been knocked out a few times before, and I was talking about the experiences, and I thought it'd be an interesting test, but nobody should do this at home.
[00:47:12.205 --> 00:47:13.046]  You could easily get killed.
[00:47:13.526 --> 00:47:14.546]  Yeah, for sure, for sure.
[00:47:15.147 --> 00:47:16.247]  That's why we had you lift your arms.
[00:47:16.827 --> 00:47:20.429]  It's sometimes hard to tell if someone's unconscious, but when you go unconscious, your arms fall down.
[00:47:20.449 --> 00:47:24.371]  As soon as your arms fall down, obviously we know now to let go of the chug.
[00:47:24.811 --> 00:47:27.113]  And also, I started snorting, right?
[00:47:27.633 --> 00:47:28.413]  You snorted, yeah.
[00:47:28.433 --> 00:47:29.754]  You fought back to consciousness.
[00:47:30.734 --> 00:47:30.995]  Really?
[00:47:31.255 --> 00:47:32.718]  Yeah, it was a strong fight.
[00:47:33.078 --> 00:47:33.379]  Really?
[00:47:33.579 --> 00:47:34.401]  Yeah.
[00:47:34.701 --> 00:47:35.663]  I mean, it felt really good.
[00:47:35.683 --> 00:47:36.685]  I was like, oh, this feels good.
[00:47:36.805 --> 00:47:38.889]  I was like, what am I, where am I?
[00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:42.415]  Until it happens that you don't understand David Carradine.
[00:47:43.322 --> 00:47:43.502]  Yeah.
[00:47:43.702 --> 00:47:44.783]  And then when it happens, it feels good.
[00:47:44.803 --> 00:47:46.784]  So you can only imagine what the combination would feel like.
[00:47:47.004 --> 00:47:47.225]  It did.
[00:47:47.465 --> 00:47:48.926]  I was high as a kite for about 10 minutes.
[00:47:49.386 --> 00:47:50.347]  Don't do it, folks.
[00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:51.948]  Yeah, don't do it.
[00:47:52.028 --> 00:47:52.588]  What were you saying?
[00:47:52.648 --> 00:47:53.929]  What would you do?
[00:47:53.949 --> 00:47:59.993]  I was like one of the most popular people in middle school because we would choke each other out and the girls liked it.
[00:48:00.934 --> 00:48:02.134]  And we would do it.
[00:48:02.295 --> 00:48:03.215]  You push them against the wall.
[00:48:03.295 --> 00:48:03.675]  Boom.
[00:48:03.735 --> 00:48:04.216]  They go out.
[00:48:04.476 --> 00:48:05.797]  I believe a lot of women still like it.
[00:48:06.277 --> 00:48:06.837]  They do like it.
[00:48:07.278 --> 00:48:09.019]  I've had quite a few girlfriends say, choke me.
[00:48:09.039 --> 00:48:09.419]  I don't do it.
[00:48:11.547 --> 00:48:12.048]  They do like it.
[00:48:12.248 --> 00:48:12.988]  How would you do it in school?
[00:48:13.008 --> 00:48:14.329]  You'd push on the chest or something?
[00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:14.969]  No, no, push on the neck.
[00:48:15.189 --> 00:48:15.790]  Push on the neck.
[00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:17.451]  No, I mean, like, say there's a brick wall here.
[00:48:17.511 --> 00:48:18.591]  Oh, hold him up by the neck.
[00:48:18.731 --> 00:48:21.133]  No, just... You know, the carotid arteries are right here.
[00:48:21.233 --> 00:48:21.813]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:21.953 --> 00:48:22.593]  Here, I'll simulate.
[00:48:22.613 --> 00:48:23.034]  Stand over here.
[00:48:23.054 --> 00:48:23.654]  I'm not gonna do it.
[00:48:23.854 --> 00:48:25.555]  Don't beat me up.
[00:48:25.715 --> 00:48:26.576]  Just crank the mics up.
[00:48:26.596 --> 00:48:31.038]  So you're back against the... Oh, yeah.
[00:48:31.278 --> 00:48:32.019]  It does feel good.
[00:48:32.699 --> 00:48:33.780]  That's how they... That's how you do it.
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.601]  It probably gave me some brain damage.
[00:48:36.681 --> 00:48:38.002]  I probably... We probably did it.
[00:48:40.064 --> 00:48:47.166]  30, 40 times when I was in 8th grade and the principals all called us in and they had like the girls all lined up outside and the boys and like, who's taught who this?
[00:48:47.826 --> 00:48:49.007]  I was taught it by some other kids.
[00:48:49.287 --> 00:48:50.587]  Maybe... But then I quit.
[00:48:50.707 --> 00:48:51.747]  I quit, but it was, yeah.
[00:48:51.967 --> 00:48:54.488]  Maybe you started the trend for women.
[00:48:54.508 --> 00:48:55.268]  No, I did not start it.
[00:48:55.308 --> 00:48:56.169]  Somebody else showed it to me.
[00:48:56.669 --> 00:48:56.949]  Oh, really?
[00:48:57.799 --> 00:48:57.999]  Yeah.
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:06.385]  I had a neighbor who had an older hot sister, and I was like 12, and I was always over there hitting on her, and she knew about it.
[00:49:06.725 --> 00:49:08.747]  And then she was showing us how to do it.
[00:49:08.987 --> 00:49:10.448]  Did you do it to her, or she did it to you?
[00:49:10.468 --> 00:49:10.968]  She did it to me.
[00:49:10.988 --> 00:49:14.550]  I don't know, she was hot, man.
[00:49:14.751 --> 00:49:21.495]  And I never got to go out with her, but the point was, the point is that a girl first choked me out.
[00:49:21.535 --> 00:49:22.176]  That's who showed me.
[00:49:22.376 --> 00:49:24.377]  And folks, we're not telling young people to do this.
[00:49:24.717 --> 00:49:26.679]  You can die, you can get brain damage, it's dangerous.
[00:49:27.833 --> 00:49:28.894]  Yeah, yeah, that's for sure.
[00:49:29.054 --> 00:49:31.635]  If you're going to do it, at least train some jiu-jitsu first, right?
[00:49:31.856 --> 00:49:33.557]  That's the only good place to do it, right?
[00:49:34.357 --> 00:49:37.339]  That, and in the bedroom with a loved one maybe, but yeah.
[00:49:37.359 --> 00:49:39.420]  Have you ever had girlfriends ask you to chug them out?
[00:49:39.461 --> 00:49:40.541]  For sure, for sure, yeah.
[00:49:40.781 --> 00:49:41.882]  I don't know where that comes from.
[00:49:42.042 --> 00:49:43.363]  I feel like most women like that, right?
[00:49:45.024 --> 00:49:45.324]  They do.
[00:49:46.305 --> 00:49:47.185]  And then they say they don't.
[00:49:48.546 --> 00:49:51.908]  I don't think most women like the rape fantasy where they like getting their hair pulled and they like getting chugged.
[00:49:52.149 --> 00:49:53.690]  I don't think I've ever found one that doesn't.
[00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:54.690]  That's true.
[00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:55.491]  Where do you think that comes from?
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:58.148]  It's some type of evolutionary deal.
[00:49:59.915 --> 00:50:01.136]  I mean, you look at how whales mate.
[00:50:01.156 --> 00:50:02.716]  You know, a bunch of males chase the female.
[00:50:02.736 --> 00:50:04.417]  They're all battling each other and all the rest of it.
[00:50:04.457 --> 00:50:06.958]  And that's like survival of the fittest type stuff, I think.
[00:50:06.978 --> 00:50:07.759]  I haven't seen that.
[00:50:07.799 --> 00:50:08.819]  Whales.
[00:50:08.899 --> 00:50:09.419]  Oh, my God.
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:10.640]  I went to Hawaii once.
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:12.581]  You can see it in Hawaii and Maui.
[00:50:12.621 --> 00:50:13.421]  You see it in Porto Vallarta.
[00:50:13.441 --> 00:50:14.762]  It's the only place I've ever seen it there.
[00:50:14.782 --> 00:50:16.843]  I've heard about it with the gray whales and the humpbacks.
[00:50:17.383 --> 00:50:19.904]  And about 10 males chase the females, sometimes for a day or longer.
[00:50:19.924 --> 00:50:20.465]  Sometimes not.
[00:50:20.745 --> 00:50:22.446]  She'll stop the one she likes, but then they fight.
[00:50:22.826 --> 00:50:23.906]  Huge whales go into your boat.
[00:50:24.226 --> 00:50:24.947]  They hit each other.
[00:50:25.047 --> 00:50:25.807]  Blood sprays.
[00:50:25.847 --> 00:50:26.848]  They cut them.
[00:50:26.928 --> 00:50:27.508]  It's wild.
[00:50:27.588 --> 00:50:28.169]  You can watch that.
[00:50:28.329 --> 00:50:29.952]  You can go, I'm gonna... You can go watch that.
[00:50:30.312 --> 00:50:33.837]  You can watch it in Maui or, that's Lahaina, it's main tourism thing.
[00:50:34.118 --> 00:50:35.700]  Lahaina is well-watching.
[00:50:36.201 --> 00:50:37.923]  I've watched Wells twice in Lahaina.
[00:50:38.979 --> 00:50:41.760]  And one time I got there and it was like National Geographic and all these helicopters.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.641]  And they say, this is the best we've ever seen.
[00:50:43.661 --> 00:50:44.541]  There's like 50 whales.
[00:50:44.581 --> 00:50:45.102]  Get out there.
[00:50:45.402 --> 00:50:47.683]  We've only paid like 300 bucks for like two hours.
[00:50:48.263 --> 00:50:48.823]  So it was so good.
[00:50:48.843 --> 00:50:49.784]  We went back out again.
[00:50:49.824 --> 00:50:51.004]  There was marine biologists and everything.
[00:50:51.024 --> 00:50:53.145]  And they, you're not supposed to get by the whales, but he couldn't stop.
[00:50:53.185 --> 00:50:54.126]  They were going under the boat.
[00:50:54.746 --> 00:50:56.907]  I mean, it's huge, gigantic.
[00:50:57.547 --> 00:50:59.528]  And then, and then you see them like 50 yards away.
[00:50:59.968 --> 00:51:05.230]  The female stops and the males then just go boom into each other and out of the water and they're bleeding.
[00:51:05.451 --> 00:51:06.111]  I mean, it's wild.
[00:51:06.431 --> 00:51:07.372]  That sounds like a wild show.
[00:51:07.412 --> 00:51:11.434]  I saw this document here, the cannabis overuse linked to heart failure and heart attacks.
[00:51:11.454 --> 00:51:12.555]  Can you tell me about this?
[00:51:12.815 --> 00:51:14.076]  We're going to have to cover that next hour.
[00:51:14.096 --> 00:51:20.160]  We're going to break, do another couple more segments with us, because I want to get serious and move on from the choking, and we're going to play the video next hour, folks.
[00:51:22.397 --> 00:51:26.759]  There's claiming, oh, global warming causes heart attacks in young people, oh, marijuana causes heart attacks.
[00:51:27.259 --> 00:51:32.020]  It's all baloney, and I'm not defending that marijuana can't cause some problems or cause some schizophrenia and overuse.
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:32.980]  The studies are there.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:46.024]  I talked about it years ago and got made fun of, and people now know it's true in major studies, but it's the shots that are doing it, and so they're trying to just basically say, oh, global warming, oh, marijuana, oh, slipping on a banana peel, that's what's causing it.
[00:51:46.305 --> 00:51:47.265]  But no, it's the shots.
[00:51:48.163 --> 00:51:48.403]  All right.
[00:51:48.423 --> 00:51:50.746]  Yeah, I thought I was like, well, I'm double down then.
[00:51:50.986 --> 00:51:53.109]  Well, I've got a, are you, are you a pot smoker?
[00:51:53.449 --> 00:51:53.809]  A little bit.
[00:51:53.849 --> 00:51:54.130]  Yeah.
[00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:54.890]  Yeah.
[00:51:56.252 --> 00:51:58.835]  In my child custody battle, they go, how many times you smart marijuana?
[00:51:58.855 --> 00:51:59.736]  And I said about once a year.
[00:52:01.217 --> 00:52:04.781]  And that's because Joe Rogan, you know, uh, he didn't even smoke a lot of pot these days.
[00:52:04.801 --> 00:52:06.223]  Like he used to, but he's always got the best.
[00:52:08.328 --> 00:52:09.169]  The different strains.
[00:52:09.189 --> 00:52:10.890]  Some of it makes you depressed or paranoid.
[00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:15.573]  I never really get paranoid or scared, but I get scared when I smoke pot sometimes.
[00:52:15.593 --> 00:52:16.933]  They can be like my truth serum.
[00:52:17.013 --> 00:52:18.494]  I start getting all anxiety filled.
[00:52:18.775 --> 00:52:20.215]  If it's the wrong strain, I'm not an expert.
[00:52:20.716 --> 00:52:22.957]  But I love CBD oil, and it's good for pain.
[00:52:23.017 --> 00:52:24.358]  I bet you probably take it.
[00:52:25.239 --> 00:52:26.679]  My body's pretty healthy, luckily.
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:27.060]  Luckily.
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:29.861]  I will sometimes take an edible, but I usually take it too far.
[00:52:29.881 --> 00:52:32.003]  Those can go off the deep end with those a bit.
[00:52:32.697 --> 00:52:35.978]  Yeah, one time in college, I was not even a pot smoker then.
[00:52:35.998 --> 00:52:37.639]  Somebody said, oh, don't worry, you'll love this brownie.
[00:52:38.619 --> 00:52:40.880]  And I ate a brownie and couldn't get out of the chair for about five hours.
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:46.201]  And then one time, Joey Diaz at UFC Fights in Houston said, eat this cookie.
[00:52:46.321 --> 00:52:47.122]  Oh, it's not strong.
[00:52:47.802 --> 00:52:48.382]  And I ate it.
[00:52:48.422 --> 00:52:51.663]  He goes, oh, man, that's like whatever megados.
[00:52:52.063 --> 00:52:57.245]  And I, again, because they were doing all the pre-fights and stuff, I could not get out of the chair for like six, seven hours.
[00:52:57.725 --> 00:52:58.366]  It's a paralysis.
[00:52:58.406 --> 00:52:59.828]  And he was sitting next to me laughing at me.
[00:52:59.908 --> 00:53:00.669]  I was like, man.
[00:53:00.689 --> 00:53:01.630]  He can eat it.
[00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:02.431]  He can handle it, right?
[00:53:02.912 --> 00:53:03.793]  Man, it was unbelievable.
[00:53:03.813 --> 00:53:04.974]  All right, we'll be right back.

[00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:39.591]  All right, we're into hour number two.
[00:54:41.803 --> 00:54:47.786]  Craig Jones is a real character and very talkative and hilarious, but he kind of clams up once he's on air with us.
[00:54:48.846 --> 00:54:50.207]  But he definitely choked me out yesterday.
[00:54:50.227 --> 00:54:53.168]  So we're going to premiere that video coming up next segment.
[00:54:53.188 --> 00:54:58.371]  Some stations don't carry this segment, but I wanted to get your take just real quick on impeachment of Joe Biden.
[00:54:58.391 --> 00:54:59.811]  I mean, I know you're not an American citizen.
[00:54:59.831 --> 00:55:03.693]  You're here fleeing Australian tyranny out of the fire, into the frying pan.
[00:55:03.713 --> 00:55:05.454]  But I mean, what do you think of Joe Biden?
[00:55:06.212 --> 00:55:10.154]  Man, honestly, I've been too lazy to be keeping up with politics a lot lately.
[00:55:10.834 --> 00:55:14.536]  Well, too busy doing other shit, but I really have no idea.
[00:55:14.576 --> 00:55:15.677]  Well, you keep up with this show.
[00:55:15.697 --> 00:55:16.557]  You text me and stuff.
[00:55:16.797 --> 00:55:17.398]  News articles.
[00:55:17.898 --> 00:55:18.718]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:19.479 --> 00:55:22.080]  I mean, I'm too retarded to understand what's going on.
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:22.701]  You know what I mean?
[00:55:23.541 --> 00:55:24.301]  No, you're not.
[00:55:24.321 --> 00:55:25.242]  That's why I've come here.
[00:55:25.502 --> 00:55:26.643]  For you to educate me.
[00:55:26.803 --> 00:55:27.603]  Oh, yeah, right.
[00:55:28.884 --> 00:55:30.465]  You're the expert at choking people out.
[00:55:31.365 --> 00:55:31.585]  Me?
[00:55:32.706 --> 00:55:33.626]  That's all I can do, though.
[00:55:34.126 --> 00:55:35.167]  I went pretty quick, didn't I?
[00:55:36.328 --> 00:55:37.128]  Yeah, you went quick.
[00:55:37.329 --> 00:55:38.889]  You went quick, but you took a while to come back.
[00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:39.529]  Really?
[00:55:39.709 --> 00:55:42.070]  Yeah, 10 seconds, 10 seconds.
[00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:43.651]  Man, it's a funny video.
[00:55:43.911 --> 00:55:44.391]  Wow.
[00:55:44.611 --> 00:55:49.793]  All right, we're going to play this Jim Jordan beginning of the impeachment clip.
[00:55:50.193 --> 00:55:51.853]  Gotta break, reset, get into this.
[00:55:52.073 --> 00:55:55.194]  But I want to get into Joe Biden saying, trust him, take the new shot.
[00:55:55.235 --> 00:55:55.755]  That's coming up.
[00:55:56.035 --> 00:55:56.535]  First, this clip.
[00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:59.211]  This is a tale as old as time.
[00:55:59.912 --> 00:56:05.535]  Politician takes action that makes money for his family and then he tries to conceal it.
[00:56:06.136 --> 00:56:07.877]  Never forget four fundamental facts.
[00:56:08.457 --> 00:56:10.479]  Hunter Biden gets put on the board of Burisma.
[00:56:10.839 --> 00:56:11.980]  Gets paid a lot of money.
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:15.122]  Hunter Biden's not qualified, fact number two, to sit on the board.
[00:56:15.382 --> 00:56:16.843]  Not my words, his words.
[00:56:16.883 --> 00:56:19.304]  He said he got on the board because of the brand, because of the name.
[00:56:19.725 --> 00:56:26.487]   Fact number three, the executives at Burisma ask Hunter Biden to weigh in and help them with the pressure they are under
[00:56:26.487 --> 00:56:29.066]  from the prosecutor in Ukraine.
[00:56:29.066 --> 00:56:35.306]   Fact number four, Joe Biden goes to Ukraine on December 9, 2015, gives the speech attacking
[00:56:35.306 --> 00:56:39.746]   the prosecutor that starts the process of getting that guy fired.
[00:56:39.746 --> 00:56:44.426]   Those facts, by the way, are consistent with what the confidential human source told the
[00:56:44.426 --> 00:56:48.106]  FBI and the FBI recorded in the 1023 form.
[00:56:48.528 --> 00:56:52.709]  The same form that the Justice Department didn't want to let this committee see.
[00:56:53.590 --> 00:57:03.633]  And all those facts, all of that was further confirmed yesterday with the information that the Ways and Means Committee released from the whistleblowers Shapley and Ziegler.
[00:57:04.346 --> 00:57:07.690]  Here's a communication from Hunter Biden to an executive with Burisma.
[00:57:08.071 --> 00:57:14.919]  Devin and I do feel comfortable with Blue Star strategies and the ability of Sally and Karen to deliver.
[00:57:15.831 --> 00:57:19.294]  Hunter Biden put Burisma in touch with Blue Star Strategies.
[00:57:19.514 --> 00:57:21.115]  What were they going to deliver?
[00:57:21.736 --> 00:57:24.198]  Well, that was in a communication release yesterday as well.
[00:57:24.558 --> 00:57:24.838]  U.S.
[00:57:24.898 --> 00:57:39.510]  officials in Ukraine and in the United States need to express support for Burisma and Nikolai Zelensky to the highest level decision makers, the President of Ukraine, the President's Chief of Staff, and the Prosecutor General.
[00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:41.451]  That's what they were going to deliver.
[00:57:41.551 --> 00:57:43.153]  And were they successful?
[00:57:45.287 --> 00:57:49.009]  The Interior Minister confirmed that Zolotchevsky is no longer wanted.
[00:57:49.389 --> 00:57:50.990]  We won in less than a year.
[00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:58.273]  Communications between the folks at Blue Star and Eric Sherwin, who was Hunter Biden's business partner.
[00:57:58.453 --> 00:57:59.013]  Awesome work.
[00:57:59.074 --> 00:58:00.514]  Congratulations to you guys.
[00:58:00.554 --> 00:58:01.695]  Those are the communications.
[00:58:02.035 --> 00:58:03.115]  That's what they got done.
[00:58:03.756 --> 00:58:10.279]  And remember, when this happens in October 2016, when the pressure is taken off, the case is dropped against Zolotchevsky.
[00:58:11.328 --> 00:58:12.990]  This is the second prosecutor.
[00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:15.052]  Joe Biden fired the first one.
[00:58:15.132 --> 00:58:18.076]  The second prosecutor comes in, drops the charges.
[00:58:18.617 --> 00:58:20.339]  That's exactly what they want to done.
[00:58:21.516 --> 00:58:27.683]  And the final step, the final step is the Biden Justice Department tries to sweep it all under the rug.
[00:58:28.263 --> 00:58:30.025]  They slow walk the investigation.
[00:58:30.426 --> 00:58:37.574]  They let the statute of limitations lapse for the most important years, 14 and 15, the burisma years when all that income's coming in.
[00:58:38.114 --> 00:58:41.198]  They try to put together this sweetheart deal and get it past the judge.
[00:58:42.645 --> 00:58:53.336]  And we learned yesterday in the search warrant examining Hunter Biden's electronic communications, they weren't allowed to ask about political figure one.
[00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:57.581]  Political figure number one is the big guy, is Joe Biden.
[00:59:00.179 --> 00:59:01.540]  And they would have gotten away with it all.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:09.886]  They would have gotten away with it all, except for two brave whistleblowers who sat in those seats two months ago and told their story.
[00:59:10.386 --> 00:59:11.727]  And their story has stood up.
[00:59:12.147 --> 00:59:16.150]  Two brave whistleblowers and a judge in Delaware who said, we're not going to let this happen.
[00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:17.971]  That's why we're here today.
[00:59:18.572 --> 00:59:22.374]  That's why this inquiry is so darn important.
[00:59:22.715 --> 00:59:25.977]  It's the oldest story in the world, and those are the facts.
[00:59:29.218 --> 00:59:33.780]  Well, he's reportedly, and I've known him for years, the top MMA grappler in the world.
[00:59:34.821 --> 00:59:37.302]  At least people like Eddie Bravo and Joe Rogan agree that that's the case.
[00:59:37.322 --> 00:59:40.223]  But he calls himself El Segundo, or number two.
[00:59:40.343 --> 00:59:47.886]  Craig Jones got hurt by the Pfizer shot, had the courage like two and a half years ago to speak out against it, couldn't go back to Australia because of the lockdowns.
[00:59:47.926 --> 00:59:49.067]  I know they just kicked the premiere out.
[00:59:49.087 --> 00:59:50.888]  People are celebrating about that.
[00:59:50.948 --> 00:59:53.449]  Australia was used as the model of that tyranny.
[00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:57.711]  And now Joe Biden has come out and said, just trust us.
[00:59:58.371 --> 01:00:00.252]  Don't, you know, criticize us.
[01:00:00.292 --> 01:00:01.793]  Don't say you don't need the shot.
[01:00:02.133 --> 01:00:03.554]  But they admit the shot didn't work.
[01:00:03.614 --> 01:00:04.715]  It erases your immune system.
[01:00:05.055 --> 01:00:06.196]  It causes myocarditis.
[01:00:06.216 --> 01:00:06.977]  They covered it up.
[01:00:07.457 --> 01:00:09.218]  This is a big problem for them, Mr. Jones.
[01:00:10.038 --> 01:00:13.841]  Yeah, I mean, I would love to blame the shot for my terrible conditioning in the sport of Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:00:13.861 --> 01:00:15.822]  I think it must have done something to me.
[01:00:16.042 --> 01:00:18.184]  For sure, my gas tank is absolutely terrible.
[01:00:18.924 --> 01:00:20.005]  Could that have affected it?
[01:00:20.625 --> 01:00:23.247]  Did your gas tank get smaller after the shot?
[01:00:24.932 --> 01:00:25.413]  I think so.
[01:00:25.853 --> 01:00:27.975]  It's always been pretty bad, but I think probably worse after.
[01:00:28.816 --> 01:00:29.056]  Really?
[01:00:29.537 --> 01:00:31.939]  Well, I've watched some of your matches in person and online.
[01:00:31.959 --> 01:00:33.621]  They don't look like you run out of gas too much.
[01:00:33.941 --> 01:00:34.862]  Don't you almost always win?
[01:00:36.043 --> 01:00:37.064]  Most of the time, I come second.
[01:00:37.084 --> 01:00:38.305]  That's what we do at El Segundo.
[01:00:38.586 --> 01:00:40.187]  We just claim second place.
[01:00:40.207 --> 01:00:44.832]  Like I was telling you yesterday, it's like if you claim you're number two in the world, nobody will argue with you.
[01:00:44.852 --> 01:00:46.594]  They only argue with the guy claiming he's number one.
[01:00:48.573 --> 01:00:49.134]  I agree with that.
[01:00:49.214 --> 01:00:57.882]  Tucker Carlson is now numero uno, Joe Rogan is El Segundo, and I'm third place, which is a good place to be.
[01:00:57.902 --> 01:01:03.488]  Because I was number one in 2016-17, and man, CIA came after me, everybody.
[01:01:03.728 --> 01:01:06.110]  It's like the gunslinger that's the best, everybody wants to gun him.
[01:01:06.631 --> 01:01:07.672]  Everybody wants to have a duel.
[01:01:08.523 --> 01:01:12.266]  How, when you were number one of the top, how many, what do they call it, honeypots?
[01:01:12.286 --> 01:01:14.607]  How many times did people try to trap you into stuff?
[01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:20.511]  You know, I've been very blessed that I did not cheat on my ex-wife when I was with her 13 years.
[01:01:20.791 --> 01:01:29.217]  And then I got a little wild when my divorce first started, dated a lot, ran into my current wife about six months into the divorce and been with her ever since.
[01:01:30.138 --> 01:01:37.983]  And so, yeah, I mean, when you're famous, I'm sure it happens to you, you're famous and a good looking guy, women, you know, come up to you and want to be with you.
[01:01:38.884 --> 01:01:41.866]  But I mean, I'm satisfied with my wife, so I've been very, very blessed.
[01:01:41.886 --> 01:01:45.589]  Somebody like Andrew Tate, or somebody like Russell Brand.
[01:01:45.629 --> 01:01:52.134]  I mean, I've been to dinner with him, I've hung out with him, I've gone to his... I mean, women literally, like Elvis Presley, I've never seen him, literally throw themselves at him.
[01:01:52.735 --> 01:01:53.735]  Like, throw themselves.
[01:01:54.816 --> 01:02:00.521]  And so, he admits he used to be a sex addict, thousands of women, so they're going to find some mental patients that are going to make something up.
[01:02:00.981 --> 01:02:04.444]  So that's why it's good to be married, especially when you're famous.
[01:02:04.764 --> 01:02:05.546]  Very, very dismal.
[01:02:05.566 --> 01:02:07.471]  So, Russell Brand, what do you think is going to happen with that?
[01:02:07.492 --> 01:02:09.938]  He's moved completely off YouTube to, what, Rumble now?
[01:02:10.546 --> 01:02:11.787]  Yeah, I mean, he's totally innocent.
[01:02:11.867 --> 01:02:13.088]  I mean, statute of limitations.
[01:02:13.168 --> 01:02:18.692]  Women claim he was rough with them and, well, they weren't sure if it was right, but he pushed himself on them after they'd had sex with him.
[01:02:19.273 --> 01:02:22.235]  And it's 16 years later, and he can't even remember back that far.
[01:02:22.255 --> 01:02:23.536]  That's why there's a statute of limitations.
[01:02:23.576 --> 01:02:24.597]  He doesn't have his alibis.
[01:02:24.877 --> 01:02:26.638]  He doesn't have his witnesses, because they didn't charge him then.
[01:02:27.019 --> 01:02:27.479]  I wouldn't remember.
[01:02:27.499 --> 01:02:34.244]  If some woman accused me of something from 16 years ago, I mean, A, I was not, I was married and I was not, you know, cheating on my wife.
[01:02:34.464 --> 01:02:37.066]  And B, I wouldn't remember, you know?
[01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:38.848]  Yeah, well, are they going to charge him?
[01:02:38.868 --> 01:02:40.289]  Are they going to charge him with anything?
[01:02:41.573 --> 01:02:42.434]  I mean, I'll be quite frank.
[01:02:42.614 --> 01:02:48.078]  I'm not trying to brag or anything because I'm not super promiscuous, but I mean, I was pretty wild when the divorce first started.
[01:02:48.819 --> 01:02:51.481]  And I've been sitting in a restaurant and a girl walks over, hey, remember me?
[01:02:51.521 --> 01:02:54.803]  And I'm, you know, I couldn't imagine Russell Brand.
[01:02:54.823 --> 01:02:55.704]  I mean, how is he to remember this?
[01:02:55.724 --> 01:02:58.186]  You know, that sounds like a Willie Nelson party.
[01:02:59.287 --> 01:02:59.587]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:59.627 --> 01:03:04.731]  Willie Nelson's quite the I've never partied with Willie Nelson, but I know I have partied with him, but I've never partied with him.
[01:03:04.751 --> 01:03:07.233]  But I hear he's quite the quite quite the man's man.
[01:03:07.453 --> 01:03:10.075]  You miss the what was the party in Hawaii you were telling me?
[01:03:10.768 --> 01:03:14.012]  He did invite me to a party in Hawaii on his private jet and I didn't go.
[01:03:14.032 --> 01:03:17.435]  And then later I learned it was wild.
[01:03:17.576 --> 01:03:19.438]  So I knew some folks who went to it, yeah.
[01:03:19.698 --> 01:03:20.339]  You missed the party?
[01:03:20.359 --> 01:03:22.421]  A week-long party in Maui at his mansion.
[01:03:22.681 --> 01:03:26.085]  But at least you got the saliva of the... of the... what was it?
[01:03:26.125 --> 01:03:26.906]  The volcano?
[01:03:27.166 --> 01:03:27.547]  That's right.
[01:03:28.747 --> 01:03:32.089]  That's a gross story, and I told it because your podcast is funny and fun.
[01:03:32.489 --> 01:03:33.490]  Not for this audience.
[01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:36.552]  No, I mean, I've never had a man's saliva in my mouth.
[01:03:36.572 --> 01:04:06.805]   I don't know, playing football, and I wasn't very good at football, I guess people's like blood and sweat flies in your face, but I've never, no, Willie Nelson, and I'm not a big pot smoker, but when you're with Willie Nelson, he's smoking, he has these, before I'd never really seen vapes, this was like 15 years ago, I'm at his house, we're playing chess, Jesse Ventura was there that time, I've been to his house a few times, and Ventura can attest to this, It's like there's a nozzle with a ball on the end of it, and Nelson's like, the right stuff, where they're blowing the ball to hold the balls up.
[01:04:06.825 --> 01:04:09.287]  He just keeps sucking and sucking the smoke in.
[01:04:09.307 --> 01:04:10.628]  I don't know how he's doing it.
[01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:13.211]  And then he just goes, your turn.
[01:04:13.431 --> 01:04:14.632]  And there's that, you know.
[01:04:14.652 --> 01:04:17.214]  And I'm like, it's Willie Nelson.
[01:04:17.254 --> 01:04:17.915]  I went ahead and did it.
[01:04:17.935 --> 01:04:21.639]  So Willie Nelson's the only man saliva I've ever had in my mouth.
[01:04:22.239 --> 01:04:23.161]  That's true, too.
[01:04:23.181 --> 01:04:24.664]  Can you make this up?
[01:04:24.804 --> 01:04:25.625]  The first and last.
[01:04:26.106 --> 01:04:26.988]  The first and last.
[01:04:27.629 --> 01:04:30.094]  It was like a peace pipe or something, you know what I mean?
[01:04:30.134 --> 01:04:33.961]  It's like a rite of passage, I guess, but he looked at me.
[01:04:35.049 --> 01:04:38.670]  And we'd already smoked like two joints at his little Western town.
[01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:41.210]  He's got all these old churches and saloons down to his property.
[01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:42.651]  He shoots Westerns there, he used to.
[01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:47.892]  So we get there, hang out like three or four hours, smoke pot, eat some food, go feed his horses, go in there.
[01:04:47.912 --> 01:04:48.872]  And I've been to his house before.
[01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:51.052]  We go, he starts playing chess, Ventura's there.
[01:04:51.072 --> 01:04:53.553]  And we're too stoned to even do the interview.
[01:04:53.573 --> 01:04:55.433]  There's a cameraman there, but he's too stoned.
[01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:57.434]  And he's making him smoke.
[01:04:58.014 --> 01:04:58.834]  And we just sit there.
[01:04:59.294 --> 01:05:04.415]  And then, like I said, we were so stoned when we left, because we were going to one of his shows that night.
[01:05:05.049 --> 01:05:08.012]  Me and Ventura sat there for an hour in the parking lot just in the car.
[01:05:08.812 --> 01:05:09.413]  Couldn't even talk.
[01:05:10.334 --> 01:05:12.516]  So yeah, marijuana's a powerful, powerful drug.
[01:05:12.836 --> 01:05:13.817]  Yeah, it scares me too much.
[01:05:13.837 --> 01:05:16.779]  We're promoting getting choked out, marijuana.
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:18.921]  It was not intentional.
[01:05:19.622 --> 01:05:20.863]  Mr. Jones, you're a bad influence.
[01:05:21.504 --> 01:05:23.125]  You're a bad influence on me sometimes.
[01:05:23.766 --> 01:05:25.447]  You're a bad influence getting me to tell all these stories.
[01:05:27.748 --> 01:05:29.409]  And it brought out a lot of other terrible stories.
[01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:30.911]  Oh my goodness.
[01:05:31.231 --> 01:05:32.132]  But let's get serious.
[01:05:32.152 --> 01:05:33.493]  Let's play this video.
[01:05:33.893 --> 01:05:36.675]  Biden tells people to stop questioning COVID shots.
[01:05:38.076 --> 01:05:42.200]  And then we're going to play some of what he previously said, how they work perfectly and they're wonderful.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:43.140]  Here it is.
[01:05:44.001 --> 01:05:54.790]  I also, it doesn't directly relate today, but Arthur and I talked a little bit about it earlier this morning, is that what leaders say matter.
[01:05:55.825 --> 01:05:59.747]  In terms of people's confidence in things they're not sure about.
[01:06:00.727 --> 01:06:11.411]  And one of those areas, you saw what happened with regard to the health crisis we had that cost us, lost well over a million people.
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:19.944]  As time began to move on, you had more and more voices saying, no, no, no, you don't need to get that shot.
[01:06:20.004 --> 01:06:22.645]  You don't need to be, you don't need to.
[01:06:23.926 --> 01:06:29.110]  And we have a new strain of COVID now and we have answers for it.
[01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:37.015]  But I just would urge those in public life and both political parties or no political party.
[01:06:37.671 --> 01:06:47.562]  To be cautious about the sometimes inflammatory things you say about this because people's lives are at stake.
[01:06:48.442 --> 01:06:53.207]  And the last piece was when I was vice president for a slightly different reason.
[01:06:53.708 --> 01:06:58.173]  I spent a lot of time going between rural areas and urban areas.
[01:07:00.103 --> 01:07:00.683]  You're okay.
[01:07:00.963 --> 01:07:04.146]  You're not gonna get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:11.391]  Now we know that the vaccines work well enough that the virus stops with every vaccinated person.
[01:07:12.551 --> 01:07:14.733]  A vaccinated person gets exposed to the virus.
[01:07:16.514 --> 01:07:18.336]  The virus does not infect them.
[01:07:18.436 --> 01:07:21.077]  The virus cannot then use that person to go in.
[01:07:21.498 --> 01:07:25.320]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[01:07:25.701 --> 01:07:27.382]  It will not help you this time around.
[01:07:28.843 --> 01:07:30.264]  So their stories keep changing.
[01:07:30.284 --> 01:07:31.245]  We have a side of it facts.
[01:07:31.265 --> 01:07:38.672]  We try to promote all the studies as experts, but say they actually erases your immune system, hurts you, causes blood clots and heart attacks, myocarditis and strokes.
[01:07:39.072 --> 01:07:41.474]  They then censor you, even though you're telling the truth, Craig Jones.
[01:07:42.375 --> 01:07:42.896]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:07:42.916 --> 01:07:43.957]  I mean, it's funny watching that, eh?
[01:07:43.997 --> 01:07:50.522]  I keep thinking to myself, if Hunter Biden's scared of the vaccine with what he's put in his body, that's a concerning thought for sure.
[01:07:51.443 --> 01:07:52.043]  Absolutely.
[01:07:52.863 --> 01:07:57.965]  Well, I guess it's time to set this up.
[01:07:58.005 --> 01:07:58.925]  This was not pre-planned.
[01:07:59.525 --> 01:08:02.306]  You called me a few days ago and said, can I come in and interview you?
[01:08:02.326 --> 01:08:03.466]  I said, sure, use my studio.
[01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:05.526]  We'll go ahead and tell the story of what happened yesterday.
[01:08:06.106 --> 01:08:06.446]  Oh, yes.
[01:08:06.527 --> 01:08:12.648]  I remember probably the most favorite episode for everyone on Rogan ever would be, what number was it?
[01:08:12.688 --> 01:08:12.968]  Was it 100 or 200?
[01:08:13.008 --> 01:08:13.248]  I forget.
[01:08:13.268 --> 01:08:15.169]  I've been on there four or five times.
[01:08:17.429 --> 01:08:18.890]  Yeah, it was that middle one.
[01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:24.613]  Yeah, and there was an iconic moment on there where you told Eddie to choke you out and Joe put an end to it.
[01:08:24.813 --> 01:08:25.273]  Yeah, he did.
[01:08:25.553 --> 01:08:32.036]  So then, when we set this podcast up the other day, as the podcast ended, you were like, come and choke me out.
[01:08:32.116 --> 01:08:35.138]  And I was, I hesitated a second, and then we dove straight into it.
[01:08:35.518 --> 01:08:40.540]  We put the choke on, you fell asleep pretty quick, but you stayed asleep for 10 to, I would say 10 to 15 seconds.
[01:08:41.781 --> 01:08:43.642]  But then you fought your way out of it.
[01:08:43.662 --> 01:08:45.103]  I would say you aggressively came to it.
[01:08:45.123 --> 01:08:46.104]  You couldn't be kept down.
[01:08:46.144 --> 01:08:47.025]  You couldn't be kept asleep.
[01:08:47.525 --> 01:08:48.366]  It was a powerful moment.
[01:08:48.446 --> 01:08:52.128]  All I know is I felt like euphoric and just like I was in a fight.
[01:08:52.168 --> 01:08:53.289]  I woke up and said, what did I do?
[01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:55.611]  Yeah, that was killing me.
[01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:56.551]  You didn't say what happened.
[01:08:56.611 --> 01:08:57.652]  You said, what did I do?
[01:08:57.672 --> 01:09:01.195]  I don't know what you were dreaming about under there, but was it just black?
[01:09:01.255 --> 01:09:01.935]  It just goes black.
[01:09:02.235 --> 01:09:02.896]  I don't remember.
[01:09:03.216 --> 01:09:05.678]  Some of the times I've been choked out, I would have like a weird dream.
[01:09:07.492 --> 01:09:11.194]  But, uh, I've never taken DMT, but it's almost described like that.
[01:09:11.774 --> 01:09:14.976]  What's the longest time when you have been choked out you've stayed asleep for?
[01:09:14.996 --> 01:09:15.776]  Do you remember?
[01:09:15.796 --> 01:09:19.878]  Well, I mean, I haven't done that since I was, like, 12 years old.
[01:09:20.318 --> 01:09:20.618]  Oh, yeah.
[01:09:20.758 --> 01:09:22.819]  Like I said, the girl across the street was, like, 16.
[01:09:22.939 --> 01:09:23.359]  She did it.
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:24.160]  And then...
[01:09:25.683 --> 01:09:30.727]  She did a couple times and then once she let me go and I like hit my nose and had a nosebleed after it.
[01:09:31.168 --> 01:09:31.728]  That wasn't fun.
[01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:32.529]  I said, I'm gonna stop there.
[01:09:32.549 --> 01:09:34.390]  And then other kids at school knew about it.
[01:09:35.131 --> 01:09:38.614]  And so I didn't, I didn't bring it to the school, but it became a controversy.
[01:09:38.654 --> 01:09:39.274]  We got in trouble.
[01:09:39.314 --> 01:09:39.855]  They called us in.
[01:09:40.075 --> 01:09:45.039]  It only went on for a few weeks, but it became a, the big thing, you know, out of the, out of the recess, you go eat lunch.
[01:09:45.059 --> 01:09:49.362]  We had 30 minutes out there at the, you know, in, in the, by the football stadium or whatever.
[01:09:50.384 --> 01:09:52.227]  Yeah, it's just weird.
[01:09:52.427 --> 01:09:56.494]  And then my dad choked me out once, like I said, whenever I was being a total jerk.
[01:09:56.935 --> 01:09:57.596]  And I deserved it.
[01:09:57.636 --> 01:09:58.718]  I'd get really mad.
[01:09:58.758 --> 01:09:59.579]  I was like 13.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.482]  We weren't eating dinner at the main...
[01:10:02.206 --> 01:10:06.206]   dinner room table, it was like we were eating dinner in the kitchen table.
[01:10:06.206 --> 01:10:07.706]  It wasn't that big of a table.
[01:10:07.706 --> 01:10:11.105]   And my mother, I was arguing and I wanted to go do something, I don't remember what it was,
[01:10:11.105 --> 01:10:16.305]   and my mom was yelling at me, she did that a lot, and I was like, "Screw this!" and flipped the table over.
[01:10:16.305 --> 01:10:20.404]   And my mom got really mad, 'cause like broke one of her grandmother's dishes.
[01:10:20.404 --> 01:10:21.904]  She's like, "My grandmother's dish!"
[01:10:22.059 --> 01:10:22.819]  She came and pushed me.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:23.340]  I pushed her.
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.761]  I remember my dad was like, boom, out.
[01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:27.322]  Like, boom, out.
[01:10:27.522 --> 01:10:29.424]  He did it so hard, blood vessels in my eyes.
[01:10:29.824 --> 01:10:31.045]  Oh, they choked you that hard?
[01:10:31.125 --> 01:10:32.786]  Yeah, he like, boom, I was just out.
[01:10:33.426 --> 01:10:35.647]  And so that happened.
[01:10:35.667 --> 01:10:36.988]  So that's the last time I've been choked out.
[01:10:37.629 --> 01:10:40.891]  I guess once I got piled over the ground, that kind of knocked me out for about a half second.
[01:10:42.176 --> 01:10:42.597]  Unconscious.
[01:10:42.937 --> 01:10:43.477]  Kind of not.
[01:10:43.537 --> 01:10:45.419]  It was more like, like stars.
[01:10:45.439 --> 01:10:47.320]  Kind of like that.
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:48.321]  Oh wow, yeah.
[01:10:48.841 --> 01:10:51.763]  I think being knocked out with impacts is definitely worse for the brown.
[01:10:51.823 --> 01:10:53.405]  I think getting choked out is pretty bad.
[01:10:53.425 --> 01:10:54.665]  Yeah, that's what they say.
[01:10:54.986 --> 01:11:01.430]  Well, like you see in cartoons and stuff when the anvil falls on Foghorn Leghorn's head or whatever, he sees stars.
[01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:05.994]  That's what I, the last time I got quasi knocked out it was like, it was like literally like stars.
[01:11:06.514 --> 01:11:07.254]  You get the jelly legs.
[01:11:07.274 --> 01:11:09.535]  I've had a few concussions where I'm seeing rainbows and stuff.
[01:11:09.655 --> 01:11:12.216]  Not sure what's going on, where I am.
[01:11:12.356 --> 01:11:15.238]  I've had other concussions where you see the rainbows, the frosting around the eyes.
[01:11:15.758 --> 01:11:17.218]  Very strange feeling.
[01:11:17.859 --> 01:11:18.779]  Indescribable, really.
[01:11:19.199 --> 01:11:22.300]  It's wild, but no one tries this at home and it's not good.
[01:11:23.181 --> 01:11:23.701]  It's not good.
[01:11:23.741 --> 01:11:26.342]  You know, Joe thinks I'm crazy and wild because of the brain injuries.
[01:11:26.962 --> 01:11:27.342]  Oh, really?
[01:11:27.402 --> 01:11:31.164]  Yeah, but if that's the case, you know, sometimes people get hit on the head and then come back and know a lot more stuff, you know.
[01:11:31.907 --> 01:11:33.028]  Yeah, that's for damn sure.
[01:11:33.528 --> 01:11:34.809]  We're kind of exploring this today.
[01:11:34.869 --> 01:11:35.870]  It's more of an interesting discussion.
[01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:37.451]  It's kind of refreshing to talk about something different.
[01:11:38.272 --> 01:11:40.734]  Yeah, something more relaxing, right?
[01:11:40.774 --> 01:11:44.957]  Choking out and smoking pot with Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura.
[01:11:45.177 --> 01:11:45.918]  That was a good time.
[01:11:46.058 --> 01:11:47.679]  Alex, I'm a Navy SEAL.
[01:11:48.099 --> 01:11:49.820]  I know how to smoke marijuana.
[01:11:50.261 --> 01:11:51.462]  Hey, what's Jesse like?
[01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:53.416]  He used to be really cool.
[01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:57.779]  I mean, he's, uh, now he's for Provax and... Just take the shot.
[01:11:57.939 --> 01:12:00.200]  Everyone should be made to take it, Alex.
[01:12:01.201 --> 01:12:03.082]  I notice you are buddies with Trump now.
[01:12:03.763 --> 01:12:05.224]  I'd like to come on and debate you.
[01:12:06.245 --> 01:12:06.585]  Really?
[01:12:08.266 --> 01:12:08.867]  I like Jesse.
[01:12:08.887 --> 01:12:11.929]  He's a nice guy, but he's a little bit of a... I don't know.
[01:12:12.009 --> 01:12:12.889]  I think people get old.
[01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:14.891]  I'm getting different as I get older.
[01:12:15.471 --> 01:12:17.433]  I mean, he said some really BS things.
[01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:19.214]  I'm not trying to attack him, but good lord.
[01:12:19.966 --> 01:12:20.767]  Yeah, what happened?
[01:12:20.787 --> 01:12:30.012]  He made TV shows with me about deadly vaccines, and it was all predicted that would come, and then all of a sudden he's like, everyone needs to take it.
[01:12:30.052 --> 01:12:31.853]  You need to be made to take it, Mr. Jones.
[01:12:32.053 --> 01:12:33.314]  Is he still in the media these days?
[01:12:33.414 --> 01:12:34.015]  Does he do anything?
[01:12:34.595 --> 01:12:35.155]  I don't think so.
[01:12:36.596 --> 01:12:37.797]  Hey, let's call Ventura.
[01:12:37.837 --> 01:12:38.397]  I got his number.
[01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:40.038]  I'm sure he still lives in the same place in Minnesota.
[01:12:40.839 --> 01:12:41.999]  Also live in the Baja.
[01:12:42.279 --> 01:12:42.720]  Hit him up.
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:44.981]  See if he wants to come to Bohemian Grove 2024 with us.
[01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:46.022]  Absolutely.
[01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:48.250]  All right, let's get serious here.
[01:12:48.730 --> 01:12:54.892]  Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, here is Craig Jones, top grappler in the world, choking out Pumpkinhead.
[01:12:55.593 --> 01:12:56.493]  He probably wouldn't do it.
[01:12:56.533 --> 01:12:57.133]  Come choke me out.
[01:12:57.894 --> 01:12:58.934]  Come on, come do it.
[01:12:59.294 --> 01:12:59.934]  Wide shot.
[01:13:03.436 --> 01:13:03.896]  Here we go.
[01:13:05.076 --> 01:13:06.317]  I'm going to lights out.
[01:13:06.337 --> 01:13:07.017]  Take a little sense.
[01:13:08.858 --> 01:13:09.718]  I put this up though.
[01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:10.819]  We're not fools.
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:13.340]  Hold your elbow.
[01:13:17.116 --> 01:13:17.656]  I'm done.
[01:13:17.676 --> 01:13:19.657]  What were you saying there?
[01:13:20.317 --> 01:13:21.498]  I said I'm done.
[01:13:21.578 --> 01:13:22.778]  I was tapping out.
[01:13:22.838 --> 01:13:30.682]  What?
[01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:37.004]  What'd I just do?
[01:13:40.085 --> 01:13:41.706]  What'd I just do?
[01:13:42.466 --> 01:13:43.347]  You asked me to check you out.
[01:13:43.367 --> 01:13:43.867]  You're back there.
[01:13:44.427 --> 01:13:45.488]  I would actually pass out?
[01:13:47.073 --> 01:13:47.293]  Huh?
[01:13:47.933 --> 01:13:48.273]  Yeah.
[01:13:48.913 --> 01:13:49.634]  I did pass out?
[01:13:50.274 --> 01:13:52.234]  Yeah.
[01:13:55.695 --> 01:13:56.295]  Yeah, there.
[01:13:59.356 --> 01:14:00.456]  Sound like Donald Duck.
[01:14:01.536 --> 01:14:05.537]  Hey guys, when we upload this to Man Up Video later, let's do the other angle they said.
[01:14:05.677 --> 01:14:07.078]  Straight on, they said you can see right in my eyes.
[01:14:08.718 --> 01:14:08.878]  What?
[01:14:12.847 --> 01:14:15.309]  Great, I'm told there's one more clip they gave us that's straight on.
[01:14:15.329 --> 01:14:17.591]  Let's get that clip and play it before this live segment ends.
[01:14:17.951 --> 01:14:19.632]  And again folks, we didn't intend to do this.
[01:14:19.692 --> 01:14:22.594]  I was just thinking, I think in the podcast you brought up the Andy Bravo thing.
[01:14:22.614 --> 01:14:23.515]  I think that's how this came up.
[01:14:23.595 --> 01:14:24.696]  Oh yeah, we started with it, yeah.
[01:14:25.076 --> 01:14:27.578]  Yeah, so I was like, well why don't you do it since we didn't follow through on it.
[01:14:28.178 --> 01:14:31.941]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's such an iconic moment in the Rogan Podcast.
[01:14:31.961 --> 01:14:33.642]  That's one of the funniest clips I've ever seen.
[01:14:34.883 --> 01:14:35.684]  Saying, don't be pussies.
[01:14:39.382 --> 01:14:42.804]  I was a wimp at the end, because when I started to go, I was like, actually, I don't like this.
[01:14:43.164 --> 01:14:45.065]  So if you listen to me, I'm like, I'm done.
[01:14:45.185 --> 01:14:45.645]  I'm done.
[01:14:46.026 --> 01:14:46.686]  Yeah, I could not.
[01:14:46.706 --> 01:14:47.366]  No, I understand.
[01:14:47.386 --> 01:14:48.467]  Well, I sound like Donald Duck.
[01:14:48.847 --> 01:14:49.827]  Yeah, it was a different.
[01:14:49.968 --> 01:14:54.450]  When you started putting the squeeze, man, I was like, it's almost like you do this professionally or something.
[01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:56.591]  Yeah, yeah, I guess so.
[01:14:56.631 --> 01:14:58.952]  Hey, but I mean, you said you were using about three percent of your power.
[01:14:58.972 --> 01:14:59.732]  You're just like slowly.
[01:15:00.533 --> 01:15:02.554]  I felt your bicep.
[01:15:02.674 --> 01:15:05.455]  I put I put it on slow just to be safe because you put it on too high.
[01:15:05.475 --> 01:15:07.036]  Sometimes it hurts the hurts the neck.
[01:15:07.056 --> 01:15:08.517]  You know, you've got to be pretty gentle with it.
[01:15:10.026 --> 01:15:13.548]  Yeah, that is... Yeah, I felt you right away start to slowly squeeze.
[01:15:13.568 --> 01:15:14.429]  It was like a bulging stretcher.
[01:15:14.449 --> 01:15:16.230]  It was like... I was like, whoa, no.
[01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:21.573]  Yeah, because if you do it in a competition or something, and you squeeze too hard, too quick, your arms get tired.
[01:15:22.453 --> 01:15:22.933]  You know what I mean?
[01:15:22.953 --> 01:15:28.417]  So you might... Actually, in a competition, sometimes you got to hold on to it for like a minute until they tap out or something.
[01:15:28.437 --> 01:15:29.697]  And that's because they know how to tense their neck.
[01:15:29.717 --> 01:15:30.718]  And like, what do they do?
[01:15:30.898 --> 01:15:32.719]  Yeah, flexing it, tuck their chin in.
[01:15:32.859 --> 01:15:34.960]  Sometimes they put their chin in, you have to choke them over the chin.
[01:15:35.621 --> 01:15:35.861]  Really?
[01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:39.213]  So you use the jaw to choke him?
[01:15:39.033 --> 01:15:43.792]   Yeah, it's almost like, I call it sleep apnea, it's like pulling the chin back onto the throat.
[01:15:43.792 --> 01:15:49.353]   But yeah, a bunch of different ways to do it, but yeah, definitely don't try it at home.
[01:15:49.353 --> 01:15:52.273]  So what's the longest you put somebody under before?
[01:15:52.273 --> 01:15:54.613]  For me, nothing too crazy.
[01:15:54.881 --> 01:15:56.242]  Nothing over 10, 15 seconds.
[01:15:56.482 --> 01:15:57.803]  I've seen it in competition one time.
[01:15:57.883 --> 01:16:02.607]  I saw it where a guy got choked and the referee didn't know the opponent was unconscious.
[01:16:02.627 --> 01:16:08.271]  Because sometimes there's weird submissions where it's like, it might be a choke, but you don't know it's a choke unless you're experienced.
[01:16:08.732 --> 01:16:14.263]   So if that guy goes unconscious and the referee doesn't recognize it, The guy can hold the choke on for a long time.
[01:16:14.283 --> 01:16:17.405]  So I remember one time a guy was sleeping for over a minute and I was like, oh shit, is this guy dead?
[01:16:18.166 --> 01:16:20.187]  But that was the fault of the referee for sure.
[01:16:20.947 --> 01:16:21.968]  Referee should recognize it.
[01:16:22.168 --> 01:16:25.010]  They'll move your arm around, see if you're limp or if you're tense.
[01:16:25.911 --> 01:16:29.433]  Well, because you kept going, which would take about three to four minutes to kill somebody, right?
[01:16:30.333 --> 01:16:31.034]  I believe so.
[01:16:31.054 --> 01:16:36.057]  I believe there's a difference if it's like, if it's closing the throat or closing the carotid arteries.
[01:16:37.878 --> 01:16:39.399]  I think killing's quicker with the carotids.
[01:16:39.779 --> 01:16:40.639]  Yeah, I think that's great.
[01:16:40.659 --> 01:16:42.080]  I think that's 45 seconds or so.
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.140]  If you hold that on, you're done.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:46.401]  But I think with the throat, it takes a bit longer.
[01:16:46.421 --> 01:16:47.122]  A bit longer.
[01:16:47.882 --> 01:16:51.864]  Yeah, because you've still got air pumping through your heart, but that cuts the brain completely off the carotids.
[01:16:52.404 --> 01:16:53.064]  Yeah, straight away.
[01:16:53.104 --> 01:16:53.684]  Straight away.
[01:16:53.704 --> 01:16:55.225]  Hey look, we found some footage of us shooting.
[01:16:56.545 --> 01:16:57.746]  I'm dressed like a Russian here.
[01:16:59.093 --> 01:16:59.493]  That's it.
[01:16:59.513 --> 01:17:00.333]  You gotta go to prison.
[01:17:00.353 --> 01:17:01.114]  You're a Russian agent.
[01:17:02.014 --> 01:17:02.854]  Let's roll some more of it.
[01:17:02.894 --> 01:17:03.794]  Just keep B-rolling this.
[01:17:04.375 --> 01:17:08.396]  In fact, let's just... Let's let you shoot in the MP5.
[01:17:08.436 --> 01:17:09.236]  That's a sweet shooter.
[01:17:09.256 --> 01:17:11.497]  Oh, that's... Let's get me off the screen, please.
[01:17:12.297 --> 01:17:13.757]  Anyways, roll some of this with audio, guys.
[01:17:13.777 --> 01:17:14.097]  Go ahead.
[01:17:14.877 --> 01:17:16.458]  I think this clip's just from my Instagram.
[01:17:17.218 --> 01:17:17.518]  Oh, okay.
[01:17:17.538 --> 01:17:19.699]  We've got like hours of it in air, and we can't find it.
[01:17:20.359 --> 01:17:22.040]  What's your favorite weapon?
[01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:23.440]  The MP5 was awesome to shoot.
[01:17:24.877 --> 01:17:30.877]   You know, they should be a sponsor because I saw a lot of them for them, but those staccato 9mm are just like laser
[01:17:30.877 --> 01:17:30.877]  beams.
[01:17:30.877 --> 01:17:34.877]   I can shoot bullseye at 100 yards. I can hit little bitty metal targets all day long.
[01:17:34.877 --> 01:17:38.877]   Like I said, I can shoot 200 yards with that and hit like a 6-inch pattern without paying attention.
[01:17:38.877 --> 01:17:40.877]  How often do you go shooting?
[01:17:40.877 --> 01:17:44.877]  I haven't been shooting in probably 6 months.
[01:17:45.106 --> 01:17:45.426]  Oh, wow.
[01:17:45.586 --> 01:18:04.816]  I don't really go shooting very often, but with guns that good, I mean, it's... I go out and shoot with military guys, special ops guys, I shoot every week, and they're a little bit better because they do it all the time, but with guns that good, once you know how to do them, I mean, it's like, just, you know... I mean, with one of those handguns, a guy's a hundred yards away, you just relax and shoot him right between the eyes.
[01:18:04.836 --> 01:18:05.536]  I mean, it's just like...
[01:18:06.684 --> 01:18:07.064]  That's awesome.
[01:18:07.084 --> 01:18:08.265]  As long as you relax, they're dead.
[01:18:08.445 --> 01:18:10.466]  I've got to try and make a 100 yard shot one of these days.
[01:18:10.846 --> 01:18:11.267]  You did!
[01:18:11.307 --> 01:18:12.327]  You were shooting better than we were!
[01:18:12.347 --> 01:18:13.688]  You were shooting bullseye with the .50 cal.
[01:18:13.988 --> 01:18:15.569]  I'm not good with those Barrett .50 cals.
[01:18:15.609 --> 01:18:16.350]  You were nailing it.
[01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:18.431]  That was a scary gun to shoot.
[01:18:18.651 --> 01:18:19.191]  It clacks.
[01:18:21.593 --> 01:18:24.975]  All those shows like Police Academy and stuff, the woman shoots the .45 and it blows them back.
[01:18:25.135 --> 01:18:26.636]  There's almost no kick on handguns.
[01:18:27.116 --> 01:18:29.377]  Like I said, if it wasn't .500, that hurts your wrist.
[01:18:29.417 --> 01:18:30.518]  That's the biggest handgun there is.
[01:18:30.998 --> 01:18:31.758]  But those are a joke.
[01:18:31.779 --> 01:18:32.459]  They're nothing compared to...
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:39.444]  Yeah, 50 cals and stuff, there's definitely, it's not even the push, it's the clack.
[01:18:39.664 --> 01:18:41.346]  It'll give you a headache.
[01:18:41.706 --> 01:18:42.427]  Yeah, that's awesome.
[01:18:42.987 --> 01:18:45.890]  Well, you said the 50 cal was just like an anti-aircraft weapon, right?
[01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:48.792]  It's mainly an anti-equipment weapon.
[01:18:49.673 --> 01:18:52.115]  So it's meant to shoot armored vehicles and trucks.
[01:18:52.836 --> 01:18:54.377]  It's not a personnel weapon.
[01:18:54.717 --> 01:18:58.420]  Yeah, I remember when we were setting up to shoot, you were like, hey, move the car away from the target.
[01:18:59.815 --> 01:19:01.877]  We were parked by it, we were like, get that out of the way.
[01:19:01.897 --> 01:19:02.598]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:08.083]  I think your guy there was telling me you just need to shoot near somebody and it'll still do a ton of damage, you don't even need to hit him.
[01:19:10.065 --> 01:19:21.475]  I know that I've missed, um, like, uh, sand targets and stuff, you know, like a little bag of sand, and just the pressure of it's actually opened the bag up, yeah.
[01:19:21.775 --> 01:19:22.216]  Oh, really?
[01:19:22.716 --> 01:19:26.121]   Yeah, but I'm not a, I'm not a, um, What do you call it?
[01:19:26.141 --> 01:19:28.203]  I'm not a ballistics expert.
[01:19:28.223 --> 01:19:28.884]  I'm far from it.
[01:19:29.305 --> 01:19:32.488]  When I was a teenager and a kid, we went, we had a, we were still at the ranch.
[01:19:32.929 --> 01:19:34.751]  My dad and dad was like two hours from Dallas.
[01:19:34.871 --> 01:19:36.313]  And so we would go there like every other week.
[01:19:36.734 --> 01:19:40.078]  We spent like three or four weeks a year there total, you know, just a whole weeks at a time.
[01:19:40.098 --> 01:19:40.959]  And I would just shoot the whole time.
[01:19:40.979 --> 01:19:47.272]   So that was a great shot when I was like, When I was about 12 years old, I could shoot a squirrel
[01:19:47.272 --> 01:19:51.391]   open sights with a .22 every time in the head at 100 yards in a tree.
[01:19:51.391 --> 01:19:57.632]   I could shoot a deer running with a .30-06, 200-300 yards away, running, just no problem,
[01:19:57.632 --> 01:19:58.632]  every time.
[01:19:58.632 --> 01:20:02.231]  I never missed ducks, almost never missed dove, quail.
[01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:05.952]   And now I'm about, now I'm horrible compared to the way I was.
[01:20:06.407 --> 01:20:06.627]  Really?
[01:20:06.647 --> 01:20:08.529]  You're so young and trying to learn how to use a gun.
[01:20:08.589 --> 01:20:09.190]  It's unbelievable.
[01:20:09.710 --> 01:20:11.232]  We couldn't do it growing up in Australia.
[01:20:11.252 --> 01:20:11.932]  We didn't have any guns.
[01:20:12.413 --> 01:20:17.217]  Even when we went to the shooting range, they were locked into the holster so you couldn't turn them away from the target.
[01:20:17.998 --> 01:20:19.179]  Pretty boring way to shoot, really.
[01:20:19.879 --> 01:20:22.061]  And then they killed the real Crocodile Dundee.
[01:20:22.992 --> 01:20:23.832]  Yes, yes.
[01:20:23.973 --> 01:20:25.774]  The guy he was based on was really that guy.
[01:20:26.194 --> 01:20:28.955]  Wrestled crocodiles, everything, and they came to his house, took his guns, they killed him.
[01:20:29.275 --> 01:20:30.156]  Or he killed, like, three of them.
[01:20:30.396 --> 01:20:30.996]  Yeah, that was wild.
[01:20:31.436 --> 01:20:39.261]  The story was based off, he went on a hunting trip, and his boat got destroyed, and no one knew he was out there, and he had to survive in crocodile-infested water.
[01:20:39.861 --> 01:20:42.022]  And, like, he walked a great distance.
[01:20:42.082 --> 01:20:43.383]  I think he survived for six weeks out there.
[01:20:43.463 --> 01:20:45.204]  He looked just like the actor, hold on, y'all.
[01:20:45.224 --> 01:20:47.425]  There was an NRA magazine article about him, so I know about it.
[01:20:47.685 --> 01:20:50.006]  Yeah, and he didn't even... We should dig that up and redo a story about him.
[01:20:50.306 --> 01:20:53.467]  I think they didn't even, uh, he didn't get any money for the movie rights or anything.
[01:20:54.827 --> 01:20:57.488]  What is the best website for folks to find you guys?
[01:20:57.888 --> 01:21:00.909]  You have your great Jiu-Jitsu team, B-Team Jiu-Jitsu?
[01:21:01.649 --> 01:21:04.710]  Oh, yeah, just like El Segundo, number two, B-Team, number two team.
[01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:06.670]  So, uh, that way you can find that on YouTube.
[01:21:07.491 --> 01:21:09.151]  And when's this podcast weekly gonna come out?
[01:21:09.191 --> 01:21:09.531]  Next week?
[01:21:10.111 --> 01:21:10.912]  Yeah, I reckon next week.
[01:21:10.952 --> 01:21:12.032]  We'll have it out next week for sure.
[01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:15.169]  All right, Craig Jones, we really appreciate you.
[01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:18.750]  Thanks for going easy on me, and it's going to be a viral clip.
[01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:19.311]  Very interesting.
[01:21:19.831 --> 01:21:20.311]  For sure.
[01:21:20.331 --> 01:21:21.251]  Next time, you chug me out.
[01:21:22.072 --> 01:21:22.352]  No.
[01:21:22.372 --> 01:21:23.792]  Do you want me to chug you out?
[01:21:24.513 --> 01:21:25.213]  Or at least Freddy.
[01:21:25.233 --> 01:21:26.093]  We'll get Freddy up here.
[01:21:27.054 --> 01:21:28.034]  Hold on.
[01:21:28.054 --> 01:21:28.814]  You want to be chugged out?
[01:21:28.835 --> 01:21:29.535]  That'll be viral.
[01:21:29.715 --> 01:21:31.636]  No, I don't want to.
[01:21:31.676 --> 01:21:32.796]  You get me too excited, you know?
[01:21:34.837 --> 01:21:36.938]  You want me to come back and chug you out?
[01:21:36.958 --> 01:21:37.638]  Next episode.
[01:21:38.038 --> 01:21:39.219]  While Mike Lindell watches.
[01:21:40.461 --> 01:21:42.962]  Next time I come back to InfoWars, you can put me on.
[01:21:43.082 --> 01:21:44.123]  No, I don't want to do that.
[01:21:44.163 --> 01:21:45.123]  I don't want to have no desires.
[01:21:46.624 --> 01:21:47.204]  I don't want to do that.
[01:21:47.905 --> 01:21:49.486]  Now, Henry Kissinger, that's another subject.
[01:21:50.186 --> 01:21:51.347]  Oh, we'll wait until you're back.
[01:21:51.367 --> 01:21:53.068]  We're going to date him.
[01:21:54.028 --> 01:21:54.608]  The Bohemian Rope.
[01:21:54.628 --> 01:21:55.949]  It's a two-man job, for sure.
[01:21:56.449 --> 01:21:58.170]  Alright, Craig Jones, thank you so much.
[01:21:59.271 --> 01:22:00.631]  Great meeting the rest of your crew, too.
[01:22:00.651 --> 01:22:01.612]  Let's go hang out soon.
[01:22:02.112 --> 01:22:03.693]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:22:03.733 --> 01:22:05.394]  InfoWars.com, Mike Lindell coming up.
[01:22:06.403 --> 01:22:20.032]  In my first book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, I gave you a full analysis of the global elite's international conspiracy to enslave humanity and all life on the planet.
[01:22:20.333 --> 01:22:31.040]   The Great Reset is a planned attempt to redistribute all the world's wealth and power into the hands of banks, Corporations, billionaires, and the World Economic Forum.
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:37.885]  The only way this corporate fascist conspiracy can succeed is if the people of the world are not aware of it.
[01:22:38.566 --> 01:22:42.508]  For years, we've been laying out their sinister blueprint on Infowars.
[01:22:42.849 --> 01:22:55.078]  What we are witnessing is nothing less than the failed plans of social Darwinists to capture free market capitalism and turn it toward their fascist aims of controlling and depopulating the globe.
[01:22:55.738 --> 01:23:10.195]  Because of the tremendous success of the first book, which received tens of thousands of orders before it was even released, we're releasing a second book, The Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[01:23:10.655 --> 01:23:19.082]  The people the globalists fear the most are the members of their own systems of control who wake up and then decide to act against the machine.
[01:23:19.102 --> 01:23:23.925]  The globalists believe they've planned for every possible contingency.
[01:23:23.946 --> 01:23:30.030]  They hadn't counted on the conscience and love of truth, which lives in the souls of good people.
[01:23:30.451 --> 01:23:35.535]  Order the Great Awakening now to support Infowars and defeat the globalists.
[01:23:36.215 --> 01:23:55.665]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the Obama administration, Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son, Hunter, to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption, an event that Donald Trump looked into, sparking the first impeachment, enforcing the arming of Ukraine, in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[01:23:55.985 --> 01:24:21.779]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had, but that they swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign, all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents, despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016, when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[01:24:22.259 --> 01:24:23.480]  Do I have that all straight?
[01:24:25.925 --> 01:24:26.686]  Mostly, yeah.
[01:24:27.426 --> 01:24:28.126]  Which is troubling.
[01:24:28.146 --> 01:24:40.154]  Alright, for the balance of the hour, the great Mike Lindell, a champion of liberty in the globalist face and under attack joins us to cover his view on the...
[01:24:41.411 --> 01:24:48.340]  Debates last night, the default judgment by the judge in New York against Trump to start trying to take his property, saying he's guilty.
[01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:51.164]  I mean, this is an insane time to be alive.
[01:24:51.685 --> 01:24:53.127]  Please remember, we're listeners supported.

[01:25:54.003 --> 01:25:54.964]  Rated the strongest.

[01:26:08.092 --> 01:26:09.173]  Alright, Mike Lindell.
[01:26:10.358 --> 01:26:13.797]   has had a lot of developments in his ongoing fight against election fraud.
[01:26:13.797 --> 01:26:17.478]   They've demonized him, they've attacked him, but the majority of Americans know it happened.
[01:26:17.478 --> 01:26:22.277]   Now the evidence is coming out, but now Hillary's saying there may be election fraud again,
[01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:27.237]   because they know Trump's about to win by a landslide. What an insane time to be alive.
[01:26:27.237 --> 01:26:29.237]  Mike Lindell, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:26:29.237 --> 01:26:31.637]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:26:31.637 --> 01:26:36.837]   You're doing so much over at Frank's Speech, reaching millions of people.
[01:26:37.066 --> 01:26:39.751]  I've got a lot of questions, but we were talking via text a few days ago.
[01:26:39.791 --> 01:26:40.874]  You've got some big developments.
[01:26:41.575 --> 01:26:50.123]   Yeah, we've had, well at my pillow, You know they took away our American Express, they basically cancelled us.
[01:26:50.143 --> 01:26:52.645]  They took us from a million dollars down to a hundred thousand.
[01:26:53.226 --> 01:26:55.368]  All of our stuff runs off that.
[01:26:55.408 --> 01:27:01.134]  Our Facebook buys, our YouTube buys, I mean our Google buys, our shipping buys.
[01:27:01.475 --> 01:27:08.780]   So it basically overnight shut us down and their excuse was Well, we're doing it to a lot of companies now with the economy.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.581]  That was a blatant lie.
[01:27:10.881 --> 01:27:12.742]  And we've had to react to that.
[01:27:12.842 --> 01:27:14.723]  I've been in Minnesota now for two weeks.
[01:27:14.783 --> 01:27:21.805]  I went down to my factory yesterday to build up morale that these guys aren't worried about that we're going to collapse, completely collapse here.
[01:27:22.446 --> 01:27:25.707]  And they asked me, Alex, earlier, well, what's this all stem from?
[01:27:26.347 --> 01:27:31.689]  And what it is, is this spring, when they did, they did two things happen.
[01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:40.253]  When Fox News made the dirty deal with Dominion Voting System and paid them $787 million, that was on a Tuesday.
[01:27:40.413 --> 01:27:46.336]  On Wednesday, they came out and said, Mike Lindell loses $5 million because his evidence is no good.
[01:27:46.796 --> 01:27:47.577]  That's not true.
[01:27:47.637 --> 01:27:48.258]  That was a lie.
[01:27:48.278 --> 01:27:50.480]  We're not even in court till 2024.
[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:53.623]  And then on Friday, Fox News fires Tucker.
[01:27:54.003 --> 01:27:59.969]  When that happened, I had vendors get very nervous and banks get very nervous about my pill.
[01:28:00.230 --> 01:28:00.950]  They're calling me up.
[01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:03.633]  I'm going, no, that doesn't even go into court till next year.
[01:28:04.033 --> 01:28:06.256]  Well, then everybody knows what happened in June.
[01:28:06.836 --> 01:28:07.997]  Then I had this auction.
[01:28:08.037 --> 01:28:18.481]  My manager said, hey, let's have an auction to get rid of some of this equipment because the retailers have canceled us and we have some equipment we use in the retail to make the retail products.
[01:28:18.921 --> 01:28:20.002]  And I said, sure, go ahead.
[01:28:20.042 --> 01:28:25.845]  Well, I imagined a little auction where they go, you know, hello, you know, right in our in our factory here in Minnesota.
[01:28:26.305 --> 01:28:28.426]  Instead, it's a nationwide auction online.
[01:28:29.486 --> 01:28:31.487]  And of course, everybody knows what happens then.
[01:28:31.867 --> 01:28:34.889]  My pillow's going broke, they're selling off all their equipment.
[01:28:35.249 --> 01:28:39.811]  When that happened, my vendors got nervous, and it's just been ongoing.
[01:28:39.871 --> 01:28:42.913]  Now, they all got nervous, I had to settle them down again.
[01:28:43.313 --> 01:28:49.636]   Well, then when American Express did this two weeks ago, Alex, It's vendor after vendor I've had to meet with.
[01:28:49.896 --> 01:28:51.596]  They want to pull in their credit lines.
[01:28:51.876 --> 01:28:54.437]  Instead of having, I'll give you an example.
[01:28:54.497 --> 01:28:55.557]  I'm one towel company.
[01:28:55.577 --> 01:28:59.738]  Instead of having 90 days, they want to do it 30 days.
[01:28:59.838 --> 01:29:03.818]  Instead of a sheet company, instead of 120, you have 60 days.
[01:29:04.098 --> 01:29:07.139]  Well, you're basically collapsing a whole company.
[01:29:07.539 --> 01:29:12.801]   So I've had to meet with each individual vendor and give them peace of mind saying, We're here to stay.
[01:29:12.861 --> 01:29:17.225]  If you do this, you do collapse us like American Express is trying to do.
[01:29:17.245 --> 01:29:21.569]  It's just terrible, terrible attacks.
[01:29:21.589 --> 01:29:22.610]  Let's expand on that.
[01:29:22.630 --> 01:29:26.835]  They don't want me to get into it, but we just got debanked again last week.
[01:29:27.461 --> 01:29:28.161]  It's the same story.
[01:29:28.181 --> 01:29:34.383]  When we declared bankruptcy for reorganization, which is a chapter 11, sub-chapter 5, they went out and said we were going under a year ago.
[01:29:34.403 --> 01:29:35.284]  None of that was true.
[01:29:35.744 --> 01:29:37.384]  This is how they're whispered campaigns.
[01:29:37.424 --> 01:29:45.907]  That's why they did this to the nation on a national scale, saying America's not open for business because of the fake environmental regulations and all the controls.
[01:29:46.248 --> 01:29:50.769]  Trump comes in and says we're open again, and overnight we're the energy exporter of the world.
[01:29:51.149 --> 01:29:52.750]  Overnight we're the greatest energy exporter.
[01:29:52.850 --> 01:29:57.170]   overnight, the jobs and factories come back because people want to be here, they want
[01:29:57.170 --> 01:29:58.170]  to invest here.
[01:29:58.170 --> 01:30:00.769]   But under globalism, they said America's closed for business.
[01:30:00.769 --> 01:30:03.970]  Then they had lockdowns to try to stop what Trump was doing.
[01:30:03.970 --> 01:30:10.010]   So we're a microcosm, InfoWars and MyPillow, of what they're doing to everybody.
[01:30:10.010 --> 01:30:11.569]  And this is really their plan.
[01:30:11.569 --> 01:30:16.209]   And under their ESGs, their social credit scores, they want to make this permanent.
[01:30:16.209 --> 01:30:17.850]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:30:18.093 --> 01:30:19.615]  And you know what we're doing to fight back?
[01:30:19.975 --> 01:30:21.657]  We just put all our stuff on sale.
[01:30:22.157 --> 01:30:26.221]  You know, we've got the, I'll tell you, the MyPillow 2.0, everybody.
[01:30:26.262 --> 01:30:38.173]  I was down at my factory yesterday and just the smiles on their faces because they're still, they're making the pillows that they love to make and they, the MyPillow 2.0, we added that cooling technology.
[01:30:38.193 --> 01:30:40.476]  I invented MyPillow 20 years ago.
[01:30:41.076 --> 01:30:42.797]  And this is our 20-year anniversary.
[01:30:42.818 --> 01:30:45.119]  I hadn't changed it until now.
[01:30:45.179 --> 01:30:46.380]  This is a cooling thread.
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:47.521]  We made a fabric out of it.
[01:30:47.761 --> 01:30:50.503]  Because sleep is all about temperature and height.
[01:30:50.523 --> 01:30:52.445]  So you got the MyPillow 2.0.
[01:30:52.785 --> 01:30:53.405]  It adjusts.
[01:30:53.485 --> 01:30:55.227]  It gives you the best sleep in history.
[01:30:55.607 --> 01:30:56.808]  And you can get that at MyPillow.
[01:30:56.828 --> 01:31:00.511]  We're putting it on sale today for your show, Alex, using your promo code.

[01:31:01.931 --> 01:31:05.731]  $39.98 for the queen, a king just $5 more.
[01:31:05.731 --> 01:31:09.411]  We put all our slippers on sale for $39.99.

[01:31:24.731 --> 01:31:25.650]  We don't have middle men.
[01:31:25.650 --> 01:31:28.532]  We don't have the retail and the shopping channels.
[01:31:28.532 --> 01:31:30.451]  And there it is right there.
[01:31:30.451 --> 01:31:31.270]  Look at that.
[01:31:31.844 --> 01:31:35.467]  That $39.99 slipper is a six-piece towel set.
[01:31:35.807 --> 01:31:37.228]  There's the MyStore, too.

[01:31:47.236 --> 01:31:49.217]  There are actually almost, I think, thousands.

[01:31:55.582 --> 01:31:57.763]  here that make USA-made products.
[01:31:57.844 --> 01:31:58.864]  And Mike, let's be clear.
[01:31:59.505 --> 01:32:00.385]  Let's be clear about this.
[01:32:01.306 --> 01:32:02.447]  You said it five minutes ago.
[01:32:02.487 --> 01:32:03.647]  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:32:04.148 --> 01:32:05.349]  They say we're going under.
[01:32:05.409 --> 01:32:06.369]  They say you're going under.
[01:32:06.409 --> 01:32:09.191]  If people buy that leftist garbage, we will.
[01:32:09.251 --> 01:32:10.352]  They say Trump's done.
[01:32:10.712 --> 01:32:11.572]  We don't buy into it.
[01:32:11.592 --> 01:32:12.433]  He gets stronger.
[01:32:12.453 --> 01:32:13.373]  That's right.
[01:32:13.573 --> 01:32:16.555]  All they've got is their Wizard of Oz behind the curtain.
[01:32:17.036 --> 01:32:17.896]  You are Toto.
[01:32:18.116 --> 01:32:18.757]  I am Toto.
[01:32:19.477 --> 01:32:25.081]  We are pulling back the curtain on these people and people say, oh, stand up and fight.
[01:32:25.541 --> 01:32:28.423]  Well, members of Congress don't because they come after you when you do.
[01:32:28.723 --> 01:32:29.764]  They try to indict you.
[01:32:29.784 --> 01:32:30.524]  They try to destroy you.
[01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:31.505]  But you have courage.
[01:32:31.945 --> 01:32:32.486]  I have courage.
[01:32:32.546 --> 01:32:33.567]  Our audience has courage.
[01:32:33.927 --> 01:32:34.887]  They want us to fight.
[01:32:35.308 --> 01:32:36.889]  They wonder where are the men standing up.
[01:32:36.949 --> 01:32:44.574]  We're doing it as entrepreneurs, funding media organizations and funding the truth while selling high quality products.
[01:32:44.594 --> 01:32:45.775]  So it's everybody's duty.
[01:32:46.699 --> 01:32:51.578]   You've got incredibly high quality made in America products that are the lowest prices
[01:32:51.578 --> 01:32:52.578]  out there.
[01:32:52.578 --> 01:32:53.958]  I mean it really literally is.
[01:32:53.958 --> 01:32:59.319]   So you've got the greatest info that's matched by the great products.
[01:32:59.319 --> 01:33:06.238]   Everyone's got a birthday coming up or a christening coming up or a baby shower coming up or Christmas
[01:33:06.238 --> 01:33:07.238]  is just in a few months.
[01:33:07.587 --> 01:33:11.528]  Now is the time to support MyPillow, and then you support us as a sponsor.
[01:33:11.808 --> 01:33:16.449]  Go to MyPillow.com, get these products, give them as gifts, do it now.
[01:33:16.469 --> 01:33:17.929]  And yeah, we're coming to you asking for help.
[01:33:18.369 --> 01:33:19.610]  Imagine if we just walk away.
[01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:28.656]   Mike Lindell could have rolled over, And he was already a super strong entrepreneur, incredibly successful, but he decided to fight for the country because he didn't want to roll over.
[01:33:29.016 --> 01:33:42.186]  So we owe it to Mike Lindell and his employees and his crew, plus these are great products, to go there now and let the system know, you're trying to extinguish Mike Lindell, you're trying to silence this fighter, he'll never give up, he'll never give in, he'll never sell out, but he could give out.
[01:33:42.526 --> 01:33:52.795]   So literally, my pillow and the great work Mike's done and his great crew, It is in your hands, viewers and listeners, just like InfoWars, and it's up to you.
[01:33:52.915 --> 01:33:57.619]  Not George Soros, not Obama, not Biden, not the Rothschilds, not the New World Order.
[01:33:57.999 --> 01:33:59.080]  It's up to you.
[01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:05.085]  And we told them no on their poison shots, and now they try their new rollout of COVID lockdowns, and it's failing.
[01:34:05.505 --> 01:34:07.587]  It's failing because you said no.
[01:34:07.947 --> 01:34:09.609]  You say no to Disney.
[01:34:10.109 --> 01:34:11.270]  No to Anheuser-Busch.
[01:34:11.711 --> 01:34:12.552]  No to Bud Light.
[01:34:12.772 --> 01:34:18.958]  And you say yes to InfoWarsTore.com, and yes to MyPillow.com, and yes to MyStore.com promo.
[01:34:19.118 --> 01:34:20.180]  Alex, it's that simple.
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:21.381]  You want people to fight?
[01:34:21.621 --> 01:34:22.282]  We're doing it.
[01:34:22.382 --> 01:34:23.643]  I'm not bitching at listeners.
[01:34:24.023 --> 01:34:31.471]  I know times are tough out there, but we, Mike Lindell, Alex Jones, Donald Trump, we are at the heart of the fight.
[01:34:31.551 --> 01:34:32.092]  Mike Lindell.
[01:34:32.876 --> 01:34:33.997]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:34:34.117 --> 01:34:37.399]  And I was just watching as you scroll them products, everybody.
[01:34:37.759 --> 01:34:41.622]  Everybody, I reverse engineer products too and say, what are the problems?
[01:34:41.642 --> 01:34:45.545]  Well, one of the biggest problems we have with towels, they didn't really dry or they were too crisp.
[01:34:45.825 --> 01:34:49.687]  The new kitchen towels we have, these are soft and they absorb.
[01:34:50.068 --> 01:34:51.389]  All these colors came in.
[01:34:51.649 --> 01:34:55.932]  We have these, we have a very limited supply on these, but you can get them right now at 25%.
[01:34:56.092 --> 01:34:57.913]  I was just watching.
[01:34:58.113 --> 01:34:59.354]  We have over 250 products, everybody.
[01:35:01.175 --> 01:35:08.062]  If you go to the MyPillow.com backslash Alex there, you go there, there's one square I see there where it said 80% off.
[01:35:08.322 --> 01:35:09.683]  This is an overstock sale.
[01:35:10.003 --> 01:35:11.245]  Why are we doing that part?
[01:35:11.285 --> 01:35:12.986]  That's sleepwear, all kinds of stuff.
[01:35:13.286 --> 01:35:23.316]  That's to make room for more manufacturing and keep my employees employed, making the very successful MyPillow 2.0.
[01:35:24.857 --> 01:35:31.461]  And look at that, you get, look at that, Queens are the, Queens size closeout sheets, $49.98.
[01:35:31.541 --> 01:35:34.002]  These are all things that we were overstocking.
[01:35:34.022 --> 01:35:35.443]  I'm going to tell you a true story.
[01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:37.771]  This is about three months ago.
[01:35:37.851 --> 01:35:39.732]  My wife listens to the show some, but I don't blame her.
[01:35:39.752 --> 01:35:42.714]  She doesn't listen to it all, because it can be upsetting.
[01:35:43.415 --> 01:35:45.937]  And she literally, you know, asks me questions about, should we do this?
[01:35:45.957 --> 01:35:46.417]  Should we do that?
[01:35:46.437 --> 01:35:48.539]  And I always tell her, just do what you want, honey, on stuff like this.
[01:35:48.919 --> 01:35:51.161]  She goes, well, I want to get new sheets.
[01:35:51.641 --> 01:35:53.422]  We haven't had new sheets in five, six years.
[01:35:53.462 --> 01:35:54.803]  The sheets aren't soft anymore.
[01:35:55.263 --> 01:35:56.484]  And I don't like the towels.
[01:35:56.504 --> 01:35:57.665]  They've gotten, you know, hard.
[01:35:57.745 --> 01:36:00.267]   And I said, And she said, so where should we go?
[01:36:00.307 --> 01:36:01.368]  And I said, well, go wherever you want.
[01:36:01.388 --> 01:36:03.129]  But I said, why don't you go to MyPillow.com?
[01:36:03.569 --> 01:36:05.150]  You know, because we've ordered some before.
[01:36:05.190 --> 01:36:07.811]  You know, those those those those pillows and sheets we got that are so good.
[01:36:07.832 --> 01:36:10.633]  They're in the guest bedroom for that one order like four years ago.
[01:36:11.214 --> 01:36:12.134]  She said, oh, I forgot.
[01:36:12.174 --> 01:36:12.995]  Those are really good.
[01:36:13.355 --> 01:36:21.580]  So she's, I think, already yesterday going there to replace our sheets and our towels and stuff like that, because they literally are amazing.
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:25.082]  They literally are the best quality for the lowest price.
[01:36:25.382 --> 01:36:26.463]  And you're supporting freedom.
[01:36:29.343 --> 01:36:51.336]  I don't know, it's about a year, a year and a half ago, and he got some of the Giza Dream sheets, and he usually, you know, when we talk all the time, he would, unless he would bring, for him to bring them up, the first time he goes, Mike, those sheets, he goes, they're better than even, you know, the highest priced sheets he's ever slept on.
[01:36:51.597 --> 01:37:05.347]   He said this straight up in front of a whole bunch of people, and I'm going, and, uh, That made me feel pretty good because I did reverse engineer products to make them the best products ever and he was actually so much surprised, but it made a difference in his sleep.
[01:37:05.367 --> 01:37:07.969]  He goes, I couldn't believe sheets actually make a difference.
[01:37:09.230 --> 01:37:12.833]  But I'll tell you... Let me ask you this question because I know you reverse engineer things to make them better.
[01:37:14.267 --> 01:37:14.687]  It's true.
[01:37:14.748 --> 01:37:20.873]  If you get these acrylic towels that feel really soft and feel good, but it doesn't absorb the water.
[01:37:20.913 --> 01:37:26.177]  So if you get the old-fashioned, really rough towels, they absorb good, but they feel terrible on your skin.
[01:37:26.657 --> 01:37:30.140]  Your towels are slick and smooth, but absorb great.
[01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:30.781]  How did you do that?
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:32.500]  Yeah, well, here's what happened.
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.921]  That's the story behind the My Towels, everybody.
[01:37:35.701 --> 01:37:38.981]  I grew up, when I grew up, you're exactly right, Alex, the towels, they worked.
[01:37:39.001 --> 01:37:41.482]  They dried you, and I'm going, okay, what changed?
[01:37:41.562 --> 01:37:49.123]  All of a sudden, it seemed like something had changed over the last couple of decades, and where you, the towels, they feel slimy or lotion-y in the stores.
[01:37:49.143 --> 01:37:52.724]  You get them home, they feel it, you know, soft, but they get them home, and they don't absorb the water.
[01:37:52.744 --> 01:37:53.444]  It just beads off.
[01:37:53.464 --> 01:37:54.644]  You're going, they're not even dry me.
[01:37:55.044 --> 01:37:56.424]  Well, I checked into it.
[01:37:56.463 --> 01:38:03.302]   I did an investigation and in 2006, our government made deals with Pakistan, China,
[01:38:03.302 --> 01:38:08.783]   India and other countries overseas to not pay duty coming into the US on towels.
[01:38:08.783 --> 01:38:13.863]   So what happened was it became very competitive and they started adding fabric softeners
[01:38:13.863 --> 01:38:15.224]  and oils to the towels.
[01:38:15.224 --> 01:38:19.182]   So when you were in a box store and you felt it going, oh, that feels good, but you got them home
[01:38:19.182 --> 01:38:20.104]  and they didn't work.
[01:38:20.104 --> 01:38:26.342]   So I spent a year, about, well, about 10 months developing the towels with a company that we worked
[01:38:26.342 --> 01:38:27.182]  very hard on.
[01:38:27.182 --> 01:38:33.743]   They had new technology where they could get the softness, plus they could get, it would actually absorb.
[01:38:33.788 --> 01:38:43.217]  So I think in one of my commercials, we had a lot of fun making it, we took one of my towels, we poured water on it, and I don't have a water here, but we poured water, it absorbed right in.
[01:38:43.237 --> 01:38:45.619]  No, I've seen the ad, it totally absorbed and the other towel didn't absorb.
[01:38:46.690 --> 01:38:47.611]  Yeah, it didn't absorb.
[01:38:47.631 --> 01:38:52.293]  I go, you could line a swimming pool with this, and I believe you could with the other ones.
[01:38:52.533 --> 01:38:54.394]  But we put these, they're on sale, everybody.
[01:38:54.695 --> 01:38:57.936]  These are the best towels, a six-pack towel set for $39.98.
[01:38:58.036 --> 01:39:04.640]  This is the lowest price we've ever had on this, and it's amazing.
[01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:10.283]  Single towels that are crap at places like Bed Bath & Beyond that have kicked you out are like $25, $30 a piece.
[01:39:11.943 --> 01:39:38.360]  Yeah, yeah, and this is where, so what we've done, we've turned lemons into lemonade, we've taken all of our price, put them all on sale, where they keep attacking us, they take away all of our mailmen, they've took, I mean, they took out the mailmen because the box stores and the shopping shelves, but they've also now taken away our credit, so okay, so we've got to turn product faster, everybody, because we can't be the bank.
[01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:45.083]  Yeah, for folks that don't know, these big advertising places you advertise, they don't take checks.
[01:39:45.103 --> 01:39:45.783]  They don't want to.
[01:39:45.823 --> 01:39:46.663]  They don't even want wires.
[01:39:46.683 --> 01:39:47.924]  They want an American Express.
[01:39:47.964 --> 01:39:49.564]  We lost ours, too, during this.
[01:39:49.664 --> 01:39:53.086]  And so we used to put everything on that, and it just cripples you.
[01:39:53.446 --> 01:39:54.806]  So folks, we're not whining here.
[01:39:54.826 --> 01:39:55.306]  We're explaining.
[01:39:55.527 --> 01:40:00.849]  You know, it's come out, Mike, the CIA and Justice Department, with big think tanks, are running these attacks on us.
[01:40:00.869 --> 01:40:01.429]  You know that, right?
[01:40:02.698 --> 01:40:04.198]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:40:04.339 --> 01:40:11.460]  I believe what they did with American Express did, I believe, was a direct attack to keep Mike Lindell's voice silent.
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:18.162]  They don't want me to talk about, which we have, which by the way we're all doing over here, the plan to secure our elections.
[01:40:18.522 --> 01:40:20.002]  It's in full force, everybody.
[01:40:20.022 --> 01:40:20.823]  There's an update.
[01:40:21.143 --> 01:40:25.724]  We are working hard on that and we will have that by this fall.
[01:40:25.744 --> 01:40:34.828]   You're going to see a Proof of concept to the world about what we're doing in this fall's elections, and not just in Louisiana, Kentucky, and Mississippi where they have big ones.
[01:40:35.088 --> 01:40:36.569]  We're doing it all across our country.
[01:40:37.245 --> 01:40:44.809]  And by the line, Mike, if they're able to shut you down or shut me down, there'll be giant support after, but we won't have the infrastructure or the employees we'll have to rebuild.
[01:40:45.149 --> 01:40:48.451]  Don't make Mike prove how serious this is by them shutting him down.
[01:40:48.791 --> 01:40:52.473]  Don't let them shut down Infowars or put Trump in jail to show how serious it is.
[01:40:52.894 --> 01:40:57.476]  Our own reporter reports to jail on the 24th of October for trying to stop people going to the Capitol.
[01:40:57.776 --> 01:40:58.457]  This is real.
[01:40:58.497 --> 01:40:59.237]  We're not bitching.
[01:40:59.517 --> 01:41:02.519]  We're men stepping up to the plate, taking on the tyrants.
[01:41:02.799 --> 01:41:05.162]  But it takes money to win wars, so what do we do?
[01:41:05.442 --> 01:41:12.711]  We bring you books and films and t-shirts and towels and sheets of high quality and employ Americans and try to win-win and try to win this war.
[01:41:12.731 --> 01:41:14.653]  I mean, it's simple.
[01:41:14.673 --> 01:41:17.176]  Like, George Washington robbed British ships to fund himself.
[01:41:17.456 --> 01:41:18.357]  We're not out doing that.
[01:41:18.377 --> 01:41:20.139]  And, you know, George Washington, I support him.
[01:41:21.087 --> 01:41:22.968]  We're not robbing banks to fund this, folks.
[01:41:23.288 --> 01:41:24.509]  That's not Communist Fund stuff.
[01:41:24.789 --> 01:41:28.352]  We are selling high-quality, made-in-America products and fighting the tyrants.
[01:41:28.372 --> 01:41:38.158]  And that's why you're insane if you don't go to MyPillow.com forward slash Alex and use promo code Alex to get these discounts, because that supports Mike and his employees and Frank's speech and what he's doing with all his hosts.
[01:41:38.479 --> 01:41:42.521]  I was looking, Mike, you're reaching tens of millions of people a day with your hosts and your network.
[01:41:42.561 --> 01:41:43.202]  Congratulations.
[01:41:43.939 --> 01:41:44.679]  Well, thank you.
[01:41:44.919 --> 01:41:49.861]  And you guys, you see right there, the original MySlippers there that we have on sale for $39.98.
[01:41:51.181 --> 01:41:54.203]  When these came out, they were $89 or $100 and some dollars, actually.
[01:41:54.483 --> 01:41:59.965]  Everybody knows that other brand of slippers that's got, I think it's called Uggs or whatever.
[01:42:00.205 --> 01:42:02.926]  But we took them apart, we looked what was inside, and we looked at that.
[01:42:02.986 --> 01:42:04.126]  It's got the big brand name.
[01:42:04.446 --> 01:42:09.430]  Well, when I went to invent my pillow, or my slippers, not invent them, of course slippers are invented.
[01:42:09.450 --> 01:42:11.012]  I reverse engineered that too.
[01:42:11.392 --> 01:42:14.935]  If you took a MySlipper, I think in the commercial, we show what's inside here.
[01:42:15.235 --> 01:42:18.818]  There's something called impact gel, patented impact gel.
[01:42:18.919 --> 01:42:23.242]  It's made with soybeans, and when the guy came and demoed that to me, it was amazing.
[01:42:23.542 --> 01:42:27.982]   He put his hand down, put this impact show on top and hit it with the hand.
[01:42:27.982 --> 01:42:31.143]  But what it does, he did it on me too, it doesn't hurt.
[01:42:31.143 --> 01:42:33.742]  But what it does, it spreads your weight.
[01:42:33.742 --> 01:42:37.902]   So when you're on the slipper, I said, well, let's use this on slippers and we did.
[01:42:37.902 --> 01:42:40.902]  So that's in there, the MyPillow Patented Foam.
[01:42:40.902 --> 01:42:46.342]   These slippers are made, you can walk in my shoes all day long and not get fatigued.
[01:42:46.437 --> 01:42:53.139]  It was a reverse engineer, let's make a slipper that is better than any shoe in my opinion.
[01:42:53.219 --> 01:42:56.640]  I have so many, I know I did one show, Alex, when these first came out.
[01:42:57.001 --> 01:42:59.521]  There was about, I think it was 2,000 people there.
[01:42:59.581 --> 01:43:03.983]  I spoke at an event in Kentucky and I think everyone there had slippers.
[01:43:04.323 --> 01:43:07.144]  They're taking them off, look Mike, I'm wearing your slippers like shoes.
[01:43:07.464 --> 01:43:12.666]   You know, we have all these different All these different, the women's, men's, they're all in stock right now.
[01:43:13.006 --> 01:43:14.467]  We put them on sale early.
[01:43:14.887 --> 01:43:18.008]  For, and not on the website, these are on Alex's site.
[01:43:18.028 --> 01:43:21.110]  You're MyPillow.com backslash Alex.
[01:43:21.150 --> 01:43:22.290]  That's where you're gonna find them.
[01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:23.310]  Right there everybody.
[01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:26.092]  $39.98 everybody.
[01:43:26.112 --> 01:43:26.612]  There they are.
[01:43:26.972 --> 01:43:29.493]  The moccasins, the slip-ons, they're all there.
[01:43:29.833 --> 01:43:32.354]  They are going to run out when we run out.
[01:43:32.394 --> 01:43:41.784]   So all these products, because Like I said before, our vendors are squishing our credit lines after what America Express did to it.
[01:43:42.044 --> 01:43:53.057]  So we might not be able to buy more, you know, more product or get more components for the product because we can't be the bank unless we turn those products very fast.
[01:43:54.238 --> 01:43:58.879]  That's exactly what I've explained to Lister's and they kept us in that position for three years.
[01:43:58.919 --> 01:44:01.180]  We finally barely dug out of that.
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:02.840]  They're doing the same thing to you.
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:06.761]  They've got to back you now or it's in the Lister's hands.
[01:44:08.041 --> 01:44:12.522]  If you don't want Mike Lindell on the battlefield, you want the enemy to have a big victory, don't support him right now.
[01:44:12.622 --> 01:44:13.763]  Seriously.
[01:44:14.043 --> 01:44:14.603]  It's a guillotine.
[01:44:14.903 --> 01:44:16.543]  You don't go there, I'm not guilty of it.
[01:44:16.603 --> 01:44:17.064]  It's that simple.
[01:44:17.304 --> 01:44:19.404]  It's your decision in this war whether you want to win.
[01:44:19.624 --> 01:44:21.445]  It takes money to win a war, plus you get great products.
[01:44:21.685 --> 01:44:23.025]  MyPillow.com forward slash Alex.
[01:44:23.425 --> 01:44:25.105]  And I want to say one more thing.
[01:44:25.185 --> 01:44:33.867]  If you guys, if you watch TV, I'm not even going to name all the networks, you're going to see our ads right now drop substantially this week.
[01:44:33.927 --> 01:44:36.168]  This is also because of American Express.
[01:44:36.408 --> 01:44:42.569]  This was a manifestation that was, it was, we are in a very tough situation right now.
[01:44:43.049 --> 01:44:46.130]  We've been in a tough situation before, but this is one of the top three.
[01:44:46.670 --> 01:44:52.849]   And what these, by not being able to buy ads where we would out there too, 'cause I don't brand.
[01:44:52.849 --> 01:44:55.569]   Those, if they don't break even or make money, I can't buy 'em.
[01:44:55.569 --> 01:44:59.369]   But if you can't give 'em the money, if your credit's pulled there, you got problems there too.
[01:44:59.369 --> 01:45:05.849]   So what I've done, everybody, I'm counting on, like your show, Alex, for your listeners, my,
[01:45:05.849 --> 01:45:08.649]  that's why I actually reached out to you.
[01:45:08.649 --> 01:45:09.930]  I said, "Can you help us out?"
[01:45:09.930 --> 01:45:11.090]  And you said, "Absolutely."
[01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:12.930]  And I thank you so much for not getting rid of it.
[01:45:12.930 --> 01:45:14.489]  No, don't thank me, brother.
[01:45:15.498 --> 01:45:19.121]  Like Trump says, they're trying to get through you and I and Trump to get to them.
[01:45:19.521 --> 01:45:21.582]  They're cutting off our energy, imploding our borders.
[01:45:21.863 --> 01:45:22.883]  We're all under attack.
[01:45:23.144 --> 01:45:24.164]  We're just loyal men.
[01:45:24.204 --> 01:45:24.865]  We're not heroes.
[01:45:24.905 --> 01:45:26.886]  We're just men that aren't bowing to slavery.
[01:45:27.227 --> 01:45:28.608]  But we can't do it without the listeners.
[01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:31.111]  Right, that's exactly right.
[01:45:32.071 --> 01:45:42.535]  But they, like I said yesterday, I went down to my factory, I told everyone down there, I was coming on your show, I said, you guys, business is going to go up, watch, you know, and we're going to get through this.
[01:45:42.635 --> 01:45:48.578]  And all your prayers out there too, everybody, all your prayers.
[01:45:49.018 --> 01:45:57.702]   I will say one more thing, if you want to find out What we're doing out there with the plan to secure our elections, there are two parallel paths.
[01:45:57.962 --> 01:46:01.943]  You can go to LyndaleEvent.com and learn everything we're doing out there with the plan.
[01:46:02.504 --> 01:46:10.587]  And because, I'll tell you what everybody, any money that I manifest that comes through to me, I take that money and I do one thing.
[01:46:10.907 --> 01:46:12.488]  I go to secure our elections.
[01:46:12.568 --> 01:46:16.853]   I poured Mike, everybody knows you poured everything you've got into this fight.
[01:46:17.393 --> 01:46:20.013]  And so have I. And we just are all together on this.
[01:46:20.493 --> 01:46:21.773]  Please come on my other shows.
[01:46:21.793 --> 01:46:22.454]  They're big as well.
[01:46:22.514 --> 01:46:24.194]  Harrison Smith, Owen Schroer.
[01:46:24.234 --> 01:46:25.774]  Please come back with us again next week.
[01:46:26.174 --> 01:46:27.354]  The listeners are going to step up.
[01:46:27.434 --> 01:46:27.974]  We love them.
[01:46:27.994 --> 01:46:28.675]  We appreciate them.
[01:46:28.695 --> 01:46:29.275]  We're in this together.
[01:46:29.615 --> 01:46:30.875]  Mike Lindell, we salute you.

[01:47:29.135 --> 01:47:30.416]  I've been called a liar.
[01:47:31.156 --> 01:47:34.599]  I've been silenced on virtually every platform created by man.
[01:47:35.279 --> 01:47:37.601]  My life has been threatened, repeatedly.
[01:47:38.182 --> 01:47:40.764]  They've tried to destroy me, but I survived.

[01:48:27.785 --> 01:48:30.686]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas and U.S.
[01:48:30.726 --> 01:48:38.989]  resistance against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[01:48:39.469 --> 01:48:41.950]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[01:48:41.970 --> 01:48:43.710]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:45.671]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[01:48:45.911 --> 01:48:48.033]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[01:48:48.274 --> 01:48:49.335]  This is all confirmed.
[01:48:49.355 --> 01:48:50.296]  This is not a drill.
[01:48:50.456 --> 01:48:54.400]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[01:48:54.740 --> 01:48:56.142]  They've officially become state-run.
[01:48:56.282 --> 01:48:56.742]  Apple 100%.
[01:48:57.143 --> 01:49:02.769]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:07.991]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[01:49:08.291 --> 01:49:09.151]  This is happening.
[01:49:09.171 --> 01:49:17.094]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[01:49:17.194 --> 01:49:23.096]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[01:49:23.556 --> 01:49:31.519]  This is a titrated dose reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[01:49:32.379 --> 01:49:35.900]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:39.421]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[01:49:39.661 --> 01:49:46.783]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[01:49:46.983 --> 01:49:49.644]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.

[01:50:01.764 --> 01:50:05.423]   agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting
[01:50:05.423 --> 01:50:11.163]   to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Chai Comm/Big Tech banking combine emergency situation.
[01:50:11.242 --> 01:50:16.388]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[01:50:17.495 --> 01:50:26.243]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[01:50:26.263 --> 01:50:31.148]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[01:50:31.508 --> 01:50:36.413]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[01:50:36.633 --> 01:50:44.436]  And then they built me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[01:50:44.636 --> 01:50:51.659]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:57.482]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and is being used against you.
[01:50:57.722 --> 01:51:02.424]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[01:51:02.444 --> 01:51:04.445]  I have given you the transmission!
[01:51:09.319 --> 01:51:18.583]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:51:18.623 --> 01:51:21.124]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:51:21.225 --> 01:51:25.567]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:51:25.407 --> 01:51:35.407]  [MUSIC]
[01:51:35.407 --> 01:51:39.407]  Telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[01:51:39.407 --> 01:51:49.407]  [MUSIC]
[01:51:49.407 --> 01:51:50.407]  No BS.
[01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:51.681]  Everything's straight shooting here.
[01:51:51.721 --> 01:51:54.203]  See, I don't have some Mackey value in the middle of the view.
[01:51:54.243 --> 01:52:02.731]  Find Alex Jones and all of InfoWars, the most banned media outlet in the world, at Banned.Video.
[01:52:02.791 --> 01:52:05.053]  With me, it's all straightforward attack.
[01:52:04.873 --> 01:52:06.713]  It's all straightforward attack.
[01:52:06.713 --> 01:52:08.073]  That's the real power.
[01:52:08.073 --> 01:52:13.433]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[01:52:13.483 --> 01:52:17.449]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:21.476]  Join Bandot Video, and I will complete your training.
[01:52:21.796 --> 01:52:25.796]   Together, we can overthrow the Emperor and restore the Republic.
[01:52:25.796 --> 01:52:39.796]  [Music]
[01:52:39.796 --> 01:52:42.796]  All other networks lie to you about what's happening now.
[01:52:43.521 --> 01:52:45.903]  InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:52:47.224 --> 01:52:49.065]  The secrets of the universe.
[01:52:50.466 --> 01:52:51.186]  Consciousness.
[01:52:52.427 --> 01:52:54.427]  The mysteries of time.
[01:52:54.427 --> 01:53:05.507]   Alright, we're going to open the phones up in this third hour on any topic, any subject, any issue you want to raise,
[01:53:05.507 --> 01:53:09.427]   you disagree, you agree, just have a clean phone line, we're ready to talk to you.
[01:53:10.111 --> 01:53:11.632]  We're taking first-time callers again.
[01:53:13.052 --> 01:53:14.613]  There were three callers on hold when the show ended.
[01:53:14.633 --> 01:53:15.573]  I didn't have time to get to you.
[01:53:16.474 --> 01:53:17.474]  So I'm going to call you back.
[01:53:17.534 --> 01:53:20.255]  If you're able to answer, you'll go back to the front of the line, because I hate doing that.
[01:53:20.275 --> 01:53:24.197]  I've gotten really good about getting the callers when I do get them up on the board.
[01:53:24.757 --> 01:53:29.439]  We always get calls, but I mean, when I do take calls, I really am getting better at always getting to all of them.
[01:53:29.479 --> 01:53:33.541]  But when we don't, every few weeks, I'll miss the mark, and we call you back.
[01:53:34.181 --> 01:53:35.422]  So you'll go to the front of the line.
[01:53:35.962 --> 01:53:41.826]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:53:41.846 --> 01:53:45.529]  877-789-Alex.
[01:53:45.549 --> 01:53:46.229]  877-789-2539.
[01:53:48.170 --> 01:53:48.991]  Taking your phone calls.
[01:53:49.031 --> 01:53:54.715]  And I've got a lot of really informative, interesting news here that I'm going to hit right now while we're getting your calls lined up.
[01:53:54.755 --> 01:54:00.218]  But I want to just say something about Mike Lindell and myself and Trump and everybody else.
[01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:03.881]  Trump's out there every day asking for support.
[01:54:05.339 --> 01:54:09.422]  His net worth probably gone down 50% in this fight.
[01:54:09.742 --> 01:54:10.523]  He's putting his money in.
[01:54:12.104 --> 01:54:14.866]  They're now saying, oh, we find you guilty of fraud.
[01:54:14.906 --> 01:54:15.587]  The judge does.
[01:54:15.627 --> 01:54:16.127]  No jury.
[01:54:16.607 --> 01:54:19.530]  We're going to start taking your hotels and golf courses.
[01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:22.292]  That's all to create the illusion he's a loser.
[01:54:22.772 --> 01:54:27.175]  Oh, if the indictments didn't work and made him more popular, now we'll take his hotels and his golf courses.
[01:54:28.716 --> 01:54:30.258]  The globalists have a blind spot, folks.
[01:54:30.278 --> 01:54:31.959]  That's going to make people support Trump more.
[01:54:34.718 --> 01:54:36.279]  But he's got that big bully pulpit.
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:41.984]  People like Lindell and myself, we're seen as junior to Trump, which we are, in the resistance.
[01:54:42.004 --> 01:54:47.008]  But at the end of the day, whether Trump wins or loses or whatever, we're still going to try to be here to fight the tyranny.
[01:54:47.548 --> 01:54:51.651]  They can't get away with this whole agenda if we're here calling it out.
[01:54:53.993 --> 01:55:00.378]  And so, I hate coming on air and beating you over the head saying support us, plus get great products.
[01:55:01.079 --> 01:55:03.821]  But I hate something worse, and that's giving up and going off air.
[01:55:05.922 --> 01:55:14.507]  And so, I'm happy to do it, but I'm very thankful, and I'm very humble to all of you, but I'm just here to tell you, this isn't a game.
[01:55:15.687 --> 01:55:19.529]  And the fact that we're holding on, people go, well, they're alright, they're holding on.
[01:55:19.549 --> 01:55:21.010]  No, we're just holding on.
[01:55:22.371 --> 01:55:25.573]  And we need your word of mouth, your prayers, support now more than ever.
[01:55:25.993 --> 01:55:29.615]  This is a big, big deal, and every person fighting tyranny is precious.
[01:55:30.595 --> 01:55:33.177]  Every person standing up for what's right is amazing.
[01:55:33.997 --> 01:55:39.349]   But the prominent people, That are out there really taking on the Deep State head on.
[01:55:39.369 --> 01:55:47.611]  If they're able to take us out, they're going to be able to then move on to the next group, the next group.
[01:55:48.751 --> 01:55:50.732]  But they have it like in concentric rings.
[01:55:50.752 --> 01:55:54.753]  They're trying to take out the most informative, those that can rally the public the best.
[01:55:56.553 --> 01:55:59.154]  And if they can shut us down, they think they can shut you down.
[01:55:59.854 --> 01:56:01.855]  And so I am literally standing in their way.
[01:56:02.795 --> 01:56:04.276]  But you're standing in their way as well.
[01:56:04.316 --> 01:56:05.536]  We're standing together.
[01:56:07.125 --> 01:56:08.565]  But I've done my terse.
[01:56:09.006 --> 01:56:09.866]  I've done my time.
[01:56:11.426 --> 01:56:12.447]  And I don't want to quit.
[01:56:15.288 --> 01:56:20.329]  But a sick part of me has been in this fight so long, I'm like, well, I'm not going to give up.
[01:56:21.550 --> 01:56:23.630]  But if they shut me down, I didn't give up.
[01:56:23.710 --> 01:56:24.611]  But then that's a lie.
[01:56:24.631 --> 01:56:30.432]  If I fight hard enough, and if I push you hard enough, because I know you're good people, you'll keep me in the game.
[01:56:32.153 --> 01:56:34.874]  And so I can't quit pushing you, even though I don't like it.
[01:56:36.391 --> 01:56:41.515]  Because again, I hate giving up a lot worse than I do appear like a seal begging for a fish.
[01:56:43.156 --> 01:56:50.361]  But it's the regular, you know, hardcore listeners that support maybe 1-2% of listeners ever actually buy something.
[01:56:50.841 --> 01:56:53.103]  And I just say the other 98%, what are you doing?
[01:56:54.764 --> 01:57:02.099]   Because if you're not going to support me, That the enemy completely hates because we're very effective with the truth.
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:04.361]  Well, you better go do your own show.
[01:57:04.421 --> 01:57:06.062]  You better buy ads in the newspaper.
[01:57:06.102 --> 01:57:07.944]  You better be doing something.
[01:57:07.964 --> 01:57:08.884]  That's all I'm telling you.
[01:57:09.185 --> 01:57:16.710]  Because I don't know where you can bet your time, your energy, your money, your prayer, your psychic will more than this.
[01:57:17.391 --> 01:57:23.215]  And then all I do, other talk shows say to me that are like, you know, more business focused just on the money.
[01:57:24.176 --> 01:57:31.782]  Why do you have on all these other charities and groups and organizations, half the time you're not promoting your own money to fund your own self, you're promoting other people.
[01:57:31.822 --> 01:57:38.628]  Because those people are all an extension of me, I'm an extension of them.
[01:57:39.969 --> 01:57:44.073]  They put Trump in prison, that's a blow against everybody.
[01:57:44.513 --> 01:57:46.074]  Say what you want about him, the enemy's after him.
[01:57:46.895 --> 01:57:49.177]  They shut down Tucker Carlson, that's a defeat for all of us.
[01:57:49.557 --> 01:57:50.398]  Instead he's exploded.
[01:57:50.858 --> 01:57:52.580]  But only because Twitter's somewhat free.
[01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:56.071]  It's not perfect, but I'm thankful for what's free as it is.
[01:57:57.072 --> 01:57:59.694]  If they can shut down Mike Lindell, they really don't like him.
[01:58:00.415 --> 01:58:00.775]  Oh no.
[01:58:01.736 --> 01:58:03.658]  He's got thousands and thousands of employees.
[01:58:04.138 --> 01:58:06.540]  He runs around setting up networks for all these talk show hosts.
[01:58:06.860 --> 01:58:07.521]  It's breaking through.
[01:58:07.721 --> 01:58:08.722]  They don't like that, folks.
[01:58:09.563 --> 01:58:11.064]  They've raided him with the FBI.
[01:58:11.905 --> 01:58:13.086]  Most people piss themselves.
[01:58:14.147 --> 01:58:17.474]   So if you don't admire Warriors.
[01:58:18.034 --> 01:58:19.855]  This is the current war scape we're in.
[01:58:20.575 --> 01:58:23.076]  And people that persevere, and you don't back those people?
[01:58:23.796 --> 01:58:24.776]  They're the best we've got?
[01:58:25.537 --> 01:58:28.778]  If you can make fun of me, I'm goofy, so is Mike Wendell's goofy.
[01:58:29.198 --> 01:58:30.098]  That's why he's endearing.
[01:58:30.138 --> 01:58:31.038]  He's real, folks.
[01:58:31.078 --> 01:58:31.679]  He's a goofball.
[01:58:32.019 --> 01:58:33.959]  So am I. But we're men.
[01:58:34.319 --> 01:58:35.020]  We love freedom.
[01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:36.020]  We're not cowards.
[01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:37.460]  We don't know how to give up.
[01:58:38.901 --> 01:58:41.462]  We don't know how to back down, because it feels horrible to do that.
[01:58:42.042 --> 01:58:42.942]  These are bad people.
[01:58:43.922 --> 01:58:45.803]  But if you don't back us, okay.
[01:58:47.151 --> 01:58:48.312]  I told you the sick part of me.
[01:58:49.854 --> 01:58:51.455]  People notice I've been taking on more time.
[01:58:51.475 --> 01:58:58.162]  And it's because for 29 years on air, I would even work Christmas Day.
[01:58:59.423 --> 01:59:00.704]  I would even work on Thanksgiving.
[01:59:02.586 --> 01:59:05.188]  And it's like I'm in a time warp.
[01:59:05.228 --> 01:59:06.049]  My children grew up.
[01:59:06.249 --> 01:59:06.910]  Everything changed.
[01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:07.831]  I was an okay father.
[01:59:08.351 --> 01:59:09.392]  Didn't do as good as I could have.
[01:59:09.452 --> 01:59:09.953]  None of us have.
[01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:16.142]  And I just have sat back and said, well, all when I'm here, I'll work seven days a week.
[01:59:16.582 --> 01:59:18.123]  I was up here until midnight last night.
[01:59:18.143 --> 01:59:21.625]  There's a bunch of interviews, a bunch of shows, everything.
[01:59:21.645 --> 01:59:38.435]  So I'm going to work double hard when I'm here, but it's not giving up, but it's recognizing that everything is temporary.
[01:59:42.836 --> 01:59:44.376]  I'm just telling you my thought processes.
[01:59:45.717 --> 01:59:48.077]  My thought process and where I am.
[01:59:49.418 --> 01:59:58.160]  Because I don't have a feeling of victory or a feeling of exaltation or a feeling of exhilaration that we've been vindicated.
[01:59:58.340 --> 02:00:01.381]  I mean, I knew we'd be vindicated if we didn't stop this operation.
[02:00:03.081 --> 02:00:06.762]  And again, a slice of that is a little snapshot of that.
[02:00:06.782 --> 02:00:10.003]  A microcosm of that.
[02:00:11.034 --> 02:00:16.713]   is I knew five, six weeks ago with my whistleblowers that they were accurate, they were going to try the COVID rollout
[02:00:16.713 --> 02:00:17.034]  again.
[02:00:17.034 --> 02:00:21.434]   And I knew if we rallied against it, and I knew it was super unpopular, we had a good chance of stopping it.
[02:00:21.434 --> 02:00:28.314]   And we at least mitigated it, it'd be a big victory, that they would then turn around and say, "Oh, look,
[02:00:28.314 --> 02:00:35.595]   Jones said by the end of September, they'll be wearing masks at the TSA
[02:00:35.595 --> 02:00:38.154]   and they'll roll out a new shot and they'll roll out new
[02:00:38.154 --> 02:00:39.034]  protocols."
[02:00:39.225 --> 02:00:41.608]  And they've done a bunch of that, but part of it they've not.
[02:00:43.376 --> 02:00:46.258]  And I talked two days ago to my source, and they said, yeah, we were told it was coming.
[02:00:46.279 --> 02:00:49.822]  It's going to be announced the next few weeks, and we've asked, and now they say no word yet.
[02:00:50.682 --> 02:00:52.164]  Because we caught them, folks.
[02:00:52.484 --> 02:00:53.965]  There's not just evil in the universe.
[02:00:54.546 --> 02:00:55.426]  And I said that at the time.
[02:00:55.466 --> 02:00:58.689]  I said, I'm not saying they're going to do the new COVID controls.
[02:00:59.130 --> 02:01:05.115]  I'm saying they're going to try a rollout again, and we aren't just jellyfish, spineless creatures.
[02:01:05.695 --> 02:01:14.740]  We can stand up and say, no, this is super unpopular, they've been exposed, their agenda's in trouble, and all we've got to do is say no, no, no.
[02:01:15.561 --> 02:01:18.702]  And it will definitely be a lot better than if we say yes, yes, yes.
[02:01:18.962 --> 02:01:22.364]  And I said, I want to be here in a few months when we've backed off a bunch of it.
[02:01:22.384 --> 02:01:23.445]  I think they'll get some of it done.
[02:01:23.485 --> 02:01:23.985]  I said that.
[02:01:24.726 --> 02:01:27.948]  And I'll be attacked and said, look, he said all this, it didn't happen.
[02:01:28.148 --> 02:01:29.528]  Yeah, because we stopped your ass.
[02:01:29.709 --> 02:01:30.129]  That's why.
[02:01:32.295 --> 02:01:36.258]  It's like if a fire's coming towards a neighborhood, and the fire department gets out there and stops it!
[02:01:37.578 --> 02:01:40.861]  Fire department calls you and says, get out of your house, it may burn your house down.
[02:01:40.921 --> 02:01:41.281]  Evacuate.
[02:01:41.341 --> 02:01:48.366]  And then you're like, a week later, when the firefighters have put the fire out and the firefighter died, you bitch at him and you say, hey, you said it was gonna burn the neighborhood down!
[02:01:48.586 --> 02:01:50.607]  It only got to 50 feet from our house!
[02:01:51.308 --> 02:01:51.968]  Ya liar!
[02:01:52.328 --> 02:01:54.490]  The fire... Yeah!
[02:01:55.010 --> 02:01:57.151]  You stopped it, we stopped it, so far.
[02:01:57.171 --> 02:01:59.233]  Alright, here's Bloomberg yesterday.
[02:02:00.799 --> 02:02:02.840]  COVID is back, here's what you need to know.
[02:02:04.541 --> 02:02:08.723]  And it's... Well, I had to read the article about one of your calls.
[02:02:08.763 --> 02:02:14.545]  It's like, the emergency may seem like a distant past, but it's back and we need all the controls again.
[02:02:15.306 --> 02:02:16.186]  So, yeah.
[02:02:16.926 --> 02:02:20.208]  You saw him try to roll it all out, and almost no one's buying it.
[02:02:21.175 --> 02:02:22.376]  Because there's a debate about it.
[02:02:22.756 --> 02:02:24.057]  They wanted to do it by stealth.
[02:02:24.437 --> 02:02:25.338]  We didn't do that.
[02:02:25.418 --> 02:02:27.300]  That's why they want you silenced.
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:29.461]  That's why they want me silenced.
[02:02:30.102 --> 02:02:36.667]  That's why Biden's all threatened in the video I played last hour, where, don't listen to people that don't say take the shots.
[02:02:36.707 --> 02:02:37.487]  The shots are great.
[02:02:40.389 --> 02:02:40.970]  They're desperate.
[02:02:42.451 --> 02:02:44.573]  Things they control, like the border, they can dissolve.
[02:02:45.313 --> 02:02:47.595]  Things like the dollar they control, they can devalue.
[02:02:49.326 --> 02:02:52.728]  But they don't control you and your body until you submit to them.
[02:02:53.269 --> 02:02:53.949]  And they're pissed.
[02:02:55.370 --> 02:02:56.211]  They've made their move.
[02:02:56.231 --> 02:02:57.251]  We're in a war, people.
[02:02:58.072 --> 02:02:59.493]  Alright, David in Florida.
[02:03:00.513 --> 02:03:01.634]  Let's talk about the Bible.
[02:03:02.515 --> 02:03:03.936]  I always love to talk about the Bible.
[02:03:04.676 --> 02:03:05.877]  David, you're on the air from Florida.
[02:03:06.677 --> 02:03:08.599]  Right on, the great Alex Jones.
[02:03:08.659 --> 02:03:10.380]  Hey, listen, we are in a war, brother.
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:14.863]  And if the alpha males like us, they're gonna put the information out there.
[02:03:15.379 --> 02:03:15.900]  Guess what?
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:19.723]  I used to work military intelligence when I was younger in the military, okay?
[02:03:20.403 --> 02:03:20.704]  U.S.
[02:03:20.784 --> 02:03:21.064]  Army.
[02:03:21.404 --> 02:03:22.485]  Have a top-secret clearance.
[02:03:22.505 --> 02:03:23.266]  Let me tell you something.
[02:03:23.286 --> 02:03:24.427]  Information is vital.
[02:03:25.649 --> 02:03:27.831]  And our strength comes from the word of God.
[02:03:28.472 --> 02:03:30.714]  Our strength is the sword of God.
[02:03:30.734 --> 02:03:38.541]  That's the descriptive thing we find out in the sixth chapter of Ephesians as Saint Paul takes you through the armament.
[02:03:38.741 --> 02:03:42.444]  At last he names the sword and he names it as the word of God.
[02:03:42.464 --> 02:03:50.001]   A sword to a warrior means a A tool to put your enemy down.
[02:03:50.262 --> 02:03:51.703]  Now we're told it.
[02:03:51.963 --> 02:03:53.204]  That sword is the word.
[02:03:53.284 --> 02:03:54.565]  So let's go to the word.
[02:03:54.925 --> 02:03:56.687]  There's a lie being told.
[02:03:57.527 --> 02:03:57.908]  Okay?
[02:03:58.248 --> 02:04:00.250]  At the center of it is a vortex.
[02:04:00.930 --> 02:04:01.350]  Alright?
[02:04:01.431 --> 02:04:03.933]  That Satan owns in all of his little minions.
[02:04:04.793 --> 02:04:13.000]  That lie is also a cornerstone and is also the first covenant God made with Noah when he got off the ark.
[02:04:14.249 --> 02:04:18.792]  That lie proves climate change is just that.
[02:04:19.313 --> 02:04:22.135]  A lie that everything else stems from.
[02:04:22.931 --> 02:04:23.451]  All of it.
[02:04:23.811 --> 02:04:26.012]  The COVID program, you name it, brother.
[02:04:26.532 --> 02:04:27.032]  It's there.
[02:04:27.052 --> 02:04:29.873]  So let's have a little look at what we've got to read here.
[02:04:30.273 --> 02:04:31.613]  So he brings him off the ark.
[02:04:31.673 --> 02:04:33.774]  He tells him, be fruitful and multiply.
[02:04:34.214 --> 02:04:39.495]  He's talking about not only Noah, his wife and his three sons' wives, but also all the animals he brought with him.
[02:04:40.076 --> 02:04:41.156]  OK, well, guess what?
[02:04:41.276 --> 02:04:43.657]  Now we're not supposed to multiply.
[02:04:43.757 --> 02:04:45.237]  Somebody else has got their hand in it.
[02:04:45.257 --> 02:04:45.697]  No, you're right.
[02:04:45.797 --> 02:04:47.898]  Everything the globalists do is a twisted counterfeit.
[02:04:48.258 --> 02:04:50.018]  God controls the climate, not them.
[02:04:50.318 --> 02:04:51.879]  So Bill Gates wants to black out the sun.
[02:04:51.939 --> 02:04:52.319]  Exactly.
[02:04:53.288 --> 02:04:54.089]  Here's the proof.
[02:04:54.609 --> 02:04:56.290]  So what did Noah do?
[02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:57.070]  He built an ark.
[02:04:57.311 --> 02:04:57.771]  Excuse me.
[02:04:57.971 --> 02:04:58.671]  Yeah, he built the ark.
[02:04:58.711 --> 02:04:59.932]  He got off it and built an altar.
[02:05:00.532 --> 02:05:02.914]  And then he started doing sacrifices of all the clean beast.
[02:05:03.314 --> 02:05:04.335]  So we're going to start 21.
[02:05:04.375 --> 02:05:07.197]  We're going to end in 22 of the 8th chapter of Genesis.
[02:05:07.537 --> 02:05:18.984]  And the Lord smelled a sweet favor, and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth.
[02:05:19.813 --> 02:05:24.174]  Neither will I smite anymore everything living as I have done.
[02:05:25.194 --> 02:05:38.418]  While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold, and heat, and summer, and winter, and day, and night, shall not cease.
[02:05:42.133 --> 02:05:43.394]  That's the sword, warriors!
[02:05:43.835 --> 02:05:44.536]  Take it forth!
[02:05:44.956 --> 02:05:53.005]  You parents, you got these kids out here, they're going to these public schools, you can't keep them out of it just because the Santa said he's gonna bulb a whistle on CRT and everyone's gonna get in line?
[02:05:53.306 --> 02:05:54.187]  He's a liar, too.
[02:05:54.367 --> 02:05:54.888]  Guess what?
[02:05:55.648 --> 02:05:56.850]  You read that to those kids.
[02:05:57.378 --> 02:05:57.718]  All right.
[02:05:57.958 --> 02:06:00.860]  You baby Christians, get in that book.
[02:06:01.381 --> 02:06:02.401]  Y'all gotta get in the book.
[02:06:02.461 --> 02:06:04.142]  Might I suggest a King James Version?
[02:06:04.223 --> 02:06:06.604]  Do not believe what you read on the internet.
[02:06:06.964 --> 02:06:08.465]  They're calling it a King James Version.
[02:06:08.806 --> 02:06:09.526]  It's a lie.
[02:06:09.866 --> 02:06:13.148]  Harari himself said he's gonna rewrite the entire thing, okay?
[02:06:14.089 --> 02:06:14.709]  Get the book.
[02:06:15.010 --> 02:06:15.790]  You'll need another book.
[02:06:15.810 --> 02:06:18.192]  It's called A Strong's Exhaustive Concordance.
[02:06:18.212 --> 02:06:21.654]  It has every word in the Bible and every place it appears.
[02:06:22.296 --> 02:06:25.639]  That'll be a big help to all the information warriors.
[02:06:25.759 --> 02:06:26.860]  This is our source.
[02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:27.261]  No, you're right.
[02:06:27.281 --> 02:06:29.142]  The Bible is a weapon system.
[02:06:30.083 --> 02:06:31.685]  It is a weapon system.
[02:06:32.325 --> 02:06:32.806]  Thank you.
[02:06:33.186 --> 02:06:34.467]  It has a core in it.
[02:06:35.008 --> 02:06:41.173]  When God set in a ray his shielding in the very beginning, and I'll tell you, I'll tell you only a bit longer.
[02:06:41.534 --> 02:06:42.495]  Let me tell you something.
[02:06:42.615 --> 02:06:44.937]  Everything is built around a circle, you understand?
[02:06:45.683 --> 02:06:48.826]  Okay, God put himself in that circle.
[02:06:49.206 --> 02:06:52.929]  He put Moses next to him and then Aaron.
[02:06:53.499 --> 02:06:58.122]  He surrounded himself with all tribes of the 12 tribes of Israel.
[02:06:58.202 --> 02:07:01.784]  It's a 360 degree defense system.
[02:07:02.305 --> 02:07:07.949]  Just like the 360 degree offense system you heard me speak of earlier.
[02:07:08.309 --> 02:07:10.410]  Those are the low vibration operations.
[02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:11.911]  Those are your Ferrari's.
[02:07:12.311 --> 02:07:14.253]  Those are your Biden's.
[02:07:14.673 --> 02:07:15.233]  The Clinton's.
[02:07:15.353 --> 02:07:16.474]  The list goes on and on.
[02:07:16.534 --> 02:07:17.595]  We don't need to reiterate.
[02:07:18.175 --> 02:07:18.495]  Okay?
[02:07:18.715 --> 02:07:21.737]  The others are you and me, the warriors, the alpha male.
[02:07:22.017 --> 02:07:22.337]  Okay?
[02:07:22.817 --> 02:07:24.638]  And let's not let out the women either.
[02:07:24.778 --> 02:07:27.359]  There's plenty of women that read the word.
[02:07:27.719 --> 02:07:28.860]  Guess what Eve means?
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:29.840]  Giver of life.
[02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:32.601]  There are no alpha males without the women.
[02:07:33.202 --> 02:07:34.082]  Let's get that straight.
[02:07:34.362 --> 02:07:34.582]  Right?
[02:07:34.902 --> 02:07:35.123]  Right?
[02:07:35.203 --> 02:07:35.523]  Okay?
[02:07:35.823 --> 02:07:37.003]  We're all in this game.
[02:07:37.484 --> 02:07:37.724]  Okay?
[02:07:37.964 --> 02:07:39.204]  They're taking our children.
[02:07:39.985 --> 02:07:41.885]  They're lying to us about what they're being taught.
[02:07:41.946 --> 02:07:43.286]  You've got to teach it at home.
[02:07:43.306 --> 02:07:45.147]  Or they'll never learn it.
[02:07:47.978 --> 02:07:48.720]  Amen to that, brother.
[02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:49.782]  I really appreciate your call.
[02:07:49.883 --> 02:07:50.424]  Powerful.
[02:07:50.464 --> 02:07:50.865]  Thank you.
[02:07:51.627 --> 02:07:52.609]  Jake in Florida.
[02:07:52.649 --> 02:07:53.230]  You're on the air.
[02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:53.711]  Go ahead.
[02:07:55.395 --> 02:07:55.636]  Hey, Alex.
[02:07:55.656 --> 02:07:56.137]  Can you hear me?
[02:07:56.317 --> 02:07:56.538]  Yes, sir.
[02:07:57.734 --> 02:08:12.529]  Yeah, I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on the sustainability of the whole country, which we only have like 50-60,000 virus being bused to New York, and it's, you know, looking like it's ready to collapse, yet we have estimated 3 plus million a year coming to the U.S.
[02:08:12.989 --> 02:08:15.552]  By Biden's fourth year, it'll be 10 million, who knows how many.
[02:08:15.652 --> 02:08:17.514]  It's way more than 3 million.
[02:08:17.554 --> 02:08:24.485]   How much more, that's conservative, how much more can this country take Before it just, you know... Oh, you're right.
[02:08:24.565 --> 02:08:27.269]  We are being collapsed and bankrupted right now.
[02:08:27.289 --> 02:08:29.872]  I mean, that's BlackRock's plan, so we're in it.
[02:08:30.994 --> 02:08:39.766]  Yeah, I mean, maybe this is all part of the great reason I like to talk about, but... No, they said they would create replacement migration that's designed to collapse the infrastructure.
[02:08:40.748 --> 02:08:44.950]  Yeah, and then you see places like Philadelphia overnight, you know, get looted, raided.
[02:08:44.970 --> 02:08:49.632]  How much would it take for a few million, you know, illegals to have a little unrest?
[02:08:49.812 --> 02:08:50.812]  And pretty much you're on your own.
[02:08:50.832 --> 02:08:55.054]  And they've all got government UN cell phones, just like cell phones.
[02:08:55.214 --> 02:08:59.996]  And exactly, they can direct those groups, like they do the Muslims in Europe, to burn it all down.
[02:09:00.976 --> 02:09:02.717]  Yeah, that was my one question.
[02:09:02.777 --> 02:09:06.820]  I just was wondering what you thought, you know, like the moment, how much longer do you think we could take of this?
[02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:10.342]  Because I don't even think we can make it to the next election the way it is.
[02:09:10.843 --> 02:09:12.604]  I mean, this is the new military attack.
[02:09:12.624 --> 02:09:13.885]  America is under attack.
[02:09:14.565 --> 02:09:18.248]  We're a strong, resilient country, but they're trying to put the front runner in prison.
[02:09:19.108 --> 02:09:22.050]  They're persecuting all the independent media at levels never before seen.
[02:09:22.550 --> 02:09:24.792]  They're passing all these laws in Europe to ban free speech.
[02:09:24.872 --> 02:09:25.492]  It's coming here.
[02:09:25.512 --> 02:09:27.334]  I mean, we're in the fight, brother.
[02:09:27.374 --> 02:09:27.794]  This is it.
[02:09:28.194 --> 02:09:28.634]  I know this.
[02:09:28.715 --> 02:09:31.395]   If we don't stand up and speak out, it'll be ten times worse.
[02:09:31.395 --> 02:09:36.554]   Again, the propaganda wouldn't be necessary if the situation was hopeless, but we are
[02:09:36.554 --> 02:09:37.954]  approaching an event horizon.
[02:09:38.518 --> 02:09:39.218]  Thank you so much.
[02:09:39.258 --> 02:09:39.938]  Anything else, Jake?
[02:09:40.059 --> 02:09:40.499]  You're gone?
[02:09:40.619 --> 02:09:40.919]  All right.
[02:09:41.199 --> 02:09:43.060]  We'll be right back with Justin and many others.
[02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:43.781]  Please stay with us.
[02:09:44.681 --> 02:09:45.902]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:09:45.922 --> 02:09:47.283]  That's how you overpower the AI.
[02:09:48.004 --> 02:09:50.405]  Look, they've made their move, but it's causing a great awakening.
[02:09:50.845 --> 02:09:51.666]  We're going to see what happens.
[02:09:51.686 --> 02:09:52.807]  It's going to be very interesting.
[02:09:53.567 --> 02:09:54.728]  Knock them dead, kid!
[02:09:55.148 --> 02:09:55.609]  Knock them!
[02:09:57.250 --> 02:09:58.450]  Knock them dead, kid!
[02:09:59.271 --> 02:10:00.652]  In the heat of the night!
[02:10:01.627 --> 02:10:02.428]  Woo!
[02:10:03.369 --> 02:10:06.612]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:10:07.733 --> 02:10:08.434]  Knock them dead.
[02:10:08.454 --> 02:10:12.417]  All right, let's go right back to your phone calls here on this live Thursday broadcast.
[02:10:13.138 --> 02:10:14.279]  Let's go to Justin in Florida.
[02:10:14.299 --> 02:10:15.160]  A lot of calls from Florida.
[02:10:15.180 --> 02:10:16.361]  I'm just going in the order they received.
[02:10:16.861 --> 02:10:18.363]  Justin, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:10:18.403 --> 02:10:18.803]  Go ahead.
[02:10:18.823 --> 02:10:20.785]  Hey, Alex.
[02:10:20.885 --> 02:10:22.267]  Long time listener.
[02:10:22.747 --> 02:10:24.389]  Listen, I just want to plug your products.
[02:10:24.969 --> 02:10:26.811]  I've been doing this for 15 years.
[02:10:27.859 --> 02:10:30.540]  And I've been on the fence for about 13 of those years.
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:45.043]  I finally ordered your products last year and the Nitric Boost, your Nitric Oxide, your Brain Force Plus and Ultra, and your Turbo Force Plus has completely changed my life for the better.
[02:10:45.423 --> 02:10:48.704]  I'm able to get through my 12 to 13 hour days working on a farm.
[02:10:49.344 --> 02:10:56.686]  I go home, I drop a little bit of the Brain Force Ultra underneath my tongue and I'm good for three hours being a good husband, being a good father.
[02:10:57.341 --> 02:11:02.184]  And I just want to say you really empowered my life, and I thank you for you and your product.
[02:11:02.444 --> 02:11:06.146]  Well, I'm not the greatest example because I put myself through hell for 29 years.
[02:11:06.607 --> 02:11:11.070]  And people say, oh, this guy's a subliminal seller, and he looks like Lex Luthor.
[02:11:11.090 --> 02:11:13.251]  But these are all just the best things that are out there.
[02:11:13.551 --> 02:11:15.452]  Whatever the best stuff is, we go get it, we sell it.
[02:11:15.472 --> 02:11:16.373]  So I appreciate your support.
[02:11:17.834 --> 02:11:18.474]  Yeah, no problem.
[02:11:18.494 --> 02:11:23.057]  So I just got your book, and it was speaking about the Trilateral Commission.
[02:11:23.820 --> 02:11:25.161]  So I just got a question for you.
[02:11:25.221 --> 02:11:29.042]  How deeply embedded are they in today's politics?
[02:11:30.823 --> 02:11:32.544]  Well, this is a big subject.
[02:11:34.204 --> 02:11:50.291]  And so to talk about the Trilateral Commission, you've got to talk about the British Institute of International Affairs, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, that set up the Council on Foreign Relations in 1922 at Pratt House in New York with the express aim of merging the British Empire with the new American Empire.
[02:11:51.069 --> 02:12:05.724]  And then out of that they created other roundtable groups that are corporate governmental interfaces where you see the Capitol, you see the Parliament, you think decisions are being made there, they're being made inside these intelligence agency corporate operations.
[02:12:06.404 --> 02:12:37.532]   And so in the mid-70s with Zbigniew Brzezinski and then when he became president, Jimmy Carter, David Rockefeller created the Trilateral Commission globally to organize the different CFR roundtable groups into a better command and control system, and it mainly coordinates the monetary issues, whereas the CFR tries to coordinate all the major issues, military, domestic, international, banking, you know,
[02:12:39.477 --> 02:12:39.817]  All of it.
[02:12:40.538 --> 02:12:43.999]  And so the Trilateral Commission's aim is to establish world government.
[02:12:44.019 --> 02:12:45.980]  But that was just one mechanism.
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:49.742]  It was the Rockefellers gave the land to the UN in the late 40s.
[02:12:49.842 --> 02:12:55.845]  It was the Rockefellers set up the first UN in 46 at Presidio in San Francisco.
[02:12:56.605 --> 02:12:58.146]  And so they write books about it.
[02:12:58.186 --> 02:13:03.509]  I mean, David Rockefeller wrote a book, Reflections, about 15 years ago, where he admits it all.
[02:13:03.529 --> 02:13:04.909]  About 300 pages long.
[02:13:04.949 --> 02:13:05.890]  I suggest you all read it.
[02:13:07.070 --> 02:13:09.692]  German Chancellors have written books, British Prime Ministers have written books.
[02:13:10.152 --> 02:13:11.453]  They see us as dumb animals.
[02:13:11.513 --> 02:13:21.878]  So, they admit in these books, we're setting up world government, we're going to end the family as you know it, we're going to turn humans into automatons, those that survive, we're going to depopulate people 80%.
[02:13:23.139 --> 02:13:29.463]  And now it's not just in books, they have world government summits, like they had six months ago, where they say, we're setting up world government.
[02:13:30.101 --> 02:13:35.900]   And then Elon Musk comes on and says, "I don't support you, and I think you're setting up a tyranny."
[02:13:35.900 --> 02:13:40.101]   Now, whether he's good or bad, him saying that shows how weak they are,
[02:13:40.101 --> 02:13:42.902]  and that he at least wants to look like the opposition.
[02:13:42.902 --> 02:13:49.402]   So you can just, regardless of whether he's good or bad, him doing that shows major fissures
[02:13:49.402 --> 02:13:53.800]   in the power structure not agreeing with the direction it's going. Does that make sense?
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:59.300]   Oh yeah, for sure. And I just want to say, God bless you, keep up the good work, and thank you for taking my call.
[02:13:59.342 --> 02:13:59.963]  Thank you, brother.
[02:14:00.023 --> 02:14:02.165]  Really good question about the Trilateral Commission.
[02:14:02.765 --> 02:14:04.147]  Let's go to George in Texas.
[02:14:04.167 --> 02:14:04.987]  You're on the air, George.
[02:14:05.868 --> 02:14:07.570]  Hey, nice talking to you, Mr. Jones.
[02:14:08.277 --> 02:14:08.577]  Pleasure.
[02:14:09.517 --> 02:14:10.638]  Okay, thank you.
[02:14:10.718 --> 02:14:14.679]  I just want to let you know, I also know some of the same people you do, Pastor Rodney Howard-Brown.
[02:14:14.859 --> 02:14:16.659]  I'm good friends with him, Pastor Eric Grunion.
[02:14:17.139 --> 02:14:18.159]  I have their cell phone numbers.
[02:14:18.359 --> 02:14:21.000]  They're absolutely the best.
[02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:21.820]  I mean, the real deal.
[02:14:22.781 --> 02:14:28.102]  And I have a small family ranch here in Texas also, and like, back to the Civil War days, my family dates back.
[02:14:29.614 --> 02:14:33.777]  Unfortunately, I have a son that works in the top security clearance in the government.
[02:14:34.537 --> 02:14:38.140]  Just left Quantico, Virginia about a month ago, heading down south a little ways.
[02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:40.601]  Anyways, I probably know more than I should.
[02:14:41.062 --> 02:14:42.283]  I also have a YouTube video.
[02:14:42.303 --> 02:14:43.223]  Could I plug it real quick?
[02:14:43.263 --> 02:14:43.583]  Yes, sir.
[02:14:44.204 --> 02:14:46.405]  Constitutionalshirtsofamerica.com.
[02:14:46.465 --> 02:14:50.148]  And I've got about 50 sands of shirts I didn't put them all there because the Lord gave me.
[02:14:50.788 --> 02:14:53.730]  And basically what I wanted to tell you... Well, say it again.
[02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:55.692]  What's the name of the website and the name of the YouTube?
[02:14:56.092 --> 02:14:58.914]  It's Constitutionalshirtsofamerica.com.
[02:14:59.034 --> 02:14:59.274]  Love it.
[02:14:59.955 --> 02:15:03.598]  I haven't made a stupid video about Snoop Dogg the other day making fun of the president.
[02:15:04.259 --> 02:15:08.243]  So anyway, it's pretty dumb because I'm just a hillbilly country guy with a muscle and nerve disease.
[02:15:08.843 --> 02:15:10.125]  But here's my question to you, sir.
[02:15:10.825 --> 02:15:13.328]  Man, I know you know this because you're a very smart guy and you're blessed by God.
[02:15:13.788 --> 02:15:16.851]  We're going to have to start getting together and we're going to have to start getting with our sheriffs.
[02:15:16.992 --> 02:15:18.333]  And look, you've got a big platform.
[02:15:18.373 --> 02:15:19.034]  You could do this.
[02:15:19.914 --> 02:15:22.357]  Because, like I told the guy, make sure your phone's clear.
[02:15:23.331 --> 02:15:25.716]  Who's going to come help us when things hit?
[02:15:25.876 --> 02:15:28.862]  And I will tell you this, if they wanted to, you're aware of this.
[02:15:29.322 --> 02:15:30.424]  They could shut you down tomorrow.
[02:15:31.025 --> 02:15:33.350]  I'm telling you, I know more than I should.
[02:15:35.626 --> 02:15:39.167]  They just ain't ready to roll everything out, but we're in some serious trouble.
[02:15:39.667 --> 02:15:43.188]  We either got to get with our sheriffs, but we got to get with one accord like in the Book of Acts.
[02:15:43.248 --> 02:15:44.688]  Jesus said, go tarry in Jerusalem.
[02:15:45.208 --> 02:15:50.330]  And it said when they got into one accord, then the Holy Ghost showed up and hit them and do them with fire and power.
[02:15:50.830 --> 02:15:52.291]  This is beyond man's control.
[02:15:52.991 --> 02:15:57.592]  Information can go out all day long, but until you take that information, do something with it.
[02:15:57.692 --> 02:16:02.140]   I just wish, Mr. Jones, that maybe the sheriff You've got to know your local sheriff.
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:04.682]  You've got to know where he stands because he's going to be your main helper.
[02:16:04.702 --> 02:16:07.624]  He's going to be one of them.
[02:16:07.664 --> 02:16:10.906]  I 100% agree and I've had Sheriff Mack on 50 times.
[02:16:11.326 --> 02:16:16.470]  Getting back on, I've had a lot of folks that aren't with us anymore like Sheriff Richard Mack on countless times.
[02:16:16.930 --> 02:16:20.333]  And the sheriff is a constitutional officer and we need to get behind the sheriff.
[02:16:20.353 --> 02:16:22.574]  We need to get good sheriffs in or remove bad sheriffs.
[02:16:23.475 --> 02:16:38.531]   And the reason They can't shut us all off right now, and though they're getting their FEMA drills and their FEMA national test, Jack's calling it about that in a moment for South Carolina, they've got to get the people in the system to go along with it before the AI takes over.
[02:16:39.091 --> 02:16:46.556]  Once the AI is in control, they've got a big enough robot army and drone army that can cut the resources off, they're going to fully remove humans out of the equation.
[02:16:47.076 --> 02:16:52.460]  And that's really their holy grail, it's their brass ring, it's their endgame, it's their final destination, it's their goal.
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:55.201]  Uh, so yeah, I know they can pull the plug.
[02:16:55.241 --> 02:16:56.541]  I got internet kill switches in.
[02:16:57.641 --> 02:16:59.422]  It's all there, but it would be too obvious.
[02:16:59.862 --> 02:17:05.063]  They've got to have a story why they take Trump's hotels and condos and golf courses away.
[02:17:05.543 --> 02:17:08.364]  Oh, he's a fraud, a judge said, not a jury.
[02:17:08.804 --> 02:17:11.365]  The judge tells the jury he's guilty as a show trial.
[02:17:12.045 --> 02:17:13.866]  Oh, Alex Jones, you know, it was just business.
[02:17:13.906 --> 02:17:14.566]  He got shut down.
[02:17:14.866 --> 02:17:16.506]  They've got to make it look plausible.
[02:17:17.407 --> 02:17:20.127]  Uh, but, um, yeah, we're, we're definitely in dangerous waters.
[02:17:21.268 --> 02:17:22.428]  The little guys, what I'm wondering.
[02:17:23.078 --> 02:17:24.778]  Us little guys are going to need you big guys.
[02:17:25.098 --> 02:17:25.839]  I mean, I support you.
[02:17:25.879 --> 02:17:30.920]  Brother, this big guy, this big guy is just battling to stay... I hear you.
[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:32.480]  I'm not as big as you think.
[02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:37.261]  I mean, I may have a little bit of a belly, but I'm not, you know, the point is I'm not big.
[02:17:37.281 --> 02:17:45.323]  I mean, God's big and I've been given, you know, power and understanding somewhat by God, though I'm a broken vessel, obviously, and imperfect.
[02:17:45.723 --> 02:17:49.143]  I see through a rose colored darkly, but I do see very clear compared to most.
[02:17:49.724 --> 02:17:51.044]  And I can just tell you, you're right.
[02:17:51.664 --> 02:17:54.546]  You just need to raise the alarm to everybody in the community, and you guys need to get together.
[02:17:54.586 --> 02:17:55.327]  I appreciate your call.
[02:17:56.647 --> 02:17:58.068]  People say, how are you big guys going to help us?
[02:17:58.849 --> 02:18:01.731]  I can barely keep the show on the air to get the information out.
[02:18:02.251 --> 02:18:04.293]  It's up to you, with God working through you.
[02:18:05.033 --> 02:18:08.095]  Let's go to Mary in Tennessee, and then we'll go to Jack in South Carolina.
[02:18:08.656 --> 02:18:09.376]  You're on the air, Mary.
[02:18:09.676 --> 02:18:11.117]  Oh, wait, we gotta go to break, sorry.
[02:18:12.078 --> 02:18:13.539]  I apologize, I can't skip all these breaks.
[02:18:14.179 --> 02:18:18.943]  Mary, I'm coming right back to you, and then Jack in South Carolina, and Colin, everybody else, we'll get to all your calls.
[02:18:20.623 --> 02:18:22.024]  Well, the next guest host takes over.
[02:18:22.884 --> 02:18:25.406]  InfoWars.com is tomorrow's news today.
[02:18:25.426 --> 02:18:27.307]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:18:27.347 --> 02:18:28.587]  Without you, we would not be here.
[02:18:28.627 --> 02:18:30.428]  So yeah, I need the listeners.
[02:18:30.488 --> 02:18:31.889]  You guys together are the big guy.
[02:18:32.430 --> 02:18:36.572]  God's a big, big, big, big guy, but you guys collectively are the big guy, not me.
[02:18:37.072 --> 02:18:37.752]  Please get that straight.
[02:18:37.792 --> 02:18:38.253]  I'm the tail.
[02:18:38.293 --> 02:18:38.793]  You're the dog.
[02:18:39.473 --> 02:18:41.595]  Mary in Tennessee, thanks for calling.
[02:18:41.615 --> 02:18:42.055]  You're on the air.
[02:18:44.247 --> 02:18:44.828]  Hey Alex.
[02:18:45.008 --> 02:18:48.631]  Hey, I wish I had a lifetime survivor dad's turmeric toothpaste.
[02:18:48.711 --> 02:18:49.552]  It's amazing.
[02:18:49.692 --> 02:18:50.693]  It's changed my life.
[02:18:50.874 --> 02:18:51.254]  Thank you.
[02:18:51.794 --> 02:18:56.359]  And yes, and Alex, I'm one of the alpha females.
[02:18:56.419 --> 02:19:07.430]  I've called not just my own sheriff, but I've called other sheriffs, all of the sheriffs of Maine, all of the sheriffs of Maryland, some of the sheriffs of Alabama and California, and I've got a list of others.
[02:19:08.112 --> 02:19:18.335]  I urge them to go and confiscate the bioweapons wherever they can find them because we know now that they don't stop the illnesses that they're named after.
[02:19:18.355 --> 02:19:22.797]  They create illnesses and no one can sue over any of this.
[02:19:22.997 --> 02:19:28.739]  And so they are bioweapons and none of the sheriffs that I talked to said no.
[02:19:29.119 --> 02:19:30.299]  They all said okay.
[02:19:30.700 --> 02:19:31.780]  Every single one of them.
[02:19:32.657 --> 02:19:52.027]   And so I would urge everyone to call your local sheriff, urge them to go and confiscate the bioweapons as soon as possible, because we know that they're not only planning the COVID-19 for babies, they're also Urging parents to get these babies 8 months old and younger an RSV shot.
[02:19:52.067 --> 02:19:52.968]  That's a new thing.
[02:19:53.088 --> 02:19:58.314]  And also... Well sure, I mean on the surface it sounds far-fetched to have sheriffs go kick bioweapons labs.
[02:19:58.354 --> 02:19:58.534]  No.
[02:19:58.874 --> 02:19:59.875]  We know there's gain of function.
[02:19:59.895 --> 02:20:00.996]  We know they're doing illegal stuff.
[02:20:01.336 --> 02:20:05.280]  They already kicked Obama's lab out of North Carolina 8 years ago.
[02:20:05.681 --> 02:20:09.865]  We should have the state legislatures and local governments say, get your bioweapon lab out.
[02:20:10.225 --> 02:20:13.186]  Like, you know, people don't want a homeless shelter or a prison in their neighborhood.
[02:20:13.486 --> 02:20:15.947]  Those are nothing compared to a bio-weapons lab.
[02:20:15.967 --> 02:20:17.548]  What you're saying is absolutely true.
[02:20:19.528 --> 02:20:20.389]  Yes, exactly.
[02:20:20.529 --> 02:20:27.251]  And that's why none of the sheriffs acted like I was crazy or said, you know, no, that sounds ridiculous.
[02:20:27.291 --> 02:20:28.331]  They all said okay.
[02:20:28.832 --> 02:20:33.313]  Yeah, I mean, that's Time Magazine, the dangers of invisible bio-labs across the U.S.
[02:20:33.353 --> 02:20:34.754]  I mean, you're right.
[02:20:34.934 --> 02:20:37.395]  And it's like, oh, bio-labs, that sounds crazy.
[02:20:37.455 --> 02:20:38.255]  No, they're all over the place.
[02:20:39.544 --> 02:20:41.066]  Yeah, it's your local drugstore.
[02:20:41.086 --> 02:20:42.327]  They're the biolabs now.
[02:20:42.367 --> 02:20:43.328]  It's your health department.
[02:20:43.388 --> 02:20:43.928]  No, you're right.
[02:20:43.948 --> 02:20:46.230]  Well, the drugstore is the bioweapon delivery system.
[02:20:47.091 --> 02:20:50.154]  The bioweapon factory are these facilities.
[02:20:51.114 --> 02:20:51.935]  Right, exactly.
[02:20:51.995 --> 02:20:58.021]  And we saw the one get blown away in a tornado just a couple months ago, the Pfizer facility.
[02:20:58.141 --> 02:20:59.202]  I saw that.
[02:20:59.882 --> 02:21:17.771]   And we also want to talk about, someone referred earlier to the Bible, and it's very interesting What these, uh, everyone's God, uh, hasn't told them about what's happening, what's gonna happen whenever, uh, you know, you're involved in, uh,
[02:21:18.664 --> 02:21:21.706]  Total corruption in high places, like the government.
[02:21:21.807 --> 02:21:25.650]  Who could even vote for the government at this point when we know it's all rigged?
[02:21:26.050 --> 02:21:29.733]  Anybody in a... That's right, we have a tyranny at war with us.
[02:21:29.793 --> 02:21:30.573]  I gotta jump, Mary.
[02:21:30.593 --> 02:21:31.134]  Great points.
[02:21:31.894 --> 02:21:34.697]  Let's go to Jack in South Carolina.
[02:21:35.337 --> 02:21:39.180]  Let's talk about the big FEMA emergency drill coming up in just six days.
[02:21:40.701 --> 02:21:41.982]  Yeah, what's going on the great?
[02:21:42.002 --> 02:21:44.044]  Good to talk to you, brother.
[02:21:44.064 --> 02:21:45.505]  What's happening?
[02:21:45.545 --> 02:21:46.626]  How you doing, Alex Jones?
[02:21:47.100 --> 02:21:50.505]  Who ever thought that Alex Jones would like to hump back way over?
[02:21:51.266 --> 02:21:51.626]  Humping.
[02:21:52.107 --> 02:21:52.888]  That was funny.
[02:21:52.908 --> 02:21:54.730]  You made me laugh.
[02:21:55.191 --> 02:21:55.872]  That's alright.
[02:21:56.272 --> 02:21:57.314]  You like watching them, huh?
[02:21:57.928 --> 02:21:58.688]  Yeah, question.
[02:21:58.748 --> 02:22:01.889]  We've got a big event coming up here Wednesday, October 4th.
[02:22:01.909 --> 02:22:05.731]  I don't think a lot of people are really talking about what's going on.
[02:22:05.751 --> 02:22:08.252]  It's something extraordinary.
[02:22:08.292 --> 02:22:12.433]  You're going to have a broadcast system for over 30 minutes?
[02:22:13.093 --> 02:22:14.914]  You know, that's something we've never heard of.
[02:22:14.954 --> 02:22:15.294]  That's right.
[02:22:15.314 --> 02:22:17.094]  They usually do 30 seconds or a minute.
[02:22:17.154 --> 02:22:17.755]  Yeah, 30 minutes.
[02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:25.504]  You know, I just, I can't understand that with all the phones and the computers and all that going off at one time.
[02:22:25.584 --> 02:22:26.725]  Is it something I'm missing?
[02:22:26.745 --> 02:22:29.307]  Because a lot of people ain't talking about this, you know.
[02:22:29.327 --> 02:22:31.789]  Who knows what they're loading viruses on?
[02:22:31.889 --> 02:22:33.350]  God knows what they're doing.
[02:22:33.390 --> 02:22:35.792]  They're practicing a takeover of the media is what they admit it is.
[02:22:37.216 --> 02:22:44.878]  Yeah, you know, well I talk to people down here in South Carolina and they like, I don't know this is going to happen.
[02:22:44.938 --> 02:22:46.478]  You know, they don't even know it's going to happen.
[02:22:46.518 --> 02:22:51.439]  But, you know, you always hear about the fragrance weeds they're going to, you know, put over the air and all that.
[02:22:51.799 --> 02:22:56.240]  And then the water that the solution's got the metal in it, they put in your body.
[02:22:56.640 --> 02:23:01.361]  I think it's something big that a lot of people... Well, that's like the Kingsman movie where they activate a signal and make everybody kill each other.
[02:23:02.438 --> 02:23:04.400]  Yeah, but there's a lot of people not talking about it.
[02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:10.206]  Are there any way that, you know, I want to ask you, are there any way that we can, you know, maybe help ourselves?
[02:23:10.226 --> 02:23:12.909]  You know, because am I thinking too much about this?
[02:23:12.969 --> 02:23:13.770]  Is it a big deal?
[02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:15.932]  Because I don't got earplugs.
[02:23:16.072 --> 02:23:19.256]  I mean, I'm sure it's going to be a one day attack on us.
[02:23:20.011 --> 02:23:22.012]  We need to turn these phones off when we're not using them.
[02:23:22.032 --> 02:23:26.894]  We need to turn the TV off more, go to church more, spend time with family more, exercise more, pray more.
[02:23:27.614 --> 02:23:36.278]  And yeah, I mean, they're doing the biggest emergency alert takeover test of all media in a week for a reason, because they're putting us into tyranny right now.
[02:23:36.298 --> 02:23:38.559]  So I think generally that's what you're going to expect.
[02:23:38.619 --> 02:23:40.060]  It's just a test for a takeover.
[02:23:40.860 --> 02:23:46.203]  But the CIA admits they can put out different frequencies and things, but I don't think they're going to do it en masse.
[02:23:47.623 --> 02:23:48.884]  It's more of a test of a takeover.
[02:23:49.643 --> 02:23:54.362]   and it can affect your body as different broadcasts as they're going to send over.
[02:23:54.362 --> 02:23:57.963]   And I don't know which one, you know, you got your normal broadcast signal that you're going.
[02:23:57.963 --> 02:24:01.643]   But I think it's going to be something different, but we're not spending a lot of time on this.
[02:24:01.643 --> 02:24:06.283]   And nobody's talking about it. So I'm trying to prepare, but I didn't know if you think it
[02:24:06.283 --> 02:24:10.923]   was something that's going to be big or not. But you know what? I think Wednesday coming along,
[02:24:10.923 --> 02:24:15.243]   God said no weapon formed against us was prosper if we pray about it. I think you
[02:24:15.243 --> 02:24:16.362]  need to pray about that before.
[02:24:16.517 --> 02:24:23.802]  I think it's healthy to be worried about FEMA that's in the hands of the globalists doing the biggest takeover drill of all media we've ever seen.
[02:24:23.822 --> 02:24:26.024]  I think it'll just be a test, but who knows, brother.
[02:24:26.044 --> 02:24:26.364]  Thank you.
[02:24:26.664 --> 02:24:29.046]  Because they keep hyping, oh, imminent cyber attack.
[02:24:29.086 --> 02:24:30.667]  The Russians are working with right-wingers.
[02:24:31.027 --> 02:24:32.168]  They're going to cut the power off.
[02:24:32.228 --> 02:24:33.829]  So they're pre-programming that.
[02:24:33.909 --> 02:24:35.050]  Who knows what they'll do?
[02:24:35.610 --> 02:24:36.591]  Colin in Canada.
[02:24:36.631 --> 02:24:37.252]  Thanks for calling.
[02:24:37.272 --> 02:24:37.572]  Go ahead.
[02:24:38.911 --> 02:24:39.552]  How are you, Mike?
[02:24:41.153 --> 02:24:42.394]  My man, Alex Jones.
[02:24:42.995 --> 02:24:44.136]  So glad to talk to you.
[02:24:44.156 --> 02:24:45.217]  I'm from Canada.
[02:24:45.958 --> 02:24:46.578]  Welcome, brother.
[02:24:46.598 --> 02:24:47.279]  Good to talk to you.
[02:24:48.060 --> 02:24:50.222]  It's funny how the Lord works in weird ways.
[02:24:50.422 --> 02:24:54.926]  And I gotta tell you, I've been thinking about a product you guys, maybe you and Mike and Del can put together.
[02:24:54.946 --> 02:25:04.055]  And I don't see why you guys can't do a hoodie made out of electrode material, paraday cage material.
[02:25:05.309 --> 02:25:06.771]  I think that... Oh, that's really smart.
[02:25:07.011 --> 02:25:10.214]  MIT Wire Magazine admits 5G causes massive cancer.
[02:25:10.914 --> 02:25:12.916]  And they got really lightweight Faraday cages.
[02:25:14.337 --> 02:25:17.060]  I mean, that actually protects your body from outside electromagnetics.
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:18.181]  That's actually a great idea.
[02:25:18.921 --> 02:25:21.344]  Especially with this FEMA thing that's coming up.
[02:25:21.404 --> 02:25:27.209]  I mean, I have sold one myself and ordered some stuff on Amazon, and I have noticed a huge difference.
[02:25:28.786 --> 02:25:32.309]  And it's one of those things that I think your man, Mike Lindell, might be able to help you with.
[02:25:32.349 --> 02:25:35.271]  He's got the factory to sew that kind of stuff, but I think it'll really help you guys out.
[02:25:35.291 --> 02:25:44.459]  I mean, I think just wearing lightweight Faraday in our clothing, which they can do very easily with a little bitty copper wires, is a good thing to make you think about and be aware of the radiation.
[02:25:44.479 --> 02:25:46.381]  It's like putting an extra filter on a cigarette.
[02:25:46.921 --> 02:25:49.703]  These things are causing cancer, and it sounds kooky and crazy, no?
[02:25:50.104 --> 02:25:54.928]  Shutting up all these transmitters, the microwave towers, that are admittedly causing cancer, that's crazy.
[02:25:56.058 --> 02:26:00.639]  Yes, and there's also a machine called a Riff Frequency Machine that I've been a big fan of.
[02:26:00.739 --> 02:26:02.380]  Spooky 2 is the company that puts it out.
[02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:09.182]  And when it comes to frequencies these days, I think it's the key to all the... I talked to Bloomberg Security.
[02:26:09.222 --> 02:26:09.722]  I'll leave it at that.
[02:26:09.762 --> 02:26:10.242]  High level.
[02:26:10.802 --> 02:26:15.123]  And they said Bloomberg has a Wraith machine and basically wears Faraday cages.
[02:26:15.964 --> 02:26:18.004]  So his suits have copper sewn into them.
[02:26:18.024 --> 02:26:19.105]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:26:19.145 --> 02:26:20.265]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:26:21.445 --> 02:26:23.066]  Let's go to David in Utah.
[02:26:23.086 --> 02:26:23.826]  David, you're on the air.
[02:26:23.866 --> 02:26:24.126]  Welcome.
[02:26:25.086 --> 02:26:27.087]  Hey Alex, great to hear you.
[02:26:27.107 --> 02:26:27.647]  Love your show.
[02:26:27.687 --> 02:26:28.347]  Love Owen.
[02:26:28.367 --> 02:26:30.528]  Love you too.
[02:26:30.728 --> 02:26:46.915]  Hey, my concern is, you know, Owen is obviously in the eye of the storm and he obviously will appeal, but you look at the Supreme Court justice today, they're like, we're like one heartbeat from losing.
[02:26:47.435 --> 02:26:49.376]  We've lost the executive branch.
[02:26:50.510 --> 02:26:51.431]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:26:51.470 --> 02:26:53.470]  I just feel like...
[02:26:53.470 --> 02:26:56.470]   Yeah, well they're trying to intimidate the Supreme Court with all these investigations.
[02:26:56.470 --> 02:26:59.470]   "Oh, Clarence Thomas went on a trip with a billionaire," or whatever.
[02:26:59.470 --> 02:27:02.470]  They are doing that because they don't fully control it.
[02:27:02.470 --> 02:27:03.470]  But where's the Supreme Court?
[02:27:03.470 --> 02:27:06.470]   They should already be overturning all this crap against Trump.
[02:27:06.470 --> 02:27:08.470]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:27:08.470 --> 02:27:12.470]   I'm concerned that, you know, we're three heartbeats or four heart...
[02:27:12.470 --> 02:27:15.470]   you know, whatever it is, that this whole thing turns into tyranny.
[02:27:15.470 --> 02:27:18.470]  And there'll be absolutely no way out of this situation.
[02:27:18.470 --> 02:27:22.470]   No, brother, I already think we're in a tyranny, but you're talking about a more intense tyranny.
[02:27:23.188 --> 02:27:24.650]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:27:24.670 --> 02:27:41.672]   And I think that's why, you know, defend Owen and defend Alex, and your legal fees, and I've done legal work and I know it's expensive, but you really are at the tip of the spear to You know, really, these are landmark cases.
[02:27:41.952 --> 02:27:42.972]  It's legendary.
[02:27:43.952 --> 02:27:44.852]  It is legendary.
[02:27:44.872 --> 02:27:48.493]  Notice they're now using the same default stuff on Trump and Giuliani.
[02:27:48.513 --> 02:27:49.773]  I mean, this is it.
[02:27:49.873 --> 02:27:50.673]  This is their takeover.
[02:27:50.713 --> 02:27:51.713]  Thank you so much, David.
[02:27:51.994 --> 02:27:52.574]  Thanks for calling.
[02:27:52.594 --> 02:27:53.114]  Thanks for holding.
[02:27:53.394 --> 02:27:54.094]  I'm going to move quick.
[02:27:54.274 --> 02:27:54.814]  We come back.
[02:27:54.974 --> 02:28:03.596]  Elijah, and then Tom, and then William, and then Michael, and then Drew Hernandez, always powerful, takes over.
[02:28:03.616 --> 02:28:04.376]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:04.195 --> 02:28:06.195]  I'll be back, hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:28:06.195 --> 02:28:20.195]  [Intro]
[02:28:20.195 --> 02:28:26.195]   My fellow patriots, the Trafecta has not been in stock for years.

[02:29:20.949 --> 02:29:27.674]  I'm going to hit some big electric car news at the start of the next segment that's really illustrative of how the system works, coming up.
[02:29:27.834 --> 02:29:29.355]  But right now, let's continue with your calls.
[02:29:29.696 --> 02:29:32.538]  Elijah in Ohio, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:29:34.019 --> 02:29:34.739]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:35.540]  All right, brother.
[02:29:36.857 --> 02:29:44.865]  Hey, I remember a year ago on your show, whether it's true or not, Trump brought up that he may suspend the Constitution if he gets back in.
[02:29:45.626 --> 02:29:53.093]  Again, I don't know if that was real or not, but that could be definitely a real possibility if he did get into office, so he could help fix everything.
[02:29:54.934 --> 02:29:55.875]  I don't remember hearing that.
[02:29:55.895 --> 02:29:58.138]  I mean, the Constitution's kind of suspended right now.
[02:29:59.419 --> 02:30:01.321]  We can arrest all these people under the Constitution.
[02:30:02.352 --> 02:30:02.793]  Right, yeah.
[02:30:02.813 --> 02:30:10.103]  I mean, I definitely think, you know, either the first day or two of him getting in office, when he gets back in... Well, he has to fire every U.S.
[02:30:10.183 --> 02:30:12.927]  attorney Clinton did it to take control for bad.
[02:30:12.967 --> 02:30:13.648]  He used to do it for good.
[02:30:13.688 --> 02:30:16.973]  He should fire everyone and put in people he can trust day one.
[02:30:17.932 --> 02:30:19.632]  Yeah, I 100% agree.
[02:30:19.652 --> 02:30:29.195]  And if they resist, whether he has the ability to bring in the military and arrest those people and get them out, I definitely think that that should be his top priority.
[02:30:29.255 --> 02:30:30.535]  Well, that's what they're worried about.
[02:30:30.555 --> 02:30:32.996]  And that sounds like a tyranny, but we're already under that.
[02:30:33.016 --> 02:30:35.236]  And usually that's how you end one tyranny is with that.
[02:30:35.636 --> 02:30:39.097]  The problem is once you fix a tyranny with a tyranny, it tends to stay in place.
[02:30:40.137 --> 02:30:40.337]  Right.
[02:30:40.357 --> 02:30:42.158]  Yeah, that's definitely the biggest fear.
[02:30:43.911 --> 02:30:49.733]  Honestly, out of all the other solutions that everybody's bought up, I definitely see that as being one of the top ones.
[02:30:50.274 --> 02:30:51.714]  Whether it happens or not, I don't know.
[02:30:51.734 --> 02:30:52.635]  I hope he gets in.
[02:30:53.595 --> 02:30:57.817]  But he definitely needs a clean house, because otherwise he's not going to be able to do anything like he's supposed to.
[02:30:57.837 --> 02:30:58.497]  Well, he says he is.
[02:30:58.777 --> 02:31:01.418]  So, a bunch of publications said it's preposterous.
[02:31:01.438 --> 02:31:03.919]  They claim Trump will arrest the Democrats if he's elected.
[02:31:04.199 --> 02:31:05.540]  Well, they've committed a bunch of crimes.
[02:31:06.400 --> 02:31:07.080]  So they should be.
[02:31:07.100 --> 02:31:08.161]  I mean, it's open and shut.
[02:31:08.421 --> 02:31:11.543]  They're setting up a dictatorship, a totalitarian system.
[02:31:11.563 --> 02:31:13.384]  So they've put us into this wheelhouse.
[02:31:14.064 --> 02:31:15.685]  They're the ones that brought us to this point.
[02:31:16.705 --> 02:31:18.466]  That's why it just goes from bad to worse.
[02:31:18.506 --> 02:31:19.467]  Thank you so much, Elijah.
[02:31:20.047 --> 02:31:21.148]  Let's go to Daniel in Mass.
[02:31:21.188 --> 02:31:21.708]  You're on the air.
[02:31:23.149 --> 02:31:23.889]  Alex, can you hear me?
[02:31:24.069 --> 02:31:24.369]  I can.
[02:31:24.409 --> 02:31:24.669]  Go ahead.
[02:31:24.689 --> 02:31:27.511]  So I want to talk Russia and China.
[02:31:27.931 --> 02:31:32.694]  Just to start with Russia, we have the attack heading in there, I think, as soon as possible.
[02:31:32.714 --> 02:31:33.514]  They've got 195 miles, cruise missiles.
[02:31:35.774 --> 02:31:39.437]  Yes, the Abrams are also just in Ukraine.
[02:31:40.117 --> 02:31:45.041]  The Black Sea Fleet, I think last week, that's a big attack on a major building in Crimea.
[02:31:46.002 --> 02:31:51.606]  And then the Pentagon's also going to continue to fund Ukraine during the shutdown.
[02:31:53.367 --> 02:31:55.489]  And then, let's move over to China.
[02:31:56.529 --> 02:31:59.051]  They're actually recalling all the panda bears.
[02:31:59.251 --> 02:32:02.474]  So as you know, panda bears are native only to China.
[02:32:03.755 --> 02:32:16.400]  I think something's going down pretty soon because, I mean, they want those bears back and they, I mean, it's... Yeah, that's like withdrawing your ambassadors, and they are used for propaganda purposes.
[02:32:17.340 --> 02:32:24.362]  I did see China recall their panda bears, so that shows that we're basically going to war with China.
[02:32:25.383 --> 02:32:26.463]  I totally agree, Alex.
[02:32:28.384 --> 02:32:28.864]  Anything else?
[02:32:30.249 --> 02:32:34.771]  Um, well, I think that was kind of an under-the-radar thing.
[02:32:34.911 --> 02:32:42.894]  So, when Russia first was surrounding Ukraine, one of the under-the-radar news was that they're moving the blood bank.
[02:32:43.454 --> 02:32:49.176]  So it's not just a military exercise, they're actually, you know, there's some substantial news moving blood banks.
[02:32:49.776 --> 02:32:54.058]  And then, have you heard about the Nagorno-Karabakh, like, just last week?
[02:32:54.938 --> 02:32:55.318]  The what?
[02:32:56.079 --> 02:32:56.619]  Armenia.
[02:32:57.239 --> 02:32:59.620]  Oh yeah, they're doing an Armenian genocide again.
[02:33:00.322 --> 02:33:15.306]  Yeah, and so the Armenian truck, they, that were surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh, they were, they had Russian style, you know how Russia has the Z and the V to identify their vehicles, because Ukraine's got the same exact thing, so they're not hitting their own stuff?
[02:33:16.346 --> 02:33:16.686]  Yes.
[02:33:16.786 --> 02:33:29.774]   Azerbaijan had, you know, dressed up their trucks with this sort of large lettering as sort of an under, I mean, this is, it's not, I guess it's not under the radar, but I think the, I mean, there's so much stuff going on with China.
[02:33:29.794 --> 02:33:37.815]  Taiwan also just, they just built off their new submarine, which isn't going to be actually in place for another two years.
[02:33:37.875 --> 02:33:42.896]  So, I think, I think, I mean, at the very most, you have two years before China's going in there.
[02:33:42.936 --> 02:33:44.477]  I think they're probably much sooner.
[02:33:45.817 --> 02:33:46.217]  I hear you.
[02:33:46.377 --> 02:33:47.997]  All hell is breaking loose.
[02:33:48.037 --> 02:33:48.757]  Thank you, Daniel.
[02:33:49.218 --> 02:33:55.779]  We're going to go on a break, get one more news article, talk to Michael and William, then hand the baton to the great Drew Hernandez.
[02:33:57.030 --> 02:33:58.152]  In 60 seconds when we come back.
[02:33:59.093 --> 02:34:00.917]  Don't forget, we have the War Room 3 p.m.
[02:34:00.957 --> 02:34:01.478]  Central today.
[02:34:01.498 --> 02:34:02.620]  I'm not sure who the guest host is.
[02:34:03.061 --> 02:34:06.247]  Owen's visiting with his family before he's put in prison for free speech.
[02:34:07.248 --> 02:34:09.452]  So, who is hosting the War Room today at 3 p.m.? ?
[02:34:10.796 --> 02:34:12.037]  Just please note it and tune in.
[02:34:12.757 --> 02:34:13.277]  Clay Clark.
[02:34:13.397 --> 02:34:14.057]  All right, great guy.
[02:34:14.598 --> 02:34:15.298]  All right, we'll be back.
[02:34:15.318 --> 02:34:15.718]  Stay with us.
[02:34:16.719 --> 02:34:19.600]  Derren Hernandez in a few minutes is set to take over.
[02:34:19.620 --> 02:34:24.282]  I wanted to hit these two final news stories, hit two final calls, and the baton to him, so we're gonna move quick.
[02:34:24.842 --> 02:34:26.503]  These are both extremely informative.
[02:34:27.003 --> 02:34:43.756]  So, new $4 billion Panasonic electric vehicle EV battery factory in Kansas requires so much power, the facility needs to be run by its own coal plant that Biden is allowing to stay open because the Chi-Coms and others own it.
[02:34:44.617 --> 02:34:48.700]  So see, they're only going to cut off everybody else's energy, not their own energy systems.
[02:34:49.181 --> 02:34:50.382]  Canada is doing the same thing.
[02:34:50.742 --> 02:34:51.563]  Here's another one.
[02:34:52.617 --> 02:34:53.397]  Safety first!
[02:34:54.058 --> 02:34:58.380]  Anthropology conference cancels panelists due to their harmful embrace of biological sex.
[02:34:58.981 --> 02:35:08.506]  Anyone that's written books or talked about Africa or wherever, males and females, mentioning male and female is not allowed and they're banning them from the conference.
[02:35:10.707 --> 02:35:11.788]  Total brainwashing.
[02:35:14.113 --> 02:35:14.873]  Total tyranny.
[02:35:15.234 --> 02:35:19.135]  Also, Elon Musk has fired most of Twitter's election integrity team.
[02:35:19.175 --> 02:35:19.875]  That's good news.
[02:35:20.356 --> 02:35:21.536]  Let's take two final calls.
[02:35:21.616 --> 02:35:23.777]  William, in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:35:25.658 --> 02:35:26.418]  Alex, how you doing?
[02:35:26.558 --> 02:35:26.798]  Good.
[02:35:28.019 --> 02:35:28.259]  Good.
[02:35:28.319 --> 02:35:33.541]  Hopi prophecy is being fulfilled on the right-hand path, God's path.
[02:35:33.601 --> 02:35:35.562]  And I'm here in God's country, in the Mount of Olives.
[02:35:36.022 --> 02:35:41.825]  Look, in 2018, we have had a 5G system on top of our water tower.
[02:35:42.526 --> 02:35:54.349]  And I had been badgering the DOE for months now on end, and they are constantly just hanging up on me and telling me that my information is good, but we can't do anything about it.
[02:35:55.089 --> 02:35:59.370]  The specter in the sky that is going on, it's going up everywhere.
[02:35:59.650 --> 02:36:01.231]  I mean, I'm in farm country.
[02:36:02.151 --> 02:36:05.252]  5G systems are going up everywhere, Alex.
[02:36:05.932 --> 02:36:06.412]  Everywhere.
[02:36:06.912 --> 02:36:09.953]  Yeah, because they're going to run the driverless cars off of those and the drones.
[02:36:11.326 --> 02:36:11.986]  Absolutely.
[02:36:12.066 --> 02:36:21.929]  I think it's all... That means if they kick off their drone attack, just like they're doing in England, the public takes out the 5G, and I'm not saying do that, but that's what we would do.
[02:36:21.949 --> 02:36:25.510]  People would counter the 5G and the surveillance cameras.
[02:36:26.850 --> 02:36:30.971]  We're being sprinkled with the 5G every night and day around here.
[02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:35.972]  I cannot believe how many people are just slobbering at the mouth.
[02:36:36.172 --> 02:36:38.873]  We are being bombarded by five fever.
[02:36:39.073 --> 02:36:40.554]  We've got it on top of our water tower.
[02:36:40.594 --> 02:36:43.455]  I told the DOE, I said, it's electrochemical.
[02:36:43.996 --> 02:36:45.436]  Why is it on top of our water?
[02:36:45.997 --> 02:36:47.197]  Why is it on top of our water?
[02:36:47.597 --> 02:36:53.020]  And they, they, I cannot tell you the incompetence that I talked to at the DOE switchboard.
[02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:55.901]  There is, I don't want to talk bad about people, but.
[02:36:56.581 --> 02:36:57.722]  Well, the Department of Energy?
[02:36:59.103 --> 02:36:59.963]  They're incompetent.
[02:37:00.895 --> 02:37:02.316]  How did these people get hired?
[02:37:02.676 --> 02:37:03.536]  I don't understand.
[02:37:03.576 --> 02:37:10.599]  Well, they're not in... The agreement's been made with Congress to do this, so they're rolling it out, so you're talking to somebody that doesn't have power.
[02:37:10.639 --> 02:37:11.780]  That's why they seem incompetent.
[02:37:12.100 --> 02:37:13.740]  But I hear you, and I appreciate your call, William.
[02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:14.181]  Thank you.
[02:37:15.341 --> 02:37:16.281]  Michael in Oregon.
[02:37:16.301 --> 02:37:16.782]  You're on the air.
[02:37:16.802 --> 02:37:17.182]  Go ahead.
[02:37:18.823 --> 02:37:19.023]  Yes.
[02:37:19.083 --> 02:37:20.363]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[02:37:20.503 --> 02:37:22.924]  I go by Freedom Foxtrot on Rumble.
[02:37:23.785 --> 02:37:34.933]   I'm a first-time caller, and I wanted to thank you And Mike Lindell and Pete Santilli, you guys are true American heroes for standing up.
[02:37:36.814 --> 02:37:44.400]  The previous message was kind of my question, you know, like, when are we going to actually take a stand?
[02:37:44.420 --> 02:37:46.621]  And you can't do it alone.
[02:37:46.721 --> 02:37:47.122]  You're right.
[02:37:47.402 --> 02:37:48.182]  It is up to us.
[02:37:49.383 --> 02:37:54.407]  And I don't want us to be scattered in the wind when something happens.
[02:37:55.299 --> 02:38:01.644]  And so I was hoping that we could set that up.
[02:38:02.784 --> 02:38:07.307]  Well, it'd be great to set something up where we can communicate if they turn the internet off.
[02:38:07.408 --> 02:38:11.690]  I mean, I can barely keep this operation warning people on the air.
[02:38:12.131 --> 02:38:15.553]  So I'm not some... I mean, the government can barely build a 5G takeover grid.
[02:38:15.593 --> 02:38:19.296]  I don't know what I'm supposed to build, what I'm supposed to do.
[02:38:19.356 --> 02:38:22.718]  Ken, I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
[02:38:24.642 --> 02:38:28.105]  And again, I started a channel on Rumble.
[02:38:28.125 --> 02:38:31.228]  Well, I'm glad you started a channel on Rumble.
[02:38:31.248 --> 02:38:32.369]  That's great to communicate with people.
[02:38:32.889 --> 02:38:38.434]  But how do you set up a communication system for us if they shut off the Internet?
[02:38:38.454 --> 02:38:39.435]  Can you tell me how you do that?
[02:38:40.495 --> 02:38:46.801]  Well, we would need to get people basically a plan in place of what happens.
[02:38:46.921 --> 02:38:47.241]  Okay.
[02:38:47.541 --> 02:38:48.802]  Hey, we lost power.
[02:38:48.842 --> 02:38:49.623]  This is what we do.
[02:38:49.643 --> 02:38:50.464]  This is where we meet.
[02:38:51.845 --> 02:38:52.986]  We don't have much time.
[02:38:54.085 --> 02:38:59.106]  And I pray a lot, and I will continue to pray for you every night.
[02:38:59.186 --> 02:39:00.207]  Thank you.
[02:39:00.987 --> 02:39:09.729]  But my plan would be to put a person in charge of each state, and that state meets them in a certain place.
[02:39:11.970 --> 02:39:13.050]  And I'm open to ideas.
[02:39:13.786 --> 02:39:16.747]  No, we should be having a debate about what we do if they turn the power off.
[02:39:17.267 --> 02:39:20.508]  That's why we need good governors, good legislators in place, good sheriffs that are informed.
[02:39:21.128 --> 02:39:23.769]  Because even a normal society is hard to run.
[02:39:24.089 --> 02:39:26.130]  When things break down, it's going to be all hell's going to break loose.
[02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:30.971]  Then they're going to roll out the robots, the A.I., as the answer to coordinate the collapsed society.
[02:39:31.031 --> 02:39:32.132]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:39:32.492 --> 02:39:33.172]  I'm out of time.
[02:39:33.372 --> 02:39:35.153]  Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow for the Friday edition.
[02:39:35.853 --> 02:39:36.073]  11 a.m.
[02:39:36.133 --> 02:39:36.533]  Central.
[02:39:36.833 --> 02:39:38.814]  Harrison Smith, weekdays, 8 a.m.
[02:39:38.874 --> 02:39:39.254]  Central.
[02:39:39.674 --> 02:39:41.195]  Owen Schroeder, weekdays, 3 p.m.
[02:39:41.235 --> 02:39:41.535]  Central.
[02:39:42.535 --> 02:39:49.157]  Syndicated talk show host, pastor, investigative journalist, on-the-ground reporter, Drew Hernandez takes over.
[02:39:50.438 --> 02:39:55.239]  All righty, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones, thank you for allowing me to host the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:39:55.359 --> 02:39:57.680]  I am your guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[02:39:57.700 --> 02:40:00.101]  Good to see all the InfoWarriors worldwide.
[02:40:00.141 --> 02:40:04.462]  Make sure to share all the links, band.video, InfoWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:40:04.482 --> 02:40:05.802]  Make sure to support the broadcast.
[02:40:06.143 --> 02:40:07.223]  Keep free speech alive.
[02:40:07.944 --> 02:40:13.746]  Keep InfoWars alive by supporting the broadcast and all these very imperative and important transmissions.
[02:40:14.466 --> 02:40:19.668]  I mean, you got the EU, you got the UK, you got all these globalist powers that are now coming out in their conferences.
[02:40:19.688 --> 02:40:25.990]  And they literally say, they literally say that we're in the future and we're fighting a dis-InfoWar.
[02:40:26.410 --> 02:40:30.692]  It's interesting that they use the opposite of what all of us are used to fighting every single day.
[02:40:31.112 --> 02:40:36.754]  Because they like to call everything that's truth, everything that's accurate, everything that's waking people up, red-pilling.
[02:40:37.426 --> 02:40:38.710]  Pulling people out of the matrix?
[02:40:39.654 --> 02:40:42.563]  That's exactly what disinformation means.
[02:40:43.536 --> 02:40:54.820]  To the global regime and the deep state and all of these powers that are behind the scenes pulling all the strings that are infiltrating Twitter, that are infiltrating Facebook, that are infiltrating legacy media.
[02:40:55.221 --> 02:40:57.301]  I mean, take a look at what's happened with CNN.
[02:40:57.361 --> 02:40:59.182]  Take a look at what's happened with Fox News.
[02:40:59.782 --> 02:41:08.926]  And they've forever been trying to infiltrate InfoWars, but thank God we have patriots like Alex Jones that are holding the line and not turning their back on the American people.
[02:41:09.805 --> 02:41:12.952]  And humanity and truth itself and God himself.
[02:41:13.433 --> 02:41:14.715]  Because that's where these people go.
[02:41:14.755 --> 02:41:21.689]  Eventually they'll come out to the media, slander you, they'll attack you, they'll try to discredit you and call you a conspiracy theorist.
[02:41:22.426 --> 02:41:26.848]  First, they'll launch all those attacks or they'll laugh at you and say, well, don't take them serious.
[02:41:27.309 --> 02:41:29.370]  They're just a bunch of conspiracy theorists.
[02:41:29.890 --> 02:41:30.870]  They're just psychos.
[02:41:30.910 --> 02:41:39.355]  There's some radical dude on the radio or on the internet, you know, just saying a bunch of crazy things about the government and secret societies.
[02:41:39.695 --> 02:41:41.436]  First, they'll laugh at you.
[02:41:41.456 --> 02:41:42.536]  They'll discredit you.
[02:41:42.556 --> 02:41:43.997]  They'll slander you.
[02:41:44.898 --> 02:41:47.439]  But then next, they'll try to get you to join them.
[02:41:48.243 --> 02:41:54.267]  And once they try to get you to join them, that's when you really have to stand the test of time and stand with God.
[02:41:54.287 --> 02:42:01.392]  Because when you get these satanic powers knocking on your door and saying, listen, you want all these attacks to stop?
[02:42:02.133 --> 02:42:04.074]  You see all this slander in the media?
[02:42:04.535 --> 02:42:07.136]  You see all these lies about you and your family?
[02:42:07.156 --> 02:42:17.744]  You see all these people that are lurking around your house and all these people that are lurking around whenever you go to the restaurant down the street or your wife goes grocery shopping?
[02:42:18.533 --> 02:42:22.757]  You see all these indirect threats that are happening all around you?
[02:42:23.217 --> 02:42:33.907]  Like I said, whether it's in the media, on television, on the internet, social media, politicians all in unison with the New World Order and the satanic cabal spirit of the Antichrist.
[02:42:34.888 --> 02:42:36.950]  They'll come to you and try and get you to join them.
[02:42:36.970 --> 02:42:43.136]  It's exactly what Lucifer did to Jesus in the famous temptation in the wilderness.
[02:42:44.167 --> 02:42:46.909]  But the moment you say no, that's the test of time.
[02:42:46.929 --> 02:42:56.117]  You're either going to turn your back on God and you're going to turn your back on truth and everything that's righteous that you ever stood for, or you're not.
[02:42:57.098 --> 02:43:01.302]  You're either going to turn your back on God or you're going to turn your back on these evil satanic powers.
[02:43:02.022 --> 02:43:04.304]  And there will be a consequence for both.
[02:43:04.324 --> 02:43:10.985]   If you turn your back on God, there's a huge Huge consequence that you never want to deal with.
[02:43:11.045 --> 02:43:18.327]  As a child of God, you'll never lose your salvation, but you will be disciplined, and it's not going to be pretty.
[02:43:19.187 --> 02:43:35.071]  But if you turn your back on God, you're obviously, by default, deciding to play for the team and the legions of Satan and demons and all of these satanic powers that are invisible to the naked eye.
[02:43:36.172 --> 02:43:40.912]   But you turn your back on evil, There's a reward eternally.
[02:43:41.592 --> 02:43:42.792]  God will always be with you.
[02:43:44.173 --> 02:43:50.135]  But persecution is quite literally promise to the Christian.
[02:43:51.475 --> 02:43:58.458]  You see, but this is where people's thinking has to change and it has to go to this level where, well, what do I really value most?
[02:43:59.318 --> 02:44:01.379]  Do I value being accepted by the world?
[02:44:02.459 --> 02:44:05.341]  Or do I agree with Jesus when he said, well, I am not of the world.
[02:44:05.381 --> 02:44:06.381]  You are not of the world.
[02:44:07.717 --> 02:44:09.618]  And therefore you're not going to be accepted by the world.
[02:44:10.038 --> 02:44:18.864]  You take a stand with God, you take a stand for truth, you take a stand for righteousness and true justice, you get hit hard, and that sequence will happen.
[02:44:18.884 --> 02:44:27.689]  They'll slander you, they'll try to discredit you, they'll laugh at you, they won't take you serious until you start gaining a massive audience, and you start having impacts.
[02:44:29.116 --> 02:44:37.198]  In the world, like InfoWars obviously has, especially with the 2016 election and the advent of Donald J. Trump.
[02:44:37.698 --> 02:44:38.398]  Everybody knows.
[02:44:39.078 --> 02:44:55.781]  Everybody knows InfoWars played a huge role in that election, but that's why eventually when they try and come and cut little deals with you and start selling people out and start giving us your contacts so we could federally prosecute other people, because that's what the feds do.
[02:44:56.880 --> 02:45:01.022]  Whether it's a legitimate case or not, that's what they do, it's their job, okay?
[02:45:02.743 --> 02:45:08.486]  You're either gonna turn your back on these people, if they can't get you to flip, oh, you will be punished.
[02:45:09.286 --> 02:45:12.668]  You will be severely punished by the satanic cabal.
[02:45:13.269 --> 02:45:16.130]  They will throw everything and anything they possibly can at you.
[02:45:16.330 --> 02:45:26.507]   No, it goes beyond, it goes beyond being slandered in the media, it goes beyond indirect threats of People following you on the street.
[02:45:26.567 --> 02:45:28.249]  It goes way beyond that.
[02:45:28.929 --> 02:45:33.153]  Then they turn the heat way, way through the roof.
[02:45:33.774 --> 02:45:58.208]   Then they turn the heat, they crank it all the way up, where they weaponize the full power of federal intelligence agencies, federal prosecutors, They weaponize the taxpayer money by weaponizing the government using your money by going after people that will not join their forces, that will not turn to the dark side.
[02:45:58.228 --> 02:46:00.670]  You get punished severely for that.
[02:46:00.870 --> 02:46:01.571]  And you know what?
[02:46:02.811 --> 02:46:03.732]  That's acceptable.
[02:46:04.533 --> 02:46:05.674]  And that's how it should be.
[02:46:05.694 --> 02:46:07.055]  It's not easy.
[02:46:07.815 --> 02:46:08.796]  It hurts like hell.
[02:46:09.556 --> 02:46:10.957]  It hurts like hell.
[02:46:12.118 --> 02:46:12.699]  But you know what?
[02:46:13.199 --> 02:46:14.160]  It's not actually hell.
[02:46:15.296 --> 02:46:17.878]  And there's something worse than the persecution.
[02:46:17.898 --> 02:46:23.942]  There's something worse than standing with God and getting punished for it righteously.
[02:46:23.982 --> 02:46:25.723]  That's a blessing according to the Bible.
[02:46:27.084 --> 02:46:27.824]  It's not easy.
[02:46:28.444 --> 02:46:31.947]  And I know everyone, I know everyone that's a part of Infowars knows exactly what I'm talking about.
[02:46:31.967 --> 02:46:35.329]  But you know, every now and then, I think we all need some encouragement.
[02:46:35.349 --> 02:46:44.196]   It's like, you know, if you feel like This is all useless, or you feel like, you know, jumping ship, or you feel like it would just be easier to carry on without this.
[02:46:44.276 --> 02:47:01.016]   I think, you know, people truly do view this machine as, like, when they say the tip of the spear, and I'm not just saying this because I, you know, I get to host this show, which is a great honor, and I'm obviously a fan, but I mean, like, imagine a world without Without this?
[02:47:01.657 --> 02:47:25.908]  Like, imagine a world without this information to counter the Klaus Schwab's and the Bill Gates and the World Economic Forum and the satanic UK and EU and all these psychopaths that want to roll out their cashless society digital ID passports, death jabs for all, depopulation by hacking the genitals of all humans.
[02:47:27.657 --> 02:47:31.899]  Sterilization of women in their wombs by pushing birth control down their mouths?
[02:47:33.620 --> 02:47:35.620]  Before they're even officially teenagers?
[02:47:37.121 --> 02:47:37.741]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:47:37.761 --> 02:47:38.942]  Like, there's so much information.
[02:47:38.962 --> 02:47:40.782]  I mean, the poisoning of the food and the water.
[02:47:40.983 --> 02:47:43.564]  There's so much here that's valuable, and they know it.
[02:47:43.604 --> 02:47:45.645]  That's why the attacks are so harsh.
[02:47:46.185 --> 02:47:47.025]  They're so harsh!
[02:47:47.985 --> 02:47:56.159]   I've had Alex on my shows in the past, and he's told me the stories of You know, these satanic figures that have tried to get him to join forces with them.
[02:47:56.199 --> 02:47:57.360]  You'd be more popular.
[02:47:57.581 --> 02:47:59.102]  You'll be even bigger than before.
[02:47:59.122 --> 02:48:00.183]  You'll have everything you ever wanted.
[02:48:00.203 --> 02:48:03.325]  You just gotta, you know, you just gotta tone it down and join us!
[02:48:04.727 --> 02:48:07.189]  And here's Alex Jones today, holding the line.
[02:48:07.833 --> 02:48:08.513]  Still hasn't done it.
[02:48:08.773 --> 02:48:11.034]  You know, the point is, this is the point, okay?
[02:48:12.394 --> 02:48:19.715]  The reason why you have to talk about Alex in terms of these things is because Alex InfoWars is the prototype.
[02:48:19.935 --> 02:48:21.135]  It's the prototype for the future.
[02:48:21.416 --> 02:48:27.917]  Just like InfoWars was the prototype for censorship on big tech and applications in the App Store.
[02:48:29.237 --> 02:48:33.758]  Whether it's iOS, whether it's Apple or Android, Google, you name it.
[02:48:34.018 --> 02:48:34.418]  Windows.
[02:48:35.925 --> 02:48:38.766]  Whatever the running software is, that's the future.
[02:48:38.826 --> 02:48:40.787]  And then now they spread that out to everybody else.
[02:48:40.847 --> 02:48:43.828]  Eventually, they de-platformed a sitting United States President.
[02:48:44.969 --> 02:48:47.450]  And no one compl- no- no- nothing came of that!
[02:48:48.030 --> 02:48:48.991]  Not a single thing.
[02:48:49.851 --> 02:48:50.871]  Nobody in D.C.
[02:48:50.991 --> 02:48:52.772]  It just- it- every- it was all hush-hush.
[02:48:54.013 --> 02:49:02.279]   So the future is when- when you say no to their offer to join them, Just understand, you will be severely punished.
[02:49:02.299 --> 02:49:05.501]  They will launch these three-letter intelligence agencies after you.
[02:49:06.722 --> 02:49:09.364]  They will launch their surveillance, the NSA, after you.
[02:49:09.964 --> 02:49:19.611]  They will launch the full power of the federal government with their lawfare after you and all of their satanic, crooked, sorrow-suppointed DAs.
[02:49:19.651 --> 02:49:20.511]  That's why they're there!
[02:49:21.332 --> 02:49:22.333]  They're there for you!
[02:49:23.877 --> 02:49:28.778]  You think they're there just because they want to get the upper hand and they want to gain more ground?
[02:49:28.818 --> 02:49:31.658]  Why do you think Soros has been doing this for the past few decades?
[02:49:33.119 --> 02:49:33.719]  It's for now.
[02:49:33.759 --> 02:49:34.499]  It's for today.
[02:49:34.519 --> 02:49:46.081]  And so when they finally launch their attacks through lawfare or legally and weaponizing the full power of the authoritarian federal government, everything is already installed and in place.
[02:49:46.121 --> 02:49:48.342]  That's why they are going with what they are going with Trump.
[02:49:49.242 --> 02:49:56.546]   That's why they're going with what they're going with Everyone that is getting hit in InfoWars or any Patriot that's having to deal with the Feds right now.
[02:49:57.807 --> 02:49:58.667]  They've all been installed.
[02:49:58.687 --> 02:50:00.288]  Did you guys see the story the other day?
[02:50:00.308 --> 02:50:02.490]  I think it was Gateway Pundit.
[02:50:03.290 --> 02:50:04.331]  I didn't send it to you guys.
[02:50:04.391 --> 02:50:05.391]  It just came to mind right now.
[02:50:05.411 --> 02:50:06.092]  I think it was.
[02:50:06.152 --> 02:50:08.113]  It was either Gateway Pundit or Post Millennial.
[02:50:08.693 --> 02:50:10.534]  One of the J6 prosecutors.
[02:50:11.695 --> 02:50:14.737]  He attempted to stab a man or stab somebody.
[02:50:15.723 --> 02:50:16.684]  On the highway?
[02:50:16.704 --> 02:50:19.566]  Because it hit his car?
[02:50:19.587 --> 02:50:23.910]  These are the satanic people we're dealing with right now.
[02:50:25.652 --> 02:50:26.873]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:50:26.893 --> 02:50:28.174]  But that's why they're appointed.
[02:50:29.275 --> 02:50:30.436]  That's why they're installed.
[02:50:31.777 --> 02:50:37.783]  Because once they get on the other side of determining your fate, it's not going to be a righteous judgment, it's not going to be justice.
[02:50:38.663 --> 02:50:45.827]  It's not going to be the right thing, no matter how clear things may be or how vindicated you might show yourself to be.
[02:50:45.847 --> 02:50:51.350]  That's essentially the life of Jesus.
[02:50:52.650 --> 02:50:55.932]  Innocence crucified over lies.
[02:50:56.472 --> 02:50:58.494]  Slander, misinformation.
[02:50:58.514 --> 02:50:58.834]  There it is.
[02:50:58.854 --> 02:51:01.795]  Ex-federal prosecutor accused of bizarre road rage stabbing.
[02:51:01.835 --> 02:51:02.536]  Well, there you go.
[02:51:04.117 --> 02:51:04.757]  That's great.
[02:51:05.655 --> 02:51:13.759]  Oh yeah, I feel totally safe with prosecutors like that floating around, going after, you know, Americans that were walking around.
[02:51:16.521 --> 02:51:19.482]  Any capital in the United States of America, you see what I'm saying?
[02:51:19.502 --> 02:51:21.643]  But that's how the regime has to function.
[02:51:22.304 --> 02:51:24.285]  It's the whole defund the police agenda.
[02:51:25.085 --> 02:51:28.427]  I think a lot of people didn't quite understand what defund the police truly was.
[02:51:29.027 --> 02:51:32.209]  Defund the police was not just like, let's usher in total anarchy in the West.
[02:51:33.228 --> 02:51:41.315]  Let's just remove police departments, lawlessness will abound, and we'll have a full-blown destabilization, federal intervention.
[02:51:41.335 --> 02:51:49.642]  I would say that's maybe about 85% of what Defund the Police truly was.
[02:51:50.443 --> 02:51:53.185]  Because Defund the Police truly was a regime installation.
[02:51:54.286 --> 02:51:59.651]  And it also was to vet out, to filter out the good guys.
[02:52:00.666 --> 02:52:07.449]  To filter out the good women of the badge every day that wake up every day and could be their last day.
[02:52:08.449 --> 02:52:13.432]  Increasingly at a higher percentage as a police officer with their family.
[02:52:14.612 --> 02:52:19.114]  Because they have taken an oath to serve and protect their communities.
[02:52:19.774 --> 02:52:20.775]  And they take that seriously.
[02:52:20.795 --> 02:52:21.655]  They're not corrupt.
[02:52:22.015 --> 02:52:23.296]  They're not all gay and woke.
[02:52:24.221 --> 02:52:27.383]  They are upholding the law, and that's biblical.
[02:52:27.423 --> 02:52:31.707]  That is a God-given position in a civilization.
[02:52:32.167 --> 02:52:34.068]  To be a police officer is a very serious thing.
[02:52:34.089 --> 02:52:37.631]  It doesn't matter where you are, in the United States, anywhere on the globe.
[02:52:38.212 --> 02:52:39.312]  The Bible is very clear on that.
[02:52:39.352 --> 02:52:46.458]  You take a look at Romans chapter 13, chapter 12 in those areas, and you take a look at the one that bears the sword.
[02:52:47.353 --> 02:52:51.276]  To punish evildoers and, you know, protect the righteous and uphold justice.
[02:52:51.296 --> 02:52:54.559]  It's a very, it's a very sacred position in society.
[02:52:54.919 --> 02:53:01.165]  But that's why that has also been attacked and perverted by the satanic Luciferians here in this country.
[02:53:01.825 --> 02:53:13.555]  But ultimately, because of that reason, if you get police officers, if you infiltrate and install and remove, remove and install, just think of it like a, like your next iOS update.
[02:53:14.631 --> 02:53:15.692]  Or your Windows update.
[02:53:16.193 --> 02:53:17.314]  Remove the old files.
[02:53:17.814 --> 02:53:19.076]  Remove the old drivers.
[02:53:19.656 --> 02:53:20.757]  And get in the new file.
[02:53:21.078 --> 02:53:22.038]  Get in the new update.
[02:53:22.299 --> 02:53:23.320]  Get in the new drivers.
[02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:25.482]  That's what defund the police essentially is.
[02:53:25.722 --> 02:53:27.164]  And they're doing this with the military.
[02:53:27.604 --> 02:53:30.547]  They've obviously been doing this with politics in D.C.
[02:53:30.567 --> 02:53:32.509]  They've been doing this with education.
[02:53:32.529 --> 02:53:34.251]  They've been doing this with the arts.
[02:53:34.851 --> 02:53:35.472]  In the culture.
[02:53:35.672 --> 02:53:36.273]  With music.
[02:53:36.893 --> 02:53:48.448]  Hollywood, you name it, it's a total reinstallation of psychopath globalists, psychopath heartless, without a conscience, commies, socialists, luciferians.
[02:53:48.889 --> 02:53:52.614]  They have to get people in there that have no conscience.
[02:53:52.634 --> 02:54:03.345]   They have to get An army of reprobates in order to uphold the satanic, demonic, murderous orders that they will deploy on humanity.
[02:54:03.645 --> 02:54:04.426]  It's the only way.
[02:54:04.886 --> 02:54:06.947]  You see, 2020 truly was a test run.
[02:54:07.767 --> 02:54:14.290]  Because you can't have a murderous, serial killing, authoritative regime if they have somewhat of a conscience.
[02:54:14.671 --> 02:54:16.391]  That's why they love AI, dude.
[02:54:16.792 --> 02:54:18.372]  That's why they love robotics.
[02:54:18.853 --> 02:54:26.475]   And it's not because they want to innovate and push humanity further into A technological advancement.
[02:54:26.535 --> 02:54:27.636]  That's the... No, no, no.
[02:54:27.656 --> 02:54:32.977]  When these Satanists and Luciferians look at technology, they only see one thing.
[02:54:32.997 --> 02:54:33.857]  They see a weapon.
[02:54:34.157 --> 02:54:36.577]  And it's not a weapon to defend ourselves from evil.
[02:54:38.038 --> 02:54:40.418]  It's a weapon to go on the offense against the innocent.
[02:54:41.619 --> 02:54:44.079]  And so when you take a look at when you see they're all... And you see this!
[02:54:44.499 --> 02:54:46.520]  You see Klaus Schwab, he talks like this openly!
[02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:53.241]  And I know I say this a lot, but I gotta repeat it, because I know there's always new viewers coming in and listening, and they're getting... Guys, because I get emails.
[02:54:54.355 --> 02:54:56.117]  I get emails all the time, you guys.
[02:54:57.678 --> 02:55:02.643]  So, you know, if you ever hear us repeat something, it's not because we don't have anything else to say.
[02:55:02.703 --> 02:55:06.226]  It's just we're fully aware there's constantly new viewers that are getting redpilled.
[02:55:07.507 --> 02:55:08.648]  You guys gotta understand that.
[02:55:08.668 --> 02:55:11.511]  Like, they flow into the shows, and I get emails all the time.
[02:55:11.551 --> 02:55:12.832]  Dude, I hooded you for the first time.
[02:55:12.852 --> 02:55:16.335]  I woke up, and okay, awesome, let's go.
[02:55:16.415 --> 02:55:17.336]  Join the army.
[02:55:17.376 --> 02:55:17.716]  Let's go.
[02:55:18.077 --> 02:55:18.697]  Endless now.
[02:55:18.717 --> 02:55:19.958]  Let's go after Skynet.
[02:55:19.998 --> 02:55:20.579]  Now's the time.
[02:55:22.153 --> 02:55:26.574]  We don't only need one John Connor, we need a billion John Connors, you know?
[02:55:26.674 --> 02:55:28.354]  That's what InfoWars is!
[02:55:30.775 --> 02:55:40.516]  But anyways, the point is, when you watch the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, Noah Yuval Harari, it's like they're on the verge of an orgasm.
[02:55:40.536 --> 02:55:42.757]  You guys notice that?
[02:55:43.657 --> 02:55:50.118]  Whenever they have their technology panels, I think it was the World Government Summit in 2023, this past one, was it Dubai?
[02:55:51.673 --> 02:55:52.774]  Yeah, I think it was Dubai.
[02:55:54.115 --> 02:55:58.157]  Where Klaus Schwab gets up there and he's just talking about mastering the future.
[02:55:59.698 --> 02:56:03.821]  Those who master these new technologies will become masters of the future.
[02:56:03.841 --> 02:56:12.126]  And you got Noah Yuval Harari just foaming at the mouth with AI infiltrating the minds mixed with VR or AR technology.
[02:56:12.975 --> 02:56:15.076]  Just rewrite the Bible, you know?
[02:56:15.296 --> 02:56:17.837]  We could write a new AI religion?
[02:56:17.917 --> 02:56:20.118]  I mean, who needs God anymore?
[02:56:20.758 --> 02:56:22.298]  But that's where this all comes from.
[02:56:22.759 --> 02:56:24.779]  The origin of Satan, it's all Luciferian.
[02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:36.243]  But the reason for it is, yes, to cause mass destabilization, but they need a reprobate, depraved society that has no conscience at all.
[02:56:36.584 --> 02:56:37.204]  Zero.
[02:56:37.804 --> 02:56:38.944]  Zero conscience.
[02:56:40.065 --> 02:56:40.425]  Zero.
[02:56:41.147 --> 02:56:44.128]  To carry out the murderous orders of the New World Order.
[02:56:44.168 --> 02:56:47.468]  And that's what they're, that's what they're slowly developing on right now.
[02:56:48.028 --> 02:56:49.449]  They're slowly rolling that out.
[02:56:49.949 --> 02:56:51.589]  And you're seeing that with the depravity.
[02:56:51.609 --> 02:56:53.489]  You're seeing that with the total immorality.
[02:56:53.870 --> 02:56:55.650]  You're seeing that with the rollout of atheism.
[02:56:56.050 --> 02:56:57.470]  And they are raising up their army.
[02:56:58.030 --> 02:56:58.771]  We got ours too.
[02:56:58.791 --> 02:57:00.291]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:00.951 --> 02:57:01.971]  Count the cost.
[02:57:03.351 --> 02:57:07.492]  Ladies and gentlemen, count the cost.
[02:57:09.133 --> 02:57:10.593]  The words of Jesus Christ.
[02:57:11.923 --> 02:57:18.786]  I think every single one of us has to really decide if this is a fight we really want to be in.
[02:57:18.806 --> 02:57:21.708]  I got to remind myself that every single day.
[02:57:21.728 --> 02:57:33.054]  You start, you know, realizing you got, you got, you know, you got family members, you got people reaching out to you saying, Hey man, I was at an airport and they stopped me and they were asking me about you.
[02:57:33.114 --> 02:57:37.676]  And I asked why, and they said, well, you might be a part of right-wing domestic terrorism.
[02:57:37.716 --> 02:57:41.418]  It's like, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta really start to count the cost.
[02:57:42.631 --> 02:57:47.733]  And I know all of you are, but make sure to pray for InfoWars.
[02:57:48.634 --> 02:57:53.756]  Pray for Owen Schroyer and his family, and all the other patriots that are being targeted right now.
[02:57:53.796 --> 02:57:56.257]  But it comes with the territory, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:57.978 --> 02:58:05.721]  We don't just speak out against tyranny and not expect some mass retaliation, because the mass retaliation, it'll come.
[02:58:06.622 --> 02:58:11.304]  Once they try to slander you, discredit you, save InfoWars, donate today.
[02:58:12.392 --> 02:58:19.054]  Support the broadcast, support the info war, the law fair that's going on with everybody.
[02:58:19.074 --> 02:58:22.434]  Infowars, store.com.
[02:58:22.974 --> 02:58:25.235]  Guys, this is the real deal.
[02:58:25.315 --> 02:58:26.095]  This is it.
[02:58:26.655 --> 02:58:27.255]  We're living it.
[02:58:28.156 --> 02:58:32.397]  We're living the preliminary rollouts of what's to come.
[02:58:33.477 --> 02:58:34.417]  The future is now.
[02:58:35.417 --> 02:58:37.698]  The future is now and the future is happening today.
[02:58:39.241 --> 02:58:41.202]  So we thank every single one of you guys that are here.
[02:58:41.682 --> 02:58:42.203]  It's incredible.
[02:58:42.223 --> 02:58:44.104]  It's an honor to be here with every one of you.
[02:58:45.464 --> 02:58:46.625]  But things are amplifying.
[02:58:46.965 --> 02:58:51.288]  Because once you reject them and you don't join the dark side, oh man, they launch the full force.
[02:58:51.308 --> 02:58:53.069]  They launch the full force.
[02:58:53.109 --> 02:58:54.289]  And you feel the wrath.
[02:58:54.930 --> 02:58:56.611]  The wrath of the tyrannical regime.
[02:58:58.692 --> 02:59:01.613]  So you're reminded not to ever step up to them ever again.
[02:59:01.833 --> 02:59:03.594]  You won't join them, but we will destroy you.
[02:59:03.754 --> 02:59:04.575]  That's their thinking.
[02:59:05.666 --> 02:59:06.386]  That's their thinking.
[02:59:06.406 --> 02:59:07.867]  You're either with us or you're against us.
[02:59:07.927 --> 02:59:09.568]  It's the same mentality that Jesus has.
[02:59:09.588 --> 02:59:12.450]  Either for me or you're against me.
[02:59:12.470 --> 02:59:14.211]  There's no middle ground on either side.
[02:59:14.231 --> 02:59:15.232]  It's good versus evil.
[02:59:16.432 --> 02:59:17.513]  And people need to pick a side.
[02:59:17.553 --> 02:59:18.354]  It's that simple, dude.
[02:59:18.374 --> 02:59:19.494]  You just pick a side, man.
[02:59:19.754 --> 02:59:20.495]  What side are you on?
[02:59:21.635 --> 02:59:22.196]  Good or evil?
[02:59:22.356 --> 02:59:23.116]  It's very simple.
[02:59:24.097 --> 02:59:25.778]  And you gotta make that choice every single day.
[02:59:27.019 --> 02:59:29.320]  And if you stand for good, get ready for some persecution, man.
[02:59:29.340 --> 02:59:29.820]  It's not easy.
[02:59:29.860 --> 02:59:30.401]  It's not easy.
[02:59:30.621 --> 02:59:31.521]  You're gonna be tempted.
[02:59:31.741 --> 02:59:39.064]   The temptation To give up, the temptation to let go, and just cop out and right off into the sunset.
[02:59:40.224 --> 02:59:41.085]  It doesn't matter, man.
[02:59:41.605 --> 02:59:50.091]  No matter where you go, no matter where you hide, no matter where you try to find neutrality, you're never gonna find it.
[02:59:51.012 --> 02:59:56.916]  Until you make your peace with God, and you give your life to Christ, and you have that eternal neutrality.
[02:59:57.116 --> 03:00:03.487]   To understand that no matter what happens, if I die, if I get assassinated, I will live forever!
[03:00:04.527 --> 03:00:05.648]  There is no jailing!
[03:00:06.389 --> 03:00:09.431]  There is no imprisonment!
[03:00:11.032 --> 03:00:16.495]  Of course there is here, on this side of humanity, but there is eternal freedom in Christ.
[03:00:18.037 --> 03:00:20.958]  And that's the hope you gotta hold on to in the midst of everything.
[03:00:21.659 --> 03:00:24.741]  Not just trials and tribulations, but mass persecution.
[03:00:25.702 --> 03:00:26.522]  You'll lose your mind.
[03:00:27.603 --> 03:00:28.463]  You'll lose your sanity.
[03:00:29.304 --> 03:00:34.896]   You can't make sense of any of it, Unless you fundamentally understand you are not dealing with political entities.
[03:00:35.416 --> 03:00:44.205]  You are dealing with demonic entities that are out to seek, kill, and destroy you and your legacy that comes after you.
[03:00:44.525 --> 03:00:54.015]  That's what this is all about because ultimately this is about killing everything that God loves and that God represents and that God has created.
[03:00:54.950 --> 03:01:01.672]  Stealing, raping, killing, obliterating, destroying, dismantling, scorched earth policy.
[03:01:03.232 --> 03:01:13.875]  Climate change, death cult, they claim to carry oh so much of saving the ozone and making sure that we don't get incinerated by the sun, when in reality they'll just obliterate you if you don't comply.
[03:01:13.895 --> 03:01:27.044]   But speaking of things accelerating, The UK passes sweeping new surveillance and censorship measures in the online safety bill.
[03:01:27.444 --> 03:01:32.627]  But what's interesting about this UK online safety bill, it's a pretty long and extensive article.
[03:01:32.647 --> 03:01:34.848]  I encourage you guys to go read it later.
[03:01:35.789 --> 03:01:42.692]  But to give you guys just the quick breakdown, what they're claiming in this bill is it's always the same old story.
[03:01:43.092 --> 03:01:46.034]  This is for safety on the internet.
[03:01:46.554 --> 03:01:50.544]   This is to prevent children From being trafficked.
[03:01:50.604 --> 03:01:52.945]  This is to prevent child pornography.
[03:01:53.465 --> 03:01:59.429]  This is to prevent anything online that may be illegal that might hurt someone in the real world.
[03:02:00.269 --> 03:02:07.273]  That's all up and down in this UK online safety bill.
[03:02:07.533 --> 03:02:22.268]   But what's interesting is they're proposing it by using government software to be able to infiltrate Bypass your devices by looking into your encrypted apps.
[03:02:23.389 --> 03:02:28.676]  So what... Here you are, the UK, and what the New World Order is proposing, and this is what they always do.
[03:02:28.716 --> 03:02:29.537]  They always do this.
[03:02:29.557 --> 03:02:32.200]  They always do it in the name of safety and security.
[03:02:32.220 --> 03:02:33.202]  It's like the Patriot Act.
[03:02:33.362 --> 03:02:33.923]  Everything else.
[03:02:34.563 --> 03:02:35.425]  Even the death jabs.
[03:02:36.505 --> 03:02:37.886]  And the mandates that followed.
[03:02:38.026 --> 03:02:38.967]  This is for safety.
[03:02:39.027 --> 03:02:39.867]  Lock down in your house.
[03:02:39.887 --> 03:02:44.950]  It's for safety and security and you're gonna stay home and save lives and you're gonna be a great person.
[03:02:45.511 --> 03:02:46.872]  But let me ask you one thing.
[03:02:47.172 --> 03:02:52.835]  When the hell... When the hell did the New World Order start caring about the safety of children?
[03:02:53.376 --> 03:02:54.336]  Can anybody tell me that?
[03:02:55.557 --> 03:03:04.583]  When the... I thought according to the New World Order and these satanic globalists all in the media, they tell me that all child pedophile rings don't exist.
[03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:06.521]  Child pornography?
[03:03:06.661 --> 03:03:07.062]  Oh, come on.
[03:03:07.082 --> 03:03:07.462]  What do you mean?
[03:03:07.482 --> 03:03:07.962]  What do you mean?
[03:03:07.982 --> 03:03:10.385]  That stuff's all a bunch of conspiracy.
[03:03:10.605 --> 03:03:13.108]  There's no such thing out there as, like, child trafficking.
[03:03:13.328 --> 03:03:14.329]  None of that's happening!
[03:03:14.649 --> 03:03:15.690]  Especially on the internet.
[03:03:15.710 --> 03:03:17.032]  The internet is such a great place!
[03:03:18.720 --> 03:03:21.281]  So that's how you know this is a bunch of BS, okay?
[03:03:21.521 --> 03:03:23.001]  These people don't care about children.
[03:03:23.201 --> 03:03:24.601]  They love murdering babies.
[03:03:24.621 --> 03:03:28.422]  They love murdering babies inside and outside the womb.
[03:03:28.742 --> 03:03:30.183]  They sacrifice children.
[03:03:30.363 --> 03:03:36.444]  They offer up the blood of unborn babies and the born babies.
[03:03:36.464 --> 03:03:40.025]  They offer up their blood to the satanic gods of Moloch and Lucifer.
[03:03:41.912 --> 03:03:42.653]  So give me a break.
[03:03:42.673 --> 03:03:46.957]  These people don't give a damn about children, but that's how they offer up this online safety bill.
[03:03:47.358 --> 03:03:49.059]  But what's the actual operation?
[03:03:49.099 --> 03:04:03.534]  The actual operation is that they're proposing that the government, okay, and when they say government, they're talking about a world government, like the UK and the EU, the United Nations, that they make the decision for various different countries.
[03:04:04.742 --> 03:04:12.903]  As to whether they make the decision as to whether it's justifiable to basically hack into your device and start looking at all of your encrypted apps.
[03:04:13.864 --> 03:04:24.025]  Because they say, well, we have to make the decision because if there's something bad on that app, if there's child pornography or anything like that, if it's, if it's something that is illegal, that's the terminology.
[03:04:25.005 --> 03:04:26.986]  See, but this is where, how they slip it in.
[03:04:27.686 --> 03:04:31.106]  Because they'll do it in the name of, oh, it's saving children and this and that.
[03:04:31.147 --> 03:04:31.287]  Yeah.
[03:04:31.327 --> 03:04:32.687]  They care about children, right guys?
[03:04:32.747 --> 03:04:33.307]  No, they don't.
[03:04:33.627 --> 03:04:33.887]  Okay.
[03:04:35.488 --> 03:04:36.609]  It's a Trojan horse.
[03:04:37.950 --> 03:04:44.175]  Okay, for us to sit here and think that that's not going to be weaponized in the future, because obviously it is, and then it goes further and further and further from there.
[03:04:44.195 --> 03:04:48.458]  They want to shut down the internet, they want to monopolize the internet, they want to centralize the internet.
[03:04:48.658 --> 03:04:51.881]  This is going to go way beyond just getting banned outside of the Apple Store.
[03:04:52.962 --> 03:04:53.682]  It already has.
[03:04:55.123 --> 03:04:55.744]  It already has.
[03:04:55.784 --> 03:04:58.106]  They're already installing the infrastructure for all of this.
[03:04:58.566 --> 03:04:59.407]  You have no privacy.
[03:05:01.098 --> 03:05:02.699]  Of course this is gonna get politicized.
[03:05:02.899 --> 03:05:07.242]  What, you trust the New World Order to be able to make the decision whether it's right to hack your device or not?
[03:05:08.342 --> 03:05:09.163]  Like, yeah, of course.
[03:05:09.203 --> 03:05:12.245]  Go find the pedophiles and those that are pushing child pornography.
[03:05:12.525 --> 03:05:14.246]  They deserve to have their devices hacked.
[03:05:14.266 --> 03:05:17.648]  And I don't even think pedophiles should be thrown in prison.
[03:05:18.408 --> 03:05:19.789]  I think they should just be, like, hung.
[03:05:21.650 --> 03:05:21.930]  You know?
[03:05:21.950 --> 03:05:24.672]  I think they should just get the death penalty straight up, you know?
[03:05:24.692 --> 03:05:26.553]  It's the only way to communicate to a society.
[03:05:26.573 --> 03:05:28.074]  You're not gonna rape children.
[03:05:30.276 --> 03:05:30.897]  That's just me.
[03:05:32.138 --> 03:05:38.561]  So of course, but of course they're gonna, this is the preliminary installments of the surveillance state.
[03:05:39.702 --> 03:06:07.370]   The NSA, they already have the ability to hack your phones, and I know everyone at Infowars knows this, they already have the ability to monitor and surveil your phones and your cell phones and your conversations and your text messages, but now the UK is calling to have government authority to be able to hack your device at any time they want to in order to Take a look at your encrypted apps because they have decided that it's justifiable because you might have bad content on there.
[03:06:07.390 --> 03:06:20.573]  Yeah, like that's not gonna get weaponized when it comes to a bioweapon, when they launch the new pathogen, or whatever it is, whatever's on your phone, any misinformation, disinformation, it's all gonna go in that direction.
[03:06:20.793 --> 03:06:22.853]  It always has and it always will.
[03:06:23.853 --> 03:06:27.134]  They want to regulate your entire mind.
[03:06:28.402 --> 03:06:30.363]  That's why they will invade your devices.
[03:06:30.403 --> 03:06:32.424]  They will invade a neural link in your brain.
[03:06:32.764 --> 03:06:33.525]  It's inevitable.
[03:06:33.725 --> 03:06:34.525]  They won't stop.
[03:06:34.686 --> 03:06:35.466]  They can't stop.
[03:06:35.606 --> 03:06:36.407]  They're satanic!
[03:06:36.567 --> 03:06:37.347]  They're satanic!
[03:06:37.367 --> 03:06:38.188]  That's who they are!
[03:06:38.208 --> 03:06:40.189]  Who they'll always be unless they repent.
[03:06:40.429 --> 03:06:40.969]  I'll be right back.
[03:06:41.950 --> 03:06:43.531]  This is the future, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:06:43.551 --> 03:06:44.451]  You are in the future.
[03:06:44.471 --> 03:06:46.432]  You're living the future.
[03:06:47.353 --> 03:06:53.036]  Every single day as we go on and on and on and on, we get closer and closer and closer.
[03:06:53.666 --> 03:07:00.586]  I wanna thank every single one of you guys for tuning in to the fourth hour of the most banned transmission on the face of the globe and the universe.
[03:07:01.405 --> 03:07:02.946]  The fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:02.986 --> 03:07:04.146]  I'm your guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[03:07:04.186 --> 03:07:07.727]  I want to invite you guys to follow me on Twitter, at Drew H. Live.
[03:07:07.747 --> 03:07:10.168]  You guys can watch my nightly show on Rumble.
[03:07:10.348 --> 03:07:12.229]  Rumble.com slash Drew Hernandez.
[03:07:12.769 --> 03:07:14.830]  I go live Monday through Friday at 8 p.m.
[03:07:14.850 --> 03:07:15.250]  Pacific.
[03:07:15.270 --> 03:07:15.950]  That's 11 p.m.
[03:07:16.010 --> 03:07:17.351]  Eastern Standard Time.
[03:07:17.371 --> 03:07:18.671]  I got a bunch of other cool shows.
[03:07:19.211 --> 03:07:22.052]  Just click the link in my bio on Twitter, at Drew H. Live.
[03:07:22.212 --> 03:07:24.653]  I'm on Censor.tv, LFATV as well.
[03:07:25.273 --> 03:07:25.953]  We get based.
[03:07:26.013 --> 03:07:37.378]   But let's continue to get into this analysis because I think it's, uh, I think it's a development that's obviously developing because of the election.
[03:07:38.078 --> 03:07:44.584]  And we know when there's an election coming up, they're going to ramp up their efforts.
[03:07:45.865 --> 03:07:51.030]  And their efforts to censor and their operations to silence opposition.
[03:07:51.090 --> 03:07:52.551]  And we know Google talked about this.
[03:07:53.572 --> 03:07:54.733]  Remember at the end of the 2016 election?
[03:07:56.474 --> 03:08:04.561]  And Google had a powwow, they had a whole meeting where they're all crying and all those leaked documents, they're all crying like, how could we let this happen?
[03:08:04.581 --> 03:08:05.842]  This will never happen again!
[03:08:05.862 --> 03:08:08.505]  And they were serious about it.
[03:08:09.185 --> 03:08:11.847]  You are seeing the mass censorship everywhere, it's increasing.
[03:08:12.188 --> 03:08:16.672]  I personally don't think Twitter 2.0 is... I mean, Twitter 2.0 is no different for me, I'll be honest with you.
[03:08:16.692 --> 03:08:18.753]  I have over 300,000 followers.
[03:08:18.773 --> 03:08:20.355]  You want to know what my daily impressions are?
[03:08:21.230 --> 03:08:21.751]  An average?
[03:08:21.771 --> 03:08:23.652]  I'm gonna be totally honest with you.
[03:08:24.173 --> 03:08:26.855]  Like between 7 and 9,000 a post?
[03:08:27.756 --> 03:08:28.016]  Okay?
[03:08:28.376 --> 03:08:31.579]  You wanna know what my last Twitter, my last ex-payout was?
[03:08:32.159 --> 03:08:33.541]  It was $20, bro!
[03:08:34.001 --> 03:08:34.882]  Let's go!
[03:08:35.402 --> 03:08:37.023]  Let's go!
[03:08:37.044 --> 03:08:37.484]  $20, baby!
[03:08:38.104 --> 03:08:40.667]  Twitter 2.0 just got me 20 more dollars richer!
[03:08:40.687 --> 03:08:41.828]  I'm lovin' it!
[03:08:42.388 --> 03:08:46.511]  I personally just don't believe, you know, freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom of reach.
[03:08:46.551 --> 03:08:48.133]  I just think that's psychotic!
[03:08:48.757 --> 03:08:55.900]  You know, to let a billionaire just kind of redefine the United States Constitution and the First Amendment, but... When Elon does something good, good Elon.
[03:08:55.920 --> 03:08:56.420]  Okay?
[03:08:56.440 --> 03:08:58.521]  When Elon does something bad, bad Elon.
[03:08:58.621 --> 03:09:02.202]  I just... I hold the guy accountable, so... Anyways.
[03:09:02.743 --> 03:09:05.684]  But obviously, I don't know if you guys watched the debate last night.
[03:09:05.724 --> 03:09:06.864]  I mean, it wasn't even a debate.
[03:09:07.865 --> 03:09:08.965]  It was so cringe.
[03:09:09.385 --> 03:09:10.806]  You had Fat Christy up there.
[03:09:10.866 --> 03:09:15.588]  Like, the guy has to at least be somewhere around 400 pounds at this point, or maybe even more.
[03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:18.021]  He's just the donut king.
[03:09:18.041 --> 03:09:22.722]  This dude thought he had one-liners.
[03:09:22.762 --> 03:09:24.023]  He thought he had it in the bag.
[03:09:24.043 --> 03:09:26.584]  He's like, you know, Donald, you've been ducking all of us.
[03:09:27.964 --> 03:09:28.645]  You've been ducking.
[03:09:30.225 --> 03:09:32.526]  You've been ducking us and not showing up to the debate.
[03:09:33.887 --> 03:09:35.467]  We're not going to call you Donald Trump anymore.
[03:09:37.928 --> 03:09:38.909]  Like, dude, are you okay?
[03:09:39.109 --> 03:09:39.549]  You okay?
[03:09:41.056 --> 03:09:41.316]  I got it!
[03:09:41.516 --> 03:09:42.817]  We're gonna call you Donald Duck!
[03:09:43.598 --> 03:09:44.678]  Oh, whoa!
[03:09:44.738 --> 03:09:45.499]  Watch out!
[03:09:46.739 --> 03:09:47.780]  They got Nikki Haley.
[03:09:47.820 --> 03:09:48.681]  She's just nagging.
[03:09:49.301 --> 03:09:51.602]  You know, I live-streamed it last night.
[03:09:51.642 --> 03:09:54.384]  I was like, Nikki... Nikki the nagger.
[03:09:54.624 --> 03:09:55.865]  That nagging nagger.
[03:09:55.885 --> 03:09:57.046]  It's annoying.
[03:09:57.226 --> 03:09:58.506]  Aren't naggers annoying, guys?
[03:09:58.526 --> 03:10:00.548]  And that's all I get from Nikki Haley.
[03:10:00.568 --> 03:10:02.429]  She's just an annoying nagger.
[03:10:02.449 --> 03:10:05.050]  You know, she just nags and nags and nags.
[03:10:05.651 --> 03:10:06.651]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:10:06.691 --> 03:10:07.692]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:10:08.416 --> 03:10:09.716]  He had like Mike Pence last night.
[03:10:09.736 --> 03:10:14.278]  This guy comes out and is like, I've been, I've been sleeping with a teacher for like 30 years.
[03:10:14.338 --> 03:10:15.598]  Like, dude, nobody wanted that image.
[03:10:15.738 --> 03:10:20.179]  Nobody wanted that image of you and your wife naked banging in Ukraine.
[03:10:20.199 --> 03:10:20.799]  Okay, dude.
[03:10:21.620 --> 03:10:23.060]  Anyways, it was a total clown show.
[03:10:23.080 --> 03:10:25.941]  And you had Vivek up there saying everyone on the stage is good.
[03:10:25.961 --> 03:10:26.621]  These are good people.
[03:10:26.781 --> 03:10:27.441]  These are good people.
[03:10:27.721 --> 03:10:29.202]  All these people are good.
[03:10:29.242 --> 03:10:31.782]  He's almost like an Indian Ben Shapiro almost.
[03:10:31.842 --> 03:10:32.643]  Kind of weird, you know?
[03:10:32.663 --> 03:10:33.803]  I don't know.
[03:10:33.843 --> 03:10:34.123]  Kind of.
[03:10:34.803 --> 03:10:37.624]  Someone should like make like an AI generated photo of Vivek.
[03:10:38.496 --> 03:10:45.278]  Doesn't he kind of come off like a, you know, cause Ben Shapiro's like this robotic, just talking head, like lack of personality.
[03:10:46.938 --> 03:10:53.760]  He's like an Indian, Hindu or whatever, you know, but whatever, dude, it's a total joke.
[03:10:53.780 --> 03:10:54.681]  The whole thing's a joke.
[03:10:54.921 --> 03:10:59.082]  I don't know anyways, but, but before the debate, there were attacks.
[03:10:59.102 --> 03:11:03.323]  You're going to continue to see this, uh, because the censors are trying to gain control.
[03:11:04.193 --> 03:11:05.495]  Of the alternative platforms.
[03:11:05.515 --> 03:11:09.299]  That's why there's so much lawfare getting launched against InfoWars and Bandot Video.
[03:11:09.339 --> 03:11:14.245]  They're trying to drown InfoWars, Alex Jones out, trying to drown them out entirely.
[03:11:14.546 --> 03:11:16.668]  So they're never heard of ever again.
[03:11:16.688 --> 03:11:20.153]  They tell you, ha ha ha, go build your own platform.
[03:11:20.313 --> 03:11:21.194]  Yeah, and they come for you.
[03:11:22.358 --> 03:11:24.599]  And the psychos come for you and they drag you back.
[03:11:24.860 --> 03:11:30.723]  They try to drag you while you put your, your, your, your, your fingers and your nails into the ground and they're dragging you.
[03:11:30.763 --> 03:11:31.224]  Come back!
[03:11:31.544 --> 03:11:32.124]  Come back!
[03:11:32.425 --> 03:11:34.026]  You're not gonna go build your platform!
[03:11:34.706 --> 03:11:35.827]  Get over here!
[03:11:36.307 --> 03:11:37.508]  Like Mortal Kombat, you know?
[03:11:37.528 --> 03:11:40.970]  That's... You can't go... They're not serious.
[03:11:40.990 --> 03:11:42.871]  Because when you go do it, they start coming after you.
[03:11:44.432 --> 03:11:46.614]  But this is an article by the AP.
[03:11:46.754 --> 03:11:47.774]  This was right before the debate.
[03:11:47.794 --> 03:11:49.455]  I thought it was interesting because they're really trying.
[03:11:49.495 --> 03:11:51.757]  They're really going into overtime right now.
[03:11:52.702 --> 03:12:05.185]  Outside of app stores and I think that's obvious, you know, that's predictable RNC's live-streaming partner for the GOP debate is a haven for disinformation and Extremism.
[03:12:05.485 --> 03:12:05.705]  Okay.
[03:12:05.725 --> 03:12:14.267]  This is an article by the AP and they've been going after rumble hard Really hard, especially with the Russell Brand stuff You're seeing all these articles now.
[03:12:14.367 --> 03:12:16.948]  It's it's it's the same sequence that I just told you guys.
[03:12:16.968 --> 03:12:18.933]   I They'll try to laugh at you.
[03:12:18.973 --> 03:12:19.874]  They'll discredit you.
[03:12:20.334 --> 03:12:22.375]  At some point, they're going to try and get Rumble to join.
[03:12:22.395 --> 03:12:25.476]  And if they reject, Rumble's going to get hit hard.
[03:12:25.856 --> 03:12:26.936]  And I love Rumble.
[03:12:27.056 --> 03:12:27.576]  I love Rumble.
[03:12:28.337 --> 03:12:28.637]  All right?
[03:12:29.377 --> 03:12:30.858]  What I'm saying is that's the sequence.
[03:12:31.118 --> 03:12:32.778]  And right now, Rumble's standing their ground.
[03:12:32.798 --> 03:12:34.159]  The CEO's standing their ground.
[03:12:34.179 --> 03:12:34.979]  He's standing his ground.
[03:12:35.865 --> 03:12:49.090]  Standing for free speech, not capitulating, many statements have gone out saying we stand for free speech, we stand for the ideas of diverse thought and not all like, you know, gay and woke, like actual, like, you know, different voices and different types of content.
[03:12:49.530 --> 03:12:51.170]  There's all kinds of content on Rumble.
[03:12:52.091 --> 03:12:57.873]  But in this article, what they're arguing is that the debate is hosted on an extremist platform.
[03:12:58.593 --> 03:12:59.733]  Okay, so pay attention to this.
[03:12:59.954 --> 03:13:02.303]   This isn't even about Your show.
[03:13:02.823 --> 03:13:04.825]  This isn't even about your content any longer.
[03:13:05.245 --> 03:13:18.995]  Because in this article, if you actually take a look and you break it down, they argue that the debate is being hosted on an extremist platform that might be a gateway to extremism and other extremist content creators.
[03:13:19.196 --> 03:13:21.477]  So they didn't even take issue with the debate itself.
[03:13:21.718 --> 03:13:23.299]  They just took issue with it's on Rumble.
[03:13:23.699 --> 03:13:27.402]  So you can't, dude listen, you can't even have a show about kitties, dude.
[03:13:28.124 --> 03:13:29.065]  On Rumble these days.
[03:13:29.205 --> 03:13:31.826]  You can't even have a show about butterflies.
[03:13:32.226 --> 03:13:39.290]  You could be like a 12-year-old girl hosting a show about how much you love butterflies on Rumble.
[03:13:40.150 --> 03:13:51.336]  And you know, you can't have that because it's on an extremist platform and you're gonna be a gateway to a bunch of extremists like Drew Hernandez and Alex Jones and Owen Schroer, Elijah Schaefer, Nick Fuentes, you name it!
[03:13:51.696 --> 03:13:52.937]  You name it, Steven Crowder!
[03:13:53.397 --> 03:13:55.178]  You're gonna get radicalized!
[03:13:56.149 --> 03:13:58.890]  Because you got a show about butterflies on Rumble.
[03:13:58.910 --> 03:14:00.450]  Isn't that crazy?
[03:14:00.631 --> 03:14:08.293]  Like, you can't even have a non-political show on a platform anymore that they consider right-wing extremism.
[03:14:08.313 --> 03:14:09.854]  I mean, the same thing with Bandot Video.
[03:14:10.714 --> 03:14:13.915]  If I start a show tomorrow, you know, about... I don't know.
[03:14:15.140 --> 03:14:18.182]  You know, cars or rims or, you know what I'm saying?
[03:14:18.202 --> 03:14:20.764]  Like just some inanimate object or a hobby of mine.
[03:14:20.784 --> 03:14:28.429]  If I just started streaming video games on Band.Video, Media Matters would go after the video game developers.
[03:14:28.609 --> 03:14:29.330]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:14:29.530 --> 03:14:31.391]  But you're not allowed to affiliate.
[03:14:31.592 --> 03:14:34.694]  So you go build your own platform, you can't affiliate with it.
[03:14:34.854 --> 03:14:36.535]  Because if you do, you get banned.
[03:14:36.835 --> 03:14:39.237]  And then you can't even host a non-political show.
[03:14:40.231 --> 03:14:46.813]  On that platform, without getting considered a right-wing domestic terrorist or disinformation Russian agent.
[03:14:48.453 --> 03:14:53.094]  You see, this is, you and I understand this, but the normies need to see that this is how, this is where this goes.
[03:14:54.154 --> 03:14:57.395]  Because if you're just like a creator, like, hey, I want to go on Rumble, you know, I'm not political.
[03:14:57.915 --> 03:14:59.116]  There's, there's gamers on there.
[03:14:59.136 --> 03:15:00.556]  There's all kinds of different stuff on there.
[03:15:00.576 --> 03:15:01.456]  I'm going to go, why not?
[03:15:01.556 --> 03:15:02.556]  I can monetize over there.
[03:15:03.397 --> 03:15:04.237]  Expand my business.
[03:15:04.617 --> 03:15:04.977]  Why not?
[03:15:05.497 --> 03:15:08.978]  A lot of, a lot of young creators are thinking this way, but now you can't go do that.
[03:15:09.835 --> 03:15:10.876]  Because it's a haven.
[03:15:10.896 --> 03:15:14.017]  And they're also going after X, simultaneously.
[03:15:14.037 --> 03:15:16.859]  Here's an article from the BBC.
[03:15:16.879 --> 03:15:17.680]  They're going hard, guys.
[03:15:18.080 --> 03:15:34.109]  Disinformation most active on X, formerly known as Twitter, the EU says, X, formerly Twitter, has the biggest proportion of disinformation of six big social networks a European Commission study has suggested.
[03:15:35.299 --> 03:15:48.023]  And the EU's Value and Transparency Commissioner, this is what she said in response to X being the top social media app, now being the biggest, the biggest portal for disinformation and misinformation.
[03:15:48.063 --> 03:15:48.783]  This is what she said.
[03:15:49.043 --> 03:15:49.523]  Here's a quote.
[03:15:49.804 --> 03:15:56.526]  She said, my message for X is you have to comply with the hard law.
[03:15:56.546 --> 03:15:58.006]  This is what she said.
[03:15:58.026 --> 03:15:59.026]  This is a direct quote.
[03:15:59.287 --> 03:16:02.027]  You have to comply with the hard law.
[03:16:02.388 --> 03:16:03.628]  We'll be watching you.
[03:16:04.608 --> 03:16:06.149]  We'll be watching what you're doing!
[03:16:06.169 --> 03:16:07.571]  End quote.
[03:16:07.591 --> 03:16:08.211]  That's what she said.
[03:16:08.612 --> 03:16:10.373]  And obviously that's a threat to Elon Musk.
[03:16:11.254 --> 03:16:14.337]  So will Elon Musk stand the test of time?
[03:16:15.137 --> 03:16:18.640]  Will Elon Musk stand against, will he continue to stand his ground?
[03:16:18.660 --> 03:16:27.348]  We're seeing some good developments with, you know, getting rid of the election interference team because they're interfering with the election.
[03:16:28.587 --> 03:16:31.169]  But the New World Order is threatening and they are demanding.
[03:16:31.209 --> 03:16:34.132]  They are demanding you comply with the hard law.
[03:16:34.532 --> 03:16:35.173]  What law is that?
[03:16:35.213 --> 03:16:36.734]  The First Amendment of the United States?
[03:16:36.774 --> 03:16:37.254]  No, it's not.
[03:16:37.274 --> 03:16:41.138]  They're talking about whatever they institute and whatever they say goes.
[03:16:41.438 --> 03:16:43.180]  Whatever they say is disinformation.
[03:16:43.380 --> 03:16:45.061]  Whatever they say is misinformation.
[03:16:45.261 --> 03:16:50.566]  Whatever they say is gonna get you killed because you hurt someone's feelings and you spoke out against the regime.
[03:16:50.806 --> 03:16:52.848]  That's what she means, in my opinion.
[03:16:54.198 --> 03:16:55.299]  Thank you guys for tuning in today.
