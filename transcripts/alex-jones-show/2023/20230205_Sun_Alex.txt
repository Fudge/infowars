[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]  InfoWars.
[00:00:15.454 --> 00:00:17.454]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:29.774]   Ladies and gentlemen, there are a lot of people out there saying this Chinese
[00:00:29.774 --> 00:00:35.933]   weapons platform, that's what it is, is no big deal.
[00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:39.040]  And that it's being hyped up for no reason.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.200]  No.
[00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:51.115]  The fact that there was little or no concern about it, the fact that this has been going on for a long time, especially since Biden got in two plus years ago, is a really serious issue.
[00:00:51.135 --> 00:01:01.684]  So I decided today to dig through just some of the current news and reflect back and then forward into the future of what's really going on.
[00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:04.067]  But here's what's going on.
[00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:06.128]  The bottom line, as they say.
[00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:10.750]  China is testing.
[00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.091]  China is manipulating.
[00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:15.973]  China is seeing how far they can go with these probes.
[00:01:16.553 --> 00:01:21.775]  And when you put it together with their Confucian societies and six billion dollars a year in the U.S.
[00:01:21.835 --> 00:01:26.157]  universities to control academia and biopoliticians, I'll explain how coming up.
[00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:33.340]  And you look at their acquisition of the media and the fact that they own four of the six big production houses in Hollywood.
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:45.465]  And they're heavily allied with Hollywood and the big central banks to carry out the destruction of America, but then they outlaw all that propaganda that they finance against us in their own country.
[00:01:47.826 --> 00:01:49.426]  Now, none of this stuff should be outlawed.
[00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:54.449]  It's just, we shouldn't let our children watch it, and we shouldn't give support to it, and we should recognize what it is.
[00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.050]  Weaponized brainwashing.
[00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.379]   And there's a report here out of the Brookings Institute That makes that point of all places.
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:13.927]  That this entire system we see is being foisted by a handful of corporations and the Chinese Communist.
[00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.030]  And Russia is rejecting it.
[00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:27.480]  And I don't think that means that Russia is the perfect good guy and is wearing a white hat more like a gray hat, but the people that run our country are out to get us.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:58.741]   They're at war with us on every front and you already know that, but as soon as we can get the bureaucrats And the woke leftists to just pull back and understand that they've been Stockholm Syndrome and that they're helping their own abusers and destroyers and they're pretending like they're part of some liberal revolution to create a utopia as soon as they realize that this liberal utopia is meant to bring in total autocratic tyranny and then they're going to have a backlash and ban the entire leftist system
[00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:02.873]  That they've injected into us to only paralyze us.
[00:03:03.213 --> 00:03:07.716]  In the next phase of the New World Order program, ladies and gentlemen, it's going to be eugenics all the way.
[00:03:09.358 --> 00:03:23.628]  But they intend on making the world so hellish, in the build-up to 2030, that everybody will just wink-wink when they release the race-specific bioweapons, starting with Africa, that are going to wipe that continent absolutely out.
[00:03:26.235 --> 00:03:37.481]  And you'll be under such invasion from the refugees of the economic warfare in Africa that you will quietly, while you're playing cards with your buddies, say, well, it had to be done.
[00:03:39.002 --> 00:03:43.604]  And when you go along with that metaphysically, spiritually, culturally, the devil's got your soul.
[00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:50.968]  So I don't like the big giant African hordes being brainwashed against us and the left programming brown people to hate white people.
[00:03:51.028 --> 00:03:52.689]  It's all part of a plan, folks.
[00:03:54.036 --> 00:04:01.700]  It's all part of a very sophisticated plan, and I don't just study history, I don't just study the New World Order, I have the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:14.226]  It doesn't mean I'm a perfect vessel, far from it, but I do have deep connection to God, and God tells me that if I take part in wiping out the brown people, the black people, that I will be cut off from God.
[00:04:14.746 --> 00:04:16.287]  We're supposed to lift each other up.
[00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:30.411]  Now that doesn't mean when a gang of racist, foaming at the mouth black people come to rape, rob or kill you, which is just out of control right now, that you don't defend yourself and kill every person you need to protect your family if they're attacking you.
[00:04:31.653 --> 00:04:37.755]  That said, though, just because they're brainwashed, some of them, and are being part of that, doesn't mean we have to fall into the brainwashing either.
[00:04:37.955 --> 00:04:46.318]  And they tell you everything they're doing in the movie The Kingsman, where they send out the program through the cell phones and cell phone towers to make everybody start killing each other.
[00:04:46.838 --> 00:04:48.739]  That's what Klaus Schwab talks about, the angry world.
[00:04:48.799 --> 00:04:49.799]  This is part of a plan.
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.701]  And so the black people that have succumbed to this have succumbed to it through mind control.
[00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:56.822]  Doesn't make it any less dangerous.
[00:04:56.641 --> 00:05:06.480]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:06.458 --> 00:05:07.619]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:09.841]  I'll be here the next two plus hours.
[00:05:09.901 --> 00:05:12.303]  We have some very special information.
[00:05:12.323 --> 00:05:14.205]  We're going to be airing in the third and fourth hour.
[00:05:14.225 --> 00:05:16.226]  I'll announce that when it comes time for it.
[00:05:17.227 --> 00:05:17.947]  Let me do this.
[00:05:18.868 --> 00:05:24.453]  And I always attempt this at the start of the show, or almost always, unless there's some huge breaking thing right when we start the broadcast.
[00:05:26.394 --> 00:05:30.918]  I try to mention the different stacks so that I'm not as guilty when I don't get to them all.
[00:05:32.145 --> 00:05:55.525]  But more and more, I've realized that if I'm going to change anything about this show, that can improve it, make it more edifying, more informative, to really empower our species and all life on this planet and beyond, that I need to cover every damn bit of it.
[00:05:56.966 --> 00:06:01.127]   Now that's hard to do when we've got 14 minutes, ads an hour.
[00:06:01.187 --> 00:06:02.427]  That's a standard talk radio clock.
[00:06:04.868 --> 00:06:11.952]  And that's why I've started doing more and more freeform podcast style like I did two plus hours yesterday.
[00:06:11.972 --> 00:06:16.194]  That was, I think it had two minutes of ads in two hours, two plus hours.
[00:06:17.055 --> 00:06:20.296]  So that's what we're doing because the information comes first.
[00:06:20.776 --> 00:06:22.958]  We're still on a lot of talk radio stations, actually more than ever.
[00:06:23.378 --> 00:06:26.840]  That's why they couldn't deplatform us when they kicked us off most of the internet four years ago.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.281]  So I'll continue the info wars.
[00:06:30.848 --> 00:06:33.210]  Four hour show every day and we'll keep the other shows as well.
[00:06:35.431 --> 00:06:45.659]  And they're vital, but you've got my commitment to do at least three commercial light or commercial free podcasts a week because I've got to get to all this.
[00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:47.280]  Now there's also a paradox.
[00:06:47.721 --> 00:07:00.600]   I've got in front of me probably 150 articles and more than 20 video clips and they're all incredibly
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.560]  important.
[00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:06.074]  We could talk about one of these clips for the full show, but we don't have that luxury.
[00:07:06.115 --> 00:07:22.421]  So I'm going to judiciously, as I can, tell you what's coming up, and then I'm going to dedicate myself tonight to not getting emotional and not pontificating, which I know is entertaining at some points, and it's totally natural.
[00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:23.021]  It's what I do.
[00:07:23.922 --> 00:07:26.243]  But I'm going to try to not comment too much on these.
[00:07:26.323 --> 00:07:29.484]  Just read the news for you so you can see what's going on.
[00:07:33.004 --> 00:07:42.148]  But we have the announcement globally of the next phase of the censorship and criminal punishment of people that don't agree with the New World Order.
[00:07:42.168 --> 00:07:45.390]  I have a big horrifying stack on that.
[00:07:46.531 --> 00:07:50.512]  Just anything bad you can imagine, they're doing it, they're rolling it out.
[00:07:51.273 --> 00:07:54.715]  Every time you think it couldn't be possible, it happens.
[00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:57.536]  And I told you this years ago, I've tracked where they're going.
[00:07:58.735 --> 00:08:07.619]  Where, oh, a man can identify as a woman and vice versa, and then they can identify as a dog, a cat, and they put litter boxes out in the elementary school for the kids to potty litter boxes.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:16.022]  Well, now they're allowing pedophiles and rapists to identify as children, and they're now saying they should house them with children.
[00:08:16.703 --> 00:08:18.023]  And you're like, well, that's completely insane.
[00:08:18.303 --> 00:08:24.826]  Well, so is putting a 260-pound convicted rapist in prison with women.
[00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:28.339]  But it's what they do.
[00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:31.060]  It's the murder of logic, and it's all part of the PSYOP.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.081]  So we have that stack.
[00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:38.383]  We have an incredible World War III stack, and announcements by Putin.
[00:08:42.845 --> 00:08:46.967]  We have the Democratic Party running around, stealing money, publicly, and committing crimes.
[00:08:47.747 --> 00:08:49.728]  And they've got a get-out-of-jail-free card.
[00:08:50.428 --> 00:08:54.530]  Hell, they've got never-go-to-jail card.
[00:08:56.874 --> 00:08:57.654]  And I'm going to go over that.
[00:08:57.674 --> 00:09:01.376]  And I'm going to tie it into the Chinese spy balloon.
[00:09:03.998 --> 00:09:08.680]  And I'm going to tie it in to the good news that people are waking up to that.
[00:09:10.641 --> 00:09:13.263]  And why that is such a healthy, good thing.
[00:09:16.004 --> 00:09:17.845]  And then I've got a big stack of news here.
[00:09:17.865 --> 00:09:24.583]   I mean, if I wanted to have just high ratings and I'd be covering this stuff all day.
[00:09:24.763 --> 00:09:28.287]  And it's important to cover, but if it bleeds, it leads, they always said.
[00:09:29.128 --> 00:09:30.449]  I tend to not cover this much.
[00:09:33.132 --> 00:09:36.555]  Because you already know this is going on.
[00:09:36.595 --> 00:09:38.156]  You're experiencing the crime wave.
[00:09:38.677 --> 00:09:40.759]  But this is spectacular.
[00:09:42.881 --> 00:09:43.982]  Spectacularly bad.
[00:09:45.303 --> 00:09:46.845]  The stuff we've got on the crime front.
[00:09:49.178 --> 00:09:50.359]  More than a dozen U.S.
[00:09:50.419 --> 00:10:00.709]  cities are per capita more dangerous to be in than to have been in Baghdad during the second U.S.
[00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:01.189]  invasion.
[00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.231]  They've got big studies out.
[00:10:03.852 --> 00:10:08.556]  Study reveals Chicago riskier for young men than what U.S.
[00:10:08.596 --> 00:10:11.219]  troops faced in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:10:14.534 --> 00:10:15.395]  It's only getting worse.
[00:10:16.235 --> 00:10:18.196]  Now, why is the system doing that?
[00:10:18.236 --> 00:10:20.518]  Well, because they're trying to collapse the country.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:29.183]  And you have to ask, why is the public then voting for the same Democrats that set this up?
[00:10:29.483 --> 00:10:30.704]  The answer is election fraud.
[00:10:30.764 --> 00:10:35.287]  So you got to ask the question, where is this all going?
[00:10:35.347 --> 00:10:36.728]  So that's a stack we've got.
[00:10:38.989 --> 00:10:47.084]   Obviously, we've got the Inside scoop on what's really going on with this Chinese weapons platform drill.
[00:10:47.104 --> 00:10:50.686]  I don't know if it was loaded with weapons, but it's certainly a weapon platform.
[00:10:51.626 --> 00:10:56.009]  It's about 10 times bigger than the biggest global weather balloons.
[00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:03.313]  And it's the size of several football fields if you cut it up in pieces and let it out in squares.
[00:11:04.012 --> 00:11:10.811]   Just the communications and surveillance package on it was as long as three school buses.
[00:11:10.811 --> 00:11:20.972]   And China has bragged that they are at war with the United States in the last six, seven years.
[00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:27.752]   And that one of their main weapons is high altitude balloons to deliver EMP weapons.
[00:11:27.752 --> 00:11:37.752]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:37.939]  And again, that's because EMPs bounce off of the magnetic field of the Earth.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.540]  They're detonated in space.
[00:11:40.261 --> 00:11:48.155]   They don't have to make it to the magnetic field If they're detonated at a high altitude.
[00:11:49.416 --> 00:11:50.596]  And that is their weapon of choice.
[00:11:50.636 --> 00:11:55.117]  And I've got a whole stack from their news translated to English bragging about it.
[00:11:56.137 --> 00:11:57.818]  And very little of our media is even pointing that out.
[00:11:57.838 --> 00:12:00.118]  They're calling it a surveillance platform.
[00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:05.339]  Well, I guess you could call a scope on a rifle a surveillance device, yes.
[00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:13.301]  But what it is, is a test run for a delivery system to knock out above ground power.
[00:12:15.472 --> 00:12:28.743]  And if you think an ice storm or a blizzard knocks your power out for a couple weeks a month, you ain't seen nothing till you've seen a nuclear-powered EMP go off.
[00:12:29.423 --> 00:12:40.352]  One, it's estimated, detonated in the center of the country at 60,000, 70,000 feet, would knock out massive electronics all over the country.
[00:12:40.972 --> 00:12:43.835]  Dozens of them would basically put us into the Stone Age.
[00:12:45.416 --> 00:12:47.117]  Oh, and who wants this in the Stone Age?
[00:12:47.477 --> 00:12:48.537]  Cutting off the pipelines.
[00:12:48.637 --> 00:12:49.538]  Cutting off the fuel.
[00:12:50.618 --> 00:12:52.059]  Cutting off the oil drilling.
[00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:54.420]  Banning all the appliances that actually work.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:55.780]  The globalists.
[00:12:56.761 --> 00:12:57.641]  Cutting off the police.
[00:12:58.161 --> 00:12:58.982]  Cutting off the energy.
[00:12:59.322 --> 00:13:00.122]  Dissolving the border.
[00:13:01.603 --> 00:13:02.723]  Releasing deadly viruses.
[00:13:03.503 --> 00:13:05.724]  Rolling out poison shots against the Western world.
[00:13:06.865 --> 00:13:09.686]  The globalists are getting full control of the Western world.
[00:13:12.318 --> 00:13:13.899]  Before they wipe out the rest of the planet.
[00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:18.822]  They're just locking down the house before they release the race-specific bioweapons.
[00:13:18.842 --> 00:13:20.564]  And I've seen a lot of articles like this one.
[00:13:20.584 --> 00:13:23.466]  We're going to be talking about this stat as well today.
[00:13:24.927 --> 00:13:26.848]  The elites of Deimos don't run the world.
[00:13:26.888 --> 00:13:28.789]  They barely understand it anymore.
[00:13:30.651 --> 00:13:33.192]  That statement is absolutely false.
[00:13:34.593 --> 00:13:39.837]  And so now they can't deny there's a group that wants world government that represents the most powerful corporations, government leaders on earth.
[00:13:40.117 --> 00:13:40.998]  But they're idiots.
[00:13:41.994 --> 00:13:42.714]  And they're jokes.
[00:13:42.794 --> 00:13:52.137]  Now, they are jokes because they think they're God, and they don't understand long-term history, and they will lose, but they are the spokespersons.
[00:13:52.417 --> 00:13:55.358]  Klaus Schwab is the mouth of the New World Order.
[00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:57.618]  He's the puppet.
[00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:02.820]  But he represents what they want and what they're doing.
[00:14:05.114 --> 00:14:09.917]  That it's the complete and total sabotage of the United States and Western Europe and Australia, New Zealand, Canada.
[00:14:10.538 --> 00:14:23.167]  I mean, what do you think BlackRock, investing the majority of your pension funds, in quote, green energy that they know is a boondoggle and designed to fail, will do to your portfolio?
[00:14:23.547 --> 00:14:24.307]  Got articles on that.
[00:14:24.548 --> 00:14:54.508]   the way, BlackRock does invest in that in China. I've always found blimps, balloons,
[00:14:54.508 --> 00:14:59.907]  dirigibles to be fascinating.
[00:14:59.908 --> 00:15:03.829]  Since I was a little kid, my dad, at least once a year, would take me up in a hot air balloon in Dallas.
[00:15:04.709 --> 00:15:05.169]  I loved it.
[00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:06.970]  So I've made somewhat of a study of it.
[00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:14.552]  You know, we've got people from several miles up in space, space jumping, all for an advertisement for Red Bull.
[00:15:16.072 --> 00:15:17.393]  Humans like to explore.
[00:15:17.613 --> 00:15:19.854]  We like to do amazing things.
[00:15:20.595 --> 00:15:28.839]  So at the start of the next hour, I'll tell you my view on what's really going on with the Chinese weapons platform.
[00:15:32.021 --> 00:15:33.722]  And we'll be breaking all that down.
[00:15:33.922 --> 00:15:39.545]  But let's set the table first here with what I mentioned last segment.
[00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:42.867]  It's an article in the Washington Times.
[00:15:43.147 --> 00:15:44.228]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:15:46.713 --> 00:15:47.053]  Alert!
[00:15:47.213 --> 00:15:54.037]  NSA courting thousands of woke, laid-off, big tech workers for intelligence operations.
[00:15:55.057 --> 00:16:13.566]  So the tens of thousands of censors that have been there spying on your private messages and reading your emails and blocking you on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google, and everywhere else, they are now being scooped up and hired by the National Security Agency.
[00:16:16.172 --> 00:16:25.538]  Who is already heavily involved with the CIA and Justice Department, censoring the open borders, the Afghan withdrawal, the lockdowns, the attempted forced shots.
[00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:29.780]  This is a government operation.
[00:16:30.661 --> 00:16:31.742]  And that's why this is important.
[00:16:31.762 --> 00:16:41.448]  This isn't something of blue and green and purple and pink haired liberals running around with dirty sandals on.
[00:16:42.528 --> 00:16:43.389]  This isn't hippies.
[00:16:45.575 --> 00:17:00.600]  Those are just the Stockholm Syndrome minions who believe they're holy ones and are carrying out this jihad against the family and against men and women and children, you know, for the greater good.
[00:17:01.621 --> 00:17:13.565]  There's a big article on that and you've got the announcements by the EU and the UN that we're already controlling censorship and now we're going to censor even more and we're working with intelligence agencies in the West to bring this system in.
[00:17:15.649 --> 00:17:29.675]  That then leads to this article, UK's Nudge Unit recommends various online psychological manipulations when people shop and travel to push a net zero society, which will kill at least 4 billion people from starvation in the next decade.
[00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:32.896]  That's another big article on InfoWars.com.
[00:17:33.956 --> 00:17:34.517]  Here's another one.
[00:17:34.917 --> 00:17:43.937]   Chilling World Economic Forum showcases technology that would allow the government to Punish your thoughts and big business to spy on your brains.
[00:17:44.177 --> 00:17:46.418]  And there's a video where they brag about it.
[00:17:46.458 --> 00:17:53.601]  So the things they're saying are the most horrible, draconian, sci-fi, dystopic garbage.
[00:17:54.561 --> 00:17:55.261]  It's all real.
[00:17:56.482 --> 00:18:03.844]  And then the so-called right-wing gatekeepers tell you, oh, they're not really that powerful.
[00:18:04.104 --> 00:18:05.485]  Oh, it's not really happening.
[00:18:07.574 --> 00:18:12.296]  And they pacify you when they're building a digital prison that will then carry out the kill grid.
[00:18:13.536 --> 00:18:14.076]  Here's another one.
[00:18:14.096 --> 00:18:21.378]  Toxic masculinity fear media portrayal as fools contributing to men leaving the workforce.
[00:18:21.739 --> 00:18:35.163]  Fox News on how the media targets the family and men and men being masculine and men working and they attack that image and say it's bad so men don't feel like they're part of society anymore, they don't have any leadership, so they give up and then they're unhappy.
[00:18:35.783 --> 00:18:38.184]  And then the women that have the jobs are even more unhappy.
[00:18:38.504 --> 00:18:45.826]  They're attacking, not just our reproductive systems, but our very systems of how we are designed to operate.
[00:18:46.326 --> 00:18:48.047]  Men feel good when they work hard.
[00:18:48.447 --> 00:18:49.987]  Men feel good when they're honorable.
[00:18:50.267 --> 00:18:51.928]  Men feel good when they help other people.
[00:18:52.268 --> 00:18:56.069]  Men feel good when they expend their lives for their wives and children.
[00:18:56.569 --> 00:18:58.030]  And women feel good when they see that.
[00:18:58.810 --> 00:18:59.690]  Everybody knows that.
[00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.371]  So why do they take that away from us?
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.081]  Because they want us atomized and easily controllable.
[00:19:06.301 --> 00:19:07.222]  Look at some of these other headlines.
[00:19:07.302 --> 00:19:07.822]  Leningradian.
[00:19:08.842 --> 00:19:13.565]  Thousand-year-old remains in Finland may be non-binary Iron Age leader.
[00:19:14.465 --> 00:19:15.786]  Yes, non-binary.
[00:19:18.547 --> 00:19:27.731]  And then they take the fact that many young girls before they hit puberty have strong leadership genetics and what you would call male inclinations.
[00:19:28.956 --> 00:19:30.937]  And then as soon as they hit puberty, they become very feminine.
[00:19:31.237 --> 00:19:40.779]  They're trying to lock them into the male stereotype before they transition into being a full female.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.440]  Because they're a child.
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.561]  They're not supposed to be sexually active.
[00:19:44.941 --> 00:19:46.661]  They're in a different template at that point.
[00:19:46.901 --> 00:19:55.964]  But the hormones activate the synapses and the race memory and the instincts and the olfactory nerve and all of it.
[00:19:56.897 --> 00:19:58.400]  And you grow into a man.
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.003]  You grow into a woman.
[00:20:00.704 --> 00:20:09.240]  Instead, they arrest development, confuse the children, and tell them now there's something else that's been sterilized, making sterilization fashionable.
[00:20:11.787 --> 00:20:18.270]  I saw this meme in 1960 to 1985, the last real great generation before all you wet wipes were born.
[00:20:18.771 --> 00:20:25.534]  Well, we shouldn't make fun of the new generations being so domesticated and so dumbed down and compare earlier ones to being superior.
[00:20:25.614 --> 00:20:28.516]  No, we let the young people down.
[00:20:30.997 --> 00:20:33.198]  But yeah, that looks like my dad giving me a beer.
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.681]  I wanted to show this video.
[00:20:39.501 --> 00:20:40.822]  This is giraffe spar.
[00:20:41.963 --> 00:20:45.305]  They show a huge level of mutual respect and fair play.
[00:20:46.066 --> 00:20:50.208]  Like boxers grouped by weight, they duel with similar sized opponents.
[00:20:51.089 --> 00:20:56.772]  The direction of swing preferences are also taken into account, so neither has an unfair advantage.
[00:20:57.512 --> 00:20:59.512]  Go ahead and roll it with audio.
[00:20:59.512 --> 00:21:12.393]  Now again, people say get rid of sports.
[00:21:12.432 --> 00:21:13.833]  They say, get rid of competition.
[00:21:14.213 --> 00:21:14.914]  It can hurt people.
[00:21:14.974 --> 00:21:17.155]  No, that's what we're designed to do.
[00:21:17.195 --> 00:21:19.076]  And you take that away from us, you take away who we are.
[00:21:19.396 --> 00:21:22.799]  That's how we increase the genetic strength, is these trials.
[00:21:23.439 --> 00:21:24.980]  And it's in all creatures on this planet.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.261]  Those that don't do it, die.
[00:21:29.323 --> 00:21:34.306]  Now, here is a very important clip before I get into the communist Chinese spy news.
[00:21:36.787 --> 00:21:38.809]  And how this all ties together when we come back.
[00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:50.898]  And it's Victor Davis Hanson, historian, best-selling author, and of course, works at some of the most powerful think tanks in America.
[00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:56.021]  And he's explaining something that's hidden in plain view, like an elephant in the living room.
[00:21:57.262 --> 00:21:59.764]  The establishment is behind the woke revolution.
[00:22:00.924 --> 00:22:08.389]  Now, I know our listeners are like, and the sky is blue, and bananas are yellow, and fish swim in the sea.
[00:22:11.004 --> 00:22:28.714]  Well, the general public doesn't know this and they don't think about how they're being propagandized and manipulated and how all this vile garbage being spewed at us is a weapon system and is designed and unified to hurt us and make us be alone and depressed.
[00:22:29.214 --> 00:22:37.519]  So we will then be euthanized and agreed upon date that we agreed to in the social credit score structure.
[00:22:41.633 --> 00:22:42.374]  That is the plan.
[00:22:43.935 --> 00:22:44.976]  That's always been the plan.
[00:22:46.377 --> 00:22:57.325]  And if people can't recognize they're under attack, and then order their lives to stop the attack, you're not just gonna die, but you're not fulfilled.
[00:22:57.405 --> 00:22:59.527]  It's not work to fight tyranny.
[00:23:00.928 --> 00:23:02.489]  It's not work to be honorable.
[00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:04.110]  It's your destiny.
[00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.792]  And it's what your cells want you to do.
[00:23:07.533 --> 00:23:08.093]  We'll be right back.
[00:23:08.113 --> 00:23:08.414]  Stay with us.
[00:23:11.912 --> 00:23:23.975]  So we've talked about the Great Awakening that is undoubtedly happening and intensifying and how that frightens and also energizes our enemies who sold their soul to the devil, to the dark side.
[00:23:26.095 --> 00:23:27.336]  So the battle is now joined.
[00:23:27.816 --> 00:23:28.776]  We're pressing the attack.
[00:23:28.816 --> 00:23:29.776]  They're pressing the attack.
[00:23:29.796 --> 00:23:31.137]  They're not going to give up.
[00:23:31.237 --> 00:23:31.977]  We can't give up.
[00:23:33.457 --> 00:23:37.638]  Because giving up is a fate worse than death to these people.
[00:23:37.658 --> 00:23:40.339]  What they're going to do to our children and countless innocents.
[00:23:41.886 --> 00:23:46.550]  But I've said a lot of obvious things here because for a listener of this show and most of you tuning in, you're already awake.
[00:23:48.571 --> 00:24:01.662]  To deny there's a new world order, to deny there's an anti-family world government, to deny these people are bad, you're like, well they're all over the news, they're all over their own documents, they're all over their own statements admitting they want to get rid of us, admitting they want to control us, admitting they want to depopulate us.
[00:24:02.082 --> 00:24:04.444]  So isn't it obvious you shouldn't take shots they want you to take?
[00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:25.295]  But they put out all these thousands of different political systems and subsystems to confuse people with all this disinformation, but then they are all arrogantly talking to each other and writing white papers and books and giving speeches to each other like we don't exist about what they're going to do to us.
[00:24:25.875 --> 00:24:31.497]  And you go back and watch stuff they said 50 years ago, they basically have done everything they promised they would do and more.
[00:24:32.257 --> 00:24:36.958]  And they argue that's the reason they should be in charge, is because they're willing to carry this out and play God.
[00:24:38.154 --> 00:24:48.242]  So I ask you, do you want to just sit here blindly, like you're in the Truman Show, and let these people slowly poison you and dumb you down and try to position you to give your soul up through free will?
[00:24:49.943 --> 00:24:56.849]  Because we are electrochemical creatures that are housed in these bodies, and the globalists know that.
[00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.351]  But if you don't know that, you're going to lose.
[00:25:01.352 --> 00:25:06.876]  First you have to know God's real, God's in charge, you're in the middle of a fantastic, beyond fantastic universe.
[00:25:07.711 --> 00:25:28.355]  And then you have to understand that the universities and the mainstream media and the big Fortune 100 corporations and all of them are unified by the private central banks with a mission and everything you see from the crime to the drugs to the disparity to the evil to the pain is their work.
[00:25:29.892 --> 00:25:36.375]  They have exacerbated and greased the skids on every horrible thing going on.
[00:25:36.955 --> 00:25:38.176]  And again, I know you know that.
[00:25:38.676 --> 00:26:16.494]   But the general public, through laziness or through distraction, just can't imagine something like this because they are not conscious, and they are not informed, and they are so Lazy, by design, that they just don't even want to comprehend something like this is going on, even though the sun is setting and it's getting dark and it's getting scary and they internally, subconsciously, spiritually, know
[00:26:19.704 --> 00:26:36.532]  That they're in trouble, and then they don't want to understand that it's the power structure hurting them, the power structure they're concerned about, the power structure that they know they should do something about, and the power structure uses that subconscious awareness to manipulate them and say, oh, it's the white supremacist.
[00:26:37.792 --> 00:26:50.671]   Oh, it's, it's, it's, it's all these bad people, it's these white people, they're, they're the ones, and in a way it's true, because the globalists are mainly white and Asian, But they've got minions and all the other groups as well.
[00:26:51.872 --> 00:27:04.978]  And so, everything they're telling you about America and the free market and choice being bad and being evil, well, it is evil because they control it and they're manipulating it.
[00:27:04.998 --> 00:27:10.500]  So your subconscious knows the truth, so they're telling you a narrative that's really true, except that they're the bad guys.
[00:27:11.921 --> 00:27:21.599]   And it really is a battle of, they're the bad guys, we're the good guys, And they have to be recognized for who they are and called out.
[00:27:22.039 --> 00:27:29.485]  And then you have to realize that anytime you support them in any way, and I know it's impossible to operate in life and not support them in some ways.
[00:27:31.547 --> 00:27:37.432]  But just becoming conscious of that and making it like a game in your mind to learn how it all works.
[00:27:38.328 --> 00:27:42.090]  It's what you're designed to do and will bring your consciousness to a higher level.
[00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:43.590]  It'll activate your brain.
[00:27:44.171 --> 00:27:53.495]  It will intensify not just your awareness and not just your mathematical and business and cultural understanding, but it will give you true wisdom.
[00:27:55.095 --> 00:27:59.597]  And true wisdom will reject them and will embrace God.
[00:28:00.658 --> 00:28:06.020]  So here's one of my favorite historians and researchers, Victor David Hanson, saying something very simple.
[00:28:07.366 --> 00:28:08.307]  Two plus two equals four.
[00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:10.688]  But is it that simple?
[00:28:11.649 --> 00:28:30.400]  Because the left acts like they're ragtag groups and they're battling the establishment, but their paychecks and their ideology and everything they stand for comes directly out of the Carnegie Endowment and the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:33.102]  They create the global policies at every level.
[00:28:34.502 --> 00:28:37.985]  They then direct the UN and the IMF and the World Bank and the U.S.
[00:28:38.025 --> 00:29:00.545]  government and the Chinese government and all of these systems to carry out this giant test they're engaged in to end the human system as we know it and to make humans who are even allowed to still exist synthetic, cybernetic, corporately owned and controlled commodities beyond slavery.
[00:29:01.752 --> 00:29:10.838]  So here he is stating very obvious simple things, but it's the most important thing that wokeism is the religion of the establishment for the masses.
[00:29:10.958 --> 00:29:13.219]  It's the opiate of the masses to destroy you.
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:14.700]  It's not their religion.
[00:29:15.001 --> 00:29:18.503]  Their religion is eugenics and life extension and becoming God.
[00:29:19.503 --> 00:29:31.171]  And anyone that pretends they're on the winning team by going along with this is a fool, including people like Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and Prince Charles, who are quarterbacking the operation.
[00:29:35.464 --> 00:29:41.710]  And represent the old money and the power structure that is beyond evil.
[00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:42.911]  Here's the clip.
[00:29:43.671 --> 00:29:47.515]  Recently written a piece called The Establishment is the Revolution.
[00:29:47.595 --> 00:29:49.777]  I thought this is a particularly brilliant piece.
[00:29:50.865 --> 00:29:53.807]  The establishment is the revolution.
[00:29:54.087 --> 00:29:54.888]  What do you mean by that?
[00:29:55.368 --> 00:30:01.753]  Well, I mean, if you look in the 60s, people were marching on the campus president's office to demand change.
[00:30:01.793 --> 00:30:05.635]  Now the campus president is the one that's suppressing free speech.
[00:30:05.915 --> 00:30:11.840]  Norman Mailer wrote a novel, Armies of the Night, that we're going to march on the Pentagon for social change, etc.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:24.926]   But the Pentagon's inaugurating, you know, everything from subsidized transgender Surgeries to hunting out supposed white rage and white supremacy in the ranks on its own, by its own volition.
[00:30:25.626 --> 00:30:39.610]  I could go on, Mark, but I guess all the institutions themselves, whether it's Disney or American Airlines or where I work, Stanford University, they're agents of revolutionary change and they have enormous wealth, power, reputations, influence.
[00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:42.571]  So, it's a top-down woke revolution.
[00:30:43.311 --> 00:30:45.272]  The establishment against us, the people.
[00:30:45.891 --> 00:30:52.274]  So the establishment, the words are almost contradictory, but it makes sense.
[00:30:52.334 --> 00:30:55.115]  The establishment is the revolution.
[00:30:55.175 --> 00:30:59.077]  In other words, these are the people who are upending our society.
[00:30:59.137 --> 00:31:04.299]  These are the people who are promoting, I'll call it anti-white racism.
[00:31:04.359 --> 00:31:06.941]  These are the people who are stereotyping minorities.
[00:31:06.981 --> 00:31:15.710]   These are the people Who have the borders open in the most outrageous immigration policies this nation has ever known.
[00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:21.052]  These are the people who reject capitalism and embrace socialism.
[00:31:21.112 --> 00:31:28.753]  These are the people who are brainwashing our children and going after the parents and going after pro-lifers.
[00:31:28.813 --> 00:31:32.054]  And they never had to raise a finger in violence, you're saying.
[00:31:32.074 --> 00:31:32.814]  They just do it.
[00:31:33.427 --> 00:31:34.167]  They just do it.
[00:31:34.668 --> 00:31:38.870]  I mean, the last four directors in succession of the FBI have one thing in common.
[00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:46.214]  They've either misled Congress, or they've lied under oath to a federal investigator, or they've claimed amnesia.
[00:31:47.334 --> 00:31:54.777]   And when you look at Lois Lerner and the IRS, Or you can look at, I mean, it reaches the level of absurdity.
[00:31:54.837 --> 00:32:01.420]  We have the Duchess of Sussex in Montecito lecturing us on white microaggressions against black people.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.041]  And we've had this tragedy in Memphis.
[00:32:04.101 --> 00:32:12.004]  It was a horrible beating where five African-American officers in rogue fashion killed an innocent African-American.
[00:32:13.524 --> 00:32:31.229]  The police chief is black, the assistant police chief is black, 60% of the force is black, nearly 70% of Memphis is black, and yet we have Van Jones, a recent recipient of a hundred million dollar Bezos Prize, lecturing America that this is proof of racism.
[00:32:32.009 --> 00:32:37.530]  So these are revolutionary ideas that come from the people who are very, very wealthy.
[00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:40.131]  All right, we'll be right back and I'll give you the rest of the story.
[00:32:40.151 --> 00:32:40.571]  Stay with us.
[00:32:45.518 --> 00:32:48.563]  Welcome back to this live Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:48.783 --> 00:32:50.906]  Oh man, so much of the second hour coming up.
[00:32:51.287 --> 00:32:58.057]  Let's jump right back into all this interconnected, multivariate, multifaceted information.
[00:33:00.785 --> 00:33:19.094]  I want to get into the awakening to the fact that the United States has been totally infiltrated by the Communist Chinese by design, why there's a split now in the New World Order, where the fault lines are, and how we can use that against the globalists and against the chi-coms for a better human future.
[00:33:20.034 --> 00:33:23.115]  Here's another one of the articles I want to tie together with it, currently on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.536 --> 00:33:28.118]  Bill Gates says Elon Musk should focus on mass vaccination, not going to Mars.
[00:33:29.181 --> 00:33:33.654]  He goes on to criticize him and say we don't need to go to Mars because he doesn't want a pro-human future.
[00:33:34.296 --> 00:33:36.522]  He wants to focus on giving people shots!
[00:33:37.369 --> 00:33:42.614]  Well, Musk has come out against the shots and said it made him sick and it almost killed his cousin and made a bunch of his family sick.
[00:33:42.634 --> 00:33:47.899]  So, that's Bill Gates basically threatening Musk, saying that's what they're doing.
[00:33:47.919 --> 00:33:50.721]  We're going to shut your companies down if you don't get on board with us.
[00:33:51.122 --> 00:33:53.244]  Well, imagine what it's like for Elon Musk.
[00:33:54.104 --> 00:33:55.566]  Who knows people want to go to space?
[00:33:55.826 --> 00:33:56.827]  We want to empower humanity.
[00:33:56.847 --> 00:33:59.730]  And he could be a hero if he actually did that.
[00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:22.291]   And he now represents, in the globalist establishment, Whether it's for real, or he's an opportunist, or it's a mix of things, the opposition to their post-human world, he says we should have 2.1 children or more, that society collapses without children, you know, all the numbers, all the actuaries, all the research, and Bill Gates says you should focus on depopulation, you should focus on taking over people's bodies.
[00:34:24.032 --> 00:34:25.233]  So that's very, very important.
[00:34:25.273 --> 00:34:38.269]   Now, let's continue here with what's very encouraging, and then I'll get into the Buy Weapon Platform Balloon and give me the inside scoop, in my opinion, next hour.
[00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:40.811]  So here's just a few of the headlines.
[00:34:41.371 --> 00:34:43.993]  Donald Trump warns of Chinese spies everywhere in America.
[00:34:44.214 --> 00:34:44.654]  Totally true.
[00:34:45.675 --> 00:34:46.115]  Bill Maher.
[00:34:46.776 --> 00:34:49.698]  Woke revolution, very similar to Mao's cultural revolution.
[00:34:49.938 --> 00:34:52.020]  No, it's run by the same big U.S.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:52.581]  foundations.
[00:34:53.461 --> 00:34:55.483]  A little on record, but Mao's a tongue and a power.
[00:34:55.503 --> 00:34:56.504]  But why is he saying that?
[00:34:59.605 --> 00:35:01.986]  Because the globalists never took over the entire U.S.
[00:35:02.026 --> 00:35:02.566]  establishment.
[00:35:03.567 --> 00:35:05.928]  And there's a real hunger to not go under this tyranny.
[00:35:07.108 --> 00:35:10.390]  And a lot of people are having second thoughts now, which is good.
[00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:18.613]  And I know that the Elon Musk and the Bill Mahers of the world and the Joe Rogans tune into this show.
[00:35:19.333 --> 00:35:20.014]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:35:20.734 --> 00:35:36.429]   And they can sit back and think, if they have any humanity left, which they do, I believe, Okay, you've gotten rich and powerful working with the system, but when the system itself is designed to destroy the human system in the end, how's all that money going to be of any value to you when you're building a dystopia?
[00:35:37.209 --> 00:35:41.731]  You see, there's not just a desire to join evil and a lust to be on the dark side.
[00:35:42.131 --> 00:35:47.194]  And I've experienced that when I was younger and channeled dark forces, unbelievably dark forces.
[00:35:48.094 --> 00:35:48.794]  And I'll leave it at that.
[00:35:49.295 --> 00:35:54.397]  But that was God allowing me to be tested so that I would have a more advanced understanding.
[00:35:56.425 --> 00:35:57.145]  And I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:35:58.666 --> 00:36:01.427]  But I know the forces that possess them.
[00:36:02.148 --> 00:36:04.128]  I know the forces that flow through them.
[00:36:04.809 --> 00:36:05.589]  Because I felt it.
[00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:15.434]  And it is a feeling of invincibility and dominance and a right to rule.
[00:36:18.975 --> 00:36:20.396]  But only if you hurt others.
[00:36:22.657 --> 00:36:25.198]  It is an impetus to kill.
[00:36:28.396 --> 00:36:29.056]  Now continuing.
[00:36:30.657 --> 00:36:31.737]  Border Patrol Union.
[00:36:32.598 --> 00:36:36.659]  China watching our borders more closely than the Biden administration.
[00:36:37.079 --> 00:36:38.160]  What a true statement.
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.061]  And helping bring in the fentanyl and controlling the drug gangs.
[00:36:42.101 --> 00:36:42.641]  There's another one.
[00:36:42.661 --> 00:36:51.104]  Charlie Munger, the mentor of Bill Gates and of Warren Buffett.
[00:36:51.785 --> 00:36:53.505]  Constantly praising communist China.
[00:36:53.965 --> 00:37:06.585]   And in a new article he wrote, He said Communist China, calling Communist China, is the answer, and we need total surveillance and control over everyone, and we should bow down to China, and we should arrest anyone that doesn't agree with us.
[00:37:07.205 --> 00:37:09.427]  Now, I played a video six months ago where he said that.
[00:37:11.949 --> 00:37:13.010]  He's written it again.
[00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.372]  And you can go read these quotes if you want.
[00:37:16.392 --> 00:37:20.955]  They're on ZeroHedge.com and Infowars.com, but it's important.
[00:37:20.975 --> 00:37:26.199]  Charlie Munger, exemplar of centillionaire privilege.
[00:37:28.154 --> 00:37:30.496]  He says arrest anybody that's involved in cryptocurrency.
[00:37:32.138 --> 00:37:34.700]  Now let's continue to the ground level of this control.
[00:37:36.822 --> 00:37:42.767]  Secret communist Chinese police station in New York now closing following FBI raid.
[00:37:44.769 --> 00:38:03.921]   Trump got several billion dollars into the budget to go after the Confucian Institutes who alone every year Drop $6.1 billion or more into universities.
[00:38:05.222 --> 00:38:14.289]  Now, when you hear about a Beto O'Rourke or a Brian Stelter, once they know their failures, once they know that they didn't work, what do they get?
[00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:25.357]  They suddenly get a $400,000, $500,000 a year job at Stanford or at Harvard or at the Chicago Business School.
[00:38:27.213 --> 00:38:33.636]  And they get several other professorships, and they get a book deal, and a multi-million dollar advance, even though no one buys the book.
[00:38:34.416 --> 00:38:35.177]  That's the payoff.
[00:38:35.617 --> 00:38:47.042]  But the money is coming from the Carnegie Endowment, and others, but it's also coming from the Rockefeller Endowment, and then it's coming from the Confucian Institutes.
[00:38:48.583 --> 00:38:52.265]  And that's how they're controlling the media, and create that safety net for their minions.
[00:38:54.218 --> 00:39:01.881]  GOP representative Mike Gallagher, Biden dropped Trump rule that revealed $6.1 billion in Chinese donations to universities.
[00:39:03.022 --> 00:39:03.522]  Here's another one.
[00:39:04.122 --> 00:39:05.443]  South Carolina Dem.
[00:39:05.523 --> 00:39:10.505]  Claiborne sent six figures of campaign funds to relatives.
[00:39:11.705 --> 00:39:23.727]   I see Republican congressmen indicted all the time because They put a steak dinner for their employees on a credit card or took their wife with them to Hawaii.
[00:39:24.127 --> 00:39:30.551]  They get 5, 6, 7, 10 year federal prison sentences for that.
[00:39:35.254 --> 00:39:38.195]  And that's how the system works.
[00:39:39.476 --> 00:39:42.618]  And that's why it's so hard to deal with.
[00:39:44.531 --> 00:39:47.112]  But people are getting angry, and they're realizing what's going on.
[00:39:47.132 --> 00:40:02.815]  And they're understanding that, just like Israel, and I'm not against Israel itself, I don't hate Jews, but I don't like China, or the UK, or the UN, or the EU, heavily involved in our politics and our lives, and Israel.
[00:40:03.375 --> 00:40:20.989]   Israel's a city-state, basically, like the Vatican, or like the City of London within London, the Financial District, that is above the law, does what it wants, lets its citizens commit crimes and come back to it, And it's the same thing with China, but on steroids.
[00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:31.683]  China's a million and a half people, hardworking, smart people, but totally enslaved, to leverage out all competition and centralize control here in the West.
[00:40:32.605 --> 00:40:37.789]  With one-sided trade deals where they have 98% of rare earth mineral controls and the list just goes on and on.
[00:40:38.049 --> 00:40:41.511]  But now you notice they're saying we've got to get control of rare earth minerals in the West.
[00:40:41.971 --> 00:40:43.392]  We've got to have chip manufacturing.
[00:40:43.412 --> 00:40:44.413]  We've got to cut China off.
[00:40:44.693 --> 00:40:53.820]  So this whole deal to position us to fall and China would take over is failing because in the power structure what our forefathers talked about is a separation of powers.
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.702]  It's not that the Republican leaders are perfect or even good.
[00:40:57.142 --> 00:41:13.676]  But that's why you have three branches of government, and a federal and state government, and then you have the fourth, the state, the media, is because they know that different people will battle with each other for control, and out of that battle, we will stop centralization, and we can stop the man on the white horse.
[00:41:13.717 --> 00:41:15.198]  We can stop the dictatorship.
[00:41:16.932 --> 00:41:21.993]  And so, very positive, important moves as the world wakes up to this.
[00:41:22.033 --> 00:41:23.633]  We're going to go to break here in a few minutes.
[00:41:24.374 --> 00:41:33.816]  We're going to come back and I'm going to go all through the balloon and the Russian news and the war news and the economy news and where all that's going and a bunch of wokeism and just a ton of clips I haven't gotten to.
[00:41:34.236 --> 00:41:36.596]  Such an important broadcast coming up in the second hour.
[00:41:39.457 --> 00:41:40.557]  So please listen to me carefully.
[00:41:44.096 --> 00:41:46.398]  You wanted somebody to stand up and take on evil.

[00:44:07.546 --> 00:44:09.546]  Get it now.
[00:44:09.546 --> 00:44:21.346]  I'm going to get into the blimp and the latest information.
[00:44:21.346 --> 00:44:22.106]  Spy balloon.
[00:44:22.452 --> 00:44:24.536]  But first we're talking about censorship and control.
[00:44:25.057 --> 00:44:27.903]  The Democrats are openly trying to pass laws to ban free speech.
[00:44:28.264 --> 00:44:28.965]  Here's Tucker Carlson.
[00:44:30.663 --> 00:44:34.746]  So almost no one was paying attention to the early actions in the Biden administration.
[00:44:34.826 --> 00:44:38.529]  Biden gets inaugurated, and the media spend the next year talking about how great Biden is.
[00:44:38.549 --> 00:44:49.597]  So very few people noticed that just a week after the presidential inauguration in January of 2021, Biden's FBI arrested a 31-year-old man from Vermont called Douglas Mackey.
[00:44:50.276 --> 00:44:57.537]  Now according to the DOJ, in the charging documents, Mackey's crime was making fun of Hillary Clinton on the internet.
[00:44:58.457 --> 00:45:06.899]  Four years, four years before he was arrested, Mackey made an internet meme, joking it was possible to vote for Hillary Clinton by text message.
[00:45:07.459 --> 00:45:14.320]  Not a single person in America, and DOJ has not shown differently, believed that Mackey was serious or that you could vote for Hillary by text message.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.381]  He wasn't subverting democracy, he was calling Hillary voters stupid.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.281]  The DOJ knows that.
[00:45:20.321 --> 00:45:21.281]  Every person knows that.
[00:45:21.762 --> 00:45:23.323]  Jokes are not crimes.
[00:45:24.103 --> 00:45:28.506]  But the Biden administration is trying to send Douglas Mackey to prison for years.
[00:45:29.346 --> 00:45:32.849]  We've been trying for a year to speak to one of his lawyers, because this is one of the great outrages of this story.
[00:45:33.189 --> 00:45:36.531]  James Lawrence is one of Douglas Mackey's lawyers, and we're happy to have him on tonight.
[00:45:36.891 --> 00:45:38.712]  Mr. Lawrence, thank you so much for coming on.
[00:45:39.513 --> 00:45:42.255]  This is such an obvious violation of the First Amendment.
[00:45:42.275 --> 00:45:44.156]  This is so clearly totalitarian.
[00:45:44.416 --> 00:45:46.998]  How did it get to this point in the court system?
[00:45:48.712 --> 00:45:53.094]  Well, first of all, thanks, Tucker, for having me on to discuss this important case.
[00:45:53.654 --> 00:46:06.380]  And as we've argued in court filings, we believe that this prosecution represents a significant escalation of the government's regulation of speech under the banner of policing so-called disinformation.
[00:46:06.881 --> 00:46:17.366]  And, Tucker, really, you were one of the first public figures and one of the most prominent people to criticize Twitter for deplatforming people over so-called disinformation.
[00:46:18.508 --> 00:46:26.676]  But I don't think even you would have thought that someone would face a federal prosecution or potential jail time over alleged memes.
[00:46:26.736 --> 00:46:29.539]  Now, here's what's at issue.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:41.108]   The government says that this case is about voting rights, but as we've argued, The government has not alleged that a single person didn't vote as a result of the alleged memes.
[00:46:41.668 --> 00:46:59.358]  So we think that this case goes to the core of the First Amendment, and really regardless of what you think about the content at issue, everyone in this country, Tucker, left, right, center, and every political persuasion in between should be concerned about what's happening in this case.
[00:46:59.959 --> 00:47:02.100]  And so the question is, what can you do?
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:05.802]  And there are two things I'd like to let your audience know about.
[00:47:05.982 --> 00:47:12.787]  First, Douglas Mackey's Legal Defense Fund can be supported by logging on to memedefensefund.com.
[00:47:13.608 --> 00:47:18.411]  And second, and really most importantly, Tucker, we're asking your audience to pray.
[00:47:19.011 --> 00:47:19.732]  Pray for Doug.
[00:47:20.432 --> 00:47:21.573]  Pray for the defense team.
[00:47:21.873 --> 00:47:23.735]  Pray for justice to be done.
[00:47:24.542 --> 00:47:27.365]  As for Doug, I can tell you, Tucker, he has great faith in God.
[00:47:27.786 --> 00:47:33.893]  He also has faith in our system of trial by jury, which our founders gave to us in the Bill of Rights.
[00:47:34.494 --> 00:47:38.058]  I can also tell you, for me, it's a privilege to be on his defense team.
[00:47:38.658 --> 00:47:41.321]  Wait, may I say, I just want to make one thing completely clear.
[00:47:41.982 --> 00:47:43.884]  You've said it, I've said it, but I just want to restate it.
[00:47:44.505 --> 00:47:51.817]  The Biden administration has not shown, held up a single victim of this so-called crime, this joke.
[00:47:52.358 --> 00:47:54.762]  So if there's no victim, how is it a crime?
[00:47:55.203 --> 00:47:55.904]  I'm confused.
[00:47:56.827 --> 00:48:12.259]  The government's position is that merely the conspiracy and the intent to interfere with one's right to vote is enough under the statute at issue in this case.
[00:48:12.659 --> 00:48:23.765]   And of course, if the government's theory is allowed to prevail, The Pandora's Box that could be opened with respect to the chilling effect on speech, it just can't be really overstated.
[00:48:24.206 --> 00:48:37.152]  Any speech, we contend, Tucker, that could potentially land someone facing a criminal investigation and looking at potential jail time.
[00:48:37.412 --> 00:48:39.093]  We can't open this Pandora's Box.
[00:48:39.133 --> 00:48:45.196]  The defense team in this case is committed to slamming the door shut on this theory.
[00:48:45.984 --> 00:48:49.767]  Hillary Clinton should stand up right now in defense of Douglas Mackey.
[00:48:49.807 --> 00:48:50.988]  This is being done in her name.
[00:48:51.568 --> 00:48:55.691]  You don't want to live in a country where politicians can throw you in jail for criticizing them.
[00:48:56.092 --> 00:48:57.072]  That's not a free country.
[00:48:57.252 --> 00:49:00.195]  No one's covering this because, oh, Mackey's a bad guy.
[00:49:00.215 --> 00:49:01.976]  I don't, you know, I don't care.
[00:49:01.996 --> 00:49:03.918]  I don't care if he's Stalin.
[00:49:04.258 --> 00:49:05.939]  No American citizen can be treated this way.
[00:49:06.299 --> 00:49:06.720]  Period.
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:07.580]  That's right.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.362]  So anyway, I appreciate your, I really do appreciate your coming on today.
[00:49:10.382 --> 00:49:12.224]  And by the way, he doesn't sound like a bad guy, but whatever.
[00:49:12.244 --> 00:49:13.865]  It doesn't matter, in my opinion.
[00:49:16.636 --> 00:49:20.318]  We are now into our number two on this live.
[00:49:21.219 --> 00:49:24.120]  Sunday, February 5th, 2023 transmission.
[00:49:25.421 --> 00:49:26.422]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:49:28.583 --> 00:49:31.064]  All right, let's get into the balloon.
[00:49:31.084 --> 00:49:33.986]  And let's talk facts here.
[00:49:34.006 --> 00:49:38.349]  Because there's a lot of people out there.
[00:49:39.709 --> 00:49:43.972]  That just on its face don't believe anything the government says about anything.
[00:49:44.852 --> 00:49:45.553]  But here's the facts.
[00:49:46.795 --> 00:49:48.216]  It is a Chinese balloon.
[00:49:49.477 --> 00:49:57.141]  It is a gigantic balloon that was shot down, obviously, yesterday while we were live on air doing a Saturday emergency broadcast at about 2 p.m.
[00:49:58.682 --> 00:49:59.523]  Central Time or so.
[00:50:01.524 --> 00:50:14.692]  The facts are China has put a lot of money into high-altitude balloons for what you call satellite arrays, surveillance arrays, but more importantly, communication systems.
[00:50:18.683 --> 00:50:22.987]  But they've also put a lot of money in, and I have dozens of articles here from China.
[00:50:23.667 --> 00:50:24.608]  I covered them Friday.
[00:50:25.048 --> 00:50:27.451]  I covered it on Saturday.
[00:50:27.911 --> 00:50:29.012]  But I'm going to go back over some of it.
[00:50:30.373 --> 00:50:38.140]  To deliver an electromagnetic pulse weapon that's detonated and powered by an atomic or hydrogen bomb going off.
[00:50:39.481 --> 00:50:51.433]   It's estimated that a 40 megaton bomb, that's a medium-sized bomb, Would knock out large portions of the United States that was detonated around 80,000 feet in the right conditions.
[00:50:53.975 --> 00:50:55.096]  And a lot goes into that.
[00:50:56.777 --> 00:51:04.222]  But there's more radiation that goes further at night because of radiation that's already in the atmosphere from the sun.
[00:51:04.242 --> 00:51:06.643]  And so they would try to detonate these at night.
[00:51:07.504 --> 00:51:08.685]  They would have a much bigger effect.
[00:51:09.639 --> 00:51:11.980]  You've seen what solar flares do wreaking havoc with satellites.
[00:51:12.161 --> 00:51:13.882]  That's nothing compared to this.
[00:51:13.942 --> 00:51:16.603]  This is a gigantic balloon.
[00:51:17.664 --> 00:51:23.547]  And one got shot down last year off the coast of the U.S.
[00:51:23.567 --> 00:51:25.208]  military base in Kauai.
[00:51:25.329 --> 00:51:33.193]  That's where the nuclear ICBM bases are on that island, not just in Montana and Wyoming and other areas.
[00:51:33.794 --> 00:51:37.816]  They also have anti-ballistic missile defense system at a big base in Kauai.
[00:51:38.396 --> 00:51:39.097]  And they shot it down.
[00:51:40.299 --> 00:51:41.800]  There's another one in Canada right now.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.281]  There's another one in South America going north right now.
[00:51:45.562 --> 00:52:00.749]  And the fact that Biden didn't order this shot down day one, the fact that the Communist Chinese confirmed it was theirs, just shows you what the Border Patrol said covered last hour, that they're not watching the border.
[00:52:00.769 --> 00:52:02.450]  They're not watching anything except us.
[00:52:04.192 --> 00:52:12.017]  And then you have Hunter Biden with a laptop and saying he works for Chinese intelligence and all the classified documents at the house he was running for 50 grand a month from his dad.
[00:52:12.497 --> 00:52:21.963]  These are all just absolutely pieces of proof that the Bidens are Chinese communist agents.
[00:52:22.744 --> 00:52:25.806]  I don't think they purely work for China because they'll take money from anybody that will give it to them.
[00:52:25.826 --> 00:52:26.566]  They're above the law.
[00:52:27.787 --> 00:52:28.928]  But this is a big deal.
[00:52:30.369 --> 00:52:36.385]   And if we put a blimp or a balloon Over China, they would shoot it down.
[00:52:37.366 --> 00:52:48.035]  The fact is, it was only when there was mounting massive pressure, did Biden use the F-22 Raptor with a sidewinder missile to take it down.
[00:52:49.576 --> 00:53:02.889]   And it was obviously guided in by the communication systems on the blimp, on the balloon, because it hit right into that complex that was as long as three School buses hanging from the bottom of the blimp.
[00:53:03.229 --> 00:53:18.763]  I've got a bunch of newscasts out of China, I've got newscasts out of the U.S., I've got newscasts out of Russia, I've got newscasts out of NASA describing these different blimps, and I've got China showing these blimps and bragging in Chinese that they can deliver weapons over the U.S.
[00:53:19.583 --> 00:53:26.821]   So the fact that they've said they're at war with us on a weekly basis for years, The fact that this has been going on is important.
[00:53:27.322 --> 00:53:28.823]  Yes, the globalists set up China.
[00:53:28.903 --> 00:53:30.344]  Yes, they put Mao Zedong in charge.
[00:53:31.144 --> 00:53:43.453]  But by the time Xi Jinping came along, and now he's arrested his predecessor that was working with the globalists, Xi Jinping has told big tech of the New World Order, I'm in charge, and I'm not in a deal with you anymore.
[00:53:44.073 --> 00:53:53.980]  And so, just like Stalin and Hitler for the first two years of World War II had a deal, and then Hitler broke it, it's the same story again.
[00:53:55.461 --> 00:53:58.162]  China threatens resolute action as U.S.
[00:53:59.242 --> 00:54:02.624]  warned to brace for further provocations after spy balloon was shot down.
[00:54:03.844 --> 00:54:06.925]  Third Chinese spy balloon is operating near U.S.
[00:54:07.005 --> 00:54:11.387]  interests, but officials won't say where after shooting down first balloon off South Carolina coast.
[00:54:12.847 --> 00:54:18.829]  House Homeland Security Chair, I never got alerted about CCP spy balloon by Biden White House.
[00:54:19.269 --> 00:54:20.490]  That, of course, is illegal.
[00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:23.591]  We're not telling anybody anything, folks.
[00:54:24.935 --> 00:54:26.935]  They're busy raping little kids and stuff.
[00:54:27.316 --> 00:54:31.977]  Republicans call for pro-Biden's resignation amid Chinese spy balloon blunder.
[00:54:32.017 --> 00:54:35.557]  Yes, he should be impeached for that.
[00:54:35.918 --> 00:54:44.860]  But notice the establishment wants to get rid of him now to bring in somebody like Big Mike, Michelle Obama or Gavin Newsom.
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:46.580]  There's a lot of stuff going on.
[00:54:49.192 --> 00:54:56.438]  Behind the scenes here, and as soon as Biden figured out they were trying to impeach him over this, then as it left US airspace, was about to, he had it shot down.
[00:54:57.679 --> 00:55:00.761]  But the most important thing is the flashback that's on Infowars.com.
[00:55:01.362 --> 00:55:08.648]  Biden terminates Trump-era program to combat Chinese espionage and the billions a year coming in to buy off our leaders.
[00:55:10.445 --> 00:55:13.406]  In academia, in finance, in government, you name it.
[00:55:13.927 --> 00:55:18.068]  It has been open season for the Chinese to infiltrate because they were working with the globalists.
[00:55:18.408 --> 00:55:26.412]  And the globalists were using China as a base of operations to project globalist power.
[00:55:28.693 --> 00:55:29.753]  And it goes on from there.
[00:55:31.614 --> 00:55:35.715]  So some people are saying, well, you know, this is a manufactured news story.
[00:55:35.775 --> 00:55:36.936]  No, it's a real balloon.
[00:55:38.018 --> 00:55:41.499]  And it got shot down and it wasn't surveilling U.S.
[00:55:41.539 --> 00:55:42.339]  military bases.
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:44.080]  You use satellites for that.
[00:55:46.421 --> 00:56:00.005]  A balloon of this size that is able to maneuver itself with jets, not just up and down, but left and right, is the perfect package to deliver an EMP attack.
[00:56:01.581 --> 00:56:03.142]  And I mentioned this earlier, but here's the article.
[00:56:03.662 --> 00:56:04.403]  Sounds about right.
[00:56:04.483 --> 00:56:13.249]  University of Chicago taps losers Beto O'Rourke and Tim Ryan to teach politics, which the Chinese fund the university, just like Penn State with Biden.
[00:56:13.749 --> 00:56:16.471]  They put hundreds of millions into Penn State alone.
[00:56:17.231 --> 00:56:33.420]   And then, of course, Penn State lobbied Biden to remove those Trump-era controls, illustrating just how criminal These individuals are and how deep it espionage is.
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:39.641]  But the good news is the power structure is greedy and jealous of control.
[00:56:41.422 --> 00:56:56.505]  And so even though they love communist China and the one-child policies and the forced abortion and the suicide nets and the forced drugging and the lockdowns and they love all the tyranny and the big military parades and all of it, China isn't doing what they tell them.
[00:56:57.605 --> 00:56:59.766]  China isn't following orders anymore.
[00:57:01.966 --> 00:57:04.168]  And so it's that separation of powers again.
[00:57:05.289 --> 00:57:22.787]  You know you have a corrupt government, you have a corrupt system, but if there's different power structures, they will fight with each other instead of getting unified against you and I. But because I mentioned it, let me just show you some news headlines where you can learn all about EMP attacks from these.
[00:57:24.522 --> 00:57:26.483]  High-altitude balloons.
[00:57:27.704 --> 00:57:29.605]  And again, it's very simple.
[00:57:31.146 --> 00:57:36.328]  You cannot deliver an EMP strike from a satellite.
[00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:41.691]  It dissipates through the Earth's magnetic field and bounces off.
[00:57:42.792 --> 00:57:46.173]  But if you go through the magnetic field, that's where you want to detonate it.
[00:57:47.454 --> 00:57:48.294]  Here's some of the headlines.
[00:57:49.015 --> 00:57:50.756]  Is China plotting an EMP attack?
[00:57:50.896 --> 00:57:52.737]  Only if it wants World War III.
[00:57:54.468 --> 00:57:54.848]  Report.
[00:57:55.969 --> 00:57:59.250]  China was testing for EMP attack on Taiwan.
[00:58:00.551 --> 00:58:03.092]  DHS from dhs.news.gov.
[00:58:03.913 --> 00:58:06.334]  Combats potential electromagnetic pulse EMP attack.
[00:58:06.394 --> 00:58:06.654]  Really?
[00:58:06.674 --> 00:58:09.476]  You wouldn't even tell the public or Congress or anybody that was above us.
[00:58:10.256 --> 00:58:12.717]  China might have sent a spy balloon over the U.S.
[00:58:12.858 --> 00:58:15.459]  as a power play to prove it could do what it wants.
[00:58:19.147 --> 00:58:20.448]  Yes, that's what it's been doing.
[00:58:21.609 --> 00:58:23.951]  And it goes on from there that it's the perfect package.
[00:58:24.751 --> 00:58:26.393]  The platformer launched the EMP attack.
[00:58:27.093 --> 00:58:35.260]  I'm going to finish up with this and then shift gears into the rest of the story and some key clips and how they're trying to trigger a race war.
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:38.182]  On the other side, please stay with us.
[00:58:38.242 --> 00:58:39.283]  Infowars.com.
[00:58:39.703 --> 00:58:40.524]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:58:45.288 --> 00:58:52.094]   All right, now looking From the United States and China with the weapon platform balloon on a surveillance balloon.
[00:58:56.936 --> 00:58:58.536]  Let's look at what's happening in Ukraine.
[00:58:58.916 --> 00:59:00.577]  Russia has drawn up at least 400,000 to 700,000 troops.
[00:59:00.677 --> 00:59:01.177]  They say 500,000.
[00:59:01.657 --> 00:59:02.337]  Conservative numbers are 400,000.
[00:59:02.397 --> 00:59:03.918]  Some numbers are as high as 700,000.
[00:59:03.778 --> 00:59:09.457]   500,000, conservative numbers are 400,000, some numbers are as high as 700,000.
[00:59:09.457 --> 00:59:17.978]   And in Russia's genetic memory from just 75 years ago, they were hit by a multi-million man army
[00:59:17.978 --> 00:59:21.317]  out of Deutschland, Germany.
[00:59:21.317 --> 00:59:31.098]   And of the people that died in World War II, an estimated 55 million,
[00:59:33.551 --> 00:59:36.432]  42 million of those were Germans and Russians.
[00:59:37.713 --> 00:59:43.796]  The estimates vary between 20 million and 25 million Germans, and 20 and 24 million Russians.
[00:59:45.036 --> 00:59:45.837]  That's millions.
[00:59:47.301 --> 00:59:49.802]  That's how many football stadiums of 100,000 people.
[00:59:51.483 --> 01:00:04.391]  And so Putin, on one of their main World War II holidays, when every Russian lost family, he said, it's hard to believe.
[01:00:04.411 --> 01:00:05.312]  Let me just read the quotes.
[01:00:05.832 --> 01:00:07.153]  It's unbelievable, but true.
[01:00:08.073 --> 01:00:12.376]  We are once again threatened with German leopard tanks with crosses on their hull.
[01:00:13.476 --> 01:00:20.331]   And once again, Seeking to battle Russia and Ukraine with the help of Hitler's followers.
[01:00:23.613 --> 01:00:24.053]  He went on.
[01:00:27.155 --> 01:00:28.035]  And that's the reality.
[01:00:29.936 --> 01:00:31.377]  And NATO started the war over there.
[01:00:32.577 --> 01:00:33.718]  And Russia's not going to give up.
[01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:44.683]  And Putin says if there's any strikes inside Russia that hit Moscow, he's going to use tactical nuclear weapons, and then NATO uses them, and then we're all dead.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:46.621]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:00:46.941 --> 01:00:49.644]  It escalates to full war.
[01:00:50.745 --> 01:00:53.007]  And people notice I'm pretty calm.
[01:00:53.047 --> 01:00:54.208]  I'm pretty serious right now.
[01:00:54.589 --> 01:01:01.615]  It's because the threat level's gotten so insane, ladies and gentlemen, that now I've got ice water in my veins.
[01:01:04.018 --> 01:01:10.344]  And I've got to look at my children, both grown and still little, and realize we've all let this get to this point.
[01:01:12.338 --> 01:01:19.784]  We have these satanic clowns dancing to Satan's fiddle that have gotten us to this point.
[01:01:19.824 --> 01:01:21.025]  So here's Putin.
[01:01:21.766 --> 01:01:22.606]  He has subtitles.
[01:01:23.827 --> 01:01:26.209]  So we'll start and stop it, and I'll read the subtitles.
[01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:28.371]  Obviously, as most of us don't speak Russian, here it is.
[01:01:31.614 --> 01:01:33.715]  Putin invokes Stalingrad to justify war.
[01:01:33.875 --> 01:01:34.256]  Start over.
[01:01:35.797 --> 01:01:37.839]  Putin invokes Stalingrad to justify Ukraine war.
[01:01:37.859 --> 01:01:38.139]  Here it is.
[01:01:43.106 --> 01:01:44.307]  It's incredible but it's fact.
[01:01:45.949 --> 01:01:50.188]   were being threatened again by the German Leopard tanks with crosses on their armor.
[01:01:50.188 --> 01:02:04.668]  Once again they're going to war with Russia on Ukraine soil.
[01:02:04.613 --> 01:02:11.483]   With the hands of Hitler's followers, Ukrainian nationalists, we aren't sending our tanks to their borders, but we have
[01:02:11.483 --> 01:02:12.853]  things to respond with.
[01:02:12.853 --> 01:02:24.213]  It will not end with the use of armored vehicles.
[01:02:24.501 --> 01:02:25.541]  Everybody should understand it.
[01:02:26.702 --> 01:02:30.061]   Those who threaten us must have failed to understand a simple truth.
[01:02:30.061 --> 01:02:43.261]   All our people, all of us have been raised on the traditions of our people and the generation of victors.
[01:02:43.224 --> 01:03:02.103]   who have created our country with their labor, blood, and handed over to us.
[01:03:02.103 --> 01:03:08.824]   The strength of the defenders of Stalingrad is the most important moral beacon for the
[01:03:08.824 --> 01:03:11.824]  Russian Army and for all of us.
[01:03:11.865 --> 01:03:14.067]  Our soldiers and officers are faithful to this.
[01:03:15.768 --> 01:03:18.450]  So the Russians didn't like invading Ukraine, and I get it.
[01:03:20.771 --> 01:03:23.393]  And Russians don't usually start the wars, but you know how it ends.
[01:03:24.514 --> 01:03:28.156]  Now they're going to fully mobilize, ladies and gentlemen, and it's going to get really bad.
[01:03:30.054 --> 01:03:36.539]  And if they'd lose 20 plus million people in World War II, that was a third of their population or almost a third.
[01:03:39.301 --> 01:03:43.705]  What do you think your population twice that size today is going to do?
[01:03:45.806 --> 01:03:51.110]  At the end of the day, all the robots and all the drones and all the crap isn't going to win that war.
[01:03:52.511 --> 01:03:55.474]  And the Ukrainians have been hijacked and tricked into a Slavic civil war.
[01:03:57.574 --> 01:03:58.775]  Zelensky is a dictator.
[01:03:58.875 --> 01:04:04.338]  He has banned all political opposition, including supporters, even pro-party turn around.
[01:04:04.878 --> 01:04:06.379]  He's seized all the communications.
[01:04:06.419 --> 01:04:10.721]  He's banned the Orthodox Church, the oldest church in the world, oldest Christian church in the world.
[01:04:12.322 --> 01:04:13.823]  And who is he?
[01:04:16.365 --> 01:04:19.206]  A former reported gay escort.
[01:04:19.967 --> 01:04:31.680]   And I'm not against gay people, but my God, ladies and gentlemen, these are the type of folks they've got Fully compromised and fully controlled, who will do whatever they're told.
[01:04:35.382 --> 01:04:45.189]  And now we've seen the last few weeks a bunch of helicopter crashes and strange deaths of the leadership of the Ukrainian government, including the Interior Minister.
[01:04:45.649 --> 01:04:47.010]  That's not being done by the Russians.
[01:04:48.731 --> 01:04:53.214]  NATO and the CIA killed those people because they were laundering and stealing the money.
[01:04:54.207 --> 01:04:57.248]  Some of it's allowed back to Biden and others, but most of it they want in the war.
[01:04:57.708 --> 01:04:58.409]  That's a message.
[01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:02.410]  If you steal the money, we're going to kill you.
[01:05:03.971 --> 01:05:06.192]  If you steal and sell the weapons, we're going to kill you.
[01:05:08.833 --> 01:05:17.748]   And so our insane government that hates us more than they hate the Russians, Now has us entering into a nuclear war with Russia.
[01:05:18.128 --> 01:05:23.831]  And I can sit here and warn you and warn you and warn you because you grew up in a free, safe country compared to other nations.
[01:05:24.111 --> 01:05:26.392]  And you don't know what it's like and I don't know what it's like either.
[01:05:27.993 --> 01:05:36.078]  But the 95% of the fighting in World War II was not my grandfather's and not the American military.
[01:05:36.338 --> 01:05:38.459]  And a bunch of us died and we were definitely in a war.
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:43.182]  But the Japanese were child's play compared to the Germans.
[01:05:46.593 --> 01:05:52.299]  It was Russia and Germany toe-to-toe slaughtering each other.
[01:05:52.599 --> 01:05:53.880]  And you notice the numbers are the same.
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:56.983]  20 plus million on both sides.
[01:05:57.764 --> 01:06:00.567]  Toe-to-toe slaughtering each other.
[01:06:01.788 --> 01:06:05.511]  Toe-to-toe killing each other in hand-to-hand combat by the end.
[01:06:06.328 --> 01:06:13.914]  Toe-to-toe, the Germans sending 10-year-olds, I can't say that word, 10-year-olds out.
[01:06:13.934 --> 01:06:18.418]  I was trying to think of the name of the actual rocket launcher they had, the bazookas they had.
[01:06:18.438 --> 01:06:19.939]  I was having that little failure there.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.361]  They're anti-tank missiles.
[01:06:23.442 --> 01:06:27.185]  And that's where this is going is total war.
[01:06:29.747 --> 01:06:30.988]  Total war.
[01:06:33.210 --> 01:06:34.871]  And then where's all your wokeism then?
[01:06:35.728 --> 01:06:37.489]  Where's all this crap?
[01:06:39.531 --> 01:06:46.576]  The left is putting out all this disease propaganda to make the world turn against us and hate us.
[01:06:47.156 --> 01:06:54.862]  If America was promoting populism and free market and God, we would be the apple of the world's eye and an example to aspire to.
[01:06:55.162 --> 01:06:57.544]  But now America is launching all these criminal wars.
[01:06:58.004 --> 01:07:01.127]  America is promoting pure anti-God, anti-family evil.
[01:07:02.301 --> 01:07:05.404]  And this is all deliberate, and we should all reject it.
[01:07:06.084 --> 01:07:07.385]  Even if you were a sociopath.
[01:07:08.206 --> 01:07:12.429]  You should reject what our hijacked government's doing, because it will destroy you!
[01:07:14.992 --> 01:07:20.256]  And I think more and more people, I know, more and more people now understand that, and they get that.
[01:07:20.897 --> 01:07:23.697]   We'll come back with even more news. Stay with us. This is critical information.
[01:07:23.697 --> 01:07:32.656]  If you study human history...
[01:07:32.805 --> 01:07:37.207]  War and starvation and incredible turmoil is the norm.
[01:07:38.648 --> 01:07:47.773]  It's only been a few nations that actually implemented the Christian experiment that created the milk and honey we've enjoyed.
[01:07:48.113 --> 01:07:56.817]  Rwanda had Dutch and British and French missionaries started going there 300 years ago.
[01:07:58.298 --> 01:08:05.370]   And there was a minority of Christians, only about 10% of the population, that built infrastructure.
[01:08:05.370 --> 01:08:12.370]   And it was the black Africans were acting just like German barbarians,
[01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:14.990]  living just like they were in the Stone Age.
[01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:20.410]   And as soon as they got Christianity, suddenly they became incredibly wealthy.
[01:08:20.410 --> 01:08:29.570]   And the UN went and financed the majority group that was animus, earth worshipers,
[01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:34.650]   to murder the 10% and take their property and hand it over to the UN
[01:08:34.650 --> 01:08:37.189]  and to the big mining operations.
[01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:47.189]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:08:38.511 --> 01:08:40.292]  And it's over and over again.
[01:08:40.913 --> 01:08:43.734]  The Africans live like savages.
[01:08:44.355 --> 01:08:47.437]  They get Christianity, they come together.
[01:08:48.458 --> 01:08:51.520]  The Germans lived in huts and were savages.
[01:08:53.357 --> 01:08:55.338]  And they got Christianity, and it changed.
[01:08:57.459 --> 01:08:59.319]  Why is the system attacking Christianity?
[01:08:59.659 --> 01:09:05.642]  Because when you care about each other, and you stand up for something bigger, and you believe in God, you can't be controlled.
[01:09:06.482 --> 01:09:08.323]  And you create prosperity.
[01:09:10.243 --> 01:09:12.064]  It's really very simple.
[01:09:14.465 --> 01:09:22.388]  And so when we see the police being defunded, and they're not perfect by a long shot, they're not getting rid of the police, they're taking control of them.
[01:09:23.732 --> 01:09:25.073]  With the Soros prosecutors.
[01:09:26.334 --> 01:09:27.695]  And the Soros DAs.
[01:09:28.736 --> 01:09:30.177]  And the Soros Attorney Generals.
[01:09:31.398 --> 01:09:32.419]  Look at this news right here.
[01:09:33.079 --> 01:09:33.740]  Economic war.
[01:09:34.981 --> 01:09:40.145]  Biden administration's climate agenda will damage two-thirds of U.S.
[01:09:40.185 --> 01:09:40.925]  retirement accounts.
[01:09:41.706 --> 01:09:42.927]  Such an important article.
[01:09:43.707 --> 01:09:45.429]  Now we had a big victory late last year.
[01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:55.919]   BlackRock and Vanguard, both owned by the Rothschilds, controlled by the Rothschilds, That have almost half the world's wealth.
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:01.843]  Hell, half the world's wealth is just in Vanguard and BlackRock.
[01:10:05.846 --> 01:10:07.007]  Estimated half the world's worth.
[01:10:08.608 --> 01:10:14.473]  A bunch of attorney generals got together in Republican states and said, we're going to pull state pension funds.
[01:10:16.528 --> 01:10:30.275]  out of you if you continue to invest in the ESGs, which are UN-controlled investments that fail and are not designed to work, but are designed to sabotage the United States.
[01:10:31.056 --> 01:10:33.497]  And the same thing is being done in Europe and everywhere else the global's control.
[01:10:34.057 --> 01:10:43.022]  Now when BlackRock and Vanguard and Berkshire Hathaway go and invest in China or India or Mexico, they don't invest in any of this green garbage.
[01:10:44.901 --> 01:10:51.668]  It's a sabotage system to make sure their investments go up in the third world countries they control.
[01:10:52.569 --> 01:10:54.731]  So it's an internal tariff against us.
[01:10:56.993 --> 01:11:21.225]   But the Biden administration's new Department of Labor rule allowing 401k managers to invest in Environmental Social Governance, ESG, Funds will harm two-thirds of America's retirement accounts, according to Kansas Attorney General Chris Kobach, in an interview that aired on Newsmakers and the Epoch Times.
[01:11:21.585 --> 01:11:23.046]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[01:11:24.207 --> 01:11:25.048]  You should go read it.
[01:11:25.128 --> 01:11:25.988]  You should go watch it.
[01:11:26.009 --> 01:11:29.632]  You should go share it, because it's designed to fail.
[01:11:30.272 --> 01:11:32.474]  They don't have enough cobalt that's been discovered.
[01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:39.873]  To transfer 20% of the world's cars to battery.
[01:11:40.313 --> 01:11:41.834]  We don't have the material.
[01:11:44.596 --> 01:11:48.918]  So whether it's windmills or whether it's batteries, it's not the new thing.
[01:11:49.278 --> 01:11:52.520]  It's to make you give up what works to get the failure.
[01:11:56.023 --> 01:12:03.227]  Ford sold almost all of its stake in Rivian last year, the electric truck company.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:06.921]  They know it's a pump and dump.
[01:12:06.961 --> 01:12:07.782]  They know it's a fail.
[01:12:08.062 --> 01:12:08.722]  But they don't care.
[01:12:09.182 --> 01:12:17.328]  Netflix strikes partnership with GM so that all you'll see is EVs in Netflix programs.
[01:12:18.349 --> 01:12:19.450]  That's the brainwashing.
[01:12:21.231 --> 01:12:28.156]  And that it's Africans as young as six years old slaving in the cobalt mines to haul this stuff back out.
[01:12:32.506 --> 01:12:49.571]  And you sit there and you tell a leftist that, but to them it's a religious sacrament that they're good and they've got an electric car, even though the average electric car won't start cutting carbon until it has over 60,000 miles on it.
[01:12:50.591 --> 01:12:55.612]  And most of them are powered by coal-powered plants, which they're shutting down as well.
[01:12:56.032 --> 01:13:01.634]  So when there's power problems in California and New York, what do they tell EV owners to do?
[01:13:03.891 --> 01:13:05.032]  Don't drive your car.
[01:13:05.112 --> 01:13:05.933]  Don't charge it.
[01:13:06.373 --> 01:13:07.894]  There's not enough electricity.
[01:13:08.395 --> 01:13:12.878]  And electricity prices in the last two years have doubled on average.
[01:13:13.619 --> 01:13:15.280]  That is a weaponization.
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.602]  That's taking away your discretionary income.
[01:13:17.942 --> 01:13:19.383]  That's assaulting you.
[01:13:20.844 --> 01:13:24.347]  More than somebody going into your bank account and taking half your money out.
[01:13:24.787 --> 01:13:27.189]  Or walking in your house and stealing your wife's wedding ring.
[01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:29.991]  But we sit there and we let them do it.
[01:13:30.091 --> 01:13:45.902]   And then once the crisis starts, And once there's not enough energy and once your power bills go up, Bill Gates helped quarterback an operation with the UN in Australia where they put price controls on the coal plants and the coal producers where they can't have as many coal plants.
[01:13:46.222 --> 01:13:47.463]  They're shutting a bunch of them down.
[01:13:47.943 --> 01:13:55.589]  And then when power prices go up, they blame the coal producers and put a price control on them, not on the wind power.
[01:13:59.052 --> 01:14:06.434]   Are they financing Systems that actually work?
[01:14:06.674 --> 01:14:06.895]  No.
[01:14:08.735 --> 01:14:23.462]  There's all these technologies where you can drill down just a few hundred feet in some cases, thousands of feet in others, and gather the thermal power of the earth to turn turbines, but they don't want that because that's actually quote clean and works.
[01:14:24.903 --> 01:14:33.101]   Instead they build in deserts in the middle of nowhere, these huge arrays that create incredible amounts of,
[01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:36.523]  quote, carbon to make the windmills.
[01:14:36.523 --> 01:14:41.063]   And most estimates show in a 20 year lifetime, one of those windmills,
[01:14:41.063 --> 01:14:43.903]  which it turns don't last but a few years, they claim 20.
[01:14:43.903 --> 01:14:50.422]   It took more carbon to make those windmills than they'll ever produce.
[01:14:50.356 --> 01:15:06.609]  It's all a fraud, a bridge to nowhere, and they know it is, and now they want to take your financial investments, they want to take your pension fund, and invest it in a scam where they get all the money up front, and then it doesn't even work.
[01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:13.894]  Because they don't want a self-replicating economy that's scalable and that builds a future.
[01:15:14.615 --> 01:15:15.636]  They want a what?
[01:15:16.516 --> 01:15:17.397]  In the Rio de Janeiro 2000?
[01:15:19.036 --> 01:15:20.037]  For 1992 meeting?
[01:15:21.438 --> 01:15:24.140]  For Agenda 21?
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:24.140]  2001?
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.702]  A post-industrial world.
[01:15:28.643 --> 01:15:29.704]  That's what they're building.
[01:15:30.264 --> 01:15:31.325]  That's what they're setting up.
[01:15:31.906 --> 01:15:32.966]  That's what they've created.
[01:15:35.088 --> 01:15:41.685]   And so we sit here and ask ourselves, Why would anybody play along with this?
[01:15:41.885 --> 01:15:43.966]  Oh, because you get a little money up front.
[01:15:43.986 --> 01:15:46.207]  You get a couple likes on Facebook or Twitter.
[01:15:46.728 --> 01:15:49.229]  Or your girlfriend thinks you're cool.
[01:15:49.589 --> 01:15:52.791]  Why don't you educate your girlfriend how this is a scam?
[01:15:54.031 --> 01:15:56.672]  Why don't you explain to your boyfriend how it's a fraud?
[01:15:57.053 --> 01:16:06.077]  Why don't you start educating people about eugenics and the new world order and what it's trying to set up and what it's trying to do instead of playing along with it?
[01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:15.338]  Because as I said in the first hour, and as I said at the start of this hour, you've got to stop pretending.
[01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:21.319]  And I'm not talking to our general audience, but to all the new listeners that tune in to see what's this Alex Jones thing all about.
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:26.361]  Why are you pretending you're going along with this because you're on the winning team?
[01:16:28.781 --> 01:16:35.463]  Why are you going along with a corrupt, kleptocratic, inbred, psychotic power structure?
[01:16:38.134 --> 01:16:39.535]  By the way, I'm not against wind power.
[01:16:39.695 --> 01:16:46.999]  A small, normal wind power system, pumping water, windmill, charging batteries at your house is great.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.422]  They don't work when they're out in the middle of nowhere because half the power's lost if they transfer it down the line.
[01:16:52.562 --> 01:16:54.303]  It doesn't work in the equations.
[01:16:54.784 --> 01:16:56.044]  It's not designed to work.
[01:16:56.485 --> 01:16:57.605]  None of it's designed to work.
[01:16:57.946 --> 01:16:59.146]  It's designed to destroy you.
[01:16:59.286 --> 01:17:01.286]  We'll be right back.
[01:17:01.286 --> 01:17:08.286]   ♪ You belong to the night ♪ ♪ You belong ♪
[01:17:08.286 --> 01:17:12.286]   ♪ You belong ♪ ♪ You belong ♪

[01:17:21.286 --> 01:17:25.286]   ♪ You belong ♪ Let's get into the rest of the news here.
[01:17:25.286 --> 01:17:27.426]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:17:27.465 --> 01:17:29.626]  I want to thank the listeners for all their past support.
[01:17:29.646 --> 01:17:32.467]  I want to encourage people to be part of history and support InfoWars today.
[01:17:33.088 --> 01:17:36.570]  That simple decision will continue to change the world in defiance of tyranny.
[01:17:37.813 --> 01:17:40.075]  The battles that we fought together have been incredible.
[01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:41.776]  Even bigger battles are coming.
[01:17:42.837 --> 01:17:48.201]  And I know in my heart and have faith that you are going to get great products at the same time and keep us on air.
[01:17:49.421 --> 01:17:51.143]  And listeners have been really coming through.
[01:17:51.983 --> 01:17:57.367]  We got over a million dollars behind the last six months with bandwidth and costs and infrastructure and legal.
[01:17:59.248 --> 01:18:07.967]   And in the last month, I've been very heartened that we've dug our way out of half of that And we've got a lot of great products that have been sold out coming in in a few months.
[01:18:08.047 --> 01:18:20.672]  We've done the numbers and it looks like we're going to be in a good position, maybe even be able to start covering things like Bilderberg and RNC and DNC and other big events and get back to the border and even bring some more reporters in and just do some great things.
[01:18:22.096 --> 01:18:27.179]  But I need you to go to InfoWareStore.com right now and get the very best supplements you're going to find anywhere.
[01:18:27.719 --> 01:18:29.900]  You know, my marketing plan is very simple.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.281]  Supplements work.
[01:18:31.361 --> 01:18:31.801]  They're great.
[01:18:32.061 --> 01:18:33.102]  It's the fastest growing U.S.
[01:18:33.142 --> 01:18:34.042]  industry for decades.
[01:18:34.703 --> 01:18:39.945]  People know that concentrated things that are in plants and in the environment that God gave us are incredible.
[01:18:39.965 --> 01:18:42.727]  And they're the answer to so many of these onslaughts.
[01:18:43.632 --> 01:18:45.573]  And so I go out and say, OK, what's already best selling?
[01:18:45.613 --> 01:18:46.433]  What's the highest rated?
[01:18:46.794 --> 01:18:47.894]  And can I private label that?
[01:18:48.234 --> 01:18:51.596]  So about 60% of our products are just private labels of what's already the best sellers.
[01:18:51.996 --> 01:18:54.237]  And then we cut the price.
[01:18:54.477 --> 01:19:02.561]  We could sell all day long, you know, adulterated, low grade crap, and you wouldn't get a good response off of it.
[01:19:02.761 --> 01:19:04.782]  We'd make a bunch of money up front, but it wouldn't be good.
[01:19:05.682 --> 01:19:06.163]  We don't do that.
[01:19:07.079 --> 01:19:17.244]  These are the highest quality fish oil, highest quality krill oil, highest quality vitamin C. Whatever we're selling, PQQ, CoQ10, the DNA Force, you can bet it's the best there is.
[01:19:17.825 --> 01:19:21.386]  Before I hit all this other news, we have to end this sale tomorrow.
[01:19:21.546 --> 01:19:26.305]   the things on the list will still be on sale, four or five of them, but more than 30 supplements
[01:19:26.305 --> 01:19:32.106]   are 50 to 25% off. Like immune support, brain force plus and brain force ultra 50% off.
[01:19:32.106 --> 01:19:36.746]   Whole food, multivitamin, vitamin C with zinc. I can sit in an hour just on that formula.
[01:19:36.746 --> 01:19:40.585]   It's 1100% daily allowance from the Rosehips. The Linus Pauling won a Nobel prize, said
[01:19:40.585 --> 01:19:44.385]   it was the best with the zinc for better upload. It just makes your life better, makes you
[01:19:44.385 --> 01:19:48.365]   healthier. It's great for the immune system. Ultimate krill oil. It's the highest grade
[01:19:48.365 --> 01:19:53.786]   of krill oil. We don't even know anybody else is putting this out. It's like amazing.
[01:19:53.723 --> 01:19:58.015]  Everybody else puts out a lower grade krill oil, but this is pure krill oil, nothing else in it.
[01:19:58.948 --> 01:20:00.650]  It's not been heated up or homogenized.
[01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:02.011]  That's 40% off.

[01:20:36.939 --> 01:20:43.479]   alfalfa herb powder, five grams of soluble acacia fiber to support digestive health, 400 milligrams,
[01:20:43.479 --> 01:20:51.498]   sunflower, licorice, organic ashi berry for antioxidants, add electrolytes, magnesium, real organic cocoa,
[01:20:51.498 --> 01:20:55.779]   bean powder, natural chocolate flavor, a touch of sea salt, cutting-edge chicken broth,

[01:21:04.779 --> 01:21:08.720]   My shoulder was hurting, my knee was hurting, my Achilles, this was gone for years,
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:12.960]   should've gone and gotten a regular bone broth, they work great, B4 chicken, Mars's chicken,
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.460]  that's what they say is the best for immune system.
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:19.440]  Should've taken it a month ago, shoulder pain gone.
[01:21:19.398 --> 01:21:23.220]  Cause I mean, I can, I'm not super strong or anything, but I can bench press still 300 pounds.
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:28.602]  I can, I can shoulder press 200 pounds if I need to, but I mean, I couldn't do a hundred pounds.
[01:21:29.605 --> 01:21:31.586]  Because of an old tear and stuff.
[01:21:31.606 --> 01:21:32.787]  I've been on this, boom, no pain.
[01:21:33.387 --> 01:21:34.908]  I mean, it just really, really works.
[01:21:35.468 --> 01:21:36.629]  Infowarrestore.com.
[01:21:36.729 --> 01:21:38.110]  I'm like, where has this been?
[01:21:38.130 --> 01:21:39.871]  I was actually mad at myself.
[01:21:40.011 --> 01:21:40.952]  Why did I get another brand?
[01:21:41.232 --> 01:21:45.855]  There's some other great brands out there, but ours is the strongest and the best you're going to find, and it supports the InfoWar.
[01:21:46.275 --> 01:21:47.736]  So check out Bone Broth today.
[01:21:48.116 --> 01:21:50.177]  Infowarrestore.com or AAA253-3139.
[01:21:50.217 --> 01:21:53.279]  All right, let me hit the rest of the news ahead of Sunday Night Live.
[01:21:57.606 --> 01:22:05.132]  And I thought that yesterday's Saturday emergency broadcast was pretty informative with Robert Barnes, Drew Hernandez, and others.
[01:22:05.732 --> 01:22:07.293]  So I gave Owen Schroer the night off.
[01:22:07.713 --> 01:22:12.677]  We're going to re-air that emergency report from 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:22:12.737 --> 01:22:14.398]  And then Harrison Smith's back 8 a.m.
[01:22:14.418 --> 01:22:14.799]  tomorrow.
[01:22:15.159 --> 01:22:16.860]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:19.502]  The American Journal, I'm back 11 a.m., Lord willing.
[01:22:19.942 --> 01:22:21.343]  And just take none of this for granted.
[01:22:21.784 --> 01:22:22.884]  And of course, 3 p.m.
[01:22:22.924 --> 01:22:25.446]  Central, The War Room with the great Owen Schroer.
[01:22:25.907 --> 01:22:26.407]  All right.
[01:22:26.407 --> 01:22:34.226]  Let's hit the news.
[01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:35.610]  So I've got the video clip.
[01:22:35.631 --> 01:22:44.435]  I'm not going to play it, but the left flips out on ABC News because their poll shows Trump way ahead of Biden if there was a rematch right now.
[01:22:44.935 --> 01:22:48.657]  Well, I mean, they stole to begin with, but the lead's even bigger.
[01:22:49.517 --> 01:22:51.398]  So they are really, really, really, really scared.
[01:22:52.178 --> 01:22:56.160]  So some will say, well, then should we just then not vote?
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:57.361]  No, you have to vote.
[01:22:58.359 --> 01:23:02.062]  To show the fraud and to force it out in the open.
[01:23:02.582 --> 01:23:05.544]  But no one is buying that Biden actually won the election.
[01:23:06.545 --> 01:23:07.686]  Now let's get into crime.
[01:23:09.747 --> 01:23:11.168]  Again, I know most of you know this.
[01:23:11.768 --> 01:23:13.169]  The show is for new listeners, mainly.
[01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:16.652]  We did a lot of deep stuff, but a lot of stuff is for new people.
[01:23:17.733 --> 01:23:27.960]  When the government has private bodyguards and city councils hire private bodyguards, but defund the police, they know that's going to create massive crime.
[01:23:29.431 --> 01:23:39.733]  Because especially in Democrat-controlled cities where they've demonized the use of self-defense, the DAs go after people that defend themselves, and then you just green light to go out and commit crime.
[01:23:39.893 --> 01:23:40.714]  Why would you do that?
[01:23:40.774 --> 01:23:41.514]  To give up hope?
[01:23:41.894 --> 01:23:42.934]  To destroy society?
[01:23:42.954 --> 01:23:46.295]  So there's a study out.
[01:23:46.535 --> 01:23:47.895]  This is up on GatewayPundit.com.
[01:23:47.915 --> 01:23:49.155]  It's also on Infowars.com.
[01:23:49.796 --> 01:23:51.156]  Study reveals what we already know.
[01:23:54.025 --> 01:23:58.289]  Many Chicago neighborhoods riskier for young men than what U.S.
[01:23:58.309 --> 01:24:00.150]  troops face in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:24:00.591 --> 01:24:01.872]  And it's not just Chicago.
[01:24:01.992 --> 01:24:03.813]  It's a whole bunch of cities.
[01:24:04.714 --> 01:24:05.255]  Listen to this.
[01:24:05.335 --> 01:24:05.555]  St.
[01:24:05.595 --> 01:24:10.880]  Louis police, 149 car thefts and carjackings in St.
[01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:14.743]  Louis City just last week.
[01:24:17.301 --> 01:24:23.804]  New Massachusetts bill will allow prisoners to donate organs for less prison time.
[01:24:24.144 --> 01:24:26.465]  That's the beginning of the social credit score, the eugenics.
[01:24:27.245 --> 01:24:32.667]  We'll let you out of jail if you say you'll kill yourself in two years, and we'll give you $100,000 you can party in the meantime.
[01:24:32.687 --> 01:24:34.228]  That's what they're already proposing.
[01:24:34.248 --> 01:24:37.029]  I want to play the video of this with audio.
[01:24:37.449 --> 01:24:42.591]  Thieves drive through mall in stolen black Audi after robbing electronic store.
[01:24:42.971 --> 01:24:46.353]  This is the Mad Max meets Judge Dredd world.
[01:24:46.212 --> 01:24:55.012]  here it is. So again, here's the car.
[01:24:55.571 --> 01:24:57.092]  Crashing into the mall at night.
[01:24:58.032 --> 01:24:59.613]  Driving down for radio listeners.
[01:24:59.673 --> 01:25:00.614]  I'm describing it.
[01:25:01.094 --> 01:25:02.675]  Driving through the middle of mall.
[01:25:04.015 --> 01:25:04.896]  In the stolen car.
[01:25:07.057 --> 01:25:09.198]  To then crash it into the jewelry shop.
[01:25:10.239 --> 01:25:10.899]  And rob.
[01:25:10.919 --> 01:25:12.940]  The jewelry shop.
[01:25:15.621 --> 01:25:18.003]  And again, it's the brazenness because they know.
[01:25:18.899 --> 01:25:30.628]  I mean, I see these reports every day, I know you do as well, where some guy will have like 15, 25 arrests for burglary, robbery, armed robbery, assaulting people, and then they'll be out in like six months.
[01:25:33.010 --> 01:25:43.479]  So they can go commit 10, 15 crimes, they get off on the adrenaline, they get thrown in jail a couple years, they come right back out and do it again, and it's all they know.
[01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:52.602]   And that same system is trying to take your guns and my guns, In the process.
[01:25:55.003 --> 01:25:55.763]  We're going to come back.
[01:25:57.224 --> 01:26:00.724]  I'm going to play a video of a little white girl being beat up by several.
[01:26:01.805 --> 01:26:02.445]  Black youth.
[01:26:04.946 --> 01:26:07.986]  And I want to talk about what would happen when we see these videos every few hours.
[01:26:09.087 --> 01:26:10.247]  There's something I can't even play them all.
[01:26:13.108 --> 01:26:13.808]  What would happen?
[01:26:14.728 --> 01:26:15.188]  If it was.
[01:26:16.208 --> 01:26:18.389]  White teenager beating up a black girl.
[01:26:21.049 --> 01:26:23.850]  You would have riots in those cities.
[01:26:25.651 --> 01:26:29.392]  But why is it okay when it's done to white people?
[01:26:30.212 --> 01:26:36.494]  We'll talk about where this is all leading and the rest of the story straight ahead, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:37.095 --> 01:26:38.315]  InfoWars.com.
[01:26:39.015 --> 01:26:40.096]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:26:41.476 --> 01:26:41.896]  Today.
[01:26:42.977 --> 01:26:43.937]  And Band.Video.
[01:26:44.837 --> 01:26:45.677]  And NewsWars.com.
[01:26:45.497 --> 01:27:01.176]  We'll be right back.
[01:27:01.238 --> 01:27:05.061]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the company.
[01:27:05.101 --> 01:27:07.462]  I contribute like so many else do.
[01:27:07.522 --> 01:27:09.503]  There are so many wonderful doctors.
[01:27:09.643 --> 01:27:17.007]  Far and away the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's Detoxification Supplement that features natokinase.
[01:27:17.107 --> 01:27:19.249]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[01:27:19.449 --> 01:27:25.091]   This one is the only Enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[01:27:25.131 --> 01:27:25.891]  This is very important.
[01:27:25.911 --> 01:27:30.752]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[01:27:30.952 --> 01:27:32.412]  People are low with the spike protein.
[01:27:32.452 --> 01:27:33.293]  They don't feel well.
[01:27:33.413 --> 01:27:35.033]  This is a potential solution.
[01:27:35.113 --> 01:27:38.094]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[01:27:38.174 --> 01:27:40.954]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[01:27:41.094 --> 01:27:42.075]  Isn't it interesting?
[01:27:42.455 --> 01:27:48.316]  Natural substances in a sense combating this man-made disaster SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.
[01:27:48.556 --> 01:27:49.777]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[01:27:49.817 --> 01:27:53.040]  Thank you for your support and thank you for getting into that because it's important.
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:54.661]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
