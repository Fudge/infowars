[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240]  [Music]
[00:00:08.231 --> 00:00:11.899]  Another massively important transmission is now live.
[00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:14.964]  InfoWars.
[00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:16.868]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:17.972 --> 00:00:23.456]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.516 --> 00:00:44.676]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.676 --> 00:00:53.915]   A global prison to enslave our bodies and minds is in the final stages of completion.
[00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:56.954]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:55.228 --> 00:01:15.795]  But thanks to the work of Infowars and millions of other people around the world, humanity is awakening quickly and is quickly moving towards a mass epiphany or mass Great Awakening that will reverse the fortunes of the New World Order and empower humanity to the level ever foreseen.
[00:01:17.554 --> 00:01:21.856]  I've been talking a lot about the Great Awakening and the fact that we've reached chain reaction.
[00:01:22.156 --> 00:01:33.701]  I can't even keep track of all of the prominent public figures and individuals even on state-run media like ABC News in Australia and CNN here in the U.S.
[00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:46.847]  coming out and saying they were wrong about COVID and they're sorry and why there is a globalist new world order and Russell Brands, the new Alex Jones and Elon Musk sounds just like Alex Jones and on and on and on.
[00:01:48.339 --> 00:02:00.444]  That's because now, ladies and gentlemen, it's safe to do it because a large minority approaching a majority now understands they're under attack by the New World Order.
[00:02:01.244 --> 00:02:02.864]  That said, this is not enough.
[00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:07.246]  We can't just wake up to the last attack and realize what happened to us.
[00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:11.228]  We have to bring the criminals to justice before they launch new attacks.
[00:02:12.348 --> 00:02:14.409]  We have to break down what those new attacks are going to be.
[00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.291]   We're going to be talking about Bill Gates and the U.N.' 's new war games.
[00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:18.932]  We've been talking about it for several months.
[00:02:19.553 --> 00:02:20.734]  But now it's starting to get some attention.
[00:02:21.334 --> 00:02:27.118]  We're going to discuss their plan to target children for the new virus that mainly only kills children.
[00:02:27.598 --> 00:02:33.762]  They believe that will get everybody to permanently lock themselves in their houses and accept the World ID Card, the Cashless Society and more.
[00:02:35.283 --> 00:02:36.184]  But we have good news.
[00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:49.830]   Remember about a year and a half ago, the head British health minister, Matt Hancock, Got removed supposedly because he got caught during lockdown out partying with his girlfriend, cheating on his wife.
[00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.191]  That wasn't the real reason.
[00:02:52.113 --> 00:03:00.664]  We now know that over 100,000 emails of the government officials communicating was leaked to the press at the time and only now has hit the news.
[00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:02.126]  And what are they discussing?
[00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.652]  Deploying a new variant to scare the hell out of the public and make them submit to tyranny.
[00:03:09.452 --> 00:03:12.313]  And now they only wore the mask to scare the public.
[00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:14.193]  Real criminal activity.
[00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:15.574]  Now, we already know all this.
[00:03:17.514 --> 00:03:22.676]  And then it was globally deployed, globally standardized, but this really is smoking gun information.
[00:03:22.696 --> 00:03:24.277]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:03:24.297 --> 00:03:25.097]  Project Fear.
[00:03:26.657 --> 00:03:30.058]  Authors discussed when to deploy new COVID variant.
[00:03:30.098 --> 00:03:31.839]  London Telegraph broke it a few days ago.
[00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:34.277]  Now it's all over the news.
[00:03:34.977 --> 00:03:45.084]  UK lockdown files text message reveal how top British health officials conspired to quote, scare the pants off everyone and asking when do we deploy the new variant?
[00:03:48.187 --> 00:03:48.887]  Big Brother.
[00:03:49.327 --> 00:03:50.588]  Mainstream media.
[00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:52.249]  Government cover-ups.
[00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.491]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:56.332]  Well so does he.
[00:03:56.372 --> 00:04:01.076]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:04:04.435 --> 00:04:06.218]  It's Sunday, March 5th, 2023.
[00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:14.369]  I am your embattled talk show host and freedom-loving compatriot Alex Jones.
[00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:33.640]   Very honored and blessed to still be in the fight Leading from the front with you here this evening, very, very blessed and graced that you have decided to spend some time with us to really talk about saving our world, not just for ourselves and our children, but because that's the mission God has laid out before us.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.921]  Facing the truth and defeating lies.
[00:04:37.942 --> 00:04:43.005]  All right, I've done a lot of preparation for today's show, and I do like to make my points and I like to talk.
[00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:49.552]  But today, I really, in the next two hours, am going to play a lot of clips.
[00:04:50.132 --> 00:04:53.194]  But probably 60% of the airtime will be clips because these have got to be played.
[00:04:54.155 --> 00:04:56.736]  You put the live show headline up for TV viewers, please.
[00:04:58.097 --> 00:04:58.797]  It says it all.
[00:04:58.917 --> 00:05:01.699]  Trump declares war on the globalists and the New World Order.
[00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:08.283]  Trump declares America will have retribution in final battle against New World Order globalists.
[00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:24.843]   Now, countless Top talk show hosts around the world, including liberals like Russell Brand, are coming out against the New World Order and saying they're deliberately depopulating us and that Alex Jones was right.
[00:05:25.383 --> 00:05:28.305]  He just knocked you out of the park Friday night on Bill Maher.
[00:05:28.325 --> 00:05:29.625]  We've got clips of that.
[00:05:30.386 --> 00:05:31.487]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:05:31.527 --> 00:05:34.768]  says he's looking to run as a primary challenger.
[00:05:34.788 --> 00:05:38.771]  Of course, they killed his father because he was winning in the primaries back in the 60s.
[00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:42.252]  But Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:05:42.712 --> 00:05:47.115]  pulling primary challenge against Biden, I would support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:05:47.995 --> 00:05:48.956]  in the general election.
[00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:53.999]  A total integrity, super good guy, absolutely the real deal.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.143]  I gotta tell you, I'm not a partisan, folks, since the Democratic Party is such a cesspool of evil.
[00:06:01.964 --> 00:06:08.728]  It could be reformed with that type of leadership, because we need Republicans and Democrats that are anti-New World Order and pro-America and pro-freedom.
[00:06:09.622 --> 00:06:15.745]  But I do like DeSantis, I do like Trump, but I gotta tell you, that's really an awesome unifying idea of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:06:15.765 --> 00:06:19.247]  I've followed his work for decades and he's really grown a lot, knows a lot.
[00:06:19.267 --> 00:06:20.568]  I'm gonna give you my take on that coming up.
[00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:24.911]  We've got some really dangerous war developments with the U.S.
[00:06:24.931 --> 00:06:40.400]   government confirming that they are indeed training Ukrainian pilots to be given F-16s In Ukraine to fight the Russians.
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.860]  We've got all of that information.
[00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:53.363]  But when it comes to COVID news, I've been covering COVID news so much and so intensely for three years.
[00:06:53.383 --> 00:06:59.645]  The last few months, I've kind of backed off of it a bit because there's so much other news that's important to hit as well, like stopping World War III.
[00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:04.046]  But if you stop the COVID rollout, you discredit the whole globalist system and we win.
[00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:10.683]  And so the stack of news on the COVID front is so incredibly important.
[00:07:10.744 --> 00:07:12.444]  That's what I'm going to cover first here.
[00:07:12.484 --> 00:07:16.547]  It'll probably take a good 30 minutes, maybe 40 minutes to do.
[00:07:17.127 --> 00:07:19.388]  Then we'll shift gears into all the other subjects.
[00:07:19.428 --> 00:07:20.749]  And boy, there are a lot of them.
[00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:33.656]  Like Phil Washington, where they want to head up the FAA, does not know basic things that even somebody that has a video game flight simulator knows the answers to.
[00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:41.132]  I'm not a pilot, but I did when I was younger, have some video game flight simulation games that I got into a little bit.
[00:07:41.432 --> 00:07:48.575]  So I actually know these answers because I probably played 200 hours of flight simulator video games when I was 12 years old.
[00:07:48.755 --> 00:07:50.036]  Got into it for a little bit.
[00:07:50.056 --> 00:07:55.898]  My dad is a pilot and a lot of family have been pilots, a lot of flying around, but I don't, I'd call myself a novice.
[00:07:56.418 --> 00:07:57.759]  I know more than the new FAA.
[00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:02.622]  nominee who is a high school dropout.
[00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:09.224]  And the reason I raise that is, why do they want somebody that's a high school dropout as the head of the FAA?
[00:08:09.684 --> 00:08:14.126]  Because they can do anything they want and blame the administrator in the end.
[00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:22.949]  That's why they're putting like that crazy guy that robs all the luggage and steals all the stuff at airports that was in control of the whole spent fuel nuclear stockpile.
[00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:26.530]  They want clowns in charge.
[00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:31.709]  And look, they can find plenty of smart black people to be the FAA head that are pilots, okay?
[00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.212]  Or that know the history of aviation or know how it all works.
[00:08:34.252 --> 00:08:35.292]  But this guy ain't it.
[00:08:35.993 --> 00:08:42.058]  And so, people like this are emblematic of how they're putting stooges and fools in place.
[00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:48.123]  But the first thing I want to hit on the COVID front is something we saw a year and a half ago, two years ago in Australia.
[00:08:48.623 --> 00:08:53.207]  Fake COVID actors, crisis actors, posing as patients for a PR stunt.
[00:08:53.868 --> 00:08:55.209]  But again, it can get confusing.
[00:08:56.974 --> 00:08:58.355]  People say it's crisis actors.
[00:08:58.395 --> 00:09:00.255]  Then they say, well, it looks like crisis actors.
[00:09:00.275 --> 00:09:01.836]  Well, then no, it's not crisis actors.
[00:09:02.837 --> 00:09:15.942]  Most of the stuff going on is real to a certain extent, but by the media focusing on tiny points of it, they can exacerbate that and make it look like it's actually the biggest story to ever happen.
[00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:18.423]  Just like police officers killing black people.
[00:09:18.984 --> 00:09:19.764]  Look up the numbers.
[00:09:19.844 --> 00:09:26.067]   Maybe 25 black people Are killed wrongly a year by police officers a couple hundred total?
[00:09:26.807 --> 00:09:35.392]  It's a tragedy if you're the person killed wrongly by police, but is it the number one story like it was for several years going back to three years ago?
[00:09:35.552 --> 00:09:35.672]  No.
[00:09:37.972 --> 00:09:46.416]  And it's the same thing with so many of these other issues that they will focus in on COVID deaths and say this child died of COVID.
[00:09:46.436 --> 00:09:47.316]  You should be scared of it.
[00:09:47.636 --> 00:09:53.819]  When you find out the child had cancer or the child had heart defects and they didn't die of COVID.
[00:09:53.839 --> 00:10:06.432]   I saw the news on Friday that the first child to die in the UK of COVID, it turns out that they put the tube down their throat wrong and that the hospital killed
[00:10:06.432 --> 00:10:11.143]   him. That was mainstream news on Friday. But they've created a perception
[00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:15.222]   that everybody was dying of COVID and so they could scare the public. And we
[00:10:15.222 --> 00:10:19.212]   saw this in mainstream news, the US, Canada, the UK, Europe, you name
[00:10:19.212 --> 00:10:26.713]   it, where they admitted that intelligence agencies and governments use
[00:10:26.713 --> 00:10:32.402]   psychological warfare operations and military-grade propaganda, in many cases run
[00:10:32.402 --> 00:10:37.423]   by the military, to scare the public into accepting the lockdowns, the shots,
[00:10:37.423 --> 00:10:40.753]  the masks, all of it.
[00:10:39.108 --> 00:10:41.690]  And now the confirmed smoking gun of smoking guns.
[00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.572]  This isn't up for debate whether it's crisis actors or not.
[00:10:47.194 --> 00:10:48.535]  Is out of the London Telegraph.
[00:10:50.037 --> 00:10:51.858]  Project Fear, that's what they called it.
[00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:57.628]   Authors discuss when to deploy New COVID variant.
[00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:11.633]  Man Hancock's plan to, quote, frighten the pants off, close quote, of the public to ensure compliance with lockdown measures exposed in leaked WhatsApp messages.
[00:11:12.933 --> 00:11:26.685]   Man Hancock wanted to deploy a new COVID variant to frighten the pants off the public and ensure they complied with lockdown Leaked Messages Seema The Telegraph Have Revealed.
[00:11:30.047 --> 00:11:40.353]  The lockdown files, more than 100,000 WhatsApp messages sent between ministers, officials and others, show how the government used scare tactics to force compliance and push through lockdowns.
[00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:53.000]  In another message, Simon Case, the Cabinet Secretary, said that the fear and guilt factor was vital in ramping up the messaging during the third national lockdown in January 2021.
[00:11:54.485 --> 00:12:08.803]  The previous month, Matt Hancock, then Health Secretary, appeared to suggest in one message that a new strain of COVID had recently emerged and would be helpful in preparing the ground for the looming lockdown by scaring people into compliance.
[00:12:11.026 --> 00:12:11.987]  Now I'm going to read through.
[00:12:14.858 --> 00:12:15.739]  The things they said.
[00:12:16.379 --> 00:12:18.240]  UK lockdown files.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:26.645]  Text messages reveal how top British health ministers conspire to scare the pants off everyone and asking when do we deploy the new variant.
[00:12:27.405 --> 00:12:37.471]  The Daily Telegraph released WhatsApp messages from ex-UK health minister Matt Hancock who resigned in 2021 over on a so-called affair.
[00:12:38.212 --> 00:12:49.947]   The British Telegram has obtained 100,000 text messages from former UK Secretary Matt Hancock showing how the British government conspired to frighten the pants off everyone and asking, when do we deploy the new variant?
[00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:52.809]  Actual quote.
[00:12:54.751 --> 00:12:55.612]  They're going to say.
[00:12:57.593 --> 00:13:02.217]  Rather than doing too much forward signaling, we can just roll pitch.
[00:13:03.398 --> 00:13:04.239]  With the new strain.
[00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:08.302]  We frightened the pants of everyone with a new strain, Hancock wrote back.
[00:13:08.862 --> 00:13:11.845]  Yep, that's what will get proper behavior.
[00:13:14.221 --> 00:13:14.621]  Change.
[00:13:15.162 --> 00:13:15.822]  Poole replied.
[00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:18.303]  When do we deploy the new variant, Hancock asked.
[00:13:18.503 --> 00:13:22.605]  Been thinking a lot about this and think we need to be more cautious.
[00:13:22.645 --> 00:13:31.850]  The strain is, Poole wrote back, think you made the point earlier, but we need to keep schools off paperwork agenda.
[00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:36.233]  The Christmas lockdown 2020 was surprisingly announced on December 19th.
[00:13:37.577 --> 00:13:46.267]  In January 2021, Hancock was discussing further measures with Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, including more mask-wearing in all settings outside the home.
[00:13:46.627 --> 00:13:51.132]  Case wrote that the fear-guilt factor is vital to getting more lockdown compliance.
[00:13:51.152 --> 00:13:53.475]  So they wanted you locked down to train you.
[00:13:53.775 --> 00:13:55.417]  The masks were key to keep fear going.
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.901]  Basically, we need to get compliance up, Case wrote.
[00:13:58.941 --> 00:14:08.965]  But since some measures, like a ban on fishing, will be parodied galore, it looks like we have suddenly decided fishing is the next step towards Tier 5.
[00:14:09.205 --> 00:14:13.667]  I honestly wouldn't move on any small things unless we move on a lot of things.
[00:14:14.247 --> 00:14:19.089]  The only big remaining things are nurseries and workplaces, Hancock wrote.
[00:14:19.469 --> 00:14:19.930]  I agree.
[00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:21.511]  I think it's exactly right.
[00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:22.892]  Small stuff looks ridiculous.
[00:14:23.292 --> 00:14:24.333]  Ramping up messaging.
[00:14:24.753 --> 00:14:26.395]  The fear, the guilt is vital.
[00:14:28.256 --> 00:14:30.498]  And they agree to deploy a new variant.
[00:14:30.538 --> 00:14:31.959]  Now, that doesn't mean they released it.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.603]  Now, we all know that was done by Peter Daszak and Bill Gates and Fauci and the Wuhan lab.
[00:14:37.384 --> 00:14:44.389]  They're talking about deploying the next variant, which they're just basically making up to scare everyone into submission.
[00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.653]  How huge is that?
[00:14:49.773 --> 00:14:53.414]  Let's continue with the COVID news, and there's hundreds of thousands of these released.
[00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:55.154]  I suggest you go read them for yourself.
[00:14:55.795 --> 00:15:00.536]  Doctors, scientists, call on Mississippi officials to take COVID vaccines off the market.
[00:15:00.556 --> 00:15:02.536]  It's already been done in most of Europe.
[00:15:03.617 --> 00:15:07.138]  Big article from Zero Hedge, also up on InfoWars.com.
[00:15:07.718 --> 00:15:10.359]  Another key video that we're going to get to when we come back.
[00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:15.120]  Narrative collapsing, unexplained deaths, a shift in the story is coming.
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.501]  And that's according to Edward Dowd's sources, which I know have been proven to be dead on.
[00:15:20.359 --> 00:15:26.103]  He said two years ago, we've got statisticians about to come out from biggest insurance companies showing mass die-offs happening from the shots.
[00:15:26.143 --> 00:15:27.064]  He did that a year later.
[00:15:27.904 --> 00:15:33.108]  He says from his source, the White House is preparing a new narrative of sudden death.
[00:15:33.728 --> 00:15:40.453]  It's going to admit sudden death is here as a side effect from COVID, even though statistics show it's those that took the shots.
[00:15:40.493 --> 00:15:41.494]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:15:42.557 --> 00:15:48.160]  Here's one of the top insurance analysts finds a 7% increase in aggregate mortality from just one shot.
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.422]  35% if you take five doses.
[00:15:53.304 --> 00:15:54.604]  And then a really important report.
[00:15:54.624 --> 00:15:57.606]  I won't air the whole thing, but I'm gonna have it posted on the live show feed.
[00:15:57.626 --> 00:15:58.427]  It's a 20-minute report.
[00:15:58.847 --> 00:16:00.288]  Gates' next pandemic.
[00:16:00.388 --> 00:16:02.109]  And these researchers are dead on.
[00:16:03.157 --> 00:16:05.559]  Then that ties into Russell Brand and the Great Awakening.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.824]  Rips the pharmaceutical and military industrial complex and explains how it all works.
[00:16:11.465 --> 00:16:13.627]  Russell Brand shuts down MSNBC Stooge.
[00:16:13.987 --> 00:16:17.651]  Calls network propaganda's nutcrackery for suppressing COVID debate.
[00:16:19.252 --> 00:16:27.220]  Who urges countries to reveal intel on COVID origins after FBI director's statement saying it's China.
[00:16:29.022 --> 00:16:36.650]  That's just some of what we've got coming up here for you today on this broadcast.
[00:16:37.511 --> 00:16:38.973]  But what we know is what they admit.
[00:16:39.033 --> 00:16:40.735]  The shots don't work to protect you.
[00:16:41.115 --> 00:16:44.699]  They make you get more hospitalized, sicker, and die, statistically.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.085]  And they knew it the whole time and lied to everyone.
[00:16:51.104 --> 00:16:52.766]  We're going to be laying it all out when we come back.
[00:16:52.846 --> 00:17:01.356]  And then Trump's big announcements declaring war on the New World Order and pledging retribution against the globalists and a lot more.
[00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:03.678]  That's coming up today as well.
[00:17:04.159 --> 00:17:05.020]  Ban.video.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.281]  Infowars.com.
[00:17:06.642 --> 00:17:07.823]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:17:08.143 --> 00:17:08.744]  We'll be right back.
[00:17:08.563 --> 00:17:24.002]  Please stay with us.
[00:17:24.082 --> 00:17:30.425]  We're going to get more into that in a moment with a powerful Russell Brand clip from Bill Maher.
[00:17:32.667 --> 00:17:34.568]  But first, let's play a short clip.
[00:17:34.628 --> 00:17:38.650]  Narrative collapsing, unexplained deaths, a shift, and the story is coming.
[00:17:39.951 --> 00:17:44.994]  Here's stock picker and researcher Edward Dowd on The War Room with Steve Bannon.
[00:17:45.802 --> 00:17:51.707]  In this debacle that's unfolding, I'm privy to a lot of chatter and communication with sources.
[00:17:52.667 --> 00:18:10.941]  And over the weekend, one of my sources in the government told me that there's going to be a narrative change that the White House is potentially preparing to declare an epidemic, an epidemic of sudden death, and that they might blame long COVID and potentially, believe it or not, climate change.
[00:18:12.282 --> 00:18:17.865]   That's being debated now in the In the halls of government, whether they do it or not, it doesn't matter.
[00:18:17.885 --> 00:18:22.751]  But the reason why I put that tweet out, because I hear a lot of chatter, a couple things happened.
[00:18:22.911 --> 00:18:28.337]  One, we had the Monday night football incident, which raised the consciousness of the country.
[00:18:28.378 --> 00:18:37.567]   And then the Rasmussen poll, which came out, which suggests that the awareness of vaccine, sudden death and injuries is going Bigger than I think most people think.
[00:18:37.587 --> 00:18:49.573]  So I think the establishment has to address the issue of sudden death and disability and they're going to likely blame long COVID and if they throw climate change in there that would be even more comical.
[00:18:51.734 --> 00:18:52.634]  Dead on.
[00:18:52.654 --> 00:18:59.878]  Now here's Dr. Martin McCary in must-see congressional hearings that we've got posted in fullwars.com.
[00:19:00.768 --> 00:19:06.635]  He and other doctors and scientists destroying the official narrative that now has admitted a total fraud by design.
[00:19:06.655 --> 00:19:07.216]  Here's the clips.
[00:19:09.258 --> 00:19:10.220]  Misinformation.
[00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:14.905]  The greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic.
[00:19:15.762 --> 00:19:17.443]  That's been the United States government.
[00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:22.345]  Misinformation that COVID was spread through surface transmission.
[00:19:22.405 --> 00:19:25.367]  That vaccinated immunity was far greater than natural immunity.
[00:19:25.767 --> 00:19:27.128]  That masks were effective.
[00:19:27.168 --> 00:19:29.309]  Now we have the definitive Cochrane review.
[00:19:29.349 --> 00:19:30.429]  What do you do with that review?
[00:19:30.729 --> 00:19:36.412]  Cochrane is the most authoritative evidence body in all of medicine and has been for decades.
[00:19:36.432 --> 00:19:37.312]  Do you just ignore it?
[00:19:37.332 --> 00:19:38.273]  Not talk about it?
[00:19:40.709 --> 00:19:44.952]  That myocarditis was more common after the infection than the vaccine.
[00:19:45.092 --> 00:19:45.633]  Not true.
[00:19:45.793 --> 00:19:50.657]  It's 4 to 28 times more common after the vaccine.
[00:19:50.797 --> 00:19:52.618]  But young people benefit from a booster.
[00:19:52.978 --> 00:19:53.899]  Misinformation.
[00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:56.962]  Our two top experts on vaccines quit.
[00:19:57.722 --> 00:20:05.927]  The FDA in protest over this particular issue, pushing boosters in young, healthy people.
[00:20:06.047 --> 00:20:07.348]  The data was never there.
[00:20:07.768 --> 00:20:13.352]  That's why the CDC never disclosed hospitalization rates among boosted Americans under age 50.
[00:20:14.493 --> 00:20:17.374]  The vaccine mandates would increase vaccination rates.
[00:20:17.435 --> 00:20:21.017]  The George Mason University study shows it didn't.
[00:20:22.153 --> 00:20:22.874]  It did one thing.
[00:20:23.514 --> 00:20:28.838]  It created never-vaxxers who are now not getting the childhood vaccines they need to get.
[00:20:31.921 --> 00:20:37.765]  Over and over again, we've seen something that goes far beyond using your best judgment with the information at hand.
[00:20:37.825 --> 00:20:46.272]  We've seen something which is unforgivable, and that is the weaponization of medical research itself.
[00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:57.779]  The CDC putting out their own shoddy studies, like their own study on natural immunity, looking at one state for two months, when they had data for years on all 50 states.
[00:20:57.859 --> 00:21:01.261]  Why did they only report that one sliver of data?
[00:21:01.281 --> 00:21:03.502]  Why did they salami slice the giant database?
[00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:05.503]  Because it gave them the result they wanted.
[00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:07.164]  Same with masking study.
[00:21:07.184 --> 00:21:10.967]  Well, the data has now caught up in giant systematic reviews.
[00:21:11.932 --> 00:21:15.275]  And the public health officials were intellectually dishonest.
[00:21:15.315 --> 00:21:17.057]  They lied to the American people.
[00:21:17.398 --> 00:21:17.758]  Thank you.
[00:21:18.258 --> 00:21:30.631]  And the same lies were put out in a standardized way all over the world by Big Pharma controlling the United Nations and Big Tech and now everywhere, even on CNN.
[00:21:31.889 --> 00:21:34.171]  They're coming out and admitting that it was a lie.
[00:21:34.631 --> 00:21:36.272]  Because the rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[00:21:36.312 --> 00:21:37.413]  What was the larger plan?
[00:21:37.974 --> 00:21:39.895]  What's coming next in my view and my research?
[00:21:40.315 --> 00:21:41.436]  I'll get to that coming up.
[00:21:41.456 --> 00:21:43.838]  But I wanted to play this Russell Brand clip.
[00:21:44.258 --> 00:21:48.882]  The full Bill Maher interview and debate is posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:21:49.543 --> 00:21:51.264]  But again, Russell Brand.
[00:21:51.284 --> 00:21:52.445]  They're saying it's the new Alex Jones.
[00:21:52.725 --> 00:21:54.366]  Because now it's safe to tell the truth.
[00:21:54.566 --> 00:21:54.947]  Here it is.
[00:21:55.848 --> 00:21:59.431]  I'll just say one more thing about the pharma part of it.
[00:22:00.472 --> 00:22:06.017]  Purdue Pharma, you're familiar, there's a terrific movie, Michael Keaton movie, Dope Sick, that was... Oh yes.
[00:22:06.217 --> 00:22:07.278]  Okay.
[00:22:07.378 --> 00:22:12.943]  If you need an opioid, Purdue Pharma will sell you them at a reasonable price whether you need them or not.
[00:22:17.099 --> 00:22:22.322]  I should add, these opioids can be quite moorish, and even some would say addictive.
[00:22:22.462 --> 00:22:23.343]  So do be cautious.
[00:22:24.824 --> 00:22:26.045]  And you were there, right?
[00:22:26.285 --> 00:22:29.487]  There was a time where I did become a little bit dependent on heroin.
[00:22:29.707 --> 00:22:34.250]  Thankfully, Purdue were not operating in my country, so I may not be here now, and I'm very grateful that I am.
[00:22:35.746 --> 00:22:37.808]  Well, and we are too.
[00:22:39.089 --> 00:22:42.212]  And there's something called Hillbilly Heroin.
[00:22:43.093 --> 00:22:44.454]  That's called OxyContin.
[00:22:44.774 --> 00:22:45.935]  And that's what they were pushing.
[00:22:46.076 --> 00:23:05.633]   But I just, in October 2020, when the Justice Department announced Perdue Farmer pleaded guilty to felony charges of defrauding federal agencies, violating anti-kickback laws, Marketing opioids to hundreds of doctors that it suspected were writing illegal prescriptions and then lying about it to the DEA.
[00:23:06.213 --> 00:23:09.816]  So they got slapped with an $8.3 billion fine.
[00:23:09.856 --> 00:23:13.399]  My last question is just the cognitive dissonance that I see.
[00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:18.423]  That people see, oh my God, the pharmaceutical industry is capable of doing this.
[00:23:19.183 --> 00:23:21.505]  But when it comes to COVID, no questions asked.
[00:23:22.486 --> 00:23:24.207]  It just does seem weird.
[00:23:24.967 --> 00:23:26.628]  Bill, if I may say... Well, let him answer that.
[00:23:26.648 --> 00:23:27.309]  Oh, I'll let John do it.
[00:23:27.429 --> 00:23:28.609]  Yeah, you have a turn.
[00:23:28.769 --> 00:23:32.531]  John, I'll offer you this challenge.
[00:23:33.472 --> 00:23:36.133]  Get the word sputum into your answer for bonus points.
[00:23:38.374 --> 00:23:40.956]  I've been sitting here thinking about that the entire time.
[00:23:41.276 --> 00:23:43.257]  I could tell, because I'm looking below the desk.
[00:23:47.216 --> 00:23:47.817]  Here we go.
[00:23:47.837 --> 00:23:51.701]  You know, look, we have a complicated relation with the pharmaceutical industry.
[00:23:51.761 --> 00:24:02.013]  Anybody who's ever had a family member who's had cancer and seen what life-saving drugs can do for people... It also may have given it to them.
[00:24:02.133 --> 00:24:05.876]  It may have, but that's actually kind of my point.
[00:24:05.916 --> 00:24:11.760]  The reality is, if you have a black and white point of view, the pharmaceutical industry is engaged in a giant conspiracy to fuck us all over.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.162]  You are denying the reality that many people have lives been saved by those drugs.
[00:24:15.402 --> 00:24:22.668]  If you say the pharmaceutical industry is incapable of error, or malign behavior, you're equally an idiot.
[00:24:22.848 --> 00:24:34.832]   The reality is that in a capitalist society, there are going to be companies that, seeking profit, will do things that are incredibly innovative and good, and do things that are incredibly incredibly terrible and exploitive. That's just, that seems
[00:24:34.832 --> 00:24:36.232]  like the right position to have.
[00:24:36.232 --> 00:24:38.232]  I agree. Let's just be skeptical.
[00:24:38.232 --> 00:24:38.732]  Great.
[00:24:38.732 --> 00:24:40.232]  Right, okay. And that's across the board.
[00:24:40.232 --> 00:24:40.732]  Sure.
[00:24:40.732 --> 00:24:42.232]  Alright, moving on.
[00:24:42.232 --> 00:24:42.732]  Bill.
[00:24:42.732 --> 00:24:43.232]  Yes.
[00:24:43.232 --> 00:24:47.232]   Out of respect for you and your show, I've brought some facts. Would you...
[00:24:47.232 --> 00:24:49.232]  [laughter]
[00:24:49.232 --> 00:24:51.232]  If you'd like, they're actually...
[00:24:51.232 --> 00:24:54.232]  You just get the f*** out of here. This is not the place.
[00:24:54.232 --> 00:24:55.232]  I thought you liked facts.
[00:24:55.232 --> 00:24:57.232]  No, we do. We love facts. I love facts.
[00:24:57.232 --> 00:24:58.232]  I wouldn't have mentioned it.
[00:24:58.337 --> 00:25:01.097]  I'm English and you know that politeness is our fundamental religion.
[00:25:02.377 --> 00:25:04.138]  But they do pertain to this issue.
[00:25:04.198 --> 00:25:05.478]  So may I say something?
[00:25:05.518 --> 00:25:08.078]  If they inconvenience you, I'll stop saying them.
[00:25:08.438 --> 00:25:11.899]  The pandemic created at least 40 new big pharma billionaires.
[00:25:11.959 --> 00:25:16.480]  Pharmaceutical corporations like Moderna and Pfizer made $1,000 of profit every second from the COVID-19 vaccine.
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:22.963]  More than two-thirds of Congress received campaign funding from pharmaceutical companies in the 2020 election.
[00:25:22.983 --> 00:25:30.528]  Pfizer chairman Albert Baller told Time magazine in July 2020 that his company was developing a Covid vaccine for the good of humanity, not for money.
[00:25:30.768 --> 00:25:32.089]  And of course Pfizer made $100 billion in profit in 2022.
[00:25:35.411 --> 00:25:42.073]  And may I just mention, finally, and this is also a fact, that you, the American public, funded the development of that.
[00:25:42.093 --> 00:25:45.734]  The German public funded the BioNTech vaccine.
[00:25:45.994 --> 00:25:48.295]  When it came to the profits, they took the profits.
[00:25:48.315 --> 00:25:50.955]  When it came to the funding, you paid for the funding.
[00:25:51.215 --> 00:25:53.996]  It's difficult not to... Okay, but I will just add one thing.
[00:25:54.536 --> 00:25:56.197]  It is possible that these are...
[00:25:57.177 --> 00:26:02.400]  Reading Capitalist made a lot of money, and also, there are a lot of people who did need the vaccine.
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.282]  There are a lot of people who did need the vaccine.
[00:26:06.442 --> 00:26:10.344]  I never wanted to be told I was one of them, who had to take it.
[00:26:10.444 --> 00:26:14.066]  But there are lots of people who needed that vaccine and would be dead without it.
[00:26:14.486 --> 00:26:15.286]  That is true too.
[00:26:15.466 --> 00:26:15.667]  Built.
[00:26:16.347 --> 00:26:17.047]  That is true too.
[00:26:17.547 --> 00:26:18.068]  More facts.
[00:26:18.488 --> 00:26:20.009]  All I'm querying is this.
[00:26:20.689 --> 00:26:41.811]  Is if you have an economic system in which pharmaceutical companies benefit hugely from medical emergencies, where a military industrial complex benefits from war, where energy companies benefit from energy crises, you are going to generate states of perpetual crisis, where the interests of ordinary people separate from the interests of the elite.
[00:26:44.775 --> 00:26:46.817]  Final segment of hour number one.
[00:26:46.837 --> 00:26:54.726]  I'm going to shift gears out of the whole COVID narrative collapsing and the poison injections this segment.
[00:26:54.806 --> 00:26:57.769]  I'm going to finish up with the most important information on this subject in my view.
[00:26:57.789 --> 00:27:03.736]  Then we're going to start the next hour with the incredible announcements of President Trump.
[00:27:05.233 --> 00:27:07.856]  Declaring war on the New World Order and so much more.
[00:27:07.876 --> 00:27:10.259]  Then we're going to get into the latest war news.
[00:27:10.279 --> 00:27:15.264]  We're going to get into how the globalists are putting in incompetent idiots everywhere at the top.
[00:27:15.664 --> 00:27:19.048]  So they have plausible deniability when those idiots carry out the globalist agenda.
[00:27:19.469 --> 00:27:20.670]  So the globalists don't get to blame.
[00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:23.593]  That's all coming up in hour number two tonight.
[00:27:23.693 --> 00:27:24.094]  And remember...
[00:27:25.606 --> 00:27:35.872]  We're saving a lot of lives, all of us here together, by exposing the globalist agenda, by exposing their biomedical tyranny, by exposing their cashless society and the system they're bringing in.
[00:27:37.693 --> 00:27:45.057]  And that's why you're so important, spreading the word about the live show and taking interviews and clips from the show and sharing them.
[00:27:45.077 --> 00:27:48.379]  You're the reason we're reaching, in many ways, more people than ever.
[00:27:49.139 --> 00:27:51.560]  Had Roseanne Barr in, been talking to her for years on the phone.
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.361]  She moved to Texas.
[00:27:53.631 --> 00:28:01.819]  And in her words, she showed the real Roseanne Barr, not the comic, not the lady getting laughs yesterday, but a very serious, smart lady.
[00:28:01.859 --> 00:28:08.626]  That almost two-hour commercial-free interview with her is posted right now for free for everybody at Band.Video.
[00:28:08.666 --> 00:28:09.667]  Thought it was really powerful.
[00:28:10.127 --> 00:28:13.991]  Enjoyed getting to meet her and her family in person and going to dinner with them last night.
[00:28:15.953 --> 00:28:18.315]  Okay, this is a 20-minute report.
[00:28:19.551 --> 00:28:24.754]  They knocked it out of the park, recovered this months ago, but it hasn't gotten the attention it needs.
[00:28:26.014 --> 00:28:35.679]  But in this 20-minute report, I'm only getting air like nine minutes of it right now, they lay out the next shoot-a-drop in the biomedical tyranny, the next bio-attack.
[00:28:35.699 --> 00:28:37.780]  It's gonna be much more serious, in my view.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.821]  And that's Bill Gates and the U.N.
[00:28:39.841 --> 00:28:45.224]  and others running a drill a few months ago of this new contagion that only kills children.
[00:28:46.147 --> 00:28:52.732]  They think that will really get their World Government UN Treaty passed that they're currently trying to get ratified in the U.S.
[00:28:52.773 --> 00:28:53.073]  Senate.
[00:28:54.754 --> 00:28:56.956]  Or is about to be brought to be ratified by the U.S.
[00:28:56.976 --> 00:28:57.236]  Senate.
[00:28:57.637 --> 00:29:02.521]  So the great next pandemic, Gates's newest New World Order weapon.
[00:29:03.441 --> 00:29:04.822]  Here's the first half of the video.
[00:29:04.862 --> 00:29:13.690]  We're posting the full video right now at InfoWars.com in the live show feed under the broadcast banner today.
[00:29:14.568 --> 00:29:16.429]  Let's put the full show headline back on screen.
[00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:19.030]  That link you need to share.
[00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:22.212]  And under it is this full report.
[00:29:22.232 --> 00:29:28.475]  In fact, I'm going to have Jamie White that's in there working tonight separately post it as its own article as well.
[00:29:28.855 --> 00:29:30.456]  Because this is the next shoe to drop.
[00:29:30.916 --> 00:29:35.358]  This is the next bullet loaded in the chamber aimed at our gun at our head.
[00:29:35.858 --> 00:29:37.719]  This is what needs to be exposed.
[00:29:37.959 --> 00:29:40.521]  Because we're not just here to say, oh, we were right about this in the past.
[00:29:40.561 --> 00:29:41.301]  We were right about that.
[00:29:41.821 --> 00:29:50.409]   Info Wars is really about what's Infowars is really about telling you what is coming next so we can stop it together.
[00:29:50.449 --> 00:29:59.457]   So if you go to the live show feed, Sunday live, Trump declares America will have Retribution and Final Battle Against New World Order and The Globalist.
[00:30:00.017 --> 00:30:06.561]  Under that, we're going to post this full report and the full video so you can see it, so you can share it, so you can get it out to people.
[00:30:06.981 --> 00:30:12.184]  And I'm also going to have this video and article posted on its own to InfoWars.com.
[00:30:12.725 --> 00:30:14.886]  Bill Gates' next big pandemic.
[00:30:17.768 --> 00:30:18.808]  To target the children.
[00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:20.509]  That's your headline.
[00:30:21.009 --> 00:30:21.810]  Here's part of the report.
[00:30:23.271 --> 00:30:30.152]  Bill Gates has been caught targeting young people and children in a dystopian preparedness exercise called Catastrophic Contagion.
[00:30:30.673 --> 00:30:35.834]  Gates is trying desperately to stop any information about this disturbing summit from leaking out to the public.
[00:30:36.314 --> 00:30:41.175]  But unfortunately for him, there are now too many brave people determined to expose his evil to the world.
[00:30:41.435 --> 00:30:46.336]  Thanks to the brave whistleblowers, we have got all the information you need about Catastrophic Contagion.
[00:30:46.716 --> 00:30:52.337]  But first, let's take a look at Gates' form when it comes to what he calls preparedness exercises.
[00:30:52.737 --> 00:31:12.250]  Remember Event 201, a preparedness exercise featuring a coronavirus pandemic, conducted in October 2019 under the auspices of World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and involving the usual suspects including the World Health Organization, China's CDC, Anthony Fauci and others.
[00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:20.296]  The timing was exquisite and the COVID-19 pandemic started within weeks of the exercise and went on just as they predicted it would.
[00:31:20.896 --> 00:31:22.797]  The globalist elite were in heaven.
[00:31:23.218 --> 00:31:29.402]  The World Economic Forum could not resist gloating about the situation, seeing praises of brutally efficient lockdowns.
[00:31:29.802 --> 00:31:37.227]  The average person was terrified into submissive compliance by mainstream media, who shamelessly served as handmaidens for the elite.
[00:31:37.907 --> 00:31:41.870]  We were locked down, punished, made ill, injected and impoverished.
[00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:47.493]  The economic consequences for everyday people have been disastrous and are continuing to mount.
[00:31:47.893 --> 00:31:59.361]  In case you doubt that the elites are happy about this, take a look at the size of Bill Gates' psychopathic smile when CNN host Fareed Zakaria says the economy is going to take a long time to recover.
[00:31:59.821 --> 00:32:02.543]  The economy is not going to be anything like it was.
[00:32:02.563 --> 00:32:05.144]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[00:32:05.625 --> 00:32:09.487]  People are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful this is.
[00:32:09.547 --> 00:32:11.949]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[00:32:13.447 --> 00:32:15.028]  Of course, the rich got richer.
[00:32:15.268 --> 00:32:17.849]  The elites are now more elites than ever before.
[00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:22.010]  And of course, the elites themselves did not have to suffer through the punishing lockdowns.
[00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:31.133]  The World Health Organization and the World Economic Forum are both based in Switzerland, which happened to be one of the few countries that did not enforce lockdowns or mask mandates.
[00:32:31.773 --> 00:32:34.034]  It's one rule for thee and another for me.
[00:32:34.234 --> 00:32:42.437]  Considering what humanity has been forced to go through these past few years, it's imperative that we keep a very close eye on the actions of those who profited from the pandemic.
[00:32:42.797 --> 00:32:50.699]  In particular, you should be aware that Bill Gates just conducted another exercise, aptly called Catastrophic Contagion, on October 23rd, 2022.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:33:08.184]  Bill himself showed up to conduct the tabletop exercise with luminaries from the world of biosecurity and global health, including 10 current and former health ministers and senior health officials from a variety of WEF-infiltrated countries, including Germany, Singapore and India.
[00:33:08.384 --> 00:33:10.785]  What was Catastrophic Contagion planning?
[00:33:11.405 --> 00:33:17.216]  It was planning a severe pandemic, worse than COVID-19, targeting young people and kids.
[00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:32.174]  Officials in two Latin American countries alerted the WHO of several outbreaks of a new infectious disease that's mysteriously appearing across the region.
[00:33:32.474 --> 00:33:36.736]  Severe Epidemic Enterovirus Respiratory Syndrome 2025.
[00:33:37.856 --> 00:33:45.679]  Over the past six weeks alone... Alright, we're gonna go back to more of this report in a moment, but you understand why they do these drills at the UN level.
[00:33:46.497 --> 00:33:50.763]  If they get caught with actual battle plans to release bioweapons, they'll all get executed.
[00:33:51.484 --> 00:33:56.390]  So they always have drills and a pre-plan that matches what they actually roll out and do.
[00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.931]  We know that.
[00:33:58.213 --> 00:34:05.461]   And that's why the SPARS 2025-2028 document, done about a year before they released COVID, Did exactly that.
[00:34:06.281 --> 00:34:13.506]  And even had the exact same tweets just moving around the acronyms that they then later actually used as their official tweets.
[00:34:14.087 --> 00:34:16.168]  So they war game this, they drill this.
[00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:20.991]  It's like the military does drills and does exercises they do before they do it.
[00:34:21.051 --> 00:34:23.373]  So what you're seeing is what they're planning next.
[00:34:23.853 --> 00:34:24.414]  Let's continue.
[00:34:26.755 --> 00:34:33.376]  Over the past six weeks alone, there have been 500 confirmed or suspected cases reported.
[00:34:33.897 --> 00:34:40.418]  The virus could cause a severe pandemic if early containment and mitigation efforts are not successful.
[00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:49.767]   in this type of situation and trend would be a risk for the global health security.
[00:34:49.767 --> 00:34:54.486]   Pandemics are inherently political, financial, and so much broader.
[00:34:54.486 --> 00:34:59.526]  We have not spoken on the leadership in country.
[00:34:59.754 --> 00:35:02.536]  And I think that we need to be also very careful.
[00:35:02.776 --> 00:35:09.101]  We cannot decide a lot of things without the leaders be involved and agree on that.
[00:35:09.361 --> 00:35:11.963]  There is no substitute for national leadership.
[00:35:12.203 --> 00:35:15.625]  It's important to support the local response and the national response.
[00:35:15.965 --> 00:35:26.313]  Training those that are in these areas first, enabling them with the tools, protecting them, and if need be, regional solidarity first.
[00:35:26.795 --> 00:35:28.956]  At this stage, communication is key.
[00:35:29.676 --> 00:35:37.058]  And communication should include not just scientists with data, but also social, religious and political leaders.
[00:35:37.198 --> 00:35:37.539]  Trust.
[00:35:38.059 --> 00:35:39.399]  This is an essential issue.
[00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:48.882]  And trust was broken among countries, between populations and healthcare systems, between healthcare systems and governments.
[00:35:49.122 --> 00:35:56.289]   I'm very sorry to say that In 2025, we need to strengthen the health system.
[00:35:56.369 --> 00:35:59.052]  WHO needs to be a voice for the voiceless.
[00:35:59.072 --> 00:36:06.361]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:09.477 --> 00:36:18.201]  As of today, there have been an estimated 1 billion cases worldwide, with more than 20 million deaths, including nearly 15 million children.
[00:36:18.762 --> 00:36:22.463]  Countless millions are alive, but left with paralysis or brain damage.
[00:36:22.944 --> 00:36:29.707]  The most successful countries are those which invested in preparedness and trained for this moment years in advance.
[00:36:30.227 --> 00:36:36.790]  This included having full-time pandemic preparedness and response teams, which conducted detailed operational planning.
[00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:37.591]  Alright, pause.
[00:36:39.253 --> 00:36:40.895]  The rest of the report is about 12 minutes long.
[00:36:40.915 --> 00:36:45.461]  It's in the most important areas.
[00:36:46.082 --> 00:36:47.103]  It's a drill by the U.N.
[00:36:47.143 --> 00:36:51.829]  and the big corporations to take over everything, to take over your body, to make you take more poison shots.
[00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:54.352]  And whatever they drill for is exactly what comes next.
[00:36:55.228 --> 00:36:56.088]  I don't know, guys.
[00:36:56.108 --> 00:36:58.069]  Do you think the beard is intimidating?
[00:36:58.089 --> 00:36:59.229]  Do you think it's too much?
[00:36:59.048 --> 00:37:03.927]   these mass murderers. Now, they created COVID, created the poison shots, lied to Congress about
[00:37:03.927 --> 00:37:08.728]   gain of function. It's all public now. Hour number two with Trump declaring war on the
[00:37:08.728 --> 00:37:12.487]   new world order. That's coming up. We'll be back in a few minutes. Please stay with us.
[00:37:12.487 --> 00:37:19.599]  I don't know, guys. Do you think the beard is intimidating?
[00:37:19.599 --> 00:37:20.648]  Do you think it's too much?
[00:37:20.648 --> 00:37:27.449]   Yeah, I mean, it looks pretty good, but I don't know. It's just a beard.
[00:37:27.683 --> 00:37:29.864]  It's just not that intimidating, dude.
[00:37:30.444 --> 00:37:30.764]  Hmm.
[00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:35.366]  Just a beard, huh?
[00:37:36.306 --> 00:37:44.169]  What about... I gotta go to the bathroom.
[00:37:46.229 --> 00:37:47.570]  Dude, that's intimidating, man.
[00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:49.451]  That's frickin' awesome.
[00:37:49.871 --> 00:37:50.531]  You're on in five.
[00:37:55.083 --> 00:37:59.866]  Get your hair and beard formula at infowarsstore.com.
[00:38:00.126 --> 00:38:00.947]  Sexy!
[00:38:01.147 --> 00:38:08.147]  and intimidating.
[00:38:08.147 --> 00:38:23.747]   In Hollywood, in the comic books growing up, the super villains always hold the world hostage
[00:38:23.747 --> 00:38:29.747]   and promise to destroy it if you don't give in to their demands to let them rule the planet.
[00:38:30.542 --> 00:38:33.824]  Because, again, like thinking the brain says, everybody wants to rule the world.
[00:38:34.965 --> 00:38:44.709]   Well, the Club of Rome, a group of powerful robber barons and billionaires, back in the 60s got together and they publicly wrote articles about this and said we want a way to unify the
[00:38:44.709 --> 00:38:49.809]   world into a world government and to do that we're going to make people the bad guys and
[00:38:49.809 --> 00:38:54.559]   carbon the bad guy and then we'll get everyone to accept paying us carbon
[00:38:54.559 --> 00:39:00.169]   taxes and following all of our orders because we're the saviors of the earth. That's so sick.
[00:39:00.347 --> 00:39:07.373]  When somebody tells you, do what I say or the world's gonna end, they're a cult leader, they're a criminal, they're a threat to everybody.
[00:39:07.753 --> 00:39:18.443]  And they use the whole attack on carbon dioxide and the carbon taxes they want us to pay them as a way to divert away from the genetic engineering, the terminator seeds, the toxic waste dumping, all of it.
[00:39:19.537 --> 00:39:22.039]  These people know what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:22.299 --> 00:39:23.780]  They want a post-human world.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:27.642]  And one of their adherents, of course, is Ted Turner, the founder of CNN.
[00:39:28.162 --> 00:39:32.805]  And he set up the Georgia Guidestones that calls for reducing the world down to 500 million people.
[00:39:33.205 --> 00:39:37.208]  And of course, these authoritarians, these savers of the earth, they're going to oversee it all.
[00:39:37.788 --> 00:39:41.292]  Here at InfoWars, we're fighting back against this cult.
[00:39:41.732 --> 00:39:58.789]  We're fighting back against these people that are telling you that you're the bad guys, you've been cast as that, I've been cast as that, and they are the saviors of the earth who are going to fly around on their private jets and live in palaces and have five kids, but you can't have a car, you can't have air conditioning, and you can't have children.
[00:39:59.249 --> 00:40:01.630]  This is a way to make slavery cool again.
[00:40:02.071 --> 00:40:03.031]  Surf them cool again.
[00:40:03.051 --> 00:40:05.392]  And InfoWars stands firmly against it.
[00:40:05.432 --> 00:40:08.234]  So whatever you do, remember, your destiny's in your hands.
[00:40:08.254 --> 00:40:15.318]  And when you spread the word about InfoWars.com for its last show and Banned.video, you shake these criminals to their very foundations.
[00:40:15.558 --> 00:40:16.498]  We've reached a tipping point.
[00:40:16.839 --> 00:40:17.579]  Press the attack.
[00:40:17.959 --> 00:40:20.080]  We will have a pro-human future.
[00:40:21.061 --> 00:40:26.164]  I don't think that we are discussing climate change the way we need to be discussing it.
[00:40:29.915 --> 00:40:34.516]  We are in the midst of climate change right now, and it is only going to get worse.
[00:40:34.736 --> 00:40:37.937]  The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[00:40:38.077 --> 00:40:43.159]  The scientists also tell us, have 12 years in which to answer that question.
[00:40:43.479 --> 00:40:45.680]  12 years within which to act.
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.841]  Like, this is the war, this is our World War II.
[00:40:48.861 --> 00:40:51.522]  We have 12 years to turn this around.
[00:40:51.542 --> 00:40:56.163]  We are less than 12 years away from not being able to undo our mistakes.
[00:40:56.563 --> 00:40:57.865]  10 years that we have left to us.
[00:40:57.965 --> 00:41:03.770]  Within the 10 years that we have left to us, we don't have more than 10 years to get this right.
[00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.053]  A little more than 10 years from now.
[00:41:06.173 --> 00:41:13.540]  There is no justice and there is no combating climate change without addressing what has happened to indigenous communities.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.021]  I speak to you as a human being.
[00:41:15.922 --> 00:41:22.507]  A woman whose dreams of motherhood now taste bittersweet because of what I know about our children's future.
[00:41:22.587 --> 00:41:27.051]  You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.
[00:41:27.531 --> 00:41:28.572]  This is about our lives.
[00:41:28.592 --> 00:41:30.554]  This is about American lives.
[00:41:30.854 --> 00:41:35.997]  That our community will be uninhabitable, will not sustain human life along this current trajectory.
[00:41:36.157 --> 00:41:38.519]  I am here to say our house is on fire.
[00:41:38.539 --> 00:41:41.781]  It's a crisis that could, at its worst, lead to extinction.
[00:41:41.921 --> 00:41:44.983]  We are in the beginning of a mass extinction.
[00:41:45.343 --> 00:41:46.464]  People are dying.
[00:41:46.844 --> 00:41:47.985]  People are suffering.
[00:41:48.785 --> 00:41:49.986]  People are dying.
[00:41:50.365 --> 00:41:57.365]  How dare you!
[00:41:57.365 --> 00:42:01.365]  [Music]
[00:42:01.365 --> 00:42:05.365]   Barack and Michelle Obama, they are buying a house in Martha's Vineyard.
[00:42:05.822 --> 00:42:06.622]  I shouldn't say house.
[00:42:06.662 --> 00:42:10.663]  This is a massive, incredible beachfront estate.
[00:42:13.563 --> 00:42:27.165]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:42:27.285 --> 00:42:29.506]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:42:31.487 --> 00:42:37.086]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:42:37.086 --> 00:42:51.086]  [Music]
[00:42:51.086 --> 00:43:07.086]  [Music]
[00:43:07.086 --> 00:43:15.086]   We are now into our number two on this live Sunday, March 5th, 2023 transmission.
[00:43:13.847 --> 00:43:14.908]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:43:14.948 --> 00:43:17.509]  So, here's some of the headlines.
[00:43:17.569 --> 00:43:24.753]  President Trump pledges to stay in the 2024 election race even if he is criminally charged.
[00:43:24.953 --> 00:43:32.937]  And the word is out of Georgia, it is imminent by that kangaroo grand jury and the clowns that we've been seeing.
[00:43:35.114 --> 00:43:37.596]  So we're going to be monitoring and tracking all of that.
[00:43:38.397 --> 00:43:39.478]  Let's play the first clip.
[00:43:39.538 --> 00:43:42.560]  Trump, I will totally obliterate the deep state.
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:43.020]  Here it is.
[00:43:45.543 --> 00:43:49.406]  And if you put me back in the White House, their reign is over.
[00:43:49.886 --> 00:43:50.987]  Their reign will be over.
[00:43:51.808 --> 00:43:52.388]  And they know it.
[00:43:52.588 --> 00:43:55.070]  And America will be a free nation once again.
[00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:56.411]  We're not a free nation right now.
[00:43:56.952 --> 00:43:58.033]  We don't have free press.
[00:43:58.093 --> 00:43:59.194]  We don't have free anything.
[00:44:01.028 --> 00:44:04.151]  In 2016, I declared, I am your voice.
[00:44:04.852 --> 00:44:07.494]  Today, I add, I am your warrior.
[00:44:07.855 --> 00:44:08.916]  I am your justice.
[00:44:09.496 --> 00:44:14.722]  And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.
[00:44:14.842 --> 00:44:16.063]  I am your retribution.
[00:44:16.624 --> 00:44:17.605]  Not gonna let this happen.
[00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:22.610]  Not gonna let it happen.
[00:44:26.643 --> 00:44:29.496]  I will totally obliterate the Deep State.
[00:44:29.899 --> 00:44:31.899]  I will fire...
[00:44:31.899 --> 00:44:33.899]  [crowd cheering]
[00:44:33.899 --> 00:44:35.899]  [crowd cheering]
[00:44:35.899 --> 00:44:37.899]  [crowd cheering]
[00:44:37.899 --> 00:44:39.899]  [crowd cheering]
[00:44:39.899 --> 00:44:41.899]  [crowd cheering]
[00:44:41.899 --> 00:44:43.899]  [crowd cheering]
[00:44:43.899 --> 00:44:45.899]  [crowd cheering]
[00:44:45.899 --> 00:44:47.899]  [crowd cheering]
[00:44:47.899 --> 00:44:49.899]  Well, that's gotta scare the New World Order.
[00:44:50.561 --> 00:44:51.982]  And that's why they don't want him back in.
[00:44:52.062 --> 00:44:53.383]  Not saying Trump isn't pig-headed.
[00:44:53.423 --> 00:44:55.425]  Not saying he isn't wrong on things.
[00:44:55.445 --> 00:44:56.947]  But he definitely was the president.
[00:44:57.407 --> 00:44:58.368]  Tried to run the country.
[00:44:58.388 --> 00:45:01.111]  But I'd like to see a pledge from Trump.
[00:45:01.211 --> 00:45:03.333]  No more Jared Kushner if he gets back in office.
[00:45:03.353 --> 00:45:05.676]  Because they did steal the election from Trump.
[00:45:05.696 --> 00:45:07.578]  He deserves to be in office right now.
[00:45:08.659 --> 00:45:09.780]  Regardless of what you think about it.
[00:45:10.759 --> 00:45:13.081]  But definitely those are fighting words, the New World Order.
[00:45:13.402 --> 00:45:16.705]  Look how far we've come in the Great Awakening right now.
[00:45:17.586 --> 00:45:20.349]  And if a country doesn't have borders, it doesn't have sovereignty.
[00:45:21.169 --> 00:45:30.359]  Here's Trump on what he would do on mass deportation if re-elected to be the 47th President of the United States.
[00:45:31.177 --> 00:45:35.896]   When I'm back in the White House, the very first reconciliation bill I will sign
[00:45:35.896 --> 00:45:42.615]   will be for a massive increase in Border Patrol and a colossal increase in the number of ICE deportation
[00:45:42.615 --> 00:45:43.896]  officers.
[00:45:43.896 --> 00:45:52.376]  And I want to thank the Border Patrol.
[00:45:52.525 --> 00:45:53.846]  These are incredible people.
[00:45:55.186 --> 00:45:56.207]  And I want to thank ICE.
[00:45:56.307 --> 00:45:59.848]  And in particular, I want to thank Brandon Judd, Border Patrol.
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:02.923]  And Tom Holman, central caster.
[00:46:03.403 --> 00:46:04.264]  He's central caster.
[00:46:07.328 --> 00:46:18.622]  Under my leadership, we will use all necessary state, local, federal, and military resources to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.
[00:46:21.076 --> 00:46:35.082]  Other countries are emptying out their prisons, insane asylums, and mental institutions, and sending all of their problems right into their dumping ground, the USA.
[00:46:35.142 --> 00:46:35.602]  Think of it.
[00:46:36.162 --> 00:46:45.416]   They're emptying out their prisons, and you've heard me say that, but they're also emptying out their mental institutions, and To use a strong couple of words.
[00:46:45.516 --> 00:46:46.617]  Insane asylum.
[00:46:46.737 --> 00:46:47.658]  Insane asylum.
[00:46:47.698 --> 00:46:50.560]  That's where... Anybody see Silence of the Lamb?
[00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:51.541]  That's where they come from.
[00:46:51.561 --> 00:46:52.721]  Insane asylum.
[00:46:53.322 --> 00:46:55.784]  That's a stronger word than a mental institution.
[00:46:56.264 --> 00:46:57.805]  And they're putting them into our country.
[00:46:57.845 --> 00:46:58.746]  Thank you very much.
[00:46:58.826 --> 00:47:06.171]  I will ask every state and federal agency to identify every known or suspected gang member in America and every one of them.
[00:47:06.714 --> 00:47:11.433]   that is here illegally and the towns know who they are. The towns and cities are the police.
[00:47:11.433 --> 00:47:14.633]  We love our police. The police know who they are.
[00:47:14.633 --> 00:47:27.273]   And we will pick them up. And we will throw them out of our country and there will be
[00:47:27.273 --> 00:47:34.714]   no questions asked. Yeah, if you stay in Mexico illegally, they throw you out the same way or
[00:47:34.714 --> 00:47:39.034]   anywhere else like Poland. But we are the dumping ground now, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:47:39.034 --> 00:47:42.954]   for the criminals, for the insane, for the fentanyl, for everything else.
[00:47:43.157 --> 00:47:45.097]  That's how the globalists are attacking America.
[00:47:46.518 --> 00:48:03.245]  Regardless of what you think of Trump, whether you love him, whether you're kind of in the middle of the road like I am, or you hate him, this is going to be spectacular in the next few months, in the next few years, with what the system's going to do to try to stop Trump.
[00:48:03.945 --> 00:48:05.006]  It's just wild.
[00:48:06.056 --> 00:48:07.297]  Absolutely wild.
[00:48:07.997 --> 00:48:09.819]  And in all the polls, he's leading the Santas.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.380]  So it's going to be crazy.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.801]  And when Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:48:13.841 --> 00:48:21.707]  declares he's running for president, which the word is he is, he's saying he's mulling it against Biden, because the Democratic Party won't even challenge Biden.
[00:48:21.727 --> 00:48:22.687]  They won't do anything against him.
[00:48:23.088 --> 00:48:30.673]  Imagine when somebody like Kennedy runs with his pedigree and his background and the work he's done against Biden, how big that's going to be.
[00:48:31.093 --> 00:48:42.637]   Something else Trump talked about that's the antithesis of the Smart cities, the 15-minute cities, the whole New World Order, Budget of 2030.
[00:48:44.599 --> 00:48:47.801]  He's talking about these new freedom cities built on federal land.
[00:48:48.202 --> 00:48:49.803]  And more than half the West is federal.
[00:48:50.163 --> 00:48:57.870]  This is really a great, innovative idea to bring jobs and good foreigners and good workers and give American citizens jobs.
[00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:01.052]  Here's Trump talking about a quantum leap in the U.S.
[00:49:01.072 --> 00:49:02.914]  standard of living with the creation of freedom cities.
[00:49:04.363 --> 00:49:12.008]  Past generations of Americans pursued big dreams and daring projects that once seemed absolutely impossible.
[00:49:12.629 --> 00:49:18.232]  They pushed across an unsettled continent and built new cities in the wild frontier.
[00:49:18.973 --> 00:49:22.936]  They transformed American life with the Interstate Highway System.
[00:49:23.336 --> 00:49:24.697]  Magnificent it was.
[00:49:25.317 --> 00:49:30.461]  And they launched a vast network of satellites into orbit all around the Earth.
[00:49:31.175 --> 00:49:34.157]  But today, our country has lost its boldness.
[00:49:34.778 --> 00:49:38.521]  Under my leadership, we will get it back in a very big way.
[00:49:38.961 --> 00:49:46.327]  If you look at just three years ago, what we were doing was unthinkable, how good it was, how great it was for our country.
[00:49:46.947 --> 00:49:52.666]   Our objective will be a quantum leap in the American standard of living.
[00:49:52.666 --> 00:49:54.166]  That's what will happen.
[00:49:54.166 --> 00:49:56.847]  Here are just a few of the ways we can do it.
[00:49:56.847 --> 00:50:02.546]   Almost one-third of the land mass of the United States is owned by the federal government,
[00:50:02.546 --> 00:50:10.027]   with just a very, very small portion of that land, just a fraction, one-half of 1 percent.
[00:50:10.586 --> 00:50:11.567]  Would you believe that?
[00:50:12.267 --> 00:50:20.673]  We should hold a contest to charter up to 10 new cities and award them to the best proposals for development.
[00:50:21.113 --> 00:50:25.396]  In other words, we'll actually build new cities in our country again.
[00:50:26.016 --> 00:50:42.380]   These freedom cities will reopen the frontier, reignite American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people All hardworking families, a new shot at home ownership, and in fact, the American dream.
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:45.543]  Another big opportunity is in transportation.
[00:50:46.044 --> 00:50:55.355]  Dozens of major companies in the United States and China are racing to develop vertical takeoff and landing vehicles for families and individuals.
[00:50:56.016 --> 00:51:07.020]  Just as the United States led the automotive revolution in the last century, I want to ensure that America, not China, leads this revolution in air mobility.
[00:51:07.741 --> 00:51:17.605]  These breakthroughs can transform commerce, bring a giant infusion of wealth into rural America, and connect families and our country in new ways.
[00:51:18.405 --> 00:51:35.157]  Likewise, through our strategic national manufacturing initiative, which is going to be very big and very, very successful, we will turn forgotten communities into hives of industry, producing the goods we will no longer import from China.
[00:51:35.658 --> 00:51:47.166]  We will also have a major initiative on lowering the cost of living with a special focus on lowering the cost of a new car and lowering the cost to build a single family home.
[00:51:47.646 --> 00:51:49.108]  And they will be beautiful homes.
[00:51:49.428 --> 00:51:50.109]  Fade this down.
[00:51:50.369 --> 00:51:51.270]  Fade it down and back it up.
[00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:52.411]  I'm gonna come back and finish this.
[00:51:52.471 --> 00:51:57.937]  But this is the antithesis of banning single-parent homes, banning private ownership of cars.
[00:51:58.517 --> 00:52:05.564]  He's talking about the Jetsons future that we could have instead of the new world order post-industrial future.
[00:52:05.944 --> 00:52:06.525]  Literally.
[00:52:06.885 --> 00:52:08.327]  And it's not within our grasp.
[00:52:08.387 --> 00:52:14.929]   It's guaranteed that we decide to have a pro-human, future and not an anti-human future. So now we got Musk and
[00:52:14.929 --> 00:52:19.890]   Trump, everybody's saying the same thing. Yes, that idea is doable and it's
[00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:25.440]   very sellable versus the nightmare dystopia of the left. We'll be right back with
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.490]  more on the other side.
[00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:37.490]   So even if Trump doesn't do the things he says he's gonna do, he did implement a
[00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:44.050]   lot of the things he said he would do eight years ago, six years ago.
[00:52:44.384 --> 00:52:47.286]  What Elon Musk and Trump are saying is, hey, prosperity.
[00:52:47.906 --> 00:52:48.646]  Have children.
[00:52:48.706 --> 00:52:49.667]  Build a better world.
[00:52:49.767 --> 00:52:50.528]  Go to space.
[00:52:51.248 --> 00:52:51.708]  Innovate.
[00:52:51.768 --> 00:52:52.689]  Build new cities.
[00:52:53.209 --> 00:52:54.470]  America's open for business.
[00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:56.191]  Single-family homes.
[00:52:57.172 --> 00:52:57.612]  Cars.
[00:52:57.692 --> 00:52:58.532]  Cars that fly.
[00:52:59.453 --> 00:53:00.914]  Not electric cars that don't work.
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:03.940]  But a real system.
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:06.662]  This is revolutionary against the globalists.
[00:53:07.142 --> 00:53:08.062]  This is what I've talked about.
[00:53:08.102 --> 00:53:12.685]  We can't just talk about how the globalist plan is horrible, but not have our own plan.
[00:53:13.905 --> 00:53:15.086]  This is part of the Great Awakening.
[00:53:15.126 --> 00:53:16.206]  It's beautiful what's happening.
[00:53:16.526 --> 00:53:17.547]  Let's finish that clip of Trump.
[00:53:18.686 --> 00:53:21.328]  Another big opportunity is in transportation.
[00:53:21.808 --> 00:53:31.154]  Dozens of major companies in the United States and China are racing to develop vertical takeoff and landing vehicles for families and individuals.
[00:53:31.794 --> 00:53:42.762]  Just as the United States led the automotive revolution in the last century, I want to ensure that America, not China, leads this revolution in air mobility.
[00:53:43.522 --> 00:53:53.428]  These breakthroughs can transform commerce, bring a giant infusion of wealth into rural America, and connect families and our country in new ways.
[00:53:54.209 --> 00:54:10.940]   Likewise, through our Strategic National Manufacturing Initiative, which is going to be very big and very, very successful, we will turn forgotten communities into hives of industry, Producing the goods we will no longer import from China.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:22.989]  We will also have a major initiative on lowering the cost of living with a special focus on lowering the cost of a new car and lowering the cost to build a single family home.
[00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:24.951]  And they will be beautiful homes.
[00:54:25.491 --> 00:54:31.836]  And I will ask Congress to support baby bonuses for young parents to help launch a new baby boom.
[00:54:32.597 --> 00:54:55.203]  Finally, I'll challenge the governors of all 50 states to join me in a great modernization and beautification campaign, getting rid of ugly buildings, refurbishing our parks and our public spaces, making cities and towns more livable, ensuring a pristine environment, and building towering monuments to our true American heroes.
[00:54:55.903 --> 00:55:01.385]  Very importantly, I will also make sure all of these new places are safe.
[00:55:02.085 --> 00:55:04.328]  We love and cherish our police.
[00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:07.111]  They will do the job the way they have to.
[00:55:07.612 --> 00:55:11.096]  It is time to start talking about greatness for our country again.
[00:55:11.636 --> 00:55:19.746]  I will dramatically increase living standards and build a future that brings our country together through excitement, opportunity, and success.
[00:55:20.307 --> 00:55:21.128]  Thank you very much.
[00:55:23.851 --> 00:55:26.132]  You see, the globalists are giving us false revolutions.
[00:55:26.172 --> 00:55:28.313]  Don't worry about the fact your privacy is being taken.
[00:55:28.353 --> 00:55:29.693]  Don't worry about the fact you're being censored.
[00:55:29.713 --> 00:55:31.854]  Don't worry about the fact you're being flooded with illegal aliens.
[00:55:32.214 --> 00:55:35.275]  Don't worry about all these other attacks and we're funding World War III.
[00:55:36.776 --> 00:55:42.518]  Our revolution is boys can be girls and girls can be boys and we're gonna have drag queen pedo time.
[00:55:43.158 --> 00:55:45.659]  They give you all these fake leftist innovations.
[00:55:46.099 --> 00:55:49.901]  Oh, you get feces on the ground and injection needles, but you get a drag queen.
[00:55:49.921 --> 00:55:51.861]  You get a drag queen story time.
[00:55:51.901 --> 00:55:53.002]  We've got a bunch of that.
[00:55:54.349 --> 00:56:05.136]  Coming up next segment, I also want to look at Nikola Tesla technology, because people talk about Tesla being a genius, and that's true, but his technology wasn't implemented because it'll fry your ass.
[00:56:06.777 --> 00:56:07.677]  A lot of it will kill you.
[00:56:08.297 --> 00:56:09.038]  And they admit that.
[00:56:11.619 --> 00:56:13.020]  And I've got some demonstrations of it.
[00:56:13.621 --> 00:56:14.821]  And why am I attacking Tesla?
[00:56:14.861 --> 00:56:15.242]  I'm not.
[00:56:18.644 --> 00:56:20.005]  5G is a Tesla technology.
[00:56:21.706 --> 00:56:24.502]   It's that it Radiation, folks.
[00:56:25.202 --> 00:56:26.283]  It's high power.
[00:56:26.303 --> 00:56:27.084]  And I'm going to explain it.
[00:56:27.104 --> 00:56:28.485]  I'm going to show it coming up.
[00:56:28.505 --> 00:56:29.806]  But let's get back to what we're talking about.
[00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:34.650]  Trump's saying he'll totally obliterate the deep state.
[00:56:36.031 --> 00:56:36.891]  Support the illegals.
[00:56:36.931 --> 00:56:38.813]  Let's shift gears and what the globalists are up to.
[00:56:39.353 --> 00:56:51.523]  Gates Foundation commits $200 million to digital ID and other public infrastructure for a world ID trying to implement Xi Jinping's computer program that China's already using.
[00:56:53.188 --> 00:56:54.208]  Look at the military front.
[00:56:54.288 --> 00:56:57.330]  Two Ukrainian pilots are being trained by the U.S.
[00:56:57.370 --> 00:57:05.172]  military to fly F-16s as a test model to see if they can train them on simulators to then train hundreds or even thousands of pilots later.
[00:57:05.212 --> 00:57:05.933]  That's a beta test.
[00:57:08.574 --> 00:57:13.815]  Only NATO or nukes can save Ukraine from Russia, Estonian Foreign Minister says.
[00:57:14.336 --> 00:57:15.316]  And Zelensky agrees.
[00:57:15.396 --> 00:57:16.076]  Give us nukes.
[00:57:16.536 --> 00:57:17.637]  He says he'll nuke Russia.
[00:57:18.746 --> 00:57:23.810]  Oh, and he fires missiles into Poland when Zelensky does, then blames it on Russia like he did a few months ago?
[00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:28.153]  Giving him nuclear weapons is beyond insane.
[00:57:29.754 --> 00:57:35.398]  West may be deliberately concealing findings of probes in a Nord Stream blast, says French General.
[00:57:36.239 --> 00:57:38.761]  And maybe water's wet and fish swim in the ocean?
[00:57:41.503 --> 00:57:42.183]  Escalation!
[00:57:42.243 --> 00:57:48.774]   Biden and men Responds to Russian warning by handing Zelensky another $400 million.
[00:57:50.775 --> 00:57:50.876]  U.S.
[00:57:50.896 --> 00:57:56.379]  develops AI-powered facial recognition tech for military robot hunter-killer drones.
[00:57:57.700 --> 00:57:58.541]  Digital ID.
[00:57:58.721 --> 00:57:58.861]  U.S.
[00:57:58.881 --> 00:58:04.745]  government poised for national rollout while Australia finds its North Star to harmonize standards.
[00:58:04.785 --> 00:58:08.207]  Global Government Forum announces the world currency.
[00:58:09.963 --> 00:58:16.869]  London Mayor Sadiq Khan says far-right vaccine deniers behind bid to block expansion of carbon tax green zone.
[00:58:17.569 --> 00:58:23.534]  So the same smart folks that were against poison shots, they don't want the green zones all being locked down and controlled and tracked.
[00:58:23.654 --> 00:58:24.435]  Oh, they're the bad guys.
[00:58:24.775 --> 00:58:26.997]  He doesn't deny they're doing 15-minute cities.
[00:58:27.937 --> 00:58:30.059]  It's also happening here in the U.S., run by the U.N.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:33.942]  He's saying you're bad if you don't accept it.
[00:58:36.504 --> 00:58:37.865]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:58:38.266 --> 00:58:39.507]  I played this yesterday.
[00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:43.232]  We're going to play it coming up in the next segment.
[00:58:43.952 --> 00:58:53.382]  But the Chinese government has put out a short one-minute video showing what it'll be like under their social credit score that's already implemented if you've done anything the government doesn't like.
[00:58:53.462 --> 00:58:54.383]  Can't fly on a plane.
[00:58:54.683 --> 00:58:55.444]  Can't get on a train.
[00:58:55.464 --> 00:58:56.465]  Can't get a bank loan.
[00:58:58.547 --> 00:58:59.328]  Can't get a job.
[00:59:00.129 --> 00:59:02.051]  When you don't have a job, you go to a slave labor camp.
[00:59:03.252 --> 00:59:04.514]  Want to see a vision of the future?
[00:59:06.226 --> 00:59:06.766]  This is it.
[00:59:07.686 --> 00:59:08.466]  And that's coming up.
[00:59:08.486 --> 00:59:15.148]  And then, as I said, the Nikola Tesla information, the ties in the 5G, and so much more.
[00:59:15.208 --> 00:59:18.628]  But I wanted to hit this information.
[00:59:21.089 --> 00:59:22.309]  Because it all ties together.
[00:59:23.249 --> 00:59:23.709]  And we will.
[00:59:24.909 --> 00:59:29.510]  Phil Washington is a high school dropout with no aviation experience.
[00:59:30.310 --> 00:59:34.211]  Biden nominated him to lead the Federal Aviation Administration because he's black.
[00:59:35.017 --> 00:59:37.739]  His Senate confirmation hearing went down as you'd expect.
[00:59:38.479 --> 00:59:40.561]  That clip is next segment and that ties into this.
[00:59:41.261 --> 00:59:43.863]  Ivy League University ditches standardized testing.
[00:59:44.443 --> 00:59:47.725]  Will now judge an applicant on their background and their voice.
[00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:49.926]  Wow.
[00:59:50.907 --> 00:59:51.728]  But some good news.
[00:59:51.788 --> 01:00:01.614]  Drag Queen show for babies cancelled in the UK after public backlash showing naked men dancing in front of six-month, one-year, two-three-year-old children.
[01:00:03.956 --> 01:00:06.758]  And the left totally and completely defends it.
[01:00:06.818 --> 01:00:07.758]  Same thing in the UK.
[01:00:08.479 --> 01:00:15.202]  School kids taught how to masturbate and the virtues of rough sex in lessons hidden from parents.
[01:00:16.463 --> 01:00:18.184]  The pedification of everything.
[01:00:18.704 --> 01:00:19.725]  Going after innocence.
[01:00:19.745 --> 01:00:25.608]  The Dutch farmers have another big national protest against a third of their farms set to be shut down in the next few years.
[01:00:26.169 --> 01:00:31.852]  It's all happening total and absolute control.
[01:00:33.012 --> 01:00:36.035]  They're trying to break your will and sell you on slavery, but you don't have to roll over.
[01:00:36.795 --> 01:00:37.996]  You can stand up and say no.
[01:00:38.036 --> 01:00:38.637]  We're doing it.
[01:00:39.077 --> 01:00:43.301]  We've already won some major battles, but we're going to win the war together with God's help.
[01:00:44.222 --> 01:00:45.303]  Remember the coordinates of freedom.
[01:00:45.443 --> 01:00:46.344]  Ban.video.
[01:00:46.764 --> 01:00:47.885]  Infowars.com.
[01:00:48.305 --> 01:00:49.286]  Newswars.com.
[01:00:49.687 --> 01:00:51.188]  Have you shared the links today?
[01:00:53.830 --> 01:01:09.174]   Remember, while most of us are somewhat healthy and happy and secure tonight, That people are starving to death around the world under UN globalist sanctions caused by the two years of lockdowns being organized into giant armies who invade the United States and Europe.
[01:01:10.674 --> 01:01:26.441]  And remember that nearly a million people are without power as blackouts and blizzards leave Americans stranded all over areas of Northern California and other parts of Midwestern states with the massive global warming blizzard.
[01:01:28.379 --> 01:01:33.601]  Now, let's get to the new FAA, Federal Aviation Administration head.
[01:01:34.601 --> 01:01:36.201]  And you look at Biden, who can barely talk.
[01:01:36.221 --> 01:01:38.122]  You look at Fetterman, who hasn't been seen in a month.
[01:01:39.482 --> 01:01:40.583]  You ask, what's going on here?
[01:01:40.643 --> 01:01:41.843]  Well, it's the same thing in Europe.
[01:01:41.863 --> 01:01:42.623]  They do the same thing.
[01:01:43.124 --> 01:01:47.045]  They put people in that are totally controlled at the top, so they're puppets.
[01:01:47.745 --> 01:01:53.827]  So when they carry out these horrible agendas and do terrible things, they can just blame the puppet.
[01:01:55.486 --> 01:02:00.612]  So here's Phil Washington, the high school dropout, and the left's argument was, well, he runs the Denver Airport.
[01:02:00.812 --> 01:02:01.553]  Well, exactly.
[01:02:01.974 --> 01:02:07.501]  With no aviation history, no facts, no nothing, they put him in there.
[01:02:08.837 --> 01:02:10.257]  The media says because he's black.
[01:02:10.317 --> 01:02:13.178]  No, you can find competent black people take that job.
[01:02:13.879 --> 01:02:15.099]  It's an important job, a hard job.
[01:02:15.479 --> 01:02:30.304]  No, he's there because he's a puppet they politically control, who's in trouble with the FBI and a criminal investigation, so they can blackmail him for full control to then let them sabotage aviation, like they're doing every other industry, for the general public.
[01:02:31.284 --> 01:02:32.704]  And then they won't get the blame, he will.
[01:02:33.144 --> 01:02:41.101]   Just like in France, they banned this year, 200, 300, 400, 500 mile domestic flights, you can take a train.
[01:02:42.382 --> 01:02:44.063]  Because planes are bad for carbon.
[01:02:44.824 --> 01:02:46.665]  Here's the clip of him being grilled in Congress.
[01:02:47.746 --> 01:02:53.110]  Can you quickly tell me what airspace requires an ADS-B transponder?
[01:02:53.451 --> 01:02:55.312]  Not sure I can answer that question right now.
[01:02:55.492 --> 01:02:56.733]  That's okay, we'll just keep going.
[01:02:56.793 --> 01:03:00.556]  So that's a pretty important part.
[01:03:01.097 --> 01:03:07.355]   So what are the six types of special use airspace That protect us national security that appear on FAA charts.
[01:03:08.516 --> 01:03:10.297]  Sorry, Senator, I cannot answer that question.
[01:03:10.617 --> 01:03:14.460]  So what are the operational limitations of a pilot flying under BasicMed?
[01:03:14.741 --> 01:03:24.969]  Senator, I'm not a pilot, so... But obviously you'd never see the Federal Aviation Administration, so any idea what those restrictions are under BasicMed?
[01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.770]  Quickly?
[01:03:27.091 --> 01:03:29.853]  Well, some of the restrictions, I think, would be high blood pressure.
[01:03:30.374 --> 01:03:39.822]  Some of them would be... It's more like how many passengers per airplane, how many pounds in different categories, and what altitude you can fly under.
[01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:44.626]  So, and then the amount of knots, it's under 250 knots.
[01:03:44.686 --> 01:03:47.588]  So, it's not having anything to do with blood pressure.
[01:03:47.668 --> 01:03:50.351]  So, can you tell me what causes an aircraft to spin or stall?
[01:03:51.898 --> 01:03:53.381]  Again, Senator, I'm not a pilot.
[01:03:54.202 --> 01:03:55.944]  Okay, let's keep going.
[01:03:56.465 --> 01:04:01.232]  What are the three aircraft certifications the FAA requires as part of the manufacturing process?
[01:04:01.492 --> 01:04:02.053]  Quickly, please.
[01:04:04.236 --> 01:04:06.099]  Three aircraft certifications.
[01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:18.313]  Again, what I would say to that is that one of my first priorities would be to fully implement that Certification Act and report... You know the three types, Mr. Washington?
[01:04:19.134 --> 01:04:19.714]  The three types?
[01:04:19.974 --> 01:04:20.034]  No.
[01:04:20.054 --> 01:04:20.294]  Okay.
[01:04:20.734 --> 01:04:24.015]  Yeah, that's Type Certificate, Production Certificate, and Airworthiness Certificate.
[01:04:24.215 --> 01:04:24.455]  Okay.
[01:04:24.815 --> 01:04:25.055]  All right.
[01:04:25.235 --> 01:04:26.396]  Let's just keep going and see if we can...
[01:04:27.743 --> 01:04:28.743]  Um, get lucky here.
[01:04:29.243 --> 01:04:34.465]  So can you tell me what the minimum separation distance is for landing and departing airliners during the daytime?
[01:04:34.925 --> 01:04:36.405]  Mr. Washington?
[01:04:36.565 --> 01:04:38.206]  I don't want to guess on that, Senator.
[01:04:38.506 --> 01:04:44.607]  Are you familiar with the difference between Part 107 and Part 44809 when it comes to unmanned aerial standards?
[01:04:45.527 --> 01:04:47.908]  Unmanned aerial... Unmanned, like drones?
[01:04:48.088 --> 01:04:48.888]  Are you familiar with the difference?
[01:04:49.108 --> 01:04:49.608]  Yes, yes.
[01:04:49.628 --> 01:04:54.890]  Okay, you know the difference between those two, Part 44809 and Part 107?
[01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:56.270]  Do you know the difference there?
[01:04:57.196 --> 01:04:57.857]  No, I cannot.
[01:04:57.877 --> 01:04:58.797]  It's okay.
[01:04:58.917 --> 01:04:59.358]  I'll let out.
[01:05:01.459 --> 01:05:04.362]  We own some drones to cover the border and other events.
[01:05:04.382 --> 01:05:06.444]  We've got to follow federal law and know what it is.
[01:05:07.424 --> 01:05:11.408]  And the different regulations you're talking about is how high a drone can fly and how high it can't.
[01:05:12.809 --> 01:05:19.654]  So they want somebody in there that knows nothing about it so they can do whatever they want.
[01:05:20.535 --> 01:05:28.157]   Emblematic of Fetterman and of Biden and people like Phil Washington.
[01:05:30.539 --> 01:05:31.340]  There's a plan here.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:35.583]  Remember 20 years ago, people didn't believe me or Rush Limbaugh.
[01:05:35.623 --> 01:05:45.710]  We were covering federal policy being proposed by the Clintons that passed in regulatory funding to teach fuzzy math 2 plus 2 equals 10.
[01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:46.211]  Not 4.
[01:05:49.537 --> 01:05:54.479]  And then now, 90 plus percent of school children can't pass reading, writing, or arithmetic.
[01:05:54.499 --> 01:05:56.840]  In some school districts, no one can pass it.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.702]  Not one person, in places like Chicago.
[01:06:01.502 --> 01:06:03.123]  That's the deliberate dumbing down.
[01:06:03.403 --> 01:06:05.344]  But they know all about how America's racist.
[01:06:05.364 --> 01:06:07.845]  They know all about how private ownership of guns is bad.
[01:06:07.865 --> 01:06:09.566]  They know all about how pedophilia is good.
[01:06:10.306 --> 01:06:13.828]  They know all about how to be victims, and about reparations.
[01:06:14.918 --> 01:06:25.961]  And now this out of Columbia University, Ivy League University ditches standardized testing, will now judge an applicant background on their background and their voice.
[01:06:28.542 --> 01:06:29.742]  Their voice, what do they say?
[01:06:29.762 --> 01:06:30.142]  What do they do?
[01:06:30.162 --> 01:06:31.142]  What do they stand for?
[01:06:31.442 --> 01:06:33.442]  That will get you into college.
[01:06:33.442 --> 01:06:37.802]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:06:37.802 --> 01:06:41.061]   Yeah, this is a piece they've got on screen for TV viewers of.
[01:06:41.061 --> 01:06:41.561]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:06:41.561 --> 01:06:51.561]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:06:43.908 --> 01:06:44.529]  Idiocracy.
[01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:48.712]  And there's a lot of idiocracy where he says, yeah, you know, my ex-wife's a tard.
[01:06:49.592 --> 01:06:50.093]  Retarded.
[01:06:50.753 --> 01:06:51.994]  But she's a pilot now.
[01:06:54.816 --> 01:06:56.418]  That really is the joke here.
[01:06:56.818 --> 01:07:01.562]  We'll come back and play this in the intro of the next segment.
[01:07:02.421 --> 01:07:03.822]  Radio listeners as well so they can hear it.
[01:07:04.243 --> 01:07:06.024]  But see, this is a designed plan.
[01:07:06.325 --> 01:07:09.728]  This isn't crazies in academia that are just kind of randomly doing this.
[01:07:09.748 --> 01:07:16.634]  No, it's globally standardized, run by big corporations to make humanity obsolete because the average person is a lazy jellyfish.
[01:07:19.817 --> 01:07:24.762]  The majority of millennials in polls don't want a car and don't want a job and don't think they need one.
[01:07:25.725 --> 01:07:28.206]  Because they're living off the fumes of the old civilization.
[01:07:28.526 --> 01:07:33.649]  What happens once there's nobody there to make them their food or deliver them their door dash?
[01:07:34.349 --> 01:07:37.230]  Don't worry, the government will come to them and say we're ready to help you commit suicide.
[01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:51.537]  And now they've got regulations Trudeau just put in without passing it in Parliament in Canada to kill people as young as three years old without parental consent because the children have consent now and tell the government they want to be killed.
[01:07:52.537 --> 01:08:00.658]  So it's not just government and bureaucrats and psychologists and teachers teaching your five or six year old son or daughter they're really a different sex and should be sterilized.
[01:08:01.039 --> 01:08:08.340]  Now it's them having discussions with them about you committing suicide and the parents say no you're not going to kill my child.
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:15.701]  The government will take your child and go kill them and it's now happening in Canada.
[01:08:15.941 --> 01:08:17.541]  That ain't coming folks that's here.
[01:08:18.502 --> 01:08:20.142]  Oh your child's depressed we say.
[01:08:21.089 --> 01:08:22.430]  Your child's autistic, we say.
[01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:25.831]  We glorify them, we tell them how great they are, how they're gonna help the earth.
[01:08:26.332 --> 01:08:27.592]  Just let us kill you.
[01:08:29.253 --> 01:08:29.713]  And they do it.
[01:08:31.954 --> 01:08:38.978]  Because children are designed to think that the system and authorities are their friends, and we sit here with mass Stockholm Syndrome, and we put up with it.
[01:08:39.478 --> 01:08:44.680]  You think having convicted pedophiles dance half-naked in front of little kids was the end of this?
[01:08:45.101 --> 01:08:45.801]  It was the start.
[01:08:47.182 --> 01:08:48.543]  Cutting their testicles off.
[01:08:49.143 --> 01:08:50.344]  Cutting their penises off.
[01:08:50.644 --> 01:08:51.685]  Cutting their ovaries out.
[01:08:51.965 --> 01:08:52.965]  Cutting their uteruses out.
[01:08:53.045 --> 01:08:53.966]  Cutting their breasts off.
[01:08:54.266 --> 01:08:55.207]  It's just the beginning.
[01:08:59.109 --> 01:09:03.631]  Headline, Canada considers allowing assisted suicide for children without parental consent.
[01:09:03.691 --> 01:09:05.332]  No, Trudeau says it's now the policy.
[01:09:07.073 --> 01:09:14.397]  But he's a liberal, and he's nice, and you know, he says basic dictatorship in China is a good thing, so we should put up with it.
[01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:15.178]  And we have this article.
[01:09:16.508 --> 01:09:27.957]  School kids taught how to masturbate and the virtues of rough sex in lessons hidden from parents for elementary students in the UK and the government's defending it.
[01:09:28.317 --> 01:09:29.918]  I can't even read on air what they teach them.
[01:09:31.199 --> 01:09:32.940]  They don't tell the parents because they're pedos.
[01:09:33.681 --> 01:09:34.522]  They're beyond pedos.
[01:09:34.562 --> 01:09:35.623]  They're killers of children.
[01:09:36.123 --> 01:09:37.584]  They wall you off.
[01:09:37.624 --> 01:09:38.445]  They shut you down.
[01:09:38.485 --> 01:09:39.566]  They keep you away from your children.
[01:09:39.786 --> 01:09:40.686]  You put them in the school.
[01:09:40.967 --> 01:09:43.889]  You're putting them in a murderous environment of evil.
[01:09:45.387 --> 01:09:46.948]  The Globalists know exactly what they're doing.
[01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:49.690]  I'm going to play that Idiocracy clip when we come in.
[01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:51.191]  Get the shiny social credit score clip.
[01:09:51.691 --> 01:09:57.935]  I promise to get to and more in the final segment ahead of Sunday Live 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:09:58.316 --> 01:10:00.977]  with the great Owen Schroer with calls, special guests and more.
[01:10:01.338 --> 01:10:05.340]  He's loaded for bear tonight and it kicks off in about 17 minutes from now.
[01:10:05.761 --> 01:10:06.961]  Final segment straight ahead.
[01:10:07.021 --> 01:10:08.022]  Please stay with us.
[01:10:08.082 --> 01:10:09.203]  Infowars.com.
[01:10:12.885 --> 01:10:14.847]  Idiocracy made by Mike Judge.
[01:10:17.134 --> 01:10:20.557]  20 years ago, now is like a time machine into the future.
[01:10:20.577 --> 01:10:22.339]  That's basically where we are.
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:24.281]  Here's part of the intro to the film.
[01:10:26.303 --> 01:10:30.267]  Things looked bleak for Joe, but they were even worse for mankind.
[01:10:30.507 --> 01:10:38.507]   As Joe and Rita lay dormant, the years passed, and mankind became stupider at a frightening rate.
[01:10:38.507 --> 01:10:53.507]   Some had high hopes that genetic engineering would correct this trend in evolution.
[01:10:53.416 --> 01:11:01.165]  But sadly, the greatest minds and resources were focused on conquering hair loss and prolonging erections.
[01:11:03.387 --> 01:11:08.827]   Meanwhile, the population exploded and intelligence continued to decline
[01:11:08.827 --> 01:11:14.987]   until humanity was incapable of solving even its most basic problems, like garbage,
[01:11:14.987 --> 01:11:18.827]   which had been stacked for centuries with no plan whatsoever,
[01:11:18.827 --> 01:11:27.967]   leading to the Great Garbage Avalanche of 2505, which would set in motion the events that would change the
[01:11:27.967 --> 01:11:29.307]  world forever.
[01:11:30.266 --> 01:11:32.266]  (RUMBLING)
[01:11:32.266 --> 01:11:34.266]  (RUMBLING)
[01:11:34.266 --> 01:11:40.268]  (CLANGING)
[01:11:40.268 --> 01:11:42.268]  (RUMBLING)
[01:12:06.268 --> 01:12:10.587]  Make no mistake folks, we are here now.
[01:12:10.588 --> 01:12:13.691]  So, China for several years has had the Social Credit Score in place.
[01:12:13.731 --> 01:12:14.631]  It's the model for the world.
[01:12:16.473 --> 01:12:27.602]  Here is a short clip put up by the government of a man with his family unable to get on a plane, then get a hotel, a train ticket, or a bank loan, and then there's jumbotrons on the streets showing he's a bad person.
[01:12:28.003 --> 01:12:29.464]  This isn't coming, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:29.504 --> 01:12:30.125]  This is here.
[01:12:30.465 --> 01:12:31.546]  This is their plan for everybody.
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:41.745]  You think you're going with your daughter and wife on a trip?
[01:12:42.046 --> 01:12:43.507]  Nope.
[01:12:43.527 --> 01:12:44.788]  You did something urban and like.
[01:12:46.909 --> 01:12:50.732]  And we are opting into this, letting it be built all around us.
[01:12:51.333 --> 01:13:02.213]   Sorry, can't find Oh, nope, can't get a hotel room
[01:13:01.795 --> 01:13:05.256]  Already happened to populists, already happened to patriots, already happened to everybody.
[01:13:05.775 --> 01:13:06.275]  Huh?
[01:13:06.275 --> 01:13:14.875]   *sigh* *Chinese*
[01:13:14.875 --> 01:13:22.595]   *Chinese* Already happened to populists, already happened to patriots,
[01:13:22.595 --> 01:13:23.775]  already happened to everybody.
[01:13:23.775 --> 01:13:26.994]  He goes down the street, and there he is on the Jumbo Tron.
[01:13:26.994 --> 01:13:34.435]   *Chinese* That's their plan.
[01:13:34.435 --> 01:13:40.916]  And if you criticize things like this...
[01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:50.916]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:13:43.211 --> 01:13:43.951]  New York Post.
[01:13:44.172 --> 01:13:50.035]  USA powerlifting to allow trans athletes to compete with women after losing suit.
[01:13:51.416 --> 01:13:55.259]  The courts say biological men can take over all of women's sports.
[01:13:55.359 --> 01:14:03.421]   That's how we celebrate Women's Month is having the new Hershey's spokesperson be a man saying he's a woman.
[01:14:04.822 --> 01:14:09.183]  NBA team forced to apologize for sin of suggesting only women can have a baby.
[01:14:09.203 --> 01:14:16.406]  And then a few of these videos, these are not joke videos, these are people proud of their new identity.
[01:14:17.006 --> 01:14:29.523]   You don't have a job, you're obese, you have no future, but The media says you're beautiful and wonderful if you're a 300 pound man with a beard who says he is a woman.
[01:14:29.363 --> 01:14:51.842]  Here's the clip.
[01:14:51.842 --> 01:14:56.923]   But at least this guy isn't trying to take women's place in sports.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.782]  Okay, that's social credit score violation.
[01:14:59.882 --> 01:15:02.804]  In the future, I'll be banned from living, basically, for saying that.
[01:15:02.864 --> 01:15:03.905]  I've committed my thought crime.
[01:15:04.245 --> 01:15:06.367]  But once you put up with this, you'll put up with anything.
[01:15:06.387 --> 01:15:11.451]  Remember, you'll give in now and submit to this control grid to your own destruction.
[01:15:12.395 --> 01:15:13.817]  Only an idiot would submit to this.
[01:15:14.318 --> 01:15:15.479]  Where's your fighting spirit?
[01:15:15.499 --> 01:15:16.481]  Where's your common sense?
[01:15:17.362 --> 01:15:24.532]  Here's a crazed man dresses a woman, tells people to stop spelling woman with an X or a Y because trans women are real women.
[01:15:24.552 --> 01:15:24.913]  Here it is.
[01:15:27.947 --> 01:15:29.088]  Happy Women's History Month!
[01:15:29.769 --> 01:15:39.177]  As you celebrate all women this month, including trans women, instead of spelling women with a Y instead of an E or an X instead of an E to be more inclusive of trans women, instead just spell women.
[01:15:39.637 --> 01:15:41.058]  W-O-M-E-N.
[01:15:41.559 --> 01:15:41.839]  Women.
[01:15:42.339 --> 01:15:42.580]  Why?
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.101]  Because trans women are women.
[01:15:45.247 --> 01:15:46.068]  Well, there you go.
[01:15:46.088 --> 01:15:47.488]  Here's another clip of Clown World today.
[01:15:47.307 --> 01:15:51.146]   to try to be more inclusive, what you're actually doing is suggesting the idea that trans women
[01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:52.146]  aren't really women.
[01:15:52.146 --> 01:15:56.028]   You need a special spelling to include them, which again is not the case since trans women
[01:15:56.028 --> 01:15:57.028]  are women.
[01:15:57.028 --> 01:15:59.747]  Well, there you go.
[01:15:59.747 --> 01:16:04.068]  Here's another clip of Clown World today.
[01:16:04.068 --> 01:16:09.587]  Drag Queen Story Hour is going to save children.
[01:16:09.587 --> 01:16:10.587]  And again, this is not a woman.
[01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:14.912]  This is a man dressed in the ceremonial clown outfit of this cult.
[01:16:14.952 --> 01:16:15.352]  Here it is.
[01:16:16.212 --> 01:16:21.134]  I don't know who needs to hear this, but Drag Story Hour is not targeting children.
[01:16:21.835 --> 01:16:24.556]  Drag Story Hour is saving children.
[01:16:25.056 --> 01:16:25.836]  Now, hear me out.
[01:16:26.397 --> 01:16:30.799]  Let's say you're a parent and you have a child who maybe doesn't fit in.
[01:16:30.879 --> 01:16:32.499]  Maybe they're being bullied at school.
[01:16:32.579 --> 01:16:34.960]  Maybe you're a little boy who likes to play with dolls.
[01:16:35.081 --> 01:16:37.882]  Maybe you're a little girl who wants you to call her by a boy's name.
[01:16:38.752 --> 01:16:44.376]  This happens, and sometimes even people in your own family don't understand it, and they don't accept it.
[01:16:44.937 --> 01:16:56.385]  So maybe, as a parent who loves their child, you want to bring them to a place where they can feel safe, where they don't feel like they're so weird, and they don't feel like they're gonna go to hell because they're different.
[01:16:57.606 --> 01:17:00.188]  So, when are we gonna hit bottom here, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:17:00.969 --> 01:17:09.348]   Soulless creatures attracted to the innocence of children, state-sponsored, Corporate-sponsored.
[01:17:10.188 --> 01:17:15.471]  When are we going to hit bottom and say no to this and say that this is wrong?
[01:17:17.512 --> 01:17:21.375]  That's really, really the big question here.
[01:17:22.475 --> 01:17:28.939]  But the good news is, all over the world, people are standing up.
[01:17:28.979 --> 01:17:33.402]  In the UK, they have cancelled the group itself.
[01:17:34.482 --> 01:17:44.630]  Their drag queen time with children, because it was so sexual and so sick, it caused a major, major backlash.
[01:17:45.551 --> 01:17:50.174]  And the only question is, what is the level that you will finally say no?
[01:17:50.594 --> 01:17:56.919]  Because that is the level that these people will actually stop.
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:17:59.001]  Here's the headline I was looking for.
[01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:05.773]  Drag queen shows for babies cancelled after public backlash.
[01:18:05.793 --> 01:18:16.580]  The UK cabaret company behind drag queen events aimed at infants has reportedly cancelled future shows, have receiving fierce public backlash in the wake of a recent performance that was recorded.
[01:18:17.861 --> 01:18:18.261]  We won't.
[01:18:20.223 --> 01:18:23.825]  No, it's for torturing you and showing you this, but again.
[01:18:27.007 --> 01:18:29.049]  This is nothing compared to footage we have.
[01:18:32.059 --> 01:18:32.980]  This is degeneracy.
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:34.881]  This is attacking children.
[01:18:34.901 --> 01:18:36.662]  This is pure evil.
[01:18:36.942 --> 01:18:42.526]  But it's about breaking your will and getting you to accept literally anything.
[01:18:44.467 --> 01:18:58.947]   But if you think, again, this is bad, the UK and places like Canada Are the cutting-edge, spearheading, killing children without parental consent because the child tells the government they want to die.
[01:18:59.527 --> 01:19:04.548]  A child is not of the age of consent to buy alcohol, to join the military, to have sex because they're a child.
[01:19:05.188 --> 01:19:09.589]  And if we don't protect our children, God is going to forget who we are.
[01:19:10.209 --> 01:19:11.570]  Look, I got to almost everything.
[01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:15.250]  I did not get to the Nikola Tesla information.
[01:19:16.090 --> 01:19:19.831]  So I'm going to put that in the stack for tomorrow.
[01:19:21.792 --> 01:19:27.496]  Because it's a very important area to understand why Tesla's technology never got implemented.
[01:19:28.577 --> 01:19:31.639]  Even though he was very smart, some of his technology was doable.
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:39.205]  A lot of it was so toxic because transmitting power to the air affects your cells and hurts your body.
[01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:46.290]  And we've got evidence and documents and information we're going to show tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:19:46.330 --> 01:19:48.092]  Central, when I go live again, Lord willing.
[01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:51.052]  After Harrison Smith goes live at 8 a.m.
[01:19:51.092 --> 01:19:51.793]  to 11 a.m.
[01:19:51.853 --> 01:19:54.355]  with the American Journal, I'm with Troyer at 3 p.m.
[01:19:54.395 --> 01:19:55.276]  Central every day.
[01:19:55.697 --> 01:20:00.101]  We're fighting hard for humanity, not just America, and we're having some major successes.
[01:20:00.141 --> 01:20:07.809]  But I believe our most important work is to come, but that can only come if you support the broadcast and spread the word.
[01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:09.791]  So I'm counting on you to continue to support us.
[01:20:10.211 --> 01:20:11.853]  You know who you are, and I thank you for that support.
[01:20:12.557 --> 01:20:14.619]  We're going to go to break here for the next two hours.
[01:20:14.639 --> 01:20:18.081]  Owen Schroer will come in here and has a lot of news to cover.
[01:20:18.382 --> 01:20:21.364]  Great guest, phone calls, and his amazing analysis.
[01:20:22.004 --> 01:20:25.047]  Owen Schroer and Sunday Live is in two minutes.
[01:20:25.947 --> 01:20:26.768]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:20:26.808 --> 01:20:27.949]  Great job, crew.
[01:20:28.689 --> 01:20:35.255]  Now, please share the article, share the videos, see our Roseanne Barr interview from yesterday, as well at band.video.
[01:20:35.614 --> 01:20:37.614]  We'll be right back with Owen Schroeder.
[01:20:37.614 --> 01:20:39.614]  [music]
[01:20:39.614 --> 01:20:41.614]  [music]
[01:20:42.614 --> 01:20:44.614]  [music]
[01:20:44.614 --> 01:20:46.614]  [music]
[01:20:46.614 --> 01:20:48.614]  [music]
[01:20:48.614 --> 01:20:56.364]   If you want to continue to see hard core, game changing, tip of the spear, 98% accuracy that just is setting brush
[01:20:56.364 --> 01:21:01.774]   fires in the minds of men and women everywhere, stay with InfoWars, pray for InfoWars, spread the word about InfoWars,
[01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:03.614]  and by product, InfoWars.
[01:21:03.821 --> 01:21:06.703]  I can tell you how many outside groups go and test the products we sell.
[01:21:06.763 --> 01:21:10.945]  Like Mike Adams is famous for his big testing lab where he tests all sorts of products, all sorts of supplements.
[01:21:11.065 --> 01:21:12.745]  And he, I didn't even know this happened with a family member.
[01:21:13.226 --> 01:21:15.507]  He was given a family member that had some neurological issues.
[01:21:15.527 --> 01:21:16.847]  CBD oil is in all the studies.
[01:21:16.927 --> 01:21:17.868]  It's really good CBD oil.
[01:21:17.908 --> 01:21:20.069]  It really helps all sorts of neurological things.
[01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:22.030]  Parkinson's, epilepsy.
[01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:25.132]  Michael Epps, the list goes on and on, joint pain, you name it.
[01:21:25.312 --> 01:21:30.174]  And he went and tested ours in his testing lab, checked it, has degrees in it, said, this is the highest quality we've seen.
[01:21:30.274 --> 01:21:32.856]  We've seen another brand that's good, but this is the very top.
[01:21:32.876 --> 01:21:36.398]  This should be $160 a bottle for the 1,000 milligram that he puts out.
[01:21:36.598 --> 01:21:37.238]  And that's true.
[01:21:37.278 --> 01:21:38.379]  They recommended we sell it for $150.
[01:21:38.419 --> 01:21:43.742]  I went to these folks that own a big company that's one of the top distributors in the country of wide-spectrum CBD.
[01:21:43.802 --> 01:21:46.563]  And they said, we recommend $150 retail, then discount it $100.
[01:21:47.244 --> 01:21:48.685]  Well, I'm not going to do 200% marketing.
[01:21:49.725 --> 01:21:53.828]  So, at $67, there's a 100% markup to fund ourselves.
[01:21:54.088 --> 01:22:02.653]  You're getting the best CBD, 1000mg, 25mg, and 10mg, depending on the one you want, at over 50% what you're going to get just anywhere else.
[01:22:02.713 --> 01:22:03.734]  That's with a discount.
[01:22:04.494 --> 01:22:11.838]  It's about 35% after the discount.
[01:22:11.878 --> 01:22:13.960]  But if you look at retail, it's like a 70% discount.
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:17.321]   The point is, is that Point Blank.
[01:22:17.621 --> 01:22:18.761]  Everybody knows CBD is great.
[01:22:18.821 --> 01:22:20.942]  Doctors are prescribing it everywhere, even though it's not prescription.
[01:22:21.402 --> 01:22:22.402]  This is the best you're going to get.
[01:22:22.642 --> 01:22:25.162]  InfoWarsTore.com and it funds the Info War.
[01:22:25.242 --> 01:22:26.303]  A total 360 win.
[01:22:26.383 --> 01:22:28.403]  Only way we fail is we don't take action.
[01:22:28.423 --> 01:22:30.643]  And I know less than 1% of the viewers who I love and I thank.
[01:22:30.683 --> 01:22:31.204]  I'm not bitching.
[01:22:31.304 --> 01:22:34.464]  If just one more percent would just do it, we wouldn't just be good.
[01:22:34.484 --> 01:22:35.384]  We could expand.
[01:22:35.404 --> 01:22:36.284]  So we're not going anywhere.
[01:22:36.304 --> 01:22:38.085]  Those of you that have bought the products, you know who you are.
[01:22:38.125 --> 01:22:39.645]  Those who haven't, hey, keep spreading the word.
[01:22:39.665 --> 01:22:40.305]  Keep praying for us.
[01:22:40.445 --> 01:22:42.786]  And if you want to experience great CBD, try it out.
[01:22:42.866 --> 01:22:43.266]  Get a bottle.
[01:22:43.286 --> 01:22:44.706]  And I think you're going to be a repeat customer.
[01:22:44.826 --> 01:22:45.366]  Buy the product.
