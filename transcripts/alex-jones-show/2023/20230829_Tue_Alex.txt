[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:00.509]  Guess what?
[00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:02.651]  About 40% of us didn't take it!
[00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:08.415]  And almost no one's buying the next rollout of your garbage!
[00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:11.157]  And we caught you with your pants down!
[00:00:11.897 --> 00:00:16.100]  And now California admits we're going back to COVID rollouts on their official website.
[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.603]  Mass contact tracing, vaccine passports, lockdowns.
[00:00:21.404 --> 00:00:23.265]  And they're so pissed we learned about it!
[00:00:23.485 --> 00:00:25.206]  They're so pissed we're saying no!
[00:00:26.288 --> 00:00:30.398]  Well, they're going to get more pissed as we don't follow anything they say.
[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.383]  They've dissolved our borders.
[00:00:32.403 --> 00:00:33.686]  They're cutting off our energy.
[00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:35.711]  They're attacking us at every level.
[00:00:37.793 --> 00:00:43.777]  But Larry Fink thinks he's God, and the Rothschilds don't even think they're God, and they're not God.
[00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:57.568]  Because once we identify that they're the ones behind all this, it's game over, and I'm telling you, it's on record that BlackRock owns that power utility, 96% of it, and it's on record everybody's waking up, and that's a microcosm.
[00:00:58.148 --> 00:00:59.971]  You think you're gonna corner the people in Lahaina?
[00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:06.624]  You think you're gonna corner the people in Texas the last two years where you cut the power off in the winter and wouldn't let us up the power during the storms?
[00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:08.367]  You think we don't know it's you?
[00:01:10.486 --> 00:01:11.407]  We do know it's you.
[00:01:11.427 --> 00:01:14.208]  So you try to indict Trump till the cows come home.
[00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:15.790]  You try to intimidate us.
[00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.551]  You try to shut me down.
[00:01:17.831 --> 00:01:19.332]  You try to silence us.
[00:01:19.952 --> 00:01:23.695]  We are not going to be silenced, you blood-sucking arsonist.
[00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:28.518]  And they didn't just left us 79 of them caught in Greece setting the giant fires.
[00:01:28.898 --> 00:01:30.379]  They're cultural arsonists.
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.801]  They're scum from the bottom up.
[00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:40.486]  And just like at the Burning Man with the tribal police running over those blockades that blocked the road, that's where we're going.
[00:01:40.626 --> 00:01:45.231]  What's wrong with you people?
[00:01:47.193 --> 00:01:49.656]  Total resistance!
[00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:49.856]  Woo!
[00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:54.841]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:17.960]   It's Alex Jones Info Wars
[00:02:17.318 --> 00:02:18.204]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:02:18.506 --> 00:02:18.829]  Today.
[00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.033]  The breaking news, stay at home, that is the order tonight from four state governors.
[00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:30.655]  You absolutely must stay at home.
[00:02:30.835 --> 00:02:32.396]  You must stay at home.
[00:02:32.636 --> 00:02:35.738]  All gatherings are cancelled until further notice.
[00:02:35.918 --> 00:02:40.801]  I have issued an executive order, it's not a suggestion, it's an order.
[00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:47.825]  We will shut you down, we will cite you, and if we need to, we will arrest you, and we will take you to jail.
[00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:52.328]  This means no weddings, in-person services, or even parties.
[00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:58.030]  The time for educating people into compliance is over.
[00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:03.553]  I'm using my power as governor under an emergency declaration to order you to close.
[00:03:03.733 --> 00:03:06.014]  Quarantine will be mandatory.
[00:03:06.374 --> 00:03:08.575]  I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this.
[00:03:08.895 --> 00:03:15.098]  Those few bad actors will be identified and the Tampa Police Department will handle it.
[00:03:15.238 --> 00:03:18.760]  We're watching you and we are going to take decisive action.
[00:03:22.304 --> 00:03:24.005]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:03:24.445 --> 00:03:27.327]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:03:27.968 --> 00:03:31.090]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.
[00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.193]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here, minute by minute.
[00:03:36.574 --> 00:03:39.376]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[00:03:39.476 --> 00:03:42.738]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[00:03:42.798 --> 00:03:45.760]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.762]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[00:03:51.112 --> 00:04:01.697]  Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, everything that's in the other documents.
[00:04:01.757 --> 00:04:14.403]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and force vaccines and the hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[00:04:16.804 --> 00:04:18.665]  You're not going to be able to go to the ballgames anymore.
[00:04:20.663 --> 00:04:22.987]  You're not gonna be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:04:23.007 --> 00:04:26.132]  You're not gonna be able to just, you know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:04:26.152 --> 00:04:27.394]  It's scary.
[00:04:30.678 --> 00:04:36.764]  One thing the NFL really plans to do this year is take as many precautions as possible just to keep everybody safe.
[00:04:36.804 --> 00:04:43.071]  And that starts with the vast majority of teams deciding already that there will be no fans at all allowed inside the stadium for the games.
[00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:53.221]  And every single player in the league has been given a smart tag tracking device to help them keep their distance off the field and for contact tracing should it become necessary.
[00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:55.563]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anyway.
[00:04:56.184 --> 00:04:59.667]  Players are not excited about this kind of idea of no fans.
[00:05:00.288 --> 00:05:02.010]  Yes, but they may have to get used to it.
[00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.314]  But all around the country there will be empty stadiums and masks on the sidelines.
[00:05:06.535 --> 00:05:08.316]  No fans will be allowed in.
[00:05:08.477 --> 00:05:13.942]  I can't imagine Howie playing in the NFL this day and time with no fans there.
[00:05:13.962 --> 00:05:16.265]  I honestly can't even conceive that.
[00:05:16.485 --> 00:05:18.805]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:05:18.825 --> 00:05:21.946]  You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:23.306]  Don't get the vaccine?
[00:05:23.986 --> 00:05:25.407]  You can't go to the supermarket.
[00:05:25.687 --> 00:05:26.487]  Don't have the vaccine?
[00:05:26.507 --> 00:05:27.867]  You can't go to the ballgame.
[00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:29.227]  Don't have the vaccine?
[00:05:29.847 --> 00:05:30.488]  Can't go to work.
[00:05:32.928 --> 00:05:38.509]  Because everybody in the establishment will still kind of halfway listen now and go, well he's been right about everything else, maybe we should look into this.
[00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.970]  Look, you'll believe it if they release it.
[00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.090]  So just remember this transmission then.
[00:05:45.293 --> 00:05:51.719]  The Orange County Coroner's Office is investigating the death of a woman who passed away several days after getting her second Moderna vaccine.
[00:05:51.799 --> 00:05:57.665]  She died after suffering blood clots just over a week after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine.
[00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:02.309]  Her 58-year-old mother died less than an hour after receiving the Pfizer vaccine.
[00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:03.951]  My little sister just died.
[00:06:05.237 --> 00:06:06.197]  Her first dose!
[00:06:06.557 --> 00:06:12.339]  And in Orange County, an x-ray technician has died after getting his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.
[00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.281]  His dad died four days after getting his second shot of Pfizer vaccine.
[00:06:16.661 --> 00:06:19.882]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion.
[00:06:20.342 --> 00:06:24.483]  I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion.
[00:06:25.624 --> 00:06:29.785]  I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion.
[00:06:31.025 --> 00:06:32.826]  You really need to get vaccinated.
[00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:37.550]  Don't resist when they release the bioweapon.
[00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.390]  Submit and die with pleasure!
[00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:45.232]  InfoWars.
[00:06:45.592 --> 00:06:47.192]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:06:47.212 --> 00:06:52.894]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:52.774 --> 00:06:54.774]  You are the resistance.
[00:06:54.774 --> 00:07:02.774]  It is Tuesday, August 29th, 2023.
[00:07:02.774 --> 00:07:05.774]  And I'm your host, Alex Chia.
[00:07:05.412 --> 00:07:07.433]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:10.136]  I'm hosting all four hours today.
[00:07:10.156 --> 00:07:12.678]  We have so many big guests joining us.
[00:07:12.698 --> 00:07:24.007]  We have eyewitness reporters that have been getting the nightmare bombshell footage of the downed power lines and the cover-up that's going on and the water being turned off.
[00:07:24.427 --> 00:07:27.230]  And eyewitnesses that the police now confirm are telling the truth.
[00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:35.637]  That both ends of the town, only one exit, one entrance, were blocked under orders from the police chief and the emergency managers.
[00:07:37.558 --> 00:07:42.723]  They're going to be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:07:42.863 --> 00:07:52.110]  Eric West, a well-known developer and real estate agent, and a very respected community, and of course, Fish, another well-known, respected person in the community.
[00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.673]  They're going to be joining us coming up next hour.
[00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:58.915]  Stu Peters is going to be joining us as well.
[00:08:00.016 --> 00:08:02.739]  And then in the fourth hour, Dr. Stella Emanuel.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:10.368]  Now, that said, let me just say something about yesterday's show.
[00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:14.173]  I got a little mad and walked off the show the last 30 minutes of the show.
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:15.821]  That's not an act.
[00:08:16.201 --> 00:08:22.846]  Anybody that's watched the show for decades knows occasionally I get so mad just about things in general that I can't do the show.
[00:08:23.587 --> 00:08:29.091]  Or I'm gonna yell and scream and do all those things that go viral but they're not good for me and it's not good for people in general.
[00:08:29.111 --> 00:08:32.995]  It may be entertaining but that's why you don't get the big blow-ups really ever on air anymore.
[00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:36.157]  Or nothing like they used to be because I leave.
[00:08:37.358 --> 00:08:40.060]  And I am fundamentally upset about the world just like you are.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.762]  I am so pissed about what's going on.
[00:08:43.198 --> 00:08:46.200]  And I love the audience, I love the crew, I love everybody.
[00:08:47.681 --> 00:08:51.182]  And that just happens occasionally, and I get up here and start threatening to leave or quit.
[00:08:52.003 --> 00:08:55.825]  That's something that's always in my mind, but something I can't ever physically do.
[00:08:57.026 --> 00:09:02.368]  So maybe one one-thousandth of the time, I want to quit.
[00:09:02.388 --> 00:09:06.671]  99% of the time, I don't want to, but I wear my heart on my sleeve.
[00:09:07.431 --> 00:09:12.234]  When I get upset, when I get angry, when I start going into a rage, I just say what I'm thinking.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.341]  And that's what I was thinking.
[00:09:16.721 --> 00:09:28.745]  I did cogently when I was getting remarried seven years ago, in Hawaii of all places, with my second wife, who soon to be was pregnant with my fourth child.
[00:09:28.785 --> 00:09:32.186]  My daughter is now almost seven or six and a half.
[00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:35.967]  She wasn't pressuring me to quit or cut back.
[00:09:37.026 --> 00:09:39.428]  I said, hey, I work, as you know, 15 hours a day.
[00:09:39.448 --> 00:09:41.049]  I never take off back then, especially.
[00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:45.213]  And I said, I'd really like to keep him forwards going with other hosts that host the show.
[00:09:45.893 --> 00:09:57.463]  I like to do special reports a few times a week, write books, make films, and really come in with well thought out mini documentaries and things like I've done in the past that are really the most effective.
[00:09:58.463 --> 00:10:06.222]   And that after at that point doing like 24 years, 23 years on air, now it's 29, that
[00:10:06.222 --> 00:10:13.103]  I really wanted to make that transition.
[00:10:13.347 --> 00:10:31.800]  And I hate to let our enemies govern what I do, but they do, because the world's just in too much trouble for me to try to shift into more of a analysis guru type guy that just sits back and puts out the Jordan Peterson broad brushes.
[00:10:32.981 --> 00:10:36.884]  I've got to stay as a general in the information war, right in the thick of the battle.
[00:10:36.964 --> 00:10:38.245]  That's my lot in life.
[00:10:39.438 --> 00:10:47.426]  And the fact that my enemies really want to get me off air and really want to silence me, and know how important our role is, lets me know that it's my responsibility.
[00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:52.490]  And so instead of cutting back, as you've seen, I started a new show weekly with Crowder.
[00:10:52.991 --> 00:10:55.373]  We'll be starting shows about three days a week very soon.
[00:10:55.393 --> 00:11:04.481]  And we're doing more special reports again, and I'm writing books, and we're going into development on films, and I'm going in a lot of other shows.
[00:11:05.402 --> 00:11:16.972]  I can always open up the company email and have 50 interview requests a day, and for years I just politely declined almost all of them just because it's too exhausting.
[00:11:17.012 --> 00:11:25.399]  But now I'm doing interviews every day, some days three or four times a day, and I just want my enemies to know that you did this.
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:41.952]   And that's how the Lord works, is because I'm not going to be allowed to Like at the end of The Patriot, Mel Gibson is a composite of three true stories, composite of historical fiction.
[00:11:43.172 --> 00:11:48.095]  I'm comparing myself to him, a fictional composite of real characters, Swamp Fox and others.
[00:11:48.855 --> 00:11:56.038]  But it really just does come down to that is it's duty and I'm going to continue on and most days I want to be here.
[00:11:57.419 --> 00:11:59.580]  Sometimes I do want to forget this all exists.
[00:12:01.184 --> 00:12:07.367]  On one end, you've got us that are totally committed to fighting, and you the hardcore listeners and viewers and activists who I salute.
[00:12:07.828 --> 00:12:12.490]  On the other end, you've got people that still are in La La Land and have no idea what's going on.
[00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:19.034]  And the globalists count on keeping all of them in the dark so they're not aware of what's going on.
[00:12:19.074 --> 00:12:19.914]  It's really that simple.
[00:12:20.555 --> 00:12:24.897]  And so, we can go try to disengage the New World Order, but it's coming for us.
[00:12:24.997 --> 00:12:25.917]  It's not going to go away.
[00:12:26.598 --> 00:12:35.414]   And the road of sticking our head in the sand, even partially, Very quickly will bring us into a dystopic nightmare, as you can already see.
[00:12:35.754 --> 00:12:36.315]  We're entering.
[00:12:37.375 --> 00:12:41.598]  And so the cautionary tale I give you about myself is one for yourself.
[00:12:41.618 --> 00:12:46.882]  Because I would imagine a lot of you would rather we're not in this situation.
[00:12:47.623 --> 00:12:48.663]  In fact, I think all of you.
[00:12:49.364 --> 00:12:56.029]  But we talked about those that are still asleep and those of us that are awakening or coming to new levels of understanding.
[00:12:56.809 --> 00:13:17.377]   But then there is that tiny minority of people Very race, color, and creed, but they serve evil, who count on our laziness, or count on the fact that we're sick of engaging them, or count on the fact that they're so disgusting that we really don't want to get in the pit with them and fight them.
[00:13:18.177 --> 00:13:20.378]  Not out of cowardice, but just out of disgust.
[00:13:21.178 --> 00:13:28.941]  But you've got to understand, those of us that are warriors have to climb down into that pit.
[00:13:31.508 --> 00:13:40.730]  And we have to engage these people, because that pit is caving in all around itself, sucking like a black hole all of civilization into it.
[00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:51.031]  So, I was also frustrated with myself yesterday, because two and a half hours into the show, I had only hit maybe three of the stacks.
[00:13:51.292 --> 00:13:57.593]  And every one of these stacks, a bunch of them from yesterday, a bunch of them from today, is beyond amazing.
[00:13:58.313 --> 00:13:59.413]  Beyond critical.
[00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:02.968]  So we have official U.S.
[00:14:02.988 --> 00:14:05.750]  government documents on weather control to control the population.
[00:14:07.731 --> 00:14:12.594]  Going back to 1965 and up to today, easily you can spend two hours on that.
[00:14:12.654 --> 00:14:14.095]  We're going to hit it and spend 10 minutes on it.
[00:14:14.976 --> 00:14:15.796]  Give me the synopsis.
[00:14:17.537 --> 00:14:20.079]  We've got the over-the-top developments in Ukraine and Russia.
[00:14:22.581 --> 00:14:29.205]  We've got the Washington Post and New York Times and others and new articles calling for censoring the public for the greater good.
[00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:32.143]  Evil for the cause of good.
[00:14:32.263 --> 00:14:33.264]  Injustifies the means.
[00:14:34.365 --> 00:14:42.451]  We have the insane developments in the different Trump kangaroo trials that are being developed and set up.
[00:14:45.153 --> 00:14:50.477]  We have it all coming up today and so much more.
[00:14:51.538 --> 00:14:53.560]  So you will definitely want to stay with us for this.
[00:14:54.901 --> 00:15:25.618]   Now the first thing I want to hit when we come back California and New York, two captured states on each end of the country, on each coast, on the Atlantic and Pacific side, have officially rolled out new COVID protocols and mandates on their websites, and I'll show it to you, and said that indeed they're bringing back the controls.
[00:15:26.957 --> 00:15:40.106]  Now we're not spineless creatures, so we're going to be able to expose this and block this on the second go-around, but we really caught them with their pants down almost two weeks ago with the whistleblower info.
[00:15:40.886 --> 00:15:43.668]  They still went ahead with their rollout of the fear, and it's here.
[00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:52.214]  But I was sent by the whistleblower this morning a link to the California website they just updated yesterday.
[00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:57.970]  And it says the controls are back, and here they are, right there in black and white.
[00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.311]  They're going to roll them out.
[00:16:00.371 --> 00:16:02.352]  So we have that, and a lot more.
[00:16:03.052 --> 00:16:04.572]  That's just one of the stacks.
[00:16:05.532 --> 00:16:05.953]  Right here.
[00:16:06.893 --> 00:16:09.494]  When we come back, it's all on InfoWars.com.
[00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:11.914]  The tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty.
[00:16:12.394 --> 00:16:12.835]  Stay with us.
[00:16:14.195 --> 00:16:15.235]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:16:16.436 --> 00:16:18.796]  Well, so do I. And I know how to do it.
[00:16:19.897 --> 00:16:20.757]  And you know how to do it.
[00:16:21.618 --> 00:16:34.691]  And together, we're going to choose the way forward as we arrive today at the exact center of the fork in the road.
[00:16:37.834 --> 00:16:38.875]  And there's no going back.
[00:16:40.676 --> 00:16:45.201]  There's the path of resistance, or there's the path of total enslavement.
[00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:47.470]  Come on.
[00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.633]  Your ancestors were stronger than this.
[00:16:51.533 --> 00:16:52.494]  You're stronger than this.
[00:16:53.415 --> 00:17:02.484]  You can focus on the New World Order and its activities, and you can ask God to lead, guide, and direct you with discernment.
[00:17:03.725 --> 00:17:06.768]  And you do that, we're unstoppable together.
[00:17:10.265 --> 00:17:11.426]  All right, it's official.
[00:17:11.526 --> 00:17:12.087]  It's everywhere.
[00:17:12.127 --> 00:17:16.831]  They're rolling out the COVID restrictions, as my whistleblower told me two weeks ago.
[00:17:17.752 --> 00:17:21.015]  We released the info about 11 days ago, 12 days ago.
[00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:24.678]  California, New York, you name it, you should go read it for yourself.
[00:17:24.838 --> 00:17:26.079]  I didn't even pay attention to this.
[00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:26.960]  It wasn't in the news.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:33.145]  The whistleblower contacted me this morning and sent me this document I'm about to show you.
[00:17:33.205 --> 00:17:34.246]  And I went and looked.
[00:17:34.306 --> 00:17:35.487]  They updated it yesterday.
[00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:40.430]  And they said the COVID restrictions never went away, and they were about to be brought back.
[00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:44.612]  Nice double speak.
[00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.753]  And it's incredible.
[00:17:49.394 --> 00:17:50.294]  It's right there.
[00:17:50.774 --> 00:18:05.661]  And through the institutions, and the corporations, and the hospitals, and the hotels, through the colleges, through the public schools, all over the country, they are shutting down public schools if there's one COVID case.
[00:18:07.659 --> 00:18:11.001]  That's creating the lockdown by sending the children back home.
[00:18:11.381 --> 00:18:12.342]  That's the beginning of it.
[00:18:13.422 --> 00:18:16.944]  And remember what I said two Fridays ago.
[00:18:18.845 --> 00:18:30.131]  I said, my sources, because I called around and confirmed what the first source said, said middle of September, Biden is set to start the rollout.
[00:18:31.452 --> 00:18:38.224]   Now, five, six days later, It's a little longer.
[00:18:38.264 --> 00:18:41.368]  It was last Tuesday, so about eight days ago.
[00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:44.171]  Seven days ago.
[00:18:45.272 --> 00:18:46.174]  They said, you know what?
[00:18:46.214 --> 00:18:52.201]  We're going to have a new shot that just happens to be ready for the new variant on the 15th of September.
[00:18:52.641 --> 00:18:54.163]  Now, what did I say they were told?
[00:18:54.963 --> 00:18:57.304]  The beginning of the announcements begin September 15th.
[00:18:57.944 --> 00:19:05.028]  This was just the warming up and getting ready that just so happened to begin right after I announced it literally six hours later.
[00:19:05.468 --> 00:19:05.808]  Everywhere.
[00:19:05.988 --> 00:19:12.331]  They just opened up on the public, every controlled corporate outlet, and then the institutions to create the fear.
[00:19:14.952 --> 00:19:18.174]  And now you go to the grocery store here in Austin, a third of the people are wearing masks.
[00:19:18.734 --> 00:19:23.116]  Two weeks ago, you might be in there and there'd be 150 people, you might see two masks.
[00:19:24.861 --> 00:19:25.961]  Now you go everywhere.
[00:19:26.762 --> 00:19:27.462]  That's where I live.
[00:19:27.762 --> 00:19:29.083]  We're getting reports the same thing everywhere.
[00:19:29.363 --> 00:19:30.443]  And the articles are coming out.
[00:19:30.643 --> 00:19:33.465]  Oh, last week it was just a few hospitals in New York.
[00:19:33.745 --> 00:19:35.045]  Now it's most of them.
[00:19:35.666 --> 00:19:36.666]  It was a few nursing homes.
[00:19:36.706 --> 00:19:37.666]  Now it's all of them.
[00:19:38.087 --> 00:19:40.007]  And the same thing spreading all over the country.
[00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:41.468]  From the west and east coast.
[00:19:41.948 --> 00:19:42.448]  Towards the middle.
[00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.650]  So.
[00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.511]  They've attacked the August 18th episode.
[00:19:50.612 --> 00:19:55.936]   Saying, oh, it's disinformation because they don't want you to Develop your own opinion now and say no.
[00:19:55.976 --> 00:19:57.778]  They want to just slip it in before you say no.
[00:19:58.459 --> 00:20:03.085]  So here's some excerpts of myself, not last Friday, but the Friday before last.
[00:20:03.666 --> 00:20:09.034]  And then a clip of the press secretary yesterday afternoon announcing the quote new booster.
[00:20:10.455 --> 00:20:24.099]  Whistleblowers from TSA and Border Patrol have raised the alarm to InfoWars that the Biden administration is setting the stage for full cupboard lockdowns that will begin with incremental restrictions like masking TSA employees in mid-September.
[00:20:24.259 --> 00:20:30.941]  The Biden administration is setting the stage for full cupboard lockdowns that will begin with incremental restrictions in mid-September.
[00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:32.241]  Two weeks later...
[00:20:32.561 --> 00:20:36.683]  FDA and CDC, they've made an announcement on the new vaccine.
[00:20:37.063 --> 00:20:43.265]  So certainly they said that they will have an, there'll be an updated vaccine in September, mid-September.
[00:20:43.285 --> 00:20:50.167]  The Biden administration is setting the stage for full covered lockdowns that will begin with incremental restrictions in mid-September.
[00:20:50.507 --> 00:20:53.428]  There'll be an updated vaccine in September, mid-September.
[00:20:53.448 --> 00:20:55.669]  So are we going to sit here and take this?
[00:20:55.869 --> 00:20:57.330]  Are we going to sit here and wait out of this?
[00:20:58.482 --> 00:21:06.569]  And let them put the narrative out and use the fear-mongering and then it's the concerts and then it's the grocery stores and then it's the fear and all the same thing.
[00:21:06.589 --> 00:21:08.611]  Are we gonna go through Groundhog Day again?
[00:21:09.752 --> 00:21:10.893]  We'll work hard to expose it.
[00:21:10.913 --> 00:21:11.813]  It'll get us ahead of it.
[00:21:12.614 --> 00:21:16.738]  But I got a sneaking suspicion we'll be sitting here very soon going Alex Jones is right again.
[00:21:17.518 --> 00:21:19.400]  Let's not fail this time folks!
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.321]  Please!
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.820]  Please!
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:35.300]   Now, let's play the full clip of the press secretary yesterday afternoon, 11, 12 days
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:43.940]   after we broke it, saying September 15th, in the full hour I did, I said September 15th,
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.620]  that's what I was told.
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:54.619]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:21:45.673 --> 00:21:46.594]  I said it like 10 times.
[00:21:47.234 --> 00:21:53.256]  He said, we'll be getting the guidelines the next week, but then by September 15th they announced it.
[00:21:54.841 --> 00:21:56.222]  Well, now the guidelines are out.
[00:21:57.002 --> 00:21:58.063]  Just like he told me.
[00:22:01.204 --> 00:22:01.644]  Here she is.
[00:22:02.985 --> 00:22:09.488]  The president said in Tahoe that he had tentatively decided to recommend everyone get the new vaccine.
[00:22:09.568 --> 00:22:11.469]  When is he going to decide finally?
[00:22:11.489 --> 00:22:14.811]  So, I think you've heard from the FDA and CDC.
[00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:17.693]  They've made an announcement on the new vaccine.
[00:22:18.053 --> 00:22:24.216]  So, certainly, they said that they will have an updated vaccine in September, mid-September.
[00:22:24.856 --> 00:22:25.577]  I believe so.
[00:22:26.037 --> 00:22:38.967]  We know that, as you all know, vaccinations against COVID-19 remains the safest protection for avoiding hospitalization, long-term health outcomes, and death, which is why we are going to be encouraging Americans to stay up-to-date on their vaccines.
[00:22:40.508 --> 00:22:41.810]  And she says it's the 15th.
[00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:46.994]  So, our whistleblower nailed it because they were getting the direct info.
[00:22:47.014 --> 00:22:47.994]  Of course they nailed it.
[00:22:48.134 --> 00:22:51.037]  It's not hard to nail it when you're just telling the truth.
[00:22:52.244 --> 00:22:52.984]  Totally nailed it.
[00:22:53.304 --> 00:22:53.685]  Nailed it.
[00:22:55.325 --> 00:22:55.665]  Nailed it.
[00:22:55.966 --> 00:22:56.306]  Nailed it.
[00:22:57.026 --> 00:22:58.246]  Not just, oh, it's a whistleblower.
[00:22:58.547 --> 00:22:59.567]  Naming the day.
[00:23:02.368 --> 00:23:04.549]  Over a week and a half before they said it themselves.
[00:23:05.209 --> 00:23:07.730]  That's called nailing it.
[00:23:10.251 --> 00:23:16.614]  That's like Michael Jordan flying 30 feet in the air and dunking and breaking the rim.
[00:23:19.107 --> 00:23:20.248]  That's what we did together.
[00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:22.510]  And they are freaked out.
[00:23:23.831 --> 00:23:25.292]  They are super pissed right now.
[00:23:26.973 --> 00:23:27.194]  So.
[00:23:28.695 --> 00:23:30.596]  We're not getting caught with our pants down this time.
[00:23:30.636 --> 00:23:32.117]  They've been caught with their pants down.
[00:23:32.478 --> 00:23:33.439]  But they can't help it.
[00:23:33.479 --> 00:23:34.399]  They're still rolling ahead.
[00:23:37.422 --> 00:23:38.983]  But did you catch what she said there?
[00:23:40.444 --> 00:23:41.185]  She reads the notes.
[00:23:41.665 --> 00:23:43.427]  Whatever the question is, she flips the page and reads it.
[00:23:43.467 --> 00:23:44.327]  Okay, the 15th.
[00:23:44.928 --> 00:23:45.728]  It'll protect you.
[00:23:45.989 --> 00:23:46.809]  It's hospitalization.
[00:23:46.989 --> 00:23:48.150]  You know, spreading and getting sick.
[00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:48.391]  Whatever.
[00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:50.411]  Shame old lies.
[00:23:51.512 --> 00:23:52.713]  They always tell.
[00:23:52.733 --> 00:23:58.316]  And sometimes you'll watch a football game and the coach just keeps running up the middle of the same play.
[00:23:59.417 --> 00:24:04.741]  Or they go, you know, out for a far pass or whatever.
[00:24:05.161 --> 00:24:07.303]  And they just run the same play over and over again.
[00:24:07.583 --> 00:24:13.187]  And they just run the same play, same play, the same play, the same play, the same play, the same play.
[00:24:14.775 --> 00:24:21.319]  All right, I'm going to come back and drill through all this when we return because it's wild and it's on.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.241]  But you've got to go to Infowars.com and read the article.
[00:24:24.622 --> 00:24:26.723]  You've got to link through to the California site.
[00:24:26.763 --> 00:24:27.904]  We're going to link to New York as well.
[00:24:27.924 --> 00:24:30.325]  I forgot to tell the writers about that.
[00:24:31.006 --> 00:24:32.967]  And it's announcing it all right here.
[00:24:33.608 --> 00:24:37.010]  Most populous state, teeing you up for the same garbage.
[00:24:38.251 --> 00:24:44.702]   You know, a lot of people think that rock and rollers party, but I can tell you, ZZ Top.
[00:24:45.883 --> 00:24:46.263]  Parties.
[00:24:46.863 --> 00:24:47.824]  Little Bird told me once.
[00:24:48.824 --> 00:24:54.326]  Part of the crazy things I've seen in this wild 29 years on air.
[00:24:54.346 --> 00:24:54.406]  Woo!
[00:24:55.947 --> 00:24:56.788]  Diamond ring.
[00:24:58.028 --> 00:25:00.369]  I ain't missing not a single thing.
[00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:02.810]  Cuff links.
[00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:04.631]  Stick pin.
[00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:13.756]  Alright, let me get into the big news on their attempts to bring back all the COVID restrictions to be eased into the next election for mail-in ballots in a moment.
[00:25:14.276 --> 00:25:14.976]  But first off...
[00:25:15.856 --> 00:25:23.918]  I'm very extremely excited to announce, sold out for 6, 7, 8 months, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, the strongest cucuminoid out there.
[00:25:24.398 --> 00:25:25.878]  Most turmeric is 5%.
[00:25:25.958 --> 00:25:27.059]  Does a great thing for you.
[00:25:27.519 --> 00:25:29.539]  Even if you buy bags of it, that's what curry is.
[00:25:29.859 --> 00:25:30.459]  Tastes great.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.680]  I'm addicted to it.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.520]  But that's at 4 or 5%.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.480]  That's what raw turmeric is.
[00:25:35.181 --> 00:25:43.022]  This is 95% cucuminoid, all naturally compounded, the strongest on the market, period.
[00:25:43.342 --> 00:25:44.043]  The leading competitor is 75%.
[00:25:45.708 --> 00:25:52.010]  We went to a top manufacturer years ago, and we said, how much more does it cost to go the strongest you can do it?
[00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:53.191]  They said, we'll get back with you.
[00:25:53.491 --> 00:25:54.731]  They said, we can go 95.
[00:25:56.232 --> 00:25:57.252]  That's the strongest you can do.
[00:25:58.873 --> 00:26:01.033]  Unless you use chemicals to concentrate it, and we didn't want that.
[00:26:01.854 --> 00:26:02.454]  We said, do it.
[00:26:02.474 --> 00:26:06.675]  It costs like $3 more a bottle for us, on top of the price it already was.
[00:26:07.216 --> 00:26:07.976]  Strongest you're going to get.
[00:26:09.119 --> 00:26:40.161]   Anti-inflammatory immune system flexibility support joint support beyond that it is rocket fuel it is amazing I'm so glad it's back because I ran out of my supply and I took a bunch of it this week and my Achilles pain and my knee pain is gone because this right leg has been through an Achilles blown leg broken compound fracture I mean this this this right leg has been through hell and back I'm not gonna mention half the other injuries but pain-free right now ladies and gentlemen I remember about four years ago, my wife had really bad sciatica.
[00:26:40.181 --> 00:26:41.161]  She's playing so much tennis.
[00:26:41.962 --> 00:26:43.042]  She's also a yoga instructor.
[00:26:44.063 --> 00:26:47.264]  And it looks like a Greek statue with the clothes off.
[00:26:47.504 --> 00:26:49.185]  And I said, but she's in perfect shape.
[00:26:49.585 --> 00:26:50.265]  It's ridiculous.
[00:26:50.305 --> 00:26:51.406]  It's like a 20-year-old gymnast.
[00:26:52.266 --> 00:26:54.587]  And she said, I got these horse pill tumerics.
[00:26:54.627 --> 00:26:55.707]  And you're saying that's going to help me.
[00:26:55.727 --> 00:26:56.468]  These barely help.
[00:26:56.868 --> 00:26:57.848]  I got to take three of them.
[00:26:58.168 --> 00:26:59.969]  And each pill is three times stronger than yours.
[00:26:59.989 --> 00:27:04.911]  And I said, that's because under FDA, you've got to just say it is a raw tumeric value.
[00:27:06.869 --> 00:27:12.473]  You're not allowed to, you say it's a quote, you know, concentrate technically the way the rules work, you just got to call it tumoring.
[00:27:13.154 --> 00:27:14.035]  She said, okay, let me try it.
[00:27:14.075 --> 00:27:14.995]  She said, it's incredible.
[00:27:15.636 --> 00:27:17.558]  It got rid of 90% of my sciatica.
[00:27:18.438 --> 00:27:22.922]  Whereas I had to take three or four of this other one, I take one or two of these, boom, it's almost gone.
[00:27:23.202 --> 00:27:24.583]  Not totally gone, almost gone.
[00:27:27.085 --> 00:27:33.070]  A lot of stretching and other things she's able to get rid of it, but she plays tennis sometimes two hours a day and hopping around on the concrete.
[00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:33.831]  You know, it does that.
[00:27:34.631 --> 00:27:37.832]  So, she's very good, one of the best players in Austin, but that's a side issue.
[00:27:38.853 --> 00:27:40.013]  This, she loves.
[00:27:40.154 --> 00:27:41.294]  This, she's religious about.
[00:27:41.674 --> 00:27:42.555]  It ran out a few months ago.
[00:27:42.595 --> 00:27:43.195]  She's, where is it?
[00:27:43.255 --> 00:27:43.795]  I said, it's gone.
[00:27:44.015 --> 00:27:45.056]  Well, I know you got some around the office.
[00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:45.516]  Bring it to me.
[00:27:45.736 --> 00:27:46.096]  We didn't.
[00:27:46.116 --> 00:27:48.537]  Because any loose bottles of this disappear.
[00:27:49.178 --> 00:27:51.479]  Infowarstore.com, it is back.
[00:27:51.999 --> 00:28:10.944]   Joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, turmeric root extract, 95% cuminoid, Boswala, Socrata extract, organic, Spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme leaf, pepper dine, concentrated black pepper for better upload.
[00:28:12.244 --> 00:28:14.865]  It's back 25% off infowarestore.com.
[00:28:15.825 --> 00:28:25.348]  And despite the fact we're going to sell out of X3, the limited supply we got, the best iodine out there, and Vitamin Refusion, we're keeping both up at the flash sale until they're gone.
[00:28:26.701 --> 00:28:35.305]  And that is less than one week, and it'll be 10 weeks until Survival Shield X3 comes back in, and about a month until more Vitamin Mineral Fusion comes in.
[00:28:35.826 --> 00:28:39.968]  But we're still discounting because I want you to try it, I want you to experience it, and we need the funds right now.
[00:28:40.608 --> 00:28:45.871]  The flash sale for Vitamin Mineral Fusion and X3 is live right now.
[00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.891]  Take advantage of it.
[00:28:47.991 --> 00:28:50.913]  Separately, we have three limited edition shirts.
[00:28:51.154 --> 00:28:52.315]  One of them, hardly any left.
[00:28:52.955 --> 00:28:53.756]  It's our mugshot.
[00:28:53.776 --> 00:28:57.920]  When they didn't do the mugshot in New York a few months ago, we made our own mugshot saying political prisoner.
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.302]  There's like 500 shirts left of that.
[00:29:00.943 --> 00:29:01.763]  When it's gone, it's gone.
[00:29:01.783 --> 00:29:02.884]  It's like Alex Jones for president.
[00:29:03.285 --> 00:29:04.566]  Limited edition, no longer available.
[00:29:04.826 --> 00:29:06.688]  Even though people liked it, I said these are all limited edition.
[00:29:07.918 --> 00:29:09.118]  Shirt's going forward, limited edition.
[00:29:09.359 --> 00:29:10.619]  We run them for a few months, that's it.
[00:29:11.319 --> 00:29:18.182]  But we have the two new, real mugshot ones that say, Never Surrender on the back, Infowars.com on the front, Political Prisoner.
[00:29:18.662 --> 00:29:21.263]  We'll support the broadcast, support President Trump and get them.
[00:29:21.683 --> 00:29:22.763]  Those are being printed right now.
[00:29:22.823 --> 00:29:23.784]  They come next week.
[00:29:24.064 --> 00:29:27.845]  So get your order in now and they'll be shipped out to you as soon as they arrive.
[00:29:27.865 --> 00:29:30.026]  You got Trump, 2024 on the front.
[00:29:31.046 --> 00:29:32.707]  On the back, Never Surrender.
[00:29:32.767 --> 00:29:35.888]  And then the other shirt says, Political Prisoner.
[00:29:36.698 --> 00:29:44.100]  There's also a gold version as well that's pretty gaudy but definitely matches with the golden toad, El Trumpo.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.440]  So those are all available.
[00:29:47.401 --> 00:29:49.181]  The shirt that's selling out is discounted $17.76.
[00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:52.102]  The others are limited edition as well.
[00:29:52.762 --> 00:29:53.542]  Fundraiser shirts.
[00:29:54.442 --> 00:29:54.723]  Okay.
[00:29:55.983 --> 00:29:58.704]  Let's dive in and get done with the big COVID news.
[00:29:59.624 --> 00:30:02.525]  It's so important because we know we can do something about this.
[00:30:03.005 --> 00:30:13.483]   We know we've already We're in like round two in a Muhammad Ali fight and we're fighting George Foreman and this is hypothetical.
[00:30:14.363 --> 00:30:15.964]  George Foreman was a tank and this never happened.
[00:30:16.524 --> 00:30:40.371]   Muhammad Ali did knock him down sometimes later and did win later in the fights but this is like we've already been in a competition already been in a match years ago with George Foreman and he barely beats us and now we got the rematch And we came out, ladies and gentlemen, and literally knocked his ass down in the first round.
[00:30:43.513 --> 00:30:44.914]  That was getting the jump on him.
[00:30:48.095 --> 00:30:52.618]  And he laid on the mat till the nine count and barely got back up.
[00:30:54.159 --> 00:30:59.662]  So if we come in on the globalists, this is an allegory, I don't mean actual violence, it's a parable, an analogy.
[00:31:00.967 --> 00:31:04.450]  I know you know that, listeners, but the media will say something other, so I have to do the proviso.
[00:31:06.832 --> 00:31:09.514]  After the little asterisk at the end.
[00:31:10.195 --> 00:31:11.897]  We don't mean real violence, it's an allegory.
[00:31:12.317 --> 00:31:13.598]  It's a parable, as I just said.
[00:31:17.461 --> 00:31:22.486]  Do we let him, now that he's got back up, get his wits about him?
[00:31:23.366 --> 00:31:24.848]  Or do we go ahead and just finish the fight right now?
[00:31:25.987 --> 00:31:43.995]  And that means you share the articles, you share the videos, you call Congress, you call talk radio, you cut your own videos, you comment on videos, you make the biggest buzz you can, you go speak at city council, you go speak at county commission, you go speak at the state house peacefully, and you say they lied about the mask, they lied about the origin of the...
[00:31:45.255 --> 00:31:47.095]  They lied about the injections.
[00:31:47.896 --> 00:31:48.696]  They hurt our children.
[00:31:48.716 --> 00:31:49.756]  They caused mass suicide.
[00:31:50.036 --> 00:31:53.076]  They collapsed the third world and killed over 80 million people with starvation.
[00:31:53.296 --> 00:31:54.857]  The UN's got their big UN treaty.
[00:31:55.037 --> 00:31:58.437]  They want to ram through with a new hysteria, and they're trying it right now.
[00:31:58.877 --> 00:32:00.698]  Let's not go along with this.
[00:32:01.138 --> 00:32:03.578]  Let's say no collectively together.
[00:32:04.458 --> 00:32:14.140]  Because George Foreman, they're going, one, two, three, and... George Foreman's starting to get back up.
[00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:21.879]  And I know, really, when they box, they only do it up to, like, they go all the way to ten, I forget.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.682]  The point is, is that George Foreman's getting back up.
[00:32:25.702 --> 00:32:33.669]  And I hate to compare the great Christian pastor, amazing person, probably the best boxer ever when it comes to being a good person, also one of the best boxers ever.
[00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:37.232]  It's wrong to describe George Foreman as the new world order.
[00:32:37.473 --> 00:32:41.997]  In fact, I just kind of spit these analogies out, and now in hindsight, I want to apologize to fellow Texan.
[00:32:42.797 --> 00:32:43.557]  George Foreman.
[00:32:44.258 --> 00:32:45.778]  I'm not trying to compare him to the new world order.
[00:32:46.058 --> 00:32:46.738]  I apologize.
[00:32:47.098 --> 00:32:49.319]  But I mean, I'm talking about a formidable opponent.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.020]  I think the American people are the best there is, so I'll call us Muhammad Ali.
[00:32:55.301 --> 00:32:57.082]  And he's getting up.
[00:32:59.563 --> 00:33:00.643]  Anybody knows about George Foreman?
[00:33:00.663 --> 00:33:04.304]  You knock his ass down, when he gets back up, he's coming with everything he's got.
[00:33:06.685 --> 00:33:09.666]  So, let's not sit here and get all excited.
[00:33:11.061 --> 00:33:15.324]  About how much success we just had that we knocked George Foreman down.
[00:33:15.344 --> 00:33:19.446]  Because he's getting back up right now.
[00:33:21.568 --> 00:33:24.250]  Now I'm done with the analogy, so let's plow through the news right now.
[00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:32.595]  And again, I could spend the whole show on just the California new COVID guidelines they put out that the TSA told us was going to be coming out in the next few weeks.
[00:33:33.435 --> 00:33:33.836]  Here it is.
[00:33:34.196 --> 00:33:39.099]  California is the bellwether, the test site for all of it.
[00:33:39.159 --> 00:33:40.220]  The test balloon site.
[00:33:42.378 --> 00:33:43.238]  Alex Jones is right.
[00:33:43.698 --> 00:33:46.139]  California launched this COVID guidelines page.
[00:33:46.499 --> 00:33:48.839]  Warns COVID-19 has never gone away.
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.360]  And it goes in to say, take all your shots.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.061]  Have your vaccine passport with you to travel, to get into businesses.
[00:33:58.021 --> 00:34:00.202]  Don't go to work if you think you're sick.
[00:34:01.062 --> 00:34:05.303]  Again, wear your mask everywhere.
[00:34:09.898 --> 00:34:14.401]  And it goes on to say, the mask protects you, and all these lies.
[00:34:15.661 --> 00:34:21.645]  Lockdown 2.0, fact checkers say COVID mandate are not being rolled out as they are being rolled out.
[00:34:23.246 --> 00:34:24.646]  Very important report.
[00:34:25.187 --> 00:34:27.328]  You saw the White House Press Secretary say it as well.
[00:34:29.155 --> 00:34:37.982]  Of course, the Democrats continue the proud tradition of wearing white masks to show their political affiliation, like they did at the end of the Civil War, and like to do now.
[00:34:38.002 --> 00:34:41.005]  There's the KKK, and now the KKK 2.0.
[00:34:42.426 --> 00:34:49.572]  Here is the actual current safety measures, as you can see on screen of your TV viewer, COVID19.ca.gov.
[00:34:49.592 --> 00:34:49.952]  See that?
[00:34:49.792 --> 00:34:55.511]  See that?
[00:34:55.511 --> 00:34:57.192]  Right there.
[00:34:57.192 --> 00:34:58.592]  And I suggest you go read it.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:04.263]  It's only 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 pages long.
[00:35:05.884 --> 00:35:06.845]  And it's all right there.
[00:35:07.926 --> 00:35:09.006]  It says it never ended.
[00:35:09.587 --> 00:35:10.687]  And now we're bringing it back.
[00:35:11.688 --> 00:35:16.111]  And that we've got our smart plan and the past restrictions that they say are coming back.
[00:35:16.631 --> 00:35:17.351]  What to do.
[00:35:18.572 --> 00:35:20.113]  And it is the original plan.
[00:35:20.473 --> 00:35:21.614]  Quarantine and isolation.
[00:35:21.474 --> 00:35:24.673]  Digital vaccine record.
[00:35:24.673 --> 00:35:29.074]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:35:29.074 --> 00:35:32.713]  Education and childcare, putting the mask back on the kids.
[00:35:32.713 --> 00:35:34.713]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:35:34.953 --> 00:35:38.675]  Masking, vaccinations and testing at the schools, all back.
[00:35:40.436 --> 00:35:44.459]  Workplace safety, maskings, all of it, all the same policies, back.
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:50.723]  Wear a mask to keep from spreading the virus to those who are vulnerable, even though it doesn't.
[00:35:51.083 --> 00:35:55.126]  This includes those with the immune systems, those who are pregnant, and they are vaccinated.
[00:35:56.747 --> 00:35:57.848]  So we put a check on that.
[00:35:59.332 --> 00:35:59.712]  Travel.
[00:35:59.752 --> 00:36:03.454]  Keep California healthy and our communities open by following CDC travel guidelines.
[00:36:03.474 --> 00:36:05.635]  Remember, do what we say and we'll stop the spread.
[00:36:06.095 --> 00:36:06.896]  Do's and don'ts.
[00:36:07.536 --> 00:36:11.518]  Protect yourself and others by keeping these common safety steps in mind.
[00:36:12.499 --> 00:36:13.359]  Get your shots.
[00:36:13.899 --> 00:36:14.760]  Wear your mask.
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:16.301]  On and on and on.
[00:36:16.821 --> 00:36:17.621]  Get tested.
[00:36:21.823 --> 00:36:24.024]  Do not lose your proof of vaccination.
[00:36:24.445 --> 00:36:24.985]  You'll need it.
[00:36:26.957 --> 00:36:28.058]  Gathering safely.
[00:36:28.078 --> 00:36:30.419]  Basically the exact same policies.
[00:36:31.219 --> 00:36:32.140]  It's a huge section.
[00:36:34.881 --> 00:36:35.941]  The smarter plan.
[00:36:36.642 --> 00:36:38.063]  Do what we did last time.
[00:36:39.423 --> 00:36:41.664]  How our experiences last time inform our future.
[00:36:42.265 --> 00:36:43.505]  How we're preparing for the future.
[00:36:43.845 --> 00:36:46.707]  The last time we know you lied to us it was all a giant fraud.
[00:36:46.987 --> 00:36:50.008]  Caused depression, death, destruction of the economy, collapse of the third world.
[00:36:50.209 --> 00:36:51.749]  But they say that's the plan.
[00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:54.811]  COVID-19 disease control and prevention.
[00:36:56.226 --> 00:36:57.046]  And it goes through it all.
[00:36:57.427 --> 00:36:57.867]  Okay.
[00:36:59.007 --> 00:37:01.929]  So, they're rolling it back out again.
[00:37:01.969 --> 00:37:06.451]  But remember, the illegal aliens were all exempt from the shots because the U.N.
[00:37:06.511 --> 00:37:11.173]  said they wouldn't sign on the liability protection that the Western governments signed on to.
[00:37:16.075 --> 00:37:27.201]  Just remember, they didn't give an F about masks, vaccines, or lockdowns while they were importing massive amounts of migrants into the country without your consent.
[00:37:29.902 --> 00:37:34.064]  Oh, but conspiracy theorists spread false information about the return of COVID.
[00:37:34.485 --> 00:37:35.985]  That was last Friday.
[00:37:37.967 --> 00:37:40.768]  That didn't age too well, did it?
[00:37:42.964 --> 00:37:47.566]  UMass Memorial Reinstates Staff Mass Mandates Have Dramatic Increase In COVID Cases.
[00:37:47.726 --> 00:37:48.707]  CBS News.
[00:37:50.247 --> 00:37:54.069]  Biden Administration Eyes Mid-September For New COVID-19 Booster Shot Rollout.
[00:37:54.089 --> 00:37:55.130]  What'd I tell you weeks before?
[00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:59.152]  CDC denies COVID restrictions are coming back, but they are.
[00:38:01.152 --> 00:38:03.293]  He says it's for everybody and it works this time.
[00:38:07.055 --> 00:38:08.356]  So, that's that stack.
[00:38:09.505 --> 00:38:15.009]  I'm going to set it aside until Dr. Stella Emanuel joins us.
[00:38:17.151 --> 00:38:22.655]  And now, let's move the next stack into position.
[00:38:26.178 --> 00:38:27.399]  Let's look at cause and effect.
[00:38:30.581 --> 00:38:32.682]  I talked about this yesterday, but I didn't get to it.
[00:38:34.704 --> 00:38:37.126]  So let's get this important little stacky out of the way.
[00:38:39.488 --> 00:38:39.988]  Daily Mail.
[00:38:41.649 --> 00:38:43.249]  And they have the same numbers in the United States.
[00:38:43.549 --> 00:38:44.809]  Per capita it's much worse.
[00:38:45.649 --> 00:38:47.650]  You look at total numbers, but per capita it's around the same.
[00:38:49.851 --> 00:38:54.312]  And they're having all sorts of problems.
[00:38:56.072 --> 00:39:08.155]  At least 50, at least 500 UK flights, at least 500 UK flights cancelled by air traffic chaos as controllers input flight plans by hand.
[00:39:09.437 --> 00:39:10.617]  And that causes delays here.
[00:39:11.198 --> 00:39:19.020]  And bosses admit they have no idea when network failure could be fixed while thousands are stranded across the world.
[00:39:21.261 --> 00:39:27.462]  And we've had the same AI automated systems fail here multiple times last few years.
[00:39:28.123 --> 00:39:29.323]  We're told there's problems here now.
[00:39:30.383 --> 00:39:33.024]  Remember Southwest a few months ago got totally shut down for a couple days.
[00:39:34.024 --> 00:39:35.385]  But this is system wide in the UK.
[00:39:38.197 --> 00:39:46.901]  And they say they don't have enough trained FAA folks, in England it's called something else, to actually bring the flights in.
[00:39:46.941 --> 00:39:48.081]  They don't know how to do it anymore.
[00:39:48.822 --> 00:40:00.847]  So see how when you only have AI and only have computers that run it all, like most of the flights, take off smooth, land smooth, but it's a autopilot flying.
[00:40:02.088 --> 00:40:03.869]  And they're talking about getting rid of pilots altogether.
[00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:06.890]  They introduced legislation, only have one pilot in planes.
[00:40:09.124 --> 00:40:10.484]  Which gives the globals total control.
[00:40:12.205 --> 00:40:13.965]  And that leads us to this point.
[00:40:13.985 --> 00:40:17.766]  AI humanoid pilot might be able to solve pilot shortage.
[00:40:19.167 --> 00:40:24.388]  It's an article from Zero Hedge linked to an article from American Airlines.
[00:40:26.149 --> 00:40:28.990]  AI humanoid pilot might be able to solve the pilot shortage.
[00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:33.371]  The pilot shortage is due to heart attacks, blood clots, and myocarditis.
[00:40:33.411 --> 00:41:07.351]   So see, you hit the general public With the shots, you hit the airline pilots with the shots, they then can't pass the medical, just like you put transgenderism and critical race theory and all the rest of it in the military, and force shots, makes some good people get out, and then now the military can't function, they put an order out last month, Secretary of Defense saying if you're transgender, no need to show up for your formation or drills or even wear a uniform, you can just do whatever you want.
[00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:26.145]  Thought that was a joke from, uh, MASH, where, you know, the guy's always running out of the military, so he wants to get a Section 8 to say he's mentally ill, but, especially if you're younger, you don't know about MASH, but there's a comedy show in the 60s and 70s based around the Korean War.
[00:41:27.305 --> 00:41:33.567]  Can we play the theme song, maybe, of MASH, if we can find it?
[00:41:35.615 --> 00:41:39.217]  Now just totally destroy the force right as they convert over to robots.
[00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:41.138]  I've been telling you that for 20 years.
[00:41:41.198 --> 00:41:41.578]  Here it is.
[00:41:41.838 --> 00:41:42.379]  And here it is.
[00:41:42.899 --> 00:41:46.601]  AI brings the robot wingman to aerial combat.
[00:41:48.422 --> 00:41:50.043]  This is out of the Defense Department.
[00:41:52.064 --> 00:41:52.544]  How now?
[00:41:53.965 --> 00:41:56.646]  They're gonna have to make sure you've all got a robot wingman.
[00:41:57.086 --> 00:42:04.755]   Plus, the pilots can't Seem to be able to fly anymore because of all the heart attacks and blood clots and myocarditis.
[00:42:05.376 --> 00:42:09.458]  So they've got that all taken care of.
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:11.940]  All right.
[00:42:14.742 --> 00:42:20.066]  Let's now, because we're doing the whole next hour on Hawaii, and boy, the biggest developments yet are about to come out.
[00:42:21.307 --> 00:42:25.790]  Let's talk about how the system plans to block us as we try to wake up humanity.
[00:42:27.051 --> 00:42:41.702]   Now, I talked about this over a decade ago, and we learned about it, and then I Talked about it a lot when I was under attack by it and watched congressional hearings where they had the CIA and the Defense Department at the House Armed Services Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee that I wasn't invited to.
[00:42:41.742 --> 00:42:44.863]  And even when I went up there later for more hearings, they wouldn't let me in.
[00:42:44.883 --> 00:42:48.264]  Oh, we're just going to accuse you of being a Russian spy in here.
[00:42:48.805 --> 00:42:54.026]  You can't come in here and... Yeah, I'm a Russian spy.
[00:42:56.047 --> 00:42:56.247]  Sure.
[00:42:57.774 --> 00:42:59.456]  So, uh, here it is.
[00:42:59.516 --> 00:43:04.962]  The Washington Post calls for reducing free speech to improve democracy.
[00:43:04.982 --> 00:43:10.528]  So we gotta silence everybody that doesn't agree with us and all their past lies, or we're surrendering.
[00:43:14.847 --> 00:43:15.968]  And look how we're surrendering.
[00:43:16.408 --> 00:43:17.569]  We're surrendering to them, actually.
[00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:18.910]  There's a video of this.
[00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:26.375]  A 12-year-old student in Colorado Springs was removed from class and bitched out in front of the class for having a Gadsden flag patch on his backpack.
[00:43:26.876 --> 00:43:32.876]   That's the oldest flag, the first flag that we had at the start of the Revolutionary War, even before
[00:43:32.876 --> 00:43:43.196]   the militia leader's wife famously came up with the flag and knitted it,
[00:43:43.196 --> 00:43:46.394]  according to George Washington's specifications.
[00:43:46.684 --> 00:43:48.265]  She made the flag in less than one day.
[00:43:48.285 --> 00:43:55.350]  And, well, the school claims the flag has origins of slavery.
[00:43:55.791 --> 00:43:57.072]  Well, you could say that about the U.S.
[00:43:57.112 --> 00:43:57.953]  flag or any other flag.
[00:43:59.254 --> 00:44:00.254]  Kid just grins.
[00:44:00.294 --> 00:44:03.157]  He knows his history better than the teachers.
[00:44:07.483 --> 00:44:08.444]  Let's go ahead and roll the audio.
[00:44:08.264 --> 00:44:36.503]   here it is. You can go to Africa where slavery is still legal in six countries
[00:44:36.503 --> 00:44:38.503]  and say take down their flags.
[00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:39.281]  Or Saudi Arabia that has it going on.
[00:44:40.842 --> 00:44:41.722]  There's the U.S.
[00:44:41.742 --> 00:44:42.382]  flag right there.
[00:44:43.363 --> 00:44:45.764]  That later fought a revolution and a civil war to end slavery.
[00:44:46.264 --> 00:44:49.345]  But they've already said they want that flag too.
[00:44:49.365 --> 00:44:54.387]  And the comeback is the Gadsden flag is the oldest U.S.
[00:44:54.427 --> 00:44:55.147]  flag there is.
[00:44:56.188 --> 00:44:57.108]  Different variants of it.
[00:44:57.488 --> 00:45:02.010]  It's the colony should unite snake, don't tread on me, and then it's the first Navy flag.
[00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:03.411]  That's the Navy flag.
[00:45:04.346 --> 00:45:05.627]  The John Paul Jones flag.
[00:45:08.989 --> 00:45:12.091]  That is the oldest flag in the United States.
[00:45:13.872 --> 00:45:16.673]  That's actually what Benjamin Franklin wanted it to be, was a rattlesnake.
[00:45:18.174 --> 00:45:20.315]  Yeah, wouldn't an eagle be a rattlesnake?
[00:45:24.458 --> 00:45:27.079]  You know, you can make the joke that only the Mexicans have a snake on their flag.
[00:45:27.159 --> 00:45:29.260]  Actually, they're probably stealing it from us.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.983]  But the point is, that's the original American flag.
[00:45:34.008 --> 00:45:34.989]  And they're saying you can't have it.
[00:45:35.009 --> 00:45:36.690]  Again, that's the level of this crap.
[00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:37.831]  I'm sorry, go ahead and play the video.
[00:45:39.292 --> 00:45:45.317]  That is what was, um, that's the reasoning behind them not having this label.
[00:45:45.377 --> 00:45:46.057]  The Gadsden Club.
[00:45:46.618 --> 00:45:47.518]  The Don't Try It On Me.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:49.340]  Okay.
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:50.361]  Which is the Gadsden Club.
[00:45:51.662 --> 00:45:51.922]  Okay.
[00:45:52.062 --> 00:45:53.903]  Um, okay.
[00:45:53.923 --> 00:45:59.728]  So he, he, um, he's, what's gonna happen if he doesn't take it off?
[00:46:01.548 --> 00:46:02.989]  I mean, he is able to go.
[00:46:03.089 --> 00:46:08.110]  I was actually just telling him, like, I was upset that he was missing so much school.
[00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:08.771]  I'm like, ah!
[00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:12.132]  So, I asked him, can you just take his stuff out of his bag and go back to class?
[00:46:12.172 --> 00:46:13.532]  Like, I just want him to go back to class.
[00:46:13.632 --> 00:46:15.333]  Alright, it goes on for another two and a half minutes.
[00:46:15.353 --> 00:46:18.614]  We're going to post it on the live show feed on InfoWars.com.
[00:46:18.674 --> 00:46:20.615]  So, that's who these people are.
[00:46:20.875 --> 00:46:21.755]  They want control of everything.
[00:46:22.216 --> 00:46:26.937]  Judge rejects sorority sister's lawsuit blocking trans women from joining.
[00:46:27.677 --> 00:46:28.878]  The court will not define a woman.
[00:46:31.087 --> 00:46:34.848]  But they'll define your quote, a minority for special benefits.
[00:46:36.649 --> 00:46:41.410]  Half of transgender prison inmates convicted of sex crimes, Wisconsin data shows.
[00:46:43.191 --> 00:46:47.992]  Parents slam California school for holding no whites allowed kids play date at school.
[00:46:48.452 --> 00:46:52.194]  The left's doing this everywhere to separate people, and it's weirdo white people running it.
[00:46:55.314 --> 00:46:58.535]  And again, judges are saying we're going to put a fat man in your sorority club.
[00:46:58.876 --> 00:46:59.856]  We can't define a woman.
[00:47:01.408 --> 00:47:03.070]  They're all waging war against us.
[00:47:03.591 --> 00:47:04.532]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:47:04.772 --> 00:47:06.814]  tweeted a very powerful tablet mag report.
[00:47:07.695 --> 00:47:08.356]  Everybody should read it.
[00:47:08.396 --> 00:47:09.177]  It's very lengthy.
[00:47:09.197 --> 00:47:09.597]  How the U.S.
[00:47:09.638 --> 00:47:11.099]  government is information enterprise.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.901]  It's destroying liberal democracy.
[00:47:13.602 --> 00:47:14.463]  I'm not exaggerating.
[00:47:14.523 --> 00:47:16.205]  Read this monumental article.
[00:47:16.245 --> 00:47:18.588]  Yeah, it's like 30, 40 pages long.
[00:47:18.608 --> 00:47:19.289]  I read the whole thing.
[00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:20.871]  Dead on.
[00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:34.502]  Meanwhile, Ireland's media minister says under the UN rules and the EU rules, the DSA, every state will designate a body when it comes to misinformation on the internet and fining, banning and arresting people.
[00:47:35.763 --> 00:47:36.483]  There's video of that.
[00:47:37.404 --> 00:47:42.930]  Fauci talks about having to go after people that say that masks don't work and that his shots don't work.
[00:47:44.371 --> 00:47:47.534]  The censorship is everywhere.
[00:47:51.263 --> 00:47:53.404]  All right, we're gonna go to break, start the next hour.
[00:47:54.264 --> 00:47:59.287]  We've got huge guests on, eyewitness reporters in Lahaina, in Maui.
[00:48:00.507 --> 00:48:02.348]  And this is a cautionary tale to everybody.
[00:48:03.068 --> 00:48:04.749]  Over a thousand dead children missing.
[00:48:04.929 --> 00:48:06.950]  They're putting up black curtains all around the town.
[00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:09.271]  I mean, this is a desperate cover-up.
[00:48:11.263 --> 00:48:12.144]  Happening right now.
[00:48:12.164 --> 00:48:13.485]  We're going to be talking about that.
[00:48:14.306 --> 00:48:16.207]  Coming up, we have huge Ukraine news.
[00:48:16.708 --> 00:48:17.989]  Ukraine has definitely lost the war.
[00:48:18.009 --> 00:48:19.430]  It's not Ukraine, the globalists have.
[00:48:20.451 --> 00:48:21.512]  That's all coming up.
[00:48:22.132 --> 00:48:24.154]  We've got a big second, third, and fourth hour.
[00:48:24.174 --> 00:48:25.475]  I'm hosting all four hours today.
[00:48:25.875 --> 00:48:29.438]  Please spread the word and tell people to tune in right now to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:48:29.559 --> 00:48:36.559]  When you do that, it changes the world.
[00:48:36.559 --> 00:48:43.559]  [Music]
[00:48:44.559 --> 00:48:50.559]  [Music]
[00:48:50.559 --> 00:48:52.559]  I need financing to fight the Globalist Plus.
[00:48:52.779 --> 00:48:53.960]  We've got great products you need.
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:55.221]  These are historic.
[00:48:55.701 --> 00:48:56.541]  They're one-of-a-kind.
[00:48:56.641 --> 00:48:58.662]  We sold out of Alex Jones for President shirt.
[00:48:59.123 --> 00:49:00.543]  Told you, these are all limited editions now.
[00:49:01.464 --> 00:49:11.529]  And we have a few of the Political Prisoner original mugshot, which is not the real mugshot, that you can get at infowarestore.com for $17.76.
[00:49:11.649 --> 00:49:18.242]   But what we do have being printed right now, Is the real Trump mugshot Never Surrender t-shirt.
[00:49:18.962 --> 00:49:20.383]  And on the front says Trump 2024.
[00:49:20.764 --> 00:49:22.745]  On the back it says Never Surrender.
[00:49:22.765 --> 00:49:23.786]  That's what he said yesterday.
[00:49:23.926 --> 00:49:25.507]  Infowars.com.
[00:49:25.607 --> 00:49:30.891]  So Trump 2024 in black and white and in gold with Never Surrender on the back.
[00:49:31.311 --> 00:49:33.873]  And that's a designer shirt, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:34.113 --> 00:49:35.874]  High quality fabric, high quality printing.
[00:49:36.535 --> 00:49:40.478]  So when we're selling these for $17.76, we paid like 15 bucks for these.
[00:49:41.158 --> 00:49:43.019]  So we're just selling that one almost at cost.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.340]  It's almost gone.
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:50.380]   So the original limited edition political prisoner shirt that is not the accurate mug shot,
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:53.139]   something we came up with, when they were originally gonna do it, didn't.
[00:49:53.139 --> 00:49:56.860]  Then we now have the real mug shot.
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.059]  And if you want those, they're being printed right now.
[00:49:59.059 --> 00:50:02.980]   Anybody tells you you've got the shirt, it isn't a two week wait, is full of it.
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.860]  We put the order in this morning.
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:07.180]  They'll be done in about a week and a half.
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:09.219]  They're making them right here in Texas.
[00:50:09.219 --> 00:50:10.300]  They'll be shipping out.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:16.059]   So get your orders in now to get a piece of history, Trump 2024 in black and white,
[00:50:16.059 --> 00:50:19.860]   the real mug shot, never surrender on the back, Infowars.com.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:21.778]  And we have the gold one as well.
[00:50:21.778 --> 00:50:25.260]   I think the gold will be the most popular, but we will see.
[00:50:25.544 --> 00:50:26.865]  All three shirts now available.
[00:50:27.186 --> 00:50:28.226]  The original, ready to ship.
[00:50:28.567 --> 00:50:30.048]  Limited edition, about to sell out.
[00:50:30.448 --> 00:50:31.929]  And we also have a flash sale of X3.
[00:50:31.989 --> 00:50:33.690]  Limited supply came in.
[00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:34.731]  And Vita Mineral Fusion.
[00:50:35.051 --> 00:50:36.533]  Both are selling out very, very quickly.
[00:50:36.873 --> 00:50:38.474]  But despite that, they're 40% off.
[00:50:38.814 --> 00:50:40.335]  That's what finances this operation.
[00:50:40.155 --> 00:50:59.354]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:50:59.526 --> 00:51:01.688]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:51:03.629 --> 00:51:09.629]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:51:33.129 --> 00:51:38.629]   In 1972, The Limits to Growth was published by the Club of Rome.
[00:51:38.917 --> 00:51:45.180]  The book suggested that swift human depopulation would save the planet.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:52.004]  In 2018, The Limits to Growth co-author Dennis Meadows explained how we need to murder billions of people.
[00:51:52.324 --> 00:51:59.308]  The planet can support something like a billion people.
[00:52:01.648 --> 00:52:07.616]  Maybe two billion, depending on how much liberty and how much material consumption you want to have.
[00:52:07.636 --> 00:52:13.222]  If you want more liberty and more consumption, you have to have fewer people.
[00:52:13.843 --> 00:52:16.306]  And conversely, you can have more people.
[00:52:16.326 --> 00:52:24.113]   I mean, we could even have Eight or nine billion, probably, if we have a very strong dictatorship, which is smart.
[00:52:24.934 --> 00:52:27.336]  Unfortunately, you never have smart dictatorships.
[00:52:27.356 --> 00:52:28.336]  They're always stupid.
[00:52:28.636 --> 00:52:32.459]  But if you had a smart dictatorship and a low standard of living, you could have it.
[00:52:33.239 --> 00:52:35.901]  But we want to have freedom and we want to have a high sentence.
[00:52:36.241 --> 00:52:37.542]  So we're going to have a billion people.
[00:52:37.983 --> 00:52:38.843]  And we're now at seven.
[00:52:39.484 --> 00:52:40.504]  So we have to get back down.
[00:52:41.285 --> 00:52:48.810]  I hope that this can be slow, relatively slow, and that it can be done in a way which is relatively equal.
[00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:51.152]  Overpopulation is a lie.
[00:52:51.532 --> 00:52:58.977]  With old-school sustainable farming and the end of big government, there is enough room on this planet for several billion.
[00:52:59.598 --> 00:53:05.282]  And while the Earth's climate does change, most of what we are seeing is contrived.
[00:53:05.782 --> 00:53:10.206]  The fires breaking out all across the world are being blamed on climate change.
[00:53:10.626 --> 00:53:13.827]  Even though hundreds of arsonists have been caught starting them.
[00:53:14.187 --> 00:53:19.229]  Most recently, 79 people were arrested for starting fires in Greece.
[00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:29.793]  Direct energy weapons, or DEWS, are able to start fires from above and can utilize microwave technology to burn homes from within.
[00:53:31.094 --> 00:53:36.056]  In 2013, the mainstream media reported that we were able to make rain and lightning.
[00:53:36.076 --> 00:53:37.456]  I mean, lasers?
[00:53:37.796 --> 00:53:38.237]  Really?
[00:53:38.337 --> 00:53:39.197]  To change the weather?
[00:53:39.457 --> 00:53:43.860]  By firing trillion-watt lasers, you rip apart the electrons, creating what I call ions.
[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:49.384]  And these ions act like seeds, like dust particles, bringing down rain and even lightning.
[00:53:49.644 --> 00:53:54.688]  This week in Michigan, residents reported a strange strobe-like lightning.
[00:53:55.308 --> 00:54:00.592]  The event was captured on weather radar, which showed a very unnatural-looking spiral.
[00:54:02.173 --> 00:54:04.375]  That's some conspiracy theory shit right there.
[00:54:05.094 --> 00:54:09.377]  Making it rain has been possible for decades, and we have come a long way since then.
[00:54:09.757 --> 00:54:24.306]  With the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, known as HAARP, we can now create hurricanes, and we can control their direction with next-generation weather radar transmitters, known as NEXRAD.
[00:54:25.086 --> 00:54:37.932]  By building up an electromagnetic charge and dispersing it underground as direct current VLF waves or very low frequency waves, the NEXRAD radar transmitters are able to trigger earthquakes.
[00:54:38.732 --> 00:54:41.674]  Earthquakes and explosives can trigger tsunamis.
[00:54:42.854 --> 00:54:48.516]  These are the technologies that we know of, and that only leaves volcanoes and tornadoes.
[00:54:49.477 --> 00:54:59.941]  Funded by Peter Thiel, AVE Tech Energy Corporation began work in 2012 on a device to produce a 130-foot-tall tornado.
[00:55:00.261 --> 00:55:01.161]  And a former U.S.
[00:55:01.221 --> 00:55:05.723]  intelligence officer recently told State of the Nation that the U.S.
[00:55:05.923 --> 00:55:07.804]  has already triggered a volcano.
[00:55:08.604 --> 00:55:16.408]  Climate change is not only a hoax, it's a depopulation program, and our entire government is going along with it.
[00:55:17.389 --> 00:55:20.588]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:55:45.228 --> 00:55:52.827]   It's been more than two weeks, what, 20 days or so since the tragic, historic fires hit
[00:55:52.827 --> 00:55:59.309]   Maui, Hawaii, in Lahaina, a place I've been many, many times for well watching and
[00:55:59.309 --> 00:56:06.827]   luau's, you name it, one of the best places in my favorite place to visit in the 50 states, Hawaii.
[00:56:06.827 --> 00:56:07.669]  Bye.
[00:56:08.195 --> 00:56:17.297]  And when we first saw eyewitnesses like Fish and others, who I looked up in our town fixtures, who are very credible, saying that they blocked off the roads, I was blown away.
[00:56:18.097 --> 00:56:19.277]  I believed him, but I had to prove it.
[00:56:19.997 --> 00:56:22.618]  Then the locals came forward and said, no, same thing happened to us.
[00:56:22.658 --> 00:56:27.498]  And then countless videos of people that went ahead and broke through the blockade that survived.
[00:56:28.038 --> 00:56:29.319]  Thousands others didn't.
[00:56:29.679 --> 00:56:31.239]  But the big question is, where are the children?
[00:56:32.859 --> 00:56:36.500]  Now, Fish called it a coordinated event.
[00:56:37.563 --> 00:56:39.484]  Or choreographed destruction.
[00:56:40.125 --> 00:56:41.646]  I called it administrative mass murder.
[00:56:41.686 --> 00:56:42.987]  We don't blame the police themselves.
[00:56:43.847 --> 00:56:46.830]  They were compartmentalized and didn't know that both ends had been blocked.
[00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:48.531]  They didn't know the fire was coming in.
[00:56:48.611 --> 00:56:52.293]  Once they did, basically too late, they tried to let the folks through.
[00:56:52.414 --> 00:56:52.994]  Some got out.
[00:56:53.935 --> 00:56:57.037]  So for the balance of the hour, Eric West joins us.
[00:56:58.017 --> 00:57:01.980]  He's a well-known real estate agent and businessman in the area, very respected.
[00:57:02.501 --> 00:57:03.701]  He's also a citizen journalist.
[00:57:04.765 --> 00:57:09.587]  And he has been showing the black tarps they're putting up around the town, the 12-mile exclusion zone.
[00:57:10.067 --> 00:57:12.988]  He was manhandled and thrown out yesterday.
[00:57:13.668 --> 00:57:19.090]  We've got that video coming up, but we know they left almost all the power on.
[00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:20.250]  They did turn off one system.
[00:57:21.691 --> 00:57:24.192]  Now, Blackrock that owns it's denying it, but it's all confirmed.
[00:57:24.212 --> 00:57:30.534]  We see the power lines falling, the fires, countless videos of people's ring doorbells.
[00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:46.976]  We see them not delivering in the water, denying it that day, during the fires, admitting they did it, with the local water district that is headed up by an Obama Foundation member, who's big in Hawaii, obviously.
[00:57:49.017 --> 00:57:53.718]  And then we learn about the blockade, and the sirens not being turned on.
[00:57:54.459 --> 00:57:55.939]  It's simply staggering.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.961]  So I've got a lot of videos to play here, and we're going to be getting to them.
[00:58:00.976 --> 00:58:10.179]  Of this citizen being thrown out of his own town yesterday in a live stream of the cover-up.
[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:14.001]  And the big question is, who gave the orders?
[00:58:14.781 --> 00:58:23.664]  Who coordinated this symphony of destruction, or as Fish called it, coordinated destruction?
[00:58:23.984 --> 00:58:28.926]  Because you can have, as Fish said and as Eric West said, one thing fail.
[00:58:30.319 --> 00:58:31.279]  Maybe he should say it in his own words.
[00:58:31.299 --> 00:58:33.500]  He says it better than I. You'd say, well, that can happen.
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:34.341]  Or two, yeah, maybe.
[00:58:34.781 --> 00:58:45.685]  But when everything fails perfectly, and it's the most valuable land in the United States, per square inch, in that little town, it's incredible.
[00:58:47.046 --> 00:58:48.406]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:58:49.167 --> 00:58:53.348]  And some of these families are completely wiped away, and we're not hearing anything about them.
[00:58:53.508 --> 00:58:55.249]  The mainstream media is not asking, where are the children?
[00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:59.011]  So, joining us is Eric West of hawaiirealestate.org.
[00:59:00.242 --> 00:59:06.207]  MauiLFG.org and I'm told by locals he's doing a great job actually getting aid to them.
[00:59:07.287 --> 00:59:13.072]  We have FEMA getting $1,000 a night rooms at the Four Seasons owned by Bill Gates.
[00:59:15.194 --> 00:59:18.196]  Hawaii is very expensive because the billionaires that have all moved there, over 100 of them.
[00:59:20.871 --> 00:59:28.536]  And the cheapest hotels, $200, $300 a night, $700 one-time payment for whole families, when almost $200 billion has been shipped to Ukraine.
[00:59:28.576 --> 00:59:36.161]  This is a sick joke, but it's really captured the soul of America and the world, and people are really having a big wake-up here.
[00:59:36.441 --> 00:59:40.504]  Biden refused in four different events for the first couple of weeks to even talk about it.
[00:59:41.144 --> 00:59:42.405]  Then he did show up.
[00:59:43.286 --> 00:59:52.707]   So to talk about the waterfront, and what really happened is Eric West, And we'll go through these videos if you want to.
[00:59:53.786 --> 00:59:54.706]  And ask which one you want.
[00:59:54.946 --> 00:59:55.486]  We'll play them.
[00:59:55.626 --> 00:59:57.687]  We're getting the clip right now of them handling you.
[00:59:58.047 --> 00:59:58.967]  We just learned about that.
[00:59:59.347 --> 01:00:00.287]  They've done it to other reporters.
[01:00:00.307 --> 01:00:00.847]  We've seen the footage.
[01:00:00.867 --> 01:00:07.809]  But first, here's a short two-and-a-half-minute compilation from a 30-something minute interview we did with Fish a couple other days ago.
[01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:10.949]  And again, Fish is somebody who's not from there.
[01:00:11.009 --> 01:00:12.450]  I call him a local, but he's a fixture.
[01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:13.010]  They all love him.
[01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:14.670]  And he's very respected.
[01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:15.890]  And he told us what he saw.
[01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:17.851]  He was the first voice that got out.
[01:00:18.191 --> 01:00:18.771]  Barely survived.
[01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:20.612]  But now we have the videos.
[01:00:20.692 --> 01:00:21.332]  It's all confirmed.
[01:00:21.372 --> 01:00:22.693]  They admit they left the power on.
[01:00:22.993 --> 01:00:24.154]  They admit they didn't give them the water.
[01:00:24.494 --> 01:00:26.675]  They admit they didn't trim the trees and brush.
[01:00:27.495 --> 01:00:29.036]  They admit they didn't activate the sirens.
[01:00:29.056 --> 01:00:30.677]  They admit they blockaded them inside.
[01:00:32.758 --> 01:00:37.441]  But here is what Fish said a few days ago with Eric West.
[01:00:38.021 --> 01:00:40.902]  The only people survived are the ones that went through the barricade.
[01:00:40.922 --> 01:00:45.505]  It was a choreographed disaster.
[01:00:46.303 --> 01:00:48.606]  You know, the pattern of it is just too obvious.
[01:00:48.626 --> 01:01:00.121]  You know, not only were they blocking where I was at, the other end of town I found out they had, Maui Electric was trying to set the poles up during the wind, and they had the highway blocked off with that.
[01:01:02.244 --> 01:01:06.566]  The lack of communication, the sirens not going off, the water not being used.
[01:01:06.587 --> 01:01:08.848]  I mean, you could go on and on.
[01:01:10.769 --> 01:01:14.952]  And then they're lying to us about the people and the children.
[01:01:14.972 --> 01:01:18.675]  That's why a lot of people have been contacting me because they want to know what happened to the kids.
[01:01:19.095 --> 01:01:20.536]  All you have to do is extrapolate.
[01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:24.518]  There's 3,001 students in Lahaina.
[01:01:24.538 --> 01:01:25.939]  1,000 of them have been accounted for.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:29.041]  They're going to either alternative schools or online.
[01:01:29.602 --> 01:01:30.062]  That's 2,000 children.
[01:01:31.343 --> 01:01:37.663]   not accounted for. And I looked over at the policeman and I said, "What are you doing?"
[01:01:37.663 --> 01:01:43.102]   He says, "I'm just following orders." I said, "There's a fire back there."
[01:01:43.102 --> 01:01:50.862]   And he goes, "I'm just following orders and I'm wondering what is going on."
[01:01:51.123 --> 01:02:05.551]  Well, it's something probably anyone who's been on the internet for 30 years like I have knows, that BlackRock and Vanguard are the owners of the Hawaiian Electric Company, where FEMA's stand at their $1,000 plus rooms is owned by Bill Gates.
[01:02:07.092 --> 01:02:09.013]  All the same names keep popping up.
[01:02:09.553 --> 01:02:16.459]  The sheriff who was involved with the Las Vegas Duplico, he was here for five weeks.
[01:02:16.919 --> 01:02:19.441]  He wants a 29% increase in pay.
[01:02:19.461 --> 01:02:22.323]  And he's not only the police chief, but he's the coroner.
[01:02:22.823 --> 01:02:23.043]  Right.
[01:02:23.204 --> 01:02:25.025]  Which is against the statute, right?
[01:02:25.065 --> 01:02:26.586]  Against the statute of the Hawaii law.
[01:02:26.666 --> 01:02:27.847]  But there it is.
[01:02:28.087 --> 01:02:29.428]  You know, what are you going to do about it?
[01:02:29.969 --> 01:02:30.189]  Right.
[01:02:30.269 --> 01:02:32.070]  So, he's in charge as the coroner.
[01:02:33.431 --> 01:02:39.720]  Well, it's the same as Hunter Thompson who wrote a book on George Bush and he was very excited about getting it published.
[01:02:40.181 --> 01:02:44.387]  Two days before it was getting published, he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head twice.
[01:02:44.407 --> 01:02:48.072]  Turner put it out as a suicide.
[01:02:48.893 --> 01:02:49.073]  So...
[01:02:51.098 --> 01:02:59.105]  And the same video, we'll play clips coming up, he witnessed them block the road out and, after they directed people into the town, the road out the other direction.
[01:02:59.886 --> 01:03:01.467]  So, who gave the orders?
[01:03:01.967 --> 01:03:04.049]  Eric West, thank you for joining us today.
[01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:13.858]  I'm going to try to give you the floor until we got a break in about 15 minutes to talk about what you witnessed, what you've seen, the bizarreness of this, the ongoing obvious cover-up.
[01:03:15.137 --> 01:03:16.158]  How the people are responding.
[01:03:16.198 --> 01:03:17.760]  I've seen the different council meetings.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.142]  The Hawaiians are usually pretty calm and nice.
[01:03:20.182 --> 01:03:21.063]  They're hopping mad.
[01:03:21.483 --> 01:03:25.527]  Both the people that are indigenous, but also folks that have now called Hawaii home.
[01:03:26.048 --> 01:03:27.249]  So you're right in the middle of it.
[01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:29.972]  You've got a lot of courage to be going up against this system.
[01:03:30.552 --> 01:03:31.253]  Give us your breakdown.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.442]  First of all, thanks Alex for having me on the show.
[01:03:35.462 --> 01:03:36.383]  I appreciate it.
[01:03:36.423 --> 01:03:58.189]   I've been following you for years and I just want to just give you a shout out for what you've done as a patriot and for leading the charge in this thing and everything that they say was a conspiracy as always seems to come true and I want to get in front of this thing so we'll talk about what's happened but I really want to encourage your listeners Let's get into action here.
[01:03:58.751 --> 01:04:03.843]  Let's make this a call to action, not just to fellow patriots, but to the world because I believe this is...
[01:04:04.736 --> 01:04:28.063]   The beginning of something really bad or can be the beginning of something really amazing in terms of an awakening and this is now in the world stage and this needs to be played out in the world court if you will because there's people that died here that were from all different countries and as you know a lot of things become an issue as jurisdiction and I don't believe this is is no longer in the jurisdiction of Hawaii?
[01:04:28.123 --> 01:04:30.625]  I believe this is not even in the jurisdiction of the federal courts.
[01:04:30.665 --> 01:04:34.888]  I believe this is in the jurisdiction of the world, and the world needs to pay attention and needs to wake up.
[01:04:35.668 --> 01:04:41.993]  But I'll walk you through what's happened so far, and I could go through the colossal list of items that have gone wrong.
[01:04:42.013 --> 01:04:42.233]  Please!
[01:04:42.273 --> 01:04:42.593]  You live there?
[01:04:42.613 --> 01:04:42.933]  Break it down.
[01:04:46.514 --> 01:04:53.442]  Okay, the colossal list of everything that went wrong simultaneously, and I'm not here to point the finger at who or what.
[01:04:53.963 --> 01:04:57.026]  I'm just going to show you what we are seeing and what we've seen.
[01:04:57.046 --> 01:05:05.035]  But let's begin with the first thing, which is the total, utter lack of communication that we've had on the west side of Maui.
[01:05:05.115 --> 01:05:08.978]   I'm here Just north of the burn zone, north of Lahaina, very close.
[01:05:08.998 --> 01:05:11.879]  The fire came within a mile or two of my home.
[01:05:12.259 --> 01:05:14.681]  We've been evacuated three times.
[01:05:14.981 --> 01:05:18.563]  We've had fields set fire around my home.
[01:05:18.643 --> 01:05:27.407]  Just the other day, I went live with a fire that broke out just a few yards from my house spontaneously in the middle of the day.
[01:05:27.767 --> 01:05:30.269]  On that particular day, the alarms went off.
[01:05:30.609 --> 01:05:32.290]  Chinook helicopters came in.
[01:05:32.550 --> 01:05:37.510]   We got text messages, so it's almost like, like see, we can, we, they're trying to show
[01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:41.350]   that they're competent now, but back when the big fire broke out
[01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:45.530]   and there was multiple fires, it wasn't just a fire in Kula that broke out,
[01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:48.909]   but also a fire in the Haina, but there was multiple different places
[01:05:48.909 --> 01:05:50.589]  where this thing broke out.
[01:05:50.589 --> 01:05:54.470]   On that particular day, everything that could have gone wrong went wrong.
[01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:56.778]  For example, there was no sirens.
[01:05:57.138 --> 01:06:00.659]  Hawaii has the most sophisticated siren system.
[01:06:01.059 --> 01:06:02.060]  It did not go off.
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:10.563]  And they tried to spin it by saying that we're trained as the people here to run uphill because it's a tsunami warning.
[01:06:10.643 --> 01:06:12.383]  But their own website says it's not.
[01:06:12.423 --> 01:06:13.423]  It's for emergencies.
[01:06:13.944 --> 01:06:18.065]  And when the alarm goes off, you're supposed to tune in to find out what the danger is and act accordingly.
[01:06:18.545 --> 01:06:22.687]  But to this day, they haven't retracted their statement that's saying it's for tsunamis only.
[01:06:23.107 --> 01:06:26.308]  Even if it was, people would not run uphill into a fire.
[01:06:26.728 --> 01:06:28.809]  So the sirens did not go off.
[01:06:29.209 --> 01:06:32.950]  The text messages, we received text messages all the time for emergencies.
[01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:35.871]  Those text messages also were not sent out.
[01:06:36.752 --> 01:06:42.034]  And we were able to receive text messages throughout this entire breakdown of communication.
[01:06:42.294 --> 01:06:43.734]  Text messages always worked.
[01:06:43.774 --> 01:06:45.895]  We could never respond to them.
[01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:47.756]  But the text messages didn't go out.
[01:06:48.076 --> 01:06:51.899]  There was water was not provided in the area of the fire.
[01:06:51.939 --> 01:07:01.045]  I have eyewitness accounts of people that came home that morning and they couldn't take a shower or they couldn't turn on their washer at home because there was no water.
[01:07:01.846 --> 01:07:12.055]  So the firemen had no water to fight this fire, and then they try to say it was because of some kind of water rights issue, which is ridiculous because either the water works or the water doesn't work.
[01:07:12.075 --> 01:07:13.316]  So why was the water turned off?
[01:07:13.656 --> 01:07:17.139]  That day at 4.30 in the morning, there was no power.
[01:07:17.739 --> 01:07:20.482]  Power was turned off on the entire west side of Maui.
[01:07:20.942 --> 01:07:28.969]  So later on in the day, you'll find out they were trying to redirect cars around downed power lines as if the downed power lines were dangerous because of electricity.
[01:07:29.289 --> 01:07:36.492]  But there's no electricity running through those downed power lines, so they could have quickly, you know, moved those poles or sawed them or done something.
[01:07:36.812 --> 01:07:43.715]  But instead, you saw people getting corralled, literally, into the town of Lahaina in the direct path of the fire.
[01:07:44.075 --> 01:07:46.576]  And that is irrefutable.
[01:07:47.237 --> 01:07:48.557]  I have many, many accounts.
[01:07:48.597 --> 01:07:51.738]  And I don't mean to interrupt you, but you're the expert, but I've been following this very closely.
[01:07:51.758 --> 01:07:55.060]  Some of the main power lines out on the highway were turned off.
[01:07:56.067 --> 01:08:03.696]  But the particular power lines in the town, we've seen the footage, and they've admitted, even the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post, that indeed they left those on.
[01:08:03.996 --> 01:08:05.959]  We've seen those falling down and starting fires.
[01:08:06.319 --> 01:08:07.541]  So can you explain that to us?
[01:08:09.096 --> 01:08:29.007]  Well I can only go from what I've heard personally and talking to people is that the power was lost at 4.30, the morning of the fire, 4.30am by other people that have reported that there were certain, I guess there's websites where you can see where there was pulsing, there was different pulsing through the electrical system, but we did not have any power.
[01:08:29.747 --> 01:08:39.790]  The silver lining in all this is because there was no power, the restaurants were closed that morning, the shops were closed that morning because no one could obviously transact business.
[01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:48.432]  So, in a sense, that was a godsend because the Lahaina town wasn't full of all the normal hustle and bustle because there was no power that morning.
[01:08:48.672 --> 01:08:50.453]  There was definitely no cell communication.
[01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:54.254]  You could not call anybody, you could not get on the internet that morning.
[01:08:54.654 --> 01:08:58.774]  It was a complete communications blackout.
[01:08:58.774 --> 01:09:03.413]   And then on top of it, you have absolutely no support on the ground from people going
[01:09:03.413 --> 01:09:05.654]  door to door, knocking or bullhorns.
[01:09:05.654 --> 01:09:08.974]  The people were warned by word of mouth.
[01:09:09.017 --> 01:09:14.919]  The only warning that they had with this blowtorch coming at them was word-of-mouth warning.
[01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:23.921]  Also, I noticed at 1030 in the morning a massive black cloud of smoke that looked like the 9-11 towers.
[01:09:24.402 --> 01:09:30.123]  And so there was a small brush fire that occurred that morning and a message went out for that saying 100% contained.
[01:09:31.884 --> 01:09:36.889]  So they actually put everybody at rest saying that the fire was contained that morning.
[01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:42.694]  So there was even misinformation happening trying to make people feel like they were safe when in fact they weren't.
[01:09:43.415 --> 01:09:51.743]  But the fact that people were guided into the fire and then got trapped and were going in circles in this small little Lahaina town, it's incomprehensible.
[01:09:51.763 --> 01:09:57.188]  Alright, I want to keep making your points but let's walk through this.
[01:09:59.221 --> 01:10:02.284]  The government is now saying only some of the power was turned off.
[01:10:02.324 --> 01:10:06.027]  The Washington Post is reporting that it wasn't turned off.
[01:10:06.127 --> 01:10:12.933]  I'm not wedded to the idea that power lines did it, even though we have footage of power lines falling and causing fires and transformers blowing up.
[01:10:13.914 --> 01:10:14.814]  But clearly...
[01:10:15.595 --> 01:10:17.636]  Something massive burned that town down.
[01:10:18.076 --> 01:10:20.077]  I'm not poo-pooed directed energy weapons.
[01:10:20.117 --> 01:10:20.857]  I know they're real.
[01:10:21.257 --> 01:10:23.378]  Like one of the biggest bases of them is based in Maui.
[01:10:23.798 --> 01:10:27.900]  They could have drones go up and do it and no humans could be involved other than those that launched the attack.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:33.282]  But regardless, for folks that don't know, we'll pull up a map of Lahaina.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.321]  They're in Maui.
[01:10:37.361 --> 01:10:39.481]  They're in what, Western Maui.
[01:10:40.602 --> 01:10:48.484]  Describe the roads coming in for people and what has now been confirmed that police blocked both sides of the main road.
[01:10:48.524 --> 01:10:51.806]  I guess that's Front Street coming through the town from the west and the east.
[01:10:52.106 --> 01:10:52.726]  Is that accurate?
[01:10:54.315 --> 01:10:58.199]  Yeah, so if you look at a map, you'll see that there's basically two different highways.
[01:10:58.219 --> 01:11:02.343]  You have the bypass that comes down and dumps into the north.
[01:11:02.383 --> 01:11:04.746]  We're about the middle part of Lahaina.
[01:11:05.066 --> 01:11:06.347]  That's called the bypass.
[01:11:06.367 --> 01:11:08.730]  They just opened that, you know, four or five years ago.
[01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:12.449]   And then you have the old highway, which is the Honopidilani Highway.
[01:11:12.449 --> 01:11:16.569]   And then on the other side of that, to the west of that, you have basically the town
[01:11:16.569 --> 01:11:17.569]  of Lahaina.
[01:11:17.569 --> 01:11:21.769]   And you've got a number of side streets, but you have Front Street, the world famous Front
[01:11:21.769 --> 01:11:25.729]   Street that's sort of like the PCH, it runs right up the coast.
[01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:30.969]   So ultimately, as people were trying to get in, to just get through town,
[01:11:30.981 --> 01:11:31.922]  Go around town.
[01:11:31.962 --> 01:11:33.483]  They try to go up the bypass.
[01:11:33.523 --> 01:11:34.744]  They're trying to leave town.
[01:11:35.064 --> 01:11:36.125]  They got turned around.
[01:11:36.185 --> 01:11:38.127]  The bypass was closed, so you couldn't.
[01:11:38.387 --> 01:11:40.769]  So if you were leaving town, you just got turned right back around.
[01:11:41.129 --> 01:11:44.992]  If you tried to go south on the highway, you got turned.
[01:11:45.212 --> 01:11:47.914]  Everyone got routed into the town of Lahaina.
[01:11:47.974 --> 01:12:00.963]   And once you got into Lahaina proper, as if you tried to leave to the north or to the south or any of the side streets, Ed Cheney, many different witnesses said that there's two police cars that would block that.
[01:12:01.323 --> 01:12:04.065]  The owners of Island Lock and Safety were just in my home the other day.
[01:12:04.085 --> 01:12:13.710]  They also basically testified to that everywhere you tried to leave, you just kept getting routed back into it under the guise of downed power lines.
[01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:18.292]  However, looking at some of this footage, you can see there was a clear path to the north.
[01:12:18.312 --> 01:12:19.893]  There was a clear path to the south.
[01:12:20.493 --> 01:12:27.617]  And on top of it, the cars that were coming into Lahaina, they didn't block the traffic like, you know, a mile or two away, preventing this.
[01:12:27.877 --> 01:12:41.484]  They had a small blockade and they were allowing this traffic to come into Lahaina because people were trying to get to their kids, they're trying to get to their houses, they're concerned, but they were allowing essentially a traffic jam very close to the north end of Lahaina.
[01:12:41.805 --> 01:12:53.411]   And then on top of it, the people that were coming down to the south, they were getting routed into a neighborhood called Wahikuli that later on burned But they weren't turning people around to go back to the north.
[01:12:53.732 --> 01:12:57.234]  They were putting them into another neighborhood that was getting ready to burn.
[01:12:57.254 --> 01:13:14.726]  So the traffic control during this disaster is incomprehensible that there could be that level of incompetence basically directing people into the path of something extremely dangerous, extremely hot burning, and just a force of nature that we've never seen before.
[01:13:18.103 --> 01:13:20.545]  Now we've still got about six and five minutes to break.
[01:13:20.685 --> 01:13:24.488]  Let's let's talk about something you just mentioned a few minutes ago.
[01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:33.896]  You live there on the edge of town and where you're staying you're saying suddenly fires out of nowhere.
[01:13:34.923 --> 01:13:37.384]  There's no power lines, there's no people, right around your house.
[01:13:37.965 --> 01:13:40.046]  And obviously you're a very outspoken person.
[01:13:40.786 --> 01:13:47.871]  We have weird leftists showing up harassing reporters that are on The War Room with Steve Bannon.
[01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:51.793]  Other reporters are having weird Antifa-type dudes in black show up.
[01:13:52.293 --> 01:13:55.795]  They know where they are, and they threaten them to stop covering it.
[01:13:55.815 --> 01:13:57.876]  We're going to show footage when we come back of you getting manhandled.
[01:13:58.197 --> 01:13:59.738]  There's a 12-mile exclusion zone.
[01:13:59.758 --> 01:14:05.725]   They're putting up big black Divider fences up all around the town.
[01:14:06.205 --> 01:14:10.428]  They don't want people on record, even mainstream media, showing the damage.
[01:14:10.708 --> 01:14:12.689]  So something's being covered up here.
[01:14:12.989 --> 01:14:17.973]  You're there showing cars that are 100 yards from anything, even a fire, that are burned up.
[01:14:18.413 --> 01:14:20.754]  And that does lean towards directed energy or something.
[01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:21.695]  I can't deny it.
[01:14:22.475 --> 01:14:24.176]  And so maybe it's a mix of these things.
[01:14:24.777 --> 01:14:26.018]  But you talked about arson.
[01:14:26.958 --> 01:14:27.799]  Here it is, BBC.
[01:14:29.295 --> 01:14:31.916]  Grease wildfires, 79 people arrested for arson.
[01:14:32.156 --> 01:14:33.577]  There's high winds, it's dry.
[01:14:34.097 --> 01:14:37.859]  They went and caught 79 people setting fires.
[01:14:38.759 --> 01:14:42.340]  And we know environmentalists just don't block roads like Extinction Rebellion.
[01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:44.041]  They don't just cut off our pipelines.
[01:14:44.061 --> 01:14:49.406]   They don't just put these big Derailleurs on trains, they've been caught everywhere.
[01:14:49.866 --> 01:14:56.288]  When they get caught, like right during the election in 2000, they caught hundreds of arsonists setting fires on the West Coast.
[01:14:57.128 --> 01:15:04.510]  And the same thing, the utilities owned by BlackRock again, on average, they own what, 98% of your utilities, or 96%.
[01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:09.231]  They won't trim back the trees now, but only in select areas, knowing it's going to happen.
[01:15:09.491 --> 01:15:26.753]   So here's footage of Greece, and people having to evacuate to the water, and the police I've caught 79 people doing it, and they say in the Greece News, they say it's environmental groups doing it.
[01:15:28.982 --> 01:15:30.043]  This is disgusting.
[01:15:30.083 --> 01:15:31.564]  So can you give us your view on that?
[01:15:31.904 --> 01:15:33.585]  And specifically, go back and elaborate.
[01:15:34.045 --> 01:15:35.146]  We'll go to break and talk more about it.
[01:15:35.186 --> 01:15:39.028]  But on where you live, you've got a couple places.
[01:15:39.068 --> 01:15:40.429]  You're blocked out of your house right now.
[01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:41.089]  You're somewhere else.
[01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:45.792]  And now folks know where you are and magically fires are popping up right around you.
[01:15:45.812 --> 01:15:46.913]  I mean, let's walk through that.
[01:15:48.396 --> 01:15:49.837]  Yeah, it's a real mystery.
[01:15:49.977 --> 01:15:59.422]  Matter of fact, the most recent fire that broke out just a couple days ago, I live in an area called Kaanapali, which is right above the hotels where they're housing all the survivors.
[01:16:00.182 --> 01:16:08.094]   And ironically, FEMA and all the other agents are down in Wailea, which is a long way from here, like 45 Minute drive minimum.
[01:16:08.354 --> 01:16:12.337]  So why there's a separation between the Federal Health and the Red Cross is very strange.
[01:16:12.377 --> 01:16:24.805]  But to answer your question, Alex, these fires have just been popping up and I've got video of the one that I just shot live the other day where the area where the fire probably started, they immediately had a D8 out there.
[01:16:25.324 --> 01:16:28.125]  pushing dirt over where the fires started.
[01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:31.623]   And I thought to myself, why isn't there an investigation to see what was,
[01:16:31.623 --> 01:16:33.923]  what started this particular fire?
[01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:37.824]   So, yeah, it just seems very unusual how these fires started.
[01:16:37.824 --> 01:16:43.125]   But I think the question I want to ask the world is, what are we going to do about this, right?
[01:16:43.125 --> 01:16:44.125]  What are we going to do?
[01:16:44.125 --> 01:16:47.023]   We can talk about what happened and how it happened and all that stuff.
[01:16:47.023 --> 01:16:50.724]   But what are we going to do about our rights that are being violated right now?
[01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:52.011]  We're not allowed to take pictures.
[01:16:52.031 --> 01:16:53.151]  We're not allowed to fly drones.
[01:16:53.431 --> 01:16:58.794]  We're not allowed to see what's going on and or collect evidence to see if there was any kind of an accelerant.
[01:16:59.234 --> 01:17:02.915]  What is America going to do right now to stop the cover-up?
[01:17:03.215 --> 01:17:07.437]  Because if we don't stop this one, it's going to be in your backyard next.
[01:17:07.697 --> 01:17:12.804]  So what can we do now to find out what they've done and to stop the course of action?
[01:17:13.085 --> 01:17:16.590]  Whatever their plan is, we need Patriots to step up.
[01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:17.591]  This isn't entertainment.
[01:17:17.631 --> 01:17:19.153]  This is a call to action to the world.
[01:17:20.715 --> 01:17:21.557]  You know, I watched.
[01:17:23.499 --> 01:17:26.680]  You a lot in the last few weeks, but in the last few days, you did two different videos with fish.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:27.580]  I forget which one it is.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.721]  We've got both of them on the computer.
[01:17:28.741 --> 01:17:29.241]  We can play them.
[01:17:29.261 --> 01:17:31.662]  I don't know if it was you or fish, you both agreed.
[01:17:31.822 --> 01:17:34.643]  They said, listen, this is a model of how to burn people out everywhere.
[01:17:34.923 --> 01:17:36.443]  Well, actually, I've already been tracking that.
[01:17:36.843 --> 01:17:45.026]  California is where they first started this decades ago, where areas they want to move poor people out there and wealthy areas they're about to grow to.
[01:17:46.266 --> 01:17:47.187]  They don't trim the trees.
[01:17:47.207 --> 01:17:48.027]  They don't trim the brush.
[01:17:49.608 --> 01:17:52.571]  And then it's able to burn them out, but they do in the wealthy areas.
[01:17:53.913 --> 01:17:56.916]  And so we see a repeat of the perfect conditions.
[01:17:56.956 --> 01:17:59.519]  And that's exactly what's going on here.
[01:17:59.539 --> 01:18:01.341]  The left is using arson.
[01:18:02.022 --> 01:18:02.742]  It's confirmed.
[01:18:02.802 --> 01:18:03.884]  It's all part of their takeover.
[01:18:05.373 --> 01:18:07.155]  On a scale of 1 to 10, them blocking traffic's a 1.
[01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:09.037]  Them burning your house down's a 9.
[01:18:09.098 --> 01:18:11.640]  Cutting your pipelines off is a 5.
[01:18:12.702 --> 01:18:14.824]  This is a war against our industrial civilization.
[01:18:15.145 --> 01:18:16.446]  We need to recognize it and understand it.
[01:18:17.067 --> 01:18:22.954]  While the mainstream corporate media lies to you about what's happening now, we tell you the truth about what's coming next.
[01:18:24.881 --> 01:18:27.303]  And our guest is Eric West.
[01:18:28.084 --> 01:18:39.733]  He's a citizen journalist and a very successful businessman and realtor there in Hawaii, there in Maui, and he lives in Lahaina and is now witnessing what is unfolding there.
[01:18:40.353 --> 01:18:53.423]  We've got so many clips here, but man, the way they're acting suspicious, the way they're putting up, won't give people aid, are trying to keep aid out, people to bring aid by boat, $700 a family while the FEMA's staying in thousands a night plus.
[01:18:54.364 --> 01:18:58.366]  Hotel rooms, but they've got money to put up black curtains around the town.
[01:18:59.426 --> 01:19:02.008]  This looks to me like a giant cover-up.
[01:19:02.048 --> 01:19:04.649]  We have you being thrown out yesterday from your own town.
[01:19:05.689 --> 01:19:09.471]  We have footage of the melted cars with grass all around it, not even burned.
[01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:22.217]  We have all of this insane footage, and then we have them arresting arsonists all over the world that are environmentalists doing this, but corporate media covering it up.
[01:19:23.822 --> 01:19:30.949]  I wish people would behave more like the tribal police at Burning Man than these police.
[01:19:31.650 --> 01:19:34.372]  So I think the best thing to play is Eric West who joins us.
[01:19:35.073 --> 01:19:41.879]  Eric, set this footage up we're about to play of where they're trying to stop you from shooting any footage.
[01:19:43.564 --> 01:19:49.226]  Sure, so basically this is an area that's about two miles from the burn, so quite a ways.
[01:19:49.786 --> 01:20:01.190]  There was a small brush fire around this area and they have set a perimeter up around the burn area with these tight lock, New Zealand tight lock style fences, super high with black dust fence you can't see in.
[01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:10.574]   But now they have these sheriffs that come up to you if you just pull over onto the side of the road for even just a few seconds and they come up and they tell you, hey You can't park here.
[01:20:10.594 --> 01:20:11.155]  You gotta leave.
[01:20:11.355 --> 01:20:12.937]  No photographs, no images.
[01:20:12.997 --> 01:20:22.229]  FEMA even announced they're not gonna allow any photographs or images from the area in respect for the dead, which, you know, everyone's been basically pulverized to death.
[01:20:22.589 --> 01:20:24.852]  I would imagine the dead want the responsible punished.
[01:20:25.193 --> 01:20:26.274]  How dare them use the dead?
[01:20:26.294 --> 01:20:28.417]  How dare them speak for the dead?
[01:20:29.804 --> 01:20:30.304]  It's crazy.
[01:20:30.425 --> 01:20:40.533]  And the fact that the media, I've had many media outlets, Epoch News, mainstream media even, even, you know, KITV here telling me that their media passes, they have to sneak in.
[01:20:40.593 --> 01:20:46.858]  The media is not being allowed into areas of this burn, even at the very inception.
[01:20:46.918 --> 01:20:52.643]  People went back home with their media passes, tucked between their legs because they couldn't get in to where they wanted to go.
[01:20:52.663 --> 01:20:54.685]  Yeah, the answer is everybody needs to land by boat.
[01:20:55.871 --> 01:20:59.699]  And just overwhelm the quote authorities that are the people that are covering this up.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:05.311]  Because they're the very police who work for the system that block people in the town telling you you can't go in.
[01:21:05.812 --> 01:21:07.094]  Massive conflict of interest.
[01:21:08.678 --> 01:21:09.458]  Agreed, agreed.
[01:21:09.618 --> 01:21:14.620]  I just received this text during the commercial break there and I'm just going to put it out there.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.221]  I don't believe there's any accidents, right?
[01:21:16.301 --> 01:21:17.241]  I just don't believe in that.
[01:21:17.281 --> 01:21:22.483]  I believe everything is being orchestrated by forces of good as well to help us in this.
[01:21:22.643 --> 01:21:28.025]  But I just received a text message and again, I'm just going to throw this out there, Alex, but someone just sent me some information.
[01:21:28.045 --> 01:21:32.447]  I'm not going to say the person's name, but he's very, very well known individual.
[01:21:34.244 --> 01:21:40.531]  Saying that this has something to potentially do with Space Force and is possibly an attack.
[01:21:42.252 --> 01:21:52.122]  I'm just going to leave it at that, but I saw... Well, we know that part of Space Force is based in, mainly in Kauai, but also in Maui.
[01:21:52.743 --> 01:21:56.127]  That's kind of a big secret that the Hawaiian Islands are a big giant base.
[01:21:57.349 --> 01:21:58.090]  Correct, correct.
[01:21:58.150 --> 01:22:02.453]  And I'm not going to say it publicly on your show, but later on I'll share who this person just texted me.
[01:22:02.493 --> 01:22:04.115]  But that's a pretty significant development.
[01:22:04.155 --> 01:22:05.696]  The first time I've heard of that concept.
[01:22:06.116 --> 01:22:15.824]  But he said that there will probably be military interaction or intervention at this point in time because this could be an attack from somebody.
[01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:19.087]  I don't know who, but... Well, I mean, I haven't tried to poop who directs energy weapons.
[01:22:19.127 --> 01:22:19.788]  I know they're real.
[01:22:21.010 --> 01:22:35.042]  But the footage you're showing of the trees and grass all fine and cars fried and that they don't want you to show that, that is, and we know the Chinese admittedly a few months ago scanned the islands with a topography laser.
[01:22:35.082 --> 01:22:36.183]  That was on the local news.
[01:22:36.623 --> 01:22:37.684]  This is pretty suspicious.
[01:22:38.705 --> 01:22:40.006]  It is very, very suspicious.
[01:22:40.106 --> 01:22:53.079]   And I think we need to ask the government to allow for just normal media coverage of this because I think The blackout of information is not, is not helpful for people that want to know the truth of what's going on.
[01:22:53.119 --> 01:22:59.364]  So we got to figure out who the enemy is so we can find out what their truest intent is so that we can fight this, we can fight this war.
[01:22:59.424 --> 01:23:05.448]  And my job is to bring you the information because I'm one of the few guys with a star link and a little bit of a YouTube channel.
[01:23:05.468 --> 01:23:08.831]  And I'm going to show you what we're seeing so that you can judge what it is for yourself.
[01:23:11.052 --> 01:23:13.893]  We've asked Elon Musk weeks ago, he says he's trying to, quote, help.
[01:23:14.253 --> 01:23:16.134]  He could deliver 50 Starlings right now.
[01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:19.736]  He could show up and be a hero and set up a media operation there.
[01:23:21.257 --> 01:23:22.057]  I totally agree.
[01:23:22.257 --> 01:23:22.797]  I totally agree.
[01:23:22.837 --> 01:23:24.378]  And what coordinate aid?
[01:23:24.638 --> 01:23:28.380]  Are they still trying to blockade of the locals trying to bring in food and water?
[01:23:30.117 --> 01:23:32.399]  Well, that's a good question.
[01:23:32.419 --> 01:23:44.166]  I think you can now come over from the other side, and all the donations have been from local private groups bringing in food, but there's a major lack of support from FEMA and Red Cross in the normal ways.
[01:23:44.227 --> 01:23:54.693]  I know that they're paying for these hotel rooms, supposedly, but you're not seeing a presence from them in any significant way, and that's every survivor I talk to, I ask them, you know, who's been helping you?
[01:23:55.454 --> 01:23:56.715]  It hasn't been those major organizations.
[01:23:56.735 --> 01:23:59.317]  Yeah, as if aid workers don't want to go to one of the most people places in the world.
[01:24:00.097 --> 01:24:00.637]  And it's the top.
[01:24:00.657 --> 01:24:01.758]  Yeah, there's a cover up.
[01:24:02.058 --> 01:24:03.539]  The system doesn't want people in there.
[01:24:03.559 --> 01:24:05.280]  They're putting up black tarps around it.
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:12.343]  Let's go ahead and roll a few minutes of them trying to keep you from outside the town showing bizarrely barbecued cars.
[01:24:13.363 --> 01:24:13.964]  Yeah, we're out of here.
[01:24:14.104 --> 01:24:14.584]  We're out of here.
[01:24:14.604 --> 01:24:15.444]  Okay.
[01:24:17.905 --> 01:24:18.926]  We're on our way out, sir.
[01:24:19.546 --> 01:24:19.866]  How's it?
[01:24:20.687 --> 01:24:22.628]  No videos or no picture taking.
[01:24:22.648 --> 01:24:22.808]  Yeah.
[01:24:22.948 --> 01:24:23.088]  Okay.
[01:24:23.108 --> 01:24:24.168]  Thanks for your service, by the way.
[01:24:24.188 --> 01:24:24.829]  No problem.
[01:24:24.849 --> 01:24:25.309]  Good looking out.
[01:24:25.914 --> 01:24:26.814]  Okay, we're good.
[01:24:26.834 --> 01:24:27.355]  We leave right now.
[01:24:27.415 --> 01:24:28.175]  We parked over there.
[01:24:28.215 --> 01:24:29.516]  We were told we couldn't park down here.
[01:24:29.856 --> 01:24:31.016]  Yeah, this whole area.
[01:24:31.216 --> 01:24:33.217]  Even down there, no parking.
[01:24:33.517 --> 01:24:34.738]  So no media or nothing, yeah?
[01:24:34.758 --> 01:24:34.838]  No.
[01:24:35.018 --> 01:24:36.219]  You ever seen anything like this before?
[01:24:36.239 --> 01:24:37.679]  Not this bad.
[01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:38.820]  Just open the hood.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:39.940]  You want to see under the seat?
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:40.460]  No, no.
[01:24:40.701 --> 01:24:44.322]  So the question we're just asking is like, how could this hard car get this hot?
[01:24:44.682 --> 01:24:45.243]  With grass.
[01:24:45.263 --> 01:24:46.103]  A little grass fire.
[01:24:46.423 --> 01:24:46.963]  It didn't jump.
[01:24:47.183 --> 01:24:47.684]  It didn't jump.
[01:24:48.204 --> 01:24:49.264]  That grass is good.
[01:24:49.304 --> 01:24:51.025]  There's even a bunch of grass down there that's good.
[01:24:51.045 --> 01:24:52.066]  Yeah, come look under the hood.
[01:24:52.126 --> 01:24:59.296]   How could you melt Dude, this is like Star Wars kind of stuff right here.
[01:24:59.556 --> 01:25:05.487]  Yeah, it's... The windshield, the windshield melted over the shifting, the linkage.
[01:25:05.507 --> 01:25:05.868]  I mean it...
[01:25:08.107 --> 01:25:12.349]  It was like, well, $1,220 for aluminum.
[01:25:13.210 --> 01:25:15.991]  But in the back you can see it liquefied, so that's about $1,500.
[01:25:16.191 --> 01:25:19.053]  How could that thing get hot enough from a little bit of grass?
[01:25:19.613 --> 01:25:22.414]  How could that get so hot on a little bit of grass?
[01:25:22.474 --> 01:25:23.935]  It didn't even burn the grass down there.
[01:25:24.095 --> 01:25:36.024]   In your brain, logically, without knowing any science, nothing about temperatures, you had campfires, how could that melt Aluminum and tires and steel braided brake lines when there's nothing around.
[01:25:36.144 --> 01:25:39.287]  If you could just guess... I don't know man, I wasn't here.
[01:25:39.307 --> 01:25:41.209]  You don't have to be here, just look.
[01:25:41.529 --> 01:25:44.753]  Even if you torch a car, I don't think you can melt aluminum.
[01:25:44.833 --> 01:25:47.916]  If I said I'll give you 10 grand to burn a car like that, what would you need?
[01:25:51.391 --> 01:25:52.291]  I wouldn't even take the money.
[01:25:52.371 --> 01:25:53.472]  You know what I mean?
[01:25:54.532 --> 01:25:56.853]  That's you, Gwen Jo, and me, Gwen Jo.
[01:25:57.453 --> 01:26:00.574]  No, no, but say it's at a tow yard where it's a scrap car.
[01:26:01.195 --> 01:26:08.757]  Not somebody's car, but, you know, like a... What's that show where they do... That's in the Bird Room?
[01:26:09.578 --> 01:26:11.398]  Where they do the experiments.
[01:26:11.559 --> 01:26:13.799]  It's called... where they test everything.
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:15.200]  It's the red-haired guy.
[01:26:16.683 --> 01:26:18.305]  The Red Roof House, that thing's getting famous.
[01:26:18.345 --> 01:26:19.786]  You know what's one I'm talking about?
[01:26:19.826 --> 01:26:24.891]  Where they like, they reenact everything just to prove it wrong or prove it right.
[01:26:24.931 --> 01:26:26.613]  No, no, it's like almost like a comedy show.
[01:26:26.653 --> 01:26:27.334]  It's a redheaded guy.
[01:26:27.354 --> 01:26:31.298]  I mean, I don't want to sound like I'm crazy, but I feel like this is like, well, that's what I meant.
[01:26:31.338 --> 01:26:32.038]  It's like attack.
[01:26:32.218 --> 01:26:33.320]  That's the way I look at stuff.
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:34.661]  It doesn't make any logical sense.
[01:26:35.419 --> 01:26:39.842]  I've got scientists telling me that it's like, this breaks science as we know it.
[01:26:39.902 --> 01:26:43.325]  And this one to me, is the one that really stands out because there's nothing around.
[01:26:43.345 --> 01:26:52.471]  I mean they do like dark guns and they do, it's like, and they show like clips on Hollywood and then they prove it that it's like bullshit.
[01:26:53.431 --> 01:26:54.212]  Oh, the Mythbusters.
[01:26:54.252 --> 01:26:54.992]  Yeah, Mythbusters.
[01:26:55.012 --> 01:26:56.293]  We're gonna get out of here.
[01:26:56.373 --> 01:26:56.953]  We respect you guys.
[01:26:56.973 --> 01:26:58.134]  Thank you for doing your job.
[01:26:58.154 --> 01:27:00.855]  We love the sheriff because you guys are sworn to protect the Constitution.
[01:27:00.935 --> 01:27:01.595]  So thank you.
[01:27:01.715 --> 01:27:04.777]  Thank you for your service, bro.
[01:27:04.817 --> 01:27:05.277]  Thank you, guys.
[01:27:05.337 --> 01:27:05.637]  Thank you.
[01:27:05.677 --> 01:27:05.997]  Aloha.
[01:27:06.017 --> 01:27:06.437]  Thank you.
[01:27:06.457 --> 01:27:07.558]  Alright, thanks, Phillips.
[01:27:07.638 --> 01:27:08.318]  Okay, that's enough.
[01:27:08.939 --> 01:27:11.440]  So they're being very diplomatic with the police, but give me a break.
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:13.381]  They just blocked off both sides of the road.
[01:27:13.401 --> 01:27:14.261]  This whole thing went down.
[01:27:14.561 --> 01:27:17.343]  You're miles outside town, and oh, you're not allowed to show pictures.
[01:27:17.943 --> 01:27:24.805]   Since when in America, miles away from a giant crime scene, where they're putting up black Walls around it.
[01:27:25.325 --> 01:27:27.166]  I mean, this is not America.
[01:27:27.206 --> 01:27:28.107]  This is disgusting.
[01:27:28.507 --> 01:27:31.228]  I want to know who gave the orders to block the town.
[01:27:31.369 --> 01:27:33.009]  I want to know who gave the orders to leave the power on.
[01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:34.370]  Who wouldn't let them have the water?
[01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:35.111]  Well, they already admitted it.
[01:27:35.411 --> 01:27:36.652]  Who didn't turn the sirens on?
[01:27:36.672 --> 01:27:37.612]  Well, the mayor admits it.
[01:27:37.892 --> 01:27:38.673]  The emergency manager.
[01:27:39.113 --> 01:27:39.893]  And then I'm sorry.
[01:27:40.674 --> 01:27:43.055]  We can be nice to police so far, and I know you've got to be there.
[01:27:43.475 --> 01:27:44.276]  You've got to deal with them.
[01:27:45.016 --> 01:27:47.538]  But man, I've got to tell you, Eric West, this is disgusting.
[01:27:49.031 --> 01:27:49.591]  It really is.
[01:27:49.732 --> 01:27:54.315]  And also we have the Chief of Police, who is also the guy from the Vegas shooting.
[01:27:55.055 --> 01:27:57.156]  Also, I think you went to the FBI Academy.
[01:27:57.176 --> 01:28:02.500]  Why is he allowed to be the coroner when that is against the rules, essentially?
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:03.741]  Not essentially.
[01:28:03.761 --> 01:28:08.044]  They passed a law, as you know, that you can't do that just last year.
[01:28:09.758 --> 01:28:10.158]  Exactly.
[01:28:10.198 --> 01:28:14.240]  Why is it that the Emergency Management Director was off island when this happened?
[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:15.320]  Who was his deputy?
[01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:17.120]  And why haven't we heard from his deputy?
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:21.342]  My brother-in-law was the Emergency Management Director for Douglas County for 20 years.
[01:28:21.382 --> 01:28:22.082]  He just retired.
[01:28:22.442 --> 01:28:24.583]  He goes, there's got to be a deputy that's in charge.
[01:28:24.883 --> 01:28:26.823]  Why are we not hearing from those individuals?
[01:28:26.883 --> 01:28:34.726]  Why is it that the mayor gave a press conference on Zoom at 6.30 while half the town had already burned?
[01:28:35.286 --> 01:28:37.268]  And he thinks everything is fine.
[01:28:37.328 --> 01:28:41.032]  Why would the mayor, how would he not know about the fire happening?
[01:28:41.052 --> 01:28:42.754]  They had that Zoom recorded.
[01:28:42.794 --> 01:28:43.935]  You can go watch it yourself.
[01:28:43.975 --> 01:28:45.937]  So there's just... Well, that's my next point.
[01:28:45.958 --> 01:28:52.524]  They manhandle reporters, including yourself and others, at these press conferences where you say, where are the children?
[01:28:52.544 --> 01:28:53.986]  And they go, nah, and then grab you.
[01:28:54.547 --> 01:28:56.509]  I mean, they're acting beyond suspicious.
[01:28:57.816 --> 01:28:58.817]  Yeah, there's no question.
[01:28:58.837 --> 01:29:00.157]  And what did happen to the children?
[01:29:00.197 --> 01:29:01.318]  That's a very good question.
[01:29:01.338 --> 01:29:03.479]  So we have a crime against humanity here.
[01:29:03.879 --> 01:29:06.221]  And my question is, is what's the world going to do about it?
[01:29:06.241 --> 01:29:15.346]  And if we don't start mobilizing as a people and sharing this information with the world, because mainstream media is not reporting the truth.
[01:29:15.766 --> 01:29:29.275]  And it's important for everyone that's listening to this show to go and start sharing what information we are presenting so that we can bring awareness to this thing so it can be tried in the world court, essentially, because that's what it's going to take to move the needle.
[01:29:30.656 --> 01:29:31.176]  Absolutely.
[01:29:32.117 --> 01:29:33.018]  I love Lehna.
[01:29:33.038 --> 01:29:34.378]  I love Maui.
[01:29:34.759 --> 01:29:37.380]  I want to come there, but it could become a circus.
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:41.503]  Obviously, me trying to blend in and just get footage would be pretty obvious.
[01:29:44.795 --> 01:29:53.858]  You know, at the same time, we need more reporters, more journalists to go there and infiltrate and to show where the power lines went down and to show.
[01:29:53.878 --> 01:30:02.940]  But as you mentioned, these fires that popped up around your house the last few days because you're not playing ball and that we're in Antifa that are showing up to threaten other reporters that will be in the middle of the woods.
[01:30:03.541 --> 01:30:08.162]  And they have it like geolocation, like Antifa guys in black shirts are going, what are you doing here?
[01:30:08.182 --> 01:30:08.662]  Get out of here.
[01:30:08.682 --> 01:30:10.663]  I mean, I know the cut of their jib.
[01:30:11.658 --> 01:30:12.599]  I know them when I see them.
[01:30:13.059 --> 01:30:20.983]  They're there that are catching Antifa types all over the world setting fires from Canada to Greece, from California.
[01:30:21.003 --> 01:30:25.626]  They caught a few earlier this year there in Mali catching fires.
[01:30:25.666 --> 01:30:26.546]  This is what they do.
[01:30:26.826 --> 01:30:27.867]  They hate civilization.
[01:30:27.907 --> 01:30:28.767]  They hate the system.
[01:30:29.608 --> 01:30:31.569]  The Black Rocks of the world are also at war with it.
[01:30:31.589 --> 01:30:32.329]  They're funding them.
[01:30:32.729 --> 01:30:36.932]  And I just don't think that there's any denial about what's going here as a citizen.
[01:30:37.312 --> 01:30:40.454]  Not giving your facts, but gut level.
[01:30:41.514 --> 01:30:42.836]  What are you and the locals saying?
[01:30:42.856 --> 01:30:44.938]  Because I already know what you're saying locals are saying when I hear it from you.
[01:30:44.958 --> 01:30:51.305]  Because I've watched the different meetings, the emergency management meetings, the city council meetings, the county meetings.
[01:30:51.886 --> 01:30:54.148]  I mean, I was like, well, is it just one lady, man?
[01:30:54.188 --> 01:30:56.871]  I went and watched a few days ago, like two hours of it.
[01:30:57.532 --> 01:30:59.774]  Every person was in their face seeing through this.
[01:31:01.596 --> 01:31:10.339]  Whatever they thought they were going to get away with here, and whoever ran this, their cover-ups only creating a tug-of-war here, and I think they've jumped the shark.
[01:31:10.439 --> 01:31:18.062]  So, what do you, just as a citizen, as a human, as a resident of that area, as a citizen of Lahaina, what do you think happened?
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:20.320]  I don't know.
[01:31:20.341 --> 01:31:21.742]  I don't know what happened.
[01:31:21.842 --> 01:31:22.884]  But here's what I do know.
[01:31:23.324 --> 01:31:25.347]  This is a call to the world.
[01:31:25.387 --> 01:31:46.966]   This is an awakening and this is an opportunity for us to bring so much awareness to the situation that whoever they are, whatever forces behind this, and I don't know, But I think the more awareness that we can bring, this is our opportunity to stop it and to create an awakening around the planet to help because this is an international issue.
[01:31:47.006 --> 01:31:50.327]  I've got people calling me from all these different countries, scientists.
[01:31:50.347 --> 01:31:57.110]   This is a colossal Problem with the environment and what's going to happen with all these chemicals?
[01:31:57.430 --> 01:32:02.253]  How do we protect these people from from from what they're being exposed to right now?
[01:32:02.653 --> 01:32:04.455]  Normal protocols are not being met.
[01:32:04.515 --> 01:32:05.895]  So I don't know who it is.
[01:32:05.995 --> 01:32:06.936]  I don't know how it happened.
[01:32:06.976 --> 01:32:33.895]   But what I do know is with awareness and with spreading the message that we can possibly stop this plan and it can be the beginning of the end for the enemy and it can be the beginning of a new awakening for our world and I believe this is the siren call for This is a call to action for communities of people in the world, not just our country, not just Hawaii, but for everybody to start paying attention and waking up, which you've been trying to do for a long time.
[01:32:34.275 --> 01:32:37.758]  I believe this is the chance, and we do it for the children.
[01:32:38.058 --> 01:32:39.439]  We do it for the children.
[01:32:39.719 --> 01:32:50.743]  If you won't do it for the children, if you won't do it for Maui, what we call paradise, if you won't step up and defend this, you're not going to defend it when it comes to Kansas.
[01:32:50.763 --> 01:32:55.045]  You're not going to defend it when it comes to some small town and some rural place that no one cares about.
[01:32:55.325 --> 01:32:59.947]  If you won't step up and help Maui, if you won't do it for this place, guess what?
[01:33:00.347 --> 01:33:01.547]  They're going to take everything.
[01:33:03.788 --> 01:33:04.068]  All right.
[01:33:04.889 --> 01:33:11.038]   I asked you before you went live with us, I said, "Oh, they're trying to blockade. I looked you up.
[01:33:11.038 --> 01:33:12.239]  You're a trusted guy in the community.
[01:33:12.239 --> 01:33:15.198]   Everything about you is nice." So when I see some big viral thing, I go, "Well,
[01:33:15.198 --> 01:33:19.759]   let's look that guy's name up." Long history, everybody loves you. Everybody loves fish.
[01:33:19.759 --> 01:33:23.038]   And it turns out everything you said weeks ago turned out to be dead accurate
[01:33:23.038 --> 01:33:24.878]  from your perspective. It was worse than what you thought.
[01:33:24.878 --> 01:33:28.719]  And I said, "How do I support?"
[01:33:28.954 --> 01:33:31.334]  And he said, well, you know, they're attacking me.
[01:33:31.394 --> 01:33:34.255]  They're coming after me because I'm trying to get support and get media and I get support.
[01:33:35.055 --> 01:33:39.557]  And he said, I don't know how far I want to go with this, but you know, we want to try to raise money for him and I'm going to get more attacked.
[01:33:40.117 --> 01:33:42.797]  Imagine good people that live there.
[01:33:42.817 --> 01:33:44.318]  You got a house, you're kicked out of it.
[01:33:45.058 --> 01:33:46.478]  You're living on the edge of town.
[01:33:46.498 --> 01:33:47.699]  The police won't even let you in.
[01:33:48.826 --> 01:33:51.307]  And then you're kind of like, well, I'm a local, I want to help him.
[01:33:51.347 --> 01:33:56.689]  I mean, I had to convince Fish, you know, who's basically homeless now, to try to raise a little money for him.
[01:33:57.310 --> 01:33:58.670]  But yeah, we've kind of got a plan.
[01:33:58.710 --> 01:34:04.232]  We'd like to directly, if good people don't raise the money, who will know we'll deliver it all?
[01:34:04.793 --> 01:34:05.433]  Nobody is.
[01:34:05.473 --> 01:34:14.414]   So I want to play a clip of you yesterday, and then what looks like, I'll be honest, He's not a regular fireman.
[01:34:14.474 --> 01:34:16.997]  I know he can fly over and doesn't get grass, but burns cars.
[01:34:17.157 --> 01:34:18.879]  This does not look normal.
[01:34:19.299 --> 01:34:24.565]  We know they've got microwave weapons, not lasers, but microwaves that will do this to cars.
[01:34:24.966 --> 01:34:26.528]  Pentagon's had it for at least 70 years.
[01:34:27.068 --> 01:34:28.670]  Yeah, they've had it right up to World War II.
[01:34:29.131 --> 01:34:30.933]  And they had it perfected by the 90s.
[01:34:31.694 --> 01:34:32.494]  And I'll leave it at that.
[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:36.682]  Because I know people very close to me that worked in those weapon systems.
[01:34:36.702 --> 01:34:41.206]  They didn't give me the classified info, but they just said, if you think lasers are powerful, you ought to see what microwaves do.
[01:34:41.226 --> 01:34:43.448]  On that note, Alex, I had a gentleman call me yesterday.
[01:34:43.488 --> 01:34:50.947]   I know Alex, I had a gentleman call me yesterday, in 1972 he helped install a microwave unit on a KC-135
[01:34:50.947 --> 01:34:58.087]   and he said they were flying at 50,000 feet over Vietnam and they were able to take out Jeep radars
[01:34:58.087 --> 01:35:02.686]  in a small Jeep with a microwave device in 1972.
[01:35:02.686 --> 01:35:07.807]   And he said, Eric, I had to sign all kinds of papers and say I wouldn't say a word until the late 80s.
[01:35:07.807 --> 01:35:12.128]   But if they were doing that in 1972, I mean, I'd never heard of it honestly,
[01:35:12.128 --> 01:35:15.208]  but imagine what the technology can do today.
[01:35:15.208 --> 01:35:19.408]   Well, he's dead now so I can talk about it, but right before, he was a tough guy.
[01:35:19.408 --> 01:35:23.527]   Raymond Teague was like, ran the main mission for the cameras on the moon, all that.
[01:35:23.527 --> 01:35:27.328]   He was Air Force intelligence, a whole bunch of tours in Vietnam.
[01:35:27.328 --> 01:35:29.728]  And he was a tough guy.
[01:35:28.908 --> 01:35:29.949]  He died like two weeks later.
[01:35:29.969 --> 01:35:32.171]  He used to work for me actually for about five, six years.
[01:35:32.892 --> 01:35:37.756]  But he would never tell me, he had like presidential letters on his wall from, from like, you know, Nixon and stuff.
[01:35:38.297 --> 01:35:41.339]  He headed up like main mission controls, like one of the main bosses.
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:44.783]  And he said, well, my heart's going, I'll probably be dead in a few months.
[01:35:45.703 --> 01:35:49.507]  But I just want to, I don't tell you everything, but he said the space program was real, but we're not showing you everything.
[01:35:49.527 --> 01:35:51.769]  And you ought to see the stuff we had in Vietnam.
[01:35:52.970 --> 01:35:54.491]  The microwave weapons, all of it.
[01:35:54.951 --> 01:35:57.092]  And he just basically told me a whole bunch of stuff about that.
[01:35:57.512 --> 01:35:59.493]  And then I was like, okay, Raymond, well, I had a good hamburger.
[01:35:59.553 --> 01:35:59.953]  I'll see you.
[01:35:59.973 --> 01:36:01.994]  And like, I was at his funeral three weeks later.
[01:36:02.835 --> 01:36:05.876]  I wish I'd have pumped him more because I'm just sitting there eating a hamburger and drinking a beer.
[01:36:05.916 --> 01:36:07.857]  You know, he's a really smart, funny guy.
[01:36:07.917 --> 01:36:09.958]  One of my, became one of my dad's best friends.
[01:36:10.318 --> 01:36:11.839]  He and my dad used to go hunting all the time.
[01:36:12.279 --> 01:36:14.420]  I'm talking like a month out of the year, those guys hung out.
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:16.821]  He was also from East Texas, close where my dad came from.
[01:36:16.841 --> 01:36:21.323]  But he told me so much stuff, basically similar things that he said.
[01:36:21.963 --> 01:36:25.564]  What you see in space is basically fake because they're not showing you what they really got.
[01:36:26.325 --> 01:36:31.046]  So when I hear space lasers, it's easier to think, well, power lines fall down, which we know some did.
[01:36:31.086 --> 01:36:32.267]  But then I see the other footage.
[01:36:32.727 --> 01:36:33.807]  I know that stuff's real.
[01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:40.070]  I think, well, like you said, space is hard to send the main beam through because it hits water vapor.
[01:36:40.090 --> 01:36:42.951]  There's like 10 feet of water in the first 15,000 feet in the atmosphere.
[01:36:43.391 --> 01:36:44.772]  So that laser's got to cook through that.
[01:36:45.672 --> 01:36:53.879]   But In C-130s, or even in smaller aircraft, they've got lasers and microwaves now that will blow a car up in seconds.
[01:36:54.359 --> 01:36:56.340]  You hit that car with it, the car explodes.
[01:36:57.121 --> 01:36:58.561]  The battery, everything sets on fire.
[01:36:59.782 --> 01:37:02.023]  And yeah, there's a whole lineup of them right there.
[01:37:02.663 --> 01:37:09.167]  So, and it turns out that Maui is the second largest base of these in the world, or for the United States.
[01:37:09.247 --> 01:37:11.688]  So, they don't need pilots to take off now.
[01:37:11.728 --> 01:37:13.749]  They've got drone-operated, any aircraft.
[01:37:14.645 --> 01:37:16.526]  And so they can just give them an order, they go up.
[01:37:16.566 --> 01:37:22.729]  And I'm not saying it happened, but we should be looking at the FAA records and others or independent radar of what was in the air.
[01:37:22.969 --> 01:37:30.012]  Because if there were some big aircraft circling right before this started, then that's where we need to look.
[01:37:30.613 --> 01:37:33.374]  So all these sleuths know how to track Elon Musk, where he flies and stuff.
[01:37:33.734 --> 01:37:36.095]  Folks, let's use that same technology to track what was there.
[01:37:36.395 --> 01:37:39.737]  Let's play a few minutes of you with the burnout cars.
[01:37:40.538 --> 01:37:45.842]  La Haina Luna High School in the neighborhood that did not, I repeat, did not burn.
[01:37:46.262 --> 01:37:49.865]  You can see all these houses are standing around here, unburned.
[01:37:50.786 --> 01:37:52.047]  There's no burn here, okay?
[01:37:52.247 --> 01:38:00.173]  So to me, this is like something out of a space movie because you have this small field with some grass that burned, right?
[01:38:00.193 --> 01:38:01.434]  You can see where the grass burned.
[01:38:02.839 --> 01:38:08.221]  But then you have these two vehicles sitting in here that have melted aluminum.
[01:38:08.241 --> 01:38:10.822]  So Donovan, if you want to just take us through this car real quick and show us.
[01:38:10.862 --> 01:38:12.183]  I know you know a few things about cars.
[01:38:12.203 --> 01:38:15.584]  You can point out some things that require a very high temperature.
[01:38:15.624 --> 01:38:25.367]  By the way, we just talked to the neighbor who was talking to an investigator in Lahainatown yesterday, and he said the investigator told him the temperature's reached in excess of 3,000 degrees.
[01:38:25.888 --> 01:38:26.968]  So tell us what you got, Donovan.
[01:38:27.608 --> 01:38:30.850]  Well, we have about 300 degrees for aluminum.
[01:38:34.138 --> 01:38:34.659]  Three hundred?
[01:38:34.839 --> 01:38:36.480]  Thirteen hundred.
[01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:45.647]  Well, twelve twenty, but if you round it up, because it was not only melted, it was liquefied to the point where it became a river of aluminum going down the dirt hill.
[01:38:45.707 --> 01:38:48.069]  So this is the aluminum rim, obviously.
[01:38:48.109 --> 01:38:52.172]  There's the tire, what's left of it, the steel threads or steel belts.
[01:38:52.573 --> 01:38:55.255]  And maybe a combination gas tank if the gas tank's aluminum.
[01:38:55.715 --> 01:38:56.356]  Okay, okay.
[01:38:56.376 --> 01:39:00.659]  So you have liquefied aluminum running down the side of a grass fire.
[01:39:00.779 --> 01:39:09.859]   The caliper melted, unless they stole it, but it looks like the bolts are still there.
[01:39:09.859 --> 01:39:15.939]   And then you get the steel belt of the tire, which is just a bunch of wire mesh laying
[01:39:15.939 --> 01:39:21.338]   there and you have the windows that were melted, the back window, if you look at the big old
[01:39:21.338 --> 01:39:23.859]  like almost like...
[01:39:23.859 --> 01:39:24.859]  The glass is just melted.
[01:39:24.859 --> 01:39:28.298]   Tell you what sir, if you can do a few more minutes with us, maybe five minutes the next
[01:39:28.298 --> 01:39:32.019]   hour we'll be able to finish up, but before any further, what are the best charities to
[01:39:32.019 --> 01:39:34.939]  give to that are actually getting stuff to folks?
[01:39:34.939 --> 01:39:38.538]   And I know you're stepping up to do it as well, because people are challenging you to.
[01:39:38.538 --> 01:39:40.099]  How do we get aid to people right now?
[01:39:40.099 --> 01:39:50.099]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:39:41.704 --> 01:39:46.327]  Well, we've started a GoFundMe called Lahainafirefund.com.
[01:39:46.487 --> 01:39:49.129]  It's part of our organization called Maui LFG.
[01:39:49.369 --> 01:39:57.574]  LFG stands for Let's Find the Gap, Let's Fill the Gap, Let's F and Go, because we've been mobilized to find areas of need.
[01:39:57.634 --> 01:39:58.495]  And so you can give to us.
[01:39:58.955 --> 01:40:03.416]  We are going to give every penny back to people that are affected by this fire.
[01:40:03.436 --> 01:40:05.477]  We're going to give it $10,000 at a time.
[01:40:05.797 --> 01:40:08.318]  We're going to catch that on camera and help people with $10,000, $10,000, $10,000.
[01:40:09.298 --> 01:40:14.719]  And then on top of that, we're going to share their Venmo, their GoFundMe.
[01:40:15.059 --> 01:40:20.401]  So we're seeding them with $10,000 and then hoping that people will continue to give to them directly.
[01:40:20.421 --> 01:40:26.022]  Because the feds are sending $700 and trying to keep everybody out so they don't get aid, so they can be forced to sell.
[01:40:26.082 --> 01:40:27.323]  It's very clear what's happening.
[01:40:27.563 --> 01:40:28.463]  This is so obvious.
[01:40:28.683 --> 01:40:30.024]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:40:30.044 --> 01:40:32.645]  They're choking off the people of Lahaina.
[01:40:32.685 --> 01:40:35.687]  They're hoping that they'll all leave, and they'll have to.
[01:40:35.707 --> 01:40:40.829]  And if you want to talk about a land grab, the only land grab I'm seeing here is the banks, right?
[01:40:41.009 --> 01:40:44.251]  All of these properties are basically, most of them are mortgaged.
[01:40:44.611 --> 01:40:52.575]  So, if they have to make their payments for the next two to three years, taxes... Hold on, do more time and explain this, but we're going to put the URL up.
[01:40:53.015 --> 01:40:54.415]  Slowly give it to everybody.
[01:40:54.816 --> 01:40:56.076]  Where do people go to give donations?
[01:40:56.096 --> 01:41:07.601]  They go right to the people, so the locals like you can stabilize it and not have the globalists come in and the hundred billionaires, that's conservative, that are in the area trying to steal the land, that drove up the prices, they're trying to force them out.
[01:41:07.962 --> 01:41:08.642]  Where do people donate?
[01:41:09.710 --> 01:41:11.731]  LahainaFireFund.com.
[01:41:12.031 --> 01:41:15.093]  LahainaFireFund.com.
[01:41:15.513 --> 01:41:17.354]  Alright, we're gonna go to break.
[01:41:17.734 --> 01:41:18.854]  How much more time can you do?
[01:41:20.255 --> 01:41:21.496]  As much time as you need, Alex.
[01:41:21.916 --> 01:41:23.377]  Alright, I got other big guests.
[01:41:23.397 --> 01:41:24.537]  Stu Peters is on top of this.
[01:41:24.577 --> 01:41:24.977]  He's coming up.
[01:41:25.017 --> 01:41:26.238]  Let's do 15 more minutes.
[01:41:26.738 --> 01:41:27.739]  Stu Peters is coming on.
[01:41:28.159 --> 01:41:29.620]  Folks, this is big time.
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:30.800]  This is obvious.
[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:32.521]  This is choreographed destruction.
[01:41:32.941 --> 01:41:33.702]  Choreographed.
[01:41:34.302 --> 01:41:36.003]  You don't perfectly mess up this bet.
[01:41:36.423 --> 01:41:43.289]  Okay, this was precision-operated, and I am now thinking direct energy was used, because I had not seen what the locals had shot.
[01:41:43.489 --> 01:41:44.190]  There's no way.
[01:41:44.650 --> 01:41:48.173]  This is, this is, this is, and the cover-up just adds to it.
[01:41:48.234 --> 01:41:49.315]  These people are sick.
[01:41:49.695 --> 01:41:51.136]  But the drones can do this.
[01:41:51.156 --> 01:41:53.138]  They don't need Air Force officers to do this anymore.
[01:41:53.558 --> 01:41:54.239]  We're going to go to break, sir.
[01:41:54.259 --> 01:41:54.919]  We'll be right back to you.
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:58.962]  Please remember, we're listed as supported for this mothership that supports everybody else.
[01:41:59.363 --> 01:42:00.423]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:42:00.784 --> 01:42:03.205]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula, the strongest turmeric out there.
[01:42:03.225 --> 01:42:05.667]  95% cucuraminoid, back in stock.
[01:42:05.907 --> 01:42:07.128]  Sold out for almost seven, eight months.
[01:42:07.528 --> 01:42:08.248]  It was like eight months.
[01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:10.370]  It's back at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:42:11.130 --> 01:42:12.071]  So many other great products.
[01:42:12.091 --> 01:42:14.072]  Superfemale Vitality, Supermales sold out.
[01:42:14.473 --> 01:42:15.794]  Superfemale's the same formula, folks.
[01:42:15.814 --> 01:42:16.454]  It's the pink label.
[01:42:17.114 --> 01:42:17.595]  60% off.
[01:42:17.975 --> 01:42:19.276]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:42:19.896 --> 01:42:22.558]  And it's a flash sale for X3 and Vitamin Refusion.
[01:42:22.578 --> 01:42:23.699]  They're selling out in the next few days.
[01:42:24.079 --> 01:42:24.599]  They're still 40% off.
[01:42:26.261 --> 01:42:27.142]  Back in two minutes.
[01:42:28.304 --> 01:42:29.005]  Eric, take a break.
[01:42:29.426 --> 01:42:30.748]  We'll come right back to you in two minutes.
[01:42:31.168 --> 01:42:33.168]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:42:33.168 --> 01:42:47.168]  [Music]
[01:42:47.168 --> 01:42:52.168]   I've studied how the globalists, how the mad scientists are controlling us.
[01:42:52.446 --> 01:42:54.988]  And they're doing it by keeping us undernourished.
[01:42:55.588 --> 01:43:08.457]  You can eat all the food you want in the world, but if you don't have the essential vitamins and minerals in an organic, absorbable form, if you don't have the key elements like iodine, you are literally like someone in a paddle boat without oars.
[01:43:09.197 --> 01:43:09.818]  Without paddles.
[01:43:10.658 --> 01:43:21.345]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running a flash sale, because we're about to sell out of both of these, of X3 and Vitaminal Fusion in the final days of August.
[01:43:21.365 --> 01:43:24.893]   This is a fundraiser I've been shadowbanned.
[01:43:24.793 --> 01:43:29.932]   I could sell it at full price, but I want those of you that have been on the fence and never tried x3
[01:43:29.932 --> 01:43:34.513]   Or never tried by mineral fusion to take action and try this product because I know
[01:43:34.513 --> 01:43:40.212]   You're going to be blown away by the energy the stamina the focus the libido
[01:43:40.212 --> 01:43:47.012]   This is so critical get your x3 if I mineral fusion for 40% off right now and then for store.com
[01:43:47.012 --> 01:43:54.533]   I've been shadowbanned. I've been called a liar I've been silenced on virtually every platform created by
[01:43:54.533 --> 01:43:55.012]  man.
[01:43:55.601 --> 01:43:57.922]  My life has been threatened, repeatedly.
[01:43:58.522 --> 01:44:01.103]  They've tried to destroy me, but I survived.
[01:44:02.623 --> 01:44:04.683]  And that's why I'm joining Mug Club.
[01:44:06.204 --> 01:44:08.724]  The re-platforming begins now!
[01:44:08.925 --> 01:44:18.287]  Join Mug Club and get one month free with promo code ALEX at jonescrowder.com Imagine!
[01:44:20.836 --> 01:44:31.869]  A good-sized town, almost no aid being given, local aid being blocked, and giant black fences being put up around the entire area.
[01:44:32.670 --> 01:44:37.416]  Miles away, citizens kicked out, told by police not to film.
[01:44:38.337 --> 01:44:39.999]  Hawaii never became a really free state.
[01:44:41.365 --> 01:44:42.266]  I'm sad that the U.S.
[01:44:42.286 --> 01:44:42.786]  took it over.
[01:44:42.846 --> 01:44:43.826]  What happened there was wrong.
[01:44:44.627 --> 01:44:46.568]  But you go there, it's beyond the territory.
[01:44:46.688 --> 01:44:48.409]  The police do not think you have any rights.
[01:44:48.949 --> 01:45:01.216]  The people are amazing, but I get that our guest, Eric West, was polite to him when he's two miles outside, he has a house there, he's filming on a hilltop, and they say, you can't film the town from two miles away.
[01:45:03.629 --> 01:45:05.670]  Just like, oh, you're not supposed to question elections.
[01:45:06.071 --> 01:45:07.712]  They just did an African election.
[01:45:07.732 --> 01:45:12.114]  I went to cover yesterday where they wouldn't allow poll watchers as much as the UN wanted.
[01:45:12.355 --> 01:45:13.615]  So they say it's not a free election.
[01:45:15.637 --> 01:45:17.938]  The essence of a cover up is a cover up.
[01:45:19.259 --> 01:45:21.580]  And this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:45:22.001 --> 01:45:23.782]  Eric West, you've got to join us again soon.
[01:45:23.842 --> 01:45:24.442]  Get fish on.
[01:45:24.462 --> 01:45:36.483]   I know you've been out of contact with the last day or so because he's homeless now, but We'll get a hold of him as soon as possible, get him on, but we just want to talk to him because he's a really great guy.
[01:45:36.843 --> 01:45:37.324]  So are you.
[01:45:37.344 --> 01:45:38.965]  We've got four minutes to break.
[01:45:39.046 --> 01:45:40.928]  What else do you want to impart to viewers and listeners?
[01:45:43.161 --> 01:45:54.092]  What I'd like to impart to viewers and listeners is number one, I believe we need to have a day of mourning here on Maui, in the world essentially, so that we can kind of get a reset.
[01:45:54.572 --> 01:45:59.938]  That's a normal procedure that the people of Hawaii have not been really given the opportunity to do.
[01:45:59.978 --> 01:46:04.422]  They just seem to forget that hundreds, maybe thousands of people died.
[01:46:05.106 --> 01:46:06.208]  That's very, very important.
[01:46:06.248 --> 01:46:11.056]  We have to have that mourning and we have to allow these people to do what they would do.
[01:46:11.076 --> 01:46:13.219]  And we didn't know who died.
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:17.527]  So you talk about what is the best dead reckoning we've got on the real death toll.
[01:46:19.648 --> 01:46:28.896]  I mean, I've heard that it's 100 and change, I believe, and they've reduced the list to 338, I believe, that they believe are missing.
[01:46:28.936 --> 01:46:34.740]  But it's very, very, very mysterious, and why they wouldn't just do a census at every neighborhood.
[01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:38.023]  They've got these people, these guardsmen, that are posted.
[01:46:38.083 --> 01:46:39.324]  They have a sign-in sheet.
[01:46:39.344 --> 01:46:42.547]  I mean, it would be so easy, I believe, to do that.
[01:46:42.947 --> 01:46:48.909]  But the fact that they've not allowed homeowners or business owners to return to their property.
[01:46:48.969 --> 01:46:54.350]  So it's been complete communication blackout and a complete physical blackout.
[01:46:54.370 --> 01:46:58.051]  Just like when they locked down all over the world where the West is in control.
[01:46:58.572 --> 01:47:04.273]  People couldn't see their loved ones while they had tubes stuck down their throats to kill them with ventilators.
[01:47:04.613 --> 01:47:05.694]  You couldn't see your family.
[01:47:05.974 --> 01:47:06.674]  Same story again.
[01:47:07.452 --> 01:47:09.273]  Yeah, you can't go pay your last respects.
[01:47:09.333 --> 01:47:13.217]  You can't go look for your melted fire safe.
[01:47:13.337 --> 01:47:13.937]  You cannot.
[01:47:14.498 --> 01:47:23.985]  There's a complete authoritarian control happening here and they just more government officials are piling in every single day and we're crying out to the American public.
[01:47:24.005 --> 01:47:26.467]  We're crying out to the world to take action.
[01:47:26.627 --> 01:47:29.869]  You know, this is not quarter, you know, armchair quarterback time.
[01:47:30.189 --> 01:47:33.371]  It's not just guys like you that have been telling the truth for years.
[01:47:33.671 --> 01:47:36.032]  It's time for people to mobilize and do something.
[01:47:36.052 --> 01:47:37.533]  This is a call to action.
[01:47:40.034 --> 01:47:41.755]  People need to spread the word with your videos.
[01:47:41.775 --> 01:47:43.656]  They need to pray for folks.
[01:47:43.716 --> 01:47:46.618]  They need to support financially because we're next.
[01:47:46.678 --> 01:47:52.621]  This model of controlled choreographed destruction is the future if we don't stop it.
[01:47:53.260 --> 01:47:54.902]  Right, this is the canary in the cage.
[01:47:55.022 --> 01:48:00.448]  If you can't see what this is, this is just not so blatantly obvious that you're asleep and you'll probably remain asleep.
[01:48:00.708 --> 01:48:07.235]  But for those of you that are woken, have been, are awake and are waking up to what's going on, it's time to take action.
[01:48:07.255 --> 01:48:09.797]   It's time to actually Become a digital warrior.
[01:48:09.837 --> 01:48:11.617]  It's time to reach out to your politicians.
[01:48:11.898 --> 01:48:16.420]  It's time to do whatever it is that God calls you to do.
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:22.783]  This is a call to action, and I truly believe there's something going on here that's way bigger than we can even fathom.
[01:48:23.043 --> 01:48:30.386]   But it comes down to we the people, and we the people need to start acting Like, the home of the free and the home of the land of the brave.
[01:48:30.626 --> 01:48:36.168]  We need to start acting like Americans and start doing something instead of just, you know, scrolling or whatever.
[01:48:36.248 --> 01:48:39.030]  We need to mobilize people to action.
[01:48:40.230 --> 01:48:47.933]  All right, final segment with Eric West, local investigative journalist, businessman, and then Stu Peters.
[01:48:48.553 --> 01:48:49.894]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:48:49.934 --> 01:48:50.414]  Stay with us.
[01:48:50.434 --> 01:48:57.177]  All right, we got 10 minutes in this segment, then I'm gonna hit some other breaking news and bring in Stu Peters, who's always informative.
[01:48:58.106 --> 01:49:05.848]  Eric West is a business owner, lives in Lahaina, blocked out of his house, black tarp being put up around the whole town, massive cover-up.
[01:49:06.489 --> 01:49:08.929]  I want you to have the floor to cover other angles and other issues.
[01:49:08.989 --> 01:49:11.870]  I'm going to put a little bit more of your direct energy weapon piece that's gone viral.
[01:49:12.770 --> 01:49:14.391]  But let me get back to the question I asked you earlier.
[01:49:14.411 --> 01:49:17.672]  You elaborated some, but I want you to really go deep dive on this for a few minutes.
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:20.680]  What are the different jurisdictions?
[01:49:20.821 --> 01:49:28.444]  I'm just seeing different clips at different council meetings where I go to the raw footage and man, nobody's buying it from what I've seen.
[01:49:29.504 --> 01:49:30.684]  What are the locals saying?
[01:49:30.844 --> 01:49:32.045]  What is their consensus?
[01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:33.706]  Because I mean, I know what their consensus is.
[01:49:34.026 --> 01:49:36.407]  This is a coordinated operation.
[01:49:36.427 --> 01:49:37.527]  They were set up.
[01:49:37.887 --> 01:49:38.808]  You're not letting aid in.
[01:49:38.868 --> 01:49:39.988]  You're covering something up.
[01:49:40.948 --> 01:49:41.729]  Where are the children?
[01:49:43.163 --> 01:49:46.544]  Are the locals buying it on a scale of one to ten or one of a hundred?
[01:49:46.564 --> 01:49:50.286]  A hundred percent, none of them are asleep.
[01:49:50.606 --> 01:49:51.566]  They're all awake.
[01:49:51.586 --> 01:49:52.927]  Zero percent, nobody's awake.
[01:49:53.347 --> 01:49:54.387]  What's the percentage right now?
[01:49:56.448 --> 01:49:58.529]  Yeah, that's a very good question, Alex.
[01:49:58.829 --> 01:50:06.071]  I saw a news clip the other day asking, you know, where is the outcry from the local Hawaiians or from the people that live here?
[01:50:06.091 --> 01:50:11.282]   Because it seems to be I think it's a situation where it's like a bomb just went off, right?
[01:50:11.342 --> 01:50:18.107]  I mean it's literally we are in survival mode and we're also devastated and they don't have anything.
[01:50:18.167 --> 01:50:22.064]   So imagine the majority of the people that live here They don't have anything.
[01:50:22.144 --> 01:50:25.666]  They don't have a possession, so it's hard to kind of fathom.
[01:50:25.706 --> 01:50:32.008]  So I think they're mainly just shell-shocked, but they don't really... They're in a state of confusion.
[01:50:32.048 --> 01:50:33.829]  They're trying to get resources.
[01:50:33.869 --> 01:50:39.471]  They're being told to go here and do this, go to this website, and you don't have any internet connection, right?
[01:50:39.491 --> 01:50:42.672]  So it's like... So basically, you'll own nothing, and you'll like it.
[01:50:44.537 --> 01:50:52.402]  Correct, but it's like you live in a... the people watching this or listening to this, you live in a paradigm of you have access to the necessities.
[01:50:52.422 --> 01:50:54.264]  You have access to an internet or a phone.
[01:50:54.524 --> 01:50:57.526]  These people have access to nothing and they're just displaced.
[01:50:57.606 --> 01:51:02.089]  So you're talking about... So they're like the Japanese after bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[01:51:03.717 --> 01:51:09.339]  Correct, and it's a very remote part of the island, so the rest of the island is a 35-40 minute drive.
[01:51:09.359 --> 01:51:13.680]  They've got easy control points to let people in and out, which you can flow freely now.
[01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:19.102]  For those who don't know, you've got big skyscrapers, huge hotels, malls, everything.
[01:51:19.502 --> 01:51:24.363]  This is a rural, original seat of the Lion Roll family, a whaling town.
[01:51:24.403 --> 01:51:26.364]  This is where the blue-collar folks live.
[01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:31.335]  Yeah, well, the people whose homes burned are definitely the blue collar.
[01:51:31.395 --> 01:51:35.622]  I mean, it's the lowest end of society, not of society, but as far as real estate.
[01:51:35.642 --> 01:51:38.406]  But then all the billionaires, their houses are all green right around there.
[01:51:39.912 --> 01:51:44.256]  Yeah, with blue roofs, but there is this blue thing going on, don't quite understand.
[01:51:44.276 --> 01:51:53.884]  Matter of fact, that clip you just showed of the sheriff, the sheriff was showing me a clip on his phone of a car that was red in the middle of destruction, and the red car was perfect.
[01:51:53.944 --> 01:51:59.649]  It was this classic car, and he was zooming up on the melted, little bit of melted taillight.
[01:52:00.010 --> 01:52:02.052]  But why is this red car perfectly fine?
[01:52:02.072 --> 01:52:05.054]  Yes, they're saying certain colors the microwaves bounce off of.
[01:52:05.094 --> 01:52:06.756]  Is that, that's what I've been hearing.
[01:52:07.512 --> 01:52:08.633]  I guess so, yeah.
[01:52:08.753 --> 01:52:15.478]  But the other thing that's interesting, Alex, is we are less than 100 miles from Oahu, one of the biggest military installations in the world.
[01:52:15.818 --> 01:52:19.081]  Marine, Air Force, Army, all kinds of equipment.
[01:52:19.961 --> 01:52:20.901]  They didn't show up.
[01:52:21.242 --> 01:52:34.688]  Why is it that there's been very little interaction from such an amazing resource just to... Well, I was about to say, we can blame the Chinese all day for direct energy weapons, and I'm not saying they aren't involved, but I would, the U.S.
[01:52:34.728 --> 01:52:43.212]  government's the one that keeps testing biologicals on us, and with the drones they've got, you could have one globalist give the order and send up drone aircraft and do this.
[01:52:44.568 --> 01:52:44.868]  Correct.
[01:52:45.028 --> 01:52:47.030]  And why is there such a minimal response?
[01:52:47.070 --> 01:52:54.455]  They had multiple Chinook helicopters here for the little three-acre brush fire of the day with alarms, with sirens, with text messages.
[01:52:55.115 --> 01:52:56.436]  Where were they the day of the fire?
[01:52:56.476 --> 01:53:01.039]  This thing started early in the morning and burned all night long.
[01:53:01.139 --> 01:53:01.760]  And let's go back.
[01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:10.386]  We have the head of the Water District, we played the video, who's on the Obama Foundation saying, we denied them water even when the fire, that day they denied it.
[01:53:13.598 --> 01:53:17.161]  Yeah, I think they were just trying to dip into a water reservoir.
[01:53:18.523 --> 01:53:19.804]  Talk about that for people that don't know.
[01:53:21.806 --> 01:53:27.311]  So again, they spin everything in a way that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but basically the water was shut off.
[01:53:27.532 --> 01:53:28.933]  Now forget about water rights.
[01:53:29.453 --> 01:53:31.856]  Nothing was coming out of the spigots or the hoses, okay?
[01:53:32.196 --> 01:53:35.860]  Funny, you had a burned down building and blue shirts are just fine.
[01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:37.942]  Now I'm starting to think something's going on now.
[01:53:39.858 --> 01:53:42.821]  For folks who don't know, light only hits certain things.
[01:53:42.841 --> 01:53:53.331]  So they always said, like, a spaceship that wants to be anti-laser, or a continental ballistic missile with MIRV technology, when it pops open, about to launch missiles into the atmosphere, you know, launches from Russia over the North Pole.
[01:53:54.457 --> 01:54:03.645]  It's still in space, MIRV opens up, launches 24 warheads, 12 Udmer decoys, 12 warheads, but they would jacket them in glass so that lasers would bounce off.
[01:54:04.466 --> 01:54:09.690]  So I know that's basic technology, but why are you in burned out buildings with blue shirts laying there totally fine?
[01:54:12.933 --> 01:54:14.094]  And people are showing it, see?
[01:54:14.574 --> 01:54:14.774]  See?
[01:54:15.215 --> 01:54:17.817]  Look, look, look, it doesn't hurt it.
[01:54:22.526 --> 01:54:24.487]  And anybody knows this has played around with lasers.
[01:54:24.607 --> 01:54:31.309]  I have as well, just here in the office having fun years ago with a little joke with Lego toys, vaporizing them with a cheap $100 laser.
[01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:40.973]  A black piece would melt immediately, but a white piece, white reflects light, so does baby blue, wouldn't burn.
[01:54:41.774 --> 01:54:43.754]  So, show that footage again.
[01:54:44.615 --> 01:54:45.195]  Sorry, go ahead, sir.
[01:54:48.923 --> 01:54:50.325]  You wanna say anything about this, Eric West?
[01:54:50.145 --> 01:54:56.585]   Oh yeah, I knew less about lasers than anybody, so I just found those blue shirts.
[01:54:56.585 --> 01:54:59.744]   By the way, they're being returned to the owner of that store.
[01:54:59.744 --> 01:55:03.584]   I think they need to be submitted for testing for any kind of accelerants,
[01:55:03.584 --> 01:55:09.225]   but essentially we have all kinds of weird blue things that didn't get burned and some blue tiled roofs
[01:55:10.189 --> 01:55:13.853]  But we're showing blue fabric isn't burned by a laser.
[01:55:14.234 --> 01:55:15.075]  Everything else is.
[01:55:15.376 --> 01:55:16.577]  White barely burns.
[01:55:16.877 --> 01:55:17.859]  Blue won't burn.
[01:55:18.179 --> 01:55:20.002]  Everything else burns because it's absorbing it.
[01:55:21.604 --> 01:55:25.486]  You also have trees that are perfectly fine next to buildings.
[01:55:25.886 --> 01:55:31.889]  And I've got so many people that have reached out to me from the Paradise Fire, from Malibu, from the Camp Fire.
[01:55:31.929 --> 01:55:35.290]  They're saying, we saw the exact same phenomenon.
[01:55:35.370 --> 01:55:36.511]  It's just, here's the problem.
[01:55:37.111 --> 01:55:40.653]  Nobody seems to listen or believe this seems too crazy or outlandish.
[01:55:40.753 --> 01:55:43.974]  But if you don't listen to this, it's going to be in your backyard.
[01:55:44.695 --> 01:55:45.895]  This is just the beginning.
[01:55:45.995 --> 01:55:47.256]  So we take a stand now.
[01:55:47.296 --> 01:55:48.997]  We draw a line in the sand now.
[01:55:50.652 --> 01:55:52.473]  Or they're just going to keep being successful.
[01:55:52.513 --> 01:55:53.894]  Whoever they is, I don't know.
[01:55:54.014 --> 01:55:55.255]  And how they did it, I don't know.
[01:55:55.315 --> 01:55:59.117]  But we do know there's enough gut feeling here.
[01:55:59.137 --> 01:56:03.260]  There's enough fishy stuff going on that Fish was nice enough to point out.
[01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:07.622]  And everything he said has been corroborated by other individuals that it's time to take action.
[01:56:08.663 --> 01:56:09.884]  Well, don't you remember?
[01:56:09.904 --> 01:56:14.667]  I mean, there's been so many examples of this.
[01:56:16.075 --> 01:56:21.977]  Man, the left's being caught everywhere setting fires, and I figure it's arsonists and them not turning the power lines off.
[01:56:22.217 --> 01:56:30.280]  I think that was part of it, but I think they probably did use some directed energy from what I've seen now, and then they used the power lines as the fallback story.
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:31.440]  I think they were part of it.
[01:56:33.441 --> 01:56:33.741]  I agree.
[01:56:33.761 --> 01:56:37.482]  There's a lot of misdirection, a lot of misinformation.
[01:56:37.782 --> 01:56:39.243]  You know, you're a real estate agent.
[01:56:39.583 --> 01:56:42.964]  That's the second most expensive real estate in the world because everybody wants it.
[01:56:44.212 --> 01:56:46.153]  What is it, like thousands of dollars per square inch?
[01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:56.925]  I mean, a very old home built in the 70s, three bedroom, two bath, you know, cinder block construction would be, you know, $800,000, $900,000.
[01:56:57.445 --> 01:57:01.508]  So the average home price on Maui is $1.2 million.
[01:57:02.148 --> 01:57:07.991]  But yeah, certainly the stuff that was burned on Front Street, I mean, my goodness, that is some of the most expensive real estate.
[01:57:08.472 --> 01:57:11.914]  And some would say that it's the best spot in all of Hawaii.
[01:57:11.954 --> 01:57:16.136]  This is where the royalty chose to vacation during the Hawaiian Kingdom.
[01:57:16.176 --> 01:57:17.137]  This was their capital.
[01:57:17.617 --> 01:57:20.619]  You could say this is the heart of Haiti.
[01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:22.700]  Wow.
[01:57:23.020 --> 01:57:26.903]  Well, if they wanted us to just buy their official story, it's not happening.
[01:57:27.603 --> 01:57:29.624]  As sad as this is for the dead, we should mourn them.
[01:57:29.644 --> 01:57:32.886]  And it helps, obviously, they're on the way, not from the government.
[01:57:33.467 --> 01:57:35.528]  This is definitely blowing up in the system's face.
[01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.851]  I agree.
[01:57:38.991 --> 01:57:42.675]  And it's time to move the needle on the media because the media is not getting access.
[01:57:42.715 --> 01:57:44.577]  So all we have left is we the people.
[01:57:44.617 --> 01:57:52.486]  All we have left is platforms and sharing and you being a digital warrior, going all night long until your fingers bleed.
[01:57:52.967 --> 01:57:53.507]  Do things.
[01:57:53.587 --> 01:57:55.249]  I think this is a call to action.
[01:57:55.289 --> 01:57:58.233]  This isn't just something you watch from afar and go, oh, how interesting.
[01:57:58.553 --> 01:58:03.837]  You do something, whatever it is, say a prayer, and ask God, what are you to do?
[01:58:03.917 --> 01:58:08.160]  Because the battle is here, it's now, it's happening, and we need to mobilize.
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:11.122]  We can take on Maui, it's this little place in the middle of nowhere.
[01:58:11.442 --> 01:58:11.923]  Guess what?
[01:58:12.283 --> 01:58:19.208]  This is United States soil, and if you're a patriot, it's time to do whatever it is that God is calling and asking you to do.
[01:58:20.492 --> 01:58:21.372]  All right, powerful.
[01:58:21.432 --> 01:58:23.914]  Eric, join us again in the next few days.
[01:58:23.974 --> 01:58:24.754]  You name the time.
[01:58:25.414 --> 01:58:27.095]  Eric West, thank you so much.
[01:58:27.735 --> 01:58:29.036]  Wow, very impressive.
[01:58:29.576 --> 01:58:31.617]  HawaiiRealEstate.org is his main site.
[01:58:31.657 --> 01:58:32.077]  Check it out.
[01:58:32.117 --> 01:58:32.938]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:58:34.038 --> 01:58:39.000]  On March 20th, 2003, the United States invaded Iraq.
[01:58:39.020 --> 01:58:43.683]  Exactly one year before the invasion, Alex Jones predicted it.
[01:58:44.283 --> 01:58:47.024]  So now everybody's going, wow, it really was the Iraqis.
[01:58:47.044 --> 01:58:48.805]  That's just because they're getting ready to invade Iraq.
[01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:50.931]  What a beautiful setup!
[01:58:51.311 --> 01:58:57.415]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:58:57.735 --> 01:59:02.335]   Visit info wars.com forward slash show and share the link today
[01:59:02.335 --> 01:59:16.934]   All right, Eric West is a local line of resident there in Maui Hawaii a fellow American and
[01:59:17.782 --> 01:59:19.042]  And he's got a lot of work to do.
[01:59:19.062 --> 01:59:20.423]  We've really held him over here.
[01:59:20.443 --> 01:59:22.003]  He's got to get back to relief efforts.
[01:59:22.043 --> 01:59:27.205]  But you're talking to conservatively three or four million people right now watching.
[01:59:27.705 --> 01:59:29.006]  Millions will watch later.
[01:59:29.106 --> 01:59:30.266]  People are going to share this everywhere.
[01:59:30.286 --> 01:59:31.006]  They do a great job.
[01:59:31.046 --> 01:59:33.147]  We salute the viewers and listeners who do that.
[01:59:33.207 --> 01:59:36.008]  They're really not the tail of the dog.
[01:59:36.028 --> 01:59:36.948]  They're the whole damn dog.
[01:59:37.328 --> 01:59:39.229]  So the dog hunts when they decide to take action.
[01:59:40.259 --> 01:59:41.659]  We salute them and thank them.
[01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:43.920]  Because we're not going down without a fight here.
[01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:46.261]  But imagine all the people watching and listening.
[01:59:46.681 --> 01:59:47.861]  Recap the key.
[01:59:48.581 --> 01:59:49.681]  Anything else you didn't cover.
[01:59:49.701 --> 01:59:53.282]  As if you just now joined us, this message is going out.
[01:59:53.522 --> 01:59:55.543]  You're in front of 4 million people, conservatively.
[01:59:56.523 --> 01:59:58.124]  Right now, what do you want to say to them?
[01:59:58.944 --> 01:59:59.384]  Eric West.
[02:00:01.380 --> 02:00:04.705]  Here's what I have to say to the American people and people watching around the world.
[02:00:04.745 --> 02:00:07.589]  We have a colossal event that's occurred here.
[02:00:07.609 --> 02:00:09.612]  An unprecedented Black Swan event.
[02:00:09.773 --> 02:00:12.256]  It's obvious that something nefarious is afoot.
[02:00:12.296 --> 02:00:13.498]  We don't know exactly how.
[02:00:14.508 --> 02:00:15.048]  Or why?
[02:00:15.248 --> 02:00:16.149]  But we have our theories.
[02:00:16.729 --> 02:00:20.130]  Ultimately, your show, Alex, is about info wars.
[02:00:20.210 --> 02:00:21.651]  And this is an information war.
[02:00:21.691 --> 02:00:23.551]  The media has been kept out of this.
[02:00:24.011 --> 02:00:27.893]  We have a temporary flight restriction that's been in place since this started.
[02:00:27.913 --> 02:00:29.553]  There's no reason we can't fly drones.
[02:00:29.593 --> 02:00:31.194]  We cannot access, we cannot take photos.
[02:00:31.814 --> 02:00:36.896]  The information about this event is being withheld from the American people.
[02:00:37.496 --> 02:00:43.040]  And so what I'm able to provide, I had the first Starlink on the ground through my YouTube channel, Hawaii Real Estate Org.
[02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:44.801]  I am bringing you the truth.
[02:00:45.281 --> 02:00:46.822]  Not the truth, I'm bringing you the information.
[02:00:47.223 --> 02:00:53.007]  You can interpret what you're seeing through what I'm showing on Hawaii Real Estate Org website.
[02:00:53.307 --> 02:00:54.768]  Our purpose is to fill the gap.
[02:00:55.068 --> 02:00:57.630]  We have an organization called Maui LFG.
[02:00:57.670 --> 02:00:58.270]  Let's fill the gap.
[02:00:58.290 --> 02:00:58.991]  Let's find the gap.
[02:00:59.051 --> 02:00:59.871]  Let's fill the gap.
[02:01:00.131 --> 02:01:07.016]  Let's effing go, which is let's figure out what's going on here and then fill the gap so that it doesn't happen again in the future.
[02:01:07.396 --> 02:01:18.239]  We have so many colossal errors that occurred that killed hundreds, if not thousands of people, many of them children, in the most beautiful spot on planet Earth, potentially, when you come to vacation.
[02:01:18.539 --> 02:01:27.001]  So the question is, if you won't take a stand for this, if you won't draw a line in the sand for this, then what will it take before they end up in your backyard?
[02:01:27.061 --> 02:01:27.921]  You've got to help now.
[02:01:27.981 --> 02:01:33.022]  You've got to go to war on your phones, in the digital realm, to help us.
[02:01:34.110 --> 02:01:36.231]  The guy with the blower just showed up of course.
[02:01:36.751 --> 02:01:37.751]  But you've got to help Maui.
[02:01:37.771 --> 02:01:41.433]  You've got to help us here because this is a world issue.
[02:01:41.493 --> 02:01:42.593]  A world crisis.
[02:01:43.113 --> 02:01:46.294]  And we can't let them get away with whatever it is we're trying to do.
[02:01:46.654 --> 02:01:48.595]  We need to call the World Court.
[02:01:49.059 --> 02:01:54.980]  We're not trying to get clicks, we're trying to get a change happening in this world so that they don't take over, whoever they are.
[02:01:54.900 --> 02:01:59.619]   ask the good people that will help make this situation turn around for the good
[02:01:59.619 --> 02:02:04.419]   so we can find out what's going on here. We're not trying to get clicks, we're
[02:02:04.419 --> 02:02:09.540]   trying to get a change happening in this world so that they don't take over
[02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:15.459]   whoever they are. I just encourage everybody to pray to God, to ask for help on what to do.
[02:02:15.459 --> 02:02:22.140]   I totally agree, but let me just ask you, did you hear that or is that on our feed?
[02:02:20.328 --> 02:02:23.569]  Because it sounds like Godzilla just attacked.
[02:02:24.409 --> 02:02:27.950]  No, you did a great job laying that out, it just sounded like all hell was breaking loose.
[02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:30.311]  Closing 60 second comment.
[02:02:31.431 --> 02:02:38.265]   Closing 60 second comment, please go to MauiLFG.org Support what's going on in Maui.
[02:02:38.705 --> 02:02:41.746]  Register yourself as a resource on that website if you can help.
[02:02:41.906 --> 02:02:57.009]  Besides donating money to Lahainafirefund.com and digital warriors out there, patriots, citizens of the world, it's important that right now you mobilize to get the word out because there's a complete ultimate media blackout and we just need to share what's actually going on here on Maui.
[02:02:57.029 --> 02:03:03.070]  This is important not just for us but for you because they're coming, whoever they are, for your land next.
[02:03:04.708 --> 02:03:06.449]  All right, Eric West, thank you so much.
[02:03:06.529 --> 02:03:08.811]  Please get back on the show in the next few days, give us updates.
[02:03:08.851 --> 02:03:09.311]  Thank you, sir.
[02:03:09.992 --> 02:03:10.792]  Okay, thank you.
[02:03:10.812 --> 02:03:11.433]  I appreciate it.
[02:03:11.853 --> 02:03:14.135]  Wow, that was beyond powerful.
[02:03:17.137 --> 02:03:19.399]  All right, I did major preparation for today's show.
[02:03:19.439 --> 02:03:21.640]  I probably covered five of the 30 stacks I've got.
[02:03:22.301 --> 02:03:23.001]  Let's not exaggerate.
[02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:32.820]   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 stacks.
[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:40.820]  So I've covered five, five of 25 stacks.
[02:03:41.014 --> 02:03:42.695]  And Stu Peters is always loaded for bear.
[02:03:43.375 --> 02:03:44.596]  He's about to take over here.
[02:03:45.796 --> 02:03:47.857]  And give us the latest on everything going down.
[02:03:48.877 --> 02:03:55.340]  We got Ukraine drones target Russian civilians in psychological terror with help from the West, The Economist reports.
[02:03:57.481 --> 02:04:00.062]  Russian appeals to Ukraine soldiers to counter offensive.
[02:04:00.082 --> 02:04:00.983]  This is your last chance.
[02:04:02.984 --> 02:04:06.926]  Hungarian President tells Zelensky it's time to sit down and negotiate, so is NATO.
[02:04:08.847 --> 02:04:13.930]  Zelensky's willing to hold elections, but only the West pays for it.
[02:04:15.571 --> 02:04:20.033]  We've got massive harassment of Amish in Pennsylvania and other areas.
[02:04:20.713 --> 02:04:31.610]   So while they give illegal aliens $10,000 a month in New York, In other states, they're harassing Amish that feed themselves, saying, you're not FDA approved to feed yourself milk and food.
[02:04:31.970 --> 02:04:33.330]  We're taking your family over.
[02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:34.270]  We're taking your land.
[02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:36.031]  It's so predatory.
[02:04:36.511 --> 02:04:37.331]  Government overreach.
[02:04:37.391 --> 02:04:42.572]  Virginia Amish farmer livelihood on the line following government raid and seizure of property.
[02:04:42.792 --> 02:04:45.693]  They can't have the Amish not having autism or live until they're 90.
[02:04:46.753 --> 02:04:48.594]  They can't have them not live enough.
[02:04:48.634 --> 02:04:50.614]  They gotta have them dead too and shut down.
[02:04:50.694 --> 02:04:53.335]  They're too obvious that what they're doing is the answer.
[02:04:53.755 --> 02:04:55.716]  That's why they didn't get everybody to take the shot.
[02:04:55.736 --> 02:04:59.617]  Because if you had enough people didn't take it, you'd have a control group that wasn't sick.
[02:04:59.817 --> 02:05:00.397]  Well guess what?
[02:05:00.597 --> 02:05:02.558]  About 40% of us didn't take it!
[02:05:03.838 --> 02:05:08.260]  And almost no one's buying the next rollout of your garbage!
[02:05:09.502 --> 02:05:11.022]  And we caught you with your pants down!
[02:05:11.783 --> 02:05:20.485]  And now California admits we're going back to COVID rollouts and their official website, masks, contact tracing, vaccine passports, lockdowns.
[02:05:21.286 --> 02:05:23.146]  And they're so pissed we learned about it!
[02:05:23.366 --> 02:05:25.187]  They're so pissed we're saying no!
[02:05:25.207 --> 02:05:30.288]  Well, they're gonna get more pissed as we don't follow anything they say.
[02:05:30.948 --> 02:05:35.590]  They've dissolved our borders, they're cutting off our energy, they're attacking us at every level.
[02:05:37.671 --> 02:05:43.678]  But Larry Fink thinks he's God, and the Rothschilds don't even think they're God, and they're not God.
[02:05:44.218 --> 02:05:57.473]  Because once we identify that they're the ones behind all this, it's game over, and I'm telling you, it's on record that BlackRock owns that power utility, 96% of it, and it's on record everybody's waking up, and that's a microcosm.
[02:05:58.154 --> 02:05:59.856]  You think you're going to corner the people in Lahaina?
[02:05:59.876 --> 02:06:06.523]  You think you're going to corner the people in Texas the last two years where you cut the power off in the winter and wouldn't let us up the power during the storms?
[02:06:06.904 --> 02:06:08.245]  You think we don't know it's you?
[02:06:10.387 --> 02:06:11.287]  We do know it's you.
[02:06:11.307 --> 02:06:14.108]  So you try to indict Trump till the cows come home.
[02:06:14.388 --> 02:06:15.688]  You try to intimidate us.
[02:06:15.929 --> 02:06:17.429]  You try to shut me down.
[02:06:17.709 --> 02:06:19.209]  You try to silence us.
[02:06:19.850 --> 02:06:23.571]  We are not going to be silenced, you blood-sucking arsonist.
[02:06:24.031 --> 02:06:28.372]  And it didn't just left us 79 of them caught in Greece setting the giant fires.
[02:06:28.772 --> 02:06:30.273]  They're cultural arsonists!
[02:06:30.613 --> 02:06:32.694]  They're scum from the bottom up!
[02:06:32.974 --> 02:06:41.299]  And just like at the Burning Man, with the travel police running over those blockades that blocked the road, that's where we're going with you people!
[02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:43.441]  Total resistance!
[02:06:44.421 --> 02:06:45.061]  Woo!
[02:06:45.742 --> 02:06:47.203]  Stu Peters is our guest!
[02:06:47.523 --> 02:06:49.444]  Straight ahead, stay with us!
[02:06:50.825 --> 02:06:57.529]  The left doesn't just block highways, or derail trains, or burn down food processing centers.
[02:06:58.595 --> 02:06:59.916]  They wait till the high winds come.
[02:06:59.956 --> 02:07:01.457]  They get their orders from Blackrock.
[02:07:02.878 --> 02:07:05.179]  And then they show up and they burn down your neighborhood.
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:12.945]  But they mess with the Tribal Council in Nevada and they ran them over when they refused to bring it down.
[02:07:14.446 --> 02:07:15.786]  They ran over their garbage.
[02:07:17.388 --> 02:07:22.511]  Whereas in London, England and places like Germany, they defend them and support them.
[02:07:22.971 --> 02:07:24.812]  They're all funded by the big oil companies.
[02:07:25.453 --> 02:07:27.875]  Oh, it's the oil companies actually financing the whole carbon tax.
[02:07:28.948 --> 02:07:31.429]  Alright, we're going full Stu Peters right now.
[02:07:31.449 --> 02:07:33.831]  And I'll say this.
[02:07:34.591 --> 02:07:36.532]  When I'm wrong, I'm wrong, and I'm the first to admit it.
[02:07:37.893 --> 02:07:50.679]  When I saw them cut the water, leave the power on, not trim the trees, turn off the sirens, curl everybody into Lahaina, 20 days ago now, I said, hey, it's open and shut, it's Black Rock, they did it.
[02:07:50.859 --> 02:07:51.540]  And that was part of it.
[02:07:52.452 --> 02:08:01.195]  But now I've seen the footage of locals, as Stu Peters was right, green grass, trees everywhere, cars, hundreds of yards away from any fire, they're all melted, they're destroyed.
[02:08:01.715 --> 02:08:07.397]  And I know they've got, not lasers, but microwaves that are mainly fired from planes.
[02:08:07.897 --> 02:08:10.078]  Because microwaves don't shoot through the atmosphere from space.
[02:08:10.558 --> 02:08:13.959]  There's 10 feet of water on average, up to 15,000 feet, can't get through it.
[02:08:14.559 --> 02:08:15.500]  Lasers are great in space.
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:18.141]  When a missile comes up out of the atmosphere, you can shoot them there.
[02:08:18.961 --> 02:08:20.982]  Lasers in atmosphere only go 20, 30 miles.
[02:08:23.442 --> 02:08:28.726]  I've looked at the studies, but microwaves and particle beams can go further, but they're on aircraft.
[02:08:28.826 --> 02:08:41.955]  And when the globalists can take any plane, a DC-10, a 747, a 777, a Cessna, and they can mount, depending on the size of the aircraft, lasers that can fire and fire and fire.
[02:08:42.853 --> 02:08:45.514]  So, turns out Maui's the second largest U.S.
[02:08:45.614 --> 02:08:47.934]  base, other than Area 51, for these.
[02:08:48.934 --> 02:08:49.895]  And I've looked at the damage.
[02:08:50.055 --> 02:08:53.635]  It does look like, in some areas, direct-to-energy weapons.
[02:08:53.655 --> 02:08:56.196]  They were gonna do the fallback and blame their own power lines.
[02:08:56.776 --> 02:09:03.878]  So I gotta say, Stu Peters has been at the tip of the spear on this situation.
[02:09:04.867 --> 02:09:09.790]  And there's so much more to cover with him right now.
[02:09:10.591 --> 02:09:13.592]  But Stu Peters, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:09:15.093 --> 02:09:16.434]  Yeah, you're exactly right.
[02:09:16.995 --> 02:09:20.877]  This is becoming more and more obvious every day.
[02:09:21.437 --> 02:09:22.798]  These people don't just hate you.
[02:09:23.198 --> 02:09:37.737]   They have told you that they want the complete annihilation and the destruction of You know, any form of constitutional republic, or if you want to use the stupid word, democracy, this is not friendly to people at BlackRock.
[02:09:38.157 --> 02:09:51.407]  This is not friendly to the one-world governance, the less than one percenters that want the complete destruction of the nuclear family, they want unfettered sexual access to your children, they want the elite to have all of the property that they want to have, and they will control you.
[02:09:51.507 --> 02:09:52.608]  And this is all part of it.
[02:09:52.628 --> 02:10:03.737]   They are willing to murder innocent children who are trapped inside of their homes, With no schools open, with no alarms or signals sounding at all.
[02:10:04.277 --> 02:10:11.261]  Keep in mind, ironically, this is the most advanced signal alarm system that we have in the entire country.
[02:10:11.321 --> 02:10:13.282]  This is a freaking island state.
[02:10:13.988 --> 02:10:15.829]  Okay, and so yeah, they absolutely went in there.
[02:10:15.849 --> 02:10:25.475]  And by the way, Alex, they don't try to, like, disguise the fact or even lie about... The Empire of Lies, imagine that, doesn't even try to lie about the fact that they have these direct energy weapons.
[02:10:25.615 --> 02:10:26.756]  They don't try to hide it.
[02:10:26.776 --> 02:10:27.957]  They actually boast about it.
[02:10:27.977 --> 02:10:38.643]  They have articles all over the place bragging about the military technology that can cook children in some sand country after Toby Keith cheers on one of Pfizer butt slut Lindsey Graham's new wars.
[02:10:39.804 --> 02:10:41.045]  And they're doing it to us.
[02:10:41.585 --> 02:10:59.850]   So putting you in the hospital Uh, putting you, you know, in a state of perpetual fear and forcing you to take your grandmother or aunt or uncle or little baby sister into the hospital because she has this little cough and a common cold and the next thing you know she's being sedated with, you know, a cocktail of drugs that's big enough to kill a horse the size of Fanny Willis.
[02:11:00.510 --> 02:11:16.185]  And then put you, you know, on remdesivir, a poisonous drug that was kicked out of an African Ebola trial, and then strap you onto a ventilator, life support, and kill you for cash, murder you for money if you don't get injected with a bioweapon that was unleashed by our DOD after being manufactured and designed right here at Fort Detrick in our country.
[02:11:16.226 --> 02:11:36.418]   If that's not enough, they have now shown you that they will physically go to war with you and nuke you and kill you for your property And to destroy the nuclear family and to destroy freedom in this country and to overtake this country to usher in a one-world governance so that you are a hundred percent dependent on the agenda of those at BlackRock and Klaus Schwab.
[02:11:36.999 --> 02:11:39.080]  This was a military-style attack.
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:42.241]  Our government has openly declared war on its people.
[02:11:42.341 --> 02:11:42.721]  Period.
[02:11:44.102 --> 02:11:52.442]   Well, we saw them in California in the last 10 years not trim the trees around power lines in poor areas knowing that would cause Down power lines.
[02:11:52.482 --> 02:11:53.663]  So we know they did that there.
[02:11:53.683 --> 02:11:55.325]  And it's a combo of all of them.
[02:11:55.365 --> 02:12:03.794]  But when I look at the footage that we had reporters on that showed it, of a hundred yards from a burned house, the trees and grass aren't burned, and the cars are all fried.
[02:12:03.814 --> 02:12:06.517]  Isn't it kind of reminiscent?
[02:12:06.557 --> 02:12:08.279]  That was not done by ambient heat.
[02:12:09.133 --> 02:12:17.916]  Yeah, doesn't it kind of remind you, how eerily similar are those images of those ash-ridden cars as what we saw on 9-11?
[02:12:17.936 --> 02:12:21.997]  Yeah, guys, Google burnout cars after you show them the laser test.
[02:12:22.998 --> 02:12:26.139]  You look at it, stuff miles away from the World Trade Center.
[02:12:26.159 --> 02:12:29.360]  Yeah, this is one of their big jets with a laser in it.
[02:12:29.380 --> 02:12:31.541]  You can fly around all day and just vaporize stuff.
[02:12:31.661 --> 02:12:33.421]  The whole length of the plane's a laser.
[02:12:33.641 --> 02:12:34.402]  It's a chemical laser.
[02:12:34.422 --> 02:12:35.402]  It can fire all day long.
[02:12:36.735 --> 02:12:41.116]  And you look at 9-11, just pulverized, just zapped cars everywhere.
[02:12:42.777 --> 02:12:51.079]  But all of the landscape, all of the beautiful landscape, everything blue, even t-shirts, blue t-shirts, survived this attack.
[02:12:51.139 --> 02:12:54.460]  Yeah, for those who didn't see it last hour, try to find that, guys, for people who weren't tuned in.
[02:12:55.601 --> 02:13:01.382]  Our reporter went into houses, burned to the ground, and blue t-shirts are laying there totally fine.
[02:13:02.423 --> 02:13:03.423]  Totally untouched.
[02:13:04.102 --> 02:13:09.124]  Yeah, so, you know, I mean, I guess we're going to be talking to our roofer here about putting a blue roof.
[02:13:09.204 --> 02:13:13.926]  I don't know what color Oprah would recommend, but what shade of blue, but we're wearing a blue sports jacket.
[02:13:13.946 --> 02:13:14.626]  You're going to be fine.
[02:13:15.547 --> 02:13:18.668]  Yeah, this is this is the state of our country.
[02:13:18.688 --> 02:13:20.088]  By the way, I've done laser tests.
[02:13:20.148 --> 02:13:20.809]  I've been thinking about it.
[02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:22.049]  I used to joke around.
[02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:25.490]  We did like a Lego laser thing when Star Wars came out like 15 years ago again.
[02:13:26.231 --> 02:13:28.091]  And Darth Vader would burn with a laser.
[02:13:28.131 --> 02:13:28.652]  He's black.
[02:13:29.292 --> 02:13:31.853]  But if you shot something blue or white, the laser doesn't do it.
[02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:34.911]  We got to have a common ground.
[02:13:35.511 --> 02:13:45.058]  And you know, to talk about what you went into break during the last segment I was listening, you're 100% dead on about resistance, 100% resistance against a murderous regime that wants to kill you.
[02:13:45.438 --> 02:13:46.639]  They've told you that they want to kill you.
[02:13:46.959 --> 02:13:48.300]  They've told you they want to bang your kids.
[02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:50.902]  They're going to do it if you don't stand up and stop it.
[02:13:50.922 --> 02:13:54.524]  So we have to find a common ground because right now we're so polarized and so divided.
[02:13:55.957 --> 02:14:11.201]  As per, by the way, the very successfully run multiple psychological operations that are being carried out by our own intelligence apparatus, which is not supposed to carry out intelligence exercises against American people, but they absolutely are, total lawlessness, 100% absence of the rule of law.
[02:14:11.301 --> 02:14:13.802]  And so what we have to have right now is a common ground.
[02:14:13.842 --> 02:14:18.943]   If people did not learn from Scandemic One This is coming back.
[02:14:19.104 --> 02:14:20.464]  We warned that it would come back.
[02:14:20.964 --> 02:14:22.565]  AJ's been warning it was going to come back.
[02:14:23.005 --> 02:14:25.005]  We've been warning on the Stu Peters Network it's going to come back.
[02:14:25.105 --> 02:14:29.567]  So many other people who understand what this actually was have been warning that it's going to come back.
[02:14:29.607 --> 02:14:38.009]  But we have this population of complacent and compliant and apathetic and weak and easily programmable victims.
[02:14:37.829 --> 02:14:44.109]   victims as Americans in our society, that being able to actually resist and what that
[02:14:44.109 --> 02:14:48.909]   looks like is going to be so heavily dependent on whether or not we're going to have a group
[02:14:48.909 --> 02:14:53.248]   of people who really trust what their government and their TV tells them to do, or if they
[02:14:53.248 --> 02:14:56.048]   are going to understand, because I think a lot of them get it, Alex.
[02:14:56.048 --> 02:15:00.649]   I think that there's no doubt that so many people, you cannot look at what happened on
[02:15:01.429 --> 02:15:20.296]  You can't look at what was happening now in Ukraine, or what happened in Afghanistan, or in Syria, or in Iraq, or in Libya, or what's happening right now in Maui, or what happened with the injections, and all of these people dying suddenly, and what happened with the military, and Millie, and the purge, and transgenderism, and the freak shows marching into your schools and grooming your children.
[02:15:20.676 --> 02:15:26.097]  Nobody that is sane can actually step back, take a look at this, and realize, not realize, that they're not after us.
[02:15:26.498 --> 02:15:30.512]   And so the resistance Actually planning what that looks like?
[02:15:31.253 --> 02:15:33.095]  I mean, that's the steps that we need to talk about.
[02:15:33.135 --> 02:15:35.417]  We need to talk about it.
[02:15:35.797 --> 02:15:36.318]  Let's talk about it.
[02:15:36.338 --> 02:15:36.999]  You're totally right.
[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:41.063]  They couldn't do this without drones and robot control.
[02:15:42.744 --> 02:15:47.950]  So now because all the heart attacks for the airline pilots and blood clots, we're talking about going, we're going to skip this break.
[02:15:48.902 --> 02:15:52.365]  They're now talking about AI running all the aircraft.
[02:15:52.925 --> 02:15:55.308]  And so people think, oh, our military wouldn't do this to us.
[02:15:55.948 --> 02:16:01.733]  They just, the biggest jet to the smallest plane can be retrofitted in hours to be remote controlled.
[02:16:02.534 --> 02:16:07.898]  So this lets the globalists do this very easily, and no one even knows because of compartmentalization.
[02:16:08.319 --> 02:16:10.661]  That's why robot armies are so dangerous.
[02:16:12.422 --> 02:16:14.204]  Robot armies are extremely dangerous.
[02:16:14.944 --> 02:16:16.706]  And that's what we have infesting us right now.
[02:16:17.327 --> 02:16:19.769]  We've talked about the nanotechnology that they want to use.
[02:16:19.809 --> 02:16:27.155]  Elon Musk, who's revered as the savior of free speech, wants to put a chip in your brain to control your thoughts, actions, and predict whether or not you're going to commit crimes.
[02:16:27.195 --> 02:16:29.377]  But look, this is exactly what you get right here.
[02:16:29.998 --> 02:16:35.783]  This is what happens when the elite want something that they know that you would not willingly give them.
[02:16:36.503 --> 02:16:37.985]  This is complete annihilation.
[02:16:38.045 --> 02:16:38.885]  Look at those cars.
[02:16:39.025 --> 02:16:49.988]   The only thing left, blue t-shirts, blue anything, This was a targeted attack on Americans because these people who wanted what they had knew that they would not willingly give it away.
[02:16:50.548 --> 02:16:52.169]  What else won't you willingly give away?
[02:16:52.670 --> 02:16:53.831]  Your bodily autonomy.
[02:16:54.131 --> 02:16:55.291]  You won't give away your freedom.
[02:16:55.732 --> 02:16:56.973]  You won't give away the right- Again, look right here!
[02:16:57.473 --> 02:16:59.294]  All the cars are burned but a blue car!
[02:17:00.575 --> 02:17:00.795]  Look!
[02:17:01.616 --> 02:17:03.337]  It's a blue car not burned right there!
[02:17:06.823 --> 02:17:07.183]  There it is.
[02:17:07.504 --> 02:17:08.184]  You can't make it up.
[02:17:08.405 --> 02:17:10.106]  Now, I don't know if that car got there before him.
[02:17:10.186 --> 02:17:11.047]  I could have just pulled in.
[02:17:11.107 --> 02:17:15.451]  Guys, show the footage, because I was thinking back, like, 15 years ago, a new Star Wars movie came out.
[02:17:15.772 --> 02:17:16.552]  Go ask Rob, dude.
[02:17:16.592 --> 02:17:18.815]  We shot the video where the studio is now.
[02:17:19.275 --> 02:17:21.037]  Go get our little stupid Star Wars video.
[02:17:21.057 --> 02:17:23.859]  We only got like a half million views on YouTube, but I bought...
[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:26.221]  A few hundred dollar lasers online.
[02:17:26.681 --> 02:17:28.462]  And I said, let's do our own Star Wars video.
[02:17:28.782 --> 02:17:32.144]  So we set up all these Star Wars toys up, and we noticed that they were white or blue.
[02:17:32.264 --> 02:17:33.745]  White would burn, but took a long time.
[02:17:34.105 --> 02:17:35.085]  Blue wouldn't burn.
[02:17:35.445 --> 02:17:39.107]  Black or brown, because they absorb the laser, would explode into flames.
[02:17:40.128 --> 02:17:45.951]  And now they've got footage of blue, baby blue won't burn, but every other color burns.
[02:17:46.391 --> 02:17:47.331]  Just like our test.
[02:17:47.371 --> 02:17:49.833]  So I guess that lends credibility to what you're saying.
[02:17:50.313 --> 02:17:51.634]  Guys, you showed it last hour.
[02:17:51.674 --> 02:17:52.194]  Show that footage.
[02:17:53.860 --> 02:17:59.981]  So a targeted attack from the government on people who want to keep their right to vote, keep their right to have the government redress their grievances.
[02:18:00.001 --> 02:18:03.242]  We saw what happened to that on January 6th.
[02:18:03.982 --> 02:18:07.163]  To take away every single individual liberty that you have and to take your kids.
[02:18:07.183 --> 02:18:08.303]  Look at this laser test.
[02:18:08.323 --> 02:18:12.704]  I mean, yeah, this is what happens when you won't give up what they want.
[02:18:13.765 --> 02:18:35.942]   And so when we're talking about the way to actually be resistant, when we're talking about Alex, just a few days ago, six million people viewed on Twitter I was standing in a Target parking lot showing two dozen spaces that have now been recreated where you can have contactless pickups and order deliveries in a town of 16,000 people where there's never more than a hundred cars in the parking lot.
[02:18:36.683 --> 02:18:37.724]  What is the reason for that?
[02:18:37.844 --> 02:18:39.705]  The reason for that is because they're doing it corporate-wide.
[02:18:40.126 --> 02:18:42.408]  Why anybody would still shop at Target, I have no idea.
[02:18:43.297 --> 02:18:46.980]  Why anybody could sit back and look at that and say, well, no, this is just something.
[02:18:47.661 --> 02:18:49.762]  They're just repaving the parking lot.
[02:18:50.403 --> 02:19:03.133]  They're catering to a group of people who realize after the unfortunate pandemic hit, and we lost so many millions of lives to COVID-19, that people realize that it's actually a whole lot more convenient and much more safe to be able to shop in that way.
[02:19:03.173 --> 02:19:03.994]  That's not what this is.
[02:19:04.693 --> 02:19:07.675]  And by the way, let me show this footage from like 15 years ago or whatever it was.
[02:19:08.735 --> 02:19:10.096]  Notice, we didn't know what was happening.
[02:19:10.536 --> 02:19:18.200]  We would shoot, we showed a bunch of Star Wars toys, and the white and blue toys wouldn't burn up, the dark toys would, because they absorb it.
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:19.341]  It's very simple science.
[02:19:19.801 --> 02:19:26.285]  Other people are now showing this where Baby Blue won't burn under a laser, most lasers, but the others will.
[02:19:26.305 --> 02:19:27.746]  Look at this, we're shooting other lasers, nothing.
[02:19:28.046 --> 02:19:30.307]  But we shoot black toys, they burn up.
[02:19:30.927 --> 02:19:32.388]  We shoot the white toys, they won't.
[02:19:32.888 --> 02:19:33.869]  I mean, it's right there.
[02:19:37.102 --> 02:19:38.122]  It was right there on Maui.
[02:19:39.183 --> 02:19:47.065]  We just talked about how t-shirts were in completely incinerated, blown away homes, but a blue t-shirt is suddenly non-flammable.
[02:19:47.765 --> 02:19:50.926]  We saw fire rolling across pavement.
[02:19:50.946 --> 02:19:52.746]  When was the last time you saw blacktop burning?
[02:19:53.446 --> 02:19:56.387]  We saw fire out in the middle of the ocean.
[02:19:57.542 --> 02:19:58.883]  People were standing in the ocean.
[02:19:58.963 --> 02:20:07.705]  I saw one story of a man who held a two-year-old baby because the baby's father was physically incapable of holding the baby anymore and said, would you please hold my baby?
[02:20:07.725 --> 02:20:12.126]  This guy held this baby for three hours while they turned around and they watched everything burn.
[02:20:12.547 --> 02:20:13.607]  Nobody's coming for them.
[02:20:13.907 --> 02:20:14.927]  Nobody's coming to help them.
[02:20:14.947 --> 02:20:16.708]  What exactly FEMA has been doing there?
[02:20:17.108 --> 02:20:17.968]  Absolutely nothing.
[02:20:18.448 --> 02:20:19.849]  What the Coast Guard did to help out?
[02:20:20.009 --> 02:20:20.849]  Absolutely nothing.
[02:20:21.509 --> 02:20:29.514]  The federal government isn't helping with anything because the federal government just perpetuated an actual physical-style, military-style attack on its own people.
[02:20:30.935 --> 02:20:33.557]  And so when you have people... But I didn't even... I thought of this last night.
[02:20:34.177 --> 02:20:34.897]  I told the crew.
[02:20:35.238 --> 02:20:36.378]  Wait, we did a video.
[02:20:36.418 --> 02:20:38.880]  We wondered why the white and blue toys wouldn't burn.
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:39.820]  Look at it.
[02:20:40.261 --> 02:20:42.822]  But the black toys and brown toys would.
[02:20:42.842 --> 02:20:44.363]  And that's it.
[02:20:47.986 --> 02:20:48.546]  It's insane.
[02:20:51.744 --> 02:21:03.211]  So what do you do with a population full of people where you still have three-quarters of the country who's unwilling to accept the premise that their government is capable of a military-style attack against them?
[02:21:03.351 --> 02:21:08.214]  When the same government actually put into Fort Detrick a weapon of biowarfare.
[02:21:09.155 --> 02:21:16.700]  When SARS-CoV-2 and its genetic sequence was actually made at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Ralph Barrett, these people are still walking around.
[02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:18.421]  Tony Fauci is still walking around.
[02:21:19.207 --> 02:21:21.970]  In retirement, enjoying himself after killing millions of people.
[02:21:23.252 --> 02:21:29.900]  But you have these masses of people who are still willing to go along with this and are actually looking forward to this right here.
[02:21:30.799 --> 02:21:33.541]  They're looking forward to this contactless shopping.
[02:21:33.561 --> 02:21:36.302]  They're looking forward to the two weeks to slow the spread.
[02:21:36.322 --> 02:21:37.843]  We could just sit inside and watch Netflix.
[02:21:37.923 --> 02:21:39.504]  I want to give you the floor right now.
[02:21:39.904 --> 02:21:45.347]  We're going to play your Target video, because when you were on with me, I was trying to get you on all the time, and we got you.
[02:21:45.367 --> 02:21:46.688]  You thought you were coming on about your Target video.
[02:21:46.728 --> 02:21:47.268]  I hadn't seen it.
[02:21:47.288 --> 02:21:53.592]  Right after you go off the show, they go, you didn't see his video with 5 million views, and now it's got like 20 million, where you went to your local Target.
[02:21:53.652 --> 02:22:01.156]   Now all over the country, I would send countless videos of Targets, Walmarts, setting up 10, 20, 30, Rollers, brand new construction at Target.
[02:22:00.995 --> 02:22:05.275]   that's just a new business. No, they're getting ready now at California admitting
[02:22:05.275 --> 02:22:08.754]   lockdowns are coming back. It's all confirmed, new shots, everything. We're
[02:22:08.754 --> 02:22:11.795]   gonna play this clip and I'm giving the floor about the next COVID rollout and
[02:22:11.795 --> 02:22:16.754]   how Stu Peters, tomorrow's news today, thinks how we beat it. But here it is.
[02:22:16.754 --> 02:22:22.225]  Rollers, brand new construction at Target. What is it for?
[02:22:22.225 --> 02:22:29.475]   Not one, not three, not five, not even seven, but two dozen, 24 brand new drive up
[02:22:29.475 --> 02:22:32.395]   terminals in a town of 16,000 people.
[02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:33.121]  What would be the need for that?
[02:22:33.581 --> 02:22:35.283]  I'll tell you the need for that because they're bringing it back.
[02:22:36.216 --> 02:22:37.817]  They're going to bring back draconian lockdowns.
[02:22:37.857 --> 02:22:45.939]  They're going to bring back the torturous mask mandates in schools, strapping your kids up with a medical device and oxygen inhibiting bacteria ridden Sharia face muzzle.
[02:22:46.279 --> 02:22:47.859]  They're going to bring back the injection mandates.
[02:22:47.879 --> 02:22:49.080]  They're going to close down churches.
[02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:52.361]  They're going to close down small businesses while these people stay open.
[02:22:52.421 --> 02:22:53.701]  And the pharmacies expanded too.
[02:22:53.741 --> 02:22:54.561]  Why do you think that is?
[02:22:55.241 --> 02:22:59.763]  And now California just updated this week their official page saying they're doing it.
[02:23:00.403 --> 02:23:02.123]  So we caught them with their pants down.
[02:23:02.143 --> 02:23:07.651]   Thank God day one You helped boost our story two weeks ago, so it went huge.
[02:23:08.452 --> 02:23:13.035]  We didn't know they'd roll it out like that very afternoon, but this is a big deal.
[02:23:13.095 --> 02:23:14.596]  I think we've got a good chance of stopping them.
[02:23:14.956 --> 02:23:15.977]  What do you think they're about to pull?
[02:23:17.785 --> 02:23:28.828]  Well, if you thought that COVID-1 was draconian or overreaching or unconstitutional or violent in nature or murderous in nature, what we're about to see is going to be the nail in the coffin.
[02:23:28.948 --> 02:23:30.928]  I mean, so you see how desperate that they are.
[02:23:31.448 --> 02:23:35.729]  You know, as much as we think that elections are fake and rigged and stolen, we know that they are.
[02:23:35.829 --> 02:23:36.569]  We know that they're rigged.
[02:23:36.589 --> 02:23:37.530]  We know that they're stolen.
[02:23:38.070 --> 02:23:42.551]  As much black pills as I can spit every day about our election process, here's what is real.
[02:23:43.795 --> 02:23:50.238]  What is real is if you look at the way that they're targeting Donald Trump, they're doing that because Donald Trump mainstreams a message.
[02:23:50.278 --> 02:23:55.280]  Donald Trump wakes up millions of people who now see, oh, well, the government is fake.
[02:23:55.800 --> 02:23:57.901]  We don't really have a two-party representative system.
[02:23:57.941 --> 02:24:10.087]  We have a uniparty of globalists who are controlled by foreign interests and Israeli Mossad operations and a central banking criminal cabal and BlackRock and Vanguard and, you know, maybe George Soros and the Rothschilds.
[02:24:10.326 --> 02:24:15.846]   You know, we see this ultimate control by the CCP or the infiltration of our government at every level.
[02:24:15.846 --> 02:24:18.646]   And that was something that Donald Trump helped to mainstream.
[02:24:18.646 --> 02:24:23.367]   Millions of people, that's very dangerous for, you know, that many people, hundreds of millions
[02:24:23.367 --> 02:24:28.486]   across our country to now be awake or at least open to receiving the idea that we live under this
[02:24:28.486 --> 02:24:32.566]   fake illusion, this movie of The Matrix, which was a documentary instead of a movie.
[02:24:32.566 --> 02:24:35.045]   And so when you have all these people, they have to target him.
[02:24:35.045 --> 02:24:37.447]   And by extension, what they're telling you is, hey, we're targeting you.
[02:24:37.447 --> 02:24:42.165]   So if you question the election or the veracity of it, or if you dispute the electors,
[02:24:42.165 --> 02:24:44.806]   or if you have an alternate slate of them, that becomes a criminal offense.
[02:24:44.806 --> 02:24:46.806]  You're part of a criminal conspiracy.
[02:24:46.806 --> 02:24:49.685]  If you tweet or, you know, tell people to go watch.
[02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:51.851]  Election integrity hearings on OAN.
[02:24:51.871 --> 02:24:53.811]  I mean, apparently that's a criminal conspiracy now as well.
[02:24:53.831 --> 02:24:57.612]  If you haven't read the indictment, you should read the indictment, particularly the one out of Georgia, because it's all BS.
[02:24:57.672 --> 02:25:07.434]  It's beyond, they say, Trump falsely claimed, section 7, that they closed down the counting center in Atlanta and blocked the windows and kept counting.
[02:25:07.534 --> 02:25:08.835]  It's not, they admit they did!
[02:25:10.735 --> 02:25:12.175]  It's all on video that they did it.
[02:25:12.796 --> 02:25:29.223]   And so, when you have The targeting of a man like that, by extension meaning that the number one enemy of these people is the masses of people who would not be okay with this sort of authoritarian, totalitarian, one world governance that's coming our way.
[02:25:29.483 --> 02:25:30.705]  Of course, nobody wants that.
[02:25:31.286 --> 02:25:35.328]  And so all of the constructs that they have put in the way, do you support Ukraine or do you not?
[02:25:35.348 --> 02:25:37.689]  Do you believe that Hunter Biden is a criminal or do you not?
[02:25:37.789 --> 02:25:39.170]  Are you a racist or are you not?
[02:25:39.250 --> 02:25:43.612]  Are you a right wing extremist or are you a liberal left wing freedom lover?
[02:25:43.692 --> 02:25:51.616]  You know, I mean, all of the constructs that they have put up in the place to run these psychological operations to divide and conquer are absolutely happening.
[02:25:51.656 --> 02:26:05.116]   And so now what you have is people that are so set in their ways, people that are so in love With the nanny state idea of government control to feel safe under a security blanket of protection that's provided by the government at the cost of the taxpayer.
[02:26:05.882 --> 02:26:16.288]  You have literally this group of people who really believes that what Donald Trump did, and by extension, everything that we do by questioning the official narrative should be deemed a criminal offense.
[02:26:16.728 --> 02:26:21.071]  And that means arresting people like Alex Jones, not just suing you or taking you off the air.
[02:26:21.371 --> 02:26:23.352]  No, that means coming after you and arresting you.
[02:26:23.372 --> 02:26:29.476]  That means arresting people like me who want to, weird concept here, uphold the rule of law.
[02:26:29.816 --> 02:26:35.059]  And so when you go to Las Vegas, by the way, met Owen Schroeder and Robin, a bunch of other people at your network, awesome people.
[02:26:35.459 --> 02:26:48.884]  When you go to an event like this in Vegas and you stand on a stage and you give a speech about extreme accountability, which are the measures that we really need to be mainstreaming and talking about right now, because we're not talking about trying Hunter Biden for some gun offense or tax evasion.
[02:26:48.904 --> 02:26:51.445]  We're talking about trying him for what he is, a treasonous traitor.
[02:26:52.025 --> 02:26:52.986]  And what does that mean?
[02:26:54.241 --> 02:26:56.161]  Why do we still allow these people to run around?
[02:26:56.241 --> 02:27:03.523]  Why haven't there been hundreds of millions of people that have gathered up and said, I don't care what political ideology you are, this doesn't sound right for the future of my children.
[02:27:03.603 --> 02:27:04.623]  And let's expand on that.
[02:27:05.103 --> 02:27:06.703]  We are winning globally.
[02:27:07.083 --> 02:27:08.464]  The Globalist Zone documents come out.
[02:27:08.764 --> 02:27:10.404]  Populism's winning, communism's winning.
[02:27:10.784 --> 02:27:11.764]  So imagine the globalists.
[02:27:12.164 --> 02:27:13.905]  Okay, they're in control of the executive branches.
[02:27:14.385 --> 02:27:16.185]  They can devalue your currency and inflation.
[02:27:16.325 --> 02:27:17.645]  Bloop!
[02:27:17.665 --> 02:27:21.106]  They can dissolve borders and send in giant third world hordes.
[02:27:21.206 --> 02:27:21.426]  Bloop!
[02:27:21.986 --> 02:27:24.167]  They can promote pedophilia to destroy the family, bloop!
[02:27:24.547 --> 02:27:26.968]  They can start war with Russia, bloop!
[02:27:27.428 --> 02:27:29.869]  They can use drone weapons with lasers, bloop!
[02:27:30.209 --> 02:27:32.790]  They can not turn the power off during a hurricane, bloop!
[02:27:33.370 --> 02:27:40.373]  Any button they've got to distract us and divert us, they're doing it because the end of their giant bubble's coming.
[02:27:41.214 --> 02:27:53.980]   And they want to bring in their new system of ESGs and social credit scores, so that's why they're throwing everything they've got In asymmetrical, fifth-generational warfare, and there's no doubt.
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:28:04.608]  And I'm not apologizing, because I'm admitting when I'm wrong, I looked at it, they didn't cut the trees, they left the power on, they cut the water off, very clear way to start the fire, but it wasn't enough.
[02:28:05.563 --> 02:28:06.584]  And they had arsonists everywhere.
[02:28:06.624 --> 02:28:08.205]  I talked to locals still setting fires.
[02:28:08.245 --> 02:28:13.649]  They caught 79 of them in Greece, and they catch them in California in 2000, and the media wouldn't cover it.
[02:28:13.689 --> 02:28:19.333]  We know arsonists are their front line, not trimming the brushes their front line, but that's only setting the stage.
[02:28:20.114 --> 02:28:29.481]  Then they come in, because I saw the footage, and I've seen it from a bunch of reporters, cars in the middle of green fields, hundreds of yards from flame.
[02:28:31.647 --> 02:28:32.447]  Microwave lasers.
[02:28:32.968 --> 02:28:33.468]  Microwaves.
[02:28:33.508 --> 02:28:33.868]  You're right.
[02:28:34.488 --> 02:28:34.968]  I looked at it.
[02:28:35.308 --> 02:28:36.329]  It's microwaves.
[02:28:36.509 --> 02:28:36.829]  Period.
[02:28:37.109 --> 02:28:37.509]  They did it.
[02:28:38.490 --> 02:28:39.710]  And now we got to ask, who did it?
[02:28:40.210 --> 02:28:41.811]  It shows how desperate they are.
[02:28:42.191 --> 02:28:49.454]  And God knows, because again, once they convert things over to nothing but drones, then no one even knows where it's coming from.
[02:28:50.315 --> 02:28:51.735]  Sorry, I'm ranting, but man.
[02:28:53.256 --> 02:28:55.257]  No, everything you said is absolutely right.
[02:28:55.797 --> 02:29:06.094]   And so When you have them unleashing actual lasers on Americans and destroying their homes and murdering children, I mean, that's what happened here.
[02:29:06.134 --> 02:29:07.835]  They murdered children stuck in their homes.
[02:29:07.855 --> 02:29:20.801]  When they're willing to do that, and all of the other aforementioned things that you were talking about that they can unleash, but they also cater to those that are waking up by giving them some sort of a reprieve and something to believe in.
[02:29:21.581 --> 02:29:24.202]  Toby Keith, we'll put a boot in your ass, it's the American way.
[02:29:25.862 --> 02:29:27.203]  Let's go support the war.
[02:29:27.623 --> 02:29:33.026]  You know, yeah, let's blow up that... Try that in a small town.
[02:29:33.446 --> 02:29:34.787]  Yeah, we'll get Black Rock.
[02:29:34.807 --> 02:29:35.847]  They left the power on.
[02:29:36.128 --> 02:29:40.070]  The Washington Post admitted, yeah, they didn't turn the power off.
[02:29:40.090 --> 02:29:40.670]  That's why I did it.
[02:29:40.690 --> 02:29:42.351]  That's when I started questioning, well, maybe I'm wrong.
[02:29:43.692 --> 02:29:44.492]  Oliver Anthony.
[02:29:45.473 --> 02:29:47.834]  The rich man north of Richmond, right?
[02:29:48.194 --> 02:29:49.515]  He turns out to be a total leftist.
[02:29:50.529 --> 02:29:55.034]  Total leftist, total fraud, fake accent, major psy-op, part of a deep state operation.
[02:29:55.054 --> 02:29:56.756]  He's always in an old truck leaning back.
[02:29:57.337 --> 02:30:01.161]  I knew he was fake four days ago when I saw him in a truck doing a fake accent.
[02:30:01.642 --> 02:30:03.484]  Yeah, I don't like you conservatives.
[02:30:03.584 --> 02:30:05.266]  I'm a good old boy.
[02:30:06.207 --> 02:30:24.761]   You know what has to happen is what has to happen is that When even a small percentage, just single millions of people, realize what happened to them through COVID and at Maui and at 9-11 in Afghanistan and what's happening in Ukraine and what's happening in your children's schools, is that they tell these people and they mean it when they say,
[02:30:25.442 --> 02:30:41.228]  When hundreds of millions or even billions of those injected with the American DoD-made bioweapon across this planet realize what has happened to them, that there absolutely will be no safe place for the people who did this to hide, and they have to mean it when they say it.
[02:30:42.226 --> 02:30:42.866]  I know you gotta go.
[02:30:43.707 --> 02:30:44.747]  But do five more minutes with us.
[02:30:44.767 --> 02:30:45.747]  Stu Peters is on fire.
[02:30:45.767 --> 02:30:51.129]  You gotta come back this week, next week for a full hour, because I love you to death and I just, you're dead on here.
[02:30:51.210 --> 02:30:52.470]  Alright, Stu Peters is our guest.
[02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:54.051]  RealStuPeters on Twitter.
[02:30:54.351 --> 02:30:55.231]  StuPeters.com.
[02:30:55.631 --> 02:30:57.092]  We're gonna come back and talk more with this guy.
[02:30:57.132 --> 02:30:57.872]  He's dead on.
[02:30:58.352 --> 02:31:00.553]  Folks, only microwaves can do that.
[02:31:00.833 --> 02:31:01.473]  They hit Maui.
[02:31:02.114 --> 02:31:05.695]  You know, there's a popular meme, Alex Jones is always right.
[02:31:06.295 --> 02:31:07.216]  Or Alex Jones is right.
[02:31:07.256 --> 02:31:07.936]  And that's not true.
[02:31:09.144 --> 02:31:12.247]  I'm right about 95% of the time, a little too cautious sometimes.
[02:31:13.008 --> 02:31:17.512]  But now that I'm a big direction energy guy, I've studied it forever, covered it for 29 years on air.
[02:31:18.053 --> 02:31:22.016]  But I knew the power lines fell, I knew they cut the water off, and I saw the burning power lines.
[02:31:22.637 --> 02:31:23.518]  So I knew that was part of it.
[02:31:23.538 --> 02:31:31.345]  But I've seen the footage, 100 yards from any flame, green grass trees, cars vaporized, and then a blue car sitting there fine.
[02:31:31.626 --> 02:31:32.427]  And then I was like, wait a minute.
[02:31:33.067 --> 02:31:37.070]  I told the crew today, I said, search engine blue bounces lasers.
[02:31:37.170 --> 02:31:38.311]  Insurance hell, we found it!
[02:31:39.051 --> 02:31:42.394]  So, Stu, in the five minutes we got left, I'm on your show, 6 p.m.
[02:31:42.474 --> 02:31:42.974]  tomorrow.
[02:31:43.314 --> 02:31:45.176]  People can find you at StuPeters.com.
[02:31:45.536 --> 02:31:47.497]  Real Stu Peters on Twitter, megaviral every day.
[02:31:47.998 --> 02:31:48.498]  I'll be on with you.
[02:31:48.518 --> 02:31:50.179]  I want to invite you back to talk about space.
[02:31:50.900 --> 02:31:55.303]  So, I saw you put out a few days ago the Chinese video of them landing on Mars.
[02:31:55.803 --> 02:31:59.586]  It looks like bad graphics from the 1990s and a cheap video game.
[02:32:01.727 --> 02:32:03.472]  So yeah, we're going to cover it all.
[02:32:03.833 --> 02:32:06.561]  The government's gone full fake in the four minutes we have left.
[02:32:06.942 --> 02:32:07.965]  Other key points you want to add?
[02:32:09.508 --> 02:32:10.108]  Yeah, look at this.
[02:32:10.168 --> 02:32:10.929]  I mean, here's the landing.
[02:32:10.949 --> 02:32:14.190]  It almost looks as bad as our moon landing, which, of course, we've lost the technology for.
[02:32:14.210 --> 02:32:17.032]  Look, we've lived under the empire of lies for decades.
[02:32:18.093 --> 02:32:33.821]  The purpose of this is to keep you, you know, inside of your virtual or digital pod before they put you into your physical pod, to keep you in your virtual or digital prison camp, or your digital, you know, or virtual gulag before they throw you into the physical hard labor prisons that they have.
[02:32:33.841 --> 02:32:34.941]  Yeah, look at this Indian pledge.
[02:32:35.021 --> 02:32:36.302]  I mean, this is like a 1960s bad B-movie.
[02:32:39.486 --> 02:32:46.070]  I've seen better graphics on, you know, games of Pac-Man at the, you know, old greasy spoon bar and grill when I was nine years old.
[02:32:46.191 --> 02:32:52.715]  I mean, this is... It's horrendous to think that these people believe that we are this stupid that we'll defend this, but yet...
[02:32:53.368 --> 02:32:56.590]  There really is a portion of our population that is that stupid.
[02:32:57.210 --> 02:33:06.396]  If you go right now and you search Stu Peters and click on the news results, you'll see Rolling Stone and USA Today with big articles about how I knocked this Indian moon landing.
[02:33:06.416 --> 02:33:07.357]  Well, of course I did.
[02:33:07.717 --> 02:33:10.339]  And then they try to legitimize it by calling me names.
[02:33:11.159 --> 02:33:20.186]  Here's the deal, we mentioned the direct energy weapons and whether it was lasers or microwaves, frequencies, we know that frequencies are extremely important.
[02:33:20.286 --> 02:33:24.409]  What's a recent phenomenon in our country and probably across the planet right now?
[02:33:24.909 --> 02:33:25.850]  Magnetized meat.
[02:33:26.190 --> 02:33:31.053]  You know, viral videos of people going into the supermarkets and sticking magnetic objects to meat.
[02:33:31.534 --> 02:33:35.036]  Excuse me, your beef and your pork and your chicken is not supposed to be magnetic.
[02:33:35.136 --> 02:33:37.118]  There's no metal inside of those things until now.
[02:33:37.959 --> 02:33:46.526]  People are not supposed to be able to stick magnetic things to their head and their foreheads and this isn't just in vaccinated people who have been inoculated with this weapon of biowarfare but shedding is real.
[02:33:46.566 --> 02:33:48.468]  Pfizer admitted it in their own documents.
[02:33:48.968 --> 02:33:53.833]  People who have worked their asses off to completely avoid being injected with this and to keep their children safe.
[02:33:54.193 --> 02:34:02.757]  People who lost their jobs, didn't get the promotion that they wanted, people who were kicked out of the military and sacrificed everything to avoid this, are now at risk and they are magnetized as well.
[02:34:02.857 --> 02:34:03.137]  Why?
[02:34:03.197 --> 02:34:17.303]  Well, we find among other things, a whole lot of other things, graphene oxide, lipid nanoparticles, and dangerous heavy metals, combined with all the other poisons in these shots, are existing in people's bloodstreams now.
[02:34:18.300 --> 02:34:28.409]  And so if all of us are magnetic or magnetized in some way, if you're going to the graveyard and you can on your Bluetooth pick up frequencies of people who've been recently buried, that's not normal.
[02:34:28.469 --> 02:34:30.211]  Don't try to gaslight me, that's not normal.
[02:34:30.651 --> 02:34:43.960]   If people really have these heavy metals inside of them that can communicate with my iPhone or with your Samsung, Then, of course, they can communicate with microwaves and frequencies and or lasers, direct energy weapons.
[02:34:44.421 --> 02:34:46.722]  What about 5G and the implementation of 5G?
[02:34:46.782 --> 02:34:50.384]  Why did it all roll out in silent in the quiet without anybody knowing about it during the COVID lockdown?
[02:34:50.404 --> 02:34:59.909]  Well, we've had engineers come out years ago that they found in 5G towers in England confirmed transistor-pointed directed energy particle beams in them to zap certain cars they wanted.
[02:35:00.189 --> 02:35:03.511]  So you drive by, you get hit, don't feel good, die of cancer six months later.
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:09.122]  Yeah, and so all of a sudden you're going to have people walking down the street and just, boom, unplugged from the Matrix, 5G.
[02:35:09.162 --> 02:35:10.863]  We got Alex Jones' number right here.
[02:35:11.163 --> 02:35:11.884]  Let's pull him up.
[02:35:12.144 --> 02:35:12.404]  Boom.
[02:35:12.444 --> 02:35:12.684]  Done.
[02:35:12.744 --> 02:35:13.565]  You're gone.
[02:35:14.225 --> 02:35:16.026]  This is the future if we don't resist.
[02:35:16.086 --> 02:35:18.647]  I'm talking full resistance and full accountability.
[02:35:18.667 --> 02:35:21.429]  I'm not talking about some half-hearted January 6th.
[02:35:21.449 --> 02:35:27.592]  And when I'm back on the show and we're talking about space, when you come on my show, by the way, Alex Jones live on the Stu Peters Show tomorrow, 6 p.m.
[02:35:27.652 --> 02:35:28.352]  Eastern, don't miss it.
[02:35:28.372 --> 02:35:29.213]  StuPeters.com.
[02:35:29.493 --> 02:35:33.195]  We're going to talk about what real extreme accountability looks like and how to affect it.
[02:35:33.235 --> 02:35:33.595]  I can't wait.
[02:35:33.775 --> 02:35:34.275]  Can't wait.
[02:35:34.355 --> 02:35:36.277]  Well, brother, you're right about the direct energy weapons.
[02:35:36.377 --> 02:35:37.797]  They did the power line thing, too.
[02:35:38.198 --> 02:35:39.618]  We're both right, but great job.
[02:35:40.219 --> 02:35:43.981]  And, I mean, burned out buildings, blue shirts just laying there, and it's everywhere.
[02:35:44.061 --> 02:35:45.162]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:35:45.622 --> 02:35:46.282]  We'll be right back.
[02:35:46.141 --> 02:36:07.902]  Thank you, Stu Peters.
[02:36:07.909 --> 02:36:12.312]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[02:36:12.752 --> 02:36:15.213]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[02:36:15.774 --> 02:36:25.160]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.

[02:37:18.911 --> 02:37:19.672]  Ask you a quick question.
[02:37:20.012 --> 02:37:22.095]  So you are obviously a person of color like we are.
[02:37:22.255 --> 02:37:22.435]  Yeah.
[02:37:22.696 --> 02:37:24.518]  And we're supposed to not be Trump supporters.
[02:37:24.558 --> 02:37:25.579]  So what is it about Trump?
[02:37:25.599 --> 02:37:25.979]  You know what?
[02:37:25.999 --> 02:37:27.121]  I'm going to tell you something right now.
[02:37:27.141 --> 02:37:29.383]  I was talking to my husband about it earlier.
[02:37:29.423 --> 02:37:38.892]   And when I really started educating myself and informing myself on Donald Trump, One thing that I'm passionate about is human trafficking, that especially of children.
[02:37:38.913 --> 02:37:43.716]  And when I really started digging into it, I saw that Trump also is a huge supporter.
[02:37:44.056 --> 02:37:49.741]  He donated recently $35 million to support human traffic survivors.
[02:37:49.921 --> 02:37:52.082]  That really struck a chord with my heart.
[02:37:52.102 --> 02:37:55.985]  And so when I started really looking into him, I started, I'm about action.
[02:37:56.145 --> 02:37:57.046]  I'm not about words.
[02:37:57.426 --> 02:37:57.887]  Okay.
[02:37:57.947 --> 02:37:59.988]  I like the fact that he says what's on his mind.
[02:38:00.288 --> 02:38:03.491]  I like the fact that he doesn't say what he thinks people want to hear from him.
[02:38:04.251 --> 02:38:08.934]  And to me, I know everything that he's done for the black communities, and I stand behind him 100%.
[02:38:08.974 --> 02:38:13.256]  I'm not only a Trump supporter, I am a Trump lover.
[02:38:13.716 --> 02:38:16.477]  And for the longest time, I've been afraid to come out and say that.
[02:38:17.038 --> 02:38:17.718]  Well, here we go.
[02:38:17.738 --> 02:38:21.820]  Because I didn't want to lose my blackness or my black friends or whatever.
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:24.781]  Remember what Joe Biden said, if you vote for Trump, you ain't black.
[02:38:24.902 --> 02:38:31.552]   So if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump and you ain't black, That's what he said.
[02:38:31.572 --> 02:38:32.233]  That's what he said.
[02:38:32.373 --> 02:38:36.818]  On March 20th, 2003, the United States invaded Iraq.
[02:38:37.359 --> 02:38:42.025]  Exactly one year before the invasion, Alex Jones predicted it.
[02:38:42.606 --> 02:38:45.349]  So now everybody's going, wow, it really was the Iraqis.
[02:38:45.369 --> 02:38:47.152]  That's just because they're getting ready to invade Iraq.
[02:38:48.237 --> 02:38:49.258]  What a beautiful setup!
[02:38:49.639 --> 02:38:55.746]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[02:39:31.045 --> 02:39:39.194]   When castles towered over vast landscapes and knights championed honor and valor, there came an unforeseen
[02:39:39.194 --> 02:39:40.045]  darkness.
[02:39:40.337 --> 02:39:47.382]  Amidst this impending doom stood a knight called Alex Jones, a brave and outspoken herald known as the Truth Sayer.
[02:39:47.563 --> 02:39:49.444]  Sir Alex Jones was not alone.
[02:39:49.684 --> 02:39:55.289]  In his most desperate hour in the battle against evil, a radiant light descended from the heavens.
[02:39:55.689 --> 02:40:00.133]  God, in all his glory and his legion of angels, stood by Alex's side.
[02:40:00.413 --> 02:40:05.234]  The battle raged on, but with every blow, Alex Jones' conviction grew stronger.
[02:40:05.514 --> 02:40:09.155]  With every truth he proclaimed, the demonic forces faltered.
[02:40:09.735 --> 02:40:17.176]  When the enemy was vanquished, Alex Jones swore a solemn oath that should the realm need him again, he would return.
[02:40:17.476 --> 02:40:23.697]  And now it's Alex Jones, leading a full frontal assault on the satanic New World Order.

[02:40:32.085 --> 02:40:40.308]  In a galaxy torn by conflict, where darkness spreads its tendrils across the universe, one hero rises against the immeasurable might of the globalists.

[02:40:45.611 --> 02:40:49.632]  Prepare for the ultimate battle for truth with today's War Room broadcast.
[02:40:50.453 --> 02:40:53.954]  Now, it's your host, Owen Schroyer and his intrepid crew.
[02:40:54.434 --> 02:40:58.516]  Find the show and share the links at infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:05.271]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[02:41:05.331 --> 02:41:13.616]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[02:41:14.037 --> 02:41:16.538]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[02:41:16.558 --> 02:41:18.039]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:20.241]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[02:41:20.501 --> 02:41:22.624]  The Communist Chinese take control of the main universities.
[02:41:22.864 --> 02:41:23.906]  This is all confirmed.
[02:41:23.946 --> 02:41:24.947]  This is not a drill.
[02:41:25.047 --> 02:41:28.993]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[02:41:29.333 --> 02:41:30.735]  They've officially become state-run.
[02:41:30.876 --> 02:41:31.336]  Apple 100%.
[02:41:31.617 --> 02:41:37.365]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[02:41:37.825 --> 02:41:42.567]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[02:41:42.887 --> 02:41:43.748]  This is happening.
[02:41:43.768 --> 02:41:51.691]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[02:41:51.791 --> 02:41:57.694]  Now, this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[02:41:58.154 --> 02:42:06.118]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion paradigm manipulation.
[02:42:06.958 --> 02:42:10.700]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[02:42:10.820 --> 02:42:14.161]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[02:42:14.241 --> 02:42:21.365]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[02:42:21.565 --> 02:42:24.246]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[02:42:24.566 --> 02:42:28.948]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control.
[02:42:33.065 --> 02:42:37.505]   attacking the United States with traitors inside the major security agencies, blocking
[02:42:37.505 --> 02:42:41.984]   Trump's resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of
[02:42:41.984 --> 02:42:45.664]  the Chi-Com/Big Tech hanging combine emergency situation.
[02:42:45.664 --> 02:42:49.264]   I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been
[02:42:49.264 --> 02:42:52.145]  battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[02:42:52.145 --> 02:42:57.345]   They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[02:42:57.345 --> 02:43:00.865]  where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[02:43:00.842 --> 02:43:05.728]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[02:43:06.128 --> 02:43:11.014]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[02:43:11.374 --> 02:43:19.037]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[02:43:19.237 --> 02:43:26.259]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they can now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[02:43:26.399 --> 02:43:32.061]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[02:43:32.321 --> 02:43:37.022]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[02:43:37.021 --> 02:43:40.460]  I have given you the transmission! Now break free!
[02:43:40.460 --> 02:43:53.101]   I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:43:53.204 --> 02:43:54.585]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:43:54.465 --> 02:44:01.465]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:44:01.465 --> 02:44:14.465]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, "I don't know what's
[02:44:14.465 --> 02:44:16.905]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?"
[02:44:17.139 --> 02:44:19.322]  You better believe you got one!
[02:44:21.243 --> 02:44:27.243]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:44:45.243 --> 02:44:52.053]   Well, she called me about a month ago, and she called me about three weeks ago, and I was so busy I didn't call her
[02:44:52.053 --> 02:44:52.243]  back.
[02:44:52.464 --> 02:44:55.284]  Dr. Stella Manuel, medical doctor, fellow Texan, great patriot.
[02:44:56.004 --> 02:44:58.345]  She said, Alex, they're bringing the COVID restrictions back.
[02:44:59.785 --> 02:45:07.448]   And then, over two weeks ago, when I got a call from a big whistleblower at TSA, He told me it was coming back and he gave me the evidence.
[02:45:07.628 --> 02:45:08.410]  Now it's been announced.
[02:45:09.352 --> 02:45:12.438]  And so she's here to talk about it, but there's a lie out there.
[02:45:14.178 --> 02:45:20.826]  And I love Senator Paul, I don't think he's lying, but he says, oh, there's no threat from COVID, there's nothing happening, they're just selling us to sell the new vaccine.
[02:45:20.866 --> 02:45:34.441]  Well, yeah, the vaccine's not the answer, but there is record sickness, there is hospitals being overwhelmed, and there's a lot of reasons it's happening, because these vaccines have destroyed immune systems, and most of the folks in hospitals have taken the shots.
[02:45:35.242 --> 02:45:37.423]  But people need to get prepared, they need to get ready.
[02:45:37.863 --> 02:45:47.468]  Dr. Stella Emanuel is an MD, a successful physician with an active practice in Houston, as well as the founder of Firepower Ministries in Katy, Texas.
[02:45:48.009 --> 02:45:59.454]   She devotes her life and resources to teaching believers everywhere to identify the sources of spiritual weakness, deception, and defeat, to learn strategies of warfare to enable them to get And maintain their freedom.
[02:45:59.734 --> 02:46:01.035]  DrStellaMD.com.
[02:46:01.835 --> 02:46:08.316]  So I asked her to come back from South Texas to Central Texas today to cover the developments.
[02:46:08.376 --> 02:46:10.176]  California admits on their own site.
[02:46:10.196 --> 02:46:11.157]  We covered the first hour.
[02:46:12.657 --> 02:46:15.057]  They're bringing back all the COVID protocols.
[02:46:15.898 --> 02:46:16.118]  Yes.
[02:46:16.618 --> 02:46:22.839]  And universities, public schools everywhere, colleges are saying you got to take the shot.
[02:46:24.042 --> 02:46:31.271]  They announced days ago, what I told you from my source, that on the 15th of September, they're bringing out the new shot.
[02:46:31.631 --> 02:46:34.414]  And that's what the Border Patrol and TSA told me.
[02:46:34.975 --> 02:46:36.457]  They nailed the date because they were there.
[02:46:36.477 --> 02:46:38.139]  People say, how'd you nail it?
[02:46:38.459 --> 02:46:39.901]  They tell the feds a few days before.
[02:46:40.501 --> 02:46:41.142]  They tell us.
[02:46:42.063 --> 02:46:44.704]  And so, I think we caught them with their pants down.
[02:46:44.744 --> 02:46:46.645]  I'm not declaring victory yet, far from it.
[02:46:46.985 --> 02:46:54.449]  But it's an example of how if we're aware of things, as they roll them out and say no up front, it gives us tremendous power.
[02:46:55.149 --> 02:46:57.751]  So Dr. Stella Emanuel, our listeners love you, I love you.
[02:46:58.071 --> 02:47:06.975]  Your big press conferences with Trump and the Congress and everything, you got targeted, but you've been vindicated and proven right.
[02:47:07.035 --> 02:47:21.948]   So going through this now, With what you're seeing as a doctor in Houston, and treating patients all over the world through your telemedicine, and with now, you were here a week ago, seems like a hundred years ago, so much they've confirmed they're doing it, but at the same time trying to deny it.
[02:47:22.208 --> 02:47:22.769]  What's happening?
[02:47:24.290 --> 02:47:28.174]  I sent out a tweet in July 30th and said that COVID is back.
[02:47:28.214 --> 02:47:33.599]  I don't know why, because it's not supposed to be, you know, RNA viruses actually are supposed to be something.
[02:47:33.719 --> 02:47:34.239]  Give us your Twitter.
[02:47:34.259 --> 02:47:34.940]  We're going to put that up.
[02:47:35.220 --> 02:47:39.341]  Yeah, RNA viruses are not supposed to be something, or viruses, they're not supposed to happen in the summer.
[02:47:39.662 --> 02:47:42.543]  It's usually flu, you know, RSV and other stuff.
[02:47:42.903 --> 02:47:45.344]  COVID is supposed to... Give us your Twitter, we're going to pull up again.
[02:47:45.384 --> 02:47:47.944]  I'm interrupting, but... Stella underscore Emmanuel.
[02:47:48.345 --> 02:47:48.565]  Yeah.
[02:47:48.965 --> 02:47:50.926]  So I sent out a tweet and said COVID is back.
[02:47:50.946 --> 02:47:51.586]  We don't know why.
[02:47:51.646 --> 02:47:52.506]  People be prepared.
[02:47:52.526 --> 02:47:53.166]  Good handling.
[02:47:53.186 --> 02:47:55.147]  And you were the first to call me before even the whistleblower.
[02:47:55.287 --> 02:47:58.730]  Yeah, so when I sent it out, everybody's like, oh, don't be fear mongering.
[02:47:58.810 --> 02:47:59.570]  It's not going to work.
[02:47:59.630 --> 02:48:00.251]  It's not happening.
[02:48:00.591 --> 02:48:02.232]  I said, for real, COVID is back.
[02:48:02.252 --> 02:48:04.354]  We're seeing more patients that are sick.
[02:48:04.734 --> 02:48:09.098]  It's not as bad as it was in the days of Delta, but we're seeing more patients that are sick.
[02:48:09.478 --> 02:48:12.781]  And Alex was seeing a lot of patients that are vaccinated that are sick.
[02:48:13.121 --> 02:48:16.504]  And our vaccinated patients, they are getting COVID two, three, four times, you know, over and over.
[02:48:16.524 --> 02:48:25.509]   Well, one of the numbers shows, I've had top scientists on, like McCullough and others, Mercola, McCullough, They're saying the numbers show almost everybody that's really sick is vaccinated.
[02:48:26.009 --> 02:48:27.810]  Yes, I don't see patients in the hospital.
[02:48:28.991 --> 02:48:33.552]  Right now, by God's grace, people are sensitive enough to come to us when they get sick immediately.
[02:48:33.952 --> 02:48:37.654]  So, we're seeing our patients and treating them, so we're not really dealing with hospitals.
[02:48:37.774 --> 02:48:39.615]  And there's what you said, there's what you said right there.
[02:48:40.774 --> 02:48:44.576]  I know doctors out there that are actually seeing patients in the hospital and they're seeing increase.
[02:48:44.997 --> 02:48:48.178]  I've had people run to me to come get their family members out of the hospital.
[02:48:48.198 --> 02:48:50.180]  A lady came to me to get the mother out of the hospital.
[02:48:50.200 --> 02:48:50.620]  I couldn't.
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:52.721]  That is why I tell people to be prepared up front.
[02:48:52.741 --> 02:48:55.423]  Don't wait till you're in the hospital because I can't come get you out of the hospital.
[02:48:55.863 --> 02:49:01.166]  And she went to the hospital for a procedure, got COVID, ended up getting intubated, given Randez-Savoy and killed.
[02:49:01.526 --> 02:49:07.090]  And Alex, the sad part is that they have not stopped the protocols in the hospitals.
[02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:22.206]  After three years, after many studies have come out to say hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin works, the protocol in the hospital is to bring the patient in, give them randesivir, maybe midazolam to kind of calm them down, intubate them, and they die.
[02:49:22.226 --> 02:49:23.288]  And let's talk about real world.
[02:49:23.628 --> 02:49:25.891]  I got tested four days ago.
[02:49:27.335 --> 02:49:28.876]  About two different testing facilities.
[02:49:28.896 --> 02:49:29.857]  They said, you don't have COVID.
[02:49:30.257 --> 02:49:30.877]  But I'm tough.
[02:49:31.258 --> 02:49:32.419]  I only get sick every five years.
[02:49:33.039 --> 02:49:33.860]  I had COVID two years ago.
[02:49:33.920 --> 02:49:34.660]  I know what it feels like.
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:35.821]  You were here last week.
[02:49:35.841 --> 02:49:37.142]  You said, hey, I think you're getting sick.
[02:49:37.162 --> 02:49:39.243]  You need to go on this stuff now.
[02:49:39.804 --> 02:49:40.304]  And I didn't.
[02:49:40.764 --> 02:49:45.387]  But then the medicine you gave Daria, I went ahead and started taking two days ago, and I'm 90% better.
[02:49:45.888 --> 02:49:49.430]  The steroid inhalables, the ivermectin, all of it.
[02:49:50.011 --> 02:49:54.294]  But that's what we're hearing is it's not testing as COVID, but it's COVID symptoms.
[02:49:54.334 --> 02:49:54.834]  What's happening?
[02:49:55.036 --> 02:50:00.396]   We've never really treated patients by testing because you know the tests you know the PCR
[02:50:00.396 --> 02:50:01.396]  test doesn't mean anything.
[02:50:01.396 --> 02:50:03.955]  They've tested papayas and they were positive.
[02:50:03.955 --> 02:50:05.516]  So the PCR test doesn't mean anything.
[02:50:05.516 --> 02:50:06.516]  So we don't really.
[02:50:06.516 --> 02:50:09.116]  The Tanzanian president tested it like goats and papayas.
[02:50:09.116 --> 02:50:10.116]  Yes, yeah.
[02:50:10.116 --> 02:50:12.555]  So we don't use testing to treat patients.
[02:50:12.824 --> 02:50:18.046]  I tell people right now that at this time, with what's going on right now, we don't know what is being released.
[02:50:18.366 --> 02:50:20.047]  They can call it another crazy variant.
[02:50:20.367 --> 02:50:24.588]  But all I know is that when you start having these symptoms, cold symptoms, don't play with it.
[02:50:24.669 --> 02:50:25.649]  Don't ignore it.
[02:50:26.229 --> 02:50:28.870]  Hydroxychloroquine and Affomectin, they are very safe medications.
[02:50:28.970 --> 02:50:30.151]  Take it up front.
[02:50:30.231 --> 02:50:31.311]  Make sure that you're treated.
[02:50:31.331 --> 02:50:32.932]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:50:32.952 --> 02:50:37.454]  They told people from Australia and the US, don't give treatment.
[02:50:37.514 --> 02:50:38.154]  Send them home.
[02:50:38.334 --> 02:50:39.875]  But if you get treatment early, you're fine.
[02:50:41.175 --> 02:50:56.098]  COVID is treated early because the initial part of COVID is a viral illness with steroids and good support and maybe good immune support and IV fluids and you know and non-specific antivirals like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin will help.
[02:50:56.418 --> 02:51:06.860]  But the second part of the COVID disease is actually a more systemic disease that you know that is that's where it starts shutting down your systems and you end up with pneumonia.
[02:51:06.920 --> 02:51:09.100]  And this is just like HIV that Fauci we now rolled out.
[02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:09.360]  Yes.
[02:51:09.620 --> 02:51:12.422]  They blocked the real treatments, gave them AZT to kill them.
[02:51:12.482 --> 02:51:13.423]  So it's the same story.
[02:51:13.462 --> 02:51:14.462]  So if you wait...
[02:51:14.462 --> 02:51:17.342]  Because the elite always gives themselves a way out.
[02:51:17.342 --> 02:51:22.702]   So if you wait until the second phase of COVID, even if you survive it, that is when people
[02:51:22.702 --> 02:51:27.743]   start having COVID lung symptoms, they have brain fog, because they've allowed the virus
[02:51:27.743 --> 02:51:31.222]  and the inflammation to affect a lot of their system.
[02:51:31.222 --> 02:51:34.542]   They've allowed the spike protein to really eat through their system.
[02:51:34.542 --> 02:51:38.702]   So that's why I tell people, even young people will not die from COVID, but it's better for
[02:51:38.702 --> 02:51:39.702]  them to treat it.
[02:51:39.702 --> 02:51:41.903]  So here's a real world take on it.
[02:51:41.922 --> 02:51:49.166]  Everything you taught me and others three years ago, my dad, 72 years old, smartest guy I ever knew, got COVID, almost killed him.
[02:51:49.527 --> 02:51:52.569]  And then he was getting senile, acting weird three, four months ago.
[02:51:53.249 --> 02:51:54.390]  And people said, it's long COVID.
[02:51:54.450 --> 02:51:57.952]  I got him in to see my big top medical doctor of clinics all over Texas.
[02:51:57.992 --> 02:51:59.033]  He follows everything you're saying.
[02:51:59.493 --> 02:52:03.376]  They put my dad on the very same stuff you're talking about.
[02:52:04.597 --> 02:52:05.838]  And he's back to normal.
[02:52:05.898 --> 02:52:06.438]  He got better.
[02:52:07.399 --> 02:52:09.340]  So this thing stays in you.
[02:52:09.580 --> 02:52:21.750]  Yes, and I tell people that I've had COVID and we have something that we developed that for COVID long because we know that the inflammation in the system is like a, it's a hypermetabolic state.
[02:52:22.130 --> 02:52:32.519]  So that's why we tell people COVID is better treated early and don't wait till you get to the hypermetabolic state that messes up a lot of your organs and then maybe... Don't wait till it colonizes you.
[02:52:32.819 --> 02:52:34.080]  Yes, don't wait to that state.
[02:52:34.120 --> 02:52:36.102]  But for those that have been colonized, what do you do?
[02:52:36.142 --> 02:52:38.665]  We have different, if you go on our website, we have different things.
[02:52:38.685 --> 02:52:40.487]  So if you have long COVID, what do you do?
[02:52:40.567 --> 02:52:42.569]  Yes, we have detox, we have the COVID.
[02:52:42.629 --> 02:52:43.950]  Long COVID means it's colonized.
[02:52:44.210 --> 02:52:51.398]  Yes, we have detox, we have something we did called COVID Light that we help people, long COVID and everything.
[02:52:51.838 --> 02:52:55.481]  Some people get relief, especially with brain fog and fatigue and everything.
[02:52:55.521 --> 02:52:57.463]  So yeah, you've taken our COVID light, right?
[02:52:57.503 --> 02:52:58.764]  I hope everybody loves it.
[02:52:59.104 --> 02:53:01.886]  We put together that supplement for COVID lung symptoms.
[02:53:02.186 --> 02:53:09.952]  It has promaganda, ginseng, cocutan, it has guarana, it has resveratrol that help with DNA repair.
[02:53:09.972 --> 02:53:12.254]  And we're going to talk about all that next segment.
[02:53:12.414 --> 02:53:15.657]  So it helps to repair you after you've gone through the system.
[02:53:15.757 --> 02:53:17.758]  And we're going to spend the next 30 minutes only on...
[02:53:20.840 --> 02:53:32.404]  Alex, I wish I could just pinpoint my hand on exactly what they think.
[02:53:32.485 --> 02:53:35.866]  I do think that they want to bring back COVID for two reasons.
[02:53:35.986 --> 02:53:41.908]  Of course, the election is coming, so mail-in ballots would be a great idea if everybody's locked up in their houses.
[02:53:42.308 --> 02:53:44.629]  And then the second thing they want to do is crash the economy.
[02:53:44.729 --> 02:53:48.211]   You know that they've already introduced And that's what California says.
[02:53:48.030 --> 02:53:50.730]  already has their CBDC, they want to crash the economy.
[02:53:50.730 --> 02:53:54.010]   And then when people are desperate and don't have anywhere to go,
[02:53:54.010 --> 02:53:57.690]   they will introduce universal basic income or send out checks, and then they will tell you
[02:53:57.690 --> 02:54:01.410]   to take these checks in CBDC, which will start out like an app on your phone
[02:54:01.410 --> 02:54:05.690]   and will eventually be a little grain of rice in your skin that I believe is the mark of the beast.
[02:54:05.690 --> 02:54:06.530]  So this whole thing is about--
[02:54:06.530 --> 02:54:09.530]  And that's what California says, it's the same stuff.
[02:54:09.530 --> 02:54:10.350]  Yes.
[02:54:10.350 --> 02:54:16.729]   So we're working towards, they are working towards getting the mark of the beast.
[02:54:16.729 --> 02:54:20.889]  what they call it, their CBD scent to everybody's hand.
[02:54:20.916 --> 02:54:23.218]  It's already, this system is there already.
[02:54:23.618 --> 02:54:25.479]  They just have to crash the economy.
[02:54:25.740 --> 02:54:28.842]  Then when people are suffering and there's no food, of course, what about famine?
[02:54:28.862 --> 02:54:30.523]  They blame the collapse on the COVID.
[02:54:30.703 --> 02:54:32.405]  Yes, they'll blame it on COVID.
[02:54:32.645 --> 02:54:34.226]  They'll blame it on climate change.
[02:54:34.566 --> 02:54:37.689]  You hear a lot of billionaires right now talking about universal basic income.
[02:54:37.789 --> 02:54:39.271]  Oh, the fire was caused.
[02:54:39.511 --> 02:54:40.812]  Oh, the virus was caused.
[02:54:40.872 --> 02:54:42.093]  Yes, but every time it's them.
[02:54:42.133 --> 02:54:48.539]  So at the end of the day, they want to put, they want a little chip under your skin where it's going to have everything.
[02:54:48.659 --> 02:54:54.084]  The Bible talks about it in Revelation 13, verse 16 to 18, that nobody will be able to buy or sell without it.
[02:54:54.104 --> 02:54:55.245]  They want 15 minute cities.
[02:54:55.265 --> 02:54:55.965]  They want to lock up.
[02:54:56.326 --> 02:54:56.866]  They want to create.
[02:54:56.886 --> 02:55:13.211]   Because they're going to shut down Yes, so this whole thing about COVID, even, yeah, I believe that the election is part of their plan, but the bigger plan, and it's not just happening here.
[02:55:13.251 --> 02:55:14.571]  Look at what's happening in Nigeria.
[02:55:14.791 --> 02:55:16.651]  They're practically destroying Nigeria's economy.
[02:55:16.971 --> 02:55:17.592]  If you go to Nigeria...
[02:55:19.252 --> 02:55:22.554]  Yes, he spoke as a test, and I screamed and screamed to my friends in Nigeria.
[02:55:22.574 --> 02:55:24.315]  I went to medical school, they have a lot of friends there.
[02:55:24.595 --> 02:55:29.078]  I screamed to them, I said, get prepared, get food, start farming and everything.
[02:55:29.338 --> 02:55:31.960]  You won't believe what they're doing in Nigeria, Alex.
[02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:35.502]  People, there are no cars on the street because... Tell folks, tell them what's happening.
[02:55:36.182 --> 02:55:38.164]  Gasoline has gone up in Nigeria about five times.
[02:55:38.484 --> 02:55:41.667]  They started a few years ago and they told Nigerians to come and turn in their phones.
[02:55:41.948 --> 02:55:43.049]  They had to register their phones.
[02:55:43.069 --> 02:55:46.472]  So all Nigerians had to register their phones or else it would be cut down.
[02:55:46.872 --> 02:55:52.037]  Last year, they got up about November, December and they said everybody should bring in the old Naira notes.
[02:55:52.077 --> 02:55:53.298]  They'll give them new Naira notes.
[02:55:53.638 --> 02:55:58.563]  They swept trillions of Naira out of the system because Nigeria is a place where people do business by cash.
[02:55:58.983 --> 02:56:02.126]  They swept this out and then they refused to give people their Naira notes back.
[02:56:02.446 --> 02:56:07.068]  So people, their old parents have to now start figuring out how to transmit money electronically.
[02:56:07.108 --> 02:56:09.108]  And the same globalists are running that program, they admit.
[02:56:09.148 --> 02:56:09.228]  Yes!
[02:56:09.709 --> 02:56:12.409]  Not only that, they're trying... Even the UN admits Nigeria's the test.
[02:56:12.650 --> 02:56:13.290]  Yes, they are.
[02:56:13.310 --> 02:56:17.871]  So what was the Asian country, they got to go to carbon neutral five years ago, now they collapsed?
[02:56:18.552 --> 02:56:18.932]  I think it was...
[02:56:21.027 --> 02:56:21.928]  Sri Lanka?
[02:56:21.948 --> 02:56:22.128]  Yes.
[02:56:22.228 --> 02:56:23.489]  Now show the Sri Lankan riots.
[02:56:23.509 --> 02:56:25.431]  They know exactly what's happening.
[02:56:25.471 --> 02:56:26.952]  So you know what else they did in Nigeria?
[02:56:27.413 --> 02:56:30.856]  They ran an election and of course they installed a globalist.
[02:56:30.896 --> 02:56:33.458]  The guy that won the election in Nigeria didn't get it.
[02:56:33.738 --> 02:56:35.140]  Like here they installed a globalist.
[02:56:35.460 --> 02:56:38.563]  The minute they installed Tinubu, Bill Gates was back there.
[02:56:38.823 --> 02:56:43.147]  Their health secretary is one lady that used to work for the United Nations, a globalist.
[02:56:43.647 --> 02:56:47.150]   And now in Nigeria, So that's the angrier world.
[02:56:47.771 --> 02:56:47.951]  Yes.
[02:56:47.971 --> 02:56:52.033]  So the globalists think they're going to cut our resources off to make us mad.
[02:56:52.053 --> 02:56:52.133]  Yes.
[02:56:52.173 --> 02:56:55.095]  But if we know it's them, we get mad at them instead of ourselves.
[02:56:54.914 --> 02:57:00.274]   twice of its value. Not only that, they took away subsidies for gasoline, took away subsidies
[02:57:00.274 --> 02:57:05.714]   for diesel, took away subsidies for electricity. So that's the angrier world. So the globalists
[02:57:05.714 --> 02:57:08.003]  think they're going to cut our resources off to make us mad.
[02:57:08.003 --> 02:57:13.924]   But if we know it's them, we get mad at them instead of ourselves. How do we stop
[02:57:13.924 --> 02:57:18.194]   this? The first way that people need to do this is learn to be self-sufficient.
[02:57:18.274 --> 02:57:24.437]  Like I told people in Nigeria, start farming, get food, start farming and don't let these people take over.
[02:57:24.477 --> 02:57:29.059]  If you start farming and you get food because Nigeria has such fertile land but most people don't farm.
[02:57:29.480 --> 02:57:31.080]  And number two, do not comply.
[02:57:31.201 --> 02:57:36.243]  I saw in a vision, Alex, people lining up in Nigeria to go take the digital currency.
[02:57:36.503 --> 02:57:38.364]  I saw people lining up in Europe to go take it.
[02:57:38.384 --> 02:57:39.665]  So I know this thing is coming.
[02:57:39.945 --> 02:57:44.948]   So people have to be ready because they want to crash your economy and then when You have nowhere else to turn.
[02:57:44.968 --> 02:57:51.511]  You don't have food, you don't have anything, and you're suffering, and then they will come as the savior and tell you, okay, you get locked up in this 15-minute city.
[02:57:51.771 --> 02:57:53.071]  Look at what happened in Ohio.
[02:57:53.291 --> 02:57:58.754]  They say people that were involved in that spiel, they are now telling them to move to Cincinnati and stay in 15-minute city.
[02:57:58.934 --> 02:58:00.074]  Look at what happened in Maui.
[02:58:00.274 --> 02:58:03.956]  They are trying to burn down the place so that they can create... These people are demons.
[02:58:04.336 --> 02:58:08.658]  They want to destroy humanity, and those they don't kill, they want to control.
[02:58:08.758 --> 02:58:10.719]  And for those that don't get it, look at history.
[02:58:10.999 --> 02:58:11.159]  Yes.
[02:58:11.179 --> 02:58:13.662]  You have good times, then evil takes over, and it happens.
[02:58:14.202 --> 02:58:14.803]  This happens.
[02:58:15.103 --> 02:58:15.744]  And it resets.
[02:58:16.957 --> 02:58:17.417]  You know what?
[02:58:17.537 --> 02:58:18.658]  It resets, Alex.
[02:58:18.998 --> 02:58:23.760]  People think that Klaus Schwab, Yuval Noah, them demons, they think that they're going to run this Great Reset.
[02:58:23.880 --> 02:58:24.060]  No!
[02:58:24.440 --> 02:58:25.661]  There will be a Great Reset.
[02:58:25.721 --> 02:58:28.222]  I tell people, read your Bible all the way to the end of Revelation.
[02:58:28.462 --> 02:58:29.982]  The Great Reset is going to be done by God.
[02:58:30.363 --> 02:58:37.606]  God is going to come, take the church out of here, do a rapture, destroy this system, and remodel it, so they know where their end is.
[02:58:37.866 --> 02:58:41.887]  But right now, they want to destroy as many human beings as possible before God comes for them.
[02:58:41.988 --> 02:58:43.148]  There will be a Great Reset.
[02:58:43.408 --> 02:58:44.869]  It will be done by God, not by the devil.
[02:58:45.589 --> 02:58:46.170]  No, you're right.
[02:58:45.989 --> 02:58:47.989]  So they're playing God?
[02:58:47.989 --> 02:58:48.989]  Yes.
[02:58:48.989 --> 02:58:52.510]  They want, Elon Musk wants to put Neuralink in our head.
[02:58:52.510 --> 02:58:58.069]   Yuval Noah says that, you know, that they want surveillance to go under our skin.
[02:58:58.069 --> 02:59:02.430]   They want that human beings are hackable animals and they can hack the software of life and
[02:59:02.430 --> 02:59:05.548]  introduce a code in your brain that clashes.
[02:59:05.386 --> 02:59:09.106]   Trump said that there's not going to be fair elections anymore because what is the point
[02:59:09.106 --> 02:59:11.866]  where they can just program the elections?
[02:59:11.866 --> 02:59:14.026]  These people are not hiding this stuff anymore.
[02:59:14.026 --> 02:59:18.305]   Bill Gates says that they can kill 10 to 15 percent of the population by good vaccines.
[02:59:18.305 --> 02:59:19.586]  They are not hiding it.
[02:59:19.586 --> 02:59:20.586]  That's crazy.
[02:59:20.586 --> 02:59:24.386]   They have a metaphysical rule that they've got to tell us what we're going to do before
[02:59:24.948 --> 02:59:27.989]  By the way, Joe Rogan just sent me a really powerful video he's watching right now.
[02:59:28.489 --> 02:59:32.750]  I just sent the video, we're going to play that coming out of break, that Joe Rogan just sent me, dealing with Joe Biden.
[02:59:32.790 --> 02:59:39.132]  I want to talk about Trump, I want to talk about the world, I want to talk about Christ, with everything, with Dr. Stella Emanuel, an incredible lady.
[02:59:39.552 --> 02:59:42.673]  Everybody needs to go to her website and mark it down for telemedicine.
[02:59:43.473 --> 02:59:43.653]  Yes.
[02:59:43.713 --> 02:59:45.434]  For great supplements, for everything.
[02:59:45.514 --> 02:59:46.615]  Angie's a sponsor of the show.
[02:59:46.655 --> 02:59:47.595]  She's an amazing lady.

[03:00:11.859 --> 03:00:14.620]  We should bring up what's happening with Trump right now with Dr. Stella Emanuel.
[03:00:15.280 --> 03:00:23.103]  To serve on the board of a Ukrainian energy company facing serious corruption charges, you were the vice president running point on Ukraine.
[03:00:23.123 --> 03:00:27.004]  The average Joe hears that and says, that sounds fishy.
[03:00:27.144 --> 03:00:30.765]  What's your understanding of what your son was doing for an extraordinary amount of money?
[03:00:31.506 --> 03:00:32.926]  I don't know what he was doing.
[03:00:32.986 --> 03:00:34.167]  I know he was on the board.
[03:00:34.187 --> 03:00:36.587]  I found out he was on the board after he was on the board.
[03:00:36.607 --> 03:00:37.688]  And that was it.
[03:00:38.328 --> 03:00:40.229]  And there's nobody... Well, you've had a lot of time.
[03:00:40.289 --> 03:00:41.830]  Isn't this something you want to get to the bottom of?
[03:00:42.190 --> 03:00:43.631]  No, because I trust my son.
[03:00:44.092 --> 03:00:46.053]  But that doesn't pass the smell test.
[03:00:46.093 --> 03:00:48.454]  Like, when you're vice president, isn't there a higher standard?
[03:00:48.474 --> 03:00:50.715]  Don't you need to know what's happening with your family?
[03:00:50.776 --> 03:00:53.057]  Don't you need to put down some guardrails?
[03:00:53.837 --> 03:00:57.980]  Unless there was something that was... there was something on his face that was wrong.
[03:00:58.440 --> 03:01:00.902]  There was nothing on his face that was wrong.
[03:01:00.942 --> 03:01:05.484]  Look, if you want to talk about problems, you know, let's talk about Trump's family.
[03:01:06.585 --> 03:01:07.185]  I mean, come on.
[03:01:07.526 --> 03:01:07.826]  This is...
[03:01:10.086 --> 03:01:11.027]  These guys are amazing.
[03:01:12.328 --> 03:01:15.110]  So you think that everything that happened was kosher?
[03:01:15.531 --> 03:01:22.476]  You know there's not one single bit of evidence, not one little tiny bit, to suggest anything done was wrong.
[03:01:23.297 --> 03:01:23.798]  You know that.
[03:01:24.218 --> 03:01:25.579]  But you keep asking me these questions.
[03:01:25.639 --> 03:01:26.180]  It's okay.
[03:01:26.780 --> 03:01:29.322]  You know, you're doing what you have to do.
[03:01:30.123 --> 03:01:31.164]  But I'm not worried about it.
[03:01:31.364 --> 03:01:32.665]  Look, the American public knows me.
[03:01:33.286 --> 03:01:34.286]  Last one on this.
[03:01:35.968 --> 03:01:36.628]  Say you're elected.
[03:01:37.189 --> 03:01:37.970]  You're in office.
[03:01:38.534 --> 03:01:44.774]   What guardrails would you have to be sure that your son, your brother Jimmy doesn't do anything to trade?
[03:01:44.774 --> 03:01:51.494]   That was during the campaign, they stole the election, now it's all confirmed.
[03:01:51.494 --> 03:01:57.093]   Chinese communist agents. Dr. Sotomayor is our guest. Now let's talk about people getting ready.
[03:01:57.093 --> 03:02:04.694]   And I can't illustrate this any easier than the fact that I tested negative for COVID twice this week.
[03:02:04.854 --> 03:02:06.715]  You were here last week when I was first starting to get sick.
[03:02:07.256 --> 03:02:08.256]  I hardly ever get sick.
[03:02:08.577 --> 03:02:09.577]  I know what COVID feels like.
[03:02:09.637 --> 03:02:10.298]  Can't breathe.
[03:02:10.758 --> 03:02:11.679]  It's a different type of deal.
[03:02:12.079 --> 03:02:14.420]  I believe that I have one of these new variants, things that are going on.
[03:02:14.440 --> 03:02:15.661]  We see the hospitals all of it.
[03:02:15.941 --> 03:02:17.102]  There's definitely something going on.
[03:02:17.142 --> 03:02:18.023]  They know what's going on.
[03:02:20.084 --> 03:02:23.126]  I got on the inhalable steroids that you sent me.
[03:02:23.426 --> 03:02:24.006]  B-desonide, right?
[03:02:24.086 --> 03:02:25.387]  And what's the other one?
[03:02:25.587 --> 03:02:26.788]  B-desonide and Abiro.
[03:02:27.128 --> 03:02:28.148]  And it knocked it all out.
[03:02:28.509 --> 03:02:29.129]  And I didn't know why.
[03:02:29.489 --> 03:02:31.930]  Last week you're here, you're like, let me help you.
[03:02:31.950 --> 03:02:32.531]  I'll give it to you now.
[03:02:32.551 --> 03:02:33.611]  I'm like, no, I'm fine.
[03:02:34.171 --> 03:02:35.652]  And a few days ago, I'm like, give it to me.
[03:02:35.872 --> 03:02:36.553]  Instantly better.
[03:02:37.173 --> 03:02:38.374]  Took it last night.
[03:02:38.554 --> 03:02:40.256]  I could not do the show yesterday.
[03:02:40.796 --> 03:02:42.618]  I'm like 95% better today.
[03:02:42.638 --> 03:02:48.062]  I mean, this is so no-brainer, but they're not going to give people this at the hospitals, most of them.
[03:02:48.303 --> 03:03:00.813]  They're not going to tell the people, the doctors you've got, the telemedicine system you've got, they're ready to help people, not once they start getting sick and get sent away from the hospital to get sick and come back and put on a ventilator, but to get stockpiled beforehand.
[03:03:01.153 --> 03:03:06.614]   So now I'm going to ask you, to talk about how people go to drstellamd.com,
[03:03:06.614 --> 03:03:11.374]   use promo code Alex to get a 10% discount, in some cases even more depending on the product,
[03:03:11.374 --> 03:03:17.774]   drstellamd.com, tell people about your amazing line of products that are over the counter,
[03:03:17.774 --> 03:03:19.494]  but also the telemedicine you've got.
[03:03:19.494 --> 03:03:24.014]   Yeah, let's talk about the telemedicine first, because that's the most important part, you know?
[03:03:24.382 --> 03:03:30.148]  During Delta, we're seeing 700-800 patients a day calling prescriptions to pharmacies.
[03:03:30.208 --> 03:03:35.994]  Pharmacies will just cancel the scripts and then we'll be calling from 3-4 pharmacies to just get prescriptions to people.
[03:03:36.454 --> 03:03:37.254]  We're going through a lot.
[03:03:37.314 --> 03:03:43.717]  So we called, in fact, I think I came on Alex Show at that time, and we called and we said, get patients out there.
[03:03:43.957 --> 03:03:48.939]  And, you know, we called, like I said, mom and pop pharmacies from all over the country.
[03:03:49.299 --> 03:03:53.160]  And these mom and pop pharmacies, they came on and they joined our team.
[03:03:53.240 --> 03:04:00.343]  And we created a team with mom and pop pharmacies all over the country that will ship these medications directly to your house.
[03:04:00.843 --> 03:04:21.527]  So what you really do is that you go on DrStellaMD.com, you do a telemedicine appointment, you fill all your medical information, we review it, our nurses call you, we review all your information, look at your allergies, your weight, and all that, and then we prescribe the medication according to your medical history, according to your weight, according to, you know, other medications that you're taking.
[03:04:21.927 --> 03:04:25.728]  And then we ship it to you, and then you take it and you keep it in your medicine cabinet.
[03:04:25.768 --> 03:04:42.221]   We have a package we've put together called Yes, it has hydroxychloroquine, it has ivermectin, it has budesonide, and it has this cute little nebulizer that we created that you can actually just charge it with your power bank, you know?
[03:04:42.521 --> 03:04:47.426]  So you get the nebulizer, so it gets you Z-Pak, and then you get the steroids that you need.
[03:04:47.466 --> 03:04:49.788]  So you have everything that you need if you get sick.
[03:04:50.248 --> 03:04:54.653]  So we, and then when we give that to you, if you get sick you can call us and we can direct you if you need direction.
[03:04:54.953 --> 03:04:57.015]  But everything is done and given you with direction.
[03:04:57.056 --> 03:05:05.465]  So you keep it in your medicine cabinet so that when you get sick, by the time you get sick and you call us and it takes three days to ship to you, you're sick and you're scared and you're terrified.
[03:05:05.745 --> 03:05:10.951]  So I tell people that please, I am screaming from the rooftop, America please listen to me.
[03:05:11.391 --> 03:05:15.273]  Get Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin in your medicine cabinet right now.
[03:05:15.593 --> 03:05:20.976]  Some people just get Ivermectin, some people just get Hydroxychloroquine, some people get the whole COVID complete pack.
[03:05:21.376 --> 03:05:30.460]  But while we can help you, while you're still alive and strong and can do it, do it now, now, today.
[03:05:30.920 --> 03:05:31.881]  Get it in your medicine cabinet.
[03:05:31.901 --> 03:05:33.742]  Before they're choking you to death.
[03:05:33.982 --> 03:05:37.183]  Yeah, before they decide to shut down the internet or something.
[03:05:38.604 --> 03:05:40.866]  The way we work, Alex, everything we do is legal.
[03:05:40.886 --> 03:05:41.567]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:05:41.807 --> 03:05:44.009]  Our licensing and everything is very great.
[03:05:44.029 --> 03:05:44.549]  It's very legal.
[03:05:44.569 --> 03:05:50.695]  So we have to go through everything that we need to make sure that we're getting everything done for you properly.
[03:05:51.015 --> 03:05:53.017]  We go through your medical record.
[03:05:53.057 --> 03:05:53.978]  We take a review.
[03:05:54.018 --> 03:05:55.599]   So everything is done Fine.
[03:05:55.660 --> 03:06:01.847]  And we can see patients, we have doctors that can see patients in all 50 states and pharmacies that can ship to you in all 50 states.
[03:06:01.867 --> 03:06:04.950]  So that's why I'm saying, America, please just listen to me.
[03:06:05.210 --> 03:06:07.693]  People call me all the time to come and get them out of hospital.
[03:06:07.713 --> 03:06:11.397]  People call me all the time crying because somebody's in the hospital and you don't know what to do.
[03:06:11.638 --> 03:06:15.698]   People call me, people come to us when they're already too sick and you're
[03:06:15.698 --> 03:06:20.068]   coughing and you're going through this and then at the end of the day you might end up with COVID
[03:06:20.068 --> 03:06:22.378]   lung symptoms and your lungs are...
[03:06:22.378 --> 03:06:26.577]   And we saw what Fauci and them did trying to block the therapeutics because they can't
[03:06:26.577 --> 03:06:30.179]   have the panic if we're prepared and God gave us the compounds.
[03:06:30.179 --> 03:06:31.179]  Yes.
[03:06:31.179 --> 03:06:33.378]   Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin have been around for years.
[03:06:33.734 --> 03:06:35.175]  They are safe medications.
[03:06:35.495 --> 03:06:38.017]  They are over-the-counter in many countries.
[03:06:38.397 --> 03:06:41.219]  It's only in this country where you... Talk about that.
[03:06:41.239 --> 03:06:44.722]  I'll bring this up because you're from Africa.
[03:06:44.742 --> 03:06:45.862]  6% of Africans took the shot.
[03:06:46.383 --> 03:06:47.724]  That's a global UN poll.
[03:06:48.064 --> 03:06:50.606]  They had the lowest COVID rate of the world.
[03:06:50.626 --> 03:06:55.269]  It was like less than 1% because the Africans, I guess, already knew about these drugs.
[03:06:55.612 --> 03:06:56.413]  Yes, listen.
[03:06:56.453 --> 03:06:57.013]  Talk about that.
[03:06:57.334 --> 03:06:58.475]  You know, malaria.
[03:06:59.135 --> 03:07:01.798]  Most places that are malaria endemic do not get COVID like that.
[03:07:02.319 --> 03:07:05.862]  So, when COVID left Wuhan, China, I was going all over the world.
[03:07:06.302 --> 03:07:08.445]  It seeded into Nigeria at the same time.
[03:07:08.465 --> 03:07:11.888]  You cannot social distance in the slums of Ajegunde.
[03:07:12.208 --> 03:07:15.692]  But when COVID got into Nigeria, people were leaving Wuhan to Nigeria.
[03:07:15.731 --> 03:07:20.111]   they were forced to take anti-malarias and he knocked the COVID out of their system.
[03:07:20.111 --> 03:07:25.291]   And even when people got COVID in back home, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, camoquinine,
[03:07:25.291 --> 03:07:26.971]  mefloquine, they're all over the counter.
[03:07:26.971 --> 03:07:30.731]   So when people get malaria or they get any kind of fever, - They already know.
[03:07:30.731 --> 03:07:33.031]  The first thing they do is treat it for malaria.
[03:07:33.031 --> 03:07:35.811]  And when they treat it for malaria, it knocks out the COVID.
[03:07:35.811 --> 03:07:40.211]   So it's not just hydroxychloroquine that treats COVID, it's most of the quinolones like, you know,
[03:07:40.211 --> 03:07:44.251]   mefloquine, flavoquine, camoquinine, they're all, quinine, they all work.
[03:07:44.251 --> 03:07:46.251]  Some of them have more side effects.
[03:07:46.159 --> 03:07:46.819]  What do they do?
[03:07:46.859 --> 03:07:47.960]  What's the active thing?
[03:07:49.440 --> 03:07:50.680]  You know, it's the quinine.
[03:07:50.720 --> 03:07:58.322]  The old days, the British knew to give their sailors limes so they wouldn't get scurvy, and they knew to put in their gin the quinine.
[03:07:58.462 --> 03:08:00.303]  They had scientists.
[03:08:00.643 --> 03:08:02.464]  That's how the British beat everybody.
[03:08:02.904 --> 03:08:03.884]  Because nobody else had it.
[03:08:04.665 --> 03:08:06.066]  Explain that to people that don't know.
[03:08:06.246 --> 03:08:16.089]  You know quinine itself is a little more toxic than mefloquine which is a little more toxic than you know but hydroxychloroquine is like one of the safest versions of the quinine.
[03:08:16.109 --> 03:08:25.709]   So even if you don't have access to doctors, go get classic gin tonic? Yeah I guess but I can't say that. You're a
[03:08:25.709 --> 03:08:26.829]  doctor but it's the low end.
[03:08:26.829 --> 03:08:32.188]   Yes but there are people that survived COVID just taking you know tonic
[03:08:32.188 --> 03:08:36.548]   water you know so but I'm just saying to people that this stuff you know. That's why
[03:08:36.548 --> 03:08:39.388]  you call it a tonic.
[03:08:37.727 --> 03:08:39.208]  All these doctors gave you a tonic.
[03:08:39.328 --> 03:08:41.889]  Do you know what made me start using hydroxychloroquine, Alex?
[03:08:42.170 --> 03:08:44.871]  It was an article that was published under Anthony Fauci.
[03:08:44.891 --> 03:08:45.912]  You can go Google this.
[03:08:46.232 --> 03:08:50.655]  In 2005, that said chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-1.
[03:08:51.055 --> 03:08:55.098]  So that is where we don't even need any more thing to even use this medicine.
[03:08:55.318 --> 03:08:56.099]  So let's start there.
[03:08:56.219 --> 03:08:58.220]  What is in a tonic water?
[03:08:58.300 --> 03:08:59.481]  What is quinine?
[03:08:59.701 --> 03:09:00.382]  What does quinine do?
[03:09:00.761 --> 03:09:07.401]   quinine comes from the back of a tree. That is where all these quinolones are made from.
[03:09:07.401 --> 03:09:11.241]   They are all derivatives of quinine. So the British just knew what worked, keeping their
[03:09:11.241 --> 03:09:16.841]   troops operating in the jungle. Yes. And a lot of, sometimes back home people make teas out of this.
[03:09:16.841 --> 03:09:23.161]   If you go on our website, right now we're putting together what we call medicinal herbs. We will
[03:09:23.161 --> 03:09:30.041]   have lemongrass and moringa and all those things, mint. So they have, when we're growing up, if you
[03:09:30.041 --> 03:09:32.041]  You got sick, they had like...
[03:09:32.403 --> 03:09:40.470]  They had, they, like, boiled all these herbs and then they covered you with it and you just breathe in all these herbs that they just boiled and you- And that was done in America!
[03:09:40.610 --> 03:09:40.871]  Yes.
[03:09:41.031 --> 03:09:43.313]  Even back in the time of my grandmothers, they would just cover you with herbs.
[03:09:43.673 --> 03:09:43.953]  Yes.
[03:09:44.294 --> 03:09:46.356]  And you just boil this up and you breathe it, you know?
[03:09:46.676 --> 03:09:57.305]  So, that is why COVID didn't really seep into Africa because they have all these things that they do when you get fevers and, of course, you don't- Well, since you're a medical doctor, but also, also like a shaman, you know all this stuff.
[03:09:58.543 --> 03:10:14.640]  My father, first born to my grandmother, was super sickly because they kept him so clean and everything, and his black nanny said, you need Hindu tea, which I guess was boiled chicken poop, and she gave it to him one time, and two, he was never sick again.
[03:10:15.241 --> 03:10:17.003]  And I guess that had antibodies or something in it.
[03:10:17.343 --> 03:10:18.404]  Have you ever heard of that?
[03:10:18.924 --> 03:10:19.924]  not Hindu tea.
[03:10:19.924 --> 03:10:23.284]  I'm just saying there's a lot of secret stuff.
[03:10:23.284 --> 03:10:29.244]   Yes, I know that because I had a meeting with one of the doctors, the naturopathic doctors,
[03:10:29.244 --> 03:10:32.804]   because in fact she's the one that produced what we call pox defense.
[03:10:32.804 --> 03:10:37.684]   And pox defense, we got it from, we found it, we actually found it on the NIH website.
[03:10:37.684 --> 03:10:44.643]   During the times of smallpox, how they had this plant, you know, pitcher plant that they
[03:10:44.643 --> 03:10:47.884]  use, the Indians use for smallpox and they got healed.
[03:10:47.884 --> 03:10:50.924]   That's how we put together pox defense, you know, Sericinia purpura.
[03:10:50.924 --> 03:10:53.003]  This is something you can buy over the counter.
[03:10:53.003 --> 03:10:56.084]  So we put these things together.
[03:10:56.059 --> 03:11:03.941]  Alex, I have gone past just doing medicine, like a doctor treating disease, to like realizing that you have to get people healthy.
[03:11:04.301 --> 03:11:13.984]  Like you see, I tell people right now, one of the biggest things that you should do, apart from getting hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in your medicine cabinet, is to get vitamin C, D, zinc.
[03:11:14.004 --> 03:11:17.305]  I was about to say, so what do you get in case you start getting sick?
[03:11:18.025 --> 03:11:18.865]  That's telemedicine.
[03:11:19.165 --> 03:11:21.066]  But what do you get to prevent it up front and be healthy?
[03:11:21.326 --> 03:11:21.606]  I would.
[03:11:21.927 --> 03:11:23.789]  This is, you know, this thing called Covivite.
[03:11:24.169 --> 03:11:26.351]  It has vitamins C, D, Zinc, and Quercetin.
[03:11:26.372 --> 03:11:27.192]  We have a lot of supplements.
[03:11:27.653 --> 03:11:29.195]  Vitamins C, D, Zinc, and Quercetin.
[03:11:29.495 --> 03:11:31.397]  Zinc is a potent antiviral.
[03:11:31.897 --> 03:11:34.800]  I tell people don't take more than maybe 30 to 50 milligrams a day.
[03:11:34.820 --> 03:11:38.204]  So people need to go to DrCellMD.com, which is also a great sponsor.
[03:11:38.665 --> 03:11:40.867]  And what do they get to boost their immune system and their overall health?
[03:11:40.967 --> 03:11:43.530]  We have this thing we call the Plandemic Pack.
[03:11:44.010 --> 03:11:45.312]  We have daily immune boosts.
[03:11:45.572 --> 03:11:46.694]  We have all kinds of packages.
[03:11:46.994 --> 03:11:48.315]  Like see, COVIDVice is a big one.
[03:11:48.616 --> 03:11:55.604]  The Covita Spray, this little spray, has quercetin, it has vitamin D, it has neem in it, so it helps with allergies.
[03:11:56.164 --> 03:12:01.708]  I was about to say, because Dr. McCullough and others have said, in most cases, just an inhalable spray stops it up front.
[03:12:01.728 --> 03:12:04.550]  Yeah, so this spray, we went to Reawakening America.
[03:12:04.570 --> 03:12:05.971]  I know how dusty Las Vegas is.
[03:12:06.031 --> 03:12:07.352]  Everybody was just coughing dusty.
[03:12:07.632 --> 03:12:14.137]  We just came, just sprayed it, and within like five minutes, you just feel like all that junk, you just dissolve out of your system.
[03:12:14.177 --> 03:12:19.040]  So, there are many medicinal things that we can do that is not big pharma medicine.
[03:12:19.160 --> 03:12:20.642]  I'm not knocking big pharma medicine.
[03:12:20.662 --> 03:12:21.182]  I'm a physician.
[03:12:21.202 --> 03:12:22.083]  You understand what I'm saying?
[03:12:22.103 --> 03:12:23.764]  I know hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin works.
[03:12:24.224 --> 03:12:32.430]  But if you can take Vitamin C, D, Zinc, and Quercetin, build your immunity, elderberry, milk, thistle, all this stuff, build your immunity before you get sick.
[03:12:32.730 --> 03:12:37.373]  The reason why a lot of people get colds in the winter is because of low Vitamin D. You know what I'm saying?
[03:12:37.773 --> 03:12:44.998]  Vitamin C helps with colds and membranes, and Zinc is a very potent antiviral, but Zinc cannot enter into your cell.
[03:12:45.158 --> 03:12:46.279]  That's where you need Quercetin.
[03:12:46.619 --> 03:12:52.463]  So when we put Zinc and Quercetin and Vitamin D together, you have a combination that can keep you healthy.
[03:12:52.523 --> 03:12:53.664]  We have it in COVID Vites.
[03:12:54.444 --> 03:12:54.905]  One pill.
[03:12:55.185 --> 03:12:55.745]  You can take it.
[03:12:55.766 --> 03:12:57.387]  You have vitamin C, D, Zinc, and Quercetin.
[03:12:57.407 --> 03:12:58.288]  You can buy it over the counter.
[03:12:58.528 --> 03:13:01.251]  But if you go on our website, you can get it in Covivite.
[03:13:01.591 --> 03:13:02.752]  Then take it daily.
[03:13:03.012 --> 03:13:05.074]  We also have NAC, endocytosis 16.
[03:13:05.394 --> 03:13:06.635]  That is an antioxidant.
[03:13:06.675 --> 03:13:08.717]  Helps to break loose mucus out of your chest.
[03:13:09.078 --> 03:13:10.699]  So we have all these things we've built.
[03:13:10.719 --> 03:13:14.663]  We've spent the past three years developing stuff to help people stay healthy.
[03:13:15.063 --> 03:13:23.127]  And then of course, you make a telehealth appointment, put your medicine in your medicine cabinet, and you know that if something crazy happens, while you fight, you can stand.
[03:13:23.167 --> 03:13:25.188]  Because I don't want people to fight and then they can't breathe.
[03:13:25.648 --> 03:13:27.369]  And the key is use promo code Alex.
[03:13:27.549 --> 03:13:29.370]  Use promo code Alex, you get a discount.
[03:13:29.811 --> 03:13:31.531]  What's the discount?
[03:13:31.872 --> 03:13:32.352]  It depends.
[03:13:32.372 --> 03:13:33.252]  5% to 10% depends.
[03:13:34.413 --> 03:13:37.274]  Well, they're great products and everybody loves them here.
[03:13:38.455 --> 03:13:43.858]  Politically though, watching this, why would they attempt another lockdown, which they now confirm they're doing?
[03:13:44.673 --> 03:13:45.273]  Two reasons.
[03:13:46.054 --> 03:13:49.015]  One, they want to do mail-in ballots for the next election.
[03:13:49.636 --> 03:13:57.020]  Number two, they want to crash the economy so that they can bring universal basic income and make us take it in CBDC or the Mark of the Beast.
[03:13:57.240 --> 03:13:58.040]  That's what's going on.
[03:13:58.601 --> 03:13:58.921]  Period.
[03:13:59.201 --> 03:14:00.842]  They want everybody digitalized by 2020.
[03:14:01.482 --> 03:14:04.524]  United Nations is talking about a digital compact.
[03:14:04.584 --> 03:14:07.266]  And they're going to use the fear of disease to do it.
[03:14:08.126 --> 03:14:08.326]  Yes.
[03:14:08.686 --> 03:14:15.070]  So if they destroy the economy, do you know how many people, if they say, okay, great, come and get $2,000 right now, you don't have to work.
[03:14:15.370 --> 03:14:18.492]  Many people will succumb and say, okay, God, inject it in my body.
[03:14:18.512 --> 03:14:21.334]  People are already injecting into their body for just convenience.
[03:14:21.474 --> 03:14:24.356]  And that is the bottom line, where this thing is going.
[03:14:24.436 --> 03:14:27.617]  This thing is going to a time when there'll be a digital dictatorship.
[03:14:27.638 --> 03:14:34.321]  You're not going to be able to buy or sell till you have a chip under your finger, chip under your hand or in your forehead, as the Bible says in Revelation 13, 16.
[03:14:35.382 --> 03:14:37.063]  So they're working towards it.
[03:14:37.444 --> 03:14:40.386]  And the only way that they will succeed is if we follow them.
[03:14:40.706 --> 03:14:45.729]  But if you resist, they can also force... Look at how much resistance stopped them from all the masks and lockdowns.
[03:14:45.749 --> 03:14:47.330]  Look at how we exposed it two weeks ago.
[03:14:47.350 --> 03:14:47.410]  Yes.
[03:14:47.511 --> 03:14:50.032]  And it's already... So I'm going to tell the truth here.
[03:14:50.693 --> 03:14:52.634]  And I thought why I haven't told these stories.
[03:14:53.175 --> 03:14:54.776]  It's not because I'm ashamed of it.
[03:14:55.595 --> 03:14:57.597]  But I don't want to look arrogant or powerful.
[03:14:57.958 --> 03:14:59.660]  And I'm serious when I say that.
[03:15:00.080 --> 03:15:01.422]  But I've had visions as well.
[03:15:02.303 --> 03:15:04.685]  And I had visions of the World Trade Centers blowing up.
[03:15:05.066 --> 03:15:06.528]  And I'm on record saying they're going to blow them up.
[03:15:06.608 --> 03:15:08.210]  And they blame it on Bin Laden and all that.
[03:15:08.510 --> 03:15:09.351]  I'm saying Bin Laden's good.
[03:15:09.371 --> 03:15:10.072]  That's my vision.
[03:15:10.512 --> 03:15:11.934]  And I said it months before it happened.
[03:15:11.974 --> 03:15:12.534]  It's on record.
[03:15:13.135 --> 03:15:15.958]  But I've also had visions in the last four or five years before this started.
[03:15:17.102 --> 03:15:23.686]  of lockdowns and forced injections and troops on the street and the power going off and you wake up with these dreams that are incredible.
[03:15:23.887 --> 03:15:24.027]  Yes.
[03:15:24.067 --> 03:15:25.648]  And you go, oh, I'll remember this.
[03:15:25.828 --> 03:15:30.651]  And by the time you get up and you know, I'll be honest, go take a pee and drink a cup of coffee.
[03:15:30.671 --> 03:15:31.331]  You can't remember it.
[03:15:31.552 --> 03:15:35.854]  Well, usually I record them because mine have been, I saw it from way back.
[03:15:35.874 --> 03:15:37.315]  Do you get your visions and dreams or what?
[03:15:37.335 --> 03:15:38.616]  I get them in dreams and visions.
[03:15:38.656 --> 03:15:41.858]  Sometimes when I'm praying, I'm like in really deep prayer and everything.
[03:15:42.179 --> 03:15:44.100]  I see visions like passing.
[03:15:44.120 --> 03:15:44.480]  Exactly.
[03:15:44.500 --> 03:15:45.901]  My problem is then I can't remember them.
[03:15:46.081 --> 03:15:47.682]  So how do you remember them?
[03:15:48.042 --> 03:15:48.502]  I record them.
[03:15:48.542 --> 03:15:49.822]  I have a recording system on my phone.
[03:15:49.842 --> 03:15:50.703]  When I wake up, I record them.
[03:15:50.723 --> 03:15:51.823]  I'm going to give you the floor right now.
[03:15:51.843 --> 03:15:53.264]  You're going to host the next five minutes.
[03:15:53.344 --> 03:15:54.944]  I'm not going to interrupt you.
[03:15:55.464 --> 03:15:57.425]  Tell us, because I know these visions are gifts from God.
[03:15:57.445 --> 03:15:57.865]  They're real.
[03:15:58.025 --> 03:15:58.205]  Yes.
[03:15:58.605 --> 03:15:59.946]  Folks, on my shoulder, this is real.
[03:15:59.966 --> 03:16:00.846]  Everybody has them yourself.
[03:16:01.166 --> 03:16:03.167]  The great part is the visions are increasing for everybody.
[03:16:03.519 --> 03:16:04.379]  Yes, God is talking to people.
[03:16:04.419 --> 03:16:05.420]  Yes, God is talking to people.
[03:16:05.460 --> 03:16:06.740]  God is talking to people, Alex.
[03:16:06.859 --> 03:16:13.099]   They're getting burned buildings down, raped children, attacked things, lie, attacked,
[03:16:13.099 --> 03:16:14.099]  they're getting their vision.
[03:16:14.099 --> 03:16:16.019]  What vision are you getting Dr. Steele-Emanuel?
[03:16:16.019 --> 03:16:17.378]  God is talking to people Alex.
[03:16:17.378 --> 03:16:22.378]   I remember in 2016 when the Lord showed me this whole pandemic, it was like I saw like
[03:16:22.378 --> 03:16:26.139]   there was a fork going all over the nation and people were coughing and coughing and
[03:16:26.139 --> 03:16:29.019]  just having like respiratory symptoms and coughing.
[03:16:29.069 --> 03:16:30.610]  And I was asking people, what do we do?
[03:16:30.750 --> 03:16:32.431]  And the Lord is like, we need to pray.
[03:16:32.471 --> 03:16:33.832]  People need to cry out to God.
[03:16:34.172 --> 03:16:38.353]  We've had the 2011, we did a 100 day prayer program.
[03:16:38.374 --> 03:16:39.274]  We played round the clock.
[03:16:39.654 --> 03:16:43.939]  And the Lord showed me that there were people among us that are not human, people that are among us that way.
[03:16:44.060 --> 03:16:49.546]  And they told me that it was not their time, and when is their time they were going to take over.
[03:16:50.067 --> 03:16:56.274]  And so as you keep having these visions, you start thinking about, you start praying and crying out to God and saying, God, what's going to happen to our generation?
[03:16:56.855 --> 03:17:02.140]  And right now, that is why when all these things started happening, I said, Oh God, these are the things that the Lord has been showing me.
[03:17:02.580 --> 03:17:07.344]  But I remember in 2020, in March, when this whole thing started, I did a video about this.
[03:17:07.424 --> 03:17:08.465]  It's on my YouTube channel.
[03:17:08.765 --> 03:17:10.547]  If you go on my YouTube channel, it's right there.
[03:17:10.627 --> 03:17:11.788]  I did it, I think it was March 15, 2020.
[03:17:13.169 --> 03:17:16.832]  And when all this started, and I went to the Lord praying, I said, God, what is going on?
[03:17:16.892 --> 03:17:17.913]  What's going on with our world?
[03:17:18.493 --> 03:17:29.784]  And I had this really strange dream and in this dream I saw like, there was like satellites or some, they were like rays being released on the earth and these rays were hitting people and many people were dying.
[03:17:30.324 --> 03:17:33.527]  By then nobody had died and I called, I said we should pray.
[03:17:33.567 --> 03:17:39.052]  I called for a million people to get together and pray because we didn't know what was going to happen or what was going to come.
[03:17:39.472 --> 03:17:43.997]  And I was calling, I said people need to pray because evil is coming on the world and this was before anybody died.
[03:17:44.477 --> 03:17:48.398]  And of course, our generation right now don't really know how to pray and intercede.
[03:17:48.858 --> 03:17:51.638]  And what the vision that the Lord showed me came to pass.
[03:17:51.698 --> 03:18:06.761]  You know, people died and I still believe that what I saw, this contrapture that I saw in the heavenlies that was releasing rays upon humanity as I now think it has something to do maybe 5G or some of these directed weapons that are coming on the earth.
[03:18:07.381 --> 03:18:09.761]  And I don't think that these globalists have stopped.
[03:18:10.082 --> 03:18:12.202]  I want everybody listening to me to know that.
[03:18:12.842 --> 03:18:17.385]  We're like in the end times, so you need to be prepared physically, you need to be prepared spiritually.
[03:18:17.926 --> 03:18:19.827]  Why do you need to be prepared spiritually?
[03:18:20.247 --> 03:18:21.408]  They're going to release weapons.
[03:18:21.808 --> 03:18:40.581]   If you read Revelation 6, as the seals are being opened, seal number one that is open in Revelation 6 verse 1 to 3 is actually The Concaro is released all over the world and I believe this seal was opened in 2020 and the Concaro was released to conquer the whole world.
[03:18:40.941 --> 03:18:42.082]  It was given two things.
[03:18:42.122 --> 03:18:50.908]  It was given a crown and a they say a crown and a bow and actually some versions call it a poisonous dart.
[03:18:51.068 --> 03:18:53.410]  I do believe that the crown is Corona.
[03:18:53.450 --> 03:18:57.612]  Corona actually means crown and the poisonous dart or the bow was the jab.
[03:18:57.933 --> 03:18:59.874]  These are the two things that the devil was given.
[03:19:00.254 --> 03:19:01.495]  To conquer the whole world.
[03:19:01.595 --> 03:19:03.475]  And I do believe this year was open in 2020.
[03:19:03.895 --> 03:19:08.017]  And I want everybody to realize that it's the Lord Jesus that was opening the seals.
[03:19:08.377 --> 03:19:10.778]  Why would the Lord open seals and release calamity on the world?
[03:19:11.178 --> 03:19:12.639]  Because our iniquity is full.
[03:19:13.019 --> 03:19:14.619]  The world right now is full.
[03:19:14.639 --> 03:19:15.500]  The iniquity is full.
[03:19:15.520 --> 03:19:19.640]   there's a lot of depravity in the world and the world is due for judgment.
[03:19:19.640 --> 03:19:22.779]   If God does not judge our world, then he has to answer to Sodom and Gomorrah.
[03:19:22.779 --> 03:19:27.439]   And we that are the righteous people are the ones that are holding the hands of God,
[03:19:27.439 --> 03:19:29.779]  holding the hands of judgment over the nations.
[03:19:29.779 --> 03:19:35.199]   That is why it's so important that we pray and fast and stand before God for our nation,
[03:19:35.199 --> 03:19:37.159]  stand before God for our families.
[03:19:37.159 --> 03:19:43.440]   And I know that in the next, something is gonna happen, an event called the rapture is gonna happen
[03:19:43.440 --> 03:19:47.280]   when the Lord is gonna come and take the church out so that they can destroy these demons.
[03:19:46.974 --> 03:19:48.055]  God is going to settle this.
[03:19:48.475 --> 03:19:50.616]  So you have to make sure that your life is right.
[03:19:50.656 --> 03:19:51.556]  You believe in Jesus.
[03:19:51.796 --> 03:19:58.059]  Your life is right with Christ and make sure that when the Lord comes, he takes you out and then these demons will be destroyed.
[03:19:58.139 --> 03:20:04.162]  After these demons are destroyed, we're going to, God is going to come back, remodel this world and we'll live happily ever after on this earth.
[03:20:04.582 --> 03:20:08.204]  But between now and then, there's going to be a lot of pain and suffering.
[03:20:08.484 --> 03:20:09.944]  There's going to be a lot of starvation.
[03:20:10.324 --> 03:20:23.610]  Prepare food, stock up water, be prepared to stand, live your life right with God, make sure that you're taking supplements, make sure that you have, you know, charcoal grill, guns and ammo, whatever it is that it will take for you to protect you and your family.
[03:20:24.030 --> 03:20:25.110]  And you've done that yourself.
[03:20:25.150 --> 03:20:26.031]  You've moved out of the country.
[03:20:26.551 --> 03:20:26.752]  Oh yeah.
[03:20:26.772 --> 03:20:27.813]  I have a big ranch.
[03:20:27.834 --> 03:20:29.697]  I have two ranches actually.
[03:20:29.817 --> 03:20:31.901]  A personal one and the one that we use for other things, yeah.
[03:20:32.281 --> 03:20:33.203]  But it's incredible.
[03:20:33.624 --> 03:20:35.166]  You can see evils out in the open.
[03:20:35.266 --> 03:20:37.170]  Open pedophilia, open satanism.
[03:20:37.450 --> 03:20:38.532]  The main move is happening.
[03:20:39.861 --> 03:20:42.483]  The devil is actually just out in the open, you know?
[03:20:42.963 --> 03:20:53.451]  You know, Alex, this whole issue about, uh, you know, hairy, stanky men dressed up like demons, you know, dancing with their tutus in front of children, it is not, it is, it's, it's not harmless.
[03:20:53.931 --> 03:20:56.473]  That is how they introduce satanic ritual.
[03:20:56.753 --> 03:20:57.674]  Yes, it's a ritual.
[03:20:57.874 --> 03:21:04.620]  They introduce these demons into these children at this age, and then by the time they are 8 or 9, they are now dead, or they don't know what they are.
[03:21:04.640 --> 03:21:05.160]  They're grooming them.
[03:21:05.200 --> 03:21:09.904]  Yes, so they are grooming them, not just physically, but spiritually, introducing demonic spirits.
[03:21:09.924 --> 03:21:12.727]  And by the way, they go to city councils and say, we're here to groom your children.
[03:21:12.847 --> 03:21:13.147]  Yes.
[03:21:13.167 --> 03:21:14.388]  Like Disney World has them.
[03:21:14.428 --> 03:21:15.249]  For your children, yes.
[03:21:15.749 --> 03:21:18.130]  So people, parents have to be very careful.
[03:21:18.510 --> 03:21:19.911]  Teach your children, train them.
[03:21:20.631 --> 03:21:25.654]  Right now in California, they want you to have, they talk about, you know, sex with minors, if the minor accepts.
[03:21:25.954 --> 03:21:28.275]  You need to teach your children that way in an evil time.
[03:21:28.555 --> 03:21:31.377]  So they don't go to school and they mock them without telling you.
[03:21:31.397 --> 03:21:34.598]  So they don't go to school and the teacher teach them something crazy.
[03:21:34.818 --> 03:21:37.360]  In fact, I would say get your children out of school, do home schooling.
[03:21:37.400 --> 03:21:37.920]  Exactly.
[03:21:37.940 --> 03:21:39.421]  Do home schooling, yes.
[03:21:39.481 --> 03:21:41.882]  Nothing matters but our souls and protecting our children.
[03:21:42.382 --> 03:21:46.064]  People need to get ready with the telemedicine and get pre-stocked.
[03:21:46.084 --> 03:21:47.464]  They all seem to get the supplements right now.

[03:23:46.886 --> 03:23:47.646]  Do not be scared.
[03:23:47.766 --> 03:23:48.746]  Do not be scared.
[03:23:48.847 --> 03:23:49.447]  Be prepared.
[03:23:49.467 --> 03:23:50.187]  That's all I'm saying.
[03:23:50.507 --> 03:23:58.672]  Whatever battles that they're throwing at us, if you're spiritually prepared, if you're physically prepared, like I said, it is the paranoid that will survive in this time.
[03:23:59.012 --> 03:24:05.275]  And if you're paranoid like me, you'll have everything from food, from water, to spiritual health, and to medical health.
[03:24:05.315 --> 03:24:09.577]  So once you are in that position, help your family, your friends, everybody to be prepared.
[03:24:09.597 --> 03:24:11.678]  And the most important thing is you've got great people around you.
[03:24:11.778 --> 03:24:12.699]  Yes, yes.
[03:24:12.859 --> 03:24:14.420]  And call on the name of Jesus.
[03:24:15.200 --> 03:24:17.301]  Drive safe back to Houston.
[03:24:18.021 --> 03:24:20.002]  DrStellaMD.com folks.

[03:24:45.296 --> 03:25:00.568]  Join Mug Club and get one month free with promo code ALEX at jonescrowder.com Now we're about to play you a clip from a well-known prestigious doctor, Dr. Roger Hodkinson, laying out some of the latest numbers.
[03:25:00.628 --> 03:25:02.890]  These are hard, cold numbers.
[03:25:03.271 --> 03:25:04.031]  See this for yourself.
[03:25:04.452 --> 03:25:17.238]   One of the big pieces of news over the last couple of days has been a A substack by a gentleman called Peter Halligan.
[03:25:18.178 --> 03:25:26.341]  Peter Halligan has been looking, he's a most experienced analyst in the financial industry.
[03:25:27.082 --> 03:25:35.325]  Extremely used to looking at statistics and translating them into a summary statement.
[03:25:36.285 --> 03:25:46.755]   And this is the summary statement and I hope your leaders are sitting down Holding themselves because what I'm going to tell you intuitively sounds ridiculous.
[03:25:47.596 --> 03:25:51.299]  That's why it's so incredibly important that I say this.
[03:25:53.001 --> 03:26:06.413]  These numbers are best estimates at this point in time using government data for the global consequences of the club shot in terms of death.
[03:26:07.262 --> 03:26:14.885]  and morbidity, otherwise known as serious adverse events such as heart attack, strokes, pulmonary emboli, etc.
[03:26:16.326 --> 03:26:21.548]  We've been focusing for good reason on North American statistics during the last two and a half years.
[03:26:22.608 --> 03:26:31.772]  But this man has extrapolated that into the total effect, negative effect, of the clock chart.
[03:26:31.892 --> 03:26:33.873]  And these are the numbers.
[03:26:36.721 --> 03:26:37.121]  Deaths.
[03:26:37.861 --> 03:26:38.982]  Global deaths.
[03:26:40.322 --> 03:26:44.384]  Directly attributable to the vaccine.
[03:26:44.404 --> 03:26:45.924]  20 million.
[03:26:45.944 --> 03:26:47.745]  2-0-million.
[03:26:48.865 --> 03:26:49.305]  Deaths.
[03:26:51.266 --> 03:26:53.727]  Due to the clot shot.
[03:26:55.647 --> 03:26:57.168]  And 2 billion.
[03:26:57.708 --> 03:26:58.308]  Big B.
[03:26:59.148 --> 03:27:03.970]  2 billion serious adverse reactions of the type I described.
[03:27:05.751 --> 03:27:08.092]  Now, these numbers are beyond staggering.
[03:27:10.572 --> 03:27:25.877]  They, to contrast that with history, vaccines have typically been pulled from the market when the last one, the birth of the vaccine, was pulled with only 35, 3-5 deaths.
[03:27:28.318 --> 03:27:32.719]  I hope people can appreciate the scale of what is going on here.
[03:27:37.716 --> 03:27:40.898]  Ladies and gentlemen, what you just saw is literally the tip of the iceberg.
