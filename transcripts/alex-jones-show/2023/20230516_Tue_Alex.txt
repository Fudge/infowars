[00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:01.290]  FBI report?
[00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.352]  Didn't need to read it to know the truth, already knew it.
[00:00:03.872 --> 00:00:07.916]  No Russian meddling, no one they targeted was connected to Russians in any way.
[00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:10.498]  They were all red-blooded Americans.
[00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:11.379]  Here's Jake Tapper.
[00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:17.284]  Regardless, the report is now here, it has dropped, and it might not have produced everything of what some Republicans hoped for.
[00:00:17.304 --> 00:00:24.370]  It is, regardless, devastating to the FBI, and to a degree, it does exonerate Donald Trump.
[00:00:29.293 --> 00:00:34.257]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:34.277 --> 00:00:54.913]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:56.054]  InfoWars.
[00:00:56.374 --> 00:00:57.896]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:11.740]  I don't mean to brag, I don't care, but I want you to know, double vaxxed, booster, flu shot, and I'm gonna be honest, I have the shingle shot too.
[00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:15.222]  And I still get my period.
[00:01:15.302 --> 00:01:15.782]  What?
[00:01:16.023 --> 00:01:16.363]  Yes!
[00:01:19.463 --> 00:01:27.369]  Traveled, went to Mexico twice, did shows, meet and greets, never got COVID.
[00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:30.331]  Clearly, Jesus loves me the most.
[00:01:30.732 --> 00:01:31.352]  Seriously.
[00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:33.634]  So nice.
[00:01:33.634 --> 00:01:35.634]  So nice!
[00:01:35.634 --> 00:01:37.634]  Ah!
[00:01:37.634 --> 00:01:39.634]  [laughter]
[00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:41.634]  [laughter]
[00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:43.634]  Um, so I'm in the emergency room.
[00:01:43.634 --> 00:01:45.313]  emergency room.
[00:01:45.343 --> 00:01:45.984]  I look weird.
[00:01:47.185 --> 00:01:48.986]  I'm so, so, so, so sorry.
[00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:51.466]  I passed out on stage.
[00:01:51.546 --> 00:01:54.247]  I got up, I did one joke, and I felt so dizzy.
[00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:56.168]  You can see my eye.
[00:01:56.188 --> 00:01:58.008]  I fell on my eye.
[00:01:58.028 --> 00:02:01.209]  Oh, my God.
[00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.050]  I cannot believe this happened.
[00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.351]  I feel so terrible that they had to tell everyone to leave and then cancel the second show.
[00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:11.052]  Tempe, I will be back.
[00:02:13.092 --> 00:02:15.092]  I've never ever fainted in my life.
[00:02:15.092 --> 00:02:29.092]  [Gunfire]
[00:02:29.092 --> 00:02:31.092]  Mandate.
[00:02:30.473 --> 00:02:30.973]  Yes, Jack?
[00:02:32.714 --> 00:02:34.974]  Have you ever seen a commie drink a glass of water?
[00:02:36.414 --> 00:02:40.835]  Well, no, I... I can't say I have, Jack.
[00:02:42.135 --> 00:02:42.655]  Vodka.
[00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:44.516]  That's what they drink, isn't it?
[00:02:45.476 --> 00:02:46.036]  Never water?
[00:02:47.156 --> 00:02:50.617]  Well, I... I believe that's what they drink, Jack, yes.
[00:02:51.697 --> 00:02:54.418]  On no account will a commie ever drink water.
[00:02:55.138 --> 00:02:56.478]  And not without good reason.
[00:02:58.576 --> 00:03:00.557]  Oh, uh, yes.
[00:03:01.377 --> 00:03:06.499]  I, um, can't quite see what you're getting at, Jack.
[00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.959]  Water.
[00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:09.780]  That's what I'm getting at.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.160]  Water.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.961]  Mandrake, water is the source of all life.
[00:03:17.282 --> 00:03:19.263]  Seven-tenths of this Earth's surface is water.
[00:03:20.823 --> 00:03:24.624]  Why do you realize that 70% of you is water?
[00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:28.415]  Oh, God.
[00:03:28.895 --> 00:03:36.077]  And as human beings, you and I need fresh, pure water to replenish our precious bodily fluids.
[00:03:36.137 --> 00:03:36.297]  Yes.
[00:03:37.657 --> 00:03:38.997]  Are you beginning to understand?
[00:03:39.337 --> 00:03:39.537]  Yes.
[00:03:44.058 --> 00:03:44.458]  Mandrake.
[00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:52.539]  Mandrake, have you never wondered why I drink only distilled water?
[00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.980]  Or rainwater?
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.100]  And only pure grain alcohol?
[00:03:57.642 --> 00:04:00.064]  Well, it did occur to me, Jack, yes.
[00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:04.207]  Have you ever heard of a thing called fluoridation?
[00:04:04.227 --> 00:04:05.608]  Fluoridation of water?
[00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.791]  Uh, yes, I have heard of that, Jack, yes.
[00:04:10.492 --> 00:04:10.832]  Yes.
[00:04:11.112 --> 00:04:12.053]  Well, do you know what it is?
[00:04:12.073 --> 00:04:12.113]  No.
[00:04:12.874 --> 00:04:15.936]  No, I don't know what it is now.
[00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:25.365]   Do you realize that fluoridation is the most monstrously conceived and dangerous communist plot we have ever had to
[00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:25.936]  face?
[00:04:25.936 --> 00:04:28.936]  [Gunshots]
[00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:34.936]  [Gunshots]
[00:04:34.936 --> 00:04:35.936]  [Static]
[00:04:35.936 --> 00:04:57.936]   So, it's a tragic role that they are playing because of the tremendous pain.
[00:04:57.936 --> 00:05:07.936]  [Music]
[00:05:08.751 --> 00:05:11.233]  It's Tuesday, May 16, 2023.
[00:05:11.293 --> 00:05:17.216]  I'm in the chair in Austin, Texas, ready to launch an incredibly powerful transmission.
[00:05:17.836 --> 00:05:21.178]  The New World Order is out in the open, and man is it tyrannical.
[00:05:21.718 --> 00:05:24.259]  But humanity is waking up fast.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.521]  And that's what matters.
[00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:28.342]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:05:28.362 --> 00:05:29.522]  Tell everybody you know, tune in.
[00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:32.384]  That's how you Paul Revere their New World Order asses.
[00:05:33.004 --> 00:05:33.544]  Stay with us.
[00:05:33.584 --> 00:05:36.306]  Main transmission launches in T-minus 60 seconds.
[00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:39.312]  We're live, Tuesday, May 16th.
[00:05:39.932 --> 00:05:45.314]  Regardless, the report is now here, it has dropped, and it might not have produced everything of what some Republicans voted for.
[00:05:45.334 --> 00:05:52.457]  It is, regardless, devastating to the FBI, and to a degree, it does exonerate Donald Trump.
[00:05:52.678 --> 00:05:54.278]  Trump, Putin, Russian collusion.
[00:05:54.318 --> 00:05:55.799]  Trump, Russian sort of collusion.
[00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:57.420]  Trump, Russian possible collusion.
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.140]  Trump, Russian metal collusion.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.621]  Trump, Russian possible collusion.
[00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:02.482]  Trump.
[00:06:02.642 --> 00:06:02.982]  Russia.
[00:06:03.102 --> 00:06:03.823]  Possible collusion.
[00:06:03.883 --> 00:06:04.083]  Trump.
[00:06:04.243 --> 00:06:04.623]  Russia.
[00:06:04.683 --> 00:06:05.384]  Possible collusion.
[00:06:05.424 --> 00:06:05.624]  Trump.
[00:06:05.864 --> 00:06:06.224]  Russia.
[00:06:06.284 --> 00:06:06.985]  Possible collusion.
[00:06:07.045 --> 00:06:07.265]  Trump.
[00:06:07.445 --> 00:06:07.785]  Russia.
[00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:08.585]  Possible collusion.
[00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:08.826]  Trump.
[00:06:09.006 --> 00:06:09.366]  Russia.
[00:06:09.406 --> 00:06:10.206]  Possible collusion.
[00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:11.747]  Russia hacked our election.
[00:06:11.787 --> 00:06:13.368]  Here comes a big change.
[00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:15.209]  Because all of a sudden, Trump.
[00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:15.389]  Russia.
[00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:16.210]  Possible collusion.
[00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.950]  Russia.
[00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:17.130]  Russia.
[00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.791]  Possible collusion.
[00:06:18.191 --> 00:06:18.571]  Trump.
[00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:18.871]  Russia.
[00:06:19.012 --> 00:06:20.552]  Possible collusion.
[00:06:20.773 --> 00:06:21.753]  Trump.
[00:06:21.793 --> 00:06:22.113]  Russia.
[00:06:22.153 --> 00:06:22.934]  Possible collusion.
[00:06:22.974 --> 00:06:23.354]  Trump.
[00:06:23.394 --> 00:06:23.734]  Russia.
[00:06:23.954 --> 00:06:24.655]  Possible collusion.
[00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:30.452]  Prove collusion.
[00:06:30.952 --> 00:06:34.053]  Prove collusion.
[00:06:34.173 --> 00:06:35.074]  Was there collusion?
[00:06:35.354 --> 00:06:35.914]  Absolutely.
[00:06:35.994 --> 00:06:37.555]  Trump.
[00:06:37.655 --> 00:06:37.955]  Russia.
[00:06:38.015 --> 00:06:38.756]  Possible collusion.
[00:06:38.996 --> 00:06:39.156]  Trump.
[00:06:39.236 --> 00:06:39.556]  Russia.
[00:06:39.616 --> 00:06:40.336]  Possible collusion.
[00:06:40.376 --> 00:06:40.556]  Trump.
[00:06:40.797 --> 00:06:41.157]  Russia.
[00:06:41.217 --> 00:06:41.957]  Possible collusion.
[00:06:42.157 --> 00:06:42.377]  Trump.
[00:06:42.417 --> 00:06:42.738]  Russia.
[00:06:42.818 --> 00:06:43.538]  Possible collusion.
[00:06:43.598 --> 00:06:43.878]  Trump.
[00:06:43.998 --> 00:06:44.318]  Russia.
[00:06:44.358 --> 00:06:45.239]  Possible collusion.
[00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:45.579]  Trump.
[00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:45.919]  Russia.
[00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:46.759]  Possible collusion.
[00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:47.000]  Trump.
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.560]  Russia.
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.560]  Potential collusion.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.800]  Trump.
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.121]  Russia.
[00:06:49.141 --> 00:06:49.961]  Potential collusion.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.500]   and the Kremlin and be in collusion with Putin and the Kremlin and be in collusion with Putin
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:02.500]   and the Kremlin and be in collusion with Putin and the Kremlin and be in collusion
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.000]   This president, this president and collusion with Putin
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   and the Kremlin and be in collusion This president, this president
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   and collusion with Putin and the Kremlin and be in collusion
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.010]   All 17 intelligence agencies 17 agencies.
[00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.512]  17 of our intelligence agencies have been burned.
[00:07:22.532 --> 00:07:24.113]  17 of our intelligence agencies.
[00:07:24.133 --> 00:07:25.394]  17 intelligence agencies.
[00:07:25.414 --> 00:07:27.996]  17 different United States intelligence agencies.
[00:07:28.016 --> 00:07:28.496]  All 17 of them.
[00:07:28.896 --> 00:07:36.814]   Stand up against the poison of white supremacy as I did my inaugural address to a single
[00:07:36.814 --> 00:07:50.615]   out as the most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland is white supremacy.
[00:07:50.615 --> 00:07:53.696]  I'm not saying this because I'm a black HBCU.
[00:07:53.696 --> 00:07:56.715]   I I say it wherever I go.
[00:07:59.336 --> 00:08:05.419]  So, four years later, the Durham Report doesn't call for any criminal charges other than the couple that got charged for falsifying documents.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.523]  They've already been charged, he says, the whole thing was made up by the Justice Department, by the Democrats and the CIA.
[00:08:14.423 --> 00:08:15.144]  We already knew that.
[00:08:15.424 --> 00:08:17.125]  Believe me, I knew I wasn't a Russian agent.
[00:08:18.092 --> 00:08:19.773]  I knew Trump wasn't a Russian agent.
[00:08:19.853 --> 00:08:21.514]  I knew Roger Stone wasn't a Russian agent.
[00:08:21.814 --> 00:08:23.454]  I knew General Flynn wasn't a Russian agent.
[00:08:23.775 --> 00:08:25.555]  I knew Trump didn't have women peeing on him.
[00:08:26.936 --> 00:08:35.360]  But for the last seven years, even before Trump got elected, they were saying he was a Russian agent.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.922]  And they had the FBI investigate me and put us through hell.
[00:08:41.702 --> 00:08:43.523]  Way worse than anything McCarthy ever did.
[00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:47.325]  So why at the end of those clips did I just play Biden?
[00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.616]  Saying that the number one threat is white supremism.
[00:08:56.559 --> 00:09:10.624]   Well, for the last seven years, at least six months before the election ended, 2016, that's seven years, all we've heard Is that the number one threat is the Russians.
[00:09:10.644 --> 00:09:14.385]  They've taken over our elections when it was the deep state stealing the elections and the deep state surveillance.
[00:09:15.246 --> 00:09:19.867]  So now they've shifted completely to the white supremacist are everywhere.
[00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:21.188]  They're under the table.
[00:09:21.228 --> 00:09:22.649]  They're in your closet.
[00:09:22.669 --> 00:09:23.469]  They're under your bed.
[00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:24.429]  They're looking through your window.
[00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:29.271]  And you've got the patriot front group that's obviously feds running around.
[00:09:30.572 --> 00:09:33.533]  Right after Biden comes out with his message.
[00:09:35.234 --> 00:09:35.974]  So it's a big deal.
[00:09:38.243 --> 00:09:38.944]  It's a huge deal.
[00:09:39.084 --> 00:09:43.587]  And so the new thing... Oh, we got a real war with the Russians now, though.
[00:09:43.607 --> 00:09:44.468]  Don't worry, they started that.
[00:09:44.848 --> 00:09:47.390]  But the new thing is white supremacists.
[00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.153]  And everyone's guilty of secretly being a white supremacist.
[00:09:51.573 --> 00:10:03.142]  If you want lower taxes, if you don't want open borders, if you don't want critical race theory, if you don't want transgenderism, if you don't want lockdowns, forced injections, that's all listed as white supremacism in the report from June of 2021 that Biden put out.
[00:10:04.384 --> 00:10:14.552]  Over and over again, branding Americans that are loyal and good and care about freedom, including triple the number of blacks voting for Trump, double the number of Hispanics.
[00:10:14.752 --> 00:10:15.913]  You're all white supremacist too.
[00:10:15.953 --> 00:10:18.815]  And now we've seen The View and CNN and all of them.
[00:10:19.195 --> 00:10:21.437]  Oh, you don't have to be white to be a white supremacist.
[00:10:21.677 --> 00:10:22.798]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:10:23.158 --> 00:10:25.900]  You're a white supremacist if you don't want to be a slave.
[00:10:28.305 --> 00:10:31.847]  What they're really doing is attacking America and capitalism and freedom and branding.
[00:10:31.927 --> 00:10:32.387]  It is bad.
[00:10:32.668 --> 00:10:36.590]  Trump said years ago after Charlottesville, next they'll want the American flag, not just the rebel flag.
[00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.051]  And now they want the American flag.
[00:10:38.891 --> 00:10:43.174]  They want to undermine the country that enshrines your rights.
[00:10:43.214 --> 00:10:48.177]  Doesn't give you your rights, but it enshrines them, points them out and says, we will protect them.
[00:10:48.837 --> 00:10:49.538]  What's a shrine?
[00:10:50.796 --> 00:10:55.297]  Well, where Jesus was crucified as a shrine, or where George Washington's buried as a shrine.
[00:10:55.317 --> 00:10:56.397]  It's something you protect.
[00:10:56.817 --> 00:10:57.718]  It's something you remember.
[00:10:57.778 --> 00:10:59.378]  It's grandma's grave as a shrine.
[00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:01.439]  It's what a gravestone is, the flowers you put.
[00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:03.539]  Their tomb is a shrine.
[00:11:04.339 --> 00:11:05.179]  A symbol of respect.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.560]  The animals won't eat your dead body.
[00:11:07.379 --> 00:11:10.818]  That's where that comes from.
[00:11:10.818 --> 00:11:18.539]   They've even got studies now that some species of monkeys, got some photos of this
[00:11:18.539 --> 00:11:22.019]  coming up, try to bury.
[00:11:21.613 --> 00:11:24.214]  In particular, they're young when they die because they don't want to see them be eaten.
[00:11:24.894 --> 00:11:25.574]  It's respect.
[00:11:26.294 --> 00:11:27.154]  Even monkeys have it.
[00:11:27.995 --> 00:11:29.115]  Do we respect our unborn?
[00:11:29.535 --> 00:11:30.195]  We chop them up?
[00:11:30.955 --> 00:11:33.336]  So again, here's Biden announcing the new hoax.
[00:11:34.036 --> 00:11:34.856]  Russia, here it is.
[00:11:35.256 --> 00:11:36.497]  But not Russia, racism.
[00:11:38.257 --> 00:11:46.099]  White supremacy, as I did in my inaugural address to a single out as the most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland, is white supremacy.
[00:11:48.484 --> 00:11:50.325]  No, you and the New World Order are the most dangerous threats.
[00:11:50.385 --> 00:11:54.788]  Turning our energy off, race warring us, shipping fentanyl in, human trafficking, turning war on Russia.
[00:11:54.808 --> 00:11:58.211]  And I'm not saying this because I'm a black HBCU.
[00:11:59.632 --> 00:12:01.173]  I say wherever I go.
[00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:04.275]  And if you don't vote for me, you ain't black.
[00:12:05.856 --> 00:12:21.446]   From a guy when he first got elected until about half of his career, 25 years ago, he's been in government for 50 years, longer, was aligning himself With the old South Democrats who were KKK grand wizards and dragons.
[00:12:22.306 --> 00:12:23.466]  I mean, you can't make that up.
[00:12:23.486 --> 00:12:30.308]  It's like, George Soros worked for Hitler, said it was the best time of his life, he loved it, he doesn't apologize, ADL gives him awards.
[00:12:31.108 --> 00:12:34.608]  Robert Byrd, KKK leader, Joe Biden loves him.
[00:12:35.429 --> 00:12:39.029]  It's just, it's just, it gives you a headache is what it does.
[00:12:39.789 --> 00:12:43.030]  These people are the opposite of what they say they are.
[00:12:44.585 --> 00:12:46.667]  They are the opposite of what they say they are.
[00:12:47.507 --> 00:12:49.349]  My grandfather got back from World War II.
[00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.571]  His whole family were Democrats.
[00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:53.332]  Someone wouldn't talk to him for years.
[00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:57.656]  He ran for office on the Eisenhower ticket.
[00:12:58.116 --> 00:13:03.120]  Got elected locally in the late 1950s to government in East Texas.
[00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:04.882]  They loved him forever.
[00:13:04.902 --> 00:13:06.343]  He was a county tax assessor.
[00:13:07.884 --> 00:13:09.345]  Poor people didn't pay taxes under him.
[00:13:10.006 --> 00:13:10.646]  Rich people did.
[00:13:11.667 --> 00:13:12.248]  Jerry Jones.
[00:13:13.322 --> 00:13:19.843]  But the point is, is that he was a Republican because he didn't believe in black people not having rights.
[00:13:21.044 --> 00:13:29.646]  And people don't even know that it's the Republicans from Abraham Lincoln to Eisenhower to Jerry Jones that stood up for black people.
[00:13:29.886 --> 00:13:35.167]  And now we get to sit here and literally hear all day long.
[00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.351]  From the Deep State Democrats that we're bad.
[00:13:39.711 --> 00:13:40.251]  BS!
[00:13:40.331 --> 00:13:40.891]  You're bad!
[00:13:41.091 --> 00:13:42.432]  And I'm sick of your crap!
[00:13:43.112 --> 00:13:44.233]  And I'm sick of your lies!
[00:13:44.513 --> 00:13:45.773]  We're not white supremacists!
[00:13:46.013 --> 00:13:47.134]  And we're not Russian agents!
[00:13:47.334 --> 00:13:49.054]  We're Americans that want freedom!
[00:13:49.635 --> 00:13:50.315]  And security!
[00:13:50.575 --> 00:13:51.375]  And prosperity!
[00:13:51.595 --> 00:13:52.156]  You jerks!
[00:13:54.617 --> 00:13:55.657]  They're the race baiters!
[00:13:55.697 --> 00:13:56.797]  They're the race controllers!
[00:13:56.897 --> 00:13:59.138]  But... I'm gonna get more into Durham later.
[00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:06.301]  I saw some bone-chilling announcements in the New York Times, The Washington Post, Time Magazine over the weekend.
[00:14:07.489 --> 00:14:08.009]  And we called it.
[00:14:08.029 --> 00:14:09.391]  It wasn't hard to call.
[00:14:10.051 --> 00:14:11.012]  In fact, I was surprised.
[00:14:11.052 --> 00:14:13.494]  The fourth, fifth caller we took a couple of weeks ago.
[00:14:13.814 --> 00:14:15.636]  These articles just came out over the weekend.
[00:14:16.276 --> 00:14:18.058]  Two, three weeks ago, we'll find the clip.
[00:14:18.078 --> 00:14:27.145]  I remember the name of the headline for that part of the show was, Learn Why the WHO Ended the COVID Pandemic.
[00:14:27.546 --> 00:14:30.868]  Just go to Band.Video.infoWorks.com.
[00:14:31.529 --> 00:14:32.009]  Type that in.
[00:14:32.029 --> 00:14:32.330]  There it is.
[00:14:33.587 --> 00:14:35.488]  Learn why the WHO ended the COVID crisis.
[00:14:35.508 --> 00:14:37.029]  75,000 views.
[00:14:37.089 --> 00:14:38.610]  It needs 50 billion views.
[00:14:40.051 --> 00:14:42.632]  Everybody needs to watch it 10 times on the planet.
[00:14:43.693 --> 00:14:44.413]  And I called it.
[00:14:45.334 --> 00:14:48.355]  And I asked listeners, I said, what is the proper answer for why they ended it?
[00:14:48.715 --> 00:14:51.177]  Because they're getting the next pandemic ready.
[00:14:51.197 --> 00:14:51.817]  And here it is.
[00:14:52.397 --> 00:14:53.478]  This emergency is over.
[00:14:53.558 --> 00:15:00.102]  Now it's time to get ready for the next pandemic, says the UN, says the United Nations.
[00:15:01.055 --> 00:15:02.376]  Here's the Time Magazine article.
[00:15:02.476 --> 00:15:03.157]  It's everywhere.
[00:15:03.557 --> 00:15:05.378]  It's time to get ready for the next pandemic.
[00:15:05.718 --> 00:15:06.819]  Yeah, folks, we better get ready.
[00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:10.142]  The same people that launched the last one are going to release something even more deadly.
[00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:11.623]  They've already showed their hand.
[00:15:11.643 --> 00:15:13.404]  We'll tell you more about that when we come back.
[00:15:13.984 --> 00:15:16.566]  And we've got Michael Young, investigative journalist.
[00:15:16.586 --> 00:15:17.787]  We've got Roger Stone.
[00:15:18.047 --> 00:15:19.288]  We got it all today.
[00:15:19.348 --> 00:15:21.130]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:15:21.971 --> 00:15:30.177]  How is it possible that they stuck three separate HIV proteins in these shots and effectively gave the world a vaccine-induced AIDS?
[00:15:30.838 --> 00:15:33.980]  If that happened, all the doctors will tell you that is so.
[00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:39.604]  So how is it possible that they've effectively killed half of the globe and they're still walking around free?
[00:15:40.045 --> 00:15:44.068]  Did you know, Todd, the military is starting to test the members of the military for AIDS?
[00:15:44.088 --> 00:15:44.488]  Yes, I do.
[00:15:45.289 --> 00:15:46.710]  Yes, I do know that.
[00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:50.064]  And sickle cell too, by the way.
[00:15:50.304 --> 00:15:56.787]  And sickle cell as well, because the vaccines have also the propensity to change the shape of red blood cells.
[00:15:56.867 --> 00:16:03.230]  And so now they're showing up with sickle cell, with HIV, with cancers that never existed before.
[00:16:04.751 --> 00:16:10.154]  It was only in 2021 that we found there was an 1100% increase in all-cause morbidity and mortality.
[00:16:10.534 --> 00:16:14.276]  We don't know what those numbers are anymore because the DoD changed them and fudged them.
[00:16:14.776 --> 00:16:20.845]  And I was talking to one of our whistleblowers yesterday, funny enough, and I said, well, how can we track how many pilots are no longer flying because they can't?
[00:16:21.466 --> 00:16:25.472]  And this person effectively said, we can't, because now DMED is worthless.
[00:16:25.532 --> 00:16:27.895]  It's not useful because the numbers are all made up.
[00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:29.578]  We don't even know how to track this now.
[00:16:29.969 --> 00:16:45.295]  Now that they're doing these blood tests and they're looking to see if members of the military who have been vaccinated have AIDS, vaccine-acquired immune deficiency, basically, are they also looking to see if, in fact, some of the members of the military even took the vaccine?
[00:16:45.335 --> 00:16:58.865]   Because, let's face it, There's people out there that'll, for a hundred bucks, thousand bucks, whatever, you can walk into a CVS and they'll take your vaccine, squirt it into the trash can and fill out the form and say, well, they came in for their vaccine, didn't tell, I didn't have to tell you, I put it in their arm.
[00:16:59.266 --> 00:17:01.287]  You know, are they going to be able to determine that?
[00:17:02.608 --> 00:17:03.409]  Yeah, they can.
[00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:09.736]  We did mass spectrometry on both Pfizer and Moderna and we found that each of them contains something called luciferase.
[00:17:10.637 --> 00:17:15.222]  In one of them it's SM-102 and in the other one it's ALC-3015 as key ingredients.
[00:17:15.663 --> 00:17:26.389]   Luciferase is a bioluminescent Ingredient, for lack of a better word, that will, in fact, allow third party onlookers to know whether or not you got the shot.
[00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:33.012]  And I've talked to people who showed up at the border with their fake vaccine cards and were turned away because the border inspectors knew they hadn't had the shots.
[00:17:33.372 --> 00:17:34.453]  They knew remotely.
[00:17:34.773 --> 00:17:37.974]  So the answer to your question is yes, they'll know whether people got the shots or not.
[00:17:38.055 --> 00:17:42.176]  And those who stood up and said, I'm not getting the shots are already getting processed out, right?
[00:17:42.677 --> 00:17:45.018]  That's what we're doing from day to day is trying to help those people.
[00:17:47.179 --> 00:17:50.580]  By the way, the scientists and lawyers you were just listening to are not just saying that.
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.641]  Let's put on screen BBC, British Broadcasting Company.
[00:17:56.142 --> 00:18:03.524]  From two years ago, Australia had to stop their COVID vaccine because it was causing false HIV response, saying they had HIV.
[00:18:04.345 --> 00:18:13.728]  And now you can pull up mainstream news, the Army Times, 500% increase in HIV positive in the troops.
[00:18:15.267 --> 00:18:16.588]  And the numbers are always a year behind.
[00:18:16.668 --> 00:18:20.469]  Guess the latest numbers.
[00:18:20.489 --> 00:18:21.190]  2021, 2022, halfway through.
[00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.992]  So, when did the shots start?
[00:18:25.012 --> 00:18:26.913]  2021, January, in the military.
[00:18:27.433 --> 00:18:29.854]  When did the 500% increase begin?
[00:18:29.994 --> 00:18:30.754]  Immediately.
[00:18:30.774 --> 00:18:55.041]   I don't need to be a pathologist, you know, that's coroners, that's people that know the human body and what causes death or what causes illness, to know that if I walk up to you with a semi-automatic 12-gauge shotgun with double-aught buck, And I shoot you in the head and blow the top of your head off, and then I point it at your chest and unload six more cartridges into you, and you're a bloody mess that you're gonna die.
[00:18:55.061 --> 00:19:02.345]  I don't need to be a pathologist that if I take a machete and cut your head off, that you're gonna die!
[00:19:03.866 --> 00:19:05.707]  But I can interview the pathologist all day.
[00:19:05.867 --> 00:19:06.568]  They have the head.
[00:19:07.751 --> 00:19:19.134]  Of the German Pathologist Society, a year and a half ago, come out and say, we're seeing multi-thousand percent increases in cancer and HIV and death from these damn shots.
[00:19:19.414 --> 00:19:23.555]  They had cancer research facilities in Germany again, but also in England and the U.S.
[00:19:24.035 --> 00:19:34.498]  that found that people that had cancer in remission, lymphoma, leukemia, you name it, that it was turning all of their cancers on when they took it.
[00:19:36.934 --> 00:19:38.595]  So again, that's what's happened.
[00:19:38.615 --> 00:19:39.656]  We've already been hit.
[00:19:41.657 --> 00:19:43.398]  There's ways to mitigate the spike protein.
[00:19:43.539 --> 00:19:46.260]  It also spreads to not just those that have taken the shots.
[00:19:47.241 --> 00:19:48.102]  That's in the literature.
[00:19:48.502 --> 00:19:49.423]  That's in the scientific studies.
[00:19:50.003 --> 00:19:51.044]  This is happening.
[00:19:53.085 --> 00:20:10.825]   I don't need to be a pathologist to know that if I walk up to you, or somebody walks up to you with a gallon of gasoline, and they tie you up against a tree, They pour that gallon of gasoline on you, and they line a match and throw it at you, you're gonna burn up.
[00:20:10.905 --> 00:20:11.625]  You're gonna die.
[00:20:11.646 --> 00:20:17.691]  You're gonna have third degree and beyond burns all over your body, and you might not make it to the hospital.
[00:20:17.711 --> 00:20:20.313]  You'll probably die of shock, but regardless, you're gonna die.
[00:20:20.353 --> 00:20:21.074]  You might live a day.
[00:20:21.995 --> 00:20:25.338]  But that gallon of gas is gonna kill you deader than a hammer.
[00:20:28.661 --> 00:20:30.362]  But the pathologists say the shot's killing you.
[00:20:31.323 --> 00:20:31.984]  Not a vaccine.
[00:20:33.410 --> 00:21:12.868]   Now I made a biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii So, what came out a couple days ago in AP, Reuters, Time Magazine, New York Times, Washington Post, this is May 11th.
[00:21:13.368 --> 00:21:15.608]  So what came out a little over a week after I said it?
[00:21:17.049 --> 00:21:18.989]  This emergency is over.
[00:21:19.489 --> 00:21:27.011]  Now it's time to get ready for the next pandemic, says Tedros, the communist who killed over a million of his own people in Ethiopia.
[00:21:30.731 --> 00:21:31.472]  And here's the article.
[00:21:31.872 --> 00:21:33.452]  It's time to get ready for the next pandemic.
[00:21:34.889 --> 00:21:40.152]  The UN says, and Bill Gates says, the next pandemic's imminent, and it's going to target children.
[00:21:40.693 --> 00:21:44.535]  And when it comes out and targets children, they'll be like, they're so smart!
[00:21:44.675 --> 00:21:45.696]  How did you know?
[00:21:45.716 --> 00:21:49.939]  And they got gain-of-function studies going on all over the world.
[00:21:52.793 --> 00:21:53.913]  Go read the article for yourself.
[00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:55.914]  This is just one variant of it.
[00:21:56.414 --> 00:21:56.954]  It's everywhere.
[00:21:57.335 --> 00:21:59.375]  Low-level governments need to sign on to the UN.
[00:21:59.395 --> 00:22:01.236]  We need to follow the UN Treaty.
[00:22:01.476 --> 00:22:03.617]  We need to get ready and do what they say next time.
[00:22:03.877 --> 00:22:05.237]  What did Chelsea Clinton say last week?
[00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:06.598]  We're going to make your kids take it.
[00:22:06.938 --> 00:22:09.099]  We know the kids are going to be hit with the next pandemic.
[00:22:09.379 --> 00:22:14.561]  So they're already telling you your kids are going to get hit with whatever it is they got stewed up in one of their laboratories.
[00:22:17.062 --> 00:22:24.119]   They restarted gain-of-function research at Wuhan, and we're just supposed to sit here Yeah, we got video of Ted Ross.
[00:22:25.059 --> 00:22:26.100]  You want to hear him say all this?
[00:22:27.421 --> 00:22:29.162]  You want to hear that little monster?
[00:22:31.063 --> 00:22:32.304]  I mean, they script it all.
[00:22:32.364 --> 00:22:33.325]  They pre-program it.
[00:22:33.565 --> 00:22:34.185]  They get it ready.
[00:22:35.186 --> 00:22:38.528]  How do I know when Ford's coming out with a new electric car?
[00:22:38.548 --> 00:22:40.109]  Because I see six months of ads for it.
[00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:42.330]  How do I know?
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.701]  When Coca-Cola's coming out with a new flavor, there's six months ads.
[00:22:48.181 --> 00:22:50.622]  How do you know when McDonald's is gonna bring back the McRib?
[00:22:51.122 --> 00:22:52.583]  There's a month of ads for it.
[00:22:52.603 --> 00:22:53.163]  You see billboards?
[00:22:54.183 --> 00:22:56.004]  They tell you what they're gonna do.
[00:22:56.284 --> 00:22:56.744]  Type it in.
[00:22:57.624 --> 00:23:00.845]  UN warns, Bill Gates warns, next pandemic to target children.
[00:23:01.626 --> 00:23:04.827]  And maybe it's next year in the election, maybe it's the year after that, maybe it's next week.
[00:23:05.247 --> 00:23:08.588]  We'll be sitting here, if we're still on air, going, gee, isn't it funny?
[00:23:08.628 --> 00:23:11.509]  He predicted exactly that, and it happened again.
[00:23:12.793 --> 00:23:13.193]  Wow.
[00:23:17.036 --> 00:23:17.296]  Show.
[00:23:17.336 --> 00:23:18.377]  There's that big subject.
[00:23:20.419 --> 00:23:21.459]  Roger Stone's coming up.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.305]  Then we're gonna have open phones the second hour ahead of Michael Yon, incredible investigative journalist on the collapsed border, joining us in the third hour.
[00:23:29.325 --> 00:23:35.630]  You definitely want to look forward to that critical intel, but we know the enemy.
[00:23:36.931 --> 00:23:37.331]  There it is.
[00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:40.173]  Bill Gates' next pandemic to target children.
[00:23:42.375 --> 00:23:43.876]  They love to brag.
[00:23:44.076 --> 00:23:52.961]  It's kind of like a lot of different serial killers, Son of Sam and the Zodiac Killer and others would write letters to the police taunting them saying what they're going to do.
[00:23:53.021 --> 00:23:55.222]  It's the same criminology, same psychology.
[00:23:55.822 --> 00:23:57.423]  They love to tell you what they're going to do.
[00:23:58.904 --> 00:24:06.771]   Roger Stone, Donald Trump, myself and millions of others exonerated FBI report, didn't need to read it to know the truth, already knew it.
[00:24:07.291 --> 00:24:11.353]  No Russian meddling, no one they targeted was connected to Russians in any way.
[00:24:11.673 --> 00:24:13.934]  They were all red-blooded Americans.
[00:24:13.974 --> 00:24:14.814]  Here's Jake Tapper.
[00:24:17.896 --> 00:24:23.278]  Regardless, the report is now here, it has dropped, and it might not have produced everything of what some Republicans hoped for.
[00:24:23.298 --> 00:24:30.382]  It is, regardless, devastating to the FBI, and to a degree it does exonerate Donald Trump.
[00:24:33.177 --> 00:24:36.440]  It's devastating and exonerates Donald Trump, but they're on to the next lie.
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.362]  White supremacists are everywhere.
[00:24:38.922 --> 00:24:41.004]  The statistics don't show that, but it doesn't matter.
[00:24:41.985 --> 00:24:49.171]  Now, going back over six years ago, I would beg Roger when he worked for Infowars, you're a great political analyst.
[00:24:49.251 --> 00:24:50.392]  Nobody thinks you're a Russian agent.
[00:24:50.412 --> 00:24:51.053]  Will you stop it?
[00:24:51.653 --> 00:24:53.055]  He said, listen, this is deadly serious.
[00:24:53.075 --> 00:24:55.216]  They're going to try to impeach Trump, put me in jail, which they did.
[00:24:55.637 --> 00:24:56.518]  Then I took him serious.
[00:24:57.098 --> 00:24:58.259]  But it's not about a victory lap.
[00:24:58.319 --> 00:24:59.620]  It's more like mourning here.
[00:25:00.521 --> 00:25:05.623]  Being sad because they've already geared up new hoaxes, new lies, and no one has been held accountable.
[00:25:05.663 --> 00:25:12.426]  I guess two people got indicted, an FBI agent and somebody else, for lying and falsifying documents, making it look like emails with Russians.
[00:25:12.887 --> 00:25:13.767]  This is insane.
[00:25:14.427 --> 00:25:18.889]  Roger Stone was a staunch and is a staunch anti-communist with Richard Nixon.
[00:25:18.949 --> 00:25:23.431]  Roger Stone's helped run FBI investigations, arresting real communists and real Russians.
[00:25:24.052 --> 00:25:25.372]  And I got investigated.
[00:25:25.412 --> 00:25:26.553]  I watched congressional hearings.
[00:25:27.553 --> 00:25:32.978]  In 2017, House Armed Services Committee and others saying, well an example of a Russian agent is Alex Jones.
[00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:39.844]  And the insult of that, that most people don't have families, because we didn't, most Americans didn't fight a lot of Russians.
[00:25:40.225 --> 00:25:43.448]  I've actually had family that fought Russians in Latin America.
[00:25:44.212 --> 00:25:46.793]  I've actually had family that fought Russians in Africa, okay?
[00:25:47.053 --> 00:25:47.814]  In special operations.
[00:25:48.134 --> 00:25:54.816]  So the idea that my family in the Cold War, especially in the 70s and 80s, literally fought the Russians.
[00:25:54.896 --> 00:25:57.498]  I mean, training spies to go into East Germany.
[00:25:57.838 --> 00:25:58.658]  My family did that.
[00:25:59.018 --> 00:26:00.239]  Very close family members.
[00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:01.439]  As close as you can get.
[00:26:02.239 --> 00:26:05.821]  And I get to sit there and be accused of being a Russian agent.
[00:26:06.081 --> 00:26:07.682]  Who believes that?
[00:26:08.752 --> 00:26:10.893]  Well, I've been screamed at hundreds of times in the street.
[00:26:11.093 --> 00:26:12.654]  I've had tea dumped on my head.
[00:26:12.955 --> 00:26:13.855]  I've had people attack me.
[00:26:13.935 --> 00:26:14.776]  Rogers had it way worse.
[00:26:15.276 --> 00:26:16.697]  And I was talking to Roger last night.
[00:26:16.737 --> 00:26:18.178]  I said, can we sue these people?
[00:26:18.818 --> 00:26:20.739]  And the answer is probably not, because they control the courts.
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.301]  Roger Stone, though, it is a total vindication.
[00:26:23.641 --> 00:26:24.622]  We already knew all this.
[00:26:24.902 --> 00:26:36.986]   But my God, there's got to be some retribution for these criminals that Literally, they manipulated the election, they surveilled, they held back data, they called us all Russians, they used that claim to then use the deep state against us.
[00:26:37.286 --> 00:26:40.467]  This makes what McCarthy did not even register on the Richter scale.
[00:26:40.727 --> 00:26:41.307]  Roger Stone.
[00:26:42.848 --> 00:26:47.209]  Yeah, Alex, unfortunately this is not a satisfying moment.
[00:26:48.102 --> 00:27:02.272]  In other words, we learned from Mr. Durham that which we already knew that the FBI and the Central Intelligence Agency had no basis for which to open the crossfire hurricane investigation.
[00:27:02.633 --> 00:27:04.714]  They had no evidence of Russian collusion.
[00:27:05.054 --> 00:27:14.701]  They had no evidence that Trump was working with the Russians or that I was working with the Russians or that you were working with the Russians.
[00:27:15.181 --> 00:27:29.184]  But what's disappointing is Mr. Durham's conclusion, which is he doesn't recommend the prosecution of any of the people who staged the most outrageous, illegal, dirty trick in American political history.
[00:27:29.864 --> 00:27:39.606]  Not only did they know that there was no evidence against Donald Trump, they also knew that the whole thing was trumped up by Hillary Clinton.
[00:27:40.566 --> 00:27:45.928]  But at the same time, there'll be no prosecution brought against her or her minions.
[00:27:46.308 --> 00:28:00.592]  So, in essence, what Mr. Durham did in the trials that he did bring, is charge the guy driving the getaway car with double parking, while he let the people who robbed the bank get away.
[00:28:00.892 --> 00:28:02.033]  In fact, it's worse than that.
[00:28:02.333 --> 00:28:09.575]  He let the people who robbed the bank testify against the driver who drove the getaway car, but who only got charged with double parking.
[00:28:10.415 --> 00:28:21.002]  You know, tell that to General Flynn, or George Papadopoulos, or Paul Manafort, or Carter Page, or Donald Trump for that matter.
[00:28:21.062 --> 00:28:27.486]  These people tried to destroy our lives, tried to destroy our families, bankrupted us.
[00:28:28.186 --> 00:28:33.730]  Their charges subject us to daily threats of violence, even today.
[00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.511]  And nobody will be held accountable.
[00:28:36.552 --> 00:28:43.656]  This story, sadly, even though it totally exonerates Donald Trump and us, will be in and out of the news in a day.
[00:28:45.182 --> 00:28:45.983]  What are you going to say?
[00:28:46.163 --> 00:28:48.785]  Because, you know, you get mostly love what we were talking last night.
[00:28:48.825 --> 00:28:51.607]  You still get screamed at the grocery store, restaurants, you're arresting agents.
[00:28:51.967 --> 00:28:53.488]  It happens to me occasionally still.
[00:28:54.089 --> 00:28:55.530]  I mean, what do you say to these idiots?
[00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:59.873]  I mean, they have hundreds of Hollywood movies and TV shows about McCarthy and how bad he was.
[00:29:00.674 --> 00:29:03.636]  He did violate some constitutional rights, but mainly he was going after real communists.
[00:29:04.196 --> 00:29:05.257]  This guy meant well.
[00:29:06.738 --> 00:29:08.199]  I mean, and I'm not defending what he did.
[00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:11.722]  Compared to McCarthy, I mean, these people are monsters.
[00:29:12.984 --> 00:29:15.465]  Well, none of this is really surprising to me.
[00:29:15.685 --> 00:29:47.604]   On election day, November 3rd, 2020, the busiest news day of the entire year, by court order, at midnight, if you want to bury a story, put out a press release at midnight, at midnight, the Justice Department was forced to release the final, long-hidden, long-redacted sections of Robert Mueller's report in which he finally admitted That he had found, quote, no factual evidence against me pertaining to Russian collusion or Wikileaks collaboration or any other crime.
[00:29:47.965 --> 00:29:49.567]  But the media buried that.
[00:29:49.727 --> 00:29:51.388]  Alex, it was covered on InfoWars.
[00:29:51.769 --> 00:29:57.835]  It was covered, strangely enough, at BuzzFeed, but that's because they brought the lawsuit that uncovered these documents.
[00:29:58.476 --> 00:30:00.238]  It was covered by Zero Hedge.
[00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:03.040]  That story has, strangely enough, been taken down.
[00:30:03.341 --> 00:30:04.322]  Don't ask me why.
[00:30:04.342 --> 00:30:17.854]  But as Ray Donovan, who was Secretary of Labor under Ronald Reagan, who underwent outrageous accusations of being mobbed up, which he was not, where do you go to get your good name back?
[00:30:18.214 --> 00:30:20.416]  Where do you report for that?
[00:30:22.038 --> 00:30:22.799]  What do you think?
[00:30:22.979 --> 00:30:24.841]  I mean, for me, it's the white supremacy trope.
[00:30:26.604 --> 00:30:30.505]  Let's play this Biden clip, but what else is their new hoax?
[00:30:30.545 --> 00:30:36.126]  They've always got the Jan 6th, we're all terrorists, we're all white supremacists, while they have their patriot front feds running around.
[00:30:36.786 --> 00:30:37.846]  What's their new hoax?
[00:30:37.926 --> 00:30:39.527]  Because they always have a new hoax.
[00:30:39.587 --> 00:30:43.907]  In fact, it looks like they're recycling Russia and doubling down saying, no, no, they are all Russian agents.
[00:30:44.268 --> 00:30:47.008]  Maybe that's where the lawsuits start because now they're doubling down.
[00:30:47.448 --> 00:30:48.408]  But here's Biden.
[00:30:49.849 --> 00:30:55.890]  To stand up against the poison of white supremacists, I did my inaugural address through a single out.
[00:30:56.707 --> 00:31:00.533]  As the most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland is white supremacy.
[00:31:01.815 --> 00:31:02.716]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:31:03.237 --> 00:31:04.358]  We already played it twice today.
[00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:07.543]  So, do you think that's still their big new push?
[00:31:08.004 --> 00:31:10.207]  Or are they going to go back like a dog to vomit to Russia?
[00:31:11.577 --> 00:31:12.678]  Very, very clearly.
[00:31:12.758 --> 00:31:17.280]  One of the funniest things I watched last night was Ken Delanian of NBC.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.381]  Now, Delanian is a long-time CIA show.
[00:31:20.761 --> 00:31:26.724]  He was actually fired by the Chicago Tribune Company for clearing his stories at Langley.
[00:31:27.044 --> 00:31:29.005]  He's an apologist for the deep state.
[00:31:29.745 --> 00:31:37.849]  His default was, oh no, the Mueller report and the Senate Intelligence Committee report proved that there was Russian collusion.
[00:31:38.349 --> 00:31:49.498]  The Senate Intelligence Committee report is the single worst pasted together collection of lies that are reported in the fake news media that is passed off by truth.
[00:31:49.718 --> 00:31:51.640]  Oh, it was bipartisan, he says.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:58.925]  No, every single reference to me in the Senate Intelligence Committee report is completely and totally false.
[00:31:59.045 --> 00:32:04.168]   But that's the thing about the The Democrat fake media cabal.
[00:32:04.568 --> 00:32:12.391]  It doesn't matter how discredited or how debunked or how disproven their narrative is.
[00:32:12.751 --> 00:32:18.673]  If you just wait three weeks, they will cycle right back around to it as if nothing has changed.
[00:32:19.034 --> 00:32:20.094]  So you're right, Alex.
[00:32:20.114 --> 00:32:30.978]  We're right back to, but oh, but there, but Mueller did prove Trump was in touch with Russia and Manafort was giving polling numbers to this guy, Kalemnik, which that's not true.
[00:32:30.798 --> 00:32:35.596]   true either. But the latest spin, the latest spin by their operatives, I'm sure you've seen it all
[00:32:35.596 --> 00:32:40.317]   over the news and Twitter, is that well there were people convicted by Mueller but not one had a
[00:32:40.317 --> 00:32:46.798]   connection to anything with Russia. Yeah that is true and therefore thousands of people today,
[00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:53.517]   literally thousands, on social media, on email, on text messages urging me to sue.
[00:32:53.762 --> 00:33:00.665]  But unfortunately, while my lawyers will look very hard at that, first of all, you'd have to have a substantial war chest to sue.
[00:33:01.065 --> 00:33:01.425]  I don't.
[00:33:02.005 --> 00:33:05.727]  But secondarily, I wasn't convicted of Russian collusion.
[00:33:06.027 --> 00:33:10.349]  I was convicted of lying about things that never even happened.
[00:33:11.649 --> 00:33:17.554]  The very narrow nature of the charges against me, which were extraordinarily clever.
[00:33:17.574 --> 00:33:26.781]  You have to remember, the judge ruled at the very beginning of my trial, the government did not have to prove Russian collusion in order to convict me of obstruction.
[00:33:26.801 --> 00:33:29.483]  All right, Roger, let's talk about what comes next with this deep state.
[00:33:29.803 --> 00:33:30.784]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[00:33:31.885 --> 00:33:35.928]  Well, you can say what you want about Donald Trump or Roger Stone.
[00:33:37.349 --> 00:33:38.250]  These men don't give up.
[00:33:40.206 --> 00:33:41.487]  And they got the eye of the tiger.
[00:33:42.167 --> 00:33:47.170]  And let me tell you, I have not seen Trump give people real smiles.
[00:33:48.391 --> 00:33:54.274]  One time when I met him at the RNC briefly, 2016, he gave me a big Cheshire Cat smile.
[00:33:54.755 --> 00:33:55.835]  That's very rare.
[00:33:55.855 --> 00:34:01.199]  And I knew I'd never seen him actually smile like that, but he did it for Roger Stone.
[00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:02.679]  And you want to see the real Trump?
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:08.423]  Here's a clip of Trump with a ear to ear smile for Roger Stone just a few days ago.
[00:34:08.968 --> 00:34:12.451]  A friend of mine for a long time, he only likes politics.
[00:34:12.531 --> 00:34:15.313]  If you ask him about how are the Yankees doing, he has no interest.
[00:34:15.393 --> 00:34:21.238]  If you ask him almost anything, he likes politics and he's a professional at the highest level.
[00:34:21.838 --> 00:34:22.799]  Roger Stone.
[00:34:22.798 --> 00:34:24.798]  Where's Roger?
[00:34:24.798 --> 00:34:30.798]  [Applause]
[00:34:30.798 --> 00:34:32.798]  Thank you, Roger.
[00:34:33.305 --> 00:34:38.692]  Well, I'm not in a Trump worship society, but you got one of the rare smiles.
[00:34:38.732 --> 00:34:40.114]  I've only seen that like three or four times.
[00:34:40.534 --> 00:34:44.840]  I got it once in person, but that's the real Trump smile, isn't it?
[00:34:45.936 --> 00:34:46.596]  Yeah, it really is.
[00:34:46.616 --> 00:34:49.258]  It was a really gracious moment by President Trump.
[00:34:49.298 --> 00:34:54.100]  We have been friends and allies for 44 years.
[00:34:55.161 --> 00:35:00.603]  And of course, I went through hell because of him, but I refuse to break.
[00:35:00.663 --> 00:35:01.744]  I refuse to lie.
[00:35:01.764 --> 00:35:04.745]  I refuse to bear false witness against him.
[00:35:04.765 --> 00:35:15.271]   And he in turn, yes, he saw the unjust nature of the prosecution against me, the outrageousness of the Soviet-style show trial that was run against me.
[00:35:16.011 --> 00:35:18.113]  And therefore, yes, I owe him my life.
[00:35:18.213 --> 00:35:24.597]  But no, there was no quid pro quo because, as you know, Alex, there was nothing to lie about.
[00:35:24.797 --> 00:35:26.618]  There was no Russian collusion.
[00:35:26.898 --> 00:35:29.260]  There was no WikiLeaks collaboration.
[00:35:30.051 --> 00:35:32.453]  Well, I know Trump not as well as you, but I know him well.
[00:35:32.473 --> 00:35:34.875]  Look at that photo we just showed with you and your wife.
[00:35:34.935 --> 00:35:35.555]  It's a fake smile.
[00:35:35.575 --> 00:35:36.616]  He does them all day for cameras.
[00:35:36.636 --> 00:35:38.978]  But right here at the end, you got a real Trump smile.
[00:35:39.058 --> 00:35:40.839]  So, obviously, he endears you.
[00:35:40.879 --> 00:35:42.100]  He knows you didn't sell him out.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.962]  And you see, you got the real Trump smile right there.
[00:35:45.302 --> 00:35:46.423]  That's a real rarity right there.
[00:35:46.663 --> 00:35:48.104]  I think you should do that more, don't you, Roger?
[00:35:48.345 --> 00:35:49.005]  I'm the same way, though.
[00:35:49.025 --> 00:35:49.886]  I don't smile a lot.
[00:35:49.906 --> 00:35:53.508]  I only smile when it's 100% real and I can't control it, which I normally control it.
[00:35:53.669 --> 00:35:55.390]  So, you got a real Trump smile there.
[00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:56.050]  I don't care.
[00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.852]  The nice words you said are true and great, but you got that real smile.
[00:35:58.872 --> 00:35:59.393]  That's very rare.
[00:36:01.006 --> 00:36:02.047]  I totally agree.
[00:36:02.347 --> 00:36:04.528]  Like you, I don't have an all-natural smile.
[00:36:04.928 --> 00:36:06.289]  Nixon was like this, by the way.
[00:36:06.329 --> 00:36:08.470]  He didn't have an all-natural smile either.
[00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:12.572]  So when you saw a genuine smile, it was rare, but it was real.
[00:36:13.692 --> 00:36:14.193]  Absolutely.
[00:36:14.233 --> 00:36:15.353]  I know you were close to Nixon.
[00:36:16.134 --> 00:36:18.935]  I know you never tell all the stuff about him, but man, you wrote a book about Nixon.
[00:36:19.495 --> 00:36:20.536]  Quiet the stories.
[00:36:22.254 --> 00:36:37.990]  He was, you know, a treaty of arms limitation agreement with the Soviets, desegregation of the public schools, unilaterally saving Israel from annihilation in the Yom Kippur War of 1973, federal revenue sharing.
[00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.832]  He was a great, great president.
[00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:46.578]  Unfortunately, the left, the hateful left, buries all of that in the ashes of Watergate.
[00:36:47.159 --> 00:36:49.060]  Alright, shifting gears into what I wanted to bring up.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:49.821]  The crew found it.
[00:36:50.181 --> 00:36:51.462]  This got not a lot of attention.
[00:36:51.482 --> 00:36:51.903]  It deserved it.
[00:36:52.023 --> 00:36:54.384]  Major nationwide Rasmussen poll.
[00:36:55.045 --> 00:36:55.785]  Robert F. Kennedy, 35.
[00:36:56.166 --> 00:36:56.566]  Biden, 36.
[00:36:57.026 --> 00:37:00.008]  And the other candidates got 6, 11, and 12.
[00:37:00.969 --> 00:37:04.432]  So, Robert F. Kennedy in a dead heat in a national poll.
[00:37:05.192 --> 00:37:06.293]  This is pretty exciting.
[00:37:07.921 --> 00:37:11.502]  Well, first of all, Rasmussen is a totally credible pollster.
[00:37:11.603 --> 00:37:19.446]  I mean, I have reviewed their methodology, their sample size, the wording of their questions, the order of their questions.
[00:37:20.026 --> 00:37:21.867]  These guys know what they're doing.
[00:37:21.927 --> 00:37:24.848]  They're not making these numbers up in the kitchen sink.
[00:37:25.588 --> 00:37:35.013]  Secondarily, I think these are accurate in the sense that there is no enthusiasm among any Democrats for the re-election of Joe Biden.
[00:37:35.774 --> 00:37:44.979]  What's interesting is that Robert Kennedy is doing as well as he is, given the widespread campaign of censorship that's being waged against him.
[00:37:45.459 --> 00:37:56.749]  Now, if I say too many nice things about Robert Kennedy, you'll see it all over Twitter in ten minutes that Steve Bannon and Roger Stone convinced him to run, and they're running his campaigns.
[00:37:56.809 --> 00:37:59.031]  No, none of that's true.
[00:37:59.051 --> 00:38:01.334]  I wouldn't call him a friend, I'd call him a friend.
[00:38:01.374 --> 00:38:04.857]  No, you just admire the integrity, because we're not just Republicans.
[00:38:04.897 --> 00:38:06.818]  I mean, I'd love to see Democrats have people of integrity.
[00:38:07.099 --> 00:38:11.523]  He's a man of integrity, and he's a man whose dad and uncle were killed, and he's a man that we respect.
[00:38:12.793 --> 00:38:18.917]  Well, and I agree with his national, I should say his international geopolitical outlook.
[00:38:18.937 --> 00:38:24.780]  He understands that the neocons are driving this country to the brink of nuclear war.
[00:38:25.141 --> 00:38:33.185]  He understands that we have been exporting death and destruction while the Chinese have been building roads.
[00:38:33.285 --> 00:38:34.006]  And it goes further.
[00:38:34.326 --> 00:38:38.269]  He says the borders are open to bring in a permanent underclass and enslave us and should be closed.
[00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:38.649]  Boom.
[00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:43.633]  He comes out and says this is about banning the guns, it's about banning the SSRIs that most shooters are on.
[00:38:44.313 --> 00:38:47.556]  You know, he comes out against basically the environmental movement.
[00:38:47.576 --> 00:38:49.057]  He's the biggest real environmentalist out there.
[00:38:49.337 --> 00:38:53.640]  He says the current environmental movement's about a carbon tax global power grab run by BlackRock.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.022]  I mean, he's really hitting on all cylinders.
[00:38:56.523 --> 00:38:56.803]  Wow.
[00:38:56.823 --> 00:38:58.384]  I mean, he really woke up or something.
[00:38:59.474 --> 00:39:06.900]  Yeah, and of course, his extraordinarily courageous position on the safety and effectiveness of vaccinations.
[00:39:07.801 --> 00:39:15.186]  These kind of numbers, however, will have the effect of scaring the daylights out of the professional Democrat machine.
[00:39:15.667 --> 00:39:26.851]   And therefore, I believe, unfortunately, despite the fact that Robert Kennedy seems to be running a very interesting and engaging campaign, I think they're going to kneecap him the way they
[00:39:26.851 --> 00:39:28.211]  did Bernie Sanders.
[00:39:28.211 --> 00:39:34.251]   Meaning I think there'll never be a debate between Joe Biden and any of his
[00:39:34.251 --> 00:39:38.092]  challengers if Biden remains the choice of the machine.
[00:39:38.092 --> 00:39:40.572]  Biden couldn't debate a potted plant.
[00:39:40.572 --> 00:39:48.092]   No, and Robert Kennedy, despite his congenital, you know, speech problem, I
[00:39:48.092 --> 00:39:53.771]   should say degenerative speech problem, is a very, very strong speaker and
[00:39:53.771 --> 00:39:54.652]  communicator.
[00:39:55.151 --> 00:39:59.134]  And he obviously doesn't need cue cards to do it, unlike Joe.
[00:39:59.655 --> 00:40:07.381]  So I suspect that before it's over, they will keep him off the ballot in various states and caucuses, primaries and caucuses.
[00:40:07.421 --> 00:40:12.705]  Yeah, for those who don't know, Bernie won a bunch of states, and Hillary, the delegates were just given to Hillary.
[00:40:12.905 --> 00:40:13.565]  They admitted that.
[00:40:14.646 --> 00:40:22.632]  Yeah, they cheated to nominate her, and of course Bernie wasn't even a Democrat technically a year before he announced for the nomination.
[00:40:22.692 --> 00:40:27.195]  So, Robert Kennedy's doing an extraordinarily good job of getting attention.
[00:40:27.755 --> 00:40:29.757]  ABC News does an interview with him.
[00:40:30.217 --> 00:40:30.457]  Sure.
[00:40:30.477 --> 00:40:31.757]  What about a Trump-Kennedy ticket?
[00:40:31.577 --> 00:40:36.857]   of the interview on the cutting room floor because they decide that he is
[00:40:36.857 --> 00:40:43.217]   quote-unquote spreading misinformation as opposed to letting the people decide
[00:40:43.217 --> 00:40:47.416]   after hearing Kennedy whether they believe him or not. What about a Trump
[00:40:47.416 --> 00:40:53.416]  Kennedy ticket would that not be powerful? It would be.
[00:40:51.896 --> 00:41:02.908]  It's so powerful, in fact, that I noticed Robert Kennedy put out a strong statement a week ago saying that under no circumstances whatsoever would he ever consider being Trump's running mate.
[00:41:03.329 --> 00:41:07.173]  Trump hasn't commented on this, but I don't think he's focused on it either.
[00:41:07.653 --> 00:41:10.997]  But when I first- Well, that's like Newsom saying he's not going to run for president.
[00:41:11.237 --> 00:41:11.898]  We all know he is.
[00:41:12.198 --> 00:41:12.619]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:23.619]  Well, I guess my point is, when I threw this idea out in a Substack piece a couple weeks ago, which I did, I said at the time, today, neither man would even consider this.
[00:41:23.959 --> 00:41:26.721]  Today, Robert Kennedy's running for the Democratic nomination.
[00:41:27.102 --> 00:41:29.323]  Today, Trump is running for the Republican nomination.
[00:41:29.664 --> 00:41:33.267]  This is too far outside the box for them to consider.
[00:41:33.707 --> 00:41:36.248]  But this decision isn't being made today.
[00:41:36.528 --> 00:41:38.209]  It will be made next August.
[00:41:38.269 --> 00:41:46.092]  And by that time, perhaps the idea of a bipartisan national unity ticket will have more appeal.
[00:41:46.792 --> 00:41:53.675]  I think at the end of the democratic process, as much as I like Robert Kennedy, I don't think he's going to get nominated.
[00:41:53.975 --> 00:42:00.436]   And I think there are going to be hundreds of thousands of dis- affected Democrats who are potentially voters for Donald
[00:42:00.436 --> 00:42:01.496]  Trump in the fall.
[00:42:01.496 --> 00:42:06.335]   Once again, for you freaks on Twitter, no, I'm not running Robert Kennedy's campaign.
[00:42:06.335 --> 00:42:08.036]  No, I've met him once in my life.
[00:42:08.036 --> 00:42:13.255]   That picture gets you of he and I and general Flynn gets used over and over.
[00:42:13.255 --> 00:42:16.595]   Sure, but the bottom line is we know they're going to, Sanders was horrible,
[00:42:16.595 --> 00:42:17.455]  but they still stole it from him.
[00:42:17.765 --> 00:42:18.605]  Kennedy's amazing.
[00:42:18.905 --> 00:42:19.626]  They're gonna do it.
[00:42:19.766 --> 00:42:23.088]  And then he would have all those disaffected people to swing him over to Trump.
[00:42:23.389 --> 00:42:25.010]  There's no way they could stand against that.
[00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:26.811]  That is the dream ticket.
[00:42:27.451 --> 00:42:28.832]  I would get behind Trump 100% if he did that.
[00:42:31.154 --> 00:42:33.035]  I have written about this at my Substack.
[00:42:33.216 --> 00:42:34.596]  I continue to talk about it.
[00:42:35.257 --> 00:42:41.380]  I respect Robert Kennedy saying it's not something he's considering, but I also recognize that that is today.
[00:42:41.761 --> 00:42:51.507]  It also would completely solve the problem of those who are concerned about President Trump's position on the COVID-19 vaccination.
[00:42:51.887 --> 00:43:05.376]   President Trump could pledge to appoint a Blue Ribbon Commission With Robert Kennedy as the head to get to the bottom of exactly what happened in the pandemic vis-a-vis COVID-19.
[00:43:06.176 --> 00:43:08.918]  That problem politically would then be solved.
[00:43:08.978 --> 00:43:11.860]  So, I think it's a dream ticket in many, many ways.
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:14.682]  Now, there are a number of legal obstacles to it.
[00:43:19.125 --> 00:43:22.968]  What's going to happen with Biden, who is degenerating even faster than we thought, back in two minutes?
[00:43:23.328 --> 00:43:27.812]  Please don't forget, folks, I've been doing so many shows and so on the air so much, I'm not plugging.

[00:44:03.318 --> 00:44:04.098]  Open phones this hour.
[00:44:04.118 --> 00:44:06.900]  A ton of news, but Roger Stone held over to finish up some points.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:10.682]  He got cut off for the break, getting into national polls for candidates.
[00:44:10.722 --> 00:44:16.965]  I wanted to get your take on what they're going to do with Biden, because he was out of his mind when he got elected, or stole the election two and a half years ago.
[00:44:17.505 --> 00:44:23.428]  Now he doesn't know what planet he's on, and other key tidbits you want to impart, Roger, and how folks find your amazing 5 p.m.
[00:44:23.508 --> 00:44:24.669]  Eastern show every day.
[00:44:26.184 --> 00:44:36.855]  Well, Alex, I thought that the nature of Joe Biden's reelection announcement, doing it video, no events, no announcement tour, no rallies, no fundraising events.
[00:44:37.255 --> 00:44:49.447]  That tells me that that announcement was a holding action, the purpose of which was to freeze the field where it is so that, say, for example, Gavin Newsom does not move forward.
[00:44:50.188 --> 00:45:10.756]   I still believe at the end of the day, it's a measure of how the actual Hunter Biden laptop investigation rolls out, whether or not the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service are shielding him from prosecution, whether he gets prosecuted.
[00:45:11.096 --> 00:45:12.938]  So Democrats have kind of two factors.
[00:45:13.198 --> 00:45:20.204]  One, the growingly uneven, shall we say, performance of Joe Biden in the role of president.
[00:45:20.604 --> 00:45:30.011]  And in public, combined with the encroaching corruption of his entire family, may make him completely and totally un-reelectable.
[00:45:30.391 --> 00:45:40.558]  In which case, I stand by my prediction, made here on InfoWars, that the party will turn to Michelle Obama as their strongest candidate.
[00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:42.179]  I still believe that is true.
[00:45:42.539 --> 00:45:51.183]   The fact that they've changed the Democratic Party lineup, To essentially do away with their historic Iowa caucuses, do away with the New Hampshire primary.
[00:45:51.683 --> 00:45:58.846]  Their process jump starts in South Carolina, where African American voters dominate the Democratic primary.
[00:45:59.606 --> 00:46:02.667]  Michelle Obama considers that her native state.
[00:46:03.007 --> 00:46:04.848]  The convention is going to be in Chicago.
[00:46:05.228 --> 00:46:08.129]  She could raise a couple hundred million dollars in just weeks.
[00:46:08.589 --> 00:46:11.030]  I still believe that she will be their candidate.
[00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:14.411]  I also believe she will be their strongest candidate.
[00:46:16.906 --> 00:46:19.147]  Roger, what other wild cards are out there?
[00:46:21.308 --> 00:46:24.009]  Well, you know, it remains to be seen.
[00:46:24.089 --> 00:46:28.010]  I did this Reawaken America tour event this weekend in Doral.
[00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:28.730]  It was great.
[00:46:29.751 --> 00:46:33.572]  But I have never seen the kind of ferocious attacks.
[00:46:33.892 --> 00:46:36.073]  You mentioned this at the top of the hour.
[00:46:36.973 --> 00:46:42.619]  White supremacists, anti-semites, Nazis, bigots, racists.
[00:46:43.019 --> 00:46:44.581]  No, we are none of those things.
[00:46:44.601 --> 00:46:52.109]  In fact, we specifically denounce those ideologies or those tropes or those repugnant ideas.
[00:46:52.729 --> 00:46:54.111]  But that's what they're down to.
[00:46:54.371 --> 00:46:59.376]  They're really down to the politics of insult and the politics of destruction.
[00:47:00.056 --> 00:47:10.766]  They would have us believe that they think that any child should be aborted right up to the moment of delivery, but we're the extremists, for example.
[00:47:13.249 --> 00:47:15.050]  Well, Roger, what we know is this.
[00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:21.776]  We are living in an incredibly exciting time right now, and this election coming up is going to be insane.
[00:47:22.277 --> 00:47:23.198]  Absolutely insane.
[00:47:25.066 --> 00:47:32.768]  It's the last best hope for man, is the last best hope for this country, indeed for Western civilization.
[00:47:32.788 --> 00:47:34.768]  That's why I'm all in for Donald Trump.
[00:47:35.108 --> 00:47:35.728]  Is he perfect?
[00:47:35.808 --> 00:47:36.848]  No, he's not perfect.
[00:47:37.569 --> 00:47:39.729]  Is he head and shoulders above anyone else?
[00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.369]  Yes.
[00:47:40.529 --> 00:47:44.070]  And I really believe he got an education in his first term.
[00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:49.171]  I think he'd be a very different, in fact, better president in his second term.
[00:47:49.211 --> 00:47:49.811]  And I do think.
[00:47:50.391 --> 00:47:54.512]  Because I believe in the Kim Clement prophecy, he will get that second term.
[00:47:54.932 --> 00:47:56.833]  So Alex, thanks for having me today.
[00:47:56.853 --> 00:48:08.636]  I did want to celebrate exoneration for both Donald Trump and myself and remind folks that you can see me every day at five o'clock Eastern at stonezone.live.
[00:48:08.676 --> 00:48:09.836]  Stonezone.live.
[00:48:10.256 --> 00:48:11.096]  Tune in today.
[00:48:11.116 --> 00:48:13.877]  I have Dr. Kirk Elliott talking about the economy.
[00:48:13.917 --> 00:48:17.598]  And of course, we're going to break down the impact of the Durham report.
[00:48:18.119 --> 00:48:19.261]  All right, Roger Stone.
[00:48:19.702 --> 00:48:20.683]  Godspeed, my friend.
[00:48:21.623 --> 00:48:22.623]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:48:22.623 --> 00:48:23.623]  All right.
[00:48:23.623 --> 00:48:27.023]   We're going to take your calls in this hour, but I want to come back with a clip of Joe
[00:48:27.023 --> 00:48:31.103]   Rogan yesterday talking about the Patriot front, what obvious feds they are.
[00:48:31.103 --> 00:48:32.103]  Oh, my gosh, folks.
[00:48:32.103 --> 00:48:35.903]   There's new footage of them attacking a camera guy who identified who they were.
[00:48:35.903 --> 00:48:39.222]   These guys are 100 percent working for the Southern Poverty Law Center or the ADL.
[00:48:39.222 --> 00:48:40.461]  We're going to play that clip.
[00:48:40.461 --> 00:48:42.903]   We come back, give the toll-free number out and take your calls.
[00:48:42.903 --> 00:48:44.583]  In fact, I'm giving the number out now.
[00:48:44.583 --> 00:48:45.583]  877-789-2539.
[00:48:45.583 --> 00:48:46.583]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:48:46.583 --> 00:48:47.583]  First-time callers.
[00:48:47.583 --> 00:48:48.583]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:48.583 --> 00:49:09.222]  Infowars is known for being tomorrow's news today.
[00:49:09.256 --> 00:49:13.377]  InfoWars is known for having 98% accuracy on average.
[00:49:14.057 --> 00:49:18.539]  InfoWars is known as being a game-changer, and our products are not any different.
[00:49:19.159 --> 00:49:29.982]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try if you've never tried them, or if you've been a regular buyer of them, they've been sold out for a long time, they're back in stock, I want to remind you they're now back in stock, are the Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth.
[00:49:30.302 --> 00:49:35.524]   I don't have time in 60 seconds to tell you about all the ingredients, but believe me, You want to go research.
[00:49:35.544 --> 00:49:41.587]  You want to go check out Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth back in stock.
[00:49:41.647 --> 00:49:42.707]  But they're selling out quick.
[00:49:43.027 --> 00:49:45.429]  And despite the fact they're selling out, they're both discounted.
[00:49:45.709 --> 00:49:48.890]  In fact, Real Red Pill Plus is 40% off right now.
[00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:51.011]  But in a week or so, it's going to go back to full price.
[00:49:51.271 --> 00:49:52.052]  It's about to sell out.
[00:49:52.312 --> 00:49:52.752]  Look at these guys.
[00:49:52.772 --> 00:49:53.633]  Where's the fat people?
[00:49:53.653 --> 00:49:54.914]  How come they're all wearing the same clothes?
[00:49:54.954 --> 00:49:55.554]  Do that again.
[00:49:55.594 --> 00:49:56.195]  What the fuck is this?
[00:49:56.215 --> 00:49:59.077]  Have you ever seen anything that looks more like feds?
[00:49:58.897 --> 00:50:02.937]  or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[00:50:02.937 --> 00:50:04.297]  Thank you for your support.
[00:50:04.297 --> 00:50:08.176]  Look at these guys.
[00:50:08.176 --> 00:50:09.736]  Where's the fat people?
[00:50:09.736 --> 00:50:13.097]  How come they're all wearing the same clothes?
[00:50:13.097 --> 00:50:13.937]  Do that again.
[00:50:13.937 --> 00:50:15.096]  What the fuck is this?
[00:50:15.096 --> 00:50:17.576]   Is that, have you ever seen anything that looks more like feds?
[00:50:17.576 --> 00:50:20.936]  Tell me that doesn't look like feds.
[00:50:21.493 --> 00:50:23.174]  It's like the 101st Airborne or something like that.
[00:50:23.194 --> 00:50:23.774]  Bro, look at this!
[00:50:23.794 --> 00:50:24.934]  These guys are all runners!
[00:50:25.434 --> 00:50:27.055]  These guys look like they just got out of Buds!
[00:50:27.795 --> 00:50:28.835]  I mean, look.
[00:50:28.855 --> 00:50:30.076]  The fuck out of here.
[00:50:30.296 --> 00:50:30.916]  Look at this!
[00:50:31.356 --> 00:50:32.557]  The fuck out of here.
[00:50:32.857 --> 00:50:36.438]  How do they all have, like, uniformed outfits on?
[00:50:36.478 --> 00:50:39.159]  They have the same color pants, for the most part.
[00:50:39.339 --> 00:50:40.519]  Very little variation.
[00:50:40.879 --> 00:50:42.660]  They have tan or brown pants.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.641]  Dark blue shirts with a fucking stupid flag on it.
[00:50:46.841 --> 00:50:48.061]  This asshole's got a drum!
[00:50:48.281 --> 00:50:48.821]  Back that up!
[00:50:49.222 --> 00:50:50.322]  Look at the fucking drum!
[00:50:51.735 --> 00:50:52.876]  Bitch, are you Paul Revere?
[00:50:53.096 --> 00:50:54.797]  What the fuck are you doing with that drum?
[00:50:55.318 --> 00:50:57.740]  He's walking around with a band drum.
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:59.101]  It's a white power drum line.
[00:50:59.421 --> 00:51:01.823]  This is so stupid it hurts my feelings.
[00:51:02.583 --> 00:51:09.069]  They have the same fucking size flags, the same white coloring on their face, the same tan hats on.
[00:51:09.389 --> 00:51:11.030]  Get the fuck out of here.
[00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:12.952]  And why are they wearing masks, by the way?
[00:51:12.972 --> 00:51:14.313]  Because they're cowards.
[00:51:14.533 --> 00:51:14.793]  Right.
[00:51:14.993 --> 00:51:15.473]  Or they're feds.
[00:51:15.854 --> 00:51:16.294]  Yeah.
[00:51:18.135 --> 00:51:22.397]  What was the thing recently where they found out that a great percentage of the people- The Michigan thing.
[00:51:22.577 --> 00:51:22.877]  Yes.
[00:51:23.478 --> 00:51:24.058]  Explain that.
[00:51:24.278 --> 00:51:25.939]  These are the people that were trying to kidnap the governor.
[00:51:26.019 --> 00:51:26.599]  Explain that.
[00:51:26.919 --> 00:51:27.359]  I don't know.
[00:51:27.379 --> 00:51:35.283]  I didn't cover the story, but basically it was an attempt to cover- kidnap the governor of Whitmer, right?
[00:51:35.663 --> 00:51:35.863]  Yeah.
[00:51:36.644 --> 00:51:41.026]  And they found out that a higher percentage of the people involved were FBI informants.
[00:51:42.126 --> 00:51:43.147]  I just sent Jamie this.
[00:51:47.206 --> 00:51:49.308]  It's the greatest meme.
[00:51:49.588 --> 00:51:59.257]  They're all dressed up like Spider-Man and all of them says Fed, Fed, Fed, another Fed, and then one says some autistic, some poor guy that they trick into doing something.
[00:51:59.477 --> 00:52:14.008]   It was notorious in the 60s and 70s This idea of having, you know, agents provocateurs in the crowd, when they had COINTELPRO, and the assassination of Fred Hampton, the infiltration of the Black Panthers, like, you know, all this stuff.
[00:52:14.228 --> 00:52:16.970]  It was understood that the FBI did this stuff.
[00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:22.655]  Now, suddenly, people on the left disbelieve instantly that this happens.
[00:52:25.936 --> 00:52:26.816]  Did you just take my phone?
[00:52:26.836 --> 00:52:27.717]  You're video taping us?
[00:52:27.857 --> 00:52:28.717]  That's not acceptable.
[00:52:28.817 --> 00:52:30.237]  This is a public place.
[00:52:30.257 --> 00:52:31.918]  You're trying to get us in trouble, sir.
[00:52:31.998 --> 00:52:32.578]  I need a copy.
[00:52:32.838 --> 00:52:33.358]  Go find one.
[00:52:33.778 --> 00:52:34.599]  I'm deleting the video.
[00:52:34.899 --> 00:52:36.619]  No, you're not going to touch my phone.
[00:52:36.819 --> 00:52:38.040]  You're not taking a video of us.
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:40.880]  Look, dude, I recognize you.
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:42.861]  Yeah, I know you do.
[00:52:42.881 --> 00:52:43.661]  So give me my phone.
[00:52:43.681 --> 00:52:44.541]  I'm deleting the video.
[00:52:45.162 --> 00:52:48.963]  We need, we need to go, I'll say it, we need to go in.
[00:52:50.697 --> 00:52:51.217]  To the Capitol.
[00:52:51.237 --> 00:52:53.578]  Tomorrow, we need to go into the Capitol!
[00:52:53.738 --> 00:52:54.319]  Into the Capitol!
[00:52:54.339 --> 00:52:54.459]  What?
[00:52:54.499 --> 00:52:54.599]  No!
[00:52:54.679 --> 00:52:54.759]  No!
[00:52:54.819 --> 00:52:55.139]  Peacefully!

[00:53:13.347 --> 00:53:13.407]  Zen!
[00:53:13.227 --> 00:53:25.227]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have been on the air 29 years.
[00:53:26.119 --> 00:53:30.182]  And in the first 10 years I was on air, the Feds tried to infiltrate my organization.
[00:53:30.202 --> 00:53:33.864]  And I would go out and do events, and they would show up and do all sorts of stuff.
[00:53:33.884 --> 00:53:35.346]  So I learned about it very, very quickly.
[00:53:36.787 --> 00:53:41.370]  And I did a lot of things that exposed them.
[00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:45.273]  But the fact that Joe Rogan gets it now is a very, very good thing.
[00:53:45.854 --> 00:53:48.756]  The Patriot Front is run by the globalists.
[00:53:51.069 --> 00:53:52.270]  Their leaders are controlled.
[00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:54.751]  They get some useful idiots to join them.
[00:53:55.631 --> 00:54:01.855]  But it's a bunch of people going through their ROTC at college or about to get a job at the FBI.
[00:54:02.715 --> 00:54:06.257]  Let's pull up the famous photos of a rally outside the Capitol a few weeks after January 6.
[00:54:06.877 --> 00:54:15.362]  There were hundreds of young men wearing the same watches, the same shoes, so they could all identify each other, out there posing as patriots.
[00:54:16.382 --> 00:54:20.180]   And that's Guys in the FBI Academy.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:23.283]  I mean, that's what they... In fact, they identified some of them as that.
[00:54:24.044 --> 00:54:24.724]  And that's who they are!
[00:54:26.166 --> 00:54:35.736]  But after that happened, they said, okay, we're gonna put masks on, and we're gonna go out and do all of our white supremacy stuff, and the public's gonna believe it.
[00:54:35.916 --> 00:54:36.597]  And that's what this is.
[00:54:36.617 --> 00:54:37.177]  Synthetic...
[00:54:38.067 --> 00:54:38.528]  Garbage.
[00:54:38.608 --> 00:54:40.469]  And the good news is, everyone sees through it.
[00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:46.355]  So they thought, coming after me, law-fearing me to not talk about this stuff, would shut us down.
[00:54:46.635 --> 00:54:48.196]  The good news is, the whole public gets it now.
[00:54:48.777 --> 00:54:50.018]  This is Feds.
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:59.247]  Even in Idaho, they had staged arrests of them, the charges were all dropped, for a photo op, and the cops left their mask on them, and put them in the police cars in their mask.
[00:54:59.787 --> 00:55:02.650]  Under local law, national law, you don't do that.
[00:55:04.511 --> 00:55:08.054]  They gotta protect their identities so people don't find out who they are.
[00:55:10.255 --> 00:55:12.777]  Something this organized, I would say they're all feds.
[00:55:15.039 --> 00:55:21.064]  You know, even Texas Monthly, back when it was a half-piece of publication 25 years ago, did stories how they investigated the KKK and found out...
[00:55:21.997 --> 00:55:32.861]  That you go to a KKK rally, they would go to it, and the leader, the Grand Dragon was a KKK, the Grand Cyclops, that's the guy under him, was a KKK, was a Fed.
[00:55:33.542 --> 00:55:37.403]  So the head KKK guy and all their adjuncts were Feds.
[00:55:38.924 --> 00:55:40.845]  And it's the same thing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:49.043]  And they staged this because there's no real white supremacy other than a lunatic goes and shoots up a South Carolina church.
[00:55:49.083 --> 00:55:49.624]  That was real.
[00:55:50.224 --> 00:55:53.005]  Or a guy goes in and shoots up a black grocery store, mainly.
[00:55:53.345 --> 00:55:53.686]  Horrible.
[00:55:53.726 --> 00:55:54.046]  It's real.
[00:55:54.066 --> 00:55:54.846]  There are some lunatics.
[00:55:56.427 --> 00:55:58.628]  Turned out both those people had federal handlers.
[00:55:58.748 --> 00:56:00.089]  It came out in the news.
[00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:03.330]  So are there real lunatic white supremacists?
[00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:04.451]  Absolutely.
[00:56:05.091 --> 00:56:05.751]  Do they attack?
[00:56:06.892 --> 00:56:07.072]  Yeah.
[00:56:09.218 --> 00:56:13.184]  It's like, very rare, but it still goes on.
[00:56:17.478 --> 00:56:28.140]  And so what happens is, local jurisdictions get hooked up with the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, they get money, they get told, wink, wink, we're doing a drill, arrest these guys, the charges will be dropped.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.861]  Because people weren't taking the Patriot Front serious the last few years.
[00:56:32.401 --> 00:56:41.102]  So in Idaho, where they have massive, you know, anti-white supremacist funding, just because folks are going there to hide and be away from tyranny, remember what happened at Ruby Ridge?
[00:56:42.443 --> 00:56:44.503]  They needed somebody to infiltrate the quote, white supremacists.
[00:56:45.356 --> 00:56:54.522]  So they go to Randy Weaver, who recently passed, great patriot, Reamer Ray, and they say, we'll give you tens of thousands of dollars a month just to infiltrate this group.
[00:56:55.182 --> 00:56:56.123]  He said, I don't want to.
[00:56:57.043 --> 00:56:59.044]  So then they found out he sold a shotgun in a gun show.
[00:56:59.064 --> 00:57:04.087]  They said, we're gonna take you to jail, put a warrant out, went and killed his wife, killed his kids, you know, you know the rest of the story.
[00:57:05.948 --> 00:57:11.532]  But they do it over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:57:12.827 --> 00:57:14.008]  Remember the Viper Militia?
[00:57:14.088 --> 00:57:18.210]  It was a meth-dealing motorcycle gang on the West Coast.
[00:57:18.691 --> 00:57:20.692]  The Feds didn't have a real militia that was criminal.
[00:57:21.433 --> 00:57:29.098]  So they infiltrated, they led it for several years, they gave them hundreds of thousands of dollars, and then they busted them as soon as they could call it a militia.
[00:57:29.698 --> 00:57:32.940]  So you'd have a headline, Meth-Dealing Militia Planned All These Attacks.
[00:57:33.981 --> 00:57:40.505]  It's the same story over and over and over again.
[00:57:42.381 --> 00:57:43.121]  This is what they do.
[00:57:44.963 --> 00:57:45.663]  And it's shameful.
[00:57:46.924 --> 00:57:48.425]  It's absolutely criminal in my view.
[00:57:49.045 --> 00:57:50.786]  Toll-free number to join us, 877-789-2539.
[00:57:52.527 --> 00:57:54.388]  We're taking first-time callers on the U.N.
[00:57:54.408 --> 00:57:59.271]  saying we got rid of the last COVID emergency because we're getting ready for a new pandemic that targets children.
[00:57:59.531 --> 00:58:01.152]  Hey, print me that Bill Gates article, I forgot that.
[00:58:02.953 --> 00:58:09.257]  We're talking about the Durham report, confirming what we already knew, that the feds made it all up and the CIA was involved.
[00:58:10.517 --> 00:58:13.754]   We can talk about The Russia situation, Ukraine.
[00:58:13.794 --> 00:58:15.495]  We can talk about the economy.
[00:58:15.535 --> 00:58:16.796]  We can talk about Patriot Front.
[00:58:16.816 --> 00:58:17.916]  We can talk about AI.
[00:58:19.197 --> 00:58:20.198]  We can talk about all of it.
[00:58:20.238 --> 00:58:25.961]  I've got so much news I haven't gotten to that I'm going to intersperse coming up here today.
[00:58:26.001 --> 00:58:32.445]  But the good news is everybody's Alex Jones now, or at least a large portion of the population.
[00:58:32.465 --> 00:58:34.586]  It's not just Joe Rogan.
[00:58:35.981 --> 00:58:37.261]  It's not just Tucker Carlson.
[00:58:37.281 --> 00:58:38.862]  It's not just Steve Bannon.
[00:58:39.642 --> 00:58:41.843]  It's not just Jack Posobiec.
[00:58:42.003 --> 00:58:43.243]  It's not just Charlie Kirk.
[00:58:44.424 --> 00:58:45.704]  It's not just Drew Hernandez.
[00:58:46.684 --> 00:58:47.845]  It's not just Owen Schroer.
[00:58:49.545 --> 00:59:01.689]  It is the general public now figures out who gains, what's the history, how's this work, how's this scam work, and now our people, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, you name it, are everywhere.
[00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:05.050]  Are everywhere.
[00:59:06.644 --> 00:59:08.785]  Saying, we don't want to be part of this.
[00:59:09.285 --> 00:59:10.466]  We see what's going on.
[00:59:10.526 --> 00:59:14.668]  And once you see it, somebody can't be told about the Matrix like Morpheus says.
[00:59:15.969 --> 00:59:17.569]  You gotta see it for yourself.
[00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:24.833]  And once you see the Matrix, there is no going back from that.
[00:59:26.534 --> 00:59:29.715]  That's an exciting point to be at historically with humanity.
[00:59:30.276 --> 00:59:32.337]  So we got so much news today.
[00:59:33.017 --> 00:59:33.377]  Woo!
[00:59:34.478 --> 00:59:37.906]   We've only reached 30% of the show.
[00:59:38.587 --> 00:59:40.088]  So there's so much more coming up.
[00:59:40.449 --> 00:59:41.490]  Please be Paul Reveres.
[00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:42.911]  Tell folks to tune in now.
[00:59:42.931 --> 00:59:43.492]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:44.252 --> 00:59:47.396]  All right, we have loaded phone lines, and it's always great to take your calls.
[00:59:47.516 --> 00:59:49.958]  You take us in so many amazing directions.
[00:59:49.978 --> 00:59:56.085]  But let me give you a little prelude to some of the other stuff we're going to be covering here today.
[00:59:57.441 --> 01:00:02.423]  Cable news ratings dropped to all-time low in their history of CNN.
[01:00:02.443 --> 01:00:04.284]  They have less viewers than Newsmax.
[01:00:05.004 --> 01:00:05.704]  That's exciting.
[01:00:05.824 --> 01:00:10.126]  Old video of E. Jean Carroll, the one that says Trump raped her.
[01:00:10.226 --> 01:00:12.987]  The jury found him not guilty, but said he's not allowed to say he's innocent.
[01:00:13.387 --> 01:00:16.209]  Confirms she's a wackadoodle in a crazy video we're going to air.
[01:00:16.909 --> 01:00:26.833]  We've got a bunch of chilling videos where women now tell eight-month-old babies that asking for milk or touching them is assault.
[01:00:27.984 --> 01:00:28.524]  Not joking.
[01:00:28.844 --> 01:00:29.404]  It's coming up.
[01:00:31.245 --> 01:00:36.087]  We also have Elon Musk subpoenaed by U.S.
[01:00:36.107 --> 01:00:39.288]  Virgin Islands as part of lawsuit to Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring.
[01:00:40.428 --> 01:00:42.489]  Is Elon Musk connected?
[01:00:42.529 --> 01:00:44.289]  And I'm not an apologist for Elon Musk.
[01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:46.830]  But wait till we get to this article.
[01:00:48.471 --> 01:00:54.933]  The Virgin Islands admits that they have no evidence he was ever with Jeffrey Epstein or on the island.
[01:00:56.638 --> 01:01:07.806]  But that Epstein's documents show he, quote, turned over information from high-value rich people to someone else so that because he's rich, he's now a suspect.
[01:01:08.886 --> 01:01:13.229]  Meanwhile, Bill Gates is on the list dozens of times going to the island.
[01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:15.131]  He's not being investigated.
[01:01:15.631 --> 01:01:17.412]  This, we're going to get to that.
[01:01:19.639 --> 01:01:25.443]  Big article on Zero Hedge, America's powerful intellectual class finds joy in making us obey and be compliant.
[01:01:25.723 --> 01:01:26.763]  Warren's top scholar.
[01:01:27.824 --> 01:01:29.085]  We've got a backlash.
[01:01:29.145 --> 01:01:32.747]  Miller Lite has said, hey, hold my beer to Budweiser.
[01:01:35.649 --> 01:01:39.311]  Putting out a video just as crazy as the Dylan Mulvaney video.
[01:01:40.552 --> 01:01:42.013]  We've got a bunch of economy news.
[01:01:42.613 --> 01:01:45.095]  So much here to cover today.
[01:01:47.409 --> 01:01:58.615]  But right now, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go to your phone calls to Rockstar, Patrick, Zion, John, Pete, Wayne, Steve, Jim, Jordan, Doug, and others.
[01:01:59.055 --> 01:02:00.876]  First up, Zion in Maine.
[01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:01.557]  Thanks for calling.
[01:02:04.657 --> 01:02:06.277]  Yes, hi, glad to be on your show.
[01:02:06.317 --> 01:02:07.158]  Thank you for having me.
[01:02:07.218 --> 01:02:09.258]  I have a bit of breaking news.
[01:02:09.698 --> 01:02:14.339]  So with the Title 42, and I know it's a bit off topic, but with the... No, no, there's no topic.
[01:02:14.359 --> 01:02:17.060]  That's why it's totally open phones, any subject you want.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.880]  I threw out some topics I'd like to hear from you on, but it's open phones, brother.
[01:02:21.461 --> 01:02:26.762]  So with this Title 42 thing, I'm sitting right next to Portland International Jetport right now.
[01:02:28.722 --> 01:02:38.491]   And overnight, I actually have been kept up because There have been airplanes, and I know the airplane route, have been coming in from different angles.
[01:02:38.751 --> 01:02:44.635]  There's actually big things about noise ordinances near the airport, so they come in a different angle.
[01:02:44.996 --> 01:02:53.322]  But they've been coming in the old route, these planes, and I'm actually so close to the airport that I can just walk over there and see what's going on.
[01:02:53.942 --> 01:02:58.365]  And there is a bunch of black vans and feds and antifa garbage.
[01:02:59.938 --> 01:03:10.486]  I'm pretty sure they're bringing in immigrants because I've been seeing planes full of people getting unloaded and sent off on buses throughout the great state of Maine.
[01:03:11.347 --> 01:03:23.276]  Well, sir, there's no doubt they're shipping a ton of people to the areas in the East Coast, particularly Maine, and into that big military base that's up there.
[01:03:23.436 --> 01:03:24.978]  Is that the airport you're by?
[01:03:26.816 --> 01:03:29.418]  Uh, there's no, well, I don't know.
[01:03:29.558 --> 01:03:30.418]  Are you at Bangor?
[01:03:31.919 --> 01:03:32.900]  No, I'm in Portland.
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:33.961]  That's why.
[01:03:34.001 --> 01:03:35.021]  That's a couple hours north.
[01:03:35.041 --> 01:03:36.322]  Yeah, but this is what I love.
[01:03:36.422 --> 01:03:39.544]  You know, you've called him with an anecdotal example and that's important, that's great.
[01:03:39.964 --> 01:03:45.608]  Sir, it's confirmed, hundreds of thousands a month come across, they put them on planes and fly them across the country.
[01:03:45.948 --> 01:03:54.353]  So, yeah, they have secret 2 in the morning flights to New York, to Florida, to North Texas, to California, to Maine.
[01:03:54.813 --> 01:03:55.853]  That's what I'm going to do tonight.
[01:03:55.873 --> 01:03:57.274]  I'd be glad to send it to y'all.
[01:03:57.114 --> 01:04:00.833]   flying them to so yeah I mean if you're seeing vans pull up in the middle of
[01:04:00.833 --> 01:04:03.773]   night for a bunch of planes and only normal and there you should go up the
[01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:06.673]   fence and get video of it and put it out but yeah I've been of course it's going
[01:04:06.673 --> 01:04:11.713]   on that's what I'm gonna do tonight I'd be glad to send it to y'all I'm gonna
[01:04:11.713 --> 01:04:16.114]   put it on my channel and everything what is your channel and CC it to show tips
[01:04:16.114 --> 01:04:23.833]   and then full wars calm but - what's your channel my channel is maga one four eight
[01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:26.331]  I'm on YouTube and on Rumble.
[01:04:27.311 --> 01:04:28.072]  Well do it, brother.
[01:04:28.092 --> 01:04:29.433]  That is what you should be doing.
[01:04:29.473 --> 01:04:30.734]  But yes, it's going on.
[01:04:31.735 --> 01:04:32.235]  It's happening.
[01:04:32.355 --> 01:04:34.557]  Our government facilitates the illegal invasion.
[01:04:34.997 --> 01:04:35.918]  Thank you, Zion.
[01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:37.680]  John in Texas.
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:38.320]  You're on the air.
[01:04:40.222 --> 01:04:40.662]  Hi, Alex.
[01:04:42.323 --> 01:04:44.845]  Well, four weeks ago, I came down with a virus.
[01:04:46.126 --> 01:04:48.148]  On Monday, it started out with a small cough.
[01:04:49.116 --> 01:04:52.917]  Tuesday, it was a major cough and I just took a nose dive right into my lungs.
[01:04:53.338 --> 01:04:53.618]  Oh yeah.
[01:04:54.358 --> 01:05:00.780]  Now for eight days, I couldn't lay down and sleep at night because all my lungs were gurgling and I was coughing.
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:02.681]  I had to sleep in a chair for eight days.
[01:05:02.821 --> 01:05:03.601]  Yeah, that's COVID.
[01:05:04.182 --> 01:05:05.762]  Yeah, and they say COVID's dead.
[01:05:05.822 --> 01:05:06.302]  It's not.
[01:05:06.943 --> 01:05:11.064]  It keeps mutating because they gave those vaccines that caused the mutation.
[01:05:11.804 --> 01:05:17.527]  Well, my lady friend's daughter, who's a schoolteacher in Austin, has been going through the Austin School District.
[01:05:17.567 --> 01:05:18.307]  She came down with it.
[01:05:18.846 --> 01:05:22.208]  She went to the doctor, and they took tests, and they said, well, it's not the COVID.
[01:05:22.628 --> 01:05:24.129]  They said, we've never seen this before.
[01:05:24.149 --> 01:05:24.890]  We don't know what it is.
[01:05:26.231 --> 01:05:30.053]  Yeah, because once it mutates, they can't track it with that test.
[01:05:30.073 --> 01:05:32.294]  But it's a mutation.
[01:05:32.654 --> 01:05:33.455]  It's happening everywhere.
[01:05:33.695 --> 01:05:35.796]  There's more COVID deaths this year than last year.
[01:05:35.816 --> 01:05:38.078]  And it's not the killing of folks with ventilators.
[01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:42.160]  They created this mutagenic system.
[01:05:43.201 --> 01:05:44.322]  It took, you know, eight days.
[01:05:44.702 --> 01:05:46.223]  Luckily, I know everything about what it was.
[01:05:46.243 --> 01:05:47.664]  You don't have to tell me about it.
[01:05:49.148 --> 01:05:51.390]  I've never had anything like it when I had it two years ago.
[01:05:51.911 --> 01:05:53.532]  People say it isn't real, they're full of crap.
[01:05:53.652 --> 01:05:55.014]  It is, it is something else.
[01:05:55.634 --> 01:06:00.979]  Well, I've had the regular COVID, I've had the Della variant, and I had the Omicron a couple times, the milder version.
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:02.521]  This was worse than that.
[01:06:02.541 --> 01:06:05.143]  There was a couple days where I thought maybe I ain't gonna make it.
[01:06:05.463 --> 01:06:06.865]  I hear you, it's scary as hell.
[01:06:06.965 --> 01:06:08.646]  No, they've hit us hard, brother.
[01:06:08.987 --> 01:06:12.490]  And they're using the COVID release as a cover for a bunch of other stuff they're releasing, believe me.
[01:06:13.561 --> 01:06:20.226]  And that's what they mean by, oh, it's over, the new thing's coming, is because they are mad scientists, eugenicists, John.
[01:06:20.606 --> 01:06:21.667]  And John, I recognize your voice.
[01:06:21.687 --> 01:06:23.208]  You've been calling decades.
[01:06:24.128 --> 01:06:24.889]  So good to have you call.
[01:06:24.929 --> 01:06:25.949]  I'm glad I didn't kill you, brother.
[01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:27.130]  Yeah, I'm glad.
[01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:28.411]  I'm still hanging in there, too, Alex.
[01:06:28.591 --> 01:06:29.172]  What'd you take?
[01:06:29.192 --> 01:06:36.357]  Because let me tell you, inhalable steroids, ivermectin, zinc, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin work like a charm.
[01:06:37.117 --> 01:06:42.601]  Yeah, well, I took vitamins, anything antiviral, the supplements.
[01:06:43.493 --> 01:06:51.336]  I took quinine water, I boosted it with my own home-brewed quinine, boosted it up.
[01:06:51.917 --> 01:06:54.118]  I took about four aspirin a day.
[01:06:54.878 --> 01:07:04.002]  And of course, the Dr. Zelenko, when I had the Jell-O variant, when Dr. Zelenko was on there, he basically saved my life because it was going down on my lungs too.
[01:07:04.362 --> 01:07:11.085]  And when I started taking Quercetin, after he told me, it came right up out of my lungs and then went away.
[01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:16.415]  Well, that's right, and we have a lowering life expectancy worldwide.
[01:07:16.495 --> 01:07:17.115]  They have hit us.
[01:07:17.756 --> 01:07:21.660]  Did you hear about the military 500% increase in HIV since the vaccine?
[01:07:23.442 --> 01:07:24.943]  Yeah, I heard you talking about it.
[01:07:25.204 --> 01:07:27.966]  I mean, they are, brother, they are hitting us hard.
[01:07:28.347 --> 01:07:29.448]  Good to hear you're better, John.
[01:07:29.488 --> 01:07:30.048]  God bless you.
[01:07:30.169 --> 01:07:30.769]  Yeah, it's bad.
[01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:32.271]  These bastards.
[01:07:33.575 --> 01:07:35.176]  In fact, the bastard's a great person, apparently.
[01:07:35.216 --> 01:07:35.976]  That's not a fair name.
[01:07:36.016 --> 01:07:38.017]  He's murdering satanic criminals.
[01:07:38.757 --> 01:07:40.078]  Steve and Tennessee are on the air.
[01:07:40.118 --> 01:07:40.458]  Go ahead.
[01:07:40.778 --> 01:07:41.098]  Oh, nope.
[01:07:41.198 --> 01:07:41.659]  Gotta go to break.
[01:07:41.679 --> 01:07:41.959]  Sorry.
[01:07:42.319 --> 01:07:43.860]  Didn't look at the clock.
[01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:45.740]  We'll come right back to you, Steve.
[01:07:46.801 --> 01:07:49.662]  Everybody else, the orders, your calls are received.

[01:08:09.276 --> 01:08:14.900]  All right, we're going to go right back to your phone calls here in just a moment, but I just want to say this again.

[01:08:17.342 --> 01:08:17.922]  You're amazing.
[01:08:17.942 --> 01:08:18.603]  You spread the word.
[01:08:18.663 --> 01:08:19.243]  It's incredible.
[01:08:20.144 --> 01:08:21.805]  But you really are the power of this broadcast.

[01:08:44.959 --> 01:08:47.381]  The government's lowered the daily allowance you're supposedly going to have.
[01:08:48.181 --> 01:08:51.983]  It is the thing that energizes your brain, your cells, and so much more.

[01:09:24.183 --> 01:09:25.764]  God has given us so many great compounds.
[01:09:25.784 --> 01:09:31.668]  We have the highest quality CBD oil at more than half off what any competitors sell the same thousand milligram systems for.

[01:09:48.936 --> 01:09:55.239]  A very small percentage of you ever go to the store or buy anything, you really need these products you're missing out, plus we need to stay on air.
[01:09:55.499 --> 01:09:56.260]  That's a win-win.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.181]  Hey Alex, thanks for getting me on.
[01:09:58.221 --> 01:10:00.223]  Hey, I just want to call out, where are the dang Republicans on anything?
[01:10:00.763 --> 01:10:02.464]  You know, they're not anywhere on the border.
[01:10:02.284 --> 01:10:07.284]   you on the fence. Take action now. Infowars.com and I thank you humbly for your support and
[01:10:07.284 --> 01:10:13.284]   salute you. All right. Up next, Steve in Tennessee, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:10:13.284 --> 01:10:17.643]   Hey, Alex, thanks for getting me on. Hey, I just want to call out where are the dang
[01:10:17.643 --> 01:10:23.483]   Republicans on anything? You know, they're not they're not anywhere on the border. They're
[01:10:23.483 --> 01:10:27.284]  not talking about trying to get out of the U.N. or the W.F.
[01:10:27.284 --> 01:10:30.604]   They're not talking about arresting Gates or Fauci. You're moving on him.
[01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:31.130]  Nothing.
[01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:32.891]  They're just, McCarthy's just nothing.
[01:10:34.572 --> 01:10:38.434]  I'm, I'm thinking a way to get out of this because Carlin says you can't vote.
[01:10:38.454 --> 01:10:40.255]  If voting mattered, they wouldn't let you do it.
[01:10:40.815 --> 01:10:47.219]  So I'm thinking send Davos or Bilderberg a nice big fat juicy scud next time they meet and that'll get their attention.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:49.961]  What do you think?
[01:10:50.021 --> 01:10:51.442]  Well, you're putting me on the spot there.
[01:10:52.023 --> 01:10:54.505]  Does Bill Gates deserve to go to prison?
[01:10:54.525 --> 01:10:56.166]  Does Klaus Schwab deserve to go to prison?
[01:10:56.966 --> 01:10:58.568]  Does Barack Obama deserve to go to prison?
[01:10:58.608 --> 01:10:58.908]  Yes.
[01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:03.611]  But I can't sit here and call for violence when I'm not the one doing it.
[01:11:04.272 --> 01:11:07.294]  And so I'm going to work as hard as I can to fix this peacefully.
[01:11:07.995 --> 01:11:12.278]  And at the point that we move to violence means we've really not done our job.
[01:11:15.049 --> 01:11:26.512]  Yeah, the Republican leadership, you know, there are a lot of people like Josh Hawley and even Ted Cruz, though I don't trust him, and Senator Paul and a lot of others that are actually telling the truth.
[01:11:26.533 --> 01:11:28.473]  They're just not getting magnified what's happening.
[01:11:28.953 --> 01:11:30.714]  They have been exposing a lot of things in hearings.
[01:11:30.774 --> 01:11:33.255]  But yeah, it's, you're right, it's not strong enough.
[01:11:36.204 --> 01:11:41.051]  I would say if the globalists did have the fear of God in them, they would stop doing what they're doing.
[01:11:41.091 --> 01:11:43.775]  They're doing all this because they feel like there's no repercussions.
[01:11:43.815 --> 01:11:50.093]   The problem is, is that I mean, who's going to make these decisions?
[01:11:50.334 --> 01:11:50.954]  Who's going to do this?
[01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:58.522]  Because if we had a Hitler that could be taken out, like they tried in Operation Valkyrie, then I would say take Hitler out.
[01:11:58.862 --> 01:12:04.768]  But it's a bureaucracy, it's a mindset, it's a spirit, it's a system, it's an oligarchy.
[01:12:05.428 --> 01:12:11.734]  And so you have to ideologically fight it and also not support it, because let me tell you, you know shark teeth.
[01:12:12.608 --> 01:12:15.630]  They got six, seven rows growing when the one row goes up.
[01:12:16.171 --> 01:12:17.492]  And more teeth are always growing.
[01:12:18.172 --> 01:12:21.455]  And so you take out one row of teeth, they got another row of teeth.
[01:12:21.855 --> 01:12:23.116]  You gotta kill the shark.
[01:12:23.156 --> 01:12:24.237]  You gotta kill the idea.
[01:12:24.297 --> 01:12:26.899]  You gotta expose the whole satanic system.
[01:12:26.919 --> 01:12:27.860]  Does that make sense?
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:29.761]  That makes perfect sense.
[01:12:29.781 --> 01:12:31.783]  So does the scud on top of Devo's.
[01:12:32.423 --> 01:12:38.788]  Well, I'll say this, and I don't want anybody to carry anything offensive or violent, because they'll spit it against us, probably do it to themselves as opposed to saviors.
[01:12:39.589 --> 01:12:40.510]  I would not cry.
[01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:44.392]  If God struck all of them with a bolt of lightning.
[01:12:44.833 --> 01:12:47.034]  But God says vengeance is mine, so that's where I'm at.
[01:12:48.615 --> 01:12:49.036]  I hear you.
[01:12:49.096 --> 01:12:50.477]  I guess we'll just keep on keeping on.
[01:12:50.497 --> 01:13:03.787]  There's something that I've been doing that other people could do that might help wake the sleeping masses up, is I had cards printed up with your website and, you know, other websites, AE911Truth, GeoengineeringWatch, that kind of stuff.
[01:13:04.348 --> 01:13:10.813]  I ordered some cards from GeoengineeringWatch, and I just hand them out, put them in gas pumps, leave them in stores.
[01:13:11.215 --> 01:13:14.236]  Give a bundle of them to my friends and stuff and have them do it.
[01:13:14.876 --> 01:13:15.257]  I don't know.
[01:13:15.457 --> 01:13:17.558]  It's something to get the name and get stuff out there.
[01:13:19.098 --> 01:13:20.159]  Well, let me say this, brother.
[01:13:20.879 --> 01:13:22.620]  I'm not poo-pooing what you're saying, Steve.
[01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:28.102]  They've well past the line of where we have a right defensively to defend ourselves.
[01:13:28.842 --> 01:13:32.683]  Obi-Wan Kenobi says the force is for defense and knowledge, never for attack.
[01:13:34.144 --> 01:13:41.271]  We've got to be wise as serpents, peaceful as doves, and realize that anything we do, they're going to spit against us.
[01:13:41.731 --> 01:13:44.374]  And they've got ten deep people ready to take their place.
[01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:51.481]  We have to pull out of their system, not comply, expose it every day, and believe me, it's not going well for them.
[01:13:51.841 --> 01:13:53.623]  I mean, they plan to keep the lockdowns going.
[01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:55.485]  They already plan to have force injections.
[01:13:55.505 --> 01:13:56.526]  They've had to back off that.
[01:13:56.886 --> 01:13:58.207]  They hurt a lot of people in the process.
[01:13:59.338 --> 01:14:07.644]  As bad as it is, because the people like you, Steve, on the grassroots, on the ground, who aren't astroturf, we've got a fighting chance.
[01:14:07.664 --> 01:14:09.506]  So keep up what you're doing and God bless you.
[01:14:10.626 --> 01:14:17.632]  And look, I don't know what I'd do if I saw Bill Gates on the street.
[01:14:20.033 --> 01:14:21.234]  And that's a decision for you to make.
[01:14:22.455 --> 01:14:26.638]  But, here's a microcosm, okay?
[01:14:29.053 --> 01:14:40.981]  If Joe Biden goes out to talk at some union somewhere and somebody smuggles a handgun in and shoots him twice in the chest, would it be good that Joe Biden was shot and died on the podium or bad?
[01:14:42.181 --> 01:14:42.582]  No, no.
[01:14:43.022 --> 01:14:44.683]  Kind of let the Jeopardy music play.
[01:14:44.703 --> 01:14:50.367]  Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
[01:14:50.427 --> 01:14:51.387]  Isn't that the Jeopardy music?
[01:14:51.667 --> 01:14:52.548]  See if you guys can pull it up.
[01:14:54.258 --> 01:14:54.999]  Would it be good?
[01:14:55.019 --> 01:14:56.060]  Maybe I should ask that question.
[01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.061]  I'm not calling for it.
[01:14:57.101 --> 01:14:58.102]  Don't spin that media.
[01:14:58.803 --> 01:15:09.914]  Would it be good if Joe Biden or if somebody got in the crowd behind him and smote him with a knife and jumped on him from behind and stabbed him right in the back of the neck and killed him?
[01:15:10.654 --> 01:15:12.654]  Would it be good?
[01:15:12.654 --> 01:15:17.654]  [Humming]
[01:15:17.654 --> 01:15:19.654]  Come on, you know the answer!
[01:15:19.582 --> 01:15:26.285]  It would turn that cryptkeeper, that blob, that hated monster, that person turning everybody off against them.
[01:15:27.226 --> 01:15:28.386]  They wanted a puppet, they got one.
[01:15:29.407 --> 01:15:31.308]  That would turn him into a martyr.
[01:15:32.108 --> 01:15:33.569]  That would turn him into a victim.
[01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:41.713]  In fact, if I was on a stage with Joe Biden, and somebody pulled a gun out to shoot him, I would jump in front of the bullets.
[01:15:41.853 --> 01:15:42.174]  I would.
[01:15:43.354 --> 01:15:44.415]  But I wouldn't be on a stage with Biden.
[01:15:45.123 --> 01:15:46.204]  Not because I like Biden.
[01:15:46.505 --> 01:15:47.406]  I hate him.
[01:15:48.007 --> 01:15:49.549]  I want to politically destroy him.
[01:15:49.829 --> 01:15:52.993]  I want to politically, non-violently assassinate his ideas.
[01:15:55.677 --> 01:16:02.746]  And so, I would jump in front of bullets for Joe Biden because I don't want that sack of pedophilic garbage to be a victim.
[01:16:05.086 --> 01:16:11.427]  I want to take the system back, I want to indict him, I want to see him in prison, and I want to see his son in prison, and I want to see his controllers in prison.
[01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:15.128]  And if the jury gives him the death penalty for human trafficking and all of it, hey, great!
[01:16:15.808 --> 01:16:29.851]  Once they're convicted, and once they've had their appeal, I will volunteer to release the poison gas, or to pull the lever on the electric chair, or to give the order for the firing squad.
[01:16:30.891 --> 01:16:33.772]  But not until they're convicted due process, because we're not like them.
[01:16:34.807 --> 01:16:35.647]  But he's a puppet.
[01:16:36.108 --> 01:16:43.852]  We don't want a hair on his pedophile head harmed, because that's how they will grab victory from the jaws of defeat.
[01:16:44.892 --> 01:17:02.422]  Ask yourselves, if Joe Biden was driving in his motorcade, and some right-winger, you know, be the feds, planted 20 pounds of explosives in the road, and it blew the car up, it's armored, it wouldn't go through it, but it would blow the car up, and it falls and he breaks his neck.
[01:17:03.809 --> 01:17:07.512]  Would it be good if Joe Biden got blown off a highway or bad?
[01:17:08.452 --> 01:17:09.253]  It would be bad.
[01:17:09.934 --> 01:17:12.175]  Pray that he doesn't get assassinated.
[01:17:12.976 --> 01:17:17.399]  Pray they don't use that as the igniter to take over society.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:19.260]  Pray.
[01:17:20.001 --> 01:17:21.842]  Don't go out and start anything, folks.
[01:17:22.483 --> 01:17:23.904]  And don't go out and kill anybody.
[01:17:25.049 --> 01:17:27.730]  We are destroying Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and George Soros.
[01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:29.430]  In fact, I got a George Soros story.
[01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:29.810]  Where is it?
[01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:30.370]  I got it right here.
[01:17:31.050 --> 01:17:32.830]  About this exact subject when we come back.
[01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.771]  And then your phone call.
[01:17:33.791 --> 01:17:34.151]  Stay with us.
[01:17:35.131 --> 01:17:35.911]  Michael Young coming up.
[01:17:36.571 --> 01:17:42.332]  Folks are having a lot of fun online with George Soros and what he tweeted yesterday.
[01:17:42.872 --> 01:17:44.733]  Last time I checked it had 4 million views.
[01:17:44.913 --> 01:17:45.573]  That was last night.
[01:17:45.593 --> 01:17:47.453]  It's probably a lot more today.
[01:17:48.193 --> 01:17:49.694]  But he said, I've not had a heart attack.
[01:17:50.574 --> 01:17:51.594]  Here's a little clip of Soros.
[01:17:54.139 --> 01:18:15.918]  So, uh, it's a tragic, uh, role that they are playing because of the tremendous, uh, pain.
[01:18:20.662 --> 01:18:21.563]  It's quite the metaphor.
[01:18:22.503 --> 01:18:25.786]  All right, so I saw this yesterday and had like four billion views.
[01:18:25.806 --> 01:18:31.231]  We can put the tweet up right now and see what it has now, but I shouldn't do this, but it's a guilty pleasure.
[01:18:31.251 --> 01:18:32.652]  I was not driving myself.
[01:18:32.672 --> 01:18:36.916]  I had a great security guy with me after I was on Crowder's show yesterday that I hosted my own show.
[01:18:37.397 --> 01:18:40.239]  Then we got in the car and drove back to three and a half hours from Dallas.
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:43.783]  And so I took about an hour nap because I barely got any sleep the night before.
[01:18:44.163 --> 01:18:46.125]  Got in Dallas about midnight, got up about 6 a.m.
[01:18:47.941 --> 01:18:48.661]  Hadn't slept too well.
[01:18:49.542 --> 01:18:55.485]  But for about an hour I got online and I read, as a guilty pleasure, hundreds of the 10,000 comments.
[01:18:56.285 --> 01:18:57.046]  That's how many were there.
[01:18:58.006 --> 01:19:01.948]  And 99% of them were anti-George Soros.
[01:19:02.369 --> 01:19:05.090]  Which shows, even on Twitter, how's it going for the New World Order?
[01:19:05.670 --> 01:19:06.591]  And what was his tweet?
[01:19:06.631 --> 01:19:07.711]  What were they responding to?
[01:19:07.771 --> 01:19:08.412]  I'll show it to you.
[01:19:09.532 --> 01:19:12.574]  Twitter users disappointed, George Soros still alive.
[01:19:12.954 --> 01:19:14.575]  Here's the InfoWars.com article.
[01:19:16.089 --> 01:19:18.791]  He said, rumors that I had a heart attack are completely false.
[01:19:19.031 --> 01:19:20.892]  I am alive and healthy.
[01:19:20.912 --> 01:19:22.933]  I think that's a lie, that he's healthy.
[01:19:23.353 --> 01:19:26.115]  Soros wrote in response to the rumors of his demise.
[01:19:27.155 --> 01:19:30.657]  And again, it's 5.5 million views right now, so it was 4 million yesterday.
[01:19:31.298 --> 01:19:33.699]  So, tens of thousands of comments.
[01:19:33.819 --> 01:19:40.323]  I spent probably 30 minutes I didn't have reading them, and I think I saw one comment that was friendly out of hundreds.
[01:19:41.670 --> 01:19:49.852]  So, all his PR isn't going too well for all the crimes that he has, all the crimes that he's committed.
[01:19:50.532 --> 01:19:53.373]  But I think Mark Twain said it best.
[01:19:53.413 --> 01:19:59.254]  He said, I've never wished a man dead, but I have read some obituaries with great pleasure.
[01:20:03.195 --> 01:20:09.197]  Yeah, don't worry, old Satan's got hell in his little red pajamas heated up really nice for you, Baba.
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:14.383]  So you can run, but you can't, you can't hide.
[01:20:15.604 --> 01:20:25.810]  Overthrown so many countries, stole so many pension funds, was a Nazi collaborator, ADL King, and he can try whatever he wants, but nobody is going along with what you're doing.
[01:20:27.951 --> 01:20:29.733]  Nobody is buying into your garbage.
[01:20:30.613 --> 01:20:33.315]  Yeah, so while we take calls, let's just scroll through the tweets.
[01:20:35.770 --> 01:20:40.051]  about George Soros and his untimely death that did not happen.
[01:20:41.672 --> 01:20:43.412]  And so, see, he's living a living death.
[01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:44.753]  Almost everyone hates him.
[01:20:45.293 --> 01:20:46.433]  He's seen and reviled.
[01:20:47.253 --> 01:20:49.534]  And so, what would it do if somebody killed George Soros?
[01:20:49.554 --> 01:20:52.375]  He's already dead, spiritually.
[01:20:52.395 --> 01:20:53.215]  It would make him a victim.
[01:20:54.255 --> 01:20:55.555]  No, we don't want to kill George Soros.
[01:20:55.595 --> 01:20:57.176]  He's already got his empire, his system.
[01:20:58.216 --> 01:20:58.996]  It's like Black Rock.
[01:20:59.497 --> 01:21:03.867]   We don't want to kill Larry Fink That has quadrillions under management.
[01:21:04.267 --> 01:21:10.193]  We want to kill his operation with the State Attorney General's other leaders saying you're not going to bring in SEGs and U.N.
[01:21:10.233 --> 01:21:12.515]  control and social credit scores, which is happening.
[01:21:13.976 --> 01:21:15.398]  We kill their operation.
[01:21:15.678 --> 01:21:16.659]  We kill their program.
[01:21:16.699 --> 01:21:17.360]  We pull out of it.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.421]  We don't support it.
[01:21:18.461 --> 01:21:19.201]  We don't submit.
[01:21:20.262 --> 01:21:24.386]  They got plenty of evil people lined up behind them ready to cover the, you know, carry this out.
[01:21:24.767 --> 01:21:26.909]  We kill their operation.
[01:21:28.721 --> 01:21:30.823]  All right, let's go to Jordan in Michigan.
[01:21:30.843 --> 01:21:32.184]  Jordan, thanks for holding here on the air.
[01:21:34.186 --> 01:21:35.467]  Jones, can you hear me, sir?
[01:21:35.807 --> 01:21:36.307]  I can, brother.
[01:21:36.347 --> 01:21:36.648]  Go ahead.
[01:21:38.169 --> 01:21:38.489]  All right.
[01:21:38.549 --> 01:21:39.070]  Thank you, sir.
[01:21:40.071 --> 01:21:42.232]  First of all, quick plug, Rainforest Plus.
[01:21:42.533 --> 01:21:42.913]  Love it.
[01:21:42.933 --> 01:21:48.137]  The only downside is that I wish it was more than one capsule, but that's why I buy two capsules per shipment.
[01:21:48.698 --> 01:22:05.603]   With that said, I'm starting to become a fully licensed personal financial advisor, and my VP recommends that I listen to Fox Business and CNN Business and find the truth in the middle when it comes to giving my clients financial advice.
[01:22:06.243 --> 01:22:10.184]  Do you believe that to be true or do you have a better recommendation for all of us, sir?
[01:22:10.584 --> 01:22:12.484]  I think that's absolutely idiotic.
[01:22:13.124 --> 01:22:18.926]  I think Fox Business overall is a hundred times better than CNN Business.
[01:22:19.546 --> 01:22:21.686]  CNN's total deception to manipulate you.
[01:22:22.666 --> 01:22:30.106]   CNBC with Their advisors, particularly Kramer, is the worst.
[01:22:30.146 --> 01:22:31.106]  They're worse than CNN.
[01:22:31.126 --> 01:22:33.187]  So the bottom is Kramer.
[01:22:33.527 --> 01:22:39.089]  Kramer always tells retail investors, invest in something before they implode it.
[01:22:39.429 --> 01:22:41.809]  So he's the pump-and-dump king, or prop-up king.
[01:22:41.829 --> 01:22:42.650]  It's not always a pump-and-dump.
[01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:43.830]  Sometimes it's an old company.
[01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:46.251]  So do the opposite of what Kramer says.
[01:22:48.031 --> 01:22:49.411]  I wouldn't even listen to CNN.
[01:22:50.292 --> 01:22:58.145]   And Fox Business, I would say, I watch it quite a bit, I'd say it's It's not super sophisticated, but it's okay.
[01:22:59.085 --> 01:23:03.268]  You should be reading Zero Hedge for your financial information.
[01:23:03.548 --> 01:23:08.992]  I would be getting Zero Hedge, and that's what I do.
[01:23:09.212 --> 01:23:17.097]  But investing to me is a moral thing, and so obviously defense stocks are going to go up, obviously biotech stocks.
[01:23:17.157 --> 01:23:18.358]  I could have invested in Pfizer.
[01:23:19.339 --> 01:23:21.360]  I don't do that, so I make moral decisions.
[01:23:22.501 --> 01:23:23.782]  I'm not saying you're bad to invest places.
[01:23:24.402 --> 01:23:25.243]  I'm out in the stock market.
[01:23:27.208 --> 01:23:28.390]  Uh, though I follow it.
[01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:29.452]  Trends Journal is great as well.
[01:23:30.213 --> 01:23:32.837]  And so, that's where I'm at.
[01:23:32.997 --> 01:23:33.518]  It's very...
[01:23:34.921 --> 01:23:39.122]  Very, very hard to morally invest, but I was just saying, look at BlackRock.
[01:23:39.563 --> 01:23:45.865]  You can pick and choose what you do there and say, I'm not going to invest in SEGs, which again, are UN controls over businesses.
[01:23:46.865 --> 01:23:54.127]  So in a way, you know, it's like asking cops, cops don't quit the force, even though it's corrupt, even though Democrats run it, because they're gonna put bad people in.
[01:23:54.147 --> 01:23:59.269]  So I'm saying like, for those that are in it, just try to invest as best you can against the globalists.
[01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:01.330]  But you're not going to make as much money.
[01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:03.673]  I mean, if you go with Satan, you're going to do better.
[01:24:04.373 --> 01:24:08.157]  So it's a very sophisticated question about the right way to do it.
[01:24:08.197 --> 01:24:14.063]  And because it's so crazy, I decided not to invest in the stock market, even though I would have done quite well.
[01:24:14.463 --> 01:24:17.426]  And I've told people and others what I thought was the best bets.
[01:24:17.466 --> 01:24:18.907]  They've almost always turned out to be accurate.
[01:24:19.428 --> 01:24:21.270]  But a lot of that is I know so many people.
[01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:26.771]  That it can be called insider trading, what I know.
[01:24:26.831 --> 01:24:29.451]  But Congress, they're allowed to insider trade.
[01:24:29.471 --> 01:24:30.071]  Does that make sense?
[01:24:31.732 --> 01:24:32.572]  Yes, sir, it does.
[01:24:32.612 --> 01:24:39.833]  This is why I asked the question, because I wanted to morally and ethically give my future clients the proper advice.
[01:24:40.393 --> 01:24:50.955]  Because while yes, there are some companies out there that do make a whole lot of money through the stock market, they may not be morally or ethically appropriate.
[01:24:51.135 --> 01:25:09.020]  Well, I think as an advisor, you tell them, you can invest with this, and this is where you'll make more money, or you can bet on things that are promoting humanity, and I would guess spiritually, this is how it works, if they're diversified with more independent liberty companies, they're going to end up making more money in the end.
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:13.101]  There's always the safe bet, 10% a year or whatever, with BlackRock or whatever.
[01:25:13.601 --> 01:25:20.766]  But if people actually did real research and went out and found smaller companies and things that spread things out, I would predict they'd do better.
[01:25:20.786 --> 01:25:27.491]  But I'm not giving that advice out because all I can do is learn the news and know what's going on there.
[01:25:27.511 --> 01:25:30.853]  If I try to just focus on stocks, it would take my life over.
[01:25:30.893 --> 01:25:32.655]  But it's a very complex issue.
[01:25:34.434 --> 01:25:35.095]  That's about right.
[01:25:35.395 --> 01:25:35.915]  Thank you, sir.
[01:25:36.155 --> 01:25:36.516]  Thank you.
[01:25:36.856 --> 01:25:38.057]  I'm sure everybody saw last week.
[01:25:38.077 --> 01:25:38.758]  We never played the clip.
[01:25:38.798 --> 01:25:39.318]  We should have.
[01:25:40.039 --> 01:25:43.882]  Warren Buffett had his yearly meeting, and there was thousands of shareholders there.
[01:25:43.902 --> 01:25:49.046]  And one of their major shareholders gets up, very successful company, rich guy himself.
[01:25:49.106 --> 01:25:52.749]  And he says, hey, what about you and Jeffrey Epstein and the Jeffrey Epstein's Island?
[01:25:52.770 --> 01:25:53.450]  Bill Gates is here.
[01:25:53.670 --> 01:25:54.311]  They had him arrested.
[01:25:56.289 --> 01:25:59.791]  So, that guy owns a big piece of Berkshire Hathaway.
[01:26:00.191 --> 01:26:03.793]  He's not bad, he's invested in that, and he's morally there challenging it.
[01:26:03.854 --> 01:26:09.837]  So, you can either invest in evil companies and try to change them because you're inside of them, or you can not invest.
[01:26:09.917 --> 01:26:18.942]  But, it's a whole universe that is so big that I can't sit here and lie to you and say I know what to do, because it's just not my bailiwick.
[01:26:19.583 --> 01:26:20.183]  Thank you, Jordan.
[01:26:21.684 --> 01:26:23.065]  I would invest in being close to God.
[01:26:23.385 --> 01:26:24.365]  I would invest in praying.
[01:26:24.385 --> 01:26:25.786]  I would invest in family.
[01:26:25.806 --> 01:26:26.987]  I would invest in relationships.
[01:26:27.447 --> 01:26:28.607]  I would invest in your personal health.
[01:26:28.647 --> 01:26:29.308]  Not that I'm perfect.
[01:26:29.388 --> 01:26:30.268]  I just know that's a thing to do.
[01:26:31.128 --> 01:26:37.791]  And then I would invest in being as frugal as possible, not being in debt, and just getting right with God.
[01:26:37.811 --> 01:26:38.812]  I think that's the most important.
[01:26:38.852 --> 01:26:39.512]  And self-defense.
[01:26:40.412 --> 01:26:41.533]  I would invest in guns and ammo.
[01:26:42.353 --> 01:26:43.314]  Patrick in Alabama.
[01:26:43.334 --> 01:26:43.814]  You're on the air.
[01:26:43.854 --> 01:26:44.094]  Go ahead.
[01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:56.720]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to recognize anybody that might have lost a loved one or family member to COVID or the vaccine and we lost our dad in January.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:59.002]  Hold on, I don't want to cut you off and I apologize.
[01:26:59.042 --> 01:26:59.923]  Don't hang up Patrick.
[01:27:00.403 --> 01:27:01.164]  I didn't look at the clock.
[01:27:01.184 --> 01:27:02.004]  We only had a minute left.
[01:27:02.064 --> 01:27:03.986]  I'm going to come right back to you ahead of Mike Leon.
[01:27:04.006 --> 01:27:34.521]   I'm going to give you the full five minutes because just this weekend I was praying Saturday evening before I went to bed, on my knees, for about 30 minutes, and God said to me, the Holy Spirit said, conservatives and Christians are not victims, we're overcomers, but we don't make a big enough deal about how many people we lost, and what the enemy did to us, and that we're the victims of a bio-attack, and the victims of a bio-attack through a shot, and a chemical attack.
[01:27:35.367 --> 01:27:40.250]  And that we really should get people out there to know that we're veterans of a biological war.
[01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:41.711]  Every man, woman, child in the world.
[01:27:42.592 --> 01:27:46.454]  And that the people that did this are going to do it again, and they're getting ready to do it again.
[01:27:46.995 --> 01:27:48.335]  That was really laid on my heart.
[01:27:48.736 --> 01:27:52.358]  That we should remember those, and really talk about those that were murdered.
[01:27:52.638 --> 01:27:53.639]  God put that on my heart.
[01:27:54.559 --> 01:27:58.822]  Michael Yon from El Paso, the collapsed border, joins us in T-minus six minutes.
[01:27:59.362 --> 01:28:08.415]   But I'll give Patrick in Alabama the floor here, because literally, I was praying Saturday evening, And God said, "They're getting a new bio attack ready.
[01:28:08.415 --> 01:28:12.616]   You need to talk about the victims and focus on this or they're going to do it again.
[01:28:12.616 --> 01:28:16.616]   I know that you guys don't want to be victims and don't want to be whining about all they
[01:28:16.616 --> 01:28:19.776]   killed, but you've got to make it a big issue or they're going to kill more.
[01:28:19.776 --> 01:28:23.615]   We've got to remember those that died and stay on the COVID issue."
[01:28:23.615 --> 01:28:24.895]  That was really late in my heart.
[01:28:24.895 --> 01:28:27.016]  So you called in on that exact issue, Patrick.
[01:28:27.016 --> 01:28:29.016]  In fact, I intended to do that today.
[01:28:29.012 --> 01:28:30.272]  I covered a lot of COVID today.
[01:28:30.312 --> 01:28:31.493]  I've been covered in the last few weeks.
[01:28:31.873 --> 01:28:33.473]  So you got the floor in the next four minutes.
[01:28:33.913 --> 01:28:37.534]  Tell us about remembering those that died in this bio warfare.
[01:28:39.094 --> 01:28:39.554]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:39.874 --> 01:28:43.875]  Um, I want to recognize anybody that's a family member, a loved one.
[01:28:44.235 --> 01:28:46.695]  We, uh, I have a brother that was 16.
[01:28:46.855 --> 01:28:47.836]  I was 25.
[01:28:48.216 --> 01:28:54.937]  My sister was 18 and we got an older sister that was 28 and our deaths have come to COVID in January.
[01:28:55.453 --> 01:28:56.374]  Well, I'm so sorry.
[01:28:56.194 --> 01:28:59.334]  before the vaccines were even available.
[01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:04.234]   And, you know, granted he was really sick and he needed some relief,
[01:29:04.234 --> 01:29:06.994]  but this is before I even listened to your show.
[01:29:06.994 --> 01:29:13.514]   But we look, we're from a small town, so the ICU was packed.
[01:29:13.514 --> 01:29:17.233]   So they moved him down to Tallahassee, and over the course of 30 days, he just,
[01:29:17.233 --> 01:29:20.014]  you know, he never got any better.
[01:29:20.014 --> 01:29:22.553]   But I wanna say the hospital, just so this doesn't happen to anybody else.
[01:29:22.553 --> 01:29:24.673]  Well, I'm so sorry, so he died?
[01:29:26.069 --> 01:29:26.510]  He died.
[01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:28.331]  He was a 26-year veteran in the Army.
[01:29:28.351 --> 01:29:30.352]  He was 160th Special Operations Regiment.
[01:29:30.452 --> 01:29:31.613]  Did some super spook stuff.
[01:29:31.633 --> 01:29:32.433]  He was 54.
[01:29:33.133 --> 01:29:33.694]  He was healthy.
[01:29:34.594 --> 01:29:38.076]  So the hospital, I mean, they called us like the first night.
[01:29:38.116 --> 01:29:38.997]  My dad wasn't married.
[01:29:39.037 --> 01:29:46.641]  He didn't have a will or DNR or anything, so we did have to make some tough decisions, but they called us the first time and suggested we put him on Remdesivir.
[01:29:46.682 --> 01:29:48.383]  I never heard of it, so I said yes.
[01:29:48.423 --> 01:29:52.305]  For those who don't know, Remdesivir literally does nothing for you and turns your organs off.
[01:29:53.610 --> 01:30:12.726]  It did, and you know, his lungs, I think the ventilator, I didn't know the ventilator was coin flip either, when you know, life or death, and his lungs turned to glass, his kidneys had shut down, they tried two forms of dialysis, neither of them worked, and you know, if there would have been any quality of life possible... And whether you lived in Australia or Germany or the U.S.
[01:30:12.786 --> 01:30:16.669]  or Canada or anywhere, it was the same policy run by the U.N.
[01:30:17.049 --> 01:30:18.250]  They knew it was a recipe for death.
[01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:19.031]  They killed him.
[01:30:19.111 --> 01:30:20.432]  That's a fact.
[01:30:22.185 --> 01:30:38.430]  And let me say this too, so we were there one time, and it was over Christmas too, so it was a really hard Christmas, and we had this sicko ER nurse just pointing out, and my dad, he's claiming my dad was the sickest, and he's pointing out other people, and he's saying, this person's going to die, this person's going to die, this person's going to die.
[01:30:39.070 --> 01:30:53.571]   And basically, two weeks in, they had this two-by-one meeting, and had the cardiologist, the pulmonologist, the kidney doctor, the hospice, the napkins, the tissues, and all the whole thing, and tried to convince us that Pull the plug right there, but we're a bunch of kids, you know.
[01:30:53.591 --> 01:30:55.372]  We're like, we're not ready to lose our dad.
[01:30:55.392 --> 01:30:55.932]  We're not doing this.
[01:30:55.952 --> 01:30:56.452]  Sorry guys.
[01:30:56.532 --> 01:31:01.134]  And so he went another couple weeks and you know, he just, he just, he was not feeling well.
[01:31:01.174 --> 01:31:06.716]  And all he needed was vitamins and minerals and steroids in his lungs and he would have been fine.
[01:31:07.076 --> 01:31:11.798]  And remember, remember they told people when they came sick to the hospital, go home and wait until it was super bad.
[01:31:11.838 --> 01:31:13.579]  They knew exactly what they were doing.
[01:31:13.859 --> 01:31:16.960]  Cause if you catch it early, 99.9% treatable.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:18.961]  I'm so sorry that happened to you, brother.
[01:31:19.977 --> 01:31:24.358]  This is what I told my siblings, too.
[01:31:24.378 --> 01:31:25.718]  We've been really close together.
[01:31:25.758 --> 01:31:26.898]  We didn't fight over anything.
[01:31:26.978 --> 01:31:28.259]  We didn't fight over money.
[01:31:28.699 --> 01:31:30.199]  We've just gotten closer together.
[01:31:30.359 --> 01:31:33.119]  That's what I told my siblings.
[01:31:33.379 --> 01:31:36.960]  The only way to honor Dad is to be obedient to Christ.
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:38.840]  That's the only way to beat this thing.
[01:31:41.561 --> 01:31:42.201]  That's what we do.
[01:31:42.241 --> 01:31:47.122]  We try to honor God and honor our dad and live up to his expectations and what he would want us to do.
[01:31:49.094 --> 01:31:50.514]  That's really all I wanted to say.
[01:31:51.115 --> 01:32:04.397]  Well brother, inform everyone you know that as soon as they get sick with this and it's not gone, they don't want you to know it's gone, as soon as you, you got to be beefed up on B12 and vitamin D3 and sunlight and water and everything.
[01:32:04.497 --> 01:32:11.299]  And as soon as you get that cough, you got to go on Budesedine, inhalable steroids, everybody should already stockpile it, you can get it easy.
[01:32:11.739 --> 01:32:13.099]  There's all these online sites that do it.
[01:32:13.539 --> 01:32:17.060]  You got to have hydroxychloroquine, you got to have zinc.
[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:23.164]  You've got to have the Ivermectin in it, and if you take it right when you start getting sick, nothing happens.
[01:32:23.684 --> 01:32:26.185]  You don't take it, it will kill your ass.
[01:32:27.446 --> 01:32:29.427]  Yeah, and I'll tell you another thing, too.
[01:32:29.447 --> 01:32:39.233]  You know, I had to exit a job that I was at for three years, because I was the only one in the editorial department that wasn't vaccinated, and they just couldn't quite understand why I wouldn't get vaccinated.
[01:32:39.394 --> 01:32:43.173]   But by that time I'd been listening to your show and Robert Barnes and Peter McCullough
[01:32:43.173 --> 01:32:44.693]  and you know I just really didn't have to do it.
[01:32:44.693 --> 01:32:46.394]  Well God bless you Patrick, we're out of time brother.
[01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:55.394]  [Music]
[01:32:55.394 --> 01:33:02.394]   Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[01:33:02.631 --> 01:33:11.254]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[01:33:11.614 --> 01:33:13.815]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:33:14.475 --> 01:33:17.279]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:25.772]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[01:33:26.292 --> 01:33:30.439]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[01:33:31.099 --> 01:33:42.102]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands-down the best.
[01:33:42.622 --> 01:33:48.163]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[01:33:48.683 --> 01:33:54.845]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:33:56.983 --> 01:34:13.410]  Well, former Special Forces operator, famous investigative journalist for more than 20 years, Michael Yan, who has been on fire more than even usual, joins us from the southwest Texas border in El Paso.
[01:34:13.570 --> 01:34:18.793]  He has another journalist, Anthony Rubin, who's also been a guest on the show, joining us.
[01:34:19.614 --> 01:34:23.354]   Michael yon dot locals comm Michael underscore yon on Twitter
[01:34:23.354 --> 01:34:26.934]   The most hardcore reporting out there and he usually doesn't get upset
[01:34:26.934 --> 01:34:29.614]   But he's beginning really upset because this is broken arrow
[01:34:29.614 --> 01:34:34.134]   This is into the the end of the Republic that we allow this to continue on
[01:34:34.134 --> 01:34:38.534]   I would sure the rest of our crew working with yon knocked it out of the park last week
[01:34:38.534 --> 01:34:43.854]   We dominated coverage takes a lister's boosting the info tens of millions of years. I know Congress has seen it
[01:34:43.854 --> 01:34:49.894]   I know it's been put out Trump seen it It was on Fox News great job crew great job Michael yon so
[01:34:49.894 --> 01:34:54.293]   Michael I could ask you a lot of questions But you really are the tip of the spear on this
[01:34:54.293 --> 01:34:57.894]   I'm gonna try to let you direct where we go you've got the floor there with your guests
[01:34:57.894 --> 01:35:03.883]   Thank you sir This is Anthony Rubin, Muckraker.
[01:35:03.963 --> 01:35:05.485]  We were down in Darien recently.
[01:35:06.025 --> 01:35:08.187]  Darien Gap, as you know Darien Gap very well.
[01:35:08.227 --> 01:35:09.928]  We've talked about it before numerous times.
[01:35:10.549 --> 01:35:12.510]  And he saw what's going on down there.
[01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:13.991]  Now we've been hitting this border here.
[01:35:14.292 --> 01:35:23.019]  We got rocks thrown at us last night actually while right at the border, while Border Patrol was taking in some people to be released in the United States.
[01:35:23.459 --> 01:35:26.742]  But we just got a message about 25 minutes ago from Darien Gap.
[01:35:27.323 --> 01:35:28.889]  Down in a place called Bajo Chiquito.
[01:35:28.929 --> 01:35:30.094]  It's one of the remote villages.
[01:35:30.455 --> 01:35:34.411]   It's the one of the main villages where Uh, where the aliens come in from.
[01:35:34.971 --> 01:35:38.033]  And the person who sent me the message is someone that I know quite well.
[01:35:38.074 --> 01:35:40.095]  We've been to Darien Gap many times together.
[01:35:40.115 --> 01:35:43.798]  Uh, and, uh, he said Darien Gap is being overwhelmed right now.
[01:35:43.838 --> 01:35:47.321]  We've never seen this many people before, ever, in Darien Gap.
[01:35:47.801 --> 01:35:54.547]  So that flashed bang on the decision on Title 42 and whatnot is doing exactly as predicted, uh, increasing the flow.
[01:35:54.967 --> 01:36:00.772]  Now, about 160 people apparently have died in about the last three or four days in the Darien Gap.
[01:36:01.252 --> 01:36:14.440]  From the flash floods, and they just, yesterday, my friend down there, Matt, made video, actually Amy Holton made video of a CH-47, a Chinook was flying over.
[01:36:14.861 --> 01:36:21.185]  We think it was probably going out there to pick up bodies, but we don't know, because you don't really see CH-47s out there much.
[01:36:21.565 --> 01:36:22.646]  I've never seen one out there.
[01:36:23.366 --> 01:36:27.869]  But that, we see Blackhawks sometimes, and the Blackhawks are always American Blackhawks.
[01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:30.771]  I don't believe Panama owns any Chinooks.
[01:36:31.692 --> 01:36:33.133]  They don't own any Blackhawks.
[01:36:33.673 --> 01:36:42.800]  And so, bottom line is, it's very clear that all the things that have happened here with the decisions and all the media and whatnot is doing exactly as predicted.
[01:36:43.201 --> 01:36:49.465]  Right now, by the way, the flows across this border for roughly about the last four days have been actually decreased.
[01:36:49.485 --> 01:36:50.266]  They haven't stopped.
[01:36:50.286 --> 01:36:50.987]  They're still going.
[01:36:51.607 --> 01:36:53.669]  And that's key just to fill listeners in.
[01:36:54.389 --> 01:36:57.051]  Mallorca says the surge is over even though it's record levels.
[01:36:57.531 --> 01:36:59.852]  First they said there was no surge, now they say the surge is over.
[01:37:00.212 --> 01:37:09.537]  You're saying from your sources down on the South American, Central American border of Colombia and Guatemala or Panama that it's just surging.
[01:37:11.198 --> 01:37:12.059]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[01:37:12.539 --> 01:37:14.620]  I mean that's just came in like 30 minutes ago.
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:19.663]  Literally just got the message just before we start doing the test to come on your show Alex.
[01:37:20.183 --> 01:37:22.569]   So I mean it's clearly Impacting.
[01:37:22.589 --> 01:37:28.451]  I just talked with about 10 congressmen this morning about some want to go back down to Darien with me.
[01:37:29.772 --> 01:37:31.592]  Jordan Peterson wants to go down there with me.
[01:37:31.632 --> 01:37:33.673]  Different people like that want to go down there and see it.
[01:37:34.073 --> 01:37:35.654]  It's clearly being overwhelmed.
[01:37:35.994 --> 01:37:37.674]  The Panamanian government is frantic.
[01:37:37.955 --> 01:37:39.615]  They're being destabilized by this.
[01:37:40.055 --> 01:37:42.956]  At least 11% of Panama is now Venezuelans.
[01:37:43.276 --> 01:37:44.917]  That doesn't include Colombians and others.
[01:37:45.297 --> 01:37:49.322]  I mean, it's really causing a lot of angst down in Panama right now.
[01:37:49.382 --> 01:38:01.717]  And we know two weeks ago, the Guatemalan president, because that's northern Central America, the next big step, tried to call Biden and tried to call Kamala and give them emergency warning.
[01:38:02.017 --> 01:38:03.139]  They wouldn't even talk to him.
[01:38:05.103 --> 01:38:06.884]  You know, maybe I should fly down to Guatemala.
[01:38:06.904 --> 01:38:09.086]  I was just thinking about that about 15 minutes ago.
[01:38:10.007 --> 01:38:11.508]  Maybe I'll fly down there and see her.
[01:38:11.948 --> 01:38:29.202]  Apparently, I was just told by Antonio Aguero, who's a border reporter down here in the El Paso area, that the almost president of Guatemala has been really attacking Soros, which you've done for years, saying that, you know, he's the one that's been funding all this.
[01:38:29.242 --> 01:38:30.023]  We know he has.
[01:38:30.903 --> 01:38:32.985]  Uh, you know, you've known for years.
[01:38:33.005 --> 01:38:34.226]  You've been talking about it forever.
[01:38:34.707 --> 01:38:36.228]  And now it's all coming to pass.
[01:38:36.668 --> 01:38:43.034]  It's very clear that what we've seen so far at the worst day of the border is nothing compared to what's building right now.
[01:38:43.434 --> 01:38:46.557]  It's very clear that we're, uh, well, it's already, there's no border.
[01:38:46.917 --> 01:38:53.281]   And by the way, the Texas National Guard and whatnot, who's Active duty and everybody else is filling these hotels like this hotel.
[01:38:53.621 --> 01:39:01.023]  We punched out to you to get signal so we could come on with you They I mean these are basically like a virtual army base.
[01:39:01.083 --> 01:39:08.325]  You know what I mean, but they are facilitating the crossing It's not like Texas National Guard or the army or anybody else or a border patrol.
[01:39:08.585 --> 01:39:26.025]   They are not stopping it You know, I was just talking with I was doing another interview this morning and I said, you know, I lived in Germany for four years I've read a lot of history about World War two and you often wonder if When Germans would say, we didn't know what was happening at Dachau, we didn't know what was happening here or there, Treblinka.
[01:39:26.725 --> 01:39:32.569]  But now, and that was Poland of course, but now I can see how people don't know.
[01:39:32.609 --> 01:39:35.772]  Like when you go to Del Rio or you go here, El Paso.
[01:39:36.552 --> 01:40:05.401]   Brownsville there's people right by the border have no idea that we're being invaded with millions of people and we see the National Guard last night was harassing us actually there was coyotes last night and on ATVs right at the border and the Border Patrol I mean I'm sorry the National Guard turned their lights on us not them and we had already been there tonight they know who we were and whatnot instead of lighting up the coyotes they lit us on They lit us up in front of the coyotes.
[01:40:05.722 --> 01:40:07.043]  You can't even make up this stuff.
[01:40:08.464 --> 01:40:12.226]  Let me elaborate on that, because you're a veteran yourself, Army Special Operations.
[01:40:13.547 --> 01:40:28.998]  Owen was down there with you for four days, and they were very polite to the National Guard and the State Guard, and we know that one of our security guys is an Army veteran, he was also in the State Guard, and they were getting in my guy's face, so he went over, we'll play the clip now.
[01:40:29.998 --> 01:40:32.961]  You were there and just said, what is your problem?
[01:40:33.001 --> 01:40:34.222]  You were given an order by Abbott.
[01:40:34.262 --> 01:40:34.882]  It was not perfect.
[01:40:34.922 --> 01:40:35.363]  We know that.
[01:40:35.683 --> 01:40:38.585]  But Abbott said, go stop the illegal invasion.
[01:40:38.886 --> 01:40:40.667]  Now, maybe Abbott secretly told him don't do it.
[01:40:40.947 --> 01:40:44.811]  But there they are under NGO Biden command, not following the state orders.
[01:40:45.151 --> 01:40:45.931]  Here's that clip.
[01:40:46.032 --> 01:40:47.092]  I want to get your response to it.
[01:40:47.112 --> 01:40:47.433]  Here it is.
[01:40:51.442 --> 01:40:51.902]  Who is your chief?
[01:40:51.721 --> 01:41:01.721]  [INAUDIBLE]
[01:41:01.721 --> 01:41:11.721]  [INAUDIBLE]
[01:41:11.721 --> 01:41:12.721]  He is your chief.
[01:41:12.721 --> 01:41:12.721]  Your commander in chief.
[01:41:12.721 --> 01:41:14.721]  He is your chief.
[01:41:14.721 --> 01:41:16.721]  Your commander in chief.
[01:41:15.877 --> 01:41:17.299]  You can roll your eyes out and help.
[01:41:17.319 --> 01:41:18.140]  I'm not rolling my eyes.
[01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:22.907]  But you guys don't understand because you guys are in full active duty to help us with what an order is.
[01:41:22.947 --> 01:41:23.628]  Alright, so we're...
[01:41:24.838 --> 01:41:25.438]  No, no, no, no.
[01:41:25.458 --> 01:41:26.778]  I'm not saying anything.
[01:41:26.839 --> 01:41:30.539]  Listen, man, I'm not in the fucking mood, so you shouldn't be talking to me about that.
[01:41:30.559 --> 01:41:30.959]  No, no, partner.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.460]  What you need to do is follow the orders the governor set forth.
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:36.201]  That's what you need to do, because that's your job at Texas A&M University.
[01:41:36.221 --> 01:41:37.581]  You're not wearing a uniform, dude.
[01:41:37.621 --> 01:41:38.841]  I already did my job.
[01:41:38.941 --> 01:41:39.882]  And I'm doing mine.
[01:41:40.102 --> 01:41:40.302]  Right.
[01:41:40.362 --> 01:41:43.022]  To follow the orders of the governor, but you guys haven't done.
[01:41:43.102 --> 01:41:44.023]  You guys are good.
[01:41:44.043 --> 01:41:45.363]  You're just facilitating buses.
[01:41:45.403 --> 01:41:50.284]  The governor said in order to slow down the influx of illegal immigrants.
[01:41:50.304 --> 01:41:51.264]  You guys aren't doing that.
[01:41:51.604 --> 01:41:53.425]  Where's your pride in following orders, man?
[01:41:54.325 --> 01:41:54.906]  Come on, man.
[01:41:54.946 --> 01:41:57.768]  You're wearing a uniform to say and represent the state of Texas.
[01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:59.170]  Not Border Patrol.
[01:41:59.570 --> 01:42:00.891]  Have some pride, gentlemen.
[01:42:01.271 --> 01:42:02.292]  The governor spoke.
[01:42:02.392 --> 01:42:03.533]  You need to follow those orders.
[01:42:03.553 --> 01:42:05.335]  Thank you.
[01:42:05.415 --> 01:42:12.321]  So, Michael Young, people that don't know how federalism works, federal police, federal military, state military, you were there.
[01:42:12.341 --> 01:42:13.682]  I know you were with the crew.
[01:42:13.702 --> 01:42:15.163]  I didn't know you were there when this happened.
[01:42:15.664 --> 01:42:17.966]  What is your view of this interaction and what do you think is really going on?
[01:42:19.261 --> 01:42:21.242]  Oh yeah, I have a lot to say about that.
[01:42:21.302 --> 01:42:24.284]  That's Dom that was making, on the left hand, his name's Dom.
[01:42:24.604 --> 01:42:25.605]  He's a former Marine.
[01:42:25.785 --> 01:42:27.726]  He did embassy security, right?
[01:42:28.026 --> 01:42:29.827]  He was right on target with what he was saying.
[01:42:30.107 --> 01:42:31.728]  He's a very steady individual, right?
[01:42:32.208 --> 01:42:37.551]  And that guy that he's talking to, without rank and without, he didn't have his name tag on him.
[01:42:37.972 --> 01:42:40.153]  His name, we looked him up, we found him.
[01:42:40.453 --> 01:42:42.854]  His name is Staff Sergeant Michael DiCarlo.
[01:42:43.155 --> 01:42:47.257]  He's the retention NCO at Hill Country and the Texas National Guard.
[01:42:47.857 --> 01:42:57.448]  That guy, Michael DiCarlo, later that night, he actually hit Antonio Aguero with his vehicle.
[01:42:57.588 --> 01:42:58.009]  I saw it.
[01:42:58.049 --> 01:42:58.609]  He bumped him.
[01:42:58.629 --> 01:42:59.710]  He just, like, bumped him.
[01:43:00.091 --> 01:43:03.174]  And another reporter, I don't know his name, but I was there.
[01:43:03.214 --> 01:43:06.398]  I was physically present, like, feet away, and I was making video, right?
[01:43:06.818 --> 01:43:09.979]  I had to move a state senator out of the way so she didn't get hit.
[01:43:10.279 --> 01:43:13.700]  Her name is Tammy Nichols from Idaho.
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:14.760]  She was down here.
[01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:30.185]   I was talking with Tammy Nichols, Senator Tammy Nichols, when that guy that Dom the Marine is talking to, the one that said we're a bunch of, I don't know, idiots or whatever he said, that guy, his name is Staff Sergeant Michael DiCarlo.
[01:43:30.205 --> 01:43:30.825]  Something's wrong.
[01:43:30.845 --> 01:43:32.007]  You should've seen the affect on his face.
[01:43:31.887 --> 01:43:35.326]   I didn't know that was the same guy almost running over a state senator.
[01:43:35.326 --> 01:43:36.327]  Is this guy a wolkster?
[01:43:36.327 --> 01:43:41.447]   I mean, why is he, like you said, why is he so aggressive towards Americans?
[01:43:41.447 --> 01:43:42.447]  Something's wrong.
[01:43:42.447 --> 01:43:44.087]  You should have seen the affect on his face.
[01:43:44.087 --> 01:43:49.287]   I thought he appeared to be, I'm not going to say something that's going to get me in
[01:43:49.287 --> 01:43:52.086]   legal trouble, but he didn't look like he was in the right frame of mind.
[01:43:52.303 --> 01:43:57.766]  So we called law enforcement and we said, hey, look, he looks like he may be under the influence of something.
[01:43:58.146 --> 01:44:01.207]  He needs to be, you know, this is, that was a fault of the deputy.
[01:44:01.227 --> 01:44:02.468]  He needs to be relieved of command.
[01:44:04.093 --> 01:44:05.574]  Oh, he would not.
[01:44:05.654 --> 01:44:08.296]  In fact, I've got the things I'm telling you now I have on video.
[01:44:08.476 --> 01:44:10.118]  I have on video like five feet away.
[01:44:10.518 --> 01:44:11.959]  So the law enforcement showed up.
[01:44:12.019 --> 01:44:18.144]  We had asked for a supervisor or actually I asked for the commander and the Michael DiCarlo staff sergeant.
[01:44:18.604 --> 01:44:19.705]  You know, we found his name later.
[01:44:19.725 --> 01:44:20.646]  He wouldn't give us his name.
[01:44:20.926 --> 01:44:22.687]  We found his name in like five minutes, of course.
[01:44:22.707 --> 01:44:23.768]  This is the age of the Internet.
[01:44:24.288 --> 01:44:27.109]  And, uh, and, uh, would not call us commanding officer.
[01:44:27.149 --> 01:44:29.790]  In any case, right on my video, he said, they're not going to do anything.
[01:44:30.131 --> 01:44:33.672]  I'll just, I'll send you the video and you can, you can make a clip of it yourself.
[01:44:34.032 --> 01:44:35.733]  I mean, and then law enforcement shows up.
[01:44:36.033 --> 01:44:36.673]  I mean, look at him.
[01:44:36.693 --> 01:44:38.194]  He looks like he's whacked out of his brain.
[01:44:39.174 --> 01:44:39.995]  I made that video.
[01:44:40.175 --> 01:44:41.335]  That's my video right there.
[01:44:41.515 --> 01:44:41.715]  Yeah.
[01:44:42.256 --> 01:44:43.036]  I'll give you the whole thing.
[01:44:43.056 --> 01:44:45.097]  We're going to play the audio in a minute.
[01:44:45.357 --> 01:44:47.698]  Guys, get it ready with audio, but tell us, Michael, what happened.
[01:44:49.039 --> 01:44:55.722]  Oh, so later the public affairs guy comes up and starts congratulating him when he got out of the vehicle later.
[01:44:55.782 --> 01:44:56.523]  I got it on video.
[01:44:56.723 --> 01:45:01.545]  I've got it on video when the public affairs guy comes up and congratulates him for what he did right there.
[01:45:01.565 --> 01:45:08.469]  So the bottom line is they're bringing in a woke military that is literally cheerleaders for this invasion and he's ignoring the governor's orders.
[01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.530]  Yep.
[01:45:10.931 --> 01:45:12.992]  So we're seeing that over and over and over.
[01:45:13.012 --> 01:45:15.054]  He's Texas National Guard.
[01:45:15.094 --> 01:45:20.939]  Last night it was Puerto Rican National Guard on the New Mexico side lighting us up instead of lighting up the coyotes.
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:22.040]  It was unbelievable.
[01:45:22.401 --> 01:45:23.121]  They knew who we were.
[01:45:23.141 --> 01:45:24.222]  It was our second night there.
[01:45:24.242 --> 01:45:31.869]  By the way, liberals always make jokes when we're talking about coyotes like they're a smaller version of a wolf.
[01:45:32.209 --> 01:45:34.691]  We're not talking about the canine coyote.
[01:45:35.012 --> 01:45:37.294]  For folks who don't know, Michael Yawn, explain what a coyote is.
[01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:40.982]  Coyotes are the ones who help people.
[01:45:41.102 --> 01:45:43.323]  They could have been drug smugglers.
[01:45:43.343 --> 01:45:44.184]  They could have been coyotes.
[01:45:44.224 --> 01:45:47.707]  Coyotes are the ones who help funnel aliens across the border.
[01:45:47.967 --> 01:45:52.610]  And by the way, four people have been found dead in that area in about the last week.
[01:45:52.931 --> 01:45:56.994]  It's not in the news much, but it was in the news, and I asked the Border Patrol about it last night.
[01:45:57.354 --> 01:46:03.799]  They said, yeah, there were, but don't know who they were, don't know what happened, but it's just normal along the border to find bodies.
[01:46:03.819 --> 01:46:04.419]  You know how that is.
[01:46:04.439 --> 01:46:05.240]  You've come down here, too.
[01:46:07.363 --> 01:46:10.632]  Well, I got a thousand questions to ask, but I skipped the break.
[01:46:11.033 --> 01:46:14.924]  Continue on, introduce Anthony Rubin to us, keep giving us your intel.
[01:46:16.946 --> 01:46:20.189]  Yeah, I mean, so it's clear that we're being overwhelmed.
[01:46:20.609 --> 01:46:22.611]  The invasion is facilitated.
[01:46:22.951 --> 01:46:24.613]  Texas Governor Abbott is part of it.
[01:46:25.073 --> 01:46:30.037]  He's basically the World Economic Forum appointee for the Texas sector of the invasion.
[01:46:30.057 --> 01:46:33.741]  I mean, he's not really the governor of Texas in the sense that we would look at that.
[01:46:34.101 --> 01:46:35.582]  He's on their website.
[01:46:35.942 --> 01:46:39.806]  Governor Greg Abbott is on the World Economic Forum website.
[01:46:40.326 --> 01:46:46.108]  And, again, you see, again, let's go back to Nazi days and World War II.
[01:46:46.368 --> 01:46:53.670]  After the war is over, we all wonder, you know, because I'm reading history books, as have you, how did anybody not know what was happening?
[01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:55.330]  Or how, why did they do this?
[01:46:55.610 --> 01:46:57.131]  Why did they help operate trains?
[01:46:57.531 --> 01:46:58.951]  Why did they help operate the camps?
[01:46:59.251 --> 01:47:00.351]  Well, that's what we're seeing now.
[01:47:00.672 --> 01:47:05.093]   They're clearly operating The train of migration which is massive.
[01:47:05.413 --> 01:47:06.453]  I mean it's an invasion.
[01:47:06.613 --> 01:47:10.194]  Millions of people have already come and millions more are coming.
[01:47:10.334 --> 01:47:10.794]  Millions.
[01:47:11.174 --> 01:47:13.895]  I mean we're being overwhelmed even while our economy collapses.
[01:47:14.235 --> 01:47:19.357]  We've got people down here on downtown streets of El Paso getting into fights.
[01:47:19.497 --> 01:47:20.537]  We're talking about the aliens.
[01:47:21.117 --> 01:47:24.638]  We've got aliens saying they're being sent to specific parts of the United States.
[01:47:25.018 --> 01:47:37.027]  Mike, Chicago, you saw those black Americans the other day saying that their district is being overwhelmed with aliens, which are overwhelming their, you know, basically going to turn their voting district.
[01:47:38.283 --> 01:47:41.565]  The question is now, are they being targeted to exactly where they're going?
[01:47:41.625 --> 01:47:46.649]  We know that some of the aliens have told us that they're being given instructions to go to certain places.
[01:47:47.349 --> 01:47:49.451]  Michael, that's my next big question.
[01:47:49.491 --> 01:47:50.652]  Everything you bring up is so huge.
[01:47:51.152 --> 01:47:54.935]  The $67 trillion question is, where are they all going?
[01:47:54.975 --> 01:47:56.596]  We see them all over the place in Texas.
[01:47:57.136 --> 01:48:01.779]  But they're showing up in Maine, they're showing up in Massachusetts, they're showing up in Chicago.
[01:48:02.759 --> 01:48:03.900]  You name it, they're showing up.
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:08.302]  And since you mentioned it, let me play a clip of South Shore, Chicago.
[01:48:08.902 --> 01:48:12.885]  Voters for Biden by a whopping 97%.
[01:48:14.365 --> 01:48:16.507]  And the residents say they don't want illegal aliens there.
[01:48:16.887 --> 01:48:18.148]  What did they think they were voting for?
[01:48:18.188 --> 01:48:18.648]  Here's a clip.
[01:48:19.722 --> 01:48:22.483]  resources that have not come to us.
[01:48:22.483 --> 01:48:27.802]   Now you want to overly compensate for people who've never lived here before.
[01:48:27.802 --> 01:48:34.443]   And they need to be taken care of first and foremost before anything else happens here.
[01:48:34.443 --> 01:48:35.342]  Yes.
[01:48:35.342 --> 01:48:40.363]   Why would any leader put our black communities already riddled with
[01:48:40.363 --> 01:48:46.842]   crime at further risk by placing unvetted non-taxpayers steps away
[01:48:46.842 --> 01:48:54.082]   from our seniors, our children and our homes we've worked so hard on our own to secure.
[01:48:54.082 --> 01:48:56.082]  Beautiful. Beautiful.
[01:48:55.683 --> 01:48:56.784]  We are at war, people.
[01:48:58.085 --> 01:48:59.646]  Our communities are at war.
[01:49:00.603 --> 01:49:15.476]  They are violating our communities, and we're asking that we have, across the country, we're asking and we're demanding for officers of Black America, or whatever you want to call it, to deal with issues like this!
[01:49:15.756 --> 01:49:19.639]  I did get placed on a wait list, but I was told that the immigrants were taking priority.
[01:49:19.759 --> 01:49:25.064]  That's a story that a lot of people don't know, and it just, it hurt me.
[01:49:25.084 --> 01:49:26.205]  I'm like, oh, wait a minute.
[01:49:26.965 --> 01:49:35.697]   I understand we need to be humanitarian, But these people are, that my participants, are third and fourth generation Chicagoans.
[01:49:36.257 --> 01:49:38.119]  Born, bred, fed, and raised here.
[01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:46.547]  My grandmother, Mary Ellen Carrington, rest in peace, always said, Craig, charity starts at home first, and then it goes abroad.
[01:49:47.948 --> 01:49:53.113]  Politically, having over 500 people in our community would completely wipe out any interest we have.
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:50:00.004]  Many of these migrants have been dumped in our neighborhoods without a plan in place.
[01:50:00.244 --> 01:50:01.425]  That's right, so that's enough.
[01:50:02.025 --> 01:50:04.527]  So it's not 500 migrants, sweetheart.
[01:50:04.667 --> 01:50:06.669]  It's probably 100,000 in Chicago.
[01:50:07.089 --> 01:50:12.212]  We're talking three Chicago's a year being brought in with phones to be controlled.
[01:50:14.614 --> 01:50:17.335]  Veteran and intelligence officer can explain why that's so big.
[01:50:17.695 --> 01:50:18.795]  This is an organized takeover.
[01:50:18.815 --> 01:50:20.175]  We're not against the illegals being brought in.
[01:50:20.195 --> 01:50:22.656]  They're being used as pawns in this.
[01:50:22.736 --> 01:50:28.217]  But since you mentioned it, Michael, I wanted to raise that video clip just to back up what you're saying.
[01:50:28.237 --> 01:50:30.938]  So the big question is, where are they all going?
[01:50:31.278 --> 01:50:34.379]  How do the phones they're being given factor into this?
[01:50:34.399 --> 01:50:39.520]  All right, he froze.
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:41.821]  The miracle of Skype or Zoom.
[01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:47.884]  We're going to get him reconnected to comment on that, but this is a big, big deal.
[01:50:47.904 --> 01:50:53.488]  You've got the mayor of New York saying, oh my gosh, we've got tens of thousands of illegals, we've got to ship them to the suburbs.
[01:50:53.868 --> 01:50:54.649]  Where do they go?
[01:50:54.729 --> 01:50:55.830]  There's no jobs.
[01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:58.532]  The plan is to bring the country down.
[01:50:58.832 --> 01:51:01.374]  The UN shut these countries down for years.
[01:51:02.395 --> 01:51:03.716]  So they totally collapsed.
[01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:15.089]  I'm not against these people, but they're coming here as a weapon system, as an economic system, as a voting block to take over society and civilization.
[01:51:16.670 --> 01:51:18.091]  We can't operate without your support.
[01:51:18.151 --> 01:51:19.172]  Your word of mouth is king.
[01:51:19.192 --> 01:51:21.054]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:51:21.634 --> 01:51:26.779]  I want to encourage you all to just take action and get great products you need at infowarestore.com.
[01:51:28.885 --> 01:51:29.806]  We have X3.
[01:51:30.286 --> 01:51:31.027]  You've got to take it.
[01:51:31.047 --> 01:51:32.168]  It takes two weeks to kick in.
[01:51:32.668 --> 01:51:33.729]  You need to experience it.
[01:51:33.809 --> 01:51:35.350]  You'll always order it after you do.
[01:51:35.370 --> 01:51:37.372]  10-hour clean energy.
[01:51:37.412 --> 01:51:38.633]  TurboForce back in stock.
[01:51:39.034 --> 01:51:39.794]  Ultimate krill oil.
[01:51:39.914 --> 01:51:40.675]  Ultimate fish oil.
[01:51:41.416 --> 01:51:44.618]  The Alexa Pure water filtration system.
[01:51:44.678 --> 01:51:48.101]  Highest quality water filter for half the cost of leading competitors.
[01:51:48.682 --> 01:51:50.883]  It's all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:51:51.224 --> 01:51:52.925]  We're not backed by George Soros.
[01:51:53.366 --> 01:51:54.987]  We are backed by you.
[01:51:55.027 --> 01:51:59.055]   And Michael Young, And the other reporter he's with are knocking out of the park.
[01:51:59.656 --> 01:52:02.658]  I hope we're able to get him and Anthony Rubin back on.
[01:52:02.678 --> 01:52:03.158]  There they are.
[01:52:03.779 --> 01:52:05.020]  They're reconnecting right now.
[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:08.823]  So, Michael Yon, it doesn't matter if your camera's pointed at the ceiling, it's fine.
[01:52:09.344 --> 01:52:10.224]  I'm going to go to you.
[01:52:11.205 --> 01:52:11.886]  Michael Yon.
[01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:14.260]  Where does this go?
[01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:15.681]  Where are the illegals going?
[01:52:16.141 --> 01:52:17.362]  What is the master plan?
[01:52:17.402 --> 01:52:18.462]  What are the globalists planning?
[01:52:18.902 --> 01:52:19.622]  How do we stop it?
[01:52:19.802 --> 01:52:20.423]  Can you hear me, Michael?
[01:52:20.683 --> 01:52:22.323]  Yeah, we can hear you.
[01:52:22.403 --> 01:52:22.904]  Can you get that?
[01:52:22.924 --> 01:52:23.184]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:52:23.284 --> 01:52:24.084]  Audio doesn't matter.
[01:52:24.224 --> 01:52:24.904]  Video doesn't matter.
[01:52:24.924 --> 01:52:25.805]  Just start talking.
[01:52:25.825 --> 01:52:26.445]  We'll fix it later.
[01:52:26.485 --> 01:52:26.765]  Go ahead.
[01:52:28.027 --> 01:52:34.172]  Okay, I'm going to turn this over to Anthony just a quick, but the phone overheated and we literally got a cup of ice and just put it in.
[01:52:34.192 --> 01:52:34.733]  No, I get it.
[01:52:34.793 --> 01:52:35.313]  That happens.
[01:52:35.333 --> 01:52:36.074]  You're awesome.
[01:52:36.094 --> 01:52:36.434]  We get it.
[01:52:36.474 --> 01:52:37.555]  Incredible technology.
[01:52:39.797 --> 01:52:41.298]  I respect you.
[01:52:41.318 --> 01:52:44.321]  You're a military political mind.
[01:52:45.542 --> 01:52:46.663]  How bad is it going to get?
[01:52:47.343 --> 01:52:48.184]  Where is this going?
[01:52:49.821 --> 01:52:50.241]  Oh, war.
[01:52:50.561 --> 01:52:52.182]  Clearly going into genocide.
[01:52:52.702 --> 01:52:54.023]  I mean, it's utterly clear.
[01:52:54.083 --> 01:52:55.963]  I don't see how it could be any more clear.
[01:52:56.284 --> 01:53:01.826]  I mean, for instance, we were sitting in this lobby last night, and it came on the television right behind me right now.
[01:53:02.106 --> 01:53:05.147]  They were building the white supremacy narrative.
[01:53:05.647 --> 01:53:12.292]  I mean, it's very clear that the ingredients are being built in right now.
[01:53:12.512 --> 01:53:15.094]  And I saw you say that and it go viral five days ago.
[01:53:15.495 --> 01:53:17.436]  Flesh out why you mean genocide.
[01:53:17.956 --> 01:53:19.117]  I totally agree.
[01:53:19.458 --> 01:53:20.478]  Replacement migration.
[01:53:21.059 --> 01:53:21.679]  Civil war.
[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:23.841]  Flesh out what that means.
[01:53:26.457 --> 01:53:29.038]  Well, first of all, we're going to have massive food shortages.
[01:53:29.118 --> 01:53:29.918]  That much is clear.
[01:53:30.038 --> 01:53:30.638]  That's obvious.
[01:53:30.678 --> 01:53:32.159]  I've been mourning about it for three years.
[01:53:32.199 --> 01:53:33.559]  The conditions are building for that.
[01:53:34.579 --> 01:53:37.200]  And we see the tremendous information war.
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:39.661]  I mean, your whole show is called Info Wars.
[01:53:39.981 --> 01:53:41.641]  So no, you don't need the briefing on that.
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:47.100]   Everywhere I go, for instance, down in Columbia, you can see on the television, CNN,
[01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:48.819]  showing people how to get here.
[01:53:48.819 --> 01:53:55.500]   Everywhere you go, whether it's here or Europe or Japan, even, you'll see them building this racism narrative,
[01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:57.140]  white man bad and that sort of thing.
[01:53:57.140 --> 01:54:00.661]  Even in Japan, you got BLM walking down the streets.
[01:54:00.661 --> 01:54:02.420]  I mean, it's quite intense.
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:07.739]   You can see that as we get millions of people brought into the United States,
[01:54:07.739 --> 01:54:11.020]  these camps, Alex, that they're building are huge.
[01:54:10.888 --> 01:54:16.372]  There's one here in Northeast El Paso that's good to go for at least 4,000 people, we think.
[01:54:16.652 --> 01:54:17.533]  They're still building it.
[01:54:17.853 --> 01:54:19.434]  There's other camps that are out for bid.
[01:54:19.494 --> 01:54:21.556]  I know there's camps all over.
[01:54:22.257 --> 01:54:23.538]  You've talked about this many times.
[01:54:23.938 --> 01:54:25.439]  The FEMA camps and the other camps.
[01:54:25.479 --> 01:54:27.120]  We don't even know how many camps there are.
[01:54:27.261 --> 01:54:27.541]  Do you?
[01:54:27.561 --> 01:54:31.063]  I mean, Alex, actually, I'm asking you, how many camps are there?
[01:54:31.264 --> 01:54:34.106]  Because I'm about to lift and shift and do research on just camps.
[01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:37.802]  I have no idea how many camps there are.
[01:54:37.822 --> 01:54:38.643]  It's all kept secret.
[01:54:38.683 --> 01:54:39.925]  They fly them in at 2 a.m.
[01:54:40.446 --> 01:54:45.012]  in Maine, in New York, in Seattle, in Minnesota, in Dallas.
[01:54:45.052 --> 01:54:47.495]  I mean, it's all black-op run.
[01:54:47.555 --> 01:54:48.777]  As you said, it's all organized.
[01:54:48.817 --> 01:54:49.498]  It's all coordinated.
[01:54:50.897 --> 01:54:53.439]  A lot of these camps are like virtual camps, actually.
[01:54:53.459 --> 01:54:54.560]  They're hotels, right?
[01:54:55.020 --> 01:55:06.289]  I mean, for instance, here, this hotel that we're staying in now is a virtual army base, insofar as there's a lot of military here, and there's Homeland Security here, and other people here, and other camp.
[01:55:06.309 --> 01:55:11.693]  There's another hotel a couple doors down that's filled with people who are building one of the camps, and that sort of thing.
[01:55:12.173 --> 01:55:13.674]  So all these hotels are filled with people.
[01:55:13.694 --> 01:55:14.155]  And you make that point.
[01:55:14.175 --> 01:55:16.096]  The phones are key to the whole coordination.
[01:55:16.577 --> 01:55:17.797]  It's beyond the Obama phone.
[01:55:17.837 --> 01:55:18.298]  Explain that.
[01:55:20.237 --> 01:55:24.619]  Oh yeah, with the weaponization, I mean, phones are so easy to weaponize now, for instance.
[01:55:25.079 --> 01:55:34.444]  They can always be tracked in great detail, as you know, who you're with, where you're at, and you can send messages to them, you can send money to them, you can send instructions.
[01:55:34.744 --> 01:55:37.225]  Hey, you go to XYZ, you can get some money, you know?
[01:55:37.545 --> 01:55:41.507]  Show me a picture of a police car burning, you can get ten bucks on your phone, that sort of thing.
[01:55:41.828 --> 01:55:46.450]  I mean, this is the sort of stuff that can be done by CCP, it can be done by other people.
[01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:48.831]  And the AI can program it, the AI can control it.
[01:55:50.117 --> 01:55:57.542]  Oh yeah, yeah, that adds another complete and incredible dimension that the AI could actually direct and be watching.
[01:55:58.203 --> 01:56:01.825]  It can watch, you know, the situation in real time.
[01:56:01.906 --> 01:56:04.647]  And compartmentalize humans that wouldn't even go along with us.
[01:56:04.668 --> 01:56:06.429]  They don't even know what AI sent out as an order.
[01:56:08.206 --> 01:56:09.547]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:56:09.607 --> 01:56:13.350]  They wouldn't have no idea they're even talking with AI or the AI is talking with them.
[01:56:14.131 --> 01:56:17.694]  Keep in mind, the people that are coming in across the border come in different ecosystems.
[01:56:18.094 --> 01:56:20.716]  Some are just, for instance, Venezuelans running from Venezuela.
[01:56:21.777 --> 01:56:24.099]  Others are Colombians running from Colombia, right?
[01:56:24.379 --> 01:56:26.661]  And then we've got the Chinese... Michael Yawn, stay there.
[01:56:26.681 --> 01:56:27.842]  Do one more segment with us.
[01:56:29.063 --> 01:56:30.344]  Your Skype broke up, but it's back.
[01:56:30.364 --> 01:56:31.965]  We'll come right back to you in three minutes.
[01:56:31.985 --> 01:56:32.546]  Stay with us, sir.
[01:56:33.166 --> 01:56:37.410]  Well, the bad news is the new world order is coming down on us like King Kong.
[01:56:38.683 --> 01:56:40.684]  The good news is the fight's out in the open.
[01:56:41.164 --> 01:56:43.245]  You can decide to roll over and die or fight back.
[01:56:43.865 --> 01:56:45.066]  Michael Yan is on fire.
[01:56:45.086 --> 01:56:48.707]  He's got another great investigative journalist who I know about his great work, Anthony Rubin.
[01:56:48.727 --> 01:56:50.988]  He was trying to introduce him but their Skype broke out.
[01:56:51.449 --> 01:56:53.890]  They're down there on the Texas-Mexico border in El Paso.
[01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:56.751]  Michael, finish your point and let's hand the baton to Anthony Rubin.
[01:56:58.450 --> 01:56:58.650]  Right.
[01:56:58.930 --> 01:57:02.933]  I think it is important to go ahead and hand it over to Anthony Rubin from Muckraker.
[01:57:02.993 --> 01:57:06.116]  I took him down to Darien recently and he saw it for himself.
[01:57:06.236 --> 01:57:07.337]  Made a small documentary.
[01:57:07.397 --> 01:57:09.238]  It's very much worth looking at.
[01:57:09.638 --> 01:57:14.162]  In fact, he was there the night we encountered Chai Ninja, the obvious Chinese spy.
[01:57:15.123 --> 01:57:22.727]   And Anthony's the first one to call him out and actually Sure, you could go to muckraker.com or you could find me on Twitter at Real Muckraker.
[01:57:22.747 --> 01:57:24.848]  Sure, well, I mean, let me just lay it out.
[01:57:24.668 --> 01:57:28.027]   I know who you are, a lot of listeners do, but for those that don't, how do we find your
[01:57:28.027 --> 01:57:31.908]  documentaries, how do we find your very dangerous work?
[01:57:31.908 --> 01:57:32.988]  Sure.
[01:57:32.988 --> 01:57:36.788]   You could go to muckraker.com or you could find me on Twitter @RealMuckraker.
[01:57:36.788 --> 01:57:37.788]  All right.
[01:57:37.788 --> 01:57:39.347]  Well, tell us what you've seen.
[01:57:39.347 --> 01:57:40.347]  Sure.
[01:57:40.347 --> 01:57:41.988]  Well, I mean, let me just lay it out.
[01:57:41.988 --> 01:57:46.227]   So first of all, we were in the Daring Gap, like Mikey Gahn said, your listeners have
[01:57:46.227 --> 01:57:48.347]  probably seen a lot of our work already.
[01:57:48.435 --> 01:57:53.658]  I need to express first and foremost the speed with which these people are coming up here, especially the Chinese.
[01:57:53.999 --> 01:57:58.101]  I was in touch with a couple of Chinese people that we met down there in the Darien Gap.
[01:57:58.241 --> 01:58:08.748]  I flew back to California and we were there mid-April and by the end of April, less than two weeks later, I was getting calls from them and they were saying, hey, we're in Los Angeles, we want to meet up with you.
[01:58:09.429 --> 01:58:10.370]  It's happening that quickly.
[01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:12.091]  So I mean, there's people down there right now.
[01:58:12.111 --> 01:58:20.537]  We were actually just getting a report earlier from a fixture of ours who went down to the Daring Gap with who was saying that they're coming into these camps, you know, up to 2500 a day.
[01:58:20.838 --> 01:58:23.740]  And all those people are coming up here and they'll probably be up here in like two weeks.
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:26.462]  So I mean, you know, right now we're in El Paso right now.
[01:58:27.082 --> 01:58:34.948]   And we haven't really been seeing too much action, but for sure, give it another 10 days, you know, two weeks, three weeks, There's going to be another major flash.
[01:58:35.008 --> 01:58:36.408]  It's just getting started for sure.
[01:58:36.628 --> 01:58:37.789]  This is Agenda 2030.
[01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:44.772]  I would point your listeners to a document that I actually point out in my little documentary that you guys have been flashing up.
[01:58:45.253 --> 01:58:46.353]  It's by the IOM.
[01:58:46.413 --> 01:58:48.834]  This is the International Organization of Migration.
[01:58:49.195 --> 01:58:52.296]  They are basically the migration arm of the UN.
[01:58:52.316 --> 01:58:53.056]  They're part of the UN.
[01:58:54.617 --> 01:58:56.819]  They're a big group down there in the Daring Gap.
[01:58:56.839 --> 01:58:57.520]  You see them everywhere.
[01:58:57.680 --> 01:59:00.763]  They're actually the group that hands out those quote-unquote rape kits.
[01:59:00.943 --> 01:59:05.026]  I shouldn't even say quote-unquote, that's what they are, the rape kits with the condoms and the female condoms and the whistles and all that.
[01:59:05.967 --> 01:59:15.475]  But the IOM put out a very important document, which all of your listeners right now need to go and download before it gets blackballed, which is called Migration and the 2030 Agenda.
[01:59:15.495 --> 01:59:18.038]  And it lays it out in that document clear as day.
[01:59:18.138 --> 01:59:20.580]  It calls these migrants agents of development.
[01:59:21.255 --> 01:59:25.977]  And it says that they are not here to stop migration, but they are here to facilitate migration.
[01:59:26.257 --> 01:59:29.518]  So if that's not clear as day, just laying it out right in front of you, I don't know what is.
[01:59:32.219 --> 01:59:34.240]  Continue, because you've done a lot of important work.
[01:59:35.161 --> 01:59:36.341]  Let me mention one thing, sir.
[01:59:36.641 --> 01:59:51.005]   Alex, to Anthony's point about the rapidity, the speed that the Chinese are coming up with, I just got information a couple of hours ago that one Chinese who just came through Darien Gap a couple of weeks ago, Just got a driver's license in Brooklyn.
[01:59:51.365 --> 01:59:51.606]  Wow.
[01:59:51.646 --> 01:59:54.951]  He got instantly got a, so just like came.
[01:59:55.689 --> 01:59:56.169]  That quick.
[01:59:56.189 --> 01:59:57.190]  That guy must be a pro.
[01:59:57.230 --> 01:59:58.011]  He went straight on.
[01:59:58.471 --> 02:00:00.252]  Yeah, we got the documents and whatnot.
[02:00:00.713 --> 02:00:01.694]  It's very interesting.
[02:00:01.754 --> 02:00:03.955]  Anyway, I interrupted.
[02:00:04.215 --> 02:00:11.241]  Well, again, what I keep exaggerating is that this is about having an educated populace and we need to understand where this is coming at the highest levels.
[02:00:11.481 --> 02:00:20.027]  The lowest levels is going down and seeing these migrants that are tatted up with gang tattoos and, you know, getting all angry at that and all inflamed and saying, oh my God, this is crazy, which it is.
[02:00:20.347 --> 02:00:21.028]  I'm not saying it's not.
[02:00:21.468 --> 02:00:24.170]  But that's not going down there and just paying attention to that.
[02:00:24.190 --> 02:00:25.131]  That's not going to stop this.
[02:00:25.411 --> 02:00:26.211]  It's going to shine a light.
[02:00:26.271 --> 02:00:27.932]  It's going to open up a door and then we could dive deeper.
[02:00:27.952 --> 02:00:30.714]  But what we need to understand is who's signing off on these things.
[02:00:31.014 --> 02:00:32.355]  What are the groups that are operating this?
[02:00:33.136 --> 02:00:33.916]  We've exposed that.
[02:00:33.936 --> 02:00:36.798]  We need to continue to expose that.
[02:00:36.838 --> 02:00:37.459]  That's the key here.
[02:00:37.479 --> 02:00:45.064]  And so we all need to be educated on the groups, including the UN, the IOM, the Red Cross and others who are facilitating this invasion.
[02:00:47.526 --> 02:00:48.087]  Well, that's right.
[02:00:48.127 --> 02:00:54.255]  The media acts like this is all magically happening, but the same NGOs that ran the European invasion the last 12 years are running this.
[02:00:54.295 --> 02:00:54.956]  That's on record.
[02:00:54.976 --> 02:00:57.960]  So walk through that chain of who is running and what they're doing.
[02:00:59.722 --> 02:01:02.066]  Yeah, I mean, as far as we could sell, I mean, so here's the deal.
[02:01:03.055 --> 02:01:07.799]  They're flying into South America, and this is anybody that's not in Mexico or Central America.
[02:01:08.019 --> 02:01:12.924]  They're flying into South America, and they're using, for example, the Chinese use Douyin.
[02:01:13.204 --> 02:01:14.965]  That's the communist Chinese TikTok app.
[02:01:15.226 --> 02:01:23.953]  There's propaganda videos on there telling you exactly how to march through the Darien Gap and Central America and Mexico and cross our border.
[02:01:24.073 --> 02:01:26.075]  I mean, like, long videos that you can just find.
[02:01:26.295 --> 02:01:30.679]  And obviously, we know they can censor anything they want to on that app, but they're allowing these videos to proliferate.
[02:01:31.179 --> 02:01:33.441]  So, right then and there we know that something's afoot.
[02:01:33.461 --> 02:01:35.963]  I mean, we know that this is being promoted for some reason, right?
[02:01:36.463 --> 02:01:36.863]  There's that.
[02:01:37.344 --> 02:01:42.247]  There are... I'm going to be putting out a video soon of public Facebook groups.
[02:01:42.727 --> 02:01:45.209]  Again, we know that Facebook could censor whatever they want, right?
[02:01:45.249 --> 02:01:49.372]  I mean, you mentioned Ivermectin and they're going to take you off in about 10 minutes.
[02:01:50.073 --> 02:01:56.912]   But there's public Facebook groups that these people are using to organize caravans and arrange big operations
[02:01:56.912 --> 02:02:01.273]   of 400 or 500 people through the Darien Gap and up to the US border.
[02:02:01.273 --> 02:02:06.853]   Public Facebook groups, I'm in a few of them right now, trying to just establish contacts with people.
[02:02:06.853 --> 02:02:07.693]  So that's happening.
[02:02:07.693 --> 02:02:12.932]   So all this is going on, trekking through the Darien Gap, getting into Panama, and then Panama's essentially
[02:02:12.932 --> 02:02:16.693]   a staging area where they're getting handed maps and all this other stuff, and then bust up here
[02:02:16.693 --> 02:02:17.533]  in two weeks.
[02:02:17.533 --> 02:02:20.373]  It's a giant plan though, and even big tech is part of it.
[02:02:20.373 --> 02:02:26.453]   And again, for people that don't know, this is all officially a UN program.
[02:02:26.794 --> 02:02:27.534]  That's not debatable.
[02:02:27.554 --> 02:02:41.401]  I remember like six years ago, I'd show NBC News George Soros funding the State Department, the debit cards, and then they would have a mainstream media story saying it wasn't true, but they would announce it, and then we said it was bad, they say it wasn't true.
[02:02:43.323 --> 02:02:44.844]  It's 100% coming from the UN.
[02:02:45.125 --> 02:02:46.466]  I mean, we've exposed that.
[02:02:46.846 --> 02:02:47.787]  We've laid it out in there.
[02:02:47.807 --> 02:02:49.128]  100% coming from the UN.
[02:02:49.268 --> 02:02:52.430]  The IOM, again, that is the migration arm of the UN.
[02:02:53.211 --> 02:02:53.391]  Right?
[02:02:53.972 --> 02:02:58.696]  And these are the people that are saying that Agenda 2030 and migration, that these are agents of development.
[02:02:58.716 --> 02:02:59.816]  What's an agent of development?
[02:03:00.177 --> 02:03:01.398]  Well, I'll tell you exactly what it is.
[02:03:01.678 --> 02:03:07.523]  It's having a menial labor class come in and replace people like yourself, myself, Michael Yan.
[02:03:07.843 --> 02:03:09.324]  And this has nothing to do with race, by the way.
[02:03:09.364 --> 02:03:10.625]  I'm not even going to allow people to come in.
[02:03:10.645 --> 02:03:11.926]  No, it's driving down wages.
[02:03:11.986 --> 02:03:12.727]  It's a group they control.
[02:03:14.248 --> 02:03:14.989]  Correct.
[02:03:15.149 --> 02:03:22.032]  Plus, they're giving them court dates in 2030, 2035, so if they don't play ball and the little phone tracks them, they get deported.
[02:03:23.813 --> 02:03:24.173]  Correct.
[02:03:24.333 --> 02:03:32.777]  It's all about modern-day feudalism, which I know you've talked about, but just to lay it out one more time, you import a menial labor class, people like us, we're no longer needed, we're just a burden.
[02:03:32.957 --> 02:03:33.578]  We're a problem.
[02:03:33.638 --> 02:03:38.160]  We want too much out of life, we want free market capitalism and individualism and, you know, it's human rights.
[02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:40.241]  We're demanding too high a standard of living.
[02:03:41.260 --> 02:03:41.921]  Correct.
[02:03:42.061 --> 02:03:49.927]  And you have this whole media labor class come in and then on top of that you have artificial intelligence and just an elite managerial class and modern day feudalism and you could do away with people like us.
[02:03:50.128 --> 02:03:52.410]  That's the whole agenda here at the highest level.
[02:03:54.631 --> 02:03:56.393]  So let me ask you this, Anthony Rubin.
[02:03:56.473 --> 02:03:58.054]  How is it going for the globalists right now?
[02:04:00.456 --> 02:04:04.713]   Well, honestly, Man, I don't want to be a pessimist, okay?
[02:04:04.853 --> 02:04:06.414]  I don't want to say that they're winning, but they are winning.
[02:04:06.434 --> 02:04:07.656]  I mean, people are still coming over here.
[02:04:07.836 --> 02:04:08.597]  It's only increasing.
[02:04:08.637 --> 02:04:15.344]  Again, like I said, 2,500 people a day was the latest report that Michael and I just got like two hours ago coming through the Darien Gap.
[02:04:15.364 --> 02:04:16.105]  They're all headed up here.
[02:04:16.125 --> 02:04:17.446]  They'll be here in two weeks, right?
[02:04:17.787 --> 02:04:21.170]   So on the one hand, I would say, hey, if we're just looking at the numbers, they're winning.
[02:04:21.310 --> 02:04:30.799]  On the other hand, just over the past month, myself, Michael Yan, you guys, of course, major daggers in the side of the globalists that are running this operation.
[02:04:31.219 --> 02:04:33.201]  So, you know, it's a double-edged sword.
[02:04:33.321 --> 02:04:34.202]  I like to be an optimist.
[02:04:34.222 --> 02:04:36.124]  If I wasn't an optimist, I wouldn't be talking to you right now.
[02:04:36.484 --> 02:04:38.566]  You know, I would just be preparing myself and trying to get ready.
[02:04:39.326 --> 02:05:07.099]   I still think we have a fighting chance and I think that as long as it's not a very real correct as long as we're here on your show as long as we're still speaking getting the information out there's still a chance right if there wasn't a chance that propaganda wouldn't be necessary we got one more segment we got one more segment we had a minute till break I want to give you guys the floor but Michael Yon what else is on your radar we're gonna cover when we come back Camps. I mean, and obviously there's other things going on.
[02:05:07.099 --> 02:05:09.809]   For instance, the economy and the food supply is very important.
[02:05:09.809 --> 02:05:14.929]   Obviously, I'm very concerned on food supply. I've been writing about that quite a lot, spending a lot of time in
[02:05:14.929 --> 02:05:16.048]  places like Netherlands.
[02:05:16.048 --> 02:05:20.369]   I was just over in Japan again on the same issue on food and migration.
[02:05:20.369 --> 02:05:24.369]   And as you can see, Europe is being just overwhelmed as well.
[02:05:24.540 --> 02:05:26.443]  So this is a global attack.
[02:05:26.503 --> 02:05:27.785]  It's not just the United States.
[02:05:28.045 --> 02:05:28.466]  I agree.
[02:05:28.506 --> 02:05:28.926]  Stay there.
[02:05:29.107 --> 02:05:34.895]  How do both men who have the most critical work out there, how does everybody find your work and magnify it?
[02:05:35.195 --> 02:05:35.676]  Michael Young.
[02:05:37.428 --> 02:05:44.693]  I'm on Locals.com, Locals.com, Michael Yon, and also on Twitter, Michael underscore Yon, Y-O-N.
[02:05:45.394 --> 02:05:45.594]  Right.
[02:05:45.914 --> 02:05:49.356]  And I'm on Muckraker.com and Twitter at Real Muckraker.
[02:05:49.917 --> 02:05:51.218]  Say it again, both of you.
[02:05:53.639 --> 02:06:00.064]  Michael Yon on Twitter is Michael underscore Yon on Twitter.com and also on Locals.com, Michael Yon.
[02:06:00.704 --> 02:06:01.024]  Thank you.
[02:06:01.245 --> 02:06:01.845]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:06:01.905 --> 02:06:03.766]  No, people better share it or we're dead.
[02:06:03.927 --> 02:06:10.927]  Stay with us.
[02:06:10.927 --> 02:06:33.927]  [Gunfire]
[02:06:33.927 --> 02:06:45.927]  [Shouting]
[02:06:45.927 --> 02:06:51.927]   We can joke around and the people they're bringing here are victims of a two plus year global lockdown than our enemies.
[02:06:51.801 --> 02:06:52.842]  But they are like fire.
[02:06:53.362 --> 02:06:56.243]  A dangerous servant, a fearful master, as George Washington said.
[02:06:56.704 --> 02:07:00.085]  They are being used as the weapons to bring this country down.
[02:07:00.165 --> 02:07:02.387]  And the border has been battered down.
[02:07:02.447 --> 02:07:06.109]  It can still be defended, but we have to admit what has happened and not give up.
[02:07:06.489 --> 02:07:12.032]  Michael Yohn, Anthony Rubin, and both the great investigative reporters continue on on what we're facing and what we can do.
[02:07:14.517 --> 02:07:19.400]  Alex, last night we were on the border, on the New Mexico side, right at the wall.
[02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:20.200]  So the wall's right there.
[02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:23.181]  Border Patrol had apprehended a few people and we're searching them.
[02:07:23.621 --> 02:07:27.763]  So we're out there in the dark with Anthony Rubin and Antonio Aguero.
[02:07:28.144 --> 02:07:29.044]  And the next thing, boom!
[02:07:29.323 --> 02:07:32.403]  big rock lands right by Anthony, almost hit him.
[02:07:32.403 --> 02:07:36.202]   So the Mexican side's throwing rocks at us, which they do a lot, and actually,
[02:07:36.202 --> 02:07:41.643]   so the border patrol quickly round up, and I had to take cover behind the border patrol vehicle,
[02:07:41.643 --> 02:07:43.842]  or whatnot, and Anthony almost got hit.
[02:07:43.842 --> 02:07:45.743]   I mean, this is the kind of stuff, there's four bodies--
[02:07:45.743 --> 02:07:49.042]   So you got the state guard trying to hit Texas senators with trucks,
[02:07:49.042 --> 02:07:51.042]  obviously blasted out of his brain.
[02:07:51.042 --> 02:07:53.963]   You have the footage we showed, there's so much custody we can't play it on air.
[02:07:53.963 --> 02:07:56.803]  And you've got rocks being thrown at you, this is insane.
[02:07:58.162 --> 02:08:00.963]  Yeah, and it's like, this is the way it is constantly.
[02:08:01.235 --> 02:08:02.595]  Every day, it's something like this.
[02:08:03.536 --> 02:08:03.916]  Oh, Lord.
[02:08:04.556 --> 02:08:06.857]  Actually, you should continue about the flights and whatnot.
[02:08:07.137 --> 02:08:07.537]  Oh, yeah.
[02:08:07.677 --> 02:08:08.137]  Well, okay.
[02:08:08.237 --> 02:08:19.740]  One of the things that I think that everybody needs to be ready for and keenly aware of is that everything that we've been doing, right, us going down to the Daring Gap and, you know, Owen Schroeder on the border, exposing these people, it's way too much press.
[02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:25.384]   And I've been saying this, I'm going to continue to say it, that They can't have this operation out in the open like this.
[02:08:25.444 --> 02:08:30.428]  And what they're going to start doing is giving these people visas in their country of origin and just flying them in.
[02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:35.072]  And then there's going to be nothing that, you know, Owen Schroer, myself, or Michael Yonner, you can go do about that.
[02:08:35.112 --> 02:08:35.673]  What are we going to do?
[02:08:35.893 --> 02:08:36.253]  Who's who?
[02:08:36.293 --> 02:08:36.774]  Nobody will know.
[02:08:37.194 --> 02:08:38.415]  And so that's what they're going to start doing.
[02:08:38.435 --> 02:08:39.536]  So we need to be prepared for that.
[02:08:39.556 --> 02:08:42.218]  And we need to be on the lookout for that to happen, because that's certainly imminent.
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:46.202]  Well, you guys got a lot more intel.
[02:08:46.242 --> 02:08:48.083]  I'm asking the questions here, but just spill your guts.
[02:08:48.123 --> 02:08:49.925]  What else should millions of viewers right now know?
[02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:56.384]  Oh, for instance, the flights that Anthony just mentioned are something in play right now.
[02:08:56.464 --> 02:09:03.370]  We saw former Presidents Obama, Clinton, and Bush talking about this, I think, about five weeks ago, right?
[02:09:03.390 --> 02:09:04.170]  I think you saw that.
[02:09:04.190 --> 02:09:05.311]  I think you mentioned it, Alex.
[02:09:05.632 --> 02:09:07.793]  I saw it on television when I was in Darien Gap.
[02:09:08.334 --> 02:09:15.280]  Yeah, they're talking about flying them straight from Colombia, flying the aliens straight from Colombia and straight from Guatemala.
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:17.441]  Not to mention their countries of origin.
[02:09:18.041 --> 02:09:26.885]  And, you know, now I'm going to go out on a limb for something I don't have direct evidence for, but I have a feeling it's a matter of time until they start showing up on cruise ships.
[02:09:27.365 --> 02:09:28.666]  That is just speculation.
[02:09:28.986 --> 02:09:30.147]  I don't have evidence for that.
[02:09:30.467 --> 02:09:31.627]  But I know how they operate.
[02:09:32.007 --> 02:09:32.468]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:09:32.488 --> 02:09:38.490]  They said, the UN said last year, they may start, guys type it in, UN to use cruise ships for migrants.
[02:09:38.530 --> 02:09:39.671]  They actually said that last year.
[02:09:41.249 --> 02:09:41.810]  Oh, there you go.
[02:09:41.890 --> 02:09:44.754]  I mean, you can see that's how they operate.
[02:09:44.814 --> 02:09:49.981]  It's just a matter of time until they show up in somewhere like Miami and say, look at all the crying babies on the ship.
[02:09:50.021 --> 02:09:51.122]  We've got to let them off.
[02:09:51.483 --> 02:09:52.284]  You know how this goes.
[02:09:54.167 --> 02:09:55.508]  So what can listeners do?
[02:09:55.548 --> 02:09:57.131]  And Anthony, you've done a great job.
[02:09:57.151 --> 02:09:57.952]  We've been running over you.
[02:09:57.972 --> 02:09:58.693]  What else do you want to add?
[02:10:01.092 --> 02:10:01.873]  What can listeners do?
[02:10:02.213 --> 02:10:04.935]  Well, the first thing listeners can do is they can start speaking up.
[02:10:05.215 --> 02:10:06.997]  And speak up in places where it's difficult.
[02:10:07.177 --> 02:10:07.317]  Right?
[02:10:07.337 --> 02:10:08.137]  People need to be aware.
[02:10:08.178 --> 02:10:09.078]  We need critical mass.
[02:10:09.098 --> 02:10:10.679]  Because most people aren't even aware of this.
[02:10:11.020 --> 02:10:15.964]  Like Michael Young was saying, you know, when you're down here, some of these people that are living right on the border, right?
[02:10:16.084 --> 02:10:17.925]  Right in the exact place where this is happening.
[02:10:17.945 --> 02:10:19.086]  They're not even aware of the issue.
[02:10:19.733 --> 02:10:19.933]  Right?
[02:10:20.193 --> 02:10:23.775]  So first thing, we need a critical mass of people that are keenly aware of the situation.
[02:10:23.795 --> 02:10:24.556]  And what does that involve?
[02:10:24.576 --> 02:10:29.078]  That involves your listeners, everybody right now, going out and talking to as many people as possible.
[02:10:29.318 --> 02:10:31.839]  And it's not where you're comfortable, not your ecosystem, right?
[02:10:31.919 --> 02:10:36.562]  Where all of my friends that already agree with me, no, go, you know, your place of worship, your place of business.
[02:10:36.962 --> 02:10:40.984]  If you're in school, if you're at a university especially, educate people and get the word out.
[02:10:41.224 --> 02:10:43.185]  Because until we do that, we don't stand a chance.
[02:10:43.566 --> 02:10:43.906]  For sure.
[02:10:43.946 --> 02:10:45.066]  That's step number zero.
[02:10:45.887 --> 02:10:48.128]  Take a field trip to the border.
[02:10:48.849 --> 02:10:51.591]  Just take a field trip to the border and see for yourself.
[02:10:51.751 --> 02:10:55.213]  After that, just one or two nights on the border, you'll come back a believer.
[02:10:55.233 --> 02:10:56.293]  Well, that's right.
[02:10:56.333 --> 02:11:00.016]  I've read globalist documents that are public from the UN, the CIA, all of it.
[02:11:00.556 --> 02:11:03.017]  They don't fear Michael Yonner and Alex Jones or Carlson.
[02:11:03.037 --> 02:11:03.558]  They fear us.
[02:11:03.598 --> 02:11:11.582]  But they fear random people that they don't already have documented and tracked, shooting video they don't control, that gets out.
[02:11:11.662 --> 02:11:14.484]  People don't realize that little people are the big people.
[02:11:14.884 --> 02:11:17.087]  You're not the little people, you're the giants.
[02:11:17.547 --> 02:11:20.911]  You are unstoppable when you simply go out and gather human intelligence.
[02:11:21.232 --> 02:11:21.993]  Do I have to say a word?
[02:11:22.053 --> 02:11:27.879]  Just shoot a video, put it on your Instagram, and then re-upload it to Getter or to Rumble.
[02:11:28.460 --> 02:11:32.225]  Re-upload it to Patriot sites, but don't give up the main enemy sites.
[02:11:34.036 --> 02:11:35.617]  Uh, what you said is exactly true.
[02:11:35.657 --> 02:11:39.139]  And just to give your, uh, your listeners here, just a couple of words of encouragement.
[02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:41.080]  I'm, you know, I'm nobody really.
[02:11:41.181 --> 02:11:43.102]  I'm just a guy who did exactly what you were saying.
[02:11:43.122 --> 02:11:44.162]  I was like, whoa, this is wild.
[02:11:44.242 --> 02:11:46.544]  During COVID, I just got my camera and just started filming stuff.
[02:11:46.844 --> 02:11:48.405]  And now here I am in the Alex Jones Show.
[02:11:48.705 --> 02:11:55.830]  So if you just have, you know, some cojones and you decide to just get a camera and go out there and be active, it could take you to places that you would never expect.
[02:11:56.110 --> 02:11:57.971]  So get started and start doing it now.
[02:11:58.211 --> 02:12:00.233]  Michael, spend a few minutes on why the U.S.
[02:12:00.273 --> 02:12:14.350]  military, back when we were still the good guys, we're not saying America's bad, it's still the best house in a bad neighborhood, but the secret of Army Special Operations and the Green Berets was force multiplication and going about enemy lines and mobilizing the people.
[02:12:14.790 --> 02:12:18.895]  Explain to them the power of the people from a force multiplication perspective.
[02:12:20.373 --> 02:12:22.555]  Well, that's what I'm doing right now is force multiplying.
[02:12:22.715 --> 02:12:23.997]  That's why Anthony's sitting here.
[02:12:24.437 --> 02:12:25.558]  That's why I'm sharing.
[02:12:25.919 --> 02:12:29.362]  I'm trying to build him up and replicate what I'm doing, and it's working.
[02:12:30.043 --> 02:12:33.326]  I saw he clearly had the cojones to go down to Dairy and Gap.
[02:12:33.706 --> 02:12:34.407]  Took him down there.
[02:12:34.447 --> 02:12:35.348]  He did excellent.
[02:12:35.388 --> 02:12:37.250]  Made a documentary, which you have to see.
[02:12:37.730 --> 02:12:38.431]  Now he's doing it.
[02:12:38.491 --> 02:12:38.872]  Now he's...
[02:12:39.572 --> 02:12:42.656]  Already, he's going to be making, replicating himself.
[02:12:43.037 --> 02:12:44.338]  So force multiply.
[02:12:44.458 --> 02:12:45.520]  Teach people what you know.
[02:12:46.121 --> 02:12:48.423]  Get people out to the border and show them.
[02:12:48.984 --> 02:12:50.726]  You know, especially people like Anthony now.
[02:12:50.766 --> 02:12:51.507]  He's already growing.
[02:12:51.547 --> 02:12:53.049]  He's already got his own big audience.
[02:12:53.450 --> 02:12:55.032]  And it's force multiplication.
[02:12:55.112 --> 02:12:56.554]  Multiply, multiply, multiply.
[02:12:57.483 --> 02:13:03.166]  Well, I was never in the military, but I was 19 years old, saw the country being destroyed, was going to community college, was all communist.
[02:13:03.666 --> 02:13:11.950]  And I remember reading history and about the Green Berets and everything, and I said, if I go out and promote freedom, I won't be the leader, I don't want to be the leader.
[02:13:11.971 --> 02:13:14.292]  Other people are going to listen who are better than me, we're going to win.
[02:13:14.652 --> 02:13:16.773]  And that's been our greatest victory is force multiplication.
[02:13:17.173 --> 02:13:24.237]  And so if all our listeners don't think of themselves as leaders, but you've been leaders, if you simply wake up one person and force multiply them, it's game over.
[02:13:26.042 --> 02:13:29.384]  Actually, several of us were driving down the road the other night talking about you.
[02:13:29.824 --> 02:13:34.547]  And we were talking specifically about how Alex Jones gives everybody else the air.
[02:13:34.967 --> 02:13:36.228]  You are force multiplying.
[02:13:37.006 --> 02:13:38.327]  And now I'm forced to multiply.
[02:13:38.647 --> 02:13:40.528]  You know, this actually works.
[02:13:40.608 --> 02:13:41.549]  It works like a dream.
[02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:48.333]  And before you know it, you'll have Anthony out taking people around and he'll have, you know, it works.
[02:13:48.413 --> 02:13:53.796]  Just go out and tell people, go to the border, take your camera like Alex says, and don't give up the enemy terrain.
[02:13:54.076 --> 02:13:57.718]  Keep posting on places like YouTube and Facebook and those other places.
[02:13:58.374 --> 02:13:59.775]  And it works.
[02:14:00.135 --> 02:14:02.477]  I would also like to just say one thing that's super important.
[02:14:02.817 --> 02:14:05.499]  Everybody should know about the Ash Conformity Experiment.
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:07.081]  Alex Jones, I'm sure you already know about it.
[02:14:07.441 --> 02:14:25.414]   But I don't really want to get into the details of the experiment, but the findings of it, essentially, are that all you need, if you have a group of people and everybody's conforming, if it's just one person, there's nobody else that's going to go against the grain, against the group, it's very hard to have one person that breaks away from In closing, gentlemen, minute and a half.
[02:14:25.434 --> 02:14:28.136]  They're pre-programming that everybody's white supremacist that opposes this.
[02:14:28.156 --> 02:14:29.237]  That tells me false flag.
[02:14:29.056 --> 02:14:33.176]   circling around that and building off that nucleus right so you could be that
[02:14:33.176 --> 02:14:36.775]   nucleus all it takes that you speak up again at your university or workplace or
[02:14:36.775 --> 02:14:41.296]   wherever you may be where people might be blind to the situation. In closing
[02:14:41.296 --> 02:14:44.576]   gentlemen minute and a half they're pre-programming that everybody's white
[02:14:44.576 --> 02:14:49.416]   supremacist opposes this that tells me false flag. Michael Young and then
[02:14:49.416 --> 02:14:57.456]   Anthony Rubin what is your concern about the enemy's next move? They'll continue.
[02:14:55.761 --> 02:14:59.924]  We saw, what was that little fake Patriot thing the other day where no Antifa showed up?
[02:14:59.944 --> 02:15:00.665]  What's that thing called?
[02:15:00.685 --> 02:15:01.286]  Patriot Front!
[02:15:02.734 --> 02:15:04.935]  Yeah, you were talking about them the other day, those clowns.
[02:15:05.015 --> 02:15:08.856]  I mean, it's clearly like, I don't know who they are, but they're clearly false flag, right?
[02:15:09.216 --> 02:15:11.076]  You know, I've been doing this so long around the world.
[02:15:11.417 --> 02:15:16.758]  It's like, at some point, it becomes very easy for me to spot, for instance, Asian provocateurs.
[02:15:17.218 --> 02:15:18.038]  You know, there they are.
[02:15:18.359 --> 02:15:20.059]  I mean, how obvious can you get?
[02:15:20.339 --> 02:15:21.860]  Not only that, they even have the drums.
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:24.960]  Every time somebody shows up with drums, see the drum there?
[02:15:25.041 --> 02:15:26.461]  Those are always left-wingers, man.
[02:15:26.841 --> 02:15:35.567]  I mean, whether that's in Germany, or whether that's in Thailand, or whether that's in Hong Kong, as soon as the drums show up, you know, uh-oh, here we go.
[02:15:35.647 --> 02:15:36.768]  Violence is about to start.
[02:15:37.468 --> 02:15:38.809]  Yeah, so they're easy to spot.
[02:15:38.849 --> 02:15:40.290]  Look, they've got the same clothes.
[02:15:40.370 --> 02:15:46.454]  I mean, one of the things that you can do to help out finding out who these guys are, is when they assemble and disassemble.
[02:15:46.494 --> 02:15:50.377]  They have to go somewhere to assemble and disassemble.
[02:15:50.437 --> 02:15:51.458]  Find them and track them back.
[02:15:52.952 --> 02:15:54.033]  It's only going to take one person.
[02:15:54.073 --> 02:15:55.234]  It's already happening, exactly.
[02:15:55.594 --> 02:15:56.595]  You guys are beautiful.
[02:15:56.675 --> 02:15:57.436]  We salute you.
[02:15:57.936 --> 02:15:59.257]  Godspeed one more time.
[02:15:59.537 --> 02:16:01.099]  How do they find you, Anthony Rubin?
[02:16:01.119 --> 02:16:02.139]  How do they find Michael Yaun?
[02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:04.261]  I know most listeners get it, but this is a mission.
[02:16:04.321 --> 02:16:05.382]  You've got to promote what you're doing.
[02:16:05.402 --> 02:16:07.484]  You've got to force, multiply, and amplify, you guys.
[02:16:08.945 --> 02:16:10.026]  Muckraker.com.
[02:16:10.166 --> 02:16:12.468]  M-U-C-K-R-A-K-E-R.com.
[02:16:12.548 --> 02:16:15.110]  Or you can find me on Twitter at Real Muckraker.
[02:16:16.593 --> 02:16:21.420]  And I'm on Locals.com, Michael Yon, and on Twitter, Michael underscore Yon.
[02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:23.262]  Yeah, hard to hide what you're doing.
[02:16:23.723 --> 02:16:24.604]  God bless you, gentlemen.
[02:16:24.644 --> 02:16:25.525]  Godspeed and be safe.
[02:16:26.467 --> 02:16:28.467]  Thank you, sir.
[02:16:28.467 --> 02:16:42.467]  [Music]
[02:16:42.467 --> 02:16:44.467]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[02:16:45.132 --> 02:16:47.213]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[02:16:47.394 --> 02:16:48.794]  It will change your life.
[02:16:49.395 --> 02:16:58.099]  The UN admits and the Lansink Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[02:16:58.159 --> 02:17:02.982]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[02:17:03.482 --> 02:17:08.566]   Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[02:17:09.207 --> 02:17:13.190]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[02:17:13.651 --> 02:17:20.437]  And InfoWarStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[02:17:20.738 --> 02:17:26.764]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[02:17:27.304 --> 02:17:29.165]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[02:17:29.685 --> 02:17:31.547]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[02:17:31.927 --> 02:17:33.628]  You and your family need it.
[02:17:33.728 --> 02:17:34.929]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[02:17:35.469 --> 02:17:37.230]  X3 Tri-Iodine.
[02:17:37.330 --> 02:17:39.391]  Exclusively at InfoWarstore.com.
[02:17:39.691 --> 02:17:42.233]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[02:17:43.574 --> 02:17:46.415]  Maria Z coming up now into hour number four.
[02:17:46.575 --> 02:17:47.556]  Owen Shore at 3 p.m.
[02:17:47.576 --> 02:17:47.976]  Central.
[02:17:48.917 --> 02:17:49.617]  60 minutes from now.
[02:17:50.358 --> 02:17:51.498]  I promise to go to your calls.
[02:17:51.979 --> 02:17:53.780]  I'm gonna jam into four callers before she takes over.
[02:17:54.824 --> 02:17:57.306]  Let's go to Wayne and then Jim and then Danny and James.
[02:17:57.165 --> 02:18:01.004]  Wayne in Washington, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:18:01.004 --> 02:18:08.045]  Is Wayne gone?
[02:18:07.556 --> 02:18:08.797]  Alright Wayne, thank you sir.
[02:18:09.457 --> 02:18:09.698]  Hello?
[02:18:09.718 --> 02:18:10.218]  Hello?
[02:18:10.759 --> 02:18:11.319]  Go ahead Wayne.
[02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:16.324]  Okay, I'd like to say something about your merchandise.
[02:18:18.770 --> 02:18:20.630]  The beetroot is really, really good.
[02:18:20.830 --> 02:18:22.571]  The liver cleanse is really, really good.
[02:18:23.231 --> 02:18:29.854]  And I've got more action across the United States all the way from Maine to Panama City in Florida in regards to your t-shirts.
[02:18:30.655 --> 02:18:42.800]  The most active t-shirt that I ever wore that got conversations rolling and looking into who you are was the Hillary for prison in 2016.
[02:18:42.860 --> 02:18:44.801]  That one was a big one.
[02:18:46.897 --> 02:18:48.297]  And it really helped a lot.
[02:18:48.317 --> 02:18:50.878]  Yeah, I think we'll put a Deep State for Prison shirt up.
[02:18:51.258 --> 02:18:59.740]  No, when we went to the RNC in 2016 in Cleveland, a third of the people were wearing that shirt, and that's when the Deep State went, we're going to get this guy.
[02:19:00.260 --> 02:19:05.401]  I mean, because I'm there, there's like a hundred thousand people, and we put out hundreds of thousands of those t-shirts.
[02:19:05.421 --> 02:19:07.882]  We sold most of them at cost, like six bucks apiece.
[02:19:08.502 --> 02:19:11.324]  The listeners really got excited about that shirt.
[02:19:11.684 --> 02:19:19.728]  We sold 300,000 of them and 50 to 100,000 showed up and it made the deep state crap their britches.
[02:19:20.909 --> 02:19:22.850]  I go all across the United States.
[02:19:22.990 --> 02:19:27.752]  I ended up in a situation in Grand Junction, Colorado wearing that shirt.
[02:19:28.553 --> 02:19:36.197]  Four guys stopped their car right downtown Grand Junction in Colorado and they were walking up and I knew this was not looking good.
[02:19:37.111 --> 02:19:41.934]  And they saw that shirt on me, and I thought I was going to tie into it with these four big guys.
[02:19:42.374 --> 02:19:46.417]  They got close enough to read it, and it said, Hillary for President.
[02:19:47.037 --> 02:19:56.143]  And then they backed off, and then I got high-fives from them, but they thought I was down there in Grand Junction spouting, Hillary for President.
[02:19:57.484 --> 02:19:58.645]  Yeah, no.
[02:19:59.225 --> 02:20:02.467]  Let me tell you, you put an InfoWars shirt on, it's an adventure.
[02:20:02.628 --> 02:20:04.469]  I mean, it's an adventure.
[02:20:06.976 --> 02:20:08.557]  Look, your vitamins are great.
[02:20:08.657 --> 02:20:15.298]  I love, like I said, the beetroot and the liver cleanse and both male and female vitality.
[02:20:15.338 --> 02:20:15.818]  They're good.
[02:20:16.698 --> 02:20:18.178]  But I do love your t-shirts.
[02:20:18.338 --> 02:20:25.540]  Let me tell you, we're going to put out a new Hunter Biden for prison shirt or maybe a Deep State for prison shirt.
[02:20:25.900 --> 02:20:27.400]  What do you think new shirt we should put out?
[02:20:29.700 --> 02:20:31.861]  Tell everybody that Hunter's name is not Hunter.
[02:20:31.901 --> 02:20:33.921]  That's his middle name and his name is actually Rob.
[02:20:35.734 --> 02:20:37.034]  That's not his real name.
[02:20:37.054 --> 02:20:38.055]  He's convicted.
[02:20:38.095 --> 02:20:39.515]  He's a convicted pedophile.
[02:20:40.235 --> 02:20:41.595]  Well, what he is is a piece of garbage.
[02:20:41.615 --> 02:20:42.556]  I appreciate your call, Wayne.
[02:20:42.956 --> 02:20:44.876]  Jim in Kentucky, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:20:44.896 --> 02:20:45.256]  Go ahead.
[02:20:47.257 --> 02:20:48.457]  Remember the Alamo.
[02:20:48.557 --> 02:20:50.817]  This is our time to defend it down on the border.
[02:20:51.357 --> 02:20:55.918]  I think we need to get Texans down there, throw whatever junk cars they can drag down there.
[02:20:55.938 --> 02:21:00.299]  If we need to drag a line across that border, we drag a line across the border.
[02:21:01.159 --> 02:21:03.580]  This is our, you know, this is our time to prove.
[02:21:04.287 --> 02:21:04.867]  Ourselves.
[02:21:04.987 --> 02:21:11.209]  And the other thing is, is making sure that Soros is prosecuted as a terrorist.
[02:21:11.789 --> 02:21:18.111]  And supplying money to these different judges and these different prosecutors, they're terrorists too.
[02:21:18.812 --> 02:21:19.872]  Enforce the law.
[02:21:20.012 --> 02:21:24.313]  Make sure your congressman, your senate, your house, call them every day if you need to.
[02:21:24.393 --> 02:21:26.414]  Tell them we want these terrorists arrested.
[02:21:26.834 --> 02:21:28.895]  George Soros, all his assets frozen.
[02:21:29.841 --> 02:21:33.925]  I totally agree George Soros is as bad as it gets, but he himself is a front.
[02:21:33.945 --> 02:21:35.606]  The State Department uses him.
[02:21:36.427 --> 02:21:43.273]  Trump ended the State Department, WHO, and Border Deal, and the whole replacement migration refugee program.
[02:21:43.293 --> 02:21:46.736]  But yeah, it's our government doing this through Soros.
[02:21:47.585 --> 02:21:48.586]  Amen to that, Jim.
[02:21:48.485 --> 02:21:53.885]   George Soros is paying FBI officials and CIA officials and they need to be
[02:21:53.885 --> 02:21:58.525]   arrested for terrorism too. Anybody involved with George Soros is a
[02:21:58.525 --> 02:22:03.485]   terrorist and needs to be arrested and put in prison as the terrorist law states.
[02:22:03.485 --> 02:22:09.925]   Amen to that Jim. I can't disagree with you. Well have a great day.
[02:22:08.745 --> 02:22:09.745]  Thank you brother.
[02:22:09.745 --> 02:22:15.385]   Alright, two final calls and Maria Z from Australia, the beta test for all of this is
[02:22:15.385 --> 02:22:19.104]  straight ahead on Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:22:19.104 --> 02:22:22.985]  Tomorrow's news today, just give them the freedom.
[02:22:22.985 --> 02:22:26.825]  Just give us the freedom, we spare your lives.
[02:22:26.825 --> 02:22:29.905]  Firing those red pills out like nobody else in the world.
[02:22:30.249 --> 02:22:32.331]  And we wish we weren't number one, folks, but we are.
[02:22:32.971 --> 02:22:34.032]  So we're not backing down.
[02:22:34.392 --> 02:22:35.653]  The responsibility is ours.
[02:22:36.174 --> 02:22:38.876]  Igniting liberty worldwide!
[02:22:41.298 --> 02:22:45.141]  For those about to rock, we salute you!
[02:22:45.161 --> 02:22:49.224]  All right, Danny and then James.
[02:22:51.126 --> 02:22:53.327]  Danny, you're on the air from the great state of Kentucky.
[02:22:53.368 --> 02:22:53.688]  Welcome.
[02:22:55.171 --> 02:22:55.991]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:22:56.411 --> 02:22:57.592]  I'm fired up, brother.
[02:22:58.892 --> 02:22:59.592]  I hear you, my man.
[02:22:59.612 --> 02:23:03.173]  Well, I'm going to play a little crowder with you and try to change your mind about an issue.
[02:23:03.513 --> 02:23:03.913]  Yes, sir.
[02:23:05.934 --> 02:23:10.735]  You referenced the Buffalo shooting a few times, and I did a little checking into that.
[02:23:11.415 --> 02:23:14.936]  So, I think it was on your show.
[02:23:14.996 --> 02:23:16.337]  I know it was on Bandot Video.
[02:23:16.357 --> 02:23:17.977]  They were the firearms experts.
[02:23:18.689 --> 02:23:22.770]  Talking about the proficiency of the shooter in that whole scenario.
[02:23:23.191 --> 02:23:27.872]  Yeah, how quick he had target acquisition, how well trained he appeared to be, and all of that.
[02:23:28.512 --> 02:23:32.794]  And for just a real short side road, do you know the name Stan Meyer?
[02:23:33.934 --> 02:23:34.634]  It does ring a bell.
[02:23:35.855 --> 02:23:37.715]  Stan Meyer was in the 70s or 80s.
[02:23:37.936 --> 02:23:41.757]  He patented a water-powered vehicle, a water-powered car.
[02:23:42.117 --> 02:23:42.777]  I remember that, yeah.
[02:23:42.957 --> 02:23:44.178]  Well, yeah.
[02:23:44.378 --> 02:23:51.645]   Well, the security guard at that grocery In Buffalo, his name was Aaron Salter.
[02:23:52.065 --> 02:23:58.430]  He owned AWS Hydrogen Technologies and had four patents out for water-powered vehicles.
[02:23:58.731 --> 02:23:59.371]  I remember that.
[02:23:59.431 --> 02:24:00.852]  People thought, yeah, that was weird.
[02:24:01.332 --> 02:24:02.513]  So, that's the thing.
[02:24:02.593 --> 02:24:08.218]  So, was it actually a white supremacist thing or was it actually another federal false flag?
[02:24:08.258 --> 02:24:11.020]  Well, there's so many false flags, you know, who knows?
[02:24:12.261 --> 02:24:16.324]  I mean, I said a month before they're going to target black grocery stores because they were hyping it up so much.
[02:24:17.714 --> 02:24:17.914]  Right.
[02:24:17.954 --> 02:24:19.554]  It's very coincidental.
[02:24:19.895 --> 02:24:24.656]  I mean, when do quit being coincidences, but that he had these patents.
[02:24:24.756 --> 02:24:28.797]  And just to reference something you were talking about with the caller earlier about investing.
[02:24:29.237 --> 02:24:37.719]  Now, I don't recommend this for everybody because options are a little risky, but I will say when this whole fiasco started with Bud Light, I shorted the company.
[02:24:38.239 --> 02:24:39.280]  That was a smart move.
[02:24:39.340 --> 02:24:40.240]  I bet you made some money.
[02:24:41.777 --> 02:24:47.020]  Well, my options do not expire until January, and the next earnings call isn't until July.
[02:24:47.501 --> 02:24:50.682]  And so, yes, it's already printing money for me.
[02:24:51.123 --> 02:24:54.605]  But come July, that earnings call, I think it's going to pay off very well.
[02:24:54.625 --> 02:24:55.405]  I never thought of that.
[02:24:55.545 --> 02:24:57.046]  Short, short, bud light.
[02:24:57.246 --> 02:24:59.768]  I'm not saying do that, but that sounds like a pretty good bet.
[02:25:00.948 --> 02:25:03.750]  Yeah, like I said, not financial advice, but I feel like a good bet.
[02:25:03.770 --> 02:25:05.051]  Short, short, Anheuser-Busch.
[02:25:05.431 --> 02:25:06.932]  And I never got to it today.
[02:25:06.972 --> 02:25:15.985]   Did you see, in fact, get it queued up, did you see the new Miller Lite said, hold my beer, which was number one until 20 years ago.
[02:25:16.305 --> 02:25:20.129]  They now came out with a whole feminist garbage.
[02:25:20.729 --> 02:25:32.378]  And it's funny you use the word garbage because what their campaign is, they're saying, send us all of your old beer advertisements with women in bikinis and all that.
[02:25:32.398 --> 02:25:33.599]  We're going to compost it.
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:41.150]   Let our worms turn that into fertilizer and grow what we're going to grow, grow the Yes, sir.
[02:25:40.989 --> 02:25:43.328]  and everything to make your beer out of that.
[02:25:43.328 --> 02:25:46.128]  We should all go from local brewers.
[02:25:46.128 --> 02:25:49.110]   I gotta say Bud Light tastes like rat piss on anybody who drinks it.
[02:25:49.110 --> 02:25:50.649]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:25:50.649 --> 02:25:52.588]  I will tell you, yes sir, you have a good one, Alec.
[02:25:52.588 --> 02:25:53.429]  Thank you.
[02:25:53.429 --> 02:25:56.989]   All right, we got one more call before Maria Z takes over, but since we mentioned I meant to get to it,
[02:25:56.989 --> 02:25:58.610]  there's a full article on Infowars.
[02:25:58.610 --> 02:26:05.729]   So weeks after Bud Light loses 25% of its stock, 29% of its market share, the biggest plunge ever,
[02:26:05.729 --> 02:26:12.809]   get woke, go broke, now another piss beer producer, Sorry we drank Miller Lite, but give me a break folks.
[02:26:12.904 --> 02:26:13.484]  That's not beer.
[02:26:14.004 --> 02:26:18.685]  They have now come out with a woman lecturing you, apologizing for women in bikinis.
[02:26:18.965 --> 02:26:20.466]  We're loving women in bikinis.
[02:26:20.486 --> 02:26:21.366]  We're loving fun.
[02:26:21.666 --> 02:26:24.907]  The idea is you're at the beach, you're having a good time, people are playing volleyball.
[02:26:25.207 --> 02:26:26.587]  She apologizes.
[02:26:26.967 --> 02:26:34.329]  So having sex with kids is okay, and all this sexualization of kids, but men and women having a good time, that's a bad idea.
[02:26:34.549 --> 02:26:35.029]  Here's the ad.
[02:26:37.301 --> 02:26:38.261]  Here's a little known fact.
[02:26:38.702 --> 02:26:41.483]  Women were among the very first to brew beer ever.
[02:26:42.123 --> 02:26:47.125]  From Mesopotamia to the Middle Ages to Colonial America, women were the ones doing the brewing.
[02:26:47.786 --> 02:26:51.847]  Centuries later, how did the industry pay homage to the founding mothers of beer?
[02:26:51.867 --> 02:26:54.028]  They put us in bikinis.
[02:26:55.189 --> 02:26:55.449]  Wow!
[02:26:55.849 --> 02:26:57.730]  Look at this sh**!
[02:27:00.697 --> 02:27:01.277]  Wild!
[02:27:01.698 --> 02:27:03.459]  It's time beer made it up to women.
[02:27:03.479 --> 02:27:15.108]  So today, Miller Lite is on a mission to clean up not just their shit, but the whole beer industry's shit. Miller Lite has been scouring the internet for all this shit and buying it back so that he can turn it into good shit for women brewers.
[02:27:15.629 --> 02:27:18.151]  Literally, good shit. How, you ask?
[02:27:18.651 --> 02:27:19.772]  Ladies, take it away.
[02:27:20.513 --> 02:27:22.434]  First, we turn the bad shit into compost.
[02:27:22.754 --> 02:27:24.176]  Then we feed compost to worms.
[02:27:24.736 --> 02:27:26.858]  We shit out beautiful fertilizer.
[02:27:28.140 --> 02:27:31.121]  That good shit helps farmers grow quality hops.
[02:27:32.642 --> 02:27:38.524]  Which has been donated to women brewers to make their own really good shit. But there's definitely more shit out there.
[02:27:38.785 --> 02:27:40.865]  In your attic, in the garage, in your parents' basement.
[02:27:41.206 --> 02:27:44.247]  Send any shit you got into Miller Lite and they'll turn that into good shit too.
[02:27:46.628 --> 02:27:48.429]  So the idea is... So here's to women.
[02:27:48.749 --> 02:27:51.251]  Because without us... Men are out to get women.
[02:27:51.711 --> 02:27:53.072]  And men having a good time is bad.
[02:27:53.392 --> 02:27:54.073]  Kill your brand.
[02:27:54.113 --> 02:27:55.133]  But it's all weaponized.
[02:27:55.714 --> 02:27:57.315]  Men and women are the same species.
[02:27:57.335 --> 02:27:58.015]  We're on the same team.
[02:27:58.035 --> 02:27:59.056]  They're out to get us all.
[02:27:59.316 --> 02:28:01.337]  The system's not for women, folks.
[02:28:01.777 --> 02:28:03.678]  Evil corporations are trying to manipulate you.
[02:28:04.519 --> 02:28:05.780]  Let's go to James in Michigan.
[02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:06.300]  You're on the air.
[02:28:06.340 --> 02:28:06.700]  Go ahead.
[02:28:06.740 --> 02:28:11.143]  And then... A very powerful, evil woman, because she supports freedom.
[02:28:11.463 --> 02:28:12.524]  Maria Z takes over.
[02:28:12.864 --> 02:28:13.664]  James in Michigan.
[02:28:13.684 --> 02:28:14.065]  Go ahead.
[02:28:14.085 --> 02:28:16.006]  Alex.
[02:28:17.132 --> 02:28:18.133]  Hi Alex.
[02:28:18.613 --> 02:28:20.435]  I just wanted to say a couple things.
[02:28:20.455 --> 02:28:28.762]  So, the definition of fascism by Mussolini is the marriage between the state and corporations.
[02:28:29.563 --> 02:28:34.127]  We have to realize that the establishment, the globalists, they believe in a public-private partnership.
[02:28:34.167 --> 02:28:35.127]  That is fascism.
[02:28:35.948 --> 02:28:37.630]  And the left and right, these are distractions.
[02:28:37.710 --> 02:28:45.036]  They use cultural Marxism to divide us against each other so we can't react to their massive, crazy plans.
[02:28:45.649 --> 02:28:55.014]  Fascism, the collaboration between the state and government, it will naturally create corruption and will cause otherwise preventable deaths and famine.
[02:28:57.095 --> 02:28:58.496]  And I wanted to say something.
[02:28:59.376 --> 02:29:06.780]  Also, recently, the last few days, my head has been, like, buzzing, like, it feels like my head's in a microwave.
[02:29:07.728 --> 02:29:12.136]  And I started doing some research and I looked up Havana Syndrome and I heard of that.
[02:29:12.757 --> 02:29:22.136]   And then I looked at the bottom of the Wikipedia pages and it says, in March they were There's major studies that 5G and other stuff creates the Havana Syndrome and all the rest of it.
[02:29:22.015 --> 02:29:26.536]   on animals, exposing them to an extended period of time to RF energy, and attempt to recreate
[02:29:26.536 --> 02:29:27.536]  Havana syndrome.
[02:29:27.536 --> 02:29:29.536]  I live in Michigan, this is, this is, uh, Michigan.
[02:29:29.536 --> 02:29:34.895]   No, no, there's major studies that 5G and other stuff creates the Havana syndrome and
[02:29:34.895 --> 02:29:35.895]  all the rest of it.
[02:29:35.895 --> 02:29:40.495]   And the government gets sick around all these antennas and they blame the Russians when
[02:29:40.495 --> 02:29:42.015]  it's their own damn antennas.
[02:29:42.015 --> 02:29:45.255]  Yeah, so I'm actually a physicist.
[02:29:45.383 --> 02:29:49.029]  I'm actually an electromagnetic physicist, and I've actually worked on 5G.
[02:29:49.590 --> 02:30:02.923]   I'm not really sold on the 5G, but I'm willing to bet that there's other frequencies that they're potentially using, low orbit satellites with phased array antennas to target maybe
[02:30:02.923 --> 02:30:07.813]   people they deem as right-wing extremists to try to maybe scramble their brains.
[02:30:07.813 --> 02:30:12.813]   We know that's in the studies. Send us show tips, a report, we'll probably get you on as a guest.
[02:30:12.813 --> 02:30:15.813]  Thank you so much, thanks for calling, James.
[02:30:15.813 --> 02:30:19.813]   Alright, I'm going to play a little clip because she's from Australia of Humongous
[02:30:19.813 --> 02:30:22.813]   and Road Warrior saying just give us the gas, we spare your lives.
[02:30:22.813 --> 02:30:25.813]   They're cutting off our gas, they're cutting off our fuel, this is the real control,
[02:30:25.813 --> 02:30:28.813]   and she'll take over, we're going to skip this network break, and the last network break
[02:30:28.813 --> 02:30:31.873]  she gets her time back, she does an amazing job, Maria Z.
[02:30:31.873 --> 02:30:33.813]  from Australia, but here is Humongous.
[02:30:33.813 --> 02:30:47.813]  Greetings from the Humongous!
[02:30:48.237 --> 02:30:49.398]  The Lord Humongous!
[02:30:50.559 --> 02:30:52.961]  The Warrior of the Wasteland!
[02:30:54.863 --> 02:30:59.006]  The Ayatollah of Rock and Roller!
[02:31:01.608 --> 02:31:03.810]  I am gravely disappointed.
[02:31:04.771 --> 02:31:08.614]  Again you have made me unleash my jokes of war.
[02:31:08.634 --> 02:31:11.616]  Look at what remains of your gallant scouts.
[02:31:12.357 --> 02:31:12.978]  Why?
[02:31:13.824 --> 02:31:15.824]  Because you're selfish.
[02:31:15.824 --> 02:31:17.824]  You hoard your gasoline.
[02:31:17.824 --> 02:31:19.824]  You do not listen to reason.
[02:31:19.824 --> 02:31:25.824]   Now my prisoners say, you plan to take your gasoline out of the wasteland.
[02:31:25.824 --> 02:31:29.824]  You send them out this morning to find a vehicle.
[02:31:29.824 --> 02:31:33.824]  And now from Australia, the great Maria Z.
[02:31:33.824 --> 02:31:37.824]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:31:37.927 --> 02:31:41.292]  Really, really love that last segment with Michael Yon.
[02:31:41.312 --> 02:31:42.274]  He's such a great guy.
[02:31:42.374 --> 02:31:43.596]  And Anthony Rubin.
[02:31:44.077 --> 02:31:45.419]  Do me a favour, everyone.
[02:31:45.599 --> 02:31:55.467]   If you are watching this right now or tuning in, just type into Google UN replacement migration. United Nations replacement migration.
[02:31:55.467 --> 02:32:00.676]   They don't even hide that this is their agenda. You literally, it's the first link that
[02:32:00.676 --> 02:32:05.346]   comes up, they call it replacement migration. Now it's under the guise of, you know, an aging
[02:32:05.346 --> 02:32:11.537]   and declining population because they've killed so many off with the poison shots, but they
[02:32:11.537 --> 02:32:17.727]   literally are proud of their agenda to replace you with migrants.
[02:32:17.699 --> 02:32:22.003]  Now, this is happening in lockstep, just like they did with COVID.
[02:32:22.363 --> 02:32:32.892]  Every single country is weaponizing these migrants against their own people, referring to them as white supremacists and Nazis and things of this nature, and we will go into that today.
[02:32:33.352 --> 02:32:35.454]  But I just wanted to share some figures with you.
[02:32:36.875 --> 02:32:43.777]  You know, this agenda is much harder to orchestrate in Australia than it is in the United States because we're surrounded by water.
[02:32:44.197 --> 02:32:59.942]  But Westpac, which is one of our major four banks, their latest housing pulse estimates that a record high 400,000 net overseas migrants landed in Australia in 2022, which was also the second highest growth rate.
[02:32:59.962 --> 02:33:00.562]  Listen to this.
[02:33:01.455 --> 02:33:06.202]  As a share of the total population since the end of the Second World War.
[02:33:06.523 --> 02:33:08.486]  400,000 people might not seem like a lot.
[02:33:09.207 --> 02:33:14.154]  It does when you consider that we have a population of roughly 26 million people only.
[02:33:15.279 --> 02:33:22.247]  So the official documents that our government put out there are that there are 200,000 migrants that they want to bring in per year.
[02:33:22.628 --> 02:33:29.956]  However, leaked government documents show that more than 700,000 new migrants will be entering our country by 2024.
[02:33:29.996 --> 02:33:31.298]  That's less than a year away.
[02:33:33.561 --> 02:33:34.722]  Absolutely.
[02:33:34.762 --> 02:33:44.334]  And while it is harder to orchestrate, like I said, because we're surrounded by water, the government's just putting it into policy that these people can come in.
[02:33:44.915 --> 02:33:46.456]  It's absolutely astounding to me.
[02:33:46.537 --> 02:33:52.182]   And then within that 140,000 So the official policy is 200,000 migrants per year.
[02:33:52.402 --> 02:33:57.044]  They're talking about, you know, the leaked documents show they're planning on letting an additional 700,000 in by next year.
[02:33:56.863 --> 02:34:05.003]   100,000 in by next year and within that official 200,000 figure, 140,000 of those should apparently
[02:34:05.003 --> 02:34:07.243]  be skilled migrants.
[02:34:07.243 --> 02:34:10.603]  So why do we need such high levels of immigration?
[02:34:10.586 --> 02:34:13.786]  Because of a skilled worker shortage in Australia.
[02:34:13.806 --> 02:34:15.327]  That's their justification.
[02:34:16.247 --> 02:34:23.628]  And when you look at it closely, their breakdown of skilled migrants says things along the lines of labourers for rural areas.
[02:34:24.748 --> 02:34:29.329]  So now Australians apparently don't know how to dig a hole or build a road or work on a farm.
[02:34:29.389 --> 02:34:31.009]  We need migrants to come and do it.
[02:34:31.049 --> 02:34:33.930]  That's the skill shortage that we have in this country apparently.
[02:34:34.984 --> 02:34:38.566]  None of these migrants are going into rural areas, of course.
[02:34:39.286 --> 02:34:44.149]  I know people in the building industry, for example, who will tell you this.
[02:34:44.249 --> 02:34:48.111]  I can tell you this from working in the employment industry.
[02:34:48.211 --> 02:34:53.042]   My job Was some time ago as I was an employment consultant.
[02:34:53.162 --> 02:34:56.403]  I helped welfare recipients specifically.
[02:34:56.743 --> 02:35:09.307]  So these are people that are long-term welfare recipients because I had a specialist caseload, over a hundred people on my caseload and they were all long-term welfare recipients.
[02:35:09.907 --> 02:35:18.170]  And I worked in the most, a suburb that's known as the most multicultural suburb in Sydney, in Australia.
[02:35:19.151 --> 02:35:25.137]  And of course, you know, the way that they do this in Australia is that they've been doing this for a very long time.
[02:35:25.177 --> 02:35:26.538]  They bring these people in.
[02:35:26.819 --> 02:35:28.220]  They don't speak the language.
[02:35:28.300 --> 02:35:31.523]  They don't have the skills or they come here and they say, oh, I'm sick.
[02:35:31.583 --> 02:35:32.264]  I can't work.
[02:35:32.304 --> 02:35:35.247]  And then they become long term welfare recipients.
[02:35:35.587 --> 02:35:39.911]  And in Australia, we don't really have a limit to how long you can be on welfare.
[02:35:40.011 --> 02:35:45.156]  So, you know, they've been training up the population for a UBI for a very long time.
[02:35:45.196 --> 02:35:52.202]  So these welfare, these migrants come in, you know, under the guise of helping Australia with our skills shortage.
[02:35:52.582 --> 02:35:56.985]   They get together in Many, many people living in one home.
[02:35:57.145 --> 02:35:58.305]  Often that is the case.
[02:35:58.345 --> 02:36:03.187]  You know, I know of one particular house, I had 20 different people living in one house.
[02:36:03.247 --> 02:36:04.447]  Of course, the landlord didn't know.
[02:36:04.667 --> 02:36:06.288]  They were all collecting welfare.
[02:36:06.308 --> 02:36:11.330]   And when you've got 20 people under one roof collecting welfare, then They're doing pretty alright.
[02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:24.937]  And then they go to these English classes, the programs that Australia offers, you know, two years for an English class and then if you need further classes you can do it and then you've got this waiting period before you can sit the English class again.
[02:36:25.518 --> 02:36:33.722]  I knew people, some of my clients on my caseload that were doing these English classes in cycles for 20 years.
[02:36:35.566 --> 02:36:39.990]  Twenty years in the country and not learning the language, sitting there on welfare.
[02:36:40.050 --> 02:36:47.235]  Now, again, the welfare system in the United States is very different, but the UBI's that they want to bring into every single country are the same.
[02:36:47.315 --> 02:36:52.119]  So what I'm telling you is, again, as Alex said, this is tested in Australia.
[02:36:52.199 --> 02:36:54.241]  It has been tested for a very long time.
[02:36:54.581 --> 02:37:04.364]   And as someone who was Trying to get these people into work and watching them give every excuse under the sun and then the government coming in and saying, oh, they've had a tough life because they're migrants.
[02:37:04.404 --> 02:37:05.604]  We've got to go easy on them.
[02:37:06.164 --> 02:37:16.546]  And, you know, it was it was unbelievable to me watching people get away with just mooching off the system for years on end.
[02:37:17.527 --> 02:37:22.848]  Needless to say, I was a very, very tough love employment consultant, very successful at getting people into work.
[02:37:22.908 --> 02:37:30.721]   But I did witness The government constantly making excuses for people being lazy, for people not working for years on end.
[02:37:30.761 --> 02:37:32.222]  And this is where this is heading.
[02:37:32.602 --> 02:37:39.063]  You know, all of these people that are flooding into the United States under the United Nations Replacement Migration Agenda.
[02:37:39.103 --> 02:37:50.266]  And as Alex so adequately put it, these people have, the United Nations has destroyed these people's countries in order to eventually bring them into the United States to collapse the country.
[02:37:50.996 --> 02:37:52.577]  And it's the same thing everywhere.
[02:37:52.597 --> 02:37:58.039]  You know, it's been happening in the UK for so long, for years now, for years.
[02:37:58.099 --> 02:38:01.640]  This stuff has been wargamed before it happened to the United States.
[02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:06.242]  The only difference is you've got this open border just inviting this invasion in.
[02:38:06.542 --> 02:38:12.544]  And not all of these people have, you know, ill intentions.
[02:38:13.585 --> 02:38:16.206]  But what will happen is they'll be given a UBI.
[02:38:17.569 --> 02:38:21.092]  And they'll do whatever the government tells them, because they are invaders.
[02:38:21.572 --> 02:38:29.719]  In the back of their mind, they know that they're invaders, so they'll comply with whatever the government tells them they need to do to stay in the country.
[02:38:29.799 --> 02:38:32.401]  And, you know, I mean, they've conditioned them from day dot.
[02:38:32.421 --> 02:38:33.742]  They're giving them these phones.
[02:38:33.802 --> 02:38:36.564]  The government is already providing for their needs.
[02:38:36.985 --> 02:38:45.051]  God only knows what these phones are for and how it'll be weaponised, whether there's, you know, frequencies that can come out of these phones that change these people's behaviour.
[02:38:45.271 --> 02:38:45.772]  We don't know.
[02:38:46.272 --> 02:38:55.614]  We don't know if these phones that have been given to these migrants in the United States, these illegal aliens, I should say, are weapons.
[02:38:56.694 --> 02:39:00.115]  But what I can tell you is that the conditioning has started from day one.
[02:39:01.215 --> 02:39:13.298]  Here's the government's giving you, the government's providing for you, and they will be taught to accept a UBI and live by a UBI from the get-go.
[02:39:14.696 --> 02:39:18.737]  So that's a bit of background about how this is happening in lockstep in Australia as well.
[02:39:18.777 --> 02:39:27.099]  The other really interesting thing is that, you know, we just had a protest against this mass migration in Australia that's absolutely insane.
[02:39:27.119 --> 02:39:30.060]  You know, we've already got a housing shortage in this country.
[02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:37.282]  And the proposal from the government is that they're about to start giving grants to people to go and buy a house.
[02:39:38.662 --> 02:39:42.123]  With a friend or a family member so that they can share their accommodation.
[02:39:42.183 --> 02:39:46.345]  You look at the plans of the United Nations, the WEF, for smart cities.
[02:39:47.145 --> 02:39:51.827]  It's all about communal living, you know, sharing living rooms.
[02:39:52.267 --> 02:39:55.128]  If you're not using your living room, your neighbor will use it.
[02:39:55.168 --> 02:39:57.509]  And sharing kitchens and sharing bathrooms.
[02:39:58.289 --> 02:40:05.158]  Again, it links into the transhumanist agenda and this transgender nonsense where you'll share a bathroom with the opposite gender.
[02:40:05.178 --> 02:40:14.029]  Well, they're dehumanizing you to the point where you'll live in these communal living areas because there's this housing shortage that's been created by the replacement migration.
[02:40:15.538 --> 02:40:19.101]  And then you'll be forced to live in these environments.
[02:40:19.121 --> 02:40:19.902]  They're already doing that.
[02:40:19.922 --> 02:40:30.751]  They're using the quarantine camps in Australia that were built during the time of COVID for dissidents now to assist with the housing shortage, seeking all these people.
[02:40:30.791 --> 02:40:33.053]  They want to put them all in to the camps.
[02:40:33.253 --> 02:40:34.554]  That's what they'll be used for now.
[02:40:35.215 --> 02:40:37.577]  Later they'll be used for dissent and you can mark my words.
[02:40:37.617 --> 02:40:45.535]   But this protest that happened over the weekend There's an article that's just come out and I've sent it to the team if they want to bring it up.
[02:40:46.656 --> 02:40:56.487]  The article is essentially saying that our Prime Minister and Peter Dutton have lashed dangerous and evil Nazi protests.
[02:40:57.099 --> 02:40:59.361]  So I'm just going to read some of this article for you.
[02:40:59.761 --> 02:41:08.927]  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton have both blasted evil Nazi sympathisers after a rally in Melbourne on the weekend.
[02:41:09.428 --> 02:41:28.567]   He said, this is Albanese, our Prime Minister, right-wing extremism was the most significant threat facing Australia and said that the time for tolerance of these matters has long gone and people should have a look at the consequences that their hatred Of that hatred and theirs was an ideology of hate.
[02:41:28.627 --> 02:41:34.249]  The reason that he's saying this is because people have come for an anti-immigration rally.
[02:41:34.289 --> 02:41:42.171]  We have this housing shortage where people are being told that they can go and live in quarantine camps because they have nowhere else to live.
[02:41:42.471 --> 02:41:51.574]  And we're bringing in, according to leaked government documents, on top of the already post-World War II levels of migration, another 700,000, over 700,000 by next year.
[02:41:54.890 --> 02:41:58.355]  Why are we bringing in all these people when we already have this housing shortage?
[02:42:00.313 --> 02:42:05.236]  And so of course people are going to protest, but they're being referred to as neo-Nazis.
[02:42:05.276 --> 02:42:07.077]  Why are they being referred to as neo-Nazis?
[02:42:07.097 --> 02:42:10.078]  We've never had a problem with Nazis in Australia.
[02:42:10.118 --> 02:42:11.539]  This has never been a thing.
[02:42:11.819 --> 02:42:14.581]  You don't see people walking around doing the salute.
[02:42:14.681 --> 02:42:16.582]  It's not something that Australians do.
[02:42:16.602 --> 02:42:18.263]  We're very mild-mannered people.
[02:42:18.923 --> 02:42:22.545]  So why do we suddenly have this problem with Nazis turning up at every rally?
[02:42:22.865 --> 02:42:24.986]  It happened at a transgender rally recently.
[02:42:25.006 --> 02:42:26.127]  Not a transgender, sorry.
[02:42:26.327 --> 02:42:27.548]  Let me rephrase that.
[02:42:27.928 --> 02:42:29.609]  A women's rights rally.
[02:42:30.379 --> 02:42:37.041]  That was defending women and women's spaces against men dressed as women pretending to be women coming in.
[02:42:38.422 --> 02:42:40.342]  Because we should be protecting women.
[02:42:40.623 --> 02:42:45.504]  That's what equality and all of these, you know, women's rights groups are about, aren't they?
[02:42:46.685 --> 02:42:55.868]  So people were rallying in support of women's rights and all of a sudden it was gatecrashed by transgender people with purple hair and Nazis!
[02:42:57.103 --> 02:42:58.524]  What are Nazis doing there?
[02:42:58.864 --> 02:43:02.467]  And of course, you know, they're not real Nazis.
[02:43:02.947 --> 02:43:09.512]  These are the same types of infiltrators that we see in the United States every time there's, you know, Antifa turns up at a rally.
[02:43:09.532 --> 02:43:11.333]  This is the same thing.
[02:43:11.413 --> 02:43:13.455]  These people are clearly feds.
[02:43:14.376 --> 02:43:17.338]  I can't prove it, but the markers are all there.
[02:43:17.398 --> 02:43:18.899]  Michael Yon was just talking about it.
[02:43:19.938 --> 02:43:31.806]  So out of nowhere, you have a women's rights rally, you have these trans people anti-protesters coming and saying, no, no, we deserve to, you know, dress up as whatever we want and invade your private spaces.
[02:43:32.807 --> 02:43:34.348]  And then Nazis turn up.
[02:43:35.428 --> 02:43:37.630]  It's just the most bizarre thing.
[02:43:37.990 --> 02:43:41.973]  And this is what's happened as well at this anti-immigration rally.
[02:43:42.876 --> 02:43:48.998]  And so this is why they're saying now we have this Nazi problem in Australia and we need to eradicate it.
[02:43:49.098 --> 02:43:56.859]  And they're equating anyone that's a right-leaning person or a right-thinking person as an extremist and a Nazi.
[02:43:57.180 --> 02:44:03.521]  So today, everyone, according to the Australian government, you and I, because we think the right way, we are Nazis.
[02:44:03.841 --> 02:44:04.521]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:44:04.781 --> 02:44:06.882]  I'm going to continue with this right after this short break.
[02:44:07.422 --> 02:44:09.123]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:09.203 --> 02:44:12.324]  I'm your guest host, Maria Zee from ZeeMedia.com.
[02:44:12.364 --> 02:44:16.525]  Right there on your screen you were just seeing the ZeeMedia.com website.
[02:44:16.945 --> 02:44:30.090]  Last week we interviewed a gentleman named Aaron Leshon who went to a court here in Australia and the magistrate said to him, he asked her because they were sort of butting heads, and he said to her, am I your property, Your Majesty?
[02:44:30.590 --> 02:44:31.291]  Your Honour, sorry.
[02:44:31.711 --> 02:44:32.211]  She said yes.
[02:44:32.891 --> 02:44:33.832]  You are, actually.
[02:44:33.912 --> 02:44:36.173]  She actually said, you are my property.
[02:44:36.954 --> 02:44:39.215]  Really, really astounding event.
[02:44:39.235 --> 02:44:46.880]  We've got the court papers in that report and I just wonder how widespread is this thinking?
[02:44:46.921 --> 02:44:54.926]  Was this a one-off or are we going to see more and more government officials officially coming out there and just openly stating, you are our property?
[02:44:55.246 --> 02:44:56.407]  It's amazing to me.
[02:44:56.767 --> 02:44:58.629]  But just back on this Nazi nonsense.
[02:44:58.970 --> 02:45:14.127]  So Biden is saying the biggest threat to the United States is white supremacy because how dare you speak out about illegal immigrants coming into your country and taking over your country and being conditioned for a UBI and becoming essentially useless as the government wants them to be.
[02:45:14.187 --> 02:45:15.708]  Not because they want to be useless.
[02:45:15.748 --> 02:45:17.991]  You know, some of those will, some of them will rise above that.
[02:45:18.751 --> 02:45:30.259]  But the government wants these people to be useless and I gave the example before through our welfare system that has been weaponized to keep people in a welfare state, a welfare society.
[02:45:30.279 --> 02:45:46.010]   You know our taxes are so incredibly high in this country and you know a huge portion of that goes towards long-term unemployed people who are not interested in getting a job and the government allows to have every Excuse under the sun to not get a job.
[02:45:46.371 --> 02:45:52.657]  And I'm telling you that as someone who worked in the industry trying to get people off welfare.
[02:45:53.358 --> 02:46:01.447]  But they go on to say there's no place in Australia for the sorts of demonstrations that we've seen now on a number of occasions here in Melbourne.
[02:46:01.747 --> 02:46:13.894]  With people paying tribute to Nazism and evil doctrine that resulted in the mass murder of people on the basis of their religion, on the basis of who they were, on the basis of their sexual preference.
[02:46:13.914 --> 02:46:30.906]   You can find some information, whether you believe it or not, there are records that Because homosexuality was not legal at the time of World War II in Germany, that there were homosexuals that were taken to these camps.
[02:46:30.926 --> 02:46:33.328]  Now, I'm not for the persecution of homosexuals.
[02:46:33.368 --> 02:46:50.265]   What I'm telling you is, the government is drawing comparisons between anyone who dares to speak out against the lack of safety of women By these men dressing as women, who will never be a woman.
[02:46:50.365 --> 02:46:51.966]  It's not biologically possible.
[02:46:52.086 --> 02:46:54.207]  I don't care who I offend by saying that.
[02:46:55.368 --> 02:46:56.769]  These people are not safe.
[02:46:57.069 --> 02:47:02.151]  And anyone who dares to speak out against that is being labeled a right-wing extremist Nazi.
[02:47:03.432 --> 02:47:15.178]  A long time ago, we, you know, on this very broadcast, I spoke about the fact that these, the World Economic Forum, the WHO, they're calling anyone who disagrees with them an extremist, a terrorist.
[02:47:16.860 --> 02:47:18.742]  And this is prevalent in Australia.
[02:47:18.782 --> 02:47:32.455]  You know, 60 Minutes did a hit piece following this tragedy in Wembley, in Queensland, which again has so many questions, more questions raised than answers in that 60 Minutes report.
[02:47:32.615 --> 02:47:37.459]  And they just so happened to feature me on that report about domestic terrorism.
[02:47:38.060 --> 02:47:38.280]  Why?
[02:47:38.320 --> 02:47:39.782]  Because I'm not scared of you?
[02:47:39.822 --> 02:47:41.123]  Because I tell the truth?
[02:47:42.324 --> 02:47:47.568]  Because nothing you can do can shake me because I can't be bought or paid for?
[02:47:48.429 --> 02:47:49.370]  What a terrorist!
[02:47:51.191 --> 02:47:52.492]  It's disgraceful.
[02:47:52.532 --> 02:47:54.334]  But what is their solution to this?
[02:47:54.414 --> 02:48:08.725]  Well, you would recall that some time ago they wanted to bring in the Ministry of Truth to the United States, you know, very Orwellian, and they picked an absolute clown to represent this new Ministry of Truth.
[02:48:09.409 --> 02:48:15.754]  And it was going to be one person deciding for the country what was truth and what wasn't.
[02:48:16.694 --> 02:48:23.439]  That was promptly shut down and Biden's been trying to relaunch it since and Bill S-686 will definitely assist in that.
[02:48:24.500 --> 02:48:32.391]   But here in Australia, we have the world's first e-safety Commissioner that's been appointed.
[02:48:32.451 --> 02:48:34.214]  Her name is Julie Inman Grant.
[02:48:34.294 --> 02:48:41.985]  If the team could pull up the clip of Julie Inman Grant, actually the first clip, Zero Time, Julie Inman Grant.
[02:48:42.025 --> 02:48:47.072]  This is from our last week's show, Zero Time, where we actually discussed this person.
[02:48:47.944 --> 02:48:51.146]  Julie Inman Grant is Australia's eSafety Commissioner.
[02:48:51.846 --> 02:49:01.832]  According to the esafety.gov.au website, Julie leads the world's first government regulatory agency committed to keeping its citizens safer online.
[02:49:02.592 --> 02:49:14.259]  According to esafety.gov.au, Julie spent two decades working in senior public policy and safety roles in the tech industry at Microsoft, Twitter and Adobe, and her career began in Washington, D.C.
[02:49:16.479 --> 02:49:17.364]  Need we say more?
[02:49:18.371 --> 02:49:19.538]  Oh, but there is more to say!
[02:49:20.933 --> 02:49:32.844]  Julie also serves on the World Economic Forum's Global Coalition for Digital Safety and on their XR Ecosystem Governance Steering Committee on building and defining the metaverse.
[02:49:33.684 --> 02:49:46.076]  Under her leadership, eSafety has joined forces with the White House Gender Policy Council and Government of Denmark on the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Harassment and Abuse.
[02:49:48.339 --> 02:49:53.807]  Gender abuse certainly sounds like you'd have an interest in protecting women getting smashed by men.
[02:49:54.888 --> 02:49:55.590]  Apparently not.
[02:49:57.486 --> 02:50:07.916]  The Commissioner was recently named one of Australia's most influential women by the Australian Financial Review and a leading Australian in foreign affairs by the Sydney Morning Herald.
[02:50:08.497 --> 02:50:19.328]  In 2020, the World Economic Forum and Apolitical appointed the Commissioner as one of the Agile 50, the world's most influential leaders, revolutionising government.
[02:50:22.122 --> 02:50:27.666]  Alright, so there are multiple problems with so much of what we read out in that report.
[02:50:28.467 --> 02:50:47.339]   But I guess first and foremost, anyone aligned with the World Economic Forum, and this ties into the entire Twitter conversation that's happening now about Elon's decision for a new CEO, Linda Iaccarino, Who is, you know, a proud WEF puppet, essentially.
[02:50:47.419 --> 02:50:50.880]  And we don't want to judge her too early, a lot of people are saying.
[02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:53.261]  And I somewhat agree with that, but I also don't.
[02:50:53.301 --> 02:51:08.907]  Because anyone that comes, that has any form of association with the WEF, and is in agreement with anything that they say, and really anyone that was pro-vax and pro-mask, and hasn't come out now and said, hey, I was wrong.
[02:51:10.487 --> 02:51:12.328]  Is a danger to society.
[02:51:13.828 --> 02:51:18.109]  The World Economic Forum is a terrorist organization.
[02:51:19.210 --> 02:51:26.992]  They are indoctrinating people to go in and turn against their own citizens.
[02:51:27.953 --> 02:51:28.933]  That's terrorism.
[02:51:30.287 --> 02:51:34.870]  To turn against your own citizens is domestic terrorism.
[02:51:35.330 --> 02:51:37.151]  Let's flip this around on them.
[02:51:37.491 --> 02:51:39.112]  We're not the domestic terrorists.
[02:51:39.552 --> 02:51:45.616]  The ones who are facilitating an open border for an invasion.
[02:51:46.156 --> 02:51:54.881]  The ones who are facilitating drag queen story time to sexualize our children in line with the United Nations' satanic agenda.
[02:51:55.082 --> 02:51:55.422]  That!
[02:51:56.371 --> 02:51:57.893]  Is harming your own citizens.
[02:51:57.913 --> 02:51:59.535]  You are turning against your own people.
[02:51:59.856 --> 02:52:01.738]  That's the real domestic terrorism.
[02:52:01.778 --> 02:52:03.100]  And where does that thinking come from?
[02:52:03.400 --> 02:52:05.042]  It comes from the World Economic Forum.
[02:52:05.062 --> 02:52:10.709]  So anyone that comes from this organization is a danger to society.
[02:52:11.110 --> 02:52:12.552]  I am fully convinced of that.
[02:52:12.732 --> 02:52:14.314]  No one will convince me otherwise.
[02:52:14.694 --> 02:52:25.043]  And if you think that that's too much of a stretch, let me ask every single person that's listening to this, would you ever go to the World Economic Forum to just check it out and see if you want to be a part of this club?
[02:52:25.083 --> 02:52:27.906]  No, you wouldn't because these people are insane!
[02:52:29.424 --> 02:52:33.026]  Nothing that they stand for is for the betterment of humanity.
[02:52:33.307 --> 02:52:36.749]  It is for complete control and the destruction of humanity.
[02:52:36.989 --> 02:52:38.790]  They stand for depopulation.
[02:52:39.130 --> 02:52:41.071]  They stand for silencing speech.
[02:52:41.371 --> 02:52:44.553]  They stand for having sex with children.
[02:52:46.134 --> 02:52:54.439]  This is what the United Nations and the World Economic Forum and the WHO and any one of these people stand for.
[02:52:54.760 --> 02:52:58.622]  Would you ever go and be part of them just to be part of the conversation?
[02:53:00.157 --> 02:53:04.100]  Can you change these people's minds?
[02:53:04.120 --> 02:53:11.886]  Are you, you know, going to be more influential than Satan in their lives because that's who they worship?
[02:53:13.988 --> 02:53:28.833]   Now again, I won't judge too early, but I'm putting this out there because I have never seen one normal human being come out Of the Young Global Leaders Program or anything to do with the World Economic Forum.
[02:53:29.013 --> 02:53:34.555]  And this is why I'm telling you about this e-safety commissioner in Australia who we'll go on to talk about in a minute.
[02:53:34.935 --> 02:53:39.916]  It's relevant to everyone because they're going to implement this one arbiter of truth in every country.
[02:53:39.956 --> 02:53:42.277]  They already tried it in the United States, failed once.
[02:53:42.917 --> 02:53:46.118]  You can rest assured that they will try again.
[02:53:46.138 --> 02:53:48.239]  We'll keep going right after the break.
[02:53:48.259 --> 02:53:48.859]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:53:49.873 --> 02:53:51.636]  Imagine life without Infowars.
[02:53:52.076 --> 02:53:57.985]  Imagine life without independent media being able to give you the truth to tell you what's really going on in this world.
[02:53:58.326 --> 02:54:04.094]  Imagine only having the propaganda media like in 1984.
[02:54:05.638 --> 02:54:07.859]  Just spewing lies, spewing lies.
[02:54:08.259 --> 02:54:10.519]  Imagine all you heard was lies.
[02:54:10.779 --> 02:54:12.260]  It would be absolute hell on earth.
[02:54:12.320 --> 02:54:15.981]  The truth is such a precious, precious thing that we have.
[02:54:16.041 --> 02:54:19.441]  So please, I'm asking everyone that's listening and watching this, do support InfoWars.
[02:54:19.742 --> 02:54:21.642]  Go and get a product, go and get a t-shirt today.
[02:54:21.662 --> 02:54:25.383]  It is so, so vital to keep broadcasts like this on the air.
[02:54:25.863 --> 02:54:31.186]  Now, I want to go back to this e-safety commissioner because it is really coming to every single country.
[02:54:31.226 --> 02:54:32.726]  They're trying it here in Australia first.
[02:54:33.287 --> 02:54:47.033]  It says here, you know, she's joined forces or e-safety has joined forces with the White House Gender Policy Council and Government of Denmark on the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Harassment and Abuse.
[02:54:47.093 --> 02:55:05.712]   Now, first of all, The White House Gender Policy Council, we're talking about the White House that literally hired a diversity hire, Sam Brinton, just because he has a moustache and dresses like a woman, with very limited experience, as their nuclear waste expert.
[02:55:07.033 --> 02:55:08.174]  And he's a baggage thief.
[02:55:09.895 --> 02:55:17.041]  So we're using the White House here as, you know, to back up Julie's credentials.
[02:55:18.835 --> 02:55:23.065]  The White House that employs a luggage thief just because he's trans.
[02:55:23.707 --> 02:55:26.032]  I mean, you know what I mean?
[02:55:26.052 --> 02:55:28.879]  Do I need to spell it out any clearer for everyone?
[02:55:29.844 --> 02:55:34.328]  But this eSafety, they talk about action on gender-based harassment and abuse.
[02:55:34.368 --> 02:55:37.571]  So, you know, all these people are now worried about Julie Inman Grant.
[02:55:37.951 --> 02:55:40.513]  What are you going to be doing to police speech?
[02:55:40.553 --> 02:55:47.440]  Well, if the team can pull up the video of Julie Inman Grant, it's called Julie Inman Grant, W-E-F.
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:50.142]  Take a look at this and what she has to say about policing speech.
[02:55:51.092 --> 02:56:06.378]  It's important to point out that we're not policing the internet for harmful material, that we actually rely on citizens to collect evidence to report to the platform first, and then report to us if seriously harmful content isn't taken down.
[02:56:06.838 --> 02:56:12.181]  So we were really set up as a safety net when some of this falls through the cracks.
[02:56:12.461 --> 02:56:15.602]  We're not seeking to become the content moderators ourselves.
[02:56:16.242 --> 02:56:19.324]  You know, we believe that the platforms build the digital roads.
[02:56:19.404 --> 02:56:25.667]  They also need to erect the digital guardrails and the safety guardrails and be, you know, applying the virtual seatbelts.
[02:56:28.346 --> 02:56:29.887]  Applying the virtual seatbelts.
[02:56:29.927 --> 02:56:33.450]  And of course it won't be the one arbiter of truth coming after you.
[02:56:33.951 --> 02:56:36.733]  You know, she's not policing it, eSafety's not policing it.
[02:56:37.413 --> 02:56:41.356]  They're just going to enforce social media platforms to police it.
[02:56:41.737 --> 02:56:47.942]  Except when you look at the eSafety report and some of our online safety laws, that's absolutely not the case.
[02:56:48.122 --> 02:56:54.507]  And we actually have an example of the flexing of their powers that's already occurred.
[02:56:55.441 --> 02:56:58.523]  There was an activist in Australia who spoke out.
[02:56:58.663 --> 02:57:12.892]  She's from an organization that works to protect children from the pedophile agenda that lies underneath the trans agenda, and protect women as well, because she believes in protecting women.
[02:57:13.332 --> 02:57:14.533]  That's a great thing, isn't it?
[02:57:14.813 --> 02:57:18.776]  That's what all these people believe in, all these people that are working on gender equality.
[02:57:18.796 --> 02:57:19.797]  We want to protect women.
[02:57:19.877 --> 02:57:24.920]  Okay, how about we protect them from being smashed in women's sports, because that's exactly what happened.
[02:57:25.606 --> 02:57:35.051]  In February, this particular activist that I'm talking about, who we can't even talk about because there's a court order not to talk about this situation.
[02:57:35.591 --> 02:57:36.531]  And who was involved?
[02:57:36.571 --> 02:57:40.213]  Julie Inman Grant, who's not personally policing social media, apparently.
[02:57:41.034 --> 02:57:51.879]  So this activist spoke about this dude that previously was a viral YouTuber that said, if you're not sexually attracted to trans people, you're transphobic.
[02:57:53.197 --> 02:58:05.700]  Who, as far as I'm aware, isn't a professional footballer, decided overnight to join women's football, injured three women on the field, one to the point of hospitalisation.
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:10.441]  So this activist spoke up about it and said, this is so wrong.
[02:58:10.481 --> 02:58:11.801]  These women are in danger.
[02:58:11.841 --> 02:58:13.982]  We need to protect women in women's sports.
[02:58:14.322 --> 02:58:24.171]   Men are physically Regardless of how you dress up and what hormones you take, you have a higher bone density, more muscle mass.
[02:58:24.271 --> 02:58:36.475]  I don't need to list all of the advantages that biological men will always have over biological women, no matter how they butcher their bodies and how many dresses they put on.
[02:58:38.846 --> 02:58:40.908]  And so one of these women ended up in hospital.
[02:58:40.948 --> 02:58:42.589]  So this activist spoke up about it.
[02:58:42.629 --> 02:58:53.437]  Julie Inman Grant herself, according to reports, has gone after this one woman who's talking about women being abused physically by men in women's sports.
[02:58:55.154 --> 02:59:03.019]  So they say they're not personally policing, they say that it's just about, you know, strengthening online safety, and then they come after these people.
[02:59:03.399 --> 02:59:16.888]  So now this activist who lives, I think, over, if I'm not mistaken, at least 200 kilometres away from this dude posing as a woman in sports, she's been given an apprehended violence order.
[02:59:17.572 --> 02:59:18.772]  She can't go near him.
[02:59:18.812 --> 02:59:22.374]  She doesn't live anywhere near him, never called for any violence against him.
[02:59:22.654 --> 02:59:28.836]  She's been issued with an apprehended violence order because she's spoken about the risks to these women on the field.
[02:59:29.656 --> 02:59:35.438]  And Julianne McGrann, according to reports, was personally responsible for shutting down this woman's social media.
[02:59:36.558 --> 02:59:40.019]  Hey, if I disappear off social media, you know where to look.
[02:59:41.238 --> 02:59:54.823]  So, you know, over 47,000 followers on Facebook, and again, according to reports, this one person, this one arbiter of truth, Julie Inman Grant, was responsible for taking down this activist from Facebook.
[02:59:56.084 --> 02:59:59.745]  So that brings us to the new Twitter CEO.
[03:00:01.406 --> 03:00:08.161]   You know, you see people like Julie aligned With the WEF and the thinking that they have.
[03:00:08.581 --> 03:00:15.063]  And the Twitter files showed us just how far, you know, the left will go.
[03:00:15.083 --> 03:00:22.044]  That's just people that are indoctrinated by the thing of the day.
[03:00:22.604 --> 03:00:26.164]  What about people that have been through years of indoctrination by the WEF?
[03:00:27.205 --> 03:00:39.926]   What about people that have sat in their meetings and participated in the discussions about the future and hacking the human brain and Making sure that we address extremism and gender equality.
[03:00:42.388 --> 03:00:54.973]  Let me tell you, as a woman, I have never felt more attacked than I do now by all these men claiming that they're women.
[03:00:55.985 --> 03:01:04.108]  And diminishing what it is to be a woman just because, what, they got some plastic surgery and, you know, they're flaunting their chest.
[03:01:04.168 --> 03:01:05.688]  I mean, now they're not even doing that.
[03:01:06.249 --> 03:01:12.471]  They're coming out with, you know, beards, these big burly dudes with beards saying, I'm a woman.
[03:01:12.491 --> 03:01:14.752]  It is so offensive.
[03:01:15.012 --> 03:01:19.253]  I have never been under so much attack as a woman than I am today.
[03:01:19.273 --> 03:01:23.975]  But there's no logic with these people.
[03:01:25.521 --> 03:01:29.988]  And so they're coming after anyone who dares to speak sense.
[03:01:32.271 --> 03:01:39.082]  So I am very concerned about this WEF-aligned Twitter CEO, as should everyone be.
[03:01:39.222 --> 03:01:39.923]  Everyone should be.
[03:01:40.755 --> 03:01:43.536]  So I just really quickly want to touch on this e-safety strategy.
[03:01:43.696 --> 03:01:49.857]  You know, they're supposed to protect people from online harms that depict sexual exploitation of children.
[03:01:50.378 --> 03:02:06.205]   And I referenced this United Nations report in line with, in conjunction, sorry, with the International Commission of Jurists, which calls for decriminalizing sex with minors.
[03:02:06.266 --> 03:02:06.966]  It actually does.
[03:02:08.086 --> 03:02:16.330]  And it says that sexual conduct involving persons below the domestically prescribed minimum age of consent to sex may be consensual, in fact, if not in law.
[03:02:17.963 --> 03:02:25.988]  And it talks about letting persons under the age of 18 make decisions about engaging in consensual sexual conduct.
[03:02:26.288 --> 03:02:27.909]  This is endorsed by the United Nations.
[03:02:27.949 --> 03:02:36.695]  The report is called the 8 March Principles for a Human Rights Based Approach to Criminal Law Prescribing Conduct Associated with Sex, Reproduction, Drug Use, HIV, Homelessness and Poverty.
[03:02:36.735 --> 03:02:40.238]   So my question was, okay, these arbiters Of truth?
[03:02:40.298 --> 03:02:52.228]  Are they coming out and saying, hey guys, we need to exit the United Nations and anyone associated with them because they're calling about, you know, making old men having sex with your children legal now.
[03:02:52.849 --> 03:02:53.950]  Have any of them said this?
[03:02:55.131 --> 03:02:55.811]  No, they haven't.
[03:02:56.552 --> 03:02:57.473]  Because they want this.
[03:02:57.553 --> 03:02:58.734]  They want this depravity.
[03:02:59.801 --> 03:03:09.267]  And anyone who's been through the WEF Global Leader Training will want this depravity because they're depraved maniacs.
[03:03:12.289 --> 03:03:20.074]  So this, you know, this e-safety report talks about keeping people safe from things that they find harmful or offensive.
[03:03:20.134 --> 03:03:25.578]  And in today's snowflake society, everyone finds something harmful or offensive.
[03:03:25.618 --> 03:03:27.359]  No one can even take a joke these days.
[03:03:28.652 --> 03:03:36.198]  So you can see this report calls for what they call regulation of illegal and restricted content, no matter where it's hosted.
[03:03:36.598 --> 03:03:42.122]  We're almost out of time today, so I encourage everyone to go back and look at our latest Zero Time report.
[03:03:42.142 --> 03:03:43.183]  It's on zmedia.com.
[03:03:43.223 --> 03:03:44.064]  It's also on Banned.
[03:03:44.544 --> 03:03:50.028]  It details all of this, and the reason why it's important to every country is because it's coming to you.
[03:03:50.048 --> 03:03:52.670]  Ireland's just passed similar laws.
[03:03:53.130 --> 03:03:54.632]  Online Safety Act in Australia.
[03:03:54.652 --> 03:03:55.092]  C11 in Canada.
[03:03:57.253 --> 03:04:00.836]  Bill 6S 686 in the United States.
[03:04:02.198 --> 03:04:04.380]  Digital safety in the EU.
[03:04:04.640 --> 03:04:15.951]  Every single country is operating in lockstep right now to silence this very broadcast, to silence this very conversation, which is why your support of independent media is so important.
[03:04:16.011 --> 03:04:17.392]  Share this information everywhere.
[03:04:17.853 --> 03:04:19.054]  Thank you for joining me today.
[03:04:19.094 --> 03:04:20.835]  It's been an honour to be here with you.
[03:04:20.674 --> 03:04:34.033]  you. God bless.
[03:04:34.033 --> 03:04:36.613]  (upbeat music)
[03:04:35.228 --> 03:04:40.409]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:04:41.650 --> 03:04:45.110]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[03:04:45.431 --> 03:04:48.952]  This is The War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[03:04:50.272 --> 03:04:52.052]  Please stand by for further details.
[03:04:52.292 --> 03:04:54.313]  We return you now to your regularly scheduled program.
[03:04:57.563 --> 03:05:04.387]  So, Gen Z workers are not going to be faring too well in the workplace, and that doesn't spell good for us in the future.
[03:05:04.527 --> 03:05:11.411]  One thing I could recommend is I think we need to get some of these Gen Zers on TurboForce, which you can get at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:05:11.431 --> 03:05:12.891]  Didn't see the plug coming, did you?

[03:05:23.857 --> 03:05:24.638]  You want half a scoop?

[03:05:48.525 --> 03:05:51.447]  Just some of the ingredients packed into Turbo Force.
[03:05:51.447 --> 03:05:52.766]  It's in a powder form.
[03:05:52.766 --> 03:05:53.766]  It's in a canister.
[03:05:53.766 --> 03:05:55.967]  You saw the commercial earlier.
[03:05:55.967 --> 03:05:57.806]  People were fighting over the last little bag.
[03:05:57.806 --> 03:05:58.926]  They don't even know.
[03:05:58.926 --> 03:06:00.246]  We got it now in a canister.
[03:06:00.246 --> 03:06:03.806]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com and pick up your Turbo Force.
[03:06:03.806 --> 03:06:05.806]  I don't know what you're waiting for.
[03:06:05.882 --> 03:06:08.285]  And that's my really my only plug today.
[03:06:08.305 --> 03:06:08.986]  I feel bad.
[03:06:09.026 --> 03:06:13.171]  I forgot to do it all throughout because we had so much information going on an amazing interview.
[03:06:13.591 --> 03:06:15.193]  But we got another amazing interview.
[03:06:15.273 --> 03:06:17.796]  Infowarsstore.com and support what we're doing.
[03:06:17.915 --> 03:06:23.115]   It's you out there that fuel the jet engines that keep this whole thing twirling about.
[03:06:23.115 --> 03:06:28.115]  [MUSIC]
[03:06:28.115 --> 03:06:33.115]  It's been said that my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[03:06:33.113 --> 03:06:35.454]  When Christ said that, we know it's totally true.
[03:06:36.095 --> 03:06:36.815]  Knowledge is power.
[03:06:37.395 --> 03:06:40.256]  It's also been said that God helps those that help themselves.
[03:06:41.317 --> 03:06:45.299]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's time to help yourself and help your family and help your community.
[03:06:46.403 --> 03:06:59.794]  If you research the iodine conspiracy and discover that in the US and in China and many other countries, IQs were dropping, deformities were exploding, the 20s and 30s and 40s, so the governments put iodine in the food.
[03:07:00.214 --> 03:07:11.822]   Not high quality iodine, it was still bound iodine to other elements, it was really cheap iodine, but it boosted IQs, knocked out the infertility, Really did great things to stop a lot of the mutations and deformities.
[03:07:12.162 --> 03:07:12.963]  Look it up for yourself.
[03:07:13.303 --> 03:07:22.048]  Just look up the iodine deficiency on Wikipedia and it's got all the links to the UN, the Lancet Medical Journal, everything about the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world.
[03:07:22.068 --> 03:07:24.510]  The number one cause of intellectual disability.
[03:07:24.770 --> 03:07:36.171]   The number one cause of all these different health problems is lack of iodine and how These bad halogens that counter and block iodine are purposely putting the food in water.
[03:07:36.371 --> 03:07:37.392]  They even admit that here.
[03:07:37.933 --> 03:07:42.878]  And then we wonder why people are so dumb and why society is falling apart all around us.
[03:07:43.539 --> 03:07:47.544]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the cleanest, best, highest quality iodine.
[03:07:48.004 --> 03:07:58.070]  We have all three types, the nascent, deep-earth crystal, pure atomic iodine, and then two other types that help synergistically boost that, according to the experts that we did the research with.
[03:07:58.590 --> 03:08:05.634]  This product's been sold out for more than six months, but it's finally back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:08:08.055 --> 03:08:15.923]  But whatever you do, please look into the iodine deficiency, please research it for yourself, and please find out how important it is.
[03:08:16.163 --> 03:08:19.086]  Because no one else has this iodine that we have.
[03:08:19.246 --> 03:08:24.551]  But some Himalayan salts, that are billions of years old, do actually have the triiodine in it.
[03:08:24.871 --> 03:08:26.273]  So wherever you get it, get it now.
