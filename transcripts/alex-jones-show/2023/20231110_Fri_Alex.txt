[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.933]  It's going to get worse and worse and worse, and they're going to have political assassinations everywhere.
[00:00:05.414 --> 00:00:11.699]  They're shooting and stabbing and poisoning people from Australia to Spain, from Sweden to Germany to England.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.884]  They're shooting leading populist leaders that are winning in the polls in the face.
[00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:19.526]  They're injecting them with poison on TV.
[00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:22.432]  None of the leftists are getting charged.
[00:00:23.172 --> 00:00:24.872]  They have a green light to murder us.
[00:00:25.613 --> 00:00:27.053]  They're attacking railways.
[00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:28.734]  They're attacking food production plants.
[00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:30.174]  They're attacking oil drilling rigs.
[00:00:30.454 --> 00:00:32.115]  They're attacking 18-wheeler drivers.
[00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:38.137]  They are just running around, burning things down and blowing things up and running police over.
[00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:39.597]  And this is just the start.
[00:00:39.657 --> 00:00:40.918]  This is the French Revolution.
[00:00:41.678 --> 00:00:41.979]  Times 10.
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.945]  This is the French Revolution to the 10th power.
[00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:46.789]  This is Satanism.
[00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:48.111]  This is New World Order.
[00:00:48.392 --> 00:00:49.775]  This is Katie bar the door.
[00:00:49.995 --> 00:00:52.500]  This is open devil worship, open pedophilia.
[00:00:53.905 --> 00:01:04.197]  This is going to be plunging currencies, exploding massive, massive inflation, massive wars, probably nuclear.
[00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:13.267]  I mean, it's just going to be all these evil people that think they can be evil and do all this, that they're destabilizing the world to bring in their control, are bringing in something that's going to destroy them.
[00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:22.976]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:34.886]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:41.772]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:01:41.912 --> 00:01:44.034]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:01:45.988 --> 00:01:50.988]   From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:50.988 --> 00:02:11.988]  [Music]
[00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:14.492]  People that are boys... And I don't know what that is.
[00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:15.733]  I've never seen one of those before.
[00:02:15.793 --> 00:02:20.476]  People whose gender might be a little bit of both or might even be neither.
[00:02:21.157 --> 00:02:24.139]  Some public schools and libraries invite drag queens.
[00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:28.582]  Some dress like torn demons to read to young children.
[00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:32.484]  Parents' rights are limited, and children's rights are put ahead.
[00:02:32.904 --> 00:02:37.667]  So the child has the right to be protected from the parents when the parents behave badly.
[00:02:37.687 --> 00:02:43.971]  Yeah, that child molester just messed with the wrong preschooler.
[00:02:45.492 --> 00:02:47.333]  What makes you think he's a child molester?
[00:02:47.914 --> 00:02:49.534]  Oh, he's a child molester, believe me.
[00:02:49.975 --> 00:02:53.575]  Every child molester I've ever met looks just like that.
[00:02:53.575 --> 00:02:57.175]  And make gay little babies for the whole human race.
[00:02:57.175 --> 00:02:58.775]  Make a world we can live in.
[00:02:58.775 --> 00:03:01.574]  We're the one who you love's not an issue.
[00:03:02.378 --> 00:03:04.378]  We'll convert your children.
[00:03:04.378 --> 00:03:04.878]  What?
[00:03:04.878 --> 00:03:12.618]   Happens bit by bit, quietly and subtly, and you will barely notice it.
[00:03:12.618 --> 00:03:20.618]   You can keep him from disco, warn about San Francisco, make him wear faded pants, we don't care.
[00:03:20.618 --> 00:03:26.618]   And then you have talk show stars like Joe Rogan who just wing it, who make it up as they go along.
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:36.428]  And because figures like Rogan are trusted by people that don't trust real newsrooms, we have a tension, a problem that's much bigger than Spotify, much bigger than any single platform, Kate.
[00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:41.272]  But that's what's at the heart of this r- Dammit, everything on TV sucks.
[00:03:42.073 --> 00:03:44.073]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:03:44.073 --> 00:03:45.512]  Oh.

[00:04:14.731 --> 00:04:15.312]  You piece of shit!
[00:04:15.352 --> 00:04:17.613]  You fucking fucking damn fucker!
[00:04:18.053 --> 00:04:18.973]  Listen, fuckhead!

[00:04:41.813 --> 00:04:48.837]  Uh... I... We're... Uh... Whoa!
[00:04:49.537 --> 00:04:52.279]  I just got invited to give the commencement address at Harvard this year.
[00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:53.440]  That's amazing!
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.940]  I'm gay!
[00:04:55.401 --> 00:05:09.573]   *outro* Alright.
[00:05:09.593 --> 00:05:11.755]  Do you guys wear the hat and everything?
[00:05:11.855 --> 00:05:13.316]  Hi, who's that?
[00:05:13.416 --> 00:05:15.858]  Don't worry.
[00:05:15.718 --> 00:05:16.218]  Hello?
[00:05:16.218 --> 00:05:19.218]   *Squeal* *Squeal*

[00:05:25.572 --> 00:05:26.913]  You are my enemy!
[00:05:27.413 --> 00:05:28.394]  You will pay.
[00:05:28.434 --> 00:05:30.115]  Yeah, you think I don't see your face, scum?
[00:05:30.135 --> 00:05:31.576]  You don't think I don't see you?
[00:05:32.096 --> 00:05:32.517]  I see you.
[00:05:32.557 --> 00:05:33.918]  You understand me?
[00:05:34.018 --> 00:05:36.099]  I know what you think of me and my family.
[00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:36.820]  I see you.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.420]  Right back.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.061]  You don't understand that.
[00:05:38.901 --> 00:05:40.901]  Damn it.
[00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:47.901]  You will fall!
[00:05:47.901 --> 00:05:49.901]  You will not bring humanity down!

[00:06:09.157 --> 00:06:12.595]   Infowars.com Tomorrow's news today.
[00:06:13.636 --> 00:06:16.337]  Infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:06:16.917 --> 00:06:19.158]  Break the back of the globalist or roll over and die.
[00:06:19.418 --> 00:06:20.039]  We're live.
[00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:21.299]  Friday, November 10th, 2023.
[00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:22.099]  Stay with us.
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:37.727]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, things were already in focus, but now they are in crystal clear electron microscope focus.
[00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:44.580]  Thank you for joining us on this live Friday, November 10, 2023 transmission.
[00:06:46.021 --> 00:06:59.664]  I had cleared the deck of guests today because I wanted to cover news and take your calls, and I'm still going to do that, but I saw a Laura Loomer story that's just illustrative of everything we're dealing with, with this New York kangaroo court where the judge has already found Trump guilty.
[00:06:59.704 --> 00:07:00.584]  There is no jury.
[00:07:01.144 --> 00:07:02.805]  That's the new format of their tyranny.
[00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:06.437]  And it's clearly the judge's wife's Twitter.
[00:07:06.477 --> 00:07:11.760]  I went and checked archives, and she's going around attacking people all over the place and attacking Trump.
[00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:16.743]  And when this got raised by Laura Loomer, the woman came out and said it's not her.
[00:07:18.804 --> 00:07:24.607]  But then when Laura Loomer goes on other shows in the comment sections, it's the same lady, it appears, doing it.
[00:07:24.707 --> 00:07:25.747]  And it's just insane.
[00:07:26.068 --> 00:07:27.969]  This is the same judge gagging Trump.
[00:07:28.922 --> 00:07:35.345]  From criticizing anything going on in the courtroom while they attack him and do press conferences every day with Letitia James.
[00:07:35.885 --> 00:07:42.027]  Now if you're a TV viewer, we're on a lot of radio stations as well, you notice I have all the lights off in here other than the lights on me and the desk.
[00:07:42.767 --> 00:07:43.808]  The background's all dark.
[00:07:44.868 --> 00:07:47.349]  And that's illustrative of really a very important story here.
[00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.451]  And I'll just let the chips fall where they may and then I'm going to get into all of this news.
[00:07:52.711 --> 00:07:56.593]  There is a big story on Infowars.com by the great Ben Warren.
[00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.190]  What a hard-working, smart guy.
[00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.710]  Love him.
[00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:00.451]  Love everybody here.
[00:08:00.951 --> 00:08:01.411]  The U.S.
[00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:03.051]  has lost its first world status.
[00:08:03.071 --> 00:08:03.952]  So very important.
[00:08:06.812 --> 00:08:07.552]  Lengthy article.
[00:08:07.712 --> 00:08:09.793]  Not too lengthy that everybody should read and share.
[00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.334]  Because this is being done by design.
[00:08:12.374 --> 00:08:13.634]  This is the post-industrial world.
[00:08:14.534 --> 00:08:17.615]  We're going to be getting into that today.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:29.711]  Also, I've got scores of videos of police in the United States, Canada, Europe being murdered.
[00:08:31.264 --> 00:08:32.985]  And it's obviously a race war.
[00:08:33.785 --> 00:08:38.026]  It's black people murdering police with knives, guns, and automobiles.
[00:08:38.827 --> 00:08:40.447]  And then it never even hits the national news.
[00:08:40.547 --> 00:08:41.988]  And look, I'm not attacking black people.
[00:08:42.268 --> 00:08:43.468]  Most black people are great folks.
[00:08:44.028 --> 00:08:52.971]  But there is a subset of young black males who literally believe the news that white people are inherently the devil that the ADL teaches.
[00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:54.952]  You got white people killing white people too.
[00:08:55.692 --> 00:09:03.419]  Because they deserve to die according to the left and Black Lives Matter like the woman who thought she was a man in Nashville and all the attempts to suppress that manifesto.
[00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:35.398]   So I usually don't play these clips just because I've already watched them once and everybody knows this is going on but there was one today that's up on Infowars.com where it's police responding to a house call and then you see a black man in a car Ram the police, cut the cop's legs off, smashes him into the police Tahoe, and then he gets out going, like he's a demon approaching him, and they taser him.
[00:09:35.418 --> 00:09:38.441]  Because the cops are so afraid to defend themselves.
[00:09:39.081 --> 00:09:40.823]  See, I shouldn't be a cop, at least not today.
[00:09:40.843 --> 00:09:46.008]  I don't care if you're black or white, you just, on purpose, cut somebody's legs off and get out.
[00:09:47.059 --> 00:09:47.639]  Like a zombie?
[00:09:47.959 --> 00:09:56.083]  And I saw a video just a few days ago of a white lady hitting the face of black people at a grocery store, and she was doing the same.
[00:09:58.444 --> 00:10:01.005]  With the same demonic face, bearing her teeth.
[00:10:02.045 --> 00:10:02.826]  Call it what you want.
[00:10:02.866 --> 00:10:04.466]  Demonic possession, insanity.
[00:10:05.967 --> 00:10:08.948]  It's going on everywhere.
[00:10:09.328 --> 00:10:10.949]  And white people are starting to crack.
[00:10:11.189 --> 00:10:12.950]  We're starting white supremacy.
[00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.391]  Any white person doing anything to somebody that's not white.
[00:10:17.077 --> 00:10:20.618]  Those numbers are low, but they are starting to tick up and a lot of white people are going to crack too.
[00:10:21.438 --> 00:10:24.178]  So they are really trying to get us all killing each other.
[00:10:24.198 --> 00:10:28.459]  It is completely and absolutely out of control.
[00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:32.440]  And the numbers are insane, but the measures have been sent.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.140]  Killing cops is a good thing.
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.461]  And it's just getting more and more and more intense.
[00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:45.622]  We have massive news with Joe Biden to meet Xi Jinping in the collapsed city of San Francisco.
[00:10:46.616 --> 00:10:48.697]  We're going to be getting into all of that.
[00:10:48.797 --> 00:10:51.679]  No possibility of Gaza ceasefire, says Biden.
[00:10:52.699 --> 00:10:54.460]  Huge war news.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:11:00.623]  Pentagon starting to restrict flow of military aid to Ukraine.
[00:11:02.064 --> 00:11:02.765]  Here's another one.
[00:11:02.825 --> 00:11:07.367]  Poland holds up Ukraine's EU membership based on Ukrainian World War II atrocities.
[00:11:08.087 --> 00:11:16.061]   Oh, you mean like Zelensky honoring the SS officer that actually did carry out Death camp and mass extermination operations.
[00:11:16.662 --> 00:11:18.182]  Hard to believe those guys are still alive.
[00:11:18.222 --> 00:11:18.542]  They are.
[00:11:19.023 --> 00:11:22.264]  But you won't have the Simon Wiesenthal Center trying to extradite him to Israel.
[00:11:22.864 --> 00:11:23.185]  No, no, no.
[00:11:23.245 --> 00:11:28.107]  Real Nazis get ADL awards like George Soros and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:11:28.967 --> 00:11:30.808]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[00:11:31.789 --> 00:11:37.951]  The EU is officially launching the digital, programmable, controllable, mark of the beast currency like China has done.
[00:11:38.592 --> 00:11:41.333]  Got big reports on that.
[00:11:44.144 --> 00:11:51.368]  We also have a huge caravan of military age men surging over the border, chanting Biden, Biden, Biden, Biden.
[00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.231]  We're going to be getting to all of it here today.
[00:11:59.713 --> 00:12:02.095]  But I want to address something to the crew.
[00:12:03.276 --> 00:12:12.161]  I want to address something to the CIA and the Justice Department and to our listeners and viewers and to the Democratic Party and just to everybody else out there.
[00:12:13.243 --> 00:12:14.523]  And I'm going to spend some time on this.
[00:12:14.543 --> 00:12:16.264]  I'm going to move into the news and take your calls.
[00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:29.246]  They know when they fired Tucker Carlson off Fox News, he went from 5 million viewers a night on TV, on cable, and 3 or 4 million views a day online.
[00:12:29.646 --> 00:12:30.466]  I'm a big fan.
[00:12:30.506 --> 00:12:31.066]  I monitor it.
[00:12:31.986 --> 00:12:33.767]  He's reaching less than 10 million people a day.
[00:12:33.867 --> 00:12:34.447]  Doing a great job.
[00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:40.488]  When they unceremoniously fired him, he got 10 times bigger.
[00:12:41.786 --> 00:13:04.957]  Now, they want to either indict me, or kill me, and because I own and control, until now, this operation that's 29 years old, Infowars is 27, that name, and they want to make it look like I've quit.
[00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:07.289]  But that's not what's going on.
[00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:18.834]  So I want to explain this to everybody, just give you a status update on InfoWars and where things are going and what's happened, and just explain to you that I've been put in an impossible, untenable position.
[00:13:19.993 --> 00:13:24.153]   The federal court said a year ago, and I declared bankruptcy a year ago plus,
[00:13:24.153 --> 00:13:28.313]   when the court believed the statements by the Democrat party law firms that I had hundreds
[00:13:28.313 --> 00:13:34.873]   of millions of dollars, that I made $62 million in 2021, total lies.
[00:13:34.873 --> 00:13:42.393]  And that I was just Daddy Warbucks.
[00:13:42.591 --> 00:13:46.617]  The judge said, fine, Mr. Jones can pay half the legal fees.
[00:13:46.937 --> 00:13:48.660]  His personal, I pay all those.
[00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:51.845]  And then half the free speech system's legal fees.
[00:13:52.745 --> 00:13:56.086]  In the year I declared bankruptcy, I got a huge Bitcoin donation.
[00:13:56.106 --> 00:13:58.207]  We wouldn't be on air now without it.
[00:13:58.227 --> 00:14:03.628]  I told On The Stand in Connecticut last year, I said, I think I'm giving about 95% of that to free speech.
[00:14:03.648 --> 00:14:05.309]  It was donated to me, but I want to keep this on air.
[00:14:05.649 --> 00:14:06.269]  That's my mission.
[00:14:06.289 --> 00:14:10.970]  I don't have solicitors for money and support and then sit there and pocket a large amount of it.
[00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:14.131]  I mean, I try to live comfortably and have a lot of expenses and issues.
[00:14:14.971 --> 00:14:17.472]  But a very small amount of money that comes through here is gone to me.
[00:14:18.928 --> 00:14:22.150]  And then I'd also bought a house as an investment as backup, and I was smart.
[00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:32.957]  It doubled, no, no, no, almost tripled in price in five years, and I sold it and put all the money into the operation and the legal fees.
[00:14:33.657 --> 00:14:34.517]  Did that last year.
[00:14:35.898 --> 00:14:42.302]  Now, I told you that the Democrat Party law firm suing me in bankruptcy have spent $21 million.
[00:14:42.903 --> 00:14:43.843]  I said that about a month ago.
[00:14:44.263 --> 00:14:45.064]  I was wrong, excuse me.
[00:14:46.328 --> 00:14:54.035]  This year, it's now $22 million, but bankruptcy was going for free speech six months before that last year, and I was paying for that too.
[00:14:54.696 --> 00:15:06.826]  So I've spent $7 million, and then put the rest of the money in to prop up free speech.
[00:15:06.886 --> 00:15:08.528]  So I've put in $10 million.
[00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:37.607]   Everything I had in that donation, because everything I have is a couple million in the donation, And the other side has spent, because I was looking at the numbers yesterday with the legal teams and the accountants, they have spent, that we know of, because you have to tell the court, during the bankruptcy, $34 million trying to shut us down and trying to weigh us down and trying to depose hundreds of people and, you know, engage in all this harassment.
[00:15:38.727 --> 00:15:57.811]   So, our $7-8 million that you supported us with, and I was a good steward with, I didn't even live in the house that I got that wasn't completed and fixed up and then sold and I bought it for what two million something sold it for seven million and it was just put back in which was a total pleasure.
[00:15:58.892 --> 00:16:04.555]  I mean that this is what I mean I'm ready to die for this I'm ready for them to kill me I mean I don't want to be killed but that's nothing.
[00:16:06.576 --> 00:16:13.859]   But now 20 plus million this year and I have a lake house that will sell for less than a million.
[00:16:13.899 --> 00:16:14.579]  It's on the market.
[00:16:14.819 --> 00:16:15.559]  It's a bad market.
[00:16:16.019 --> 00:16:17.220]  It's about to lower the price.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:23.862]  And even when I do that, I will be $2 million in the hole, and this thing is ongoing.
[00:16:25.762 --> 00:16:27.543]  So that's where this is.
[00:16:27.623 --> 00:16:33.265]  Free speech is making enough money to operate, but I don't have any more money.
[00:16:35.545 --> 00:16:38.686]  And you can say, well, go tell the court to change this.
[00:16:43.456 --> 00:16:48.858]  I mean, I guess that's the move we're going to try to have to make, but then even free speech doesn't have a bunch of extra money to pay for that.
[00:16:48.878 --> 00:16:54.801]  So we've been, they've been spending four to one, five to one against us.
[00:16:56.121 --> 00:17:25.055]   And we've kept the operation going and we've stayed on air this long, but we enter the wheelhouse here where Everything I bring in, when you hear, oh Alex Jones has a $1,400,000 a year contract that I've still not been paid, and then I'll put all that in and have no money, and then still owe money, and sell the lake house and have no money.
[00:17:25.075 --> 00:17:26.275]  It's a little bitty lake house.
[00:17:26.556 --> 00:17:29.317]  So it's not like the other house I bought that was a great investment.
[00:17:30.728 --> 00:17:33.290]  Because I had like, you know, a couple million dollars in the bank as emergency backup.
[00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:39.694]  And I said, well, you know, guy I know that's one of the, he is the best realtor in Austin, Elon Musk realtor, big listener.
[00:17:40.635 --> 00:17:43.197]  And he said, hey, this thing isn't even on the market yet.
[00:17:43.217 --> 00:17:44.238]  This guy hasn't finished it.
[00:17:44.658 --> 00:17:46.079]  Oh, he's like a hundred grand to finish it.
[00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:49.341]  He goes, in this market, he goes, in two years, I bet you double your money.
[00:17:49.421 --> 00:17:49.982]  I'm a friend.
[00:17:50.002 --> 00:17:51.843]  I'm going to get you.
[00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:52.704]  It never went on the market.
[00:17:52.744 --> 00:17:53.984]  I bought the house before it went on the market.
[00:17:54.004 --> 00:17:54.965]  And the guy told the truth.
[00:17:55.305 --> 00:17:55.906]  Almost tripled.
[00:17:57.882 --> 00:18:08.027]  But I did that because, again, that was not going to put emergency backup $2 million in the bank, and then when we have to use it, you know, you get like $2,050,000, you know, from the interest you get, like $50,000.
[00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:13.350]  So I've been a good steward overall, or as best I could be.
[00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:14.370]  I'm out of bullets.
[00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.611]  It's like the Alamo.
[00:18:16.632 --> 00:18:23.315]  They held off, you know, 5,000 troops, 80-something men for days and days, but when the ammo ran out, folks, they all got killed.
[00:18:24.531 --> 00:18:26.472]  And so it's real simple.
[00:18:26.912 --> 00:18:28.173]  And I actually feel good about this.
[00:18:28.953 --> 00:18:29.953]  I've never sold out.
[00:18:30.033 --> 00:18:31.014]  I've never backed down.
[00:18:31.134 --> 00:18:31.954]  I've never bowed.
[00:18:32.854 --> 00:18:36.476]  But at a certain point, you put enough weight on the back of a donkey, its back's going to break.
[00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:41.638]  And so that's where we are.
[00:18:42.558 --> 00:18:47.300]  And there's a lot of stuff behind the scenes, contrary to what you see in the news.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.001]  The bankruptcy of free speech is going well.
[00:18:49.821 --> 00:18:50.842]  Things are coming to a head.
[00:18:51.702 --> 00:18:53.723]  We'll be able to stay on the air indefinitely.
[00:18:54.753 --> 00:19:00.641]  Except that little chink in the armor that the judge said Jones can pay half the legal fees.
[00:19:01.161 --> 00:19:05.867]  Just off of the fact that if I say something that's a lie in bankruptcy court, I go to prison.
[00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:11.034]  But when the other side files stuff saying, you know, he has hundreds of millions of dollars, just made it up.
[00:19:13.431 --> 00:19:16.752]  And it's then believed, well, that's what happens to you.
[00:19:16.832 --> 00:19:17.513]  You see the headlines.
[00:19:17.853 --> 00:19:24.315]  Jones is refusing to pay the billion plus dollars he owes these people in their kangaroo courts, where the judge already found me guilty.
[00:19:24.495 --> 00:19:25.676]  Then the jury decided how much.
[00:19:25.896 --> 00:19:27.977]  And they have experts on to say, he's worth $400 million.
[00:19:28.757 --> 00:19:30.417]  He has $200 million in cash in the bank.
[00:19:30.437 --> 00:19:31.898]  We're like, can we show a bank statement?
[00:19:32.218 --> 00:19:33.098]  I have my bank statements.
[00:19:33.138 --> 00:19:34.839]  I have sworn federal filings and bankruptcy.
[00:19:35.119 --> 00:19:36.799]  The judge in Texas said, you can't show that.
[00:19:37.119 --> 00:19:38.439]  Judge in Connecticut said, you can't show that.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.380]  And if you talk about it, I'm going to put you in jail for six months.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:47.882]  The Connecticut judge said on TV, you say that, you stop our lies, you're going to jail.
[00:19:49.065 --> 00:19:50.847]  So I refused to even testify the second day.
[00:19:51.127 --> 00:19:51.788]  There was no point.
[00:19:52.228 --> 00:19:54.710]  She gave us a list of 20-something things I couldn't say.
[00:19:55.471 --> 00:19:56.412]  Like, I'm innocent.
[00:19:56.732 --> 00:19:58.013]  Actually gave us a printout.
[00:19:58.574 --> 00:19:59.214]  I'm innocent.
[00:19:59.275 --> 00:20:00.656]  You cannot say you're innocent.
[00:20:02.437 --> 00:20:05.240]  Because the jury's not allowed to know you're even allowed to say you're innocent.
[00:20:05.981 --> 00:20:06.641]  In 1984.
[00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:08.883]  The judge says you're guilty.
[00:20:08.903 --> 00:20:10.545]  They're going to put on fake evidence.
[00:20:10.865 --> 00:20:12.226]  And they're doing it to everybody now.
[00:20:12.267 --> 00:20:13.388]  Look at this judge in New York.
[00:20:14.318 --> 00:20:22.945]  He found Trump guilty, now he's having a fake trial where he sits there, totally creepy, and his wife's attacking Trump, and Letitia James is having press conferences.
[00:20:23.845 --> 00:20:29.189]  But Trump had $10 billion at the start of this, now he's down to like a billion bucks.
[00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:31.491]  They're destroying him too.
[00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:38.136]  I had millions, a few million, and I increased it into more, and then I got that donation.
[00:20:39.517 --> 00:20:42.431]   So, That's what this comes down to.
[00:20:42.531 --> 00:20:44.954]  So, I mean, who knows if the link's even up there anymore?
[00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:45.835]  I don't even know anymore.
[00:20:46.816 --> 00:20:48.177]  I guess, can we check online?
[00:20:48.558 --> 00:20:51.882]  People could go, I guess, to infowars.com forward slash crypto.
[00:20:52.523 --> 00:20:53.884]  I think that's the address that I was looking for.
[00:20:53.904 --> 00:20:54.645]  Cryptocurrencies.
[00:20:55.006 --> 00:20:57.008]  If somebody wants to make donations there, that'd be great.
[00:20:58.189 --> 00:20:58.610]  We've done...
[00:20:59.691 --> 00:21:02.074]  This book, that's The Great Awakening.
[00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:03.616]  It's twice as long as the last book.
[00:21:03.656 --> 00:21:04.357]  I'm really proud of it.
[00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:07.040]  It's in the whole New World Order operation, how to stop them.
[00:21:07.481 --> 00:21:13.208]  You can buy these for a hundred bucks on the site signed as a fundraiser to know that you help keep us on air.
[00:21:13.528 --> 00:21:18.935]  And this is the one thing I have a deal on where I get half the money from the book.
[00:21:20.083 --> 00:21:23.405]  But last time we sold 20,000 of the Great Reset.
[00:21:24.046 --> 00:21:25.567]  So we bought 20,000 of these.
[00:21:25.867 --> 00:21:29.910]  We haven't even made the money back for the 20,000 because we've only sold 5,000 on the store.
[00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:30.731]  And I appreciate you.
[00:21:30.951 --> 00:21:31.632]  That's a big number.
[00:21:31.872 --> 00:21:33.993]  But we need to sell all 20,000 of the books.
[00:21:34.654 --> 00:21:40.898]  And if we sold the 20,000 books at $100 a piece, that would get me out of the hole.
[00:21:41.559 --> 00:21:44.661]  And then in a year, I'll probably be back here saying, hey, I got a new book.
[00:21:44.681 --> 00:21:47.043]  Because this is a war up against the new world order.
[00:21:47.063 --> 00:21:48.064]  It's about perseverance.
[00:21:49.226 --> 00:21:58.331]  George Washington lost 90% of the battles he was in because he was outnumbered and outgunned, but he persevered for six years and they started winning in the end and they won.
[00:21:59.371 --> 00:22:03.733]  So if you want to keep me in the fight, have a historic memento, go now.
[00:22:03.853 --> 00:22:04.974]  Don't sit on the fence.
[00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:16.380]  Go to infowarestore.com and get it or get an unsigned copy.
[00:22:17.278 --> 00:22:20.099]  It's a big, thick hardcover, and it's powerful.
[00:22:20.619 --> 00:22:27.102]  Tucker Carlson says Alex Jones is often mocked for his flamboyance, but the truth is he's been a far better guy in reality in recent years.
[00:22:27.182 --> 00:22:30.763]  In other words, a far better journalist, let's say, in BC News.
[00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:31.723]  Bill Maher.
[00:22:31.803 --> 00:22:32.584]  Alex Jones gets to speak.
[00:22:32.604 --> 00:22:33.264]  Everybody gets to speak.
[00:22:33.544 --> 00:22:34.044]  Joe Rogan.
[00:22:34.144 --> 00:22:37.765]  Alex Jones is one of the most misunderstood people in the world, and he's right about a lot of S-H-T.
[00:22:39.585 --> 00:22:41.406]  Stephen K. Bannon, from the foreword of the book.
[00:22:42.066 --> 00:22:47.529]  For more than 20 years, no populist figure has had more of a bayonet in the back of the deep state than Alex Jones.
[00:22:47.989 --> 00:22:51.031]  Mickey Willis, author of Plandemic.
[00:22:51.451 --> 00:22:52.191]  Director of Plandemic.
[00:22:53.032 --> 00:22:56.493]  Mainstream media is wrong the vast majority of the time, yet they are never held accountable.
[00:22:56.533 --> 00:22:59.795]  Alex Jones is right the vast majority of the time, yet he's silenced and persecuted.
[00:23:00.255 --> 00:23:10.928]   The globalist I think this show and myself and our listeners and our focal point with our crew and our guests and our reporters is important, because we are.
[00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:20.295]  We've created the talking points that are true, that are on everybody's lips, and it's now the dominant resistance from Japan to Spain to the United States.
[00:23:20.735 --> 00:23:23.878]  And populist anti-globalists are being elected everywhere.
[00:23:25.245 --> 00:23:34.954]  One of them last night, though, because their party's about to win in Spain, so the socialists that run the country are about to ban the party, got shot in the face.
[00:23:36.435 --> 00:23:49.948]  So, the globalists know we're winning, that's why they're defunding the police and authorizing the murder of police everywhere, to create a breakdown of society, and then they think the public will be too stupid, they won't understand it's the globalists that are actually engineering it.
[00:23:51.095 --> 00:23:59.599]  So, we need to stay on air to expose the next pandemic, to expose the next lockdown, which we just did, and this audience was the detonator that just stopped that.
[00:24:00.299 --> 00:24:02.500]  Think of the millions we've warned not to take the shots.
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.881]  Joe Big's got a big breaking news with him.
[00:24:05.481 --> 00:24:07.442]  Five hours after the show yesterday...
[00:24:09.844 --> 00:24:21.435]  They came to him, treated him nice, apologized to him, stopped torturing him, stopped keeping him in box handcuffs, and took him to Talladega, his final federal facility, and he actually got a meal.
[00:24:22.616 --> 00:24:30.103]  And he actually got clothes, and didn't have to sleep in his underwear after months of being tortured since he was convicted for terrorism, for shaking a fence.
[00:24:31.464 --> 00:24:33.025]  That's the power of this audience.
[00:24:33.746 --> 00:24:34.206]  Congress.
[00:24:35.339 --> 00:25:00.630]   has had hearings on Monday and brought up what's happening to Owen Schroyer and free speech and now this has happened because of you because of this focal point so we can't let them shut this down ladies and gentlemen we've come so far and a couple million dollars sounds like a lot the average person but in a war with the new world order this is truly David versus Goliath and We are going to win this thing.
[00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:02.471]  We give up, it gets ten times worse.
[00:25:02.792 --> 00:25:05.594]  Look how popular anti-New World Order information is.
[00:25:06.014 --> 00:25:06.814]  It's everywhere.
[00:25:07.775 --> 00:25:15.820]  Look at all the most popular people now are saying world government's evil, depopulation's evil, the globalists and world government want to kill you and your family.
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.641]  That's true.
[00:25:16.921 --> 00:25:17.862]  It's horrible to admit.
[00:25:18.202 --> 00:25:19.723]  It's horrible to get your mind around it.
[00:25:21.653 --> 00:25:24.595]  But once you admit the horror, you have a chance to stop it.
[00:25:24.755 --> 00:25:35.023]  They've always had a leg up on us because their agenda is so brazen, so destructive, so evil, so maniacal, so genocidal, so satanic, that people just can't believe what's happening.
[00:25:35.324 --> 00:25:37.626]  Most victims of crime, when it's actually happening, can't believe it.
[00:25:37.866 --> 00:25:39.887]  Even after, if they survive, they can't believe it.
[00:25:40.147 --> 00:25:43.110]  Well, now people finally know we're in a world of shit!
[00:25:44.997 --> 00:25:52.979]  We are overrun, we are under attack, they're coming after everybody, and there's all these fools that work for the system that think they're going to be left alone.
[00:25:53.059 --> 00:25:55.360]  No, they're coming for the whole shooting match.
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:11.144]  So, I am not going to give up, but essentially, in the next month, and I guess we could do fundraisers or whatever, but I mean, we know that less than 1% of people buy stuff or donate, and I don't want to open the phones up a day and have people calling about this.
[00:26:11.164 --> 00:26:11.804]  I want to cover news.
[00:26:14.366 --> 00:26:16.908]  And I know the people that donate and support are great, and I love you.
[00:26:17.128 --> 00:26:18.029]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:26:18.109 --> 00:26:18.749]  I'm not bitching.
[00:26:18.989 --> 00:26:21.891]  But my gosh, we have been so effective.
[00:26:21.931 --> 00:26:22.972]  We've changed the world.
[00:26:23.012 --> 00:26:26.295]  The globalists hate this broadcast as much as they hate Trump.
[00:26:26.535 --> 00:26:29.357]  They hate no one more than Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:26:31.518 --> 00:26:32.619]  Except maybe Julian Assange.
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:34.921]  Because we got their number.
[00:26:36.109 --> 00:26:43.934]  And we're organizing people and they know we've got a spirit of resistance and they think if we can beat Trump and beat Jones, we'll be able to beat anybody.
[00:26:43.974 --> 00:26:45.315]  So I got a target on my back.
[00:26:46.035 --> 00:26:49.878]  And all I need, I mean, I can deal with them trying to put me in jail and set me up or kill me.
[00:26:50.218 --> 00:26:52.479]  If that happens, that's, God wants that to happen.
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.581]  But God is telling you, that's how God works.
[00:26:56.622 --> 00:27:00.985]  If you want to keep this on air, you need to understand, this isn't a game.
[00:27:02.952 --> 00:27:08.318]  I need you to go to MFORWARSTORE.COM and get The Great Awakening, Defeating the Globalist, and Launching the Next Great Renaissance.
[00:27:08.979 --> 00:27:10.721]  I need to sell all of those books.
[00:27:12.943 --> 00:27:18.089]  I need you to go to DEFENDJONES.COM if you want to make a straight up donation.
[00:27:18.129 --> 00:27:21.353]  That goes to me for my bills and my expenses and legal.
[00:27:21.593 --> 00:27:22.494]  DEFENDJONES.COM.
[00:27:23.587 --> 00:27:29.189]  I need you if you want to support Free Speech Systems and keep it on the air because it needs funds as well.
[00:27:29.729 --> 00:27:32.770]  And part of that and the agreement I have will actually go for my expenses.
[00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:38.372]  And that is InfoWars.com forward slash crypto.
[00:27:39.252 --> 00:27:41.412]  InfoWars.com forward slash crypto.
[00:27:41.492 --> 00:27:42.113]  I'm going from memory.
[00:27:42.153 --> 00:27:42.553]  That's right.
[00:27:42.593 --> 00:27:42.973]  Right, guys?
[00:27:44.453 --> 00:27:44.793]  That's right.
[00:27:44.873 --> 00:27:46.874]  InfoWars.com forward slash crypto.
[00:27:48.415 --> 00:27:59.149]   And if one of those people Whether it's a thousand dollars in Bitcoin or a million dollars, none of it's gonna be worth anything soon if this doesn't take place.
[00:28:00.449 --> 00:28:04.331]  And believe me, if you think they're gonna stop with Alex Jones, you got another thing coming.
[00:28:04.351 --> 00:28:10.915]  They're bringing in all this censorship, all their control, and we're seeing the biggest victories in Awakening we've ever seen.
[00:28:10.935 --> 00:28:15.677]  And you know it's just gonna be ten times worse if we don't continue to fight.
[00:28:15.997 --> 00:28:31.931]   Imagine how bad it'd be We'd be in lockdown again if it wasn't for this audience months ago, getting the word out, making it the top story, and then right after I said they were going to try to bring it out, within days they tried to relaunch and it exploded even bigger, and they had congressional hearings, and now all over the world it failed!
[00:28:32.451 --> 00:28:37.073]  And yet you, that's this show, all of us, you did that!
[00:28:38.394 --> 00:28:40.816]  Joe Biden's a pedophile and raised gas prices, he did that!
[00:28:41.116 --> 00:28:42.136]  You did the good stuff!
[00:28:42.897 --> 00:28:46.299]  This is the number to bet on, folks, on roulette wheel, you win every time!
[00:28:47.219 --> 00:28:51.940]  You cannot invest in a better place in the fight with your word of mouth, your prayer, spreading the word, putting the clips up.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.941]  But, I'm telling you, I need your support.
[00:28:56.141 --> 00:28:57.522]  Well, we live to see it.
[00:28:58.402 --> 00:29:14.386]  I remember my dad's dad, and my mother's dad, when I was knee-high to a grasshopper sitting at their kitchen tables, their breakfast tables, and them, separately, they were friends, lived in different parts of Texas, but they visited a few times a year.
[00:29:15.543 --> 00:29:29.435]  And they had Cleon Skousen's books on their kitchen tables about the Naked Communists and the Naked Capitalists and they knew all about the New World Order when I was five, six, seven years old.
[00:29:31.138 --> 00:29:37.703]  And it's all they talked about, what the globalists were going to do to America, what the international communists were going to do.
[00:29:37.784 --> 00:29:41.647]  And they were so sad to see the country slipping and becoming decadent.
[00:29:41.967 --> 00:29:43.508]  Boy, were they ahead of their time.
[00:29:43.528 --> 00:29:47.912]  Imagine what they'd think today if they were here on the planet watching all this.
[00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:49.793]  We know, we know they're still there.
[00:29:49.833 --> 00:29:53.356]  Their spirits are eternal, but I'd imagine they got other things to do now.
[00:29:55.598 --> 00:29:59.101]  Bigger fish to fry, but we're here.
[00:30:01.641 --> 00:30:03.002]  I was on the air with Steve Bannon today.
[00:30:03.062 --> 00:30:04.282]  In fact, I meant to tell the crew this.
[00:30:05.403 --> 00:30:07.224]  Steve thought it was the best appearance I ever did with him.
[00:30:07.284 --> 00:30:10.305]  I don't know if that's the case, but I thought we'd air some of that today.
[00:30:10.325 --> 00:30:15.067]  If you go to his Rumble account, he does like five shows a day, one hour shows.
[00:30:15.788 --> 00:30:18.509]  Get the 10 a.m., 11 a.m.
[00:30:18.569 --> 00:30:21.590]  Eastern show, and I'm on the first 30 minutes.
[00:30:22.791 --> 00:30:24.292]  And I kind of laid out what was going down.
[00:30:24.332 --> 00:30:26.913]  And on air and during the breaks, he told me, he said, no, you're right.
[00:30:28.206 --> 00:30:29.606]  We tried to avert all of this.
[00:30:29.646 --> 00:30:30.547]  We tried to stop it.
[00:30:30.627 --> 00:30:33.488]  But now it's going to get really, really bad.
[00:30:34.848 --> 00:30:37.909]  And again, I don't tell you that to try to scare you.
[00:30:37.949 --> 00:30:39.029]  I tell you so you can get ready.
[00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:48.532]  And the best analogy that I've got is one time I was driving back from Fredericksburg visiting family with my dad.
[00:30:50.193 --> 00:30:53.614]  And there were a bunch of thunderstorms and we didn't know tornadoes.
[00:30:55.154 --> 00:30:57.095]  And we got picked up by a tornado.
[00:30:58.211 --> 00:31:02.137]  And thrown off the road with like a 50 foot embankment that went down into oak trees.
[00:31:03.379 --> 00:31:11.191]  But that... Seemed like an hour, but that 5, 6, 7 seconds when the Tahoe was spinning...
[00:31:12.082 --> 00:31:13.423]  I'm only driving like 50 in the rain.
[00:31:13.743 --> 00:31:17.105]  The car spins like five, six times off the ground.
[00:31:17.845 --> 00:31:21.827]  And the tornado threw us down and it didn't, we didn't go upside down.
[00:31:21.867 --> 00:31:30.611]  We went on our wheels down, shooting down the gully like a shotgun shell or a bowling ball and then slammed into three oak trees.
[00:31:31.892 --> 00:31:37.655]  Three oak trees coming out, medium sized oak trees, you know, foot or so around, foot and a half around, about that big each.
[00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.932]  Probably the same tree, you know, big, big knot of trees.
[00:31:41.692 --> 00:31:52.259]  And it smashed the Tahoe all the way up with the two back seat rows and crushed the middle seat rows up against his, broke my dad's chair.
[00:31:53.159 --> 00:31:54.800]  His, his, his, his seat broke.
[00:31:55.221 --> 00:31:56.061]  He got a concussion.
[00:31:56.802 --> 00:31:58.263]  And it was in the summer, so he got out.
[00:31:58.303 --> 00:32:01.943]   there were fire ants, because when it floods, fire ants come up the tops of the...
[00:32:01.943 --> 00:32:07.222]   They're from Brazil, they're a water ant. They live around rivers. They come up knots on the
[00:32:07.222 --> 00:32:11.083]   tops of the bushes and the plants. We had just fire ants all over us. And the state
[00:32:11.083 --> 00:32:14.103]   police pull up and they said, "Yeah, we were parked over there. You see that barn? It just
[00:32:14.103 --> 00:32:19.142]   got destroyed by tornado. We watched you." By the luck of God, there's not a lot of
[00:32:19.142 --> 00:32:24.502]   state police out there. State police were pulled up some road and one of them was,
[00:32:24.502 --> 00:32:28.423]  another one came and they said you're lucky to be alive.
[00:32:26.623 --> 00:32:32.087]  And he said, I've never seen a, actually seen, you've seen it on TV, a car picked up by a tornado.
[00:32:32.788 --> 00:32:43.696]  And I remember, it was just, we're driving along, it's windy, it's green light, it's like seven o'clock at night, but it's not even nighttime yet, but it looks dark.
[00:32:44.437 --> 00:32:56.432]   And all of a sudden, and the car, and I remember with centripetal force looking over at my dad and bracing the steering wheel and saying, brace for impact.
[00:32:56.993 --> 00:32:58.753]  And I was thinking, man, I hope my dad doesn't die.
[00:32:59.293 --> 00:33:04.154]  And I pushed back in the seat and then we shot down that embankment like a bullet.
[00:33:05.114 --> 00:33:07.475]  And if it had hit on the side of the front, we'd have been dead.
[00:33:07.675 --> 00:33:09.115]  But by the grace of God, it hit the back.
[00:33:09.135 --> 00:33:14.236]  I remember my grandmother was there about three hours before.
[00:33:16.028 --> 00:33:20.811]  We're visiting her son, my uncle, and my ex-wife, and little kids were there.
[00:33:22.171 --> 00:33:23.352]  My middle daughter wasn't even born yet.
[00:33:24.433 --> 00:33:27.975]  And I'm a first to rest in Charlotte.
[00:33:28.275 --> 00:33:32.337]  And my grandmother always was right.
[00:33:32.377 --> 00:33:33.718]  She said, we're leaving.
[00:33:35.178 --> 00:33:35.979]  There's storms.
[00:33:36.059 --> 00:33:37.640]  And we didn't even have phones out back then.
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:38.500]  There weren't iPhones.
[00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:40.680]  This is like 15 years ago.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:45.299]   But she could see off the hill they lived in outside of Fredericksburg,
[00:33:45.299 --> 00:33:47.480]  the thunderstorms in the distance.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:52.420]   I mean, we're talking 50 miles away off that hilltop or mountaintop they lived on.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.400]  It was basically a mountain.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.199]  Incredible vistas.
[00:33:56.199 --> 00:33:59.038]  And I said, "Oh, it's all right."
[00:33:59.229 --> 00:34:00.069]  She goes, well, we're leaving.
[00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:02.330]  And my ex-wife goes, yeah, yeah, we're leaving.
[00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:03.630]  So they get in her car and leave.
[00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.051]  We'd driven in two cars.
[00:34:05.271 --> 00:34:07.211]  My Tahoe had a bunch of guns in the back.
[00:34:07.251 --> 00:34:07.791]  We were shooting.
[00:34:08.571 --> 00:34:11.092]  And I stayed, shot some more, drank some coffee for a couple hours.
[00:34:11.692 --> 00:34:12.432]  Should have listened to her.
[00:34:12.472 --> 00:34:13.172]  Should have gone home.
[00:34:13.192 --> 00:34:14.833]  Because by then, it was tornadoes.
[00:34:15.633 --> 00:34:25.475]  But the point is, is that when I looked over at my dad and pushed that steering wheel in and braced my arms and said, brace for impact, it wasn't fear-mongering.
[00:34:26.328 --> 00:34:32.169]  And let me tell you, we are in that Tahoe, in the tornado, like Dorothy's House in Wizard of Oz, folks.
[00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:34.670]  And you better make the most of it.
[00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:37.031]  Let me tell you something.
[00:34:37.051 --> 00:34:38.951]  I'm a guy that's known this is coming for a long time.
[00:34:38.991 --> 00:34:39.751]  I try to stop it.
[00:34:40.731 --> 00:34:42.072]  And I'm not a fearful person.
[00:34:42.512 --> 00:34:43.372]  It's the opposite of fear.
[00:34:43.472 --> 00:34:46.613]  It's disgust, it's sadness, it's revulsion of the globalists.
[00:34:47.073 --> 00:34:51.014]  But more importantly, it's love for my family and love for you and this world we live in together.
[00:34:51.906 --> 00:34:54.087]  And I got to tell you, it's only going to get worse.
[00:34:55.127 --> 00:34:59.489]  And you're going to look back on now as the good old times, just like I told you three years ago.
[00:35:01.069 --> 00:35:05.951]  It's going to get worse and worse and worse, and they're going to have political assassinations everywhere.
[00:35:06.411 --> 00:35:12.714]  They're shooting and stabbing and poisoning people from Australia to Spain, from Sweden to Germany to England.
[00:35:12.954 --> 00:35:17.876]  They're shooting leading populist leaders that are winning in the polls in the face.
[00:35:18.276 --> 00:35:20.517]  They're injecting them with poison on TV.
[00:35:21.957 --> 00:35:23.438]  None of the leftists are getting charged.
[00:35:24.158 --> 00:35:25.859]  They have a green light to murder us.
[00:35:26.599 --> 00:35:28.059]  They're attacking railways.
[00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:29.740]  They're attacking food production plants.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.181]  They're attacking oil drilling rigs.
[00:35:31.461 --> 00:35:33.121]  They're attacking 18-wheeler drivers.
[00:35:33.542 --> 00:35:39.124]  They are just running around, burning things down and blowing things up and running police over.
[00:35:39.504 --> 00:35:40.604]  And this is just the start.
[00:35:40.644 --> 00:35:41.905]  This is the French Revolution.
[00:35:42.685 --> 00:35:42.985]  Times 10.
[00:35:43.606 --> 00:35:45.927]  This is the French Revolution to the 10th power.
[00:35:46.207 --> 00:35:47.768]  This is Satanism.
[00:35:47.788 --> 00:35:49.108]  This is New World Order.
[00:35:49.389 --> 00:35:50.769]  This is Katy Bar the Door.
[00:35:50.989 --> 00:35:53.491]  This is open devil worship, open pedophilia.
[00:35:54.892 --> 00:36:05.194]  This is going to be plunging currencies, exploding massive inflation, massive wars, probably nuclear.
[00:36:05.274 --> 00:36:14.296]  I mean, it's just going to be... All these evil people that think they can be evil and do all this, think they're destabilizing the world to bring in their control, are bringing in something that's going to destroy them.
[00:36:16.236 --> 00:36:23.258]  The FBI thinks they can manage all the crime and the terror they've released, and the open borders, and the Justice Department, and their counterparts in Europe.
[00:36:24.645 --> 00:36:29.889]  All these soft, stupid people think they can unleash hell on us and it's not going to blow back on them.
[00:36:30.169 --> 00:36:33.051]  And I'm telling you, they can't put it back in the closet.
[00:36:33.511 --> 00:36:35.533]  They can't put it back in the gate, back in the box.
[00:36:35.793 --> 00:36:37.334]  Pandora's box is open.
[00:36:41.997 --> 00:36:43.718]  Pandora's box is open.
[00:36:44.579 --> 00:36:47.621]  Now, we can mitigate it and make the crash landing a lot better.
[00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:56.311]  But I am not gonna lie to you and I'm not gonna sugarcoat this and I'm not gonna water this down, okay?
[00:36:59.372 --> 00:37:01.553]  There are a lot of good people trying to stop what's going on.
[00:37:01.913 --> 00:37:05.274]  That's why you see so many prominent people coming out against it and seeing it for what it is.
[00:37:05.714 --> 00:37:06.474]  Yes, it's horrible.
[00:37:06.794 --> 00:37:07.714]  Yes, it's hard to admit.
[00:37:08.074 --> 00:37:15.074]  Yes, it's out of control.
[00:37:15.074 --> 00:37:20.074]  But, this is why we were put on this planet for this test.
[00:37:20.396 --> 00:37:23.540]  And that's the bottom line.
[00:37:25.222 --> 00:37:30.329]  So, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:37:33.313 --> 00:37:38.059]  And the corporate media is literally weaponized against us.
[00:37:39.974 --> 00:37:41.554]  And they're even phasing out the reporters now.
[00:37:41.594 --> 00:37:50.737]  It's all going AI, where they just write one simple story that the CIA wants, and then all these fake reporter bot names just go out and populate their lies.
[00:37:51.917 --> 00:37:57.739]  And they've recruited cowards and scum for decades into the intelligence services.
[00:37:58.639 --> 00:38:01.200]  A lot of them are devil worshippers, pedophiles, you name it.
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:08.722]  Most of these big top judges are super compromised bad news, and they have completed their corruption.
[00:38:10.014 --> 00:38:10.855]  They have completed it.
[00:38:11.815 --> 00:38:17.879]  Not 100%, but they've got, in the high positions, they've got about 70% pure evil right now.
[00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:19.800]  The mid-level positions is about half.
[00:38:22.302 --> 00:38:30.367]  And they are indicting all the populist frontrunners from Argentina to the United States.
[00:38:33.008 --> 00:38:35.450]  They're debanking all the leaders of the resistance.
[00:38:36.638 --> 00:38:40.081]  And they're two inches away from having their cashless society control grid in.
[00:38:40.881 --> 00:38:43.804]  And when those central bank digital currencies go in, they're already in China.
[00:38:44.384 --> 00:38:45.265]  Italy's putting them in.
[00:38:45.445 --> 00:38:48.548]  It's going EU-wide next year.
[00:38:49.188 --> 00:38:50.089]  I've got clips of that.
[00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.492]  Hell is going to follow this.
[00:38:55.313 --> 00:38:58.736]  This is global post-industrial depopulation.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.004]  And people that lie and go along with this think, oh, it's incremental, they get ahead by serving the evil.
[00:39:05.344 --> 00:39:11.368]  But if you look at the trajectory, and what it's already done to the minions that served this, it's destroying them as well.
[00:39:11.668 --> 00:39:23.137]  But they're so cowardly, and they have subconscious Stockholm Syndrome, that they can't admit they're faced by this horror.
[00:39:24.113 --> 00:39:36.403]  So they decide to project all their fear about the minions, the unconscious ones, onto people trying to stop it, and say, look how... It's like when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who's not perfect by any stretch, was on C-SPAN a month ago.
[00:39:36.443 --> 00:39:38.205]  I played the clip, and the caller calls in.
[00:39:38.225 --> 00:39:42.428]  The lady goes, you lie and say the shots hurt us.
[00:39:42.488 --> 00:39:44.330]  You lie and say Atrazine hurts us.
[00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:46.732]  You lie and say 5G hurts us.
[00:39:46.792 --> 00:39:47.712]  Why do you lie?
[00:39:47.752 --> 00:39:49.214]  You're causing fear.
[00:39:49.954 --> 00:39:51.636]  And he went, lady, this is all on record.
[00:39:52.514 --> 00:39:59.393]   I'm not the one doing it to you, but see, they see it as us saying open borders is
[00:39:59.393 --> 00:40:00.914]  deadly, fentanyl is deadly.
[00:40:00.914 --> 00:40:06.273]   And when their kid dies from fentanyl laced in marijuana, they don't blame Joe
[00:40:06.273 --> 00:40:12.032]   Biden and Xi Jinping and their reverse opium war they're running on us.
[00:40:12.032 --> 00:40:18.114]  They blame you.
[00:40:18.114 --> 00:40:19.114]  Thank you.
[00:40:19.531 --> 00:40:20.172]  They blame me.
[00:40:21.837 --> 00:40:24.059]  They blame police officers working their asses off.
[00:40:24.379 --> 00:40:25.400]  Say what you want about cops.
[00:40:26.661 --> 00:40:29.243]  On average, they're some of the most upstanding, hard-working, good people we've got.
[00:40:29.483 --> 00:40:30.824]  There's some jerks in there like anywhere.
[00:40:31.384 --> 00:40:32.746]  But they got a rough job, folks.
[00:40:33.926 --> 00:40:35.788]  Paramedics have an even probably rougher job.
[00:40:35.828 --> 00:40:36.969]  Firefighters have a really hard job.
[00:40:37.409 --> 00:40:38.990]  You see horrible stuff all day long.
[00:40:39.351 --> 00:40:39.731]  It's rough.
[00:40:40.211 --> 00:40:40.772]  Takes it out of you.
[00:40:42.093 --> 00:40:44.994]  People look at how old I look and they say, what's this guy pitching supplements for?
[00:40:45.374 --> 00:40:47.054]  He looks like he's 55, 6 years old.
[00:40:47.354 --> 00:40:48.615]  Man, I've been living hard.
[00:40:49.515 --> 00:40:50.095]  On purpose.
[00:40:50.835 --> 00:40:53.096]  I'm not trying to live till I'm 90 years old.
[00:40:53.216 --> 00:40:53.816]  I really care.
[00:40:53.856 --> 00:40:55.417]  I've taken the weight of the world on me.
[00:40:55.437 --> 00:40:59.178]  It's like when somebody becomes president, they instantly age 10 years in one year.
[00:40:59.658 --> 00:41:00.798]  This is like being the president.
[00:41:01.893 --> 00:41:08.777]  I read the reports and what the globalists are doing and the intel information and talk to whistleblowers and work until midnight almost every night.
[00:41:09.117 --> 00:41:15.320]  And it's a worthy cause to literally bust my ass and break my bones to get this done.
[00:41:17.121 --> 00:41:41.139]   Because we had ancestors that fought and did incredible things and worked their butts off to get us to this point and now we've flushed it all down the toilet because the CIA funded the whole leftist modern culture And now they put the leftist in charge and notice you're not getting freedom and free love, you're getting tyranny and death and a lowering standard of living and an imploding life expectancy.
[00:41:41.419 --> 00:41:43.120]  We're being murdered!
[00:41:43.561 --> 00:41:47.083]  The sperm counts down by 90% in every western country.
[00:41:47.403 --> 00:41:48.584]  We're being poisoned!
[00:41:49.525 --> 00:41:55.309]  Neurological disorders, cancer, birth defects, all off the chart!
[00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:57.349]  We're being killed!
[00:41:57.349 --> 00:42:07.349]  And then cops get called to a disturbance at a house.
[00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:17.349]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:42:10.791 --> 00:42:17.101]  And because they're white, they get run over by a car and one of the cops gets his legs chopped off.
[00:42:18.712 --> 00:42:33.778]  And then if you go to the leftist websites or WorldStarHipHop or whatever, they're celebrating it as if cutting a cop's legs off who somebody called to help him is going to get people ahead.
[00:42:34.038 --> 00:42:42.421]   And then the crazed brainwashed zombie man that gets out, the black man, is literally going, Like a zombie.
[00:42:42.621 --> 00:42:44.602]  And I could show you countless videos.
[00:42:44.642 --> 00:42:45.982]  I sent it to you like Tuesday.
[00:42:46.422 --> 00:42:48.803]  It's a white woman getting in the face of black people.
[00:42:49.583 --> 00:42:50.323]  Everybody's doing this.
[00:42:51.003 --> 00:42:59.365]  At a grocery store, she's going... I've gone to the pro-abortion rallies and there'll be thousands of women literally going, I love Satan!
[00:42:59.605 --> 00:43:00.825]  And it's not an act, folks.
[00:43:03.006 --> 00:43:03.826]  It's the demonic...
[00:43:04.929 --> 00:43:06.949]  Breakdown of society.
[00:43:06.989 --> 00:43:07.350]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:08.590]  Show this lady first.
[00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:11.691]  I said there's hundreds of these videos.
[00:43:11.771 --> 00:43:12.551]  Show this lady first.
[00:43:12.451 --> 00:43:14.451]  Turn the audio up.
[00:43:14.451 --> 00:43:16.451]  [Screaming]
[00:43:16.451 --> 00:43:18.451]  [Heavy Breathing]
[00:43:18.451 --> 00:43:20.451]  [Screaming]
[00:43:20.451 --> 00:43:22.451]  [Heavy Breathing]
[00:43:22.451 --> 00:43:24.451]  [Screaming]
[00:43:24.451 --> 00:43:26.451]  [Screaming]
[00:43:26.451 --> 00:43:28.451]  [Screaming]
[00:43:28.451 --> 00:43:30.451]  She's on SSRIs.
[00:43:30.451 --> 00:43:32.451]  She watches TV all day. She's been hypnotized.
[00:43:32.451 --> 00:43:34.451]  And that is her subconscious and unconscious.
[00:43:35.352 --> 00:43:36.172]  That's who she is.
[00:43:37.573 --> 00:43:38.974]  The lower brain is activated.
[00:43:42.295 --> 00:43:43.256]  And she's having a breakdown.
[00:43:44.296 --> 00:43:56.703]  And then the media tells you we have a breakdown, go get an AR-15, that's the gun they tell you to get, so everybody goes, I must go kill, I must get AR-15, I must go kill children, I must go to black church, I must go to black grocery store and kill black people.
[00:43:57.276 --> 00:43:59.137]  And then other people, I must go kill white children.
[00:43:59.458 --> 00:44:02.020]  I must go kill, I must go kill white cops.
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:05.022]  And then that's the thing you do when you decide to break down.
[00:44:05.282 --> 00:44:09.225]  You just go shoot whatever group you don't like, or you go run over them with a car.
[00:44:11.026 --> 00:44:24.657]  Meanwhile, the socialists and globalists and communists are stabbing and poisoning and shooting people every day and indicting people every day from local to national governments that are patriots and pro-human and know what's going on.
[00:44:26.451 --> 00:44:32.213]  Roll it with audio of the police officers in this ambush.
[00:44:32.133 --> 00:44:41.693]   here it is (sounds of a plane taking off)
[00:44:41.693 --> 00:44:43.693]  (sound of a plane taking off)
[00:44:43.693 --> 00:44:45.693]  (sound of a plane taking off)
[00:44:45.693 --> 00:44:47.693]  (sound of a plane taking off)
[00:44:47.693 --> 00:44:49.692]  (sound of a plane taking off)
[00:44:49.692 --> 00:44:51.692]  (sound of a plane taking off)
[00:44:51.692 --> 00:44:53.692]  (sound of a plane taking off)
[00:44:53.692 --> 00:44:55.692]  (sound of a plane taking off)
[00:44:55.692 --> 00:44:57.693]  (sound of a plane taking off)
[00:44:57.693 --> 00:44:59.693]  (sound of a plane taking off)
[00:44:59.693 --> 00:45:01.693]  (sound of a plane taking off)
[00:45:01.693 --> 00:45:03.693]  (sound of a plane taking off)
[00:45:03.693 --> 00:45:06.693]  And more angles of it.
[00:45:07.361 --> 00:45:10.822]  And then from the police officer's body cam.
[00:45:14.463 --> 00:45:15.263]  This is what's going on.
[00:45:16.623 --> 00:45:17.163]  Imagine that.
[00:45:17.183 --> 00:45:21.525]  Get out of the vehicle right now!
[00:45:21.365 --> 00:45:31.365]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:45:31.365 --> 00:45:37.445]  And the police are so conditioned.
[00:45:37.458 --> 00:45:41.779]  Because police shoot white people 5 to 1.
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.201]  White cops, black cops, doesn't matter, Hispanic cops.
[00:45:45.621 --> 00:45:47.521]  Because they know they, you know, they need to.
[00:45:47.561 --> 00:45:50.202]  This person's, you know, just killed people, just attacked people.
[00:45:50.663 --> 00:45:53.604]  Gets out, walking towards you, making demon noises.
[00:45:54.444 --> 00:45:55.384]  Baring their teeth at you.
[00:45:55.724 --> 00:45:58.926]  And then you, you, one guy's just been run over.
[00:45:59.126 --> 00:46:02.467]  He doesn't even dare fire his gun at the God.
[00:46:03.407 --> 00:46:04.768]  Because he'll go to prison.
[00:46:06.718 --> 00:46:08.459]  But meanwhile, they're aborting most of the black babies.
[00:46:08.479 --> 00:46:10.000]  They're targeting one of the shots.
[00:46:10.561 --> 00:46:16.545]  But the face of the New Order is, oh, all the corporate sponsors, all the corporate pitch people, all of them are now black.
[00:46:17.748 --> 00:46:19.850]  And I see the black talk shows going, we're taking over.
[00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:20.810]  We run everything now.
[00:46:21.151 --> 00:46:24.313]  We're all the corporate spokespersons because you're the face of this.
[00:46:24.653 --> 00:46:29.497]  The New World Order just put your mask on like Jason puts his mask on before he goes and kills people.
[00:46:29.817 --> 00:46:34.881]  They just put a black face on this and there's going to be black people that then think, well, this is part of my mission.
[00:46:35.742 --> 00:46:37.963]  I'm going to go out and I'm going to kill cops by any means necessary.
[00:46:38.364 --> 00:46:39.845]  Maybe Kamala Harris will bail him out.
[00:46:42.483 --> 00:46:43.404]  Good thing I'm not a cop.
[00:46:43.424 --> 00:46:50.749]  If I just watch that guy purposely turn out of his way to run over police, and he gets out and starts walking towards me, you're not getting shot with a taser.
[00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:52.630]  And I'll let the jury decide.
[00:46:53.571 --> 00:46:54.632]  You're gonna get hit with hot lead.
[00:46:54.652 --> 00:46:55.672]  I don't care if you're white or black.
[00:46:55.973 --> 00:47:00.616]  I see something lunatic, like a zombie coming at me, you're dead!
[00:47:02.355 --> 00:47:07.157]  And thank God for the Second Amendment, because it's stopping and impeding the majority of these now.
[00:47:07.777 --> 00:47:12.179]  The mass shootings are getting shut off, they're getting nipped in the bud, and the globalists are so pissed.
[00:47:12.579 --> 00:47:21.062]  That's why in the cities they control, where they tell the citizens don't have guns, the citizens follow the law, and they get murdered at record rates.
[00:47:21.403 --> 00:47:33.769]   Like this new vigilante sees, you know, armed robbery going on, decides he's not going to be part of it, shoots the person, And boy, they're going to throw his ass under the jail.
[00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:41.032]  Police aren't going to protect you either, because they're cucked, too.
[00:47:41.052 --> 00:47:41.732]  You see the police?
[00:47:42.072 --> 00:47:43.493]  They know not to defend themselves, too.
[00:47:45.454 --> 00:47:46.494]  We're all cucked.
[00:47:46.534 --> 00:47:48.495]  We all know not to protect ourselves.
[00:47:49.195 --> 00:47:54.137]  But the George Soros DA will put your ass under the jail.
[00:47:57.366 --> 00:48:07.356]  And if you're a conservative and rattle a fence, though, you're going to get 20-something years in prison and solitary confinement and get fed every two days and have box handcuffs on you until your hands fall off.
[00:48:08.477 --> 00:48:19.307]  Because weirdo judges, weirdo freakazoids that couldn't find their ass with both hands have got their degrees and they're in charge.
[00:48:19.708 --> 00:48:29.110]   And they're the lawyers that want to mitigate Danger and get rid of swimming pools and slides because they might hurt somebody.
[00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:35.473]  But then meanwhile, they start war with the people and open the borders and defund the police and start World War 3.
[00:48:36.173 --> 00:48:39.173]  Oh, but they're the lawyers mitigating risk.
[00:48:39.173 --> 00:48:46.574]  Reportedly, one of the cops had his legs cut off.
[00:48:47.077 --> 00:48:56.677]  You can see it in the video.
[00:48:56.677 --> 00:49:01.478]   And you know what the backlash will be after this reign of terror, after the French Revolution 2.0.
[00:49:01.677 --> 00:49:15.929]  They'll give us a Napoleon Bonaparte after a decade of hell, then we'll all have national IDs, we'll all be face-scanning our houses, and the police with drones will be authorized to kill you if you have a crooked toenail or a mustard stain on your shirt.
[00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:20.873]  So don't think this is some worship-the-police exercise.
[00:49:21.413 --> 00:49:23.315]  This is Hegelian dialectic.
[00:49:24.923 --> 00:49:32.048]  This is the takeover of some, that's why movies like Joker, how cool it is to kill cops, how cool it is to burn down civilization.
[00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:37.352]  Go out, it was all, came out a year before Black Lives Matter and the Summer of Rage in 2020.
[00:49:37.512 --> 00:49:44.938]  And it's all part of their destabilization plan.
[00:49:45.958 --> 00:49:52.223]  I'm going to go to break, I'm going to come back with the European leaders, raise alarm over digital ID, central medical currencies now being rolled out.
[00:49:55.862 --> 00:49:56.883]  We've got videos of it.
[00:49:57.643 --> 00:50:00.405]  It ties into what Tony Blair is pushing as well.
[00:50:02.146 --> 00:50:02.506]  It's here.
[00:50:02.546 --> 00:50:03.146]  It's not coming.
[00:50:04.507 --> 00:50:06.408]  Also, Europe announcing plans to ban cars.
[00:50:06.448 --> 00:50:07.449]  California as well.
[00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:09.390]  It's all happening.
[00:50:11.391 --> 00:50:12.852]  Big developments in the war with Russia.
[00:50:12.872 --> 00:50:15.914]  The globalists now know they've lost.
[00:50:17.695 --> 00:50:18.655]  And so what's going to come next?
[00:50:18.675 --> 00:50:18.916]  More wars.
[00:50:22.099 --> 00:50:27.463]  It's all coming up, and I will also open the phones up after I've gotten to all this news.
[00:50:27.583 --> 00:50:29.924]  But if you're a new listener and just tuned in, nice to have you here.
[00:50:29.945 --> 00:50:39.511]  If you wonder why there's such a hubbub and such attacks on the broadcast, it's because we explain the wide spectrum of what's going on and explain there's a way out of this.
[00:50:40.472 --> 00:50:45.355]  That's why I ask listeners again to understand that we've been in one hell of a fight against the globalists.
[00:50:45.375 --> 00:50:47.076]  Everybody else, they get off air quicker than this.
[00:50:48.097 --> 00:50:48.978]  I've been fighting these people.
[00:50:48.998 --> 00:50:50.379]  They've been trying to get me off the air for decades.
[00:50:51.405 --> 00:50:59.071]  And they want this infrastructure shut down, and they want this show shut down, and I think it's absolutely imperative that not happen.
[00:50:59.111 --> 00:51:08.159]  But I've explained, when you go to InfoWareStore.com and get things like Ultra 12, the best B12 out there, take it out of the tongue, 40% off right now, that keeps free speech on the air.
[00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:16.808]  But the courts ruled that free speech systems can pay me a million and a half dollars a year and I'm supposed to pay five million dollars a year in legal bills.
[00:51:17.608 --> 00:51:21.950]  And of course it's done to make it look like I wasn't taken off air and they just think I'll quit.
[00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:22.590]  I won't.
[00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:26.651]  But I'll just have to probably go stay at my parents' house.
[00:51:27.331 --> 00:51:36.554]  But see, the reason they'll be able to shut it down is then they'll shut free speech down because free speech won't be able to pay its legal bills because the court ruled that I have to pay them.
[00:51:37.915 --> 00:51:38.635]  See how that works?
[00:51:39.574 --> 00:51:42.636]  Which is cutesy and fun and nice.
[00:51:43.297 --> 00:51:44.818]  So I don't care about not having money.
[00:51:44.918 --> 00:51:47.920]  I care about the fact that I don't have money and they're going to shut this operation down.
[00:51:48.941 --> 00:51:50.002]  And that's what they want to do.
[00:51:50.342 --> 00:51:51.843]  But you can stop them right now.
[00:51:51.903 --> 00:52:02.150]  You can decide to take action and get the fundraiser signed copy of The Great Awakening, Defeating the Globalist and Launching the Next Great Renaissance with Alex Jones, Kinect and Lively and forward by Steve Bannon.
[00:52:02.651 --> 00:52:04.092]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:52:04.552 --> 00:52:06.353]  Get the unsigned or the signed book.
[00:52:06.674 --> 00:52:07.154]  The signed is $100.
[00:52:09.016 --> 00:52:09.556]  Unsigned is like $30.
[00:52:10.217 --> 00:52:12.739]  It's a big thick hardcover.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:18.162]  And if you want to support me as well, go to DefendJones.com.
[00:52:19.203 --> 00:52:20.264]  Make a straight donation there.
[00:52:20.284 --> 00:52:23.366]  That way I get like 95% of it after the credit card fees it gives him go.
[00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:32.933]  Or if you want to make a donation in crypto, Bitcoin, you name it, go to InfoWars.com forward slash crypto and free speech gets part of it and I get part of it as well.
[00:52:33.153 --> 00:52:34.934]  But there's not really been any donations there in a while.
[00:52:35.455 --> 00:52:44.328]   And so I'm having to work this out in my mind, and I'm having to figure out what I do.
[00:52:45.969 --> 00:52:49.471]  Because essentially, this is the worst position InfoWars has ever been in.
[00:52:49.791 --> 00:52:53.013]  You look at the climate, of course they don't want us on the air during the election.
[00:52:54.105 --> 00:52:58.610]  And because all of us together headed off the new lockdowns, you know, all of it.
[00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:59.431]  I mean, they don't want us here.
[00:53:00.212 --> 00:53:03.295]  So I think it's imperative to keep us on air, but I need you to take action now.
[00:53:03.715 --> 00:53:07.940]  I need you to go to InfoWarshaw.com and get The Great Awakening and get Ultra 12 right now.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.920]  Please keep us on air.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:23.920]  [intro]
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:27.920]   Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:53:28.728 --> 00:53:31.910]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:36.771]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:53:37.391 --> 00:53:39.532]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:53:39.832 --> 00:53:47.815]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[00:53:48.435 --> 00:53:49.756]  This is the Great Awakening.
[00:53:50.276 --> 00:53:54.177]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:53:54.657 --> 00:53:58.178]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[00:53:58.438 --> 00:54:00.959]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[00:54:01.319 --> 00:54:05.740]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.521]  Either signed as a fundraiser, and I thank you for the support, or unsigned.
[00:54:09.721 --> 00:54:11.823]  But whatever you do, take action now.
[00:54:12.183 --> 00:54:15.326]  We're fighting for you, but we can't keep on if you don't support us.
[00:54:15.606 --> 00:54:17.768]  So please, get the historic book now.
[00:54:18.149 --> 00:54:21.692]  Go now to InfoWarsTore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[00:54:21.731 --> 00:54:35.971]  The Great Awakening at MFOR Store.
[00:54:35.987 --> 00:54:37.748]  We can easily stop it if we rally against it.
[00:54:37.768 --> 00:54:40.929]  We actually have massive opposition taking place.
[00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:44.090]  And we're going to hit it all coming up.
[00:54:45.871 --> 00:54:47.212]  So please stay with us for that.
[00:54:47.372 --> 00:54:50.693]  Huge war news on the Russia front.
[00:54:52.073 --> 00:54:54.014]  And massive domestic news.
[00:54:54.074 --> 00:54:55.455]  Big article on InfoWars that's key.
[00:54:55.495 --> 00:54:57.215]  We have to admit this if we're going to reverse it.
[00:54:57.235 --> 00:54:58.876]  The U.S.
[00:54:58.916 --> 00:55:01.437]  has lost its first world status.
[00:55:03.271 --> 00:55:06.312]  And we have to admit the bad things that are happening if we're going to reverse them.
[00:55:06.332 --> 00:55:14.074]  It's like if you're 100 pounds overweight, I'm only like 30, 40, 50 pounds overweight, you got to admit, hey, I'm going to have a heart attack or, you know, get diabetes if I keep this going.
[00:55:14.614 --> 00:55:15.334]  It's the same thing.
[00:55:15.534 --> 00:55:16.594]  And we just have to do this.
[00:55:17.715 --> 00:55:18.675]  And I can keep my chin up.
[00:55:18.895 --> 00:55:21.176]  And I'm actually very satisfied.
[00:55:21.216 --> 00:55:22.096]  I'm not a prideful person.
[00:55:22.116 --> 00:55:24.176]  I'm satisfied in the job we've done.
[00:55:24.196 --> 00:55:25.297]  And quite frankly, I'm amazed.
[00:55:25.777 --> 00:55:27.457]  And I've seen how far we've come together.
[00:55:28.117 --> 00:55:29.918]  And I just know our greatest work has yet to come.
[00:55:31.056 --> 00:55:33.078]  And uh, but I know it's all in God's plan.
[00:55:33.959 --> 00:55:35.061]  It's all in God's plan.
[00:55:36.102 --> 00:55:39.746]  And I'm gonna have to, you know, really make some big decisions here soon.
[00:55:39.766 --> 00:55:43.290]  Uh, you're gonna have to make some big decisions whether to keep this show on the air.
[00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:54.760]   Another big way to support the broadcast is you get Steven Crowder's investigative unit, his show, The Hodge Twins, all the other great comedy shows they've got, and you get My once a week show, we're going to be expanding there.
[00:55:56.102 --> 00:55:59.770]  And so please go to jonescrowder.com, get a free month when you sign up there.
[00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:00.792]  Here's a promo for it.
[00:56:02.005 --> 00:56:09.567]   We're gonna do a deep dive, not in my words, but in RFK Jr.' 's words, on what he really stands for and who he really is.
[00:56:10.167 --> 00:56:14.588]  This is treason, and we need to start treating them now as traitors.
[00:56:15.268 --> 00:56:18.429]  Do I think the Koch brothers should be prosecuted for reckless endangerment?
[00:56:19.009 --> 00:56:19.709]  Absolutely.
[00:56:19.749 --> 00:56:20.909]  That's a criminal offense.
[00:56:21.269 --> 00:56:26.689]   I've got major, major, major Concerns about RFK Jr.
[00:56:27.289 --> 00:56:33.515]  We should be proud in our state that we've gotten somebody of the quality and the timbre and the character of Hillary Clinton.
[00:56:34.176 --> 00:56:35.618]  Oh, I'm solidly for Hillary.
[00:56:35.818 --> 00:56:38.620]  I think Hillary is going to be a very, very good president.
[00:56:39.181 --> 00:56:42.584]  Maybe he's just a chameleon, but I'm sick of chameleons.
[00:56:43.125 --> 00:56:47.869]  I think vaccines should be subject to the same level of rigorous testing.
[00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:49.931]  There's other medications.
[00:56:50.111 --> 00:56:51.892]  We now have an open border here.
[00:56:52.212 --> 00:56:53.973]  There are people being drawn here.
[00:56:54.554 --> 00:56:55.654]  They're being abused.
[00:56:56.195 --> 00:56:59.337]  And your treatment are two things that are bound to kill you.
[00:57:00.357 --> 00:57:02.378]  Ventilators and remdesivir.
[00:57:02.879 --> 00:57:04.320]  Anecdotally, it appears...
[00:57:05.385 --> 00:57:10.208]  And almost every one of these shooters were on SRIs or some other psychiatric drug.
[00:57:10.488 --> 00:57:12.970]  And Tony Fauci knew that Remdesivir would kill you.
[00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:18.913]  He says that to conservative audiences, but then doesn't say that when he's on big national shows.
[00:57:19.354 --> 00:57:24.497]  You can go into your car and borrow the stored electricity in your car.
[00:57:24.817 --> 00:57:26.058]  So we need to build a smart grid.
[00:57:26.138 --> 00:57:30.200]  We always hear America's racist and evil, but then everybody from the rest of the world wants to move here.
[00:57:30.721 --> 00:57:36.823]   There's a larger globalist plan to discredit America, because the idea of America is antithetical to the new world order of the globalists.
[00:57:36.823 --> 00:57:42.263]   So I started wanting to play on here some of the mass murders and massacres and what goes on in
[00:57:42.263 --> 00:57:46.423]   countries outside America. There's just thousands of clips and the crime statistics are insane.
[00:57:46.423 --> 00:57:52.822]   This is one of the thousands of unregulated, unmonitored mines in the DRC.
[00:57:52.822 --> 00:58:01.703]  It's crawling with children working like modern day slaves.
[00:58:01.903 --> 00:58:03.125]  I'm not out to get the Jews.
[00:58:03.185 --> 00:58:04.206]  I'm out to get my neighbor.
[00:58:04.646 --> 00:58:08.050]  But if my neighbor wanted money out of my wallet every month, I'd probably start disliking him.
[00:58:08.871 --> 00:58:10.572]  I'm tired of one-way streets.
[00:58:11.353 --> 00:58:14.797]  Yeah, you're gonna bless me with a million refugees from Gaza?
[00:58:15.217 --> 00:58:20.823]   You can take your Ilhan Omar's Benjamin Netanyahu and Shove them up your ass.
[00:58:21.263 --> 00:58:21.924]  I have rights.
[00:58:22.204 --> 00:58:22.764]  I exist.
[00:58:23.165 --> 00:58:25.927]  I'm just as valuable as a Muslim or a Jew.
[00:58:26.087 --> 00:58:33.314]  The Muslims, on average, are saying they are allowed to rape and murder Jews, and that they're not humans, and keep their women as sex slaves.
[00:58:33.674 --> 00:58:35.676]  And that Israel wants to ship these people here!
[00:58:36.337 --> 00:58:42.863]  So the Ayatollah Khomeini can also crawl up Netanyahu's ass, and we'll have it for Duncan.
[00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:51.033]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, November 10th.
[00:58:51.813 --> 00:58:52.854]  I've been shadowbanned.
[00:58:53.674 --> 00:58:54.935]  I've been called a liar.
[00:58:55.295 --> 00:58:59.778]  I've been silenced on virtually every platform created by man.
[00:58:59.798 --> 00:59:02.160]  My life has been threatened, repeatedly.
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:05.882]  They've tried to destroy me, but I survived.
[00:59:05.982 --> 00:59:08.804]  And that's why I'm joining Mug Club.
[00:59:10.396 --> 00:59:13.097]  The replatforming begins now!
[00:59:13.137 --> 00:59:18.760]  Join Mug Club and get one month free with promo code ALEX at jonescrowder.com.
[00:59:21.222 --> 00:59:28.626]  Well, Laura Loomer caught the judge in New York persecuting Trump with his pants down.
[00:59:30.747 --> 00:59:32.167]  Both literally and figuratively.
[00:59:34.469 --> 00:59:35.629]  That's coming up.
[00:59:35.649 --> 00:59:36.910]  She'll pop in next hour.
[00:59:38.723 --> 00:59:46.671]  I intend to give the phone number out to cover the news and the issues that we've broken down here so far and to get your take on it.
[00:59:46.691 --> 00:59:48.752]  But wow, Steve Bannon said something.
[00:59:50.034 --> 00:59:53.577]  By the way, Roger Stone's on in the fourth hour with Joel Gilbert.
[00:59:54.818 --> 00:59:56.059]  They got some big breaking news there.
[00:59:58.722 --> 01:00:02.345]  But Steve Bannon said something a few weeks ago that I meant to air.
[01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:02.926]  I never aired it.
[01:00:04.551 --> 01:00:20.821]  But he basically said, when you're around your friends, your family, your neighbors, strangers, you name it, and you're a populist, you're a conservative, you're somebody that's opposed the New World Order, and opposed Biden, you should let them know, hey, I was right, and you should listen to me, and we're in a lot of trouble.
[01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:24.803]  Don't just wait till Thanksgiving or Christmas comes up.
[01:00:26.524 --> 01:00:27.645]  You need to activate.
[01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:31.347]  And I'm telling you, you've already seen how scared the Globalist are.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:55.464]  In the last three years since they stole the election, when people go to school board meetings, and people go to county commission meetings, and those videos go viral of people getting in their face, and retired military, and cops, and everybody up there speaking about, and homekeepers, homemakers, just everybody, black, white, old, young, Hispanic, Asian, you name it.
[01:00:55.864 --> 01:00:57.904]  We're the majority, and people are really waking up right now.
[01:00:57.924 --> 01:00:59.204]  I'm not putting a pretty face on this.
[01:00:59.525 --> 01:01:01.725]  Things are bad, but the awakening is insane.
[01:01:02.765 --> 01:01:03.225]  It's huge.
[01:01:05.046 --> 01:01:09.488]  And that's why they're coming down on everybody like a ton of bricks, folks, because they're losing.
[01:01:10.628 --> 01:01:12.669]  And the end of their global debt bubble is here.
[01:01:13.769 --> 01:01:18.071]  They need to get rid of the yen and the yuan and the euro and the dollar.
[01:01:18.311 --> 01:01:48.816]   They've all been racing to the trilateral commission that was set up in the 70s by Zbigniew Brzezinski and David Rockefeller that would coordinate the central banks And that's why, whether you're in Japan, or whether you're in China, or whether you're in Europe, or whether you're in the UK, or whether you're in Canada, or whether you're in Australia, whether you're in New Zealand, whether you're in the US, they made the decision to incrementally, but it accelerates, and now it's at warp speed, print unlimited money.
[01:01:48.876 --> 01:01:52.958]  But they give it to the central banks and the big companies and BlackRock first.
[01:01:54.398 --> 01:02:09.051]   They buy up real assets, infrastructure, intellectual property, land, farming, energy, Education, media, information warfare, and then they hand you the inflation afterwards and the national debt.
[01:02:11.772 --> 01:02:22.276]  Joe Biden, after one year in office, produced 25% of the money supply in U.S.
[01:02:22.316 --> 01:02:23.397]  history in 240 years.
[01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:39.152]  Since then, look it up, Joe Biden and his controllers, the private Federal Reserve, have created 70%, it's like 69 last time I checked a month ago, so I would imagine it's 70 now.
[01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:42.395]  69% of the money issued in U.S.
[01:02:42.655 --> 01:02:48.319]  history has been issued in the last three years.
[01:02:48.779 --> 01:02:49.700]  Let me say that again.
[01:02:52.001 --> 01:03:06.113]   Upwards of 70% of the money supply ever created in US history has been created in less than three years.
[01:03:09.176 --> 01:03:11.939]  Argentina was once more wealthy than us until they did this.
[01:03:12.499 --> 01:03:13.880]  Venezuela was as wealthy.
[01:03:15.202 --> 01:03:17.624]  People look at Latin America and they say, why can't they get their act together?
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:34.708]  Big multinational banks came in, the IMF, the World Bank, made deals with their politicians who bought giant Swiss chateaus to artificially put them into debt and set them on a course for economic ruin and 50% unemployment.
[01:03:36.289 --> 01:03:37.990]  And that's what the EU countries are doing.
[01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:39.211]  It's what we're doing.
[01:03:39.611 --> 01:03:40.672]  It's a plan.
[01:03:41.152 --> 01:03:44.874]  It's hard for them to hold us down and run the cities into the ground.
[01:03:46.178 --> 01:03:50.801]  To ship the fentanyl in and defund the police and fund all this burn-down-the-city garbage.
[01:03:50.841 --> 01:03:54.063]  And, oh, we're not going to prosecute people that steal less than $5,000.
[01:03:54.644 --> 01:03:59.947]  So, oh, I can go in and just rob all the stores and the restaurants and walk out and not pay for food.
[01:04:01.408 --> 01:04:02.969]  And homeless can sleep wherever they want.
[01:04:04.210 --> 01:04:04.791]  I went to L.A.
[01:04:04.811 --> 01:04:05.951]  Skid Row like four years ago.
[01:04:06.032 --> 01:04:06.652]  Put a report out.
[01:04:06.672 --> 01:04:07.352]  We ought to re-air it.
[01:04:08.573 --> 01:04:10.455]  And it was something I couldn't even have imagined.
[01:04:10.955 --> 01:04:15.158]  You could walk for 30 minutes in any direction around the police station.
[01:04:16.124 --> 01:04:17.264]  That's where it's all epicentered.
[01:04:17.525 --> 01:04:21.966]  Then there's shantytowns all over the place, all over the country now, but all over California.
[01:04:22.227 --> 01:04:25.328]  Anywhere you drive, you see shantytowns in the hills, the underpasses.
[01:04:26.568 --> 01:04:34.452]  And people were doing that fentanyl thing where they stand there but are hung over with their head to the ground.
[01:04:35.572 --> 01:04:39.214]  And you'd see what looked like 18-year-old women with huge black circles around their eyes.
[01:04:40.134 --> 01:04:49.194]  They're saying, you know, for prostitution, with drool running down their face, and then big new Escalades, and the pimps, and the drug dealers, and I had an off-duty.
[01:04:50.425 --> 01:04:50.585]  L.A.
[01:04:50.625 --> 01:04:52.326]  cop with us, that was our security.
[01:04:52.946 --> 01:04:55.007]  And he said, yeah, we're not allowed to go in here and bust them.
[01:04:55.427 --> 01:04:57.068]  We'll be fired if we do.
[01:04:57.948 --> 01:05:01.590]  And the people just throw the food and chicken bones out in the street.
[01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:02.950]  There's maggots everywhere.
[01:05:03.331 --> 01:05:04.551]  Piles of feces.
[01:05:05.071 --> 01:05:07.292]  And then all these disabled people in wheelchairs.
[01:05:07.833 --> 01:05:11.814]  And they're, you know, paralyzed from the stomach down.
[01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:13.815]  And they're trying to live there.
[01:05:14.756 --> 01:05:43.816]   And then coming out of a tent, I turn around and I see this, I couldn't tell if it was Indian or Hispanic or what he was, but he had gray skin, and he was wearing a skirt, and he had a bra on, and there was another transvestite behind him, and he looked like a skeleton, and he had rotholes all in his arms, you could see veins, and rotholes in his stomach, and you could see his spine.
[01:05:44.296 --> 01:05:45.677]  Probably weighed 75 pounds, 80 pounds.
[01:05:48.004 --> 01:05:51.126]  And he had, like, one tooth and slobber coming out.
[01:05:52.506 --> 01:05:54.007]  And they're like, ooh, look out.
[01:05:54.107 --> 01:06:01.251]  I turn around, he's like, uh, uh, yeah, I'll, he said, you know, I'll perform fellatio on you.
[01:06:01.611 --> 01:06:04.252]  I just, I'll suck your dick.
[01:06:04.412 --> 01:06:05.813]  And you can smell it.
[01:06:06.473 --> 01:06:08.394]  And I started vomiting.
[01:06:08.434 --> 01:06:10.315]  And then I just say, the shoot's over.
[01:06:10.575 --> 01:06:11.576]  And I start running.
[01:06:13.277 --> 01:06:14.877]  I actually met my match.
[01:06:14.937 --> 01:06:15.738]  I had a panic attack.
[01:06:17.288 --> 01:06:22.751]  Urine everywhere, stench, mites, just trash everywhere.
[01:06:26.193 --> 01:06:36.739]  And the demonic look in that creature's eyes, which I'm sure is dead now, and the big fat tranny behind him with his penis hanging out.
[01:06:37.892 --> 01:06:39.053]  Because imagine, like, hey, look out!
[01:06:39.534 --> 01:06:41.816]  I'm sitting there interviewing some old man in a wheelchair.
[01:06:42.136 --> 01:06:43.338]  Well, how long have you been out here?
[01:06:43.518 --> 01:06:44.859]  I've been out here five years.
[01:06:44.919 --> 01:06:45.360]  It's terrible.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.061]  You know, my girlfriend's in there.
[01:06:47.081 --> 01:06:49.924]  She's paralyzed, too, but we don't use drugs, but it's hell out here.
[01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:52.046]  And I was like, look out!
[01:06:53.528 --> 01:06:54.949]  And you just go, oh, and you look.
[01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:55.870]  I only looked for like two.
[01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:58.073]  I was just like, what the hell is this?
[01:06:59.639 --> 01:07:04.340]  The stomach on the guy looked like melted gray candle wax.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:13.742]  And I remember only like two seconds scanning it going... And I was like, this is more horrifying than any movie I've ever seen.
[01:07:14.282 --> 01:07:14.903]  Any horror.
[01:07:15.923 --> 01:07:16.843]  And the stench.
[01:07:21.284 --> 01:07:25.185]  And what was clearly semen all over his face.
[01:07:26.985 --> 01:07:28.686]  They just crawled out of a tent.
[01:07:30.282 --> 01:07:38.185]  Where this big, fat man dressed as a woman had just had sex with a dying, reanimated corpse.
[01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:39.705]  Zombie sex.
[01:07:41.586 --> 01:07:42.326]  And that's what it said.
[01:07:42.366 --> 01:07:52.710]  It was just a, uh, yeah, as I turned, it was like, uh, it was like, I'm not going to repeat it on air, but it was like, I'll suck your, and F-U-C-E.
[01:07:55.342 --> 01:07:59.886]  Came to me, as I'm turning in the stench, and it's like, ugh, that sucks like me!
[01:08:00.146 --> 01:08:01.547]  It didn't want to eat my brains!
[01:08:01.807 --> 01:08:03.709]  It was, ugh, ugh, you know.
[01:08:05.450 --> 01:08:07.472]  It's the most horrifying thing I've ever seen in my life.
[01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:13.317]  And it's off-limits to the police.
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:17.660]  And I began to run.
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.342]  I began to vomit.
[01:08:20.834 --> 01:08:30.197]  And it was embarrassing because I had the cop with me and my security and I said I need to pull over at a gas station and I went in the bathroom and I started crying and throwing up again.
[01:08:32.778 --> 01:08:34.218]  For the sorrow for humanity.
[01:08:37.759 --> 01:08:43.761]  And I said go to the liquor store and I got a whole bottle of vodka and I drank it in like 10 minutes and I passed out in the back of the car.
[01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:47.562]  We're so screwed, man.
[01:08:47.642 --> 01:08:49.063]  This is pure Satan, folks.
[01:08:50.043 --> 01:08:50.623]  Pure Satan.
[01:08:51.243 --> 01:08:51.743]  Pure.
[01:08:52.424 --> 01:08:53.804]  The smell of dead flesh.
[01:08:55.064 --> 01:09:06.427]  A literal skeleton with the skin dripping off of it that some fat sex terrorist had come there to have sex with.
[01:09:07.387 --> 01:09:34.396]   And the reason I had that rare panic attack years ago, we've been there many different skin rows many times, Was because the government and the senior detective that's a listener and a great guy we've used when we were in California, he explained to me, you know, all the major cities allow this to go on, and they allow the drug dealing, they allow the prostitution, and this isn't like some high-end prostitution thing where the woman is in control or whatever.
[01:09:34.796 --> 01:10:00.133]   This is all these young girls, and then all these handicapped people, and all these mentally ill people, and crap and feces everywhere, and just Zombie like people walking around on fentanyl and with needle holes just I mean I mean folks you you we didn't get footage of that because we ran I'm there where's Alex going I just started running I said we're done we're out of here I can't handle this and
[01:10:02.722 --> 01:10:26.506]   Now like Steven Crowder a year later came to Austin during the lockdowns and he wanted to go to a tour of all the giant homeless camps and I started like having a flashback and I'm not trying to be like a victim here I'm just being honest I started throwing up on camera and I said I gotta go I can't do this I can't go in the homeless camps because once you've smelled the smell of mites and what the smell they put off Because they defecate all over everything.
[01:10:27.127 --> 01:10:30.949]  And I've been told by cops and people and paramedics, so that's the smell of mites.
[01:10:31.009 --> 01:10:32.130]  That's the smell that makes you sick.
[01:10:32.170 --> 01:10:32.910]  It makes us sick.
[01:10:33.311 --> 01:10:34.111]  It's all over them.
[01:10:34.131 --> 01:10:35.512]  They got mites all over them.
[01:10:35.812 --> 01:10:37.813]  And they drink your blood and then crap it out.
[01:10:37.893 --> 01:10:41.516]  I mean, you just, folks, you have no idea.
[01:10:42.056 --> 01:10:50.521]  And imagine, they charge the police with going and just overseeing this like they're a referee in these crazy towns.
[01:10:51.482 --> 01:10:52.683]  And then people attack the police.
[01:10:54.042 --> 01:10:55.443]  Well, the good people are quitting.
[01:10:56.404 --> 01:10:57.845]  And then who are you gonna get that's gonna be a cop?
[01:10:57.865 --> 01:10:59.086]  They're gonna sit in their squad car.
[01:10:59.987 --> 01:11:01.528]  Because that's all they're allowed to do.
[01:11:01.809 --> 01:11:07.193]  You know, I said I'd take calls, but I don't know now if I'm gonna have time with all the news I gotta cover.
[01:11:07.713 --> 01:11:21.165]  And... I'm not depressed here on air today, but... I'm just being completely real with people that... We're a cursed nation.
[01:11:22.389 --> 01:11:23.630]  And we're not a first world nation.
[01:11:24.211 --> 01:11:25.372]  We're not even a third world nation.
[01:11:25.432 --> 01:11:26.673]  We are a demonic nation.
[01:11:28.474 --> 01:11:38.102]  And... Can you guys get the, uh... I forget the name of the song.
[01:11:38.162 --> 01:11:39.544]  It's, are the good times really over?
[01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:40.785]  By Merle Haggard.
[01:11:41.745 --> 01:11:46.469]  Stop going downhill like a snowball headed for hell.
[01:11:47.731 --> 01:11:54.953]  I can't find the exact title, just Merle Haggart lyrics, Snowball, Headed for Hell, that'll give you the name of the song.
[01:11:55.594 --> 01:11:57.074]  I think it's for the good times over for sure.
[01:11:57.094 --> 01:12:03.076]  And, you know, I think we've been having too many good times.
[01:12:04.317 --> 01:12:07.258]  We've been ignoring evil around us, we've been ignoring problems around us.
[01:12:07.638 --> 01:12:09.418]  God knows I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.
[01:12:10.179 --> 01:12:10.999]  Could have been a better father.
[01:12:11.019 --> 01:12:14.060]  I was pretty good, I'd give myself a B minus.
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.101]  Hell, compared to most dads, I was a good dad, but I wasn't.
[01:12:19.718 --> 01:12:21.199]  Because what's Hank Williams Jr.
[01:12:21.239 --> 01:12:21.479]  say?
[01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:28.344]  My grandpa taught me how to live off the land, and he has taught him to be a businessman.
[01:12:31.666 --> 01:12:41.213]  Most important thing is to know how to skin a buck, run a trot line, have a farm, take care of your children, protect your family, and stay out of the New World Order.
[01:12:41.853 --> 01:12:47.717]  And with the central bank digital currencies going in, and the Mark of the Beast folks, you're going to be sitting here in a couple years.
[01:12:47.877 --> 01:12:48.878]  You don't have to wait long now.
[01:12:49.795 --> 01:12:57.340]  When your money doesn't work anywhere but a couple of big Amazon stores and they're going to gouge you and most of the food on the shelves is going to be bug protein.
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:04.064]  You got to stand in line for five hours to go pay $200 for two ounces of red meat.
[01:13:05.145 --> 01:13:05.846]  That's their plan.
[01:13:06.306 --> 01:13:10.609]  They're going to take everything we got because we didn't stand up for ourselves.
[01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:15.392]  You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything.
[01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:25.255]  And you hear those country songs back before the country fell, and you think, oh, that's just cheesy.
[01:13:25.875 --> 01:13:27.256]  But then you realize how real it is.
[01:13:27.276 --> 01:13:34.643]  I remember growing up with my family, weren't prideful people, but they were definitely proud of Texas.
[01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:38.166]  And they were definitely proud of how upright and good they were.
[01:13:38.186 --> 01:13:39.647]  And I thought everybody's like this.
[01:13:40.027 --> 01:13:41.148]  My family didn't lie.
[01:13:41.429 --> 01:13:42.129]  They didn't cheat.
[01:13:42.389 --> 01:13:43.170]  They didn't steal.
[01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:43.991]  They were tough.
[01:13:44.231 --> 01:13:45.112]  They were hardworking.
[01:13:45.292 --> 01:13:46.013]  You can believe them.
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:51.103]  That was my only handicap growing up, is I thought the rest of the world was like my family.
[01:13:51.623 --> 01:13:52.684]  And now I realize it's not.
[01:13:53.124 --> 01:13:54.645]  We were already rotten back then.
[01:13:56.867 --> 01:13:57.587]  And my family knew.
[01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:01.390]  I know the listeners of this show come from good families.
[01:14:01.450 --> 01:14:06.233]  Some of you are black, some of you are white, some of you are Hispanic, Asian, you name it, but you came from good families.
[01:14:07.254 --> 01:14:10.496]  And that's the only reason you tune in, it's the only reason you know what's going on, it's because you're family.
[01:14:12.778 --> 01:14:17.061]  And you know, I've said we should double down and have children in the midst of all this evil and not give up, because they want us to give up.
[01:14:18.254 --> 01:14:23.795]  But when we do have children in this fight, and we do put them in this world, it means we gotta protect them.
[01:14:25.396 --> 01:14:26.456]  And lead them safely to the light.
[01:14:27.916 --> 01:14:29.297]  Don't let the darkness take them.
[01:14:30.117 --> 01:14:31.817]  Don't let them feel forsaken.
[01:14:32.617 --> 01:14:35.238]  Just lead them safely to the light.
[01:14:36.738 --> 01:14:43.120]  When this whole world is blown asunder, please remember that I really love you.
[01:14:46.636 --> 01:14:48.177]  That's another great song by the High Woman.
[01:14:49.538 --> 01:14:55.262]  And you listen to that music and that culture and the love and the depth and the soul and the reality of it.
[01:14:57.483 --> 01:15:02.066]  Of a Little Richard or a Waylon Jennings.
[01:15:05.069 --> 01:15:09.392]  But you don't see that same spirit in the music and the culture now, because it's all satanic.
[01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:12.294]  Yeah, back then, they just wanted to have pride in things we made again.
[01:15:13.095 --> 01:15:14.556]  Now, can we even have cars?
[01:15:15.497 --> 01:15:17.698]  See how when you give up on quality, you give up on everything?
[01:15:20.501 --> 01:15:21.501]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:23.643 --> 01:15:27.086]  Let's get into the World Government and the Cashless Society control grid.
[01:15:28.807 --> 01:15:31.389]  Here's the Dutch EU Parliament member, Rob Roos.
[01:15:32.679 --> 01:15:34.502]  I have some very bad news to report to you.
[01:15:34.522 --> 01:15:35.002]  Here it is.
[01:15:36.445 --> 01:15:42.033]  I just left the room where we had the negotiations about the digital identity.
[01:15:42.473 --> 01:15:43.695]  And I have bad news.
[01:15:44.296 --> 01:15:47.881]  The Member States and the European Parliament came to an agreement.
[01:15:49.355 --> 01:15:56.078]  That means that, probably not far from now, the digital identity will be a fact in the European Union.
[01:15:57.199 --> 01:16:05.342]  Right after this agreement, Commissioner Breton said, now we have the digital identity wallet, we have to put something in it.
[01:16:06.103 --> 01:16:12.166]  And what he meant was the digital euro, also known as the central bank digital currency.
[01:16:13.546 --> 01:16:15.628]  And this is a very bad development.
[01:16:15.848 --> 01:16:18.650]  They always promise us not to make this connection.
[01:16:19.932 --> 01:16:34.143]  And even a lot of experts, privacy experts and security experts, warned also last week this is a very bad idea for our privacy and our freedom.
[01:16:35.644 --> 01:16:39.708]  And still this digital identity is pushed through.
[01:16:42.256 --> 01:16:47.300]  But it's not too late, because we still have to vote on this in the plenary.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:59.609]  So what you can do, send your MEP from your member state an email and tell him or tell her that you are against this tool.
[01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:16.916]   Now some people, because I see the comments and I've talked to folks on the street, I get the calls, they say, why do I care of Australia or Europe puts in a digital ID, or common as China, on a digital currency.
[01:17:17.736 --> 01:17:31.407]  Well, the IMF, the World Bank, Bill Gates and the UN run by China, look it up, have created a global standardized digital currency that tracks and controls and decides where you can spend your money and can devalue it at any time.
[01:17:32.468 --> 01:17:37.112]  And they admit is the holy grail of total control over the public with a social credit score.
[01:17:39.718 --> 01:17:47.045]  It takes the tyranny we're under right now and makes it look like a cocktail party.
[01:17:50.328 --> 01:18:01.438]  And they're voting it through right now in the EU and saying, I played the clips, that once they have this in place they're going to use it for social control immediately.
[01:18:02.216 --> 01:18:06.399]  Which you've already seen, with the debanking, and the censorship, and the surveillance.
[01:18:06.479 --> 01:18:08.300]  And they know everything you buy, everything you do.
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:15.145]  I mean, it's so fabulously horrible, that there's not even words to describe this.
[01:18:16.445 --> 01:18:19.047]  And it's all bringing the old currencies to an end.
[01:18:19.067 --> 01:18:23.030]  And look, I see the numbers all the time put out by the Federal Reserve.
[01:18:24.171 --> 01:18:24.851]  And time flies.
[01:18:25.772 --> 01:18:28.814]  I said in the first year, Biden devalued the currency.
[01:18:30.077 --> 01:18:31.078]  30-something percent.
[01:18:31.098 --> 01:18:32.679]  It varies on the month.
[01:18:33.839 --> 01:18:34.600]  And that it was up to 70%.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:37.301]  And see, I hadn't looked at this in a while.
[01:18:37.361 --> 01:18:38.502]  I guess I have the numbers wrong.
[01:18:40.203 --> 01:18:41.083]  The crew pulled it up.
[01:18:43.285 --> 01:18:46.206]  It's mainstream news.
[01:18:46.226 --> 01:18:46.867]  80% of U.S.
[01:18:46.907 --> 01:18:49.769]  dollars were printed in the last two years.
[01:18:50.509 --> 01:18:51.850]  How do we know that, and what does it mean?
[01:18:53.373 --> 01:18:56.515]  But if you average together the digital currency issuance, it's still around 70.
[01:18:56.816 --> 01:19:00.518]  The point is, this is devastating inflation.
[01:19:01.639 --> 01:19:12.408]  And the globalists hide it because they get the money, they use it to buy infrastructure and very expensive systems, but it still passes on to the public.
[01:19:13.609 --> 01:19:14.469]  So it's a big deal.
[01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:18.993]  So you think I'm up here going, oh, upwards of 70% of the dollars have just been made in the last few years.
[01:19:19.353 --> 01:19:19.933]  I'm sorry, it's 80%.
[01:19:22.622 --> 01:19:24.063]  Now here's Tony Blair.
[01:19:27.205 --> 01:19:30.867]  Tony Blair says people who need digital IDs to prove disease status in future.
[01:19:31.307 --> 01:19:42.914]  So again, and the UN admits this, the entire COVID attack was about UN treaties and about global digital IDs that's the foundation of this system.
[01:19:43.534 --> 01:19:44.194]  So here's Tony Blair.
[01:19:45.615 --> 01:19:55.039]   You can create a digital ID today that is Much more easily protected, so you can deal with a lot of the privacy and surveillance issues that worry people.
[01:19:55.479 --> 01:20:03.344]  But it's a natural evolution of the way that we're going to use technology in any event to transact daily life.
[01:20:03.764 --> 01:20:06.686]  And this COVID crisis gives an additional reason for doing that.
[01:20:06.786 --> 01:20:20.460]   Because, look, I could be wrong about this, but when I look at, for example, how you restart some businesses, how you restart international travel, I think People's disease status, for example, have they been tested?
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.900]  What is the result of that test?
[01:20:22.601 --> 01:20:23.561]  Have they had the disease?
[01:20:23.601 --> 01:20:24.522]  Do they have the disease?
[01:20:24.862 --> 01:20:35.567]  I think unless you're able to record some of this data in a way that people can use, it's going to be difficult to go back to anything like a near normal.
[01:20:36.647 --> 01:20:50.256]  Let's move on to the other pieces of the puzzle.
[01:20:50.416 --> 01:20:53.538]  They're not just going to ban your beef and things and make you get bugs.
[01:20:54.499 --> 01:21:10.609]   All over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Sweden, they're changing the zoning rules and saying if you want a new zoning permit, The last few years in Austin, you just have one parking space for a house.
[01:21:11.389 --> 01:21:12.649]  Now, no parking spaces.
[01:21:12.689 --> 01:21:13.689]  I meant to cover that Monday.
[01:21:13.709 --> 01:21:15.890]  It was a big headline in local news.
[01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.230]  Oh!
[01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:22.211]  City of Austin bans new houses having parking spaces.
[01:21:23.552 --> 01:21:25.052]  And then I've got clips right here.
[01:21:25.072 --> 01:21:31.613]  I've got Scotland, I've got Ireland, I've got California announcing it into private car ownership.
[01:21:32.514 --> 01:21:33.514]  And they say it right there.
[01:21:36.055 --> 01:21:41.622]  Meanwhile in Israel, a woman arrested and put in jail over social media posts saying she supports Palestine.
[01:21:42.463 --> 01:21:47.088]  I'm going to criticize what Israel is doing as a totalitarian and what the Muslims are doing as a totalitarian.
[01:21:47.108 --> 01:21:50.812]  The point is, is that this stuff is spreading everywhere.
[01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:51.713]  Here's another one.
[01:21:52.054 --> 01:22:01.412]   WEF Young Global Leader Ida Aukin Agenda coordinator, why would you want to own a cell phone if you can just lease it?
[01:22:01.572 --> 01:22:02.593]  Oh, somebody else owns your data.
[01:22:03.033 --> 01:22:08.016]  If you lease, why shouldn't you lease your refrigerator or your washing machine or your dishwasher?
[01:22:08.516 --> 01:22:09.857]  Why would you want to own it?
[01:22:10.177 --> 01:22:12.298]  So it'll all be based on your social credit score.
[01:22:12.558 --> 01:22:18.941]  You'll have no money, but don't worry, they'll let you have the good if you behave the way they want for now.
[01:22:21.363 --> 01:22:28.800]   And they get up there like Lex Luthor supervillains, wish they were, and say, The next thing we're going to cut off is the water.
[01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:30.701]  Water shouldn't be inexpensive.
[01:22:30.741 --> 01:22:31.922]  We're going to make it expensive.
[01:22:34.404 --> 01:22:42.189]  And if you're against it, like the Spanish leader of the party set to win elections that the Socialist Party turned out on, you get shot in the face.
[01:22:43.570 --> 01:22:44.870]  This just happened yesterday.
[01:22:45.291 --> 01:22:52.035]  Spain's right-wing party, Voxco, founder, shot in the face on the way to protest Socialist's plan to take over government.
[01:22:52.555 --> 01:22:54.617]  I guess that's easier than indicting the guy.
[01:22:56.010 --> 01:22:58.111]  Who's set to win the runoff election.
[01:22:57.951 --> 01:23:07.630]  who's a patriot in Argentina.
[01:23:07.630 --> 01:23:09.150]  All backed by the biggest banks.
[01:23:09.177 --> 01:23:10.998]  All backed by the most powerful individuals.
[01:23:11.478 --> 01:23:13.239]  All backed by the most powerful corporations.
[01:23:14.819 --> 01:23:16.380]  Coming down on us with both feet.
[01:23:18.701 --> 01:23:20.382]  Now I've got the military news.
[01:23:21.843 --> 01:23:23.744]  Particularly in the Ukraine war.
[01:23:24.824 --> 01:23:25.785]  Coming up next segment.
[01:23:27.515 --> 01:23:32.098]  And then we've got the New York kangaroo judge.
[01:23:32.158 --> 01:23:33.439]  I mean, this is the biggest farce ever.
[01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:35.340]  He's already found Trump guilty.
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:36.061]  There's no jury.
[01:23:36.381 --> 01:23:48.569]  And then he just has testimony, and he sits there like salacious crumb meets the cryptkeeper, giggling and smiling while his wife runs around saying she can't wait to put Trump in jail while they gag Trump, though.
[01:23:48.609 --> 01:23:52.731]  I mean, it's just these people, they have no self-awareness.
[01:23:54.072 --> 01:23:54.573]  We'll be right back.
[01:23:54.593 --> 01:23:54.953]  Stay with us.
[01:23:56.846 --> 01:23:59.628]  It's Friday, November 10, 2023.
[01:24:00.188 --> 01:24:02.730]  We are deep inside the new world order now.
[01:24:05.111 --> 01:24:13.576]  And as the tyranny gets worse and worse, freedom and those that have promoted freedom are going to be like lights in darkness.
[01:24:14.317 --> 01:24:18.199]  We're going to blaze even brighter, long after we're shoveled into our graves.
[01:24:20.941 --> 01:24:29.907]   But everything we do, Before they take out our leadership, yours truly, as well, we'll shine forward into the future.
[01:24:30.708 --> 01:24:33.990]  So work I do today will translate into the future.
[01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:36.052]  That's why I will stay at my post.
[01:24:36.953 --> 01:24:37.853]  I will go down with the ship.
[01:24:38.834 --> 01:24:44.719]  But I've also got to decide at the moment I know that's actually happened, and we're approaching that moment.
[01:24:45.959 --> 01:24:53.497]   That's why it's so easy with this audience who I cannot stand having to come to and beg, I know the economy's in depression.
[01:24:53.597 --> 01:24:54.537]  I know things are terrible.
[01:24:55.498 --> 01:25:01.141]  Our audience has grown back much of where it was when we got taken off everything five years ago.
[01:25:01.902 --> 01:25:04.844]  But every other media outlet, including corporate media, is collapsing.
[01:25:05.624 --> 01:25:09.126]  Independent media is in deep trouble because we're in a depression.
[01:25:10.967 --> 01:25:13.029]  And there's a glut of other voices out there.
[01:25:13.629 --> 01:25:18.392]  But what we cover is the central issues that have been proven the most accurate.
[01:25:19.341 --> 01:25:22.322]  That's why before I hit this news, I need you to make the decision.
[01:25:26.942 --> 01:25:28.363]  And people know I'm not playing games here.
[01:25:31.843 --> 01:25:38.184]  Are you gonna go get the fundraiser book, The Great Awakening, at InfoWarshaw.com, get a signed copy.
[01:25:38.204 --> 01:25:39.005]  That's the fundraiser.
[01:25:41.105 --> 01:25:42.625]  I need to raise a couple million dollars.
[01:25:44.625 --> 01:25:45.226]  It's historic.
[01:25:45.346 --> 01:25:46.186]  You'll get a signed copy.
[01:25:46.226 --> 01:25:47.206]  You'll know you're part of the fight.
[01:25:49.335 --> 01:25:54.898]  Are you going to get Ultra 12, the highest quality B12 out there at 40% off to keep the operation on air?
[01:25:55.599 --> 01:26:00.422]  Are you going to get the Infowars Platinum, the HGH Max Boost, the 1776 Testosterone Boost?
[01:26:00.942 --> 01:26:01.803]  That funds free speech.
[01:26:01.963 --> 01:26:08.127]  And I actually get some of the funds because I paid out of the last money I had to buy that product.
[01:26:10.108 --> 01:26:11.369]  The Pain MD.
[01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:14.351]  These are great products.
[01:26:15.831 --> 01:26:16.392]  And they work.
[01:26:17.052 --> 01:26:18.013]  They do amazing things.
[01:26:19.710 --> 01:26:20.711]  Everybody needs a little silver.
[01:26:20.951 --> 01:26:23.253]  We got the highest quality, 30 parts per million, silver bullet.
[01:26:23.513 --> 01:26:26.095]  We don't make a lot of money off of it, but it's there, it funds the operation.
[01:26:26.395 --> 01:26:26.775]  Get that.
[01:26:27.195 --> 01:26:33.920]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:40.665]  Now, another thing I was right about, and again, it's not about saying I'm right, it's about I'm dialed in, I study this, it's all I do.
[01:26:40.685 --> 01:26:42.666]  I used to have dreams about other stuff.
[01:26:42.686 --> 01:26:44.227]  I used to dream about fighting the globalists now.
[01:26:45.989 --> 01:26:47.530]  And I eat, drink, sleep this stuff.
[01:26:49.414 --> 01:26:55.476]  And I said, I think Russia is going to go in in late February two years ago, or almost two years ago.
[01:26:56.736 --> 01:27:01.117]  And I even had Russian media on a week before they invaded.
[01:27:01.137 --> 01:27:02.738]  And I'm like, I don't believe you.
[01:27:02.798 --> 01:27:03.938]  You are amassing troops.
[01:27:05.398 --> 01:27:08.659]  Because I don't just go with what the Israelis say or the Russians say or the U.S.
[01:27:08.679 --> 01:27:09.159]  government says.
[01:27:09.359 --> 01:27:10.080]  They're governments.
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:11.380]  They're bureaucracies.
[01:27:12.915 --> 01:27:14.576]  You can love America, but hate the government.
[01:27:15.337 --> 01:27:17.678]  You can love Israel, but not like what's happening over there.
[01:27:17.738 --> 01:27:21.401]  You can be for the Arabs and Muslims, but not support Hamas killing people.
[01:27:23.743 --> 01:27:29.467]  And as soon as Russia went in, it was a NATO trap.
[01:27:30.447 --> 01:27:34.350]  And NATO put hundreds of billions of dollars of weapons and training in, and U.S.
[01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:35.811]  troops have been there advising people.
[01:27:36.852 --> 01:27:49.236]   Nine years ago, when the West, Soros was bragging about it on CNN with Reid Zakaria, Five million bucks he got to overthrow the government and then start attacking the Russian borders to get the Russians to come in.
[01:27:49.296 --> 01:27:50.496]  And the Russians took the bait.
[01:27:52.157 --> 01:27:54.238]  They came in, they lost hundreds of thousands of troops.
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:58.520]  But if anything, the Russians will fight.
[01:27:59.801 --> 01:28:02.523]  Hell, the Germans killed 26 million of them.
[01:28:04.964 --> 01:28:14.578]   Like they say in Dr. Strangelove, where Arthur C. Scott Says, hell, them Nazis killed twenty-something million of them and they didn't give up!
[01:28:15.038 --> 01:28:16.419]  We gotta go out there and just nuke them and kill them all!
[01:28:17.659 --> 01:28:18.560]  Guys, pull up the clip.
[01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:22.001]  Dr. Strangelove, look how many of them Nazis killed.
[01:28:22.101 --> 01:28:23.062]  They still didn't give up.
[01:28:24.042 --> 01:28:24.662]  That's the quote.
[01:28:24.982 --> 01:28:34.546]  Which was a movie about real stuff that happened two years before when Curtis LeMay, who's General Jack T. Ripper, and L.L.
[01:28:34.606 --> 01:28:41.006]   Lemditzer, who's George C. Scott, Went to Kennedy and said, we want to go ahead and just blow up U.S.
[01:28:41.046 --> 01:28:47.768]  military bases and shoot up people at movie theaters and blame it on the Cubans so we can start nuclear war with the Russians.
[01:28:47.828 --> 01:28:48.848]  And Kennedy said, you know what?
[01:28:48.888 --> 01:28:49.848]  Your asses are fired.
[01:28:50.429 --> 01:28:51.329]  And they said, you know what?
[01:28:51.789 --> 01:28:52.389]  Go fire.
[01:28:54.130 --> 01:28:55.409]  How's your head doing?
[01:28:55.409 --> 01:29:02.210]  Alright, Mr. President, we gotta go ahead and nuke 'em!
[01:29:02.388 --> 01:29:03.609]  The Russians are never gonna give up!
[01:29:03.989 --> 01:29:05.110]  They're gonna go, absolutely, eh?
[01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:06.471]  We gotta go ahead and just kill them all!
[01:29:06.531 --> 01:29:08.132]  I mean, look how many of those Nazis killed!
[01:29:08.292 --> 01:29:08.892]  They didn't give up.
[01:29:12.614 --> 01:29:14.495]  The number's 25, 27 million killed.
[01:29:16.096 --> 01:29:19.198]  And then people are like, oh, the Russians are gonna give up, we killed 200,000 of them.
[01:29:21.159 --> 01:29:24.041]  And certainly, they've gotten weak like we have, they're not as hard as they were before.
[01:29:25.362 --> 01:29:27.183]  But, they're still harder than the people they're fighting.
[01:29:29.542 --> 01:29:30.962]  And so Russia has won.
[01:29:30.982 --> 01:29:41.345]  And Putin always said, I just want this demilitarized zone where pipelines and infrastructure is, Crimea, the south, up to the east on our border.
[01:29:42.726 --> 01:29:45.487]  And he said, we're setting it up for a trap.
[01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:49.408]  We're going to move in, build our defenses and just let NATO hit us.
[01:29:51.048 --> 01:29:53.169]  And then we're going to destroy NATO's troops.
[01:29:55.850 --> 01:29:56.850]  And Putin has won.
[01:29:58.820 --> 01:29:59.821]  Zelensky is lost.
[01:30:02.022 --> 01:30:10.567]  And now the stories about Zelensky being a cokehead, the stories about Zelensky stealing money are all over the news, and now the Pentagon announced, we're going to start cutting way back the amount of weapons you get.
[01:30:10.587 --> 01:30:22.094]  And Zelensky goes on TV, I thought it was a joke when I saw it three days ago, and says, in English, please give me money, Americans, donate to me, I'll give it back to you later.
[01:30:22.835 --> 01:30:24.956]  Poland's getting ready to divide it with Russia.
[01:30:26.411 --> 01:30:27.412]  That's how this stuff works.
[01:30:28.072 --> 01:30:30.093]  And now Poland's come out, said they're not giving them weapons.
[01:30:30.413 --> 01:30:39.139]  Poland's come out and said, you owe us trillions of dollars for the millions of Poles you helped kill when Ukraine was the main Nazi base in that area of Europe.
[01:30:40.079 --> 01:30:44.582]  And they give standing ovations to a top Nazi in the Ukrainian, in the Canadian parliament.
[01:30:45.042 --> 01:30:47.584]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[01:30:49.177 --> 01:30:53.217]   I always just notice wherever the ADL is, if you just like put a blindfold on and start
[01:30:53.217 --> 01:30:55.617]  touching, "Oh, an actual SS officer?
[01:30:55.617 --> 01:30:57.417]  Oh, an actual Nazi collaborator?
[01:30:57.417 --> 01:30:59.978]  Oh, you know, oh, Schwarzenegger said he loved Hitler?
[01:30:59.978 --> 01:31:05.337]   Oh, well, it's like, you look at the ADL and it's like, they're not Nazis, but they've
[01:31:06.331 --> 01:31:16.074]  I mean, if you're a real Nazi, and you lined up 30,000 Jews, and you, like this SS officer did the standing ovation, he was one of the main leaders.
[01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:19.875]  In one day, they killed 30,000 Jews and shoved them in a pit.
[01:31:20.855 --> 01:31:22.576]  And the ADL goes, we love you.
[01:31:23.156 --> 01:31:25.316]  Thank you, sir.
[01:31:25.697 --> 01:31:26.837]  Oh, love it.
[01:31:27.797 --> 01:31:30.118]  Because I guess that then drives all the Jews down to Israel.
[01:31:32.503 --> 01:31:34.084]  And that's the secret of any of these mafias.
[01:31:34.104 --> 01:31:38.066]  It's like the FBI lets Islamists in to carry out terror, the FBI gets to take over society.
[01:31:38.687 --> 01:31:41.969]  And then, you know, backdoor deals with Zionists and Hitler.
[01:31:42.409 --> 01:31:44.510]  He persecutes the Jews, makes them go to Palestine.
[01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:46.371]  I mean, it's just disgusting.
[01:31:47.772 --> 01:31:51.314]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[01:31:52.695 --> 01:31:56.978]  So, Pentagon starting to restrict flow of military aid to Ukraine as money runs out.
[01:31:59.045 --> 01:32:04.312]  Poland holds up Ukraine-EU membership based on Ukrainian World War II atrocities.
[01:32:05.754 --> 01:32:07.356]  By the way, pull up the Nazi again.
[01:32:08.277 --> 01:32:09.759]  New Lizards Man tuned in and thought, what?
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:23.967]   Canada gave a standing ovation to an SS officer that ran the key brigade that in just one massacre Shot in a ravine, 30,000 Jews over a week, men, women, and children, and buried them with bulldozers.
[01:32:24.548 --> 01:32:42.524]  And then, Zelensky goes and opens a Holocaust museum at that site a few years ago, and then has a standing ovation for the guy, as if everybody doesn't know that Ukraine was on the side of the Nazis in World War II.
[01:32:46.564 --> 01:32:52.609]  But that's how dumb the system thinks you are.
[01:32:52.829 --> 01:32:57.733]  In fact, I'm surprised they don't just take the video down on Twitter or Facebook and say, it's fake news.
[01:32:58.093 --> 01:32:59.194]  But it's not fake news.
[01:33:01.056 --> 01:33:12.445]  So there's a weird relationship, not with your average Zionist out there that just is pro-Jew, pro-Israel, but the leadership and the founding of the Rothschilds, a very sick Hitler relationship going on.
[01:33:12.966 --> 01:33:14.347]  Very disgusting.
[01:33:16.169 --> 01:33:16.910]  We'll find that clip.
[01:33:16.930 --> 01:33:17.390]  We'll play it.
[01:33:17.891 --> 01:33:18.511]  It's all over the place.
[01:33:18.531 --> 01:33:23.816]  You just type in Nazi Gibbon Standing Ovation Nazi Canadian Parliament.
[01:33:23.936 --> 01:33:24.697]  It was a big story.
[01:33:25.057 --> 01:33:27.279]  I know later they'll take it off the internet and say it doesn't exist.
[01:33:27.839 --> 01:33:28.520]  Go ahead and roll the clip.
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:36.087]  Here it is.
[01:33:36.107 --> 01:33:36.087]  98.
[01:33:37.908 --> 01:33:38.889]  Let's just stop there.
[01:33:38.929 --> 01:33:39.750]  Let's just stop there.
[01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:40.551]  We're going to come back.
[01:33:44.278 --> 01:33:44.958]  You know it doesn't exist.
[01:33:44.978 --> 01:33:45.279]  I made it up.
[01:33:45.319 --> 01:33:45.659]  It's fake news.
[01:33:46.279 --> 01:33:46.759]  We can't play it.
[01:33:46.779 --> 01:33:47.080]  It's fine.
[01:33:49.041 --> 01:33:49.441]  Fake news.
[01:33:49.481 --> 01:33:50.121]  I've been called again.
[01:33:50.942 --> 01:33:52.643]  George Soros wasn't a Nazi collaborator.
[01:33:52.663 --> 01:33:54.964]  Arnold Schwarzenegger didn't tell Rolling Stoney he loves Hitler.
[01:33:54.984 --> 01:33:56.305]  His dad wasn't an SS officer.
[01:33:59.746 --> 01:34:02.608]  Zelensky didn't have a top, you know, SS guy thing.
[01:34:02.708 --> 01:34:03.468]  It didn't happen.
[01:34:03.548 --> 01:34:03.949]  It's all true.
[01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:05.029]  Everything's fine, folks.
[01:34:05.049 --> 01:34:05.810]  Drink your fluoride.
[01:34:06.150 --> 01:34:06.770]  Take your shots.
[01:34:06.810 --> 01:34:07.751]  Hell, take more shots.
[01:34:07.991 --> 01:34:09.312]  Just, everything's wonderful.
[01:34:11.853 --> 01:34:13.514]  We're gonna start hour number three.
[01:34:15.012 --> 01:34:19.356]  And we got Laura Limmer coming up, Steve Bannon's coming up, and a lot more.
[01:34:19.436 --> 01:34:20.537]  Infowars.com.
[01:34:20.797 --> 01:34:22.797]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:34:22.797 --> 01:34:42.156]  America's not perfect.
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:45.961]  For instance, the colonies were founded, and the U.S.
[01:34:45.981 --> 01:34:48.002]  was founded off of tobacco and whiskey.
[01:34:49.062 --> 01:34:49.602]  That's a fact.
[01:34:49.662 --> 01:34:51.643]  Sam Adams didn't just produce beer, he produced whiskey.
[01:34:52.003 --> 01:34:56.164]  He was one of the main patrons of George Washington in that war.
[01:34:57.025 --> 01:35:01.086]  George Washington helped pay troops with liquor that he himself produced.
[01:35:01.946 --> 01:35:05.667]  That's an amazing part of Americana, and we should use this responsibly.
[01:35:05.687 --> 01:35:12.847]   You know, sometimes I go four months before I have a cigar, Or before I have a glass of whiskey.
[01:35:13.767 --> 01:35:16.787]  But I tell you, there's a lot of great whiskey out there.
[01:35:17.948 --> 01:35:23.009]  But a few years ago, we ran into some great folks that are craft whiskey producers here in the United States.
[01:35:23.049 --> 01:35:23.729]  We're big listeners.
[01:35:24.369 --> 01:35:34.591]  And they said, we've got some of the best whiskeys produced in Kentucky, Tennessee, you name it, with people that won't turn over their whiskey to anybody else that they want to bring to you.
[01:35:34.971 --> 01:35:37.612]  And these guys put out some of the top names in the country.
[01:35:38.737 --> 01:35:44.321]  Some of the highest end specialties out there that sell for $500, $300 a bottle.
[01:35:44.821 --> 01:35:48.404]  And they said, but because we support you so much, I looked it up, it was true.
[01:35:49.084 --> 01:35:52.566]  We're going to let you sell this to people at a fraction of the price.
[01:35:53.647 --> 01:36:03.073]  We're going to come out with a Kentucky bourbon that is high quality for a fraction of the price because we want to support your broadcast.
[01:36:03.113 --> 01:36:04.094]  And that was about two years ago.
[01:36:04.114 --> 01:36:05.235]  I said, great, let's do it.
[01:36:06.510 --> 01:36:08.391]  Then about a year ago, they bottled it.
[01:36:08.411 --> 01:36:09.871]  It was a very special bottle.
[01:36:09.891 --> 01:36:10.731]  A collector's item.
[01:36:11.251 --> 01:36:12.092]  Conspiracy bourbon.
[01:36:12.952 --> 01:36:16.273]  And they tried to bring it into stores, where they already had their other products.
[01:36:16.773 --> 01:36:17.834]  And all hell broke loose.
[01:36:18.534 --> 01:36:20.895]  And they went through so many attacks trying to bring this to the public.
[01:36:21.715 --> 01:36:28.297]  And that made me go from just letting them use my name to promote this, to me getting fully behind it because they're trying to stop us.
[01:36:29.462 --> 01:36:37.489]  When we just launched this a day ago, they took away the banking of the company with the website ConspiracyBourbon.com, but they had it back up within just an hour.
[01:36:38.049 --> 01:36:40.451]  So they are literally trying to shut this down.
[01:36:40.471 --> 01:36:43.994]  They're so scared of us moving into the culture that the globalists control.
[01:36:44.715 --> 01:36:45.715]  If you don't drink, that's great.
[01:36:45.735 --> 01:36:46.376]  More power to you.
[01:36:46.416 --> 01:36:52.261]  But if you like a good bourbon, you like a good Kentucky bourbon, a good Kentucky whiskey, this is amazing.
[01:36:52.321 --> 01:36:56.251]   And folks, you've got to check out This bottle for yourself.
[01:36:56.911 --> 01:37:01.354]  If you've got a blacklight, this bottle is very, very special.
[01:37:01.994 --> 01:37:10.179]  No one that we've ever heard of has come up with a bottle like this, that when you put a blacklight on it, has all these secret messages.
[01:37:10.959 --> 01:37:17.523]  Yeah, the CIA created the term conspiracy theory to try to demonize people that questioned official narratives after they killed Kennedy.
[01:37:18.264 --> 01:37:23.687]  But now we wear that attack like a badge of honor.
[01:37:24.861 --> 01:37:26.842]  And it's absolutely blown up in the system's face.
[01:37:27.983 --> 01:37:36.549]  So this is the first salvo in a whole product line to really take over the term conspiracy and use it to bring back our republic.
[01:37:36.829 --> 01:37:40.992]  Think of this as the opposite of Anheuser-Busch and Bud Light and Dylan Mulvaney.
[01:37:41.413 --> 01:37:45.215]  Think of this as the anti-Dylan Mulvaney and that's what it is.
[01:37:45.235 --> 01:37:47.077]  There's only 10,000 bottles of this.
[01:37:47.737 --> 01:37:51.301]  I would imagine when many of you see this letter, you'll try to go buy it at ConspiracyBourbon.com.

[01:38:47.361 --> 01:38:48.242]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:38:48.542 --> 01:38:49.022]  Today.
[01:38:53.984 --> 01:38:56.164]  People that are boys... And I don't know what that is.
[01:38:56.204 --> 01:38:57.205]  I've never seen one of those before.
[01:38:57.225 --> 01:39:02.046]  There are people whose gender might be a little bit of both or might even be neither.
[01:39:02.706 --> 01:39:05.707]  Some public schools and libraries invite drag queens.
[01:39:06.188 --> 01:39:10.149]  Some dress like torn demons to read to young children.
[01:39:10.549 --> 01:39:14.051]  Parents' rights are limited, and children's rights are put ahead.
[01:39:14.472 --> 01:39:19.235]  So the child has the right to be protected from the parents when the parents behave badly.
[01:39:19.255 --> 01:39:25.539]  Yeah, that child molester just messed with the wrong preschooler.
[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:28.901]  What makes you think he's a child molester?
[01:39:29.502 --> 01:39:31.123]  Oh, he's a child molester, believe me.
[01:39:31.543 --> 01:39:35.143]  Every child molester I've ever met looks just like that.
[01:39:35.143 --> 01:39:38.743]  And make gay little babies for the whole human race.
[01:39:38.743 --> 01:39:40.343]  Make a world we can live in.
[01:39:40.343 --> 01:39:43.142]  We're the one who you love's not an issue.
[01:39:43.142 --> 01:39:44.142]  Well...
[01:39:43.965 --> 01:39:45.965]  It'll convert your children.
[01:39:45.965 --> 01:39:46.465]  What?
[01:39:46.465 --> 01:39:54.204]   Happens bit by bit, quietly and subtly, and you will barely notice it.
[01:39:54.204 --> 01:40:02.125]   You can keep him from disco, warn about San Francisco, make him wear painted pants, we don't care.
[01:40:02.125 --> 01:40:08.125]   And then you have talk show stars like Joe Rogan who just wing it, who make it up as they go along.
[01:40:08.206 --> 01:40:17.988]  And because figures like Rogan are trusted by people that don't trust real newsrooms, we have a tension, a problem that's much bigger than Spotify, much bigger than any single platform, Kate.
[01:40:18.068 --> 01:40:22.829]  But that's what's at the heart of this r- Dammit, everything on TV sucks.
[01:40:23.849 --> 01:40:25.229]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:29.470]   Oh I
[01:40:29.470 --> 01:40:33.470]   I I

[01:40:46.789 --> 01:40:50.789]   Oh Oh
[01:40:50.789 --> 01:40:55.390]  [Music]
[01:40:55.464 --> 01:40:55.764]  Hello?
[01:40:56.305 --> 01:40:57.065]  You piece of shit!

[01:41:19.859 --> 01:41:21.320]  You think I'm a coward like you?! !
[01:41:23.383 --> 01:41:30.413]  Uh... I... We're... Uh... Whoa!
[01:41:31.134 --> 01:41:33.878]  I just got invited to give the commencement address at Harvard this year.
[01:41:34.058 --> 01:41:35.020]  That's amazing!
[01:41:35.561 --> 01:41:36.561]  I'm gay!
[01:41:36.561 --> 01:41:38.561]   *gay noises* *gay noises*

[01:41:48.561 --> 01:41:50.561]   *gay noises* Let's go get apps!
[01:41:50.769 --> 01:41:51.150]  Alright.
[01:41:51.170 --> 01:41:53.334]  Do you get to wear the hat and everything?
[01:41:53.454 --> 01:41:54.877]  Hi, who's that?
[01:41:54.997 --> 01:41:57.382]  Don't worry.
[01:41:57.282 --> 01:41:57.782]  Hello?
[01:41:57.782 --> 01:42:01.782]   *Squeal* *Roar*
[01:42:01.782 --> 01:42:05.282]  I see you, enemy! I see you, enemy!
[01:42:05.383 --> 01:42:05.824]  Enemy!
[01:42:06.404 --> 01:42:06.844]  Enemy!
[01:42:07.145 --> 01:42:08.486]  You are my enemy!
[01:42:09.006 --> 01:42:09.967]  You will pay!
[01:42:10.007 --> 01:42:11.808]  Yeah, you think I don't see your face, scum?
[01:42:11.828 --> 01:42:13.169]  You don't think I don't see you?
[01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:15.471]  I see you, you understand me?
[01:42:15.591 --> 01:42:17.452]  I know what you think of me and my family.
[01:42:17.832 --> 01:42:18.993]  I see you, right back!
[01:42:19.273 --> 01:42:20.454]  You understand that?
[01:42:20.293 --> 01:42:22.293]  You don't understand that.
[01:42:22.293 --> 01:42:29.293]  You will fall!
[01:42:29.293 --> 01:42:31.293]  You will not bring humanity down!
[01:42:31.293 --> 01:42:33.293]  God will!
[01:42:32.686 --> 01:42:35.286]  is going to destroy you!
[01:42:35.286 --> 01:42:36.785]  (Screaming)
[01:42:37.786 --> 01:42:39.786]  (Mumbling)
[01:42:39.786 --> 01:42:40.286]  Woah!
[01:42:40.286 --> 01:42:41.285]  (Mumbling)
[01:42:41.285 --> 01:42:42.285]  That was cool the way he like...
[01:42:42.285 --> 01:42:44.285]  (Mumbling)
[01:42:44.285 --> 01:42:46.285]  (Mumbling)
[01:42:46.785 --> 01:42:48.786]  (Laughing)
[01:42:48.786 --> 01:43:07.786]  (Music)
[01:43:08.286 --> 01:43:29.786]  (Music)
[01:43:29.786 --> 01:43:33.786]  (Mumbling)
[01:43:34.456 --> 01:43:36.177]  Meets a zombie.
[01:43:37.057 --> 01:43:40.259]  Has gagged Trump when he says, hey, I don't get a jury.
[01:43:40.299 --> 01:43:41.979]  The judge has found me guilty.
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:43.220]  Why is there a jury?
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:43.880]  You're gagged.
[01:43:44.721 --> 01:43:48.582]  Or, hey, your chief law clerk's talking bad about me hanging out with George Soros.
[01:43:48.922 --> 01:43:49.382]  Gagged.
[01:43:50.303 --> 01:43:52.484]  Next time Trump speaks out, he says he's going to jail.
[01:43:52.924 --> 01:43:54.605]  No jury, just a judge.
[01:43:56.385 --> 01:44:02.269]   So Laura Loomer noticed that The Twitter reportedly of his wife attacking Trump was up there.
[01:44:02.289 --> 01:44:03.470]  Now, it's since been locked down.
[01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:05.091]  She's denying it's her Twitter.
[01:44:05.131 --> 01:44:06.491]  But then the woman was on a show last night.
[01:44:06.511 --> 01:44:09.873]  Reportedly, the same person was there going after her then.
[01:44:10.433 --> 01:44:11.374]  This is a big deal.
[01:44:11.414 --> 01:44:14.156]  But I did some searching and digging into this, Laura.
[01:44:14.276 --> 01:44:21.580]  And again, it just shows how they're all rabidly attacking, with Lisa James having press conferences every day, attacking Trump.
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:25.001]   But then Trump's not supposed to have his own Press conferences.
[01:44:25.041 --> 01:44:25.561]  Mistrial.
[01:44:25.581 --> 01:44:28.102]  Well, it should be a mistrial because it's not a jury.
[01:44:28.903 --> 01:44:31.163]  Wife of New York judge presiding over Trump trial.
[01:44:31.423 --> 01:44:33.224]  Presiding over a Trump trial?
[01:44:34.284 --> 01:44:36.305]  He's the judge, jury, and executioner.
[01:44:37.345 --> 01:44:39.626]  Allegedly sharing anti-Trump social media posts.
[01:44:40.026 --> 01:44:40.786]  We have those.
[01:44:40.826 --> 01:44:42.187]  The account's now been locked down.
[01:44:42.207 --> 01:44:46.308]  We'll put the images of those up on screen for people.
[01:44:46.868 --> 01:44:48.569]  But Laura, great investigative work.
[01:44:48.829 --> 01:44:50.089]  One of your many exploits.
[01:44:50.530 --> 01:44:51.370]  Tell us what's going on here.
[01:44:52.401 --> 01:44:55.004]  Yeah, well, thanks so much, Alex, for having me on again.
[01:44:55.044 --> 01:45:03.495]  And as you know, the left and the DOJ are desperate to do anything they can to stop President Trump from becoming president yet again.
[01:45:03.755 --> 01:45:11.925]  And we see that they've weaponized the government so much through all of these ridiculous sham trials that are now taking place all across the country.
[01:45:12.225 --> 01:45:14.144]  efforts to remove him from the ballot.
[01:45:14.144 --> 01:45:18.465]   And one of them is his civil fraud case that's taking place in New York City,
[01:45:18.465 --> 01:45:22.425]   where they're trying to accuse him of committing financial fraud and
[01:45:22.425 --> 01:45:26.425]  overvaluing, right, his properties, including Mar-a-Lago.
[01:45:26.425 --> 01:45:30.744]   And so this judge who is overseeing this trial, his name is Arthur Angaran.
[01:45:30.744 --> 01:45:31.625]  He's a leftist.
[01:45:31.625 --> 01:45:35.505]  He has documented political donations to Democrats.
[01:45:35.586 --> 01:45:46.310]  He has allowed for the media into the courtroom where he's, you know, smiled on camera with Letitia James and has made nasty comments about President Trump being a bad person.
[01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:47.731]  He's gagged President Trump.
[01:45:47.791 --> 01:45:50.972]  He has issued a gag order against President Trump's attorneys.
[01:45:51.572 --> 01:45:57.314]  And, you know, I've been investigating him and I released a report live on my show the other night.
[01:45:58.054 --> 01:46:07.923]  And it was about his newsletter in which I uncovered his personal writings where he once said in January of this year that he was a free speech absolutist, Alex.
[01:46:08.484 --> 01:46:17.072]  And so how can you call yourself a free speech absolutist if you're going to then gag the President of the United States and then also gag his family and his attorney?
[01:46:17.112 --> 01:46:19.174]  So essentially he has no way to defend himself.
[01:46:19.794 --> 01:46:28.058]  And while I was doing this, his wife just couldn't control herself and she was attacking me and Congressman George Santos on my show.
[01:46:28.078 --> 01:46:35.361]  And so it caught my attention, of course, because I was already aware of her Twitter account to begin with and had been doing an investigation.
[01:46:35.861 --> 01:46:44.725]   And I was, you know, I had just been waiting to see when I was going to release all this information because This judge has a newsletter, Alex.
[01:46:44.805 --> 01:46:47.887]  It's called the Wheatley Alumni School Association Newsletter.
[01:46:48.127 --> 01:46:52.871]  And he tries to pretend like this is an academic publication, but he controls it.
[01:46:52.971 --> 01:46:54.512]  And there's hundreds of editions of it.
[01:46:54.552 --> 01:46:56.853]  And I've actually gone through and archived all of them.
[01:46:57.474 --> 01:47:04.579]   And I've, you know, pieced together very damning information, evidence that shows that He's in violation of his code of conduct.
[01:47:04.619 --> 01:47:10.904]  And this was just the icing on top of the cake, Alex, because his wife then started saying, oh, Trump's going to go to prison.
[01:47:10.944 --> 01:47:19.591]  And you can see the day that he was testifying, which is, of course, the time that I interviewed George Santos, is when she started posting these really nasty tweets.
[01:47:19.611 --> 01:47:21.513]  You see her name is Dawn Marie Angoran.
[01:47:22.194 --> 01:47:23.995]  And she's made attacks on me.
[01:47:24.055 --> 01:47:27.518]  She's made attacks on Trump, the children who have had to testify.
[01:47:27.558 --> 01:47:30.741]  Isn't she now denying it's her Twitter, though it looks like it is her Twitter?
[01:47:31.533 --> 01:47:36.784]  Well, it's her Twitter, and she locked it down, of course, because I've been watching this for a while now.
[01:47:36.884 --> 01:47:37.846]  What, a Democrat is lying?
[01:47:38.026 --> 01:47:38.908]  Oh, that's hard to believe.
[01:47:40.441 --> 01:47:54.372]  So, not only did she lock her account, Alex, but I also exposed the son of the judge, because as I uncovered as well, and I showed this through photographic evidence, Arthur Engoron has allowed for his son to get preferential seating in the courtroom.
[01:47:54.452 --> 01:47:55.893]  And so, why does this matter?
[01:47:56.253 --> 01:48:03.419]  Well, his son, Ian Engoron, is a lawyer at a law firm in New York that focuses on shareholder activism for Democrats.
[01:48:03.479 --> 01:48:32.358]   And so, it's like this boutique law firm called Olshan Law Firm, and yet, The Sun is an advocate for these shareholders who are, I guess, investing in causes according to political trend lines and hiring this law firm for which Ian is also an employee of, depending on, you know, how they want to, I guess, invest their money as it relates to brands that are following ESG and it's political activism.
[01:48:32.618 --> 01:48:41.863]  And so you have to ask yourself, how does this benefit this guy if he works at a law firm focused on political activism and, you know, Democrat shareholders?
[01:48:42.263 --> 01:48:55.050]  If your father is the judge overseeing President Trump's civil fraud trial, don't you think that that's going to give you some type of financial benefit in terms of the type of clients that come to you, especially if your clientele are Democrats?
[01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:55.911]  Sure, but here's my deal.
[01:48:55.931 --> 01:48:57.992]  You're doing great work, Laura Loomer, at Loomer.com.
[01:48:58.952 --> 01:49:03.773]  Exposing this, but aren't we putting the cart before the horse or missing the forest for the trees here?
[01:49:04.454 --> 01:49:06.894]  The judge found Trump guilty.
[01:49:06.934 --> 01:49:08.175]  There's no jury.
[01:49:08.675 --> 01:49:10.555]  The thing is a sham from the beginning.
[01:49:10.895 --> 01:49:13.736]  Of course he's a virulent anti-free speech guy.
[01:49:13.756 --> 01:49:18.898]  He gave speeches to university students a few years ago saying, I ignore the law and I ignore juries.
[01:49:19.338 --> 01:49:21.458]  Well, now he's gotten rid of juries altogether.
[01:49:21.858 --> 01:49:23.139]  This is a kook.
[01:49:23.519 --> 01:49:24.899]  This is a political operative.
[01:49:24.919 --> 01:49:27.320]  This is a Marxist-Leninist monster.
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:38.749]  He is a political operative, and my investigation into his family further exposes that, because it seems like his son, it appears that his son is benefiting financially by getting this prioritized seating in the courtroom.
[01:49:39.150 --> 01:49:47.136]  And who knows, you know, how his son is exploiting the fact that his father is the judge overseeing this case, given his position in this law firm.
[01:49:47.156 --> 01:49:47.897]  And then of course the wife.
[01:49:47.917 --> 01:49:49.078]  Well yeah, that's why they're doing it.
[01:49:49.118 --> 01:49:51.920]  He'll be rewarded if the Democrats continue to have dictatorship.
[01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:54.022]  They'll make this guy a Supreme Court Justice.
[01:49:54.946 --> 01:49:58.448]  Yeah, and they'll reward his son probably with lucrative legal contracts.
[01:49:58.528 --> 01:50:01.669]  And then the wife, of course, locked her account.
[01:50:01.729 --> 01:50:05.291]  And then the son, after I exposed him, he actually deleted his LinkedIn.
[01:50:05.331 --> 01:50:08.772]  And so I see that your production team has that pulled up right there.
[01:50:08.812 --> 01:50:09.813]  You can see the video.
[01:50:10.553 --> 01:50:16.976]  The entire family has locked their accounts and is scrubbing, actively scrubbing their social media following the news of my investigation.
[01:50:17.036 --> 01:50:18.937]  It's Laura Loomer again exposing it all.
[01:50:19.297 --> 01:50:21.798]  Where is even the conservative or patriot media?
[01:50:21.878 --> 01:50:23.299]  And where's the controlled corporate media?
[01:50:23.639 --> 01:50:24.079]  Zero.
[01:50:24.399 --> 01:50:24.879]  Not there.
[01:50:24.939 --> 01:50:26.220]  That's why they want you shut down.
[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:34.763]  And also, Scott Adams released a video in which he says he thinks that my investigation could lead to a mistrial in the case of President Trump.
[01:50:34.803 --> 01:50:36.823]  So, how amazing would that be, right?
[01:50:37.264 --> 01:50:45.206]  And you see, shame on the Republican Party, because for years, Alex, they stood by and they silenced me, they silenced you, they did nothing to help, and I'm still silenced every year.
[01:50:45.226 --> 01:50:46.266]  Let's talk about this lunatic judge.
[01:50:46.306 --> 01:50:47.487]  This is a real kook.
[01:50:48.393 --> 01:51:04.141]  Yes, and the Republicans haven't done anything to address this, but Congressman Santos referred my investigative report about Arthur Engeron to the GOP House Oversight Committee, and following that, Elise Stefanik just issued a formal complaint this morning against Judge Arthur Engeron.
[01:51:04.181 --> 01:51:07.823]  And so, the guy is a complete radical leftist.
[01:51:07.863 --> 01:51:09.064]  He hates President Trump.
[01:51:09.404 --> 01:51:14.987]  I also uncovered photos from his newsletter that appears to show him with employees from the New York State court system.
[01:51:15.487 --> 01:51:25.213]  And a very heavyset black woman in the corner who is intentionally trying to avoid being caught on camera appears to be Letitia James, who is, of course, the New York Attorney General.
[01:51:25.233 --> 01:51:28.194]  Well, we have Letitia James running around saying, I get elected, I destroy Trump.
[01:51:28.595 --> 01:51:29.295]  That's my mission.
[01:51:30.255 --> 01:51:32.477]  Yeah, and Arthur Amuro is having pool parties with her.
[01:51:32.817 --> 01:51:33.817]  She tried to deny this week.
[01:51:33.838 --> 01:51:34.458]  She never said that.
[01:51:35.802 --> 01:51:39.005]  Yeah, we have it on tape, just like we have all the archives of his newsletter.
[01:51:39.045 --> 01:51:40.346]  We have his wife's Twitter account.
[01:51:40.366 --> 01:51:41.487]  And look, Alex, you know this.
[01:51:41.848 --> 01:51:43.289]  Why do people lock their accounts?
[01:51:43.709 --> 01:51:47.533]  Why would this lady care if people saw her anti-Trump posts before, right?
[01:51:47.553 --> 01:51:48.774]  There's thousands of these posts.
[01:51:48.794 --> 01:51:54.659]  She's followed by high-profile Democrats like the Krasensteins that are notorious anti-Trump operatives online.
[01:51:54.980 --> 01:52:00.445]  They're able to make $20,000 a month from Elon Musk because of the anti-Trump nonsense that they post online, okay?
[01:52:01.225 --> 01:52:03.986]  Meanwhile, I barely make anything and I'm pro-Trump, right?
[01:52:04.346 --> 01:52:15.948]  And so the reality is, Alex, is that you have this account that is clearly operating in a very unethical manner because her husband is the judge overseeing Trump's trial.
[01:52:16.348 --> 01:52:26.010]  She's followed by high-profile Democrat operatives that we know are tied to the Democrat Party and people who have been accused of receiving funding from the Democrats for their posts as well.
[01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:28.091]  And yet, she locks her account.
[01:52:28.191 --> 01:52:28.411]  Why?
[01:52:29.031 --> 01:52:31.954]  If you're so proud about your views, why are you locking your account?
[01:52:32.014 --> 01:52:35.939]  It's because they know how bad this is and that it really could lead to a mistrial.
[01:52:36.279 --> 01:52:42.286]  It is a violation of the laws for members of the family of the judge overseeing the trial to be making comments.
[01:52:42.306 --> 01:52:47.671]  Well, I mean, absolutely, and then he gags the president, and then they're all, Letitia James, his wife, all of them attacking Trump.
[01:52:48.092 --> 01:52:50.354]  That's all clear, but for listeners, they're like, okay.
[01:52:51.195 --> 01:52:52.035]  Why is this important?
[01:52:52.055 --> 01:52:55.596]  Because what they're doing with Trump, they're going to do to all of us.
[01:52:55.976 --> 01:53:02.158]  They're setting the precedent for a totally weaponized judiciary to have free reign to come after us.
[01:53:02.318 --> 01:53:08.220]  And this, again, how did they change the law where the judge decides, not a jury?
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:09.000]  This is ridiculous.
[01:53:10.205 --> 01:53:23.768]  Yeah, look, it's a complete lack of due process and the fact that they can just say, well, the judge is going to make the decision and then at the same exact time, the judge is going to allow for partisan statements to be made by his family members.
[01:53:23.788 --> 01:53:32.750]  I mean, on her Twitter account, if you pull up some of those screenshots, Alex, you can even see where she said, oh, the Fifth Amendment isn't going to save Trump and his disgusting children.
[01:53:33.250 --> 01:53:35.910]  Oh, President Trump is going to spend 2024 in the big house.
[01:53:35.950 --> 01:53:39.031]  And so they've already decided how they're going to rule on this.
[01:53:40.111 --> 01:53:43.394]  Obviously, you know, she's the lady that wears the pants in the house.
[01:53:44.275 --> 01:53:49.461]  You know, she's the facial hair of the family, you know, the beard.
[01:53:50.041 --> 01:53:52.364]  And so, you know, she's calling the shots here.
[01:53:52.384 --> 01:53:59.231]  When his wife's saying he will be convicted, nothing can save you, that's the biggest conflict of ever with her roommate, the judge.
[01:54:01.172 --> 01:54:05.754]  Absolutely, and also the fact that he's involved his children in it too.
[01:54:06.574 --> 01:54:16.538]  Following the release of my expose, his brother locked his account down, his niece and his nephew as well, and these people didn't have their accounts locked before I released the expose, so imagine this.
[01:54:16.598 --> 01:54:21.560]  No, no, no, no, you deserve credit because now you released this a few days ago, and now Congress is investigating it.
[01:54:22.523 --> 01:54:22.763]  Yes.
[01:54:23.443 --> 01:54:27.945]  And this trial's been going on for a while now and Congress didn't find the need to investigate, but now they are.
[01:54:27.965 --> 01:54:34.587]  And I am told by Congressman George Santos that it's because of my investigative report, which he referred to the House Oversight Committee.
[01:54:34.607 --> 01:54:38.308]  Shouldn't it be investigated that the judge reportedly dated Chuckie Schumer?
[01:54:39.929 --> 01:54:41.049]  Well, the clerk, right?
[01:54:41.089 --> 01:54:42.450]  He, the clerk, yeah, so.
[01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:43.990]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:47.171]  I'm not saying, no, I'm not saying he's the gay lover of Chuckie Schumer.
[01:54:47.491 --> 01:54:48.332]  I'm just joking.
[01:54:48.352 --> 01:54:48.952]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:54:50.037 --> 01:54:51.759]  No, everything needs to be investigated.
[01:54:51.819 --> 01:54:55.342]  The clerk, you know, the biased political statements we have.
[01:54:55.723 --> 01:55:00.648]  We have Chuck Schumer on video saying that Trump should be in jail and yet the clerk works for Angoran.
[01:55:01.268 --> 01:55:07.094]  There's a lot of things here that make it a very unethical, unfair trial for President Trump.
[01:55:07.194 --> 01:55:10.177]  And so I think that this is just the icing on the cake though.
[01:55:10.217 --> 01:55:16.963]   This is stuff that even Democrats can't Deny, Alex, which is why there really aren't any Democrats that are pushing back on this.
[01:55:17.043 --> 01:55:24.709]  Newsweek wrote an article and then they did it in a very deceptive manner because if you look at the Newsweek article, they said, oh, well, we actually couldn't.
[01:55:25.530 --> 01:55:28.192]  We couldn't really dispute Laura Loomer's reporting.
[01:55:28.232 --> 01:55:28.933]  It's in the article.
[01:55:29.153 --> 01:55:34.537]  They said that in the article where they said, oh, well, we can't really confirm Ms.
[01:55:34.677 --> 01:55:36.799]  Ngoron's statement that the account is not hers.
[01:55:37.139 --> 01:55:40.862]  So Newsweek, in other words, is saying we can't dispute Laura Loomer's reporting.
[01:55:40.882 --> 01:55:41.763]  By the way, let's back that up.
[01:55:41.863 --> 01:55:43.304]  That video played again for TV viewers.
[01:55:43.845 --> 01:55:48.329]  It's when they first started the trial a few weeks ago, where he's already, Trump's already guilty and there's no jury.
[01:55:48.609 --> 01:56:00.119]  When they first started this kangaroo TV Hollywood production, they pointed at him and his clerk, little George Soros, Chuckie Schumer operative, and he's smiling and celebrating.
[01:56:00.919 --> 01:56:02.300]  It's just so pathetic.
[01:56:02.321 --> 01:56:03.562]  I mean, this guy is a joke.
[01:56:03.922 --> 01:56:07.245]  But the fact that these lightweights rule over us really says we're a joke.
[01:56:08.786 --> 01:56:16.088]  Yeah, and that's what I was pointing out is just the way that he's smiling and then you have Tish James in the back of the room smiling as well.
[01:56:16.809 --> 01:56:21.290]  I've uncovered photographs that show Tish James attending pool parties with Arthur and Goron.
[01:56:21.730 --> 01:56:29.452]   These people hang out together, they celebrate the persecution of President Donald Trump and I don't see how this trial can continue.
[01:56:29.472 --> 01:56:30.132]  Because there's no consequences.
[01:56:30.333 --> 01:56:31.753]  They can commit any crime they want.
[01:56:31.793 --> 01:56:32.653]  They can do whatever they want.
[01:56:32.693 --> 01:56:34.493]  It's all just rape America.
[01:56:34.593 --> 01:56:35.414]  Screw America.
[01:56:35.754 --> 01:56:36.654]  Child traffic.
[01:56:36.794 --> 01:56:37.534]  Open the borders.
[01:56:37.894 --> 01:56:38.334]  Fentanyl.
[01:56:38.394 --> 01:56:39.215]  World War III.
[01:56:39.455 --> 01:56:40.755]  We're a bunch of crazy lawyers.
[01:56:40.795 --> 01:56:41.575]  We're invincible.
[01:56:42.315 --> 01:56:47.916]  Lawyers claim they're risk adverse and want us to not have swimming pools or slides because they're too dangerous.
[01:56:47.936 --> 01:56:54.338]  But they're the ones pushing the world to war because they're acting like they're CIA operatives or commandos and they're not even that.
[01:56:54.918 --> 01:56:56.808]  They just, they want total power!
[01:56:56.848 --> 01:56:58.717]  They're megalomaniacal crazy people!
[01:56:59.619 --> 01:57:00.159]  Yeah, they are.
[01:57:00.839 --> 01:57:03.620]  And look, I think that President Trump recognizes this as well.
[01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:08.081]  I mean, I'm not going to speak for him, but just today, I know that Don Jr.
[01:57:08.121 --> 01:57:13.221]  did a podcast and people were writing in question to the president's son's podcasts about this.
[01:57:13.441 --> 01:57:18.662]  And they even said, oh, Laura Loomer is like really doing so much to support your father.
[01:57:18.982 --> 01:57:20.183]  She should be press secretary.
[01:57:20.623 --> 01:57:26.384]  And Don Jr., I believe your team has the clip as well, even said, yeah, Laura Loomer should be press secretary.
[01:57:26.424 --> 01:57:27.824]  Maybe we should make her press secretary.
[01:57:27.864 --> 01:57:28.625]  Could you imagine that?
[01:57:28.685 --> 01:57:29.786]  Press Secretary Laura Loomer.
[01:57:29.826 --> 01:57:31.168]  I really like the sound of that, Alex.
[01:57:31.789 --> 01:57:38.216]  Well, I saw the great rally that had way more viewers than the Republican Keyboard Elf debate, as Steve Bannon calls them.
[01:57:38.897 --> 01:57:42.040]  I saw you up there and Trump and I saw Roseanne Barr.
[01:57:42.521 --> 01:57:43.422]  Very, very exciting.
[01:57:43.442 --> 01:57:44.023]  Tell us about that.
[01:57:45.236 --> 01:58:06.174]  Yeah, so I went to the Trump rally the other night and I was a special guest and I didn't even, I wasn't expecting this at all, but during President Trump's speech he actually gave me a special shout out and he said that I've been taking the nation by storm and that my reports are fabulous and he thanked me in front of everybody in Miami from the stage.
[01:58:06.214 --> 01:58:29.611]   So it was really nice, you know, obviously it feels good to be recognized for my work and it's great that You know that President Trump is now, it appears to be, really embracing his loyalists because we saw for so long there were so many gatekeepers in the first administration who worked overtime it seemed to block loyalists, right?
[01:58:29.651 --> 01:58:33.393]  And people who really honestly had President Trump's back because of lies, right?
[01:58:33.433 --> 01:58:36.055]  The lies from Media Matters and the lies from The Radical Left.
[01:58:36.135 --> 01:58:36.775]  I mean, I'm totally rewarded.
[01:58:36.795 --> 01:58:37.195]  Let me ask you this.
[01:58:37.215 --> 01:58:38.416]  And I think now they realize it.
[01:58:38.476 --> 01:58:40.736]  They see that it's all a bunch of lies, right?
[01:58:40.776 --> 01:58:42.397]  They realize that, oh, it's not true.
[01:58:42.437 --> 01:58:44.417]  And everything I said turned out to be true, too.
[01:58:44.457 --> 01:58:47.858]  I mean, look at the way Hamas is now coming across our borders.
[01:58:47.898 --> 01:58:53.419]  And we have members of Congress that are openly supporting, you know, another Holocaust for the Jewish people.
[01:58:53.519 --> 01:59:04.922]  And I mean, just like this total glorification of and propaganda machine to make it seem like the Palestinians are victims when they're just bloodthirsty to eradicate Jews and Israel.
[01:59:05.582 --> 01:59:11.846]  I mean, this is all the stuff that I was originally banned for saying years ago, and everything I've said about these jihadists is completely true.
[01:59:11.886 --> 01:59:16.709]  You were first banned for going after Ilhan Omar and the rest of them.
[01:59:17.049 --> 01:59:21.492]  Why do you think the left has embraced the most radical forms of Islam?
[01:59:21.832 --> 01:59:28.736]  And I'll criticize Israel, not all of Israel, but large parts of Israel's government are saying, send the Gazan refugees here!
[01:59:29.076 --> 01:59:29.737]  Hell no!
[01:59:31.906 --> 01:59:38.008]  Well, look, if these Palestinians are such innocent people like the Palestinian people want you to believe, how come nobody wants them?
[01:59:38.528 --> 01:59:38.668]  Right?
[01:59:38.688 --> 01:59:41.869]  I mean, how come none of the 55 Muslim countries wants these people?
[01:59:42.369 --> 01:59:43.089]  Nobody wants them!
[01:59:43.149 --> 01:59:44.750]  Nobody wants the people in Gaza.
[01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:49.712]  I mean, nobody wants to accept these people because they're terrorists and they're terrorist supporters.
[01:59:49.872 --> 01:59:52.953]  And people will say, you can't say that all Palestinians are terrorists.
[01:59:53.273 --> 02:00:04.557]   Well, when 80% of the people of Gaza openly admit that they support and voted for Hamas to represent them, That's an endorsement of the attacks on Israel, okay?
[02:00:04.637 --> 02:00:10.900]  All we need to know, even if Israel's not perfect and some people are mad at Israel and any government's got problems...
[02:00:12.083 --> 02:00:20.230]  The bottom line is the most evil George Soros left is embracing the Islamists, and this is dangerous, and this is disgusting.
[02:00:20.250 --> 02:00:21.311]  They've been doing it for years.
[02:00:21.492 --> 02:00:22.513]  They've been doing it for years.
[02:00:22.573 --> 02:00:33.002]  The guy who's in charge of our intelligence at the National Security Council, okay, I exposed this on day one of Joe Biden assuming power, Alex, is a guy by the name of Maher Bataar.
[02:00:33.042 --> 02:00:34.143]  He's a jihadist.
[02:00:34.183 --> 02:00:44.191]   He is an open Jew-hating Pro-Hamas, pro-Hezbollah Muslim, who is literally in charge of our intelligence directives at the National Security Council.
[02:00:44.211 --> 02:00:45.832]  So what's behind the scenes with the left?
[02:00:46.352 --> 02:00:48.814]  What is this sick Islamic alliance they've got going?
[02:00:48.834 --> 02:00:49.515]  What's their endgame?
[02:00:50.185 --> 02:00:51.806]  Well, they've been doing it for a while.
[02:00:51.866 --> 02:00:53.106]  It's called the Red-Green Axis.
[02:00:53.126 --> 02:01:03.371]  This is what I got banned for exposing when I went after Ilhan Omar and the fact that, you know, she's a Trojan horse who's here to basically help implement Sharia and an Islamic caliphate here in America.
[02:01:03.872 --> 02:01:11.475]  And they want to completely destroy the United States of America and erode the Constitution and replace it with Islamofascism and Marxism.
[02:01:11.895 --> 02:01:14.997]  And that's exactly what we're witnessing have happened here.
[02:01:15.397 --> 02:01:19.439]  And now you're starting to see the Islamists clash with the radical left because...
[02:01:20.060 --> 02:01:22.202]  Exactly, but that's my point.
[02:01:22.463 --> 02:01:23.905]  My enemy is my enemy, right?
[02:01:23.945 --> 02:01:28.070]  The enemy of my enemy is my friend until we also want to surpass my enemy.
[02:01:28.491 --> 02:01:48.070]   And so the Muslims are now realizing, you know, these communists in Antifa were pretty useful in the beginning of our efforts to We can't establish an Islamic caliphate, but we can't have a bunch of trannies running around, and we can't have a bunch of loud-mouthed women saying things, and we can't have a bunch of women, you know, walking around with their breasts out and their vaginas open.
[02:01:48.110 --> 02:01:53.675]  No, we need to get these women in a burqa, and we're gonna throw the homosexuals off the building, and we're gonna hang them from cranes.
[02:01:54.015 --> 02:02:01.301]  So now you're starting to even see the Muslims have clashes with some of these leftists who the left thought were their ally because, you know, they're in for a rude awakening.
[02:02:01.741 --> 02:02:07.368]  These queers for Palestine and Jews for Palestine are starting to realize what's really in the Quran.
[02:02:07.728 --> 02:02:14.456]  And I would correct you, Alex, and when you said the most radical elements of Islam, I would say there's only one version of Islam.
[02:02:14.496 --> 02:02:14.877]  There is.
[02:02:14.937 --> 02:02:16.619]  There's only one version of Islam.
[02:02:16.959 --> 02:02:22.925]   And anybody who tries to say that you can interpret Islam or that there's different varying degrees of Islam, They're lying to you.
[02:02:22.965 --> 02:02:28.828]  There's only one Quran and if you try to interpret or misinterpret or reform the Quran, you will be killed.
[02:02:28.888 --> 02:02:32.269]  You will literally be beheaded in a Muslim country as an apostate.
[02:02:32.349 --> 02:02:35.050]  And so we need to stop... Laura, let me get a word in here.
[02:02:36.241 --> 02:02:43.247]  All I'm saying is there's legitimate criticisms of Israel and any other major nations, different politics, different policies, different groups.
[02:02:43.307 --> 02:02:46.969]  A lot of Jews in Israel are fighting with each other right now, so it's not a monolith.
[02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:53.795]  But Israel and the Islamists is apples and oranges, and there are some people that are practicing Muslims.
[02:02:54.255 --> 02:02:57.837]  That actually, I think, don't want open war and don't want to expand things.
[02:02:57.897 --> 02:03:00.879]  And Saudi Arabia has backed off funding Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:03:00.939 --> 02:03:04.962]  I mean, I'm not saying that we should take the snake to our breast.
[02:03:05.562 --> 02:03:21.492]  All I'm saying is, is that I don't want to hear from any politicians, whether they're at Breitbart or Democrat, Republican, Israeli, American, whoever, that if they're too dangerous for Israel to take, we shouldn't be taking these, quote, refugees.
[02:03:22.321 --> 02:03:36.171]  I've been saying that for a while, and that's why I think that, you know, more Americans... I'm kind of shocked to see how many people on the right are, you know, trying to have these sympathetic views towards the Palestinians, because the next thing that's going to happen is, oh, we need to bring those people here!
[02:03:36.631 --> 02:03:37.632]  They're innocent!
[02:03:37.672 --> 02:03:38.973]  You know, look at what Israel did!
[02:03:39.013 --> 02:03:40.014]  They destroyed their home!
[02:03:40.054 --> 02:03:41.535]  They flattened Gaza!
[02:03:41.555 --> 02:03:42.876]  So where are they supposed to go?
[02:03:42.896 --> 02:03:53.441]   That's just... that's a manipulation tactic intended to get Americans on board with having massive refugee resettlement ahead of the 2024 election, okay?
[02:03:53.441 --> 02:03:58.961]   And you don't have to have a majority of a population in order to conquer a nation, okay?
[02:03:58.961 --> 02:04:04.240]   You don't need to have majority of America be Muslim in order for the Islamists to have a
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:06.960]   complete successful takeover of our country. This is important because in Europe on average
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:11.681]   they're 10% of the population, but they're all unified, 90% on average.
[02:04:11.861 --> 02:04:16.487]  They can be activated by Erdogan or anybody to literally go crazy and burn stuff down.
[02:04:16.547 --> 02:04:19.931]  So they're a minority in each country but together they form a majority.
[02:04:21.078 --> 02:04:22.419]  Yeah, and it's called the UMA.
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:25.923]  It's called the One World Islamic Order, okay?
[02:04:26.143 --> 02:04:33.150]  Just like you have the New World Order, you have the One World Islamic Order, the UMA, and the fact that these people are trying to implement an Islamic caliphate.
[02:04:33.170 --> 02:04:38.896]  You saw, you saw that they were literally scaling the walls of the White House, okay?
[02:04:39.056 --> 02:04:40.618]  And nobody did anything to stop them.
[02:04:41.018 --> 02:04:42.980]  Why were those people not shot on sight?
[02:04:43.621 --> 02:04:51.327]  You know, if you try to climb the wall of the White House and penetrate the perimeter, you should be shot on sight by Secret Service.
[02:04:51.667 --> 02:04:53.269]  That is not an incitement to violence.
[02:04:53.389 --> 02:04:55.971]  Well, if a Republican did it, they would shoot you.
[02:04:56.351 --> 02:05:02.996]  They would shoot the MAGA Republicans if we tried to scale the wall, so why are they not shooting the jihadists that are trying to scale the wall?
[02:05:03.036 --> 02:05:11.903]  They shot Ashley Babbitt, they assassinated that woman inside the United States Capitol, and yet they allow for a Hamas erection, all of Rashida Tlaib's jihadists.
[02:05:11.983 --> 02:05:13.564]  Laura Loomer, Loomer.com.
[02:05:13.644 --> 02:05:16.285]  Join us again soon to cover the election and more.
[02:05:16.305 --> 02:05:17.325]  Steve Bannon's coming up.
[02:05:17.625 --> 02:05:20.807]  Thank you so much, Laura Loomer, Loomer.com.
[02:05:20.827 --> 02:05:24.628]  You're exploding and doing a great job, and I'm glad their attempts to suppress you have failed.
[02:05:24.668 --> 02:05:28.170]  You are truly a success story, a phoenix, a fighter, a maverick.
[02:05:28.410 --> 02:05:29.630]  Laura Loomer, thank you so much.
[02:05:30.411 --> 02:05:31.131]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[02:05:32.118 --> 02:05:42.285]  I don't know why we have these bases all over the place in Iraq, and Iraq is now Persian controlled.
[02:05:42.766 --> 02:05:44.407]  David Ignatius told us that the other day.
[02:05:44.427 --> 02:06:00.322]   He said, Tony Blinken, being of Jewish descent, such a hero going to Baghdad to meet with the Shiite militias that We've given Iraq away after 7 trillion dollars and 6,000 dead and 50,000 combat casualties, right?
[02:06:00.703 --> 02:06:09.313]  How many Marines were there in Fallujah and Najaf and in First Fallujah on the 248th birthday commemoration of the United States Marine Corps?
[02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:11.120]  You're feeling good now?
[02:06:11.481 --> 02:06:13.922]  So make this make sense to me, Alex.
[02:06:14.202 --> 02:06:30.832]   How are we quickly getting pulled into a kinetic war at the same time our leaders who took money from the CCP, took cash money, and we have not subpoenaed him, we have not Like any information out there, you got BD, BD, BD, BD, BD, Comer, Comer.
[02:06:30.872 --> 02:06:31.433]  How about this?
[02:06:31.893 --> 02:06:34.156]  How about just cut your Fox hits in half?
[02:06:34.537 --> 02:06:35.277]  Just cut them in half.
[02:06:35.678 --> 02:06:37.921]  You can still go on, but just cut them in half, because you're on every show.
[02:06:38.401 --> 02:06:44.809]  Just cut them in half, and why don't you do your job, and Jim Jordan, you know, don't take the jacket off me breaking down on a wrestling thing.
[02:06:45.029 --> 02:06:45.930]  Just do your job.
[02:06:46.571 --> 02:06:50.095]  Then, then he wouldn't be able to go to San Francisco.
[02:06:50.135 --> 02:06:55.320]  If you'd done your job and had the frickin' information out, he wouldn't be able to go to San Francisco and kowtow.
[02:06:55.340 --> 02:06:59.204]  Because the whole nation would say, well this guy took cash money from the Chinese Communist Party.
[02:06:59.244 --> 02:06:59.925]  How can he do it?
[02:06:59.965 --> 02:07:03.528]  The reason he can do it, you don't have the information out.
[02:07:04.417 --> 02:07:05.597]  This is quite evident.
[02:07:05.677 --> 02:07:07.258]  They're laughing in your face.
[02:07:07.338 --> 02:07:08.418]  You've had it forever.
[02:07:09.179 --> 02:07:13.961]  This is Gutless McCarthy and these guys are tied up in Jordan taking money from Big Tech.
[02:07:14.281 --> 02:07:15.261]  And who's going to be out there?
[02:07:15.641 --> 02:07:20.923]  All of Jordan's donors and Big Tech will be out there at $20,000 a plate rubbing up on Xi.
[02:07:21.503 --> 02:07:21.683]  Right?
[02:07:21.723 --> 02:07:22.804]  Tell them how great things are.
[02:07:22.904 --> 02:07:23.564]  Alex Jones.
[02:07:25.645 --> 02:07:27.746]  Well, you've nailed it in the last few months.
[02:07:28.486 --> 02:07:31.227]  The United States is being walked into a three-front war.
[02:07:35.578 --> 02:08:12.209]   China and the truth is the Communist Chinese Party allied with Black Rock and allied with Klaus Schwab and all the rest of them are on Team China and our country has been sold out and you've got this Harvard lawyer class that's more obsessed with persecuting the American people and saying the number one threat is white supremacy and suppressing The shooters manifesto from Nashville and running around with all of their drag queen story times and trying to have wokeism in the US military.
[02:08:13.110 --> 02:08:14.672]  This is not by accident.
[02:08:14.692 --> 02:08:26.313]   The United States is being degraded and basically being pushed down in a slow decline program where China is the dominant force allied with other
[02:08:26.313 --> 02:08:30.673]   socialist and communist governments like Justin Trudeau's in Canada and what we see
[02:08:30.673 --> 02:08:35.802]   in the European Union. So this is a totalitarian corporate axis of evil
[02:08:35.802 --> 02:08:40.463]   headed up by BlackRock and the private central banks and the whole Obama
[02:08:40.463 --> 02:08:44.193]   economist model. When you read what the liberal Rothschilds want and what's in
[02:08:44.193 --> 02:08:48.273]   The Economist, they tell you and it's fund the Muslim Brotherhood, fund Hamas,
[02:08:48.273 --> 02:08:53.673]   fund Hezbollah, make deals with Iran in a larger plan they have to divide
[02:08:53.673 --> 02:08:58.332]   up the world and so they now admit that the Russians have defeated Zelensky
[02:08:58.332 --> 02:09:04.384]   and NATO in Ukraine and now Israel's walked into a trap that's
[02:09:04.384 --> 02:09:10.183]   energized the world basically against them. So they're losing the info war and China is
[02:09:10.183 --> 02:09:13.753]  winning the info war.
[02:09:11.899 --> 02:09:15.400]  They own, as you know, four of the six big production Hollywood houses.
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:18.761]  They fund the wokeism and the race war in America.
[02:09:18.881 --> 02:09:20.522]  They don't just fund colleges.
[02:09:20.562 --> 02:09:21.202]  Hang on, hang on.
[02:09:21.562 --> 02:09:24.743]  The Chinese Communist Party is winning the Israelis.
[02:09:24.783 --> 02:09:30.545]  And by the way, the IDF, they're going to keep grinding it out in Gaza with Hamas.
[02:09:30.645 --> 02:09:32.145]  I think we can take that as a given.
[02:09:32.365 --> 02:09:33.666]  OK, they're not going to back off.
[02:09:34.666 --> 02:09:53.461]   They got their backs up on this thing and they're gonna take care of business there, but the information war It's look at tick-tock tick-tock I think it's a billion, you know things on on the on the social justice for Palestine and nothing from these It's not even being suppressed and I mean put up there tick-tock is the way you get to these kids every one of those kids Exactly.
[02:09:53.481 --> 02:09:54.202]  I want to be 100% clear.
[02:09:54.021 --> 02:09:58.542]   York City grade schools and high schools that walked out yesterday and protested
[02:09:58.542 --> 02:10:02.461]   and showed up in the lobby with the with the adults in the New York Times.
[02:10:02.461 --> 02:10:06.461]   That's all driven by TikTok, Alex Jones, and that's a clear Chinese Communist
[02:10:06.461 --> 02:10:12.060]   Party information platform. Exactly. I want to be a hundred percent clear. I
[02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:20.101]   hate saying China and their allies at BlackRock are winning, but they are.
[02:10:18.541 --> 02:10:24.609]  The United States almost woke up the last few years and almost realized that we're being taken over.
[02:10:25.250 --> 02:10:31.158]  And China almost got defeated because of President Trump and yourself and others understood what was really going on.
[02:10:31.178 --> 02:10:35.511]   And, you know, the great American Chinese dissidents that live here in America.
[02:10:35.931 --> 02:10:37.832]  They understand how real this threat is.
[02:10:37.872 --> 02:10:39.974]  They're trying to bring that same tyranny here.
[02:10:40.014 --> 02:10:48.339]  So I'm just stating the facts to the FBI, the Justice Department, and all these lawyers, and all these establishment people, that their enemy is not the American people.
[02:10:48.379 --> 02:10:59.925]   Their enemy is the chi-coms and the globalists that are maneuvering this country into basically a second tier status and sure well will have nuclear weapons, but so does Pakistan. So does
[02:10:59.925 --> 02:11:05.314]   that make them a first tier nation? No, it doesn't. America and our cities and our culture and our
[02:11:05.314 --> 02:11:07.765]  currency, all of it is degrading.
[02:11:07.765 --> 02:11:13.364]   We are in a serious crisis and we have a very corrupt establishment that will make all the
[02:11:13.364 --> 02:11:18.885]   deals with any totalitarian that they can find, but will not do anything to shore up even their
[02:11:18.885 --> 02:11:23.445]   own power base because they have a chip on their shoulder against the Midwest and against
[02:11:23.445 --> 02:11:26.965]  conservatives and against veterans.
[02:11:25.275 --> 02:11:31.840]  And they instinctively still believe their own brainwashing that they finance the universities that America is the target.
[02:11:31.860 --> 02:11:36.644]  So they're blowing their own feet off in an attempt to secure their power base here.
[02:11:37.124 --> 02:11:40.747]  And that creates a vacuum where all these other groups get a chance to come in.
[02:11:40.767 --> 02:11:42.969]  And I agree, Israel is going to win.
[02:11:46.503 --> 02:11:52.847]  War wiping out most of the Hamas and Hezbollah backed people that are there.
[02:11:52.947 --> 02:12:01.112]  But in the information war, notice the corporate media will act like they're pro-Israel just as a icing.
[02:12:01.432 --> 02:12:10.638]  But when you dig into the heart of it, all the big corporations, Hollywood, the left, they're lining up against Israel and against America.
[02:12:10.678 --> 02:12:14.160]  There is a giant double cross here that sends chills up my spine.
[02:12:16.215 --> 02:12:21.437]  No, this is where, in Thessaloniki's Peloponnesian War, this is where the term Pyrrhic Victory came from.
[02:12:21.937 --> 02:12:25.658]  It was in Syracuse, which was like the Vietnam of their day.
[02:12:25.718 --> 02:12:29.779]  They won that conflict, that part of the overall global war they were fighting.
[02:12:31.099 --> 02:12:32.260]  But it was a Pyrrhic Victory.
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:38.562]  And winning that, they had so many casualties and so much diversion that they lost the overall war.
[02:12:39.002 --> 02:12:40.122]  That's why they call it a Pyrrhic Victory.
[02:12:40.142 --> 02:12:40.662]  And World War I!
[02:12:43.897 --> 02:12:49.681]  The British Empire started World War I, so they were kind of the bad guys in World War I in my view.
[02:12:50.281 --> 02:13:00.468]  World War II, obviously Hitler was the bad guy, and the Kaisers weren't perfect, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but the Germans were dominating in industry and science, and the British newspapers had thousands of headlines.
[02:13:03.310 --> 02:13:10.310]   So they basically assassinated the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, had that domino effect, but then it was World War I that
[02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:12.310]  ended up killing most of the British Empire's power.
[02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:18.890]   That was a Pyrrhic victory, and that's a perfect analogy that you bring up with the original Pyrrhic victory and
[02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:21.310]  then others we've seen over the years.
[02:13:21.584 --> 02:13:23.825]  This is an absolute Pyrrhic victory.
[02:13:24.045 --> 02:13:40.012]  And so the question is, how do we get the leadership that's in our government like Jim Jordan and like others that should be fighting this and should be talking about it to stop sucking at the you-know-what, the tit of big tech that is totally in bed with Xi Jinping.
[02:13:40.412 --> 02:13:42.153]  These people need to be arrested.
[02:13:42.433 --> 02:13:44.013]  I mean, go back six years ago.
[02:13:44.694 --> 02:13:45.534]  Headline in Reuters.
[02:13:46.505 --> 02:13:57.292]  Apple gives the code keys to all Apple devices in the world to China, and they had Tim Cook in the article going, well, when you do business in China, that's what you do.
[02:13:57.612 --> 02:14:00.474]  So remember, Google wouldn't give AI to the U.S.
[02:14:00.534 --> 02:14:04.736]  military in the Pentagon, but they would do an AI project with Xi Jinping.
[02:14:04.997 --> 02:14:08.439]  These people are in bed with totalitarians.
[02:14:09.299 --> 02:14:09.920]  They love it.
[02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:16.445]   You have these different sports team owners that say, I don't care if there's 3 million Uyghurs in slave camps in China.
[02:14:16.785 --> 02:14:19.007]  These people, they're idiots.
[02:14:19.227 --> 02:14:20.208]  They're Neville Chamberlains.
[02:14:20.468 --> 02:14:37.102]  They think just because the Chinese communists buy them off and give them sex operatives and kiss their asses that they're dealing with a 6,000-year-old culture that's playing a long game and the dumbass liberal Harvard lawyers think that they're organizing all this and they're really in charge.
[02:14:37.302 --> 02:14:39.764]  But look around you, you dumbass New World Order people.
[02:14:39.964 --> 02:14:41.846]  You're destroying your own power.
[02:14:41.686 --> 02:14:46.726]   power base and then trying to destroy the American people because you see us contending
[02:14:46.726 --> 02:14:51.285]   for the power over Washington when you're running the whole country on the ground and
[02:14:51.285 --> 02:14:53.406]  soon it won't be worth anything.
[02:14:53.406 --> 02:14:55.285]  They've got to be stopped.
[02:14:55.285 --> 02:14:57.006]  They're incompetent idiots.
[02:14:57.006 --> 02:15:01.286]  I got to be stopped in all the swing states.
[02:15:01.336 --> 02:15:02.477]  I'll get to that in a little while.
[02:15:02.537 --> 02:15:24.577]   Talking about stop, yesterday I played the clips on, you know, today's the 248th anniversary commemoration of the birth of the legendary Marine Corps, United States Marines, the junior naval service, I might add, and tomorrow's Veterans Day and also Armistice Day in England about the uh... the armistice that uh... led to the end of of world
[02:15:24.577 --> 02:15:27.768]   war one we had a sergeant we had a twelve i think fifteen-year
[02:15:27.768 --> 02:15:31.208]   veteran national guard non-commissioned officer sergeant
[02:15:31.208 --> 02:15:36.288]   uh... hunted like a dog abide this massive tactical force of the f_b_i_
[02:15:36.288 --> 02:15:39.106]   uh... give me up to date on that the debate is everything going on here we
[02:15:39.106 --> 02:15:41.847]   get eight to ten million illegal alien invaders in the country
[02:15:41.963 --> 02:15:44.224]  You know you've got sleeper cells all over the place.
[02:15:44.324 --> 02:15:47.306]  Ray goes to Congress and says, hey, I'm not really following these guys, right?
[02:15:47.646 --> 02:15:51.808]  I'm focused on violent extremists and hunting down a guy.
[02:15:51.828 --> 02:15:54.250]  And you see they've got the helicopters.
[02:15:54.570 --> 02:15:59.353]  And the reason they're doing it is to send a message to the Saudi and send a message to the MAGA, to the deplorables.
[02:15:59.793 --> 02:16:01.574]  We're going to hunt you like a dog one day, right?
[02:16:01.614 --> 02:16:02.394]  Don't get out of line.
[02:16:02.434 --> 02:16:05.876]  So can you give us an update on all this and what's happening to the J6 guys?
[02:16:08.058 --> 02:16:08.863]  Well, absolutely.
[02:16:08.884 --> 02:16:10.574]  I mean, let's go back to a few years ago.
[02:16:11.425 --> 02:16:21.612]  When they're in Virginia, they're trying to teach critical race theory and trying to force transgender on them, and transgenders are raping little girls in the bathrooms, and they're covering it up.
[02:16:21.672 --> 02:16:27.456]  We learned the Justice Department is telling the school boards and groups, go file criminal complaints.
[02:16:27.496 --> 02:16:31.518]  We can send an armed FBI in to intimidate people at school boards.
[02:16:32.039 --> 02:16:33.200]  That's what they're focused on.
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:40.424]  Not the fentanyl, not the Hezbollah Hamas sleeper cells, not the probably more than 10 million that have come in the last two and a half years.
[02:16:41.104 --> 02:16:46.305]   to the nation, and then you've got tens of thousands of federal agents that have been
[02:16:46.305 --> 02:16:52.225]   working on arresting thousands and prosecuting thousands of people, most of them were totally
[02:16:52.225 --> 02:16:56.504]   peaceful, were waived in by police at the Capitol on January 6th.
[02:16:56.504 --> 02:17:00.344]   And so if you tune into MSNBC or CNN, you've seen the clips, we played them.
[02:17:00.318 --> 02:17:10.904]  I mean, they literally say, and they'll have former CIA guys on and defense intelligence guys on who are quote liberals, who are traitors against the country going, our main threat's no longer Islam and it's no longer even China.
[02:17:11.264 --> 02:17:13.525]  The main threat is the domestic MAGA group.
[02:17:14.105 --> 02:17:18.889]  And we need to shift the main focus of Homeland Security on them and outlaw their party and arrest them.
[02:17:19.289 --> 02:17:25.614]  That is a talking point of these totalitarians that want a one-party state, saying the main focus of the U.S.
[02:17:25.734 --> 02:17:27.955]  government is white Christian conservatives.
[02:17:28.015 --> 02:17:32.519]  And I'll give you a Joe Biggs update, got some good news there, thanks to pressure yourself and others.
[02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:36.602]  Alex, Alex, Alex, hang on for a second.
[02:17:36.642 --> 02:17:37.963]  I want to wait for the Joe Biggs.
[02:17:37.983 --> 02:17:39.204]  I'm gonna take a short commercial break.
[02:17:39.724 --> 02:17:43.547]  Bring back the Alex Jones who's on fire today.
[02:17:44.408 --> 02:17:46.149]  Alex Jones at his best, right?
[02:17:46.210 --> 02:17:46.810]  Throwing down.
[02:17:48.591 --> 02:17:50.892]  8 to 10 million person invasion.
[02:17:51.112 --> 02:17:52.192]  That's a big front in this war.
[02:17:52.212 --> 02:17:55.794]  Remember, the pandemic was a bioweapon.
[02:17:56.434 --> 02:17:57.794]  Fentanyl is a chemical weapon.
[02:17:58.374 --> 02:18:00.555]  This is just the second opium war in reverse.
[02:18:00.575 --> 02:18:06.437]  We had the story last night from Maine of CCP folks buying the property and getting into the drug business.
[02:18:07.277 --> 02:18:11.419]  This is a multi-front war on your doorstep in the war room.
[02:18:11.459 --> 02:18:12.099]  Back in a moment.
[02:18:14.022 --> 02:18:25.669]  Okay, I want to make sure everybody, if you go on the live chat on Telegram or with the Midnight Rider, Grace and Mo, and if we can get to the Midnight Rider, I want everybody, this app is totally free.
[02:18:26.169 --> 02:18:27.530]  It's a force multiplier for you.
[02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:39.437]   We're going to have some very tough, tough days ahead, and hey, There are going to be occasions we're not going to, we're going to have to get cross-references to folks who are obviously very dear to this audience and dear to us.
[02:18:40.277 --> 02:18:41.878]  But remember, we've got to anchor the right here.
[02:18:42.378 --> 02:18:44.500]  And right now, it's just no way.
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:46.461]  You heard, and Stern's a good man.
[02:18:46.501 --> 02:18:49.823]  He's been on here, he's done the numbers, and he's trying to make the case, hey, you need more time.
[02:18:50.583 --> 02:18:51.244]  Time's up, baby.
[02:18:51.264 --> 02:18:54.366]  We appreciate you, respect you, respect Johnson.
[02:18:54.406 --> 02:18:54.826]  Time's up.
[02:18:55.626 --> 02:18:56.147]  Time is up.
[02:18:57.502 --> 02:18:57.823]  Nothing.
[02:18:58.023 --> 02:19:04.509]  Let it, let it, let it, let Biden come back from, let him come back from rubbing up on Xi, right?
[02:19:04.569 --> 02:19:07.091]  Because this, this epitomizes all the failures.
[02:19:08.552 --> 02:19:19.242]  He would never, ever in a million years, it is, it is an obscenity that he is, he can go and get a free pass to even meet with Xi, having taken the money.
[02:19:20.768 --> 02:19:26.532]  Because McCarthy's guy so tied to big tech suppressed Jordan's ability and Comer's ability to do it.
[02:19:26.732 --> 02:19:27.253]  Well, guess what?
[02:19:27.453 --> 02:19:27.913]  He's gone.
[02:19:27.973 --> 02:19:39.882]  We should have done it immediately and should have made it should be every night and just the information war should be out there, out there, out there, so that it would be politically impossible for Joe Biden even consider getting on the plane.
[02:19:41.383 --> 02:19:42.844]  That meeting in San Francisco.
[02:19:44.013 --> 02:19:47.635]  Is a testament to the fecklessness of the Republican Party.
[02:19:48.175 --> 02:19:56.319]  They're just a bunch of, I notice here, they're just a bunch of hapless, gormless, they're all about risk mitigation.
[02:19:57.160 --> 02:20:04.844]  And risk mitigation is smart, you've got to think that through, but they never want to kind of take the punch, they never want to, they don't have the courage to go, we have to go there.
[02:20:05.684 --> 02:20:06.444]  We have to go there.
[02:20:06.644 --> 02:20:10.626]  This audience, how many long odds have we fought on this show in the last couple years?
[02:20:10.646 --> 02:20:11.287]  How many long odds?
[02:20:12.662 --> 02:20:13.043]  In one.
[02:20:14.044 --> 02:20:14.384]  How many?
[02:20:15.466 --> 02:20:15.846]  Think about it.
[02:20:15.866 --> 02:20:16.507]  You've got to take that.
[02:20:17.168 --> 02:20:18.429]  Were some of these victories perfect?
[02:20:18.489 --> 02:20:18.990]  No, they weren't.
[02:20:19.751 --> 02:20:20.272]  No, they weren't.
[02:20:20.672 --> 02:20:21.713]  Study the history of warfare.
[02:20:22.374 --> 02:20:25.518]  You think everything that led up to the victory in World War II were all perfect victories?
[02:20:25.959 --> 02:20:26.560]  No, they were not.
[02:20:26.660 --> 02:20:28.182]  And there were tons of defeats in there.
[02:20:28.762 --> 02:20:29.563]  And in the Civil War.
[02:20:29.704 --> 02:20:30.525]  And in the Revolution.
[02:20:33.027 --> 02:20:35.969]  Alex Jones, by the way, so get the app and download it.
[02:20:36.609 --> 02:20:39.110]  And get to Grace, and Grace is going to give a seminar.
[02:20:39.130 --> 02:20:44.253]  We're going to do some sort of breakout at the Turning Point AmFest, which you've got to go to, 16th and 19th in Phoenix.
[02:20:44.313 --> 02:20:44.914]  You've got to go to that.
[02:20:45.594 --> 02:20:46.314]  We're going to be there.
[02:20:46.334 --> 02:20:47.575]  The whole team's coming.
[02:20:47.595 --> 02:20:49.836]  We're going to try to have breakout sessions, get to know you.
[02:20:50.777 --> 02:20:56.540]  I'll get it up this afternoon, or maybe with time remaining, if I can get the ad and put it, not the ad, but the poster.
[02:20:57.689 --> 02:21:03.274]  Grace is going to do a breakout session about how to actually use it to the ultimate because it's a very powerful tool.
[02:21:04.195 --> 02:21:10.520]  Alex, we do have some good news about fighters and about people that we had to have their back.
[02:21:10.600 --> 02:21:15.584]  Walk us through what's happened over the last day or two that you've been working on relentlessly.
[02:21:17.466 --> 02:21:25.713]  Well, we all know they tortured many of the J6 defendants, even people that just walked into the Capitol and never even touched anybody or even yelled.
[02:21:26.850 --> 02:21:33.873]  And then we saw what happened to Oath Keepers totally being railroaded by the kangaroo courts there in DC.
[02:21:34.633 --> 02:21:37.694]  And then we saw what happened to the Proud Boys, people like Joe Biggs.
[02:21:38.675 --> 02:21:40.796]  They called it terrorism for shaking offense.
[02:21:41.336 --> 02:21:44.217]  That's the terrorism basically designation conviction.
[02:21:45.137 --> 02:21:51.589]   And so after his conviction, Joe Biggs, particularly, you know, Army veteran, Purple Heart winner, you name it, really a war hero.
[02:21:51.609 --> 02:21:53.550]  They called it terrorism for shaking offense.
[02:21:54.091 --> 02:21:56.993]  That's the terrorism basically designation conviction.
[02:21:57.893 --> 02:22:08.921]  And so after his conviction, Joe Biggs, particularly, you know, Army veteran, Purple Heart winner, you name it, really a war hero, and former InfoWars reporter years ago, he disappeared.
[02:22:10.101 --> 02:22:20.686]   And maybe once every three, four weeks, he'd be able to talk to his family members, But he hadn't been able to talk to his lawyer, who's also my lawyer, Norm Pattis, who's a great constitutional lawyer.
[02:22:21.546 --> 02:22:32.472]  And so then he finally got a call out last week, and people got a hold of me, who actually talked to him, and then I later confirmed that this did happen, and now his lawyer's been able to talk to him.
[02:22:32.512 --> 02:22:45.856]   I talked to Norm this morning that after we all talked about this, And after they talked about it in Congress some, they also talked about Owen Schroer, one of my reporters, who's in solitary confinement for just being at the Capitol.
[02:22:46.216 --> 02:22:52.801]  And the judge said in the sentencing order, they gave three examples, the feds tattled and said, here's three times this summer.
[02:22:53.601 --> 02:22:56.723]  And they gave a transcript where Owen Schroer still says the election was stolen.
[02:22:57.264 --> 02:23:05.309]  So they're saying, we're giving you jail time for your speech, just flagrantly, but he didn't get 20 something years like Joe Biggs.
[02:23:05.389 --> 02:23:07.551]  So Joe disappears into this labyrinth.
[02:23:08.311 --> 02:23:22.118]  They move him to more than 15 different facilities, that's called dieseling, where they drive you for up to 20 hours a day in box handcuffs that the manufacturer says you should only put on somebody for three hours.
[02:23:22.619 --> 02:23:30.082]  They use that when they're transporting people that are in supermax prisons or are psychotic mass murderers or Al Qaeda.
[02:23:30.723 --> 02:23:39.324]   And so it can, you know, I mean, it can They tortured him for the last month or so with these box handcuffs.
[02:23:39.583 --> 02:23:45.663]   They would go put him and other J6 convicts now in buses and say we're going to move them
[02:23:45.663 --> 02:23:52.063]   and just park them there out in the parking lot all day long. They would take their clothing away,
[02:23:52.063 --> 02:23:56.142]   throw them in their underwear into rooms together up to 15 at a time.
[02:23:56.321 --> 02:23:57.081]  They would feed them.
[02:23:57.502 --> 02:24:01.324]  In some cases, every two days, they'd get one piece of pizza.
[02:24:01.984 --> 02:24:04.005]  They'd get maybe a cup of water a day.
[02:24:05.386 --> 02:24:10.649]  Literally not giving them any medicines, any prescriptions they had, in a black hole.
[02:24:11.430 --> 02:24:23.534]   So when we learned about this, and I called you, and called a few other people, and the story got out, And I had his lawyer on yesterday and some other folks on my show at about 11 30 central by five o'clock in the afternoon.
[02:24:23.994 --> 02:24:25.255]  And this comes directly from Biggs.
[02:24:26.636 --> 02:24:27.817]  They come and get him.
[02:24:27.837 --> 02:24:36.984]  They put him in a car and they drive him from Georgia to Talladega Federal Prison, which is his final destination, where he'll reportedly be for decades.
[02:24:38.362 --> 02:24:43.725]  And they gave him food and gave him a bed and a jail cell.
[02:24:43.865 --> 02:24:45.706]  And then they didn't put the box handcuffs on him.
[02:24:46.006 --> 02:24:48.327]  They put regular handcuffs on him.
[02:24:49.088 --> 02:24:51.869]  And let's just say this.
[02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:57.312]  Anytime we talk about anybody getting decent treatment, Owen Schroeder said, hey, I'm getting treated well.
[02:24:57.692 --> 02:24:58.752]  Thanks to all the listeners.
[02:24:58.972 --> 02:25:02.034]  He called out to a family member who recorded it, put it on Twitter.
[02:25:02.334 --> 02:25:06.296]  They put him in solitary confinement for the rest of his stay in Louisiana.
[02:25:06.656 --> 02:25:08.016]  We're just saying, hey, I'm great.
[02:25:08.116 --> 02:25:08.737]  Love everybody.
[02:25:08.797 --> 02:25:09.457]  Love Jesus.
[02:25:09.797 --> 02:25:10.677]  Really positive.
[02:25:10.717 --> 02:25:12.218]  Didn't criticize even the government.
[02:25:12.678 --> 02:25:15.098]  They said, well, you're not allowed to call out and have it be on the air.
[02:25:15.398 --> 02:25:16.179]  Well, we checked the law.
[02:25:16.219 --> 02:25:16.979]  That's not even the case.
[02:25:17.019 --> 02:25:18.319]  He wasn't on there with a call either.
[02:25:18.639 --> 02:25:22.360]  He was just calling out and then a family member recorded it and put his message out to the public.
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:24.421]  So it's pure persecution.
[02:25:24.481 --> 02:25:39.235]   But since We talked about it, and you talked about it, and since Congress is aware of it, and since Congressman Biggs, no relation, is the head of the committee that's over the Bureau of Prisons, reportedly put calls in about an hour after my show, and I was told you talked about it, I believe.
[02:25:39.755 --> 02:25:48.970]   After this all came out, they basically instantly Came and stopped the torture that's been going on ever since he was convicted a month and a half, two months ago.
[02:25:49.451 --> 02:25:52.092]  So this is what they want to do to everybody.
[02:25:52.692 --> 02:26:00.717]  This is what they did, of course, to the first big Trump guy that they were able to convict, who was, you know, the head of the Trump campaign.
[02:26:01.537 --> 02:26:02.338]  They did that to him.
[02:26:02.378 --> 02:26:05.439]  They tortured the hell out of him until he was in a wheelchair.
[02:26:06.180 --> 02:26:11.002]  And so this is real totalitarian North Korea style stuff.
[02:26:11.102 --> 02:26:12.083]  And they're scaling it up.
[02:26:12.864 --> 02:26:16.248]  And oh, this is the key that the lawyer learned from the prison.
[02:26:17.129 --> 02:26:18.691]  He was able to even talk to the warden.
[02:26:19.813 --> 02:26:26.722]  They said, look, we're giving a terrorism designation with these people and then this is how they're treated, basically.
[02:26:27.603 --> 02:26:28.064]  And so...
[02:26:29.019 --> 02:26:33.722]  But, but, I mean, I've read and I know Jack Posobiec, I think worked at Guantanamo and I've seen documentaries about it.
[02:26:34.102 --> 02:26:44.468]  They get special diets, they get, I mean, they're basically pampered at Guantanamo, unless they're taken to the smaller CIA bases there and, quote, MK altered or tortured.
[02:26:44.808 --> 02:26:48.070]  But, but Al Qaeda and Taliban are treated better than U.S.
[02:26:48.090 --> 02:26:51.332]   veterans who shook a fence Here in America.
[02:26:51.392 --> 02:26:54.095]  So I want to thank the viewers and listeners of The War Room.
[02:26:54.115 --> 02:27:03.404]  I want to thank everybody for really caring about the J6ers because they are setting the precedent for the rest of us and we've got to stand together, hang together, or hang separate.
[02:27:04.187 --> 02:27:21.882]  Well, everybody that's doing that, and every operative that's doing that, every employee that's doing that, understand, high noon on the 20th of January, in the year of the Lord 2025, there's a new sheriff in town, and everyone will be held accountable for their actions, and we're not going to accept, I was just taking orders.
[02:27:22.302 --> 02:27:23.203]  It will not be good enough.
[02:27:23.323 --> 02:27:26.266]  Alex, how do people get to your show that they're trying to ban?
[02:27:26.286 --> 02:27:27.467]  How do they get to your social media?
[02:27:27.507 --> 02:27:28.528]  How do they get to InfoWars?
[02:27:29.514 --> 02:27:31.275]  Well, thank you, Steve.
[02:27:31.415 --> 02:27:36.317]  I'm a fighter, and I don't like to have to give people bad news, but it's also my job to do it.
[02:27:37.077 --> 02:27:40.238]  I am personally $2 million upside down.
[02:27:41.118 --> 02:27:42.979]  I've got a small lake house I'm selling.
[02:27:43.339 --> 02:27:44.000]  It's up for sale.
[02:27:44.040 --> 02:27:47.641]  That won't even... After that sells, I'll be $2 million in the hole, and I'm not complaining.
[02:27:48.607 --> 02:27:55.893]  The bankruptcy lawyers coming after me in the Democratic Party, literally the Democrat Party law firms, have spent $25 million in the last year trying to shut me down.
[02:27:56.233 --> 02:27:59.556]  They spent over $30 million before that in the last five years in all their lawfare.
[02:27:59.916 --> 02:28:00.577]  They haven't done it.
[02:28:00.657 --> 02:28:02.919]  Free speech systems is operating, staying on air.
[02:28:03.359 --> 02:28:05.221]  InfoWars has enough money to barely operate.
[02:28:05.681 --> 02:28:07.262]  I personally am upside down.
[02:28:07.702 --> 02:28:12.683]  I would ask your listeners to keep me in the fight to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get a signed copy.
[02:28:12.743 --> 02:28:13.463]  It's a fundraiser.
[02:28:13.623 --> 02:28:18.745]  That's why it's got markup on it of the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[02:28:19.025 --> 02:28:22.906]  It breaks down the Great Reset, how to stop them versus number one on Amazon.
[02:28:23.106 --> 02:28:24.807]   But I I need support.
[02:28:25.247 --> 02:28:26.028]  I'll never give up.
[02:28:26.108 --> 02:28:26.928]  I'll never give in.
[02:28:27.689 --> 02:28:33.353]  But I could give out because the federal court has ordered me to pay half the legal fees of free speech systems.
[02:28:33.733 --> 02:28:39.878]  And so I got an $8 million donation from some anonymous person two years ago.
[02:28:41.379 --> 02:28:54.052]  98% of it, and they didn't believe me, so they did federal audits, IRS, the federal judge sent in three auditing firms, made me pay a half million dollars in the last year and a half of bankruptcy to prove I told the total truth.
[02:28:54.512 --> 02:28:56.074]  A, I'm not a liar, I'm a straight shooter.
[02:28:56.734 --> 02:28:59.597]  And B, they'll put me in prison if I dot an I wrong.
[02:28:59.997 --> 02:29:09.565]  So I put everything I've got, I'm selling my car, and I guess I'm gonna, I think my uncle's gonna give me one of his old cars.
[02:29:09.605 --> 02:29:09.785]  Great.
[02:29:09.985 --> 02:29:11.467]  I love a 15-year-old F-150.
[02:29:11.967 --> 02:29:12.688]  I'm not about money.
[02:29:12.968 --> 02:29:14.749]  It's a badge of honor to be in this fight.
[02:29:15.090 --> 02:29:21.149]   But folks, I need support, I need prayer, 'cause they pushed me financially to the wall.
[02:29:21.149 --> 02:29:24.889]   Please go to infowarestore.com and get a copy of "The Great Reset,"
[02:29:24.889 --> 02:29:26.769]  my last book, and "The Great Awakening."
[02:29:26.769 --> 02:29:28.569]  The last one went to number one.
[02:29:28.569 --> 02:29:33.949]   This book's doing okay, but it was our ace in the hole to hopefully be able to keep operating.
[02:29:33.949 --> 02:29:36.609]  We're about to actually end the bankruptcy and win it.
[02:29:36.609 --> 02:29:39.010]   A lot of things have happened I can't get to behind the scenes,
[02:29:39.010 --> 02:29:40.808]  but we finally run 'em up against the wall.
[02:29:40.808 --> 02:29:47.129]   But like any war, or any heavyweight boxing match, it's so close, folks, so I hate to come on here and beg,
[02:29:47.129 --> 02:29:49.849]   but I think I've delivered the fight, so I really need support,
[02:29:49.849 --> 02:29:52.090]  and I'm at infowarestore.com/show.
[02:29:52.090 --> 02:29:56.790]  "The Great Awakening," forward by Stephen K. Bannon.
[02:29:56.790 --> 02:30:00.729]   Alex, we'll have you back on to go through more details of that.
[02:30:00.729 --> 02:30:02.529]  Thank you very much, Godspeed.
[02:30:02.529 --> 02:30:04.370]  This audience will have you back.
[02:30:04.370 --> 02:30:05.529]  "The Great Awakening."
[02:30:05.529 --> 02:30:09.430]  (dramatic music)
[02:30:10.430 --> 02:30:13.190]  (dramatic music)
[02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:15.949]  (dramatic music)
[02:30:15.949 --> 02:30:18.530]  (upbeat music)
[02:30:18.530 --> 02:30:21.449]  (electronic music)
[02:30:20.359 --> 02:30:21.760]  Your products have changed my life.
[02:30:22.100 --> 02:30:24.201]  Your brain force and all that makes me better.
[02:30:24.261 --> 02:30:25.401]  They make me more focused.
[02:30:25.461 --> 02:30:26.541]  They make me feel better.
[02:30:26.561 --> 02:30:30.863]  A lot of lingering effects from when I was getting sober have now relieved me.
[02:30:31.003 --> 02:30:32.744]  My girlfriend goes to the gym and goes hard.
[02:30:32.764 --> 02:30:34.244]  She's on the turmeric and the same stuff.
[02:30:34.705 --> 02:30:36.225]  These products will change your life.
[02:30:36.705 --> 02:30:41.507]  They fund one of the greatest things out there right now for us as free Americans.
[02:30:41.687 --> 02:30:43.048]  Please do these people a favor.
[02:30:43.568 --> 02:30:50.296]  Go to their store, support them, do what you need to do, because if we lose InfoWars, we lose a lot more than what people are willing to believe.
[02:30:50.656 --> 02:31:02.169]  If you want to really get in shape for this thing about to come, get the HGH and get that testosterone boost, man, get in the gym, because I'm in the best shape of my life because of your product, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
[02:31:02.609 --> 02:31:04.791]  Hi everybody, Joel Gilbert from Los Angeles.
[02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:08.710]   tyranny the world has ever seen and that's our American flag and with that I appreciate
[02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:12.389]   loving 4 Wars. I'll listen to you the day I die or you go on bare but I'm gonna do my part to
[02:31:12.389 --> 02:31:14.229]  make sure you don't have a great day.
[02:31:14.229 --> 02:31:20.389]  [Music]
[02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:25.190]   Hi everybody, Joel Gilbert from Los Angeles. I'm here to talk for the next hour about my
[02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:31.270]   new film and book which you can get in the Info Wars store, Michelle Obama 2024,
[02:31:31.270 --> 02:31:33.510]  a real-life story and plan for power.
[02:31:33.574 --> 02:31:38.259]  Please go to the InfoWars store and get the book and the film.
[02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:57.052]   We're going to have Roger Stone come on in a little while here and talk about what's going on in politics because You probably saw this past week, Obama sycophant and ally David Axelrod came out with very serious tweets and all over CNN talking about how Joe Biden needs to make a decision.
[02:31:57.613 --> 02:31:59.053]  They're trying to kind of push him out.
[02:31:59.734 --> 02:32:01.634]  Axelrod is delivering the Obama message.
[02:32:02.235 --> 02:32:04.636]  You probably also heard Vivek Ramaswamy.
[02:32:05.676 --> 02:32:13.944]  In his closing statement at the GOP debate, he said the obvious that Joe Biden is not running and we need to know who it's going to be, if it's going to be Michelle Obama.
[02:32:13.964 --> 02:32:14.785]  He actually said it.
[02:32:15.686 --> 02:32:24.535]  So we're going to talk about the politics of this because Biden's poll numbers are upside down and no one wants him.
[02:32:24.575 --> 02:32:25.756]  The Democrats don't want him.
[02:32:26.276 --> 02:32:27.157]  The down ballot.
[02:32:29.784 --> 02:32:34.227]  Candidates in the Democrat party from state senators to congressmen, they don't want them.
[02:32:34.267 --> 02:32:36.289]  Governors, they're afraid it'll bring down the ticket.
[02:32:36.929 --> 02:32:39.931]  So the consensus is Joe Biden is on his way out.
[02:32:40.592 --> 02:32:41.433]  There are two theories.
[02:32:41.813 --> 02:32:48.718]  My predominant theory is that December 23rd, we have a deadline for getting on all the primary ballots.
[02:32:48.738 --> 02:32:49.899]  You have to get your signatures in.
[02:32:50.589 --> 02:32:55.192]  And I think Michelle will probably announce her president this month and have plenty of time to get her signatures in.
[02:32:55.732 --> 02:33:04.477]  We've heard Ted Cruz, the Senator, floating an idea for the last couple of months that Joe Biden would go through the primary process and then be forced out.
[02:33:05.117 --> 02:33:06.838]  And that would free up his delegates.
[02:33:06.878 --> 02:33:19.666]  He could be forced out for any number of excuses like health or being impeached or just the whole country deteriorating so badly that he cannot run again, similar to what LBJ dropped out after a primary.
[02:33:20.382 --> 02:33:28.086]  So, in my book and film, Michelle Obama 2024, I show her real life story, because that's important to know.
[02:33:28.146 --> 02:33:32.468]  Michelle has just as fabricated a background as her husband, Barack.
[02:33:33.589 --> 02:33:40.432]  Michelle has been pushing a life story for years, saying that she's from the south side of Chicago.
[02:33:41.013 --> 02:33:41.893]  Turns out she's not.
[02:33:41.933 --> 02:33:45.235]  She's from South Shore, which is an exclusive community on Lake Michigan.
[02:33:47.362 --> 02:33:56.567]  So much about her story where she makes up all these racial stories about how she's suffered from discrimination, was held back in life because of her skin color.
[02:33:57.087 --> 02:33:58.368]  It's all complete nonsense.
[02:33:58.428 --> 02:33:59.709]  Michelle was a privileged kid.
[02:34:00.229 --> 02:34:03.971]  Her father was a politician, was a precinct captain in Chicago.
[02:34:04.571 --> 02:34:11.515]  So let's take a look at the movie trailer for Michelle Obama, 2024, and then we'll get back into it and bring on Roger Stone.
[02:34:11.354 --> 02:34:12.635]  on. Let's see the movie trailer.
[02:34:12.635 --> 02:34:20.953]  Okay, we're still looking for that.
[02:34:20.863 --> 02:34:21.305]  Here we go.
[02:34:21.445 --> 02:34:23.450]  They could run Michelle Obama.
[02:34:23.811 --> 02:34:26.437]  And if they do... Welcome Michelle Obama!
[02:34:28.854 --> 02:34:31.915]  Michelle Obama is the most popular woman in America.
[02:34:32.695 --> 02:34:34.175]  You know I hate politics.
[02:34:34.695 --> 02:34:36.356]  You can forget about the disclaimer.
[02:34:37.076 --> 02:34:40.957]  I'm convinced that Michelle Obama is running for president in 2024.
[02:34:41.017 --> 02:34:46.978]  Systemic racism, pepper spray and rubber bullets on peaceful protesters.
[02:34:47.138 --> 02:34:50.979]  She's following the exact same formula that Barack did to become president.
[02:34:51.339 --> 02:34:54.620]  Michelle was the keynote speaker at the 2020 Democrat Convention.
[02:34:55.180 --> 02:34:56.241]  Just like Barack was in 2004.
[02:34:56.522 --> 02:35:00.386]  Barack once ran a voter registration organization.
[02:35:01.066 --> 02:35:02.468]  Now, so does Michelle.
[02:35:02.928 --> 02:35:04.430]  That's how we change America.
[02:35:05.051 --> 02:35:09.095]  Also, Barack Obama based his candidacy on his personal story.
[02:35:09.635 --> 02:35:11.577]  Michelle has done the exact same thing.
[02:35:12.258 --> 02:35:16.382]  But like Barack, Michelle tells a life story that is more fiction than fact.
[02:35:17.063 --> 02:35:20.144]  Maybe somebody's gonna discover that I shouldn't be here.
[02:35:20.504 --> 02:35:26.766]  Now, come along on an investigation into the real Michelle Obama and her plan for power.
[02:35:27.247 --> 02:35:31.048]  I found out Michelle's father worked for the Democrat party machine.
[02:35:31.308 --> 02:35:33.829]  My father, he was a precinct captain in Chicago.
[02:35:35.478 --> 02:35:37.199]  People would come for money.
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:40.722]  It turns out Michelle was never a part of the black community.
[02:35:40.903 --> 02:35:43.265]  In that household, there was fear.
[02:35:43.965 --> 02:35:45.206]  You talk like a white girl.
[02:35:45.366 --> 02:35:48.189]  You could get your butt kicked if you talked like a white girl.
[02:35:48.209 --> 02:35:53.233]  Okay folks, that's the first part of the trailer.
[02:35:53.673 --> 02:35:57.236]  Please go to the Infowars store, get the book or the DVD.
[02:35:57.536 --> 02:35:59.438]  You can call into the show 877-789-2539 and we'll be right back.
[02:36:03.377 --> 02:36:05.238]  Okay, everybody, Joel Gilbert back with you.
[02:36:05.298 --> 02:36:15.962]  Filmmaker in Los Angeles, encouraging everyone go to the Infowars store and get a copy of the book or the DVD, Michelle Obama 2024, Her Real Life Story and Plan for Power.
[02:36:16.642 --> 02:36:23.785]  We showed part of the trailer a minute ago, and I make the case that Michelle has been copying Barack's path to the White House.
[02:36:24.685 --> 02:36:29.228]  Barack had a voter registration organization in Chicago called Project Vote.
[02:36:29.729 --> 02:36:33.831]  Sure enough, Michelle started a voter registration organization called When We All Vote.
[02:36:34.192 --> 02:36:37.554]  She got 26 million bucks from Soros for that group.
[02:36:38.194 --> 02:36:42.838]  Barack wrote two autobiographies, Dreams from My Father and The Audacity of Hope.
[02:36:43.378 --> 02:36:46.800]  Sure enough, Michelle wrote two autobiographies, Becoming and The Light We Carry.
[02:36:46.820 --> 02:36:48.161]  They're both also on Netflix.
[02:36:48.802 --> 02:36:54.965]   And don't forget that Barack was the keynote speaker who introduced John Kerry at the 2004 Democrat Convention.
[02:36:55.525 --> 02:36:59.827]  Sure enough, they made Michelle the keynote speaker at the 2020 convention.
[02:37:00.047 --> 02:37:04.428]  Meanwhile, it's obvious to me that the Democrats have set it up for Michelle.
[02:37:04.448 --> 02:37:18.853]  They moved the first primary out of Iowa, where she would have had to campaign in 99 counties, and they put it in South Carolina, where half of the electorate for the Democrat Party primary is going to be African American, which would kind of be a slam dunk for Michelle.
[02:37:19.818 --> 02:37:24.600]  And they put the Democrat National Convention in Chicago of all places, Michelle's hometown.
[02:37:25.141 --> 02:37:26.641]  So it looks like it's set up.
[02:37:27.442 --> 02:37:29.083]  And there's a couple ways this could go down.
[02:37:29.483 --> 02:37:32.985]  Now, no one has done a critical work on Michelle's life.
[02:37:33.025 --> 02:37:39.348]  She's had 15 years of all positive publicity, hundreds of magazine covers, hundreds of interviews, TV shows, sitcoms.
[02:37:39.968 --> 02:37:41.489]  What I did is I went to Chicago.
[02:37:42.250 --> 02:37:54.098]  I talked to her mother, I talked to her high school and elementary school classmates, teachers, principals, her dance instructor from age seven, her college thesis advisor.
[02:37:54.558 --> 02:37:57.981]  So I give you a real picture of Michelle's exclusive childhood.
[02:37:58.681 --> 02:38:01.943]  Now, it's in contrast to Michelle pushing the story.
[02:38:02.023 --> 02:38:08.487]  She says, success wasn't meant for me, a little girl, black girl from the south side of Chicago.
[02:38:08.547 --> 02:38:09.667]  I was held back in life.
[02:38:10.328 --> 02:38:12.469]  All these stories of racial discrimination.
[02:38:13.009 --> 02:38:14.070]  Turns out they're all phony.
[02:38:15.191 --> 02:38:19.113]  Michelle was the one who was running away from black people.
[02:38:19.173 --> 02:38:21.194]  Michelle complains about white flight.
[02:38:21.334 --> 02:38:26.917]  She says white people would move away when black people moved into the neighborhood.
[02:38:27.178 --> 02:38:27.858]  Never happened.
[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:32.022]  And it was Michelle Obama who was running away.
[02:38:32.082 --> 02:38:38.185]  Both her and her brother refused to study at the schools in their neighborhood with all black kids and went an hour away to study with whites.
[02:38:38.806 --> 02:38:41.287]  So Michelle is the black face of white flight.
[02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:47.423]  But she wants to convince minority and black voters that, hey, I'm just one of these ordinary black folks like you.
[02:38:47.904 --> 02:38:52.406]  It's very manipulative and it's what she does to get power.
[02:38:53.127 --> 02:39:02.573]  So let's bring on right now, I want to bring on New York Times bestselling author, political icon, 45 years in American politics, Nixon, Reagan, and Trump.
[02:39:03.173 --> 02:39:04.754]  The man who invented lobbying.
[02:39:05.529 --> 02:39:08.332]  He's always on the case, never did anything wrong.
[02:39:09.072 --> 02:39:10.134]  He's always insightful.
[02:39:10.394 --> 02:39:11.295]  Proud to call him my friend.
[02:39:11.315 --> 02:39:14.578]  Let's talk to Roger Stone and get into this question of Michelle Obama.
[02:39:14.638 --> 02:39:15.579]  Roger, are you there with us?
[02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:17.701]  I am, Joel.
[02:39:17.741 --> 02:39:19.362]  I'm delighted to be with you.
[02:39:20.143 --> 02:39:30.113]  You are, without any question, probably the world's foremost expert on the real Barack Obama, the real Michelle Obama.
[02:39:31.435 --> 02:39:36.665]  You are, of course, also an accomplished documentary filmmaker.
[02:39:37.105 --> 02:39:41.794]  I'm thinking, of course, of your famous film, Banished, the Danny Williams story.
[02:39:42.635 --> 02:40:01.762]  Which I think played a pivotal role when African Americans in the United States in 2020 learned about Bill Clinton's illegitimate black son and Hillary Clinton's efforts to banish him, basically to erase him from Bill's life.
[02:40:02.282 --> 02:40:04.945]  The Untold Story of Danny Williams.
[02:40:05.486 --> 02:40:12.413]  Extraordinary film, and I think it had a very, very real impact on public thinking.
[02:40:12.954 --> 02:40:16.197]  So, once again, I think you're ahead of the curve here.
[02:40:16.217 --> 02:40:23.625]  I have been publicly out there with you, because I think the tea leaves are very clear.
[02:40:24.499 --> 02:40:51.455]   This week's New York Times, Siena College poll, a series of polls in the swing states Has really caused a palpable, almost hysterical, apoplectic panic in the Democratic Party as professional Democrats begin to realize that renominating Joe Biden has the potential to bring everybody on the ticket down with him.
[02:40:52.515 --> 02:41:13.282]   And this, it's interesting, Congressman Roe v. Kahnem, I think I'm mispronouncing that, actually quoted in NBC as saying, until David Axelrod persuades Michelle Obama to run, we don't have a strong enough candidate, essentially, to win the next election.
[02:41:13.662 --> 02:41:18.324]  There it is, a Democratic Party insider spitting it right out for you.
[02:41:20.094 --> 02:41:21.175]  Okay, well, thanks, Roger.
[02:41:21.195 --> 02:41:23.756]  Look, you've been in politics a long time.
[02:41:24.377 --> 02:41:38.286]  How toxic is Joe Biden right now, personally, with his corruption scandal finally breaking through the media surface and his horrible record with inflation, foreign wars, division, crime?
[02:41:38.486 --> 02:41:42.088]  How bad a record does Joe Biden have to run on right now?
[02:41:42.508 --> 02:41:43.449]  And how toxic is he?
[02:41:44.326 --> 02:41:46.127]  I think it's the trifecta here.
[02:41:46.247 --> 02:41:50.290]  First of all, it is his inability to perform as a president or a candidate.
[02:41:50.751 --> 02:41:53.413]  He can barely string together a coherent sentence.
[02:41:53.893 --> 02:41:56.895]  He clearly has good days and bad, good moments and bad.
[02:41:57.255 --> 02:41:59.017]  Sometimes he's completely incoherent.
[02:41:59.437 --> 02:42:00.818]  He looks frail.
[02:42:01.098 --> 02:42:07.603]  He doesn't look strong, hale and vigorous, which is how you want your president to look to all the other world leaders.
[02:42:08.103 --> 02:42:10.485]  Then you have the impact of his policies.
[02:42:11.646 --> 02:42:21.293]  Out skyrocketing fuel prices, 76% increase in the cost of basic groceries, epic runaway inflation.
[02:42:21.773 --> 02:42:33.962]  They've manipulated these employment numbers based on some advice I got from Barry Habib, a very respected economist and economic analyst.
[02:42:34.883 --> 02:42:38.306]  And we're shipping billions of dollars abroad.
[02:42:38.866 --> 02:42:43.170]  Well, we can't seem to spend money to seal our own southern border.
[02:42:43.570 --> 02:42:48.875]  So now you add on top of all of that, the epic corruption.
[02:42:48.895 --> 02:43:01.766]  I mean, the biblical size corruption of the Biden crime family, which is, you know, they have sought very hard to conceal and to censor those like the New York Post.
[02:43:02.387 --> 02:43:07.493]  And others, Breitbart News and others who have reported very accurately on this.
[02:43:08.053 --> 02:43:17.544]  I think professional Democrats realize that Joe Biden is toxic and that if he leads them into the next election, they will lose.
[02:43:18.025 --> 02:43:19.547]  Now you add on top of that.
[02:43:20.756 --> 02:43:28.943]  The fact that the entire narrative within the Republican Party, as put forward by the Republican establishment, that Trump can't win.
[02:43:29.563 --> 02:43:33.926]  Actually, what the polling shows is that Trump is the only candidate who can win.
[02:43:33.946 --> 02:43:40.211]  He is now holding a commanding lead for the Republican nomination.
[02:43:40.972 --> 02:43:42.913]  His nomination looks inevitable.
[02:43:43.594 --> 02:43:46.156]  His election looks more and more probable.
[02:43:47.016 --> 02:44:02.090]  And this, despite the fact that they have dumped an enormous load on him through this tsunami of lawfare, where they're charging him with all kinds of fabricated crimes in order to try to slow him down.
[02:44:02.110 --> 02:44:11.318]  All right, look, let's talk about, you alluded to this film which I made and you helped me with back in 2016 about Bill Clinton's black son.
[02:44:12.156 --> 02:44:19.262]  And how the black community, many rejected Hillary Clinton once they learned this information of how she treated him.
[02:44:20.864 --> 02:44:23.266]  How important is the black vote to Democrats?
[02:44:23.366 --> 02:44:31.013]  Because we've seen these polls that Donald Trump is actually getting more black males in the polls that say they're going to vote Trump this time.
[02:44:31.933 --> 02:44:38.279]  And so how important is that black vote for Democrats to get their candidate elected and how terrified are they of losing the minority vote at this point?
[02:44:39.535 --> 02:44:45.918]  The New York Times Siena College Poll showed that Trump was actually leading Joe Biden 49 to 46 among black men.
[02:44:46.298 --> 02:44:47.339]  This is unheard of.
[02:44:47.839 --> 02:44:58.884]  African Americans have always traditionally been, at least since the 50s, have been a reliable democratic core voter group.
[02:44:59.412 --> 02:45:03.235]  Now, Richard Nixon got roughly a third of the black vote in 1960.
[02:45:03.555 --> 02:45:10.240]  That was running against John Kennedy, and that was also during his mishandling of the arrest of Dr. Martin Luther King.
[02:45:10.540 --> 02:45:15.484]  So Trump had to 22%, which is probably a little understated, among African Americans.
[02:45:15.804 --> 02:45:20.207]  This would be the death knell for the National Democratic Party, and they know it.
[02:45:20.547 --> 02:45:23.770]  Joel, I look forward to talking to you about this when we get to the other side.
[02:45:24.191 --> 02:45:30.737]  But as for your prediction that Michelle Obama will be the Democratic nominee, I would put money on it today.
[02:45:31.918 --> 02:45:32.318]  Okay.
[02:45:32.779 --> 02:45:33.119]  Okay.
[02:45:33.800 --> 02:45:34.240]  All right.
[02:45:34.901 --> 02:45:37.863]  So we'll be right back with more with Roger Stone.
[02:45:38.724 --> 02:45:50.810]   Okay, Joel Gilbert, filmmaker in Los Angeles, back with you talking with Roger Stone about The inevitability of Michelle Obama 2024, her real life story and plan for power in the Infowars store.
[02:45:51.511 --> 02:45:55.874]  You can call in 877-789-2539.
[02:45:56.714 --> 02:46:00.557]  And we're still talking with Roger Stone, the man who never did anything wrong.
[02:46:01.418 --> 02:46:02.178]  He's insightful.
[02:46:02.198 --> 02:46:02.698]  He's brilliant.
[02:46:02.718 --> 02:46:03.459]  He's an icon.
[02:46:04.099 --> 02:46:05.660]  Welcome back to Roger Stone with us.
[02:46:08.142 --> 02:46:09.323]  Go Roger, you just spoke.
[02:46:10.404 --> 02:46:10.744]  All right.
[02:46:11.641 --> 02:46:16.344]  We just spoke about how important the black vote was for Democrats to get their people elected.
[02:46:17.145 --> 02:46:26.511]  And similar to what happened with the banish, the untold story of Danny Williams, how that affected black voters, I think that black voters are no fools.
[02:46:27.051 --> 02:46:43.795]   And then when they find out Michelle's real life story and her terrible relationship with the black community in Chicago, as depicted in my film and book, I don't think they're going to support the Obamas because I chronicled how Michelle Refused to study with other black kids.
[02:46:43.835 --> 02:46:49.517]  Her and her brother went to different high schools, even though they had a good school block from their house, they didn't want to stay with black people.
[02:46:50.138 --> 02:46:53.239]  As you saw in the trailer, Michelle was afraid of black people.
[02:46:53.299 --> 02:46:54.440]  She wouldn't go out of her house.
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:47:00.202]  The kids would beat her up, call her an Oreo, meaning you're black on the outside, but really white on the inside.
[02:47:00.222 --> 02:47:01.283]  It was a racial insult.
[02:47:02.223 --> 02:47:08.466]  And I chronicle in the film how Michelle got her revenge on the black community working for white liberals in Chicago.
[02:47:09.136 --> 02:47:13.577]  White liberals could not hire a white person to kick 20,000 black people out of their home.
[02:47:14.158 --> 02:47:17.839]  Michelle took the job, and she told the black people it'd be good for them.
[02:47:18.079 --> 02:47:28.282]  Having proven she could do the dirty work, Michelle was hired by the University of Chicago Medical Center, and her job was to prevent black people from the South Side from using the emergency room.
[02:47:29.102 --> 02:47:33.123]  Michelle would put them in a van and dump them back at these crappy clinics on the South Side.
[02:47:33.764 --> 02:47:43.406]   So, she's very insecure about her relationship with the black community, and I think Once this film and book become disseminated, I think the black community is going to have very serious questions for her.
[02:47:43.966 --> 02:47:50.313]  And if I were Donald Trump, I would open a whole can of worms by simply saying, Michelle, are you going to apologize for what you did to the black community?
[02:47:50.733 --> 02:47:51.934]  I think that'll get some attention.
[02:47:53.236 --> 02:47:56.179]  Let me ask you regarding the keynote speaker slot.
[02:47:58.081 --> 02:48:02.865]  Who does the Democrat Party choose for their keynote speaker to introduce the candidate?
[02:48:03.326 --> 02:48:04.407]  And what's the significance?
[02:48:04.447 --> 02:48:08.110]  Barack Obama was the keynote speaker for John Kerry in 2004.
[02:48:08.630 --> 02:48:11.173]  There was Michelle Obama, keynote speaker for Joe Biden.
[02:48:11.533 --> 02:48:16.097]  What does that slot mean in terms of the future and people being a candidate?
[02:48:17.658 --> 02:48:20.441]  I think it is a very solid predictor.
[02:48:21.242 --> 02:48:28.589]  And the fact that in many ways, Michelle Obama is following the path blazed by her husband.
[02:48:29.189 --> 02:48:32.392]  He had two largely fictitious biographies.
[02:48:32.893 --> 02:48:36.436]  She has two largely fictitious biographies.
[02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:39.841]  Uh, he was a community organizer.
[02:48:40.201 --> 02:48:42.962]  She's now posing as a community organizer.
[02:48:42.982 --> 02:48:48.965]  Uh, he gave the keynote speech when the Democrats nominated John Kerry.
[02:48:48.985 --> 02:48:51.426]  Uh, I believe that was 2012, I guess.
[02:48:51.446 --> 02:48:51.426]  2004, 2004.
[02:48:55.536 --> 02:48:55.917]  Pardon me.
[02:48:56.758 --> 02:49:00.803]  And she gave the keynote speech when they nominated Joe Biden.
[02:49:01.644 --> 02:49:08.253]  But those who scoff at her candidacy, I think, make a cataclysmic mistake.
[02:49:09.134 --> 02:49:10.196]  There is a huge difference.
[02:49:10.536 --> 02:49:12.399]  Hillary Clinton was not black.
[02:49:13.419 --> 02:49:43.614]   Michelle Obama, like her husband, is a chameleon, and we've seen in her political past where she put aside her couture clothing and her high-style, vogue cover look to try to look more like an average black American, where affect an accent in her speeches, where she would try to
[02:49:43.614 --> 02:49:52.004]   portray herself as the non-elite that she really is. And I know a bunch of people out there
[02:49:52.004 --> 02:49:54.653]  probably making jokes about her gender.
[02:49:54.653 --> 02:50:00.814]   I think that's an enormous mistake. I think that will backfire spectacularly
[02:50:00.814 --> 02:50:03.214]  if that is the Republicans' tactic.
[02:50:03.433 --> 02:50:08.457]  The real danger here is not taking her candidacy seriously.
[02:50:08.998 --> 02:50:12.681]  She would be an extraordinarily formidable candidate.
[02:50:13.121 --> 02:50:15.784]  The Obamas can raise unlimited money.
[02:50:16.264 --> 02:50:19.407]  She carries none of the baggage of Joe Biden.
[02:50:19.927 --> 02:50:28.520]  But more precisely, Joel, I think what you have going on right now within the Democratic Party is an internecine struggle.
[02:50:28.620 --> 02:50:31.805]  Because, you see, Joe does not want to go.
[02:50:32.634 --> 02:50:34.574]  Dr. Jill does not want to go.
[02:50:35.134 --> 02:50:45.796]  Above all, Joe must maintain his legal authority to pardon his son, his brother, and probably himself and other members of the Biden crime family.
[02:50:46.976 --> 02:50:52.797]  Dr. Jill loves the trappings and the pomp and circumstance of being the first lady.
[02:50:53.478 --> 02:50:59.099]  And she spends more time, as you know, on vacation than he does on his official duties.
[02:50:59.479 --> 02:51:01.639]  So the Obamas don't want to go.
[02:51:02.367 --> 02:51:07.911]  But Barack Obama is the de facto head of the Democratic Party.
[02:51:08.372 --> 02:51:12.355]  He's most certainly the most influential Democrat in the country.
[02:51:13.175 --> 02:51:16.938]  When it comes to policy, these are really his policies.
[02:51:17.318 --> 02:51:25.765]  When it comes to all of the key foreign policy and domestic advisors around Joe Biden, they are, to a person, Obama people.
[02:51:26.065 --> 02:51:49.581]   This is, in fact, at least from an operational and policy point of view, the third term As you know, he actually joked about being able to hang out in his basement with a microphone hooked up to headphones of whoever really was president so that he could kind of dictate what was going on without having to get out of his sweats, as he put it.
[02:51:50.302 --> 02:51:51.063]  So there it is.
[02:51:51.103 --> 02:51:58.549]  There's an admission that that he is really running this country and he can dominate the Democratic Party if he chooses to do so.
[02:51:59.469 --> 02:52:02.772]  Gavin Newsom is auditioning for vice president.
[02:52:02.812 --> 02:52:03.893]  He may not know that yet.
[02:52:04.568 --> 02:52:07.190]  But that's the role that they have for him.
[02:52:07.610 --> 02:52:17.636]  And here's why if you replace Joe Biden, it has to be Michelle Obama, because it's the only way for them to justify passing over Vice President Harris.
[02:52:18.176 --> 02:52:26.298]   The only way you can justify within their party passing over a woman of of color who is the sitting vice president and under
[02:52:26.298 --> 02:52:32.128]   political norms would be next in line for the nomination is by nominating a stronger, better
[02:52:32.128 --> 02:52:35.318]   known, more popular woman of color.
[02:52:35.318 --> 02:52:37.558]  That would be Michelle Obama.
[02:52:37.558 --> 02:52:43.097]   I'll agree with you that when you say the Bidens don't want to go, I think the best
[02:52:43.097 --> 02:52:48.118]   indication of that was when Joe Biden released his three minute announcement video back in
[02:52:48.118 --> 02:52:50.398]  April, which is not really an announcement.
[02:52:50.437 --> 02:52:55.740]  Usually you go to a massive crowd and you travel around the country and you see all your followers.
[02:52:55.780 --> 02:52:58.201]  It was just a three minute video saying he's running again.
[02:52:58.841 --> 02:53:00.522]  And Susan Rice quit the next day.
[02:53:00.883 --> 02:53:03.204]  Now, Susan Rice is definitely on Team Obama.
[02:53:03.840 --> 02:53:10.365]  And I think that was an indication that they don't completely control Biden, that he desperately wants to stay in power.
[02:53:10.405 --> 02:53:11.246]  His wife likes it.
[02:53:12.106 --> 02:53:16.730]  And at this point, I think Biden doesn't necessarily even have to drop out.
[02:53:16.810 --> 02:53:27.458]  Just like Ted Kennedy ran against Jimmy Carter, Michelle could announce her president, say that, you know, she loves this nation and people have asked her to run and she doesn't want to see Trump win again.
[02:53:28.058 --> 02:53:31.160]  And Biden can run all he wants and he'll get trounced in South Carolina.
[02:53:33.948 --> 02:53:35.429]  You know, he'll drop out at some point.
[02:53:35.449 --> 02:53:36.590]  It almost won't matter.
[02:53:36.610 --> 02:53:37.671]  He can stay as a lame duck.
[02:53:38.211 --> 02:53:42.074]  So I'll agree that there's some level of Biden being completely arrogant.
[02:53:43.414 --> 02:53:47.377]  I think what we're going to do is if you can stay, Roger, we'll take a couple of calls after the break.
[02:53:47.837 --> 02:53:55.683]  I'm reminding everyone, go to the InfoWars store, get the book and the film, Michelle Obama 2024, her real life story and plan for power.
[02:53:56.363 --> 02:53:57.284]  It'll change your life.
[02:53:57.324 --> 02:53:59.965]  You have no idea what Michelle Obama really is all about.
[02:54:00.886 --> 02:54:10.500]   She's somebody who Exploited the black community in her professional career and was afraid of black people all her life and is trying to manipulate them with these phony stories.
[02:54:11.160 --> 02:54:13.261]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone on Infowars.
[02:54:13.781 --> 02:54:15.341]  Call in 877-789-2539.
[02:54:15.721 --> 02:54:20.203]  Filmmaker Joel Gilbert back here with you from Los Angeles.
[02:54:20.954 --> 02:54:29.101]  Asking you to go to the Infowars store, get my film and or book, Michelle Obama 2024, her real life story and plan for power.
[02:54:29.602 --> 02:54:35.387]  You have to know who Michelle Obama really is because she's put forth a fabricated story for many years.
[02:54:36.348 --> 02:54:44.735]  You might remember back in 2008, Michelle was on the campaign trail by herself promoting Barack Obama and she had huge crowds.
[02:54:44.835 --> 02:54:46.917]  She's actually a better politician than Barack.
[02:54:46.937 --> 02:54:47.798]  She's a better speaker.
[02:54:48.826 --> 02:54:52.887]  Both Barack and Michelle had a professor at Harvard called Charles Ogletree.
[02:54:53.467 --> 02:54:59.208]  And he actually said that between Michelle and Barack, he thought it would be Michelle a run for president and not Barack.
[02:54:59.908 --> 02:55:06.490]  But you might remember Michelle was trashing America back in 2008 every single night to these massive crowds.
[02:55:06.550 --> 02:55:08.450]  She said things like, you can't pay your mortgage.
[02:55:08.490 --> 02:55:10.410]  You can't afford childcare in this country.
[02:55:10.790 --> 02:55:11.871]  You can't afford healthcare.
[02:55:11.911 --> 02:55:13.011]  Don't get sick in this country.
[02:55:13.551 --> 02:55:18.572]  And one night she said, for the first time in my life, I'm proud of my country because Barack won a primary.
[02:55:19.582 --> 02:55:21.282]  Now that got the media's attention.
[02:55:21.322 --> 02:55:22.643]  She said a lot worse things than that.
[02:55:23.183 --> 02:55:26.323]  That's when the Obama campaign told her, it said, look, we could lose because of you.
[02:55:26.443 --> 02:55:28.644]  So the next day she said, oh, I hate politics.
[02:55:29.124 --> 02:55:30.844]  And she's kind of kept that up for years.
[02:55:30.904 --> 02:55:32.564]  But Michelle is a political activist.
[02:55:32.624 --> 02:55:36.745]  Her father was a precinct captain in Chicago, working for the Democrat Party machine.
[02:55:37.205 --> 02:55:42.686]  He had a patronage job, meaning he got a cushy job with the water department so he could do politics.
[02:55:43.306 --> 02:55:45.266]  Michelle grew up in Jesse Jackson's house.
[02:55:45.866 --> 02:55:48.927]  She was friends with his daughter Santita when Jackson was running for president.
[02:55:49.511 --> 02:55:51.973]  So there's a whole different Michelle Obama you need to know about.
[02:55:52.253 --> 02:55:52.993]  Let's take some calls.
[02:55:53.013 --> 02:55:56.396]  Let's start in North Carolina with Tired of Tyrants.
[02:55:56.756 --> 02:55:57.536]  Take some questions.
[02:55:59.177 --> 02:56:00.058]  How you doing Joe?
[02:56:00.138 --> 02:56:02.399]  I appreciate the work that you put in on this.
[02:56:03.712 --> 02:56:11.497]  Roger Stone brought up a very good point about people falling down the rabbit hole of the gender thing, and that was actually my question for you.
[02:56:11.978 --> 02:56:22.365]  We already know that the CIA washes people's histories and creates people's histories for us to do investigation things that end up not being true at all.
[02:56:23.085 --> 02:56:25.627]  And is there a lot of information?
[02:56:25.727 --> 02:56:40.456]  I don't discredit anything of the research that you did on Michelle, but is there a possibility that some of the research that you did is fraudulent research just created by the CIA to make up this image of this Michelle that we don't know about?
[02:56:41.417 --> 02:56:43.318]  No, I can assure you that I went to Chicago.
[02:56:44.078 --> 02:56:51.663]  I talked to her classmates, principals, friends, neighbors, the woman who sold the house that she lived in to Michelle's aunt.
[02:56:52.541 --> 02:56:53.022]  Everybody.
[02:56:53.082 --> 02:56:54.823]  And I even got her high school yearbooks.
[02:56:54.863 --> 02:57:00.789]  For instance, here's a picture of Michelle in her dance class from her high school yearbook, age 16.
[02:57:01.309 --> 02:57:03.071]  Now, she's obviously female.
[02:57:04.753 --> 02:57:09.157]  So that's just a kind of a joke that when Joan Rivers made that joke that, well, Michelle's transgender.
[02:57:09.737 --> 02:57:15.141]  And Michelle uses that in her book, Becoming, to say that people are racist and they other her.
[02:57:15.362 --> 02:57:17.123]  So she uses this kind of criticism.
[02:57:17.563 --> 02:57:18.925]  Michelle is a total phony.
[02:57:19.525 --> 02:57:22.608]  She is an Oreo, like the kids called her when she was little.
[02:57:22.908 --> 02:57:25.690]  She's black on the outside, but she's white on the inside.
[02:57:26.531 --> 02:57:28.813]  She grew up watching the Brady Bunch.
[02:57:28.853 --> 02:57:30.614]  She said her hero was Mary Tyler Moore.
[02:57:31.295 --> 02:57:34.137]  When Barack met her family, she said they were like, leave it to Beaver.
[02:57:35.530 --> 02:57:36.991]  Michelle was afraid of black kids.
[02:57:37.031 --> 02:57:37.791]  They would beat her up.
[02:57:38.311 --> 02:57:39.692]  She refused to study with them.
[02:57:40.472 --> 02:57:46.975]  And the film goes into great detail how Michelle got her revenge on the black community, exploiting them in her professional career.
[02:57:47.355 --> 02:57:49.676]  So it's a very thorough documentary and film.
[02:57:50.716 --> 02:57:55.658]  You can't know enough about Michelle Obama because I think she's going to be the next nominee.
[02:57:55.758 --> 02:57:57.079]  So there's so much to learn.
[02:57:57.699 --> 02:57:59.340]  And everything she's told us is not true.
[02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:01.421]  Let's go to Virginia for Owl Killer.
[02:58:01.461 --> 02:58:02.061]  Let's talk to him.
[02:58:04.744 --> 02:58:16.473]  Hey, so Joel, I have a, you know, you bring up how Michelle Obama, I was unaware that she was responsible for kicking black people out of their homes.
[02:58:17.594 --> 02:58:26.961]  And it almost, now that you bring that up, that seems like how she made her bones, same way how Hillary Clinton was defending the pedophiles down in Arkansas.
[02:58:27.482 --> 02:58:36.143]   And I almost think that these are both arranged marriages, because if you think that, um, Bill Clinton is in love with Hillary Clinton.
[02:58:36.623 --> 02:58:37.804]  Forget about it.
[02:58:37.904 --> 02:58:48.373]  And then with Michelle Obama and Barack Obama, Tucker Carlson alluded to the fact that there seems to be something that's not right with the marriage, and people didn't want to touch on it.
[02:58:51.511 --> 02:58:52.472]  Yeah, let me talk about that.
[02:58:52.552 --> 02:59:01.197]  I think the relationship is genuine with Barack and Michelle and I think the original attraction was Barack actually didn't know any black people.
[02:59:01.217 --> 02:59:02.398]  He didn't grow up with black people.
[02:59:02.458 --> 02:59:05.820]  His roommates in college were Pakistanis.
[02:59:05.900 --> 02:59:15.044]   He had an Asian mixed girlfriend and he actually broke up with her telling her he needed a black wife For politics.
[02:59:15.285 --> 02:59:24.570]  So Obama was looking for a black woman to feel more black and to be accepted in the black community because he grew up with white grandparents in Hawaii and black people didn't think he was black.
[02:59:25.310 --> 02:59:27.952]  Michelle, on the other hand, was afraid of black people.
[02:59:27.992 --> 02:59:28.672]  They beat her up.
[02:59:29.632 --> 02:59:31.013]  She refused to study with them.
[02:59:31.674 --> 02:59:32.994]  She moved to Hyde Park.
[02:59:33.114 --> 02:59:35.236]  She couldn't get away from black people fast enough.
[02:59:35.896 --> 02:59:40.058]  So Barack, for Michelle, because he was biracial, made her feel more white.
[02:59:40.559 --> 02:59:44.221]   So they each You know, wanted to feel more black or for more white.
[02:59:44.301 --> 02:59:45.766]  I think that was the original attraction.
[02:59:46.579 --> 02:59:57.226]  But the Clintons and the Obamas are very similar in that the husband is a real friendly guy who gets people excited, but they're both very disorganized.
[02:59:57.286 --> 03:00:05.411]  And it's the woman in the relationship, Hillary and Michelle, who are the ones that drive the politics and say, you've got to meet this person, you've got to go here, you've got to go there.
[03:00:05.731 --> 03:00:10.014]  Michelle got a job at the mayor's office in Chicago to get Barack connections.
[03:00:10.174 --> 03:00:13.216]  She's the one that got Tony Rescoe involved with Barack's campaign.
[03:00:13.656 --> 03:00:16.758]  Michelle's the one that worked for Valerie Jarrett and introduced her to him.
[03:00:17.378 --> 03:00:19.980]  So there's a whole relationship there.
[03:00:20.140 --> 03:00:23.002]  And I think like Hillary Clinton, Michelle wants to run for president.
[03:00:23.022 --> 03:00:26.784]  She's a political animal and she does politics all the time.
[03:00:27.584 --> 03:00:28.725]  Let's go to Mike in Ohio.
[03:00:31.397 --> 03:00:35.339]  Hey, John, I'm speaking with you both, and I really loved your work in Banished, Bill's son.
[03:00:35.399 --> 03:00:39.822]  I feel like in some ways, though, Obama's brother is a Bill's son experience story.
[03:00:40.142 --> 03:00:54.410]  What I kind of wanted to ask you is this, since we're hearing all these fairy tales, like North Korea, Kim Jong-un style, do you think there's any way this could actually backfire on them, between the racial division that's going on, between the fact that we don't trust the party anymore, most of the country doesn't?
[03:00:54.671 --> 03:00:58.753]  I know this is maybe a naive question, is there any way in the world that this could backfire upon them?
[03:01:00.122 --> 03:01:03.103]  I think there is, look, there is a backlash in the black community.
[03:01:03.143 --> 03:01:17.648]  There certainly was in 2016 when millions of people saw my film Banished, and we heard from Danny Williams' aunt, Lucille, and she talked about how she brought Danny to the governor's mansion in Arkansas, knocked on the door, and Hillary slammed the door in their face.
[03:01:18.328 --> 03:01:30.279]   So, I don't think the black community likes to be trashed and discriminated against, and Michelle Obama's been pulling off a Manipulation of the black community.
[03:01:30.299 --> 03:01:32.139]  It's the same thing her father did in Chicago.
[03:01:32.179 --> 03:01:38.302]  Her father's job was a precinct captain to get the black community out to vote for the white machine, the white liberals.
[03:01:39.282 --> 03:01:42.103]  Michelle's manipulated the black community very badly in 2008.
[03:01:42.503 --> 03:01:50.106]  She would speak to black audiences with a fake urban accent, phony accent, to trick them into thinking I'm one of you.
[03:01:50.726 --> 03:01:53.227]  Today you could be arrested for a hate crime for doing what she did.
[03:01:54.019 --> 03:02:02.507]  So, Michelle tells these stories, like I go through this in the film, she's been telling this story for years about her guidance counselor at Whitney Young High School.
[03:02:03.148 --> 03:02:10.535]  She said, racially profiled her and said, oh, you're going to Whitney Young, you want to go to Princeton, you're black, maybe you're stretching.
[03:02:11.396 --> 03:02:13.378]  And Michelle talked about how it made her feel so bad.
[03:02:13.398 --> 03:02:18.443]  Well, I found out her high school guidance counselor was a church-going black woman named Nan King.
[03:02:18.996 --> 03:02:20.979]  So there's no way she racially profiled her.
[03:02:21.019 --> 03:02:25.346]  The worst thing she could have said was, Michelle, you know, your test scores are too low for Princeton.
[03:02:25.867 --> 03:02:28.310]  You might want to apply to some other schools as a backup.
[03:02:28.471 --> 03:02:29.813]  That's the worst thing she could have said.
[03:02:30.313 --> 03:02:33.779]  So Michelle lies to manipulate minority voters.
[03:02:34.688 --> 03:02:38.052]  She's wearing braids for the first time in her life, kind of an urban hairstyle.
[03:02:38.432 --> 03:02:42.917]  And she said, oh, I never wore braids in the White House because America couldn't handle it, you know?
[03:02:43.357 --> 03:02:46.801]  So it's obvious she's trying to trick black voters into thinking she's one of them.
[03:02:46.841 --> 03:02:52.126]  Michelle had a celebrity hairstylist named Michael Ronnie Flowers, who I interviewed in Chicago since she was 18.
[03:02:52.967 --> 03:02:54.208]  She never wore braids in her life.
[03:02:55.109 --> 03:02:56.811]  So Michelle's very, very manipulative.
[03:02:57.649 --> 03:03:01.332]  And the people she's manipulated most her whole life are the black community.
[03:03:01.893 --> 03:03:03.194]  She was afraid of them growing up.
[03:03:03.234 --> 03:03:04.575]  She refused to study with them.
[03:03:05.056 --> 03:03:09.920]  She exploited them, kicked them out of the hospital, denied them access to health care, kicked them out of their homes.
[03:03:10.601 --> 03:03:14.264]  And she wants to trick them into thinking that, hey, I'm just one of these ordinary black folks like you.
[03:03:14.304 --> 03:03:15.365]  I suffer discrimination.
[03:03:15.785 --> 03:03:20.390]  I think the film and book Michelle Obama 2024, her real life story and plan for power.
[03:03:20.470 --> 03:03:21.070]  Get to know it.
[03:03:21.551 --> 03:03:22.792]  Get it in the Infowars store.
[03:03:23.772 --> 03:03:28.193]  And you'll find out what Michelle Obama really is all about and she's no friend of the black community.
[03:03:28.914 --> 03:03:34.575]  And I think there will be a backlash when the black community understands what she did to them in her professional career.
[03:03:34.635 --> 03:03:35.256]  We'll be right back.
[03:03:36.916 --> 03:03:43.458]  Filmmaker Joel Gilbert, an author of Michelle Obama 2024, a real life story and plan for power.
[03:03:44.138 --> 03:03:47.559]  Please go to the Infowars store and get the book or the film or both.
[03:03:48.180 --> 03:03:52.701]  Spend the next 10 minutes talking about something very shocking and I'll take a few more calls.
[03:03:53.779 --> 03:03:58.581]  Michelle Obama, I found out, her best friend in Chicago was a domestic terrorist.
[03:03:58.621 --> 03:04:09.306]  None other than Bill Ayer's wife, Bernadine Dorn, one of the heads of the Weather Underground, the brains behind the Weather Underground domestic terror group, who's been accused of murdering policemen herself.
[03:04:10.467 --> 03:04:15.229]  And she worked with Michelle at the Sidley Austin law firm for two years in Chicago.
[03:04:15.962 --> 03:04:20.406]  And then Michelle and Barack would go to their house for dinners in the 90s for years.
[03:04:21.086 --> 03:04:26.490]  So you can't overstate the amount of influence that these domestic terrorists had on Michelle.
[03:04:26.550 --> 03:04:30.714]  So much so that Michelle was mimicking Bernadine Dorn.
[03:04:30.854 --> 03:04:32.435]  All her anti-American rhetoric.
[03:04:32.535 --> 03:04:34.176]  You can't buy food in this country.
[03:04:34.216 --> 03:04:35.778]  You can't afford your mortgage.
[03:04:36.478 --> 03:04:41.602]  All the anti-American thing, especially something called the politics of fear.
[03:04:41.702 --> 03:04:46.186]  Bernadine Doran talked about in the 60s, how Americans are all afraid of each other.
[03:04:46.306 --> 03:04:48.988]  And that's why our policies are all based on fear.
[03:04:49.608 --> 03:04:51.449]  And Michelle would mimic her word for word.
[03:04:51.469 --> 03:04:53.191]  I want you to see this video from the movie.
[03:04:53.211 --> 03:04:54.652]  It's a video I call fear.
[03:04:56.519 --> 03:05:00.162]  When you are afraid of everyone and everything, it's hard to see past that fear.
[03:05:00.622 --> 03:05:05.025]  It must have been Bernadine Dorn who taught Michelle about fear.
[03:05:05.366 --> 03:05:06.607]  The politics of fear.
[03:05:07.047 --> 03:05:08.188]  The politics of fear.
[03:05:08.208 --> 03:05:09.188]  Because of fear.
[03:05:09.349 --> 03:05:10.169]  Your fear!
[03:05:10.549 --> 03:05:14.713]  We... You know, we're all afraid of each other.
[03:05:14.773 --> 03:05:20.937]  So Michelle gets a lot of her political outlook from being radicalized by domestic terrorists.
[03:05:21.037 --> 03:05:23.239]  So you find out everything about Michelle's life.
[03:05:24.077 --> 03:05:31.459]  Uh, her two kids, you're gonna find out from my film, and Michelle's mother even agreed with me that the second child is probably not Barack's.
[03:05:31.959 --> 03:05:33.700]  Michelle had an affair with a family friend.
[03:05:33.720 --> 03:05:34.680]  You can learn about that.
[03:05:35.461 --> 03:05:40.022]  And, uh, Michelle's history at, uh, Princeton University and her thesis.
[03:05:40.522 --> 03:05:43.363]  I talked to her college thesis advisor.
[03:05:43.443 --> 03:05:46.404]  You find out everything about that thesis that nobody knows about.
[03:05:46.884 --> 03:05:49.485]  Turns out Michelle wanted to get away from the black community.
[03:05:49.525 --> 03:05:51.225]  She always wanted to distance herself.
[03:05:51.765 --> 03:05:55.207]   But for politics, she pretends that She's just one of them.
[03:05:55.447 --> 03:05:56.407]  So that's what you're going to learn.
[03:05:56.687 --> 03:05:59.509]  Let's go ahead and take some more calls for Jefferson in Virginia.
[03:05:59.529 --> 03:06:03.131]  Hey Mr. Gilbert, thanks for taking my call.
[03:06:04.711 --> 03:06:04.911]  Sure.
[03:06:05.732 --> 03:06:16.857]  When it comes to the daughters, don't you think it's much more likely that a mother that went through IVF treatment to have the first daughter would be very proud of her pregnancy and have pictures of that pregnancy from the very beginning all the way through?
[03:06:17.098 --> 03:06:18.018]  Where are those pictures?
[03:06:18.338 --> 03:06:21.740]  And isn't it more likely the children are actually the Nesbitt's and the Blanchard's children?
[03:06:23.095 --> 03:06:26.336]  Well, I think the pregnancy pictures aren't as important.
[03:06:26.356 --> 03:06:27.997]  I actually have seen one picture of Michelle.
[03:06:28.037 --> 03:06:29.297]  She looks pregnant at a dinner.
[03:06:29.877 --> 03:06:35.239]  But Michelle does talk in her book, Becoming, about doing IVF treatment for the first daughter.
[03:06:35.299 --> 03:06:38.220]  She spends about six pages taking us through the whole process.
[03:06:39.053 --> 03:06:50.204]  Then, in the year 2000, when her and Barack were not on speaking terms, when Barack ran against Bobby Rush for Congress and lost, and Michelle told him not to run, and Barack ran through all their money.
[03:06:50.224 --> 03:06:51.185]  You learn about all of this.
[03:06:51.706 --> 03:06:57.512]  Barack came here to Los Angeles to the Democrat Party Convention on his credit card and he couldn't even get in.
[03:06:58.152 --> 03:06:59.954]  So, Michelle was not even speaking to him.
[03:06:59.994 --> 03:07:03.217]  There's talk that she, you know, was talking to people about divorce.
[03:07:04.058 --> 03:07:12.206]  And then all of a sudden, that summer, in her book, she says, I did the IVF treatment and it worked right away.
[03:07:13.007 --> 03:07:22.255]   It kind of doesn't make sense that when they weren't on speaking terms and that they weren't We're talking about divorce, even, that they decided to do an IVF process.
[03:07:22.295 --> 03:07:26.699]  An IVF process takes about eight weeks, and you need cooperation of both members of the couple.
[03:07:26.719 --> 03:07:33.865]  So it's very far-fetched that during that turbulent time, which I chronicle in the film and book, that they said, oh, we need to have another kid.
[03:07:34.546 --> 03:07:45.469]   So I think there's a family friend, that Michelle had an affair with, I'll make you buy the film and read the book to find out.
[03:07:45.509 --> 03:07:50.130]  But I even talked to Michelle's mother, believe it or not, on camera, and she agreed with me.
[03:07:51.751 --> 03:07:53.412]  The two daughters look nothing alike.
[03:07:53.452 --> 03:07:54.832]  They don't look like half-sisters.
[03:07:55.273 --> 03:08:00.635]  And it turns out Sasha, the younger daughter, is the spitting image of the family friend.
[03:08:00.715 --> 03:08:02.776]  So I think that's a big expose in the movie.
[03:08:02.936 --> 03:08:04.276]  Let's go to Bart in Georgia.
[03:08:05.917 --> 03:08:06.037]  Yeah.
[03:08:06.934 --> 03:08:07.395]  Yes, sir.
[03:08:07.455 --> 03:08:08.596]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:08:08.676 --> 03:08:10.117]  And thank you, Roger Stone.
[03:08:10.397 --> 03:08:16.063]  Roger Stone has been saying he thinks Michelle, as Alex calls her Big Mike, is going to run.
[03:08:16.083 --> 03:08:19.726]  My personal belief, she's more masculine than Michelle.
[03:08:19.746 --> 03:08:22.849]  And if she really does have a penis, she's never going to pass the exam.
[03:08:22.890 --> 03:08:25.092]  But it's just my gut feeling she's not going to run.
[03:08:25.452 --> 03:08:28.415]  And nobody has a chance against Trump unless they steal the election.
[03:08:29.662 --> 03:08:32.525]  Well, look, Michelle brings what I call plausibility.
[03:08:32.966 --> 03:08:39.534]  If the media tells us that Joe Biden is leading in all the swing states, which they're not, they're actually telling us he's not, you wouldn't believe it.
[03:08:40.135 --> 03:08:44.319]  If they said Joe Biden won on election night, no one's going to believe it.
[03:08:45.080 --> 03:08:51.279]   If they say Michelle won on election night, we'd say, well, I guess I believe that because she's so popular.
[03:08:51.679 --> 03:09:00.323]  So the people that want to stuff ballots and ballot harvest like we have here in California, every single address gets ballots in the mail.
[03:09:00.543 --> 03:09:04.325]  Just here in Los Angeles, in the San Fernando Valley, there are one million apartments.
[03:09:04.986 --> 03:09:10.708]  You can imagine how many people have moved over the years from these apartments, but they all get ballots in the mail.
[03:09:11.189 --> 03:09:13.390]  And people have moved, so there's stacks of ballots.
[03:09:14.449 --> 03:09:14.689]  Yeah.
[03:09:14.769 --> 03:09:14.869]  Okay.
[03:09:14.688 --> 03:09:18.328]   up on the outside of these mailboxes and who knows who picks them up and who
[03:09:18.328 --> 03:09:21.487]  knows who stuffs them in these, in these drop boxes.
[03:09:21.487 --> 03:09:26.728]   So no matter what they do, if they nominate Michelle, people are going to
[03:09:26.728 --> 03:09:28.268]  believe it because she's so popular.
[03:09:28.268 --> 03:09:31.448]   And that's what I think she helps bring to the table for the people that want to cheat.
[03:09:31.448 --> 03:09:33.768]  Let's go to white tiger here in California.
[03:09:33.768 --> 03:09:37.227]  Yeah.
[03:09:37.227 --> 03:09:38.207]  Okay.
[03:09:38.207 --> 03:09:39.128]  Just so hello.
[03:09:39.128 --> 03:09:40.248]  Yes, sir.
[03:09:40.248 --> 03:09:40.648]  Go ahead.
[03:09:40.648 --> 03:09:41.608]  Okay.
[03:09:41.608 --> 03:09:42.768]  I'll wait, like cut out a little bit.
[03:09:43.044 --> 03:09:52.449]  Yeah, so for anyone who didn't pay attention during Obama's administration, people were just like, whenever Obama's president, he gives a speech and no one cares.
[03:09:52.929 --> 03:09:57.752]  Well, what we're doing with Biden, we're bombing Syria again.
[03:09:58.052 --> 03:09:59.673]  This is the old Obama playbook.
[03:10:00.494 --> 03:10:26.208]   And I think everything that you're saying about their upbringing is kind of bringing to light this Harvard, because to me, they're just Harvard elite We're going into a greater ground conflict in the Middle East and Iran and Hezbollah and Hamas are all now waged in this bigger conflict and I think it's, you know, a world war is definitely going to have an effect on us.
[03:10:26.248 --> 03:10:36.855]   So, you know, everything like Roger Stone is the man because they went after people like Roger Stone because They were trying to do a bogus Russian conspiracy.
[03:10:36.895 --> 03:10:38.616]  It's like, well, first of all, Trump is president.
[03:10:38.676 --> 03:10:39.676]  None of this would be happening.
[03:10:39.696 --> 03:10:41.737]  We need Trump to unleash America.
[03:10:41.757 --> 03:10:42.577]  Let me comment.
[03:10:42.597 --> 03:10:43.457]  You're bringing up a lot of things.
[03:10:43.477 --> 03:10:44.598]  Let me comment on one real quick.
[03:10:44.618 --> 03:10:50.520]  You mentioned about them being Harvard elites in her book Becoming, and that's why you can tell she's running for president.
[03:10:50.560 --> 03:10:53.081]  Michelle wrote an autobiography as a relatively young person.
[03:10:53.101 --> 03:10:56.262]  She's written two, and she rewrites history.
[03:10:56.869 --> 03:10:59.230]  She doesn't want you to know she's a Harvard elite lawyer.
[03:10:59.290 --> 03:11:05.432]  So in her book, she talks about going to Princeton and then she says, I went to law school and then I moved back to Chicago and got a job.
[03:11:05.752 --> 03:11:07.033]  She doesn't say I went to Harvard.
[03:11:07.713 --> 03:11:09.774]  Same thing happened in 2008 campaign.
[03:11:10.534 --> 03:11:11.974]  She was a big fashionista.
[03:11:12.014 --> 03:11:14.015]  She went to the Miracle Mile in Chicago.
[03:11:14.075 --> 03:11:18.477]  She was on the top 25 best dress list, international best dress list in 2005.
[03:11:19.877 --> 03:11:25.139]  Michelle got her fashion from Maria Pinto and Ikram Goldman, all these fashion designers.
[03:11:25.999 --> 03:11:28.281]  And then she turns up on the campaign trail for Barack.
[03:11:28.301 --> 03:11:30.784]  She doesn't say, hey, I'm another Harvard lawyer like my husband.
[03:11:31.384 --> 03:11:33.266]  She shows up looking like a homeless person.
[03:11:33.647 --> 03:11:34.888]  She wears an old T-shirt.
[03:11:34.968 --> 03:11:35.969]  She doesn't comb her hair.
[03:11:36.710 --> 03:11:42.435]  And she tries to look like some ordinary black housewife from the 1950s, like maybe she saw on TV.
[03:11:42.475 --> 03:11:43.216]  Looks ridiculous.
[03:11:43.757 --> 03:11:51.403]  So if you look back at those videos of her campaigning, she uses her fashion and her look and doesn't comb her hair and looks like some kind of homeless person.
[03:11:51.943 --> 03:11:56.527]  Back in the White House, of course, she goes back to being this big fashionista and on all these magazine covers.
[03:11:57.047 --> 03:11:58.468]  So Michelle is a total phony.
[03:11:59.569 --> 03:12:03.692]  And the biggest vulnerability, I think, is her terrible relationship with the black community.
[03:12:04.393 --> 03:12:12.235]   I chronicle in the movie and book, and again, go to Infowarsstore.com, Michelle was afraid of black kids growing up.
[03:12:12.335 --> 03:12:13.516]  She wanted nothing to do with them.
[03:12:13.576 --> 03:12:14.737]  She had no black friends.
[03:12:15.137 --> 03:12:18.080]  Her and her brother refused to study at schools with other blacks.
[03:12:18.601 --> 03:12:21.583]  Her brother went to a Catholic high school, even though they weren't Catholic.
[03:12:21.924 --> 03:12:23.165]  Very expensive private school.
[03:12:24.286 --> 03:12:27.829]  And Michelle, as a professional, got her revenge on the black community.
[03:12:27.869 --> 03:12:31.132]  They couldn't hire a white person to kick 20,000 blacks out of their homes.
[03:12:31.532 --> 03:12:33.054]  So the white liberals hired Michelle.
[03:12:33.832 --> 03:12:36.273]  She kicked the blacks out of the projects.
[03:12:36.913 --> 03:12:41.515]  She was assistant planning commissioner for Mayor Daley, and she told them be good for them.
[03:12:42.475 --> 03:12:49.538]  And then having proven she could do the dirty work, the University of Chicago Medical Center hired Michelle to kick black people out of the emergency room because they were losing money.
[03:12:50.058 --> 03:12:52.739]  A lot of them came from the South Side and didn't have good insurance.
[03:12:53.339 --> 03:12:57.781]  So Michelle made sure that the beds in the hospital were kept for which white people?
[03:12:59.398 --> 03:13:03.661]  If you showed up and you were black, Michelle would put you in a van and ship you back to the South Side.
[03:13:03.701 --> 03:13:05.002]  It was called patient dumping.
[03:13:05.062 --> 03:13:05.962]  It was actually illegal.
[03:13:06.743 --> 03:13:08.784]  And Michelle would dump you at these crappy clinics.
[03:13:08.824 --> 03:13:10.866]  And I actually visit those clinics in the film.
[03:13:10.886 --> 03:13:13.287]  You can see how awful they are in these strip malls.
[03:13:14.828 --> 03:13:18.090]  When Michelle's father got sick, she put him in the University of Chicago Hospital.
[03:13:18.611 --> 03:13:21.473]  But other black people were denied access to healthcare by Michelle.
[03:13:21.933 --> 03:13:26.276]  So, I think the real Michelle Obama is a person that the black community never liked.
[03:13:26.917 --> 03:13:28.679]  Michelle never liked the black community.
[03:13:28.739 --> 03:13:30.300]  She never had anything to do with them.
[03:13:31.321 --> 03:13:36.845]  And these phony stories she's been promoting for years, I think, are defeated by this film and book.
[03:13:36.885 --> 03:13:38.827]  So go to the Infowars store.
[03:13:39.347 --> 03:13:43.511]  It's Michelle Obama 2024, Her Real Life Story and Plan for Power.
[03:13:44.071 --> 03:13:45.312]  I think it's coming very soon.
[03:13:46.133 --> 03:13:54.220]  Get the book and the film and learn what Michelle Obama is really all about because she's just as phony as her husband Barack, but she is a better politician.
[03:13:54.754 --> 03:13:56.394]  So thanks for being here today.
[03:13:56.394 --> 03:14:02.054]   Get the film and book, and we'll see you again next week here on InfoWars.
[03:14:02.054 --> 03:14:09.773]  I've not been this excited ever!
[03:14:09.773 --> 03:14:12.034]  (cheering)
[03:14:12.034 --> 03:14:14.034]  Wow!
[03:14:13.141 --> 03:14:15.762]  The replatforming begins now.

[03:14:27.481 --> 03:14:28.822]  You want somebody to fight the new world order?
[03:14:29.382 --> 03:14:31.243]  Well, if you're looking for that, I'm your man.
[03:14:31.824 --> 03:14:33.365]  I want to thank you all for your previous support.
[03:14:33.405 --> 03:14:38.929]  I want to thank you all for making The Great Reset and War for the World a number one national bestseller.
[03:14:39.229 --> 03:14:40.590]  It's had a huge effect.
[03:14:41.391 --> 03:14:41.951]  We've topped it.
[03:14:42.652 --> 03:14:44.293]  This new book has just come out.
[03:14:44.673 --> 03:14:47.736]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com, signed or unsigned.
[03:14:48.763 --> 03:14:49.624]  It is incredible.
[03:14:49.924 --> 03:14:54.306]  It goes through the entire globalist master plan, their activities, what makes them tick.
[03:14:55.087 --> 03:14:57.789]  And then we lay out an alternate plan for humanity.
[03:14:58.289 --> 03:15:01.571]  And unlike the globalists, we're not ordering people to follow our plan.
[03:15:01.871 --> 03:15:05.333]  We're simply giving alternatives to the dystopia they're building.
[03:15:05.573 --> 03:15:07.194]  That's why it's the Great Awakening.
[03:15:07.815 --> 03:15:12.338]  Defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[03:15:13.078 --> 03:15:25.621]  What they're selling, owning nothing, having nothing, eating bugs, castrating our children, cutting our daughters' breasts off, World War III with Russia, human smuggling, open borders, drag queen pedophile time.
[03:15:26.061 --> 03:15:33.143]  What they're selling is so unpopular, we've got to oppose what they're doing, but also give an alternate plan.
[03:15:33.523 --> 03:15:36.004]  And that's what this book opens the debate about.
[03:15:36.443 --> 03:15:39.484]  It is powerful, it is riveting, it is informative.
[03:15:39.484 --> 03:15:44.003]   I have poured my heart out and the book is a lot thicker than my last book.
[03:15:44.003 --> 03:15:49.962]   It is quite the read, but it's a fast read, it's an informative read, it is a blueprint
[03:15:49.962 --> 03:15:51.243]  for victory against the globalists.
[03:15:51.243 --> 03:15:55.724]   So get your copy of The Great Awakening, The Plan to Defeat the Globalists.
