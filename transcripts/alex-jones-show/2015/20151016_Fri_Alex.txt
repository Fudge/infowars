[00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.216]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.395]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:21.857]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:23.560]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:27.806]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.387 --> 00:00:32.433]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.026 --> 00:00:36.588]  Kent Daniels wrote the story.
[00:00:36.668 --> 00:00:39.612]  It's up on Infowars.com and DrudgeReport.com.
[00:00:40.092 --> 00:00:41.754]  We covered it exclusively yesterday.
[00:00:41.955 --> 00:00:44.157]  The details, but now the article's out breaking it down.
[00:00:44.618 --> 00:00:54.209]  DOJ creates domestic terrorism division, previously labeled libertarians, conservatives as domestic terrorists, and they go on in the hour and a half video.
[00:00:55.367 --> 00:01:01.930]  That we played clips of yesterday to say the threat is the Sovereign Citizen Patriot Tea Party movement.
[00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.751]  That's the key and the story is going viral.
[00:01:05.171 --> 00:01:08.652]  We're going to add more to the story as the day unfolds.
[00:01:08.692 --> 00:01:15.375]  We're going to continue adding more research and more documentation to that article and breaking it down today.
[00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:20.017]  I mentioned the fact that the trial has been going on this week.
[00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.991]  I don't think so.
[00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:39.809]  I don't know.
[00:02:00.663 --> 00:02:06.446]  The persecution of tens of thousands of Christian groups and Tea Party groups and veterans and gun groups by the IRS.
[00:02:06.486 --> 00:02:09.007]  I mean, we know the orders went out to do this.
[00:02:10.788 --> 00:02:14.090]  So even if you could argue that maybe these people have done something,
[00:02:14.946 --> 00:02:18.708]  Maybe they had a smudge on their jacket or maybe a crooked toenail.
[00:02:19.228 --> 00:02:31.055]  You can't have the big master criminals who are above the law and run fast and furious and run import-export deals at the State Department for millions of dollars per agreement.
[00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:37.378]  I mean, it's just open and shut, completely over-the-top evil.
[00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.961]  And then you've got these people persecuting a political war.
[00:02:44.346 --> 00:02:54.633]  Prosecuting the persecution of anyone who is not an absolute anti-American globalist.
[00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:57.915]  So that's some of the news on that front.
[00:02:58.436 --> 00:03:02.579]  Huge developments obviously in the Middle East and in Europe.
[00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:03.479]  Convert or die.
[00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.521]  ISIS, graffiti, jihadists declare first European caliphate.
[00:03:07.842 --> 00:03:09.704]  Now even mainstream media reports AFP.
[00:03:11.721 --> 00:03:15.424]  That Merkel faces domestic revolt of a rescue crisis.
[00:03:16.845 --> 00:03:22.050]  Huge offensives being launched by the Russians and their coalition in Syria.
[00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.811]  We're going to go over that.
[00:03:24.152 --> 00:03:25.333]  More on what's happening in Israel.
[00:03:25.933 --> 00:03:28.796]  Terrorist disguised as journalist stabs IDF soldier.
[00:03:28.816 --> 00:03:34.401]  FBI probe of Clinton email focused on gross negligence provision.
[00:03:35.896 --> 00:03:39.879]  We're going to also get into why they're going after the polls.
[00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:59.832]  Ron Paul, greatest resistance to Federal Reserve audit, his desire to keep international activities secret, which we've now proven they rig the interest rates, they rig the currency rates, they rig the major stock market indexes and selectively give unlimited billions and overall trillions over the years to select corporations.
[00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:05.816]  It is simply so gargantuan, it is hard to fathom.
[00:04:07.057 --> 00:04:11.161]  We're also going to get into a large science stack that I have today.
[00:04:11.721 --> 00:04:14.524]  Children becoming hunchbacks due to addiction to smartphones.
[00:04:15.084 --> 00:04:17.146]  Pretty much everybody is that works at a computer.
[00:04:17.886 --> 00:04:20.869]  But children especially, they don't even really talk.
[00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.792]  And they admit the language has gotten smarter.
[00:04:23.812 --> 00:04:25.293]  I mean, it's gotten smaller.
[00:04:26.194 --> 00:04:27.355]  The opposite of smarter.
[00:04:27.795 --> 00:04:30.658]  Smartphones could be worse for your skin than the sun.
[00:04:32.296 --> 00:04:36.559]  Shock claim, world on the brink of 50 year ice age as Britain will bear the brunt.
[00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:42.063]  That all ties in with this interesting scientific news.
[00:04:42.504 --> 00:04:45.766]  Scientists claim zapping brains with magnets can treat belief in God.
[00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:47.648]  Maybe giving you a lobotomy could too.
[00:04:49.062 --> 00:04:51.244]  Did Parallel Universe open up?
[00:04:51.264 --> 00:04:53.946]  100-Sea Floating City filmed in skies above China.
[00:04:54.246 --> 00:04:55.927]  Can anybody say Project Blue Beam?
[00:04:56.267 --> 00:04:57.168]  Mass projections?
[00:04:57.208 --> 00:04:58.449]  That's what experts believe it is.
[00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:00.330]  They admit they have those programs.
[00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.291]  The Pentagon's tested them.
[00:05:01.671 --> 00:05:03.172]  It's all coming up today.
[00:05:03.272 --> 00:05:03.853]  No guests.
[00:05:04.073 --> 00:05:04.793]  Open phones.
[00:05:05.274 --> 00:05:06.855]  David Knight, of course, will be popping in.
[00:05:07.135 --> 00:05:07.956]  So stay with us.
[00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:14.791]  Villains in new Captain America comic are opponents of illegal immigration.
[00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:18.514]  Article up by Steve Watson at Infowars.com.
[00:05:18.674 --> 00:05:23.237]  Captain America started out by taking on Nazis and defending freedom.
[00:05:23.537 --> 00:05:31.142]  Now, however, Marvel has him siding with Democrats in Washington and beating up on conservatives who quote the U.S.
[00:05:31.202 --> 00:05:32.083]  Constitution.
[00:05:32.603 --> 00:05:32.923]  U.S.
[00:05:33.003 --> 00:05:36.204]  boots on the ground in Africa, article by Kurt Nimmo.
[00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:38.545]  Obama announced on Wednesday the U.S.
[00:05:38.565 --> 00:05:41.427]  will deploy troops to the African nation of Cameroon.
[00:05:41.627 --> 00:05:45.048]  Ron Paul filed a report on the deployment on Thursday.
[00:05:45.308 --> 00:05:50.170]  300 soldiers will be sent to the West African nation to conduct airborne intelligence.
[00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.875]  Surveillance and reconnaissance operations end the region, according to the BBC.
[00:05:55.015 --> 00:06:07.169]  The effort will expand the mission of AFRICOM, the Pentagon's African command, and would be part of a broader regional effort to stop the spread of Boko Haram and other violent extremist organizations in West Africa.
[00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:09.512]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:06:10.052 --> 00:06:15.497]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:06:15.797 --> 00:06:30.249]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fused it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:38.314]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:06:38.494 --> 00:06:43.937]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:06:44.077 --> 00:06:47.439]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.621]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:06:51.762 --> 00:06:55.644]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:06:56.064 --> 00:07:00.086]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[00:07:14.074 --> 00:07:15.355]  They are compounds.
[00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:15.815]  I don't know.

[00:08:21.173 --> 00:08:25.854]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.482 --> 00:08:35.924]  Here are some of the headlines on InfoWars.com.
[00:08:36.924 --> 00:08:42.869]  Merc Whistleblower warns of the internal plan for forced national inoculations.
[00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:46.911]  In studio yesterday with Rob Doo in the fourth hour.
[00:08:47.212 --> 00:08:51.615]  That's the type of breaking hardcore intel we're bringing you on a daily basis.
[00:08:52.495 --> 00:08:53.356]  Look at this headline.
[00:08:54.557 --> 00:08:59.040]  Villains in new Captain American comic are opponents of illegal immigration.
[00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:13.132]  Absolutely, what they are is they're white people, defeated by the black Captain America, because the very essence of having any border, and the existence of white people,
[00:09:15.007 --> 00:09:16.288]  is terrorism.
[00:09:17.148 --> 00:09:18.188]  And they are terrorists.
[00:09:18.469 --> 00:09:20.309]  He does take them out.
[00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:36.916]  And it's almost every cartoon, every show, they, I mean, I've tuned into a Green Lantern show that Jakari covered a few years ago, and it's tri-corner hats, and George Washington has basically come from the past and is taken out by Green Lantern.
[00:09:38.217 --> 00:09:41.338]  This is the traitorous level of who runs our country.
[00:09:43.254 --> 00:09:51.642]  Just like in Machete, Don Johnson, the white sheriff, goes around shooting pregnant Hispanic women in the stomach who beg for their lives.
[00:09:51.922 --> 00:09:55.526]  There's no known case of that on the border.
[00:09:55.886 --> 00:09:58.749]  100,000 people have been killed by the drug cartels.
[00:09:59.249 --> 00:10:04.014]  Our government shipped tens of thousands of weapons in that killed thousands, fast and furious.
[00:10:05.723 --> 00:10:13.770]  It's our criminal hijacked government killing Mexicans, along with the criminal Mexican government and Mexican army, that is the drug cartels.
[00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:23.598]  But it doesn't matter, because Marvel Comics, and we're going to go over this in a moment, when they're done, it doesn't matter.
[00:10:23.678 --> 00:10:26.921]  They even had a Marvel comic last year that was me!
[00:10:29.043 --> 00:10:31.926]  And I'm the bad racist Tea Party guy taken out.
[00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:33.452]  I just remember that.
[00:10:33.472 --> 00:10:38.637]  I mean, there are so many examples of this, it's crazy.
[00:10:38.657 --> 00:10:44.182]  And our young people just sit there believing this.
[00:10:44.202 --> 00:10:54.853]  Can you imagine being a Hispanic person, who's whether a citizen, here illegally, whatever, and you're just forced into this whole thing where you're told all the white people hate you?
[00:10:56.752 --> 00:11:14.160]  And then Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden and Obama visit you with all these Ford Foundation operatives with a straight face going, if illegals from China, from Eastern Europe, from Latin America can't come here and have their babies for free and have everything paid for, it's racist and we're sorry you're so hated.
[00:11:15.461 --> 00:11:18.823]  When Mexico has some of the most draconian borders in the world.
[00:11:19.023 --> 00:11:20.263]  I'm not even defending that.
[00:11:20.543 --> 00:11:22.204]  The point is it's just so hypocritical.
[00:11:22.504 --> 00:11:23.565]  It's so crazy.
[00:11:26.195 --> 00:11:32.761]  In fact, there's a piece that the mainstream news did on the Captain America piece that's on Infowars.com.
[00:11:32.801 --> 00:11:33.801]  Grab that video, guys.
[00:11:33.862 --> 00:11:39.827]  I want to play that at the bottom of the hour when I detail this and go over the comic itself.
[00:11:40.007 --> 00:11:40.867]  We have the comic.
[00:11:41.408 --> 00:11:45.671]  So if you're a radio listener, by tonight or tomorrow, we'll have the video up on Infowars.com.
[00:11:45.712 --> 00:11:49.915]  You can go there now and see the titles, see the video, but we'll have this live report by tomorrow.
[00:11:50.395 --> 00:11:54.259]  But if you want to watch it live, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:11:55.834 --> 00:12:15.341]  And the issue I'm getting at here is that this is a full court press, almost every drama, every cop show, every mystery show, every conspiracy show, every comic show, superhero show, that I rarely see in a hotel room on vacation.
[00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:18.442]  I'll be trying to let my kids watch television while we eat room service or something.
[00:12:18.462 --> 00:12:19.883]  I don't want them to watch a lot of TV at home.
[00:12:21.127 --> 00:12:25.790]  And I'll turn on Nickelodeon and shows for seven-year-olds, they're pushing homosexuality.
[00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:33.354]  I tuned to another channel, and sure enough, there's an evil right-wing polluter group being taken out by the leftist superheroes.
[00:12:33.815 --> 00:12:47.623]  And I tuned to the next channel, and it's just like mentally ill, short attention span brainwashing with all this flash animation moving so quick with subliminals, it's meant to rewire your kids' brains on record.
[00:12:48.564 --> 00:12:55.589]  So there's not just propaganda, there's savage brainwashing going on to rewire your children's brains.
[00:12:55.689 --> 00:13:03.374]  And by the way, remember 15 years ago, Pokemon in the United States and Japan caused tens of thousands of convulsions?
[00:13:07.037 --> 00:13:07.577]  You know why?
[00:13:07.637 --> 00:13:10.679]  Because they're able to flash a flicker rate with a television.
[00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:16.604]  It's so powerful that you actually go into convulsions.
[00:13:17.802 --> 00:13:19.102]  And children are more susceptible.
[00:13:19.342 --> 00:13:20.963]  Now that's when they turn it up too high.
[00:13:21.423 --> 00:13:24.824]  Just like when you get a bad reaction to a vaccine, it's just meant to brain damage you.
[00:13:25.844 --> 00:13:27.404]  It's just meant to lower your IQ.
[00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:31.185]  But if you have a really bad reaction, you never talk again and you're in diapers for the rest of your life.
[00:13:31.205 --> 00:13:33.045]  And it's the same thing.
[00:13:33.065 --> 00:13:40.007]  You're not meant to completely run off the, you know, fall off the balcony when you're watching TV on the porch or whatever when you watch Pokemon.
[00:13:40.047 --> 00:13:45.428]  But they tested it to such a high flicker rate that it put people into convulsions.
[00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:48.300]  By the way, you think I'm joking?
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.583]  See, there's so much intel, my brain is just burning.
[00:13:52.083 --> 00:14:01.091]  I mentioned the new Captain America who's black, who takes out racist white people who want to have a border, because the racist white people are down at the border murdering Hispanic families.
[00:14:01.992 --> 00:14:04.554]  How dare you cowards kill the innocent Hispanic women!
[00:14:05.034 --> 00:14:06.696]  I, Captain America, will now kill you!
[00:14:07.897 --> 00:14:09.758]  We support the Constitution in America!
[00:14:10.078 --> 00:14:11.640]  We are the Death Serpent!
[00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:15.728]  Remember Red Skull?
[00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:17.128]  He was Hydra with the Nazis?
[00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:25.553]  Here is Marvel Avengers.
[00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:30.176]  Here's the issue for everybody.
[00:14:30.576 --> 00:14:32.937]  This is 004 from, what, two years ago.
[00:14:33.358 --> 00:14:35.539]  Look who Red Skull has working for him!
[00:14:35.999 --> 00:14:36.860]  Alex Jones!
[00:14:37.947 --> 00:14:39.667]  That's right, I work for Red Skull.
[00:14:39.707 --> 00:14:42.268]  You didn't know I work for Red Skull?
[00:14:42.808 --> 00:14:45.489]  Against the white Captain America, who's now been killed, of course?
[00:14:47.969 --> 00:14:50.069]  And we have the black Captain America.
[00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:51.990]  It wouldn't be bad if they had a black Captain America.
[00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.530]  I don't care.
[00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:54.690]  Black Green Lantern, whatever.
[00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:58.791]  But see, it has to be a black Captain America.
[00:14:58.811 --> 00:14:59.751]  We'll put the new article up.
[00:15:01.252 --> 00:15:06.933]  Because the black Captain America takes on the all-white evil serpent group.
[00:15:09.963 --> 00:15:13.129]  And the Mexican families begged, please don't kill us, but don't worry.
[00:15:14.311 --> 00:15:16.976]  You saw Don Johnson kill that pregnant Hispanic woman.
[00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.942]  It didn't really happen, but it doesn't matter.
[00:15:21.055 --> 00:15:23.137]  You know who really is killing the pregnant women?
[00:15:23.177 --> 00:15:24.958]  They're killing their capacity to have a baby.
[00:15:25.319 --> 00:15:37.549]  It's the loving vaccines and the forced Gardasil confirmed mainstream news to be linked to autoimmune disorders, death, convulsions, and reduced fertility or sterility.
[00:15:37.869 --> 00:15:40.251]  But that's okay because La Raza
[00:15:41.443 --> 00:15:46.728]  And Mecha, for those in the race, everything, those outside the race, nothing, it's okay.
[00:15:47.348 --> 00:15:57.056]  Because the group that comes and says, we're here to protect you, we're here, we're with your race, just like a white supremacist group tells the whites in the prison, we're going to protect you.
[00:15:57.216 --> 00:16:01.420]  But really they just feed on them and use them as their muscle to carry out criminal operations.
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.763]  Just like black street gang leaders feed on their members.
[00:16:05.043 --> 00:16:05.784]  It's the same thing.
[00:16:07.418 --> 00:16:11.722]  And they'll never tell you they're killing you and laughing at you.
[00:16:12.422 --> 00:16:25.913]  Oh yes, I want to have something of a border and not pay for the whole third world to come here and be filled full of political hate towards the Republic by the giant brainwashing machine of Telemundo and Marvel and CNN and MSNBC.
[00:16:26.014 --> 00:16:29.677]  So, I'm the Red Skull in this issue!
[00:16:31.178 --> 00:16:33.560]  The Red Skull has the Tea Party working for him.
[00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:37.977]  And it's so sick.
[00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:52.445]  And they do other things that this isn't subliminal, but they have subliminals in Comedy Central, ABC News, NBC News, mainstream television shows, but also on Ron Paul, where they'll flash meth head in Ron Paul for just one tenth of a second.
[00:16:53.246 --> 00:16:59.950]  Or they'll flash for one second InfoWars saying Michael Jackson lives with aliens on a space station and Alex Jones is a kook.
[00:17:02.366 --> 00:17:05.147]  They'll just hit you, knowing your subconscious takes it in.
[00:17:05.167 --> 00:17:07.288]  We have that video up on Infowars.com.
[00:17:07.689 --> 00:17:09.890]  Hammering you and your family with hatred.
[00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.191]  Hammering you and your family with lies.
[00:17:12.571 --> 00:17:14.032]  Hammering you with disdain.
[00:17:14.372 --> 00:17:15.712]  Hammering you with fraud.
[00:17:16.333 --> 00:17:24.877]  Hammering you with Jeb Bush's operative, who's a known top operative thinking you're so dumb, with her hands on her hips going, why do you hate women, Donald Trump?
[00:17:25.757 --> 00:17:27.098]  Hammering you with fraud.
[00:17:30.475 --> 00:17:32.057]  Yeah, I'm the Red Skull now.
[00:17:32.137 --> 00:17:33.279]  I work with the Nazis.
[00:17:34.701 --> 00:17:42.351]  When again, I almost don't exist because of World War II and both my grandfathers almost died with Purple Hearts.
[00:17:46.089 --> 00:18:06.222]  Both of them almost died in the Army Air Corps, so I get to have sacks of crap like the ADL try to imply I'm a Nazi, while they defend and give their highest award to George Soros, an actual Nazi collaborator, who now backs real Nazis in Ukraine, murdering tens of thousands.
[00:18:08.644 --> 00:18:10.305]  And George Soros is back in the news.
[00:18:12.122 --> 00:18:14.627]  Saying, open up all the borders in Europe or you're racist.
[00:18:15.168 --> 00:18:19.976]  And his native country is saying, how dare you?
[00:18:21.819 --> 00:18:25.426]  This is how sick this has all gotten.
[00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:46.925]  This is how unbelievable it is, where if you're a patriot, you believe in free market, private property, family, right to defense, basic national sovereignty, you have Department of Justice creating a new anti-terror team, saying the Tea Party is going to carry out terror attacks, and they're going to federalize local police under U.N.
[00:18:47.185 --> 00:18:47.665]  treaty.
[00:18:48.186 --> 00:18:56.552]  Mainstream press release, and I get guests on here that are informed, and they can't even believe it, and tell me to my face it mustn't be true.
[00:18:58.618 --> 00:19:00.019]  That's how hardcore this is.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.400]  That's how traitorous this is.
[00:19:02.661 --> 00:19:04.482]  But if you're gonna go evil, why not go all the way?
[00:19:04.762 --> 00:19:09.085]  And that's what the criminals that have hijacked this government have done.
[00:19:10.366 --> 00:19:12.087]  Who do they say the number one terror threat is?
[00:19:12.227 --> 00:19:12.967]  Returning veterans.
[00:19:13.227 --> 00:19:14.508]  Number two, veterans.
[00:19:14.888 --> 00:19:16.189]  Number three, Christians.
[00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.890]  Number four, the Tea Party.
[00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:20.172]  And down the line,
[00:19:22.347 --> 00:19:23.968]  Every group with the lowest crime rate.
[00:19:24.589 --> 00:19:26.450]  Every group that's the most patriotic.
[00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.451]  Every group that's the hardest working.
[00:19:28.871 --> 00:19:30.272]  Every group committed to freedom.
[00:19:30.793 --> 00:19:32.454]  Every group committed to this republic.
[00:19:32.794 --> 00:19:34.375]  Demonized, lied about.
[00:19:34.695 --> 00:19:47.324]  Police departments from Indiana to Oregon to Washington State to Florida saying we have armored vehicles for the American people, for the veterans, for the constitutionalists, for the patriots.
[00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:49.365]  And after all, we know how bad they are.
[00:19:49.745 --> 00:19:52.007]  That Alex Jones works for Red Skull!
[00:19:54.209 --> 00:19:58.575]  Marvel Comics sits up there and says Alex Jones works for Red Skull!
[00:19:59.816 --> 00:20:06.023]  When they are Red Skull, George Soros is the closest thing to Red Skull I've ever seen in my life!
[00:20:07.324 --> 00:20:08.485]  What a piece of filth!
[00:20:08.925 --> 00:20:10.126]  What a piece of trash!
[00:20:10.506 --> 00:20:14.748]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[00:20:14.928 --> 00:20:18.830]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:23.212]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[00:20:26.334 --> 00:20:31.380]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:40.109]  If you want to boost your Omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.
[00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:43.273]  Nutrigold fish oils are independently 5-star certified.
[00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:43.713]  I think so.
[00:21:10.567 --> 00:21:15.169]  A revolution in body protection has arrived, only at FortressSurvivalLLC.com.

[00:21:40.148 --> 00:21:48.114]  There are hundreds of silver products on the market today, but there's nothing like the astonishing health benefits of the multi-patented One Silver Solution.

[00:22:12.432 --> 00:22:13.152]  Another shooting.
[00:22:13.552 --> 00:22:14.773]  And they're getting worse.
[00:22:15.253 --> 00:22:18.475]  That's why Infidel Body Armor introduces Infidel Fridays.

[00:24:11.744 --> 00:24:16.868]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:17.568 --> 00:24:19.890]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:27.035]  There is a war on for your mind and in the next segment I'm going to go over Captain America in their new official big rollout.
[00:24:27.075 --> 00:24:30.478]  The black Captain America battles pretty much exclusively white people.
[00:24:32.339 --> 00:24:37.643]  And white people that talk about the Bill of Rights and Constitution are hardcore murdering racists that want to kill Hispanics.
[00:24:38.063 --> 00:24:39.945]  But of course Captain America comes and saves them.
[00:24:42.694 --> 00:24:45.035]  This is incredibly dangerous, folks.
[00:24:46.055 --> 00:24:54.077]  This is the weaponization of media, this is the same Soros Combine that's funding this clash of civilizations, this attack on local police.
[00:24:54.097 --> 00:24:59.418]  And I've got a stack of police doing horrible things here today, and they're all being indicted.
[00:25:02.099 --> 00:25:02.439]  One of them
[00:25:03.618 --> 00:25:05.760]  has been put on leave and needs to be indicted, in my view.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:15.568]  And there's certainly bad things going on with the police, but this entire class of civilizations is about getting us all to fight with each other, obviously, while the globalists take over civilization.
[00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:23.595]  Look at how they'll fund right-wing Nazis against the Russians, or they'll fund radical Islamists against Shiites.
[00:25:24.395 --> 00:25:32.342]  They are just launching wars, launching criminal operations, aggressing against people that have done nothing.
[00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:37.631]  And then imploding our borders all over the world.
[00:25:38.911 --> 00:25:46.133]  Rich nations are being told, you will pay for the third world after the globalists bring those countries down.
[00:25:46.253 --> 00:25:47.673]  It is a premeditated plan.
[00:25:50.813 --> 00:25:52.994]  And look at these articles today that ties into all this.
[00:25:53.474 --> 00:26:00.495]  Here's the real world that if you talk about it, Marvel says you're with Red Skull and puts you in the comic book.
[00:26:01.476 --> 00:26:03.096]  Imagine receiving that.
[00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:13.136]  Imagine being put in a comic book that millions of young people read, where you want to kill Mexicans.
[00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:21.183]  Imagine how diabolical that is, and how cunning that is.
[00:26:24.365 --> 00:26:30.510]  Convert or die, ISIS graffiti jihadists declare first European caliphate, Daily Star.
[00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:32.492]  The terror group's logo was dubbed
[00:26:34.113 --> 00:26:37.614]  On the wall of a restaurant in Gothenburg, Sweden, chilling message.
[00:26:37.754 --> 00:26:42.676]  And all over Sweden, all over Germany, folks with burning torches, pipes, knives are marching.
[00:26:42.696 --> 00:26:43.516]  The police will do nothing.
[00:26:43.876 --> 00:26:45.497]  The caliphate is here, it reported.
[00:26:47.618 --> 00:26:52.680]  Military-age men pose on their Facebooks, recruiting women, saying, look at me with my weapons.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.140]  This is who's coming in.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:59.042]  ISIS said six, seven months ago, we're going to flood Europe with a refugee crisis of young men.
[00:26:59.282 --> 00:27:00.102]  We're taking over.
[00:27:00.442 --> 00:27:01.803]  And Merkel opens the door.
[00:27:02.791 --> 00:27:05.632]  Merkel faces domestic revolt over refugee welcome.
[00:27:05.972 --> 00:27:19.077]  Yahoo News, AFP, Germany's Angela Merkel is used to owning the room when she speaks to her party faithful, but the mood turned hostile when she defended her open-door refugee policy this week.
[00:27:19.717 --> 00:27:22.098]  We had an article on Infowars.com yesterday.
[00:27:22.318 --> 00:27:26.499]  Not one, but two German cities, towns.
[00:27:26.579 --> 00:27:29.760]  In one, they're bringing in 4,000 refugees into a town of 3,000.
[00:27:32.762 --> 00:27:36.224]  And they're saying, you will pay for it in local taxes, the governor said.
[00:27:36.504 --> 00:27:39.406]  And when they said, we don't like it, the governor said, get out of here then.
[00:27:39.726 --> 00:27:40.206]  Leave!
[00:27:42.427 --> 00:27:43.488]  And the people said, are you kidding?
[00:27:43.888 --> 00:27:45.469]  And the governor said, I'm not kidding.
[00:27:45.689 --> 00:27:46.489]  Get out of here.
[00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:48.871]  This is a conquering.
[00:27:49.611 --> 00:27:50.451]  This is a breaking.
[00:27:51.312 --> 00:27:52.472]  Your children belong to us.
[00:27:52.793 --> 00:27:54.994]  We'll arrest you if you criticize the open borders.
[00:27:55.574 --> 00:27:57.015]  We're reactivating Stasi.
[00:27:58.407 --> 00:28:01.290]  You cannot describe the criminal energy we're facing.
[00:28:01.911 --> 00:28:12.861]  Savage, focused, global, evil, exempt from taxes, exempt diplomatically, above the law, with bodyguards, disarming everyone else.
[00:28:13.382 --> 00:28:15.104]  Savage, craven, hateful.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:28.196]  In the heated atmosphere, some of the 1,000-odd members of the meeting warned of a national disaster and demanded shuttering borders as Germany expects up to a million migrants this year.
[00:28:28.236 --> 00:28:29.097]  It's actually four million.
[00:28:30.219 --> 00:28:31.381]  Stop the refugee chaos.
[00:28:31.421 --> 00:28:32.282]  Save the German culture.
[00:28:32.503 --> 00:28:32.983]  Values.
[00:28:35.745 --> 00:28:40.450]  Dethroned Merkel read a banner in the Congress late Wednesday in the eastern state of Saxony.
[00:28:41.211 --> 00:28:41.992]  And it just goes on.
[00:28:42.553 --> 00:28:43.934]  Islam was never part of Europe.
[00:28:44.214 --> 00:28:45.376]  Hungary's Orban.
[00:28:45.396 --> 00:28:47.778]  The point is, Islam tried to invade Europe eight different times.
[00:28:48.219 --> 00:28:50.481]  Then the Crusades, counter-offensive.
[00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:52.303]  And I'm not even anti-Islamic, folks.
[00:28:52.504 --> 00:28:57.169]  But radical Islam is being funded by the West to bring us down.
[00:28:58.527 --> 00:29:03.371]  You think Cloward and Piven's the only professor group that says we want to bankrupt everybody to make them dependent?
[00:29:04.332 --> 00:29:07.995]  There's always been a leftist, socialist, radical Islamic combo.
[00:29:08.635 --> 00:29:10.617]  The old Soviet Union funded radical Islam.
[00:29:10.977 --> 00:29:13.459]  Then it got taken over by the West after the fall of the Soviet Union.
[00:29:15.841 --> 00:29:16.541]  And it goes on.
[00:29:16.601 --> 00:29:19.003]  And now Russia's in the position on the other side.
[00:29:20.044 --> 00:29:26.850]  Meanwhile, billionaire Soros, this is the London Guardian, billionaire Soros comes under fire in the homeland.
[00:29:28.496 --> 00:29:31.838]  Hedge fund mogul George Soros has come under fire in his native Hungary.
[00:29:32.538 --> 00:29:33.799]  It's also CNBC News.
[00:29:34.479 --> 00:29:40.242]  Where politicians have accused him of supporting illegal migration amidst a refugee crisis that brought the right-wing government under pressure.
[00:29:41.482 --> 00:29:42.423]  Accusing him?
[00:29:42.923 --> 00:29:48.405]  Soros and his different societies are the ones that are coaching the team.
[00:29:49.226 --> 00:29:51.487]  And they've got their little quarterbacks out there running the ball.
[00:29:52.187 --> 00:29:55.829]  We're gonna be back on the other side to go over this.
[00:29:58.058 --> 00:29:59.021]  It's just simply amazing.
[00:29:59.542 --> 00:30:02.549]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.472 --> 00:30:06.158]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:12.712]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:30:12.972 --> 00:30:18.095]  Ammo control picks up stream among Democrats aiming to limit gun access.
[00:30:18.355 --> 00:30:20.436]  Article up at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:20.577 --> 00:30:35.206]  With 300 million firearms in circulation and calls for more restrictions hitting a wall, Democrats and gun control advocates from California to Virginia are increasingly turning to other proposals such as restricting ammunition,
[00:30:35.506 --> 00:30:40.588]  Why is it that we have background checks for guns but not background checks for ammunition?
[00:30:40.608 --> 00:30:43.810]  It makes no sense, Mr. Newsom said at his press conference.
[00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.091]  Well, because it's ammunition, you ass clown!
[00:31:05.359 --> 00:31:08.365]  You can find more articles like this at InfoWars.com
[00:31:10.069 --> 00:31:10.629]  I want more candy!

[00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:12.190]  Mine!
[00:31:12.551 --> 00:31:13.391]  Mine!
[00:31:40.069 --> 00:31:40.469]  I think so.
[00:32:09.953 --> 00:32:19.858]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high-quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at htfirearms.com.

[00:33:13.771 --> 00:33:16.454]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:33:16.514 --> 00:33:17.454]  We think, just let me think.
[00:33:17.494 --> 00:33:23.359]  I suspect even now orders are being shouts into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:33:23.499 --> 00:33:25.040]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:25.341]  Damn it!
[00:33:25.381 --> 00:33:25.701]  Why?
[00:33:26.442 --> 00:33:32.426]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:33:33.027 --> 00:33:36.409]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the
[00:33:38.982 --> 00:33:43.785]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:33:43.805 --> 00:33:44.766]  You designed it, sir.
[00:33:44.846 --> 00:33:45.767]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:33:45.787 --> 00:33:47.167]  You told me every television in London!
[00:33:47.428 --> 00:33:49.509]  Cruelty and injustice.
[00:33:49.529 --> 00:33:50.910]  Intolerance and oppression.
[00:33:51.330 --> 00:34:00.936]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and subverting your submission.
[00:34:00.956 --> 00:34:01.156]  Cameras.
[00:34:01.196 --> 00:34:01.876]  We need cameras.
[00:34:02.176 --> 00:34:02.917]  How did this happen?
[00:34:03.617 --> 00:34:04.378]  Who's to blame?
[00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:08.014]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:34:08.034 --> 00:34:09.936]  They will be held accountable.
[00:34:09.956 --> 00:34:15.824]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:34:17.023 --> 00:34:18.764]  I know why you did it.
[00:34:19.004 --> 00:34:20.085]  I know you were afraid.
[00:34:20.105 --> 00:34:22.226]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:34:22.246 --> 00:34:22.306]  War?
[00:34:22.506 --> 00:34:22.886]  Terror?
[00:34:23.126 --> 00:34:23.786]  Disease?
[00:34:24.447 --> 00:34:30.289]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:32.310]  Fear got the best of you.
[00:34:32.691 --> 00:34:37.213]  And in your panic, you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:34:37.273 --> 00:34:38.333]  He promised you order.
[00:34:38.373 --> 00:34:39.374]  He promised you peace.
[00:34:39.874 --> 00:34:43.416]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:34:46.601 --> 00:34:47.461]  There is a war.
[00:34:48.502 --> 00:34:49.462]  It's happening now.
[00:34:50.502 --> 00:34:52.263]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:34:53.183 --> 00:34:54.803]  We are the response to that tyranny.
[00:34:55.304 --> 00:34:56.224]  We are the Info War.
[00:34:56.244 --> 00:34:57.924]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:34:58.685 --> 00:35:00.165]  We are the resistance.
[00:35:00.565 --> 00:35:02.166]  We are the Info War.
[00:35:02.346 --> 00:35:04.286]  Ha ha ha!
[00:35:04.826 --> 00:35:08.407]  Yeah, they don't know what to do when I start repeating my own voice-overs on air.
[00:35:08.447 --> 00:35:10.428]  They fade it down, then fade it back up.
[00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:16.213]  You know, I'm sitting there watching that little promo intro that we've had for a few years, V for Vendetta.
[00:35:17.173 --> 00:35:20.175]  We're making a new one right now that's really powerful to be ready next week.
[00:35:22.337 --> 00:35:25.299]  And I was just thinking about truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.361]  A lot of art imitates life.
[00:35:28.461 --> 00:35:33.184]  The Wachowski brothers admit that's what that film is about, where they see America and England going.
[00:35:35.806 --> 00:35:38.588]  And we're really now getting to that point.
[00:35:41.001 --> 00:36:05.967]  We're now coming to the point of where we live in a true high-tech brainwashing grid where almost every TV show, movie, news article is written as a conscious deception to skew reality.
[00:36:08.683 --> 00:36:11.585]  Remember how they said that Obamacare was going to be free at first?
[00:36:12.106 --> 00:36:13.867]  Then it was going to cut your price in half.
[00:36:13.987 --> 00:36:16.349]  Then it was going to let you keep your doctor.
[00:36:16.369 --> 00:36:18.851]  And there were no death panels.
[00:36:19.651 --> 00:36:21.132]  There was no rationing of care.
[00:36:22.053 --> 00:36:32.001]  And one month after it passed, Newsweek, Time, the White House, all of them came out and said, guess what, there really are death panels.
[00:36:32.381 --> 00:36:33.282]  Bill Gates said it too.
[00:36:33.302 --> 00:36:37.405]  They had the cover of Newsweek, the case for killing grannies.
[00:36:41.041 --> 00:36:46.886]  And it was just so funny to them to rub it in our face and now they have the don't treat list for the veterans.
[00:36:51.149 --> 00:36:57.174]  And they just sit there in our face rubbing it in.
[00:36:58.835 --> 00:36:59.475]  Dominating.
[00:37:00.596 --> 00:37:06.221]  Setting the precedent with mass Stockholm Syndrome and learned helplessness.
[00:37:09.329 --> 00:37:17.553]  To fatigue the public spiritually, physically, psychologically into a broke-back submission.
[00:37:19.795 --> 00:37:20.955]  They're breaking our will.
[00:37:21.976 --> 00:37:23.397]  They're destroying our will to fight.
[00:37:25.258 --> 00:37:30.681]  Well, my will to fight against these monsters has never been stronger.
[00:37:32.802 --> 00:37:38.165]  And a lot of people have gone from the point of disbelief to awakening to despair
[00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:46.936]  To gutting up to realize we are against abject conscious criminals.
[00:37:48.837 --> 00:38:00.326]  The most important thing we can do is understand no amount of extreme rhetoric can even get near how bad these people are.
[00:38:01.564 --> 00:38:04.345]  And that their greatest strength is also their greatest weakness.
[00:38:05.886 --> 00:38:23.834]  That they are so completely and totally over-the-top oppressive, so completely deceptive, so completely criminal and hateful of real freedom.
[00:38:24.514 --> 00:38:28.376]  And their will to conquer and dominate us is so
[00:38:30.538 --> 00:38:39.040]  Crazed, so rabies-like, that a lot of people just can't believe it's actually happening or they're intimidated by it and just tune out.
[00:38:40.981 --> 00:38:49.943]  But it doesn't matter if 50-60% of people just decide to drool and get in a fetal position and urinate on themselves, crying for mommy, sucking their thumb.
[00:38:50.844 --> 00:38:54.625]  A large animated minority, a good 20% now,
[00:38:59.384 --> 00:39:10.368]  is really coming to grips with the fact that we are in the hands, we are in the clutches, we are in the talons of people that aren't going to give us quarter.
[00:39:11.488 --> 00:39:12.408]  We have no hope.
[00:39:13.269 --> 00:39:14.309]  We have no future.
[00:39:14.729 --> 00:39:16.930]  There's nothing left to do now but stand up against them.
[00:39:18.598 --> 00:39:43.246]  And you need to let Marvel Comics and Hollywood and Disney, the parent company, and all these big globalist operations know that you're fully aware of what savage social engineers they are, and how much hate they have for this country, and how they've conquered this nation, and that they plan on gutting what's left of it, and turning us into third world slaves.
[00:39:44.892 --> 00:39:51.375]  You see, the people that run America took the treasure and the power of this republic and used it to pretty much take over the world.
[00:39:52.856 --> 00:39:54.717]  They're now trying to mop up the planet.
[00:39:55.638 --> 00:40:00.120]  Hollywood isn't even really totally focused on domestic now, it's mainly focused international.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:06.403]  You go see any blockbuster, it's a bunch of world government, pro-communist China bilge.
[00:40:07.984 --> 00:40:11.566]  These are absolutely
[00:40:13.357 --> 00:40:18.819]  Reprobate, anathema, soulless, heartless mercenaries.
[00:40:22.081 --> 00:40:24.982]  At CNN and MSNBC.
[00:40:28.844 --> 00:40:30.824]  I was watching Fox News yesterday.
[00:40:32.025 --> 00:40:39.368]  Shepard Smith, a clip on Infowars.com, dealing with Cuban troops now in Syria.
[00:40:44.352 --> 00:41:02.968]  And he was just up there over and over again using brainwashing terms to say that Russia was helping ISIS and that Russia had basically started everything and that Russia was bad.
[00:41:07.025 --> 00:41:08.546]  Well, Russia didn't start the fight.
[00:41:09.306 --> 00:41:11.587]  Russia has two international military bases, not 400.
[00:41:13.168 --> 00:41:15.008]  Russia doesn't put fluoride in their water.
[00:41:15.389 --> 00:41:16.969]  Russia doesn't force inoculate.
[00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:19.030]  Russia isn't trying to take my guns.
[00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:22.332]  Russia isn't saying the Founding Fathers are bad Marvel comics.
[00:41:24.953 --> 00:41:34.937]  As bad as Russia is, compared to the absolute traitorous... Russia's trying to stop the massive radical Islamic flow into Europe.
[00:41:38.993 --> 00:41:43.154]  Russia's openly saying George Soros wants to destroy America and Europe.
[00:41:44.314 --> 00:41:51.396]  Russia has openly banned more than seven groups George Soros funds in Russia who he admits is there to overthrow the government.
[00:41:52.896 --> 00:41:59.218]  I mean how bizarre is that that a weirdo Nazi collaborator who's almost 90 years old
[00:42:00.336 --> 00:42:14.030]  Runs MSNBC, The Huffington Post, Media Matters, and scores of other organizations, and all they do all day is attack Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, World Net Daily, Free Speech, Talk Radio, and the Russian government.
[00:42:18.034 --> 00:42:21.518]  And now George Soros, of course, from a year ago, we have this flashback I'm going to play in a moment.
[00:42:22.479 --> 00:42:23.180]  That's our next clip.
[00:42:24.321 --> 00:42:25.882]  Singh, don't underestimate Russia.
[00:42:25.962 --> 00:42:27.423]  Of course don't underestimate Russia.
[00:42:27.643 --> 00:42:42.754]  When you encircle it with radical Jihad forces from Chechnya to Ukraine and start blowing up and attacking police and military bases, the same thing they're trying to get going here against police departments, recruiting centers and military bases.
[00:42:44.206 --> 00:42:55.892]  We've got hard core revolutionaries in control of the government who want a revolution against your church, want a revolution over your family, want a revolution over your bank account.
[00:42:58.049 --> 00:43:00.831]  They want to dominate you and break you.
[00:43:01.132 --> 00:43:01.612]  You understand?
[00:43:02.132 --> 00:43:07.137]  Like most rapists don't rape women because they want the pleasure of having sex with a woman.
[00:43:07.737 --> 00:43:14.222]  They do it because they like to break their nose, break their collarbone, break their cheekbone, and rape them and hurt them.
[00:43:15.904 --> 00:43:18.606]  That's the nature of hardcore wicked evil people.
[00:43:18.906 --> 00:43:23.570]  They want to get you in a FEMA camp and break your jaw with billy clubs.
[00:43:24.611 --> 00:43:26.813]  They want to burn your house down with you in it.
[00:43:28.268 --> 00:43:31.330]  They want to break your will and have your children.
[00:43:31.571 --> 00:43:32.231]  You understand that?
[00:43:32.551 --> 00:43:33.312]  And they're coming.
[00:43:33.812 --> 00:43:34.853]  And they mean business.
[00:43:35.934 --> 00:43:39.897]  And you notice I'm taking the gloves off of these people because this is the reality.
[00:43:40.317 --> 00:43:44.761]  They flooded Europe with 5 million radical Islamics the last year and a half.
[00:43:47.283 --> 00:43:55.529]  And they tell the Germans, you're going to come and compulsory volunteer, and you're going to clean their dorms, and you're going to make their beds while they sit there and spit on you.
[00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:57.751]  But we fool them full of leftist hatred.
[00:43:59.022 --> 00:44:00.643]  And you're not going to have Oktoberfest.
[00:44:01.164 --> 00:44:02.645]  And you're not going to wear short skirts.
[00:44:04.867 --> 00:44:06.268]  You're going to do what we say.
[00:44:06.348 --> 00:44:09.051]  You understand, or you get out of here!
[00:44:10.552 --> 00:44:13.675]  You know, you're pro-life, you're pro-gun, get out of New York!
[00:44:15.276 --> 00:44:18.319]  You don't want totally open borders and to pay for the whole world to come here?
[00:44:18.339 --> 00:44:21.281]  We're going to put you in a comic book as a terrorist!
[00:44:21.842 --> 00:44:24.384]  We're going to have a black Captain America kill you!
[00:44:27.981 --> 00:44:28.822]  How sick is that?
[00:44:29.322 --> 00:44:31.163]  While they give blacks double unemployment?
[00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:39.749]  When they know full well in every study, fluoride is two to three times worse, depending on the disease, for Africans.
[00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:46.053]  I mean, fluoride is a death sentence long-term for any human, but you give it to black people.
[00:44:46.474 --> 00:44:47.374]  You like heart attacks?
[00:44:47.714 --> 00:44:48.695]  You like hypertension?
[00:44:48.895 --> 00:44:49.956]  You like high blood pressure?
[00:44:50.116 --> 00:44:51.137]  You like bone cancer?
[00:44:51.317 --> 00:44:52.678]  You like testicular cancer?
[00:44:52.938 --> 00:44:53.999]  You like liver cancer?
[00:44:54.299 --> 00:44:57.041]  Baby, fluoride to black people's a death sentence.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:01.840]  Look it up.
[00:45:02.021 --> 00:45:02.641]  Just type in.
[00:45:02.882 --> 00:45:04.823]  Fluoride causes more harm to blacks.
[00:45:06.665 --> 00:45:07.406]  But don't worry.
[00:45:07.666 --> 00:45:11.530]  Captain America likes you is going to teach you to get the whitey.
[00:45:12.371 --> 00:45:17.796]  The poor, pathetic white down the road that's in the exact same globalist position you're in under attack.
[00:45:18.957 --> 00:45:21.179]  That's all they got is dividing us against each other.
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.442]  It's sick and it's filthy.
[00:45:23.642 --> 00:45:24.543]  Here's George Soros.
[00:45:25.666 --> 00:45:33.567]  I'm talking about, for instance, the threat posed by Russia, a resurgent Russia.
[00:45:35.008 --> 00:45:44.549]  The European public and apparently many of the leaders are not sufficiently aware of that danger.
[00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:54.151]  And Europe doesn't behave like an association of countries that is under attack.
[00:45:55.571 --> 00:46:13.445]  So that's one of the major uncertainties and it's really up to the international authorities to provide Ukraine the financial support that it needs in order to stand up
[00:46:14.065 --> 00:46:26.037]  To an actual military and financial assault, which is an assault on the very foundations of the values that the European Union is based on.
[00:46:26.677 --> 00:46:30.401]  So that's one very important thing we should talk more about.
[00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:37.308]  Russia in 1991 turned off its air defenses and stopped doing patrols outside the country.
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:45.683]  NATO responded by moving heavy weapons and nuclear weapons up to the border of Russia, and by sending in color revolution teams to bring Russia down.
[00:46:47.763 --> 00:47:00.008]  But George Soros gets up there, and he fought against Russia when he was a young man, for the Nazis, in police and secret police activities.
[00:47:02.029 --> 00:47:08.051]  And now we have to sit here and look at him and lie, and say that Russia is attacking Europe.
[00:47:09.684 --> 00:47:16.808]  But he's now under fire in his own homeland, because people see right through it.
[00:47:17.308 --> 00:47:26.173]  Hedge fund mogul Soros has come under fire in his native Hungary, where politicians have accused him of supporting illegal migration amidst a refugee crisis that brought the right-wing government under pressure.
[00:47:27.694 --> 00:47:29.074]  Because that's mainly where folks are pouring in.
[00:47:29.134 --> 00:47:32.336]  It's Hungary and Romania by the millions, and things are just collapsing.
[00:47:32.756 --> 00:47:35.278]  And Europe just says, take them, that's the way it is, ha ha ha.
[00:47:35.578 --> 00:47:37.399]  Then they call them racist because they don't want to.
[00:47:42.625 --> 00:47:56.010]  Now, earlier I showed you the Avengers from about a year and a half ago, where they've got me in there with Red Skull, where Red Skull runs the Tea Party to attack the peaceful immigrants, but Thor comes with Captain America and defeats the white people.
[00:47:56.990 --> 00:48:04.293]  But it's not good to have white people, white Captain America, and a white Thor defeating the evil white people.
[00:48:04.333 --> 00:48:07.775]  You've got to have a black Captain America to get the race war really going.
[00:48:07.815 --> 00:48:10.936]  He attacks a Tea Party group who's killing Mexicans on the border.
[00:48:11.937 --> 00:48:23.079]  And you can actually see the article with the comic up on Infowars.com and it's... How dare you attack women and children because they're Hispanic?
[00:48:23.239 --> 00:48:23.719]  Shut up!
[00:48:23.819 --> 00:48:26.199]  We're doing the Lord's work and the Constitution.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:27.800]  You will meet the serpent.
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.340]  But then Captain America comes down and takes them out.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.601]  Let's scroll through it so folks can see it.
[00:48:36.061 --> 00:48:38.281]  Captain America is going to stand up against this Tea Party.
[00:48:38.862 --> 00:48:39.922]  Don't you ever worry.
[00:48:39.942 --> 00:48:39.982]  So...
[00:48:42.438 --> 00:48:48.364]  Let's go ahead now and go to this piece, breaking it down, and then I'm gonna go more over the propaganda.
[00:48:48.384 --> 00:48:49.565]  This is just one small sampling.
[00:48:49.605 --> 00:48:49.945]  Here it is.
[00:48:50.826 --> 00:49:03.298]  Not something McIver News typically covers, but Marvel Comics released the first issue of its new Captain America series on Wednesday, and Marvel decided to make some strong ideological statements on some hot political topics.
[00:49:03.959 --> 00:49:06.702]  The new villains in this comic are conservatives,
[00:49:07.102 --> 00:49:11.306]  Who are portrayed as a right-wing terrorist group called the Sons of the Serpent.
[00:49:11.907 --> 00:49:21.456]  They stop a group of immigrants trying to cross the border who they accuse of invading a sovereign land to spread disease and crime, take American jobs, and collect welfare.
[00:49:21.936 --> 00:49:23.978]  Then Captain America comes and beats them up.
[00:49:24.739 --> 00:49:32.401]  Those in the country who disagree with Captain America's new partisan agenda accuse him of being anti-American, against the Constitution.
[00:49:32.801 --> 00:49:35.061]  They even call him Captain Socialism.
[00:49:35.521 --> 00:49:38.622]  He says all he wanted to do was to bring folks together.
[00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:39.222]  Oh, yeah.
[00:49:39.262 --> 00:49:43.443]  Marvel Comics is owned by Disney, who also owns ABC and ESPN.
[00:49:43.843 --> 00:49:52.025]  The company is currently in the middle of reinventing itself, hoping to attract younger readers while capitalizing on the success of its movies.
[00:49:52.905 --> 00:49:59.627]  That's a good report by those folks, but this is unified.
[00:49:59.727 --> 00:50:00.788]  This isn't just Disney.
[00:50:00.868 --> 00:50:05.469]  It's all of the big six media companies owned and run by the big five banks.
[00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:08.750]  It's Fox Television Entertainment.
[00:50:09.171 --> 00:50:10.011]  It's full of all this.
[00:50:11.611 --> 00:50:21.995]  This is a total agenda in your face to demonize anyone that dares
[00:50:24.335 --> 00:50:24.695]  I think so.
[00:50:44.781 --> 00:50:45.682]  Remember what it said?
[00:50:46.422 --> 00:50:51.344]  Right at double the taxes on the third world under carbon taxes that the first world's gonna pay.
[00:50:51.985 --> 00:50:55.126]  It's really a death sentence for the third world.
[00:50:55.647 --> 00:50:58.728]  For Africa, for the Middle East, for poorer areas of Asia.
[00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:01.270]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:06.512]  Because the average person gets their news from comic books and Marvel TV shows and movies.
[00:51:07.773 --> 00:51:09.554]  I see full-grown men who believe this is real.
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.882]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:51:13.182 --> 00:51:15.784]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:51:15.824 --> 00:51:16.244]  Croix River.
[00:51:16.565 --> 00:51:18.566]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:51:18.786 --> 00:51:21.508]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:51:21.748 --> 00:51:22.269]  His excuse?
[00:51:22.629 --> 00:51:23.710]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:25.251]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:51:25.571 --> 00:51:31.075]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[00:51:31.335 --> 00:51:32.076]  Don't wait.
[00:51:32.376 --> 00:51:34.737]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now.

[00:51:40.034 --> 00:51:41.875]  Who's among the worst at keeping your data private?
[00:51:42.016 --> 00:51:45.498]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy Report says it's AT&T.
[00:51:45.758 --> 00:51:51.823]  AT&T customers need to know this when calling the Alex Jones 24-7 listen line at 1-605-562-9000.
[00:51:52.003 --> 00:51:53.004]  Big Brother is listening.

[00:51:57.427 --> 00:52:01.650]  Call the Alex Jones 24-7 listen line on any phone, but please don't use AT&T.
[00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:04.412]  For everyone else, bookmark Alex Jones listen line number today.
[00:52:04.432 --> 00:52:04.492]  1-605-562-9000.
[00:52:04.732 --> 00:52:04.953]  That's 1-605-562-9000.
[00:52:09.756 --> 00:52:14.618]  Turn on the news and you'll hear stories of natural disasters, political unrest, and financial crisis.
[00:52:14.938 --> 00:52:18.640]  In times of uncertainty, how will you take care of your family's most basic needs?

[00:53:02.362 --> 00:53:03.262]  Enhancing health and privacy.
[00:53:09.326 --> 00:53:15.669]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:20.992]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[00:53:21.533 --> 00:53:25.535]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about.
[00:53:26.075 --> 00:53:29.917]  This change has deep implications for life in America.
[00:53:30.357 --> 00:53:34.620]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit and the family you want to protect,
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.942]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:53:38.322 --> 00:53:40.543]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[00:53:41.284 --> 00:53:45.226]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[00:53:45.687 --> 00:53:46.187]  They did.
[00:53:46.787 --> 00:53:51.210]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:52.331]  They did.
[00:53:53.011 --> 00:53:56.293]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:53:56.853 --> 00:53:58.855]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:53:59.235 --> 00:54:00.396]  This will affect us all.
[00:54:00.736 --> 00:54:02.637]  You can watch the video for free right now.
[00:54:02.737 --> 00:54:25.863]  Remember, almost two weeks ago, the TPP was ratified globally by multinational corporations and foreign governments.
[00:54:28.383 --> 00:54:30.244]  Still, Congress has not been given
[00:54:31.224 --> 00:54:36.288]  itself, that final treaty, and the American people, the enemy, are not allowed to see it.
[00:54:36.329 --> 00:54:45.016]  The communist Chinese are, Monsanto is, Microsoft is, Apple is, but that's okay because Apple has Al Gore on its board.
[00:54:46.677 --> 00:54:52.583]  So it's okay they have Foxconn factories with suicide nets, forced drugging, forced abortion on record.
[00:54:53.603 --> 00:54:58.468]  The daycare system for these major companies is chaining toddlers to light poles.
[00:55:00.336 --> 00:55:03.197]  Where they eat one meal a day and defecate on the side of the road.
[00:55:04.898 --> 00:55:09.300]  If your child plays in the backyard, they're taken at 5 o'clock at age 11.
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:16.223]  Age 11, your child plays till 6 in the backyard, your child will be taken, that's a true story.
[00:55:18.104 --> 00:55:20.445]  In China, suicide nets, children are chained.
[00:55:21.673 --> 00:55:24.214]  How are we going to compete with suicide nets and chain children?
[00:55:24.834 --> 00:55:30.737]  You see, these are hardcore, ultra-wicked people that run Apple, that run these major companies.
[00:55:31.357 --> 00:55:34.058]  They are so sinister, it is unspeakable.
[00:55:34.098 --> 00:55:37.339]  They are in a war against you and your family.
[00:55:37.459 --> 00:55:40.841]  I just cannot repeat this to you enough how much they hate you.
[00:55:42.421 --> 00:55:44.002]  They've gotten everybody else's guns.
[00:55:44.422 --> 00:55:46.243]  They've gotten everybody else's private property.
[00:55:47.113 --> 00:55:48.973]  They haven't totally bankrupted Europe yet.
[00:55:48.993 --> 00:55:51.714]  That's why they're going to flood them with tens of millions of radical Islamics.
[00:55:52.194 --> 00:55:53.394]  Everyone's going to have to bow.
[00:55:53.734 --> 00:55:57.495]  You will be arrested if you even speak out by the totalitarians.
[00:55:57.575 --> 00:56:00.116]  I mean, they are hard core.
[00:56:00.876 --> 00:56:03.736]  You fly a rebel flag, you're going to be charged with terrorism.
[00:56:04.677 --> 00:56:06.037]  People say, good, I don't like a rebel flag.
[00:56:06.457 --> 00:56:07.637]  Next, it's going to be your speech.
[00:56:10.558 --> 00:56:12.318]  And you notice it's all just accelerating.
[00:56:12.378 --> 00:56:13.918]  It's all just getting worse by the day.
[00:56:14.199 --> 00:56:15.199]  They're getting more naked.
[00:56:15.219 --> 00:56:16.199]  They're getting more open.
[00:56:19.494 --> 00:56:22.556]  CNN comes out and says we should ban the word he and she.
[00:56:22.836 --> 00:56:24.057]  We should shame everyone.
[00:56:24.417 --> 00:56:25.898]  Even having a sex is evil.
[00:56:25.918 --> 00:56:28.239]  Do you understand how Jim Jones that is?
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:32.302]  I mean, that is just hardcore cult brainwashing.
[00:56:33.422 --> 00:56:34.843]  No identity is allowed.
[00:56:35.624 --> 00:56:43.889]  You must be a blank slate with open eyes that follows whatever programming you're given on a daily basis.
[00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:48.804]  People say, well it's crazy, no one will put up with this.
[00:56:49.225 --> 00:56:51.326]  No, they've got a lot of the young people.
[00:56:52.547 --> 00:56:57.590]  Young people are either incredibly awake, or they are cult members now.
[00:57:01.313 --> 00:57:07.017]  Now, I'm going to start the next hour, I'm going to do a bunch of news I haven't even covered yet, but this is hardcore.
[00:57:08.112 --> 00:57:09.032]  It really is hardcore.
[00:57:09.052 --> 00:57:09.973]  There's just so much.
[00:57:10.013 --> 00:57:11.313]  This is a huge news day.
[00:57:11.873 --> 00:57:18.655]  Then I'm going to open the phones up, and we're going to be taking a lot of your phone calls today at 800-259-9231.
[00:57:20.435 --> 00:57:27.497]  We are running some specials that end next week that help fund our operation, but also get you really great products, the lowest prices you're going to find them.
[00:57:28.177 --> 00:57:33.519]  The ProPure G2 filters and other systems we have are 10% off and free shipping.
[00:57:34.673 --> 00:57:41.058]  That is a massive discount, a massive special, free shipping, and 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:57:42.259 --> 00:57:45.202]  We also have 20% off Secret 12 Mythical Bottlement.
[00:57:45.642 --> 00:57:50.166]  Super Mel Vitality is also now back in stock, finally, after a few months.
[00:57:51.387 --> 00:57:54.490]  Expanding on that, probably the biggest special we have.
[00:57:56.551 --> 00:58:06.313]  is free shipping and 10% off on InfoWars Select, MyPatriot Supply Food, the full spectrum of their highest quality food, the best storable food out there in my view.
[00:58:06.713 --> 00:58:12.574]  InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:12.594 --> 00:58:21.916]  And in the face of this tyranny, we're getting more reporters, more camera people, more investigative journalists to cover more, to get in the face of the system more.
[00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:24.090]  Doing our part.
[00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:27.451]  Upping our game against the globalists in the face of their counter-offensive.
[00:58:28.091 --> 00:58:28.811]  We're on the march.
[00:58:29.252 --> 00:58:30.612]  The empire is on the run.
[00:58:31.312 --> 00:58:33.773]  Infowarslife.com for the nutraceuticals.
[00:58:34.313 --> 00:58:37.194]  Infowarsstore.com for the t-shirts.
[00:58:37.234 --> 00:58:38.094]  The Hillary for prison.
[00:58:38.254 --> 00:58:38.574]  All of it.
[00:58:38.954 --> 00:58:39.995]  We're in a culture war.
[00:58:40.535 --> 00:58:42.175]  By the way, we're bringing down McDonald's.
[00:58:42.615 --> 00:58:44.056]  We're bringing down Monsanto.
[00:58:44.816 --> 00:58:46.456]  If we start now, it may take a decade.
[00:58:46.676 --> 00:58:48.057]  We can destroy Disney.
[00:58:48.177 --> 00:58:49.157]  We must do it.
[00:58:49.197 --> 00:58:49.917]  They're the enemy.
[00:58:50.317 --> 00:58:51.358]  No one support Disney. 100%.
[00:58:53.258 --> 00:58:54.658]  Absolute boycott!
[00:58:54.698 --> 00:58:55.659]  They are the enemy.
[00:58:55.759 --> 00:58:56.659]  Spread the word.
[00:58:56.719 --> 00:58:57.699]  They hate America.
[00:58:57.819 --> 00:58:58.619]  They hate Christians.
[00:58:58.639 --> 00:58:59.560]  They hate your family.
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:04.261]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[00:59:04.461 --> 00:59:08.662]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[00:59:08.702 --> 00:59:16.004]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[00:59:16.164 --> 00:59:26.687]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[00:59:26.847 --> 00:59:30.168]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[00:59:30.348 --> 00:59:31.368]  What do you have to lose?
[00:59:31.488 --> 00:59:34.189]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and
[00:59:34.329 --> 00:59:39.793]  You're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[00:59:39.933 --> 00:59:43.076]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[00:59:43.236 --> 00:59:47.259]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[00:59:47.419 --> 00:59:49.561]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[00:59:49.741 --> 00:59:56.707]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:00:02.708 --> 01:00:07.151]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:14.075 --> 01:00:15.856]  Jakari Jackson cut this parallel.
[01:00:16.176 --> 01:00:17.416]  Big Brother.
[01:00:17.496 --> 01:00:18.297]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:18.317 --> 01:00:19.197]  To Captain America.
[01:00:19.277 --> 01:00:19.978]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:19.998 --> 01:00:21.659]  And what's really happening in our world today.
[01:00:22.594 --> 01:00:23.474]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.494 --> 01:00:26.776]  He's Alex... We are facing weaponized media.
[01:00:26.796 --> 01:00:27.876]  It's becoming more naked.
[01:00:27.896 --> 01:00:30.697]  They've legalized CIA operations in the media.
[01:00:31.018 --> 01:00:32.418]  We are the organic response.
[01:00:32.838 --> 01:00:34.199]  We have the secret weapon, the truth.
[01:00:34.639 --> 01:00:36.060]  And here is Jackson's breakdown.
[01:00:39.561 --> 01:00:43.983]  Do you want to kill Nazis?
[01:00:44.043 --> 01:00:46.284]  I don't want to kill anyone.
[01:00:49.741 --> 01:00:50.481]  I don't like bullies.
[01:00:51.402 --> 01:00:52.262]  I don't care where they're from.
[01:00:52.862 --> 01:00:59.205]  I believe Captain America was a composite character that really kind of captured the essence of that generation.
[01:00:59.545 --> 01:01:15.112]  There's another analogy to be taken from Captain America and that is that that generation and America in general has essentially fallen asleep like Captain America did as you see him wake up in the second Captain America movie to find that he's living in an authoritarian police state.
[01:01:15.512 --> 01:01:22.976]  For a second day in a row, a group of World War II vets literally took down a barrier blocking off the World War II memorial in Washington, D.C.
[01:01:22.996 --> 01:01:26.518]  There he leaves his barricades back!
[01:01:26.538 --> 01:01:29.800]  Wow, you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing.
[01:01:30.501 --> 01:01:30.761]  Wow.
[01:01:31.181 --> 01:01:36.524]  I go protect Iraqis in Iraq, and I come back and I find that my fellow Americans are being attacked by police.
[01:01:41.833 --> 01:01:46.057]  For once, we're way ahead of the curve.
[01:01:46.097 --> 01:01:50.541]  By holding a gun to everyone on earth and calling it protection.
[01:01:50.981 --> 01:01:59.029]  The police and National Guard going street by street, house to house, and instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:03.105]  We're gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen.
[01:02:03.125 --> 01:02:04.606]  The punishment usually came after the crime.
[01:02:04.886 --> 01:02:08.469]  And when they say, I want my lawyer, you tell them, shut up!
[01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:09.449]  Your time has expired.
[01:02:09.469 --> 01:02:10.130]  Get a lawyer.
[01:02:10.690 --> 01:02:11.751]  You're an enemy combatant.
[01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:13.769]  You guys did some nasty stuff.
[01:02:14.449 --> 01:02:14.689]  Yeah.
[01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:16.411]  We compromised.
[01:02:16.591 --> 01:02:18.412]  Sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well.
[01:02:18.612 --> 01:02:30.280]  When I was in Afghanistan, they usually kept us outside these buildings and the other government agency guys, probably like DEA, CIA and all that, they would go into these kind of rooms like that, exactly, and they would be torturing people from in there.
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.442]  Horrible scream to hear a grown person like that being tortured.
[01:02:33.582 --> 01:02:36.083]  You're watching as this opium is being grown.
[01:02:36.123 --> 01:02:40.186]  We provide them security, we're providing them resources, and we're providing them alternatives.
[01:02:40.686 --> 01:02:41.427]  Captain America,
[01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:43.168]  He's a fugitive from S.H.I.E.L.D.
[01:02:43.988 --> 01:02:45.269]  With all due respect, if S.H.I.E.L.D.
[01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:47.890]  is conducting a manhunt for Captain America, we deserve to know why.
[01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:56.174]  You have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[01:02:56.234 --> 01:02:58.154]  This is only going to get worse once it starts.
[01:02:58.295 --> 01:03:00.856]  And again, there's no veterans doing anything right now.
[01:03:01.456 --> 01:03:02.336]  No IEDs.
[01:03:02.456 --> 01:03:05.678]  They are literally getting the police to pick a fight with veterans.
[01:03:06.482 --> 01:03:10.163]  You are standing in my brain.
[01:03:10.263 --> 01:03:10.903]  How did you get here?
[01:03:11.323 --> 01:03:12.044]  Infighted.
[01:03:12.144 --> 01:03:15.965]  It was Operation Paperclip after World War II, S.H.I.E.L.D.
[01:03:16.005 --> 01:03:19.165]  recruited German scientists with strategic values.
[01:03:19.205 --> 01:03:20.886]  Thought I could help their cause.
[01:03:21.306 --> 01:03:32.249]  Operation Paperclip explores the secret military program that hired scientists who used slave labor to build the V2 rocket and others who used concentration camp victims for human experiments.
[01:03:32.529 --> 01:03:50.013]  The responsibility for the staggering loss of life and property is uniformly placed on Hitler and the Nazis, but excluded from the official history is the fact that Hitler and the National Socialists would not have risen to power without the help of international bankers and American and German corporations.
[01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:54.314]  She's disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets onto the internet.
[01:03:54.334 --> 01:03:55.394]  Including Hydra's.
[01:03:55.554 --> 01:03:56.014]  And S.H.I.E.L.D.'
[01:03:55.994 --> 01:03:56.034]  's.
[01:03:56.574 --> 01:04:01.377]  What about Bradley Manning?
[01:04:01.457 --> 01:04:02.818]  What about Bradley Manning?
[01:04:02.998 --> 01:04:07.962]  I think the revelations are terrible because they were revealed.
[01:04:08.442 --> 01:04:09.563]  What's his name?
[01:04:09.583 --> 01:04:10.544]  Snowden.
[01:04:11.164 --> 01:04:12.625]  Yes, Snowden.
[01:04:12.885 --> 01:04:13.726]  I think he's a traitor.
[01:04:14.446 --> 01:04:15.107]  What about the others?
[01:04:15.727 --> 01:04:17.028]  Are you planning a rescue mission?
[01:04:17.309 --> 01:04:24.154]  You think about what is going on with the Veterans Administration Hospital and the fact that we have veterans that are dying because they're on a wait list.
[01:04:24.475 --> 01:04:25.476]  You talk about Sgt.
[01:04:25.496 --> 01:04:27.277]  Tamarisi and his situation.
[01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:38.687]  Something that I've been upset about and raised a cane about, so I'm going to ask you about it.
[01:04:39.506 --> 01:04:47.194]  And that's this right-wing extremism report that was mailed out to all law enforcement officials in the United States.
[01:04:47.554 --> 01:04:49.816]  I've apologized for that report.
[01:04:49.856 --> 01:04:52.179]  It was not authorized to be distributed.
[01:04:52.219 --> 01:04:53.500]  This isn't freedom.
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:54.041]  This is fear.
[01:04:54.521 --> 01:04:54.841]  S.H.I.E.L.D.
[01:04:54.901 --> 01:04:57.604]  takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be.
[01:04:57.724 --> 01:05:01.488]  It's getting damn near past time for you to get with that program, Captain.
[01:05:04.533 --> 01:05:08.997]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:05:09.537 --> 01:05:10.278]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:05:10.318 --> 01:05:14.781]  Villains in new Captain America comic are opponents of illegal immigration.
[01:05:15.022 --> 01:05:18.504]  Article up by Steve Watson at Infowars.com.
[01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:23.228]  Captain America started out by taking on Nazis and defending freedom.
[01:05:23.508 --> 01:05:31.094]  Now, however, Marvel has him siding with Democrats in Washington and beating up on conservatives who quote the U.S.
[01:05:31.174 --> 01:05:32.075]  Constitution.
[01:05:32.575 --> 01:05:32.896]  U.S.
[01:05:32.976 --> 01:05:36.179]  boots on the ground in Africa, article by Kurt Nimmo.
[01:05:36.519 --> 01:05:38.521]  Obama announced on Wednesday the U.S.
[01:05:38.541 --> 01:05:41.404]  will deploy troops to the African nation of Cameroon.
[01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:45.028]  Ron Paul filed a report on the deployment on Thursday.
[01:05:45.288 --> 01:05:50.153]  300 soldiers will be sent to the West African nation to conduct airborne intelligence.
[01:05:50.393 --> 01:05:54.857]  Surveillance and reconnaissance operations end the region, according to the BBC.
[01:05:54.978 --> 01:06:07.129]  The effort will expand the mission of AFRICOM, the Pentagon's African command, and would be part of a broader regional effort to stop the spread of Boko Haram and other violent extremist organizations in West Africa.
[01:06:07.229 --> 01:06:09.472]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.

[01:07:08.353 --> 01:07:13.096]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[01:07:13.376 --> 01:07:18.640]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:26.866]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[01:07:27.326 --> 01:07:33.010]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:42.136]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:07:42.556 --> 01:07:48.378]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[01:07:48.778 --> 01:07:55.179]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:00.641]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[01:08:00.881 --> 01:08:03.021]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:03.362 --> 01:08:05.382]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:08:12.583 --> 01:08:14.804]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:18.206]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.748 --> 01:08:27.890]  We have seen unprecedented persecution of whistleblowers and the press.
[01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:39.856]  We have seen the IRS memos come out publicly that they are targeting Christians, conservatives, Republicans, libertarians, veterans organizations.
[01:08:41.092 --> 01:08:46.336]  We have seen them commit Fast and Furious, Benghazi, openly fund Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[01:08:46.976 --> 01:08:51.379]  We have seen them launch proxy wars against Russia in Syria and Ukraine.
[01:08:52.841 --> 01:09:02.788]  We have seen them continue to debase the dollar and sign us bipartisanly on to the economy-killing mass screwjob that is Obamacare and the banker bailouts.
[01:09:04.798 --> 01:09:23.524]  And now we see such intensification of programming in comedies and movies and cop shows and superhero programs where the founding fathers are bad, Christians are bad, gun owners are bad, white people are inherently evil.
[01:09:25.885 --> 01:09:29.086]  This is all a bunch of old white executives pushing this.
[01:09:29.846 --> 01:09:32.927]  This is total divide and conquer to get us fighting with each other.
[01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:35.496]  While the globalists rob us blind.
[01:09:36.097 --> 01:09:47.680]  The former chief economist of the World Bank, I'm going to play this clip in a moment, Joseph Stiklitz, who's won two Nobel Prizes, one for economics and the other, I believe, was for peace.
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:48.740]  It was a joint one.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:50.821]  He's been on the show many times.
[01:09:50.841 --> 01:09:52.221]  We ought to work on getting him back on.
[01:09:53.582 --> 01:09:57.483]  And he was there in 2002 when he resigned, then a bunch of documents got leaked.
[01:09:57.523 --> 01:09:58.363]  He says he didn't do it.
[01:09:59.462 --> 01:10:05.168]  Where they plan to implode the West next, with too big to fail programs signing us onto derivatives.
[01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:09.253]  Starting with Europe, and then the United States.
[01:10:11.275 --> 01:10:13.017]  And they call it the IMF riot.
[01:10:13.097 --> 01:10:17.302]  They stir up society, they stir up cultures, they destabilize the civilization.
[01:10:18.524 --> 01:10:23.227]  Then they pose as saviors to take even more rights during the emergency that could last years.
[01:10:23.727 --> 01:10:39.437]  The value of the currency, the value of infrastructure, the value of companies goes down, the multinationals come in and buy it up for pennies on the dollar, and the multilateral systems the multinationals have set up are tax-exempt.
[01:10:41.078 --> 01:10:47.322]  IBM, Microsoft, Apple, General Electric,
[01:10:48.470 --> 01:11:15.689]  Google, General Motors, the Fortune 100, and it goes up into the 200s, but the Fortune 100 across the board, take 90% of their profits offshore and never pay tax, and have written the international law where if somebody tries to put $2 million in a Swiss bank account, their life savings, they claim it's illegal and take your money, even if it's after tax.
[01:11:16.903 --> 01:11:19.786]  You try to put your money in the Grand Caymans, they come after you.
[01:11:19.806 --> 01:11:20.566]  If it's $500,000.
[01:11:21.968 --> 01:11:25.371]  But if it's $10-20 billion, you are untouchable.
[01:11:27.833 --> 01:11:33.338]  And they pass the laws where their yachts are tax-exempt, while they raise the taxes on the Greek people.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.541]  They know what they're doing.
[01:11:39.068 --> 01:11:42.549]  And then how do they stop the people from getting wise to the screw job?
[01:11:42.789 --> 01:11:47.630]  How they raise taxes on us to give themselves the corporate welfare and the banker bailout.
[01:11:49.010 --> 01:12:07.234]  They have Disney, they have News Corp, they have Time Warner, and two other companies teach pedophilia on television, teach the end of the family that he and she is hateful, that boy and girl is hateful, and that all white people are racist,
[01:12:09.502 --> 01:12:12.564]  And that not doing what you're told is sexist.
[01:12:14.846 --> 01:12:22.571]  MTV yesterday, we had the report said, not agreeing with a woman's selfie, not saying you like it, is sexist.
[01:12:23.412 --> 01:12:24.913]  You go, that just sounds silly, it sounds stupid.
[01:12:25.433 --> 01:12:26.354]  Absolutely, it's meant to.
[01:12:26.434 --> 01:12:27.515]  It dumbs the culture down.
[01:12:27.775 --> 01:12:34.660]  Where young people don't know about the seven continents, they don't know about the North and South Pole, the Arctic, Antarctic, they don't know about
[01:12:35.936 --> 01:12:36.777]  They don't know about fission fusion.
[01:12:36.797 --> 01:12:39.198]  They don't know about Hadron Collider, cyclotrons.
[01:12:39.479 --> 01:12:41.300]  They don't know about quantum mechanics, physics.
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:44.722]  They don't know about literature, Beethoven.
[01:12:44.983 --> 01:12:53.429]  All they know how to do is run around and freak out with their weird, arrogant identity that they're good and you're bad because they're a liberal trendy.
[01:12:54.069 --> 01:13:01.395]  When they are in a true, classical, by every benchmark, serious cult.
[01:13:03.117 --> 01:13:05.780]  That is about only using approved language.
[01:13:07.142 --> 01:13:10.605]  Having a very small repertoire of friends.
[01:13:12.087 --> 01:13:13.729]  Not being able to publicly speak.
[01:13:16.412 --> 01:13:18.875]  Just put your hands on your hip and feel incensed.
[01:13:21.684 --> 01:13:22.664]  This is unbelievable.
[01:13:23.085 --> 01:13:29.768]  Let's go ahead and go to this Joseph Stiklitz clip, where he just came out yesterday and said, the multinationals must pay taxes.
[01:13:30.148 --> 01:13:33.069]  They cannot squeeze any more money out of poor people in the middle class.
[01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:35.590]  And the multinationals are unified.
[01:13:36.011 --> 01:13:37.471]  They're the ones that want your guns.
[01:13:37.831 --> 01:13:40.753]  They're the ones that have the unified staging of the interest rates.
[01:13:41.813 --> 01:13:43.314]  Staging of the currency rates.
[01:13:43.774 --> 01:13:46.315]  Staging of the stock markets.
[01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:49.657]  Look, I'd tell you this 20 years ago, it's all admitted now.
[01:13:50.999 --> 01:13:52.600]  Secret treaties we can't see.
[01:13:54.101 --> 01:13:55.182]  It's incredible!
[01:13:56.063 --> 01:13:59.385]  We're not being conquered by the Redcoats in the War of 1812.
[01:14:00.926 --> 01:14:03.267]  We're not being conquered by the Nazis or the Soviets.
[01:14:03.668 --> 01:14:09.051]  We've been conquered by white-collar criminals that are Bernie Madoff to the power of infinity.
[01:14:13.995 --> 01:14:19.739]  George Soros talks about raising taxes on rich people while he lobbies worldwide to be exempt.
[01:14:20.663 --> 01:14:22.124]  Warren Buffett, same deal.
[01:14:22.144 --> 01:14:38.860]  And I know I harp on this, but anytime I turn on Disney-run television, ABC, all I hear is, Warren Buffett loves you, and his secretary pays a higher tax rate than he does, and he doesn't like it.
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:44.005]  That's why he's lobbying for this new tax incentive, Obama, that'll raise taxes on rich people.
[01:14:45.089 --> 01:14:51.693]  It raises taxes on people that made over $100,000 up to $4 million and then it starts going down.
[01:14:54.215 --> 01:14:57.137]  And then he's got a multinational system set up.
[01:14:57.897 --> 01:14:59.578]  But he knows you're ignorant.
[01:15:00.539 --> 01:15:03.541]  Don Johnson didn't shoot a pregnant woman on the border.
[01:15:04.461 --> 01:15:06.382]  The Mexican cartels torture him to death.
[01:15:07.843 --> 01:15:10.025]  Evil cartels do it.
[01:15:11.078 --> 01:15:22.169]  It doesn't matter, because Machete, funded by the White House, and I have that inside intel, it's now come out, by the government, says there are white people down there shooting Mexican women in the stomach to create racial hatred.
[01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:34.581]  And now, I covered a lot in the last hour, Marvel Comics, up on InfoWars.com, openly saying
[01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:42.953]  That Captain America, the black Captain America, is taking out the evil white people that are down there attacking the poor immigrants.
[01:15:43.213 --> 01:15:56.458]  The same stupid script that they hand TV producers, comic book designers, the same mindless script over and over again, hammering fraud, hammering lies, hammering brainwashing.
[01:15:57.018 --> 01:15:57.758]  It's so sick.
[01:15:58.138 --> 01:16:02.440]  That's their plan to keep us fighting with each other while they start World War III.
[01:16:04.394 --> 01:16:13.876]  Well, they let Monsanto, it's now come out in the new treaty, the sections that were leaked last week by WikiLeaks, that your country won't be able to stop GMO, you'll be forced to eat it.
[01:16:14.996 --> 01:16:17.697]  You have no sovereignty if they're able to ram this through.
[01:16:18.717 --> 01:16:22.958]  And because it's so evil, your government, your Congress isn't allowed to see it.
[01:16:24.539 --> 01:16:26.419]  Because we're in a world government.
[01:16:28.379 --> 01:16:30.960]  Let's go ahead and go to this Stiglitz clip.
[01:16:33.052 --> 01:16:38.393]  We want the multilateral corporations to pay their fair share of taxes.
[01:16:38.473 --> 01:16:39.233]  It's really that simple.
[01:16:39.273 --> 01:16:42.974]  But you can't blame them for taking advantage of a system that's in their favor.
[01:16:43.514 --> 01:16:45.815]  Absolutely, but they helped create this system.
[01:16:46.255 --> 01:16:54.077]  And the exciting thing that's going on right now is the G20 realized, the advanced countries realized, that something was wrong.
[01:16:54.857 --> 01:17:00.940]  Apple, Google, Starbucks were able to move their profits around and then pay almost no taxes.
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:06.623]  You have Apple, the largest corporation by capitalization in the world, paying almost no taxes.
[01:17:07.004 --> 01:17:11.406]  And so the question is, something's wrong with the system and that's what we're focusing on.
[01:17:11.606 --> 01:17:22.552]  But repairing that system is very difficult because you have got the Goliath and the David, you have got this wall of money, and you have an enormous vested interest by these companies.
[01:17:23.530 --> 01:17:24.490]  To prevent you from doing it.
[01:17:25.090 --> 01:17:25.451]  That's right.
[01:17:25.511 --> 01:17:39.754]  Now, the good news is that OECD has this process called BEPS, Base Erosion, where they're trying to figure out how can we deal with the base erosion, the disappearing of the tax base.
[01:17:40.134 --> 01:17:42.175]  And they've actually come up with some very good ideas.
[01:17:43.275 --> 01:17:49.438]  Our commission argues that it hasn't gone far enough, and particularly with respect to the developing countries.
[01:17:49.779 --> 01:17:54.701]  The problem is we told the developing countries, open up your markets to the multinationals.
[01:17:55.482 --> 01:17:57.342]  They've already stolen all the wealth.
[01:17:57.363 --> 01:18:00.104]  They've already bankrupted all the countries and the individuals by design.
[01:18:00.124 --> 01:18:05.107]  They've already signed every American at the day they're born onto millions, over a million dollars in fake debt.
[01:18:06.187 --> 01:18:09.109]  So now they're going to talk about, oh, the eroding tax base.
[01:18:10.091 --> 01:18:11.192]  It's so terrible.
[01:18:11.912 --> 01:18:22.638]  I don't think Stickles is a bad guy himself, but then they have these little commissions that'll call for taxing corporations, but then they don't even tax the big ones, they tax the middle size ones.
[01:18:23.058 --> 01:18:27.621]  It's all selective to, again, consolidate power, consolidate wealth.
[01:18:28.861 --> 01:18:29.622]  So when you see
[01:18:31.095 --> 01:18:41.182]  All this race division, all this kill the cops stuff, all this socialist redistribution propaganda from Bernie Sanders, you don't hear him saying, audit the Fed, he killed that.
[01:18:43.223 --> 01:18:47.206]  You hear him talking about Walmart and individuals that are worth $40 billion apiece.
[01:18:47.626 --> 01:18:49.447]  And I agree, they did it through game in the system.
[01:18:49.807 --> 01:18:51.108]  I don't think Walmart was free market.
[01:18:53.690 --> 01:18:57.813]  But you notice the CNN idiot goes, but you can't blame them for
[01:18:58.891 --> 01:19:01.352]  For using the system, they are the system.
[01:19:02.553 --> 01:19:03.393]  They set it up.
[01:19:05.134 --> 01:19:17.960]  And Walmart was allowed to operate like this to consolidate the supply chain to a few globalist corporations to make sure that only select companies can make the big profits long-term off Chinese slave goods.
[01:19:19.681 --> 01:19:22.903]  That's why Apple is such a big supporter of the Communist government of China.
[01:19:23.343 --> 01:19:27.285]  Because they run factories where people are treated
[01:19:29.108 --> 01:19:32.190]  Worse than many slaves were treated in this country long term.
[01:19:33.111 --> 01:19:37.354]  I mean, it's some of the most hellish conditions, but it's not called slavery because it's trendy.
[01:19:37.674 --> 01:19:39.395]  Communists cannot engage in slavery.
[01:19:39.435 --> 01:19:40.416]  They engage in love.
[01:19:40.956 --> 01:19:45.559]  They engage in when they take your organs or force labor you to death or suicide you.
[01:19:45.999 --> 01:19:50.863]  It is a sacrament of friendly trendiness when they work your fingers to bleeding bones.
[01:19:52.588 --> 01:20:04.769]  Because, I mean, Apple's Steve Jobs, I mean, Apple's little trendies wearing little white t-shirts going, non-threatening, non-threatening, with huge black ops squads with a total plan to take over and end total freedom as we know it.
[01:20:05.876 --> 01:20:06.136]  Okay!
[01:20:06.537 --> 01:20:09.739]  They're savage, they hate you, they're in control, they're coming.

[01:21:09.744 --> 01:21:16.085]  My name is Bill Bonner and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[01:21:16.465 --> 01:21:21.406]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[01:21:21.946 --> 01:21:25.947]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about.
[01:21:26.487 --> 01:21:30.328]  This change has deep implications for life in America.
[01:21:30.768 --> 01:21:35.029]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[01:21:35.609 --> 01:21:38.370]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:40.971]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[01:21:41.691 --> 01:21:45.632]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[01:21:46.112 --> 01:21:46.612]  They did.
[01:21:47.212 --> 01:21:51.634]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:52.734]  They did.
[01:21:53.414 --> 01:21:56.695]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[01:21:57.275 --> 01:21:59.276]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[01:21:59.636 --> 01:22:00.816]  This will affect us all.
[01:22:01.156 --> 01:22:03.097]  You can watch the video for free right now.
[01:22:04.557 --> 01:22:12.920]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:14.200]  It's true.
[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:18.241]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:18.441 --> 01:22:20.302]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:20.842 --> 01:22:25.303]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:25.623 --> 01:22:38.228]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[01:23:48.557 --> 01:23:54.762]  Most other RFID wallets on the market were designed with only fashion in mind and do not shield properly, if at all.
[01:23:55.223 --> 01:24:01.188]  When you're shopping for your next wallet, be sure to get the protection you deserve by going to IDStronghold.com.
[01:24:01.628 --> 01:24:05.891]  Because getting anything else is like using latex gloves as oven mitts.
[01:24:07.792 --> 01:24:08.052]  Ouch!
[01:24:14.697 --> 01:24:19.139]  By the way, I literally have over a hundred articles that are all incredibly important.
[01:24:19.159 --> 01:24:24.043]  I've got loaded phones and I'm just kind of screaming, they hate you, they hate your family, they hate your freedom.
[01:24:24.923 --> 01:24:30.647]  You know, Bush would say Al Qaeda attacked us because they hate our freedoms, while Bush and the Democrats with him were taking our freedoms.
[01:24:32.771 --> 01:24:36.432]  But in truth, the globalists do hate sovereign, independent individuals.
[01:24:38.352 --> 01:24:39.332]  They want to conquer us.
[01:24:39.412 --> 01:24:40.633]  That's their will to power.
[01:24:41.853 --> 01:24:46.514]  And I'm just like Paul Revere up here, just screaming, the globalists are coming, the globalists are coming.
[01:24:47.594 --> 01:24:49.954]  To arms, to arms, in the info war.
[01:24:51.774 --> 01:24:58.756]  Because they are activating national police forces, UN run, with the Justice Department to go after the Tea Party.
[01:24:59.116 --> 01:25:00.416]  They're already persecuting us.
[01:25:02.349 --> 01:25:05.771]  The entire Justice Department that's been involved, the IRS should be in prison?
[01:25:06.291 --> 01:25:11.113]  Nixon was removed from office for doing one one-millionth, and I'm serious.
[01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:16.956]  He didn't even act on IRS persecution, he just had list and was entertaining it.
[01:25:18.056 --> 01:25:22.218]  And they just do it at MSNBC comes out and goes, I've got Rachel Maddow on tape.
[01:25:22.758 --> 01:25:25.739]  Of course we're going after the Tea Party, they're racist!
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:28.601]  Of course the IRS is going after you!
[01:25:30.663 --> 01:25:34.424]  I mean, they're just, of course we're gonna arrest you for a rebel flag!
[01:25:36.464 --> 01:25:38.684]  I mean, man, these people are dangerous!
[01:25:40.705 --> 01:25:42.405]  And I've never flown a rebel flag!
[01:25:44.286 --> 01:25:49.106]  If they can arrest you for a rebel flag, they can arrest you for anything, people!
[01:25:49.526 --> 01:25:52.547]  This is beyond Soviet Union!
[01:25:53.867 --> 01:25:57.308]  They are arresting Germans by the hundreds!
[01:25:58.917 --> 01:26:12.570]  If they even criticize open borders and people being raped, the trash of the Middle East, their young military-age men, criminals, are organizing and pouring into Europe.
[01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:14.932]  Sweden set up an airline to fly them in.
[01:26:15.392 --> 01:26:18.755]  Germans in towns of 3,000 have 4,000 illegals delivered.
[01:26:19.216 --> 01:26:21.618]  They go to a city council and say, why are you doing this?
[01:26:21.958 --> 01:26:24.561]  And the governor says, leave!
[01:26:29.906 --> 01:26:31.787]  This is military!
[01:26:32.988 --> 01:26:34.449]  This is a takeover!
[01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:38.992]  And the poor Latin Americans pouring in are just pawns.
[01:26:41.453 --> 01:26:44.695]  They are not as criminal statistically as what's coming out of the Middle East and Europe.
[01:26:46.196 --> 01:26:50.259]  The difference is people do flee Latin America to come here and to have fake names.
[01:26:50.359 --> 01:26:53.060]  We are the Mexico of Latin America.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:57.063]  It's like Americans run to Mexico because of no extradition?
[01:26:58.851 --> 01:27:00.712]  Criminals worldwide run here.
[01:27:02.633 --> 01:27:10.776]  And if you state that, well, you get put in Marvel Comics, like I did, as a racist that wants to kill immigrants.
[01:27:11.736 --> 01:27:12.657]  Remember a year and a half ago?
[01:27:14.357 --> 01:27:18.679]  Avengers 004 AR joined the revolution.
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:25.402]  And then now they've got the new Captain America part of the Avengers fighting Red Skull.
[01:27:25.762 --> 01:27:27.443]  And who was Red Skull's main lieutenant?
[01:27:27.963 --> 01:27:28.383]  It's me.
[01:27:31.519 --> 01:27:32.460]  I can actually find it here.
[01:27:33.761 --> 01:27:34.662]  That's how they do it.
[01:27:35.162 --> 01:27:36.083]  That's what they do.
[01:27:36.383 --> 01:27:39.025]  Do you understand the level of that propaganda?
[01:27:41.207 --> 01:27:43.789]  Rob Jacobson ran in here and he said, you don't know about the new Superman?
[01:27:43.809 --> 01:27:45.811]  So I've got one of the reporters doing an article on it.
[01:27:46.091 --> 01:27:46.712]  And I said, no.
[01:27:46.732 --> 01:27:48.293]  He goes, well, the new ad started two days ago.
[01:27:48.994 --> 01:27:51.075]  It's all how Superman's an illegal alien.
[01:27:51.676 --> 01:27:57.821]  And again, folks, it's that it's every show, every program, unified propaganda.
[01:27:57.881 --> 01:27:59.763]  In fact, we have the trailer of that.
[01:28:01.650 --> 01:28:06.215]  They want Superman out because he's an illegal alien.
[01:28:07.316 --> 01:28:08.537]  Aliens are un-American.
[01:28:08.978 --> 01:28:11.100]  This is the ridiculousness.
[01:28:12.281 --> 01:28:14.984]  I saw an article on CNN yesterday, I'm going to bring it in.
[01:28:16.846 --> 01:28:19.649]  Is it ethical for humans to colonize Mars?
[01:28:21.158 --> 01:28:25.881]  And they basically say, even if there aren't life forms or advanced ones, aren't we kind of a scourge?
[01:28:26.522 --> 01:28:28.523]  Do we have a right to colonize Mars?
[01:28:28.923 --> 01:28:31.585]  Again, it's the unified that we're trash!
[01:28:32.105 --> 01:28:34.527]  They're saying we're the alien on Earth!
[01:28:34.867 --> 01:28:36.849]  The globalists want to get rid of us!
[01:28:38.209 --> 01:28:42.372]  Hispanic, black, white, Asian, humans, humans, mixed, whatever!
[01:28:43.473 --> 01:28:45.034]  Humans are all mixing together!
[01:28:45.234 --> 01:28:46.675]  Humans are all coming together!
[01:28:46.895 --> 01:28:49.177]  We don't need to be told how we're racist all day!
[01:28:49.377 --> 01:28:50.698]  That's to make us hate each other!
[01:28:51.886 --> 01:28:52.506]  There's the article.
[01:28:52.566 --> 01:28:53.947]  Is it ethical to colonize Mars?
[01:28:54.247 --> 01:28:55.408]  The world after humans.
[01:28:55.648 --> 01:28:56.589]  Humans a disease.
[01:28:56.809 --> 01:28:57.769]  Humans a parasite.
[01:28:57.809 --> 01:28:58.550]  Humans a cancer.
[01:28:58.570 --> 01:28:59.050]  You've heard it!
[01:28:59.330 --> 01:29:16.059]  They tell you how they hate you all day, how they hate me all day, how they hate our babies all day, and then they sit there and go, but we love all the immigrants and anyone that doesn't want an open border, and the Border Patrol shipping people in and completing the smuggling process.
[01:29:16.299 --> 01:29:17.300]  It's just outrageous.
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.821]  So, you know, I'm going to do this next week.
[01:29:20.384 --> 01:29:21.986]  Buckley shot a day after two.
[01:29:23.228 --> 01:29:23.769]  I'm going.
[01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:25.551]  In the evening.
[01:29:26.553 --> 01:29:30.976]  Five o'clock, six o'clock, and I'm going to meet people in a middle-class neighborhood.
[01:29:30.996 --> 01:29:43.304]  I'm going to go to Tarrytown, a liberal area, and I'm going to knock on 50 doors with a handout, and I'm going to say with a camera, I don't care what they do, hi, I'm a migrant, and I'm going to start trying to push my way in, saying I want dinner, I want you to give me money.
[01:29:43.664 --> 01:29:44.504]  I'm not going to threaten them.
[01:29:45.145 --> 01:29:46.806]  When they say no, I'm going to go, what do you mean?
[01:29:47.126 --> 01:29:49.487]  Give me your money, I'm a migrant, racist!
[01:29:50.448 --> 01:29:51.309]  I'm going to do it!
[01:29:52.304 --> 01:29:53.986]  Because it's total mind control!
[01:29:54.247 --> 01:29:55.048]  It's crazy!
[01:29:55.869 --> 01:29:59.533]  I can't go to Guatemala and show up and demand free stuff!
[01:29:59.553 --> 01:30:00.414]  This is brainwashing!
[01:30:10.319 --> 01:30:12.660]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:18.023]  Ammo control picks up stream among Democrats aiming to limit gun access.
[01:30:18.283 --> 01:30:20.384]  Article up at InfoWars.com.
[01:30:20.504 --> 01:30:39.134]  With 300 million firearms in circulation and calls for more restrictions hitting a wall, Democrats and gun control advocates from California to Virginia are increasingly turning to other proposals such as restricting ammunition, magazine rounds, and narrowing the ability to wield weapons.
[01:30:39.514 --> 01:30:53.597]  California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, who is running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 2018, released a statewide ballot campaign Thursday to require background checks for ammunition purchases.
[01:30:53.957 --> 01:30:58.858]  Why is it that we have background checks for guns, but not background checks for ammunition?
[01:30:58.998 --> 01:31:02.119]  It makes no sense, Mr. Newsom said at his press conference.
[01:31:02.299 --> 01:31:04.899]  Well, because it's ammunition, you a** clown!
[01:31:05.299 --> 01:31:08.320]  You can find more articles like this at InfoWars.com.
[01:31:10.083 --> 01:31:13.185]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:13.506 --> 01:31:21.511]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:21.752 --> 01:31:26.775]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:31:27.176 --> 01:31:29.457]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:31:48.139 --> 01:31:51.300]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:54.622]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:31:54.922 --> 01:31:56.663]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:31:56.903 --> 01:31:57.784]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:31:57.804 --> 01:31:58.744]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:31:58.984 --> 01:32:00.806]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:32:27.103 --> 01:32:28.663]  The globalists want us dependent.
[01:32:28.823 --> 01:32:30.324]  We need to be self-sufficient.
[01:32:30.424 --> 01:32:35.645]  And if you don't have high-quality, long-lasting, storable foods, I believe you're making a huge mistake.

[01:33:14.396 --> 01:33:18.757]  You walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future.
[01:33:19.517 --> 01:33:21.838]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[01:33:22.979 --> 01:33:23.979]  This is not a new world.
[01:33:25.214 --> 01:33:29.597]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[01:33:29.617 --> 01:33:37.122]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[01:33:38.043 --> 01:33:44.988]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[01:33:46.108 --> 01:33:50.711]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[01:33:51.852 --> 01:33:54.074]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[01:33:59.426 --> 01:34:01.267]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[01:34:02.148 --> 01:34:07.771]  In his last 48 hours on Earth, he's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[01:34:08.811 --> 01:34:10.372]  Because he's built out of flesh.
[01:34:11.273 --> 01:34:12.373]  And because he has a mind.
[01:34:13.574 --> 01:34:18.257]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[01:34:22.293 --> 01:34:25.675]  You're listening to and you're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:25.735 --> 01:34:26.715]  We're here live 11 a.m.
[01:34:28.136 --> 01:34:28.696]  to 3 p.m.
[01:34:28.716 --> 01:34:28.776]  now.
[01:34:29.636 --> 01:34:34.419]  We have a fourth hour now added that will be hosted by David Knight today.
[01:34:34.439 --> 01:34:37.640]  I know he's got a big broadcast lined up at the fourth hour.
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:45.924]  He'll be joining us for about 5-6 minutes at 24 after next hour to give us an update on some of what he's going to be breaking down.
[01:34:46.304 --> 01:34:50.166]  I want to go to your calls Jason, Raider, Ron, Tara.
[01:34:50.706 --> 01:34:51.708]  John and others.
[01:34:51.728 --> 01:34:53.011]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:35:03.214 --> 01:35:04.115]  Over the top news.
[01:35:04.775 --> 01:35:07.978]  Russia may fire missiles at Syrian militants from Mediterranean Sea, officials say.
[01:35:08.339 --> 01:35:10.901]  Turkey downs drone over Syrian border amid Russian tensions.
[01:35:11.241 --> 01:35:14.224]  China says military will stand up and use force if U.S.
[01:35:14.244 --> 01:35:15.705]  sends warships to the islands.
[01:35:15.866 --> 01:35:16.206]  Period.
[01:35:16.406 --> 01:35:17.287]  Threats of war with China.
[01:35:18.128 --> 01:35:24.093]  ISIS in retreat as Russia destroys 32 targets while Putin trolls Obama as weak with no strategy.
[01:35:24.934 --> 01:35:29.438]  Russia, Iran begin promised assault on Syria's largest city and final bid to restore Assad.
[01:35:30.931 --> 01:35:35.155]  Iran ramps up troop deployment in Syria in run-up to anti-rebel offensive.
[01:35:35.835 --> 01:35:41.940]  Al-Qaeda in Syria leader says kill the entire Alawite minority, kill the Christians.
[01:35:42.421 --> 01:35:43.281]  Unbelievable statements.
[01:35:45.023 --> 01:35:46.984]  So that's just some of the news there we're going to be covering.
[01:35:48.085 --> 01:35:51.028]  Merkel faces domestic revolt over refugee welcome.
[01:35:51.908 --> 01:35:53.950]  Russia tried to cut off the World Wide Web.
[01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:55.992]  Yes, they're testing internet kill switch.
[01:35:56.412 --> 01:35:59.174]  And The Guardian and The Telegraph and others act like this is show.
[01:36:00.257 --> 01:36:01.159]  Uh, incredibly evil.
[01:36:01.219 --> 01:36:05.809]  Well, I mean, I agree that internet kill switch, or only allowing state-run media, is very draconian.
[01:36:05.869 --> 01:36:08.054]  And Russia is totalitarian to a certain extent.
[01:36:08.455 --> 01:36:09.056]  And I don't like it.
[01:36:10.151 --> 01:36:24.098]  But you know the United States had a kill switch in, they admitted about seven years ago, and now they call it the Obama kill switch, and it's fully in place to only send you White House messages on cable, TV, radio, internet, anytime they want.
[01:36:24.698 --> 01:36:27.480]  And now you notice they're forcing your phone to turn on and give you alerts.
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:32.983]  Some people are getting videos from the President now, forced emails when you're not on their email list.
[01:36:33.303 --> 01:36:37.445]  They're slowly testing the waters to have media takeover.
[01:36:38.743 --> 01:36:39.863]  And it's bad if the U.S.
[01:36:39.883 --> 01:36:41.164]  does it, bad if Russia does it.
[01:36:42.464 --> 01:36:44.844]  They'll go, there's a lot of state-run media in Russia.
[01:36:45.524 --> 01:36:48.085]  State-run, ABC, CBS, NBC.
[01:36:48.105 --> 01:36:52.186]  I mean, that stuff is admittedly run by psych warfare people.
[01:36:53.846 --> 01:36:55.927]  And it's not run by the General Pentagon or CIA.
[01:36:55.967 --> 01:37:04.969]  They have weird leftist social engineering nests that are at the top who basically write the Hollywood scripts.
[01:37:05.009 --> 01:37:06.269]  They write basic templates
[01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:10.211]  And then they just regurgitate them out on every platform.
[01:37:12.132 --> 01:37:13.713]  And it's truly sickening.
[01:37:14.233 --> 01:37:16.914]  I mean, you like going to see Hollywood movies where they just brainwash you?
[01:37:17.894 --> 01:37:20.275]  You like being a victim of them laughing at you?
[01:37:20.295 --> 01:37:21.656]  I mean, this is sick!
[01:37:22.796 --> 01:37:27.058]  And I'm trying to not get mad here, but I mean, this is ridiculous!
[01:37:28.547 --> 01:37:32.630]  Shame on Hollywood, shame on the CIA, shame on the Justice Department.
[01:37:32.670 --> 01:37:37.774]  I mean, look, I know you're anti-American crooks at the top who are parasites that live off us.
[01:37:38.254 --> 01:37:50.203]  And everybody knows, whether it's a spoiled rotten kid or spoiled rotten employees or whatever, that when you let people get spoiled rotten and live off of you, they end up becoming your masters and disdaining who feeds them.
[01:37:51.581 --> 01:37:52.301]  That's well known.
[01:37:52.841 --> 01:37:54.482]  You got punk kids, you spoil.
[01:37:55.182 --> 01:37:58.703]  There'll be 18 beating you up, demanding more money and grabbing it out of your purse.
[01:38:00.664 --> 01:38:01.905]  Because they were never disciplined.
[01:38:02.565 --> 01:38:07.947]  And we've got a bunch of people that actually believe that sucking blood out of us isn't enough!
[01:38:08.887 --> 01:38:11.948]  They want to kill the Golden Goose as an act of power.
[01:38:12.488 --> 01:38:14.589]  Bunch of spoiled, rotten scum.
[01:38:16.409 --> 01:38:17.570]  Here's the good news, filth.
[01:38:19.301 --> 01:38:21.225]  Congress has a 9% approval rating.
[01:38:21.706 --> 01:38:28.339]  We focused our attention on Monsanto and on Walmart and on other enemy operators.
[01:38:31.991 --> 01:38:35.813]  McDonald's, and they're already in free fall, and I'm going to tell you something, Disney.
[01:38:36.134 --> 01:38:38.375]  You better try to go do state-run media for China.
[01:38:38.675 --> 01:38:44.019]  You better try to get some other contracts elsewhere to keep your bottom line up, because we're now going to come after you.
[01:38:44.419 --> 01:38:49.762]  We're going to point out what unhuman, just trash of the earth you are.
[01:38:50.823 --> 01:38:51.524]  You filth.
[01:38:52.524 --> 01:38:59.569]  You absolutely diabolical, deceiving scum, dumbing this country down to the level of mindless jellyfish.
[01:39:01.223 --> 01:39:03.824]  You're never gonna get away with what you've done to humanity.
[01:39:04.564 --> 01:39:07.325]  You're never gonna get away with your hatred.
[01:39:08.505 --> 01:39:09.905]  People say, oh, you're the one that sounds hateful.
[01:39:10.206 --> 01:39:14.087]  Oh, no, no, look, I look foul, feel fair.
[01:39:14.807 --> 01:39:18.248]  Whereas they look fair, feel foul, to quote J.R.R.
[01:39:18.308 --> 01:39:18.708]  Tolkien.
[01:39:19.888 --> 01:39:21.069]  I'm not hiding anything here.
[01:39:21.929 --> 01:39:26.890]  I know I'm under chemical and biological attack, and I see the brain-damaged kids everywhere from the vaccines, and I have to live this.
[01:39:26.910 --> 01:39:29.111]  I have to watch you and know what you are.
[01:39:34.369 --> 01:39:36.230]  So I openly am disgusted.
[01:39:38.151 --> 01:39:41.573]  Okay, that's just some of the stats right there.
[01:39:42.693 --> 01:39:43.073]  Look at this.
[01:39:43.374 --> 01:39:44.514]  Look what they've turned us into.
[01:39:44.834 --> 01:39:47.295]  Children becoming hunchbacks due to addiction to smartphones.
[01:39:47.696 --> 01:39:50.177]  Smartphones can be worse for your skin than the sun.
[01:39:50.897 --> 01:39:52.278]  Everything they give us is to hurt us.
[01:39:52.778 --> 01:39:53.499]  Shock claim.
[01:39:53.539 --> 01:39:55.119]  World's on the brink of 50-year ice age.
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:00.222]  Scientists claim zapping brains with magnets can treat belief in God.
[01:40:00.762 --> 01:40:02.263]  Yeah, so can giving somebody a lobotomy.
[01:40:04.591 --> 01:40:08.433]  Did Parallel Universe open up 100-Sea Floating City, filmed in the skies above China?
[01:40:08.453 --> 01:40:09.213]  That's mainstream news.
[01:40:09.233 --> 01:40:10.394]  It was videotaped.
[01:40:10.874 --> 01:40:15.096]  And it's clearly a giant, 500-yard tall, wide hologram.
[01:40:17.317 --> 01:40:25.541]  Which they admit, China and the United States mainly, for social control, they projected, you know, again, 600-yard tall Jesuses in the desert.
[01:40:26.001 --> 01:40:27.742]  They did that in Operation Desert Storm.
[01:40:27.782 --> 01:40:31.024]  The Iraqis just, they hit them with hallucinogens, you name it.
[01:40:31.943 --> 01:40:34.065]  And they fly over and spray you with some hallucinogens.
[01:40:34.725 --> 01:40:39.108]  You can look that up and then hit you with, you know, Jesus and Muhammad fighting with lightsabers.
[01:40:39.769 --> 01:40:41.070]  Believe me, folks, start flipping out.
[01:40:42.048 --> 01:40:44.691]  By the way, they didn't just test it, they sprayed them with gay bombs.
[01:40:45.232 --> 01:40:48.655]  If you're a new listener, just type in Pentagon tested gay bomb on Iraq.
[01:40:48.956 --> 01:40:50.738]  They considered, no, they didn't consider using it.
[01:40:50.938 --> 01:40:53.120]  They've used it on our troops in Vietnam.
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.563]  They'd spray PCP on the troops, Jacob's Ladder.
[01:40:56.584 --> 01:41:00.108]  You think PCP, some horse tranquilizer something?
[01:41:00.609 --> 01:41:03.452]  They got stuff that'll whack your brain permanently.
[01:41:06.482 --> 01:41:07.783]  Brain chips in the troops!
[01:41:08.143 --> 01:41:13.048]  They give the troops special vaccines that are really nanotech that already re-engineer their brains.
[01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:17.151]  Now there it is, the gay bomb.
[01:41:19.233 --> 01:41:20.113]  Look it up for yourself.
[01:41:20.173 --> 01:41:22.736]  I mean, this is what they're... What do you think tap water is?
[01:41:22.796 --> 01:41:23.937]  It's a gay bomb, baby!
[01:41:26.038 --> 01:41:29.079]  And I'm not saying people didn't naturally have homosexual feelings.
[01:41:29.379 --> 01:41:31.099]  I'm not even getting into it, quite frankly.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:32.280]  I mean, give me a break!
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:37.541]  You think I'm like, shocked by it, so I'm up here bashing it because I don't like gay people?
[01:41:37.841 --> 01:41:41.863]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[01:41:42.763 --> 01:41:43.943]  Do you understand that?
[01:41:45.704 --> 01:41:46.544]  Serious crap!
[01:41:47.344 --> 01:41:49.485]  I'm sick of being social engineered, it's not funny!
[01:41:51.966 --> 01:41:52.186]  Okay.
[01:41:53.366 --> 01:41:53.646]  Dammit.
[01:41:53.706 --> 01:41:55.207]  I just dropped a bunch of stuff off the side of here.
[01:41:55.227 --> 01:41:55.867]  I need those articles.
[01:41:55.887 --> 01:41:56.427]  Somebody give them to me.
[01:41:57.347 --> 01:41:58.727]  I apologize to the family audience.
[01:41:58.747 --> 01:41:59.468]  I'm going to settle down.
[01:41:59.488 --> 01:42:02.648]  I haven't done this in months and I'm just, I just cannot handle it anymore.
[01:42:03.529 --> 01:42:04.209]  I apologize.
[01:42:04.249 --> 01:42:04.949]  I apologize.
[01:42:05.069 --> 01:42:05.769]  Jesus, forgive me.
[01:42:08.049 --> 01:42:09.070]  Let me just get back to the news.
[01:42:09.110 --> 01:42:09.450]  Thank you.
[01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:13.831]  Children becoming hunchbacks due to addiction to smartphones.
[01:42:14.571 --> 01:42:14.791]  Again.
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:29.185]  Weather Outlook, Big Snow for Northeast, Relief of Thirsty California, Record Snow, Fears Grow Over Increased Antibiotic Resistance, Care for Chronic Fain, World First Patient Fitted with Permanent Spinal Cord Implant.
[01:42:31.266 --> 01:42:33.527]  Rise of the Cheap and Cheerful Warehouse Robot.
[01:42:33.547 --> 01:42:34.528]  Oh, see how good it is?
[01:42:37.809 --> 01:42:39.270]  That is just two of the stacks.
[01:42:39.290 --> 01:42:42.271]  I've got, like, twelve more of them.
[01:42:44.072 --> 01:42:46.133]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls, I apologize.
[01:42:51.578 --> 01:42:54.580]  You know, maybe I shouldn't apologize because Christ was God and I'm just a man.
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:56.121]  He beat the money changers with a whip.
[01:42:56.801 --> 01:43:03.265]  Overturned their tables and basically, depending on which version you read, the Jewish version in the histories was basically just punching people in the nose as well.
[01:43:04.586 --> 01:43:06.007]  I just cannot handle it.
[01:43:06.667 --> 01:43:14.051]  I just cannot believe that they harvest millions of babies and even try to keep them alive a few days so they can harvest them properly.
[01:43:14.532 --> 01:43:19.835]  And China keeps people alive and takes part of the organs and keeps them alive months in some cases, ripping them out.
[01:43:20.615 --> 01:43:22.656]  And our media criticizes you if you're against that.
[01:43:22.696 --> 01:43:24.556]  I mean, don't we have any value for ourselves?
[01:43:24.997 --> 01:43:27.518]  Don't we know the people running things are bloodthirsty and hate us?
[01:43:27.878 --> 01:43:29.058]  And don't have goodwill for us?
[01:43:29.118 --> 01:43:30.018]  I mean, this is crazy!
[01:43:31.619 --> 01:43:42.423]  And then I flipped out yesterday because they're announcing a new Justice Department mega-unit with their number one national directive to go after conservatives and veterans and libertarians and gun owners.
[01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:56.294]  They're announcing all this executive gun-grabbing outside of law, and they're announcing they believe the Tea Party's going to start blowing stuff up any minute, while they persecute people illegally, and I just know full well what these scum are going to pull!
[01:43:57.874 --> 01:44:01.735]  I mean, do people at the Justice Department really want to be involved in more false flags?
[01:44:02.035 --> 01:44:04.936]  Do you really like blowing up daycare centers and whamming it on the states?
[01:44:06.667 --> 01:44:11.368]  They were about to have a state's rights movement to get out of the UN in globalism in 1994-95.
[01:44:11.468 --> 01:44:20.149]  Oklahoma was leading a state coalition of 27 states to do it, and so they blew up the federal building and blamed it on the patriots.
[01:44:21.170 --> 01:44:23.390]  And I'm telling you, that's the kind of crap they're going to pull.
[01:44:23.850 --> 01:44:25.370]  And what does even Steven Seagal say?
[01:44:25.390 --> 01:44:26.971]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:44:29.131 --> 01:44:35.392]  I believe in the Second Amendment, and I believe a lot of these mass murders going on, that a lot of these are engineered.
[01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:49.331]  I don't know, they had Al-Qaeda launch two chemical attacks on Assad, and film it and post it bragging, screaming Allah Akbar, and they still blamed the Syrian government.
[01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:55.312]  They wouldn't do anything like that here.
[01:44:55.352 --> 01:44:57.434]  I mean, they'd abort 55 million babies.
[01:44:57.474 --> 01:44:59.336]  They'd keep babies alive and sell their body parts.
[01:44:59.356 --> 01:45:04.661]  You know, we have videos of 8-month-old, 7-month-old babies fighting scalpels for their lives.
[01:45:04.901 --> 01:45:12.048]  You know a baby at 5 months starts fighting the scalpel and jerking his legs away and fighting as the fingers, the arm, the hand, up the shoulder, the foot.
[01:45:12.549 --> 01:45:13.990]  They get the neck, blood starts spraying.
[01:45:15.231 --> 01:45:15.672]  They get in.
[01:45:17.481 --> 01:45:19.541]  Even a baby will fight for its life in the womb.
[01:45:19.821 --> 01:45:21.462]  Won't you fight for your life?
[01:45:21.842 --> 01:45:23.962]  Won't you recognize who these scum are?
[01:45:26.322 --> 01:45:27.803]  I'm gonna say it real slow for you.
[01:45:28.423 --> 01:45:30.223]  They were testing different political systems.
[01:45:30.243 --> 01:45:31.543]  These are scientists that we fight.
[01:45:32.063 --> 01:45:36.604]  They tested Bolshevik Communism in 1917 in Russia.
[01:45:37.144 --> 01:45:38.344]  It killed 50 million people.
[01:45:39.645 --> 01:45:40.305]  Conservatively.
[01:45:41.385 --> 01:45:43.445]  They put Mao in in 49.
[01:45:43.485 --> 01:45:44.386]  That's declassified.
[01:45:44.406 --> 01:45:47.066]  The CIA put Mao in that killed 84 million people.
[01:45:48.379 --> 01:45:53.843]  They then, as a counter to it, created Nazi fascism as a scientific test to see what that would do.
[01:45:56.525 --> 01:46:01.729]  Do you understand that the United States and England gave birth to communism and Nazism?
[01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:08.054]  So while you're talking about those as the old evils, those little dragons, look at Mama, if you want to know what we're facing.
[01:46:08.374 --> 01:46:10.656]  Mama kills you in the water and the vaccines.
[01:46:10.976 --> 01:46:12.497]  Mama kills you with brainwashing.
[01:46:12.837 --> 01:46:14.298]  Mama kills you with liberalism.
[01:46:14.619 --> 01:46:17.781]  Mama kills you with lots of trendies wearing non-threatening clothing.
[01:46:22.102 --> 01:46:23.063]  It's camouflage.
[01:46:23.523 --> 01:46:26.146]  Not the actual trendy, that's a brainwashed, brain-damaged idiot.
[01:46:26.366 --> 01:46:30.010]  But their master controllers know exactly what they're doing.
[01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:30.990]  These are technicians.
[01:46:31.331 --> 01:46:32.132]  They get orders.
[01:46:34.594 --> 01:46:36.696]  We're completely overrun, people.
[01:46:37.056 --> 01:46:39.518]  But if you wake up to the criminals, it's game over.
[01:46:40.279 --> 01:46:42.041]  But you've got to break with them.
[01:46:42.561 --> 01:46:43.282]  I'm gonna go to your calls.
[01:46:44.483 --> 01:46:45.884]  I gotta pay the bills here also.
[01:46:48.482 --> 01:46:50.504]  I, uh, Super Mel Vitality is back in.
[01:46:50.524 --> 01:46:52.305]  In fact, I didn't take any today.
[01:46:54.747 --> 01:46:55.428]  I probably shouldn't.
[01:46:56.168 --> 01:46:58.390]  And it's just really high-powered, concentrated herbs.
[01:46:58.910 --> 01:47:00.371]  Go research the facts for yourself.
[01:47:00.412 --> 01:47:01.673]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:47:02.273 --> 01:47:05.996]  And this is really popular with weightlifters, athletes, uh, bodybuilders.
[01:47:09.879 --> 01:47:16.704]  Some of the top UFC people take it, but they've already got other sponsors, but they've contacted me and they just want to plug it without even money, because it's worked so well for them.
[01:47:18.962 --> 01:47:19.543]  It's a real deal.
[01:47:23.746 --> 01:47:25.567]  Take a couple squirts of that a day and it'll set you right.
[01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:29.631]  So it's back in.
[01:47:31.812 --> 01:47:33.774]  Super Male Vitality is back in.

[01:48:05.876 --> 01:48:07.517]  We have Liver Shield back in stock.
[01:48:07.557 --> 01:48:08.958]  You've heard all the rave reviews about that.
[01:48:10.706 --> 01:48:20.130]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, Madein1776.com, the Hillary for Prison shirts, and your purchase supports things.
[01:48:20.170 --> 01:48:25.652]  By the way, it takes different strokes for different folks in society and in culture.
[01:48:27.773 --> 01:48:32.115]  And I have a lot of intellectuals on and a lot of people that are really into being controlled, being focused.
[01:48:35.576 --> 01:48:39.478]  But none of them has been as successful as I have warning people, waking people up.
[01:48:41.010 --> 01:48:41.951]  I don't do it on purpose.
[01:48:42.191 --> 01:48:47.136]  I get sick of sitting here calmly talking about all this and I blow up maybe every week or so, every two weeks.
[01:48:47.156 --> 01:48:48.057]  This was a big blow up today.
[01:48:49.198 --> 01:48:49.818]  And it's genuine.
[01:48:49.858 --> 01:48:53.142]  It's therapy for me because, you know, it's better than me doing this when I get home.
[01:48:54.062 --> 01:48:55.243]  When my kids are bad or something.
[01:48:56.865 --> 01:49:00.508]  Or it's better than me doing this when some guy bumps into me in a grocery store and says, watch it punk.
[01:49:01.449 --> 01:49:05.073]  You know, if I haven't blown up before in the week on air or something, I might blow up on them.
[01:49:08.609 --> 01:49:10.071]  And that's therapy that'll get you out of trouble.
[01:49:10.531 --> 01:49:12.474]  Bouncing their head up and down on the ground like a basketball.
[01:49:16.667 --> 01:49:20.970]  But I'm here to tell you, you know, we get people on saying, Alex, you don't need to get upset, you don't need to yell and scream.
[01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:25.533]  You know, we need to just calmly tell the public, we have calmly told the public, they're in a trance.
[01:49:25.873 --> 01:49:31.978]  And I'm here shaking people in their trance going, wake up, wake up, snap out of it, snap out of it.
[01:49:32.118 --> 01:49:34.339]  You have been under cult brainwashing.
[01:49:34.599 --> 01:49:35.320]  Come out of it.
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:37.261]  They admit they're brainwashing you.
[01:49:37.522 --> 01:49:40.624]  Obama signed an executive order to expand brainwashing.
[01:49:41.144 --> 01:49:50.070]  Domestically, even at the local level with the CIA and psychiatrists and psychologists and to develop plans to tell you how to think.
[01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:54.612]  Do you realize the level of mind control that statement alone is?
[01:49:55.293 --> 01:49:56.314]  It was already going on.
[01:49:58.335 --> 01:50:00.136]  But they're gonna main line it.
[01:50:05.643 --> 01:50:07.084]  You've got to get moving.
[01:50:07.164 --> 01:50:08.265]  You've got to get aggressive.
[01:50:08.305 --> 01:50:09.266]  You've got to get mad.
[01:50:09.886 --> 01:50:11.027]  You've got to get focused.
[01:50:11.047 --> 01:50:12.428]  You've got to get crazed.
[01:50:13.469 --> 01:50:14.830]  You've got to get motivated, man.
[01:50:14.850 --> 01:50:15.671]  We are under attack.
[01:50:16.631 --> 01:50:17.992]  We've got to show people what's happening.
[01:50:18.013 --> 01:50:18.973]  We need flash mobs.
[01:50:19.213 --> 01:50:20.214]  We need banner hangs.
[01:50:20.454 --> 01:50:26.859]  We need aggressive, legal, lawful stunts to get the word out and expose the New World Order.
[01:50:27.119 --> 01:50:28.360]  Don't count on me to do it.
[01:50:28.481 --> 01:50:35.266]  I'm going to start... I pledge to you that I'm going to start pulling some incredible legal stunts.
[01:50:36.621 --> 01:50:45.527]  I'm going to go to people's houses, I'm going to go to the government, I'm going to go to the city council, and I'm going to demand to be able to sleep on the dais because I'm a migrant.
[01:50:46.048 --> 01:50:48.690]  I'm going to demand, I'm going to go to the mayor's house, I'm going to demand to live in his house.
[01:50:50.205 --> 01:50:54.309]  I mean, this is the kind of stunts we gotta do to show how ridiculous these people are.
[01:50:54.509 --> 01:50:58.632]  I think I'm gonna sue the mayor of Austin, like the illegals are doing, and they don't let me live in his house.
[01:50:59.073 --> 01:50:59.593]  I'm serious.
[01:51:00.354 --> 01:51:06.820]  We gotta get in these people's faces and just let them know we're fully aware of their garbage, and we're not putting up with it anymore.
[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:08.982]  And George Soros and all these people.
[01:51:10.462 --> 01:51:13.103]  If survivalist housing has been in your plans, get ready.
[01:51:13.303 --> 01:51:17.125]  We're bringing our Timberline Range Camps to you February 6th through 14th.
[01:51:17.365 --> 01:51:20.066]  The Great American Outdoor Show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
[01:51:20.266 --> 01:51:26.889]  Get an up-close look at some of our most popular Timberline models or visit survivalistcamps.com to pre-order a camp.
[01:51:27.110 --> 01:51:29.351]  We'll bring it to the show and save you the cost of shipping.
[01:51:29.711 --> 01:51:31.912]  It's the perfect time to get that camp you've wanted.
[01:51:32.132 --> 01:51:39.035]  Go to survivalistcamps.com, then plan on joining us at the Great American Outdoor Show in February in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
[01:51:41.212 --> 01:51:42.313]  We've all heard the news stories.
[01:51:42.773 --> 01:51:43.514]  Another shooting.
[01:51:43.914 --> 01:51:45.135]  And they're getting worse.
[01:51:45.615 --> 01:51:48.838]  That's why Infidel Body Armor introduces Infidel Fridays.
[01:51:49.178 --> 01:51:53.842]  Exclusive 24-hour insider deals to save you money and possibly save your life.
[01:51:54.182 --> 01:51:57.324]  Make it a favorite when you log on to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:57.485 --> 01:52:03.229]  Then be sure to visit each and every Infidel Friday to get special insider pricing, but for 24 hours only.
[01:52:03.369 --> 01:52:05.070]  That's InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:52:05.311 --> 01:52:08.013]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:13.996]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[01:52:14.176 --> 01:52:18.361]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[01:52:18.421 --> 01:52:25.591]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Mason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[01:52:25.771 --> 01:52:36.275]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[01:52:36.435 --> 01:52:39.776]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[01:52:39.916 --> 01:52:40.957]  What do you have to lose?
[01:52:41.037 --> 01:52:49.320]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:52.683]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[01:52:52.783 --> 01:52:56.807]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[01:52:56.927 --> 01:52:59.050]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[01:52:59.230 --> 01:53:06.197]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:53:09.580 --> 01:53:10.460]  Hey, Berky Guy here.

[01:54:12.885 --> 01:54:19.228]  The preacher man says it's the end of time in the Mississippi River she's a gold drive.
[01:54:19.248 --> 01:54:21.949]  Alright, folks, I've been holding nearly an hour.
[01:54:21.969 --> 01:54:22.789]  I apologize.
[01:54:22.809 --> 01:54:25.770]  I will take like 10, 15 calls and then get back into the news.
[01:54:29.132 --> 01:54:41.957]  There is a lot of economic news needs to be covered, a lot of internet censorship news, a lot of just other stuff that illustrates how Obama says that Africans shouldn't be able to have vacations, cars, air conditioning.
[01:54:43.231 --> 01:54:49.835]  Standard of living, but then he spent $4.4 million on golf course and private fundraisers in the last two months alone.
[01:54:50.315 --> 01:54:51.036]  Taxpayer money.
[01:54:52.317 --> 01:54:53.417]  Totally illegal, by the way.
[01:54:53.537 --> 01:54:55.538]  You're not supposed to do all that with taxpayer money.
[01:54:56.939 --> 01:55:09.587]  But don't worry, they've indicted, and are now trying, two of Ron Paul's chief people for giving money to other Libertarians who were running for office, and then those people endorsed them, claiming that was a paid endorsement.
[01:55:11.766 --> 01:55:13.648]  It's just all how you phrase something.
[01:55:15.009 --> 01:55:19.393]  It is illegal to run for state or federal office in America, the way the laws are read.
[01:55:21.955 --> 01:55:26.759]  They could indict a piece of lemon pie for murder, for just sitting on a table.
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:28.761]  I mean, they can do whatever they want.
[01:55:28.781 --> 01:55:29.922]  It's a total joke.
[01:55:31.723 --> 01:55:33.084]  And the government is discredited.
[01:55:33.144 --> 01:55:33.865]  It is illegitimate.
[01:55:34.909 --> 01:55:39.850]  Hillary can take billions from foreign governments to her foundation to ship them weapons at the State Department.
[01:55:40.311 --> 01:55:43.992]  Publicly ripping everyone off in giant organized crime, nakedly.
[01:55:44.692 --> 01:55:45.252]  And it's okay.
[01:55:48.673 --> 01:55:57.616]  But the Texas Attorney General at dinner, before he was Attorney General, told people what he thought was a good investment, even though he hadn't been an investment trader for over two years.
[01:55:58.036 --> 01:56:02.277]  He just told them what he thought was a good investment, and they've indicted him.
[01:56:04.022 --> 01:56:05.724]  Because he didn't register anymore.
[01:56:06.025 --> 01:56:07.246]  Oh, you weren't registered anymore?
[01:56:07.486 --> 01:56:08.588]  You said this was a good investment.
[01:56:08.708 --> 01:56:11.111]  We're going to indict you because you're fighting Obama.
[01:56:16.057 --> 01:56:18.120]  They're making their criminal move.
[01:56:18.881 --> 01:56:19.762]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:56:20.242 --> 01:56:21.284]  Jason in Texas.
[01:56:21.344 --> 01:56:22.205]  Jason, you're on the air.
[01:56:22.245 --> 01:56:22.766]  Thanks for calling.
[01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:36.671]  Hey Alex, so today I wanted to talk about admiralty jurisdiction and something that most Americans don't actually understand is that the Constitution, Article 3, Section 2 provides for three separate jurisdictions which are law, equity, and admiralty.
[01:56:37.071 --> 01:56:41.334]  So for the listeners that aren't aware, law or common law is what the nation was founded upon.
[01:56:41.415 --> 01:56:42.676]  It goes back to the Magna Carta.
[01:56:42.976 --> 01:56:43.676]  It's really simple.
[01:56:43.937 --> 01:56:47.900]  Don't injure, don't harm others or their property, and don't use fraud in your contracts.
[01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:52.742]  Any crimes committed under the common law require there to be a corpus delecti or an injured party.
[01:56:53.342 --> 01:56:56.983]  Equity is a jurisdiction of contracts and doesn't encompass criminal activities.
[01:56:57.403 --> 01:57:01.505]  And finally, we have admiralty jurisdiction, which is the law of the military and of the high seas.
[01:57:02.105 --> 01:57:07.107]  So, for example, a soldier that refuses to peel potatoes when ordered is a criminal act, even if there is no injured party.
[01:57:07.685 --> 01:57:19.190]  Now, it's under admiralty jurisdiction that the United States citizens are criminally prosecuted... And that normally only operated at sea or under wartime emergencies if you were in the military and did not have a jurisdiction over the general public.
[01:57:19.211 --> 01:57:28.295]  But through fraud and contract fraud, getting us to opt into admiralty, it's been brought in now to be one of the dominant forms of law as we move into administrative.
[01:57:29.321 --> 01:57:29.701]  Exactly.
[01:57:29.741 --> 01:57:31.342]  It's been done with our silent consent.
[01:57:31.743 --> 01:57:36.866]  And it's the extension of this admiralty jurisdiction to the colonists that was actually one of the prime reasons behind the revolution.
[01:57:37.266 --> 01:57:40.968]  So almost every court in the United States today, the jurisdiction is assumed.
[01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:54.177]  Number one was them trying to take the guns, but number two was British press kings grabbing people's 8, 9, 10 year old boys off their front porches or from school or from the fields and taking them to be slaves on British ships.
[01:57:55.549 --> 01:58:04.862]  No, what you can't do is, you can't, a licensed attorney can't actually go into court and make this kind of jurisdictional challenge because they've already consented to being part of the system.
[01:58:04.882 --> 01:58:06.264]  No, I've had, I've not found that.
[01:58:06.284 --> 01:58:12.012]  I've got really great lawyers and they routinely cite common law precedent and are successful in court.
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:18.543]  And I actually did that pretty recently to get a minor traffic fence thrown out, and that was pretty rewarding.
[01:58:19.003 --> 01:58:21.084]  Now, some of the listeners might ask, you know, how did we get here?
[01:58:21.104 --> 01:58:22.885]  I didn't consent to being under military rule.
[01:58:23.566 --> 01:58:27.868]  But as you mentioned, we've basically, we've tacitly agreed to this jurisdiction.
[01:58:28.148 --> 01:58:30.590]  Pretty much all of the municipal governments are corporate entities.
[01:58:30.630 --> 01:58:37.093]  The Incorporated City of Austin, the Incorporated State of Texas, the Incorporated District of Columbia, and yes, the Incorporated United States.
[01:58:37.634 --> 01:58:39.595]  We agree to become trustees in their corporations.
[01:58:39.935 --> 01:58:40.876]  Listen, I agree with you.
[01:58:40.936 --> 01:58:42.357]  That's how they set up the fraud.
[01:58:42.377 --> 01:58:42.717]  Stay there.
[01:58:42.737 --> 01:58:43.618]  I'm going to come back to you.
[01:58:44.499 --> 01:58:46.701]  But now it's gone to the force of a barrel of a gun.
[01:58:46.721 --> 01:58:48.102]  They don't even operate in that now.
[01:58:48.382 --> 01:58:48.802]  We'll be back.
[01:58:48.823 --> 01:58:49.263]  Third hour.
[01:58:49.283 --> 01:58:49.723]  Stay with us.
[01:58:50.064 --> 01:58:52.165]  Truth Raider, Ron, Tara, John, be patient.
[01:58:52.185 --> 01:58:53.146]  I'm going to get to you.
[01:58:53.166 --> 01:58:54.047]  We're taking the calls.
[01:58:54.427 --> 01:58:55.028]  It's Friday.

[01:59:00.054 --> 01:59:03.256]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[01:59:31.005 --> 01:59:33.105]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.

[01:59:41.489 --> 01:59:44.691]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:59:44.971 --> 01:59:46.771]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:59:46.952 --> 01:59:47.852]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:59:47.872 --> 01:59:48.812]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:59:49.052 --> 01:59:50.953]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[02:00:02.155 --> 02:00:04.723]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:16.195 --> 02:00:16.835]  Big Brother.
[02:00:17.496 --> 02:00:18.536]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:19.257 --> 02:00:20.358]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:21.018 --> 02:00:21.839]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.599 --> 02:00:23.520]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:27.802]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.363 --> 02:00:32.445]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.665 --> 02:00:35.947]  I'm not trying to run over Jason, I'm just backing up what he's saying.
[02:00:37.708 --> 02:00:44.953]  The truth is, the three forms of law you're talking about being integrated together... I mean, you can put different names on them.
[02:00:47.267 --> 02:00:59.531]  The system basically operates in all three, but now they're just creating totally made-up memos in the federal government where they say, we can secretly arrest you, we can torture you, we can deal drugs if we want, because we're God.
[02:00:59.992 --> 02:01:03.653]  It's now just reached Hitlerian, totalitarian levels where
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:07.022]  It's not even based in any form of law.
[02:01:07.122 --> 02:01:08.563]  It's just total garbage.
[02:01:09.324 --> 02:01:11.466]  And they do it by increment, they do it by practice.
[02:01:12.066 --> 02:01:18.312]  So they would kind of argue that it's common law, that if they can commonly operate a tyranny, it becomes a taking.
[02:01:20.134 --> 02:01:26.540]  I don't claim to be a lawyer, but I can sit around with constitutional lawyers, litigators, top lawyers, and they'd say, wow, you want to be a lawyer?
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:28.081]  You're more law knowledgeable than most lawyers.
[02:01:28.722 --> 02:01:30.544]  And I'm just knowledgeable in the general
[02:01:33.149 --> 02:01:37.753]  execution of law throughout history and some of the different systems of laws they've had.
[02:01:38.153 --> 02:01:40.135]  But I don't want to get off into a treatise on law.
[02:01:41.015 --> 02:01:42.556]  What was your final point there, Jason?
[02:01:42.577 --> 02:01:45.379]  I'm going to go to Ron, Tara, John, Truthrader, and others.
[02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:51.924]  Basically that we've just agreed to become trustees in their municipal corporations and their governmental bodies.
[02:01:52.004 --> 02:01:54.867]  We sacrifice our inherent rights for the privileges and immunities.
[02:01:54.887 --> 02:01:56.668]  You know, we sign our sole security contract.
[02:01:56.908 --> 02:01:58.149]  We sign our driver's licenses.
[02:01:58.189 --> 02:01:59.110]  We accept the benefits.
[02:01:59.650 --> 02:02:00.751]  You know, welfare, unemployment.
[02:02:00.771 --> 02:02:04.274]  We go see Disney movies when Disney's sworn to destroy the family and the country.
[02:02:05.970 --> 02:02:11.114]  So, and I guess the last thing I'd have to say is about these so-called sovereign citizens, which really is an oxymoron.
[02:02:12.094 --> 02:02:17.158]  You know, most of these sovereign citizens are still accepting, you know, some of the privileges of being part of this system.
[02:02:17.298 --> 02:02:23.883]  Yeah, they use it like, I mean, not all of them, but a lot of them use it like they're getting ahead on somebody or they sue their neighbors.
[02:02:23.943 --> 02:02:26.105]  Not a lot of them, but some of them are really nasty.
[02:02:26.405 --> 02:02:27.626]  Some of them do make stuff up.
[02:02:27.926 --> 02:02:29.327]  Some of them do engage in fraud.
[02:02:30.107 --> 02:02:31.528]  I've had to deal with some of it myself.
[02:02:31.609 --> 02:02:34.411]  But then they discredit the legitimate pro se people.
[02:02:34.451 --> 02:02:34.691]  Go ahead.
[02:02:36.129 --> 02:02:39.911]  If we want to become true sovereigns, we have to learn to step out of the system entirely.
[02:02:39.971 --> 02:02:50.836]  I don't know how possible that is anymore, but, you know, learning to produce our own food, learning to trade on our own terms with Bitcoin, with gold, with silver, and exiting this United States dollar, you know, these Federal Reserve notes.
[02:02:51.156 --> 02:03:05.003]  Well, I agree with you that, I mean, it's absolutely essential to vote with your dollars every way you can, and try to not shop with the New World Order, and also criticize them, talk bad about them, just they're nasty.
[02:03:05.823 --> 02:03:11.166]  All these big major corporations, Monsanto, Disney, Time Warner, all of them.
[02:03:11.246 --> 02:03:14.148]  And sometimes, you know, we got Time Warner as a backup here.
[02:03:14.188 --> 02:03:15.728]  We've got to have three forms of internet.
[02:03:16.109 --> 02:03:17.109]  That's what's available.
[02:03:17.649 --> 02:03:18.530]  That's what we've got.
[02:03:19.010 --> 02:03:21.952]  So sometimes it's essential to weigh it.
[02:03:23.157 --> 02:03:27.380]  You know, do I work with this enemy so that I can attack them through their own system?
[02:03:27.901 --> 02:03:28.802]  And so I do.
[02:03:29.822 --> 02:03:31.104]  I really appreciate your call.
[02:03:31.144 --> 02:03:37.329]  I mean, it'd be like if you were fighting in a foreign war and you're out of ammo, and you capture some of the enemy's rifles and ammo.
[02:03:38.029 --> 02:03:40.451]  I mean, is it traitorous to use their weapons against them?
[02:03:40.491 --> 02:03:40.691]  No.
[02:03:40.711 --> 02:03:49.919]  If I've got tanks coming over me and I'm out of ammo, and I've just killed a couple of enemy soldiers and they've got rocket launchers laying there, you know, phosphorus-tipped anti-tank weapons, I'm going to use them.
[02:03:51.112 --> 02:03:56.379]  And before I go into battle, I'm going to try to know what the enemy's weapon systems are so that I can use them against them.
[02:03:56.699 --> 02:03:57.781]  Well, that's what I do.
[02:03:57.861 --> 02:04:01.325]  I don't know how to use a phosphorus-tipped anti-tank weapon.
[02:04:01.586 --> 02:04:03.629]  Actually, I do, but it depends on the model.
[02:04:03.649 --> 02:04:04.590]  I've done a little research.
[02:04:04.610 --> 02:04:05.351]  This is interesting.
[02:04:05.591 --> 02:04:08.375]  But I do know how to use Facebook and Twitter and YouTube.
[02:04:08.855 --> 02:04:13.498]  I do know how to use their own systems against them, and I will use it against them.
[02:04:13.598 --> 02:04:22.264]  I will attack them with the truth, because they attack the innocents, they are attacking everyone, and I know what crazed, sworn enemies they are of our families.
[02:04:23.085 --> 02:04:25.446]  Absolutely sworn to destroy us.
[02:04:26.127 --> 02:04:27.968]  And their average employee is not bad.
[02:04:29.517 --> 02:04:33.263]  At Microsoft, at Google, at these companies.
[02:04:33.343 --> 02:04:35.186]  In fact, that's why we are so successful.
[02:04:35.506 --> 02:04:41.254]  Because we're just naked, we're bare bones, in the trenches like cavemen, foaming at the mouth.
[02:04:41.495 --> 02:04:44.439]  We're under attack, we know it, and we're going crazy.
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:47.601]  And other humans understand we're telling the truth.
[02:04:47.901 --> 02:04:48.701]  They know the truth.
[02:04:48.981 --> 02:04:50.741]  They know they're just surviving, working for the enemy.
[02:04:50.881 --> 02:04:51.681]  We don't blame them.
[02:04:51.741 --> 02:04:52.442]  We understand.
[02:04:53.022 --> 02:04:54.322]  Just get the intel out.
[02:04:54.602 --> 02:04:56.743]  Build your own systems with the money you get from the enemy.
[02:04:57.403 --> 02:04:59.803]  And just work with others to build parallel programs.
[02:05:00.163 --> 02:05:02.344]  And just pray for the fall of the New World Order.
[02:05:02.644 --> 02:05:04.484]  And pray that they bleed out of their eyes.
[02:05:04.504 --> 02:05:06.405]  And that they rot in hell forever.
[02:05:06.845 --> 02:05:07.245]  We'll be back.
[02:05:10.234 --> 02:05:14.755]  Villains in new Captain America comic are opponents of illegal immigration.
[02:05:15.016 --> 02:05:18.477]  Article up by Steve Watson at Infowars.com.
[02:05:18.637 --> 02:05:23.198]  Captain America started out by taking on Nazis and defending freedom.
[02:05:23.498 --> 02:05:31.101]  Now, however, Marvel has him siding with Democrats in Washington and beating up on conservatives who quote the U.S.
[02:05:31.161 --> 02:05:32.041]  Constitution.
[02:05:32.581 --> 02:05:32.882]  U.S.
[02:05:32.982 --> 02:05:36.165]  boots on the ground in Africa, article by Kurt Nemo.
[02:05:36.505 --> 02:05:38.527]  Obama announced on Wednesday the U.S.
[02:05:38.547 --> 02:05:41.390]  will deploy troops to the African nation of Cameroon.
[02:05:41.590 --> 02:05:45.014]  Ron Paul filed a report on the deployment on Thursday.
[02:05:45.294 --> 02:05:50.139]  300 soldiers will be sent to the West African nation to conduct airborne intelligence.
[02:05:50.379 --> 02:05:54.840]  Surveillance and reconnaissance operations end the region, according to the BBC.
[02:05:54.980 --> 02:06:07.103]  The effort will expand the mission of AFRICOM, the Pentagon's African command, and would be part of a broader regional effort to stop the spread of vocal harm and other violent extremist organizations in West Africa.
[02:06:07.223 --> 02:06:09.444]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[02:06:10.164 --> 02:06:13.865]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:06:14.125 --> 02:06:20.267]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:06:20.427 --> 02:06:27.449]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:06:27.789 --> 02:06:33.730]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:36.631]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[02:06:36.991 --> 02:06:37.472]  We're good.
[02:06:55.914 --> 02:07:02.763]  These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
[02:07:02.783 --> 02:07:06.849]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[02:07:07.090 --> 02:07:07.951]  Consult your physician.
[02:07:09.972 --> 02:07:16.133]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:07:16.213 --> 02:07:18.854]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:07:18.894 --> 02:07:25.655]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:07:25.935 --> 02:07:28.796]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:07:28.936 --> 02:07:31.856]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:07:31.876 --> 02:07:33.856]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:07:33.896 --> 02:07:36.737]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:07:36.817 --> 02:07:42.319]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:07:42.539 --> 02:07:46.020]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:49.041]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:07:49.061 --> 02:07:56.244]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[02:08:06.067 --> 02:08:06.767]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:08:06.788 --> 02:08:08.028]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:08.088 --> 02:08:08.569]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:31.271 --> 02:08:34.613]  The oldest fictional character in the 1970s hit film, Network.
[02:08:35.294 --> 02:08:40.637]  Robert Duvall said, I don't know what all the answers are, but first I know you've got to get mad.
[02:08:41.177 --> 02:08:42.318]  You've got to say, I'm a human being.
[02:08:42.378 --> 02:08:43.399]  My life has value.
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:47.201]  And that's the point I've gotten to, is I get a little upset about this.
[02:08:47.261 --> 02:08:49.083]  I get way upset sometimes and start blowing up.
[02:08:49.623 --> 02:08:51.024]  We're going to your phone calls right now.
[02:08:51.324 --> 02:08:53.305]  I mentioned this back in the last hour.
[02:08:53.826 --> 02:08:55.607]  So they brought it in from the New American Magazine.
[02:08:57.267 --> 02:09:06.955]  And it links to a whole bunch of international UN documents, Harvard, you name it, that blacks suffer most from fluoride, but fluoridate anyway.
[02:09:07.595 --> 02:09:14.281]  And then it gets into the studies that it's at least double bad for cancer, IQ loss, heart problems.
[02:09:14.341 --> 02:09:17.583]  I mean, fluoride for black people is really bad.
[02:09:18.684 --> 02:09:25.269]  And that's because the average black person, on average, has higher hormone levels of a bunch of key endocrines.
[02:09:26.315 --> 02:09:29.258]  And you add fluoride into that, it is a really nasty mix.
[02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:32.901]  So, there you go.
[02:09:33.141 --> 02:09:34.102]  Just thought I'd tell you about that.
[02:09:34.122 --> 02:09:42.148]  You're not going to hear the NAACP talk about the number one health threat to black people in the country and why they've got much higher levels of heart disease and so many other things.
[02:09:42.929 --> 02:09:44.771]  Just, you know, let's just not worry about that.
[02:09:45.111 --> 02:09:47.513]  Let's just... Besides, I mean, who needs to listen to me?
[02:09:47.733 --> 02:09:48.394]  I mean, you know.
[02:09:49.093 --> 02:09:54.919]  Mr. Crackerhead here, uh, you know, Mr. Racist here, wants you to arrest me because I once saw a rebel flag.
[02:09:55.499 --> 02:09:57.141]  That's the real issue to keep everybody safe.
[02:09:57.541 --> 02:09:58.502]  Ban that First Amendment.
[02:10:01.004 --> 02:10:02.305]  Let's go to your phone calls here.
[02:10:02.426 --> 02:10:03.707]  Ron in Texas, thanks for holding.
[02:10:03.747 --> 02:10:04.287]  You're a trooper.
[02:10:04.307 --> 02:10:04.728]  Go ahead.
[02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:08.071]  Hey, Alex.
[02:10:08.111 --> 02:10:09.372]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:10:09.893 --> 02:10:11.274]  I'm a big fan.
[02:10:11.734 --> 02:10:12.956]  I listen to your show.
[02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:20.285]  More than I care to admit, my kids sometimes think that I'm a wacko, but you know what?
[02:10:20.745 --> 02:10:21.606]  We are wackos.
[02:10:21.666 --> 02:10:23.847]  We are wackos living in this insane asylum.
[02:10:24.107 --> 02:10:26.169]  It's not normal to go along with this.
[02:10:26.469 --> 02:10:27.109]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:10:28.030 --> 02:10:29.911]  Yeah, no, I hear you.
[02:10:30.011 --> 02:10:31.713]  Listen, first of all, I want to thank you
[02:10:32.413 --> 02:10:34.615]  For being the voice that you are.
[02:10:34.635 --> 02:10:39.959]  I think there needs to be a lot more of you, of us.
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:49.487]  I think that people do need to wake up and be encouraged to, you know, kind of follow suit with what you're doing because we do live in a matrix.
[02:10:49.787 --> 02:11:00.016]  I have to tell you real quickly, I listened when Matt Drudge was on your show and he said something to the tune of creating your own reality within the internet.
[02:11:00.216 --> 02:11:04.197]  You're busy providing for your family and jumping through all the red tape, which is what they've designed to do.
[02:11:04.217 --> 02:11:04.477]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:29.795 --> 02:11:32.377]  Yeah, so you know, I live in Bonham.
[02:11:32.437 --> 02:11:33.958]  I live close to the Red River.
[02:11:34.498 --> 02:11:40.602]  This BLM deal that's going on with that land grab, you know, hits close to home.
[02:11:40.622 --> 02:11:44.064]  And listen, here's what happened yesterday.
[02:11:44.124 --> 02:11:45.946]  So I'm listening to your program.
[02:11:46.826 --> 02:11:47.887]  It's the middle of the day.
[02:11:47.907 --> 02:11:49.448]  I had a day off.
[02:11:49.508 --> 02:11:51.049]  I thought, you know what, I'm going to take a nap.
[02:11:51.799 --> 02:12:08.592]  Uh, like anything, I thought, let me, I just started Googling your name, you know, cause I, I enjoy your show and I'm very intrigued with what you do and, and I thought, well, I'll just get a little bit more information and boom, out of nowhere, I read this article that says that you're a Freemason.
[02:12:08.712 --> 02:12:20.542]  Now, let me, let me first of all say that I haven't met a Freemason that I haven't liked, but, uh, for years I've had a concern
[02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:36.251]  And my mother is married to a Freemason, and this guy is, again, you know, I enjoy his company, but I'm always digging for information and trying to gather things, getting them to slip, so that, you know, I can try to educate myself around things.
[02:12:36.311 --> 02:12:40.734]  But ultimately, the other day, he said, are you ever going to join?
[02:12:41.295 --> 02:12:45.438]  Which really is ironic, because, you know, they don't invite people to.
[02:12:45.478 --> 02:12:48.180]  And I flat out told him, I said, Jesse, here's the deal.
[02:12:48.881 --> 02:12:50.662]  I'm not going to join, and I'll tell you why.
[02:12:52.046 --> 02:13:05.201]  Masons are at the head of every global organization there is, and I've heard and hear that you guys do wonderful things.
[02:13:05.361 --> 02:13:06.322]  I'm sure that you do.
[02:13:06.462 --> 02:13:08.625]  However, how can this world
[02:13:11.106 --> 02:13:18.928]  Well, I think you've made two really great points.
[02:13:19.368 --> 02:13:20.529]  Let me try to respond to those.
[02:13:20.549 --> 02:13:22.049]  We'll put you on hold for a moment.
[02:13:22.549 --> 02:13:25.390]  Come back, let you have a response, then I can go to Tara, John, and others.
[02:13:25.870 --> 02:13:27.431]  First, let me cover the Matt Drudge point.
[02:13:29.761 --> 02:13:31.782]  It takes all sorts of people to beat this thing.
[02:13:32.162 --> 02:13:33.042]  I am being honest.
[02:13:33.182 --> 02:13:34.722]  I'm really acting the way I feel.
[02:13:35.823 --> 02:13:41.084]  I'm embarrassed sometimes I blow up, but quite frankly it's made us successful because it gets people out of their trance.
[02:13:42.904 --> 02:13:44.905]  It turns on more people than it turns them off.
[02:13:45.465 --> 02:13:48.646]  And I don't mind being ridiculed and attacked myself because it doesn't matter.
[02:13:48.706 --> 02:13:49.746]  The message gets out.
[02:13:50.166 --> 02:13:52.687]  People find out about it and the message is there.
[02:13:53.367 --> 02:13:56.028]  People then research it for themselves and find out it's true.
[02:13:58.197 --> 02:14:00.999]  And so then it's separate from Alex being laughed at.
[02:14:01.039 --> 02:14:01.720]  It doesn't matter.
[02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:04.662]  I've carried the message.
[02:14:04.702 --> 02:14:06.023]  I've got it across the goal line.
[02:14:07.624 --> 02:14:13.428]  Now, Drudge talks about creating your own system, your own outlook that comes from the grassroots.
[02:14:13.988 --> 02:14:18.912]  That will then become popular because the establishment narrative is so synthetic and so fake.
[02:14:20.083 --> 02:14:21.264]  People are breaking with it.
[02:14:21.805 --> 02:14:29.352]  So the answer is, don't just believe in drudge, don't just believe in Infowars, don't just believe in WorldNetDaily or whatever it is you're into that's more libertarian conservative.
[02:14:30.133 --> 02:14:31.795]  Go out and create your own system.
[02:14:32.836 --> 02:14:34.758]  The average Democrat's not even a bad person.
[02:14:34.778 --> 02:14:36.039]  They're led by very bad people.
[02:14:36.299 --> 02:14:40.283]  If they went out and created their own system, it'd be a lot better than what the Democrats are putting out.
[02:14:40.684 --> 02:14:41.745]  Be a true individual.
[02:14:43.163 --> 02:14:44.405]  Transmit that message.
[02:14:44.605 --> 02:14:48.089]  Create your own paradigm based on the real reality you see.
[02:14:48.169 --> 02:14:49.070]  Don't be delusional.
[02:14:49.831 --> 02:14:51.373]  Get out of the delusion of the system.
[02:14:51.814 --> 02:14:52.655]  Really research it.
[02:14:54.022 --> 02:14:58.104]  Now I get you say you're not an expert because you're not in the New World Order, you're not a mason, you're not whatever.
[02:14:58.324 --> 02:14:59.144]  You're a real expert.
[02:14:59.184 --> 02:14:59.784]  You're a father.
[02:15:00.064 --> 02:15:00.985]  You're a business person.
[02:15:01.045 --> 02:15:02.025]  You live in the real world.
[02:15:02.485 --> 02:15:13.109]  You're watching the BLM take all these ranchers' land, some of it 60%, some of it 50%, that they've had for 79 years, 104 years, the different families that we've interviewed and had on.
[02:15:13.129 --> 02:15:15.290]  I want to get that latest family on, by the way, guys.
[02:15:16.170 --> 02:15:17.731]  And they're just announcing we're taking your house.
[02:15:19.195 --> 02:15:22.436]  Built 70 plus years ago, and we're taking half your property, thousands of acres.
[02:15:22.837 --> 02:15:28.499]  We're moving, you know, the barrier of the river a mile in.
[02:15:30.140 --> 02:15:30.860]  It's total theft.
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:34.142]  And they're saying every river, every creek, if we want, we're going to just take your property.
[02:15:34.822 --> 02:15:35.802]  It's a precedent setter.
[02:15:36.503 --> 02:15:37.803]  It's part of a UN treaty.
[02:15:38.283 --> 02:15:39.044]  It's UNESCO.
[02:15:39.604 --> 02:15:41.045]  So, what was that guys?
[02:15:42.865 --> 02:15:44.006]  Oh, you do have the BLM video?
[02:15:44.326 --> 02:15:45.266]  Well, everybody knows about it.
[02:15:45.286 --> 02:15:46.687]  I mean, I may play it, but I want to go to calls.
[02:15:46.927 --> 02:15:47.647]  But thanks for reminding me.
[02:15:47.988 --> 02:15:48.568]  They talk in my ear.
[02:15:49.838 --> 02:15:51.999]  Yeah, that was on NBC, Fox News, you name it.
[02:15:52.019 --> 02:15:53.360]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:55.782]  Texas Rancher fights back against BLM land grab.
[02:15:55.982 --> 02:15:57.923]  So yeah, that comes close to home for you.
[02:15:58.303 --> 02:15:59.784]  You're seeing it for yourself.
[02:16:01.245 --> 02:16:02.386]  That's what they did to Cliven Bundy.
[02:16:02.446 --> 02:16:03.766]  He had the rights to his land.
[02:16:03.786 --> 02:16:05.628]  They just said it's not yours and lied to the public.
[02:16:06.288 --> 02:16:08.930]  He had grazing rights, though, for 100 plus years.
[02:16:09.410 --> 02:16:12.272]  This is where they own the actual title and have paid taxes.
[02:16:13.412 --> 02:16:16.834]  So, you get into your whole Mason point next.
[02:16:19.366 --> 02:16:24.590]  You know, I have to probably say that I have major Masonic roots.
[02:16:25.210 --> 02:16:27.692]  I have never been part of a Masonic lodge.
[02:16:28.372 --> 02:16:30.454]  I have never taken Masonic oaths or rituals.
[02:16:31.374 --> 02:16:39.000]  A lot of my family, because Texas was pretty much Masonic through and through, was Masonic, high-level Masonic.
[02:16:39.580 --> 02:16:40.761]  And they were very, very good people.
[02:16:40.781 --> 02:16:42.222]  George Washington was a Mason.
[02:16:42.863 --> 02:16:51.130]  I have been interviewed by major TV shows on History, Discovery Channel, you name it, about my view on Masonic orders.
[02:16:52.972 --> 02:17:05.903]  It really is next to impossible to try to describe Masons and the Masonic orders and the different systems when I've probably read
[02:17:06.755 --> 02:17:07.856]  I don't want to exaggerate.
[02:17:08.297 --> 02:17:10.058]  20 books on it, that's not that much.
[02:17:10.639 --> 02:17:13.322]  And hundreds of white papers and talked to a lot of top masons.
[02:17:13.722 --> 02:17:15.544]  And I know more than most masons do.
[02:17:16.645 --> 02:17:24.153]  Most masons are porch masons and are compartmentalized and don't know really much of anything.
[02:17:24.533 --> 02:17:29.959]  They know about Solomon and basically a bunch of ancient history stuff.
[02:17:31.423 --> 02:17:33.669]  University knowledge was very powerful.
[02:17:33.729 --> 02:17:34.972]  Mathematics was very powerful.
[02:17:34.992 --> 02:17:40.766]  It was associated with magic, with the occult, pre-Christ, pre-Abraham.
[02:17:42.594 --> 02:18:01.050]  So it's the old-time religion, and all it is is a university study of religions, of philosophy, and of building, and of mathematics, and of agrarian systems, because they didn't just bring anybody in to teach them the knowledge of warfare, the knowledge of science, the knowledge of culture.
[02:18:01.631 --> 02:18:05.454]  Universities were called mystery schools, going back to Egypt, basically.
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:15.633]  And so what you see as Masons today is just those schools going on and there have been hundreds of different variants and groups and...
[02:18:16.750 --> 02:18:38.160]  Rosicrucian orders within the Masons and the Illuminati, founded in Germany, was a counter-Illuminati to the real Illuminati that just called itself the Enlightenment, and then Latin Illuminati, but it didn't call itself Sir Francis Bacon, all of that, hundreds of years before the Jesuit priest Adam Weisshaub.
[02:18:38.962 --> 02:18:45.149]  The modern Illuminati was a Catholic spinoff in an attempt to take over the Illuminati and the Rosicrucians.
[02:18:45.970 --> 02:18:53.259]  And yes, undoubtedly my family on both sides of the Mayflower, hardcore Protestants, you could say Rosicrucians.
[02:18:53.719 --> 02:18:58.224]  This country was founded by real Rosicrucians, not the Rosicrucians you see out there today.
[02:18:59.045 --> 02:19:12.396]  And so, undoubtedly, if you want to say it, I mean, I would say I come out of a classical Enlightenment family of what you would call real Illuminati, real Enlightenment.
[02:19:12.736 --> 02:19:14.998]  And I'll just say it here, and everybody asks me who I am, I'll tell you.
[02:19:15.298 --> 02:19:19.561]  There's no secret society, there's no secret messages, there's no secret handshakes.
[02:19:19.922 --> 02:19:20.902]  There's freedom!
[02:19:21.062 --> 02:19:22.243]  There's Jesus Christ!
[02:19:22.544 --> 02:19:23.544]  There's free market!
[02:19:23.584 --> 02:19:24.385]  There's family!
[02:19:24.545 --> 02:19:25.206]  There's strength!
[02:19:25.426 --> 02:19:26.086]  There's honor!
[02:19:26.226 --> 02:19:27.668]  There's the will to fight tyrants!
[02:19:28.228 --> 02:19:29.069]  That's what there is.
[02:19:29.630 --> 02:19:30.692]  The will to fight evil.
[02:19:30.972 --> 02:19:32.694]  The will to build a new civilization.
[02:19:33.155 --> 02:19:33.936]  Built on honor.
[02:19:33.976 --> 02:19:34.838]  Built on trust.
[02:19:35.218 --> 02:19:38.062]  Built on building up a system for all of humanity.
[02:19:39.048 --> 02:19:44.573]  And that secret was not a secret at all, and it made this country special despite all our evils.
[02:19:45.855 --> 02:19:51.260]  The will and the dream to build that new Atlantis was special and was pure.
[02:19:51.861 --> 02:20:01.049]  And now the globalists have hijacked the new Atlantis, and they've used it to take over the world and sell the opposite of what this country was founded on, and it tears my heart out.
[02:20:01.770 --> 02:20:06.360]  So, it's easy for lesser men to write an article claiming I'm in some secret society in a mason.
[02:20:06.841 --> 02:20:08.505]  I'm in the society of humanity.
[02:20:08.645 --> 02:20:09.567]  There are no secrets.
[02:20:10.373 --> 02:20:18.315]  There are hundreds of silver products on the market today, but there's nothing like the astonishing health benefits of the multi-patented One Silver Solution.

[02:21:09.784 --> 02:21:13.285]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:21:14.025 --> 02:21:14.546]  It's true.
[02:21:14.646 --> 02:21:18.587]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:21:18.787 --> 02:21:20.648]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:21:21.188 --> 02:21:25.669]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[02:22:09.674 --> 02:22:12.875]  Young people are supposed to be full of energy and recover quickly from exercise.
[02:22:13.215 --> 02:22:16.436]  Their age should give them a great advantage to feeling good all the time.
[02:22:16.816 --> 02:22:22.438]  However, young people of today are dealing with the same nutrient-deficient food as everyone else in America.
[02:22:22.758 --> 02:22:24.779]  So it does not matter whether you are 15 or 85.
[02:22:24.859 --> 02:22:28.400]  If your biochemistry is off, you cannot feel your best.
[02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:30.740]  Listen to the real-world results of James.

[02:22:32.321 --> 02:22:33.541]  I'm 25 years old.
[02:22:33.561 --> 02:22:36.922]  At the end of a tiring work shift, I used to not do much around the house.
[02:22:37.182 --> 02:22:47.311]  Since I started taking the new Technology Enhance One World Way after work, I have so much energy when I get home that I'm able to take long walks, do chores, and even honey to-do lists from the wife.
[02:22:47.552 --> 02:22:52.056]  It's plenty enough energy to get things done around the house and time to settle down before bedtime.
[02:22:52.276 --> 02:22:56.320]  This whey protein gives me outstanding amount of long-lasting feel-good energy.

[02:24:25.825 --> 02:24:27.086]  I gotta get to this other news.
[02:24:27.126 --> 02:24:30.930]  I got Leanne coming in, David Knight as well, to pop in with some breaking news.
[02:24:32.403 --> 02:24:34.305]  On this hologram situation in China.
[02:24:35.186 --> 02:24:37.389]  In fact, I had that in my stack, but I can't find it.
[02:24:38.310 --> 02:24:39.071]  Here it is, I found it.
[02:24:39.932 --> 02:24:44.037]  So we're going to do that, but Ron, you've got about 30 seconds to respond because I've got to go to Tara, John, and others.
[02:24:44.057 --> 02:24:44.398]  Go ahead.
[02:24:45.925 --> 02:24:50.406]  Real quickly, my mom's Mexican, my dad's Jewish, so Shalom Vato.
[02:24:50.606 --> 02:24:54.648]  I need to know what's going on with the rise in terror in Israel.
[02:24:55.068 --> 02:24:58.129]  I want to know why there's a bias in reporting.
[02:24:59.689 --> 02:25:02.050]  Tell me what's going on and why.
[02:25:02.070 --> 02:25:03.310]  Listen, I appreciate your call, brother.
[02:25:03.330 --> 02:25:04.171]  Let me try to get to that.
[02:25:05.663 --> 02:25:17.791]  You know, you say you're part Jewish, well then, I mean, that's about as Masonic as it gets, because the Jews picked all that up from Egypt and Greece and places, and all it is is the study of ancient religions and science.
[02:25:18.231 --> 02:25:20.632]  So it's as varied as universities are in the world.
[02:25:20.652 --> 02:25:22.574]  I mean, that's really all the Masons are.
[02:25:23.464 --> 02:25:27.048]  And mostly the Masons have had their organizations taken over by globalists.
[02:25:27.348 --> 02:25:29.550]  So yeah, there are a lot of top Masons that are New World Order.
[02:25:29.971 --> 02:25:34.335]  George Washington wrote about the Illuminati trying to take over the Masonic Order in the United States and Europe.
[02:25:34.455 --> 02:25:34.996]  Read his letters.
[02:25:37.714 --> 02:25:39.256]  You can say bad stuff about Israel.
[02:25:39.316 --> 02:25:40.438]  Israel's done some bad things.
[02:25:41.099 --> 02:25:44.584]  But separately, none of the Arab nations take any of the, quote, Palestinians.
[02:25:44.904 --> 02:25:46.426]  Most of them aren't even from that area.
[02:25:46.446 --> 02:25:47.308]  They're from other areas.
[02:25:47.708 --> 02:25:49.230]  It's used as a political football.
[02:25:49.851 --> 02:25:53.917]  There is a massive worldwide jihad being funded right now.
[02:25:55.057 --> 02:26:01.198]  And so you're going to have these attacks in Israel and you're going to have attacks here because that's what's being basically funded.
[02:26:01.719 --> 02:26:06.060]  It's a global destabilization program being launched by the globalists.
[02:26:06.860 --> 02:26:09.960]  And the Palestinians do live in horrible conditions and they're getting mad.
[02:26:10.501 --> 02:26:12.121]  You can see it from people's perspectives.
[02:26:12.561 --> 02:26:16.462]  The point is, you get above it, the globalists are playing different groups off against each other.
[02:26:17.062 --> 02:26:20.223]  Let's go, thank you Ron, let's go to Tara in Tennessee.
[02:26:20.303 --> 02:26:20.983]  Thanks for holding.
[02:26:25.267 --> 02:26:29.729]  Listening on 94.3 WNFZ, Tara or Tara, go ahead.
[02:26:30.369 --> 02:26:31.129]  It's Tara.
[02:26:31.370 --> 02:26:42.954]  Um, yeah, I was actually just calling about, um, a new story that actually came over the UK Daily Mail about, um, his name is Sergeant Dillard Johnson.
[02:26:42.994 --> 02:26:47.936]  He wrote a book called Carnivore about his, uh, time in the Iraq war.
[02:26:48.237 --> 02:26:50.237]  And my husband is actually in this book.
[02:26:50.317 --> 02:26:51.378]  He is now a
[02:26:52.370 --> 02:26:54.851]  Number two ISIS target.
[02:26:55.511 --> 02:26:55.851]  Wow.
[02:26:55.931 --> 02:26:57.312]  Sergeant Johnson, that is.
[02:26:58.032 --> 02:27:06.195]  And yet we have gotten no communication from anyone saying, hey, you might want to be watching out.
[02:27:06.375 --> 02:27:07.996]  Hey, this is what's going on.
[02:27:08.556 --> 02:27:11.517]  And I mean, I know why, but I just want to know why.
[02:27:11.537 --> 02:27:18.240]  I mean, essentially everyone in this book who he mentioned quite often are targets now.
[02:27:19.731 --> 02:27:20.412]  Sure, Tara.
[02:27:20.432 --> 02:27:21.692]  I'm sorry for getting your name wrong.
[02:27:21.732 --> 02:27:23.213]  It's way across the room, the screen today.
[02:27:24.454 --> 02:27:27.236]  Absolutely, there are real ISIS fighters in Europe and the United States.
[02:27:27.736 --> 02:27:31.278]  They've been having their minions attack recruiting centers and things, as you know.
[02:27:32.279 --> 02:27:34.060]  And because it's a real terror threat,
[02:27:35.216 --> 02:27:39.479]  They're just hanging the military and targets out to dry and it's truly despicable.
[02:27:40.020 --> 02:27:46.085]  I've had family that's had Mexican drug cartels send them threatening stuff to their mailbox with photos of them.
[02:27:47.185 --> 02:27:52.530]  So that's how infiltrated this country is and how serious the situation has gotten.
[02:27:54.875 --> 02:27:55.416]  Honestly, I don't know.
[02:27:55.436 --> 02:27:56.436]  I mean, it's making, it scares me.
[02:28:21.412 --> 02:28:24.254]  I don't know what to do.
[02:28:25.455 --> 02:28:27.877]  Nobody's telling us anything.
[02:28:27.897 --> 02:28:29.739]  I've asked my husband.
[02:28:29.759 --> 02:28:34.083]  I came home from work one day and he was like, let's go outside.
[02:28:34.103 --> 02:28:36.025]  And he tells me what's going on.
[02:28:36.085 --> 02:28:38.927]  And he's like, I've contacted my family.
[02:28:38.948 --> 02:28:40.409]  You need to contact yours.
[02:28:41.395 --> 02:28:43.357]  And, you know, just be careful.
[02:28:43.377 --> 02:28:46.799]  Watch around you, and, you know, that's all we can do.
[02:28:46.919 --> 02:29:06.755]  Well, you can also, in most states, and certainly for an issue like that, they can suppress your address and your name, and there's other ways to do that, but if you're really concerned, and I think compared to driving down the highway, it's a low threat, because even though there are probably undoubtedly hundreds of ISIS in the country, they've got a lot of targets, and they'll usually hit soft targets, and so
[02:29:08.126 --> 02:29:16.429]  I'm not the total expert, I can't tell you definitively, but we've had ISIS threaten us, put bigs in their videos saying they're going to get him.
[02:29:16.749 --> 02:29:22.691]  He's been down to cover their bases, found a weird mosque down right where the FBI told Judicial Watch it was at.
[02:29:23.011 --> 02:29:25.232]  The FBI came and debriefed him.
[02:29:25.532 --> 02:29:26.732]  ISIS has said they're going to get me.
[02:29:26.812 --> 02:29:28.513]  Well, good, line up then.
[02:29:29.273 --> 02:29:32.996]  I'm not taunting ISIS to come get me, but at the same time, whatever.
[02:29:33.016 --> 02:29:35.378]  I mean, you know, they got their God, I got mine.
[02:29:36.099 --> 02:29:42.064]  Their God's got big red horns and a little black tail, and mine doesn't, so I don't chop Christians' heads off or Muslims' heads off or anybody.
[02:29:42.524 --> 02:29:46.808]  So I'm not scared of them, I'm not scared of the new world order, and I think you're going to be fine, Tara.
[02:29:47.348 --> 02:29:54.833]  Uh, overall, but there is some precautions you should take, and I'd carry a firearm, so at least, uh, you'll give as good as you get if they try something on you.
[02:29:55.114 --> 02:29:57.395]  But I think it's your husband that's probably gonna be the real target.
[02:29:57.695 --> 02:29:58.236]  God bless you.
[02:29:58.276 --> 02:29:58.896]  Send us some info.
[02:29:58.916 --> 02:29:59.897]  I'd like to interview your husband.
[02:30:10.285 --> 02:30:12.606]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[02:30:12.886 --> 02:30:17.989]  Ammo control picks up stream among Democrats aiming to limit gun access.
[02:30:18.249 --> 02:30:20.350]  Article up at InfoWars.com.
[02:30:20.470 --> 02:30:39.080]  With 300 million firearms in circulation and calls for more restrictions hitting a wall, Democrats and gun control advocates from California to Virginia are increasingly turning to other proposals such as restricting ammunition, magazine rounds, and narrowing the ability to wield weapons.
[02:30:39.480 --> 02:30:53.563]  California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, who is running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 2018, released a statewide ballot campaign Thursday to require background checks for ammunition purchases.
[02:30:53.923 --> 02:30:58.804]  Why is it that we have background checks for guns, but not background checks for ammunition?
[02:30:58.944 --> 02:31:02.065]  It makes no sense, Mr. Newsom said at his press conference.
[02:31:02.245 --> 02:31:04.845]  Well, because it's ammunition, you a** clown!
[02:31:05.245 --> 02:31:08.266]  You can find more articles like this at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:10.057 --> 02:31:14.162]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[02:31:14.362 --> 02:31:18.587]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[02:31:18.627 --> 02:31:25.915]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[02:31:26.075 --> 02:31:36.579]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[02:31:36.739 --> 02:31:40.080]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[02:31:40.260 --> 02:31:41.281]  What do you have to lose?
[02:31:41.401 --> 02:31:49.684]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[02:31:49.824 --> 02:31:53.026]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[02:31:53.126 --> 02:31:57.168]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[02:31:57.328 --> 02:31:59.449]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[02:31:59.649 --> 02:32:06.613]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.

[02:33:10.902 --> 02:33:17.129]  You know, the last time this played, I sang to it.
[02:33:21.676 --> 02:33:26.799]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:27.320 --> 02:33:29.401]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:51.776 --> 02:34:01.522]  Two Chinese TV reports, got it on video, and they believe it's probably a hologram of some type, Project Blue Beam type stuff.
[02:34:01.562 --> 02:34:03.343]  I mean, the news is getting crazier and crazier.
[02:34:03.983 --> 02:34:16.970]  Also, mainstream news reported earlier this week, well, NASA did, and they're getting steady to aim at it with radio telescopes, but with visual telescopes, a star that appears to have big space stations built around it.
[02:34:17.530 --> 02:34:20.092]  So, they've never seen anything like it before.
[02:34:21.784 --> 02:34:30.509]  I just wonder if the parallel universe, the floating city, if like if you buy some weird beans and plant them, the bean stalk grows up and that's where you find the free health care?
[02:34:30.529 --> 02:34:30.849]  Yeah.
[02:34:31.169 --> 02:34:35.912]  Is if you go up there and then Captain America's there and everything else is fine.
[02:34:36.612 --> 02:34:39.574]  And of course that's also that's where 2 plus 2 equals 5 land.
[02:34:39.794 --> 02:34:40.214]  It is.
[02:34:40.274 --> 02:34:42.996]  So we're gonna be talking with you about that briefly here in just a moment.
[02:34:43.456 --> 02:34:50.242]  And then of course the nightly news is tonight at 7 o'clock central and hopefully I'll be back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:34:50.262 --> 02:34:50.642]  central.
[02:34:50.662 --> 02:34:56.187]  I will be hosting that show but I never take it for granted that we're still on the air with all the censorship going on.
[02:34:56.487 --> 02:34:58.689]  But Liam before we go to David Knight just briefly and then come back to you.
[02:34:59.889 --> 02:35:03.970]  I don't know if you knew a year and a half ago they had me in there working with Red Skull to hurt the immigrants.
[02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:06.271]  I only remembered that and they had a copy in the office.
[02:35:06.291 --> 02:35:07.812]  I've forgotten so I can actually show people that.
[02:35:07.832 --> 02:35:18.976]  It sounds crazy to go, yeah, I'm one of Red Skull's accomplices now, but they have the Tea Party out basically attacking the poor immigrants and the black Captain America takes out the evil white people.
[02:35:19.396 --> 02:35:24.538]  I mean, this is getting a little over the top, but maybe it's true.
[02:35:25.018 --> 02:35:27.179]  Maybe actually we are with Red Skull.
[02:35:27.199 --> 02:35:28.259]  Did you ever think you were with Red Skull?
[02:35:29.059 --> 02:35:29.880]  I was not aware.
[02:35:29.900 --> 02:35:33.782]  I always thought I was using my powers for good, but you know.
[02:35:33.922 --> 02:35:34.942]  I thought you were with Wonder Woman.
[02:35:35.102 --> 02:35:35.403]  I know.
[02:35:35.783 --> 02:35:37.424]  I'm here to fight evil.
[02:35:37.524 --> 02:35:40.765]  I did not realize I'm actually helping evil along.
[02:35:40.785 --> 02:35:45.188]  In fact, guys, can you queue up Wonder Woman again as we talk today, but I'm going to let her exit during the Wonder Woman.
[02:35:45.548 --> 02:35:49.290]  By the way, Leigh-Anne normally is wearing rock and roll t-shirts when she's dressed up on TV.
[02:35:49.330 --> 02:35:54.913]  She's wearing a news outfit, but this is her normal garb, a classic Van Halen shirt.
[02:35:55.493 --> 02:36:00.677]  And actually, I got that at that tour when I was like 10 years old, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:00.697 --> 02:36:02.959]  10 years old, I actually had that exact shirt.
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:05.201]  But I know you're just a trendiet.
[02:36:05.221 --> 02:36:06.742]  You got it at a vintage shop or something.
[02:36:06.882 --> 02:36:07.082]  Yep.
[02:36:07.343 --> 02:36:08.764]  Or did you actually get it at this thing or two?
[02:36:09.084 --> 02:36:11.086]  I was two years old and I was at the concert.
[02:36:12.567 --> 02:36:15.869]  Seriously though, maybe Wonder Woman's a little racist.
[02:36:16.430 --> 02:36:16.930]  Probably.
[02:36:17.811 --> 02:36:19.772]  She was probably fighting evil all along.
[02:36:20.133 --> 02:36:22.415]  Well, we probably need a black Wonder Woman to chop her head off.
[02:36:22.595 --> 02:36:22.795]  Right.
[02:36:24.085 --> 02:36:26.306]  Or a transgender Wonder Woman.
[02:36:26.326 --> 02:36:26.786]  That's it!
[02:36:26.906 --> 02:36:28.007]  A Wonder Woman!
[02:36:28.487 --> 02:36:30.408]  And it could be like Jenner.
[02:36:31.268 --> 02:36:33.890]  Just incredibly, incredible courage and stunning.
[02:36:34.370 --> 02:36:37.331]  Even if he looks like dead celery or something.
[02:36:37.351 --> 02:36:39.612]  I'm supposed to think it's the hottest thing I've ever seen in my life, Leigh-Anne.
[02:36:39.792 --> 02:36:42.254]  Suspend your disbelief, just like you believe.
[02:36:42.274 --> 02:36:51.378]  Leigh-Anne, how does it feel, like mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all, and it says, you are beautiful, my queen, but not as beautiful as Caitlyn Jenner.
[02:36:52.435 --> 02:36:53.556]  Well, you should just accept it.
[02:36:53.576 --> 02:36:55.618]  Are you going to send the Huntsman after Jenner?
[02:36:56.539 --> 02:37:03.425]  You know, we were talking about this the other day, and I don't, I don't mind, you know, if that's how you want to identify, I will honor that.
[02:37:03.445 --> 02:37:04.806]  But you gotta worship it!
[02:37:05.047 --> 02:37:05.387]  No!
[02:37:05.767 --> 02:37:07.389]  Worship it now!
[02:37:07.509 --> 02:37:08.610]  I will worship it!
[02:37:08.670 --> 02:37:10.592]  Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo!
[02:37:10.752 --> 02:37:11.272]  Hold on!
[02:37:11.312 --> 02:37:14.475]  Check your, check your, check your white male privilege!
[02:37:14.756 --> 02:37:15.857]  Woo, woo, woo, woo!
[02:37:18.516 --> 02:37:19.196]  You're privileged.
[02:37:19.256 --> 02:37:20.317]  Check your privilege.
[02:37:20.577 --> 02:37:21.898]  But, but, okay, so fine.
[02:37:22.138 --> 02:37:27.221]  I will worship and honor you, but must I also suspend my belief?
[02:37:27.501 --> 02:37:28.141]  Suspend my reality?
[02:37:28.161 --> 02:37:31.563]  But why didn't they get a good-looking tranny to be their spokesperson?
[02:37:33.024 --> 02:37:35.025]  Looks like shriveled-up peanut ribble or something.
[02:37:37.165 --> 02:37:42.288]  Well, no, I mean, I'm not bashing anybody, but I've seen on TV before they go, that's a woman?
[02:37:42.308 --> 02:37:43.329]  I mean, that's a man?
[02:37:43.369 --> 02:37:44.230]  That looks like a woman.
[02:37:44.490 --> 02:37:46.511]  But Jenner doesn't even look like a woman.
[02:37:46.991 --> 02:37:49.053]  Looks like a possum with a wig on.
[02:37:49.873 --> 02:37:52.075]  Well, you must not have seen her bikini photos.
[02:37:53.556 --> 02:37:54.296]  Oh yeah, I saw it.
[02:37:55.097 --> 02:37:58.359]  Photos released of Jenner topless and it's really just him at the beach as a guy.
[02:38:00.131 --> 02:38:00.892]  All right, I apologize.
[02:38:00.952 --> 02:38:02.753]  I'm going to leave and we're going to come back.
[02:38:03.033 --> 02:38:04.254]  David Knight is a little more serious.
[02:38:04.274 --> 02:38:05.655]  That's why I have him hosting The Fourth Hour.
[02:38:05.675 --> 02:38:06.876]  Doing a great job.
[02:38:07.256 --> 02:38:09.397]  He's been here now about three and a half years with his family.
[02:38:09.417 --> 02:38:10.478]  Moved down here from North Carolina.
[02:38:11.078 --> 02:38:14.541]  And David, what do you think just about the general insanity of the world?
[02:38:14.741 --> 02:38:21.385]  There are clearly just 300, 400 percent increases in demonization of the Tea Party and Patriots this year.
[02:38:21.986 --> 02:38:26.228]  And then now they're launching this domestic anti-terror force, saying we're about to blow stuff up any minute.
[02:38:26.268 --> 02:38:29.771]  I mean, it's pretty obvious they're getting ready to pull off a new Oklahoma City, in my view.
[02:38:30.471 --> 02:38:34.232]  Yeah, Alex, you know, you're talking about this Captain America situation.
[02:38:34.672 --> 02:38:38.613]  Their propaganda has really become very cartoonish for quite some time, actually.
[02:38:38.633 --> 02:38:53.277]  And they've been doing this a very long time, just as we were talking about the other day, going all the way back to the very beginning of civil asset forfeiture, where they encouraged the police to fund their departments by seizing the property of people who were not convicted, not even charged with a crime,
[02:38:53.797 --> 02:39:09.337]  At the same time they passed that bill, Alex, that was 1984, fall of 1984, they began Miami Vice, where they talked about how cool it was that the police could drive around in these exotic boats, these exotic cars, fueling both sides of this insane war on drugs.
[02:39:09.357 --> 02:39:09.597]  That's it.
[02:39:09.617 --> 02:39:10.117]  Formature seizure.
[02:39:10.658 --> 02:39:12.059]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[02:39:12.419 --> 02:39:13.840]  And now people are starting to move back.
[02:39:13.860 --> 02:39:20.423]  You know, we've got an article today on Infowars.com, the growing bipartisan consensus to roll back the failed war on drugs.
[02:39:20.443 --> 02:39:26.426]  Well, it's not only failed from a pragmatic standpoint, but it never had any constitutional authority to begin with.
[02:39:26.446 --> 02:39:36.472]  We're going to talk a little bit about that, but also when you're talking about these floating cities, there's technology that is out there as we learned that interview that you had with Annie Jacobson about the Pentagon's brain.
[02:39:37.432 --> 02:39:43.374]  Talking about how, going back to the Vietnam War, they had drones that they were using in Vietnam.
[02:39:43.494 --> 02:39:59.240]  And of course we know about Operation Northwoods, where they had wanted to use commercial airlines to hit buildings and have terrorist attacks on shopping centers so they could portray Cuba as a terrorist organization and create an American invasion of Cuba.
[02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:00.321]  Sounds very familiar, doesn't it?
[02:40:00.421 --> 02:40:03.042]  That was in the 1960s, along with these early drones.
[02:40:03.562 --> 02:40:05.503]  So we've learned about this over the years.
[02:40:05.583 --> 02:40:06.964]  Gradually they've rolled this out.
[02:40:07.024 --> 02:40:12.388]  We had a leak of classified documents come out yesterday from the same people that gave us these Snowden leaks.
[02:40:12.828 --> 02:40:14.790]  They're talking about this being a second Snowden.
[02:40:15.310 --> 02:40:24.136]  And in many ways it is, because just as Snowden was exposing information that NSA whistleblowers had put out there a decade earlier, he produced some documents.
[02:40:24.416 --> 02:40:30.940]  These are some documents that, again, repeat what we have known about these drone assassination programs for quite some time.
[02:40:31.381 --> 02:40:33.422]  But they don't tell people what were at the
[02:40:34.003 --> 02:40:44.212]  And I think one of the things that really illustrates this as an allegory is the fact that Tesla cars became autonomous overnight with just a software update yesterday.
[02:40:45.032 --> 02:40:46.974]  And that is what we're seeing here.
[02:40:47.014 --> 02:40:53.720]  They put all the pieces in place, they test all the pieces, and then it's just a real quick flip of a switch.
[02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:55.361]  That's the headline.
[02:40:55.381 --> 02:40:57.563]  Did Tesla just go Terminator or Skynet?
[02:40:57.724 --> 02:40:57.904]  Yes.
[02:40:58.164 --> 02:41:00.046]  And people think, oh, you're just getting it for the movie.
[02:41:00.626 --> 02:41:05.387]  I've seen Pentagon documents in my book where in the 70s they called it Skynet or SkyGrid.
[02:41:05.567 --> 02:41:05.807]  Yes.
[02:41:06.127 --> 02:41:09.087]  I mean, the movie is imitating reality.
[02:41:09.388 --> 02:41:11.608]  Oh, and it's not even, there's not even any question about that.
[02:41:11.668 --> 02:41:17.789]  Popular Science loves to talk about all this technology coming from the Defense Department, especially DARPA.
[02:41:17.809 --> 02:41:21.830]  They love to talk about it in a gee whiz, it's always benevolent context.
[02:41:22.250 --> 02:41:24.910]  And that was the very beginning of the article.
[02:41:24.950 --> 02:41:29.711]  The rise of machines has begun, fittingly with an overnight wireless global awakening.
[02:41:30.271 --> 02:41:32.012]  And so they're very well aware.
[02:41:32.032 --> 02:41:33.653]  Oh, the machines have an awakening!
[02:41:33.673 --> 02:41:37.134]  So you're going to be covering that in the fourth hour and more.
[02:41:37.214 --> 02:41:38.435]  Great job, David Knight.
[02:41:38.815 --> 02:41:41.316]  And, of course, who's hosting the Nightly News tonight at 7 o'clock Central?
[02:41:41.696 --> 02:41:43.037]  That'll be myself, LeeAnne Mack.
[02:41:43.197 --> 02:41:44.878]  That'll be Wonder Woman.
[02:41:44.978 --> 02:41:46.418]  All the world is waiting for her.
[02:41:46.778 --> 02:41:48.019]  Thank you so much, David Knight.
[02:41:48.059 --> 02:41:50.620]  We'll be watching and listening to you in the fourth hour.
[02:41:51.441 --> 02:41:51.801]  Thank you.
[02:41:51.821 --> 02:41:53.762]  I want to thank all of our affiliates for picking up the show.
[02:41:53.782 --> 02:41:56.183]  I know a lot of stations are picking up the fourth hour.
[02:41:56.203 --> 02:41:57.763]  I want to thank you for doing that.
[02:41:57.923 --> 02:41:58.864]  I co-hosted a lot.
[02:41:59.304 --> 02:42:04.512]  David Knight, Jakari Jackson, Rob Dew, Leanne McAdoo, and others.
[02:42:04.773 --> 02:42:10.221]  And as time goes on, we will, over the years, add more and more counter-programming here on air.
[02:42:10.522 --> 02:42:11.944]  Leanne, getting into the Parallel Universe.
[02:42:12.697 --> 02:42:20.885]  Right, so this is a parallel universe, hundreds of people, well actually thousands of residents in two different areas in China reported seeing this.
[02:42:20.985 --> 02:42:23.467]  It was reported in the Chinese media there.
[02:42:23.927 --> 02:42:25.589]  Did parallel universe open up?
[02:42:25.729 --> 02:42:29.532]  Hundreds see floating city filmed in the skies above China.
[02:42:30.433 --> 02:42:40.980]  And so they're called their weather experts are saying that this phenomenon is it's an illusion called Fata Morgana, which is they say it can be seen on land or sea.
[02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:51.067]  It involves the optical distortion and inversion of distant objects such as boats, which will appear stacked like skyscrapers because the rays of light will bend.
[02:42:51.507 --> 02:42:53.949]  But this is clearly a city.
[02:42:54.269 --> 02:42:56.170]  It's not a boat, a stack of boat.
[02:42:56.190 --> 02:42:59.573]  And then there's another video as well, where it's a really intricate
[02:43:00.353 --> 02:43:02.737]  A detailed phantom city floating over China.
[02:43:02.757 --> 02:43:05.821]  So of course the internet has gone ablaze.
[02:43:05.841 --> 02:43:09.126]  They're wondering, is this a Project Bluebeam test?
[02:43:09.406 --> 02:43:10.047]  Something like that?
[02:43:12.166 --> 02:43:21.672]  China, they say, with all the technological achievements that they have, are they using it, setting up some kind of holographic thing to see the response from the public there?
[02:43:21.993 --> 02:43:32.340]  Well, the dead giveaway of this spectacular footage is that you notice it's in key low-lying thick clouds.
[02:43:32.540 --> 02:43:35.081]  And this has happened in Mexico City where flying saucers are seen.
[02:43:35.482 --> 02:43:38.243]  This has happened out in Arizona when they have low-level fog.
[02:43:39.264 --> 02:43:47.152]  And then they see lights in the hills, and then they see these flying saucers or buildings show up, and it is declassified partially.
[02:43:47.172 --> 02:43:55.720]  I remember DARPA years ago was like in Popular Mechanics, he was mentioning that in Popular Science had articles about the Pentagon admits they've got secret programs with high-powered
[02:43:57.446 --> 02:44:06.252]  Systems to be able to project a 500-yard tall Buddha or Jesus, flying saucers, whatever they want, but they need cloud cover.
[02:44:06.312 --> 02:44:08.794]  They need the right type of atmospherics to do it really big.
[02:44:09.414 --> 02:44:15.298]  I mean, in the 50s, they had Disneyland, and I went there before they upgraded it when I was a kid in the 70s or early 80s.
[02:44:15.558 --> 02:44:17.640]  They had ghosts flying around, you know, in the haunted house.
[02:44:17.680 --> 02:44:18.220]  It looked real.
[02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:19.481]  I was like, you know, 10 years old.
[02:44:19.501 --> 02:44:20.441]  I was like, man, that's really scary.
[02:44:20.461 --> 02:44:21.742]  It was like a ghost through the wall.
[02:44:22.103 --> 02:44:25.725]  And those were just little, you know, holograms, three different projectors together, 1950s technology.
[02:44:28.167 --> 02:44:33.371]  We know in the first Iraq war they sprayed hallucinogens on the Iraqi army.
[02:44:33.772 --> 02:44:35.093]  They were just conscripts anyways.
[02:44:35.153 --> 02:44:36.314]  A lot nicer than killing them.
[02:44:37.055 --> 02:44:41.318]  Of course they dropped B-52 bombs on them too, as I guess they did, as part of the psychological op.
[02:44:41.599 --> 02:44:47.444]  Hit them with different biological, excuse me, chemicals and then did project some really wild
[02:44:48.024 --> 02:44:48.505]  Uh, stuff.
[02:44:48.625 --> 02:44:49.906]  Muhammad, Jesus, you name it.
[02:44:50.306 --> 02:44:51.287]  End of the world stuff.
[02:44:51.827 --> 02:44:53.669]  Uh, super ships, flying saucers.
[02:44:54.069 --> 02:44:56.852]  So people just panicking about, hey man, I just saw flying saucers.
[02:44:56.892 --> 02:44:57.092]  Right.
[02:44:57.352 --> 02:44:57.973]  I'm giving up.
[02:44:58.473 --> 02:45:03.157]  And really it's three jumbo jets up, projecting it down on the ground, and they're up at 30,000 feet.
[02:45:04.591 --> 02:45:09.834]  But a lot of times, this happens in big cities too, because they've got projectors in buildings.
[02:45:10.635 --> 02:45:12.076]  And then they're just testing the public.
[02:45:12.116 --> 02:45:13.937]  See, the globalists are scientists.
[02:45:14.237 --> 02:45:15.438]  They test what's in the water.
[02:45:15.498 --> 02:45:16.638]  They test the GMO.
[02:45:16.939 --> 02:45:17.979]  They test communism.
[02:45:17.999 --> 02:45:19.100]  They test Nazism.
[02:45:19.540 --> 02:45:22.022]  They test, you know, different organizations.
[02:45:22.682 --> 02:45:28.524]  Different groups, different movements to try to develop the best program to control people.
[02:45:28.584 --> 02:45:33.305]  We're saying elevate yourself to the level that they've been so arrogant, most of this is admitted.
[02:45:33.945 --> 02:45:35.246]  Geoengineering, you name it.
[02:45:35.746 --> 02:45:45.729]  And so you can get to the level of engineering your own views by the real research, not having them engineer you, and you can be at the technocrat level, but use it against them.
[02:45:46.249 --> 02:45:48.470]  Their arrogance will be their downfall, Leigh-Anne.
[02:45:48.810 --> 02:45:51.891]  Well, and so what do you think about this, this Project Blue Beam?
[02:45:51.911 --> 02:45:57.133]  I believe it was like Reagan said, how great it would be if we had some sort of an alien invasion.
[02:45:57.153 --> 02:46:00.434]  Do you think they're testing out some type of a scenario like that for the future?
[02:46:00.554 --> 02:46:04.655]  The Vatican's warning us about, oh, soon we're going to meet our alien cousins.
[02:46:04.695 --> 02:46:05.095]  Exactly.
[02:46:05.215 --> 02:46:06.456]  In fact, I'm glad you brought that up.
[02:46:06.496 --> 02:46:07.156]  I forgot about that.
[02:46:07.216 --> 02:46:09.617]  Gorbachev, Reagan, Jimmy Carter.
[02:46:09.677 --> 02:46:12.238]  I mean, the amount of world leaders, heads of NASA.
[02:46:13.918 --> 02:46:15.099]  I've talked to multiple
[02:46:15.939 --> 02:46:21.403]  High-level astronauts off-air that said they saw flying saucers, they saw spaceships, they saw space bases.
[02:46:21.803 --> 02:46:26.486]  A lot of famous astronauts, Edgar Mitchell's on record, saying, you know, they were followed around constantly by them.
[02:46:26.846 --> 02:46:38.214]  And then I've interviewed Buzz Aldrin on air, and he started just going, well, you know, the folks that built the paramedics built the base on the moon of Mars, and there's a real obelisk, and that's 2001, but that's classified, I can't get into it, I mean.
[02:46:38.254 --> 02:46:41.016]  And then one time, I'm not gonna, it's just, the point is, is that
[02:46:42.245 --> 02:46:46.828]  Are these guys planning psyops on us, or do they really see flying saucers?
[02:46:47.048 --> 02:46:58.196]  Well, and that's the thing is, you know, obviously in the Bible it talks about the second coming of Christ and all of that, so what if they were to create some type of scenario like that where people say, oh wow, you know...
[02:46:58.516 --> 02:47:09.778]  Well, they talk about everyone seeing the beast and the machine that's with the beast in Revelations, and pull up the actual passage, and then in Jerusalem there is a machine that speaks for the beast, that's worshipped, that everyone can see.
[02:47:09.798 --> 02:47:19.620]  And it describes this huge being that is the beast, but is the facsimile of the beast, and that it can be seen worldwide.
[02:47:19.900 --> 02:47:20.660]  Right.
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:25.001]  And here they are, testing this technology with these floating cities, and just telling everyone,
[02:47:27.015 --> 02:47:28.556]  It's a boat flipped upside down.
[02:47:28.596 --> 02:47:32.459]  And no, there's no chemtrails, there's just tens of thousands of documents admitting geoengineering.
[02:47:32.739 --> 02:47:32.899]  Right.
[02:47:32.919 --> 02:47:37.943]  So they don't want anyone to be aware of it until they're ready to launch the project.
[02:47:39.144 --> 02:47:51.532]  It is crazy, because you watch that video that's shot by multiple news agencies, and it's either staged by the government through the news agency and is fake, but all these witnesses say they saw it, or it's a giant hologram.
[02:47:51.772 --> 02:47:53.133]  That is not some anomaly.
[02:47:54.034 --> 02:47:54.214]  Right.
[02:47:55.683 --> 02:48:00.690]  And this is, in 2011 this happened, I mean this has happened multiple times.
[02:48:00.730 --> 02:48:07.620]  I mean obviously we know in a lot of cities there in China they do have major issues with pollution, so of course that can bend the light.
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:11.365]  But this is a city, it's a fully formed city, you know.
[02:48:12.065 --> 02:48:13.526]  Why are you being a conspiracy theorist?
[02:48:13.786 --> 02:48:17.428]  Leanne, you're not allowed to look at something and say what you think it is.
[02:48:17.648 --> 02:48:21.330]  If Obama says that there's nothing there, there's nothing there, okay?
[02:48:21.630 --> 02:48:24.912]  Leanne, there is not a... May I see that Clark's pen, please?
[02:48:25.832 --> 02:48:28.033]  Clark's is not an incredible seafood place here in Austin.
[02:48:28.174 --> 02:48:29.814]  A little too expensive, but I go there sometimes.
[02:48:30.755 --> 02:48:31.936]  This is not a Clark's pen, okay?
[02:48:31.956 --> 02:48:32.436]  It's not yellow.
[02:48:33.848 --> 02:48:34.708]  It's not canary yellow.
[02:48:35.049 --> 02:48:35.649]  It doesn't exist.
[02:48:35.689 --> 02:48:36.649]  Now, I said so.
[02:48:36.789 --> 02:48:37.150]  Gaslighting.
[02:48:37.170 --> 02:48:38.670]  I'm going to gaslight you right now.
[02:48:39.811 --> 02:48:42.052]  You're racist if you don't say... This pen is blue.
[02:48:42.212 --> 02:48:42.993]  It's a purple penguin.
[02:48:43.473 --> 02:48:44.313]  It's a purple penguin.
[02:48:44.353 --> 02:48:44.994]  It's not yellow.
[02:48:45.474 --> 02:48:46.634]  Tell me it's blue or you're racist.
[02:48:47.255 --> 02:48:47.875]  It is blue.
[02:48:48.755 --> 02:48:49.016]  Good.
[02:48:49.316 --> 02:48:50.116]  Now you're reasonable.
[02:48:50.156 --> 02:48:50.456]  Thank you.
[02:48:51.077 --> 02:48:52.097]  Leanne, thank you so much.
[02:48:52.117 --> 02:48:53.138]  We'll see you on the Nightly News tonight.
[02:48:53.998 --> 02:48:54.318]  Yay!
[02:48:54.478 --> 02:48:55.559]  Yay, Leanne!
[02:48:55.919 --> 02:48:58.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to Truth Raider.
[02:48:58.180 --> 02:48:59.441]  Truth Raider, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:49:02.984 --> 02:49:11.348]  I know they have to hold a while, so when I finally go to them, they've got to wait 10 seconds on the internet or the station they're listening to to realize they're on air.
[02:49:11.688 --> 02:49:12.769]  Yes, Truth Raider, go ahead.
[02:49:13.529 --> 02:49:15.470]  Yeah, I'm enjoying my X2 here.
[02:49:16.431 --> 02:49:18.452]  It's keeping me awake and angry!
[02:49:22.634 --> 02:49:26.996]  Hey, I wanted to tell the Info Warriors out there about a very good documentary.
[02:49:27.842 --> 02:49:33.066]  That your buddy Tex Mars and Pastor Steven Anderson had put together.
[02:49:33.867 --> 02:49:35.848]  It's called Marching to Zion.
[02:49:35.868 --> 02:49:44.475]  It'll give you a comprehensive look at who the bankers are and who are orchestrating everything in our reality.
[02:49:45.156 --> 02:49:46.216]  Our divide and conquer.
[02:49:47.077 --> 02:49:48.598]  Everything you want to know.
[02:49:48.618 --> 02:49:49.779]  It's in that documentary.
[02:49:49.799 --> 02:49:51.921]  So are you saying Zionists run everything?
[02:49:53.782 --> 02:49:55.684]  No, there's what, 1%, 1% or 2% in the whole world?
[02:49:57.674 --> 02:50:05.197]  No, they have to be 98% of the Gentile Zionists that have to collaborate in order to make this work.
[02:50:07.178 --> 02:50:08.698]  You have to have people that sell out.
[02:50:11.119 --> 02:50:12.060]  It's all about the big money.
[02:50:12.700 --> 02:50:16.962]  Well, I've never had Jews show up and say, sell out to them.
[02:50:17.582 --> 02:50:22.904]  And I've also seen the power of, and Jews are pretty diverse groups of people in my experience, different views, different political ideas.
[02:50:24.335 --> 02:50:29.580]  I mean, people told me that I'm supposedly Jewish because I'm successful, or that Leanne's Jewish.
[02:50:29.640 --> 02:50:33.723]  I mean, she's German and Scottish, and it wouldn't be bad if she was Jewish.
[02:50:34.064 --> 02:50:41.190]  It's just at a certain point, it gets a little crazy when people believe that only Jews can have power.
[02:50:41.210 --> 02:50:43.792]  I mean, people say the name Jones is a Jewish name.
[02:50:43.812 --> 02:50:45.194]  I mean, I'm about as Jewish as...
[02:50:46.972 --> 02:50:47.892]  As a pork chop.
[02:50:48.793 --> 02:50:50.673]  But I mean, nothing against Jews, that's fine.
[02:50:51.554 --> 02:50:53.474]  But I'll certainly look into it.
[02:50:53.535 --> 02:50:54.895]  There is a big Jewish mafia.
[02:50:55.475 --> 02:50:59.437]  And it does use political correctness, and I'm certainly against it.
[02:50:59.457 --> 02:51:01.598]  Leanne, you're doing a cleanse this week, you were telling me next week.
[02:51:01.678 --> 02:51:05.599]  We're starting it coming up next Wednesday, so everyone be sure to get your products.
[02:51:05.679 --> 02:51:06.780]  We can do it together!
[02:51:06.960 --> 02:51:11.141]  That's right, you're going to be covering it on the Nightly News and Morning Videos on YouTube as you guys go through the cleanse with Livershield.
[02:51:13.422 --> 02:51:13.662]  I think.
[02:51:40.404 --> 02:51:41.204]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:51:41.224 --> 02:51:42.705]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:51:43.005 --> 02:51:44.305]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:51:44.666 --> 02:51:46.986]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:51:47.486 --> 02:51:49.347]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:51:49.767 --> 02:51:53.809]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:51:54.289 --> 02:51:57.990]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:51:58.230 --> 02:52:01.671]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:52:01.992 --> 02:52:02.412]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:52:02.432 --> 02:52:04.052]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:52:12.563 --> 02:52:21.870]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:52:22.170 --> 02:52:24.691]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:52:24.872 --> 02:52:28.214]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:52:28.434 --> 02:52:34.378]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:52:34.679 --> 02:52:39.422]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:52:39.702 --> 02:52:45.884]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:52:46.084 --> 02:52:53.485]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:52:53.745 --> 02:53:00.927]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[02:53:01.187 --> 02:53:04.608]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:53:04.788 --> 02:53:07.669]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:53:09.085 --> 02:53:10.507]  A sudden change in the wind.
[02:53:10.987 --> 02:53:12.128]  The day grows dark.
[02:53:12.669 --> 02:53:20.177]  As ominous clouds move in, and lightning begins to carve arcs in the sky, and you realize you are not prepared.
[02:53:21.879 --> 02:53:25.784]  Tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods can turn your world upside down.
[02:53:26.244 --> 02:53:30.389]  And if you are choosing to rely on the government to save you... And no one's coming to help him.
[02:53:30.629 --> 02:53:31.970]  You could be dead wrong.
[02:53:32.290 --> 02:53:37.331]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster is a visit to PowerPrepper.com.
[02:53:37.552 --> 02:53:40.093]  PowerPrepper.com has partnered with Numana.
[02:53:40.333 --> 02:53:49.236]  You'll find the most advanced water filtration devices and the best-tasting, non-GMO, gluten-free, long-term, storable food that you'll love to eat.
[02:53:49.436 --> 02:53:49.676]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:53:49.696 --> 02:53:49.776]  877-817-9829.
[02:53:49.796 --> 02:53:51.537]  And speak to one of our preparedness advisors today.
[02:53:57.859 --> 02:54:00.240]  Or visit us online at powerprepper.com.
[02:54:00.560 --> 02:54:02.141]  That's powerprepper.com.
[02:54:02.501 --> 02:54:04.582]  Remember, powerprepper.com.
[02:54:05.242 --> 02:54:07.863]  Storable food you'll love to eat.
[02:54:14.666 --> 02:54:18.107]  We had to bring her back, folks.
[02:54:19.208 --> 02:54:22.309]  All the world... All the world is waiting for you!
[02:54:26.890 --> 02:54:29.051]  You can turn her mic on, I think.
[02:54:29.331 --> 02:54:31.752]  Now you're on now.
[02:54:32.012 --> 02:54:33.652]  That is your new theme song.
[02:54:34.793 --> 02:54:35.873]  I am flattered.
[02:54:36.533 --> 02:54:41.715]  But we need to do a Wonder Woman song with you with guns and some of your friends shooting and blowing stuff up.
[02:54:41.895 --> 02:54:42.255]  I'm ready.
[02:54:43.035 --> 02:54:44.536]  Feminists, eat your heart out.
[02:54:45.376 --> 02:54:46.516]  Fire a rocket launcher.
[02:54:47.717 --> 02:54:48.377]  Blow a truck up.
[02:54:49.249 --> 02:54:51.511]  All their, like, pantsuits will just fly off?
[02:54:51.871 --> 02:54:58.657]  No, I brought you back in because I realized that I'm going to plug this hour and your friend who's a sports model, she's also in some pretty big movies.
[02:54:59.178 --> 02:55:00.579]  She starred in some pretty big movies.
[02:55:01.300 --> 02:55:02.481]  Flattered to have her here.
[02:55:02.521 --> 02:55:10.308]  I remember meeting her years ago, you guys over at the White Horse, watching some hillbilly music, but moreover with Mike Judge, but not name-dropping as I am.
[02:55:10.328 --> 02:55:11.869]  No, it's just true.
[02:55:12.209 --> 02:55:13.631]  The point is, is that
[02:55:15.074 --> 02:55:24.544]  She did it, had dramatic results, now you're both going to do it together and just document what you eat, what you do, how much weight you lose, what happens, without getting too much into it.
[02:55:24.744 --> 02:55:28.308]  But Liver Shield is back in stock, folks, and it's good to do this together.
[02:55:28.688 --> 02:55:34.014]  Next week would be a great time, if you haven't ordered it, go ahead, or the next week after that, to try the Liver Cleanse.
[02:55:34.675 --> 02:55:36.396]  And so tell us about what you're going to be doing, Leanne.
[02:55:37.110 --> 02:55:40.932]  Well, uh, we're going to start this on Wednesday of next week.
[02:55:40.972 --> 02:55:44.713]  We'll be uploading a lot of videos, uh, just kind of doing like a daily diary.
[02:55:44.793 --> 02:55:51.336]  So people who are also going along with this cleanse with us, we can sort of be each other's support system.
[02:55:51.936 --> 02:55:57.418]  Um, I'm sure we'll take some before and after photos and document the disappearing Buddha belly.
[02:55:57.438 --> 02:56:00.039]  You really don't have much of a Buddha belly.
[02:56:00.159 --> 02:56:01.180]  I got a Buddha belly.
[02:56:01.260 --> 02:56:01.880]  I really do.
[02:56:02.680 --> 02:56:05.721]  You know, I just thank you mom for the good genes.
[02:56:05.862 --> 02:56:06.482]  I carry it well.
[02:56:07.475 --> 02:56:10.097]  Leanne, a Buddha belly is a giant fat belly.
[02:56:10.557 --> 02:56:11.938]  You don't have a Buddha belly.
[02:56:12.399 --> 02:56:14.200]  It's a baby Buddha belly.
[02:56:14.220 --> 02:56:16.302]  A sumo wrestler has a Buddha belly.
[02:56:16.482 --> 02:56:17.523]  It's a little Buddha belly.
[02:56:17.583 --> 02:56:19.364]  I had a small Buddha belly three years ago.
[02:56:19.404 --> 02:56:21.005]  Hey, my Buddha belly is almost gone.
[02:56:21.426 --> 02:56:22.627]  I saw the before and afters.
[02:56:22.647 --> 02:56:23.908]  We took some photos just the other day.
[02:56:23.928 --> 02:56:25.108]  We need to get those out soon.
[02:56:25.389 --> 02:56:26.429]  I'm going to show those today.
[02:56:26.449 --> 02:56:27.310]  I've lost even more weight.
[02:56:27.410 --> 02:56:30.593]  No, that was truly impressive because I've seen the progression.
[02:56:31.453 --> 02:56:34.696]  And I've been actually eating just as much as ever and everything and less exercise.
[02:56:34.756 --> 02:56:35.476]  It's all the
[02:56:36.738 --> 02:56:38.800]  X2, Super Mel Vitality, the rest of it.
[02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:41.122]  Leigh-Anne, what does Super Female Vitality do for you?
[02:56:42.283 --> 02:56:44.765]  It really boosts my confidence.
[02:56:44.885 --> 02:56:46.346]  I'll go ahead and say that.
[02:56:47.127 --> 02:56:48.908]  Makes a little extra hair flip.
[02:56:49.108 --> 02:56:56.935]  Well, yeah, you were telling me a year ago you couldn't really do a plug for it because it's a lot of children programming, but the point is it's really... It was extreme.
[02:56:57.556 --> 02:57:03.741]  Infowarslife.com, Super Mel Vitality is back in... Buckley ran in there in the break and goes, don't tell people it's back in!
[02:57:03.781 --> 02:57:04.902]  The truck gets here Monday!
[02:57:06.189 --> 02:57:08.450]  Point is, you can order it now for all intents and purposes.
[02:57:08.490 --> 02:57:09.731]  The truck's on the way from Utah.
[02:57:10.311 --> 02:57:11.872]  It's probably like in Oklahoma by now.
[02:57:11.892 --> 02:57:12.713]  Maybe we'll get her tomorrow.
[02:57:12.993 --> 02:57:15.574]  You can pre-order it, and it'll get out to your ship out next week.
[02:57:15.975 --> 02:57:17.255]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:57:17.776 --> 02:57:22.658]  Leanne McAdoo, we salute you, we thank you, we appreciate you, and we will be seeing you on the Mountain Dew tonight.
[02:57:22.859 --> 02:57:24.199]  Let's go out with our theme song.
[02:57:24.239 --> 02:57:26.100]  Now, actually, I need to go to phone calls.
[02:57:26.561 --> 02:57:28.402]  I went from really being angry and upset
[02:57:29.352 --> 02:57:31.933]  In the first hour or so now, calming down a little bit.
[02:57:31.953 --> 02:57:41.375]  So we're going to take a break and come back with Blaine, then we're going to go to William Morgan, and then we're going to go to Timothy, and then Daisy and Patricia.
[02:57:41.755 --> 02:57:55.279]  If I can't get to Daisy and Patricia in the next five minutes when we come back, the great statesman, David Knight, and I say that, he's kind of a statesman type guy, he will be hosting the transmission in the fourth hour.
[02:57:55.339 --> 02:57:58.100]  But I will do five minutes coming back.
[02:57:58.220 --> 02:57:58.480]  And look,
[02:57:59.687 --> 02:58:07.608]  I want everybody to know, worldwide folks are waking up, worldwide people are angry, worldwide folks are waking up to the scientific engineering of society.
[02:58:08.229 --> 02:58:09.949]  So there's a lot of positive stuff happening.
[02:58:10.749 --> 02:58:20.191]  At the same time, the left is the mode of totalitarian bullying right now, and in college campuses every day we see articles where they say, if you're Tea Party, I will kill you.
[02:58:21.131 --> 02:58:22.791]  Or, it's time to lock up the gun owners.
[02:58:22.871 --> 02:58:26.332]  I mean, we need to really have the real left in this country intervene
[02:58:28.075 --> 02:58:30.339]  With the dangerous fascism coming out of your party.
[02:58:30.740 --> 02:58:34.746]  I mean, when Bush was in there power-grabbing, we opposed him, and I'm more of a libertarian-type conservative.
[02:58:35.107 --> 02:58:36.549]  You could use that term in the paradigm.
[02:58:36.569 --> 02:58:38.532]  I mean, it's really bigger than that, but I mean...
[02:58:39.802 --> 02:58:40.042]  Really?
[02:58:40.102 --> 02:58:43.563]  I mean, you want them arresting, you know, Ron Paul and Rand Paul next?
[02:58:43.643 --> 02:58:45.364]  I mean, Dinesh D'Souza wasn't enough?
[02:58:45.684 --> 02:58:47.725]  You really want me arrested and put in a FEMA camp?
[02:58:47.965 --> 02:58:49.546]  You feel safe in a country like that?
[02:58:49.766 --> 02:58:51.986]  You really want the NDAA and NSA spying?
[02:58:52.587 --> 02:58:53.507]  Back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:53.527 --> 02:58:53.987]  Stay with us.
[02:59:00.057 --> 02:59:09.065]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:59:09.145 --> 02:59:17.392]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:17.552 --> 02:59:22.257]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:22.437 --> 02:59:26.100]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee
[02:59:27.401 --> 02:59:28.102]  We're good to go.
[02:59:51.283 --> 02:59:52.965]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:12.771 --> 03:00:18.798]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:19.398 --> 03:00:22.442]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:22.702 --> 03:00:25.425]  That's not talk, that's not words, that's not rhetoric.
[03:00:25.485 --> 03:00:26.746]  It is an info war.
[03:00:27.627 --> 03:00:31.031]  And I'm the bull in a china cabinet going ape inside their operation.
[03:00:31.592 --> 03:00:32.172]  Please join me.
[03:00:32.893 --> 03:00:34.655]  Hey Alex, it's good to be on the air.
[03:00:35.075 --> 03:00:37.037]  Can you hear me alright?
[03:00:37.057 --> 03:00:37.357]  Yes sir, I can.
[03:00:37.377 --> 03:00:38.378]  Thanks for holding.
[03:00:38.538 --> 03:00:39.078]  Good deal.
[03:00:39.098 --> 03:00:40.540]  Yeah, no problem.
[03:00:40.580 --> 03:00:42.501]  Real quick, I got two points.
[03:00:42.561 --> 03:00:49.207]  One point I want to make real quick is that I want to plug beyond tangy tangerine.
[03:00:49.227 --> 03:00:52.630]  I just want to remind people how
[03:01:00.965 --> 03:01:03.947]  Essential, that is, for your overall well-being.
[03:01:04.007 --> 03:01:06.849]  I read the book, Dead Doctors Don't Lie, by Dr. Joe Wallach.
[03:01:07.029 --> 03:01:07.689]  Absolutely.
[03:01:07.790 --> 03:01:12.713]  Infowarshealth.com is where folks can get Beyond Tangy Tangerines, and that helps support the broadcast.
[03:01:12.773 --> 03:01:14.374]  A true game-changer.
[03:01:14.414 --> 03:01:19.037]  In fact, I'm getting ready to do a whole push for the whole Longevity line, because it's so good.
[03:01:20.558 --> 03:01:20.998]  Absolutely.
[03:01:21.058 --> 03:01:25.801]  I would go on and say that was the number one most important product that people should take every day.
[03:01:26.322 --> 03:01:29.624]  But moving on to my second point, Alex, I got a question about carbon taxes.
[03:01:31.329 --> 03:01:47.125]  Um, it's my understand, actually I want to ask just exactly how and who benefits from the carbon tax, because these regulations that are going to be slapped on these big factories and corporations, to my understanding, it's going to cut down production and just increase prices for the consumer.
[03:01:47.145 --> 03:01:49.528]  So how do they benefit from a carbon tax?
[03:01:49.988 --> 03:01:53.192]  To produce credit, they have to buy a carbon credit from one of
[03:01:54.363 --> 03:02:03.247]  Ten exchanges I know of, two in the U.S., one in England, a couple in Europe, some in China, Japan, Australia, and it's all owned by former government leaders.
[03:02:03.307 --> 03:02:06.248]  The Rothschilds own the big European exchange and U.K.
[03:02:06.268 --> 03:02:06.748]  exchange.
[03:02:07.408 --> 03:02:11.910]  Al Gore owns one of them with Lord Blood.
[03:02:12.230 --> 03:02:15.211]  I'm not joking, it's actually Gore and Blood is the name of the company.
[03:02:16.012 --> 03:02:21.634]  The Chicago Mercantile Carbon Exchange is owned by Obama and some other Democrats.
[03:02:22.654 --> 03:02:23.615]  You can't make this up.
[03:02:24.735 --> 03:02:26.977]  They already have them in Australia, England, and other areas.
[03:02:27.578 --> 03:02:31.121]  And then you don't even... It's just a fee on your energy bill or on your gas.
[03:02:31.882 --> 03:02:35.666]  And then that fee is paid directly to Al Gore.
[03:02:38.568 --> 03:02:38.889]  Okay.
[03:02:41.109 --> 03:02:43.010]  I mean, that pretty much answers my question, Alex.
[03:02:43.050 --> 03:02:47.851]  No, I mean, it's politicians having you pay taxes to a consortium that then pays them.
[03:02:47.931 --> 03:02:57.154]  It is the most gang-raping you can have, other than mega-banks demanding bail-ins, where they're now going to take money and are doing it directly out of European bank accounts.
[03:02:58.175 --> 03:02:59.595]  It's direct tax to the bankers.
[03:02:59.895 --> 03:03:00.556]  That's world government.
[03:03:00.896 --> 03:03:01.656]  Just direct.
[03:03:02.483 --> 03:03:04.624]  Just like secret treaties rule us, you name it.
[03:03:04.684 --> 03:03:07.686]  If you don't like it, you're a racist, and they'll say you're with Red Skull.
[03:03:07.826 --> 03:03:08.806]  You know, I mean, that's what they do.
[03:03:08.826 --> 03:03:10.427]  You're like, hey, I don't want to be under secret treaties.
[03:03:10.667 --> 03:03:10.887]  Really?
[03:03:10.907 --> 03:03:14.269]  Well, say you're a racist and love Red Skull and put Nazi flags behind you.
[03:03:14.289 --> 03:03:15.449]  It's like, oh, really?
[03:03:15.469 --> 03:03:16.350]  Thank you very much, Marvel.
[03:03:16.710 --> 03:03:17.510]  You're total scum.
[03:03:17.550 --> 03:03:19.391]  You're total criminal trash.
[03:03:20.972 --> 03:03:22.453]  Preying on your moron readers.
[03:03:22.513 --> 03:03:23.013]  God bless you.
[03:03:23.033 --> 03:03:23.754]  Appreciate your call.
[03:03:24.554 --> 03:03:26.735]  William Morgan in FEMA Region 4.
[03:03:27.255 --> 03:03:28.116]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:03:28.136 --> 03:03:29.857]  Can you hear me all right?
[03:03:29.897 --> 03:03:30.337]  Yes, I can.
[03:03:31.840 --> 03:03:32.321]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:32.422 --> 03:03:39.001]  I'm a longtime listener, first-time caller, but I am a Freemason, and I know we moved past it.
[03:03:39.651 --> 03:03:49.814]  But I just wanted to say that there is a large contingency, if you want to call it that, inside the Masonic Lodge system that is very pro-InfoWars, just like me.
[03:03:49.874 --> 03:03:54.995]  They're very libertarian, very anti-New World Order, all of it.
[03:03:55.176 --> 03:03:58.677]  Well, yeah, that's originally what it was, at least in the European and U.S.
[03:03:58.717 --> 03:04:03.198]  branch, as everybody, historically, was overall pretty good for the Enlightenment.
[03:04:03.418 --> 03:04:06.719]  But now, wouldn't you agree, though, they've had a lot of globalist people in there taking it over?
[03:04:08.565 --> 03:04:10.268]  Um, yes, yes and no.
[03:04:10.448 --> 03:04:11.510]  Obviously, I've encountered it.
[03:04:11.530 --> 03:04:13.973]  I'm certainly not a porch mason, as you call it.
[03:04:14.013 --> 03:04:18.079]  I'm a member of the Allied Masonic Degrees and other high-level, invitational-only bodies.
[03:04:19.241 --> 03:04:24.208]  But I do encounter a large amount of anti-New World Order
[03:04:24.781 --> 03:04:33.006]  Pro-sovereignty, pro-traditional Americana, uh, in the messiah's... Well, I mean, the problem with criticizing Masons is, you're criticizing Americana.
[03:04:33.486 --> 03:04:35.787]  Masons were the main force founding America.
[03:04:36.447 --> 03:04:39.449]  And that is a fact, and that's why the globalists have tried to take it over.
[03:04:39.469 --> 03:04:45.773]  And that's why I would say, tell people, you know, they can investigate it for themselves, and it's just like good people becoming cops.
[03:04:46.690 --> 03:04:49.912]  If people become Masons, you know, then they can make it be a force of good.
[03:04:49.932 --> 03:04:51.233]  And I'm not saying go become Masons.
[03:04:51.293 --> 03:04:51.973]  I don't need to.
[03:04:52.494 --> 03:04:57.337]  I just am not going to sit here and just say, it's a Masonic conspiracy and they run the whole thing.
[03:04:57.777 --> 03:04:58.557]  It's bigger than that.
[03:04:58.617 --> 03:04:59.778]  I'm sorry I'm out of time, William.
[03:04:59.818 --> 03:05:00.338]  Call me back.
[03:05:00.699 --> 03:05:01.579]  You can speak more on it.
[03:05:01.939 --> 03:05:05.502]  Other callers, David Knight's coming up, and I'll be back this Sunday.
[03:05:05.622 --> 03:05:06.782]  Lord willing, pray for us.
[03:05:06.802 --> 03:05:08.704]  4 to 6 p.m.
[03:05:08.724 --> 03:05:09.024]  Central.
[03:05:10.083 --> 03:05:14.606]  Villains in new Captain America comic are opponents of illegal immigration.
[03:05:14.846 --> 03:05:18.328]  Article up by Steve Watson at Infowars.com.
[03:05:18.488 --> 03:05:23.051]  Captain America started out by taking on Nazis and defending freedom.
[03:05:23.331 --> 03:05:31.957]  Now, however, Marvel has him siding with Democrats in Washington and beating up on conservatives who quote the US Constitution.
[03:05:32.437 --> 03:05:33.938]  US boots on the ground in
[03:05:34.178 --> 03:05:34.719]  We're good to go.
[03:05:50.237 --> 03:05:54.678]  Surveillance and reconnaissance operations in the region, according to the BBC.
[03:05:54.819 --> 03:06:06.962]  The effort will expand the mission of AFRICOM, the Pentagon's African command, and would be part of a broader regional effort to stop the spread of Boko Haram and other violent extremist organizations in West Africa.
[03:06:07.042 --> 03:06:09.343]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[03:06:09.723 --> 03:06:12.944]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:06:13.224 --> 03:06:18.146]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[03:06:18.186 --> 03:06:18.546]  I don't know.
[03:06:39.462 --> 03:06:40.483]  The brain force is here.
[03:06:40.663 --> 03:06:42.764]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:06:42.864 --> 03:06:47.606]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of brain force.
[03:06:47.867 --> 03:06:49.507]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[03:06:49.567 --> 03:06:51.068]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:06:51.148 --> 03:06:54.350]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:06:54.630 --> 03:06:56.451]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:06:56.611 --> 03:06:57.512]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[03:06:57.532 --> 03:06:58.532]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:06:58.712 --> 03:07:00.613]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[03:07:00.733 --> 03:07:06.316]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:07:12.479 --> 03:07:21.860]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[03:07:22.220 --> 03:07:24.781]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[03:07:24.921 --> 03:07:28.261]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[03:07:28.481 --> 03:07:34.482]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[03:07:34.803 --> 03:07:37.323]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[03:07:37.503 --> 03:07:37.703]  I'm good.
[03:07:57.441 --> 03:08:02.784]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:02.884 --> 03:08:04.805]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:29.229 --> 03:08:31.430]  Welcome to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[03:08:31.470 --> 03:08:32.130]  I'm David Knight.
[03:08:32.590 --> 03:08:33.731]  This is the news wrap-up.
[03:08:33.751 --> 03:08:35.491]  We're also going to wrap up with our callers.
[03:08:35.511 --> 03:08:38.333]  We're going to go to Patricia, Timothy, and Daisy, who are on hold.
[03:08:38.353 --> 03:08:42.734]  We're not going to take any more calls after that because we're going to talk about what's been happening in the news.
[03:08:42.794 --> 03:08:48.736]  As I mentioned with Alex Jones, there's been a major release about the drone program.
[03:08:49.277 --> 03:08:51.317]  Actually, the assassination program, as they point out.
[03:08:51.638 --> 03:08:52.778]  Drones are simply a tool.
[03:08:53.178 --> 03:08:54.779]  Assassination is the policy.
[03:08:55.499 --> 03:09:02.182]  And just yesterday we had Paul Craig Roberts saying that Putin needs to be very careful the CIA may assassinate him.
[03:09:02.222 --> 03:09:02.623]  Of course!
[03:09:03.103 --> 03:09:08.486]  That is an issue that is always in the forefront when you're dealing with the American government anymore.
[03:09:08.506 --> 03:09:12.928]  It used to be that we were ashamed of that even when we were doing it back in the 1970s.
[03:09:13.428 --> 03:09:18.891]  Now they openly do it and we're going to look at this drone leak of this classified document
[03:09:19.830 --> 03:09:22.153]  Talk about what it shows us, what it doesn't show us.
[03:09:22.173 --> 03:09:28.219]  We're also going to talk about the double standard in the religion of the national security state.
[03:09:28.900 --> 03:09:39.752]  We've seen NSA whistleblowers like Thomas Drake that I talked to a couple of months ago talking at the time about the double standard between the way they were coming after him and the way they're not coming after Hillary Clinton.
[03:09:39.772 --> 03:09:41.113]  And of course we have Obama
[03:09:41.954 --> 03:09:44.777]  Essentially pouring cold water on the FBI's investigation.
[03:09:44.798 --> 03:09:52.046]  So we're going to talk about what's happened to some of the recent whistleblowers and what looks like is not going to happen with Hillary Clinton.
[03:09:52.527 --> 03:09:59.615]  Also we have Ron Paul talking about the greatest resistance to the Federal Reserve audit is a desire to keep international activities secret.
[03:09:59.655 --> 03:10:00.556]  What's behind that?
[03:10:01.337 --> 03:10:08.320]  The push to do ammo control, because you know folks, if you don't have ammunition, your guns are simply clubs.
[03:10:08.961 --> 03:10:16.024]  They don't need to go door-to-door and fight you to take your guns, because you won't have any bullets if you can't continuously replace them.
[03:10:16.044 --> 03:10:21.927]  So we're going to talk about how that's been a part of the Obama administration from the very beginning of the administration.
[03:10:21.947 --> 03:10:25.569]  And finally, I want to talk about the top French meteorologist.
[03:10:26.129 --> 03:10:28.450]  Who was recently told not to report to work.
[03:10:28.911 --> 03:10:33.594]  Take a forced holiday because he debunked climate hysteria.
[03:10:34.074 --> 03:10:35.355]  Can't have that happen, can we?
[03:10:35.415 --> 03:10:35.535]  No.
[03:10:36.015 --> 03:10:39.857]  So we're going to go to some of those subjects and we're going to go to our callers in just a moment.
[03:10:39.898 --> 03:10:44.781]  Before I do, I want to let you know that we have extended the sale on InfoWars Select Storable Food.

[03:11:45.321 --> 03:11:48.801]  That's Infowarslife.com for Supermail Vitality.
[03:11:49.242 --> 03:11:50.502]  Let's go to your calls right now.
[03:11:50.562 --> 03:11:51.062]  Let's go to
[03:11:52.082 --> 03:11:53.042]  Patricia in Arizona.
[03:11:53.402 --> 03:11:54.202]  You've been holding for a while.
[03:11:54.222 --> 03:11:54.823]  Go ahead, Patricia.
[03:11:56.283 --> 03:11:56.903]  Hi, David.
[03:11:58.163 --> 03:12:14.066]  I live in Yuma, Arizona, and considering you're going to talk about drones today, I live right over the mountains from a government testing ground, and someone told me that... I asked them why are there so many drones in the sky every night.
[03:12:14.126 --> 03:12:17.027]  They said that this is the testing area for them.
[03:12:17.992 --> 03:12:20.018]  I mean, it's not unusual for me.
[03:12:20.279 --> 03:12:24.532]  One night I looked just on one side of my house and counted 35 drums.
[03:12:27.506 --> 03:12:38.776]  Well, you know, I think we're going to see a lot more drones everywhere, not just in test areas, because we have the Bureau of Land Management, as well as the EPA, using drones to constantly surveil us.
[03:12:38.816 --> 03:12:44.942]  They're mapping out what they see on the ground, but they're also looking to see if they can find you violating a regulation of some sort.
[03:12:45.362 --> 03:12:50.787]  And so it's going to be a constant surveillance, a constant taxation by the people who write the laws.
[03:12:51.167 --> 03:12:54.208]  They're then going to use these drones to police those laws.
[03:12:54.248 --> 03:12:58.550]  They'll drag you into their regulatory courts where you have no presumption of innocence.
[03:12:58.910 --> 03:13:05.072]  They're going to pretend that you're being tried under civil law, just like we're talking about civil asset forfeiture under the drug law.
[03:13:05.452 --> 03:13:10.294]  That's what they will do, just like they came after that poor fellow in Montana who has only eight acres.
[03:13:10.614 --> 03:13:11.254]  He's a welder.
[03:13:11.314 --> 03:13:16.396]  He put in a pond, a stock pond, as well as a swimming hole for his kids.
[03:13:16.696 --> 03:13:18.237]  The water doesn't cross his boundaries.
[03:13:19.517 --> 03:13:22.019]  Went through all the paperwork for the state and local levels.
[03:13:22.219 --> 03:13:23.140]  No problems whatsoever.
[03:13:23.160 --> 03:13:26.602]  But the EPA thinks that they own all the water in the world now.
[03:13:27.063 --> 03:13:31.886]  And so they came in and put $37,500 a day fines against him.
[03:13:31.946 --> 03:13:33.828]  His tab is now over $16 million.
[03:13:33.868 --> 03:13:36.990]  So that's what they're going to use these drones for in the long run.
[03:13:37.030 --> 03:13:45.417]  But yeah, it is very concerning to see how they are ramping up the use of this high-tech surveillance equipment besides testing it.
[03:13:45.457 --> 03:13:47.078]  I guess they're testing it in your area.
[03:13:49.076 --> 03:14:04.748]  Well, I called because yesterday Alex was talking about how they're going to, you know, this new cities thing with the UN and all that, and how they're going to be profiling people.
[03:14:05.789 --> 03:14:13.575]  And I just wanted... This is an area, a relatively older, an older community.
[03:14:14.660 --> 03:14:19.101]  A lot of people come down to Arizona for the winter, you know, snowbirds, we call them.
[03:14:19.421 --> 03:14:19.641]  Yeah.
[03:14:20.302 --> 03:14:25.003]  And a lot of these people own guns, and they are patriots.
[03:14:26.123 --> 03:14:36.126]  But we had the gas company coming here, saying they were seeing where the pipes were, and walking through.
[03:14:36.146 --> 03:14:39.567]  And then I went and looked at the truck, and the truck had a consulting firm.
[03:14:40.444 --> 03:14:40.804]  I don't know.
[03:15:05.396 --> 03:15:11.003]  And then the gas company, a few days later, I see this guy with a computer and he's standing in front of each yard.
[03:15:11.584 --> 03:15:12.765]  And I said, what are you guys doing?
[03:15:12.845 --> 03:15:16.270]  And he said, oh, we're finding out where the meters are.
[03:15:17.271 --> 03:15:23.679]  But I looked on the guy's computer and they were not only finding out where the meters were, but they were mapping out the entire yard.
[03:15:24.161 --> 03:15:26.002]  Yeah, that's the thing that's concerning, isn't it?
[03:15:26.082 --> 03:15:30.645]  How they will not be open and transparent with anything that they're doing.
[03:15:31.026 --> 03:15:32.386]  We see this over and over again.
[03:15:32.426 --> 03:15:38.190]  That's the thing that really sticks in my craw, the fact that they will not tell you what they're doing.
[03:15:38.570 --> 03:15:39.771]  Why are they ashamed of this?
[03:15:39.931 --> 03:15:41.853]  Everything that they do is secret.
[03:15:42.333 --> 03:15:44.875]  And of course, Patricia, when you're talking about this,
[03:15:45.655 --> 03:15:57.517]  We need to understand that with geospatial intelligence, with the kinds of things that we saw Jade Helm practicing on, they made it very clear what they were doing was trying to map out where people are.
[03:15:57.758 --> 03:16:05.779]  Part of geospatial intelligence is looking at your political, your religious beliefs, your social activity, looking at your... creating activity-based intelligence.
[03:16:05.819 --> 03:16:06.439]  Where do you go?
[03:16:06.519 --> 03:16:07.239]  Who do you see?
[03:16:07.920 --> 03:16:09.160]  Who are the people that you know?
[03:16:10.120 --> 03:16:14.744]  And then putting all of this into a database and choosing targets by algorithm.
[03:16:15.505 --> 03:16:17.547]  All of this converges together.
[03:16:17.587 --> 03:16:25.434]  When you're talking about the strong city network, my understanding of it, at least at this point, this is something that's risen originally out of Europe.
[03:16:25.974 --> 03:16:32.039]  And the think tank that is going to be running this, as the Department of Justice press release said, there's going to be a think tank in Europe that's running it.
[03:16:32.079 --> 03:16:41.146]  If you go back and you look at what this think tank has been preoccupied with in Europe, they're concerned about anti-migrant, anti-Islam comments.
[03:16:41.226 --> 03:16:44.208]  When they talk about radical extremists, they're not talking about
[03:16:45.049 --> 03:16:45.630]  Jihadis.
[03:16:46.030 --> 03:16:50.474]  They're talking about people who don't like the massive open borders.
[03:16:50.734 --> 03:16:51.935]  That's what they're targeting at.
[03:16:52.375 --> 03:16:56.719]  And so you look at these various efforts just like we had yesterday.
[03:16:56.759 --> 03:17:00.722]  We had a new initiative coming from the Department of Justice saying they're going to look at domestic terrorists.
[03:17:01.443 --> 03:17:09.770]  Every couple of days we see another move by the Obama administration to target people that are in political opposition to them.
[03:17:10.330 --> 03:17:20.520]  And when they put all these people together, when they start mapping your political beliefs, your religious beliefs, and your activity, all this, and put it into a database, they want to see who pops up.
[03:17:21.401 --> 03:17:32.612]  And the opportunity for false positives, for them to target people that are no threat to them, other than the fact that we oppose them politically, that is what's really, really dangerous, and that's not what they even talk about.
[03:17:33.092 --> 03:17:33.473]  That's bad enough.
[03:17:54.574 --> 03:17:57.956]  That we have a policy of assassination that is run like that.
[03:17:58.476 --> 03:17:59.136]  That's bad enough.
[03:17:59.596 --> 03:18:20.246]  But when we have a situation where we've got a computer algorithm that is going to be targeting people, when we have situations where they're talking about creating and are actually working on swarming drones, autonomous killing machines, and then we have computers that create enemies by algorithm, I mean, this is absolutely insane, but this is where we're headed if we don't stop this, Patricia.
[03:18:23.419 --> 03:18:24.880]  What can we do?
[03:18:25.280 --> 03:18:30.302]  I feel like they are seriously profiling some people out here.
[03:18:30.482 --> 03:18:32.463]  Oh, they are seriously profiling everybody.
[03:18:32.963 --> 03:18:34.564]  This is total information awareness.
[03:18:34.604 --> 03:18:39.346]  This has been the modus operandi of the government since their 9-11 attacks.
[03:18:39.426 --> 03:18:41.687]  This is what the Patriot Act is all fundamentally about.
[03:18:42.267 --> 03:18:44.948]  And they've been working on all this for a very long time.
[03:18:45.008 --> 03:18:46.348]  That is where this is all headed.
[03:18:46.629 --> 03:18:47.309]  How do we stop it?
[03:18:47.909 --> 03:18:50.090]  I don't think we can stop it in Washington.
[03:18:50.430 --> 03:18:50.890]  I don't think.
[03:18:50.950 --> 03:18:52.430]  These bureaucracies are out of control.
[03:18:52.530 --> 03:19:01.552]  I think what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to start electing people at the local level, at the state level, who are going to say, you are going to respect our privacy.
[03:19:01.632 --> 03:19:11.114]  You are not going and monitoring this, making sure that they're not going to use utility companies or contractors to collect information and to profile us and to put us into a database.
[03:19:11.154 --> 03:19:13.234]  We have to stop it at the data collection point.
[03:19:13.274 --> 03:19:16.275]  And we have to do that, Patricia, I think at the local level.
[03:19:16.975 --> 03:19:22.217]  And I think when we look at the presidential races, yes, it's important to understand where their long-term strategies are.
[03:19:22.257 --> 03:19:24.498]  It's important to see where they're going and what they're doing.
[03:19:24.538 --> 03:19:32.442]  But if we're going to stop anything, if we're going to be anything other than casual observers, we're going to have to get active at the local level.
[03:19:32.962 --> 03:19:41.387]  And everything that they do is designed to get you involved in a useless exercise about the presidential race.
[03:19:41.447 --> 03:19:49.212]  And if I could tell people anything, it would be, yes, follow the presidential race, understand where these people are going, but understand that's not going to solve your problem.
[03:19:49.252 --> 03:19:51.173]  That's not going to stop this bureaucracy.
[03:19:51.193 --> 03:19:53.275]  The bureaucracy has a life of its own.
[03:19:53.555 --> 03:19:57.537]  It's going to run through this unless we put prohibitions at the local level.
[03:19:57.757 --> 03:20:00.279]  We're going to have people at the sheriff's level who are
[03:20:00.299 --> 03:20:07.641]  We're going to say to Homeland Security, you're not going to confiscate the guns, you're not going to violate people's property, you're not going to surveil people and collect information on them.
[03:20:08.061 --> 03:20:08.541]  Stay with us.
[03:20:08.581 --> 03:20:09.261]  Thank you Patricia.

[03:23:49.476 --> 03:23:52.799]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:23:52.819 --> 03:23:54.641]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:23:54.881 --> 03:23:57.944]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:23:58.004 --> 03:24:00.025]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:00.045 --> 03:24:02.906]  I'm David Knight, your host in this fourth hour news wrap-up.
[03:24:24.500 --> 03:24:33.246]  As we were talking to the last caller, talking about what is coming down the pike, of course we can look historically at what's been done with drones.
[03:24:33.306 --> 03:24:36.889]  And there's been a new leak of documents that's been published by The Intercept.
[03:24:37.029 --> 03:24:40.672]  That's Glenn Greenwald's publication.
[03:24:40.712 --> 03:24:42.653]  They're the ones who published the Snowden documents.
[03:24:43.233 --> 03:24:47.897]  We now have some classified documents that actually back up what we've heard for quite some time.
[03:24:48.537 --> 03:24:58.020]  That most of the people who are being targeted for these assassinations are not, they're getting a very small hit rate on people that they would actually target.
[03:24:58.060 --> 03:25:00.521]  And of course there's questions about even the people that they're targeting.
[03:25:00.561 --> 03:25:05.742]  But 90% of the people that are being killed are what they used to call collateral damage.
[03:25:05.842 --> 03:25:08.463]  Now they're saying, well, they're guilty by association.
[03:25:08.483 --> 03:25:11.404]  They're not even using the term collateral damage anymore.
[03:25:12.423 --> 03:25:21.428]  When Alex Jones interviewed Annie Jacobson about her book, The Pentagon's Brain, I've been reading that book and what it really tells you is the Pentagon's mindset.
[03:25:22.508 --> 03:25:32.334]  Now, they're talking about the Pentagon's brain trust, essentially DARPA, the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects, the long history going back to right after World War II.
[03:25:33.527 --> 03:25:36.328]  When they were created, what they were doing through the Cold War, through the Vietnam War.
[03:25:36.968 --> 03:25:40.089]  As she mentioned before, we've had drones since the Vietnam War.
[03:25:40.429 --> 03:25:47.611]  And of course we know from declassified documents that they were plotting a 9-11 style attack called Operation Northwoods.
[03:25:48.371 --> 03:25:59.774]  They were going to fly civilian airliners, remote-controlled, remote-controlled folks, into buildings and then blame the terror attack on Cuba so they could invade Cuba.
[03:25:59.814 --> 03:26:02.175]  So there's nothing fundamentally new about this.
[03:26:02.935 --> 03:26:10.498]  But what is going to be new and what is not talked about in these documents, because these documents are historical, is what we are on the cusp of.
[03:26:11.397 --> 03:26:23.166]  And as an illustration, just consider the fact that Tesla cars yesterday, if you're an owner, you woke up and your new car had all kinds of capability that was automatically downloaded to it overnight.
[03:26:23.326 --> 03:26:33.053]  If you have a Tesla Model S or Model X electric car, your car suddenly had the capability to drive itself with a new software update when you woke up.
[03:26:33.253 --> 03:26:33.913]  Now, why was that?
[03:26:34.614 --> 03:26:39.898]  Well, it was because they had already pre-positioned and tested all of the components that they needed.
[03:26:40.638 --> 03:26:45.360]  That's what we have to be concerned about with our government, with the military-industrial complex that we see.
[03:26:45.660 --> 03:26:50.762]  They're pre-positioning and pre-testing all of these components of control.
[03:26:51.342 --> 03:26:52.403]  Population control.
[03:26:52.763 --> 03:26:58.165]  Whether it's psychological mind control, whether it's controlling cars so they can control your movements.
[03:26:59.165 --> 03:27:08.639]  As they also spy on your movements and map that into a database so they can then put it into an automated targeting system to identify you perhaps as a threat.
[03:27:09.260 --> 03:27:15.488]  Releasing their autonomous killing machines that we know that they're rapidly entering an arms race on with that.
[03:27:16.309 --> 03:27:17.990]  This is the danger that we're looking at.
[03:27:18.050 --> 03:27:20.430]  Now, when you look at a car like a Tesla car, what have they done?
[03:27:20.470 --> 03:27:29.353]  They'd already put in forward-looking radar, forward-looking cameras, long-range ultrasonic sensors, braking and steering controls, etc., etc.
[03:27:29.754 --> 03:27:34.215]  So then all they had to do was to update the software so that it all played together.
[03:27:34.575 --> 03:27:38.997]  And of course, they say in the long run, you're not going to have to keep your cars on the wheels.
[03:27:39.037 --> 03:27:40.057]  We've heard this many times.
[03:27:40.097 --> 03:27:41.358]  There won't be any steering wheels.
[03:27:41.398 --> 03:27:43.158]  There won't be any braking pedals.
[03:27:43.258 --> 03:27:45.219]  They will be in complete control.
[03:27:46.500 --> 03:27:49.201]  And the government, essentially, is going to be in complete control.
[03:27:49.221 --> 03:27:57.984]  They're going to share all the information about where you're going, what you're doing, with the government, so they can tax you, they can shut your car down, they can do whatever they wish.
[03:27:58.764 --> 03:28:03.986]  It is a means of control, of transportation control, which is really population control.
[03:28:04.026 --> 03:28:08.348]  That's why when we talk about gun control, we say, that is really controlling people.
[03:28:09.148 --> 03:28:10.549]  Let me give you another example of this.
[03:28:10.589 --> 03:28:12.209]  We've talked about this as well many times.
[03:28:12.429 --> 03:28:12.669]  Uber.
[03:28:13.110 --> 03:28:18.272]  We just had a court case in the UK where Uber won in a court appeal.
[03:28:18.512 --> 03:28:27.375]  They said that if they'd lost the case, the company would have been forced to change its service to comply with rules that protect the black cab drivers.
[03:28:27.956 --> 03:28:29.876]  Rules that protect the black cab drivers.
[03:28:30.557 --> 03:28:33.538]  They are not being protected by these rules anymore.
[03:28:34.238 --> 03:28:35.181]  They used to have protection.
[03:28:35.562 --> 03:28:39.391]  That's the danger of the protection racket that we call the government.
[03:28:39.872 --> 03:28:42.198]  When you go in and you buy protection from the government...
[03:28:42.932 --> 03:28:49.117]  You're always subject to losing your position if there's some other crook that comes in and offers them a better deal.
[03:28:49.437 --> 03:28:55.121]  And what Uber is offering the government, they can't match that with the taxis.
[03:28:55.161 --> 03:29:01.306]  Because Uber is offering them control of your transportation, information about everything you do.
[03:29:01.446 --> 03:29:06.630]  And that is more valuable to the government than the money that they take from the taxi drivers.
[03:29:06.630 --> 03:29:16.955]  You know, if you go into New York City, the taxi drivers have to pay in some cases about a half a million dollars for a medallion if they want the full capability to go to airports and that sort of thing.
[03:29:17.515 --> 03:29:21.357]  They are taxed at a much higher rate, regulated at a much higher rate.
[03:29:21.377 --> 03:29:26.400]  When I was in Washington, we did that report talking to a taxi driver there, how he was
[03:29:27.020 --> 03:29:42.167]  Getting an immense double standard there in the city of Washington, how they had to go through all kinds of specialized instructions, inspections, licensing, and they had their own branch of police that would monitor the taxi drivers there, Uber.
[03:29:42.907 --> 03:29:44.968]  Got through without any of that kind of legislation.
[03:29:45.368 --> 03:29:48.350]  Because they're going to offer control to the government.
[03:29:48.870 --> 03:29:52.692]  And Uber sees himself as the person who is going to control all cars.
[03:29:52.732 --> 03:29:54.433]  He says private ownership is going to go away.
[03:29:54.453 --> 03:29:57.194]  He will be Uber always.
[03:29:57.454 --> 03:29:58.435]  Stay with us when we come back.
[03:29:58.455 --> 03:30:00.956]  We're going to talk about Obama's move to protect Hillary Clinton.
[03:30:00.976 --> 03:30:02.437]  The empires on the run.
[03:30:03.357 --> 03:30:06.039]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.267 --> 03:30:10.988]  This is Joe Biggs
[03:30:30.708 --> 03:30:39.092]  Increasingly turning to other proposals such as restricting ammunition, magazine rounds, and narrowing the ability to wield weapons.
[03:30:39.473 --> 03:30:53.520]  California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, who is running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 2018, released a statewide ballot campaign Thursday to require background checks for ammunition purchases.
[03:30:53.900 --> 03:30:58.783]  Why is it that we have background checks for guns but not background checks for ammunition?
[03:30:58.923 --> 03:31:02.065]  It makes no sense, Mr. Newsom said at his press conference.
[03:31:02.245 --> 03:31:04.827]  Well, because it's ammunition, you a** clown!
[03:31:05.247 --> 03:31:08.269]  You can find more articles like this at InfoWars.com.
[03:31:10.029 --> 03:31:10.930]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[03:31:10.990 --> 03:31:11.390]  Good, brother.
[03:31:11.570 --> 03:31:13.311]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:31:13.511 --> 03:31:15.052]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:31:15.213 --> 03:31:19.235]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:31:19.255 --> 03:31:21.837]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[03:31:21.877 --> 03:31:24.099]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:31:24.299 --> 03:31:32.144]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[03:31:35.706 --> 03:31:37.207]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[03:31:37.248 --> 03:31:40.130]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[03:31:40.290 --> 03:31:41.651]  Saving a ton of money there.
[03:31:41.931 --> 03:31:47.735]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated.
[03:31:47.995 --> 03:31:49.596]  Or maximum potency.
[03:31:49.777 --> 03:31:59.925]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going, goes right to the source.
[03:31:59.985 --> 03:32:01.726]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[03:32:13.353 --> 03:32:21.358]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:32:21.598 --> 03:32:26.622]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[03:32:48.090 --> 03:32:51.231]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:32:51.371 --> 03:32:54.592]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:32:54.872 --> 03:32:56.653]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:32:56.853 --> 03:32:58.713]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:32:58.973 --> 03:33:00.834]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[03:33:28.104 --> 03:33:30.484]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[03:33:30.544 --> 03:33:31.245]  I'm David Knight.
[03:33:31.725 --> 03:33:37.226]  We're going to talk about what's going on with those damn emails, as Bernie Sanders said.
[03:33:37.266 --> 03:33:39.026]  We have an article up on Infowars.com.
[03:33:39.046 --> 03:33:44.607]  Mother Benghazi victim says, unlike Sanders, I am not sick and tired of Hillary's damn emails.
[03:33:44.647 --> 03:33:47.007]  That's a quote from Bernie Sanders in the debate.
[03:33:47.667 --> 03:33:49.128]  Says, I'm tired of hearing about your emails.
[03:33:49.148 --> 03:33:49.968]  Well, you know what, Bernie?
[03:33:50.588 --> 03:33:53.389]  You know that this is not about emails.
[03:33:53.869 --> 03:33:55.529]  It's about national security, stupid.
[03:33:56.621 --> 03:34:02.805]  Just like they said it's about the economy, stupid, when Bill Clinton was running, it's about national security, stupid.
[03:34:03.626 --> 03:34:14.053]  That has been the religion with which they have taken every one of our legal protections, all of our rights since 9-11 has been this religion of national security.
[03:34:14.753 --> 03:34:19.197]  Everyone bow down and worship to the secrecy of the national security state.
[03:34:19.638 --> 03:34:28.286]  Well, here's somebody who openly violates all of the rules and requirements of this sacred cow, and we can't be bothered with that.
[03:34:29.241 --> 03:34:29.742]  Well, fine.
[03:34:30.302 --> 03:34:32.124]  Then why don't you shut down the NSA?
[03:34:32.725 --> 03:34:34.406]  Why don't you shut down Homeland Security?
[03:34:34.587 --> 03:34:35.387]  I'll be fine with that.
[03:34:36.108 --> 03:34:44.116]  Let's give Hillary Clinton a pass, and we can shut down this massive surveillance state that you justify in the name of national security.
[03:34:44.697 --> 03:34:49.102]  Again, today we have Huma Abedin testifying before the Benghazi committee today.
[03:34:49.722 --> 03:34:51.664]  Now, that was the mother of the Benghazi victim.
[03:34:51.704 --> 03:34:53.025]  She says, I'd like to know about this.
[03:34:53.065 --> 03:34:54.246]  They have the committee there.
[03:34:54.426 --> 03:35:05.396]  And I have said, and we've had now two congressmen as part of that committee, have essentially said, indicated that this is about scoring political points.
[03:35:05.496 --> 03:35:06.577]  I believe that's true.
[03:35:06.837 --> 03:35:14.624]  I believe that they don't want to do anything to punish anybody in the Obama administration, no matter how illegal or unconstitutional the actions.
[03:35:15.345 --> 03:35:19.447]  They don't want to impeach Obama for violating the Constitution in any number of ways.
[03:35:19.467 --> 03:35:22.128]  They don't want to go after Eric Holder or Hillary Clinton.
[03:35:22.428 --> 03:35:23.289]  They give them a pass.
[03:35:23.329 --> 03:35:25.329]  They simply want to score political points.
[03:35:25.369 --> 03:35:26.050]  I understand that.
[03:35:26.690 --> 03:35:27.170]  I understand.
[03:35:27.190 --> 03:35:28.932]  The Democrats are right about that.
[03:35:29.152 --> 03:35:30.352]  Here's another example of that.
[03:35:30.813 --> 03:35:34.115]  Obama talks about Clinton's emails.
[03:35:34.515 --> 03:35:35.476]  This is the New York Times.
[03:35:35.496 --> 03:35:38.618]  He says, I don't think it poses a national security problem.
[03:35:38.658 --> 03:35:40.859]  He said that on 60 Minutes on Sunday.
[03:35:41.140 --> 03:35:45.503]  He said, this is not a situation in which America's national security was endangered.
[03:35:45.543 --> 03:35:49.405]  Essentially giving Clinton a pass on it just like Bernie Sanders.
[03:35:49.445 --> 03:35:53.328]  The Democrats are all closing ranks to protect each other politically.
[03:35:53.788 --> 03:35:56.630]  However, some in the FBI are pushing back on this.
[03:35:57.370 --> 03:36:11.860]  Ron Husko, a former senior FBI official who retired in 2014, now president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, said it is inappropriate for the president to quote suggest what side of the investigation he's on while the FBI is still investigating.
[03:36:12.301 --> 03:36:12.781]  Do you think?
[03:36:13.401 --> 03:36:14.182]  Do you think?
[03:36:14.582 --> 03:36:19.425]  I mean, this administration is so far beyond anything Nixon ever did.
[03:36:19.826 --> 03:36:24.389]  And so was the George Bush administration, the George W. Bush as well.
[03:36:25.606 --> 03:36:26.606]  But this is where we are.
[03:36:26.967 --> 03:36:40.593]  He says, injecting politics into what is supposed to be a fact-finding inquiry leaves a foul taste in the FBI's mouth and makes them fear that no matter what they find, the Justice Department will take the President's signal and not bring a case.
[03:36:41.273 --> 03:36:41.713]  Do you think?
[03:36:42.273 --> 03:36:42.674]  Do you think?
[03:36:43.354 --> 03:36:47.716]  I mean, they could find her standing over a dead body with a smoking gun and they wouldn't charge her.
[03:36:48.336 --> 03:36:49.897]  They didn't charge the banks!
[03:36:49.917 --> 03:36:52.258]  You remember Eric Holder's Too Big to Fail?
[03:36:53.638 --> 03:36:55.620]  Again, with Lonnie Brewer pushing that through.
[03:36:55.660 --> 03:37:03.885]  It's not in the best interest of the country to put anybody in these banks in jail or to give them personal fines.
[03:37:04.265 --> 03:37:14.731]  We'll just give a very small fine to the banking institution, but we're not going to pull its charter, even though they were caught multiple times laundering money for terrorist organizations, for drug cartels.
[03:37:14.751 --> 03:37:17.273]  Remember all the concern about El Chapo?
[03:37:18.502 --> 03:37:19.623]  Sinaloa drug cartel.
[03:37:19.983 --> 03:37:21.104]  He escaped from prison.
[03:37:21.524 --> 03:37:22.385]  He had this tunnel.
[03:37:22.685 --> 03:37:23.425]  We saw him again.
[03:37:23.445 --> 03:37:24.406]  They let him go again.
[03:37:24.626 --> 03:37:25.367]  All of this stuff.
[03:37:26.447 --> 03:37:34.973]  We had HSBC give him his own personal checkout window to launder money at their bank.
[03:37:35.193 --> 03:37:36.234]  The Sinaloa cartel.
[03:37:37.284 --> 03:37:42.629]  And we have our government essentially giving them a pass saying it's not in our best interest to prosecute them.
[03:37:42.989 --> 03:37:45.671]  So yeah, they're not going to prosecute Hillary Clinton.
[03:37:45.991 --> 03:37:51.836]  They're going to talk about how these are simply her personal emails and we don't need to be concerned about it.
[03:37:51.876 --> 03:37:55.479]  But we are getting some pushback from some good people in the FBI.
[03:37:55.880 --> 03:37:57.721]  Listen to this article from the Daily Mail.
[03:37:58.562 --> 03:38:03.025]  An FBI agent says she could be prosecuted just for failing to tell Obama.
[03:38:03.065 --> 03:38:10.931]  Federal law makes it a crime for security clearance holders to fail to tell superiors when gross negligence causes a security breach.
[03:38:11.792 --> 03:38:20.138]  So unless he was aware, that is the president, of what she was doing when she was doing it, it seems there could be a big legal problem for her.
[03:38:20.638 --> 03:38:26.283]  Well, again, that would be if we had an honest government, if we had an honest Department of Justice.
[03:38:26.623 --> 03:38:28.664]  And let me tell you about this double standard.
[03:38:29.025 --> 03:38:35.510]  Because it was a couple of months ago that I interviewed Thomas Drake, who was one of the four NSA whistleblowers.
[03:38:36.539 --> 03:38:47.110]  That talked about how the government was violating the Fourth Amendment by doing dragnet surveillance on everyone in violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA.
[03:38:47.670 --> 03:38:50.193]  They were actually using the FISA court as a beard.
[03:38:50.213 --> 03:38:53.276]  That's the way they pervert the authority.
[03:38:53.316 --> 03:38:54.497]  That's the way they pervert the law.
[03:38:55.538 --> 03:39:01.782]  Thomas Drake, William Binney that we've talked to as well, and others that we've talked to, they went through legal channels within the NSA.
[03:39:01.843 --> 03:39:02.923]  They weren't listened to.
[03:39:03.083 --> 03:39:05.205]  So they went to the Congress.
[03:39:05.225 --> 03:39:07.066]  The Congress didn't pay any attention either.
[03:39:07.827 --> 03:39:10.589]  Thomas Drake went to the press and gave them some information.
[03:39:10.609 --> 03:39:13.311]  Now he was prosecuted as punishment.
[03:39:14.042 --> 03:39:18.805]  They said that he had classified and unclassified documents that were in his possession.
[03:39:18.865 --> 03:39:20.566]  So they came after him with criminal charges.
[03:39:20.606 --> 03:39:23.948]  They dropped all those criminal charges the day the trial was to begin.
[03:39:24.228 --> 03:39:25.829]  It was simply a way to punish him.
[03:39:25.869 --> 03:39:26.690]  And they did punish him.
[03:39:27.370 --> 03:39:29.071]  They cost him his position there.
[03:39:29.111 --> 03:39:32.093]  He was a senior administrator there at the NSA.
[03:39:32.674 --> 03:39:33.974]  They cost him his job.
[03:39:33.994 --> 03:39:34.995]  They cost him his career.
[03:39:35.035 --> 03:39:36.156]  They cost him his savings.
[03:39:37.156 --> 03:39:57.765]  So he paid a dear price for being loyal to the Constitution, but he pointed out when he came on and talked to us, and there was a national press conference event today where whistleblowers as well as Jocelyn Radick, who has represented many of them, they were talking to the National Press Club and talking to them about
[03:39:58.345 --> 03:39:59.766]  What is happening with Hillary Clinton?
[03:40:00.026 --> 03:40:18.795]  Looking at the double standard that has been applied to NSA whistleblowers, understand that when Obama gives Hillary Clinton a pass on this, he has come after more whistleblowers and journalists using the 1917 Espionage Act than all the presidents before him since 1917.
[03:40:19.696 --> 03:40:27.660]  As a matter of fact, he's done, I think it is, it's either two or three times the number of all of the previous presidents combined.
[03:40:28.467 --> 03:40:29.908]  So that's been a favorite tool of his.
[03:40:30.209 --> 03:40:36.354]  He loves to come after whistleblowers, he loves to come after journalists, but he won't come after a Democrat president candidate.
[03:40:36.975 --> 03:40:37.876]  That's the issue here.
[03:40:38.156 --> 03:40:43.861]  Now, under the law, under Section F, the information does not have to be classified to count as a violation.
[03:40:44.722 --> 03:40:48.407]  And I am reading this from an article that's put out by Fox News.
[03:40:48.447 --> 03:40:49.569]  This is Catherine Herridge.
[03:40:49.589 --> 03:40:57.859]  And I find it kind of ironic that Catherine Herridge, who has repeatedly used things to scare people about cyber espionage.
[03:40:57.899 --> 03:40:59.622]  I remember seeing her on Fox News.
[03:41:00.743 --> 03:41:05.966]  Talking to Greta Van Susteren about how we needed to have CISPA because of Stutznet.
[03:41:06.707 --> 03:41:08.908]  Because of the foreign threats like Stutznet.
[03:41:09.628 --> 03:41:17.373]  Everybody has known, it's been publicly made known for years that Stutznet was created by US and Israeli military intelligence to go after Iran.
[03:41:17.433 --> 03:41:20.695]  It was never a threat from us and as we know from Aaron Schwartz and others,
[03:41:21.235 --> 03:41:43.795]  The United States has been creating and funding most of these cyber threats, but of course they do it to scare us, just like the FBI will in many cases create these threats to tell us that we have to give up our rights because there's these terrorist groups that they come in, they create a patsy, they create the plot, they arm the plot, and then the last minute they shut it down and say, look, we caught somebody.
[03:41:43.835 --> 03:41:46.217]  Well, they just create the whole thing themselves.
[03:41:46.257 --> 03:41:49.000]  Nevertheless, let's talk about what is really at stake here.
[03:41:49.360 --> 03:41:54.185]  The documents do not have to even be classified to count as a violation.
[03:41:54.445 --> 03:41:57.208]  That has been Hillary Clinton's excuse all along.
[03:41:57.268 --> 03:41:59.951]  That was what Obama was essentially saying.
[03:41:59.971 --> 03:42:02.234]  He says, I don't think they affected national security.
[03:42:02.856 --> 03:42:07.279]  They were still classified documents but they don't even have to be classified documents.
[03:42:07.619 --> 03:42:22.028]  They say lawful possession of national defense information by security clearance holder who through gross negligence such as the use of an unsecure computer network permits the material to be removed or abstracted from its proper and secure location.
[03:42:22.668 --> 03:42:23.848]  That's what we're talking about here.
[03:42:24.669 --> 03:42:27.430]  And that's, of course, been her defense, that this is not classified.
[03:42:27.450 --> 03:42:36.453]  Thomas Drake, NSA whistleblower, indicted in 2010 under the Espionage Act for sharing unclassified material.
[03:42:37.374 --> 03:42:38.514]  These were a couple of documents.
[03:42:38.554 --> 03:42:39.835]  I mean, this is the kind of stuff like...
[03:42:41.235 --> 03:42:43.217]  Duck and cover type of documents.
[03:42:43.257 --> 03:42:44.538]  It was like training stuff.
[03:42:45.319 --> 03:42:46.520]  One of them, I think, was classified.
[03:42:46.540 --> 03:42:47.781]  They removed the classification.
[03:42:47.801 --> 03:42:49.222]  Another one was classified afterwards.
[03:42:49.342 --> 03:42:54.947]  But they had undocumented, unclassified documents that they came after him as well.
[03:42:55.007 --> 03:42:59.150]  So he was, they came after him for both of these issues.
[03:42:59.871 --> 03:43:07.337]  And again, he says, this is the Secretary of State, one of the most targeted individuals by other intelligence entities and agencies in the world.
[03:43:08.138 --> 03:43:20.308]  And she is using a private server to traffic highly sensitive information, no doubt including classified information, no doubt including information about sources and methods, said Thomas Drake, NSA whistleblower.
[03:43:20.949 --> 03:43:28.755]  He added, whistleblower's treatment shows that there is one law for the average citizen, and apparently a different set of rules for the rich and powerful.
[03:43:29.075 --> 03:43:32.858]  He says, but hey, I'm Secretary of State, he said in a sarcastic tone.
[03:43:33.419 --> 03:43:36.201]  Even Obama has given her cover, and that was on Sunday.
[03:43:37.342 --> 03:43:49.194]  As another example, former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling also went to Congress with his complaints, but he was sentenced in May to three and a half years in prison for violating, again, the 1917 Espionage Act.
[03:43:51.533 --> 03:44:01.940]  He was giving classified information to a New York Times reporter, but he was also convicted of an obstruction of justice charge because a single email was missing from his account.
[03:44:02.740 --> 03:44:05.782]  Even though the government could not show that he was responsible for that.
[03:44:06.162 --> 03:44:07.143]  So they're investigating him.
[03:44:08.362 --> 03:44:11.044]  And they say, well wait a minute, there's an email that's missing here.
[03:44:11.104 --> 03:44:13.966]  We think that maybe you might have deleted that email.
[03:44:14.066 --> 03:44:19.529]  So they add an obstruction of justice account to this CIA officer's thing.
[03:44:19.569 --> 03:44:24.012]  Now understand, there are 30,000 emails missing from Clinton.
[03:44:25.225 --> 03:44:27.066]  Okay, no obstruction of justice charge.
[03:44:27.446 --> 03:44:28.086]  Nothing to see.
[03:44:28.426 --> 03:44:29.046]  Move along.
[03:44:29.407 --> 03:44:30.567]  This is Hillary Clinton.
[03:44:30.607 --> 03:44:32.528]  We can't be bothered with that sort of thing.
[03:44:33.328 --> 03:44:38.430]  And again, Jessalyn Radek, whistleblower, former ethics advisor to the Department of Justice.
[03:44:38.490 --> 03:44:45.152]  As a matter of fact, they also came after her at one point in time because she was a whistleblower, but she also defends whistleblowers.
[03:44:45.173 --> 03:44:45.453]  She says,
[03:44:46.573 --> 03:44:56.837]  Yeah, so they have one standard for a CIA whistleblower, one standard for an NSA whistleblower, but a different standard if you're General Petraeus or if you're Hillary Clinton.
[03:45:16.658 --> 03:45:19.602]  Another example of how there are multiple standards.
[03:45:19.662 --> 03:45:25.609]  Again, there was this article that we had on Infowars.com yesterday about Ron Paul accusing the Feds of trying to hurt Rand's campaign.
[03:45:26.751 --> 03:45:30.235]  He testified on the stand and in court said that.
[03:45:31.175 --> 03:45:41.708]  He said, he went on the stand and he said that they released these claims one day, one day before the first GOP debate.
[03:45:41.928 --> 03:45:50.017]  Understand, they had this information for four years, but they waited until the day before the debate so they could smear Rand Paul.
[03:45:51.212 --> 03:45:54.357]  Ron Paul said, I don't consider that to be a coincidence.
[03:45:54.778 --> 03:45:58.484]  I consider that to be more than just seeking justice.
[03:45:59.185 --> 03:46:01.749]  And you have to understand, when you look at the details of this,
[03:46:03.154 --> 03:46:03.594]  That the U.S.
[03:46:03.634 --> 03:46:12.222]  District Judge has now dismissed all charges against one of the people involved with the campaign, John Tate.
[03:46:12.402 --> 03:46:13.623]  He was a campaign manager.
[03:46:14.243 --> 03:46:20.829]  And they've dismissed, the judges dismissed several charges against Jesse Benton, who was campaign manager.
[03:46:22.573 --> 03:46:31.123]  The only charge that they're still coming after Jesse Benton for is saying that he lied to the FBI because he denied knowledge of some emails.
[03:46:31.284 --> 03:46:32.285]  Again, we're back at emails.
[03:46:32.325 --> 03:46:34.648]  Hey, they're just emails, Bernie, would say.
[03:46:34.668 --> 03:46:36.350]  I don't care about emails.
[03:46:36.370 --> 03:46:40.074]  Well, you know, the FBI cares about emails when it's looking at the Ron Paul campaign.
[03:46:40.635 --> 03:46:45.137]  And they pointed out, how many of you remember what you paid on your taxes last year?
[03:46:45.237 --> 03:46:46.198]  Said his defense attorney.
[03:46:46.458 --> 03:46:47.038]  Asked the jurors.
[03:46:47.258 --> 03:46:52.141]  How many of you can remember that email that you got from your son's teacher two years ago?
[03:46:52.941 --> 03:46:55.502]  So when the FBI calls me, they say, well, you remember this email?
[03:46:55.542 --> 03:46:56.643]  No, I don't remember email like that.
[03:46:56.783 --> 03:46:57.363]  Ah, gotcha.
[03:46:57.783 --> 03:46:58.624]  You lied to us.
[03:46:59.753 --> 03:47:01.033]  And we're going to send you to jail.
[03:47:01.774 --> 03:47:04.554]  That's the kind of political persecution that they're going after.
[03:47:04.594 --> 03:47:20.298]  So, when Hillary Clinton has her own personal server where she's got confidential statements that have been made by foreign heads of state or other ambassadors on there, as well as classified information, when she destroys 30,000 emails, not a problem.
[03:47:22.779 --> 03:47:35.611]  But if you have a single email that is missing because you're a whistleblower, or if they ask you a question and you don't remember and you give an incorrect answer, then the FBI will come after you if you're Ron or Rand Paul.
[03:47:35.671 --> 03:47:38.274]  They will use that to smear you before the debates.
[03:47:38.474 --> 03:47:40.035]  That's the double standard that we have.
[03:47:40.436 --> 03:47:46.702]  Just like we're talking about the double standard with taxi drivers when we're looking at that situation in Washington.
[03:47:47.402 --> 03:47:51.846]  It's a perfect example of the kind of barriers of competition that they put up to people.
[03:47:51.886 --> 03:48:00.534]  We shot pictures in Philadelphia of all the barriers that they put down the center of the street, and then cross barriers, concrete barriers that they put.
[03:48:00.554 --> 03:48:10.243]  So they had metal barriers going down the lanes, multiple rows of barriers so people couldn't move, and then barriers to keep people on the sidewalks, and then every block or two,
[03:48:11.204 --> 03:48:17.253]  They would have massive concrete barriers to keep cars or vehicles or people from getting into a street.
[03:48:17.994 --> 03:48:19.115]  That's for you.
[03:48:19.375 --> 03:48:22.660]  That's not for the Pope that they were protecting in Philadelphia.
[03:48:22.680 --> 03:48:25.884]  And so in the same way, as I pointed out in that report,
[03:48:27.159 --> 03:48:33.341]  Uber and the government put all kinds of barriers in front of small businesses, individuals like taxi drivers.
[03:48:34.002 --> 03:48:45.166]  They give them all kinds of rules, regulations, licensing fees that are massive that they don't put in the way of those that they want to protect, that they want to enable, like the CEO of Uber.
[03:48:45.706 --> 03:48:48.027]  That's the double standard that we see going everywhere.
[03:48:48.067 --> 03:49:05.595]  So if you think this is only affecting the rich and powerful, if you think that politics doesn't affect you, understand that they don't even consider you to be a stakeholder who should know anything about the massive reorganization of our economy, of our government, into a global governance.
[03:49:05.675 --> 03:49:10.397]  That's what Senator Sessions said when he saw the TPP, saw the TTIP.
[03:49:10.437 --> 03:49:13.439]  He said, this is creating global governance.
[03:49:14.099 --> 03:49:16.941]  He actually took the time to go in and read it.
[03:49:17.601 --> 03:49:18.322]  The only one.
[03:49:18.342 --> 03:49:26.306]  The only senator, the only congressman who actually went in, took the time to read this, and gave a detailed report about what he saw.
[03:49:26.426 --> 03:49:31.690]  The rest of them could care less, and we don't know the precise details, even though it's been done for two weeks.
[03:49:32.130 --> 03:49:36.072]  They told us, we can't tell you any details about this because we're negotiating a trade agreement.
[03:49:36.112 --> 03:49:38.674]  We never talk about a trade agreement whilst being negotiated.
[03:49:38.714 --> 03:49:40.035]  Well, now they say they have finished it.
[03:49:40.919 --> 03:49:41.499]  Two weeks ago.
[03:49:42.040 --> 03:49:42.880]  But we still can't know.
[03:49:43.460 --> 03:49:45.101]  Because we're not stakeholders.
[03:49:45.281 --> 03:49:46.562]  The stakeholders know what's in it.
[03:49:46.902 --> 03:49:49.464]  The stakeholders have complained about some of the provisions that are in it.
[03:49:49.904 --> 03:49:51.585]  But we, the people, don't know.
[03:49:51.685 --> 03:49:55.667]  Because there's a different standard for us than there is for everybody else.
[03:49:56.496 --> 03:50:04.084]  Now there's also another very troubling article that came up today and Joe Biggs has been talking about this in the news update that we run at the breaks.
[03:50:05.045 --> 03:50:06.887]  Talking about the move towards ammunition control.
[03:50:07.548 --> 03:50:12.834]  This has been something that the Obama administration has been very cleverly doing from the very beginning of their administration.
[03:50:13.494 --> 03:50:18.015]  Now they're talking about doing this in California.
[03:50:18.355 --> 03:50:20.436]  New York already passed a law to do this.
[03:50:21.016 --> 03:50:25.377]  They found that they didn't really have the capability to execute it.
[03:50:26.097 --> 03:50:32.238]  This was done as part of the 2013 SAFE Act in New York, required instant ammunition background checks.
[03:50:32.318 --> 03:50:42.501]  But the governor there, Andrew Cuomo, who certainly is no fan of the Second Amendment, he says we need to shut the government down until we shut down people's gun rights.
[03:50:43.061 --> 03:50:48.024]  He suspended that provision in July, said that they didn't have the capability to actually do it.
[03:50:48.124 --> 03:50:56.028]  So now we've got someone who's Lieutenant Governor in California saying New York tried it, but California is going to do it, said Mr. Newsom.
[03:50:56.068 --> 03:51:00.650]  And we're going to talk about how they're going to do it, what that means to you when we come back.
[03:51:00.690 --> 03:51:01.591]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:51:10.339 --> 03:51:14.503]  Do you lay awake at night and worry about the health and safety of you and your loved ones?
[03:51:14.723 --> 03:51:18.566]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[03:51:18.806 --> 03:51:23.911]  How can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens that are beginning to emerge in the world today?
[03:51:24.271 --> 03:51:27.373]  Give yourself peace of mind with Supernatural Silver.
[03:51:27.834 --> 03:51:34.740]  Supernatural Silver is turning heads around the world as a new weapon in the fight against bacteria, viruses, and fungus.
[03:51:35.340 --> 03:51:43.124]  Supernatural silver can be taken internally or used topically to help the body's own immune system fight off disease much more effectively.
[03:51:43.584 --> 03:51:50.167]  Supernatural silver has been tested at independent universities and laboratories around the world and has been proven to be safe and effective.
[03:51:50.367 --> 03:51:53.690]  And highly effective against some of the planet's deadliest pathogens.
[03:51:54.270 --> 03:51:58.854]  There is no better product to have in your home for daily use or emergency preparedness.
[03:51:59.254 --> 03:52:09.563]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com, use the code SILVER2015 for 20% off and give yourself and your loved ones a fighting chance with Supernatural Silver.
[03:52:10.422 --> 03:52:14.528]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[03:52:14.688 --> 03:52:18.893]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[03:52:18.953 --> 03:52:26.143]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[03:52:26.283 --> 03:52:36.809]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[03:52:36.970 --> 03:52:40.292]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[03:52:40.432 --> 03:52:41.432]  What do you have to lose?
[03:52:41.572 --> 03:52:44.274]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and
[03:52:44.394 --> 03:52:49.876]  You're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[03:52:49.996 --> 03:52:53.197]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[03:52:53.297 --> 03:52:57.339]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[03:52:57.439 --> 03:52:59.579]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[03:52:59.759 --> 03:53:06.722]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:53:10.223 --> 03:53:14.464]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[03:53:14.664 --> 03:53:18.545]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[03:53:18.705 --> 03:53:25.886]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s, and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[03:53:26.066 --> 03:53:31.087]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[03:53:31.307 --> 03:53:39.269]  If you want to boost your omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[03:54:09.889 --> 03:54:09.980]  Yeah.
[03:54:22.628 --> 03:54:23.868]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:23.928 --> 03:54:26.689]  I'm David Knight, and joining me in this segment is Leanne McAdoo.
[03:54:26.709 --> 03:54:29.110]  We're going to talk about what's coming up on the nightly news tonight.
[03:54:29.810 --> 03:54:32.951]  As we went to break, we were talking about the article on Infowars.com.
[03:54:33.451 --> 03:54:37.632]  Ammo control picks up steam among Democrats aiming to limit gun access.
[03:54:37.692 --> 03:54:44.093]  And this is California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, who is going to run for governor of California in 2018.
[03:54:44.594 --> 03:54:48.795]  He says, why is it that we have background checks for guns, but not background checks for ammunition?
[03:54:48.855 --> 03:54:49.935]  It makes no sense, he says.
[03:54:50.595 --> 03:55:00.149]  Well, they tried it and were not able to actually execute it in New York, but this is something that the liberals have been doing since the beginning of the Obama administration.
[03:55:00.409 --> 03:55:06.558]  Right after Obama took office, they suspended the brass recycling program for the military.
[03:55:07.259 --> 03:55:12.802]  And if you don't know what that is, the military makes its own ammunition and of course they expend quite a bit of it as they train.
[03:55:13.282 --> 03:55:18.305]  The empty shells they would recycle and sell back into the domestic civilian market.
[03:55:18.945 --> 03:55:20.646]  And Obama stopped that practice.
[03:55:20.706 --> 03:55:25.829]  It was restarted by the Senators in protest and yet we still heard several years later
[03:55:26.469 --> 03:55:34.415]  In 2012 that some locations like Fort Drum and New York were crushing the brass and selling it at a much cheaper rate.
[03:55:34.435 --> 03:55:42.541]  It's not a good deal for the government and it is violating the law as well, but doing it nevertheless to keep that off of the marketplace.
[03:55:42.602 --> 03:55:51.548]  Then we found that there were billions of rounds of ammunition being purchased by Homeland Security out of the civilian market, which created all kinds of ammunition shortages.
[03:55:51.969 --> 03:55:54.631]  Now they want to put background checks in here because they understand
[03:55:55.091 --> 03:55:59.136]  That if you don't have ammunition, your gun is nothing but a club.
[03:55:59.737 --> 03:56:03.101]  That is the essential way of doing gun confiscation.
[03:56:03.662 --> 03:56:05.364]  To take away your ammunition.
[03:56:06.125 --> 03:56:12.713]  Now, as we look at that, again, remember that Obama, who was grandstanding about this shooting in Oregon, remember that two days later,
[03:56:13.706 --> 03:56:17.569]  They shot up a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders for over a half hour.
[03:56:17.889 --> 03:56:18.970]  They knew about this hospital.
[03:56:19.210 --> 03:56:20.391]  They changed their story.
[03:56:20.471 --> 03:56:25.755]  Four different stories in four days in a row, just like Benghazi, constantly changing the story.
[03:56:26.116 --> 03:56:31.360]  But of course, we can't be bothered in the American press to be worried about that because no Americans died.
[03:56:31.380 --> 03:56:36.404]  I guess it doesn't really matter when you're burning patients to death in their beds if they're not American patients.
[03:56:36.824 --> 03:56:46.431]  But now we have a new update from AP today saying that special operations analysts had assembled a dossier that included maps with the hospital circled.
[03:56:46.771 --> 03:56:50.834]  That would verify what Doctors Without Borders had been saying, that this is well known.
[03:56:51.075 --> 03:57:04.885]  They had identified the place multiple times, given the exact GPS coordinates to the governments, and yet it was deliberately targeted because they were looking to track a Pakistani operative.
[03:57:05.305 --> 03:57:07.927]  That is a violation of Geneva Convention.
[03:57:07.987 --> 03:57:13.831]  That is a violation of international law if you bomb a hospital because there's some people in there that you want to get.
[03:57:14.731 --> 03:57:18.114]  So, Leanne, tell us what's coming up tonight on the nightly news.
[03:57:19.005 --> 03:57:26.167]  Well, we're going to wrap up our interview with Brandy Vaughn looking into what's really behind this push for mandatory vaccinations.
[03:57:26.547 --> 03:57:27.828]  Key information there.
[03:57:28.588 --> 03:57:34.810]  Mikhail Thelin just came out with an article, middle school assignment, would you save whites or blacks from a sinking ship?
[03:57:34.850 --> 03:57:38.711]  So obviously that has nothing to do with any history that anyone would need to know.
[03:57:39.031 --> 03:57:42.015]  Talk about how, just blatant pushing of racism.
[03:57:42.456 --> 03:57:42.656]  Right.
[03:57:42.756 --> 03:57:46.721]  Not treating people, let's not consider anybody to be human beings.
[03:57:47.022 --> 03:57:47.162]  Right.
[03:57:47.202 --> 03:57:49.906]  Let's focus on them being white or black.
[03:57:50.026 --> 03:57:51.087]  Whether or not you're going to save them.
[03:57:51.207 --> 03:57:52.409]  And there's no differentiation.
[03:57:53.130 --> 03:57:55.994]  What if it was a black conservative, you know?
[03:57:56.254 --> 03:57:57.134]  They don't say anything like that.
[03:57:57.174 --> 03:57:58.775]  There's also an article up on InfoWars.
[03:57:58.795 --> 03:58:02.877]  A teacher tells a 13-year-old black conservative he's not worth saving in a fire.
[03:58:03.238 --> 03:58:05.719]  So I guess it just sort of depends on what your politics are.
[03:58:05.779 --> 03:58:09.661]  If your ideology isn't aligned with the establishment, you're fine.
[03:58:10.461 --> 03:58:11.142]  We'll save you.
[03:58:11.662 --> 03:58:15.344]  But the rest of the people are going to be rounded up, you know, as domestic extremists.
[03:58:15.744 --> 03:58:15.984]  Wow.
[03:58:16.385 --> 03:58:16.585]  Wow.
[03:58:16.945 --> 03:58:18.145]  Absolutely insane.
[03:58:18.185 --> 03:58:19.526]  But that's coming up tonight.
[03:58:20.307 --> 03:58:21.087]  7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:21.167 --> 03:58:21.467]  Eastern.
[03:58:21.487 --> 03:58:24.089]  Leanne McAdoo is going to be hosting the nightly news.
[03:58:24.149 --> 03:58:24.689]  Join us then.
[03:58:52.989 --> 03:58:53.940]  This is GCN.
