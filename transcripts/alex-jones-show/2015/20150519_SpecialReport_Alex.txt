[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.381]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:19.645]  Now today I had a video sent to me multiple times by different people showing a convoy in South Carolina traveling southbound on I-95.
[00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:28.669]  Okay, so these are troops that are on a convoy in South Carolina.
[00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.931]  It's military operations.
[00:00:33.131 --> 00:00:35.012]  Look at all of these tanks.
[00:00:36.114 --> 00:00:38.676]  On Interstate 95 South.
[00:00:39.097 --> 00:00:40.998]  I mean, this is like a war zone.
[00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:42.520]  What is going on here?
[00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:45.882]  What is going on here?
[00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:47.103]  This is nothing unusual.
[00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:49.085]  This has nothing to do with Jade Helm.
[00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:56.071]  I can just tell you from my time at Fort Bragg, it's not going to be unlikely in that area to see convoys driving up and down that road.
[00:00:56.511 --> 00:01:00.515]  The thing is, though, is a lot of people are concerned about the upcoming Jade Helm exercises.
[00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:04.138]  They'll be conducted over eight weeks in five different states.
[00:01:04.878 --> 00:01:28.318]  So the way the military works is they're going to conduct these operations at the time they say in those areas there is normal military training that happens on these roads and the reason being is when I was at Fort Bragg we would actually get on 95 and drive south and spread our vehicles out to see how the communications systems that we had our radios see if they were linked up good if they worked if our headsets worked
[00:01:28.818 --> 00:01:30.279]  And simply that's all this is.
[00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.161]  This has nothing to do with Jade Helm whatsoever.
[00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:33.282]  These aren't tanks.
[00:01:33.422 --> 00:01:39.627]  These look like strikers without the cages on the side for the stop RPGs.
[00:01:40.208 --> 00:01:44.151]  These are just regular strikers driving up and down the road and you can see the guys sticking out.
[00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:48.955]  They all have the helmets on with the mouthpieces and they're simply doing communications checks.
[00:01:49.555 --> 00:01:49.835]  I don't know.
[00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:12.789]  It'll hit that one vehicle and that amount of personnel inside that vehicle.
[00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.075]  Whereas if you bunch up your vehicles, one RPG shot, one IED, whatever it may be, can take out multiple vehicles.
[00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:29.561]  And that's why you have to spread out over a long stretch of road, which would make your communications equipment deteriorate in a sense.
[00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:32.763]  So all they do is they drive up and down the road, do commo checks.
[00:02:33.283 --> 00:02:35.104]  And make sure that this stuff is working.
[00:02:35.144 --> 00:02:36.365]  So there's nothing to worry about with this.
[00:02:36.405 --> 00:02:39.447]  I don't think this has anything to do with Jade Helm whatsoever.
[00:02:39.807 --> 00:02:40.428]  Just be calm.
[00:02:40.448 --> 00:02:41.929]  Not everything you see has to do with that.
[00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:47.232]  I understand there's speculations with what's going on due to the flip-flopping of the architects of Jade Helm.
[00:02:47.813 --> 00:02:52.956]  Lying about the people coming to the government to get the property to be used.
[00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:54.277]  Saying there'll be no compensation.
[00:02:54.297 --> 00:02:55.538]  We're finding out that's all a lie.
[00:02:56.058 --> 00:02:59.100]  The fact that the army lied about the slideshow in the first place.
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.305]  So I understand people's concerns, but this is something that I would not be worried about.
[00:03:03.345 --> 00:03:04.747]  This is normal to see.
