[00:00:07.892 --> 00:00:10.695]  We've got a special guest and he's a very dangerous man.
[00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:14.979]  This is someone that you speak to on a weekly basis maybe?
[00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:16.280]  Yeah, we're good friends.
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.862]  So go ahead and introduce our guest.
[00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:24.208]  Well the reason why I say he's a dangerous man, and I personally don't think he's dangerous, but the federal government certainly does.
[00:00:24.508 --> 00:00:29.151]  And that's because of his ability to unite people of all color.
[00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:35.875]  And we've even got proof from his official FBI profile that says he's dangerous for that reason.
[00:00:36.295 --> 00:00:41.398]  And of course I'm talking about Larry Pinckney and he is a member of the original
[00:00:41.838 --> 00:00:42.599]  Good to have you.
[00:00:59.608 --> 00:01:01.409]  This is fantastic.
[00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:09.031]  And I want to also extend my kudos to Brother Joe, sitting there with you.
[00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:11.212]  But what can I say?
[00:01:11.272 --> 00:01:12.332]  Let's rock and roll.
[00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:13.892]  That's it.
[00:01:14.052 --> 00:01:15.353]  I'm ready to rock and roll too.
[00:01:15.413 --> 00:01:21.315]  But before we get started, I want to read the FBI profile they have on you.
[00:01:21.335 --> 00:01:24.676]  And this is, we obtained this from the Freedom of Information Act.
[00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:28.257]  This is what it says about our guest, Larry Pinckney.
[00:01:29.246 --> 00:01:37.370]  Pinckney is potentially dangerous due to his demonstrated ability to unify black and white.
[00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.771]  His associates are negro, white, and Chinese.
[00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:44.813]  Special attention is being given to neutralizing him.
[00:01:45.493 --> 00:01:46.254]  Cointelpro.
[00:01:47.134 --> 00:01:52.255]  The areas of sex and drugs appear to be the most effective ones to utilize.
[00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:58.697]  His habits in this area are unknown, but are being monitored with this objective.
[00:01:58.837 --> 00:01:59.237]  Wow!
[00:01:59.377 --> 00:02:05.198]  So, this was back during the Civil Rights Movement, but Larry, the more things change, the more they stay the same.
[00:02:05.218 --> 00:02:06.419]  That's right.
[00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.039]  That's absolutely correct.
[00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.960]  And what we really need to understand
[00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:13.162]  Well, I like it.
[00:02:13.202 --> 00:02:14.462]  You summed it up, Darren.
[00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:16.183]  You know, my brother, you said it.
[00:02:16.563 --> 00:02:22.305]  The more things change, the more they stay the same, if we allow them to be that way.
[00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:27.087]  And the reality is, COINTELPRO never died.
[00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:30.768]  The counterintelligence program never died.
[00:02:30.868 --> 00:02:37.391]  It still goes on, whether it's under NDAA, the Patriot Act, whatever you want, whatever name.
[00:02:38.223 --> 00:02:39.664]  Someone wants to put on it.
[00:02:40.024 --> 00:02:50.693]  The reality is that, in fact, in this 21st century, in the year 2015, it is far worse.
[00:02:52.014 --> 00:02:55.817]  I repeat, far worse than ever before.
[00:02:56.638 --> 00:03:00.481]  And we I'm not saying this to make anybody paranoid.
[00:03:00.561 --> 00:03:02.463]  No, this is not about being paranoid.
[00:03:02.703 --> 00:03:04.044]  Just be aware.
[00:03:04.881 --> 00:03:06.962]  You know, stop going for the ghost.
[00:03:07.022 --> 00:03:12.464]  Let's understand that this is not a government of, by, and for the people.
[00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:17.967]  This is a government of, by, and for the global elite and the corporations.
[00:03:18.107 --> 00:03:18.547]  That's right.
[00:03:18.627 --> 00:03:18.947]  All right?
[00:03:19.248 --> 00:03:22.169]  So, I just had to inject that.
[00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:32.969]  Well, that's right, and the government does not want to unite us, they want to divide us, and this is something... Well, you can see that with this whole Black Lives Matter thing.
[00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.572]  All it's done is divided the people here in America.
[00:03:35.912 --> 00:03:37.595]  You know, when I speak to a lot of my friends,
[00:03:39.798 --> 00:03:47.903]  We would sit there and go, I didn't even know there was racism between, you know, you and I. Now I have to specify, oh, my black friend, or, you know, my white friend.
[00:03:47.923 --> 00:03:51.045]  It used to just be, hey, my buddy, you know, Apollo.
[00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:53.886]  Apollo's one of my great friends that I grew up with.
[00:03:54.447 --> 00:03:57.188]  We DJ together in clubs, and now we have to specify stuff.
[00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.370]  And then if you bring up the, you know, the white, the black, then you're racist.
[00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.473]  So there's really this huge division, and the Obama administration's definitely been behind that.
[00:04:04.853 --> 00:04:09.097]  They haven't denied it in any kind of way, and they're pushing this racist agenda forward.
[00:04:09.117 --> 00:04:10.339]  What are your thoughts on that?
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.821]  Well, the bottom line is this.
[00:04:13.802 --> 00:04:20.890]  How can black lives matter if all lives don't matter?
[00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.491]  I mean, let's be honest.
[00:04:23.032 --> 00:04:24.433]  Stop shucking and jiving.
[00:04:25.174 --> 00:04:27.977]  How can black lives matter if all lives
[00:04:28.604 --> 00:04:30.164]  Don't matter, okay?
[00:04:30.624 --> 00:04:37.346]  The lives of my black, white, brown, red, and yellow brothers and sisters all matter.
[00:04:38.006 --> 00:04:46.047]  The name of the game is to divide, to control, to manipulate.
[00:04:46.767 --> 00:04:56.449]  So, and let's remember, uh, just a couple of weeks ago, the so-called leadership of Black Lives Matter sat down with who?
[00:04:57.551 --> 00:04:59.932]  Hillary the Butcher Clinton.
[00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:02.693]  Come on, let's get real.
[00:05:03.533 --> 00:05:21.779]  And we need to understand that we everyday ordinary black, white, brown, red, and yellow people, we are the only ones together, collectively, who are going to bring about effective systemic change.
[00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:22.499]  Only us.
[00:05:23.848 --> 00:05:25.690]  We need to get off the plantation.
[00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.711]  That's right, I said plantation.
[00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:34.034]  We need to get off the plantation because that's where the Democrats and the Republicans have us.
[00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:36.356]  They have us on the plantation.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.162]  It's time, as Thomas Jefferson said, for a revolution.
[00:05:41.182 --> 00:05:47.144]  He said, to quote him, every generation needs a new revolution.
[00:05:47.524 --> 00:05:52.426]  And the Democrats, in particular, are famous for that.
[00:05:53.146 --> 00:06:02.090]  I think that, you know, my brother Darren and I have talked a little bit about Lyndon Johnson and what Lyndon Johnson had to say.
[00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.851]  Darren, you might want to elaborate on that.
[00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:05.371]  I don't know.
[00:06:06.271 --> 00:06:15.462]  Well, Lyndon Johnson was infamously known for saying that he'll have those n-words voting Democrat for the next, what, 100 years, I think was the quote?
[00:06:16.123 --> 00:06:16.363]  Yeah.
[00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:17.284]  Yeah.
[00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:26.595]  I mean, you know, we need to understand that as long as we allow ourselves to be duped
[00:06:27.378 --> 00:06:28.519]  And that's what we're doing.
[00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:30.220]  We allow ourselves to be doomed.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:42.428]  When I wrote years and years ago, and I tried to warn people about this Barack Obama creature, they said, Oh, no, no, you don't understand.
[00:06:42.488 --> 00:06:43.409]  He's black.
[00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:45.190]  That's what they said.
[00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.850]  Right.
[00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:48.832]  And I said, you don't understand.
[00:06:49.553 --> 00:06:51.914]  Because you're acting like a damn fool.
[00:06:52.515 --> 00:06:55.497]  You need to pay attention to what
[00:06:56.292 --> 00:07:02.797]  A person is about, as Dr. King said, it's about character, not color.
[00:07:03.217 --> 00:07:05.579]  It's about character, not color.
[00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.001]  So, you know, here we are.
[00:07:08.021 --> 00:07:09.802]  We have that happening all over again right now.
[00:07:09.902 --> 00:07:12.204]  We have that same thing happening now with Hillary Clinton.
[00:07:12.464 --> 00:07:18.529]  You have these feminists, you have these women coming out and going, well, just because she's a female, they're going to vote for and completely ignore
[00:07:18.989 --> 00:07:20.390]  All the horrible things she's done.
[00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:21.952]  Like you said, you called her the butcher earlier.
[00:07:22.352 --> 00:07:25.494]  She is pretty much, I think, one of the most evil human beings out there.
[00:07:25.835 --> 00:07:28.156]  But people are going to look past that and the fact that she's a woman.
[00:07:28.437 --> 00:07:29.858]  We just had the first black president.
[00:07:29.878 --> 00:07:39.225]  Now we have to move to have the first woman president so we can progress on and completely ignore who she is as a person, which is what we should be paying attention to.
[00:07:39.505 --> 00:07:44.890]  Not what she looks like, not what genitalia she has, but who she is, her character, or lack thereof.
[00:07:45.663 --> 00:07:46.943]  That's right, that's right.
[00:07:47.424 --> 00:08:04.448]  And the fact is that irrespective of her, I like the way you put that genitalia, irrespective of what her gender may be, the reality is that she's Bloody Mary all over again.
[00:08:04.728 --> 00:08:06.629]  That's why I refer to her
[00:08:07.327 --> 00:08:11.690]  Deliberately, as Hillary the Butcher Clinton.
[00:08:11.951 --> 00:08:13.071]  Because she's a butcher!
[00:08:13.512 --> 00:08:14.733]  And let's understand that.
[00:08:15.053 --> 00:08:15.894]  How do you, what?
[00:08:16.074 --> 00:08:19.616]  Because she's a woman, she's gonna bomb people lovingly?
[00:08:20.477 --> 00:08:22.719]  She's gonna kill people gently?
[00:08:23.119 --> 00:08:24.100]  Dead is dead!
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.100]  Let's be real.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:34.748]  And, and, you know, Albert Einstein, I believe it was, said, I believe this quote, and I'm paraphrasing it, but he indicated that
[00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:52.983]  When we people, everyday people, when we people constantly repeat the same thing over and over and over again and expect a different result, that's insanity!
[00:08:53.684 --> 00:08:55.225]  That is insane!
[00:08:55.345 --> 00:08:57.247]  That is absolute madness!
[00:08:57.767 --> 00:09:04.553]  It is time for we the people, black, white, brown, red, and yellow people in this country
[00:09:05.464 --> 00:09:12.326]  To wake the heck up and understand that we need a real change.
[00:09:12.726 --> 00:09:17.448]  Get off the plantation, Democrat, Republican, get off the plantation.
[00:09:18.008 --> 00:09:19.148]  This is urgent.
[00:09:19.608 --> 00:09:22.289]  InfoWars means just what it says.
[00:09:23.155 --> 00:09:29.117]  It's about information, not propaganda in the negative sense of the word.
[00:09:29.538 --> 00:09:32.599]  But it's about information waking up.
[00:09:33.099 --> 00:09:37.161]  So by supporting, and by the way, nobody asked me to say this.
[00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:40.822]  Darren and Joe had no idea I was going to say what I'm saying right now.
[00:09:41.302 --> 00:09:41.622]  All right?
[00:09:41.922 --> 00:09:46.004]  But by supporting Infrawards, you know what you're really doing?
[00:09:46.864 --> 00:09:48.125]  You're supporting yourself.
[00:09:48.795 --> 00:09:50.218]  You're supporting the people.
[00:09:50.579 --> 00:09:58.676]  You're supporting what Thomas Jefferson and Malcolm X talked about as the much-needed revolution in this country.
[00:09:58.916 --> 00:10:00.018]  That's all I have to say.
