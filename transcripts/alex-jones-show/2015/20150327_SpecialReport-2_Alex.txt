[00:00:10.253 --> 00:00:12.775]  Jakari Jackson here for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:21.541]  Now I've reported on a lot of gun stories and I guess my unique position here at InfoWars allows me to be simultaneously a reporter as well as a pundit.
[00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:24.783]  But some people take offense to this, not so much my reporting.
[00:00:24.823 --> 00:00:28.025]  I'm sure they wouldn't give you their opinion of my reporting if they got a chance.
[00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:30.406]  But now we have an article out of Guns.com.
[00:00:30.907 --> 00:00:34.389]  Gun control group petitioned station to fire pro-gun reporter.
[00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.171]  And this is the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.
[00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:39.853]  They have an issue with one Emily Miller.
[00:00:40.813 --> 00:00:46.797]  And the coalition is basically saying that Emily is not a real reporter, she's a pundit because she has pro-gun views.
[00:00:47.277 --> 00:00:53.621]  And the group went on to say, by the standards of her profession, Emily Miller has no business calling herself a journalist.
[00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:55.201]  Miller's crusade against D.C.'
[00:00:55.181 --> 00:01:00.184]  's popular, democratically enacted gun laws has been a professional one since the beginning.
[00:01:00.584 --> 00:01:08.529]  At this point, the city's residents have no reasonable expectation that she will provide objective, impartial coverage on matters of concern to them.
[00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:15.654]  If Miller wishes to behave like a pundit and activist, then WTTG should replace her with a real journalist.
[00:01:16.094 --> 00:01:22.438]  Well, first of all, I would like to address this anti-gun group and tell them that yes, you are allowed to have opinions in the United States of America.
[00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:25.020]  Secondly, I would like to address something that they said.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.101]  Miller's crusade against D.C.'
[00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:32.705]  's popular, that's debatable, democratically enacted gun laws has been a professional one since the beginning.
[00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:40.228]  Well, this democratically enacted gun law, let's explore this statement, specifically with the case of D.C.
[00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:41.029]  v. Heller.
[00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:49.733]  The Supreme Court struck down provisions of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 as unconstitutional, and basically says that you can own a gun
[00:01:50.313 --> 00:02:02.643]  In the District of Columbia and actually it's my understanding that Miss Miller became a gun proponent or Second Amendment proponent as she likes to call herself because she realized how difficult it was to get a firearms license in the District of Columbia.
[00:02:03.063 --> 00:02:07.206]  And you guys probably recall Adam Kokesh being arrested for having a loaded shotgun.
[00:02:07.447 --> 00:02:14.072]  Well with the Firearms Act of 1975 being deemed unconstitutional, yes Adam Kokesh could have a loaded firearm
[00:02:14.312 --> 00:02:14.632]  We're good to go.
[00:02:43.417 --> 00:02:49.203]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
