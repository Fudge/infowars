[00:00:10.145 --> 00:00:13.067]  What's the real time?
[00:00:13.087 --> 00:00:13.067]  28.
[00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:13.387]  I'm 105.
[00:00:13.968 --> 00:00:17.510]  If you had as much time as I have, what would you do with it?
[00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:21.774]  If I had all that time, I sure as hell wouldn't waste it.
[00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:27.958]  The movie End Time seems to be a perfect metaphor for what's going on in our daily lives now.
[00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:36.905]  We don't seem to ever have enough time, even though with all this great technology and all these advances, we're still always running behind, trying to catch up, never getting enough done.
[00:00:38.012 --> 00:00:39.315]  Come on, come on, help yourselves!
[00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:40.398]  Take the time, it's free!
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.005]  You put enough time in the wrong hands.
[00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.529]  You upset the whole system.
[00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:45.111]  Let's hope so.
[00:00:45.987 --> 00:00:49.708]  Well, Google may have a solution for that, as they do for everything else.
[00:00:50.108 --> 00:00:54.189]  In fact, there's a Google executive that thinks we could live to be up to 500 years old.
[00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.351]  Bloomberg Business reported that Google Ventures' CEO is in the search for immortality.
[00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:09.074]  That's right, Bill Marris has up to $425 million a year that he could spend on venture projects out there, and he's looking for companies that will slow aging, reverse disease, and extend life.
[00:01:09.574 --> 00:01:15.056]  Google Ventures has close to $2 billion in assets under management with stakes in more than 280 startups.
[00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:26.559]  They fund things like Google Glass, driverless cars, SpaceX, and Google X is working on a pill that would insert nanoparticles into our bloodstream to detect disease and cancer mutations.
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.502]  But how will we pay for this immortality?
[00:01:29.762 --> 00:01:31.363]  And what will be the cost to you and I?
[00:01:31.764 --> 00:01:33.685]  Will it be through xenotransplantation?
[00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:40.211]  Where they take actual organs from aborted babies and grow them inside rats and other animals and then implant them into you?
[00:01:41.192 --> 00:01:44.455]  Do you want to be responsible for the death of another human being so you could live longer?
[00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.653]  Well, there's a biotech company in Redwood City, California, which is doing just that.
[00:01:50.313 --> 00:01:58.760]  The California company Ganogen removes the organs from aborted babies, transplants them into a rat or pig, and allows them to grow so they can be transplanted into a human.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.262]  Work has initially been done on kidneys.
[00:02:02.043 --> 00:02:05.246]  WorldNetDaily seems to be one of the only publications talking about this.
[00:02:05.646 --> 00:02:06.567]  They have a couple articles.
[00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:13.372]  One, scientists grow kidneys of aborted babies and animals, and an aborted baby organ program called FrankenScience.
[00:02:14.312 --> 00:02:18.295]  This is one way we're turning our children into commodities and they're not even being born yet.
[00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:22.477]  Now after they're born, we have the CPS that goes around and traffics children.
[00:02:22.658 --> 00:02:26.900]  In fact, Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services is under state investigation.
[00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:27.541]  The L.A.
[00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:35.086]  Department of Children and Family Services has been under fire in recent years with official commissions investigating high-profile deaths of children who come in contact with the foster care system.
[00:02:35.626 --> 00:02:47.254]  Investigators are looking into allegations that officials in Los Angeles DCFS office engaged in a series of baby trafficking activities and cover-up extending back 15 years involving possibly large numbers of babies.
[00:02:47.955 --> 00:02:49.376]  And these kids had a high price tag.
[00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:59.503]  They estimate that 21,000 kids that went through this system, they were getting $25,000 apiece for them and taking them out of the system and transferring them to families with these large fees.
[00:03:00.225 --> 00:03:05.786]  And so the supervisors are getting kickbacks, the employees are getting kickbacks, so what they need is more kids.
[00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:07.387]  So they go after your family.
[00:03:07.867 --> 00:03:09.367]  Oh, you don't want vaccines for your kids?
[00:03:09.407 --> 00:03:10.627]  Maybe we're going to call CPS.
[00:03:10.948 --> 00:03:15.749]  Oh, you don't want to treat your kid for eczema using the steroid cream like the CPS recommends?
[00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:17.029]  Well, we're going to take your kids.
[00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.430]  And that's what happened to a family in Washington State recently.
[00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.431]  They had a home birth of twins, and they didn't want to bring them to the doctor because they felt their kid's immune system hasn't been developed yet.
[00:03:25.851 --> 00:03:29.673]  Well, due to pressure from their family, they called the paramedics to come check on their kids.
[00:03:29.693 --> 00:03:32.435]  The paramedics said the kids are fine, but they recommend they bring them to a doctor.
[00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:35.357]  And they said, no, we're going to wait until their immune systems get better.
[00:03:35.597 --> 00:03:38.899]  Well, the next day, CPS shows up and goes, hey, your kid has eczema.
[00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:40.720]  We recommend this steroid cream.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.763]  And they go, well, we're treating it with natural antibiotics and creams like coconut oil.
[00:03:45.783 --> 00:03:48.685]  And they said, no, if you're not using the steroid cream, we're going to take your kids.
[00:03:48.925 --> 00:03:50.086]  So they took their kids for a while.
[00:03:50.366 --> 00:03:52.267]  Then they got them back, but now they're under investigation.
[00:03:52.287 --> 00:03:55.069]  They're under the heel of the CPS, and if they don't march,
[00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:58.551]  And cross every T and dot every I, they're going to come and take their kids.
[00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:01.833]  And because of that oppression, they decided to flee the state.
[00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:03.874]  Well, then they got busted down in California.
[00:04:04.314 --> 00:04:09.737]  And before being arrested, the mother, Carrie Ringo, actually told a cameraman, send a message to America for me.
[00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:11.578]  Children don't belong to the government.
[00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:13.079]  The government belongs to the people.
[00:04:14.195 --> 00:04:17.096]  When our children become commodities, it lessens their value.
[00:04:17.836 --> 00:04:19.597]  You can't put a value on human life.
[00:04:19.837 --> 00:04:20.537]  You really can't.
[00:04:21.117 --> 00:04:28.379]  Although they're trying to do that with this health care system where they're going to have to budget health care for you and we may have to create death panels.
[00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:30.680]  They're trying to put a price tag on human life.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.461]  They're trying to say some lives aren't worth as much as others.
[00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:40.063]  And pretty soon, hey, like Will.i.am said in Rolling Stone, eventually 3D printing will print people.
[00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:41.403]  In fact, here's his quote.
[00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:43.888]  You can print in freaking protein.
[00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:45.069]  You can make freaking meat.
[00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:46.230]  You can print leather.
[00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.251]  You can print a liver.
[00:04:47.872 --> 00:04:53.678]  So if you can print a liver or a kidney, god dang it, you're going to be able to print a whole freaking person and that's scary.
[00:04:54.554 --> 00:04:55.415]  Yeah, that is scary.
[00:04:55.775 --> 00:05:01.040]  We may split into that human species, that subservient class and that master class, a lot earlier than H.G.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.981]  Wells ever predicted.
[00:05:02.682 --> 00:05:09.067]  So try to remember that when you see headlines like Google Exec says we can live to be 500 or forever or we're going to merge with machines.
[00:05:09.488 --> 00:05:13.051]  Look at the human cost now and ask yourself, is it worth it?
[00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:15.994]  This has been Rob Doo for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
