[00:00:09.417 --> 00:00:14.522]  The global elite are saviors, are masters, are kings, queens, and presidents.
[00:00:14.782 --> 00:00:21.208]  Drafting a new world order in secret and publicly behaving like the privileged scumbags they truly are.
[00:00:21.608 --> 00:00:25.452]  Whether you're a banker, a sheik, or a connected politician.
[00:00:25.672 --> 00:00:28.193]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:00:28.493 --> 00:00:32.514]  One thing is for sure, the rules don't apply to you.
[00:00:32.995 --> 00:00:48.040]  The New York Post reports a Saudi Arabian prince is accused by three female staffers of acting like a bizarre party boy, engaging in a gay sex act in front of them, threatening a woman's life and declaring, I am a prince and I do what I want.
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:01:01.864]  CNN reports a Saudi prince is no longer facing felony assault charges, but could still face a misdemeanor as the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office reviews a woman's complaint that the royal tried to force her to perform a sex act on him.
[00:01:02.184 --> 00:01:15.609]  Prince Mahed Abdulaziz Al Saud, originally arrested on suspicion of sexual assault, false imprisonment, and battery, was released last month on $300,000 bail in connection with the September 23rd incident.
[00:01:17.062 --> 00:01:20.444]  The Saudi Prince is no longer facing felony assault charges.
[00:01:20.965 --> 00:01:25.008]  The case is now being evaluated for possible misdemeanor charges.
[00:01:25.488 --> 00:01:38.957]  You may remember back in 2011 French presidential candidate Chouin and former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was arrested and charged with an alleged sexual assault and attempted rape in a New York City hotel.
[00:01:39.217 --> 00:01:45.542]  Dominique Strauss-Kahn was only to be charged later and acquitted of aggravated pimping in France earlier this year.
[00:01:46.182 --> 00:01:51.387]  The 66-year-old admitted taking part in orgies, but denied knowing the women were prostitutes.
[00:01:51.627 --> 00:01:59.814]  Or the Delaware Court's decision to spare Robert H. Richards, the wealthy DuPont heir, an 8-year prison sentence because he would not fare well.
[00:02:00.274 --> 00:02:06.800]  After being convicted, Richards' 8-year prison sentence for raping his toddler daughter was suspended.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.582]  The elite live outside of law.
[00:02:09.102 --> 00:02:11.843]  And are creating a new world order from all directions.
[00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:15.843]  In the words of Lord Christopher Monckton, the world government is going to be created.
[00:02:15.983 --> 00:02:20.724]  The word government actually appears as the first of three purposes of the new entity.
[00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:26.266]  The second purpose is the transfer of wealth from the countries of the West to third world countries.
[00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:31.167]  And the third purpose of this new entity, this government, is enforcement.
[00:02:31.407 --> 00:02:37.188]  They are about to impose a communist world government on the world, warned Lord Monckton.
[00:02:37.864 --> 00:03:07.158]  They are coming from all sides, as is completely obvious to anyone with ears or eyes to hear or read, as the Department of Justice, rather than focusing on the numerous Islamic terror cells residing in the United States, or the threat crossing our borders, will instead focus on returning veterans, Christians, and gun owners, through their newly formed Domestic Terror Council, prosecuting anti-government and hate groups, regardless of the First Amendment.
[00:03:07.438 --> 00:03:19.867]  Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, who oversees national security at the Justice Department, announced the new position, the Domestic Terrorism Council, following a number of violent attacks or plots against the U.S.
[00:03:19.907 --> 00:03:29.414]  that he said were motivated by anti-government views, racism, bigotry and anarchy, and other despicable beliefs.
[00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:31.736]  This is how democracy dies.
[00:03:32.236 --> 00:03:37.459]  This is how ideas, opinions, and freedom are squashed in the noonday sun.
[00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:50.506]  This is how totalitarian criminals with zero real-world experience regarding their fellow human counterparts dismantle a government that has no room for their lunacy and cruelty.
[00:03:50.867 --> 00:03:52.968]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.512]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:04:06.532 --> 00:04:09.834]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:04:09.854 --> 00:04:11.574]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:04:11.614 --> 00:04:17.857]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:17.977 --> 00:04:23.859]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:27.763]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:04:27.963 --> 00:04:30.846]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:04:30.866 --> 00:04:39.055]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:41.378]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:04:41.438 --> 00:04:42.479]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:51.583]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
