[00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.781]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:15.288 --> 00:00:15.988]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.628 --> 00:00:17.669]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:19.509]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:20.969]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.630]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.951]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:31.592]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:40.294]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide today.
[00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:45.386]  It's already Thursday, the fifth day of February 2015.
[00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:51.887]  I'm your host Alex Jones, and we're coming to you from the Infowars.com studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:53.608 --> 00:00:55.488]  Wow, where to begin yet again?
[00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:57.549]  There is so much to get to.
[00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.871]  This whole Brian Williams shot down in the helicopter garbage has completely blown up in his face.
[00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:10.712]  And that just shows what a bunch of liars these people are.
[00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:14.110]  It's not really our top story, it just illustrates.
[00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:23.197]  No helicopter was shot down, it was all made up, just like Private Lynch, just like the Pat Tillman, just like the American Sniper.
[00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:26.180]  These stories are fables.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.941]  Now with Lynch, it's 100% fraud.
[00:01:28.842 --> 00:01:31.124]  With American Sniper, it looks like about 90% of it's true.
[00:01:32.164 --> 00:01:35.067]  But you still can't go around lying about people to make yourself look bigger.
[00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:40.317]  Um, and the military just would not go along with this.
[00:01:41.878 --> 00:01:42.998]  That is the actual soldiers.
[00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:47.061]  Just like Pat Tillman wouldn't go along with a bunch of lying about what he was really doing.
[00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:51.563]  He was not charging a bunch of Al Qaeda nests every day and, you know, this big hero.
[00:01:51.623 --> 00:01:54.944]  I mean, he was out there getting shot at, but he wouldn't go along with the lies, so they killed him.
[00:01:58.646 --> 00:01:59.287]  This is a big deal.
[00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:01.268]  We're going to go through the different clips
[00:02:02.264 --> 00:02:02.444]  Yes, sir.
[00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:22.574]  It's not like he lied about cheating on his wife or something.
[00:02:22.594 --> 00:02:23.474]  I'm not saying that's good.
[00:02:23.535 --> 00:02:25.216]  It's just that people can go, oh, I get that.
[00:02:25.837 --> 00:02:26.917]  You don't want to be a liar.
[00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.199]  You don't make stuff up on purpose.
[00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:29.600]  You just try to cover your butt.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.323]  To whole cloth make up that he's this big hero.
[00:02:34.204 --> 00:02:40.990]  Just like Hillary Clinton claimed that she was in a C-130 taking fire and getting shot up, there was no fire on the C-130.
[00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.571]  That letter came out from the cruise.
[00:02:43.232 --> 00:02:45.294]  And that's what's holding back so much of this tyranny.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:57.667]  Is the grassroots police, the grassroots military, the grassroots citizens, the people on the ground, in business, in academia, in life, will not go along with the BS.
[00:02:59.328 --> 00:03:10.694]  That's why they want to go to automated systems and drones and computers and robots doing most of the dirty work, because then they can compartmentalize it better and cover everything up.
[00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:13.316]  But that's a big deal that's coming up today.
[00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:20.030]  DOJ still won't admit if it took any action against NSA analysts spying on love interest.
[00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.011]  They admit it's a viral problem.
[00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:26.952]  People spying on their love interest or their business competitors or their neighbors.
[00:03:27.892 --> 00:03:37.756]  I mean obviously humans are fallible and we're going to abuse things and that's why you don't build a omnipresent surveillance grid because
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:56.394]  As top analysts have said on the show, including William Binney, it ends up destroying your national security because now that panopticonic surveillance system is going to be accessed by unsavory characters, foreign governments, you name it, for the highest bidder, and now there's a weapons system to take down society.
[00:03:56.935 --> 00:04:01.678]  You don't build the bomb that can destroy the world, you've already won the war.
[00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.963]  You don't build the panopticonic surveillance grid that the devil himself would love,
[00:04:08.223 --> 00:04:09.164]  And then you've won the war.
[00:04:09.384 --> 00:04:10.164]  But we've done it.
[00:04:11.205 --> 00:04:12.246]  It's got to be dismantled.
[00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:18.270]  There's now a global surveillance race with every major device coming out to surveil and spy on you by design.
[00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.712]  The genie can still be put back in the bottle.
[00:04:21.832 --> 00:04:22.733]  I don't think it is going to be.
[00:04:22.753 --> 00:04:23.814]  I'm going to be quite frank with you.
[00:04:24.294 --> 00:04:29.458]  At least those of us out here can get a jump on it all what's coming and be ready for it and not be caught flat footed.
[00:04:30.398 --> 00:04:32.019]  And quite frankly, even if you were a cynical
[00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.315]  Sociopath out there, you'd want to know all this info in Business and Life to be positioned to capitalize on it.
[00:04:39.955 --> 00:04:41.056]  And not in an immoral way.
[00:04:41.837 --> 00:04:44.480]  But, I mean, I don't intend to just sit here and go through all this.
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.881]  I'm going to capitalize on all of it.
[00:04:46.302 --> 00:04:55.491]  I'm going to fight it, try to shut it down, but I'm going to be ready to be positioned to dominate into the future so I can defend my family and everybody else.
[00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:58.352]  We need to gear up and get ready.
[00:04:58.392 --> 00:04:59.673]  We're the folks that know the answers.
[00:04:59.953 --> 00:05:01.935]  We're the people that warn the population.
[00:05:01.975 --> 00:05:02.755]  We're the patriots.
[00:05:03.035 --> 00:05:03.856]  We're the solution.
[00:05:04.056 --> 00:05:04.816]  And we're rising.
[00:05:04.856 --> 00:05:05.337]  Stay with us.
[00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:12.423]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:05:12.723 --> 00:05:20.727]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:25.990]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.671]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:06:09.167 --> 00:06:17.700]  What disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time?
[00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:24.671]  NASA has already set the countdown timer, and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[00:06:25.171 --> 00:06:28.614]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:29.855]  population could perish.
[00:06:30.296 --> 00:06:33.298]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:35.560]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.282]  Mass riots will follow.
[00:06:37.662 --> 00:06:39.384]  Ancient diseases will re-emerge.
[00:06:39.844 --> 00:06:43.367]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?

[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.842]  DarkestDays.info.

[00:07:09.068 --> 00:07:16.009]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:08:03.703 --> 00:08:04.043]  Silver Bullet.
[00:08:10.205 --> 00:08:15.287]  This is going to be the next big question for all these presidential candidates, how they feel about mandatory vaccines.
[00:08:15.447 --> 00:08:17.268]  It's time to get back in their face.
[00:08:17.568 --> 00:08:19.669]  They're trying to bully us into medical tyranny.
[00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:25.612]  I wanted to take issue with you anti-vaxxers, right-wingers, rednecks.
[00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:30.694]  It's about Big Brother, but on the other hand, some things do require some involvement of Big Brother.
[00:08:30.974 --> 00:08:34.896]  What gives you the right to tell me that I should get a shot, that my children should be shot?
[00:08:34.916 --> 00:08:37.857]  I don't think there's anything extraordinary about resorting to freedom.
[00:08:38.197 --> 00:08:41.339]  Hillary Clinton took to Twitter to voice her support for vaccinations.
[00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:43.360]  Meanwhile, the insert says it can make you get measles.
[00:09:00.825 --> 00:09:01.366]  Understand that?
[00:09:01.586 --> 00:09:08.933]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:09:08.953 --> 00:09:10.895]  But I think the parents should have some input.
[00:09:11.196 --> 00:09:13.098]  The state doesn't own your children.
[00:09:13.518 --> 00:09:16.181]  Parents own the children and it is an issue of freedom.
[00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:19.104]  But the 10% can't go to school unless they get vaccinated.
[00:09:19.124 --> 00:09:21.887]  The kinds of vaccines which work effectively
[00:09:22.587 --> 00:09:23.728]  100% of the time.
[00:09:24.068 --> 00:09:25.408]  And the White... Oh, wait a minute.
[00:09:25.489 --> 00:09:28.290]  I'm sorry, you haven't read the CDC memo, have you?
[00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:29.810]  It was 99% last week.
[00:09:29.831 --> 00:09:31.311]  Now they're telling people it's 97%.
[00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:34.613]  So, it's not 100% even by their own statistics.
[00:09:34.793 --> 00:09:39.455]  Meanwhile, the outbreak was caused by vaccinated people!
[00:09:39.735 --> 00:09:43.677]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:09:43.777 --> 00:09:45.578]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:09:47.349 --> 00:09:58.431]  You notice Hillary Clinton there used the same line they use about the Earth is round, the sky is blue, man-made global warming is real, all scientists agree it's real.
[00:09:59.071 --> 00:10:11.634]  And Al Gore says that, and Obama says that, and the vast majority of scientists have been canvassed in international studies, we've covered them, you can look them up, and don't believe man-made global warming is happening.
[00:10:13.442 --> 00:10:17.464]  I mean, Al Gore said that the entire northern ice cap would be gone by 2013.
[00:10:18.164 --> 00:10:23.067]  It's the largest ever recorded in 60 years of satellites.
[00:10:24.787 --> 00:10:26.708]  They say polar bears are about to go extinct.
[00:10:27.689 --> 00:10:31.451]  They're five times their numbers that they were again in the 1950s.
[00:10:32.271 --> 00:10:32.771]  Don't believe me?
[00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:40.375]  Just type in polar bear populations explode in northern Europe, Russia, and North America.
[00:10:42.844 --> 00:10:43.845]  Five times their numbers.
[00:10:44.565 --> 00:10:46.786]  They're just running around like roaches.
[00:10:47.427 --> 00:10:47.907]  Doesn't matter.
[00:10:48.007 --> 00:10:48.648]  They're all dead.
[00:10:48.808 --> 00:10:49.468]  Al Gore said so.
[00:10:49.488 --> 00:10:53.511]  Oh, and the CDC says it's 97% safe.
[00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:56.533]  That's all just total quack numbers.
[00:10:57.473 --> 00:11:02.636]  By the way, here's an article up on InfoWars.com linking directly through to the federal government's own data.
[00:11:03.057 --> 00:11:03.337]  U.S.
[00:11:03.377 --> 00:11:09.261]  government has paid out $3 billion to vaccine-injured Americans since 1989 as part of the secret court.
[00:11:10.154 --> 00:11:16.299]  Unless you live in a cave and have no access to television or the internet, you've likely been exposed to the measles mania that has swept America.
[00:11:16.679 --> 00:11:21.183]  Oh my gosh, no one's died, it's the end of the world, but arrest anybody that isn't vaccinated.
[00:11:22.924 --> 00:11:26.507]  Woman contracts polio virus from vaccinated infant.
[00:11:27.088 --> 00:11:29.790]  That story's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:33.093]  California bill with Nick's vaccine exemption.
[00:11:36.414 --> 00:11:49.360]  Meanwhile, 10 states suing over Obama's immigration actions find their senators on the opposite side, including Republican ones, because that's what the establishment wants, and what they tend to want, they tend to get.
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:59.345]  We'll continue today to follow this vaccine situation, and at the bottom of the hour, I want to play a special report
[00:12:00.745 --> 00:12:15.093]  Dealing with the denial and the propaganda used by socialists and communists that are basically the ground troops of the private central bankers who want to create a monopoly of socialism on the ground to make people dependent while they themselves are exempt.
[00:12:15.553 --> 00:12:25.399]  A few weeks ago, we had the leader of the Weather Underground on the broadcast, Bill Ayers, and he was worse than Sergeant Schultz that knows nothing.
[00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:26.899]  I know nothing!
[00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:27.500]  I know nothing!
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.281]  So he put together a video
[00:12:30.535 --> 00:12:34.720]  Breaking down the deceptions he's involved in.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:49.319]  And if you're a radio listener and you go to Infowars.com forward slash show, you can actually see the video because we'll show the police memorials and the state and federal websites that show the police officers that they did indeed bomb.
[00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:50.930]  It's well known.
[00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:53.512]  And then he said, I'm not a communist or a socialist.
[00:12:53.532 --> 00:12:57.214]  And we have him previously, 10 years ago, saying, I want to overthrow capitalism.
[00:12:57.534 --> 00:12:58.255]  I'm a communist.
[00:12:58.415 --> 00:13:02.177]  So the Weatherman leader came on and said he's not a communist.
[00:13:02.557 --> 00:13:06.960]  Because see, the talking point is communism doesn't exist.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.300]  Socialism doesn't exist.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:16.585]  Even as we have socialized government health care, giant screw job, even as they say our kids belong to the state, even as the president says, we're going to give you free health care.
[00:13:16.845 --> 00:13:17.566]  So that's coming up.
[00:13:18.542 --> 00:13:31.306]  Another extremely powerful report that was put together by Joe Biggs, Darren McBreen, and Leanne McAdoo and others really has high production value and it's satirical but based on real things that are happening.
[00:13:31.667 --> 00:13:33.667]  That video is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:35.908 --> 00:13:39.713]  We'll also get to how the elite plan to achieve digital immortality.
[00:13:39.733 --> 00:13:40.774]  They're now announcing that.
[00:13:41.415 --> 00:13:45.420]  Manufactured terror, not the economy, will dominate 2016 election.
[00:13:45.861 --> 00:13:46.622]  I tend to agree with Nemo.
[00:13:46.642 --> 00:13:53.130]  They're getting ready for some false flags or some provocateur garbage to open the gate up and let the jihadis they help fund the Middle East come in.
[00:13:54.124 --> 00:13:55.685]  That's not saying it's a pure false flag.
[00:13:55.725 --> 00:13:57.467]  They just are going to fund the enemy to attack us.
[00:13:58.327 --> 00:14:01.410]  Continuing, we're going to get, again, back to Joe Biggs' report.
[00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:06.334]  Car hacking, someone dies at the end, is the name of that powerful video.
[00:14:06.714 --> 00:14:10.717]  It's a great way to expose what these black boxes in the cars are really doing.
[00:14:11.778 --> 00:14:12.839]  That is all coming up.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.501]  Then the new Trends Journal is out.
[00:14:16.062 --> 00:14:18.204]  Gerald Cilente is going to be on for an hour.
[00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:20.686]  We're going to take 30 minutes of calls with him.
[00:14:22.355 --> 00:14:29.601]  And then in the third hour, I want to condense what we did over two hours of the three-hour broadcast yesterday, but I want to discipline myself.
[00:14:29.641 --> 00:14:38.407]  I did a pretty good job, but still not radio graffiti, as some have called it, where you just take each caller, no matter what, they get 45 seconds.
[00:14:39.869 --> 00:14:46.494]  I want to open the phones up and say, are you for vaccines or against vaccines, and have you been damaged by vaccines or have vaccines helped you?
[00:14:47.134 --> 00:14:50.317]  No one called in yesterday out of probably 20-something calls we took.
[00:14:51.718 --> 00:14:53.039]  Who said vaccines had helped them.
[00:14:53.099 --> 00:15:00.304]  It was, I got polio from it, or I got paralyzed from it, or my wife was forced to take it, the Marine's pregnant and she had a miscarriage the next day.
[00:15:01.504 --> 00:15:02.165]  On and on and on.
[00:15:02.225 --> 00:15:03.806]  But we're going to open the phones up again.
[00:15:05.027 --> 00:15:14.313]  Imagine, over 170 AM and FM affiliates, huge internet audience, Roku, Boxee, TV stations in Houston carrying the show.
[00:15:15.233 --> 00:15:16.334]  No one calls in.
[00:15:17.395 --> 00:15:20.297]  Millions of live listeners calls in to defend
[00:15:21.604 --> 00:15:27.766]  I wish that caller would have called in to go, you rednecks need to take your shots, like we're against medical science.
[00:15:29.087 --> 00:15:36.930]  We're against medical tyranny and forced inoculations with a government caught spiking vaccines and a UN caught spiking them.
[00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:44.973]  And it's you pseudo-intellectuals that think anyone from Texas or the South is stupid.
[00:15:46.718 --> 00:15:48.299]  That that aren't real intellectuals.
[00:15:48.339 --> 00:15:49.079]  You just call in.
[00:15:49.099 --> 00:15:49.780]  There are people.
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.322]  It's the hippies and it's the highly educated liberals.
[00:15:54.462 --> 00:15:55.262]  You can look at the numbers.
[00:15:55.282 --> 00:15:57.083]  They had AP articles breaking it down.
[00:15:57.504 --> 00:16:02.906]  It's liberal people with more than two degrees, two or more degrees that are the most unvaccinated.
[00:16:02.926 --> 00:16:03.287]  Look it up.
[00:16:04.187 --> 00:16:05.468]  It is the real liberals.
[00:16:07.756 --> 00:16:11.938]  It's not the pop liberals that are unvaccinated because they're not stupid.
[00:16:12.358 --> 00:16:19.021]  It is the most liberal counties in Northern California have the highest rates of no vaccination because they're not stupid.
[00:16:20.921 --> 00:16:25.723]  Those type of liberals that socially are for equality and things, and I agree with a lot of their views.
[00:16:26.964 --> 00:16:29.205]  I'm a paleo-conservative or a libertarian.
[00:16:29.465 --> 00:16:31.966]  You call me a classical liberal because I love Thomas Jefferson.
[00:16:32.881 --> 00:16:35.202]  I've actually read his writings, read his books, read his letters.
[00:16:35.582 --> 00:16:38.104]  I agree with Thomas Jefferson 100% basically.
[00:16:39.745 --> 00:16:42.706]  So you could call me a liberal, but none of these terms mean anything.
[00:16:42.826 --> 00:16:53.292]  I'm more allied with mainline conservatives because at least they're pro-life, anti-infanticide, anti-eugenics, and on the surface anti-surveillance state.
[00:16:53.732 --> 00:17:00.276]  They tend to be police state oriented in some ways and warmongers, and I'm reaching out to them trying to get them to wake up.
[00:17:01.049 --> 00:17:05.791]  But I'm more allied with what you'd call the left when it comes to not wanting to have a bunch of imperial wars.
[00:17:06.172 --> 00:17:09.893]  The problem is, under the so-called left, we get even bigger wars.
[00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:11.134]  They just don't call them that.
[00:17:11.174 --> 00:17:12.355]  They call them humanitarian.
[00:17:14.436 --> 00:17:22.320]  So in the third hour, we're going to open the phones up on your vaccine stories, your take on vaccines, but just have it ready because we're going to go right to you.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.441]  And I'm going to do it.
[00:17:26.096 --> 00:17:34.802]  This Brian Williams story is coming up as well and it's incredibly important because
[00:17:36.058 --> 00:17:45.426]  It's not just about Brian Williams coming in an hour later or an hour and a half later on a helicopter into a zone where a helicopter had been shot down and claiming he was on that helicopter.
[00:17:45.986 --> 00:17:55.855]  It isn't like he was behind another helicopter and it was the fog of war and he just kind of conflated and exaggerated and said I was in a helicopter that was shot down.
[00:17:57.199 --> 00:17:58.260]  He completely lied.
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.401]  The network backed him.
[00:17:59.681 --> 00:18:02.583]  The entire news crew of six people that were with him backed him.
[00:18:02.603 --> 00:18:05.084]  They had another helicopter full of more crew behind him.
[00:18:05.385 --> 00:18:08.827]  This was a conspiracy to make him some type of war hero.
[00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:22.455]  You know, my cousin's dad who died last year, we were just talking about it before the show, he never bragged about it but we dug through his army chest one time and he, you know, had the bronze star and all that type of stuff.
[00:18:23.215 --> 00:18:27.557]  He was shot down seven times in Vietnam because he delivered special forces to hot zones.
[00:18:28.362 --> 00:18:28.622]  I think
[00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:51.202]  Yet again.
[00:18:51.443 --> 00:18:54.664]  And we have a clip of Hillary Clinton doing the same thing.
[00:18:55.044 --> 00:18:57.686]  Claiming she was in a C-130 over Bosnia that got shot up.
[00:18:57.926 --> 00:18:58.826]  Turned out none of that happened.
[00:19:00.127 --> 00:19:02.848]  These are congenital degenerate liars.
[00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:05.670]  I mean, I've never been in the military.
[00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:06.950]  I've never been shot down.
[00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:07.711]  I've never been shot.
[00:19:09.472 --> 00:19:15.435]  And I would just never imagine that I would then just make up that I had been shot down.
[00:19:15.895 --> 00:19:17.476]  But that shows how much they lie.
[00:19:17.576 --> 00:19:19.717]  It shows how they think they can get away with anything.
[00:19:20.703 --> 00:19:23.106]  It shows how they are preying on the public.
[00:19:23.967 --> 00:19:33.337]  You know, yesterday I called this reporter that was saying, how dare you, you know, to Rand Paul and implying that he's an idiot and all this stuff over, saying we should have the choice not to be vaccinated.
[00:19:33.577 --> 00:19:34.658]  I called her a media whore.
[00:19:35.495 --> 00:19:44.158]  And as soon as I said that, I had the image of MSNBC, CNN, Raw Story, Media Matters saying I called her a physical whore, which I didn't.
[00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:55.482]  Sure enough, Raw Story, Media Matters, MSNBC headline, Alex Jones defends Rand Paul vaccine statements by calling CBS host a tramp and a whore, in quotes.
[00:19:55.922 --> 00:19:58.983]  But then later in the article, they have, it quotes, media whore.
[00:19:59.283 --> 00:20:02.464]  So see, that's being a media whore, what they did, deceiving the public.
[00:20:02.944 --> 00:20:05.491]  I didn't claim she was a streetwalker or a prostitute.
[00:20:05.672 --> 00:20:06.975]  I said she was a media whore.
[00:20:09.502 --> 00:20:13.083]  It's no secret that government and big business buy in bulk and get huge discounts.
[00:20:13.283 --> 00:20:14.544]  Not available to the little guy.

[00:22:03.316 --> 00:22:03.656]  Silver Bullet.
[00:22:08.857 --> 00:22:15.058]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[00:22:15.618 --> 00:22:19.379]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[00:22:19.999 --> 00:22:22.960]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.100]  Not fun!
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:32.442]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[00:22:33.022 --> 00:22:37.783]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[00:22:38.123 --> 00:22:38.943]  My name is Errol.

[00:22:43.404 --> 00:22:50.865]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your Trace Mineral Supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[00:22:51.245 --> 00:22:57.306]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.

[00:23:08.078 --> 00:23:09.779]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[00:23:09.999 --> 00:23:13.322]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[00:23:13.642 --> 00:23:14.622]  A pair of scissors.
[00:23:15.003 --> 00:23:20.486]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[00:23:20.786 --> 00:23:25.449]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.530]  The phone line.
[00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:31.613]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[00:23:31.954 --> 00:23:35.696]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[00:23:35.856 --> 00:23:38.739]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[00:23:39.159 --> 00:23:41.422]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.

[00:24:16.979 --> 00:24:18.780]  But save a few for Lefty, too.
[00:24:19.561 --> 00:24:21.423]  He only did what he had to do.
[00:24:22.223 --> 00:24:24.965]  And now he's grown old.
[00:24:25.045 --> 00:24:30.370]  Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson.
[00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:31.310]  Love this song.
[00:24:34.032 --> 00:24:36.594]  Livin' on the road, my friend.
[00:24:36.614 --> 00:24:37.936]  It's gonna keep you free and clean.
[00:24:38.096 --> 00:24:40.357]  It's gonna keep you free and clean.
[00:24:41.727 --> 00:24:48.451]  And now you wear your skin like iron, and your breath as hard as kerosene.
[00:24:48.652 --> 00:24:50.153]  Weren't your mama's only boy?
[00:24:52.154 --> 00:24:55.216]  But her favorite one was me.
[00:24:56.497 --> 00:24:57.437]  She cried.
[00:24:57.738 --> 00:25:02.541]  She began to cry when you said goodbye.
[00:25:03.101 --> 00:25:06.804]  You sank into your dream.
[00:25:07.244 --> 00:25:10.166]  I'd like to just sit back and listen to music like this all day.
[00:25:11.144 --> 00:25:12.185]  He wore his gun.
[00:25:12.325 --> 00:25:14.907]  For the whole world to feel.
[00:25:15.087 --> 00:25:17.288]  On the deserts down in Mexico.
[00:25:34.837 --> 00:25:37.318]  This show is so overwhelming today.
[00:25:37.338 --> 00:25:38.898]  There's so much I want to get into.
[00:25:38.918 --> 00:25:44.980]  Remember last week, the second grader in Texas was joking around saying, I have the ring of power.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:45.680]  I can disappear.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.461]  You can disappear.
[00:25:46.761 --> 00:25:49.362]  They called that a threat, kicked him out of school, called the police.
[00:25:49.942 --> 00:25:52.522]  Well, now the story's on Infowars.com.
[00:25:52.542 --> 00:25:53.903]  There's video of it from court.
[00:25:54.523 --> 00:25:57.727]  Man arrested on terrorism charges for carrying protein snacks.
[00:25:58.308 --> 00:26:00.111]  Detained and jailed for 23 hours.
[00:26:00.151 --> 00:26:02.013]  Video proves TSA lied in court.
[00:26:02.474 --> 00:26:04.697]  They went ahead and tried to convict him.
[00:26:06.708 --> 00:26:08.629]  of having explosives and threatening them.
[00:26:08.709 --> 00:26:15.051]  Four power bars, the most popular, longest-selling, I mean power bars have been around for decades.
[00:26:15.611 --> 00:26:17.732]  Any moron knows you can buy these at 7-Eleven.
[00:26:18.672 --> 00:26:24.694]  It contains milk, grain, and sugar, but they went ahead and said it was a bomb, and went to court and tried to put him in prison.
[00:26:26.394 --> 00:26:27.495]  That's what's crazy about this.
[00:26:27.555 --> 00:26:31.496]  A few years ago I had the guy on, they were trying to put life in prison for taping the police at his own house.
[00:26:31.876 --> 00:26:33.897]  They were calling it wiretapping in Illinois.
[00:26:34.758 --> 00:26:38.580]  And you just go, you're really gonna try to put him in jail for life?
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.441]  Calling it wiretapping when you knew he was recording you?
[00:26:44.443 --> 00:26:49.745]  It's like these police videos where they clearly beat somebody with a baton and then charge them with assaulting them.
[00:26:49.865 --> 00:26:51.106]  I mean, it's just crazy town.
[00:26:52.546 --> 00:26:53.287]  It's crazy town.
[00:26:55.188 --> 00:26:57.289]  You know, I was mentioning MSNBC.
[00:26:59.261 --> 00:27:00.403]  This is from Politico.
[00:27:00.523 --> 00:27:03.608]  MSC suffers its lowest ratings in a decade.
[00:27:03.628 --> 00:27:04.770]  This came out yesterday.
[00:27:07.355 --> 00:27:08.617]  They have an average of 55,000 viewers.
[00:27:11.823 --> 00:27:14.224]  And the all-important 25- to 54-year-old.
[00:27:15.185 --> 00:27:18.506]  And on average, their shows only have a couple hundred thousand viewers.
[00:27:18.926 --> 00:27:26.390]  Ladies and gentlemen, do you understand that this broadcast rated, and most of our stations don't even subscribe to that, so it's not covered.
[00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:33.333]  The last time they had an ad agency break the numbers down, it was almost 400,000 people every 15 minutes that tune into this.
[00:27:33.513 --> 00:27:34.354]  That was a couple years ago.
[00:27:35.254 --> 00:27:36.415]  And that's just AM and FM.
[00:27:37.782 --> 00:27:39.183]  Millions on YouTube every day.
[00:27:39.583 --> 00:27:42.365]  Millions on the streams and the podcasts and everything else together.
[00:27:43.226 --> 00:27:45.708]  Three million a day tune in throughout three hours.
[00:27:46.208 --> 00:27:48.109]  I mean, these people are a joke!
[00:27:50.951 --> 00:27:54.614]  MSNBC, when they first launched, had like 10 million viewers on their big shows.
[00:27:55.315 --> 00:27:57.996]  And it's not just because the internet and more choices came along.
[00:27:58.036 --> 00:27:59.117]  That was part of their slide.
[00:27:59.497 --> 00:28:02.820]  But what's killing them is their baloney.
[00:28:04.736 --> 00:28:07.438]  Everyone agrees we should all take vaccines and Rand Paul's a kook.
[00:28:07.478 --> 00:28:08.639]  Let's arrest anybody that doesn't.
[00:28:08.759 --> 00:28:10.920]  Well, I come out and say, you're a media whore.
[00:28:12.561 --> 00:28:16.444]  Here's the article right here from the White House-run Media Matters.
[00:28:17.084 --> 00:28:18.305]  And then here's another raw story.
[00:28:19.406 --> 00:28:26.310]  Alex Jones defends listener Rand Paul on vaccines by attacking whore, trash, tramp, filth, scum, CNBC anchor.
[00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:27.871]  Of course, those are all taken out of context.
[00:28:28.611 --> 00:28:33.855]  You actually read later in the article, it says that Alex Jones called her a media whore.
[00:28:35.196 --> 00:28:36.536]  There's another article out of Raw Story.
[00:28:37.337 --> 00:28:43.859]  You can flip to that, and it's got Jones yelling, you arrogant piece of garbage, I'm sick of all you people up here lecturing us.
[00:28:43.879 --> 00:28:49.360]  She's the type of woman that wants Super Bowl ads to say, sorry, you had a boy, all a bunch of pinheaded cult members.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.781]  Jones called Evans a media whore.
[00:28:52.642 --> 00:28:57.364]  And I went on for saying, no, she's a pimp, pimping out her audience with disinformation.
[00:28:57.604 --> 00:28:59.525]  They took it out of context and just say whore.
[00:29:00.145 --> 00:29:03.486]  But in the article covering their butt, they say media whore, close quote.
[00:29:04.007 --> 00:29:08.008]  Big difference saying she'll whore herself out the vaccine makers.
[00:29:08.748 --> 00:29:10.969]  But when they're done, how dare him call a woman a whore?
[00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:14.711]  I didn't call her a physical street walking whore.
[00:29:17.383 --> 00:29:24.691]  By the way, I got a lot more respect for a street-walking whore than a person like this, shelling out folks with deadly vaccines and saying that there's no side effects.
[00:29:25.792 --> 00:29:29.616]  I'll call Megyn Kelly a media whore as well, up there saying there's no side effects.
[00:29:29.676 --> 00:29:30.417]  It's totally safe.
[00:29:30.737 --> 00:29:31.057]  Take it.
[00:29:31.097 --> 00:29:31.858]  We need Big Brother.
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.901]  We're talking about kids getting hurt here.
[00:29:36.583 --> 00:29:37.865]  You are media whores.
[00:29:38.025 --> 00:29:38.826]  You are pimps.
[00:29:41.038 --> 00:29:43.279]  Vaccine companies pimping out your poor audiences.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.700]  I'll say it again and again and again.
[00:29:44.901 --> 00:29:45.401]  Media whore.
[00:29:45.541 --> 00:29:46.021]  Media whore.
[00:29:46.161 --> 00:29:46.622]  Media whore.
[00:29:46.962 --> 00:29:48.283]  And I call men media whores.
[00:29:49.203 --> 00:29:50.304]  He calls them prostitutes.
[00:29:50.564 --> 00:29:51.125]  Men and women.
[00:29:51.165 --> 00:29:52.265]  We've got Gerald Slundey coming up.
[00:29:53.386 --> 00:29:54.086]  Prostitutes.
[00:29:54.147 --> 00:29:55.507]  You are a prostitute.
[00:29:55.888 --> 00:29:56.688]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:56.788 --> 00:29:57.289]  Stay with us.
[00:29:57.589 --> 00:29:58.910]  Jam-packed transmission coming up.
[00:29:58.930 --> 00:29:59.730]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.312]  The empire is on the run.
[00:30:02.672 --> 00:30:05.374]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.481]  Year after year, we watched the threats steadily increase.
[00:30:12.741 --> 00:30:18.102]  And now, this winter has been the worst on record when it comes to our immune systems and health.
[00:30:18.362 --> 00:30:27.425]  For more than two years, InfoWarsLife.com has been watching this crisis intensify, and Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Complex was our answer.

[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.982]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:31:13.122 --> 00:31:17.103]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:31:17.403 --> 00:31:18.864]  Can you put two and two together?

[00:31:39.079 --> 00:31:42.301]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[00:33:19.773 --> 00:33:23.954]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:24.654 --> 00:33:26.155]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.955 --> 00:33:29.055]  My love is in lead with the hierarchy.
[00:33:29.875 --> 00:33:35.557]  There is something about driving to meet your lover.
[00:33:36.377 --> 00:33:37.817]  Especially over long distances.
[00:33:38.797 --> 00:33:43.058]  It just builds the anticipation and makes you think about them.
[00:33:43.559 --> 00:33:44.179]  That journey.
[00:33:44.479 --> 00:33:45.859]  The journey is the destination.
[00:33:45.879 --> 00:33:47.219]  Let's play a little bit of this.
[00:33:47.319 --> 00:33:47.940]  Robert Plant.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.120]  Bringing us in.
[00:33:50.828 --> 00:33:55.671]  My love is in lead with the highway.
[00:33:55.771 --> 00:33:57.772]  Meg Loggs the show.
[00:33:58.132 --> 00:34:03.135]  My love is in lead with the freeway.
[00:34:03.355 --> 00:34:08.938]  It's the fashionable ride as the cities fly by.
[00:34:09.218 --> 00:34:17.563]  And the taillights dissolve in the coming of night.
[00:34:17.803 --> 00:34:18.924]  And the questions
[00:34:21.587 --> 00:34:25.049]  My love is in league.
[00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:29.072]  My love is in league with human freedom.
[00:34:29.132 --> 00:34:30.693]  Human destiny.
[00:34:31.574 --> 00:34:32.255]  Justice.
[00:34:32.775 --> 00:34:33.135]  Strength.
[00:34:33.435 --> 00:34:33.676]  Honor.
[00:34:34.396 --> 00:34:37.118]  All the things that are under attack.
[00:34:38.859 --> 00:34:40.080]  For me, it's not even a choice.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.681]  And I'm not claiming I'm the best guy around.
[00:34:41.721 --> 00:34:43.743]  It's just... I don't want to screw people over.
[00:34:43.843 --> 00:34:47.425]  I want to... give people a fair shake, and I want a fair shake.
[00:34:47.465 --> 00:34:48.246]  But I'll tell you one thing.
[00:34:48.526 --> 00:34:49.447]  You want to screw me over?
[00:34:50.677 --> 00:34:52.039]  You want to try to run my life?
[00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:53.722]  I'm going to fight you and fight you hard.
[00:34:54.022 --> 00:34:58.129]  And it's that fighting spirit that's going to take back this world and you've got it out there.
[00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:01.114]  Briefly, before I get back into the news and the special report.
[00:35:04.639 --> 00:35:10.484]  This ad that I just cut impromptu yesterday that Rob Jacobson put together, I think is a really good ad because it says it all.
[00:35:11.064 --> 00:35:20.692]  And I was thinking just last week, why just have Valentine's Day be about roses and, you know, going out to eat and standing in line and trying to get a reservation?
[00:35:21.252 --> 00:35:22.853]  Why not make it about human empowerment?
[00:35:22.873 --> 00:35:27.875]  It's not just about men and women loving each other, it's about humanity loving ourselves, building something better.
[00:35:28.416 --> 00:35:48.906]  So every February, and I intend to make videos about this and stuff, not just a pitch for super male or super female vitality, to really make February, maybe it'll get picked up on at least here to our millions of listeners, Human Empowerment Month and a celebration of George Washington Carver and Beethoven and Leonardo da Vinci and
[00:35:50.453 --> 00:35:54.796]  Moses and just all the other amazing type people that have come along.
[00:35:54.836 --> 00:35:55.797]  George Washington.
[00:35:58.418 --> 00:36:02.221]  So, instead of Black History Month or White History Month, how about Human History Month?
[00:36:02.601 --> 00:36:03.642]  Human Empowerment Month?
[00:36:04.202 --> 00:36:15.270]  And it's a great way to start is by getting juiced up on high quality herbs and things that'll basically block out and supercharge and stop the globalist onslaught to a great extent.
[00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:17.271]  I am empowered by super male vitality.
[00:36:17.631 --> 00:36:19.572]  I take it now, religiously, a couple times a day.
[00:36:20.473 --> 00:36:23.276]  Take it easy when you first start taking it because it's really hardcore.
[00:36:23.997 --> 00:36:25.498]  Just consult your physicians.
[00:36:25.999 --> 00:36:27.820]  It's 20% off in the month of February.
[00:36:28.441 --> 00:36:29.502]  So is the Super Female.
[00:36:29.662 --> 00:36:30.843]  Super Female is the same formula.
[00:36:30.864 --> 00:36:37.110]  It's just got a few extra herbs in it that turbocharge women and aren't so good for men, I guess you could say.
[00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:39.512]  But some men like to take the Super Female.
[00:36:40.453 --> 00:36:40.813]  It's got
[00:36:42.978 --> 00:36:46.123]  It's got the scientific name of one of the herbs, but it has a very crass name, one of them.
[00:36:46.363 --> 00:36:50.009]  It has to do with goats, but the point is, this is not a game, it's the real deal.
[00:36:50.289 --> 00:36:53.894]  It's the ultimate Valentine's present, so let's go ahead and play this new ad.
[00:36:54.997 --> 00:36:58.019]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[00:36:58.359 --> 00:37:01.641]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[00:37:01.882 --> 00:37:07.866]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[00:37:07.966 --> 00:37:09.126]  I'm all about human potential.
[00:37:09.347 --> 00:37:11.508]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[00:37:11.568 --> 00:37:13.069]  The establishment is the opposite.
[00:37:13.149 --> 00:37:17.672]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[00:37:17.932 --> 00:37:22.295]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[00:37:22.535 --> 00:37:24.817]  How we can come together and win the human race.
[00:37:25.157 --> 00:37:33.019]  And to celebrate the kickoff of Human Empowerment Month, we're slashing prices on InfoWarsLife.com products like Super Male and Super Female Vitality.

[00:38:08.299 --> 00:38:12.043]  A great gift to give is the Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0, totally organic.
[00:38:12.543 --> 00:38:15.645]  So many people have mineral and trace element deficiencies.
[00:38:16.126 --> 00:38:17.827]  The Pollen Burst is excellent.
[00:38:18.167 --> 00:38:21.650]  Best energy drink out there in my view, and it's got the bee pollen and other great stuff in it.
[00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:23.111]  Talk about supercharged.
[00:38:23.191 --> 00:38:25.172]  InfoWarsHealth.com.
[00:38:25.452 --> 00:38:27.514]  And the phone number is also on that site.
[00:38:27.914 --> 00:38:30.956]  InfoWarsHealth.com, InfoWarsTeam.com, or 888-789-9277.
[00:38:30.976 --> 00:38:31.036]  888-789-9277.

[00:38:39.926 --> 00:38:42.574]  But seriously, try the super male or super female vitality.
[00:38:42.635 --> 00:38:43.859]  You're not going to be disappointed.
[00:38:43.979 --> 00:38:44.380]  No one.
[00:38:44.701 --> 00:38:45.885]  We've had zero complaints.
[00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.151]  Other than, like, once a broken bottle or something wanting it replaced.
[00:38:49.671 --> 00:38:52.053]  I mean, it's oxy powder.
[00:38:52.153 --> 00:38:52.753]  No complaints.
[00:38:53.373 --> 00:38:53.813]  Unbelievable.
[00:38:54.374 --> 00:38:55.814]  What it's done for my intestinal tract.
[00:38:55.834 --> 00:38:56.555]  You've heard the rave reviews.
[00:38:56.875 --> 00:38:58.055]  Just go buy the products.
[00:38:58.315 --> 00:38:59.316]  Support the broadcast.
[00:38:59.356 --> 00:39:00.176]  It'll support you.
[00:39:00.477 --> 00:39:01.137]  It's a win-win.
[00:39:01.157 --> 00:39:03.178]  We appreciate and salute you for your support.
[00:39:03.198 --> 00:39:11.622]  Now, I'm going to skip this network break coming up because I'm going to go to this Bill Ayers piece and then I'm going to come back and get to Brian Williams ahead of Gerald Cilente joining us.
[00:39:13.004 --> 00:39:25.050]  You need to understand, just like the media put out the headline that I called this news anchor a whore, knowing women would think I was calling her a physical whore, I called her a media whore, and then I defined that she was sold out to the company.
[00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:27.371]  You call anybody that sells out to corruption a whore.
[00:39:28.452 --> 00:39:30.232]  Oh, that guy's a whore, he'll do anything for money.
[00:39:30.793 --> 00:39:33.194]  And I said she's a media whore pimping out her audience.
[00:39:33.954 --> 00:39:34.915]  So they took it out of context.
[00:39:35.956 --> 00:39:36.296]  Why not?
[00:39:36.356 --> 00:39:38.698]  Why didn't she just claim maybe she's a helicopter commander?
[00:39:39.259 --> 00:39:40.300]  Or maybe she's an astronaut.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.761]  You know, like Brian Williams.
[00:39:41.801 --> 00:39:42.541]  It's the same group.
[00:39:42.982 --> 00:39:43.522]  NBC.
[00:39:45.904 --> 00:39:50.268]  Let's go ahead and go to this piece on another person that I think's a liar.
[00:39:50.288 --> 00:39:51.349]  I think that's fair to say.
[00:39:51.369 --> 00:39:56.053]  I mean, Bill Aires said the red star on a black background on his website has nothing to do with communism.
[00:39:56.943 --> 00:39:59.366]  I mean, he's one of the most famous living commies.
[00:40:00.307 --> 00:40:04.191]  Of course, I mean, it's ridiculous how they insult us.
[00:40:04.832 --> 00:40:07.855]  I had Rothschild on, the head of the Rothschild dynasty.
[00:40:07.875 --> 00:40:09.076]  I got him on because he had a book out.
[00:40:12.352 --> 00:40:14.373]  He started trying to get off once he figured out who I was.
[00:40:14.413 --> 00:40:17.615]  He thought I was Alex Jones of the New York Times and the Shorenstein Center.
[00:40:18.235 --> 00:40:19.055]  That's happened a bunch.
[00:40:19.676 --> 00:40:21.156]  And once I got him on, he tried to get off.
[00:40:21.316 --> 00:40:24.758]  And I go, why are the ice caps on Mars melting if ours are melting?
[00:40:24.778 --> 00:40:26.899]  And he goes, because it's closer to the sun than the Earth.
[00:40:27.319 --> 00:40:27.960]  No, it's not.
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.921]  But he thinks my audience is dumb.
[00:40:30.181 --> 00:40:32.222]  It's the fourth planet out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:33.282 --> 00:40:35.723]  Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars.
[00:40:36.324 --> 00:40:37.264]  Then the gas giants.
[00:40:37.564 --> 00:40:38.425]  Then the Kuiper Belt.
[00:40:39.451 --> 00:40:41.052]  I mean, look, it doesn't work.
[00:40:41.132 --> 00:40:42.974]  We know 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:40:43.234 --> 00:40:45.135]  We know raising the debt limit raises the debt limit.
[00:40:45.456 --> 00:40:46.957]  We know everything's not awesome.
[00:40:47.297 --> 00:40:49.259]  Oh, America and freedom's awesome.
[00:40:49.539 --> 00:40:51.280]  You people trying to screw it over aren't.
[00:40:52.161 --> 00:40:53.742]  Let's go to this Bill Ayers report.
[00:40:58.206 --> 00:40:59.346]  Infowars.com.
[00:40:59.366 --> 00:41:03.930]  We're posting it right now on Infowars.com as well.
[00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:06.532]  Bill Ayers.
[00:41:06.712 --> 00:41:07.573]  Is he a terrorist?
[00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:09.610]  A communist, question mark?
[00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:11.131]  A liar?
[00:41:11.151 --> 00:41:18.752]  A bomb exploded early this morning in the Pentagon and left-wing terrorists telephoned newspapers to say they were responsible.
[00:41:18.772 --> 00:41:24.613]  We felt pretty grim and pretty determined at the same time that we were going to see this thing through.
[00:41:25.074 --> 00:41:36.276]  At midday, the Associated Press got a phone call from a man saying he was with the Weather Underground and that bombs would explode at the Departments of Interior and Agriculture and the Smithsonian before the day was out.
[00:41:36.736 --> 00:41:41.237]  The sense was that we had to do whatever we had to do in order to stop the war.
[00:41:41.737 --> 00:41:49.199]  People calling themselves members of the Wither Underground last night planted bombs in federal office buildings in Washington and Oakland, California.
[00:41:49.379 --> 00:41:52.520]  We figured out how to use guns and how to use bombs.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.941]  I mean, we taught ourselves, we trained ourselves how to do it.
[00:41:56.441 --> 00:42:00.002]  Some people felt, literally, that the bigger the mess we could make, the better.
[00:42:00.382 --> 00:42:07.025]  Credit for the Capitol bombing was claimed in a letter received by the Associated Press today signed by the Weather Underground.
[00:42:07.305 --> 00:42:11.947]  The Underground Weatherman Organization claimed responsibility for the San Francisco and Sacramento bombings.
[00:42:12.047 --> 00:42:18.390]  The explosion destroyed one of the Pentagon's 140 women's restrooms and blasted out a wall on the fourth floor.
[00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:21.331]  And I've been quoted again and again as saying, I don't regret it.
[00:42:21.711 --> 00:42:24.732]  And frankly, and saying, I don't think we did enough.
[00:42:24.832 --> 00:42:25.933]  And I don't think we did enough.
[00:42:28.948 --> 00:42:31.912]  Bill Ayers, thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[00:42:31.932 --> 00:42:33.834]  Again, billayers.org.
[00:42:33.854 --> 00:42:36.117]  I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:42:36.137 --> 00:42:38.700]  I've never heard of that, but that's fascinating.
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:42.665]  You know, I'm so bewildered about what you're talking about.
[00:42:42.685 --> 00:42:43.826]  I didn't know he was doing that.
[00:42:44.066 --> 00:42:44.948]  I had no idea.
[00:42:48.363 --> 00:42:53.948]  You've got these great theories, but I don't know... We're not talking the same language.
[00:42:54.208 --> 00:42:55.749]  But this is news to me.
[00:42:55.769 --> 00:42:57.410]  I have no idea what you're referring to.
[00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.652]  Again, I know nothing about George Soros.
[00:42:59.872 --> 00:43:01.493]  I'm not sure what that means, Alex.
[00:43:01.513 --> 00:43:02.634]  I don't know who you're referring to.
[00:43:02.654 --> 00:43:03.935]  I say nothing!
[00:43:04.236 --> 00:43:05.356]  I was not here!
[00:43:05.597 --> 00:43:07.178]  I did not even get up!
[00:43:08.078 --> 00:43:09.759]  I have no idea what you're referring to.
[00:43:10.259 --> 00:43:12.359]  I don't know what, again, what are you referring to?
[00:43:12.519 --> 00:43:13.240]  Never happened.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.560]  I don't know what you're referring to.
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:16.020]  Who are you talking about?
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.921]  And I don't even know what that means.
[00:43:18.561 --> 00:43:22.402]  I hear your paranoia eking through, but I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:43:23.022 --> 00:43:24.543]  Because you know what I'm going to do with all this.
[00:43:24.583 --> 00:43:30.164]  We're going to take this live interview and then take clips of what you're saying and then show them throughout.
[00:43:30.204 --> 00:43:30.944]  That's the whole point.
[00:43:31.845 --> 00:43:33.085]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:43:33.105 --> 00:43:35.486]  I say nothing.
[00:43:36.046 --> 00:43:37.086]  Well, where do you want to start?
[00:43:38.399 --> 00:43:44.361]  They estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[00:43:45.021 --> 00:43:48.963]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill 25 million people.
[00:43:49.963 --> 00:43:55.825]  Then let me just start with communism itself, because most communists say they're socialists.
[00:43:56.943 --> 00:44:02.127]  But then when you get around them in person, they start telling you about violent overthrows and the plan to take over.
[00:44:03.048 --> 00:44:10.294]  Do you endorse the type of communism we saw in Russia, in China, or how would you really describe yourself?
[00:44:11.034 --> 00:44:12.436]  Well, the answer to your question is no.
[00:44:13.677 --> 00:44:16.859]  But, you know, I've been a person my whole life as an educator.
[00:44:16.879 --> 00:44:20.282]  I've opposed the notion of labeling people in a simple-minded way.
[00:44:20.822 --> 00:44:22.564]  But yes, I am opposed to capitalism.
[00:44:24.147 --> 00:44:27.633]  In recognizing a communist, physical appearance counts for nothing.
[00:44:28.776 --> 00:44:33.057]  If he openly declares himself to be a communist, we take his word for it.
[00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:37.199]  I think that we should downsize the Pentagon by about 90%.
[00:44:38.539 --> 00:44:40.280]  I think we should stop the war industry.
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:45.241]  I think we should stop arming the dictators and petty fascists all over the world.
[00:44:45.261 --> 00:44:51.123]  I think we should become a nation among nations, not the Uber nation, not the controller of everything.
[00:44:51.363 --> 00:44:54.164]  So in that sense, Alex, we've already found a point of unity.
[00:44:55.134 --> 00:44:58.635]  Very good tactics about getting a point of unity.
[00:44:58.935 --> 00:45:06.136]  Why, if you were a Green Beret in a village with the village elders having a debate, you'd find that first point of unity, common ground.
[00:45:06.376 --> 00:45:08.037]  In a month, you'd have them fighting for you.
[00:45:08.457 --> 00:45:09.497]  And I understand that.
[00:45:09.717 --> 00:45:10.937]  But you're not a Green Beret.
[00:45:11.377 --> 00:45:12.778]  You fight for a different army.
[00:45:12.798 --> 00:45:19.919]  This is a guy who lives in my neighborhood, who's a professor of English in Chicago, who
[00:45:21.813 --> 00:45:28.282]  I know, and who I have not received some official endorsement from.
[00:45:28.322 --> 00:45:31.566]  He's not somebody who I exchange ideas from on a regular basis.
[00:45:32.146 --> 00:45:35.331]  What is your view of Barack Obama then?
[00:45:36.405 --> 00:45:39.928]  I've always had the same view of Barack Obama, as long as I've known him.
[00:45:39.988 --> 00:45:41.489]  I've known him for a long, long time.
[00:45:41.509 --> 00:45:55.278]  Barack Obama, as he said of himself in the 2008 campaign, and as he's defined himself all through his political life, he says of himself, I'm a moderate, middle-of-the-road, pragmatic, compromising politician.
[00:45:55.678 --> 00:45:57.840]  That's who he said he is, that's who he is.
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:00.602]  The right wing looked at him and said, no, he's not that.
[00:46:00.962 --> 00:46:05.664]  What he is instead is a secret Muslim who pals around with terrorists and has socialist ideas.
[00:46:06.024 --> 00:46:09.265]  I have yet to see a socialist idea come out of Barack Obama.
[00:46:09.385 --> 00:46:09.966]  Are you kidding?
[00:46:09.986 --> 00:46:13.427]  You're talking about free community college and open borders?
[00:46:13.707 --> 00:46:20.790]  Put simply, what I'd like to do is to see the first two years of community college free for everybody who's willing to work for it.
[00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:30.314]  Last week, I sent a letter to Congress asking them to increase penalties on smugglers and to give us flexibility to move migrants through the system faster.
[00:46:30.834 --> 00:46:38.099]  What do you think about Obama wanting a domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military and having youth brigades chanting his name?
[00:46:40.881 --> 00:46:42.022]  I didn't know he was doing that.
[00:46:42.503 --> 00:46:49.488]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:46:50.869 --> 00:46:51.789]  I am change.
[00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:54.731]  And this is what I wear.
[00:47:01.101 --> 00:47:05.103]  I, you know, I knew Barack Obama about as well as thousands and thousands of other people.
[00:47:05.143 --> 00:47:07.444]  It's not that we, we weren't intimate friends.
[00:47:07.484 --> 00:47:09.745]  We never shared a milkshake with two straws.
[00:47:09.825 --> 00:47:10.065]  Never.
[00:47:10.085 --> 00:47:13.887]  Alright, well, nobody ever said you did that.
[00:47:14.227 --> 00:47:15.908]  You'd have to be in Cuddlin' to be doing that.
[00:47:15.968 --> 00:47:17.088]  We were close friends.
[00:47:17.168 --> 00:47:17.628]  I was not intimate.
[00:47:17.648 --> 00:47:19.009]  You never dated Barack Obama?
[00:47:19.679 --> 00:47:20.919]  I never dated him, right.
[00:47:21.059 --> 00:47:21.339]  Okay.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:36.083]  Toward the end of 1968, I had really decided that I was committed to being a part of what I thought was going to be a really serious and ongoing rebellion, upheaval, that had the potential of not just ending the war, but of really overthrowing the capitalist system.
[00:47:36.103 --> 00:47:38.184]  Who funds you?
[00:47:38.204 --> 00:47:41.624]  Because I've read you're connected to the Ford Foundation, Carnegie, and others.
[00:47:41.884 --> 00:47:43.665]  Have you ever gotten any funding from those guys?
[00:47:44.244 --> 00:47:46.126]  Never, and I don't even know what that means.
[00:47:46.166 --> 00:47:46.927]  Who funds me?
[00:47:47.027 --> 00:47:48.329]  I'm a retired professor.
[00:47:48.409 --> 00:47:51.513]  I live modestly like other retired professors.
[00:47:51.553 --> 00:47:52.394]  I'm not sure what you mean.
[00:47:52.414 --> 00:48:00.503]  You're saying there's not a CIA program back to the 50s to fund liberation theology that I know you're fully aware of at university campuses?
[00:48:01.504 --> 00:48:06.126]  I hear your paranoia eking through, but I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:48:06.186 --> 00:48:09.188]  Liberation theology has nothing to do with campuses.
[00:48:09.268 --> 00:48:11.129]  It's a movement within the Catholic Church.
[00:48:11.529 --> 00:48:13.410]  Is it a left-wing movement in the Catholic Church?
[00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:14.030]  Yes, it is.
[00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:15.711]  Does it come out of Brazil?
[00:48:15.771 --> 00:48:16.271]  It does.
[00:48:16.692 --> 00:48:21.074]  Does Pope Francis to some extent, is he to some extent influenced by that?
[00:48:21.134 --> 00:48:22.054]  Apparently he is.
[00:48:22.174 --> 00:48:22.574]  Oh boy.
[00:48:22.895 --> 00:48:23.935]  That has to do with me.
[00:48:23.955 --> 00:48:26.636]  I see nothing.
[00:48:27.017 --> 00:48:29.038]  Are you excited about Pope Francis and his
[00:48:30.137 --> 00:48:31.057]  Liberation theology?
[00:48:31.698 --> 00:48:33.798]  It's hard for me to get excited about a Pope.
[00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:40.020]  I know that for those of you who are Catholic, he's infallible, so I guess the Catholics must be excited about him.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:48.823]  I think that when he says, who am I to judge, and when he opens himself to the possibility of greater freedom for women, I think those are good things.
[00:48:49.683 --> 00:48:51.844]  And of course, carbon taxes for George Soros, though.
[00:48:52.934 --> 00:48:54.475]  I'm not sure what that means, Alex.
[00:48:54.555 --> 00:48:59.479]  I mean, I know you've got a big paranoid background that's somewhere bubbling up, but I don't understand.
[00:48:59.499 --> 00:49:00.920]  I thought you don't know who I am.
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:01.680]  Hold on a minute.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.361]  A big paranoid background.
[00:49:03.461 --> 00:49:06.864]  Mao killed 84 million people, according to the Chinese government.
[00:49:07.224 --> 00:49:08.965]  The CIA says 60 million.
[00:49:09.325 --> 00:49:11.827]  Are you saying that I shouldn't be worried about communism?
[00:49:12.587 --> 00:49:13.688]  I didn't say that at all.
[00:49:13.768 --> 00:49:15.369]  You said something about George Soros.
[00:49:15.409 --> 00:49:17.190]  I don't know anything about George Soros.
[00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:18.992]  All right, let me ask you this.
[00:49:19.152 --> 00:49:20.713]  I don't know what you're drawing on.
[00:49:20.733 --> 00:49:22.254]  You know nothing about George Soros?
[00:49:23.154 --> 00:49:24.389]  And we have a big problem.
[00:49:25.123 --> 00:49:33.530]  Global warming requires big investment, and that could be the motor of the world economy.
[00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:40.135]  You've got these great theories, but I don't know, we're not talking the same language.
[00:49:40.255 --> 00:49:41.256]  I know nothing!
[00:49:41.336 --> 00:49:42.557]  I know nothing!
[00:49:42.737 --> 00:49:43.678]  Well, exactly!
[00:49:43.998 --> 00:49:51.544]  You're speaking academia speech, where you're this nice, mild-mannered guy, and you're there with your significant other, Bernadine Dorn.
[00:49:51.805 --> 00:49:54.307]  I guess you guys were never involved in any bombings or anything, right?
[00:49:54.847 --> 00:49:55.667]  No, that's not true.
[00:49:55.727 --> 00:50:02.149]  We were involved in trying to stop the murder of 6,000 people a week by our government that dragged on for 10 years.
[00:50:02.169 --> 00:50:05.750]  I was involved in non-violent sit-ins.
[00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:08.951]  I was involved in all kinds of tactics that were legal.
[00:50:09.311 --> 00:50:15.493]  And eventually we did turn to what I would call extreme vandalism.
[00:50:15.573 --> 00:50:19.674]  We destroyed property to raise a screaming opposition.
[00:50:20.214 --> 00:50:21.955]  To the murder of 6,000 people.
[00:50:22.216 --> 00:50:24.898]  You didn't bomb police officers or blind police officers?
[00:50:25.518 --> 00:50:26.038]  Not at all.
[00:50:26.299 --> 00:50:27.459]  Nothing like that ever happened.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.762]  I know it's part of the narrative of the right, but it's just not true.
[00:50:30.842 --> 00:50:31.162]  Really?
[00:50:31.282 --> 00:50:33.924]  So Weatherman bombs never wounded police?
[00:50:34.825 --> 00:50:35.265]  I'm sorry?
[00:50:35.685 --> 00:50:37.547]  Weatherman bombs never wounded police?
[00:50:38.367 --> 00:50:38.608]  Never.
[00:50:39.388 --> 00:50:40.889]  Because you know what I'm going to do with all this.
[00:50:40.929 --> 00:50:46.533]  We're going to take this live interview and then take clips of what you're saying and then show them throughout.
[00:50:46.573 --> 00:50:47.214]  That's the whole point.
[00:50:48.198 --> 00:50:49.439]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:50:49.799 --> 00:50:57.061]  The FBI said the Weather Underground Organization, which took credit for the bombing, is the same radical group which was responsible for the bombing of the U.S.
[00:50:57.101 --> 00:50:59.642]  Capitol in 1971 and the Pentagon in 1972.
[00:50:59.862 --> 00:51:07.365]  That we'll fight the internal army, which is the police force, yes, more physical contact if that's necessary.
[00:51:08.205 --> 00:51:10.686]  Whatever it takes, we'll do, by any means possible.
[00:51:11.706 --> 00:51:16.810]  There's no way to be committed to non-violence in the middle of the most violent society that history has ever created.
[00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:19.052]  I'm not committed to non-violence in any way.
[00:51:32.061 --> 00:51:33.362]  You say you didn't like Mao.
[00:51:33.802 --> 00:51:41.827]  Was Larry Grafwald wrong that you guys followed a Maoist cultural revolution style system at the Weatherman?
[00:51:42.543 --> 00:51:44.084]  Yeah, he was wrong and he was lying.
[00:51:44.464 --> 00:51:49.987]  But the red star and the black background is also the sign for Heineken beer and Macy's.
[00:51:50.447 --> 00:51:52.668]  So be careful what you worry about.
[00:51:52.708 --> 00:51:53.989]  Oh, come on, man!
[00:51:54.009 --> 00:51:55.370]  You're a famous commie!
[00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:57.431]  Just admit it, you love linen!
[00:51:57.871 --> 00:52:01.293]  There are other communists who don't show their real faces.
[00:52:02.472 --> 00:52:04.713]  We'll work more silently.
[00:52:05.274 --> 00:52:06.715]  First of all, I'm not famous.
[00:52:06.755 --> 00:52:10.937]  Secondly, I don't know what you meant when you said Bill Air's supporters call in.
[00:52:11.097 --> 00:52:13.619]  We haven't had one substantive exchange, you and me.
[00:52:14.019 --> 00:52:16.781]  So I don't know what one would think to be a supporter.
[00:52:17.101 --> 00:52:20.283]  You mean if somebody has read one of my books and has something to say about it?
[00:52:20.583 --> 00:52:22.304]  We haven't talked about anything substantive.
[00:52:22.364 --> 00:52:27.647]  Okay, well you're setting and defining things, like MSNBC saying parents, your kids don't belong to you.
[00:52:27.987 --> 00:52:28.988]  Let me ask you this question.
[00:52:29.188 --> 00:52:30.169]  Do you support abortion?
[00:52:30.689 --> 00:52:32.291]  Wait, when did I say that?
[00:52:33.092 --> 00:52:35.295]  When did I say parents don't belong to their kids?
[00:52:35.315 --> 00:52:36.416]  I said MSNBC said that.
[00:52:37.398 --> 00:52:38.279]  No they did not.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.141]  What are you talking about?
[00:52:40.161 --> 00:52:45.428]  They said we need to break through this view that kids belong to their parents and that they actually belong to the wider community.
[00:52:47.314 --> 00:52:49.995]  You know, I'm so bewildered about what you're talking about.
[00:52:50.055 --> 00:52:57.941]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:52:58.201 --> 00:53:00.563]  Here's where I stand, Professor Ayers.
[00:53:00.923 --> 00:53:04.666]  I don't know if you've read None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen.
[00:53:05.226 --> 00:53:06.967]  I read that book back when I was like 14 years old.
[00:53:08.348 --> 00:53:25.782]  Since then, pretty much all of it has been proven to be accurate, from my perspective, where ultra-rich crony capitalists fund socialist and communist movements, but also fascist movements, because they like to deal with command and control systems with domesticated populations.
[00:53:25.842 --> 00:53:32.088]  And I think that history has shown that collectivism delivers hell on earth and forced work camps.
[00:53:32.788 --> 00:53:36.091]  Now, that's why I disagree with you fundamentally.
[00:53:37.452 --> 00:53:41.916]  And I guess you believe that we have a real form of capitalism and you disagree with that.
[00:53:42.257 --> 00:53:44.919]  I don't believe we have capitalism.
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:52.686]  I believe we have fascism sitting on top of a socialist management system and that the left-right paradigm that's taught is a fraud.
[00:53:52.726 --> 00:53:53.187]  What do you say?
[00:53:54.318 --> 00:53:55.780]  I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.342]  I've never heard of that, but that's fascinating.
[00:53:58.863 --> 00:54:00.945]  I don't know what, again, what are you referring to?
[00:54:01.105 --> 00:54:01.826]  Never have been.
[00:54:01.886 --> 00:54:03.147]  I don't know what you're referring to.
[00:54:03.468 --> 00:54:04.609]  Who are you talking about?
[00:54:04.629 --> 00:54:06.531]  And I don't even know what that means.
[00:54:07.973 --> 00:54:08.513]  Oh, boy.
[00:54:08.974 --> 00:54:12.698]  Well, that's the hardcore commie trying to charm us.
[00:54:12.758 --> 00:54:13.799]  And, oh, I don't know this.
[00:54:13.899 --> 00:54:14.580]  Oh, I don't know that.
[00:54:16.075 --> 00:54:23.740]  And for radio listeners, we show the cops he bombed, that he blinded and hurt, or the weathermen quote did, that he led.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:30.865]  And we show the documentation, the big government foundations funding him directly with mainstream news articles.
[00:54:30.925 --> 00:54:41.192]  So, that's really a TV piece, so I'm just adding some of that for the radio listeners to understand that the guy is an absolutely deceptive creature, as if you need me to tell you that.
[00:54:41.232 --> 00:54:45.475]  But Brian Williams said that he was shot down in a helicopter by an RPG.
[00:54:46.515 --> 00:54:51.318]  Turns out it was an hour or more till they flew into an area where a helicopter had been shot down.
[00:54:51.638 --> 00:54:52.999]  The military started going public.
[00:54:53.539 --> 00:55:00.503]  And I got a bunch of these clips of him at baseball games, at Rangers games, first saying it, of course, on Letterman.
[00:55:01.043 --> 00:55:02.424]  And now he's recanted.
[00:55:03.004 --> 00:55:06.186]  Let's go back and play this liar on Letterman.
[00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:08.851]  We were north of the invasion.
[00:55:09.512 --> 00:55:11.934]  We were the northernmost Americans in Iraq.
[00:55:11.974 --> 00:55:17.578]  We were going to drop some bridge portions across the Euphrates so the 3rd Infantry could cross on them.
[00:55:18.279 --> 00:55:22.642]  Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire, including the one I was in.
[00:55:22.763 --> 00:55:23.323]  No kidding!
[00:55:23.563 --> 00:55:25.024]  RPG and AK-47.
[00:55:25.565 --> 00:55:26.946]  What altitude were you hit at?
[00:55:27.006 --> 00:55:33.331]  We were only at 100 feet doing 100 forward knots because we had these massive pieces of bridge beneath us on slings.
[00:55:33.471 --> 00:55:35.833]  What happens the minute everybody realizes you've been hit?
[00:55:36.113 --> 00:55:39.194]  Uh, we figure out how to land safely, and we did.
[00:55:39.394 --> 00:55:44.355]  We landed very quickly and hard, and we put down, and we were stuck.
[00:55:44.615 --> 00:55:50.237]  Four birds in the middle of the desert, and we were north out ahead of the other Americans.
[00:55:50.257 --> 00:55:54.838]  He goes on embellishing the lie, I mean, this is a book he's trying to write here, of baloney.
[00:55:55.717 --> 00:56:06.910]  Now let's go to him being forced to recant, then we'll go to the Hillary clip, a flashback a few years ago to her saying she was basically in a C-130 that got shot down, that was total bull as well, from a pack of liars.
[00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:08.392]  Let's go to him recanting.
[00:56:09.412 --> 00:56:24.737]  On this broadcast last week, in an effort to honor and thank a veteran who protected me and so many others after a ground fire incident in the desert during the Iraq War invasion, I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago.
[00:56:25.258 --> 00:56:31.580]  It did not take long to hear from some brave men and women in the air crews who were also in that desert.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.180]  I want to apologize.
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:37.282]  I said I was traveling in an aircraft that was hit by RPG fire.
[00:56:37.782 --> 00:56:40.605]  I was instead in a following aircraft.
[00:56:41.025 --> 00:56:48.571]  We all landed after the ground fire incident and spent two harrowing nights in a sandstorm in the Iraq desert.
[00:56:49.052 --> 00:56:56.458]  This was a bungled attempt by me to thank one special veteran and by extension our brave military men and women.
[00:56:56.478 --> 00:56:58.159]  See, our brave military men and women.
[00:56:58.239 --> 00:56:59.140]  I'm thanking a veteran.
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:56:59.901]  I'm not bad.
[00:57:00.481 --> 00:57:02.722]  Doesn't matter I showed up an hour, an hour and a half later.
[00:57:02.742 --> 00:57:08.686]  It doesn't matter I totally lied in dozens of interviews and at Rangers games and on TV with all this stuff.
[00:57:08.926 --> 00:57:11.768]  You're back lying again to cover up the last lie.
[00:57:13.012 --> 00:57:15.013]  Hey, let us have world government or you're against the vets.
[00:57:15.554 --> 00:57:19.396]  Hey, turn on your guns or you're against black people, you know, or be for Obamacare.
[00:57:19.416 --> 00:57:21.358]  I mean, it's the same garbage.
[00:57:21.558 --> 00:57:22.979]  Old lies for new.
[00:57:23.439 --> 00:57:26.882]  Now, let's play a clip of Hillary, another hero, another commando.
[00:57:27.522 --> 00:57:28.483]  I'm like Private Lynch.
[00:57:28.523 --> 00:57:30.264]  We should put women in frontline combat.
[00:57:30.484 --> 00:57:33.106]  Put a 75-pound pack on Hillary, let me tell you.
[00:57:33.406 --> 00:57:34.307]  Now, let's go to that clip.
[00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:37.471]  I remember landing under sniper fire.
[00:57:38.151 --> 00:57:44.674]  In a speech last week, Senator Clinton was referring to her visit to Tuzla, Bosnia in 1996 as First Lady.
[00:57:46.315 --> 00:57:49.136]  The brutal war was over, but hostilities continued.
[00:57:49.536 --> 00:57:55.259]  And though the trip was exactly 12 years ago tomorrow, the memories seemed etched in Clinton's mind.
[00:57:56.019 --> 00:58:04.627]  There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.
[00:58:05.127 --> 00:58:07.169]  Problem is, that's not what happened.
[00:58:07.509 --> 00:58:08.330]  And we should know.
[00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:13.174]  CBS News accompanied the First Lady and daughter Chelsea on that Bosnia trip.
[00:58:13.695 --> 00:58:17.098]  That's Senator Clinton talking to me on the military flight into Tuzla.
[00:58:17.418 --> 00:58:21.162]  And these are the pictures we recorded of the greeting ceremony when the plane landed.
[00:58:21.522 --> 00:58:23.925]  Compare that to Senator Clinton's account.
[00:58:24.285 --> 00:58:26.287]  I remember landing under sniper fire.
[00:58:26.548 --> 00:58:27.929]  There was no greeting ceremony.
[00:58:28.409 --> 00:58:30.612]  And we basically were told to run to our cars.
[00:58:30.672 --> 00:58:33.595]  She told another lie about, oh, we were in the air when it got shot up.
[00:58:33.655 --> 00:58:36.278]  I mean, they're a pack of lying criminals.
[00:58:36.858 --> 00:58:41.039]  Okay, and these are the people that want you to take vaccines, and they tell you the federal reserve's federal.
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:41.740]  It's not.
[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:43.120]  It's a foreign-owned bank, okay?
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.001]  This is a criminal cabal.
[00:58:45.241 --> 00:58:47.121]  They are the enemy of America.
[00:58:47.222 --> 00:58:48.402]  Now, two sides, people.
[00:58:48.882 --> 00:58:49.502]  Two sides.
[00:58:49.982 --> 00:58:50.263]  Okay?
[00:58:51.183 --> 00:58:52.803]  They want to enslave you.
[00:58:53.564 --> 00:58:54.924]  They want to bankrupt you.
[00:58:54.984 --> 00:58:56.585]  They want to rule you.
[00:58:56.805 --> 00:58:57.525]  They want to rape you.
[00:58:59.437 --> 00:59:03.299]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:59:04.039 --> 00:59:10.322]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.

[00:59:29.414 --> 00:59:32.916]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:59:33.076 --> 00:59:37.039]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:59:37.359 --> 00:59:38.820]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:46.725]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:59:47.005 --> 00:59:47.846]  But for how long?

[00:59:50.347 --> 00:59:54.390]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:55.931]  Infidel Body Armor.
[00:59:56.651 --> 00:59:57.592]  Just won't quit.
[01:00:01.375 --> 01:00:03.989]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.305 --> 01:00:19.506]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:20.146 --> 01:00:20.946]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.706 --> 01:00:22.627]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.267 --> 01:00:26.908]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.448 --> 01:00:31.549]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.289 --> 01:00:36.550]  We got Gerald Cilente, World Trends Forecaster, joining us.
[01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:38.510]  We'll open the phones up for him as well.
[01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:41.331]  I haven't had time to get to this, but I'm really sick of it.
[01:00:42.231 --> 01:00:47.695]  Matthew McConaughey has been criticized all over national television, TMZ, you name it.
[01:00:47.735 --> 01:00:49.957]  He has a 22,000 acre ranch outside Austin.
[01:00:50.858 --> 01:00:53.239]  They're calling it canned hunts out there.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:58.363]  It's a cattle ranch, but they do have during season hunting.
[01:00:59.384 --> 01:01:00.805]  And they're saying it's a canned hunt.
[01:01:00.825 --> 01:01:03.147]  A canned hunt is an animal in a cage you let out and you shoot.
[01:01:04.246 --> 01:01:06.606]  I mean, white-tailed deer are like roaches.
[01:01:06.766 --> 01:01:08.827]  They're just dying everywhere, starving to death.
[01:01:09.087 --> 01:01:10.407]  Their population has never been higher.
[01:01:10.687 --> 01:01:20.069]  But the anti-human crowd wants to then bully and demonize with their phobia of Texans, their phobia of landowners, their phobia of hunting.
[01:01:21.289 --> 01:01:25.170]  Matthew McConaughey Ranch draws fire over trapped deer kills.
[01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:28.691]  And then they show, look, there's deer feeders.
[01:01:28.991 --> 01:01:30.171]  They're inside pens.
[01:01:31.397 --> 01:01:32.738]  Document Cam shot for TV viewers.
[01:01:33.619 --> 01:01:37.142]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's a 22,000 acre ranch, and of course they have corn feeders.
[01:01:37.322 --> 01:01:41.246]  I mean, they just prey on the ignorance of people that have never been out...
[01:01:42.222 --> 01:01:43.822]  In the woods, don't know about hunting.
[01:01:44.682 --> 01:01:46.303]  You take these deer, you process them.
[01:01:46.843 --> 01:01:51.684]  About, I don't know, I've heard it's up to 20% of the food the homeless get is deer sausage.
[01:01:51.724 --> 01:01:52.304]  It's excellent.
[01:01:53.204 --> 01:01:55.864]  And if you don't, we need more controlled kills of these whitetail.
[01:01:55.904 --> 01:01:57.505]  I mean, they are crawling.
[01:01:58.125 --> 01:01:58.805]  I live in Austin.
[01:01:58.905 --> 01:02:00.185]  I've run into them twice.
[01:02:00.265 --> 01:02:05.486]  Buckley almost got killed out by McConaughey's Ranch, strangely enough, when one jumped out in front of him one night.
[01:02:05.606 --> 01:02:09.767]  I mean, it is, you go in your front yard, anywhere in Austin, basically, and there'll be 50 deer at night.
[01:02:10.367 --> 01:02:13.770]  I mean, you're stumbling, and then they start starving to death, there's not enough food.
[01:02:14.711 --> 01:02:16.192]  Any plant they can get a hold of, they eat.
[01:02:16.212 --> 01:02:17.113]  They're like goats!
[01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:20.595]  There, I've talked about it.
[01:02:22.077 --> 01:02:23.778]  It's how they prey on people's ignorance.
[01:02:23.798 --> 01:02:26.921]  Like, they say, Obamacare's free, and there are no death panels, and blah, blah, blah.
[01:02:26.941 --> 01:02:28.082]  No, and you can't read the bill.
[01:02:28.122 --> 01:02:29.623]  The average person will not read the bill.
[01:02:31.544 --> 01:02:35.468]  Did you know that actor McConaughey is a co-founder of a canned hunting ranch?
[01:02:36.869 --> 01:02:38.390]  By the way, I'm against canned hunting.
[01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:39.730]  So is Dave Mustaine.
[01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:41.331]  He has a song about it, Countdown to Extinction.
[01:02:41.711 --> 01:02:51.596]  There are weirdos that is very rare, you know, that want like a lion or a tiger or a puma to be released out of a cage and then they shoot it right there.
[01:02:52.457 --> 01:02:55.058]  You know, some fat banker, you know, on a golf cart.
[01:02:55.278 --> 01:02:57.079]  They actually drive around on golf carts doing this.
[01:02:57.639 --> 01:02:59.000]  That's not what we're talking about.
[01:02:59.904 --> 01:03:03.787]  Or they'll bring in African ibex or whatever, and they're on a ranch.
[01:03:03.807 --> 01:03:04.628]  You've still got to hunt them.
[01:03:04.808 --> 01:03:05.389]  So what?
[01:03:06.089 --> 01:03:07.671]  It's a normal human activity.
[01:03:07.931 --> 01:03:09.853]  You don't shoot animals because you enjoy killing them.
[01:03:10.133 --> 01:03:12.355]  It's an instinct to get the animal, to butcher them.
[01:03:13.115 --> 01:03:15.798]  I've explained this.
[01:03:15.838 --> 01:03:16.518]  It's very complex.
[01:03:16.538 --> 01:03:17.139]  It's also very simple.
[01:03:17.439 --> 01:03:25.086]  When you do the ritual of hunting and the ritual of gutting an animal, it's on record, and most top union psychologists break it down.
[01:03:25.486 --> 01:03:26.387]  Carl Jung wrote about it.
[01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:31.032]  He was against hunting until he started actually going out and seeing and experiencing it.
[01:03:31.373 --> 01:03:35.136]  It activates all these tribal memories and programs and instincts.
[01:03:35.956 --> 01:03:41.601]  Okay, so... You need to crawl around in freezing temperatures with a bow.
[01:03:41.621 --> 01:03:42.882]  I mean, that's real hunting.
[01:03:43.362 --> 01:03:46.665]  And then kill wild hogs up close, and you know, they can sometimes even try to attack you.
[01:03:47.085 --> 01:03:55.192]  I've hunted hogs on horseback with spears, and with dogs, and boy, if they ever saw... I mean, you know... This just... I mean, let me tell you, it's dangerous.
[01:03:57.910 --> 01:04:00.292]  A lot of people that do it actually wear body armor on their legs.
[01:04:01.994 --> 01:04:03.515]  And I haven't done it in probably 20 years.
[01:04:03.535 --> 01:04:04.256]  I haven't had time.
[01:04:04.296 --> 01:04:05.477]  But it's very exciting.
[01:04:05.857 --> 01:04:07.118]  It's very fun.
[01:04:07.138 --> 01:04:12.744]  And it's not that I enjoy jumping off a horse and running up with a big spear and killing a hog that two pit bulls have got.
[01:04:13.264 --> 01:04:14.926]  It's that it's a normal human activity.
[01:04:14.966 --> 01:04:16.027]  My ancestors did it.
[01:04:16.427 --> 01:04:18.249]  And let me tell you, you get hired in a kite doing it.
[01:04:18.849 --> 01:04:21.551]  And it's not the killing the animal that you're getting off on.
[01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:27.815]  It's the fact that you got pigs snapping with huge tusks that wound and kill humans and dogs.
[01:04:28.195 --> 01:04:29.035]  I mean, it's vicious.
[01:04:29.736 --> 01:04:34.939]  And I'm sure they'll have a big media piece about Alex Jones defends McConaughey talking about killing hogs.
[01:04:35.359 --> 01:04:35.699]  That's it.
[01:04:35.759 --> 01:04:37.040]  I'm going to call some folks I know.
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:40.722]  I'm going to take a crew, and we're going to go hunt on horseback wild hogs.
[01:04:41.663 --> 01:04:43.024]  Throw that in the media's face.
[01:04:43.044 --> 01:04:46.546]  You don't like Matthew McConaughey trying to control this white-tailed deer population?
[01:04:46.866 --> 01:04:48.587]  And making some money to pay the property taxes on it?
[01:04:48.887 --> 01:04:49.447]  Watch this!
[01:04:49.707 --> 01:04:58.751]  I'm gonna jump off a horse with a big carbide steel spear and I'm gonna run up, French style, that's how they hunt them in France, and I'm gonna ram that spear right in that hog.
[01:04:59.011 --> 01:05:00.592]  See how you like that, New World Order.
[01:05:01.272 --> 01:05:04.213]  Because I'm a red-blooded human and I'm ready to fight.
[01:05:05.074 --> 01:05:06.234]  I'm ready to stand up.
[01:05:06.294 --> 01:05:07.675]  You haven't shut off my instincts.
[01:05:09.198 --> 01:05:12.401]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:05:12.701 --> 01:05:20.708]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:05:20.948 --> 01:05:25.972]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:14.013]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:14.594 --> 01:08:17.398]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:25.763 --> 01:08:32.487]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, we'll start taking some of your questions and comments for the top trends forecaster out there.
[01:08:32.507 --> 01:08:37.850]  Best-selling author, researcher, former government consultant and advisor, Gerald Cilente.
[01:08:38.310 --> 01:08:40.291]  Trends Journal, history before it happens.
[01:08:40.772 --> 01:08:45.995]  The grand manipulation, backroom deals go global in the rigged economy.
[01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:53.262]  We're going to break down his latest journal to come out, forecasting worldwide since 1980.
[01:08:54.163 --> 01:09:02.072]  Then in the third hour today, we're going to open the phones up again to talk about your vaccine stories, the good, the bad, the ugly.
[01:09:02.312 --> 01:09:03.013]  You want to debate me?
[01:09:03.033 --> 01:09:05.055]  You want to say you think forced inoculation is great?
[01:09:05.436 --> 01:09:06.276]  You want to call in?
[01:09:06.497 --> 01:09:06.817]  Fine.
[01:09:06.917 --> 01:09:07.998]  Nobody did yesterday.
[01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:09.060]  We had people
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:15.463]  Kids dying, spontaneous miscarriages, people getting polio from the polio vaccine.
[01:09:15.763 --> 01:09:17.043]  By the way, that's in the news today.
[01:09:17.623 --> 01:09:21.605]  Americans getting polio from the polio vaccine or getting it from their vaccinated kids.
[01:09:22.005 --> 01:09:24.346]  Most of the measles is being spread by the measles vaccine.
[01:09:24.566 --> 01:09:26.347]  That's actually buried in these news articles.
[01:09:27.348 --> 01:09:29.228]  So we're going to talk about that in the third hour.
[01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:36.671]  Also coming up, this is strangely enough out of the Associated Press.
[01:09:39.056 --> 01:09:44.460]  Local officials complain they were left in dark on New Jersey Ebola quarantine center.
[01:09:44.961 --> 01:09:49.424]  Now remember, Obama said this is a dry run for something that's going to be airborne in the future.
[01:09:50.145 --> 01:09:51.325]  He was quite honest about that.
[01:09:51.726 --> 01:09:58.131]  All we know is they were disappearing people saying they had Ebola, and I had doctors on by name saying where this was happening.
[01:09:58.471 --> 01:10:05.997]  We then talked to, let's not exaggerate, 15 or more other doctors, another one known by us personally, who manages
[01:10:08.212 --> 01:10:09.053]  Huge facilities.
[01:10:09.073 --> 01:10:11.617]  Okay, this is a director of a hospital group.
[01:10:12.619 --> 01:10:14.161]  He said, yeah, we're worried about liability.
[01:10:15.213 --> 01:10:18.015]  It looks like they have Ebola, they're disappearing, and people are now like, where's the Ebola?
[01:10:18.055 --> 01:10:18.735]  I thought it was horrible.
[01:10:19.155 --> 01:10:20.256]  They're covering it up.
[01:10:20.736 --> 01:10:22.618]  Well, now here it is in mainstream news.
[01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:25.800]  So that's coming up in the next hour as well.
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:27.280]  I don't know how bad it is.
[01:10:27.361 --> 01:10:28.801]  I've just been saying it's going on.
[01:10:29.302 --> 01:10:33.044]  And Forbes came out and said we were in a meeting with the CDC director, with a bunch of media.
[01:10:33.064 --> 01:10:34.265]  We agreed to cover it up.
[01:10:35.085 --> 01:10:36.126]  Other articles came out.
[01:10:36.546 --> 01:10:37.247]  This is going on.
[01:10:37.987 --> 01:10:43.053]  I don't know if there's 10 cases or 100 or if they're grabbing people that look like they have it, they really have bad malaria.
[01:10:43.974 --> 01:10:44.315]  I don't know.
[01:10:44.355 --> 01:10:46.818]  They're setting the precedent to secretly disappear people.
[01:10:47.639 --> 01:10:51.924]  As Senator Rand Paul warned, forced inoculation is medical martial law.
[01:10:53.561 --> 01:10:55.822]  Now, at the bottom of the hour, it's a four-minute report.
[01:10:56.362 --> 01:10:57.363]  We'll keep Gerald with us.
[01:10:57.383 --> 01:10:58.243]  We'll get his take on it.
[01:10:58.763 --> 01:11:02.044]  Dealing with these black boxes that Progressive Insurance and others are pushing.
[01:11:02.325 --> 01:11:05.426]  They want to make a mandatory now to tax you and track you by the mile.
[01:11:05.826 --> 01:11:07.727]  They're saying hackers can hack and take you over.
[01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:17.987]  Well, Biggs demonstrates how dangerous this is with LeeAnn McAdoo and, of course, Darren McBreen, and the pieces up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:11:18.328 --> 01:11:25.570]  Car hacking, someone dies at the end, is the name of the article that has the video, and it's really high production quality.
[01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:30.572]  McBreen has outdone himself with Joe Biggs being blown up in the car.
[01:11:31.232 --> 01:11:35.634]  It's history channel quality stuff, and I'm just so proud of the crew.
[01:11:36.354 --> 01:11:45.085]  Now, going to our guest, Gerald Solente, again, TrendsJournal.com, TrendsResearch.com.
[01:11:45.606 --> 01:11:48.350]  You can also sign up there for his free trends updates.
[01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:50.873]  We really appreciate him joining us.
[01:11:51.193 --> 01:11:52.735]  He's an American trends forecaster.
[01:11:53.717 --> 01:12:06.156]  Publisher of the Trends Journal, business consultant, and author who makes predictions about the global financial markets, he's had number one New York Times bestsellers, and other events of historical importance, Salente has described himself as a political atheist and a citizen of the world.
[01:12:06.909 --> 01:12:19.539]  He's appeared on a guest television on shows such as Oprah Winfrey, The Today Show, Good Morning America, CBS News Morning, Glenn Beck, NBC Nightly News, Alex Jones Show, Russia Today, and many more, friendsresearch.com.
[01:12:20.099 --> 01:12:32.389]  And he joins us, but I got a sneaking suspicion, because he was on hold earlier when I talked about Brian Williams, that he's probably got something to say about another stolen glory felony like Hillary Clinton.
[01:12:32.409 --> 01:12:34.651]  Gerald, what's your take on Brian Williams?
[01:12:35.785 --> 01:12:37.407]  It's a big story, Alex.
[01:12:37.747 --> 01:12:40.410]  Not because he's just a typical prostitute.
[01:12:41.151 --> 01:12:45.355]  Because these are the people that lied us into the Iraq War.
[01:12:46.556 --> 01:12:48.798]  These are the ones that sold the war.
[01:12:49.519 --> 01:12:54.344]  And little low-life boys like him just keep selling it.
[01:12:55.185 --> 01:12:57.307]  A war based on lies.
[01:12:58.468 --> 01:13:03.752]  And they just keep the lie going by bringing it to whole new levels.
[01:13:04.233 --> 01:13:09.978]  We did a Trends Journal report, a special report, back in...
[01:13:12.063 --> 01:13:34.958]  June of 2008, and we had some quotes from people like Katie Couric in response to Scott McClellan's book, who showed how he was the spokesperson there, the con man for Bush for a while, his press secretary, and showing how that they pushed the war.
[01:13:35.319 --> 01:13:37.200]  Here's a quote from Katie Couric.
[01:13:39.099 --> 01:13:53.748]  She says, quote, there was such a significant march to war and people who questioned it very early on, and really as the war progressed, were considered unpatriotic.
[01:13:54.628 --> 01:13:58.774]  There was a lot of pressure from the Bush White House.
[01:13:59.615 --> 01:14:09.268]  There was a sense of pressure from the corporations who own where we work and from government itself.
[01:14:09.929 --> 01:14:13.551]  To really squash any kind of dissent.
[01:14:13.931 --> 01:14:15.712]  This is from Katie Couric.
[01:14:16.153 --> 01:14:19.555]  This is from the woman who you might want to remember.
[01:14:19.975 --> 01:14:29.861]  She was the one that said as the war broke out, I just want you to know, I think Navy SEALS ROCK!
[01:14:30.959 --> 01:14:33.262]  So you got one quote after another.
[01:14:33.282 --> 01:14:38.969]  This is from Jessica Yellen when she was with MSNBC.
[01:14:39.089 --> 01:14:46.418]  Quote, the press corps was under enormous pressure from corporate executives, frankly, to make sure
[01:14:46.858 --> 01:14:55.582]  This was a war that was presented in a way that was consistent with the patriotic fervor of the nation.
[01:14:55.822 --> 01:14:59.384]  Boy, Goering and Hitler would have been proud of these people.
[01:14:59.764 --> 01:15:04.946]  What a bunch of low-life little scum and scummets!
[01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:08.228]  And Brian Williams is just one of them.
[01:15:08.668 --> 01:15:10.869]  Another little boy with a
[01:15:11.049 --> 01:15:16.553]  A big mouth, a bad attitude, and Cajones the size of a mothball.
[01:15:17.133 --> 01:15:17.794]  I go on.
[01:15:19.174 --> 01:15:25.579]  I was in Kuwait for the build-up of the war, and yes, we heard from the Pentagon.
[01:15:26.159 --> 01:15:36.206]  On my cell phone, the minute they heard us report something that they didn't like, the tone at the time was quite extraordinary.
[01:15:36.226 --> 01:15:37.347]  Hey, you know who said that?
[01:15:38.391 --> 01:15:54.841]  NBC's Brian Williams going back to yelling, the higher the president's ratings, the more pressure I had from news executives to put on a positive story about the president.
[01:15:55.521 --> 01:15:57.382]  This is America?
[01:15:57.802 --> 01:16:00.303]  You people are disgusting!
[01:16:00.663 --> 01:16:05.406]  You'll get sold out and buy out for pennies on the dolly.
[01:16:05.426 --> 01:16:06.026]  You know why?
[01:16:06.046 --> 01:16:07.767]  Because you're prostitutes.
[01:16:08.107 --> 01:16:09.007]  You're whores.
[01:16:09.467 --> 01:16:13.429]  These are whores for a war based on lies.
[01:16:13.869 --> 01:16:14.890]  Based on lies?
[01:16:15.330 --> 01:16:16.331]  Let's remember this.
[01:16:16.351 --> 01:16:19.773]  Gerald, I want to go to that, but since you mentioned this, I was going to bring this up later.
[01:16:20.293 --> 01:16:22.915]  MSNBC suffers lowest ratings in a decade.
[01:16:23.355 --> 01:16:28.618]  They only have, it says, 55,000 viewers an hour in a key demographic.
[01:16:28.658 --> 01:16:29.699]  Their average show a little over 100,000.
[01:16:29.739 --> 01:16:32.160]  Their top shows about 250,000.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.641]  That is joke level.
[01:16:34.681 --> 01:16:37.903]  I mean, you do one YouTube video and it has 200,000 views.
[01:16:37.943 --> 01:16:38.944]  This is incredible.
[01:16:38.964 --> 01:16:39.784]  But last night,
[01:16:40.965 --> 01:16:52.812]  I called this reporter, Kelly Evans, that attacked Senator Rand Paul for saying we shouldn't be forced to take vaccines and engaging in propaganda and saying vaccines are totally safe and effective.
[01:16:53.132 --> 01:16:55.773]  I called her a media whore, pimping out her audience.
[01:16:55.853 --> 01:17:02.117]  Well, notice MSNBC, CNBC, Media Matters, Raw Story, they all ran similar headlines.
[01:17:02.537 --> 01:17:04.919]  Because they all take their talking points from media matters.
[01:17:04.939 --> 01:17:07.961]  They write the first article, the White House runs it, then they copy it.
[01:17:07.981 --> 01:17:11.023]  So a direct White House talking point, speaking about talking points.
[01:17:11.543 --> 01:17:20.148]  Alex Jones defends listener Rand Paul on vaccines by attacking whore, they have that in quotes, trash, tramp, filth, scum.
[01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:26.653]  Now you actually read the transcript, they admit, I called her a media whore and using your term, a prostitute, even gave you credit for that.
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:30.721]  But then, oh, Gerald Solinte is calling her a streetwalker, or I am.
[01:17:30.781 --> 01:17:31.282]  No, we're not.
[01:17:31.642 --> 01:17:38.905]  A streetwalker has a lot more credibility than these ghoulish vampires getting all these pharmaceutical dollars and selling wars and the rest of it.
[01:17:39.125 --> 01:17:45.068]  And then there's such media whores, they imply that I physically called her a streetwalker when I never did that.
[01:17:45.328 --> 01:17:47.009]  This is why they have no viewers, Gerald.
[01:17:47.169 --> 01:17:48.690]  They're a pack of lying scum.
[01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:49.310]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:17:49.870 --> 01:17:50.430]  Oh, they are.
[01:17:50.490 --> 01:17:54.552]  Here's another quote, by the way, from another piece of lying scum.
[01:17:55.113 --> 01:17:56.793]  This was Charlie Gibson.
[01:17:56.853 --> 01:17:58.854]  Everybody loved him on ABC.
[01:17:59.595 --> 01:18:04.297]  Quote, I can remember getting in trouble with administration officials.
[01:18:04.697 --> 01:18:06.818]  Oh, you got in trouble, little Charlie?
[01:18:06.838 --> 01:18:07.398]  Ooh!
[01:18:07.798 --> 01:18:12.561]  Because of asking questions they didn't feel comfortable with.
[01:18:13.141 --> 01:18:15.742]  Why, you little boy!
[01:18:16.543 --> 01:18:17.163]  I'll go on.
[01:18:18.544 --> 01:18:27.910]  There was just a drumbeat of support from the administration, and it is not our job to debate them!
[01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:29.671]  Fourth Estate?
[01:18:30.011 --> 01:18:30.931]  No, man!
[01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:36.855]  You're working on the estate that's the brothel down the corner from the White House!
[01:18:37.195 --> 01:18:38.876]  You are a prostitute!
[01:18:38.916 --> 01:18:42.118]  Do you agree that actual hookers are a lot more moral than these people?
[01:18:43.277 --> 01:18:44.638]  Nah, they both do it.
[01:18:44.678 --> 01:18:47.700]  They'll, you know, they get paid for a couple of bucks to do anything.
[01:18:48.101 --> 01:18:51.723]  You name the trick, you give them enough money and they'll do it.
[01:18:51.763 --> 01:18:54.125]  They all show their colors here.
[01:18:54.605 --> 01:18:58.628]  Every one of these people admitted what cowards they are.
[01:18:59.069 --> 01:19:02.071]  Katie Cork, hey, I got pressure from the corporation.
[01:19:02.351 --> 01:19:04.232]  You think I want to lose my job?
[01:19:04.392 --> 01:19:04.713]  No!
[01:19:05.333 --> 01:19:10.396]  Charlie Gibson, we shouldn't question them, but boy, they'll grill you or me, won't they?
[01:19:10.757 --> 01:19:13.118]  These are all little lying people.
[01:19:13.418 --> 01:19:17.241]  They are a disgrace to America, because here's the big deal here, Alex.
[01:19:17.841 --> 01:19:21.624]  They sold us a war based on lies.
[01:19:22.204 --> 01:19:27.848]  And here was from one of the second-in-command of the Liars-in-Chief.
[01:19:30.868 --> 01:19:42.358]  Vice President Dick Cheney said in his pre-war pitch, quote, simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction.
[01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:49.684]  There is no doubt that he's amassing them to use them against, you know he's going to use them against our friends.
[01:19:49.784 --> 01:19:51.065]  Oh yeah, your friends and mine.
[01:19:51.085 --> 01:19:54.028]  Dick Cheney, another lying, prostitute whore.
[01:19:54.868 --> 01:19:55.709]  Or a king whore.
[01:19:55.769 --> 01:19:56.370]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:57.511]  Gerald, finish the whole quote.
[01:19:57.792 --> 01:19:59.333]  Gerald Cilente is our guest.
[01:19:59.754 --> 01:20:00.455]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:00.475 --> 01:20:05.801]  There's our mighty control room crew doing a fabulous job putting up documents and articles for every claim we make.
[01:20:09.447 --> 01:20:11.729]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?
[01:20:12.349 --> 01:20:15.611]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:20:15.892 --> 01:20:17.693]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:20:18.053 --> 01:20:27.079]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[01:20:27.359 --> 01:20:33.003]  Plus, Big Berkey water filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.
[01:20:33.363 --> 01:20:39.087]  Tested by multiple independent NSF EPA certified labs, they are the gold standard in water purification.
[01:20:39.087 --> 01:20:39.727]  I think so.
[01:21:09.045 --> 01:21:09.485]  Gold.
[01:21:09.846 --> 01:21:11.106]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:17.491]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:17.651 --> 01:21:21.474]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:21.814 --> 01:21:23.715]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:23.755 --> 01:21:26.037]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:26.197 --> 01:21:33.302]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every
[01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:34.203]  We're good to go.
[01:21:49.063 --> 01:21:54.689]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report of Fed hopes you'll never see.

[01:22:11.084 --> 01:22:15.946]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:16.186 --> 01:22:24.088]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:24.308 --> 01:22:28.630]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:32.651]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:32.811 --> 01:22:38.514]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:38.754 --> 01:22:41.536]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:41.916 --> 01:22:47.139]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:24:15.992 --> 01:24:16.673]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:24:16.733 --> 01:24:17.654]  Gerald Salente is our guest.
[01:24:17.674 --> 01:24:25.401]  We're going to open the phones up later in the hour for your questions or comments for Gerald, specifically on trends or news items.
[01:24:25.421 --> 01:24:26.041]  800-259-9231.
[01:24:26.101 --> 01:24:27.462]  Let's have some first-time callers.
[01:24:27.482 --> 01:24:29.324]  It'll be wide open phones in the third hour.
[01:24:29.344 --> 01:24:29.384]  800-259-9231.
[01:24:29.404 --> 01:24:31.586]  Gerald, we all know about the WMD lies, the bipartisan fraud,
[01:24:41.018 --> 01:24:45.199]  But I love how these prostitutes come out later, like Gibbs, and says, yeah, of course drones are operating.
[01:24:45.479 --> 01:24:46.299]  They're killing people.
[01:24:46.339 --> 01:24:49.580]  We're told to say it doesn't exist, even though it's public.
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:56.002]  But I think they've jumped the shark, saying 2 plus 2 equals 5, and raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit.
[01:24:57.062 --> 01:24:58.222]  I mean, look at MSNBC.
[01:24:58.362 --> 01:25:00.363]  Inside MSNBC's impending shakeup.
[01:25:00.743 --> 01:25:01.923]  Cancellation, reboots.
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:06.082]  Well, I mean, you can't resurrect a person that's this dead.
[01:25:06.702 --> 01:25:10.144]  They represent a view that's popular with 7% of the American people.
[01:25:10.785 --> 01:25:12.306]  That's what Congress's approval rating is.
[01:25:12.786 --> 01:25:14.587]  I don't see how they can resurrect themselves.
[01:25:14.947 --> 01:25:18.369]  Have the walking dead... In fact, that's what the mainstream media is.
[01:25:18.389 --> 01:25:20.410]  They're prostitutes, they're dinosaur media, my term.
[01:25:20.891 --> 01:25:22.972]  But I really think they're the walking dead media.
[01:25:23.772 --> 01:25:26.434]  I mean, do they understand how hated they are?
[01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:30.977]  And the fact that almost no one even watches them anymore, Gerald?
[01:25:31.789 --> 01:25:34.993]  The prostitutes care?
[01:25:35.474 --> 01:25:36.916]  No, as long as they get paid.
[01:25:37.356 --> 01:25:38.618]  And here's the deal, Alex.
[01:25:38.658 --> 01:25:40.080]  This is a much bigger story.
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:42.423]  Again, that's why I wanted to talk about it.
[01:25:43.123 --> 01:25:45.026]  They lied us into war.
[01:25:45.507 --> 01:25:46.768]  The facts are there.
[01:25:47.898 --> 01:25:56.764]  From Cheney beginning the lies, Bush keeping them going, Condoleezza Rice and Colin, the perfect word for what happened.
[01:25:56.784 --> 01:25:57.704]  Condom and Colin, yeah.
[01:25:57.764 --> 01:25:58.445]  That'll be a law firm.
[01:25:59.045 --> 01:26:00.866]  Yeah.
[01:26:01.326 --> 01:26:06.009]  They lied us into war, and these people facilitated it.
[01:26:06.490 --> 01:26:08.291]  This is a big story!
[01:26:08.911 --> 01:26:13.939]  They have slaughtered how many, what is the estimate, a million people?
[01:26:13.959 --> 01:26:16.103]  1.3 million lands at Medical Journal as of 2008.
[01:26:16.163 --> 01:26:17.545]  God knows what it is now.
[01:26:18.877 --> 01:26:24.639]  And what are we, we're seeing our troops, 22 of them committing suicide a day?
[01:26:24.659 --> 01:26:29.220]  Oh, they got them on secret death lists, they won't even give them health care.
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:29.900]  22 a day?
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:47.165]  So what I'm saying is, the importance of this is that little low-life boys and girls like Katie Couric and Brian Williams, Janet Yellen, Charlie Gibson, oh by the way, FAIR, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting,
[01:26:47.805 --> 01:26:52.229]  They had done a study of the lead up to the Iraq War.
[01:26:52.949 --> 01:26:57.453]  They only brought in 1% of the people to talk against the war.
[01:26:57.713 --> 01:27:01.557]  The rest were all in favor, and only 6% knew.
[01:27:01.717 --> 01:27:08.182]  Donahue had the top ratings, 5 million viewers a night on MSNBC, and they fired him because he was a real liberal.
[01:27:08.403 --> 01:27:11.946]  He was actually against the war and torture, so they fired their only star.
[01:27:12.206 --> 01:27:15.328]  And they fired Ventura because he was against it too.
[01:27:16.354 --> 01:27:21.676]  So the importance of this is how easily propaganda sells.
[01:27:22.396 --> 01:27:28.738]  And what I keep telling people, you know, Mr. Sollenti, what are some good business opportunities for me?
[01:27:29.318 --> 01:27:31.698]  And I say, look, the big one is propaganda.
[01:27:32.098 --> 01:27:36.380]  You could do it cheaply, stupidly, and you could get great results.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:40.301]  So I'm mentioning this because of the Iraq War.
[01:27:41.081 --> 01:27:42.922]  That's costing us, according to what?
[01:27:42.982 --> 01:27:45.003]  Stiglitz, about three trillion dollars?
[01:27:45.023 --> 01:27:48.926]  And, based on lies, but here's the important element.
[01:27:50.251 --> 01:27:59.859]  Just as these little low-life people sold us the Iraq War, get ready for them to sell us the next one!
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:06.745]  And the power of the mainstream media should not be really downplayed.
[01:28:07.246 --> 01:28:13.631]  Even though a lot of people don't follow them anymore, the people pick up the sound bites from them.
[01:28:13.651 --> 01:28:14.492]  No, no, I totally agree.
[01:28:14.992 --> 01:28:17.495]  Exactly, and what I'm saying is just as they sold us the Iraq War,
[01:28:37.054 --> 01:28:57.466]  Just as they keep selling the Iraq and Afghan war, get ready for these same little people of no morality, no dignity, and no self-respect to bow down, suck up, and start selling us the next war.
[01:28:57.847 --> 01:28:59.488]  The proof is here!
[01:29:00.188 --> 01:29:03.511]  The proof is in the lies stated by... You know, that's true.
[01:29:03.571 --> 01:29:05.313]  They helped put ISIS and Al Qaeda in.
[01:29:05.613 --> 01:29:06.614]  Now we've got to go fight them.
[01:29:06.634 --> 01:29:08.235]  Our troops have got to go die fighting them.
[01:29:08.556 --> 01:29:11.959]  It'll be a real war, but a staged event helping them get into power.
[01:29:12.359 --> 01:29:18.004]  And then these people sit back, not facing any of the gunfire, but then claiming they were under gunfire.
[01:29:18.024 --> 01:29:21.007]  Because Brian Williams wants to be a hero on top of it.
[01:29:21.307 --> 01:29:22.268]  He is such a fraud.
[01:29:23.188 --> 01:29:23.609]  Total.
[01:29:24.089 --> 01:29:29.075]  A total like the rest of them whose names I mentioned and whose quotes I read.
[01:29:29.575 --> 01:29:31.938]  I'm not casting judgment from them.
[01:29:32.398 --> 01:29:39.026]  I am analyzing their words and giving a description for who they are from what they said.
[01:29:39.046 --> 01:29:41.048]  They are media whores.
[01:29:42.318 --> 01:29:42.858]  Prostitutes.
[01:29:43.119 --> 01:29:44.780]  They are whores of the system.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:45.461]  I mean, it's just a fact.
[01:29:45.801 --> 01:29:46.642]  And they should be proud of that.
[01:29:46.682 --> 01:29:47.843]  I mean, they should put a red light out.
[01:29:47.863 --> 01:29:49.024]  I guess they kind of have.
[01:29:49.604 --> 01:29:52.427]  Gerald, let's come back, get into some of the top trends, and then phone calls.
[01:29:52.667 --> 01:29:57.291]  But we have this special report first that's very powerful on hacking cars.
[01:29:57.691 --> 01:29:58.152]  Stay with us.
[01:29:58.592 --> 01:29:59.513]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.013 --> 01:30:01.615]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.535 --> 01:30:05.218]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.634 --> 01:30:15.421]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.

[01:32:16.008 --> 01:32:17.029]  Security alert.
[01:32:17.229 --> 01:32:18.969]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:19.870]  Analysis.
[01:32:20.130 --> 01:32:20.790]  InfoWars.
[01:32:20.850 --> 01:32:22.931]  Building independent media operations.
[01:32:22.951 --> 01:32:27.793]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:27.833 --> 01:32:28.773]  Prime Directive.
[01:32:28.853 --> 01:32:30.334]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:30.414 --> 01:32:33.195]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:33.255 --> 01:32:36.316]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:36.496 --> 01:32:38.677]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:38.797 --> 01:32:40.278]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:32:40.318 --> 01:32:42.659]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:44.820]  They are never going to stop.
[01:32:45.101 --> 01:32:49.023]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:32:52.745 --> 01:32:55.407]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:32:56.107 --> 01:32:56.827]  Imperative.
[01:32:57.088 --> 01:32:58.929]  Destroy criminal in it.
[01:32:58.949 --> 01:32:59.089]  TV.
[01:32:59.129 --> 01:33:03.511]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:33:03.651 --> 01:33:05.172]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:33:05.192 --> 01:33:05.933]  You can feel it.
[01:33:10.549 --> 01:33:12.290]  This is an emergency transmission.
[01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:26.234]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA Region 6 in Occupy
[01:33:33.035 --> 01:33:33.977]  There is a war.
[01:33:34.458 --> 01:33:35.460]  It's happening now.
[01:33:36.341 --> 01:33:38.144]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[01:33:38.706 --> 01:33:40.489]  The time to choose sides has come.
[01:33:41.290 --> 01:33:42.733]  We are the resistance.
[01:33:43.194 --> 01:33:44.857]  We are the InfoWars.
[01:33:52.196 --> 01:33:54.457]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:33:54.697 --> 01:34:01.761]  Now back in 2011, we wrote an article here at InfoWars talking about the Progressive Auto Insurance Dongle, the Snapshot.
[01:34:01.841 --> 01:34:07.684]  Now what that is, is a device you plug into your car that allows Progressive to see whether or not you are a safe driver.
[01:34:07.964 --> 01:34:16.509]  It monitors your speed, your braking habits, all of that good stuff, and it sends the information back to them and lets them know if they should lower your insurance or not.
[01:34:16.909 --> 01:34:26.252]  Well, here we are, 2015, and we now know, based off of Forbes and the Hacker News, that this is a device that can be easily hacked into.
[01:34:26.592 --> 01:34:30.433]  They can stop your brakes, accelerate your car, and do pretty much whatever.
[01:34:30.974 --> 01:34:38.176]  Now, we all know the incident that happened with my friend Michael Hasings, where his car just shot down the road, exploded, hit a tree.
[01:34:39.016 --> 01:34:41.217]  This is something that we live in now, a digital age.
[01:34:42.037 --> 01:34:49.301]  We are now at a point where almost every car is able to be hacked into because we have these computer systems inside it.
[01:34:49.821 --> 01:34:57.044]  Now they're trying to get you to plug a device into your car that will actually allow hackers to get into it.
[01:34:57.445 --> 01:35:06.409]  So just a few days after Michael Hasings died, I received in the mail from Progressive Auto Insurance, because that's who I had at the time, was this box that said the snapshot.
[01:35:06.929 --> 01:35:07.670]  Open it up and
[01:35:08.430 --> 01:35:11.272]  It says plug it into your car and get your insurance rate lowered.
[01:35:11.692 --> 01:35:15.394]  Well, I threw that away because I was disgusted by the fact of what just happened to my friend.
[01:35:15.754 --> 01:35:17.736]  I didn't trust anything being put into my car.
[01:35:18.936 --> 01:35:24.560]  But wonder what would happen if I hadn't thrown that away and I actually plugged that device into my car.
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:25.200]  Hey!
[01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:26.621]  What are you looking at?
[01:35:26.781 --> 01:35:27.421]  What's going on?
[01:35:28.282 --> 01:35:31.183]  Well, you look like you're here to save some money on your car insurance.
[01:35:31.964 --> 01:35:33.745]  Yeah, I'm just... I don't know what I should get.
[01:35:33.765 --> 01:35:35.626]  I was checking the snapshot thing out.
[01:35:35.646 --> 01:35:36.046]  What do you mean?
[01:35:36.066 --> 01:35:36.807]  What do you know about it?
[01:35:37.612 --> 01:35:41.875]  Well, basically you just need to agree to let us track all of your movements.
[01:35:41.915 --> 01:35:44.236]  This will just easily plug into your car.
[01:35:44.296 --> 01:35:47.018]  We'll track your movements, upload it online.
[01:35:47.618 --> 01:35:52.421]  Probably the cloud will be really helpful, so we can just kind of see if you're a safe driver.
[01:35:53.342 --> 01:35:56.964]  Well, I saw in a Forbes article that these things could be haptive.
[01:35:57.024 --> 01:35:58.205]  Do you know anything about that?
[01:35:58.786 --> 01:35:59.186]  Forbes?
[01:35:59.666 --> 01:36:00.306]  Huh.
[01:36:00.807 --> 01:36:01.427]  I don't think so.
[01:36:01.547 --> 01:36:02.088]  Is it safe?
[01:36:02.408 --> 01:36:03.048]  Very safe.
[01:36:03.589 --> 01:36:04.309]  And effective.
[01:36:04.633 --> 01:36:05.674]  Well, I guess I'll go with this.
[01:36:05.834 --> 01:36:07.475]  It seems like a good thing to try.
[01:36:08.095 --> 01:36:24.245]  You're making the right decision.
[01:36:24.265 --> 01:36:28.068]  Sweet.
[01:36:28.088 --> 01:36:31.030]  And sure enough, he had a big story on CIA corruption coming out.
[01:36:31.912 --> 01:36:43.159]  He had, uh, he was in contact with WikiLeaks, was about to do a big data dump, and the official WikiLeaks has come out and said they talked to him one hour before his car blew up, and he said, the FBI's after me.
[01:36:44.039 --> 01:36:45.280]  They're investigating me.
[01:36:46.081 --> 01:36:47.561]  We've got to hurry up and get this done.
[01:36:47.682 --> 01:36:49.283]  Well, they got you done.
[01:36:50.883 --> 01:36:53.825]  And the police instantly said no foul play, which is always suspicious.
[01:36:54.165 --> 01:36:55.887]  The engine got blown down the road.
[01:36:56.187 --> 01:36:59.729]  Witnesses said the car caught on fire and blew up driving down the street.
[01:37:04.491 --> 01:37:04.671]  Yes.
[01:37:04.691 --> 01:37:06.192]  I have the target now.
[01:37:07.252 --> 01:37:08.312]  No, it is in the ringleader.
[01:37:08.552 --> 01:37:09.953]  It's codename, Little Biggs.
[01:37:12.193 --> 01:37:13.714]  Yes, target is in the vehicle.
[01:37:15.474 --> 01:37:16.614]  Do I have the go-ahead to terminate?
[01:37:18.335 --> 01:37:18.615]  Roger.
[01:37:18.895 --> 01:37:19.735]  Standing by for clearance.
[01:37:22.996 --> 01:37:23.416]  Roger that.
[01:37:23.736 --> 01:37:24.577]  Termination is a go.
[01:37:25.937 --> 01:37:26.497]  Cutting brakes.
[01:37:28.458 --> 01:37:29.378]  Disabling airbags.
[01:37:30.818 --> 01:37:32.399]  Accelerating car to a high speed.
[01:37:42.327 --> 01:37:43.650]  The target is no longer a threat.
[01:37:51.206 --> 01:37:52.589]  One down, five to go.
[01:38:05.234 --> 01:38:07.916]  That report is up on Infowars.com.
[01:38:07.976 --> 01:38:08.877]  It's very powerful.
[01:38:08.897 --> 01:38:10.178]  It deserves to get millions of views.
[01:38:10.238 --> 01:38:10.879]  It needs to.
[01:38:11.399 --> 01:38:12.500]  Car hacking.
[01:38:12.901 --> 01:38:16.124]  Someone dies at the end, is the name of the video.
[01:38:17.005 --> 01:38:26.769]  We're going to retweet it, Facebook it, please put it on your Twitter, your Facebook, because all of the appliances in your house, everything, the government admits is to be controlled and surveilled.
[01:38:27.290 --> 01:38:31.992]  Samsung has come out and said their televisions are watching and listening to you, so quote, watch what you have to say.
[01:38:32.412 --> 01:38:44.598]  Gerald Cilente, I want to get into Trends here with you, and of course TrendsResearch.com, and I want to break that down and then take some calls, but hearing that report, folks can go to the site and see it, it's more powerful if you see it,
[01:38:45.598 --> 01:38:53.643]  This is really what's going on, and we believe, and we went to California to investigate, that Hastings was basically hacked and driven into the tree.
[01:38:54.523 --> 01:38:56.144]  We talked to his family and others.
[01:38:56.184 --> 01:39:01.668]  He was running from his life, from the feds and a Homeland Security counterterrorism force.
[01:39:02.288 --> 01:39:03.989]  He was involved in secret operations.
[01:39:04.009 --> 01:39:05.310]  He was probably CIA.
[01:39:06.010 --> 01:39:08.452]  We talked to his wife, who thought he'd been probably killed.
[01:39:08.472 --> 01:39:09.372]  Joe Biggs knew her.
[01:39:09.613 --> 01:39:10.273]  Went to the funeral.
[01:39:10.333 --> 01:39:11.494]  He was good friends with Hastings.
[01:39:12.214 --> 01:39:13.495]  And then she changed her whole story.
[01:39:15.396 --> 01:39:21.161]  Regardless, the technology itself to surveil and tax us by the mile, and now it's all being announced.
[01:39:21.201 --> 01:39:23.823]  Are we stupid enough to let this happen, Gerald Cilente?
[01:39:24.483 --> 01:39:26.505]  Well, we're not, but most people are.
[01:39:26.525 --> 01:39:30.789]  And it just goes back to what you were talking about with the vaccinations.
[01:39:31.229 --> 01:39:38.015]  How would that woman on Fox say something to the effect that, you know, this is a time when you should listen to Big Brother?
[01:39:38.985 --> 01:39:47.313]  So, fear and hysteria are very easy sales to make, and it goes back to the Brian Williams, it goes back to propaganda.
[01:39:47.933 --> 01:39:57.462]  So there are people like us, and that's why they attack people like you and me, because we don't take their baloney or buy their BS, and we can't be paid off.
[01:39:57.862 --> 01:40:03.867]  We say what we believe and what we think is factual, rather than sucking up and selling their lies.
[01:40:04.708 --> 01:40:11.896]  So, I think the majority of Americans will gladly buy it because, quote, they're going to protect us and make us safe.
[01:40:12.297 --> 01:40:13.938]  Just like with this vaccination thing.
[01:40:13.978 --> 01:40:17.502]  By the way, here's a story that no one's talking about in the news.
[01:40:17.963 --> 01:40:20.325]  I started going back and looking up some old research.
[01:40:20.926 --> 01:40:23.028]  I remember when they were selling
[01:40:24.153 --> 01:40:26.055]  Estrogen for women.
[01:40:26.515 --> 01:40:27.896]  Hormone replacement.
[01:40:27.936 --> 01:40:29.497]  You're getting into menopause?
[01:40:29.838 --> 01:40:31.399]  We've got a solution for you.
[01:40:31.839 --> 01:40:35.722]  And they kept selling this non-stop.
[01:40:36.123 --> 01:40:44.670]  And anyone that came out against it, they were branded just like they're branding people now that don't want to inoculate a tiny little
[01:40:45.310 --> 01:40:59.200]  Baby that comes out of the mother's womb after being in there for nine months and then shooting it up with his whole array of unknown toxins and saying it's okay.
[01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:00.381]  Yeah, where's the common sense?
[01:41:00.781 --> 01:41:02.462]  I mean, any idiot knows that's not smart.
[01:41:02.982 --> 01:41:05.164]  They did the same thing with estrogen.
[01:41:05.704 --> 01:41:13.770]  Then when they found out that it did everything to kill women that they said they were going to save them with,
[01:41:15.165 --> 01:41:17.727]  They hardly talked about it.
[01:41:18.948 --> 01:41:22.651]  I wrote about this in detail back in 2002.
[01:41:23.492 --> 01:41:27.035]  I remember when it all came out that estrogen had given millions of women cancer.
[01:41:27.776 --> 01:41:46.784]  Yes, and remember how those same little low-life people on NBC, CBS, ABC, the Cartoon News Network, CNN, went after everyone that said that these were dangerous to women's health.
[01:41:47.245 --> 01:41:52.307]  And then when they were proven to be dangerous, not a peep from the prostitutes.
[01:41:53.047 --> 01:41:58.729]  So again, the biggest story is, going back to the hacking, is it's a takeover.
[01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:01.511]  It's the top story in the Trends Journal.
[01:42:01.851 --> 01:42:03.471]  The grand manipulation.
[01:42:03.791 --> 01:42:11.895]  By the way, that's written by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, of course you know, on your show, former assistant treasury secretary to Ronald Reagan.
[01:42:12.395 --> 01:42:14.176]  This is a complete takeover.
[01:42:14.696 --> 01:42:16.337]  The government has been taken over.
[01:42:16.637 --> 01:42:18.478]  The multinationals are in charge.
[01:42:18.798 --> 01:42:20.518]  This is a conspiracy theory.
[01:42:20.879 --> 01:42:24.860]  Oh, how about that Trans-Pacific Partnership that nobody's talking about, huh?
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:26.061]  Isn't that a nice one?
[01:42:26.181 --> 01:42:29.262]  Well, that's what's frustrating is that it's all out in the open.
[01:42:29.622 --> 01:42:31.183]  They don't even hide it anymore.
[01:42:31.963 --> 01:42:34.465]  Because people... Smart phones?
[01:42:34.866 --> 01:42:36.547]  How about dumb phones?
[01:42:36.968 --> 01:42:47.017]  How about all this technology has made people even less connected because their minds are going into so many different directions that they're not paying attention to the facts?
[01:42:47.917 --> 01:42:51.400]  It's easy to manipulate the masses now more than ever.
[01:42:51.821 --> 01:42:57.546]  By the way, the French have just proven they're as stupid as Americans.
[01:42:57.986 --> 01:42:59.107]  And I can give you the proof.
[01:42:59.548 --> 01:43:01.469]  Go back to before 9-11.
[01:43:01.970 --> 01:43:03.671]  George Bush just gets elected.
[01:43:03.691 --> 01:43:05.573]  He's only in office, what, about eight months?
[01:43:05.913 --> 01:43:10.997]  His popularity is going below 50% after just getting elected.
[01:43:12.278 --> 01:43:13.159]  9-11 happens?
[01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:17.622]  Man, the imbecile-in-chief became a brilliant guy.
[01:43:17.642 --> 01:43:20.224]  Go look what happened over there in France.
[01:43:21.665 --> 01:43:24.567]  Hollande's popularity rating was 12%.
[01:43:26.869 --> 01:43:31.152]  Now, with that attack over there, it's pushing up over 50%.
[01:43:32.833 --> 01:43:38.217]  People buy propaganda really quickly, and now that they're in control of all
[01:43:38.257 --> 01:43:44.319]  All these different elements that wire us together, their power is even greater.
[01:43:44.679 --> 01:43:48.020]  And that's why they try to... Media matters.
[01:43:48.281 --> 01:43:49.661]  Media matters for this.
[01:43:49.961 --> 01:43:51.842]  They're a wasted organization.
[01:43:52.182 --> 01:44:00.365]  All they do is pump the Democratic BS baloney and attack anyone that attacks their little boys and girls.
[01:44:02.113 --> 01:44:05.857]  Gerald, I want to race through, because I promised to go to callers, they want to talk to you, they got questions.
[01:44:06.277 --> 01:44:13.064]  But race through some of the trends that are developing, because you've pretty accurately guessed what was coming up last year to this year.
[01:44:13.125 --> 01:44:14.526]  What else are you watching right now?
[01:44:14.546 --> 01:44:18.330]  All right, on the economic front, look at the volatility in the markets.
[01:44:18.851 --> 01:44:24.396]  Yesterday, crude was down, and West Texas, you know, five and a half, six percent.
[01:44:25.197 --> 01:44:26.458]  The day before was up.
[01:44:26.938 --> 01:44:29.419]  Now it's back up again five and a half, six percent.
[01:44:29.779 --> 01:44:30.700]  Look at the markets.
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:32.861]  The market will be up 250 points.
[01:44:33.261 --> 01:44:36.883]  All of a sudden, 20 minutes before closing, it's down.
[01:44:37.663 --> 01:44:47.568]  Day after day, the volatility in the markets, the equity markets worldwide since the beginning of this year, is like nothing I have ever seen before.
[01:44:47.848 --> 01:44:48.909]  It's out of control.
[01:44:48.929 --> 01:44:52.551]  Doesn't it speak to regging and hurts the average investor that helps the insiders?
[01:44:53.571 --> 01:44:54.513]  It's all rigged.
[01:44:54.653 --> 01:44:56.215]  Again, the grand manipulation.
[01:44:56.335 --> 01:44:59.959]  And one of the other stories in the Trends Journal is bankism.
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:01.782]  That's written by Nomi Prins.
[01:45:01.822 --> 01:45:05.066]  Of course, she wrote the book, All the President's Bankers.
[01:45:05.106 --> 01:45:07.088]  Goldman Sachs, former managing director.
[01:45:07.549 --> 01:45:07.769]  Right.
[01:45:08.150 --> 01:45:09.512]  Now, what do we have here?
[01:45:09.952 --> 01:45:11.394]  This is not capitalism.
[01:45:11.454 --> 01:45:13.137]  Everybody grow up about it.
[01:45:13.497 --> 01:45:14.599]  It's fascism.
[01:45:15.019 --> 01:45:19.005]  There is no such thing in capitalism as too big to fail.
[01:45:19.586 --> 01:45:24.774]  Bankism is the merger of state and corporate powers, and it's going on everywhere.
[01:45:25.034 --> 01:45:26.975]  You talked about the average investor.
[01:45:27.296 --> 01:45:29.277]  Here's how they're shafting all of us.
[01:45:29.737 --> 01:45:30.718]  They're doing it in Europe.
[01:45:30.738 --> 01:45:31.718]  They're doing it in China.
[01:45:31.739 --> 01:45:32.699]  They're doing it in Japan.
[01:45:32.939 --> 01:45:33.960]  They're doing it in the U.S.
[01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:37.442]  They're doing it everywhere with record low interest rates.
[01:45:37.722 --> 01:45:40.965]  They have not raised interest rates in the United States since 2006.
[01:45:42.546 --> 01:45:43.346]  What does that mean?
[01:45:43.706 --> 01:45:50.571]  It means they used to have a thing when we were young people that you put money in a bank and they had a thing called savings account.
[01:45:50.891 --> 01:45:52.152]  You get more money than you...
[01:45:54.974 --> 01:45:55.554]  Cheap money in the bank.
[01:45:55.995 --> 01:45:56.495]  That's right.
[01:45:56.515 --> 01:46:00.338]  They have negative interest rates now in Europe.
[01:46:00.358 --> 01:46:01.299]  0.25% to keep your money there.
[01:46:01.679 --> 01:46:12.468]  So now, what this has done is all this cheap money is going to the banks so they can loan it to us back at any rate that they can get as they're borrowing it at 0.25%.
[01:46:12.588 --> 01:46:19.054]  So they have these payday loans, 800%, credit card loans, what, 30%?
[01:46:19.134 --> 01:46:21.195]  They're getting it literally for free.
[01:46:21.876 --> 01:46:22.436]  Exactly.
[01:46:23.478 --> 01:46:25.642]  Now you look at the growth in the stock market.
[01:46:26.417 --> 01:46:37.224]  Half the growth in the stock market has come from companies buying back their stock because they are members of the too-big-to-fail club, the bankism club, and the grand manipulation club.
[01:46:37.484 --> 01:46:39.326]  They're the Davos boys and girls.
[01:46:39.706 --> 01:46:40.667]  And here's what they do.
[01:46:40.987 --> 01:46:48.612]  They borrow the money for almost nothing, they buy back their stock, they raise it up, and then they make all this dough because they're on the inside.
[01:46:48.972 --> 01:46:56.317]  The other money from the cheap rates has come from mergers and acquisitions because they too could borrow the money for almost nothing,
[01:46:56.777 --> 01:47:02.420]  Merger and acquisition activity in 2014 was back to 2007 levels.
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:05.381]  Now let's put it into perspective for all of us.
[01:47:06.362 --> 01:47:11.484]  Even these cheap interest rates have not been enough to boost the housing market.
[01:47:12.465 --> 01:47:15.106]  The only growth is coming from the top.
[01:47:17.334 --> 01:47:21.936]  40% of first-time homebuyers used to be people between 25 to 35.
[01:47:23.337 --> 01:47:25.917]  Now they can't afford to buy homes anymore.
[01:47:26.258 --> 01:47:28.018]  That number's down to 24, 26%.
[01:47:30.419 --> 01:47:38.202]  So the only deal this is doing, whether it was the new deal they just did over there in Europe with Mario Draghi,
[01:47:38.982 --> 01:47:48.126]  The guy who was the former head of the Goldman Sachs gang, the European division, that's now the head of the president of the European Central Bank.
[01:47:48.786 --> 01:47:52.808]  All of this quantitative easing is only enriching the rich.
[01:47:53.148 --> 01:47:54.429]  I'm not making this up.
[01:47:54.849 --> 01:47:55.690]  Here's the number.
[01:47:55.750 --> 01:47:56.390]  You know it.
[01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:58.291]  Oxfam came out with it.
[01:47:59.414 --> 01:48:06.861]  By next year, 1% of the people will have more dough than 99% of the rest of us.
[01:48:06.901 --> 01:48:08.742]  And that is a tiny percent of the 1%.
[01:48:08.903 --> 01:48:19.032]  They're then going to scapegoat Nouveau-Riche and upper middle class, and they're financing class warfare, Davos is, to sick the giant poor mass.
[01:48:19.432 --> 01:48:19.692]  Hello?
[01:48:40.442 --> 01:48:46.504]  Okay, I have a couple of quick cogent points, not necessarily... It's okay, go ahead.
[01:48:46.524 --> 01:48:47.925]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:48:48.165 --> 01:49:03.810]  Okay, as to the mandatory vaccination push that's going on now, I have an idea for actually being able to do something about it, and it's a hash-jacking campaign.
[01:49:04.811 --> 01:49:13.018]  Uh, every, uh, every post, every tweet, everything that goes out there should contain the hashtag, my body, my choice.
[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:20.263]  That way, uh, it, it co-ops that, uh, that popular meme.
[01:49:20.723 --> 01:49:21.304]  Absolutely.
[01:49:21.344 --> 01:49:22.545]  We should be hijacking this.
[01:49:22.585 --> 01:49:25.527]  Listen, I'm not trying to be mean, but we got Gerald for a limited time.
[01:49:25.547 --> 01:49:27.068]  I'm going to put you on hold and come back to you.
[01:49:27.729 --> 01:49:33.914]  These are calls for Gerald Celente on trends, and we don't really screen calls, but when a guest is on, my heavens,
[01:49:34.614 --> 01:49:44.021]  Just try to address it there, but I love the fact you're trying to take action, just that we'll get to you after Gerald goes, and I want to get into the whole vaccine thing then, so we'll hold you over until then.
[01:49:44.962 --> 01:49:47.844]  Matt in Idaho, first time caller on the air with Gerald Cilente.
[01:49:47.864 --> 01:49:53.708]  I called about the vaccination, so if you want to put me back on hold, that's fine.
[01:49:54.088 --> 01:50:00.093]  Okay, I don't know what's going on with the calls right now, but I was saying to the callers on air, this is just, clear the board.
[01:50:00.733 --> 01:50:02.395]  Shut the board down, clear it.
[01:50:03.268 --> 01:50:03.948]  We'll have to do that.
[01:50:04.409 --> 01:50:06.210]  For the folks up at GCN, they're taking the calls.
[01:50:06.530 --> 01:50:12.053]  We're taking calls for Gerald Salente.
[01:50:12.073 --> 01:50:12.113]  800-259-9231.
[01:50:12.133 --> 01:50:12.293]  800-259-9231.
[01:50:12.373 --> 01:50:17.016]  And listen, I'm not mad.
[01:50:17.136 --> 01:50:18.496]  I'm not criticizing anybody.
[01:50:19.377 --> 01:50:20.057]  I love our listeners.
[01:50:20.097 --> 01:50:20.698]  I love our callers.
[01:50:21.078 --> 01:50:24.440]  We have the most open call system in the world for talk radio.
[01:50:25.117 --> 01:50:27.138]  We don't try to control what you say.
[01:50:27.178 --> 01:50:28.319]  We don't censor what you say.
[01:50:28.659 --> 01:50:36.544]  But when we say we're on a topic, it's next hour that I was going to open the phones up so people got confused on your vaccine stories.
[01:50:36.624 --> 01:50:37.725]  Are you for vaccines?
[01:50:38.025 --> 01:50:38.765]  Are you against them?
[01:50:38.785 --> 01:50:39.906]  Have you had good results?
[01:50:39.946 --> 01:50:40.887]  Have you had bad results?
[01:50:41.667 --> 01:50:42.907]  That's what I did yesterday.
[01:50:43.127 --> 01:50:44.428]  Nobody called in supporting him.
[01:50:44.888 --> 01:50:46.148]  All we got was horror stories.
[01:50:46.448 --> 01:50:50.630]  So I want to hear from you again after Gerald leaves us at five after or so.
[01:50:51.010 --> 01:50:53.070]  But I do want to take a few calls for Gerald.
[01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:57.411]  Folks were always calling us wanting us to get him on or ask Gerald this, ask Gerald that.
[01:50:57.751 --> 01:51:02.713]  We will come back and take some quick questions for Gerald Celente and get a few more trends with him.
[01:51:03.153 --> 01:51:05.914]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.

[01:52:12.997 --> 01:52:15.959]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere.
[01:52:16.299 --> 01:52:21.263]  Because we're faced with more diseases than ever before, we need a better solution than ever before.
[01:52:21.703 --> 01:52:24.846]  Fortunately, there is a simple, effective way to protect yourself.

[01:53:11.263 --> 01:53:16.605]  And now, this winter has been the worst on record when it comes to our immune systems and health.
[01:53:16.825 --> 01:53:25.929]  For more than two years, InfoWarsLife.com has been watching this crisis intensify, and Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Complex was our answer.
[01:53:26.249 --> 01:53:31.752]  Using a proprietary process that takes ancient proven herbs and combines them with modern science.
[01:53:32.032 --> 01:53:44.459]  This powerful and affordable formula contains more than 14 key herbs and extracts including Echinacea, Ginger Root, Elderberry, Golden Seal Root, a proprietary Yin-Chio formula, and many, many more.
[01:53:44.739 --> 01:53:46.200]  I take it and so does my family.

[01:53:47.881 --> 01:53:52.143]  Gluten-free, alcohol-free, no artificial flavors or colors, and not tested on animals.
[01:53:52.583 --> 01:53:55.305]  Take advantage of this introductory offer for Ancient Defense.

[01:54:19.545 --> 01:54:25.568]  I'm going to Mike here in a moment, listening on KSCO there in Santa Cruz, San Francisco.
[01:54:26.908 --> 01:54:29.330]  Gerald Cilente is our guest.
[01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:32.351]  The website is TrendsResearch.com.
[01:54:32.511 --> 01:54:36.653]  We're going to keep Gerald a little bit into the next hour to get into a few more of his trends.
[01:54:36.673 --> 01:54:38.414]  Then I'm going to open the phones up on vaccines.
[01:54:38.994 --> 01:54:40.455]  So I'm sorry if I wasn't clear with the listeners.
[01:54:40.475 --> 01:54:41.996]  We're talking to Gerald Cilente right now.
[01:54:42.016 --> 01:54:43.536]  We've got a loaded phone bank.
[01:54:43.616 --> 01:54:44.417]  Folks want to talk to him.
[01:54:45.157 --> 01:54:46.658]  So Mike in California.
[01:54:47.378 --> 01:54:49.439]  Listening on the great Michael's Whirling Station.
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:50.520]  Go ahead.
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:51.020]  Good morning.
[01:54:51.541 --> 01:54:51.761]  Welcome.
[01:54:51.781 --> 01:54:52.881]  I'm glad Gerald's on.
[01:54:52.921 --> 01:54:54.022]  Always glad to hear Gerald.
[01:54:54.082 --> 01:54:56.143]  Hey, I have a question for you on real estate.
[01:54:56.604 --> 01:55:06.930]  In 2008, we invested in tangible assets, a significant amount, to shelter our savings from the devaluation cycle.
[01:55:07.710 --> 01:55:09.391]  My wife's been looking at real estate.
[01:55:11.284 --> 01:55:22.044]  And I just want Gerald to comment on what he thinks about real estate as an investment for those that have a limited amount of resources shielded in tangible assets.
[01:55:23.106 --> 01:55:25.267]  Well, you know, I don't give financial advice.
[01:55:25.307 --> 01:55:27.287]  I'm not permitted to as a trend forecaster.
[01:55:27.327 --> 01:55:28.708]  I'm not a financial advisor.
[01:55:28.828 --> 01:55:30.328]  Only speaking for myself.
[01:55:31.228 --> 01:55:39.951]  If you have a piece of real estate, you think it's going to be profitable, and you're smart enough to understand the negatives and positives about it.
[01:55:40.551 --> 01:55:41.991]  To me, it's a good investment.
[01:55:42.492 --> 01:55:45.793]  You know, again, but not to do it on a speculative level.
[01:55:45.873 --> 01:55:49.474]  Like you said, you doubled down on America and bought a bunch of real estate as well.
[01:55:49.514 --> 01:55:50.394]  You're not backing down.
[01:55:50.996 --> 01:55:55.182]  No, I bought a 1750s building, a 1763, and a 1774.
[01:55:55.562 --> 01:56:03.352]  You know, so I bought it, it's out of passion and out of an understanding that these things aren't going to look out of place.
[01:56:03.372 --> 01:56:05.275]  It's a love of art and culture, you literally bought into 1776.
[01:56:07.145 --> 01:56:10.348]  Yes, and I did because I'm an American.
[01:56:10.928 --> 01:56:14.631]  And as I say, my blood is Italian, but my heart's American.
[01:56:15.052 --> 01:56:17.934]  And these people that say, love it or leave it, I say, no, you leave it.
[01:56:18.335 --> 01:56:25.301]  I bought these buildings because I want to restore America back to the core principles of our founding fathers.
[01:56:25.941 --> 01:56:28.584]  So that's why I invest in this.
[01:56:29.184 --> 01:56:36.670]  But for the caller, if you think it's a good investment, real estate goes like this, but it always keeps going higher.
[01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:45.397]  So if it's something that you're doing out of wisdom of what the potential is, I would suggest you consider it seriously.
[01:56:45.677 --> 01:56:49.604]  You make a good buy, it's in the right area, and you understand you're in a long-term deal.
[01:56:49.964 --> 01:56:55.353]  And if it's a piece of property you can make some money on with a business while it's there, I think that's the best type of investment.
[01:56:55.714 --> 01:56:56.275]  Exactly.
[01:56:56.295 --> 01:56:56.956]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:56:57.016 --> 01:56:59.179]  Not for speculation, but for growth.
[01:57:00.233 --> 01:57:04.578]  Yeah, well, I guess the consideration is, you know, to know what is a bubble market.
[01:57:04.678 --> 01:57:06.780]  I mean, you know, somebody's priced.
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:13.287]  You know, you can't tell because I talked before about the volatility in the markets.
[01:57:13.307 --> 01:57:17.811]  I also talked about how these low interest rates are not driving demand.
[01:57:18.332 --> 01:57:19.914]  So you have to make your own choice.
[01:57:19.934 --> 01:57:22.757]  Because I believe we're going to see a crash.
[01:57:24.558 --> 01:57:27.720]  I agree, the Austin bubble's already popping, the biggest in the country.
[01:57:28.020 --> 01:57:29.361]  Aaron in California, thanks Mike.
[01:57:29.641 --> 01:57:33.343]  Aaron in California, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:57:33.363 --> 01:57:34.463]  Yes, thank you very much.
[01:57:35.424 --> 01:57:44.269]  Mr. Celente, you for years were the top trends forecaster, but you made some predictions for 2014.
[01:57:44.529 --> 01:57:46.610]  You said gold 2000,
[01:57:48.485 --> 01:57:50.266]  And a financial collapse by March 2014.
[01:57:50.346 --> 01:57:51.848]  That did not happen.
[01:57:51.868 --> 01:57:54.129]  You were dethroned as top trends forecast.
[01:57:54.209 --> 01:57:54.830]  That's the facts.
[01:57:54.850 --> 01:57:55.630]  It's all in records.
[01:58:03.716 --> 01:58:05.557]  I never said gold would go to $2,000.
[01:58:06.457 --> 01:58:08.898]  I said I believe gold should be over $2,000.
[01:58:09.938 --> 01:58:11.218]  I never said it would go there.
[01:58:11.618 --> 01:58:18.820]  On the crash, I believe that the Federal Reserve was going to raise interest rates by March.
[01:58:19.601 --> 01:58:20.361]  I was wrong.
[01:58:21.301 --> 01:58:26.963]  I never dreamt that they would keep interest rates at, again, they haven't raised them since 2006.
[01:58:27.043 --> 01:58:27.243]  Yeah.
[01:58:27.303 --> 01:58:29.623]  This is unprecedented.
[01:58:29.663 --> 01:58:32.904]  It's like somebody dying and they keep giving them adrenaline until their parents get there.
[01:58:32.944 --> 01:58:34.284]  I've actually gone and seen my friend die.
[01:58:34.304 --> 01:58:36.785]  I mean, they were waiting on his dad to get there, so they were giving him adrenaline.
[01:58:37.085 --> 01:58:40.306]  He got to see his parents, everybody, and then he passed out and died.
[01:58:40.426 --> 01:58:41.406]  I mean, that's America.
[01:58:41.426 --> 01:58:46.288]  There's pumping adrenaline in to keep us alive, but, you know, it's gonna crash.
[01:58:46.388 --> 01:58:47.488]  All the experts are saying that.
[01:58:47.728 --> 01:58:48.368]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:48.568 --> 01:58:50.049]  Gerald's been proven accurate.
[01:58:50.069 --> 01:58:51.290]  I want to be able to elaborate on that.
[01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:54.031]  I mean, look at what Trump's saying.
[01:58:54.191 --> 01:58:56.833]  It's the fundamentals show a crash, okay?
[01:58:56.853 --> 01:58:57.893]  When it comes, we don't know.
[01:58:59.374 --> 01:59:02.375]  Year after year, we watched the threat steadily increase.
[01:59:02.656 --> 01:59:08.018]  And now, this winter has been the worst on record when it comes to our immune systems and health.

[02:00:24.311 --> 02:00:25.052]  It is Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.072 --> 02:00:26.613]  From the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.633 --> 02:00:28.033]  TrendsResearch.com, Gerald's side.
[02:00:28.073 --> 02:00:30.194]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.254 --> 02:00:35.237]  I want to get to Aaron and Kyle and Rob and Adam and Joe and everybody else.
[02:00:35.617 --> 02:00:36.557]  I know Gerald's a big boy.
[02:00:36.577 --> 02:00:37.418]  He can defend himself.
[02:00:37.458 --> 02:00:39.219]  He has made a lot of accurate predictions since 1980.
[02:00:39.259 --> 02:00:40.599]  Written best-selling books.
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:46.221]  Most experts have been saying it's untenable.
[02:00:46.841 --> 02:00:49.382]  The Fed had said they were going to stop doing QE3.
[02:00:49.402 --> 02:00:52.083]  A lot of people I talked to said they have to.
[02:00:52.703 --> 02:00:56.044]  In fact, Kaiser predicted that the bond market would go crazy.
[02:00:56.404 --> 02:01:01.406]  It kind of did, but the point is things have gotten so artificial with the rigging, it's just going and going.
[02:01:03.311 --> 02:01:04.532]  Governments are digging in.
[02:01:04.812 --> 02:01:06.854]  The Pentagon says they believe a big crash is coming.
[02:01:06.874 --> 02:01:14.620]  I mean, Gerald's pretty mainstream now when it comes to actual financial analysts saying, I mean, some type of big collapse is coming.
[02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:15.761]  Look at the collapse in Europe.
[02:01:15.781 --> 02:01:17.142]  Look at collapses in other areas.
[02:01:17.562 --> 02:01:20.345]  But I want Aaron to be able to come back at Gerald
[02:01:21.513 --> 02:01:24.955]  I mean, look, I don't care if you call in, Aaron, and disagree with Gerald and say you're wrong.
[02:01:25.395 --> 02:01:26.416]  I can just hear your voice.
[02:01:26.436 --> 02:01:29.958]  You really enjoy saying you have been dethroned and all this.
[02:01:30.338 --> 02:01:31.559]  Look, I hope Gerald's wrong.
[02:01:31.599 --> 02:01:32.359]  I hope I'm wrong.
[02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:34.761]  I hope all these other financial analysts are wrong.
[02:01:35.181 --> 02:01:38.563]  You know, I hope... But that's not what the elites are doing.
[02:01:38.603 --> 02:01:41.105]  They're all buying emergency getaways around the world.
[02:01:41.125 --> 02:01:42.145]  That was in the London Guardian.
[02:01:42.645 --> 02:01:46.368]  So I talk to billionaires and insiders and they are scared you-know-what.
[02:01:47.068 --> 02:01:48.389]  So, I mean, what do you say to that, Aaron?
[02:01:50.699 --> 02:01:52.781]  Okay, you got me on my back, but you asked me a question.
[02:01:52.821 --> 02:01:53.341]  Here's the thing.
[02:01:53.361 --> 02:01:58.485]  Uh-uh, Gerald Flint did not come up or coin the term bankism.
[02:01:58.505 --> 02:02:01.787]  That's another thing, and I can back up those first two allegations.
[02:02:01.887 --> 02:02:03.969]  Alright, you got an audio problem.
[02:02:03.989 --> 02:02:04.329]  Hold on.
[02:02:04.349 --> 02:02:07.411]  And now you're going to say he didn't found the term bankism.
[02:02:07.431 --> 02:02:08.612]  He founded prostitutes.
[02:02:08.932 --> 02:02:10.614]  This is a bunch of territorial nitpicking.
[02:02:10.934 --> 02:02:12.175]  Gerald, you want to respond to this guy?
[02:02:12.748 --> 02:02:17.630]  Yeah, well, first I know this guy as he keeps sending me very nasty emails all the time.
[02:02:17.650 --> 02:02:19.071]  Alright, let him go then.
[02:02:19.111 --> 02:02:20.471]  Yeah, here's the deal.
[02:02:20.652 --> 02:02:22.452]  I never said gold was going to go to $2,000.
[02:02:22.492 --> 02:02:27.615]  You said it should be on this show, but they've rigged the market.
[02:02:27.975 --> 02:02:29.736]  Right, I never said it would hit it.
[02:02:30.116 --> 02:02:31.436]  I said it should be at it.
[02:02:32.197 --> 02:02:32.797]  And over.
[02:02:33.197 --> 02:02:34.778]  I've said this over and over again.
[02:02:34.798 --> 02:02:36.219]  I never gave a date.
[02:02:36.599 --> 02:02:38.660]  Number two on the rates.
[02:02:39.620 --> 02:02:42.422]  The Federal Reserve should be raising rates.
[02:02:43.262 --> 02:02:44.523]  Everybody knows it.
[02:02:44.943 --> 02:02:49.145]  And when they try to do it, you can see panic in the marketplace.
[02:02:49.906 --> 02:02:57.230]  I had believed last year that by March, or a year and a half ago, they would have to raise rates.
[02:02:57.330 --> 02:02:57.870]  They didn't.
[02:02:58.571 --> 02:02:59.491]  They kept them low.
[02:02:59.972 --> 02:03:02.833]  When rates go up, the economy goes down.
[02:03:03.233 --> 02:03:03.954]  Here's a fact.
[02:03:05.063 --> 02:03:06.644]  Go around the world.
[02:03:07.504 --> 02:03:13.028]  Every government virtually now is dropping rates to all-time lows.
[02:03:14.368 --> 02:03:15.149]  Australia.
[02:03:16.687 --> 02:03:17.928]  Go throughout Europe.
[02:03:17.988 --> 02:03:22.790]  Europe just joined the QE, which says inflation, but then they're also deflating with the Saudis.
[02:03:23.071 --> 02:03:24.852]  Is there a strategy there to try to balance that?
[02:03:25.392 --> 02:03:29.194]  What this is, by the way, that's... I'm glad you brought up this deflation thing.
[02:03:29.634 --> 02:03:32.196]  Here's the big lie that they're telling people.
[02:03:32.876 --> 02:03:38.119]  They have to deal with deflation and bring it up to inflation.
[02:03:38.359 --> 02:03:40.260]  Here's what they're selling the public.
[02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:43.642]  Matter of fact, Brian Williams could pull this one off.
[02:03:44.122 --> 02:03:45.003]  Here's what they say.
[02:03:46.158 --> 02:03:58.504]  Deflation is dangerous because if people know that prices are going to go down, that means they're going to wait to buy things knowing that the prices are going to go down.
[02:03:59.084 --> 02:04:00.404]  That's a lot of baloney.
[02:04:01.185 --> 02:04:03.166]  Deflation is a depression.
[02:04:03.806 --> 02:04:10.130]  Prices are going down because there's too much supply and not enough demand.
[02:04:10.210 --> 02:04:10.510]  Sure.
[02:04:10.590 --> 02:04:13.672]  It's not only oil prices that are down.
[02:04:14.172 --> 02:04:26.539]  Copper prices, iron ore, nickel, one commodity after another is down to five and a half and six year lows because demand is off.
[02:04:26.979 --> 02:04:31.862]  Go and look what happened and the hype that no one's talking about now
[02:04:32.262 --> 02:04:35.767]  Look at the numbers that came out from December retail sales.
[02:04:36.227 --> 02:04:37.288]  Oh, they were down!
[02:04:37.629 --> 02:04:39.171]  They were supposed to go up!
[02:04:39.792 --> 02:04:40.993]  Why were they down?
[02:04:41.353 --> 02:04:44.137]  Remember the big sales before Christmas?
[02:04:44.157 --> 02:04:44.738]  50 to 70% off?
[02:04:47.581 --> 02:04:50.303]  Look who just declared bankruptcy!
[02:04:50.723 --> 02:04:52.084]  Cachet yesterday.
[02:04:52.444 --> 02:04:54.906]  How many other companies... JCPenney's closing a bunch of stores.
[02:04:54.926 --> 02:04:55.246]  Stay there.
[02:04:55.486 --> 02:05:01.930]  Yeah, and we're not happy that things are bad, but every real fundamental, 100 million out of the workforce, 50 million on food stamps.
[02:05:02.410 --> 02:05:04.892]  I mean, this guy's saying you're wrong, saying we're in financial trouble.
[02:05:04.932 --> 02:05:05.893]  We are collapsing.
[02:05:06.493 --> 02:05:07.854]  But they give us a sugar high.
[02:05:09.266 --> 02:05:16.210]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[02:06:03.897 --> 02:06:04.237]  Silver Bullet.
[02:06:09.366 --> 02:06:12.867]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:06:13.027 --> 02:06:16.988]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:06:17.289 --> 02:06:18.749]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:06:19.069 --> 02:06:26.651]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[02:06:38.933 --> 02:06:42.154]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[02:08:24.081 --> 02:08:27.423]  It's the time of the season.
[02:08:27.924 --> 02:08:31.526]  When love runs high.
[02:08:32.327 --> 02:08:35.749]  In this time, give it to me easy.
[02:08:37.791 --> 02:08:42.895]  And let me try with pleasured hands to take you in.
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:09:00.887]  If you tune into CNBC, they say private mega-central banks control the world with free money that they issue to themselves.
[02:09:01.747 --> 02:09:11.017]  World governments being established, they want a hundred trillion dollars every decade paid through basically the Davos Group to George Soros and the Goldman Sachs gang and the rest of the crew.
[02:09:13.536 --> 02:09:17.118]  We know, I mean, it's just all over the place now.
[02:09:17.478 --> 02:09:20.019]  Gerald was saying it five years ago, ten years ago, I was saying it.
[02:09:20.379 --> 02:09:27.042]  You could see where trillions in debt was going, thousands of trillions in derivatives, all this garbage.
[02:09:27.082 --> 02:09:28.983]  You know there's going to be some type of collapse.
[02:09:29.363 --> 02:09:30.504]  Governments are digging in.
[02:09:31.024 --> 02:09:37.587]  Gerald had said last year, or about two years ago that he believed 2014 could be the time for this, that QE had to end.
[02:09:38.127 --> 02:09:39.048]  It's still going.
[02:09:39.108 --> 02:09:40.268]  Now there's a world race.
[02:09:40.328 --> 02:09:41.509]  So will it be inflation?
[02:09:42.748 --> 02:09:43.609]  Or deflationary.
[02:09:43.649 --> 02:09:45.411]  The Saudis aren't just trying to bankrupt U.S.
[02:09:45.451 --> 02:09:47.154]  shale producers or the Russians.
[02:09:47.834 --> 02:10:00.070]  I believe they're introducing depressionary prices to actually attempt to pull down the inflationary spike that we see in this Weimar money printing.
[02:10:01.144 --> 02:10:13.851]  But regardless, it's a juggling act as the real economy dies, as savings go down, as joblessness increases, as wages go down, as 40-something million people went from full-time to part-time under Obamacare, as that kicks in.
[02:10:14.781 --> 02:10:20.527]  And as Obama's energy policies kick in, I don't see how the economy won't implode.
[02:10:20.967 --> 02:10:23.329]  And now most analysts are just saying it's any minute.
[02:10:23.870 --> 02:10:28.374]  But who knows, in this Alice in Wonderland thing, Gerald, when do you, I mean, how long can this go?
[02:10:28.414 --> 02:10:32.118]  I mean, we've got all these big top guys saying it's gonna, you know, get out of the market.
[02:10:32.478 --> 02:10:33.459]  Doom's about to happen.
[02:10:33.499 --> 02:10:33.980]  What do you think?
[02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:37.642]  Again, the volatility is telling the story.
[02:10:37.762 --> 02:10:45.585]  And by the way, these low oil prices, if you go back to 1986, that's one of the ways I made my name as a trend forecaster.
[02:10:45.605 --> 02:10:47.106]  It was in the Wall Street Journal.
[02:10:47.626 --> 02:10:49.707]  I had predicted that the crash of 87.
[02:10:50.908 --> 02:10:53.989]  In the beginning of the year, in January, I said the market was going to crash.
[02:10:54.489 --> 02:10:57.830]  And one of the fundamentals were crashing oil prices.
[02:10:58.410 --> 02:11:00.771]  Yes, the Saudis want to get rid of competition.
[02:11:01.111 --> 02:11:06.673]  But again, as I mentioned before, you look at the commodity prices around the world.
[02:11:07.133 --> 02:11:15.136]  You can buy a ton of reinforcement rod, rebar, in China cheaper than you can a ton of cabbage.
[02:11:16.016 --> 02:11:17.919]  There's so much product on the market.
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:24.169]  You go to any store now and you're seeing slash prices of you name the product.
[02:11:24.649 --> 02:11:27.253]  Now on the cut on the inflation.
[02:11:28.379 --> 02:11:31.041]  Yes, it's a Weimar type of inflation.
[02:11:31.462 --> 02:11:37.807]  It's not as though in supply and demand, where there's so much demand that the price of the product is going up.
[02:11:38.227 --> 02:11:45.994]  What they're doing around the world is devaluing their currencies, so it's going to cause people more to buy things.
[02:11:46.374 --> 02:11:49.436]  For example, you look what's going on in Europe.
[02:11:50.217 --> 02:12:01.445]  Now that Draghi announced, and they knew that they were going to announce their version of QE, what has happened to the euro?
[02:12:01.746 --> 02:12:03.007]  Oh, it's at 11-year lows.
[02:12:03.707 --> 02:12:04.528]  No, no kidding.
[02:12:04.808 --> 02:12:08.551]  So now it's costing all the people more money to buy things.
[02:12:10.092 --> 02:12:12.713]  40% of young people are unemployed in places like Spain.
[02:12:13.053 --> 02:12:14.774]  We're in a global depression.
[02:12:15.194 --> 02:12:19.056]  They're just papering it over because production's been so high traditionally.
[02:12:19.336 --> 02:12:23.578]  We've got a lot of baubles and still have food, but even that is starting to wear thin.
[02:12:24.238 --> 02:12:27.000]  They're papering it over with the word deflation.
[02:12:27.341 --> 02:12:28.321]  It's depression.
[02:12:28.782 --> 02:12:30.163]  It's not deflation.
[02:12:30.663 --> 02:12:31.704]  And that's the big loss.
[02:12:31.724 --> 02:12:31.964]  That's right.
[02:12:32.004 --> 02:12:33.726]  Oil prices went down during the Great Depression.
[02:12:33.746 --> 02:12:34.386]  That's what happens.
[02:12:34.847 --> 02:12:35.467]  Exactly.
[02:12:35.627 --> 02:12:37.389]  All the prices are going down.
[02:12:37.649 --> 02:12:42.152]  But people are making less and their currencies are being devalued.
[02:12:42.533 --> 02:12:49.899]  Just like Franklin Roosevelt devalued our currency when they took us off the gold
[02:12:50.419 --> 02:12:53.622]  Reserve and remember the dollar was pegged to gold.
[02:12:53.682 --> 02:12:55.384]  What was it at?
[02:12:55.404 --> 02:12:57.125]  $20 and something cents an ounce.
[02:12:57.786 --> 02:12:59.127]  And then gold went up after that.
[02:12:59.667 --> 02:13:10.637]  They called in all the gold and then they re-pegged the price of gold to $35 an ounce, which means you just lost 70% of your purchasing power.
[02:13:10.957 --> 02:13:12.479]  It's called a depression.
[02:13:12.819 --> 02:13:17.621]  You go around the world, I was mentioning, at the record low interest rates you're seeing.
[02:13:18.081 --> 02:13:25.344]  It's costing everybody more to buy things, but what they're doing is they're juicing the equity markets.
[02:13:25.865 --> 02:13:34.528]  In anticipation of Draghi's QE, now you're looking at the European markets at seven-year highs.
[02:13:34.548 --> 02:13:35.369]  Well, here's an example.
[02:13:35.409 --> 02:13:40.371]  They had Gibbs, when he was press secretary, say there is no drone program when it was a public program.
[02:13:40.751 --> 02:13:41.371]  That's the same thing.
[02:13:41.411 --> 02:13:44.433]  There is no depression forming when there is one.
[02:13:44.493 --> 02:13:55.941]  I mean, it's this game of, I'll never forget, they had, whoever that blonde was, Perino or whatever her name is, as the press secretary, and they were asking her under Bush, you know,
[02:13:57.001 --> 02:14:01.403]  Our oil price is up because the dollar's been devalued, and she said, I can't, you know, answer that.
[02:14:01.423 --> 02:14:07.005]  And they said, well, we need you to tell us if there's dollar devaluation, as if, tell us if the sun came out this morning.
[02:14:08.065 --> 02:14:09.626]  It's just total mind control.
[02:14:09.666 --> 02:14:10.886]  I want to go to some more calls here.
[02:14:10.906 --> 02:14:12.787]  I mean, I wish Gerald was wrong.
[02:14:12.827 --> 02:14:13.527]  I wish I was wrong.
[02:14:13.587 --> 02:14:15.408]  I wish we weren't going into a depression.
[02:14:15.768 --> 02:14:17.188]  But all the indicators are there.
[02:14:17.588 --> 02:14:20.709]  I don't know exactly how it's going to go down, but it's going down.
[02:14:21.650 --> 02:14:23.310]  Let's talk to Kyle in PA.
[02:14:23.370 --> 02:14:24.731]  Thanks for holding her on the air with Gerald.
[02:14:26.633 --> 02:14:33.116]  Hey guys, historically speaking, the collapse always happens in the last year of a sitting presidential term.
[02:14:34.397 --> 02:14:42.441]  And historically speaking, the collapse is always dramatically larger than the one previously to it.
[02:14:43.082 --> 02:14:51.086]  My question for Gerald is, what does American life look like in a collapse of the size that we're looking at right now?
[02:14:51.106 --> 02:14:51.646]  That's a great question.
[02:14:51.666 --> 02:14:52.487]  That's a great question.
[02:14:53.544 --> 02:14:58.548]  You know, I have a saying, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[02:14:59.348 --> 02:15:01.110]  And they're losing it around the world.
[02:15:01.790 --> 02:15:04.052]  But we don't have to have it happen like that.
[02:15:04.893 --> 02:15:17.683]  You know, the elections are coming up, and no one's really excited that I know of who the potential candidates are, choosing from the bloods of the crypts, or as people prefer to call them, the Republicans and Democrats.
[02:15:17.723 --> 02:15:20.265]  To me, they're murderers and thieves, their records prove it.
[02:15:20.905 --> 02:15:23.126]  Again, look what's going on around the world.
[02:15:23.826 --> 02:15:34.408]  Out of nowhere, out of nowhere, in less than a year, the Podemos party, they just had a rally over 300,000 people turned out in Spain.
[02:15:35.188 --> 02:15:36.789]  In Greece, the Syriza party.
[02:15:37.269 --> 02:15:40.070]  In Italy, between the Five Star Movement and the Northern League.
[02:15:40.450 --> 02:15:41.850]  In the UK, with UKIP.
[02:15:42.290 --> 02:15:45.914]  You're seeing it, like them or not, dislike them, I'm not getting into that.
[02:15:46.275 --> 02:15:53.584]  What I'm saying is whether it's Le Pen in France, you name the country... Yeah, it's right-wing, it's liberal, it's socialist.
[02:15:54.024 --> 02:15:59.971]  Everywhere people are electing quote radical anti-globalist, anti-New World Order, anti-EU parties.
[02:16:00.592 --> 02:16:09.122]  So what I'm saying is, to prevent what we can see coming, and to see chaos in the streets because, hey, they just did it in New York!
[02:16:09.483 --> 02:16:12.507]  Now they got terror response groups!
[02:16:12.907 --> 02:16:15.130]  We've seen the militarization of the police!
[02:16:15.150 --> 02:16:18.254]  Yeah, notice the terror response groups are for protesters now.
[02:16:18.734 --> 02:16:19.535]  Yeah, they said it!
[02:16:20.496 --> 02:16:21.096]  Exactly.
[02:16:21.477 --> 02:16:28.621]  So what I'm saying is they're putting these things into place because they know that people have nothing to lose and they're going to lose it.
[02:16:28.941 --> 02:16:32.663]  What we're suggesting is, let's take a different tact.
[02:16:33.344 --> 02:16:35.985]  Now, to me, is the time for a new third party.
[02:16:36.546 --> 02:16:40.648]  By the way, that's the other way I made my name in my book, Trend Tracking, that I wrote in 1988.
[02:16:42.489 --> 02:16:43.150]  Exactly.
[02:16:43.710 --> 02:16:48.594]  Now the conditions exist better than any time for a new third party.
[02:16:48.614 --> 02:16:48.914]  I agree.
[02:16:48.934 --> 02:16:53.417]  That's why they don't like Rand Paul and people that kind of represent a third party movement within the system.
[02:16:53.517 --> 02:16:58.281]  I think he is being too political and acting like he's establishment.
[02:16:58.501 --> 02:17:02.964]  They're never going to let him in acting like that because they know he's a good guy.
[02:17:02.984 --> 02:17:05.025]  I want to go to some more phone calls here.
[02:17:05.045 --> 02:17:05.646]  Thank you, Kyle.
[02:17:05.706 --> 02:17:06.386]  Great question.
[02:17:06.426 --> 02:17:06.987]  Great caller.
[02:17:07.707 --> 02:17:08.628]  Adam in Canada.
[02:17:08.648 --> 02:17:09.148]  You're on the air.
[02:17:09.188 --> 02:17:09.529]  Go ahead.
[02:17:10.928 --> 02:17:11.929]  Hi Alex, hi Gerald.
[02:17:12.329 --> 02:17:16.751]  First off, I just want to say God bless you guys as well as all your listeners and everyone throughout the world.
[02:17:16.811 --> 02:17:19.292]  I know this is an important cause and highly relevant.
[02:17:19.312 --> 02:17:22.274]  I've been a listener for a couple years waking up.
[02:17:22.354 --> 02:17:24.135]  Quick question for you, your crew and
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:25.481]  Yeah, I am.
[02:17:41.784 --> 02:17:42.105]  I am.
[02:17:42.405 --> 02:17:44.988]  There is a lawsuit, and it does appear legit.
[02:17:45.649 --> 02:17:47.631]  And it can really make a difference.
[02:17:48.272 --> 02:17:52.977]  Yeah, because lawsuits get discovery, and then that's how so many of these documents come out.
[02:17:53.157 --> 02:17:56.241]  As you know, Gerald, recently it's just coming out that basically everything's rigged.
[02:17:57.031 --> 02:18:04.336]  Yeah, but that lawsuit is gaining popularity and it's something worth looking into.
[02:18:04.356 --> 02:18:04.837]  I'll look into it.
[02:18:04.857 --> 02:18:06.818]  And it can be the beginning of a change.
[02:18:07.478 --> 02:18:19.707]  And again, going back to the whole question of what's going on, that people have to understand that it is bankism, it is the grand manipulation.
[02:18:19.727 --> 02:18:20.408]  Corporatism.
[02:18:21.288 --> 02:18:34.213]  It's total multinational takeover and between the Europeans, again going back to Europe, they are fighting their deal with the Transatlantic Investment Partnership, whatever they're calling it.
[02:18:34.873 --> 02:18:37.134]  It's not going to happen coming out of Europe.
[02:18:37.394 --> 02:18:39.375]  It's hardly being reported here.
[02:18:39.635 --> 02:18:41.516]  And I just want to take this second
[02:18:42.324 --> 02:18:43.065]  Or this minute.
[02:18:43.485 --> 02:18:58.257]  To thank you, Alex, for what you're doing to wake people up, the crew that you have, the information that you're putting out, and that everybody out there listening to support the people that are advertising on the show.
[02:18:58.698 --> 02:19:06.704]  These are products and services that are proven, that are natural, that are for the benefit of everyone that buys them.
[02:19:07.325 --> 02:19:10.187]  And it's the same thing what we're putting out with the Trends Journal.
[02:19:10.207 --> 02:19:10.748]  Thank you, Gerald.
[02:19:11.388 --> 02:19:12.529]  Tell folks about the Trends Journal.
[02:19:12.549 --> 02:19:13.871]  Let's keep you one more segment if you can do it.
[02:19:13.911 --> 02:19:17.174]  Just five more minutes after this to finish some calls, or six more minutes after this break.
[02:19:17.195 --> 02:19:23.742]  But tell folks about Trends Research, how they can get the magazine, because even if people think they know all this, it's great to give friends and family.
[02:19:25.304 --> 02:19:26.965]  It's TrendsJournal.com.
[02:19:27.065 --> 02:19:31.987]  We just had a conference here at the beginning of the year of the top trends of 2015.
[02:19:32.447 --> 02:19:35.748]  It's been a blockbuster, a five and a half hour conference.
[02:19:36.468 --> 02:19:41.050]  You see from that what we were saying, what's happening, and where it's going.
[02:19:41.390 --> 02:19:42.790]  Again, here are the facts.
[02:19:43.331 --> 02:19:44.311]  The facts are this.
[02:19:44.731 --> 02:19:48.032]  You look at the declining wages in this country, it's a fact.
[02:19:48.412 --> 02:19:51.253]  You look at median household income below 1999 levels, it's a fact.
[02:19:53.394 --> 02:19:56.416]  And as I was mentioning, you look at QE.
[02:19:56.656 --> 02:19:57.416]  Here's the deal.
[02:19:57.656 --> 02:20:03.239]  When they started QE in 2009, the markets went from 8,000 to 18,000.
[02:20:03.839 --> 02:20:07.341]  Who did it benefit as everyone else?
[02:20:07.361 --> 02:20:08.281]  That's right, the insiders.
[02:20:08.321 --> 02:20:09.002]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:09.262 --> 02:20:09.662]  One more segment.

[02:20:48.923 --> 02:20:51.504]  I was taking nitro two or three times a week.
[02:20:51.824 --> 02:20:56.446]  The very first day after taking Heart and Body Extract, the chest pain was gone.
[02:20:56.846 --> 02:20:58.687]  Now I don't wear a nitro patch.

[02:24:01.347 --> 02:24:05.010]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[02:24:05.130 --> 02:24:06.651]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[02:24:12.446 --> 02:24:14.688]  He's mounted down, loaded up and truckin'.
[02:24:14.728 --> 02:24:16.849]  We're gonna do what they say can't be done.
[02:24:17.230 --> 02:24:36.424]  Alright, I wanna try to get to four or five callers for Gerald, and I know you guys can talk for hours, you're great callers, but we've only got about six minutes in this segment that he's gotta go, then we're gonna open the phones up for vaccine comments, and hit a few other news items, but... So each person, just throw out your question or comment, quick answer from Gerald, and then we'll move to the next person.
[02:24:36.905 --> 02:24:40.507]  Let's go to Joe in California, then we'll go to Rob in New York.
[02:24:40.547 --> 02:24:41.048]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:24:43.530 --> 02:24:56.541]  Hello Alex and Gerald, great to be able to talk to you and my quick question is any ideas on protecting IRAs or 401Ks from government confiscation or how do you feel about gold and silver?
[02:24:56.782 --> 02:24:57.522]  Great question.
[02:24:57.622 --> 02:25:03.407]  Obama did just announce in the State of the Union they want to start grabbing your education funds and taxing them.
[02:25:03.507 --> 02:25:04.228]  It is beginning.
[02:25:04.288 --> 02:25:04.648]  Gerald?
[02:25:05.129 --> 02:25:05.930]  Yes, you're right.
[02:25:06.130 --> 02:25:08.232]  And gold and silver, I'm bullish on both.
[02:25:08.792 --> 02:25:09.792]  Particularly gold.
[02:25:10.052 --> 02:25:12.393]  And again, I buy gold from the golden years.
[02:25:12.993 --> 02:25:15.073]  At some point, this thing is going to collapse.
[02:25:15.434 --> 02:25:18.794]  You're seeing a devaluation of currencies around the world.
[02:25:18.854 --> 02:25:20.635]  So gold for long term for me.
[02:25:21.015 --> 02:25:23.796]  And of course, the government will steal anything that they get their hands on.
[02:25:24.136 --> 02:25:27.656]  And if there's a real market panic, what's going to happen with your IRA?
[02:25:27.696 --> 02:25:28.777]  What is it invested in?
[02:25:29.077 --> 02:25:30.137]  And where is it going to go?
[02:25:30.577 --> 02:25:31.197]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:25:31.677 --> 02:25:32.838]  Let's talk to Rob in New York.
[02:25:32.858 --> 02:25:33.358]  You're on the air.
[02:25:33.398 --> 02:25:33.898]  Go ahead, Rob.
[02:25:36.209 --> 02:25:37.130]  Hey guys, how you doing?
[02:25:37.210 --> 02:25:38.190]  Good, brother.
[02:25:38.430 --> 02:25:45.074]  Alright, Gerald, so the economy, it's not that great.
[02:25:45.835 --> 02:25:51.398]  If we raise interest rates, what is that going to look like for the average person?
[02:25:52.019 --> 02:25:57.422]  And is that something just to help us push the dollar towards parity with the euro?
[02:25:58.646 --> 02:26:16.133]  Well, what's going to happen, the reason why I had believed that there would be a crash is because when they raise interest rates, this Ponzi scheme of banks borrowing at virtually nothing and then loaning it back to us at anything they can get, that starts ending and this equity market start going down.
[02:26:16.493 --> 02:26:18.173]  I mentioned what happened to the U.S.
[02:26:18.253 --> 02:26:22.195]  market from 8,000 to 18, the seven-year highs in Europe.
[02:26:22.595 --> 02:26:27.157]  The market's gone up 57% in Japan from lowering rates.
[02:26:27.697 --> 02:26:29.858]  So when the rates go up, this whole thing collapses.
[02:26:30.478 --> 02:26:31.519]  And it hurts everybody.
[02:26:31.539 --> 02:26:35.901]  But if they keep pumping it, then it will have its own set of problems.
[02:26:35.961 --> 02:26:37.381]  I mean, it's just... Well, exactly.
[02:26:37.662 --> 02:26:38.202]  Exactly.
[02:26:38.242 --> 02:26:41.783]  They're devaluing our currencies, and that's why I'm bullish on gold.
[02:26:42.284 --> 02:26:42.784]  Absolutely.
[02:26:42.824 --> 02:26:46.866]  I mean, long term, it just spells massive inflation, but then they're engaged in a depression.
[02:26:46.886 --> 02:26:48.726]  I hope that answers your question, Rob.
[02:26:48.746 --> 02:26:49.267]  Good question.
[02:26:49.327 --> 02:26:51.768]  Leland in Illinois, you're on the air with Gerald Cilenti.
[02:26:54.422 --> 02:27:03.849]  Well, I want to say that the derivatives market, the bank, the big, the too big to fail banks hold over $200 trillion in derivatives right now.
[02:27:04.149 --> 02:27:06.370]  They just tied that to the FDIC credit.
[02:27:06.390 --> 02:27:07.811]  $2,000 trillion?
[02:27:08.552 --> 02:27:08.872]  Yes.
[02:27:09.072 --> 02:27:16.057]  So shouldn't anyone with a 401 or RACI, anything, shouldn't they take that now and convert that to gold?
[02:27:16.557 --> 02:27:17.778]  I mean, and another thing.
[02:27:18.450 --> 02:27:20.132]  What do you think is trending with Russia?
[02:27:20.152 --> 02:27:22.094]  You've got to do what you think is best.
[02:27:32.273 --> 02:27:32.854]  Let me finish.
[02:27:33.394 --> 02:27:44.144]  All of my IRA, and I have to put it into it because I need the tax deductions, is in gold ETFs.
[02:27:44.404 --> 02:27:46.205]  Would I rather have it in physical?
[02:27:46.325 --> 02:27:47.206]  Of course I would.
[02:27:47.226 --> 02:27:50.329]  Alright, Leland in Illinois, you're chomping at the bit.
[02:27:50.369 --> 02:27:51.510]  Go ahead, what else do you want to say?
[02:27:52.324 --> 02:28:00.306]  Yes, I'll just, with Russia, I mean, you know, the Bible says that the world will have a one world money, a one world economy, and a one world religion.
[02:28:00.646 --> 02:28:04.307]  Now, in order to get that one world money, which they have already, the I.M.F.
[02:28:04.347 --> 02:28:04.647]  has it.
[02:28:04.667 --> 02:28:06.567]  They've got to destroy all the other world currencies.
[02:28:06.907 --> 02:28:08.848]  They've got to destroy the other currencies.
[02:28:08.888 --> 02:28:10.608]  That's why they're doing what they're doing.
[02:28:10.648 --> 02:28:12.509]  That's why the devaluation is going on.
[02:28:12.549 --> 02:28:13.989]  The Bible, what the Bible said,
[02:28:14.609 --> 02:28:23.476]  It is happening exactly like it said, it just didn't give us the details of that Obama would do this and it would cause this and that George Bush would do this and it would cause this.
[02:28:23.657 --> 02:28:25.278]  Well there's no doubt it's serious.
[02:28:25.398 --> 02:28:27.079]  Let me answer that.
[02:28:27.099 --> 02:28:28.781]  You look at, you mentioned Russia.
[02:28:29.421 --> 02:28:32.264]  Russia's been buying gold like there's no tomorrow.
[02:28:32.704 --> 02:28:35.947]  Show of the elites, the billionaires have been buying it while saying we're idiots to get it.
[02:28:36.887 --> 02:28:40.710]  I want to make a comment too about, you know, your advertisers and what I said.
[02:28:41.010 --> 02:28:43.252]  So everybody knows that I'm not blowing smoke.
[02:28:43.592 --> 02:28:51.858]  I don't know if you know this, I have an honorary doctorate in Integrative and Complementary Medicine from the National University of Health Sciences.
[02:28:52.518 --> 02:28:56.619]  The first book that I really worked on was Natural Healing back in 1988.
[02:28:57.700 --> 02:29:05.562]  And if you read the introduction, they thank us for getting so much of the research that went into this book from the Trends Research Institute.
[02:29:05.582 --> 02:29:09.543]  That's right, and you kind of helped kick off a lot of the whole wellness movement we see today.
[02:29:10.353 --> 02:29:10.613]  Right.
[02:29:10.753 --> 02:29:15.857]  So what I'm saying is, what I'm saying to support this, I'm saying it because I believe in it.
[02:29:16.117 --> 02:29:17.278]  And it's what I do.
[02:29:17.678 --> 02:29:19.239]  I'm not like a Brian Williams.
[02:29:19.439 --> 02:29:21.180]  No, we appreciate you supporting our operation.
[02:29:21.220 --> 02:29:21.801]  We support yours.

[02:29:41.552 --> 02:29:44.013]  TrendsResearch.com as well.
[02:29:44.333 --> 02:29:45.433]  Gerald, thank you so much.
[02:29:45.473 --> 02:29:47.194]  We've got loaded phones for you, but we're out of time.
[02:29:47.434 --> 02:29:48.354]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:29:48.374 --> 02:29:49.215]  Thank you so much, champ.
[02:29:49.555 --> 02:29:50.015]  Thank you.
[02:29:50.515 --> 02:29:50.995]  All right, folks.
[02:29:51.015 --> 02:29:52.256]  We're going to clear the board.
[02:29:52.836 --> 02:29:54.797]  We're going to come back with your vaccine stories.
[02:29:54.837 --> 02:29:55.277]  Do you love them?
[02:29:55.297 --> 02:29:55.777]  Do you hate them?
[02:29:56.097 --> 02:29:56.738]  Did they help you?
[02:29:56.878 --> 02:29:57.278]  Or did they...
[02:29:58.001 --> 02:29:58.341]  Kill ya!
[02:29:58.601 --> 02:29:59.502]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.983 --> 02:30:01.604]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.524 --> 02:30:05.306]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.370 --> 02:30:12.372]  Year after year, we watched the threat steadily increase.
[02:30:12.672 --> 02:30:18.016]  And now, this winter has been the worst on record when it comes to our immune systems and health.

[02:32:38.956 --> 02:32:42.458]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:32:42.598 --> 02:32:46.580]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:46.880 --> 02:32:48.341]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:48.661 --> 02:32:56.246]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:32:56.526 --> 02:32:57.386]  But for how long?
[02:32:57.667 --> 02:33:03.930]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:33:04.310 --> 02:33:07.132]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:33:15.569 --> 02:33:26.313]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[02:33:26.453 --> 02:33:31.795]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[02:33:32.355 --> 02:33:37.577]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[02:33:38.418 --> 02:33:39.858]  It is a big idea.
[02:33:40.959 --> 02:33:41.899]  A new world order.
[02:33:45.535 --> 02:33:48.519]  It was almost as if there were planned implosions.
[02:33:48.619 --> 02:33:50.141]  It just pancaked.
[02:33:52.524 --> 02:33:56.349]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[02:34:09.616 --> 02:34:14.079]  I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[02:34:14.099 --> 02:34:20.524]  Guns will be taken and no one will be able to be armed.
[02:34:20.584 --> 02:34:22.905]  We're going to take all guns.
[02:34:23.326 --> 02:34:28.089]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[02:34:28.149 --> 02:34:29.630]  Global governance at last.
[02:34:29.730 --> 02:34:30.691]  Is it one world?
[02:34:30.711 --> 02:34:32.352]  The central bank is in charge.
[02:34:32.392 --> 02:34:35.894]  But aren't we all just living and dying from what the central banks do?
[02:34:35.974 --> 02:34:36.375]  As for me!
[02:34:42.459 --> 02:34:52.287]  Now, I meant to do a whole hour on this, not just one big segment, one small segment.
[02:34:52.327 --> 02:35:01.815]  So sometime tomorrow, or maybe even the Sunday show, I'm going to maybe do a whole show on people calling in with their take on vaccines.
[02:35:02.796 --> 02:35:03.316]  Are you for it?
[02:35:03.376 --> 02:35:03.997]  Are you against it?
[02:35:04.057 --> 02:35:05.558]  What do you think of mandatory vaccinations?
[02:35:05.578 --> 02:35:06.799]  We told you that tyranny was coming.
[02:35:07.079 --> 02:35:08.900]  People said, oh no way, now it's all over the news.
[02:35:08.940 --> 02:35:12.903]  Like, it is mandatory and people aren't doing it and we need to have laws.
[02:35:13.583 --> 02:35:15.465]  So it's mandatory but you need to have laws passed.
[02:35:15.745 --> 02:35:17.006]  You're a pack of liars.
[02:35:19.127 --> 02:35:21.989]  Now the only way to go to a lot of calls is to move quickly through the callers.
[02:35:22.029 --> 02:35:24.291]  If you got a point, got a question, got a comment, make it.
[02:35:25.834 --> 02:35:32.260]  Specifically though, I'm not cherry picking here saying we've opened our phones up for people that agree or disagree only.
[02:35:35.441 --> 02:35:39.505]  I'm not saying call them with your horror stories, but that's what happened for two hours yesterday when we did this.
[02:35:40.225 --> 02:35:41.767]  Horror story after horror story.
[02:35:42.407 --> 02:35:44.429]  My grandmother got polio from the polio vaccine.
[02:35:44.449 --> 02:35:44.969]  They admitted it.
[02:35:45.530 --> 02:35:47.572]  We had like five callers say they got polio.
[02:35:48.012 --> 02:35:51.155]  It's in the news today that parents are getting it from their vaccinated kids.
[02:35:51.715 --> 02:35:52.776]  The measles is spreading it.
[02:35:52.836 --> 02:35:54.218]  It says it on the stinking insert.
[02:35:54.818 --> 02:35:55.939]  And then I have to see stinking
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:03.802]  Bill O'Reilly and stinking MSNBC hosts saying we're liars and there's no side effects.
[02:36:03.842 --> 02:36:05.423]  I mean, they know that's not true!
[02:36:08.344 --> 02:36:12.185]  Just like they all lied about the WMDs and then all said, oh, we knew it was a lie, we were told to.
[02:36:12.545 --> 02:36:13.425]  That's even worse!
[02:36:13.445 --> 02:36:19.327]  I mean, you knew it was a lie and you... I'm so sick of these people, man!
[02:36:24.445 --> 02:36:25.206]  So we're going to go to that.
[02:36:25.786 --> 02:36:28.368]  You heard Gerald Cilente talk about supporting the transmission.
[02:36:29.269 --> 02:36:32.973]  It is your purchase of the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the nutraceuticals.
[02:36:34.235 --> 02:36:42.240]  The cooking stoves, I mean, whatever is a cool gadget, you know, the best rated, you know, outdoor cooking stove, portable little stove, we sell those.
[02:36:42.620 --> 02:36:45.702]  The best crank short waves at the lowest price, we sell those.
[02:36:46.663 --> 02:36:59.271]  I mean, just something, basically, if I bought it and I like it, most of the stuff we carry is where I did research for my family, what I want, and then I end up reaching out, becoming a distributor, usually become the biggest distributor out there for these products.
[02:36:59.932 --> 02:37:01.052]  Pro, pure, you name it.
[02:37:01.813 --> 02:37:03.394]  These shortwave radios we carry,
[02:37:05.489 --> 02:37:10.932]  You know, boom, we're the biggest attributor online, because we sell them at the lowest price.
[02:37:10.952 --> 02:37:16.576]  We sign contracts to sell at the lowest price, because they all make us sign those because they know we'll keep dropping prices.
[02:37:16.976 --> 02:37:17.957]  We're worse than Amazon.
[02:37:17.977 --> 02:37:21.559]  I mean, we sell a lot of stuff less than Amazon, just to give you an idea.
[02:37:21.939 --> 02:37:26.282]  So, infowarsstore.com or infowarslife.com.
[02:37:28.143 --> 02:37:29.004]  Thousands of items.
[02:37:29.544 --> 02:37:37.068]  And we've got the Moulin Lambe camouflage shirts, made in America, and they're about to sell out in extra large and large.
[02:37:37.108 --> 02:37:38.909]  I mean, we just can't keep them in stock.
[02:37:38.949 --> 02:37:39.289]  We can't.
[02:37:39.349 --> 02:37:44.032]  And the problem is, I cannot get enough from the only factory in the U.S.
[02:37:44.192 --> 02:37:44.832]  that makes these.
[02:37:46.013 --> 02:37:50.316]  So I'm gonna have to make a deal with them just to scale up, making it like 300 of each size.
[02:37:50.356 --> 02:37:51.196]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:37:52.177 --> 02:37:53.477]  This is a really popular shirt.
[02:37:53.537 --> 02:37:54.218]  It's back in.
[02:37:54.298 --> 02:37:55.939]  It sells out within days.
[02:37:57.059 --> 02:37:59.120]  Unless you want it for your wife or something and small.
[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:00.140]  It's really good-looking.
[02:38:00.200 --> 02:38:00.740]  I designed it.
[02:38:01.180 --> 02:38:02.561]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:38:02.621 --> 02:38:03.721]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:38:04.142 --> 02:38:06.002]  I want to play this ad that we cut yesterday.
[02:38:06.022 --> 02:38:12.104]  I don't usually play ads during the segments, but I think it says it all about super male and super female vitality.
[02:38:12.424 --> 02:38:14.505]  A huge sale we've got going right now.
[02:38:14.745 --> 02:38:16.226]  Let's play that clip, then we'll go to your calls.
[02:38:16.943 --> 02:38:19.986]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[02:38:20.327 --> 02:38:23.611]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[02:38:23.831 --> 02:38:29.838]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[02:38:29.918 --> 02:38:31.099]  I'm all about human potential.
[02:38:31.319 --> 02:38:31.800]  I'm all about...
[02:38:31.940 --> 02:38:33.440]  The individual being empowered.
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:35.021]  The establishment is the opposite.
[02:38:35.081 --> 02:38:39.622]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[02:38:39.882 --> 02:38:44.243]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[02:38:44.463 --> 02:38:46.803]  How we can come together and win the human race.
[02:38:47.103 --> 02:38:55.005]  And to celebrate the kickoff of Human Empowerment Month, we're slashing prices on InfoWarsLife.com products like Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[02:38:55.165 --> 02:38:58.706]  The sale is only running for the month, 20% off, and there's a lot of other
[02:38:58.746 --> 02:39:03.649]  And this whole media operation, all these people, all these cameras, the crews, the researchers, it's all you buying the products.
[02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:03.950]  So...
[02:39:25.302 --> 02:39:27.524]  We do have a couple specials that are still running, too.
[02:39:27.544 --> 02:39:30.247]  You can get two bottles of nascent iodine, X2.
[02:39:30.308 --> 02:39:31.849]  Nobody else has got iodine like this.
[02:39:32.230 --> 02:39:32.590]  Try it.
[02:39:33.011 --> 02:39:34.232]  You've heard the rave reviews.
[02:39:34.272 --> 02:39:35.013]  I've been blown away.
[02:39:35.353 --> 02:39:37.916]  Goes through and scoops out the bad halogens, blocks them.
[02:39:39.237 --> 02:39:40.018]  It's just amazing.
[02:39:40.098 --> 02:39:42.181]  I mean, that's why they don't want you to get enough iodine.
[02:39:42.221 --> 02:39:42.921]  It's a big secret.
[02:39:43.722 --> 02:39:48.025]  We've got the highest quality oil of oregano in caplets from the Mediterranean.
[02:39:49.526 --> 02:39:51.987]  I wanted this because I'm sick of putting it in my mouth, it burns.
[02:39:52.387 --> 02:39:54.969]  So that's available, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:39:55.429 --> 02:40:05.215]  You can get a free bottle of Ancient Defense Herbal Booster, two ounces, huge value, free with two bottles of X2 when you get the survival shield.
[02:40:05.796 --> 02:40:09.918]  Oxy powder, you name it, colloidal silver, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:40:10.619 --> 02:40:12.660]  Okay, before we go any further here today,
[02:40:14.244 --> 02:40:15.865]  Please support our AM and FM affiliates.
[02:40:16.486 --> 02:40:17.286]  Spread the word about them.
[02:40:17.326 --> 02:40:18.087]  Become a sponsor.
[02:40:18.127 --> 02:40:19.127]  Support their sponsors.
[02:40:19.488 --> 02:40:21.049]  That's also how we spread the word.
[02:40:21.369 --> 02:40:24.411]  Have you sent a link to the iPhone or Droid app to friends and family today?
[02:40:24.872 --> 02:40:27.633]  Have you posted something from InfoWars on Facebook or Twitter today?
[02:40:28.054 --> 02:40:30.355]  Have you called in to talk radio to plug InfoWars today?
[02:40:30.876 --> 02:40:32.157]  This is how we're going to get aggressive.
[02:40:32.737 --> 02:40:40.480]  I mean, this is a professional, hardcore, no-compromise operation that really cuts through the fog and wakes people up with pertinent info.
[02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:43.161]  Common Sense Americana.
[02:40:43.721 --> 02:40:44.281]  1776 worldwide.
[02:40:44.981 --> 02:40:50.863]  If you stand up and take action, which you've been doing, that's why we have the White House surrogates attacking us daily.
[02:40:51.704 --> 02:40:53.804]  You've got a commitment from this operation.
[02:40:54.105 --> 02:40:55.805]  Like, I'm a B-17 bomber pilot.
[02:40:56.125 --> 02:40:58.026]  I will go over the heaviest enemy targets.
[02:40:58.326 --> 02:40:59.446]  I will fly under the flak.
[02:40:59.747 --> 02:41:00.687]  I will pull the lever.
[02:41:01.735 --> 02:41:05.498]  And I will send those info weapons down on the enemy, no matter what happens to me.
[02:41:06.539 --> 02:41:13.364]  But I need you to fuel us on the tarmac, and you've got a commitment that we're going to hammer the hell out of the enemy.
[02:41:13.784 --> 02:41:20.990]  No compromise, with all our passion, all our creativity, we will savage them like a pit bull on a wild hog.
[02:41:21.270 --> 02:41:24.132]  We will go for the neck, we will never surrender.
[02:41:24.412 --> 02:41:28.456]  We shall go on to the end, whatever the cost may be, to quote Churchill.
[02:41:29.264 --> 02:41:30.925]  Whether you like Churchill or not, it's a great speech.
[02:41:31.845 --> 02:41:34.406]  It's the intro to Ace's High, but they never play it on the radio.
[02:41:34.767 --> 02:41:35.667]  Maybe you can find it on YouTube.
[02:41:35.807 --> 02:41:36.547]  We can play it next segment.
[02:41:36.848 --> 02:41:37.948]  We shall go on to the end.
[02:41:38.668 --> 02:41:39.249]  We shall fight.
[02:41:39.409 --> 02:41:40.369]  We shall never surrender.
[02:41:40.669 --> 02:41:45.712]  That's a good feeling to just know you're committed, you're on the right side of history, win or lose.
[02:41:46.152 --> 02:41:47.092]  We're on the right side.
[02:41:47.112 --> 02:41:48.813]  You know, God's behind us.
[02:41:48.933 --> 02:41:49.573]  It's that simple.
[02:41:49.754 --> 02:41:50.954]  And how do I know God's behind us?
[02:41:51.214 --> 02:41:52.535]  My conscience feels clear.
[02:41:52.795 --> 02:41:53.675]  I feel empowered.
[02:41:54.035 --> 02:41:55.056]  I feel strong.
[02:41:55.396 --> 02:41:56.256]  I feel committed.
[02:41:56.616 --> 02:42:00.358]  And the minute I start thinking about not fighting 110%, I feel weak.
[02:42:00.618 --> 02:42:01.358]  I feel pathetic.
[02:42:01.618 --> 02:42:02.339]  I feel dishonored.
[02:42:02.359 --> 02:42:05.300]  I mean, the spirit leaves me.
[02:42:07.261 --> 02:42:07.962]  It's that simple, folks.
[02:42:07.982 --> 02:42:08.582]  And that's what it's all about.
[02:42:08.602 --> 02:42:09.763]  It's about spirit, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:09.964 --> 02:42:11.265]  This country's lost its spirit.
[02:42:11.565 --> 02:42:12.586]  It's lost its will.
[02:42:12.826 --> 02:42:13.807]  It's lost its dignity.
[02:42:14.047 --> 02:42:14.928]  It's lost its honor.
[02:42:15.208 --> 02:42:16.430]  It's lost its manhood.
[02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:17.611]  It's lost its womanhood.
[02:42:17.911 --> 02:42:20.073]  We have been sucked dry and put under a spell.
[02:42:20.393 --> 02:42:22.295]  Well, it's time to break the spell!
[02:42:23.236 --> 02:42:23.736]  Do it!
[02:42:24.797 --> 02:42:28.201]  Ask God to move on you and get that spirit of the devil off of you!
[02:42:29.104 --> 02:42:37.310]  When I talk about the spirit of the devil, I don't mean all these church bugs with their church keys saying, you know, don't drink a beer, don't whistle, you know, don't think women are beautiful.
[02:42:37.510 --> 02:42:38.351]  God made women.
[02:42:38.651 --> 02:42:39.452]  God made men.
[02:42:39.792 --> 02:42:41.774]  And I'm not saying anybody's perfect either.
[02:42:41.974 --> 02:42:45.797]  But the real sin's putting veterans on secret death lists and nobody doing anything.
[02:42:46.237 --> 02:42:47.558]  The real sin's aborting babies.
[02:42:47.998 --> 02:42:50.761]  The real sin's lying about WMDs and killing over a million people.
[02:42:51.181 --> 02:42:53.783]  The real sin's establishing world government and starting war with Russia.
[02:42:54.243 --> 02:42:58.366]  The real sin is putting GMO in the food and cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[02:42:59.207 --> 02:43:04.934]  Now, I'm going to your calls, one person after another, with your testimony about vaccines or your take on it.
[02:43:06.356 --> 02:43:07.036]  Let's go ahead.
[02:43:07.117 --> 02:43:09.239]  I'm going to go to Ron in Pennsylvania first.
[02:43:09.279 --> 02:43:11.342]  I'm going to go to Marty, Matt, Kelly, and Tom.
[02:43:12.223 --> 02:43:14.065]  Let's go ahead and go to Ron in PA.
[02:43:14.085 --> 02:43:14.646]  You're on the air.
[02:43:17.136 --> 02:43:17.816]  Hi, Alex.
[02:43:18.256 --> 02:43:19.797]  Thanks so much for your program.
[02:43:19.977 --> 02:43:20.257]  Thank you.
[02:43:20.277 --> 02:43:21.238]  I really appreciate it.
[02:43:22.258 --> 02:43:24.379]  I definitely am against vaccines.
[02:43:25.119 --> 02:43:28.681]  And I believe in a greater power, my creator.
[02:43:28.701 --> 02:43:33.903]  Pharmaceuticals in the revelation is called from from Maka.
[02:43:35.223 --> 02:43:39.965]  I believe it says deceive the whole world or control the whole world.
[02:43:40.738 --> 02:43:44.122]  But in 66 I went into the U.S.
[02:43:44.202 --> 02:43:48.706]  Air Force as an orphan status.
[02:43:49.247 --> 02:43:50.128]  I had no parents.
[02:43:50.749 --> 02:43:59.558]  The Air Force took me later on, experimented on me for a whole bunch of vaccines and near killed me, sent me home empty-handed.
[02:44:00.158 --> 02:44:00.539]  We're good to go.
[02:44:17.773 --> 02:44:20.414]  Well, tell more of your story, brother, because that's what they do.
[02:44:20.674 --> 02:44:21.775]  They test on our troops.
[02:44:22.175 --> 02:44:23.715]  Thousands of declassified tests.
[02:44:24.096 --> 02:44:25.016]  Many of them lethal.
[02:44:25.356 --> 02:44:32.279]  Pregnant wives of G.I.s from the 40s through the 70s were given uranium and plutonium pills when they were pregnant to see what it would do to the babies.
[02:44:32.699 --> 02:44:34.560]  I mean, we need to... It's not our government.
[02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:35.780]  It's criminals within it.
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:38.141]  And we need to stop denying how evil they are.
[02:44:39.202 --> 02:44:40.262]  You're exactly right.
[02:44:40.282 --> 02:44:42.183]  It's the criminal within our government.
[02:44:43.067 --> 02:44:49.892]  And I know when they took me and I had no idea what they were doing, they never told me.
[02:44:49.932 --> 02:44:51.873]  They just said, you're on a special status.
[02:44:52.433 --> 02:44:56.836]  And I started getting stuff that nobody else got until I could not walk.
[02:44:57.396 --> 02:45:01.259]  It cost me my aircraft, jet mechanics career in the military.
[02:45:02.280 --> 02:45:03.581]  I was sent home sick.
[02:45:05.142 --> 02:45:06.783]  It's just, it's terrible.
[02:45:07.403 --> 02:45:09.144]  Well it's really weird how they operate.
[02:45:09.924 --> 02:45:10.985]  They love to get orphans.
[02:45:11.165 --> 02:45:13.066]  They love orphan black kids.
[02:45:13.526 --> 02:45:15.607]  That's just usually, that's who they'd rather kill.
[02:45:16.068 --> 02:45:18.609]  But they'll kill white people and Hispanics and Asians all day too.
[02:45:18.989 --> 02:45:20.390]  They really love to kill Appalachians.
[02:45:20.850 --> 02:45:23.672]  But I've seen this thousands of times in news where it comes out.
[02:45:24.312 --> 02:45:28.597]  And in the military too, it's like you didn't have a family, you must have a bad gene pool.
[02:45:28.617 --> 02:45:30.559]  We have a clip where they say this at the legislature.
[02:45:30.939 --> 02:45:31.119]  Yeah.
[02:45:31.419 --> 02:45:33.141]  And I've played the clip just last week.
[02:45:33.602 --> 02:45:35.584]  And so, yeah, they segregate you.
[02:45:35.604 --> 02:45:36.845]  And that was in the old days.
[02:45:37.245 --> 02:45:38.206]  Oh, we're doing it to blacks.
[02:45:38.226 --> 02:45:39.087]  We're doing it to orphans.
[02:45:39.107 --> 02:45:40.489]  We're doing it to white trash.
[02:45:40.509 --> 02:45:41.109]  We're doing it to you.
[02:45:41.330 --> 02:45:42.731]  This is what they say behind the scenes.
[02:45:43.252 --> 02:45:45.274]  But then if you were like my dad, top of his class,
[02:45:45.774 --> 02:46:05.816]  You know, one of the most 15 smart in Texas in these Texas Academy of Science tests, out of tens of thousands, they called him in when he was a junior in high school and said, we're establishing a world government, we're taking over, and we'd like to recruit you in and go to Plan 2 at UT and you could join the CIA or you could join special, you know, this and that.
[02:46:06.517 --> 02:46:10.100]  So, so, see, you're an orphan, so we're just gonna test this stuff on you.
[02:46:10.140 --> 02:46:12.482]  But, oh, Mr. Jones, you're real smart, wanna join us.
[02:46:12.662 --> 02:46:13.343]  He didn't join them.
[02:46:13.843 --> 02:46:16.766]  But this is an example of the real system ruling things.
[02:46:16.786 --> 02:46:17.106]  Go ahead.
[02:46:18.371 --> 02:46:21.394]  Yeah, I've gotten vaccines for 18 months every month.
[02:46:21.894 --> 02:46:23.756]  I got another vaccine of some kind.
[02:46:23.776 --> 02:46:26.458]  No, I talked to one of Rick Perry's top staff people.
[02:46:26.778 --> 02:46:29.340]  He came to Endgame premiere and he said, listen, the governor likes you.
[02:46:29.901 --> 02:46:30.882]  I heard he was in this film.
[02:46:30.942 --> 02:46:32.343]  You don't need to attack the governor.
[02:46:32.403 --> 02:46:34.045]  Let me just tell you, I was in the military.
[02:46:34.445 --> 02:46:39.209]  I was a medic and I was at Fort Sam Houston Medical Center in San Antonio.
[02:46:39.369 --> 02:46:41.811]  And they would bring in troops and kill them with vaccines.
[02:46:41.851 --> 02:46:43.473]  I mean, they would die in three days.
[02:46:44.434 --> 02:46:45.235]  God bless you, sir.
[02:46:45.716 --> 02:46:48.682]  I mean, this is a guy I'd see on TV with Rick Perry at his press conferences.
[02:46:50.465 --> 02:46:53.590]  I mean, it's just, it's so widespread, it hides in plain view.
[02:46:55.725 --> 02:46:56.225]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:46:57.386 --> 02:46:59.448]  I really appreciate what you've been doing for the veteran.
[02:47:00.028 --> 02:47:02.970]  But they cleaned me out, took my medical records and stuff.
[02:47:03.531 --> 02:47:11.877]  And just about 10 years ago, somebody stepped up behind the scene and made sure that I got my medical records that was taken from me.
[02:47:11.897 --> 02:47:12.317]  That's right.
[02:47:12.457 --> 02:47:15.259]  And that's how I know the vaccines they gave me.
[02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:17.861]  Well, that's why there's a lot of patriots on the inside.
[02:47:17.881 --> 02:47:19.443]  And there's a war between good and evil.
[02:47:19.463 --> 02:47:21.484]  And that's why we got to support the good guys.
[02:47:21.524 --> 02:47:22.045]  I got to go.
[02:47:22.065 --> 02:47:23.686]  See, I said I'd give each caller a minute.
[02:47:23.706 --> 02:47:24.847]  That guy was on for five minutes.
[02:47:25.968 --> 02:47:28.029]  But it's just too powerful, these stories.
[02:47:28.950 --> 02:47:29.970]  Too powerful.
[02:47:31.551 --> 02:47:38.615]  And it's just accepted that, you know, there's one of Rick Perry's top people, one of his press people, admitting he saw people murdered, and it's just no big deal.
[02:47:40.857 --> 02:47:42.598]  I mean, we just accept anything in this country.
[02:47:43.278 --> 02:47:49.202]  And look, I don't sit there and support the veterans because I'm one of these people that claims they support the veterans because it gets me support.
[02:47:49.962 --> 02:47:53.164]  I support anybody who's being targeted, like unborn babies.
[02:47:55.623 --> 02:48:00.406]  Anybody they attack who doesn't deserve it, I'm immediately support them.
[02:48:00.466 --> 02:48:01.687]  Man, we're all in this together.
[02:48:01.707 --> 02:48:03.608]  That's what people don't get out there.
[02:48:03.868 --> 02:48:06.430]  It's not heroic to stand up for people that are under attack.
[02:48:07.410 --> 02:48:09.532]  I want to be stood up for when I'm under attack.
[02:48:11.073 --> 02:48:12.013]  It's common sense.
[02:48:12.353 --> 02:48:13.254]  That's all it is.
[02:48:13.694 --> 02:48:16.276]  All these scum in the government think it's cute to sell people out.
[02:48:18.251 --> 02:48:22.434]  Well, I wouldn't want to get between them and God when God's hammer comes down on them, and it ain't gonna be when they die.
[02:48:22.474 --> 02:48:23.575]  That'll be the second judgment.
[02:48:24.055 --> 02:48:26.256]  You get judged in this life, and I'm God-fearing.
[02:48:26.476 --> 02:48:28.017]  These people have no idea what they're facing.
[02:48:28.738 --> 02:48:30.139]  Let's talk to Tom in New York.
[02:48:30.219 --> 02:48:31.060]  Tom, you're on the air.
[02:48:31.100 --> 02:48:31.460]  Go ahead.
[02:48:33.601 --> 02:48:34.141]  Hey, what's up?
[02:48:34.522 --> 02:48:35.642]  Worldwide broadcast, brother.
[02:48:35.662 --> 02:48:36.403]  Go ahead.
[02:48:36.983 --> 02:48:37.423]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:38.224 --> 02:48:40.605]  I called up another radio show this morning.
[02:48:40.645 --> 02:48:42.426]  I don't know if I'm allowed to say the name, but whatever.
[02:48:42.506 --> 02:48:43.027]  Laura Ingram.
[02:48:43.187 --> 02:48:49.431]  I called her this morning because she had a doctor on who was telling the whole world that they need to go and get their kids vaccinated today.
[02:48:49.451 --> 02:48:50.331]  You've got to do it.
[02:48:50.871 --> 02:48:57.095]  It was a giant worldwide push, not just here, to try to make everybody take shots ahead of passing laws to make it mandatory.
[02:48:57.315 --> 02:48:58.916]  And all these pro-vacciners can know this.
[02:48:59.157 --> 02:48:59.757]  Go to hell!
[02:49:00.037 --> 02:49:04.759]  And when people get hurt by your vaccines that you push, we're going to hold all these talk show hosts responsible!
[02:49:05.180 --> 02:49:05.820]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:49:07.201 --> 02:49:17.946]  No, you're right, man, because I tried to call in and tell the doctor, what are you going to do when you're wrong, considering what you're, you know, you're just regurgitating hearsay and opinions, considering everyone's opinion is differing on this matter.
[02:49:17.966 --> 02:49:19.827]  You know, what are you going to do with the blood on your hands?
[02:49:19.887 --> 02:49:24.069]  And of course, Laura hung up on me as I was going to try to say, you bring a guy on,
[02:49:25.031 --> 02:49:26.051]  Who sells medicine.
[02:49:27.291 --> 02:49:28.312]  This guy sells medicine.
[02:49:28.532 --> 02:49:31.612]  Well, let me tell you how to counter these PR doctors.
[02:49:31.632 --> 02:49:32.453]  Most of them are getting money.
[02:49:32.893 --> 02:49:37.654]  You say, sir, have you read the insert of the measles shot where it admits it can give you measles?
[02:49:38.134 --> 02:49:39.214]  And you say, I have three points.
[02:49:39.554 --> 02:49:40.594]  Just quick ones, I want you to answer them.
[02:49:40.614 --> 02:49:41.635]  Thank you so much for having me on.
[02:49:42.635 --> 02:49:49.656]  Number one, are you aware that the MMR shot says it can give you the measles or even give you diabetes?
[02:49:49.816 --> 02:49:52.477]  Hold on, let me just give you the part two.
[02:49:53.508 --> 02:49:55.228]  Because he'll interrupt you and say, let me just get the second question.
[02:49:56.109 --> 02:50:00.570]  And then say separately, you know, how much have you gotten from pharmaceutical companies over the years?
[02:50:00.850 --> 02:50:02.510]  You know, and kickbacks as we know doctors get.
[02:50:02.530 --> 02:50:04.031]  Hold on, don't interrupt, because he'll do that.
[02:50:04.491 --> 02:50:11.432]  And then say, number three, you know, don't act like there haven't been giant disasters like the swine flu vaccine that killed over 10,000 people.
[02:50:12.073 --> 02:50:13.773]  Or SV40 cancer viruses.
[02:50:13.813 --> 02:50:15.033]  I mean, be honest, doctor.
[02:50:15.794 --> 02:50:16.994]  That's how you respond to them.
[02:50:17.034 --> 02:50:17.314]  Go ahead.
[02:50:18.635 --> 02:50:23.238]  I even brought up the Jenny McCarthy thing, how she said that her daughter or whatever died in her arms for two minutes.
[02:50:23.618 --> 02:50:26.520]  And he said, well, I just do not, I do not believe her whatsoever.
[02:50:26.861 --> 02:50:28.862]  I'm sorry to say, and it was like ridiculous.
[02:50:28.882 --> 02:50:32.304]  I brought up Dr. Wakefield and he just... No, brother, let me tell you something.
[02:50:32.364 --> 02:50:33.045]  You did it.
[02:50:33.145 --> 02:50:34.226]  You called into a show.
[02:50:34.286 --> 02:50:35.407]  You hammered the enemy.
[02:50:35.847 --> 02:50:37.248]  You call into C-SPAN, whatever.
[02:50:37.288 --> 02:50:37.748]  You did it.
[02:50:37.768 --> 02:50:39.229]  I wasn't second guessing what you said.
[02:50:39.449 --> 02:50:40.290]  You did a great job.
[02:50:40.350 --> 02:50:44.473]  Just calling in to fight these people was, was, was the spirit we need, brother.
[02:50:46.388 --> 02:50:46.688]  Definitely.
[02:50:47.088 --> 02:50:48.549]  It's more of just a warning to everyone.
[02:50:48.749 --> 02:50:49.930]  Don't fuss before Ingram, man.
[02:50:50.150 --> 02:50:50.790]  You can't fuss there.
[02:50:51.251 --> 02:50:53.392]  Well, I mean, I would just say read the inserts.
[02:50:53.452 --> 02:50:54.612]  Don't believe this doctor.
[02:50:55.013 --> 02:50:56.513]  Read the insert that comes with it.
[02:50:56.573 --> 02:50:59.875]  Not the fake fact sheet they give you at Walgreens or CVS.
[02:51:00.135 --> 02:51:01.496]  Tell them, I want the insert.
[02:51:01.576 --> 02:51:06.919]  And sit out and read the 50 different ways it'll kill you deader than a big old iron hammer.
[02:51:09.432 --> 02:51:10.252]  This is an alert.
[02:51:10.512 --> 02:51:14.494]  If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.
[02:51:14.634 --> 02:51:18.696]  This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space, church, or warehouse.

[02:51:39.324 --> 02:51:39.904]  Hear that?
[02:51:40.544 --> 02:51:44.766]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[02:51:45.926 --> 02:51:48.187]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:51:48.707 --> 02:51:51.988]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[02:52:08.433 --> 02:52:12.075]  My name's Clyde, age 59, and I reside in Florence, South Carolina.
[02:52:12.335 --> 02:52:14.696]  The doctors diagnosed me as having clogged arteries.
[02:52:14.956 --> 02:52:18.177]  It felt like I was carrying heavy concrete blocks around my feet and legs.
[02:52:18.618 --> 02:52:21.259]  I started taking heart and body extract as directed.
[02:52:21.519 --> 02:52:23.980]  It is less than three weeks, and I'm like a young man again.
[02:52:24.300 --> 02:52:28.182]  It's unbelievable that an herbal formula can work so fast and so powerfully.

[02:52:37.955 --> 02:52:47.220]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:52:47.260 --> 02:52:48.000]  This capitalism?
[02:52:48.060 --> 02:52:54.164]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:52:54.224 --> 02:52:57.866]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:54:19.078 --> 02:54:23.242]  Michael Savage has come out saying Romney was forced out to ensure Hillary victory in 2016.
[02:54:24.143 --> 02:54:26.165]  Video, Bill Ayers admits he knows nothing.
[02:54:27.234 --> 02:54:27.994]  That's pretty funny.
[02:54:28.474 --> 02:54:31.175]  Man arrested on terrorism charges for carrying protein snacks.
[02:54:31.235 --> 02:54:31.875]  Power bar.
[02:54:32.376 --> 02:54:34.636]  They still tried to put him in prison for it, saying they were bombs.
[02:54:35.336 --> 02:54:36.317]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[02:54:36.377 --> 02:54:37.357]  Manufactured terror.
[02:54:37.437 --> 02:54:38.077]  Not the economy.
[02:54:38.097 --> 02:54:39.158]  Will dominate 2016.
[02:54:39.618 --> 02:54:42.519]  How the elite to plan to achieve digital immortality.
[02:54:42.539 --> 02:54:44.919]  They've openly announced their plan to merge the machines and live forever.
[02:54:45.359 --> 02:54:48.180]  Something that the media has made fun of in my film, Endgame, and I'm quoting them.
[02:54:48.780 --> 02:54:49.781]  The powerful video.
[02:54:49.841 --> 02:54:50.641]  Car hacking.
[02:54:51.001 --> 02:54:52.001]  Someone dies at the end.
[02:54:52.061 --> 02:54:52.722]  Infowars.com.
[02:54:54.002 --> 02:54:57.965]  Cop who killed 95-year-old over refusal of medical treatment found not guilty.
[02:54:58.786 --> 02:55:00.407]  We're going to kill you because you won't go to the hospital.
[02:55:00.427 --> 02:55:03.369]  That's, again, cops following orders.
[02:55:03.969 --> 02:55:07.612]  And again, I blame the cops, but I also more blame this whole nanny state.
[02:55:08.573 --> 02:55:09.213]  Very dangerous.
[02:55:09.233 --> 02:55:14.317]  A lot of folks call the nanny state anything that's going to help them, and it ends up tearing them up like being fed into a hay baler.
[02:55:16.258 --> 02:55:18.120]  The biggest victims of this are those that believe in it.
[02:55:19.161 --> 02:55:21.222]  Marty in Texas, thanks for holding.
[02:55:21.262 --> 02:55:21.823]  You're on the air.
[02:55:21.863 --> 02:55:22.203]  Go ahead.
[02:55:24.895 --> 02:55:25.515]  All right.
[02:55:25.675 --> 02:55:34.678]  What we need to do is to attack the inevitability that they seem to be pushing of mandatory vaccines.
[02:55:35.119 --> 02:55:35.979]  Yeah, I'm not doing it.
[02:55:36.459 --> 02:55:39.080]  But what they're going to do is start not letting you have a job or travel without it.
[02:55:39.100 --> 02:55:40.760]  I mean, this is it.
[02:55:41.321 --> 02:55:43.741]  So the government can put in you whatever they want.
[02:55:44.021 --> 02:55:45.462]  Boy, that sounds like freedom, doesn't it?
[02:55:46.801 --> 02:55:47.242]  Indeed.
[02:55:47.442 --> 02:55:50.805]  Well, there's a couple things we can actually do about that, I think.
[02:55:50.925 --> 02:55:54.548]  And one is to really frame it as an issue of choice.
[02:55:55.049 --> 02:56:07.641]  And that's what I was alluding to earlier, was start using the hashtag MyBodyMyChoice on every piece of vaccine news.
[02:56:08.001 --> 02:56:08.262]  I agree.
[02:56:08.322 --> 02:56:17.219]  Let's put out a vaccine article and put hashtag my body my choice because hey it's about being pro-choice to be able to not take the vaccine.
[02:56:17.559 --> 02:56:18.601]  Absolutely a great idea.
[02:56:19.705 --> 02:56:20.166]  Exactly.
[02:56:20.246 --> 02:56:34.037]  And to that end, I've started a Facebook page, Facebook.com Vaccine Choice, where there will be a bunch of resources and the truth and studies and articles that you can use to combat the paper cutout doctors on TV.
[02:56:34.057 --> 02:56:39.102]  Well, you know what my dad does and what other doctors do with these medical boards that try to make medical workers take shots?
[02:56:39.722 --> 02:56:43.786]  My dad, years ago, this has been going on for 20 years, he'd go in and he'd follow and he'd say, you know what, to the board?
[02:56:44.506 --> 02:56:45.728]  My dad's actually been on some boards.
[02:56:46.389 --> 02:56:46.929]  He said, you know what?
[02:56:47.049 --> 02:56:55.821]  I'll do that, but you've got to sign this form saying you'll take full responsibility for any medical complications because the inserts says it can do all this.
[02:56:55.861 --> 02:56:56.261]  And you know what?
[02:56:56.281 --> 02:56:57.042]  They go, you know what?
[02:56:57.683 --> 02:56:59.385]  Dr. Jones, you don't need to take it.
[02:57:00.253 --> 02:57:02.473]  I mean, my dad's not going to take a hepatitis shot every year.
[02:57:02.533 --> 02:57:03.074]  My dad's not going to.
[02:57:03.234 --> 02:57:04.234]  Those things were making him sick.
[02:57:04.254 --> 02:57:04.994]  He's not stupid.
[02:57:05.654 --> 02:57:06.834]  So it's just pure bull.
[02:57:06.874 --> 02:57:08.555]  I mean, we need to, we're in a war, folks.
[02:57:08.835 --> 02:57:14.636]  We've got to, just like five years ago, I had the whole flu thing hanging up signs about how dangerous vaccines are.
[02:57:15.096 --> 02:57:16.296]  I want to do that again, too.
[02:57:16.336 --> 02:57:17.756]  I just don't have the resources and the energy.
[02:57:18.076 --> 02:57:23.497]  So folks, go to our old flu vaccine contest page, print the flyers off yourselves, start putting them up.
[02:57:23.537 --> 02:57:24.678]  I mean, just get aggressive.
[02:57:25.018 --> 02:57:25.738]  You know what to do.
[02:57:25.798 --> 02:57:26.358]  God bless you.
[02:57:26.838 --> 02:57:27.720]  Great idea, Marty.
[02:57:27.740 --> 02:57:28.923]  Thanks for holding to talk about that.
[02:57:29.564 --> 02:57:32.551]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in Idaho, then Kelly in Texas and others.
[02:57:32.892 --> 02:57:33.473]  Matt, welcome.
[02:57:35.546 --> 02:57:43.229]  I just wanted to let you know that I'm a nurse, and I was on a vaccination team up here in Idaho back when the H1N1 was the big hot item.
[02:57:43.910 --> 02:57:47.591]  And I went out, and when I went out to the schools, I saw a few kids get sick.
[02:57:47.611 --> 02:57:55.295]  And when I got home, I turned on the TV, and I saw Larry King was doing a story on 42 deaths by the vaccine over the weekend.
[02:57:55.975 --> 02:58:03.519]  So I sent out an email, and the next day, I got fired and threatened.
[02:58:06.727 --> 02:58:08.108]  Sir, I want to get your name and number.
[02:58:08.228 --> 02:58:12.932]  I'd like to get you on Skype or fly people like you here to go back, find the story.
[02:58:12.952 --> 02:58:20.259]  Because I mean, yeah, these vaccines, I see Reuters, AP, Bloomberg all the time where they tested it on 200 homeless, 35 died one day later.
[02:58:20.459 --> 02:58:22.100]  I mean, they admit it's killing.
[02:58:22.120 --> 02:58:23.602]  It's like a firing squad.
[02:58:24.757 --> 02:58:25.978]  Well, I got more.
[02:58:26.418 --> 02:58:29.860]  I mean, me and my brother sued the state of Washington.
[02:58:29.880 --> 02:58:32.081]  We were both molested in child care.
[02:58:32.121 --> 02:58:33.962]  We sued the state of Washington to the tune.
[02:58:34.322 --> 02:58:42.126]  We settled out of court for almost two million dollars, which Christine Grellish and Bill Gilbert, our representing attorneys, took three quarters of it.
[02:58:42.306 --> 02:58:43.786]  We got basically... Well, stay there.
[02:58:43.847 --> 02:58:44.587]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[02:58:44.607 --> 02:58:46.548]  We're going to Overdrive and FullWorks.com.
[02:58:46.588 --> 02:58:47.268]  Pray for America.
[02:58:47.308 --> 02:58:47.889]  Pray for peace.
[02:58:48.149 --> 02:58:48.789]  Pray for justice.
[02:58:49.029 --> 02:58:50.630]  Pray that you repent and wake up.
[02:58:52.601 --> 02:58:53.102]  Unbelievable.
[02:58:53.222 --> 02:58:55.024]  We ought to do a piece about abortion vaccines.
[02:58:55.064 --> 02:58:57.247]  The new vaccine that kills you quicker.
[02:58:58.128 --> 02:58:58.829]  Suicide Vac.
[02:58:59.270 --> 02:59:01.112]  What disaster is so powerful?
[02:59:01.392 --> 02:59:06.219]  It unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots.
[02:59:06.739 --> 02:59:07.821]  All at the same time.
[02:59:08.181 --> 02:59:10.284]  NASA has already set the countdown timer.
[02:59:10.564 --> 02:59:14.785]  And right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[02:59:15.285 --> 02:59:18.706]  Former CIA director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[02:59:18.746 --> 02:59:19.947]  population could perish.
[02:59:20.407 --> 02:59:23.408]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[02:59:23.868 --> 02:59:25.648]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[02:59:26.108 --> 02:59:27.369]  Mass riots will follow.
[02:59:27.749 --> 02:59:29.469]  Ancient diseases will reemerge.
[02:59:29.929 --> 02:59:33.470]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?
[02:59:34.010 --> 02:59:39.692]  Go to darkestdays.info to find out proven methods of protecting yourself, your loved ones,
[02:59:39.952 --> 02:59:41.073]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.317 --> 03:00:15.078]  All right, Fix Bayonets, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.098 --> 03:00:16.539]  We're cutting this intro out today.
[03:00:16.559 --> 03:00:21.082]  I want to get into a few more calls, but I was just reading this Michael Savage transcript.
[03:00:21.703 --> 03:00:22.443]  Fix Bayonets.
[03:00:22.483 --> 03:00:24.104]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[03:00:24.205 --> 03:00:24.745]  Incredible.
[03:00:25.285 --> 03:00:29.628]  Where he talks about the Bilderberg group, selecting people, how it's all a rigged horse race.
[03:00:29.988 --> 03:00:31.830]  I know Savage has got a couple doctorates.
[03:00:31.850 --> 03:00:33.711]  He criticizes vaccines.
[03:00:33.731 --> 03:00:34.432]  He's not stupid.
[03:00:35.192 --> 03:00:36.213]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[03:00:37.614 --> 03:00:40.035]  And it all breaks it down at InfoWars.com.
[03:00:40.055 --> 03:00:42.998]  Very, very exciting to see him getting into all that.
[03:00:43.018 --> 03:00:44.959]  I want to invite Savage back on the show.
[03:00:44.979 --> 03:00:46.180]  He hasn't been on in about six months.
[03:00:47.421 --> 03:00:48.502]  This isn't a game, folks.
[03:00:49.222 --> 03:00:51.584]  This isn't a game by any stretch of the imagination.
[03:00:53.265 --> 03:00:54.126]  Site's not loaded there.
[03:00:57.068 --> 03:01:00.010]  Anyways, trying to get that site to load on television there.
[03:01:00.831 --> 03:01:05.274]  It's just mind-blowing the huge push they've got going to forcibly inoculate
[03:01:06.482 --> 03:01:07.302]  And they mean business.
[03:01:07.362 --> 03:01:08.663]  I mean, this is just such tyranny.
[03:01:10.084 --> 03:01:12.765]  Matt, we're going to get your info and send us some info.
[03:01:12.785 --> 03:01:14.306]  We'll try to get you back on a later date.
[03:01:14.706 --> 03:01:16.627]  But I'd like to see some proof of what you were talking about.
[03:01:16.647 --> 03:01:18.668]  I know it's in the news all the time.
[03:01:18.688 --> 03:01:19.888]  These vaccines are killing people.
[03:01:19.948 --> 03:01:20.669]  It's just amazing.
[03:01:21.229 --> 03:01:22.430]  Let's go to Kelly in Texas.
[03:01:22.470 --> 03:01:23.270]  Kelly, you're on the air.
[03:01:25.591 --> 03:01:26.472]  God bless you, brother.
[03:01:26.892 --> 03:01:31.994]  And I'm a huge supporter of the show, and I'm not standing behind you or in front of you, but right beside you.
[03:01:32.334 --> 03:01:33.095]  Awesome, brother.
[03:01:33.995 --> 03:01:35.596]  I called in, oh, a couple months ago,
[03:01:36.414 --> 03:01:41.697]  I told you about my wife passing because of the soft kill program, you know.
[03:01:42.558 --> 03:01:43.498]  It was pretty horrific.
[03:01:43.578 --> 03:01:51.503]  I mean, she ultimately succumbed to ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, but they first diagnosed her with Guillain-Barre.
[03:01:52.139 --> 03:01:57.042]  And then they upgraded it to CIDP, which is chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.
[03:01:57.442 --> 03:02:01.044]  Yeah, for those that don't know, first they give you the shot, and then you get Guillain-Barre, and they admit it.
[03:02:01.064 --> 03:02:06.547]  But as it starts to kill you, and you're there in a wheelchair on a respirator, then they go, the vaccine had nothing to do with it.
[03:02:07.768 --> 03:02:08.008]  Right.
[03:02:08.448 --> 03:02:14.111]  And to all them listeners out there, if there's any out there listening to this that think this won't get to you, I've got pictures of it.
[03:02:14.131 --> 03:02:20.975]  She went from a perfectly healthy woman at 53 years old when she passed, to going to tube fed in her belly,
[03:02:21.697 --> 03:02:25.185]  Uh, respirator and everything quit working but her brain.
[03:02:25.426 --> 03:02:28.654]  And I remember you said she kept asking baby, baby, when do I get to die?
[03:02:29.636 --> 03:02:30.959]  Yes, she asked me that.
[03:02:31.787 --> 03:02:33.489]  Um, you know, every day almost.
[03:02:33.609 --> 03:02:37.614]  Now, you know, I'd reassured say, well, I don't know even when I'm going to die.
[03:02:37.814 --> 03:02:39.856]  You know, you know, it's time to start telling your stories.
[03:02:40.216 --> 03:02:41.758]  Contact us, send us the photos.
[03:02:41.778 --> 03:02:43.920]  We'll interview you on Skype or you can come here.
[03:02:44.221 --> 03:02:49.026]  It's time to personalize this and show the victims of this extermination operation.
[03:02:49.646 --> 03:02:51.188]  I mean, it is just outrageous.
[03:02:51.248 --> 03:02:53.631]  And now they just want to kill us dead or to hammer.
[03:02:54.656 --> 03:02:57.638]  I mean, doesn't Bill O'Reilly and all of them know they're going to be brought to justice?
[03:02:58.239 --> 03:02:58.839]  Don't they know?
[03:02:58.919 --> 03:03:01.041]  We know this is social engineering.
[03:03:01.101 --> 03:03:02.381]  We know this is social control.
[03:03:02.782 --> 03:03:03.242]  We get it.
[03:03:04.163 --> 03:03:04.483]  We know.
[03:03:04.503 --> 03:03:04.643]  We know.
[03:03:04.703 --> 03:03:05.003]  We know.
[03:03:06.747 --> 03:03:07.227]  I believe it.
[03:03:07.608 --> 03:03:09.449]  I believe what they're doing, it's a war.
[03:03:09.709 --> 03:03:11.490]  I mean, you know, it's unprecedented.
[03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:15.913]  It is a war on America and the people of the West, but they're doing it in Africa as well.
[03:03:15.953 --> 03:03:16.754]  They're murdering us.
[03:03:16.814 --> 03:03:18.035]  I mean, it's a secret program.
[03:03:18.335 --> 03:03:21.357]  It's been declassified partially, and we're not going to put up with it.
[03:03:21.917 --> 03:03:23.939]  Again, send us your contact info at Showtips.
[03:03:23.979 --> 03:03:25.560]  Everybody, we want to get your stories.
[03:03:25.580 --> 03:03:29.122]  We want to tell them, especially those where they admit the vaccine hurt you or killed you.
[03:03:29.622 --> 03:03:30.623]  Thank you, Kelly.
[03:03:30.963 --> 03:03:31.464]  God bless you.
[03:03:31.484 --> 03:03:32.864]  I want to get one more.
[03:03:32.905 --> 03:03:34.946]  And Dave and Bill, I'm sorry, we're out of time.
[03:03:35.046 --> 03:03:36.327]  Ryan in PA, go ahead.
[03:03:37.367 --> 03:03:39.729]  Hi Alex, I'm a longtime listener.
[03:03:39.749 --> 03:03:41.049]  I appreciate all the work you've done.
[03:03:41.069 --> 03:03:45.132]  I've listened to you since 2003 and you're 99% of the time right.
[03:03:46.312 --> 03:03:48.954]  I don't know if I'm even that right, but I sure try to be accurate.
[03:03:48.974 --> 03:03:49.314]  Go ahead.
[03:03:50.554 --> 03:04:00.700]  I sent you an email back in 2009 about my son's vaccine injury and I'm appalled at what the media is not reporting, you know, for vaccine injuries.
[03:04:00.720 --> 03:04:06.063]  You only have three years to file your CDC complaint or you're basically out of luck.
[03:04:07.565 --> 03:04:13.070]  Unfortunately, some of these soft kill vaccines, it may take you three or four years to figure out what happened.
[03:04:14.631 --> 03:04:15.892]  That's why the enemy is so smart.
[03:04:15.912 --> 03:04:17.833]  They hit you with something that takes years to hit.
[03:04:18.934 --> 03:04:20.295]  Also, I have a question for you.
[03:04:21.776 --> 03:04:31.424]  When I was young and naive, just out of college, I got wrapped up in a shop flu vaccine project and I was exposed to a lot of the
[03:04:32.202 --> 03:04:35.005]  I was going to say that before we came back and I've forgotten.
[03:04:35.025 --> 03:04:36.027]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[03:04:36.067 --> 03:04:36.587]  That must be God.
[03:04:52.205 --> 03:04:56.688]  But, remember all the fake news buying, buying all the reporters and Armstrong Williams and all that?
[03:04:57.008 --> 03:04:58.048]  That's going on right now.
[03:04:58.269 --> 03:05:03.151]  There's no doubt they're spending millions paying media, not just with advertising, but paying off reporters.

[03:05:10.016 --> 03:05:10.636]  Hey, guess what?
[03:05:10.656 --> 03:05:11.616]  They become toxic.
[03:05:11.656 --> 03:05:12.037]  They die early.
