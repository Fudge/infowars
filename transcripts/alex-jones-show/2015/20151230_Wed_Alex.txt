[00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:02.911]  Well, it is surreal.
[00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:05.795]  Years ago, we began talking to Cy Hirsch, some on email.
[00:00:07.818 --> 00:00:08.939]  And he, of course, follows our work.
[00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:09.580]  We follow his.
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.802]  Two times Pulitzer Prize winner.
[00:00:11.102 --> 00:00:13.425]  And he said, when my big book comes out in a few years, I'll come on.
[00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:17.291]  Well, he's coming on in the third hour today.
[00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:29.165]  On Military to Military, his new book, how our own military has been standing up to the globalists trying to start World War III and feeding the Russians and Syrians intelligence on al-Qaeda, al-Nusra, ISIS.
[00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:36.227]  Of course, this is old news to our listeners, you heard it here first, but just confirming everything we tell you is in deep research.
[00:00:36.688 --> 00:00:39.149]  Sometimes we make mistakes, very rarely, I wish I was wrong.
[00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.011]  Congress is bought and paid for by foreign interests, it's coming out of the NSA spying on them.
[00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.020]  But that's also because there's a foreign infiltration going on.
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.801]  It's all coming up.
[00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:53.722]  But here is John Bowne's report on Congress, then we'll come back after break.
[00:00:54.743 --> 00:00:58.785]  The year-end disapproval polls of Congress are rolling out.
[00:00:59.085 --> 00:01:05.748]  According to the latest Gallup poll, 82% disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job.
[00:01:06.088 --> 00:01:09.990]  Real Clear Politics congressional job approval is at 75.8% disapproval.
[00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:24.905]  Mainstream media polls even have to accept the boiling anger running its course through America, as the CNN-ORC poll racks up to 75% disapproval and CBS-New York Times is at 74%.
[00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:26.346]  The holiday season isn't
[00:01:27.688 --> 00:01:28.628]  Is that even over yet?
[00:01:28.828 --> 00:01:50.734]  And fresh off of the heels of the treasonous Paul Ryan-led omnibus funding of the Defense Department to the tune of at least $2 billion while ignoring an enemy invasion of the United States, meanwhile dropping a pile of cash on the Sanctuary City's operations being flooded with non-vetted refugees, a ticking time bomb waiting to happen, all paid for by your tax dollars.
[00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:55.875]  Is it any surprise that the career corporate politicians that have occupied the nation's capital
[00:01:56.055 --> 00:02:03.562]  would start floating their latest bonehead idea from their arrogant bubble as if anybody in this country actually accepts it.
[00:02:03.942 --> 00:02:09.968]  It seems to me that we'll have to borrow additional money from China in order to run this war.
[00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:11.630]  So let's have a war tax.
[00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:31.356]  Now, more idiotic rhetoric from the left as Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who in addition to authorizing Obama's unconstitutional authorization for use of military force, minus the ground troops, says the Congress from hell should now levy a new tax on Americans to pay for military action against the Islamic State.
[00:02:31.496 --> 00:02:32.897]  How are we going to pay for it?
[00:02:33.418 --> 00:02:38.923]  All the previous wars, as you referenced, before Iraq and Afghanistan had a dedicated war surtax.
[00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:47.171]  And I think that's one way we could fairly pay for it with a small surtax that exempted active-duty military families and veterans.
[00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:49.293]  But there's other ways we could pay for it.
[00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:52.656]  We just can't keep going without even discussing it.
[00:02:52.796 --> 00:02:53.297]  That's right.
[00:02:53.557 --> 00:03:04.348]  The little boys and their brand new shiny toys over at the Pentagon need more of your tax dollars to fund another one of their blatant fake wars with an enemy they created and support.
[00:03:04.468 --> 00:03:12.596]  Maybe we should send our war tax dollars to Putin, as he did more damage to ISIS in three days than the United States did in one year.
[00:03:12.997 --> 00:03:16.120]  Vocative reports the daily tab for fighting ISIS
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.540]  I think?
[00:03:32.748 --> 00:03:33.509]  Which the U.S.
[00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.393]  has employed since August of 2014 to pound Islamic State targets.
[00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:44.219]  Munitions, logistics, and operational support accounted for the remaining costs, according to the Pentagon.
[00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:50.705]  Despite spending billions, the air campaign has failed to weaken the Islamic State, according to intelligence officials.
[00:03:51.045 --> 00:03:56.448]  A defense official told the Associated Press, we've seen no meaningful degradation in their numbers.
[00:03:56.748 --> 00:04:02.071]  He cited intelligence estimates that put the Islamic State's total strength at somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000.
[00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:03.732]  Virtually the same number as last August.
[00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:08.234]  When the airstrikes began.
[00:04:08.674 --> 00:04:13.138]  Face it, you sell out ideologue suits bumbling around the District of Criminals.
[00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:21.384]  The poll numbers and an average of black-budgeted 1.6 trillion in annual never-ending war costs don't lie.
[00:04:21.724 --> 00:04:30.190]  The days of wagging the dog for the assumed idiotic taxpayers you've robbed year in year out is coming to a screeching halt.
[00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.332]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:04:37.364 --> 00:04:38.725]  Are you looking for affordable housing?
[00:04:38.825 --> 00:04:40.686]  Well, check out these headlines.
[00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:43.468]  60,000 New Yorkers sign up for tiny house development.
[00:04:43.568 --> 00:04:45.509]  265 square foot apartments.
[00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.031]  But would you pay $3,000 a month for this?
[00:04:48.531 --> 00:04:52.954]  Next, inside NYC's impossibly small 100 square foot apartment.
[00:04:53.154 --> 00:04:54.815]  It only goes for $2,800 a month.
[00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:57.477]  Or how about life in a 90 square foot box?
[00:04:57.657 --> 00:05:02.560]  Woman's apartment takes cramped New York living to the extreme, but she's living in the West Village for just $7.75 a month.
[00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:04.842]  And here's one out of New York.
[00:05:33.661 --> 00:05:36.683]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:05:37.263 --> 00:05:40.465]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:05:40.765 --> 00:05:48.769]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:54.012]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:15.706]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:46.117]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[00:06:46.317 --> 00:06:52.602]  And it's all possible because in the hustle and bustle of daily life, we forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[00:06:52.822 --> 00:06:54.344]  The numbers are staggering.

[00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:04.490]  That's $41 billion taken directly from our back pockets.

[00:08:00.356 --> 00:08:04.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, what I call InfoWars Live.
[00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:09.124]  We just kicked off one of the final transmissions of 2015.
[00:08:09.485 --> 00:08:15.310]  It is the 30th day of December, 2015, on this Wednesday broadcast.
[00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:23.497]  Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Seymour Hersh exposing what many experts have called a soft coup by the Pentagon.
[00:08:24.278 --> 00:08:33.844]  Trying to block the neocons and the Obama crowd from openly backing Al Qaeda groups all over the Middle East to bring in their Wahhabist Sharia law tyranny.
[00:08:35.005 --> 00:08:37.506]  That is in the third hour today.
[00:08:38.147 --> 00:08:46.632]  Former editor, the editor of the Wall Street Journal, former head of policy, Department of Treasury, the father of Reaganomics, will be popping in for 30 minutes as well.
[00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:51.415]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts wrote a very important article dealing with the fact
[00:08:52.793 --> 00:08:57.176]  That Donald Trump is challenging the establishment and they are coming after him.
[00:08:57.977 --> 00:09:03.221]  So that's going to be looked at coming up in the second hour today.
[00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:04.883]  We'll also try to open the phones up.
[00:09:05.743 --> 00:09:16.091]  There is a big Daily Beast article, that of course is Newsweek, that's getting picked up by the talking heads on the controlled corporate globalist press.
[00:09:17.369 --> 00:09:30.313]  Demonizing Donald Trump and Matt Drudge and saying how horrible it is that Matt Drudge has been following Donald Trump and claiming he's being supportive of Donald Trump.
[00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:37.615]  Well, I'll let Matt Drudge speak for himself, but Donald Trump looks like he's the only candidate that can beat Hillary Clinton.
[00:09:38.736 --> 00:09:41.877]  And so, do you want Hillary Clinton in office?
[00:09:43.052 --> 00:09:44.794]  Donald Trump just gets better and better.
[00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:50.999]  He's come out and said he's sick of Obama being on vacation up to four months a year, worse than any other president before.
[00:09:51.239 --> 00:09:52.480]  I was a big critic of Bush for it.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.662]  Obama's almost done double what Bush did.
[00:09:55.783 --> 00:10:07.473]  As he was about to go to Hawaii for another month-long vacation, he made the announcement that, oh, the most important thing I'll be doing, quote, is watching the new Star Wars movie.
[00:10:07.493 --> 00:10:10.596]  I guess the president gets an advance copy or doesn't have to go to the theater.
[00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:18.509]  They're having press briefings with, you know, R2-D2 and C-3PO at the White House.
[00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.993]  Just nothing but pop garbage.
[00:10:21.714 --> 00:10:28.504]  Even liberal comedians are coming out, like David Spade and saying, you know, you need to not be on reality TV.
[00:10:28.524 --> 00:10:29.064]  You need to not...
[00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:31.984]  Be so degraded as the President.
[00:10:32.024 --> 00:10:33.145]  That's the whole point.
[00:10:33.586 --> 00:10:34.586]  Is to degrade the country.
[00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:36.728]  And to divert people off into mindless garbage.
[00:10:36.748 --> 00:10:38.029]  But even liberals are getting it.
[00:10:38.309 --> 00:10:42.453]  Even liberal members of Congress, David Knight covered this yesterday, are saying Hillary destroyed Libya.
[00:10:43.053 --> 00:10:44.374]  Launched the attack on Syria.
[00:10:47.517 --> 00:10:52.121]  Obama will spend $470,000 a day while he is in Hawaii on this vacation.
[00:10:53.102 --> 00:10:54.963]  And again, there's a lot bigger stuff going on.
[00:10:55.323 --> 00:10:59.367]  But it illustrates, as Trump said, while we're in a major war
[00:11:00.382 --> 00:11:12.934]  With ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra, same group that is attacking five or six countries, or more actually, it's up to ten, but currently five or six the last month have been attacked in Africa.
[00:11:13.175 --> 00:11:24.726]  Hundreds dead, Middle East, thousands dead every month, attacking Syria, attacking Libya, overthrowing it, attacking and overthrowing for a time Egypt, our government backing it.
[00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:27.984]  This is order out of chaos.
[00:11:28.024 --> 00:11:31.912]  This is globalism using America to destabilize the world as well as NATO.
[00:11:33.365 --> 00:11:37.667]  And Trump comes out and says, you need to be at the White House fighting ISIS.
[00:11:38.327 --> 00:11:41.948]  You need to be working hard like a lot of other presidents.
[00:11:42.008 --> 00:11:48.171]  I mean, Bill Clinton was a pretty bad guy doing horrible stuff, but he reportedly worked about 15 hours a day carrying on his evil agenda.
[00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:52.712]  People like Nixon worked up to 18 to 20 hours a day.
[00:11:53.053 --> 00:11:55.193]  And by the way, actually believed he was trying to help the country.
[00:11:55.473 --> 00:11:56.474]  That's been well documented.
[00:11:57.148 --> 00:12:01.631]  He was a twisted guy, had problems, but he was a saint.
[00:12:01.752 --> 00:12:02.672]  A saint!
[00:12:03.613 --> 00:12:09.918]  That's why the establishment took him down with a Naval Intelligence and a CIA officers over at the Washington Bilderberg Post.
[00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:18.684]  And by the way, Nixon did a lot of bad stuff, but he actually tried to be president, and they said, uh-uh, just like Kennedy tried to be president, and they said, no.
[00:12:20.586 --> 00:12:21.887]  You die, is what they said.
[00:12:22.187 --> 00:12:24.489]  Well, they had a soft coup, basically, on Nixon.
[00:12:25.526 --> 00:12:26.667]  And you could argue he deserved it.
[00:12:26.687 --> 00:12:27.547]  He did some bad things.
[00:12:28.107 --> 00:12:42.935]  Nothing compared to what Barack Hussein Obama... In fact, even Jonathan Turley, other liberal constitutional lawyers have said, Obama has done more than Bush by an order of three times.
[00:12:43.535 --> 00:12:44.876]  Three times worse.
[00:12:45.917 --> 00:12:49.659]  Three times worse in violating the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.320]  That was his job.
[00:12:51.661 --> 00:12:53.201]  Put the liberals to sleep.
[00:12:53.702 --> 00:12:56.763]  Of course an attack on liberty is going to come from a liberal angle.
[00:12:57.363 --> 00:13:05.747]  Because traditionally, American liberals were more like Thomas Jefferson and really did stand up for basic human rights and freedoms and due process.
[00:13:07.608 --> 00:13:09.429]  That's what you could expect from a Democratic Party.
[00:13:10.169 --> 00:13:11.070]  Not anymore, folks.
[00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:17.253]  Fascistic with a communist icing is the best way to describe it.
[00:13:18.294 --> 00:13:23.718]  And they are freaking out all over the media saying it could be Matt Drudge that gets Donald Trump elected.
[00:13:23.778 --> 00:13:27.922]  Well, this is what Matt Drudge is really able to do as the number one news site in the world.
[00:13:30.264 --> 00:13:36.008]  To show people a mosaic of really what's going on, linking to the establishment and what people actually said.
[00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:42.914]  They'll come out and say that, you know, Trump said he hates all Mexicans and thinks they should all be deported and then Drudge will just link to the actual clip where he didn't say that.
[00:13:46.371 --> 00:13:52.474]  So, Drudge just brings up things that aren't in the establishment narrative, that don't go along with their talking points.
[00:13:53.494 --> 00:13:57.616]  And so, then what Drudge puts out ends up becoming a major talking point.
[00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:07.200]  Because the slaves in mainstream media have to follow talking points they're given, they don't even know how to come up with their own views of the world, their own talking points.
[00:14:08.578 --> 00:14:10.398]  They don't even see through their own rose color darkly.
[00:14:10.438 --> 00:14:11.079]  None of us are perfect.
[00:14:11.239 --> 00:14:17.220]  They just go with whatever is handed down to them that is the supposed angle or narrative.
[00:14:19.941 --> 00:14:21.361]  And so they then go.
[00:14:21.381 --> 00:14:27.103]  I mean, how many times do you see photos in the background of the Washington Post, New York Times, LA Times, MSNBC, CNN, Fox News?
[00:14:27.303 --> 00:14:29.943]  There's the Drudge Report on a TV screen or on computers.
[00:14:31.784 --> 00:14:36.585]  They don't even know how to go through their own email or even go to like 10 or 15 other sites or go to foreign sites.
[00:14:37.645 --> 00:14:39.987]  They just go to drudge, which is good.
[00:14:40.828 --> 00:14:52.140]  But imagine, to them it's so fantastical that someone's linking to Japanese and South African and Russian and Mexican news and alternative media or some lady who shot a cell phone video.
[00:14:53.783 --> 00:14:56.184]  Without commentary, just, here it is, what do you think?
[00:14:56.964 --> 00:15:01.266]  Here's ten articles about, you know, cameras going up on street corners that face scan you.
[00:15:01.827 --> 00:15:03.187]  Oh, you crazy conspiracy theorist!
[00:15:03.627 --> 00:15:07.989]  All he's doing is linking to mainstream media, but he's showing, connecting the dots, how it's rolling out.
[00:15:08.309 --> 00:15:17.073]  Or all these Pentagon people admitting robots will replace all combat troops within ten years, and then he links to top scientists in mainstream news, saying we're going to be taken over by computers.
[00:15:17.293 --> 00:15:20.575]  They go, look at Drudge, fear-mongering out about robot takeovers.
[00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:24.717]  Oh, it was linked to a spectrum of it to show you it's a trend.
[00:15:26.138 --> 00:15:30.080]  But it's the end of the establishment if you start thinking for yourself.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:35.182]  And I'm going to get into all the news, but it's important to look at this because they attack Drudge, they attack Trump.
[00:15:35.202 --> 00:15:41.786]  Let me show people the article of your TV viewer, Infowars.com forward slash show to find the free video feeds.
[00:15:43.907 --> 00:15:46.288]  And it says, Make America Great Again.
[00:15:46.388 --> 00:15:50.050]  And they stick a Drudge hat on Donald Trump.
[00:15:51.681 --> 00:16:04.475]  And of course Trump's committing a war crime, according to the Globalist and the Infowar, by admitting the plan is to not make America great, the plan is to slowly suck us dry while our blood, sweat and tears builds the big tax-exempt global government.
[00:16:06.417 --> 00:16:10.161]  And the article goes on, why is Matt Drudge boosting Donald Trump?
[00:16:11.684 --> 00:16:14.546]  Donald Trump hit the zeitgeist six, eight months ago.
[00:16:15.066 --> 00:16:18.808]  Donald Trump is saying what the American people are feeling and witnessing.
[00:16:19.048 --> 00:16:20.249]  And Drudge is feeling the same thing.
[00:16:20.429 --> 00:16:21.970]  So he's just dialing into it.
[00:16:24.053 --> 00:16:26.534]  But they act like, oh, it's all Drudge's fault.
[00:16:26.634 --> 00:16:28.234]  Oh, it's such a terrible thing.
[00:16:28.294 --> 00:16:31.055]  See, if he could just be dealt with, and let me tell you where this is going.
[00:16:31.455 --> 00:16:46.078]  This is going in campaign finance reform, as multiple members of the FCC board have said on both sides, that they are going to try next year to pass laws and get the Supreme Court to rule that Matt Drudge
[00:16:47.403 --> 00:16:50.264]  cannot even exist because he's political.
[00:16:50.624 --> 00:16:52.044]  Well, everybody is political.
[00:16:52.104 --> 00:16:53.285]  Everybody has their free speech.
[00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:58.566]  He should be able to link to a clip of Obama saying that there's 57 states.
[00:17:01.927 --> 00:17:06.048]  But see, that's where all of this is going, and he had a Supreme Court justice tell him.
[00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:14.430]  Next year, we've been told that basically they have the votes, they're gonna rule to shut you down.
[00:17:15.888 --> 00:17:18.110]  And by the way, that means talk radio, and that means this show.
[00:17:18.331 --> 00:17:34.829]  So Drudge comes here, comes out of the shadows, after all the behind-the-scenes harassment he's gone through, and I'll just leave it at that, comes on this show, in the shadows, right over there, 20 feet away, behind the cameras, and lays all this out, and they make fun of it.
[00:17:39.352 --> 00:17:51.783]  It goes on, the public evidence we have is the big and very rare interview Drudge gave back in October to wing nut, oh look they use a term like wing nut, how original, radio host Alex Jones where he delivered gems like this one.
[00:17:52.223 --> 00:18:00.090]  You've got to be the greatest you can be now before this country is so completely altered and we're left with Hillary's brain in the Oval Office in a jar.
[00:18:00.611 --> 00:18:02.352]  Because that's what we're getting.
[00:18:02.592 --> 00:18:04.875]  She is old, she is sick, she is not a contender.
[00:18:05.933 --> 00:18:10.475]  They're making her a contender with these propped up Saturday Night Live things.
[00:18:10.535 --> 00:18:12.376]  It's like a head on a stick.
[00:18:13.716 --> 00:18:17.398]  And the Today Show, a head on a stick.
[00:18:17.478 --> 00:18:22.960]  She is not viable, vibrant leader for this country of 300, including the illegal 380 million Americans.
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.741]  So the media is trying to put us to sleep.
[00:18:26.963 --> 00:18:29.725]  And then he goes on to warn about their coming for our free speech.
[00:18:29.765 --> 00:18:30.585]  We've got a rally.
[00:18:30.605 --> 00:18:31.385]  We've got to take action.
[00:18:31.405 --> 00:18:37.249]  This is the biggest guy when it comes to actual power in the U.S.
[00:18:37.309 --> 00:18:39.110]  media, arguably the world media.
[00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.691]  I mean, who's more influential to put a big story out and get it covered?
[00:18:42.731 --> 00:18:43.532]  Vladimir Putin?
[00:18:43.912 --> 00:18:44.653]  Matt Drudge?
[00:18:45.873 --> 00:18:47.874]  Then what, a Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones after that?
[00:18:49.355 --> 00:18:51.896]  And thank God I'm not one of the very top people.
[00:18:52.457 --> 00:18:54.318]  It's scary enough up at these heights, believe me.
[00:18:55.185 --> 00:19:00.168]  It's like floating around at 10,000 feet in a hot air balloon, and you got gremlins crawling around on the top, poking it with needles.
[00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.852]  Literally scurrying around everywhere, step on them every day.
[00:19:04.872 --> 00:19:08.414]  I'm like climbing around on top of the balloon, trying to swat them off.
[00:19:08.474 --> 00:19:12.757]  I mean, it's just, the public's like zombies wandering around, having no idea this huge war is going on.
[00:19:13.057 --> 00:19:15.179]  Oh, I'm a wingnut, is that why Cy Hirsch is coming on?
[00:19:15.199 --> 00:19:18.541]  Is that why the former chief editor of the Wall Street Journal is about to come on?
[00:19:19.021 --> 00:19:19.782]  Oh, is that why...
[00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:29.023]  Donald Trump came on, is that why you people just think you can just lazily throw out a term, demonize people, and then no one's gonna listen?
[00:19:29.243 --> 00:19:32.087]  You're so discredited, all it does is make everybody tune in.
[00:19:32.368 --> 00:19:33.149]  So keep it up!
[00:19:33.429 --> 00:19:36.293]  Send what little audience you have left, Daily Beast, to me!
[00:19:37.663 --> 00:19:44.368]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[00:19:44.729 --> 00:19:48.392]  It caught me totally by surprise, and it involves FEMA.
[00:19:48.732 --> 00:19:51.714]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[00:19:52.135 --> 00:19:57.219]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[00:19:57.819 --> 00:20:01.841]  Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again.
[00:20:02.182 --> 00:20:07.785]  But be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is, they must know something we don't.

[00:23:58.734 --> 00:23:59.414]  Central.
[00:23:59.814 --> 00:24:00.335]  We're here live.
[00:24:00.595 --> 00:24:02.136]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:02.676 --> 00:24:03.757]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:24:03.777 --> 00:24:10.241]  All right, I want to burrow into the news at the start of the next segment, but this one is short, six minutes long.
[00:24:10.261 --> 00:24:21.928]  I want to talk about the real cosmology of the world, which is in the history books, which is in common sense, which is in all the basic literature.
[00:24:22.816 --> 00:24:23.997]  Both fiction and non-fiction.
[00:24:24.017 --> 00:24:25.217]  We know how humans operate.
[00:24:25.577 --> 00:24:26.798]  We know the basic rules.
[00:24:27.458 --> 00:24:30.119]  We know what our species has done, generation after generation.
[00:24:33.501 --> 00:24:38.003]  And you watch mainstream media, it is at war with common sense.
[00:24:39.484 --> 00:24:40.144]  And why is that?
[00:24:41.545 --> 00:24:48.728]  Because our forebearers weren't perfect, but they lived closer to the ground, closer to the weather, closer to the bandits on the road.
[00:24:51.735 --> 00:24:54.957]  They weren't inserted into this high-tech media bubble.
[00:24:56.497 --> 00:25:02.200]  And they would never put up with the basic things that are going on all around us today.
[00:25:04.941 --> 00:25:07.883]  And that's why they've tried to arrest the development of so many Westerners.
[00:25:08.343 --> 00:25:11.645]  It's why they've tried to make people cynical and stupid and uninformed.
[00:25:12.025 --> 00:25:18.548]  And then the political managing class, like trained SEALs, just say, wingnut, crazy, tinfoil hat.
[00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:23.793]  Did that work five years ago when we exposed you were using Al-Qaeda in Libya?
[00:25:24.394 --> 00:25:25.895]  Did it work three years ago in Syria?
[00:25:26.315 --> 00:25:27.136]  Did it work in Egypt?
[00:25:27.516 --> 00:25:27.676]  No.
[00:25:28.998 --> 00:25:30.939]  I mean, we report real things.
[00:25:31.319 --> 00:25:35.443]  We have real high-level military intelligence operatives, whistleblowers on.
[00:25:36.504 --> 00:25:38.345]  And others do this as well, thank God.
[00:25:41.988 --> 00:25:44.530]  And we absolutely devastate your operations.
[00:25:45.271 --> 00:25:47.532]  And then you respond by calling us wingnuts again.
[00:25:48.533 --> 00:25:48.833]  Okay.
[00:25:49.969 --> 00:25:51.550]  Oh my gosh, I'm in third grade.
[00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.431]  You just called me a booger face.
[00:25:53.992 --> 00:25:54.732]  What am I going to do?
[00:25:54.752 --> 00:25:57.294]  I'm a 42-year-old man.
[00:26:00.736 --> 00:26:02.317]  Committed to defending this republic.
[00:26:03.277 --> 00:26:04.778]  And you are calling me names.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:10.102]  And I illustrate that for everybody just to look at how pathetic our enemies are.
[00:26:10.742 --> 00:26:14.785]  Thank God they're so pathetic, but they do have our tax money and they are on top of us.
[00:26:16.732 --> 00:26:18.773]  They weigh about 400 pounds, but they don't have any muscles.
[00:26:19.493 --> 00:26:22.034]  We can just roll them off of us and they're not going to be able to get back up.
[00:26:22.334 --> 00:26:23.575]  They'll be like a beetle in the sun.
[00:26:25.616 --> 00:26:27.636]  But you gotta decide you want to get them off of you.
[00:26:30.417 --> 00:26:36.620]  Now, it is so unprecedented what's happening at this point.
[00:26:39.167 --> 00:26:47.555]  And Obama's nonchalant stuff, going out there to Hawaii and all the rest of it, acting like he doesn't care and acting like everything's fine, that's Obama hiding out.
[00:26:47.835 --> 00:26:51.399]  He is working 12-14 hours a day while he's out there to destroy this country.
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.182]  He's making the phone calls to get the guns.
[00:26:55.609 --> 00:26:58.971]  They're coming after everything this next year.
[00:26:59.292 --> 00:27:00.773]  The free speech, the guns.
[00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:09.519]  I've got massive mainstream alternative articles, you name it, about the financial meltdown and derivatives being much bigger than they were in 2008.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.842]  Governments are digging in right now.
[00:27:14.922 --> 00:27:18.685]  Much of the world's already in global depression or deep recession.
[00:27:20.166 --> 00:27:22.948]  It's like we're on a roller coaster and the ride's starting and we're going,
[00:27:25.785 --> 00:27:26.886]  And you're kind of to the top, man.
[00:27:26.906 --> 00:27:29.247]  We're like, I don't know quite when this thing lets loose.
[00:27:29.287 --> 00:27:35.309]  Never been on this roller coaster before, but hold on to your hats, people.
[00:27:39.011 --> 00:27:45.194]  And on this roller coaster, if you hunker down and hide out, they win.
[00:27:46.774 --> 00:27:47.695]  On this roller coaster,
[00:27:49.116 --> 00:27:56.520]  Things become very, very fluid politically, and they want to make the changes politically during the organized crises that they're going to ride to victory, they believe.
[00:27:57.341 --> 00:27:59.922]  We've got to hit them and hit them hard in the Info War at every level.
[00:28:00.483 --> 00:28:01.763]  And they're going to be bold, folks.
[00:28:02.384 --> 00:28:06.486]  They're going to have big hack attacks and take down huge parts of the web in the name of taking it over.
[00:28:06.966 --> 00:28:14.530]  They're openly announcing how they're going to bring in the internet taxation, campaign finance law, FCC declared this year, control of the internet.
[00:28:15.431 --> 00:28:16.772]  We told you next year they're coming.
[00:28:17.012 --> 00:28:18.633]  The Supreme Court's got the votes.
[00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:23.990]  They're coming.
[00:28:25.672 --> 00:28:28.094]  I'll quote Lord of the Rings.
[00:28:30.276 --> 00:28:33.819]  When they're in the mines of Moria, drums, drums in the deep.
[00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:37.242]  And the drums are coming.
[00:28:38.543 --> 00:28:43.387]  You can even look out the door as we slam it shut and see the shadows on the wall of the tunnel.
[00:28:44.728 --> 00:28:47.630]  Any second now, rounding that corner, here they come.
[00:28:48.371 --> 00:28:51.554]  Everything you've already seen was just the advance guard.
[00:28:52.668 --> 00:28:55.689]  Scoping a shout, getting ready, infiltrating, preparing.
[00:28:57.329 --> 00:29:01.730]  They're going to turn loose their socialist and communist forces to blow up federal buildings, you name it.
[00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.770]  They're going to shoot patriots, throw our bodies at the scenes.
[00:29:05.651 --> 00:29:06.811]  I'm telling you how they operate.
[00:29:07.851 --> 00:29:08.811]  Get ready, they're coming.
[00:29:09.731 --> 00:29:12.092]  They're going to start killing cops in every town.
[00:29:13.112 --> 00:29:14.452]  They're going to try to run a revolution.
[00:29:16.373 --> 00:29:17.493]  It's hardcore, folks.
[00:29:19.474 --> 00:29:22.196]  You are witnessing the Republic in the battle for its life.
[00:29:22.656 --> 00:29:23.257]  It starts now.
[00:29:24.017 --> 00:29:24.938]  It starts now.
[00:29:26.579 --> 00:29:27.500]  We're on the march.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.601]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:33.204]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:36.014 --> 00:31:40.355]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:40.675 --> 00:31:45.756]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[00:31:48.918 --> 00:31:53.921]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:31:54.341 --> 00:31:56.623]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:32:08.222 --> 00:32:10.323]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:32:10.443 --> 00:32:15.165]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:32:15.425 --> 00:32:17.065]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[00:32:17.125 --> 00:32:18.566]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:32:18.706 --> 00:32:21.927]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:32:22.187 --> 00:32:24.028]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:32:24.188 --> 00:32:25.088]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:32:25.108 --> 00:32:26.068]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:32:26.308 --> 00:32:28.169]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:32:28.289 --> 00:32:33.871]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.240]  Here they come.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.162]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:03.262 --> 00:33:04.002]  Watch your six.
[00:33:04.322 --> 00:33:05.402]  Alex Jones.
[00:33:05.422 --> 00:33:06.943]  Get in position.
[00:33:07.063 --> 00:33:08.043]  It's the info war.
[00:33:10.244 --> 00:33:12.244]  Truth trumps fraud.
[00:33:16.885 --> 00:33:19.066]  Somebody's gotta be willing to carry the ball.
[00:33:21.227 --> 00:33:26.028]  If a few good men and women don't, every civilization falls into barbarism.
[00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:32.053]  It falls into a culture of conquest, not a culture of innovation.
[00:33:33.654 --> 00:33:40.119]  It is the culture of innovation and the renaissance and free will that is destined to take us to the stars.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.862]  But we have to take that destiny in our hands and in our hearts.
[00:33:47.324 --> 00:33:54.910]  And we have to carry out the important work of defying the control freaks and the tyrants.
[00:33:58.109 --> 00:34:02.491]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, dedicated to defending human liberty.
[00:34:02.511 --> 00:34:12.654]  And I want to thank you all for joining us and trying in this college of ideas to work towards solutions and ideas that can challenge the fairy tale the globalists are trying to sell us.
[00:34:13.654 --> 00:34:16.295]  That humans are ugly and bad and are a failed species.
[00:34:16.735 --> 00:34:19.016]  But the end of humanity is soon upon us.
[00:34:19.656 --> 00:34:24.758]  We should crawl into a hole and just die, giving the world to the globalists to become gods.
[00:34:26.299 --> 00:34:27.319]  There are no gods at all.
[00:34:28.749 --> 00:34:33.951]  Coming up, Senator Paul, appalled by NSA spying on Congress.
[00:34:35.491 --> 00:34:45.154]  Notice, and I don't think Paul's doing this because he's a smart guy, but you notice they expose the NSA spying that is constitutional.
[00:34:46.114 --> 00:34:52.236]  And they don't expose all the other programs where everything that Congress does is tracked by more than 16 agencies.
[00:34:53.997 --> 00:34:56.978]  The NSA is spying on foreign communiques
[00:34:58.692 --> 00:35:04.315]  Voice memos, text messages, phone calls from foreign countries.
[00:35:06.556 --> 00:35:08.537]  And Israel doesn't like that.
[00:35:09.737 --> 00:35:16.260]  And so Israel has operatives in the media putting, I'm not an enemy of Israel, but it's my job to tell you what's going on.
[00:35:17.981 --> 00:35:25.745]  And I don't want any foreign government spying on Congress because they can then blackmail them.
[00:35:25.785 --> 00:35:27.906]  And Israel does that big time.
[00:35:29.884 --> 00:35:32.165]  And Israel has different political parties over there.
[00:35:35.547 --> 00:35:45.713]  And if I have one big beef with the general Israel lobby, it's not even the three billion in foreign aid a year, that's chicken feed.
[00:35:46.873 --> 00:35:48.354]  My issue is Israel.
[00:35:50.355 --> 00:35:56.379]  Basically every political party over there lobbies and gives money to gun control groups in our country to take our guns.
[00:35:57.233 --> 00:36:01.376]  When Israel lets any citizen that wants it have a gun to protect themselves.
[00:36:03.477 --> 00:36:06.559]  And I'm tired of foreign governments lobbying.
[00:36:07.159 --> 00:36:09.701]  England, the UK, lobbies and gives money to get our guns.
[00:36:10.562 --> 00:36:12.843]  I'm tired of all these foreign countries in our business.
[00:36:14.184 --> 00:36:15.385]  You know who isn't in our business?
[00:36:15.405 --> 00:36:15.985]  The Russians.
[00:36:16.706 --> 00:36:18.567]  You know who the media tells us is in our business?
[00:36:20.048 --> 00:36:20.608]  The Russians.
[00:36:21.789 --> 00:36:23.150]  More loads of bull.
[00:36:24.189 --> 00:36:27.331]  But there's the rest of the story, and it's just so irritating to see it in the news.
[00:36:27.751 --> 00:36:39.096]  The only reason you're hearing about it is because there are patriots in the NSA who are pointing out that foreign governments are spying on Congress.
[00:36:42.398 --> 00:36:42.718]  U.S.
[00:36:42.838 --> 00:36:45.419]  spy net on Israel snares Congress.
[00:36:45.639 --> 00:36:46.620]  Talk about spin.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.400]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:36:49.041 --> 00:36:49.601]  That's coming up.
[00:36:49.621 --> 00:36:52.483]  We'll talk about that with Cy Hirsch.
[00:36:54.212 --> 00:36:58.055]  But first off, Israeli commander claims that U.S.
[00:36:58.275 --> 00:37:01.178]  secretly evacuated ISIS leaders to safety.
[00:37:02.098 --> 00:37:13.508]  Now, what they use is Merck grips, sheep dip, seals, green berets, others, in the State Department to carry this out.
[00:37:14.128 --> 00:37:20.974]  We know about this, because it's not a claim, it's a Steve Watson article at Infowars.com, because this is a long-standing operation.
[00:37:22.113 --> 00:37:47.561]  And the reason we know about it is because people like Anthony Schaeffer, back in 2002, went public to the San Francisco Chronicle, as well as another special forces full colonel, he was a lieutenant colonel at the time, pointing out that thousands of Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders were flown out to safety
[00:37:50.868 --> 00:37:57.370]  Before the invasions even really began, and they only bombed conscripts in the front lines, it was a totally staged war.
[00:37:59.851 --> 00:38:00.571]  Totally staged.
[00:38:02.771 --> 00:38:08.593]  Now the conscripts didn't know that they weren't fighting for Allah, but I'm not just going to make that claim.
[00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:10.634]  Here's the article, Infowars.com.
[00:38:12.334 --> 00:38:15.175]  We're going to go over it in a moment, but let me just give you background.
[00:38:15.195 --> 00:38:16.335]  See, this is how my brain works.
[00:38:16.375 --> 00:38:18.636]  The instant I saw this this morning on Infowars.com.
[00:38:21.181 --> 00:38:26.223]  We'll actually pull this up, because when it printed it, it actually erased it, the headline.
[00:38:26.503 --> 00:38:27.684]  The Airlift of Evil.
[00:38:28.284 --> 00:38:29.204]  NBC News.
[00:38:29.364 --> 00:38:29.685]  See that?
[00:38:29.705 --> 00:38:33.426]  We'll actually pull it up online, because again, the printer put a box over it.
[00:38:34.527 --> 00:38:35.847]  Airlift of Evil.
[00:38:38.968 --> 00:38:39.729]  NBC News.
[00:38:39.769 --> 00:38:40.089]  There it is.
[00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:48.553]  The United States took the unprecedented step this week of demanding that foreign airlines provide information on passenger boarding planes to America.
[00:38:48.993 --> 00:39:04.256]  Yet in the past week, a half-dozen or more Pakistani Air Force cargo planes landed in the Taliban-held city of Kunduz and evacuated to Pakistan hundreds, it turned out it was thousands, of non-Afghan soldiers who fought alongside the Taliban and even Al Qaeda against the United States.
[00:39:04.636 --> 00:39:05.676]  What's wrong with this picture?
[00:39:06.596 --> 00:39:07.837]  See no evil in denial.
[00:39:08.057 --> 00:39:08.837]  That's all the spin.
[00:39:08.877 --> 00:39:10.297]  It came out later, it was thousands.
[00:39:12.404 --> 00:39:15.526]  And they basically evacuated the Akkani network out of the country.
[00:39:17.408 --> 00:39:17.908]  Here's another one.
[00:39:18.088 --> 00:39:19.049]  Do you realize the U.S.
[00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:20.510]  funded and trained ISIS?
[00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:21.291]  There's another report.
[00:39:22.992 --> 00:39:23.232]  U.S.
[00:39:23.292 --> 00:39:27.195]  airdrops weapons to ISIS as Iraq Army makes gains.
[00:39:28.877 --> 00:39:29.357]  Confirmed.
[00:39:29.377 --> 00:39:31.639]  Benghazi was cover up for arms transfer to Al-Qaeda.
[00:39:32.725 --> 00:39:35.768]  Ex-DIA chief, Obama willfully allowed rise of ISIS.
[00:39:35.969 --> 00:39:37.070]  That headline's not even strong enough.
[00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:38.812]  I'm rolling that daily, I'm not bad.
[00:39:40.133 --> 00:39:44.878]  The general, Flynn, said that they were ordered to do it consciously.
[00:39:47.181 --> 00:39:48.122]  Newly declassified U.S.
[00:39:48.162 --> 00:39:48.963]  government documents.
[00:39:49.023 --> 00:39:50.564]  The West supported the creation of ISIS.
[00:39:52.106 --> 00:39:52.666]  Former D.I.A.
[00:39:52.687 --> 00:39:53.327]  director, U.S.
[00:39:53.367 --> 00:39:54.669]  made willful decision to support ISIS.
[00:39:55.902 --> 00:40:01.805]  So, here's this current story about Iraq commander claims the U.S.
[00:40:01.845 --> 00:40:03.806]  secretly evacuated ISIS leaders to safety.
[00:40:04.626 --> 00:40:13.330]  But when you say the U.S., you mean the criminal State Department elements that are part of the long-standing coup over this country since 1913 of the financial system.
[00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:18.432]  Now they're just mopping up the states, mopping up the families, mopping up what was left of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:40:18.652 --> 00:40:21.694]  I mean, America, our republic, was a big elephant to eat.
[00:40:36.997 --> 00:40:38.058]  You know what I keep thinking about?
[00:40:40.099 --> 00:40:42.201]  What keeps jumping into my mind while I'm covering all this other news?
[00:40:43.002 --> 00:40:53.470]  The fact that the day after I said, Trump, you need to go after Hillary for lying and saying she was on the ground and being shot at and attacked in Serbia and it was all lies.
[00:40:56.492 --> 00:40:59.314]  And then I know for a fact that was relayed directly to Trump and he did it the next day.
[00:40:59.334 --> 00:41:00.835]  It wasn't on Meet the Press or something.
[00:41:02.356 --> 00:41:03.377]  And I'm not on a power trip.
[00:41:03.397 --> 00:41:06.560]  I'm just sitting here realizing what will happen if Trump goes after this.
[00:41:11.383 --> 00:41:19.529]  I know Trump's really smart, it's just surreal that we can write an article, drugs links to it, Trump retweets it.
[00:41:24.092 --> 00:41:37.362]  I want to get like all these top experts on every week and like have a roundtable discussion wargaming what we should do as the Patriots with the truth, with the narrative to fight the globalists.
[00:41:38.593 --> 00:41:41.395]  We're just genuinely educating the public about what's going on.
[00:41:41.676 --> 00:41:43.958]  We have an incredible track record, our guests, our experts do.
[00:41:44.898 --> 00:41:50.043]  And our responsibility is frighteningly huge.
[00:41:52.525 --> 00:42:00.432]  And the reason I talk about this more and more, and I gave a speech to my reporters today, the TV reporters, that, hey, take yourselves really seriously.
[00:42:00.452 --> 00:42:00.952]  I know you do.
[00:42:01.172 --> 00:42:04.075]  You're in a legendary position.
[00:42:10.575 --> 00:42:18.902]  But it's a testament to what taking action can do, and that's why I want everybody out there listening and watching to know, no matter how bad all this gets in the future, we're going to make it out of it.
[00:42:19.302 --> 00:42:26.508]  Because so many seeds have been planted of truth, that tyranny will be like sunshine and water, to make a lot of seeds that haven't sprouted, will sprout.
[00:42:27.328 --> 00:42:34.875]  Seeds that were planted 30, 40 years ago by people like Leon Skousen.
[00:42:37.236 --> 00:42:38.197]  Seeds that were planted by
[00:42:39.784 --> 00:42:51.911]  Alan Greenspan, 50 years ago, 45 years ago, Alan Greenspan was basically like the Alex Jones of the 60s.
[00:42:53.832 --> 00:43:03.238]  He wrote books and had essays published against global government, against the private Federal Reserve, and a monetary plan to help America.
[00:43:03.258 --> 00:43:04.959]  They went and bought him off.
[00:43:06.696 --> 00:43:08.917]  See, when you really know history, it's so amazing.
[00:43:08.957 --> 00:43:12.637]  I mean, he was like Anakin Skywalker becoming Darth Vader.
[00:43:16.378 --> 00:43:25.040]  You know, I'll tell you who knows Greenspan and knows all these people, and you know, had dinner with Ronald Reagan, you know, years before, you know, was friends with Ronald Reagan, before Ronald Reagan got into office, when Ronald Reagan was governor.
[00:43:25.321 --> 00:43:27.121]  He's coming on next hour, Dr. Paul Greg Roberts.
[00:43:31.305 --> 00:43:34.886]  You know, we get these guys on and people don't even, in the general public, realize who they're listening to.
[00:43:34.926 --> 00:43:36.186]  It's like Cy Hirsch is coming on.
[00:43:36.566 --> 00:43:40.347]  He exposed the My Lai Massacre in Vietnam.
[00:43:40.367 --> 00:43:41.387]  I mean, he's a legend.
[00:43:41.847 --> 00:43:43.408]  And I'm not bragging about the guests we get.
[00:43:43.748 --> 00:43:47.089]  It's that we're willing to have them on and let them actually say what they want.
[00:43:48.789 --> 00:43:56.591]  And the Daily Beast's response is to make fun of everybody.
[00:43:57.955 --> 00:43:59.855]  And call me a wingnut and call drudge names.
[00:43:59.975 --> 00:44:02.076]  I mean, that's what five-year-olds do.
[00:44:02.876 --> 00:44:18.079]  They don't intellectually... I think I was about 12 years old when they had a junior high prom and I brought the beauty queen to the prom.
[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:21.660]  Everybody else was scared to ask her out.
[00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:32.956]  I was so mindless and instinctive when I was young, which is a sign of intelligence earlier on, that I was so tuned into my instincts that I always got to date the best girls because nobody else would ask them out.
[00:44:34.957 --> 00:44:37.339]  And I'm not bragging about that.
[00:44:37.379 --> 00:44:37.959]  It was a funny story.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.000]  I kind of clicked.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:45.124]  Oh, people were starting fights with me at the prom and people were saying my tuxedo looked stupid and people were saying I'm a bad dancer.
[00:44:45.144 --> 00:44:46.045]  A lot of folks were cool.
[00:44:47.759 --> 00:44:48.601]  I remember it finally clicked.
[00:44:48.781 --> 00:44:50.083]  Oh, that's why they're being mean.
[00:44:50.343 --> 00:44:53.008]  Because I've got the best looking girl.
[00:44:53.509 --> 00:44:54.791]  And I'm the best looking.
[00:44:56.912 --> 00:44:57.172]  See?
[00:44:58.313 --> 00:44:59.855]  And that's all this is.
[00:44:59.975 --> 00:45:01.676]  And I don't mean that in an arrogant way.
[00:45:01.976 --> 00:45:09.803]  These are discredited, imploding facades that a high wind comes down every week and mainstream media system collapses.
[00:45:09.823 --> 00:45:21.734]  And then, you know, Carlos Slim, one of the biggest mafia dons in the world, from Mexico, one of the richest men in the world, comes in and buys the New York Times like his toy.
[00:45:23.475 --> 00:45:24.296]  It's failed!
[00:45:26.098 --> 00:45:27.598]  CNN has failed.
[00:45:28.059 --> 00:45:29.119]  I was in there three years ago.
[00:45:29.599 --> 00:45:31.459]  I've been there many times before that.
[00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:33.080]  Five or six times.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.280]  I've been in the very studios I was in.
[00:45:36.921 --> 00:45:39.582]  Back when Larry King was there, I'd been in studios on another show.
[00:45:40.442 --> 00:45:43.022]  It was all nice, glistening, clean, energy, people everywhere.
[00:45:43.102 --> 00:45:43.543]  I was in there.
[00:45:43.603 --> 00:45:52.305]  It was a ghost town with frayed carpet and dirty toilets with feces splattered on the walls of every major bathroom like a Jackson Pollock.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.601]  And I walked out of there and I said, CNN's dead.
[00:45:56.241 --> 00:45:57.262]  It's walking dead.
[00:45:58.903 --> 00:46:00.123]  That's who these people are.
[00:46:00.163 --> 00:46:00.984]  They're frauds.
[00:46:04.405 --> 00:46:05.726]  And they need to know they're frauds.
[00:46:09.548 --> 00:46:10.988]  We know why you don't like us.
[00:46:11.609 --> 00:46:13.109]  We know why you lie about us.
[00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:14.390]  Because we're honorable.
[00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:15.491]  We care about America.
[00:46:15.751 --> 00:46:17.091]  We want people to be successful.
[00:46:17.371 --> 00:46:18.452]  We want prosperity.
[00:46:18.672 --> 00:46:19.653]  We believe in winners.
[00:46:20.593 --> 00:46:22.374]  We know we can make the world great.
[00:46:23.666 --> 00:46:24.286]  And America?
[00:46:25.226 --> 00:46:25.506]  Great.
[00:46:29.007 --> 00:46:30.688]  We don't have bad will towards people.
[00:46:32.988 --> 00:46:36.709]  We don't get mad at somebody with a faster, cooler car or a better looking girlfriend.
[00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:40.590]  We're not losers.
[00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:47.372]  We're not pack-driven scum that got where they were by social climbing inside your little clubs.
[00:46:49.492 --> 00:46:50.572]  We're renaissance men.
[00:46:50.752 --> 00:46:51.513]  We're innovators.
[00:46:51.873 --> 00:46:52.853]  We're here to kick your ass.
[00:46:54.448 --> 00:46:54.828]  You got it?
[00:46:57.351 --> 00:46:57.951]  Now here's the deal.
[00:46:57.991 --> 00:47:07.881]  You may think you got all the power and the money and the spying and everybody lined up and ready for martial law and war with the people that you can defeat what's rising against you.
[00:47:08.542 --> 00:47:08.922]  You can't.
[00:47:11.785 --> 00:47:13.006]  Not unless you blow the whole planet up.
[00:47:18.126 --> 00:47:21.468]  So you need to realize that the course you're on will fail.
[00:47:21.688 --> 00:47:23.069]  Don't be stupid like Napoleon.
[00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:24.690]  Don't be stupid like Hitler.
[00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:26.351]  They thought they knew it all, too.
[00:47:26.611 --> 00:47:28.712]  And quite frankly, they were much greater men and women than you.
[00:47:29.372 --> 00:47:32.014]  Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, they got their hands dirty.
[00:47:32.874 --> 00:47:35.255]  Both those guys were complete badasses.
[00:47:35.876 --> 00:47:37.497]  Complete studs.
[00:47:40.418 --> 00:47:43.340]  Very evil men, but hardcore.
[00:47:44.755 --> 00:47:49.477]  They had to climb to the top in collapsing civilizations and with hardcore soldiers.
[00:47:49.717 --> 00:47:50.858]  What'd you climb to the top from?
[00:47:51.098 --> 00:47:54.519]  Oh, your rich family from Harvard or Yale put you in your position?
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.221]  And now you're going to play war with Russia?
[00:47:57.441 --> 00:48:00.262]  You're going to play war, putting Al Qaeda in to kill Christians?
[00:48:00.462 --> 00:48:01.643]  You think it's cute and funny?
[00:48:01.883 --> 00:48:03.163]  Do you know what you've done?
[00:48:03.183 --> 00:48:04.424]  To quote Putin.
[00:48:06.024 --> 00:48:13.688]  Putin came out last week, and then their foreign minister said, Lavrov came out and said, Who is running America?
[00:48:16.018 --> 00:48:16.959]  Who is in charge?
[00:48:17.199 --> 00:48:22.642]  Because the Army is trying to fight Al-Qaeda, ISIS, and you're over here at the State Department.
[00:48:22.822 --> 00:48:24.463]  See, they're just putting it all out, folks.
[00:48:26.704 --> 00:48:29.666]  Do you realize how mega-massive things are right now?
[00:48:29.686 --> 00:48:32.488]  Do you realize the very battle for this country is happening right now?
[00:48:32.748 --> 00:48:37.931]  And you're at the New York Times and the Daily Beast making jokes, calling us tinfoil hats.
[00:48:39.652 --> 00:48:41.333]  Why don't you call Cy Hirsch a tinfoil hat?
[00:48:47.318 --> 00:48:50.261]  Now before I go any further, I'm just gonna do some mid-air refueling here.

[00:49:26.301 --> 00:49:27.582]  I want to expand in the face of this.

[00:53:40.811 --> 00:53:42.972]  They want you to believe that your life's gonna be uneventful.
[00:53:44.293 --> 00:53:48.496]  They want you to believe that you don't really matter or count, you should just sit over there on the sidelines.
[00:53:49.316 --> 00:53:51.557]  But nothing really important's going on, just move along.
[00:53:52.658 --> 00:53:58.121]  While the future of our species, to a great extent, is being decided right now.
[00:53:59.562 --> 00:54:03.344]  Welcome to a scientific, world government corporate takeover.
[00:54:05.746 --> 00:54:06.586]  Welcome to your life.
[00:54:08.247 --> 00:54:09.128]  There's no turning back.
[00:54:10.273 --> 00:54:11.774]  And you can't be in denial about that.
[00:54:13.174 --> 00:54:17.757]  The minute you're aware of the globalist program and how it operates, though, it becomes a game to fight it.
[00:54:18.597 --> 00:54:22.859]  You see, you're designed to adapt and overcome.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:29.763]  The problem is we tend to adapt to incremental tyranny by actually submitting to it and learning to live with it.
[00:54:30.783 --> 00:54:33.765]  And that would work if it was environmental
[00:54:34.847 --> 00:54:37.029]  And we didn't have a way to change our environment.
[00:54:37.049 --> 00:54:38.890]  But humans are all about changing our environments.
[00:54:39.531 --> 00:54:40.692]  Overcoming our environment.
[00:54:41.933 --> 00:54:48.098]  But the new environments we've built have helped us in many ways, but have now been hijacked to be prisons.
[00:54:48.678 --> 00:54:49.939]  This is fundamental to what I'm saying.
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:55:04.151]  I was thinking about watching my daughters drive off to camp, art camp, this morning, how it is the number one most dangerous thing in their life.
[00:55:05.444 --> 00:55:09.445]  As I watched the SUV drive away.
[00:55:10.786 --> 00:55:15.127]  And I thought about them becoming 16 in cars and had a lot of anxiety about it because that's a real danger.
[00:55:17.848 --> 00:55:21.369]  And I realized how we've just adapted to cars killing millions of people every year.
[00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:32.493]  And how that's an example of how we just accept that our kids may go down to gather water at the water hole and a saber-toothed tiger might jump out and eat them.
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:34.741]  We hope it doesn't happen.
[00:55:34.801 --> 00:55:36.382]  We can't always go to the waterhole with them.
[00:55:36.502 --> 00:55:37.423]  I gotta go out and hunt.
[00:55:38.544 --> 00:55:43.949]  And I gotta let my daughters go down to the waterhole and maybe get eaten.
[00:55:47.332 --> 00:55:48.473]  And I just handle that.
[00:55:48.553 --> 00:55:50.154]  I compartmentalize that as a man.
[00:55:51.055 --> 00:55:52.236]  Because it's part of the environment.
[00:55:55.979 --> 00:55:59.162]  Now sure, I try to make sure when they go to the waterhole that they always go with somebody.
[00:55:59.943 --> 00:56:00.343]  An adult.
[00:56:00.823 --> 00:56:01.384]  A younger male.
[00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:06.229]  The younger male tells them don't wander off too far.
[00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:09.450]  But they don't always listen.
[00:56:12.071 --> 00:56:14.251]  Until they see someone get eaten by a big cat.
[00:56:15.312 --> 00:56:16.592]  Let's go back to our race memories here.
[00:56:17.232 --> 00:56:17.652]  Human race.
[00:56:18.692 --> 00:56:19.213]  The one race.
[00:56:20.393 --> 00:56:21.153]  The one that triumphed.
[00:56:21.173 --> 00:56:22.373]  The one that went through all this together.
[00:56:23.774 --> 00:56:25.694]  Now the system has us at odds with each other.
[00:56:26.954 --> 00:56:28.955]  A predatory group above us, playing God.
[00:56:31.872 --> 00:56:34.573]  So we have to not adapt to their tyranny by putting up with it.
[00:56:34.593 --> 00:56:45.096]  We have to adapt by exposing it and empowering ourselves to engage in financial and informational and spiritual and cultural war.
[00:56:46.116 --> 00:56:52.078]  And like lifting weights or climbing a mountain, we will become stronger in the animating contest.
[00:56:53.178 --> 00:56:55.679]  The enlightenment, the empowerment,
[00:56:59.614 --> 00:57:03.837]  Is not adapting to their nanny state that dehumanizes us, but facing the dangers.
[00:57:04.678 --> 00:57:09.522]  Because they're gonna come in and say, self-driving cars will keep the wrecks down, don't you not want your daughters to die?
[00:57:09.742 --> 00:57:19.890]  But in truth, it's not just some faceless computer that isn't trying to enslave us, it's being programmed as the artificial system to deliver my daughters into an even more dangerous world.
[00:57:21.612 --> 00:57:23.213]  And so because of that, I oppose it.
[00:57:25.811 --> 00:57:30.456]  Even if we had a good government building a panopticon computer system to quote, keep us all safe.
[00:57:31.872 --> 00:57:43.700]  What would happen when those controllers died, or a new generation got control, or an AI system that was evil, or an alien intelligence from a deep space nebula came and uses this system to hijack things?
[00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:49.184]  You don't want centralized, one-point-of-failure systems, and that's what the globalists are setting up.
[00:57:49.985 --> 00:58:00.152]  I could write a science fiction book as an allegory, where aliens come, deceive them, they're giving them all this power, deceive an elite, they're giving them control, and really they're just building a system to enslave everyone.
[00:58:00.851 --> 00:58:02.532]  But that's historically what will happen.
[00:58:03.153 --> 00:58:06.875]  They're building something that will destroy the elite themselves.
[00:58:08.857 --> 00:58:11.139]  We have to have a real debate about this with the people.
[00:58:11.519 --> 00:58:17.223]  And we're here to force that debate about what's currently being decided, the future destiny of the species.
[00:58:17.583 --> 00:58:18.084]  Stay with us.
[00:58:18.344 --> 00:58:18.864]  Spread the word.

[00:59:29.344 --> 00:59:31.934]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:50.649 --> 00:59:51.349]  Big Brother.
[00:59:51.790 --> 00:59:53.011]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:53.571 --> 00:59:54.572]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:55.492 --> 00:59:56.893]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:59:57.173 --> 00:59:58.414]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:58.814 --> 01:00:03.357]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:09.381 --> 01:00:12.663]  I love this song.
[01:00:12.763 --> 01:00:14.865]  Girl like you.
[01:00:14.905 --> 01:00:15.945]  What you talking about?
[01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:16.426]  Skin deep?
[01:00:19.145 --> 01:00:20.746]  That is an avant-garde film.
[01:00:20.906 --> 01:00:22.287]  That deserves five Oscars.
[01:00:23.929 --> 01:00:29.253]  90 plus percent of the people in that movie, Scarlett Johansson, don't know they're in a movie.
[01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:35.177]  Industrial wastelands of Scotland, Scarlett Johansson pulls up to pick you up.
[01:00:35.657 --> 01:00:36.558]  Oh, the men get in.
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:45.385]  They take them to an abandoned house to simulate aliens abducting them and rendering them down.
[01:00:46.997 --> 01:00:47.337]  Wow!
[01:00:47.997 --> 01:00:53.519]  They didn't tell the guys till like you get in the house, there's a big black pool, she's naked, you're supposed to walk out there with her.
[01:00:54.159 --> 01:00:54.499]  Whoa!
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:57.761]  That's hardcore!
[01:00:58.761 --> 01:01:09.444]  I was just thinking this song, when I was a kid I never knew what the song was about and then you listen to it later and of course that's it's it's it's about alien abduction.
[01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:11.145]  Pretty interesting stuff.
[01:01:17.745 --> 01:01:19.286]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is coming on.
[01:01:19.346 --> 01:01:27.692]  Every time I say his name on air, I remember Colonel Craig Roberts, who just wants to fade off into the distance.
[01:01:29.634 --> 01:01:32.255]  Basically, his family was high-level CIA.
[01:01:35.698 --> 01:01:38.660]  And then he chose to just go be in the Marines in Vietnam.
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:40.201]  Wrote one shot, one kill.
[01:01:40.261 --> 01:01:41.042]  He was a famous sniper.
[01:01:42.039 --> 01:01:45.502]  And then he came back and was just a police officer, SWAT team commander, helicopter pilot.
[01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:47.383]  He had just an amazing life.
[01:01:47.623 --> 01:01:49.124]  And then he had a near-death experience.
[01:01:49.385 --> 01:01:50.986]  He died for, I think, 10 minutes.
[01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:51.926]  Completely dead.
[01:01:51.947 --> 01:01:52.807]  They'd walked off and left.
[01:01:54.248 --> 01:01:58.812]  And I spent some time with him in Oklahoma, where he lives, and at events around the country.
[01:01:58.832 --> 01:02:00.053]  He's just a really classy guy.
[01:02:03.755 --> 01:02:05.977]  But there's this thing that happens with these older guys.
[01:02:06.778 --> 01:02:08.999]  They just fade out.
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:11.021]  They just don't want to fight anymore.
[01:02:14.008 --> 01:02:15.308]  They just want to be left alone.
[01:02:18.749 --> 01:02:20.089]  We need to get him back on the show.
[01:02:20.109 --> 01:02:21.149]  He's a really interesting guy.
[01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:26.950]  One time the helicopter engine went out and he did that auto-rotate deal from like thousands of feet up.
[01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:33.692]  He said he got out of the helicopter and him and the co-pilot were like two inches shorter because it compacted his whole spine.
[01:02:34.732 --> 01:02:35.172]  I don't know.
[01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:36.392]  I just kind of wander around.
[01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:38.052]  I mean, it's not that I don't have enough news to cover.
[01:02:38.132 --> 01:02:40.613]  It's just, it's so hardcore what's going on.
[01:02:43.444 --> 01:02:47.945]  And Nico, I want Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on, but I want Colonel Craig Roberts on.
[01:02:48.405 --> 01:02:57.887]  I remember one time I told the producers, like a decade ago, I said, get me Craig Roberts on.
[01:02:59.887 --> 01:03:02.507]  And then I went, I said, Colonel Roberts!
[01:03:02.567 --> 01:03:07.108]  We went to him, and it was the other Roberts, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:03:07.148 --> 01:03:09.089]  But that's just an interesting little factoid.
[01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:10.909]  I said, well, we'll just do the interview with you.
[01:03:12.486 --> 01:03:13.366]  Uh, but vice versa.
[01:03:14.247 --> 01:03:15.587]  That's how names tend to work.
[01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:24.450]  Also worked out really hard this morning.
[01:03:25.651 --> 01:03:27.291]  Kinda got in that rare crazed mode.
[01:03:30.333 --> 01:03:37.335]  And I don't mean to make this a plug, but... Super Mel Vitality X2... I take a little more than I used to.
[01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:38.336]  And, uh...
[01:03:39.895 --> 01:03:41.897]  I think I may have to cut back a little bit on the super male.
[01:03:41.957 --> 01:03:44.139]  I mean, I'm not doing a plug now, but I guess I am.
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.822]  It definitely works with my physiology.
[01:03:47.942 --> 01:03:55.709]  And everyone I know, everyone, but one caller and Jakari Jackson say it was just phenomenal.
[01:03:56.609 --> 01:04:01.233]  And I'm being honest, Jakari took it for a week, but if you see Jakari, he looks like he has 3% body fat and lifts weights constantly.
[01:04:01.273 --> 01:04:04.756]  I mean, he looks like a muscular Calvin Klein model.
[01:04:04.796 --> 01:04:06.318]  So I guess if you're in that good of shape,
[01:04:08.342 --> 01:04:09.383]  Leanne's like, are you kidding?
[01:04:09.403 --> 01:04:10.404]  That stuff's incredible.
[01:04:11.705 --> 01:04:14.768]  And I know two people that say it didn't knock their socks off.
[01:04:14.808 --> 01:04:17.850]  I mean, it's got hardcore known herbs in it.
[01:04:18.611 --> 01:04:21.553]  That libido, energy, stamina, you name it.
[01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:25.036]  And just try it out for yourself and your support in the broadcast.

[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.562]  Well, check out these headlines.
[01:04:40.882 --> 01:04:43.344]  60,000 New Yorkers sign up for tiny house development.
[01:04:43.444 --> 01:04:45.385]  265 square foot apartments.
[01:04:45.726 --> 01:04:47.907]  But would you pay $3,000 a month for this?
[01:04:48.408 --> 01:04:52.831]  Next, inside NYC's impossibly small 100 square foot apartment.
[01:04:53.031 --> 01:04:54.712]  It only goes for $2,800 a month.
[01:04:54.993 --> 01:04:57.374]  Or how about life in a 90 square foot box?
[01:04:57.535 --> 01:05:02.438]  Woman's apartment takes cramped New York living to the extreme, but she's living in the West Village for just $7.75 a month.
[01:05:03.579 --> 01:05:04.720]  And here's one out of New York.
[01:05:33.539 --> 01:05:36.580]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:37.620]  I want more candy!
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.740]  I want more video games!
[01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:39.140]  Mine, mine, mine!
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:49.682]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:05:50.022 --> 01:05:52.563]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:05:52.723 --> 01:05:56.083]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:05:56.283 --> 01:05:59.024]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system.
[01:05:59.184 --> 01:05:59.444]  I don't know.
[01:06:19.957 --> 01:06:21.599]  There's a powerful calming formula out there.
[01:06:21.859 --> 01:06:29.148]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:06:36.957 --> 01:06:43.760]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.561]  We've always offered five months free.
[01:06:46.741 --> 01:06:52.303]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of signups.
[01:06:52.643 --> 01:06:55.785]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[01:06:55.805 --> 01:06:59.026]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.

[01:07:48.613 --> 01:07:49.253]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:07:49.293 --> 01:07:54.575]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:54.635 --> 01:08:01.637]  There I was, completely wasted, out of work and down.
[01:08:01.797 --> 01:08:07.238]  All excited, so frustrated, as I dreamed of town and town.
[01:08:07.298 --> 01:08:13.780]  Still so nobody cares, if I live or die.
[01:08:14.835 --> 01:08:16.417]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:17.718 --> 01:08:21.401]  We are now into our number two broadcasting worldwide.
[01:08:23.123 --> 01:08:38.318]  Coming up, Cy Hirsch, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, will join us to break down Military to Military, his new book, which confirms what Colonel Schaefer and many other sources, Tosh Plumley and other whistleblowers, have said here on this broadcast, bravely.
[01:08:40.097 --> 01:08:44.578]  That Benghazi was a staged event to ship arms to Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra, now known as ISIS?
[01:08:46.639 --> 01:08:47.739]  Unbelievable information.
[01:08:48.299 --> 01:09:04.063]  And that the State Department's been running a covert war, using mercenaries and others, and that they've had major, what I would call, not mutiny, but people fighting the takeover, what Steve Pchenik yesterday called a soft coup.
[01:09:05.024 --> 01:09:05.944]  And now you have
[01:09:07.964 --> 01:09:18.192]  The General, the former head of Defense Intelligence, going public a couple months ago, coming out and saying we were ordered to fund ISIS and Al Qaeda deliberately by the neocons and Obama, basically.
[01:09:18.693 --> 01:09:20.274]  This is unprecedented.
[01:09:20.294 --> 01:09:22.016]  I want to get into this with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:09:22.356 --> 01:09:32.644]  I want to get into this on a big article that he wrote in a syndicated column that we covered at Infowars.com last week to talk about the state of what's happening.
[01:09:32.885 --> 01:09:36.548]  But I can tell you, obviously, talking to folks in the Trump camp, I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:09:37.364 --> 01:09:37.665]  I don't know.
[01:09:51.357 --> 01:09:52.238]  I don't think so.
[01:10:12.561 --> 01:10:16.103]  He's been a big insider, and he's been somewhat pessimistic, and I understand why.
[01:10:16.723 --> 01:10:27.309]  But I tell you, there are some very exciting things happening right now, in government, in the military, you name it, that shows me that there are people making very moral stands.
[01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:28.750]  Now, do we have an Operation Valkyrie?
[01:10:29.331 --> 01:10:31.112]  No, because there's not one Hitler to take out.
[01:10:31.172 --> 01:10:33.233]  I don't want any violence, and Obama's a puppet.
[01:10:34.022 --> 01:10:46.572]  But there is a soft coup against a bunch of different agendas, where we now learn our military was working with the Russians and the Syrians years ago to counter the insurgents, the bad insurgents, which are 90 plus percent.
[01:10:46.852 --> 01:10:50.054]  So that's a briefing at the start of the hour for new listeners that just tuned in.
[01:10:50.895 --> 01:10:55.439]  And I want to get into that, the Russia situation, and what Dr. Roberts thinks about Trump.
[01:10:55.779 --> 01:10:57.740]  Donald Trump, an evaluation.
[01:10:58.341 --> 01:11:00.522]  And he goes over it, and I think it's a
[01:11:01.283 --> 01:11:02.443]  Glad to be with you.
[01:11:02.523 --> 01:11:03.424]  Oh, whatever suits you.
[01:11:03.464 --> 01:11:04.444]  Trump, perhaps, huh?
[01:11:24.517 --> 01:11:33.259]  Well, it's clear that he has the personality of a leader, and I think he's liked because he doesn't back down.
[01:11:33.279 --> 01:11:38.261]  He's not always apologizing every time he says something that people get upset about.
[01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:46.283]  But I think he has a lot of problems in that he doesn't really, I think, know what to do.
[01:11:48.013 --> 01:11:54.920]  And he seems to think that as long as he's making aggressive statements, the people will follow him.
[01:11:56.081 --> 01:12:03.969]  And that's probably the case because they're tired of all these people who are always mealy-mouthed, and Trump's not mealy-mouthed.
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:11.604]  But he doesn't come out of the policy community.
[01:12:11.624 --> 01:12:17.808]  He doesn't know the policy people who could help him change the policies.
[01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:27.095]  And it's unlikely he would be staffed up with a government that could help him.
[01:12:27.935 --> 01:12:29.196]  That's a difficult thing to do.
[01:12:29.296 --> 01:12:32.358]  I mean, it was hard even for Ronald Reagan to get some of us in there.
[01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:39.279]  And Reagan was a longtime political figure.
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.324]  He had something of a movement.
[01:12:42.748 --> 01:12:51.673]  So my point is that without a movement behind him, without policy knowledge, he's not really well informed.
[01:12:53.354 --> 01:12:57.337]  He may not be able to do much even if he gets an office.
[01:12:57.397 --> 01:13:06.322]  Would you be willing to talk to him and with some others and advise him on a policy group for his campaign to come in and help him?
[01:13:06.342 --> 01:13:08.764]  Because I agree he's very smart but has his perspective
[01:13:09.304 --> 01:13:11.686]  And so he does really good in some areas, not so good in others.
[01:13:12.067 --> 01:13:21.315]  I mean, obviously, if he picked people from this political spectrum, then that would probably, obviously, not scare the establishment as much either.
[01:13:22.797 --> 01:13:27.842]  Of course, I'd be willing to talk to him, but they would just tell him I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[01:13:29.492 --> 01:13:30.294]  He won't listen to that.
[01:13:30.494 --> 01:13:32.037]  I'm going to get in touch with him.
[01:13:32.238 --> 01:13:34.983]  I'm suspicious of 9-11, sir.
[01:13:35.003 --> 01:13:40.313]  But another problem he faces, these apportees have to be cleared by the Senate.
[01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:41.796]  They have to be confirmed in office.
[01:13:43.248 --> 01:13:47.530]  And all the interest groups have their claws into the senators.
[01:13:47.670 --> 01:14:11.100]  And so, if he tried to put in people who were in any sense controversial, in the sense of disagreeing with the neoconservatives, or disagreeing that the invasion of Iraq was a good thing, or the overthrow of Qaddafi was a good thing, the senators would simply not confirm them.
[01:14:12.287 --> 01:14:34.000]  So it's very difficult, given the way the American system works, to get change out of it without a lot more awareness than exists, both among people and among politicians, and without the politicians seeing that there's now more at stake than their campaign contributions.
[01:14:34.907 --> 01:14:39.511]  And that they actually now have to take risks to save the country.
[01:14:39.531 --> 01:14:45.816]  It takes that type of environment for a leader to be successful.
[01:14:46.577 --> 01:14:48.759]  And without that environment, it's difficult.
[01:14:49.179 --> 01:14:52.943]  But don't we have the climate forming the atmosphere now for that to happen?
[01:14:54.404 --> 01:14:55.825]  I don't think so.
[01:14:57.446 --> 01:14:59.828]  But I'm willing for there to be.
[01:14:59.889 --> 01:15:01.330]  I mean, I don't want to
[01:15:03.553 --> 01:15:06.215]  I'm not opposed to having that in climate.
[01:15:06.395 --> 01:15:08.296]  In fact, that's why I do what I do.
[01:15:08.376 --> 01:15:14.461]  I'm trying to make people aware so that we would have a climate for later.
[01:15:14.881 --> 01:15:22.466]  Obviously, there's not a climate in the general public, but there is a climate in the insiders and in the actual police and military.
[01:15:22.526 --> 01:15:23.967]  Believe me, I have the contacts.
[01:15:24.327 --> 01:15:25.148]  It's explosive.
[01:15:25.168 --> 01:15:26.349]  I know you have a lot of contacts, sir.
[01:15:26.949 --> 01:15:32.834]  But I know you're mainly with the big policy wonk level and the big think tanks, and they may still, you know, not know what's going on.
[01:15:32.874 --> 01:15:33.415]  I think they do.
[01:15:33.435 --> 01:15:34.476]  They're pretty smart like you.
[01:15:34.836 --> 01:15:39.820]  I'm here to tell you, the people that actually do the hanging in this country are really awake right now.
[01:15:41.181 --> 01:15:42.903]  Well, that's good news.
[01:15:43.023 --> 01:15:49.469]  I was impressed when I saw the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency tell the truth about ISIS.
[01:15:50.669 --> 01:15:51.549]  And our involvement.
[01:15:52.650 --> 01:16:00.873]  And I've seen nice, I've seen sensible patriotic things said by other military leaders.
[01:16:01.873 --> 01:16:02.893]  Which is revolutionary.
[01:16:03.894 --> 01:16:11.936]  And I even think Kissinger's statements that we can't solve any problem unless we're in it together with the Russians.
[01:16:12.056 --> 01:16:18.879]  We can't simultaneously solve problems and create conflict with Russia.
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:20.960]  Exactly.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:27.947]  Kissinger's now writing huge articles, papers, basically sounding like you, hedging his bets when we all know he's been involved in all this.
[01:16:28.267 --> 01:16:29.448]  So this is a big deal, sir.
[01:16:29.808 --> 01:16:36.895]  I mean, I understand that you like to be pessimistic so you don't overshoot how good we're doing, but I'm telling you, there's some real light here coming in.
[01:16:38.274 --> 01:16:40.196]  Well, we're going to need these people.
[01:16:42.539 --> 01:16:51.950]  They'll have to take more and more risks and show more and more of themselves just in order to block the growing likelihood of conflict with Russia.
[01:16:52.936 --> 01:16:55.237]  Or with Russia and China.
[01:16:56.117 --> 01:16:59.398]  This is still the neoconservative policy.
[01:16:59.818 --> 01:17:00.058]  Sure.
[01:17:00.418 --> 01:17:05.740]  Well, the neocons can kick around Iraq or kick around a few countries they've been, you know, had sanctions on for 20 years.
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:08.181]  But yeah, they're not going to be able to take on Russia or China.
[01:17:08.481 --> 01:17:16.103]  And I look at Richard Perle and Walt Wolfowitz and all these guys, they are literally the school wimp who's become a bully.
[01:17:16.163 --> 01:17:18.904]  I mean, that's what's scary to me is these are not military people.
[01:17:20.751 --> 01:17:28.817]  Well, no they're not, but they've been in the Pentagon, and they've been in the policy positions that control military policy.
[01:17:28.937 --> 01:17:34.721]  So, I wouldn't say they're powerless or without influence.
[01:17:34.761 --> 01:17:36.843]  In fact, we still live in a neocon world.
[01:17:37.763 --> 01:17:40.265]  And the media, they still have the media, don't they?
[01:17:40.285 --> 01:17:43.768]  I mean, they've got the Wall Street Journal, the Weekly Standard, Fox News.
[01:17:43.788 --> 01:17:44.889]  I mean, they've got the whole thing.
[01:17:44.909 --> 01:17:47.270]  The New York Times, the Washington Post.
[01:17:48.638 --> 01:17:57.367]  So much of Washington responds to the print of TV media, not to you and I. I agree with you, but we've come from behind.
[01:17:57.428 --> 01:17:59.870]  We're gaining ground in this 12 round fight.
[01:18:01.212 --> 01:18:03.194]  What do you make of the calls
[01:18:05.683 --> 01:18:07.104]  Well, it's like you say.
[01:18:07.124 --> 01:18:08.965]  It's very rich.
[01:18:08.985 --> 01:18:12.508]  It's not clear to what extent we're actually fighting ISIS.
[01:18:12.548 --> 01:18:12.948]  It's our creation.
[01:18:34.253 --> 01:18:45.605]  Uh, and we hope to use it to, and I say we, I mean the neocons, and most hope to use ISIS to overthrow Assad, just like they used it to overthrow Gaddafi.
[01:18:47.173 --> 01:19:03.819]  You know, when the Russians and the British Parliament blocked Obama's planned invasion of Syria, that's when the neocons turned to ISIS and sent them in there to do the job, pretending they were Syrian rebels fighting against the dictator.
[01:19:05.959 --> 01:19:14.202]  So, it's not clear, you're probably better informed on this than I am, how much Washington is really fighting ISIS.
[01:19:15.316 --> 01:19:18.919]  You know, when the Russians went in there, we were very protective of ISIS.
[01:19:19.299 --> 01:19:21.320]  Didn't want the Russians attacking ISIS.
[01:19:22.221 --> 01:19:23.442]  Well, that's the policy, people.
[01:19:23.522 --> 01:19:29.126]  I can tell you directly from high-level Pentagon and many people that have been on the show, that this is what's happened.
[01:19:31.127 --> 01:19:32.728]  And Cy Hirsch is coming on to break it down.
[01:19:36.474 --> 01:19:49.485]  Every time they have the military, whether it was Libya or whether it was Egypt or whether it was the situation in Syria, right down to the non-commissioned officers, right up to pretty much the top.
[01:19:49.726 --> 01:19:54.210]  That's why Obama had that big purge the last few years and put a bunch of just desk jockeys in.
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:03.585]  They got fed up with Benghazi watching for six, seven hours on the predator footage of everybody being killed and the order to stand down from Hillary and then seeing her lie.
[01:20:03.905 --> 01:20:06.207]  Thousands actually witnessed that, basically.
[01:20:06.767 --> 01:20:13.331]  It turned into such a fiasco that caused a huge sea change to actually watch it for themselves, despite all the corruption made them click.
[01:20:13.912 --> 01:20:21.016]  And then all these whistleblowers started exposing the plan to turn loose these al-Qaeda proxy armies all over in a deal with Saudi Arabia to destabilize things.
[01:20:21.977 --> 01:20:32.165]  And so the military began blowing the whistle, and so even generals started quietly, through Egypt and others, feeding the Russians and Assad intel.
[01:20:33.497 --> 01:20:42.525]  And then you've got the State Department over there trying to cover everything up with the Pentagon leaking, or large factions of it, leaking that Hillary was in an arms deal.
[01:20:44.106 --> 01:20:46.148]  And that's basically what's going on.
[01:20:46.168 --> 01:20:54.716]  I mean, Colonel Schaefer told me a couple years ago that, you know, he was in hearings with Congress, and he said, I'm not going to tell you what I told them, but now I'm going to say this here.
[01:20:55.296 --> 01:20:55.616]  I don't know.
[01:21:17.168 --> 01:21:18.469]  Well, I'm not entirely surprised at that.
[01:21:18.489 --> 01:21:20.450]  I do know that the military officers
[01:21:43.257 --> 01:21:44.461]  We're good to go.
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:57.844]  They've had a very poor opinion of the neoconservatives and their various schemes.
[01:21:59.105 --> 01:22:07.831]  But of course their promotions and appointments were controlled by neoconservatives and so they really couldn't do much about it.
[01:22:08.151 --> 01:22:19.579]  But I'm glad to see that an increasing number of them have had enough and are prepared to put their foot down and to speak the warnings that people need to hear.
[01:22:20.099 --> 01:22:22.381]  So that's, I agree with you, that's encouraging news.
[01:22:22.841 --> 01:22:28.744]  It's also encouraging that the neocons have not been able to completely corrupt the officer corps.
[01:22:29.845 --> 01:22:36.089]  I'm sure they've tried by promotions and other such methods.
[01:22:36.109 --> 01:22:48.356]  And the fact that we still have, from what you're telling me, I conclude, we still have an officer corps with some integrity and some ability to think about the country and to see themselves
[01:22:49.917 --> 01:22:54.001]  Not as the end-all be-all, but to see the country.
[01:22:54.682 --> 01:22:58.666]  And so that's a good development.
[01:22:58.806 --> 01:23:03.831]  It means that we are in a stronger position than we were.
[01:23:04.292 --> 01:23:06.234]  And it means the neocons are in a weaker one.
[01:23:06.994 --> 01:23:07.755]  But they're still there.
[01:23:08.736 --> 01:23:11.037]  And they could pull any type of trick.
[01:23:11.117 --> 01:23:19.142]  With your knowledge of the neocons, sir, being around them for 30 years or longer in Washington, what type of bag of tricks do you think they've got?
[01:23:19.202 --> 01:23:21.223]  What might they do?
[01:23:21.843 --> 01:23:32.809]  Okay, I think that they're well connected to whatever the black ops forces are that are not really controlled or well known.
[01:23:33.769 --> 01:23:34.550]  They're off budget.
[01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:37.350]  They're off the books.
[01:23:37.511 --> 01:23:45.217]  And I think the New York Times are well-connected to these black-op groups, and they can act independently of the official government.
[01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:50.621]  They can pull off black flag events, or false flag events.
[01:23:52.649 --> 01:23:54.270]  So, what would they do?
[01:23:54.710 --> 01:24:02.435]  You know, if the neocons feel they're losing power, losing their grip, losing control, they may get increasingly reckless.
[01:24:03.315 --> 01:24:06.938]  So, I can't really say.
[01:24:08.038 --> 01:24:17.144]  On the other hand, it's possible that some of the neoconservants themselves are losing their confidence in their agenda of world hegemony.
[01:24:18.465 --> 01:24:25.515]  I think many of them did think that the situation in Iraq would be over with very quickly.
[01:24:28.581 --> 01:24:36.446]  We would be seen as a great liberator, and people would be friendly, and we would have another vassal state.
[01:24:37.146 --> 01:24:38.727]  I think many of them didn't believe that.
[01:24:40.128 --> 01:24:50.194]  So there's a lot in the events to disillusion those among the neoconservatives who have the ability of any introspection.
[01:24:50.874 --> 01:24:54.016]  Well, yeah, they claim they want to fight Iran, but everything they do helps Iran.
[01:24:55.156 --> 01:24:57.658]  And they claim they want to break Iraq in three parts, but then claim they don't.
[01:24:57.898 --> 01:24:58.898]  Let's shift gears into Putin.
[01:24:58.938 --> 01:25:05.061]  As you know, he came out in the last few weeks, so did Lavrov, the foreign minister, and said, who's in control of your Syria operations?
[01:25:05.081 --> 01:25:12.265]  Because your military is giving us info and helping us, but then your State Department and others are directing things that are helping them.
[01:25:12.805 --> 01:25:13.726]  Who is in control?
[01:25:13.806 --> 01:25:17.468]  I mean, pretty much Putin is signaling he knows there's an internal fight going on.
[01:25:19.804 --> 01:25:22.407]  Well, he's right, I suspect.
[01:25:23.528 --> 01:25:26.291]  It may be that there are different people in control.
[01:25:28.213 --> 01:25:38.144]  Look, I can remember, Alex, when I was in the Treasury, I would go over to White House meetings with the President about his economic policy.
[01:25:39.045 --> 01:25:40.627]  And the President would make a decision.
[01:25:41.835 --> 01:25:45.459]  And everybody left with a different understanding of what the decision was.
[01:25:46.961 --> 01:25:51.606]  Because they were all shaping the decision to support their own agenda.
[01:25:53.328 --> 01:25:56.452]  Sure, it's like an interpreter when you're doing a TV show saying something you didn't say.
[01:25:57.438 --> 01:25:57.899]  That's right.
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:06.190]  And so there are so many agendas, and there are so many alliances.
[01:26:06.911 --> 01:26:13.821]  A lot of the alliances are unlikely, but for the moment, the two agendas fit, and so they support one another.
[01:26:14.682 --> 01:26:16.844]  I, you know, these things are not predictable.
[01:26:16.924 --> 01:26:24.190]  I think what we have to be worried about is the language of hostility that has developed in official Washington.
[01:26:24.311 --> 01:26:25.211]  Oh, the debates.
[01:26:25.271 --> 01:26:25.772]  The debates.
[01:26:25.832 --> 01:26:29.175]  The Russians said it's like human sacrifice of Russia, ritual sacrifice.
[01:26:29.435 --> 01:26:30.216]  Bloody their nose.
[01:26:30.276 --> 01:26:31.637]  Blow up their airplanes.
[01:26:31.697 --> 01:26:32.498]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:26:33.118 --> 01:26:33.678]  Yeah, I know.
[01:26:33.839 --> 01:26:50.190]  And so what I'm saying is we have to worry about this language of violence and hostility that comes out of the media, the presidential candidates, because this shows that there's no trust between nuclear powers.
[01:26:51.471 --> 01:26:59.876]  And if there's no trust between nuclear powers, that's when you really get the likelihood of a nuclear war.
[01:27:00.097 --> 01:27:01.878]  You know, all during my lifetime,
[01:27:03.239 --> 01:27:15.225]  From John Kennedy through Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush, the office's president was always trying to build trust between Washington and Moscow.
[01:27:16.025 --> 01:27:22.128]  They wanted trust between the two nuclear powers so that nobody would jump to the wrong conclusion and push back.
[01:27:23.168 --> 01:27:27.910]  Well, what we've seen in the new conservative era is a complete destruction of this trust.
[01:27:28.751 --> 01:27:31.172]  And again, we have massive distrust.
[01:27:32.325 --> 01:27:33.146]  I don't think so.
[01:27:47.759 --> 01:27:49.480]  We're back into a worse world.
[01:27:49.881 --> 01:27:52.923]  And we've given Russia the initiative to actually build up, expand.
[01:27:53.003 --> 01:27:54.504]  It actually is against American interest.
[01:27:54.925 --> 01:28:06.554]  We've actually made Putin a superstar, all because the neocons don't want anyone talking to the policy heads because they're so jealous and greedy, like it's a college frat and a popularity contest.
[01:28:06.654 --> 01:28:09.936]  Oh, don't talk to them, they're bad people, and then it endangers the whole world.
[01:28:10.217 --> 01:28:13.980]  It sounds like horrible, amateur foreign policy, sir.
[01:28:14.991 --> 01:28:18.014]  Yeah, but they're in charge and this is the danger that they've created.
[01:28:18.074 --> 01:28:29.247]  So, I'm saying as hopeful as we can see some of the developments that you've talked about, we have to keep in mind we still have this very dangerous situation where the neoconservatives have broken down trust.
[01:28:29.547 --> 01:28:30.428]  I agree.
[01:28:32.109 --> 01:28:35.850]  And when you have that type of a situation, it's dangerous.
[01:28:36.090 --> 01:28:41.932]  I think we're in more danger now than we were at any time during the Cold War because there's less trust.
[01:28:41.992 --> 01:28:44.213]  I mean, how can Putin trust Washington?
[01:28:44.253 --> 01:28:45.653]  We broke every agreement.
[01:28:46.193 --> 01:28:47.013]  They're mad dog.
[01:28:47.053 --> 01:28:47.674]  They're mad dog.
[01:28:47.694 --> 01:28:48.914]  We demonized him.
[01:28:48.954 --> 01:28:50.414]  We issued threats.
[01:28:52.095 --> 01:28:53.615]  You know, they can't trust us.
[01:28:54.336 --> 01:28:59.097]  And so it won't take too much for them to say, well, it's them or us.
[01:28:59.977 --> 01:29:00.958]  We're acting villainous.
[01:29:01.058 --> 01:29:02.899]  PaulCraigRoberts.org.
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:04.140]  Amazing info.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:04.981]  Find his books there.
[01:29:05.041 --> 01:29:06.102]  Have a great New Year, sir.
[01:29:06.422 --> 01:29:07.383]  And thank you for your time.
[01:29:08.904 --> 01:29:10.545]  Always a pleasure to talk to you, Alex.
[01:29:11.666 --> 01:29:12.487]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:29:12.547 --> 01:29:12.847]  Thank you.
[01:29:12.867 --> 01:29:13.468]  Have a great New Year.
[01:29:13.488 --> 01:29:14.248]  Say hi to your family for me.
[01:29:14.268 --> 01:29:15.149]  We're going to be back.
[01:29:15.169 --> 01:29:15.970]  I'm in the news blitz.
[01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:17.111]  The attack on the Second Amendment.
[01:29:17.411 --> 01:29:18.011]  The economy.
[01:29:18.192 --> 01:29:18.572]  All of it.
[01:29:18.672 --> 01:29:19.453]  It's coming up.
[01:29:19.713 --> 01:29:20.894]  This is the info war.
[01:29:21.254 --> 01:29:22.935]  All we want is a future for our children.
[01:29:22.955 --> 01:29:24.517]  We're all in this together, folks.
[01:29:26.684 --> 01:29:29.686]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:30.607 --> 01:29:33.289]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:38.496 --> 01:29:42.918]  Republican legislators are threatening to remove Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's protection detail.
[01:29:43.238 --> 01:29:52.601]  The Democrat governor, former campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, and his attorney general are eager to enact new gun control laws without involvement from the legislature.
[01:29:52.981 --> 01:29:58.943]  So Attorney General Haring announced that he would no longer recognize concealed carry permits from 25 states.
[01:29:59.564 --> 01:30:00.464]  Just like that.
[01:30:01.184 --> 01:30:08.826]  One guy tells the most law-abiding, most vetted people, you can no longer protect yourself, protect your family.
[01:30:09.106 --> 01:30:14.008]  He implies these 25 other states don't have the same standards of background checks that Virginia does.
[01:30:14.608 --> 01:30:15.148]  Not true.
[01:30:15.748 --> 01:30:23.150]  So Republicans in the Virginia legislature are saying, if the governor is so afraid of guns, we're not going to surround him with armed state policemen.
[01:30:23.490 --> 01:30:25.631]  And the people in Virginia need to tell the governor,
[01:30:25.871 --> 01:30:32.439]  That if he won't allow them to protect themselves, they're not going to pay for him to be protected by an army of bodyguards.

[01:31:36.696 --> 01:31:43.524]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[01:31:43.604 --> 01:31:46.328]  We've always offered five months free.
[01:31:46.508 --> 01:31:52.055]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[01:31:52.415 --> 01:31:55.576]  PrisonPlanet.tv began 15 years ago.
[01:31:55.836 --> 01:31:58.817]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.

[01:33:02.512 --> 01:33:04.773]  Let's hear Congressman Coon one more time.
[01:33:04.793 --> 01:33:06.675]  We played this yesterday, but it's such a big deal.
[01:33:07.175 --> 01:33:17.801]  It's so ridiculous, it's so evil, that I thought we'd play it one more time, because I don't want to just talk about it in the last segment and then not actually play it, if you're a new listener or somebody that missed the show yesterday.
[01:33:18.142 --> 01:33:28.448]  They are all over TV, by the way, promoting a new national tax, on top of all the other taxes, to quote, fight ISIS, when the criminals that run our government
[01:33:29.491 --> 01:33:31.752]  are on record creating the whole thing.
[01:33:32.553 --> 01:33:37.436]  And our own Pentagon has had four generals come out and say they were ordered to, and that it was wrong.
[01:33:39.637 --> 01:33:40.818]  And the media has tried to spin it.
[01:33:40.898 --> 01:33:46.921]  We just keep hammering this point because this is one of the stories, one of the levers that could bring these people down.
[01:33:46.941 --> 01:33:48.402]  Let me show you the article.
[01:33:48.462 --> 01:33:49.383]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:33:51.462 --> 01:33:55.767]  We'll put it back on screen where the congressman has come out and done this.
[01:33:56.628 --> 01:33:59.311]  Senator Chris Coons, Democrat from Delaware.
[01:34:00.192 --> 01:34:02.334]  And this is what the establishment is pushing.
[01:34:02.715 --> 01:34:04.297]  This is what is being put out.
[01:34:04.497 --> 01:34:05.098]  Let's go to the clip.
[01:34:06.735 --> 01:34:16.000]  President Obama sent us an AUMF, that's Washington Speak, for a request for a declaration of war against ISIS, all the way back in February.
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:19.121]  And we have not taken it up, debated it, and passed it.
[01:34:19.542 --> 01:34:23.664]  And we owe that to our veterans and to those serving in the conflict against ISIS.
[01:34:24.004 --> 01:34:27.466]  But we also need to stand up and say, how are we going to pay for it?
[01:34:28.006 --> 01:34:33.369]  All the previous wars, as you referenced, before Iraq and Afghanistan, had a dedicated war surtax.
[01:34:33.829 --> 01:34:43.833]  And I think that's one way we could fairly pay for it with a small surtax that exempted active duty military families and veterans, but there's other ways we could pay for it.
[01:34:43.893 --> 01:34:47.195]  We just can't keep going without even discussing it.
[01:34:47.415 --> 01:34:53.918]  Senator, the surtax idea makes sense logically, but then you run into a small, and this is just to play devil's advocate, you run into a small problem which is
[01:34:54.378 --> 01:34:57.600]  It's really, really difficult to actually budget for wars.
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:05.203]  For instance, the initial projections for the cost of the Iraq war, I believe, were 50 to 60 billion dollars, and it being well over a trillion dollars.
[01:35:05.524 --> 01:35:07.665]  So what happens when that surtax isn't enough?
[01:35:07.885 --> 01:35:10.286]  What happens when you have to go back to the well?
[01:35:11.829 --> 01:35:18.453]  Well, you literally can adjust the amount of the surtax annually in order to meet the needs of that specific conflict.
[01:35:19.353 --> 01:35:21.855]  It, frankly, will make members of Congress hesitate.
[01:35:22.395 --> 01:35:24.056]  There's a whole lot... Alright, let's stop right there.
[01:35:24.916 --> 01:35:27.798]  And again, I asked this question back four years ago when Benghazi happened.
[01:35:27.838 --> 01:35:33.261]  I said, when they turn al-Qaeda loose all over the world, overthrow Libya, you name it, Syria, Egypt, Iraq...
[01:35:34.653 --> 01:35:38.216]  Do they think we're so dumb then when they let them into the West and they attack us?
[01:35:38.276 --> 01:35:39.918]  This is a real giant Al-Qaeda army.
[01:35:40.398 --> 01:35:42.540]  Al-Qaeda before was like three to five thousand people.
[01:35:43.801 --> 01:35:45.122]  Riddled with Western intelligence.
[01:35:45.583 --> 01:35:46.323]  A wind-up toy.
[01:35:46.404 --> 01:35:51.108]  Now they went out and recruited giant real armies of psychos and scum and crazies.
[01:35:52.608 --> 01:35:53.909]  And they let them fly back and forth.
[01:35:53.929 --> 01:35:55.109]  They let them have training bases.
[01:35:55.149 --> 01:35:56.309]  They let them get taxpayer money.
[01:35:56.990 --> 01:36:00.291]  Because when they come here and attack stuff, folks, they're going to take our guns.
[01:36:01.171 --> 01:36:02.712]  They're going to take veterans' guns.
[01:36:02.752 --> 01:36:05.713]  They're going to come after our money.
[01:36:05.773 --> 01:36:07.574]  They're going to put naked body scanners in.
[01:36:07.614 --> 01:36:11.976]  They're going to militarize the country and point it at the Patriots for the takeover.
[01:36:11.996 --> 01:36:16.077]  And they keep saying, our number one threat is not radical Islam.
[01:36:16.157 --> 01:36:18.618]  These attacks in San Bernardino are not radical Islam.
[01:36:19.038 --> 01:36:20.019]  It is the Patriots.
[01:36:21.072 --> 01:36:21.612]  The veteran.
[01:36:22.332 --> 01:36:23.192]  The returning veteran.
[01:36:23.552 --> 01:36:24.113]  The Christian.
[01:36:24.353 --> 01:36:25.013]  The conservative.
[01:36:25.193 --> 01:36:25.893]  The libertarian.
[01:36:26.153 --> 01:36:26.713]  The patriot.
[01:36:28.953 --> 01:36:31.414]  There are articles every week claiming I'm calling for violence.
[01:36:32.254 --> 01:36:36.175]  There are articles constantly claiming I want people to attack the government.
[01:36:36.675 --> 01:36:38.055]  That I want cops dead.
[01:36:38.895 --> 01:36:41.175]  The exact opposite of what I've said for 20 years.
[01:36:43.676 --> 01:36:44.696]  And why do you think that is?
[01:36:44.756 --> 01:36:46.136]  Because they're priming the pump.
[01:36:46.996 --> 01:36:49.757]  Remember that Democrat memo that Fox News even covered three years ago?
[01:36:51.294 --> 01:36:54.535]  Where they said, don't worry, Obama's not going to be in political trouble for re-election.
[01:36:54.835 --> 01:36:56.555]  And in the future, Democrats are going to take over.
[01:36:56.876 --> 01:36:57.436]  Don't worry.
[01:36:58.176 --> 01:37:00.376]  Because there's going to be terror attacks in America.
[01:37:01.617 --> 01:37:04.478]  And the conservatives and libertarians are going to get in big trouble for them.
[01:37:06.938 --> 01:37:10.139]  High-level, billionaire, millionaire, Democrat donors.
[01:37:10.159 --> 01:37:11.539]  I ought to find that newscast.
[01:37:11.559 --> 01:37:12.380]  Glenn Beck talked about it.
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:18.321]  And it said in the memos, blame people like Glenn Beck.
[01:37:19.542 --> 01:37:20.642]  I'm not an enemy of Glenn Beck.
[01:37:22.423 --> 01:37:24.944]  I want Glenn Beck to succeed and to be a good guy.
[01:37:26.484 --> 01:37:30.166]  It's good to have other people talking about the New World Order and pro-Second Amendment and family.
[01:37:31.146 --> 01:37:36.708]  I just don't like the fact that he's said so many things about me over the years that aren't true and misrepresented.
[01:37:36.728 --> 01:37:40.709]  I remember for months he'd say, I'm going to expose there's no FEMA camps.
[01:37:42.490 --> 01:37:43.510]  Or we'll see if there are real.
[01:37:43.530 --> 01:37:44.370]  We'll have the big announcement.
[01:37:44.610 --> 01:37:46.071]  He kept making jokes about it and I said,
[01:37:47.998 --> 01:37:49.619]  I waited until the day it was going to air.
[01:37:49.659 --> 01:37:50.100]  The day before.
[01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:51.641]  I didn't want them to just tailor it to what I said.
[01:37:51.681 --> 01:37:52.321]  I knew it.
[01:37:52.341 --> 01:38:02.208]  And I said, they're going to go show hoax videos of railway stations and stuff in Illinois and other places that I've seen for, you know, a decade with tens of millions of views on YouTube.
[01:38:02.228 --> 01:38:05.531]  If I'd seen them before YouTube, I'd be sitting at the VHS.
[01:38:05.791 --> 01:38:07.432]  Why don't you cover this FEMA camp?
[01:38:08.673 --> 01:38:09.614]  And I'd say, we've been there.
[01:38:09.654 --> 01:38:10.454]  It's a railway station.
[01:38:10.474 --> 01:38:11.055]  It's not a FEMA camp.
[01:38:12.095 --> 01:38:15.158]  And then he came on and said, Alex Jones believes that this is a FEMA camp.
[01:38:15.198 --> 01:38:15.498]  It's not.
[01:38:16.298 --> 01:38:17.059]  See, it's a straw man.
[01:38:20.063 --> 01:38:21.684]  Just like Donald Trump hates all Mexicans.
[01:38:21.784 --> 01:38:24.566]  No, Donald Trump said, we've got to screen people coming in.
[01:38:24.606 --> 01:38:25.967]  We can't offer everything free.
[01:38:26.507 --> 01:38:27.768]  We're collapsing as a nation.
[01:38:27.808 --> 01:38:28.468]  We can't do this.
[01:38:28.528 --> 01:38:29.689]  That's what Donald Trump really said.
[01:38:31.130 --> 01:38:33.691]  And the reason I talk about myself is to defend the idea.
[01:38:33.811 --> 01:38:35.232]  What we cover is under attack.
[01:38:35.312 --> 01:38:36.793]  The truth we tell is under attack.
[01:38:37.153 --> 01:38:39.355]  And the way they attack truth is they don't attack the truth.
[01:38:39.615 --> 01:38:43.717]  They build a straw man, a facsimile.
[01:38:46.879 --> 01:38:47.780]  And they go after that.
[01:38:53.476 --> 01:38:54.357]  And that's what they're doing today.
[01:38:55.117 --> 01:38:58.260]  I want to go to these articles now that we haven't detailed yet.
[01:39:00.141 --> 01:39:00.942]  But it is a big deal.
[01:39:00.962 --> 01:39:04.025]  Steve Watson wrote the story, Iraqi commander claims that U.S.
[01:39:04.065 --> 01:39:06.446]  secretly evacuated ISIS leaders to safety.
[01:39:06.707 --> 01:39:11.230]  And then I show you NBC where they were ordered to do that on record in 2001.
[01:39:11.631 --> 01:39:14.173]  It's called the airlift of evil.
[01:39:14.973 --> 01:39:21.298]  This is our government moving the fighters leadership around to then have real wars with our troops and others.
[01:39:21.739 --> 01:39:22.840]  You're like, well, how's that work?
[01:39:23.965 --> 01:39:49.830]  If you're a global government, and you're playing countries off against each other, and you own defense complexes in the UK, France, Germany, Russia, Japan, China, you want to sell weapons, you want to have destabilization, you go fund radical Islam, it scoops up a bunch of poor people, brainwashes them, for 50 years the State Department on record, look at the Washington Post,
[01:39:50.794 --> 01:40:09.014]  I forget the exact headline, it was like, State Department Funds Radical Madrasas Worldwide, and the article admitted for, you know, 40-something years they've done it, now it's 50-something, and it showed that the millions of books shipped to Pakistan and other areas, millions, that show two hand grenades plus two hand grenades equals four hand grenades.
[01:40:10.575 --> 01:40:15.922]  And 3 AK-47s plus 7 AK-47s equals 10 AK-47s.
[01:40:16.883 --> 01:40:23.711]  And then 3 AK-47 clips plus 9 AK-47 clips makes 12 AK-47 clips.
[01:40:23.771 --> 01:40:26.815]  I mean, this is their whole... And our government funds it!
[01:40:27.856 --> 01:40:30.039]  So we can now mow them down and kill them all.
[01:40:32.827 --> 01:40:36.708]  There it is, Islamists as Terrorism Experts, State Department Funding, Madrasas in Nigeria.
[01:40:36.728 --> 01:40:38.848]  That's a new article out of Breitbart last year.
[01:40:39.248 --> 01:40:41.109]  I'm talking Washington Post 15 years ago.
[01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.769]  You can pull it up.
[01:40:43.589 --> 01:40:58.773]  I mean, see, another reason the show's so popular, on TV especially, but radio as well, is that if you're a radio listener, as I talk, we've got like five people in there, and a couple of them just sit there and type in whatever I say, and then just pull up news articles.
[01:41:01.738 --> 01:41:02.999]  And it's usually worse than I say.
[01:41:03.159 --> 01:41:12.567]  I can say two hours of television viewing or more a day is linked to a multi-thousand percentage point increase in Alzheimer's.
[01:41:13.368 --> 01:41:14.569]  And it's actually way higher than that.
[01:41:16.503 --> 01:41:24.787]  Or, drinking 1.6 parts per million or 1.3 parts per million of fluoride for more than three years during adolescence lowers IQ on average 12 points.
[01:41:25.487 --> 01:41:27.108]  And we looked it up, other studies said even higher.
[01:41:27.188 --> 01:41:29.529]  I mean, you know, I get why they want to attack.
[01:41:29.569 --> 01:41:30.669]  I mean, I'm just here.
[01:41:31.069 --> 01:41:32.490]  Oh, here's the flu shot insert.
[01:41:32.970 --> 01:41:33.890]  Says it can kill you.
[01:41:34.191 --> 01:41:37.072]  Says it can give you type 1 diabetes by destroying your pancreas.
[01:41:37.412 --> 01:41:39.493]  Here, uh, says it can cause narcolepsy.
[01:41:46.681 --> 01:41:47.081]  There it is.
[01:41:47.542 --> 01:41:48.722]  There's a report for Congress.
[01:41:49.503 --> 01:41:49.723]  U.S.
[01:41:49.743 --> 01:41:50.944]  government funding madrasas.
[01:41:54.506 --> 01:41:55.527]  I've never even seen that report.
[01:41:55.687 --> 01:41:56.847]  Pull back to that to the top, please.
[01:41:59.609 --> 01:42:01.010]  CRS report to Congress.
[01:42:03.511 --> 01:42:05.633]  Islamic religious schools, madrasas, background.
[01:42:06.033 --> 01:42:09.955]  And our government is building billions of them a year with taxpayer money in the U.S.
[01:42:10.876 --> 01:42:13.698]  And they don't even tell people they're about to go to an Islamic school.
[01:42:14.881 --> 01:42:21.643]  Now, there are a lot of Scientologists that set up, you know, these learning centers and all this, and they'll tell you they're Scientologists, and I don't particularly like that.
[01:42:22.763 --> 01:42:27.504]  But you see all these TV shows about what they're doing, but nothing about what the Islamics are doing.
[01:42:27.524 --> 01:42:35.306]  And oh, and the cause celeb liberals are just all over writing articles, and just, oh, Alex Jones is pushing Islamophobia.
[01:42:35.426 --> 01:42:36.826]  Oh my gosh, it's so horrible.
[01:42:37.626 --> 01:42:40.767]  Oh, I'm the guy that exposed 9-11 before it happened, two months before.
[01:42:40.807 --> 01:42:42.127]  I'm the guy that exposed the day it happened.
[01:42:42.388 --> 01:42:43.728]  I'm the guy that fought all these wars.
[01:42:44.588 --> 01:42:56.857]  And now they want to flood us with the jihad fighters they've created to totally take our liberties, and you're too busy going, no, there's no radical Islam, no one wants to kill us, Alex is lying, he's a neocon, he wants war!
[01:42:57.278 --> 01:43:10.348]  They're gonna use these people when they start shooting and blowing stuff up, like I told you a few years ago, now it's started, to take our freedoms and launch big wars in the Middle East to kill innocent people and take over regimes that aren't radical.
[01:43:11.181 --> 01:43:14.225]  And now they're blaming Assad for ISIS, saying take out Assad.
[01:43:14.485 --> 01:43:16.267]  Now they're saying take over Iraq again.
[01:43:17.849 --> 01:43:20.873]  Saudi Arabia was involved in 9-11, we attacked Iraq!
[01:43:21.694 --> 01:43:27.821]  You shniveling leftist scum, pseudo-intellectuals, you want to sit here and claim I don't have integrity?
[01:43:28.201 --> 01:43:30.985]  You're the ones that don't have brains to get what's going on!
[01:43:34.329 --> 01:43:35.550]  The globalists want our guns.
[01:43:35.690 --> 01:43:36.271]  I'm against it.
[01:43:36.311 --> 01:43:37.471]  The globalists want open borders.
[01:43:37.532 --> 01:43:38.072]  I'm against it.
[01:43:38.272 --> 01:43:53.104]  The globalists want to flood the western world with millions of refugees a year from war-torn Syria, a bunch of invaders who are going to attack us like the sun came up this morning, and you want to shoot your mouths off and claim that I want to kill Muslims and brown people.
[01:43:54.044 --> 01:43:57.667]  Is that why I'm against the polio shot forum filled with sterilants?
[01:44:00.369 --> 01:44:03.112]  See, you have to be sophisticated enough to go,
[01:44:04.446 --> 01:44:19.735]  I don't want to sterilize all the Latin American women with Gardasil shots, forcibly given to them, but at the same time, I don't want them to come up here and be filled full of leftist control brainwashing and vote to take my guns in a race-based politic.
[01:44:20.195 --> 01:44:32.783]  See, I love them, I like them, I want them to succeed, I want them to be successful, I want Mexico to be free, and if it ends up being a freer and better country than America?
[01:44:33.823 --> 01:44:34.683]  I'll move there.
[01:44:36.544 --> 01:44:38.685]  I'll go be surrounded by brown people.
[01:44:39.385 --> 01:44:43.366]  I like brown people, but I shouldn't have to sit here and explain I do.
[01:44:44.286 --> 01:44:51.629]  I'm not gonna have giant, poor hordes of people brought in as a weapon by the New World Order against me and my family.
[01:44:53.929 --> 01:44:55.010]  And it's the same thing.
[01:44:57.410 --> 01:45:01.192]  I don't want Chechens being brought to this country, and they're basically Anglo.
[01:45:01.792 --> 01:45:02.232]  Slavic.
[01:45:04.721 --> 01:45:11.544]  Because large portions of them are terrorists, and are going to get wound up, and are going to attack, and then my freedoms are going to be taken, and your freedoms are going to be taken.
[01:45:11.704 --> 01:45:12.325]  It's real simple.
[01:45:14.486 --> 01:45:19.228]  Oh, you think I'm promoting the clash of civilizations when I popularized the white paper?
[01:45:19.688 --> 01:45:20.149]  Literally?
[01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:24.531]  PNAC was the first to cover it.
[01:45:29.229 --> 01:45:34.854]  The clash of civilizations is bringing radical Muslims in to then demonize all other Muslims.
[01:45:35.094 --> 01:45:37.636]  You go, wait, the left is talking point is all Muslims aren't radical.
[01:45:37.656 --> 01:45:38.277]  A lot of them are nice.
[01:45:38.477 --> 01:45:39.158]  This is a minority.
[01:45:39.338 --> 01:45:40.939]  Well, yeah, that part is pretty much true.
[01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:49.947]  But what they don't tell you is they are radicalizing the Muslims and the globalists are running a program to take over the Middle East with Stone Age radical Islam.
[01:45:52.768 --> 01:46:05.860]  Revolutionary, first stage Islam, going back to Muhammad, when it was expanding militaristically, to then have a clash, crush it, and crush us in the process with the response to it.
[01:46:06.081 --> 01:46:08.323]  Just like the globalists created the Soviet Union.
[01:46:08.783 --> 01:46:09.744]  That's declassified.
[01:46:09.984 --> 01:46:11.966]  Just like they funded the whole stinking thing.
[01:46:12.627 --> 01:46:16.711]  So that when this great evil rose up, they'd have a pretext to have us counter something else.
[01:46:24.821 --> 01:46:32.007]  Let me get to something else here for just a moment, and then I'm going to get into the other really important news on the NSA, the economy, the Supreme Court, and more.
[01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:35.210]  We're offering a big discount.
[01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:36.511]  Folks love discounts.
[01:46:37.051 --> 01:46:38.453]  And we have a lot of specials running as well.
[01:46:39.333 --> 01:46:44.117]  15% off on anybody that used gift 15 promo code at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:46:44.378 --> 01:46:49.082]  They started out saying, hey, if you have a gift card, a lot of folks just give people cash cards.
[01:46:50.350 --> 01:46:53.771]  But most gift cards are proprietary to only certain stores, and people got confused by it.
[01:46:53.811 --> 01:47:00.573]  So look, gift 15, use your unused gift card, and use gift 15, get 50% discount on top of it.
[01:47:00.854 --> 01:47:03.634]  It's better just throwing the money away, get high quality products, fund the Liberty Movement.
[01:47:03.654 --> 01:47:05.755]  I mean, that's a win-win at every point of the compass.
[01:47:07.536 --> 01:47:08.696]  But let's go past all that.
[01:47:08.716 --> 01:47:12.698]  15% off on everything.
[01:47:13.238 --> 01:47:16.899]  Shortwave radios, high quality water filtration systems, everything.
[01:47:18.578 --> 01:47:23.422]  The Hillary for Prison t-shirts, we're not making any more, but when these sell out, that's it.
[01:47:23.983 --> 01:47:24.683]  Very popular.
[01:47:24.823 --> 01:47:25.484]  Trump's tweeted it.
[01:47:26.545 --> 01:47:30.428]  Wish I wouldn't have said it was limited edition, but I do that every once in a while with a shirt, so it is limited edition.
[01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:44.079]  And separately, I don't talk enough about the great nutraceuticals and Infowarslife.com, the ones that we produced, created with Dr. Group and several other big laboratories in the country.
[01:47:44.099 --> 01:47:44.640]  They're cutting edge.
[01:47:46.135 --> 01:47:49.796]  But I really don't talk enough about InfoWarsHealth.com or InfoWarsTeam.com.
[01:47:49.816 --> 01:47:50.616]  People say, what is that?
[01:47:50.917 --> 01:47:52.277]  Why do you have InfoWarsLife.com?
[01:47:52.897 --> 01:47:53.758]  But then you have these other sites.
[01:47:53.778 --> 01:47:56.738]  Well, InfoWarsHealth.com is longevity.
[01:47:57.999 --> 01:48:05.661]  And they really do have the widest spectrum of high quality products with the highest standards you're going to find out there.
[01:48:06.642 --> 01:48:13.004]  Their Beyond Tangy Tangerine Totally Organic 2.0 is the only major truly organic super
[01:48:14.682 --> 01:48:15.362]  Drink out there.
[01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:18.603]  It's got all the vitamins, all the minerals, all the proper type.

[01:48:19.784 --> 01:48:25.405]  And I'm telling you, the way the diet is, the depleted soils, I guarantee no matter how much good food you're eating, everybody is deficient in something.
[01:48:26.005 --> 01:48:30.427]  And it really helped me starting five years ago on my journey to lose almost 60 pounds.
[01:48:31.247 --> 01:48:32.767]  And it's something I take every day.
[01:48:32.807 --> 01:48:33.608]  My children take it.
[01:48:33.708 --> 01:48:41.190]  And I just want you to know, when you go to InfoWarsHealth.com and you purchase it there, some of the proceeds go to fund the InfoWar.

[01:49:53.427 --> 01:49:58.852]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, it comes down to the fact a lot of informational videos on the sites and more.
[01:49:58.872 --> 01:50:05.897]  In fact, I meant to show you it was in the BBC yesterday that scurvy is making a comeback in the Western world.
[01:50:06.838 --> 01:50:09.140]  I mean if you eat one orange a week folks, you won't have that.
[01:50:11.019 --> 01:50:12.600]  It's like Ted Anderson's dad who just passed.
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:17.861]  They told him, don't eat fruits and vegetables because we've got you on blood thinner, even though he never had a stroke or any problem.
[01:50:17.881 --> 01:50:18.621]  He died of Alzheimer's.
[01:50:19.582 --> 01:50:21.442]  They tried to take him, but he didn't take a transrine for a few months.
[01:50:21.462 --> 01:50:22.422]  He knew who he was again.
[01:50:22.602 --> 01:50:24.263]  The doctor said, I find vitamin K in your blood.
[01:50:24.343 --> 01:50:24.803]  Take it out.
[01:50:25.603 --> 01:50:27.144]  So he stopped drinking it and then died.
[01:50:27.664 --> 01:50:28.684]  Ted, let me tell that story.
[01:50:28.704 --> 01:50:29.024]  It's true.
[01:50:29.064 --> 01:50:31.165]  I mean, that's the owner of the network.
[01:50:31.185 --> 01:50:32.805]  I mean, this is how crazy this is.

[01:53:06.109 --> 01:53:08.870]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:53:09.170 --> 01:53:11.771]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:53:11.812 --> 01:53:12.232]  Croix River.
[01:53:12.552 --> 01:53:14.553]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:53:14.773 --> 01:53:17.494]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:53:17.734 --> 01:53:18.254]  His excuse?
[01:53:18.614 --> 01:53:19.675]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:53:19.955 --> 01:53:21.236]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:53:21.556 --> 01:53:27.058]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[01:53:27.318 --> 01:53:28.059]  Don't wait.
[01:53:28.359 --> 01:53:30.720]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now.

[01:53:52.384 --> 01:53:59.947]  We're now taking live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:54:00.087 --> 01:54:02.548]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:02.608 --> 01:54:03.309]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:54:05.890 --> 01:54:07.690]  Ty Hirsch is coming up.
[01:54:08.771 --> 01:54:12.072]  Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner to expose so much of what's happening.
[01:54:12.112 --> 01:54:14.353]  He's in a trout, I'm sure, to be very conservative in what he says.
[01:54:14.373 --> 01:54:20.075]  He's under a ton of scrutiny and has been really persecuted for exposing that the Bin Laden raid narrative was quote 100% false.
[01:54:22.662 --> 01:54:23.442]  And so much more.
[01:54:24.783 --> 01:54:26.744]  But it will be his first visit with us.
[01:54:26.784 --> 01:54:28.284]  This is a big deal for me.
[01:54:29.305 --> 01:54:31.926]  Because he's one of the greatest living journalists out there.
[01:54:33.086 --> 01:54:36.328]  And I know full well that he follows our work, we follow his work.
[01:54:36.608 --> 01:54:38.188]  It shows how serious our work is.
[01:54:38.689 --> 01:54:43.611]  And yeah, I get up here and wave my arms around because it's not rabble rousing.
[01:54:45.991 --> 01:54:49.413]  If 5,000 years ago, let's say in Europe,
[01:54:50.467 --> 01:54:54.928]  Another tribe was marching in and burning down everything in its path and enslaving everybody.
[01:54:55.528 --> 01:54:58.729]  Folks would rally and men would get up and say, let's go link up with these tribes.
[01:54:58.769 --> 01:55:02.630]  And people give speeches and some would say, let's run to, you know, this area.
[01:55:02.670 --> 01:55:04.010]  That's what so much migration was about.
[01:55:04.350 --> 01:55:05.470]  No, let's stand and fight.
[01:55:06.990 --> 01:55:13.792]  And then people would get up and give their impassioned rants to motivate folks to fight or flight.
[01:55:16.977 --> 01:55:19.558]  I mean I had a cup of coffee this morning at about 7 a.m.
[01:55:19.978 --> 01:55:22.339]  and I've had like half a cup and I was just speeding.
[01:55:25.319 --> 01:55:31.561]  I mean I feel like I felt when the few times I was in high school and people at a party would get me to you know try methamphetamine.
[01:55:31.841 --> 01:55:34.142]  I think I've had it like two or three times and it was that same thing.
[01:55:34.162 --> 01:55:37.443]  I mean I feel like I'm speeding right now and I'm not.
[01:55:37.943 --> 01:55:41.284]  I mean I normally have two cups of coffee by now and it's because stuff is so epic.
[01:55:42.924 --> 01:55:44.985]  Stuff is so incredible I'm like hyperventilating.
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:54.063]  Just because it's all coming out how evil our government is.
[01:55:58.566 --> 01:55:59.647]  And it's not our government.
[01:56:10.219 --> 01:56:18.242]  I'm not going to plug anymore, but I am going to say that we are running this year-end special where you get six months free for the nightly news and all the films when you subscribe to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:18.322 --> 01:56:19.763]  Twenty people can use each membership.
[01:56:20.203 --> 01:56:32.107]  If you want to help us fund the operation and inform yourself and download the films and have hard copies of it and get copies of it for access television in your area, whatever groups you're showing, then please become a PrisonPlanet.tv member today.
[01:56:33.968 --> 01:56:37.109]  And even if you get it and don't use it, whatever, you're funding the operation.
[01:56:38.689 --> 01:56:40.270]  Alright, Cy Hirsch is coming up.
[01:56:40.571 --> 01:56:43.673]  You know, Drudge again told us this when he came here to warn us.
[01:56:46.416 --> 01:56:52.061]  Like Paul Revere, Supreme Court to decide politically charged cases in 2016.
[01:56:52.321 --> 01:56:53.702]  They're coming after the guns.
[01:56:54.443 --> 01:56:55.684]  They're coming to open up the borders.
[01:56:56.244 --> 01:56:57.465]  They're coming to push abortion.
[01:56:57.786 --> 01:56:59.107]  They're coming to restrict free speech.
[01:56:59.207 --> 01:57:00.748]  They've got that liberal majority.
[01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:03.751]  Nothing liberal about it except the name.
[01:57:08.627 --> 01:57:14.988]  And we've got all over the country, the Democrats basically just harassing gun owners, SWAT teaming people for no reason.
[01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:23.510]  The gun confiscations pretty much begun in California and other areas where just if somebody says, well he didn't threaten anybody with a gun, but I just don't think you should have a gun, they come take your guns.
[01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:26.971]  And they say, oh you get them back in, you know, 24 days or whatever.
[01:57:27.471 --> 01:57:32.272]  They've done this in select areas like Chicago, Boston, New York City, D.C.
[01:57:32.392 --> 01:57:37.393]  You don't get the guns back unless you spend, I know people that have spent 50 grand
[01:57:38.658 --> 01:57:40.539]  And three, four years trying to get their guns back.
[01:57:40.679 --> 01:57:43.941]  Usually ten grand a year or two.
[01:57:43.961 --> 01:57:47.383]  A lot of times folks just say, keep them.
[01:57:47.403 --> 01:57:49.944]  And then they go to buy a gun a year later and they take that as an admission of guilt.
[01:57:49.964 --> 01:57:51.305]  They go, sorry, you're in the NICS system.
[01:57:51.525 --> 01:57:52.866]  They didn't put you in the national system.
[01:57:54.127 --> 01:57:55.788]  Well, somebody's got to do something.
[01:57:56.868 --> 01:58:00.210]  I mean, all these shootings, the shootings are down since 1991.
[01:58:03.500 --> 01:58:04.341]  60-plus percent.
[01:58:04.561 --> 01:58:06.842]  I was corrected by Professor Lott.
[01:58:06.922 --> 01:58:07.622]  I said 50-something.
[01:58:07.662 --> 01:58:08.643]  I was going out to the Justice Department.
[01:58:08.663 --> 01:58:09.343]  No, it's 60-plus.
[01:58:10.824 --> 01:58:12.225]  It's all about a monopoly of power.
[01:58:12.265 --> 01:58:17.428]  They want our guns to complete our journey to enslavement, and everybody who's got a brain cell left knows it.
[01:58:18.348 --> 01:58:21.610]  Third hour, coming up in the fourth hour with Leanne McAdoo.
[01:58:22.351 --> 01:58:22.591]  Wonderful.

[01:59:08.656 --> 01:59:11.858]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:59:12.138 --> 01:59:13.938]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.

[01:59:29.713 --> 01:59:32.474]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:39.275 --> 01:59:43.636]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:44.136 --> 01:59:58.879]  Came in last night at half past ten That baby of mine wouldn't let me in So move it on over Move it on over Move it on over Move it on over Move over, little dog, cause the big dog's moving
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:08.763]  She's changed the lock on our front door, and my door key don't fit no more, so get it on over.
[02:00:09.103 --> 02:00:10.364]  Move it on over.
[02:00:10.384 --> 02:00:11.705]  Scoot it on over.
[02:00:11.945 --> 02:00:13.125]  Move it on over.
[02:00:13.145 --> 02:00:16.767]  Move over, skinny dog, cause the fat dog's moving in.
[02:00:16.807 --> 02:00:18.207]  That's right, Cy Hirsch coming up.
[02:00:18.728 --> 02:00:25.591]  This doghouse here is mighty small, but it's better than no house at all, so ease it on over.
[02:00:25.611 --> 02:00:26.571]  Move it on over.
[02:00:26.751 --> 02:00:29.652]  All over the country they're announcing the new coffin apartments.
[02:00:29.672 --> 02:00:30.573]  They call them smart.
[02:00:31.856 --> 02:00:33.097]  Like smart missiles.
[02:00:33.737 --> 02:00:35.618]  They're meant to blow your savings up.
[02:00:36.859 --> 02:00:37.299]  They admit.
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:46.925]  They can build more of them, charge higher rent per square foot, and then get more property tax, where you can pay more in property tax than you do even for rent.
[02:00:46.945 --> 02:00:48.926]  And you're like, what do you mean?
[02:00:48.986 --> 02:00:50.367]  I don't pay property tax, I rent.
[02:00:50.927 --> 02:00:54.449]  Oh, you pay for it through the owner.
[02:00:57.071 --> 02:00:58.031]  Isn't that cute?
[02:00:58.071 --> 02:00:58.572]  It's your new
[02:01:00.134 --> 02:01:05.539]  And they have all these little metrosexual trendies going, I really love it.
[02:01:06.099 --> 02:01:07.040]  Bloomberg promotes it.
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:11.644]  That's why Bloomberg, you know, lives in 30, 40, 50,000 square feet house.
[02:01:11.664 --> 02:01:12.424]  He's got a whole bunch of them.
[02:01:12.464 --> 02:01:14.286]  Al Gore's got houses even bigger.
[02:01:14.306 --> 02:01:15.627]  It's okay though.
[02:01:16.247 --> 02:01:17.628]  They're promoting that you live in here.
[02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:19.770]  Like Obama said, you can't have air conditioning or a car.
[02:01:20.070 --> 02:01:23.153]  Not that we're going to innovate the cars and air conditioning like they've done and make them clean.
[02:01:23.513 --> 02:01:25.235]  No, we're just, you just don't get one.
[02:01:26.618 --> 02:01:30.219]  Now I gotta go back on this Air Force One here and fly back to Hawaii.
[02:01:30.279 --> 02:01:30.579]  Ha ha!
[02:01:30.599 --> 02:01:32.999]  I don't do a very good Obama, I can do a Bush.
[02:01:33.879 --> 02:01:34.320]  Ha, yeah.
[02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:37.580]  Fool me once, shame on you.
[02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:41.841]  Fool me twice, shame on... I have to... It's been so long since I actually watched George W. I can't do it as well.
[02:01:42.121 --> 02:01:42.981]  I can do a Bill Clinton.
[02:01:44.822 --> 02:01:52.303]  I'm here to tell you that I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky, and I did settle, was it five cases of alleged rape, out of court.
[02:01:54.204 --> 02:01:56.264]  You don't think I'd do something like that, do you?
[02:02:00.094 --> 02:02:07.881]  You know, I love the fact that Trump's going after him for all the sex stuff, because he and Bill Cosby deserves it, which he well may.
[02:02:07.901 --> 02:02:10.203]  I think some of it's true, some of it isn't.
[02:02:10.243 --> 02:02:11.404]  But with Bill Clinton, we know.
[02:02:11.424 --> 02:02:15.988]  I mean, I've interviewed the women that he, well, first he'd start choking them.
[02:02:16.788 --> 02:02:17.909]  He'd even do it at like a party.
[02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:21.893]  Or at the governor's mansion, he'd say, step in here, I want to talk to you in my office, please, ma'am.
[02:02:23.029 --> 02:02:31.691]  And then he would get him in a closet and just start choking him and then bite their upper lip while he talked through his mouth, going, I'm gonna rip your lip off if you just resist me.
[02:02:31.711 --> 02:02:32.411]  Do you understand me?
[02:02:33.031 --> 02:02:33.552]  And choke him.
[02:02:35.212 --> 02:02:36.452]  An expert rapist.
[02:02:38.833 --> 02:02:40.393]  But it's okay, because he's liberal.
[02:02:40.673 --> 02:02:43.514]  We imagine that he's our buddy, so then everything's okay.
[02:02:45.888 --> 02:02:51.489]  Sy Hirst joins us for 30 minutes coming up, then Leanne McAdoo, and boy do I have a lot to go over with him.
[02:02:51.509 --> 02:02:53.930]  I want to talk about Iraqi commander claims that U.S.
[02:02:54.430 --> 02:02:57.011]  secretly evacuating ISIS leaders to safety.
[02:02:58.791 --> 02:03:06.053]  I want to get into Congressman Paul appalled by NSA spying on Congress and where all that is going.
[02:03:06.453 --> 02:03:10.994]  I mean, so much to talk about with Sy Hirst, but the big thing is his new book, Military to Military.
[02:03:13.154 --> 02:03:21.859]  And that deals with the fact that our military's been trying as best they can, under orders not to, to stop the radical jihadists.
[02:03:22.239 --> 02:03:31.163]  And of course the State Department wants to keep up the show that they're actually not with them, so that allows that purview, even though it's a fake mission, the military's actually tried to carry out the mission.
[02:03:32.024 --> 02:03:35.966]  So we're going to talk to the expert on this, and of course I've got all my sources as well.
[02:03:36.366 --> 02:03:41.429]  What's amazing is so much of what he's put out in the excerpt of his new book, Military to Military,
[02:03:43.564 --> 02:03:50.008]  Backs up everything that our guests have basically talked about here on air.
[02:03:51.710 --> 02:03:56.273]  So, Cy Hirsch coming up on the other side of this break.
[02:03:57.053 --> 02:03:58.354]  Remember, Matt Drudge was here.
[02:03:58.414 --> 02:03:59.995]  They are pushing to control the Internet.
[02:04:00.416 --> 02:04:01.516]  They're now admitting that in the news.
[02:04:01.556 --> 02:04:04.218]  That's coming up after Cy Hirsch leaves us.
[02:04:04.919 --> 02:04:06.900]  There is a big push to restrict free speech.
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:10.923]  A big push to take over more and more of the freedoms on the Internet.
[02:04:13.590 --> 02:04:14.710]  Chinese-style systems.
[02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:17.151]  So you gotta decide which side you're on right now.
[02:04:18.232 --> 02:04:25.154]  Are you on the side of basic human liberty and freedom and a safe society?
[02:04:25.174 --> 02:04:26.454]  Because that's what's safe, is freedom.
[02:04:26.874 --> 02:04:31.336]  Or you want tyranny, because if you go along with this, that's where it's headed.
[02:04:31.376 --> 02:04:34.677]  I mean, we already see a lot of tyranny, but it's only getting worse by the millisecond, obviously.
[02:04:37.569 --> 02:04:46.496]  Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, went on the Morning Joe Show to call for a small surtax to pay for the war against the Islamic State.
[02:04:46.716 --> 02:04:57.984]  Coons said in addition to authorizing Obama's unconstitutional authorization for use of military force, Congress must levy a new tax on Americans to pay for military action against IS.
[02:04:58.144 --> 02:04:58.624]  The U.S.
[02:04:58.664 --> 02:05:03.108]  has spent more than $5 billion on the war against IS since August 2014.
[02:05:03.708 --> 02:05:06.370]  The cost is expected to rise considerably
[02:05:06.590 --> 02:05:11.153]  Now that the Obama administration has said it will step up the campaign to wipe out the group.
[02:05:11.374 --> 02:05:17.498]  Despite spending billions, the air campaign has failed to weaken the Islamic State, according to intelligence officials.
[02:05:17.738 --> 02:05:29.827]  On Monday, Representative Peter King, a New York Republican who serves as the Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said that after 16 months of airstrikes by the U.S., it's had really minimal impact on ISIS.

[02:07:48.994 --> 02:07:50.855]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:07:51.696 --> 02:07:57.340]  Welcome, my friends, to the third hour and the fourth hour.
[02:07:57.380 --> 02:08:00.323]  We've added Leanne McAdoo, InfoWorks Nightly News Reporter.
[02:08:00.343 --> 02:08:06.848]  We'll be hosting the fourth hour of the radio-slash-TV broadcast that now reaches more than 20 million people a week worldwide.
[02:08:08.561 --> 02:08:18.422]  It's very, very exciting that folks are tuned out of the whole left-right false debate of divide and conquer and are just getting back to freedom versus tyranny and making a choice.
[02:08:20.598 --> 02:08:22.700]  I could interview this individual for five hours.
[02:08:23.041 --> 02:08:27.705]  I mean, we've only got him for like 25 minutes, and I'm so excited.
[02:08:27.846 --> 02:08:33.431]  I mean, there are a lot of guests we've had that get me excited, but I'm about as excited about this as I've ever been about any guest.
[02:08:33.451 --> 02:08:36.294]  So maybe Donald Trump coming on, or Ron Paul, or Matt Drudge.
[02:08:36.775 --> 02:08:38.236]  I mean, it's right up there with that.
[02:08:39.257 --> 02:08:41.219]  Seymour Hersh, I remember growing up.
[02:08:42.485 --> 02:08:52.997]  Uh, you know, uh, at the end of the Vietnam War and hearing my mom, you know, talk about how great Cy Hirsch was and my dad and them reading his articles, uh, in major publications.
[02:08:54.312 --> 02:09:01.562]  And then of course, since I've been out of high school 25 years or so, I'm 42, I've been following his work continually.
[02:09:02.503 --> 02:09:07.029]  I know most of the audience knows who he is, but I've talked to folks who don't know who Chuck Yeager is.
[02:09:07.069 --> 02:09:10.314]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy how ignorant some of the public are.
[02:09:10.654 --> 02:09:11.996]  Not our general audience, but
[02:09:14.246 --> 02:09:19.029]  The new people tuning in every millisecond on close to 200 affiliates across the United States.
[02:09:19.809 --> 02:09:22.931]  He's won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award.
[02:09:23.851 --> 02:09:30.935]  He basically helped expose the biggest massacres in Vietnam and helped pretty much cause a chain reaction that ended that war.
[02:09:30.975 --> 02:09:34.377]  You can't give him full credit for it, but I can say he gets the most credit of one man.
[02:09:35.257 --> 02:09:38.499]  Or, you know, maybe the guy with the Pentagon Papers, who's been on as well.
[02:09:40.347 --> 02:09:44.129]  Then, and I know he doesn't want to be talked about, but I'm going to do this for a minute and then we're going to him.
[02:09:44.429 --> 02:09:47.470]  Just so you know how big his new book is, how important it is.
[02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:50.511]  He exposed the Iraq War as the fraud like no other.
[02:09:51.232 --> 02:09:52.412]  He exposed the NSA.
[02:09:53.372 --> 02:09:54.853]  He has just exposed it all.
[02:09:54.913 --> 02:09:59.775]  He exposed what he called one big lie, not one word of it true, the Osama Bin Laden raid.
[02:10:00.315 --> 02:10:03.056]  And he has been demonized, attacked, you name it.
[02:10:03.097 --> 02:10:05.017]  But the truth stands on its own.
[02:10:05.057 --> 02:10:06.118]  That's a badge of courage.
[02:10:06.980 --> 02:10:12.005]  And so we've had former NSA technical director William Binion, so many big people.
[02:10:12.025 --> 02:10:15.849]  I don't know if you'd call Cy Hirsch a whistleblower, but he's beyond that.
[02:10:15.929 --> 02:10:23.817]  He's probably, undoubtedly, the greatest living investigative journalist, and he joins us now on his maiden voyage, hopefully one of many.
[02:10:23.837 --> 02:10:28.421]  I know we've talked in email a few times over the years, and my writers have, but he joins us now.
[02:10:28.442 --> 02:10:29.603]  Mr. Hirsch, thank you for coming on.
[02:10:30.273 --> 02:10:33.096]  Yeah, but you better tell people we're not related after that introduction.
[02:10:33.116 --> 02:10:35.478]  You're not my brother-in-law, are you?
[02:10:35.498 --> 02:10:36.700]  You know it's true, come on.
[02:10:39.242 --> 02:10:40.203]  You know something?
[02:10:40.383 --> 02:10:44.628]  It's the day before New Year's Eve, it's quiet here in my office, I'm sitting here like a mouse.
[02:10:45.609 --> 02:10:47.331]  You know, I don't feel so important today.
[02:10:48.646 --> 02:10:49.787]  Well, it's amazing, sir.
[02:10:50.547 --> 02:11:00.675]  Obviously, we're here to talk about the latest info, your book, Military to Military, the incredible stuff happening in Syria, really showing the soul of America, both good, bad, and ugly.
[02:11:01.056 --> 02:11:06.259]  But first off, in the continuum of your 40-plus years of reporting, sir,
[02:11:07.140 --> 02:11:11.667]  Looking at all this, is America getting more corrupt or less, or do we just know more now?
[02:11:12.148 --> 02:11:13.711]  Or are elites getting more brazen?
[02:11:13.751 --> 02:11:20.541]  I mean, tying your latest reportage into the things you've seen, what is the state of the world through your rose-colored darkly?
[02:11:21.243 --> 02:11:22.924]  Well, you know, it's interesting you ask that question.
[02:11:22.944 --> 02:11:31.048]  I would say right now that the guys who control the press, the ability to manipulate the press, is much greater than ever.
[02:11:31.628 --> 02:11:40.313]  And even the very good newspapers are staggering under the idea that it's just really hard to take everything at face value.
[02:11:40.333 --> 02:11:44.075]  The current press secretary for the President of the United States,
[02:11:44.875 --> 02:11:47.477]  Maybe a perfectly nice guy, but he never worked as a journalist.
[02:11:47.517 --> 02:11:50.259]  He was always in the public relations business.
[02:11:50.359 --> 02:11:55.662]  I'm not suggesting he's criminal or wrong, but we don't even have a journalist there.
[02:11:55.682 --> 02:12:01.565]  So yes, I would say things are worse off generally, just in terms of day-to-day credibility.
[02:12:02.025 --> 02:12:04.267]  It's just so much easier for the guys on top.
[02:12:05.521 --> 02:12:11.863]  To get away with, if not a falsehood, just an incomplete answer or a non-answer when one should be issued.
[02:12:12.983 --> 02:12:13.923]  I think it's much worse.
[02:12:15.643 --> 02:12:22.545]  I just, you know, now if you go to the White House or to the Pentagon for comment, it's sort of pro forma.
[02:12:22.585 --> 02:12:23.345]  You're just doing it.
[02:12:23.825 --> 02:12:28.066]  And there's a line there, the Pentagon today denied or refused a comment.
[02:12:28.906 --> 02:12:32.687]  You just don't get help on stories that are adverse to the government anymore.
[02:12:33.962 --> 02:12:35.263]  Cy Hirsch is our guest.
[02:12:35.283 --> 02:12:49.277]  I mean, I think one of the quintessential moments was a few years ago when Gibbs had left as White House Press Secretary and he went on MSNBC and said, yeah, you know, we knew the drone program was public and public for years, but we were told to go out there and say it didn't exist.
[02:12:49.737 --> 02:12:51.018]  This is like the Wizard of Oz.
[02:12:51.118 --> 02:12:53.020]  And then the pundits all laughed about it.
[02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:57.404]  It's almost like it's funny now that they've put us into a false reality.
[02:12:57.644 --> 02:12:58.926]  They just hide it in plain view.
[02:13:00.305 --> 02:13:19.833]  Well, you remember the current president joked that if his daughters are getting to be of dating age... I mean, look, there's nothing wrong with humor, but you have to sort of... It was at one of these annual meetings where the National Press Club gives the White House Correspondents' Dinner, which I think is sort of a scandal.
[02:13:20.233 --> 02:13:26.515]  The press all fight to see which guy can be at their table, which person from the government, and it's sort of like kumbaya.
[02:13:26.915 --> 02:13:28.476]  But the president actually said that
[02:13:29.156 --> 02:13:32.238]  Guys better watch when they're dating his daughters.
[02:13:33.318 --> 02:13:35.260]  A very attractive woman, young woman.
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:38.861]  He said they better watch out because he can always schedule a drone strike.
[02:13:39.442 --> 02:13:40.602]  I thought that was, wow.
[02:13:41.123 --> 02:13:42.243]  Are you kidding me?
[02:13:43.204 --> 02:13:45.885]  You know, that's over the line, it seems to me.
[02:13:46.146 --> 02:13:47.106]  It's not professional.
[02:13:47.126 --> 02:13:56.871]  I mean, it's like Hillary saying we came, we saw, he died in Libya and laughing and then having her Brian Williams moment, claiming she was attacked in Bosnia on the tarmac.
[02:13:56.891 --> 02:13:57.472]  None of it's true.
[02:13:58.260 --> 02:14:02.504]  You got me on the, I'll tell you, you're singing my song about Libya.
[02:14:02.524 --> 02:14:04.206]  I just can't believe we didn't learn from that.
[02:14:04.706 --> 02:14:10.551]  Which is, you know, and by the way, just to clear up the record, the article, the Military to Military, it's just an article, it's a long article I wrote.
[02:14:11.232 --> 02:14:12.513]  I'm doing a book, but not about that.
[02:14:12.533 --> 02:14:13.574]  I'm doing a book about Cheney.
[02:14:13.894 --> 02:14:17.478]  But I did write that article for the London Review of Books, which is a great magazine.
[02:14:17.898 --> 02:14:18.719]  And you know, it turns out,
[02:14:20.061 --> 02:14:21.742]  Because of what you guys do, the Internet.
[02:14:21.762 --> 02:14:23.304]  The Internet is so lively.
[02:14:23.624 --> 02:14:25.787]  It doesn't really matter where you publish anymore.
[02:14:25.887 --> 02:14:30.652]  Thirty years ago, if you weren't at the New York Times, you felt like you were sort of, you know, or the Washington Post.
[02:14:30.672 --> 02:14:32.533]  But now, you know, it's just out there.
[02:14:32.574 --> 02:14:34.055]  Things get out there automatically.
[02:14:34.355 --> 02:14:35.236]  So that's good.
[02:14:35.717 --> 02:14:37.358]  We have more, better communication.
[02:14:37.378 --> 02:14:39.360]  It's just too bad we don't have better information.
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:40.682]  Sure, so that's bringing some balance back.
[02:14:40.702 --> 02:14:42.604]  But there is a glut, and I'm aware of your big...
[02:14:42.964 --> 02:14:43.885]  We're good to go.
[02:15:10.346 --> 02:15:19.718]  Walking us through it, sir, and your incredible article, Military to Military, explain to us, as best you can tell, what has really happened in Syria.
[02:15:20.365 --> 02:15:25.910]  Well, the big issue is, one of the big questions is, we've demonized Bashar Assad.
[02:15:26.130 --> 02:15:27.632]  He's a dictator, no question.
[02:15:28.372 --> 02:15:30.014]  You cross him, he'll cross you.
[02:15:30.354 --> 02:15:35.199]  He's a lot better than his father, the old man Assad, you know, Hafez Assad.
[02:15:35.739 --> 02:15:41.865]  He was trained to be, he was the second or third son, never thought he'd be president because the older boys had the past.
[02:15:42.545 --> 02:15:53.977]  He went to medical school, was an ophthalmologist, married a very second-generation Iraqi woman who worked for one of the national investment houses, American investment houses in London.
[02:15:54.438 --> 02:16:01.485]  And so all of a sudden he's called upon, his older brother dies, and his father says, you better get a couple years of Army training and get ready.
[02:16:05.936 --> 02:16:07.038]  He's hated in America.
[02:16:07.058 --> 02:16:09.161]  I don't think you can get five votes for him in Congress.
[02:16:09.501 --> 02:16:10.302]  He's demonized.
[02:16:10.382 --> 02:16:12.045]  He's killed.
[02:16:12.065 --> 02:16:13.287]  There's about 250,000 deaths.
[02:16:13.307 --> 02:16:14.809]  But he's a lot better than Al Qaeda.
[02:16:15.475 --> 02:16:20.960]  Well, you know something, and ISIS, and also, things have, I watched them for 6, 8, 10 years.
[02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:22.041]  I went back and forth there.
[02:16:22.061 --> 02:16:24.383]  I've been going there to the Middle East a lot since 9-11.
[02:16:24.824 --> 02:16:26.505]  And he's, you know, he got much more open.
[02:16:26.525 --> 02:16:33.391]  You could, you know, you could bank there, you could have the, you can go to an ATM machine.
[02:16:33.992 --> 02:16:36.674]  There were 30 different foreign broadcasts on TV.
[02:16:36.995 --> 02:16:38.056]  It was, he was opening.
[02:16:38.536 --> 02:16:40.918]  Yes, when you cross him, he's going to fight you to the end.
[02:16:40.938 --> 02:16:41.999]  It's a war to the end.
[02:16:42.379 --> 02:16:46.442]  He's fighting ISIS, he's fighting Al-Qaeda, he's fighting Al-Nusra.
[02:16:46.782 --> 02:16:48.484]  These are people that hang in garages.
[02:16:48.504 --> 02:16:49.945]  Some of the horrible stuff that happens.
[02:16:50.285 --> 02:16:54.629]  He's had as many as 200 of his soldiers executed at one sitting by these people.
[02:16:54.649 --> 02:16:57.791]  So, it's a war in which he's killed a lot and they've killed a lot.
[02:16:58.371 --> 02:16:59.632]  And it's a war to the end.
[02:17:00.673 --> 02:17:05.537]  And what I wrote about, in part, was that our Joint Chiefs
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:07.461]  We're good to go.
[02:17:27.556 --> 02:17:36.575]  Some of the groups we advocate as moderate have already made it clear that if they ever took over the government, no Christians or Alawites as a minority sect.
[02:17:37.125 --> 02:17:43.711]  She asked that Bashar Assad and about 12% of the people living in Syria belong to.
[02:17:43.731 --> 02:17:46.614]  None of them could be allowed to live in the country.
[02:17:47.054 --> 02:17:51.238]  They were talking about genocidal, you know, genocidal cleaning.
[02:17:51.959 --> 02:17:53.940]  Cleansing, if you will, of a society.
[02:17:54.941 --> 02:17:55.962]  Those are the moderate groups.
[02:17:56.002 --> 02:17:57.103]  So there you are.
[02:17:57.944 --> 02:17:58.805]  So the option was
[02:17:59.443 --> 02:18:12.552]  The Joint Chiefs looking at the intelligence, looking at the fact that we had been supporting for years covertly, this is through the CIA, David Petraeus, I would argue that Hillary Clinton surely should have been aware of this, she was Secretary of State.
[02:18:12.953 --> 02:18:20.158]  We began, after Libya fell, we began to funnel stuff that in an earlier article I called the rat line.
[02:18:20.798 --> 02:18:29.443]  A lot of arms from Libya into Turkey, and from Turkey, the gentleman running Turkey, Erdogan, is a total, complete supporter of ISIS.
[02:18:29.764 --> 02:18:32.105]  I don't think there's any question of that, even though we deny that.
[02:18:32.465 --> 02:18:34.186]  Our intelligence soldiers.
[02:18:34.246 --> 02:18:38.189]  What I wrote about is the fact that two and a half years ago, the Joint Chiefs decided,
[02:18:39.099 --> 02:18:43.461]  They can't convince the White House and the State Department with intelligence.
[02:18:43.521 --> 02:18:55.125]  They're just going to begin to do what they can do to try and modify the American policy or make it less, you know, nobody wants to talk about directly challenging a president.
[02:18:55.165 --> 02:18:56.065]  That's not your job.
[02:18:56.465 --> 02:18:57.966]  But I will tell you at a certain level.
[02:18:58.559 --> 02:19:01.061]  At the Joint Chiefs, the level four-star generals.
[02:19:01.381 --> 02:19:04.543]  The oath of office is an oath to the Constitution, not to the President.
[02:19:04.763 --> 02:19:05.564]  That's right.
[02:19:05.784 --> 02:19:06.864]  And it's very traditional.
[02:19:06.884 --> 02:19:08.546]  You can go back to Douglas McCarthy.
[02:19:08.606 --> 02:19:10.147]  You can go back to World War II fighting.
[02:19:10.467 --> 02:19:12.728]  You can go back to terrible fighting in Vietnam.
[02:19:12.788 --> 02:19:25.777]  President Eisenhower, as the President, challenged the military-industrial complex as a system himself, the ultimate level, still a general, saying, I want to challenge the people that want to control our military for their own aims.
[02:19:26.374 --> 02:19:26.894]  There you go.
[02:19:26.914 --> 02:19:27.575]  There you go.
[02:19:28.015 --> 02:19:35.960]  And you can even argue that the hatred for McNamara by the time he was ready to get out of there in 67 because he refused to listen to the generals.
[02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:37.981]  We've always had generals in opposition.
[02:19:38.301 --> 02:19:39.102]  So this isn't new.
[02:19:39.142 --> 02:19:50.869]  What they did, though, instead of directly challenging the Joint Chiefs, as I wrote about, beginning in the summer of 2013 after a lot of intelligence showed that our path was wrong.
[02:19:51.209 --> 02:19:52.169]  We weren't going to win.
[02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:54.751]  If we got rid of Bashar, we were going to have
[02:19:55.371 --> 02:19:55.952]  Clearly worse.
[02:19:55.992 --> 02:19:58.095]  I mean, a whole new Afghanistan.
[02:20:08.720 --> 02:20:10.181]  You know, people always talk.
[02:20:10.682 --> 02:20:11.682]  I'm a big supporter.
[02:20:12.883 --> 02:20:13.624]  I was in the Army.
[02:20:13.644 --> 02:20:15.986]  There's nothing better than America.
[02:20:16.306 --> 02:20:17.627]  It's the greatest country to be in.
[02:20:17.947 --> 02:20:19.148]  But we do have a lot of freedom.
[02:20:19.528 --> 02:20:25.813]  And I will tell you that our special operation forces, the Delta Force, the SEALs, they're terrific.
[02:20:26.233 --> 02:20:28.575]  They're very good at what they do, but they're being misguided.
[02:20:28.595 --> 02:20:28.875]  Absolutely.
[02:20:28.915 --> 02:20:29.235]  Yes, sir.
[02:20:29.335 --> 02:20:30.256]  Well, Cy Hirst joins us.
[02:20:30.276 --> 02:20:36.699]  I want to go back to the bombshell you just dropped that's in your article, Military to Military, London Review of Books, and expand on this with you.
[02:20:52.606 --> 02:21:03.233]  Because what you write here, and the generals you talk to, and you've got the former head of Defense Intelligence, Flynn, and others going public on Al Jazeera saying, look, we were ordered to aid Al Qaeda, ISIS, all this.
[02:21:03.613 --> 02:21:09.738]  This is bombshell, and it verifies stuff you were writing about years ago that you were demonized over.
[02:21:10.839 --> 02:21:18.722]  This is unprecedented in my lifetime to see generals on TV saying we don't want to back Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra, ISIS.
[02:21:19.523 --> 02:21:21.304]  We don't know why we're being ordered to do this.
[02:21:21.644 --> 02:21:23.184]  We don't know what the mission is.
[02:21:23.445 --> 02:21:25.886]  I mean, if your mission is to kill Christians, then it works.
[02:21:25.946 --> 02:21:26.426]  If it's not,
[02:21:27.386 --> 02:21:28.247]  You know, what's the point?
[02:21:28.307 --> 02:21:30.289]  So you've got the high-level sources.
[02:21:30.309 --> 02:21:36.553]  I just don't think the public realizes how seismic this is and what it symbolizes under the surface.
[02:21:36.573 --> 02:21:44.099]  So can you speak to more of that, please, sir, and go over to you what this means in your 40-plus years of being inside this?
[02:21:44.779 --> 02:21:47.121]  Well, we're just fighting this war wrong.
[02:21:47.799 --> 02:21:48.620]  We're fighting it wrong.
[02:21:48.980 --> 02:22:06.992]  We are supplying a great deal of material to people that we claim to be moderate, and there's no question, the first thing that happens when a small group that maybe isn't as far out as ISIS or al-Nusra, but the first thing they do is they have no choice either to sell it to them or get it taken away.
[02:22:07.012 --> 02:22:08.693]  So whatever we're sending there,
[02:22:08.933 --> 02:22:26.670]  They get bullied by the most extreme, yes sir, but when I'm getting back with you, sir, and I know you hold your cards close to your vest, you just got into the Pentagon, the Army mainly, from my sources, you're confirming it, saying, we're not going to back Al-Qaeda, al-Nusra, ISIS, we're just going to give intel to the Russians and intel to Assad and stop that.
[02:22:26.730 --> 02:22:31.515]  That is just a huge American moment that makes me so proud of the armed services.
[02:22:31.555 --> 02:22:32.316]  That is great!
[02:22:33.106 --> 02:22:34.307]  Well, you know, it's interesting.
[02:22:34.707 --> 02:22:42.494]  What they did was, because they didn't want to go directly to Bashar Assad, because the President had ruled that, you know, that would have been a direct violation.
[02:22:42.814 --> 02:22:51.461]  But we did know that the Germans in particular, the German Intelligence Service and the German High Command, and get this, the Russians and the Israelis,
[02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:55.371]  All three had been in contact with Bashar Assad.
[02:22:55.731 --> 02:23:00.172]  Because all three, even Israel, which sometimes, you know, doesn't always speak what the real policy is.
[02:23:00.652 --> 02:23:03.093]  They've got a lot of problems, government problems, leadership problems.
[02:23:03.413 --> 02:23:14.096]  But the guys running the military and intelligence system in Israel had the same point of view as our, the guys running our, at least that were running our Joint Chiefs, because the general at the time was General Dempsey.
[02:23:14.116 --> 02:23:16.176]  They're saying... Martin Dempsey, who's now retired.
[02:23:16.417 --> 02:23:17.977]  He's the new chairman.
[02:23:18.417 --> 02:23:21.479]  And we don't know where he stands on this because publicly he's said little.
[02:23:21.779 --> 02:23:23.140]  He's only a couple months into it.
[02:23:23.800 --> 02:23:25.681]  I understand a very competent Marine named Dunford.
[02:23:25.741 --> 02:23:26.682]  I just don't know much about him.
[02:23:27.142 --> 02:23:33.166]  I know more about Dempsey and... Was Dempsey the big hero in this going to Obama saying...
[02:23:34.106 --> 02:23:35.828]  You know, he wouldn't look at it that way.
[02:23:35.848 --> 02:23:40.071]  He just did something... The issue was, we were going the wrong way.
[02:23:40.091 --> 02:23:45.615]  The Germans and the Russians and the Israelis were begging for intelligence.
[02:23:46.075 --> 02:23:49.658]  One thing America does, and we do it very well, we have terrific intelligence.
[02:23:49.678 --> 02:23:53.661]  We have satellites, we have SIGINT intelligence, we do have people on the ground.
[02:23:54.001 --> 02:23:58.805]  Believe me, we can do better than anybody wants to write about with certain groups.
[02:23:58.865 --> 02:23:59.826]  We can penetrate people.
[02:24:00.226 --> 02:24:04.428]  We're not incompetent, but often it's the leadership that gets you in trouble.
[02:24:04.448 --> 02:24:09.170]  So they decided that, the Germans in particular, were kept on saying, what can you do to help us?
[02:24:09.370 --> 02:24:19.995]  They began in the fall of 2013, we began to shovel stuff that we had about Al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda, ISIS.
[02:24:20.175 --> 02:24:25.998]  We began to shovel information, not only about where they were, but what they were thinking, as much as we learned.
[02:24:26.398 --> 02:24:27.339]  And so we enabled
[02:24:28.119 --> 02:24:28.699]  I don't agree.
[02:24:46.838 --> 02:24:52.461]  As somebody in the article I wrote said, you know, we're doing stuff military to military.
[02:24:52.881 --> 02:24:56.683]  The President may not have known, but there's a lot of stuff he doesn't know about.
[02:24:56.723 --> 02:24:58.384]  So that's the way they got around the issue.
[02:24:58.884 --> 02:25:00.685]  And they began to help it and help Bashar.
[02:25:00.925 --> 02:25:07.129]  Not only that, it was very much a morale builder for the Syrian Army to know that they were getting very high-level intelligence.
[02:25:07.889 --> 02:25:11.191]  So, I don't know how history is going to judge this.
[02:25:13.267 --> 02:25:18.271]  As you can gather, stories like this in the mainstream press don't get copied.
[02:25:19.092 --> 02:25:20.973]  But it doesn't matter because there's the Internet.
[02:25:21.573 --> 02:25:29.439]  You know, there's guys like you and all sorts of other people around the world that pay more attention than often.
[02:25:29.459 --> 02:25:35.124]  The major papers here... You know, I worked for the New York Times for eight or nine years during Watergate.
[02:25:35.204 --> 02:25:37.746]  I won a lot of prizes in Vietnam and
[02:25:39.701 --> 02:25:42.283]  Certainly, the Nixon years, a lot.
[02:25:42.724 --> 02:25:50.730]  And one of the things, you know, is there's not many reporters at a good newspaper who have the kind of, you know, there's nothing special.
[02:25:50.770 --> 02:25:54.893]  I have friends that I know, most of the good guys at the major papers have somebody.
[02:25:55.473 --> 02:26:04.820]  And when you're at that level, where you're, you know, you've got access and you're covering the Pentagon or the State Department or the White House, the last thing you want to do, I know this makes, sounds almost
[02:26:05.410 --> 02:26:06.131]  We're good.
[02:26:14.853 --> 02:26:17.796]  The only thing the editor can do is ask one of the good reporters to do it.
[02:26:18.136 --> 02:26:22.060]  And what they want to do is figure out some way to get this out, you know, turf this, get this off their desk.
[02:26:22.540 --> 02:26:23.761]  So it doesn't really get happened.
[02:26:23.921 --> 02:26:25.183]  It doesn't happen with the papers.
[02:26:25.603 --> 02:26:27.805]  And I understand it because I'm sure I did the same thing.
[02:26:28.325 --> 02:26:33.070]  We're all, you know, we all love what we do, and we're more interested in ourselves than anybody else.
[02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:35.272]  That's one of the things about my business that's sort of wacky.
[02:26:35.652 --> 02:26:36.693]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[02:26:36.793 --> 02:26:39.994]  You've had the courage and the fortitude to go through a lot.
[02:26:40.034 --> 02:26:42.856]  I know you don't talk about this, but I mean, I know the stuff I've gone through.
[02:26:42.876 --> 02:26:48.519]  I mean, I can imagine, and I've seen some of the news, you've gone through a lot of harassment, persecution, to tell the truth.
[02:26:49.179 --> 02:26:51.660]  And it's just to see the media today just being repeaters.
[02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:54.982]  They take a corporate press release, this pitchman, and just put it back out.
[02:26:55.762 --> 02:26:56.783]  It's very, very sad.
[02:26:56.883 --> 02:26:59.424]  I just hope that you'll join us to talk about your Cheney book.
[02:27:00.665 --> 02:27:01.145]  Very, very sad.
[02:27:01.165 --> 02:27:05.147]  Yeah, but that's, you know, the problem I have with that is, you know, here's Cheney, who's a very tough dude.
[02:27:05.771 --> 02:27:19.517]  Who decided one day after 9-11 that the rules don't apply, which is, you know, and the thing that always interests me so much about Cheney, and I'm not telegraphing that much, is how easy it was for him to do it.
[02:27:20.197 --> 02:27:21.337]  He could change all the rules.
[02:27:21.357 --> 02:27:21.997]  He's a sociopath.
[02:27:22.058 --> 02:27:22.938]  How easy it is.
[02:27:23.218 --> 02:27:29.761]  It's just, it turns out, our Constitution, you know, which we all dearly think is so wonderful, it's pretty flimsy.
[02:27:30.141 --> 02:27:31.961]  It can be beaten to death very easy.
[02:27:32.542 --> 02:27:33.202]  And that happened.
[02:27:33.843 --> 02:27:34.603]  And so here we are.
[02:27:35.023 --> 02:27:41.986]  We have a prison in Guantanamo that to the Arab world is a symbol of everything that's wrong with America.
[02:27:42.006 --> 02:27:42.786]  It's so dumb.
[02:27:43.166 --> 02:27:45.267]  It's a prison guys can go into and they disappear.
[02:27:45.287 --> 02:27:48.348]  There's a lot of bad guys there, but there's an awful lot of good guys too.
[02:27:48.648 --> 02:27:50.129]  Guys that have nothing to do with anything.
[02:27:50.169 --> 02:27:51.529]  We were paying $5 to $25.
[02:27:51.669 --> 02:27:53.010]  We lose the moral high ground.
[02:27:53.050 --> 02:27:54.170]  Sir, I've got to get you back up.
[02:27:54.210 --> 02:27:56.471]  At the time I have left, I've got to ask you separately.
[02:27:57.051 --> 02:28:02.777]  Dealing with all the things that are happening and the way terrorism is being used to take our freedoms, bringing all these refugees in.
[02:28:03.077 --> 02:28:04.479]  We know a lot of them are foreign fighters.
[02:28:04.519 --> 02:28:05.420]  They're going to attack.
[02:28:05.720 --> 02:28:08.603]  Then they say, oh, we'll just put up naked body scanners on the highway.
[02:28:08.963 --> 02:28:10.785]  I mean, isn't the war on terror a fraud?
[02:28:10.825 --> 02:28:15.350]  Because all the funding in 15 years and we're still seeing terror attacks.
[02:28:15.690 --> 02:28:20.195]  Shouldn't we just preserve the Bill of Rights and Constitution and not be intimidated by terror?
[02:28:21.428 --> 02:28:24.129]  Well, you know, I don't necessarily agree with everything you're saying.
[02:28:24.149 --> 02:28:26.870]  Let me make it clear, because I have a different view on immigration.
[02:28:26.890 --> 02:28:33.352]  I think you can do things, rational things, to separate the good from the bad, although I admit there's always a risk with everything.
[02:28:33.692 --> 02:28:37.553]  But certainly, I'll tell you, we've walked away from a lot of bases.
[02:28:37.874 --> 02:28:38.374]  And you're right.
[02:28:38.894 --> 02:28:42.095]  One of the basic things we use, it makes it easy for the government
[02:28:42.775 --> 02:28:48.039]  And look, I know people that are very serious inside the government about the security risk and are scared.
[02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:54.685]  But the bottom line is, it's being used to pass laws that violate the Bill of Rights.
[02:28:55.445 --> 02:28:56.146]  I agree.
[02:28:56.166 --> 02:28:58.428]  Let's not blame the migrants and the poor war-torn folks.
[02:28:58.488 --> 02:28:58.788]  I know.
[02:28:59.148 --> 02:29:03.051]  I'm just saying they're going to use this, the few bad guys that come in to take our freedoms.
[02:29:04.532 --> 02:29:05.673]  When is the Cheney book coming out?
[02:29:08.792 --> 02:29:10.473]  You know, hey, come on, I'm a journalist.
[02:29:10.493 --> 02:29:11.394]  We never make deadlines.
[02:29:11.414 --> 02:29:12.775]  I don't want to make any predictions.
[02:29:12.795 --> 02:29:13.676]  Well, Mr. Hirsch, we're out of time.
[02:29:13.736 --> 02:29:19.660]  I mean, I know you got to go, but I just want to... Let me say bye to you during the break, but I tell you, thank you so much for your courage, and you deserve it.
[02:29:19.900 --> 02:29:21.701]  You're an amazing person.
[02:29:21.721 --> 02:29:22.662]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:29:22.902 --> 02:29:25.925]  Well, thank you for having me, and have a happy New Year.
[02:29:25.965 --> 02:29:26.465]  You too, sir.
[02:29:26.485 --> 02:29:26.925]  Thank you.
[02:29:26.945 --> 02:29:29.547]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:30.488 --> 02:29:33.170]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:38.493 --> 02:29:42.915]  Republican legislators are threatening to remove Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's protection detail.
[02:29:43.255 --> 02:29:52.618]  The Democrat governor, former campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, and his attorney general are eager to enact new gun control laws without involvement from the legislature.
[02:29:52.998 --> 02:29:58.960]  So Attorney General Haring announced that he would no longer recognize concealed carry permits from 25 states.
[02:29:59.581 --> 02:30:00.461]  Just like that.
[02:30:01.181 --> 02:30:08.823]  One guy tells the most law-abiding, most vetted people, you can no longer protect yourself, protect your family.
[02:30:09.123 --> 02:30:14.025]  He implies these 25 other states don't have the same standards of background checks that Virginia does.
[02:30:14.605 --> 02:30:15.145]  Not true.
[02:30:15.745 --> 02:30:23.147]  So Republicans in the Virginia legislature are saying, if the governor is so afraid of guns, we're not going to surround him with armed state policemen.
[02:30:23.507 --> 02:30:25.628]  And the people in Virginia need to tell the governor,
[02:30:25.868 --> 02:30:32.452]  That if he won't allow them to protect themselves, they're not going to pay for him to be protected by an army of bodyguards.
[02:30:32.873 --> 02:30:34.994]  For more information, go to Infowars.com.
[02:30:35.274 --> 02:30:35.835]  I'm David Knight.
[02:30:37.116 --> 02:30:43.938]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered 6 months free at Christmas.
[02:30:44.018 --> 02:30:46.719]  We've always offered 5 months free.
[02:30:46.919 --> 02:30:52.500]  But since I announced 6 free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[02:30:52.820 --> 02:30:54.641]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[02:30:56.241 --> 02:30:59.223]  It's grown into Infowars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[02:30:59.543 --> 02:31:08.069]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:08.490 --> 02:31:19.217]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's, you also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously using your username.
[02:31:19.477 --> 02:31:26.903]  You can also sign up for a trial month and only pay $5.95, and then 20 of you and your friends and family can watch PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:27.063 --> 02:31:29.105]  Get 20 memberships at half price.
[02:31:29.125 --> 02:31:31.046]  Be the Paul Revere in your community.
[02:31:31.246 --> 02:31:34.789]  That's 6 months free when you sign up for a year at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:36.826 --> 02:31:40.048]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:40.348 --> 02:31:48.353]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:48.593 --> 02:31:53.617]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:31:54.017 --> 02:31:56.298]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:31:56.538 --> 02:31:58.320]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:32:06.730 --> 02:32:07.651]  BrainForce is here.
[02:32:07.831 --> 02:32:09.932]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:32:10.052 --> 02:32:14.796]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:32:15.036 --> 02:32:16.697]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[02:32:16.737 --> 02:32:18.198]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:32:18.338 --> 02:32:21.541]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:32:21.821 --> 02:32:23.622]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:32:23.802 --> 02:32:24.703]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:32:24.723 --> 02:32:25.703]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:32:25.904 --> 02:32:27.845]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:32:27.905 --> 02:32:33.489]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:32:46.687 --> 02:32:50.149]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:32:50.750 --> 02:32:52.531]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:32:54.452 --> 02:33:02.117]  In Mexico, it's known that the Army is the oldest institution and also probably the most corrupt.
[02:33:03.298 --> 02:33:09.101]  And the Marines are seen as the chivalrous group that have never really been caught in any major corruption.
[02:33:09.481 --> 02:33:10.342]  And they battle the Army.
[02:33:12.263 --> 02:33:13.284]  In the United States,
[02:33:16.573 --> 02:33:20.735]  The Army, at least at the current time, are the good guys.
[02:33:21.236 --> 02:33:22.436]  And the Navy isn't bad.
[02:33:23.097 --> 02:33:25.758]  Just the Navy's always been involved in dirtier tricks overall.
[02:33:26.479 --> 02:33:28.480]  The Navy serves the globalists right now.
[02:33:30.060 --> 02:33:31.601]  And that's an oversimplification.
[02:33:32.042 --> 02:33:33.743]  You notice Cy Hirsch comes out of the Army.
[02:33:35.043 --> 02:33:38.665]  And, I mean, I was told this over a decade ago, but I've seen it more and more.
[02:33:39.766 --> 02:33:41.227]  I'll keep this song going with Dave Mustaine.
[02:33:41.887 --> 02:33:42.627]  I can even play the whole song.
[02:33:42.647 --> 02:33:44.849]  He's given me authorization to play any of his music, the whole thing.
[02:33:44.889 --> 02:33:45.189]  Here we go.
[02:33:47.554 --> 02:33:48.514]  The Darkest Hour.
[02:33:49.255 --> 02:33:50.635]  Yeah, let's crank it up and listen to this song.
[02:33:52.416 --> 02:33:53.236]  But who founded the U.S.
[02:33:53.276 --> 02:33:53.376]  Army?
[02:33:55.257 --> 02:34:01.459]  And from him, right down to every other level, there's an electrical charge to the U.S.
[02:34:01.559 --> 02:34:01.780]  Army.
[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:03.480]  George Washington.
[02:34:05.481 --> 02:34:08.302]  My hour of need, no, you are not there.
[02:34:08.322 --> 02:34:11.964]  And no, I reached out to you.
[02:34:13.064 --> 02:34:15.105]  Oh, this is good.
[02:34:15.145 --> 02:34:15.525]  Crank it up.
[02:34:24.462 --> 02:34:31.884]  Imagine all those Christians getting slaughtered all over Africa and the Middle East by the jihadis of the bloodthirsty, demonic Saudi Arabian leadership.
[02:34:32.724 --> 02:34:41.847]  Yeah, our military is full of a bunch of killers.
[02:34:44.745 --> 02:34:49.346]  But I liken it to the great screenplay that was written by one of my favorite screenwriters.
[02:34:49.386 --> 02:34:51.067]  He's better as a screenwriter than a director.
[02:34:51.647 --> 02:34:52.287]  Oliver Stone.
[02:34:52.327 --> 02:34:55.008]  He wrote Conan the Barbarian, Scarface, you name it.
[02:35:02.429 --> 02:35:06.390]  And in there, Tony Montana's not perfect.
[02:35:06.410 --> 02:35:08.671]  He's a man's man when it comes down to killing two little girls.
[02:35:09.872 --> 02:35:12.714]  When they're driving behind the UN envoy, they're about to blow his car up.
[02:35:13.674 --> 02:35:15.595]  He looks at the guy and he goes, you think I'm a worm like you?
[02:35:15.615 --> 02:35:16.756]  You think I kill little kids?
[02:35:17.657 --> 02:35:18.697]  No, you die.
[02:35:18.717 --> 02:35:21.479]  He pumps a couple rounds into his head.
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:26.522]  And he ends up losing his life later because he did that, but not his soul.
[02:35:32.986 --> 02:35:34.387]  Now I know it was you!
[02:35:45.902 --> 02:35:46.642]  All these years.
[02:35:51.043 --> 02:35:56.245]  Now I know it was you.
[02:35:56.265 --> 02:35:59.406]  So continuing, we are at this historic crossroads right now.
[02:36:01.767 --> 02:36:03.267]  Darkest Hour, Dave Mustaine, Megadeth.
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:08.402]  Yeah, I was talking about all these patriots that are awake yesterday, all these Hollywood folks.
[02:36:08.422 --> 02:36:09.904]  There's Vince Vaughn's awake to the rule of order.
[02:36:09.924 --> 02:36:11.585]  The list goes on and on.
[02:36:11.605 --> 02:36:17.590]  Why do we all feel alone being against this when we really are, when it comes to the intelligentsia, the majority?
[02:36:18.091 --> 02:36:19.172]  And we have the best minds.
[02:36:19.572 --> 02:36:20.733]  We have the best men and women.
[02:36:21.113 --> 02:36:21.854]  We're not cowards.
[02:36:21.874 --> 02:36:22.915]  We don't want to screw people over.
[02:36:23.255 --> 02:36:23.976]  We're the good guys.
[02:36:24.777 --> 02:36:26.358]  So stop worrying about what happens to you.
[02:36:27.038 --> 02:36:28.240]  And get involved in the fight today.
[02:36:28.260 --> 02:36:30.922]  It is the animating contest.
[02:36:32.283 --> 02:36:33.124]  They live, we sleep.
[02:36:34.673 --> 02:36:35.113]  Not really.
[02:36:35.993 --> 02:36:48.977]  Once we start living, the globalist lie starts falling, starts dying, and tyranny and its different manifestations vanish like phantoms at dawn.
[02:36:50.397 --> 02:36:51.998]  To paraphrase Thomas Jefferson yet again.
[02:36:54.918 --> 02:36:56.379]  There is so much to go over.
[02:36:56.919 --> 02:36:57.859]  Did you hear Cy Hirsch?
[02:36:59.039 --> 02:37:00.660]  He's not against migrants coming in.
[02:37:01.809 --> 02:37:05.211]  But they are bringing in terrorists that are going to attack, that'll be used to take our freedoms.
[02:37:05.391 --> 02:37:05.871]  We'll see.
[02:37:05.891 --> 02:37:10.054]  It'd be like if I ran the water system of a major city, or you ran it.
[02:37:10.814 --> 02:37:11.875]  You're not against H2O.
[02:37:13.716 --> 02:37:16.898]  But you want to take fluoride out because it's been admitted by Harvard and others to be toxic.
[02:37:17.458 --> 02:37:18.919]  They're like, oh, why are you against water?
[02:37:19.019 --> 02:37:20.079]  No, I'm against fluoride.
[02:37:20.740 --> 02:37:22.241]  Or let's go one that's not debatable.
[02:37:23.842 --> 02:37:24.342]  Cyanide.
[02:37:26.553 --> 02:37:34.076]  If they put 20 pounds of cyanide, say, in the hypothetically Detroit water supply, that's enough to kill the whole city.
[02:37:35.117 --> 02:37:38.458]  I'd say shut the water system off so the pipes don't flow.
[02:37:38.478 --> 02:37:40.019]  Don't tell people don't drink out of the water.
[02:37:40.459 --> 02:37:42.620]  Shut it off till you've been able to pump it out.
[02:37:45.521 --> 02:37:47.702]  Well, that's what we're saying about the open porters, people.
[02:37:47.902 --> 02:37:50.303]  It's a globalist plan to implode the country and bankrupt it.
[02:37:52.014 --> 02:37:55.316]  Shutting off the power plants, bringing in Obamacare, trying to raise taxes.
[02:37:55.716 --> 02:37:57.837]  That will blow the economy!
[02:37:59.878 --> 02:38:03.179]  And I always run into business guys, they go, Rich people like money!
[02:38:03.519 --> 02:38:05.120]  They want a good economy!
[02:38:05.380 --> 02:38:10.643]  Federal Reserve, I made 50 million dollars on restaurants and car dealerships, Alex!
[02:38:11.003 --> 02:38:17.826]  I like your show, but, you know, I go have dinner with senators and stuff, they don't want to hurt anything!
[02:38:18.947 --> 02:38:19.327]  Literally.
[02:38:20.165 --> 02:38:26.016]  And you're sitting there talking to them, and I go, well the real rich, the ultra elite, let me show you their own white papers.
[02:38:26.376 --> 02:38:32.287]  They want a controlled economy shut down so they can buy everything up and consolidate control.
[02:38:34.312 --> 02:38:37.534]  When they raise taxes on everybody else, they write the laws that exempt themselves.
[02:38:38.054 --> 02:38:38.794]  Well, that's true.
[02:38:38.874 --> 02:38:40.355]  I know a lot of you get that done.
[02:38:40.375 --> 02:38:42.656]  In fact, I even worked on some of that myself.
[02:38:42.856 --> 02:38:43.877]  Well, then you do know.
[02:38:44.337 --> 02:38:46.158]  Stop acting like there isn't a war.
[02:38:46.398 --> 02:38:48.159]  Stop acting like you're not under attack.
[02:38:48.399 --> 02:38:49.360]  Stop acting like it.
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:50.560]  Or go join the enemy!
[02:38:52.141 --> 02:38:58.905]  Just either join the enemy and fight me, or stop saying it isn't happening.
[02:39:00.385 --> 02:39:01.506]  I respect the enemy.
[02:39:02.921 --> 02:39:05.202]  I don't like them and I hate their guts, but I respect them.
[02:39:06.062 --> 02:39:12.423]  All you people out there that think you can sit on the sidelines for your whole life and deny any of this is going on, I have had it with you!
[02:39:12.443 --> 02:39:19.625]  And I put the call out just into cyberspace, hey, if you want to fight tyranny, now's the time to come on the show.
[02:39:21.165 --> 02:39:22.245]  Now's the time to be counted.
[02:39:22.345 --> 02:39:23.386]  Now's the time to be heard from.
[02:39:27.407 --> 02:39:28.687]  Talked to Cy Hirst during the break.
[02:39:30.086 --> 02:39:31.246]  I said, you gotta come back on.
[02:39:31.266 --> 02:39:32.147]  You don't want to get your info out.
[02:39:32.167 --> 02:39:35.287]  And he goes, he goes, no, I'm going to come back.
[02:39:35.487 --> 02:39:38.448]  My old lady wants me to get over here right now, but we're going, it's a day off.
[02:39:38.468 --> 02:39:39.268]  We're going out to do something.
[02:39:39.288 --> 02:39:46.070]  But he goes, I know you got a lot of juice with what you're doing.
[02:39:46.130 --> 02:39:47.110]  Have a great new year.
[02:39:48.470 --> 02:39:49.010]  Cy Hirsch.
[02:39:49.030 --> 02:39:51.271]  Hey, Nico, this wasn't secret.
[02:39:51.311 --> 02:39:53.091]  I was just saying, I'm not going to make the claim that I'd be backing up.
[02:39:53.392 --> 02:39:55.172]  Control room did not say that was pretty cool, huh?
[02:39:56.860 --> 02:39:57.980]  I can confirm he did say that.
[02:39:59.081 --> 02:40:01.301]  Maybe not in exactly that tone, but yeah, he did say that.
[02:40:01.321 --> 02:40:02.522]  Well, it has like a New York accent.
[02:40:02.542 --> 02:40:03.322]  I can't do it perfectly.
[02:40:03.562 --> 02:40:05.522]  Alright, more like, I know you got a lot of juice.
[02:40:05.582 --> 02:40:07.063]  I mean, he does kind of have a cool voice.
[02:40:07.283 --> 02:40:08.363]  Okay, well then you do the imitation.
[02:40:08.383 --> 02:40:09.123]  What's the voice sound like?
[02:40:10.584 --> 02:40:11.724]  I couldn't do better than you.
[02:40:11.744 --> 02:40:13.825]  It kind of sounds, exactly.
[02:40:13.885 --> 02:40:14.445]  I can't do it.
[02:40:14.545 --> 02:40:15.585]  Inside Hersh's voice.
[02:40:16.285 --> 02:40:17.706]  And it's not about Alex Jones.
[02:40:17.766 --> 02:40:18.546]  Woo, I'm big.
[02:40:18.566 --> 02:40:19.826]  Inside Hersh's on my show, you know.
[02:40:21.387 --> 02:40:22.487]  Confirming what we're saying.
[02:40:23.999 --> 02:40:25.621]  It's like Gallo's humor, folks.
[02:40:25.702 --> 02:40:28.245]  It's not fun to have a thousand newspapers attack you.
[02:40:29.046 --> 02:40:30.568]  And again, we've become the story.
[02:40:31.029 --> 02:40:32.591]  I never wanted to be Gonzo Journalism.
[02:40:33.933 --> 02:40:36.316]  But other people didn't stand up to this level.
[02:40:37.979 --> 02:40:39.341]  And I gotta give credit where credit's due.
[02:40:40.950 --> 02:40:48.295]  We would have grown fast, not this fast, but we were on that trajectory 13, 14 years ago when George Norrie, Coast to Coast AM, had me on.
[02:40:48.816 --> 02:40:50.937]  People would say, oh, well, that's a show that covers all this kooky stuff.
[02:40:50.957 --> 02:40:55.280]  Well, he took it in the direction where it was 90% goofy stuff to, you know, 30% goofy stuff.
[02:40:55.320 --> 02:40:56.201]  The guy's a great patriot.
[02:40:57.022 --> 02:40:58.603]  Veteran himself, really smart guy.
[02:40:59.544 --> 02:41:00.624]  And that helped the show a lot.
[02:41:00.824 --> 02:41:05.428]  And Matt Drudge, you know, helping link to our stories.
[02:41:07.506 --> 02:41:11.148]  I guess the judge has been looking at us for 10 years or more, but more intensely lately.
[02:41:12.209 --> 02:41:15.991]  And it's because he's on a journey getting more sophisticated and awake.
[02:41:16.191 --> 02:41:18.933]  I'm way more awake than I was 10 years ago.
[02:41:19.073 --> 02:41:28.358]  Trump, I mean, let me tell you, if Trump isn't sincere behind the scenes, then I've been fooled.
[02:41:30.279 --> 02:41:31.320]  And I don't get fooled a lot.
[02:41:32.361 --> 02:41:34.582]  I think Trump could be dangerous for the wrong advisors.
[02:41:34.662 --> 02:41:35.883]  I think Trump is a wild man.
[02:41:37.437 --> 02:41:41.479]  Trump is definitely his own person, and Trump does not like watching this country get messed up.
[02:41:41.819 --> 02:41:44.121]  He kind of thinks of it as, you know, part of himself.
[02:41:45.241 --> 02:41:46.122]  It's loyalty.
[02:41:46.682 --> 02:41:52.865]  And a lot of these sociopaths, people go, oh, you're loyal to the country, you're loyal to rules, you're just weak because you're loyal.
[02:41:53.165 --> 02:41:53.385]  No!
[02:41:53.845 --> 02:41:58.788]  Loyalty is an ingrained genetic trait to not live in squalor.
[02:42:00.289 --> 02:42:04.491]  You people think you're smart because you lie all the time, or you're smart because you're not loyal?
[02:42:05.632 --> 02:42:08.115]  You don't even get to experience what real life's all about.
[02:42:11.718 --> 02:42:13.480]  And that's why the globalists are destined to fail.
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:14.401]  They are disloyal.
[02:42:14.902 --> 02:42:22.009]  They're pretty loyal to their own top group, but I mean, you can't be disloyal to humanity long term and not get screwed over by it.
[02:42:22.529 --> 02:42:27.835]  And so I got stacks of news here, but I mean, so much of this is metaphysical.
[02:42:30.233 --> 02:42:32.655]  I mean, I can get John Harmon on the air right now.
[02:42:32.715 --> 02:42:34.076]  John, I don't know if you're going to remember this.
[02:42:34.096 --> 02:42:35.998]  You remembered it the last time I asked you about it five years ago.
[02:42:36.018 --> 02:42:37.860]  It was like ten years ago, nine years ago.
[02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:40.382]  The head of the Kissinger Group, Rothkopf's son.
[02:42:40.402 --> 02:42:41.603]  He's written the book, Superclass.
[02:42:43.484 --> 02:42:46.907]  I'm chilling into him, and during a break, and John's listening during the break.
[02:42:48.389 --> 02:42:50.550]  John's up in Minnesota, but we have double backup.
[02:42:50.570 --> 02:42:52.912]  I just thought I'd like to run the show.
[02:42:54.093 --> 02:42:56.716]  And he was running the show that day.
[02:42:59.144 --> 02:43:03.568]  And I come on and I go, do you think I'm Alex S. Jones, the Shorenstein Center, the New York Times family?
[02:43:03.588 --> 02:43:07.492]  Because why are you coming on and telling me how global government's good and world government's great and all this stuff?
[02:43:07.512 --> 02:43:09.834]  And he goes, no, I know you're Alex Jones of Infowars.
[02:43:10.234 --> 02:43:15.339]  I thought if I was nice to you, you might want to work with us and be part of this because you're part of the superclass and you could join us.
[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:23.227]  Of course, I've been given these speeches by Fortune 500 heads and, you know, people years ago, but he was doing it on a live line.
[02:43:26.144 --> 02:43:28.345]  And then he came back another break and he goes, listen, there's no point in this.
[02:43:28.365 --> 02:43:29.645]  I can see you're not going to blah, blah, blah.
[02:43:29.945 --> 02:43:34.727]  But I mean, they were ready, folks, to basically say, why don't you come on up to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City?
[02:43:34.967 --> 02:43:40.369]  And I could go in and, you know, I guess Richard Haass might come in and I could have lunch.
[02:43:40.429 --> 02:43:44.290]  And then, oh, you know, if I really kissed their butt for a few years, I could have dinner with Henry Kissinger.
[02:43:45.752 --> 02:43:46.932]  What does that do?
[02:43:47.312 --> 02:43:48.933]  I want to promote freedom.
[02:43:49.833 --> 02:43:57.315]  I don't want to be accepted by a dying dinosaur group that hijacked America and then thinks it made America.
[02:43:57.675 --> 02:43:59.375]  You didn't make America.
[02:44:01.115 --> 02:44:02.416]  You didn't build this country.
[02:44:03.236 --> 02:44:04.156]  You're not invincible.
[02:44:04.476 --> 02:44:05.837]  You don't control reality.
[02:44:06.057 --> 02:44:07.297]  You're not history's actors.
[02:44:07.577 --> 02:44:07.957]  Got it?
[02:44:09.417 --> 02:44:11.678]  What you're going to do is start nuclear war with the Russians.
[02:44:12.699 --> 02:44:15.901]  Why would you want to overthrow Assad when he was already westernizing?
[02:44:16.181 --> 02:44:19.443]  Why would you overthrow Gaddafi when he invested all his money with you and you set him up?
[02:44:21.585 --> 02:44:24.447]  Because you don't want anybody influenced in Africa you don't control.
[02:44:25.127 --> 02:44:28.610]  You want that place in squalor and falling apart so you can buy everything up cheap.
[02:44:30.431 --> 02:44:31.611]  I just don't like that attitude.
[02:44:31.832 --> 02:44:33.713]  It's a looting, evil attitude.
[02:44:35.950 --> 02:44:37.451]  And I'm not some bleeding heart liberal.
[02:44:37.491 --> 02:44:41.252]  If somebody pushes American interest around, someone wants to mess with us, I'm like Thomas Jefferson.
[02:44:41.552 --> 02:44:42.973]  Send in the Marines and kill everybody.
[02:44:46.314 --> 02:44:47.695]  But we don't start fights.
[02:44:48.575 --> 02:44:51.276]  And we don't pull false flags and claim somebody else started it.
[02:44:51.816 --> 02:44:54.337]  Bullying a bunch of Iraqis is not what I stand for.
[02:44:55.718 --> 02:44:58.259]  And the real warriors that defend this country are sick of it.
[02:44:58.279 --> 02:44:59.500]  They feel bad about what's happened.
[02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:00.260]  They know the truth now.
[02:45:01.564 --> 02:45:09.448]  And I know I'm communicating directly with the criminals in the government right now, like I'm a cop with a bullhorn outside, you know, the house you got hostages.
[02:45:09.468 --> 02:45:14.750]  You're holding America and the world hostage, and I'm out here in the patrol car behind the door going, you'll never get away with it.
[02:45:15.750 --> 02:45:17.611]  Everybody's starting to realize what you've done.
[02:45:18.251 --> 02:45:21.813]  The best thing you can do is just stop now before you and others get hurt.
[02:45:27.356 --> 02:45:28.336]  It's a total con game.
[02:45:30.219 --> 02:45:32.880]  These people shouldn't be in control.
[02:45:35.162 --> 02:45:37.503]  We can make mistakes 100 years ago, folks, 50 years ago.
[02:45:37.523 --> 02:45:38.764]  We can't do it with the weapons now.
[02:45:39.624 --> 02:45:40.825]  It just has to stop.
[02:45:42.606 --> 02:45:47.188]  And all these billionaires trying to get to Mars to think the Earth's going to get blown up, does that give you confidence?
[02:45:48.829 --> 02:45:53.152]  And they write all these white papers and articles about, yeah, we've decided to kill everybody, trying to warn you!
[02:45:54.667 --> 02:45:56.188]  Bill Joy and countless other papers.
[02:45:56.828 --> 02:46:03.571]  Yeah, I went to a conference of 200 top tech owners and the consensus was we're not going to just let everybody play video games and virtual reality.
[02:46:03.591 --> 02:46:06.813]  They're going to build a system and then kind of phase humans out.
[02:46:10.915 --> 02:46:12.235]  I think you might want to know about this.
[02:46:12.815 --> 02:46:15.637]  I mean, again, and then they can get writers.
[02:46:16.937 --> 02:46:28.280]  At the Texas Tribune, and the Austin American Statesman locally, and the Austin Chronicle, and nationally, every paper there is, to just write articles attacking me, when all I want is to not blow the planet up!
[02:46:29.080 --> 02:46:35.982]  And then all the other intellectual people, all the other intelligence operatives, the other brass, the other people, they're all saying the same thing!
[02:46:36.262 --> 02:46:37.963]  I mean, you people are crazy!
[02:46:38.063 --> 02:46:38.543]  You understand that?
[02:46:38.763 --> 02:46:39.543]  You're nuts!
[02:46:40.584 --> 02:46:41.204]  You're nuts!
[02:46:42.910 --> 02:46:47.631]  Samantha Powers and all these weird feminists who are all about women's power.
[02:46:47.651 --> 02:46:50.612]  So the media says, it's okay, they're launching wars, they're women.
[02:46:51.493 --> 02:46:52.453]  And then it's real freakish.
[02:46:52.473 --> 02:46:53.553]  They've never been in the military.
[02:46:53.613 --> 02:46:55.354]  It's just weird.
[02:46:55.414 --> 02:46:57.394]  It just stinks of failure.
[02:46:57.715 --> 02:46:58.915]  It stinks of falling.
[02:47:00.103 --> 02:47:01.264]  It stinks of disaster.
[02:47:01.744 --> 02:47:05.967]  I'm not against women, but there's articles where they're going to make the packs half the size of the Army and the Marines.
[02:47:06.227 --> 02:47:14.053]  They're going to let a woman fail her fireman test, fireperson test, in New York because she failed it six times.
[02:47:14.093 --> 02:47:17.275]  She can just not have to be able to climb or pick things up.
[02:47:17.395 --> 02:47:23.540]  Oh yeah, we need five foot tall firefighters that can't pick people up.
[02:47:26.442 --> 02:47:29.364]  I mean, are we going to ban women having babies because men can't have them?
[02:47:32.711 --> 02:47:33.412]  It's freakish!
[02:47:34.232 --> 02:47:34.953]  It's garbage!
[02:47:35.733 --> 02:47:41.377]  And the elite are conquering us by making us dumb and stupid and sabotaging everything while they're sabotaging themselves!
[02:47:43.679 --> 02:47:44.059]  The U.S.
[02:47:44.099 --> 02:47:45.840]  military doesn't want to be replaced with robots!
[02:47:46.721 --> 02:47:48.582]  They don't want to be treated like crap as soon as they get out!
[02:47:49.703 --> 02:47:50.263]  I'm sick of it!
[02:47:52.185 --> 02:47:57.448]  And you people can't deal with the fact, just like Dr. Pchenik said, that I'm nobody special, but I do have the spirit of 1776.
[02:47:57.488 --> 02:47:57.909]  I'm not afraid.
[02:48:00.529 --> 02:48:02.670]  I'm my most alive when I'm in my greatest danger.
[02:48:03.110 --> 02:48:05.470]  And it's spirit.
[02:48:08.591 --> 02:48:09.172]  And it spreads.
[02:48:09.292 --> 02:48:15.613]  And that's the only reason they haven't cut me down, because just the drops I've been putting out are causing them big problems.
[02:48:16.254 --> 02:48:17.634]  Just like that Texas backbeat.
[02:48:18.354 --> 02:48:24.256]  Can we come back to the next segment with the, I think it's Texas Radio, The Doors?
[02:48:26.510 --> 02:48:29.751]  And that's exactly what Pchenik said, who's overthrown probably eight different governments.
[02:48:30.271 --> 02:48:43.877]  He said, info wars, out of the South, out of the swamps, out of the guts, out of all the dead natives, and the dead whites, and the dead blacks, and the war, and the savagery, and the voodoo, and all the rest of it.
[02:48:45.077 --> 02:48:52.740]  The South, nothing like it, what it's gone through, nothing like it, what it's done, out of that, out of Americana, out of all of that comes oozing the resistance to being a slave.
[02:48:55.970 --> 02:48:57.111]  The Texas Big Beat.
[02:49:00.073 --> 02:49:04.717]  And we're just one part of it, but we are a model of what will smash the enemy.
[02:49:07.459 --> 02:49:15.045]  So they're sitting there looking at this big tank of resistance, and they want to cut it, they want to stab it, they want to burn it, they want to shoot at the moon, but they can't.
[02:49:16.626 --> 02:49:18.808]  They can take a sledgehammer to me anytime they want.
[02:49:20.710 --> 02:49:23.392]  But what comes out, it's like killing one of the aliens, an alien.
[02:49:24.906 --> 02:49:25.346]  What comes out?
[02:49:25.386 --> 02:49:26.347]  What's the blood made out of?
[02:49:27.208 --> 02:49:27.989]  What's the blood do?
[02:49:30.011 --> 02:49:31.132]  Sends them straight to hell.
[02:49:32.673 --> 02:49:40.500]  The tree of liberty is watered with the blood of patriots first, then the blood of tyrants.
[02:49:41.141 --> 02:49:42.342]  And I don't have a death wish.
[02:49:42.882 --> 02:49:43.383]  Far from it.
[02:49:43.423 --> 02:49:49.469]  I love life so much, I'm willing to lay it down for freedom, so that others got a chance to do incredible stuff.
[02:49:50.458 --> 02:49:54.921]  And I want them to do what it takes to lay down their lives when the time comes to build something really great.
[02:49:54.941 --> 02:49:58.423]  Because I stand on the shoulders of my ancestors just like you do.
[02:49:58.743 --> 02:50:03.006]  And I get those of you that don't resonate with that, that don't have that background, that don't have that spiritual connection.
[02:50:03.306 --> 02:50:04.927]  I get why you serve your master.
[02:50:05.187 --> 02:50:06.308]  It's all you've ever known.
[02:50:07.368 --> 02:50:10.370]  But I'm not calling for you, because you're not going to hear.
[02:50:11.391 --> 02:50:13.692]  I'm calling for those that want to build something greater.
[02:50:14.873 --> 02:50:16.714]  I'm calling for those that want to be strong.
[02:50:17.904 --> 02:50:20.005]  And who don't mind somebody else being successful.
[02:50:21.085 --> 02:50:23.426]  I'm calling for people that are fans of humanity.
[02:50:24.486 --> 02:50:25.926]  Stand up against the New World Order.
[02:50:27.127 --> 02:50:32.548]  And truly bring in the enlightenment that will take us to the next level in God's plan.
[02:50:33.489 --> 02:50:34.649]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:37.455 --> 02:50:44.181]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[02:50:44.542 --> 02:50:48.185]  It caught me totally by surprise and it involves FEMA.
[02:50:48.526 --> 02:50:51.508]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[02:50:51.929 --> 02:50:57.014]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[02:50:57.614 --> 02:51:01.635]  Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again.
[02:51:01.975 --> 02:51:07.577]  But be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is, they must know something we don't.
[02:51:08.137 --> 02:51:18.160]  Go to FEMA3.com to see the number one item you should be hoarding and why supplies of this critical item are so low or even completely sold out at many stores across America.
[02:51:18.860 --> 02:51:19.741]  Don't miss out.
[02:51:20.101 --> 02:51:24.807]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in recent days.
[02:51:25.287 --> 02:51:30.553]  Go to FEMA3.com and discover the number one most critical item in a crisis.

[02:52:36.570 --> 02:52:39.239]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[02:52:39.319 --> 02:52:42.811]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[02:52:44.013 --> 02:52:47.194]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[02:52:47.495 --> 02:52:52.597]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[02:52:52.937 --> 02:52:54.158]  How is this even possible?
[02:52:54.438 --> 02:53:01.741]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[02:53:01.961 --> 02:53:09.384]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[02:53:09.604 --> 02:53:12.806]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[02:53:13.106 --> 02:53:20.512]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[02:53:20.912 --> 02:53:23.614]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[02:53:24.075 --> 02:53:28.138]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[02:53:28.198 --> 02:53:28.879]  That's Greens75.com.

[02:53:46.638 --> 02:53:59.225]  I want to tell you about Texas Rainy over the Big B. Comes out of the Virginia swamps, cool and slow with plenty of precision.
[02:53:59.946 --> 02:54:02.527]  The backbeat narrow and hard to master.
[02:54:04.849 --> 02:54:10.372]  Some call it heavenly in its brilliance, others mean and root for the western dream.
[02:54:12.446 --> 02:54:21.070]  If you are receiving this transmission live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you are the resistance.
[02:54:22.151 --> 02:54:23.632]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:54:25.492 --> 02:54:32.376]  Before wind blows.
[02:54:33.937 --> 02:54:34.737]  One last breath.
[02:54:37.218 --> 02:54:38.759]  Another song written by Dave Mustaine.
[02:54:41.195 --> 02:54:42.696]  Lock up your wife and children now.
[02:54:44.456 --> 02:54:45.717]  It's time to wield the blade.
[02:54:46.657 --> 02:54:48.938]  Because now you've got some company!
[02:54:49.398 --> 02:54:49.839]  Yes!
[02:54:50.559 --> 02:54:51.799]  Of drawing nearer.
[02:54:52.740 --> 02:54:54.040]  Let us steed they ride.
[02:54:54.901 --> 02:54:56.161]  They come to take your life.
[02:54:58.362 --> 02:54:59.442]  Onto the dead of night.
[02:55:02.424 --> 02:55:04.084]  See the four horsemen ride.
[02:55:04.985 --> 02:55:08.246]  So choose your fate and die!
[02:55:09.807 --> 02:55:10.607]  Oh yeah!
[02:55:13.789 --> 02:55:15.049]  Double meaning in this song.
[02:55:16.590 --> 02:55:18.551]  You've been dying since the day you were born.
[02:55:18.811 --> 02:55:20.091]  You know it's all been planned.
[02:55:26.074 --> 02:55:30.395]  A sinner once.
[02:55:32.116 --> 02:55:32.956]  A sinner twice.
[02:55:33.236 --> 02:55:36.238]  You need no confessions now.
[02:55:37.958 --> 02:55:39.419]  The horsemen are drawing nearer.
[02:55:41.175 --> 02:55:42.196]  Leather steeds they ride.
[02:55:43.897 --> 02:55:46.400]  And they come to take your life.
[02:55:47.861 --> 02:55:48.882]  On to the dead of night.
[02:55:50.884 --> 02:55:52.505]  You see the four horsemen ride.
[02:55:53.446 --> 02:55:54.607]  So choose your fate!
[02:55:59.791 --> 02:56:01.373]  Die again and serve the devil.
[02:56:01.473 --> 02:56:02.794]  Die again and serve Christ.
[02:56:02.854 --> 02:56:03.735]  But die you will!
[02:56:14.133 --> 02:56:15.814]  That is a great 7 minute song right there.
[02:56:15.834 --> 02:56:21.958]  It does when I was 12 years old riding a dirt bike with a Walkman on it.
[02:56:22.498 --> 02:56:24.119]  Alright, let's get serious.
[02:56:27.461 --> 02:56:28.922]  You have to choose which side you're on.
[02:56:28.942 --> 02:56:30.022]  I just keep going back to that.
[02:56:31.103 --> 02:56:32.584]  And that's the point that we've reached.
[02:56:34.625 --> 02:56:41.449]  And I knew exposing Benghazi and actually strategically not tooting my horn.
[02:56:42.352 --> 02:57:03.968]  With others about it that it would move into something over time that would really cripple the whole globalist operation we started coming out and now it's coming out and and so I will raise a toast to everybody on New Year's Eve I intend to do a Facebook mentions for everyone that stood up against tyranny that spread the word that sent links out that told their friends and family about what was happening because
[02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:13.306]  Whether it's them coming for our guns, or trying to get rid of our borders, or funding Al-Qaeda and others to commit atrocities against innocent Muslims and Christians.
[02:57:14.527 --> 02:57:16.548]  So many good things are happening right now.
[02:57:17.729 --> 02:57:22.132]  And I go back to the best of times, worst of times.
[02:57:22.232 --> 02:57:23.353]  At least we're in the fight now.
[02:57:25.455 --> 02:57:26.456]  And it is exciting.
[02:57:27.492 --> 02:57:39.801]  And so, there's all this other stuff happening, and they're coming for our freedoms, and it's undoubted, but they're hurried because they're behind schedule, and they meant to have a financial collapse set up to consolidate power, bring in a cashless society.
[02:57:40.061 --> 02:57:43.924]  The problem is their system isn't fully in place yet, but still it's melting down.
[02:57:43.944 --> 02:57:46.286]  Because they don't fully control it, they just kind of steer it.
[02:57:46.306 --> 02:57:47.827]  They're trying to herd cats.
[02:57:48.607 --> 02:57:51.750]  And their whole program is starting to unravel right now.
[02:57:53.011 --> 02:57:54.552]  And it's unraveling in a big way.
[02:57:55.888 --> 02:57:59.191]  But out of that chaos, they're gonna try to bring in their control.
[02:57:59.291 --> 02:58:00.712]  We have to use the chaos.
[02:58:01.153 --> 02:58:05.797]  A lot of people are paying attention to point out that they fundamentally create chaos.
[02:58:05.857 --> 02:58:09.980]  It's just there isn't enough of it to pose as the controllers and the saviors.
[02:58:11.362 --> 02:58:14.004]  Because if you expose their paradigm, their whole system goes down.
[02:58:15.145 --> 02:58:16.786]  You're either totally awake or you're totally dumb.
[02:58:16.846 --> 02:58:18.188]  I mean, it really comes down to that.
[02:58:19.028 --> 02:58:19.709]  Stay with us.

[02:59:29.729 --> 02:59:32.345]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:49.978 --> 02:59:57.460]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:59:58.460 --> 03:00:02.361]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:02.801 --> 03:00:06.622]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:00:06.982 --> 03:00:08.502]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:09.703 --> 03:00:14.644]  Fighting will be close at hand.
[03:00:21.001 --> 03:00:22.462]  We've just been preparing a battle space.
[03:00:23.702 --> 03:00:46.414]  They teach you that you play a Sony video game or a Microsoft video game to find... Adventure.
[03:00:46.454 --> 03:00:47.335]  Manhood.
[03:00:51.303 --> 03:00:58.625]  They tell you, you watch a movie to find the fantastical.
[03:00:58.685 --> 03:01:12.267]  When the fantastic spectrum of life in the universe is all around you.
[03:01:12.407 --> 03:01:14.308]  And we will use it only in emergency.
[03:01:18.809 --> 03:01:19.609]  Song says it all.
[03:01:30.385 --> 03:01:34.267]  That's right, don't listen to the big church.
[03:01:34.307 --> 03:01:35.667]  Just don't listen to the government.
[03:01:36.308 --> 03:01:37.768]  Listen to the media.
[03:01:37.788 --> 03:01:38.589]  Pray to God.
[03:01:38.889 --> 03:01:41.490]  Spirit will direct you.
[03:01:44.171 --> 03:01:45.072]  Not the enemy.
[03:01:45.712 --> 03:01:48.513]  It's captured almost everything.
[03:01:48.573 --> 03:01:51.975]  But as it captures everything, it becomes manifest.
[03:01:52.975 --> 03:01:54.376]  It's true nature revealed.
[03:01:56.334 --> 03:01:57.334]  That's its great weakness.
[03:01:58.195 --> 03:02:01.616]  The moment it uncloaks to fire, we're waiting ready.
[03:02:02.837 --> 03:02:03.597]  Behind the door.
[03:02:04.297 --> 03:02:04.777]  Prepared.
[03:02:05.898 --> 03:02:06.258]  Aware.
[03:02:07.418 --> 03:02:14.721]  The enemy on its power-mad trip believes it has full control because it was crazed and hungry enough to get control.
[03:02:15.441 --> 03:02:19.603]  But it only got control of corrupt systems that belong to it.
[03:02:21.138 --> 03:02:23.899]  Christ said, should we pay taxes to Caesar?
[03:02:23.919 --> 03:02:25.779]  And he said, let me see whose face is upon the coin.
[03:02:26.179 --> 03:02:28.560]  Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's.
[03:02:28.880 --> 03:02:30.300]  This is Caesar's system.
[03:02:32.440 --> 03:02:36.041]  This is a GMO crop owned by Monsanto.
[03:02:36.081 --> 03:02:36.941]  This isn't life.
[03:02:37.681 --> 03:02:39.342]  Don't be part of this.
[03:02:40.182 --> 03:02:41.382]  This is theirs.
[03:02:42.002 --> 03:02:43.603]  This is their false reality.
[03:02:43.963 --> 03:02:45.983]  This is their little world.
[03:02:46.303 --> 03:02:49.884]  They want us to put our minds into tiny boxes.
[03:02:50.834 --> 03:02:55.078]  Leanne McAdoo, I know you got a big transmission coming up exposing the hypocrisy of establishment media.
[03:02:55.538 --> 03:02:59.702]  Bill versus Bill, one sexual predator is hunted while the other is protected at all costs.
[03:02:59.722 --> 03:03:00.443]  That's important.
[03:03:01.084 --> 03:03:08.350]  Politicians may have to wear donor logos in California, like I guess NASCAR drivers, that's something Ventura's called for.
[03:03:09.111 --> 03:03:09.892]  Alex predicted it.
[03:03:09.932 --> 03:03:14.915]  TSA moves closer to rejecting state driver's license for travel to national ID card.
[03:03:15.195 --> 03:03:16.936]  And some states violate DNA privacy.
[03:03:17.317 --> 03:03:21.579]  Leanne McAdoo, what else is coming up as we enter the final hours of 2015?
[03:03:21.679 --> 03:03:26.863]  Well, I just kind of really want to hit home on how they're obviously coming after you.
[03:03:26.883 --> 03:03:28.284]  Now they want to attack Drudge.
[03:03:28.784 --> 03:03:36.347]  All I hear when I'm reading that Daily Beast article is, why are they getting so much attention?
[03:03:36.407 --> 03:03:37.328]  Why are they winning?
[03:03:37.368 --> 03:03:38.348]  Why are they dominating?
[03:03:38.408 --> 03:03:40.849]  Why won't anyone pay attention to us over here?
[03:03:40.869 --> 03:03:43.791]  And that's really important.
[03:03:43.831 --> 03:03:45.611]  That's a big move there in our favor.
[03:03:45.631 --> 03:03:47.512]  We have to announce we're having devastating victories.
[03:03:47.572 --> 03:03:48.232]  It's not bragging.
[03:03:48.493 --> 03:03:51.734]  Those in the war need to know that the Republic's hitting the enemy hard.
[03:03:52.054 --> 03:03:53.034]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:03:53.154 --> 03:03:54.635]  And they cannot stand it.
[03:03:54.735 --> 03:03:59.077]  And so it's just really interesting to see them coming after Drudge like this.
[03:03:59.277 --> 03:04:09.701]  And to really try to put it out there, how could he be trying to boost Donald Trump when the entire media is so blatantly all in for Clinton?
[03:04:10.261 --> 03:04:14.843]  How dare him not get in line and do what he's told and support Hillary Clinton, who's actually had him sued?
[03:04:15.303 --> 03:04:15.784]  Exactly.
[03:04:15.804 --> 03:04:19.005]  How dare him not support a woman who openly said she wanted to shut him down?
[03:04:19.585 --> 03:04:28.312]  Right, yeah, you know, where's the war on women really when they're trying to cover up for a sexual predator on one hand, you know, Clinton's husband?
[03:04:28.532 --> 03:04:31.655]  Leanne McAdoo, straight ahead for the next hour.
[03:04:31.735 --> 03:04:32.736]  Spread the word, folks.
[03:04:32.776 --> 03:04:33.817]  Have you done that today?
[03:04:34.117 --> 03:04:35.238]  You are the key to the info war.
[03:04:35.258 --> 03:04:36.159]  We need your help.
[03:04:37.796 --> 03:04:42.600]  The Affluenza teen and his mother have been taken into custody, reports Reuters.
[03:04:43.040 --> 03:04:53.308]  A wealthy Texas teen, who had been a fugitive after breaking his probation sentence for killing four people while driving drunk, will be returned to the United States after being caught in Mexico.
[03:04:53.709 --> 03:05:00.314]  Ethan Couch, age 18, and his mother, Tanya, were taken into custody Monday evening in a resort in Mexico.
[03:05:00.754 --> 03:05:14.239]  Couch became known in the United States as the Affluenzatine during his trial in juvenile court over the 2013 deaths, when a psychologist said he was so wealthy and spoiled that he could not tell the difference between right and wrong.
[03:05:14.599 --> 03:05:20.942]  He has been serving 10 years probation for intoxication manslaughter, a sentence critics saw as far too light.
[03:05:21.282 --> 03:05:28.585]  Couch and his mother disappeared earlier this month, prompting officials in Tarrant County, Texas to issue a warrant for his apprehension.
[03:05:29.026 --> 03:05:32.961]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com

[03:08:36.733 --> 03:08:37.593]  Harder than ever.

[03:08:53.098 --> 03:08:54.438]  So this is why it's more important
[03:08:55.038 --> 03:08:56.159]  We're good to go.

[03:09:44.294 --> 03:09:44.795]  And of course,
[03:09:45.535 --> 03:09:53.605]  You know, one of the big things that you're going to find there over the decades are just a lot of reports on Hillary Clinton and her husband, Bill.
[03:09:53.625 --> 03:09:59.232]  A lot of things that the media, the establishment media, would really just wish would go away.
[03:09:59.793 --> 03:10:00.774]  And you could really see
[03:10:01.955 --> 03:10:12.297]  I would say the hubris of Hillary Clinton, just truly thinking that 20 years passage of time would have just wiped out the indecency of her husband.
[03:10:12.597 --> 03:10:20.599]  She really was betting on that as she put out that video saying, all sexual assault accusers, we should believe them.
[03:10:20.679 --> 03:10:21.879]  You deserve to be heard.
[03:10:22.279 --> 03:10:24.460]  And as soon as she said that, people were like, what?
[03:10:24.540 --> 03:10:25.400]  Are you kidding me?
[03:10:25.900 --> 03:10:28.821]  You famously tried to defame
[03:10:29.581 --> 03:10:32.304]  Multiple women who came after your husband.
[03:10:32.724 --> 03:10:35.908]  So that's one thing I really want to get into here in this segment.
[03:10:36.628 --> 03:10:43.255]  Because as I was looking at the Drudge Report today, one of the articles that caught my eye was one from the Daily Beast.
[03:10:43.776 --> 03:10:46.719]  Why is Matt Drudge boosting Donald Trump?
[03:10:47.359 --> 03:10:56.244]  And this writer is just basically lamenting the fact that Matt Drudge would dare go against the establishment media and support someone like the Donald.
[03:10:56.665 --> 03:10:59.907]  Why isn't he supporting Clinton like everyone else?
[03:11:00.427 --> 03:11:03.349]  Why is he posting all these articles?
[03:11:03.729 --> 03:11:10.573]  And of course they go on and saying, you know, if you thought Drudge wasn't important because he doesn't make headlines anymore, you were wrong.
[03:11:10.753 --> 03:11:13.655]  He has 700 million visitors a month.
[03:11:14.195 --> 03:11:42.888]  Matt Drudge is huge and he's still very relevant and so they go on and they try to sort of make fun of him because he aggregates news from all over the world, things that don't seemingly have a political slant but of course they do because that's what Drudge does and what he does so well is he pulls things in from all over the world to tie it all in together, to show you how this agenda is truly a global one and he exposes that.
[03:11:43.328 --> 03:11:49.772]  And that's why so many people rely on the Drudge Report to get their news because he goes from all over the place.
[03:11:49.812 --> 03:11:52.093]  He doesn't just pick and choose one angle.
[03:11:52.813 --> 03:11:56.855]  And he basically turns this slavish establishment media on its head.
[03:11:57.456 --> 03:12:03.819]  So with that in mind, with him, you know, how dare he boost Donald Trump?
[03:12:04.299 --> 03:12:12.344]  Let's look at how the mainstream media has tried to rally around Bill Clinton in light of Donald Trump going off on
[03:12:13.044 --> 03:12:15.226]  Bill Clinton's penchant for sexism.
[03:12:15.286 --> 03:12:17.767]  Of course, he's come out now and said, Hillary started it.
[03:12:17.947 --> 03:12:20.569]  You know, she was the one that said, I have the penchant for sexism.
[03:12:21.089 --> 03:12:24.692]  Just thinking that we're going to sweep under the rug all of her husband's indiscretions.
[03:12:25.132 --> 03:12:29.695]  So last week, CNN, and this is a woman on CNN.
[03:12:30.596 --> 03:12:31.777]  We'll go ahead and get that clip ready.
[03:12:31.817 --> 03:12:37.580]  But she actually posed this question there to another few women on the panel.
[03:12:37.861 --> 03:12:38.881]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[03:12:39.422 --> 03:12:40.542]  We set the record straight.
[03:12:41.622 --> 03:12:45.844]  Is Bill Clinton sexist, or does he simply like women?
[03:12:45.864 --> 03:12:50.747]  He had some many high-powered women in his cabinet.
[03:12:50.827 --> 03:13:00.552]  Everybody from Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who he appointed to the Supreme Court, but then he had Attorney General Janet Reno, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Donna Shalala.
[03:13:00.872 --> 03:13:02.813]  So, is he sexist?
[03:13:02.914 --> 03:13:03.754]  Is that a fair question?
[03:13:04.960 --> 03:13:05.701]  Oh, really?
[03:13:05.981 --> 03:13:10.624]  Is Bill Clinton sexist, or does he simply like women?
[03:13:11.245 --> 03:13:12.385]  Are you kidding me?
[03:13:12.505 --> 03:13:14.247]  What happened to the war on women?
[03:13:14.307 --> 03:13:18.069]  What happened to the rape culture that the left is always wanting to push out there?
[03:13:18.530 --> 03:13:21.792]  So, of course, they're going on to talk about how he has all these women in his cabinet.
[03:13:22.172 --> 03:13:24.714]  Well, obviously, these were, you know, older women.
[03:13:24.754 --> 03:13:28.717]  Janet Reno, come on, it's probably not someone he wanted to sexually harass.
[03:13:29.657 --> 03:13:39.803]  But you notice how she didn't point out any of the women who, you know, let's ask Eileen Wellstone or Juanita Broderick or Jennifer Flowers how they feel.
[03:13:40.783 --> 03:13:43.044]  Does Bill Clinton just simply like you?
[03:13:43.545 --> 03:13:49.608]  Now these are just some of the sexual stories and allegations besides Bill Clinton's affair with his former intern.
[03:13:50.048 --> 03:13:54.311]  So Eileen Wellstone, she claims that Clinton raped her in 1969.
[03:13:54.631 --> 03:13:56.632]  So I mean that's going decades back.
[03:13:56.812 --> 03:13:58.553]  Juanita Broderick, that was in 1978.
[03:13:58.653 --> 03:14:02.996]  Jennifer Flowers, she claims she was his mistress for 12 years.
[03:14:03.497 --> 03:14:06.539]  Kathleen Wiley, she was a former White House aide.
[03:14:07.039 --> 03:14:10.341]  She claimed Clinton sexually assaulted her in 1993.
[03:14:10.801 --> 03:14:14.704]  Paula Jones sued Clinton for sexual harassment in 94.
[03:14:15.124 --> 03:14:21.529]  That lawsuit was dropped because there was an $850,000 out of court settlement that was reached.
[03:14:21.929 --> 03:14:23.630]  So these are just a few.
[03:14:24.030 --> 03:14:26.212]  There are many more allegations from women.
[03:14:27.312 --> 03:14:32.873]  You know, but here we have CNN coming out saying, doesn't he just like women?
[03:14:32.953 --> 03:14:34.834]  I mean, is that really sexist of him?
[03:14:34.894 --> 03:14:35.874]  How can Trump say this?
[03:14:36.394 --> 03:14:45.796]  Then, of course, we have the DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, coming out saying, anyone that wants to come after Bill Clinton, attack him at your own peril.
[03:14:46.136 --> 03:14:48.497]  And she's just going on the defensive here saying,
[03:14:49.017 --> 03:14:51.579]  Polls show that he could be re-elected right now.
[03:14:51.760 --> 03:14:56.083]  He's one of the most revered politicians or men to this day.
[03:14:56.343 --> 03:15:01.228]  So she's basically saying it's okay to sexually assault women and still be revered in that party.
[03:15:01.628 --> 03:15:06.833]  Of course, we saw Don Lemon shut off someone's microphone who dared talk about Bill Clinton.
[03:15:07.693 --> 03:15:15.980]  And then this week, NBC News' Savannah Guthrie tried to frame Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky as an alleged
[03:15:16.841 --> 03:15:19.983]  A fair, alleged incident and Donald Trump schooled her on it.
[03:15:20.483 --> 03:15:22.444]  She was like, you mentioned Monica Lewinsky.
[03:15:22.504 --> 03:15:25.046]  Are you saying an alleged extramarital affair?
[03:15:25.066 --> 03:15:26.606]  Well, that of course he's now admitted.
[03:15:27.107 --> 03:15:28.207]  Is that fair game?
[03:15:28.568 --> 03:15:29.908]  And Trump, that's what I like about him.
[03:15:29.948 --> 03:15:30.369]  He's sharp.
[03:15:30.409 --> 03:15:32.150]  He doesn't let the media run away with that.
[03:15:32.190 --> 03:15:35.071]  He says, was that actually an alleged affair?
[03:15:35.752 --> 03:15:36.792]  You know, he's admitted it.
[03:15:36.812 --> 03:15:38.473]  And she said, well, yeah, you're right.
[03:15:38.513 --> 03:15:39.093]  He's admitted it.
[03:15:39.514 --> 03:15:41.475]  And he's like, you don't have to use the word alleged.
[03:15:42.255 --> 03:15:43.456]  And so that's I mean, that's just.
[03:15:44.739 --> 03:15:54.585]  Evidence of how the media is trying to paint this and paint people into a corner and get them to say this story sort of how they would like to spin it.
[03:15:55.385 --> 03:15:58.707]  And then of course we've got this article out of Breitbart.
[03:15:58.907 --> 03:16:00.088]  Bill versus Bill.
[03:16:00.568 --> 03:16:03.610]  One is hunted down, one is celebrated.
[03:16:04.230 --> 03:16:06.431]  And this is actually an article from last year.
[03:16:07.152 --> 03:16:09.153]  They thought it would be pertinent to go ahead and
[03:16:10.302 --> 03:16:10.502]  I don't
[03:16:29.520 --> 03:16:32.122]  They don't want to talk about Bill Clinton.
[03:16:32.902 --> 03:16:40.407]  And, you know, this just goes on to describe the women that I've mentioned earlier, Juanita Broderick, the charges of rape.
[03:16:41.168 --> 03:16:43.209]  But it's not just that.
[03:16:43.530 --> 03:16:47.672]  The more important issue is the fact that Hillary Clinton
[03:16:48.968 --> 03:16:49.768]  is charged.
[03:16:50.428 --> 03:16:56.210]  She stands accused, actually, of defaming, threatening and attempting to personally destroy these women.
[03:16:56.690 --> 03:16:58.170]  Bill's bimbos, right?
[03:16:58.250 --> 03:17:02.311]  That was the bimbo eruptions that famously came out of her camp.
[03:17:02.711 --> 03:17:08.753]  So this is a woman who's trying to portray her whole campaign as a defender of women's rights.
[03:17:09.453 --> 03:17:13.594]  And she famously was going after these women, attacking them.
[03:17:13.654 --> 03:17:21.697]  She tried to destroy Monica Lewinsky, who was like 21 years old at the time, painting her as a crazed liar and stalker.
[03:17:22.137 --> 03:17:26.098]  The DC media was all too happy to to go along with that portrayal.
[03:17:26.978 --> 03:17:31.800]  And that was, of course, before Monica Lewinsky was able to provide some DNA evidence.
[03:17:32.280 --> 03:17:33.980]  So they, you know, destroyed this woman.
[03:17:34.000 --> 03:17:35.821]  And of course, that was where Judge really
[03:17:36.701 --> 03:17:37.221]  We're good.
[03:18:01.106 --> 03:18:02.908]  This is the lady that settled out of court.
[03:18:03.088 --> 03:18:05.250]  They smeared her as trailer trash.
[03:18:06.150 --> 03:18:12.275]  One of Bill Clinton's operatives said, hey, well, if you drag a $100 bill through the trailer park, you never know what you're going to get.
[03:18:12.776 --> 03:18:15.038]  So, I mean, this is the way that they were attacking women.
[03:18:15.118 --> 03:18:18.120]  And that's the real war on women, right?
[03:18:18.220 --> 03:18:28.528]  And so it's just pretty interesting to see how they are rallying around Bill Clinton when they, you know, we saw this with Obama where they were trying to play the race card.
[03:18:29.329 --> 03:18:31.952]  We knew they were going to play the gender card with Clinton.
[03:18:32.552 --> 03:18:36.196]  And, I mean, this is why the establishment media is dying.
[03:18:36.296 --> 03:18:41.500]  Because their hypocrisy, their lies, all their blatant propaganda is just being thrown in their face.
[03:18:41.601 --> 03:18:48.227]  You can't lie to people anymore, especially not when you have the internet, which is of course why they want to shut it down.
[03:18:48.967 --> 03:18:56.554]  And even the Wall Street Journal is coming out today saying, if Hillary plays the sexism card, then Bill's behavior is fair game.
[03:18:57.075 --> 03:19:05.002]  And they're calling it the Clinton War on Women, and calling out how she and her allies are going to try to spin any criticism as sexist.
[03:19:05.583 --> 03:19:08.486]  So that, I think, is just key right there.
[03:19:08.506 --> 03:19:11.528]  No one's going to lay down and take this anymore.
[03:19:11.628 --> 03:19:14.031]  Everyone's just saying, look, it's fair game.
[03:19:14.511 --> 03:19:15.412]  You want to play dirty?
[03:19:15.512 --> 03:19:18.313]  Well, clearly Trump is going to play dirty, too.
[03:19:18.433 --> 03:19:19.794]  So, there you go.
[03:19:20.254 --> 03:19:22.156]  And, you know, I think that's pretty important.
[03:19:22.516 --> 03:19:28.659]  Well, coming up, we are going to talk about potential politicians wearing logos in California.
[03:19:28.799 --> 03:19:29.780]  Wouldn't that be great?
[03:19:29.840 --> 03:19:33.962]  Trump came out and admitted that he pays off politicians to do what he wants all the time.
[03:19:34.403 --> 03:19:36.164]  So, it'll be interesting to see if he wears a logo.
[03:19:37.714 --> 03:19:40.897]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?
[03:19:41.317 --> 03:19:43.139]  How would you like to never be cold again?

[03:20:37.091 --> 03:20:45.894]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[03:20:46.114 --> 03:20:52.396]  And it's all possible because in the hustle and bustle of daily life, we forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[03:20:52.616 --> 03:20:54.157]  The numbers are staggering.

[03:23:31.867 --> 03:23:35.308]  From all of us here at SupernaturalSilver.com.
[03:23:50.325 --> 03:23:52.506]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:23:52.666 --> 03:23:55.846]  I am Leanne McAdoo hosting the 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:23:55.907 --> 03:23:58.667]  Rob Dew will be joining me in studio here in the next segment.
[03:23:58.687 --> 03:24:05.449]  We're going to be talking about some states violating DNA privacy rights by taking infant blood draws.
[03:24:05.469 --> 03:24:07.329]  A lot of parents aren't even aware of this.
[03:24:07.349 --> 03:24:12.271]  So we'll be talking about that as well as some proposed changes there with the TSA.
[03:24:13.371 --> 03:24:24.141]  Now, coming out of California, we, you know, we talk about this, we joke about this all the time whenever we are covering the debates or when someone's getting up there running for president.
[03:24:24.642 --> 03:24:32.849]  They should be forced to wear logos just like NASCAR race car drivers, how they have to show everyone who has sponsored their team.
[03:24:33.690 --> 03:24:37.553]  And now that could be a reality in California.
[03:24:37.573 --> 03:24:48.042]  This is a group, California is not for sale, and they are trying to get a potential ballot measure submitted for the 2016 election.
[03:24:48.623 --> 03:24:52.867]  And the group is pretty certain that they're going to have some luck with this.
[03:24:52.907 --> 03:24:57.931]  So let's go ahead and play a little bit of this news clip out of ABC 10 News in San Diego.
[03:24:58.171 --> 03:25:03.977]  When we see race car drivers, there's no mistaking that sponsors make NASCAR's wheels go round.
[03:25:04.537 --> 03:25:06.779]  Imagine if our politicians had to do the same.
[03:25:06.959 --> 03:25:09.001]  If they don't take any money, they won't have to wear any stickers.
[03:25:09.322 --> 03:25:17.269]  Local entrepreneur John Cox wants California state assembly members and senators to display their top ten donors anytime they speak on the floor.
[03:25:18.010 --> 03:25:26.378]  Just like these life-size cutouts he's displayed in front of the county building and on the steps of the state capitol, they're covered in corporate and union logos.
[03:25:26.538 --> 03:25:28.400]  It's a corrupt system and it's got to change.
[03:25:35.011 --> 03:25:37.792]  I think many of them, most of them are probably good people.
[03:25:38.532 --> 03:25:42.694]  It's pretty interesting to see how many logos those guys have all over them.
[03:25:48.436 --> 03:25:50.358]  These people are not going to change it on their own.
[03:25:50.538 --> 03:25:56.622]  Senator Marty Block says he supports reasonable measures to provide more transparency to our legislative process.
[03:25:57.143 --> 03:26:02.647]  Assemblymember Rocky Chavez agrees, adding we should maintain some professionalism on the assembly floor, though.
[03:26:02.787 --> 03:26:10.793]  To have everybody decked out as race car drivers, I think, would be circus hour, which wouldn't really benefit the public.
[03:26:11.053 --> 03:26:16.135]  In January, Cox will start collecting the required 365,000 signatures statewide.
[03:26:16.175 --> 03:26:20.816]  I actually think that this idea will be so popular that we'll get 3 million signatures.
[03:26:21.076 --> 03:26:24.837]  If all goes his way, Californians will vote on this next November.
[03:26:25.298 --> 03:26:26.138]  Robert Santos, 10 News.
[03:26:27.276 --> 03:26:33.260]  So that was, I mean, just a really incredible idea whose time has come.
[03:26:33.680 --> 03:26:48.890]  And in response to Chavez's claim that this would be a circus element there on the legislature, Cox responded, you know it's a circus that politicians can openly take money from corporations and unions and have no accountability afterwards.
[03:26:49.330 --> 03:26:50.311]  It's a complete joke.
[03:26:50.711 --> 03:26:53.653]  If Mr. Chavez doesn't like this, I have a brilliant solution for him.
[03:26:53.993 --> 03:26:55.194]  Stop taking money
[03:27:15.845 --> 03:27:18.966]  They weren't just sticking logos on them willy-nilly.
[03:27:19.106 --> 03:27:20.587]  These were actual logos.
[03:27:20.707 --> 03:27:23.808]  I mean, these were actual people who were sponsoring these politicians.
[03:27:24.268 --> 03:27:30.450]  And so, you know, for instance, in California, you've got your mandatory vaccination bill being pushed there.
[03:27:30.910 --> 03:27:35.372]  And some of the senators that were behind this push to have
[03:27:36.457 --> 03:27:39.699]  Mandatory vaccines were getting money from Big Pharma.
[03:27:39.760 --> 03:27:48.326]  They were getting money from a lot of drug companies or they had stocks or investments within, you know, the MMRI or things, these vaccines.
[03:27:48.426 --> 03:28:03.937]  And so, you know, if you're going to force the population to have to take one of your products because that's what a vaccine is, well, then you should be forced to let people know who is behind you, who's behind the push for the gun grab and things like that.

[03:28:08.439 --> 03:28:17.723]  They say, to show how you can get involved with this measure, they need to get, I believe, 350,000 signatures in order to get this on the ballot for 2016.
[03:28:18.864 --> 03:28:21.705]  But how incredible would that be?
[03:28:21.805 --> 03:28:24.286]  I think we need to make this a nationwide movement.
[03:28:24.386 --> 03:28:30.668]  Hopefully we can get this passed in time for the next election in four years.
[03:28:31.169 --> 03:28:34.250]  So that is, California is not for sale.
[03:28:34.910 --> 03:28:53.544]  Now, one thing we've learned today, of course, we knew that the NSA has been spying on all the rest of America, but they're actually spying on Congress as well as some of their allies and foreign dignitaries and any conversations that they have with those foreign dignitaries and Congress.
[03:28:53.944 --> 03:28:55.665]  So what I think, Paul,
[03:28:56.926 --> 03:29:01.969]  Rand Paul has actually come out saying he's appalled by this and we need some more controls on our intelligence agencies.
[03:29:02.610 --> 03:29:03.590]  But what are they thinking?
[03:29:04.371 --> 03:29:06.272]  They're treating us all the same.
[03:29:06.592 --> 03:29:07.953]  We're all in this together.
[03:29:08.073 --> 03:29:10.975]  They're not exempt from the eye of Sauron.
[03:29:11.475 --> 03:29:13.817]  And I think they're starting to realize that.
[03:29:14.457 --> 03:29:21.441]  And we also have another story of spy agencies resisting the push to expand scrutiny of their top employees.
[03:29:21.681 --> 03:29:23.983]  So they don't want anyone spying on them.
[03:29:26.141 --> 03:29:29.149]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:30.092 --> 03:29:32.779]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:39.315 --> 03:29:43.737]  Republican legislators are threatening to remove Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's protection detail.
[03:29:44.057 --> 03:29:53.420]  The Democrat governor, former campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, and his attorney general are eager to enact new gun control laws without involvement from the legislature.
[03:29:53.800 --> 03:29:59.762]  So Attorney General Haring announced that he would no longer recognize concealed carry permits from 25 states.
[03:30:00.383 --> 03:30:01.263]  Just like that.
[03:30:02.003 --> 03:30:09.646]  One guy tells the most law-abiding, most vetted people, you can no longer protect yourself, protect your family.
[03:30:09.926 --> 03:30:14.828]  He implies these 25 other states don't have the same standards of background checks that Virginia does.
[03:30:15.428 --> 03:30:15.969]  Not true.
[03:30:16.549 --> 03:30:23.972]  So Republicans in the Virginia legislature are saying, if the governor is so afraid of guns, we're not going to surround him with armed state policemen.
[03:30:24.312 --> 03:30:26.433]  And the people in Virginia need to tell the governor,
[03:30:26.673 --> 03:30:33.268]  That if he won't allow them to protect themselves, they're not going to pay for him to be protected by an army of bodyguards.

[03:32:45.045 --> 03:32:47.009]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:32:47.951 --> 03:32:51.638]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:02.288 --> 03:33:04.411]  Alright, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:04.551 --> 03:33:08.216]  You are now entering the second half of the Overdrive Hour.
[03:33:08.277 --> 03:33:09.618]  I'm your host Leanne McAdoo.
[03:33:09.638 --> 03:33:17.089]  Joining me now is Rob Dew, obviously our nightly news director, in here with some pretty interesting news.
[03:33:17.349 --> 03:33:27.151]  First, I wanted to go ahead and complete the story I was getting to right before the break about the spy agencies resisting push for expanded scrutiny of their top employees.
[03:33:27.631 --> 03:33:28.851]  So what was happening?
[03:33:29.472 --> 03:33:29.992]  These U.S.
[03:33:30.032 --> 03:33:34.533]  intelligence agencies, they promised to be more open and accountable.
[03:33:35.153 --> 03:33:43.434]  And so there was a move by Congress that would require the CIA and other spy services to disclose more details about their high-ranking employees.
[03:33:43.935 --> 03:33:45.695]  But of course, this was met
[03:33:46.235 --> 03:33:51.118]  With a lot of opposition from the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper.
[03:33:51.698 --> 03:33:53.639]  And so the wording was watered down.
[03:33:54.280 --> 03:33:55.400]  And now check this out.
[03:33:55.981 --> 03:34:04.045]  Now the modified language will ensure that oversight committees know the names of senior intelligence community leaders.
[03:34:04.666 --> 03:34:15.412]  So that was their big win, is that now the oversight committees who are wanting to look and see these senior officers who are being promoted to even higher levels of office,
[03:34:16.152 --> 03:34:18.434]  Higher positions despite having all these problems.
[03:34:18.975 --> 03:34:22.738]  Abusive treatment, two botched operations, but they're still getting promoted.
[03:34:22.758 --> 03:34:27.902]  The oversight committees are now allowed to know their names.
[03:34:28.723 --> 03:34:30.805]  Don't look at us while we look at you.
[03:34:30.885 --> 03:34:35.489]  Yeah, that's how much control Congress has over the CIA and these other agencies.
[03:34:35.529 --> 03:34:36.710]  That was just shocking to me.
[03:34:36.770 --> 03:34:38.671]  It's just like, what a joke.
[03:34:39.172 --> 03:34:39.792]  What a joke.
[03:34:40.393 --> 03:34:41.834]  They really are ineffectual puppets.
[03:34:42.174 --> 03:34:42.415]  Yeah.
[03:34:43.223 --> 03:34:46.106]  So while we were coming in, people were listening to the bumper music.
[03:34:46.146 --> 03:34:52.093]  That was Lemmy from Motorhead playing Ace of Spades, singing Ace of Spades, and he died on Monday.
[03:34:52.113 --> 03:34:55.698]  And, I mean, the guy was pretty much a train wreck, if you look at his life.
[03:34:55.838 --> 03:34:57.640]  But he did exactly what he wanted to do.
[03:34:57.700 --> 03:35:00.543]  He drank that massive amounts of...
[03:35:01.304 --> 03:35:02.764]  Of bourbon every day.
[03:35:02.784 --> 03:35:05.805]  I think he switched to vodka towards the end of his life.
[03:35:06.665 --> 03:35:14.027]  You know, took a bunch of LSD, partied, lived the life of a rock and roll star, embodied the life of a rock star.
[03:35:14.528 --> 03:35:17.928]  And you know, I'm not, I don't want to come here and celebrate his life and what he did.
[03:35:18.129 --> 03:35:20.589]  But one thing I do want to say though, is he was an individual.
[03:35:20.909 --> 03:35:25.490]  And here was a guy who found out he had terminal cancer just two days before he died.
[03:35:25.911 --> 03:35:27.051]  So he was living his life
[03:35:27.611 --> 03:35:35.138]  The way he wanted to live it, not worried about, you know, his health and doing all these other things, and not being bogged down by all that, just living his life, putting out albums.
[03:35:35.538 --> 03:35:37.400]  Put out 23 albums on Motorhead.
[03:35:37.640 --> 03:35:38.561]  He started the band when he was 30.
[03:35:38.781 --> 03:35:39.482]  Right.
[03:35:39.502 --> 03:35:42.824]  He famously said, if you think you're too old for rock and roll, then you are.
[03:35:43.145 --> 03:35:43.685]  Exactly.
[03:35:44.386 --> 03:35:52.933]  And, you know, just the fact that, you know, we're coming up on a new year, 2016, and to not worry so much about what other people are doing.
[03:35:53.094 --> 03:35:54.355]  Do what you're going to do.
[03:35:55.114 --> 03:36:04.796]  You know, whether it's, I'm going to make the best website, I'm going to be a reporter, I'm going to be a video editor, I'm going to go shoot awesome stills of nature, and I'm going to make the best memes and put them on Twitter.
[03:36:05.116 --> 03:36:05.577]  Do that!
[03:36:05.797 --> 03:36:09.157]  Don't worry about what everybody else is doing, or if you're doing it as good as them.
[03:36:09.557 --> 03:36:13.498]  Lemmy wasn't the best bass player, wasn't the best singer, wasn't the best songwriter, but he did it.
[03:36:13.818 --> 03:36:19.460]  He just went and did it every day, and I think his last concert was in December 11th in Europe.
[03:36:20.240 --> 03:36:23.983]  So, less than a month later, he was dead of terminal cancer, but he was still living it up.
[03:36:24.023 --> 03:36:25.704]  So it wasn't keeping him down.
[03:36:25.724 --> 03:36:27.665]  He wasn't using that like, oh, I have cancer.
[03:36:28.125 --> 03:36:29.246]  You know, I was reading another story.
[03:36:29.266 --> 03:36:33.349]  There's some country star who's been living in a hospice for months trying to just keep going.
[03:36:33.789 --> 03:36:36.251]  And pretty much when you go to hospice, that's the last room you're going to see.
[03:36:36.451 --> 03:36:36.852]  That's right.
[03:36:36.972 --> 03:36:42.058]  But she's up and she's doing stuff, but she's also being affected by all these cancer treatments and everything else.
[03:36:42.618 --> 03:36:44.420]  And I mean, do you want, is it worth it?
[03:36:44.781 --> 03:36:51.168]  You know, when people go take these cancer treatments, is it worth, you know, the, those are your last moments, right?
[03:36:51.188 --> 03:36:53.130]  Do you want to live or do you want to just live a full life?
[03:36:53.491 --> 03:36:54.091]  Like what Lemmy did.
[03:36:54.132 --> 03:36:55.613]  He lived a full life up until he died.
[03:36:55.854 --> 03:36:56.094]  Yeah.
[03:36:56.374 --> 03:36:59.356]  So, that's really what I wanted to say about that.
[03:37:00.116 --> 03:37:02.678]  I was thinking about this and I'm like, ah, you know, here's an individual.
[03:37:02.858 --> 03:37:04.259]  We celebrate individualism here.
[03:37:04.539 --> 03:37:05.359]  This was an individual.
[03:37:05.599 --> 03:37:06.240]  He was weird.
[03:37:06.840 --> 03:37:15.345]  You know, that should be something, not necessarily the actions he was taking, but the spirit of being an individual and not looking to be in the system.
[03:37:15.365 --> 03:37:16.246]  Society's norms.
[03:37:16.266 --> 03:37:17.306]  Yeah, and fit in.
[03:37:17.346 --> 03:37:18.487]  You didn't care if he fit in.
[03:37:18.527 --> 03:37:19.388]  He just did his thing.
[03:37:20.328 --> 03:37:21.288]  Up until he died.
[03:37:21.428 --> 03:37:25.169]  So yeah, I want to commend him for that and you know his music.
[03:37:25.249 --> 03:37:25.810]  R.I.P.
[03:37:25.850 --> 03:37:26.150]  Lemme.
[03:37:26.310 --> 03:37:26.770]  There you go.
[03:37:27.630 --> 03:37:30.551]  And now on to the TSA.
[03:37:30.931 --> 03:37:37.373]  You know now they were gonna go traveling in a few days and we're gonna obviously, I'm gonna opt out.
[03:37:37.493 --> 03:37:38.073]  Yeah just to see.
[03:37:38.093 --> 03:37:39.954]  You know even though we're gonna give them a test case.
[03:37:39.974 --> 03:37:41.954]  See if they're gonna allow me to opt out.
[03:37:41.994 --> 03:37:42.814]  That should be interesting.
[03:37:43.815 --> 03:37:44.075]  But
[03:37:44.895 --> 03:37:55.049]  What they've also done, now they're going to say, there was this thing that came out, I think in 2005, they passed the Real ID Act on the recommendations of the 9-11 Commission.
[03:37:55.070 --> 03:38:00.357]  They said we need to do this, coordinate all the IDs of all the states together into a central database.
[03:38:01.198 --> 03:38:02.819]  You know, that could be hacked by anybody.
[03:38:02.839 --> 03:38:03.579]  To stop a terrorist.
[03:38:03.899 --> 03:38:04.579]  Right.
[03:38:04.799 --> 03:38:09.101]  But nobody's made this, this has not been laws, hasn't been put into practice yet.
[03:38:09.381 --> 03:38:14.683]  But now, there's the New York Times, TSA moves closer to rejecting some state driver's license for travel.
[03:38:14.763 --> 03:38:22.526]  So you may have to have your passport or another form of approved ID, because there's some states, Washington State, They don't have the chip.
[03:38:22.546 --> 03:38:25.667]  They don't have the chip in them, so they don't sync up.
[03:38:25.707 --> 03:38:29.429]  That's one of the things, is that they have to have some sort of, be able to be read by a machine.
[03:38:30.169 --> 03:38:32.971]  One of the other stipulations is that it has to sync into a database.
[03:38:33.251 --> 03:38:34.372]  Right, and what about fingerprints?
[03:38:34.392 --> 03:38:37.054]  Because here when I moved to Texas I was like, what?
[03:38:37.114 --> 03:38:38.595]  You were taking my fingerprints?
[03:38:38.615 --> 03:38:39.996]  Yeah, they do the thumb scan.
[03:38:40.096 --> 03:38:43.899]  In fact, we're about to go to a clip of a very young Alex Jones.
[03:38:45.589 --> 03:38:52.495]  17, 18, maybe even 19 years ago, going in and fighting this very thing that we're talking about now.
[03:38:53.076 --> 03:38:57.760]  You know, in 2015, he was doing it in like 98, Bill Clinton was still in office, it was 98 or 99.
[03:38:57.820 --> 03:38:58.060]  Wow.
[03:38:58.100 --> 03:39:00.142]  Conspiracy theorists.
[03:39:00.202 --> 03:39:01.443]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[03:39:01.623 --> 03:39:08.449]  They're talking about taking blood and taking urine samples, doing all these things that are now starting to happen and how this is going to be made.
[03:39:08.789 --> 03:39:13.093]  You're going to have to have one of these real IDs to get a job, to travel, well now it's going to be to travel.
[03:39:13.473 --> 03:39:18.354]  Well, they just sort of ease it in, just like, you know, to get into my gym, you have to use your thumbprint.
[03:39:18.434 --> 03:39:19.695]  So people just think it's normal.
[03:39:19.715 --> 03:39:20.395]  They think it's normal.
[03:39:20.835 --> 03:39:25.376]  And, you know, we just had the Office of Personnel Management had the millions of records stolen.
[03:39:25.496 --> 03:39:26.776]  That was a central database.
[03:39:27.176 --> 03:39:31.097]  So you create this DMV central database and it's just asking to be hacked.
[03:39:31.117 --> 03:39:34.938]  They're thinking it's going to cost $11 billion over five years.
[03:39:35.539 --> 03:39:37.139]  So that's where we're going.
[03:39:37.219 --> 03:39:40.840]  And if people don't believe me that they're taking blood to get people's license here out of D.C.
[03:39:41.740 --> 03:39:42.901]  HIV tests at DMV.
[03:39:43.122 --> 03:39:46.305]  Department of Motor Vehicles offers tests and results while drivers wait.
[03:39:46.445 --> 03:39:47.105]  Oh my gosh!
[03:39:47.165 --> 03:39:49.988]  What do you think they're doing with those samples when they're done with them?
[03:39:50.008 --> 03:39:50.228]  Oh yeah!
[03:39:50.248 --> 03:39:51.369]  Do you think they're giving them back?
[03:39:51.549 --> 03:39:52.670]  Oh my word!
[03:39:52.790 --> 03:39:53.651]  Here's another one.
[03:39:53.671 --> 03:39:56.454]  DC brings HIV testing to the crowd at DMV.
[03:39:56.654 --> 03:39:57.114]  This is back in 2010.
[03:39:57.254 --> 03:39:58.496]  This is five years ago.
[03:39:59.176 --> 03:40:16.591]  So they're doing this all over the place and I guess we had that video of Alex we've kind of cut it cut down a lot of the it was like a 20-minute clip of him going to the DMV it was on the news it you know it was a huge deal back when he did it but everybody thought he was crazy and now 2015 Alex Jones
[03:40:19.073 --> 03:40:20.455]  Proved right.
[03:40:20.955 --> 03:40:26.439]  If you don't have this, you will not be able to fly if you don't have a driver's license with the Real ID enabling in it.
[03:40:26.760 --> 03:40:30.262]  Some states are getting, you know, they have till June to change, but some states don't.
[03:40:30.503 --> 03:40:31.804]  Minnesota, I think, has to do it now.
[03:40:31.824 --> 03:40:32.224]  Right.
[03:40:32.524 --> 03:40:43.053]  And meanwhile, it's the TSA employees themselves who are caught money laundering or bringing guns, helping to move guns from state to state with their access and
[03:40:43.993 --> 03:40:50.176]  My favorite story is the poor guy who's getting searched and the TSA guy was beating his chest saying, I have power!
[03:40:50.616 --> 03:40:51.396]  I have power!
[03:40:51.756 --> 03:40:52.416]  I have power!
[03:40:52.457 --> 03:41:00.520]  And that is their only power to force you to stand in line and while they inspect your jar of grape jelly and make you late for your flight.
[03:41:00.880 --> 03:41:02.600]  Sir, can you bend over please?
[03:41:02.680 --> 03:41:03.321]  I could check you.
[03:41:03.341 --> 03:41:05.141]  You know what she wants to check.
[03:41:05.702 --> 03:41:07.502]  If you've seen the South Park episode.
[03:41:07.542 --> 03:41:07.843]  Yeah.
[03:41:08.163 --> 03:41:09.783]  So I guess we can roll that clip now.
[03:41:09.803 --> 03:41:10.083]  Yeah.
[03:41:10.123 --> 03:41:11.344]  And then I've got even more news.
[03:41:12.023 --> 03:41:15.244]  Well, getting a driver's license caused quite a stinker in Austin today.
[03:41:15.444 --> 03:41:19.345]  You know, in Texas, if you want one of these, well, you have to give your thumbprints.
[03:41:19.825 --> 03:41:26.187]  But KISJ Carter shows you why some folks today said they don't want anybody scanning their body parts.
[03:41:26.767 --> 03:41:33.529]  I'm gonna go up, and if they come up and touch me in any way, I'm gonna lay down peaceably and let the police state minions drag me away.
[03:41:33.889 --> 03:41:37.230]  Alex Jones wants to renew his driver's license.
[03:41:37.270 --> 03:41:39.311]  He also expects to be arrested.
[03:41:40.698 --> 03:41:46.981]  I'm going in there with my passport, my birth certificate, my driver's license, my W-2 form.
[03:41:47.101 --> 03:41:48.802]  But he won't give a thumbprint.
[03:41:49.062 --> 03:41:52.203]  Moments after this interview, troopers did arrest him.
[03:41:52.404 --> 03:41:55.205]  If you do not leave now, I will be forced to arrest you.
[03:41:55.225 --> 03:41:56.505]  Sir, I'm here to get a driver's license.
[03:41:56.605 --> 03:41:58.026]  I have never had a criminal record.
[03:41:58.066 --> 03:41:58.326]  Let's go.
[03:41:58.646 --> 03:42:01.708]  Jones says fingerprinting gives government too much control.
[03:42:02.308 --> 03:42:05.250]  And the next thing you know, they'll ask for urine and blood samples.
[03:42:32.968 --> 03:42:35.530]  This urine and blood testing, this is the slippery slope.
[03:42:35.570 --> 03:42:38.391]  And to those out there that say, what do I have to hide?
[03:42:39.291 --> 03:42:40.872]  I am innocent until proven guilty.
[03:42:40.992 --> 03:42:42.133]  I have no criminal record.
[03:42:42.213 --> 03:42:46.435]  Alex Jones has no criminal record and we should not be treated like criminals.
[03:42:46.755 --> 03:42:48.976]  Alright, they're ready for me, let's go.
[03:42:49.016 --> 03:42:50.277]  Come over and get the pretty little red light.
[03:42:51.141 --> 03:42:51.562]  Come on.
[03:42:51.642 --> 03:42:52.362]  Isn't that pretty?
[03:42:52.963 --> 03:42:56.847]  And they'll put a nice little clinic in here in the next few years for urine and blood testing, like Clinton wants.
[03:42:57.367 --> 03:42:58.148]  What do I have to hide?
[03:42:58.168 --> 03:42:58.668]  I'm a criminal.
[03:42:59.249 --> 03:42:59.729]  There we have it.
[03:43:00.150 --> 03:43:01.111]  Nice little pretty red lie.
[03:43:01.131 --> 03:43:03.593]  Get that, Mike.
[03:43:04.454 --> 03:43:05.054]  There we have it.
[03:43:05.335 --> 03:43:16.105]  Your photograph, they capture your signature, they capture your thumbprint, and now Clinton wants urine and blood, and I've given that to the media, the actual federal register that he wants the states to implement.
[03:43:16.385 --> 03:43:24.173]  And I guess it tells them how to put clinics in, and it tells them how to urine and blood test law-abiding citizens not under 18, like the media says.
[03:43:24.193 --> 03:43:24.233]  Hi.
[03:43:25.875 --> 03:43:26.355]  How you doing?
[03:43:26.415 --> 03:43:28.778]  I am here with eight forms of identification.
[03:43:29.639 --> 03:43:30.660]  I have my passport.
[03:43:30.700 --> 03:43:32.782]  Here is that, my name, and the form you asked me to fill out.
[03:43:33.382 --> 03:43:34.383]  I have no criminal record.
[03:43:34.424 --> 03:43:36.125]  My name is Alexander Emmerich Jones.
[03:43:36.566 --> 03:43:37.487]  Here is my passport.
[03:43:38.789 --> 03:43:40.190]  Here is my insurance.
[03:43:41.030 --> 03:43:42.491]  Here is another form of ID.
[03:43:43.111 --> 03:43:44.592]  Here is my old driver's license.
[03:43:45.052 --> 03:43:46.412]  Here is my birth certificate.
[03:43:46.792 --> 03:43:48.233]  And here is my W-2 form.
[03:43:49.053 --> 03:43:51.915]  And here is two more insurance cards, old ones, just so you can double check.
[03:43:51.955 --> 03:43:53.095]  This is a health club card.
[03:43:53.115 --> 03:43:54.196]  You've got plenty of ID.
[03:43:54.216 --> 03:43:54.656]  Good to go.
[03:43:54.676 --> 03:43:55.536]  We're going to get you to it right now.
[03:43:55.556 --> 03:43:57.577]  I just need for you to answer these first three questions.
[03:43:57.597 --> 03:43:59.478]  Take a look at these questions there and go over them.
[03:43:59.538 --> 03:44:00.558]  So I don't have to thumb scan?
[03:44:00.979 --> 03:44:01.859]  Well, we're going to get to that.
[03:44:02.119 --> 03:44:03.540]  You are eventually going to have to.
[03:44:03.560 --> 03:44:03.840]  Yes, sir.
[03:44:05.731 --> 03:44:08.814]  Not at this point, but you will before we're done with the process.
[03:44:09.235 --> 03:44:09.495]  Why?
[03:44:10.016 --> 03:44:10.997]  Because it's required.
[03:44:11.357 --> 03:44:12.839]  It's required by Bill Clinton in 1992.
[03:44:12.919 --> 03:44:15.762]  And it was instituted here in Texas in 1993.
[03:44:15.862 --> 03:44:16.723]  I know the code, sir.
[03:44:16.843 --> 03:44:19.385]  Are you going to institute his urine and blood testing when he commands you?
[03:44:19.405 --> 03:44:22.509]  Are you going to stick a needle in my arm when I have no criminal record?
[03:44:22.729 --> 03:44:27.134]  The only questions I'm going to answer right now are concerning driver's license issuance.
[03:44:27.961 --> 03:44:29.184]  You just follow orders, don't you?
[03:44:29.645 --> 03:44:37.505]  So you're saying you're going to deny me the constitutional right to travel if I do not submit to this digital thumb scanning?
[03:44:39.045 --> 03:44:44.170]  What I will tell you, today you will not receive a duplicate driver's license if you do not submit to a thumbprint.
[03:44:44.190 --> 03:44:46.312]  Okay, look, I feel like I'm being raped here.
[03:44:46.613 --> 03:44:49.656]  Well, I would sit down with you for hours and try to do what I could to help you.
[03:44:50.096 --> 03:44:52.739]  Then just give me my license without digitally thumb scanning.
[03:44:52.879 --> 03:44:54.881]  I am not going to violate DPS policy.
[03:44:54.961 --> 03:44:56.062]  Is there a religious exception?
[03:44:56.202 --> 03:44:57.664]  For your exception.
[03:44:57.704 --> 03:44:58.665]  Is there a religious exception?
[03:45:01.089 --> 03:45:02.310]  Everyone must take the mark.
[03:45:02.810 --> 03:45:04.651]  A digitally enhanced mark.
[03:45:06.052 --> 03:45:07.433]  A digital tattoo.
[03:45:07.773 --> 03:45:08.173]  I'm good to go.
[03:45:08.193 --> 03:45:09.034]  Why do you need my thumbprint?
[03:45:09.054 --> 03:45:10.495]  It's part of Bill Clinton's law, isn't it?
[03:45:10.535 --> 03:45:11.175]  It's an executive order.
[03:45:19.020 --> 03:45:22.062]  It's a decree by Bill Clinton.
[03:45:22.142 --> 03:45:22.402]  NCIC.
[03:45:22.542 --> 03:45:22.842]  NCIC.
[03:45:22.862 --> 03:45:24.743]  Drive without a license.
[03:45:24.763 --> 03:45:28.225]  Yeah, and if I drive without a license, what's the penalties for driving without a license?
[03:45:28.245 --> 03:45:29.506]  You know, I don't even want to go there.
[03:45:29.766 --> 03:45:30.227]  That's right.
[03:45:30.627 --> 03:45:31.047]  You know why?
[03:45:31.067 --> 03:45:31.647]  I'm asking you.
[03:45:31.667 --> 03:45:32.608]  It doesn't pertain to it.
[03:45:32.648 --> 03:45:33.969]  You're an officer, I'm asking you the law.
[03:45:34.549 --> 03:45:35.870]  I would be glad to sit down with you.
[03:45:35.890 --> 03:45:39.012]  So you're saying I'll be committing a crime by driving if I don't take your mark?
[03:45:40.352 --> 03:45:42.754]  This is against the grain of the Constitution.
[03:45:42.934 --> 03:45:43.094]  Look,
[03:45:43.783 --> 03:45:47.026]  If I don't take the mark, my right to travel is taken.
[03:45:47.387 --> 03:45:50.049]  You're taking my rights and telling me that it's no big deal?
[03:45:50.470 --> 03:45:51.751]  And now you want to hear in a blood test.
[03:45:51.791 --> 03:45:52.992]  Bring me the document.
[03:45:54.415 --> 03:45:56.016]  Who has the urine and blood testing document?
[03:45:56.077 --> 03:45:56.757]  I need it.
[03:45:56.777 --> 03:45:58.439]  I'm going to pass these out to people.
[03:45:59.499 --> 03:46:02.042]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Federal Register.
[03:46:02.122 --> 03:46:02.942]  Bill Clinton.
[03:46:03.183 --> 03:46:05.084]  Urine and blood testing plan for you.
[03:46:05.425 --> 03:46:06.485]  Tell your friends about it.
[03:46:06.826 --> 03:46:08.307]  We have got to stand against this.
[03:46:08.727 --> 03:46:10.889]  The states are preparing to implement this plan.
[03:46:10.909 --> 03:46:14.072]  If I leave now, I will be forced to arrest you.
[03:46:14.112 --> 03:46:15.473]  Sir, I am here to get a driver's license.
[03:46:15.553 --> 03:46:16.694]  I have never had a criminal record.
[03:46:16.754 --> 03:46:17.695]  It's time to go.
[03:46:17.735 --> 03:46:18.115]  Here I go.
[03:46:18.276 --> 03:46:18.936]  Get my stuff for me.
[03:46:22.858 --> 03:46:23.159]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:46:38.951 --> 03:46:41.814]  Often it's the patrol cars stopping terrorism, aren't they?
[03:46:41.834 --> 03:47:02.853]  I hope people were watching that on Infowars.com forward slash show because you know that was vintage vintage vintage vintage Alex Jones like at his best with the documents trying to change the system right up against you know the giant DMV which you know and those guys there they were right they were just following orders they didn't even know the law they didn't they probably didn't even know about the
[03:47:03.533 --> 03:47:05.315]  The blood and urine samples coming down the line.
[03:47:05.335 --> 03:47:05.695]  Of course not.
[03:47:05.735 --> 03:47:06.896]  Did you see how scared they looked?
[03:47:06.916 --> 03:47:08.618]  They were like, he is crazy.
[03:47:08.978 --> 03:47:09.639]  What's going on?
[03:47:09.679 --> 03:47:10.200]  We don't know.
[03:47:10.580 --> 03:47:10.820]  Yeah.
[03:47:10.900 --> 03:47:12.141]  We're just following orders, sir.
[03:47:12.202 --> 03:47:13.263]  We're just following orders.
[03:47:13.303 --> 03:47:17.547]  That trooper who arrested him, funny enough, we ran into him when we were opposing the TSA.
[03:47:17.927 --> 03:47:18.848]  Sort of the same thing.
[03:47:18.888 --> 03:47:20.850]  We were going to oppose the TSA.
[03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:21.230]  There it is.
[03:47:21.370 --> 03:47:24.774]  Alex reunited with trooper who arrested him for a thumb scan refusal.
[03:47:25.214 --> 03:47:26.015]  Guy's still working.
[03:47:26.035 --> 03:47:26.655]  He's like, you know what?
[03:47:26.896 --> 03:47:28.137]  A lot of things you said were right.
[03:47:28.557 --> 03:47:31.481]  It was really an amazing conversation.
[03:47:32.843 --> 03:47:43.758]  We were storming the Capitol to get them to uphold their ban on these naked body scanners and the TSA pat-downs.
[03:47:45.180 --> 03:47:51.745]  Which turned out they were like, oh they're completely harmless and then of course they had to get rid of those because they weren't in fact completely harmless.
[03:47:51.765 --> 03:47:52.065]  Right.
[03:47:52.105 --> 03:47:57.849]  So whenever I go to the TSA and I'm like, I'm opting out and they always try to say, oh it's not a microwave.
[03:47:57.909 --> 03:47:58.229]  Yeah.
[03:47:58.610 --> 03:47:59.550]  I'm like, you know what?
[03:47:59.791 --> 03:48:03.393]  You aren't a woman and I still would like to have children that aren't deformed.
[03:48:03.413 --> 03:48:04.874]  You unzip your DNA and say that.
[03:48:04.934 --> 03:48:05.475]  Exactly.
[03:48:06.295 --> 03:48:07.656]  So where does this all go?
[03:48:07.716 --> 03:48:10.777]  The feds are getting your blood and DNA in other ways.
[03:48:11.478 --> 03:48:24.764]  Anybody who has had kids at a hospital knows they come and prick the kid's heel and then they put these blood spots, they take these little spots and they put the blood on the heel on there and they send them off and they go, hey we're gonna do this to check for diseases.
[03:48:24.784 --> 03:48:25.304]  Right.
[03:48:25.684 --> 03:48:29.746]  And we're gonna check see if your kid's got any chromosomal deficiencies and we'll let you know.
[03:48:30.776 --> 03:48:35.579]  Well, I've had four children done this four times, never come back with anything.
[03:48:36.139 --> 03:48:37.300]  I haven't gotten one thing back.
[03:48:37.660 --> 03:48:38.361]  But you know what they do do?
[03:48:38.381 --> 03:48:40.262]  They keep this stuff and put it in a secret database.
[03:48:40.742 --> 03:48:42.503]  And they weren't telling people that that's what it was for.
[03:48:42.963 --> 03:48:44.344]  Here's the Texas Tribune.
[03:48:45.685 --> 03:48:49.167]  DSHS turned over hundreds of DNA samples to the feds.
[03:48:49.367 --> 03:48:49.747]  Wow.
[03:48:50.328 --> 03:49:00.054]  And it reveals a newborn screening program that transferred hundreds of infant blood spots to an armed forces lab to build a national and someday international mitochondrial DNA
[03:49:00.955 --> 03:49:01.677]  Uh, registry.
[03:49:02.039 --> 03:49:02.340]  Wow.
[03:49:03.243 --> 03:49:04.708]  Okay, and they do that with every kid that's born.
[03:49:05.319 --> 03:49:05.519]  Yeah.
[03:49:06.180 --> 03:49:08.502]  Every little baby that's born, they get your DNA.
[03:49:08.782 --> 03:49:12.965]  And now they've been sued, so now you fill out a card that says you want them destroyed.
[03:49:13.446 --> 03:49:13.606]  Right.
[03:49:14.106 --> 03:49:15.547]  Who knows if they really do it.
[03:49:15.687 --> 03:49:15.948]  Yeah.
[03:49:16.388 --> 03:49:17.589]  How is there any way to tell?
[03:49:17.769 --> 03:49:18.650]  And that's exactly it.
[03:49:18.690 --> 03:49:28.838]  They're wanting to create this database just like you have those other companies that tell people to send in their blood samples so we can tell you your history, your genealogical history.
[03:49:28.878 --> 03:49:29.599]  Where do you come from?
[03:49:29.659 --> 03:49:30.439]  It's so amazing.
[03:49:30.499 --> 03:49:32.361]  Maybe you were descended from a king or
[03:49:32.421 --> 03:49:36.085]  And when you sign something, you probably sign away your rights to have that.
[03:49:36.666 --> 03:49:39.028]  You consent to them owning it and being able to use it.
[03:49:39.369 --> 03:49:41.591]  Well, yeah.
[03:49:41.832 --> 03:49:44.054]  That's what came out, you know, just earlier this year.
[03:49:44.094 --> 03:49:50.441]  And of course, that 23andMe is Google's, one of the Google founders' wife owns that company.
[03:49:50.501 --> 03:49:51.002]  So it's just...
[03:49:52.023 --> 03:49:54.386]  You know, I wouldn't willingly give up my bloods.
[03:49:54.466 --> 03:49:58.650]  I mean, I'd be interested to trace my genealogy, but... I got a personal story.
[03:49:58.690 --> 03:50:03.455]  When I went to go get my license renewed this year, I wasn't able to do it, and I was like, well, what's wrong?
[03:50:04.036 --> 03:50:05.597]  Well, something from California back in 2009.
[03:50:07.879 --> 03:50:11.322]  Apparently, I got hit with a speeding camera back in 2009.
[03:50:11.542 --> 03:50:12.322]  Never knew about it.
[03:50:12.342 --> 03:50:14.203]  It's been sitting around in California.
[03:50:14.604 --> 03:50:15.084]  Who knows?
[03:50:15.104 --> 03:50:16.665]  I had to track them down.
[03:50:16.705 --> 03:50:20.127]  Try to get through the... I had to try to get through California DMV to get anything done.
[03:50:20.587 --> 03:50:21.588]  Crazy town!
[03:50:22.168 --> 03:50:23.729]  And, you know, everything's merging.
[03:50:23.809 --> 03:50:25.710]  Everything's merging, so everything talks to each other.
[03:50:25.730 --> 03:50:26.551]  Yeah.
[03:50:26.591 --> 03:50:27.511]  And everything can be hacked.
[03:50:27.591 --> 03:50:29.433]  As we've shown yesterday, we got hacked yesterday.
[03:50:29.453 --> 03:50:29.693]  Right.
[03:50:29.713 --> 03:50:31.214]  So, it's a crazy world we live in.
[03:50:31.254 --> 03:50:34.776]  We should all just go hide in our homes and put our little virtual reality headsets on.
[03:50:34.796 --> 03:50:36.197]  Or play rock and roll till we're 70.
[03:50:36.397 --> 03:50:36.577]  Right.
[03:50:38.101 --> 03:50:39.983]  My name is Don Whiskin.
[03:50:40.063 --> 03:50:44.328]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:50:45.028 --> 03:50:48.832]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:50:49.052 --> 03:50:50.174]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:50:50.614 --> 03:50:54.038]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:50:54.058 --> 03:50:59.003]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:50:59.283 --> 03:51:00.124]  He waited too long.
[03:51:00.524 --> 03:51:03.547]  In June, that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:03.887 --> 03:51:04.548]  What did I do?
[03:51:04.788 --> 03:51:12.035]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call XtendoVite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.
[03:51:12.255 --> 03:51:20.443]  Based on German studies of natural medicine, XtendoVite is designed to clear blocked arteries, clean the toxins from your blood, and improve your immune system.
[03:51:20.683 --> 03:51:22.265]  To get your XtendoVite, call 1-877-877-8777.
[03:51:23.906 --> 03:51:25.407]  928-8822.
[03:51:25.467 --> 03:51:36.512]  That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website heartdrop.com.
[03:51:37.292 --> 03:51:41.854]  Every year millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions
[03:51:42.054 --> 03:51:46.096]  ...and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[03:51:46.316 --> 03:51:52.599]  And it's all possible because in the hustle and bustle of daily life, we forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[03:51:52.819 --> 03:51:54.359]  The numbers are staggering.
[03:51:54.500 --> 03:52:01.102]  In the past five years alone, 41 billion dollars of consumer gift cards went completely unspent.
[03:52:01.222 --> 03:52:04.484]  That's 41 billion taken directly from our back pockets.
[03:52:04.764 --> 03:52:05.805]  Don't let them win.
[03:52:06.125 --> 03:52:15.614]  Instead, use your gift cards to help support the InfoWar and get 15% off when you use the promo code GIFT15 at checkout at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:52:15.854 --> 03:52:18.796]  Many gift cards are universal and work just like credit cards.
[03:52:18.997 --> 03:52:25.042]  But don't worry, if yours doesn't, just to promote the concept of using the money on your gift cards,

[03:52:28.503 --> 03:52:29.803]  That's promo code GIFT15.
[03:52:30.644 --> 03:52:32.344]  Don't donate your money to the banksters.

[03:52:37.206 --> 03:52:38.266]  You pick up the receiver.
[03:52:38.466 --> 03:52:45.308]  With your heart racing and sweat dripping from your forehead, you finally muster the courage to dial the number to call into your favorite talk radio show.
[03:52:45.388 --> 03:52:48.589]  It rings once, twice, and then... Hello, it's GCN.
[03:52:48.709 --> 03:52:50.250]  What's your name and the state you're calling from?
[03:52:50.390 --> 03:52:52.532]  Surprised you got through, you squeak out.
[03:52:52.672 --> 03:52:54.313]  Jason from Minnesota, please hold.
[03:52:54.433 --> 03:53:01.639]  As you patiently wait for your turn, you begin to daydream about being a famous talk radio host and what it would be like to have your own show.
[03:53:01.739 --> 03:53:03.421]  Jason from Minnesota, you're up!
[03:53:03.501 --> 03:53:07.324]  Millions of loyal listeners worldwide waiting to call and talk to you.
[03:53:07.344 --> 03:53:08.425]  What color are you there?
[03:53:08.545 --> 03:53:10.907]  Cheering crowds surround you, calling out your name.
[03:53:17.655 --> 03:53:18.716]  You blew it.
[03:53:18.756 --> 03:53:19.056]  Huh?
[03:53:19.276 --> 03:53:20.777]  Wait, no!

[03:53:29.945 --> 03:53:30.926]  Don't agree with a host?
[03:53:31.127 --> 03:53:31.767]  Let them know.

[03:53:58.167 --> 03:54:00.228]  Alright, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:00.348 --> 03:54:01.769]  I am Leanne McAdoo.
[03:54:01.809 --> 03:54:03.630]  We are closing out year 2015.
[03:54:04.131 --> 03:54:14.176]  And of course, it is just right after Christmas, so if you got some gift cards, if they're Visa, MasterCard enabled, go to the InfoWars store.
[03:54:14.317 --> 03:54:17.839]  You can use your gift cards at our InfoWars store.
[03:54:17.899 --> 03:54:21.661]  You can get 15% off the entire selection there.
[03:54:21.981 --> 03:54:25.223]  You just use the promo code GIFT15 at checkout.
[03:54:25.643 --> 03:54:35.492]  You can use any gift card and you get 15% off of your entire purchase here using promo code GIFT15 and of course you are helping to support the InfoWar.
[03:54:35.893 --> 03:54:39.897]  I think that's pretty cool because I have gift cards laying around from two years ago.
[03:54:40.377 --> 03:54:44.681]  So I'm gonna go ahead and use those because it's time to stock back up on my super female.
[03:54:45.322 --> 03:54:47.664]  Now Jakari Jackson... You can give those gift cards to me, I'll take them.
[03:54:49.148 --> 03:54:52.189]  You need a little extra bonus cash?
[03:54:52.489 --> 03:54:53.449]  It never hurts.
[03:54:53.509 --> 03:54:55.690]  I don't let my gift cards go to waste.
[03:54:55.750 --> 03:54:56.430]  I will use them.
[03:54:56.510 --> 03:54:58.150]  I don't know why I haven't used mine.
[03:54:58.830 --> 03:55:01.051]  So what do we have coming up for the nightly news tonight?
[03:55:01.391 --> 03:55:03.932]  We're going to look at the year in review.
[03:55:04.832 --> 03:55:06.572]  We have a report from Wired Magazine.
[03:55:06.592 --> 03:55:07.533]  They have listed the top
[03:55:09.073 --> 03:55:13.976]  Most dangerous people of 2015, one of whom actually lives right here in the city of Austin.
[03:55:13.996 --> 03:55:17.718]  We're gonna try to get him on the show coming up early, excuse me, early in the new year.
[03:55:17.738 --> 03:55:20.780]  Also, we're gonna have epic rants.
[03:55:21.200 --> 03:55:24.121]  You guys know we've been doing this thing for the past couple years.
[03:55:24.282 --> 03:55:24.622]  I think
[03:55:25.629 --> 03:55:30.112]  We have over 160 rants to choose from from this year alone.
[03:55:30.152 --> 03:55:33.294]  Myself and Travis, our YouTube guy, collect these rants.
[03:55:33.314 --> 03:55:33.914]  We have over 160.
[03:55:34.394 --> 03:55:38.177]  So we'll have just a snippet of one today that Marcus is going to edit.
[03:55:38.237 --> 03:55:42.399]  Then I think Darren McBrayer is going to do the master edit a little bit later.
[03:55:42.799 --> 03:55:44.801]  And also we'll have a replay of Cy Hirsch.
[03:55:45.241 --> 03:55:51.785]  So for anybody who missed it on the radio show today, you can go on the InfoWars Nightly News tonight and see that or at least a section of it.
[03:55:52.096 --> 03:55:53.917]  Yeah, I think that was a really impressive interview.
[03:55:53.937 --> 03:55:58.040]  We've been trying to get him back on for quite some time, so it was exciting to get him on today.
[03:55:58.060 --> 03:55:59.361]  Do you have a favorite rant?
[03:55:59.682 --> 03:56:06.827]  I kind of like the one that's been making the rounds recently, where Jones is smacking his face for being so bad at covering stories.
[03:56:06.927 --> 03:56:09.529]  Yeah, I can't choose one from this.
[03:56:10.129 --> 03:56:11.991]  I collect them, so I'm just so inundated.
[03:56:12.011 --> 03:56:13.452]  I can't really pick one.
[03:56:13.812 --> 03:56:19.536]  My favorite Alex Jones rant of all time was the one he was sitting in the control room.
[03:56:19.556 --> 03:56:20.397]  It was an old one.
[03:56:20.717 --> 03:56:30.040]  He had his headphones on and he was talking about, you know, cops and all this stuff, all this crazy stuff and talking about cops going to the strip club and kids getting autistic shots and all this stuff.
[03:56:30.380 --> 03:56:31.541]  So that was probably my favorite one.
[03:56:31.561 --> 03:56:35.942]  I think it's called like Alex, you can probably find on YouTube, it's like Alex Jones Best Rant Ever or something.
[03:56:35.962 --> 03:56:41.144]  Yeah, for those of you that don't know, Jakari Jackson is the collator of the rants, so you
[03:56:42.164 --> 03:56:48.047]  Yeah, I mean, some days he gives me a whole bunch, some days he's a little more serious or we have a guest on or whatever.
[03:56:49.188 --> 03:56:50.048]  And that's not even all.
[03:56:50.128 --> 03:56:56.812]  I'm sure there's days I'm out of town or I'm out in the field and I miss him, but from the ones we have, we have close to 160 just from 2015.
[03:56:57.052 --> 03:57:00.213]  Like, I'm so bad, I'm so bad!
[03:57:01.034 --> 03:57:01.614]  Thanks for your call.
[03:57:03.419 --> 03:57:05.540]  Turn it off and on just like that.
[03:57:06.060 --> 03:57:06.620]  Gotta love it.
[03:57:06.900 --> 03:57:11.621]  Well, and I bet one of the most dangerous people on the internet is going to be Donald Trump.
[03:57:11.681 --> 03:57:13.122]  Yes, he is on the list.
[03:57:13.182 --> 03:57:15.862]  There's actually a new Chrome extension.
[03:57:16.963 --> 03:57:20.123]  Big showed me this earlier where you can get it on your Chrome browser.
[03:57:20.203 --> 03:57:22.164]  It's trumpfilter.com.
[03:57:22.184 --> 03:57:24.444]  You can delete Donald Trump from the internet.
[03:57:24.584 --> 03:57:27.885]  Oh my gosh, so now we have to have safe spaces on the internet.
[03:57:28.225 --> 03:57:30.506]  We should just wrap everyone up in some bubble wrap and
[03:57:30.666 --> 03:57:37.574]  And I'll just have you a little bubble, and you know, so you could have little bubble keyboards, you know, so you can be protected from all the thought crimes.
[03:57:38.374 --> 03:57:39.335]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:57:39.696 --> 03:57:40.637]  No thought crimes.
[03:57:40.657 --> 03:57:45.262]  They say, adjust your filter settings on the fly and make America great again.
[03:57:45.662 --> 03:57:45.943]  Right.
[03:57:46.603 --> 03:57:48.946]  By shutting down the internet and free speech.
[03:57:48.986 --> 03:57:51.609]  There's a lot worse things on the internet than Donald Trump.
[03:57:52.506 --> 03:57:55.230]  All right, well, you know, you're absolutely right about that.
[03:57:55.490 --> 03:57:57.013]  They need filters for all the rest of that.
[03:57:57.473 --> 03:57:59.136]  Well, Jakari Jackson, thank you so much.
[03:57:59.176 --> 03:58:01.599]  We'll see you on the Nightly News tonight, 7 p.m.
[03:58:01.679 --> 03:58:02.100]  Central.
[03:58:02.540 --> 03:58:08.529]  And thank you all for tuning in to the Alex Jones Radio Show and the Info Wars Nightly News.
