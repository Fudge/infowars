[00:00:15.273 --> 00:00:15.914]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.594 --> 00:00:17.615]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:19.456]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:20.917]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.698 --> 00:00:23.599]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.841]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:31.505]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.161]  It's September 30th, 2015.
[00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:41.502]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:43.123]  I'm your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:46.184]  We've got an absolutely packed show coming up today.
[00:00:47.065 --> 00:00:49.466]  Bottom of the hour, we've got the angry foreigner.
[00:00:49.506 --> 00:00:52.007]  This is a YouTube viral sensation.
[00:00:52.047 --> 00:00:53.648]  This is a Bosnian immigrant.
[00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:58.625]  Who lives in Sweden, which of course we bash on relentlessly.
[00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:03.729]  We bash on the Swedish government for their open border pro-immigration madness.
[00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:09.333]  But this is a guy who emigrated to Sweden and now he's speaking out against the insanity.
[00:01:10.074 --> 00:01:16.739]  He's speaking out against the migrant invasion into quote the most progressive country in the world.
[00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.885]  So we're going to illustrate what happens when liberalism runs rampant at the bottom of the hour with the angry foreigner.
[00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:37.237]  You've heard us talk before about Swedish politicians actually calling for welfare and jobs for ISIS recruits who go over to fight in Syria and return to Sweden.
[00:01:37.637 --> 00:01:43.420]  Then they expect Swedish taxpayers to pay for their housing, to pay for their welfare.
[00:01:44.398 --> 00:01:48.059]  And for them to get jobs that replace Swedish employees.
[00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.560]  So this is going to be a really fascinating discussion.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:01.303]  Again, trying to get a perspective on the migrant crisis from people who are living in Europe, who are living amongst it, as these millions of migrants pour in.
[00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:04.684]  Second hour, we're going to talk about Gamergate.
[00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:09.325]  Now this is quite a technical issue that most people don't grasp, they can't seem to understand it.
[00:02:09.945 --> 00:02:12.346]  But it represents a fundamental threat
[00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:25.898]  To free speech, to having our own independent thoughts and not being brainwashed by not just Hollywood and the news media, which is declining in influence, but video games themselves.
[00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:29.781]  This is the most powerful industry on the planet right now.
[00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:32.522]  This is the most lucrative industry on the planet.
[00:02:33.023 --> 00:02:41.848]  So we're going to discuss how video games are being used and seized control of by control freaks to brainwash young people.
[00:02:42.418 --> 00:02:53.683]  We're going to be talking to a researcher, Theodore Morgan Major, who is blowing the whistle on a plot to re-educate an entire generation via video games.
[00:02:54.123 --> 00:03:00.526]  And we're also going to be getting to your calls later in the show, so we'll get those lined up after the bottom of the hour.
[00:03:01.387 --> 00:03:04.989]  Top stories on Infowars.com, which we'll be covering in the next segment.
[00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:12.232]  CNN analyst says Trump carson to blame if gunman shoots Muslims in a mosque.
[00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:28.563]  This is a CNN analyst who got up on Don Lemon's show and basically said, because of the quote, anti-Muslim rhetoric being spewed by Donald Trump and Ben Carson, that's going to cause crazies, right-wing radicals to go out and shoot Muslims in mosques.
[00:03:28.903 --> 00:03:30.824]  We're going to break down that propaganda.
[00:03:31.464 --> 00:03:33.145]  We're going to point out the fact that the left
[00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:43.104]  Never blames hate preachers who influence jihadists to go and shoot up cartoon events like we saw in Paris, like we saw in Garland, Texas.
[00:03:43.565 --> 00:03:45.787]  They blame the cartoonists themselves.
[00:03:46.187 --> 00:03:54.435]  But it's okay to blame Donald Trump and Ben Carson for an event that hasn't even happened yet, so we're going to break down that propaganda.
[00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:55.096]  Also,
[00:03:55.968 --> 00:04:02.973]  Muslim man admits strangling his daughter for dishonor after she was caught stealing condoms.
[00:04:03.593 --> 00:04:04.974]  And this happened in Germany.
[00:04:05.474 --> 00:04:10.518]  Again, where this migrant invasion of predominantly Muslim men is taking place.
[00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:12.759]  Shocking story.
[00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:17.082]  And this is the very kind of culture that we're importing into Europe.
[00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:25.101]  We're also going to talk about how Obama gave 1,500 terrorists asylum in the US.
[00:04:25.341 --> 00:04:34.774]  This is a Judicial Wash expose which we covered on Infowars.com yesterday, where basically 50% of those rewarded residency
[00:04:35.518 --> 00:04:42.804]  We're linked, not only to this refugee crisis, but also to providing material support to terrorists.
[00:04:43.445 --> 00:04:46.768]  And these are the kind of people who Obama plans to import.
[00:04:47.588 --> 00:04:53.854]  We're talking about 100,000 people imported into the US within the next couple of years.
[00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:54.815]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:56.916]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:04:57.016 --> 00:04:58.217]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:04:58.658 --> 00:04:59.519]  InfoWars.com.
[00:04:59.859 --> 00:05:00.459]  Stay tuned.
[00:05:09.395 --> 00:05:16.398]  A Georgia high school went into lockdown the other day after a student showed up with a Confederate flag.
[00:05:16.838 --> 00:05:24.981]  The incident started when a 10th grade boy arrived at Rock Mart High School with the rebel flag attached to his backpack.
[00:05:25.321 --> 00:05:31.224]  He was then confronted by two black students who were upset by the flag and a fight broke out.
[00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:38.073]  The scuffle was quickly broken up by teachers and staff.
[00:05:38.474 --> 00:05:41.836]  All three students were searched and no weapons were found.
[00:05:42.136 --> 00:05:51.061]  But then rumors began to circulate that more students would be bringing Confederate flags to school and a campus lockdown was ordered.
[00:05:51.562 --> 00:05:56.945]  No word as to whether or not the black students are equally upset with President Barack Obama.
[00:05:57.145 --> 00:06:02.431]  Who also displayed the Confederate flag on his own campaign pin in 2012.
[00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:07.516]  And you can learn more at Infowars.com.

[00:08:35.097 --> 00:08:40.680]  We're back live.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.081]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:43.561]  I'm your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:45.682]  We've got a great guest coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:08:46.203 --> 00:08:47.904]  He's called the Angry Foreigner.
[00:08:48.404 --> 00:08:50.345]  He's a viral success on YouTube.
[00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:58.589]  And basically he's blowing the whistle on how this mass immigration, this open border policy, is impacting Sweden.
[00:08:59.145 --> 00:09:14.208]  As they prepare to let in, who knows, you know, 100,000, 200,000, a million migrants back into Sweden, even though they've got the highest Muslim migrant population in comparison to the host population in Europe.
[00:09:14.928 --> 00:09:17.488]  It's going to be a very interesting discussion.
[00:09:17.528 --> 00:09:24.650]  We've bashed on Sweden so many times in the past, of course, making the distinction between the government and the people of Sweden.
[00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:26.970]  But this is going to be an illustration
[00:09:27.711 --> 00:09:36.615]  Into what happens to a country when liberalism, as they call it, as they define it, or when progressivism runs rampant.
[00:09:36.635 --> 00:09:38.456]  So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:39.397 --> 00:09:44.399]  But the top story, my story on Infowars.com today, is this.
[00:09:44.479 --> 00:09:51.082]  CNN analyst says Trump carson to blame if German shoots Muslims in a mosque.
[00:09:51.622 --> 00:09:55.284]  So basically this leftist got up on CNN and said,
[00:09:56.019 --> 00:10:11.387]  If a nutcase goes on a rampage in a Muslim mosque, then Ben Carson and Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidates, will be to blame simply because they criticize radical Islam.
[00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:14.649]  And you probably saw the clip on InfoWars a couple of days ago.
[00:10:15.169 --> 00:10:22.573]  It was Ben Carson in an interview with Jake Tapper of ABC News, and basically all he said
[00:10:23.263 --> 00:10:31.048]  Would we ever accept a presidential candidate that would apply the same rules, would say the same things about Jews and black?
[00:10:31.448 --> 00:10:36.191]  We would never tolerate them, would never respect them, would never expect even
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:59.707]  Even accept them, we will shun them aside, but we accept it against Muslims, because sadly, in the Republican base, this is what is appealing to them today.
[00:11:00.267 --> 00:11:05.811]  And not only that, what happened, let me just finish this please, because it's very important.
[00:11:06.051 --> 00:11:16.719]  What happened with Trump, we are discussing the first part of what was said and Trump endorsed, which is we have a problem called Muslims, but there's a second part, how to get rid of them.
[00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:28.049]  And in the realm of possibility, in a country that is very armed, that somebody that will be carrying weapon will go to a mosque tomorrow or after tomorrow and will start shooting people.
[00:11:28.149 --> 00:11:30.531]  And then these people will have blood on their hands.
[00:11:30.852 --> 00:11:31.292]  All of them.
[00:11:31.652 --> 00:11:35.156]  Carson, Trump, and Ted Cruz.
[00:11:35.176 --> 00:11:37.798]  That's the clip from CNN.
[00:11:38.058 --> 00:11:41.862]  And basically, as you heard, she was making the argument completely ridiculous.
[00:11:42.546 --> 00:11:48.308]  That because Trump said that radical Islam is a problem, and that's basically all he said.
[00:11:48.668 --> 00:11:53.270]  You know, he got up and did a speech and said that, you know, Muslims are a problem in America.
[00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:59.232]  He did an interview with CNN after the fact and said, yes, radical Islam is a problem.
[00:11:59.492 --> 00:12:01.793]  Like, that would be a controversial statement.
[00:12:02.153 --> 00:12:04.274]  Like, that would be shocking in any context.
[00:12:04.334 --> 00:12:06.014]  Of course radical Islam is a problem.
[00:12:06.574 --> 00:12:07.695]  And then Ben Carson.
[00:12:08.735 --> 00:12:10.796]  All he basically said was that if you
[00:12:11.641 --> 00:12:21.443]  Take the tenets of the Quran and Sharia law into the office of President, then that is incompatible with the US Constitution.
[00:12:21.843 --> 00:12:28.525]  That's incompatible with basic freedom, basic rights as we understand them to exist in America.
[00:12:29.145 --> 00:12:32.186]  And again, why is that even controversial in the first place?
[00:12:32.226 --> 00:12:36.367]  So, this woman, this supposed geopolitical analyst,
[00:12:37.116 --> 00:12:47.378]  Gets up on Don Lemon's show and says, this is going to cause some right-wing nutcase, some lunatic, to go postal in a mosque and start shooting up Muslims.
[00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:57.941]  Which is funny because, you know, when jihadists who shoot up places in Garland, or at least attempt to, they weren't successful because America has the Second Amendment.
[00:12:58.161 --> 00:13:06.223]  They were successful in Paris at the Charlie Hebdo shootings, because of course we've been completely disarmed in Europe, we can't protect ourselves.
[00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:09.735]  There's no condemnation whatsoever.
[00:13:10.796 --> 00:13:14.458]  As happened in Paris and Golan, who do liberals blame?
[00:13:15.038 --> 00:13:16.439]  Do they blame Islam?
[00:13:16.939 --> 00:13:24.503]  Do they blame Islamic hate preachers for spreading the kind of hate that justifies such acts?
[00:13:25.443 --> 00:13:29.405]  No, they blame the cartoonists for quote, provoking the jihadists.
[00:13:29.926 --> 00:13:30.366]  And in fact,
[00:13:31.704 --> 00:13:43.197]  A day after the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris, Chris Matthews came out on MSNBC and said that the cartoonists themselves were to blame for provoking the attack.
[00:13:43.858 --> 00:13:52.868]  And even the Pope rhetorically sided with the Charlie Hebdo jihadists, with the Islamist terrorists, because he asserted that
[00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:59.009]  You know, insulting someone's religion shouldn't be a part of free speech.
[00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:14.920]  So the entirety of the leftist media, after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, after the attacks in Garland, Texas, where they tried to shoot up a Draw Mohammed cartoon exhibition, were completely aligned behind the notion that
[00:14:15.669 --> 00:14:19.411]  The people to blame for this were the people drawing the cartoons.
[00:14:19.732 --> 00:14:30.898]  And yet this woman is saying, no, it's the rhetoric from Donald Trump and Ben Carson that will be to blame when some, you know, right-wing Christian lunatic shoots up a mosque.
[00:14:31.139 --> 00:14:36.442]  So it's a fundamental hypocrisy, which we see again and again with the leftist media.
[00:14:37.122 --> 00:14:42.746]  You know, did liberals blame Obama and the Democratic base when Bryce Williams
[00:14:44.093 --> 00:14:50.196]  Executed a TV reporter live on air, Alison Parker, and her cameraman.
[00:14:50.957 --> 00:14:55.739]  His manifesto said that he did that to try and start a, quote, race war.
[00:14:56.139 --> 00:15:05.925]  The same race war that has been promulgated by the Black Lives Matter movement, which has been supported, at least tacitly, by the Obama administration.
[00:15:06.485 --> 00:15:11.188]  Was the blame laid at the door of the Obama administration for that violent act?
[00:15:11.768 --> 00:15:11.888]  No.
[00:15:13.436 --> 00:15:16.858]  was the blame for the NYPD killings back in December.
[00:15:17.659 --> 00:15:28.166]  Ishmael Brinsley shot two NYPD officers in the head, in his own words, as a quote, revenge attack for Black Lives Matter.
[00:15:29.067 --> 00:15:38.053]  We've had Black Lives Matter activists plan to bomb police headquarters in Ferguson, again, to get revenge
[00:15:38.703 --> 00:15:40.944]  For their supposed political motivation.
[00:15:41.444 --> 00:15:43.805]  Was that blamed on the Obama administration?
[00:15:43.845 --> 00:15:48.507]  Was that blamed on the Democratic base by the leftist media?
[00:15:49.087 --> 00:15:49.267]  No.
[00:15:50.507 --> 00:15:53.208]  Then we had Floyd Lee Corkins.
[00:15:53.849 --> 00:16:01.431]  This is the guy who was so upset over the Family Research Council opposing gay marriage.
[00:16:01.912 --> 00:16:05.713]  Again, at the same time as the Obama administration tried to
[00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.572]  You know, get this Supreme Court ruling passed on gay marriage.
[00:16:09.652 --> 00:16:10.993]  They were activists for that.
[00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:23.162]  He went into the Family Research Council, basically tried to kill as many people as possible, and his motivation was the conservative beliefs of this organization.
[00:16:23.703 --> 00:16:26.165]  Was that act blamed on Obama?
[00:16:26.425 --> 00:16:28.466]  Was that act blamed on the Democrats?
[00:16:29.227 --> 00:16:29.427]  No.
[00:16:30.248 --> 00:16:30.588]  So again,
[00:16:31.618 --> 00:16:39.439]  You know, whenever someone like Dylan Roof in Charleston goes on a rampage, they lay the blame at the door of conservatives.
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:50.762]  But when a Muslim jihadist goes on a killing spree, the blame is laid at the door of those who dared to offend the terrorist killers.
[00:16:51.162 --> 00:16:52.222]  We saw it in Paris.
[00:16:52.582 --> 00:16:53.702]  We saw it in Garland.
[00:16:53.962 --> 00:16:55.442]  We saw it in Copenhagen.
[00:16:56.042 --> 00:16:58.543]  And again, no blame is apportioned to the fact that
[00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:08.058]  Passages in the Quran legitimize, encourage and justify the bloodshed that has been carried out in the name of Islam.
[00:17:08.539 --> 00:17:16.890]  Which again is not to say that you don't make the distinction between moderate Muslims who don't support this and the extremists who do.
[00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:29.908]  But don't go and blame Donald Trump and Ben Carson for a rampage, a massacre that hasn't even happened simply because they were critical of radical Islam.
[00:17:30.428 --> 00:17:31.909]  It's completely ridiculous.
[00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:40.635]  But I guess the solution is, you know, just not to talk about politics or religion whatsoever in public.
[00:17:40.676 --> 00:17:42.737]  And if we can get that Mark Dice clip queued up.
[00:17:43.297 --> 00:17:46.740]  Mark Dice actually went out on the streets of San Diego and
[00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:53.103]  You know, he continues to top himself in the ludicrousness of what these leftists will support.
[00:17:53.603 --> 00:18:00.645]  And they actually supported banning the discussion of politics and religion in public.
[00:18:00.665 --> 00:18:03.966]  So this, you know, we don't even have to debate about this anymore because
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.102]  As long as we shut down free speech, no one's going to be able to have an opinion.
[00:18:08.522 --> 00:18:12.624]  And this is all being pushed, again, by the authoritarian left.
[00:18:12.705 --> 00:18:13.705]  Let's go to that clip.
[00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:21.750]  We need a few more signatures for a new initiative just to prevent, you know, political and religious speech at the beach.
[00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.611]  So just a couple more signatures.
[00:18:24.791 --> 00:18:25.812]  Just print your name there.
[00:18:27.493 --> 00:18:33.236]  We don't really need people talking about politics or religion out in public, right?
[00:18:34.755 --> 00:18:45.805]  There's a time and a place for those kind of discussions, and we're just trying to, you know, mute people's political and religious speech.
[00:18:46.426 --> 00:18:47.807]  Just when they're in public, though.
[00:18:47.827 --> 00:18:51.851]  In private, you can carry on those conversations.
[00:18:52.171 --> 00:18:53.613]  Thank you so much for supporting that.
[00:19:00.114 --> 00:19:17.727]  You know, every time people come to the beach, they don't want to be, you know, hearing people talk about politics or religion and this is a place for fun and sun and a birthday to basically, you know, mute people's political or religious speech.
[00:19:18.207 --> 00:19:22.571]  People don't need to be talking about politics or religion out in public.
[00:19:23.431 --> 00:19:26.253]  You know, yeah, print, birthdate and a signature.
[00:19:27.114 --> 00:19:32.778]  There's a time and a place to talk about politics and religion, and it's not out in public.
[00:19:33.959 --> 00:19:42.266]  It's what your living room is for, and a signature to support banning talking about politics and religion out in public.
[00:19:42.566 --> 00:19:44.247]  Thank you so much for helping out.
[00:19:44.888 --> 00:19:49.251]  Okay, that's Mark Dice's latest Man on the Street video, and if you notice from that,
[00:19:50.325 --> 00:20:03.513]  Actually, one of the people who signs the video is an older man whose father probably fought in the Second World War to defend the very freedoms that we have to express our political and religious views.
[00:20:04.014 --> 00:20:05.154]  Absolutely shocking.
[00:20:05.595 --> 00:20:08.576]  We'll be back with more news after the break.
[00:20:08.636 --> 00:20:09.777]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:20:09.797 --> 00:20:15.821]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[00:20:16.241 --> 00:20:21.203]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[00:20:21.723 --> 00:20:25.724]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about.
[00:20:26.264 --> 00:20:30.125]  This change has deep implications for life in America.
[00:20:30.546 --> 00:20:34.807]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:20:35.387 --> 00:20:38.148]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:20:38.528 --> 00:20:40.749]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[00:20:41.469 --> 00:20:45.411]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[00:20:45.891 --> 00:20:46.391]  They did.
[00:20:46.992 --> 00:20:51.413]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[00:20:52.054 --> 00:20:52.514]  They did.
[00:20:53.194 --> 00:20:56.495]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:20:57.056 --> 00:20:59.056]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:20:59.417 --> 00:21:00.597]  This will affect us all.
[00:21:00.937 --> 00:21:02.858]  You can watch the video for free right now.
[00:21:06.421 --> 00:21:11.865]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[00:21:12.285 --> 00:21:14.266]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[00:21:14.807 --> 00:21:18.429]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:27.156]  Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[00:21:27.496 --> 00:21:30.779]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[00:21:31.639 --> 00:21:34.720]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:39.403]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[00:21:40.143 --> 00:21:44.365]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[00:21:45.065 --> 00:21:47.866]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[00:21:48.227 --> 00:21:50.528]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[00:21:51.308 --> 00:21:57.551]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallets, sleeves, or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.

[00:22:03.943 --> 00:22:05.627]  It is as though the protection is free.

[00:23:11.833 --> 00:23:13.533]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?

[00:24:06.885 --> 00:24:07.686]  Come and take it.
[00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:38.230]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show, this September 30th, 2015 edition.
[00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:40.132]  I'm your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:24:40.152 --> 00:24:45.877]  We've got a couple of guests coming up over the next two hours, which will be really fascinating.
[00:24:45.897 --> 00:24:48.099]  We're going to take your calls as well for those guests.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.661]  Before the break,
[00:24:50.131 --> 00:24:51.893]  We played Mark Dice's video again.
[00:24:52.373 --> 00:24:58.099]  Liberals signing a petition to ban the discussion of politics and religion in public.
[00:24:58.839 --> 00:25:02.363]  And I guess that is a real, solid solution.
[00:25:03.203 --> 00:25:12.889]  For the hate speech being spewed by the likes of Ben Carson and Donald Trump because they dare to criticize radical Islam.
[00:25:13.169 --> 00:25:17.812]  I mean, God forbid that they should have the temerity to do so.
[00:25:18.192 --> 00:25:19.433]  And again, they were savage.
[00:25:19.513 --> 00:25:24.916]  They were absolutely savage by the left-wing media over the past couple of weeks.
[00:25:25.636 --> 00:25:28.378]  Simply for saying, in the case of Ben Carson, that
[00:25:29.392 --> 00:25:35.858]  The tenets of the Quran, if you actually read the passages, are incompatible with the US Constitution.
[00:25:35.898 --> 00:25:49.751]  So if you had a Muslim president that embraced those tenets, there would be a problem with them actually protecting the free speech rights of American citizens if they also believed in Sharia law.
[00:25:50.292 --> 00:25:51.413]  And on the subject of that,
[00:25:52.443 --> 00:25:54.605]  This headline again, absolutely shocking.
[00:25:55.005 --> 00:26:02.712]  Muslim man admits strangling his daughter for dishonor after she was caught stealing condoms.
[00:26:03.412 --> 00:26:05.134]  This is out of BizPak Review.
[00:26:05.554 --> 00:26:14.962]  A Muslim immigrant, and this is in Germany, bearing in mind, this is in Germany where they're now importing hundreds of thousands of these Muslim migrants.
[00:26:15.879 --> 00:26:21.161]  Supposedly Syrian refugees, only one-fifth of them are actually Syrian.
[00:26:21.622 --> 00:26:27.164]  They're importing them en masse, and this is the kind of culture that they're now importing.
[00:26:28.024 --> 00:26:40.350]  A Muslim immigrant from Pakistan who strangled his daughter and hid her body in a forest told the courtroom he killed her because he was enraged that she'd been caught stealing condoms.
[00:26:41.414 --> 00:26:45.757]  That's worthy of the death penalty under Sharia law.
[00:26:46.277 --> 00:26:52.202]  Again, even if you entertain the notion that she was having sex with someone, you know, God forbid.
[00:26:53.242 --> 00:26:54.683]  There wasn't even any proof of that.
[00:26:54.764 --> 00:26:59.247]  She stole some condoms, according to the Australian news agency News.com.
[00:27:00.194 --> 00:27:16.797]  The murder took place in Darmstadt, Germany in January, when 51-year-old Asadullah Khan killed 19-year-old daughter Lareeb Khan for bringing, quote, dishonor to her family with a man she'd been forbidden to date.
[00:27:17.478 --> 00:27:25.459]  And again, bearing in mind, in Pakistan, there are 1,000 honor killings per year, mostly of women.
[00:27:25.939 --> 00:27:28.540]  And in many cases, it's because they marry somebody
[00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:32.750]  To whom their parents don't consent them to marry.
[00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:37.253]  And in other cases, they look at a man twice.
[00:27:37.873 --> 00:27:40.034]  That is the death penalty sentence.
[00:27:40.574 --> 00:27:46.537]  Looking at a man twice requires an honour killing, in some cases, in Pakistan.
[00:27:46.817 --> 00:27:48.918]  A thousand cases a year of this.
[00:27:49.458 --> 00:27:55.261]  Now these Muslim migrants are travelling to Germany and this is the culture that they're importing.
[00:27:55.682 --> 00:27:58.563]  His wife, who was involved in this plot, Shazia Khan,
[00:27:59.264 --> 00:28:05.590]  Told the German court she helped her husband hide the woman's body because she was afraid of him.
[00:28:06.511 --> 00:28:17.021]  The family had been arguing about Lareeb Khan's boyfriend, the news agency reported, and Asadullah Khan had attempted to strangle his daughter once before.
[00:28:17.041 --> 00:28:19.664]  So this wasn't the first time.
[00:28:20.333 --> 00:28:27.238]  And basically they got a letter from the police saying that there was some evidence that this girl had stole some condoms.
[00:28:27.578 --> 00:28:32.841]  They then took that as evidence that she was having sex with someone else without their permission.
[00:28:34.062 --> 00:28:41.187]  The husband burst into her bedroom immediately upon finding this out and strangled her.
[00:28:41.627 --> 00:28:43.088]  Strangled her to death.
[00:28:43.897 --> 00:28:50.619]  And where were the feminists with their outrage about the patriarchy and about the oppression of women?
[00:28:51.119 --> 00:28:55.101]  Bearing in mind this is in Europe, this is not even in the Middle East, this is in Europe.
[00:28:55.381 --> 00:28:58.442]  They were absolutely nowhere to be seen.
[00:28:58.782 --> 00:29:05.024]  They're too busy whining to the UN about how mean tweets need to be censored.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:20.451]  And the entirety of the social media networks, Facebook, Twitter, need to be controlled by the UN or by governments that follow UN mandates because you can't say a feminist sucks or you can't say they're a liar.
[00:29:20.872 --> 00:29:22.413]  That's true misogyny.
[00:29:22.813 --> 00:29:32.460]  Meanwhile, people in Europe, women, young women, teenagers, are getting strangled to death for, quote, stealing condoms.
[00:29:33.081 --> 00:29:34.382]  Now, which is the greater
[00:29:35.231 --> 00:29:38.836]  Tragedy, which is the greater issue in comparison.
[00:29:38.896 --> 00:29:43.543]  Mean tweets or getting strangled to death by men for stealing condoms.
[00:29:43.944 --> 00:29:45.686]  Yet the feminists don't talk about it.
[00:29:45.726 --> 00:29:47.028]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[00:29:47.449 --> 00:29:49.091]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:29:49.111 --> 00:29:49.532]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:58.163 --> 00:30:01.185]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.105 --> 00:30:04.886]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.489 --> 00:30:12.470]  This article from Medical Express appeared on the Drudge Report.
[00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:15.712]  Chemical exposure linked to rising diabetes, obesity risk.
[00:30:15.992 --> 00:30:23.276]  Emerging evidence ties endocrine disrupting chemical exposure to two of the biggest public health threats facing society, diabetes and obesity.
[00:30:23.436 --> 00:30:26.117]  And that's according to a statement issued by the Endocrine Society.
[00:30:26.277 --> 00:30:35.939]  The statement builds upon the Society's groundbreaking 2009 report, which examines the state of scientific evidence on endocrine-disrupting chemicals, or EDCs, and the risk posed to human health.
[00:30:36.199 --> 00:30:42.060]  I made a search using two words, InfoWars and BPA, and was astounded by the number of times we've covered this subject.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:50.002]  Mounting evidence also indicates that EDC exposure is connected to infertility, hormone-related cancers, neurological issues, and other disorders.
[00:30:50.282 --> 00:30:59.166]  EDCs do this by blocking or otherwise interfering with the body's natural hormones and hijacking the body's chemical messengers, and they can alter the way cells develop and grow.

[00:33:12.964 --> 00:33:19.246]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.665 --> 00:33:37.026]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:37.046 --> 00:33:38.606]  I'm your host Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:33:39.067 --> 00:33:43.408]  Now we've got our next guest coming up and, you know, I've made videos about Sweden.
[00:33:44.388 --> 00:33:46.569]  We tend to rag on Sweden, as it were.
[00:33:46.609 --> 00:33:48.089]  We tend to hate on Sweden.
[00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:53.591]  Because, again, it's the ultimate example of liberalism run rampant.
[00:33:53.731 --> 00:33:54.892]  Liberalism gone mad.
[00:33:55.392 --> 00:34:01.554]  And I made a video probably three, four months ago now called Absolute Proof Liberalism.
[00:34:02.235 --> 00:34:03.616]  Is a mental disorder.
[00:34:04.017 --> 00:34:12.328]  Talking about how some politicians in Sweden, and this is not official government policy yet, but this is what some of them are calling for, the political class.
[00:34:13.214 --> 00:34:23.198]  Calling for giving ISIS militants, people who fought as terrorists in Syria, welfare and jobs, when they return to Sweden.
[00:34:23.478 --> 00:34:26.119]  That's what some people in Sweden are actually calling for.
[00:34:26.479 --> 00:34:28.460]  And we're going to get into the rest of the madness.
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.161]  But somebody then recommended that I check out this guy's videos.
[00:34:33.072 --> 00:34:45.601]  Who goes under the moniker, The Angry Foreigner, and he put out a video called, Welcome to Sweden, which went viral, which got, you know, upwards of 670,000 views.
[00:34:46.462 --> 00:34:48.423]  And then I checked out the rest of his video.
[00:34:49.584 --> 00:34:58.310]  This really is a great example of somebody who has seen the deception in terms of the fact that in Sweden, it's basically almost a hate crime.
[00:34:58.803 --> 00:35:01.185]  To even oppose mass immigration.
[00:35:01.585 --> 00:35:09.651]  And we're going to get into how people are publicly shamed and harassed and hounded simply for having a different opinion.
[00:35:10.532 --> 00:35:13.294]  So, the angry foreigner, welcome to the show.
[00:35:17.517 --> 00:35:23.742]  Now, before we get into the whole migrant issue, which is what two of your recent videos were about,
[00:35:24.577 --> 00:35:30.159]  Just tell people about your background, because as far as I understand it, you're an immigrant yourself, correct?
[00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:31.799]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:31.819 --> 00:35:36.241]  I came to Sweden when I was five years old in 1993.
[00:35:36.861 --> 00:35:39.322]  Me and my family fled the war in the Balkans.
[00:35:39.662 --> 00:35:47.464]  It was a very bloody, horrible conflict between Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Serbs, Orthodox Serbs.
[00:35:48.225 --> 00:35:51.946]  So, yeah, we ended up here in a small town.
[00:35:51.966 --> 00:35:52.326]  I'm not
[00:35:52.526 --> 00:35:53.627]  I'm not even sure you can call it a town.
[00:35:53.647 --> 00:35:54.729]  Maybe it's more like a village.
[00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:58.833]  The population was only a thousand people there.
[00:35:59.474 --> 00:36:04.140]  So it was basically me and a couple of other Bosnian families surrounded by Swedes.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.462]  And it was, you know, it was great.
[00:36:06.522 --> 00:36:08.505]  It was the complete opposite of segregation.
[00:36:09.953 --> 00:36:15.095]  And I remember actually that my first day in school, I was terrified.
[00:36:15.115 --> 00:36:21.058]  I was freaking out because I was sitting there in the classroom and I didn't know a word of Swedish.
[00:36:21.158 --> 00:36:24.999]  So it was like being an alien visiting a foreign planet.
[00:36:25.539 --> 00:36:30.441]  And when you're little like that, social acceptance is very, very important.
[00:36:31.162 --> 00:36:34.683]  So I made sure to learn Swedish very fast.
[00:36:35.123 --> 00:36:40.185]  And managed to learn it better than a lot of the students in my class, actually.
[00:36:42.946 --> 00:36:44.527]  So you're an immigrant.
[00:36:44.567 --> 00:36:46.387]  You assimilated very quickly.
[00:36:46.647 --> 00:36:47.568]  You integrated.
[00:36:47.868 --> 00:36:49.068]  You learned the language.
[00:36:50.029 --> 00:36:51.669]  So you're there growing up in Sweden.
[00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:57.131]  Now you're making these videos critical of immigrants being brought into Sweden.
[00:36:57.672 --> 00:37:01.353]  And basically what people want to know to outline this whole scenario is
[00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:14.899]  You know, in terms of this cult-like adherence to these leftist policies in Sweden, particularly as it relates to mass immigration, and the drowning out of voices of dissent against that.
[00:37:15.279 --> 00:37:21.824]  Because, you know, at least in Britain, we've got the Labour Party, we've got the left who always advocate mass immigration.
[00:37:22.204 --> 00:37:26.467]  You know, we voted the Conservatives into power to try and, you know, at least
[00:37:27.335 --> 00:37:30.457]  tamp down on that mass immigration to a certain extent.
[00:37:30.537 --> 00:37:31.297]  It didn't work.
[00:37:31.437 --> 00:37:33.018]  Mass immigration only increased.
[00:37:33.298 --> 00:37:40.162]  But at least we've got an acceptance of the fact that criticizing mass immigration is a social issue.
[00:37:40.422 --> 00:37:41.762]  It's an economic issue.
[00:37:42.223 --> 00:37:46.205]  And simply doing it doesn't automatically make you a racist.
[00:37:46.625 --> 00:37:52.568]  At least in many European countries, we still hold to that standard of political discourse.
[00:37:53.008 --> 00:37:56.330]  But it seems that in Sweden, even to question
[00:37:57.102 --> 00:38:04.985]  The policy of mass uncontrolled immigration is inherently racist and proves that you're a white supremacist or whatever.
[00:38:05.285 --> 00:38:14.128]  So what people want to know, as far as I'm concerned, is how bad is it in terms of people who express dissent against this mass immigration policy?
[00:38:14.508 --> 00:38:15.929]  How much are they frowned upon?
[00:38:16.329 --> 00:38:21.711]  How much are they shamed by the media, by the political class in Sweden?
[00:38:23.677 --> 00:38:28.078]  It's sort of like blacks in the 50s except nobody is getting lynched.
[00:38:30.419 --> 00:38:53.126]  I'm actually surprised that we don't have like diversity lovers only restaurants and toilets and you know bus seats because it's bad like it's ridiculous and while that was a joke and exaggeration there's a point to it like you definitely have to think about what you say because there's there is the risk of
[00:38:53.999 --> 00:38:56.721]  Losing friends and you might even lose your job.
[00:38:57.241 --> 00:39:07.288]  I mean, there are certain professions, like if you're a journalist or an academic or a teacher, especially a teacher, you can't criticize mass immigration or multiculturalism.
[00:39:07.648 --> 00:39:12.732]  You especially cannot say that the Sweden Democrats have a few valid points.
[00:39:12.812 --> 00:39:14.213]  That's like social suicide.
[00:39:14.813 --> 00:39:22.596]  But at the same time, we have like 58%, a poll showed that 58% of the population think that immigration is too large.
[00:39:23.096 --> 00:39:29.558]  So a large portion of the people are aware that there are problems with our immigration policy.
[00:39:30.138 --> 00:39:33.800]  But those people don't necessarily have the balls.
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:46.203]  So if you were to be vocal, like I've had so many people write me and tell me that they totally agree with what I'm saying, but they don't dare share my videos on Facebook.
[00:39:47.023 --> 00:39:53.104]  They don't dare be vocal and public about their opinions because they're afraid of social exclusion.
[00:39:54.084 --> 00:39:55.485]  And it's really interesting because
[00:39:56.545 --> 00:40:11.511]  There is a strong consensus culture here and you know when we when we think of Orwellian societies where people aren't allowed to speak their minds we usually think of the presence of a strong military force and like laws punishing people who say certain things.
[00:40:12.231 --> 00:40:16.092]  You don't need laws in Sweden because people censor themselves.
[00:40:16.933 --> 00:40:24.576]  People are there's a form of social control instead through taboos and norms and I would say that the media is
[00:40:25.709 --> 00:40:40.809]  Largely responsible for this because for years they have been beating in this, and a politician, beating in this notion that immigration is good, immigration is going to serve us all, and you're racist if you think otherwise.
[00:40:42.153 --> 00:40:49.216]  There's a lot of people who have discovered my videos and said that, wow, I thought I was the only person who thought like this.
[00:40:49.956 --> 00:40:56.059]  And when you get like hundreds of people saying, I thought I was the only person, it becomes kind of ridiculous.
[00:40:56.359 --> 00:41:03.162]  It becomes obvious that people, so many people are living in some kind of bubble of fear, like they're afraid to speak.
[00:41:04.022 --> 00:41:08.909]  With their environment, with their surroundings, about how they truly feel.
[00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:13.556]  So when they discover me, it's like this massive relief for them.
[00:41:13.716 --> 00:41:17.442]  And, you know, that's pretty bad if you ask me.
[00:41:17.913 --> 00:41:21.696]  Also, there's people who genuinely think I'm a Nazi.
[00:41:22.437 --> 00:41:26.340]  Like, they seriously believe that I like Hitler.
[00:41:26.861 --> 00:41:36.509]  And just as you said, if you criticize the immigration policy, people immediately think that it's something personal with the immigrants.
[00:41:37.518 --> 00:41:43.501]  Obviously that isn't the case because I'm an immigrant and I don't have a problem with immigrants.
[00:41:43.561 --> 00:41:52.627]  I have a problem with irresponsible immigration policy and that's what, that's the only, that's the one single word I would use to describe Sweden's immigration policy.
[00:41:52.947 --> 00:41:53.527]  Irresponsible.
[00:41:55.428 --> 00:42:05.694]  And you mentioned, you know, peer pressure and this is what I've found, especially in Europe, I don't think Americans appreciate this to such an extent that they need to, is the fact that
[00:42:06.172 --> 00:42:09.273]  You know, I assume that you're in your 20s or 30s.
[00:42:09.353 --> 00:42:17.135]  I'm in my 30s right now, so... Amongst people in your age group, it's not seen as trendy or kosher or acceptable.
[00:42:17.455 --> 00:42:22.096]  Again, as he said, it's seen as a taboo to even hold some of these viewpoints.
[00:42:22.456 --> 00:42:25.717]  So the government doesn't really need to censor them.
[00:42:25.757 --> 00:42:27.837]  They don't need to be so authoritarian.
[00:42:28.198 --> 00:42:30.738]  Although there are some examples which we will go on to.
[00:42:31.118 --> 00:42:33.879]  But they don't need to be, you know, so crushing.
[00:42:34.676 --> 00:42:41.339]  In their totalitarianism in terms of centering these viewpoints because the sheep will police the other sheep.
[00:42:41.919 --> 00:42:53.005]  So if you're around a group of young people who are, you know, Western Europeans, they will generally hold to the beliefs that they were indoctrinated to believe in.
[00:42:53.065 --> 00:43:03.870]  They won't dare venture into any of the taboos, which of course is mass immigration in terms of Sweden has not been generally successful
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:16.498]  In practical terms and in social terms, talk about the housing shortage that is currently taking place in Sweden and how that conflicts with this mass immigration policy.
[00:43:17.785 --> 00:43:26.229]  Right, well, you know, it's funny because a lot of people say I'm a hypocrite because I came here as a refugee, so how can I deny others the chance?
[00:43:27.009 --> 00:43:30.450]  There's a huge difference between the situation today and the situation in the 90s.
[00:43:30.571 --> 00:43:40.695]  In the 90s, we actually had room for people, like there were apartments standing around empty all over Sweden.
[00:43:41.215 --> 00:43:50.480]  Now we have a housing shortage so bad, people who graduated can't move out of their parents' house because there aren't enough apartments.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:44:00.045]  According to the Department of Housing, we need to build 600,000 apartments within the next 11 years to accommodate everyone in need.
[00:44:00.425 --> 00:44:02.886]  So basically, we need to build a new Stockholm.
[00:44:02.906 --> 00:44:09.509]  We need to build a new capital city the size of that in order to accommodate everyone.
[00:44:09.569 --> 00:44:10.810]  And it's ridiculous because
[00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:23.442]  Now we have a thousand refugees a day coming to Sweden, and they're looking to set up a refugee camp outside of Kristianstad, which is close to Malmö.
[00:44:23.522 --> 00:44:24.543]  It's down in the south.
[00:44:25.811 --> 00:44:42.705]  Basically, there's this massive field, this massive green field that's normally used for things like international scout meetings or military shit, and they're planning on turning that into a refugee camp somehow.
[00:44:42.786 --> 00:44:45.248]  They said that it can house up to 40,000 people.
[00:44:46.992 --> 00:44:49.914]  So, I mean, that's just insane to me.
[00:44:49.954 --> 00:44:51.455]  That's crazy.
[00:44:51.775 --> 00:44:58.120]  The guy who is supporting this initiative compared it to a refugee camp in northern Iraq.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.362]  And I'm like, that's not a good thing.
[00:45:01.442 --> 00:45:03.103]  Like, that doesn't sound like a good thing.
[00:45:04.384 --> 00:45:04.904]  It's crazy.
[00:45:07.526 --> 00:45:08.787]  And another story again.
[00:45:09.987 --> 00:45:12.829]  So basically, you've got no room for immigrants.
[00:45:12.889 --> 00:45:16.752]  Again, in Germany, Belgium and other countries, we've seen stories about
[00:45:17.386 --> 00:45:25.929]  The poor, the would-be homeless being kicked out of their homes to house this new influx of migrants that is coming in over the past few months.
[00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:29.351]  Basically you've got a housing shortage in Sweden.
[00:45:29.491 --> 00:45:31.872]  It's impractical that you could house these people.
[00:45:32.392 --> 00:45:36.153]  But we've also got this public shaming angle which I want to touch on again.
[00:45:36.753 --> 00:45:40.715]  We carried an article on Infowars about a year ago now which was called
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.121]  Sweden!
[00:45:42.501 --> 00:45:45.925]  Immigration critics get home visits from thought police.
[00:45:46.365 --> 00:45:57.297]  One of Sweden's biggest newspapers, Expressen, used criminal hackers to break into Discus, which, if you don't know what that is, it's basically a comment system for news articles.
[00:45:57.317 --> 00:45:58.739]  We use it on Infowars.com.
[00:45:59.781 --> 00:46:12.747]  So they use this hacking group to break into discus and get the email addresses and identities of commenters online and to reveal the persons behind the nicknames or anonymous user IDs.
[00:46:13.468 --> 00:46:18.350]  So then this newspaper actually sent a reporter and a cameraman
[00:46:18.931 --> 00:46:35.714]  To these people's homes, these people who had merely criticised mass immigration in Sweden on, you know, internet news articles and basically publicly shamed them and then put their images, put their video on the newspaper website, you know, on YouTube.
[00:46:36.883 --> 00:46:46.365]  So you've got thought police actually going out and physically harassing people in Sweden simply for criticizing mass immigration.
[00:46:46.705 --> 00:46:52.227]  Now I know that you use the, you know, the moniker, the angry foreigner on your YouTube channel.
[00:46:52.787 --> 00:46:56.428]  Is that because the situation in Sweden is so intense?
[00:46:57.148 --> 00:46:58.128]  It's so oppressive?
[00:46:58.635 --> 00:47:12.573]  That critics of mass immigration could be targeted simply for banal online comments which aren't racist, which aren't xenophobic, merely drawing attention to the economic and the social impacts of mass immigration.
[00:47:12.634 --> 00:47:15.858]  Is that a concern for people in Sweden right now?
[00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:20.833]  Well yeah, I mean, there's a need for anonymity, I could say.
[00:47:21.994 --> 00:47:29.480]  Me personally, I just don't feel like having my window smashed, or having shit sent to my mailbox, or you know, eggs.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.061]  So I just want to be comfortable.
[00:47:31.502 --> 00:47:37.987]  And I'm not really interested in people knocking on my door, whether it's fans wanting autographs, or annoying critics.
[00:47:38.428 --> 00:47:39.989]  I just don't want to meet people.
[00:47:40.569 --> 00:47:42.711]  When it comes to Expressen though, you're right.
[00:47:42.791 --> 00:47:45.654]  They did, and actually, I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but
[00:47:46.414 --> 00:47:51.538]  This hacker group that they worked together with are militant left-wingers.
[00:47:52.199 --> 00:47:53.941]  They are Antifa.
[00:47:53.981 --> 00:47:55.822]  Are you familiar with the organization Antifa?
[00:47:56.743 --> 00:47:57.604]  Yeah, I've heard of it, yeah.
[00:47:58.144 --> 00:48:05.410]  Yeah, basically it's Antifa evolved into, you know, they used to be Antifa hackers before.
[00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:07.252]  So that's their background.
[00:48:07.912 --> 00:48:11.495]  And it's insane that nobody is, you know,
[00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:19.165]  The only ones criticizing the fact that our mass media is cooperating with left-wing extremists is the alternative media.
[00:48:19.526 --> 00:48:24.412]  They're the only ones who did this huge audit of who these people are.
[00:48:24.432 --> 00:48:28.377]  I partly have to defend it because
[00:48:30.298 --> 00:48:36.001]  Some of those people were politicians and it was blatantly racist things.
[00:48:36.121 --> 00:48:37.661]  It wasn't just sensible criticism.
[00:48:38.161 --> 00:48:44.144]  So I can sort of understand wanting to audit politicians and people who are in power.
[00:48:44.949 --> 00:48:54.471]  However, they also named and shamed people who aren't politicians, people who simply, you know, someone who owns a company, for example, workers.
[00:48:55.051 --> 00:49:02.173]  Another newspaper, Aftonbladet, which is the second or, well, Expressen and Aftonbladet are the two biggest newspapers in Sweden.
[00:49:02.653 --> 00:49:06.714]  They did the same thing and it wasn't even with politicians.
[00:49:06.814 --> 00:49:10.035]  They took this guy who wrote like this,
[00:49:11.275 --> 00:49:12.616]  It was sort of a funny post.
[00:49:12.656 --> 00:49:20.180]  I mean, he basically wrote out a fantasy about how he wanted to murder this fat, annoying, radical feminist who was on Swedish radio.
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:22.761]  And you could tell that the guy was joking.
[00:49:22.801 --> 00:49:28.324]  I mean, he basically laid out this video game scenario... Which, you know, feminists threaten to kill all men constantly.
[00:49:28.504 --> 00:49:30.025]  They can get away with it, that's fine.
[00:49:30.725 --> 00:49:34.787]  Yeah, exactly, because this feminist said some horrible shit, right?
[00:49:35.488 --> 00:49:37.689]  But, you know, she's a part of the mass media.
[00:49:37.709 --> 00:49:38.789]  She's a part of the establishment.
[00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:39.810]  Nobody criticizes her.
[00:49:40.697 --> 00:49:45.560]  But yeah, he basically wrote a post about how he wanted to, you know, go to the TV station and kill everyone.
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:51.403]  And they visited him in his home and tried to make him feel ashamed of having these thoughts.
[00:49:51.964 --> 00:49:54.365]  Funny thing about that was that he had no shame.
[00:49:54.405 --> 00:49:58.087]  He was just like, well, you know, I'm going to stand by what I said.
[00:49:58.327 --> 00:49:58.928]  It was a joke.
[00:49:58.968 --> 00:49:59.888]  You're taking it seriously.
[00:49:59.908 --> 00:50:00.408]  You're a fool.
[00:50:00.448 --> 00:50:00.869]  That's it.
[00:50:00.929 --> 00:50:04.090]  Like, so it didn't really work because that guy had guts.
[00:50:05.131 --> 00:50:26.613]  But that's the type of stuff our mass media is doing and recently actually they decided to publicly name a shame a 70 year old woman with a heart condition because she was writing racist things online and that's just amazing to me because
[00:50:27.802 --> 00:50:29.863]  There is no need for this.
[00:50:30.383 --> 00:50:36.506]  Like, they were using the reasoning that democracy feels better this way.
[00:50:36.766 --> 00:50:41.628]  If everyone stands for what they say, we're gonna have a healthier opinion and debate climate.
[00:50:41.648 --> 00:50:49.871]  And I'm like, you wrote an article about her without even addressing a single counter-argument to anything she has said.
[00:50:50.191 --> 00:50:56.620]  You were literally just trying to scare her into silence, and thus scare everyone else into silence.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:01.587]  They're trying to use, like, this iron grip on the population to keep them from expressing themselves.
[00:51:02.789 --> 00:51:07.155]  And it's truly... I mean, it's some dictatorship bullshit.
[00:51:09.489 --> 00:51:13.730]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:17.811]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[00:51:17.971 --> 00:51:25.152]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[00:51:25.312 --> 00:51:30.353]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[00:51:30.573 --> 00:51:39.015]  If you want to boost your omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:33.070]  I'm 25 years old.
[00:53:33.491 --> 00:53:36.433]  At the end of a tiring work shift, I used to not do much around the house.
[00:53:36.673 --> 00:53:46.800]  Since I started taking the new Technology Enhance One World Way after work, I have so much energy when I get home that I'm able to take long walks, do chores, and even honey to-do lists from the wife.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:51.563]  It's plenty enough energy to get things done around the house and time to settle down before bedtime.
[00:53:51.763 --> 00:53:55.806]  This whey protein gives me outstanding amount of long-lasting feel-good energy.

[00:54:24.403 --> 00:54:26.124]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:26.144 --> 00:54:28.065]  We're talking to the Angry Foreigner.
[00:54:28.305 --> 00:54:32.227]  And if you haven't seen his videos, definitely go to YouTube and check them out.
[00:54:32.267 --> 00:54:34.188]  Just search for the Angry Foreigner.
[00:54:34.808 --> 00:54:38.710]  Welcome to Sweden is his most popular, as far as I've seen.
[00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:41.911]  It's got over 670,000 views.
[00:54:41.971 --> 00:54:47.354]  It went viral a few months ago and he's made several English language videos since.
[00:54:48.058 --> 00:54:53.780]  We're going to take your calls for the angry foreigner at 800-259-9231.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.380]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:55:04.823]  We're talking about Sweden, which again is the ultimate example of rampant liberalism gone mad.
[00:55:04.863 --> 00:55:06.964]  They've got a mass open border policy.
[00:55:07.704 --> 00:55:09.365]  We're going to talk about the impacts of that.
[00:55:10.145 --> 00:55:12.866]  But the angry foreigner, as far as I understand,
[00:55:13.715 --> 00:55:32.670]  The official in charge of your anti-extremism policy, or your anti-islamophobia policy, there in Sweden, this was a top-ranking official, he was so liberal, he was so trendy, that he actually went on to join ISIS, is that correct?
[00:55:34.491 --> 00:55:37.874]  We had... what was his title, did you say?
[00:55:39.055 --> 00:55:41.737]  He was the head of the anti-islamophobia
[00:55:42.915 --> 00:55:45.017]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:45.497 --> 00:55:48.679]  We have a public service debate show called SVT Debatt.
[00:55:49.239 --> 00:55:53.402]  And they hired this guy as some kind of expert on Islamophobia.
[00:55:53.702 --> 00:55:55.543]  And it's freaking hilarious.
[00:55:55.603 --> 00:56:01.186]  This guy was on TV saying that, you know, you shouldn't be prejudiced towards Islam.
[00:56:01.446 --> 00:56:04.808]  You think that these guys just have like beards and AK-47s.
[00:56:06.249 --> 00:56:11.695]  And a couple of years later he's posing with an AK-47 telling people to join the Islamic State.
[00:56:11.815 --> 00:56:14.038]  That's, wow, you can't make that stuff up.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:22.928]  And his name, his name was Michael Nicolai Scramo, but then he had another individual who was basically
[00:56:23.624 --> 00:56:25.326]  He was an expert.
[00:56:25.366 --> 00:56:27.408]  This was in your video, Welcome to Sweden.
[00:56:27.448 --> 00:56:36.876]  He was some kind of expert on Islamic extremism and he was talking about the radicals traveling from Sweden to Syria to fight for ISIS.
[00:56:37.457 --> 00:56:41.401]  And he said that we can't condemn ISIS.
[00:56:41.481 --> 00:56:48.147]  He refused to condemn ISIS even as they were beheading, you know, countless people in the Middle East, correct?
[00:56:48.997 --> 00:56:49.277]  Mm-hmm.
[00:56:50.118 --> 00:56:54.280]  Yeah, that was in my migrant crisis video, actually.
[00:56:54.761 --> 00:56:56.662]  And yeah, it was completely insane.
[00:56:56.682 --> 00:57:01.004]  You know, Gothenburg alone has produced more jihadists than all of America.
[00:57:01.424 --> 00:57:07.548]  Sweden is leading in Scandinavia in ISIS warrior export per capita, so to speak.
[00:57:07.988 --> 00:57:10.550]  And yet we have the least legal, like,
[00:57:12.751 --> 00:57:15.413]  We have the least legislations against terrorism.
[00:57:15.713 --> 00:57:19.215]  It's not illegal to join ISIS here in Sweden.
[00:57:19.676 --> 00:57:21.657]  It's not illegal to recruit for ISIS.
[00:57:21.977 --> 00:57:32.104]  If the National Security Police suspect that you're gonna travel to Syria to join ISIS, all they can do is give you a phone call that you don't even have to like pick up and answer.
[00:57:32.124 --> 00:57:32.164]  So...
[00:57:34.025 --> 00:57:48.436]  It wasn't until April, yeah, the spring this year that Gothenburg assigned someone to firmly and concretely deal with this issue, because this has been going on for like two years at that point.
[00:57:50.077 --> 00:57:52.399]  And when they interviewed him,
[00:57:54.139 --> 00:57:56.901]  As you say, he refused to renounce the Islamic State.
[00:57:56.961 --> 00:58:04.305]  He was of the opinion that, oh, it's unnecessary to talk about Jihad because, you know, people are traveling for different reasons.
[00:58:05.105 --> 00:58:18.452]  Some people traveled to Bosnia in the 90s, and some people traveled to the Finnish Winter War, which was around the time of the Second World War.
[00:58:22.807 --> 00:58:24.688]  We're going to get into that after the break.
[00:58:24.708 --> 00:58:25.508]  We're going to break now.
[00:58:25.529 --> 00:58:27.069]  We're talking to the angry foreigner.
[00:58:27.089 --> 00:58:35.434]  We're going to talk about why, you know, the backlash to this is rising, but still it seems to be oppressed by the media, by society.
[00:58:35.454 --> 00:58:36.815]  We're going to talk to the angry foreigner.
[00:58:37.115 --> 00:58:38.896]  We're going to take your calls after the break.

[01:00:20.081 --> 01:00:20.881]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.662 --> 01:00:22.562]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.202 --> 01:00:26.864]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.404 --> 01:00:31.446]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.403 --> 01:00:41.304]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[01:00:41.384 --> 01:00:45.126]  I'm your host Paul Joseph Fox and we're talking to the angry foreigner.
[01:00:45.166 --> 01:00:50.268]  That's what he goes by on YouTube and you can check out his videos which have been a viral success.
[01:00:50.708 --> 01:00:59.872]  We're talking about Sweden which is a prime case or some would say a basket case for what happens when liberalism runs rampant.
[01:00:59.913 --> 01:01:03.034]  We were talking about how people within Sweden are
[01:01:04.096 --> 01:01:14.484]  Criticised, not only criticised, but actually hounded by the media, by peer pressure, simply for talking out, simply for speaking out against mass immigration.
[01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:21.870]  And I wanted to ask you before we go to calls here, we had the Ikea incident a couple of months ago now.
[01:01:22.591 --> 01:01:29.016]  There was some debate about whether that was a beheading or a, you know, somebody slitting somebody's throat.
[01:01:29.116 --> 01:01:32.519]  It was definitely a terror attack by Islamists
[01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:35.532]  Targeting Swedes in an Ikea store.
[01:01:35.973 --> 01:01:37.094]  We've had stabbings.
[01:01:37.494 --> 01:01:38.935]  We've had grenade attacks.
[01:01:39.476 --> 01:01:40.737]  How bad has it got?
[01:01:40.837 --> 01:01:49.965]  I mean, we hear these stories about, you know, these Muslim ghettos where ambulance men, police, firemen go there to basically just do their job.
[01:01:50.325 --> 01:01:51.887]  They're attacked with stones.
[01:01:51.907 --> 01:01:53.148]  They're attacked with weapons.
[01:01:53.608 --> 01:01:55.830]  How bad have these Muslim ghettos got?
[01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:57.852]  How bad has this tension got?
[01:01:58.292 --> 01:02:06.818]  Do you see there being riots, as there was in Paris a few years ago, arising out of these Muslim ghettos in Sweden?
[01:02:07.058 --> 01:02:13.722]  How high has the tension become to the point where there could be some kind of riot or uprising?
[01:02:15.307 --> 01:02:20.631]  Well, I feel I should point out that it is true that we have no-go zones.
[01:02:20.691 --> 01:02:23.033]  I think we have 55 no-go zones.
[01:02:23.213 --> 01:02:35.242]  And a police chief said, just as he said, that there are certain areas where if the police are following a vehicle and that vehicle travels into a certain neighborhood, they can't follow that vehicle because they will be pelted with rocks.
[01:02:35.462 --> 01:02:38.564]  So that's a no-go zone in every sense of the word.
[01:02:38.605 --> 01:02:39.365]  They can't go there.
[01:02:39.725 --> 01:02:42.187]  But it doesn't really have to do with religion.
[01:02:42.267 --> 01:02:42.888]  I mean, this isn't...
[01:02:44.068 --> 01:02:46.350]  I don't think you could say that these are Muslims.
[01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:57.975]  These are various types of immigrants, and sometimes Swedes, but mostly immigrants in these immigrant-dominated areas who are basically criminals, brats, and I would say that...
[01:02:59.216 --> 01:03:01.217]  It primarily has to do with ghetto culture.
[01:03:01.837 --> 01:03:15.422]  In Sweden, we have immigrants who live in these segregated areas and, you know, they seriously delude themselves into thinking that they have it just as bad as blacks living in Compton, which is ridiculous because
[01:03:15.942 --> 01:03:21.364]  You know, America is worse than Sweden in every way, if you look at poverty and class gaps.
[01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:26.226]  In Sweden, you don't have to be a criminal in order to survive.
[01:03:26.266 --> 01:03:28.708]  You get a pretty nice welfare check here.
[01:03:29.028 --> 01:03:38.492]  I've actually read two articles interviewing these types of young hoodlums, and one article they said that they're robbing
[01:03:39.352 --> 01:03:45.736]  Only Swedish people because they hate Swedes, they hate Swedish society because Swedes are so racist.
[01:03:45.996 --> 01:03:48.758]  So robbing them is their way of fighting the man.
[01:03:49.078 --> 01:03:49.798]  That was one article.
[01:03:50.019 --> 01:04:03.307]  Another article said that... I can't believe I'm gonna say this out loud, but basically they were interviewing an immigrant in the ghetto who said that we turned to crime because we don't have enough money to party.
[01:04:04.426 --> 01:04:08.988]  So these people are not being criminals out of necessity for life.
[01:04:09.068 --> 01:04:15.710]  They're doing it because they're greedy and they've watched too much Scarface movies, listened to too much 50 Cent.
[01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:18.511]  They just want to be cool, essentially.
[01:04:20.692 --> 01:04:28.754]  We do have Sharia police, but it's not as well established as, say, Britain, where they go around putting up stickers.
[01:04:29.294 --> 01:04:44.558]  A couple of months ago, there were these immigrant women who came out in the media and said that they don't feel safe where they live in these segregated ghettos, because there's actual Sharia police walking around telling them what to wear, what to eat.
[01:04:45.158 --> 01:04:47.442]  To avoid hanging out with Swedish people?
[01:04:47.742 --> 01:04:51.048]  That they aren't allowed to sit at a cafe without the company of a man?
[01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:57.838]  That's the type of stuff that's going on, and it's just recently been revealed, so I would say that...
[01:04:58.866 --> 01:05:08.153]  Unless everything changes here in Sweden, we will be heading towards the same fate as England and Paris, for sure.
[01:05:08.253 --> 01:05:15.378]  In the wake of Pope Francis visiting the United States and barely addressing the issue of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, we have this.
[01:05:15.598 --> 01:05:23.686]  Former House Speaker Dennis Hastert negotiating a guilty plea over charges he paid $3.5 million in hush money to cover up sexual contact with a male.
[01:05:23.807 --> 01:05:31.434]  The Daily Mail reports a May indictment says Hastert agreed to pay $3.5 million to someone identified only as Individual A to hide past misconduct.
[01:05:31.555 --> 01:05:35.719]  It has been claimed that Individual A is a victim of sexual abuse that Hastert was attempting to silence.
[01:05:36.019 --> 01:05:43.264]  Citing anonymous sources, the AP reports that the payments were intended to conceal claims of sexual misconduct believed to be linked to his days as a high school teacher.
[01:05:43.504 --> 01:05:48.048]  Before leaving Congress in 2007, Hastert was the longest ever serving Republican speaker.
[01:05:48.088 --> 01:05:51.110]  Because when you have skeletons in the closet, you are easy to control.
[01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:55.153]  Hastert was a wrestling coach and teacher from 1965 to 1981.
[01:05:55.393 --> 01:05:59.396]  Hastert took groups of boys on foreign trips, including diving expeditions to the Bahamas.
[01:05:59.656 --> 01:06:05.218]  And now that John Boehner is stepping down under his own free will, it makes you wonder what skeletons he's hiding in his closet.
[01:06:05.338 --> 01:06:08.199]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:13.981]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:06:14.122 --> 01:06:19.984]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:06:20.224 --> 01:06:22.865]  Methocobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[01:06:23.605 --> 01:06:24.386]  We're good to go.
[01:06:38.724 --> 01:06:39.664]  BrainForce is here.
[01:06:39.845 --> 01:06:41.945]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:06:42.065 --> 01:06:46.787]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:06:47.047 --> 01:06:50.209]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:06:50.329 --> 01:06:53.550]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:55.631]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:06:55.791 --> 01:06:59.793]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.
[01:06:59.913 --> 01:07:05.495]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:07:08.476 --> 01:07:08.997]  I want more candy!
[01:07:09.017 --> 01:07:10.138]  I want more video games!
[01:07:10.178 --> 01:07:10.318]  Mine!
[01:07:10.378 --> 01:07:10.538]  Mine!
[01:07:10.899 --> 01:07:11.419]  Mine!
[01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:21.090]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:07:21.450 --> 01:07:24.013]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:07:24.133 --> 01:07:27.497]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:07:27.697 --> 01:07:30.440]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.360]  We're good to go.
[01:07:53.266 --> 01:08:00.529]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[01:08:00.809 --> 01:08:04.271]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:04.411 --> 01:08:07.993]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:11.614 --> 01:08:13.915]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:14.375 --> 01:08:17.177]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.061 --> 01:08:23.762]  We're back live.
[01:08:23.842 --> 01:08:24.984]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:25.004 --> 01:08:30.171]  We're going to be taking your calls for the Angry Foreigner here live on the show.
[01:08:30.852 --> 01:08:33.155]  Very interesting conversation so far.
[01:08:33.715 --> 01:08:37.661]  But I need to talk about the Infowars store at infowarsstore.com.
[01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:40.482]  And in particular, Liver Shield.
[01:08:40.542 --> 01:08:46.965]  This is an enhanced blend of powerful herbs that support normal cleansing and function of the liver and gallbladder.
[01:08:47.426 --> 01:08:49.867]  Now, I'm deathly ill right now.
[01:08:50.467 --> 01:08:53.889]  I'm plowing through the show even though I've got, you know, man flu.
[01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:58.911]  But I'm actually glad that I got it this week because next week I'm gonna go to Austin.
[01:08:58.931 --> 01:08:59.972]  I'm flying to Austin.
[01:09:00.612 --> 01:09:07.115]  And I'm gonna grab as many of these health products as I can because, as you can see from the website, InfoWarsStore.com,
[01:09:07.853 --> 01:09:13.099]  The independent reviews are overwhelmingly positive and that's, you know, it's not us saying it.
[01:09:13.299 --> 01:09:15.982]  It's independent reviews, people who have got these products.
[01:09:16.503 --> 01:09:19.967]  They've worked for them and they're really having massive benefits.
[01:09:20.227 --> 01:09:28.637]  I need to get my hands on the knockout because I've been taking melatonin which has been hitting me so I'm really looking forward to getting my hands on it.
[01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:37.496]  These health products, which have got rave reviews at InfoWarsStore.com, including Liver Shield, which is currently on sale $29.95.
[01:09:38.537 --> 01:09:40.639]  That's reduced from $39.95 again.
[01:09:41.059 --> 01:09:48.645]  Didn't plug these products last hour, but this is crucial to support what we're doing, because we're not funded by George Soros.
[01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:53.088]  We're not funded by massive, giant pharmaceutical companies.
[01:09:53.468 --> 01:09:58.392]  We're funded by the listeners, by the people who buy these products.
[01:09:58.812 --> 01:10:04.498]  And these products work for them, which is proven by these independent third-party reviews.
[01:10:04.558 --> 01:10:08.823]  And you can see them all on the website at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:10:08.843 --> 01:10:10.885]  But we're talking to the angry foreigner.
[01:10:11.605 --> 01:10:13.607]  That's the moniker he goes by on YouTube.
[01:10:13.647 --> 01:10:16.090]  He's had several viral video hits.
[01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:19.834]  He's an immigrant, a Bosnian immigrant that moved to Sweden.
[01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:26.231]  And is now experiencing the joys, the benefits of mass immigration.
[01:10:26.511 --> 01:10:39.535]  And again, to make that distinction, not immigrants who move there to work hard, to integrate, to assimilate, to learn the language, to contribute something to society, which is, you know, he's a perfect example of that.
[01:10:40.191 --> 01:10:50.160]  But to the people who are being used, for example with this migrant crisis, as a gravy train to dilute people's rights, to dilute social cohesion.
[01:10:50.641 --> 01:10:55.105]  So the EU bureaucracy, which is supported by many European governments,
[01:10:55.751 --> 01:11:12.415]  can take hold and can really federalize to an increasing extent and have people become more dependent on government because there's such a lack of cohesion, a lack of a sense of community, that big government takes its place.
[01:11:13.015 --> 01:11:14.235]  We're going to go to your calls now.
[01:11:14.655 --> 01:11:16.996]  First up, Angelo in New York.
[01:11:17.196 --> 01:11:18.236]  Angelo, you're on the air.
[01:11:18.256 --> 01:11:18.676]  Go ahead.
[01:11:20.177 --> 01:11:23.918]  Hey, Paul Joseph Watson, the angry foreigner.
[01:11:24.738 --> 01:11:25.278]  How are you?
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.160]  Hey, what's going on?
[01:11:28.381 --> 01:11:36.062]  I want to say congratulations to you, the angry foreigner, because it takes a lot of courage to do what you're doing.
[01:11:37.403 --> 01:11:41.744]  And I understand that immigration is an important topic, and it's important to you.
[01:11:42.884 --> 01:11:48.525]  And Planned Parenthood is a similar topic that I felt similar to.
[01:11:49.646 --> 01:11:54.487]  Once I realized, and I did the research, that the fetus reacts to sound,
[01:11:55.296 --> 01:12:01.460]  It outraged me that people were just... Planned Parenthood was chopping up babies.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.461]  I mean, that was just horrible.
[01:12:03.661 --> 01:12:09.165]  And I went out and I spoke out against it, against Planned Parenthood in my neighborhood.
[01:12:10.205 --> 01:12:15.989]  And I put the video up on Facebook, and I got a call from a few friends of mine.
[01:12:16.869 --> 01:12:19.211]  Miss Angelo, are you okay?
[01:12:19.331 --> 01:12:20.532]  I mean, is everything okay?
[01:12:22.297 --> 01:12:23.938]  I'm like, yeah, everything is fine.
[01:12:23.978 --> 01:12:24.218]  Why?
[01:12:24.358 --> 01:12:26.880]  Oh, you made that parenthood video.
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.460]  Oh, is everything okay?
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.161]  You sure?
[01:12:29.181 --> 01:12:32.883]  I'm like, dude, they're chopping up babies, man.
[01:12:32.903 --> 01:12:35.244]  I mean, don't you feel?
[01:12:35.844 --> 01:12:38.986]  Is there anything that you feel feel strong about anything?
[01:12:40.871 --> 01:12:49.135]  I mean, just to jump in, this is what I've found the difference between, you know, quote, liberals and conservatives or liberals and libertarians.
[01:12:49.635 --> 01:13:02.061]  So conservatives and libertarians will be happy to make friends with and to be polite and pleasant towards people with whom they disagree, even if it's on fundamental issues like abortion.
[01:13:02.581 --> 01:13:25.546]  But then, as a Libertarian or as a Conservative, if you kind of venture out into the public commons and dare express your views, which other people might disagree with, it isn't a case where, oh that's okay, we disagree, we can have a debate about it, but then we can come together as friends and, you know, break bread and still remain friends.
[01:13:25.866 --> 01:13:27.266]  But with Liberals it seems like
[01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:31.531]  If you do that, they ostracize you instantly.
[01:13:31.971 --> 01:13:36.933]  It's kind of an immediate backlash, which is what you were talking about in Sweden earlier.
[01:13:37.293 --> 01:13:46.396]  You were talking about the peer pressure, where people will instantly just lash out and ostracize you from a social group if you dare to even
[01:13:47.379 --> 01:13:50.940]  Express any kind of skepticism towards their beliefs, is that correct?
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:54.361]  Yeah, and it's interesting, you know, that's exactly it.
[01:13:54.841 --> 01:13:57.981]  Personally, I consider myself to be a left-winger, I just want to be clear with that.
[01:13:58.161 --> 01:14:04.263]  Like, I'm pro high taxes, free healthcare, free schooling, all that shit.
[01:14:04.623 --> 01:14:10.304]  But I have noticed that people on the left are way more narrow-minded than the opposite, than the other way around.
[01:14:10.384 --> 01:14:13.527]  And there's actually been some experiments on this.
[01:14:13.927 --> 01:14:19.632]  I don't remember the names of those who did the experiment, but a right-wing journalist in Sweden wrote about this.
[01:14:19.692 --> 01:14:29.560]  And he said basically that they investigated how well people can put themselves in their opponents' shoes, argument-wise.
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:35.185]  And it turned out that left-wingers genuinely believe that people to the right
[01:14:35.845 --> 01:14:37.486]  have bad intentions.
[01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:43.768]  Like, they believe that they hate poor people, not that they just want to help them differently.
[01:14:44.488 --> 01:14:55.191]  And, you know, they just can't understand that people can have good intentions and, you know, the same goals, but completely different methods in going about to get to those goals.
[01:14:55.932 --> 01:14:58.532]  So there's definitely something to that.
[01:15:00.093 --> 01:15:00.333]  Right.
[01:15:00.673 --> 01:15:02.874]  And you call yourself a left winger, but again,
[01:15:03.644 --> 01:15:23.156]  It's the fact that so-called progressives have become so authoritarian and so overreaching that left-wingers, classical liberals, now have to go to the lengths to differentiate themselves from these, quote, progressives, because they actually believe in free speech, and though they may disagree with
[01:15:23.736 --> 01:15:36.107]  Conservatives on certain issues, they're willing to have a dialogue, to have a debate, and not immediately react with horror and backlash and try to censor their ideological opponents.
[01:15:36.167 --> 01:15:38.730]  So that's, again, an important distinction to make.
[01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:45.576]  Obviously, you describe yourself as a left-winger, you're obviously a classical liberal, with some views that contradict
[01:15:46.311 --> 01:15:55.278]  Progressives, but now you're being placed under skepticism, under review by progressives because of what you say about mass immigration.
[01:15:55.819 --> 01:15:58.841]  Santino in California, you're on the air, go ahead Santino.
[01:15:59.962 --> 01:16:14.294]  Yes, my question to the angry foreigner is that the majority of the Sunni people, the Sunni Syrian refugees, the majority of the refugees from Syria that are coming to the West,
[01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:34.865]  The majority of them are mostly Sunnis who are fleeing prosecution from Assad, and the majority of the women who are coming that are Sunni are also fleeing prosecution because their sons ended up joining ISIS, their sons ended up getting sniped, and Assad found out where they live.
[01:16:35.285 --> 01:16:40.670]  Now they have to come here, so basically they're going to bring their rhetoric here, they're going to bring every of their
[01:16:42.109 --> 01:16:44.089]  Unless, before I go to the angry foreigner,
[01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:17.076]  The figures show that only one in five of these, quote, refugees coming to Europe are Syrian refugees.
[01:17:17.156 --> 01:17:18.517]  So it's one in five.
[01:17:18.897 --> 01:17:21.439]  The other four in five are coming from Afghanistan.
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.381]  They're coming from Northern Africa.
[01:17:23.821 --> 01:17:32.889]  And that's an important point to make because we've been presented with this narrative by the media that the vast majority of them are Syrian refugees fleeing ISIS.
[01:17:33.311 --> 01:17:34.291]  That's not the case.
[01:17:34.712 --> 01:17:42.095]  Four-fifths of them on, 72% of them are men, only 15% and 13% women and children.
[01:17:42.575 --> 01:17:44.756]  But Angry Foreigner, your response to the caller?
[01:17:48.158 --> 01:17:50.739]  Well, he didn't ask any question, did he?
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:55.741]  No, I think he was trying to make the distinction between
[01:17:56.608 --> 01:18:03.517]  Moderate and extremist Muslims, but I don't think you can make that distinction between, you know, Shia and Sunni.
[01:18:03.817 --> 01:18:06.821]  I mean, I've got a very good friend that is a Sunni Muslim.
[01:18:07.181 --> 01:18:12.107]  She's by no means an extremist Muslim, so I don't think that's the distinction that we have to make, right?
[01:18:12.928 --> 01:18:13.769]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:17.792]  I don't make a distinction between Shia and Sunni like that.
[01:18:17.853 --> 01:18:25.099]  I make a distinction between moderate Muslims who want to live in a secular society and just various types of fundamentalists and radicals.
[01:18:25.579 --> 01:18:27.481]  The worst kind is Wahhabists.
[01:18:29.202 --> 01:18:34.063]  That's the ideology that Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State is based on.
[01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:38.984]  And, I mean, if you take a moderate Wahhabist, you have the Saudi Arabia.
[01:18:39.044 --> 01:18:47.265]  Like, a moderate Wahhabist isn't gonna cut your head off, but he's gonna sit there and go like, oh, well, yeah, I think it's good if we stone cheating women to death.
[01:18:47.405 --> 01:18:48.545]  Yeah, I think that's reasonable.
[01:18:48.865 --> 01:18:50.846]  Let's have that as a rule.
[01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:52.646]  Like, that's a moderate Wahhabist.
[01:18:53.126 --> 01:18:55.687]  A radical Wahhabist is the Islamic State.
[01:18:55.827 --> 01:18:58.247]  So, I'd rather use those terms instead.
[01:19:00.151 --> 01:19:02.232]  Daniel in Wyoming, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:19:04.112 --> 01:19:06.293]  Hey, uh, what do you call it?
[01:19:06.353 --> 01:19:14.315]  First of all, I wanted to say that you both sound like racists and you should find the nearest minority and gut yourself so they can start feeding on your entrails.
[01:19:16.235 --> 01:19:20.116]  Okay, are you an actual troll or are you being serious right now?
[01:19:21.337 --> 01:19:24.097]  Nah, PJW, I'm just messing around right now.
[01:19:27.139 --> 01:19:49.510]  But what I wanted to ask was, um, the angry foreigner, was we see these like rape statistics about Sweden because I've been seeing this whole Europe Islamization thing happen for a couple of years and I kind of talk about it with people here and I tell them that, you know, if we don't see what's going on over here, you know, this is what's going to happen to us because they're trying to take down the entire middle class.
[01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:53.457]  The white middle class of the world, you know?
[01:19:53.577 --> 01:19:55.782]  Like, there aren't many of us left statistically.
[01:19:55.842 --> 01:19:57.425]  I think the white population is like 7%, but...
[01:19:59.993 --> 01:20:04.414]  But not to get into a little, you know, tribal, you know, brown people versus white people.
[01:20:04.514 --> 01:20:06.115]  All right, we'll get your answer after the break.
[01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:07.335]  This is The Info Wars.

[01:20:41.311 --> 01:20:44.794]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy Report says it's AT&T.

[01:21:09.139 --> 01:21:15.462]  My name is Bill Bonner and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[01:21:15.862 --> 01:21:20.805]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[01:21:21.345 --> 01:21:25.327]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about.
[01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:29.729]  This change has deep implications for life in America.
[01:21:30.170 --> 01:21:34.412]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[01:21:34.992 --> 01:21:37.755]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[01:21:38.135 --> 01:21:40.337]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[01:21:40.357 --> 01:21:45.041]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[01:21:45.502 --> 01:21:46.002]  They did.
[01:21:46.603 --> 01:21:51.027]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[01:21:51.667 --> 01:21:52.087]  They did.
[01:21:52.808 --> 01:21:58.652]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves, but this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[01:21:59.032 --> 01:22:00.213]  This will affect us all.

[01:22:08.826 --> 01:22:12.331]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:13.072 --> 01:22:13.573]  It's true.
[01:22:13.693 --> 01:22:17.639]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:17.839 --> 01:22:19.682]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:20.242 --> 01:22:24.729]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[01:23:38.032 --> 01:23:38.652]  I think so.
[01:24:27.031 --> 01:24:29.393]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show live.
[01:24:29.613 --> 01:24:44.562]  I'm your host Paul Joseph Watts and we're talking to the angry foreigner who is a Bosnian immigrant to Sweden about Sweden's mass immigration policy, their open door policy, in light of this migrant crisis which is currently unfolding.
[01:24:44.942 --> 01:24:50.506]  Before the break we had a caller who brought up the Swedish rape epidemic.
[01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:55.429]  Now this is something that I've wrote about, made videos about on several occasions.
[01:24:56.212 --> 01:25:05.491]  Basically, last year the Swedish Prime Minister unveiled, the new Swedish Prime Minister, the leftist, unveiled what he called a feminist government.
[01:25:05.952 --> 01:25:06.954]  Those were his words.
[01:25:07.867 --> 01:25:18.209]  And yet at the same time, they're importing a deluge of Muslim immigrants, predominantly Muslim immigrants, who treat women as second-class citizens.
[01:25:18.569 --> 01:25:35.812]  But there's a debate over whether this 1,400% increase in rapes since Sweden opened its doors to mass immigration back in the 70s is a result of Sweden expanding its terms for what is defined as rape or
[01:25:36.423 --> 01:25:52.017]  If it's purely due to the fact that they've got these waves of Muslims emigrating to the country who do treat women as second-class citizens, who are inclined, as part of their culture, as treating women as inferior, to rape more women.
[01:25:52.277 --> 01:26:01.726]  Now if you look at the situation in the migrant camps in Germany, a number of women's organizations in Germany have raised the alarm to the fact that
[01:26:02.521 --> 01:26:15.975]  Children and women are being raped in these migrant camps and the media and the police authorities in Germany are covering up the details of those incidents for months so as to not
[01:26:16.877 --> 01:26:28.327]  Give legitimacy, and these were their own words, so not give legitimacy to quote right-wing protesters who are anti-immigration, who are anti this mass migrant wave.
[01:26:28.907 --> 01:26:34.712]  So the angry foreigner, the caller brought up the point of this rape epidemic in Sweden.
[01:26:35.033 --> 01:26:38.676]  People are now calling Sweden the rape capital of Europe.
[01:26:39.296 --> 01:26:40.878]  What is the truth between
[01:26:41.661 --> 01:26:59.673]  The left, who argue that it's only increased to such an extent because they've redefined the terms, compared to the right, which points out the fact that, you know, 72% of these perpetrators are identified as foreigners, that this is part of this male Muslim culture.
[01:26:59.713 --> 01:27:03.736]  What is the truth in that distinction with this 1,400% rape increase in Sweden?
[01:27:07.694 --> 01:27:08.955]  Well, both have a point.
[01:27:09.075 --> 01:27:15.300]  I mean, it is true that Sweden has a very generous definition of rape and also a generous way of counting statistics.
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:23.026]  For example, if a woman is raped 300 times by the same man, we will count that as 300 rapes instead of one rape, which they will do in other countries.
[01:27:23.066 --> 01:27:25.988]  So you can't actually compare rape statistics internationally.
[01:27:26.368 --> 01:27:30.091]  But it is also true that immigrants are overrepresented when it comes to rape.
[01:27:30.371 --> 01:27:37.297]  For example, if you look at the court verdicts from 2010, little more than half of all the rapes were done by immigrants.
[01:27:37.737 --> 01:27:43.021]  And that is absurd, considering that 15% of our population is born outside of Sweden.
[01:27:43.622 --> 01:27:54.810]  If you count immigrants and their children, if you count second generation, like, for instance, children who have at least one parent who is an immigrant who is born outside of Sweden, then the immigrant population becomes 30%.
[01:27:56.371 --> 01:28:03.956]  So to think that you have a minority of 30% who are responsible for more than half the rapes in the country is pretty absurd.
[01:28:04.076 --> 01:28:07.959]  So there is... Both sides have some truth to them, I would say.
[01:28:10.521 --> 01:28:15.625]  So, you know, they try and extend this definition of rape.
[01:28:15.665 --> 01:28:25.733]  I mean, we had a story on Infowars.com a couple of weeks ago where in American colleges calling someone a slut is defined as an act of sexual violence.
[01:28:26.253 --> 01:28:29.216]  And, you know, the left in many cases will use that to
[01:28:30.086 --> 01:28:44.894]  impugn, you know, college goers in America as all would-be potential rapists, but then they use the same expanded definition to kind of absolve the blame when it comes to Muslim migrant rape in Sweden.
[01:28:45.413 --> 01:29:00.003]  So again, it's passing the terms on the fact that they introduced these expanded definitions, but then they use them in different contexts to either blame, in one case, or absolve people of rape.
[01:29:00.483 --> 01:29:15.013]  So it's an interesting conundrum, but as you said, the simple mathematics of it, and again, I know facts are racist, you know, God forbid I would bring up facts and mathematics, but the Muslim population, the migrant population in Sweden,
[01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:24.493]  The fact that they're responsible for over 50% of rapes, as you said, compared to their population suggests that there is a problem, right?
[01:29:24.814 --> 01:29:26.794]  I wouldn't necessarily say that they're Muslims.
[01:29:27.134 --> 01:29:28.715]  I have no idea what religion they are.
[01:29:28.755 --> 01:29:34.657]  But there are... Certain countries are over-represented in Africa and the Middle East.
[01:29:34.977 --> 01:29:36.797]  So, I would put it like that.
[01:29:36.817 --> 01:29:39.738]  They're predominantly Muslim, right?
[01:29:40.038 --> 01:29:42.379]  I mean, we gotta say they're predominantly Muslim.
[01:29:42.992 --> 01:29:44.213]  Because that's in their culture.
[01:29:44.873 --> 01:29:48.255]  Do you mean that they're Arabs or that they're practicing Muslims?
[01:29:49.255 --> 01:29:59.080]  No, that they're practicing Muslims and that it is within... Right, well I have no idea because there's no statistics about that, so... Okay, we'll be back after the break with the Angry Foreigner morning report coming up.
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.561]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.502 --> 01:30:05.183]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:16.483]  A Georgia high school went into lockdown the other day after a student showed up with a confederate flag.
[01:30:16.923 --> 01:30:25.067]  The incident started when a 10th grade boy arrived at Rock Mart High School with the rebel flag attached to his backpack.
[01:30:25.407 --> 01:30:31.310]  He was then confronted by two black students who were upset by the flag and a fight broke out.
[01:30:34.611 --> 01:30:38.154]  The scuffle was quickly broken up by teachers and staff.
[01:30:38.554 --> 01:30:41.917]  All three students were searched and no weapons were found.
[01:30:42.217 --> 01:30:51.145]  But then rumors began to circulate that more students would be bringing Confederate flags to school and a campus lockdown was ordered.
[01:30:51.645 --> 01:30:57.030]  No word as to whether or not the black students are equally upset with President Barack Obama.
[01:30:57.230 --> 01:31:02.493]  Who also displayed the Confederate flag on his own campaign pin in 2012.

[01:33:26.274 --> 01:33:30.198]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:31.779 --> 01:33:36.503]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:52.186]  I'm Paul Joseph Cox filling in for Alex Jones and we're talking to the angry foreigner who, bear in mind, describes himself as a leftist, so don't be fooled by the name.
[01:33:52.646 --> 01:34:03.412]  He is a classical liberal, but he's faced some flak, as anyone would, in Sweden for opposing the policy of mass immigration.
[01:34:03.432 --> 01:34:07.494]  We're going to go some more of your calls in a second, but first I wanted to ask you,
[01:34:08.547 --> 01:34:17.219]  The Sweden Democrats, which are, as far as I know, considered conservative, considered right-wing in Sweden, they're currently surging in the polls.
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:25.030]  So whereas we get this portrayal of Sweden as this, you know, liberal, extremist liberal, even backwater,
[01:34:25.726 --> 01:34:33.473]  The conservative opposition to these mass immigration policies are currently enjoying significant success in the polls.
[01:34:33.993 --> 01:34:39.998]  So is there likely to be a legitimate backlash against this with people voting out the government?
[01:34:40.639 --> 01:34:48.265]  Or is, as you mentioned before, the peer pressure, the social taboo of opposing this likely to hold sway?
[01:34:48.305 --> 01:34:53.910]  Or is there going to be a conservative backlash against these immigration policies in Sweden?
[01:34:55.043 --> 01:35:01.426]  The Sweden Democrats are social conservatives, and I believe that they will become the biggest party in the future.
[01:35:02.086 --> 01:35:07.469]  Because, you know, you don't have to say what party you vote for, so the peer pressure doesn't really apply there.
[01:35:07.969 --> 01:35:10.130]  And I definitely think it's some kind of backlash.
[01:35:10.170 --> 01:35:13.292]  I mean, people are tired of multiculturalism.
[01:35:13.372 --> 01:35:16.393]  Nobody's against influences from other cultures.
[01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:23.262]  You know, taking a foreign aspect of a different culture and incorporating it into your own.
[01:35:24.002 --> 01:35:24.722]  People like that.
[01:35:24.782 --> 01:35:26.963]  That's why we have meatballs in Sweden.
[01:35:26.983 --> 01:35:27.723]  That's why you have pizza.
[01:35:27.743 --> 01:35:28.503]  So that's not a problem.
[01:35:28.523 --> 01:35:29.964]  But that's not multiculturalism.
[01:35:30.044 --> 01:35:31.324]  That doesn't even have a name.
[01:35:31.404 --> 01:35:33.305]  I mean, that's just what happens in reality.
[01:35:33.385 --> 01:35:34.925]  Cultures evolve through time.
[01:35:35.246 --> 01:35:39.427]  Multiculturalism is engineered by politicians and forced onto the people.
[01:35:39.447 --> 01:35:40.567]  I have a perfect example of that.
[01:35:40.907 --> 01:35:45.629]  We have a debate show here on public service media.
[01:35:46.329 --> 01:35:48.370]  Every week they do an episode
[01:35:48.510 --> 01:36:13.089]  about current events and a while back we had we actually had people discuss on primetime television whether or not we should allow gender segregated bath halls in the name of Allah because there were these Muslim, Arab and African women sitting there saying that oh we can't bathe in the presence of men that's against our culture that's against our religion and it's like if you need to have an argument about it if you need to discuss
[01:36:13.909 --> 01:36:17.592]  Whether we should have a change towards this direction, that's not natural.
[01:36:18.053 --> 01:36:20.415]  That is forced by someone else.
[01:36:21.015 --> 01:36:25.539]  And we've had several cases over the years where Muslims show up to their workplace.
[01:36:25.559 --> 01:36:27.040]  These are fundamentalists, not moderates.
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:33.826]  They show up to their workplace and they refuse to shake hands with female co-workers or even their boss, because she's a woman.
[01:36:34.326 --> 01:36:39.130]  And the employer tells them that they need to adapt, they need to shake hands, they need to be able to greet people.
[01:36:39.591 --> 01:36:40.732]  But the Muslims get offended.
[01:36:41.192 --> 01:36:55.838]  So they sue them for discrimination and get thousands of crowns in damages because the court's reasoning is that in a multicultural society, you need to be able to greet in more than one way.
[01:36:56.259 --> 01:36:57.079]  And that's ridiculous.
[01:36:57.119 --> 01:36:58.740]  I mean, most people think that's ridiculous.
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:03.582]  Most people think that you should adapt to the country that you come to because that's just common sense.
[01:37:03.622 --> 01:37:04.542]  That's common courtesy.
[01:37:05.243 --> 01:37:06.603]  And most people want to live in Sweden.
[01:37:06.623 --> 01:37:08.004]  They don't want to live in Afghanistan.
[01:37:08.863 --> 01:37:11.487]  So yeah, I think definitely it's a backlash.
[01:37:11.507 --> 01:37:14.852]  I mean, we're accepting way more immigrants than we can handle.
[01:37:16.094 --> 01:37:18.397]  When I got here in 1990, there was three ghettos in Sweden.
[01:37:18.517 --> 01:37:19.318]  In 2012, there were 186.
[01:37:24.165 --> 01:37:27.166]  Our society has not been going towards a good direction.
[01:37:27.566 --> 01:37:30.446]  We're taking people in, but we're not taking care of them.
[01:37:30.586 --> 01:37:38.268]  Our system is guaranteed to put people into segregation and guaranteed to cause bad integration.
[01:37:38.608 --> 01:37:45.170]  Because you can't have a massive immigration the size of ours and then expect people to mix together.
[01:37:45.190 --> 01:37:46.230]  What's going to happen is that
[01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:51.072]  They're gonna end up in these areas where there's cheap housing, and they're gonna stay in those areas.
[01:37:51.533 --> 01:38:00.637]  And they're not gonna have a reason to learn Swedish, because there's mostly immigrants in that area, and Swedish is not a natural part of your everyday life in that neighborhood.
[01:38:00.917 --> 01:38:03.118]  People go around certain areas just talking Arab.
[01:38:03.659 --> 01:38:06.060]  So, obviously, things have failed.
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:14.026]  Yeah, I mean even Merkel and Cameron admitted that a few years ago, that multiculturalism has failed.
[01:38:14.427 --> 01:38:20.073]  Because it's not about gradual migration, as you said, I think, in one of your videos.
[01:38:20.598 --> 01:38:27.604]  If we accepted these people, if we had time to assimilate them in relatively low numbers, then it could be a success.
[01:38:27.964 --> 01:38:39.313]  We could embrace the positive aspects of their culture, we could embrace, you know, the diversity that is positive, the food, for example, as you mentioned, but that's not what's happening.
[01:38:39.333 --> 01:38:50.082]  It's a wave and these people are not assimilating, they're not speaking the language, large numbers of them, and they're actually causing problems for the immigrants who do make the effort
[01:38:50.683 --> 01:38:54.964]  To learn the language, to integrate, to get jobs, as you have done.
[01:38:55.564 --> 01:38:57.324]  And so that's part of the problem.
[01:38:57.845 --> 01:39:04.706]  But why do you think that European governments, and especially Germany and Sweden, are basically rolling out the red carpet?
[01:39:05.166 --> 01:39:09.287]  Surely it's not because of their humanitarian virtues, right?
[01:39:09.307 --> 01:39:17.209]  There must be a larger political agenda as to why they're allowing these migrants to flood the country in such large numbers.
[01:39:18.706 --> 01:39:25.914]  Yeah, I don't know why there are certain theories, but I absolutely do not believe this has anything to do with humanitarianism.
[01:39:26.235 --> 01:39:30.760]  Because I mean, if you look at it, the majority of refugees are stuck in the Middle East.
[01:39:32.041 --> 01:39:33.603]  There's like, it's
[01:39:34.404 --> 01:39:39.868]  5% of all refugees that manage to come to Sweden and those are the ones that have the money to smuggle themselves north.
[01:39:40.168 --> 01:39:45.432]  So you're not helping the most amount of people by accepting like 5% of people.
[01:39:45.892 --> 01:39:47.013]  So there's something else to it.
[01:39:47.474 --> 01:39:50.696]  Germany, I've been told, needs cheap labor.
[01:39:50.996 --> 01:39:55.440]  So basically they're importing workforce right now, according to my understanding.
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:58.322]  Sweden, on the other hand, is a bit weirder.
[01:39:58.362 --> 01:39:59.282]  I don't understand that.
[01:39:59.503 --> 01:40:05.947]  I've heard politicians say that, oh, well, in the future, we need people who can take care of our elderly.
[01:40:06.407 --> 01:40:14.773]  So they think that they're importing workforce when statistics show that, you know, 80% of Somalians don't have jobs.
[01:40:15.677 --> 01:40:16.839]  Well that's what I was going to say.
[01:40:16.859 --> 01:40:23.150]  The figures that I read, 58% of welfare payments in Sweden go to immigrants.
[01:40:23.290 --> 01:40:29.541]  So it's not as if they're filling jobs that Swedes don't want to do because they're getting most of the welfare payments.
[01:40:31.062 --> 01:40:35.384]  And after seven years, around half of immigrants don't have jobs.
[01:40:35.524 --> 01:40:39.046]  So the integration into the work market is terrible.
[01:40:39.406 --> 01:40:42.167]  Like, I have no idea what's going on here.
[01:40:42.407 --> 01:40:45.389]  I heard another theory, which was quite interesting, is that
[01:40:46.890 --> 01:40:52.495]  And I'm very bad at economics, so I can't investigate this really.
[01:40:52.535 --> 01:40:59.683]  But the guy was basically saying that importing a massive amount of people like this is a way to avoid a financial collapse.
[01:41:00.283 --> 01:41:05.328]  Because you're basically trying to... You're importing people that you can put into debt.
[01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:09.750]  So you can avoid inflation or something to that extent.
[01:41:11.151 --> 01:41:19.094]  There's a number of theories, but I absolutely do not think that these psychopaths in our Parliament are being nice.
[01:41:19.594 --> 01:41:21.095]  That's the last thing I would guess.
[01:41:22.776 --> 01:41:26.197]  TJ in Minnesota, you're on the air with the Angry Foreigner.
[01:41:26.297 --> 01:41:27.058]  TJ, go ahead.
[01:41:28.418 --> 01:41:28.878]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:28.918 --> 01:41:30.279]  Brother British Watson.
[01:41:31.539 --> 01:41:33.040]  And Mr. Sweden there.
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:48.407]  I would like to give you my credentials in the Middle East that were high enough for diplomatic immunity in the 1990s, but I'm not going to do that because your call receiver said I have to form it into a question.
[01:41:49.288 --> 01:41:54.630]  But I think both of you gentlemen are headed for a 10x target bullseye.
[01:41:55.751 --> 01:41:59.173]  And I know that there are three monotheistic religions.
[01:42:00.513 --> 01:42:03.395]  Islam, Christianity, and
[01:42:04.033 --> 01:42:04.874]  Jewish faith.
[01:42:05.654 --> 01:42:08.056]  And they better hang together or hang separately.
[01:42:08.076 --> 01:42:19.803]  And I know, I know much about the prayerfulness and the God-fearingness of true Muslim leaders of many Middle East countries.
[01:42:21.064 --> 01:42:22.205]  Well, I have a question.
[01:42:23.245 --> 01:42:27.668]  And the question is this, and it only formed at noon today.
[01:42:28.689 --> 01:42:33.412]  Putin, nobody hates Nazis like the Russians.
[01:42:34.654 --> 01:42:48.403]  And apparently, according to mainstream propagandist news, I want, I don't know if you've heard it yet, but he's taken out by aircraft and whatever right now in Syria.
[01:42:49.083 --> 01:42:51.265]  He's taken out LCIA.
[01:42:52.185 --> 01:43:02.512]  He's taking out ISIS, ISIL and whatever form you want to put that UN US diabolical demon
[01:43:04.582 --> 01:43:12.493]  Yeah, we posted that up on Infowars.com earlier.
[01:43:13.174 --> 01:43:19.743]  Russia has begun airstrikes in Syria against ISIS targets and of course, for three years,
[01:43:20.762 --> 01:43:34.114]  The Obama administration has been arming these, quote, moderate rebels in Syria, who in many cases go on to hand their weapons over to ISIS, in other cases defect to ISIS.
[01:43:34.554 --> 01:43:46.184]  But then Russia and Putin, he's suddenly the bad guy for actually wanting to move tanks, wanting to fly aircraft over Syria to actually target these ISIS terrorists.
[01:43:47.065 --> 01:43:48.046]  Then you have Turkey,
[01:43:49.085 --> 01:43:52.927]  I suppose it's allies bombing the Kurds who are fighting ISIS.
[01:43:53.288 --> 01:44:01.532]  You have Saudi Arabia coming out and saying that they're going to threaten the military option in Syria unless Assad steps down.
[01:44:02.073 --> 01:44:05.815]  Again, siding with ISIS, they want to overthrow Assad.
[01:44:06.435 --> 01:44:15.821]  And this was the very origin, this was the very cause of the migrant crisis in the first place, which is now impacting Germany and Sweden.
[01:44:15.861 --> 01:44:17.502]  The Angry Foreigner, your comments on that?
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:37.045]  Yeah, that's something that really annoys me about the whole debate, especially in the media and the political debate, is that everybody's talking about right now, we need to take in a bunch of refugees right now, when nobody's talking about why these people are running to begin with, like what caused this crisis.
[01:44:37.945 --> 01:44:40.248]  It's basically irresponsible politics.
[01:44:40.408 --> 01:44:43.071]  It's us voting for politicians that contribute to wars.
[01:44:43.091 --> 01:44:48.176]  You know, Sweden's government has also financially supported terrorists.
[01:44:48.236 --> 01:44:51.720]  I mean, we supported Al-Qaeda allies.
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:58.887]  The Syrian Recovery Trust Fund are allied with Al-Qaeda, tactically allied, and we gave them several millions.
[01:44:59.768 --> 01:45:13.355]  So, you know, I think it's short-sighted and one-sided that nobody's thinking about the future, like how we're going to take care of these people, and nobody's thinking of, well, how did we get to this situation?
[01:45:13.875 --> 01:45:14.275]  The past.
[01:45:14.635 --> 01:45:17.977]  They're just thinking right now we need to import people.
[01:45:18.537 --> 01:45:20.518]  And that's really bad.
[01:45:20.558 --> 01:45:23.500]  There is no nuance whatsoever in the public debate.
[01:45:25.876 --> 01:45:39.509]  Okay, we've got another guest coming up, but Angry Foreigner, I just wanted to give you the opportunity here in the final few minutes to tell people about your YouTube channel, how they can subscribe to that, how they can get further information about your videos.
[01:45:41.041 --> 01:45:45.485]  Yeah, well just go on YouTube and type in Angry Foreigner and you're going to see my channel.
[01:45:46.506 --> 01:45:47.847]  And just click subscribe.
[01:45:47.907 --> 01:45:50.449]  I'm going to be making a lot more English videos.
[01:45:50.469 --> 01:45:52.811]  My next video is going to be pretty long, 15 minutes.
[01:45:52.871 --> 01:45:54.973]  It's going to be about the Islamization of Sweden.
[01:45:55.793 --> 01:46:03.700]  And I also got a video coming tomorrow about how we choose to keep rapists but deport people, immigrants, who actually have a job.
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:06.222]  So, there's a lot to look forward to.
[01:46:08.499 --> 01:46:09.820]  Okay, The Angry Foreigner.
[01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:12.102]  Thanks for joining us on The Alex Jones Show.

[01:46:15.644 --> 01:46:16.445]  Thanks for being with us.
[01:46:17.105 --> 01:46:17.565]  Thanks, man.
[01:46:18.326 --> 01:46:18.686]  Thank you.
[01:46:19.607 --> 01:46:21.068]  Okay, there goes The Angry Foreigner.
[01:46:21.488 --> 01:46:23.549]  We're gonna switch now to our next guest.
[01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:25.971]  Again, fascinating topic.
[01:46:26.031 --> 01:46:30.114]  It's not one that we've explored that deeply here on the radio show.
[01:46:30.154 --> 01:46:31.595]  I've made a few videos about it.
[01:46:32.489 --> 01:46:44.133]  But that topic is Gamergate, and this is the use of video games, the hijacking of the video game industry for purposes of brainwashing and re-education.
[01:46:44.753 --> 01:46:56.517]  And we've got a guest, Theodore Morgan Major, who is a researcher with SEAL Team 6, which is a research team focused on the gaming industry and the Gamergate controversy.
[01:46:56.597 --> 01:46:57.938]  Theodore, welcome to the show.
[01:47:00.899 --> 01:47:01.919]  We've not got Theodore yet.
[01:47:03.203 --> 01:47:08.285]  Okay, so we're going to talk to Theodore in a second, but I've made videos about this.
[01:47:08.345 --> 01:47:10.526]  Again, it's quite a technical subject.
[01:47:11.086 --> 01:47:29.234]  Gamergate is how people within the gaming industry, basically social justice warriors, extreme left-wingers, came to the conclusion, and this is backed up by the evidence, yesterday we saw a poll, trust in mainstream media has dropped, has plummeted to an all-time low.
[01:47:29.918 --> 01:47:33.201]  So people don't believe what they see on mainstream news.
[01:47:33.561 --> 01:47:35.863]  People don't believe what they see in Hollywood.
[01:47:36.303 --> 01:47:40.286]  We had propaganda placement in Hollywood for decades.
[01:47:40.746 --> 01:47:42.628]  Now people have got wise to that.
[01:47:43.308 --> 01:47:49.373]  These social engineers, and that's what it is, it's a program of social engineering, it's a program of re-education.
[01:47:49.833 --> 01:47:57.459]  They've abandoned these traditional media outlets, which are failing in terms of their influence, in terms of their reach.
[01:47:58.067 --> 01:48:16.919]  Of course, if the mainstream media gets together and decides we're going to coalesce around this common narrative around a certain issue, for example, you know, the migrant invasion is a humanitarian benefit for Europe, then the power of those mainstream media outlets combined is still a force to be reckoned with.
[01:48:17.850 --> 01:48:32.578]  But if it's completely, you know, diluted, they don't have individual power, so they have to resort to other outlets to have that social engineering impact, because more and more people are tuning out of the mainstream media.
[01:48:32.878 --> 01:48:39.221]  I'm going to go to our guest now, who is a researcher into the Gamergate controversy, Theodore Morgan Major.
[01:48:39.241 --> 01:48:40.022]  Welcome to the show.
[01:48:40.922 --> 01:48:42.543]  Nice to have you aboard.
[01:48:44.244 --> 01:48:45.225]  Now, let's just sum up.
[01:48:46.061 --> 01:48:47.022]  Gamergate, okay.
[01:48:47.722 --> 01:48:48.643]  What's Gamergate?
[01:48:48.843 --> 01:48:49.844]  Why does it matter?
[01:48:49.924 --> 01:48:51.245]  Why should people care?
[01:48:51.265 --> 01:48:52.346]  In two minutes, go ahead.
[01:48:53.307 --> 01:48:57.530]  Gamergate is an ongoing event set with various groups competing against each other.
[01:48:57.550 --> 01:49:03.395]  One group, you have people that are interested in ethics and games journalism, which most are aware of.
[01:49:03.775 --> 01:49:09.580]  You have one group that are the Stock Justice loonies that have been trying to push their far-left agenda onto games.
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:10.781]  That's another obvious one.
[01:49:11.201 --> 01:49:18.265]  Another one are some of the ones that are not far-left loonies that are sick and tired of said far-left loonies and have ended up siding with GamerGates.
[01:49:19.146 --> 01:49:21.307]  Then, of course, there's trolls messing with both sides of the field.
[01:49:21.467 --> 01:49:23.188]  It's a bit of a complete mess.
[01:49:23.548 --> 01:49:28.131]  If you really wanted to try and cover it, it would be more akin to trying to cover a bloody war.
[01:49:29.211 --> 01:49:30.012]  An information war.
[01:49:31.032 --> 01:49:34.734]  People end up trying to bring it to something else, but that's what I think it is.
[01:49:36.475 --> 01:49:39.037]  And this basically arose out of the fact that
[01:49:39.781 --> 01:49:48.746]  The gaming media, or elements of the gaming media, around a year ago, or just over a year ago, basically came out and said that gaming was dead.
[01:49:49.106 --> 01:49:55.369]  And bear in mind again, gaming is the most profitable entertainment industry in America right now.
[01:49:55.429 --> 01:49:56.730]  It surpasses movies.
[01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:58.611]  It surpasses anything else.
[01:49:59.031 --> 01:50:01.493]  So they came out and declared that that was dead.
[01:50:01.553 --> 01:50:09.237]  They need to hijack that for social engineering and bring it to a point where games, video games, are used for
[01:50:09.929 --> 01:50:10.889]  You know, conditioning.
[01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:14.831]  And we'll get into what kind of conditioning they want after the break.
[01:50:15.252 --> 01:50:16.792]  We're going to go to our guest after the break.
[01:50:17.193 --> 01:50:20.734]  Again, taking your calls here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:20.754 --> 01:50:22.875]  We'll get the number for you in a moment.
[01:50:22.916 --> 01:50:23.736]  But we're talking to
[01:50:24.511 --> 01:50:27.393]  Theodore Morgan Major, now he's a researcher with SEAL Team 6.
[01:50:27.774 --> 01:50:32.137]  This is an organisation that has delved into the Gamergate controversy.
[01:50:32.477 --> 01:50:38.962]  They've connected the dots, not only with the agenda, which is to use video games for social re-education.
[01:50:39.462 --> 01:50:40.283]  And again, people say...
[01:50:41.266 --> 01:50:43.048]  Feminists have no power, just ignore them.
[01:50:43.069 --> 01:50:45.211]  You know, they have no influence whatsoever.
[01:50:45.572 --> 01:50:52.261]  This is a key industry in which they are implementing their influence amongst the next generation.
[01:50:52.301 --> 01:50:52.822]  This is key.
[01:50:52.862 --> 01:50:55.205]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show after the break.
[01:50:55.225 --> 01:50:55.886]  Stay tuned.
[01:51:09.633 --> 01:51:13.494]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:13.534 --> 01:51:16.434]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:16.614 --> 01:51:17.895]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:18.155 --> 01:51:21.135]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:21.395 --> 01:51:22.296]  Infidel Body Armor.

[01:52:10.501 --> 01:52:18.244]  Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day and the home security industry wants you to believe that's your only option.
[01:52:18.504 --> 01:52:23.687]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[01:52:23.987 --> 01:52:28.589]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[01:52:28.889 --> 01:52:32.110]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.
[01:52:32.410 --> 01:52:34.471]  But there's a better way to protect your home.

[01:54:25.936 --> 01:54:29.300]  We're back live, it's the Alex Jones Show with your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:54:29.981 --> 01:54:32.584]  Top story on m4wars.com right now, Kurt Nimmo.
[01:54:33.125 --> 01:54:37.030]  New York Times begins propaganda campaign against Russian airstrikes.
[01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:42.016]  That's right, actually trying to kill frigging ISIS terrorists.
[01:54:42.256 --> 01:54:43.037]  That's bad!
[01:54:43.497 --> 01:54:53.082]  No, we should arm the Syrian rebels, the so-called moderate rebels, who are giving their weapons to ISIS, who are defecting to ISIS.
[01:54:53.463 --> 01:55:04.529]  So the New York Times on the day that Russia announces that it's trying to airstrike and actually kill ISIS militants, what the Obama administration has failed to do for over a year,
[01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:21.019]  They're now basically saying that that's wrong because they haven't targeted the right area, even though they're trying to defend this strategic air base, which is fundamental to the survival of the Syrian government, which is taking on ISIS.
[01:55:21.379 --> 01:55:31.785]  Again, illustrating the point that the Obama administration, that the mainstream media, in the guise of the New York Times, doesn't want ISIS to be eliminated because
[01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:47.783]  They're basically in support of Assad being overthrown, and that has been the case for two, three, four years, supporting Al-Qaeda-linked rebels who have defected and given their weapons to ISIS.
[01:55:48.304 --> 01:55:56.632]  So, Putin's bad for trying to kill ISIS, Obama's good for arming rebels who give their weapons to ISIS.
[01:55:56.972 --> 01:56:01.557]  That's a narrative that the New York Times is trying to make us swallow right now.
[01:56:01.938 --> 01:56:07.844]  But we're talking about Gamergate with Theodore Morgan Major, who is a researcher with SEAL Team 6.
[01:56:08.885 --> 01:56:13.710]  Now Theodore, you wrote this PDF file which basically outlines the case.
[01:56:14.511 --> 01:56:29.461]  To summarize the findings, and I quote from the PDF file, the purpose of declaring gamers dead, and this is what we discussed before the break, and to normalize gaming among society was to change public perception to allow lobbying efforts down the line to succeed.
[01:56:29.781 --> 01:56:37.707]  As it turns out, games are to be repurposed as learning aids and eventually used as the primary tool of indoctrination
[01:56:38.442 --> 01:56:39.603]  In schools.
[01:56:39.963 --> 01:56:50.431]  So explain why they're repurposing video games as re-education tools for the public while television news, while Hollywood films decline in influence.
[01:56:52.205 --> 01:56:55.768]  Because the gaming media currently is in a bubble.
[01:56:56.389 --> 01:56:57.770]  It's built on a lot of hype.
[01:56:58.471 --> 01:57:03.555]  It's built on a lot of things that are going to come crashing down in the upcoming years.
[01:57:04.296 --> 01:57:08.519]  The problem that they're facing is they need to be able to reach a new audience.
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:10.721]  And what they're going to try and do
[01:57:12.117 --> 01:57:16.301]  is they're going to try and reach out to EdTech, which they've been doing for a while.
[01:57:16.341 --> 01:57:18.863]  They're going to try and reach out to the defense.
[01:57:18.903 --> 01:57:20.144]  They've done that a little bit too.
[01:57:20.764 --> 01:57:25.729]  But the reason they're doing this is because they're selling it to make money.
[01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:28.011]  That's the primary goal of these.
[01:57:28.251 --> 01:57:32.574]  A secondary goal is a lot of them are here this ideology to begin with.
[01:57:33.395 --> 01:57:40.001]  This progressive ideology that just just so happens to support other interests.
[01:57:41.809 --> 01:57:42.689]  It's multiple groups.
[01:57:42.990 --> 01:57:50.052]  One of them is basically Microsoft and that particular crew.
[01:57:50.532 --> 01:57:58.794]  They've been putting a lot of money in with certain interest groups to promote this particular bit.
[01:57:59.074 --> 01:58:01.435]  Man, I'm doing bad at this.
[01:58:01.495 --> 01:58:01.915]  I'm sorry.
[01:58:06.044 --> 01:58:09.185]  What examples of social engineering are they pushing?
[01:58:09.545 --> 01:58:16.908]  From my perspective it seems like video games are really successful right now as merely a form of entertainment, right?
[01:58:17.309 --> 01:58:21.250]  It's the biggest grossing entertainment industry in America right now.
[01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:30.394]  So why the need financially to hand this over to these groups who are only interested in pushing their political agenda?
[01:58:30.894 --> 01:58:34.517]  When it seems like the gaming industry in general doesn't need them.
[01:58:34.677 --> 01:58:36.699]  They're pretty successful without them, right?
[01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:38.520]  They are.
[01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:41.683]  Last I checked, it was around a $90 billion a year industry.
[01:58:43.044 --> 01:58:44.565]  Yeah, and we'll talk about that after the break.
[01:58:44.585 --> 01:58:45.986]  We're going to take callers as well.
[01:58:46.046 --> 01:58:47.668]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.

[02:00:15.134 --> 02:00:15.775]  Big Brother.
[02:00:16.455 --> 02:00:17.476]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:18.217 --> 02:00:19.318]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:19.978 --> 02:00:20.779]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.559 --> 02:00:22.440]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.101 --> 02:00:26.764]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.304 --> 02:00:31.368]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.932 --> 02:00:43.036]  It's Paul DeFossum, back live with the Alex Jones Show this Wednesday, September 30th edition.
[02:00:43.076 --> 02:00:53.001]  We're talking to Theodore Morgan Major, who is a researcher with SEAL Team 6, a research team focused on the gaming industry and the Gamergate controversy.
[02:00:53.441 --> 02:00:55.963]  If you don't know about Gamergate, it's basically been...
[02:00:56.946 --> 02:00:58.707]  Raging for over a year.
[02:00:59.268 --> 02:01:08.534]  This is an example of how social justice warriors and left-wing activists have hid their agenda behind other guises.
[02:01:09.135 --> 02:01:13.978]  So again, you know, television news, Hollywood, we've had propaganda placement
[02:01:14.801 --> 02:01:20.224]  For decades, in those two industries, it's not as successful as it once was.
[02:01:20.284 --> 02:01:21.604]  In fact, we've got the polls.
[02:01:22.004 --> 02:01:25.486]  Trust in mainstream media is at a record low.
[02:01:25.946 --> 02:01:27.707]  So people are no longer believing
[02:01:28.658 --> 02:01:38.046]  What they see on the television news, they're no longer believing the narratives that they see within Hollywood movie scripts, within television scripts.
[02:01:38.486 --> 02:01:46.093]  Some people would argue that, you know, Americans love to be lied to, that it doesn't even matter whether trust is at an all-time low or not.
[02:01:46.793 --> 02:01:59.122]  But this has caused consternation amongst the social engineers, amongst the control freaks, because their audience is declining in those genres and they're becoming less trustworthy.
[02:01:59.462 --> 02:02:09.650]  So now they've moved into different genres, different industries, to try and maintain and uphold that social engineering in terms of
[02:02:10.404 --> 02:02:18.566]  You know, social justice warrior, left-wing narratives that they need to uphold to continue and prolong their power.
[02:02:19.006 --> 02:02:23.548]  That's basically what it centers around, and Gamergate is a perfect example of this.
[02:02:24.048 --> 02:02:35.371]  This is how left-wing activists and feminists have seized control of an industry which should be based around consumer demand and entertainment, and they've turned it into this
[02:02:36.011 --> 02:02:38.353]  Basically a platform for re-education.
[02:02:38.713 --> 02:02:39.753]  And that's insidious.
[02:02:40.114 --> 02:02:41.575]  That's North Korea-like.
[02:02:41.975 --> 02:02:47.178]  We shouldn't have people with political agendas involved in entertainment.
[02:02:47.558 --> 02:02:55.443]  If it's completely open source and they, you know, admittedly, you know, display that to the full public view, then that's fine.
[02:02:55.463 --> 02:03:04.809]  But when they're doing it behind the scenes, when they're hiding it behind this supposedly neutral platform, then it becomes a major problem and we need to talk about it.
[02:03:05.529 --> 02:03:12.716]  So Theodore Morgan Major, just describe how they're using video games for political re-engineering.
[02:03:12.976 --> 02:03:20.263]  What messages are they putting within these video games to push their political agenda, and why should we be concerned about that?
[02:03:24.387 --> 02:03:26.950]  Specifically, they are citing their own work.
[02:03:27.651 --> 02:03:29.692]  They are pushing together into groups.
[02:03:36.089 --> 02:03:50.815]  They have been engaged in Cytogenesis, which is basically citing each other's work, which ends up eventually getting fed to Wikipedia as people end up knowing how Wikipedia works, ends up taking citations from supposedly credible sources.
[02:03:51.855 --> 02:04:01.239]  Anyways, they've been building up their cases from there to get government money, to produce papers, to give them more authority.
[02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:02.660]  They've been
[02:04:06.792 --> 02:04:10.275]  Producing lackluster games and getting government money for that.
[02:04:10.836 --> 02:04:18.743]  A notable example for that one would be what led up to a game called Depression Quest.
[02:04:19.283 --> 02:04:21.385]  And that was Zoe Quinn, right?
[02:04:21.405 --> 02:04:25.289]  That was the same woman that got in front of the UN and basically said,
[02:04:25.928 --> 02:04:35.696]  That calling someone via their pre-transition name a transgender person is the equivalent of a hate crime or cyber violence.
[02:04:35.736 --> 02:04:48.087]  So if you get up on Twitter and call Caitlyn Jenner Bruce, then you're committing an act of cyber violence and they're literally now calling for the UN to censor these people.
[02:04:49.404 --> 02:04:51.726]  Oh yeah, it's getting bloody ridiculous.
[02:04:52.407 --> 02:04:56.790]  Of course, a lot of people earlier on were saying, oh, she's not relevant, she's not relevant.
[02:04:57.151 --> 02:05:05.238]  Problem is, she's a part of a little fat group that was called Feminist in Games and started a little thing called Danes Making Games, which is...
[02:05:06.502 --> 02:05:09.827]  Okay, well, we're back with Theodore Morgan, Major, on the Alex Jones Show live.
[02:05:23.226 --> 02:05:25.928]  And that's according to a statement issued by the Endocrine Society.
[02:05:26.088 --> 02:05:35.754]  The statement builds upon the Society's groundbreaking 2009 report, which examines the state of scientific evidence on endocrine-disrupting chemicals, or EDCs, and the risk posed to human health.
[02:05:36.014 --> 02:05:41.878]  I made a search using two words, InfoWars and BPA, and was astounded by the number of times we've covered this subject.
[02:05:41.958 --> 02:05:49.803]  Mounting evidence also indicates that EDC exposure is connected to infertility, hormone-related cancers, neurological issues, and other disorders.
[02:05:50.063 --> 02:05:58.974]  EDCs do this by blocking or otherwise interfering with the body's natural hormones and hijacking the body's chemical messengers, and they can alter the way cells develop and grow.

[02:07:09.005 --> 02:07:14.446]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[02:07:14.746 --> 02:07:22.468]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver.
[02:07:22.688 --> 02:07:23.248]  I'm good.
[02:07:43.021 --> 02:07:46.382]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.

[02:08:14.150 --> 02:08:17.673]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:08:18.233 --> 02:08:19.995]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:21.015 --> 02:08:24.058]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:27.882]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:27.902 --> 02:08:29.143]  It's Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:08:29.163 --> 02:08:32.706]  We're talking to Theodore Morgan Major about the Gamergate scandal.
[02:08:33.126 --> 02:08:39.291]  Now, if you missed it, I put out a video a couple of days ago about how feminists got before the UN.
[02:08:39.832 --> 02:08:49.060]  And bear in mind, you know, I get tweets, I get Facebook messages from people saying, feminists have no power, they have no influence, just ignore them, they will go away.
[02:08:49.827 --> 02:08:50.648]  Well, not true.
[02:08:51.188 --> 02:09:00.975]  They're embedded deeply within the education system in America with gender studies and now they're going to the UN to try and pressure the UN.
[02:09:01.380 --> 02:09:03.121]  To censor websites.
[02:09:03.161 --> 02:09:14.085]  And this is important because ICANN, which is the organization in charge of domain names on the internet, is basically coming to the end of its contract with the US government.
[02:09:14.505 --> 02:09:16.686]  So that is going to be up for grabs.
[02:09:17.046 --> 02:09:24.449]  The UN has intimated its agenda to try and get control of ICANN, to try and get control of the internet.
[02:09:25.209 --> 02:09:28.410]  So then last week you had these feminists who were involved
[02:09:29.201 --> 02:09:43.148]  Fundamentally in the Gamergate scandal, Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn basically getting up before the UN and saying, people who say you suck or you're a liar on Twitter, those people need to be censored.
[02:09:43.688 --> 02:09:50.191]  So criticizing radical feminism to them is hate speech, is quote cyber violence.
[02:09:50.591 --> 02:09:52.712]  You know, calling Caitlyn Jenner Bruce
[02:09:54.454 --> 02:09:55.677]  That's a hate crime!
[02:09:56.158 --> 02:09:59.065]  That needs to be censored by the United Nations.
[02:09:59.145 --> 02:10:02.393]  And yes, they don't have power over the internet right now.
[02:10:02.974 --> 02:10:04.598]  But if you read the Washington Post...
[02:10:05.305 --> 02:10:10.346]  The United Nations has a radical, dangerous vision for the future of the web.
[02:10:10.626 --> 02:10:12.446]  And this is not InfoWars.com.
[02:10:12.666 --> 02:10:34.510]  This is the Washington Post saying that if they get control of this, if they are able to pressure national governments into forcing Facebook and Twitter to proactively police profiles and posts for content that might be critical, God forbid, towards radical feminists like Anita Sarkeesian.
[02:10:36.551 --> 02:10:38.991]  Then the censorship is coming.
[02:10:39.432 --> 02:10:47.414]  And this is why feminists do have influence, because they're listened to by major political bodies who have influence and power.
[02:10:47.674 --> 02:10:49.535]  They're not just ranting on Tumblr.
[02:10:49.815 --> 02:10:51.556]  They're not just ranting on Twitter.
[02:10:51.876 --> 02:11:01.279]  We can't just ignore them and brush them off as crazy lunatics, because they are being listened to by the likes of the United Nations, by Google,
[02:11:01.949 --> 02:11:08.618]  Google had an ideas panel recently where they, quote, wanted to take on internet harassment.
[02:11:08.938 --> 02:11:13.324]  And of course, the people they consulted for this program are key.
[02:11:13.919 --> 02:11:17.121]  Participants in harassing people on the internet.
[02:11:17.401 --> 02:11:31.667]  We're talking about feminists, for example, in Canada, who out people for saying that somebody who makes a video game, an online video game, in which the participants are able to punch Anita Sarkeesian in the face, maybe shouldn't, you know, be doxxed.
[02:11:32.088 --> 02:11:33.828]  Their address shouldn't be revealed.
[02:11:34.149 --> 02:11:37.030]  They shouldn't be subjected to physical harassment.
[02:11:37.987 --> 02:11:50.722]  That guy in Canada is now facing six months in prison for disagreeing with feminists, while the feminists who encourage people to harass this young teenager in Canada, they're, you know, they're vaunted.
[02:11:51.226 --> 02:12:12.823]  Professionals of, you know, oppression Olympics, and they're the kind of people who are being listened to by Google, by the UN, in terms of censoring anything that's critical of feminists or merely disagreeing with them on the internet, which is why this is a threat, which is why Gamergate is a massive issue and why people should understand it.
[02:12:13.264 --> 02:12:19.489]  And I made a video about this a couple of days ago, and we're going to go to this clip now before we return to our guest.
[02:12:19.509 --> 02:12:20.610]  So let's go to the clip.
[02:12:21.090 --> 02:12:25.492]  Feminists want the UN to censor the internet to prevent cyber violence.
[02:12:25.752 --> 02:12:29.654]  But what does Anita Sarkeesian define as harassment and cyber violence?
[02:12:29.874 --> 02:12:34.636]  Harassment is, as someone had mentioned, it's not just what is legal and illegal, right?
[02:12:34.676 --> 02:12:41.999]  Harassment is threats of violence, but it's also the day-to-day grind of you're a liar, you suck, you, you know... That's right!
[02:12:42.079 --> 02:12:45.120]  Criticizing feminists or calling them out on their bull****.
[02:12:51.663 --> 02:13:00.167]  Everything is sexist, everything is racist, everything is homophobic, and you have to point it all out.
[02:13:01.068 --> 02:13:10.473]  Trans women often face a very specific type of violence called deadnaming, where people post pre-transition names.
[02:13:10.493 --> 02:13:14.495]  So under this definition, referring to Caitlyn Jenner as Bruce
[02:13:14.955 --> 02:13:17.016]  Will be treated as hate speech.
[02:13:17.997 --> 02:13:32.766]  They're actually calling for laws and Chinese-style internet censorship to shut down anyone who hurts their feelings by disagreeing with them on the internet.
[02:13:33.266 --> 02:13:40.249]  They got me tweets and it hurt their feelings and so they had to go to the UN and they had to whine about it.
[02:13:40.389 --> 02:13:40.909]  Unfigured.
[02:13:40.969 --> 02:13:53.594]  The UN wants governments to use their quote, licensing prerogative to ensure that telecoms and search engines are only quote, allowed to connect with the public if they quote, supervise content
[02:13:54.114 --> 02:13:55.595]  And it's dissemination.
[02:13:55.675 --> 02:14:07.503]  So if an ISP or search engine doesn't comply with UN-mandated censorship of anti-feminist content, they'll be cut off from being accessible by the public altogether.
[02:14:07.603 --> 02:14:11.846]  The likes of Twitter and Facebook will be forced to quote, And if you think that's unimaginable,
[02:14:17.970 --> 02:14:26.516]  Then just look at Canada, where a man faces six months in prison for the crime of disagreeing with feminists on Twitter.
[02:14:26.536 --> 02:14:31.639]  54-year-old Greg Elliott was also banned from using the internet for the duration of the trial.
[02:14:31.719 --> 02:14:46.469]  And all this will be overseen by an agency which just appointed Saudi Arabia to head a key UN human rights panel, the country that is about to crucify a 17-year-old for taking part in an anti-government protest.
[02:14:46.549 --> 02:14:47.770]  But of course, these new rules
[02:14:48.110 --> 02:14:49.411]  Won't apply to feminists.
[02:14:49.551 --> 02:15:00.175]  They'll still be free to call for the genocide of men, or putting us all in concentration camps, while making bomb threats against weight loss companies and Gamergate meetups.
[02:15:00.415 --> 02:15:14.800]  So feminists will be free to continue to make death threats against anyone who doesn't embrace their radical ideology, but don't you dare tell Anita Sarkeesian that she sucks, or the UN Thought Police will be knocking at your door.
[02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:16.382]  Everything is sexist.
[02:15:16.442 --> 02:15:17.643]  Everything is racist.
[02:15:17.743 --> 02:15:19.466]  Everything is homophobic.
[02:15:20.066 --> 02:15:21.888]  Everything is sexist.
[02:15:21.989 --> 02:15:25.112]  Everything's offensive to people like me.
[02:15:25.152 --> 02:15:27.255]  Let's go through the checklist.
[02:15:27.495 --> 02:15:28.997]  It's all misogyny.
[02:15:39.793 --> 02:15:44.376]  There you have it, everything is racist, everything is sexist, everything is homophobic.
[02:15:44.797 --> 02:16:07.474]  That was Anita Sarkeesian and she got up in front of the UN and basically said that anyone who accuses feminists of lying or saying you suck should be subject to internet censorship, should have their posts, should have their profiles removed after the United Nations pressures national governments to have that happen.
[02:16:08.194 --> 02:16:15.436]  So again, when people say to me, these feminists are just insane, they have no influence, they have no power, just ignore them, they will go away.
[02:16:15.776 --> 02:16:27.540]  No, they're up in front of the United Nations who could be about to seize control of the internet and pressure governments to censor people for criticizing feminism.
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:36.043]  And they talk about cyber touch, you know, mean tweets being as bad as someone actually physically reaching through the computer screen.
[02:16:37.219 --> 02:16:38.760]  And punching somebody in the face.
[02:16:39.300 --> 02:16:51.125]  We're talking to, I guess, Theodore Morgan Major, who is a researcher within Gamergate, and this is the movement which Anita Sarkeesian, or at least the backlash to it, has prompted.
[02:16:51.786 --> 02:16:58.209]  What did you think when you saw feminists saying we should censor people who say you suck on the internet?
[02:16:58.249 --> 02:16:59.249]  That's crazy, right?
[02:17:06.732 --> 02:17:07.512]  Do we have Theodore?
[02:17:07.532 --> 02:17:10.594]  We may have lost Theodore.
[02:17:10.614 --> 02:17:16.556]  We're going to go to some callers now who want to talk about video games and how they're being used to brainwash the public.
[02:17:17.036 --> 02:17:19.457]  Taylor in Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:17:19.497 --> 02:17:20.277]  Go ahead, Taylor.
[02:17:21.618 --> 02:17:32.782]  Hey, yeah, I wanted to point out some key examples of the predictive programming and basically the desensitizing that the video games are using.
[02:17:32.923 --> 02:17:36.404]  You know, InfoWars has well documented how
[02:17:37.284 --> 02:17:54.451]  The military in the streets is desensitizing us to when they completely take over the government systems, and it's the same thing in the video games, because they're desensitizing us for what's coming, and what's coming that they're showing really isn't that far down the path.
[02:17:54.931 --> 02:18:04.635]  For instance, in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, it starts out in the intro with the M in Modern Warfare 3 flipped, and it's WORLD WAR 3!
[02:18:05.315 --> 02:18:06.396]  And then it flips the M,
[02:18:07.088 --> 02:18:16.855]  And you're starting out in the first level fighting the Russians in New York City, and they have electronic jamming systems on top of the U.S.
[02:18:16.875 --> 02:18:22.660]  Stock Exchange, and you are Delta Force, and you have to go and take down the jamming system.
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:25.122]  And this takes place in August of 2016.
[02:18:25.342 --> 02:18:34.349]  And, you know, it was mainstream news that the main thing that the Russians are working on in terms of technology is
[02:18:36.153 --> 02:18:45.138]  Uh, electronic jamming systems, anti-drone weapons, and, um, let me go to Homefront right here.
[02:18:46.299 --> 02:18:47.539]  This video game is ridiculous.
[02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:49.561]  It's, okay, it's Homefront.
[02:18:49.801 --> 02:18:54.964]  On the back of the video game, America has fallen to a savage military occupation.
[02:18:55.604 --> 02:18:57.785]  Join the resistance and fight for freedom.
[02:18:58.325 --> 02:18:59.806]  The year is 2027.
[02:19:00.787 --> 02:19:04.729]  You know, I think it would actually probably help if you could, if you guys could, like, uh, Google
[02:19:05.379 --> 02:19:07.761]  Homefront video game intro.
[02:19:08.001 --> 02:19:09.542]  I'm sure they probably have it on YouTube.
[02:19:10.342 --> 02:19:18.968]  It starts off with Hillary Clinton and it's like a three minute intro and it is just totally ridiculous.
[02:19:19.128 --> 02:19:21.450]  It shows gas going to $20 a barrel.
[02:19:21.490 --> 02:19:27.134]  It goes year by year in a quick montage edit of just America completely falling.
[02:19:27.894 --> 02:19:34.439]  But then in Black Ops 2, Call of Duty Black Ops 2, you're fighting against all drones
[02:19:35.354 --> 02:19:47.121]  And all robots and it takes place in 2025 and this is kind of a common theme this 2025 getting towards the 2020s and they're showing you exactly what's going to happen and
[02:19:48.596 --> 02:19:51.479]  Right, we'll get our guest's response to that after the break.
[02:19:51.900 --> 02:19:58.407]  With the geopolitical stuff, I think they just try to make these video games like the most insane, crazy scenario you can imagine.
[02:19:58.648 --> 02:20:00.990]  With ISIS, with Russia, so that's why they do that.
[02:20:01.271 --> 02:20:06.156]  We're going to talk more about the social re-education agenda in video games after the break.
[02:20:06.176 --> 02:20:07.698]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[02:20:07.718 --> 02:20:08.219]  Stay tuned.
[02:20:09.457 --> 02:20:12.999]  Just recently, we've witnessed some of the most catastrophic disasters in history.
[02:20:13.279 --> 02:20:19.361]  Be sure to prepare yourself with great-tasting, high-quality, GMO-free food that has a 25-year shelf life.
[02:20:19.902 --> 02:20:23.263]  Of course, we're talking about the foods from SurvivalFoodAlliance.com.
[02:20:23.723 --> 02:20:29.266]  And don't forget, the human body needs up to 3 quarts of water every day to remain healthy and hydrated.
[02:20:29.726 --> 02:20:32.887]  So check out our water bricks at SurvivalFoodAlliance.com.
[02:20:33.308 --> 02:20:35.509]  Go to SurvivalFoodAlliance.com or call 877-223-1776.
[02:20:39.212 --> 02:20:48.535]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day, but growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.
[02:20:48.655 --> 02:20:52.956]  The solution is DefenderShield, the most effective mobile radiation shielding ever developed.
[02:20:53.076 --> 02:20:58.817]  DefenderShield blocks virtually 100% of EMF radiation from cell phones, tablets, and laptops, and starts at just $64.99.

[02:21:09.036 --> 02:21:21.581]  Atmospheric aluminum, mercury exposure, estrogen toxins from plastics, microwaves from cell phones and smart meters, and low-quality foods all combine to create conditions for the very high incidence of disease in our society.
[02:21:21.901 --> 02:21:30.265]  Now more than ever, we all need to be consuming those foods and herbs that epigenetically signal the cells of our body to produce energy, create proteins, and detoxify.
[02:21:30.405 --> 02:21:36.007]  When we properly support our bodies, then even in these toxic times we can promote and achieve excellent health.
[02:21:36.407 --> 02:21:38.708]  One World Way is the first energetically encoded
[02:21:39.028 --> 02:21:39.629]  I think so.
[02:22:09.722 --> 02:22:11.104]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[02:22:11.544 --> 02:22:13.506]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[02:22:14.067 --> 02:22:17.711]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[02:22:17.931 --> 02:22:26.400]  Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[02:22:26.741 --> 02:22:30.024]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[02:22:30.885 --> 02:22:33.969]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[02:22:34.029 --> 02:22:38.654]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[02:22:39.395 --> 02:22:43.619]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[02:22:44.340 --> 02:22:47.143]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[02:22:47.504 --> 02:22:49.726]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[02:22:50.567 --> 02:22:56.833]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallets, sleeves, or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.
[02:22:57.593 --> 02:23:02.838]  You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[02:23:03.198 --> 02:23:04.920]  It is as though the protection is free.

[02:23:10.091 --> 02:23:13.832]  Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day.
[02:23:14.052 --> 02:23:17.834]  And the home security industry wants you to believe that's your only option.
[02:23:18.094 --> 02:23:23.255]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[02:23:23.555 --> 02:23:28.177]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[02:23:28.457 --> 02:23:31.678]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.
[02:23:31.978 --> 02:23:34.059]  But there's a better way to protect your home.
[02:23:34.399 --> 02:23:35.959]  SimplySafe Home Security.

[02:24:27.884 --> 02:24:33.826]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:33.906 --> 02:24:35.546]  I'm your host Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:24:35.606 --> 02:24:40.347]  Again, support us by buying the products at infowarsstore.com.
[02:24:40.387 --> 02:24:51.070]  Of course, we had the recent money bomb, but it's essential that you continue to support us by buying the products, by getting your subscription to prisonplanet.tv.
[02:24:51.470 --> 02:24:54.371]  Of course, a lot of stuff you see uploaded to the YouTube channel
[02:24:55.376 --> 02:25:04.444]  Extra features, extra bonus features, the whole show at PrisonPlanet.tv, special reports, speeches, all kinds of stuff.
[02:25:04.524 --> 02:25:17.314]  It's been going for about 10-11 years now and that really helps us build the platform to challenge the mainstream media narrative, hire more reporters and have a bigger impact.
[02:25:17.694 --> 02:25:22.118]  And Alex Jones talked about the fact that, you know, we have some 41 million people
[02:25:23.021 --> 02:25:25.243]  Visiting the website in a monthly period.
[02:25:25.303 --> 02:25:26.384]  We need to build on that.
[02:25:26.444 --> 02:25:40.717]  We've come so far, but we need your continued support to build that platform just to have the presence to challenge these narratives which are still owned by the mainstream media because they, of course, coalesce together.
[02:25:41.037 --> 02:25:42.138]  They support each other.
[02:25:42.358 --> 02:25:43.059]  They echo.
[02:25:43.279 --> 02:25:44.420]  They parrot each other.
[02:25:44.861 --> 02:25:45.681]  We don't do that.
[02:25:45.962 --> 02:25:47.083]  We're a lone voice.
[02:25:47.813 --> 02:25:58.143]  With our own opinion, with our own viewpoints, and we need your support, so please buy the products at infowarsstore.com and get your subscription at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:25:59.004 --> 02:26:00.605]  We're talking about Gamergate.
[02:26:01.066 --> 02:26:10.855]  We're talking about how Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn, these two radical feminists who are integrally involved in the Gamergate scandal,
[02:26:11.539 --> 02:26:30.355]  Basically got up before the UN and said, we need to pressure the UN to pressure national governments, which the United Nations has agreed to do, that's their agenda, that's their policy, to censor the internet, to prevent ISPs from even having access to the public.
[02:26:30.875 --> 02:26:35.101]  If they refuse to censor anti-radical feminist content.
[02:26:35.581 --> 02:26:44.412]  And the examples, as you heard in the video, that Anita Sarkeesian gave was saying, quote, you suck or saying you're a liar.
[02:26:45.093 --> 02:26:45.454]  So now.
[02:26:45.954 --> 02:26:49.356]  No First Amendment when it comes to radical feminists.
[02:26:49.676 --> 02:26:54.319]  That's hate speech, that's harassment, and that's cyber violence.
[02:26:54.779 --> 02:27:06.785]  Theodore, what did you think when you saw Anita Sarkeesian get up in front of the UN and say, basically, milquetoast criticism of feminists denotes cyber violence?
[02:27:06.845 --> 02:27:09.787]  How insane has it become when it gets to that level?
[02:27:10.627 --> 02:27:11.548]  Utterly laughable.
[02:27:12.149 --> 02:27:14.630]  She reminds me of a man known as Jack Thompson.
[02:27:15.371 --> 02:27:23.478]  This particular individual had ended up doing a similar thing to the Congress in his efforts at lobbying censorship for games, more locally.
[02:27:23.978 --> 02:27:38.870]  He had ended up being laughed out of the room, and eventually, Duder's antics got disbarred, with the media mocking him and laughing at him all the way, despite getting all the death and rape threats that Anita Sarkeesian also has been getting.
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:55.801]  Let us talk about those threats because this whole Gamergate controversy, how the media has treated it, is based on the supposition that the only threats are coming from Gamergate supporters and that radical feminists never make threats.
[02:27:56.121 --> 02:27:57.263]  They never threaten to
[02:27:57.643 --> 02:27:59.243]  Hashtag kill all men.
[02:27:59.664 --> 02:28:06.966]  Me personally, I've had direct death threats from feminists who threatened to behead me, who threatened to put me on a guillotine.
[02:28:07.286 --> 02:28:10.007]  You know, their Twitter accounts don't even get shut down.
[02:28:10.447 --> 02:28:20.730]  We had the Protein World situation where radical feminists threatened to bomb this weight loss company because they had a poster campaign featuring a thin model.
[02:28:21.010 --> 02:28:25.451]  We had Gamergate meetups that had bomb threats leveled against them.
[02:28:25.851 --> 02:28:34.678]  How ridiculous is it when the majority from what I see of the threats, of the actual threats, are coming from radical feminists and SJWs themselves?
[02:28:35.618 --> 02:28:35.979]  Oh yeah.
[02:28:36.419 --> 02:28:39.141]  I'd ended up documenting an earlier piece.
[02:28:39.221 --> 02:28:40.342]  It was during October.
[02:28:40.382 --> 02:28:41.683]  You might be familiar with it.
[02:28:42.003 --> 02:28:43.725]  Remember Brianna Wu?
[02:28:43.945 --> 02:28:46.667]  One of the women chased out of games, supposedly.
[02:28:47.407 --> 02:28:49.769]  She had ended up getting in international news.
[02:28:50.310 --> 02:28:54.453]  She had ended up getting like 40 bloody articles in like over a weekend.
[02:28:56.134 --> 02:29:03.516]  I had ended up comparing it with another person that had gotten a similar threat that was known on Twitter as Gigi Feminist.
[02:29:03.936 --> 02:29:10.058]  She had ended up finally getting a mention in a Vice article about two months after the death threat incident.
[02:29:11.098 --> 02:29:20.861]  In stark contrast to Brianna Wu, who was supporting the feminist narrative of victimhood, had gotten 40 plus articles over the course of a weekend.
[02:29:22.071 --> 02:29:35.081]  And yet ABC News has these specials where they literally show Anita Sarkeesian getting into a cop car, saying how, you know, frightened she is by all these Gamergate supporters that are levelling these violent threats.
[02:29:35.101 --> 02:29:35.642]  Huge flash!
[02:29:36.551 --> 02:29:40.196]  Anyone who is a public figure gets death threats.
[02:29:40.416 --> 02:29:40.816]  Anyone.
[02:29:40.876 --> 02:29:42.719]  No matter what their political viewpoint.
[02:29:43.079 --> 02:29:46.984]  We'll be back after the break with Theodore Morgan Major talking about Gamergate.
[02:29:47.004 --> 02:29:47.484]  800-259-9231.
[02:29:47.504 --> 02:29:47.644]  800-259-9231.
[02:29:47.665 --> 02:29:49.347]  Your calls coming up.
[02:29:49.387 --> 02:29:49.967]  Stay tuned.
[02:29:58.536 --> 02:30:01.538]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.479 --> 02:30:05.220]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:05.481 --> 02:30:07.082]  Yeah, good old Brianna.
[02:30:09.184 --> 02:30:15.407]  In the wake of Pope Francis visiting the United States and barely addressing the issue of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, we have this.
[02:30:15.607 --> 02:30:23.691]  Former House Speaker Dennis Hastert negotiating a guilty plea over charges he paid $3.5 million in hush money to cover up sexual contact with a male.
[02:30:23.811 --> 02:30:31.434]  The Daily Mail reports a May indictment says Hastert agreed to pay $3.5 million to someone identified only as Individual A to hide past misconduct.
[02:30:31.554 --> 02:30:35.716]  It has been claimed that Individual A is a victim of sexual abuse that Hastert was attempting to silence.
[02:30:36.036 --> 02:30:43.281]  Citing anonymous sources, the AP reports that the payments were intended to conceal claims of sexual misconduct believed to be linked to his days as a high school teacher.
[02:30:43.501 --> 02:30:48.044]  Before leaving Congress in 2007, Hastert was the longest ever serving Republican speaker.
[02:30:48.084 --> 02:30:51.106]  Because when you have skeletons in the closet, you are easy to control.
[02:30:51.387 --> 02:30:54.329]  Hastert was a wrestling coach and teacher from 1965 to 1981.
[02:30:54.789 --> 02:30:59.412]  Hastert took groups of boys on foreign trips, including diving expeditions to the Bahamas.
[02:30:59.672 --> 02:31:05.236]  And now that John Boehner is stepping down under his own free will, it makes you wonder what skeletons he's hiding in his closet.
[02:31:05.356 --> 02:31:08.194]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:31:09.042 --> 02:31:12.245]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:12.545 --> 02:31:20.551]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:20.791 --> 02:31:25.836]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:31:26.216 --> 02:31:28.498]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:31:28.738 --> 02:31:30.519]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:35.043]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:31:38.914 --> 02:31:39.834]  Brain Force is here.
[02:31:40.034 --> 02:31:42.095]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:31:42.115 --> 02:31:46.977]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:31:47.217 --> 02:31:50.399]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:31:50.499 --> 02:31:53.700]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:55.761]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:31:55.981 --> 02:31:56.862]  It doesn't have stimulants.

[02:33:31.169 --> 02:33:33.010]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.970 --> 02:33:38.631]  We're back live.
[02:33:38.691 --> 02:33:39.752]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:39.792 --> 02:33:41.452]  I'm your host Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:33:41.472 --> 02:33:47.474]  We got Rob Duke coming up with the fourth hour overdrive, so be sure to stay tuned for that.
[02:33:47.494 --> 02:33:50.995]  At the moment we're talking about internet censorship.
[02:33:51.055 --> 02:33:54.376]  The United Nations and Gamergate were taking your calls at 800-259-
[02:33:56.817 --> 02:34:12.971]  9231.
[02:33:57.878 --> 02:34:12.971]  And we're talking to our guest Theodore Morgan Major, who is the head of a research team into Gamergate, and we're explaining how this is a move by extreme radical left-wingers, by social justice warriors, to hijack control of the video games industry.
[02:34:13.746 --> 02:34:20.111]  Because the television news industry, Hollywood, is increasingly distrusted by the general public.
[02:34:20.511 --> 02:34:30.880]  So they need to move into different genres to push this political propaganda, to push this re-education and social engineering.
[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:34.643]  We've got a YouTube clip which was produced by our guest.
[02:34:35.737 --> 02:34:47.739]  In which these social engineers talk about how they've openly, brazenly got an agenda to use video games to push this political re-education and how they're going to do it.
[02:34:47.779 --> 02:34:48.859]  Let's go to that clip.
[02:34:49.299 --> 02:34:53.420]  We have an opportunity to create a new form of games.
[02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:56.641]  We need to design games that are good for learning.
[02:34:56.681 --> 02:35:01.162]  We can change people's perspective on race or on gender through play.
[02:35:01.242 --> 02:35:03.042]  Motivation in changing behavior.
[02:35:03.602 --> 02:35:07.723]  So through the Difference Engine Initiative, we seek to plant the seeds of change.
[02:35:08.023 --> 02:35:10.104]  Yeah, I have an agenda, sorry!
[02:35:10.184 --> 02:35:12.945]  But it works, and I don't know how it works.
[02:35:14.725 --> 02:35:20.747]  So that clip basically, it's a bunch of different people involved in this video games industry that...
[02:35:21.744 --> 02:35:23.244]  They're working together.
[02:35:23.484 --> 02:35:25.005]  That's what I have to emphasize here.
[02:35:25.045 --> 02:35:31.026]  This is a program that's coordinated to re-engineer the population through video games.
[02:35:31.466 --> 02:35:36.408]  Theodore, just explain who was talking in that clip and what they were talking about.
[02:35:37.968 --> 02:35:42.189]  Um... There's a few of them.
[02:35:43.749 --> 02:35:44.810]  Let me boot it up.
[02:35:45.450 --> 02:35:46.450]  I got a documenter.
[02:35:48.289 --> 02:35:51.832]  But what are the social re-education agendas that they're pushing?
[02:35:54.354 --> 02:35:56.456]  They're specifically pushing for EdTech.
[02:35:56.996 --> 02:36:04.802]  They want to get more money into that for games as training aids, as learning aids, as opposed to entertainment.
[02:36:05.423 --> 02:36:11.788]  There's more money to be had in that and it's far more malleable for message-based gaming, which will serve their ideology better.
[02:36:14.341 --> 02:36:17.024]  So that, and this is a coordinated agenda, right?
[02:36:17.044 --> 02:36:22.309]  This isn't just a matter of consensus where they each hold these individual beliefs.
[02:36:22.329 --> 02:36:23.811]  They're actually working together.
[02:36:24.171 --> 02:36:31.859]  We have the release, the gaming journos list that was released where behind the scenes they were conspiring to do this, correct?
[02:36:32.751 --> 02:36:40.014]  Yeah, there was a specific instance in how they were covering the Zoe Quinn issue, otherwise known as Conspiracy or Burgers and Fries.
[02:36:40.454 --> 02:36:43.115]  It was the incident before, right, that hit before Gamergate.
[02:36:44.056 --> 02:36:47.617]  And they were talking about giving Zoe Quinn GIFs, of all things.
[02:36:49.518 --> 02:36:52.999]  So this is an agenda that's, again, very orchestrated.
[02:36:53.620 --> 02:36:56.181]  Morgan in Virginia, you're on the air.
[02:36:56.241 --> 02:36:57.021]  Morgan, go ahead.
[02:36:58.101 --> 02:36:59.222]  Hey there, how's it going, guys?
[02:36:59.922 --> 02:37:00.262]  Good, and you?
[02:37:00.282 --> 02:37:01.523]  Good, go ahead with your question.
[02:37:02.597 --> 02:37:11.860]  Well, um, I would like to ask you guys, um, what do you guys think is the direction that, uh, they're trying to take us with these video games that they're releasing now on the mainstream?
[02:37:11.900 --> 02:37:14.360]  Because I've been kind of, uh, out of the loop.
[02:37:14.380 --> 02:37:15.661]  I'm a huge gamer myself.
[02:37:15.781 --> 02:37:21.182]  I mean, I've been playing games for years, but I, I've been kind of disillusioned with most of the games that have been coming out.
[02:37:21.242 --> 02:37:24.023]  Cause I like to do, you know, player versus player interaction and everything.
[02:37:24.083 --> 02:37:29.184]  And they're kind of shying away from sort of like the Olympic, like sporting event kind of thing.
[02:37:29.244 --> 02:37:31.885]  And they're like, you guys were saying, they're kind of working on this weird,
[02:37:32.771 --> 02:37:46.516]  Re-education stuff and so I'm wondering what's the direction they're taking because like you know I like to read and everything as well like Ender's Game kind of is something that I'm sort of relating this to in a way because where's that point?
[02:37:47.097 --> 02:37:57.981]  Where's that endgame where they're gonna like say to us hey you know you guys have been under all this you know programming and everything for all these years oops sorry you know we didn't tell you that.
[02:37:59.145 --> 02:38:01.167]  Well, where does that point come out?
[02:38:01.507 --> 02:38:02.868]  What's the direction they're leading us?
[02:38:02.908 --> 02:38:05.029]  What are they trying to make us do?
[02:38:05.049 --> 02:38:11.734]  You know, instead of killing aliens out in space, you know, sorry, spoilers, you know, what are we actually fighting?
[02:38:11.814 --> 02:38:13.895]  What are we doing with all this video gaming?
[02:38:14.996 --> 02:38:18.779]  Exactly, this is what I wanted to get to, and Theodore, I'll get your comments on this.
[02:38:19.551 --> 02:38:21.092]  What exactly are they pushing?
[02:38:21.112 --> 02:38:31.436]  We had a caller before the break who was talking about Call of Duty, and of course they're pushing, you know, Russia as the main geopolitical enemy in those kind of war games.
[02:38:31.977 --> 02:38:41.361]  Obviously that would be expected, not particularly from a re-education viewpoint because, you know, the current narrative is the US versus Russia.
[02:38:41.901 --> 02:38:43.743]  You know, in the geopolitical landscape.
[02:38:44.143 --> 02:38:47.786]  But we're talking about how they're pushing radical feminism.
[02:38:48.146 --> 02:38:56.493]  Again, we see it at the gender studies level, where they're trying to drive a wedge between men and women by pushing supremacy.
[02:38:56.854 --> 02:38:59.235]  Radical feminism is not about equality.
[02:38:59.536 --> 02:39:01.417]  It's not about egalitarianism.
[02:39:01.798 --> 02:39:06.962]  It's about female supremacy, and it's about driving home their political agenda
[02:39:07.828 --> 02:39:16.080]  Riding on the coattails of feminism, which in its first instance, in its first incarnation, was legitimate, was necessary, was justified.
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:24.572]  But now they're doing it to push this kind of authoritarianism, which suppresses and censors free speech.
[02:39:25.092 --> 02:39:27.014]  And that's why governments are getting involved.
[02:39:27.394 --> 02:39:31.718]  That's why universities are getting involved, because they've been signed over to this program.
[02:39:31.938 --> 02:39:40.625]  That's why the United Nations is getting involved, because this is about restricting freedom of speech and collating power into the hands of government.
[02:39:40.965 --> 02:39:55.818]  Into fewer and fewer hands, which is why radical feminism is attractive to the state and to modern power structures, because it's no longer about instilling power within the individual, it's about instilling power within state bodies.
[02:39:56.319 --> 02:39:59.722]  So how are they pushing that in these video games?
[02:39:59.822 --> 02:40:00.723]  Theodore, go ahead.
[02:40:01.690 --> 02:40:06.774]  They're pushing it by promoting their particular ideology, specifically intersectionality.
[02:40:07.154 --> 02:40:10.897]  That belief is... Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:40:11.438 --> 02:40:17.943]  That belief is that there's bias in everything, which is why you might end up hearing a Neo-Sarkeesian talking about how there's sexism and racism everywhere.
[02:40:18.483 --> 02:40:21.966]  Because, in her mind, there is sexism and racism everywhere.
[02:40:22.466 --> 02:40:22.807]  Anyways.
[02:40:23.587 --> 02:40:28.051]  The particular method to which they're going by is a process called captology.
[02:40:30.032 --> 02:40:34.276]  It is Games and Persuasive Tech.
[02:40:34.716 --> 02:40:37.138]  It was started by a man known as B.J.
[02:40:37.539 --> 02:40:40.081]  Fogg, or coined by him.
[02:40:40.441 --> 02:40:45.306]  It was started in board games in the past, but over time it got adapted for video games.
[02:40:45.786 --> 02:40:54.234]  And he's been trying to steadily push papers to encourage more game makers to follow his particular demands.
[02:40:55.928 --> 02:41:04.253]  And this is about using the tools of technology, using computers, using video games to push persuasive ideologies.
[02:41:04.293 --> 02:41:07.995]  So it's not about, you know, acquiescing to consumer demand.
[02:41:08.075 --> 02:41:11.637]  It's not about keeping people entertained, which they pay good money for.
[02:41:11.977 --> 02:41:13.898]  It's about using these technologies.
[02:41:14.358 --> 02:41:23.667]  To try and push their political agenda, which again goes back to this idea of radical feminism, censoring, suppressing free speech.
[02:41:24.168 --> 02:41:25.089]  That's what it's all about.
[02:41:25.109 --> 02:41:26.430]  That's what Gamergate is all about.
[02:41:26.770 --> 02:41:34.097]  We're going to go to some more callers in a moment, but Theodore, just give us a plug for your YouTube channel and how people can find out more information.
[02:41:34.818 --> 02:41:40.959]  If you want to see the series, you can see it at youtube.com slash thydrinbrisbane.
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:45.680]  T-H-I-D-R-A-N-B-R-I-S-B-A-N-E.
[02:41:47.701 --> 02:41:49.321]  Okay, Theodore, thanks for joining us.
[02:41:50.021 --> 02:41:53.982]  We've got Alex Jones on the line now with breaking news.
[02:41:54.042 --> 02:41:56.603]  Do we have Alex ready or do we need to go to another call?
[02:41:57.403 --> 02:42:01.044]  Alright, we'll go to Tim in Wyoming on Zuckerberg censorship.
[02:42:01.084 --> 02:42:01.584]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:42:08.291 --> 02:42:08.611]  Hello?
[02:42:10.012 --> 02:42:11.332]  Yes, Tim, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:42:12.193 --> 02:42:13.693]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call.
[02:42:14.154 --> 02:42:25.958]  I wanted to mention, I don't know if you have mentioned it or not, but Mark Zuckerberg talking to Angela Merkel and he said basically that he was working, well essentially, I mean he didn't say those words,
[02:42:26.664 --> 02:42:31.991]  Exactly, but he said he was working on trying to keep people from saying certain things on Facebook.
[02:42:32.191 --> 02:42:40.302]  Now, when the companies are self-censoring, and in partnership with the government, and the government says, oh, you can go above and beyond, why not?
[02:42:41.522 --> 02:42:43.083]  People talk about conspiracies.
[02:42:43.123 --> 02:42:44.744]  They say conspiracy theory.
[02:42:45.144 --> 02:42:46.805]  Well, this is obviously a conspiracy.
[02:42:46.845 --> 02:42:48.486]  This is a conspiracy reality.
[02:42:48.806 --> 02:42:50.126]  This is not a... It is, exactly.
[02:42:50.146 --> 02:42:53.188]  We've got breaking news now, so we'll say goodbye to the caller.
[02:42:53.208 --> 02:42:54.188]  We covered that, actually.
[02:42:54.208 --> 02:42:55.769]  Mikael Thelen wrote an article about it.
[02:42:55.869 --> 02:43:08.916]  And Germans are also under threat of having their children snatched for anti-migrant Facebook posts, while Mark Zuckerberg schemes with Angela Merkel to censor anti-migrant Facebook posts.
[02:43:09.276 --> 02:43:29.151]  So again, the argument that this internet censorship agenda is not a threat, is not an issue, completely debunked by the fact that major companies like Facebook are scheming with heads of government to censor people, and in Germany they're now talking about even snatching people's children for anti-migrant posts.
[02:43:29.191 --> 02:43:32.273]  But we've got Alex Jones now on the air with breaking news.
[02:43:32.353 --> 02:43:32.934]  Alex, go ahead.
[02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:34.941]  Absolutely.
[02:43:35.101 --> 02:43:42.289]  I'm out here in the middle of nowhere in West Texas dove hunting with my son trying to keep the 2nd Amendment alive.
[02:43:42.309 --> 02:43:47.875]  I know it's not about hunting, but hunting is what funds the pro-gun lobby and movement.
[02:43:47.915 --> 02:43:49.657]  So make no mistake, I used to always say
[02:43:50.458 --> 02:43:50.978]  I don't know.
[02:44:05.194 --> 02:44:05.915]  We're good to go.
[02:44:24.149 --> 02:44:24.910]  We're good to go.
[02:44:54.127 --> 02:44:58.550]  Because I talked to Biggs and Kit last night about it, but I guess we haven't quite launched it yet.
[02:44:58.970 --> 02:45:01.852]  Yes, folks, I'll be live on the radio tomorrow, Lord willing.
[02:45:02.713 --> 02:45:12.179]  But we need everybody to get down to UT, where the Bloomberg front groups are going to be calling for banning gun shows and transferring firearms to families.
[02:45:12.459 --> 02:45:16.302]  And to them, I say this, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hand.
[02:45:17.771 --> 02:45:19.712]  That's what it comes down to, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:45:19.732 --> 02:45:21.454]  That's my 12 games coming off right there.
[02:45:21.814 --> 02:45:23.915]  We are never going to submit to you trash.
[02:45:24.236 --> 02:45:25.977]  We know you want to dominate and control us.
[02:45:25.997 --> 02:45:28.499]  You can go straight back to hell where you scum came from.
[02:45:28.919 --> 02:45:41.028]  So, the articles on InfoWars.com, I don't care if it's five people or a hundred people, when we had 1,500 folks down there for the open carry defying the illegal law San Antonio had at the Alamo a few years ago,
[02:45:42.068 --> 02:45:45.090]  At that amazing event, these very same people crawled out from under a rock.
[02:45:45.391 --> 02:45:47.912]  They had no one at their rally.
[02:45:48.112 --> 02:45:51.835]  But Al Jazeera, CNN, and all the enemy operatives, MSNBC, were there.
[02:45:52.235 --> 02:45:54.937]  We went in and hijacked their event.
[02:45:55.297 --> 02:45:57.178]  They blew up, made fools out of themselves.
[02:45:57.218 --> 02:46:03.342]  So whether 10 people or 500 show up tomorrow on short notice, tomorrow Joe Big will be down there at noon at UT.
[02:46:03.562 --> 02:46:08.986]  There's a map and an article at InfoWars.com as we fight these people who are trying to literally castrate us.
[02:46:09.266 --> 02:46:09.506]  I think so.
[02:46:28.758 --> 02:46:33.565]  Worldwide, 1776 is rising, and I want to see folks down there tomorrow.
[02:46:33.825 --> 02:46:37.049]  Paul, I hope this all came through via cell phone, because I am in the middle of nowhere.
[02:46:37.290 --> 02:46:43.458]  I hiked up the top of a hill, out here in 95 degree temperatures, and the rattlesnakes get this transmission to you, did you get it?
[02:46:44.864 --> 02:46:49.528]  Yeah, we got it loud and clear, Alex, and that story is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:46:49.629 --> 02:46:56.976]  InfoWars announced a Second Amendment rally at UT Austin tomorrow, October 1st at 12 noon.
[02:46:57.436 --> 02:47:05.864]  This is going to take place at the West Mall at the University of Texas at Austin, so be sure to join in with that rally.
[02:47:05.904 --> 02:47:06.885]  That's tomorrow, 12 noon.
[02:47:10.944 --> 02:47:12.265]  What it comes down to is this, Paul.
[02:47:12.505 --> 02:47:19.369]  They want to have it on these UT reservations, these college, police state, anti-free speech reservations, so there can be no dissenting views.
[02:47:19.769 --> 02:47:22.711]  US citizens are allowed to go there and have your views heard.
[02:47:22.931 --> 02:47:24.812]  So this is a flash rally.
[02:47:25.092 --> 02:47:26.873]  Let's add that to the headline.
[02:47:27.273 --> 02:47:30.275]  Okay, that's Alex Jones, and be sure to attend that rally tomorrow.
[02:47:30.395 --> 02:47:32.436]  Back to the callers now, Sherry in Colorado.
[02:47:32.476 --> 02:47:34.317]  Sherry, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:47:53.764 --> 02:47:57.046]  Hi, just a couple of comments and then maybe your opinion.
[02:47:57.066 --> 02:48:04.431]  I tweeted Alex last night as well as Donald Trump and even Hillary Clinton.
[02:48:05.352 --> 02:48:09.475]  I'm German, Indian, female, I'm a woman, I'm black, and I'm a Christian.
[02:48:10.255 --> 02:48:12.337]  Nobody's bothered to ask me what I think.
[02:48:12.997 --> 02:48:14.799]  Nobody's gonna tell me what to think.
[02:48:14.859 --> 02:48:16.820]  Nobody's gonna tell me what to say.
[02:48:17.641 --> 02:48:21.043]  So these nasty women who say they're speaking for everyone,
[02:48:21.795 --> 02:48:27.299]  I don't see anybody outside of King Soopers or Walmart taking polls asking women's opinions.
[02:48:28.399 --> 02:48:32.242]  You know, the missing votes in California for the vaccination.
[02:48:33.122 --> 02:48:35.424]  I wish InfoWars would put a link.
[02:48:35.884 --> 02:48:38.966]  It's only, you know, 11 o'clock in California.
[02:48:40.007 --> 02:48:47.652]  If every student got a bulletin over the loudspeaker, have your parents go on InfoWars today and sign that link.
[02:48:48.413 --> 02:48:52.434]  We would make up the more than 360,000 signatures.
[02:48:53.374 --> 02:48:55.295]  And Alex keeps saying it's a playbook.
[02:48:55.335 --> 02:48:57.035]  I know what they're doing because it's a playbook.
[02:48:57.615 --> 02:48:58.796]  It's like a chess game.
[02:48:59.136 --> 02:48:59.876]  It's a move.
[02:49:00.116 --> 02:49:01.156]  We're the pawns.
[02:49:01.877 --> 02:49:03.437]  The bishops are making their moves.
[02:49:03.897 --> 02:49:07.678]  They think they know what's going on, but only the king and queen know what's going on.
[02:49:08.238 --> 02:49:09.139]  We're the pawns.
[02:49:09.819 --> 02:49:10.739]  It's a chess game.
[02:49:11.675 --> 02:49:18.001]  And we've seen a rise in prominence of black conservative voices and a backlash against them.
[02:49:18.281 --> 02:49:24.607]  What do you think about the 14 year old, I don't know if you saw this, who basically came out with some YouTube videos criticizing Obama.
[02:49:24.887 --> 02:49:27.489]  The White House publicly shamed him for doing so.
[02:49:27.529 --> 02:49:28.450]  Do you know that story?
[02:49:30.538 --> 02:49:39.325]  I've seen bits and pieces of it, and I think as long as we continue to feed into the mainstream media, like my parents, they think I'm crazy.
[02:49:39.405 --> 02:49:42.888]  Mom says if it doesn't show up on AP, she's not going to believe it.
[02:49:43.428 --> 02:49:45.450]  Well, you know, the Internet is a wonderful thing.
[02:49:45.470 --> 02:49:49.293]  You can Google California and see the missing link.
[02:49:49.773 --> 02:49:51.094]  Now you need to know why.
[02:49:51.635 --> 02:49:53.296]  It's all a chess game.
[02:49:53.908 --> 02:50:01.955]  So if we ignore them, we're getting Boehner out, we need to get McConnell out, we need to set examples for Congress and the Senate.
[02:50:01.995 --> 02:50:05.518]  But look, if we'll go after Boehner, we'll go after you.
[02:50:05.979 --> 02:50:07.580]  You need to vote for the people.
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:11.904]  Ron Paul needs to take off the little panties and put on big boy pants.
[02:50:12.498 --> 02:50:13.619]  And he needs to fight.
[02:50:13.899 --> 02:50:15.601]  He needs to play the chess game.
[02:50:16.061 --> 02:50:17.062]  He needs to get loud.
[02:50:17.322 --> 02:50:18.323]  He needs to get vocal.
[02:50:18.723 --> 02:50:20.164]  And he needs to get strong.
[02:50:20.745 --> 02:50:21.705]  I'm a single parent.
[02:50:21.745 --> 02:50:23.907]  There's not a whole lot I can do to support.
[02:50:24.347 --> 02:50:25.488]  I can't demonstrate.
[02:50:25.809 --> 02:50:31.413]  But I have InfoWars on my windshield and GCMAF and been driving around with it for seven months.
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:35.481]  And I tweeted everybody, I'm asking for the Lord's protection.
[02:50:35.961 --> 02:50:42.523]  And while I've got you, real quick, and Alex has so many listeners, Yeshua is not the name of Jesus Christ.
[02:50:42.683 --> 02:50:44.784]  People need to look at the Bible.
[02:50:45.264 --> 02:50:48.585]  They say that a million Christians or more will not go in the end.
[02:50:49.305 --> 02:50:52.787]  It's because they're calling for a false god.
[02:50:53.308 --> 02:50:57.690]  They need to call for Jesus Christ or the Messiah.
[02:50:58.211 --> 02:50:59.051]  Not Yeshua.
[02:50:59.071 --> 02:51:01.893]  Yeshua is no different than calling for Pluto.
[02:51:03.264 --> 02:51:06.207]  Okay, we'll be back with more of your calls after the break.
[02:51:06.227 --> 02:51:10.370]  Again, it's really positive that more black conservative voices are speaking out.
[02:51:10.410 --> 02:51:11.892]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:51:12.192 --> 02:51:13.493]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:51:13.853 --> 02:51:16.175]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:51:16.676 --> 02:51:18.537]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:51:18.978 --> 02:51:23.021]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:51:23.482 --> 02:51:27.185]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:51:27.425 --> 02:51:30.828]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problems.
[02:51:31.169 --> 02:51:31.590]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:51:31.610 --> 02:51:32.953]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:51:38.666 --> 02:51:41.067]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.
[02:51:41.287 --> 02:51:42.228]  Get back to nature.
[02:51:42.368 --> 02:51:49.411]  Expand your horizons with the highest quality, most versatile, unique slingshots and sling bows on the market at slingbow.com.
[02:51:49.551 --> 02:51:52.292]  Slingbow products are compact and models start from just $17.98.
[02:51:52.593 --> 02:51:56.174]  They're perfect for your bug out bag or storing in your vehicle.
[02:51:56.414 --> 02:52:00.316]  Give yourself and your loved ones the excitement and tradition of slingbow.
[02:52:00.536 --> 02:52:04.858]  A new frontier in archery and truly modern twist on this primitive survival tool.
[02:52:05.059 --> 02:52:07.700]  Feel the thrill only at slingbow.com.
[02:52:08.220 --> 02:52:12.002]  Did you know that the average cost for a family of four to attend a professional baseball game is over $200?
[02:52:13.122 --> 02:52:17.985]  At the same time, over 40% of all sports, concert, and theater tickets go unsold.
[02:52:18.205 --> 02:52:21.046]  So how come we're all paying so much when so many seats go empty?
[02:52:22.167 --> 02:52:24.488]  I'm Adam Kanter, founder of ScoreBig.com.
[02:52:24.728 --> 02:52:29.811]  We found a way to work directly with teams and venues to get their unsold seats and pass the huge savings on to you.

[02:53:08.482 --> 02:53:15.847]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[02:53:16.147 --> 02:53:19.049]  that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.
[02:53:19.549 --> 02:53:23.311]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.
[02:53:23.811 --> 02:53:36.958]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that is safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast, and a limited number of parasites.
[02:53:37.378 --> 02:53:39.339]  It can even purify water!
[02:53:39.719 --> 02:53:44.362]  Supernatural Silver comes in both liquid and gel for internal or external use.

[02:54:15.532 --> 02:54:27.594]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:27.634 --> 02:54:34.716]  It's the final segment, but we've got the fourth hour overdrive coming up with Rob Dew, so be sure to stay tuned for that.
[02:54:34.896 --> 02:54:39.836]  Rob, we'll be taking more of your calls, but now we're going to go quickfire through these final calls.
[02:54:40.417 --> 02:54:42.577]  Walt in Missouri, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:54:45.051 --> 02:54:47.132]  Hello, Paul.
[02:54:49.113 --> 02:55:03.798]  Until it's recognized by our country as the Jesuit Pope, once Jesuit Pope, is now calling for a new world order, the Jesuits have been after world government since 1540 for the Vatican.
[02:55:04.979 --> 02:55:10.861]  They've been behind all the wars in Europe and all the wars we've had to fight in our country for freedom.
[02:55:12.327 --> 02:55:17.008]  Until the Jesuits are identified as that force, it'll continue.
[02:55:18.528 --> 02:55:26.170]  Yeah, and I made a video about how the Pope has basically betrayed Christianity, betrayed Catholics, completely sold out the religion.
[02:55:26.490 --> 02:55:40.373]  He's now embracing the mass Muslim invasion of migrants, while Muslim Imams openly call for Muslims to outbreed Western Europeans so they can impose Sharia law.
[02:55:40.613 --> 02:55:41.993]  So the Pope's a complete sellout.
[02:55:42.438 --> 02:55:48.423]  We've been banging on that for the past two weeks, and that's a good video that you can check out on that issue.
[02:55:48.983 --> 02:55:51.325]  Frank in Massachusetts, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:55:51.345 --> 02:56:08.199]  I was going to add that hot on the heels of Jeremy Corbyn of the UK Labour Party preaching about how Marxism is now back in style and all this pushing for Bernie Sanders, a company called Ubisoft was promoting one of their games coming soon.
[02:56:09.248 --> 02:56:16.234]  And they were bragging about how they're integrating Karl Marx into the cast, along with a transsexual character.
[02:56:19.236 --> 02:56:20.878]  Really?
[02:56:20.898 --> 02:56:22.899]  Well, why would you be opposed to that?
[02:56:22.959 --> 02:56:24.961]  Surely that's trendy and progressive, right?
[02:56:26.282 --> 02:56:27.143]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[02:56:27.843 --> 02:56:36.030]  And this is also the same company that had to rework one of their games that Jakari Jackson might have talked about, called Rainbow Six, where they had a Tea Party-esque type of
[02:56:37.633 --> 02:56:40.295]  A group of terrorists going against the government.
[02:56:42.436 --> 02:56:51.921]  No, we've catalogued it for a while, and again, this is key because video games are the biggest grossing entertainment industry above Hollywood.
[02:56:52.041 --> 02:56:53.122]  That's now official.
[02:56:53.502 --> 02:56:55.723]  So we have to pay attention to Gamergate.
[02:56:55.783 --> 02:56:57.164]  People need to learn about it.
[02:56:57.644 --> 02:57:02.107]  It seems quite technical and obtuse from the outset, but people really need to learn about it.
[02:57:02.467 --> 02:57:17.130]  Because this is a fundamental threat to free speech, because now they're going beyond video games, taking their case to the UN, and saying the internet should be censored because of quote, cyber violence, which under their definition is saying, you suck!
[02:57:17.470 --> 02:57:19.090]  No, that's not cyber violence.
[02:57:19.330 --> 02:57:29.212]  That's called the first frigging amendment, and it needs to remain, the internet needs to remain as the Wild West, the final beacon of freedom, as it truly is.
[02:57:29.672 --> 02:57:31.993]  Alex in Wisconsin, you're on the air, go ahead Alex.
[02:57:34.141 --> 02:57:34.401]  Hi!
[02:57:34.441 --> 02:57:36.063]  Can you hear me?
[02:57:36.103 --> 02:57:36.683]  Hey, go ahead.
[02:57:38.645 --> 02:57:40.987]  Um, is Theodore still on the line?
[02:57:42.028 --> 02:57:43.750]  No, he's not, but I can answer your questions.
[02:57:43.790 --> 02:57:44.130]  Go ahead.
[02:57:45.471 --> 02:57:52.177]  Alright, well, how much do you know about the Honey Badger Brigade up in, uh, Canada?
[02:57:54.019 --> 02:57:58.463]  I think that's, uh, is that Lauren Southern and Karen Stroughton?
[02:58:00.712 --> 02:58:09.094]  Uh, yeah, it's comprised of mainly female women who are avid anti-feminists and they give talks on men's rights.
[02:58:10.034 --> 02:58:26.238]  And the other night, a good friend of Karen's was actually, um, on Tumblr, feminists in Canada called to boycott the entire speech because they were handing out pamphlets
[02:58:27.165 --> 02:58:37.194]  about fake one in four statistics that are thrown around campuses and it ended up that they didn't know it was going to happen until the night before.
[02:58:38.706 --> 02:58:46.695]  So everyone... It's amazing, we've had these flyers that, you know, calling someone a slut, calling a woman a slut, is akin to sexual violence.
[02:58:46.975 --> 02:58:48.577]  We'll be back with Rob Due.
[02:58:48.617 --> 02:58:50.439]  That is it for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:58:50.479 --> 02:58:54.263]  I've been Paul Jones of Fox and your calls with Rob Due coming up live.
[02:58:54.643 --> 02:58:55.284]  Stay tuned.
[02:58:59.414 --> 02:58:59.774]  We're good.
[02:59:28.892 --> 02:59:29.833]  BrainForce is here.
[02:59:30.013 --> 02:59:32.134]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:59:32.234 --> 02:59:36.956]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:59:37.216 --> 02:59:40.358]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:59:40.498 --> 02:59:43.720]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:45.801]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:59:45.981 --> 02:59:47.862]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:59:47.882 --> 02:59:49.983]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:59:50.083 --> 02:59:55.666]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:00:01.627 --> 03:00:04.348]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.810 --> 03:00:17.832]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:18.452 --> 03:00:21.433]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:24.890 --> 03:00:25.470]  That's right.
[03:00:25.510 --> 03:00:27.691]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:27.731 --> 03:00:29.011]  We are in overdrive.
[03:00:29.231 --> 03:00:30.931]  We are still live on the air.
[03:00:31.011 --> 03:00:49.655]  If you are listening to this via YouTube or through PrisonPlanet.tv, the live stream, or Infowars.com forward slash show, and you want to hear it on radio in your area, and they don't carry the fourth hour, call your local radio station and ask them to carry the fourth hour if you want to see it on TV.
[03:00:50.755 --> 03:00:56.900]  Send your local TV program manager or TV station owner to InfoWars.com forward slash money bomb.
[03:00:56.920 --> 03:01:03.144]  We actually have a packet you can download there and has all the information on how to get our signal.
[03:01:03.445 --> 03:01:06.727]  We are launching this through satellite thanks to your help with the money bomb we had.
[03:01:07.868 --> 03:01:10.790]  I guess I was going to say last month but tomorrow it'll be last month.
[03:01:11.130 --> 03:01:12.351]  But there's the PDF right there.
[03:01:12.732 --> 03:01:14.053]  Got a lot of stuff we're going to cover.
[03:01:14.953 --> 03:01:27.039]  A lot of people send me emails about how can I get, how do I work for InfoWars, or how do I get an article on InfoWars, or how do I get a video on InfoWars, and I'm going to show you some ways that you can do that for people asking that question.
[03:01:27.059 --> 03:01:34.803]  I get a lot of that and I can't answer everybody's question, but I will give you some tips that I've learned and things that I see the people do that I like.
[03:01:35.183 --> 03:01:39.625]  I'm also going to cover Trump's tax plan and why I don't like it.
[03:01:40.425 --> 03:01:41.586]  I'll get into why I don't like it.
[03:01:43.007 --> 03:01:45.368]  And it's not because he's lowering taxes, I'll tell you that.
[03:01:46.429 --> 03:01:58.915]  Also, we're going to play a trailer from a longer interview we played last night on the InfoWars Nightly News, and the headline to that is, Survivors Expose How Sexual Predators Groom Their Victims.
[03:01:58.955 --> 03:02:11.701]  And this is two ladies who work for the Snap Network, and they talked about how they were abused as kids and how it happens, and how it's boys and girls that get abused in the church system.
[03:02:12.481 --> 03:02:13.722]  So that's something we're going to cover.
[03:02:14.782 --> 03:02:16.743]  But first I want to get to this article right here.
[03:02:16.803 --> 03:02:20.485]  InfoWars announces 2nd Amendment Flash Rally at UT Austin.
[03:02:20.505 --> 03:02:21.186]  This just went up.
[03:02:21.286 --> 03:02:24.187]  Alex just called about it if you were watching last hour.
[03:02:24.727 --> 03:02:28.789]  Join the counter-protest in support of the 2nd Amendment Thursday, October 1st at noon.
[03:02:28.829 --> 03:02:29.730]  That is tomorrow.
[03:02:30.250 --> 03:02:33.152]  West Mall at University of Texas in Austin.
[03:02:33.792 --> 03:02:46.814]  The Moms Demand Action is planning their gun-free UT anti-freedom rally at that very location at the same time, so we need to counter their establishment propaganda with our own pro-freedom, pro-Bill of Rights, pro-Second Amendment
[03:02:47.850 --> 03:02:49.151]  I added the pro-Second Amendment part.
[03:02:49.492 --> 03:02:52.715]  And that our individual liberties are worth fighting for.
[03:02:52.855 --> 03:02:54.257]  So get out there tomorrow.
[03:02:54.297 --> 03:02:55.398]  Joe Biggs is going to be out there.
[03:02:55.418 --> 03:03:00.484]  We're going to have at least two of our camera guys running live Skype.
[03:03:01.004 --> 03:03:02.085]  We'll be interviewing people.
[03:03:02.165 --> 03:03:03.647]  Hopefully we see a lot of people there.
[03:03:04.708 --> 03:03:09.152]  At this point, I am not positive if you can open carry at UT.
[03:03:09.452 --> 03:03:10.233]  We're looking into that.
[03:03:10.493 --> 03:03:17.378]  Joe Biggs is going to be on with Jakari Jackson tonight on the Nightly News to talk about that rally and they will most likely will have those answers.
[03:03:17.398 --> 03:03:20.821]  I've been in here actually, we call it traffic copping.
[03:03:22.242 --> 03:03:24.463]  Paul's signal was to go down, I was to jump right in.
[03:03:24.483 --> 03:03:30.045]  So I've been kind of standing by, reading stories, getting ready for this fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:03:30.065 --> 03:03:37.448]  I'm going to play a few videos, too, including one that was submitted, not even submitted for to play on our show.
[03:03:37.488 --> 03:03:38.928]  Somebody sent it to me via Twitter.
[03:03:39.008 --> 03:03:43.030]  I said, we need to put that up on InfoWars, because especially with flu season coming.
[03:03:43.070 --> 03:03:45.171]  So we're going to get into that in the next segment.
[03:03:46.141 --> 03:03:47.302]  I'm also going to talk about this.
[03:03:47.322 --> 03:03:56.269]  It's an article that came out on the Daily Mail a couple days ago talking about how the FBI is going to start making public information about police shootings of civilians.
[03:03:56.769 --> 03:04:01.053]  And while that on its surface seems like a really good idea, the guy behind it
[03:04:01.932 --> 03:04:04.153]  I don't like and I don't trust him at all, and that's Eric Holder.
[03:04:04.453 --> 03:04:05.254]  Why is he behind it?
[03:04:05.274 --> 03:04:06.194]  Well, I'm going to get into that.
[03:04:06.274 --> 03:04:16.059]  Why he's behind all that and why it's not... I mean, it's a good thing we see those statistics, but the reason they're posting them is not for open, transparent government.
[03:04:16.119 --> 03:04:20.322]  It's for more government, more government control and to federalize the police.
[03:04:20.382 --> 03:04:22.023]  So we're going to get into all that.
[03:04:23.663 --> 03:04:24.164]  Let's see.
[03:04:25.731 --> 03:04:27.934]  Here's an article that we posted.
[03:04:28.114 --> 03:04:29.235]  Somebody sent me an email.
[03:04:29.596 --> 03:04:31.578]  I watched some of the videos and said, let's post this.
[03:04:31.598 --> 03:04:34.982]  So I'll get into that right now while we have this last few minutes here, or this last minute.
[03:04:35.583 --> 03:04:38.887]  Scientists discover health breakthroughs from Russian space program.
[03:04:39.918 --> 03:04:49.987]  All right, and we're going to get more into that about the Russian space program and what it could tell us about our health because Russians were sending astronauts into space and they were coming back very healthy.
[03:04:50.367 --> 03:04:54.191]  Our astronauts are coming back on stretchers and there is a reason why.
[03:04:54.211 --> 03:04:57.174]  It's because they were really concerned about the health of their astronauts.
[03:04:57.194 --> 03:04:58.935]  So we'll get into all that and more.
[03:04:59.516 --> 03:05:02.218]  It's the fourth hour overdrive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:05:02.258 --> 03:05:03.279]  I'm your host Rob Duce.
[03:05:03.319 --> 03:05:03.920]  Stay tuned.
[03:05:09.255 --> 03:05:16.257]  A Georgia high school went into lockdown the other day after a student showed up with a confederate flag.
[03:05:16.697 --> 03:05:24.840]  The incident started when a 10th grade boy arrived at Rock Mart High School with the rebel flag attached to his backpack.
[03:05:25.200 --> 03:05:31.122]  He was then confronted by two black students who were upset by the flag and a fight broke out.
[03:05:34.386 --> 03:05:37.948]  The scuffle was quickly broken up by teachers and staff.
[03:05:38.348 --> 03:05:41.710]  All three students were searched and no weapons were found.
[03:05:42.010 --> 03:05:50.936]  But then rumors began to circulate that more students would be bringing Confederate flags to school and a campus lockdown was ordered.
[03:05:51.436 --> 03:05:56.819]  No word as to whether or not the black students are equally upset with President Barack Obama.
[03:05:57.039 --> 03:06:02.305]  Who also displayed the Confederate flag on his own campaign pin in 2012.
[03:06:02.925 --> 03:06:06.349]  And you can learn more at Infowars.com.
[03:06:09.119 --> 03:06:14.565]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[03:06:14.886 --> 03:06:29.342]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[03:06:29.582 --> 03:06:37.408]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[03:06:37.568 --> 03:06:43.032]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[03:06:43.152 --> 03:06:46.534]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[03:06:46.714 --> 03:06:50.697]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[03:06:50.857 --> 03:06:54.740]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[03:06:55.160 --> 03:06:59.163]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.
[03:06:59.283 --> 03:07:04.268]  Secure your Liver Shield today exclusively at Infowarslife.com for the lowest price available.

[03:07:08.991 --> 03:07:13.115]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[03:07:13.135 --> 03:07:14.556]  They are compounds.
[03:07:14.616 --> 03:07:15.036]  We're good to go.
[03:07:43.151 --> 03:07:48.634]  You're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[03:07:48.754 --> 03:07:51.956]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[03:07:52.056 --> 03:07:56.079]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[03:07:56.259 --> 03:07:58.380]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[03:07:58.560 --> 03:08:05.524]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:08:22.230 --> 03:08:28.293]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:08:30.014 --> 03:08:37.618]  All right, we are in the fourth hour.
[03:08:37.678 --> 03:08:38.518]  Thank you for joining me.
[03:08:38.538 --> 03:08:39.899]  I'm your host Rob Dew.
[03:08:40.808 --> 03:08:43.330]  We have a different host almost every day here on the 4th Hour.
[03:08:43.410 --> 03:08:46.693]  Give you a mix and mash of what's going on here at InfoWars.
[03:08:46.713 --> 03:08:51.938]  But before we go any further, and next, I'm going to tell you how to get your stuff on InfoWars.
[03:08:51.958 --> 03:08:53.980]  Because a lot of people send me a lot of emails.
[03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:58.544]  They want to know, they want critiques, they want reviews, they want to see their stuff on InfoWars.
[03:08:58.604 --> 03:09:00.246]  And we love to put your stuff on InfoWars.
[03:09:00.566 --> 03:09:04.508]  But before we get there, I want to tell you about two products that I've actually been taking the last couple days.
[03:09:04.828 --> 03:09:05.769]  The first one is Knockout.
[03:09:06.069 --> 03:09:09.871]  I take that because I like to stay awake till 2.30, sometimes 3 a.m.
[03:09:09.891 --> 03:09:12.853]  in the morning, and I don't wake up a really nice guy.
[03:09:13.013 --> 03:09:14.374]  Knockout, guys, not Brain Force.
[03:09:14.394 --> 03:09:15.514]  We'll go to that one in one second.
[03:09:15.554 --> 03:09:20.397]  Because in order to get to sleep, I take the Knockout around midnight.
[03:09:20.457 --> 03:09:24.699]  I think I'm going to start taking it around 11, because it works, and it works so well.
[03:09:26.124 --> 03:09:28.326]  I feel so good in the morning, I don't even want to get out of bed.
[03:09:28.527 --> 03:09:32.751]  I want to take an extra half hour of sleep, but it lets me sleep the entire night.
[03:09:32.791 --> 03:09:34.152]  I don't wake up in the middle of the night.
[03:09:35.213 --> 03:09:36.375]  Noises don't wake me up.
[03:09:36.815 --> 03:09:45.744]  My wife getting up out of bed to go to the bathroom doesn't wake me up because she's a pregnant female, which I guess I'm sexist for saying that, a pregnant woman.
[03:09:46.665 --> 03:09:47.606]  But in the morning,
[03:09:48.547 --> 03:09:50.769]  Even before I take coffee, I take Brain Force.
[03:09:51.229 --> 03:09:53.731]  And Brain Force, I didn't believe it.
[03:09:53.951 --> 03:09:56.273]  Anthony had been taking it and he said, you gotta take it, you gotta take it.
[03:09:56.413 --> 03:09:57.114]  I said, alright, fine.
[03:09:57.554 --> 03:10:00.657]  Yesterday, I took it for the first time.
[03:10:01.801 --> 03:10:21.899]  Unbelievable the results that I had I mean immediately my brain went from kind of foggy groggy to boom I'm awake I'm up I'm looking around I'm feeling good took it again this morning same exact results but not a jittery type of amped feeling you get like if you have too much coffee or too much herba mate or something brain force
[03:10:22.179 --> 03:10:29.683]  Let me tell you, that's a one-two punch to regulate your time schedule, because time is something we don't have a lot of.
[03:10:29.823 --> 03:10:34.225]  It is a finite resource, so we have to make the most of our time.
[03:10:34.245 --> 03:10:43.610]  And that is one way to do that, to keep your brain in focus when you need it to, and to help get the sleep to rest and recover that is equally as important.
[03:10:43.630 --> 03:10:46.492]  So I encourage you to try Brain Force and Knockout.
[03:10:46.912 --> 03:10:50.796]  Today at Infowarslife.com or Infowarsstore.com.
[03:10:50.816 --> 03:10:51.497]  You can check it out.
[03:10:51.537 --> 03:10:52.678]  You can read all the reviews.
[03:10:53.519 --> 03:10:54.359]  I encourage you to do that.
[03:10:54.419 --> 03:11:04.970]  Now, the International Academy for Regulatory Medicine and Consciousness Research contacted me via email and said, hey, are you interested in playing some videos that have some revolutionary health information?
[03:11:05.010 --> 03:11:07.652]  I said, well, I'm very interested in revolutionary health information.
[03:11:08.153 --> 03:11:08.633]  Send them over.
[03:11:09.054 --> 03:11:10.975]  Well, they sent them over and they were all in German.
[03:11:12.017 --> 03:11:13.657]  And, uh, but they have subtitles.
[03:11:14.017 --> 03:11:14.557]  Thank goodness.
[03:11:14.818 --> 03:11:18.858]  So usually I like to listen to videos while I'm doing other things because I have limited time.
[03:11:19.198 --> 03:11:21.999]  But these actually sat down, there's three videos that they sent me.
[03:11:22.059 --> 03:11:25.079]  I watched, uh, I've gone through part one and part of part two.
[03:11:25.599 --> 03:11:35.181]  And if you guys can bring up that article, it is titled, let's see here, Scientists Discover Health Breakthroughs from the Russian Space Program.
[03:11:36.581 --> 03:11:39.222]  And let me tell you, the Russians, they would send people up in space.
[03:11:40.882 --> 03:11:44.924]  The astronauts would come down, or cosmonauts would come down, and they would be able to do handstands.
[03:11:45.085 --> 03:11:48.467]  And our astronauts were in stretchers.
[03:11:48.487 --> 03:11:50.348]  They had to carry them out of the capsules.
[03:11:51.425 --> 03:12:00.553]  And there is a difference because the Russians were looking at the physiology and doing things different for their astronauts, providing them vitamins, enzymes and stuff to keep their bodies going.
[03:12:00.573 --> 03:12:04.055]  They were putting magnetic fields in their capsules, I think before the U.S.
[03:12:04.096 --> 03:12:07.438]  was, to regulate that pressure on the inside.
[03:12:08.299 --> 03:12:12.562]  So the two individuals there, one of them is Dr. Ettinger.
[03:12:13.890 --> 03:12:24.334]  They talk about all the different health breakthroughs they've been doing by studying the scientists that worked on the Russian space program and the things they came up with and now they're applying those today in Germany.
[03:12:24.734 --> 03:12:25.875]  So it's really interesting.
[03:12:25.915 --> 03:12:28.996]  If you're into health news, I encourage you to check out those three videos.
[03:12:29.176 --> 03:12:30.797]  I think they're amazing.
[03:12:31.397 --> 03:12:36.359]  I've sent them to a few people here in the office and they've all just been blown away by the information.
[03:12:36.399 --> 03:12:39.220]  A lot of it's validating stuff that I've thought personally.
[03:12:40.140 --> 03:12:50.989]  And it's just amazing to see other people thinking the same thing and that we're all on this journey together on earth and we're definitely not getting what we should be getting from mainstream media and Big Pharma.
[03:12:51.390 --> 03:12:53.291]  You know, Big Pharma wants to make you a lifelong customer.
[03:12:53.311 --> 03:13:00.817]  I'm into empowering people to, you know, not spend, you know, you don't want to spend all your money on health care and stuff like that now.
[03:13:01.792 --> 03:13:07.393]  I do want to take some calls, and that's 800-259-9231, specifically on this.
[03:13:07.513 --> 03:13:13.575]  There seems to be some controversy going on with the group trying to repeal SB 277.
[03:13:13.875 --> 03:13:17.956]  Here's the first article, Group Submit Signatures to Repeal California Vaccine Law.
[03:13:18.616 --> 03:13:22.217]  And this is the, they wanted to repeal SB 277, a group they needed 366,000 signatures
[03:13:25.638 --> 03:13:26.099]  That's a lot
[03:13:40.942 --> 03:13:51.555]  Donnelly said that the group has faced strong opposition from the pharmaceutical lobby and the referendum was sabotaged from without and within by powerful forces from its very inception.
[03:13:51.595 --> 03:13:58.064]  Never before in my political experience have I witnessed such extensive and determined opposition to a campaign, Donnelly said in a statement.
[03:13:58.504 --> 03:14:00.726]  I've got some tweets about this that people are sending me.
[03:14:00.766 --> 03:14:01.606]  We need to look into this.
[03:14:01.666 --> 03:14:11.574]  So if you have any information specifically about the signatures and what went wrong with SB 277 to get that repealed, please give me a call at 800-259-9231.
[03:14:12.194 --> 03:14:19.360]  At the conclusion of this segment, we have that short five-minute segment I would like to get you on to talk about it.
[03:14:20.706 --> 03:14:24.167]  Now, on to this next article.
[03:14:24.247 --> 03:14:27.547]  Top five videos you want to watch before you get your flu shot.
[03:14:27.587 --> 03:14:32.028]  We are in the midst of flu season, and they are going to be peppering you left and right.
[03:14:32.068 --> 03:14:36.089]  The banners have gone up at every CVS, every Walgreens in the country.
[03:14:36.409 --> 03:14:39.990]  To get your flu shot, you go into Randall's Grocery Store here locally.
[03:14:40.010 --> 03:14:45.031]  They want to give you 10% off your grocery bill if you just get jabbed with a little aluminum, a little mercury.
[03:14:45.591 --> 03:14:46.271]  Make you feel better.
[03:14:47.071 --> 03:14:48.991]  The top video on here is not one of ours, though.
[03:14:49.072 --> 03:14:57.894]  The other four are InfoWars produced videos, but the top one here is a report, the flu shot in pregnant women by an individual, he's a writer and researcher named Jeffrey Jackson.
[03:14:58.514 --> 03:15:04.035]  And he has taken our information, put it in his own video, and that's something that we encourage people to do.
[03:15:04.235 --> 03:15:06.956]  We encourage you to grab it from the different networks out there.
[03:15:06.996 --> 03:15:10.637]  We have PrisonPlanet.tv, where if you're a member, you can download the videos.
[03:15:10.697 --> 03:15:15.138]  If you're on our YouTube channel, you can download the videos there and use them in your own reports.
[03:15:15.638 --> 03:15:22.422]  Because we may put out a 40-minute video, and you may want to put out a 5-minute video on a certain subject that we touch on in a video, and we encourage you to do that.
[03:15:22.703 --> 03:15:23.963]  Well, that's what Mr. Jackson did.
[03:15:24.304 --> 03:15:25.424]  So I got with the writers today.
[03:15:25.444 --> 03:15:37.192]  I said, let's do a flu shot video montage article, and let's put his video on the top and see if we can get him some views, because it's very important that we all stand together on these core issues, especially of health freedom.
[03:15:37.492 --> 03:15:38.933]  So I want to play his report now.
[03:15:39.033 --> 03:15:40.154]  I don't know if I'm going to play the whole thing.
[03:15:40.174 --> 03:15:45.977]  I might cut out in parts of it, but you'll see where he actually grabs some of some of the content that we produced here at InfoWars.
[03:15:46.037 --> 03:15:47.078]  So roll that video.
[03:15:49.198 --> 03:15:53.821]  In 2006, the CDC's position regarding vaccinating pregnant mothers changed.
[03:15:54.041 --> 03:16:01.346]  Traditionally thought to be an unnecessary risk to the unborn child, the vaccinating of pregnant mothers opened the floodgates for new avenues of profit.
[03:16:01.486 --> 03:16:07.991]  The willful ignorance of a mainstream medical community forced rapid learning curves for parents attempting to protect their children.
[03:16:08.151 --> 03:16:15.616]  Doctors and scientists have been left shaking their heads in disbelief at the recklessness of this policy by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
[03:16:15.836 --> 03:16:18.538]  During pregnancy, they're warning women to get a flu shot.
[03:16:19.698 --> 03:16:22.539]  The flu shot then will be the priming shot.
[03:16:23.320 --> 03:16:25.441]  It primes the baby's microglia.
[03:16:26.681 --> 03:16:28.982]  Then at birth, get a hepatitis B shot.
[03:16:30.002 --> 03:16:30.983]  Overreaction.
[03:16:31.263 --> 03:16:33.964]  Then at two months, what happens to the poor baby?
[03:16:34.804 --> 03:16:38.886]  Well, you go to the pediatrician and say, well, time for six shots.
[03:16:39.426 --> 03:16:44.388]  Now that child's getting six times as high a dose of just adjuvant.
[03:16:45.889 --> 03:16:48.690]  Some of these vaccines have three different antigens in them.
[03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:54.143]  So now we're talking about dozens of immune stimulations.
[03:16:55.324 --> 03:16:56.285]  All in one city.
[03:16:56.545 --> 03:17:01.930]  Somewhere in the fog, injecting doctors and nurses following their superiors' orders lost the moral high ground.
[03:17:02.430 --> 03:17:14.760]  Ethics, informed consent, and humanity was lost in the rapid unconscious push to blindly keep up with ever-increasing vaccine schedules written by compromised regulatory agencies directed by drug company Profit.
[03:17:15.160 --> 03:17:36.335]  And you and I sat in a in a room with all of our on-call staff physicians and practitioners like oh wow this is so embarrassing this 25 weeker never actually required a breathing tube and going on the vent you know after he was born he was so strong but we gave him his two-month vaccinations and he got intubated last night haha how embarrassing like it's funny
[03:17:36.955 --> 03:17:44.121]  I mean, the step-down units are calling the NICU saying, hey, we're going to go ahead and give these four babies their two-month shots today.
[03:17:44.201 --> 03:17:55.331]  Make sure you have beds ready because we all know they're going to have increased breathing difficulty, feeding and digestion difficulty, apnea, you know, forgetting to breathe, and bradycardia.
[03:17:55.371 --> 03:17:56.492]  This is what goes on.
[03:17:57.296 --> 03:18:02.597]  Real journalism and voices for truth warning the public are historically low given what is at stake.
[03:18:02.777 --> 03:18:09.859]  The health of a new generation threatened by a massive PR push by news agencies who have fallen victim to drug company profit.
[03:18:10.279 --> 03:18:14.239]  Then you have the press, which again is compromised.
[03:18:14.259 --> 03:18:22.141]  I spoke to a news division president this week, I had breakfast with him, and he said that 70%
[03:18:23.064 --> 03:18:23.705]  We're good to go.
[03:18:39.096 --> 03:18:49.222]  The fact that you're injecting doctor or nurse does not speak about or even show you the actual vaccine insert is a violation of the ethics and laws governing medical... There you go.
[03:18:49.282 --> 03:18:51.043]  And there's the vaccine insert right there.
[03:18:51.063 --> 03:18:53.004]  And I encourage you to read the actual insert.
[03:18:53.064 --> 03:18:54.845]  It says it hasn't been tested right there.
[03:18:55.186 --> 03:18:57.287]  Has not been established for pregnant women or nursing mothers.
[03:18:57.607 --> 03:18:58.928]  Right there in writing.
[03:18:59.508 --> 03:19:02.489]  Yet they sit there and market it towards pregnant women.
[03:19:02.529 --> 03:19:05.089]  That is their untapped market right now is pregnant women.
[03:19:05.429 --> 03:19:09.691]  And you notice it's not even 10 years old that they've been saying pregnant women should be getting their flu shot.
[03:19:10.231 --> 03:19:10.951]  It's despicable.
[03:19:11.131 --> 03:19:12.091]  And people write about it.
[03:19:12.111 --> 03:19:12.831]  Do you see that article?
[03:19:13.872 --> 03:19:16.292]  Pregnancy is the best time to get your vaccines.
[03:19:17.272 --> 03:19:19.133]  I mean, these people are psychotic.
[03:19:20.236 --> 03:19:21.197]  They are psychotic.
[03:19:21.537 --> 03:19:26.361]  So to watch the rest of that, you can go to the article, Top 5 Videos to Watch Before You Get Your Flu Shot.
[03:19:26.441 --> 03:19:27.141]  Pass that around.
[03:19:27.181 --> 03:19:29.403]  People love Top 5, Top 10 lists.
[03:19:29.944 --> 03:19:32.425]  And we could have put a better headline on there.
[03:19:32.465 --> 03:19:35.228]  I don't really like Top 5, Top 10 headlines.
[03:19:35.428 --> 03:19:36.308]  But people read those.
[03:19:36.649 --> 03:19:37.529]  And people watch those.
[03:19:37.569 --> 03:19:39.191]  So maybe they'll watch some of these.
[03:19:39.251 --> 03:19:41.653]  There's some other great videos there.
[03:19:42.771 --> 03:19:46.553]  We had Leanne McAdoo go ahead and pose as a pregnant lady and they were pushing the flu shot on her.
[03:19:46.953 --> 03:19:47.434]  It was crazy.
[03:19:47.454 --> 03:19:52.656]  We're going to be back with more and hopefully I'll take some of these calls here on SB 277 on the referendum.
[03:19:52.676 --> 03:19:54.817]  This is Rob Dew and you're watching the Alex Jones Show.

[03:22:09.147 --> 03:22:19.738]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?

[03:22:24.223 --> 03:22:26.025]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:22:26.345 --> 03:22:31.831]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.

[03:22:53.915 --> 03:22:57.016]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.

[03:23:08.740 --> 03:23:16.103]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[03:23:16.403 --> 03:23:19.305]  that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.
[03:23:19.805 --> 03:23:23.567]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[03:24:14.582 --> 03:24:24.044]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side
[03:24:27.268 --> 03:24:31.291]  I have a couple callers, specifically about SB 277, which is in California.
[03:24:31.391 --> 03:24:34.693]  Interestingly enough, both callers, one's from New York and one's from New Jersey.
[03:24:34.773 --> 03:24:37.855]  So I'd like to see some callers from California call in.
[03:24:37.875 --> 03:24:39.216]  You got a couple minutes here.
[03:24:39.236 --> 03:24:40.877]  I'm going to take calls in this segment.
[03:24:42.178 --> 03:24:49.503]  But as I was playing the video before about how they want to push the flu vaccine on pregnant women... I'm Atofopaw.
[03:24:49.523 --> 03:24:49.983]  I'm sorry.
[03:24:50.063 --> 03:24:54.526]  Trannies now want me to say birthing individual instead of pregnant woman.
[03:24:56.167 --> 03:24:57.448]  So that's from Kit Daniels.
[03:24:57.528 --> 03:25:03.734]  Transsexuals want you to use the phrase birthing individuals instead of pregnant women because according to them, the latter promotes trans hatred.
[03:25:04.554 --> 03:25:05.355]  I did not know that.
[03:25:05.375 --> 03:25:06.836]  I have no hatred towards anybody.
[03:25:09.258 --> 03:25:14.903]  LGBT activists have convinced the Midwives Alliance of North America to stop referring to their clients as women and mothers.
[03:25:15.344 --> 03:25:20.468]  Instead, call them pregnant people and birthing individuals so transsexuals won't get offended.
[03:25:22.149 --> 03:25:22.450]  Well...
[03:25:24.036 --> 03:25:25.557]  Pregnant women, pregnant women, pregnant women.
[03:25:26.117 --> 03:25:26.878]  Hope that didn't offend you.
[03:25:27.278 --> 03:25:28.179]  Here's another quick tip.
[03:25:28.779 --> 03:25:32.581]  When you send us video, don't hold your phone like this.
[03:25:33.562 --> 03:25:36.924]  Turn your phone this way, and then shoot the video.
[03:25:37.985 --> 03:25:42.067]  If you turn it this way, you're gonna send me a little video in a big screen.
[03:25:42.928 --> 03:25:44.169]  I've had a couple people do it.
[03:25:44.209 --> 03:25:44.749]  They send me videos.
[03:25:44.769 --> 03:25:45.990]  They're like, what do you think of this video?
[03:25:46.010 --> 03:25:48.231]  And I say, first thing, just turn your camera this way.
[03:25:48.972 --> 03:25:49.552]  And I'm serious.
[03:25:49.712 --> 03:25:50.613]  It makes a big difference.
[03:25:51.752 --> 03:25:52.653]  Check it out for yourself.
[03:25:52.713 --> 03:25:54.774]  Do your own research to that online.
[03:25:55.075 --> 03:26:00.259]  And while I was looking at that, Jeffrey Jackson, the guy who we played his video earlier, sent me an article.
[03:26:00.699 --> 03:26:04.182]  CDC spends $1 million to increase adult flu vaccination rates.
[03:26:04.682 --> 03:26:05.983]  Flu shot to be mandatory.
[03:26:06.003 --> 03:26:07.565]  You guys can get that there on my phone.
[03:26:08.465 --> 03:26:08.986]  There it is.
[03:26:09.246 --> 03:26:14.590]  So they're spending a lot of money to make sure you take that flu shot because they're really concerned about your health.
[03:26:15.251 --> 03:26:15.471]  Right?
[03:26:17.152 --> 03:26:20.554]  That's why they want to make it mandatory because they want to make sure you're healthy.
[03:26:20.754 --> 03:26:22.475]  They really care about you so much.
[03:26:22.495 --> 03:26:24.036]  It has nothing to do with the money they make.
[03:26:24.736 --> 03:26:25.516]  No, that's all.
[03:26:26.117 --> 03:26:29.198]  So, Alex, in New York, you're on the line.
[03:26:29.398 --> 03:26:31.319]  What do you have to say about SB 277?
[03:26:33.160 --> 03:26:33.680]  Hi, Rob.
[03:26:34.061 --> 03:26:35.842]  I'm actually from California.
[03:26:36.862 --> 03:26:38.583]  I'm in New York right now.
[03:26:39.103 --> 03:26:46.387]  But I wanted to say how we avoided vaccinating my sister to go to school.
[03:26:47.193 --> 03:26:49.134]  And how we plan to do it in the future, too.
[03:26:49.194 --> 03:26:51.855]  And all my cousins and relatives, they're doing the same thing.
[03:26:53.455 --> 03:26:59.318]  I realize by saying this, it's going to kind of put a... Probably the system knows this.
[03:26:59.358 --> 03:27:05.240]  But anyways, we basically got the doctor, our family doctor, to just say that he vaccinated.
[03:27:05.260 --> 03:27:06.820]  He signed on the form.
[03:27:07.581 --> 03:27:10.382]  And it's basically we lied.
[03:27:10.902 --> 03:27:11.202]  Wow.
[03:27:12.343 --> 03:27:15.784]  You committed a crime against the vaccine community.
[03:27:17.228 --> 03:27:20.589]  I think they're committing a crime, so we've got to fight back.
[03:27:20.849 --> 03:27:22.170]  Exactly, we've got to protect ourselves.
[03:27:22.190 --> 03:27:22.510]  You're right.
[03:27:22.530 --> 03:27:22.830]  Go ahead.
[03:27:23.810 --> 03:27:41.156]  But as far as the signatures, me and my family members, we went out to sign them, and as far as from what I understood was very hard was they had specific locations to go and sign, and so it made it very difficult.
[03:27:41.216 --> 03:27:45.258]  Like, you had to go and get out of your way to go and sign the
[03:27:46.221 --> 03:27:59.714]  The petition and you have to like look for places and it was very like bizarre I usually very easy to sign the petition in California but this time it was like you had to go way out of your way into some part of LA or whatever.
[03:28:00.202 --> 03:28:07.110]  Yeah, Mark Dice could have probably got all 366,000 signatures if it was something like ban the Bill of Rights or ban the Bible.
[03:28:07.131 --> 03:28:15.381]  It had plenty of people signing, but yeah, I'm interested to see what went on with SB 277 because I thought that would be a slam dunk.
[03:28:15.401 --> 03:28:18.504]  There was enough protest and outcry from a lot of different
[03:28:19.105 --> 03:28:20.426]  Nation of Islam.
[03:28:47.327 --> 03:28:48.748]  Nation of Islam, that's what it is.
[03:28:48.948 --> 03:28:49.689]  Thanks, CJ.
[03:28:50.270 --> 03:28:52.591]  Mary in New Jersey, go ahead.
[03:28:52.752 --> 03:28:54.533]  What do you have to say?
[03:28:54.553 --> 03:29:05.702]  Hi, I've been a nurse all my life, working in ICUs and education, and most doctors, like Ben Carson, is there, who's running for office?
[03:29:06.023 --> 03:29:06.763]  He's a surgeon.
[03:29:07.324 --> 03:29:10.466]  They're not aware of the controversy.
[03:29:10.506 --> 03:29:11.587]  They're not aware.
[03:29:11.607 --> 03:29:16.071]  They just accept whatever is in the PBR, usually.
[03:29:17.097 --> 03:29:23.543]  I'm supposed to not become aware of this stuff, so basically that's what I wanted to say.
[03:29:23.939 --> 03:29:32.485]  Yeah, I had to actually go and, because my wife was kind of on the fence about vaccination many years ago, and I had to actually debate my doctor.
[03:29:32.525 --> 03:29:43.192]  So I went in with an army of documents, and at the end, she threw up her arms and said, you sure did your research, and said, I'm still going to support vaccination, but I respect your decision, and you're definitely informed.
[03:29:43.472 --> 03:29:44.773]  So inform yourself, people.
[03:29:45.133 --> 03:29:45.734]  It's your job.
[03:29:45.774 --> 03:29:46.594]  It's not the doctor's job.
[03:29:46.614 --> 03:29:47.455]  It's not Big Pharma's job.
[03:29:47.515 --> 03:29:48.335]  It's your job.
[03:29:49.216 --> 03:29:51.998]  We'll be right back with the Alex Jones Show and the Overdrive Hours with Rob Duke.
[03:29:58.430 --> 03:30:01.432]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.353 --> 03:30:05.155]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.399 --> 03:30:12.381]  This article from Medical Express appeared on the Drudge Report.
[03:30:12.501 --> 03:30:15.624]  Chemical exposure linked to rising diabetes obesity risk.
[03:30:15.924 --> 03:30:23.210]  Emerging evidence ties endocrine disrupting chemical exposure to two of the biggest public health threats facing society, diabetes and obesity.
[03:30:23.350 --> 03:30:26.032]  And that's according to a statement issued by the Endocrine Society.
[03:30:26.192 --> 03:30:35.858]  The statement builds upon the Society's groundbreaking 2009 report, which examines the state of scientific evidence on endocrine-disrupting chemicals, or EDCs, and the risk posed to human health.
[03:30:36.118 --> 03:30:41.981]  I made a search using two words, InfoWars and BPA, and was astounded by the number of times we've covered this subject.
[03:30:42.081 --> 03:30:49.926]  Mounting evidence also indicates that EDC exposure is connected to infertility, hormone-related cancers, neurological issues, and other disorders.
[03:30:50.166 --> 03:30:59.075]  EDCs do this by blocking or otherwise interfering with the body's natural hormones and hijacking the body's chemical messengers, and they can alter the way cells develop and grow.
[03:30:59.315 --> 03:31:01.778]  All things we've been telling you here at InfoWars.com.

[03:31:04.981 --> 03:31:07.423]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:31:09.153 --> 03:31:10.393]  Another major health threat.
[03:31:10.413 --> 03:31:15.314]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[03:31:15.374 --> 03:31:18.035]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[03:31:18.075 --> 03:31:24.836]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[03:31:25.116 --> 03:31:27.977]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[03:31:28.097 --> 03:31:31.037]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[03:31:31.117 --> 03:31:33.037]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[03:31:33.077 --> 03:31:35.878]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[03:31:35.998 --> 03:31:41.501]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[03:31:41.721 --> 03:31:45.203]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[03:31:45.223 --> 03:31:48.225]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[03:31:48.325 --> 03:31:55.429]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[03:32:05.555 --> 03:32:06.155]  We're good to go.
[03:32:29.790 --> 03:32:32.692]  Cutting-edge technique that is free of toxic artificial additives.
[03:32:33.193 --> 03:32:40.638]  Infowarslife.com developed Silver Bullet by closely working with one of the top silver manufacturing labs in the United States.
[03:32:41.018 --> 03:32:44.361]  We set out to bring you the very best at the lowest price.

[03:32:49.665 --> 03:32:53.728]  In these times, it's essential to have high-quality, loyal silver on hand.
[03:32:54.088 --> 03:32:56.910]  No survival chest is complete without Silver Bullet.
[03:32:57.130 --> 03:32:58.191]  Exclusively available
[03:32:58.351 --> 03:33:01.753]  Everybody who knows me knows that I get emotional about certain things.
[03:33:01.973 --> 03:33:03.593]  And I think the top of our list
[03:33:22.279 --> 03:33:26.240]  It's providing for the safety and security of the American people.
[03:33:26.381 --> 03:33:28.201]  When are we going to defeat them?
[03:33:28.301 --> 03:33:28.761]  No, no.
[03:33:28.881 --> 03:33:29.622]  Not my nose.
[03:33:29.682 --> 03:33:31.402]  No, it's not.
[03:33:31.442 --> 03:33:40.125]  What set you off that time?
[03:33:40.165 --> 03:33:45.627]  Making sure that these kids have a shot at the American dream.
[03:33:46.768 --> 03:33:47.248]  My God.
[03:33:48.569 --> 03:33:49.729]  It's important.
[03:33:59.392 --> 03:34:03.174]  I put my... myself through school.
[03:34:05.716 --> 03:34:08.577]  Working every rotten job there was.
[03:34:09.198 --> 03:34:11.679]  I wanted to make sure every kid had the same chance in life.
[03:34:12.900 --> 03:34:14.381]  Good luck.
[03:34:15.782 --> 03:34:17.523]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:17.983 --> 03:34:19.424]  Because there is a war on.
[03:34:19.944 --> 03:34:20.785]  For your mind.
[03:34:21.860 --> 03:34:23.001]  Oh my gosh, he's going to start crying.
[03:34:24.501 --> 03:34:25.802]  Put him back on screen.
[03:34:26.662 --> 03:34:29.283]  I certainly don't want the institution to go through this.
[03:34:30.604 --> 03:34:31.824]  He's got the tissue out.
[03:34:33.185 --> 03:34:33.965]  That's right.
[03:34:34.265 --> 03:34:38.307]  Where's Boner going to go from here now that he's reached the pinnacle of hog troughery?
[03:34:38.807 --> 03:34:46.711]  He has been feeding off the public trough for many years and now he gets his cushy retirement and cushy pay for the rest of his life and his free health care.
[03:34:46.771 --> 03:34:48.892]  He really gets free health care paid for by you and me.
[03:34:48.912 --> 03:34:50.973]  I don't know why he's crying.
[03:34:52.042 --> 03:34:53.564]  Maybe it's some skeletons in the closet.
[03:34:53.685 --> 03:34:54.446]  Maybe we'll never know.
[03:34:54.466 --> 03:34:56.930]  Took a while for Hastert's skeletons.
[03:34:56.970 --> 03:34:59.934]  He was the longest reigning Republican speaker for his skeletons.
[03:34:59.954 --> 03:35:00.776]  They're starting to come out.
[03:35:01.437 --> 03:35:04.602]  Seems like he was a wrestling coach that liked to bring little boys on trips.
[03:35:05.643 --> 03:35:07.106]  And people are speaking out now.
[03:35:08.370 --> 03:35:11.111]  I want to jump over to Trump's tax plan.
[03:35:11.591 --> 03:35:12.171]  Fact check.
[03:35:12.191 --> 03:35:12.931]  This is from Yahoo.
[03:35:13.371 --> 03:35:16.172]  Math and Trump's tax plan doesn't always add up.
[03:35:16.872 --> 03:35:22.854]  And they're going on and on about how the tax plan is going to take away too much from the trough eaters.
[03:35:23.734 --> 03:35:26.875]  The tax cuts will be nearly $12 trillion over the next decade.
[03:35:26.895 --> 03:35:28.135]  Well, we can't have that.
[03:35:28.636 --> 03:35:30.136]  What would the tax trough people do?
[03:35:30.456 --> 03:35:31.736]  What would the trough eaters do?
[03:35:31.796 --> 03:35:34.237]  How would they regurgitate all this?
[03:35:34.277 --> 03:35:34.677]  Look at that.
[03:35:35.317 --> 03:35:37.018]  $12 trillion in the deficit.
[03:35:37.694 --> 03:35:40.138]  He wants to get rid of the inheritance tax.
[03:35:40.980 --> 03:35:44.085]  He wants to get rid of the different rates.
[03:35:44.125 --> 03:35:46.349]  He wants to cut, I think there were seven levels of taxes.
[03:35:46.389 --> 03:35:47.370]  He wants to cut them down to four.
[03:35:48.953 --> 03:35:59.943]  But what I like about what Trump did say about his tax plan is that he wants to go after waste, citing the example of hammers that cost $800 that you can buy in a store for a tiny amount of money, a musty reference that dates to the 80s Pentagon scandal.
[03:36:00.363 --> 03:36:02.905]  He also poked fun at the government-funded soccer field that cost a million.
[03:36:03.446 --> 03:36:11.473]  To make up the deficit, Trump would need to eliminate improper or insufficiently documented payments made by the federal government, estimated by the GAO office to be $124 billion in 2014.
[03:36:14.761 --> 03:36:19.686]  So, the government wastes, just in one year alone, $124 billion.
[03:36:20.747 --> 03:36:27.873]  Now, Yahoo didn't really like his tax plan, because I guess the people that work for Yahoo think that we should be taxed to the hilt so we can have free stuff.
[03:36:28.734 --> 03:36:32.898]  Like our, we had a guest here earlier, he said he liked free healthcare, but not like high taxes.
[03:36:33.418 --> 03:36:35.760]  And you're paying for the free healthcare, buddy, you just don't get it.
[03:36:37.282 --> 03:36:39.364]  Donald Trump's amazingly conventional tax plan
[03:36:40.660 --> 03:36:43.862]  The top marginal income rate would drop to 25% from nearly 40%.
[03:36:43.922 --> 03:36:47.685]  Middle income earners would pay 10-20%.
[03:36:47.765 --> 03:36:51.788]  Anyone earning less than $25,000 a year or $50,000 for married couples would pay no tax at all.
[03:36:52.509 --> 03:36:55.851]  Trump would scratch the marriage penalty, estate tax, and the alternative minimum tax.
[03:36:56.192 --> 03:36:59.894]  And businesses would pay no more than 15% of their income to the government.
[03:37:00.495 --> 03:37:01.296]  Why is that important?
[03:37:01.396 --> 03:37:03.958]  Well, U.S.
[03:37:03.978 --> 03:37:08.221]  companies are stashing $2.1 trillion overseas to avoid taxes.
[03:37:09.929 --> 03:37:16.751]  Now if my tax plan would be everybody pays 10% and that's for everything.
[03:37:16.791 --> 03:37:22.133]  You don't have property tax, you don't have all these little fees and taxes that sales tax, nothing.
[03:37:22.553 --> 03:37:26.255]  10% and if the government can't live on that, well then they've got to cut expenses.
[03:37:26.655 --> 03:37:32.977]  And I think the first place to start is by cutting expenses on those exorbitant salaries that our senators and congressmen make.
[03:37:34.056 --> 03:37:35.037]  They're public servants.
[03:37:35.838 --> 03:37:37.640]  If they don't like it, they can always leave.
[03:37:37.680 --> 03:37:43.065]  There's plenty of other people that want to come in and get free health care and a free office up in Washington, D.C.
[03:37:43.846 --> 03:37:46.068]  Let's start cutting where it hurts.
[03:37:46.148 --> 03:37:52.575]  Let's start cutting some of these salaries of some of these bureaucrats, these lifetime bureaucrats that are making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
[03:37:54.281 --> 03:37:55.122]  It's public service.
[03:37:56.102 --> 03:37:58.604]  It should not be a place where you go camp out for the rest of your life.
[03:37:58.824 --> 03:38:02.426]  These people need to go into the real world and see what it's like and get a real job.
[03:38:03.367 --> 03:38:03.927]  $2.1 trillion.
[03:38:04.008 --> 03:38:09.651]  If we were getting 10% of that, that's $210 billion right there, just on the overseas money that they're hiding.
[03:38:09.972 --> 03:38:11.613]  Then you got another $124 billion that the GAO admitted is wasted.
[03:38:11.633 --> 03:38:13.734]  So that's $334 billion without even taxing anybody.
[03:38:24.953 --> 03:38:26.915]  Any American citizen right there.
[03:38:27.295 --> 03:38:30.218]  Just on those two savings alone.
[03:38:30.378 --> 03:38:32.740]  You can start there and then you tax everybody else at 10%.
[03:38:33.120 --> 03:38:34.381]  You get rid of the property tax.
[03:38:34.662 --> 03:38:35.983]  You get rid of all these other taxes.
[03:38:36.003 --> 03:38:40.307]  You get rid of all this bureaucratic state government, local governments.
[03:38:41.388 --> 03:38:43.269]  And you put the pedal to the metal.
[03:38:43.570 --> 03:38:44.831]  But we have to do that.
[03:38:44.891 --> 03:38:46.092]  We have to step up and do that.
[03:38:46.112 --> 03:38:49.054]  And if your people are paying less taxes, guess what they're going to do?
[03:38:49.335 --> 03:38:50.255]  They're going to spend more.
[03:38:51.038 --> 03:38:52.719]  And which is going to stimulate the economy.
[03:38:52.979 --> 03:38:54.740]  They're going to hire more if they're a business owner.
[03:38:55.300 --> 03:38:59.662]  And they're going to pay those people more, which is going to mean more taxes to the hog trough.
[03:39:01.063 --> 03:39:02.123]  Then that's what needs to happen.
[03:39:02.784 --> 03:39:09.507]  If we could get it down to 10% for everybody, we would have the greatest country the world has ever seen 10 times over.
[03:39:09.567 --> 03:39:12.088]  And we would have money to do all the things we want to do.
[03:39:12.128 --> 03:39:14.510]  We'd be able to pay for all the health care for all the people.
[03:39:15.610 --> 03:39:16.931]  Yeah, some things are going to get cut.
[03:39:17.731 --> 03:39:20.493]  And we need to take a look at it and go, what do we really need to fund?
[03:39:20.513 --> 03:39:24.035]  What does the federal government, what does the state government, what does the local government really need to fund?
[03:39:24.835 --> 03:39:29.338]  And then everything else we put in the private sector and we let the private sector decide what really needs to be funded.
[03:39:30.699 --> 03:39:31.239]  And we'll see.
[03:39:32.239 --> 03:39:37.182]  We'll see if giant sports stadiums for high school kids is the proper way to spend money.
[03:39:38.363 --> 03:39:43.326]  Or we'll see if a million dollar soccer fields for the federal government is the right way to spend money.
[03:39:44.488 --> 03:39:46.550]  Now I want to go to these two articles.
[03:40:04.258 --> 03:40:04.438]  I agree.
[03:40:04.478 --> 03:40:05.538]  It's definitely a matter of common sense.
[03:40:05.558 --> 03:40:09.680]  We need to know how this is used so we can look at our police objectively and decide how they're doing their job locally.
[03:40:10.380 --> 03:40:12.581]  But why is the federal government pushing for this?
[03:40:12.621 --> 03:40:13.561]  Why is Eric Holder pushing for this?
[03:40:31.323 --> 03:40:32.404]  Well, it's out in USA Today.
[03:40:33.064 --> 03:40:35.766]  Feds returning to local crime fight.
[03:40:35.826 --> 03:40:39.009]  That's right, the feds are concerned about the local crime.
[03:40:39.849 --> 03:40:42.231]  Mining concern over recent violent crime surges in U.S.
[03:40:42.251 --> 03:40:43.272]  cities has prompted the U.S.
[03:40:43.312 --> 03:40:52.779]  Justice Department to call a meeting next month of more than a dozen law enforcement officials to deal with persistent public safety threats ranging from criminal gangs to domestic violence.
[03:40:53.900 --> 03:40:58.163]  Earlier this year, in the face of rising tensions between police and public communities across the nation,
[03:40:58.857 --> 03:41:00.698]  Which was kind of funded by the White House?
[03:41:16.850 --> 03:41:26.617]  We saw how Baltimore turned out, and there were riots, and now there's the murder rate skyrocketed because police don't want to do their job because they're afraid of being called out and investigated.
[03:41:27.358 --> 03:41:29.039]  And it's a two-way street with police.
[03:41:29.239 --> 03:41:39.867]  If they didn't spend their time harassing people for meaningless crimes, and I'm not saying they're all doing that, and racial profiling and stuff that does happen, maybe they wouldn't have this community backlash.
[03:41:40.187 --> 03:41:43.590]  And shooting people that are unarmed, I was looking at a video earlier of a guy who was
[03:41:44.190 --> 03:41:47.615]  Leaning against the car like this and the cop just pulled out his taser and tased the guy.
[03:41:48.036 --> 03:41:49.357]  There's no reason to do that.
[03:41:54.377 --> 03:42:08.467]  On Monday, the federal government's identified five cities, Compton, California, Little Rock, Arkansas, West Memphis, Arkansas, Newark, New Jersey, and Flint, Michigan, which are poised to get an infusion of federal help to battle violence, even as most of the country has enjoyed relative calm.
[03:42:09.168 --> 03:42:14.431]  All those cities are run by Democratic mayors, so I wonder why they need federal help.
[03:42:14.732 --> 03:42:19.615]  Maybe it's because they have draconian gun laws, so people aren't armed, so the criminals run rampant.
[03:42:21.297 --> 03:42:33.164]  And they talk about in this article how Chicago, Detroit, Camden, New Jersey, Oakland, and Wilmington, Delaware, which I'm not sure about Wilmington, Delaware, but I bet it's a Democratic mayor.
[03:42:33.564 --> 03:42:34.905]  They've addressed similar problems.
[03:42:34.925 --> 03:42:36.365]  The Justice Department had to go in there and look.
[03:42:36.665 --> 03:42:39.507]  This is about the federal government wanting to come in and control the police.
[03:42:39.967 --> 03:42:44.050]  That is why they want to release this data, so they can say, look, police, they're not doing their job.
[03:42:44.150 --> 03:42:45.170]  We need to come in and help.
[03:42:45.210 --> 03:42:46.911]  And what happens when they come in and help?
[03:42:47.351 --> 03:42:49.713]  You get what you get in Chicago, which is lots of murders,
[03:42:50.646 --> 03:42:55.508]  Really high gun control and citizens and police that are afraid to do their job.
[03:42:57.049 --> 03:42:59.530]  So, there's that.
[03:43:00.210 --> 03:43:01.631]  Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[03:43:03.463 --> 03:43:05.965]  Here's an article that we put up this morning.
[03:43:06.065 --> 03:43:10.108]  Survivors expose how sexual predators groom their victims.
[03:43:10.208 --> 03:43:14.972]  And this is an interview that David Knight and Jakari Jackson did while they were following around the Pope.
[03:43:15.012 --> 03:43:18.794]  There were two ladies that were also following around the Pope.
[03:43:19.054 --> 03:43:20.055]  They were from SNAP.
[03:43:20.095 --> 03:43:23.958]  It's an independent confidential network of survivors of institutional sexual abuse.
[03:43:25.339 --> 03:43:29.102]  And I'm going to play a three minute trailer from that right now.
[03:43:30.430 --> 03:43:34.954]  And when we come back, if we have time, I may get to another video, or we'll see where we go from here.
[03:43:35.415 --> 03:43:40.279]  We got John in Michigan wants to talk about SV40, so maybe we'll talk with him as well.
[03:43:40.559 --> 03:43:41.800]  But let's go to that video.
[03:43:41.820 --> 03:43:48.787]  This is a trailer of the longer video, which you can find the longer video in that article, Survivors Expose How Sexual Predators Groom Their Victims.
[03:43:48.807 --> 03:43:49.868]  Let's roll the video.
[03:43:56.667 --> 03:44:06.094]  I was abused by a priest as a child, but as a teacher in my parish grade school, I caught the associate pastor in the act of molesting a child.
[03:44:07.095 --> 03:44:10.878]  I know he's been caught four times, and yet he's still in a parish today.
[03:44:10.898 --> 03:44:12.640]  I was abused as a child.
[03:44:13.300 --> 03:44:20.309]  From the ages of 9 to 11 by a priest in Alexandria, Virginia, who was a newly ordained priest.
[03:44:20.410 --> 03:44:23.213]  He came to our house and he kind of adopted our family.
[03:44:23.714 --> 03:44:24.875]  He ate dinner with us.
[03:44:24.935 --> 03:44:26.518]  He went on vacation with us.
[03:44:27.819 --> 03:44:30.363]  He became like a member of the family and I loved him.
[03:44:30.783 --> 03:44:31.523]  And I adored him.
[03:44:31.844 --> 03:44:34.145]  And he used that to start abusing me.
[03:44:34.585 --> 03:44:38.007]  SNAP is Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.
[03:44:38.307 --> 03:44:40.168]  It was founded in Chicago in 1988.
[03:44:41.268 --> 03:44:48.532]  And at that point, the founder, Barbara Blaine, thought there were a few dozen clergy sex abuse survivors, and she was reaching out to them.
[03:44:49.052 --> 03:44:51.013]  This pope has done what Pope Benedict did.
[03:44:51.133 --> 03:44:52.234]  He said a lot of things.
[03:44:52.634 --> 03:44:55.335]  You know, he said, we're not going to tolerate bishops abusing.
[03:44:55.395 --> 03:44:57.255]  We're not going to tolerate priests abusing.
[03:44:57.795 --> 03:45:03.456]  That, how sad he is that victims were abused and that children were harmed.
[03:45:03.876 --> 03:45:05.777]  But the key word is he said.
[03:45:06.617 --> 03:45:08.117]  And, you know, he needs to do.
[03:45:08.657 --> 03:45:10.238]  And that's the thing I think we're missing.
[03:45:10.418 --> 03:45:17.479]  The archbishop during the last grand jury investigation, and there have been two here in Philadelphia, Justin Regali.
[03:45:17.899 --> 03:45:24.842]  When the grand jury report was handed down, I believe there were 37 predators still in ministry.
[03:45:25.642 --> 03:45:35.987]  And through the grand jury and the trials of Monsignor Lynn, who was convicted of knowingly moving child predators and endangering children, and he is in prison for that part he played.
[03:45:36.707 --> 03:45:37.848]  But Cardinal Bregali
[03:45:38.994 --> 03:45:39.975]  Quietly resigned.
[03:45:40.115 --> 03:45:44.958]  He's living a life completely, he hasn't lost his title, hasn't lost his paycheck.
[03:45:45.558 --> 03:45:50.521]  And this weekend, we've noticed him in the front pew, here, at all the festivities.
[03:45:50.781 --> 03:45:54.143]  He's being honored, and yet he left in disgrace.
[03:45:54.823 --> 03:46:04.649]  So to us, the message is, if you protect the predators, if you keep the church a secret, if you keep the lid on the scandal, you'll be rewarded, not you'll be held accountable.
[03:46:05.289 --> 03:46:08.050]  Child predators aren't the dirty old men hiding in the bushes.
[03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:13.932]  Child predators are charming, they're charismatic, they do many, many good things, and they help many kids.
[03:46:14.592 --> 03:46:18.394]  But that doesn't mean they're not raping other children.
[03:46:18.854 --> 03:46:21.435]  So you can't paint a predator as black or white.
[03:46:21.615 --> 03:46:26.796]  Because, you know, the Pope's not taking action, one thing we want to have happen is we'd like the federal government to take action.
[03:46:27.156 --> 03:46:29.097]  We'd like them to investigate these crimes.
[03:46:29.377 --> 03:46:34.039]  We've seen that happen in Australia, and Belgium, and Ireland.
[03:46:35.079 --> 03:46:35.720]  In Canada.
[03:46:36.160 --> 03:46:46.005]  And so we'd like to see the federal government investigate these crimes and make the Pope release these documents, like everyone else has done.
[03:46:46.345 --> 03:46:54.510]  The Catholic Church admits there's about 6,500 credibly accused priests in the United States alone.
[03:46:55.951 --> 03:47:04.318]  We did some math and the Catholic Church also in 2012 said they believe there were about a hundred thousand clergy abuse victims in the United States.
[03:47:04.998 --> 03:47:09.322]  And if you do the math of the United States is six percent of the world's population.
[03:47:10.042 --> 03:47:14.406]  That would give you 1.5 million clergy abuse victims in the world.
[03:47:18.890 --> 03:47:22.012]  So you can catch the rest of that amazing interview
[03:47:23.098 --> 03:47:24.198]  And what is the Pope doing?
[03:47:24.438 --> 03:47:26.539]  Well, first of all, I'll give you that headline again.
[03:47:26.559 --> 03:47:29.820]  Survivors Exposed How Sexual Predators Groom Their Victims.
[03:47:30.000 --> 03:47:32.180]  Starts off with Leanne McAdoo talking about some articles.
[03:47:32.760 --> 03:47:37.682]  One of which is, you know, the Pope said he's gonna, he feels for these people and he weeps for them, or God weeps for them.
[03:47:37.702 --> 03:47:40.002]  He didn't say he whipped for them, which is interesting.
[03:47:40.022 --> 03:47:41.302]  So I guess he doesn't really care.
[03:47:41.322 --> 03:47:42.923]  He just knows that God cares.
[03:47:44.384 --> 03:47:49.729]  And so far he hasn't made one arrest, kicked out one priest, and he admits there's at least 2%.
[03:47:51.210 --> 03:47:52.411]  He says it himself, 2%.
[03:47:52.472 --> 03:47:56.855]  So that would be 8,000 pedophiles in the Catholic Church.
[03:47:57.976 --> 03:48:01.319]  But yet, I'm not going to kick anybody out, and I've been in two and a half years.
[03:48:02.779 --> 03:48:03.820]  What's he doing there?
[03:48:04.260 --> 03:48:05.982]  Next segment, I'm going to have Jakari Jackson sitting in.
[03:48:06.002 --> 03:48:08.224]  We're going to talk about what's coming up on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:48:08.264 --> 03:48:09.685]  And he just showed me an article.
[03:48:10.045 --> 03:48:15.109]  We're going to play some of that footage of the, I guess, the first Russian airstrikes in Syria.
[03:48:15.149 --> 03:48:16.551]  So that should be very interesting.
[03:48:16.571 --> 03:48:18.312]  I've got time for at least a couple more calls.
[03:48:18.352 --> 03:48:20.294]  I got, let's see who's first.
[03:48:20.354 --> 03:48:21.054]  John in Michigan.
[03:48:21.575 --> 03:48:21.875]  Go ahead.
[03:48:21.895 --> 03:48:22.916]  You want to talk about SV40?
[03:48:23.957 --> 03:48:28.701]  Yes, I was told this is in regards to the monkey virus, the SV40.
[03:48:30.592 --> 03:48:40.176]  Well, what I was specifically looking for was SB277, which is the repeal of the mandatory vaccination bill that was signed in California to force children to take vaccines.
[03:48:40.196 --> 03:48:50.721]  But I do know about SV40 and how that was in the polio vaccine and given to hundreds of thousands of people, I think even several million people, in the United States for many years.
[03:48:50.841 --> 03:48:52.742]  And now we have a cancer epidemic.
[03:48:53.302 --> 03:48:53.823]  Who'd have thunk it?
[03:48:54.783 --> 03:48:56.244]  You're correct because it's genetic.
[03:48:56.364 --> 03:48:58.005]  It goes from one generation to the other.
[03:48:58.225 --> 03:48:58.625]  Sure does.
[03:48:59.591 --> 03:49:15.800]  And as far as the vaccine in California, my son's out there and I don't know, his mother-in-law works for Kaiser Permanente, the giant out there, but I'm not sure what they're going to have to deal with.
[03:49:15.860 --> 03:49:17.081]  They're going to probably homeschool.
[03:49:17.958 --> 03:49:18.218]  Yeah.
[03:49:18.939 --> 03:49:20.079]  It's disgusting.
[03:49:20.260 --> 03:49:27.624]  You're going to see an increase in homeschoolings, which is going to, you know, lead to an increase of people not wanting to pay their property taxes to fund these public schools.
[03:49:27.944 --> 03:49:30.106]  Marcus, in California, you got a California guy.
[03:49:30.166 --> 03:49:31.707]  What do you have to say about SB 277?
[03:49:31.747 --> 03:49:34.328]  Hey, how we doing?
[03:49:34.689 --> 03:49:35.229]  I'm doing great.
[03:49:35.249 --> 03:49:35.709]  What's going on?
[03:49:37.030 --> 03:49:40.332]  Well, you know, basically they just crossed the line in the stand.
[03:49:40.652 --> 03:49:44.635]  I heard you mention, you know, you can't believe they got through with all the protests.
[03:49:45.598 --> 03:49:48.320]  Most everyone on the committee didn't even have any children.
[03:49:48.680 --> 03:49:49.321]  Right.
[03:49:49.381 --> 03:49:54.184]  We know Senator Pan has been stunted by Big Pharma through his campaign.
[03:49:54.664 --> 03:49:57.867]  Yeah, and one of Senator Pan's... One quick second.
[03:49:57.887 --> 03:50:04.171]  Telly Blackwood did a video about one of Senator Pan's staffers who actually took a vaccine and became deathly ill.
[03:50:04.191 --> 03:50:10.196]  This guy was in a hospital bed speaking out against 277 and why he's pushing it through and that vaccines do cause harm.
[03:50:10.216 --> 03:50:10.636]  But go ahead.
[03:50:11.701 --> 03:50:14.863]  Yeah, that of course happened and of course you guys covered that.
[03:50:15.423 --> 03:50:16.764]  But that didn't make our news.
[03:50:17.285 --> 03:50:18.785]  I mean, I'm down in San Diego.
[03:50:18.825 --> 03:50:20.346]  That didn't come anywhere on the news.
[03:50:20.466 --> 03:50:21.147]  Of course not.
[03:50:21.227 --> 03:50:22.188]  Yeah, he wasn't there.
[03:50:22.328 --> 03:50:22.608]  Yeah.
[03:50:23.108 --> 03:50:24.509]  Yeah, that doesn't fit the agenda.
[03:50:26.170 --> 03:50:26.950]  Well, exactly.
[03:50:26.970 --> 03:50:33.314]  I mean, we hope that they went too far and they went to the private schools.
[03:50:33.575 --> 03:50:36.756]  Maybe they could have got away with it if they would have stayed public.
[03:50:37.577 --> 03:50:39.118]  We got a lot of wealthy
[03:50:40.390 --> 03:50:45.814]  Very educated people, and they're not going to homeschool, and they're not going to vaccinate.
[03:50:46.394 --> 03:50:47.295]  And that's just it.
[03:50:47.395 --> 03:50:47.595]  Yeah.
[03:50:47.915 --> 03:50:49.276]  You're going to see non-compliance.
[03:50:49.436 --> 03:50:50.537]  Civil disobedience.
[03:50:50.577 --> 03:50:51.597]  That's what needs to happen.
[03:50:51.657 --> 03:50:52.418]  Non-compliance.
[03:50:52.438 --> 03:50:54.159]  That's the only way you're going to make your point.
[03:50:54.519 --> 03:50:59.763]  If you wedge yourself into that cog and say, nope, you're not moving any farther, then the cog will stop.
[03:51:00.363 --> 03:51:01.564]  And then they'll have to take notice.
[03:51:01.904 --> 03:51:05.646]  And when they start taking notice and they realize people are speaking out, then they'll start to change their ways.
[03:51:06.047 --> 03:51:07.307]  The last segment of The Overdrive is coming up.
[03:51:07.327 --> 03:51:09.469]  It's Rob Dute, Alex Jones Show, live.
[03:51:10.029 --> 03:51:17.052]  Hey neighbor, what are you doing digging?
[03:51:17.192 --> 03:51:18.873]  You had a heart attack last year.
[03:51:18.893 --> 03:51:20.134]  Oh, I know.
[03:51:20.394 --> 03:51:21.714]  I was told no more hard labor.
[03:51:22.315 --> 03:51:23.415]  Then why are you digging?
[03:51:23.895 --> 03:51:25.216]  Well, I've been taking ExtendoVite.
[03:51:25.736 --> 03:51:26.977]  It's been approved to help my heart.
[03:51:27.497 --> 03:51:28.357]  ExtendoVite?
[03:51:28.537 --> 03:51:29.418]  Is that a new drug?
[03:51:30.273 --> 03:51:31.033]  No, not a drug.
[03:51:31.634 --> 03:51:34.955]  It's more like an herbal combination made from garlic and cayenne.
[03:51:35.455 --> 03:51:35.935]  Herbal?
[03:51:36.096 --> 03:51:36.976]  How can that help?
[03:51:37.596 --> 03:51:41.698]  Well, actually, we've taken herbs for thousands of years, and Xtendivite is doing the job for me.
[03:51:42.178 --> 03:51:44.259]  Does your doctor know about Xtendivite?
[03:51:44.799 --> 03:51:48.381]  Yeah, my doctor knows, and he said it seems to be working for you, so don't stop taking it.
[03:51:48.681 --> 03:51:50.122]  I feel great taking Xtendivite.
[03:51:50.422 --> 03:51:51.203]  I don't want to stop.
[03:51:51.603 --> 03:51:52.824]  To order, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:52.844 --> 03:51:53.564]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:53.584 --> 03:51:56.066]  Or visit our website at heartdrop.com.
[03:52:09.023 --> 03:52:10.304]  It's now more clear than ever.
[03:52:10.504 --> 03:52:14.106]  The Globalists have launched a planetary destabilization plan.
[03:52:14.206 --> 03:52:17.769]  Here at the Infowars operation, we hope and pray that this is not the case.
[03:52:18.049 --> 03:52:21.832]  But the signs of things deteriorating around the world are unmistakable.
[03:52:21.972 --> 03:52:28.535]  For many years, I've been working with MyPatriotSupply, and we have now developed a private label called InfoWars Select.
[03:52:28.756 --> 03:52:33.518]  Look, it's important to have firearms and water filtration during a collapse, but you've also got to have food.
[03:52:33.738 --> 03:52:41.422]  InfoWars Select is a wide variety of their highest quality packages at the lowest price they have ever offered before.
[03:52:41.542 --> 03:52:41.962]  We're good to go.
[03:53:08.792 --> 03:53:11.755]  Don't complain about your cable bill going up and up and up.
[03:53:11.875 --> 03:53:12.936]  Do something about it.
[03:53:13.096 --> 03:53:15.538]  Grab a pencil and jot down this special number.
[03:53:15.558 --> 03:53:17.700]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:53:17.961 --> 03:53:21.504]  The more cable TV rates go up, the better digital satellite TV looks.
[03:53:21.924 --> 03:53:27.509]  Say goodbye to the cable guy and get more of your favorite channels in 100% digital quality for less money.
[03:53:27.629 --> 03:53:28.110]  Call 1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:53:30.572 --> 03:53:34.315]  Sign up for packages starting as low as $19.99, and there's no equipment to buy.
[03:53:34.375 --> 03:53:39.258]  You get free HDTV upgrade, a free DVR upgrade, and free professional installation.
[03:53:39.438 --> 03:53:41.800]  You control what you watch, when you watch it.
[03:53:42.080 --> 03:53:46.703]  Record your favorite shows, pause and rewind live TV, even skip the commercials.
[03:53:47.043 --> 03:53:48.363]  Watch local channels, too.
[03:53:48.543 --> 03:53:51.024]  At just $19.99, what are you waiting for?
[03:53:51.204 --> 03:53:53.045]  Pull out your major credit or debit card.
[03:53:53.125 --> 03:53:56.406]  Call 1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:53:56.426 --> 03:53:57.946]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:53:58.466 --> 03:54:00.107]  Say goodbye to the cable guy.
[03:54:00.327 --> 03:54:01.867]  Cut costs and get more.
[03:54:01.887 --> 03:54:02.267]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:54:02.287 --> 03:54:02.628]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:54:09.326 --> 03:54:10.147]  Federal agents!
[03:54:10.367 --> 03:54:14.410]  We are armed!
[03:54:21.294 --> 03:54:23.236]  Final segment of the Overdrive Hour.
[03:54:23.276 --> 03:54:27.298]  This is Rob Doo hosting the Alex Jones Show Overdrive Fourth Hour.
[03:54:27.398 --> 03:54:30.000]  If you're not getting this on your local radio station, give them a call.
[03:54:30.020 --> 03:54:32.542]  It's on to pick up the fourth hour because we're doing it live from here on out.
[03:54:33.970 --> 03:54:42.335]  Alex was saying over the break about InfoWars Life Select Foods and how we have a one week left on that introductory offer, which was a two-week introductory offer when we started it.
[03:54:42.855 --> 03:54:43.955]  I have some information for you.
[03:54:44.696 --> 03:54:46.857]  That introductory offer ends tomorrow night at 1159 p.m.
[03:54:46.897 --> 03:54:47.097]  Central.
[03:54:49.876 --> 03:54:52.557]  And so, they got the food prices up there.
[03:54:52.657 --> 03:54:54.078]  I mean, amazing deals there.
[03:54:54.558 --> 03:54:57.259]  Lowest anywhere you can get on InfoWars Select.
[03:54:57.859 --> 03:55:03.081]  You got the two-week supply, four-week, three-month, six-month, one-year for just over $1,400.
[03:55:03.882 --> 03:55:08.204]  So, that ends tomorrow night at 11.59 p.m.
[03:55:08.244 --> 03:55:10.444]  They say midnight, but then that would make it tonight.
[03:55:11.425 --> 03:55:14.126]  We'll say 11.59 tomorrow night.
[03:55:14.666 --> 03:55:16.187]  Also, Liver Shield is back in stock.
[03:55:17.896 --> 03:55:19.957]  Alex, you've heard him about his liver flush stories.
[03:55:20.017 --> 03:55:24.918]  I think we put up a video yesterday called the most disgusting video you need to see.
[03:55:25.718 --> 03:55:28.839]  And they get into graphic detail about what comes out of your liver.
[03:55:29.319 --> 03:55:35.681]  And that's with the help of liver shield along with apple cider vinegar and some distilled water, some oxy powder and all that stuff.
[03:55:35.701 --> 03:55:38.442]  But it's a whole method that you have to do for about six days.
[03:55:38.562 --> 03:55:41.823]  I have not tried it yet, but if I do and when I do, I will let you know.
[03:55:42.583 --> 03:55:44.604]  But a liver shield is now back in stock, so get yours today.
[03:55:44.844 --> 03:55:50.365]  Jakari Jackson's joining me for this last bit to talk about what's coming up on the InfoWars Nightly News tonight, every night, 7 p.m.
[03:55:50.385 --> 03:55:52.466]  Central, except for Saturday and Sunday.
[03:55:52.706 --> 03:55:54.847]  Jakari, what's going to come on, what's going to be on the show tonight?
[03:55:55.147 --> 03:56:05.050]  Well, we have the article that's on InfoWars.com, put up by Kit Daniels, talking about the pro-Second Amendment rally to counter the anti-gun rally that's going to happen at UT campus.
[03:56:05.110 --> 03:56:07.911]  We'll have a special report from Joe Biggs documenting all that.
[03:56:08.251 --> 03:56:10.573]  And first of all, just to say something real quick about that.
[03:56:10.673 --> 03:56:17.019]  Anybody who says that we're trolling this anti-gun group, just recall that back when we did the Alamo speech, they came and trolled us.
[03:56:17.359 --> 03:56:19.661]  They put up pictures of then Master Sergeant C.J.
[03:56:19.701 --> 03:56:20.562]  Grisham, U.S.
[03:56:20.622 --> 03:56:21.763]  Army, who is now retired.
[03:56:22.043 --> 03:56:24.926]  They put up his pictures saying, we have to go out here and counter-protest this guy.
[03:56:24.946 --> 03:56:30.811]  So they've been doing it to us for a good while, so it's not just us following them around and trying to tack on to what they're doing.
[03:56:30.831 --> 03:56:33.153]  And hey, we just want to provide an open discourse of ideas.
[03:56:33.833 --> 03:56:37.115]  Alex tried to talk to him and they got all physical with him in his face at the Alamo.
[03:56:37.135 --> 03:56:44.760]  I mean, it was pretty disturbing the way these liberal trendies who want to be all open and all about freedom, how they want to come down on you if you don't agree with their agenda.
[03:56:44.981 --> 03:56:45.641]  Exactly right.
[03:56:45.981 --> 03:56:49.704]  And speaking about things coming down, we have this special report that's on the site right now.
[03:56:49.764 --> 03:56:53.706]  Caught on tape, dramatic footage of Russia's first airstrikes in Syria.
[03:56:53.726 --> 03:56:54.887]  If we can roll some of that footage.
[03:56:55.187 --> 03:56:58.810]  Now, this is a Zero Hedge article, but we also have an article put up by Kurt Nimmo.
[03:56:59.330 --> 03:57:02.753]  And the Russians told the United States that it should not fly U.S.
[03:57:03.273 --> 03:57:10.118]  warplanes in Syria, but gave no geographical information about where Russia planned to strike.
[03:57:10.158 --> 03:57:11.539]  The senior official said U.S.
[03:57:11.599 --> 03:57:13.481]  missions are continuing as normal.
[03:57:13.941 --> 03:57:17.363]  So you can go there and see all the dramatic footage of the strikes going on.
[03:57:17.444 --> 03:57:20.866]  Can we get Zero Hedge to change official to senior public servant?
[03:57:21.086 --> 03:57:22.527]  Okay, senior public servant.
[03:57:22.547 --> 03:57:25.429]  That's what we need to start referring to him as.
[03:57:25.489 --> 03:57:27.211]  I'm sick and tired of hearing him being called officials.
[03:57:27.691 --> 03:57:31.353]  Yeah, so you can see the footage all right there and we'll talk about this more on the nightly news.
[03:57:31.373 --> 03:57:39.518]  You can see the damage because I think, dude, we so much get into the zone where we just hear about something or, oh, it sucks for them, they're over in another country.
[03:57:40.158 --> 03:57:41.579]  This is happening to real people.
[03:57:41.659 --> 03:57:45.681]  You know, if nothing else, just be concerned that these could be your kids, these could be your neighbors.
[03:57:46.041 --> 03:57:50.804]  Or, you know, what if one of your friends or family was out visiting someplace like this and these airstrikes happen?
[03:57:50.824 --> 03:57:55.747]  You have to take these things seriously and just like, oh, don't brush it off just like it's just another day, another story.
[03:57:56.027 --> 03:57:56.868]  I totally agree.
[03:57:56.908 --> 03:58:00.451]  And this, boy, this is really dramatic footage that you guys are showing up there.
[03:58:00.491 --> 03:58:02.272]  And we've got that up at Infowars.com.
[03:58:02.973 --> 03:58:03.774]  I mean, that's the key.
[03:58:03.854 --> 03:58:07.337]  If we don't put out the information, the mainstream media is not going to put it out.
[03:58:07.397 --> 03:58:09.558]  Because they don't care about this information.
[03:58:09.599 --> 03:58:12.661]  They want to see, treat Russia as the total evil bad guy.
[03:58:12.901 --> 03:58:14.463]  When there's a lot we can learn from the Russians.
[03:58:15.103 --> 03:58:16.704]  Especially in the health realm.
[03:58:17.045 --> 03:58:21.048]  These guys have been looking at health in a lot of different ways in areas that we don't even touch.
[03:58:21.228 --> 03:58:21.408]  Yeah.
[03:58:21.768 --> 03:58:25.291]  And I think we need to start coming together on a lot of these health issues.
[03:58:25.851 --> 03:58:27.112]  And let's look at vaccines.
[03:58:27.132 --> 03:58:29.994]  You know, let's come together and do the real studies on vaccines that we're not getting.
[03:58:30.735 --> 03:58:33.457]  So with that, join Jakari tonight, 7 p.m.
[03:58:33.497 --> 03:58:36.079]  Central, for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:58:36.099 --> 03:58:38.060]  We'll be back here tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:58:38.160 --> 03:58:39.181]  to 3 p.m.
[03:58:39.201 --> 03:58:41.122]  That's right, four hours of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:41.142 --> 03:58:43.504]  We'll see you tomorrow, or tonight, on the Nightly News.
[03:58:43.524 --> 03:58:44.385]  It's Rob Due reporting.
[03:58:51.718 --> 03:58:55.761]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:59.083 --> 03:59:03.186]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[03:59:03.386 --> 03:59:07.589]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[03:59:07.649 --> 03:59:14.994]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[03:59:15.095 --> 03:59:21.459]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because
