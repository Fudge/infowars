[00:00:03.993 --> 00:00:19.524]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership trade package is beginning to unravel, with more prominent voices slamming President Obama and the Republican leadership over the secretive deal that threatens to cost American jobs and hand big corporations new powers that would violate national sovereignty.
[00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:37.647]  House Majority Whip Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Rules Committee Chairman Representative Pete Sessions of Texas refused to reveal to Breitbart whether they had read the TPP agreement but still said they would support the Trade Promotion Authority and allow President Barack Obama to fast-track the TPP.
[00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:45.589]  Lawmakers claim that TPA is separate from TPP and that they will review the final TPP agreement before it is considered by Congress.
[00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.830]  We're good to go!
[00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:07.391]  Not one trade deal that started on fast track has been thwarted.
[00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:16.496]  As such, a vote for TPA is a vote for TPP, since passing TPA will all but guarantee the successful passage of TPP.
[00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:30.564]  Senator Marco Rubio, Senator Lindsey Graham, and Representative John Boehner are also refusing to reveal if they visited the secret room to read the controversial TPP document, although all three are set to vote for the TPA.
[00:01:31.144 --> 00:01:40.253]  Daniel Horowitz, Senior Editor of the Conservative Review writes, Passing a bill in order to find out what's in it is what placed the Pelosi Congress in the ash heap of history.
[00:01:40.393 --> 00:01:42.034]  It's not an auspicious path for ambitious politicians.
[00:01:54.266 --> 00:02:05.531]  The Washington Post reports the push from the President included direct calls to lawmakers, interviews with television stations in key states, and plans to bring several Democrats aboard Air Force One with him.
[00:02:05.852 --> 00:02:15.256]  Meanwhile, despite claims that climate change mandates would not be a part of TPP, President Obama admitted during an NPR interview on Wednesday that this would indeed be the case.
[00:02:15.576 --> 00:02:23.080]  By passing such mandates via the TPP, Obama could sneak through draconian climate regulations under the radar, knowing that they would
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.223]  Almost certainly be rejected by Congress on their own.
[00:02:26.423 --> 00:02:36.193]  This would satisfy calls by the likes of French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, a Bilderberg member, to enforce the new rules via global treaties to cut Congress out of the equation.
[00:02:36.393 --> 00:02:40.517]  Obama will attend summit in Paris in December to negotiate a climate agreement.
[00:02:40.697 --> 00:02:47.684]  Howard Richman writes, Obama would not need to get Congress to approve the unfair climate change treaty terms that he negotiates.
[00:02:48.164 --> 00:02:55.632]  Instead, he could get the commission set up by the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement to add those terms to the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:02:55.892 --> 00:03:06.322]  After that, the Investor State Dispute Settlement Provision set up by that agreement could enforce Obama's terms through the threat of multi-billion dollar fines upon the U.S.
[00:03:06.382 --> 00:03:06.803]  government.
[00:03:07.076 --> 00:03:11.719]  Physicians are rallying as they become increasingly concerned about the passage of TPP.
[00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:21.465]  Prescription drug costs could waylay the affordability of biologics and thousands of prescription drugs by drastically altering intellectual property protections.
[00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:30.231]  Under the TPP, corporations could sue countries for restricting their products due to legislation brought to fruition by their own government policies.
[00:03:30.391 --> 00:03:34.794]  The investor state dispute settlement portion of the TPP gives the upper hand.
[00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:40.037]  Legislative bodies would only act as advisory boards to the ruling corporatic governments.
[00:03:40.778 --> 00:03:48.883]  Most recently, the World Trade Organization Tribunal ruled against the United States in a NAFTA suit brought by Canada and Mexico that claimed the U.S.
[00:03:48.923 --> 00:03:55.968]  country of origin labeling law, which requires foreign meat to be labeled as such, is an unfair and illegal trade practice.
[00:03:56.168 --> 00:04:03.273]  The WTO's May 18th ruling was the fourth time in three years that the global court had ruled against COOL,
[00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:04.470]  Even though U.S.
[00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.015]  courts have ruled that COOL is legal, faced with WTO penalties and threats of retaliation, the U.S.
[00:04:11.055 --> 00:04:21.063]  Congress is now considering repeal of COOL, and American consumers may soon lose the ability to discover if the meat at the grocery store or restaurant is U.S.
[00:04:21.183 --> 00:04:23.525]  raised or from Mexico, Brazil, or China.
[00:04:23.826 --> 00:04:31.812]  Critics of the TPP assert that the trade deal will cost American jobs and give huge corporations the power to change U.S.
[00:04:31.892 --> 00:04:32.213]  laws.

[00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:49.124]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:04:49.204 --> 00:04:51.386]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:04:51.586 --> 00:04:56.789]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:04:56.929 --> 00:05:02.033]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:05:02.153 --> 00:05:05.254]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:05:05.554 --> 00:05:09.475]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:05:09.675 --> 00:05:13.996]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:05:14.076 --> 00:05:24.178]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
