[00:00:01.113 --> 00:00:02.555]  Morgan, Morgan come over here.
[00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:03.395]  Check this out.
[00:00:04.216 --> 00:00:06.198]  Look, I'm gonna feed you some jellos!
[00:00:11.603 --> 00:00:12.564]  I am Chaney!
[00:00:12.864 --> 00:00:13.825]  I am Chaney!
[00:00:14.846 --> 00:00:16.448]  Man, look at all this cool stuff man.
[00:00:16.548 --> 00:00:18.149]  What do you think is cool?
[00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.352]  It's like I like that over there, but that's okay.
[00:00:21.532 --> 00:00:22.633]  I like that thing.
[00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:23.354]  Found it!
[00:00:23.374 --> 00:00:23.935]  We have found it.
[00:00:39.494 --> 00:00:42.516]  Well, I'm for even more war and even more taxes!
[00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.158]  Well, I'm the party for the people!
[00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.000]  No, I'm the party for the people!
[00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:59.545]  What you were just watching was an example of kids running free and playing without any adult supervision.
[00:01:00.225 --> 00:01:05.188]  But what we have today is a now criminalized war on childhood.
[00:01:05.808 --> 00:01:10.990]  Now, to help you understand how vast the war on childhood really is, I have my friend here.
[00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:20.515]  His name is Morgan, and he's going to help me go over and explain some of the recent articles in the world today on how this is being implemented by governments worldwide.
[00:01:21.216 --> 00:01:21.496]  Morgan?
[00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:31.488]  So, the first article we have is by Counter Current News, and it's city forcing a family to destroy a completely awesome cardboard fort.
[00:01:31.848 --> 00:01:41.971]  This family in Utah, their dad made this cardboard fort, and then the city government comes and says, you have to tear this down, it's illegal.
[00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:45.493]  And how fast did they, how fast was the notice?
[00:01:45.653 --> 00:01:49.274]  They had it up, and then the city government came and said,
[00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:52.365]  You have 15 days to take this down or else.
[00:01:52.806 --> 00:01:54.172]  It actually says this right here.
[00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:58.441]  But the city of Ogden has their own name for this curbside chateau.
[00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:01.043]  We had garbage in our yard.
[00:02:02.684 --> 00:02:05.906]  Specifically sighted are a large pile of boxes.
[00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:11.450]  This notice arrived from the city telling the Trentleman's to take the fort down or face a fine.
[00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.316]  If they fail to pay... They can also file criminal charges against us and levy the fines as a lien against the house.
[00:02:19.596 --> 00:02:21.057]  So, they're not playing.
[00:02:21.497 --> 00:02:24.800]  So, I would like to just explain, like, how awesome this looks.
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.506]  I mean, it's a castle, it's got trap doors, slides, it's insanely awesome.
[00:02:30.646 --> 00:02:33.509]  That's not really important to the American viewer, is it?
[00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:35.351]  Now, how dangerous was it?
[00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:37.373]  Did it have machine guns?
[00:02:37.413 --> 00:02:39.315]  Did it have anti-tank missiles?
[00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:41.296]  Did it have a flamethrower?
[00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:43.316]  That is terrifying.
[00:02:43.436 --> 00:02:46.177]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a terror fort!
[00:02:47.197 --> 00:02:52.720]  An Ogden family's outside-of-the-box idea of fun has rallied support from around the world.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.324]  Messages from people in other countries and so forth trying to support us and offering to pay the fines and all that kind of silliness.
[00:02:59.724 --> 00:03:04.066]  The notice from the city of Ogden said the family had 15 days to clean this up.
[00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:09.509]  They have just over a week left and they plan to enjoy that time and let all the neighborhood kids play in it.
[00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:11.270]  Here's what the father had to say.
[00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.373]  He said, I just thought it was an awesome way to use boxes in my kid's imagination.
[00:03:17.054 --> 00:03:17.854]  Wait, hold up.
[00:03:18.314 --> 00:03:19.155]  Don't read anymore.
[00:03:19.395 --> 00:03:21.957]  Wait, did he just say thought and imagination?
[00:03:22.677 --> 00:03:22.937]  Yes.
[00:03:23.618 --> 00:03:25.739]  In America, you're not supposed to think anymore.
[00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.341]  I mean, we have McDonald's to do that for you.
[00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:34.328]  All jokes aside, it's not really funny.
[00:03:34.588 --> 00:03:36.431]  They're banning running in the UK.
[00:03:37.192 --> 00:03:44.180]  This article says, primary school bans children from running in the playground of our health and safety fears.
[00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:49.012]  Now, I know this sounds insane, but it's actually going on.
[00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:54.578]  A primary school has banned children from running in the playground, it was claimed today.
[00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:59.343]  The school says children have been told to stop playing a particular chasing game.
[00:03:59.363 --> 00:04:00.805]  Ooh, I wonder if it was tag.
[00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.591]  Well, they actually have banned tag in New Hampshire.
[00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:05.012]  What?
[00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:05.773]  Yes.
[00:04:05.873 --> 00:04:10.798]  The superintendent said that we cannot have any contact with other kids.
[00:04:10.998 --> 00:04:13.941]  No hugging, no tag, no anything.
[00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:15.282]  No handshakes, nothing.
[00:04:16.143 --> 00:04:17.124]  That's right, Morgan.
[00:04:17.385 --> 00:04:19.327]  But they haven't just banned running.
[00:04:19.347 --> 00:04:21.329]  They've also banned balls.
[00:04:22.523 --> 00:04:29.733]  In New York, ball throwing has become a criminal activity, as this article claims.
[00:04:30.574 --> 00:04:33.457]  New York school bans balls at recess.
[00:04:33.878 --> 00:04:36.902]  Cracks down on tag games over safety fears.
[00:04:37.383 --> 00:04:38.724]  Doesn't this sound like New Hampshire?
[00:04:39.385 --> 00:04:39.546]  Yep!
[00:04:40.382 --> 00:04:46.951]  Tossing a football during recess seemed to be a rite of passage for kids in this school community until now.
[00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:50.416]  I think we need like our soccer balls, the footballs and everything, you know?
[00:04:50.576 --> 00:04:54.922]  Students at Weber Middle School in Port Washington were just informed that during recess,
[00:04:55.402 --> 00:04:56.683]  Football is out.
[00:04:56.944 --> 00:05:06.254]  Hard soccer balls have been banned, along with baseballs and lacrosse balls, even rough games of tag or cartwheels unless supervised by a coach.
[00:05:06.914 --> 00:05:17.125]  A rash of playground injuries has prompted one Long Island, New York school to ban balls and to require teacher supervisions for games like tag.
[00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:27.290]  Some of these injuries can unintentionally become very serious, so we want to make sure our children have fun, but are also protected.
[00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.091]  Isn't that like oil and water?
[00:05:30.132 --> 00:05:31.192]  I skin my knees up.
[00:05:31.272 --> 00:05:32.373]  I get hurt at recess.
[00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:33.694]  It's just part of being a kid.
[00:05:34.394 --> 00:05:34.994]  You get hurt.
[00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.541]  New York and New Hampshire just don't want to face the truth.
[00:05:39.601 --> 00:05:45.386]  And the UK, they ban all those things because they don't want to get sued by parents and stuff.
[00:05:45.406 --> 00:05:47.468]  Isn't it better that we're diabetic and obese?
[00:05:47.968 --> 00:05:50.950]  Well the new old order does want us diabetic and obese.
[00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:55.133]  It's not just running, tag, or ball.
[00:05:56.414 --> 00:06:03.197]  Yes, um, we have an article here.
[00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:06.858]  Six illicit lemonade stands towns had to shut down.
[00:06:07.338 --> 00:06:09.739]  One of which is a little girl named Allie Thorne.
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.221]  Like a lot of kids, six year old Allie Thorne wanted to make some money.
[00:06:13.561 --> 00:06:18.163]  She didn't have dreams of fancy cars, yachts, and a place in the Hamptons.
[00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:21.084]  She just wanted to have enough money to buy stickers.
[00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:23.212]  Just a little bit of stickers.
[00:06:23.452 --> 00:06:24.573]  Just a little bit of money.
[00:06:24.713 --> 00:06:25.574]  Like five dollars.
[00:06:25.614 --> 00:06:26.615]  That's all she wanted.
[00:06:26.975 --> 00:06:28.856]  To buy a few stickers.
[00:06:29.277 --> 00:06:31.799]  And the police came and shut her down.
[00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:34.761]  This is just like I said in my last report.
[00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:36.182]  The War on Entrepreneurs.
[00:06:36.543 --> 00:06:49.233]  The government, anytime they see any child acting out of the norm of watching TV and getting fat on ice cream, they see it as an attack on them and they make plans to shut it down fast.
[00:06:49.853 --> 00:06:54.315]  This is a war on childhood and a war on our basic freedoms that doesn't stop when you turn 18.
[00:06:54.776 --> 00:07:03.780]  We didn't even have time to get to the stack of articles with people letting their grass grow and facing jail time and even having a vegetable garden.
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.881]  But wait a second!
[00:07:05.101 --> 00:07:08.603]  I thought in World War II it was patriotic to grow vegetables.
[00:07:09.283 --> 00:07:10.584]  Now for the real garden.
[00:07:12.725 --> 00:07:15.426]  When the maples are in bloom, it's time to begin planting.
[00:07:17.487 --> 00:07:18.768]  When the moisture is just right,
[00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:21.050]  The soil won't ball or be sticky.
[00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.951]  It holds its shape when pressed, but crumbles easily when broken.
[00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:27.632]  Then it's right for working and planting.
[00:07:29.233 --> 00:07:29.773]  Am I wrong?
[00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:31.113]  No, you're not.
[00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:36.435]  They, in World War II, they did want to have vegetables and growing your own food.
[00:07:36.636 --> 00:07:39.156]  Well, I guess they wanted to be patriotic and strong as a nation.
[00:07:39.517 --> 00:07:39.677]  Yep.
[00:07:40.177 --> 00:07:41.637]  Well, now what do they want us to do?
[00:07:41.697 --> 00:07:44.218]  Are we supposed to grow Twinkies in our backyard?
[00:07:44.498 --> 00:07:45.099]  Yes, we are.
[00:07:46.403 --> 00:07:49.844]  I think we've basically covered the war on childhood and freedom today.
[00:07:50.024 --> 00:07:51.844]  But it doesn't stop here.
[00:07:52.164 --> 00:07:54.165]  Go on InfoWars.com to learn more.
[00:07:54.585 --> 00:07:55.685]  This is my friend Morgan.
[00:07:55.945 --> 00:08:00.766]  We're going to see some more of him in our new report that's coming up, Democrats vs. Republicans.
[00:08:01.827 --> 00:08:04.287]  Stop the war on childhood now!
[00:08:04.948 --> 00:08:06.348]  Go to InfoWars.com.
