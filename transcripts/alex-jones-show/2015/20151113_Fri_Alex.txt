[00:00:01.299 --> 00:00:03.908]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:15.936 --> 00:00:16.576]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.236 --> 00:00:18.257]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:20.098]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.778 --> 00:00:21.578]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:23.259]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:27.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.142]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.154 --> 00:00:37.735]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday the 13th, 2015.
[00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:40.275]  That's November 13th.
[00:00:40.635 --> 00:00:41.696]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:45.356]  We're going to be joined in the show with Anthony Gucciardi.
[00:00:45.396 --> 00:00:51.298]  He's going to be coming on and talking about probably the issue with Monsanto that's coming up.
[00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:54.219]  We've got a college student who is saying, show us the studies.
[00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.520]  That's precisely what we're asking for with climate change.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.541]  Show us the models that accurately predict what you've been saying.
[00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:08.565]  Of course, we do see many scientists who are questioning whether or not it is man-made global warming.
[00:01:09.126 --> 00:01:16.332]  As we reported on the nightly news earlier this week, and we're going to talk about this a little bit more, the sun is actually declining in activity.
[00:01:16.953 --> 00:01:21.657]  That is a far bigger change on our environment than anything that man could do.
[00:01:22.358 --> 00:01:23.259]  You need to understand that.
[00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.841]  And you need to understand what's really behind this push.
[00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:35.471]  You need to understand, we're going to talk about Climate Depot, Mark Moreno, he's been a guest many times on the Alex Jones Show, talking about how this is the last chance, they're telling everybody.
[00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:37.993]  And they've been telling us this for a very long time.
[00:01:38.434 --> 00:01:43.338]  Every time they have a global climate summit, it is the last chance to save the planet.
[00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:46.120]  And of course they're saying that again this year.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:57.963]  But this truly is the last chance for us to stop global governance based on this lie, based on this panic, if we fail to get the people to understand what is going on with this.
[00:01:57.983 --> 00:02:00.044]  So we're going to talk about what's really behind that.
[00:02:00.084 --> 00:02:02.725]  Of course there are three key things that are happening right now.
[00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:11.829]  We see with the open borders that are going on in Europe, we see an active movement to shut down cultures, to shut down and destroy borders.
[00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.050]  And quite frankly, George Soros has been very upfront about it.
[00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:25.896]  We have the Hungarian Prime Minister saying that this is a concerted effort by those on the left, specifically talking about George Soros, who is Hungarian himself.
[00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:30.638]  And the Hungarian Prime Minister says this is an effort to destroy the nations.
[00:02:31.198 --> 00:02:40.303]  He says this plan treats the protection of natural borders as the objective and refugees as an obstacle, says Soros.
[00:02:40.323 --> 00:02:48.568]  Well, you know, that's not really what is going on when he says that he wants to take care of the refugees.
[00:02:48.608 --> 00:02:51.330]  Really, he's using the refugees as a means.
[00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.952]  His objective is global governance, and he wants to get rid of national borders.
[00:02:56.032 --> 00:02:59.875]  And George Soros says national borders are the obstacle.
[00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:10.685]  Understand that national borders and a culture and a contiguous people there that are not divided and fighting amongst themselves, we're going to talk about what that is.
[00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:11.626]  But that's the plan.
[00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:20.134]  If you can get rid of the borders, if you can get the people fighting amongst themselves, then you have removed the obstacles, as George Soros points out, to global governance.
[00:03:20.814 --> 00:03:21.875]  They can then remove
[00:03:22.916 --> 00:03:32.046]  Other obstacles using climate treaties to control the economy or using these trade treaties like the TPP, the TTIP to control the economy.
[00:03:32.406 --> 00:03:45.200]  Both of those treaties have structures that would allow them to create global governance, to allow them to tax, to regulate, to have international courts that would be above the people.
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.561]  So we're going to talk about that, we're going to talk about the back and forth that happened between Donald Trump and Rand Paul in terms of talking about TPP and China.
[00:03:52.581 --> 00:03:57.042]  I think it's very important that we get this right, that we understand what's really going on here.
[00:03:57.623 --> 00:04:03.704]  And of course we're going to have reporters from the Nightly News joining me, Joe Biggs, Leanne McAdoo, Jakari Jackson.
[00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:08.625]  We're going to be talking about their reports, their coverage of these university
[00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.994]  The protests that happened yesterday saying that they want to have free college.
[00:04:13.014 --> 00:04:17.498]  We're also going to talk about the report earlier this week about a media graveyard.
[00:04:17.598 --> 00:04:19.861]  The report that was on the Drudge Report.
[00:04:19.921 --> 00:04:24.786]  Daily newspapers are down nearly 80% and hard news is in danger.
[00:04:24.886 --> 00:04:26.187]  Well, we're going to talk about that.
[00:04:26.528 --> 00:04:28.250]  What is hard news?
[00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.351]  What is real news?
[00:04:29.491 --> 00:04:29.831]  Is there...
[00:04:30.592 --> 00:04:33.894]  Some kind of objective, neutral reporting that happens.
[00:04:33.914 --> 00:04:34.775]  That's what we've been told.
[00:04:34.795 --> 00:04:40.799]  They say that this is going to possibly return back to what we've had 200 years ago, opinion journalism.
[00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:41.879]  Well, you know what?
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.862]  When I look back 200 years ago, that was a time the founders were around.
[00:04:45.862 --> 00:04:46.202]  I don't know.
[00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.131]  Joe Vicks here with InfoWars.com.
[00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:16.033]  Rand Paul calls Obama an idiot on foreign policy.
[00:05:16.053 --> 00:05:21.095]  What kind of idiot sends four people to war in a campaign stop in Iowa yesterday?
[00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:28.899]  Senator Rand Paul had some choice words for the president, labeling him an idiot over his handling of the situation in Syria.
[00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:29.980]  Bravo, Rand Paul.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.460]  Bravo.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.024]  Speaking to the crowd on military and foreign policy, Paul asks, what kind of idiot sends four people to war?
[00:05:37.164 --> 00:05:43.308]  The senator was referring to Obama's monumental fail in attempting to train Syrian rebels to fight ISIS.
[00:05:43.408 --> 00:05:53.454]  The program cost an estimated $500 million, but was aborted as it was revealed that just four or five trainers remained from an initial 54.
[00:05:54.295 --> 00:05:56.979]  If you go to war, you don't go with underwhelming force.
[00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:00.704]  You go to war with overwhelming force, Paul further explained.
[00:06:00.804 --> 00:06:05.551]  Paul also spoke on arming the rebels, calling it crazy foolish to feed arms to people who ate us.

[00:08:21.145 --> 00:08:28.869]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:33.843 --> 00:08:36.205]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, November 13, 2015.
[00:08:37.185 --> 00:08:38.566]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:08:39.066 --> 00:08:44.410]  We're going to be joined later in the show with our reporters, Jakari Jackson, Joe Biggs, Leanne McAdoo.
[00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.973]  We're going to be talking about is hard news really dying?
[00:08:49.033 --> 00:08:50.453]  What is the nature of journalism?
[00:08:50.574 --> 00:08:52.275]  Is opinion journalism a bad thing?
[00:08:52.955 --> 00:08:55.496]  Do we really have objective journalism?
[00:08:55.536 --> 00:09:09.423]  So we're going to talk about that and take a look at the internal dispute that is getting hotter and hotter all the time between Bill O'Reilly and George Will, because I think it touches on, it's interesting theater, actually, folks, when you watch them go back and forth at each other.
[00:09:10.763 --> 00:09:18.407]  Maybe a little bit of Schadenfreude, but anyway, they raise some interesting points about what constitutes real research.
[00:09:18.567 --> 00:09:19.488]  Where do you get your facts?
[00:09:19.528 --> 00:09:20.828]  How do you vet the information?
[00:09:20.968 --> 00:09:22.029]  How should this be presented?
[00:09:22.589 --> 00:09:25.970]  They're also going to be talking about students marching across the U.S.
[00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.852]  demanding that they get a free government college education.
[00:09:29.872 --> 00:09:31.933]  I think that's pretty amazing.
[00:09:31.953 --> 00:09:37.955]  You know, quite frankly, when I went to college, the tuition was less than the books.
[00:09:38.075 --> 00:09:39.516]  I went to the University of South Florida.
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:46.784]  And you could afford to work a part-time job because you could get jobs then as a kid.
[00:09:46.824 --> 00:09:55.550]  We didn't have the borders open and have adults coming across the border from third world countries to work at minimum wage, keeping students from getting jobs.
[00:09:56.171 --> 00:10:02.895]  And you could afford the tuition, but what's happened is over the decades, tuition has gradually risen because of government subsidy.
[00:10:03.956 --> 00:10:06.778]  Whenever you subsidize something, you make it less efficient.
[00:10:07.058 --> 00:10:07.719]  You know what we ought to do?
[00:10:08.578 --> 00:10:23.765]  We ought to have a requirement for anybody going into college, they ought to first be able, just as they have to have certain minimum entrance exams, I think they ought to have to show that they understand economics and how it applies to their personal life in terms of getting a degree.
[00:10:23.785 --> 00:10:25.446]  Well, but that would, that would work against
[00:10:25.686 --> 00:10:27.026]  What the colleges want, isn't it?
[00:10:27.267 --> 00:10:29.027]  And I'm not talking about macroeconomics.
[00:10:29.047 --> 00:10:30.708]  That's a bunch of nonsense, okay?
[00:10:30.728 --> 00:10:34.129]  The fact that that's what they use to push Keynesian economics.
[00:10:34.149 --> 00:10:35.629]  That's all macroeconomics.
[00:10:35.649 --> 00:10:37.750]  The money that we owe to ourselves really doesn't matter.
[00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:38.390]  Baloney.
[00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:39.110]  Baloney.
[00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.851]  Because that money isn't money that we owe to ourselves anymore.
[00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.752]  It's money that we owe to China.
[00:10:44.432 --> 00:10:46.593]  Because they bought our debt from the Federal Reserve.
[00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:51.799]  So yeah, it'd be interesting to know if the kids really understand what they're going for.
[00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:57.386]  I mean, there's a quote here in this article, I want to graduate without debt.
[00:10:57.426 --> 00:11:02.172]  Community College has been kind to me, but if I want to go on, I have to take on debt.
[00:11:02.272 --> 00:11:03.413]  Well, you know, maybe
[00:11:04.014 --> 00:11:07.897]  That college, that community college degree isn't going to really be worth anything to you.
[00:11:08.138 --> 00:11:09.779]  You have to live in the real world.
[00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:14.703]  You have to look at what this is really the value of this degree that you're getting.
[00:11:14.723 --> 00:11:16.805]  There's some degrees that are very valuable economically.
[00:11:17.125 --> 00:11:26.873]  And then there's others that are totally worthless and you're accumulating this massive debt and there's absolutely no reason to think that you're going to get anything from it economically.
[00:11:27.134 --> 00:11:30.596]  But what they want to do is they want to make their debt your debt.
[00:11:31.431 --> 00:11:32.312]  And it's not just that.
[00:11:32.993 --> 00:11:35.756]  They want this opened up for everyone.
[00:11:35.796 --> 00:11:44.546]  They say, we want people of all color, all genders, all sexual orientations, and we're united to fight for education as a human right.
[00:11:44.566 --> 00:11:45.727]  Well, you know what they need to add to that?
[00:11:46.787 --> 00:11:53.412]  All nationalities, people from every country in the world are going to come here and demand that they get a free ride.
[00:11:53.432 --> 00:11:54.493]  You don't think that's going to happen?
[00:11:54.873 --> 00:12:00.577]  Look at the fact that we have illegal aliens coming into this country and getting in-state tuition rates right now.
[00:12:01.037 --> 00:12:01.417]  Right now.
[00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:10.624]  That our American students, whose parents have lived here and paid taxes all their life, cannot get a preferential tax rate if they want to go from one state to another.
[00:12:10.984 --> 00:12:14.226]  They have to pay the higher rate because they didn't pay taxes in that other state.
[00:12:14.286 --> 00:12:14.727]  You understand?
[00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:20.436]  You get a lower rate if you're a resident because you've been paying taxes to support that state university system.
[00:12:20.456 --> 00:12:24.821]  But if you go to another state, they don't give you that lower rate because you haven't been paying that.
[00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:29.907]  But if you're an illegal alien, you can go to any state in the union and get in-state tuition.
[00:12:30.228 --> 00:12:33.151]  And so what this is, there's a couple of things involved with this.
[00:12:34.292 --> 00:12:36.914]  One of them is the Cloward and Piven takedown of this country.
[00:12:37.194 --> 00:12:38.556]  Expanding the entitlement state.
[00:12:39.056 --> 00:12:40.697]  Accelerating the takedown of the country.
[00:12:41.418 --> 00:12:45.061]  The other thing is, the government wants you to stay in college.
[00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:47.122]  They want you to stay in their system.
[00:12:47.162 --> 00:12:54.248]  They want you from kindergarten, from time you're a three-year-old when you can barely talk, until you're in your mid-thirties, preferably.
[00:12:54.448 --> 00:12:54.768]  Okay?
[00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:57.891]  They want you to stay in there as long as possible.
[00:12:57.971 --> 00:12:58.391]  And then,
[00:12:59.312 --> 00:13:05.236]  As a condition to pay for your education, they want you to take some kind of government service job or work for the government.
[00:13:05.276 --> 00:13:07.497]  They don't want you to ever get out of that government bubble.
[00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:14.202]  They not only want to completely train you from cradle to grave, and, you know, look, understand.
[00:13:14.782 --> 00:13:15.842]  Everybody has understood this.
[00:13:15.862 --> 00:13:25.126]  You don't even need to keep people in school until they're in their mid-twenties or early thirties in order to completely brainwash them into a way of thinking.
[00:13:25.686 --> 00:13:27.466]  You can do that in much less time.
[00:13:27.687 --> 00:13:30.227]  That was what Plato was talking about in his Republic.
[00:13:30.247 --> 00:13:31.408]  He wanted to get rid of the families.
[00:13:32.088 --> 00:13:35.690]  And he wanted to keep people under the rule of the thumb.
[00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:44.154]  He wanted them to see the state as their family, not even to know who their mother and father were, to get them at an early age and raise them by the state.
[00:13:44.214 --> 00:13:45.755]  That's how you control the population.
[00:13:45.775 --> 00:13:47.956]  That's how you take over the next generation.
[00:13:48.016 --> 00:13:52.239]  And that has been the dream of socialists from the very beginning.
[00:13:52.819 --> 00:13:53.619]  Just look at this.
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.720]  School to homeschoolers.
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.741]  Sign up or face criminal charges.
[00:13:57.761 --> 00:13:58.601]  This is WND.
[00:13:58.641 --> 00:14:00.481]  They're talking about homeschool parents in Florida.
[00:14:00.501 --> 00:14:04.043]  This is a story that was put out by the Homeschool Legal Defense Association.
[00:14:04.103 --> 00:14:12.525]  If you are a homeschooler, you need to be involved with HSLDA because they are the ones who are going to be there for you, who have your back.
[00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:20.408]  When some activist, local politician decides that they're going to create a new rule, which is what happened in this Florida county,
[00:14:20.987 --> 00:14:28.450]  They're going to unilaterally create this new rule that they have absolutely no authority for, and you don't have any responsibility to obey them.
[00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:36.414]  But understand that if you don't, you're going to have men with guns at your door to take your kids and to kill you if you don't turn them over.
[00:14:36.434 --> 00:14:39.455]  And that really has happened to homeschoolers in the early days.
[00:14:39.535 --> 00:14:44.597]  It happened quite frequently before we started organizing with a legal defense association.
[00:14:44.637 --> 00:14:45.538]  Listen to the details of this.
[00:14:45.558 --> 00:14:48.539]  This little county, Santa Rosa County in Florida,
[00:14:49.768 --> 00:14:56.612]  They sent out letters demanding that parents give them information that the parents are not required to provide under Florida state law.
[00:14:57.132 --> 00:14:59.873]  The information included things like social security number, race, grade level.
[00:15:00.193 --> 00:15:12.860]  The parents also received a letter demanding they comply with new district policy requiring them to show proof of residency and to prove that they no longer were registered in whatever district they most recently had been registered under.
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:22.944]  Now, HSLDA sent their staff attorney and they said, look, Florida law does not require proof of residency or any of this new information that you are demanding.
[00:15:23.484 --> 00:15:32.207]  They say the parents were bluntly told the district will be terminating your request to file your intent to homeschool in Santa Rosa County School District.
[00:15:32.267 --> 00:15:32.627]  You know what?
[00:15:33.187 --> 00:15:34.128]  I homeschooled my kid.
[00:15:34.668 --> 00:15:43.338]  This kid, both of, all of my kids, both my sons who are now out of school, my daughter who's still in school, I don't request information to educate my children.
[00:15:44.554 --> 00:15:45.274]  I don't request.
[00:15:45.735 --> 00:15:48.856]  I don't respond to demands from the government about my children.
[00:15:48.936 --> 00:15:49.696]  They're my children.
[00:15:50.317 --> 00:15:52.237]  And I don't request anything from the government.
[00:15:52.277 --> 00:15:53.638]  They don't belong to the government.
[00:15:54.138 --> 00:15:54.859]  They belong to me.
[00:15:54.879 --> 00:16:00.381]  I haven't gotten over that quaint notion, you know, that Melissa Harris Perry says we should get over.
[00:16:00.721 --> 00:16:04.103]  Anyway, they say you've got three days to register your children in a public or private school.
[00:16:04.183 --> 00:16:09.545]  If you don't, you will be in violation of compulsory attendance laws, so forth and so on.
[00:16:09.565 --> 00:16:10.906]  So they sent a letter out to the attorney.
[00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:26.509]  He refused to acknowledge, to accept that the Florida Department of Education denies local school districts authority to add to the home education law or to listen to the fact that the HSLDA has opposed all other district attempts at similar requirements.
[00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.092]  Now, this is one county.
[00:16:29.912 --> 00:16:33.595]  This is one state, but you may run into that wherever you are.
[00:16:33.755 --> 00:16:39.300]  Anywhere where there's a petty-fogging bureaucrat who thinks that he should run your life, you can run into that sort of thing.
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.162]  That's why we need to stand together.
[00:16:41.742 --> 00:16:43.844]  We need to unite issue by issue.
[00:16:44.205 --> 00:16:46.126]  We need to get active at the local level.
[00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:51.071]  And that's why this, you know, the presidential race is interesting.
[00:16:52.188 --> 00:17:02.454]  Because there's some interesting and there's some big topics, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, like the treaty to establish global governance based on climate change.
[00:17:03.034 --> 00:17:12.840]  These are big overriding issues, and when we watch the candidates debate these issues, understand that they are surrogates for the people who are the real government.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.181]  So it's interesting, however, to watch how these surrogates make the arguments.
[00:17:17.262 --> 00:17:23.924]  It's also interesting when things get a little bit tough, like they did with Marco Rubio, to watch how they fall back to their prepared statements.
[00:17:24.405 --> 00:17:30.447]  You can really get a glimpse of what's going on with these people, and really understand what's going on.
[00:17:31.247 --> 00:17:34.789]  You need to think globally, because they're thinking and planning globally.
[00:17:34.809 --> 00:17:41.392]  You need to understand where they're headed with all this, and that's what's valuable about watching the presidential debates, about watching these people talk.
[00:17:42.435 --> 00:17:48.619]  But you also need to understand that it is at the local level when they come for your kids with the sheriff.
[00:17:49.599 --> 00:17:55.083]  And when we're talking about that, let me go to this story now about this rancher that was shot.
[00:17:56.158 --> 00:18:00.901]  We first reported what the official story was, which was that there was some kind of a shootout.
[00:18:00.941 --> 00:18:02.221]  They didn't know why this happened.
[00:18:02.282 --> 00:18:12.327]  This is a case in Idaho where a bull was, this is open range territory, so the animals are roaming around, or he got out of a fenced-in area.
[00:18:12.367 --> 00:18:13.748]  Nevertheless, he was hit by a car.
[00:18:14.829 --> 00:18:16.129]  He gets a call at the dinner table.
[00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.491]  They say, come down, you've got to take care of this bull.
[00:18:19.981 --> 00:18:32.770]  And we were told that this resulted in some kind of a shootout between two deputies and the rancher who came down with the bull and then subsequently the wife had a heart attack and nearly died.
[00:18:33.931 --> 00:18:42.076]  There's been a little bit of time now and some local reporters at the Idaho paper, let's see which paper is this, it's the Idaho
[00:18:43.334 --> 00:18:50.543]  Idaho statesman went down and interviewed people there and they've had a meeting with the sheriff, the community there.
[00:18:51.024 --> 00:18:57.031]  Over 200 people in this small community grill the sheriff on why deputies gunned down the Idaho rancher.
[00:18:57.051 --> 00:19:00.576]  This is a story that Don Salazar had two days ago.
[00:19:01.846 --> 00:19:04.610]  And I really want to look at this in detail.
[00:19:05.432 --> 00:19:09.518]  We don't really have time for it right now, but I'm going to talk about this in detail when we come back.
[00:19:09.578 --> 00:19:13.585]  Let's play that clip, guys, the video clip that we've got of this.
[00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:21.834]  Jack's just a well-known rancher who's been here for 62 years, born and raised here.
[00:19:22.134 --> 00:19:35.181]  The community of Council, Idaho is coping with the loss of a well-known rancher, Jack Yantis, shot and killed by deputies Sunday night, shortly after being notified about a bull from his ranch being hit by a car on Highway 95.
[00:19:36.122 --> 00:19:41.985]  Police say the bull was giving emergency crews problems as they try to rescue the victims of the car accident.
[00:19:42.285 --> 00:19:48.688]  The bull became aggressive, was charging vehicles, first responders.
[00:19:48.888 --> 00:19:52.911]  Okay, let's hold it right there because we have to go to a commercial break and we're going to play some more of that for you.
[00:19:52.931 --> 00:19:59.734]  But we're only going to break down what happened based on what eyewitnesses are saying and the way the government is reacting.
[00:19:59.774 --> 00:20:03.376]  And let me ask you this, where are Black Lives Matter with this?
[00:20:03.456 --> 00:20:09.719]  And what does this tell us about the whole Black Lives Matter movement and about what's going on with our police?
[00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:10.920]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:20:12.523 --> 00:20:16.744]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[00:20:17.164 --> 00:20:20.904]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[00:20:21.445 --> 00:20:22.685]  We typically do the same thing.
[00:20:22.825 --> 00:20:25.365]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[00:20:25.845 --> 00:20:27.466]  But have you considered heat storage?
[00:20:28.066 --> 00:20:29.846]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[00:20:30.266 --> 00:20:31.946]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[00:20:32.546 --> 00:20:33.927]  How will I keep my family warm?
[00:20:34.187 --> 00:20:36.627]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[00:20:36.667 --> 00:20:40.728]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[00:20:41.576 --> 00:20:42.277]  Another concern?
[00:20:42.677 --> 00:20:46.359]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.921]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[00:20:49.261 --> 00:20:52.444]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[00:20:53.224 --> 00:20:55.686]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[00:20:56.046 --> 00:21:00.009]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[00:21:00.689 --> 00:21:02.030]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[00:21:02.691 --> 00:21:03.992]  FortressClothing.com.
[00:21:04.332 --> 00:21:05.693]  You'll never be cold again.
[00:21:09.562 --> 00:21:12.565]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[00:21:12.865 --> 00:21:18.031]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[00:21:18.371 --> 00:21:20.253]  But they're about to lose control.
[00:21:20.633 --> 00:21:25.638]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:30.423]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:21:30.543 --> 00:21:32.585]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:21:32.945 --> 00:21:36.428]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[00:21:36.788 --> 00:21:40.071]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[00:21:40.191 --> 00:21:40.852]  And they did.
[00:21:41.292 --> 00:21:44.214]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:21:44.415 --> 00:21:46.837]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:21:47.017 --> 00:21:48.418]  This will affect us all.
[00:21:48.878 --> 00:21:52.361]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[00:21:53.582 --> 00:21:59.825]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.

[00:22:11.988 --> 00:22:12.708]  Another shooting.
[00:22:13.108 --> 00:22:14.348]  And they're getting worse.
[00:22:14.829 --> 00:22:18.050]  That's why Infidel Body Armor introduces Infidel Fridays.

[00:23:08.749 --> 00:23:12.252]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:23:12.993 --> 00:23:13.493]  It's true.
[00:23:13.594 --> 00:23:17.557]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:23:17.757 --> 00:23:19.599]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:24.644]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[00:23:24.944 --> 00:23:32.311]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA.
[00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:37.532]  Pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[00:23:37.792 --> 00:23:41.333]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[00:23:41.593 --> 00:23:43.873]  The gold standard in water purification.

[00:24:17.358 --> 00:24:18.579]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:18.639 --> 00:24:19.760]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:32.368]  We're going to go back and talk about this Idaho shooting that revolved around this bull that got hit by a car, the rancher who was killed in that, and the meeting that happened this week.
[00:24:32.408 --> 00:24:37.232]  Because this has a lot to do with the changes that we've seen in the police.
[00:24:37.932 --> 00:24:40.374]  And Black Lives Matter is not involved in this.
[00:24:40.414 --> 00:24:41.495]  This is a rural area.
[00:24:41.515 --> 00:24:44.296]  I think everybody is white in this rural area of Idaho.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:52.040]  If this happened, and you can, when we go over the details of this, you will see a lot of similarities to what's going on in the inner cities.
[00:24:53.134 --> 00:25:05.879]  The difference is that you have a black population there, and I understand that the black population has been the victim of these new rules of engagement that they have created for the police far more than other people have.
[00:25:06.519 --> 00:25:12.941]  But we need to stand together instead of subdividing people and saying that this is simply a racism issue.
[00:25:13.061 --> 00:25:15.022]  It is not simply a racism issue.
[00:25:15.042 --> 00:25:17.783]  It would be a lot easier to fix if that were the case.
[00:25:18.323 --> 00:25:23.467]  This is something we have to understand what the problem is before we can possibly fix it.
[00:25:23.527 --> 00:25:42.541]  So we're going to talk about that and I think I want to talk too about the kind of subliminal slip that came out of Chris Christie on Veterans Day, essentially alluding to the fact that he believes that law enforcement in this country are also veterans and that they are under the command of the President.
[00:25:43.584 --> 00:25:45.085]  That didn't get much exposure.
[00:25:45.105 --> 00:25:46.266]  We're going to talk about that as well.
[00:25:46.306 --> 00:25:47.726]  So, I've got a lot to talk about with that.
[00:25:47.967 --> 00:25:49.768]  I want to do that in the next segment.
[00:25:50.068 --> 00:25:54.650]  I'll cover some news, some breaking news that's on other issues in this shorter segment.
[00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:58.232]  Before I do, I just want to let you know about a new product and a new special that we have.
[00:25:58.552 --> 00:25:59.293]  We have a new product.
[00:25:59.753 --> 00:26:02.474]  Living Defense at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:26:03.175 --> 00:26:08.297]  It's clear that statistics say that nine out of ten people are infested with harmful organisms.
[00:26:08.337 --> 00:26:13.919]  These toxic organisms can be transmitted by other people, by pets, by food, the environment to you.
[00:26:14.379 --> 00:26:19.402]  Once these organisms have made it inside your body, they steal your nutrients and release toxic waste.
[00:26:19.502 --> 00:26:24.904]  A way to get rid of this is with the natural organic herbs that we have in Living Defense.
[00:26:24.944 --> 00:26:25.564]  You can get that.
[00:26:25.644 --> 00:26:27.785]  That's our new product at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:26:27.805 --> 00:26:28.786]  We also have a new special.
[00:26:29.446 --> 00:26:32.168]  Winter sun, vitamin D3, 20% off.
[00:26:32.648 --> 00:26:33.608]  Winter is coming up.
[00:26:33.729 --> 00:26:39.212]  Now is a good time to get this essential nutrient in a very bioavailable form.
[00:26:39.272 --> 00:26:41.513]  Winter sun, vitamin D3, it's a liquid form.
[00:26:41.813 --> 00:26:45.595]  You can find that also at InfoWarsLife.com and on special at 20% off.
[00:26:47.244 --> 00:26:50.806]  Let's take a quick look at what we have left of this shorter segment.
[00:26:51.486 --> 00:26:53.147]  Some news is coming out, some economic news.
[00:26:53.167 --> 00:26:59.890]  The government has added a record $339 billion to the debt the very first day after they raised the debt ceiling.
[00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:00.891]  How about that?
[00:27:00.911 --> 00:27:04.092]  You know how that was going to last us for two years?
[00:27:04.112 --> 00:27:04.712]  That was going to go on to 2017.
[00:27:04.832 --> 00:27:07.294]  And one day they added $339 billion to the total debt.
[00:27:07.314 --> 00:27:07.714]  So that's
[00:27:14.657 --> 00:27:16.698]  We're seeing this growing at an accelerating rate.
[00:27:16.738 --> 00:27:20.201]  They point out the government ran a deficit of $136 billion last month.
[00:27:20.681 --> 00:27:23.623]  That's up 12% compared to the previous October.
[00:27:24.083 --> 00:27:24.944]  Spending ballooned.
[00:27:25.184 --> 00:27:27.125]  Taxes remained essentially flat.
[00:27:27.205 --> 00:27:35.891]  The worst October since 2010 when the government was still spending on the stimulus and was at pace for a deficit of more than a trillion dollars that year.
[00:27:35.951 --> 00:27:37.672]  That's the Washington Times pointing that out.
[00:27:37.953 --> 00:27:43.296]  I would say that maybe the stimulus would be part of the bailout to the bankers.
[00:27:43.616 --> 00:27:44.337]  And of course we've got
[00:27:44.877 --> 00:27:49.942]  Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, saying that cash is going to die.
[00:27:50.503 --> 00:27:52.444]  He made a very bold prediction in the UK.
[00:27:53.005 --> 00:27:58.830]  He told the students at Trinity College in Dublin, he said, your kids will not know what money is.
[00:27:59.691 --> 00:28:06.958]  Well, you know, when I look at this economic news about adding $339 billion of debt in one day, I say, well, maybe we don't know what money is either.
[00:28:07.887 --> 00:28:12.110]  Okay, but he's saying they're not going to have any experience with cash.
[00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:17.193]  He thinks that he's going to take over and get a cut, just like the Federal Reserve gets a cut.
[00:28:17.433 --> 00:28:18.414]  Isn't that going to be great?
[00:28:18.434 --> 00:28:22.177]  You know, we've got these designing people all over Silicon Valley.
[00:28:22.457 --> 00:28:28.341]  Apple wants to take over the money and all purchases, and we've got Google that wants to take over your car.
[00:28:28.381 --> 00:28:30.122]  They want to drive your car for you.
[00:28:30.862 --> 00:28:34.545]  This is an interesting article that was up on the Drudge Report.
[00:28:34.645 --> 00:28:37.627]  Google self-driving car pulled over for driving too slowly.
[00:28:38.448 --> 00:28:43.853]  Now there's a cop, after my own heart, pulling a car over for going too slowly and holding out traffic.
[00:28:44.334 --> 00:28:46.136]  One of Google's self-driving vehicles was pulled over.
[00:28:46.176 --> 00:28:47.237]  Who gets the ticket, they ask?
[00:28:47.257 --> 00:28:48.338]  The passenger or the car?
[00:28:48.378 --> 00:28:52.322]  The vehicle was traveling 24 miles an hour in a 35 mile an hour zone.
[00:28:52.362 --> 00:28:57.547]  And I've read articles about how fed up people are following these stupid clown cars around.
[00:28:58.408 --> 00:29:21.634]  Sitting at a stop sign, a four-way stop sign, one guy, and this is a reporter that was riding in the Google car, and he said, yeah, we were there for five minutes waiting for the Google car to feel safe about crossing in this four-way stop, and finally an old guy with white hair pulled around us, honked his horn, swore at us, shot us a bird, and went on.
[00:29:21.694 --> 00:29:22.874]  It's like, you think?
[00:29:23.134 --> 00:29:23.554]  You think?
[00:29:23.934 --> 00:29:25.334]  And I wasn't out there, okay?
[00:29:25.714 --> 00:29:26.875]  That wasn't me.
[00:29:28.115 --> 00:29:30.277]  Understand these things, and I forget what the exact total is.
[00:29:30.297 --> 00:29:37.223]  This is something like three or four times the number of accidents that humans have, have been Google cars.
[00:29:37.263 --> 00:29:39.865]  But of course, they tell us, oh, it's not our fault.
[00:29:40.706 --> 00:29:44.550]  Look, when you drive the way these cars drive, you create accidents.
[00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:47.372]  You have to understand that it isn't speed that creates accidents.
[00:29:47.652 --> 00:29:48.693]  It's differences in speed.
[00:29:48.733 --> 00:29:51.616]  It's the careless, stupid way these things are driving.
[00:29:51.636 --> 00:29:52.036]  Stay with us.
[00:29:52.196 --> 00:29:52.797]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:59.252 --> 00:30:02.239]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.162 --> 00:30:05.868]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.312 --> 00:30:15.995]  New report expects a million cancer deaths from Fukushima fallout.
[00:30:16.575 --> 00:30:19.157]  Underestimated and under-reported.
[00:30:19.597 --> 00:30:22.999]  Article up at InfoWars.com by Christian Seric.
[00:30:23.719 --> 00:30:32.604]  In a new report published by Fair Wind Energy Education, or FEE, cancer is on the rise in post-Fukushima Japan.
[00:30:32.844 --> 00:30:37.747]  We learned that the ongoing multi-core nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima
[00:30:37.927 --> 00:30:53.477]  This plant has produced approximately 230 times higher than normal thyroid cancers in Fukushima Prefecture and could result in as many as 1 million more cancers due to the incident that happened in March of 2011.
[00:30:54.998 --> 00:31:02.744]  Five years later and we are still getting a grip on how catastrophic Fukushima truly was to this planet and its people.
[00:31:03.304 --> 00:31:06.626]  You can read more about this at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:06.646 --> 00:31:07.527]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:31:09.628 --> 00:31:12.829]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:13.129 --> 00:31:21.133]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:21.373 --> 00:31:26.415]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:31:26.795 --> 00:31:29.057]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:31:29.297 --> 00:31:31.118]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[00:31:31.439 --> 00:31:37.323]  Secure your DNA Force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:31:37.523 --> 00:31:40.406]  Brain Force is here.
[00:31:40.606 --> 00:31:42.707]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:31:42.807 --> 00:31:47.571]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:31:47.811 --> 00:31:51.034]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:31:51.094 --> 00:31:54.316]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:31:54.576 --> 00:31:56.278]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:31:56.578 --> 00:31:57.459]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:31:57.479 --> 00:31:58.419]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:31:58.679 --> 00:32:00.461]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:32:26.838 --> 00:32:35.670]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:41.898]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutramedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:32:42.158 --> 00:32:44.822]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:32:45.542 --> 00:32:46.343]  We're good to go.
[00:33:20.069 --> 00:33:22.189]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:25.770]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.491]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:29.591 --> 00:33:31.151]  I'm David Knight, your host this hour.
[00:33:31.171 --> 00:33:33.252]  We're going to be joined later in the show.
[00:33:33.292 --> 00:33:37.312]  It's actually in the next hour we're going to be joined by the rest of the Nightly News crew, pretty much.
[00:33:37.332 --> 00:33:41.313]  So the reporters, Joe Biggs, Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo will be coming in.
[00:33:41.353 --> 00:33:44.694]  We'll be talking about what is real media?
[00:33:45.214 --> 00:33:45.814]  Is real media
[00:33:46.792 --> 00:33:47.353]  Disappearing?
[00:33:47.373 --> 00:33:50.419]  This is a report that was on the Drudge Report earlier this week.
[00:33:50.439 --> 00:33:52.263]  Daily newspapers down nearly 80 percent.
[00:33:52.483 --> 00:33:53.926]  Hard news is in danger!
[00:33:53.946 --> 00:33:55.128]  Is it really?
[00:33:55.854 --> 00:34:04.480]  Are we going to be suffering from confusing opinion journalism like we had 200 years ago when the country was founded?
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.422]  Is that a good thing or is that a bad thing?
[00:34:06.442 --> 00:34:07.362]  We're going to talk about that.
[00:34:07.382 --> 00:34:15.088]  We're also going to talk about the back and forth between Bill O'Reilly and George Will on Bill O'Reilly's book, Killing Reagan.
[00:34:15.188 --> 00:34:18.490]  I think it's a very entertaining exchange back and forth between these two guys.
[00:34:19.051 --> 00:34:20.051]  It got very heated.
[00:34:20.652 --> 00:34:23.294]  They've continued to attack each other in the press.
[00:34:23.874 --> 00:34:31.238]  But it brings up some interesting concepts underlying all of this, and that is, what do you do to vet your sources?
[00:34:31.318 --> 00:34:34.880]  How do you determine if your information is accurate or not?
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:35.681]  Who do you talk to?
[00:34:36.261 --> 00:34:40.243]  So it has some real important issues underneath it, but it is also very entertaining.
[00:34:40.263 --> 00:34:50.930]  We're also going to be talking about the reports, and they went to several of the marches, students who are saying that they want a free public college.
[00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:52.591]  So we're going to talk about that.
[00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:59.117]  And we're also going to have Anthony Gucciardi joining us in the third hour talking about news.
[00:34:59.477 --> 00:35:05.863]  I mentioned earlier this story in Idaho where the deputies shot a rancher.
[00:35:05.903 --> 00:35:09.526]  I want to go down the details that have now come out because the story has changed.
[00:35:09.827 --> 00:35:13.410]  And I think this is something that is very important for us to look at because there have been
[00:35:14.531 --> 00:35:21.018]  Giant, radical changes in the way the police interact with the communities throughout this country.
[00:35:21.659 --> 00:35:24.862]  Not just in the cities, not just against black people.
[00:35:25.322 --> 00:35:26.343]  This is universal.
[00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:28.025]  It's being driven from Washington.
[00:35:28.085 --> 00:35:31.689]  We have hammered this point here at InfoWars relentlessly.
[00:35:32.029 --> 00:35:34.392]  This is a national agenda.
[00:35:34.452 --> 00:35:36.694]  It is part of nationalizing the police.
[00:35:37.535 --> 00:35:44.178]  And this is a shoot-first curriculum, as one of the New Mexico instructors at the State Police Academy said.
[00:35:44.198 --> 00:35:48.700]  He said, I'm not going to shoot, I'm not going to teach this new curriculum because it's a shoot-first curriculum.
[00:35:49.041 --> 00:35:50.041]  I refuse to teach this.
[00:35:50.741 --> 00:35:55.484]  It's a very different way that the police are interacting with people than they used to in the past.
[00:35:55.524 --> 00:35:57.585]  And it's being driven by Washington.
[00:35:57.965 --> 00:36:01.166]  Like, one evidence of this was after the debate on
[00:36:02.267 --> 00:36:03.308]  It was actually on Wednesday.
[00:36:04.088 --> 00:36:06.770]  Chris Christie was talking about Veterans Day.
[00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:14.514]  And he was talking about how Hillary Clinton had disrespected veterans by saying she didn't really think the VA situation was that much of a problem.
[00:36:14.554 --> 00:36:16.795]  He says, you're disrespecting the veterans.
[00:36:17.075 --> 00:36:27.201]  And when Obama disrespects law officers, he has no authority to command them, those law enforcement officers in uniform.
[00:36:28.022 --> 00:36:29.943]  He put those two things together in his mind.
[00:36:30.771 --> 00:36:37.796]  Understand that Chris Christie does think that he's at war with the American people, a drug war, among other things.
[00:36:38.637 --> 00:36:51.427]  But I thought it was very telling that in his mind, he sees the president as the commander-in-chief of the law enforcement officers in uniform in this country, that he sees them as veterans in a war.
[00:36:51.447 --> 00:36:52.828]  A war against who?
[00:36:52.928 --> 00:36:53.789]  Well, that would be us.
[00:36:55.182 --> 00:37:01.106]  Those of us that they feel that they can command in any way they feel that they don't have to respond with information.
[00:37:01.146 --> 00:37:07.670]  That's precisely what happened in the meeting with these residents in Council, Idaho.
[00:37:08.231 --> 00:37:14.095]  Now, let me give you some of the facts as we're now starting to see them and the two different sides of the story that have emerged.
[00:37:14.555 --> 00:37:24.822]  And as you're listening to this, ask yourself, if this was in the city, if this was the cops against a black individual, wouldn't we hear that this is all about racism?
[00:37:25.682 --> 00:37:26.903]  Racism, racism, racism.
[00:37:26.924 --> 00:37:28.165]  That's all they would want to talk about.
[00:37:28.205 --> 00:37:32.769]  Black Lives Matter would be there, and that would be the only thing they'd want to talk about.
[00:37:32.889 --> 00:37:42.877]  But understand that this event, even though it's a bull, even though it's out in the country that the bull started it, it wasn't over selling loose cigarettes on the sidewalk.
[00:37:43.318 --> 00:37:45.319]  It was about a bull that had been hit by a car.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.763]  Understand that there wasn't any law broken here, even.
[00:37:50.664 --> 00:37:51.465]  But a man died.
[00:37:52.455 --> 00:37:55.950]  Because of the way the police have been trained to interact with the public.
[00:37:57.096 --> 00:38:15.886]  And so understand as you're listening to the details of this, compare this to what you've seen in the public and in the cities and understand that this is not a problem of racism as Black Lives Matter, as George Soros would like to balkanize us into different tribes to keep us from doing anything about this to address the root cause of that.
[00:38:15.926 --> 00:38:22.190]  And if you're looking at this, you can see this is the location where everybody was based on eyewitness reports.
[00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:24.051]  So you can kind of leave that up there as I'm
[00:38:24.971 --> 00:38:28.475]  Going through this report here for people who want to see how everybody was placed there.
[00:38:28.815 --> 00:38:34.181]  They say over 200 residents from the town of Council voiced concerns over the death of Jack Yantis.
[00:38:34.201 --> 00:38:42.309]  I'm reading from an InfoWars article that was on Wednesday from a Don Salazar angered residents grill sheriff on why deputies gunned down Idaho rancher.
[00:38:42.329 --> 00:38:43.870]  If you want to find that on our website.
[00:38:44.471 --> 00:38:48.814]  Says they left the assembly angry over the answers that the county sheriff gave them.
[00:38:48.834 --> 00:38:54.077]  They said police first claimed that Yantis, 62 years old, engaged in a firefight with sheriff's deputies.
[00:38:54.137 --> 00:38:57.839]  But Yantis' daughter, Sarah, says there was no such gunfight.
[00:38:57.859 --> 00:39:04.264]  Instead, called the altercation a senseless murder, the result of police needlessly escalating the situation.
[00:39:04.884 --> 00:39:08.406]  She said, she told the Idaho Statesman, there was no shootout.
[00:39:08.826 --> 00:39:10.708]  This was a senseless murder.
[00:39:11.556 --> 00:39:17.706]  Now, if you're looking at this map, what happened was they called him from his dinner table, said his bull had been hit by a car.
[00:39:18.267 --> 00:39:19.709]  The bull had a broken leg.
[00:39:19.729 --> 00:39:20.871]  It was not going to survive.
[00:39:20.911 --> 00:39:21.773]  It had to be put down.
[00:39:23.454 --> 00:39:45.616]  uh... so what they did was they uh... they actually the uh... son-in-law says that he was there at the time and he said uh... he was getting together the truck and loading that up but he said the deputy started shooting at the bull at least one of them had a semi-automatic rifle perhaps an AR-15 he said they opened up with their pistols and with their M16s before Jack the Rancher got there
[00:39:46.297 --> 00:39:47.537]  He says that's inhumane.
[00:39:48.138 --> 00:39:52.799]  This is a two-ton Angus bull that is angry, hurt, psychotic.
[00:39:53.159 --> 00:39:58.801]  It was blazing down there and it sounded like World War III on this bull because they got him charging at everyone again.
[00:39:58.901 --> 00:40:03.422]  So they just made the situation worse by shooting him, not trying to put him down.
[00:40:03.522 --> 00:40:05.622]  So they say Jack Yantis gets there.
[00:40:05.662 --> 00:40:08.963]  He knows how to put the bull down with one shot in the back of the head.
[00:40:09.023 --> 00:40:13.925]  He's standing about four feet from the bull, aiming the rifle at the back of the bull's head.
[00:40:14.665 --> 00:40:20.851]  His back was to two deputies who were standing in the far lane facing each other as if they were having a conversation.
[00:40:21.632 --> 00:40:32.622]  At that point, the son-in-law, Paris, says, I put the skid loader's lights on him and the bull, lined up to shoot the bull in the back of the head, put him out humanely, says everything was going as planned, then one cop turned around,
[00:40:33.303 --> 00:40:36.024]  And grabbed the rancher's shoulders and jerked him back.
[00:40:36.565 --> 00:40:45.589]  He says he's not sure if the rancher's weapon accidentally just charged at this point, or if the gun fired when the deputy's bullet struck the rifle and Yantis' hand.
[00:40:46.089 --> 00:40:49.991]  Regardless, one deputy began shooting at Yantis, then the other deputy started shooting.
[00:40:50.351 --> 00:40:54.353]  Yantis fell to the ground, injured from gunshots to the chest and to the abdomen.
[00:40:54.913 --> 00:40:58.275]  Now, his wife is also there, as well as his son-in-law.
[00:40:59.755 --> 00:41:00.835]  She suffered a heart attack.
[00:41:01.416 --> 00:41:06.177]  She said to the media that she was mistreated by the officers after watching her husband shot.
[00:41:06.237 --> 00:41:09.078]  She said they tried to run to his aid as he fell.
[00:41:09.318 --> 00:41:10.139]  They shot him in the chest.
[00:41:10.159 --> 00:41:10.879]  He falls to the ground.
[00:41:10.899 --> 00:41:11.399]  He's bleeding.
[00:41:11.799 --> 00:41:12.460]  They tried to run.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.321]  She says they threatened, then threatened me and my nephew.
[00:41:15.601 --> 00:41:17.641]  They threw us in the middle of Highway 95.
[00:41:17.681 --> 00:41:18.322]  They searched us.
[00:41:18.342 --> 00:41:19.122]  They handcuffed us.
[00:41:19.142 --> 00:41:21.983]  They wouldn't let us go and take care of Jack.
[00:41:22.243 --> 00:41:25.564]  And they wouldn't call any ambulance to the scene.
[00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:51.267]  Think about that situation where you had the the uh... rookie and the cop and they were going up and down the stairway and uh... stairwell in a New York apartment project low-income government apartment project and so they have police patrolling because it's a high crime area and a man and his girlfriend or wife open the door of the stairwell and walk in and the
[00:41:52.429 --> 00:41:55.352]  One of the cops immediately pulls out a gun and shoots him in the chest.
[00:41:56.153 --> 00:42:00.498]  As the guy is laying there bleeding out, they call the union.
[00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:01.779]  The police union.
[00:42:01.859 --> 00:42:02.720]  Not an ambulance.
[00:42:03.061 --> 00:42:05.083]  They don't try to offer any assistance themselves.
[00:42:05.343 --> 00:42:06.785]  They don't even call for help.
[00:42:08.103 --> 00:42:10.646]  They call their union reps and say, hey, I shot a guy.
[00:42:10.666 --> 00:42:12.988]  Because they know that they did the wrong thing.
[00:42:13.849 --> 00:42:23.639]  And what you've got going on there, now that was a cop who was not black who shot a black man and killed him and let him bleed out in the stairwell.
[00:42:23.679 --> 00:42:24.820]  So, it's about racism.
[00:42:25.481 --> 00:42:26.962]  Well, where's the racism in this?
[00:42:27.363 --> 00:42:31.166]  Exactly the same types of things we see happening, just minor variations.
[00:42:31.226 --> 00:42:33.167]  It's a rural setting instead of a city setting.
[00:42:33.568 --> 00:42:41.915]  But still, the cops use excessive force, shooting first, and then let the people who are shot bleed out without even calling any help.
[00:42:43.089 --> 00:42:44.891]  It is not about race.
[00:42:45.611 --> 00:42:49.474]  It is about, there is an element of racism and things, understand.
[00:42:49.815 --> 00:42:53.858]  But it is fundamentally about the differences in the way the police have been trained.
[00:42:53.898 --> 00:42:59.843]  And unless we come together, black and white, and stop this, they're going to continue to keep killing us.
[00:43:00.023 --> 00:43:01.064]  Now, they have a meeting.
[00:43:01.785 --> 00:43:02.665]  They pull everybody together.
[00:43:02.686 --> 00:43:05.268]  The sheriff was asked whether the deputies were wearing body cameras.
[00:43:05.288 --> 00:43:08.150]  He says, well, I don't know if the body cameras were recording the incident.
[00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:09.311]  This has been over a week.
[00:43:09.391 --> 00:43:10.212]  He doesn't know.
[00:43:10.752 --> 00:43:11.293]  He doesn't know.
[00:43:12.318 --> 00:43:21.322]  And as they pointed out, look, I pay taxes for these body cameras, they're for our protection and for the deputies' protection if they're not doing the wrong thing.
[00:43:22.062 --> 00:43:29.525]  This is absolutely insane, but we see this everywhere, from rural Idaho to New York City, the center of the city.
[00:43:30.165 --> 00:43:38.749]  This is because it is a federal agenda, the way they are training the police to interact with the public, and this is what we really have to be concerned about.
[00:43:39.673 --> 00:43:51.762]  Now in this particular case I think things are going to happen out there because unlike the city where people are polarized and think it's because of who they are or don't care because it's not their group.
[00:43:51.782 --> 00:43:59.728]  So if you tell people this is all about the police going after black people you know what there's a lot of people who are going to look at this quite frankly and say well I'm not black so I don't care.
[00:44:00.882 --> 00:44:05.524]  You're not going to get this situation solved if you make it about race.
[00:44:06.084 --> 00:44:13.587]  And, of course, George Soros and the people who are pushing Black Lives Matter, as well as the government police organizations, don't want the problem solved.
[00:44:14.127 --> 00:44:16.788]  So they would love for you to think that this is simply about race.
[00:44:17.308 --> 00:44:21.170]  They don't want people to come together and address these fundamental concerns.
[00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:23.911]  Absolutely outrageous situation.
[00:44:23.951 --> 00:44:25.792]  And I think something's going to change out there, though.
[00:44:25.812 --> 00:44:27.873]  They're going to have, it's a small
[00:44:29.292 --> 00:44:32.634]  Small city, small town, Council, Idaho.
[00:44:32.694 --> 00:44:33.274]  But you know what?
[00:44:33.794 --> 00:44:35.215]  Gary Spence is coming.
[00:44:35.895 --> 00:44:39.937]  Gary Spence, the lawyer who has never lost a criminal trial.
[00:44:40.658 --> 00:44:43.699]  Gary Spence, who defended Randy Weaver.
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:45.860]  He's gonna be there.
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.982]  He also was involved in the Karen Silkwood case.
[00:44:49.022 --> 00:44:50.622]  He's had a lot of high-profile cases.
[00:44:51.123 --> 00:44:51.603]  And you know what?
[00:44:51.683 --> 00:44:55.465]  He doesn't like it when the government does this kind of thing.
[00:44:56.533 --> 00:45:04.719]  He's there for the poor, for the people who are being treated as slaves by our corporate government, and he's going to make these people pay if he gets involved, I can tell you that.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:09.223]  Let's take a look at what's going on with the TPP.
[00:45:10.524 --> 00:45:20.071]  We have this clip from the debate, guys pull that clip up, where they're going back and forth talking about the TPP on the debate.
[00:45:22.346 --> 00:45:37.153]  Of course, it was reported by many news outlets that Rand Paul got the best of Donald Trump on this, because he pointed out, as Donald Trump was discussing the trade situation with the TPP and with China, he pointed out, well, you know, the TPP doesn't include China.
[00:45:38.374 --> 00:45:43.356]  But I think that Rand Paul avoided talking about the issue, quite frankly.
[00:45:43.877 --> 00:45:49.760]  I think it's very important to talk about the real issue that's going on
[00:45:50.805 --> 00:45:53.067]  And of course, the real issue is China.
[00:45:54.087 --> 00:45:56.889]  TPP is being offered to us as a solution to China.
[00:45:56.909 --> 00:45:59.511]  And that's what I said with our live coverage of the debate.
[00:45:59.551 --> 00:46:10.158]  I thought it was a brilliant strategy by the Trump campaign to put out on the day of the debate his US-China trade reform bill.
[00:46:10.318 --> 00:46:12.760]  Because that is the core problem right there.
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.462]  And he went down various aspects of the
[00:46:16.062 --> 00:46:16.463]  We're good to go.
[00:46:35.505 --> 00:46:47.890]  Of course, there's been recent articles about how that affects the military and industrial complex here, having to turn over their secrets to the Chinese, to companies that were run by former Chinese military.
[00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:50.631]  So Donald Trump identified the problem.
[00:46:50.691 --> 00:46:53.172]  I'm not really sure what he's going to do about it.
[00:46:53.752 --> 00:46:56.074]  You know, he says he's a great negotiator, so he's going to take care of it.
[00:46:56.094 --> 00:46:58.717]  But at least he understands what the problem is, just like with immigration.
[00:46:58.857 --> 00:46:59.818]  He understands what the problem is.
[00:46:59.838 --> 00:47:01.299]  I don't think a wall is a solution.
[00:47:01.679 --> 00:47:05.923]  I think we've got to stop drawing people in with the free goodies.
[00:47:06.564 --> 00:47:12.609]  As long as there's a giant vacuum sucking people in, promising them free goodies, we're not going to be able to stop them with a wall.
[00:47:12.629 --> 00:47:17.634]  But at least he understands what the problem is, and he's willing to talk about that.
[00:47:18.413 --> 00:47:22.118]  So, they were going back and forth, they asked about the TPP, and this is Trump's answer.
[00:47:22.159 --> 00:47:23.741]  He says, the TPP is a horrible idea.
[00:47:23.761 --> 00:47:26.064]  It's a deal that's going to lead to nothing but trouble.
[00:47:26.164 --> 00:47:30.390]  It's a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door.
[00:47:31.372 --> 00:47:34.376]  And that's precisely what Senator Sessions has said.
[00:47:35.037 --> 00:47:37.539]  He said, yeah, China's not a part of this deal right now.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:40.863]  But you understand that this deal was written in secret.
[00:47:41.303 --> 00:47:43.906]  It's going to be presented on a very short time frame.
[00:47:43.946 --> 00:47:47.869]  The Congress is not going to have any time to make any amendments to it.
[00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:49.331]  It'll be a straight up and down vote.
[00:47:49.431 --> 00:47:58.360]  And once it is in, it will be changed on a continuing basis by an international committee that is not accountable to anyone in America.
[00:47:58.996 --> 00:48:07.923]  No one who is elected, they may not be accountable to any government, they will be able to change all the terms of the agreement at will.
[00:48:07.943 --> 00:48:14.248]  So it really doesn't even matter what's in these 6,000 pages, because they could change it all the very next day.
[00:48:14.268 --> 00:48:15.449]  The very next day.
[00:48:15.889 --> 00:48:18.872]  And they could add whatever country they want to the very next day.
[00:48:20.051 --> 00:48:23.295]  So, when you talk about the fact that, you know, I think Donald Trump gets it.
[00:48:23.315 --> 00:48:28.220]  He says this is designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and to take advantage of everyone.
[00:48:28.261 --> 00:48:31.484]  He says it's 5,600 pages long, so complex that nobody's read it.
[00:48:31.544 --> 00:48:32.425]  It's like Obamacare.
[00:48:32.465 --> 00:48:33.527]  Nobody ever read it.
[00:48:33.927 --> 00:48:34.488]  They passed it.
[00:48:34.548 --> 00:48:35.088]  Nobody read it.
[00:48:35.128 --> 00:48:36.049]  Now look at the mess we have.
[00:48:36.866 --> 00:48:37.286]  Exactly.
[00:48:37.626 --> 00:48:39.627]  Except this is going to be even worse.
[00:48:40.007 --> 00:48:46.928]  Because this is a deal that, once it is finished, is going to be changed at will by a transnational committee.
[00:48:46.968 --> 00:48:55.710]  That's why Jeff Sessions, Senator Sessions says, when he read this, he says, you are creating an economic and political union just like the European Union.
[00:48:56.271 --> 00:49:01.532]  And you have absolutely no representation in this committee that is going to be making the rules.
[00:49:02.432 --> 00:49:03.534]  That's what they're setting up.
[00:49:03.574 --> 00:49:10.622]  They're setting up global governance with that, with the climate treaties, as they tear down our national borders with open immigration.
[00:49:11.621 --> 00:49:15.342]  And so the New American points out that Trump was correct about the TPP in China.
[00:49:15.863 --> 00:49:22.105]  And even though Rand Paul came in and said, hey, Gerard, you know, we might want to point out that China is not part of this deal, everybody laughed.
[00:49:22.545 --> 00:49:26.667]  The New York Times said that Trump was the butt of a joke, but that's not really true.
[00:49:26.747 --> 00:49:30.468]  I think he had the core issue there all along.
[00:49:31.348 --> 00:49:34.350]  Also, some other news in terms of the
[00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:44.938]  Federal Reserve, we were talking about money earlier, and the fact that the Apple CEO says, tells college kids, your kids will not even know what cash is.
[00:49:44.958 --> 00:49:47.140]  Well, they don't really understand what money is now.
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:51.863]  The college students that are there, the adults that live in our society don't really understand what money is.
[00:49:52.244 --> 00:49:57.088]  In November, Senator Paul introduced a Bring Accountability Now to the Fed Act.
[00:49:57.987 --> 00:50:01.689]  One provision of which would forbid the Fed or any of its officials from lobbying.
[00:50:02.369 --> 00:50:11.013]  You understand that while they're trying to audit the Fed, while they're trying to get information about what they do, how they do it, I mean, we know what they do.
[00:50:11.033 --> 00:50:12.574]  We know that they're manipulating interest rates.
[00:50:12.594 --> 00:50:17.596]  We know that they're deciding whether they want to increase the money supply or decrease the money supply.
[00:50:17.616 --> 00:50:21.698]  I mean, that gives them incredible leverage over the economy.
[00:50:21.698 --> 00:50:22.198]  We're good to go.
[00:50:40.222 --> 00:50:46.287]  So, Rand Paul has pushed back and saying, well, here's a bill that would stop the Fed from doing lobbying.
[00:50:46.928 --> 00:50:54.534]  He says, the Federal Reserve, as an entity of the government and operating under authority granted by Congress, should not use its funds to lobby the members of Congress.
[00:50:54.654 --> 00:50:55.255]  Well, you know what?
[00:50:55.295 --> 00:50:56.636]  It's not an entity of the government.
[00:50:56.656 --> 00:50:59.238]  That's the thing that concerns me, and Rand Paul should know that.
[00:50:59.618 --> 00:51:03.101]  There's nothing that is federal about the Federal Reserve.
[00:51:03.181 --> 00:51:04.983]  It's no more federal than Federal Express.
[00:51:05.043 --> 00:51:06.304]  They have been given a monopoly.
[00:51:06.564 --> 00:51:07.825]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[00:51:07.865 --> 00:51:08.306]  Stay with us.

[00:52:09.739 --> 00:52:18.442]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[00:52:18.642 --> 00:52:19.582]  Silver Lungs.
[00:52:19.722 --> 00:52:26.845]  With the addition of our unique lung delivery system, respiratory infections are targeted directly, where traditional oral administration simply cannot reach.
[00:52:27.025 --> 00:52:32.927]  This pioneering method also preserves the original particle sizes and delivers your silver solution directly into the bloodstream.
[00:52:33.047 --> 00:52:37.108]  See the Silver Lungs generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.
[00:52:37.188 --> 00:52:38.909]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[00:52:39.329 --> 00:52:42.070]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:44.991]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:52:45.011 --> 00:52:45.432]  Croix River.
[00:52:45.752 --> 00:52:47.752]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:52:47.993 --> 00:52:50.714]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:52:50.954 --> 00:52:51.454]  His excuse?
[00:52:51.474 --> 00:52:52.894]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:52:53.155 --> 00:52:54.455]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:52:54.775 --> 00:53:00.277]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[00:53:00.518 --> 00:53:01.258]  Don't wait.
[00:53:01.558 --> 00:53:03.939]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now.
[00:53:04.219 --> 00:53:06.460]  For not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.321]  Again, that's LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:53:09.272 --> 00:53:12.275]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[00:53:12.575 --> 00:53:17.741]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[00:53:18.061 --> 00:53:19.983]  But they're about to lose control.
[00:53:20.343 --> 00:53:25.328]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[00:53:25.668 --> 00:53:30.133]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:53:30.253 --> 00:53:32.275]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:53:32.635 --> 00:53:36.138]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[00:53:36.479 --> 00:53:40.562]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[00:53:41.003 --> 00:53:46.548]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves, but this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:53:46.728 --> 00:53:48.129]  This will affect us all.
[00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:52.073]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[00:53:53.294 --> 00:53:59.536]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.
[00:53:59.676 --> 00:54:05.578]  You can watch the video for free right now by going to DollarDanger.com.
[00:54:05.798 --> 00:54:07.799]  Again, that's DollarDanger.com.
[00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:25.233]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight.
[00:54:25.753 --> 00:54:28.936]  Joining us in the next hour will be our InfoWars crew.
[00:54:29.356 --> 00:54:35.501]  Joe Biggs, Sha'Carri Jackson, Leanne McAdoo, we'll be talking about Joe Biggs' report here at the University of Texas where he
[00:54:37.382 --> 00:54:41.325]  Interviewed and covered the students who are demanding free public college.
[00:54:41.426 --> 00:54:54.376]  They don't like the fact that it is expensive, that they're getting loaded with debt, essentially becoming indentured servants for the rest of their lives because most of the degrees that kids get in college nowadays really don't increase their earning potential.
[00:54:55.317 --> 00:54:58.319]  You want to get a degree in law or medicine or engineering or something?
[00:54:58.339 --> 00:54:58.940]  Yeah, that'll help you.
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:01.222]  But you want to get a degree in political science?
[00:55:01.442 --> 00:55:02.283]  Nah, not so much.
[00:55:02.603 --> 00:55:06.287]  You're just going to have a big debt that you can't get rid of even if you declare bankruptcy.
[00:55:06.347 --> 00:55:09.530]  But the government wants you to get into debt with that.
[00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:21.601]  They have created this problem by subsidizing colleges and of course they will offer you the carrot of getting rid of your debt if you will do community service for them or maybe work for the government, become a teacher, do something else.
[00:55:21.662 --> 00:55:23.523]  So that's the way that they are
[00:55:24.482 --> 00:55:25.082]  Putting this out.
[00:55:25.123 --> 00:55:26.504]  There's a lot of different flavors of this.
[00:55:26.564 --> 00:55:29.166]  Marco Rubio wants to make this happen for people.
[00:55:29.886 --> 00:55:35.470]  Other socialists, besides Rubio, people like Bernie Sanders want to do it as well.
[00:55:36.171 --> 00:55:37.492]  Hillary Clinton as well.
[00:55:37.552 --> 00:55:39.153]  So we're going to play that report.
[00:55:39.173 --> 00:55:40.154]  We're going to talk to the reporters.
[00:55:40.174 --> 00:55:45.718]  We're also going to talk about questions about what constitutes real news.
[00:55:45.898 --> 00:55:49.241]  When we come back, we'll have the reporters here in the studio with me.
[00:55:49.721 --> 00:55:51.163]  I was just talking about the Federal Reserve.
[00:55:52.065 --> 00:55:58.590]  And about Rand Paul's act to prohibit the Fed from lobbying any of its officials from lobbying.
[00:55:59.451 --> 00:56:08.018]  And I think that's very important because we have to understand that the Fed is trying to do this, is really stepping up the efforts to try to stop anyone from auditing them.
[00:56:08.238 --> 00:56:11.420]  Trying to stop anyone from looking at what they're really doing.
[00:56:11.441 --> 00:56:13.082]  And of course we've seen what they really do.
[00:56:13.122 --> 00:56:20.187]  In a hundred years they have reduced the value of our money to where it takes a dollar to buy what a penny would have bought a hundred years ago.
[00:56:21.334 --> 00:56:25.395]  And that kind of inflation is devastating to savers.
[00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:26.976]  It's devastating to the economy.
[00:56:27.596 --> 00:56:29.856]  They are trashing our money.
[00:56:29.876 --> 00:56:35.898]  And the only reason we haven't had the kind of hyperinflation that you see in socialist countries like Venezuela is because of the petrodollar.
[00:56:35.918 --> 00:56:40.559]  Because we strong-armed people into making us a world reserve currency.
[00:56:40.979 --> 00:56:42.640]  Those days are coming to a close.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:56.312]  And so Rand Paul says, the Federal Reserve, as an entity of the government and operating under authority granted by Congress, should not use its funds to lobby members of Congress or to influence Congress's efforts to create a more transparent, fundamentally sound monetary policy.
[00:56:56.352 --> 00:57:01.336]  Well, you make a more fundamentally sound monetary policy by getting rid of the Fed.
[00:57:02.097 --> 00:57:05.298]  Auditing the Fed is one step in doing that, but you've got to get rid of the Fed.
[00:57:05.478 --> 00:57:10.760]  And Rand should know that the Fed can lobby because the Fed is private.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:13.921]  It is not an entity of the government, as he said.
[00:57:13.941 --> 00:57:15.521]  And I'm very surprised to see him say that.
[00:57:16.361 --> 00:57:18.362]  They can hire lobbyists because they're a private organization.
[00:57:18.382 --> 00:57:24.924]  Let's play what Janet Yellen said about negative interest rates, and she was questioned by Congressman Tom Emmer.
[00:57:25.564 --> 00:57:26.364]  Go a different route.
[00:57:26.404 --> 00:57:28.805]  I don't think anybody has asked you about this this morning.
[00:57:30.224 --> 00:57:34.550]  Will the Federal Open Market Committee ever rule out going to negative interest rates?
[00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:42.682]  Rule out is something we tend not to do.
[00:57:42.702 --> 00:57:48.966]  I don't at the moment see a need for negative interest rates.
[00:57:49.146 --> 00:57:59.852]  The committee is seeing a domestic economy that's been proceeding on a steady path of improvement.
[00:58:00.392 --> 00:58:06.476]  Our focus has been on the possibility that it will be appropriate to begin.
[00:58:09.097 --> 00:58:23.011]  Drudge featured her picture at the top of the Drudge Report with a caption underneath it, clueless, and what he was linking to in the article was Janet Yellen saying that, you know, I think we really need to go back and study the unique things that have been done since 2008 and determine whether or not they work.
[00:58:23.572 --> 00:58:23.812]  Really?
[00:58:24.393 --> 00:58:24.673]  Really?
[00:58:25.193 --> 00:58:28.477]  You know, Ben Carson was asked whether or not he would keep Janet Yellen.
[00:58:28.517 --> 00:58:32.581]  I mean, we should ask whether or not he's going to keep the Fed, but of course he doesn't have a problem with the Fed at all.
[00:58:33.547 --> 00:58:38.029]  And he doesn't have a problem with Janet Yellen because the two of them have connections going back to Yale.
[00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:42.772]  See, Ben Carson is an insider pretending to be an outsider.
[00:58:42.812 --> 00:58:44.373]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with some news.
[00:58:50.436 --> 00:58:52.237]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:03.117 --> 00:59:11.122]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:11.362 --> 00:59:16.526]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:59:41.165 --> 00:59:44.386]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:59:44.646 --> 00:59:46.447]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.

[01:00:15.902 --> 01:00:16.543]  Big Brother.
[01:00:17.203 --> 01:00:18.224]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:18.964 --> 01:00:20.065]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:20.726 --> 01:00:21.526]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.307 --> 01:00:23.248]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.868 --> 01:00:27.471]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.051 --> 01:00:32.114]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.492 --> 01:00:36.673]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:36.693 --> 01:00:37.333]  I'm David Knight.
[01:00:37.693 --> 01:00:41.896]  In the next segment, we're going to have our reporters in here talking about students across the U.S.
[01:00:42.376 --> 01:00:44.578]  marching and demanding free tuition.
[01:00:44.898 --> 01:00:50.521]  And of course, they're going to be demanding it not just for themselves, but for anybody who walks across our borders.
[01:00:50.581 --> 01:00:52.042]  We already see how that is working.
[01:00:52.362 --> 01:00:54.504]  In this segment, I want to cover some news.
[01:00:54.584 --> 01:01:00.307]  We have a report here that Facebook has announced a surge in government demands for personal user data.
[01:01:00.367 --> 01:01:00.868]  Imagine that.
[01:01:01.766 --> 01:01:06.309]  Of course, that's what Facebook and Google were really set up for in the first place, was to turn this information over.
[01:01:06.609 --> 01:01:10.772]  And this is going to do nothing but accelerate dramatically, folks.
[01:01:10.932 --> 01:01:17.256]  They have now passed CISA, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing Security Act.
[01:01:17.316 --> 01:01:18.257]  I forgot what it is.
[01:01:18.277 --> 01:01:22.259]  They took the P out, which was protection, because that was going to protect the
[01:01:23.635 --> 01:01:30.022]  The corporations from any liability when they gave private information about you to the government without a search warrant.
[01:01:30.703 --> 01:01:35.488]  So it was the Cyber Security Information Sharing Act is what they call it now.
[01:01:35.508 --> 01:01:36.609]  Okay, they took the protection out.
[01:01:37.449 --> 01:01:40.772]  They're going to use this now to say, look, you don't have any liability.
[01:01:40.852 --> 01:01:43.274]  People can't sue you for turning the information over to us.
[01:01:43.334 --> 01:01:44.054]  Turn it over now.
[01:01:44.154 --> 01:01:45.936]  You have no reason to not do this.
[01:01:46.176 --> 01:01:50.039]  And if you don't do it, we're going to maybe make it harder for you to do business.
[01:01:50.359 --> 01:01:58.565]  They say requests for user data from governmental organizations as well as content restrictions increased globally the first half of 2015, even before CISA passed.
[01:01:59.006 --> 01:02:01.928]  They say half of the requests came from the United States.
[01:02:02.068 --> 01:02:03.089]  They point out that U.S.
[01:02:03.129 --> 01:02:05.071]  law enforcement agencies have been the most demanding.
[01:02:05.871 --> 01:02:06.192]  U.S.
[01:02:06.352 --> 01:02:10.837]  bureaucracies demanded data from 26,579 accounts.
[01:02:11.058 --> 01:02:16.084]  They say there's also a significant amount of requests coming from the UK, Germany, and France.
[01:02:16.424 --> 01:02:18.807]  Russia totaled one request.
[01:02:19.708 --> 01:02:20.349]  One request.
[01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:21.651]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:02:22.671 --> 01:02:29.419]  You know, we always need to step back and think about the stereotypes that we see in terms of the fact that, you know, we are struggling.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.183]  We've got to rebuild our military, as Marco Rubio said.
[01:02:32.503 --> 01:02:37.289]  You know, as Rand Paul pointed out, we spend more than the next 10 countries combined
[01:02:38.231 --> 01:02:38.972]  On our military.
[01:02:39.672 --> 01:02:40.112]  Rebuild it?
[01:02:40.853 --> 01:02:52.201]  I mean, the only reason that it would not be laying in ruins, which I don't think it is, is because we've been fighting seven wars that have not declared, that we don't need to be involved in under Obama.
[01:02:52.721 --> 01:02:54.523]  But I don't think it needs to be rebuilt.
[01:02:54.803 --> 01:02:56.264]  I don't think it's been deconstructed.
[01:02:57.318 --> 01:02:59.839]  Nevertheless, we have these stereotypes.
[01:03:00.019 --> 01:03:08.144]  You know, those ten nations, of course, include China and Russia and then many other nations, all combined their military budgets are not as much as our military budget.
[01:03:09.044 --> 01:03:13.727]  And then we also have these stereotypes of East Germany, where everybody's being spied on.
[01:03:13.787 --> 01:03:15.628]  No, that would be the United States now.
[01:03:16.328 --> 01:03:20.731]  Or the idea that people get locked up in these gulags or sent to Siberia.
[01:03:20.751 --> 01:03:22.232]  You know, we have more prisoners.
[01:03:23.146 --> 01:03:24.568]  Than any other country.
[01:03:24.708 --> 01:03:27.491]  Far more than any other country because of the war on drugs.
[01:03:27.551 --> 01:03:35.100]  But going back to the fear and paranoia of our government spying on us, I say the amount of content restricted for violating local law increased by 112%.
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:38.404]  That's local law enforcement asking for that.
[01:03:38.444 --> 01:03:38.925]  That went up by 112%.
[01:03:40.426 --> 01:03:47.547]  So it's a big increase by the Feds, 18% compared to the previous year, but that was before they passed CISA.
[01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:49.068]  You're going to see that explode.
[01:03:49.308 --> 01:03:57.629]  Then they pointed out that 15,000 content pieces from India and 4,500 in Turkey were requested to be taken down.
[01:03:58.209 --> 01:04:08.491]  So understand that the US, the UK, Germany and France, they want to spy on you, and India and Turkey really want to just kind of censor the information.
[01:04:09.599 --> 01:04:10.000]  You know what?
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.481]  You need to get off of Facebook.
[01:04:11.541 --> 01:04:13.163]  Julian Assange has warned you about it.
[01:04:13.304 --> 01:04:15.867]  He says it has all your friends wearing a wire for the government.
[01:04:15.907 --> 01:04:16.948]  They will take what you say.
[01:04:17.529 --> 01:04:18.170]  They will twist it.
[01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:19.311]  They will put it out of context.
[01:04:19.351 --> 01:04:22.896]  They will use it to hang you if they decide they want to do that.
[01:04:23.516 --> 01:04:25.199]  And then this report from WND.
[01:04:25.579 --> 01:04:28.443]  Dropping Facebook actually makes people happier.
[01:04:29.003 --> 01:04:33.084]  A stunning new study from Denmark shows that social media distorts reality.
[01:04:33.464 --> 01:04:37.666]  It provides a false perception of what other people are accomplishing in their lives.
[01:04:38.166 --> 01:04:41.487]  And people actually cheer up when they drop their participation.
[01:04:41.967 --> 01:04:46.408]  They found with a metric, they said 7.56 average at the beginning of the study.
[01:04:46.428 --> 01:04:51.469]  If people said they were happy, then they had happiness rose to an average of 8.12 after just one week.
[01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:54.932]  Of getting rid of Facebook.
[01:04:55.572 --> 01:04:56.534]  Stay with us when we come back.
[01:04:56.554 --> 01:04:58.095]  We're going to be joined by reporters.
[01:04:58.115 --> 01:04:59.217]  We're going to talk about the media.
[01:04:59.257 --> 01:05:01.980]  We're going to talk about the press for socialism.
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:06.846]  Yes, start with the college students demanding a free ride at school.
[01:05:06.906 --> 01:05:07.566]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:09.898 --> 01:05:12.221]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:05:12.401 --> 01:05:16.105]  Rand Paul calls Obama an idiot on foreign policy.
[01:05:16.125 --> 01:05:21.191]  What kind of idiot sends four people to war in a campaign stop in Iowa yesterday?
[01:05:21.291 --> 01:05:29.000]  Senator Rand Paul had some choice words for the president, labeling him an idiot over his handling of the situation in Syria.
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.061]  Bravo, Rand Paul.
[01:05:30.241 --> 01:05:30.562]  Bravo.
[01:05:30.802 --> 01:05:37.107]  Speaking to the crowd on military and foreign policy, Paul asks, what kind of idiot sends four people to war?
[01:05:37.247 --> 01:05:43.372]  The senator was referring to Obama's monumental fail in attempting to train Syrian rebels to fight ISIS.
[01:05:43.492 --> 01:05:53.560]  The program cost an estimated $500 million, but was aborted as it was revealed that just four or five trainers remained from an initial 54.
[01:05:54.401 --> 01:05:57.884]  If you go to war, you don't go with underwhelming force, you go to war with
[01:05:58.104 --> 01:06:00.765]  Overwhelming force, Paul further explained.
[01:06:00.885 --> 01:06:05.626]  Paul also spoke on arming the rebels, calling it crazy foolish to feed arms to people who ate us.

[01:06:09.588 --> 01:06:10.368]  Alex Jones here.

[01:07:12.708 --> 01:07:22.095]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:07:22.436 --> 01:07:24.998]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:07:25.138 --> 01:07:28.480]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:34.705]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[01:07:35.025 --> 01:07:39.869]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:07:40.149 --> 01:07:46.314]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:07:46.534 --> 01:07:54.000]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:08:01.546]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:08:12.119 --> 01:08:14.326]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:14.908 --> 01:08:17.697]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:34.048 --> 01:08:35.349]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:35.409 --> 01:08:49.882]  I'm David Knight and joining me in studio are Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo and Joe Biggs and we're going to play Joe's report that he filmed at the University of Texas talking to students who are demanding that they get free college education.
[01:08:49.902 --> 01:08:50.983]  Tell us a little bit about that Joe.
[01:08:51.806 --> 01:08:53.988]  Yeah, so we were going out to cover this Million Student March.
[01:08:54.008 --> 01:08:55.589]  By the time we got there, it already was over.
[01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:58.172]  We saw some people, you know, in little groups.
[01:08:58.192 --> 01:09:00.854]  We're like, you know, let's just go out and do a man on the street, talk to some people.
[01:09:01.435 --> 01:09:02.956]  I'm sure there's going to be some good stuff out here.
[01:09:02.976 --> 01:09:07.961]  So sure enough, you know, a lot of people out there, they want you to pay for their college.
[01:09:08.001 --> 01:09:10.803]  They don't want to work hard for it, just like my parents did.
[01:09:10.903 --> 01:09:12.865]  They had part-time jobs.
[01:09:12.885 --> 01:09:13.766]  They worked their way through college.
[01:09:13.786 --> 01:09:14.426]  They paid it off.
[01:09:15.007 --> 01:09:16.949]  You know, they did everything they could.
[01:09:18.069 --> 01:09:20.010]  To support themselves and get that education.
[01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:23.572]  And now we have these entitled kids who just think that everything should be free.
[01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:25.574]  That's why Bernie Sanders is so popular.
[01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:32.998]  And just like Kit Daniels said yesterday when we were speaking, he's like, if everyone has a degree, then it's a saturated market.
[01:09:33.738 --> 01:09:35.459]  Now you don't stand out at all.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:42.684]  How are you going to stand out between those who don't have a degree and then you having one if everyone has one?
[01:09:43.044 --> 01:09:47.127]  Then they're just going to have to implement some other kind of program to make you stand out and you're going to have to pay for that and do that.
[01:09:48.047 --> 01:09:52.993]  That's what I'm saying too, that a lot of these degrees aren't really going to increase your income earning potential.
[01:09:53.193 --> 01:09:56.376]  Or your chances of even getting a job in the field that you're liberal arts degree.
[01:09:56.396 --> 01:09:58.599]  Yeah, there aren't even enough jobs for everyone.
[01:09:58.619 --> 01:10:02.183]  We're just going to have a bunch of overly educated people with nothing to do.
[01:10:02.503 --> 01:10:02.864]  That's right.
[01:10:02.884 --> 01:10:03.705]  Let's run that report.
[01:10:10.595 --> 01:10:17.241]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com and today we are at the University of Texas in Austin yet again.
[01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:30.734]  Today there is a Million Man March that happened all over the country where students are asking for free college, they want their debt removed, and they also want all employees to get paid $15 an hour.
[01:10:31.354 --> 01:10:34.637]  Now where I come from, if I apply for a loan, I have to pay that back.
[01:10:35.038 --> 01:10:36.179]  That's just kind of how that works.
[01:10:37.281 --> 01:10:43.325]  Here's the thing though, this is what the stupid liberal politically correct students out there have to understand.
[01:10:43.766 --> 01:10:45.227]  If your college is free, guess what?
[01:10:45.247 --> 01:10:46.708]  That means someone else has to pay for it.
[01:10:47.088 --> 01:10:49.710]  So I'm going to ask people about that, ask them if they agree with free college.
[01:10:50.010 --> 01:10:55.314]  And then if they do, ask them to take over my car payment, my mortgage payment, and things like that and see how they react.
[01:10:55.595 --> 01:10:59.597]  So let's go out here and talk to people and find out what's really going on with this Million Man March.
[01:11:00.398 --> 01:11:02.079]  Do you think it's good to have free college?
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.562]  Yeah, I definitely think free college would be great.
[01:11:06.469 --> 01:11:11.030]  Uh, in other countries they have free college and it works out really well for them.
[01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:12.310]  That'd be awesome.
[01:11:13.351 --> 01:11:14.631]  If it's possible, I don't know.
[01:11:14.651 --> 01:11:16.111]  Why wouldn't it be possible?
[01:11:16.911 --> 01:11:19.592]  I mean, tuition is super expensive as it is.
[01:11:19.612 --> 01:11:21.392]  And that means somebody's gotta pay for it, right?
[01:11:21.992 --> 01:11:33.995]  Yeah, but, I mean, if you think about it this way, free college tuition wouldn't mean less college debt, and there would be a lot more people utilizing their degrees better, so...
[01:11:34.972 --> 01:11:40.217]  Alright, so it'd be less student debt for the individual, but then at the same time, that's still going to come out of taxes and all that.
[01:11:40.237 --> 01:11:43.280]  So that means I'm paying for your college, he's paying for your college and all that.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:44.941]  Yeah, well, I mean... You think that's alright?
[01:11:45.081 --> 01:11:45.922]  I think that's alright.
[01:11:45.962 --> 01:11:47.443]  You're paying for a lot of stuff right now.
[01:11:47.483 --> 01:11:51.267]  You're paying for... If I were to have a child and send him to public school, you'd be paying for his school.
[01:11:52.727 --> 01:11:54.748]  But I'm saying you want to keep adding more and more on to that.
[01:11:54.788 --> 01:11:57.368]  I mean this whole idea that everything can be free.
[01:11:57.809 --> 01:12:00.249]  The point I'm trying to get across is nothing's free.
[01:12:00.269 --> 01:12:01.529]  We're moving towards socialism.
[01:12:01.569 --> 01:12:02.590]  Is that what you're getting to?
[01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:03.830]  Do you agree with that?
[01:12:03.850 --> 01:12:04.790]  Yeah, and I agree with that.
[01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:05.770]  You agree with socialism?
[01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:06.831]  Let's go Scandinavian.
[01:12:07.051 --> 01:12:07.831]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:12:07.891 --> 01:12:08.571]  So you feel the Bern?
[01:12:09.811 --> 01:12:10.071]  Bernie?
[01:12:10.532 --> 01:12:11.392]  Yeah, I feel the Bernie.
[01:12:11.612 --> 01:12:12.732]  I feel the Bernie for sure.
[01:12:13.092 --> 01:12:14.192]  So you agree with free school?
[01:12:14.593 --> 01:12:16.373]  So who do you think is going to be paying for it then?
[01:12:17.193 --> 01:12:18.073]  Taxes, the 1%.
[01:12:19.914 --> 01:12:20.514]  I pay taxes.
[01:12:21.328 --> 01:12:21.788]  Yes.
[01:12:21.868 --> 01:12:23.429]  Yeah, everyone pays taxes to pay for it.
[01:12:23.909 --> 01:12:37.577]  I think since we have like, you know, public education until up to high school, and it's really like critical to, you know, get a college degree, I think it should be, you know, provided by the government, you know, and we pay taxes for that also, so.
[01:12:39.309 --> 01:12:46.375]  Well, our education is really suffering compared to other countries, such as Denmark, who gives their students free and they also pay their students to come to college.
[01:12:47.035 --> 01:12:50.578]  Their students are given about $900 a month to go to college.
[01:12:51.238 --> 01:12:53.520]  So, you know, some stuff's working.
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:56.222]  We're not really number one in education.
[01:12:56.242 --> 01:12:58.744]  I'm not necessarily sure how I feel about free college.
[01:12:58.864 --> 01:13:00.866]  I'm very much behind free community college.
[01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:07.912]  I just, I feel like free college is a great idea, but it's also probably a bad idea, just depending on where that money's coming from.
[01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:09.333]  And why do you think it's a bad idea?
[01:13:09.913 --> 01:13:11.213]  Well, where would that money be coming from?
[01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:17.896]  I mean, I guess free college sounds nice and, uh, like an idea, but it's kinda unrealistic, so... Thank you, and now why is that?
[01:13:18.496 --> 01:13:21.497]  I mean, free college, I guess someone's gotta pay for that free college.
[01:13:21.677 --> 01:13:23.638]  Exactly, that's what we're trying to get through most of these people's heads.
[01:13:23.658 --> 01:13:25.419]  So who do you think that's gonna, who's gonna be paying for that?
[01:13:25.899 --> 01:13:29.760]  Well, there's taxpayers, so like, me eventually at some point, whenever I leave my parents.
[01:13:30.621 --> 01:13:30.821]  So...
[01:13:31.522 --> 01:13:38.066]  I probably think it'd be nice to get free college at some point, but like, it's pretty unrealistic and would just cost me more in the long run.
[01:13:38.106 --> 01:13:42.770]  Alright, as you can see, a lot of people want free college, and they really don't care about it.
[01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:48.053]  Even though the fact that that burden's gonna get passed on to someone else, they don't care whatsoever.
[01:13:48.353 --> 01:13:49.594]  It's all about the free stuff.
[01:13:49.994 --> 01:13:51.876]  Everybody seems like they're feeling the burn.
[01:13:52.276 --> 01:13:56.699]  Bernie Sanders has taken the term, Land of the Free, to a whole nother level.
[01:13:56.999 --> 01:14:01.282]  Now we just have to take the brave away and add PCP for Politically Correct Pansies.
[01:14:01.822 --> 01:14:03.884]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[01:14:30.663 --> 01:14:37.468]  And the interesting thing about that, because Joe, you were talking about this, before that report, they were actually having a fight for 15 March.
[01:14:37.508 --> 01:14:39.229]  That's something to raise the minimum wage.
[01:14:39.549 --> 01:14:46.834]  So here's a guy, maybe he wasn't at the march, but they had just rallied to have a higher rate wage while they say, well, let's just increase taxes.
[01:14:47.174 --> 01:14:50.436]  So if they increase taxes, your $15 isn't going to be worth anything.
[01:14:50.496 --> 01:14:52.698]  And that's that's the point you're always bringing up.
[01:14:52.918 --> 01:14:53.118]  Yeah.
[01:14:53.479 --> 01:14:54.459]  I mean, you know, why not?
[01:14:54.579 --> 01:14:55.580]  What's the magic number about 15?
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.742]  I mean, make it $150 an hour.
[01:14:58.182 --> 01:14:59.584]  Let's all be as wealthy as lawyers.
[01:14:59.604 --> 01:15:00.464]  Okay?
[01:15:00.645 --> 01:15:01.866]  Or make it $1,500 an hour.
[01:15:01.966 --> 01:15:03.647]  We can all be as wealthy as Nancy Pelosi.
[01:15:03.907 --> 01:15:08.571]  I mean, you know, the bottom line is, this is just nothing but quantitative easing for the masses.
[01:15:09.032 --> 01:15:09.152]  Okay?
[01:15:09.212 --> 01:15:10.273]  It's the same thing they do.
[01:15:10.773 --> 01:15:20.821]  The Fed, not the government, but the Fed prints all this money to create a false sense of prosperity, and of course that money gets funneled into the Wall Street coffers, but nevertheless,
[01:15:21.582 --> 01:15:23.223]  It doesn't help anybody, okay?
[01:15:23.263 --> 01:15:30.889]  It actually makes us worse off, and it's not going to help anybody to give this minimum wage out there, because it's just going to cause everything to go up.
[01:15:30.929 --> 01:15:32.510]  It's just going to release a new wave of inflation.
[01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:33.250]  Well, a lot of this is because of TV.
[01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:34.451]  It's going to cause some people to get fired.
[01:15:34.471 --> 01:15:35.312]  A lot of this is because of TV.
[01:15:35.332 --> 01:15:36.733]  You've got, like, the Kardashian show.
[01:15:36.753 --> 01:15:37.333]  They're all rich.
[01:15:37.353 --> 01:15:37.973]  They got stuff.
[01:15:38.013 --> 01:15:38.814]  Everyone sees that.
[01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:39.374]  They want it.
[01:15:39.795 --> 01:15:44.518]  Every commercial is like a brand new commercial for a new diamond ring, a new Mercedes, something like that.
[01:15:44.818 --> 01:15:46.479]  And everyone's like, well, I make $7 an hour.
[01:15:46.519 --> 01:15:49.762]  If I make $15 an hour, I can buy these things that I really need that'll make me happy.
[01:15:50.342 --> 01:15:52.464]  And they're never going to get that, and it's just programmed to happen.
[01:15:52.544 --> 01:15:59.951]  It's also people not living within their means, because you go to these campuses, you see guys walking around with Jordans and Beats, which are basically Jordans for your head.
[01:16:00.172 --> 01:16:03.915]  You're not living within your realm of responsibility anyway.
[01:16:03.935 --> 01:16:06.518]  Well, nobody likes to work for anything anymore, though.
[01:16:06.858 --> 01:16:13.845]  It's an entitlement society where everything just comes to you so quickly and easily, and so nobody wants to do the work that it takes to get
[01:16:14.145 --> 01:16:14.606]  Well, it is.
[01:16:14.786 --> 01:16:15.427]  It is harder.
[01:16:15.667 --> 01:16:26.240]  If they wanted to get a job, it would be harder for them to get a job because we've got so many people coming in, adults, who want a career at McDonald's because that is a step up in standard of living from the country that they came from.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.304]  And they need to ask themselves, why is college so expensive?
[01:16:29.784 --> 01:16:32.446]  As I pointed out earlier in the program, I was able to go to college.
[01:16:32.766 --> 01:16:33.687]  My wife went to college.
[01:16:33.767 --> 01:16:38.470]  I went to a state school, so the tuition was less than what I spent on books, okay?
[01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:41.171]  And you could support yourself with a part-time job.
[01:16:41.251 --> 01:16:42.792]  My wife went to a private school.
[01:16:42.812 --> 01:16:44.493]  Tuition was a lot more expensive.
[01:16:44.794 --> 01:16:47.395]  She wound up with a small loan, but it was manageable, okay?
[01:16:47.435 --> 01:16:50.257]  We didn't become slaves for our entire life like these kids are.
[01:16:50.277 --> 01:16:52.979]  So they have to ask themselves, why is this so expensive?
[01:16:53.019 --> 01:16:56.281]  And it's because it's been subsidized by the government.
[01:16:56.801 --> 01:17:00.064]  Okay, that's that subsidy just like you see with insurance rates.
[01:17:00.144 --> 01:17:20.383]  Okay, you compare what happens when somebody goes to the hospital and they have insurance versus, and this is the LA Times did this, it's not a conservative paper doing this, they said look at what happens somebody goes to get health care, they don't have any insurance, they're a cash patient, they paid less overall than the people with insurance paid, even with their, you know, paid for their deductible.
[01:17:20.843 --> 01:17:23.504]  So their deductible was more than the cash patient paid total.
[01:17:23.744 --> 01:17:24.124]  Right.
[01:17:24.364 --> 01:17:28.706]  And that's what you're getting at these people being educated socialists.
[01:17:28.726 --> 01:17:30.427]  And they love Bernie Sanders, as you pointed out.
[01:17:30.467 --> 01:17:35.328]  Well, they're not even really educated because we have this clip, the guys are queuing up from Fox News.
[01:17:35.348 --> 01:17:39.750]  There's a young lady named Keely, I guess she was in charge of the Million Stimulus March.
[01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:42.531]  And basically the commentator asked her, well,
[01:17:43.251 --> 01:17:44.353]  Who's going to pay for this stuff?
[01:17:44.693 --> 01:17:46.495]  Well, the 1% is going to pay for it.
[01:17:46.896 --> 01:17:48.959]  Well, if you tax the 1%, they're going to move out of the country.
[01:17:48.999 --> 01:17:49.840]  Then who's going to pay for it?
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.342]  Well, somebody's always going to have money.
[01:17:51.362 --> 01:17:52.844]  There's always going to be a 1%.
[01:17:52.924 --> 01:17:55.788]  As Margaret Thatcher said, eventually you run out of other people's money.
[01:17:55.968 --> 01:17:57.049]  That's the problem with socialism.
[01:17:57.370 --> 01:17:58.972]  So let's go ahead and take a look at this clip.
[01:18:01.246 --> 01:18:02.746]  Okay, we're going to have that in a moment.
[01:18:02.986 --> 01:18:11.489]  Well, you know, when we talk about that, I think, and Bernie Sanders is a part of what is feeding this, because he's really pushing socialism hardcore.
[01:18:11.969 --> 01:18:18.231]  The thing about Bernie Sanders is that he comes across as authentic, as genuine to people, and so that sells.
[01:18:18.451 --> 01:18:22.612]  And I think you could see that in Ron Paul when he ran last time.
[01:18:22.652 --> 01:18:23.392]  People knew that
[01:18:23.912 --> 01:18:26.934]  He would be consistent in what he believed, okay?
[01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:28.614]  So he had a large following of college students.
[01:18:28.935 --> 01:18:32.416]  And they're not really looking at libertarianism versus socialism.
[01:18:32.436 --> 01:18:39.960]  When you go back and you look, I call him Bernie Sandinista because of his praise for the Sandinistas and for Daniel Ortega down in Nicaragua.
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:41.580]  Look at what happened with that.
[01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:44.041]  I mean, that was a classic case of crony capitalism.
[01:18:44.101 --> 01:18:47.342]  He was thrown out by a coalition of conservatives and communists.
[01:18:48.002 --> 01:18:48.302]  Okay?
[01:18:48.502 --> 01:18:56.945]  He had confiscated people's property, confiscated the property of corporations, and then before he left office, he privatized it again into his own personal account.
[01:18:57.305 --> 01:19:06.368]  And look at the basket case that Hugo Chavez's Venezuela and Nicaragua and you know Venezuela they pay the bankers 700% return on their investment.
[01:19:06.388 --> 01:19:16.531]  Bloomberg was bragging about that saying you know people are having to go to other countries to get food and water and medicine but they know that they got to pay the bankers first and we're getting 700% return on investment so it's still a great deal.
[01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:25.954]  That's what Bernie Sanders says he's against is this kind of crony capitalism this Wall Street raping of the people and yet that's precisely where it happens the worst
[01:19:26.514 --> 01:19:28.840]  ...is in the countries that he holds up as examples.
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:32.870]  They have the worst crony capitalism, the worst kleptocracies going on in these countries.
[01:19:33.641 --> 01:19:39.185]  Right, and everyone's always trying to say, oh, Scandinavia, Denmark, and all of these other places, but that's not reality.
[01:19:39.586 --> 01:19:47.191]  And, you know, I don't think a lot of bad news comes out of those places, because they're, you know... Well, they're getting poorer very rapidly now with the open borders.
[01:19:47.231 --> 01:19:58.940]  That's the way you take those countries down, because they started out at a much higher level than these Central American countries, and it's going to take a longer time to take them down, unless, and because, they are now bringing in these open borders.
[01:19:59.701 --> 01:20:00.182]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:00.222 --> 01:20:00.764]  Stay with us.
[01:20:00.924 --> 01:20:03.592]  We're gonna be talking about the media as well.
[01:20:03.612 --> 01:20:04.334]  We'll be right back.

[01:21:14.084 --> 01:21:18.010]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:21:18.250 --> 01:21:20.092]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:24.671]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:24.691 --> 01:24:28.894]  I'm David Knight and joining me in the studio are Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo, Joe Biggs.
[01:24:29.114 --> 01:24:29.414]  Sir.
[01:24:29.454 --> 01:24:34.037]  We've been talking about the massive marches across the country yesterday.
[01:24:34.839 --> 01:24:39.421]  Uh, pushing the idea that kids today ought to get a free college education.
[01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:43.923]  And of course, as you pointed out earlier, uh, we're all out of college.
[01:24:43.963 --> 01:24:47.205]  We're going to be, we had to pay for our college degrees if we got them one way or the other.
[01:24:47.225 --> 01:24:48.506]  We had to pay for somebody else's.
[01:24:48.526 --> 01:24:50.186]  It was incented to go out and do a good job.
[01:24:50.467 --> 01:24:51.587]  I need to pay off those loans.
[01:24:51.807 --> 01:24:53.248]  So, you know, what's, what's fair about that?
[01:24:53.288 --> 01:24:54.288]  But here's the bigger issue.
[01:24:54.328 --> 01:24:55.349]  Of course, we know that
[01:24:56.454 --> 01:25:00.455]  Illegal aliens can come into the country, they can get in-state tuition.
[01:25:01.176 --> 01:25:03.896]  Even better than American students, okay?
[01:25:03.936 --> 01:25:15.540]  And the whole idea behind that is that you paid taxes all your life to partially support this university, but we cannot afford to provide a free college education to everybody on the planet.
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:17.581]  And that's what's going to wind up happening with this.
[01:25:17.961 --> 01:25:22.264]  Anybody who can get their feet into the country will be able to get a free college education.
[01:25:22.564 --> 01:25:25.546]  But let's play that report that you were talking about, Jakari.
[01:25:26.047 --> 01:25:28.389]  They actually asked one of the organizers, is that correct?
[01:25:28.429 --> 01:25:34.253]  Yes, one of the organizers of the Million Student March went on Fox News and the guy asked her basic questions.
[01:25:34.293 --> 01:25:35.073]  Who's going to pay for this?
[01:25:35.133 --> 01:25:37.255]  And she has some rather interesting non-answers.
[01:25:38.336 --> 01:25:39.156]  Yeah, let's run that clip.
[01:25:40.157 --> 01:25:40.717]  What do you want?
[01:25:43.941 --> 01:25:55.211]  Um, well, so the movement, the Million Student March, um, is a movement for a more, um, equitable and fair system of education, as opposed to, um, the really corporate model that we have right now.
[01:25:55.812 --> 01:26:05.981]  Uh, so the three core demands of the National Day of Action are free public college, a cancellation of student debt, and a $15 an hour minimum wage, um, for people who work on the campus.
[01:26:06.301 --> 01:26:07.342]  And how's that gonna be paid?
[01:26:09.958 --> 01:26:11.861]  Um, great question.
[01:26:12.102 --> 01:26:13.725]  I mean, you know, so... I was prepared for this.
[01:26:13.945 --> 01:26:14.426]  Whatever.
[01:26:14.546 --> 01:26:17.250]  I'm not sure if you're talking on, like, a national level or at particular schools.
[01:26:17.290 --> 01:26:18.372]  I can sort of touch on both.
[01:26:19.053 --> 01:26:22.379]  Um, at my university... Well, if you wanted all that stuff, someone has to pick up the tab.
[01:26:22.399 --> 01:26:22.960]  Who would that be?
[01:26:25.838 --> 01:26:33.705]  The 1% of people in society that are hoarding the wealth and really sort of causing a catastrophe that students are facing.
[01:26:33.745 --> 01:26:41.351]  I mean, we have a relationship right now where 1% of the population owns more wealth than the 99% combined.
[01:26:45.435 --> 01:26:48.677]  Just had their taxes raised a few years ago back to almost 40%.
[01:26:49.158 --> 01:26:52.601]  Then to pay for the health care law, they had them raised another few percentage points.
[01:26:53.201 --> 01:26:59.630]  Then they had their deductions limited to raise another couple points where, depending on the state or locality, they're pushing over about 50% of taxes.
[01:26:59.670 --> 01:27:00.832]  How much higher do you think it was?
[01:27:05.185 --> 01:27:09.766]  You know, we all need to remember Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, who didn't go to college.
[01:27:09.786 --> 01:27:12.347]  You know, Bill Gates had a lot of help from his millionaire dad.
[01:27:12.367 --> 01:27:16.768]  But you know, the bottom line is Steve Jobs, a lot of entrepreneurs didn't go to college.
[01:27:16.848 --> 01:27:18.949]  And I love how they start this off.
[01:27:18.969 --> 01:27:20.369]  She's like, our demands.
[01:27:20.989 --> 01:27:22.650]  We want free college tuition.
[01:27:22.690 --> 01:27:25.231]  We want loans forgiven and all this stuff.
[01:27:25.251 --> 01:27:29.632]  And I'm not a fan of corporate welfare because that's oftentimes the counterpoint.
[01:27:29.992 --> 01:27:32.513]  It's like, well, instead of giving corporations welfare, give it to us.
[01:27:32.833 --> 01:27:34.134]  I don't want anybody to get it.
[01:27:34.194 --> 01:27:36.335]  You know, I didn't get to go to UT.
[01:27:36.375 --> 01:27:40.336]  I didn't go to the big school with the big football team and, you know, celebrities drop by every week.
[01:27:40.636 --> 01:27:41.156]  I didn't get that.
[01:27:41.176 --> 01:27:46.338]  I went to a freaking community college, you know, went to small universities, you know, in Backwoods, Kansas and Oklahoma.
[01:27:46.779 --> 01:27:49.860]  And now I don't have, you know, $80,000 in student loan debt.
[01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:50.720]  That's how you do it.
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:57.823]  If you choose to be 18 years old and go and buy, you know, a education, which is the same price of a BMW, then you're just going to be in debt.
[01:27:58.123 --> 01:28:01.426]  Well, you know, if this young lady is an example, she's the leader of this movement.
[01:28:01.786 --> 01:28:04.529]  She's representative of the people who are getting college degrees.
[01:28:04.569 --> 01:28:10.394]  I would say in the near future, a college degree is going to be a counter indicator of whether or not you should be hired.
[01:28:10.955 --> 01:28:11.635]  Right.
[01:28:11.835 --> 01:28:15.639]  I'm very proud of the fact that I'm a high school dropout.
[01:28:15.699 --> 01:28:16.920]  Like, I'm very proud of that.
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:19.482]  You know, they couldn't hold me down.
[01:28:19.762 --> 01:28:22.505]  I went to a private Christian school, then I homeschooled.
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:29.762]  I mean, I learned more in homeschool hanging around, you know, my mom coming in and teaching me stuff the night, whatever, in a public school.
[01:28:29.782 --> 01:28:34.264]  Just like basic stuff, just like Joe was mentioning earlier, if everybody has it, it doesn't mean anything.
[01:28:34.304 --> 01:28:37.125]  If everybody can fly and everybody's bulletproof, there is no Superman.
[01:28:37.265 --> 01:28:37.585]  That's right.
[01:28:37.605 --> 01:28:42.467]  So basically you have a college degree just to get a, uh, just to work at a reception desk.
[01:28:42.930 --> 01:28:46.233]  But you know what will happen is, they will fold this in as a federal thing.
[01:28:46.393 --> 01:28:48.134]  And what they'll do is they'll just paper it.
[01:28:48.454 --> 01:28:49.555]  They'll just start printing paper.
[01:28:49.936 --> 01:28:52.057]  Nobody will pay any attention to the cost.
[01:28:52.137 --> 01:28:55.460]  It'll accelerate the collapse of the country.
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:57.782]  It is sort of the pressure from above and below.
[01:28:57.902 --> 01:29:03.446]  And so now you're creating this class of people that is demanding this welfare, demanding this socialism.
[01:29:03.967 --> 01:29:05.928]  And it's going to look like the Hunger Games.
[01:29:06.028 --> 01:29:07.890]  Our society will look like the Hunger Games.
[01:29:07.930 --> 01:29:16.073]  Well, what's going to happen, and there's already moves that are happening, to change the United States, the American dollar from being the reserve currency, to get rid of the petrodollar.
[01:29:16.093 --> 01:29:17.614]  China very much wants to get rid of it.
[01:29:17.654 --> 01:29:28.479]  We're making enemies of Russia, the Cold War, we're starting up again, so they want to get us out of that, because that's the source of our power, to create this massive military, to do all these things for which we never have any economic accountability.
[01:29:29.119 --> 01:29:36.122]  And when that plug is pulled, and people point out that we've been walking on air, we're going to sink like a cartoon character.
[01:29:36.283 --> 01:29:39.324]  We're going to look down at some point and go, oh, there's nothing underneath me.
[01:29:39.444 --> 01:29:42.946]  This has been a fantasy of my imagination, and that's it.
[01:29:43.486 --> 01:29:44.326]  And that's what's going to happen.
[01:29:44.347 --> 01:29:45.067]  Look, when we come back,
[01:29:45.427 --> 01:29:47.269]  We're going to talk about the media.
[01:29:47.649 --> 01:29:50.812]  We're going to play for you this back and forth about killing Reagan.
[01:29:50.892 --> 01:29:58.820]  It's going to be very entertaining, and we'll talk about the real issues that are brought up as well as the back and forth between Bill O'Reilly and George.
[01:29:58.860 --> 01:29:59.441]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:59.461 --> 01:30:00.021]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.522 --> 01:30:02.123]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:05.747]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:11.347 --> 01:30:16.029]  New report expects a million cancer deaths from Fukushima fallout.
[01:30:16.609 --> 01:30:19.191]  Underestimated and under-reported.
[01:30:19.631 --> 01:30:23.032]  Article up at InfoWars.com by Christian Seric.
[01:30:23.753 --> 01:30:28.695]  In a new report published by Fair Wind Energy Education, or FEE,
[01:30:29.275 --> 01:30:32.639]  Cancer is on the rise in post-Fukushima Japan.
[01:30:32.879 --> 01:30:46.313]  We learned that the ongoing multi-core nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima plant has produced approximately 230 times higher than normal thyroid cancers in Fukushima Prefecture.
[01:30:46.713 --> 01:30:53.938]  And could result in as many as one million more cancers due to the incident that happened in March of 2011.
[01:30:55.039 --> 01:31:02.784]  Five years later and we are still getting a grip on how catastrophic Fukushima truly was to this planet and its people.
[01:31:03.345 --> 01:31:06.667]  You can read more about this at InfoWars.com.
[01:31:06.887 --> 01:31:07.568]  I'm Joe Biggs.

[01:33:03.372 --> 01:33:05.073]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:05.113 --> 01:33:07.535]  Just a good old boy, never meanin' no harm.
[01:33:23.126 --> 01:33:31.070]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight and joining me are Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo and Joe Biggs.
[01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:42.795]  We're going to talk about this back and forth between George Will and Bill O'Reilly over Bill O'Reilly's recent book, the one that's at the top of the non-fiction charts, Killing Reagan.
[01:33:43.475 --> 01:33:49.218]  I think it brings up, so it's very entertaining to watch it actually, but it also brings up some very interesting points about
[01:33:49.998 --> 01:33:51.458]  How we do journalism.
[01:33:51.538 --> 01:33:53.539]  How do we determine what's true and what isn't?
[01:33:53.579 --> 01:33:58.721]  And of course there was also an article earlier this week about daily newspapers down 80 percent.
[01:33:58.801 --> 01:34:01.321]  Hard news is in danger of disappearing, they say.
[01:34:01.341 --> 01:34:05.362]  It's the same kind of extinction it's facing as newspapers and magazines.
[01:34:05.403 --> 01:34:09.564]  So they're very concerned that people are not interested in watching quote-unquote hard news.
[01:34:09.584 --> 01:34:14.785]  So we're going to talk about what is hard news as opposed to what they term opinion journalism.
[01:34:15.205 --> 01:34:16.766]  It's a very important discussion to have.
[01:34:17.566 --> 01:34:20.869]  Shows up in things like the back and forth that we saw about Ben Carson.
[01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:24.672]  Were the vettings that they did of Ben Carson, was that over the top?
[01:34:25.133 --> 01:34:26.474]  Or was that fair game?
[01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:28.035]  So we can talk about that sort of thing as well.
[01:34:28.055 --> 01:34:36.302]  Before we do, before we go to our panelists, before we play this clip with comments about what happened with killing Reagan, I want to let you know about a couple of specials.
[01:34:37.543 --> 01:34:39.845]  Actually one special and a new product that we've got.

[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:03.621]  Also, a new product.

[01:35:24.226 --> 01:35:25.286]  Good time to stock up.
[01:35:28.227 --> 01:35:36.834]  Before winter sets in and you start to feel the effects of not getting your vitamin D3 from being in the sun so much.
[01:35:36.974 --> 01:35:38.556]  Good time to stock up on that while it's in stock.
[01:35:39.496 --> 01:35:40.237]  Let's play this.
[01:35:40.517 --> 01:35:42.259]  Let me set this up a little bit for people who don't know.
[01:35:43.283 --> 01:35:46.166]  Of course, Bill O'Reilly wrote a book called Killing Reagan.
[01:35:46.206 --> 01:35:59.897]  The central premise of the book was that the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan about 70 days into his presidency left him mentally impaired with an early onset of Alzheimer's.
[01:36:00.638 --> 01:36:12.947]  Now, George Will took immense exception to that and wrote an editorial on the Washington Post saying that, look, conservatism essentially hangs on whether or not Reagan was a great guy or not.
[01:36:13.187 --> 01:36:17.310]  He wants to see hagiographies and nothing but hagiographies for Ronald Reagan.
[01:36:17.591 --> 01:36:19.652]  We've got to make a saint out of him.
[01:36:20.313 --> 01:36:25.176]  And he believes that conservatism hangs on whether or not Ronald Reagan is a perfect guy.
[01:36:25.396 --> 01:36:27.118]  I mean, that's basically it, folks.
[01:36:27.498 --> 01:36:28.318]  And so he wrote a
[01:36:29.159 --> 01:36:30.360]  Nevertheless, he had some good points.
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:42.147]  He made some really strong points about sloppy research, about not checking and vetting sources in his book, and that was what really got under Bill O'Reilly's skin.
[01:36:42.667 --> 01:36:52.994]  He pointed out that Bill O'Reilly had not checked any sources, he had not, they listed as a reference, and he didn't have a lot of references in his book for what he was talking about.
[01:36:53.334 --> 01:37:03.676]  He listed it as one of the references to the Reagan Library, and you have to sign in to get materials out of the Reagan Library, and he was able to check that Bill O'Reilly nor his assistants went there to get any information.
[01:37:04.317 --> 01:37:18.180]  So Bill O'Reilly, that same day, it was such a glaring attack on him, George Will said that Bill O'Reilly had done more damage to Ronald Reagan and to conservatism, because conservatism equals Ronald Reagan in their minds.
[01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:24.966]  He had done more damage than a conscientious historian could have done who was opposed to Ronald Reagan.
[01:37:25.246 --> 01:37:28.469]  I mean, it was just that kind of, you know, stick the knife in and twist it.
[01:37:28.529 --> 01:37:30.871]  You know, he did more damage than a real historian could have done.
[01:37:31.152 --> 01:37:35.416]  So, Bill O'Reilly has him on the program and I want you to see this and we'll comment on this.
[01:37:35.916 --> 01:37:36.697]  Let's roll that clip.
[01:37:37.964 --> 01:37:39.746]  The memo was presented to Howard Baker.
[01:37:39.806 --> 01:37:44.352]  Howard Baker took one look at it and said to the man who wrote it, this is not the Ronald Reagan I know.
[01:37:44.392 --> 01:37:45.233]  And that was the end.
[01:37:45.273 --> 01:37:46.434]  That was not the end of it.
[01:37:46.454 --> 01:37:47.916]  You're not telling the truth.
[01:37:48.336 --> 01:37:50.779]  You are actively misleading the American people.
[01:37:51.099 --> 01:37:51.560]  You are lying.
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:53.763]  You're something of an expert on active misleading.
[01:37:53.863 --> 01:37:54.684]  Stop that right there.
[01:37:54.704 --> 01:37:55.304]  Stop that right there.
[01:37:56.486 --> 01:37:59.029]  He goes, you are actively misleading the American people.
[01:38:00.050 --> 01:38:05.476]  And then George Will returns and says to Bill Raleigh, you are something of an expert on misleading the American people.
[01:38:05.496 --> 01:38:06.797]  He's learning from the best right there.
[01:38:06.817 --> 01:38:08.579]  These guys both work for Fox.
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:10.021]  I thought the spin stopped there.
[01:38:11.232 --> 01:38:17.996]  Well, they began the interview and he comes after George Will for not going to, and we're going to talk about hard news.
[01:38:18.256 --> 01:38:21.958]  You didn't go to the editor of Hard News like you were told to do.
[01:38:22.218 --> 01:38:25.280]  You were supposed to show this to him before you went public with this.
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:26.340]  Weren't you told this?
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:28.061]  And they go back and forth.
[01:38:29.382 --> 01:38:31.803]  He was not defending his book.
[01:38:31.843 --> 01:38:35.565]  He was attacking him for not getting it approved from Fox because they both work for Fox.
[01:38:35.845 --> 01:38:37.146]  Let's continue on with that clip.
[01:38:37.726 --> 01:38:39.327]  ...the American people, you are lying.
[01:38:39.347 --> 01:38:41.589]  You're something of an expert on actively misleading people.
[01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:42.689]  You are lying.
[01:38:42.829 --> 01:38:43.810]  And here's more proof.
[01:38:43.970 --> 01:38:45.311]  Edwin Morris, you know who he is?
[01:38:46.492 --> 01:38:47.512]  You know who Edwin Morris is?
[01:38:47.552 --> 01:38:47.973]  Go ahead.
[01:38:48.133 --> 01:38:48.453]  Okay.
[01:38:49.053 --> 01:38:49.854]  Okay, here it is.
[01:38:50.654 --> 01:39:05.724]  Edwin Morris, quote, during one unhappy period, when the Iran-Contra scandal coincided with prostate problems for Mr. Reagan, the president was so withdrawn and confused that papers were surreptitiously drawn up by staffers concerned he might have to be declared disoriented.
[01:39:06.471 --> 01:39:06.752]  Okay?
[01:39:07.092 --> 01:39:09.996]  Now that is from the guy who wrote the bio.
[01:39:10.557 --> 01:39:11.538]  You want LA Times?
[01:39:11.558 --> 01:39:13.101]  You want New York Times quotes on it?
[01:39:13.601 --> 01:39:14.022]  I got them.
[01:39:14.242 --> 01:39:14.963]  I can read them to you.
[01:39:15.856 --> 01:39:27.799]  You who began this interview by saying, I had a moral obligation to call you by for writing about your book, wrote a book without feeling any obligation to talk to Ed Meese, George Shultz, Jim Baker, any of the other people.
[01:39:27.819 --> 01:39:28.239]  Hold it right there.
[01:39:28.399 --> 01:39:28.879]  Hold it right there.
[01:39:29.099 --> 01:39:37.541]  So he says, you began the interview by saying, I should have talked to you first before I went out of this, but he goes, you wrote a book about Reagan without talking to anybody that was close to him, right?
[01:39:37.581 --> 01:39:37.921]  Yeah.
[01:39:37.941 --> 01:39:38.582]  That's a great guy.
[01:39:38.762 --> 01:39:39.762]  Let's continue on with this.
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:43.383]  And why did I not talk to them?
[01:39:43.704 --> 01:39:44.365]  No.
[01:39:44.925 --> 01:39:49.491]  Because they have skin in the game.
[01:39:49.551 --> 01:39:52.434]  We don't talk to people when we're writing our books.
[01:39:52.554 --> 01:39:54.277]  You mean they have knowledge of the game?
[01:39:54.297 --> 01:39:57.761]  They have skin in the game, emotion in the game, skin in the game.
[01:39:58.061 --> 01:40:02.123]  Now, I thought it was interesting when I saw this because George Will missed that opportunity.
[01:40:02.323 --> 01:40:04.924]  He didn't come back and say, well then why would I talk to you?
[01:40:05.064 --> 01:40:06.465]  Because you've got skin in the game.
[01:40:06.745 --> 01:40:06.885]  Yeah.
[01:40:06.905 --> 01:40:08.486]  I mean, why would I talk to you about your own book?
[01:40:08.506 --> 01:40:09.686]  You're not going to come in on this.
[01:40:09.986 --> 01:40:15.189]  And so Bill O'Reilly goes on with the idea that we don't talk to people who are laudatory sources or whatever.
[01:40:15.689 --> 01:40:19.254]  And so that brings up the whole issue as to, you know, who do you talk to?
[01:40:19.314 --> 01:40:20.295]  What is hard news?
[01:40:20.315 --> 01:40:25.902]  But let's finish up with this because the kicker here, the way this ends, is really pretty amazing.
[01:40:25.963 --> 01:40:29.347]  I mean, Bill O'Reilly really loses it with George Will.
[01:40:29.367 --> 01:40:29.868]  Let's play this.
[01:40:30.595 --> 01:40:35.939]  We don't talk to anybody who is derogatory to the Reagans or anybody who is laudatory.
[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:37.721]  We do our own investigation.
[01:40:38.021 --> 01:40:39.042]  You want me to read more?
[01:40:39.402 --> 01:40:40.023]  I got more.
[01:40:40.603 --> 01:40:43.045]  This meeting absolutely took place on page 245.
[01:40:44.066 --> 01:40:47.509]  It was absolutely taken seriously by Mr. Baker and everybody else.
[01:40:48.089 --> 01:40:51.852]  And the conclusion of the meeting was the president was fine.
[01:40:52.232 --> 01:40:53.073]  He was capable.
[01:40:53.513 --> 01:40:57.116]  And Killing Reagan is a laudatory book toward Ronald Reagan.
[01:40:57.297 --> 01:40:58.758]  And you didn't even mention that.
[01:40:59.797 --> 01:41:01.118]  It is not a laudatory book.
[01:41:01.218 --> 01:41:04.039]  It is a laudatory book, or you can't read.
[01:41:04.619 --> 01:41:12.102]  It is doing the work of the left, which knows that in order to discredit conservatism, it must destroy Reagan's reputation as a president.
[01:41:12.162 --> 01:41:16.544]  And your book does the work of the American left with its extreme recklessness.
[01:41:16.604 --> 01:41:24.687]  And when you finally got around, after the book's publication, to scheduling an interview with Ed Meese, you then cancelled it, saying you were vetting the memo.
[01:41:24.707 --> 01:41:27.968]  We cancelled it because Ed Meese wanted to come on with conditions.
[01:41:28.528 --> 01:41:34.075]  It's a memo you haven't even seen, so I do not understand how you've got a memo you've never seen.
[01:41:34.095 --> 01:41:35.977]  Alright, look, here's the deal.
[01:41:36.158 --> 01:41:37.179]  That memo was written.
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:38.961]  That meeting took place.
[01:41:39.462 --> 01:41:41.544]  All of what we write in Killing Reagan is true.
[01:41:42.025 --> 01:41:42.806]  You're a hack.
[01:41:43.306 --> 01:41:47.947]  You're in with the cabal of the Reagan loyalists who don't want the truth to be told.
[01:41:48.388 --> 01:41:50.288]  Killing Reagan is a laudatory book.
[01:41:50.908 --> 01:41:52.429]  It praises Ronald Reagan.
[01:41:52.649 --> 01:41:56.110]  Yet you didn't call me when you said you would.
[01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:57.290]  That's a fact.
[01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:59.871]  Why did Reagan loyalists not want this laudatory book?
[01:41:59.891 --> 01:42:01.792]  Because they wanted a deification.
[01:42:02.112 --> 01:42:03.452]  They wanted a deification.
[01:42:03.672 --> 01:42:05.973]  They tried to get the book killed before it was even published.
[01:42:06.333 --> 01:42:07.033]  And you!
[01:42:07.053 --> 01:42:07.693]  That is a lie.
[01:42:10.554 --> 01:42:14.596]  That isn't a lie, and we can prove it, and you are a hack.
[01:42:15.317 --> 01:42:15.837]  Do so.
[01:42:16.097 --> 01:42:16.677]  Do so, Mr. O'Reilly.
[01:42:16.737 --> 01:42:19.018]  Look, he's like, I want the laugh.
[01:42:19.079 --> 01:42:21.720]  Now, you guys can correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:29.664]  Didn't O'Reilly say he visited some witness of the JFK assassination when he was working in Dallas, and then they proved that he never went there?
[01:42:29.684 --> 01:42:31.064]  It's like some guy who lived in Florida.
[01:42:31.525 --> 01:42:33.666]  I don't remember, I don't remember, but I thought it was interesting.
[01:42:34.326 --> 01:42:38.768]  Saying that, you know, well, you know, conservatism rises or falls on Ronald Reagan.
[01:42:38.908 --> 01:42:41.009]  And it's like, well, if that's the case, it's going to fall.
[01:42:41.489 --> 01:42:43.650]  Because you, you know, people are fallible.
[01:42:44.071 --> 01:42:44.331]  Okay?
[01:42:44.411 --> 01:42:46.312]  And Ronald Reagan had a lot of issues.
[01:42:46.352 --> 01:42:52.955]  I think the real core with all this is that people who around the time, you know, we looked at Ronald Reagan and it was like, wow.
[01:42:53.775 --> 01:42:55.076]  You know, what happened to him?
[01:42:55.196 --> 01:42:59.880]  You know, people said, well, you know, did he have an early onset of Alzheimer's?
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:00.941]  Did they get to him?
[01:43:01.001 --> 01:43:01.922]  Did they threaten him?
[01:43:01.982 --> 01:43:02.922]  Did he sell out?
[01:43:03.303 --> 01:43:05.445]  Was he a phony from the very beginning?
[01:43:05.605 --> 01:43:09.808]  You know, I mean, because everything that he said he was going to do, and that's a lesson for people.
[01:43:10.308 --> 01:43:12.350]  He said he was going to get rid of the Department of Education.
[01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:13.751]  He's going to balance the budget.
[01:43:13.811 --> 01:43:19.436]  And so he had a long list of promises, all of which he basically just threw under the table, you know, when he got in there.
[01:43:19.776 --> 01:43:22.018]  And we saw things like Iran-Contra, okay?
[01:43:22.219 --> 01:43:24.181]  I mean, that's a big deal, okay?
[01:43:24.581 --> 01:43:27.024]  And subsequently, we have seen people...
[01:43:28.590 --> 01:43:56.471]  alleged and that he was uh... that they were in negotiation with the iranian government telling them do not release the hostages to jimmy carter hold them until after the election if you do that we will make a deal with you okay which is what they did they sold that supposedly our worst enemy okay the center of terrorism that everybody was told they were selling them spare parts because of course they had a whole bunch of american uh... fighter planes there that they'd given to the shah so they were selling them spare parts and then using that to conduct
[01:43:57.371 --> 01:44:03.237]  Uh, uh, guerrilla warfare in violation of the law, in violation of the Constitution, okay?
[01:44:03.297 --> 01:44:05.419]  So, you gotta hold their feet to the fire.
[01:44:05.459 --> 01:44:14.928]  It's like this documentary you saw, Killing Ed, where, uh, he's talking to Dan Patrick here in, in Texas, who likes charter schools for whatever reason.
[01:44:14.968 --> 01:44:19.273]  I mean, I, I want to have a choice as a parent, but if you can't
[01:44:19.773 --> 01:44:26.480]  Pull back and say, yeah, you know what, I've seen some abuses with charter schools like these Gulen schools, so maybe we need to fix them because they're not perfect.
[01:44:26.961 --> 01:44:28.963]  But what Dan Patrick does is he doubles down.
[01:44:29.323 --> 01:44:31.906]  He won't admit that there's a problem with these Gulen schools.
[01:44:32.266 --> 01:44:34.729]  And so, you know, he discredits the whole thing.
[01:44:34.769 --> 01:44:38.933]  That's what really discredits conservatism, is when you won't admit where it failed.
[01:44:39.093 --> 01:44:54.166]  Yeah, I agree with that 100%, and I'm not defending O'Reilly here at all, but for somebody, as O'Reilly put it, to deify these people, that's the issue that led us to the part where we are in this country today, because you can't criticize Obama, you can't criticize Reagan, you can't criticize Bush.
[01:44:54.827 --> 01:45:04.535]  Everybody has their superheroes in politics that you cannot dare say that the emperor has no clothes, and that's pretty much what has led us to this situation in American history.
[01:45:05.396 --> 01:45:06.096]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:45:06.377 --> 01:45:14.381]  So we come to this report here, and this says Media Graveyard, as we've read the headlines many times, and they say that we're going to lose, quote-unquote, hard news.
[01:45:14.461 --> 01:45:16.402]  It's going to go the way of the newspaper and the magazine.
[01:45:16.823 --> 01:45:23.306]  And we're going to have a rise of a type of opinion journalism that was popular two or three centuries ago.
[01:45:23.346 --> 01:45:32.852]  Well, I would say that, you know, maybe that's not a bad thing, because two or three centuries ago we had the people who were educated enough in this country to lay down the principles that we have foolishly abandoned
[01:45:33.372 --> 01:45:35.014]  Okay, that would make this country work.
[01:45:35.875 --> 01:45:40.780]  But I guess when I look at this, I think that what's dying is really this myth of objective journalism.
[01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:41.140]  Right.
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:49.308]  Yeah, I mean, you can see how biased the media actually is just with the debate coverage and the questions that are asked at each debate.
[01:45:50.769 --> 01:45:57.314]  Well, what they talk about opinion journalism, I mean, opinion journalism is going to be absolutely worthless if you can't back it up with facts, right?
[01:45:57.734 --> 01:46:08.923]  But when we talk about, quote-unquote, objective journalism, okay, that is, quote-unquote, hard news, right, what they're saying here is that they don't have a point of view that's coming through in their news.
[01:46:09.123 --> 01:46:09.743]  Of course they do!
[01:46:10.084 --> 01:46:11.925]  What, the stories that you choose to pick,
[01:46:12.065 --> 01:46:12.265]  Yes.
[01:46:12.285 --> 01:46:13.126]  Show your point of view.
[01:46:13.146 --> 01:46:14.607]  Look at the Drudge Report, for example.
[01:46:14.888 --> 01:46:16.069]  He's an editor, okay?
[01:46:16.109 --> 01:46:17.070]  He's America's editor.
[01:46:17.090 --> 01:46:20.513]  He decides what is interesting to him, okay?
[01:46:20.893 --> 01:46:30.522]  And that's the same process that happens in all the newspapers, at the Washington Post, the New York Times, the LA Times, all these people who are supposedly totally objective and unbiased.
[01:46:30.942 --> 01:46:34.425]  Their biases show up in the articles that they choose to report.
[01:46:34.446 --> 01:46:35.807]  Look where the money is coming from.
[01:46:36.247 --> 01:46:45.334]  Or the sources that they get in touch with, and it's always administration officials say, you know, sources at the White House say, like, oh, okay.
[01:46:45.614 --> 01:46:47.335]  Fox News is far from fair and balanced.
[01:46:47.776 --> 01:46:48.056]  Oh, yeah.
[01:46:48.096 --> 01:46:48.516]  In any way.
[01:46:48.796 --> 01:46:49.177]  Absolutely.
[01:46:49.197 --> 01:46:52.619]  And CNN should just come out and say, you know what, we're here for the Democrats completely and totally.
[01:46:52.819 --> 01:46:53.320]  Right.
[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:55.801]  You know, MSNBC, hey, we're liberal as hell, that's what we're doing.
[01:46:55.821 --> 01:47:00.205]  You know, but that's the thing, though, and every time I go out and talk to people, like, hey, what do you guys watch for news, what do you look to?
[01:47:00.845 --> 01:47:08.893]  Like, we don't really trust going to any kind of news source because they always lie and say that they're either fair and balanced or they're there to give a, you know,
[01:47:10.114 --> 01:47:10.754]  Honest opinion.
[01:47:10.774 --> 01:47:14.976]  Yeah, an honest opinion on every subject, when in fact they know that's not going to happen when you actually sit there.
[01:47:15.316 --> 01:47:19.939]  And then, I always kind of knew that, but I really didn't get to see it until we were going to Ferguson all the time.
[01:47:20.399 --> 01:47:23.961]  And you see how these guys on the ground are reporting what I just saw.
[01:47:24.081 --> 01:47:30.283]  I know I just saw what I saw, but they distorted it within two seconds saying that no smoke was fired, no tear gas.
[01:47:30.304 --> 01:47:32.384]  Police say that the police wasn't shot.
[01:47:32.445 --> 01:47:35.246]  Even they were out there with us, hacking and gagging.
[01:47:35.626 --> 01:47:40.271]  And people wonder why there's a media graveyard, why they don't trust hard news.
[01:47:40.591 --> 01:47:41.812]  Well, I saw it at the Bunny Ranch.
[01:47:41.852 --> 01:47:48.018]  I saw what Glenn Beck did, okay, in terms of the way that he twisted what had happened out there, the way he spun that.
[01:47:48.379 --> 01:47:54.865]  So yeah, we've seen that, and what they're saying in this is that the internet makes it possible for everybody to express their opinion widely.
[01:47:54.885 --> 01:47:57.488]  Well, it also gives us a chance to get first-hand reports.
[01:47:57.748 --> 01:47:58.049]  Yes.
[01:47:58.089 --> 01:47:59.851]  And that's why that is valuable.
[01:47:59.871 --> 01:48:13.230]  You know, in many cases, just like we had with this shooting that's going on, that happened in Idaho, where the rancher went out to put down the bull and we got one official story, but now other stories are coming out there and now we see the government is pushing back.
[01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:14.771]  They're clamping down.
[01:48:14.811 --> 01:48:17.253]  They won't even release the names of the deputies.
[01:48:17.573 --> 01:48:23.197]  They say, well, we don't know whether or not there's any footage captured by their body cameras or by the cars or anything.
[01:48:23.418 --> 01:48:29.402]  When they pull back and they try to shut stuff down like that, that's why people are using the internet to find that information.
[01:48:29.422 --> 01:48:33.045]  Yeah, because you can find all kinds of things on LiveLeak and YouTube and every other thing.
[01:48:33.065 --> 01:48:34.106]  And it doesn't have a chance to be edited.
[01:48:34.346 --> 01:48:36.307]  It's happening at the moment on Twitter.
[01:48:36.628 --> 01:48:43.852]  But you can also see just the way that they're covering all these protests that are going on across the country with Black Lives Matter and everything.
[01:48:44.713 --> 01:48:51.938]  I was watching, I think, CNN the other day, and they were allowing the students to tell their demands right there on primetime news.
[01:48:52.018 --> 01:48:53.579]  Gave them like five minutes.
[01:48:53.979 --> 01:48:55.701]  To just speak, to just talk.
[01:48:56.142 --> 01:48:57.924]  You know, talk about fair and balanced.
[01:48:58.224 --> 01:49:01.488]  And then that ties into this article coming out of Politico.
[01:49:01.949 --> 01:49:04.672]  Major donors consider funding Black Lives Matter.
[01:49:05.052 --> 01:49:13.082]  And so these are major Democratic donors, billionaires, millionaires, who are talking about funding this Black Lives Matter movement.
[01:49:13.883 --> 01:49:14.583]  What do they get out of that?
[01:49:14.603 --> 01:49:15.104]  Meeting in secret.
[01:49:15.364 --> 01:49:16.564]  Right, meeting in secret.
[01:49:16.664 --> 01:49:19.186]  And so what does that mean when you're funding this movement now?
[01:49:19.246 --> 01:49:24.068]  Now do they need to go and protest at the areas that you instruct them to?
[01:49:24.088 --> 01:49:32.913]  But these millionaires and billionaires are meeting in secret and their whole purpose is for a permanent realignment of American politics.
[01:49:33.153 --> 01:49:33.313]  Yeah.
[01:49:33.593 --> 01:49:48.369]  And this whole movement started on Twitter and things like that in the moment, people being there, and then it quickly got co-opted and now there is an agenda, a clear agenda.
[01:49:48.729 --> 01:50:02.319]  So, on the Internet, people are able to freely express opinions, and one of the things that they say in this article is say, well, that's led to people being confused, you know, because they don't have neutral intermediaries like reporters, fact-checkers, editors, readers.
[01:50:02.639 --> 01:50:06.542]  Now they have, they don't really know if what they're getting is true, and it's like, yeah, you have to think.
[01:50:08.180 --> 01:50:13.628]  That's one of the reasons why we had a vibrant political discussion 200 years ago, because people had to think.
[01:50:14.088 --> 01:50:15.250]  People would be upfront about it.
[01:50:15.450 --> 01:50:21.879]  I would prefer somebody is to tell me that they're fair and balanced, and I know that they're either lying to me or they're incredibly naive if they think that.
[01:50:22.299 --> 01:50:24.760]  Okay, they don't understand or recognize their own biases.
[01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:32.022]  I would rather them say, look, I'm a conservative journal, I'm a liberal journal, I'm a libertarian or a socialist journal or whatever.
[01:50:32.862 --> 01:50:36.923]  Be upfront about it and say, here are the facts that I've found and here's how I analyze it.
[01:50:36.943 --> 01:50:39.344]  They say, we're in a golden age of opinion journalism.
[01:50:39.384 --> 01:50:43.705]  There's greater analysis, a sort of more interesting analytical gray zone.
[01:50:43.965 --> 01:50:45.247]  I don't see that as a gray zone.
[01:50:45.327 --> 01:50:46.648]  I see that as a plus.
[01:50:47.069 --> 01:50:52.155]  You know, we're going to analyze these facts from multiple perspectives and try to figure out what's really true.
[01:50:52.175 --> 01:51:00.906]  And just like you said, I'd prefer that they just come out and say, this is my position and this is how I got to this way of thinking, as opposed to trying to convince you that they're neutral, just like... Exactly.
[01:51:00.966 --> 01:51:01.887]  So the reader can understand the slant.
[01:51:03.689 --> 01:51:05.811]  That's exactly what we're missing in the presidential debates.
[01:51:05.911 --> 01:51:06.972]  There is no debate.
[01:51:07.432 --> 01:51:09.153]  We'll be right back with our news crew.
[01:51:09.454 --> 01:51:09.834]  Stay with us.

[01:54:28.684 --> 01:54:30.025]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:30.065 --> 01:54:34.826]  I'm David Knight, and joining me are the news crew, Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo, and Joe Bigg.
[01:54:34.986 --> 01:54:38.327]  We've been talking about this hard news disappearing.
[01:54:39.248 --> 01:54:44.189]  And if you define hard news as this faux objectivity, I think it's a good thing.
[01:54:44.209 --> 01:54:47.871]  I think people need to understand that everyone has biases.
[01:54:48.531 --> 01:54:51.952]  And we're up front about the fact that we're biased for liberty.
[01:54:52.192 --> 01:54:53.393]  We're biased for freedom.
[01:54:53.833 --> 01:54:57.474]  We look at things, we analyze it from that standpoint, and we
[01:54:58.134 --> 01:55:02.038]  Show the facts that we've got and we try to put those together into an analysis.
[01:55:02.098 --> 01:55:02.899]  That's what we do here.
[01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:11.348]  They call that opinion journalism and they're wringing their hands saying that's that's getting more and more popular and So-called hard news is disappearing.
[01:55:11.368 --> 01:55:15.132]  Well, I don't think that's a problem quite frankly I want to go back and and talk to them about how
[01:55:15.712 --> 01:55:19.795]  They view this vetting, I would say the vetting of Ben Carson.
[01:55:19.835 --> 01:55:21.857]  Has it been fair or has it been unfair?
[01:55:22.197 --> 01:55:26.541]  Before I do, real quickly, I want to let you know about a new special we have as well as a new product.
[01:55:26.561 --> 01:55:31.885]  We got Winter Sun Vitamin D3 now 20% off just through the end of this weekend.
[01:55:32.265 --> 01:55:35.966]  We also have a new product that we introduced this week, Living Defense.
[01:55:36.486 --> 01:55:39.286]  Nine out of ten people are infested with harmful organisms.
[01:55:39.506 --> 01:55:46.048]  Living Defense uses wild-crafted and organic herbs to help naturally cleanse harmful organisms out of the body.
[01:55:46.088 --> 01:55:48.008]  We're expected to sell out of this this week.
[01:55:48.088 --> 01:55:50.028]  This is our limited first edition run.
[01:55:50.048 --> 01:55:52.749]  You can find it at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:55:52.769 --> 01:55:53.649]  Right now, what's available?
[01:55:53.689 --> 01:55:55.710]  Again, Living Defense and Vitamin D3.
[01:55:58.030 --> 01:56:06.638]  Winter Sun, those are both available and Winter Sun is 20% off and of course we have other products that are now in stock like Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine.
[01:56:06.979 --> 01:56:10.822]  You need to have that stocked up as we're coming into the winter here.
[01:56:11.583 --> 01:56:20.411]  Let's go to Ben Carson and of course he believes that he was very unfairly treated as people were vetting him for
[01:56:21.767 --> 01:56:23.588]  Uh, claims that were made in his book.
[01:56:24.348 --> 01:56:37.914]  I looked at this, and to me, I believe that they were looking at him very closely, and we can talk about whether or not you agree with what people said about that, but nevertheless, the liberal press, and you understand that there is no objective press, right?
[01:56:37.954 --> 01:56:39.895]  So the liberal press is looking at him very carefully.
[01:56:39.915 --> 01:56:42.336]  The conservative press looked at Obama very carefully.
[01:56:43.036 --> 01:56:49.719]  And the thing that I thought was a problem was not that they were being vetted carefully by people who don't share their opinions and don't support them.
[01:56:50.359 --> 01:56:59.067]  But I see it as a bigger problem that the people who do support them are supporting them personally, and they don't want to hear anything bad about it.
[01:56:59.147 --> 01:57:02.090]  Which takes us back to where we started with George Will about Ronald Reagan.
[01:57:02.770 --> 01:57:10.797]  Oh yes, just like you said, whether it's Republicans, Democrats, whether it's Hillary or Trump, you know, they're looking very hard into anybody who's running.
[01:57:10.817 --> 01:57:14.341]  So to say that they're singling out one guy I think is not
[01:57:15.083 --> 01:57:15.704]  Really accurate.
[01:57:31.986 --> 01:57:36.448]  But, you know, when he was first running, he was out there just, you know, as a personality.
[01:57:36.608 --> 01:57:36.988]  Vote for me.
[01:57:37.008 --> 01:57:38.049]  He's not a celebrity.
[01:57:38.169 --> 01:57:38.589]  Exactly.
[01:57:38.689 --> 01:57:39.509]  I'm a celebrity.
[01:57:39.949 --> 01:57:40.670]  I'm successful.
[01:57:40.730 --> 01:57:41.210]  Vote for me.
[01:57:41.330 --> 01:57:44.551]  And that kind of identity politics, you know, we see that from Carly Fiorina.
[01:57:44.591 --> 01:57:45.092]  I'm a woman.
[01:57:45.152 --> 01:57:45.972]  Vote for me, okay?
[01:57:46.772 --> 01:57:47.993]  I really hate that.
[01:57:48.213 --> 01:57:55.576]  I really hate the fact that people are so invested in a person that they won't look at their background or look at their issues.
[01:57:55.856 --> 01:58:02.180]  You know, and of course with Ben Carson, he's running on his personal integrity, saying that he is an outsider and I'm a person of integrity.
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:09.606]  So it's a valid thing to go in and vet the stories that he's put in print, that he had these things written in his autobiography, I think.
[01:58:09.666 --> 01:58:12.808]  And it scares me when I see the public saying, we don't want to hear that.
[01:58:13.208 --> 01:58:13.768]  That's not fair.
[01:58:13.869 --> 01:58:14.609]  You shouldn't talk about that.
[01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:15.210]  You shouldn't look at that.
[01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:18.632]  I've been critical of almost every candidate out there in some kind of way.
[01:58:18.652 --> 01:58:22.135]  And it's funny, like, I'll get on Facebook and I'll be like, you know, I don't like this about Trump.
[01:58:22.455 --> 01:58:25.177]  And people are like, oh my God, why did you say that about him?
[01:58:25.677 --> 01:58:28.800]  Are you a Clinton supporter then?
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:29.920]  You're a Democrat.
[01:58:30.221 --> 01:58:30.641]  I knew it.
[01:58:31.041 --> 01:58:31.962]  You know what I'm like?
[01:58:32.302 --> 01:58:33.363]  Well, he's not perfect.
[01:58:33.423 --> 01:58:34.945]  He's got some things wrong with him.
[01:58:35.005 --> 01:58:37.287]  I'm just bringing that out so you guys can be a little bit more informed.
[01:58:37.687 --> 01:58:47.936]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back and we're going to talk about that with our news crew, exactly what came back, and we're going to see what they thought about the Ben Carson betting, whether that was fair or not, and what they thought about came out of it.
[01:58:47.956 --> 01:58:48.537]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:56.344]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[02:00:27.946 --> 02:00:31.987]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.754 --> 02:00:36.954]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:36.975 --> 02:00:40.556]  I'm David Knight and Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo and Joe Biggs are here with me.
[02:00:41.176 --> 02:00:43.877]  We've been talking about what's fair game for the media.
[02:00:43.897 --> 02:00:47.419]  I mean, should we be allowed to criticize Ronald Reagan?
[02:00:47.939 --> 02:00:51.680]  George Will was really, really angry at Bill O'Reilly.
[02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:58.863]  He thinks that he has done irreparable harm to conservatism because Ronald Reagan was criticized.
[02:00:58.943 --> 02:01:03.145]  But he does have some valid criticisms about the sloppy research that Bill O'Reilly did.
[02:01:03.925 --> 02:01:06.646]  We've seen the same thing playing out with Ben Carson.
[02:01:06.986 --> 02:01:18.572]  People vetting the stories about his personal testimony about how he had an incredibly dangerous temper, but then that changed as he was converted as a Christian or whatever.
[02:01:18.632 --> 02:01:21.253]  But we've also seen the case of whether or not
[02:01:21.693 --> 02:01:29.036]  Is it true that General Westmoreland, the highest-ranking military official at the time, came to his high school and begged him to come to West Point, essentially?
[02:01:29.076 --> 02:01:31.797]  And he said, well, gee, thanks, General, but I'd rather not.
[02:01:32.077 --> 02:01:33.378]  So I thought this was very interesting.
[02:01:33.418 --> 02:01:35.539]  I want to get your take on this.
[02:01:35.939 --> 02:01:37.740]  This is a 17-second clip here.
[02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:38.720]  This is Sean Hannity.
[02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:44.542]  He gets him on his radio program and summarizes this Westmoreland claim.
[02:01:45.363 --> 02:01:47.364]  And he says, is this true or not?
[02:01:47.684 --> 02:01:48.384]  Ask him point blank.
[02:01:48.404 --> 02:01:50.365]  I want you to hear Ben Carson's answer.
[02:01:51.391 --> 02:02:00.438]  In your book, Gifted Hands, that you were 17 years old and you were introduced in 1969 to General William Westmoreland, who had just ended his command with the U.S.
[02:02:00.478 --> 02:02:03.040]  forces in Vietnam, and that you dined together.
[02:02:04.121 --> 02:02:04.601]  Is that true?
[02:02:06.123 --> 02:02:09.285]  It may well have been, but what I... Okay.
[02:02:09.906 --> 02:02:10.786]  It may well have been.
[02:02:11.487 --> 02:02:12.147]  It may well have been.
[02:02:12.268 --> 02:02:16.191]  I mean, I cannot confirm or deny whether this actually happened.
[02:02:16.251 --> 02:02:17.672]  Already sounding like a politician.
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:19.301]  But can you believe that?
[02:02:19.341 --> 02:02:21.003]  And of course, Sean Hannity doesn't skip a beat.
[02:02:21.063 --> 02:02:25.026]  He just keeps on going and building up Ben Carson, you know, and everything.
[02:02:25.066 --> 02:02:29.730]  And it's like, you give him the case there and say, did that happen?
[02:02:29.770 --> 02:02:31.112]  He goes, well, it may well have been.
[02:02:31.172 --> 02:02:33.173]  And then he goes on to say, well, you know, it's been about 40 years.
[02:02:33.214 --> 02:02:34.134]  I can't really remember.
[02:02:35.049 --> 02:02:36.871]  But somebody put that in the book.
[02:02:36.911 --> 02:02:37.111]  Yeah.
[02:02:37.191 --> 02:02:38.272]  And he's been selling that.
[02:02:38.313 --> 02:02:39.113]  He's done a book.
[02:02:39.133 --> 02:02:41.696]  He's done a movie about his life and all these details.
[02:02:41.716 --> 02:02:46.581]  And I think it's really sad that we're talking about what he did in high school.
[02:02:46.742 --> 02:02:49.645]  But he's the one that felt that he needed to boast about that.
[02:02:49.745 --> 02:02:51.827]  And I think it's fair game to look at this.
[02:02:51.867 --> 02:02:53.329]  And there was another story that was even
[02:02:54.910 --> 02:03:07.923]  More unbelievable than the Westmoreland story, but still, the facts that he presented that this happened around Memorial Day, I think, and the travel arrangements showed that Westmoreland wasn't in Detroit at that time and that sort of thing.
[02:03:08.163 --> 02:03:13.628]  But that's a very valid point that you bring up, just like when we talk about Hillary, and she's like, I stepped off a helicopter and people were shooting at me.
[02:03:14.108 --> 02:03:16.971]  You know, people go back and check that and they see that it never happens.
[02:03:16.991 --> 02:03:18.913]  She even stopped to sign an autograph for my girl.
[02:03:18.933 --> 02:03:19.453]  Sniper fire!
[02:03:20.174 --> 02:03:22.055]  Well, I understand why integrity is important.
[02:03:22.175 --> 02:03:24.915]  I mean, we can look at the position papers that people put out.
[02:03:24.935 --> 02:03:27.536]  I mean, I like a lot of the position papers that Trump put out.
[02:03:27.556 --> 02:03:31.417]  But then the question is, do I believe he has the character to follow through on this?
[02:03:31.437 --> 02:03:33.718]  Because, I mean, look at what we've seen with John Boehner.
[02:03:33.738 --> 02:03:34.899]  Look at what we've seen with Mitch McConnell.
[02:03:35.019 --> 02:03:36.059]  All the leadership, okay?
[02:03:36.879 --> 02:03:40.140]  Eric Cantor who has voted out and now we've got Paul Ryan in there.
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:42.881]  I mean this is, we have been betrayed over and over again.
[02:03:42.901 --> 02:03:46.101]  I mean the best we can do is say okay this is what they say they're going to do.
[02:03:46.181 --> 02:03:50.762]  He's the only candidate who's saying he's going to do X and that's my important issue so I'm going to send a message.
[02:03:50.782 --> 02:03:54.903]  I had lunch with one of the guys on Trump's legal team like a month ago.
[02:03:55.163 --> 02:03:57.504]  Sat down and had lunch with him out on Rainey Street or whatever.
[02:03:57.964 --> 02:04:00.787]  And he said, this is a guy that when he says he's going to do something, he does it.
[02:04:01.447 --> 02:04:04.630]  And then we had the guest in here the other day said the same thing.
[02:04:04.650 --> 02:04:07.633]  And that's what you're getting a lot from the people that know Trump personally.
[02:04:07.953 --> 02:04:09.014]  That's the kind of guy he is.
[02:04:09.034 --> 02:04:11.997]  But you're not really getting that from other candidates as well.
[02:04:12.017 --> 02:04:13.879]  But you have to understand, integrity is an issue.
[02:04:13.919 --> 02:04:18.863]  So it is an issue whether or not we can trust Ben Carson if he is panning his resume, you know.
[02:04:18.923 --> 02:04:20.665]  And of course, we have to take other people's word for it.
[02:04:20.685 --> 02:04:22.667]  But that is something that has to be vetted.
[02:04:22.867 --> 02:04:32.449]  Well, once you get in there, though, you might have really good intentions, but there are so many other things operating behind the scenes that, you know, they might say, listen, you're not going to get anything done.
[02:04:32.770 --> 02:04:36.851]  So you might as well take this big chunk of money and get this done.
[02:04:37.271 --> 02:04:44.933]  And so, you know... And again, that goes back to Ronald Reagan, whether or not he was mentally impaired and didn't get this done, or whether or not he just decided he was going to compromise.
[02:04:45.173 --> 02:04:46.193]  I am of the opinion
[02:04:46.733 --> 02:04:48.374]  That the fix was in from the very beginning.
[02:04:48.454 --> 02:04:51.717]  He was willing to compromise on principles and put George H.W.
[02:04:51.757 --> 02:04:58.761]  Bush in as his vice president so he could win the nomination, even though he had called everything he wanted to do voodoo economics and that sort of thing.
[02:04:58.802 --> 02:05:01.864]  I mean, I saw the compromise before the election.
[02:05:01.904 --> 02:05:02.724]  I think a lot of people did.
[02:05:03.265 --> 02:05:03.425]  Yeah.
[02:05:03.505 --> 02:05:04.145]  Well, thanks for joining us.
[02:05:04.165 --> 02:05:07.147]  When we come back, we're going to be talking to Anthony Gucciardi.
[02:05:07.187 --> 02:05:07.768]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:09.827 --> 02:05:12.148]  Joe Vicks here with InfoWars.com.
[02:05:12.348 --> 02:05:16.030]  Rand Paul calls Obama an idiot on foreign policy.
[02:05:16.070 --> 02:05:21.112]  What kind of idiot sends four people to war in a campaign stop in Iowa yesterday?
[02:05:21.213 --> 02:05:28.916]  Senator Rand Paul had some choice words for the president, labeling him an idiot over his handling of the situation in Syria.
[02:05:29.036 --> 02:05:29.977]  Bravo, Rand Paul.
[02:05:30.177 --> 02:05:30.477]  Bravo.
[02:05:30.717 --> 02:05:37.041]  Speaking to the crowd on military and foreign policy, Paul asks, what kind of idiot sends four people to war?
[02:05:37.161 --> 02:05:43.305]  The senator was referring to Obama's monumental fail in attempting to train Syrian rebels to fight ISIS.
[02:05:43.425 --> 02:05:53.492]  The program cost an estimated $500 million, but was aborted as it was revealed that just four or five trainers remained from an initial 54.
[02:05:54.333 --> 02:05:57.795]  If you go to war, you don't go with underwhelming force, you go to war with
[02:05:58.035 --> 02:06:00.696]  Overwhelming force, Paul further explained.
[02:06:00.816 --> 02:06:05.557]  Paul also spoke on arming the rebels, calling it crazy foolish to feed arms to people who ate us.
[02:06:05.717 --> 02:06:09.118]  You can check out the rest of this article at InfoWars.com.

[02:07:06.547 --> 02:07:09.689]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[02:07:09.729 --> 02:07:10.670]  Good, brother.
[02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:12.511]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:07:12.551 --> 02:07:14.333]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:07:14.493 --> 02:07:18.496]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:07:18.516 --> 02:07:21.098]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:07:21.138 --> 02:07:23.360]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:25.602]  Super Mill Vitality was developed.

[02:07:36.506 --> 02:07:39.407]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:07:39.427 --> 02:07:40.928]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:07:41.188 --> 02:07:43.629]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[02:07:44.970 --> 02:07:59.203]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going, goes right to the source.
[02:07:59.263 --> 02:08:00.964]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[02:08:14.173 --> 02:08:20.480]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:21.882 --> 02:08:25.226]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[02:08:26.636 --> 02:08:27.877]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:27.937 --> 02:08:30.999]  I'm David Knight, your host today, and joining me now is Anthony Gucciardi.
[02:08:31.579 --> 02:08:35.522]  At the bottom of the hour, we're going to have a special report from Alex Jones on how to defeat the new world order.
[02:08:36.063 --> 02:08:43.328]  In this report, Alex breaks down the fact we've reached a cultural tipping point, not just here in the United States, but worldwide.
[02:08:43.908 --> 02:08:48.931]  And we're going to talk exactly about what the Prime Minister of Hungary is saying about this.
[02:08:48.992 --> 02:08:51.854]  He sees this in exactly the same way that we do.
[02:08:52.634 --> 02:08:58.499]  Hungarian leader says immigration is a treasonous conspiracy to marginalize nation-states.
[02:08:58.539 --> 02:08:59.560]  This is from the New American.
[02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:07.866]  He says, this is a project that has failed to overcome Christianity and the identity of the nation-state and the values and responsibilities that spring from that.
[02:09:07.966 --> 02:09:13.350]  In conventional political struggle, it will strive to eliminate it now on ethnic grounds.
[02:09:13.771 --> 02:09:16.053]  They're going to divide and conquer us culturally.
[02:09:16.653 --> 02:09:25.744]  They're going to get rid of the national borders, and then they're going to bring in the New World Order with climate treaties, with trade, so-called trade treaties.
[02:09:26.184 --> 02:09:29.007]  Those, both, both of those treaties have
[02:09:30.026 --> 02:09:34.829]  Multinational governance built into them in terms of these governing committees.
[02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:39.713]  They have the ability to do economic sanctions to us.
[02:09:39.773 --> 02:09:46.958]  In one case, in the climate change scenario, they can directly tax us with a transnational governing body.
[02:09:47.639 --> 02:09:50.461]  Now, Orban, who is the Prime Minister of Turkey,
[02:09:51.505 --> 02:10:20.097]  says that uh... he was referring to collectivist open borders european union mentality that seeks to replace nationalism with internationalism this is the uh... new american article i'm reading from he says if countries can be so balkanized that people no longer are a people but rather than just a disparate collection of peoples then there will be little sense of nationhood hence little resistance to a loss of sovereignty and a dissolution of borders that's exactly the problem isn't it anthony they're going to balkanize
[02:10:20.997 --> 02:10:25.239]  The United States are going to balkanize, and we see this already happening, in Europe.
[02:10:26.079 --> 02:10:36.383]  And we know that once they do that, and they divide people, and they get rid of the national borders, as they've said, they're a figment of our imagination, they're a shibboleth, they need to go away.
[02:10:37.295 --> 02:10:47.522]  Well once they homogenize and assimilate everyone into the same linear system that they've established through the establishment system, then they will have complete control.
[02:10:47.562 --> 02:10:53.186]  And you know the biggest threat, I've always said, to the establishment structure, the corrupt structure, is not
[02:10:53.946 --> 02:10:55.287]  Change in certain areas.
[02:10:55.328 --> 02:11:00.132]  Like, let's say, oh, we could retake the food supply, or we could, you know, fight immigration or whatever.
[02:11:00.533 --> 02:11:06.959]  Those are all different sectors of it, but it's the idea of the desire for change that is the biggest threat.
[02:11:07.399 --> 02:11:15.127]  And so many people don't have that desire, for one reason or another, to the extent that, sure, let's say we fix the border situation.
[02:11:15.487 --> 02:11:16.268]  Right, that would be great.
[02:11:16.328 --> 02:11:17.929]  Or let's say we did retake the food supply.
[02:11:18.209 --> 02:11:18.589]  Amazing.
[02:11:19.210 --> 02:11:29.957]  But in 24 hours, less than 24 hours, we could change everything across the full spectrum if we just had 50% of people decide they want to change.
[02:11:30.457 --> 02:11:32.438]  Genuinely fight the establishment structure.
[02:11:32.518 --> 02:11:38.402]  And the way they fight that is if you say, I want change, I want to fix this, I want this reformed, they say, you're racist, you're sexist, you're this.
[02:11:38.783 --> 02:11:40.684]  The same thing we saw with the police brutality.
[02:11:40.744 --> 02:11:45.227]  I was talking about that situation that happened in an all-white community out in Idaho with a rancher getting shot.
[02:11:46.268 --> 02:11:52.812]  Very much a parallel of what we see happening in the cities, of them using excessive force, letting somebody bleed out without calling an ambulance and everything.
[02:11:52.852 --> 02:11:58.135]  But, you know, in New York, it's easy for them to turn that into a racial thing.
[02:11:58.195 --> 02:12:02.238]  And of course, that's another George Soros organization there, Black Lives Matter.
[02:12:02.718 --> 02:12:06.060]  And if they can do that, they can stifle that dissent.
[02:12:06.180 --> 02:12:08.662]  They can stifle that desire for reform.
[02:12:09.142 --> 02:12:22.445]  It's true, and what I want to talk about today is the big secret on how we're kept down by this establishment system, call it whatever you want, by the modern-day society, the corrupt government elements, whatever you really want to call it or believe it is.
[02:12:22.905 --> 02:12:33.408]  We are being kept down, and we are forced against uprising in many ways through so many different things, and I want to break it all down through the political correctness, but it really starts at birth.
[02:12:33.928 --> 02:12:37.429]  And I've got a number of studies I want to get to on this subject and some other news as well.
[02:12:37.949 --> 02:12:45.051]  But if you think about it, all of us really are born with different traits and skills and opportunities, right?
[02:12:45.091 --> 02:12:47.692]  Some of us are born with a creativity side, right?
[02:12:47.712 --> 02:12:49.632]  Some of us want to be painters or musicians.
[02:12:50.013 --> 02:12:52.293]  Some of us are calculus experts, right?
[02:12:52.913 --> 02:12:54.554]  Everyone's passion is something but different.
[02:12:54.974 --> 02:12:58.375]  And what the establishment does is it takes all of these people
[02:12:58.655 --> 02:13:07.823]  Imagine billions of people and shoves them into a trash compactor and just starts smashing them up to make them more, you know, processed.
[02:13:08.103 --> 02:13:09.124]  It's kind of like the food supply.
[02:13:09.144 --> 02:13:10.305]  It's kind of like the school system.
[02:13:10.605 --> 02:13:12.486]  We are the food supply, right?
[02:13:12.787 --> 02:13:18.812]  There's apples and tomatoes and oranges and corn and all these amazing vegetables and fruits and, you know, produce.
[02:13:19.452 --> 02:13:22.575]  And it's almost like the establishment says, no, I just want spam.
[02:13:22.595 --> 02:13:23.236]  You know that meat?
[02:13:23.817 --> 02:13:26.079]  They just say, no, we want to make spam from all of this.
[02:13:26.119 --> 02:13:27.140]  Then we want to make goulash.
[02:13:27.180 --> 02:13:29.843]  So they just shove it all in a trash compactor and build it all up.
[02:13:30.103 --> 02:13:30.744]  It's all in green.
[02:13:31.084 --> 02:13:31.645]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:31.705 --> 02:13:35.989]  But it's like, it's like if Nikolai Tesla were born today.
[02:13:36.690 --> 02:13:37.891]  He would probably work at 7-11.
[02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:09.210]  That I would just be a complete failure.
[02:14:09.410 --> 02:14:10.711]  I mean, you know how many people told me that?
[02:14:10.891 --> 02:14:12.451]  A lot of people told me that.
[02:14:12.611 --> 02:14:17.892]  And people I know are just so depressed and upset because they don't want to be homogenized.
[02:14:18.392 --> 02:14:19.392]  They're on the far spectrum.
[02:14:19.432 --> 02:14:20.452]  Maybe they're extremely creative.
[02:14:20.492 --> 02:14:22.593]  Maybe a lot of listeners right now are extremely creative.
[02:14:22.613 --> 02:14:26.253]  They're being forced into a data collection job or some garbage, right?
[02:14:26.453 --> 02:14:27.494]  They're just so upset.
[02:14:27.794 --> 02:14:35.755]  It's the establishment ruining any ability that we have to uprise, any ability to speak our talents and help people.
[02:14:36.115 --> 02:14:37.755]  And have individuality and freedom.
[02:14:37.855 --> 02:14:51.319]  You know, I would rather my sons be a self-employed plumber than to be a highly paid bureaucrat in this oppressive regime, you know, spying on people or, you know, interfering in other people's lives and ruining their lives, you know, as an interloper.
[02:14:51.659 --> 02:15:01.681]  I would prefer that they take a job, regardless of the amount of money that they have, that gives them freedom and independence in a self-employed situation, because that's what I value.
[02:15:01.681 --> 02:15:06.986]  Well, it's whatever, I believe, whatever they can do, they want to do, and they can make it in such a way that they help other people.
[02:15:07.046 --> 02:15:07.466]  Exactly.
[02:15:07.646 --> 02:15:07.786]  Right?
[02:15:07.867 --> 02:15:09.588]  Not making money by hurting people.
[02:15:09.608 --> 02:15:10.089]  That's right.
[02:15:10.209 --> 02:15:12.711]  And if they make money, make it for the money, that's awesome.
[02:15:12.871 --> 02:15:14.212]  More good people need to make money.
[02:15:14.693 --> 02:15:17.555]  But we need to make money and be able to help people at the same time.
[02:15:17.755 --> 02:15:18.856]  But if you look at Japan,
[02:15:19.597 --> 02:15:20.578]  This is from BBC.
[02:15:20.658 --> 02:15:23.201]  Why does Japan have such a high suicide rate?
[02:15:23.241 --> 02:15:23.961]  It's astronomical.
[02:15:24.502 --> 02:15:27.805]  Last year in Japan, more than 25,000 people took their own lives.
[02:15:28.065 --> 02:15:29.206]  That's 70 every day.
[02:15:29.286 --> 02:15:30.828]  The vast majority were men.
[02:15:31.208 --> 02:15:34.771]  These figures do not make Japan the highest suicide rate in the world and developed nation.
[02:15:35.412 --> 02:15:37.274]  That dubious title belongs to South Korea.
[02:15:37.594 --> 02:15:40.737]  But it is still far, far higher than virtually all other wealthy countries.
[02:15:40.897 --> 02:15:41.738]  Well, gee, why is that?
[02:15:41.778 --> 02:15:43.159]  And why is it the same with South Korea?
[02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:57.649]  Because the work system, the establishment system, the corporate, vampiric system where you are a pig and it just leeches on you and drinks your blood, you will work, you will work 12 hours a day, you will support your family.
[02:15:57.669 --> 02:16:01.812]  If you don't have a 401k, if you don't bring home money for your family, you will be shamed.
[02:16:02.352 --> 02:16:03.113]  You are a failure.
[02:16:03.133 --> 02:16:04.234]  You must support those systems.
[02:16:04.554 --> 02:16:12.239]  And to the point where I've talked to people that worked at Samsung and stuff, they would sleep there and they would just tell their wives and stuff, I'm busy at the real family.
[02:16:12.579 --> 02:16:13.760]  It was work before family.
[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:14.781]  We're good to go.
[02:16:28.797 --> 02:16:30.959]  I'm not saying quit your job and become hippie on the beach.
[02:16:31.379 --> 02:16:34.362]  I'm saying to realize this is how they keep us down is very important.
[02:16:34.382 --> 02:16:38.645]  That's why there's very few leaders out there, because no one has the courage to break free from the mold.
[02:16:39.045 --> 02:16:45.691]  Understand how society is forcing its values on you, forcing you to do something.
[02:16:46.051 --> 02:16:52.857]  I have friends back in North Carolina, they were Japanese and they had an expression, the nail that sticks up gets hammered down.
[02:16:53.297 --> 02:16:56.158]  Okay, they did not want to have any individuality.
[02:16:56.198 --> 02:16:59.739]  They wanted your values to be those of the corporation that you work for.
[02:17:00.239 --> 02:17:02.740]  Those of the society that you were meant to serve.
[02:17:02.780 --> 02:17:04.320]  You were to be a cog in the wheel.
[02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:10.242]  When we adopted my daughter from China, her foster family that she had been living with gave her a note.
[02:17:10.282 --> 02:17:11.102]  We had it translated.
[02:17:11.142 --> 02:17:13.323]  It says, uh, obey your government.
[02:17:13.903 --> 02:17:15.224]  Do what you are told.
[02:17:15.384 --> 02:17:17.686]  I mean, that's what they are told.
[02:17:17.706 --> 02:17:20.448]  That was his parting advice to her, you know, obey your government.
[02:17:20.468 --> 02:17:23.050]  I said, well, he's going to get a different education from me.
[02:17:23.510 --> 02:17:24.391]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:17:24.431 --> 02:17:32.657]  I mean, if the establishment had their way, the corrupt elements in the government, the corporate system that makes money off it, you know, it's all for profit gain and all that kind of stuff.
[02:17:33.077 --> 02:17:38.341]  You would just be a drone human being that wore all white or all black.
[02:17:38.662 --> 02:17:40.083]  You would have no different, you know,
[02:17:40.643 --> 02:17:52.346]  Facial structure, you just be a clone creature that just works and goes in and collects data and types on a keyboard and leaves and goes home to your IV that just sucks your blood and donates it and sells it to the corporations.
[02:17:52.386 --> 02:17:53.546]  I mean, truly, truly.
[02:17:53.566 --> 02:18:00.908]  And if we look at the single view, and I have to get the onion thing that my son sent me, it was absolutely hilarious.
[02:18:01.928 --> 02:18:06.409]  It was something that was put out as a mock thing from a university saying, we do support
[02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:08.710]  The viewpoint, you know.
[02:18:08.770 --> 02:18:10.630]  In other words, a single viewpoint we're going to support.
[02:18:10.690 --> 02:18:21.274]  And that's what's really behind all of this political correctness, all this shaming of anybody if you question the viewpoint that is being put out by the establishment.
[02:18:21.534 --> 02:18:24.515]  And that's the real essence of a college education.
[02:18:25.115 --> 02:18:30.478]  Is to make sure that you conform, okay, in the name of whatever they're doing at that point in time.
[02:18:30.518 --> 02:18:38.361]  Whether it's some phony narrative about white privilege or racism or sexism or whatever, the boogeyman of the year.
[02:18:38.401 --> 02:18:41.823]  That's not really even important as it is that they can shame you.
[02:18:42.603 --> 02:18:53.748]  Into doing whatever they want you to do, because if we allow them to get away with this, then we're going to have the kind of regimented, structured societies that you see throughout Asia, through Japan, through South Korea and other places like that.
[02:18:53.968 --> 02:18:57.790]  Political correctness, without question, is a form of control and dominance.
[02:18:58.290 --> 02:19:05.553]  It is a form of mental tyranny, because it can take over an ideology and just destroy it.
[02:19:05.853 --> 02:19:07.734]  It can control people like nothing else.
[02:19:07.994 --> 02:19:10.796]  For example, if we're having a conversation and you say anything
[02:19:11.596 --> 02:19:17.057]  In a public setting and I declare you a racist, I instantly have power over you if you don't know how to handle that situation.
[02:19:17.398 --> 02:19:20.238]  Let's say we're talking about something and you go, I don't like that black suit.
[02:19:20.258 --> 02:19:23.739]  And I said, oh my god, how racist of you, in front of 20 people though.
[02:19:24.139 --> 02:19:25.600]  I instantly have power in the room.
[02:19:26.100 --> 02:19:37.743]  Because no one is going to defy the political correctness because they've been trained through this system of the schooling system of the parents that buy into this, this fake weak system that, oh my god, you can't defend anyone.
[02:19:38.183 --> 02:19:41.906]  That I have power now by calling you racist and it's in your court to defend yourself.
[02:19:42.166 --> 02:19:42.407]  Absolutely.
[02:19:42.427 --> 02:19:43.267]  But you don't play that game.
[02:19:43.307 --> 02:19:44.809]  You say this is absolutely ridiculous.
[02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:49.012]  But that's what's brilliant and popular about Donald Trump.
[02:19:49.332 --> 02:19:51.274]  He refuses to play that game.
[02:19:51.534 --> 02:19:53.216]  He refuses to be shamed by that.
[02:19:53.536 --> 02:19:58.580]  And regardless of whether you agree with his policies or not, that I think is a key thing behind it.
[02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:00.482]  The more they attack him, the more popular he gets.
[02:20:00.722 --> 02:20:04.225]  We'll be right back with Anthony Gucciardi and a special report from Alex Jones at the bottom of the hour.
[02:20:09.947 --> 02:20:12.069]  Don't take a cold or flu lying down.
[02:20:12.450 --> 02:20:15.232]  Stand up and fight back with Supernatural Silver.

[02:22:07.564 --> 02:22:08.385]  Come and take it.
[02:22:09.005 --> 02:22:12.007]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[02:22:12.327 --> 02:22:17.471]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[02:22:17.811 --> 02:22:19.713]  But they're about to lose control.
[02:22:20.093 --> 02:22:25.077]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[02:22:25.397 --> 02:22:29.860]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[02:22:29.980 --> 02:22:32.021]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[02:22:32.382 --> 02:22:35.884]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[02:22:36.224 --> 02:22:39.526]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[02:22:39.646 --> 02:22:40.307]  And they did.
[02:22:40.747 --> 02:22:43.649]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[02:22:43.869 --> 02:22:46.271]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[02:22:46.451 --> 02:22:47.852]  This will affect us all.
[02:22:48.312 --> 02:22:51.814]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[02:22:53.035 --> 02:22:59.303]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.

[02:23:10.245 --> 02:23:13.967]  Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day.
[02:23:14.207 --> 02:23:17.968]  And the home security industry wants you to believe that's your only option.
[02:23:18.248 --> 02:23:23.431]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[02:23:23.711 --> 02:23:28.313]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[02:23:28.613 --> 02:23:31.834]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.
[02:23:32.134 --> 02:23:34.215]  But there's a better way to protect your home.
[02:23:34.555 --> 02:23:36.116]  SimpliSafe Home Security.

[02:24:14.970 --> 02:24:25.347]  I hear the train a-comin' It's rollin' around the bend And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
[02:24:27.532 --> 02:24:29.453]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:29.473 --> 02:24:32.054]  I'm David Knight, your host, and joining me now is Anthony Gucciardi.
[02:24:32.074 --> 02:24:45.538]  We've been talking about the way we are controlled, the political correctness, the different ways that they enforce homogeneity on us, the way they intimidate us, the way they shame us, and what can we do to take control of our own lives.
[02:24:45.558 --> 02:24:47.539]  Well, one of the things you can do is you can take control of your health.
[02:24:48.299 --> 02:24:49.420]  He's talking about a bigger picture.
[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:52.341]  We're going to have a special report from Alex Jones at the bottom of the hour.
[02:24:52.921 --> 02:24:55.942]  But we do have some specials at Infowarslife.com right now.
[02:24:55.982 --> 02:24:56.983]  You know, winter is coming up.
[02:24:57.023 --> 02:25:00.444]  We've got winter sun, vitamin D3 at 20% off.
[02:25:00.984 --> 02:25:04.186]  This is only until the end of this weekend, a good time to stock up on this.
[02:25:04.226 --> 02:25:12.029]  You know, you get vitamin D3 from your exposure to the sun, but as the sun gets weaker, as the days get shorter,
[02:25:12.869 --> 02:25:13.350]  Things happen.
[02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:14.130]  That's why it cools off.
[02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:17.251]  That's why when we talk about climate change, we do talk about the sun.
[02:25:17.311 --> 02:25:22.294]  It has something to do with it, folks, a lot more than you would believe, be led to believe by the mainstream media.
[02:25:22.554 --> 02:25:25.596]  Nevertheless, you can get Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[02:25:25.616 --> 02:25:29.017]  It's completely free of GMO, of toxins, of additives.
[02:25:29.477 --> 02:25:32.779]  It's an ultra-clean lab-tested source of D3.
[02:25:33.219 --> 02:25:35.721]  It's highly bioavailable in a liquid form.
[02:25:35.741 --> 02:25:36.541]  You can get that right now.
[02:25:36.681 --> 02:25:42.104]  Twenty percent off Infowarslife.com and real briefly, we have just introduced Living Defense.
[02:25:42.164 --> 02:25:50.108]  This is something that is a new product that uses wild crafted and organic herbs to help naturally cleanse harmful organisms out of your body.
[02:25:50.188 --> 02:25:58.893]  Nine out of ten people are infested with these kinds of harmful organisms, so you can use something that is natural, that is organic to help to cleanse them out.
[02:25:59.013 --> 02:26:00.374]  We're expected to sell out this week.
[02:26:00.854 --> 02:26:07.857]  This is our first limited run, so it's available right now at InfoWarsLife.com, but we expect it to sell out shortly.
[02:26:07.897 --> 02:26:08.898]  You can get that right now.
[02:26:08.938 --> 02:26:12.380]  That's LivingDefense at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:26:13.100 --> 02:26:20.363]  Now, Anthony, we were talking in the last segment about not just specific things that you can do, but what is the big picture?
[02:26:20.403 --> 02:26:24.085]  And that's what we've got with the special report coming up from Alex at the bottom of the hour.
[02:26:24.665 --> 02:26:25.826]  But continue with what you were saying.
[02:26:26.286 --> 02:26:35.830]  The narrative that is really the big picture is this ideology that's passed down by parents or it's passed down by universities or schools or institutions or the media or Hollywood.
[02:26:35.850 --> 02:26:44.414]  It's really a uniform attack that you have to follow the establishment system or you are a failure and your success
[02:26:45.154 --> 02:26:51.639]  And your life is measured by those parameters and those parameters only, which is probably the biggest lie ever told.
[02:26:52.059 --> 02:27:07.510]  And it's the reason people kill themselves, it's the reason that we're depressed, it's the reason that we don't have real change on a daily basis, it's the reason that we're desperate for a true leader, it's the reason that people are absolutely clamoring over Trump in many ways, because he's kind of going against the narrative.
[02:27:08.251 --> 02:27:10.712]  Say what you will about him, he goes against the narrative in many ways.
[02:27:11.393 --> 02:27:13.554]  But what happens is, and it's kind of like this article,
[02:27:14.435 --> 02:27:24.820]  It says, kids of helicopter parents are sputtering out, which is a silly title, but it says, recent studies suggest that kids with over-involved parents and rigidly structured childhoods suffer psychological blowback in college.
[02:27:25.540 --> 02:27:37.926]  Basically, they're getting depressed, they're killing themselves, they're going to college, and what's happening is, it's not, it is the parents' fault, but it's not, because what happens is, and I'm not a parenting expert, I'm just talking about the psychology of it,
[02:27:38.852 --> 02:27:46.540]  These children grow up and their parents are maybe lawyers or doctors or accountants or whatever it is that the establishment rewards.
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:47.381]  Like, oh, a lawyer.
[02:27:48.242 --> 02:27:52.106]  And they're like, well, and I've met tons of people like this that have extreme anxiety.
[02:27:52.406 --> 02:27:56.190]  Well, I have to make my parents happy and follow this establishment system.
[02:27:56.790 --> 02:27:59.472]  I need to go to law school and become a lawyer or I'm worthless.
[02:28:00.032 --> 02:28:00.232]  Right?
[02:28:00.292 --> 02:28:06.576]  Maybe even though they were born with talents for art or something like that or science or something.
[02:28:06.596 --> 02:28:06.756]  No!
[02:28:07.037 --> 02:28:09.758]  I have to follow the linear structure of the establishment or I'm a loser.
[02:28:10.479 --> 02:28:11.520]  So many people think this.
[02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:15.982]  We all think this in many ways because the establishment is just hitting us like a spider.
[02:28:16.263 --> 02:28:18.124]  But I think a key part of that is school.
[02:28:18.444 --> 02:28:19.725]  That's where a lot of this stuff starts.
[02:28:19.825 --> 02:28:21.166]  I know who homeschooled our kids
[02:28:22.126 --> 02:28:30.169]  We were looking at this and it's like, alright, well, you know, they want me to take these tests, have the kids take these tests and everything, but if you teach to the test, you know, you want the kids to do well on the test.
[02:28:30.349 --> 02:28:34.431]  So then you style your curriculum to teach to that test and so forth and so on.
[02:28:34.451 --> 02:28:41.554]  So then you're teaching what they want you to teach in the sequence that they want you to teach stuff in the way that they want you to teach it.
[02:28:41.974 --> 02:28:43.435]  We just said, we don't care about that.
[02:28:43.595 --> 02:28:46.196]  It was a very freeing thing to say, I don't really care about the tests.
[02:28:46.536 --> 02:28:47.876]  We're not going to teach you that.
[02:28:48.657 --> 02:28:51.938]  I could care less about how they do on tests because you know what?
[02:28:52.298 --> 02:28:54.658]  Kids fail in government schools all the time.
[02:28:55.038 --> 02:28:56.639]  They've got a very high failure rate.
[02:28:56.659 --> 02:29:01.980]  So it's like if they can't get the kids to take the test, I really could care less about what their scope and their sequence is.
[02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:04.141]  So we're going to follow what we're interested in.
[02:29:04.801 --> 02:29:08.262]  And you have to at some point, you have to just say that about everything in your life.
[02:29:08.562 --> 02:29:14.524]  I'm not going to let somebody else set my priorities and bound me into their idea of what I should be.
[02:29:14.924 --> 02:29:36.731]  See, and that's the main point, and I also want to get into how failure to understand details is probably one of the other biggest issues, but specifically, let's say these kids, you know, they don't want to be a lawyer or whatever, but the system tells them they have to, their parents tell them they have to, they have a psychological break, some of them kill themselves, but to put that in a broader spectrum, imagine if me and you decided to follow this narrative and go to school and become plumbers or whatever.
[02:29:37.011 --> 02:29:46.276]  I mean, we would have went against what we are meant to do, and so many people are failing to understand that as well, and it's a sad thing, and that's how the establishment keeps us down on a daily basis and stops us from rising up.
[02:29:46.436 --> 02:29:46.796]  That's right.
[02:29:47.037 --> 02:29:47.517]  Absolutely.
[02:29:47.557 --> 02:29:51.299]  How to Find Freedom in an Unfree World is a book that Harry Brown wrote.
[02:29:51.739 --> 02:29:52.820]  That's a good example.
[02:29:53.180 --> 02:29:55.461]  We're going to be right back with Alex Jones' special report.
[02:29:55.721 --> 02:29:57.082]  We'll tell you about it when we come back.
[02:29:59.123 --> 02:30:00.004]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.504 --> 02:30:02.105]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.045 --> 02:30:05.707]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:40.544 --> 02:31:42.666]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:31:42.766 --> 02:31:47.491]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:31:47.751 --> 02:31:50.894]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:31:51.034 --> 02:31:54.237]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:31:54.537 --> 02:31:56.279]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:31:56.499 --> 02:31:57.399]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:31:57.419 --> 02:31:58.380]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:31:58.620 --> 02:32:00.480]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[02:32:11.144 --> 02:32:12.565]  Oil of oregano formulation.
[02:32:12.845 --> 02:32:18.127]  We have now procured the most high-quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[02:32:18.447 --> 02:32:20.528]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form.
[02:32:20.928 --> 02:32:26.352]  Of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[02:32:26.793 --> 02:32:32.477]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[02:32:32.917 --> 02:32:41.604]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:32:42.044 --> 02:32:47.870]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[02:32:48.250 --> 02:32:54.636]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:32:54.996 --> 02:33:00.141]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[02:33:00.381 --> 02:33:02.543]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:33:02.843 --> 02:33:04.865]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:33:10.493 --> 02:33:12.756]  Well, everybody's heard about the bird.
[02:33:13.116 --> 02:33:14.078]  Bird, bird, bird.
[02:33:14.358 --> 02:33:15.099]  The bird's the word.
[02:33:15.179 --> 02:33:16.500]  Oh, well, the bird, bird, bird.
[02:33:16.761 --> 02:33:17.502]  Bird is the word.
[02:33:17.582 --> 02:33:18.863]  Oh, well, the bird, bird, bird.
[02:33:18.883 --> 02:33:19.924]  Well, the bird is the word.
[02:33:20.005 --> 02:33:21.326]  Oh, well, the bird, bird, bird.
[02:33:21.346 --> 02:33:22.387]  The bird is the word.
[02:33:22.407 --> 02:33:23.709]  Oh, well, the bird, bird, bird.
[02:33:23.829 --> 02:33:24.630]  Bird is the word.
[02:33:31.218 --> 02:33:35.701]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:35.721 --> 02:33:38.683]  I'm David Knight, and Anthony Gucciardi is here with me in the studio.
[02:33:39.003 --> 02:33:43.847]  We're going to play a special report from Alex Jones, and you know, it was interesting, Anthony and I were just talking about this.
[02:33:44.047 --> 02:33:45.608]  He had no idea what this report was.
[02:33:45.868 --> 02:33:49.671]  We're all on the same wavelength here, because we know what is happening.
[02:33:49.711 --> 02:33:51.532]  We can see what's happening in Europe.
[02:33:51.712 --> 02:33:53.813]  We can see what's happening in the United States.
[02:33:54.494 --> 02:33:58.877]  And as Alex Jones points out in this report, we've reached a cultural tipping point.
[02:33:59.597 --> 02:34:01.980]  Not just here in the U.S., but also in Europe.
[02:34:02.020 --> 02:34:05.383]  The elites are trying to suppress us under a form of cultural tyranny.
[02:34:05.884 --> 02:34:08.366]  Now the rebellion is boiling up to the surface.
[02:34:08.406 --> 02:34:10.568]  We've reached a cultural tipping point, a crossroads.
[02:34:10.629 --> 02:34:18.316]  It's time for people across the spectrum to become leaders, to stand up, to say no, and to point out that we see how they're trying to control us.
[02:34:18.336 --> 02:34:20.599]  That's just what Anthony was talking about as we've been here.
[02:34:21.099 --> 02:34:24.141]  Only by transcending the control paradigm can we defeat them.
[02:34:24.201 --> 02:34:29.885]  So it's very hard to do, while at the same time it can also be very, very easy to do.
[02:34:29.945 --> 02:34:30.825]  Here's Alex Jones.
[02:34:32.666 --> 02:34:36.609]  My friends, I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.
[02:34:37.669 --> 02:34:40.151]  But I say we're in a culture war.
[02:34:41.452 --> 02:34:44.754]  But the controlled media has divided it into conservative and liberal.
[02:34:46.069 --> 02:34:51.697]  When you pull back from that and study the different congressional hearings and other key documents...
[02:34:52.665 --> 02:34:55.426]  On Operation Mockingbird and other CIA operations.
[02:34:56.006 --> 02:35:16.035]  You learn that there are big foundations, multinational corporations, think tanks, intelligence agencies, private corporate criminal groups, and others that for the last hundred years have been meeting in large global conferences discussing aligning their interests to bring in a one world corporate government.
[02:35:17.035 --> 02:35:18.536]  Now they've had some wars with each other.
[02:35:18.976 --> 02:35:20.197]  They've had some major disagreements.
[02:35:21.527 --> 02:35:23.047]  And that's still going on to this day.
[02:35:23.067 --> 02:35:29.349]  The Anglo-American establishment, the Chinese, now the Communist Chinese, and of course the Russians.
[02:35:30.249 --> 02:35:40.692]  The Germans for a time vied to be a fourth group, and were destroyed, conquered, assimilated, and now are used as the slave engine of the EU, the core of world government.
[02:35:42.093 --> 02:35:44.534]  That said, we talk a lot about the info war.
[02:35:45.174 --> 02:35:47.834]  We talk about how we're having big victories fighting mainstream news.
[02:35:48.755 --> 02:35:49.415]  Dinosaur media.
[02:35:50.930 --> 02:35:57.212]  But I've talked also a lot about the fact that most propaganda is in movies, is in fiction television, fiction novels.
[02:35:58.633 --> 02:36:02.794]  That's where the real war is going on.
[02:36:02.814 --> 02:36:06.176]  We have to focus more and more on the propaganda, on the messages.
[02:36:06.216 --> 02:36:09.597]  And when you look at the messages that dominate
[02:36:11.186 --> 02:36:15.828]  The so-called spectrum of fiction that's being pushed by the big six media companies.
[02:36:16.608 --> 02:36:17.909]  It's anti-private property.
[02:36:18.009 --> 02:36:19.050]  It's anti-free will.
[02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:20.490]  It's anti-family.
[02:36:20.530 --> 02:36:21.611]  It's anti-self-defense.
[02:36:22.231 --> 02:36:23.412]  It's anti-free choice.
[02:36:24.112 --> 02:36:26.573]  It is anti-true classical liberalism.
[02:36:27.734 --> 02:36:32.556]  And I've been hammering on this real liberal versus fake liberal.
[02:36:32.576 --> 02:36:34.096]  We've had a major breakthrough.
[02:36:34.137 --> 02:36:37.538]  So what I'm about to cover here is one of the major keys to unlocking all of this.
[02:36:38.238 --> 02:36:39.279]  But you have to unlock it.
[02:36:40.350 --> 02:36:42.491]  And what I'm going to point out is something a lot of you already know.
[02:36:44.271 --> 02:36:52.994]  We've seen articles in the Washington Times and the LA Times and others about closeted libertarians and conservatives in Hollywood and how they have secret meetings.
[02:36:54.474 --> 02:36:57.495]  I have been led into some of those quote secret meetings.
[02:36:57.555 --> 02:37:00.436]  It's just small groups of people getting together and talking about the paradigm.
[02:37:01.417 --> 02:37:05.638]  And they've told me about even larger groups that they've met in secret intellectual circles.
[02:37:06.963 --> 02:37:17.527]  Of what you would call some of the most truly liberal people out there who are bullied and threatened into being establishment liberals or they're told you won't get any more roles no matter how many hits you've had.
[02:37:19.387 --> 02:37:23.509]  Now Hollywood's lost some of its power over the years and it's become decentralized to a certain extent.
[02:37:23.929 --> 02:37:25.109]  Not completely, but partially.
[02:37:26.210 --> 02:37:28.390]  It's moved to Canada, moved to Texas, moved to New Zealand.
[02:37:29.511 --> 02:37:30.031]  Other areas.
[02:37:31.051 --> 02:37:36.213]  So there's a little more courage now to tell the truth.
[02:37:39.181 --> 02:37:45.104]  The true liberals in Hollywood don't like the fact that they have to then join the conservatives, which are just as bad in most respects, the rhinos.
[02:37:46.564 --> 02:37:51.947]  Now, you know I've had a lot of big Hollywood people on the show, from Viggo Mortensen to basically you name it.
[02:37:52.727 --> 02:37:55.629]  And a lot of big stars have tweeted or talked about how they like Alex Jones.
[02:37:57.049 --> 02:38:02.612]  But the really big ones, people even bigger than some of the folks I've had on, are scared to come out and scared to go public.
[02:38:04.312 --> 02:38:12.741]  To the point of, like, every few weeks now, a major Hollywood star reaches out to me one way or another, but are always like, but just don't tell anybody that we're on board.
[02:38:13.041 --> 02:38:14.683]  Well, I already know you're on board.
[02:38:15.524 --> 02:38:18.267]  And you're not on board with Alex Jones or Infowars.com.
[02:38:18.287 --> 02:38:19.328]  We're just a focal point.
[02:38:20.389 --> 02:38:22.591]  And every time I talk to these folks, they're not just listening to me.
[02:38:23.092 --> 02:38:25.555]  They're dialed into all of it, more than I am in many respects.
[02:38:27.062 --> 02:38:30.005]  They're smarter than I am in many ways, more eloquent, better looking.
[02:38:30.565 --> 02:38:31.586]  They could change the world.
[02:38:32.046 --> 02:38:33.087]  And they're getting ready to do it.
[02:38:33.668 --> 02:38:35.449]  People are really tired of what's happening.
[02:38:35.790 --> 02:38:38.512]  They're tired of the global fascism that comes from both parties.
[02:38:38.952 --> 02:38:40.193]  They see the same stuff in Europe.
[02:38:41.055 --> 02:38:41.575]  They're upset.
[02:38:42.296 --> 02:38:47.337]  But they understand there's cultural bullying going on and that's what modern fake liberalism is.
[02:38:48.058 --> 02:38:55.301]  It's not whacked out that they want to ban brown paper bags and pull down Thomas Jefferson statues and ban the words mother and father, he and she, boy or girl.
[02:38:55.521 --> 02:38:56.461]  You think that's too extreme?
[02:38:56.521 --> 02:38:59.722]  It's meant to be extreme to break our will to accept anything.
[02:39:01.483 --> 02:39:02.603]  Now I've already said most of this.
[02:39:02.644 --> 02:39:05.645]  What I'm getting at is that there's a culture war going on.
[02:39:06.721 --> 02:39:14.888]  The globalists pump out all this mindless confusion and garbage and infighting, and controlled left and controlled right, so that people just tune out and don't have any hope.
[02:39:15.848 --> 02:39:17.870]  I'm here to tell you there's major hope.
[02:39:19.471 --> 02:39:26.057]  And we have to realize how popular the anti-globalist, pro-human, New Renaissance movement, as I've branded it, is.
[02:39:26.917 --> 02:39:27.618]  The New Enlightenment.
[02:39:29.380 --> 02:39:30.921]  The second wave, it's here.
[02:39:31.581 --> 02:39:37.005]  And all of this tyranny we see is an admitted attempt, I mean the Globalist White Papers are public, we cover them on air all the time.
[02:39:38.186 --> 02:39:40.928]  They're admitting they're in a war against true cultural freedom.
[02:39:41.764 --> 02:39:46.369]  I mean, you look at what comes out of the Democratic Party that's the dominant culture in America, that's the dominant culture in the world.
[02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:49.613]  It is Jim Jones-level programming, and it's meant to be.
[02:39:49.633 --> 02:39:54.838]  I had a top professor on just yesterday who heads up the Asian Studies Department at UC Davis.
[02:39:55.279 --> 02:40:02.707]  He went to the Rockefeller program, and he says, no, it's an admitted Maoist program actually following Mao tactics in the meetings to brainwash and screw up the young people.
[02:40:04.215 --> 02:40:07.217]  And to take all their faith and love for humanity and twist it.
[02:40:07.238 --> 02:40:10.660]  That's why you see these zombies out breaking up free speech events.
[02:40:10.700 --> 02:40:16.445]  They look so upset and so crazy and so wild-eyed because they've been screwed with, folks, with high-tech sciences.
[02:40:18.166 --> 02:40:19.027]  So here's what I'm getting at.
[02:40:19.147 --> 02:40:23.511]  I've talked a lot about voting with your dollars, voting with your mouth, voting with your feet, voting with what you support.
[02:40:24.252 --> 02:40:25.633]  But also what you produce.
[02:40:25.833 --> 02:40:29.654]  You need to do your own YouTube channels or set up your own video systems, whatever.
[02:40:29.734 --> 02:40:36.177]  You need to invade these corporate systems and then push their traffic back towards your alternative site.
[02:40:36.197 --> 02:40:48.943]  Not that you're going to have all the answers, but it'll be another point that isn't within the system for us to get back to our real reality by pinging info off each other, not just the controlled feedback loop that the globalists are pushing at us.
[02:40:50.559 --> 02:40:54.197]  And what made me think about this was a couple things the last few days.
[02:40:55.877 --> 02:40:58.338]  One big one was yesterday, we put out a fun little ad video.
[02:40:58.358 --> 02:40:59.239]  We gotta fund ourselves.
[02:40:59.759 --> 02:41:03.921]  The Global Sack, like it's bad for any new cultural movement to have its own funding.
[02:41:04.102 --> 02:41:05.582]  They tax us and use our money against us.
[02:41:05.822 --> 02:41:09.204]  It's bad if we, with free will, write a book or make a film or sell a product.
[02:41:09.765 --> 02:41:12.166]  Again, trying to intimidate us as if we can't have ideas.
[02:41:12.366 --> 02:41:14.067]  When we have ideas, it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:41:14.447 --> 02:41:17.349]  When we have an opinion or a taste, it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:41:17.669 --> 02:41:18.209]  Or extreme.
[02:41:18.749 --> 02:41:21.271]  Or when we build our own system and are successful, it's bad.
[02:41:22.031 --> 02:41:23.012]  Well, of course that's what they say.
[02:41:23.812 --> 02:41:33.076]  But we shot this video, some of my friends barefoot skiing, and they love one of our products, and a minority of the comments were like, how dare you be water skiing when everything's falling apart?
[02:41:33.696 --> 02:41:35.017]  You need to be fighting the new world order.
[02:41:35.837 --> 02:41:38.938]  This from people that, I went and looked at their channels, have done nothing.
[02:41:38.958 --> 02:41:41.099]  They're like playing video games and stuff.
[02:41:41.139 --> 02:41:42.339]  Fine, just don't judge me.
[02:41:43.540 --> 02:41:48.862]  Part of winning the fight against the tyrants is not being a bunch of scared, upset people in secret meetings.
[02:41:49.002 --> 02:41:49.963]  It's part of
[02:41:51.579 --> 02:41:54.741]  Going out, having fun, creating our own culture, our own music.
[02:41:55.602 --> 02:41:59.084]  I might write a book that's just humor, with nothing in it about the New World Order.
[02:41:59.605 --> 02:42:01.586]  Then folks will come find my serious work.
[02:42:01.606 --> 02:42:07.471]  You know, all of us need to express our humanity, make art, not just be into fighting the fellow reserve.
[02:42:07.671 --> 02:42:08.511]  We need to do that too.
[02:42:09.112 --> 02:42:14.095]  But we need to be balanced, we need to be fun, we need to be the true liberals of culture.
[02:42:14.396 --> 02:42:17.538]  The true Americana that the world loved and wanted to come here to be part of.
[02:42:18.991 --> 02:42:21.273]  Call it paleo-conservative, call it libertarian, whatever you want to call it.
[02:42:22.575 --> 02:42:23.335]  Live and let live.
[02:42:23.676 --> 02:42:24.236]  Tolerant.
[02:42:24.316 --> 02:42:26.358]  But I don't have to adopt your way of living.
[02:42:26.759 --> 02:42:28.020]  I'm not going to be conquered by you.
[02:42:28.360 --> 02:42:42.194]  Whether you're some super right-wing group that wants women to wear skirts down to their feet, or some radical Muslim group that wants to mutilate women and put bags on their heads, or whether you be some other weird cult or some liberal PC group that wants to teach five-year-olds how to wear dresses.
[02:42:43.646 --> 02:42:47.453]  These are all just unhappy cults pushing their agenda on those of us, the producers.
[02:42:47.494 --> 02:42:51.802]  It's time for us to stand up and shrug this off our shoulders and to be proud.
[02:42:52.796 --> 02:42:53.977]  That we're building a new culture.
[02:42:54.497 --> 02:42:55.878]  The globalists don't want you to have a culture.
[02:42:55.898 --> 02:42:59.581]  They want you to just have no culture, be afraid, watch TV, and let them program you.
[02:43:00.002 --> 02:43:01.163]  I'm saying be your culture.
[02:43:01.463 --> 02:43:02.083]  Be yourself.
[02:43:02.123 --> 02:43:04.305]  Really produce what comes from your heart.
[02:43:04.665 --> 02:43:05.266]  Produce art.
[02:43:05.606 --> 02:43:06.287]  Produce literature.
[02:43:06.607 --> 02:43:07.087]  Stand up.
[02:43:07.147 --> 02:43:07.808]  Believe in yourself.
[02:43:08.108 --> 02:43:10.069]  Don't let Madison Avenue tell you you're junk.
[02:43:10.650 --> 02:43:14.433]  They always make you feel inadequate, then they sell you their solution that will make you adequate.
[02:43:16.451 --> 02:43:22.634]  And again, that just ties back into this point that we're supposed to be losers, we're supposed to be underground, we're supposed to not be successful.
[02:43:24.615 --> 02:43:37.641]  I cannot tell you, in my 20 years on air, 21 years in just a few months, in April coming up, 21 years, I cannot tell you the success I've had, the people we've touched because of you spreading the word, and others.
[02:43:38.401 --> 02:43:45.265]  And now it's just reached a crescendo level where so many incredible, enlightened people that
[02:43:46.283 --> 02:43:56.907]  They are involved in so many good causes, but haven't gone to the next level of really being public about what they truly believe, because they know the public's been dumbed down into a control paradigm.
[02:43:57.367 --> 02:44:01.929]  Well, the answer is fighting back against that paradigm and just saying, I don't care if a bunch of people don't understand it.
[02:44:02.289 --> 02:44:05.510]  I don't care if a bunch of people get confused by it.
[02:44:06.290 --> 02:44:11.352]  I'm not going to be bullied anymore, and I'm going to put out complex info to raise the dialogue.
[02:44:11.592 --> 02:44:15.374]  The globalists admit, they've had a great frontline piece on this years ago, about a feedback loop.
[02:44:16.516 --> 02:44:19.859]  Where they put garbage out on purpose to dumb the debate down.
[02:44:19.899 --> 02:44:22.141]  It's not we're dumb, so they dumb the debate down.
[02:44:22.441 --> 02:44:23.302]  Now we've reached that level.
[02:44:23.482 --> 02:44:24.723]  Mission accomplished to a certain extent.
[02:44:24.923 --> 02:44:26.204]  We've hit the bottom, now let's go back up.
[02:44:26.444 --> 02:44:29.447]  But before it was dumb the message down to dumb you down.
[02:44:29.947 --> 02:44:31.128]  The message is the medium.
[02:44:32.489 --> 02:44:33.931]  Versus the medium is the message.
[02:44:33.991 --> 02:44:37.754]  It's both, but they dumb it down to make you dumb until you accept it.
[02:44:38.014 --> 02:44:39.055]  Until you're immersed in it.
[02:44:39.415 --> 02:44:40.816]  As a weapon against your free will.
[02:44:42.518 --> 02:44:44.219]  So all the big Hollywood stars out there,
[02:44:45.322 --> 02:44:48.883]  There are true classical liberals in the Thomas Jefferson vein, in the trailblazing vein.
[02:44:50.243 --> 02:44:51.064]  You need to go public.
[02:44:51.924 --> 02:44:58.446]  And if you want to do it in a safe space, you know, to use that term, in a taped interview, or have somebody else do it, or whatever, it's time.
[02:44:58.466 --> 02:45:02.847]  I mean, I'm just shooting this here at my cousin's condo, you know, with he and his wife.
[02:45:03.247 --> 02:45:04.627]  We're not doing this at some big, fancy production.
[02:45:04.907 --> 02:45:05.827]  Maybe it's off the cuff.
[02:45:05.847 --> 02:45:07.488]  Maybe you test the waters.
[02:45:07.548 --> 02:45:14.850]  But the amazing things you stand for, the eloquent statements you've made, those need to be heard by the world.
[02:45:15.939 --> 02:45:23.568]  I mean, the fact that somebody like Jeff Bridges is awake to the New World Order for years, and is a lister of my show, that's a big deal.
[02:45:23.928 --> 02:45:25.370]  And I haven't even reached out to Jeff Bridges yet.
[02:45:26.672 --> 02:45:28.774]  He was with some folks, they reached out the other night, I missed the call.
[02:45:29.415 --> 02:45:34.341]  But the point is, is that Jeff Bridges, I'm sure if he comes out against the Globalists, will get targeted.
[02:45:35.534 --> 02:45:36.794]  We're already all being targeted anyways.
[02:45:36.854 --> 02:45:38.435]  It's time for all those big names.
[02:45:38.875 --> 02:45:40.536]  People even bigger than Jeff Bridges.
[02:45:40.576 --> 02:45:41.916]  It's hard to believe there's anybody bigger than Jeff Bridges.
[02:45:42.076 --> 02:45:43.096]  There's certainly nobody cooler.
[02:45:43.556 --> 02:45:43.916]  The dude.
[02:45:43.936 --> 02:45:47.317]  You know, Starman, Tron, the whole nine yards.
[02:45:49.478 --> 02:45:51.759]  But there are people bigger when it comes to money.
[02:45:52.159 --> 02:45:52.959]  Bigger in music.
[02:45:53.419 --> 02:45:54.299]  As big as it gets.
[02:45:54.339 --> 02:45:55.200]  You think of the top.
[02:45:55.860 --> 02:45:56.280]  They're awake.
[02:45:57.220 --> 02:45:59.121]  And they just said, nope, we just can't handle it.
[02:45:59.141 --> 02:45:59.601]  We can't come on air.
[02:45:59.621 --> 02:46:00.741]  And that was years ago.
[02:46:01.902 --> 02:46:03.062]  And I understand all that.
[02:46:04.557 --> 02:46:06.422]  It's just this is so exciting to me when I'm talking about it.
[02:46:06.482 --> 02:46:07.264]  It's even cold in here.
[02:46:07.285 --> 02:46:11.095]  I started sweating because this is so epic what's going on in this world.
[02:46:11.737 --> 02:46:12.218]  It's so huge.
[02:46:13.729 --> 02:46:15.630]  And we're going to lose our future.
[02:46:15.650 --> 02:46:16.630]  We're going to lose our souls.
[02:46:16.650 --> 02:46:17.530]  We're going to lose our humanity.
[02:46:17.550 --> 02:46:24.573]  We're going to lose it all if we don't say no to this fraudulent system and the tyranny that is the controlled left, the controlled right.
[02:46:25.593 --> 02:46:26.713]  And so we are the winners.
[02:46:26.754 --> 02:46:29.054]  The Liberty Movement is popular.
[02:46:29.414 --> 02:46:31.075]  It's surging.
[02:46:31.455 --> 02:46:34.076]  That's why they've got all these subliminal messages targeting me in the media and others.
[02:46:34.456 --> 02:46:37.617]  It's why they're doing all these hit pieces and misrepresenting what I and others say.
[02:46:38.458 --> 02:46:39.298]  It's because they're scared.
[02:46:39.938 --> 02:46:41.700]  Well, the people serving the system.
[02:46:41.740 --> 02:46:43.922]  I talked to generals, top producers.
[02:46:44.623 --> 02:46:46.145]  Most of them don't want to serve the evil.
[02:46:46.425 --> 02:46:47.967]  They just don't have faith in humanity.
[02:46:48.387 --> 02:46:49.188]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:46:49.409 --> 02:46:51.251]  Humanity, on average, are followers.
[02:46:51.771 --> 02:46:53.093]  I'm talking to leaders out there.
[02:46:54.414 --> 02:47:07.677]  Whether you're a school principal, or a police chief, or a fire department chief, or deputy chief, or a doctor, a psychologist, people we think of as leaders, a preacher, a pastor, buck this corporate down destruction of society.
[02:47:07.737 --> 02:47:08.878]  Say no, be yourself.
[02:47:09.078 --> 02:47:12.358]  Don't follow what I say, because what I'm saying is follow your common sense.
[02:47:14.019 --> 02:47:16.660]  There's just so many amazing people that are awake.
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:20.741]  And then I think about when I was on a plane years ago flying to be on The View.
[02:47:21.121 --> 02:47:21.901]  I'll say this in closing.
[02:47:22.970 --> 02:47:25.772]  In first class, I'm sitting there, I'm explaining why I'm in first class.
[02:47:26.312 --> 02:47:28.534]  It's a little cultural Marxist thing and I shouldn't be in first class.
[02:47:28.554 --> 02:47:33.918]  The point is to be on the view, and there's the head, he knew who I was, sitting right beside me.
[02:47:35.039 --> 02:47:38.621]  In first class, the head of one of the major banks, one of the biggest, top five.
[02:47:39.402 --> 02:47:40.603]  And I'm like, is this who I think it is?
[02:47:42.124 --> 02:47:45.186]  And then he figures out who I am, and we have like an hour discussion.
[02:47:45.206 --> 02:47:47.948]  It was a three hour flight to New York, but we only really talked the last hour.
[02:47:49.537 --> 02:47:53.699]  And I've told the story many times, but just to paraphrase it, he just said, you don't get it.
[02:47:53.759 --> 02:47:55.160]  Humanity does evolve.
[02:47:55.220 --> 02:47:58.002]  You think they'll evolve and adapt and overcome what we're doing to them.
[02:47:58.542 --> 02:47:59.423]  People said, well, say his name.
[02:47:59.443 --> 02:48:00.503]  And we said, this is incompetence.
[02:48:00.523 --> 02:48:01.164]  So I can't break that.
[02:48:01.944 --> 02:48:02.585]  It's a journalism 101.
[02:48:04.326 --> 02:48:07.167]  He said, humanity will adapt to being enslaved.
[02:48:09.208 --> 02:48:09.709]  You don't get it.
[02:48:09.769 --> 02:48:11.109]  We slowly enslave you.
[02:48:11.270 --> 02:48:12.170]  That's why we do it slow.
[02:48:12.410 --> 02:48:14.651]  So you adapt and learn to submit to that.
[02:48:14.691 --> 02:48:15.332]  And then you love it.
[02:48:17.071 --> 02:48:20.014]  And he said the corporations are going to govern the planet and we know how to do it best.
[02:48:21.395 --> 02:48:24.999]  And he was cynical and he had his jacket suit on perfectly like it was a mannequin.
[02:48:25.339 --> 02:48:32.085]  He got up, put on his perfect, he was like a robot, and just looked at me disdainfully and laughed as he walked off that plane in front of me.
[02:48:34.387 --> 02:48:35.649]  And that's who those people are.
[02:48:36.229 --> 02:48:37.811]  They don't have faith in humanity while I do.
[02:48:39.002 --> 02:48:44.848]  But beyond that, there are people who could have joined that evil banker and been manipulative and been more powerful than him, but they had humanity and they didn't.
[02:48:45.229 --> 02:48:45.969]  Because you're humble.
[02:48:46.030 --> 02:48:47.051]  You don't want to dominate.
[02:48:47.071 --> 02:48:48.172]  I understand that.
[02:48:48.752 --> 02:48:50.214]  But you've got to get the bully off of you.
[02:48:50.474 --> 02:48:52.056]  You've got to get the bully off the little guys, too.
[02:48:52.476 --> 02:48:57.362]  You've got to stand up to these guys because you've got the power, you've got the light in the dark of the night.
[02:48:57.662 --> 02:48:58.423]  We've all got to do it.
[02:48:59.403 --> 02:49:03.627]  General public, movie stars, politicians, all of you, we gotta transcend.
[02:49:04.267 --> 02:49:04.888]  That's my rant.
[02:49:05.148 --> 02:49:06.369]  This is how we can defeat the globalists.
[02:49:06.409 --> 02:49:07.250]  Take over the culture.
[02:49:07.310 --> 02:49:08.171]  We are the culture.
[02:49:08.471 --> 02:49:09.472]  Liberty is the culture.
[02:49:09.692 --> 02:49:10.693]  Our roots are still here.
[02:49:10.993 --> 02:49:12.094]  They can spring back up.
[02:49:12.554 --> 02:49:14.416]  They may have cut this tree down, but it's growing back.
[02:49:15.477 --> 02:49:16.658]  It's growing back right in front of us.
[02:49:16.718 --> 02:49:17.318]  Let's water it.
[02:49:17.338 --> 02:49:17.979]  Let's take care of it.
[02:49:18.019 --> 02:49:18.519]  We can do it.
[02:49:19.620 --> 02:49:20.941]  Look at what we're the alternative to.
[02:49:21.082 --> 02:49:21.862]  This New World Order.
[02:49:21.942 --> 02:49:23.223]  Look how crappy it is.
[02:49:23.584 --> 02:49:24.705]  Look at what it has to offer.
[02:49:25.441 --> 02:49:26.842]  Look at the politicians falling apart.
[02:49:27.022 --> 02:49:27.783]  Look at both parties.
[02:49:27.823 --> 02:49:28.724]  Look at the global elite.
[02:49:28.904 --> 02:49:29.565]  They're a joke.
[02:49:31.226 --> 02:49:33.088]  They're only strong because we've laid down.
[02:49:33.909 --> 02:49:36.911]  It's time to awaken and come out of the coma.
[02:49:37.252 --> 02:49:41.075]  It's time for humanity to rise to the stars and beyond.
[02:49:43.504 --> 02:49:44.044]  Exactly right.
[02:49:44.084 --> 02:49:45.806]  That's what we've been talking about, isn't it, Anthony?
[02:49:45.846 --> 02:49:52.510]  It's interesting that you both chose the same thing to talk about today, but of course we can see this happening every day in the daily news.
[02:49:52.870 --> 02:50:13.124]  And I've talked about how this is leveling of the culture, destroying the national borders so these guys can impose a multinational corporate global governance on us through these mechanisms of fines and other bureaucratic agencies that will be able to assess things in different countries.
[02:50:13.904 --> 02:50:20.526]  It is amazing that we were just speaking about that exact topic and then he comes in and he says he has a special report and it's it's the same thing.
[02:50:21.146 --> 02:50:25.427]  The truth is we can rise up as the human spirit and we can defeat all of it.
[02:50:25.547 --> 02:50:27.127]  It is a cultural attack.
[02:50:27.267 --> 02:50:29.588]  It is a mental attack.
[02:50:29.748 --> 02:50:35.369]  It is an ideological attack at the deepest levels because it's not just about the main issues like we were talking about.
[02:50:35.429 --> 02:50:37.870]  It's not like just about Border Patrol.
[02:50:38.590 --> 02:50:42.134]  Issues and immigration and all that kind of stuff just about the financial issues.
[02:50:42.194 --> 02:50:42.294]  No.
[02:50:42.354 --> 02:50:54.807]  No, it's a systematic attack on the human Consciousness to push us down and to make us think we're weak and worth nothing when we are worth so much We can defeat all of this at the same time if we just realize it exactly stay with us.
[02:50:54.827 --> 02:50:58.751]  We'll be right back I'm David Knight and Anthony Gucciardi is here in studio with me.
[02:50:58.771 --> 02:50:59.612]  We'll be right back
[02:51:09.485 --> 02:51:11.887]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[02:51:12.087 --> 02:51:13.027]  Get back to nature.

[02:51:42.204 --> 02:51:43.485]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[02:52:08.581 --> 02:52:09.462]  Hey, Berky Guy here.
[02:52:09.542 --> 02:52:11.244]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[02:52:11.364 --> 02:52:13.047]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[02:52:13.147 --> 02:52:14.969]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?
[02:52:15.089 --> 02:52:20.976]  The Berky Guy is here to help you remove these and other potential contaminants from your water, thus helping you drink clean, purified water.

[02:52:24.741 --> 02:52:26.643]  Don't go another moment without Berkey System.

[02:52:29.805 --> 02:52:34.329]  Join them by visiting GoBerkey.com or call me, the Berkey Guy, at 877-886-3653.
[02:52:34.369 --> 02:52:36.230]  That's 877-886-3653.
[02:52:38.172 --> 02:52:46.879]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[02:52:47.079 --> 02:52:48.020]  Silver Lungs.

[02:52:55.467 --> 02:53:01.393]  This pioneering method also preserves the original particle sizes and delivers your silver solution directly into the bloodstream.
[02:53:01.513 --> 02:53:05.577]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and Lung Delivery System at SilverLungs.com.
[02:53:05.637 --> 02:53:07.359]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[02:53:10.287 --> 02:53:14.508]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[02:53:14.928 --> 02:53:18.668]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[02:53:19.209 --> 02:53:20.449]  We typically do the same thing.
[02:53:20.589 --> 02:53:23.129]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[02:53:23.609 --> 02:53:25.230]  But have you considered heat storage?
[02:53:25.830 --> 02:53:27.610]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[02:53:28.030 --> 02:53:29.710]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[02:53:30.310 --> 02:53:31.691]  How will I keep my family warm?
[02:53:31.951 --> 02:53:34.411]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[02:53:34.451 --> 02:53:38.512]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[02:53:39.332 --> 02:53:40.053]  Another concern?
[02:53:40.453 --> 02:53:44.116]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[02:53:44.436 --> 02:53:46.678]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[02:53:47.018 --> 02:53:50.221]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[02:53:51.002 --> 02:53:53.444]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[02:53:53.804 --> 02:53:57.767]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[02:53:58.448 --> 02:53:59.789]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[02:54:00.469 --> 02:54:01.750]  FortressClothing.com.
[02:54:02.111 --> 02:54:03.452]  You'll never be cold again.
[02:54:25.225 --> 02:54:26.426]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:26.446 --> 02:54:28.588]  I'm David Knight, and joining me is Anthony Gucciardi.
[02:54:28.648 --> 02:54:37.417]  We've been talking about how ideas are forced upon us, and of course, Alex Jones essentially had the same idea.
[02:54:37.457 --> 02:54:38.979]  We all see this happening everywhere.
[02:54:38.999 --> 02:54:44.845]  We're going to talk to you about it from another angle, and that is from The Onion's parody angle in just a moment.
[02:54:44.885 --> 02:54:45.405]  Before I do...
[02:54:46.266 --> 02:54:48.567]  I want to tell you about the specials that we've got.
[02:54:48.628 --> 02:54:50.469]  One that's going to be just this weekend.
[02:54:51.029 --> 02:54:53.411]  Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[02:54:53.431 --> 02:54:55.052]  20% off at Infowarslife.com.
[02:54:55.092 --> 02:54:56.112]  Of course, winter is coming.
[02:54:56.172 --> 02:55:01.996]  Now is a good time to get D3 packed into a powerful 2,000 IUs per single dose.
[02:55:02.056 --> 02:55:03.317]  And of course, it's in a liquid form.
[02:55:03.617 --> 02:55:05.178]  Highly bioavailable.
[02:55:05.638 --> 02:55:07.879]  It's completely free of GMOs, toxins, additives.
[02:55:08.299 --> 02:55:12.240]  It's an ultra-clean lab-tested source of vitamin D3.

[02:55:18.041 --> 02:55:20.622]  Nine out of ten people are infested with harmful organisms.
[02:55:20.662 --> 02:55:26.123]  Living Defense uses wild-crafted and organic herbs to help naturally cleanse harmful organisms from your body.
[02:55:26.203 --> 02:55:27.223]  This is a new product.
[02:55:27.583 --> 02:55:32.124]  We just got it out this week in our limited first run, so it's not going to last very long.
[02:55:32.164 --> 02:55:34.025]  We expect to sell out this week.
[02:55:34.846 --> 02:55:36.050]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:55:36.070 --> 02:55:37.936]  You can find Living Defense.
[02:55:37.976 --> 02:55:40.806]  And again, get 20% off of Wintersun Vitamin D3.
[02:55:42.225 --> 02:55:43.626]  Anthony, everybody is looking at this.
[02:55:43.666 --> 02:55:48.328]  We see the Hungarian Prime Minister is saying what's going on in Hungary.
[02:55:48.368 --> 02:55:49.789]  Says, who gave the order?
[02:55:49.869 --> 02:55:53.310]  Who has the authority to open up our borders and then to take them down?
[02:55:53.370 --> 02:55:57.332]  This is a pre-planned takedown, a treasonous conspiracy.
[02:55:57.392 --> 02:56:00.574]  And he names George Soros, who happens to also be Hungarian.
[02:56:00.654 --> 02:56:03.355]  Yeah, he knows where this guy is coming from, okay?
[02:56:03.915 --> 02:56:04.676]  Alex Jones sees it.
[02:56:04.696 --> 02:56:05.276]  You see it.
[02:56:05.316 --> 02:56:05.896]  You're talking about it.
[02:56:05.916 --> 02:56:06.897]  I'm seeing it, talking about it.
[02:56:06.917 --> 02:56:07.697]  Everybody's talking about this.
[02:56:07.737 --> 02:56:09.458]  And, of course, The Onion is talking about it.
[02:56:10.138 --> 02:56:13.800]  College encourages lively exchange of idea.
[02:56:14.180 --> 02:56:14.600]  Singular.
[02:56:14.621 --> 02:56:18.643]  Students and faculty are invited to freely express a single viewpoint.
[02:56:19.383 --> 02:56:23.165]  As I say, such dialogue is essential to the college's academic mission.
[02:56:23.725 --> 02:56:29.388]  The university president confirmed Monday that school encourages a lively exchange of one idea.
[02:56:29.468 --> 02:56:32.590]  Quote, as an institution of higher learning, we recognize it's inevitable
[02:56:32.910 --> 02:56:33.210]  We're good.
[02:56:49.558 --> 02:56:50.840]  That's basically it.
[02:56:51.201 --> 02:57:00.072]  Whether you're talking about the weather or anything else, they have a consensus and you're welcome to join along or you will be shut up.
[02:57:00.173 --> 02:57:04.278]  And unfortunately, that is the spot on satire from The Onion.
[02:57:04.498 --> 02:57:06.020]  It might as well be a CNN article.
[02:57:07.410 --> 02:57:09.112]  You could go to the University of Missouri, huh?
[02:57:09.852 --> 02:57:23.984]  No, really, but I would also say that the number one reason all that happens, the reason that we all homogenize into the one idea besides the establishment system, is because people are afraid of details.
[02:57:24.445 --> 02:57:26.667]  They just cannot handle details.
[02:57:27.047 --> 02:57:29.289]  That's why left vs. right is so pervasive.
[02:57:29.789 --> 02:57:32.392]  Unfortunately, people have been brought up
[02:57:33.032 --> 02:57:35.514]  A large percentage of the population through the establishment system.
[02:57:35.575 --> 02:57:36.555]  I'm not judging people.
[02:57:36.636 --> 02:57:38.717]  It's not, you know, that they're idiots.
[02:57:38.778 --> 02:57:39.899]  They've been brought up like this.
[02:57:40.539 --> 02:57:44.463]  To really just pick red or blue or one or two.
[02:57:44.523 --> 02:57:45.484]  There's no in-between.
[02:57:45.544 --> 02:57:49.267]  There's no sliding scale of information or options or ideas.
[02:57:49.628 --> 02:57:55.013]  And the universities have, they're like mass manufacturers of single viewpoints.
[02:57:55.473 --> 02:57:58.237]  It's the antithesis of what used to be a liberal education.
[02:57:58.337 --> 02:57:58.757]  Exactly.
[02:57:58.777 --> 02:58:04.224]  Give you the tools of learning, help you to make decisions, put up multiple viewpoints, challenge each other.
[02:58:04.284 --> 02:58:05.465]  No, they want a single viewpoint.
[02:58:05.705 --> 02:58:07.427]  Sometimes they offer us a false dichotomy.
[02:58:07.468 --> 02:58:09.650]  They say, well, it's either this or it's either that.
[02:58:09.850 --> 02:58:11.392]  As a banana or a rotting apple.
[02:58:11.512 --> 02:58:11.893]  Exactly.
[02:58:12.193 --> 02:58:13.113]  But that's not the case.
[02:58:13.153 --> 02:58:17.115]  But now what they're doing increasingly is just pushing out a single viewpoint.
[02:58:17.155 --> 02:58:19.776]  You saw that cartoon up there, Nico found.
[02:58:20.056 --> 02:58:24.337]  The guy comes back to the college and hands him a piece of paper, says, this is my degree.
[02:58:24.897 --> 02:58:26.138]  I want my money back.
[02:58:26.198 --> 02:58:27.038]  It's not working.
[02:58:27.098 --> 02:58:29.939]  That's right, because it wasn't designed to make you money.
[02:58:30.259 --> 02:58:32.100]  It wasn't designed to make you a free thinker.
[02:58:32.600 --> 02:58:38.501]  They want to shut down any free thought, any challenging of the accepted consensus.
[02:58:38.861 --> 02:58:39.922]  Stay back when we return.
[02:58:39.982 --> 02:58:40.602]  Thank you, Anthony.
[02:58:40.902 --> 02:58:48.723]  When we return, I'm going to talk about the established consensus and what they're about to do come the end of this month for global governments.
[02:58:49.003 --> 02:58:49.624]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:50.264 --> 02:58:51.604]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:59:03.079 --> 02:59:11.104]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:11.344 --> 02:59:16.367]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:59:37.750 --> 02:59:40.911]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:59:41.031 --> 02:59:44.233]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:59:44.513 --> 02:59:46.313]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:59:46.494 --> 02:59:48.354]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.

[03:00:10.938 --> 03:00:16.003]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:16.343 --> 03:00:18.626]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:24.915 --> 03:00:26.316]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:26.376 --> 03:00:27.337]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:00:27.357 --> 03:00:29.218]  We're going to be taking your calls later in the hour.
[03:00:29.918 --> 03:00:34.721]  This segment I'd like to go over is just some of the miscellaneous news that we've seen here that's pretty big.
[03:00:34.761 --> 03:00:38.844]  Actually, you know, this was something that came that was up on our site since yesterday.
[03:00:38.904 --> 03:00:39.805]  Glass-Steagall
[03:00:40.485 --> 03:00:41.766]  Takes center stage in 2016.
[03:00:41.806 --> 03:00:44.928]  That sounds kind of wonky, doesn't it?
[03:00:44.968 --> 03:00:45.668]  Glass-Steagall.
[03:00:45.688 --> 03:00:53.493]  Well, actually, you may have heard a lot of people talking about this, but it isn't really a wonky policy issue.
[03:00:53.553 --> 03:00:54.574]  No, they put that in in 1933.
[03:00:54.654 --> 03:00:55.694]  They removed it in the year 2000.
[03:00:58.436 --> 03:01:01.978]  And basically, as The Hill describes it, I think it's a very succinct description of it.
[03:01:01.998 --> 03:01:06.260]  They say it's a firewall between investment and commercial banking.
[03:01:06.900 --> 03:01:07.320]  Exactly.
[03:01:07.701 --> 03:01:13.803]  See, when they had the crash, they said, well, we had all these runs on banks, so we want people to understand that their money is going to be secure in the banks.
[03:01:14.584 --> 03:01:17.565]  So we're going to let banks have federal deposit insurance.
[03:01:17.585 --> 03:01:20.387]  So the FDIC was created, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
[03:01:20.407 --> 03:01:23.948]  They were going to insure deposits up to, and now the limit is like $100,000.
[03:01:24.489 --> 03:01:26.730]  I don't know, probably didn't start out that high.
[03:01:27.390 --> 03:01:29.813]  But they insure your deposits up to a certain level.
[03:01:29.853 --> 03:01:33.037]  If you put more than that in one bank, you know that you're rich.
[03:01:33.537 --> 03:01:38.543]  But you also know that you're putting some risk in that, that it's not insured.
[03:01:38.623 --> 03:01:41.347]  Now, in exchange for that insurance, it's offered from the federal government.
[03:01:41.997 --> 03:01:50.462]  What they're going to do is they, as part of Glass-Steagall, they said, we're not going to let the banks get involved in risky investments.
[03:01:50.502 --> 03:01:52.403]  In other words, we're going to keep them out of Wall Street.
[03:01:52.423 --> 03:01:55.925]  We're going to not let them buy stock on margin.
[03:01:56.486 --> 03:02:00.188]  They could go down, they could put a very little amount, just a portion of the price of stock
[03:02:00.888 --> 03:02:02.429]  Buy it on credit, if you will.
[03:02:02.469 --> 03:02:03.710]  They call that margin buying.
[03:02:04.090 --> 03:02:07.452]  So they could buy it with just a little bit down, and they could leverage that.
[03:02:07.792 --> 03:02:15.597]  See, the banks are already leveraging a lot of money because they're able to essentially create money by the money that they borrow from the Federal Reserve and then loan it back out on deposit.
[03:02:15.617 --> 03:02:17.158]  So, okay, that's enough.
[03:02:17.198 --> 03:02:18.239]  You guys can do that.
[03:02:18.359 --> 03:02:19.339]  That's going to be your business.
[03:02:19.359 --> 03:02:20.840]  You're going to be very conservative.
[03:02:21.701 --> 03:02:27.905]  People are going to know that this stuff is safe because we're going to keep you conservatively invested and we're going to ensure their deposits and everything.
[03:02:27.925 --> 03:02:29.266]  But then they took all that off in the year 2000.
[03:02:31.050 --> 03:02:33.211]  And that was while the Clintons were still there, remember?
[03:02:33.751 --> 03:02:36.573]  And how did all these banks get so big to fail?
[03:02:37.193 --> 03:02:38.514]  Well, that was the Clintons again.
[03:02:38.534 --> 03:02:42.055]  Okay, and understand I'm not giving the Republicans a free pass on this.
[03:02:42.536 --> 03:02:43.656]  They were part of this as well.
[03:02:44.277 --> 03:02:49.059]  And George Bush and the Republicans ran through the bailouts for the banks when it all came crashing down.
[03:02:49.099 --> 03:02:50.620]  But how did they build this bubble?
[03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:53.181]  How did the banks get too big to fail?
[03:02:53.822 --> 03:03:16.116]  As I pointed out before, the essential merger that began this runaway consolidation that eventually gave us a handful, half-dozen, six or seven banks that were too big to fail, that had to be bailed out, they told us, and again, they didn't have to be bailed out, but the ones that had so much power that they could get the government to bail them out and tell us lies about it, that all began under the Clinton administration.
[03:03:16.756 --> 03:03:19.257]  It began in North Carolina, actually.
[03:03:19.277 --> 03:03:24.520]  It was Bank of America moved their headquarters to North Carolina when they did a nation's bank merger.
[03:03:24.560 --> 03:03:26.821]  And at the time, everybody said, that'll never get approved.
[03:03:26.861 --> 03:03:28.322]  Those two banks are too big.
[03:03:29.042 --> 03:03:33.064]  It's going to create a rush of consolidation that we don't want to have in this country.
[03:03:33.834 --> 03:03:34.675]  But it got approved.
[03:03:34.856 --> 03:03:41.386]  And it got approved, I believe, because of people who were highly placed in the Clinton administration from North Carolina, people like Erskine Bowles.
[03:03:42.087 --> 03:03:45.933]  He had a lot of connections with the banking industry in Charlotte and so forth.
[03:03:45.993 --> 03:03:47.315]  Anyway, for whatever reason...
[03:03:48.015 --> 03:03:48.615]  Whatever reason.
[03:03:48.655 --> 03:03:51.597]  Maybe, you know, influence or money passed hands.
[03:03:51.617 --> 03:03:52.917]  We're talking the Clintons here, okay?
[03:03:54.118 --> 03:03:59.220]  Nevertheless, they consolidated, they approved that merger, and it was off to the races.
[03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:04.483]  And then all the big banks started buying each other, and smaller banks, and turned into the too big to fail.
[03:04:05.303 --> 03:04:07.665]  Now, the question is, what are they going to do about this?
[03:04:07.685 --> 03:04:11.268]  A lot of people have said, look, we need to put this back in place.
[03:04:11.328 --> 03:04:13.770]  We need to have a more sound financial system.
[03:04:14.730 --> 03:04:24.278]  Hillary Clinton is feeling the heat because she has both of her opponents on the Democrat side, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley, are both saying we need to put this back in.
[03:04:24.298 --> 03:04:32.744]  They're echoing Elizabeth Warren, saying this is an unacceptable risk that we're allowing the banks to take with people's money, which means that we're then going to have to
[03:04:34.045 --> 03:04:34.685]  Bail them out.
[03:04:34.745 --> 03:04:40.628]  We're going to let them privatize the profits and then they're going to call on us to socialize the losses.
[03:04:40.988 --> 03:04:42.348]  Pass the losses on to everybody else.
[03:04:42.669 --> 03:04:52.913]  On the Republican side, interestingly enough, the only candidate on the Republican side who has come out in terms of supporting putting Glass-Steagall back in place is Mike Huckabee.
[03:04:53.533 --> 03:04:54.573]  Credit where credit's due.
[03:04:54.593 --> 03:04:57.215]  I'm not a Huckabee supporter, but he got that one right.
[03:04:57.515 --> 03:04:58.355]  We're going to be right back.
[03:04:58.595 --> 03:04:59.836]  We're going to take some of your calls.
[03:05:00.176 --> 03:05:00.556]  Stay with us.
[03:05:09.779 --> 03:05:12.120]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[03:05:12.300 --> 03:05:16.001]  Rand Paul calls Obama an idiot on foreign policy.
[03:05:16.021 --> 03:05:21.063]  What kind of idiot sends four people to war in a campaign stop in Iowa yesterday?
[03:05:21.183 --> 03:05:28.865]  Senator Rand Paul had some choice words for the president, labeling him an idiot over his handling of the situation in Syria.
[03:05:28.985 --> 03:05:29.926]  Bravo, Rand Paul.
[03:05:30.106 --> 03:05:30.426]  Bravo.
[03:05:30.686 --> 03:05:36.990]  Speaking to the crowd on military and foreign policy, Paul asks, what kind of idiot sends four people to war?
[03:05:37.130 --> 03:05:43.254]  The senator was referring to Obama's monumental fail in attempting to train Syrian rebels to fight ISIS.
[03:05:43.374 --> 03:05:53.441]  The program cost an estimated $500 million, but was aborted as it was revealed that just four or five trainers remained from an initial 54.
[03:05:54.302 --> 03:05:57.764]  If you go to war, you don't go with underwhelming force, you go to war with
[03:05:58.004 --> 03:06:00.646]  Overwhelming force, Paul further explained.
[03:06:00.766 --> 03:06:05.508]  Paul also spoke on arming the rebels, calling it crazy foolish to feed arms to people who ate us.

[03:08:38.993 --> 03:08:44.456]  800-259-9231 if you'd like to comment on the news, what we've been talking about today.
[03:08:44.476 --> 03:08:51.761]  And of course, with Anthony Gucciardi and with Alex Jones' special report, we've been talking about how a
[03:08:52.762 --> 03:08:56.603]  Consensus is forced upon us in so many different ways.
[03:08:57.063 --> 03:09:00.144]  There was a great parody article that we mentioned from The Onion.
[03:09:00.205 --> 03:09:03.406]  College encourages lively exchange of idea.
[03:09:04.226 --> 03:09:07.667]  Students, faculty invited to freely express a single viewpoint.
[03:09:08.047 --> 03:09:11.748]  You're welcome to join us if you're going to be part of the consensus.
[03:09:12.148 --> 03:09:13.189]  See, that's what it's become.
[03:09:14.105 --> 03:09:21.754]  The kind of intolerance, and as we look at what's coming up at the end of this month, this climate meeting in Paris, okay?
[03:09:22.675 --> 03:09:26.479]  We need to understand what the bigger picture is.
[03:09:26.519 --> 03:09:33.327]  And of course the bigger picture is that it's going to be used to establish a global governance mechanism, just like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:09:33.347 --> 03:09:34.609]  We need to understand that just like
[03:09:35.149 --> 03:09:36.390]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:09:36.410 --> 03:09:40.811]  This is something that is being presented to us by multinational corporations.
[03:09:40.891 --> 03:09:45.753]  People that are going to make a lot of money when you pay them for the privilege of flipping on your light switch.
[03:09:45.813 --> 03:09:50.315]  You're going to pay a tax to Al Gore or some of the other carbon billionaires.
[03:09:51.226 --> 03:09:55.188]  But you're also going to be creating a global governance mechanism.
[03:09:55.228 --> 03:09:56.729]  That's also going to be a part of it.
[03:09:57.409 --> 03:09:59.310]  Look at this article that came out yesterday.
[03:09:59.390 --> 03:10:03.152]  Alex mentioned it yesterday, and it's worth going back and taking a look at this again.
[03:10:03.172 --> 03:10:07.295]  A Rasmussen poll said little support for punishing global warming foes.
[03:10:07.335 --> 03:10:11.397]  Well, yes, it is a small minority, you might say, a third of the people.
[03:10:11.997 --> 03:10:20.866]  But I still think that that is pretty amazing, that a third of the people out there, they say 68% would not support it, but that would mean 32% would.
[03:10:21.848 --> 03:10:22.548]  68% of likely U.S.
[03:10:22.588 --> 03:10:30.797]  voters oppose the government investigating and prosecuting scientists and others, including major corporations who question global warming.
[03:10:31.057 --> 03:10:32.018]  Let me repeat that to you.
[03:10:33.018 --> 03:10:34.779]  Thirty-two percent, I'll put it the other way around.
[03:10:35.299 --> 03:10:48.186]  Thirty-two percent of people, one-third of the people, want the government to investigate and prosecute anybody that dissents on the consensus opinion about global warming and its causes.
[03:10:49.427 --> 03:10:50.248]  Does that frighten you?
[03:10:50.768 --> 03:10:51.988]  I mean, that should frighten you.
[03:10:52.569 --> 03:10:54.090]  That is not the scientific method.
[03:10:54.983 --> 03:10:56.705]  Scientific method is skeptical.
[03:10:57.065 --> 03:11:05.816]  Scientific method says we can look at the data, we can keep looking at the data, we will keep doing experiments, we will continue to revise this, because you know what?
[03:11:05.876 --> 03:11:09.640]  Over our history we have seen the consensus change many times, haven't we?
[03:11:10.621 --> 03:11:13.344]  Remember, you know, the discussion about
[03:11:14.241 --> 03:11:15.861]  Copernicus and Galileo and the Pope.
[03:11:16.762 --> 03:11:19.922]  Everybody always puts that in as, well, religion versus science.
[03:11:19.962 --> 03:11:21.883]  Well, it wasn't really that simple.
[03:11:22.743 --> 03:11:34.645]  The true story is, the bigger story, the more detailed story, is that they had come up with a model, a Ptolemaic model, that had all the planets and the Sun moving around the Earth.
[03:11:35.785 --> 03:11:38.186]  And they had actually used that for navigation.
[03:11:39.181 --> 03:12:01.254]  And one of the reasons why they were so slow to go over to a Sun-centered model was because, and to throw away this geocentric model, was because they were getting better results with that than they were with a model that had the Sun at the center and the planets revolving around it, as we have now seen and proven, okay?
[03:12:01.794 --> 03:12:04.056]  The reason they weren't getting very good results
[03:12:04.656 --> 03:12:06.637]  Was because they had circular orbits.
[03:12:07.157 --> 03:12:20.081]  And it wasn't until Kepler came along and said, let's try elliptical orbits, that they got something that mathematically predicted positions of planets so they could use it for navigation that actually gave them the correct answers.
[03:12:20.361 --> 03:12:22.842]  So the bottom line was, it wasn't totally irrational.
[03:12:22.862 --> 03:12:26.843]  It wasn't completely imposing religion on science.
[03:12:27.464 --> 03:12:34.086]  But the point being is that even when you've got something that is a model that seems to be working correctly, it can be completely wrong.
[03:12:34.929 --> 03:12:36.210]  You can have a very detailed model.
[03:12:36.250 --> 03:12:42.653]  We haven't even seen that kind of verification of these climate models because, of course, these climate models are so far out.
[03:12:42.673 --> 03:12:43.854]  50 years, 100 years.
[03:12:44.434 --> 03:12:47.916]  One of the reasons why meteorologists are so reluctant to buy into this.
[03:12:47.976 --> 03:13:00.823]  When we were at the American Meteorological Association here in Austin, when they were having their annual meeting here, Rob Jacobson and I went there and we saw all the scientists and they're worrying about how do they predict the weather one, two, three days in advance.
[03:13:01.564 --> 03:13:15.273]  They had all these different weather models that were not accurate, and they were looking at how they could constantly tweak these models, then test them, and then tweak them again, and keep going through this iterative process, trying to get something that was accurate.
[03:13:15.573 --> 03:13:21.958]  So when you come to them and you say, well, I've got a climate model that predicts everything for 50 years, or 100 years, or multiple centuries, or millennia,
[03:13:23.404 --> 03:13:24.585]  It's like, how do I verify this?
[03:13:24.625 --> 03:13:25.705]  Well, you can't verify it.
[03:13:25.725 --> 03:13:28.546]  So what they do is they sell it to you on the basis of consensus.
[03:13:28.586 --> 03:13:32.168]  They sell it to you on the basis of, believe me, because I'm an authority.
[03:13:32.648 --> 03:13:34.149]  And now they've gone beyond that.
[03:13:34.369 --> 03:13:39.031]  Now they want to shut down any skepticism by calling people deniers.
[03:13:40.651 --> 03:13:42.272]  They are not talking about science now.
[03:13:42.312 --> 03:13:43.432]  They're talking about religion.
[03:13:43.472 --> 03:13:45.253]  And understand how this is breaking down.
[03:13:45.313 --> 03:13:54.777]  As Rasmussen pointed this out, just over 1 in 4 Democrats, 27%, favored prosecuting those who didn't agree with them on global warming.
[03:13:55.797 --> 03:14:01.560]  They say, after all, only 24% of voters believe the scientific debate about global warming is over.
[03:14:02.830 --> 03:14:07.456]  And those who believe that it's over essentially want to prosecute you if you don't agree with them.
[03:14:08.036 --> 03:14:10.199]  You have to understand science is never over.
[03:14:10.759 --> 03:14:12.421]  Real science can stand the scrutiny.
[03:14:12.942 --> 03:14:14.123]  And it needs to be scrutinized.
[03:14:14.163 --> 03:14:19.990]  And if somebody comes to you and tells you that this is your last chance to do something.
[03:14:20.030 --> 03:14:21.032]  Today you have to buy this.
[03:14:21.092 --> 03:14:22.573]  I'm going to make you this deal on this car.
[03:14:23.459 --> 03:14:24.379]  But it's only for today.
[03:14:24.999 --> 03:14:26.540]  That price is going to be gone tomorrow.
[03:14:26.600 --> 03:14:35.521]  You know, when somebody starts doing a hard sell on you at the used car sales place, and they say, this is it, you know, this is the only thing you're going to get, you ought to be skeptical.
[03:14:35.861 --> 03:14:36.162]  Okay?
[03:14:36.242 --> 03:14:38.642]  And we've heard this time and time again.
[03:14:38.682 --> 03:14:46.924]  You know, but right now, along with this article from the New American, they say climate alarmists are demanding wartime austerity, rationing, and control.
[03:14:46.964 --> 03:14:47.764]  They're pushing this
[03:14:48.664 --> 03:14:53.669]  Creating a crisis because they want to usher in a global governing mechanism.
[03:14:54.469 --> 03:14:59.594]  A mechanism that will transfer wealth to the 1% of the 1% of the 1%.
[03:15:00.995 --> 03:15:06.400]  And will transfer our sovereignty to a multinational governance committee.
[03:15:06.440 --> 03:15:10.964]  The same thing that we're concerned about people who understand what's going on with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:15:11.284 --> 03:15:12.025]  Same mechanism.
[03:15:12.065 --> 03:15:12.846]  They're destroying
[03:15:13.366 --> 03:15:14.127]  We're good to go.
[03:15:28.905 --> 03:15:30.046]  It was linked on the Drudge Report.
[03:15:30.186 --> 03:15:35.231]  Every UN climate summit is hailed as a, quote, last chance to stop global warming before it's too late.
[03:15:35.452 --> 03:15:39.956]  You know, this may be our last chance to stop global governance before it's too late.
[03:15:40.016 --> 03:15:41.878]  We have to wake up to what's going on with this.
[03:15:42.338 --> 03:15:48.244]  And again, he points out that Paris, they're saying the next climate summit in Paris, which is going to be November 30th,
[03:15:49.025 --> 03:15:54.210]  Through December 13th, if I remember the dates correctly, may be the last effective opportunity.
[03:15:54.230 --> 03:15:58.874]  Well, he goes back and he says, hey, we had a last chance in Bonn in 2001.
[03:15:58.934 --> 03:16:01.576]  We had another last chance in Montreal in 2005.
[03:16:01.956 --> 03:16:03.357]  Another one in Bali in 2007.
[03:16:03.578 --> 03:16:09.423]  They said Bali could be the last chance to avoid the worst effects of global warming.
[03:16:09.783 --> 03:16:16.349]  Also in 2007, about that same conference, you had Philip Clapp, head of the Washington-based National Environmental Trust, said,
[03:16:16.829 --> 03:16:22.734]  The scientists are telling us this is the world's last shot at avoiding the worst consequences of global warming.
[03:16:23.475 --> 03:16:24.876]  Another last shot in Poland in 2008.
[03:16:25.877 --> 03:16:31.082]  The world will suicide if it cannot strike a strong climate pact, said Professor Flannery.
[03:16:31.523 --> 03:16:36.167]  2008, humanity is approaching the last chance to prevent catastrophic climate change.
[03:16:36.567 --> 03:16:38.249]  Another last chance that we missed.
[03:16:38.889 --> 03:16:40.851]  And Copenhagen in 2009.
[03:16:41.131 --> 03:16:48.557]  The world faces a final opportunity to agree to an adequate global response to climate change at a UN-led meeting in Copenhagen in December.
[03:16:49.118 --> 03:16:56.444]  And we were also told that by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon was preaching of catastrophic consequences if that was missed, that last chance.
[03:16:56.464 --> 03:17:03.610]  And we had another last chance in 2010 in Cancun, and another last chance in Durban 2011, and now we've got our last chance coming up.
[03:17:04.738 --> 03:17:04.998]  Really?
[03:17:05.559 --> 03:17:16.667]  You know, part of it is, as we've talked about, the recent NASA data talking about the Antarctic ice caps, and they said, yeah, we've had record melting in the Antarctic.
[03:17:17.507 --> 03:17:17.768]  Okay?
[03:17:18.208 --> 03:17:23.292]  But they've had a net increase in ice because there's so much ice down in the Antarctic.
[03:17:24.853 --> 03:17:32.161]  And the people still pushed back against NASA and said, no, what you're looking at is not technically ice, it's snow.
[03:17:32.181 --> 03:17:38.327]  And they said, no, there hasn't been, we can look at our weather records, there hasn't been any much snow down there.
[03:17:38.347 --> 03:17:39.728]  That is ice buildup.
[03:17:40.874 --> 03:17:44.938]  So you see, you can go back and forth, you can look at the data, and it's how do you interpret the data.
[03:17:44.998 --> 03:17:49.042]  And the data needs to be constantly re-evaluated, re-interpreted.
[03:17:49.302 --> 03:17:52.946]  These models need to be tested in the ways that we can test them.
[03:17:52.966 --> 03:17:55.428]  And of course, some of the tests that we've seen, you know, we were told...
[03:17:56.809 --> 03:18:16.235]  Back in the 1970s, I've got the Time Magazine articles telling us that we were going to be going into global cooling, we were going to run out of oil at the time, and of course, we should have had, according to Al Gore and his inconvenient truths that he was telling us, we weren't going to have an Antarctic or an Arctic ice cap.
[03:18:16.375 --> 03:18:19.516]  They were going to be gone by now, because we had missed our last chances.
[03:18:21.075 --> 03:18:28.400]  And now we're being told by some scientists that there is a cycle coming from the sun that's going to go into hibernation mode.
[03:18:28.441 --> 03:18:30.722]  And we're going to see a cooling effect.
[03:18:30.982 --> 03:18:34.845]  And when it's activity, which is not constant, folks, it cycles.
[03:18:35.565 --> 03:18:37.707]  And they can see this cycling that's going on.
[03:18:37.727 --> 03:18:39.528]  They say we're going to enter a hibernation mode around 2030.
[03:18:40.689 --> 03:18:45.815]  When that happens, it's not going to only be a cooling effect of less energy coming from the sun.
[03:18:45.835 --> 03:18:52.522]  They point out a dim sun doesn't deflect cosmic rays away from the Earth as efficiently as a bright sun.
[03:18:52.562 --> 03:18:58.969]  So, when these rays will enter our atmosphere, they will seed clouds, which will in turn cool our planet even more.
[03:18:59.229 --> 03:18:59.489]  I think so.
[03:19:13.169 --> 03:19:26.358]  The impact of climate-related extreme weather events is now driving home the reality of the climate crisis in a way that scientific predictions did not.
[03:19:26.838 --> 03:19:31.481]  Every night on the television news is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation.
[03:19:31.841 --> 03:19:34.783]  The number of extremely hot days has multiplied dramatically.
[03:19:34.923 --> 03:19:37.485]  It gets cold, we have floods, we don't have floods.
[03:19:37.585 --> 03:19:41.488]  Floods, mudslides, the deeper and longer droughts
[03:19:42.108 --> 03:19:50.237]  Rising sea levels from the melting ice, forest fires, and increasingly people are connecting those dots.
[03:19:50.878 --> 03:19:59.968]  And even if they don't use the phrase climate crisis or global warming, more and more people are feeling that this is going to have to be addressed.
[03:20:00.328 --> 03:20:03.849]  So damage has been done, and we have to understand that.
[03:20:03.869 --> 03:20:04.389]  Let's stop this.
[03:20:04.429 --> 03:20:05.869]  You know, that's what we see every time.
[03:20:05.889 --> 03:20:10.390]  You know, each side will say, hey, it's snowing, it's cold, or it's warm, so that preserves it.
[03:20:10.430 --> 03:20:11.470]  It's much more complicated.
[03:20:11.490 --> 03:20:15.791]  Two of our top priorities are providing quality food at a reasonable price and protecting your security.
[03:20:16.091 --> 03:20:24.073]  When you call 800-700-2184, we will never record your phone call and never ask for your personal information, like how much food you have stored or where you keep it.

[03:24:18.624 --> 03:24:22.846]  He's pounding down, loaded up and trucking.
[03:24:22.946 --> 03:24:26.228]  We're gonna do what they say can't be done.
[03:24:29.551 --> 03:24:30.892]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:30.972 --> 03:24:31.673]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:24:31.733 --> 03:24:38.398]  I wonder what Smokey and the Bandit would have to say about a Google car traveling at 24 miles an hour in a 35 mile an hour zone.
[03:24:39.078 --> 03:24:41.460]  That was an article we had at the beginning of the show.
[03:24:41.480 --> 03:24:45.823]  Finally, they pulled one of these things over and gave him a ticket.
[03:24:46.224 --> 03:24:47.785]  And I guess the question is, who gets the ticket?
[03:24:47.825 --> 03:24:49.987]  Does Google get the ticket or the passenger?
[03:24:50.047 --> 03:24:55.491]  Because you know there's no steering wheel, no pedal, and that you have absolutely no control and you're an idiot if you put yourself
[03:24:55.911 --> 03:25:00.012]  I don't know the control of some machine like that, in my opinion.
[03:25:00.032 --> 03:25:02.633]  We're going to go back to your calls here.
[03:25:03.053 --> 03:25:06.734]  Before we do, I want to let you know about two specials that we've got just for this weekend.
[03:25:06.754 --> 03:25:11.035]  We've got Winter Sun Vitamin D3 20% off just through the end of this weekend.
[03:25:11.255 --> 03:25:13.875]  And we have a new product, Living Defense.
[03:25:14.196 --> 03:25:18.857]  We're expected to sell out this week, but you can find that now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:25:20.137 --> 03:25:24.319]  And before we go to our calls, this one story I'd be remiss if I didn't mention this.
[03:25:24.359 --> 03:25:26.000]  This is from antiwar.com.
[03:25:26.560 --> 03:25:31.482]  They point out, interviewed on CNN today, retired General John Allen, recently replaced at the U.S.
[03:25:31.622 --> 03:25:36.744]  Special Envoy to the War Against ISIS, offered an extremely pessimistic assessment of the war, saying the U.S.
[03:25:36.784 --> 03:25:45.548]  needs to address the causes of symptoms like ISIS and Al Qaeda, and failing that, we will be condemned to fight forever.
[03:25:46.389 --> 03:25:46.629]  Yes.
[03:25:47.748 --> 03:25:48.309]  I agree with him.
[03:25:48.949 --> 03:25:52.393]  Now, I think we might disagree as to what the cause is.
[03:25:52.413 --> 03:26:10.831]  I think the cause is fundamentally the military-industrial complex and the CIA that has been arming, equipping, and training and using these jihadi Islamic terrorists as their surrogates, unless we expose that and understand that we will be condemned to fight forever.
[03:26:11.832 --> 03:26:28.803]  Just like Sisyphus, we will be running this empire and pushing this rock up the hill endlessly and letting it roll down again, roll down and crush us underneath it, and then have somebody else in our culture, our family, have to push that rock up again the hill.
[03:26:28.823 --> 03:26:30.524]  I mean, this is the kind of
[03:26:32.145 --> 03:26:40.170]  Punishment that we've been condemned to, not by some mythological Greek gods, but by the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about.
[03:26:40.631 --> 03:26:53.319]  Yes, we are condemned to fight forever, unless we wake up and understand what the cause of these wars are, who these people are, where they came from, and the fact that they are our creations, our surrogates.
[03:26:54.320 --> 03:26:56.501]  Let's go to Emma in Kentucky.
[03:26:56.562 --> 03:26:58.363]  You had a comment about climate control.
[03:26:58.403 --> 03:26:58.623]  Go ahead.
[03:27:02.293 --> 03:27:04.073]  Emma from Kentucky, is she there?
[03:27:04.254 --> 03:27:05.274]  Okay, she's not there.
[03:27:05.294 --> 03:27:07.914]  Alright, let's go to James in Ohio.
[03:27:07.954 --> 03:27:09.215]  James, PC Culture?
[03:27:10.875 --> 03:27:11.155]  Hi.
[03:27:11.175 --> 03:27:13.156]  Hello?
[03:27:13.576 --> 03:27:13.936]  Hello?
[03:27:14.316 --> 03:27:14.996]  Yes, go ahead Brian.
[03:27:15.896 --> 03:27:17.077]  James in Ohio, go ahead.
[03:27:17.297 --> 03:27:26.299]  As far as the situation with the borders in the United States and Europe, this is an old Stalinist tactic.
[03:27:26.399 --> 03:27:29.840]  He would have a population picked up wholesale
[03:27:30.538 --> 03:27:38.001]  And sit down in an area where the cultures, the religions, the heritage was as disparate as possible.
[03:27:38.381 --> 03:27:39.341]  Yeah, you're exactly right.
[03:27:39.642 --> 03:27:40.302]  Exactly right.
[03:27:40.482 --> 03:27:50.446]  In a very short time, the culture, heritage, religion of each would be destroyed, and the state could step in to replace all of that.
[03:27:51.186 --> 03:27:52.687]  And that's what they're trying to do now.
[03:27:53.187 --> 03:27:58.029]  The tactics differ as to how the migrants are created.
[03:27:58.049 --> 03:27:58.689]  In Mexico,
[03:28:00.319 --> 03:28:10.029]  It was the Rockefeller's Green Revolution that ruined their agricultural industry and drove them north.
[03:28:10.850 --> 03:28:13.953]  But now they have the wars, of course.
[03:28:14.349 --> 03:28:17.511]  Yes, you're exactly right, and of course, we've been saying that type of thing.
[03:28:17.672 --> 03:28:21.454]  You're right to point that out, that it was communists that successfully used that tactic.
[03:28:22.115 --> 03:28:30.321]  And of course, the Prime Minister of Hungary, Orban, has pointed this out, and specifically singling out George Soros.
[03:28:30.741 --> 03:28:35.285]  Orban criticized him, and this is an article from The New American, criticized him as being a dark hand.
[03:28:35.805 --> 03:28:43.047]  Behind the migrant influx, Soros replied, the Prime Minister's plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective.
[03:28:43.087 --> 03:28:48.089]  I mean, who would think that a Prime Minister would care that his border has nations, okay?
[03:28:48.369 --> 03:28:50.750]  And he says, and the refugees are an obstacle to that.
[03:28:51.450 --> 03:29:00.073]  He says, on the other hand, he says, my plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and the national borders as the obstacle.
[03:29:00.113 --> 03:29:01.954]  So, first of all, Soros admits
[03:29:02.734 --> 03:29:05.376]  That he wants to get rid of national borders.
[03:29:05.576 --> 03:29:08.498]  They're the obstacle, he says, to helping refugees.
[03:29:08.939 --> 03:29:09.219]  Okay?
[03:29:10.179 --> 03:29:12.681]  But understand, that is not his objective.
[03:29:12.721 --> 03:29:16.304]  His objective is global governance, just as James just pointed out.
[03:29:16.524 --> 03:29:20.027]  And it is the refugees that are the means of achieving that.
[03:29:20.107 --> 03:29:22.829]  And the Prime Minister of Hungary said, by whom?
[03:29:23.169 --> 03:29:24.290]  And on what authority?
[03:29:24.730 --> 03:29:33.095]  Were the European leaders tasked with not only admitting, but transporting to a European continent hundreds of thousands of people from groups outside of European culture?
[03:29:33.556 --> 03:29:37.478]  So that little by little, European cultural identity would be called into question.
[03:29:38.219 --> 03:29:38.679]  Exactly right.
[03:29:38.719 --> 03:29:40.920]  I want to get your comments on that, James in Ohio.
[03:29:40.940 --> 03:29:42.381]  When we come back, we'll take some more calls.
[03:29:42.421 --> 03:29:43.162]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:59.266 --> 03:30:02.275]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.217 --> 03:30:05.905]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:11.193 --> 03:30:15.896]  New report expects a million cancer deaths from Fukushima fallout.
[03:30:16.456 --> 03:30:19.037]  Underestimated and under-reported.
[03:30:19.477 --> 03:30:22.879]  Article up at InfoWars.com by Christian Seric.
[03:30:23.600 --> 03:30:32.484]  In a new report published by Fair Wind Energy Education, or FEE, cancer is on the rise in post-Fukushima Japan.
[03:30:32.724 --> 03:30:37.627]  We learned that the ongoing multi-core nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima
[03:30:37.807 --> 03:30:53.357]  This plant has produced approximately 230 times higher than normal thyroid cancers in Fukushima Prefecture and could result in as many as 1 million more cancers due to the incident that happened in March of 2011.
[03:30:54.878 --> 03:31:02.624]  Five years later and we are still getting a grip on how catastrophic Fukushima truly was to this planet and its people.
[03:31:03.184 --> 03:31:06.546]  You can read more about this at InfoWars.com.
[03:31:06.726 --> 03:31:07.407]  I'm Joe Biggs.

[03:31:11.489 --> 03:31:11.630]  Mine!

[03:33:02.434 --> 03:33:03.894]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:33:03.914 --> 03:33:05.675]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:22.330 --> 03:33:23.771]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.811 --> 03:33:26.353]  I'm David Knight, your host, and we're taking your calls.
[03:33:26.373 --> 03:33:38.363]  We were talking to James in Ohio, and he pointed out that the process by which they are bringing in immigrants in Europe and taking down the culture there, taking down the national borders, and they admit that now.
[03:33:38.764 --> 03:33:46.250]  We've had George Soros talk about how national borders are an obstacle, needs to be taken away so that he can help refugees.
[03:33:46.270 --> 03:33:47.571]  Well, are they really refugees?
[03:33:47.611 --> 03:33:48.732]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[03:33:49.639 --> 03:34:00.388]  But of course, we've had other globalists talking about how national borders are an anachronism, how they're a shibboleth, how they are something from the past, and they're going to get rid of it.
[03:34:00.428 --> 03:34:02.250]  They're openly talking about this.
[03:34:02.270 --> 03:34:04.291]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[03:34:05.032 --> 03:34:05.993]  It is a conspiracy.
[03:34:06.013 --> 03:34:06.934]  It's not a theory.
[03:34:07.194 --> 03:34:09.316]  It's an open conspiracy to do this.
[03:34:09.696 --> 03:34:17.719]  I want to go back and get James' comments on this because he'd point out this is something that's been done successfully and been done often by communists.
[03:34:18.040 --> 03:34:21.281]  James, your comments on what the Hungarian Prime Minister is saying.
[03:34:22.522 --> 03:34:29.224]  Well, the difference between Stalin's time and now is that we have the experience with Stalin to go on.
[03:34:30.085 --> 03:34:34.967]  And people are self-educated in political realities.
[03:34:35.652 --> 03:34:35.772]  Yes.
[03:35:02.085 --> 03:35:04.206]  The swift strike ought to miss us.
[03:35:04.786 --> 03:35:05.926]  Yes, yes, exactly.
[03:35:06.407 --> 03:35:08.327]  You know, I think there's some parallels to be drawn here.
[03:35:08.347 --> 03:35:13.789]  We were talking earlier in the program about the people who are wringing their hands and saying, this is the demise of hard news.
[03:35:13.829 --> 03:35:15.910]  We're going to go to opinion journalism.
[03:35:15.970 --> 03:35:19.371]  Of course, those are not opinions just divorced from the facts.
[03:35:19.431 --> 03:35:23.673]  If the opinions are completely divorced from facts, then they're obviously worthless.
[03:35:23.693 --> 03:35:27.374]  But one of the things they were talking about was, well, everybody's expressing their opinion on the Internet.
[03:35:27.394 --> 03:35:29.535]  Everybody's exchanging ideas on the Internet.
[03:35:30.055 --> 03:35:44.572]  I think we are, because of the internet, because of that ability to communicate back and forth with people, just like you said, James, we are at a kind of position in history similar to what immediately preceded
[03:35:45.293 --> 03:35:48.276]  The revolution in America.
[03:35:48.296 --> 03:35:54.201]  And they hark back and say, yeah, we haven't seen this kind of opinion journalism for a couple hundred years now.
[03:35:54.761 --> 03:35:58.184]  And, of course, what was driving that was the access to books.
[03:35:58.345 --> 03:35:59.566]  You know, first you had the printing press.
[03:35:59.626 --> 03:36:04.770]  It took a couple hundred years for that to get to the point where people really had access to information.
[03:36:05.151 --> 03:36:06.492]  And that really started changing things.
[03:36:06.812 --> 03:36:15.359]  When people could start reading things for themselves when they weren't being force-fed by the authorities and told what to believe and given a homogenous situation.
[03:36:15.379 --> 03:36:20.984]  But they could go out there and do their own research and read in a way that they'd never done before because of the printing press.
[03:36:21.745 --> 03:36:26.289]  That really changed things and I think we're seeing that again with the Internet as well.
[03:36:27.009 --> 03:36:27.510]  Thank you, James.
[03:36:27.570 --> 03:36:32.214]  I want to go to Jean in Minnesota in just a moment, but I want to point out one other thing that
[03:36:33.135 --> 03:36:38.364]  The Hungarian Prime Minister was talking about this in this article in the New American.
[03:36:38.404 --> 03:36:46.378]  Of course, you know, George Soros and the multinational globalists have their own agenda, and the people that they're bringing in have their own agenda as well.
[03:36:47.965 --> 03:36:52.429]  Primarily in Europe, it's migrants from the Middle East as well as from Africa.
[03:36:52.489 --> 03:36:54.591]  Well, what are the Middle Easterners' agenda?
[03:36:54.631 --> 03:37:03.419]  Well, they have a Jordanian opposition leader, Dr. Mudar Zahran, himself a Muslim asylum seeker currently living in the UK.
[03:37:03.459 --> 03:37:06.842]  He warned last month that Muslim migrants are not what they appear to be.
[03:37:06.862 --> 03:37:12.247]  He said they should be kept out of Europe because they are part of the Islamic conquest of the West.
[03:37:12.887 --> 03:37:15.552]  He says, Europeans are being played for fools.
[03:37:15.592 --> 03:37:18.658]  He said, read the Arab magazines, the Arab newspapers.
[03:37:18.678 --> 03:37:23.006]  They're talking about, good job, now we're going to conquer Europe.
[03:37:23.026 --> 03:37:24.849]  He says, it's not even a secret.
[03:37:25.526 --> 03:37:30.709]  And of course others are pointing out, Michelle Hickford says this is actually an ancient strategy.
[03:37:31.329 --> 03:37:38.692]  James of Ohio was just talking about how the communists would use a strategy that the globalists are doing right now, bringing in disparate populations.
[03:37:38.712 --> 03:37:43.915]  But of course those populations have their own motivations and George Soros and company are well aware of that.
[03:37:44.335 --> 03:37:47.917]  And she said this is actually an ancient strategy on the Islamic side as well.
[03:37:48.377 --> 03:37:50.018]  Straight from the Islamic playbook called the
[03:37:51.098 --> 03:37:54.321]  If I'm pronouncing that correctly, or a migration or a journey.
[03:37:54.421 --> 03:37:56.824]  She says it's the most effective method of jihad.
[03:37:57.284 --> 03:38:00.787]  It requires no military, no wars, but it's nevertheless an invasion.
[03:38:00.827 --> 03:38:05.451]  And I'm reminded of what Bobby Jindal, who's running, said about immigration.
[03:38:05.491 --> 03:38:09.195]  He said, immigration without assimilation is invasion.
[03:38:09.755 --> 03:38:23.218]  Because when you go into a country and you say, I have absolutely no respect for your laws, your traditions, your cultures, your language, I'm not going to conform to anything that you have to say here, but I'm going to demand that you give me this, this, and this, that is a hostile invasion.
[03:38:23.238 --> 03:38:25.339]  Now let's look at the other side of this.
[03:38:25.359 --> 03:38:27.479]  Let's look at the African side of this.
[03:38:28.319 --> 03:38:32.000]  And of course, they've got a conference going on right now in Malta.
[03:38:33.020 --> 03:38:33.821]  This week happened.
[03:38:34.021 --> 03:38:38.742]  Sixty European leaders and African leaders meeting in the Maltese capital.
[03:38:39.776 --> 03:38:47.361]  And what they offered them was two billion dollars to the African nations to take back these migrants who don't qualify for asylum.
[03:38:47.381 --> 03:38:50.364]  In other words, they know that they're there strictly for economic reasons.
[03:38:50.404 --> 03:38:53.406]  This is a story that was on InfoWars.com yesterday from Kurt Nimmo.
[03:38:54.086 --> 03:38:56.348]  He says, however, the African nations refused it.
[03:38:56.448 --> 03:38:57.629]  And here's why they refused it.
[03:38:58.663 --> 03:39:02.206]  They currently get $20 billion of aid from the Europeans.
[03:39:02.266 --> 03:39:03.828]  And so the Europeans said, we'll give you another 10%.
[03:39:04.068 --> 03:39:17.982]  We'll give you another $2 billion if you'll take these refugees, these migrants, they're not refugees, these migrants who've come here for economic reasons, if you'll take them back because we can't assimilate them, they don't want to be assimilated, we're unable to assimilate, for whatever reason, okay?
[03:39:18.002 --> 03:39:21.245]  We'll give you $2 billion to deal with the cost of bringing them back.
[03:39:21.265 --> 03:39:21.845]  And they said no.
[03:39:22.786 --> 03:39:33.455]  They said the biggest concern, and this is what Kurt wrote, the biggest concern is return of illegal immigrants putting an end to remittance, the sending of money by migrants to relatives in Africa.
[03:39:33.475 --> 03:39:36.918]  So they estimate that at being slightly over 11 billion dollars a year.
[03:39:37.847 --> 03:39:48.778]  They say sending back economic migrants will put considerable pressure on the country of origin, because if these people go back, wages will drop by 90%, said a lead economist with the World Bank.
[03:39:49.299 --> 03:39:53.583]  So in other words, 90% of their economy is coming from people sending money back home.
[03:39:54.384 --> 03:39:55.184]  That's $11 billion.
[03:39:55.604 --> 03:39:57.085]  So, how do you deal with that?
[03:39:57.425 --> 03:40:01.046]  I mean, do you let yourself be taken hostage by that?
[03:40:01.566 --> 03:40:03.906]  They're admitting that they're not refugees.
[03:40:04.086 --> 03:40:07.127]  See, it's not a humanitarian operation like George Soros wants to pretend.
[03:40:07.507 --> 03:40:10.648]  This is an economic takeover for the people who are coming from Africa.
[03:40:11.048 --> 03:40:14.569]  It is a religious and cultural takeover for the people that are coming from the Middle East.
[03:40:15.069 --> 03:40:15.149]  Yes.
[03:40:45.880 --> 03:40:54.506]  I have been tracing this, as Joe Bates said, the PCP, the pansies, which I like.
[03:40:54.546 --> 03:40:55.507]  That was great.
[03:40:56.748 --> 03:40:57.088]  Back.
[03:40:57.989 --> 03:41:14.561]  Now, as far as I know, as a parent and as also a holder of two degrees that I helped pay for, one of the first 10 words a toddler learns is, why?
[03:41:16.351 --> 03:41:16.611]  Why?
[03:41:17.291 --> 03:41:19.132]  When did this disappear?
[03:41:19.172 --> 03:41:27.115]  Was it that the parents are too lazy to spend the time with their children to explore different ideas?
[03:41:27.795 --> 03:41:32.116]  Is it the nanny state high schools we're sending them to?
[03:41:32.556 --> 03:41:33.777]  That's what I think it is.
[03:41:33.857 --> 03:41:34.937]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:41:35.618 --> 03:41:36.458]  I think it's the schools.
[03:41:36.478 --> 03:41:37.758]  It's a homogenous idea.
[03:41:39.019 --> 03:41:45.801]  And then they get to college and they have no idea to ask why for anything?
[03:41:46.289 --> 03:41:49.111]  I'm 52 years old and I'm still asking, why?
[03:41:49.131 --> 03:41:54.395]  And when did that get out of the lexicon of our children?
[03:41:55.267 --> 03:42:05.477]  Well, you know, if you want my opinion, I think it is drilled into people K-12 and also in college that you listen to people in authority.
[03:42:05.497 --> 03:42:06.138]  We're in authority.
[03:42:06.178 --> 03:42:07.359]  We're standing in front of the classroom.
[03:42:07.379 --> 03:42:08.480]  We're going to tell you what to think.
[03:42:08.500 --> 03:42:10.782]  We're going to tell you about this issue or that issue.
[03:42:11.183 --> 03:42:16.048]  You're going to buy into this consensus or you're going to be ostracized because of it.
[03:42:16.628 --> 03:42:17.748]  And I think it comes from that.
[03:42:17.788 --> 03:42:18.649]  I think they do that.
[03:42:18.689 --> 03:42:20.169]  We saw that happen with the news.
[03:42:20.229 --> 03:42:28.972]  I mean, when we had the supposed hard news where there was only, you're old enough, you remember when we had just three news networks.
[03:42:29.112 --> 03:42:33.433]  And they pretty much said exactly the same thing because they're all reading from the government's script.
[03:42:33.473 --> 03:42:39.835]  And so nobody questions them because, you know, Walter Cronkite and he's an authority and David Brinkley, the Huntley Brinkley report.
[03:42:39.855 --> 03:42:54.198]  I mean, they're the authorities, we listen to them, we do what they say, they're all saying essentially the same thing, covering the same stories, covering them, saying the same things about all the same stories, and that is what has started to unravel for these people with the freedom of the Internet, and they really don't like that.
[03:42:56.498 --> 03:42:58.358]  It still goes back to the parents.
[03:42:58.759 --> 03:43:06.600]  My father was a lawyer for 54 years, and he would encourage me to find out what my ideas were.
[03:43:07.299 --> 03:43:10.261]  Or, let me ask the question, why?
[03:43:10.281 --> 03:43:14.723]  And if he had an answer that wasn't complete enough, I'd say, why again?
[03:43:14.743 --> 03:43:15.904]  Yes, exactly.
[03:43:16.004 --> 03:43:19.626]  And we had many dining room table debates over things.
[03:43:20.286 --> 03:43:23.588]  Well, certainly, and that was the whole point of a liberal education.
[03:43:24.369 --> 03:43:41.226]  Was to liberate you to do your own inquiry, to investigate yourself, you know, to investigate the facts yourself, to have the tools of learning so that you could make your own decisions as an intelligent thinking person rather than just parroting back the standard consensus that's being fed to you.
[03:43:42.467 --> 03:43:43.348]  Yes, thank you so much.
[03:43:43.688 --> 03:43:45.890]  Let's go to Paul in New Jersey.
[03:43:45.991 --> 03:43:47.973]  Paul, you want to talk about political correctness as well.
[03:43:48.013 --> 03:43:48.273]  Go ahead.
[03:43:49.238 --> 03:43:49.879]  Okay.
[03:43:52.000 --> 03:43:55.843]  People don't realize we've been taken over a long time ago, right from the get-go.
[03:43:58.264 --> 03:44:03.168]  The Constitution was set aside in 1933 after the bankruptcy.
[03:44:03.928 --> 03:44:06.870]  And in 1913, we became communists.
[03:44:06.890 --> 03:44:11.153]  We were communists before the communists were, and we're still operating under the Communist Manifesto.
[03:44:12.334 --> 03:44:16.217]  If you don't believe me, look at all these so-called agencies and everything.
[03:44:17.173 --> 03:44:18.414]  The same thing we had in 1776.
[03:44:18.995 --> 03:44:24.881]  We were harassed by all these public agencies and taxes and this and that.
[03:44:25.482 --> 03:44:30.928]  I say it this way, we're being radiated, chemicalized, plasticized, and psychologicalized.
[03:44:31.288 --> 03:44:32.550]  And this is a land of the free.
[03:44:34.692 --> 03:44:35.732]  Yes, exactly.
[03:44:51.017 --> 03:44:58.345]  Uh, when they amended the Constitution and said, we're going to prohibit alcohol, they knew that they had no authority to do that, but they had enough respect for the Constitution to do that.
[03:44:58.825 --> 03:45:02.990]  But then, after they repealed alcohol prohibition, they just said, we're going to prohibit whatever we want.
[03:45:03.130 --> 03:45:09.436]  They don't even pretend to obey the Constitution, whether it's that or whether, uh, it's, we can go to any number of issues.
[03:45:09.496 --> 03:45:11.739]  I mean, just look at what they're doing at the airports with the TSA.
[03:45:12.559 --> 03:45:18.941]  They clearly don't care to even pretend that they're going to get search warrants, that they're going to have due process.
[03:45:19.321 --> 03:45:26.243]  They don't even pretend to care they're going to give us a trial and accuse us of some wrongdoing before they're going to confiscate our property.
[03:45:26.283 --> 03:45:32.365]  No, they use civil asset forfeiture and just take your car without even accusing you of a crime, let alone finding you guilty.
[03:45:32.725 --> 03:45:37.007]  So yeah, they don't even make a pretense of obeying the Constitution anymore.
[03:45:37.107 --> 03:45:37.827]  Thank you, Paul.
[03:45:37.847 --> 03:45:40.368]  Let's go to Robert in Alabama.
[03:45:40.408 --> 03:45:40.648]  Robert?
[03:45:42.461 --> 03:45:54.744]  Yes, um, I live in Alabama and I have seen, this high school I used to go to has been, the runway has been extended.
[03:45:54.764 --> 03:45:57.104]  They turned it into a runway.
[03:45:57.984 --> 03:45:59.105]  It's been extended.
[03:46:00.125 --> 03:46:01.565]  I live on top of a hill.
[03:46:03.326 --> 03:46:08.347]  And I have seen jets, I have seen huge
[03:46:11.511 --> 03:46:13.412]  Huge military aircraft.
[03:46:14.852 --> 03:46:17.873]  I've seen them unloading things like MRAPs.
[03:46:19.894 --> 03:46:23.855]  I've seen them unloading what looks to be ammo.
[03:46:25.516 --> 03:46:30.618]  I have seen them basically being real sketchy.
[03:46:32.719 --> 03:46:39.561]  And I want to know if you think this is signs of what to come.
[03:46:40.643 --> 03:46:41.343]  Well, absolutely.
[03:46:41.483 --> 03:46:43.144]  This is not anything that's new.
[03:46:43.204 --> 03:46:46.264]  The principles have always been there.
[03:46:46.865 --> 03:46:52.266]  We were warned by Madison, he said, the means of defense abroad have always become the instruments of tyranny at home.
[03:46:52.286 --> 03:46:54.467]  That's why they didn't want to see a standing army.
[03:46:55.047 --> 03:47:00.068]  We have had a standing army now since World War II, and we've had continuous wars since World War II.
[03:47:00.488 --> 03:47:06.690]  Just as this general is saying, General John Allen, who's retired, he says, if we don't understand the cause of this stuff,
[03:47:07.510 --> 03:47:09.491]  We're going to be condemned to fight forever.
[03:47:09.571 --> 03:47:11.152]  That's precisely the point.
[03:47:11.192 --> 03:47:14.654]  That's what a standing army, what a military-industrial complex wants to do.
[03:47:14.694 --> 03:47:18.116]  It wants the country to be in a state of continual war.
[03:47:18.676 --> 03:47:21.357]  Because it makes money for them, it keeps them in power.
[03:47:22.038 --> 03:47:26.640]  And if we don't understand that, this standing army is going to be standing on our throats.
[03:47:26.740 --> 03:47:34.084]  And we see this increasingly, that the government is militarizing the police, and they're using the military as police.
[03:47:35.805 --> 03:47:38.357]  They're converging all of this under the control of...
[03:47:39.744 --> 03:48:00.831]  The President, and I think it's very interesting that nobody called into question what Chris Christie said on Veterans Day, saying that Hillary disrespects our veterans on the VA, and Obama disrespects our law enforcement officers in uniform so he doesn't have the moral authority to command them, or whatever, okay?
[03:48:01.111 --> 03:48:08.894]  In other words, he's saying that law enforcement is in uniform, like some kind of paramilitary thing, and certainly that's what we see.
[03:48:09.454 --> 03:48:10.535]  I mean, look at the pictures.
[03:48:11.415 --> 03:48:14.718]  They're indistinguishable, as we have been told multiple times.
[03:48:14.878 --> 03:48:24.345]  I remember in New Hampshire, when they were, that small town that was pushing back against the MRAPs, and there was a retired Marine Colonel there, and he says, you guys are better equipped than we were in Fallujah.
[03:48:25.326 --> 03:48:37.635]  It is clearly militarized, it is being consolidated at a single source, and Chris Christie is just fine with that, and so is everybody else, because nobody is even pointing out that he made that comment.
[03:48:38.308 --> 03:48:42.169]  And of course, this is another guy who could care less what the Constitution says.
[03:48:42.549 --> 03:48:53.733]  Conservatives need to understand that on a variety of issues, I mean, whether it's, you know, they get people afraid, they want law enforcement, they want to feel as if they're safe.
[03:48:53.773 --> 03:49:03.095]  And that sense of security, that false sense of security, that idolizing safety over everything else is going to turn you into slaves.
[03:49:03.155 --> 03:49:05.036]  It's turning us into slaves step by step.
[03:49:06.271 --> 03:49:09.034]  When you give up your liberty, you're never safe.
[03:49:09.895 --> 03:49:11.177]  You simply become a slave.
[03:49:11.197 --> 03:49:15.602]  And so we see that at the airports, we see that with the police and the way they interact with people.
[03:49:15.962 --> 03:49:18.225]  That is what's happening, and it's clearly a militarization.
[03:49:18.725 --> 03:49:25.633]  And you know, Robert, we were warned about that 200 years ago, and the reason they were able to tell us that is not because
[03:49:26.903 --> 03:49:27.903]  Times are any different.
[03:49:28.203 --> 03:49:31.884]  They didn't have the military tools that we have now, but that's not the issue.
[03:49:31.944 --> 03:49:35.605]  The issue is the hearts, the minds, the souls of people.
[03:49:35.645 --> 03:49:36.605]  That doesn't change.
[03:49:36.665 --> 03:49:38.225]  Human nature does not change.
[03:49:38.285 --> 03:49:43.207]  They knew what would happen when you consolidated power, and we are seeing the fruits of that now.
[03:49:43.687 --> 03:49:44.547]  So they could warn us.
[03:49:44.607 --> 03:49:48.308]  Madison could look at this and say, this is a pattern that's been repeated through history.
[03:49:48.348 --> 03:49:48.648]  Why?
[03:49:48.708 --> 03:49:49.988]  Because human nature doesn't change.
[03:49:50.128 --> 03:49:55.692]  It doesn't matter if they're doing it with bows and arrows or if they're doing it with autonomous killing machines.
[03:49:55.772 --> 03:49:55.952]  Okay?
[03:49:55.993 --> 03:49:57.454]  Human nature doesn't change.
[03:49:57.474 --> 03:50:01.797]  They're going to want to dominate the people that create this empire.
[03:50:01.817 --> 03:50:04.839]  And that's what we've had really going back to the Civil War.
[03:50:04.899 --> 03:50:10.464]  We started creating an American empire at that point by consolidating power into the center.
[03:50:10.504 --> 03:50:11.544]  Anything else you want to say, Robert?
[03:50:20.461 --> 03:50:21.262]  These things.
[03:50:22.062 --> 03:50:29.369]  Men in black military uniforms, no name tags, things like that.
[03:50:30.349 --> 03:50:37.215]  Do you think that maybe our next president will do something about that?
[03:50:37.235 --> 03:50:40.278]  As long as it's not, I don't know, Hillary?
[03:50:41.664 --> 03:50:42.185]  Oh, I don't know.
[03:50:42.225 --> 03:50:42.865]  It's hard to say.
[03:50:42.905 --> 03:50:46.628]  And of course, you know, when we just saw what... It's the nature of what we have.
[03:50:46.688 --> 03:50:48.350]  Unless we stop the standing army.
[03:50:48.390 --> 03:50:49.971]  Unless we go back to something like the militia.
[03:50:49.991 --> 03:50:52.253]  But the militia is being demonized by the press.
[03:50:52.814 --> 03:50:54.035]  And look at the public's attitude.
[03:50:54.075 --> 03:50:55.556]  Look at what happened in California.
[03:50:55.596 --> 03:51:00.420]  They said, hey, they just shot off nuclear weapons so close to us, it lit up the entire sky.
[03:51:00.440 --> 03:51:01.081]  But that's okay!
[03:51:01.101 --> 03:51:02.562]  You know, they're testing missiles.
[03:51:02.923 --> 03:51:03.863]  It keeps us safe.
[03:51:04.224 --> 03:51:06.105]  We're going to be right back with more of your calls and comments.
[03:51:06.165 --> 03:51:06.526]  Stay with us.
[03:51:09.958 --> 03:51:12.059]  Don't take a cold or flu lying down.
[03:51:12.460 --> 03:51:15.241]  Stand up and fight back with Supernatural Silver.

[03:54:29.522 --> 03:54:30.744]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:30.784 --> 03:54:33.927]  I'm David Knight and we're going to return to your calls here in just a moment.
[03:54:34.428 --> 03:54:39.534]  Before we do, I want to let you know about the specials that we have that will probably end this weekend.
[03:54:40.315 --> 03:54:41.277]  One of them definitely will.

[03:55:28.101 --> 03:55:30.723]  Natural way to get rid of those organisms.
[03:55:30.763 --> 03:55:31.383]  A new product.
[03:55:31.423 --> 03:55:33.005]  We're expected to sell that very quickly.
[03:55:33.065 --> 03:55:34.446]  Read the information about that.
[03:55:34.566 --> 03:55:43.192]  Read the reviews and you can see the five-minute video that Dr. Group did with Alex Jones explaining the situation that it is there to address.
[03:55:43.252 --> 03:55:46.114]  Again, you can get that at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:55:46.674 --> 03:55:50.277]  Let's go to Wayne in Colorado.
[03:55:50.317 --> 03:55:52.659]  Wayne, you want to talk about the Free College Movement.
[03:55:52.679 --> 03:55:53.039]  Go ahead.
[03:55:54.380 --> 03:55:54.680]  Oh, hi.
[03:55:54.740 --> 03:55:55.121]  Thank you.
[03:55:55.561 --> 03:55:56.602]  Just a comment, you know.
[03:55:57.543 --> 03:56:01.965]  I've always grown up thinking and knowing that, you know, you don't appreciate anything you don't work for and earn.
[03:56:02.606 --> 03:56:06.368]  So it'd be just like me giving a high school kid a brand new car that he didn't deserve.
[03:56:06.728 --> 03:56:07.489]  He's going to trash it.
[03:56:07.549 --> 03:56:08.529]  He's not going to take care of it.
[03:56:08.549 --> 03:56:10.590]  It's the same thing, I believe, with their education.
[03:56:10.610 --> 03:56:12.691]  They're just not going to really care, you know?
[03:56:12.912 --> 03:56:15.813]  They're just there for two years, don't like what you're doing.
[03:56:15.833 --> 03:56:18.795]  They're going to change, you know, and just move around and waste their time, I think.
[03:56:19.341 --> 03:56:19.762]  Absolutely.
[03:56:19.782 --> 03:56:22.646]  And you know, they have to look at the back end of this as well.
[03:56:22.666 --> 03:56:27.573]  There was an article from Paul Joseph Watson yesterday about politicians in Germany calling for compulsory labor.
[03:56:28.014 --> 03:56:32.320]  They were going to make university graduates commit to a year of social service.
[03:56:32.340 --> 03:56:34.043]  A government that can give you free stuff
[03:56:34.623 --> 03:56:40.187]  At the expense of other people, making other people, turning other people into slaves to labor for you.
[03:56:40.607 --> 03:56:42.789]  They can do that in any number of ways.
[03:56:43.109 --> 03:56:48.352]  And you know, Wayne, when my parents went to high school, it was a big deal to graduate from high school.
[03:56:48.813 --> 03:56:53.996]  You know, back in the early part of the 20th century, most people didn't go to high school.
[03:56:54.016 --> 03:56:59.100]  It was kind of a new thing, and it was a really big deal if you just got a bachelor's degree, if you went to college.
[03:56:59.640 --> 03:57:01.262]  And now, it's become expected.
[03:57:01.322 --> 03:57:09.629]  It's not really, everybody says, oh, you know, a high school degree, that really isn't very valuable, and it's going to be the same thing with a college degree if it's provided for free to everybody.
[03:57:09.669 --> 03:57:12.772]  Just like you're saying, you get something for free, you don't really value it.
[03:57:14.284 --> 03:57:15.625]  Yeah, that's what I see happening.
[03:57:15.685 --> 03:57:20.388]  If it happens, and I really don't think it's going to, but anything's possible these days.
[03:57:20.408 --> 03:57:24.250]  Yeah, well if they federalize it, they can do it because they will just prep more money for it.
[03:57:24.331 --> 03:57:34.497]  But it's another way, I think the more sinister aspect of that is that the longer you stay in school, the longer you stay out of the real world, the more childlike and accepting of authority you become.
[03:57:34.577 --> 03:57:43.603]  I think that's a real danger and that's why it's being pushed so hard by the socialists and by the people who are really part of the system like Marco Rubio
[03:57:43.683 --> 03:57:44.203]  Thank you, Wayne.
[03:57:44.223 --> 03:57:45.944]  Let's go to Dwayne in Texas.
[03:57:45.964 --> 03:57:46.584]  Dwayne, go ahead.
[03:57:49.244 --> 03:57:59.967]  Yes, when the Fort Hood shooter, 24 hours before the Fort Hood shooter did his thing, I told my mom, they're going to have to get this march on Washington off the news.
[03:58:00.387 --> 03:58:09.189]  They're going to have to stop talking about the Republican victory or the conservative victory in the election they had just had.
[03:58:09.650 --> 03:58:11.110]  Because that's all they were talking about.
[03:58:11.130 --> 03:58:11.470]  I was like,
[03:58:12.225 --> 03:58:13.686]  The media is destructional.
[03:58:13.706 --> 03:58:14.727]  They're not acting normal.
[03:58:14.767 --> 03:58:18.749]  I said, Mom, there will be a crazy man shooting up everybody tomorrow.
[03:58:18.789 --> 03:58:19.229]  That's true.
[03:58:19.249 --> 03:58:19.690]  They come up.
[03:58:19.710 --> 03:58:20.250]  We're out of time.
[03:58:20.290 --> 03:58:20.810]  Sorry, Duane.
[03:58:20.830 --> 03:58:21.331]  Yeah, it's true.
[03:58:21.751 --> 03:58:29.196]  They have a number of ways that they can control things, but of course, unfortunately, too, we saw that the Republican victory didn't really change anything, did it?
[03:58:29.476 --> 03:58:33.418]  Because the people who control the party are indistinguishable from the Democrats.
[03:58:33.438 --> 03:58:34.779]  We have a single party in Washington.
[03:58:34.819 --> 03:58:36.140]  That's it for today's broadcast.
[03:58:36.460 --> 03:58:39.162]  Join us tonight at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:39.222 --> 03:58:40.323]  Eastern for the nightly news.
