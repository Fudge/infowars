[00:00:01.648 --> 00:00:04.390]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:04.991 --> 00:00:11.776]  What's his name?
[00:00:11.796 --> 00:00:13.898]  This is an emergency transmission.
[00:00:13.998 --> 00:00:14.598]  It's the 16th.
[00:00:15.038 --> 00:00:20.823]  This is an emergency transmission.
[00:00:21.343 --> 00:00:27.568]  From FEMA Region 6 in Occupy.
[00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.095]  There is a war.
[00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:36.536]  It's happening now.
[00:00:37.397 --> 00:00:39.198]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:41.600]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:43.802]  We are the resistance.
[00:00:44.262 --> 00:00:46.144]  We are the Infowar.
[00:00:46.444 --> 00:00:48.166]  It's now November 2nd, 2015.
[00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:48.166]  2015. 2015.
[00:00:53.427 --> 00:01:00.409]  You may have noticed CISA, a version of the cyber security bill passed in Congress with the Senate voting 74 to 21 to pass it.
[00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:07.150]  All in the name of a cyber defense to protect the American people and more importantly big business from hackers.
[00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:09.891]  And that's all you need to know America, go back to sleep.
[00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:16.933]  What they didn't tell you was the NSA and big business slipped a Trojan horse past the American people once again.
[00:01:17.293 --> 00:01:19.174]  To allow them to spy on you.
[00:01:19.554 --> 00:01:20.755]  Yes, you.
[00:01:21.135 --> 00:01:32.181]  Wired Magazine reports privacy advocates and civil liberties groups see CISA as a free pass that allows companies to monitor users and share their information with the government without a warrant.
[00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:37.323]  While offering a backdoor that circumvents any laws that might protect users' privacy.
[00:01:37.684 --> 00:01:50.230]  The incentive and the framework it creates is for companies to quickly and massively collect user information and ship it to the government, says Mark Jaycox, legislative analyst for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.933]  As soon as you do, he continues, you obtain broad immunity, even if you violated privacy law.
[00:01:57.213 --> 00:02:04.257]  Even the Department of Homeland Security agrees that the latest CISA bill could sweep away many important privacy protections.
[00:02:04.618 --> 00:02:26.591]  Breitbart reports, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, a Democrat who recently allied with Senator Rand Paul to water down provisions of the Patriot Act, said the bill virtually guarantees that private information unrelated to cybersecurity will be shared with the government, and said that the bill was a direct pipeline to the NSA.
[00:02:27.191 --> 00:02:35.178]  Even with the Manager's Amendment, the core privacy issues are not being dealt with.
[00:02:35.818 --> 00:02:40.803]  The fact is, it is voluntary for companies.
[00:02:41.803 --> 00:02:45.907]  It will be mandatory for their customers.
[00:02:47.328 --> 00:02:49.510]  And the fact is, the companies
[00:02:50.362 --> 00:03:03.233]  Can participate without the knowledge and consent of their customers and they are immune from customer oversight and lawsuits if
[00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:04.806]  They do suck!
[00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:13.373]  During the voting process of CISA, the Senate rejected all of the privacy amendments that would have protected average citizens' right to privacy.
[00:03:13.574 --> 00:03:15.315]  But how exactly did they do that?
[00:03:15.615 --> 00:03:25.164]  TechDirt breaks down the geek speak detailing the NSA's unconstitutional desperation to collect data related to innocent law-abiding Americans.
[00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:28.247]  The NSA and FBI, and CIA for that matter,
[00:03:28.487 --> 00:03:34.670]  Frequently make use of backdoor searches of the upstream data, a capability that was approved in 2011.
[00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:42.273]  Basically, the rules changed so that the intelligence community could sniff through data that was deemed collected incidentally.
[00:03:42.793 --> 00:03:50.816]  And that includes basically anything that is picked up in the upstream collection of data under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act.
[00:03:51.036 --> 00:04:01.538]  CISA is likely to be the key piece for letting the NSA and FBI warrantlessly spy on Americans after the FISA court limited that ability a few years ago.
[00:04:01.838 --> 00:04:17.522]  Is it any wonder when a $2.8 billion taxpayer-funded JLIN surveillance blimp becomes headline news as the average American citizen shirks when they clearly witness a criminal surveillance state goliath growing far too big to control?
[00:04:18.202 --> 00:04:22.766]  The NSA grows stronger as it collects more of our personal information.
[00:04:22.786 --> 00:04:23.787]  The U.S.
[00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:25.748]  Constitution grows weaker.
[00:04:36.198 --> 00:04:44.685]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this live, November 2nd, 2015 broadcast.
[00:04:44.725 --> 00:04:49.729]  We have several informative, important guests today, and obviously masses of keynotes.
[00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:54.572]  The situation with Russia, not just in Ukraine, but also in Syria, is escalating.
[00:04:55.513 --> 00:05:07.678]  There are also huge developments dealing with the abolition of our borders and our sovereignty, and with the radicalized Islamic invasion, not just of Europe, the United States, being expanded as well.
[00:05:07.738 --> 00:05:08.599]  Stay with us.
[00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:15.142]  Did you know governments around the world are attacking your free speech online in an attempt to control the internet like cable TV?
[00:05:15.222 --> 00:05:18.203]  For one thing, governments are paying online trolls to sway public opinion.
[00:05:18.383 --> 00:05:24.886]  The Turkish, Israeli, and Chinese governments, along with a host of others, are paying companies to, quote, correct misinformation on web forums.
[00:05:25.106 --> 00:05:25.526]  And the U.S.
[00:05:25.546 --> 00:05:34.935]  government has even hired a data security firm to create large numbers of fake social media profiles that could be used to spread propaganda, while also encountering anti-establishment viewpoints online.
[00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:43.063]  Also, an increasing number of mainstream news outlets are disabling or severely restricting comment sections to silence out critics that challenge the prevailing status quo pushed by the media.
[00:05:43.223 --> 00:05:48.348]  For example, Popular Science said it was killing its comics section to silence global warming skeptics.
[00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:52.732]  In other words, they don't want readers to have the ability to sway public opinion against their agenda.
[00:05:52.852 --> 00:06:00.639]  The ultimate endgame is to both eradicate free speech on the internet and to turn the internet into a tightly controlled medium where only government-approved viewpoints are allowed.
[00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:04.761]  In other words, governments want to bury the truth found on the internet in favor of government lies.
[00:06:04.942 --> 00:06:07.803]  You can find out more about the war on the internet at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:07.843 --> 00:06:09.224]  This is Kit Annals reporting.

[00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:13.609]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:19.991]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:27.132]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:07:27.452 --> 00:07:36.281]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.

[00:07:42.747 --> 00:07:45.910]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections and
[00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.490]  Adenosylcobalamin.
[00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.911]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:07:51.151 --> 00:07:52.772]  No needles, no injections.
[00:07:53.052 --> 00:07:54.532]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:07:54.692 --> 00:07:55.712]  Try it for yourself.

[00:08:19.835 --> 00:08:21.540]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:21.962 --> 00:08:24.851]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:08:40.404 --> 00:08:43.226]  Well, we have one of my favorite guests joining us today.
[00:08:43.286 --> 00:09:00.256]  For 30 minutes at the bottom of the next hour, Dr. Michael Savage will be coming on to talk about the state of the world and his new book, Government Zero, No Borders, No Language, No Culture, which is the globalist stated plan for no culture, but one world corporate socialism.
[00:09:01.117 --> 00:09:02.458]  Socialism for us on the bottom.
[00:09:03.939 --> 00:09:09.260]  Total corporate fascism, the new royalty on top with diplomatic immunity, tax immunity, you name it.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:15.822]  Michael Savage will be joining us, I believe via video Skype, coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:09:16.942 --> 00:09:19.043]  Total overwhelming news today.
[00:09:19.863 --> 00:09:23.924]  Everything we've been warning of happening worse than we thought it would.
[00:09:24.244 --> 00:09:25.664]  So actually, I've been inaccurate.
[00:09:25.964 --> 00:09:28.485]  Things are moving quicker and are more horrible than I thought.
[00:09:28.505 --> 00:09:30.326]  There you go.
[00:09:30.666 --> 00:09:32.026]  Our worst nightmares are coming true.
[00:09:33.168 --> 00:09:36.849]  Now, at the same time, there's always the opposite reaction under Newtonian physics.
[00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.610]  Equal and opposite reaction.
[00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.451]  There is a lot of people waking up.
[00:09:40.511 --> 00:09:42.932]  There's a lot of good things happening as well.
[00:09:42.972 --> 00:09:46.193]  But it is certainly a crazy time to be alive.
[00:09:47.273 --> 00:09:50.954]  First off, Obama promised no boots on the ground four years ago in Syria.
[00:09:51.275 --> 00:09:53.775]  There have always been US troops on the ground.
[00:09:54.656 --> 00:09:54.976]  In fact,
[00:09:56.727 --> 00:10:06.390]  Nemo wrote an article, and I meant to send it to you guys this weekend, where he had a map put out by the State Department of who controls what, and it's pretty accurate, in Iraq.
[00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:20.735]  Will you guys just pull up a map of who controls what areas, or the war in Syria, a map of the battles, so that we can show how there's that conduit coming up out of Iraq, all the way up into the north, up to Turkey.
[00:10:22.907 --> 00:10:33.956]  And if you look at that, you've got al-Qaeda, quote, al-Nusra slash ISIS coming in out of the east in Iraq, in that conduit, in the gray area you can see on screen.
[00:10:34.836 --> 00:10:36.798]  Good, that was quick guys, found that in 10 seconds.
[00:10:37.318 --> 00:10:45.084]  And then they go up to the north, up by Aleppo, and then that branches out into several different countries up there, and that's how
[00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:55.605]  The Islamic State has been taking over the country and it's being funded by Western groups in Saudi Arabia out of Iraq in the south and the east and then by
[00:10:56.778 --> 00:10:59.320]  Obviously, Turkey and others in the north.
[00:11:00.141 --> 00:11:02.903]  And Turkey's been giving them artillery support.
[00:11:03.143 --> 00:11:05.545]  I mean, you name it, it is a major war.
[00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.587]  Hundreds of thousands of Jihad troops.
[00:11:07.987 --> 00:11:21.499]  And I've talked to Colonel Schaefer years ago, confirming that he was at Capitol Hill in secret briefings, and that it would be coming out in the next few months that 90 plus percent of the, quote, rebels are al-Nusra slash al-Qaeda.
[00:11:22.352 --> 00:11:24.073]  And of course, it's still those numbers today.
[00:11:24.813 --> 00:11:27.134]  So there really are no non-radicals.
[00:11:27.494 --> 00:11:33.236]  They say they spent $600 million to train a thousand rebels, and they trained six of them.
[00:11:35.616 --> 00:11:37.337]  Well, that isn't a failed operation.
[00:11:37.717 --> 00:11:45.500]  It's that those are the pass-through to fence the weapons to Islamic State that is a caliphate being set up by Saudi Arabia.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.021]  I mean, Saudi Arabia has conquered Syria before.
[00:11:50.037 --> 00:12:01.620]  So, this is the same old war, yet again, and you've got poll numbers of international groups that have gone and polled people on the street in different cities, and over 80% support for Assad.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:11.962]  He was democratizing the country, he was working with the West, he was becoming a major tourist destination, and they used him lowering his guard, like with Qaddafi, to send in the jihadis.
[00:12:12.042 --> 00:12:13.703]  And I'm not saying Qaddafi was a good guy.
[00:12:14.543 --> 00:12:17.085]  Assad is a good guy compared to Qaddafi.
[00:12:17.625 --> 00:12:20.748]  Qaddafi is a good guy, if you really study it, compared to Islamic State.
[00:12:21.368 --> 00:12:26.172]  They are the worst of the worst, and Qaddafi was working with the West for seven, eight years.
[00:12:26.212 --> 00:12:29.094]  He invested tens of billions of dollars with Western companies.
[00:12:29.354 --> 00:12:35.799]  He let Halliburton and the French and just everybody else in, Schlumberger, you name it.
[00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:42.464]  He totally nationalized, he took the nationalized system and just gave it to the West, and then privatized it.
[00:12:43.479 --> 00:12:47.061]  And they stabbed him in the back and stole the Libyan money as well.
[00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:48.282]  Mainly the French.
[00:12:48.422 --> 00:12:50.023]  The French government stole tens of billions.
[00:12:50.043 --> 00:12:51.004]  He invested with France.
[00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:54.165]  He went and had dinner and hung out with the French president.
[00:12:54.206 --> 00:12:56.907]  He really got sucked in and set up.
[00:12:57.668 --> 00:13:01.050]  And said nice things about George Bush and nice things about Obama.
[00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.472]  And met Obama and they just totally stabbed him in the back.
[00:13:05.833 --> 00:13:07.714]  And people say, well he's a scumbag, let's stab him in the back.
[00:13:08.314 --> 00:13:09.435]  But who's even worse?
[00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:13.653]  The people that go in there and create a failed state.
[00:13:13.693 --> 00:13:16.095]  Now, that said, I've got so much news to cover here today.
[00:13:17.075 --> 00:13:33.427]  I was building up to some clips we're going to play in a few minutes of Obama saying that he would never, ever, ever, he said it over and over again, put boots on the ground.
[00:13:34.228 --> 00:13:35.949]  And that that would never happen.
[00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.272]  And now Obama is coming out
[00:13:42.549 --> 00:13:50.835]  Saying basically that he never said that, and they've got Kirby, one of their spokesmen, saying, I don't know that Obama ever ruled on boots on the ground in Syria.
[00:13:51.655 --> 00:13:56.679]  So this is the type of spin they're engaged in, and we've got the White House press secretary
[00:13:58.806 --> 00:14:01.727]  Trying to say he didn't break his promise.
[00:14:02.307 --> 00:14:06.209]  Just like saying we never said that you could keep your doctor.
[00:14:06.249 --> 00:14:07.449]  We never said it was free.
[00:14:07.849 --> 00:14:09.570]  We never said it cut the price in half.
[00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:16.953]  Just as they break the promises, they walk them back in a more and more really outrageous way.
[00:14:17.953 --> 00:14:26.216]  And so we've got links to, on Infowars.com, in a Zero Hedge article, 16 times Obama promised no boots on the ground in Syria.
[00:14:27.571 --> 00:14:30.333]  And there's this attitude by people that, well, that's just what they do, they lie.
[00:14:30.633 --> 00:14:40.018]  Yes, but we've reached a new level of constitutional fraud, of constitutional usurpation, of constitutional trampling, and of lying.
[00:14:40.058 --> 00:14:48.482]  And again, even liberal professors say Obama is three times worse than Bush on the Constitution, on freedom of the press, and on persecuting whistleblowers.
[00:14:49.463 --> 00:14:52.204]  There's no doubt that this country had political cancer.
[00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:54.646]  Now it's metastasized and
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.201]  Obama is basically above the law.
[00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:01.463]  So I want to play some of these clips first, then coming up.
[00:15:03.264 --> 00:15:07.447]  For the first time ever, a majority of Democrats now view socialism favorably.
[00:15:07.607 --> 00:15:08.328]  That's been the goal.
[00:15:09.028 --> 00:15:11.209]  Bill Gates, only socialism can save the planet.
[00:15:11.229 --> 00:15:11.870]  This is just today.
[00:15:13.697 --> 00:15:15.658]  And that ties into this report.
[00:15:15.698 --> 00:15:20.980]  The UN plans to implement universal biometric identification for all worldwide.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.300]  And that ties into last week's article.
[00:15:24.201 --> 00:15:25.461]  No bank card required.
[00:15:25.541 --> 00:15:27.862]  Citigroup testing eye scanners at ATMs.
[00:15:27.962 --> 00:15:28.742]  NBC News.
[00:15:30.243 --> 00:15:32.083]  So we're going to be getting into those reports.
[00:15:32.804 --> 00:15:36.405]  We're going to get into, obviously, the huge developments with Russia and nuclear weapons.
[00:15:37.345 --> 00:15:40.246]  We're going to get into the epidemic.
[00:15:40.786 --> 00:15:41.907]  And this is an epidemic.
[00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:48.511]  As I've looked at the crime numbers of police officers demanding sex from women they pull over.
[00:15:49.332 --> 00:15:57.434]  This has always happened some, but they've lowered the IQ thresholds, they've tried to hire sociopaths under many federal programs at local departments.
[00:15:58.454 --> 00:16:09.277]  They've put out psychological testing that gets these type of delusional people that think they're God and think that they're above the law, and they believe their order means a woman should have sex with them.
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.942]  Now, the police departments are also busting them and going after them.
[00:16:14.562 --> 00:16:20.586]  Because they realize this is, A, wrong, B, it'll destroy the public's confidence in the police 100%.
[00:16:21.407 --> 00:16:22.868]  But it is happening.
[00:16:22.988 --> 00:16:24.068]  It is going on.
[00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:27.631]  And it just shows the delusional nature of some of these guys.
[00:16:29.272 --> 00:16:34.595]  And you look at these cops, whether they're black, white, or Hispanic, they all just have this stupid look in their eye.
[00:16:35.296 --> 00:16:38.878]  It's just, I mean, you can see when a cop walks over how they look in the eyes, how they're going to act.
[00:16:39.957 --> 00:16:46.480]  I mean, if somebody's tough, confident, cool, and a good person, you can tell they're going to be a cool cop right away just by how they look.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.941]  But you see one of these wimpy looking people come over.
[00:16:48.961 --> 00:16:52.963]  It could be a female cop, it could be, everybody knows, it's like, oh God, here we go.
[00:16:53.484 --> 00:16:55.425]  These cops look like total wimps, look out.
[00:16:55.805 --> 00:16:57.886]  They got something to prove, we are in big trouble.
[00:16:59.321 --> 00:17:07.584]  And I look at the photos of these cops that have been convicted, pleading guilty, admitting to, well, sure, 10 women the last few months.
[00:17:07.804 --> 00:17:12.426]  They agreed to give me oral sex when I pulled them over for DWI.
[00:17:12.766 --> 00:17:15.067]  They're like, but you can't sit there and tell them to do it.
[00:17:15.347 --> 00:17:16.767]  You can't do that on duty regardless.
[00:17:16.787 --> 00:17:18.508]  They're like, yeah, yeah, I can.
[00:17:18.888 --> 00:17:21.989]  That's how delusional these people are on power trips.
[00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.010]  But it's across society.
[00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.451]  Society is degenerating.
[00:17:29.838 --> 00:17:38.584]  The only reason violent crime has gone down is so many hundreds of thousands the last 20 years of criminals have been shot to death by citizens and police, but mainly citizens.
[00:17:39.104 --> 00:17:44.968]  I've got statistics out today on that front that again it's more than cut in half since 92.
[00:17:45.369 --> 00:17:49.852]  New numbers have come in, the last two years have come in now, confirming what we got in 2013.
[00:17:50.232 --> 00:17:54.355]  Even more of a violent crime rate because the criminals are scared to death.
[00:17:55.814 --> 00:18:08.878]  To carjack somebody, or home invade, or try to tackle a woman who's jogging, because they know a lot of those women are carrying a .357 snub-nosed Smith & Wesson in their fanny pack.
[00:18:10.259 --> 00:18:16.644]  And so, congratulations to all the people out there packing and all the women really becoming in power, even though Gloria Steinem hates it.
[00:18:16.664 --> 00:18:19.686]  She wants to be on a government plantation, fully controlled by the scum.
[00:18:20.186 --> 00:18:24.549]  Good job, women, for going out, taking classes, getting armed, and taking this country back.
[00:18:24.569 --> 00:18:26.471]  In fact, so much of it is women getting armed.
[00:18:27.452 --> 00:18:29.593]  Absolutely want to clap and salute all of you out there.
[00:18:29.613 --> 00:18:30.434]  Fabulous job.
[00:18:31.014 --> 00:18:32.555]  That's what's going to stop these criminals.
[00:18:33.316 --> 00:18:37.059]  Meanwhile, he talked about it last weekend when he hosted the Sunday Show.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.161]  And I want to get more into it.
[00:18:39.181 --> 00:18:47.267]  In fact, I forgot to ask, will you guys print me Governor Abbott's letter to the dozens of law enforcement agencies in Texas that are engaged in treason?
[00:18:47.848 --> 00:18:49.309]  It sounds like George Washington wrote it.
[00:18:49.989 --> 00:19:00.357]  He's calling out all these operatives like the sheriff of Dallas, Lupe Valdez, who literally just legalizes illegals and lets them commit crimes, DWIs, no insurance.
[00:19:00.478 --> 00:19:04.301]  I mean, she is basically, might as well be an operative for Mexico City.
[00:19:04.881 --> 00:19:13.704]  She's the one that had the police, her deputies, attack us after the Dallas police let us into the 40th anniversary of JFK, talked to the police chief.
[00:19:14.024 --> 00:19:15.145]  We had a court ruling, we could do it.
[00:19:15.165 --> 00:19:16.585]  He said Dallas cops were great.
[00:19:18.106 --> 00:19:23.548]  The sheriff's department under orders just attacked us for no reason, including a seven-year-old girl they knocked off a father's shoulder.
[00:19:25.353 --> 00:19:26.674]  And I was like, you people are scum.
[00:19:26.754 --> 00:19:27.855]  I'm so ashamed of you to the police.
[00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:33.700]  And they're like, some of them were acting crazed and evil, but some of them were nodding their heads, were saying they were ashamed.
[00:19:34.461 --> 00:19:37.203]  To their credit, some of the black cops were saying they were ashamed of themselves.
[00:19:37.703 --> 00:19:46.310]  But it was just a big goon squad, like all the linebackers, white guys, black guys, you name it, just attacked a bunch of peaceful people under Lupe's orders.
[00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:49.312]  And the Dallas Police Department was just like, this is unbelievable.
[00:19:50.832 --> 00:19:51.893]  But she is a monster.
[00:19:52.133 --> 00:19:55.934]  I mean, she really is a little Benito Mussolini wannabe type.
[00:19:55.954 --> 00:19:56.614]  We'll get into that.
[00:19:57.095 --> 00:20:00.756]  Just a microcosm of all of this and more straight ahead.
[00:20:00.776 --> 00:20:03.157]  But first, Obama, no boots on the ground.
[00:20:03.197 --> 00:20:09.279]  Then Vladimir Putin, here's the big one, orders Russian Security Council to stockpile nuclear protective equipment.
[00:20:12.577 --> 00:20:16.798]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[00:20:17.218 --> 00:20:20.938]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[00:20:21.499 --> 00:20:22.739]  We typically do the same thing.
[00:20:22.879 --> 00:20:25.419]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[00:20:25.899 --> 00:20:27.520]  But have you considered heat storage?
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.900]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.000]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:33.981]  How will I keep my family warm?
[00:20:34.261 --> 00:20:36.701]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[00:20:36.741 --> 00:20:40.782]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[00:20:41.622 --> 00:20:42.343]  Another concern?
[00:20:42.743 --> 00:20:46.406]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[00:20:46.726 --> 00:20:48.988]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[00:20:49.308 --> 00:20:52.511]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:55.733]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[00:20:56.093 --> 00:21:00.056]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.

[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.741]  You'll never be cold again.

[00:22:09.321 --> 00:22:12.322]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[00:22:12.642 --> 00:22:17.783]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[00:22:18.124 --> 00:22:20.024]  But they're about to lose control.
[00:22:20.404 --> 00:22:25.386]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[00:22:25.706 --> 00:22:30.187]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:32.349]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:22:32.709 --> 00:22:36.212]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[00:22:36.553 --> 00:22:40.617]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[00:22:41.077 --> 00:22:46.602]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves, but this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:22:46.782 --> 00:22:48.163]  This will affect us all.
[00:22:48.644 --> 00:22:52.147]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.

[00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:06.302]  For thou art my rock and my fortress.
[00:24:06.562 --> 00:24:06.862]  Psalm 313.
[00:24:24.597 --> 00:24:27.599]  So, Barack Obama, the savior,
[00:24:48.228 --> 00:24:51.211]  Told us that he would never put boots on the ground in Syria.
[00:24:51.271 --> 00:24:52.492]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:24:53.312 --> 00:24:57.136]  For four plus years, there have been, quote, U.S.
[00:24:57.176 --> 00:25:04.742]  military and CIA advisors on the ground, and they are directly arming, it's come out in Congress, al-Nusra.
[00:25:04.782 --> 00:25:12.829]  That's why Reuters, a few weeks ago when Russia started its strikes a month ago, on September 29th,
[00:25:15.714 --> 00:25:24.300]  Came out and said, don't target the non-radical good rebels of Al-Nusra.
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:29.843]  And then Reuters went on to say, also known as Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[00:25:30.664 --> 00:25:31.144]  Close quote.
[00:25:32.605 --> 00:25:35.607]  And so there were headlines all over the country, all over the world, on the news.
[00:25:36.007 --> 00:25:37.268]  Don't bomb the good rebels.
[00:25:38.108 --> 00:25:40.210]  Don't bomb our little baby Al-Qaeda's.
[00:25:43.472 --> 00:25:45.013]  That's how stupid they think we are.
[00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:49.892]  And of course Russia hit them first because that was the command and control basis.
[00:25:50.872 --> 00:25:52.294]  And now they're going to put U.S.
[00:25:52.334 --> 00:25:54.455]  troops and are putting U.S.
[00:25:54.475 --> 00:26:06.806]  troops in that corridor, if we put the map back up for TV viewers, in that corridor out of Iraq that runs up the north of Syria where they can supply them through both sides to cut the country in two.
[00:26:08.112 --> 00:26:16.355]  and give the southeastern area to Iraq to form a new state that's now being pushed and promoted.
[00:26:16.755 --> 00:26:18.456]  That's Islamic State's little prize.
[00:26:19.777 --> 00:26:25.459]  And then western countries and others get the eastern half and the Mediterranean and the oil and the gas.
[00:26:26.359 --> 00:26:29.300]  There's also gas in the southeastern area.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.841]  And then the Kurds get the north.
[00:26:33.032 --> 00:26:39.056]  That is the carving up of the country, which is the admitted plan that Wesley Clark seven years ago exposed.
[00:26:40.237 --> 00:26:43.279]  They want to break Iraq in multiple parts, and now they're selling that in the news.
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:44.700]  We just got an idea.
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:54.207]  We want to break the country up in a whole bunch of different pieces, at least three pieces, to stop all the sectarian violence.
[00:26:54.247 --> 00:26:58.130]  When they went in, destabilized, broke it up, and then they have the nerve
[00:27:01.226 --> 00:27:03.847]  To claim that Russia is there destabilizing things.
[00:27:03.927 --> 00:27:04.907]  It is so criminal.
[00:27:05.507 --> 00:27:14.290]  But if you look at the current situation, the gray areas controlled by ISIS are being defeated.
[00:27:17.371 --> 00:27:25.014]  And so that's why US special forces are being put in to be basically human shields, hoping that the Russians end up killing some US troops.
[00:27:25.936 --> 00:27:38.602]  And then they can get on the news and say, you deserve to be now attacked and you deserve to leave Syria and we're now going to start bombing the Assad forces Russia and you better pull out.
[00:27:39.022 --> 00:27:41.623]  Hoping the American people get all stirred up and support that.
[00:27:41.883 --> 00:27:44.404]  But I think they are going too far.
[00:27:44.525 --> 00:27:45.725]  I think they're jumping the shark.
[00:27:46.585 --> 00:27:48.426]  Because Americans know ISIS is bad.
[00:27:48.867 --> 00:27:51.848]  They know this is in Russia's back door.
[00:27:54.051 --> 00:27:57.093]  They know that we're being lied to.
[00:27:58.254 --> 00:28:06.660]  They know, even if they're not politically informed, that that's Al-Qaeda because they've all seen Al-Qaeda for a decade plus waving those black flags with those exact symbols on them.
[00:28:07.101 --> 00:28:08.081]  It's like a football team.
[00:28:08.361 --> 00:28:10.063]  People know that's Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:13.005 --> 00:28:14.546]  And I just couldn't imagine being U.S.
[00:28:14.586 --> 00:28:17.248]  Special Forces, who I know got very upset.
[00:28:17.268 --> 00:28:18.449]  They told Tosh Plumley this.
[00:28:18.469 --> 00:28:19.630]  They told Colonel Schaefer this.
[00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.432]  They told other guests we've had on and guests we haven't had on.
[00:28:23.769 --> 00:28:25.910]  Three years ago, we will not fight for these people.
[00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:26.990]  We will not supply them.
[00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.151]  We will not give them weapons.
[00:28:28.171 --> 00:28:42.357]  These Al-Qaeda people, we're going to go to break and come back with the clips, are so arrogant that when they are at military bases or forward operating bases being given weapons off these C-130s that the Al-Qaeda people will smart off to the U.S.
[00:28:42.377 --> 00:28:47.719]  soldiers and say, you know, I killed some of you guys in Iraq and Afghanistan and we're going to kill more of you when we're done.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:50.580]  And the U.S.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.601]  military just sits there and listens to this
[00:28:54.761 --> 00:28:55.902]  And completely flip out.
[00:28:57.383 --> 00:28:59.144]  They've been made to train them in Jordan.
[00:28:59.624 --> 00:29:02.706]  They've been made to train them in Turkey.
[00:29:03.646 --> 00:29:23.339]  They have been made to train them in areas of Iraq, and they'll claim, here's the nice, you know, Harvard-trained jihadi leader who speaks English and is nice and talks nice to the Americans and gets the shipments, but then right over in the tents are a bunch of hardcore Wahhabist veteran fighters just spoiling to kill U.S.
[00:29:23.379 --> 00:29:23.659]  troops.
[00:29:25.777 --> 00:29:27.718]  And the military knows the truth about it.
[00:29:27.778 --> 00:29:36.702]  And as I said four years ago, if we can just get the message to them about what's really going on and expose all this, they'll never be able to pull all this off.
[00:29:36.762 --> 00:29:47.827]  So now they've gone to the next level to just order our troops in there to sit there like sitting ducks in that little corridor that ISIS now has split the country in two, hoping U.S.
[00:29:47.867 --> 00:29:48.627]  troops get killed.
[00:29:48.707 --> 00:29:50.468]  And I'm telling you, that's the false flag.
[00:29:51.869 --> 00:29:55.293]  Obama is the one that kills the US troops if the Russians bomb any of them.
[00:29:55.533 --> 00:29:57.336]  Obama is the one that put them in harm's way.
[00:29:57.556 --> 00:29:59.578]  Obama is the one using them as human shields.
[00:29:59.598 --> 00:30:00.139]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.639 --> 00:30:02.261]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.182 --> 00:30:05.866]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.009 --> 00:30:16.211]  Featured now at Infowars.com, for the first time ever, majority of Democrats now view socialism favorably.
[00:30:16.471 --> 00:30:26.975]  Doug Ross writes, the man currently running a distant second for the Democratic presidential nomination, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, is a self-declared socialist, and most of his party's voters now have a positive view of socialism.
[00:30:27.335 --> 00:30:35.878]  Socialism and the other offshoots of Marxism have failed in literally every venue it has been tried, despite progressive laughable efforts to claim certain countries have implemented it successfully.
[00:30:36.058 --> 00:30:38.839]  And let's look at the so-called success of European countries.
[00:30:39.159 --> 00:30:44.782]  Every one of them has rung up immense levels of unsustainable debt, thanks to the endless wealth redistribution schemes.
[00:30:45.162 --> 00:30:51.224]  Oh, and let's not forget, in the 20th century alone, communism led the way with the murders of 110 men, women, and children.
[00:30:51.484 --> 00:30:55.386]  But that's not stopping Bill Gates from saying, only socialism can save the planet.
[00:30:55.526 --> 00:31:00.649]  He added, without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or plant buyers to switch.
[00:31:00.969 --> 00:31:06.051]  Carbon taxes have been created to do only one thing, kill off the emerging country's populations.
[00:31:06.371 --> 00:31:09.415]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:31:09.775 --> 00:31:12.979]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:13.299 --> 00:31:21.308]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:21.528 --> 00:31:26.554]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:31:26.934 --> 00:31:29.236]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:31:29.456 --> 00:31:31.257]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:31:40.865 --> 00:31:42.946]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:31:43.046 --> 00:31:47.810]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:51.273]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:31:51.353 --> 00:31:54.555]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:31:54.835 --> 00:31:56.577]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:31:56.817 --> 00:31:57.698]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:31:57.718 --> 00:31:58.659]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:31:58.919 --> 00:32:00.801]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:10.312]  Alex Jones here.

[00:32:27.133 --> 00:32:28.695]  The globalists want us dependent.
[00:32:28.855 --> 00:32:30.357]  We need to be self-sufficient.
[00:32:30.457 --> 00:32:35.645]  And if you don't have high-quality, long-lasting, storable foods, I believe you're making a huge mistake.
[00:32:35.805 --> 00:32:38.288]  My goal is to find the best deals and bring it to you.
[00:32:38.508 --> 00:32:43.634]  Now is the time to take action and to secure your pantry for any emergency.

[00:32:55.106 --> 00:32:55.767]  We're good to go.
[00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:28.874]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:32.316 --> 00:33:39.780]  So the elite have calculated the public is so politically ignorant and illiterate
[00:33:41.738 --> 00:33:52.163]  That they can openly put Saudi Arabian Jihad forces into multiple countries at a time, wreck them, destroy them, murder tens of thousands of people every few months.
[00:33:52.283 --> 00:33:54.124]  Hundreds of thousands are dead in Syria alone.
[00:33:54.765 --> 00:33:56.486]  Upwards of 100,000 now in Libya.
[00:33:57.426 --> 00:33:59.527]  Admitted, quote, total failure of Hillary.
[00:33:59.807 --> 00:34:01.388]  And Iraq's a total failure.
[00:34:01.608 --> 00:34:02.729]  And everything else is a failure.
[00:34:02.929 --> 00:34:04.149]  And Afghanistan's a failure.
[00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:04.850]  No it's not!
[00:34:06.127 --> 00:34:14.273]  It's designed to destabilize the world, put the radicals in charge, make trillions of dollars on no-bid contracts, and spread radical Islam.
[00:34:15.914 --> 00:34:20.197]  By the way, if you put up on TV screen for radio listeners, you can go to InfoWars.com.
[00:34:20.237 --> 00:34:23.860]  We have the map up on screen there at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:34:25.697 --> 00:34:31.819]  You can see the areas controlled by Islamic State from the start of their, quote, invasion a year and a half ago until now.
[00:34:32.339 --> 00:34:35.000]  That's just a rebranding of Al-Qaeda under a new flag.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.321]  The same flag, different name.
[00:34:40.442 --> 00:34:46.944]  And you notice that that conduit goes up into the north out of Iraq, and that's where the, quote, refugees come in from.
[00:34:47.484 --> 00:34:54.247]  All over the world, radical Islamists just travel to Iraq, they're allowed in, and then they just simply, the Iraqi government admits this,
[00:34:55.666 --> 00:35:01.551]  Travel up into Syria and then travel from there as refugees into Europe.
[00:35:01.891 --> 00:35:11.739]  That's why upwards of 80% of the quote refugees are under the age of 30 and get off the trains and form up in military formations and follow their leaders.
[00:35:11.759 --> 00:35:14.902]  30 year old on average military officers.
[00:35:17.423 --> 00:35:36.848]  Once they get to refugee centers, they are then released and, quote, disappear by the thousands every day into the European culture, where the socialists place giant hog troughs in front of them for all the free government's slop as they arrogantly complain and demand more and more goodies.
[00:35:37.508 --> 00:35:38.929]  We're going to get to those clips in a moment.
[00:35:42.509 --> 00:35:44.410]  And then huge news on climate change.
[00:35:46.664 --> 00:35:50.328]  But first off, let's get to Obama's latest big broken promise.
[00:35:50.348 --> 00:35:51.909]  And it was always cynically broken.
[00:35:52.129 --> 00:35:53.611]  There were always boots on the ground.
[00:35:55.012 --> 00:35:57.635]  But now they need to tell you the boots are on the ground.
[00:35:59.517 --> 00:36:00.357]  For several reasons.
[00:36:00.417 --> 00:36:07.581]  To act like, because Putin is embarrassing Obama by taking out their Jihad forces, so now they have to act like they're actually fighting him.
[00:36:08.121 --> 00:36:18.527]  They were doing 13 sorties a day, the Russians are doing hundreds a day, now they've upped those to 20 or 30 quote bombing runs where they admittedly will bomb an old truck or bomb a whole house when no one's in it.
[00:36:19.868 --> 00:36:21.068]  Just complete theater.
[00:36:21.789 --> 00:36:24.390]  Absolute fog of war baloney.
[00:36:25.742 --> 00:36:28.903]  But the biggest reason isn't just the saving face.
[00:36:29.043 --> 00:36:30.304]  It is to put U.S.
[00:36:30.344 --> 00:36:36.886]  forces, and the Russians are saying this in official Russian media, and I don't just agree with them because they said so, but that's clearly what's going on.
[00:36:37.367 --> 00:36:38.627]  They're now announcing U.S.
[00:36:38.667 --> 00:36:55.134]  forces are there, so when they get killed, our media can say, our controlled media, the same ones that tell you two plus two equals five, the same ones that tell you it's normal to teach five-year-olds how to give oral sex, the same ones that tell you vaccines are safe and effective,
[00:36:56.292 --> 00:36:59.934]  I do not foresee a scenario in which boots on the ground in Syria, American boots on the ground in Syria, would
[00:37:23.766 --> 00:37:27.767]  Not only be good for America, but also would be good for Syria.
[00:37:29.087 --> 00:37:29.867]  My answer is simple.
[00:37:31.328 --> 00:37:34.328]  I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria.
[00:37:34.568 --> 00:37:35.168]  September 10th, 2013.
[00:37:35.648 --> 00:37:39.869]  I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan.
[00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:44.950]  I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo.
[00:37:45.991 --> 00:37:49.271]  This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective.
[00:37:50.592 --> 00:37:52.332]  Tonight I want to talk to you about Syria.
[00:37:53.291 --> 00:37:55.733]  Why it matters, and where we go from here.
[00:37:56.053 --> 00:37:57.434]  This is what he was trying to sell to the military.
[00:37:57.454 --> 00:38:06.059]  Over the past two years, what began as a series of peaceful protests against the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad has turned into a brutal civil war.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.221]  Over 100,000 people have been killed.
[00:38:09.381 --> 00:38:10.342]  By your forces.
[00:38:10.382 --> 00:38:11.783]  Millions have fled the country.
[00:38:12.624 --> 00:38:13.124]  Such a murderer.
[00:38:13.144 --> 00:38:20.889]  In that time, America has worked with allies to provide humanitarian support, to help the moderate opposition, and to shape a political settlement.
[00:38:22.079 --> 00:38:24.641]  But I have resisted calls for military action.
[00:38:25.401 --> 00:38:29.164]  Because we cannot resolve someone else's civil war through force.
[00:38:30.165 --> 00:38:32.306]  Particularly after a decade of war in Iraq.
[00:38:32.386 --> 00:38:33.747]  They funded the whole thing.
[00:38:34.188 --> 00:38:35.088]  He's a peacekeeper.
[00:38:35.188 --> 00:38:40.092]  I know that many of you are rightly concerned about any American military action in Iraq.
[00:38:40.112 --> 00:38:41.333]  Let's just give him a peace prize again.
[00:38:41.373 --> 00:38:42.514]  Limited strikes like these.
[00:38:43.374 --> 00:38:44.015]  I understand that.
[00:38:44.935 --> 00:38:48.498]  I ran for this office in part to end our war in Iraq and welcome our troops home.
[00:38:48.878 --> 00:38:49.619]  And that's what we've done.
[00:38:51.284 --> 00:38:55.768]  As Commander-in-Chief, I will not allow the United States to be dragged into another war in Iraq.
[00:38:56.108 --> 00:38:58.429]  It will take time to eradicate a cancer like ISIL.
[00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:01.572]  And anytime we take military action... It's 2014.
[00:39:01.612 --> 00:39:03.493]  ...there are risks involved.
[00:39:04.274 --> 00:39:07.716]  Especially to the servicemen and women who carry out these missions.
[00:39:07.756 --> 00:39:08.277]  That's enough.
[00:39:09.238 --> 00:39:11.159]  He goes on to say he promises they won't do it.
[00:39:11.459 --> 00:39:12.100]  There's 16 of them.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.141]  I'm not going to play them all.
[00:39:13.321 --> 00:39:13.881]  That's part of them.
[00:39:14.401 --> 00:39:15.502]  There's 16 video clips.
[00:39:15.522 --> 00:39:16.683]  There's more times he wrote it.
[00:39:17.904 --> 00:39:20.206]  Now they're out in the news saying he did never say that.
[00:39:21.391 --> 00:39:22.731]  That's clip number four I've got here.
[00:39:23.152 --> 00:39:24.852]  But let's go ahead and play Ash Carter.
[00:39:25.712 --> 00:39:28.173]  That's the Secretary of the Military.
[00:39:28.993 --> 00:39:29.674]  Secretary of Defense.
[00:39:30.254 --> 00:39:30.574]  U.S.
[00:39:30.794 --> 00:39:33.015]  will begin direct action on the ground.
[00:39:33.055 --> 00:39:34.395]  This is last Friday.
[00:39:35.035 --> 00:39:42.798]  Just in case they have Media Matters come out and say that Obama never said this and Ash Carter never said it and there's no call for world government.
[00:39:42.818 --> 00:39:43.438]  I mean, that's what they do.
[00:39:43.458 --> 00:39:44.878]  They just lie to their idiot readers.
[00:39:46.519 --> 00:39:49.360]  But let's go ahead and go ahead and play that clip for the record.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:49.680]  Here it is.
[00:39:50.666 --> 00:39:55.128]  The changes we're pursuing can be described by what I call the three R's.
[00:39:56.308 --> 00:39:59.590]  Raqqa, Ramadi, and Raids.
[00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:04.832]  The first R is Raqqa, ISIL's stronghold and administrative capital.
[00:40:06.012 --> 00:40:15.816]  We've been clear for some time that we need to keep up pressure on Raqqa and at that end we will support moderate Syrian forces fighting ISIL that have made territorial gains near Raqqa.
[00:40:15.896 --> 00:40:16.676]  Oh yeah, they sure have.
[00:40:16.696 --> 00:40:19.398]  Indeed, some of them are within 30 miles of Raqqa today.
[00:40:19.418 --> 00:40:19.618]  Oh no.
[00:40:20.698 --> 00:40:21.118]  ISIL is Sunni.
[00:40:21.138 --> 00:40:21.599]  Alright.
[00:40:50.714 --> 00:40:55.518]  Whether by strikes from the air... The only thing... Yeah, play the Emerson Strikes the Ground.
[00:40:55.558 --> 00:40:56.198]  Sorry, back it up.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.583]  It's just really hard to listen to this.
[00:41:04.025 --> 00:41:08.628]  And it is true they will end up killing some ISIS people because ISIS isn't fully controlled by the West.
[00:41:08.648 --> 00:41:13.132]  They just give them the weapons and then just let them run around murdering people.
[00:41:13.412 --> 00:41:16.134]  That's the problem they've had so long.
[00:41:17.616 --> 00:41:20.198]  Is that when they launched the nerve gas attacks twice
[00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.891]  against the Syrian capital.
[00:41:25.771 --> 00:41:30.173]  The jihadis wanted to be rock stars, so they videotaped the Saudi Arabian mortars.
[00:41:31.833 --> 00:41:35.675]  Where any weapons expert from Jane's Weapons Quarterly could tell you what it was, and they did.
[00:41:36.195 --> 00:41:42.557]  And they would Allah Akbar and wave their Al-Qaeda flags, and then, God is great, God is great, and fire these huge mortars.
[00:41:43.217 --> 00:41:50.580]  These, you know, 20-pound warhead mortars a mile away into markets to nerve gas people, and then run around and go,
[00:41:52.802 --> 00:42:07.866]  And so here's the CIA trying to launch a nerve gas attack through their surrogates, but their surrogates are so out of control and so stupid, they run around screaming Allah Akbar and praising, you know, praising the god of death or whatever, that they're nerve gassing markets.
[00:42:09.706 --> 00:42:12.867]  And then our media goes, Assad nerve gassed the markets!
[00:42:13.507 --> 00:42:20.889]  And Assad's like, I'm giving all my chemicals up, I'll do whatever you want, I'll even step down out of power, just take the Saudi Arabian troops out of the country.
[00:42:22.608 --> 00:42:24.070]  He wants to move to England and retire.
[00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:29.096]  He was trying to transition the government from his father, a dictator, out of that.
[00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:36.524]  And that's how evil this is to watch Ash Carter sit up there when they know full well
[00:42:37.335 --> 00:42:46.478]  They're there to reconstitute ISIS and bring in other groups and try to overthrow Assad and the government and the army, just like they did in Egypt for a year.
[00:42:46.498 --> 00:42:56.482]  And when they put the jihadis in charge of Egypt for a year, they blew up almost every church in the country, including some of the oldest churches outside of Israel or Syria.
[00:42:58.803 --> 00:42:59.463]  And remember that!
[00:42:59.503 --> 00:43:05.505]  We're conducting such missions directly, whether by strikes from the air or direct action on the ground.
[00:43:06.803 --> 00:43:08.244]  There you go, that's the Secretary of Defense.
[00:43:09.885 --> 00:43:13.208]  And I'm not being sarcastic when I say I'm playing that to prove this is happening.
[00:43:13.748 --> 00:43:20.313]  Because they will literally have Time Magazine or even the New York Times come out and say, crazy conspiracy theorists think they're boots on the ground.
[00:43:22.335 --> 00:43:23.856]  That's how dumb they think people are.
[00:43:23.896 --> 00:43:26.638]  Remember Obama said, I never said you could keep your doctor.
[00:43:26.838 --> 00:43:28.859]  We had like 25 clips of him saying it.
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.221]  I think it was 27 clips.
[00:43:33.543 --> 00:43:36.045]  This is the type of jacking with people's brains, like,
[00:43:37.486 --> 00:43:38.587]  Remember Goober?
[00:43:39.147 --> 00:43:39.668]  Or Uber?
[00:43:41.409 --> 00:43:42.410]  Jonathan Goober?
[00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.790]  Uber?
[00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:43.590]  What's his name?
[00:43:44.611 --> 00:43:45.172]  Yeah, Groober.
[00:43:45.792 --> 00:43:46.593]  I'm not being sarcastic.
[00:43:46.613 --> 00:43:56.080]  I can't remember all these scumbags' names sitting around on C-SPAN going, the public's such idiots, we were gonna triple prices, but they called me in to help deceive, and Obama loved my deception.
[00:43:58.541 --> 00:44:00.202]  I mean, I'm so sick of these people.
[00:44:01.744 --> 00:44:04.706]  There's 1.8 million Christians in Syria.
[00:44:05.899 --> 00:44:07.220]  There were around 3 million.
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:08.681]  And guess what?
[00:44:08.701 --> 00:44:14.164]  Of the 300,000 dead, there's a bunch of those are refugees and survived.
[00:44:14.504 --> 00:44:26.331]  But of the 300,000 that are dead, it's estimated over 100,000 Christians who were non-military were murdered, raped, tortured, killed.
[00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:35.516]  But if 3 people or 10 people get killed at some victim disarmament zone, Obama is going to be up there grandstanding on television.
[00:44:37.529 --> 00:44:45.992]  About the poor lives, and look at this woman, and look at this man, and look at this child, and humanizing who they were to make you feel bad.
[00:44:46.192 --> 00:44:59.697]  But when it's 100,000 Christians that they have butchered, and the UN admits persecution of Christians is at the highest level ever, and dwarfs all other persecutions combined.
[00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:16.328]  And our government that's persecuting Christians here at home and demonizing and having the IRS go after thousands of churches and all of it is funding persecution of Christians in Africa, in Asia, supporting China doing it, supporting it in the Middle East.
[00:45:16.608 --> 00:45:17.229]  It's incredible.
[00:45:17.289 --> 00:45:18.591]  They hate us.
[00:45:18.611 --> 00:45:20.954]  Remember the secret recording of Obama, the candidate?
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.983]  2007?
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.983]  He goes, listen, I'll get these better clingers.
[00:45:26.063 --> 00:45:27.904]  You get me in there, I know how to deal with them.
[00:45:28.524 --> 00:45:32.267]  They're clinging to their bibles, they're clinging to their guns, and they're our number one priority.
[00:45:32.767 --> 00:45:33.648]  To deal with them.
[00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:37.330]  They hate our guts.
[00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:38.351]  Have you figured that out yet?
[00:45:38.371 --> 00:45:42.394]  I mean, I know you know that, but people, you have to really get it through your head.
[00:45:45.011 --> 00:45:52.456]  That these are tyrants coming after us and they mean business and they are carving this country up in pieces in front of everyone right now.
[00:45:52.476 --> 00:45:53.397]  We cannot put up with it.
[00:45:56.879 --> 00:45:58.400]  I'm not going to play any more of the grilling.
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.403]  I may do some of this in the third hour after Michael Savage leaves us.
[00:46:01.763 --> 00:46:03.804]  NBC reporter grills Ernest.
[00:46:05.145 --> 00:46:08.267]  Didn't Obama effectively break his promise on trips going to Syria?
[00:46:08.568 --> 00:46:10.389]  As if we need a press secretary to admit that.
[00:46:13.305 --> 00:46:17.408]  We got Kirby saying, I don't know that Obama ever ruled on boots on the ground in Syria.
[00:46:17.588 --> 00:46:20.750]  He said, I will not send them while they were there.
[00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:23.131]  You know, the big lie is they were always there.
[00:46:23.852 --> 00:46:27.454]  That's how we know about Al Qaeda on the ground being funded by the government.
[00:46:27.674 --> 00:46:29.675]  We know it from the U.S.
[00:46:30.056 --> 00:46:30.876]  military.
[00:46:35.819 --> 00:46:36.640]  And I told you the U.S.
[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.500]  military is awake.
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:40.042]  They are wildly awake now.
[00:46:41.678 --> 00:46:43.840]  Let me tell you, the globalists really went too far.
[00:46:44.181 --> 00:46:52.870]  And they've had Council on Foreign Relations articles a year after I told you this, I'm just pointing out, I know what I'm talking about, saying that they've got a big problem with the U.S.
[00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:57.275]  military and the public learning that Al Qaeda is run by the West.
[00:46:58.757 --> 00:47:01.640]  And so they have all these PR functions where they act like they're battling them.
[00:47:03.374 --> 00:47:16.567]  I want to get into some really big news here with Russia that ties into all this, and I want to get into the move to arrest people that deny that climate change is man-made, and how that ties into what Putin's doing.
[00:47:17.768 --> 00:47:24.074]  I don't mean to be obsessed with Putin, he's just involved in everything now, and almost always on the right side, one of the only world leaders actually telling the truth.
[00:47:25.646 --> 00:47:31.511]  I see the comments all over, even on mainstream publications, comment sections from all over the world, that Putin is hope.
[00:47:32.532 --> 00:47:33.673]  That's a quote I see more and more.
[00:47:33.753 --> 00:47:34.614]  Putin is hope.
[00:47:36.315 --> 00:47:38.037]  And it doesn't say much about Putin, does it?
[00:47:38.077 --> 00:47:42.701]  What does it say about us that we have such scum running our country and running the West?
[00:47:42.721 --> 00:47:46.705]  I mean, Putin doesn't let radical Islamists into the country.
[00:47:47.425 --> 00:47:48.706]  Putin pays people to have kids.
[00:47:49.227 --> 00:47:51.309]  Putin doesn't teach five-year-olds how to blow jobs.
[00:47:51.329 --> 00:47:52.690]  I mean, I'm sorry to use that word.
[00:47:55.606 --> 00:47:56.867]  Putin's cut people's taxes.
[00:47:59.329 --> 00:48:00.591]  Putin's promoting Christianity.
[00:48:02.813 --> 00:48:03.894]  Putin's fighting Al Qaeda.
[00:48:06.176 --> 00:48:08.218]  They've been loosening gun laws in Russia.
[00:48:10.119 --> 00:48:13.783]  That just shows how unbelievably pathetic this country is.
[00:48:14.503 --> 00:48:17.226]  How overrun with complete trash we are.
[00:48:22.196 --> 00:48:23.897]  And I don't take pleasure talking about this.
[00:48:23.977 --> 00:48:25.438]  I'm ashamed for America.
[00:48:25.939 --> 00:48:27.660]  This country was the greatest country in the world.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:28.861]  We were exceptional.
[00:48:29.902 --> 00:48:33.524]  Exceptionally honorable, exceptionally strong, exceptionally inventive.
[00:48:35.085 --> 00:48:37.907]  Now we are exceptionally conquered by trash.
[00:48:39.148 --> 00:48:41.270]  And the wages of sin or death, you can just look.
[00:48:43.373 --> 00:48:49.078]  At what we've become, and just look at all the statistics from education to our health, to our families, we are a wreck!
[00:48:49.499 --> 00:49:00.789]  Because the people running things conquered us financially, they didn't conquer us physically, they wanted to conquer us to fully control us, and they have really sabotaged our culture and our society with social engineering.
[00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:04.373]  And it's time to become aware of it, and break with it, and say no to it!
[00:49:07.128 --> 00:49:07.768]  I'm going to go to break.
[00:49:07.789 --> 00:49:14.253]  I'm going to come back with Vladimir Putin orders Russian Security Council to stockpile nuclear protective equipment and the rest of the story.
[00:49:17.035 --> 00:49:21.258]  We are extending the special that was supposed to end yesterday because it's so popular.
[00:49:21.278 --> 00:49:24.381]  I don't know why it's popular.
[00:49:24.401 --> 00:49:24.881]  It's huge.
[00:49:24.921 --> 00:49:32.527]  The deep cleanse is going to be extended until Wednesday and it may even sell out by then, but I'm just going to extend it.
[00:49:33.939 --> 00:49:36.461]  You can get the bottle of Liver Shield and the Oxy Powder.
[00:49:36.501 --> 00:49:37.441]  Huge discount on that.

[00:49:40.843 --> 00:49:42.745]  And they're going to end Wednesday when the show ends at 2.
[00:49:42.805 --> 00:49:43.405]  That's it.
[00:49:43.525 --> 00:49:43.725]  Boom.
[00:49:43.765 --> 00:49:44.285]  It's over then.

[00:52:09.483 --> 00:52:12.165]  You heard the discussions all over the radio.
[00:52:12.385 --> 00:52:14.246]  You couldn't believe what you were hearing.
[00:52:14.626 --> 00:52:15.486]  You trusted them.
[00:52:15.726 --> 00:52:17.667]  How could you have not seen the signs?
[00:52:17.728 --> 00:52:18.808]  You felt betrayed.
[00:52:18.828 --> 00:52:19.929]  Outrage set in.
[00:52:20.129 --> 00:52:22.090]  Your emotions began to consume you.
[00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:23.671]  Then, nothing.
[00:52:23.891 --> 00:52:25.432]  Now they're talking football.
[00:52:25.472 --> 00:52:27.113]  Days turned to weeks and months.
[00:52:27.293 --> 00:52:28.633]  Then, you've forgotten.
[00:52:28.894 --> 00:52:29.754]  But they haven't.
[00:52:29.934 --> 00:52:31.055]  They're still monitoring.
[00:52:31.195 --> 00:52:32.536]  Your every move.

[00:52:39.355 --> 00:52:42.096]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:52:42.397 --> 00:52:45.018]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:52:45.038 --> 00:52:45.458]  Croix River.
[00:52:45.778 --> 00:52:46.439]  I loved my dad.
[00:52:46.819 --> 00:52:47.779]  But boy was he stubborn.
[00:52:48.019 --> 00:52:50.741]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:52:50.981 --> 00:52:51.481]  His excuse?
[00:52:51.841 --> 00:52:52.922]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:52:53.182 --> 00:52:54.463]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.

[00:54:05.659 --> 00:54:07.120]  That's survivalfoodalliance.com.
[00:54:21.846 --> 00:54:32.070]  Donald Trump, by the way, we have video of this, we're going to play it next hour, has challenged Obama, saying, is Syria policy bad news?
[00:54:32.650 --> 00:54:42.974]  Putting troops on the ground in harm's way, and the answer is back Russia and bombing them, join them in targeted strikes, which the Russians have asked for, and Carson has come out defending Obama's policy.
[00:54:43.925 --> 00:54:45.725]  By the way, Carson is a super smart guy.
[00:54:45.765 --> 00:54:47.786]  They attack him and say he's not really aware of politics.
[00:54:47.806 --> 00:55:01.569]  I think because you're busy being a brain surgeon all day, you know, he is not as informed as some of the other candidates, but I think he's better than Hillary Clinton, but it is not good to support Obama, obviously, in this policy.
[00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:08.351]  That's a big strike again against Carson, along with his forced inoculations BS.
[00:55:09.931 --> 00:55:11.652]  Trump is just better in
[00:55:12.912 --> 00:55:13.352]  Triplicate.
[00:55:13.653 --> 00:55:18.536]  I mean, if Trump delivers on what he acts like he is, he'll be a great president.
[00:55:19.517 --> 00:55:20.598]  Light years better than Hillary.
[00:55:21.939 --> 00:55:23.980]  The problem is, I think he could be double-crossing us.
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.701]  He could be working with the Bushes or Hillary.
[00:55:26.182 --> 00:55:28.784]  But he may get so big he double-crosses them.
[00:55:29.184 --> 00:55:33.287]  Can we just have somebody who doesn't want to wreck the country and wants to be a great nation again?
[00:55:33.307 --> 00:55:36.389]  I mean, Trump's saying what people really want to hear.
[00:55:36.409 --> 00:55:37.850]  Okay, let's get into Russia right now.
[00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:38.631]  This is so big.
[00:55:40.458 --> 00:55:42.059]  Then I'm going to get into Governor Abbott.
[00:55:42.099 --> 00:55:45.942]  Did you guys find Abbott's letter to sheriff departments and police departments?
[00:55:45.962 --> 00:55:47.083]  Because I need that.
[00:55:47.123 --> 00:55:48.103]  If not, David Knight's got it.
[00:55:48.143 --> 00:55:48.524]  He covered it.
[00:55:48.544 --> 00:55:50.345]  I mean, it's a week old.
[00:55:50.365 --> 00:55:51.746]  It's just that it's back in the news.
[00:55:52.726 --> 00:56:01.172]  And with a straight face, they're criticizing Democrats, Democrat sheriffs that deport anybody, including felons.
[00:56:01.192 --> 00:56:07.797]  So they act like the Travis County Sheriff and the Dallas County Sheriff, Lupe Valdez, is not tough enough.
[00:56:08.437 --> 00:56:12.180]  On the immigrants in the newspapers, when she just totally, they're above the law.
[00:56:13.221 --> 00:56:16.183]  And Abbott is warning her and others to stop engaging in criminal activity.
[00:56:16.803 --> 00:56:22.447]  Their answer will be to probably have the Justice Department try to indict, because that's who runs these departments, indict Governor Abbott.
[00:56:23.448 --> 00:56:26.270]  They've already indicted his Attorney General, who's a great guy as well.
[00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:27.691]  Now let's continue.
[00:56:28.191 --> 00:56:35.136]  Vladimir Putin orders Russian Security Council to stockpile nuclear protective equipment.
[00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:42.373]  President says country must be prepared for threats both in peacetime and, God forbid, in wartime.
[00:56:42.693 --> 00:56:45.615]  That is close quote as they move missiles up against the Russian border.
[00:56:46.035 --> 00:56:53.779]  Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his Security Council to assess Russia's readiness to survive a nuclear, chemical, or biological disaster and has told them to stockpile protective equipment.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:57:05.206]  The order was during one of Putin's regular meetings with the Council that is made up of heads of Russia's intelligence, defense, and law enforcement agencies, high-ranking ministers, and the Speaker of the Russian House of Parliament are also permanent members of the group.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.241]  So that's the Russian Security Council.
[00:57:08.701 --> 00:57:10.321]  Let's get into Al-Qaeda, what they're up to.
[00:57:11.542 --> 00:57:15.323]  Al-Qaeda chief urges militant unity against Russia in Syria.
[00:57:16.404 --> 00:57:21.766]  Are we not capable of stopping the fighting amongst ourselves so we can direct all our efforts against them?
[00:57:21.806 --> 00:57:26.008]  And of course this guy, known to work Al-Zawahiri for the CIA.
[00:57:26.068 --> 00:57:26.728]  Truly shameful.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:31.061]  Clapper says ISIS might be capable of shooting down aircraft.
[00:57:31.081 --> 00:57:31.962]  Haven't gotten to that yet.
[00:57:32.402 --> 00:57:34.383]  ISIS took credit for the disaster on Twitter.
[00:57:34.763 --> 00:57:35.403]  Was it a missile?
[00:57:35.423 --> 00:57:36.004]  Was it a bomb?
[00:57:36.164 --> 00:57:36.604]  Obviously.
[00:57:36.864 --> 00:57:42.267]  Planes don't blow up in mid-air and then strewn themselves over miles by themselves.
[00:57:42.347 --> 00:57:48.270]  I mean, an engine can blow, get on fire, maybe a wing breaks off if it's going too fast downward in a spiral.
[00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:50.291]  They don't break up into a bunch of pieces.
[00:57:50.851 --> 00:57:52.251]  That's what all the experts are saying.
[00:57:52.652 --> 00:57:53.992]  I told you they got Stinger missiles.
[00:57:54.152 --> 00:57:57.314]  Was that that or an altitude-timed Mercury device?
[00:57:58.661 --> 00:58:00.181]  Russian plane crash in Sinai.
[00:58:00.221 --> 00:58:03.262]  Questions swirl as 224 aboard are mourned.
[00:58:03.622 --> 00:58:07.183]  Islamic State claims to have shot down Russian airliner over Sinai.
[00:58:08.044 --> 00:58:10.684]  Evidence reveals bomb took down Russian flight over Sinai.
[00:58:10.965 --> 00:58:12.165]  Curt Nemo gives his take.
[00:58:12.245 --> 00:58:12.825]  Breaks it down.
[00:58:13.805 --> 00:58:14.786]  Infowars.com.
[00:58:15.146 --> 00:58:15.366]  U.S.
[00:58:15.406 --> 00:58:16.666]  terror state invades Syria.
[00:58:16.726 --> 00:58:18.607]  Uses chemical weapons, bombs, hospitals.
[00:58:18.967 --> 00:58:20.647]  Lies that Russia's bombs hospitals.
[00:58:21.748 --> 00:58:22.848]  Washington blog breaks it down.
[00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:27.148]  A mass migration crisis and it may get worse.
[00:58:27.488 --> 00:58:28.548]  Now get ready for these headlines.
[00:58:28.848 --> 00:58:32.570]  German village of 102 braces for 750 asylum seekers.
[00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:37.851]  German schools abolish Christian festival to avoid offending Muslim migrants.
[00:58:38.272 --> 00:58:41.473]  Government to build 60 new houses for migrants while poor Germans are evicted.
[00:58:41.973 --> 00:58:46.094]  Migrants sing jihadist songs as refugee center ignorant Germans volunteers applaud.
[00:58:46.114 --> 00:58:47.855]  That's just part of today's news.
[00:58:47.875 --> 00:58:48.335]  Stay with us.
[00:58:50.908 --> 00:58:52.311]  Tell friends and family, tune in now.
[00:58:52.672 --> 00:58:53.273]  Send them links.
[00:58:53.734 --> 00:58:54.636]  InfoWars.com.
[00:58:55.418 --> 00:58:55.678]  Do it.
[00:58:55.718 --> 00:58:55.979]  Do it.
[00:58:56.039 --> 00:58:56.259]  Fight.
[00:58:56.339 --> 00:58:56.560]  Fight.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:56.820]  Fight.
[00:58:57.021 --> 00:58:57.402]  Resist.
[00:58:57.462 --> 00:58:57.782]  Awaken.
[00:58:59.656 --> 00:59:02.878]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:59:03.179 --> 00:59:11.205]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:11.425 --> 00:59:16.448]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:59:16.849 --> 00:59:19.130]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:59:30.717 --> 00:59:32.818]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:59:32.918 --> 00:59:37.659]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:41.040]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:59:41.201 --> 00:59:44.402]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:59:44.682 --> 00:59:46.482]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:59:46.662 --> 00:59:50.683]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.

[01:00:01.816 --> 01:00:04.435]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.936 --> 01:00:16.576]  Big Brother.
[01:00:17.257 --> 01:00:18.278]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:19.018 --> 01:00:20.119]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:21.580]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.361 --> 01:00:23.261]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.902 --> 01:00:27.524]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.105 --> 01:00:32.148]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:38.403]  By the way, Michael Savage is either going to be on tomorrow or Thursday.
[01:00:38.423 --> 01:00:40.064]  We have tomorrow kind of booked.
[01:00:40.084 --> 01:00:41.725]  He wanted to come on tomorrow now instead of today.
[01:00:42.786 --> 01:00:47.189]  But we kind of have tomorrow's show with Colonel Schaefer coming on and a bunch of other guests.
[01:00:47.209 --> 01:00:49.030]  But I think we can get Savage in in the first hour.
[01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:51.232]  He'll either be on tomorrow or he'll be on Thursday.
[01:00:52.092 --> 01:00:53.133]  Savage had to reschedule.
[01:00:53.153 --> 01:00:55.735]  Look forward to having him on, obviously with all the stuff that's going on.
[01:00:56.215 --> 01:00:59.097]  We're just going to open the phones up in this hour, end of the third hour today.
[01:00:59.938 --> 01:01:01.899]  We have a lot of special reports we're going to be getting to.
[01:01:01.919 --> 01:01:07.141]  We're going to get into the geopolitical issues.
[01:01:07.181 --> 01:01:13.184]  We're going to get into the incredible developments on climate change and global government and why that's so important.
[01:01:13.724 --> 01:01:18.866]  Also, a lot of news where concealed carry is still driving crime down around the country.
[01:01:19.367 --> 01:01:22.208]  Violent home invasions and carjackings and muggings.
[01:01:23.396 --> 01:01:26.380]  Now, non-violent crimes are actually ticking up.
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:28.742]  When I say non-violent, they break in your car when you're not there.
[01:01:29.223 --> 01:01:34.809]  But the criminals are a lot more careful about targeting people physically, because they know they can get blown away.
[01:01:37.272 --> 01:01:41.057]  So, police concealed carry license holder kills armed gunman.
[01:01:42.839 --> 01:01:55.068]  In Chicago, they've just now, six years after the Supreme Court DC v. Heller case, they've been forced to back off partially and allow, if you jump through a bunch of hoops, to have concealed carry.
[01:01:56.549 --> 01:02:02.013]  And so, more and more, we've actually seen the violent crime rate, for the first time in a decade, go down a little.
[01:02:02.334 --> 01:02:11.961]  Still, Chicago's very violent in some areas, like the South Side, obviously, it has some problems, but the criminals are getting more and more scared, so that is certainly, certainly good news.
[01:02:13.359 --> 01:02:14.580]  But I wanted to air this piece.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.341]  It's kind of a satire piece.
[01:02:16.762 --> 01:02:18.683]  Saw some of the comments on YouTube, thought it was serious.
[01:02:18.703 --> 01:02:20.765]  Like, they really think we're dumb.
[01:02:20.785 --> 01:02:21.825]  This is staged.
[01:02:22.766 --> 01:02:26.449]  Where they're talking about we need to get a Hillary for prison shirt.
[01:02:26.989 --> 01:02:27.830]  It's a joke.
[01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:29.111]  And I know most of you know that.
[01:02:29.151 --> 01:02:31.192]  Maybe folks are giving us their own satire.
[01:02:31.853 --> 01:02:32.793]  But it's a funny little piece.
[01:02:32.853 --> 01:02:33.674]  It's two minutes long.
[01:02:34.134 --> 01:02:36.956]  And I want to play this piece that Joe Beggs and Jakari Jackson put together.
[01:02:36.997 --> 01:02:37.317]  Here it is.
[01:02:38.436 --> 01:02:38.996]  Oh, hey.
[01:02:39.536 --> 01:02:39.716]  Sorry.
[01:02:39.736 --> 01:02:44.658]  I was just admiring the brand new shipment of Hillary for Prison 2016 t-shirts.
[01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:45.898]  We just got them in on the back.
[01:02:45.958 --> 01:02:48.519]  It says InfoWars.com Legalize Freedom.
[01:02:49.079 --> 01:02:51.080]  Everybody here is super excited today.
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:55.341]  No one wants that woman to become the President of the United States.
[01:02:55.361 --> 01:02:56.242]  Whoa!
[01:02:56.262 --> 01:02:56.582]  Look at this.
[01:02:57.242 --> 01:02:59.044]  DeCorey Jackson even has his on!
[01:02:59.444 --> 01:03:04.928]  What a coincidence that we would wear the same t-shirt on the same day.
[01:03:04.968 --> 01:03:08.131]  That's a very nice jacket you have on there, Biggs, as well.
[01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:17.839]  Yeah, when we're talking about this Hillary for Prison t-shirt that's only $19.95 at the Info Wars store, it reminds me of just the kind of
[01:03:18.799 --> 01:03:20.101]  Or of Mrs. Clinton.
[01:03:20.481 --> 01:03:23.885]  Because of course we know she lied about being shot at by sniper fire.
[01:03:23.905 --> 01:03:26.007]  You know, Brian Williams had a similar lie.
[01:03:26.308 --> 01:03:36.258]  Not to mention the Hoban-Ghazi scandal, where she was alerted to the plight of Ambassador Stevens, but instead of sending aid to Ambassador Stevens, she actually took that aid away.
[01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:39.422]  And, Gerald, I'm noticing something right there on your hip.
[01:03:39.442 --> 01:03:40.142]  What do you have there?
[01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:42.984]  Oh, this is something that Hillary Clinton doesn't like.
[01:03:43.664 --> 01:03:45.005]  This is a gun.
[01:03:45.785 --> 01:03:51.128]  Hillary Clinton doesn't want you to have the ability to protect yourself if someone wants to hurt you.
[01:03:51.348 --> 01:03:52.548]  There's crazy people out there.
[01:03:52.708 --> 01:03:54.709]  Well, you know, Joe, there are crazy people out there.
[01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:58.411]  So for that reason right there, I keep mine right here handy as well.
[01:03:58.631 --> 01:04:01.032]  So I guess you can just not like that, Hillary.
[01:04:01.372 --> 01:04:02.032]  Well, guess what?
[01:04:02.393 --> 01:04:05.434]  Go pick up your Hillary for Prison t-shirt and piss off a liberal.
[01:04:05.854 --> 01:04:08.456]  Let's go see what the rest of the crew's doing here at the InfoWars studio.
[01:04:08.676 --> 01:04:11.337]  So occasionally you're going to run into a friend that doesn't have a t-shirt.
[01:04:11.618 --> 01:04:13.138]  Rob, where is your shirt at?
[01:04:13.158 --> 01:04:13.619]  That's right.
[01:04:14.259 --> 01:04:15.240]  No, wrong shirt.
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.582]  That's why you buy multiple Hillary for Prison t-shirts.
[01:04:18.602 --> 01:04:19.863]  You can help out a buddy in need.
[01:04:20.223 --> 01:04:22.644]  But be prepared like this guy and have yours on.
[01:04:22.824 --> 01:04:24.105]  Darren, be prepared.
[01:04:24.685 --> 01:04:25.786]  Darren, always prepared.
[01:04:26.106 --> 01:04:31.930]  Make sure you go to the InfoWars store and pick up your Hillary for Prison t-shirt and show your disapproval today.
[01:04:35.473 --> 01:04:36.034]  I love Joe.
[01:04:36.094 --> 01:04:40.158]  He is just always a hard charger, just doing little promos to help fund the operation.
[01:04:40.598 --> 01:04:42.100]  He also loves the Hillary for President shirt.
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:45.683]  You've got less than a month and a half to order it by the 16th or 17th.
[01:04:46.184 --> 01:04:49.407]  Or at least the 18th, but they've asked me to stop saying it so they can get it all out on the 18th.
[01:04:49.687 --> 01:04:56.814]  We've got to get everything out by December 18th for Christmas to guarantee under USPS or even UPS that you get it a few days before Christmas.
[01:04:57.195 --> 01:04:57.896]  So if you want this
[01:04:58.456 --> 01:04:59.477]  Limited edition shirt.
[01:04:59.957 --> 01:05:00.577]  It's available.
[01:05:00.697 --> 01:05:01.618]  It's navy blue.
[01:05:01.638 --> 01:05:02.578]  Looks like a campaign shirt.
[01:05:03.018 --> 01:05:05.079]  It's lots of fun to engage in the First Amendment.
[01:05:05.359 --> 01:05:06.080]  Get yours today.
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:08.761]  Speaking of attack on the First Amendment, we're going to break it down straight ahead.
[01:05:09.793 --> 01:05:13.358]  What exactly is political correctness, and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[01:05:13.558 --> 01:05:19.625]  Well, political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses to control public opinion.
[01:05:19.726 --> 01:05:28.677]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda, but to also ensure that your government-created viewpoint also influences others in ripple effect.
[01:05:28.897 --> 01:05:31.179]  This is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[01:05:31.339 --> 01:05:34.962]  They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple.
[01:05:35.183 --> 01:05:38.726]  And, over time, we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception.
[01:05:38.886 --> 01:05:42.069]  But how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[01:05:42.269 --> 01:05:50.656]  Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth.
[01:05:50.817 --> 01:05:52.298]  Such as global warming, for example.
[01:05:52.478 --> 01:06:01.403]  Then the establishment suppresses any counter-arguments to their agenda by calling critics kooky, nutjobs, racists, or in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[01:06:01.663 --> 01:06:08.007]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and our YouTube channel, Resistance News.
[01:06:08.167 --> 01:06:09.368]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[01:06:09.648 --> 01:06:10.528]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:06:10.588 --> 01:06:10.988]  Good, brother.

[01:06:12.889 --> 01:06:14.649]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:06:14.829 --> 01:06:18.810]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:21.431]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:06:21.471 --> 01:06:23.712]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.

[01:06:46.852 --> 01:06:49.213]  Concentrated or maximum potency.
[01:06:49.373 --> 01:07:01.337]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[01:08:11.209 --> 01:08:16.262]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:16.642 --> 01:08:18.928]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:22.992 --> 01:08:27.795]  Now coming up in this hour, Michael Savage is now on with us tomorrow in the first hour.
[01:08:28.295 --> 01:08:34.518]  We've moved Michael Savage, he needed to move it, syndicated talk show, best-selling author, to tomorrow during the first hour.
[01:08:34.558 --> 01:08:35.679]  He will not be joining us today.
[01:08:36.339 --> 01:08:40.962]  We have Dr. Jerome Corsi tomorrow joining us on the economy, on ISIS, on Russia.
[01:08:41.382 --> 01:08:42.383]  We have Colonel Schaefer.
[01:08:43.203 --> 01:08:49.147]  Formerly ran Stratus Ivy and Abel Danger, the program to kill Al Qaeda operatives for the U.S.
[01:08:49.247 --> 01:08:49.467]  Army.
[01:08:49.887 --> 01:08:55.611]  He was ordered to stand down and not take out Al Qaeda twice when they knew where bin Laden was residing.
[01:08:56.792 --> 01:08:59.514]  He of course has helped expose Benghazi and so much more.
[01:09:00.461 --> 01:09:08.385]  And he's involved with private and governmental military groups, with a lot of really classified stuff he obviously won't be talking about here on air.
[01:09:09.226 --> 01:09:14.648]  But he will be telling us what he can tell us, not that we don't already pretty much know what's going on, thanks to him and others.
[01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:17.170]  He will be joining us tomorrow as well, so...
[01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:20.331]  Savage, Schaefer and Corsi tomorrow.
[01:09:20.371 --> 01:09:24.034]  That will be a big Tuesday worldwide transmission.
[01:09:24.694 --> 01:09:26.535]  So definitely join us for that.
[01:09:27.016 --> 01:09:31.398]  And of course there's the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock Central Time, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:09:33.159 --> 01:09:36.781]  Coming up, I want to get into the Texas Tribune article.
[01:09:37.222 --> 01:09:38.282]  Breitbart has a story.
[01:09:38.743 --> 01:09:43.786]  Sanctuary City policies will no longer be tolerated in Texas, says Governor Abbott.
[01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:52.997]  And my problem with this is, I've talked to prosecutors, it's been in the news, police chiefs have admitted it.
[01:09:53.057 --> 01:09:56.700]  In 800 plus cities, well that's counting a bunch of towns, they say it's 400 plus major cities.
[01:09:58.622 --> 01:10:01.304]  400 places that are above, you know, 50,000.
[01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:04.967]  Where they don't arrest them for DWI's.
[01:10:05.928 --> 01:10:08.530]  I've talked to Austin cops, they go, yeah, judges let them go for $10 fines.
[01:10:10.678 --> 01:10:13.140]  Everybody knows you get hit by an illegal without insurance.
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:14.620]  The insurance companies don't do anything.
[01:10:15.301 --> 01:10:17.202]  I've been hit by an illegal.
[01:10:18.282 --> 01:10:20.964]  And the police came and they just said, no insurance, blah, blah, blah.
[01:10:21.024 --> 01:10:22.785]  And the guy wrote him a ticket, but nothing happened.
[01:10:23.726 --> 01:10:25.407]  And the insurance company just said, oh, whatever.
[01:10:25.427 --> 01:10:26.767]  We're not going to go after him.
[01:10:26.807 --> 01:10:27.248]  We can't.
[01:10:27.528 --> 01:10:28.829]  And then I got hit on my insurance.
[01:10:29.309 --> 01:10:31.430]  I was rear-ended in a parking lot like 10 years ago.
[01:10:32.491 --> 01:10:39.315]  And it's just crazy to see the government throw the book at citizens, regardless of what color you are.
[01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:42.330]  We're seen as the big fat chumps.
[01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:43.351]  We're seen as dinner.
[01:10:43.411 --> 01:10:45.531]  We're seen as here to be fed on.
[01:10:46.751 --> 01:10:47.611]  But not the illegals.
[01:10:47.651 --> 01:10:51.072]  But I have a personal beef with Lupe Valdez.
[01:10:53.212 --> 01:10:54.533]  With the Dallas Sheriff's Department.
[01:10:54.733 --> 01:11:07.755]  And what happens when sheriffs and mayors build their own little third world kingdoms and tell the illegals, come here, basically vote for me, get on the social services, and then it's all basically racially based.
[01:11:11.923 --> 01:11:12.403]  It's crazy.
[01:11:13.664 --> 01:11:16.245]  But what are the Mexicans going to do when it's Chinese?
[01:11:16.285 --> 01:11:22.788]  The Chinese at current rates, by 2025, if you look at different census numbers, Chinese immigrants will dwarf Mexicans.
[01:11:24.529 --> 01:11:27.071]  And they again operate together, unified in a group.
[01:11:27.651 --> 01:11:29.392]  The truth is, every culture works together.
[01:11:29.412 --> 01:11:32.974]  The Jews work together, the Chinese work together, the Mexicans work together.
[01:11:33.314 --> 01:11:34.875]  Who's been trained not to work together?
[01:11:36.255 --> 01:11:36.776]  Europeans.
[01:11:36.996 --> 01:11:37.436]  Westerners.
[01:11:39.702 --> 01:11:44.085]  And my issue is, I refuse to be controlled in a balkanization and put in a group.
[01:11:46.467 --> 01:11:55.293]  I want to promote a culture, a Bill of Rights, free association, private property, and then we're all in that cult.
[01:11:55.433 --> 01:11:59.136]  Because humans are always going to be in a cult, they're always going to be in a gang, we are tribal.
[01:11:59.476 --> 01:12:07.442]  Well, let's sell the idea of freedom, and 1776 is our tribe, and prosperity, and freedom, and family.
[01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:13.071]  And by the way, that sells with a lot of these immigrants.
[01:12:13.791 --> 01:12:19.534]  They're just being force-fed the balkanization and being told, everyone hates you, you poor thing.
[01:12:19.574 --> 01:12:21.535]  You didn't get enough anchor baby money.
[01:12:21.555 --> 01:12:22.916]  You didn't get a nice enough car.
[01:12:23.196 --> 01:12:26.317]  You didn't get all these things you needed, you poor little sweetie cake.
[01:12:26.798 --> 01:12:30.760]  We're sorry the white people are so racist, Joe Biden, Barack Obama say.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.100]  We're sorry they hate you.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:32.380]  Really?
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:38.864]  69% of Hispanics, wide spectrum poll, including illegals, don't want open borders?
[01:12:38.904 --> 01:12:39.464]  No kidding!
[01:12:41.829 --> 01:12:43.690]  It's a fundamental fairness issue.
[01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:45.951]  You can't go to Mexico and get something free.
[01:12:45.991 --> 01:12:47.912]  You can't go to Guatemala and get something free.
[01:12:48.172 --> 01:12:51.634]  You can't go to Chile or El Salvador and get something free.
[01:12:51.654 --> 01:12:57.716]  So we're going to get to that and Governor Abbott's amazing letter from October 26th.
[01:13:00.518 --> 01:13:03.179]  And then I want to read Breitbart, which hits it on the head.
[01:13:03.359 --> 01:13:04.399]  And I'm not just saying this, I agree with it.
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.620]  This is an accurate article.
[01:13:06.536 --> 01:13:10.758]  I'm an expert on what's going on with sanctuary cities, especially Dallas, my hometown.
[01:13:11.718 --> 01:13:15.240]  I've been brutalized by her sheriff's deputies for no reason.
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:19.322]  I mean, she's a thug.
[01:13:19.342 --> 01:13:22.783]  It's on video.
[01:13:26.405 --> 01:13:29.967]  And then it ties into Beijing has covert radio networks in the US.
[01:13:30.107 --> 01:13:30.387]  Oh, yeah.
[01:13:30.407 --> 01:13:33.708]  Let me tell you, I've dealt with major censorship from the Chinese government.
[01:13:34.188 --> 01:13:35.169]  And so has Michael Savage.
[01:13:37.082 --> 01:13:39.923]  And if you criticize radical Islam, they'll ban you from entering Europe now.
[01:13:40.023 --> 01:13:41.404]  I mean, this is really going on.
[01:13:41.424 --> 01:13:43.805]  And I'm going to get to that coming up in your phone calls.
[01:13:45.286 --> 01:13:46.746]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:13:46.766 --> 01:13:46.807]  800-259-9231.
[01:13:46.847 --> 01:13:48.527]  Now, I genuinely care about Muslim people.
[01:13:48.547 --> 01:13:49.648]  I genuinely am not an Islamophobe.
[01:14:03.855 --> 01:14:16.582]  I genuinely understand that there is a divide-and-conquer strategy going on, and that most people from the Middle East simply want a chance to be prosperous and to live the American dream.
[01:14:17.962 --> 01:14:28.528]  But the immigrants being brought in, that were brought into Syria from all over the Muslim world, from Chechnya to Saudi Arabia, from Iraq to North Africa,
[01:14:30.225 --> 01:14:33.046]  are coming there to sow their oats, rape, rob, and murder.
[01:14:33.507 --> 01:14:36.828]  Eighty percent or more of the people coming into Europe are military-age men.
[01:14:37.168 --> 01:14:43.952]  They post pictures of themselves on Facebook and Twitter, you know, once they get into Germany, saying, hey baby, I'm ready to party with them with rocket launchers.
[01:14:44.832 --> 01:14:48.574]  That's their culture of this particular group, Wahhabis, to show off.
[01:14:49.814 --> 01:14:55.697]  And they're being allowed to come in to then commit terrorist crimes, and then they're going to take Europeans' rights, not the jihadis'.
[01:14:56.397 --> 01:14:58.999]  They're going to say, take down your churches, take down your steeples,
[01:15:00.126 --> 01:15:03.489]  Shut them down, don't wear short skirts, you offend the Muslims, it's your fault.
[01:15:03.729 --> 01:15:04.850]  And that's already happening.
[01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:10.034]  See, they teach you under political correctness to give up your culture, lay down and be run over.
[01:15:12.676 --> 01:15:16.800]  And it's the same breakdown of the broken strategy, the divide and conquer.
[01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:25.847]  Where you break the culture into a hundred parts and then the government itself glues them back together, but they're the glue that controls you.
[01:15:27.811 --> 01:15:29.252]  They're the shackles that bind you.
[01:15:29.933 --> 01:15:51.813]  And I know everybody gets this, but we're really seeing at a diabolical level millions and millions a year of people brought in and then a red carpet rolled out as a reverse psychology to just totally go for broke where people just become flabbergasted and get in a fetal position and go into a catatonic state.
[01:15:54.278 --> 01:16:08.610]  But I see mainstream news articles in Germany and in other countries of Europe with a straight face where the radical Islamists say, I want a car, I want a job, I want a paycheck now, a house isn't enough.
[01:16:10.109 --> 01:16:13.972]  And by the way, your daughters are going to do what we say, and we're here to take over.
[01:16:14.252 --> 01:16:16.574]  This is how arrogant these people are, because they have nothing.
[01:16:17.035 --> 01:16:22.259]  But as military-age men from these cultures, they're not embarrassed that they're there wanting handouts.
[01:16:22.519 --> 01:16:25.622]  They flip the script and just get super demanding.
[01:16:27.315 --> 01:16:29.396]  And they have German school kids catering to them.
[01:16:29.657 --> 01:16:32.639]  They're kicking old people out of government housing, putting the illegals in there.
[01:16:33.479 --> 01:16:35.961]  They are taking down church steeples.
[01:16:35.981 --> 01:16:48.669]  I mean, every day I see straight-faced articles going, we believe the main central church, by the way, taken over years ago by the government, needs to have the steeple taken down because it's offensive.
[01:16:49.290 --> 01:16:57.115]  And we're going to house the migrants in there, and with their imam, we're going to make it more comfortable and put a moon, a crescent moon on the top.
[01:16:58.917 --> 01:17:00.139]  Actually, I have the articles right here.
[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:04.965]  And with a straight face, they have to rub the Germans' noses in it.
[01:17:05.886 --> 01:17:09.891]  That's why they have governors and stuff going, you don't like 4,000 people in your town of 3,000?
[01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:11.713]  Leave!
[01:17:11.873 --> 01:17:12.734]  People are like, how dare you?
[01:17:12.754 --> 01:17:14.096]  And they're like, that's right, leave!
[01:17:17.088 --> 01:17:18.929]  Because it's all about breaking their will.
[01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:23.451]  A mass migrant crisis, and it may get worse, is the headline, New York Times.
[01:17:23.971 --> 01:17:26.612]  And it shows just the columns of thousands pouring in.
[01:17:27.072 --> 01:17:31.014]  German village of 102 braces for 750 asylum seekers.
[01:17:31.394 --> 01:17:34.295]  The German village is told, you will accept them, you will pay for them.
[01:17:35.415 --> 01:17:41.938]  And by the way, women, you need to stop wearing, and again, as soon as the women start
[01:17:42.813 --> 01:17:47.998]  Wearing the long pants, the long skirts, next it's, I want to put a little something around your face.
[01:17:48.678 --> 01:17:54.944]  The political correct now are actually, as a sacrament against the West, it's now fashionable in Germany that women are now doing it.
[01:17:55.284 --> 01:17:58.187]  I submit, I bow, I do what the socialists say.
[01:17:58.687 --> 01:18:01.210]  Norway, immigrants brutally gang rape 14 year old girl.
[01:18:01.690 --> 01:18:03.071]  One gets off of community service.
[01:18:03.291 --> 01:18:03.672]  Boom!
[01:18:05.133 --> 01:18:06.594]  Sodomized her as she begged.
[01:18:06.634 --> 01:18:07.075]  They admit it.
[01:18:10.908 --> 01:18:15.910]  Latest headline, German school abolishes Christian festival to avoid offending Muslim migrants.
[01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:16.250]  St.
[01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:21.491]  Martin's Day celebration amended to facilitate the quote integration, close quote, of asylum seekers.
[01:18:21.932 --> 01:18:28.574]  Primary schools and kindergartens in Germany are abolishing the Christian celebration and changing it to a generic festival of lights.
[01:18:28.634 --> 01:18:29.454]  That will not please.
[01:18:30.214 --> 01:18:35.016]  So, as not to offend the hundreds of thousands of Muslim migrants pouring into the country.
[01:18:35.276 --> 01:18:37.877]  According to the translated report from Epoch Times,
[01:18:38.857 --> 01:18:41.358]  Schools are renaming the Christian-themed St.
[01:18:41.438 --> 01:18:46.721]  Martin's Day an annual celebration that takes place in numerous European countries November 11th.
[01:18:48.302 --> 01:18:56.166]  Several daycare centers in Dusseldorf have abolished the festival altogether out of consideration for the refugees.
[01:18:56.506 --> 01:19:02.469]  See, political correctness means you give up your culture, you assimilate to whatever culture the globalists say.
[01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:05.551]  And if they can get you to accept radical Wahhabist Islam,
[01:19:08.148 --> 01:19:14.250]  Which I've seen these Wahhabist men, they put on gangster outfits in Europe and go, yeah baby, come on, yeah.
[01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:16.710]  And it's like, Mohammed says I can rape you.
[01:19:16.770 --> 01:19:21.271]  I mean, it's like weird gangster stuff mutates with all this Mohammed stuff.
[01:19:21.331 --> 01:19:22.932]  I mean, it is just crazy.
[01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:27.833]  And then to see the left all just getting so excited.
[01:19:31.754 --> 01:19:34.395]  By the way, I went to my cousin's birthday party.
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:36.541]  I'm going to skip the network break.
[01:19:36.561 --> 01:19:37.441]  I have to do it, then I'm going to stop.
[01:19:38.121 --> 01:19:39.542]  I went to my cousin's birthday party.
[01:19:39.562 --> 01:19:45.346]  It was like a day before Halloween, but it was a costume party.
[01:19:45.366 --> 01:19:46.006]  You know, that's fun.
[01:19:46.026 --> 01:19:55.712]  And I was wearing a captain's hat because he rented a boat when we went out on Lake Austin with a bunch of people and music and drove around.
[01:19:56.312 --> 01:19:58.614]  And then I went back and it was actually a party.
[01:19:58.654 --> 01:20:00.275]  He rented a big condo downtown.
[01:20:02.529 --> 01:20:26.532]  And once at the condo, but also once at a restaurant slash bar, because we were a bunch of places, I had a white guy once, and then a white girl another time, I said two times, actually three times, and then a guy that looked like he was Arab, I didn't ask him, come up to me, and I'm out there on the balcony, beautiful night sky, watching a drone fly around,
[01:20:28.251 --> 01:20:29.491]  And he says, what are you?
[01:20:29.511 --> 01:20:31.632]  So a couple of us were wearing captain's hats.
[01:20:31.652 --> 01:20:32.733]  We're going to go out on a boat.
[01:20:32.753 --> 01:20:35.333]  So we just went to the store like $2 a piece and got a captain's hat.
[01:20:35.353 --> 01:20:38.074]  I think they were $4, something like that.
[01:20:38.254 --> 01:20:39.435]  And I'm like, what is that?
[01:20:39.455 --> 01:20:41.856]  And I turn and I look at him.
[01:20:42.836 --> 01:20:44.036]  He goes, what is that, Nazi?
[01:20:44.957 --> 01:20:46.397]  He goes, I'm offended by Nazis.
[01:20:47.798 --> 01:20:49.898]  And I went, are you, are you joking?
[01:20:49.918 --> 01:20:50.739]  You think this is a Nazi hat?
[01:20:50.779 --> 01:20:51.499]  I said, yeah, it is.
[01:20:51.679 --> 01:20:53.020]  I turned around and squared up to the guy.
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.060]  I said, yeah, it is a Nazi hat.
[01:20:55.523 --> 01:20:56.204]  Got a problem with it?
[01:20:56.664 --> 01:20:57.685]  What if it was a Nazi hat?
[01:20:58.065 --> 01:20:59.266]  Why can't I dress up like World War II?
[01:20:59.926 --> 01:21:01.147]  But you know it's not a Nazi hat.
[01:21:01.347 --> 01:21:10.054]  You want to show off in front of these women right here with your cultural superiority and henpeck me to act like I've done something wrong as an act of aggression by you.
[01:21:11.855 --> 01:21:15.418]  And this whole cultural jihad that's getting pushed by the left.
[01:21:16.879 --> 01:21:17.740]  Isn't that what it's about?
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.522]  He goes, actually, I kind of agree with you.
[01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:21.142]  I guess you're right.
[01:21:21.583 --> 01:21:22.203]  I went, oh good.
[01:21:22.803 --> 01:21:23.384]  Have a nice night.
[01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:38.749]  There was a blonde college girl who literally was going around saying, I just didn't want to wear any costume because of my white guilt.
[01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:41.271]  I don't want to offend anybody.
[01:21:42.052 --> 01:21:42.852]  We're like, great.
[01:21:43.253 --> 01:21:44.674]  So this is how mentally ill people are.
[01:21:46.035 --> 01:21:49.177]  There are people going around all over the place.
[01:21:50.478 --> 01:21:51.459]  So mentally ill.
[01:21:52.472 --> 01:21:56.113]  That they're going, I'm so guilty what I'm wearing it might offend someone.
[01:21:56.133 --> 01:21:58.834]  I better not wear anything and telling everyone about it.
[01:21:59.194 --> 01:22:06.376]  And then I had a white guy and an Arab guy separately at the restaurant slash bar come over and say, what's that hat?
[01:22:07.596 --> 01:22:09.397]  And I went, oh no, this isn't happening again.
[01:22:09.417 --> 01:22:10.937]  I said, what's it look like?
[01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:15.591]  I thought maybe he's being friendly and he goes, I don't know, looks kind of fascist.
[01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:19.412]  No, but really it's a classic police hat style captain hat.
[01:22:19.432 --> 01:22:20.932]  It's like a 20s, 30s, 40s hat.
[01:22:21.092 --> 01:22:23.153]  It's an officer's hat.
[01:22:24.193 --> 01:22:24.853]  That's what it is.
[01:22:26.854 --> 01:22:29.715]  And I said, oh, look, that lady's wearing a black leather jacket and black pants.
[01:22:29.735 --> 01:22:30.815]  You know, is she a Nazi too?
[01:22:34.465 --> 01:22:36.306]  But this is what it's like.
[01:22:36.406 --> 01:22:38.466]  It's they're ready for their political red terror.
[01:22:38.766 --> 01:22:39.767]  They're ready to come.
[01:22:39.807 --> 01:22:40.707]  They're ready to dominate.
[01:22:40.727 --> 01:22:41.527]  They're ready to boss.
[01:22:42.067 --> 01:22:44.068]  This is their high and mighty.
[01:22:44.108 --> 01:22:45.088]  This is their high horse.
[01:22:45.148 --> 01:22:46.329]  This is their better than you.
[01:22:46.809 --> 01:22:48.709]  This is their culturally pure and you're not.
[01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:53.591]  And the answer is... Get out of my face.
[01:22:53.831 --> 01:22:54.771]  You are the fascists.
[01:22:56.472 --> 01:22:57.092]  You're a joke.
[01:22:59.133 --> 01:23:00.453]  Is there something wrong with you?
[01:23:02.014 --> 01:23:02.894]  What's your problem?
[01:23:05.011 --> 01:23:06.192]  But you don't like free speech.
[01:23:06.832 --> 01:23:08.534]  But it's worse than that.
[01:23:08.554 --> 01:23:11.176]  I wasn't wearing a German military uniform.
[01:23:13.738 --> 01:23:16.900]  But see, they're banning selling German military memorabilia.
[01:23:17.041 --> 01:23:23.025]  They're even trying to ban World War I stuff, saying that might offend and engage your girls and being dressed like cowboys.
[01:23:24.887 --> 01:23:26.228]  That offends rural groups.
[01:23:26.288 --> 01:23:26.868]  No, it doesn't.
[01:23:26.968 --> 01:23:27.889]  You say it does.
[01:23:27.989 --> 01:23:29.971]  You say you speak for everyone.
[01:23:29.991 --> 01:23:32.393]  You say you are the cultural gods.
[01:23:34.133 --> 01:23:36.395]  You say you decide what the culture is.
[01:23:36.435 --> 01:23:38.256]  That's the ultimate form of a cult.
[01:23:38.376 --> 01:23:39.737]  It's the ultimate form of tyranny.
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:57.191]  But then when you have one of the most insensitive, abusive, dominating, wicked, Wahhabist, radical Sunni takeovers in the world, taking over Shiite Islam, taking over Alawite Islam, taking over
[01:23:58.863 --> 01:24:04.705]  Sufi Islam taking over all the other forms of it and murdering Christians.
[01:24:06.306 --> 01:24:08.207]  You don't hear a word out of the controlled left.
[01:24:08.547 --> 01:24:16.650]  All you have is this lip-licking by these ignorant weirdos that have a fetish over any culture that doesn't bow down to their political correctness.
[01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:19.611]  So because it doesn't bow down, they immediately bow.
[01:24:19.631 --> 01:24:22.593]  You know what I found all three times I told people they were pathetic?
[01:24:22.613 --> 01:24:24.533]  I mean, it went more than that.
[01:24:24.613 --> 01:24:26.014]  I chewed both these guys out.
[01:24:28.723 --> 01:24:30.944]  One guy apologized and said, he goes, I guess you're right.
[01:24:31.164 --> 01:24:37.868]  The other guy acted kind of weird and I said, hey, don't get in people's faces and try to engage in cultural Marxism and think that somebody can get back in your face.
[01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:43.791]  And I shouldn't brag and act tough, but I told him, you better get out of my face now.
[01:24:49.754 --> 01:24:50.795]  Because I'm through with these people.
[01:24:53.136 --> 01:24:53.657]  I'm through with them.
[01:24:56.424 --> 01:25:01.706]  She's a college student, she's 21, about to graduate with her first degree, and she was just walking around all depressed.
[01:25:01.726 --> 01:25:06.188]  And it turned out she talked to my personal trainer who was at the party, friends with Buckley, and told him the same thing.
[01:25:06.889 --> 01:25:08.750]  Walking around just going, uh, with this depressed look.
[01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:09.490]  People are like, what's wrong?
[01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:11.531]  She's like, I just have white guilt.
[01:25:11.611 --> 01:25:14.712]  I mean, these are mental patients.
[01:25:14.832 --> 01:25:17.033]  And the thing is, I wasn't looking for them.
[01:25:17.073 --> 01:25:17.854]  They're out there.
[01:25:19.104 --> 01:25:29.148]  Remember the Atlantic Monthly article a few weeks ago about the deliberate dumbing down and how there's all these liberal mentally ill basket cases and how they're afraid of everything and have anxiety attacks being around people?
[01:25:29.388 --> 01:25:31.329]  They can't be in social circles.
[01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:43.254]  They can't communicate because they've been in public school for 14, 15, 16 years, 12 years of, you know, primary, and then four years of college, and all they are is immersed in a bunch of unwind!
[01:25:47.396 --> 01:25:49.037]  Oh, that cap looks scary!
[01:25:49.177 --> 01:25:51.298]  Oh my gosh, you're wearing a blue cap!
[01:25:51.519 --> 01:25:52.679]  He's wearing a white one!
[01:25:52.699 --> 01:25:53.620]  Now there's the headline.
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.501]  The coddling of the American mind.
[01:25:56.962 --> 01:25:58.783]  And then it gets so scary, what do they want?
[01:25:58.943 --> 01:25:59.943]  Ban free speech.
[01:26:00.084 --> 01:26:02.485]  Ban anything that scares them.
[01:26:02.505 --> 01:26:04.126]  And that leads us now to this new article.
[01:26:06.047 --> 01:26:07.248]  Back to the Dark Ages.
[01:26:07.288 --> 01:26:08.328]  That's what I've been calling this.
[01:26:10.114 --> 01:26:10.895]  Very important article.
[01:26:11.635 --> 01:26:13.497]  Top French weatherman.
[01:26:14.257 --> 01:26:15.358]  See, that was even politically incorrect.
[01:26:15.378 --> 01:26:17.440]  He should have been a weather person, even though he is a man.
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:19.461]  See, this is how far this goes.
[01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:20.802]  Back to the Dark Ages.
[01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:22.103]  Top French weatherman.
[01:26:22.143 --> 01:26:22.624]  Weatherman.
[01:26:22.644 --> 01:26:23.024]  Weatherman.
[01:26:23.044 --> 01:26:23.364]  Weatherman.
[01:26:23.384 --> 01:26:23.644]  Weatherman.
[01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:24.425]  Weatherman.
[01:26:24.505 --> 01:26:25.045]  Weatherman.
[01:26:25.106 --> 01:26:25.586]  Weatherman.
[01:26:25.886 --> 01:26:26.807]  Back to the Dark Ages.
[01:26:27.047 --> 01:26:28.288]  Top French weatherman.
[01:26:28.768 --> 01:26:30.570]  Fired over climate change book.
[01:26:31.758 --> 01:26:36.200]  The popular weatherman announced Saturday evening that he has been sacked by leading French news channel.
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:39.761]  He can just get his own feed, blue screen, and talk about the weather himself and do subscriptions.
[01:26:39.781 --> 01:26:40.442]  It'll be more popular.
[01:26:40.902 --> 01:26:51.286]  He has been sacked by the leading French news channel, France Televisions, for publishing a book which accused top climate change experts of misleading the world about the threat of global warming.
[01:26:52.186 --> 01:26:55.148]  Oh my gosh, he wrote The Climate Investigation.
[01:26:55.188 --> 01:26:58.289]  Let's get Philippe Verdner on.
[01:27:00.370 --> 01:27:07.834]  He's a household name in France for his daily weather reports on France's Channel 2 announced an online video that he had received a letter of dismissal.
[01:27:11.916 --> 01:27:14.877]  But listen, your new dark age, your new inquisition is going to fail.
[01:27:15.117 --> 01:27:16.358]  The stinking sun!
[01:27:16.418 --> 01:27:17.759]  I shouldn't say so bad things about the sun.
[01:27:18.119 --> 01:27:18.879]  Thank you God for the sun.
[01:27:20.202 --> 01:27:26.607]  Then, of course, the UN voted and said it doesn't affect climate, like sticking your arm in a fireplace when it's on doesn't burn your fingers.
[01:27:26.667 --> 01:27:27.828]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:27:28.108 --> 01:27:31.091]  Or putting a hot pot of water on a flame doesn't heat it up.
[01:27:32.512 --> 01:27:35.674]  But they said, no, it's all humans, you're bad, you're evil, pay us carbon taxes.
[01:27:37.656 --> 01:27:38.917]  All scientists agree it's real.
[01:27:39.117 --> 01:27:42.120]  First it's cooling, then warming, now it's change, period.
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:47.404]  And now they go, things are getting cold, it's the cooling, things are getting warm, pay carbon taxes.
[01:27:48.064 --> 01:27:49.666]  Getting colder means we're warming!
[01:27:51.718 --> 01:27:54.619]  Now they're saying, we never said it was warming, we said it was change.
[01:27:54.939 --> 01:27:56.580]  Oh, now you control change.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.421]  See, language, the Earth, it's them playing God.
[01:28:02.742 --> 01:28:06.683]  Russian media take climate cue from skeptical Putin, New York Times.
[01:28:06.743 --> 01:28:07.984]  No, Putin's not skeptical.
[01:28:09.076 --> 01:28:19.146]  Putin's broken with the West completely because they've encircled Russia and he says they want to turn off Russia's industry and not let them sell oil and gas and put taxes on them, which is only part of it.
[01:28:19.166 --> 01:28:20.607]  They want a post-industrial world.
[01:28:20.807 --> 01:28:24.350]  And he goes on to say it is war, military action against humanity.
[01:28:24.691 --> 01:28:25.592]  Yes, that's what it is.
[01:28:25.612 --> 01:28:27.714]  And I told you on Friday that was uber big.
[01:28:27.914 --> 01:28:28.274]  It is big!
[01:28:30.759 --> 01:28:34.603]  And that's why they've got the EU and the French government now calling for arresting.
[01:28:34.764 --> 01:28:38.728]  And by the way, they've set up a secret climate court for the UN.
[01:28:39.309 --> 01:28:40.851]  They've now leaked the section last week.
[01:28:40.931 --> 01:28:42.092]  New American Magazine got it.
[01:28:43.994 --> 01:28:46.137]  It was reported on by big newspapers over the weekend.
[01:28:46.157 --> 01:28:47.598]  DrudgeReport.com linked to it.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.281]  Let's put that up on screen.
[01:28:50.381 --> 01:28:50.902]  Headline.
[01:28:51.162 --> 01:28:51.623]  Headline.
[01:28:53.251 --> 01:29:02.475]  Inside TPP is secret UN court for climate criminals and deniers, and the sections say it's going to go after your speech.
[01:29:03.776 --> 01:29:06.117]  They want to arrest us, people.
[01:29:07.157 --> 01:29:15.221]  These are hard core totalitarians, and they've got masses of people now that'll walk up to you and go, what's that hat?
[01:29:15.241 --> 01:29:15.741]  You a Nazi?
[01:29:17.082 --> 01:29:17.582]  I don't like that.
[01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:22.010]  The whole story was, what you got against Jews?
[01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:25.292]  I was just like, I didn't even go, I'm sorry, sir.
[01:29:25.312 --> 01:29:26.772]  I went, yeah, it is Nazi.
[01:29:27.753 --> 01:29:28.573]  That is, yeah.
[01:29:29.474 --> 01:29:30.595]  Yes, you bet it is, yeah.
[01:29:31.755 --> 01:29:32.636]  I told him more, too, man.
[01:29:32.696 --> 01:29:35.858]  I just said, I don't want to tell people how nasty I get, man.
[01:29:35.898 --> 01:29:36.418]  I just wish that...
[01:29:38.583 --> 01:29:43.406]  I'm sick of people pushing their guilt on me when I hadn't done nothing to you, you filth!
[01:29:44.247 --> 01:29:48.670]  Projecting onto me all your sick fantasies of control, you garbage!
[01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:52.953]  Just try to take my guns, try to take my kids, try to forcibly inoculate me.
[01:29:53.193 --> 01:29:56.355]  I'm here rallying the troops worldwide to prepare for you.

[01:29:59.157 --> 01:30:00.117]  We're on the march.

[01:33:21.467 --> 01:33:24.088]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:24.108 --> 01:33:31.572]  All right, here is the toll-free number to join us on any of the issues I've raised.
[01:33:31.632 --> 01:33:35.814]  The huge developments for Russia says they're openly preparing to survive a nuclear war.
[01:33:37.330 --> 01:33:44.715]  The radical islamicists, most of them military-age men, just running around raping, killing, attacking, demanding everything free.
[01:33:45.335 --> 01:33:47.776]  Old Germans being thrown out of government housing to house them.
[01:33:48.677 --> 01:33:51.919]  Christian festivals in towns and schools being cancelled.
[01:33:52.839 --> 01:33:56.402]  Oktoberfest, people being told don't drink out on the streets.
[01:33:57.282 --> 01:34:04.627]  The radical islamicist videos from England to Germany and to France, running around telling women not to walk around scantily clad.
[01:34:05.307 --> 01:34:07.608]  Well, they'd really have a heart attack in downtown Austin on Halloween.
[01:34:08.828 --> 01:34:10.369]  Just, just crazy!
[01:34:10.809 --> 01:34:14.070]  And again, then we're supposed to adapt to their ways.
[01:34:16.091 --> 01:34:20.272]  I mean, conservative Americans have to put up with folks that want to run around wild because we're a free country.
[01:34:20.292 --> 01:34:26.054]  I mean, imagine if Christians were running around telling women to wear, you know, hoods on their heads.
[01:34:27.819 --> 01:34:29.601]  It's simply over the top.
[01:34:30.161 --> 01:34:34.745]  Government to build 60 new houses for migrants while poor Germans are evicted.
[01:34:35.525 --> 01:34:38.068]  Migrants sing jihadist songs at refugee centers.
[01:34:38.088 --> 01:34:38.668]  There's video.
[01:34:39.008 --> 01:34:40.870]  Ignorant German volunteers applaud.
[01:34:40.890 --> 01:34:42.611]  And they don't like you.
[01:34:42.651 --> 01:34:43.652]  They think you're pathetic.
[01:34:44.633 --> 01:34:47.055]  Thousands of Muslim migrants disappear from camps.
[01:34:47.075 --> 01:34:47.956]  That's WorldNet Daily.
[01:34:50.057 --> 01:34:50.438]  Look at this.
[01:34:50.858 --> 01:34:51.479]  Facebook.
[01:34:52.119 --> 01:34:52.840]  Sky News.
[01:34:56.069 --> 01:35:03.215]  Pay migrants for every hate post the German yellow press newspaper Bild is publishing the names of offenders in the media.
[01:35:04.236 --> 01:35:06.218]  So if you criticize the open borders, they publish your names.
[01:35:06.558 --> 01:35:17.848]  Meanwhile, Hungary Prime Minister accuses Soros of stoking refugees... Stoking the refugee raids... I'm having Freudian slips here.
[01:35:18.388 --> 01:35:23.072]  Hungarian Prime Minister accuses Soros of stoking refugee wave to weaken Europe.
[01:35:23.132 --> 01:35:23.733]  Really think so?
[01:35:26.897 --> 01:35:31.080]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[01:35:32.221 --> 01:35:34.283]  I've got some Second Amendment news I want to hit here in a moment.
[01:35:34.323 --> 01:35:38.926]  But first, I want to give out the toll-free number 800-259-9231.
[01:35:38.946 --> 01:35:49.635]  And then coming up, for the first time ever, a majority of Democrats now view socialism favorably.
[01:35:50.902 --> 01:35:51.743]  Mission accomplished!
[01:35:51.763 --> 01:35:56.527]  Remember Newsweek saying, we're all socialists now and how everything's going to be free and how wonderful it's going to be?
[01:35:56.567 --> 01:36:00.651]  And you notice, we now have less than 1% with like 87% of the wealth.
[01:36:00.671 --> 01:36:05.736]  And it's a tiny percentage of that percent.
[01:36:05.996 --> 01:36:10.801]  And the more you get socialism, the more there'll be a giant mass of poor, stupid people.
[01:36:11.991 --> 01:36:12.872]  And they won't know any better.
[01:36:13.753 --> 01:36:20.921]  Meanwhile, Bill Gates, whose wealth is basically a state secret, and who has over $100 billion in tax-free foundations that he makes profits off of.
[01:36:21.502 --> 01:36:26.187]  Bill Gates, only socialism can save the planet without a substantial carbon tax.
[01:36:26.488 --> 01:36:28.230]  There's no incentive for innovators.
[01:36:28.330 --> 01:36:28.750]  Oh, really?
[01:36:28.770 --> 01:36:31.434]  I thought there was no carbon tax.
[01:36:33.464 --> 01:36:38.207]  He always goes and speaks to academics and teachers groups and tells them about all the free stuff they're going to get.
[01:36:38.667 --> 01:36:42.749]  You know, if we don't give an old lady health care, we can give 10 of you a raise.
[01:36:43.049 --> 01:36:43.649]  They all clamp.
[01:36:43.770 --> 01:36:44.690]  Yeah.
[01:36:45.170 --> 01:36:45.711]  Yeah.
[01:36:45.751 --> 01:36:47.432]  He wants to give you some free stuff.
[01:36:47.492 --> 01:36:51.254]  If you just accept the IBM computers.
[01:36:51.714 --> 01:36:52.874]  He's like, he's Microsoft.
[01:36:52.894 --> 01:36:53.435]  It doesn't matter.
[01:36:53.715 --> 01:36:57.377]  The IBM computers deciding to kill the old lady.
[01:36:58.539 --> 01:37:00.260]  Isn't he such a sweet man?
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:03.621]  He wants to give you something free.
[01:37:06.603 --> 01:37:13.766]  Meanwhile, remember that major banks like Citigroup are coming out and saying they want you to retina scan to buy and sell?
[01:37:14.226 --> 01:37:19.808]  Well, now the UN's openly announced that's what they're coming up with, so we're going to get into that report as well.
[01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:27.472]  But I've just got to tell you, the big news is that
[01:37:28.769 --> 01:37:32.652]  People are waking up to just how dire the situation is.
[01:37:33.513 --> 01:37:48.625]  And even a sizable minority that starts to say no to these political takeovers, and who speak out to others, and who vote with their dollars, and vote with their feet, and vote with their actions, not supporting the top 100 Fortune 100 corporate systems, we will bring these people down.
[01:37:49.446 --> 01:37:58.848]  And it doesn't mean you've got to be a purist, doesn't mean you've got to be perfect about what you do, but I would only shop and support mom-and-pops, locals, and groups that are anti-globalist.
[01:37:59.409 --> 01:38:08.531]  And I would do your research, and I would militarily only spend your money with organizations and groups and systems that are promoting freedom.
[01:38:09.071 --> 01:38:24.907]  And I would let other organizations like Monsanto, McDonald's, Microsoft, Apple, and others that promote gun control and open borders, and the big beer makers that do it as well, that you're not going to be supporting them because of their traitorous globalist activities.
[01:38:26.469 --> 01:38:32.035]  You got the big corporations setting up a world government they run to rob the daylights out of us.
[01:38:33.976 --> 01:38:39.338]  To drive down our wages and create a giant third world hell with no stairway out of it.
[01:38:42.599 --> 01:38:46.161]  And then once they've got everybody poor, they can engage in organized population reduction.
[01:38:48.061 --> 01:38:55.044]  And of course, I'll also get into Governor Abbott and Sanctuary City's policies will no longer be tolerated in Texas and tie it into his letter that I want to read on air.
[01:38:55.064 --> 01:38:56.124]  I'm going to really try to do that.
[01:38:56.665 --> 01:39:00.286]  Also, the most dangerous volcano in North America is roaring to life.
[01:39:02.722 --> 01:39:05.103]  We're going to get to that report and a lot of other tectonic activity.
[01:39:06.043 --> 01:39:06.243]  U.S.
[01:39:06.323 --> 01:39:09.244]  Army tests swans of drones in major exercise.
[01:39:11.084 --> 01:39:12.745]  That is just some of the news that's coming up.
[01:39:13.405 --> 01:39:27.429]  Briefly before I go any further here today, we are running that special on liver shield with oxy powder 25% off and I'm going to extend it to Wednesday and then it is over.
[01:39:28.549 --> 01:39:31.710]  And I'm going to extend free shipping and 10% off on the Alexa Pure
[01:39:32.984 --> 01:39:42.090]  Pro system water filters and other systems at InfoWarsStore.com through Wednesday at 2 o'clock, and those specials will end.
[01:39:42.591 --> 01:39:46.313]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:39:47.834 --> 01:39:58.202]  Also, you've got a month and a half to get your orders in on the limited edition Hillary for Prison t-shirts.
[01:39:59.079 --> 01:40:00.862]  And she probably will be the major nominee.
[01:40:00.942 --> 01:40:03.466]  Unfortunately, we've been looking for the fall of Hillary.
[01:40:03.486 --> 01:40:09.275]  She's come very close to falling, but she just has too much dirt on people, at least at this time.
[01:40:10.970 --> 01:40:11.910]  She's not fallen yet.
[01:40:12.231 --> 01:40:13.791]  She is teetering up on the edge.
[01:40:14.232 --> 01:40:15.912]  So you get to spread the word about this criminal.
[01:40:15.932 --> 01:40:17.193]  You get to be politically incorrect.
[01:40:17.453 --> 01:40:20.014]  You get to support a hardcore broadcast that promotes liberty and freedom.
[01:40:20.314 --> 01:40:24.796]  The answer to political correctness is to triple down and exercise your free speech even more.
[01:40:25.077 --> 01:40:27.398]  Whether you're in Europe or here in the United States or Australia.
[01:40:28.118 --> 01:40:28.978]  Use it or lose it.
[01:40:28.998 --> 01:40:29.699]  It's like muscles.
[01:40:30.459 --> 01:40:32.140]  So those shirts available in all sizes.
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:33.540]  InfoWarsStore.com
[01:40:36.161 --> 01:40:37.922]  Or 888-253-3139.
[01:40:39.363 --> 01:40:40.483]  Great conversation piece.
[01:40:40.543 --> 01:40:41.703]  You tell folks, here's the truth.
[01:40:42.123 --> 01:40:43.624]  InfoWars.com on the back.
[01:40:44.004 --> 01:40:46.525]  Legalized freedom, to use a Ron Paul quote.
[01:40:47.145 --> 01:40:49.346]  So again, InfoWars.com.
[01:40:49.706 --> 01:40:54.147]  Link through to InfoWarsStore.com and find all of that.
[01:40:54.247 --> 01:40:58.769]  And we also have Brain Force, amazing brain pill, back in stock.
[01:40:59.787 --> 01:41:08.277]  It's got a whole bunch of known compounds, some of them prescription in Europe, that are natural and healthy and totally organic, that absolutely turbocharge my brain.
[01:41:08.297 --> 01:41:09.999]  There's a lot of brain pills out there, folks.
[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:13.444]  I just challenge you, it's very affordable to get a bottle of this and see for yourself.
[01:41:13.844 --> 01:41:15.046]  We've got DNA Force.
[01:41:15.646 --> 01:41:16.588]  We've got Knockout.
[01:41:16.988 --> 01:41:18.970]  Look, it's nine different ingredients.
[01:41:20.433 --> 01:41:21.775]  And it's $19.95.
[01:41:21.855 --> 01:41:25.479]  You can get the same dose of melatonin for $25-$30.
[01:41:25.959 --> 01:41:35.891]  This is the same dose of organic melatonin with L-tryptophan, chamomile flower extract, GABA, valerian root extract, and more.
[01:41:36.889 --> 01:41:40.271]  And it just is very effective when I'm all jazzed up at midnight, can't go to sleep.
[01:41:40.631 --> 01:41:42.472]  I take one of these, 30 minutes later, I really feel it.
[01:41:43.072 --> 01:41:44.933]  If I take two, I'm kind of sluggish in the morning.
[01:41:46.374 --> 01:41:55.359]  But this is something that has a bunch of stuff in it, so it hits you depending on your physiological makeup, your metabolism, different things may hit you differently.
[01:41:55.679 --> 01:41:58.961]  So it's got a bunch of different things in it that are known to work together in synergy.
[01:41:59.341 --> 01:42:02.943]  Safely Knockout is available at infowareslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:42:07.210 --> 01:42:12.911]  But the specials end on Wednesday at 2 o'clock, so you've got about two and a half days to take advantage of that.
[01:42:13.988 --> 01:42:14.148]  You're
[01:42:45.389 --> 01:42:48.952]  Okay, without further ado, I'm going to go to your phone calls for the balance of the hour.
[01:42:49.312 --> 01:42:52.634]  Then the Cashless Society control grid comes into plain view.
[01:42:54.296 --> 01:42:56.938]  Hundreds of cops kicked off force for committing sex crimes.
[01:42:58.939 --> 01:43:06.545]  We have a very important article about homicide rate dropping and folks with concealed carries killing people that try to rob them.
[01:43:07.545 --> 01:43:08.866]  And we've got the tectonic news.
[01:43:10.066 --> 01:43:11.687]  And more coming up at the next hour.
[01:43:11.707 --> 01:43:13.207]  We'll continue with your calls as well.
[01:43:13.227 --> 01:43:18.930]  We're going to go to Brian in a minute and then Carl, Adam, Mark, Jim and others.
[01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:21.891]  But Brian in Kentucky, you're up first.
[01:43:21.931 --> 01:43:22.291]  Go ahead.
[01:43:22.311 --> 01:43:22.911]  Thank you for calling.
[01:43:24.272 --> 01:43:26.073]  Yes, Alex, I appreciate your phone.
[01:43:26.573 --> 01:43:28.814]  Allow me to talk to you this evening, this afternoon.
[01:43:30.514 --> 01:43:36.677]  I just want to talk about the borders and how we really need to concentrate on the state legislatures.
[01:43:37.307 --> 01:43:53.876]  Well, brother, what they do is, what they're doing is so criminal, so larcenous, so out in the open, and I appreciate your call, it's a great point, I'm going to elaborate on that now, that they need us to be buffaloed by it, and just, they go so over the top, we just submit.
[01:44:06.874 --> 01:44:18.580]  The fact that 400 plus cities, 800 plus towns, will not give illegals to the police to deport, to ICE, even if they're felons.
[01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:21.081]  Rape, arson, armed robbery.
[01:44:21.521 --> 01:44:23.122]  I mean, they've got to pretty much commit a murder.
[01:44:26.946 --> 01:44:36.688]  And the argument the police chief of Austin's given me here in studio is, well, if we do arrest illegals for basically crimes, then they won't report crimes to us.
[01:44:36.768 --> 01:44:37.708]  What does that mean?
[01:44:39.408 --> 01:44:40.549]  What does that even mean?
[01:44:43.249 --> 01:44:44.209]  It's very frustrating.
[01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:52.251]  And I've had Travis County prosecutors, deputy prosecutors, have come and visited me and shown me documents that aren't secret, but they're
[01:44:54.070 --> 01:45:01.036]  Well, I've been to the studios, The Point, and shown me the $10 and $20 fines, and basically memos that have gone out to the police.
[01:45:01.596 --> 01:45:07.101]  They go out to captains, and then the captains tell them, okay, just take it easy with the illegals, because the judges are just going to let them go anyways.
[01:45:07.341 --> 01:45:10.164]  And that's come out in the news around the country, but think about that.
[01:45:12.725 --> 01:45:13.905]  They want the illegals here.
[01:45:13.945 --> 01:45:15.566]  They want them to operate under the radar.
[01:45:16.086 --> 01:45:19.226]  They want them to launder money for the Democratic Party and get all these tax returns.
[01:45:19.746 --> 01:45:22.267]  One address in Austin laundered $89 million.
[01:45:22.927 --> 01:45:24.267]  Five illegals lived in the house.
[01:45:24.887 --> 01:45:25.867]  No one was prosecuted.
[01:45:26.368 --> 01:45:29.108]  One address laundered over $100 million in Atlanta.
[01:45:29.148 --> 01:45:29.868]  It was the top city.
[01:45:31.008 --> 01:45:31.729]  Remember a few years ago?
[01:45:31.749 --> 01:45:33.109]  AP investigation?
[01:45:33.929 --> 01:45:34.809]  Even AP reported on it.
[01:45:35.149 --> 01:45:38.530]  Where the illegals... Well, who do you think is laundering all that money?
[01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:39.410]  The Democratic Party.
[01:45:42.230 --> 01:45:44.371]  They use the illegals as a cut-out, folks.
[01:45:44.871 --> 01:45:47.732]  And the Republicans are involved in some corruption, but I gotta be honest.
[01:45:48.132 --> 01:45:50.093]  They mainly make money off big war-mongering.
[01:45:51.374 --> 01:45:54.415]  Republicans are involved in the narcotics trafficking itself, some of them.
[01:45:55.015 --> 01:45:59.637]  I mean, they're involved in some bad stuff, but man, the Democrats are just down to the grassroots level.
[01:45:59.917 --> 01:46:03.539]  They've been running criminal operations since New York City, since Boston.
[01:46:04.872 --> 01:46:06.193]  Look at, look at Acorn.
[01:46:06.933 --> 01:46:10.415]  Where you walk and you go, I got child prostitutes, I want to run them as slaves.
[01:46:10.896 --> 01:46:11.416]  How do I do that?
[01:46:11.456 --> 01:46:15.018]  Well, you just put them in school, because all we want is our cut of the money, and you pay your taxes.
[01:46:15.459 --> 01:46:20.482]  It doesn't matter if it's illegal, just you run your prostitution operation with those kids and you'll be fine.
[01:46:20.502 --> 01:46:22.563]  Remember the Acorn videos?
[01:46:25.065 --> 01:46:28.107]  I mean, you get around these Democrats, man, these are gangsters, folks.
[01:46:28.747 --> 01:46:30.828]  They are low down, they are mean.
[01:46:31.289 --> 01:46:33.190]  They'll laugh at you and go, of course we're race baiting.
[01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:35.151]  How do you think you control people?
[01:46:36.391 --> 01:46:41.975]  I sat there and had black people look right at me and go, listen, Alex, you know you don't want all these black people around.
[01:46:42.035 --> 01:46:44.436]  These ugly looking nappy head black people.
[01:46:44.736 --> 01:46:45.737]  We're going to kill them.
[01:46:46.057 --> 01:46:46.797]  I'm like, you're black.
[01:46:46.837 --> 01:46:47.538]  What's your problem?
[01:46:47.818 --> 01:46:48.719]  I care about all children.
[01:46:49.139 --> 01:46:50.740]  You just make me sick.
[01:46:52.021 --> 01:46:54.082]  They go out and get their brand new Mercedes Benz.
[01:46:54.942 --> 01:46:57.304]  I've had black leaders in Austin.
[01:46:58.286 --> 01:47:00.427]  I used to go down to the Access TV station where they had shows.
[01:47:01.047 --> 01:47:02.468]  Just sit there right in the hallway.
[01:47:02.828 --> 01:47:04.888]  And they'd have them file complaints on me and stuff.
[01:47:04.968 --> 01:47:07.489]  I mean, just, just like, man!
[01:47:07.770 --> 01:47:12.011]  But I guess if you feed on your own people all day, that's your attitude towards them.
[01:47:12.831 --> 01:47:14.872]  These are sick, sick, sick, sick people.
[01:47:15.873 --> 01:47:16.853]  Very, very sick people.
[01:47:17.333 --> 01:47:18.854]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:47:22.735 --> 01:47:23.615]  It's just crazy.
[01:47:25.596 --> 01:47:26.656]  I've told the story many times.
[01:47:26.736 --> 01:47:27.797]  Our IT guy one night,
[01:47:29.093 --> 01:47:33.056]  I was pulling into the office, it was like a Friday night or something, about seven o'clock.
[01:47:33.436 --> 01:47:34.377]  I was pulling to do some work.
[01:47:37.179 --> 01:47:40.141]  And for some reason, before I got there, an alarm had gone off.
[01:47:40.181 --> 01:47:42.302]  That happens sometimes, somebody doesn't close the door right or whatever.
[01:47:44.104 --> 01:47:50.168]  And so I pull up, and one of our IT guys is already there, he's a contractor.
[01:47:51.329 --> 01:47:53.110]  And he'd pulled up right before the alarm went off.
[01:47:54.251 --> 01:47:56.913]  And the cops were asking him who he is, and he says who he is and everything.
[01:47:58.479 --> 01:47:59.860]  And his license was expired.
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:03.022]  And I get there and there's three cops.
[01:48:03.503 --> 01:48:05.524]  One woman looks all freaked out and is backing away from me.
[01:48:05.544 --> 01:48:07.505]  Another cop goes, hi Alex, how you doing, white guy?
[01:48:07.525 --> 01:48:11.108]  And they're putting him in the cop car.
[01:48:13.592 --> 01:48:15.493]  And then the black cop goes, man, I'm a big fan.
[01:48:15.513 --> 01:48:16.914]  You ought to hear my rock and roll band.
[01:48:17.355 --> 01:48:18.115]  I just played in New York.
[01:48:18.135 --> 01:48:18.675]  It's really cool.
[01:48:18.715 --> 01:48:18.976]  Blah, blah.
[01:48:18.996 --> 01:48:20.257]  And I'm like, okay, we're friends.
[01:48:20.337 --> 01:48:20.677]  Fine.
[01:48:20.717 --> 01:48:21.297]  You're a nice guy.
[01:48:22.118 --> 01:48:23.599]  And he goes, yeah, I haven't listened to you for years.
[01:48:23.659 --> 01:48:23.959]  Blah, blah.
[01:48:23.979 --> 01:48:25.520]  And they're putting him in the squad car.
[01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:28.962]  And I go, so you're putting him in the squad car, but if it's illegal, you let him go.
[01:48:28.982 --> 01:48:29.983]  And he goes, that's right.
[01:48:30.023 --> 01:48:30.864]  That's what we're told to do.
[01:48:30.884 --> 01:48:36.928]  So I go over to the other car, and he's already in the back of it.
[01:48:36.968 --> 01:48:39.309]  She walks over and I go, she was a Hispanic lady.
[01:48:39.329 --> 01:48:42.732]  And I go, you know you wouldn't arrest him if he was an illegal alien from Mexico.
[01:48:44.554 --> 01:48:50.416]  She just looks at me and then gets in the car, and the two guys go, yeah, you're right, but this is what we do, bye Alex!
[01:48:51.836 --> 01:48:53.196]  And they drive away with him to jail.
[01:48:54.717 --> 01:48:58.738]  I mean, that's experiencing this in America.
[01:49:00.479 --> 01:49:02.359]  Because he was a six foot four white guy, I guess.
[01:49:03.539 --> 01:49:08.701]  And I guess under political correctness, he's white, I guess he deserves to go to jail to teach him something?
[01:49:11.445 --> 01:49:12.486]  Let's go to a phone call.
[01:49:12.566 --> 01:49:14.166]  Jim in Georgia, thanks for calling.
[01:49:14.186 --> 01:49:14.767]  You're on the air.
[01:49:16.187 --> 01:49:18.148]  Oh, it's an honor to speak with you again, brother.
[01:49:18.449 --> 01:49:19.109]  Welcome, go ahead.
[01:49:20.129 --> 01:49:21.430]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:28.854]  I know this is an artificially constructed clash of civilizations, but obviously there are real consequences.
[01:49:28.914 --> 01:49:34.557]  I just wanted to say that we will not allow our women to be treated the way of Sharia law.
[01:49:34.897 --> 01:49:36.818]  That's because you're anti-feminist and anti-woman.
[01:49:38.056 --> 01:49:38.856]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:49:39.236 --> 01:49:41.097]  Sharia law will not fly here.
[01:49:41.357 --> 01:49:42.277]  We got our guns.
[01:49:42.417 --> 01:49:48.139]  You don't want to have your women cuckold and you don't want to have the radical Muslims order you around with a bunch of liberal socialists hopping around?
[01:49:48.159 --> 01:49:50.120]  No way, Jack.
[01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:52.160]  Ain't gonna happen here.
[01:49:53.921 --> 01:49:57.622]  That's why, exactly, and I know that's why they're gearing up Homeland Security to come after the American people.
[01:49:57.862 --> 01:49:59.422]  But I don't see them getting away with this.
[01:49:59.722 --> 01:50:05.664]  They hate America so bad and Europe so bad, they literally want to drive a stake into our heart like we're a vampire.
[01:50:07.193 --> 01:50:08.134]  You're like, we're the vampire.
[01:50:08.154 --> 01:50:10.495]  So you feel it.
[01:50:25.908 --> 01:50:26.728]  Will not happen.
[01:50:27.509 --> 01:50:32.431]  And I, again, I mean, from my cold, dead hands, and you can take them lead first, Jack, that's all I'm gonna say.
[01:50:32.711 --> 01:50:42.656]  Well, what do you think about all the spoiled, rotten Western women that have lived in the lap of luxury, where all the great Renaissance freedoms came from, who have been taught to hate the freedom in the West?
[01:50:43.697 --> 01:50:45.738]  What are they gonna think under radical Islam?
[01:50:46.939 --> 01:50:53.642]  Well, they're gonna realize then that they have been suffered, and that the real men, they have allowed them to be neutered.
[01:50:54.733 --> 01:50:55.074]  I don't know.
[01:51:09.633 --> 01:51:12.574]  My name is Bill Bonner and I have an important message.
[01:51:12.875 --> 01:51:18.037]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[01:51:18.357 --> 01:51:20.258]  But they're about to lose control.
[01:51:20.638 --> 01:51:25.621]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[01:51:25.961 --> 01:51:30.403]  From where we shop to the doctors you visit and the family you want to protect.
[01:51:30.543 --> 01:51:32.544]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[01:51:32.564 --> 01:51:36.445]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[01:51:36.785 --> 01:51:40.846]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[01:51:41.307 --> 01:51:44.208]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[01:51:44.408 --> 01:51:46.828]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[01:51:47.008 --> 01:51:48.289]  This will affect us all.
[01:51:48.849 --> 01:51:53.313]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.

[01:53:11.163 --> 01:53:12.845]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?

[01:54:12.186 --> 01:54:23.633]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, they're trying to completely break our will.
[01:54:23.894 --> 01:54:38.944]  It's a psychological program of learned helplessness and a situational syndrome where you develop a normalcy bias to just anything.
[01:54:40.117 --> 01:54:46.980]  And so stuff's getting really radical, it's getting really crazy, it's getting over the top, because they're about to pull stuff that's even wilder.
[01:54:49.261 --> 01:54:50.881]  And they just want to normalize.
[01:54:51.401 --> 01:54:59.825]  Helicopters ascending on your town, blowing stuff up, checkpoints on the highways, armored vehicles, open borders, retina scanning to buy and sell.
[01:55:00.885 --> 01:55:02.506]  With the young, trendies,
[01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:18.162]  Sitting there watching television, playing video games on their iPads all day, losing language, losing interpersonal skills, and only receiving education and political correctness to just moan and groan and just be totally freaked out and depressed.
[01:55:18.863 --> 01:55:20.825]  Because they've never had any real life experiences.
[01:55:20.845 --> 01:55:23.487]  They've been coddled their whole lives.
[01:55:23.627 --> 01:55:26.210]  All they've got is insecurity and neurosis.
[01:55:27.366 --> 01:55:31.547]  The whites are self-hating, weird chicken necks.
[01:55:31.667 --> 01:55:42.670]  The minorities, not even on average, but they've got their core group, are angry, chip on the shoulder, something's been done to me, and any white person around might be one of these people.
[01:55:43.590 --> 01:55:45.811]  That guy's wearing a captain's hat, he may be a Nazi.
[01:55:48.412 --> 01:55:49.352]  Everything offends me.
[01:55:50.272 --> 01:55:50.892]  I'm good at it.
[01:55:51.512 --> 01:55:53.733]  And boy, when they would do this to other people, they would start groveling.
[01:55:56.704 --> 01:55:58.506]  So you hear all these hundreds of magazines.
[01:55:58.526 --> 01:55:59.747]  When I say hundreds, it's gotta be thousands.
[01:55:59.787 --> 01:56:05.634]  I've seen hundreds of magazine articles this year and last year saying, don't wear the wrong outfit, universities saying do it.
[01:56:05.874 --> 01:56:06.635]  This is sick!
[01:56:08.357 --> 01:56:09.999]  And then radical Islam shows up.
[01:56:12.645 --> 01:56:15.789]  By the way, there weren't really Hispanic groups that were offended by American flags.
[01:56:15.829 --> 01:56:17.591]  That was the media just kind of hyping that up.
[01:56:17.631 --> 01:56:19.673]  And now all over the country, can't have American flags.
[01:56:20.454 --> 01:56:21.936]  It hurts Mexicans' feelings.
[01:56:22.537 --> 01:56:24.078]  Or can't have American flags in New York.
[01:56:24.118 --> 01:56:25.260]  It hurts Muslims' feelings.
[01:56:25.420 --> 01:56:26.661]  Or you can't...
[01:56:31.087 --> 01:56:33.348]  You know, wear a shirt that says, I defend the Second Amendment.
[01:56:33.708 --> 01:56:35.549]  It's about destroying language.
[01:56:35.609 --> 01:56:36.950]  And I know you know that.
[01:56:37.591 --> 01:56:40.432]  But they're making their move because big stuff's about to start happening.
[01:56:40.692 --> 01:56:41.633]  And they hate Muslims.
[01:56:42.213 --> 01:56:47.216]  The globalists are destabilizing their countries, wrecking them, putting radicals in charge that oppress people.
[01:56:47.716 --> 01:56:53.920]  There were lots of Muslim countries that were becoming first world, wanted to work with the West, wanted to be Western.
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:55.881]  And our government from Iran
[01:56:56.963 --> 01:57:02.068]  To you name it, in the last 50, 60 years, overthrew those places and put radicals in charge.
[01:57:03.529 --> 01:57:04.590]  And that's the big secret.
[01:57:05.591 --> 01:57:11.416]  Is the people running the show want to hamstring the Middle East with a bunch of crazies.
[01:57:12.557 --> 01:57:14.599]  And so we have committed crimes against the Middle East.
[01:57:14.739 --> 01:57:15.320]  Our elites have.
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:17.081]  Our elites committed crimes against Russia.
[01:57:18.142 --> 01:57:18.423]  Putting
[01:57:19.639 --> 01:57:20.740]  The Bolsheviks in charge.
[01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:22.201]  And I'm not demonizing the West.
[01:57:22.442 --> 01:57:41.299]  We were the greatest, the most inventive, the most wealthy, the most sophisticated, and the most hardcore criminal syndicates developed criminal operations so sophisticated, so diabolical, that the people of the West couldn't decipher it.
[01:57:42.170 --> 01:57:46.751]  And now we're living multiple generations into brainwashing, into mind control.
[01:57:47.111 --> 01:57:50.652]  I don't want to skip any callers or go to them too quick, so I'm going to give everybody some time.
[01:57:51.092 --> 01:57:54.073]  Adam in Florida, Mark, Stephen, Cal, Rich, and others.
[01:57:54.093 --> 01:57:55.554]  We're going to go to break here in a minute.
[01:57:55.594 --> 01:57:59.255]  Come back and go directly to your phone calls for the next 20-30 minutes of the hour.
[01:57:59.395 --> 01:58:00.135]  Then I'm going to
[01:58:01.974 --> 01:58:10.718]  Cover the waterfront on news that I've mentioned but haven't gotten to, science news, world news, tectonic earth change news, second amendment news, and so much more.
[01:58:11.199 --> 01:58:25.826]  But when I talk about the over-the-top nature of it, when cities take federal money to then not arrest illegals for serious crimes and then refuse to give them to ICE, and then ICE is told don't deport them.
[01:58:26.820 --> 01:58:40.035]  When a Democratic black sheriff can't even deport five illegals a week, out of hundreds he arrests, who are felons, and they act like it's horrible and mean that he does it, and everyone goes along with it, it shows how they've bullied us into accepting anything.
[01:58:40.615 --> 01:58:42.618]  They have to make the crimes they're committing.
[01:58:43.931 --> 01:58:45.513]  Look like wonderful and good.
[01:58:45.573 --> 01:58:47.917]  I mean, it's criminal the sheriff doesn't deport all the illegals.
[01:58:48.277 --> 01:58:48.678]  But see?
[01:58:49.199 --> 01:58:50.981]  All the illegals that are committing crimes, that is.
[01:58:51.262 --> 01:58:51.923]  But, but no!
[01:58:52.383 --> 01:58:52.784]  No, no, no.
[01:58:52.884 --> 01:58:54.727]  It's bad that he deports anybody, see?
[01:58:55.247 --> 01:58:57.551]  Just, it's outrageous Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:58:57.891 --> 01:58:58.372]  We'll be back.
[01:58:59.793 --> 01:59:01.154]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:59:01.434 --> 01:59:02.735]  You can't survive without it.
[01:59:02.935 --> 01:59:03.836]  But where do you get it?

[02:00:15.973 --> 02:00:20.115]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:20.796 --> 02:00:21.596]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.377 --> 02:00:23.277]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.918 --> 02:00:27.540]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:32.203]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.303 --> 02:00:33.964]  Alright, I'm going to make it for the next 30 minutes.
[02:00:33.984 --> 02:00:35.004]  I'm doing nothing but taking calls.
[02:00:35.024 --> 02:00:36.765]  I've got to stop covering news and get to your calls.
[02:00:37.506 --> 02:00:39.407]  Adam in Florida, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:00:40.788 --> 02:00:41.308]  Howdy, Alex.
[02:00:41.608 --> 02:00:42.189]  Welcome, sir.
[02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:42.769]  Thank you for calling.
[02:00:43.618 --> 02:00:43.878]  Yeah.
[02:00:44.558 --> 02:00:49.280]  Colin basically just by little synopsis, by little prediction about these elections coming up here.
[02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:59.563]  And I'm not a gambling man, but you know, looking at the odds, it's like Hillary's going to get it and there's really not going to be much opposition to her.
[02:01:00.183 --> 02:01:04.604]  And, um, it's like, um, we got to hit rock bottom before things get better.
[02:01:04.624 --> 02:01:06.045]  And I think she's worse than Obama.
[02:01:07.005 --> 02:01:09.786]  So, um, it's scary, but I just don't see.
[02:01:11.118 --> 02:01:15.421]  A conceivable outcome of one of these Republican candidates getting it.
[02:01:15.441 --> 02:01:16.341]  Well, think about this.
[02:01:17.402 --> 02:01:18.242]  She's a globalist.
[02:01:18.562 --> 02:01:20.303]  She wants to graduate to the globalist level.
[02:01:20.564 --> 02:01:22.265]  She wants to be part of the world government program.
[02:01:23.185 --> 02:01:25.086]  That's why I call them globalists, because that's what they are.
[02:01:25.106 --> 02:01:28.648]  They're transferring power to an unelected central world government.
[02:01:30.029 --> 02:01:36.113]  And so, when we look at that, you're absolutely right that she couldn't be even worse than Obama.
[02:01:37.324 --> 02:01:45.548]  And imagine, she doesn't just want to transfer power, what she sucks off of, what she enslaves, she also has disdain for and hates.
[02:01:46.148 --> 02:01:50.330]  So she absolutely hates the people that have made this country successful.
[02:01:50.610 --> 02:01:53.191]  She hates the free market, she's a criminal slug.
[02:01:54.271 --> 02:02:00.594]  Well if your theories are true about how they want to rewrite, you know, remake America and bring us down, which it seems like it's
[02:02:01.471 --> 02:02:01.911]  Accurate.
[02:02:01.971 --> 02:02:04.532]  Well, first you got the race issue with Obama.
[02:02:04.572 --> 02:02:06.093]  Now we can divide us on the sexes.
[02:02:06.613 --> 02:02:08.173]  And just, it's obvious.
[02:02:08.233 --> 02:02:08.733]  Exactly.
[02:02:08.753 --> 02:02:11.294]  If you don't support Hillary, it's because you hate women.
[02:02:11.314 --> 02:02:13.755]  And then all these women will strut around.
[02:02:13.795 --> 02:02:16.136]  They admit it's like a cult of all the reporters.
[02:02:16.296 --> 02:02:18.316]  All of them that follow her are all women.
[02:02:18.657 --> 02:02:21.157]  And they're just into the cult of they're going to win.
[02:02:21.197 --> 02:02:22.658]  And this is a step for women.
[02:02:23.158 --> 02:02:24.839]  This is a step back for women.
[02:02:24.879 --> 02:02:29.220]  That if the first American president is this arch criminal, it's truly shameful.
[02:02:30.784 --> 02:02:35.140]  I was talking to a Democrat yesterday and he was like, I can't stand Hillary or Clinton.
[02:02:37.773 --> 02:02:38.413]  Well, I know this.
[02:02:38.834 --> 02:02:43.297]  I don't completely trust Donald Trump, but he is not a psychotic demon like Hillary Clinton.
[02:02:43.317 --> 02:02:49.141]  I mean, you can see she is manifestly evil, and her actions are evil, and just God help us.
[02:02:49.221 --> 02:02:51.903]  The good news is she looks very ill.
[02:02:52.443 --> 02:02:57.126]  She looks like she's probably on speed, and I think God's going to deal with Hillary Clinton.
[02:02:57.146 --> 02:03:00.648]  In fact, I don't normally pray for bad things to happen to people.
[02:03:00.768 --> 02:03:04.251]  I just pray that God deliver us from Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
[02:03:05.615 --> 02:03:08.757]  And I repent for all the bad stuff this country's done, but man, I got children.
[02:03:09.157 --> 02:03:15.280]  And I hit my knees every night and just begged God to intercede and protect the children from this ghoul.
[02:03:16.441 --> 02:03:31.749]  And all these sycophantic, pathetic people that, you know, hold their daughters in their arms like she's going to empower American women when everything they're about is destroying femininity and the magical power of women and basically using them as like a mule
[02:03:32.529 --> 02:03:34.511]  Pull a plow for them through society.
[02:03:34.771 --> 02:03:38.514]  They want to shackle women and shackle that great spirit.
[02:03:38.815 --> 02:03:40.556]  They hate women's power to give birth.
[02:03:40.916 --> 02:03:41.957]  They hate the family.
[02:03:42.257 --> 02:03:45.340]  And by attacking women, they've destroyed the heart of humanity.
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:46.461]  It's truly disgusting.
[02:03:48.143 --> 02:03:49.604]  Ten years ago, I would have said you're crazy.
[02:03:51.519 --> 02:03:56.781]  Well, their admitted plan is to make women unfertile and to confuse them and make sure they're all alone and destroy any family unit.
[02:03:57.242 --> 02:04:00.203]  But also to turn men into lazy, stupid, childlike idiots.
[02:04:00.803 --> 02:04:01.904]  So that women can't find men.
[02:04:02.684 --> 02:04:06.186]  But women, listen, women have an incredible history on this planet.
[02:04:07.066 --> 02:04:13.948]  At the heart of our species and their genetics, their intuition, everything is kicking in against the new world order right now.
[02:04:14.669 --> 02:04:18.330]  And how dare the system try to get between the magic of a man and woman.
[02:04:18.650 --> 02:04:26.213]  They've tried to make the economy and the culture not reward the family and not reward that incredible union of the man and the woman.
[02:04:26.773 --> 02:04:29.974]  And that's under attack because that is God's greatest gift.
[02:04:30.274 --> 02:04:31.354]  That's God in action.
[02:04:31.394 --> 02:04:33.095]  That's magic in action right there.
[02:04:33.655 --> 02:04:36.886]  So they've done everything they can to screw that up, but it's not going to work.
[02:04:38.692 --> 02:04:39.093]  Right on.
[02:04:39.133 --> 02:04:40.237]  God bless you and I love you guys.
[02:04:40.885 --> 02:04:41.586]  We love you too.
[02:04:41.666 --> 02:04:43.247]  And I get it if you're talking about the power of women.
[02:04:43.287 --> 02:04:47.951]  I mean, this is not me trying to sit there and butter women up about how much I love women.
[02:04:48.011 --> 02:04:50.033]  I mean, I go beyond Trump.
[02:04:50.193 --> 02:04:51.014]  I do cherish women.
[02:04:51.834 --> 02:04:53.896]  And I like the company of women.
[02:04:54.557 --> 02:05:00.902]  I like how women look, how they smell, how they laugh, what they do, all their little games, all the little silly things they do, all the wonderful things they do.
[02:05:01.863 --> 02:05:03.244]  I like women.
[02:05:03.704 --> 02:05:04.545]  And that's what it comes down to.
[02:05:04.565 --> 02:05:05.746]  I want to see women empowered.
[02:05:05.766 --> 02:05:07.488]  And I want to see women strong.
[02:05:08.008 --> 02:05:08.949]  And the globalists want to kill you.
[02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:15.954]  Featured now at Infowars.com, for the first time ever, majority of Democrats now view socialism favorably.
[02:05:16.214 --> 02:05:26.760]  Doug Ross writes, the man currently running a distant second for the Democratic presidential nomination, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, is a self-declared socialist, and most of his party's voters now have a positive view of socialism.
[02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:35.605]  Socialism and the other offshoots of Marxism have failed in literally every venue it has been tried, despite progressive laughable efforts to claim certain countries have implemented it successfully.
[02:05:35.805 --> 02:05:38.589]  And let's look at the so-called success of European countries.
[02:05:38.910 --> 02:05:44.539]  Every one of them has rung up immense levels of unsustainable debt, thanks to the endless wealth redistribution schemes.
[02:05:44.919 --> 02:05:49.607]  Oh, and let's not forget, in the 20th century alone, communism led the way with the murders of 110 men, women, and children.
[02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:55.111]  But that's not stopping Bill Gates from saying only socialism can save the planet.
[02:05:55.251 --> 02:06:00.375]  He added, without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or plant buyers to switch.
[02:06:00.715 --> 02:06:05.818]  Carbon taxes have been created to do only one thing, kill off the emerging country's populations.
[02:06:06.138 --> 02:06:09.140]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:06:09.620 --> 02:06:19.523]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high-quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at HDFirearms.com.

[02:07:08.649 --> 02:07:12.771]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[02:07:13.051 --> 02:07:18.355]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[02:07:18.655 --> 02:07:20.736]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form.
[02:07:21.116 --> 02:07:26.537]  Of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[02:07:26.997 --> 02:07:32.678]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[02:07:33.139 --> 02:07:38.120]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[02:07:38.180 --> 02:07:42.100]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:44.621]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire.
[02:07:44.881 --> 02:07:45.341]  We're good.
[02:08:15.874 --> 02:08:17.457]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:08:17.798 --> 02:08:24.011]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:42.119 --> 02:08:50.084]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to play a clip from a film I made in 2008 called Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:08:50.104 --> 02:08:52.005]  It's free online on YouTube.
[02:08:53.705 --> 02:08:56.487]  And in Endgame, they tried to take it down about seven or eight times.
[02:08:56.507 --> 02:08:59.288]  I had to basically file a lawsuit to keep it up one time.
[02:08:59.869 --> 02:09:01.550]  They were claiming the music was somebody else's.
[02:09:01.850 --> 02:09:05.712]  I paid to have that music composed by Graham Reynolds in Austin, Texas.
[02:09:07.841 --> 02:09:18.004]  They also claim music that Rob Jacobson made here, in front of me on a synthesizer, the intro music, like the Ditri-Doo noise, wow, wow, wow.
[02:09:20.765 --> 02:09:21.625]  But that's a side issue.
[02:09:21.645 --> 02:09:26.646]  The point is, don't take this free film that cost me a half million dollars to make or whatever, for granted.
[02:09:26.726 --> 02:09:28.447]  Please, get it out to people.
[02:09:28.967 --> 02:09:37.109]  And it's got a clip of Al Gore in congressional hearings in 2007, saying, there is no plan for carbon taxes, it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:09:38.029 --> 02:09:44.998]  And of course he had already set up the carbon exchange in London called Gore and Blood with his partner.
[02:09:46.721 --> 02:09:48.603]  And he's saying it doesn't exist.
[02:09:48.984 --> 02:09:50.966]  Well, Bill Gates is in the news today.
[02:09:51.687 --> 02:09:54.271]  Bill Gates, only socialism can save the planet.
[02:09:56.015 --> 02:10:00.579]  Without a substantial carbon tax, there's no initiative for innovators or plant buyers to switch.
[02:10:00.599 --> 02:10:02.601]  In fact, they found the clip already.
[02:10:02.641 --> 02:10:03.622]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[02:10:03.642 --> 02:10:05.463]  I'll get back into this at the bottom of the hour.
[02:10:05.483 --> 02:10:09.547]  But I want to explain why this is so diabolical when we get to the bottom of the hour after calls.
[02:10:09.607 --> 02:10:12.649]  I'm about to go to Carl and others here in a moment.
[02:10:13.250 --> 02:10:14.771]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[02:10:17.954 --> 02:10:19.135]  Put a price on the carbon.
[02:10:19.795 --> 02:10:20.936]  A tax is the best way.
[02:10:21.197 --> 02:10:22.518]  Cap and trade can also do it.
[02:10:23.542 --> 02:10:33.966]  If there were a carbon-based tax, would there be a need for an economy-wide cap-and-trade system?
[02:10:34.967 --> 02:10:36.287]  They are not either-or.
[02:10:37.388 --> 02:10:38.268]  We can do both.
[02:10:38.468 --> 02:10:39.609]  I am in favor of both.
[02:10:43.067 --> 02:10:43.867]  Let's stop right there.
[02:10:44.647 --> 02:10:47.268]  And there's another clip where Gore denies it, then he says it.
[02:10:47.288 --> 02:10:48.609]  So you guys found that quick.
[02:10:49.169 --> 02:10:50.209]  We're kind of on the fly here.
[02:10:50.889 --> 02:10:53.110]  That's not the exact clip, but do this.
[02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:54.670]  Back it up even more.
[02:10:55.430 --> 02:11:02.892]  Where Rothschild, the heir to the Rothschild fortune, was on my show, pushing a children's book about polar bears not being able to swim, literally.
[02:11:03.573 --> 02:11:07.354]  His job is adventurer and hero.
[02:11:07.554 --> 02:11:08.494]  That's what they say about him.
[02:11:10.552 --> 02:11:22.235]  And Rothschild is on the show saying that the Earth is closer to the Sun than Mars, that's why... Or Mars is closer to the Sun than Earth, which of course is the opposite order.
[02:11:22.575 --> 02:11:24.275]  Mars is the fourth planet out.
[02:11:24.975 --> 02:11:28.116]  And then he goes on to say there is no plan for a carbon tax, it doesn't exist.
[02:11:28.516 --> 02:11:32.257]  And then we cut to Al Gore admitting it exists, but then we also have Al Gore saying it doesn't exist.
[02:11:32.297 --> 02:11:33.457]  But here is that clip.
[02:11:35.997 --> 02:11:37.978]  Just like, back it up 30 seconds like I was saying.
[02:11:38.971 --> 02:11:39.351]  I don't think so.
[02:11:56.681 --> 02:12:00.082]  Really thinking that socialism is what's going to give them this pie in the sky.
[02:12:00.382 --> 02:12:02.422]  I mean, who would want to just be given stuff?
[02:12:03.022 --> 02:12:04.583]  Or told what job you're going to have?
[02:12:04.903 --> 02:12:06.963]  Plus, socialism always creates a nightmare.
[02:12:07.303 --> 02:12:11.284]  Europe was so wealthy, now after 40 years of socialism, it's going bankrupt.
[02:12:11.624 --> 02:12:12.824]  They got a bunch of lazy people.
[02:12:14.685 --> 02:12:22.566]  And the socialists are bringing in a bunch more people to be lazy, to outvote any indigenous populations that don't want to go along with it.
[02:12:23.007 --> 02:12:25.027]  Here is the Rothschild clip with the Al Gore clip.
[02:12:25.998 --> 02:12:27.744]  What did he do with carbon taxes?
[02:12:28.326 --> 02:12:31.175]  I guess he hadn't spoken with his good personal friend, Al Gore.
[02:12:33.718 --> 02:12:36.420]  Global warming, the time for debate is over.
[02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:42.565]  I think what you have to realize is that being environmentally sensitive and making money aren't mutually exclusive.
[02:12:42.605 --> 02:12:46.228]  There's a lot of money to be made in addressing this issue.
[02:12:46.488 --> 02:12:53.834]  But you guys are gobbling up all the world's concern to just simply line your pockets and make kids read your book in schools and do all this.
[02:12:53.894 --> 02:12:56.056]  It's a business, just like you said Rothschild.
[02:12:56.796 --> 02:12:57.557]  It's not a business.
[02:12:57.577 --> 02:12:58.958]  Do you think I make any money out of this?
[02:12:59.895 --> 02:13:05.699]  It's the same thing, it's the same thing your great-great-great-grand, your money-changing ancestors did.
[02:13:05.919 --> 02:13:09.242]  They're in Germany, Red Shield, and I'm calling you out, Red Shield.
[02:13:09.382 --> 02:13:10.502]  We know it's a scam!
[02:13:11.183 --> 02:13:13.665]  A pollution-based tax system, principally CO2.
[02:13:14.165 --> 02:13:17.287]  We're causing it mainly, vast majority of it.
[02:13:17.767 --> 02:13:21.330]  The consequences are bad and will be catastrophic unless we act.
[02:13:22.806 --> 02:13:33.252]  The polar ice caps of Mars are receding at several miles a year, much faster than ours, and that the moons of Saturn and Jupiter are melting.
[02:13:33.352 --> 02:13:36.433]  In fact, several of their moons were ice and are now liquid seas.
[02:13:38.110 --> 02:13:42.071]  Now, how are SUVs causing that, David Rothschild?
[02:13:42.571 --> 02:13:44.752]  That's because those planets are closer to the sun, my friend.
[02:13:46.112 --> 02:13:50.214]  No, Jupiter and Saturn are not closer to the sun, neither is Mars.
[02:13:50.734 --> 02:13:59.376]  Yes, but I think you'll find, right, that the very simple matter, and what I wanted to say, and this is my final point, forget your taxation theory, because actually it's not taxation.
[02:14:00.477 --> 02:14:01.697]  Put a price on the carbon.
[02:14:02.317 --> 02:14:05.078]  A tax is the best way, cap and trade can also do it.
[02:14:06.084 --> 02:14:16.507]  If there were a carbon-based tax, would there be a need for an economy-wide cap-and-trade system?
[02:14:17.507 --> 02:14:18.848]  They are not either-or.
[02:14:19.928 --> 02:14:20.808]  We can do both.
[02:14:21.008 --> 02:14:22.188]  I am in favor of both.
[02:14:22.349 --> 02:14:22.569]  All right.
[02:14:23.429 --> 02:14:25.970]  Now, why do you think the politicians want this?
[02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:34.592]  Because they're globalists, they get to be part of the carbon boards in Chicago, New York, London, Hamburg, Germany, places like that, Tokyo, Japan.
[02:14:37.034 --> 02:14:43.256]  And then you pay when you use any carbon and it goes into an exchange where people have got to buy credits from this group.
[02:14:44.997 --> 02:14:45.797]  They'll make trillions.
[02:14:46.677 --> 02:14:47.257]  It's incredible.
[02:14:48.518 --> 02:14:51.239]  No wonder they've spent billions and billions trying to push this propaganda.
[02:14:51.439 --> 02:14:52.439]  That's why they won't give up.
[02:14:54.431 --> 02:14:58.512]  Now, I've also got Klipsa Gore saying that there is no carbon tax on CNN.
[02:14:58.532 --> 02:15:00.893]  Well, yeah, because they hadn't passed it yet.
[02:15:01.013 --> 02:15:22.740]  Now they're trying, and that's what's coming up in December in Paris, is this whole new world treaty to set the UN up to have laws against climate deniers and climate criminals, where you get indicted, like Slobodan Milosevic or something of Syria, of Serbia, another regime change,
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:27.201]  Because you fight back against the radical Islamists or whatever.
[02:15:28.781 --> 02:15:29.701]  I mean, that's how they work.
[02:15:29.721 --> 02:15:33.802]  They just have these kangaroo courts that just indict you made up of their people and they just come arrest you.
[02:15:34.082 --> 02:15:34.882]  Global government!
[02:15:36.023 --> 02:15:36.803]  Incredible!
[02:15:37.323 --> 02:15:40.684]  They're firing people from their jobs in Europe that speak out against it.
[02:15:40.724 --> 02:15:48.205]  It's a tyranny where they run the whole economy, they surveil the whole economy, they tax the whole economy selectively to shut down their competition.
[02:15:48.546 --> 02:15:49.346]  It's a joke!
[02:15:49.426 --> 02:15:50.126]  It's crazy!
[02:15:52.253 --> 02:15:54.355]  Carl in Florida, thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[02:15:55.495 --> 02:15:55.776]  Hello?
[02:15:56.016 --> 02:15:56.456]  Yes, sir.
[02:15:57.477 --> 02:15:59.678]  Yes, I have a question about the Second Amendment.
[02:16:00.139 --> 02:16:03.281]  How can we protect it, and why do you think the U.S.
[02:16:03.321 --> 02:16:05.943]  government wants to take away our gun rights?
[02:16:06.736 --> 02:16:08.096]  Well, because the U.S.
[02:16:08.136 --> 02:16:15.378]  government has been hijacked and is occupied by five offshore banks that are sworn to take our guns.
[02:16:15.618 --> 02:16:17.159]  If you look at Goldman Sachs and J.P.
[02:16:17.199 --> 02:16:26.041]  Morgan, they give almost more money than all groups combined for open borders, to take our guns, to get rid of sheriff's departments, and to federalize and globalize things.
[02:16:26.821 --> 02:16:31.903]  They hold the big meetings that honcho the other Fortune 100 to do as they order.
[02:16:32.603 --> 02:16:32.763]  Man...
[02:17:01.971 --> 02:17:02.872]  They are our conquerors.
[02:17:02.912 --> 02:17:03.913]  We are being conquered.
[02:17:05.114 --> 02:17:08.136]  What King George III couldn't do, these guys are doing.
[02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:14.121]  Also, hello?
[02:17:14.421 --> 02:17:14.781]  Yes, sir.
[02:17:15.962 --> 02:17:19.425]  Also, I was looking at the genocide that happened in Rwanda.
[02:17:20.419 --> 02:17:23.202]  You think something like that could happen in America?
[02:17:23.382 --> 02:17:24.122]  Well, exactly.
[02:17:24.203 --> 02:17:27.626]  That's why they don't want the general public having guns, because then they can do whatever they want.
[02:17:27.666 --> 02:17:28.426]  And yes, the U.N.
[02:17:28.486 --> 02:17:33.071]  funded the genocide in Rwanda against the Christians and killed 400,000 to 500,000 of them.
[02:17:33.371 --> 02:17:34.792]  And then the U.N.
[02:17:34.832 --> 02:17:39.116]  posed like the Savior when it was videotaped and photographed and came out in court that the U.N.
[02:17:39.176 --> 02:17:42.219]  ran the whole slaughter operation one year after taking the guns.
[02:17:42.579 --> 02:17:44.141]  The Christians owned most of the property.
[02:17:44.181 --> 02:17:47.123]  They were a minority of black people because they didn't kill each other.
[02:17:47.143 --> 02:17:47.704]  They were loving.
[02:17:48.004 --> 02:18:00.053]  They gave the animist and others jobs, the occultist jobs, and the occultist, who are like 75% of the population, were given UN weapons, and the UN came in and redistributed wealth, created class envy.
[02:18:00.733 --> 02:18:06.157]  Listen, the Amish in places in South America, two different countries, are less than 2% of the population.
[02:18:06.377 --> 02:18:07.939]  They produce almost all the food.
[02:18:08.857 --> 02:18:10.938]  In whatever country they're in, when it's a small country.
[02:18:11.398 --> 02:18:17.199]  And there's been moves to kick them out of different areas of South America, but the governments won't let them.
[02:18:17.559 --> 02:18:22.641]  Because there's so much class envy, and the communists want the Amish out, who don't do anything but grow all the food.
[02:18:22.661 --> 02:18:24.061]  And it's the same thing.
[02:18:24.381 --> 02:18:28.723]  In Rwanda, the Christians ran everything, because they weren't cutthroat scum.
[02:18:29.763 --> 02:18:30.423]  And you know what?
[02:18:30.463 --> 02:18:31.363]  They murdered them.
[02:18:31.403 --> 02:18:32.884]  They murdered them, they murdered them.
[02:18:33.104 --> 02:18:36.505]  The UN again murdered all the Christians, because they hate Christians.
[02:18:36.525 --> 02:18:36.845]  Go ahead.
[02:18:39.409 --> 02:18:42.572]  And I wanted to bring another topic, may I?
[02:18:42.592 --> 02:18:44.834]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[02:18:45.275 --> 02:18:51.681]  Donald Trump, I know in the past you said that if he's for real, I don't know if he's for real, I don't know if I could trust him.
[02:18:52.222 --> 02:18:55.865]  Kind of like when Obama came and he promised change and it never happened.
[02:18:56.506 --> 02:18:58.167]  Because I usually vote Libertarian.
[02:18:58.388 --> 02:18:58.648]  Sure.
[02:18:58.768 --> 02:19:02.331]  But do you think Donald Trump is for real?
[02:19:04.344 --> 02:19:13.835]  I didn't think he was for real, but he's doing so much good with what he's saying, and is acting more like he actually wants to be president, that he may try to double-cross the establishment.
[02:19:14.175 --> 02:19:16.998]  But he's made money with the establishment, so I don't know if they'll let him.
[02:19:17.859 --> 02:19:19.861]  And if he is for real, he better watch his six.
[02:19:20.962 --> 02:19:23.966]  That said, he does make most of his money off a booming economy.
[02:19:24.924 --> 02:19:27.104]  And he is somebody that does employ a lot of Americans.
[02:19:27.765 --> 02:19:30.265]  So I just don't think he wants to see America go under.
[02:19:30.645 --> 02:19:34.386]  He sees how big it could be if he helped rescue the country and turn things around.
[02:19:35.706 --> 02:19:42.007]  And he said a lot of the right things on inoculations, on open borders, on ISIS, on taxes.
[02:19:42.027 --> 02:19:45.408]  I mean, Donald Trump is night and day compared to Hillary Clinton.
[02:19:45.848 --> 02:19:50.129]  If he implements one third of what he says he'll do, I would vote for him.
[02:19:50.189 --> 02:19:51.169]  He may double crosses.
[02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:53.952]  That's between him and God if he does that.
[02:19:55.054 --> 02:19:56.296]  But what do you think about Trump?
[02:19:58.319 --> 02:19:59.862]  I just don't trust him.
[02:20:00.623 --> 02:20:02.546]  He sounds good, but I don't know if I can trust him.
[02:20:02.566 --> 02:20:03.107]  No, I hear you.
[02:20:03.167 --> 02:20:05.150]  Listen, he said he loves Hillary Clinton.
[02:20:06.529 --> 02:20:07.891]  I don't know why, I just like it.
[02:20:08.112 --> 02:20:09.714]  Well, something's wrong with him.
[02:20:09.954 --> 02:20:12.377]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.

[02:22:12.288 --> 02:22:15.510]  Their age should give them a great advantage to feeling good all the time.
[02:22:15.890 --> 02:22:21.514]  However, young people of today are dealing with the same nutrient-deficient food as everyone else in America.

[02:22:33.061 --> 02:22:36.003]  At the end of a tiring work shift, I used to not do much around the house.
[02:22:36.243 --> 02:22:46.374]  Since I started taking the new Technology Enhance One World Way after work, I have so much energy when I get home that I'm able to take long walks, do chores, and even honey to-do lists from the wife.
[02:22:46.634 --> 02:22:51.159]  It's plenty enough energy to get things done around the house and time to settle down before bedtime.

[02:24:14.711 --> 02:24:17.615]  Ira Hayes, Ira Hayes
[02:24:35.687 --> 02:24:42.509]  If I sound desperate sometimes, it's because I am.
[02:24:42.609 --> 02:24:49.430]  We're witnessing the total dismantlement of the free market and prosperity, the blowing of all of our power systems and industry.
[02:24:50.670 --> 02:24:53.071]  We're watching a globalist corporate military takeover.
[02:24:54.377 --> 02:25:04.467]  And I say the military's waking up because they're trying to get them prepared to go after the American people, so of course they've woken up some, but if we don't do anything and get vocal, the troops will be purged.
[02:25:05.548 --> 02:25:08.911]  And in the process, they will hire people that will take part in this takeover.
[02:25:10.733 --> 02:25:13.456]  And the biggest problem is also a positive, in a way.
[02:25:13.876 --> 02:25:15.337]  We have such prosperity.
[02:25:15.377 --> 02:25:18.721]  We have the poorest American, the poorest Westerner.
[02:25:19.696 --> 02:25:25.821]  Has more food, more entertainment, more shelter than kings had a thousand years ago.
[02:25:26.782 --> 02:25:28.884]  Than kings had 500 years ago.
[02:25:29.704 --> 02:25:31.586]  The fantastical things we get to do.
[02:25:32.126 --> 02:25:36.490]  There's so much good in the world that our ancestors fought to develop.
[02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:38.051]  Of every race, color, and creed.
[02:25:38.874 --> 02:25:45.122]  Humans from all parts of the world have contributed to the amazing, fantastical, magical world we live in.
[02:25:46.064 --> 02:25:48.527]  So the world is beautiful, the world is great, the world is good.
[02:25:48.747 --> 02:25:54.475]  There's just bad at the top of it, trying to now devolve humanity and take control.
[02:25:57.628 --> 02:26:01.090]  And so we have to really get through our heads how bad the situation is.
[02:26:01.470 --> 02:26:02.650]  And I know most of you know that.
[02:26:02.670 --> 02:26:07.512]  We've got a caller out here, we're about to go to Rich in New York saying, time for talking is over.
[02:26:08.053 --> 02:26:08.753]  Action needed.
[02:26:11.034 --> 02:26:12.195]  But what is the action?
[02:26:12.215 --> 02:26:13.635]  People always say, I should take action.
[02:26:13.675 --> 02:26:14.436]  What is the action?
[02:26:14.876 --> 02:26:23.840]  Banner hangs, pirate radio, running for office, bullhorning people, suing people, getting aggressive, not complying.
[02:26:24.818 --> 02:26:25.859]  Supporting good people.
[02:26:26.420 --> 02:26:27.621]  Not supporting bad people.
[02:26:27.681 --> 02:26:30.683]  I mean, just living your life to realize there's a war going on.
[02:26:30.743 --> 02:26:33.406]  A covert, cold war that's getting hot.
[02:26:35.287 --> 02:26:36.408]  And not being intimidated.
[02:26:36.468 --> 02:26:38.150]  Not hiding and getting a bunch of guns ready.
[02:26:39.171 --> 02:26:43.335]  I would get guns ready, and I would get food ready, and I'd get water ready, and I'd get ready for an organized collapse.
[02:26:43.655 --> 02:26:44.836]  We're fighting to not have that happen.
[02:26:45.116 --> 02:26:46.537]  But that's a defense move.
[02:26:46.597 --> 02:26:47.118]  I'd be 90% offense.
[02:26:50.114 --> 02:26:51.697]  We need to be in the info war.
[02:26:51.757 --> 02:26:53.520]  They want to shut our speech down for a reason.
[02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:54.642]  We are hurting these people.
[02:26:55.223 --> 02:26:56.966]  Because they're so ridiculously bad.
[02:26:58.469 --> 02:27:00.032]  Rich in New York, thanks for calling.
[02:27:00.052 --> 02:27:01.033]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:27:02.833 --> 02:27:03.714]  Yeah, Alex, how you doing?
[02:27:03.734 --> 02:27:09.479]  Well, I guess you kind of answered my question in a way, but also, I mean, come on, these guys are making their own laws.
[02:27:09.839 --> 02:27:12.722]  I mean, the laws are for us, they're not for them to follow.
[02:27:12.742 --> 02:27:17.726]  I know, but they're going to misrepresent it if we start breaking their phony laws to go after them.
[02:27:18.046 --> 02:27:21.189]  We have to first educate the public that the president's even a puppet.
[02:27:21.449 --> 02:27:23.912]  If the president got hurt, it'd make him a martyr.
[02:27:24.392 --> 02:27:26.755]  We've got to identify George Soros, the globalist.
[02:27:27.055 --> 02:27:28.557]  We've got to identify Al Gore.
[02:27:28.778 --> 02:27:31.381]  We've got to identify the people that are actually running the show.
[02:27:31.401 --> 02:27:32.082]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:27:32.282 --> 02:27:34.505]  And then we've got to politically annihilate them.
[02:27:35.025 --> 02:27:35.326]  Go ahead.
[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:50.615]  Well, that makes sense, um, but I was thinking of a, you know, a citizen response team, so when you have a problem, just get enough people to show up and, uh, like the, for example, the Bundy Ranch, a perfect example of that.
[02:27:50.635 --> 02:27:54.159]  You know, you had people come together, stand in there, and they succeeded.
[02:27:54.179 --> 02:27:55.400]  And we were on the front lines of that.
[02:27:55.540 --> 02:27:55.760]  Yes he is.
[02:28:14.697 --> 02:28:23.503]  Alex, I just think that if something happens like what happens over in Europe and these Muslims come in, think they're going to pull that crap over here, they're going to be in for a very rude awakening.
[02:28:23.863 --> 02:28:32.349]  I know, but then they're going to have Homeland Security probably persecute non-radical Muslims, blow up a mosque full of them and blame the patriots, then guilting us to submitting to them.
[02:28:32.929 --> 02:28:35.071]  See, we're up against a very dirty...
[02:28:35.891 --> 02:28:36.432]  Opponent here.
[02:28:37.092 --> 02:28:41.697]  So every move that people at a grassroots think might work is not going to do well.
[02:28:42.257 --> 02:28:47.802]  Let them pull a Lexington or a Concord, shoot up a bunch of Patriots first, and believe me, they're itching for a fight.
[02:28:48.303 --> 02:28:49.344]  Let them strike first.
[02:28:49.384 --> 02:28:51.646]  People go, how dare you say let them strike first?
[02:28:51.746 --> 02:28:52.206]  Believe me.
[02:28:53.127 --> 02:29:03.942]  Letting them strike us first, even letting them arrest a bunch of people and start persecution, is going to absolutely green light people in the military and the government to go on the offense.
[02:29:04.343 --> 02:29:05.745]  And our people are everywhere.
[02:29:05.945 --> 02:29:06.385]  Believe me.
[02:29:07.589 --> 02:29:09.230]  Our people have kept their mouths shut.
[02:29:09.330 --> 02:29:10.571]  They're embedded in everything.
[02:29:10.851 --> 02:29:12.032]  They don't follow orders.
[02:29:12.092 --> 02:29:13.133]  There are no cells.
[02:29:13.733 --> 02:29:16.195]  We follow the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[02:29:16.475 --> 02:29:17.416]  We are America.
[02:29:17.796 --> 02:29:18.977]  We are everywhere.
[02:29:19.537 --> 02:29:20.458]  And the New World Order knows it.
[02:29:20.478 --> 02:29:22.559]  That's why they're scared to blow up a federal building and blame it on us.
[02:29:22.879 --> 02:29:26.141]  They know we're going to be there minute one exposing their false flag.
[02:29:26.442 --> 02:29:31.605]  There isn't a lot they can pull right now because we got them in check at every level.
[02:29:32.045 --> 02:29:33.646]  I just got chills because that isn't hype.
[02:29:33.707 --> 02:29:36.849]  We are in a savage death battle with these people.
[02:29:38.390 --> 02:29:40.611]  And I'm telling you, the things we don't understand, they're shutting down.
[02:29:41.091 --> 02:29:46.975]  They are shutting down our education, shutting down our health, shutting down our power plants, trying to shut down our farms.
[02:29:47.255 --> 02:29:50.877]  But America is so strong, we're still starting to pull through it.
[02:29:51.178 --> 02:29:53.579]  It's the cultural brainwashing that's the real rot.
[02:29:54.180 --> 02:29:58.482]  It's all of the decadence that they're spewing on our young people that is their only hope.
[02:29:59.183 --> 02:30:00.063]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.564 --> 02:30:02.165]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.085 --> 02:30:05.767]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.795 --> 02:30:13.359]  What exactly is political correctness, and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[02:30:13.559 --> 02:30:19.625]  Well, political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses to control public opinion.
[02:30:19.745 --> 02:30:28.674]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda, but to also ensure that your government-created viewpoint also influences others in a ripple effect.
[02:30:28.914 --> 02:30:31.196]  This is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[02:30:31.336 --> 02:30:34.958]  They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple.
[02:30:35.178 --> 02:30:38.740]  And over time, we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception.
[02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:42.082]  But how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[02:30:42.283 --> 02:30:52.289]  Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth, such as global warming, for example.
[02:30:52.489 --> 02:31:01.412]  Then the establishment suppresses any counter-arguments to their agenda by calling critics kooky, nutjobs, racists, or in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[02:31:01.672 --> 02:31:07.994]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and our YouTube channel, Resistance News.
[02:31:08.174 --> 02:31:09.374]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[02:31:09.654 --> 02:31:12.855]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:13.155 --> 02:31:18.217]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[02:31:18.297 --> 02:31:18.957]  We're good to go.
[02:31:39.508 --> 02:31:40.448]  BrainForce is here.
[02:31:40.629 --> 02:31:42.729]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:31:42.849 --> 02:31:47.572]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:31:47.832 --> 02:31:49.492]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[02:31:49.532 --> 02:31:50.973]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:31:51.113 --> 02:31:54.335]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:31:54.615 --> 02:31:56.395]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:31:56.576 --> 02:31:57.496]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:31:57.516 --> 02:31:58.456]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:31:58.476 --> 02:32:00.577]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:32:00.697 --> 02:32:06.300]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:32:09.261 --> 02:32:10.041]  Alex Jones here.

[02:32:26.866 --> 02:32:28.447]  The globalists want us dependent.
[02:32:28.607 --> 02:32:30.087]  We need to be self-sufficient.
[02:32:30.207 --> 02:32:35.369]  And if you don't have high-quality, long-lasting, storable foods, I believe you're making a huge mistake.
[02:32:35.549 --> 02:32:38.051]  My goal is to find the best deals and bring it to you.

[02:32:54.907 --> 02:32:59.951]  A decision is being made by the President and the Joint Chiefs in the War Room at the Pentagon.
[02:33:00.131 --> 02:33:00.891]  And when they realize
[02:33:23.226 --> 02:33:25.548]  There is no possibility of recalling the wing.
[02:33:26.268 --> 02:33:29.810]  There will be only one course of action, O. Total commitment.
[02:33:30.611 --> 02:33:34.213]  Mandryk, do you recall what Clemenceau once said about war?
[02:33:35.394 --> 02:33:38.376]  No, I didn't think I knew what he was talking about.
[02:33:38.396 --> 02:33:41.038]  He said war was too important to be left to the generals.
[02:33:41.918 --> 02:33:46.061]  When he said that, fifty years ago, he might have been right.
[02:33:46.881 --> 02:33:50.824]  But today, war is too important to be left to politicians.
[02:33:51.889 --> 02:33:58.096]  They have neither the time, the training, nor the inclination for strategic thought.
[02:33:59.837 --> 02:34:03.361]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:34:03.922 --> 02:34:05.443]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:34:18.797 --> 02:34:25.259]  And the Russians are preparing their nuclear forces for a nuclear war that's been announced yesterday in Russia with emergency meetings.
[02:34:26.559 --> 02:34:34.101]  Nuclear weapons are being moved by NATO up to their border as Soros commands right-wing fascist forces in the ongoing proxy war with U.S.
[02:34:34.121 --> 02:34:43.403]  Special Forces, advising and commanding Ukrainian forces battling, obviously, on the borders of Russia right now.
[02:34:45.165 --> 02:34:49.247]  The psychos that hate our guns, hate our Bibles, also hate Russia.
[02:34:50.347 --> 02:34:51.167]  And they hate Christians.
[02:34:53.068 --> 02:34:54.989]  And Russia has had an orthodox revival.
[02:34:57.570 --> 02:35:09.194]  And the word is, it's not propaganda, Putin is basically an admitted Christian, but actually follows different religious leaders and believes that this could be the end of the world.
[02:35:10.314 --> 02:35:11.115]  And it's not like
[02:35:12.671 --> 02:35:19.915]  With the radical Islamists just wanting to make the end of the world happen, Putin is now becoming concerned that this could be the start of what causes the end of the world.
[02:35:21.316 --> 02:35:24.017]  Because if you look at the elites we have running things, they are psychotic.
[02:35:25.097 --> 02:35:27.078]  They are mentally ill, they are very dangerous.
[02:35:27.899 --> 02:35:32.221]  A caller asked from New York, what Rich, a very good question, what is your line in the sand?
[02:35:33.402 --> 02:35:39.465]  How do you take the gloves off without giving the enemy something that allows them to demonize the liberty movement?
[02:35:43.055 --> 02:35:51.143]  You don't follow what George Soros is saying, which revolution equals walk up to a cop walking out of a gas station and shoot him in the head.
[02:35:52.024 --> 02:35:52.765]  Or shoot him in the back.
[02:35:57.229 --> 02:35:59.011]  That's what is pushed by the left.
[02:36:02.094 --> 02:36:05.978]  Because that's just going to destroy the local police departments, make them fall apart during the takeover.
[02:36:08.866 --> 02:36:15.029]  Now, if the local police want to be federalized during a civil war and want to try to stop you and drag you off to a FEMA camp, they'll just hand you over to the army truck.
[02:36:15.689 --> 02:36:18.571]  You know, sorry for them, you've got to make that decision what you're going to do at that time.
[02:36:18.631 --> 02:36:19.311]  It's not going to be pretty.
[02:36:20.072 --> 02:36:24.314]  And there's not going to be a lot of cops out on the highway in about three or four days after that starts doing that anymore.
[02:36:25.454 --> 02:36:28.156]  And I wish to God we could get the word out to stop this from happening.
[02:36:28.336 --> 02:36:34.799]  But let me tell you, that's the plan, is to start a civil war between the patriots and the police, and then let them get chewed up in a fight with us.
[02:36:36.032 --> 02:36:38.980]  They want to use the police as their little paramilitary militia.
[02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:41.621]  In the takedown of this country.
[02:36:41.821 --> 02:36:45.283]  So we better be going to the police station, going to the sheriff's department.
[02:36:45.623 --> 02:36:53.108]  It should be raining DVDs and films and information and New American Magazine and my show and my interviews.
[02:36:53.568 --> 02:36:54.749]  They should be knee-deep in it.
[02:36:55.149 --> 02:36:56.910]  And by the way, they are knee-deep in it.
[02:36:57.290 --> 02:37:07.897]  We need to hammer them with the truth so hard that when the Southern Poverty Law Center walks in and says everything we've told them out of their own mouths, the cops go, well, these patriots know what they're talking about.
[02:37:10.529 --> 02:37:16.597]  I keep going back to this because, remember those Democratic fundraiser letters that even Fox News covered three years ago?
[02:37:16.617 --> 02:37:19.720]  Where they said, don't worry that we're down in the polls.
[02:37:20.321 --> 02:37:25.588]  There's going to be terror attacks by the Tea Party, like Oklahoma City, and they're going to be very unpopular.
[02:37:26.829 --> 02:37:28.872]  Now it's been three years and they haven't pulled that off yet.
[02:37:29.841 --> 02:37:32.064]  But let me tell you, who's prime suspects when it happens?
[02:37:32.524 --> 02:37:33.445]  Who stands to gain?
[02:37:33.766 --> 02:37:34.707]  Who's got a history of it?
[02:37:35.067 --> 02:37:39.132]  You think they're going to have Al Qaeda launch nerve gas attacks that kill thousands and blame Assad?
[02:37:39.433 --> 02:37:40.995]  And they won't do something to us?
[02:37:41.515 --> 02:37:43.357]  They hate us way more than Assad!
[02:37:44.279 --> 02:37:45.500]  Use your head, people!
[02:37:45.700 --> 02:37:46.782]  This is so obvious!
[02:37:50.362 --> 02:37:54.244]  And you know, people ask how I keep my energy up, because when I'm off air, I'm not like this.
[02:37:54.264 --> 02:37:58.465]  I was just talking to Buckley and Anthony back there doing work, and they said, man, you're bouncing off the walls, you're in the brakes.
[02:37:58.825 --> 02:37:59.786]  You had too much coffee today?
[02:37:59.806 --> 02:38:00.466]  And I said, no!
[02:38:02.107 --> 02:38:04.128]  I realize how much power good people have.
[02:38:04.248 --> 02:38:06.969]  I realize what I've been able to do in 20 years, and I'm nobody.
[02:38:08.009 --> 02:38:09.050]  I realize what you can do.
[02:38:09.170 --> 02:38:10.950]  I don't want these people to win!
[02:38:12.311 --> 02:38:19.274]  You walk into a Super Bowl game, everybody's got money on the table, and all the men are standing up during the key plays going, come on, come on, don't lose, oh, oh yeah!
[02:38:20.399 --> 02:38:21.420]  I don't do that for that!
[02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:22.461]  This is America!
[02:38:22.481 --> 02:38:23.441]  This is our children!
[02:38:23.641 --> 02:38:25.583]  This is forced inoculation, people!
[02:38:26.944 --> 02:38:28.165]  This is world government!
[02:38:28.905 --> 02:38:39.453]  They're inoculating, what is it, eight different countries in Latin America with shots right now we know are linked to autoimmune disorders, neurological disorders, and infertility.
[02:38:41.955 --> 02:38:45.698]  I get savagely angry thinking about all those young women being sterilized.
[02:38:47.591 --> 02:38:49.353]  People will call me crazed because of that.
[02:38:49.613 --> 02:39:03.728]  It makes me physically ill to then see Mecha and La Raza race baiting and brainwashing Hispanics and others when they know full well at the top it's a eugenics operation to have Hispanics in their clutches to absolutely jack the living daylights out of them.
[02:39:08.459 --> 02:39:09.400]  Oh yeah, the latest article.
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:15.185]  Oh, another girl's in the hospital paralyzed after a flu shot, and the doctors say, we don't know what did it, the family claims it happened.
[02:39:15.386 --> 02:39:19.309]  But the insert says it can paralyze you.
[02:39:23.393 --> 02:39:27.857]  But the media acts like we don't know.
[02:39:31.621 --> 02:39:32.041]  It's sick.
[02:39:33.123 --> 02:39:33.844]  It's freakish.
[02:39:34.405 --> 02:39:35.266]  It's disgusting.
[02:39:35.607 --> 02:39:36.528]  It's ridiculous.
[02:39:36.868 --> 02:39:38.811]  Bill Gates is calling for socialism.
[02:39:38.831 --> 02:39:39.893]  Let me cover this on one of your calls.
[02:39:40.153 --> 02:39:40.674]  Steven and others.
[02:39:42.376 --> 02:39:45.981]  Robert Reich and all these other disgusting pieces of trash.
[02:39:47.039 --> 02:39:48.300]  They've never worked a day in their lives.
[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:51.102]  Bill Gates was given Microsoft by IBM.
[02:39:51.202 --> 02:39:51.762]  All was set up.
[02:39:51.782 --> 02:39:53.383]  His dad was the head of Planned Parenthood.
[02:39:54.144 --> 02:39:55.064]  Army intelligence.
[02:39:55.124 --> 02:39:56.325]  I mean, it's a total cutout.
[02:39:56.385 --> 02:39:57.065]  It's all fake.
[02:39:57.145 --> 02:39:58.166]  I know people inside.
[02:39:58.206 --> 02:39:58.967]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[02:39:59.427 --> 02:40:00.468]  I told you about this years ago.
[02:40:00.508 --> 02:40:01.048]  It's now admitted.
[02:40:01.368 --> 02:40:03.009]  He's a tax-exempt little bastard.
[02:40:03.329 --> 02:40:04.150]  He's a front man.
[02:40:04.370 --> 02:40:05.251]  He's a corporate head.
[02:40:05.451 --> 02:40:06.191]  He's a nobody.
[02:40:06.251 --> 02:40:07.392]  He built nothing.
[02:40:07.652 --> 02:40:08.733]  He is nothing.
[02:40:09.701 --> 02:40:18.794]  Remember his wife last year was in Germany, gave a speech and said, those of you claiming we're running a secret eugenics operation and all this, you better stop it or people are gonna die.
[02:40:19.075 --> 02:40:21.298]  And folks went, what does she mean by people are gonna die?
[02:40:21.538 --> 02:40:23.541]  Like if they don't carry out their operations, they're gonna die?
[02:40:23.841 --> 02:40:25.664]  No, she was threatening me!
[02:40:29.124 --> 02:40:30.885]  She was threatening those of us that know!
[02:40:30.905 --> 02:40:35.827]  Why do you think people know all this about Bill Gates now and his secret meetings on population control?
[02:40:36.368 --> 02:40:38.469]  Because we've blown their operation wide open!
[02:40:38.609 --> 02:40:39.529]  Because we don't care!
[02:40:39.709 --> 02:40:40.730]  We'll go up against him!
[02:40:41.350 --> 02:40:42.370]  I hate Bill Gates!
[02:40:42.691 --> 02:40:43.371]  I hate him!
[02:40:43.391 --> 02:40:45.812]  He's a murderer!
[02:40:45.832 --> 02:40:50.574]  I'm not shutting up!
[02:40:50.815 --> 02:40:51.855]  I'm not backing down!
[02:40:52.015 --> 02:40:53.276]  I'm on a collision course!
[02:40:55.917 --> 02:40:57.338]  Feel your hands, scum!
[02:40:58.615 --> 02:41:01.258]  I'm not gonna sit here and watch you murder everybody.
[02:41:02.379 --> 02:41:14.411]  His vaccines, all over the world, everywhere, from Africa to Pakistan, they give girls those shots, they give boys those shots, massive numbers get paralyzed, mainstream news, and they go, we don't know, it's not polio, they're just paralyzed.
[02:41:14.731 --> 02:41:15.852]  Yes, it's polio!
[02:41:16.152 --> 02:41:20.457]  My grandmother got polio three weeks after she took the shots in the middle of the 1950s!
[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:29.102]  She's been in excruciating pain ever since!
[02:41:29.122 --> 02:41:30.223]  She's 90 years old!
[02:41:30.643 --> 02:41:31.364]  Scumbags!
[02:41:49.443 --> 02:41:51.666]  You think some skeleton... You know why I don't like Halloween?
[02:41:51.886 --> 02:41:55.991]  You hang some skeleton outside your door and it goes... You know what's scary?
[02:41:56.171 --> 02:42:00.516]  These little old men like Bill Gates and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett.
[02:42:00.616 --> 02:42:02.358]  I know full well who they are.
[02:42:02.819 --> 02:42:04.381]  Sick, savage, evil people.
[02:42:06.664 --> 02:42:12.530]  People go, well, there are too many people in Latin America, Alex, and Africa, and, you know, it's always liberals.
[02:42:12.550 --> 02:42:16.954]  You know, you say you don't want to open borders or to pay for these people, but why do you want them here?
[02:42:17.134 --> 02:42:17.675]  Well, here's the difference.
[02:42:17.835 --> 02:42:19.977]  I'm not going to let them be used as weapons against me.
[02:42:20.478 --> 02:42:24.722]  I'm not going to sit there and watch them as a brainwashed horde come here and vote to take my guns.
[02:42:25.002 --> 02:42:29.527]  I'm going to do my best to educate them and inform them, but I'm not going to sign on to sterilizing them.
[02:42:30.738 --> 02:42:31.458]  Isn't it sick?
[02:42:31.999 --> 02:42:36.601]  And by the way, I'll tell these so-called liberals, I'll go, you know, you want my guns because you want to conquer me too.
[02:42:37.021 --> 02:42:39.322]  You have a will to dominate, a will to conquer.
[02:42:39.382 --> 02:42:40.482]  You hate your fellow man.
[02:42:40.502 --> 02:42:57.330]  Do you think I'm going to get on board something thinking I'm going to covertly act like a liberal and get off on killing all the blacks, 52% of them before they're born and kill the Mexicans and kill all these Africans and kill all these people because I'm quote white when you're targeting white people just as much.
[02:42:57.910 --> 02:43:01.752]  You're playing everybody off against each other so the ruling class can play God.
[02:43:01.972 --> 02:43:03.112]  You people are sick!
[02:43:03.532 --> 02:43:06.133]  You just want to kill people and you think it's cute.
[02:43:06.173 --> 02:43:14.077]  You're imagining you're part of some winning team because you're a eugenicist and you think you're going to get into the Valhalla?
[02:43:14.537 --> 02:43:16.238]  You think you're going to Elysium?
[02:43:16.558 --> 02:43:21.520]  You think you're going to the next level that the elite aren't going to totally screw you over as well?
[02:43:21.860 --> 02:43:23.741]  What is your problem, idiot?
[02:43:24.341 --> 02:43:27.864]  You don't understand that when you engage in evil, it comes back on you?
[02:43:27.884 --> 02:43:30.427]  You really think you're on a winning team?
[02:43:30.667 --> 02:43:35.431]  You really think the devil is gonna deliver to you and your family in the end?
[02:43:38.454 --> 02:43:40.195]  Prosperity would deliver.
[02:43:40.335 --> 02:43:41.396]  God would deliver.
[02:43:41.536 --> 02:43:42.898]  Freedom would deliver.
[02:43:43.018 --> 02:43:45.240]  More than the devil would ever deliver, you idiot.
[02:43:46.598 --> 02:43:54.482]  The devil gives you what God already gave you, and then twists it, and puts a back door in it, and gives it to you to bring you down!
[02:43:55.922 --> 02:43:58.043]  The devil doesn't give you the power!
[02:43:59.724 --> 02:44:04.226]  The devil has stolen the world and distorted it, and he can only give you poison!
[02:44:05.347 --> 02:44:07.668]  Everything the devil gives you is bad!
[02:44:08.228 --> 02:44:10.009]  And if you don't believe in the devil, fine!
[02:44:10.389 --> 02:44:12.330]  But what puts women in cages?
[02:44:13.573 --> 02:44:15.355]  What has missile shields against the Russians?
[02:44:15.595 --> 02:44:15.815]  Evil.
[02:44:16.136 --> 02:44:17.637]  What sells baby body parts?
[02:44:17.838 --> 02:44:18.058]  Evil.
[02:44:18.518 --> 02:44:22.783]  What tries to dumb people down and teaches them 5 plus 5 plus 5 doesn't equal 15?
[02:44:23.023 --> 02:44:24.284]  That was common core last week.
[02:44:25.506 --> 02:44:30.131]  National curriculum that 5 plus 5 plus 5 equals 15 is a wrong answer.
[02:44:30.912 --> 02:44:32.854]  That is the essence of evil.
[02:44:34.483 --> 02:44:38.587]  Jacking with people's brains, turning them into mentally ill basket cases.
[02:44:38.908 --> 02:44:43.512]  I'm now running into college students that are mentally ill basket cases.
[02:44:44.333 --> 02:44:46.155]  Sputtering political correctness out of their mouths.
[02:44:46.455 --> 02:44:50.879]  They don't know science, they don't know literature, they don't know anything!
[02:44:50.980 --> 02:44:53.042]  They just know how to act intellectual!
[02:44:54.861 --> 02:45:02.145]  I also run into these men all the time that if they're big and strong they sort of fight with you and as soon as you're ready to fight them they back off because they didn't want to actually get in a fight.
[02:45:02.686 --> 02:45:09.209]  They wanted to imagine they were tough like it was a video game and have a simulated fight with somebody.
[02:45:09.830 --> 02:45:18.134]  And while all these video games like Battlefront, The Force Awakens, all the rest of this stuff, all my son's friends, he's 13, wanted to play this with him.
[02:45:18.395 --> 02:45:20.976]  And I went and I said, let's listen to these gamers play this.
[02:45:21.416 --> 02:45:22.117]  Now let's hear these ads.
[02:45:22.137 --> 02:45:22.637]  And I go, watch.
[02:45:22.657 --> 02:45:23.618]  I want you to do a report on this.
[02:45:24.420 --> 02:45:33.753]  And it's all about, be a leader, lead the battles, fight the enemies, you can be a soldier, you can go to foreign galaxies, you can be a winner, and all that sort of thing.
[02:45:33.773 --> 02:45:36.196]  And I go, what are they telling you?
[02:45:36.337 --> 02:45:38.339]  And he goes, this was this weekend.
[02:45:39.241 --> 02:45:39.962]  It was like it was Friday.
[02:45:41.325 --> 02:45:41.745]  Friday night.
[02:45:42.185 --> 02:45:53.250]  He goes, they're telling me to live in an artificial reality where I'll never actually develop myself, and where I'll also be conditioned, engaging in simulated killings, and I'll also have my psychological activities tracked and everything else.
[02:45:53.270 --> 02:45:55.911]  Because he listens to the show, he obviously knows it all.
[02:45:56.011 --> 02:45:57.832]  Smarter than I am, definitely.
[02:45:57.892 --> 02:46:00.193]  All dads say that, but he really is better than me, in many ways.
[02:46:00.613 --> 02:46:01.374]  Too smart, actually.
[02:46:02.574 --> 02:46:03.575]  And, frighteningly smart.
[02:46:03.855 --> 02:46:04.715]  And I said, that's right.
[02:46:04.735 --> 02:46:06.656]  I said, do you really want to play with your friends now doing this?
[02:46:06.676 --> 02:46:08.197]  He said, do you want to go to the paintball?
[02:46:09.270 --> 02:46:09.930]  You want to go hiking?
[02:46:09.950 --> 02:46:11.171]  You want to go camping with your friends?
[02:46:11.211 --> 02:46:12.832]  Try to get your friends out of this, son.
[02:46:12.852 --> 02:46:15.373]  I said, but you know what?
[02:46:16.253 --> 02:46:17.354]  I'll get you Battlefront.
[02:46:19.034 --> 02:46:22.616]  And if you really want to play it, we can play it.
[02:46:22.636 --> 02:46:24.957]  But I said, we're really going to get it so we can play it and do a report on it.
[02:46:26.397 --> 02:46:32.380]  And then maybe you can start playing games and do some good while you're at it and shoot videos for YouTube talking about the propaganda of different games.
[02:46:32.420 --> 02:46:33.160]  He said, that's a great idea.
[02:46:33.180 --> 02:46:34.721]  I said, yeah, that's what we want you to do.
[02:46:35.061 --> 02:46:37.002]  So let's take that and let's do something good with it.
[02:46:39.744 --> 02:46:44.807]  It's not bad to play these games, but you need to understand if you're doing it more than an hour a day or so, it's mental illness.
[02:46:45.227 --> 02:46:48.249]  And it destroys your mind, it destroys your neural connections, that's a fact.
[02:46:48.669 --> 02:46:59.635]  Now I know I'm pontificating and ranting, it's just... The modern Stalins, the modern Maos, the modern Hitlers are Bill and Melinda Gates.
[02:47:00.435 --> 02:47:01.195]  Are Warren Buffett.
[02:47:01.235 --> 02:47:03.457]  I mean, they have it out for us, they think they're better than us.
[02:47:04.257 --> 02:47:05.618]  And I hate watching a con game.
[02:47:06.485 --> 02:47:08.167]  I hate watching somebody get swindled out of their money.
[02:47:08.447 --> 02:47:10.589]  I've been in a parking lot multiple times.
[02:47:11.550 --> 02:47:12.691]  This almost happened to me in college.
[02:47:14.212 --> 02:47:15.213]  But then somebody warned me.
[02:47:16.074 --> 02:47:19.858]  In a parking lot, I'm in college, these guys run, they go, man, we gotta sell some theater speakers.
[02:47:19.878 --> 02:47:22.881]  They're like $1,000, but these people didn't take the delivery.
[02:47:23.141 --> 02:47:25.223]  And they're only 200 bucks, they're really nice big speakers.
[02:47:25.763 --> 02:47:29.187]  And a guy walks up in a plumber outfit and he goes,
[02:47:30.356 --> 02:47:31.797]  Bro, don't listen to these scammers.
[02:47:31.817 --> 02:47:33.098]  Those are like $100 speakers.
[02:47:33.138 --> 02:47:34.719]  They're total paper crap.
[02:47:35.119 --> 02:47:35.739]  This is a scam.
[02:47:35.759 --> 02:47:36.520]  They run it all day.
[02:47:36.600 --> 02:47:38.501]  And the guys are like, if you man, this is a good deal.
[02:47:38.801 --> 02:47:39.682]  I was like, no, no, thank you.
[02:47:39.702 --> 02:47:40.863]  And then later I learned that was a scam.
[02:47:42.323 --> 02:47:43.904]  I've had them come to my door with that scam.
[02:47:44.905 --> 02:47:46.646]  And I'll go, no, I know they're cheap speakers.
[02:47:46.806 --> 02:47:47.347]  And then they flipped it.
[02:47:47.467 --> 02:47:48.627]  Are you saying I'm lying?
[02:47:49.228 --> 02:47:50.268]  It's always criminal types.
[02:47:50.809 --> 02:47:51.349]  They can be black.
[02:47:51.369 --> 02:47:52.150]  They can be white, whatever.
[02:47:52.170 --> 02:47:52.570]  It's criminals.
[02:47:53.615 --> 02:47:55.457]  It's always like ex-con types, kind of big guys.
[02:47:55.897 --> 02:48:02.284]  One time a guy put his hand on the door and I opened it up and I said, man, do that one more time and I'm going to really have to do something to you.
[02:48:03.025 --> 02:48:04.627]  I'm not warning you one more time.
[02:48:05.147 --> 02:48:06.409]  And I'm not trying to say I'm this tough guy.
[02:48:06.489 --> 02:48:07.810]  It's just what these scammers do.
[02:48:08.851 --> 02:48:11.714]  And those people, and I've seen them in parking lots, mainly with a woman.
[02:48:12.580 --> 02:48:17.945]  At least three times I can remember I'm in a parking lot and I see him standing there at the back of a lady's car.
[02:48:18.065 --> 02:48:20.106]  There's a van and they're like, just get the speakers.
[02:48:20.146 --> 02:48:20.727]  They're really good.
[02:48:20.747 --> 02:48:21.568]  Your son will love them.
[02:48:21.908 --> 02:48:22.308]  And you know what?
[02:48:22.328 --> 02:48:24.130]  A lot of people just ignore that and keep on moving.
[02:48:24.190 --> 02:48:25.071]  I know they're going to bow up.
[02:48:25.791 --> 02:48:27.973]  I go, ma'am, this is a well-known scam.
[02:48:29.254 --> 02:48:31.756]  And they're just trying to pressure sell you something with a great deal.
[02:48:31.796 --> 02:48:32.597]  Those speakers aren't worth $50.
[02:48:32.637 --> 02:48:35.880]  Mind your own business!
[02:48:36.060 --> 02:48:36.821]  Mind your own business!
[02:48:38.086 --> 02:48:42.008]  And they'll say, listen, now I don't blow up or say I'm going to fight them.
[02:48:42.028 --> 02:48:44.830]  I go, I'm about to call the police right now if you threaten me one more time.
[02:48:45.690 --> 02:48:47.651]  But before they get here, do something, go ahead.
[02:48:48.352 --> 02:48:49.793]  And I'm not looking for trouble.
[02:48:49.893 --> 02:48:52.414]  I don't want to get in a fight with 250 pound cons.
[02:48:53.215 --> 02:48:53.815]  But you know what?
[02:48:53.875 --> 02:48:55.696]  My soul won't let me roll over to them.
[02:48:55.716 --> 02:48:56.296]  You understand that?
[02:48:57.277 --> 02:48:58.257]  And that's what this comes down to.
[02:48:58.397 --> 02:48:59.058]  I'm in the fight.
[02:48:59.178 --> 02:48:59.938]  I know we can win.
[02:49:00.038 --> 02:49:01.119]  I know we can take them down.
[02:49:01.439 --> 02:49:06.142]  But can you imagine how angry I get at Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett, who are hardcore mafia?
[02:49:06.977 --> 02:49:10.898]  I mean, Warren Buffett is one of the biggest narcotics traffickers in the world.
[02:49:10.959 --> 02:49:13.279]  His banks launder hundreds of billions of money on record.
[02:49:13.319 --> 02:49:13.740]  Look it up.
[02:49:14.060 --> 02:49:16.921]  And they even got caught running the aircraft that shipped the drugs.
[02:49:17.601 --> 02:49:19.162]  He's a little non-threatening little man.
[02:49:19.942 --> 02:49:20.502]  I'm Warren Buffett.
[02:49:20.662 --> 02:49:22.523]  You think he likes me on air attacking him?
[02:49:23.263 --> 02:49:24.784]  I have to stand up against him.
[02:49:25.104 --> 02:49:26.044]  I gotta do it!
[02:49:28.165 --> 02:49:30.466]  Because there's nowhere to run, folks, if they keep winning.
[02:49:30.506 --> 02:49:32.567]  These are diabolical people.
[02:49:33.127 --> 02:49:34.267]  Diabolical.
[02:49:34.587 --> 02:49:35.888]  And I see right through them.
[02:49:36.892 --> 02:49:37.692]  Pray for us, please.
[02:49:37.712 --> 02:49:40.713]  I'm going to come back and take two segments of calls.
[02:49:42.914 --> 02:49:45.155]  Stephen and John and Phil and others.
[02:49:45.175 --> 02:49:47.196]  I'm going to briefly just plug for one minute this hour.

[02:50:01.039 --> 02:50:01.840]  It's an incredible deal.

[02:50:24.861 --> 02:50:26.884]  It's like the LifeStraw, but I think even better.
[02:50:28.146 --> 02:50:28.988]  And we sell both.
[02:50:29.028 --> 02:50:29.989]  They're all excellent.

[02:50:45.154 --> 02:50:46.615]  Absolutely amazing system as well.
[02:50:46.915 --> 02:50:47.795]  We only carry the best.

[02:50:53.638 --> 02:50:59.501]  And finally, I'm aggressive and it comes off as arrogant sometimes because my physiology, I'm smart.
[02:50:59.981 --> 02:51:01.404]  I know I'm risking my life every day.
[02:51:01.424 --> 02:51:02.686]  I know it's getting more serious.
[02:51:02.967 --> 02:51:04.409]  And it's actually animated.
[02:51:04.590 --> 02:51:05.992]  It's good to stand up to these people.
[02:51:06.153 --> 02:51:07.214]  It's good to not be a coward.
[02:51:07.475 --> 02:51:08.477]  I'm on fire!

[02:52:09.525 --> 02:52:13.007]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:52:13.747 --> 02:52:14.267]  It's true.
[02:52:14.367 --> 02:52:18.329]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:52:18.529 --> 02:52:20.390]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:52:20.930 --> 02:52:25.392]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:52:25.692 --> 02:52:38.307]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[02:53:00.075 --> 02:53:01.076]  For the love of clean water.
[02:53:09.218 --> 02:53:12.220]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[02:53:12.521 --> 02:53:17.685]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[02:53:18.025 --> 02:53:19.907]  But they're about to lose control.
[02:53:20.287 --> 02:53:25.291]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[02:53:25.611 --> 02:53:30.135]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[02:53:30.215 --> 02:53:32.237]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[02:53:32.257 --> 02:53:36.100]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[02:53:36.440 --> 02:53:40.505]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[02:53:40.946 --> 02:53:46.492]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves, but this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[02:53:46.672 --> 02:53:48.054]  This will affect us all.
[02:53:48.535 --> 02:53:52.019]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[02:53:53.240 --> 02:53:59.483]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.
[02:53:59.623 --> 02:54:05.526]  You can watch the video for free right now by going to dollardanger.com.
[02:54:05.746 --> 02:54:08.628]  Again, that's dollardanger.com.
[02:54:10.129 --> 02:54:13.691]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[02:54:13.711 --> 02:54:14.071]  I tried!
[02:54:17.711 --> 02:54:19.772]  People say, don't you know Rage Against The Machine is communist?
[02:54:19.812 --> 02:54:20.112]  Yeah.
[02:54:20.752 --> 02:54:23.053]  I'll take their propaganda and turn it right back on its head.
[02:54:23.073 --> 02:54:27.375]  That's what war is.
[02:54:28.015 --> 02:54:29.556]  Humans have never been communists.
[02:54:31.057 --> 02:54:34.738]  It's always been about free association.
[02:54:36.219 --> 02:54:37.920]  People don't control reality, you never will.
[02:54:39.540 --> 02:54:40.861]  You tried, but you failed.
[02:54:48.063 --> 02:54:49.304]  I didn't get to the Abbott News.
[02:54:49.344 --> 02:54:50.444]  Paul Watson's coming up to host.
[02:54:50.484 --> 02:54:52.426]  I'll have to cover more of this tomorrow, but I mentioned some of it.
[02:54:52.446 --> 02:54:53.907]  I want to go to calls this segment the next.
[02:54:55.167 --> 02:54:56.928]  I get crazed because I am crazed.
[02:54:57.269 --> 02:55:09.396]  It's normal to be crazed about this, and the show's successful because it wasn't calculated, but people needed to have the, you know, the primitive rabble-rousing with the intellectual facts that we back up.
[02:55:12.728 --> 02:55:16.911]  That's how people used to get folks motivated when they had to go off to war or whatever.
[02:55:17.131 --> 02:55:21.454]  And we need to get out of our comfort zone and get in the war, and know the war is happening.
[02:55:21.954 --> 02:55:25.897]  Let's go to Steven in California here on the air, then Gene and others.
[02:55:25.957 --> 02:55:26.257]  Go ahead.
[02:55:26.277 --> 02:55:27.918]  Hey Alex.
[02:55:28.418 --> 02:55:28.719]  Welcome.
[02:55:30.220 --> 02:55:32.841]  Colin from Communist California here, and I'm a first-time caller.
[02:55:32.921 --> 02:55:34.662]  I just wanted to say how much I love your products.
[02:55:35.043 --> 02:55:35.703]  Well, thank you, brother.
[02:55:35.723 --> 02:55:41.507]  I'm on DNA Force, Super Male Vitality, Deep Cleanse, Survival Shield,
[02:55:41.974 --> 02:55:43.935]  Appropriate filter for over the past year.
[02:55:44.375 --> 02:55:47.156]  I'm just so amazed by the accuracy of the information that you put out.
[02:55:47.656 --> 02:55:49.377]  I've been listening for like a year and a half now.
[02:55:49.957 --> 02:55:52.838]  And like, everything that you've said has just come to fruition.
[02:55:53.318 --> 02:55:54.958]  Like the surveillance blimp.
[02:55:56.019 --> 02:55:58.560]  Well sir, that was always partially declassified.
[02:55:58.580 --> 02:56:01.961]  They would just say it didn't exist nationally and say they were flying saucers.
[02:56:02.021 --> 02:56:08.243]  But they got blimps all over the country and yeah, it's amazing that it's a secret blimp with the Army watching us.
[02:56:09.827 --> 02:56:10.047]  Yeah.
[02:56:10.467 --> 02:56:11.488]  And now that we have a U.S.
[02:56:11.548 --> 02:56:18.232]  Navy missile instructor and many other experts confirming that the Earth is a flat and motionless plane... You're being sarcastic.
[02:56:18.532 --> 02:56:19.453]  That's a prank call.
[02:56:20.033 --> 02:56:28.198]  That's an ad hominem thing where people... There's seminar calls on that where you call in and then you say, oh, you're so accurate, you know, and then that adds something like the Earth's flat.
[02:56:28.238 --> 02:56:29.099]  It's a standard tactic.
[02:56:29.139 --> 02:56:34.262]  It's like when Al Gore was before Congress and they say, you know, the truth is the Earth's been cooling for a few years.
[02:56:34.802 --> 02:56:36.684]  And he goes, yes, and you think no one went to the moon.
[02:56:37.679 --> 02:56:39.920]  I'll be on national shows, they'll go, no one wants the moon, right Alex?
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:40.980]  And I'm like, no one wants the moon.
[02:56:42.021 --> 02:56:45.022]  They just put out some bad PR photos because the radiation damaged the film.
[02:56:45.042 --> 02:56:45.622]  They doctored them.
[02:56:46.063 --> 02:56:47.003]  They didn't admit it to people.
[02:56:48.244 --> 02:56:50.605]  Let's go to Gene in Florida.
[02:56:50.625 --> 02:56:51.145]  You're on the air.
[02:56:51.165 --> 02:56:51.545]  Go ahead.
[02:56:51.565 --> 02:56:54.726]  Hi, how you doing today?
[02:56:54.887 --> 02:56:55.367]  Good, brother.
[02:56:56.287 --> 02:56:56.607]  Or ma'am.
[02:56:56.667 --> 02:56:59.088]  Okay, first of all, first of all, that's okay.
[02:56:59.148 --> 02:57:02.730]  First of all, before we get going, I want to plug your iodine.
[02:57:04.247 --> 02:57:05.568]  I have lupus.
[02:57:05.988 --> 02:57:08.830]  I was diagnosed in 2001.
[02:57:10.210 --> 02:57:16.233]  I had been out of the sun since that time, because that's one of the first things they do is they take you out of the sun.
[02:57:16.253 --> 02:57:18.914]  I went on their medications.
[02:57:18.994 --> 02:57:24.037]  I took them for two years, and I decided I did not want to go that route, so I went natural.
[02:57:24.837 --> 02:57:27.798]  But I still was not able to go out into the sun.
[02:57:29.099 --> 02:57:31.000]  Last summer, this past summer,
[02:57:32.136 --> 02:57:34.357]  I've been taking your iodine now for about a year.
[02:57:35.378 --> 02:57:41.361]  I was outside, and I decided a couple summers ago I was going to stop wearing sunscreen and just wear long-sleeved shirts.
[02:57:41.661 --> 02:57:49.025]  But this past summer, I caught myself going outside and standing in the sun, and then one day it hit me.
[02:57:49.045 --> 02:57:49.505]  Well, whoa.
[02:57:49.685 --> 02:57:50.225]  Wait a minute.
[02:57:50.305 --> 02:57:52.186]  It's 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
[02:57:52.206 --> 02:57:53.907]  I don't have a shirt on.
[02:57:54.487 --> 02:57:56.648]  The sun's hitting me, and I'm not hurting.
[02:57:58.209 --> 02:57:58.929]  And then it hit me.
[02:57:59.770 --> 02:58:00.090]  Wow.
[02:58:01.151 --> 02:58:01.831]  The iodine.
[02:58:03.895 --> 02:58:17.292]  After all these years of not being able to be out in the sun, a crucial element that the body needs, I find out that, yeah, I would have been able to be out in the sun, even with this autoimmune disease, had they not taken away my iodine.
[02:58:17.332 --> 02:58:17.933]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:58:18.013 --> 02:58:19.515]  You will die without iodine.
[02:58:19.535 --> 02:58:21.837]  It's like you'll die without vitamin C, and they don't tell people that.
[02:58:22.589 --> 02:58:24.190]  And I can't make any medical claims.
[02:58:24.330 --> 02:58:30.972]  I know personally, Group 7, I'll be on this a few months, that my age spots, sun spots would probably go away, and that I would get healthier skin.
[02:58:30.992 --> 02:58:40.636]  And that's the biggest thing I noticed was hair grew faster, nails got thicker, and all this stuff came out of my skin, and now I suntan down to a coconut when I'm really out in the sun.
[02:58:40.656 --> 02:58:43.737]  I mean, I get a real rich tan now, like my dad always did.
[02:58:43.777 --> 02:58:44.698]  He's part Native American.
[02:58:45.038 --> 02:58:47.399]  And now I get a real rich tan instead of just burning.
[02:58:47.739 --> 02:58:50.280]  And Group said, yeah, your skin absolutely just...
[02:58:50.600 --> 02:58:52.361]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:58:52.381 --> 02:58:55.622]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[02:59:08.268 --> 02:59:11.090]  And optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:11.310 --> 02:59:13.171]  Just one of the key compounds.
[02:59:13.271 --> 02:59:16.333]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies.

[03:00:02.251 --> 03:00:04.841]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.398 --> 03:00:18.404]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:19.024 --> 03:00:22.047]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:22.588 --> 03:00:24.930]  All right, Gene, very interesting story about lupus.
[03:00:24.950 --> 03:00:27.012]  You know, all I know is lupus numbers are way up.
[03:00:27.132 --> 03:00:28.914]  All these autoimmune diseases are off the charts.
[03:00:28.954 --> 03:00:32.016]  The GMO, the vaccines, all of it's been linked to it.
[03:00:32.917 --> 03:00:38.962]  Really, the GMO, we know, gets into your cells, it's improving in major white papers, and it's causing serious, serious problems.
[03:00:40.263 --> 03:00:45.267]  But I can't sit here and say, oh, yes, I'm sure proper iodine, you know, help with your lupus.
[03:00:45.927 --> 03:00:58.617]  I just know that if you don't have some of the base nutrients in your body, you will get neurological disorders, you will get other disorders, you will... If you don't get any vitamin C, your teeth will all fall out and huge sores will pop up all over your body.
[03:00:59.710 --> 03:01:10.874]  I've talked to so many old people that have sores all over them, and if you get them, because they can't really absorb nutrients anymore out of vegetables as much, if you get them on different mineral powders, the sores just heal, like beyond tangy tangerine.
[03:01:11.995 --> 03:01:13.055]  But it's like that with cattle.
[03:01:14.356 --> 03:01:17.137]  If your cows don't get the right nutrients and minerals, they get sick.
[03:01:17.697 --> 03:01:21.678]  If you're feeding them on grass that's in played out soil, then you've got to give them mineral blocks.
[03:01:22.359 --> 03:01:25.500]  I mean, I worked for a large animal vet off and on for four years.
[03:01:26.499 --> 03:01:27.980]  That's all they talked about was minerals.
[03:01:28.660 --> 03:01:29.600]  And it's just well known.
[03:01:29.640 --> 03:01:30.941]  And then afterwards it's mumbo-jumbo.
[03:01:31.221 --> 03:01:32.662]  He claims you need minerals.
[03:01:33.122 --> 03:01:34.563]  He claims you need iodine.
[03:01:35.683 --> 03:01:37.744]  But it's just a fact.
[03:01:37.764 --> 03:01:46.388]  I mean, the Feds put it in the salt for 50-something years, the good halogen, and millions of people ended up getting rid of all these thyroid problems, all this goiter.
[03:01:47.269 --> 03:01:51.691]  They got it out in the 70s for whatever reason and put the bad halogen in the water, fluoride,
[03:01:53.029 --> 03:01:57.113]  But I don't want to rant about that because we've got other callers here and if I don't get to you, I'm sure Watson and Will are coming up.
[03:01:57.734 --> 03:01:58.594]  Let's talk to Gene.
[03:01:58.614 --> 03:02:00.216]  Gene, what was your point about upcoming revolution?
[03:02:01.477 --> 03:02:14.490]  Well, I applaud the efforts that you are making right now and everybody that is in on this and if we were in any other time in history, Alex, I think the people would win.
[03:02:15.066 --> 03:02:23.088]  But I agree with, um, I can't remember who you were talking about earlier, but he believes that we are in these times, the end.
[03:02:23.208 --> 03:02:26.868]  Probably talking about Joel Skousen just says the decadence and the evil.
[03:02:27.989 --> 03:02:29.669]  A lot of people don't like have a spirit now.
[03:02:29.689 --> 03:02:31.790]  I mean, I don't want to say they don't have a spirit, but it's like they're zombies.
[03:02:32.490 --> 03:02:35.510]  And they're just, they just, all they do is repeat, you know, Family Guy to you.
[03:02:36.070 --> 03:02:37.651]  And I'm not knocking folks to watch Family Guy.
[03:02:37.671 --> 03:02:39.671]  It's just, that's all they do is talk about the TV.
[03:02:39.851 --> 03:02:41.031]  Well, that's not the real world.
[03:02:41.932 --> 03:02:43.372]  And it's, it's very scary.
[03:02:45.295 --> 03:02:49.779]  And unfortunately, this is about the manifestation of pure evil.
[03:02:50.059 --> 03:02:57.406]  I honestly think that it's going to be put in front of us, each and every one of us, a mirror, so that we can see what we truly are.
[03:02:57.606 --> 03:03:08.796]  And although they are dividing us by race, by nationality, and all that, in the end, it's not going to matter what color you are, whether you're a man or a woman, what country you're from.
[03:03:09.116 --> 03:03:12.619]  What's going to matter is, are you going to respect your mother and father?
[03:03:13.163 --> 03:03:14.444]  Are you going to commit murder?
[03:03:14.644 --> 03:03:16.545]  Are you going to cheat on your husband and wife?
[03:03:16.626 --> 03:03:17.346]  Are you a thief?
[03:03:17.546 --> 03:03:20.808]  Are you going to lie to put somebody away?
[03:03:20.929 --> 03:03:22.910]  It comes down to are you honorable?
[03:03:23.350 --> 03:03:26.352]  Because I see people that get off on cheating other people and screwing them.
[03:03:26.973 --> 03:03:30.335]  I know folks that, you know, are really great people, but they still make jokes in business.
[03:03:30.375 --> 03:03:31.496]  Hey, you know, we beat that guy out.
[03:03:31.516 --> 03:03:32.136]  We got a better deal.
[03:03:32.457 --> 03:03:34.498]  I'm like, no, we're going to sell more of this product.
[03:03:34.838 --> 03:03:37.880]  They're going to make less per sale, but overall, we're going to be able to sell more.
[03:03:38.161 --> 03:03:38.841]  They're going to win.
[03:03:39.181 --> 03:03:42.784]  We just pressured them to give us a lower price so we can help them because they don't
[03:03:43.225 --> 03:03:48.058]  I don't even want to sit there and say in business I've hammered somebody, because I haven't.
[03:03:49.417 --> 03:03:52.578]  I mean, I just will not screw anybody over that doesn't have it coming to them.
[03:03:52.858 --> 03:03:54.179]  And then, I don't screw somebody over.
[03:03:54.539 --> 03:03:58.741]  I just pray, and I just do whatever's right, and every time, God comes to my aid.
[03:03:58.861 --> 03:04:00.761]  It's really, actually, very, very humbling.
[03:04:01.262 --> 03:04:07.484]  I have never prayed for something, and for intercession, and not have it happen, and it's very humbling.
[03:04:07.844 --> 03:04:08.344]  God bless you.
[03:04:08.364 --> 03:04:09.125]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:09.725 --> 03:04:10.145]  But it's weird.
[03:04:10.185 --> 03:04:13.026]  It's like, I almost know if God's going to answer my prayer.
[03:04:13.126 --> 03:04:17.448]  It's like, I'll think about praying for something, and I'll just go, no, I just shouldn't do that.
[03:04:18.570 --> 03:04:24.316]  I've only prayed to God to protect me a few dozen times, maybe, and it's just been dramatic what happens.
[03:04:27.078 --> 03:04:37.869]  But my prayer is just, God, if you want me to do this, I'm trying my best, I know I'm like dirty rags and this horrible creature, but you know I love good and I want to help people and I love you, and if you just help open these doors.
[03:04:38.209 --> 03:04:42.794]  If I'm supposed to be defeated by this, then that's your will, but I know you're real and I'm asking you to help me.
[03:04:43.374 --> 03:04:47.297]  And a lot of people are praying for me, and I know that you've got the greater plan there.
[03:04:47.337 --> 03:04:51.621]  So if it's your will that I be shut up or destroyed or whatever it is, then that's your will.
[03:04:51.641 --> 03:04:52.782]  But I just pray your will be done.
[03:04:52.842 --> 03:04:54.143]  And man, the doors just fly open.
[03:04:54.323 --> 03:04:54.543]  Boom.
[03:04:55.224 --> 03:05:03.671]  And it's scary, though, because when I say prayers against, well, not against, but to protect me from them, it's like dramatic.
[03:05:03.731 --> 03:05:05.172]  It takes a few days, and it's bad.
[03:05:06.193 --> 03:05:07.333]  And George Washington talked about it.
[03:05:08.033 --> 03:05:09.194]  He had that as well.
[03:05:09.794 --> 03:05:15.995]  Featured now at Infowars.com, for the first time ever, majority of Democrats now view socialism favorably.
[03:05:16.255 --> 03:05:26.757]  Doug Ross writes, the man currently running a distant second for the Democratic presidential nomination, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, is a self-declared socialist, and most of his party's voters now have a positive view of socialism.
[03:05:27.117 --> 03:05:35.619]  Socialism and the other offshoots of Marxism have failed in literally every venue it has been tried, despite progressive laughable efforts to claim certain countries have implemented it successfully.
[03:05:35.839 --> 03:05:38.621]  And let's look at the so-called success of European countries.
[03:05:38.941 --> 03:05:44.585]  Every one of them has rung up immense levels of unsustainable debt, thanks to the endless wealth redistribution schemes.
[03:05:44.945 --> 03:05:51.009]  Oh, and let's not forget, in the 20th century alone, communism led the way with the murders of 110 men, women, and children.
[03:05:51.269 --> 03:05:55.172]  But that's not stopping Bill Gates from saying, only socialism can save the planet.
[03:05:55.292 --> 03:05:55.712]  He added,
[03:06:06.159 --> 03:06:09.182]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:06:09.542 --> 03:06:15.007]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[03:06:15.287 --> 03:06:29.740]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:37.803]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[03:06:37.983 --> 03:06:43.445]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[03:06:43.565 --> 03:06:46.946]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[03:06:47.126 --> 03:06:51.107]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[03:06:51.248 --> 03:06:55.129]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[03:06:55.569 --> 03:06:59.595]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[03:07:12.552 --> 03:07:21.960]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[03:07:22.300 --> 03:07:24.842]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[03:07:25.003 --> 03:07:28.365]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[03:07:28.546 --> 03:07:34.571]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[03:07:34.871 --> 03:07:39.715]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[03:07:39.995 --> 03:07:46.178]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[03:07:46.378 --> 03:07:53.862]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[03:07:54.122 --> 03:08:01.406]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[03:08:11.519 --> 03:08:13.700]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:14.281 --> 03:08:17.183]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:20.525 --> 03:08:20.865]  We're back.
[03:08:21.145 --> 03:08:23.927]  It's the fourth hour live overdrive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:23.967 --> 03:08:26.069]  I'll be your host for the next hour, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:08:26.509 --> 03:08:29.251]  We're gonna take your calls in the second half of the hour at 800-259-9231.
[03:08:29.351 --> 03:08:31.312]  But first, I want to ask the question this hour.
[03:08:35.675 --> 03:08:41.421]  Will Angela Merkel be the first European leader to commit national suicide?
[03:08:41.862 --> 03:08:47.188]  I've got a raft of headlines up in front of me, probably 15 to 20 headlines, which we're going to run through quickly.
[03:08:47.829 --> 03:08:53.975]  But these are just over the past week regarding Germany, the situation with the migrants, of course.
[03:08:54.816 --> 03:09:01.261]  It was in the national headlines and international headlines for a period of about three, four weeks back in September.
[03:09:01.902 --> 03:09:05.465]  Now it's kind of disappeared from international headlines.
[03:09:05.525 --> 03:09:07.767]  Of course, it's still a big deal in Europe itself.
[03:09:08.587 --> 03:09:11.290]  But the situation is only escalating.
[03:09:11.750 --> 03:09:15.694]  Look at this headline out of Breitbart.com, and this isn't even the most shocking.
[03:09:16.675 --> 03:09:19.937]  Soros admits involvement in migrant crisis.
[03:09:20.438 --> 03:09:22.960]  National borders are the obstacle.
[03:09:23.581 --> 03:09:33.049]  And you may remember last week the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban came out and basically accused George Soros of being behind this migrant invasion, which he is.
[03:09:33.309 --> 03:09:34.550]  His foundations fund it.
[03:09:35.291 --> 03:09:43.768]  Orban said last week, quote, this invasion is driven on the one hand by people smugglers who we know are getting paid thousands of dollars to get some of these people in.
[03:09:44.761 --> 03:09:59.604]  And on the other hand, by those human rights activists who support everything that weakens the nation-state, this Western mindset and this activist network, speaking of George Soros, is best represented by George Soros.
[03:09:59.764 --> 03:10:02.924]  That's the Prime Minister of Hungary who said that last week.
[03:10:02.964 --> 03:10:04.425]  Of course, Hungary put up the wall.
[03:10:05.065 --> 03:10:10.506]  They kept the wave of migrants out after an initial influx that completely overwhelmed them.
[03:10:11.306 --> 03:10:21.331]  But Soros has now come back in an email statement to Bloomberg Business, claiming his foundation's help, quote, uphold European values.
[03:10:21.371 --> 03:10:22.771]  That's right, he actually said that.
[03:10:23.612 --> 03:10:29.954]  And this is what he said in direct response to Orban's claim that he was undermining European culture, European sovereignty.
[03:10:30.535 --> 03:10:37.458]  This is what Soros said, quote, his plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective
[03:10:38.158 --> 03:10:41.721]  And the refugees as an obstacle, Mr Soros said.
[03:10:42.562 --> 03:10:49.188]  Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle.
[03:10:49.568 --> 03:10:50.909]  Did you hear that correctly?
[03:10:51.490 --> 03:11:03.200]  Brazenly admitting, this is George Soros, brazenly admitting that he is supporting this migrant invasion to undermine national sovereignty and dissolve national borders.
[03:11:03.240 --> 03:11:04.541]  He just said it outright.
[03:11:05.302 --> 03:11:11.949]  And of course this is a guy who specializes in undermining and destabilizing democratic systems.
[03:11:12.009 --> 03:11:16.253]  We saw it in Ukraine with the overthrow of that elected government.
[03:11:16.774 --> 03:11:28.005]  We're seeing it in the United States with George Soros Foundations and their spin-offs funding the Black Lives Matter movement, which again is causing huge social tension in America.
[03:11:28.625 --> 03:11:28.826]  Again,
[03:11:29.486 --> 03:11:34.630]  Its inspiration is a convicted cop killer who's on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list.
[03:11:35.091 --> 03:11:37.453]  This is not a grassroots organization.
[03:11:37.513 --> 03:11:38.213]  It's top-down.
[03:11:38.574 --> 03:11:44.258]  It's being funded by these massive NGOs, some of whom are controlled, some of which are controlled by George Soros.
[03:11:44.579 --> 03:11:54.227]  And now he's doing the same in Germany, and he's brazenly admitted the fact that it's about undermining national sovereignty and dissolving national borders.
[03:11:55.225 --> 03:12:01.884]  No surprise then, last week, that these top German security experts, and we had this up on Infowars.com.
[03:12:02.907 --> 03:12:09.291]  Middle class becoming radicalized in backlash against migrant influx, warn German security experts.
[03:12:09.831 --> 03:12:25.100]  A letter obtained by German newspaper Die Welt, written by top security experts, warns that the middle class in Germany is becoming radicalized in response to the migrant influx, and that domestic unrest may occur as a result.
[03:12:25.500 --> 03:12:28.802]  Now we'll get to this later, but in Sweden, for example,
[03:12:29.702 --> 03:12:37.627]  Over a dozen of these migrant centers have already been set on fire because the people are just going mental over this rebelling.
[03:12:37.667 --> 03:12:38.968]  They don't know what to do anymore.
[03:12:39.429 --> 03:12:48.255]  And again, in Germany, now you have neo-Nazis attacking these migrants as they're being brought in, which is obviously horrible and no one condones that.
[03:12:48.835 --> 03:12:58.842]  But it goes back to the point that this insane policy, which Germany's own top security experts are warning could lead to civil unrest, people disobeying the law,
[03:12:59.742 --> 03:13:02.163]  ...is emboldening extremists on both sides.
[03:13:02.183 --> 03:13:08.885]  Of course we've had concerns about ISIS and other jihadists being embedded, as they openly said they would do, within this wave of migrants.
[03:13:09.345 --> 03:13:12.926]  Now we've got neo-Nazis in Germany attacking the migrants.
[03:13:13.506 --> 03:13:24.409]  And Angela Merkel's insane policy has succeeded in ensuring the re-emergence of neo-Nazis, who if this continues are going to be at the height of popularity.
[03:13:25.267 --> 03:13:40.508]  You know, the biggest height of popularity since the 1940s, simply because of the insanity of this policy, which now top German security experts are saying will lead to civil unrest, because they're being completely overwhelmed, as we'll get on to.
[03:13:41.423 --> 03:13:51.585]  In response, another headline out of Breitbart.com, hundreds of Germans are trying to bring treason charges against Angela Merkel over migration policy.
[03:13:52.245 --> 03:14:00.327]  Hundreds of Germans are attempting to bring criminal charges against Merkel, accusing her of treason by opening the borders of Germany to mass migration.
[03:14:00.727 --> 03:14:08.329]  The Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe has received over 400 letters calling to open an investigation into Merkel
[03:14:08.829 --> 03:14:09.329]  We're good.
[03:14:26.917 --> 03:14:34.102]  Anyone who attempts to effect change to the German Republic or damage the constitutional order by force or threat of force is guilty of high treason.
[03:14:34.462 --> 03:14:37.544]  And that's what they argue Merkel is now doing.
[03:14:37.784 --> 03:14:45.829]  Because the studies show, and this is out of the Gatestone Institute, Germany, 20 million Muslims by 2020.
[03:14:47.190 --> 03:14:50.092]  Now the normal tipping point for civil unrest
[03:14:50.936 --> 03:14:55.659]  With an incoming population that's not integrated into society, that's the key.
[03:14:55.879 --> 03:15:02.844]  Doesn't matter their skin color, doesn't matter their background, it's the fact that they're not integrated into the society in which they're entering.
[03:15:03.184 --> 03:15:08.348]  The tipping point is 6-7% on average when you start to see civil unrest.
[03:15:08.748 --> 03:15:12.370]  We've seen it in France over the past 5, 6, 7 years.
[03:15:12.811 --> 03:15:14.892]  They've got the highest Muslim population in Europe.
[03:15:14.912 --> 03:15:18.575]  We're now beginning to see it in Sweden because they're catching up.
[03:15:19.415 --> 03:15:27.958]  So now we're talking about 20 million Muslims in Germany, a country with a population of around 80 million, within the next five, six years.
[03:15:28.618 --> 03:15:38.062]  If the figures, if the wave of migrants continue at the current numbers, 10,000 of these migrants today are flooding into Germany from Austria.
[03:15:39.382 --> 03:15:40.823]  10,000 every single day.
[03:15:41.303 --> 03:15:43.484]  And now the Gatestone Institute is reporting
[03:15:44.344 --> 03:15:55.687]  Germany's Muslim population is set to nearly quadruple to an astonishing 20 million within the next five years according to a demographic forecast by Bavarian lawmakers.
[03:15:56.187 --> 03:16:05.950]  The German government expects to receive 1.5 million asylum seekers in 2015, that's just by the end of this year, and possibly even more in 2016.
[03:16:07.390 --> 03:16:20.775]  After factoring in family reunifications, based on the assumption that individuals whose asylum applications are approved will subsequently bring an average of four additional family members to Germany, that number will swell exponentially.
[03:16:21.295 --> 03:16:25.297]  This is in addition to the 5.8 million Muslims already living in Germany.
[03:16:26.155 --> 03:16:36.837]  So according to the President of the Bavarian Association of Municipalities, this is an official organisation, Germany is now on track to have 20 million Muslims by 2020.
[03:16:37.097 --> 03:16:48.119]  And again, as he says, it represents a demographic shift of epic proportions, one that will change the face of Germany forever.
[03:16:48.560 --> 03:16:55.541]  Because there's no integration plan, there's no language course, they're just housing these migrants in these camps
[03:16:56.929 --> 03:16:57.869]  Many of them are leaving.
[03:16:57.949 --> 03:16:59.630]  Thousands have left without trace.
[03:16:59.670 --> 03:17:01.111]  They've just gone into the underground.
[03:17:01.131 --> 03:17:02.331]  They don't even know where they are.
[03:17:02.851 --> 03:17:04.792]  Now they're running out of migrant centres.
[03:17:05.112 --> 03:17:06.853]  They're running out of gymnasiums.
[03:17:07.213 --> 03:17:12.375]  They're running out of disused office warehouses to keep these people in.
[03:17:12.655 --> 03:17:15.996]  And so now they're just going ahead and building houses for them.
[03:17:16.516 --> 03:17:18.936]  And we had that story up today on Infowars.com.
[03:17:19.457 --> 03:17:23.677]  Government to build 60 new houses for migrants while poor Germans are evicted.
[03:17:24.298 --> 03:17:29.019]  And this is in the German town of Bergheim, which has already accepted hundreds of migrants.
[03:17:29.059 --> 03:17:30.879]  They've run out of room, basically.
[03:17:31.199 --> 03:17:40.221]  So now the government is building 60 houses at a cost of 12 million euros to house an additional 600 migrants.
[03:17:40.241 --> 03:17:41.561]  These are going to be large houses.
[03:17:42.081 --> 03:17:45.722]  While, as the Telegraph reports, and you can check out the link in this article,
[03:17:46.622 --> 03:18:00.870]  Germans, German citizens living in apartments owned by local municipalities, but apartments on which they pay rent, so this isn't even social housing, they're actually paying rent for this, they're now getting eviction notices.
[03:18:01.590 --> 03:18:08.135]  Because they're going to be replaced by refugees, because they're taking so many in, there's just nowhere to house them.
[03:18:08.495 --> 03:18:17.823]  So now they're actually having to kick Germans out of their own homes, and build new homes, free homes for migrants, simply to cope with the influx.
[03:18:18.383 --> 03:18:25.689]  And then we had this Kurt Nimmo article up a couple of days ago, entitled Illegals, quote, when will I get my house and car?
[03:18:26.707 --> 03:18:32.992]  Illegal immigrants in Germany feel they are entitled to homes and cars, according to an article appearing in Dauker Rundschau.
[03:18:33.513 --> 03:18:38.737]  Quote, I realize that most of them will, with unrealistic ideas and expectations when they come here.
[03:18:39.058 --> 03:18:42.361]  They often ask me, when will I get my house and my car?
[03:18:43.482 --> 03:18:47.025]  Asylum coordinator Isabel Sitner told the newspaper.
[03:18:47.525 --> 03:18:50.027]  So, a free house is not enough for them.
[03:18:50.067 --> 03:19:02.376]  We've got migrants in the Netherlands complaining about the Wi-Fi connection not being good enough, about the food being average, about them not being able to afford to buy cigarettes because they're not being given enough free money.
[03:19:04.045 --> 03:19:06.869]  All the while, German citizens being kicked out of their homes.
[03:19:07.389 --> 03:19:08.451]  Then we had this story.
[03:19:09.152 --> 03:19:13.798]  Muslim migrants invited to take over German church, altar cross pulpit removed.
[03:19:14.398 --> 03:19:18.884]  Of course, we had the world's first lesbian feminist bishop.
[03:19:19.765 --> 03:19:28.273]  Over in Sweden, saying that their churches should remove all Christian symbols, remove crosses, so as not to offend Muslims.
[03:19:28.774 --> 03:19:37.342]  And now actually in Germany, they're doing the same thing, while inviting, in this case, 50 Muslim migrants to completely take over this church.
[03:19:37.382 --> 03:19:39.924]  It's not going to be used for Christian church services anymore.
[03:19:40.405 --> 03:19:42.246]  It's going to be used to house these migrants.
[03:19:42.927 --> 03:19:46.190]  Again, most of whom are Syrian.
[03:19:46.430 --> 03:19:48.572]  We've been sold this lie over and over again.
[03:19:48.952 --> 03:19:55.277]  If you actually look at the UN's own figures, only one-fifth of these migrants are actually Syrian.
[03:19:55.677 --> 03:20:02.663]  Most of them are economic refugees fleeing to Germany for a higher standard of living, and the taxpayers are going to pay for it.
[03:20:02.683 --> 03:20:07.166]  We'll be back after this break on the Alex Jones Show, fourth hour overdrive.
[03:20:07.186 --> 03:20:07.687]  Stay tuned.
[03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:14.161]  Do you lay awake at night and worry about the health and safety of you and your loved ones?
[03:20:14.381 --> 03:20:18.202]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[03:20:18.462 --> 03:20:23.563]  How can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens that are beginning to emerge in the world today?
[03:20:23.903 --> 03:20:27.024]  Give yourself peace of mind with Supernatural Silver.

[03:21:13.268 --> 03:21:14.168]  But where do you get it?

[03:21:46.098 --> 03:21:47.298]  Stainless steel construction.

[03:22:09.992 --> 03:22:12.994]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[03:22:13.314 --> 03:22:18.478]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[03:22:18.798 --> 03:22:20.700]  But they're about to lose control.
[03:22:21.080 --> 03:22:26.064]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[03:22:26.404 --> 03:22:30.847]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[03:22:30.967 --> 03:22:33.009]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[03:22:33.369 --> 03:22:36.872]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[03:22:37.213 --> 03:22:41.296]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[03:22:41.737 --> 03:22:47.262]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves, but this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[03:22:47.442 --> 03:22:48.843]  This will affect us all.
[03:22:49.304 --> 03:22:52.807]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[03:22:54.028 --> 03:23:00.275]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.

[03:23:06.522 --> 03:23:08.524]  Again, that's DollarDanger.com.
[03:23:12.352 --> 03:23:16.573]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[03:23:16.993 --> 03:23:20.733]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:23:21.274 --> 03:23:22.514]  We typically do the same thing.
[03:23:22.654 --> 03:23:25.194]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[03:23:25.694 --> 03:23:27.295]  But have you considered heat storage?
[03:23:27.895 --> 03:23:29.695]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[03:23:30.095 --> 03:23:31.775]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:23:32.395 --> 03:23:33.756]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:23:34.036 --> 03:23:36.476]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[03:23:36.516 --> 03:23:40.577]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[03:23:41.397 --> 03:23:42.118]  Another concern?
[03:23:42.518 --> 03:23:46.181]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[03:23:46.502 --> 03:23:48.764]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:23:49.084 --> 03:23:52.287]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:23:53.068 --> 03:23:55.510]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[03:23:55.870 --> 03:23:59.834]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[03:24:00.514 --> 03:24:01.855]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[03:24:02.536 --> 03:24:03.817]  FortressClothing.com.
[03:24:04.178 --> 03:24:05.519]  You'll never be cold again.
[03:24:27.594 --> 03:24:31.718]  We're back live at the Alex Jones Show, 4th Hour Overdrive, with me, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:24:32.179 --> 03:24:34.721]  Gonna go to your calls here in about 15 minutes time.
[03:24:35.362 --> 03:24:42.489]  But we're continuing to ask the question, will Angela Merkel be the first European leader to commit national suicide?
[03:24:42.749 --> 03:24:45.952]  This migrant issue is only escalating in Germany.
[03:24:46.352 --> 03:24:48.054]  The people are getting radicalised.
[03:24:48.174 --> 03:24:52.377]  That's not according to me, that's according to the top security experts in Germany.
[03:24:52.757 --> 03:25:06.686]  Because they see this wave of Muslim migrants who aren't integrated, who are bringing over all the worst aspects of their own culture, and there's simply no plan going forward to try and ease them into the German society.
[03:25:06.706 --> 03:25:10.389]  And now they're talking about 20 million Muslims
[03:25:11.169 --> 03:25:13.051]  Muslim migrants in Germany by 2020.
[03:25:14.433 --> 03:25:22.262]  And that tipping point is way above the 6-7% average, which brings social disorder as we've seen in other countries.
[03:25:22.722 --> 03:25:24.704]  Now we got this headline out of Gateway Pundit.
[03:25:25.555 --> 03:25:26.756]  And we're going to go to the video here.
[03:25:27.236 --> 03:25:29.598]  Caught on video, German Muslim.
[03:25:29.698 --> 03:25:40.267]  This is a German Muslim in Germany, basically jabbing his finger out and telling a German citizen, Islam is coming and your daughters will wear the hijab.
[03:25:40.387 --> 03:25:42.309]  And I'm going to commentate over this video.
[03:25:42.349 --> 03:25:43.170]  Let's go to the clip.
[03:25:45.998 --> 03:25:46.878]  The Islam is coming to take over the world.
[03:25:46.898 --> 03:25:47.758]  Your daughter will wear a headscarf.
[03:25:47.778 --> 03:25:48.299]  Your son will wear a beard.
[03:25:48.339 --> 03:25:49.199]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:25:49.219 --> 03:25:50.039]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:25:50.059 --> 03:25:50.919]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:25:50.939 --> 03:25:51.800]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:25:51.820 --> 03:25:52.740]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:25:52.760 --> 03:25:53.680]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:25:53.700 --> 03:25:54.740]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:25:54.760 --> 03:25:55.621]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:25:55.641 --> 03:25:56.781]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:25:56.841 --> 03:25:57.781]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:25:57.801 --> 03:25:58.661]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:25:58.681 --> 03:25:59.622]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:25:59.642 --> 03:26:01.042]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:26:01.062 --> 03:26:01.942]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:26:01.962 --> 03:26:02.903]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:26:02.923 --> 03:26:04.023]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:26:04.043 --> 03:26:04.923]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:26:04.943 --> 03:26:05.964]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:26:06.044 --> 03:26:07.624]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:26:07.644 --> 03:26:08.704]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:26:08.744 --> 03:26:09.785]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:26:09.825 --> 03:26:11.185]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:26:11.205 --> 03:26:12.885]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:26:12.905 --> 03:26:14.526]  Your daughter will marry a worthy husband.
[03:26:14.546 --> 03:26:15.026]  Your daughter will marry
[03:26:15.226 --> 03:26:21.009]  The German has taken advantage of the Muslim for too long just so he can drive his Mercedes.
[03:26:21.570 --> 03:26:25.032]  Now Islam is coming and your daughters will wear the hijab.
[03:26:25.692 --> 03:26:28.474]  I can see the look of hate in your eyes.
[03:26:28.974 --> 03:26:29.975]  And that's the end of the clip.
[03:26:30.735 --> 03:26:35.259]  What he's saying is true, and he's not the first one to say it.
[03:26:35.299 --> 03:26:38.321]  We had another article back a couple of months ago.
[03:26:38.781 --> 03:26:43.785]  Top imam, Muslim migrants should breed with Europeans to conquer their countries.
[03:26:43.845 --> 03:26:47.107]  That was his quote, to conquer their countries.
[03:26:47.628 --> 03:26:54.493]  This was a top imam in Jerusalem who said quote, throughout Europe all the hearts are enthused with hatred towards Muslims.
[03:26:54.753 --> 03:26:57.936]  They wish that we were dead, but they have lost their fertility.
[03:26:58.576 --> 03:27:00.757]  So they look for fertility in our mitts.
[03:27:01.417 --> 03:27:10.259]  And he basically went on to say that they're going to use this migrant invasion to conquer European countries and to breed out the host population.
[03:27:10.740 --> 03:27:13.320]  Again, not my words, their words.
[03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:15.901]  Now they're handing them churches.
[03:27:16.181 --> 03:27:18.882]  We had another article which is up on DrudgeReport.com.
[03:27:19.946 --> 03:27:24.510]  German schools abolish Christian festival to avoid offending Muslim migrants.
[03:27:25.291 --> 03:27:29.475]  Again, the German citizens have to integrate into their culture.
[03:27:29.555 --> 03:27:32.057]  They don't have to integrate into the German culture.
[03:27:32.097 --> 03:27:37.001]  That's how it works, because this is a program, as the top imam said, of conquest.
[03:27:37.882 --> 03:27:51.217]  Primary schools and kindergartens in Germany are abolishing the Christian celebration and changing it into a generic festival of lights so as not to offend the hundreds of thousands of Muslim migrants pouring into the country.
[03:27:51.958 --> 03:27:55.842]  And of course, I mentioned before, they're removing the Christian crosses, they're removing the altars.
[03:27:56.923 --> 03:28:02.407]  And what's interesting about this is that leftist politicians have been calling for this St.
[03:28:02.467 --> 03:28:09.491]  Martin's Festival to be changed for years, because they said that there's too many Muslim children in the schools, it might offend them.
[03:28:10.252 --> 03:28:26.523]  So this has been going on for years, they're trying to abolish this, they're trying to undermine the host culture, the Christian culture in Germany, and replace it with this wishy-washy festival of lights, completely meaningless, because again, they're trying to dilute the German culture,
[03:28:27.524 --> 03:28:35.989]  As I explained in one of my previous videos, because the tide is starting to turn against the EU, which of course runs straight out of Germany.
[03:28:36.030 --> 03:28:37.030]  That's the centre of it all.
[03:28:37.871 --> 03:28:41.633]  Country after country is rejecting the EU Federal Superstate.
[03:28:41.674 --> 03:28:44.756]  They're rejecting this centralisation of power.
[03:28:45.196 --> 03:28:55.924]  So they need to move in huge numbers of people, who of course will have children and become full citizens with voting rights, who will support big government, who will support the EU Superstate.
[03:28:56.584 --> 03:28:58.305]  There are also other agendas behind this.
[03:28:58.345 --> 03:29:10.693]  Of course, Julian Assange referred to one last week, where he said this was also about ensuring a brain drain from countries like Syria, which obviously they've targeted for regime change.
[03:29:11.053 --> 03:29:26.102]  So along with these huge waves of Muslim migrants, you also get actual skilled immigrants who would be welcome into any country, and that causes a brain drain from Syria, and of course precipitates the collapse of that country, which has been the agenda all along.
[03:29:26.542 --> 03:29:28.463]  So we're going to hit a few more stories after the break.
[03:29:28.523 --> 03:29:38.107]  Also going to go to your calls here on the Alex Jones Show 4th Hour Overdrive.

[03:33:08.653 --> 03:33:18.516]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:33:19.136 --> 03:33:22.117]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:34.494 --> 03:33:35.915]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:35.935 --> 03:33:37.235]  It's the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:33:37.835 --> 03:33:41.537]  Now, this was an absolutely shocking article out of the New York Times.
[03:33:41.597 --> 03:33:43.037]  This came out Saturday.
[03:33:43.537 --> 03:33:44.878]  Again on the migrant crisis.
[03:33:46.138 --> 03:33:47.219]  This is just amazing.
[03:33:47.759 --> 03:33:48.739]  German village of 102.
[03:33:50.936 --> 03:33:53.918]  That's a population of 102 Germans.
[03:33:54.578 --> 03:33:58.461]  Braces for 750 asylum seekers.
[03:33:58.901 --> 03:34:01.683]  This is the village of Sumter in Germany.
[03:34:02.203 --> 03:34:18.794]  And when the mayor of this village was first told by the local government that they would be taking in, initially it was 1,000 asylum seekers, into this village of just 102 people, it was so off the charts crazy, he thought it was a hoax.
[03:34:19.474 --> 03:34:21.275]  He didn't even believe that it was real.
[03:34:21.295 --> 03:34:22.415]  It is real!
[03:34:22.915 --> 03:34:28.557]  And now 750 of these migrants are about to arrive in a village of 102 people.
[03:34:28.997 --> 03:34:33.899]  But notice in this New York Times article, within about five or six paragraphs,
[03:34:34.699 --> 03:34:42.303]  They say, they portray people who are concerned about this, which will obviously completely change the makeup of their village forever.
[03:34:42.543 --> 03:34:46.345]  This village has probably had the same culture for hundreds and hundreds of years.
[03:34:46.865 --> 03:34:53.229]  Now 750 people who have no relation to that culture whatsoever are going to be hanging around the village.
[03:34:54.332 --> 03:34:59.293]  And listen to what the New York Times said about the people who were concerned about this, just concerned about this.
[03:35:00.194 --> 03:35:03.955]  They characterized them as extremists and Nazis.
[03:35:04.615 --> 03:35:12.757]  One of the first people they quote in this article is a Nazi who said, quote, it's bad for the people, but politically it's good for me.
[03:35:13.317 --> 03:35:14.918]  And again, it goes back to the point I made.
[03:35:15.868 --> 03:35:20.732]  This policy, this insane policy by Merkel, is emboldening Nazis.
[03:35:21.312 --> 03:35:29.239]  It's assuring the re-emergence of Neo-Nazism in Germany, which had largely been dormant for several decades.
[03:35:29.299 --> 03:35:33.783]  It was controlled completely by German intelligence as little as ten years ago.
[03:35:34.083 --> 03:35:37.886]  Now there's an actual resurgence of it, simply because of this policy.
[03:35:38.346 --> 03:35:41.028]  But within six, seven paragraphs, the New York Times
[03:35:41.829 --> 03:35:52.818]  Doesn't talk to the residents of the village, the moderates who are, you know, they have genuine concerns about the fact they're about to be swamped by 750 Muslim migrants.
[03:35:53.139 --> 03:35:55.521]  They go straight to the Neo-Nazi.
[03:35:56.021 --> 03:35:59.164]  Then they talk about how this is going to embolden extremists.
[03:35:59.744 --> 03:36:02.545]  Well yeah, that's because the policy's insane to begin with.
[03:36:03.086 --> 03:36:13.850]  It's not because it's extremist to think that allowing 750 people to flood into a village that's got a population of 102 Germans isn't going to be a problem.
[03:36:14.451 --> 03:36:18.973]  That's obviously a very reasonable concern to have, but no, not according to the New York Times.
[03:36:19.173 --> 03:36:23.335]  You're a Nazi and you're an extremist if you have an issue with that.
[03:36:23.835 --> 03:36:25.196]  But I guess a lot of Americans
[03:36:25.976 --> 03:36:38.381]  Wouldn't have an issue with it either, judging by what beachgoers in San Diego said to Mark Dice about a Hillary Clinton plan to impose Sharia law in America.
[03:36:38.421 --> 03:36:39.441]  Let's go to that clip.
[03:36:40.422 --> 03:36:49.205]  One of Hillary's primary campaign promises is to help expand the Sharia law program in minority communities in America.
[03:36:49.785 --> 03:36:53.707]  You think that's the right campaign platform to be running on?
[03:36:55.819 --> 03:36:57.100]  Sharia law expansion?
[03:36:57.140 --> 03:36:57.440]  Yes!
[03:36:57.880 --> 03:36:58.620]  I'd say yes.
[03:36:58.720 --> 03:37:01.782]  To change the way women are treated in America?
[03:37:01.842 --> 03:37:02.482]  Absolutely.
[03:37:02.582 --> 03:37:04.263]  By implementing Sharia law?
[03:37:04.463 --> 03:37:04.984]  Absolutely.
[03:37:05.104 --> 03:37:06.184]  Hillary knows what's best?
[03:37:06.204 --> 03:37:06.885]  Hillary's cool.
[03:37:07.345 --> 03:37:07.605]  Okay.
[03:37:07.825 --> 03:37:08.505]  I'm going for it.
[03:37:08.525 --> 03:37:09.606]  I like your tattoo.
[03:37:09.706 --> 03:37:10.106]  Thank you.
[03:37:10.286 --> 03:37:10.586]  Thank you.
[03:37:10.626 --> 03:37:11.107]  Appreciate it.
[03:37:11.127 --> 03:37:14.528]  Do you think Hillary's plan for the Sharia law is the right thing?
[03:37:14.588 --> 03:37:16.709]  Is it the right time for that in America?
[03:37:16.729 --> 03:37:17.950]  I don't know.
[03:37:17.970 --> 03:37:19.271]  I don't think it'd be a bad thing.
[03:37:19.291 --> 03:37:22.092]  It can't be a bad thing, her Sharia law plan.
[03:37:22.272 --> 03:37:22.872]  Okay, thanks.
[03:37:22.953 --> 03:37:23.633]  Okay, thank you.
[03:37:24.833 --> 03:37:30.436]  One of Hillary Clinton's primary platforms is to spread Sharia law within the minority communities.
[03:37:31.156 --> 03:37:34.558]  Do you think that's the right thing to do in the New World Order?
[03:37:35.499 --> 03:37:36.099]  I guess so.
[03:37:36.119 --> 03:37:37.540]  Yeah.
[03:37:38.020 --> 03:37:41.922]  Would you support Hillary Clinton's Sharia law program?
[03:37:41.942 --> 03:37:43.943]  Do you think that's the right thing for the New World Order?
[03:37:47.003 --> 03:37:48.244]  Okay, good checking, thank you.
[03:37:48.804 --> 03:37:54.009]  Hillary Clinton, obviously running for president, could potentially be the first female president in the United States.
[03:37:54.629 --> 03:38:00.113]  Part of her campaign promises to implement the Sharia law program in the minority communities and in the middle class.
[03:38:00.133 --> 03:38:01.895]  Do you think she's on the right track?
[03:38:04.297 --> 03:38:04.657]  Sure.
[03:38:04.837 --> 03:38:07.039]  Are you going to be voting for Hillary?
[03:38:07.399 --> 03:38:07.779]  Sure.
[03:38:08.360 --> 03:38:15.165]  Do you think that's the right way to take America forward, is to implement Hillary Clinton's Sharia law expansion?
[03:38:15.185 --> 03:38:15.906]  Yeah, I do.
[03:38:16.903 --> 03:38:26.727]  Okay, that's Mark Dice from San Diego, talking to would-be Hillary Clinton supporters, and they advocate the imposition of Sharia law in America.
[03:38:27.087 --> 03:38:42.554]  Of course, they don't know what Sharia law is, they have absolutely no idea whatsoever, but it just shows if you go up to someone with confidence, nod your head, and propose virtually anything to them, and act as an authority figure, they will go right along with it.
[03:38:43.345 --> 03:38:48.932]  And I'll give you an example of what Sharia law might look like with its complete disrespect for women.
[03:38:49.613 --> 03:38:50.634]  We go to Norway.
[03:38:50.754 --> 03:38:54.980]  Again, Scandinavia is plagued by this rape scandal.
[03:38:55.000 --> 03:38:56.041]  We've seen it in Sweden.
[03:38:56.201 --> 03:38:57.503]  We've seen it in Denmark.
[03:38:58.144 --> 03:38:59.545]  Now this story out of Norway.
[03:39:00.546 --> 03:39:03.729]  Immigrants brutally gang-rape 14-year-old girl.
[03:39:04.050 --> 03:39:06.412]  One gets off with community service.
[03:39:06.773 --> 03:39:13.200]  Three African immigrants who brutally raped a 14-year-old girl to the point where she wanted to kill herself.
[03:39:14.226 --> 03:39:22.190]  Were given extremely light sentences by a court in Norway with one receiving community service and avoiding prison altogether.
[03:39:22.550 --> 03:39:34.036]  So they basically got this poor girl, accosted her on train near Oslo, then took her to a farmhouse, then took her to an apartment in Oslo, brutally gang raped her.
[03:39:34.756 --> 03:39:38.558]  One of them got 15 months, the other got 10 months in prison.
[03:39:39.218 --> 03:39:46.543]  They're going to be back out on the street in a year, raping other 14 year olds, and one of them didn't even get any prison time whatsoever.
[03:39:47.123 --> 03:39:52.187]  So again, we've got this huge rape epidemic sweeping Scandinavia.
[03:39:52.427 --> 03:40:03.815]  The feminists will say absolutely nothing about it because it's not politically correct to do so, while they make up a completely fake college rape crisis that doesn't exist.
[03:40:04.275 --> 03:40:07.999]  All the statistics show, whereas this one is actually happening.
[03:40:08.019 --> 03:40:14.184]  1400% increase in rapes in Sweden since they opened the doors to mass immigration.
[03:40:14.585 --> 03:40:21.971]  Because again, they're importing a ton of people who have no respect for women's rights and no respect for women altogether.
[03:40:22.832 --> 03:40:26.876]  The majority of cases in Sweden and almost half in Norway
[03:40:27.950 --> 03:40:30.292]  The culprits are always Muslim immigrants.
[03:40:30.332 --> 03:40:34.755]  You can drill down into the facts and see that, and we've done articles and videos on that.
[03:40:35.235 --> 03:40:45.423]  But even to make that point, people in these Scandinavian countries have been brought up on charges of hate crime simply for drawing attention to those statistics.
[03:40:45.803 --> 03:40:48.365]  So that is what Sharia law looks like.
[03:40:48.846 --> 03:40:54.190]  And judging by Mark Dice's videos, a lot of the ignorant Hillary Clinton supporters
[03:40:54.830 --> 03:40:59.113]  Would go right along with it, because they basically go along with anything she says.
[03:40:59.594 --> 03:41:01.055]  Let's go to some of these calls now.
[03:41:01.656 --> 03:41:03.977]  Let's go to Dion in Illinois.
[03:41:04.017 --> 03:41:05.839]  He wants to talk about refugees.
[03:41:05.879 --> 03:41:06.519]  Go ahead, Dion.
[03:41:07.580 --> 03:41:17.708]  Yeah, I'm just wondering, Paul, if there's any differences between the migration crisis in Europe and the burial bullets with the political exiles from Cuba?
[03:41:18.349 --> 03:41:19.470]  And do you think that
[03:41:20.414 --> 03:41:29.723]  Most homes are being manipulated like the native tribes were manipulated in the French-Indian War between the French, the English and the Americans.
[03:41:29.743 --> 03:41:33.727]  Well, I don't know if there's any connection to that.
[03:41:34.288 --> 03:41:40.834]  What I do know from my own perspective is, and thanks to the call, in the UK we've got 322,000 net immigration per year!
[03:41:44.568 --> 03:41:55.262]  This is a tiny island nation with a population of just above 60 million people and yet we're bringing in 322,000 new immigrants and that's just net per year.
[03:41:56.403 --> 03:42:02.070]  So they announced basically the Conservative government that they would bring in 20,000 Syrian refugees over the next...
[03:42:03.058 --> 03:42:04.159]  Five, six years.
[03:42:04.199 --> 03:42:10.084]  Which, of course, if you take that into the larger influx of 322,000, it's basically nothing.
[03:42:10.504 --> 03:42:21.754]  Because at least one government understands that, you know, you can't completely flood a country with a wave of people who are not integrated with no plan to integrate them whatsoever.
[03:42:22.354 --> 03:42:24.996]  And we've got reports which we've featured out of Germany
[03:42:25.854 --> 03:42:36.522]  Where again, it's not just Germans who are being targeted for rape by these migrants, it's other Muslim migrants, women and children, within the camps, both inside and outside.
[03:42:37.002 --> 03:42:40.545]  And those reports are being censored by the German media.
[03:42:40.885 --> 03:42:49.812]  In fact, the German police are not releasing the full details of those incidents because they, quote, don't want to legitimize critics of mass immigration.
[03:42:50.112 --> 03:42:53.615]  So it's not about protecting the victims, it's not about telling the truth.
[03:42:54.395 --> 03:42:56.080]  About what they're bringing into the country.
[03:42:56.361 --> 03:42:59.711]  It's about not legitimizing the people who might have a problem.
[03:43:00.632 --> 03:43:04.814]  With rapes going up 1400% as happened in Sweden.
[03:43:05.194 --> 03:43:18.740]  And of course now, Facebook with Zuckerberg and Merkel, they got together and hatched a little plan with the ex-Stasi informant to punish people who make anti-migrant posts on Facebook.
[03:43:19.080 --> 03:43:26.524]  And of course the examples they're going to use are people who, you know, call for them to be killed and the people who call for migrant centres to be burned to the ground.
[03:43:27.403 --> 03:43:39.850]  But they're also going to factor in legitimate criticism, as we saw with the police in Germany, saying that they're not going to report the details of these rape cases, so as not to legitimize critics of mass immigration.
[03:43:40.210 --> 03:43:51.216]  So, front to back, it continues to escalate, even though it's not being featured in the mainstream media, in international news headlines, really since last month, or even back in September.
[03:43:51.536 --> 03:43:53.798]  But now these wave of migrants are coming in,
[03:43:54.398 --> 03:43:56.319]  The Germans are beginning to rise up.
[03:43:56.739 --> 03:43:59.000]  The polls are shifting against Merkel.
[03:43:59.700 --> 03:44:03.042]  You know, initially it was, you know, yay, refugees welcome!
[03:44:03.062 --> 03:44:07.164]  And it was all these liberals out in train stations applauding, and that's all you saw on the media.
[03:44:07.784 --> 03:44:10.625]  Because they didn't want to show the people being robbed.
[03:44:10.705 --> 03:44:17.108]  They didn't want to show the rape statistics, because that's going to turn the population against it, because it's a legitimate concern.
[03:44:17.648 --> 03:44:22.631]  In fact, a video that I made last month, which simply included footage
[03:44:23.371 --> 03:44:29.259]  Of these migrants robbing people, throwing stones at people, you know, chanting Allah Akbar.
[03:44:30.260 --> 03:44:35.126]  That went up on Facebook and YouTube and got a combined total of about 8 million views.
[03:44:35.206 --> 03:44:36.188]  Just one video.
[03:44:36.588 --> 03:44:39.572]  Which shows you how starved people are for the truth about this.
[03:44:40.453 --> 03:44:42.615]  Because the media hasn't been objective.
[03:44:43.155 --> 03:44:51.481]  And as you saw with the New York Times article I covered earlier, they just simply call anyone who's got any concerns about this a Nazi or an extremist and that's it.
[03:44:51.941 --> 03:44:56.685]  Even though there are millions and millions of Germans who are legitimately concerned about this.
[03:44:57.205 --> 03:45:08.814]  So it continues to be a major issue and if they don't reverse this policy in Germany, God knows what's going to happen because the top security experts are saying there's going to be mass civil unrest.
[03:45:09.744 --> 03:45:17.157]  French security experts already said that before the height of this migrant crisis, that these radicalised communities...
[03:45:18.120 --> 03:45:22.081]  You know, in which we've seen riots back in 2005 and in the years after.
[03:45:22.362 --> 03:45:27.223]  They're going to be armed by actual jihadists and they're going to go to war with the police.
[03:45:27.783 --> 03:45:31.605]  Again, that's not me saying that, that's top security experts in France.
[03:45:32.205 --> 03:45:37.267]  Now German security experts are saying that the same thing could happen in Germany.
[03:45:37.287 --> 03:45:39.988]  We're going to switch gears now though to some other news.
[03:45:41.132 --> 03:45:42.935]  Again, this Russian airliner that went down.
[03:45:43.636 --> 03:45:49.444]  Russian plane disintegrated due to mechanical impact, airline claims, hinting at bomb explosion.
[03:45:50.065 --> 03:45:53.189]  So, of course, at first they suggested it was a technical fault.
[03:45:53.991 --> 03:45:57.055]  Then ISIS came out and said that they had shot it down.
[03:45:57.896 --> 03:46:01.980]  It was flying at 31,000 feet, so that seemed unlikely.
[03:46:02.381 --> 03:46:06.405]  Now they're saying that it could have been a bomb explosion on the plane itself.
[03:46:06.785 --> 03:46:13.312]  Of course, it's going to be somewhat of a propaganda defeat for Russia to admit that jihadists shot down their plane.
[03:46:13.332 --> 03:46:16.074]  Of course, after they've been bombarding ISIS,
[03:46:16.775 --> 03:46:27.323]  For the past six weeks or so, but now we have this article out of Gateway Pundit, breaking ISIS Sinai branch to release details of Russian jet crash with Baghdadi statement.
[03:46:27.883 --> 03:46:33.548]  So basically, they released the video of this plane going down a couple of days ago, you probably saw it.
[03:46:34.008 --> 03:46:36.088]  Nobody really knew if it was the actual plane.
[03:46:36.109 --> 03:46:43.890]  It seems unlikely that it was, because we know the debris was scattered over a wide area, suggesting that it exploded in mid-air.
[03:46:44.430 --> 03:46:51.292]  This video shows the plane pretty much in one piece going down, so it's probably unlikely that this is actual footage of the plane.
[03:46:51.852 --> 03:47:00.194]  But now apparently ISIS is going to release a detailed audio statement about the crash, including comments from ISIS leader al-Baghdadi.
[03:47:01.252 --> 03:47:05.436]  So they're still claiming responsibility for bringing down this airliner.
[03:47:05.937 --> 03:47:10.801]  Of course, all along Russia has said that it wasn't a terrorist attack.
[03:47:10.841 --> 03:47:12.663]  It looks like they're sticking by that story.
[03:47:12.903 --> 03:47:18.188]  But then other experts have now come out and said that it looks like there could have been a bomb on the plane.
[03:47:19.167 --> 03:47:21.908]  So, several different angles to this.
[03:47:21.988 --> 03:47:24.250]  It could take two, three months to find out the truth.
[03:47:24.990 --> 03:47:47.702]  What is interesting to recall, and we can play this clip, it's just about 30 seconds long of McCain, is that four or five weeks ago McCain came out in an interview with Fox News' Neil Cavuto and basically said that we should arm these jihadists in Syria, which we've been doing for years now, to shoot down Russian fighter jets, he specified fighter jets,
[03:47:48.427 --> 03:47:55.109]  But again, he said, give them weapons, give them anti-aircraft missiles to shoot down Russian planes.
[03:47:55.189 --> 03:47:55.969]  Here's that clip.
[03:47:56.809 --> 03:48:00.510]  They're attacking the very guys who we want to see topple aside.
[03:48:02.070 --> 03:48:06.331]  You would let American planes just pass them and let them do that?
[03:48:07.031 --> 03:48:13.053]  No, but I might do what we did in Afghanistan many years ago to give those guys the ability to shoot down those planes.
[03:48:13.513 --> 03:48:15.553]  That equipment is available.
[03:48:16.914 --> 03:48:17.954]  Who would be shooting them down?
[03:48:18.792 --> 03:48:23.218]  There's John McCain on Fox News basically saying we should arm the Syrian Jihadists.
[03:48:35.334 --> 03:48:36.695]  To shoot down Russian planes.
[03:48:36.755 --> 03:48:39.836]  Lo and behold, a Russian airliner shot down a few days ago.
[03:48:40.136 --> 03:48:48.280]  Of course, it looks like that this could have been a bomb on board because the plane was at 31,000 feet, which is basically impossible to reach with a missile fired from the ground.
[03:48:49.041 --> 03:49:04.008]  But several airlines have now said that they're not going to fly over that region because of the risk of being shot down by jihadists, which is the very policy that Senator John McCain advocated just a few weeks ago.
[03:49:04.668 --> 03:49:06.550]  Judy in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:49:06.570 --> 03:49:07.310]  Go ahead, Judy.
[03:49:07.330 --> 03:49:09.652]  Hi, Paul.
[03:49:09.692 --> 03:49:10.673]  Nice to speak with you.
[03:49:10.693 --> 03:49:14.056]  There's two things.
[03:49:14.236 --> 03:49:18.280]  One is Kent Hovind, who was just released from prison in July.
[03:49:18.660 --> 03:49:29.069]  He's expressed a couple of times an interest in coming on the show, and I know you and Alex probably know exactly who he is, but my question or statement is about
[03:49:29.602 --> 03:49:53.006]  Christians in general, how it seems as though they are, you know, just ready for the rapture at this point, and I think a lot of them don't have an understanding of, you know, exactly what's, you know, coming across the border already, and what is going to be entailed, and what's going to, you know, happen if there is a complete financial collapse.
[03:49:53.326 --> 03:49:55.766]  And I think they're enjoying their freedom very much.
[03:49:55.786 --> 03:49:58.807]  I mean, I know what's left of my freedom I'm still enjoying.
[03:49:59.677 --> 03:50:08.741]  As a Christian, but it's like, maybe it needs to be part of the national conversation as to how Christians should be viewing this day and age.
[03:50:09.141 --> 03:50:19.465]  You know, it's quite possible we're in end times, but if not, we could be just experiencing another really ugly regime with nuclear weapons.
[03:50:19.965 --> 03:50:21.866]  So I wanted to get your thoughts on it.
[03:50:21.906 --> 03:50:26.048]  It's really nice talking to you, and you know, what do you think?
[03:50:27.264 --> 03:50:32.027]  Well, I mean, you know, people thought it was the end times during Nazi Germany.
[03:50:32.107 --> 03:50:34.568]  That, you know, they thought it was the end times during the First World War.
[03:50:34.608 --> 03:50:38.030]  So, the only guarantee is that things are going to get a lot more crazy.
[03:50:38.050 --> 03:50:44.054]  What we know for sure, as Viktor Orban, the Hungarian Prime Minister, has said, is that this Muslim migrant invasion
[03:50:44.614 --> 03:50:51.917]  And it's not the fault of the people seeking a better life, it's the fault of the political leaders that have allowed it, is about undermining Christianity.
[03:50:51.997 --> 03:50:55.739]  And those political leaders are supposedly Christians themselves.
[03:50:56.259 --> 03:51:07.164]  So again, this is about power, this is about domination, this is about the EU federal super state, and that is, you know, diametrically opposed to the Christian foundation of Germany and these other European countries.
[03:51:07.204 --> 03:51:09.065]  We'll be right back, Alex Jones Show live.
[03:51:09.345 --> 03:51:09.826]  Stay tuned.
[03:51:10.766 --> 03:51:18.789]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:19.470 --> 03:51:20.190]  What did I do?
[03:51:20.950 --> 03:51:28.273]  I created ExtendoVite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.

[03:55:03.531 --> 03:55:05.153]  Final couple of news stories here.
[03:55:06.218 --> 03:55:20.290]  Of course, three weeks ago, top feminists Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn went in front of the United Nations and called for internet censorship of people who criticize them on the internet.
[03:55:20.670 --> 03:55:29.718]  They literally said that if you say feminists suck, or if you call them liars, that you should be cut off from the internet by your ISP.
[03:55:30.059 --> 03:55:31.220]  I made a video about this.
[03:55:31.880 --> 03:55:38.365]  They said this in front of the United Nations, who are supporting them in this web censorship program.
[03:55:38.686 --> 03:55:42.029]  So then we have this article out of Vice.com.
[03:55:42.509 --> 03:55:42.929]  Report.
[03:55:43.530 --> 03:55:49.775]  UN staff transported 380 pounds of weed, watched and shared child porn.
[03:55:50.396 --> 03:55:59.103]  Staff at the United Nations downloaded and shared child porn, transported roughly 380 pounds of weed in an official vehicle, and repeatedly threatened each other with murder.
[03:56:00.006 --> 03:56:13.619]  So you've got the United Nations aligning with top feminists, and thankfully the program has been shut down for now because it was so ridiculous and full of holes, calling for people to be censored on the internet if they disagree with feminists.
[03:56:14.864 --> 03:56:20.589]  While people at the United Nations were on their computers looking at child porn.
[03:56:20.989 --> 03:56:25.893]  But you need to be censored for telling a feminist that she's a liar.
[03:56:26.353 --> 03:56:28.215]  That's the most important thing.
[03:56:28.755 --> 03:56:30.957]  Again, completely ludicrous.
[03:56:31.537 --> 03:56:35.561]  And these UN officials have been caught in a myriad of scandals in the past.
[03:56:36.181 --> 03:56:45.991]  You know, child sex exploitation being prime amongst them, now embroiled in another scandal while lecturing everybody else about what they do on the internet.
[03:56:46.531 --> 03:56:52.257]  Merely criticising feminists, saying that that's bad, that's evil, you have to be censored, while watching child porn.
[03:56:52.758 --> 03:56:54.980]  Those are the kind of people who work at the United Nations.
[03:56:55.701 --> 03:56:56.542]  Another story here.
[03:56:57.571 --> 03:57:04.054]  Political strategist Roger Stone tells Sean and Larry King, Hillary Clinton is an abuser of women and girls.
[03:57:04.094 --> 03:57:05.674]  This is a big story just emerging.
[03:57:06.755 --> 03:57:11.937]  He said, quote, the narrative of Hillary Clinton's campaign that she's being an advocate for women and girls is just bogus.
[03:57:11.957 --> 03:57:14.498]  She is in fact an abuser of women and girls.
[03:57:14.898 --> 03:57:19.520]  Bill is a sexual predator, very much like Bill Cosby.
[03:57:19.820 --> 03:57:24.062]  I tracked 27 women that he has either assaulted or raped.
[03:57:24.602 --> 03:57:26.706]  Now this isn't just some kook on the internet.
[03:57:27.106 --> 03:57:28.188]  This is Roger Stone.
[03:57:28.749 --> 03:57:31.173]  He's a controversial figure, no doubt.
[03:57:31.834 --> 03:57:33.476]  But he's a political insider.
[03:57:33.657 --> 03:57:36.521]  He's coming out and saying that Hillary Clinton, who is, of course,
[03:57:37.691 --> 03:57:41.432]  Most of her platform is about this, quote, war on women that doesn't exist.
[03:57:41.792 --> 03:57:44.693]  She's priming herself as a feminist for 2016.
[03:57:45.833 --> 03:57:52.515]  Now he's coming out and saying that not only has Bill abused women and been a sexual predator, but Hillary has too.
[03:57:52.975 --> 03:57:55.556]  So it's going to be interesting what emerges in the aftermath of this.
[03:57:56.176 --> 03:58:00.938]  And again, Larry King was basically saying that if these allegations can be proven,
[03:58:01.738 --> 03:58:18.403]  This political operative, Roger Stone, is going to be targeted by the Clinton machine because we know they've tried to sink people in the past who have got dirt on them and many people accuse them of actually murdering people who had dirt on them.
[03:58:18.843 --> 03:58:20.643]  So that's going to be a big story breaking.
[03:58:20.663 --> 03:58:24.004]  We're going to have more on that at infowars.com.
[03:58:24.024 --> 03:58:25.825]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour
[03:58:26.565 --> 03:58:32.930]  Of the Alex Jones Show Live, of course, we'll be back tomorrow, 11 to 2, and be sure to tune in for the InfoWars Nightly News.
