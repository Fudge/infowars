[00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.323]  Martin Armstrong began his studies into market behavior.
[00:00:14.043 --> 00:00:15.885]  Armstrong's work has become world-renowned.
[00:00:16.325 --> 00:00:36.122]  The model has successfully pinpointed not merely major specific days when events will be in advance, but it has provided one of the most consistent guides for understanding the turning points in the global economy and thus the business cycle, not merely within a domestic economy, but within the global economy on the collective basis.

[00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:43.286]  In 85, forming the G5, the dollar was up dramatically at that point.
[00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:46.768]  The Deutsche Mark was like 4 to the dollar.
[00:00:48.088 --> 00:00:55.352]  And they basically just stood up and said, OK, fine, we're going to, you know, we want to see the dollar 40 percent lower.
[00:00:56.292 --> 00:00:58.093]  And that was the 87 crash.
[00:00:58.913 --> 00:01:04.476]  And because I went public and warned them they were going to create this crash if they do this,
[00:01:05.154 --> 00:01:06.374]  I mean, a common sense.
[00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:11.016]  You sold the Japanese, you know, everything from Rockefeller Center on down.
[00:01:11.956 --> 00:01:13.777]  And they own like more than a third of the U.S.
[00:01:13.837 --> 00:01:14.497]  national debt.
[00:01:14.677 --> 00:01:17.598]  Now you stand up and you say you're going to devalue it by 40 percent?
[00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.779]  Don't you think they would sell?
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.061]  There's no rational discussion with these people.
[00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:26.782]  And so they just started selling and that was your 87 crash.
[00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:35.030]  Let's talk about the secret meeting in London to end cash, and along with that now is this huge push in the media to get rid of cash.
[00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:43.454]  That's a bold move, but again, let's talk about why they would want to do that, A, but then B, about the secret meeting.
[00:01:44.194 --> 00:01:46.776]  Well, that's how they pulled this off.
[00:01:47.196 --> 00:01:57.181]  The media is part of the tool, and it was Larry Summers who first came out and said, gee, interest rates should go negative.
[00:01:58.078 --> 00:02:02.140]  Now, he wasn't in the administration, he was just at Harvard.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.584]  So what happens is, if the market rejects it, they can say, oh, that's just him talking.
[00:02:09.545 --> 00:02:13.007]  If it accepts it, alright, they're right behind it.
[00:02:13.387 --> 00:02:16.028]  So this is how politics really works.
[00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.092]  So what you're seeing right now is the media coming out, yeah, yeah, yeah, we should get rid of cash.
[00:02:24.537 --> 00:02:25.978]  That is the balloon.
[00:02:25.998 --> 00:02:27.158]  They're floating.
[00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.879]  Yes.
[00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:38.904]  The reason I've been pretty much so vocal, coming from the professional side, liquidity is absolutely evaporating.
[00:02:39.645 --> 00:02:50.670]  And it is scary, because that means when this thing turns down after October, and government bonds, etc., you're going to see a massive collapse.
[00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:51.291]  Massive.
[00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:53.992]  When this thing turns down after October,
[00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:56.592]  And government bonds, etc.
[00:02:56.652 --> 00:03:01.295]  You're going to see a massive, I mean, collapse, massive, because there's no bid.
[00:03:02.196 --> 00:03:06.519]  And it's really capital is scared to death everywhere.
[00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.662]  And they've been selling the longer term paper, 10 year bonds, etc.
[00:03:11.702 --> 00:03:12.563]  The bonds have crashed.
[00:03:13.003 --> 00:03:17.746]  And they're moving everything into like 30 day to six month paper max.
[00:03:18.927 --> 00:03:21.709]  And because nobody knows what's going on.
[00:03:34.048 --> 00:03:35.889]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:38.110]  Now today we got in our brand new t-shirts.
[00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.331]  This is the Save America t-shirt with the upside down flag.
[00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:45.513]  Now at InfoWars.com, in no way are we being disrespectful.
[00:03:45.553 --> 00:03:51.996]  In fact, this t-shirt was designed to help inform you and the people around you that will be seeing this t-shirt.
[00:03:52.276 --> 00:04:04.128]  Because, at the very bottom, we show you the actual United States flag code, Title IV, Chapter 1, which states that you should never fly the flag with the Union side down unless you're in a dire state of emergency.
[00:04:04.468 --> 00:04:12.916]  Now, if you haven't taken a look outside the door or turned on the news in the last year or so, then you would understand that our country, our republic, is in dire need of help.
[00:04:13.276 --> 00:04:16.299]  We have a government that continuously spies on us illegally.
[00:04:17.082 --> 00:04:27.336]  We have a country that continuously mistreats our veterans and then sends them to stupid, pointless, mindless wars with no truth base behind it whatsoever.
[00:04:27.616 --> 00:04:30.320]  And then they come home and they treat them like crap.
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.621]  They throw them on death panels.
[00:04:32.302 --> 00:04:33.523]  I myself am a veteran.
[00:04:33.843 --> 00:04:37.987]  I've served numerous tours, and I do not find this disrespectful whatsoever.
[00:04:38.267 --> 00:04:41.129]  And at InfoWars.com, we're here to inform you.
[00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:46.854]  So I want to encourage you, the viewer, to go to the InfoWars store and pick up your Save America T-shirt.
[00:04:47.274 --> 00:04:48.355]  Save the Republic.
[00:04:48.815 --> 00:04:49.776]  That's what it's all about.
[00:04:50.076 --> 00:04:50.937]  Saving the Republic.
[00:04:51.277 --> 00:04:55.381]  And this will be a really good conversation starter when you wear this out and go into public.
[00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:56.822]  You can help inform people.
[00:04:57.282 --> 00:05:11.539]  They'll come up to you, they'll approach you, some of them might be upset, but you have the opportunity to now sit down, open a dialogue, and explain to a new person that might not know what's really going on, and let them know why our country is in distress.
[00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.824]  So please go to InfoWarsStore and purchase your Save America t-shirt.
