[00:00:07.836 --> 00:00:12.202]  Jade Helm 15, a military exercise of grand scale.
[00:00:12.823 --> 00:00:19.933]  The military claims the exercise is for overseas training, yet three of these United States have been listed as hostile.
[00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:27.733]  The term mastering the human domain reveals to us that Jade Helm 15 is more than just a military exercise.
[00:00:28.273 --> 00:00:40.877]  It's also an exercise of the new field of geospatial intelligence, using human domain analytics to map the politics and thoughts of any nation, state, city, right down to the individual.
[00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:43.067]  Jade Helm 15.
[00:00:43.507 --> 00:00:47.969]  That's what the United States Army is calling a large-scale military exercise.
[00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.650]  Special Operations Command will be training with other armed units beginning in July.
[00:00:53.431 --> 00:01:03.215]  In a recent InfoWars.com report, Master the Human Domain, the domestic plan behind Jade Helm, we break down what the Jade Helm logo refers to.
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.366]  In brief, a new discipline in intelligence has been at center stage for the past decade.
[00:01:09.907 --> 00:01:11.969]  Activity-Based Intelligence or ABI.
[00:01:15.089 --> 00:01:44.265]  According to TrajectoryMagazine.com, the human domain or human dimension, which is a vital and integral part of ABI, is defined as the presence, activities including transactions both physical and virtual, culture, social structure, organization, networks and relationships, motivations, intent, vulnerabilities, and capabilities of humans, single or groups, across all domains of the operational environment, space, air,
[00:01:44.725 --> 00:01:46.486]  Maritime, Ground and Cyber.
[00:01:47.227 --> 00:01:55.833]  This article goes on to say that the focus on mastering the human domain was born out of a merging of three already existing disciplines of intelligence.
[00:01:56.894 --> 00:02:10.144]  That may be the case for this branding of this idea, but the exercise of mapping the human domain right down to the individual is a long-standing institutionalized strategy that has been going on for well over 100 years.
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:28.869]  What reason would the United States government have to invest so much time, resources, and money in order to pinpoint exact pockets of thought in a country founded on free thought, expression, and most of all outspoken words against its own government?
[00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.694]  During his famous farewell address, Eisenhower warned the American people of an imminent and internal threat, a scientific elite,
[00:02:38.484 --> 00:02:50.465]  We must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite.
[00:02:51.769 --> 00:03:01.271]  The title, Scientific Elite, to most Americans might seem like nothing more than ordinary intangible rhetoric, typically thrown around by politicians during their speeches.
[00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:05.792]  This time, however, Eisenhower was not speaking in abstractions.
[00:03:06.412 --> 00:03:08.633]  There actually is a scientific elite.
[00:03:11.613 --> 00:03:14.814]  Jade Helm 15 is anything but the American way.
[00:03:15.374 --> 00:03:19.975]  It's a domestic scientific control grid whose purpose is domination and control.
[00:03:21.522 --> 00:03:30.112]  A technological infrastructure for authoritarian political control is not the end goal, but a means to that end of eugenics.
[00:03:31.465 --> 00:03:56.745]  The term eugenics, coined by Charles Darwin's half-cousin Sir Francis Galton in 1883, is a science dedicated to the engineering of the human genome by selectively breeding those humans with what they consider to be desirable qualities, such as intelligence, athleticism, etc., and eliminating those humans without these attributes and all races of humans unlike their own.
[00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.871]  Out of this, race theory and race science was born.
[00:04:01.611 --> 00:04:12.656]  Karl Pearson, a protege of Galton, assembled a biometrics laboratory based out of the University of London in 1907 in order to collect data about people mostly based on race.
[00:04:13.156 --> 00:04:23.920]  He also published a journal entitled Biometrica, which became very influential with American scientists and financiers who were becoming extremely interested in the concept of eugenics.
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.242]  As this movement grew in popularity, top American industrialists threw their money into the game.
[00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:35.344]  Carnegie, Harriman, and Rockefeller were among the top contributors.
[00:04:36.024 --> 00:04:53.550]  California became the eugenics capital of the world, while on the East Coast, Cold Spring Harbor Research Facility, located on Long Island, was collecting and storing biometric information on average Americans in order to begin the elimination of families as well as entire races of people.
[00:04:54.667 --> 00:05:07.351]  Through the efforts of the California eugenicist, mostly through written pamphlets and endowments mostly from the Rockefellers and Harriman, the eugenics movement found a second home in Germany in the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.
[00:05:08.691 --> 00:05:21.895]  This pre-World War II, well-funded, international scientific community based around the eugenics movement was cementing its place as a standard in human academia when World War II broke out in full scale.
[00:05:23.117 --> 00:05:28.599]  The then CEO of IBM, Thomas J. Watson, worked hand-in-hand with Nazi Germany.
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:49.328]  In 1933, it was Watson who enthusiastically helped the Nazi plan and funded their national census, which according to historian Edwin Black in his 2001 publication, IBM and the Holocaust, the 1933 census with design help and tabulation services provided by IBM through its German subsidiary.
[00:05:49.648 --> 00:06:02.591]  Proved to be pivotal to the Nazis in their efforts to identify, isolate, and ultimately destroy the country's Jewish, Gypsy, and other minority communities as well as single out political opposition.
[00:06:03.331 --> 00:06:09.593]  While much of the world was forever altered by the events of the war, this eugenics-based community remained together.
[00:06:10.353 --> 00:06:19.890]  A similar and frighteningly more advanced version of this eugenics-based biometrics program is being tested right now under the name Jade Helm 15.
[00:06:21.567 --> 00:06:29.111]  While the term eugenics is no longer used in the mainstream openly, the practice of eugenics is still around and stronger than ever.
[00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:35.494]  Jade Helm 15 exercises the next generation of technology in the political domination arena.
[00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:45.319]  It is simply another technological step beyond the Cold Springs Harbor Research Facility's biometrics program or Thomas J. Watson's census of Germany.
[00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:53.384]  And their disciplines developed during the eugenics heyday in the early 20th century are still being practiced in advance today.
[00:06:53.964 --> 00:07:10.916]  Mandatory toxic vaccines, abortion, family courts, contaminated water, and of course biometrics are just a few of the branches that grew out of the original eugenics trunk, still present and dominating over our society today.
[00:07:12.242 --> 00:07:25.912]  In 2010, the GEOINT Symposium and Annual Geointelligence, Geospatial and Activity-Based Intelligence Conference held a presentation entitled, Mastering the Human Domain.
[00:07:26.452 --> 00:07:31.056]  Geospatial Intelligence and Human Geography were the main talking points.
[00:07:31.996 --> 00:07:35.299]  Jade Helm is born and begins to take form.
[00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:43.624]  The human domain encompasses the totality of the physical, cultural, and social environments that influence human behavior.
[00:07:44.144 --> 00:07:51.307]  Explained Admiral McRaven, success in this domain won't be achieved by traditional ground, naval, or air forces.
[00:07:52.007 --> 00:08:01.691]  Instead, success in the human domain will depend upon understanding the human terrain and establishing trust with those individuals who occupy that space.
[00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:07.953]  The goal is to see if groups of these special forces can move around the civilian population without being noticed.
[00:08:07.973 --> 00:08:11.934]  You know, blend in so they can place themselves in strategic positions.
[00:08:12.494 --> 00:08:14.075]  McRaven continued by saying,
[00:08:21.897 --> 00:08:39.473]  A living active map where human beings are movable real-time landmarks and everyone's personal thoughts, feelings, medical information, belief systems, history, basically every shred of information about the individuals in any region on that map will make up the terrain.
[00:08:39.974 --> 00:08:44.117]  When mastering the human domain, the special operators are the masters.
[00:08:44.578 --> 00:08:47.701]  They are the key that turns this whole machine on.
[00:08:49.295 --> 00:09:09.059]  And regardless of whether the military calls this project Activity-Based Intelligence, ABI, Geospatial Intelligence, coupled with Human Domain Analytics, what we are looking at is the nexus between private tech firms, homeland security and law enforcement, domestic surveillance, and the domestic use of special forces.
[00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.439]  How is any of this legal?
[00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:16.580]  How is any of this not a violation of the Fourth Amendment?
[00:09:18.348 --> 00:09:28.271]  In this animated short, Plandopolis, scarcity and poverty are the norm, and the entire population is dependent on smart technology in order to survive.
[00:09:28.672 --> 00:09:46.798]  In this piece of predictive programming, we are introduced to what is now known as the Internet of Things, a world of smart machines that are equipped with sensors that will be able to determine all of your physical activities in real time as you interact with machines and objects in your everyday life.
[00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:55.521]  Every appliance, tabletop, light bulb and now even your guns will be connected to the net and equipped with GPS.
[00:09:56.101 --> 00:09:59.882]  This data will also be included when analyzing the human domain.
[00:10:00.302 --> 00:10:03.483]  The human geographical map is present in the physical world.
[00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:05.644]  As well as the virtual world.
[00:10:06.205 --> 00:10:14.951]  Once the operators of Jade Helm fully master the human domain, these social controllers can then proceed with the next stage of their engineered plan.
[00:10:15.292 --> 00:10:19.695]  Local roundup exercises have been videotaped in South Beach, Florida.
[00:10:20.736 --> 00:10:31.184]  Our own InfoWars reporters David Knight and Joe Biggs visited a top-secret military training facility to prepare for urban missions here in the United States.
[00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:41.776]  Newcomers are making their move, like data mining tech company Palantir, who have been working with the military-industrial complex for years.
[00:10:42.456 --> 00:10:51.001]  Bilderberg member regulars Peter Thiel and Alex Karp founded Palantir using venture capital money from the CIA's In-Q-Tel.
[00:10:51.662 --> 00:10:54.944]  And many more startups like this one are on the way.
[00:10:55.564 --> 00:10:59.907]  Palantir will now be expanding from the battlefield to the VA.
[00:11:02.418 --> 00:11:17.808]  IBM Watson Health Cloud, which is now being phased into A-Doctors when they're diagnosing patients, will be able to sift through millions of available medical documents a second and form a medical opinion using technologies provided by Palantir.
[00:11:19.246 --> 00:11:35.457]  The Watson Health Cloud will not only have access to documents, but it will track, trace, and store people's medical conditions in live time via the latest fitness wristbands, eyewatches, etc., which upload your vitals via wireless internet.
[00:11:36.218 --> 00:11:40.341]  Watson will eliminate the doctor's responsibility of misdiagnosis.
[00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:43.942]  Blame can be put on the computer or its programmers.
[00:11:44.482 --> 00:11:46.682]  But who exactly are these programmers?
[00:11:47.402 --> 00:11:51.503]  In a system like this, responsibility can be deferred indefinitely.
[00:11:51.523 --> 00:12:05.186]  A society that has put all of its trust in the recommendations of the IBM computer Watson, which can autonomously recommend diagnosis and recommend treatments with no responsibility to anyone.
[00:12:05.926 --> 00:12:09.087]  And advise that certain patients receive no treatment whatsoever.
[00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:14.230]  In other words, a fully automated robotic death panel.
[00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:20.152]  One specific demographic is directly in the crosshairs of this new threat, U.S.
[00:12:20.212 --> 00:12:20.672]  veterans.
[00:12:21.732 --> 00:12:27.235]  According to an IBM News release from December 16, 2014, the U.S.
[00:12:27.255 --> 00:12:38.459]  Department of Veteran Affairs, VA, is using Watson technology in a pilot to assist physicians in helping accelerate the process of evidence-based medical decision making.
[00:12:39.562 --> 00:12:52.270]  A tech startup, Recorded Future, that uses a system of filtering through and classifying open source data, demonstrated their predictive analytics capability during the 2012 GEOINT conference.
[00:12:52.991 --> 00:12:58.314]  Trajectory Magazine reports, the concept is to find people who are talking about the future.
[00:12:58.915 --> 00:13:01.897]  Vice President for Recorded Future, Matt Kodema says,
[00:13:02.577 --> 00:13:04.558]  We can basically roll back the clock.
[00:13:04.918 --> 00:13:08.960]  We know that this particular did happen in this time at this place.
[00:13:09.381 --> 00:13:12.922]  Now let's go back a week before that and look at the publications.
[00:13:13.403 --> 00:13:14.984]  Who was predicting that accurately?
[00:13:15.404 --> 00:13:15.924]  Who wasn't?
[00:13:16.784 --> 00:13:30.892]  Add this layer of predictive analytics on top of the other human domain analytic and you begin to get an idea of the scope and range of the overarching inescapable control grid these scientific controllers are constructing.
[00:13:32.085 --> 00:13:44.851]  At the same GEOINT conference in 2012, Jeff Jonas, the Chief Scientist for IBM Entity Analytics and an IBM Fellow, talked about the potential for open source data utilization.
[00:13:45.332 --> 00:13:52.135]  He said, in typical IBM tradition, space, time, travel data is the ultimate biometric.
[00:13:52.955 --> 00:13:59.999]  It seems that IBM and the scientific elite's perspective shifted from the master race to mastering the human domain.
[00:14:02.344 --> 00:14:11.670]  So we probably won't see doors kicked in and military trucks shipping political opponents to their demise during this summer's Jade Helm 15 military procedure.
[00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:20.936]  However, as Brzezinski states in Between Two Ages, the technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society.
[00:14:21.676 --> 00:14:31.222]  Just like Watson's census was not the end sought by the Nazis, neither is Jade Helm 15 an end, but a means to a historically predictable end.
[00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:46.833]  We must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite.
[00:14:47.254 --> 00:14:57.940]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:15:00.222 --> 00:15:04.547]  This is Jakari Jackson reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:26.464]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:15:26.484 --> 00:15:27.685]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:15:28.366 --> 00:15:34.991]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:15:35.471 --> 00:15:36.352]  This is sustainable.
[00:15:36.752 --> 00:15:41.016]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:15:41.376 --> 00:15:44.919]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:48.102]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:15:48.582 --> 00:15:53.406]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:15:53.926 --> 00:15:55.787]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:15:56.148 --> 00:16:00.571]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:02.792]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:16:03.393 --> 00:16:04.894]  This is what you're actually designed to run on?
[00:16:05.014 --> 00:16:05.154]  Exactly.
[00:16:05.174 --> 00:16:09.077]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:16:09.602 --> 00:16:17.025]  And that's the principle of Infowars life as far as I understand that you've always had is that it's not about synthetic chemicals and forcing actions.
[00:16:17.225 --> 00:16:25.309]  It's about letting your body do its own thing and giving your body the tools it needs to create these different compounds that are super valuable and super beneficial.
[00:16:25.689 --> 00:16:27.690]  We've all been dumbed down, whether we know it or not.
[00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.890]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:31.431]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:16:31.451 --> 00:16:34.951]  I mean, we're looking at the television screen, at least, you know, for research purposes.
[00:16:35.011 --> 00:16:40.073]  Whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:16:40.413 --> 00:16:48.455]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
