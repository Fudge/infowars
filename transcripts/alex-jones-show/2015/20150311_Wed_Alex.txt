[00:00:00.997 --> 00:00:03.610]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:16.297 --> 00:00:16.938]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:18.620]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:20.462]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:21.123 --> 00:00:21.944]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.705 --> 00:00:23.626]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:27.912]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.452 --> 00:00:32.498]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.127 --> 00:00:35.288]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:35.428 --> 00:00:41.311]  I'm David Knight, your host today, although Alex is going to be joining us right after the news, and we have a lot of news.
[00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:47.255]  If Charlie Sheen was here, he would say, winning, because we're winning across the board.
[00:00:47.275 --> 00:00:49.616]  Of course, we already knew that Hillary Clinton was a liar.
[00:00:50.076 --> 00:00:51.557]  She proved that yesterday.
[00:00:51.617 --> 00:01:02.864]  She got caught in the lie just before she went to the United Nations Security Council and talked about how she was using her private email server in her home out of convenience, and how she was using it to
[00:01:03.644 --> 00:01:04.604]  Email Bill Clinton.
[00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:15.808]  The Clinton spokesman had said just a couple hours before that that Bill Clinton did two emails his entire life and specifically said when those two emails were.
[00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:17.689]  So she got caught in her lie.
[00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.690]  The ATF got caught in a power grab.
[00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.790]  That's a big win.
[00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:27.852]  The Second Amendment activists have forced the ATF to shelve the Obama ammo ban.
[00:01:27.872 --> 00:01:30.933]  80,000 Americans bombard government with complaints.
[00:01:30.953 --> 00:01:32.774]  This is a story up on Infowars.com.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.882]  We also have a big victory in the health fronts.
[00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:51.253]  Of course, we learned last week that McDonald's said they were going to back off and no longer do antibiotics in chicken, and that has huge ramifications, because the reason that they give antibiotics so much to chickens is because of the way that they're raised.
[00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:57.438]  You're not going to be able to raise the chickens under these kind of horrible factory conditions.
[00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:01.713]  And I say horrible not only for the chickens, but for the people who eat the chickens.
[00:02:02.013 --> 00:02:06.796]  You're not going to be able to raise the chickens in those kind of conditions if you don't pump them up with antibiotics.
[00:02:07.536 --> 00:02:15.121]  They have modified them genetically or through selective breeding to have incredibly large breasts to grow very rapidly.
[00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:17.882]  They can't even stand on their own, so they're laying down on the ground.
[00:02:17.902 --> 00:02:18.883]  But it's not just the ground.
[00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:25.193]  It's a deep level of waste and excrement from the previous generation of chickens.
[00:02:25.213 --> 00:02:26.374]  And so they get these infections.
[00:02:26.454 --> 00:02:27.954]  It rubs the feathers off of them.
[00:02:27.994 --> 00:02:28.795]  They get infections.
[00:02:29.455 --> 00:02:31.015]  That's why they pump them up with antibiotics.
[00:02:31.076 --> 00:02:33.917]  But now, this week, we have a story up on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:34.537 --> 00:02:36.798]  McDonald's is talking about putting kale
[00:02:37.478 --> 00:02:37.838]  I don't know.
[00:02:51.243 --> 00:02:58.386]  I've been loading up their products with things that are used to make rubber mats, for example, or just chemicals that are preservatives.
[00:02:58.586 --> 00:03:03.888]  The reason they do that is to give them longer shelf life, to make the logistics easier.
[00:03:04.148 --> 00:03:07.729]  It's very difficult to handle fresh produce.
[00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.190]  You have a lot of loss with that.
[00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.031]  That's why it's so expensive to buy it in the grocery store.
[00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:13.932]  That's why it's so cheap to go eat at McDonald's.
[00:03:13.972 --> 00:03:16.853]  That's why poor people are so obese is because they
[00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:23.339]  Feel like they can't afford, in many cases, to eat fresh vegetables, let alone organic vegetables.
[00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:26.202]  So it's going to be a real challenge for McDonald's, but it's a victory.
[00:03:26.562 --> 00:03:30.827]  Because they're not doing this, as the New York Times pointed out, because people's tastes have changed.
[00:03:31.247 --> 00:03:33.630]  They're doing it because people have been educated.
[00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.152]  They understand what the health implications of this are.
[00:03:37.753 --> 00:03:39.254]  And so that's why they're changing.
[00:03:39.854 --> 00:03:44.938]  That's why when they announced that they were going to restructure their menu, the first thing they said was going to remove antibiotics.
[00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:47.140]  There's no taste to the antibiotics.
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.022]  It's because of people's health concerns that they're doing that.
[00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:53.144]  Another huge victory, again, in Floridation.
[00:03:53.204 --> 00:03:55.927]  This one, a story from Newsweek.
[00:03:56.667 --> 00:04:10.775]  We just had a story last week from the Telegraph in the UK, talking about how they had looked at the health effects on the thyroid in the UK, looking at areas where there was no fluoridation or where there was light fluoridation versus areas where there was heavy fluoridation.
[00:04:10.795 --> 00:04:16.598]  And they could see a distinct problem coming on with the thyroid, making people obese, making them depressed.
[00:04:16.978 --> 00:04:18.279]  And of course, there's been other studies.
[00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:19.900]  Pointing to brain damage.
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:30.814]  Now this new study that has been done in the United States is showing that there is a correlation to fluoridation and much higher ADHD rates.
[00:04:31.335 --> 00:04:32.336]  Much, much higher.
[00:04:32.576 --> 00:04:35.460]  They even go through, and we'll talk about this after the break in detail,
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:57.707]  They even go through and quantize this in a model saying if you add 1% fluoridation every 1% increase rather in the portion of the US population drinking fluoride is going to correspond to 67,000 cases of ADHD 11 years later and it continued to increase as they took the time frame out to 131 cases by 2011.
[00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:03.469]  So we're going to talk about that in detail and we're going to talk about even though we're winning
[00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:05.590]  We still have to continue to fight.
[00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.192]  New York wants to start paying people to snitch on idling motors.
[00:05:09.332 --> 00:05:10.333]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:05:10.453 --> 00:05:13.955]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:18.077]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:18.397 --> 00:05:19.858]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:25.201]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:05:25.502 --> 00:05:27.763]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[00:05:28.043 --> 00:05:28.884]  But for how long?
[00:05:29.184 --> 00:05:30.705]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com.
[00:05:31.445 --> 00:05:35.436]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor dot com.
[00:05:35.817 --> 00:05:37.020]  Infidel Body Armor.
[00:05:37.682 --> 00:05:38.644]  Just won't quit.
[00:05:40.049 --> 00:05:43.251]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:51.597]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:51.817 --> 00:05:56.821]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:05:57.241 --> 00:05:59.523]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:05:59.763 --> 00:06:01.564]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:06:10.465 --> 00:06:11.306]  Alex Jones here.
[00:06:11.386 --> 00:06:20.457]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:06:20.618 --> 00:06:25.864]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[00:06:26.184 --> 00:06:29.685]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:06:29.906 --> 00:06:39.249]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.
[00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:50.634]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity.
[00:06:50.874 --> 00:06:55.656]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts
[00:06:55.856 --> 00:06:58.857]  With exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[00:06:59.217 --> 00:07:02.498]  Now is the time to secure ancient defense for you and your family.

[00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:15.930]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:20.576]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[00:07:20.876 --> 00:07:28.586]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:07:28.806 --> 00:07:34.031]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:07:34.331 --> 00:07:39.916]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:07:40.277 --> 00:07:45.101]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[00:07:45.241 --> 00:07:48.825]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:07:49.165 --> 00:07:55.468]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:07:55.768 --> 00:08:00.770]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.471]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.552]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:08:13.095 --> 00:08:19.122]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:19.722 --> 00:08:22.706]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.151]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:29.372 --> 00:08:30.192]  I am David Knight.
[00:08:30.413 --> 00:08:38.521]  On this Wednesday, March 11th, 2015, I'll be hosting the show, but Alex Jones is going to be joining us in just a few minutes after the news.
[00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:49.913]  In this segment, we're also going to play a report from Rob Dew that ran last night on the Nightly News, talking about how aborted fetuses are being used as a commodity.
[00:08:51.001 --> 00:08:56.562]  Let me explain to you that we all see children as human resources of some type.
[00:08:56.782 --> 00:09:00.803]  We can respect them as persons or we can use them as commodities.
[00:09:01.784 --> 00:09:05.885]  Rob Dew did this story last night and then today we saw this story about Iran.
[00:09:05.905 --> 00:09:12.246]  They're going to ban vasectomies, they're going to curb abortion and contraceptives because they want more people.
[00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:14.467]  They want to get their population from 77 million to 200 million.
[00:09:16.345 --> 00:09:24.208]  But of course, we have governments in the West and corporations in the West who see children as a different kind of resource.
[00:09:24.969 --> 00:09:29.450]  They want to harvest aborted feces organs and use them commercially.
[00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.432]  So that's the report we're going to have from Rob Dew in just a couple of minutes.
[00:09:32.552 --> 00:09:34.793]  But first, this breaking news.
[00:09:34.853 --> 00:09:37.354]  Of course, we had a major victory yesterday.
[00:09:37.374 --> 00:09:38.514]  We've had several victories.
[00:09:38.534 --> 00:09:40.115]  I was just talking about that in the last segment.
[00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.011]  We have beaten back the ATF for now.
[00:09:43.071 --> 00:09:49.435]  They wanted to begin a framework that was going to ban all ammunition, piece by piece.
[00:09:50.116 --> 00:09:51.357]  But they've been turned back for right now.
[00:09:51.397 --> 00:09:53.178]  We've got an article up on Infowars.com.
[00:09:53.198 --> 00:09:57.280]  Second Amendment activists forced the ATF to shelve Obama ammo ban.
[00:09:57.961 --> 00:10:00.503]  80,000 Americans bombard the government with complaints.
[00:10:01.303 --> 00:10:08.494]  They said, surprisingly, you know, most, this is what the ATF said, most viewed the proposed regulation negatively.
[00:10:08.514 --> 00:10:10.236]  Yeah, that's an understatement.
[00:10:10.256 --> 00:10:14.582]  They said the vast majority of comments received to date are critical of the framework.
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.722]  And so this deserves further study.
[00:10:18.142 --> 00:10:22.885]  The ATF accordingly will not at this time seek to issue a final framework.
[00:10:23.606 --> 00:10:26.208]  Let me explain to you what their framework is.
[00:10:26.228 --> 00:10:33.513]  What they're calling a framework is merely the idea that they've come up with a rationale for banning ammunition.
[00:10:34.554 --> 00:10:50.838]  And just like playing the game of hangman, they're going to add one piece at a time until they have completely destroyed your God-given rights, respected by the Constitution, that the government agents have to swear to uphold to become government agents.
[00:10:51.178 --> 00:10:54.979]  That's what they appeal to for their authority, and they want to destroy that.
[00:10:55.139 --> 00:10:59.960]  They ignore it, and they want to remove it, because that removes their obvious criminal liability.
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.822]  But that's what the Second Amendment said would happen.
[00:11:03.083 --> 00:11:05.946]  They said it would be a gradual process of infringement.
[00:11:06.647 --> 00:11:10.211]  Putting one piece in at a time, just like you're playing the game of hangman.
[00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:13.855]  They said, of course, they're going to go back and they're going to look at this again.
[00:11:13.895 --> 00:11:17.219]  There's going to be additional open and transparent processes.
[00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:18.200]  Yeah, right.
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:18.821]  Okay.
[00:11:19.361 --> 00:11:25.405]  Well, at least they were more transparent and more responsive than the FCC, who came out and said, we're going to take over the Internet.
[00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:28.426]  We're not going to tell you how we're going to do it.
[00:11:28.627 --> 00:11:30.828]  We're only going to tell you why.
[00:11:31.028 --> 00:11:32.949]  It's to protect net neutrality.
[00:11:33.009 --> 00:11:35.931]  We're going to fix the Internet because, you know, the Internet is broken.
[00:11:36.771 --> 00:11:37.272]  No, it's not.
[00:11:38.372 --> 00:11:42.795]  And they still haven't, after a week, shown us what the proposed regulations were going to be.
[00:11:43.155 --> 00:11:47.478]  The FCC is starting to control the Internet, and they're worse than the ATF already.
[00:11:48.356 --> 00:11:49.876]  Who's been going after the Second Amendment?
[00:11:50.357 --> 00:11:59.479]  They pass regulation, they don't let anybody look at it, including our elected representatives, and then they have this regulation passed for over a week, and we still haven't seen it.
[00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:01.900]  Not the public, not our elected representatives.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.121]  Gun Owners of America had this comment.
[00:12:04.161 --> 00:12:10.903]  They said, this was supposed to, these regulations have been put out for public comment up until March the 16th for the ATF.
[00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:14.160]  Now they have backed that down five days early.
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.901]  That is a major victory.
[00:12:16.122 --> 00:12:22.929]  And not only were there 80,000 people sending a comment to them, but they also got comments from over 200 congressmen.
[00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:24.070]  There you go.
[00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.134]  But they say that they tried to make a good faith interpretation of law.
[00:12:27.174 --> 00:12:28.155]  This is what the ATF said.
[00:12:28.395 --> 00:12:32.599]  We tried to make a good faith interpretation of law, and of course this deserves further study.
[00:12:33.328 --> 00:12:33.788]  No, it doesn't.
[00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:35.110]  But they're going to come back.
[00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.672]  But we beat them this time, and we can beat them again.
[00:12:37.692 --> 00:12:45.199]  And I think one of the things we need to do is go on the offense against these empire-building bureaucracies that never stop.
[00:12:45.239 --> 00:12:48.622]  And the ATF is one example of many examples of that.
[00:12:49.062 --> 00:12:55.867]  Now, we're not going to have time to get into this before we play Rob's report, but there's another victory today, this one on water fluoridation.
[00:12:56.267 --> 00:12:59.009]  The studies are coming out almost on a weekly basis.
[00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:13.899]  It was just in February the 23rd that we saw a study from the British paper, The Telegraph, looking at the effects on the thyroid in Britain in areas where there was heavy fluoridation versus areas where there was light fluoridation, where there was no fluoridation.
[00:13:13.939 --> 00:13:18.802]  Because, fortunately for the British, they have a lot of areas where there is no fluoridation.
[00:13:19.502 --> 00:13:25.126]  In America, it's simply a question of how much fluoride are they dumping in the water based on different areas.
[00:13:25.146 --> 00:13:28.668]  And so what they did was they did a study here in the United States.
[00:13:29.068 --> 00:13:31.770]  This is a study that's been published in the journal Environmental Health.
[00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:38.594]  It found that states with higher portion of artificially fluoridated water had a higher prevalence of ADHD.
[00:13:39.114 --> 00:13:43.097]  They said this relationship held up across six different years that they looked at.
[00:13:43.917 --> 00:13:57.202]  To sum it up, they said states in which a greater proportion of people received artificially fluoridated water in 1992 tended to have a greater proportion of children and adolescents who received ADHD diagnoses after controlling for socioeconomic status.
[00:13:57.222 --> 00:14:01.164]  In other words, they looked at Delaware, for example, and Iowa.
[00:14:01.464 --> 00:14:06.666]  Both states have relatively low poverty rates, but they have heavily fluoridated water and have heavy
[00:14:06.886 --> 00:14:07.046]  I think?
[00:14:24.211 --> 00:14:36.796]  67,000, sorry, additional cases of ADHD 11 years later, and an additional 131 cases by 2011 after controlling for socioeconomic status.
[00:14:36.816 --> 00:14:38.256]  In other words, about 20 years later.
[00:14:38.756 --> 00:14:41.337]  So they even quantized it.
[00:14:42.097 --> 00:14:46.119]  But we'll come back to this later on in the broadcast, and I want to get your comments on this.
[00:14:46.159 --> 00:14:52.621]  But let's go to this report from Rob Dew about how some corporations view human resources of children.
[00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:06.301]  How old are you, in real time?
[00:15:06.541 --> 00:15:06.301]  28.
[00:15:06.701 --> 00:15:06.841]  I'm 105.
[00:15:07.381 --> 00:15:10.943]  If you had as much time as I have, what would you do with it?
[00:15:11.423 --> 00:15:15.245]  If I had all that time, I sure as hell wouldn't waste it.
[00:15:16.386 --> 00:15:21.388]  The movie End Time seems to be a perfect metaphor for what's going on in our daily lives now.
[00:15:21.788 --> 00:15:30.332]  We don't seem to ever have enough time, even though with all this great technology and all these advances, we're still always running behind, trying to catch up, never getting enough done.
[00:15:31.448 --> 00:15:32.730]  Come on, come on, help yourselves!
[00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:33.832]  Take the time, it's free!
[00:15:34.172 --> 00:15:36.435]  You put enough time in the wrong hands.
[00:15:36.676 --> 00:15:37.998]  You upset the whole system.
[00:15:38.058 --> 00:15:38.538]  Let's hope so.
[00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:43.139]  Well, Google may have a solution for that, as they do for everything else.
[00:15:43.539 --> 00:15:47.622]  In fact, there's a Google executive that thinks we can live to be up to 500 years old.
[00:15:48.082 --> 00:15:52.784]  Bloomberg Business reported that Google Ventures' CEO is in the search for immortality.
[00:15:53.365 --> 00:16:02.490]  That's right, Bill Marris has up to $425 million a year that he can spend on venture projects out there, and he's looking for companies that will slow aging, reverse disease, and extend life.
[00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:08.493]  Google Ventures has close to $2 billion in assets under management, with stakes in more than 280 startups.
[00:16:09.013 --> 00:16:19.999]  They fund things like Google Glass, driverless cars, SpaceX, and Google X is working on a pill that would insert nanoparticles into our bloodstream to detect disease and cancer mutations.
[00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:22.921]  But how will we pay for this immortality?
[00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:24.802]  And what will be the cost to you and I?
[00:16:25.183 --> 00:16:27.104]  Will it be through xenotransplantation?
[00:16:27.605 --> 00:16:33.650]  Where they take actual organs from aborted babies and grow them inside rats and other animals and then implant them into you?
[00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:37.874]  Do you want to be responsible for the death of another human being so you could live longer?
[00:16:38.865 --> 00:16:43.087]  Well, there's a biotech company in Redwood City, California, which is doing just that.
[00:16:43.747 --> 00:16:52.172]  The California company Ganogen removes the organs from aborted babies, transplants them into a rat or pig, and allows them to grow so they can be transplanted into a human.
[00:16:52.492 --> 00:16:54.653]  Work has initially been done on kidneys.
[00:16:55.461 --> 00:16:58.665]  WorldNetDaily seems to be one of the only publications talking about this.
[00:16:59.046 --> 00:16:59.967]  They have a couple articles.
[00:17:00.147 --> 00:17:06.835]  One, scientists grow kidneys of aborted babies and animals, and an aborted baby organ program called FrankenScience.
[00:17:07.756 --> 00:17:11.721]  This is one way we're turning our children into commodities, and they're not even being born yet.
[00:17:12.322 --> 00:17:15.903]  Now, after they're born, we have the CPS that goes around and traffics children.
[00:17:16.083 --> 00:17:20.324]  In fact, Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services is under state investigation.
[00:17:20.644 --> 00:17:28.525]  The LA Department of Children and Family Services has been under fire in recent years with official commissions investigating high-profile deaths of children who've come in contact with the foster care system.
[00:17:29.065 --> 00:17:40.648]  Investigators are looking into allegations that officials in Los Angeles DCFS office engaged in a series of baby trafficking activities and cover-up extending back 15 years involving possibly large numbers of babies.
[00:17:41.368 --> 00:17:42.789]  And these kids had a high price tag.
[00:17:43.149 --> 00:17:52.954]  They estimate that 21,000 kids that went through this system, they were getting $25,000 apiece for them, and taking them out of the system and transferring them to families with these large fees.
[00:17:53.634 --> 00:18:00.798]  And so, the supervisors are getting kickbacks, the employees are getting kickbacks, so what they need is more kids, so they go after your family.
[00:18:01.298 --> 00:18:02.799]  Oh, you don't want vaccines for your kids?
[00:18:02.839 --> 00:18:04.040]  Maybe we're going to call CPS.
[00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:09.164]  Oh, you don't want to treat your kid for eczema using the steroid cream like the CPS recommends?
[00:18:09.384 --> 00:18:10.465]  Well, we're going to take your kids.
[00:18:10.705 --> 00:18:12.847]  And that's what happened to a family in Washington State recently.
[00:18:13.107 --> 00:18:18.872]  They had a home birth of twins, and they didn't want to bring them to the doctor because they felt their kid's immune system hasn't been developed yet.
[00:18:19.272 --> 00:18:23.095]  Well, due to pressure from their family, they called the paramedics to come check on their kids.
[00:18:23.115 --> 00:18:25.857]  The paramedics said the kids are fine, but they recommend they bring them to a doctor.
[00:18:26.118 --> 00:18:28.780]  And they said, no, we're going to wait until their immune systems get better.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.343]  Well, the next day, CPS shows up and goes, hey, your kid has eczema.
[00:18:32.363 --> 00:18:34.144]  We recommend this steroid cream.
[00:18:34.164 --> 00:18:37.587]  And they go, well, we're treating it with natural antibiotics.
[00:18:37.947 --> 00:18:39.188]  And creams like coconut oil.
[00:18:39.208 --> 00:18:42.089]  And they said, no, if you're not using the steroid cream, we're going to take your kids.
[00:18:42.349 --> 00:18:43.510]  So they took their kids for a while.
[00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:44.470]  Then they got them back.
[00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.691]  But now they're under investigation.
[00:18:45.711 --> 00:18:47.551]  They're under the heel of the CPS.
[00:18:47.591 --> 00:18:51.973]  And if they don't march and cross every T and dot every I, they're going to come and take their kids.
[00:18:52.714 --> 00:18:55.275]  And because of that oppression, they decided to flee the state.
[00:18:55.575 --> 00:18:57.296]  Well, then they got busted down in California.
[00:18:57.736 --> 00:19:03.158]  And before being arrested, the mother, Carrie Ringo, actually told a cameraman, send a message to America for me.
[00:19:03.438 --> 00:19:04.999]  Children don't belong to the government.
[00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:06.520]  The government belongs to the people.
[00:19:07.608 --> 00:19:10.510]  When our children become commodities, it lessens their value.
[00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:13.011]  You can't put a value on human life.
[00:19:13.251 --> 00:19:13.952]  You really can't.
[00:19:14.532 --> 00:19:21.817]  Although they're trying to do that with this healthcare system, where they're going to have to budget healthcare for you, and we may have to create death panels.
[00:19:21.837 --> 00:19:24.118]  They're trying to put a price tag on human life.
[00:19:24.138 --> 00:19:26.900]  They're trying to say, some lives aren't worth as much as others.
[00:19:28.161 --> 00:19:33.504]  And pretty soon, hey, like Will.i.am said in Rolling Stone, eventually 3D printing will print people.
[00:19:33.524 --> 00:19:34.825]  In fact, here's his quote.
[00:19:35.782 --> 00:19:37.303]  You can print in freaking protein.
[00:19:37.383 --> 00:19:38.504]  You can make freaking meat.
[00:19:38.884 --> 00:19:39.645]  You can print leather.
[00:19:39.885 --> 00:19:40.666]  You can print a liver.
[00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:47.151]  So, if you can print a liver or a kidney, god dang it, you're going to be able to print a whole freaking person, and that's scary.
[00:19:47.972 --> 00:19:48.872]  Yeah, that is scary.
[00:19:49.213 --> 00:19:54.477]  We may split into that human species, that subservient class and that master class, a lot earlier than H.G.
[00:19:54.517 --> 00:19:55.398]  Wells ever predicted.
[00:19:56.098 --> 00:20:02.487]  So try to remember that when you see headlines like Google exec says we can live to be 500 or forever or we're going to merge with machines.
[00:20:02.888 --> 00:20:06.413]  Look at the human cost now and ask yourself, is it worth it?
[00:20:06.433 --> 00:20:09.397]  This has been Rob Dew for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:20:11.762 --> 00:20:16.085]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:16.265 --> 00:20:21.830]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:25.352]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:23:12.132 --> 00:23:14.732]  I gotta tell you, I didn't want to buy any more firearms.
[00:23:15.172 --> 00:23:17.873]  I didn't want a paperwork trail headed back to Big Brother.
[00:23:18.253 --> 00:23:19.873]  I want 100% privacy.
[00:23:20.333 --> 00:23:22.293]  I want to be an invisible gun owner.
[00:23:22.353 --> 00:23:22.733]  Hello?
[00:23:23.053 --> 00:23:27.014]  So Mark says, hey, you know, Guns80.com, Ghost AR-15.
[00:23:27.914 --> 00:23:29.174]  Ghost means invisible.

[00:23:45.267 --> 00:23:47.948]  I still get angina, even with four stents.
[00:23:48.448 --> 00:23:51.029]  I was taking nitro two or three times a week.
[00:23:51.369 --> 00:23:55.971]  The very first day after taking Heart and Body Extract, the chest pain was gone.
[00:23:56.391 --> 00:23:58.232]  Now I don't wear a nitro patch.

[00:25:01.479 --> 00:25:04.900]  People are viewing us, how they're viewing us, not as persons.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.941]  They're viewing us simply as commodities.
[00:25:08.341 --> 00:25:19.864]  Commodities to be used for their purposes, organs to be harvested, as he pointed out, and we just see this kind of genetic suicide that's going on in the United States.
[00:25:19.884 --> 00:25:23.946]  It's just unbelievable to see how the elites are pushing this.
[00:25:23.986 --> 00:25:27.887]  And one of the areas that they're pushing it, that I was talking about just before the break, was water fluoridation.
[00:25:28.649 --> 00:25:31.593]  We know that it is very expensive for local communities to put this in.
[00:25:31.954 --> 00:25:32.394]  The U.S.
[00:25:32.455 --> 00:25:36.921]  is by far and away the most heavily fluoridated country in the world.
[00:25:37.562 --> 00:25:39.044]  Many areas they don't fluoridate at all.
[00:25:39.084 --> 00:25:44.832]  When I was in Denmark and Copenhagen, we were looking at the, reporting on the Bilderberg meeting
[00:25:45.595 --> 00:25:54.799]  People came up to me and they said, one guy in particular said, my friends think you guys are lunatics because you're talking about how the government is fluoridating the water.
[00:25:54.959 --> 00:25:58.840]  They can't believe that the government in America would put fluoride in the water.
[00:25:59.421 --> 00:26:04.263]  Well we've had another study, this one as I was pointing out from Newsweek, actually quantifying
[00:26:05.083 --> 00:26:10.627]  The effect, in terms of adding fluoridation, the number of ADHD cases that we get.
[00:26:10.667 --> 00:26:15.930]  And of course, the mechanism that they're talking about here, and this is Newsweek Magazine reporting this, so I guess you can believe it.
[00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.912]  You won't believe it when we tell you, when we point to other studies.
[00:26:19.212 --> 00:26:23.355]  This is a study done within the United States, held up over six years, this trend.
[00:26:23.695 --> 00:26:32.623]  They were looking at the different levels of fluoridation because it's pretty hard to find areas in America where there isn't fluoridation to compare it against places that are heavily fluoridated.
[00:26:32.643 --> 00:26:35.185]  So they looked at how heavily fluoridated it was.
[00:26:35.645 --> 00:26:38.388]  And this is a scientist at the University of Massachusetts, Hamhurst.
[00:26:38.908 --> 00:26:39.248]  I don't know.
[00:26:59.108 --> 00:27:01.030]  Increased from 7% to 11%.
[00:27:02.051 --> 00:27:03.732]  They actually quantified it.
[00:27:03.852 --> 00:27:17.924]  They said for every 1% of the population that you fluoridate the water, you wind up with 67,000 additional cases over about a 10-year period, and over a 20-year period you wound up with 131,000 additional cases.
[00:27:17.984 --> 00:27:18.924]  So it accumulates.
[00:27:19.265 --> 00:27:23.728]  We had a study that came out just February 23rd in Britain, where they were talking about thyroid damage.
[00:27:24.049 --> 00:27:26.551]  They quantified it as well, in a different way.
[00:27:27.051 --> 00:27:32.634]  They said, we see thyroid damage that creates obesity and depression in people.
[00:27:33.034 --> 00:27:36.996]  We see that happening at the level of 0.3 parts per million.
[00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:43.459]  Well, what are the levels that are allowed for water fluoridation in the United States?
[00:27:43.739 --> 00:27:44.000]  0.7 to 1.2.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.722]  In other words, 2 to 4 times the level that they saw thyroid damage in the UK.
[00:27:49.702 --> 00:27:52.164]  The EPA allows 4 parts per million.
[00:27:52.564 --> 00:27:56.546]  That's more than 10 times the level that they saw damage to the thyroid.
[00:27:58.157 --> 00:27:58.677]  No problem.
[00:28:00.058 --> 00:28:04.241]  Why would they push back against us when we've been talking about this?
[00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:05.382]  There's been ample studies.
[00:28:05.602 --> 00:28:15.008]  We've had studies in China talking about the influence on intellectual activity, on IQ, the drop in IQ based on high levels of fluoridation.
[00:28:15.748 --> 00:28:21.532]  The question is, when you look at this and you say, well, they're allowing two to four times the level in fluoridation.
[00:28:21.652 --> 00:28:26.895]  The EPA says they're going to allow 10 times the level that causes damage, according to this study in the UK.
[00:28:27.836 --> 00:28:32.499]  The question is, how do you even know what level you're getting in the United States?
[00:28:32.619 --> 00:28:36.122]  How do you control the dosage when you just dump it into the water?
[00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:46.949]  If I believed that artificial fluoridation was healthy, if I believed that it was something that I needed for my teeth, I would put it on my teeth.
[00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:51.192]  I wouldn't drink it, but I certainly wouldn't drink it out of the water.
[00:28:51.612 --> 00:28:55.195]  I would take it out of the water so I could control the dosage that I get.
[00:28:56.084 --> 00:29:02.449]  We should always ask, why is the government continuing to add this with all of these questions?
[00:29:02.489 --> 00:29:05.271]  Of course, the scientists pushed back and they said, well, this is just one study.
[00:29:05.572 --> 00:29:06.572]  It's not just one study.
[00:29:06.773 --> 00:29:12.978]  There's been multiple studies on multiple effects and they continue to dump it in the water where they can't control the dosage.
[00:29:13.658 --> 00:29:24.384]  That tells us there's an even more sinister agenda here than just making money for the companies, the industries that want to get rid of their toxic waste, not have to pay to dispose of it.
[00:29:24.644 --> 00:29:28.245]  The aluminum industry, the nuclear processing industry.
[00:29:28.626 --> 00:29:30.547]  These are the industries that push for fluoridation.
[00:29:30.847 --> 00:29:36.770]  They're the ones who benefit from it because they don't have to pay for it to be disposed of as a toxic waste.
[00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:40.752]  They can actually sell it to municipalities and dump it in our water.
[00:29:41.172 --> 00:29:47.313]  And of course, it makes us dumber, it makes us fatter, it gives us ADHD, it gives us depression.
[00:29:48.394 --> 00:29:49.374]  All side benefits.
[00:29:49.734 --> 00:29:51.054]  And it makes us poor.
[00:29:51.414 --> 00:29:52.515]  Stay with us right after the break.
[00:29:52.995 --> 00:29:55.215]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us with more news.
[00:29:55.635 --> 00:29:55.936]  Stay with us.
[00:29:55.956 --> 00:29:56.536]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:59.656 --> 00:30:00.557]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.037 --> 00:30:02.637]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.577 --> 00:30:06.258]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.396 --> 00:30:11.617]  Another major health threat.
[00:30:11.637 --> 00:30:16.559]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:30:16.619 --> 00:30:19.260]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:26.062]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:30:26.343 --> 00:30:29.204]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:30:29.344 --> 00:30:32.265]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:30:32.285 --> 00:30:34.266]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:30:34.306 --> 00:30:37.127]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:30:37.227 --> 00:30:42.729]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:30:42.949 --> 00:30:46.431]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.

[00:31:43.895 --> 00:31:47.857]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:31:48.177 --> 00:31:49.618]  Can you put two and two together?

[00:33:11.617 --> 00:33:16.680]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.301]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.041]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.081 --> 00:33:26.922]  It is Wednesday, March 11, 2015.
[00:33:27.442 --> 00:33:33.285]  I'm David Knight in the InfoWars News Center here in Austin, and joining us from the road is Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.385 --> 00:33:34.046]  He'll be hosting.
[00:33:34.506 --> 00:33:34.906]  Go ahead, Alex.
[00:33:35.487 --> 00:33:38.869]  David Knight, thank you so much for doing a great job in the first half of the hour.
[00:33:38.889 --> 00:33:42.110]  Obviously, I was here ready to go, but I'd just like to mix the show up somewhat.
[00:33:42.131 --> 00:33:47.634]  I'm on the road and let David get rolling with some of those special reports in this unique brand of
[00:33:48.334 --> 00:33:59.838]  piercing analysis and David will be back with us popping in throughout the next few hours and then he will host with some guests and calls in the third hour.
[00:33:59.938 --> 00:34:06.120]  I will drive back to Austin tomorrow and we'll host live in studio Friday and on next Sunday's broadcast.
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:10.281]  This is our little abbreviated working spring break down here on the rainy coast.
[00:34:10.621 --> 00:34:12.102]  My son and daughters love to go
[00:34:12.802 --> 00:34:24.194]  Fishing and deep-sea fishing so they're off with the grandparents doing that right now while we're here working From the hotel room again Alex Jones coming to you from the Texas coastline
[00:34:25.646 --> 00:34:44.351]  Yesterday, we had a pretty powerful three-hour broadcast, and when David and I are both in there jousting to get as much info out, it's not competition, but it creates an energetic synergy that is extremely listenable and mixed in with all the facts and factoids and important info.
[00:34:44.951 --> 00:34:50.653]  But last night, as I was going to bed at about 10 o'clock, I was just laying there thinking
[00:34:51.841 --> 00:35:00.428]  about how historical a time we're in and how epic a time we're in, again to use that word, and how the public really is in a trance.
[00:35:01.969 --> 00:35:09.434]  And just sitting there contemplating, I prayed to God that these are the times you pray.
[00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:11.856]  There are no atheists in foxholes, it's been said.
[00:35:11.876 --> 00:35:13.657]  I forget who said that, we should look up that quote.
[00:35:14.338 --> 00:35:20.522]  And I was thinking, yes, it's good that I rant and rave and scream and yell and hyperventilate, that's real.
[00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:23.452]  I'm like a caged animal desperately trying to get out.
[00:35:23.472 --> 00:35:25.453]  I mean, I know the globalists are closing in on us.
[00:35:25.513 --> 00:35:26.353]  I know they're hurting us.
[00:35:26.913 --> 00:35:31.375]  There's so many good people on this planet I want to protect because I want to be protected as well.
[00:35:31.755 --> 00:35:32.715]  It's mutual aid.
[00:35:33.616 --> 00:35:34.996]  And it's good that I get excited.
[00:35:35.036 --> 00:35:46.221]  So that's what's brought the big crowds of people because the world is under a trance, under a conditioned incremental trance to have learned helplessness and to basically
[00:35:50.498 --> 00:36:01.526]  Have a normalcy bias to where you're an Aztec a thousand years ago and you think it's normal to have your children hauled off to have their hearts cut out for the sun god, for the snake god.
[00:36:02.667 --> 00:36:13.195]  Or you're living in Nazi Germany and you think it's normal that 15 million Germans have died and there's still a year left of the war and you're working 20 hours a day and down the road there's a forced labor camp.
[00:36:14.476 --> 00:36:17.779]  And your cousin just got disappeared because he said Hitler was evil.
[00:36:19.585 --> 00:36:42.931]  Or it's normal, 200 years ago you lived in England, to basically be 12 years old, playing in your front yard, and men pull up in a carriage, knock you on the back of the head, tie you up, and an hour later you're thrown on a ship that takes off on a three-year tour to the Pacific Ocean, and you are literally a slave on board that ship.
[00:36:43.251 --> 00:36:46.632]  Press games, legal and lawful, until they were abolished.
[00:36:47.645 --> 00:36:51.168]  And as that was being abolished, England then abolished slavery itself.
[00:36:52.429 --> 00:37:04.541]  But that's just an example of how evils can seem completely normal, and the first people that stand up to it and say it's wrong can be laughed at and ridiculed, but then overnight folks can turn against it.
[00:37:06.081 --> 00:37:13.002]  Airships, like the Hindenburg, up until the early thirties were in all the major skies of Europe and the United States.
[00:37:13.062 --> 00:37:15.203]  People were traveling on them across the country.
[00:37:16.083 --> 00:37:28.246]  Thousands were being built, hundreds were in service, large ones, when the Hindenburg struck that pole and static electricity exploded because it was using hydrogen, not helium, and burned.
[00:37:29.246 --> 00:37:30.346]  You say, well, why does that matter?
[00:37:30.966 --> 00:37:34.367]  Overnight, blimps fell out of airships
[00:37:36.633 --> 00:37:39.657]  Derigibles fell out of favor.
[00:37:40.938 --> 00:37:44.863]  Just like GMO was the biggest thing 20 years ago, now it's falling out of favor.
[00:37:45.143 --> 00:37:46.885]  They're taking it out of foods across the board.
[00:37:46.945 --> 00:37:49.228]  McDonald's is buckling, saying they're going to take it out.
[00:37:49.949 --> 00:37:52.371]  Huge victories are happening on a daily basis.
[00:37:52.391 --> 00:37:54.714]  So I want you to understand, as dark as it is,
[00:37:55.609 --> 00:37:57.531]  Things can flip very quickly.
[00:37:57.831 --> 00:37:59.032]  We flipped into tyranny.
[00:37:59.352 --> 00:38:02.695]  Now they admit that there's hidden tech basically in everything, spying and listening to us.
[00:38:03.096 --> 00:38:06.659]  We can turn against that, start demanding it be removed, start lawsuits.
[00:38:06.759 --> 00:38:08.160]  It can be removed.
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:13.685]  But we first had to admit it was going on and be called crazy people 20 years ago.
[00:38:14.325 --> 00:38:17.348]  Listen, there was spy tech in the cable boxes and phones 20 years ago.
[00:38:17.408 --> 00:38:18.329]  It's all declassified.
[00:38:19.551 --> 00:38:23.594]  There were babies being grown in cow uteruses 20 years ago.
[00:38:24.215 --> 00:38:33.962]  And I would read mainstream scientific papers on air, but people didn't, general public, just listening to me on the radio said, you're crazy, it doesn't exist.
[00:38:34.523 --> 00:38:37.205]  Just like 20 years ago, we talk about spider goats.
[00:38:37.285 --> 00:38:38.306]  I use that as an example.
[00:38:38.366 --> 00:38:39.627]  Everybody knows about spider goats now.
[00:38:39.867 --> 00:38:42.049]  Part spider, part goat, produce body armor in their milk.
[00:38:43.638 --> 00:38:46.479]  I was called a kook for at least a decade, talking about spider guts.
[00:38:47.039 --> 00:38:52.081]  But I knew that as it became mainline, people would then remember and go, oh, that guy wasn't a kook.
[00:38:52.241 --> 00:38:54.522]  So that's the bottom line.
[00:38:56.082 --> 00:39:00.044]  So I prayed last night and I said, God, what is the most important thing we can do?
[00:39:02.685 --> 00:39:05.966]  And when I woke up this morning, I mean, it was laid heavily upon me.
[00:39:05.986 --> 00:39:08.247]  And I don't usually get like this, but I privately pray.
[00:39:08.287 --> 00:39:12.048]  I don't talk a lot about my private relationship with Christ a lot, but it's very real.
[00:39:12.981 --> 00:39:17.605]  And God said, I already told you, and you said it yesterday, it's break the trance.
[00:39:18.966 --> 00:39:23.991]  And you do that by praying that God give us all guidance and open up our hearts and minds.
[00:39:24.311 --> 00:39:25.172]  You have free will.
[00:39:25.652 --> 00:39:29.576]  The people have chosen to believe a lie, and they've gone along with lies so much.
[00:39:30.056 --> 00:39:35.001]  Abortion, the NSA, the tyranny, but obviously it's just thousands of data points coming down.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:39.943]  They need to be challenged to say, okay, you want to be slaves?
[00:39:40.003 --> 00:39:40.583]  It's all here.
[00:39:40.663 --> 00:39:41.524]  You've had your choice.
[00:39:41.844 --> 00:39:42.965]  Now it's going to get much worse.
[00:39:43.506 --> 00:39:45.567]  And, and, and, and that's what the message is about.
[00:39:46.408 --> 00:39:49.130]  God laid on my heart is people all know the truth.
[00:39:50.091 --> 00:39:51.672]  They've just chosen to not believe it.
[00:39:51.993 --> 00:39:59.198]  A lot of people are choosing to now investigate for themselves and discover that it's much worse than I've said, because you cannot tell somebody about the matrix.
[00:39:59.299 --> 00:39:59.999]  You got to see it.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.121]  You got to see it for yourself.
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:07.944]  And that's what it comes down to is we need to really figure out how to break people out of their trance.
[00:40:08.685 --> 00:40:11.628]  And the biggest way to do that is to cry out to God.
[00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:20.196]  And then God will begin to basically give you by increments discernment.
[00:40:20.777 --> 00:40:23.960]  And the more you act on that discernment, the more discernment God will give you.
[00:40:24.981 --> 00:40:26.862]  But people choose to be ignorant.
[00:40:26.943 --> 00:40:28.184]  They choose to not understand.
[00:40:29.636 --> 00:40:31.417]  They'd say to Christ, why do you speak in parables?
[00:40:31.437 --> 00:40:33.238]  He wasn't speaking in parables, really.
[00:40:34.258 --> 00:40:36.940]  They just couldn't understand it because they were the profane.
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:43.923]  They had chosen lies so much throughout their lives that that was their universe.
[00:40:44.223 --> 00:40:50.847]  So to hear the truth was a lie to them because it would destroy the fraudulent world they lived in.
[00:40:53.294 --> 00:40:57.216]  And we can't be mad at these people that are in willful denial and under mind control.
[00:40:57.496 --> 00:41:07.761]  These are very sad victims that are the equivalent of little baby elephants that have been attacked by a pack of wild hyenas being drug away with their little snouts being torn off.
[00:41:08.321 --> 00:41:11.342]  I mean, spiritually, they're just being torn apart by a bunch of sharks.
[00:41:12.022 --> 00:41:17.365]  They have this smile of mind control in their eyes, enjoying their destruction, enjoying their failure.
[00:41:18.982 --> 00:41:33.638]  But as we press with our will that God's given us, as we press on them and as all this evil begins to manifest that was right below the surface, and as the evil intensifies, we're going to be attacked, and that is an incredible blessing.
[00:41:34.779 --> 00:41:36.441]  That is a sign of incredible victory.
[00:41:37.714 --> 00:41:46.159]  I want to get into, just because Rob Dewey did a report on it, and it's back in the news now, that Google is growing aborted baby parts.
[00:41:47.599 --> 00:41:54.043]  They harvest them, the little darlings, and then they grow them in rats, in pigs, and in cows.
[00:41:54.883 --> 00:41:59.206]  Now, this is what Google's telling the public today, and I have the mainstream news articles about how great it is.
[00:41:59.986 --> 00:42:03.709]  They just report on it like it's no big deal, like the president was barbecuing children on the front lawn.
[00:42:04.169 --> 00:42:08.472]  Oh, that'd be the biggest scandal ever, but see, oh, it's just dead babies, so it's no big deal.
[00:42:08.792 --> 00:42:10.393]  Humans turned into a total commodity.
[00:42:11.674 --> 00:42:16.097]  Five years ago, people couldn't believe that Pepsi used baby parts for their flavor testing.
[00:42:17.698 --> 00:42:19.900]  But of course, now it's all over the news, and oh, no big deal.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.221]  What's wrong with baby parts?
[00:42:23.419 --> 00:42:24.680]  Same thing, you know, here.
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.482]  I want to explain something to you.
[00:42:26.582 --> 00:42:41.694]  It was in scientific papers that the BBC mentioned in 1996 that I read, and they were talking about how great it was, about how in government labs they were growing fetuses that they had basically
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.841]  You hear about all this?
[00:43:03.277 --> 00:43:13.741]  Human cloning, when they admitted it was going on in 1997, they declassified in England that the government had been cloning embryos for at least 25 years before that.
[00:43:14.321 --> 00:43:16.762]  So now we're back into the 70s.
[00:43:18.583 --> 00:43:22.004]  And then of course you learn it was going on even before that, back into the 50s.
[00:43:22.424 --> 00:43:29.527]  And now they're declassifying Nuremberg documents, you can look these up, where they were already cloning rabbits in the 40s in Nazi Germany.
[00:43:30.865 --> 00:43:38.229]  So see, the reason the elite are so arrogant is, folks, everything you've heard from me is what we can prove and folks can't handle it.
[00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:44.252]  Let me tell you, I can extrapolate out where all this goes and see the predictive programming.
[00:43:44.812 --> 00:43:47.313]  We are in deep trouble.
[00:43:49.695 --> 00:43:52.176]  We are beyond a science fiction movie.
[00:43:52.256 --> 00:43:52.836]  It's real.
[00:43:54.497 --> 00:43:56.158]  And if you're in a trance, you don't understand that.
[00:43:56.398 --> 00:44:00.000]  But if you're conscious, it's incredible what's going on.
[00:44:03.797 --> 00:44:04.557]  God let it on me.
[00:44:04.857 --> 00:44:06.258]  I want the crew to work with me on this.
[00:44:06.818 --> 00:44:08.298]  But I need to speak more.
[00:44:08.578 --> 00:44:09.719]  I need to get angry sometimes.
[00:44:10.499 --> 00:44:12.079]  But I need to be more poignant.
[00:44:12.559 --> 00:44:13.940]  And I need to talk slower.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.881]  And I need to really give people time for this to sink in.
[00:44:18.201 --> 00:44:19.101]  To break the trance.
[00:44:20.301 --> 00:44:23.102]  We've already woken up the people that weren't really in a trance.
[00:44:23.142 --> 00:44:24.042]  Knew something was wrong.
[00:44:24.382 --> 00:44:26.063]  Heard some guy yelling and came and listened.
[00:44:27.267 --> 00:44:30.228]  And they already knew the truths that I was speaking that were already in their heart.
[00:44:30.308 --> 00:44:31.068]  I didn't tell you anything.
[00:44:31.448 --> 00:44:36.310]  We need to reach out to people that are in the trance and not be manipulative.
[00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:43.672]  Not do a fake version of it, but a real version of it, of the way you speak to a child when they won't listen and keep going in the street.
[00:44:43.712 --> 00:44:48.394]  You get them out of the arm and you go, listen, I saw a little boy run over once.
[00:44:49.394 --> 00:44:52.037]  And he was smashed all over the road like that dead deer.
[00:44:52.057 --> 00:44:57.403]  And if you go back out in the streets, you might end up getting run over and your guts are going to be all over the street.
[00:44:57.423 --> 00:45:06.733]  An old guy named Mr. Bruner, who actually sold my parents the house that we had there on San Fernando Way in Dallas when I was about five years old.
[00:45:06.994 --> 00:45:09.596]  My mom was asleep inside on a Saturday and almost got hit by a car.
[00:45:11.141 --> 00:45:15.643]  He told me before I got out of the street and he came over and he grabbed me by the arm and he reached down and he told me just exactly that.
[00:45:15.663 --> 00:45:20.404]  He didn't say it hatefully but he had a little bit of menace in his voice because the cars are a menace.
[00:45:23.185 --> 00:45:25.946]  Kind of like don't stick your hand down that rattlesnake hole, boy.
[00:45:27.506 --> 00:45:33.288]  And that's how we need to speak to people, at least some of the time, to break them out of their trance.
[00:45:33.488 --> 00:45:37.569]  Do you understand that the British government and the U.S.
[00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:46.011]  government and the Harvard and all of them admit the fluoride's making us depressed and fat and suicidal and making our thyroids and pancreases go out?
[00:45:46.391 --> 00:45:47.071]  They know it.
[00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:48.452]  They did it on purpose.
[00:45:48.852 --> 00:45:49.952]  Now deal with it.
[00:45:54.113 --> 00:45:54.653]  Think about that.
[00:45:55.394 --> 00:45:56.514]  Think about Google.
[00:45:57.895 --> 00:45:58.716]  Think about Google.
[00:46:00.558 --> 00:46:08.507]  Openly coming out eight years ago and saying we're going to use microphones and cameras to watch and listen to you, but don't worry, it's computers keylogging everything you say.
[00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:12.712]  Now it's all out in the open being done.
[00:46:12.832 --> 00:46:13.733]  Think about their arrogance.
[00:46:13.753 --> 00:46:15.034]  Think about what they haven't announced yet.
[00:46:19.676 --> 00:46:22.078]  Now I have some Second Amendment news coming up in the next hour.
[00:46:22.118 --> 00:46:23.780]  They claim the ATF has backed off.
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:24.760]  I read their statement.
[00:46:25.661 --> 00:46:27.623]  This is a... ...fint.
[00:46:28.163 --> 00:46:31.606]  This is where you act like you're going one way in a sword fight, but you're really going the other way.
[00:46:32.007 --> 00:46:35.049]  Or when you act like you're gonna pass the ball and it's really a handoff.
[00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:38.512]  Or you act like you handed it off to somebody and you really handed it off to somebody else.
[00:46:38.873 --> 00:46:43.897]  It's a trick, as guaranteed headlines are, that they've been defeated, they've backed off.
[00:46:43.917 --> 00:46:46.399]  You read what they say, they say we're shelving it for now.
[00:46:46.799 --> 00:46:47.240]  No, they're not.
[00:46:48.527 --> 00:46:52.351]  The attack pattern... Well, I'll get into the attack pattern.
[00:46:53.251 --> 00:46:54.553]  I'll cover that in the next hour.
[00:46:55.453 --> 00:46:57.936]  But it's very easy to understand the enemy's playbook.
[00:46:59.477 --> 00:47:00.718]  They have a big operation to run.
[00:47:00.758 --> 00:47:04.922]  That's one of their weaknesses, is that they have playbooks because they've got legions of operatives.
[00:47:05.162 --> 00:47:06.324]  So they run plays.
[00:47:07.084 --> 00:47:08.646]  Just like a football coach, okay?
[00:47:08.666 --> 00:47:11.248]  And if you just study their plays, we've got their stinking playbooks.
[00:47:11.468 --> 00:47:13.971]  They've all written books to command their forces.
[00:47:15.273 --> 00:47:15.953]  Ecoscience.
[00:47:15.973 --> 00:47:16.733]  There's hundreds of them.
[00:47:17.493 --> 00:47:19.834]  I've read close to a hundred of their manuals.
[00:47:20.314 --> 00:47:21.634]  It's unbelievably sickening.
[00:47:22.214 --> 00:47:23.275]  You can go read their manuals.
[00:47:23.295 --> 00:47:24.415]  You can read their playbooks.
[00:47:25.015 --> 00:47:28.896]  If you decide there's a war going on, there's a game for your destiny going on.
[00:47:29.136 --> 00:47:30.656]  It is going on, whether you admit it or not.
[00:47:31.316 --> 00:47:32.917]  And then we've got the enemy playbooks.
[00:47:32.957 --> 00:47:34.477]  I mean, these are the enemy generals.
[00:47:34.777 --> 00:47:36.077]  The, the Feral Marshals.
[00:47:38.278 --> 00:47:39.978]  The Witch Kings of the New World Order.
[00:47:40.018 --> 00:47:42.119]  We have their operational manuals.
[00:47:42.179 --> 00:47:42.679]  We know.
[00:47:44.465 --> 00:47:49.627]  You've just got to have the strength to admit it and get past the spiritual deception that won't let you even see it.
[00:47:50.287 --> 00:47:53.328]  The trance that the magicians have put us under.
[00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:59.310]  But all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.
[00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:06.092]  You take the blue pill, you go back and never remember any of this again.
[00:48:07.373 --> 00:48:11.554]  Take the red pill, you go down the rabbit hole and I'll show you how far it goes.
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:18.283]  But warning, all God is offering all of us is the truth, nothing more.
[00:48:21.566 --> 00:48:22.367]  But you have to decide.
[00:48:23.187 --> 00:48:29.612]  Now that said, I want to get into the dehumanization of the babies.
[00:48:30.313 --> 00:48:33.556]  And look, women that are into abortion, and it's your sacrament, I understand.
[00:48:34.096 --> 00:48:39.540]  At least you should know that babies are being harvested for upwards of $50,000.
[00:48:41.676 --> 00:48:43.517]  Especially if they have certain genetic types.
[00:48:44.297 --> 00:48:52.139]  Now, a lot of the places are just, you know, butcher shops, but a lot of the fancier ones that you hoity-toity women go to, you should at least get a little cash.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:49:05.424]  That's a way to shut this down, is to actually let folks know how valuable the market is in the next generation, as if there'll be any future generations when the elite have been able to sell something like this.
[00:49:07.046 --> 00:49:07.987]  So that's coming up.
[00:49:09.287 --> 00:49:14.831]  There's so much of this now happening that I can't even watch it all or cover it all.
[00:49:16.592 --> 00:49:18.633]  Listeners continue to tell us about it on a daily basis.
[00:49:20.034 --> 00:49:29.179]  Everything from The Simpsons to Comedy Central to major Hollywood movies like Prisoners to
[00:49:30.874 --> 00:49:33.556]  New Stuff Every Week, a new movie by David Cross.
[00:49:35.018 --> 00:49:39.441]  Has a Ku Klux Klan basic leader who says he learned it all from Alex Jones on the radio.
[00:49:40.983 --> 00:49:42.063]  And starts screaming the N-word.
[00:49:42.083 --> 00:49:50.390]  I mean, and people that don't know me are just going to go into movie theaters and it's like, I love Alex Jones, you know, Heil Hitler, kill all the Jews, N-word, N-word.
[00:49:51.692 --> 00:49:54.894]  I mean, this is the guy from Mr. Show and all the rest of it.
[00:49:56.095 --> 00:49:57.877]  Who, by the way, I mean, I like Mr. Show.
[00:49:59.633 --> 00:50:02.295]  Portlandia, you name it, but I mean these are sick people.
[00:50:03.897 --> 00:50:17.508]  Anyone who, and they're showing, and I'll bet money, like Armstrong Williams got caught being paid a quarter mil to lie and say he was for No Child Left Behind to get conservatives on board for federalization of education.
[00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:27.537]  Montel Williams came out and said that I am a cokehead who wants to blow things up and, I mean you can go read the quotes, I mean it is
[00:50:28.453 --> 00:50:28.854]  Unbelievable.
[00:50:28.894 --> 00:50:32.821]  Montel Williams is one of the only watchable talk show hosts of that whole genre.
[00:50:32.841 --> 00:50:34.043]  I know nothing against Montel Williams.
[00:50:34.805 --> 00:50:37.149]  Except now I know he is Judas Iscariot.
[00:50:38.038 --> 00:50:41.320]  I mean, this guy would sell his mother out, in my opinion, for a stick of bubblegum.
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:45.681]  I mean, the stuff he says about me, hands down, I could win a libel suit.
[00:50:46.402 --> 00:50:47.622]  I could win a defamation suit.
[00:50:48.163 --> 00:50:48.983]  Just hands down.
[00:50:49.483 --> 00:50:50.184]  I mean, done.
[00:50:51.164 --> 00:50:53.725]  But MSNBC says that I'm behind the Boston bombing.
[00:50:53.745 --> 00:50:56.266]  We can play that clip, no proof, when they say that.
[00:50:56.947 --> 00:50:57.367]  And you know what?
[00:50:57.467 --> 00:50:59.768]  I just accept all these lies and attacks, okay?
[00:51:01.061 --> 00:51:03.862]  I mean, I'm here trying to fight, and I know why it is.
[00:51:03.962 --> 00:51:09.004]  I'm speaking out against the fake president, the God, and so the word's gone out.
[00:51:10.345 --> 00:51:12.966]  Suddenly, it's like the gates of Hades were opened.
[00:51:13.086 --> 00:51:16.928]  I would like to present to you their greenhouses that double as emergency shelters.
[00:51:17.208 --> 00:51:19.088]  Their greenhouses simply snap together.
[00:51:19.208 --> 00:51:19.989]  No tools needed.
[00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:22.530]  As a greenhouse, it will stand for decades.
[00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:27.372]  It's incredibly strong, long-lasting, and it can be quickly put up or taken down.
[00:51:27.632 --> 00:51:30.113]  It is also ideal when used as an emergency shelter.
[00:51:30.553 --> 00:51:37.228]  Learn more about this great greenhouse and the money you can save over the big box store prices at HarvestRight.com.

[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:41.361]  Hey, Boomer!
[00:51:41.601 --> 00:51:44.942]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[00:51:45.042 --> 00:51:46.622]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[00:51:46.723 --> 00:51:48.483]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:51:48.663 --> 00:51:54.165]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:51:54.505 --> 00:51:55.246]  I know, right?
[00:51:55.346 --> 00:51:56.306]  You love it, too!
[00:51:56.666 --> 00:51:57.967]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[00:51:58.087 --> 00:51:59.007]  Let's go get some!
[00:51:59.127 --> 00:52:00.808]  Get Berkey Clean Water by calling 877-886-3653.

[00:52:09.574 --> 00:52:12.136]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:12.397 --> 00:52:17.261]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:17.521 --> 00:52:25.408]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:25.648 --> 00:52:29.952]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:30.173 --> 00:52:33.976]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:34.136 --> 00:52:39.838]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:40.078 --> 00:52:42.858]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:43.239 --> 00:52:48.460]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:56.722]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:08.615]  BuyPatriotsSupply.com slash Alex.
[00:53:09.116 --> 00:53:09.776]  I'm Mike Huckabee.
[00:53:09.916 --> 00:53:14.218]  I was the governor of Arkansas and ran for president in 2008, and I used to be a diabetic.
[00:53:14.338 --> 00:53:19.800]  One of the coolest campaigns I ever took on and won was the crusade that reversed my type 2 diabetes naturally.
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:24.843]  I was able to get off the medications I'd taken, and I lost 110 pounds of fat in the process.
[00:53:25.043 --> 00:53:31.525]  If you or someone you care about has type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, I urge you to pay close attention to what I'm about to tell you.
[00:53:31.685 --> 00:53:38.048]  The same methods I used to reverse my type 2 diabetes are found today in the Diabetes Solution Kit from Barton Publishing.
[00:53:38.208 --> 00:53:43.892]  It's an all-natural plan that really could work for you in reversing type 2 diabetes and prevent it from coming back.

[00:54:20.222 --> 00:54:35.171]  Any government officials and corporate officials publicly admit that they take neuro-linguistic programming, they admit that they go and take Delphi technique courses, they take courses on... I mean, you wonder why you tune into NPR and everybody talks with this voice like this?
[00:54:35.732 --> 00:54:40.755]  Because that's a soothing voice that will put people, if you listen for just a few minutes, into a very calm state.
[00:54:41.335 --> 00:54:48.200]  You take a public already watching television, you know, five or ten hours a day, in a trance state, with lowered brainwaves, that's in all the big studies,
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.281]  You're speaking to someone in a trance.
[00:54:51.301 --> 00:54:53.902]  If you try to talk to somebody loud while they're asleep, they'll wake up.
[00:54:54.342 --> 00:54:54.962]  That's what we've done.
[00:54:55.522 --> 00:55:00.304]  But if you talk to them when they're asleep very softly, you can sometimes get people to actually sleepwalk.
[00:55:00.804 --> 00:55:02.145]  Well, that's just an example.
[00:55:02.985 --> 00:55:08.187]  So it's good to yell at folks and get them out of a burning house if they won't wake up, or throw a cold bucket of water on them.
[00:55:08.647 --> 00:55:11.208]  But the tactic of also slowing down
[00:55:12.108 --> 00:55:26.814]  Calming down, I'm telling myself this right now, and really saying, is it normal to take the dead babies, harvest their organs while they're still alive, implant them in other animals to grow them up larger?
[00:55:27.294 --> 00:55:31.596]  Genetically engineered cows that are part human so that they don't reject the babies.
[00:55:32.016 --> 00:55:32.917]  I forgot that part.
[00:55:34.113 --> 00:55:43.602]  Or just growing babies up in test tubes and implanting them in cows and pigs and dogs and sheep and rats and growing them up.
[00:55:45.404 --> 00:55:49.508]  And see, before you go, oh, that's crazy, I've got mainstream news here I'm going to cover next hour.
[00:55:49.828 --> 00:55:50.729]  We just played a report.
[00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:53.072]  This is Google's life extension program.
[00:55:53.692 --> 00:55:58.357]  They're just rolling it out as a platform for all these under-the-surface government developments.
[00:55:59.775 --> 00:56:14.101]  Meanwhile, Montel Williams official Twitter, when we put out an article, Mikel Thelen, we have the whole Twitter history here, Twitter trail, VA manager jokes about veteran suicides.
[00:56:15.302 --> 00:56:17.563]  Indystar.com forward slash story.
[00:56:17.583 --> 00:56:19.604]  I mean, we just sent out the Indianapolis Star.
[00:56:20.629 --> 00:56:27.073]  We've done our own reports, had VA whistleblowers about joking about how, you know, they deny him care and how much they hate him.
[00:56:27.373 --> 00:56:28.734]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[00:56:28.814 --> 00:56:29.674]  We tweet that.
[00:56:30.395 --> 00:56:39.760]  And Montel Williams responds, saying, oh, conspiracy theorist, tinfoil hats have been more right than wrong.
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:40.440]  I support.
[00:56:41.961 --> 00:56:42.762]  Montel Williams.
[00:56:44.422 --> 00:56:46.264]  Let's add the conspiracy theorist in.
[00:56:47.084 --> 00:56:48.245]  And then he goes in to say,
[00:56:49.315 --> 00:56:52.819]  That Alex Jones and Joe Big should use less cocaine.
[00:56:53.519 --> 00:57:02.449]  He goes on to say that... He goes on to say Alex Jones is an evil master con artist who should burn in hell.
[00:57:05.632 --> 00:57:09.296]  And he goes on to say that, you know, that I'm somebody who wants to get some people to blow stuff up.
[00:57:11.186 --> 00:57:15.529]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have publicly said that in high school I've used cocaine twice and absolutely hated it.
[00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:18.572]  I don't use any illegal drugs.
[00:57:20.113 --> 00:57:24.096]  But see, for someone like Montel Williams to see this amount of energy is weird to him.
[00:57:24.616 --> 00:57:27.698]  Hey Montel, if somebody punches me in the nose, you're going to see a lot of energy too.
[00:57:28.819 --> 00:57:32.902]  I am a redneck, hillbilly, fiery-blooded free human being.
[00:57:33.423 --> 00:57:36.025]  And I see a lot of black people out there too that don't want to be slaves.
[00:57:36.045 --> 00:57:38.727]  So I don't know what your problem is, buddy, but this isn't cocaine.
[00:57:39.963 --> 00:57:42.844]  I'm powered by human survival and the spirit of Jesus Christ.
[00:57:43.144 --> 00:57:43.805]  You know what that is?
[00:57:44.825 --> 00:57:50.568]  I am not gonna lie down in the ditch and suck boots all day while they're killing veterans and putting them on secret list.
[00:57:51.168 --> 00:57:53.829]  And the only reason I get angry is because I'm still alive.
[00:57:54.289 --> 00:57:59.351]  And people that are dead inside like you have got a problem with people like me and you think it's a joke.
[00:58:00.912 --> 00:58:02.933]  The spirit I got in me started this country.
[00:58:03.753 --> 00:58:04.674]  It started Texas.
[00:58:06.141 --> 00:58:11.622]  And I just can't believe that people like you are so dead inside that you look at somebody like me and call me a con artist.
[00:58:13.123 --> 00:58:14.463]  Because that's all you got.
[00:58:14.523 --> 00:58:15.743]  You don't have any facts.
[00:58:15.783 --> 00:58:16.764]  You don't bring anything.
[00:58:17.064 --> 00:58:25.066]  We tweet out somebody else's article, mainstream news, doing the right thing, reporting on how there's a pattern of them.
[00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:29.712]  Pushing veterans into suicide, you name it, and you sit there and call us names.
[00:58:29.732 --> 00:58:30.372]  Well, you know what?
[00:58:30.832 --> 00:58:32.693]  We stand on the facts, and that's the end of it.
[00:58:32.974 --> 00:58:47.101]  And now they have a movie out, being promoted by Comedy Central, HBO, uh, people are involved, where they totally have someone saying, I love Alex Jones, in word, you know, just everything else.
[00:58:47.802 --> 00:58:48.442]  Stay with us.
[00:58:48.482 --> 00:58:48.882]  Come back.

[01:00:16.365 --> 01:00:20.530]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.991]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.772 --> 01:00:23.673]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:24.334 --> 01:00:27.958]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.518 --> 01:00:32.583]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.925 --> 01:00:49.932]  Oh by the grace of God we're here live broadcasting worldwide on a daily basis now national Hollywood level and TV level platforms go with the talking point that we're lying racist drug heads here at InfoWars.com
[01:00:52.128 --> 01:00:57.151]  And, uh, you know, Joe Biggs could sue Montel Williams for claiming that he and I are on cocaine.
[01:00:57.591 --> 01:00:58.051]  I know Joe.
[01:00:58.091 --> 01:00:58.952]  He doesn't use drugs.
[01:00:58.992 --> 01:00:59.752]  He does drink beer.
[01:00:59.952 --> 01:01:00.693]  I've had a few with him.
[01:01:00.713 --> 01:01:01.913]  And he does eat steaks.
[01:01:01.933 --> 01:01:04.755]  He's been over to my house and had steak, you know, with me and my family.
[01:01:05.815 --> 01:01:09.978]  But, uh, you know, that's Montel Williams attacking a veteran, a combat veteran like Joe Biggs.
[01:01:10.798 --> 01:01:22.989]  Because he tweeted out Mikael Thelen, one of our team members, who just simply put out... I mean, Montel Williams, the angle on this is Montel Williams tries to cover up people attacking veterans.
[01:01:23.049 --> 01:01:25.391]  I mean, it's sick.
[01:01:26.151 --> 01:01:26.532]  It's sick.
[01:01:27.533 --> 01:01:34.138]  And if you just joined us, Montel Williams came out and with just defamation, slander, just incredible lies.
[01:01:34.158 --> 01:01:37.802]  I would like to invite Montel Williams to come on the show.
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:43.124]  And to, you know, show some proof here of all these horrible things he has to say about me.
[01:01:43.785 --> 01:01:45.207]  But again, why is this happening?
[01:01:45.307 --> 01:01:45.927]  Will you tune in?
[01:01:45.967 --> 01:01:47.129]  We're battling for the Second Amendment.
[01:01:47.729 --> 01:01:49.030]  We're battling for family rights.
[01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:55.477]  We're battling that babies not be kept alive when you think they're aborted and then used in medical experiments.
[01:01:55.537 --> 01:01:56.538]  I mean, that's in the news.
[01:01:57.719 --> 01:02:01.523]  Or that babies be cut up and then their body parts live after they've been harvested.
[01:02:02.564 --> 01:02:06.006]  Implanted in different mammals that have been hybridized with humans.
[01:02:08.387 --> 01:02:15.130]  They've now got a herd, last time I checked, of more than 10,000 cows in China that aren't for implanting humans.
[01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:16.091]  They've got those as well.
[01:02:16.131 --> 01:02:17.271]  China's the main base of this.
[01:02:17.952 --> 01:02:19.492]  Costa Rica, strangely enough, does as well.
[01:02:20.313 --> 01:02:26.896]  But they actually implant the human genetics into the udders so human breast milk comes out.
[01:02:28.015 --> 01:02:30.961]  Those cows are part human, like the spider goats are part arachnid.
[01:02:31.823 --> 01:02:36.672]  I mean, we're here covering the epic craziness, not liberal, not conservative, free will.
[01:02:40.134 --> 01:02:41.955]  That you're allowed to control your own destiny.
[01:02:42.135 --> 01:02:45.917]  All races of people are one race coming together in love and liberty.
[01:02:46.718 --> 01:02:50.760]  And we are attacked like no one else by the Nazis because most of them are government financed.
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:51.980]  I mean, go to any Nazi website.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:54.061]  There are more attacks on us than Benjamin Netanyahu.
[01:02:54.481 --> 01:02:59.384]  And then we're also attacked by the hardcore leftist Jewish lobby because we love everyone.
[01:02:59.764 --> 01:03:00.965]  We're not here for division.
[01:03:01.005 --> 01:03:03.829]  We're not here to manage different gangs or crime groups.
[01:03:04.189 --> 01:03:07.312]  We're here to really try to go to the stars.
[01:03:07.993 --> 01:03:12.618]  And that's why when we come back from break, we have a new attack by David Cross, an amazing comedian.
[01:03:13.874 --> 01:03:22.098]  It's so hurtful for me, being a David Cross fan, watching him on Mr. Show and Portlandia and things over the years, some of the features that I've, you know, watched.
[01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:35.025]  And it is so painful, absolutely painful, to see him, the director and the writer of this film, that we're going to be talking about when we come back on the other side.
[01:03:36.926 --> 01:03:44.033]  To have the star of the film be a crazy person that goes crazy on the internet because of me and runs around screaming the n-word and worshipping Hitler, basically.
[01:03:44.434 --> 01:03:47.316]  And he says I did all this because of Alex Jones, the talk show host.
[01:03:47.377 --> 01:03:50.520]  I mean, that is pure, brazen lies.
[01:03:51.381 --> 01:03:52.622]  Purely an attempt.
[01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:57.527]  There's no way a jury wouldn't rule for me, guaranteed in a lawsuit.
[01:03:58.479 --> 01:03:59.400]  I mean, just unbelievable.
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:05.424]  David Knight, this signifies that we are now over the main enemy target in the Info War.
[01:04:05.564 --> 01:04:08.186]  Praise God, and pass the ammunition in the Info War.
[01:04:08.206 --> 01:04:08.627]  David Knight.
[01:04:09.366 --> 01:04:12.309]  Yeah, Alex, they don't have anything to argue with with the facts.
[01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:15.732]  They're losing on that, so they resort to ad hominem attacks.
[01:04:15.772 --> 01:04:17.394]  They attack the messenger.
[01:04:17.935 --> 01:04:27.724]  They will literally kill the messenger, just like they did with Gary Webb, but if it comes down to that, but they go after you as a person because they don't want to talk about the facts.
[01:04:27.764 --> 01:04:32.909]  I was just tweeted last night, somebody sent me a National Geographic article that was attacking fluoride.
[01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:40.637]  And comparing it to non-scientific attitudes, and they actually had a graph talking about the flat earth.
[01:04:40.697 --> 01:04:49.305]  But before they got to that, Alex, they had a quote from Dr. Strangelove, where they went through this whole thing talking about the fluoride conspiracy and making fun of it.
[01:04:49.745 --> 01:04:57.528]  But then today I walk in and there's a major report from Newsweek linking to yet another study that proves the effect of fluoride.
[01:04:57.548 --> 01:04:59.689]  We're winning on the facts and they can't stand it.
[01:04:59.709 --> 01:05:00.490]  That's because there's a battle.
[01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:02.691]  And everybody in the system is not evil.
[01:05:02.731 --> 01:05:05.232]  There's a real moment of conscience that we've come to.
[01:05:05.292 --> 01:05:05.692]  Stay with us.
[01:05:10.342 --> 01:05:13.865]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:14.005 --> 01:05:17.988]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:18.288 --> 01:05:19.750]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:20.070 --> 01:05:27.656]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:27.936 --> 01:05:28.777]  But for how long?

[01:05:35.722 --> 01:05:36.883]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:05:37.584 --> 01:05:38.525]  Just won't quit.
[01:05:39.861 --> 01:05:43.064]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:05:43.364 --> 01:05:51.370]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:56.635]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:05:57.035 --> 01:05:59.317]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:06:45.053 --> 01:06:48.637]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:06:48.977 --> 01:06:55.282]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:06:55.623 --> 01:07:00.607]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[01:07:19.377 --> 01:07:29.124]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:07:29.304 --> 01:07:32.226]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[01:07:32.346 --> 01:07:32.606]  I think so.
[01:07:55.145 --> 01:08:00.209]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.

[01:08:06.414 --> 01:08:08.436]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:08.516 --> 01:08:13.840]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.632 --> 01:08:22.975]  We're live on this Wednesday, March 11, 2015.
[01:08:23.776 --> 01:08:24.557]  I'm David Knight.
[01:08:24.577 --> 01:08:27.340]  I'm here in the InfoWars news studio in Austin.
[01:08:27.801 --> 01:08:30.524]  And joining us on the road to host is Alex Jones.
[01:08:30.604 --> 01:08:32.967]  Alex, they're coming after you with one attack after the other.
[01:08:33.848 --> 01:08:34.389]  We're winning.
[01:08:34.529 --> 01:08:36.572]  What do you make of this, these personal attacks?
[01:08:38.052 --> 01:08:41.374]  Well, David, you were just mentioning it earlier, then I'll get into this latest attack.
[01:08:41.414 --> 01:08:43.936]  And this show is not idiosyncratic.
[01:08:44.016 --> 01:08:46.338]  It's not all based on us.
[01:08:46.438 --> 01:08:50.540]  It's just that we're a sensor, a probe, like a thermometer stuck in a turkey.
[01:08:51.161 --> 01:08:57.205]  We're at the very tip of the spear, just like the military will put out frontline reconnaissance trips, knowing some of them are expendable.
[01:08:57.545 --> 01:09:02.048]  They're like nerve endings to go out and identify the main enemy force so you don't lose your main force.
[01:09:02.608 --> 01:09:05.090]  And so we have volunteered organically.
[01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:06.471]  It's not just I'm not under attack.
[01:09:06.591 --> 01:09:07.592]  The entire operation is.
[01:09:08.132 --> 01:09:16.944]  Because we're out front, you know, exposing the gun grab, exposing the world government conspiracy, exposing the planetary tyranny, exposing the medical tyranny, exposing the...
[01:09:17.762 --> 01:09:23.283]  The entire spectrum, we're out front as a probe, basically, taking the main fire.
[01:09:23.383 --> 01:09:32.625]  And every day, Comedy Central, Fox Entertainment, new movies, different celebrities say talking points.
[01:09:33.245 --> 01:09:34.625]  Alex Jones is on cocaine.
[01:09:34.705 --> 01:09:36.326]  Alex Jones wears a tinfoil hat.
[01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:39.646]  Alex Jones is racist.
[01:09:40.187 --> 01:09:41.747]  Alex Jones hates black people.
[01:09:42.167 --> 01:09:43.507]  Alex Jones hates Jews.
[01:09:44.227 --> 01:09:45.067]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:09:45.148 --> 01:09:46.248]  Alex Jones is a con artist.
[01:09:46.308 --> 01:09:47.188]  Alex Jones is insane.
[01:09:48.402 --> 01:09:48.622]  It is.
[01:09:49.022 --> 01:09:50.543]  It is in newspapers.
[01:09:50.643 --> 01:09:52.084]  I mean, The Guardian last week.
[01:09:52.364 --> 01:09:58.966]  Every day, without looking, they are attacking us and a talking point has gone out.
[01:09:59.006 --> 01:09:59.927]  In fact, I predict
[01:10:00.822 --> 01:10:06.986]  I predict that if we were able to get the information, if I was to sue David Cross, one of the most famous comedians in the U.S.
[01:10:07.006 --> 01:10:08.447]  today, I've been a fan.
[01:10:08.467 --> 01:10:11.388]  I think his comedy is very, very funny, a lot of a tie-brow.
[01:10:12.069 --> 01:10:16.491]  I predict that his film, Hits, was actually paid product placement money.
[01:10:16.892 --> 01:10:20.774]  That's how you fund most of these films, you know, with Doritos or Budweiser.
[01:10:21.274 --> 01:10:21.715]  I don't know.
[01:10:50.444 --> 01:10:52.445]  To have someone attack the Second Amendment.
[01:10:52.885 --> 01:10:58.768]  They will pay you to have someone say something negative about the Founding Fathers.
[01:10:59.108 --> 01:11:03.731]  That's why you watch any TV show or any movie or any drama, they are running down freedom.
[01:11:04.631 --> 01:11:05.692]  They are attacking liberty.
[01:11:06.072 --> 01:11:07.152]  They are attacking men.
[01:11:07.392 --> 01:11:12.095]  Every show you see, almost every show, the father is a fat lazy slob.
[01:11:13.783 --> 01:11:14.965]  This is an all-out attack.
[01:11:15.005 --> 01:11:27.504]  Well, now on a daily basis, in just the last two days we've learned, after Mikkel Thelen tweeted out a mainstream news article out of the
[01:11:29.434 --> 01:11:38.579]  Major publication was the Pittsburgh Star, the Indianapolis Star, a fire VA manager who sent email mocking vet suicides.
[01:11:38.599 --> 01:11:39.179]  That's them.
[01:11:39.519 --> 01:11:43.121]  We have the email, we know they're making fun of the dead vets, we know they're on death list.
[01:11:43.421 --> 01:11:51.886]  We've had VA whistleblowers on from the East Coast, I'll leave it at that, one of the biggest hospitals, where they openly make fun of them and openly put them on death list.
[01:11:52.626 --> 01:11:54.447]  Before that ever broke in the news last year.
[01:11:54.687 --> 01:11:55.447]  We had that.
[01:11:55.667 --> 01:11:56.207]  Not bragging.
[01:11:56.387 --> 01:11:57.368]  This is why we're under attack.
[01:11:57.408 --> 01:11:59.048]  I mean, we really are reporting on stuff.
[01:11:59.308 --> 01:12:00.909]  We're really standing up for human dignity.
[01:12:01.249 --> 01:12:04.870]  We're really standing up for the veterans and old people and babies.
[01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:07.551]  Because what you do to the least of me, you do to me.
[01:12:08.131 --> 01:12:12.093]  What they do to the weak, they will end up doing to the strong.
[01:12:12.573 --> 01:12:15.254]  The basic instinct is defend the weak or defend your veterans.
[01:12:16.254 --> 01:12:18.075]  It doesn't matter if some of the wars they were in were evil.
[01:12:18.135 --> 01:12:21.578]  You defend the people that had the will to go and believe they were fighting for the people.
[01:12:22.158 --> 01:12:35.908]  But the globalists absolutely hate them, and they hate us, ladies and gentlemen, because we are veterans of the Infowar, and veterans are going up against this scum that is trying to cause a civil war and racial division and a war with the police that everybody's seen.
[01:12:37.551 --> 01:12:38.771]  With George Soros involved.
[01:12:38.811 --> 01:12:40.712]  It's all the same usual suspects.
[01:12:40.752 --> 01:12:42.192]  George Soros and the internet grab.
[01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:43.312]  And the FCC.
[01:12:43.332 --> 01:12:45.093]  George Soros and the open border grab.
[01:12:45.773 --> 01:12:48.514]  George Soros and the attack the police garbage.
[01:12:49.274 --> 01:12:51.795]  Which then will just militarize them more and turn them against the people.
[01:12:51.915 --> 01:12:52.995]  Which the globalists are trying.
[01:12:53.295 --> 01:12:54.415]  They want us against each other.
[01:12:55.675 --> 01:12:56.496]  So he just joined us.
[01:12:56.576 --> 01:12:58.356]  Montel Williams came out yesterday.
[01:12:58.456 --> 01:13:00.097]  The article's on InfoWars.com.
[01:13:02.137 --> 01:13:05.678]  And he said Alex Jones inspires people to quote, blow things up.
[01:13:08.712 --> 01:13:14.498]  For us daring to send out a tweet with the Indianapolis star.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:20.403]  That's the thing, other media outlets don't send out someone else's news article.
[01:13:20.423 --> 01:13:21.264]  It's only about them.
[01:13:21.585 --> 01:13:23.587]  We send everybody's stuff out, mainstream, alternative.
[01:13:23.607 --> 01:13:25.368]  We don't, we just want to defeat the tyranny.
[01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:28.852]  It just shows how twisted these people are.
[01:13:28.872 --> 01:13:31.855]  And then he goes on to say we're cokeheads and everything else with no proof.
[01:13:33.211 --> 01:13:35.593]  Again, because I have energy, I must be on drugs.
[01:13:36.093 --> 01:13:38.734]  You think I can have this much energy for 20 years and be on drugs?
[01:13:39.575 --> 01:13:41.376]  Yeah, I have two cups of coffee a day.
[01:13:41.956 --> 01:13:43.537]  I drink some tea occasionally, iced tea.
[01:13:44.758 --> 01:13:45.479]  I drink some beer.
[01:13:46.179 --> 01:13:47.760]  I don't even use nicotine products.
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:48.701]  Nothing.
[01:13:49.745 --> 01:13:50.125]  Nothing.
[01:13:50.666 --> 01:13:56.148]  And you have the nerve to sit there and call me a drug addict because you're not man enough to stand up for humanity?
[01:13:56.389 --> 01:13:57.949]  That is shameful, Montel Williams.
[01:13:58.510 --> 01:14:00.411]  And I can't believe both these people, I like them.
[01:14:00.911 --> 01:14:06.654]  Of all those obnoxious talk show hosts, Montel Williams seemed like he wanted to cover some good subjects.
[01:14:06.714 --> 01:14:09.315]  I haven't watched his show, but maybe 20 times over the last 30 years.
[01:14:09.736 --> 01:14:10.376]  That's still a lot.
[01:14:11.376 --> 01:14:13.357]  Now, somebody I did like was David Cross.
[01:14:14.018 --> 01:14:17.540]  Very funny comedian, top 10 comedian in the US, in the top 10.
[01:14:18.905 --> 01:14:34.890]  He put out a movie that's now making the rounds that we just learned of called Hits and it's directed by him and I bet my bottom dollar I'm not accusing him of this like he just makes stuff about me.
[01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:39.031]  It's a movie you know basically demonizing
[01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:50.373]  Grassroots organizations, protesters, and it's got all these protesters at the City Hall protesting all the hippies supporting this guy that's leading them, who's just kind of a regular, you know, guy who's kind of fallen down.
[01:14:50.393 --> 01:14:56.916]  And then he goes into, and I, you know, and it's the Jews and blah blah blah and the N-word.
[01:14:57.597 --> 01:14:59.057]  Alex Jones told me all this.
[01:14:59.137 --> 01:15:00.218]  I learned this from Alex Jones.
[01:15:02.079 --> 01:15:04.820]  Now folks, that's the opposite of what he would have learned from Alex Jones.
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:15.304]  So someone smart like David Cross shows what an incredibly slimy, nasty person he is, because I bet money he was paid.
[01:15:15.324 --> 01:15:19.465]  Now again, I'm not saying this, that I know it, but I know how media works.
[01:15:19.625 --> 01:15:25.427]  I bet... I bet him $5,000.
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:34.984]  That if he can show me his funding sheet, and show me the documents, because there'll be an official sheet, you know, that shows who were product placements.
[01:15:35.024 --> 01:15:36.104]  I bet it's even in the credits.
[01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:37.745]  It may not say what they paid for.
[01:15:37.765 --> 01:15:39.666]  We need to look at the credits of this film.
[01:15:39.826 --> 01:15:42.288]  I bet money he was paid.
[01:15:42.408 --> 01:15:44.789]  Or they told him, we'll distribute your film, but attack the Liberty Movement.
[01:15:44.909 --> 01:15:46.490]  Because that's what the whole film basically is about.
[01:15:49.091 --> 01:15:50.932]  And so, that's where all this is going.
[01:15:51.252 --> 01:15:57.356]  Imagine someone that's ever heard... I mean, the movie Prisoners comes out, and the child molester kidnapper is named Alex Jones.
[01:15:58.496 --> 01:16:02.037]  And people are noticing that bad guys are named Alex Jones now all over the place.
[01:16:03.417 --> 01:16:07.578]  Just a month ago, there was some other TV show, I'll pop it in a minute, where the bad guy's named Alex Jones.
[01:16:08.539 --> 01:16:14.600]  Or where they make fake websites that look exactly like my site, talking about crazy stuff, and they implant it subliminally on Comedy Central.
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:17.301]  I mean, there's so much of this, we can't even keep track of it.
[01:16:17.661 --> 01:16:26.043]  And again, it's happening because we will hold up the vaccine insert where it says for MMR, it can give you epilepsy or diabetes or pancreatitis or kill you.
[01:16:27.150 --> 01:16:28.330]  I mean, they just can't have that.
[01:16:29.151 --> 01:16:30.711]  I don't debate them on their fake level.
[01:16:30.751 --> 01:16:33.473]  I just bypass their fake debates and go right to the documentation.
[01:16:34.273 --> 01:16:39.455]  And if the way we do things, just straight shooting people, starts spreading folks, it's over for them.
[01:16:41.633 --> 01:16:45.496]  Now let's go to this clip, we've bleeped out the n-word, but everything else is edited.
[01:16:45.737 --> 01:16:48.059]  Because they would go on the news and say that I'm saying the n-word.
[01:16:48.419 --> 01:16:50.261]  That's how deceptive this scum is.
[01:16:50.581 --> 01:16:54.024]  And listen, they assassinate your character before they kill you, okay?
[01:16:54.544 --> 01:17:04.393]  And I have to be honest, I'm not being dramatic, an attack of this level on a daily basis across media spectrums, they are attempting, if they can destroy my name, they're going to kill me.
[01:17:05.779 --> 01:17:08.119]  They will kill me if they're able to destroy my name.
[01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:10.620]  And I'm not, quite frankly, I don't want to die, but I'm not a coward.
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:12.320]  I'm a real man and I'm standing up.
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:13.281]  I'm not afraid of any of you.
[01:17:13.681 --> 01:17:14.541]  So you do whatever you do.
[01:17:14.581 --> 01:17:15.581]  You go and destroy my name.
[01:17:15.941 --> 01:17:16.901]  You go ahead and lie to me.
[01:17:17.441 --> 01:17:20.522]  I mean, you go ahead and lie about me and you go ahead and do all that.
[01:17:20.622 --> 01:17:23.923]  I'm going to stand up till the end against you people.
[01:17:23.983 --> 01:17:28.724]  And it doesn't matter because I know that I'm standing up for the unborn and the innocence and everybody else.
[01:17:29.004 --> 01:17:31.024]  And not because I'm a hero, because I'm a regular guy.
[01:17:31.224 --> 01:17:32.405]  We're going to skip this network breaks.
[01:17:32.425 --> 01:17:33.745]  We have plenty of time to play this clip.
[01:17:34.765 --> 01:17:38.531]  But this, this is, praise the Lord, folks, this is, this is, thank God!
[01:17:40.498 --> 01:17:41.559]  Because I've prayed to God.
[01:17:41.579 --> 01:17:43.139]  You've heard me on air, but I pray privately.
[01:17:43.179 --> 01:17:44.900]  Just please make me be a good person.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.100]  Help me be strong.
[01:17:46.781 --> 01:17:55.104]  And please give me the will to work as hard as I can and the words to reach people, to unlock their hearts and minds so that they not be destroyed by this.
[01:17:55.685 --> 01:17:59.166]  Because I have children that will grow up with your children and their children and their children.
[01:17:59.406 --> 01:18:00.527]  We are all together.
[01:18:00.567 --> 01:18:01.487]  We are all one.
[01:18:01.787 --> 01:18:03.548]  We are all one together.
[01:18:03.608 --> 01:18:05.289]  And I, you know what?
[01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:06.770]  I forgive you Montel Williams.
[01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:07.750]  You must really need money.
[01:18:08.170 --> 01:18:09.571]  And I mean this sincerely from my heart.
[01:18:10.529 --> 01:18:11.470]  Not to look like the better man.
[01:18:30.842 --> 01:18:32.142]  It's bad luck, man.
[01:18:32.162 --> 01:18:45.685]  You know, lying about somebody that's trying to be good, lying about somebody who's been persecuted, trying to lie to people out there to turn them away from the truth, to turn them away from trying to heal our land, you really have joined with evil.
[01:18:46.746 --> 01:18:49.906]  And I think God's going to punish you for it if you don't repent.
[01:18:51.687 --> 01:18:56.688]  So we need to pray for Montel Williams and David Cross, that God humbled them.
[01:18:57.622 --> 01:19:01.345]  And that God show them his true power and bring them to their knees.
[01:19:02.346 --> 01:19:14.416]  Because this whole army of sellouts that would not just join with the system, but that would premeditatedly try to make people think that I don't like black people.
[01:19:15.236 --> 01:19:17.618]  When all I try to do is save the unborn.
[01:19:17.638 --> 01:19:18.939]  I don't care whether they're black or white.
[01:19:23.083 --> 01:19:25.325]  To lie about me when you know I'm trying to bring people together.
[01:19:27.472 --> 01:19:29.453]  You don't hurt me with your fake political correctness.
[01:19:30.413 --> 01:19:31.213]  You hurt yourself.
[01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:35.355]  And I pray that every weapon formed against us will not prosper.
[01:19:35.635 --> 01:19:36.756]  And I know that will be true.
[01:19:37.516 --> 01:19:38.636]  I mean, I'm not stupid.
[01:19:38.696 --> 01:19:44.598]  If they physically kill me, it will only make everything I've done a hundred times stronger.
[01:19:44.638 --> 01:19:45.699]  That's why they haven't done it.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.441]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[01:19:52.401 --> 01:19:53.602]  And I want everybody to pray
[01:19:54.906 --> 01:20:11.297]  Pray with me that men who are talented and smart and who we can't judge, we don't know their hearts, we don't know their evil, but have been deceived or twisted or manipulated into lying about good people and trying to hurt innocents that might find the truth.
[01:20:11.977 --> 01:20:13.639]  I just pray that their hearts be changed.
[01:20:14.239 --> 01:20:17.061]  And I pray that God show them his incredible power.
[01:20:18.822 --> 01:20:19.883]  And I pray it happens.
[01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:22.925]  I pray it happens today.
[01:20:24.704 --> 01:20:25.164]  Pray with me.
[01:20:25.765 --> 01:20:29.988]  Pray with me that these men like Saul on the road to Damascus be humbled.
[01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:36.992]  You sign on to destroy what we're trying to do.
[01:20:38.253 --> 01:20:42.576]  You've signed on to the greatest evils the world has ever seen.
[01:20:43.096 --> 01:20:47.019]  You serve the New World Order with your heart and your will and your mind.
[01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:50.061]  You have turned yourself over directly to Satan.
[01:20:51.042 --> 01:20:53.904]  You are riding in the car with the devil.
[01:20:55.782 --> 01:21:06.248]  And because the things I talk about challenge your whole worldview, that's why you attack me and lie about me and lie about everything we do at Infowars, because you know deep down it's true.
[01:21:07.128 --> 01:21:08.189]  You're smart men.
[01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:18.895]  You're just two examples of the latest where you're attempting to inoculate the public with poison and lies against the name Alex Jones.
[01:21:19.135 --> 01:21:20.936]  And I've explained this to the listeners a hundred times.
[01:21:22.148 --> 01:21:31.830]  They want to bring me down, not because I'm the greatest guy or I'm the hero, but because I'm somebody willing to step across the line first against the enemy.
[01:21:32.050 --> 01:21:33.871]  And if others follow, it's over for them.
[01:21:34.231 --> 01:21:35.251]  I'm sincere.
[01:21:35.271 --> 01:21:39.452]  The enemy has assessed me years ago and they know I'm real.
[01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:41.913]  And that spirit is what threatens them.
[01:21:43.305 --> 01:21:49.469]  The flesh, and the simple person I am, and the simple person you are, are failed, and are wicked.
[01:21:49.689 --> 01:21:57.073]  But the spirit in us that God made, when it points towards God, like a flower opening to the sun, is unstoppable.
[01:21:58.774 --> 01:22:02.136]  You have to realize how epic this battle is, this great test.
[01:22:02.156 --> 01:22:03.737]  You're only alive once, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:04.998 --> 01:22:07.680]  In this space and time, you need to take action.
[01:22:08.803 --> 01:22:09.703]  This is your test.
[01:22:09.763 --> 01:22:12.924]  Don't sit there in the Matrix watching television all day.
[01:22:14.305 --> 01:22:15.505]  Go out and reach others.
[01:22:15.545 --> 01:22:16.666]  Realize you are leaders.
[01:22:17.706 --> 01:22:19.507]  Now let's go to this latest blasphemous piece.
[01:22:19.547 --> 01:22:20.767]  Let me set it up for radio listeners.
[01:22:21.227 --> 01:22:24.549]  Our radio listeners can go to InfoWars.com on their smartphones, droids, anything.
[01:22:25.009 --> 01:22:27.530]  Mobile devices, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:30.464]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:22:30.544 --> 01:22:31.785]  Send that out to your friends and family.
[01:22:31.885 --> 01:22:32.506]  It's a war.
[01:22:32.586 --> 01:22:33.707]  They can demonize us.
[01:22:33.987 --> 01:22:35.088]  They can shut us down.
[01:22:35.328 --> 01:22:36.289]  This can backfire.
[01:22:36.649 --> 01:22:41.693]  You reach out to their supporters and their fans and you say, look at how he lied about him.
[01:22:42.654 --> 01:22:46.057]  Look at how he said that Alex hates black people and basically loves Hitler.
[01:22:46.517 --> 01:22:47.458]  Why would they lie about him?
[01:22:47.498 --> 01:22:48.118]  What's he saying?
[01:22:48.338 --> 01:22:53.803]  They can come listen to us and find out the truth and find out why they were probably paid to do this.
[01:22:54.926 --> 01:23:02.749]  Government spends hundreds of billions of dollars in the last decade with fake news and paying people to put out fake information and demonization campaigns.
[01:23:02.969 --> 01:23:08.411]  There's no way that everyday major media is attacking us with the same lies out of the clear blue sky.
[01:23:08.631 --> 01:23:09.652]  This is a talking point.
[01:23:09.992 --> 01:23:17.455]  I watch Media Matters put out lies against us, overtly run by the White House, and then within hours I see it mimicked everywhere.
[01:23:19.136 --> 01:23:22.117]  What does it mean that the White House has their guns swung around on us?
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:24.441]  It means they're weak.
[01:23:24.461 --> 01:23:25.763]  It means they're evil.
[01:23:26.023 --> 01:23:26.704]  It means we're right.
[01:23:28.827 --> 01:23:29.808]  It means they're pathetic.
[01:23:29.908 --> 01:23:38.159]  If we, this little InfoWars operation, and you the listeners that have the power, if you've got them concerned, it shows how weak they are.
[01:23:40.452 --> 01:23:43.513]  Like I said last hour, suddenly GMO is getting taken off the shelves.
[01:23:43.894 --> 01:23:45.134]  Suddenly McDonald's is pulling it.
[01:23:45.414 --> 01:23:47.135]  Suddenly hundreds of other big firms are doing it.
[01:23:47.695 --> 01:23:48.155]  Suddenly!
[01:23:48.796 --> 01:23:51.997]  It's all over, mainstream news that fluoride is causing brain damage and it's true.
[01:23:52.377 --> 01:24:04.983]  Well because two different times in the last 10 years, once 10 years ago, once 3 years ago, led by Dr. Conant and others, they had almost 100% of the EPA and FDA scientists together organize, you know how hard that is?
[01:24:05.383 --> 01:24:09.545]  Send letters saying remove hydrofluorosilicic acid, it gives you cancer and brain damages.
[01:24:10.185 --> 01:24:11.105]  And attacks the thyroid.
[01:24:13.506 --> 01:24:18.469]  Can you imagine the time bomb they're sitting on after they put this in the water and killed tens of millions with it?
[01:24:18.829 --> 01:24:20.689]  With the cancers alone and the bone cancer?
[01:24:21.330 --> 01:24:21.670]  Alone?
[01:24:22.630 --> 01:24:23.210]  Tens of millions.
[01:24:23.731 --> 01:24:26.632]  Can you, since the 40s, can you imagine?
[01:24:27.472 --> 01:24:28.693]  See, the dam's breaking.
[01:24:28.733 --> 01:24:30.213]  That's why the enemy's moving right now.
[01:24:30.834 --> 01:24:33.255]  The enemy is cornered right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:33.275 --> 01:24:35.136]  The spirit of awakening is here.
[01:24:36.596 --> 01:24:38.377]  And we're only a tiny detonator.
[01:24:39.281 --> 01:24:46.789]  I'm like a little bitty cap on the back of a huge shell loaded with plastic explosives in the Infowar.
[01:24:47.670 --> 01:24:49.012]  Peaceful bombs of truth.
[01:24:49.412 --> 01:24:50.473]  I'm just a detonator.
[01:24:52.455 --> 01:24:56.740]  I'm little, you're little, but together we chain reaction detonate, it's over.
[01:24:57.661 --> 01:24:58.923]  Once we come out of the trance.
[01:25:00.495 --> 01:25:10.461]  Once we admit we were lied to, once we admit it's scary, it's not scary anymore because now we're not subconsciously oppressed and afraid with the messages of the New World Order menacing us.
[01:25:11.202 --> 01:25:14.704]  Inside, the subliminals are, we're gonna kill you with the New World Order, do what we say.
[01:25:14.924 --> 01:25:16.625]  Where's the New World Order on the surface?
[01:25:16.865 --> 01:25:19.527]  So that we stay afraid, okay, if I just deny it, I'll be safe.
[01:25:19.787 --> 01:25:21.949]  No, no, no, denying it lets the enemy come.
[01:25:22.509 --> 01:25:24.090]  Hit the lights, turn the lights on.
[01:25:25.271 --> 01:25:27.072]  And the vampires will incinerate.
[01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:36.875]  Let's go to that clip of the demonization from the Portlandia Mr. Show, you name it.
[01:25:36.895 --> 01:25:42.639]  He's behind it now putting out movies that end with the fact that Alex Jones is causing a rebellion.
[01:25:42.779 --> 01:25:45.682]  Alex Jones is really a closet racist, fooling the hippies.
[01:25:45.722 --> 01:25:50.105]  The hippies are all cheering the Alex Jones character until he admits he's really a racist.
[01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:50.565]  Here it is.
[01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:54.448]  Well, guess who's feeling ridiculous now, Ms.
[01:25:54.488 --> 01:25:54.929]  Caserta?
[01:25:55.896 --> 01:26:01.781]  Because, because I have the whole town, and TV, and the entire internet.
[01:26:03.522 --> 01:26:06.565]  And no one's here to make a fool of yourself.
[01:26:07.225 --> 01:26:09.447]  Let's stay calm.
[01:26:09.607 --> 01:26:13.670]  I am one man trying to seek redress from his elected officials.
[01:26:14.251 --> 01:26:16.773]  I am trying to right a wrong for liberty.
[01:26:16.793 --> 01:26:16.913]  Time.
[01:26:17.293 --> 01:26:18.234]  Thank you, Mr. Stewart.
[01:26:18.254 --> 01:26:18.514]  No more.
[01:26:18.594 --> 01:26:19.015]  No, no.
[01:26:19.315 --> 01:26:20.156]  I have more to say.
[01:26:20.176 --> 01:26:21.417]  That is all the time you have.
[01:26:21.497 --> 01:26:21.737]  No!
[01:26:21.977 --> 01:26:23.058]  You will let me speak!
[01:26:23.338 --> 01:26:24.839]  You will let me speak!
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:27.981]  Let Dave speak!
[01:26:28.041 --> 01:26:29.102]  Let Dave speak!
[01:26:29.142 --> 01:26:30.122]  Let Dave speak!
[01:26:30.142 --> 01:26:31.223]  We're in the U.S.
[01:26:31.323 --> 01:26:35.564]  Constitution that doesn't say that people only have three minutes to speak!
[01:26:35.604 --> 01:26:36.645]  Let Dave speak!
[01:26:36.925 --> 01:26:37.966]  Ask your lawyer that!
[01:26:38.266 --> 01:26:39.666]  Ask your lawyer that!
[01:26:39.726 --> 01:26:44.528]  And I will have the rest of you thrown out for public disturbance!
[01:26:44.809 --> 01:26:48.150]  And it's because of those Jews who run that stupid ACLU!
[01:26:48.250 --> 01:26:49.991]  And they won't return my letters!
[01:26:50.111 --> 01:26:54.758]  Because they're too busy defending all the... He's covering the earth like gays and Muslims!
[01:26:54.778 --> 01:26:55.900]  That is wide enough!
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:27:01.749]  That is because you are taking marching orders from Barack Obama, that socialist... in the White House!
[01:27:02.734 --> 01:27:03.455]  Yes you are!
[01:27:03.935 --> 01:27:05.357]  You are being bullied by him!
[01:27:06.338 --> 01:27:08.380]  And I don't even support him officially!
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.522]  Barack Hussein Obama!
[01:27:11.122 --> 01:27:12.864]  Did you know Barack is a Jewish word?
[01:27:13.144 --> 01:27:13.965]  And it means lightning.
[01:27:14.105 --> 01:27:14.866]  It's in the Bible.
[01:27:14.926 --> 01:27:16.127]  Luke 10, 18.
[01:27:16.367 --> 01:27:19.510]  Satan came down as lightning!
[01:27:19.530 --> 01:27:23.134]  Satan will come down as lightning!
[01:27:23.214 --> 01:27:24.095]  That's in the Bible!
[01:27:24.135 --> 01:27:25.156]  I want it in the record!
[01:27:25.696 --> 01:27:26.818]  I want it in the record!
[01:27:28.327 --> 01:27:36.870]  You and all the liberal Jew-run media and their enablers, they are authorizing the corporate elite in this country!
[01:27:36.970 --> 01:27:39.911]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[01:27:40.191 --> 01:27:42.912]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[01:27:42.972 --> 01:27:45.193]  You're the problem, Mitch Kucerna!
[01:27:45.313 --> 01:27:46.954]  You and your own global warming!
[01:27:47.054 --> 01:27:48.774]  Is global warming such a problem?
[01:27:48.874 --> 01:27:53.016]  How come my street had snow all over it for an entire winter?
[01:27:53.856 --> 01:27:54.516]  How come?
[01:27:55.217 --> 01:27:56.237]  I am talking!
[01:27:56.775 --> 01:27:57.875]  Now the police drag him out.
[01:27:57.995 --> 01:27:59.996]  So let's just stop right there.
[01:28:00.016 --> 01:28:05.397]  We're going to do a whole article on this tomorrow and we'll put my response and video in here so people understand what we're dealing with.
[01:28:06.597 --> 01:28:08.277]  But this is criminal propaganda.
[01:28:08.518 --> 01:28:16.939]  There is no doubt that a jury would not award me damages when I took him to trial and they got to subpoena me, I subpoenaed them, depositions.
[01:28:17.439 --> 01:28:21.760]  And we can show that I never said any of this and that he literally tried to defame me and hurt me there.
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.401]  But you know what, David Cross?
[01:28:23.421 --> 01:28:24.121]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:28:25.071 --> 01:28:26.353]  You have defamed yourself.
[01:28:27.153 --> 01:28:28.415]  You are a liar.
[01:28:30.657 --> 01:28:33.361]  And you have basically already given me satisfaction.
[01:28:33.381 --> 01:28:35.583]  I don't need to take you out in the street politically and flog you.
[01:28:37.485 --> 01:28:39.648]  But I'm really sad for you.
[01:28:40.849 --> 01:28:41.710]  You know why they did this?
[01:28:42.211 --> 01:28:43.572]  Probably paid product placement.
[01:28:44.914 --> 01:28:45.735]  Propaganda placement.
[01:28:47.230 --> 01:28:58.275]  They did this because I'm addressing the fact that the so-called liberal establishment are a bunch of war-mongering, NSA-loving, power-grabbing, insurance company criminals with Obamacare and the rest of it.
[01:28:59.373 --> 01:29:11.079]  That the Democratic leadership fascistically works with the Republican leadership to screw this country over by the very same bankers looting Greece and Portugal and Brazil and Nigeria and Ireland and everywhere else.
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:17.623]  And we're coming together globally with solidarity for real freedom and true liberalism like Thomas Jefferson promoted.
[01:29:18.023 --> 01:29:20.925]  The liberalism of teaching women how to use guns and protect themselves.
[01:29:21.145 --> 01:29:22.966]  The liberalism of letting you keep more of your money.
[01:29:23.166 --> 01:29:26.828]  The liberalism of having sovereignty and honoring and loving humanity.
[01:29:28.206 --> 01:29:29.907]  Not loving all this tyranny.
[01:29:30.047 --> 01:29:35.810]  You are a bunch of fashionable fops, a bunch of fake trendy liberals who aren't liberals at all.
[01:29:36.010 --> 01:29:40.772]  You're a bunch of totalitarians promoting anti-speech laws and every other form of garbage.
[01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:43.493]  You want to run everybody's lives and bully everyone.
[01:29:43.833 --> 01:29:51.817]  You're having to resort to lying about people like me that are real liberals compared to propagandists like you.
[01:29:52.157 --> 01:29:53.518]  You have now discredited yourselves.
[01:29:53.838 --> 01:29:55.059]  You are now jokes.
[01:29:55.859 --> 01:29:56.819]  So apologize.
[01:29:57.380 --> 01:29:58.060]  This is shameful.
[01:29:59.563 --> 01:30:02.566]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.507 --> 01:30:06.190]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.214 --> 01:30:17.160]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.
[01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:26.849]  At InfoWars Life, our mission is to bring you the highest quality, purest, cleanest, effective colloidal silver on the market today for the lowest price available.
[01:30:27.049 --> 01:30:35.076]  You don't have to be a doctor to know the fall and winter months are the most dangerous time of year in North America when it comes to you and your family's health.
[01:30:35.316 --> 01:30:44.766]  Infowarslife.com is very excited to announce our biggest run yet of silver bullet colloidal silver exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.

[01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:05.190]  Silver Bullet.
[01:31:10.111 --> 01:31:18.801]  Sold out for weeks through the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[01:31:19.102 --> 01:31:29.074]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:31:29.634 --> 01:31:35.722]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:31:36.063 --> 01:31:42.211]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:31:42.471 --> 01:31:45.134]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[01:31:45.835 --> 01:31:46.655]  We're good to go.
[01:32:11.118 --> 01:32:12.198]  In the near future.
[01:32:12.459 --> 01:32:16.100]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:16.600]  Security alert.
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:17.981]  Security alert.
[01:32:18.181 --> 01:32:19.921]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:32:20.181 --> 01:32:20.822]  Analysis.
[01:32:21.082 --> 01:32:21.722]  InfoWars.
[01:32:21.782 --> 01:32:23.743]  Building independent media operations.
[01:32:23.763 --> 01:32:28.745]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:28.765 --> 01:32:29.725]  Crime Directive.
[01:32:29.805 --> 01:32:31.246]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:31.346 --> 01:32:34.127]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:34.207 --> 01:32:37.268]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:37.448 --> 01:32:39.629]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:39.929 --> 01:32:41.230]  People are assaulting us!
[01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:43.551]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:44.092 --> 01:32:45.773]  They're never going to stop.
[01:32:46.053 --> 01:32:49.955]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:32:50.075 --> 01:32:53.277]  Block free iPhone ads at Infowars.com.
[01:32:53.677 --> 01:32:56.339]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:32:57.039 --> 01:32:57.780]  Imperative.
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:00.041]  Deploy Prism Planet TV.
[01:33:00.061 --> 01:33:04.464]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:33:04.484 --> 01:33:06.105]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:33:06.145 --> 01:33:06.865]  You can feel it!
[01:33:11.656 --> 01:33:16.705]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.066 --> 01:33:19.350]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:33:24.037 --> 01:33:24.357]  Five.
[01:33:25.038 --> 01:33:28.519]  The Democratic Party, and the Republicans are hardly corrupt as well, come out of the same group.
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:31.061]  The Democratic Party, though, was the party of the Klan.
[01:33:31.841 --> 01:33:33.702]  They were the party of racial division.
[01:33:34.122 --> 01:33:42.386]  When the demographics changed and Eisenhower and the Republicans passed the Civil Rights Act, they were going to be doomed because the minorities were voting 90% back then.
[01:33:42.446 --> 01:33:45.228]  I mean, Martin Luther King back at that point was voting Republican on record.
[01:33:45.988 --> 01:33:48.072]  So they had big, big problems.
[01:33:48.653 --> 01:33:51.618]  So they completely flipped and said, oh, we love the minorities.
[01:33:51.638 --> 01:33:52.420]  We're going to give you freebies.
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:53.942]  We're going to give you welfare.
[01:33:55.197 --> 01:33:57.718]  And that was when basically they checked the Republicans.
[01:33:58.098 --> 01:34:10.421]  So the Republicans went with the Southern strategy and flipped in the South, because there was already some Republicans didn't like what Eisenhower was doing, and the North, and they did kind of become, you know, a little bit racist party.
[01:34:10.461 --> 01:34:11.101]  So that's true.
[01:34:11.481 --> 01:34:13.781]  They were trying to then flip sides and act like the Democrats.
[01:34:14.381 --> 01:34:16.762]  But the real roots, the Democratic Party folks.
[01:34:17.970 --> 01:34:23.493]  Margaret Sanger, David Rockefeller, they said we've got to be fake liberals, we've got to lead the blacks, we can kill these weeds.
[01:34:23.993 --> 01:34:24.754]  Now those are quotes.
[01:34:26.275 --> 01:34:28.216]  Got awards from Hitler, gave awards from Hitler.
[01:34:28.456 --> 01:34:35.379]  I'm talking about Rockefeller's daddy, I'm talking about Thomas Watson, I'm talking about Margaret Sanger.
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:39.922]  I mean Thomas Watson got the highest Nazi award ever given.
[01:34:42.421 --> 01:34:48.505]  The highest Nazi award ever given, created by Adolf Hitler, the Iron Cross First Class with four eagles.
[01:34:51.487 --> 01:34:52.648]  He basically gave them all his money.
[01:34:52.928 --> 01:34:55.390]  The death camps, everything, the computers, the numbers.
[01:34:55.810 --> 01:34:58.031]  Now they run the death list for the veterans.
[01:34:58.392 --> 01:34:59.673]  Cannot make that up.
[01:34:59.873 --> 01:35:01.113]  The computer's called Thomas.
[01:35:01.634 --> 01:35:02.234]  Cannot.
[01:35:02.875 --> 01:35:05.416]  How about the symbol be an Iron Cross with four eagles on it?
[01:35:05.897 --> 01:35:07.318]  So this is why they hate my guts.
[01:35:08.157 --> 01:35:14.001]  We pioneered, before it was in the London Guardian, before it was in the New York Times, that Brown Brother Harriman funded the Nazis.
[01:35:14.922 --> 01:35:20.666]  We pioneered the documents with Anthony Sutton before he died that came out in Congress secretly in the 70s.
[01:35:20.766 --> 01:35:27.871]  And then we covered it all in the 90s and mainlined what later all came out and Oliver Stone's made documentaries about.
[01:35:28.371 --> 01:35:31.333]  We pioneered it in films like Martial Law, 2004.
[01:35:34.397 --> 01:35:38.240]  I'm not bragging, but I mean, we pioneered exposing Nazis.
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:41.263]  We pioneered exposing eugenics, and now it's under the surface.
[01:35:41.563 --> 01:35:44.706]  We pioneered showing how 52% of black people are never born.
[01:35:45.546 --> 01:35:47.928]  I mean, if I was a racist, I'd be, oh, I'm liberal.
[01:35:48.028 --> 01:35:49.310]  Oh, yeah, black people, I love you.
[01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:51.531]  You have your right to abortion, sweetie.
[01:35:52.292 --> 01:35:54.794]  I'd be, oh, Gardasil's good for the Mexican girls.
[01:35:55.234 --> 01:35:56.476]  Take your shots.
[01:35:59.224 --> 01:36:01.365]  But I don't need to defend myself that I'm not a racist.
[01:36:01.726 --> 01:36:04.147]  They beat you over the head and say, three meals a day, you're a racist.
[01:36:04.428 --> 01:36:05.788]  Don't vote for Obama, you're a racist.
[01:36:05.808 --> 01:36:07.009]  Don't turn your guns on, you're a racist.
[01:36:07.349 --> 01:36:09.071]  It's all their attempt at bullying.
[01:36:10.311 --> 01:36:19.318]  Now I want to get into the Second Amendment news and a little bit more here, and then I'm going to throw the baton to, because what's the point of going on a couple days vacation if you don't take the kids to the beach?
[01:36:20.378 --> 01:36:26.763]  And they want to go see some of the military bases and stuff around here that are open, show a lot of cool aircraft and things flying around down here.
[01:36:29.242 --> 01:36:31.403]  My son's off DC fishing with my dad right now.
[01:36:32.484 --> 01:36:36.606]  But, gosh, it's just so desperate and so disreputable.
[01:36:37.246 --> 01:36:38.227]  And so dirty.
[01:36:38.307 --> 01:36:54.715]  I mean, it's just, when you catch people out in the open, I say catch them, just, just absolutely, you know, lying that we're racist cokeheads that want to blow up buildings and hate black people and Jews.
[01:36:55.740 --> 01:37:02.504]  And then, you go to all the Nazi websites, I mean, go to any of the biggest ones, and I am the number one enemy.
[01:37:03.384 --> 01:37:08.907]  And it's because at the top, folks, those places are 100% government run.
[01:37:09.588 --> 01:37:20.994]  I mean, if you want to create opposition to control it, you've got to have it be unsavory and hateful so that anybody that ever criticizes Israel's manipulation of US politics looks like a total idiot.
[01:37:21.294 --> 01:37:21.875]  That's what's going on.
[01:37:22.455 --> 01:37:26.237]  Because I have real criticisms of Israel, but it's not because, you know, there's Jews in Israel.
[01:37:26.257 --> 01:37:28.098]  It's because governments get corrupted out of control.
[01:37:28.698 --> 01:37:29.899]  But I don't hate Israel.
[01:37:30.659 --> 01:37:31.940]  And see, people know that.
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:36.902]  I don't hate white people, black people, Hispanics, mixed race, anybody.
[01:37:37.122 --> 01:37:39.284]  I hate tyrants and criminals and bullies.
[01:37:39.304 --> 01:37:40.844]  And there are gangs and bullies everywhere.
[01:37:41.205 --> 01:37:43.726]  I like police departments that are upstanding and follow the Constitution.
[01:37:44.006 --> 01:37:45.767]  I don't like departments that are bully-thug-run.
[01:37:47.611 --> 01:37:48.473]  I like black people.
[01:37:48.573 --> 01:37:53.963]  I don't like five black guys walking by, if I'm walking by myself, and saying, what are you doing, cracker?
[01:37:54.223 --> 01:37:55.946]  Want to get your ass handed to you?
[01:37:56.187 --> 01:37:57.089]  Go ahead and do something.
[01:37:59.141 --> 01:38:00.402]  And I grew up in Dallas, Texas, folks.
[01:38:00.482 --> 01:38:02.103]  I mean, I have been racially harassed.
[01:38:02.183 --> 01:38:07.626]  I guarantee you, you watch these movies with black people back in the South in the 50s and 60s getting beat up and attacked.
[01:38:08.246 --> 01:38:10.407]  That's just what racist gangs do to each other, folks.
[01:38:11.108 --> 01:38:14.910]  There were always huge majorities of Christian whites that weren't involved in any of that and hated it and fought it.
[01:38:15.190 --> 01:38:18.932]  You'd believe watching Political Correctness today that every white person out there was involved in all that.
[01:38:22.628 --> 01:38:32.557]  It doesn't matter that my grandfather ran as a Republican and when everybody else were Democrats and won office in East Texas and fought for civil rights.
[01:38:32.577 --> 01:38:33.257]  It doesn't matter.
[01:38:33.578 --> 01:38:37.461]  I am a racist because David Cross said so.
[01:38:37.801 --> 01:38:38.942]  And I don't like Jews either.
[01:38:38.962 --> 01:38:39.563]  It doesn't matter.
[01:38:39.603 --> 01:38:41.264]  Both my grandfathers almost died in World War II.
[01:38:42.230 --> 01:38:42.850]  Fighting Hitler?
[01:38:43.211 --> 01:38:46.613]  David Cross says, I don't like Jews.
[01:38:46.653 --> 01:38:53.337]  And David Cross is a little, simpering, funny, know-it-all guy that wears little sweaters and gets to go... So he gets to lie about people.
[01:38:53.497 --> 01:38:54.478]  He gets to defame people.
[01:38:57.059 --> 01:38:58.220]  He gets to prey on people.
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:38:59.501]  Prey on his viewers.
[01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:11.294]  And they've now got comic teams around the country that go around and make fun of myself and Jesse Ventura and say things we didn't say that are involved.
[01:39:11.334 --> 01:39:12.936]  It turned out we just looked it up on his payroll.
[01:39:13.416 --> 01:39:13.636]  See?
[01:39:14.096 --> 01:39:15.958]  We're gonna follow this and find the money.
[01:39:16.278 --> 01:39:27.246]  And how are people gonna feel if we find, if we find bears crapping in the woods, if we find fish in the sea, that this was financed by an agency or a Ford Foundation?
[01:39:27.266 --> 01:39:29.988]  A George Soros?
[01:39:30.929 --> 01:39:33.271]  What's gonna happen when we find that, hmm?
[01:39:35.523 --> 01:39:38.245]  Everybody's gonna know you're a little government operative.
[01:39:38.405 --> 01:39:40.407]  Do you like little secret agent meetings you go to?
[01:39:40.867 --> 01:39:41.888]  Little InfraGard meetings?
[01:39:42.208 --> 01:39:43.149]  Feel pretty powerful?
[01:39:44.069 --> 01:39:45.931]  Southern Poverty Law Center got you some funding?
[01:39:46.551 --> 01:39:50.134]  Oh, I wonder what we're gonna find when we crawl into that rock down there with you.
[01:39:51.675 --> 01:39:54.437]  We're gonna find that Democratic Party right back to Margaret Sanger.
[01:39:54.777 --> 01:39:58.060]  Oh, I know, and the Nazis calling for my death all the time.
[01:39:58.900 --> 01:39:59.141]  Those?
[01:40:00.728 --> 01:40:01.689]  Let's go to David Knight.
[01:40:02.109 --> 01:40:04.411]  David Knight, a few minutes here and I'm going to throw the baton to you.
[01:40:04.491 --> 01:40:05.992]  What is your take on this attack?
[01:40:06.392 --> 01:40:07.733]  I mean, it's just daily now.
[01:40:08.594 --> 01:40:11.056]  I tell you, it makes the hair stand on the back of my neck.
[01:40:11.096 --> 01:40:12.497]  That's kind of an exciting feeling, David.
[01:40:12.797 --> 01:40:14.879]  But I can really feel the eyes of Sauron looking right at us.
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:28.090]  Yeah, Alex, when I look at what happened with Montel Williams yesterday, he's gone in the past and he's defended the veteran Tamarusi who went over the line there in Mexico and was being treated fairly there.
[01:40:28.331 --> 01:40:33.575]  But when it comes to the way our government treats people here, he has no problem with it.
[01:40:34.056 --> 01:40:39.360]  And on a day when we've got... And we see this tweeting mainstream article about how they're making fun of veterans dying.
[01:40:39.681 --> 01:40:41.642]  I mean, why are we bad to do that?
[01:40:41.722 --> 01:40:42.763]  Why would he pick that?
[01:40:42.803 --> 01:40:43.404]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:40:43.564 --> 01:40:44.145]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:44.205 --> 01:40:46.668]  If he's concerned as a veteran, he's a veteran.
[01:40:46.748 --> 01:40:54.156]  If he's concerned about the welfare of veterans, why wouldn't he notice that they're being mistreated, severely mistreated by the Veterans Administration?
[01:40:54.196 --> 01:41:00.883]  That we've had people at the VA come in repeatedly and say, showing that they have contempt for these people.
[01:41:01.324 --> 01:41:03.426]  And on a day when Hillary Clinton
[01:41:04.367 --> 01:41:15.056]  Is caught in ridiculous, ludicrous lies about emailing Bill, about how she set up a private email server because it was more convenient to set up an entire server in her house.
[01:41:15.336 --> 01:41:16.657]  She did that because of convenience.
[01:41:16.917 --> 01:41:18.959]  She said that she was using it to email Bill.
[01:41:19.359 --> 01:41:26.605]  And two hours, Alex, before she made this pronouncement at the United Nations Security Council, the Wall Street Journal had interviewed
[01:41:27.325 --> 01:41:32.209]  Somebody who was a spokesperson for Bill Clinton, and he said he's done two emails his entire life.
[01:41:32.449 --> 01:41:37.533]  She didn't have time to incorporate that lie into her speech, so she got caught red-handed.
[01:41:37.573 --> 01:41:41.296]  But of course, Montel Williams had nothing to say about that yesterday.
[01:41:41.817 --> 01:41:43.398]  Instead, he goes off on a jag with this article.
[01:41:43.418 --> 01:41:53.526]  I mean, it's a McHale-Phelan tweet at Real Alex Jones, saying, hey look, mainstream news reporting on what we reported on, that the veterans, you know, they're making fun of them when they die, and then he comes out and attacks us.
[01:41:53.586 --> 01:41:55.308]  I mean, what type of sickness is that?
[01:41:55.808 --> 01:41:55.988]  Yeah.
[01:41:56.248 --> 01:41:58.689]  By the way, Montel Williams, doesn't he have some neurological disorder?
[01:41:59.309 --> 01:42:01.109]  I bet he got that from all the vaccines he was given.
[01:42:01.129 --> 01:42:03.810]  Uh, I don't know about Montel Williams.
[01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:07.251]  When I saw this Twitter fight... He has multiple screws.
[01:42:07.271 --> 01:42:10.492]  I asked, uh, I asked my sons, I said, uh... Go ahead.
[01:42:10.792 --> 01:42:11.272]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:42:11.392 --> 01:42:15.693]  When I saw this Twitter fight, uh, my son said, who is Montel Williams?
[01:42:16.033 --> 01:42:17.114]  I said, I barely know.
[01:42:17.394 --> 01:42:19.654]  He was somebody that was around 20 years, and they're in their 20s.
[01:42:19.954 --> 01:42:20.555]  They're in mid-20s.
[01:42:20.595 --> 01:42:22.035]  I mean, nobody even knows who this guy is.
[01:42:22.715 --> 01:42:26.198]  The point is, it's part of the larger pattern.
[01:42:26.779 --> 01:42:36.427]  Why would David Cross with a movie, with his HBO shows and everything else, I mean, we're seeing this attack where they have villains say, I follow Alex Jones.
[01:42:36.687 --> 01:42:41.531]  Like trying to just classically at a Pavlovian level, shock someone whenever they hear my name.
[01:42:41.992 --> 01:42:44.874]  I mean, it is a very primitive but systematic attack.
[01:42:45.114 --> 01:42:46.996]  And it's clearly being directed, David.
[01:42:47.436 --> 01:42:47.677]  Oh yeah.
[01:42:48.357 --> 01:42:52.879]  And you saw a very directed, orchestrated attack against Gary Webb and a lot of people.
[01:42:52.919 --> 01:42:56.080]  I'd encourage people to go see the movie Shoot the Messenger.
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:58.441]  At first he was going to get a surprise.
[01:42:58.761 --> 01:43:05.144]  He was worthy of it and he did all this research and then the mainstream media came back and started attacking him on a personal level.
[01:43:05.704 --> 01:43:10.686]  And then after a number of years, I believe, as you do, that you talked to him just before he died.
[01:43:10.706 --> 01:43:12.047]  He was not committing suicide.
[01:43:12.087 --> 01:43:12.727]  He was suicided.
[01:43:12.827 --> 01:43:13.847]  I thought he didn't want to pull it, sir.
[01:43:13.867 --> 01:43:37.794]  Maybe they pulled it back, or maybe... I know he won a bunch of awards, but I mean, I know he was going to present on our website all his documents that he was putting in the new book, and he was so excited, and then a month later he's dead, and I talked to his friends, he goes, yeah, he had to move, they're breaking into his house, they're stealing his stuff, they stole his motorcycle, and they did that... I mean, folks, he was being harassed and threatened.
[01:43:38.846 --> 01:43:39.828]  I mean, you go see the movie.
[01:43:39.888 --> 01:43:40.449]  I saw the movie.
[01:43:40.489 --> 01:43:42.633]  I was nauseated because it was like a documentary.
[01:43:42.673 --> 01:43:44.436]  It was like, it was so accurate.
[01:43:45.182 --> 01:43:46.003]  Thank you so much, David.
[01:43:46.023 --> 01:43:47.264]  You're going to be taking over in the next segment.
[01:43:47.284 --> 01:43:52.207]  We're going to be throwing it to a report here in a moment from John Bowne on the Hillary situation.
[01:43:52.247 --> 01:43:56.330]  You can flesh that out and open the phones up, but here's the bottom line.
[01:43:56.891 --> 01:44:06.457]  Tell your friends and family, whether you listen on AM, FM, or the internet, send them links to the free podcast at InfoWars.com forward slash show, the free Droid and iPhone apps.
[01:44:06.918 --> 01:44:08.859]  If you have friends and family that are on Boxy, Roku,
[01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:12.502]  Or any other smart TV, internet TV system.
[01:44:12.883 --> 01:44:13.243]  Tell them!
[01:44:13.323 --> 01:44:14.664]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:44:15.145 --> 01:44:18.548]  Share your PrisonPlanet.TV membership with up to 20 people.
[01:44:20.293 --> 01:44:28.097]  At the end of your emails or your Facebook or your Twitter, post our articles, post links to our information, post links to the free audio stream feeds.
[01:44:28.477 --> 01:44:30.138]  This is how we reach more people.
[01:44:30.418 --> 01:44:31.739]  Go on mainstream websites.
[01:44:32.419 --> 01:44:36.541]  Spam our information out there to warn people this is what you do.
[01:44:36.862 --> 01:44:39.443]  They want to shut us down because you're taking action.
[01:44:39.763 --> 01:44:41.504]  And I'm not asking you to throttle back.
[01:44:44.555 --> 01:44:44.835]  I don't
[01:45:06.337 --> 01:45:07.578]  Number two, after Drudge.
[01:45:07.598 --> 01:45:15.005]  I mean, you go to Media Matters, run by the White House officially, weekly meetings of the White House, funded by George Soros, they are attacking Drudge and InfoWars.
[01:45:15.566 --> 01:45:19.190]  And then WorldNet Daily and Rush Limbaugh, because if they can take down Rush, they can take it all down.
[01:45:20.054 --> 01:45:22.816]  Even if you don't like Rush, they can take him down.
[01:45:22.856 --> 01:45:26.397]  They can take down what's seen as media not in the central globalist complex.
[01:45:26.858 --> 01:45:28.919]  So again, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:45:29.659 --> 01:45:31.540]  We've not plugged in an hour and 45 minutes.
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:32.981]  That's how we fund our whole operation.
[01:45:33.481 --> 01:45:34.782]  Spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:45:34.862 --> 01:45:36.623]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:45:37.063 --> 01:45:37.804]  DNA Force.
[01:45:38.564 --> 01:45:38.904]  I don't
[01:45:56.187 --> 01:46:03.072]  High-quality, organic, Bio-PQQ, CoQ10, just the list goes on and on.
[01:46:03.232 --> 01:46:04.873]  What this does is simply amazing.
[01:46:05.113 --> 01:46:08.415]  This is our super high-end at an incredibly low price product.
[01:46:08.475 --> 01:46:11.377]  It's selling out at the price we're selling it for right now.
[01:46:11.698 --> 01:46:13.879]  That special is going to continue while supplies last.
[01:46:14.219 --> 01:46:20.364]  Infowarslife.com, right down to our lowest cost product that is the highest quality, organic,
[01:46:21.314 --> 01:46:24.775]  Cold-pressed, $14.95 Ancient Defense.
[01:46:25.395 --> 01:46:26.475]  That's going to be our line.
[01:46:26.955 --> 01:46:28.676]  The Ancient Defense right side line.
[01:46:28.916 --> 01:46:35.477]  That's going to be the discount line of things that are inexpensive, high quality, easily sourced, that we can then have a discount line.
[01:46:35.897 --> 01:46:37.698]  Leading competitors have similar formulas for $30, $14.95.
[01:46:38.058 --> 01:46:44.039]  So we have the inexpensive up to the expensive that's still by getting a Ferrari for $50,000.
[01:46:44.479 --> 01:46:46.600]  A brand new Ferrari that's $200,000 for $50,000.
[01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:49.041]  That's the analogy of DNA Force.
[01:46:49.501 --> 01:46:50.361]  It's springtime.
[01:46:51.556 --> 01:46:55.640]  It's time to make that new commitment to get in shape, to clean out your cells.
[01:46:56.201 --> 01:46:58.243]  Go read about what DNA Force does.
[01:46:58.303 --> 01:47:03.187]  We can even make some claims with this because so much of it's patented and certified and gone through all the medical, you know, stuff.
[01:47:03.548 --> 01:47:04.369]  DNA Force.
[01:47:04.509 --> 01:47:05.390]  True Nutraceutical.
[01:47:05.710 --> 01:47:06.831]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:47:06.871 --> 01:47:07.191]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:47:14.138 --> 01:47:14.799]  3-1-3-9.
[01:47:15.279 --> 01:47:25.650]  I'm going to punch out and throw it to David Knight to take us out to break and play John's Bounce piece in the next segment, but you heard all the, you saw the articles last week.
[01:47:25.770 --> 01:47:31.416]  BBC, London Telegraph, Associated Press, Time Magazine has a new one out today, or is it Newsweek?
[01:47:31.896 --> 01:47:32.657]  It's here in my stack.
[01:47:32.717 --> 01:47:33.898]  Oh, I have the bullet story I need to hit.
[01:47:34.759 --> 01:47:35.880]  All of that's going on.
[01:47:36.921 --> 01:47:41.103]  And they're saying glyphosate, if you have glyphosate in the water, which is in almost all U.S.
[01:47:41.143 --> 01:47:44.925]  water, something like 95%, five-fold increase in kidney failure.
[01:47:45.045 --> 01:47:46.645]  It will kill your kidneys.
[01:47:46.945 --> 01:47:48.846]  Really, weed killer's not good for my kidneys?
[01:47:49.326 --> 01:47:51.747]  You mean my kidneys can't process weed killer?
[01:47:52.608 --> 01:47:55.169]  You mean my kidneys can't process antifreeze either?
[01:47:57.054 --> 01:47:57.574]  Wow!
[01:47:58.215 --> 01:48:00.937]  Maybe Montel Williams will attack me because I'm telling you that.
[01:48:01.217 --> 01:48:03.238]  And yeah, I like to sell things on the truth.
[01:48:03.338 --> 01:48:03.719]  Win-win.
[01:48:04.219 --> 01:48:06.260]  I drink nothing but high-quality filter water.
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:07.861]  You can't trust most of the bottled water.
[01:48:08.181 --> 01:48:10.543]  ProPure G2 cuts out almost all the fluoride.
[01:48:10.883 --> 01:48:13.225]  Almost nothing out there cuts 100% out, but it cuts out.
[01:48:13.525 --> 01:48:18.228]  We've got the tests all listed from where we had them tested on Infowars, store.com.
[01:48:18.368 --> 01:48:19.509]  It's like 99 point something.
[01:48:19.969 --> 01:48:21.951]  And you just see hundreds of chemicals and things.
[01:48:21.971 --> 01:48:21.951]  99.9, 99.7, 99.999, 100.
[01:48:27.074 --> 01:48:33.556]  I mean, you know, it just reduces it almost down to nothing with this gravity-fed systems.
[01:48:34.037 --> 01:48:40.119]  And we've got a whole other line of clearly filtered, you know, it only cuts out like 98, 97, depending on which filter you get.
[01:48:41.659 --> 01:48:45.441]  Reverse osmosis only gets out 99%, but cuts out all the good minerals and stuff you need.
[01:48:45.861 --> 01:48:47.221]  And I still use that for cooking.
[01:48:47.501 --> 01:48:48.522]  So I do a mix of things.
[01:48:49.744 --> 01:48:53.046]  I do some high-quality bottled water that's from Arkansas.
[01:48:53.086 --> 01:48:55.227]  I know nothing's been done to it to get minerals.
[01:48:55.507 --> 01:48:56.508]  The point is, do a mix.
[01:48:56.628 --> 01:48:58.709]  In my view, I've done research with doctors and others.
[01:48:59.550 --> 01:49:04.192]  It is so important to get the filters at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:49:04.492 --> 01:49:05.773]  They're massively discounted.
[01:49:06.353 --> 01:49:08.955]  Promo code WATER at checkout.
[01:49:08.975 --> 01:49:09.275]  10% off.
[01:49:09.315 --> 01:49:10.896]  They're already lowest prices out there.
[01:49:11.216 --> 01:49:12.357]  And you fund our operation.
[01:49:12.397 --> 01:49:13.858]  But you are insane.
[01:49:15.262 --> 01:49:19.807]  If you are drinking unfiltered water, you are crazy.
[01:49:20.447 --> 01:49:21.488]  You are crazy.
[01:49:22.349 --> 01:49:23.811]  You are crazy, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:23.891 --> 01:49:30.117]  I mean, the glyphosates, the herbicides, the pesticides, all the garbage that's in there, you need to go to InfoWarStore.com.
[01:49:30.938 --> 01:49:36.364]  Start doing the right thing for your family, get a great price, get a high-quality system, and support our broadcast.

[01:49:41.743 --> 01:49:45.826]  And they can answer all your questions when you call up to 6 o'clock at night.
[01:49:45.927 --> 01:49:48.869]  It's the InfoWars folks, and after that it's the answering service.
[01:49:48.909 --> 01:49:50.270]  They do a great job as well.
[01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:53.413]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:49:53.433 --> 01:49:54.734]  Briefly on the gun thing...
[01:49:59.577 --> 01:50:04.059]  I will call in tomorrow when I'm driving back to Austin and get into this more.
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:06.201]  I'm going to do audio Skype when I drive through San Antonio.
[01:50:06.221 --> 01:50:07.321]  It's a pretty good connection there.
[01:50:07.341 --> 01:50:10.023]  So I'll pop in sometime tomorrow when I get up that way.
[01:50:10.963 --> 01:50:13.545]  But David can talk about it as well.
[01:50:14.825 --> 01:50:16.386]  But it is just not true.
[01:50:16.446 --> 01:50:17.287]  I've got it here on my stack.
[01:50:17.307 --> 01:50:17.867]  Let me find it.
[01:50:18.627 --> 01:50:19.568]  It is not true.
[01:50:19.588 --> 01:50:21.929]  And I'm not attacking the folks that put this out.
[01:50:21.969 --> 01:50:22.830]  It's just not accurate.
[01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:24.711]  The ATF has put out a tweet.
[01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:28.062]  Saying, you spoke, we listened.
[01:50:28.844 --> 01:50:33.651]  ATF HQ plans more study on proposed ammo ban exemption framework.
[01:50:35.188 --> 01:50:38.550]  ATF waves white flag, kills Air 15 bullet man in big win.
[01:50:38.610 --> 01:50:41.872]  No, they know the psychological warfare algorithm of the U.S.
[01:50:42.353 --> 01:50:50.538]  Old-timey fighters, I don't care what was the Zulus or it was the Scots, as British did studies on both groups, they found the more you fought them and killed them, the more they fought.
[01:50:50.918 --> 01:50:51.678]  Just didn't break them.
[01:50:52.319 --> 01:50:55.361]  They understood it was a long-term fight towards Washington.
[01:50:55.381 --> 01:50:57.242]  Hardly ever won a battle, but fought for seven years, won.
[01:50:58.407 --> 01:51:00.268]  They're just letting our opposition break up.
[01:51:00.608 --> 01:51:01.709]  They're going to come back with it.
[01:51:02.049 --> 01:51:02.589]  You watch.
[01:51:02.689 --> 01:51:03.810]  The fight is still continuing.
[01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:04.691]  They're coming for the guns.
[01:51:04.911 --> 01:51:05.671]  David Knight coming up.

[01:51:40.299 --> 01:51:41.959]  Right now, you heard about Bitcoins.
[01:51:42.059 --> 01:51:45.440]  But did you know that over 65,000 businesses accept Bitcoins?
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:51.682]  Listen, if you're already earning Bitcoins or trying to make money in the Bitcoin market, you've got to know BidBit.co.

[01:52:10.290 --> 01:52:10.850]  Hear that?
[01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:15.792]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:52:16.892 --> 01:52:19.272]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[01:54:19.904 --> 01:54:22.166]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:22.186 --> 01:54:24.748]  I'm David Knight, here in the InfoWars news studio in Austin.
[01:54:24.808 --> 01:54:26.529]  We're going to go to John Bowne's report.
[01:54:26.589 --> 01:54:29.491]  If you go to our website, you'll see a graphic up there.
[01:54:44.162 --> 01:54:47.183]  With a quote from Hillary Clinton, we are losing, it says.
[01:54:47.203 --> 01:54:50.504]  And there's a picture of Hillary Clinton with a photoshopped Pinocchio nose.
[01:54:50.544 --> 01:54:57.347]  I'm sure if she had a real Pinocchio nose, she would say, it's not a Pinocchio nose, I'm not lying, it's just I'm rehearsing for the role of Cyrano de Bergerac.
[01:54:58.305 --> 01:54:59.065]  But she is losing.
[01:54:59.445 --> 01:55:15.251]  She knows that they're losing and one of the biggest losses yesterday happened as she's giving her long speech at the UN defending her practices of having a private email server located in her home because it was more convenient.
[01:55:15.811 --> 01:55:18.752]  Yeah, more convenient to escape scrutiny.
[01:55:19.032 --> 01:55:23.814]  Now while she was talking about that and she goes on to say, and you know I get all these emails from Bill all the time.
[01:55:24.934 --> 01:55:27.635]  Just before that happened, just before she said it,
[01:55:28.769 --> 01:55:42.498]  The Wall Street Journal was talking to his spokesperson, and the spokesperson said this, the former president, Bill Clinton, who does regularly use Twitter, has sent a grand total of two emails during his entire life.
[01:55:43.179 --> 01:55:47.062]  Both of those as president, said his spokesman, Matt McKenna.
[01:55:47.782 --> 01:55:51.605]  After leaving office, Mr. Clinton established his own domain that staff use, he said.
[01:55:52.086 --> 01:55:55.388]  But Mr. Clinton still doesn't use email himself.
[01:55:55.508 --> 01:55:56.349]  It was very interesting.
[01:55:56.389 --> 01:56:01.493]  I saw that right away on Fox News when they came back after broadcasting her speech.
[01:56:01.794 --> 01:56:04.696]  And the reporter who was on the beat said that, pointed that out right away.
[01:56:04.716 --> 01:56:11.542]  And of course, Shepard Smith was in the studio and he said, yeah, but, you know, well, he's trying to defend Hillary Clinton, Shepard Smith was, he says.
[01:56:12.202 --> 01:56:17.067]  Well, maybe Bill Clinton doesn't send any emails, but maybe he was getting all these emails from Hillary Clinton.
[01:56:17.107 --> 01:56:17.867]  It's like baloney.
[01:56:18.048 --> 01:56:20.430]  You either use email or you don't use email.
[01:56:20.450 --> 01:56:23.132]  You don't need to try to defend the Clintons.
[01:56:23.172 --> 01:56:27.977]  But it just illustrates, as they always say, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.
[01:56:28.597 --> 01:56:29.118]  There you go.
[01:56:29.178 --> 01:56:30.119]  That's Hillary Clinton.
[01:56:30.439 --> 01:56:31.900]  Let's go to John Bowne's report on this.
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:35.123]  She's trying to flush her past down the memory hole.
[01:56:35.384 --> 01:56:35.864]  Won't work.
[01:56:35.904 --> 01:56:36.825]  Here's John Bowne's report.
[01:56:54.684 --> 01:57:04.988]  Hillary Rodham Clinton, mystery woman, first First Lady to be under criminal investigation, inundated by scandals from Little Rock, Arkansas to Washington, D.C.
[01:57:05.449 --> 01:57:20.375]  The Clintons squeaked by Kenneth Starr's lengthy investigation into what is now known as the Whitewater scandal, a shady real estate deal the Clintons were never prosecuted for, although their associates were convicted of federal fraud and conspiracy charges.
[01:57:20.615 --> 01:57:29.463]  During the first year of Bill Clinton's tenure in the White House, they fired seven employees with the White House travel office in order to reward their friends with jobs.
[01:57:29.944 --> 01:57:45.579]  Travelgate erupted, and the Clinton's personal lawyer and deputy White House counsel, a man Hillary regularly abused, supposedly committed suicide over having to testify knowing full well all of Hillary's devious secret pathways to power.
[01:57:45.839 --> 01:57:59.003]  Hillary lied under oath to the Office of Independent Counsel, claiming the last time she spoke with Foster was before Father's Day, when in fact Vince Foster's assistant had seen her with Foster four times after that date.
[01:57:59.403 --> 01:58:06.825]  Patrick Knowlton, an eyewitness, saw men in red vests fleeing the area before Foster's body was discovered.
[01:58:07.165 --> 01:58:08.565]  Fast forward to today.
[01:58:08.745 --> 01:58:14.607]  Hillary's private emails were all transmitted on a private server registered to her home in Chippewa,
[01:58:14.827 --> 01:58:24.557]  New York while she was acting as a Secretary of State that oversaw the overthrow of Gaddafi, the Syrian civil war, the turmoil in Egypt, and the Benghazi scandal.
[01:58:24.918 --> 01:58:34.208]  Ironically, President Obama signed a law last November that requires government officials to direct their official correspondence through private email to a government account.
[01:58:34.808 --> 01:58:38.871]  Earlier today, Hillary gave a speech about women's rights at the United Nations.
[01:58:39.111 --> 01:58:46.076]  Hillary addressed her Globalist New World Order cohorts from a room in the United States where press freedom is heavily restricted.
[01:58:46.296 --> 01:58:50.559]  Okay, that's all the time we've got for that now, but you can see that on top of the page at Infowars.com.
[01:58:50.859 --> 01:58:54.262]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:54.282 --> 01:58:56.143]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:00.276 --> 01:59:01.497]  Another major health threat.
[01:59:01.517 --> 01:59:06.419]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:59:06.499 --> 01:59:09.140]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:15.943]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:59:16.223 --> 01:59:19.064]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:59:19.224 --> 01:59:22.146]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:59:22.166 --> 01:59:24.167]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:59:24.187 --> 01:59:27.028]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:59:27.108 --> 01:59:32.610]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:36.311]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:59:36.331 --> 01:59:39.332]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:59:39.432 --> 01:59:46.514]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:59:56.877 --> 01:59:58.418]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:16.209 --> 02:00:20.394]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:21.054 --> 02:00:21.855]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.636 --> 02:00:23.537]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.178 --> 02:00:27.802]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.382 --> 02:00:32.427]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.306 --> 02:00:35.607]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:35.727 --> 02:00:38.608]  I'm David Knight, and we've got a lot of news to cover in this hour.
[02:00:38.628 --> 02:00:41.410]  We'll probably take some of your calls towards the bottom of the hour as well.
[02:00:41.950 --> 02:00:53.636]  And of course, as Alex Jones pointed out in the last half hour when he was with us, when the ATF walked away from this framework to start banning ammunition, and that's what they're trying to do.
[02:00:53.656 --> 02:01:00.419]  They're trying to come up, the framework is a rationalization to ban particular types of ammunition.
[02:01:00.999 --> 02:01:10.048]  And once they create this quote-unquote framework, they're going to come after every kind of ammunition one by one, but they backed off this particular time.
[02:01:10.108 --> 02:01:13.851]  The opposition was overwhelming, so they backed off early.
[02:01:13.891 --> 02:01:23.661]  They had till the 16th to take comments, and they've already shut this thing down, said, we're going to go back, we're going to take another look at this, and we'll come back with something that's more responsible, but we're listening to you.
[02:01:24.468 --> 02:01:30.233]  They want to try to placate people, as Alex Jones said, but of course they are going to be back, and we need to get even tougher with them next time.
[02:01:30.513 --> 02:01:43.325]  The price of liberty is eternal vigilance, and this time everybody was vigilant, everybody responded en masse, and we can back down the government if we do that consistently, but understand the government is also going to come back.
[02:01:43.645 --> 02:01:51.552]  And of course in the last segment we were just playing John Bowne's report, which you can see at the top of Infowars.com, as well as on our YouTube channel.
[02:01:53.004 --> 02:01:56.006]  Talking about Hillary Clinton trying to run from her past.
[02:01:56.046 --> 02:01:58.829]  She's trying to flush these emails down the memory hole.
[02:01:59.930 --> 02:02:04.914]  Very, very amusing to watch her get caught red-handed in a lie.
[02:02:05.334 --> 02:02:15.682]  Just as one story is coming out from the Wall Street Journal saying that Bill Clinton has never ever used emails, he's done twice, and they named the two times, said only within his presidency.
[02:02:15.882 --> 02:02:19.485]  She's saying that she needs this private server to communicate with Bill Clinton.
[02:02:19.525 --> 02:02:20.326]  It's like, yeah, right.
[02:02:21.212 --> 02:02:25.634]  And of course, you've got people like Montel Williams who can't be bothered to look at that.
[02:02:25.674 --> 02:02:27.234]  Instead, he's going to go after Alex Jones.
[02:02:27.835 --> 02:02:29.815]  But there's a lot of commentary about this.
[02:02:29.855 --> 02:02:37.398]  Of course, one of the things that happened as she was fielding questions from people, she refused to answer really the toughest questions.
[02:02:37.458 --> 02:02:42.040]  This is an article on WorldNetDaily talking about Matt Drudge and what he tweeted out.
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:44.241]  He said, Hillary totally effed it up.
[02:02:44.861 --> 02:02:45.462]  Yes, she did.
[02:02:45.942 --> 02:02:47.503]  She got caught red-handed yesterday.
[02:02:47.803 --> 02:02:49.925]  But she refused to answer the three toughest questions.
[02:02:49.965 --> 02:02:52.026]  Here's the questions that she would not answer.
[02:02:52.046 --> 02:02:57.250]  Number one, would she have an independent arbiter look at her private email server?
[02:02:57.750 --> 02:02:57.970]  No.
[02:02:58.190 --> 02:03:03.294]  She's just going to send these things out and tell us that she's disclosed everything.
[02:03:03.354 --> 02:03:04.755]  We'll just have to take her word for it.
[02:03:04.795 --> 02:03:09.919]  Number two, what links would she go to to prove that she did not delete emails?
[02:03:10.922 --> 02:03:13.726]  Again, we'll just have to take her word on it because she's so trustworthy.
[02:03:13.967 --> 02:03:16.230]  We got caught red-handed in a lie yesterday.
[02:03:23.786 --> 02:03:25.706]  And of course, the answer to that is no.
[02:03:26.067 --> 02:03:28.287]  Everybody knows what this woman is about.
[02:03:28.407 --> 02:03:31.028]  Saturday Night Live also commented on it.
[02:03:31.108 --> 02:03:36.329]  Not only Matt Drudge, but Saturday Night Live had something on Hillary Clinton and the email controversy.
[02:03:36.809 --> 02:03:38.029]  This was up on CNN.
[02:03:38.069 --> 02:03:40.530]  We're not going to play the video for you, but this is what they said.
[02:03:40.950 --> 02:03:47.471]  They had somebody impersonating Hillary Clinton, and the actor said, those emails are as clean as a whistle.
[02:03:47.591 --> 02:03:49.912]  This is not how Hillary Clinton goes down.
[02:03:50.652 --> 02:03:58.156]  And it was an actress named McKinnon and they said her wild-eyed Clinton said, laughing at the idea that the emails would be her undoing.
[02:03:58.176 --> 02:03:58.637]  Yeah.
[02:03:59.944 --> 02:04:00.464]  Exactly.
[02:04:00.564 --> 02:04:03.346]  This is the candidate of the big bankers.
[02:04:03.426 --> 02:04:06.767]  This is the candidate of the military-industrial complex.
[02:04:06.807 --> 02:04:23.755]  This is the woman who is saying that she is standing up for women's rights, giving a speech at the United Nations yesterday about women's rights, while she's taking massive amounts of money from the most oppressive regimes against all human rights, but particularly against women, singling out women.
[02:04:23.795 --> 02:04:26.716]  These oppressive Islamic regimes that attack women,
[02:04:28.812 --> 02:04:33.453]  Unbelievable what they do to women and of course she takes massive amounts of money from them.
[02:04:33.513 --> 02:04:35.373]  She's going to be in their pocket.
[02:04:35.934 --> 02:04:39.294]  An election is an advanced auction of stolen goods.
[02:04:39.454 --> 02:04:47.736]  She's going to be stealing those goods from you and she's going to be handing them to Saudi Arabia, to Bahrain, to these other people that she's taking massive amounts of money to.
[02:04:47.936 --> 02:04:50.537]  She's also going to be handing it to the bankers.
[02:04:51.317 --> 02:04:56.901]  And when we come back, I'm going to give you proof that the bankers are starting wars.
[02:04:56.961 --> 02:05:03.746]  We're going to talk about Obama's executive order declaring Venezuela a security threat to the United States and what's behind that.
[02:05:03.766 --> 02:05:04.687]  The bankers.
[02:05:04.707 --> 02:05:05.087]  Stay with us.
[02:05:05.107 --> 02:05:05.608]  We'll be right back.

[02:05:45.443 --> 02:05:49.026]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:05:49.366 --> 02:05:55.673]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:05:56.014 --> 02:06:00.979]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[02:06:40.031 --> 02:06:43.533]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:06:43.693 --> 02:06:47.656]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:06:47.976 --> 02:06:49.437]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:06:49.758 --> 02:06:57.343]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[02:07:29.326 --> 02:07:35.289]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients.
[02:07:35.509 --> 02:07:39.551]  Oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.

[02:08:11.533 --> 02:08:16.605]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:16.966 --> 02:08:19.252]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:23.146 --> 02:08:25.468]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:25.488 --> 02:08:29.072]  I'm David Nisen, studio, March 11th, 2015.
[02:08:29.112 --> 02:08:33.696]  Of course, we've been talking in the last hour to Alex Jones, who is on the road.
[02:08:33.716 --> 02:08:35.217]  He came in and hosted the last hour.
[02:08:35.918 --> 02:08:44.046]  We have had a victory, and I'll call it a victory, when the ATF backs down five days early from their proposed ammunition ban.
[02:08:44.821 --> 02:08:46.502]  It's just a victory in a battle.
[02:08:46.642 --> 02:08:48.163]  It's not a victory in the war.
[02:08:48.223 --> 02:08:49.044]  The war is not over.
[02:08:49.744 --> 02:08:57.969]  The war against the Second Amendment, against all of our God-given rights that are guaranteed in the Constitution, that war will continue.
[02:08:57.989 --> 02:08:59.150]  We can't rest on our laurels.
[02:08:59.930 --> 02:09:02.312]  The price of liberty, of course, is eternal vigilance.
[02:09:03.260 --> 02:09:05.001]  Look at the way this kind of unfolded, too.
[02:09:05.041 --> 02:09:06.722]  There's a good article we cover.
[02:09:06.762 --> 02:09:08.903]  We have an article up on Infowars.com.
[02:09:08.963 --> 02:09:09.664]  Steve Watson.
[02:09:09.684 --> 02:09:12.566]  There's also an article I talked about earlier from Gun Owners of America.
[02:09:12.586 --> 02:09:21.091]  And they said, of course, gun owners had until March the 16th to send comments to the ATF about the banning of AR-15 ammunition.
[02:09:21.511 --> 02:09:24.533]  But of course, they learned that it had already been banned.
[02:09:24.673 --> 02:09:29.755]  When we saw the regulations there, because they had removed the exemption of that ammunition.
[02:09:29.815 --> 02:09:34.196]  Back in 1986, they passed a law saying they were going to protect the police.
[02:09:34.216 --> 02:09:38.958]  That was a justification for it, but it was basically a gun control measure, an incremental gun control measure.
[02:09:38.978 --> 02:09:40.118]  That's the way they do all these things.
[02:09:40.558 --> 02:09:45.900]  They said, the following things are banned, but we're going to exclude, and then they specifically excluded things.
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:47.721]  That's the way our government operates, of course, right?
[02:09:47.741 --> 02:09:52.782]  That's why you don't have rights, but you have privileges that are granted to you by the government.
[02:09:52.822 --> 02:09:53.783]  That's the way they maintain it.
[02:09:54.502 --> 02:09:58.063]  They say that everything is prohibited unless expressly permitted.
[02:09:58.963 --> 02:10:04.905]  And so what they did was they said, well, everything is, you know, is prohibited, but we're going to expressly permit.
[02:10:04.945 --> 02:10:06.825]  And then they had AR-15 ammunition.
[02:10:06.845 --> 02:10:09.766]  Well, they removed that from their new regulations.
[02:10:10.406 --> 02:10:18.849]  When people noticed that and pointed it out, they'd say, hey, you've got a comment period that's not supposed to end until March 16th, but you published regulations that have already removed that exemption.
[02:10:18.869 --> 02:10:20.329]  You've already banned it.
[02:10:21.269 --> 02:10:23.750]  And they said, oh, that was just a publishing error.
[02:10:25.461 --> 02:10:31.665]  The error was in putting, not in publishing it, but the error was in telling people what they were going to do ahead of time.
[02:10:31.705 --> 02:10:33.006]  And that might have been a publishing error.
[02:10:33.026 --> 02:10:40.071]  Maybe the people at the printers didn't get the notice that they were supposed to hold that for a little bit longer before they put it out.
[02:10:40.979 --> 02:10:43.240]  It's that kind of deception that they're going to come back with.
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:53.865]  And so the war is not over, but we have won a battle, and we should celebrate that victory, and we should learn from that, that if we speak up, en masse, we can shut these people down, just as we were talking about it yesterday.
[02:10:54.285 --> 02:10:57.246]  That's what happened at the Bundy Ranch, and that was just one incident.
[02:10:57.826 --> 02:10:58.987]  And again, they come back again.
[02:10:59.967 --> 02:11:03.289]  It's not going to stop it, but it's the way we push this thing back.
[02:11:03.329 --> 02:11:05.630]  Now I said, as we were talking about Hillary Clinton,
[02:11:06.860 --> 02:11:09.283]  And about the lie that she caught in yesterday, of course.
[02:11:09.383 --> 02:11:14.448]  She is the candidate that the big money is lining up behind on the Democrat side.
[02:11:14.488 --> 02:11:18.112]  Of course, on the Republican side, the big money is lining up behind Jeb Bush.
[02:11:18.592 --> 02:11:21.576]  An election is an advanced auction of stolen goods, as H.L.
[02:11:21.596 --> 02:11:22.056]  Meekins said.
[02:11:22.076 --> 02:11:23.598]  They're going to steal the money from you.
[02:11:23.618 --> 02:11:24.799]  They're going to hand it to the bankers.
[02:11:24.819 --> 02:11:26.901]  They're going to hand it to the military-industrial complex.
[02:11:26.921 --> 02:11:28.162]  That's why they're pushing for wars.
[02:11:29.329 --> 02:11:38.613]  We had a report yesterday on Infowars.com, CurtinMO, Obama signs executive order declaring that Venezuela is a national security threat.
[02:11:40.134 --> 02:11:44.035]  How is Venezuela a national security threat, you might ask?
[02:11:45.056 --> 02:11:46.897]  Do they have intercontinental ballistic missiles?
[02:11:47.157 --> 02:11:47.357]  No.
[02:11:48.157 --> 02:11:49.478]  Do they have a massive air force?
[02:11:49.558 --> 02:11:49.738]  No.
[02:11:50.378 --> 02:11:53.320]  Do they have a massive army or navy that they could invade us with?
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:53.880]  No.
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:55.681]  Can they feed their people?
[02:11:56.241 --> 02:11:56.401]  No.
[02:11:57.383 --> 02:11:58.724]  They can't even feed their people.
[02:11:58.984 --> 02:12:00.244]  They don't even have water.
[02:12:00.384 --> 02:12:03.125]  They have to go across the border to get food and water.
[02:12:03.165 --> 02:12:15.770]  That was a report from about a year ago from Bloomberg saying, even though they're having severe shortages of food and water and medicine in Venezuela, we can count on them to make good on their bonds.
[02:12:15.870 --> 02:12:18.351]  They've been a real good investment for Wall Street.
[02:12:18.411 --> 02:12:21.592]  We've gotten nearly 700% return on investment.
[02:12:21.892 --> 02:12:23.593]  That was what Bloomberg was saying a year ago.
[02:12:24.173 --> 02:12:25.334]  So when I looked at this, I thought,
[02:12:26.212 --> 02:12:29.774]  Obama says that Venezuela is a national security threat.
[02:12:30.735 --> 02:12:32.416]  How are they a national security threat?
[02:12:33.577 --> 02:12:40.082]  Hmm, maybe there's something about that 700% return on investment that isn't working out so good right now.
[02:12:41.302 --> 02:12:48.167]  I hadn't really been following what was going on with the Venezuelan bonds, and maybe you haven't been following it either, but here's what I found.
[02:12:48.227 --> 02:12:50.649]  In February 12th, Reuters had this headline.
[02:12:51.752 --> 02:12:54.314]  Hit hard in Venezuela, U.S.
[02:12:54.414 --> 02:12:56.916]  bond funds keep their nerve.
[02:12:57.617 --> 02:13:00.118]  And they say that what's happened is these U.S.
[02:13:00.899 --> 02:13:18.593]  Wall Street firms that have invested in Venezuela bonds, because of course they've been a really good investment, making 700% return from these communist leaders who are oppressing their people, not even capable of giving them food, water, or medicine, but they're giving a 700% return to the bankers on Wall Street.
[02:13:19.704 --> 02:13:26.226]  Those funds that invested heavily into that had seen a 30% decline in their bonds value.
[02:13:26.646 --> 02:13:28.186]  So that was affecting their portfolio.
[02:13:29.606 --> 02:13:31.947]  You know, they've always paid, but now these things are down 30%.
[02:13:32.527 --> 02:13:35.848]  Moody had downgraded Venezuela bonds in January.
[02:13:36.828 --> 02:13:43.230]  And the buzz on Wall Street is that they expect Venezuela to default on their bonds sometime this year.
[02:13:44.264 --> 02:13:49.467]  That would be about the time that I'm sure that Obama would come up with some justification to invade Venezuela.
[02:13:50.247 --> 02:13:54.350]  So he can collect on the debt for the bankers on Wall Street.
[02:13:55.290 --> 02:13:56.811]  Now there's another element to this as well.
[02:13:57.652 --> 02:13:59.253]  China is coming in.
[02:13:59.473 --> 02:14:05.696]  China has given 45 billion dollars in loans and bonds to the Venezuelan government over the last 10 years.
[02:14:05.837 --> 02:14:06.117]  Why?
[02:14:06.737 --> 02:14:10.739]  Because China needs oil and Venezuela has lots of it.
[02:14:10.759 --> 02:14:11.500]  That's all they've got.
[02:14:12.591 --> 02:14:13.372]  So that's going on.
[02:14:13.392 --> 02:14:14.752]  That's one dimension of it.
[02:14:14.832 --> 02:14:17.154]  But the other dimension of it is the bankers.
[02:14:17.194 --> 02:14:21.116]  And of course the bankers don't want to get shoved out by Chinese investors.
[02:14:22.457 --> 02:14:29.822]  They want to get that oil because that's the only thing that they can get from Venezuela to pay off these bonds that they've given them.
[02:14:29.902 --> 02:14:31.363]  So what does Obama do?
[02:14:32.163 --> 02:14:36.886]  For the bankers, he declares that Venezuela is a national security threat.
[02:14:37.987 --> 02:14:41.289]  And I don't hear anybody in the mainstream laughing about that.
[02:14:42.489 --> 02:14:43.710]  And you know, it's really not funny.
[02:14:43.890 --> 02:14:47.493]  I mean, it's absurd on the face of it, but that's the way we get into wars.
[02:14:47.533 --> 02:14:59.361]  We fight the wars for the bankers, for the military-industrial complex, and that's why you've got hundreds of billions of dollars going to the Clintons, to Hillary Clinton, and to Jeb Bush to run for president.
[02:14:59.601 --> 02:15:01.303]  They're protecting their investment.
[02:15:01.503 --> 02:15:09.248]  It's an advanced auction of stolen goods, and they're not just stealing goods, they're going to steal your sons' and your daughters' lives, and their futures.
[02:15:10.129 --> 02:15:11.030]  That's what they're going to steal.
[02:15:12.435 --> 02:15:26.569]  Now we've talked a lot about the surveillance state, and there's a lawsuit that has just come out from the ACLU, as well as Wikipedia, as well as someone else we've talked to, the Rutherford Institute has been a frequent guest here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:27.483 --> 02:15:34.352]  Suing the NSA and again the Department of Justice because you know the Department of Justice seems to always be involved in these criminal actions.
[02:15:34.492 --> 02:15:36.014]  It's always the DOJ.
[02:15:36.755 --> 02:15:40.660]  Even when we got Hillary Clinton with the email, we got Eric Holder.
[02:15:41.060 --> 02:15:42.782]  He also used email aliases.
[02:15:42.882 --> 02:15:43.803]  I don't think we can count
[02:15:44.504 --> 02:15:50.966]  On Eric Holder prosecuting Hillary Clinton, because usually the Department of Justice are partners in these crimes.
[02:15:51.006 --> 02:16:00.949]  That's why nobody's getting prosecuted, that's why nobody's going to jail for breaking the law, because the Department of Justice is partnering with this criminal activity, with these lawsuits.
[02:16:01.009 --> 02:16:02.949]  And we've got another story that illustrates that as well.
[02:16:03.409 --> 02:16:12.772]  But in this particular one, we've got now Wikipedia, ACLU, and others suing the NSA, saying that the NSA's dragnet surveillance violates our First Amendment.
[02:16:12.932 --> 02:16:13.533]  Well, yes it does.
[02:16:13.573 --> 02:16:17.856]  It also violates our Fourth Amendment, prying into our person places without a search warrant.
[02:16:17.876 --> 02:16:19.878]  To me, that's the more obvious connection.
[02:16:20.318 --> 02:16:21.939]  This is what Wikipedia said.
[02:16:21.959 --> 02:16:24.301]  They said, privacy is a bedrock of individual freedom.
[02:16:25.382 --> 02:16:33.549]  Principles that enable inquiry, dialogue, creation are central to Wikipedia's vision of empowering everyone to share in the sum of all human knowledge.
[02:16:33.589 --> 02:16:38.573]  In other words, what they're setting up is the basis for damages so that they can sue against this.
[02:16:39.679 --> 02:16:48.691]  Now, interestingly enough, this article from the New American points out the ACLU had attempted a lawsuit in 2013 against the NSA's warrantless wiretapping program.
[02:16:48.711 --> 02:16:49.292]  Look at this.
[02:16:49.953 --> 02:16:51.936]  But the Supreme Court rejected the case.
[02:16:52.076 --> 02:16:52.376]  Why?
[02:16:53.358 --> 02:16:57.103]  Because the plaintiffs couldn't provide sufficient proof they'd been spied on.
[02:16:57.674 --> 02:17:04.739]  How are you supposed to supply proof that you've been spied on when you can't get anything with a FOIA request?
[02:17:04.779 --> 02:17:06.841]  And if they send you something, everything is redacted.
[02:17:06.881 --> 02:17:15.547]  How do you prove that the East German police state has spied on you when the East German police state won't tell you what they've collected on you?
[02:17:15.667 --> 02:17:18.189]  I mean, this is absolute Kafkaesque.
[02:17:19.050 --> 02:17:19.630]  Oh, you know what?
[02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:22.212]  Look that up on Wikipedia while Wikipedia is still up.
[02:17:23.032 --> 02:17:24.292]  Find out about Kafka.
[02:17:24.533 --> 02:17:25.733]  Find out about the trial.
[02:17:26.513 --> 02:17:27.914]  Look that up on Wikipedia.
[02:17:27.934 --> 02:17:37.017]  While Wikipedia sues the ACLU, and the ACLU are suing the NSA, you know, they're not going to be able to roll that back, I'm afraid, but I hope they do.
[02:17:37.358 --> 02:17:41.779]  I mean, they have violated not only our First Amendment, but they violated our Fourth Amendment.
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:45.701]  And one of the ways they do it, of course, is with the Stingray Program.
[02:17:46.201 --> 02:17:49.185]  Where they set up these fake cell phone towers.
[02:17:49.226 --> 02:17:55.374]  This is one of the other things that I guess maybe the Montel Williams of the world want to scoff at about InfoWars.
[02:17:55.394 --> 02:17:57.457]  They say, hey, they got all these fake cell phone towers.
[02:17:57.477 --> 02:18:00.862]  We've been reporting on this for a couple of years, at least, since I've been here.
[02:18:01.403 --> 02:18:02.844]  Talking about the Stingray program.
[02:18:03.284 --> 02:18:06.307]  That is something that is a device that we've documented this.
[02:18:06.807 --> 02:18:16.454]  We've had different police departments be caught with FOIA requests, being caught in admissions that they are illegally spying in a dragnet manner on everybody with a cell phone.
[02:18:17.114 --> 02:18:24.920]  And of course we've even had situations where the police, in order to prosecute somebody, wanted to use evidence that they had collected without a search warrant.
[02:18:25.677 --> 02:18:37.284]  Without a search warrant, and we have to maintain due process even when we're going after criminals, or the government becomes criminal, and you have a much more dangerous situation than just individual freelance criminals out there.
[02:18:37.304 --> 02:18:41.826]  When they organize as criminals, you've got organized crime as a government.
[02:18:42.066 --> 02:18:44.828]  So we have to keep them to the due process.
[02:18:45.749 --> 02:18:51.452]  Without a search warrant, they had gotten this information through the Stingray program.
[02:18:51.492 --> 02:18:52.973]  They wanted to admit it into court.
[02:18:53.675 --> 02:19:04.224]  The defense lawyer protested against that and they wanted to see what this device was that they had and the police department refused to give it to the judge saying we have a non-disclosure agreement.
[02:19:04.745 --> 02:19:07.267]  And he says, you don't have a non-disclosure agreement with me.
[02:19:08.328 --> 02:19:13.452]  And so what they did was they let the criminal walk free because they would not show the information
[02:19:14.511 --> 02:19:14.671]  That
[02:19:35.742 --> 02:19:36.444]  We're good to go.
[02:19:47.009 --> 02:19:49.252]  If it's not that, then it works exactly that.
[02:19:49.372 --> 02:19:53.136]  Now we find out that the CIA has been behind this.
[02:19:53.736 --> 02:19:54.898]  And guess who they're working with?
[02:19:55.899 --> 02:19:56.499]  The U.S.
[02:19:56.599 --> 02:20:00.023]  Marshal Service, a division of the Department of Justice.
[02:20:00.063 --> 02:20:01.765]  We're going to talk about that as we come back.
[02:20:01.825 --> 02:20:06.970]  Now we've got the CIA and the Department of Justice violating the Constitution, violating your laws, spying on people.
[02:20:06.990 --> 02:20:07.831]  Dragnet, stay with us.
[02:20:07.851 --> 02:20:08.432]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:10.340 --> 02:20:11.400]  It's happening again.
[02:20:11.501 --> 02:20:14.702]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[02:20:15.122 --> 02:20:18.303]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[02:20:18.523 --> 02:20:22.344]  378, will take away your right to buy level 3 and higher body armor.

[02:24:11.463 --> 02:24:11.904]  I'm good.
[02:24:25.841 --> 02:24:29.563]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday, March 11, 2015.
[02:24:29.623 --> 02:24:30.264]  I'm David Knight.
[02:24:30.684 --> 02:24:32.205]  I'll be hosting the rest of this hour.
[02:24:32.225 --> 02:24:38.050]  I'm going to take your calls in the next segment after I go over a couple of more news articles I'd like to talk about.
[02:24:38.090 --> 02:24:39.491]  And we can talk about those news articles.
[02:24:39.511 --> 02:24:44.855]  We can talk about the ammo ban, the lawsuit by the ACLU and Wikipedia against the NSA.
[02:24:45.855 --> 02:24:47.156]  That number will be 800-259-9231.
[02:24:47.176 --> 02:24:47.977]  800-259-9231.
[02:24:48.257 --> 02:25:01.846]  If you want to comment on the news of the day, going back to the news, what I was just talking about before we went to commercial break, was now we see a CIA connection to the Stingray program.
[02:25:01.926 --> 02:25:09.731]  That is the cell phone towers that, well, the devices that mimic cell towers so they can scan data on your cell phones.
[02:25:10.232 --> 02:25:11.873]  They don't mention the term Stingray.
[02:25:11.913 --> 02:25:13.414]  This is a Wall Street Journal article.
[02:25:13.834 --> 02:25:14.795]  That's for you, Montel.
[02:25:15.575 --> 02:25:23.257]  This was on the Drudge Report, and although they don't describe Stingray, they describe the functions of Stingray that we've been reporting on for a couple of years now.
[02:25:23.977 --> 02:25:31.099]  That they would not turn over information in court to judges who question them on how they collected this information without a search warrant.
[02:25:31.439 --> 02:25:37.721]  They would just drop the charges rather than expose the program because they had a non-disclosure agreement with a corporation.
[02:25:37.781 --> 02:25:40.141]  And of course, corporations trump courts.
[02:25:40.261 --> 02:25:41.301]  They trump our government.
[02:25:41.341 --> 02:25:43.142]  They control our government.
[02:25:44.161 --> 02:25:48.123]  In this article, they say the CIA aided a program to spy on U.S.
[02:25:48.323 --> 02:25:48.743]  cell phones.
[02:25:48.763 --> 02:25:51.104]  So it's not just the NSA, it's the CIA.
[02:25:51.164 --> 02:25:58.007]  Remember, the CIA was only supposed to be operating abroad, protecting us from these monsters that are stalking us abroad.
[02:25:58.607 --> 02:26:08.311]  No, the CIA is the monster that has taken over our government domestically and is focusing, it's one of the many agencies that are focusing on people here domestically.
[02:26:08.691 --> 02:26:09.431]  This is what they did.
[02:26:09.471 --> 02:26:11.412]  Of course, this article exposes
[02:26:12.032 --> 02:26:17.739]  A secret high-tech alliance between the spy agency, the CIA, and domestic law enforcement.
[02:26:17.779 --> 02:26:22.384]  Who in domestic law enforcement are they making an alliance with secretly?
[02:26:23.325 --> 02:26:23.845]  The U.S.
[02:26:24.126 --> 02:26:27.590]  Marshals under the Justice Department.
[02:26:28.567 --> 02:26:35.150]  Now, of course, this is a digital dragnet, and as people have been talking about with the NSA spying, this is something different.
[02:26:35.170 --> 02:26:36.831]  This is not spying on you on the internet.
[02:26:36.871 --> 02:26:48.457]  This is spying on your cell phones and collecting data from your cell phones as you're driving around with these fake antennas that they have up, spoofing a cell phone tower so they can grab your information.
[02:26:48.917 --> 02:26:52.899]  And of course, the CIA is prohibited from acting domestically.
[02:26:53.948 --> 02:26:57.393]  Unless they're trying to get a foreign spy that happens to be domestically.
[02:26:57.793 --> 02:27:03.741]  But this is dragnet surveillance of all Americans being done by the CIA and the Justice Department.
[02:27:03.761 --> 02:27:05.844]  So don't expect anybody to go to jail.
[02:27:06.565 --> 02:27:09.609]  Because our government is the organized criminals here.
[02:27:10.916 --> 02:27:31.819]  Don't expect them to tell us the truth either when they deny that they've been doing certain aspects of this any more than you got the truth from James Clapper when Ron Wyden knew what he was doing, asked him pointedly, and you see him look down and rub his eyebrows because he can't even look Ron Wyden or the staff in the eye because he knows they all know the truth.
[02:27:32.259 --> 02:27:35.501]  And he knows that the truth is going to come out, and that was right before the Snowden leak.
[02:27:35.902 --> 02:27:42.286]  They said the Justice Department, which oversees the Marshals Service, would neither confirm nor deny the existence of such technology.
[02:27:42.986 --> 02:27:43.767]  What a surprise.
[02:27:43.787 --> 02:27:58.577]  The Wall Street Journal goes on to say to civil libertarians, the close involvement of America's premier international spy agency, the CIA, with domestic law enforcement arms shows how military and espionage techniques are now being used on U.S.
[02:27:58.617 --> 02:27:59.117]  citizens.
[02:27:59.137 --> 02:28:01.879]  Well, that's kind of a milquetoast way to put it.
[02:28:03.080 --> 02:28:05.642]  Nevertheless, this is, they break down the chronology.
[02:28:05.682 --> 02:28:08.043]  Around 2004 is when they started doing this.
[02:28:08.824 --> 02:28:13.527]  Doing it with just certain carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile at first.
[02:28:13.868 --> 02:28:23.054]  The CIA and the Marshall Service received more than one of the devices at no cost, even though it cost $300,000 normally to sell.
[02:28:23.595 --> 02:28:30.160]  They're just kind of seeding them with it, you know, Harris Semiconductor, the companies that supply this military industrial complex here.
[02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:31.581]  Here, have one on us.
[02:28:31.961 --> 02:28:34.763]  And if you like the way this works, we can sell you a lot more of these.
[02:28:34.783 --> 02:28:35.483]  That's the way they do it.
[02:28:36.064 --> 02:28:37.465]  They seed it that way.
[02:28:37.525 --> 02:28:47.472]  Then in 2008, the CIA arranged for the Marshals Service to receive without charge one of the new devices, now enhanced to get more carriers besides just AT&T and T-Mobile.
[02:28:47.512 --> 02:28:51.134]  That would pick up Verizon, Sprint, NexTel, all of them.
[02:28:51.494 --> 02:28:52.875]  That one is now going for $500,000.
[02:28:53.416 --> 02:28:55.097]  See what I said?
[02:28:55.637 --> 02:28:58.860]  Our freedoms are up for sale to the highest bidder.
[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:00.701]  That's the way it's happening.
[02:29:01.261 --> 02:29:03.823]  Look at what's going on, of course, in New York.
[02:29:03.883 --> 02:29:05.484]  We have an article up on Infowars.com.
[02:29:05.524 --> 02:29:10.146]  A New York City bill would let residents earn money by recording idling cars.
[02:29:10.206 --> 02:29:15.810]  Guys, pull this up and take a look at this picture of this woman, this councilwoman, Helen Rosenthal.
[02:29:16.350 --> 02:29:17.131]  Put that up there.
[02:29:17.271 --> 02:29:17.931]  Blow that up.
[02:29:18.131 --> 02:29:22.494]  This woman looks like she stepped right out of Saturday Night Live.
[02:29:22.914 --> 02:29:23.895]  Unbelievable.
[02:29:24.315 --> 02:29:26.337]  This woman is dressed the way she looks.
[02:29:26.417 --> 02:29:30.841]  I mean this is like a comedy stand-up routine that Saturday Night Live would look at.
[02:29:30.881 --> 02:29:39.189]  But this woman thinks it's a great idea for people to send videos of people who have their cars stopped but the engine is still running.
[02:29:39.609 --> 02:29:45.394]  Send those pictures to her and the people in New York City and they'll write up tickets and give you a commission.
[02:29:46.215 --> 02:29:48.358]  Hey, maybe they can solve the homeless problem.
[02:29:48.378 --> 02:29:49.319]  They can give them a career.
[02:29:49.599 --> 02:29:50.600]  Spying on motorists.
[02:29:50.921 --> 02:29:52.202]  Turn everybody into snitches.
[02:29:52.523 --> 02:29:54.625]  I'm going to talk about the way they push back on this.
[02:29:54.685 --> 02:29:59.210]  Someone has come back at the congressional level to push back against these kind of abuses.
[02:29:59.271 --> 02:29:59.671]  Stay with us.
[02:29:59.691 --> 02:30:00.432]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.933 --> 02:30:02.554]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.475 --> 02:30:06.159]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.285 --> 02:30:18.950]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[02:30:19.271 --> 02:30:29.277]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[02:30:29.797 --> 02:30:35.881]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:30:36.241 --> 02:30:42.384]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:30:42.624 --> 02:30:50.809]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[02:30:51.249 --> 02:30:54.051]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:30:54.311 --> 02:30:55.471]  No needles, no injections.
[02:30:55.851 --> 02:30:57.172]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:30:57.232 --> 02:30:58.153]  Try it for yourself.
[02:30:58.433 --> 02:30:59.413]  Discover the secret.
[02:30:59.774 --> 02:31:00.094]  Secret 12.
[02:31:00.854 --> 02:31:02.917]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[02:32:13.506 --> 02:32:21.532]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[02:33:13.078 --> 02:33:19.103]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:33:19.703 --> 02:33:22.686]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:28.092 --> 02:33:29.272]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:29.312 --> 02:33:31.453]  I'm David Knight, your host in this last half hour.
[02:33:31.473 --> 02:33:35.114]  We're going to take your calls and we're going to continue with this story.
[02:33:35.154 --> 02:33:41.615]  There's some more aspects of this idling bill that's in New York City that's going to come up.
[02:33:41.695 --> 02:33:45.816]  I guess we could say idling cars are the devil's handwork.
[02:33:46.196 --> 02:33:47.977]  That certainly is the opinion.
[02:33:47.997 --> 02:33:49.197]  And let's go back to this picture.
[02:33:49.917 --> 02:33:54.038]  Of this little socialist nerd, Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal.
[02:33:54.339 --> 02:33:56.299]  You know, I hate to pick on people's appearance, but I'm sorry.
[02:33:56.359 --> 02:34:05.342]  She looks exactly like somebody who's been raised all of her life by the nanny state, and now has become that spokesperson.
[02:34:05.362 --> 02:34:09.623]  I mean, this is like some character, like I said before, out of Saturday Night Live.
[02:34:10.384 --> 02:34:11.384]  We're going to talk about that.
[02:34:11.424 --> 02:34:16.766]  Before we go to that, of course, we have also pointed out earlier in the show
[02:34:17.881 --> 02:34:23.505]  That Newsweek is now talking about yet another aspect of the problems with fluoridation.
[02:34:24.126 --> 02:34:25.927]  It's not the first time this has been discovered.
[02:34:25.967 --> 02:34:30.531]  It is a new study, and the new study is very important, very strong in terms of its data.
[02:34:30.991 --> 02:34:38.217]  The only way, the only thing that the people who support fluoridation can talk about is the fact that, well, this is just one study.
[02:34:39.076 --> 02:34:41.778]  And I'm sure they will find a study that will find something else.
[02:34:41.798 --> 02:34:58.932]  You know, when they found the massive tumors on the rats in France after they fed them GMO for a couple of months, the industry funded its own study and fed the rats the GMO and didn't see the tumors because they stopped the study after a few weeks.
[02:34:59.253 --> 02:35:00.554]  It was much, much shorter than that.
[02:35:00.574 --> 02:35:06.339]  I don't remember whether it was months versus weeks or whether, but it was a much, much shorter truncated study.
[02:35:06.379 --> 02:35:07.540]  So they didn't see the tumors grow.
[02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:08.920]  That's what they'll do.
[02:35:08.980 --> 02:35:16.702]  They'll create a study to come back and try to push against this forwardation because we've been seeing these types of things popping up almost weekly.
[02:35:17.262 --> 02:35:20.643]  One from the UK a couple weeks ago talking about the damage to the thyroid.
[02:35:21.103 --> 02:35:30.065]  This one talking about, again, another mental effect, not a drop in IQ, but creating ADHD in people.
[02:35:30.845 --> 02:35:34.786]  That's why we sell things at the Infowars store like water filters.
[02:35:35.566 --> 02:35:40.930]  We're not selling you some snake oil water filter and trying to create a need for it by talking about fluoridation.
[02:35:41.330 --> 02:35:53.157]  We understand and have understood for a long time, as many of you have, fluoridation hurts your brain, it hurts your thyroid, it has measurable deleterious effects.
[02:35:53.217 --> 02:36:00.382]  There's no reason we should be mass medicating the public with anything where you can't control the dosage by dumping it into the water supply.
[02:36:00.442 --> 02:36:01.483]  So get that out.
[02:36:02.003 --> 02:36:03.124]  We understand that's a problem.
[02:36:03.684 --> 02:36:11.708]  We want to help you help yourself because you can't get the City Council to stop charging you to dump toxins into the water supply.
[02:36:12.148 --> 02:36:13.549]  Get your filter and take it out yourself.
[02:36:13.849 --> 02:36:15.289]  Protect yourself, protect your family.
[02:36:15.349 --> 02:36:17.731]  So we came up with some great water filters to sell.
[02:36:17.751 --> 02:36:18.931]  That's a win-win situation.
[02:36:18.951 --> 02:36:27.115]  It lets you take control of your life and it helps us be independent of the kind of pharmaceutical companies that run the mainstream media.
[02:36:27.435 --> 02:36:28.796]  That's why we have these things up there.
[02:36:29.216 --> 02:36:34.981]  Also at InfoWarsLife.com, we've got a 30% off unprecedented discount on DNA Force.
[02:36:35.541 --> 02:36:37.663]  Our competitors are already two to three times the price.
[02:36:37.683 --> 02:36:40.085]  Some are charging up to $600 for similar formulas.
[02:36:40.125 --> 02:36:43.687]  Right now, you can get DNA Force 30% off.
[02:36:43.847 --> 02:36:46.770]  That's under $100 for the first time ever.
[02:36:47.230 --> 02:36:49.472]  And that's at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:36:50.372 --> 02:36:54.215]  Now, I want to talk a little bit more about this story before we go to your calls.
[02:36:54.255 --> 02:36:55.617]  We've already got some people that have called in
[02:36:56.824 --> 02:37:09.682]  Uh, this New York City bill here that is going to turn people into snitches for profit by taking video of people who have their cars stopped and are idling and therefore they're using too much fuel.
[02:37:09.742 --> 02:37:10.883]  That's the rationale behind it.
[02:37:11.204 --> 02:37:12.545]  But of course they want to earn money.
[02:37:12.926 --> 02:37:14.248]  That's what the police are there for.
[02:37:14.668 --> 02:37:17.169]  They also want to shut down your cars.
[02:37:17.329 --> 02:37:23.490]  To them, nothing is more dangerous than a running car, so they have to be stopped by all means.
[02:37:23.791 --> 02:37:26.051]  Now, this is not something that is new, actually.
[02:37:26.551 --> 02:37:32.033]  Going back for a number of years, car companies have been starting to put these auto start-stop systems on their cars.
[02:37:32.973 --> 02:37:51.543]  I'm not ever going to buy one of these things, but they expect to see these on 60% of new vehicles by 2020, according to one article here, and this is from the Daily Tech, and they point out that these start-stop systems, basically, when you stop your car at a stoplight, it'll turn off your engine, and then when you get ready to go again, it'll turn the engine back on.
[02:37:52.343 --> 02:38:01.728]  That sounds like a losing idea from the very beginning for me, because I understand, as you should as well, that most of the wear and tear starts on your car as you're starting up the engine.
[02:38:02.768 --> 02:38:06.132]  It's also a massive drain on the battery and other issues.
[02:38:06.152 --> 02:38:12.600]  But of course, you can get that for a $300 option and you can be a good little green person.
[02:38:12.621 --> 02:38:17.346]  65% of the people in Europe now have these idiotic systems on their cars.
[02:38:17.366 --> 02:38:17.987]  7% in the U.S.
[02:38:18.027 --> 02:38:20.250]  They expect that to increase to 60% in the U.S.
[02:38:20.551 --> 02:38:20.691]  by 2020.
[02:38:21.892 --> 02:38:31.676]  Now, going back to 2011, the Truth About Cars pointed out in a very detailed analysis, and I'm not going to go into here, the shocking truth about start-stop systems.
[02:38:31.716 --> 02:38:37.579]  And they point out that the current generation, in terms of the fuel economy, they find out it's not really there.
[02:38:37.859 --> 02:38:38.820]  And it gets even worse.
[02:38:38.900 --> 02:38:46.023]  The current generation, they said, in 2011, of start-stop systems lose half of their benefits after just two weeks.
[02:38:46.843 --> 02:38:57.110]  Which means that they're great for juicing up the scores on Europe's urban efficiency test, but they're as good as useless for the vast majority of life as we live it in our vehicles.
[02:38:57.530 --> 02:39:01.373]  Now, what is behind all this, of course, is raising money.
[02:39:01.453 --> 02:39:06.036]  That's what our local governments, especially New York City, does all the time.
[02:39:06.756 --> 02:39:09.438]  And here's a bombshell piece of legislation that's coming.
[02:39:09.698 --> 02:39:11.319]  This is reported by the Free Thought Project.
[02:39:11.339 --> 02:39:12.680]  This has been introduced by a U.S.
[02:39:12.740 --> 02:39:13.801]  congressman from Missouri.
[02:39:14.501 --> 02:39:19.263]  Emmanuel Cleaver, on Monday he introduced something he calls the Fair Justice Act.
[02:39:19.723 --> 02:39:28.767]  And he says the Fair Justice Act would make it a criminal rights violation to enforce criminal or traffic laws for the purpose of raising revenue.
[02:39:29.467 --> 02:39:29.747]  Wow!
[02:39:30.167 --> 02:39:32.988]  That would pretty much put them out of business, wouldn't it?
[02:39:33.288 --> 02:39:34.589]  He says petty drug offenses.
[02:39:35.049 --> 02:39:42.434]  Idiotic traffic laws, this is a Free Thought Project talking about this, and other such victimless crimes could be brought to a halt with the passage of this bill.
[02:39:42.474 --> 02:39:58.525]  But we've already seen those kinds of things brought to a halt in New York City in protest of de Blasio, the mayor, not backing up the police when they were harassing Eric Garner and eventually killed him over a petty tax over tobacco.
[02:39:58.865 --> 02:39:59.826]  That's how that all started.
[02:39:59.846 --> 02:40:02.588]  They said, well, you're not going to enforce us when we're
[02:40:03.268 --> 02:40:06.449]  Out there strong-arming people to collect revenue for you.
[02:40:06.489 --> 02:40:14.092]  We're just going to stop making, as they put it, this is the police union talking, unnecessary arrests, unnecessary tickets.
[02:40:14.653 --> 02:40:17.774]  Yeah, let's stop them from doing things that aren't necessary.
[02:40:17.974 --> 02:40:22.496]  Let's stop them from killing people over a tobacco tax.
[02:40:22.676 --> 02:40:32.120]  And of course, the Free Thought Project goes on to say, since there's no money in solving murders or preventing rapes, police departments in America have focused their duties on traffic citations and the drug war.
[02:40:33.493 --> 02:40:36.660]  If you go back to New York City, as they protested...
[02:40:37.921 --> 02:40:40.362]  City Hall's not standing behind them.
[02:40:40.543 --> 02:40:46.346]  De Blasio criticizing them for going over the top and killing Eric Garner over this tobacco tax.
[02:40:46.726 --> 02:40:48.547]  They got angry, so they stopped doing that.
[02:40:49.207 --> 02:40:58.373]  They dropped the number of tickets that they were writing by 95%, costing the city, I think it was like $10 million a week, and they went through New Year's Eve.
[02:40:58.533 --> 02:41:03.856]  New Year's Eve, they didn't arrest anybody for drunkenness in Times Square, they just left people alone.
[02:41:04.776 --> 02:41:07.438]  And focused only on violent crimes.
[02:41:07.879 --> 02:41:09.120]  And they kept that up for a while.
[02:41:09.580 --> 02:41:21.330]  Now it's interesting to go back a few years, there was a famous whistleblower within the police in New York City, the NYPD, Adrian Schoolcraft, who over a period of years, this guy was a legitimate cop.
[02:41:21.730 --> 02:41:23.151]  He really wanted to protect people.
[02:41:23.231 --> 02:41:25.293]  He wanted to interact with the people on the beat.
[02:41:26.034 --> 02:41:30.638]  And he started, he refused to write these annoyance tickets to collect revenue.
[02:41:30.678 --> 02:41:32.360]  And so as punishment, they put him on the beat.
[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:34.041]  And he was very happy about that.
[02:41:34.362 --> 02:41:36.103]  Because he got to know the people in the community.
[02:41:36.584 --> 02:41:37.765]  And he wasn't harassing them.
[02:41:38.606 --> 02:41:40.187]  But they were not happy with him.
[02:41:40.247 --> 02:41:46.133]  And when they found out that he had been recording their meetings where they were putting pressure on the police to write these tickets,
[02:41:47.435 --> 02:41:58.942]  They came to his apartment and the number two guy in the New York Police Department threatened him, said, turn over these things or we're going to commit you for your own safety.
[02:41:59.242 --> 02:42:04.645]  They actually kidnapped him, put him into an insane asylum where his dad couldn't find him.
[02:42:04.685 --> 02:42:05.866]  His dad was a cop as well.
[02:42:06.166 --> 02:42:08.867]  His dad couldn't find him for about a week and then did find him.
[02:42:09.448 --> 02:42:12.049]  They lied to everybody and they said, we don't have any ticket quotas.
[02:42:12.129 --> 02:42:16.552]  And then they proved that they did have ticket quotas when they shut everything down this last winter.
[02:42:17.435 --> 02:42:24.717]  But they would take a whistle-blowing cop, an honest cop, who wants to protect the public, and they would put him in an insane asylum.
[02:42:25.257 --> 02:42:27.038]  That's the insanity of this.
[02:42:28.298 --> 02:42:29.619]  Let's go to your calls right now.
[02:42:29.639 --> 02:42:33.280]  Let's go to the first caller there on, that you got flashing right there.
[02:42:33.300 --> 02:42:34.060]  Sorry, what's his name?
[02:42:36.621 --> 02:42:37.621]  Yeah, JJ in Indiana.
[02:42:37.661 --> 02:42:37.981]  Go ahead.
[02:42:39.341 --> 02:42:39.982]  Oh, hi David.
[02:42:40.182 --> 02:42:43.323]  I was just wondering, do you think they actually enforced the TAMIL ban?
[02:42:43.343 --> 02:42:44.823]  What do you think we're facing after that?
[02:42:46.138 --> 02:42:48.723]  What do I think will come if they're successful in doing the ammo ban?
[02:42:49.885 --> 02:42:50.105]  Yeah.
[02:42:50.366 --> 02:42:51.989]  Like, what do you think is going to come out of it?
[02:42:52.309 --> 02:42:54.954]  Well, what they talked about was they want to create a framework.
[02:42:55.842 --> 02:43:14.300]  And in the letter that the 52 senators sent to the ATF, because it's not just 80,000 people angry at comments, but it was also 52 senators, they said that the ATF had essentially created a pseudo-objective standard.
[02:43:14.540 --> 02:43:18.044]  They said, you pretend to have an objective standard, but you don't really.
[02:43:18.684 --> 02:43:19.705]  Have an objective standard.
[02:43:20.565 --> 02:43:26.589]  And what they want to do is they want to say, well, we can say that the objective standard is if it kills a cop, we can ban it.
[02:43:28.516 --> 02:43:34.359]  The senator said, you're creating a framework to go after all ammunition because all ammunition could arguably be that.
[02:43:34.419 --> 02:43:42.842]  And unfortunately, the way that they wrote that, the senator said, you know, these are used for sporting purposes.
[02:43:43.303 --> 02:43:48.325]  And we have to understand that we're not going to be able to defend the Second Amendment by saying we need it for sporting purposes.
[02:43:49.065 --> 02:43:50.846]  That is a path to disaster.
[02:43:50.886 --> 02:43:54.328]  That was a path that the NRA took for many decades.
[02:43:54.368 --> 02:44:06.334]  Under Wayne LaPierre, they have taken a more constitutional approach, but we cannot take the approach that they're going to let us have the guns if we use them only for target practice and for hunting.
[02:44:06.454 --> 02:44:08.275]  That's not what the Second Amendment is about.
[02:44:08.335 --> 02:44:15.079]  That's a legitimate use of firearms, but that's not the main point of the citizens' right to keep and bear arms.
[02:44:15.119 --> 02:44:16.400]  So, they're going to come back.
[02:44:17.120 --> 02:44:21.083]  And I don't know how they're going to tweak this framework, but that's what they're talking about.
[02:44:21.103 --> 02:44:26.287]  They're going to basically try to create some kind of a structure that will let them incrementally ban ammunition.
[02:44:26.908 --> 02:44:27.048]  Thanks.
[02:44:27.068 --> 02:44:28.809]  Let's go to Sherry in Texas.
[02:44:28.829 --> 02:44:29.109]  Sherry?
[02:44:30.370 --> 02:44:30.891]  Thank you.
[02:44:31.511 --> 02:44:32.111]  Thank you, David.
[02:44:32.131 --> 02:44:34.253]  I wanted to say something about Hillary.
[02:44:34.273 --> 02:44:39.277]  I've been really concerned about this for a long time, and here's what I think she's facing.
[02:44:40.253 --> 02:44:41.115]  Can you hear me alright?
[02:44:41.135 --> 02:44:41.676]  Yes, yes, go ahead.
[02:44:41.736 --> 02:44:42.056]  Thank you.
[02:44:42.116 --> 02:44:44.621]  I've had my audio cut in the past and I never know.
[02:44:45.182 --> 02:44:46.605]  Okay, so here's the deal.
[02:44:46.965 --> 02:44:49.390]  The military industrial complex, I think,
[02:44:50.211 --> 02:45:01.793]  He wants to blame her for Benghazi and not the CIA or secret agents that were working for profit under the radar so that no other CIA agents knew about it.
[02:45:02.213 --> 02:45:08.374]  And the reason I say this is because there was a show on the radio on a late night show many of us know and love.
[02:45:08.794 --> 02:45:15.575]  It was on November 3, 2013 on a Sunday and I was too tired to stay up.
[02:45:16.496 --> 02:45:18.776]  This whistleblower named Robert
[02:45:19.056 --> 02:45:19.556]  Yeah, we've had him on.
[02:45:19.576 --> 02:45:22.058]  Alex has interviewed him multiple times talking about Benghazi.
[02:45:22.438 --> 02:45:23.079]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:45:23.119 --> 02:45:23.419]  Tosh Plumlee.
[02:45:43.294 --> 02:45:47.837]  And I think, well anyway, I turn on the light and started making notes.
[02:45:48.337 --> 02:45:55.621]  And what I, what has stuck with me from that interview and others is this, something about an interdiction program.
[02:45:55.921 --> 02:46:00.664]  He was, I don't know what that is, but after that he said, Reagan could have been impeached.
[02:46:01.044 --> 02:46:04.526]  We set up CIA operatives and the IRS busted them.
[02:46:04.826 --> 02:46:10.229]  That gun running was in violation of the Boland Amendment and all that stuff I don't understand either.
[02:46:10.709 --> 02:46:14.933]  Well, Tosh Plumlee was running, he was a pilot who was running stuff for the CIA.
[02:46:15.033 --> 02:46:19.838]  So he was, he knew about the weapons, the secret weapons transfers that were in violation of the law.
[02:46:20.339 --> 02:46:28.447]  He knew about the transference of cocaine from Central America that Gary Webb exposed in Dark Alliance.
[02:46:28.467 --> 02:46:30.189]  They used that, the CIA used that to
[02:46:30.749 --> 02:46:34.653]  Create the crack cocaine epidemic with Freeway Ricky Ross.
[02:46:34.673 --> 02:46:37.897]  So yeah, we have we've had Tosh Plumlee on several times.
[02:46:37.917 --> 02:46:47.046]  We had Freeway Ricky Ross in here talking about how that had gone down shortly after the movie came out about Gary Webb.
[02:46:48.128 --> 02:46:49.309]  Dark, let's see, what was it called?
[02:46:49.329 --> 02:46:49.990]  Shoot the Messenger.
[02:46:50.510 --> 02:46:52.092]  His book was called Dark Alliance.
[02:46:52.472 --> 02:46:52.993]  Absolutely.
[02:46:53.073 --> 02:46:54.073]  The CIA was involved.
[02:46:54.093 --> 02:46:57.216]  We've had Steve Pchenik on who's talking about the CIA involvement.
[02:46:57.236 --> 02:47:15.231]  Steve Pchenik was saying that what happened in Benghazi was two different branches of the intelligence service of the CIA, the military and the civilian sides of it, essentially at war with each other because they were disagreeing about how and who they were going to arm out of the insurgents over there.
[02:47:15.851 --> 02:47:19.032]  And of course, we know that we are arming the people in Libya.
[02:47:19.092 --> 02:47:23.713]  It's become a shopping mall for ISIS, for the Syrian rebels.
[02:47:24.314 --> 02:47:28.855]  We know that the CIA and the military-industrial complex is arming and training these people.
[02:47:29.355 --> 02:47:31.876]  That's how they're trying to foment these wars.
[02:47:31.936 --> 02:47:34.957]  And certainly, Hillary Clinton is just one part of it.
[02:47:35.037 --> 02:47:41.699]  But certainly, Sherry, you understand that Hillary Clinton is very much involved in the cover-up of Benghazi, don't you?
[02:47:42.672 --> 02:47:43.432]  Does she have a choice?
[02:47:43.532 --> 02:47:45.513]  I think the military- Yes, she has a choice.
[02:47:45.533 --> 02:47:47.253]  She doesn't have to lie.
[02:47:47.353 --> 02:47:47.653]  Yes.
[02:47:47.973 --> 02:47:54.115]  Well, see, the next day I thought if Reagan could have been impeached, he would have had to know something about it.
[02:47:54.415 --> 02:48:05.338]  But then, of course, as Plumley went on to explain, he said, we can't report some things like that because they have to protect the legacy of past presidents.
[02:48:05.358 --> 02:48:06.278]  Well, that was Reagan.
[02:48:06.598 --> 02:48:07.799]  They don't want to protect her.
[02:48:09.479 --> 02:48:11.780]  Her presidency, I don't think she's going to run because of this.
[02:48:11.820 --> 02:48:12.440]  I never did.
[02:48:12.780 --> 02:48:17.661]  If she does, she's going to be sure to lose because I think the complex wants to blame Hillary.
[02:48:17.941 --> 02:48:22.722]  They want to blame Benghazi on Hillary and not the CIA operatives or secret agents.
[02:48:23.062 --> 02:48:32.324]  And I noticed that Hillary quit that morning that that show was on, on 2013, if I'm not mistaken, that Monday because it was on a Sunday.
[02:48:32.344 --> 02:48:34.045]  I just have to say that, you know,
[02:48:34.805 --> 02:48:39.928]  Hillary Clinton is not an innocent bystander.
[02:48:39.989 --> 02:48:59.681]  If you want to get Hillary Clinton on lying, on money under the table, on people being suicided in Arkansas, going back to her record as being probably one of the most successful commodities investors ever, getting like a thousand percent return on her investment,
[02:49:00.882 --> 02:49:01.503]  I don't know.
[02:49:20.985 --> 02:49:22.446]  It's a target-rich environment.
[02:49:22.546 --> 02:49:24.927]  It goes way, way beyond Benghazi.
[02:49:25.387 --> 02:49:28.228]  And you can take a look at the money that she's getting.
[02:49:28.328 --> 02:49:32.010]  I think there's a very good chance, unfortunately, that she could become president.
[02:49:32.370 --> 02:49:36.932]  I think there's a very good chance that it will be her or Bush, Jeb Bush.
[02:49:37.012 --> 02:49:39.153]  And I think that's a very sad situation for our country.
[02:49:39.193 --> 02:49:41.354]  Let's go to Jeff in Tennessee.
[02:49:41.394 --> 02:49:41.634]  Jeff.
[02:49:43.615 --> 02:49:44.095]  Hi, David.
[02:49:44.275 --> 02:49:45.416]  Good to talk to you today.
[02:49:46.916 --> 02:49:48.257]  Just on the M.O.
[02:49:48.297 --> 02:49:48.517]  ban,
[02:49:49.392 --> 02:49:58.559]  Uh, you know, one of the things that really concerned me the first time I started seeing Green Tip 223 stuff come out was, why is that on the market?
[02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:05.444]  There's no other Green Tip ammo for .308 or .300 Magnum or .30 Ausfix.
[02:50:06.145 --> 02:50:06.885]  It's just .223.
[02:50:07.185 --> 02:50:14.311]  Now, I'm for all ammo being available, but it's almost... Yes, go ahead.
[02:50:15.523 --> 02:50:15.783]  Hello?
[02:50:16.844 --> 02:50:17.185]  Hello?
[02:50:17.405 --> 02:50:18.125]  I think we lost him.
[02:50:18.986 --> 02:50:19.627]  Can you hear me, Jeff?
[02:50:20.527 --> 02:50:21.348]  I think we've lost him.
[02:50:22.329 --> 02:50:24.271]  I'd like to know what he thought was up behind that.
[02:50:24.291 --> 02:50:28.875]  But you know, the bottom line is, is that he pointed out, I'm for all ammo being available.
[02:50:29.656 --> 02:50:32.518]  The right to keep and bear arms is not just about firearms.
[02:50:32.839 --> 02:50:33.960]  It's not just about rifles.
[02:50:33.980 --> 02:50:35.000]  It's about pistols.
[02:50:35.381 --> 02:50:40.806]  It's about the ammunition that you put in those, because then you wind up with a club if you don't have any ammunition for your gun.
[02:50:41.850 --> 02:50:43.131]  And that's the important thing.
[02:50:43.151 --> 02:50:52.477]  We have to understand the right to keep and bear arms is about everything that you're going to use to protect yourself against criminals, individual or collective, with the government.
[02:50:52.497 --> 02:50:52.857]  Stay with us.
[02:50:52.877 --> 02:50:53.598]  We're going to be right back.

[02:52:41.980 --> 02:52:46.543]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:52:46.783 --> 02:52:50.166]  The most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[02:52:50.587 --> 02:52:53.349]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[02:53:09.269 --> 02:53:09.949]  I'm Mike Huckabee.
[02:53:10.069 --> 02:53:14.371]  I was the Governor of Arkansas and Renfrew President in 2008, and I used to be a diabetic.
[02:53:14.491 --> 02:53:19.954]  One of the coolest campaigns I ever took on and won was the crusade that reversed my type 2 diabetes naturally.
[02:53:20.074 --> 02:53:25.016]  I was able to get off the medications I'd taken, and I lost 110 pounds of fat in the process.
[02:53:25.196 --> 02:53:31.679]  If you or someone you care about has type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, I urge you to pay close attention to what I'm about to tell you.

[02:53:59.926 --> 02:54:03.808]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:03.828 --> 02:54:05.429]  I'm David Knight.
[02:54:05.749 --> 02:54:19.677]  In this last segment, I want to get right to your calls.
[02:54:19.717 --> 02:54:22.219]  We've got a lot of people on hold.
[02:54:22.259 --> 02:54:24.420]  Let's go to Dave in New York.
[02:54:24.480 --> 02:54:25.080]  Dave, go ahead.
[02:54:25.961 --> 02:54:26.361]  Hey, Dave.
[02:54:27.091 --> 02:54:31.874]  Thanks for your stock market tip is buying stock and aftermarket car starters.
[02:54:33.554 --> 02:54:34.195]  Exactly.
[02:54:34.455 --> 02:54:34.735]  Yeah.
[02:54:34.795 --> 02:54:44.980]  I heard this morning, I didn't hear, I saw on the news scroll this morning, I believe it was ABC, but it mentioned, uh, and I hadn't heard the name Montel Williams in a long time until Alex said it.
[02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:47.702]  And, but then I saw this this morning, it's like two times in one day.
[02:54:47.742 --> 02:54:48.922]  This is like phenomenal.
[02:54:50.203 --> 02:54:53.785]  It said that he, uh, promotes or endorses some company that, uh,
[02:54:55.524 --> 02:54:59.205]  It has been found to charge up to a thousand percent interest.
[02:54:59.646 --> 02:54:59.846]  Wow.
[02:54:59.926 --> 02:55:06.428]  So I think we can find out just from that, you know, that obviously he is some type of a whore.
[02:55:06.448 --> 02:55:07.289]  I hate to use that word.
[02:55:07.449 --> 02:55:08.209]  Yeah.
[02:55:08.529 --> 02:55:20.974]  On a brighter side, I guess, Hillary Clinton back in, uh, it was a Watergate commission and she was put on the commission as a bright and upcoming college student or whatever she was at the time.
[02:55:21.514 --> 02:55:23.575]  But the guy that was the head of the commission said,
[02:55:24.184 --> 02:55:27.287]  She lies about stuff that doesn't deserve to be lied to.
[02:55:27.407 --> 02:55:28.908]  Just simple things.
[02:55:29.008 --> 02:55:29.929]  She lied about everything.
[02:55:30.149 --> 02:55:30.550]  Exactly.
[02:55:30.590 --> 02:55:31.991]  She's just pathological like that.
[02:55:32.031 --> 02:55:33.792]  And so is Bill, actually.
[02:55:33.812 --> 02:55:35.674]  So yeah, they're a good match in that respect.
[02:55:36.295 --> 02:55:41.299]  I think her, the big misunderstanding, I think her mother's name was Sir Edmund Hillary.
[02:55:43.587 --> 02:55:44.848]  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[02:55:44.949 --> 02:55:51.315]  It's just amazing to see when we have Montel Williams, who ignores the big stories.
[02:55:51.355 --> 02:55:54.037]  We've got some really serious stories going on.
[02:55:54.638 --> 02:55:56.279]  Even the story about Hillary Clinton.
[02:55:56.299 --> 02:55:57.421]  I mean, that's pretty amazing.
[02:55:57.481 --> 02:56:00.664]  When she goes up, she's got a prepared speech about how she needs this.
[02:56:02.205 --> 02:56:02.725]  I don't know.
[02:56:23.431 --> 02:56:34.482]  When we show yet another story, because there's been many of these that have come to light, most of them exposed by local news outlets like this particular one was about the VA's attitude towards veterans.
[02:56:34.662 --> 02:56:35.383]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:56:35.903 --> 02:56:36.484]  Thanks Dave.
[02:56:36.744 --> 02:56:39.507]  Let's go to a veteran, Roger in Missouri.
[02:56:39.607 --> 02:56:41.028]  Roger, you said you're a disabled vet.
[02:56:41.068 --> 02:56:42.450]  You just got a letter from the VA?
[02:56:44.432 --> 02:56:47.374]  Yes, they're trying to sneak another one in on us.
[02:56:48.544 --> 02:56:52.426]  I would advise all veterans not to fill this out and send it in.
[02:56:52.966 --> 02:56:55.467]  It's called the Million Veteran Program.
[02:56:56.848 --> 02:57:01.130]  And it's very nosy.
[02:57:01.750 --> 02:57:02.730]  Oh yeah, it's a survey?
[02:57:03.831 --> 02:57:10.774]  Yeah, this national program will study how genes, lifestyle, and military exposures affect health and illness.
[02:57:11.574 --> 02:57:13.655]  And they want you to come in and give a blood sample.
[02:57:16.451 --> 02:57:21.093]  It says you'll be anonymous, but I don't know, and they'll track you, I guess, for the rest of your life.
[02:57:21.393 --> 02:57:30.057]  Oh yeah, my policy is not to go to the doctor unless I got something that's broken, and I don't give information to the government unless they hold a gun to my head, and I think you ought to follow that advice.
[02:57:30.458 --> 02:57:33.939]  Any of the VA, any of the vets who get that letter from the VA, follow that same advice.
[02:57:33.979 --> 02:57:34.559]  Thank you, Roger.
[02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:37.241]  Let's go to Jeff in Missouri.
[02:57:37.401 --> 02:57:37.601]  Jeff?
[02:57:39.688 --> 02:57:40.669]  Hey, David, how's it going, bud?
[02:57:40.689 --> 02:57:41.530]  I know I'm short on time.
[02:57:41.550 --> 02:57:43.672]  Just wanted to say you're doing a great job when you sit in for Alex.
[02:57:43.732 --> 02:57:46.374]  It's always cool to hear somebody confident like yourself fill in.
[02:57:47.535 --> 02:57:50.818]  I just wanted to ask you, had you heard about, I think it was last week,
[02:57:51.483 --> 02:57:56.187]  Some congressman or senator said something about proposing getting rid of the ATF agency entirely.
[02:57:56.207 --> 02:57:58.829]  That was my first question.
[02:57:58.849 --> 02:58:02.312]  And then a comment, we have taken, I have taken kind of a page from you guys' book.
[02:58:02.752 --> 02:58:04.814]  We have produced a show here in Missouri called, or St.
[02:58:04.854 --> 02:58:06.856]  Louis, called The Hot Seat with Mark Bland.
[02:58:06.876 --> 02:58:08.797]  We produced two pilot episodes.
[02:58:08.817 --> 02:58:11.119]  The first one was on concealed carry and open carry law in Missouri.
[02:58:11.139 --> 02:58:12.880]  The second one was on cannabis laws in Missouri.
[02:58:12.900 --> 02:58:14.121]  That's great.
[02:58:14.141 --> 02:58:15.683]  And give us your website.
[02:58:15.703 --> 02:58:16.523]  How did they find that?
[02:58:17.344 --> 02:58:21.208]  The hot seat, the hot seat with Mark Blanton on YouTube, or you can go to about.me.
[02:58:21.749 --> 02:58:24.191]  That's our Instagram page.
[02:58:24.211 --> 02:58:24.752]  That's great.
[02:58:24.912 --> 02:58:26.734]  That's the way we take it, is at the local level.
[02:58:26.754 --> 02:58:28.215]  Sorry to cut you off, but we're out of time.
[02:58:28.255 --> 02:58:29.336]  And yes, we did talk about that.
[02:58:29.397 --> 02:58:31.278]  That was Congressman Sensenbrenner.
[02:58:32.059 --> 02:58:36.524]  We talked about whether it's a good thing to ban the ATF and to take its functions and send them to the FBI.
[02:58:36.824 --> 02:58:38.125]  The FBI and the DEA.
[02:58:38.465 --> 02:58:40.506]  I think it's good to go after these agencies.
[02:58:40.746 --> 02:58:41.367]  Cut their funding.
[02:58:41.627 --> 02:58:42.708]  Cut them out completely.
[02:58:42.828 --> 02:58:45.669]  Send a lesson to the other tyrants in Washington.
[02:58:45.989 --> 02:58:47.931]  Join us tonight, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
