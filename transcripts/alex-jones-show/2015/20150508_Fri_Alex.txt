[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:02.448]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:14.062 --> 00:00:14.703]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.384 --> 00:00:16.405]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.146 --> 00:00:18.247]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.908 --> 00:00:19.708]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:21.390]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:25.735]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.236 --> 00:00:30.301]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.076 --> 00:00:58.767]  Well now, the new Defense Secretary, Ash Carter, has quote, flatly denied in a press conference, and we're pulling that press conference in right now, or at a Pentagon briefing, that there is a takeover of Texas and Marshall Law Plant.
[00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:03.951]  What we said was, is that the feds are openly preparing the military for civil war.
[00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.580]  and gun confiscation and civil unrest.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.681]  That is in hundreds of news articles, hundreds of different public manuals.
[00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:23.164]  We link to them ad nauseam, so they come out and misrepresent that we're saying an imminent total takeover is happening in July and August.
[00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:25.025]  End of September.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.601]  And that is not the case.
[00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:41.287]  And they act like in the media that for just some crazy reason Chuck Norris, Governor Greg Abbott, Alex Jones, Senator Ted Cruz, are just imagining things are going on.
[00:01:41.607 --> 00:01:43.848]  Have you looked around at what's happening?
[00:01:43.888 --> 00:01:53.173]  The President is acting as a dictator, outside of law, not even with executive orders, deciding policy and law.
[00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.094]  And Congress isn't even challenging.
[00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:57.780]  And I'll tell you why Congress isn't challenging.
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.163]  Congress tells court that Congress can be investigated for insider trading.
[00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:18.330]  And what's happening is Congress has previously passed a law claiming that they're allowed to insider trade, but that other people aren't allowed.
[00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.733]  So again, Congress tells court that Congress can't be investigated for insider trading.
[00:02:25.273 --> 00:02:44.837]  My news article was printed, cut off, the T. A lot of my articles are printed with a little bit of stuff cut off, so I read can't, I thought, I mean can, I thought, well that's not right, they said can't, and I had to double take and go back, but Congress, imagine telling court that Congress can't be investigated for insider trading, kind of like
[00:02:47.714 --> 00:02:57.443]  The Obama administration says they can't be investigated for IRS gait or Benghazi gait or Fast and Furious gait or NSA gait.
[00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.226]  The list goes on and on and on.
[00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.075]  So that's all coming up today but just in one stack of news I was going through out of more than 20
[00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:15.900]  Just look at the atmosphere we're in.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.645]  Carter denies internet rumors no Texas takeover planned.
[00:03:23.087 --> 00:03:25.409]  But in the words of Jon Stewart, the takeover already happened.
[00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.934]  We're just pointing out the continued acclimation and conditioning.
[00:03:31.275 --> 00:03:32.316]  And then look at these headlines.
[00:03:33.177 --> 00:03:33.918]  Secret deal
[00:03:35.404 --> 00:03:38.646]  Could contain a myriad of gun restrictions and ammo bans.
[00:03:39.267 --> 00:03:43.890]  Gun owners of America, let's get Larry Pratt on this Sunday or this Monday.
[00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.954]  Because the word is, from Professor Lott and others, is the next big wave of gun grabbing is coming.
[00:03:51.976 --> 00:03:52.776]  Look at this headline.
[00:03:53.077 --> 00:04:03.124]  Police seize 10 children from off-the-grid homeschool family that openly published photos of their farm life and their good-looking happy homeschooled family on Facebook.
[00:04:04.346 --> 00:04:08.528]  And they just said, well, we don't feel like your kids are getting a good education and they're not vaccinated.
[00:04:08.588 --> 00:04:09.168]  We're taking them.
[00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:10.489]  That's in the news.
[00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.951]  And there's no law in Kentucky to be inoculated, but they just took them.
[00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:16.072]  My children aren't either.
[00:04:17.552 --> 00:04:19.393]  There's no law, but they might, I guess, come.
[00:04:20.494 --> 00:04:21.054]  Here's another one.
[00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:25.296]  Appeals Court rules cops can track your cell phone without a warrant.
[00:04:26.997 --> 00:04:27.878]  Here's another headline.
[00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.619]  Obama is more hostile towards the press than any president in history.
[00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:33.782]  Here's another headline.
[00:04:33.842 --> 00:04:39.167]  Motel sharing daily guest list with police and aiding warrant checks on every guest.
[00:04:39.347 --> 00:04:42.330]  And when you order a pizza from a major chain, same thing happens.
[00:04:43.972 --> 00:04:49.257]  And what I just mentioned, Congress tells court that Congress can't be investigated for insider trading.
[00:04:50.158 --> 00:04:54.623]  I guess if a cop pulls you over and you got a bottle of Jack Daniels and drunk with a
[00:04:55.948 --> 00:04:57.250]  Stripper passed out next to you.
[00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.234]  Just tell him, I can't be investigated for drunk driving.
[00:04:59.574 --> 00:05:00.255]  See how that works.
[00:05:00.656 --> 00:05:02.179]  I guess it may in this new atmosphere.
[00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:03.381]  It's all coming up.
[00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:05.003]  Several big guests as well.
[00:05:09.605 --> 00:05:11.846]  Today's top headlines for May 8, 2015.
[00:05:13.026 --> 00:05:17.288]  Obama is more hostile towards the press than any president in history.
[00:05:17.328 --> 00:05:19.489]  This is an article at Infowars.com.
[00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:28.932]  A brand new Politico poll of White House correspondents finds 65% of reporters say that Obama is the least press-friendly president they've ever seen.
[00:05:28.952 --> 00:05:31.893]  70% of White House reporters believe President Obama dislikes the press.
[00:05:32.173 --> 00:05:38.595]  And 63% of reporters have literally never asked Obama a question at any press conference.
[00:05:38.615 --> 00:05:44.057]  58% say they've never spoken to anyone at the White House other than a flak on the White House press team.
[00:05:44.197 --> 00:05:47.758]  Police seized 10 children from an off-grid homeschool family in Kentucky.
[00:05:47.978 --> 00:05:54.340]  Article up by Paul Joseph Watson on Wednesday after receiving an anonymous tip about the family's traditional lifestyle.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:01.306]  The nightmare story began when sheriff's officers set up a blockade around Joe and Nicole Noller's rural property before entering the premises.
[00:06:01.426 --> 00:06:05.809]  Eight of the kids were out with their father, but Nicole and two of her oldest children were at home.
[00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.972]  Now find out how the story ends at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:10.686 --> 00:06:11.747]  In the near future.
[00:06:12.007 --> 00:06:15.668]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:06:15.688 --> 00:06:16.169]  Security alert.
[00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:17.529]  Security alert.
[00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:19.490]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.371]  Analysis.
[00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:21.291]  InfoWars.
[00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:23.312]  Building independent media operations.
[00:06:23.332 --> 00:06:28.315]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:06:28.335 --> 00:06:29.295]  Crime Directive.
[00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:30.796]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:06:30.896 --> 00:06:33.697]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:06:33.757 --> 00:06:36.859]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:39.180]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.821]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:06:40.841 --> 00:06:42.963]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:45.344]  They are never going to stop.
[00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:49.548]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:06:49.668 --> 00:06:52.850]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.912]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[00:06:56.613 --> 00:06:59.495]  Imperative before Little Minute TV.
[00:06:59.555 --> 00:07:04.018]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:05.680]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.460]  You can feel it.
[00:07:09.278 --> 00:07:10.159]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[00:07:10.239 --> 00:07:10.639]  Good, brother.
[00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:12.461]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:14.282]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:07:14.462 --> 00:07:18.465]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:07:18.485 --> 00:07:21.088]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:23.349]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:31.396]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:07:31.696 --> 00:07:34.820]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.442]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:07:36.482 --> 00:07:39.385]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:40.907]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:07:41.187 --> 00:07:46.493]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:07:46.493 --> 00:07:47.374]  We're good to go.
[00:08:21.685 --> 00:08:23.806]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:24.266 --> 00:08:25.947]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:41.272]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this original live, worldwide broadcast, Friday, the 8th day of May, 2015.
[00:08:42.572 --> 00:08:47.014]  We have a representative coming on from Maine.
[00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:57.457]  Where they are battling to put into law even stronger provisions to allow conscientious and religious objection to forced inoculation.
[00:08:58.477 --> 00:09:03.298]  And we have a filmmaker coming on, the new documentary coming out of dogs and men.
[00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:09.260]  The unprecedented police shooting of even dogs as small as chihuahuas.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.421]  Or police shooting a barking dog that's over a fence.
[00:09:13.941 --> 00:09:14.341]  It's just...
[00:09:15.578 --> 00:09:21.643]  People that want to use their gun too much, that are hotheads, and then you've got police departments defending it.
[00:09:21.743 --> 00:09:26.847]  It's all part of this accelerated, out-of-control militarization.
[00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:28.868]  That is coming up today.
[00:09:28.948 --> 00:09:34.312]  Both those guests will be joining us for the first 20-30 minutes of the second and third hours.
[00:09:35.133 --> 00:09:42.979]  At the bottom of the third hour, or halfway into the hour,
[00:09:44.008 --> 00:09:53.071]  We are going to have David Knight and Rob Dew in studio.
[00:09:53.972 --> 00:10:12.038]  They have got some major developments they're going to break down, dealing with Jade Helm that no one else has basically talked about or looked at, other than establishment trade publications, some of them going back five years.
[00:10:14.138 --> 00:10:19.462]  And we're going to have video clips, we're going to have analysis, we're going to have graphs, breakdowns of all of this.
[00:10:20.022 --> 00:10:25.226]  If you're a radio listener, you can go to InfoWars.com forward slash show to find the free video feed.
[00:10:26.127 --> 00:10:34.813]  Or later by this evening, we'll have full reports on this posted at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:40.697]  But this is just more proof, I'll give you a sneak preview of what's coming up.
[00:10:41.357 --> 00:10:41.938]  A first look
[00:10:42.964 --> 00:11:08.283]  With the fact they're using Facebook and Twitter and systems to geographically map the United States and where the resistance to a globalist takeover is going to be and where resistance to gun confiscation is going to be so they can focus their Rural Affairs Commission run by the Pentagon and they can focus their different FEMA groups and their different threat fusion activities against anyone
[00:11:10.031 --> 00:11:13.173]  Who wants to be self-sufficient and who just wants to be left alone.
[00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:28.700]  This is a full conquering, not just of the states and the cities and the towns, and a full federalization and a conquering of the local police that could be taken back by the people and used to restore law and order by the globalists that have occupied the country.
[00:11:30.261 --> 00:11:32.942]  And that ties into a host of articles that I have today.
[00:11:34.102 --> 00:11:35.783]  I want to try to get this family on.
[00:11:36.504 --> 00:11:39.305]  Police seize 10 children from off-grid homeschool.
[00:11:41.246 --> 00:11:41.666]  Family.
[00:11:41.827 --> 00:11:44.989]  And they've got 26 acres.
[00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:46.671]  It's on a lake.
[00:11:47.492 --> 00:11:48.472]  It's a pastoral.
[00:11:49.013 --> 00:11:52.456]  You can go to their different websites and it just looks like heaven.
[00:11:53.216 --> 00:11:55.038]  Looks like the kind of place my dad grew up.
[00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:58.601]  And just happy, hardworking farming family.
[00:11:58.621 --> 00:12:05.888]  And they have had their children taken and in the CPS report it said they are not inoculated.
[00:12:06.838 --> 00:12:09.241]  And they don't have teaching certificates to teach the children.
[00:12:09.622 --> 00:12:15.369]  California and two other states trying to pass laws, you gotta have a teaching certificate from accredited college to be a homeschooler.
[00:12:16.511 --> 00:12:20.996]  The problem with that is, is A, school choice, B, basic freedom, parental rights.
[00:12:22.078 --> 00:12:23.379]  But when you move on down the line,
[00:12:24.465 --> 00:12:40.340]  The most overarching issue is homeschoolers have the highest test scores, the highest rate of scholarships, the highest rate of corporate headhunting, the highest rate of winning international spelling bees, geography bees, math quizzes.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:47.046]  Everyone knows that almost every international and national spelling bee champion is a homeschooler.
[00:12:50.356 --> 00:12:55.379]  My late uncle and his wife, my aunt, homeschooled their children.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.224]  And one of them runs a music school successfully in New York.
[00:13:02.744 --> 00:13:07.827]  The other works for a major computer company and is already an executive at 35 years old.
[00:13:09.408 --> 00:13:16.573]  The other has been in radio, TV, and very successful, helped launch InfoWars, finally enticed him to come back and work here, Buckley Hammond.
[00:13:16.993 --> 00:13:18.214]  The point is, is that
[00:13:19.289 --> 00:13:23.953]  Homeschooling has become so popular that in Austin, about 20% of the kids are homeschooled.
[00:13:24.073 --> 00:13:25.994]  And now it's not even really homeschooling anymore.
[00:13:26.274 --> 00:13:28.076]  They form their own homeschooling federations.
[00:13:28.476 --> 00:13:33.460]  They have their own homeschooling academies, some of which are bigger than public schools, where the kids go two, three days a week.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.021]  They have so many events.
[00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:36.542]  My children have been homeschooled.
[00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:39.945]  Now, because they want to get into more sports, they're not.
[00:13:40.385 --> 00:13:41.286]  They go to a private school.
[00:13:42.206 --> 00:13:45.008]  And they're enjoying that, but it's still almost quasi.
[00:13:45.048 --> 00:13:50.732]  They let the kids get out for golf or tennis or for field trips or if we want to go on a longer trip.
[00:13:51.933 --> 00:13:56.957]  So it's the private schools, the prep academies are making themselves more like homeschooling.
[00:13:57.417 --> 00:13:59.479]  So it's causing a choice revolution.
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:06.203]  And I can't tell you how many cases of where the CPS's own reports prove they're out of control.
[00:14:08.165 --> 00:14:09.506]  Because it'll just be
[00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:23.216]  I see articles all the time out of the most liberal areas, too, like Washington State or Oregon, where it'll be, the family had five kids and lived in a trailer and had an Airstream bus and were homeschooled.
[00:14:24.297 --> 00:14:31.760]  And you read both parents, you know, they're always PhDs and they're not vaccinated and they have a garden.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:32.781]  Their kids look super healthy.
[00:14:32.821 --> 00:14:33.841]  Their eyes are all shiny.
[00:14:35.362 --> 00:14:36.462]  They don't watch television.
[00:14:36.482 --> 00:14:37.683]  They got their own wind farm.
[00:14:40.458 --> 00:14:45.940]  The kids are volunteering in town for the homeless, and they come and CPS them.
[00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:51.983]  And they inoculate them against the parents' will outside of law, and then they take them away.
[00:14:53.704 --> 00:15:02.908]  And they just put on screen a World Net Daily article about homeschooler parents interrogated about guns, and taxes, and vaccines, and everything else.
[00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:05.769]  There is a major persecution going on.
[00:15:08.766 --> 00:15:12.308]  Caseworker demands follow public school curriculum or we'll take your kids.
[00:15:12.669 --> 00:15:13.709]  That's just another case.
[00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:15.911]  I mean, there is an all-out war.
[00:15:17.372 --> 00:15:23.395]  I had the health department contact me a week ago and said, you haven't filled out your vaccine exemption form in three years.
[00:15:23.436 --> 00:15:23.936]  You need to fill it out.
[00:15:23.976 --> 00:15:24.997]  I went to look at the state law.
[00:15:25.677 --> 00:15:26.858]  They didn't even have to do that.
[00:15:26.878 --> 00:15:28.979]  But the law says it's voluntary.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.422]  But fill out this form so they can track you and surveil you.
[00:15:33.962 --> 00:15:36.344]  This is the atmosphere that we're in in this country.
[00:15:37.793 --> 00:15:39.014]  So we'll be covering that report.
[00:15:41.215 --> 00:15:44.236]  Now I mentioned this earlier, but I'm going to get to it in detail now.
[00:15:45.777 --> 00:15:51.339]  We've got to get Larry Pratt on at 1230 today if we can, or Sunday or Monday.
[00:15:51.359 --> 00:15:52.400]  We need him immediately.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:54.561]  As fast as we can.
[00:15:54.581 --> 00:15:55.521]  Please call every number we've got.
[00:15:57.042 --> 00:16:01.184]  Secret deal could contain a myriad of gun restrictions, ammo bans.
[00:16:02.998 --> 00:16:07.642]  That's Gun Owners of America, full article, Infowars.com.
[00:16:08.503 --> 00:16:22.675]  And believe me, if we didn't have Gun Owners of America to make the NRA hardcore, and even Ted Nugent said that on the air, and he's on the board of the NRA, we'd be down the creek without a you-know-what, a wooden implement, without a paddle.
[00:16:26.104 --> 00:16:29.727]  Secret deal could contain a myriad of gun restrictions, ammo bans.
[00:16:29.787 --> 00:16:42.295]  Now, there's 30 plus provisions, only one's been leaked by WikiLeaks last year, and it says total takeover of the web, web taxes, web regulations, internet IDs, Chinese-style controls.
[00:16:42.936 --> 00:16:44.237]  It's all being lined up right now.
[00:16:44.557 --> 00:16:45.397]  Congress can't see it.
[00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:49.340]  Again, just, just, we're worried about a federal takeover sometime?
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.261]  It already happened.
[00:16:51.021 --> 00:16:51.842]  A global takeover.
[00:16:54.631 --> 00:17:03.679]  And they break down in a four-page article everything that are being done here.
[00:17:04.159 --> 00:17:20.554]  But they're giving Obama fast-track all of the congressional leadership, bipartisan, Mitch McConnell, Boehner, and the Democrats, who now say they love Obama, the Republican leadership, to fast-track the TPP.
[00:17:20.674 --> 00:17:23.276]  I'm going to read over some of this article, but
[00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:31.013]  Obama said he would do this outside of domestic law, and they are moving forward with it.
[00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:40.739]  And they've massively increased the size of the BATF, and they've been trying to take our guns, and now they're restricting ammo, and having the veterans have their guns taken outside of law.
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:41.560]  It's on!
[00:17:43.373 --> 00:17:46.716]  But it's another cold war against the Second Amendment that's starting to heat up.
[00:17:47.256 --> 00:17:55.803]  A long, incremental conditioning process, like our military being conditioned to accept anti-gun, anti-patriot missions and training.
[00:17:56.104 --> 00:18:05.452]  And it's in the video games, in the cartoons, it's in the movies, and then it's in the actual manuals that our military is being prepared to fight their number one enemy themselves, returning veterans.
[00:18:06.052 --> 00:18:09.815]  And as Congressman Gohmert said, listen, the Pentagon trains to take on veterans.
[00:18:09.915 --> 00:18:11.276]  I'm a veteran myself of the Army.
[00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.751]  Why is Texas listed hostile?
[00:18:13.851 --> 00:18:16.273]  Well, now we know.
[00:18:16.994 --> 00:18:21.998]  Indeed, the Pentagon is mapping the United States according to who they think won't go along with the takeover.
[00:18:22.499 --> 00:18:26.702]  And surprise, surprise, as Gomer Powell would say, guess who's listed?
[00:18:31.026 --> 00:18:33.508]  Now, yes, you can turn the Jade Helm map.
[00:18:34.268 --> 00:18:35.790]  I'm going to pull up this graphic later.
[00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.231]  German newspapers have been reporting on it.
[00:18:38.718 --> 00:18:58.944]  And turn the states pretty much on their side, like the Middle East, and Texas is Iran, and you go right through the other red zone, Utah is Syria, and then the West Bank is Southern California, and you can see that map, and you can say, well, it's also a logistical attack for the Middle East, and an overflight plan.
[00:18:59.164 --> 00:18:59.925]  And that's true, too.
[00:19:00.405 --> 00:19:03.586]  Everything the globalists do is multi-use, multi-training.
[00:19:04.406 --> 00:19:06.608]  And no one is blaming the troops themselves.
[00:19:06.928 --> 00:19:10.552]  It's where the strings go back to, as Chuck Norris wrote for WorldNetDaily.
[00:19:12.854 --> 00:19:23.744]  Secret deal could contain a myriad of gun restrictions, ammo bans, and then Larry Pratt, in this article, goes over the different angles and where they're actually already talking about it.
[00:19:24.925 --> 00:19:26.267]  So, it's on.
[00:19:26.307 --> 00:19:27.208]  We're going to go over that.
[00:19:28.339 --> 00:19:29.880]  And then that ties into this huge news.
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:34.824]  The Secretary of Defense, Carter, has come out and said, we're not planning martial law this summer.
[00:19:35.085 --> 00:19:36.205]  We're not going to take Texas over.
[00:19:38.547 --> 00:19:40.289]  Which we didn't say this was for.
[00:19:42.811 --> 00:19:44.292]  We're going to come back and cover that as well.
[00:19:44.332 --> 00:19:48.776]  But the good news is, the sleeping giant is awakening, and they can't assassinate the people.
[00:19:49.833 --> 00:19:50.354]  What's wrong?
[00:19:51.016 --> 00:19:54.443]  You don't like a small group of psychos hijacking your country?
[00:19:54.643 --> 00:19:58.851]  Well, become President of the United States and change it from the...
[00:20:00.976 --> 00:20:01.636]  Never mind.
[00:20:01.656 --> 00:20:06.798]  Three shots fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:20:06.918 --> 00:20:12.541]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this... Has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:20:12.681 --> 00:20:16.682]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:18.223]  Silverlungs.com.

[00:20:26.389 --> 00:20:28.171]  So stop paying for Silver Solutions.

[00:21:18.378 --> 00:21:26.605]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:31.450]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:21:52.562 --> 00:21:56.905]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[00:22:09.636 --> 00:22:10.437]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:22:10.457 --> 00:22:11.938]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?

[00:22:41.371 --> 00:22:42.092]  Another shooting.
[00:22:42.512 --> 00:22:43.754]  And they're getting worse.
[00:22:44.214 --> 00:22:47.437]  That's why Infidel Body Armor introduces Infidel Fridays.

[00:24:16.026 --> 00:24:16.767]  Big Brother.
[00:24:18.128 --> 00:24:19.369]  Mainstream media.
[00:24:20.911 --> 00:24:22.012]  Government cover-ups.
[00:24:23.476 --> 00:24:24.417]  You want answers?
[00:24:25.418 --> 00:24:27.160]  Well, so does he.
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:33.906]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:24:35.388 --> 00:24:36.629]  Man, it's a heavy news day.
[00:24:39.795 --> 00:24:44.138]  Congress has told the courts that Congress can't be investigated for insider trading.
[00:24:44.158 --> 00:24:46.179]  You want to know why they're so corrupt?
[00:24:46.279 --> 00:24:48.501]  They got a license to steal, according to them.
[00:24:48.721 --> 00:24:52.804]  Well, you can't pass a law saying you can commit a crime when it's illegal for other people to do it.
[00:24:52.944 --> 00:24:54.745]  That's just injurious prudence.
[00:24:54.805 --> 00:24:55.405]  It's well known.
[00:24:55.866 --> 00:24:57.086]  It's called tyranny.
[00:25:00.629 --> 00:25:02.590]  We've got record 93,194,000 Americans not in the labor force.
[00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:03.450]  A record 56 million women not working.
[00:25:09.528 --> 00:25:12.349]  April unemployment 5.4, it's more like 10%.
[00:25:13.349 --> 00:25:15.190]  Up 223 plus thousand.
[00:25:16.971 --> 00:25:19.811]  I'm gonna break down what I think happened in the UK election.
[00:25:25.293 --> 00:25:31.115]  Up on InfoWars.com, I just mentioned this, police seized 10 children from off-the-grid homeschooling family.
[00:25:31.755 --> 00:25:36.057]  Secret deal could contain a myriad of gun restrictions, ammo bans, that's coming up.
[00:25:37.574 --> 00:25:41.678]  The 90,000 square foot, 100 million dollar home that is a metaphor for America.
[00:25:42.679 --> 00:25:48.304]  Rush asks why left isn't censoring gay marriage so as not to incite radical islamicists.
[00:25:49.085 --> 00:25:55.491]  That's right, you gotta censor all free speech that's conservative or libertarian because it might anger the islamicists.
[00:25:56.833 --> 00:25:59.455]  But the gay marriage has to continue.
[00:25:59.816 --> 00:26:02.058]  Notice the islamicists haven't been attacking too much of that.
[00:26:06.513 --> 00:26:07.854]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[00:26:12.057 --> 00:26:14.759]  But getting back to Carter denies Internet rumors.
[00:26:14.779 --> 00:26:16.020]  That's the Secretary of Defense.
[00:26:16.621 --> 00:26:18.262]  No Texas takeover planned.
[00:26:18.742 --> 00:26:26.488]  And that way, when there isn't a takeover, martial law, gun confiscation this summer, they can say, look, you were all crazy.
[00:26:26.828 --> 00:26:28.730]  That's called putting out a false argument.
[00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.411]  That's called constructing a straw man.
[00:26:32.108 --> 00:26:40.192]  You know, if you can't really beat Mayweather in the ring as a welterweight, you just build a papier-mâché of him and you beat that up and you say that you beat up Mayweather.
[00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:50.058]  Or if you can't beat a top golfer, say a Tiger Woods at golf, you just
[00:26:51.451 --> 00:26:53.573]  Find some neighbor who's never played golf before.
[00:26:54.394 --> 00:26:56.036]  Tell him his name's Tiger and you go out.
[00:26:56.196 --> 00:26:56.876]  He's a white guy.
[00:26:56.896 --> 00:26:58.718]  He's not Tiger Woods.
[00:26:59.519 --> 00:27:00.200]  Doesn't play golf.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.661]  You beat him and you say you beat Tiger Woods.
[00:27:02.362 --> 00:27:03.383]  That's what a straw man is.
[00:27:08.949 --> 00:27:10.630]  Carter denies internet rumors.
[00:27:10.951 --> 00:27:12.452]  No Texas takeover planned.
[00:27:12.492 --> 00:27:14.935]  Associated Press in newspapers across the country.
[00:27:15.851 --> 00:27:22.516]  Defense Secretary Ash Carter flatly denied last night that frenzied internet speculation that the U.S.
[00:27:22.536 --> 00:27:26.600]  military exercise in Texas is part of a hostile takeover or other nefarious Pentagon mission.
[00:27:28.286 --> 00:27:34.012]  Well, there is drills all over the country with footage of the military with role players saying they're sovereign citizens or patriots.
[00:27:34.472 --> 00:27:48.385]  And the vets are having their guns taken right now, and there is gun confiscation and knockin' talks going on around the country asking about people's guns, and there is an open border outside of law, and there is all this tyranny, and Obama says he's going to raise taxes through executive orders.
[00:27:48.926 --> 00:27:52.049]  So, yeah, people are concerned about everything, and that's good.
[00:27:54.923 --> 00:27:59.506]  But they hope to make all of our concerns rise and fall on Jade Helm and make it just about that.
[00:27:59.747 --> 00:28:02.969]  But believe me, they don't like the fact that there's such an awakening to this.
[00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:10.515]  Asked during a news conference about Jade Helm 15 exercise and whether the Pentagon was planning to overtake Texas,
[00:28:11.235 --> 00:28:16.480]  And again, if we go to the Pentagon website, you can go to the Office of the Secretary, and they have the video there.
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.504]  Carter simply said no as people in a packed room laughed.
[00:28:21.144 --> 00:28:24.868]  Oh, see, they get invited into the room like White House vets people, too.
[00:28:25.148 --> 00:28:26.029]  They all play along.
[00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:26.850]  Ha ha ha!
[00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.752]  It's funny to say we're a police state and have warrantless wiretapping.
[00:28:31.001 --> 00:28:33.322]  TSA, while the border's wide open.
[00:28:34.883 --> 00:28:35.704]  There's nothing wrong.
[00:28:35.744 --> 00:28:39.226]  The IRS isn't taking people's houses and businesses with no proof of anything.
[00:28:39.486 --> 00:28:40.927]  There's no asset formature seizure.
[00:28:41.127 --> 00:28:42.748]  There's no political persecution of the press.
[00:28:43.008 --> 00:28:43.329]  Well, wait.
[00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.810]  There is all of that.
[00:28:48.232 --> 00:28:50.273]  The exercise is the largest conducted by U.S.
[00:28:50.373 --> 00:28:51.774]  Army Special Operations Command.
[00:28:52.274 --> 00:28:58.238]  The military routinely conducts massive air, ground, sea, and training around the world and often with multiple other countries.
[00:29:01.121 --> 00:29:08.163]  The problem here is, is that it's clearly infiltration training, and the Army manuals say they're training to take on the American people.
[00:29:08.844 --> 00:29:21.968]  Texas Governor Greg Abbott has asked State Guard to monitor the training exercise last week, where the 200 people packed a meeting in rural Bastrop, and other cities are canceling it, asking whether the government was planning to confiscate guns or implement martial law.
[00:29:22.268 --> 00:29:24.989]  Well, they've been training to do it for a while, and they did it in Katrina.
[00:29:26.169 --> 00:29:27.810]  So yeah, we're here ready.
[00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.531]  Ever vigilant, as the founders said, and they can't stand it.
[00:29:35.868 --> 00:29:39.574]  They go on to have the defense department say they're very up front with their training activities.
[00:29:39.694 --> 00:29:44.721]  Oh yeah, that's why they would say that black helicopters basically don't exist.
[00:29:45.956 --> 00:29:53.978]  When they're doing these huge drills and tell you you're crazy if you saw them blow up something near you or in a military training to take over the local gun shop.
[00:29:54.378 --> 00:29:55.039]  And I got news.
[00:29:55.079 --> 00:29:58.380]  They got military doing law enforcement all over the country illegally.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.960]  We've got it on video.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.921]  And we're exposing the elephant in the room.
[00:30:02.941 --> 00:30:05.602]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.639 --> 00:30:13.340]  Listen to how a drone could spoof Wi-Fi and steal your data.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:20.603]  By attaching a tiny computer to a drone, robot experts were able to show how the device could be used for nefarious purposes.
[00:30:20.823 --> 00:30:26.965]  While in the sky, the drone poses as an open Wi-Fi network and tricks other devices to connect to it.
[00:30:27.245 --> 00:30:34.114]  Once that connection has been made, any information that passes through, like credit card information or home addresses, can be obtained.
[00:30:34.314 --> 00:30:42.525]  Because drones are inexpensive, small, and hard to detect when they're high in the sky, bad guys can operate illegally and anonymously.
[00:30:42.745 --> 00:30:45.046]  But there are some simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:30:45.427 --> 00:30:48.028]  Avoiding open Wi-Fi networks is the first step.
[00:30:48.368 --> 00:30:54.092]  And if you must connect to a public Wi-Fi network, make sure the web address you visit is correct and not a dummy site.
[00:30:54.452 --> 00:30:58.174]  Only open websites that have HTTPS in the address.
[00:30:58.575 --> 00:31:05.939]  And when accessing a banking website, only continue if a lock appears indicating that it's a secure and encrypted connection.

[00:33:17.305 --> 00:33:19.426]  Come on, come on, come on, baby!
[00:33:19.486 --> 00:33:28.429]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:29.289 --> 00:33:32.770]  The globalists have us in a stranglehold, but we have them in a stranglehold as well.
[00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:38.712]  We're like a sperm whale with a big, giant squid attached to our face.
[00:33:39.966 --> 00:33:42.388]  But we're not biting or fighting back like a sperm whale would do.
[00:33:42.428 --> 00:33:46.050]  We're just sitting there and letting it chew on us until it realizes we got teeth.
[00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:47.391]  We're bigger.
[00:33:47.451 --> 00:33:48.031]  We're stronger.
[00:33:48.051 --> 00:33:48.852]  We got more history.
[00:33:49.272 --> 00:33:50.653]  We've got bigger hearts.
[00:33:51.473 --> 00:33:52.034]  More will.
[00:33:53.715 --> 00:33:55.716]  Yeah, let's crank up old Ted Nuja for a minute.
[00:34:13.277 --> 00:34:14.918]  You best get out of the way, globalist.
[00:34:16.858 --> 00:34:22.180]  I'd say it's a stranglehold when most of the military I talk to are aware that they're being trained for illegal operations.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:34.464]  That's why when they get up on the news and say that patriots that are concerned about domestic military operations being directed towards the people of this country, when they claim that we hate the military, it doesn't fly.
[00:34:35.784 --> 00:34:37.025]  The duck doesn't quack.
[00:34:37.905 --> 00:34:39.125]  The dog doesn't hunt.
[00:34:40.466 --> 00:34:41.446]  The motor don't run.
[00:34:44.898 --> 00:34:52.181]  I've not covered the UK election yet because I'm going to be honest with you, I'm cogitating on it.
[00:34:53.882 --> 00:35:00.344]  And we're going to get Paul Watson to pop on sometime either this hour or next to give his expert take living in London.
[00:35:01.565 --> 00:35:09.188]  We get Steve Watson on, he's got a degree in geopolitics and in UK affairs.
[00:35:11.812 --> 00:35:24.464]  But as best I can tell you, as a first approximation, and I do follow UK politics, 83% of UK laws get made by the EU, and that's not elected, that's the bureaucracy.
[00:35:26.466 --> 00:35:33.812]  Cameron has been posing like UKIP, the kind of Ron Paul Patriot Party, that's the fastest growing, but it's still medium size.
[00:35:34.993 --> 00:35:35.934]  Did gain some seats.
[00:35:36.949 --> 00:35:40.392]  is real fast growing in the EU Parliament, but still they're only ceremonial.
[00:35:40.932 --> 00:35:42.333]  But it is an important bully pulpit.
[00:35:43.675 --> 00:35:50.040]  And so because Cameron did behave like a patriot, he ended up winning.
[00:35:54.283 --> 00:35:55.484]  Doesn't mean Cameron's good.
[00:35:55.765 --> 00:35:56.445]  He's a globalist.
[00:35:56.485 --> 00:35:58.887]  Went to Bilderberg a few years ago when I was there covering it.
[00:36:01.629 --> 00:36:04.472]  The Tories go along with Labour for the same agenda.
[00:36:05.509 --> 00:36:13.384]  But this is a referendum on getting out of the EU, and they've been trying to force a vote to keep the UK in the EU.
[00:36:13.664 --> 00:36:16.490]  They never got a vote 20 years ago on entering it.
[00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:32.633]  So this whole big coalition of mainly leftists and others thought they'd take over the country and open the borders up even more, but they were honest about what they wanted to do.
[00:36:33.753 --> 00:36:35.194]  So folks have gone with Cameron.
[00:36:35.714 --> 00:36:51.599]  If you believe the election, and there is election fraud in the UK, probably not as bad as here from what I've seen, what I've studied, because they do count the votes locally, but that's the best breakdown I can
[00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:53.952]  Give you on that front.
[00:36:54.552 --> 00:36:57.293]  They're saying, why the pollsters got it wrong.
[00:36:57.994 --> 00:37:01.856]  They were saying a big leftist coalition sweep was going to happen.
[00:37:02.936 --> 00:37:08.079]  And then the conservatives didn't just squeak by, they won by a nice margin.
[00:37:12.489 --> 00:37:14.751]  Together we'll make Great Britain greater still.
[00:37:15.132 --> 00:37:21.959]  Cameron Hales shocked Tory outright majority as Meliband, Clegg and Farage all quit.
[00:37:22.579 --> 00:37:26.003]  SNP wins near clear sweep of seats in Scotland.
[00:37:28.425 --> 00:37:33.631]  And I got a stinging suspicion if we can get Farage on, he's been on many times, or get Lord Monckton who founded UKIP.
[00:37:37.984 --> 00:37:40.388]  That they'll have a different angle on it.
[00:37:40.729 --> 00:37:42.171]  In fact, that's an idea.
[00:37:42.191 --> 00:37:44.135]  Let's try to get Lord Monckton on Sunday if he'll do it.
[00:37:44.876 --> 00:37:46.199]  Or one of the other UKIP people.
[00:37:49.451 --> 00:37:50.873]  Here's the Bloomberg headline.
[00:37:50.953 --> 00:37:56.279]  Bloomberg business UK gamblers trump pollsters in calling Cameron's re-election.
[00:37:56.319 --> 00:38:03.889]  Yeah, the Las Vegas or other major gambling spreads are always more accurate than pollsters.
[00:38:04.449 --> 00:38:08.434]  Pollsters are pretty accurate in widespread polls that aren't super key.
[00:38:09.195 --> 00:38:24.067]  But when you get down to elections, you know, you'll hear, this person's going to win, that person's going to win, because these polling places will really destroy their credibility when it comes down to a major election, because they're getting, in many cases, behind the scenes contracts and things.
[00:38:25.448 --> 00:38:28.731]  We're going to get Paul Watson's take on this.
[00:38:28.791 --> 00:38:33.375]  Paul Watson was busy today covering geopolitical activities.
[00:38:33.395 --> 00:38:35.536]  Decided to see him write about the UK.
[00:38:36.826 --> 00:38:42.729]  He was too busy writing about police seized 10 children from off-the-grid homeschooling family in Kentucky.
[00:38:43.489 --> 00:38:47.931]  We were too busy covering secret deal could contain a myriad of gun restrictions, ammo bans.
[00:38:48.391 --> 00:38:52.833]  The head of Gunners of America, Larry Pratt, will be joining us to give us a breakdown.
[00:38:52.853 --> 00:39:02.417]  We should tweet that Obama launching international gun ban initiative through treaty, or is Obama, we know he is, but
[00:39:04.161 --> 00:39:07.843]  Head of Gunners of America will expose Obama's new gun-grab push.
[00:39:08.223 --> 00:39:09.004]  Need to tweet that out.
[00:39:09.024 --> 00:39:12.266]  He's coming up in 51 minutes.
[00:39:13.667 --> 00:39:14.947]  We have a jam-packed transmission.
[00:39:15.267 --> 00:39:22.031]  The last 30 minutes of the broadcast today, huge breaking, new developments on Jade Helm that ties a bunch of this together.
[00:39:22.792 --> 00:39:24.333]  It's really even quite shocking to me.
[00:39:24.353 --> 00:39:31.537]  I was aware of some of this, but Rob Dew and David Knight, along with our great intrepid listeners, who are really our investigative reporters,
[00:39:34.151 --> 00:39:35.972]  ...have really ferreted out some key intel.
[00:39:36.012 --> 00:39:42.735]  There's video breaking it down, but we'll have the rest of the story in about two hours at InfoWars.com.
[00:39:42.855 --> 00:39:45.256]  Red-linked proof Pentagon mapping U.S.
[00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:47.257]  for insurgents.
[00:39:50.699 --> 00:39:53.961]  Patriot insurgents, we should add that word to the headline.
[00:39:55.319 --> 00:39:57.261]  The US for domestic insurgents.
[00:39:58.062 --> 00:40:05.909]  Sub-headline, including patriots, because they're mapping it, according to demographics, with all of that information.
[00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:15.558]  But joining us from all beyond, from the Britannic Isles, from the UK, under EU control, never had a vote,
[00:40:17.182 --> 00:40:18.802]  You're there in the middle of this, Paul.
[00:40:19.022 --> 00:40:33.125]  I gave my take, but I gave the proviso that I know politics are very sophisticated, and so I'm not going to act like most talk show hosts and say I know everything when I'm not a master of a subject.
[00:40:33.565 --> 00:40:34.565]  You're in the middle of it.
[00:40:36.406 --> 00:40:37.486]  What's really going on here?
[00:40:37.546 --> 00:40:42.527]  I mean, did Cameron act like Ukip and steal their thunder for this victory?
[00:40:44.554 --> 00:40:47.236]  Yeah, that's basically what happened, Alex.
[00:40:47.616 --> 00:41:08.731]  The Conservatives won because people were so terrified of Ed Miliband, the open Marxist, basically, who's completely charmless and frightening, that potential UKIP voters switched their votes to Conservatives simply to ensure that Labour, the Socialists, the extreme left-wingers, and Ed Miliband didn't get in power.
[00:41:09.446 --> 00:41:12.148]  So that's why basically Farage lost.
[00:41:12.248 --> 00:41:19.755]  If you look at his seat in South Bennet, he got 32% of the vote, but the Conservative won with 38% of the vote.
[00:41:20.255 --> 00:41:32.065]  So if the media hadn't said that it was such a close race between Labour and Conservative, which they did for months, it turned out it wasn't, then a lot of those voters would have voted for Farage and he would have held his seat.
[00:41:32.585 --> 00:41:37.269]  But even in saying that, it was a very successful election generally for UKIP.
[00:41:37.873 --> 00:41:45.156]  They got nearly 4 million votes, which is more than the Liberal Democrats and the SNP combined.
[00:41:45.196 --> 00:41:51.159]  So UKIP, for taking the whole of the United Kingdom into account, is now the third biggest party.
[00:41:51.399 --> 00:42:00.783]  And that's been started, what, 30 years ago by Nigel Farage and Lord Christopher Monckton, now one of the biggest in Parliament in the EU, and basically
[00:42:02.203 --> 00:42:04.506]  They behave and act like Ron Paul or this show.
[00:42:04.886 --> 00:42:07.789]  That's got to be very exciting, Paul, to really show an awakening happening.
[00:42:09.082 --> 00:42:10.704]  It's going to be very exciting for 2020.
[00:42:11.484 --> 00:42:14.887]  The problem is the system is so unrepresentative.
[00:42:14.927 --> 00:42:16.769]  It's a first-past-the-post system.
[00:42:17.249 --> 00:42:35.306]  So even though, for example, UKIP got almost 3.9 million votes, they only got one seat in Parliament, whereas the Scottish National Party got only 1.4 million votes, so less than half, but they get 56 seats in the Parliament.
[00:42:35.968 --> 00:42:37.669]  And so it's completely unrepresentative.
[00:42:37.709 --> 00:42:44.152]  That's how they tricked the Scots into staying with the UK, was in a way giving them more representation.
[00:42:44.172 --> 00:42:53.938]  So it's almost like the Socialist Scots, I'm not knocking the Scots, but they've been totally domesticated, have actually kind of conquered England this way, by being given too many votes.
[00:42:53.998 --> 00:42:54.578]  Is that accurate?
[00:42:56.229 --> 00:43:04.716]  Yeah, and it's also the fact that they game the system so the established parties have a greater chance and newer parties have very little chance whatsoever.
[00:43:05.096 --> 00:43:13.983]  But as far as UKIP are concerned, they've got 12.6% of the vote share, which is the third biggest vote share after Conservative and Labour.
[00:43:14.343 --> 00:43:24.231]  So they're going to be very influential in 2020, especially if Cameron goes completely globalist, which he now probably will because he's got a clear majority.
[00:43:24.711 --> 00:43:25.872]  There's no coalition.
[00:43:26.732 --> 00:43:35.657]  He will probably become a lot less popular in 2020 and he may have to rely on UKIP to form a coalition or whoever takes over from Cameron.
[00:43:35.997 --> 00:43:41.060]  So UKIP are going to be very influential in 2020 according to these results.
[00:43:42.515 --> 00:43:43.136]  All right, Paul.
[00:43:43.176 --> 00:43:45.237]  Well, thank you so much for that analysis.
[00:43:45.718 --> 00:43:48.720]  On other fronts, I went to this family's website.
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:53.123]  Maybe we can go to InfoWars.com and click on their website in the article to show folks more photos.
[00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:56.586]  Police seized 10 children from off-the-grid homeschool family.
[00:43:57.527 --> 00:44:00.249]  They're out there running a gardening operation.
[00:44:00.329 --> 00:44:05.853]  Parents work part of the time, raise the kids, look like really healthy kids.
[00:44:07.534 --> 00:44:09.276]  But it's in the CPSO report.
[00:44:10.572 --> 00:44:15.965]  They're saying they're unvaccinated and that quote, they didn't have proof they were getting full schooling.
[00:44:16.346 --> 00:44:18.311]  There's no law against homeschooling, not yet.
[00:44:19.465 --> 00:44:22.466]  They're trying to pass them in, what, three different states right now.
[00:44:23.987 --> 00:44:25.128]  But this is just crazy.
[00:44:25.168 --> 00:44:26.849]  And I see these articles all the time.
[00:44:26.869 --> 00:44:35.513]  There's a new one in World Net Daily today where they show up and say, we want to see your vaccine records and we want to make sure that you don't have any guns.
[00:44:35.633 --> 00:44:38.194]  Well, you're allowed to have guns and you're allowed to not vaccinate.
[00:44:38.654 --> 00:44:41.456]  So the government's claiming that it's neglect.
[00:44:42.256 --> 00:44:45.062]  When it's not neglect, plus there's no judge or jury.
[00:44:45.623 --> 00:44:48.168]  And if you go to their website, you can see photos that they were posting.
[00:44:48.449 --> 00:44:49.010]  That's their website.
[00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.912]  I think they have a Facebook.
[00:44:51.294 --> 00:44:52.035]  I looked at it this morning.
[00:44:52.055 --> 00:44:58.781]  I know there's a link on this article that shows the family with their traditional lifestyle and the stuff they do.
[00:44:58.841 --> 00:45:08.570]  I mean, this is the discrimination against the nuclear family, the discrimination against people and their dogs and their goats out there living the dream.
[00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:14.855]  This is the way I wish I could live and not have to, you know, be in the middle of a technocracy, but I do it to fight the globalists, Paul.
[00:45:15.476 --> 00:45:16.577]  Tell folks about this article.
[00:45:18.928 --> 00:45:22.171]  Well, obviously this is a family with an idyllic lifestyle.
[00:45:22.611 --> 00:45:29.737]  They're out there in Kentucky, 26 acres of land, living a perfectly healthy, natural, free-range lifestyle.
[00:45:30.484 --> 00:45:36.267]  And basically, the cops showed up, blockaded their property, based on an anonymous tip.
[00:45:36.327 --> 00:45:42.131]  This is the most frightening aspect of this, even more so, I would say, than them being targeted by the authorities.
[00:45:42.591 --> 00:45:51.616]  It was an anonymous tip from somebody who knew this family, who said they were suspicious because they had this traditional free-range lifestyle.
[00:45:51.936 --> 00:45:57.840]  And if you go to the website, the father actually speculates, and it's not confirmed, but he speculates
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:06.862]  That the reason the authorities were sick on this family was because he unfriended somebody on Facebook.
[00:46:07.603 --> 00:46:13.984]  I was about to say, they're saying that the report probably came off of Facebook, which really it looks idyllic.
[00:46:14.004 --> 00:46:15.625]  The children look extremely healthy.
[00:46:16.305 --> 00:46:24.867]  I mean, imagine if other kids could grow up on a river in the woods, you know, by a lake in the Appalachian Mountains.
[00:46:25.007 --> 00:46:26.428]  I mean, this looks like heaven.
[00:46:27.488 --> 00:46:38.256]  And I guess because they look like kids out of a fairy tale with flowers in their hair, and they're out having a great time, and they have the rubber band guns, and they're playing.
[00:46:38.296 --> 00:46:47.023]  I mean, imagine the horror there now in some orphanage or in some foster care with, you know, 15 other... And you know they've split them up, too.
[00:46:47.523 --> 00:46:49.324]  These poor little children are being traumatized.
[00:46:49.344 --> 00:46:49.945]  This is sick.
[00:46:51.786 --> 00:46:58.833]  Yeah, according to the latest update from The Mother, they don't even know where the two oldest boys are, so it's really concerning.
[00:46:58.893 --> 00:47:13.227]  The good news is, they had a GoFundMe page just about two hours after we put this article up, they already met their $10,000 figure, so they've already got most of their legal fees covered, but obviously we encourage people to support them.
[00:47:13.247 --> 00:47:16.170]  Yeah, I want to send reporters... Sorry, Paul, go ahead.
[00:47:18.396 --> 00:47:23.680]  No, the latest update is that they've now got legal representation, so they're starting to fight this.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.902]  Yeah, they need to sue everybody involved.
[00:47:27.723 --> 00:47:35.328]  I'll see articles where the CPS has been to a house five, six times, and there's a kid that's six years old that should weigh, you know, 70 pounds.
[00:47:36.889 --> 00:47:44.631]  And they weigh 22 pounds, and they're covered in, you know, feces and flies, and the CPS leaves them there until they die.
[00:47:44.651 --> 00:47:49.073]  I mean, that happened outside Austin last year because it was a black baby, a black child.
[00:47:49.913 --> 00:47:56.595]  But if they're healthy white kids, I mean, they can get up to half a mil per child through the adoption mills.
[00:47:57.615 --> 00:48:03.816]  And DynCorp, involved in child trafficking worldwide in Texas, is the biggest private contractor for CPS.
[00:48:05.397 --> 00:48:07.537]  And it's just, it's outside of law.
[00:48:07.957 --> 00:48:09.317]  It's totally arbitrary.
[00:48:09.778 --> 00:48:10.878]  It's totally selective.
[00:48:10.938 --> 00:48:12.438]  And Paul, we see the articles every day.
[00:48:12.458 --> 00:48:16.819]  In fact, there's like five articles today about different families.
[00:48:17.439 --> 00:48:18.699]  No criminal record, no nothing.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.580]  I mean, the CPS doesn't even say anything's been done wrong.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:24.701]  Just, we don't think your kids are getting a proper education.
[00:48:25.021 --> 00:48:25.641]  They're out of here.
[00:48:26.556 --> 00:48:30.259]  And then, how long have the children been kidnapped, Paul?
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:36.483]  Well, this happened on Wednesday, so it's 48 hours now, at least.
[00:48:36.563 --> 00:48:40.506]  Yeah, and they've got them to, again, break their will and get the kids to make something up.
[00:48:40.787 --> 00:48:47.572]  They're guaranteed, if it follows fast patterns, saying, look, you know, tell us this happened, you'll be able to see Mommy again.
[00:48:48.112 --> 00:48:54.777]  Then they'll trick the parents, if they didn't have representation that was good, and say... Yeah, that's... Go ahead, Paul.
[00:48:55.839 --> 00:49:03.425]  Yeah, and there's another case in New Jersey which she touched upon, where the CPS worker just came to the house and demanded to be let in.
[00:49:03.825 --> 00:49:11.691]  The parents, not being too aware of their rights, called the police and then the police basically sent her in and conducted this warrantless search.
[00:49:12.112 --> 00:49:13.873]  They're now suing the CPS.
[00:49:15.256 --> 00:49:16.017]  We're good to go.
[00:49:34.025 --> 00:49:43.812]  And I explain, you know, there's due process in this country, and I know you want to follow due process, and I know you don't want to get in any litigation with someone that knows how to litigate and has the means to do it.
[00:49:44.593 --> 00:49:53.240]  So, you need to tell me who made the report, and I need to see all the facts, and I'm going to get my lawyer, and then you can come back and meet once we've identified.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:55.241]  And they go, we don't have to reveal who does reports.
[00:49:55.301 --> 00:50:00.265]  I go, oh, but under the Constitution, Article such and such, here, let me show you, that's the case.
[00:50:00.325 --> 00:50:01.306]  And boy, they don't come back.
[00:50:01.866 --> 00:50:08.088]  But the average person thinks groveling and not knowing your rights gets you ahead, and I'm sorry, it doesn't.
[00:50:08.668 --> 00:50:12.129]  The CPS has the highest turnover, about 55% nationwide.
[00:50:12.929 --> 00:50:16.971]  And it's because a lot of people get into it, get a degree for the right reason, wanting to help kids.
[00:50:17.471 --> 00:50:19.871]  So I've talked to CPS workers and social workers that are good.
[00:50:20.612 --> 00:50:22.332]  And they say, no, Alex, you're right.
[00:50:22.772 --> 00:50:23.493]  We have quotas.
[00:50:24.013 --> 00:50:26.073]  They put bad people in that want to abuse kids.
[00:50:26.113 --> 00:50:26.934]  We can't get them out.
[00:50:27.014 --> 00:50:27.774]  That's why we quit.
[00:50:28.638 --> 00:50:36.247]  I've talked to a lot of folks that got out of it because it's a greater evil than even the abusive families out there.
[00:50:36.508 --> 00:50:37.769]  And there are abusive families.
[00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:48.062]  But it needs to be done through due process, through the legal system and through the courts, not through family courts founded a hundred years ago in New York City by Margaret Sanger and David Rockefeller's father.
[00:50:49.204 --> 00:50:54.549]  The Nazis, of course, established health departments and CPS and took over four million children as well.
[00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:56.932]  For neglect, of course, because they love them.
[00:50:57.232 --> 00:51:02.117]  Paul Watson, great job on all your reportage at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:54:31.223 --> 00:54:33.924]  Dave Mustaine and Megadeth bringing us in.
[00:54:34.164 --> 00:54:34.824]  Crank it up!
[00:54:46.468 --> 00:54:51.949]  Larry Brett is joining us, coming up in 2 minutes.
[00:54:52.209 --> 00:54:52.709]  37 minutes.
[00:55:20.569 --> 00:55:22.010]  We'll hit the gun news then.
[00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:25.051]  It is so big and it's up at Infowars.com.
[00:55:25.071 --> 00:55:28.132]  That's public enemy number one, Dave Mustaine, some of his newer music.
[00:55:29.013 --> 00:55:35.355]  Secret deal could contain a myriad of gun restrictions and ammo bans.
[00:55:35.796 --> 00:55:39.097]  And then we've got chilling statements with some of the gun grabbers that show that's exactly what's in it.
[00:55:39.117 --> 00:55:41.118]  But oh, I'm sorry, we're not allowed to see it.
[00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:47.721]  The dictator gets to make all those decisions and Congress is too busy insider trading
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:51.920]  To do anything about it.
[00:55:52.801 --> 00:55:56.763]  Congress tells court that Congress can't be investigated for insider trading.
[00:55:58.443 --> 00:56:12.410]  In a little notice brief filed last summer, lawyers for the House of Representatives claimed that an SEC investigation of congressional insider trading should be blocked on principle because lawmakers and their staff are constitutionally protected from such inquiries given the nature of their work.
[00:56:13.345 --> 00:56:16.066]  And in a way, because the executive runs that, it's kind of true.
[00:56:16.607 --> 00:56:18.047]  And they've been leaving the executive alone.
[00:56:18.067 --> 00:56:20.168]  But what about state and federal grand juries?
[00:56:20.608 --> 00:56:22.129]  They should be indicting these people.
[00:56:22.989 --> 00:56:27.151]  But Congress passed a law seven years ago claiming that it's legal for them to.
[00:56:27.832 --> 00:56:29.292]  I mean, we're just so far gone.
[00:56:29.332 --> 00:56:30.533]  That's what's crazy about this.
[00:56:32.694 --> 00:56:34.155]  People say, well then let it go all the way.
[00:56:34.435 --> 00:56:37.598]  Historically, once that happens, everything falls apart.
[00:56:37.678 --> 00:56:38.999]  They're going to grab the pension funds.
[00:56:39.359 --> 00:56:40.960]  They'll destroy the prosperity.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:45.203]  The crooks we've got running things will destroy the prosperity.
[00:56:45.223 --> 00:56:48.606]  They'll kill the golden goose to dominate and control.
[00:56:49.466 --> 00:56:50.247]  Look at Napoleon.
[00:56:50.547 --> 00:56:51.388]  Look at the Soviets.
[00:56:51.548 --> 00:56:52.188]  Look at Hitler.
[00:56:52.448 --> 00:56:53.389]  Look at Genghis Khan.
[00:56:53.649 --> 00:56:54.530]  Look at Attila the Hun.
[00:56:56.721 --> 00:57:01.683]  The mindset of these rapacious elites are take over and dominate no matter what.
[00:57:01.983 --> 00:57:03.564]  That's their nature, is conquering.
[00:57:04.445 --> 00:57:08.607]  Through pillaging, through invasion, through fraud.
[00:57:08.667 --> 00:57:13.049]  And now we're under a corporate global fraud where they use economic warfare.
[00:57:13.269 --> 00:57:13.669]  We're here!
[00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:18.171]  So that's all coming up in the next hour as well.
[00:57:19.152 --> 00:57:20.232]  But folks are fighting back.
[00:57:20.252 --> 00:57:24.034]  We've got a state rep coming on and this legislation is moving forward to
[00:57:25.526 --> 00:57:28.468]  Turn the tide in the forced inoculation move.
[00:57:28.488 --> 00:57:29.129]  That's coming up.
[00:57:29.649 --> 00:57:39.456]  Before I go any further, I want to remind everybody that we've got a bunch of specials running that will end this weekend, by Monday morning.

[01:00:14.076 --> 01:00:18.258]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:18.918 --> 01:00:19.718]  You want answers?
[01:00:20.499 --> 01:00:21.379]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.059 --> 01:00:25.681]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.241 --> 01:00:30.283]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:47.483 --> 01:01:01.085]  Coming up, at the bottom of the hour, Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America is going to break down Obama's latest raft of covert and underhanded operations against the Second Amendment.
[01:01:03.542 --> 01:01:09.708]  Secret deal could contain a myriad of gun restrictions, ammo bans in the new TPP global treaty.
[01:01:10.489 --> 01:01:13.511]  That is coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:01:13.551 --> 01:01:24.782]  We have a state representative joining us who's on the offense and hey we just got the fluoride taken out of pesticides and the fluoride level in the water they've ordered cut by half by 2017.
[01:01:25.923 --> 01:01:28.946]  That's because almost every scientist at the EPA
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:34.842]  And for that matter, the FDA had a bunch join them and say this is deadly poison, take it out.
[01:01:35.462 --> 01:01:36.983]  It's taken them a decade, but it's happening.
[01:01:37.023 --> 01:01:38.464]  I mean, we're gaining ground.
[01:01:38.905 --> 01:01:40.766]  They're admitting glyphosate's causing cancer.
[01:01:41.666 --> 01:01:42.807]  We're gaining ground.
[01:01:42.827 --> 01:01:50.992]  It's not about left or right, it's not about this issue's a leftist issue, this is a right-wing issue, it's about doing the research, covering the facts.
[01:01:51.632 --> 01:01:52.092]  Period.
[01:01:56.235 --> 01:01:59.737]  Now before we go any further, I just want to give you a preview
[01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:03.889]  Some of the other news we're going to be breaking down.
[01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:11.291]  Appeals court rules cops can track your cell phone without a warrant.
[01:02:11.331 --> 01:02:14.871]  So another appeals court said that it's illegal what the NSA is doing.
[01:02:16.472 --> 01:02:19.052]  But then another one comes out and says basically they can.
[01:02:19.112 --> 01:02:23.373]  Ruling sets precedent for unconstitutional collection of private data.
[01:02:23.393 --> 01:02:29.194]  They just grab and steal your cell phone data, no nothing, no judge, no jury, no probable cause, and then put it in databases.
[01:02:30.728 --> 01:02:32.169]  The Atlanta-based, 11th Circuit, U.S.
[01:02:32.189 --> 01:02:37.392]  Court of Appeals has ruled police no longer need a court-issued search warrant to use cell phone location records.
[01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:48.418]  Notice that they did this secretly and put all these stingrays up and things like that and said, no, those don't belong to police, lying to us!
[01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:53.741]  And then now they get caught doing something that's illegal, so they try to go to the courts and get them to say it's okay.
[01:02:56.142 --> 01:02:57.763]  And it wasn't like it was a close decision.
[01:02:59.465 --> 01:03:03.828]  The 9-2 decision came earlier this week in the case of Miami robbery suspect.
[01:03:05.028 --> 01:03:11.952]  Cell phone records, which used to connect Davis to a number of armed robberies, which he received a 162-year prison sentence.
[01:03:12.472 --> 01:03:13.553]  And look, it sounds great.
[01:03:14.093 --> 01:03:15.174]  You got a cell phone.
[01:03:18.136 --> 01:03:19.857]  You committed the crimes.
[01:03:19.877 --> 01:03:22.358]  You're an idiot and don't know that it links you to all of it.
[01:03:23.639 --> 01:03:25.340]  Well, then go get a warrant.
[01:03:28.297 --> 01:03:29.518]  Don't just use it.
[01:03:29.598 --> 01:03:30.859]  Don't just pre-collect it.
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:32.221]  Because here's the deal.
[01:03:32.281 --> 01:03:34.002]  They can plant stuff in the future.
[01:03:34.022 --> 01:03:36.465]  They can track and control behavior.
[01:03:36.505 --> 01:03:37.706]  They can tax you with this.
[01:03:38.086 --> 01:03:40.488]  There's a reason stuff like this has been illegal.
[01:03:41.409 --> 01:03:42.090]  With low-tech.
[01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:46.073]  And now with high-tech it makes it hundreds of times worse.
[01:03:46.113 --> 01:03:48.436]  I mean, it is just nightmare what's going on.
[01:03:49.286 --> 01:03:58.499]  The major corporations are getting all this data together and then they can game the economy, they can shut down markets, they can... It is just so bad in the hands of the New World Order.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.984]  Can you imagine dictators with this power in the past?
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:09.482]  The court ruled that Davis had no expectation of privacy in regard to location records generated by cell towers.
[01:04:09.522 --> 01:04:19.607]  So now, saying, you know, you can be filmed in public, well now, just your cell phone has this Trojan horse tech that watches you, listens to you, tracks everything you do, tracks where you go.
[01:04:19.627 --> 01:04:22.108]  Of course, forever, oh, we're not watching you.
[01:04:22.908 --> 01:04:24.088]  We're not tracking you.
[01:04:24.889 --> 01:04:26.109]  We're not following you.
[01:04:26.189 --> 01:04:26.890]  None of that's going on.
[01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:28.330]  That's crazy Alex Jones stuff.
[01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:28.911]  Oh, really?
[01:04:28.951 --> 01:04:29.651]  Here's the documents.
[01:04:31.846 --> 01:04:34.148]  And then now, they just go, of course we are!
[01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:42.634]  Meanwhile, Obama is waging all-out war on the press like no other president ever has.
[01:04:42.654 --> 01:04:46.517]  This is just part of the atmosphere of tyranny we're in, that they say don't worry about.
[01:04:46.837 --> 01:04:49.159]  Obama is more hostile towards the press than any other president in history.
[01:04:49.199 --> 01:04:50.680]  We'll be breaking that down.
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:05:00.188]  Motels are gathering all the guest data and running it through police systems, which is basically, cops get in trouble if they do that to you without a probable cause.
[01:05:00.888 --> 01:05:05.172]  And they got a percentage of the bounty on people if it pops up.
[01:05:05.212 --> 01:05:06.713]  So folks, you know about that as well.
[01:05:07.013 --> 01:05:07.554]  Stay with us.
[01:05:09.635 --> 01:05:12.558]  Is ISIS targeting states with strict gun control laws?
[01:05:12.818 --> 01:05:17.042]  ISIS reportedly released a list of five states it's ready to attack.
[01:05:17.202 --> 01:05:21.145]  Three of which have some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation.
[01:05:21.365 --> 01:05:27.010]  Now the states which were named in a message signed by Abu Ibram and shared on Twitter included California.
[01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:30.452]  Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, and Virginia.
[01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:37.518]  Now, four out of those five states listed have passing grades from groups that support more gun control and disarming the populace.
[01:05:37.778 --> 01:05:45.824]  Meanwhile, in a place like Texas, where everyone is pretty much armed to the teeth, ISIS showed up and two of those guys got taken out pretty quickly.
[01:05:45.964 --> 01:05:48.466]  This is why everyone needs to be able to have a gun.
[01:05:48.706 --> 01:06:02.170]  And according to a state ranking from Guns and Ammo, which lists the best state for gun owners at number one, and the strictest gun control state at number 50, California, Maryland, and Illinois are ranked 46, 44, and 41 respectively.
[01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:05.331]  Now the other two states, Michigan and Virginia, are ranked around the middle of the pack.
[01:06:05.531 --> 01:06:08.592]  You can find more stories like this at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:09.412 --> 01:06:11.855]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:12.056 --> 01:06:13.077]  Check it out today.
[01:06:13.537 --> 01:06:21.747]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none, and that's what you'll find at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:21.928 --> 01:06:28.896]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest
[01:06:28.916 --> 01:06:29.096]  I don't
[01:06:49.844 --> 01:06:50.384]  We're good.
[01:07:09.284 --> 01:07:13.165]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:07:13.185 --> 01:07:16.746]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:07:17.006 --> 01:07:19.847]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:07:20.027 --> 01:07:27.249]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:07:27.469 --> 01:07:31.072]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:07:31.332 --> 01:07:35.535]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:07:35.695 --> 01:07:41.539]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:07:41.579 --> 01:07:45.542]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:07:45.602 --> 01:07:47.984]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:49.525]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:07:49.645 --> 01:07:50.866]  It's time to take action.
[01:07:51.006 --> 01:07:52.627]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:08:01.351 --> 01:08:05.493]  Again, that's InfoWarsStore.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[01:08:05.613 --> 01:08:11.856]  As the community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[01:08:17.586 --> 01:08:26.712]  That's veteran Denver Police Officer Charles Jones IV smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times.
[01:08:26.812 --> 01:08:30.995]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence.
[01:08:31.015 --> 01:08:33.656]  I'm observing what they're doing and they're all shaking.
[01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:36.058]  I don't understand what's going on.
[01:08:36.098 --> 01:08:45.364]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio, and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:53.814]  It doesn't raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government.
[01:08:54.114 --> 01:08:55.936]  How can you ask such a question?
[01:08:55.956 --> 01:08:58.538]  What difference at this point does it make?
[01:08:58.598 --> 01:09:05.684]  When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in a community, he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases.
[01:09:05.704 --> 01:09:13.310]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[01:09:14.474 --> 01:09:16.416]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[01:09:16.697 --> 01:09:17.858]  What I say, go.
[01:09:18.018 --> 01:09:18.419]  See?
[01:09:18.879 --> 01:09:20.761]  I'm the law around here.
[01:09:23.124 --> 01:09:25.307]  He came, he saw, he died.
[01:09:28.354 --> 01:09:34.535]  Yes, in modern warfare, our military leaders are finding that words and ideas are highly effective weapons.
[01:09:35.015 --> 01:09:36.795]  You just have to be repetitive about this.
[01:09:36.815 --> 01:09:43.777]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:09:44.137 --> 01:09:46.397]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[01:09:46.497 --> 01:09:48.157]  You really don't have to trust me.
[01:09:48.177 --> 01:09:48.978]  You shouldn't trust me.
[01:09:48.998 --> 01:09:52.978]  In fact, by my actually participating in that, I will taint the news.
[01:09:53.078 --> 01:09:56.299]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:04.165]  Nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[01:10:04.566 --> 01:10:09.531]  Oh goodness you, well we're going to do everything we can to help you.
[01:10:09.551 --> 01:10:12.854]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:10:13.494 --> 01:10:16.137]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:10:16.197 --> 01:10:18.960]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:30.100]  We are joined, ladies and gentlemen, kicking off this second hour by a representative from Maine in the Statehouse, David Sawicki.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:37.042]  MaineVaxChoice.org, N-V-I-C dot O-R-G.
[01:10:37.062 --> 01:10:42.985]  And Representative Sawicki's taking action from
[01:10:44.485 --> 01:10:57.310]  New Hampshire, of all places, to California, from Illinois to Texas, they've introduced bills, some of which are moving through the legislature, some of which are going to the governors, to force men, women, and children, everybody to take vaccines.
[01:10:58.691 --> 01:11:05.333]  They're holding back, just like you have, you can save a few thousand dollars a year per child on the tax credit exemption.
[01:11:05.613 --> 01:11:07.434]  They're trying to take that away in Australia.
[01:11:07.934 --> 01:11:09.475]  Notice they're now proposing that here.
[01:11:09.555 --> 01:11:11.856]  See, it's globally standardized.
[01:11:14.525 --> 01:11:23.612]  We had shocking news on Monday from eyewitness RN nurses and others that when they give the preemie babies under orders vaccines now they have to innovate them.
[01:11:23.632 --> 01:11:24.253]  They stop breathing.
[01:11:24.293 --> 01:11:25.073]  They start dying.
[01:11:25.093 --> 01:11:26.655]  In fact, they would die.
[01:11:28.816 --> 01:11:31.058]  Vaccines kill children until they're resuscitated.
[01:11:32.439 --> 01:11:34.981]  You can't bring up a shocking enough headline.
[01:11:36.462 --> 01:11:38.224]  The companies have liability protection.
[01:11:41.311 --> 01:11:43.253]  And there's hundreds of vaccines they want you to take.
[01:11:43.353 --> 01:11:44.775]  Fifty they're claiming are mandatory.
[01:11:45.295 --> 01:11:52.843]  They're not taking rural families' children in Kentucky because they're not vaccinated.
[01:11:54.325 --> 01:11:54.945]  There's no law.
[01:11:55.666 --> 01:11:59.590]  So they're trying to pass laws because they're hoaxes the law is following through.
[01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:00.471]  You say, well, how do they do that?
[01:12:00.772 --> 01:12:01.793]  They just claim it's abuse.
[01:12:03.659 --> 01:12:05.160]  They label abuse however they want.
[01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:09.684]  Oh, you're not, you know, teaching your kid a particular religion.
[01:12:09.704 --> 01:12:12.827]  You're not teaching them that Heather should have two mommies or shouldn't.
[01:12:13.848 --> 01:12:15.269]  The state runs your kids now.
[01:12:15.329 --> 01:12:16.770]  This is classical tyranny.
[01:12:18.692 --> 01:12:20.013]  MainVaxChoice.org.
[01:12:20.053 --> 01:12:26.399]  So there are valiant people, like Representative David Ciewiecki, who are out there introducing the legislation.
[01:12:26.419 --> 01:12:29.001]  We're going to tell you about this legislation that needs your support.
[01:12:32.404 --> 01:12:37.547]  And other bad legislation that they're fighting at the Maine Coalition for Vaccine Choice.
[01:12:37.587 --> 01:12:39.969]  And believe me, you're like, why do I care about Maine?
[01:12:39.989 --> 01:12:41.189]  You better care about Maine.
[01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:43.511]  Because the fight's on.
[01:12:46.212 --> 01:12:48.574]  Texas has forced stuff they're trying to pass.
[01:12:49.094 --> 01:12:49.494]  It's on.
[01:12:50.195 --> 01:12:51.556]  And if we don't fight it, they'll win.
[01:12:53.337 --> 01:12:56.599]  Just like the TPP, they're trying to give Obama fast track on it.
[01:12:58.661 --> 01:13:01.002]  Under the UN treaties, we know there's gun control in there.
[01:13:01.282 --> 01:13:02.583]  We've got to shoot that down as well.
[01:13:05.284 --> 01:13:09.947]  So joining us from 127th Maine Legislature, David Sawicki, Representative.
[01:13:10.307 --> 01:13:12.068]  Thank you so much for coming on with us, sir.
[01:13:12.868 --> 01:13:14.869]  Alex, I really appreciate you giving me this opportunity.
[01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.810]  We appreciate you.
[01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:16.730]  Well, you've got the floor.
[01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:17.831]  You know I'll run over, folks.
[01:13:18.151 --> 01:13:22.373]  Tell folks about the bad bills, the good bills, where this fight's going, and what we can do.
[01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:48.042]  Well, I was inspired to put my bill in because I read in the newspaper a few days before the time period to submit bills was closing, it was just a couple of days, and there was an article in the paper, Lewis & Son Journal, about LD-606, which was an act to remove the philosophical exemption from the immunization requirements for school students and employees of nursery schools and healthcare facilities.
[01:13:48.729 --> 01:13:50.510]  So that's a bill in the works here.
[01:13:51.351 --> 01:14:01.119]  And there was another bill as well that would remove, actually make it more difficult to ask for a philosophical exemption.
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:06.763]  And then I started seeing the very same types of bills being introduced in other states.
[01:14:07.684 --> 01:14:09.986]  And so I just wanted to try to cut this off the past.
[01:14:10.026 --> 01:14:13.969]  I think it's a very simple concept to understand that at the end of the day,
[01:14:14.727 --> 01:14:16.108]  You know, we are sovereign.
[01:14:16.488 --> 01:14:25.952]  This is our body, and we must always assert the right to allow or not allow what we want to come into our body, including a vaccine.
[01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:30.390]  Well think about the precedent it sets.
[01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:33.411]  They're acting like we're crazy because we don't want to be forcibly inoculated.
[01:14:34.031 --> 01:14:38.453]  I don't know of any country in the world that has laws like this except maybe North Korea.
[01:14:38.713 --> 01:14:46.014]  I saw last week ISIS is promising to forcibly vaccinate all these different Arab countries they've invaded.
[01:14:46.034 --> 01:14:47.775]  So I guess the U.S.
[01:14:47.815 --> 01:14:52.436]  is the only other country to be joining ISIS and its Islamic State for forced inoculation.
[01:14:52.476 --> 01:14:53.556]  Just totally bizarre.
[01:14:53.976 --> 01:14:55.937]  And now they even call these vaccines
[01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:04.424]  It's a whole other class of things now being brought in, and just ignoring all the problems.
[01:15:05.485 --> 01:15:08.447]  Why do you think they're on such an offense to make this the law?
[01:15:09.628 --> 01:15:10.788]  I really think it comes down to money.
[01:15:11.209 --> 01:15:13.991]  I really think it comes down to big pharma money.
[01:15:14.671 --> 01:15:26.259]  And if you can mandate every man, woman, and child has to receive 20, 40, 60, you know, just keep growing the list every few years, it's a significant, significant income stream going to those pharma companies.
[01:15:28.627 --> 01:15:42.752]  Walking through this for us, I mean when you're there in the legislature putting on a presentation or in a committee, go over the facts for us, because, and again, give listeners the different bill numbers and the best ways to defeat this legislation.
[01:15:43.713 --> 01:15:47.174]  Great, well, you know, legislatures love to give feedback.
[01:15:47.874 --> 01:15:57.238]  So you can go to Maine.gov and just find the legislatures out there, get their email addresses, send them messages, both sides, Republican, Democrats,
[01:15:58.685 --> 01:16:07.114]  The two bills that are restricting or limiting or removing rights are LD-471 and LD-606.
[01:16:09.336 --> 01:16:15.763]  My bill is LD-950, and my objective in writing this bill was to make it as brief as the Second Amendment.
[01:16:15.783 --> 01:16:17.485]  So I'm just going to quickly read this to you.
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:29.460]  LD950, notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person, employer, or educational institution may not discriminate against an individual because that individual has refused a vaccination.
[01:16:30.441 --> 01:16:30.742]  That's it.
[01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:45.039]  And if it passes your legislature, we can take their offense and turn it into an offense for us and get a mirror bill that's so clean passed all across the country.
[01:16:45.099 --> 01:16:48.260]  So LD950 at Maine.gov.
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:50.461]  Folks need to get that bill.
[01:16:50.961 --> 01:16:52.962]  Send it to your legislature as well.
[01:16:53.602 --> 01:16:55.903]  California was set to pass it out of committee.
[01:16:56.443 --> 01:17:04.106]  And the fight's still on, but when a thousand people showed up, they shut it down and kicked the can down the road a few weeks hoping pressure went away.
[01:17:04.466 --> 01:17:07.287]  So the truth is, when we put pressure on them, it has an effect, doesn't it?
[01:17:08.007 --> 01:17:10.528]  Oh yeah, and there's another thing that people can do if they're in the area.
[01:17:10.888 --> 01:17:14.209]  On Monday, May 11th, RFK Jr.
[01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:21.992]  is making an appearance at the Statehouse on this topic, and there'll be a rally at 12 noon, and there are people coming from all over the state, I know.
[01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:29.442]  Parents who've had, you know, damages or even death caused to their children, various speakers.
[01:17:30.203 --> 01:17:33.607]  So it's going to be a big event Monday, Augusta, 12 p.m., May 11.
[01:17:36.837 --> 01:17:46.341]  Well, if you're in that state or surrounding areas, ladies and gentlemen, it is your duty to get out there because medical tyranny, whether it's Obamacare, you name it, is here.
[01:17:47.042 --> 01:17:56.066]  And if these big corporations can just force us to buy their products and have liability protection, it'd be like if Ford made you buy a truck or Chevy or Toyota that blew up.
[01:17:56.646 --> 01:17:58.447]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:17:59.187 --> 01:18:01.171]  There's so many people damaged by these.
[01:18:01.211 --> 01:18:02.533]  There's so much evidence.
[01:18:02.573 --> 01:18:06.820]  There's so many of these cases being settled by the Vaccine Damage Court secretly.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:10.266]  And as we go from 1 in 30,000 having autism to 1 in 56...
[01:18:12.438 --> 01:18:16.041]  And they say by 2025 it's going to be 1 in 10, sir, Representative.
[01:18:17.823 --> 01:18:23.227]  What do you think, how is Big Pharma going to navigate the amount of damage they're causing?
[01:18:23.528 --> 01:18:34.017]  Don't they know that in the end they're causing so much damage that I don't care if you're liberal or conservative or libertarian, you brain damage somebody's kid, they're going to get active.
[01:18:35.097 --> 01:18:36.999]  Absolutely, and those are the people who are motivated.
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:39.101]  I have a child.
[01:18:39.795 --> 01:18:43.537]  Who developed type 1 diabetes shortly after getting the MMR vaccine.
[01:18:44.157 --> 01:18:46.478]  And we weren't that well-versed on this topic at the time.
[01:18:46.518 --> 01:18:49.059]  We were really digging into diabetes and how to manage it.
[01:18:49.139 --> 01:18:52.881]  And then we started seeing these cross-referenced articles mentioning vaccines.
[01:18:52.921 --> 01:19:04.026]  And sure enough, on the, I believe, I won't say the company, but on the MMR vaccine insert, it says type 1 diabetes is listed as one of the potential side effects.
[01:19:05.747 --> 01:19:07.191]  I'm getting chills, I really am.
[01:19:07.211 --> 01:19:12.106]  I have a good friend who's wonderful little daughter that's friends with my daughter.
[01:19:13.366 --> 01:19:20.728]  Um, got our vaccines and developed, they said, oh, type 1 diabetes, and at Dell's Children's Center, they said, yeah, we think it's the vaccines.
[01:19:21.208 --> 01:19:26.450]  We've got hundreds of kids in here now every year when school starts, and it's causing pancreatitis.
[01:19:27.250 --> 01:19:31.551]  And I talked to my dad, who's just a dentist and a chemist, and he goes, he goes, oh, yeah, everybody knows that.
[01:19:31.611 --> 01:19:33.671]  It causes an autoimmune response to the brain and the pancreas.
[01:19:34.152 --> 01:19:34.832]  They know!
[01:19:35.692 --> 01:19:37.053]  And then they tell you it's genetic.
[01:19:37.093 --> 01:19:39.775]  Well, yeah, it's genetic if you fry somebody's pancreas.
[01:19:40.935 --> 01:19:41.896]  I'm sorry, just stay there.
[01:19:42.877 --> 01:19:45.218]  Again, folks, they're going to tell you it's genetic.
[01:19:45.859 --> 01:19:49.861]  Well, yeah, you can be predisposed to get lung cancer if you smoke two packs of cigarettes a day.
[01:19:50.462 --> 01:19:52.803]  But the cigarettes are what gave you the lung cancer.
[01:19:53.504 --> 01:19:56.906]  Same thing, you can be predisposed to type 1 diabetes if you get pancreatitis.
[01:19:56.946 --> 01:19:58.387]  Well, it gives you pancreatitis.
[01:19:58.667 --> 01:20:00.188]  In fact, bring me the MMR sheet.
[01:20:00.248 --> 01:20:00.828]  I forgot that.
[01:20:00.848 --> 01:20:01.909]  We've got the actual sheet.
[01:20:02.289 --> 01:20:02.810]  Stay there, sir.
[01:20:03.611 --> 01:20:05.536]  I didn't even know that his daughter was a casualty of this.
[01:20:05.576 --> 01:20:06.258]  See what I'm talking about?
[01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:19.352]  So Mark and I are out at the range shooting our AR-15 rifles built from AR-15 kits from Guns80.com when Dave walks up and he says, Hey, did you guys hear about Jade Helm?
[01:20:19.572 --> 01:20:25.673]  You know, the government doesn't care about the Posse Comitatus Act and Jade Helm, the troops are going to come and they may come after us and blah, blah, blah.
[01:20:25.713 --> 01:20:28.853]  And I'm thinking, Oh my God, dude, look, I take a 30 shot magazine.
[01:20:28.873 --> 01:20:32.194]  I put it in my AR-15 built from a kit from Guns80.com.
[01:20:32.254 --> 01:20:33.394]  I unload it on the target.
[01:20:33.614 --> 01:20:34.214]  Jade Helm?
[01:20:34.454 --> 01:20:35.094]  I mean, really?
[01:20:35.294 --> 01:20:35.834]  Guns80.com.

[01:20:39.855 --> 01:20:49.102]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:20:49.162 --> 01:20:49.883]  This capitalism?
[01:20:49.963 --> 01:20:56.067]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:20:56.127 --> 01:20:59.770]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:36.403]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:24:36.623 --> 01:24:45.129]  And we're joined by Maine Representative David Sawicki, who's introduced the Bill 950, to say you cannot forcibly inoculate the people.
[01:24:45.450 --> 01:24:46.470]  It's a great, simple bill.
[01:24:46.931 --> 01:24:49.713]  Folks should get it and try to get it passed in their legislatures preemptively.
[01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:55.813]  They've got bills introduced all over the country to make us take hundreds of vaccines, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:57.094 --> 01:25:06.302]  Now, if you look at this MMR vaccine, the one that is giving people type 1 diabetes across the country, that again, they claim is genetic.
[01:25:07.303 --> 01:25:10.345]  Well, yeah, I mean, if you shoot me in the head with a .45, I'll genetically bleed out.
[01:25:10.906 --> 01:25:12.287]  I'm designed genetically to die from that.
[01:25:13.328 --> 01:25:15.709]  Or if I eat 14 hamburgers a day, I'll have a heart attack.
[01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:17.311]  I mean, you know, come on.
[01:25:18.444 --> 01:25:18.824]  Here it is.
[01:25:19.064 --> 01:25:19.985]  Pancreatitis.
[01:25:20.085 --> 01:25:28.671]  And then once you get the pancreatitis, diarrhea, vomiting, endocrine system shutdown, then you get diabetes.
[01:25:28.851 --> 01:25:30.452]  It says diabetes.
[01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:32.173]  Just diabetes!
[01:25:34.314 --> 01:25:34.995]  How do you pronounce that?
[01:25:35.075 --> 01:25:38.197]  Diabetes mellitus.
[01:25:39.697 --> 01:25:40.178]  Melitis.
[01:25:40.358 --> 01:25:40.818]  Melitis.
[01:25:41.859 --> 01:25:43.060]  Diabetes mellitus.
[01:25:44.349 --> 01:25:46.551]  And then over here it describes how it can kill you.
[01:25:47.132 --> 01:25:48.273]  This is the Merck & Co.
[01:25:49.014 --> 01:25:50.856]  Oh, the news says they're safe and effective.
[01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:52.017]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:25:52.417 --> 01:25:52.918]  There it is.
[01:25:53.698 --> 01:25:56.141]  Well, that's just outrageous, Representative Ciewiecki.
[01:25:56.181 --> 01:25:59.624]  I had no idea that this would hit your daughter as well, and that was the point I was going to.
[01:26:01.158 --> 01:26:06.922]  Is that they're not going to be able to cover this up when one in ten kids can't talk.
[01:26:08.323 --> 01:26:09.444]  Where do you think they're going?
[01:26:09.484 --> 01:26:18.211]  I mean, when all this ends up coming out, I want these executives, just like Bayer executives got caught for a decade shipping out Factor VIII to hemophiliacs globally.
[01:26:18.451 --> 01:26:20.152]  They knew had HIV and hepatitis in it.
[01:26:20.713 --> 01:26:22.474]  They only got prison sentences in France.
[01:26:22.614 --> 01:26:24.696]  I'd like to see these people in prison.
[01:26:25.276 --> 01:26:30.080]  We need to get on the offense here, because I think they're on the offense knowing people are waking up.
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:31.060]  What do you think's happening?
[01:26:31.941 --> 01:26:38.886]  Well, we have the Supreme Court ruling that basically gave them immunity shields.
[01:26:39.306 --> 01:26:39.907]  Excuse the pun.
[01:26:40.927 --> 01:26:42.208]  You're familiar with that, of course, right?
[01:26:42.429 --> 01:26:42.629]  Yes.
[01:26:43.559 --> 01:26:45.740]  So, I mean, that was a Supreme Court decision.
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:27:00.025]  We would have to maybe have a class action suit for a specific vaccine, possibly the MMR vaccine, show all these connections between that vaccine and a specific disease that didn't exist prior to the vaccine.
[01:27:00.645 --> 01:27:09.288]  That's just one idea, but the government needs to understand how many people are behind this and how passionate they are, and that
[01:27:09.887 --> 01:27:13.349]  There's a lot of truth behind the damage being caused by these vaccines.
[01:27:13.369 --> 01:27:14.030]  There's research.
[01:27:14.050 --> 01:27:17.972]  There's research that proves that.
[01:27:17.992 --> 01:27:28.159]  Talking about the efficacy of vaccines, I shared an article with your producer about polio because people keep asking me, well, what about polio?
[01:27:28.179 --> 01:27:33.843]  If we didn't have the polio immunization program, we'd be having polio running rampant in our country.
[01:27:34.103 --> 01:27:35.544]  People dying, going into iron lungs.
[01:27:36.545 --> 01:27:38.526]  And this article that I shared is
[01:27:39.332 --> 01:27:42.115]  Really damaging to that case.
[01:27:42.135 --> 01:27:43.996]  I'll just read a couple of things here.
[01:27:44.056 --> 01:27:49.301]  They did a study of polio cases in several states before and after immunization.
[01:27:50.102 --> 01:27:51.683]  For example, this is the 1950s.
[01:27:52.323 --> 01:28:00.230]  After mass inoculation, let's see, Rhode Island reported 22 cases before inoculation of polio versus 122 cases the next year.
[01:28:00.250 --> 01:28:00.811]  A 454% increase.
[01:28:00.831 --> 01:28:01.411]  In Massachusetts,
[01:28:06.061 --> 01:28:09.183]  Pre-inoculation for polio, they had 273 cases.
[01:28:09.904 --> 01:28:12.525]  After the inoculation, it was 2,027.
[01:28:13.766 --> 01:28:14.567]  642% increase.
[01:28:15.027 --> 01:28:25.454]  Dr. Salk has been quoted in the Washington Post, 1976, the developer of the vaccine for polio, testified that the live virus vaccine
[01:28:26.095 --> 01:28:28.016]  And you're reading out of major medical journals.
[01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:30.377]  We have those on screen in a boiled-down medical paper.
[01:28:30.397 --> 01:28:32.098]  My grandmother had had one vaccine
[01:28:52.185 --> 01:28:53.006]  for the polio.
[01:28:53.386 --> 01:28:59.571]  Then they said, Benny, this is in 1951, my mother was five years old, four years old, my uncle was 10.
[01:29:01.712 --> 01:29:04.614]  She said, you need to take the new strain.
[01:29:05.275 --> 01:29:11.019]  She took it and two weeks later, she had polio and was almost put in an iron lung, lost half the muscles.
[01:29:11.579 --> 01:29:15.462]  She's almost 90 years old today, but I mean, it just wrecked her life to a great extent.
[01:29:16.203 --> 01:29:21.227]  And she was just a beautiful, beautiful woman, still is, but I mean, it just absolutely really changed our family.
[01:29:22.543 --> 01:29:25.667]  And they just lie about it, and it's so frustrating.
[01:29:25.687 --> 01:29:31.393]  Well, everybody's got to get behind your piece of legislation to get you the co-sponsors to get this through.
[01:29:31.413 --> 01:29:37.780]  I want to invite you on next week, sir, for an in-depth report to tell your story and more, so we can warn others.
[01:29:38.361 --> 01:29:39.262]  It, again, is Bill 950.
[01:29:41.924 --> 01:29:45.047]  LD950, 127th Maine Legislature.
[01:29:45.788 --> 01:29:49.191]  It's an act to prohibit discrimination against a person who is not vaccinated.
[01:29:50.912 --> 01:29:53.014]  Representative David Sawicki, we salute you.
[01:29:53.094 --> 01:29:53.394]  Thank you.
[01:29:53.414 --> 01:29:54.355]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:29:54.976 --> 01:29:55.856]  Good talk to you, Alex.
[01:29:55.976 --> 01:29:56.437]  Thank you, sir.
[01:29:56.797 --> 01:29:58.298]  Let's warn others before they hurt more children.
[01:29:58.939 --> 01:29:59.840]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:01.942]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.862 --> 01:30:05.545]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.821 --> 01:30:13.626]  Secret deal could contain a maraud of gun restrictions and ammo bans.
[01:30:13.806 --> 01:30:15.929]  This is an article by Gun Owners of America.
[01:30:16.109 --> 01:30:24.499]  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Orrin Hatch may soon give the president authority to write gun control restrictions into a trade agreement.
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:27.243]  Counterterrorism unit eyed vegan potlucks.
[01:30:27.423 --> 01:30:30.745]  This is an article posted by Mikhail Thelen of Infowars.com.
[01:30:57.703 --> 01:30:58.344]  We're good.
[01:31:09.751 --> 01:31:11.012]  I want more candy!
[01:31:11.032 --> 01:31:11.692]  I want more video games!
[01:31:12.013 --> 01:31:12.533]  Mine!
[01:31:12.793 --> 01:31:12.893]  Mine!
[01:31:12.913 --> 01:31:13.013]  Mine!
[01:31:39.571 --> 01:31:40.351]  I think so.
[01:32:09.549 --> 01:32:19.078]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:32:19.218 --> 01:32:28.967]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:32:29.147 --> 01:32:32.070]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.891]  I think so.
[01:32:47.312 --> 01:32:47.672]  I think so.
[01:33:11.627 --> 01:33:13.548]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:33:14.028 --> 01:33:14.508]  A lie!
[01:33:14.928 --> 01:33:16.629]  No man is obsolete!
[01:33:16.929 --> 01:33:18.749]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:33:18.789 --> 01:33:21.690]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[01:33:22.050 --> 01:33:27.152]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[01:33:27.492 --> 01:33:29.152]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:33:29.192 --> 01:33:30.313]  A crawling insect!
[01:33:30.673 --> 01:33:34.734]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[01:33:35.334 --> 01:33:36.436]  I am a human being.
[01:33:36.836 --> 01:33:44.044]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind.
[01:33:44.605 --> 01:33:45.305]  I don't care.
[01:33:45.746 --> 01:33:46.767]  I tell you, I don't care.
[01:33:46.787 --> 01:33:48.128]  I'm a human being.
[01:33:48.148 --> 01:33:48.889]  I exist.
[01:33:48.989 --> 01:33:53.094]  And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives.
[01:33:53.837 --> 01:33:55.519]  Even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[01:33:56.039 --> 01:33:58.761]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:33:59.202 --> 01:34:06.608]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all!
[01:34:06.888 --> 01:34:09.430]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream!
[01:34:09.851 --> 01:34:12.273]  And the state has no use for your kind!
[01:34:13.954 --> 01:34:17.457]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:34:18.038 --> 01:34:19.779]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:26.835 --> 01:34:51.233]  Last week we had the prestigious professor John Laudon of More Guns Less Crime, and he was warning of a major new offensive being launched by the anti-gunners, the Brady Campaign, the Violence Policy Center, the George Soros groups, with a bunch of fake science being cooked up to claim that guns are causing waves of shootings, when in truth,
[01:34:52.523 --> 01:34:59.726]  He was saying, the numbers we have from the Justice Department are about 52% mass shootings and general shootings down since 1992.
[01:35:01.387 --> 01:35:05.028]  He was saying though, that's how the Justice Department cooks them, it's more like 60.
[01:35:06.789 --> 01:35:20.155]  But we all saw in the news a month ago where it was admitted that the FBI cooked numbers under orders on mass shootings from the Justice Department to brainwash the public as the Attorney General publicly said they would do.
[01:35:21.598 --> 01:35:41.226]  Now joining us is the man in the middle of it all, right there on Capitol Hill, every day, tracking what's happening, the conscience of the NRA, as NRA board member Ted Nugent has said, without GOA, the NRA wouldn't have made their more hardcore turn, thank God, in the last three or four years.
[01:35:42.046 --> 01:35:43.587]  And I'm not bragging, it's a fact.
[01:35:43.627 --> 01:35:52.455]  A decade ago, I really pushed Larry Pratt, who's a classy gentleman, to go after the NRA and their milquetoast board to get on the offense.
[01:35:52.515 --> 01:35:53.235]  And that's happened?
[01:35:53.255 --> 01:35:56.658]  Their rhetoric has matched the reality of the tyranny we're facing?
[01:35:57.279 --> 01:36:01.562]  Sure, I mean, saying Obama's becoming a dictator sounds radical, but it's true.
[01:36:02.963 --> 01:36:06.726]  Open borders, Benghazi, Fast and Furious, IRSK.
[01:36:07.767 --> 01:36:09.809]  You have to match the reality with the rhetoric.
[01:36:13.621 --> 01:36:17.582]  A lot of times people end up going under tyranny because they just can't believe it's happening to them.
[01:36:18.162 --> 01:36:19.563]  And that's in basic criminology.
[01:36:20.963 --> 01:36:23.924]  We know Obama promised to sign on to the UN Treaty.
[01:36:24.604 --> 01:36:29.806]  We know Obama promised to use executive power and other international agreements to go after the Second Amendment.
[01:36:30.986 --> 01:36:32.167]  They're banning imports.
[01:36:32.187 --> 01:36:33.207]  They're going after ammo.
[01:36:33.247 --> 01:36:35.968]  They're not letting the military sell the brass like they used to do.
[01:36:37.688 --> 01:36:38.548]  There's a whole program.
[01:36:38.568 --> 01:36:40.249]  They've got the ATFRS and gun shops.
[01:36:41.607 --> 01:36:45.150]  Veterans are being put on no-buy lists with no evidence of anything.
[01:36:45.871 --> 01:36:55.740]  There is a major cold war against the Second Amendment, but Lott said, get ready, the new offensive is going to launch in the next few months into the campaign.
[01:36:56.661 --> 01:37:01.025]  The expert, Larry Pratt of GunOwners.org joins us to the end of the hour.
[01:37:01.505 --> 01:37:04.068]  They have a powerful article at GunOwners.org.
[01:37:04.528 --> 01:37:06.370]  The story is mirrored at InfoWars.com.
[01:37:08.191 --> 01:37:12.334]  And I want to give him the floor as best I can to break all this down.
[01:37:12.414 --> 01:37:20.540]  Headline, secret deal could contain a myriad of gun control restrictions, ammo bans, will you install gun control be rammed on our throats?
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:26.344]  And then we've got the quotes of people in the system saying they'll use this to do it, and it's secret.
[01:37:26.744 --> 01:37:27.905]  Congress can't see it.
[01:37:28.285 --> 01:37:30.687]  They're trying to give the president fast track authority.
[01:37:31.287 --> 01:37:33.448]  WikiLeaks stole, to their credit,
[01:37:34.749 --> 01:37:41.914]  The Death Star plans last year, but because they're leftist though, only leaked the internet provision that's worse than SOPA and CISPA.
[01:37:43.555 --> 01:37:44.576]  So, it's on.
[01:37:44.656 --> 01:37:48.379]  Internet taxes, regulations, internet IDs, it's on.
[01:37:49.339 --> 01:37:52.882]  Just like your cell phone tracks you, the internet now will no way to get around it.
[01:37:53.829 --> 01:37:54.249]  It's on.
[01:37:54.309 --> 01:37:59.752]  So Larry Pratt, I think it's clear to say the next imperial offensive against the Republic is on.
[01:38:00.152 --> 01:38:02.554]  You're the general up there in the war room.
[01:38:02.834 --> 01:38:08.377]  Please give us the breakdown on exactly what cocktail of attacks are coming and what this secret treaty means.
[01:38:09.788 --> 01:38:12.569]  Hi Alex, thanks so much for having an interest in this.
[01:38:12.929 --> 01:38:14.350]  I think that's going to be very helpful.
[01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:23.694]  The members of Congress, at least some of the more liberal ones, might say, well yeah, you can find out what's in the proposed treaty.
[01:38:25.134 --> 01:38:25.935]  Yeah, right.
[01:38:26.375 --> 01:38:33.938]  You can go to a locked room in a basement, surrendering your cell phone before you get there.
[01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:38.543]  No pictures, no dictating notes to anybody.
[01:38:39.163 --> 01:38:40.384]  Nothing with which to write.
[01:38:41.044 --> 01:38:46.486]  And then you may look at the proposed legislation one section at a time.
[01:38:47.486 --> 01:38:52.107]  And this is from the most open administration ever.
[01:38:56.429 --> 01:39:00.190]  I guess we have to laugh, otherwise we'd be in a white suit coat.
[01:39:01.325 --> 01:39:13.313]  This is just absolutely outrageous and one of the dangers, and there's got to be a myriad of dangers in this approach to legislation, but right now the bill is amendable.
[01:39:13.653 --> 01:39:20.398]  It's just a bill and it's going to give authority to the President to negotiate a treaty.
[01:39:20.418 --> 01:39:25.261]  And when that treaty comes back, the way this thing is being set up,
[01:39:26.212 --> 01:39:30.518]  It'll take two-thirds of the Senate to overturn whatever might be in there.
[01:39:30.958 --> 01:39:31.679]  No amendments.
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:39.669]  And so, this is the time to make any, say, protection amendments for the Second Amendment.
[01:39:40.183 --> 01:40:04.795]  And so far, we haven't been able to get this of enough concern for a member of the Senate to say, okay, yeah, we gotta put in an amendment blocking anything to do with ammunition or firearms, nothing to do with exports, nothing to do with imports, or whatever else our dear leader might think of to put into this legislation, which will become a treaty.
[01:40:06.024 --> 01:40:15.727]  It's really outrageous, and they're treating us like mushrooms in a cave, and I won't get into the weeds on how you feed those mushrooms, but it's not pretty.
[01:40:17.788 --> 01:40:24.429]  Well, your article at GunOwners.org breaks down the subsections of what we know.
[01:40:24.449 --> 01:40:28.351]  The UN style gun control, he says he'll do by treaty.
[01:40:28.371 --> 01:40:29.711]  I want to get an update on the UN treaty.
[01:40:31.178 --> 01:40:33.881]  Top secret TPP means you won't know what's in the bill.
[01:40:34.561 --> 01:40:36.883]  Again, the TPP is secret.
[01:40:36.903 --> 01:40:39.526]  This would just be a bill basically, I guess, authorizing it.
[01:40:39.886 --> 01:40:41.688]  Some Republicans are being duped.
[01:40:42.449 --> 01:40:43.630]  I want to talk about that.
[01:40:43.650 --> 01:40:46.593]  They're probably being duped by all the campaign donations.
[01:40:48.414 --> 01:40:49.876]  What's the strategy to beat this?
[01:40:51.503 --> 01:40:59.208]  If we don't make enough noise about this and force them to say, oh, I didn't see what was coming on this.
[01:40:59.608 --> 01:41:07.673]  Yeah, I'll vote against this or I'll at least make a motion to amend it in such a way that the president can't diddle with firearms.
[01:41:08.579 --> 01:41:09.741]  Then it's going to go right on through.
[01:41:09.761 --> 01:41:18.731]  It's going to take the kind of public outcry that forced the administration to pull back on banning certain AR-15 ammunition.
[01:41:19.532 --> 01:41:22.515]  It only is a function of heat.
[01:41:23.016 --> 01:41:25.799]  And as the old Senator Dirksen was so fond of saying,
[01:41:26.711 --> 01:41:30.612]  With his gravelly cigarette-affected voice.
[01:41:31.472 --> 01:41:34.493]  When I feel the heat, I see the light.
[01:41:36.033 --> 01:41:37.054]  Them felt the heat yet!
[01:41:37.394 --> 01:41:44.115]  So I hope your listeners are reaching for a butane torch and will use it accordingly.
[01:41:45.556 --> 01:41:47.596]  Larry, we know they're coming after our guns.
[01:41:47.636 --> 01:41:48.976]  They've stated that's the plan.
[01:41:49.036 --> 01:41:50.897]  Everywhere else in the world they've taken the guns.
[01:41:53.186 --> 01:41:55.488]  What is the constellation, the attack pattern?
[01:41:55.528 --> 01:42:01.452]  I mean, the UN treaty, this treaty, the ATF coming after the bullets.
[01:42:02.633 --> 01:42:03.714]  What's the main attack?
[01:42:03.754 --> 01:42:11.359]  Because I was talking to the professor, as I mentioned earlier, and he said he believes the biggest assault ever is about to begin.
[01:42:13.361 --> 01:42:18.805]  Well, the president gives every indication that Dr. Lott's concern is not frivolous.
[01:42:19.848 --> 01:42:26.610]  The President has said that he would use his cell phone and his pen to act when the Congress didn't act.
[01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:34.451]  Forget that little problem about the legislation in our Constitution originating with the Congress.
[01:42:35.412 --> 01:42:39.733]  But the President doesn't look at the Constitution as something to be obeyed.
[01:42:39.773 --> 01:42:42.253]  He looks at it as something to be overcome.
[01:42:43.213 --> 01:42:46.274]  And that's what he spent the last six years doing.
[01:42:47.242 --> 01:43:03.432]  And my concern is that now that he has no other elections for which he's ever going to be likely to be on the ballot, and any of the Democrats who are going to be running in 16 can plausibly say, well, the president's not going to be president anymore.
[01:43:04.110 --> 01:43:09.072]  You know, I'm my own man, and so he'll have that plausible deniability.
[01:43:09.152 --> 01:43:18.775]  His ability to damage the Democrat name will be a lot less, and my guess is that we haven't seen the full Obama yet.
[01:43:19.316 --> 01:43:22.517]  He's getting ready to do it down and dirty.
[01:43:23.932 --> 01:43:24.872]  And that's the pattern.
[01:43:24.912 --> 01:43:33.216]  I mean, we normally see when they can pardon themselves, pardon others, when they can have their party turn on them, they can take the fall and get the agenda through.
[01:43:33.236 --> 01:43:36.277]  And we've already seen a massive acceleration of tyranny.
[01:43:36.297 --> 01:43:41.819]  I mean, just opening the borders outside of law, shutting down power plants outside of law.
[01:43:43.059 --> 01:43:53.424]  Persecuting the Tea Party, not getting in trouble, and it seems to embolden this group of crooks, now that they've gotten away with so much.
[01:43:53.504 --> 01:43:57.466]  I mean, in my gut, not just intellectually, in my gut, I'm just bracing.
[01:43:58.906 --> 01:44:09.391]  There's one other suggestion that I would make, and again, it requires, in this case, backbone in the part of the Republican caucus, and that's asking for a lot, apparently.
[01:44:10.471 --> 01:44:11.832]  Because it's not just the leadership.
[01:44:12.052 --> 01:44:22.036]  The leadership is able to do what the leadership has been doing because the caucus has been willing to tolerate it, has not been willing to effectively push back.
[01:44:22.156 --> 01:44:33.080]  But the caucus could simply say on just about any spending bill, none of these funds may be used to negotiate or implement the Pacific Treaty.
[01:44:34.301 --> 01:44:37.462]  That would just put it into a screeching halt.
[01:44:38.383 --> 01:44:45.076]  Because anything that they might do would be totally unauthorized and actually they wouldn't have had the funds to do it at all.
[01:44:45.883 --> 01:44:51.389]  Of course, they really ought to be impeaching this, Jasper, but clearly they don't have the backbone for that.
[01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:56.355]  But at least cutting the funds off is an obvious solution.
[01:44:56.435 --> 01:45:01.801]  The founders gave it to us by giving it to the House of Representatives.
[01:45:02.621 --> 01:45:07.647]  They can control that purse, and if they want to close off the neck of that money bag,
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:10.624]  They can do that just that easily.
[01:45:11.425 --> 01:45:16.253]  You know, I know that Boehner is in the hip pocket of Obama and the guys play golf and party together.
[01:45:16.293 --> 01:45:17.576]  That's been on record for six years.
[01:45:18.117 --> 01:45:19.258]  But Mitch McConnell...
[01:45:20.442 --> 01:45:24.565]  What is he doing promoting the TPP and now saying nice things about Obama?
[01:45:25.386 --> 01:45:43.259]  When we just had this major political realignment, even mainline analysts said it's one of the biggest in the US history, probably the third largest in our 240 years, saying, hey, we put the Tea Party in, we put conservatives in, we put libertarians in, we want all this socialism and big government to stop, and instead it's all accelerating.
[01:45:44.471 --> 01:45:47.132]  Well, McConnell has indeed been a Republican leader.
[01:45:47.212 --> 01:45:53.253]  He's been leading Republicans into the camp of voting for various Obama initiatives.
[01:45:54.134 --> 01:46:08.458]  And this guy, the fact that he's tolerated by the Republican caucus in the Senate, suggests to me that when we have an opportunity to meet our senators, and actually our representatives too,
[01:46:10.552 --> 01:46:21.956]  Will you promise to me that you will, under no circumstances, vote for Mitch McConnell as Republican leader or Mr. Boehner as Republican leader in their respective houses?
[01:46:22.476 --> 01:46:31.739]  Because if they won't give you that flat-out commitment, it means they're wrapped around the finger of a rhino, pro-Obama leadership.
[01:46:32.099 --> 01:46:34.239]  And that's leading us into perdition.
[01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:39.461]  You're up there on Capitol Hill covering these guys, watching them.
[01:46:41.326 --> 01:46:43.067]  Why are they so spineless?
[01:46:43.107 --> 01:46:47.108]  Can't they see the trajectory of the country is going into total tyranny?
[01:46:47.128 --> 01:46:49.609]  They think they're going to be insulated from this?
[01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:53.750]  They think the Democrats are going to leave them alone once they get full power?
[01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:58.291]  Can't they smell the aggressive carcinogenic tyranny?
[01:46:58.851 --> 01:47:04.513]  Don't they understand that it's like 200 proof and that it's not going to coexist with anybody?
[01:47:05.911 --> 01:47:07.572]  I don't think they do see that.
[01:47:07.652 --> 01:47:15.395]  They think that they're going to be rewarded for having been statesmen, for having produced legislation.
[01:47:15.895 --> 01:47:24.118]  And here's one of their favorite phrases, for showing that they can govern, meaning they can reach across the aisle.
[01:47:24.578 --> 01:47:25.539]  Well, why is it
[01:47:26.511 --> 01:47:43.463]  that uh... harry reid at one time and nancy pelosi why is it that none of the democrat leaders are invited may and why isn't it insisted upon that they reach a cross the aisle why is it that the only reaching gets done from right to left
[01:47:44.519 --> 01:47:53.581]  That's because the Republicans, by and large, there are exceptions happily, but by and large, the Republicans want approval from the media.
[01:47:53.821 --> 01:48:00.262]  And they know that if they don't play ball with the Democrats, then they're going to be accused of not governing well.
[01:48:00.722 --> 01:48:04.282]  And that's the Kool-Aid that's most dangerous in this town.
[01:48:04.683 --> 01:48:08.183]  I think that's more dangerous than an outright bribe.
[01:48:08.723 --> 01:48:13.404]  It's this idea that you've got to be approved by the media or you're toast.
[01:48:13.604 --> 01:48:20.356]  And what they don't get is the only reason Rand Paul or Ted Cruz are popular and at the head of the pack is because they are seen as anti-establishment.
[01:48:20.877 --> 01:48:24.724]  Going along, especially the way things are now, only...
[01:48:25.876 --> 01:48:30.321]  Only waters down the message, and then you don't stand out with bright colors.
[01:48:31.002 --> 01:48:32.664]  As the cliche goes, shifting gears.
[01:48:32.684 --> 01:48:36.929]  I want to come back and finish up with their attacks on the Second Amendment, the UN Treaty, and more with Larry Pratt.
[01:48:37.229 --> 01:48:38.411]  GunOwners.org.
[01:48:38.431 --> 01:48:41.134]  Go there, sign up for their free updates, or become a member.
[01:48:41.314 --> 01:48:44.298]  If you join any organization, you should join GunOwners.org.
[01:48:45.499 --> 01:48:48.621]  You can give him a call as well there off the website.
[01:48:48.641 --> 01:48:53.244]  He'll give you the number when we come back to become a yearly member or a lifetime member.
[01:48:53.544 --> 01:48:58.367]  And if you don't, shame on you because we would not even have the Second Amendment right now, I can tell you.
[01:48:58.667 --> 01:49:02.650]  Or we'd be in a civil war if it wasn't for the work of gun owners of America.
[01:49:02.830 --> 01:49:03.790]  That's not an overstatement.
[01:49:04.130 --> 01:49:04.871]  It's an understatement.
[01:49:05.671 --> 01:49:06.132]  Jade Helm.
[01:49:06.897 --> 01:49:11.102]  We've got Senator Cruz coming out saying the government's lost the trust under Obama.
[01:49:11.142 --> 01:49:12.404]  That's why Texans are concerned.
[01:49:13.065 --> 01:49:14.367]  Louie Gohmert was in the military.
[01:49:14.647 --> 01:49:17.571]  He says, why is Texas and Utah listed hostile in Orange County?
[01:49:18.512 --> 01:49:22.136]  We've got all these other, the governor coming out, Abbott.
[01:49:22.717 --> 01:49:26.419]  We're not saying the military is going to capture Texas and take the guns this summer.
[01:49:26.699 --> 01:49:27.540]  We never said that.
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:29.701]  They say that to claim we're deranged.
[01:49:29.981 --> 01:49:34.364]  What we said was, this is another drill that looks like it's for domestic operations.
[01:49:34.864 --> 01:49:38.727]  We've got all these videos coming in of the military trying to take on Tea Party and gun owners.
[01:49:39.567 --> 01:49:42.929]  The police getting the MRAPs, saying it's for the Second Amendment.
[01:49:43.229 --> 01:49:44.150]  It's for the veterans.
[01:49:45.151 --> 01:49:50.454]  And it looks like the Republicans, a lot of them, actually get this and aren't backing down from the media, ridiculing them.
[01:49:50.814 --> 01:49:51.915]  Chuck Norris has come out.
[01:49:52.768 --> 01:49:55.631]  Instead he trusts the military, but not those pulling the strings.
[01:49:56.151 --> 01:49:57.252]  I think this is healthy.
[01:49:57.552 --> 01:50:01.136]  Chuck Norris quoted Benjamin Franklin in his column at WND.com.
[01:50:01.436 --> 01:50:04.098]  Distrust and caution are the parents of security.
[01:50:04.839 --> 01:50:05.640]  Benjamin Franklin.
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:08.803]  And we're going to skip this network break so we have more time on Larry Pratt.
[01:50:09.203 --> 01:50:10.744]  Larry, what do you make of...
[01:50:11.525 --> 01:50:29.169]  The overall militarization of police, the overall federalization, the TSA, when the feds themselves are basically more and more following UN scripts, I think it's healthy that... I mean, we heard Al Sharpton say, use the riots to federalize police.
[01:50:29.909 --> 01:50:32.810]  I mean, this is a federalization happening and I think it's very healthy.
[01:50:33.890 --> 01:50:40.474]  That a lot of the real libertarian conservative constitutionalist leaders are not throwing info wars under the bus.
[01:50:40.894 --> 01:50:42.955]  They're saying, no, it's reasonable to question this.
[01:50:43.716 --> 01:50:55.042]  If Operation Jade Helm were being conducted under a President Paul or President Cruz or President Walker, three of the conservative frontrunners, I guess we could say,
[01:50:56.171 --> 01:51:04.738]  We might be watching to see what's happening, but we wouldn't have the same inability to accept what the administration is saying.
[01:51:05.178 --> 01:51:09.381]  This administration has not earned our trust.
[01:51:09.722 --> 01:51:11.963]  They have lied repeatedly.
[01:51:12.344 --> 01:51:16.927]  So even if what they're saying happens to be true, who's to know?
[01:51:16.947 --> 01:51:20.610]  I mean, when have they told the truth?
[01:51:22.757 --> 01:51:33.202]  So, God bless Governor Abbott, who said, okay, we'll take at your word, but don't mind if I have the National Guard keeping an eye on you, reporting to me.
[01:51:34.122 --> 01:51:34.803]  Good for him!
[01:51:34.983 --> 01:51:41.226]  Well, you're supposed to have the governor over the guard, and the feds have tried to take that over and make it ceremonial now.
[01:51:41.946 --> 01:51:45.968]  To me, this is just the states and the people flexing their muscles.
[01:51:46.747 --> 01:51:46.947]  Yeah.
[01:51:47.448 --> 01:51:51.852]  It's long overdue, but I'm glad it's happening now better than never.
[01:51:52.593 --> 01:51:56.977]  And kudos to those who are questioning.
[01:51:57.077 --> 01:52:04.664]  And I don't know that any of these public officials have actually made any accusations that this is a nefarious plot.
[01:52:05.145 --> 01:52:08.929]  All they're saying is, hey, let's have a little bit of openness, Mr. President.
[01:52:09.009 --> 01:52:10.030]  Transparency.
[01:52:11.468 --> 01:52:12.329]  Well, that's what it is.
[01:52:12.449 --> 01:52:14.992]  I mean, the president is acting as a dictator more and more.
[01:52:15.092 --> 01:52:16.193]  Congress is letting him do it.
[01:52:16.853 --> 01:52:19.476]  And I think it might be too little too late.
[01:52:19.516 --> 01:52:21.318]  I mean, who knows what power grab he may pull.
[01:52:21.698 --> 01:52:24.401]  This shows a little bit of that old American instinct.
[01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:28.261]  Like Ronald Reagan said, to trust but verify.
[01:52:28.941 --> 01:52:40.166]  And I mean, look, everybody knows, from Forbes to the Associated Press to Nightline, that they're training the military to take on vets and gun owners and saying we're the threat, not Al-Qaeda or ISIS.
[01:52:40.706 --> 01:52:42.647]  Everybody knows that, and guess why we know?
[01:52:43.768 --> 01:52:46.149]  They're busy claiming we don't like the military.
[01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:49.110]  It's the military that's telling us they're being given these missions.
[01:52:49.210 --> 01:52:49.990]  They don't like it.
[01:52:50.971 --> 01:52:54.132]  The military, still, from everything I can pick up,
[01:52:54.725 --> 01:52:58.386]  is substantially supportive of the Constitution.
[01:52:58.726 --> 01:53:10.408]  They respect the fact that they took an oath to uphold the Constitution, not to support Mein Führer, which they did in Nazi Germany, which they've done in totalitarian countries around the world.
[01:53:11.368 --> 01:53:15.389]  The oath is to a person rather than to a Constitution.
[01:53:16.029 --> 01:53:20.130]  And we still have substantially, I think, police and military
[01:53:20.543 --> 01:53:23.566]  that take that seriously, and that's a saving grace.
[01:53:24.206 --> 01:53:25.828]  Obama's been very frustrated.
[01:53:25.888 --> 01:53:29.171]  We know that he's been cutting out leaders from the military.
[01:53:29.731 --> 01:53:39.881]  Actually, in one case, I read of a battlefield officer who was cashiered on the spot in Afghanistan, in the middle of a battle.
[01:53:39.921 --> 01:53:41.322]  He's told, you're out of here, bud.
[01:53:42.303 --> 01:53:45.366]  So that's what our dear leader is doing to try to neuter
[01:53:46.275 --> 01:53:50.621]  Uh, those constitutionally loyal officers in the military.
[01:53:50.661 --> 01:53:53.986]  But I think he's going to have a lot more neutering to do, hopefully.
[01:53:54.006 --> 01:53:55.227]  Well, that's right.
[01:53:55.267 --> 01:54:00.174]  There's a battle for the heart and the soul of our republic, and at the heart of it's our military and our police.
[01:54:01.015 --> 01:54:02.995]  And the police have been given a lot of bad training.
[01:54:03.035 --> 01:54:04.896]  There are some bad cops, some bad departments.
[01:54:05.216 --> 01:54:14.718]  But overall, George Soros is funding this anti-cop movement to try to make social change and have an Arab, you know, commie spring, whatever you want to call it.
[01:54:14.738 --> 01:54:18.198]  I mean, Al Gore said we need an Arab spring here in America three years ago.
[01:54:18.558 --> 01:54:19.958]  George Soros is funding it.
[01:54:20.779 --> 01:54:25.880]  But it's a socialist spring to make reform about shooting cops in the head.
[01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:27.700]  No, that's not what reform is.
[01:54:28.422 --> 01:54:30.062]  No, it's certainly not.
[01:54:30.203 --> 01:54:38.745]  And, you know, just before we run out of time, I just want to celebrate the unnamed officer in Garland, Texas.
[01:54:39.225 --> 01:54:45.307]  Here's a guy faced with a couple of Muslim terrorists under fire from guys with rifles.
[01:54:46.027 --> 01:54:49.868]  And it's got to be his off-duty weapon, because it's a Glock 45.
[01:54:49.908 --> 01:54:50.668]  I'm not aware that
[01:54:51.241 --> 01:55:16.628]  uh... that's a police firearm uh... in many departments anyway so he pulls out his pistol he obviously is able to perceive that hitting center of mass doesn't do anything because the the terrorists are wearing body armor so this guy is able to pop them in the head and stop them before they're able to kill anybody amazing only in america if that had been in france
[01:55:18.064 --> 01:55:21.107]  There's been a five-day manhunt, martial law.
[01:55:21.688 --> 01:55:23.069]  We never would have heard the end of it.
[01:55:23.610 --> 01:55:23.810]  Right.
[01:55:25.131 --> 01:55:26.572]  What do you think of the anti-gunners?
[01:55:26.612 --> 01:55:29.936]  And just to be clear, what I meant, Arab Spring as I'm in, he wanted something like that here.
[01:55:29.956 --> 01:55:32.518]  He said a liberal spring, a black spring.
[01:55:32.778 --> 01:55:36.282]  The point is they want to get a classic communist civil war going.
[01:55:36.902 --> 01:55:42.388]  What they don't understand is that a lot of the motivation for that spring, say in Egypt,
[01:55:42.888 --> 01:55:46.291]  was against Morsi, the Muslim dictator.
[01:55:46.771 --> 01:55:53.416]  And things quieted down when the pro-American military took over and put Morsi and his pal in jails.
[01:55:53.936 --> 01:55:57.519]  So, these guys can't even read what's happening abroad correctly.
[01:55:57.899 --> 01:56:06.105]  They hope they can somehow ignite a Muslim flame to burn up the world, and our dear leader has been doing what he can
[01:56:08.006 --> 01:56:24.572]  But they did stop the blowing up of the churches and crucifying Christians upside down and letting people live in peace and letting tourists come to the country.
[01:56:25.072 --> 01:56:27.573]  It's a whole lot better with them than without them.
[01:56:29.468 --> 01:56:33.651]  Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America is here.
[01:56:33.851 --> 01:56:35.252]  How do people become members?
[01:56:35.292 --> 01:56:40.736]  How do people support the literal tip of the spear in the defense of human right to self-defense?
[01:56:41.396 --> 01:56:55.606]  You can find us at gunowners.org and even if you're not ready to join with a contribution today, do get on the email alert list because that's how we have stopped anti-gun legislation even when our friends at the NRA were supporting it.
[01:56:56.087 --> 01:56:58.128]  So it's a lot of action there.
[01:56:58.248 --> 01:56:59.269]  It's free and it
[01:56:59.650 --> 01:57:12.363]  It's very easy to use, and we would just urge strongly that hopefully most people can get on the internet, go to gunhunters.org, go to that take action area on the site, and begin getting those alerts.
[01:57:12.403 --> 01:57:12.683]  That's right.
[01:57:12.703 --> 01:57:18.589]  Because you'll find out what's going on, and we'll make it possible to do something effective about it.
[01:57:18.989 --> 01:57:21.472]  Well, I've got a fighting spirit, you've got a fighting spirit.
[01:57:21.992 --> 01:57:23.773]  And I'm just sick of people thinking we're doomed.
[01:57:23.893 --> 01:57:25.314]  Every time we take action, we win.
[01:57:25.815 --> 01:57:30.998]  The problem is enough people aren't doing it, so everybody needs to go there and become a year member, a lifetime member.
[01:57:31.019 --> 01:57:32.279]  They need to sign up for the alerts.
[01:57:32.299 --> 01:57:37.783]  They need to put them on Facebook and Twitter and get them out to people, because we're going to start turning the tide against this tyranny.
[01:57:38.324 --> 01:57:40.765]  Professor Lott, Dr. Lott, thinks that's happening as well.
[01:57:41.746 --> 01:57:43.808]  The alternative is total enslavement.
[01:57:44.448 --> 01:57:46.790]  Larry Pratt of Governors of America, thank you so much for the time.
[01:57:47.501 --> 01:57:49.903]  Alex, thanks so much for letting me in front of your microphone.
[01:57:50.203 --> 01:57:51.324]  Oh, you're awesome, sir.
[01:57:51.344 --> 01:57:51.924]  Thank you for the time.
[01:57:52.364 --> 01:57:54.246]  There goes Larry Pratt, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:54.266 --> 01:57:55.466]  Gunowners.org.
[01:57:55.907 --> 01:58:02.271]  He's such a good, you know, southern gentleman that he won't even ask you to donate.
[01:58:02.631 --> 01:58:04.252]  He's like, oh, no need to donate.
[01:58:04.393 --> 01:58:05.253]  Just get the alerts.
[01:58:05.653 --> 01:58:06.834]  You need to support them.
[01:58:06.854 --> 01:58:07.575]  You need to support us.
[01:58:08.966 --> 01:58:13.731]  It's a donation to the truth and what we're doing and also to your hide and our hide.
[01:58:13.772 --> 01:58:14.472]  We're all in this together.
[01:58:14.813 --> 01:58:15.834]  Hang together, hang separate.
[01:58:15.854 --> 01:58:16.434]  Benjamin Franklin.

[01:58:42.537 --> 01:58:46.479]  And then we're a platform for all the other Liberty Bay systems.
[01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:48.541]  InfoWars is like a big mothership now.
[01:58:48.941 --> 01:58:54.785]  I don't like that because we're a major target, but let's just admit it, Star Wars analogy, we're like the executor for the good guys.
[01:58:59.449 --> 01:59:03.414]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:59:03.434 --> 01:59:06.998]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:59:07.258 --> 01:59:10.102]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:59:10.282 --> 01:59:17.511]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:59:17.711 --> 01:59:21.293]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:59:21.553 --> 01:59:25.776]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:59:25.916 --> 01:59:31.779]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:59:31.839 --> 01:59:35.582]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:59:35.702 --> 01:59:38.223]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:59:38.403 --> 01:59:39.764]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:59:39.904 --> 01:59:41.105]  It's time to take action.
[01:59:41.245 --> 01:59:42.866]  It's time to filter our water.
[01:59:43.186 --> 01:59:51.413]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and for a limited time use the promo code WATER20 and get 20% off all Pro-Pure products.
[01:59:51.593 --> 01:59:55.736]  Again, that's InfoWarsStore.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[01:59:55.817 --> 01:59:57.258]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:13.993 --> 02:00:14.633]  Big Brother.
[02:00:15.294 --> 02:00:16.335]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:17.075 --> 02:00:18.176]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:18.836 --> 02:00:19.637]  You want answers?
[02:00:20.417 --> 02:00:21.318]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:21.958 --> 02:00:25.621]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.161 --> 02:00:30.204]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.304 --> 02:00:39.672]  We're lined up on globalist targets.
[02:00:39.712 --> 02:00:42.354]  We're firing on all cylinders, thanks to the good Lord above.
[02:00:43.115 --> 02:00:45.317]  It is the Friday Worldwide Global Transmission.
[02:00:47.418 --> 02:00:49.420]  Man, there is a lot of news on the economy.
[02:00:52.463 --> 02:00:56.807]  The Torik party stayed in power and expanded.
[02:00:57.984 --> 02:01:03.207]  Giving David Cameron five more years because they pose as UKIP, the Libertarian Party.
[02:01:05.608 --> 02:01:09.210]  But that party did gain some more seats, so positive news on that front.
[02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:18.095]  People were so scared of the Communists, just like they were in Scotland, that they voted for basically the very same group under a different name.
[02:01:19.316 --> 02:01:26.540]  But we'll see now if David Cameron does what he's sworn he's going to do and give the UK a vote on being in the Europe.
[02:01:27.677 --> 02:01:39.344]  Now, polls are like 85% against being in it, so that's why they haven't let them have a vote, but if they have a vote in the next few years, you can bet your bottom dollar that it's going to be a fraud, because the EU is a dictatorial body.
[02:01:39.805 --> 02:01:41.245]  They're all about not giving you a vote.
[02:01:43.007 --> 02:01:44.507]  I wanted to show this to folks.
[02:01:45.308 --> 02:01:46.469]  It's an amazing image.
[02:01:46.529 --> 02:01:48.570]  If you're a radio listener, go to Infowars.com.
[02:01:48.590 --> 02:01:49.451]  It's the one in Telegraph.
[02:01:50.011 --> 02:01:54.714]  X-ray scan reveals boy in suitcase being smuggled into Spain.
[02:01:55.973 --> 02:02:05.237]  Eight-year-old boy being smuggled to Spain in a suitcase caught by police using x-ray scanning on bags crossing border into the CETU, how do you say that?
[02:02:05.317 --> 02:02:08.078]  C-E-U-T-A enclave from Morocco.
[02:02:08.098 --> 02:02:10.359]  How do you pronounce that in Spanish?
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:12.080]  CETU?
[02:02:14.081 --> 02:02:16.822]  Police found an eight-year-old boy
[02:02:18.308 --> 02:02:29.037]  Hidden in a suitcase that was smuggled across the border from North Africa, the 19-year-old woman took the case through a pedestrian crossing from Morocco into a small Spanish governed territory.
[02:02:29.557 --> 02:02:38.365]  On Thursday, a spokesman for the Civil Guard Police Force said, when they put the suitcase through the scanner, the operator noticed something strange, which seemed to be a person inside the case.
[02:02:39.286 --> 02:02:41.708]  Can you imagine the claustrophobia of that?
[02:02:42.930 --> 02:02:44.811]  Can you imagine that?
[02:02:45.471 --> 02:02:50.032]  I mean, I'm not really claustrophobic, but I don't like really small enclosed spaces.
[02:02:52.133 --> 02:02:54.594]  And then they've got photos of him emerging from the bag.
[02:02:54.634 --> 02:02:56.154]  I mean, good Lord.
[02:02:57.514 --> 02:03:00.155]  The boy said he was eight years old from the Ivory Coast, according to spokesman.
[02:03:00.495 --> 02:03:03.096]  The civil guard arrested the woman who was due to go before a judge.
[02:03:03.496 --> 02:03:07.298]  They also arrested the boy's father, who he tried to cross the border a few months later.
[02:03:07.718 --> 02:03:11.839]  The father is from the Ivory Coast and lives in Spain's Canary Islands.
[02:03:13.396 --> 02:03:18.359]  Thousands of migrants each year risk their lives, a lot more than that, trying to get into Spain.
[02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:21.401]  Yeah, you ever heard how Spain got conquered from North Africa?
[02:03:21.421 --> 02:03:24.803]  Yeah, I was reading Spanish history again last night.
[02:03:25.023 --> 02:03:26.304]  It's just so fascinating.
[02:03:26.784 --> 02:03:27.845]  I want to go to Spain someday.
[02:03:27.885 --> 02:03:33.349]  I've been to other areas of Europe and stuff, but I really want to go to Spain because, you know, Spain was Germanic.
[02:03:34.529 --> 02:03:35.990]  Spain really wasn't even populated.
[02:03:36.791 --> 02:03:41.394]  And then it was conquered by Germanic tribes and then by the Romans.
[02:03:42.796 --> 02:03:45.938]  But it really wasn't Congress, it was sparsely populated.
[02:03:47.158 --> 02:03:51.120]  And then it got invaded by the Moors, basically Arabs.
[02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:53.761]  Just a very interesting culture.
[02:03:54.442 --> 02:03:59.504]  And then that culture founds the new culture with the Mesoamerican culture in the United States.
[02:03:59.524 --> 02:04:03.245]  Just very interesting to watch how all that stuff mixes together.
[02:04:03.946 --> 02:04:08.248]  But that's why I was sitting there one time
[02:04:10.250 --> 02:04:11.030]  With some friends.
[02:04:13.652 --> 02:04:18.214]  When it first came out, like 15 years ago, 20 years ago, whatever it was, we were watching Spartacus.
[02:04:18.274 --> 02:04:18.975]  I mean, not Spartacus.
[02:04:18.995 --> 02:04:20.536]  That's another good movie based on a real story.
[02:04:20.736 --> 02:04:21.796]  Stanley Kubrick directed that.
[02:04:21.816 --> 02:04:23.738]  They ought to remake that.
[02:04:23.758 --> 02:04:26.259]  I don't think that's one of his better films.
[02:04:26.279 --> 02:04:29.141]  Still, it's a good film, but it was more like a big Hollywood blockbuster he made.
[02:04:29.601 --> 02:04:31.542]  But I was watching Gladiator.
[02:04:32.803 --> 02:04:34.644]  And I was sitting there, and
[02:04:36.206 --> 02:04:39.167]  Well, my friends goes, that guy doesn't look like he's Spanish from Spain.
[02:04:39.187 --> 02:04:41.929]  And I was just like, how ignorant are you?
[02:04:41.949 --> 02:04:45.831]  I go, that's exactly what somebody from Spain 2000 years ago look like.
[02:04:46.211 --> 02:04:48.532]  It's just very interesting to how all this stuff works.
[02:04:49.052 --> 02:04:51.353]  All right, we'll be right back on the other side.
[02:04:51.373 --> 02:04:52.654]  We're going to look at
[02:04:53.674 --> 02:04:58.317]  Something that really is bad that the police are doing, and it's killing people's dogs.
[02:04:58.957 --> 02:05:03.900]  In fact, will you guys pull up the article I saw last week where the cop, the video, shoots the dog over the fence for no reason?
[02:05:04.661 --> 02:05:05.821]  Just barking at him, they shoot him.
[02:05:06.362 --> 02:05:08.363]  But then if you hurt a police dog, you're going under the jail.
[02:05:09.935 --> 02:05:10.615]  Texas Rep.
[02:05:10.795 --> 02:05:17.977]  Louie Gohmert is joining a long list of congressmen who are actually doing their job and addressing the concerns of their citizens.
[02:05:18.237 --> 02:05:23.499]  Gohmert says he understands the concerns Texans have about the upcoming Jade Helm exercise.
[02:05:23.799 --> 02:05:30.181]  The congressman took particular issue with the map's labeling of Republican-majority states as hostile.
[02:05:30.641 --> 02:05:38.663]  Gohmert called on the Pentagon to change the map, the names on the map, and said the tone of the exercise needs to be completely revamped.
[02:05:38.923 --> 02:05:43.967]  So the federal government is not intentionally practicing war against its own states.
[02:05:44.548 --> 02:05:50.252]  Former Texas governor and potential presidential candidate Rick Perry has some different thoughts though.
[02:05:50.712 --> 02:05:55.636]  Perry said, it's okay to question your government, but the military is something else.

[02:07:09.062 --> 02:07:10.303]  I want more candy!
[02:07:10.323 --> 02:07:11.344]  I want more video games!
[02:07:11.364 --> 02:07:11.844]  Mine!
[02:07:12.084 --> 02:07:12.204]  Mine!
[02:07:12.224 --> 02:07:12.324]  Mine!
[02:07:38.882 --> 02:07:39.662]  I think so.
[02:08:25.442 --> 02:08:27.082]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:27.542 --> 02:08:40.025]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:40.065 --> 02:08:43.986]  Michael Ozias, filmmaker, is going to be our guest here to the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:44.666 --> 02:08:51.167]  Then we're going to have a detailed presentation on deeper research into Jade Helm.
[02:08:52.509 --> 02:08:55.912]  And what the Pentagon and the military are being directed to do.
[02:08:58.374 --> 02:09:02.718]  And it deals with total domination of the human domain.
[02:09:02.818 --> 02:09:03.438]  That's a quote.
[02:09:04.299 --> 02:09:07.902]  With everything you do in an algorithm tracking you and your family.
[02:09:09.423 --> 02:09:11.445]  Listing veterans, again, as the number one enemy.
[02:09:11.745 --> 02:09:18.711]  We already know that, but it's just so outrageous and generals sitting around on C-SPAN talking about it.
[02:09:20.984 --> 02:09:22.625]  It's a bold criminal takeover.
[02:09:23.785 --> 02:09:31.207]  And to do that, they have to get the police federalized, paramilitarized to a certain extent.
[02:09:31.247 --> 02:09:37.569]  Then the cops act bad, then the feds come in as the saviors and fully federalize them as Al Sharpton said two days ago they plan to do.
[02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:39.970]  Or I guess three days ago, that was on Tuesday.
[02:09:43.499 --> 02:09:50.603]  This is a phenomenon I've been covering for really 20 years on air because it would happen locally and people would call me on my radio show or TV show and want me to cover it.
[02:09:53.244 --> 02:09:57.486]  And I'd go out to the house and they'd go, yeah, the Labrador was chained.
[02:09:57.706 --> 02:09:58.507]  Here's the photos.
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:01.140]  And the cops came to serve a search warrant.
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:06.702]  His neighbor said they smelled marijuana, and they did find a, you know, dime bag or something at one house, not at another.
[02:10:06.722 --> 02:10:10.002]  There was a couple of these cases with labs, and they would just shoot him.
[02:10:10.522 --> 02:10:13.403]  Because the dog's barking, and that doesn't let us control the situation.
[02:10:14.603 --> 02:10:16.784]  And I've seen Chihuahuas, Palmeranians.
[02:10:17.644 --> 02:10:21.185]  I mean, you come in a house, the dog's jumping up and down, it wants to protect it.
[02:10:21.525 --> 02:10:25.886]  But then you see stories where some guy kicks a police dog and gets 50 years in prison.
[02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:40.165]  Or a thing I saw out of Pennsylvania years ago in the Associated Press, where the guy's in a Walmart parking lot, the window's open, the German Shepherd goes, rawr, and almost bites him, because the guy parked by a police car, and the guy yelled at the dog and got indicted for assault.
[02:10:40.305 --> 02:10:45.147]  So, their dogs are better than people, but then our dogs have no rights.
[02:10:47.748 --> 02:10:55.931]  And Michael Oseas has made the film of dogsandmen.net, of dogsandmen.net, and they're giving us an exclusive.
[02:10:57.222 --> 02:11:01.323]  First sneak peek, a special trailer, just for InfoWars.com viewers.
[02:11:01.904 --> 02:11:03.484]  And again, we're mainly a radio show.
[02:11:04.685 --> 02:11:14.848]  Over 170 affiliates, most people are listening on AM and FM, but I got so sick of the media more than 14, 15 years ago, saying I was making stuff up, so we have a TV as well.
[02:11:15.108 --> 02:11:16.509]  Now it's a full production shoot.
[02:11:17.269 --> 02:11:22.931]  It's nice in the studios, you'll see it, you know, any major city affiliate, not as nice as like a Fox or CNN.
[02:11:24.011 --> 02:11:28.314]  I don't have the money, but the point is it's there to professionally show you all this.
[02:11:28.874 --> 02:11:32.556]  So there's that added layer to it, that added dimension.
[02:11:32.937 --> 02:11:40.721]  And if you're a radio listener, you can always go to Infowars.com forward slash show and find the free feed, the video feed, the free podcast, droid apps, everything.
[02:11:41.322 --> 02:11:47.406]  And most importantly, pass that link on to people and tell folks about the local AM and FM affiliate as well.
[02:11:47.866 --> 02:11:52.609]  Don't take this stuff for granted.
[02:11:53.743 --> 02:11:54.523]  Don't do it.
[02:11:55.104 --> 02:12:06.110]  Realize that the system is basically doing everything it can to ensure that you don't get access to mind-blowing info.
[02:12:06.130 --> 02:12:12.994]  Because it's not from a leftist perspective, not from a right-wing perspective, it's from a constitutional, pro-human, pro-liberty perspective.
[02:12:14.431 --> 02:12:15.892]  People ask, why are you against GMO?
[02:12:15.932 --> 02:12:17.873]  You're a libertarian, or a conservative.
[02:12:18.474 --> 02:12:24.398]  I'm a libertarian conservative on a lot of issues, but the liberals at grassroots know that GMO is bad.
[02:12:24.798 --> 02:12:27.220]  They're the ones that are against vaccines more than conservatives.
[02:12:28.381 --> 02:12:31.583]  Those are real liberals, not the fake fascists like Obama.
[02:12:33.945 --> 02:12:36.887]  So, these labels don't mean anything at the end of the day.
[02:12:38.834 --> 02:12:43.557]  We talk about liberals, because new listeners that tune in every millisecond, they know what I mean when I say that.
[02:12:44.277 --> 02:12:50.921]  Let's go ahead and play this first sneak peek for Of Dogs and Men at ofdogsandmen.net.
[02:12:51.201 --> 02:12:53.523]  We're going to tweet this out as well at Real Alex Jones.
[02:12:53.743 --> 02:12:54.043]  Here it is.
[02:12:54.063 --> 02:12:57.985]  Chloe enjoyed apples.
[02:12:58.105 --> 02:13:01.627]  If I took two slices, she'd just kind of give me a look like, hey, that one was mine.
[02:13:05.003 --> 02:13:07.064]  Ava was like my fourth daughter.
[02:13:07.325 --> 02:13:10.467]  A very, very sweet, gentle dog.
[02:13:10.527 --> 02:13:15.690]  Which one is it?
[02:13:15.850 --> 02:13:17.492]  I got an A, B, and C.
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:32.981]  He pulled out his gun and shot her right in the head.
[02:13:33.021 --> 02:13:34.762]  I said, you shot my dog, you shot my dog.
[02:13:34.802 --> 02:13:37.543]  They hunted him down from behind and killed him.
[02:13:37.603 --> 02:13:39.104]  Please don't let my baby die.
[02:13:41.585 --> 02:13:46.188]  This situation made a lot of people feel like it could have been them.
[02:13:48.008 --> 02:13:50.590]  A police officer shot and killed a woman yesterday.
[02:13:50.610 --> 02:13:53.291]  He did not mean to shoot the lady, he was aiming for the dog.
[02:13:53.551 --> 02:13:55.072]  Don't shoot my dog!
[02:13:55.092 --> 02:13:58.634]  The same police officer that killed him said he wasn't nothing but a dog!
[02:14:02.742 --> 02:14:03.763]  He ain't gonna do nothing.
[02:14:03.783 --> 02:14:04.884]  He ain't gonna do nothing.
[02:14:05.005 --> 02:14:12.152]  Everybody needs to remember, there are two sides to every story.
[02:14:12.353 --> 02:14:17.799]  Police department, is anybody home?
[02:14:17.859 --> 02:14:20.622]  We gotta think about life, death, family.
[02:14:20.702 --> 02:14:21.363]  Step back.
[02:14:24.122 --> 02:14:26.503]  I've fired one shot into the dog's head.
[02:14:26.823 --> 02:14:29.783]  Drug dealers have aggressive dogs.
[02:14:29.903 --> 02:14:33.204]  Have you ever seen a drug dealer using a Labrador dog?
[02:14:35.964 --> 02:14:36.184]  No.
[02:14:38.565 --> 02:14:41.786]  A police officer had shot and killed their dog.
[02:14:42.206 --> 02:14:45.766]  And that dog was a Chihuahua.
[02:14:45.806 --> 02:14:50.868]  The knee-jerk reaction is to circle the wagons, prepare for a fight, and deny everything.
[02:14:51.268 --> 02:14:52.888]  We have the witness that doesn't lie.
[02:14:54.232 --> 02:14:57.153]  We have the video tape.
[02:14:57.453 --> 02:15:17.980]  Why is it so commonly justified that we literally shoot five, six, seven bullets at a threat that has never killed one of us in a line of duty?
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:20.641]  Of dogs and men, of dogsandmen.net,
[02:15:23.618 --> 02:15:25.720]  I appreciate our guests joining us.
[02:15:28.322 --> 02:15:32.966]  Michael Ozeas started making films on Super 8 camera when he was 7 years old.
[02:15:32.986 --> 02:15:36.889]  He's always known it was his career ambition to attend film school for moving to Los Angeles.
[02:15:36.929 --> 02:15:42.954]  Initially, he worked as an editor for movies and television shows like American Idol and Dr. Phil and Son of a Guns.
[02:15:43.434 --> 02:15:44.695]  He then co-founded
[02:15:46.072 --> 02:15:53.555]  His new media company where he has written and directed web videos on socially relevant topics like the drug war, the legal system, and education.
[02:15:53.575 --> 02:15:55.996]  He holds a BA in film production from the University of Central Florida.
[02:15:56.656 --> 02:15:58.537]  Michael, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:15:59.877 --> 02:16:04.439]  Wow, to watch him shoot the chihuahuas on that video, it's crazy.
[02:16:04.459 --> 02:16:10.381]  And I see those articles all the time where the Pomeranian was shot three times, the Dachshund was shot four times.
[02:16:11.181 --> 02:16:17.769]  And, I mean, that's the reason you don't do no-knock raids and stuff, unless it really is terrorists or a giant drug lab.
[02:16:18.089 --> 02:16:25.818]  But now they're doing this across the board, and I just saw in the news last week where the cop, have you seen the video, where he shoots the dog over the fence because it's barking at him?
[02:16:26.499 --> 02:16:29.503]  I mean, this is just crazy, just from a PR perspective.
[02:16:30.516 --> 02:16:36.000]  I mean, I'd get it if I was doing a warrant service on a child molester and a pit bull rushed me, I'd shoot it.
[02:16:36.500 --> 02:16:37.981]  And nobody's going to say you shouldn't.
[02:16:38.522 --> 02:16:46.267]  But the videos of, like, the lab on a leash backing away while it's being shot, I mean, it's just crazy town.
[02:16:47.128 --> 02:16:51.631]  I mean, I went to one house where, and you can see where the dog had slumped, the dog never even got up.
[02:16:52.111 --> 02:16:55.814]  They came in, the lab started to get up, they shot it a couple times.
[02:16:58.616 --> 02:17:00.077]  I mean, why is this happening?
[02:17:00.137 --> 02:17:02.599]  Is it increasing, or are we just aware of it now?
[02:17:02.659 --> 02:17:03.559]  What's going on, Michael?
[02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:13.666]  Well, first of all, thank you for having me on, Alex, and playing the trailer, and I appreciate you consistently talking about these incidents when they come up.
[02:17:14.547 --> 02:17:15.687]  People need to know about it.
[02:17:15.747 --> 02:17:18.029]  There's a lot of people who just don't know that it's going on.
[02:17:18.049 --> 02:17:23.493]  I think that's the number one obstacle facing change right now, so we're working on that.
[02:17:24.133 --> 02:17:26.554]  But, yeah, is it increasing?
[02:17:27.295 --> 02:17:37.140]  We believe that it is increasing, and the reason that we think so is because it really only takes a quick peek at a couple of trends, and those would be really cultural trends.
[02:17:37.180 --> 02:17:43.984]  You notice, like, in the 70s, there maybe was a couple hundred SWAT raids a year, using SWAT as an example.
[02:17:44.024 --> 02:17:46.705]  We know that's where this whole thing started to become an issue.
[02:17:46.725 --> 02:17:47.246]  Daryl Yates!
[02:17:48.446 --> 02:17:56.630]  And then as recently as 2005, we're at north of 50,000 of these raids annually.
[02:17:56.670 --> 02:18:08.736]  So if you take that and you put it together with the cultural change that we as dog owners have also experienced where the dog used to be guarding the farm and then it was in the backyard, now it's in our house.
[02:18:09.416 --> 02:18:16.900]  And so you have these two factions basically both kind of meeting in the middle here inside our homes.
[02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:20.142]  With tragic results.
[02:18:20.343 --> 02:18:38.620]  We have paramilitary forces coming in our houses, looking for drugs the government shipped in, the banks laundered, and then our Chihuahua or our Dachshund gets up and they just, and I get it, they want to control the situation, they want to watch for humans, they want to see what's happening, so they just dispatch the dog as a matter of course, and then lie about it.
[02:18:40.472 --> 02:18:43.013]  Well, it's become very routine.
[02:18:43.433 --> 02:18:55.837]  And while there may be some departments out there that have a full-time staff of SWAT officers, largely, a lot of these SWAT officers, they do other things.
[02:18:55.997 --> 02:18:59.499]  And so they're, you know, they're working in the prisons or they're regular beat cops or something.
[02:18:59.539 --> 02:19:01.539]  And then when there's a raid, they suit up and they go do it.
[02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:08.382]  And so in the 80s, when shooting the dog was as part of training,
[02:19:09.182 --> 02:19:12.943]  Known to be an acceptable means of handling that solution.
[02:19:13.023 --> 02:19:21.925]  It started to happen with more and more regularity and then it spilled over as those same officers were not in a SWAT situation.
[02:19:21.945 --> 02:19:27.587]  Yeah, because all the dog knows from all its instincts is the cave is being invaded by another tribe of people.
[02:19:27.707 --> 02:19:28.367]  I'm gonna bark.
[02:19:28.807 --> 02:19:30.328]  And so they're executed for barking.
[02:19:30.348 --> 02:19:31.048]  That's what's going on.
[02:19:32.219 --> 02:19:52.543]  Yeah, I think like if you charge through a door wearing all dark clothes and your face covered with a shield and shouting very loudly, you'd really need a sack of cats to be any more assaulting on the sensitive... Well, I mean, even a lab is gonna bark when the family it loves is being... I mean, it's just all a big joke.
[02:19:52.883 --> 02:19:59.225]  Then they ship the drugs in so they can destabilize everything and bring us to this point, like a civil war, like Mexico.
[02:19:59.685 --> 02:20:00.965]  Stay there, we've got the maker.
[02:20:02.119 --> 02:20:03.643]  Of the film of Dogs and Men.
[02:20:03.663 --> 02:20:06.531]  And it's time has come.
[02:20:06.571 --> 02:20:07.634]  It needs to be seen by people.
[02:20:10.144 --> 02:20:18.047]  Virtually anyone can hack your cell phone and track your calls, your texts, your emails, your every movement, but only if they can detect a signal.
[02:20:18.387 --> 02:20:22.048]  Stay one step ahead of hackers and Big Brother with a Blockit Pocket.

[02:20:40.362 --> 02:20:41.463]  We've all heard the news stories.
[02:20:41.923 --> 02:20:42.644]  Another shooting.
[02:20:43.064 --> 02:20:44.325]  And they're getting worse.
[02:20:44.765 --> 02:20:47.987]  That's why Infidel Body Armor introduces Infidel Fridays.

[02:21:09.073 --> 02:21:09.974]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[02:21:10.034 --> 02:21:10.434]  Good, brother.
[02:21:10.594 --> 02:21:12.295]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:21:12.315 --> 02:21:14.136]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:21:14.257 --> 02:21:18.259]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:21:18.279 --> 02:21:19.020]  Well, thank you, brother.
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:23.143]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:21:23.343 --> 02:21:31.188]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[02:21:34.733 --> 02:21:36.235]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:21:36.275 --> 02:21:39.179]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:21:39.319 --> 02:21:40.701]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:21:40.981 --> 02:21:43.424]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[02:21:45.521 --> 02:21:48.622]  And then concentrated or maximum potency.
[02:21:48.802 --> 02:22:00.766]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience where a stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[02:22:00.826 --> 02:22:07.769]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:22:08.809 --> 02:22:12.294]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:22:13.055 --> 02:22:13.556]  It's true.
[02:22:13.676 --> 02:22:17.642]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:22:17.822 --> 02:22:19.685]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:22:20.225 --> 02:22:24.692]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:22:24.992 --> 02:22:37.597]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[02:23:08.888 --> 02:23:13.231]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[02:23:13.331 --> 02:23:18.074]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[02:23:18.194 --> 02:23:22.077]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease.
[02:23:22.237 --> 02:23:25.659]  And a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[02:23:25.899 --> 02:23:28.440]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:32.942]  I've taken whey protein products for years, and I've never noticed results I had with your product.
[02:23:33.022 --> 02:23:35.984]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life.
[02:23:36.204 --> 02:23:40.066]  Within a few days of taking One World Whey, I noticed a dramatic change.
[02:23:40.526 --> 02:23:44.248]  Also, in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[02:23:44.448 --> 02:23:47.910]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar, and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[02:23:48.670 --> 02:23:48.910]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:23:48.970 --> 02:23:49.610]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:23:49.751 --> 02:23:51.331]  Or visit oneworldway.com.
[02:23:51.391 --> 02:23:52.852]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[02:24:18.470 --> 02:24:22.612]  Well, I won't back down.
[02:24:22.692 --> 02:24:25.453]  No, I won't back down.
[02:24:26.893 --> 02:24:34.036]  You can stand me up at the gates of hell, but I won't back down.
[02:24:35.436 --> 02:24:39.097]  Gonna stand my ground.
[02:24:39.678 --> 02:24:41.318]  Won't be turned around.
[02:24:44.781 --> 02:24:46.503]  Michael Osias is our guest.
[02:24:46.543 --> 02:24:48.465]  The new documentary film of Dogs and Men.
[02:24:48.906 --> 02:24:50.648]  When is the film coming out?
[02:24:50.908 --> 02:24:53.291]  When can the public get it on DVD?
[02:24:53.351 --> 02:24:54.733]  Or is this going to go through a process?
[02:24:55.394 --> 02:24:56.716]  Where is the production right now?
[02:24:58.669 --> 02:25:03.174]  Right now the film is, I would say, 90-some percent done.
[02:25:03.434 --> 02:25:14.206]  It's almost there, but the primary obstacle that we're facing with the release is just finding the home for it distribution-wise.
[02:25:14.607 --> 02:25:18.831]  So as soon as we find that and we know where that is, we'll know when the release date will be.
[02:25:19.915 --> 02:25:22.976]  Well, this is the type of film that needs to be on HBO.
[02:25:23.056 --> 02:25:25.096]  This is the type of film that needs to be seen.
[02:25:25.377 --> 02:25:27.837]  And if the system got behind it, it'd be a big hit, too.
[02:25:28.818 --> 02:25:31.478]  But the establishment just wants things to continue the way it is.
[02:25:32.579 --> 02:25:34.779]  And, you know, for me, it's not about attacking the police.
[02:25:34.839 --> 02:25:35.519]  They're citizens.
[02:25:35.539 --> 02:25:36.280]  They live here, too.
[02:25:36.860 --> 02:25:38.600]  They're in the middle of this big, phony drug war.
[02:25:39.020 --> 02:25:40.281]  A lot of them are good men and women.
[02:25:41.567 --> 02:25:53.492]  You know, just the whole death squad, no-knock raids, it's what you get in North Korea or Venezuela or Nazi Germany, and it just needs to be curtailed.
[02:25:53.952 --> 02:25:55.773]  And that's the national debate we've been having.
[02:25:56.173 --> 02:25:57.373]  We just want to slow it down.
[02:25:57.433 --> 02:25:58.134]  I mean, that'd be good.
[02:25:58.174 --> 02:25:59.254]  It's just growing, growing.
[02:25:59.854 --> 02:26:01.415]  Where do you think all this is going to end?
[02:26:01.455 --> 02:26:03.276]  Because the biggest thing I've found
[02:26:04.236 --> 02:26:04.916]  That's the public.
[02:26:05.336 --> 02:26:09.398]  Libertarian, conservative, liberal especially, really are starting to hate the police.
[02:26:11.278 --> 02:26:15.740]  And the biggest thing they say is, have you seen them kill those dogs, those little dogs?
[02:26:16.340 --> 02:26:19.281]  People, people really are getting freaked out by this.
[02:26:20.899 --> 02:26:31.462]  Well, I think it's easier for people to wrap their head around because when you hear about these incidents and it involves a person, there's always this thought about, well, what did he do?
[02:26:32.022 --> 02:26:35.583]  What did this person do that provoked the situation in the first place?
[02:26:35.623 --> 02:26:38.804]  But in the case of the dog, they're born innocent.
[02:26:38.984 --> 02:26:44.085]  Even in the stories that we hear about where the dog may have behaved aggressively,
[02:26:44.685 --> 02:26:49.629]  It's still our nature to, we just, we naturally understand that the dog is not born that way.
[02:26:49.709 --> 02:26:51.971]  Somebody trained the dog to be that way.
[02:26:52.031 --> 02:26:55.233]  There's still a level of human culpability on the end of it.
[02:26:55.293 --> 02:26:59.256]  And the dogs are, uh, are the ones who are paying the price.
[02:27:00.637 --> 02:27:10.925]  Well, but I mean, these videos where a chihuahua is just barking on the side of the street so you shoot it, or the new video, we can put it on screen where the cop just shoots the dog over the fence.
[02:27:10.965 --> 02:27:14.228]  What's, I mean, what's the point?
[02:27:15.669 --> 02:27:31.994]  It's well there there is there isn't one and uh in our interviews we um you know and doing the interviews for the documentary we talked to we talked to people who had lost their dogs we talked to politicians we talked to but we we talked to cops as well and there are a lot of
[02:27:33.014 --> 02:27:36.916]  People in law enforcement who are not happy about this situation either.
[02:27:37.036 --> 02:27:37.956]  They want it to end.
[02:27:38.236 --> 02:27:42.198]  Of course, the Chihuahua does not pass the smell test for anybody.
[02:27:42.258 --> 02:27:47.741]  You know, I mean, it's just there's no expert witness that is going to come help you.
[02:27:48.041 --> 02:27:54.383]  Well, let's say you're in a real drug house, because even though the drug works fine, you can have some scum involved, and you're in there and a Chihuahua's running at you.
[02:27:54.924 --> 02:27:56.064]  Kick it or something.
[02:27:56.084 --> 02:27:57.165]  It'll run off.
[02:27:57.225 --> 02:27:58.085]  Why shoot it?
[02:27:58.985 --> 02:28:00.186]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:28:02.155 --> 02:28:15.986]  I don't know, and we've asked that question because it seems like the idea that the dog as a distraction in a chaotic situation would be a justification for shooting it, it just doesn't sound right.
[02:28:16.086 --> 02:28:17.167]  You know what's a distraction?
[02:28:17.207 --> 02:28:17.827]  The drug war.
[02:28:19.769 --> 02:28:20.530]  I'm sorry, say again Alex?
[02:28:20.570 --> 02:28:22.111]  The drug war is the distraction.
[02:28:22.511 --> 02:28:26.674]  We have more drugs on the streets than ever, the banks are laundering the money, it's a total fraud.
[02:28:26.915 --> 02:28:29.817]  Where do you see all this ending if it continues to escalate?
[02:28:31.536 --> 02:28:33.878]  I think there's really two ways that this can happen.
[02:28:34.078 --> 02:28:44.248]  If people become aware of it, if they ask their local police department what they're doing about it, if things are done proactively in advance of a terrible incident happening.
[02:28:44.268 --> 02:28:50.334]  I mean, really, we're beating this problem one city at a time as a terrible incident gets a lot of press and all that.
[02:28:50.914 --> 02:28:54.136]  But if it's proactive, then we can solve it.
[02:28:54.236 --> 02:29:03.042]  Culturally, we can move the dog away from property and closer to family and police culture because that's how we view them in citizen culture.
[02:29:03.122 --> 02:29:10.967]  So if we can do that and they can help us proactively, then together we can solve the problem probably quickly and painlessly.
[02:29:10.987 --> 02:29:11.708]  But if they don't,
[02:29:12.328 --> 02:29:16.149]  The number of people who are upset about this is growing.
[02:29:16.209 --> 02:29:17.810]  Legislation is passing.
[02:29:18.370 --> 02:29:20.831]  Mandates for training are passing.
[02:29:20.891 --> 02:29:22.571]  And the lawsuits are piling up.
[02:29:22.631 --> 02:29:24.332]  And the payouts are getting bigger and bigger.
[02:29:24.352 --> 02:29:24.832]  That's right.
[02:29:24.912 --> 02:29:26.072]  It's not going away.
[02:29:26.152 --> 02:29:27.773]  And it's only going to get more painful.
[02:29:27.813 --> 02:29:28.133]  That's right.
[02:29:28.153 --> 02:29:28.773]  None of this is.
[02:29:28.793 --> 02:29:32.794]  Well, look, we're going to have you back on the Nightly News in the next few weeks and follow your film as it comes out.
[02:29:32.854 --> 02:29:33.535]  Thank you for the time.
[02:29:33.875 --> 02:29:36.896]  But they have huge funerals for police dogs that don't want to do anything.
[02:29:37.176 --> 02:29:37.276]  Fine.
[02:29:37.296 --> 02:29:37.736]  I love dogs.
[02:29:37.816 --> 02:29:38.736]  I'm a dog lover.
[02:29:39.016 --> 02:29:39.356]  Big time.
[02:29:41.677 --> 02:29:44.860]  It's just they stand up for their families, that's why they're being killed.
[02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:46.701]  The cats could care less, so they're fine.
[02:29:47.242 --> 02:29:49.203]  I don't hate cats, but compared to dogs, give me a break.
[02:29:49.523 --> 02:29:50.844]  Oh, look at that cutie pie!
[02:29:53.166 --> 02:29:54.127]  Who is that terrorist?
[02:29:54.988 --> 02:29:55.928]  His name is Freedom.
[02:29:56.529 --> 02:29:57.770]  Oh my gosh, even worse!
[02:29:57.810 --> 02:29:58.550]  He is a terrorist.
[02:29:58.851 --> 02:29:59.771]  Thank you so much, brother.
[02:29:59.791 --> 02:30:00.692]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:30:00.732 --> 02:30:01.633]  We'll be back.
[02:30:01.813 --> 02:30:03.654]  We have huge news on Jade Helms.
[02:30:10.834 --> 02:30:15.576]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now.
[02:30:16.317 --> 02:30:21.179]  And if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation, well I'll tell you how.
[02:30:21.699 --> 02:30:27.202]  When the Democrats showed their true colors, you got angry and you elected Republicans.
[02:30:27.722 --> 02:30:32.965]  And then when the Republicans showed their true colors, you got angry and elected Democrats.
[02:30:33.405 --> 02:30:43.492]  And when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best interest, you acted like they were crazy.
[02:30:44.072 --> 02:30:51.798]  But the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
[02:30:52.298 --> 02:30:58.102]  That's why it is vitally important that you wake up, America, and break the matrix.
[02:30:58.563 --> 02:31:03.514]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Show.
[02:31:03.955 --> 02:31:06.340]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:31:09.480 --> 02:31:10.341]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:31:10.421 --> 02:31:10.841]  Good, brother.
[02:31:10.981 --> 02:31:12.663]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:31:12.943 --> 02:31:14.505]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:31:14.665 --> 02:31:18.669]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:31:18.689 --> 02:31:21.271]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.

[02:31:49.220 --> 02:32:01.190]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where a stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[02:32:38.706 --> 02:32:49.271]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:32:49.551 --> 02:32:53.134]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[02:33:04.144 --> 02:33:05.045]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:33:19.824 --> 02:33:23.967]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:24.707 --> 02:33:26.188]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.888 --> 02:33:49.122]  We're going to be getting into some serious research into the Pentagon's domestic role and operations that are undenied here in the
[02:33:50.967 --> 02:33:51.347]  We're good to go.
[02:34:21.334 --> 02:34:23.887]  I want to talk about the infowar itself.
[02:34:25.589 --> 02:34:50.923]  Notice yesterday, we have a leading gentleman on who's dealing with taking these food deserts, these food prisons, these areas with all of this right-of-way and city area in front of the yards, and letting people, by getting laws passed, by just doing it at first, forcing the tyrants to try to arrest you, then pointing out it's tyranny, then getting the law changed, to plant gardens in basically your front yards.
[02:34:51.523 --> 02:34:52.323]  Wow, what a free country!
[02:34:52.343 --> 02:34:52.784]  We can do that!
[02:34:53.604 --> 02:34:57.105]  And to use unused public lance, Ron Finley.
[02:34:58.026 --> 02:35:03.808]  Today, we're battling the UN treaties and the TPP treaties to go after the Second Amendment.
[02:35:05.569 --> 02:35:07.069]  We're battling their stealth attacks.
[02:35:07.429 --> 02:35:12.991]  Then we have a guest on exposing the program to execute dogs during police encounters.
[02:35:13.852 --> 02:35:17.133]  Just because they're not in control of the situation, the dog won't shut up.
[02:35:17.833 --> 02:35:18.794]  And so it has to die.
[02:35:20.154 --> 02:35:21.955]  You ask questions, you have to be tasered.
[02:35:22.836 --> 02:35:32.758]  This pain compliance, torture compliance, this conversion to a tyranny, and now we're going to be covering Jade Helm, and how that ties into the bigger picture.
[02:35:33.238 --> 02:35:35.999]  This is a precious operation, and I know you know that.
[02:35:36.959 --> 02:35:51.762]  I wake up every morning, and I go to bed every night as well, and just remind myself, hey, keep your nose clean, do a really good job, focus on what you're doing, be productive, be accurate, be truthful, check your ego at the door, and realize you're part of something big.
[02:35:52.901 --> 02:36:00.843]  And all of you, the listeners and viewers, are part of something really, really big as well.
[02:36:01.884 --> 02:36:12.387]  Because the globalists are all about making us feel calm while they anesthetize us, while they basically dismantle our culture, our society.
[02:36:13.387 --> 02:36:22.631]  But you read their books and white papers and statements, I mean, they are exterminists, transhumanists, eugenicists, the nastiest, most cold-hearted psychopaths you can imagine.
[02:36:23.011 --> 02:36:27.273]  David Knight was just pointing out earlier that, you know, it's psychopaths that like to hurt little animals.
[02:36:28.041 --> 02:36:35.123]  It's one thing, you know, but then they extend and say gutting a deer is psychopathic or putting a hook in a, you know, or taking a hook out of a fish's mouth is psychopathic.
[02:36:35.163 --> 02:36:36.024]  No, that's just farming.
[02:36:36.064 --> 02:36:36.984]  That's just hunting.
[02:36:37.184 --> 02:36:45.127]  But people that like to torture animals, you know, George W. Bush liked to put firecrackers in the mouths of frogs and blow them up live.
[02:36:46.047 --> 02:36:50.148]  I remember I'd see kids doing stuff like that when I was a kid and I was kind of like, you know, I don't like, that's a living frog.
[02:36:51.929 --> 02:36:53.189]  You know, I think that's gross.
[02:36:53.329 --> 02:36:55.010]  And it wasn't like I was some bleeding heart.
[02:36:56.502 --> 02:37:00.484]  It's just that I had empathy, and they want us to have a lack of empathy.
[02:37:01.664 --> 02:37:17.590]  So that when we see our neighbor being drug off, or the CPS taking somebody's kids, or the globalists restricting somebody else's free speech, we just keep our head down like gazelles and hope that the lions will get another animal.
[02:37:19.534 --> 02:37:25.721]  Or like a deer in the forest of India, we hope the tiger just grabs one of the other deer and, you know, it's gonna be us tomorrow, but so what?
[02:37:26.162 --> 02:37:31.968]  We're not prey animals like cottontail rabbits.
[02:37:33.250 --> 02:37:33.790]  We are...
[02:37:34.998 --> 02:37:37.020]  Not domesticated idiots.
[02:37:37.580 --> 02:37:41.984]  But they're trying to make us behave and act like that.
[02:37:42.605 --> 02:37:45.868]  And I don't care if it's the military, the police, corporate systems, whatever.
[02:37:46.088 --> 02:37:46.829]  There's cultures.
[02:37:47.369 --> 02:37:53.494]  And there is a culture of oppression, a culture of hive dronism.
[02:37:54.215 --> 02:38:22.863]  that's going on to make us conform into different uh... controlled groups uh... and organizations and it's time for us to break free of that you don't have to subscribe uh... or prescribe to what we're saying simply no on every historical yardstick measurement if we had dials in front of us they'd all be pegged red alert the ship's on fire the ship sinking tyranny is
[02:38:24.361 --> 02:38:24.882]  Racing.
[02:38:27.104 --> 02:38:28.264]  Because of technology.
[02:38:28.445 --> 02:38:30.266]  We can also use technology to fight tyranny.
[02:38:30.847 --> 02:38:41.536]  But more importantly, we're fighting complacency, the acclimation, the normalcy bias, the learned helplessness.
[02:38:41.556 --> 02:38:47.481]  We really do have a mass Stockholm Syndrome worldwide where we
[02:38:49.033 --> 02:38:51.433]  Identify and begin to submit to our oppressors.
[02:38:52.214 --> 02:38:58.555]  Now, the globalists then play the other end of that, and we are becoming oppressed, we are being tyrannized.
[02:38:59.295 --> 02:39:09.377]  So then they sell mindless burning and shooting, not against the actual rulers, the controllers, but against local systems that aren't even fully controlled by them yet.
[02:39:09.717 --> 02:39:14.178]  Then in the name of reforming them, they're going to come in and take them over and bring you something ten times worse.
[02:39:14.998 --> 02:39:31.163]  And so in that, we need to appeal to the noble side of bureaucrats, police, ourselves, corporate people, business people, and demand the change we want to see on what restaurants serve, on what grocery stores sell, on the policies, on how the CPS behaves.
[02:39:31.543 --> 02:39:41.386]  We're going to get more done challenging them and showing them how they're being manipulated because most people are just busy, they're under peer pressure, they're following a narrative.
[02:39:42.278 --> 02:39:43.218]  They don't have any honor.
[02:39:44.099 --> 02:39:50.541]  And it's not that they're dishonorable because they're innately dishonorable.
[02:39:50.821 --> 02:40:03.785]  They've been moving too fast their whole life, sat in front of a television, put into prayer pressure, put into this gold-based, regurgitation-based education system that isn't about education but about brainwashing to where they can't even communicate.
[02:40:04.186 --> 02:40:06.646]  They can't even grasp the ideas we're talking about.
[02:40:06.967 --> 02:40:08.047]  They have no connection to the
[02:40:09.531 --> 02:40:20.200]  Legendary struggle of humanity against oppression and tyranny and just to have ideas and be able to have your own garden in Japanese imperial oppression.
[02:40:21.809 --> 02:40:28.491]  And under the show guns, they had a feudalism where you could not grow plants for food unless it was authorized you to give a certain percentage.
[02:40:29.011 --> 02:40:31.831]  It was even more oppressive in Europe in the Dark Ages.
[02:40:32.532 --> 02:40:37.413]  You couldn't even have herbs or anything for people being sick or they'd burn you at the stake saying it was witchcraft.
[02:40:37.773 --> 02:40:39.833]  There was a total oppression.
[02:40:40.333 --> 02:40:47.195]  The globalists described at the Club of Rome in their 1960s publications that we covered in Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement,
[02:40:48.669 --> 02:40:55.613]  They describe in great detail a neo-feudalistic system they want to visit upon us.
[02:40:55.653 --> 02:40:56.233]  That's their work.
[02:40:57.934 --> 02:41:00.015]  So everything you see is a replay.
[02:41:00.876 --> 02:41:05.098]  Carbon taxes is a tax on all human activity, not about the environment.
[02:41:06.819 --> 02:41:08.219]  All of this is about total control.
[02:41:08.460 --> 02:41:13.122]  All over the country, you can't get a tax credit for putting in your own solar or your own wind.
[02:41:13.442 --> 02:41:14.743]  You've got to put it into their system.
[02:41:18.407 --> 02:41:20.528]  You see, they don't want you independent.
[02:41:20.989 --> 02:41:23.770]  They don't want us coming together as normal humans.
[02:41:24.451 --> 02:41:25.491]  You want to defeat the globalists?
[02:41:25.511 --> 02:41:28.353]  Start having your neighbors over to barbecue them, no matter what color they are.
[02:41:29.274 --> 02:41:30.434]  You want to defeat the globalists?
[02:41:30.615 --> 02:41:31.835]  Start starting a garden.
[02:41:32.296 --> 02:41:33.196]  Go to city council.
[02:41:33.236 --> 02:41:34.657]  Just see what's happening.
[02:41:34.737 --> 02:41:36.598]  Go to a homeless soup kitchen.
[02:41:36.638 --> 02:41:37.459]  See what's happening there.
[02:41:37.859 --> 02:41:40.301]  Go to a police event that's open to the public.
[02:41:40.341 --> 02:41:41.141]  Talk to the police.
[02:41:41.421 --> 02:41:43.022]  They don't want us interfacing with each other.
[02:41:43.222 --> 02:41:44.823]  They want us all just fighting with each other.
[02:41:45.023 --> 02:41:46.644]  We're going home and watching ESPN.
[02:41:49.289 --> 02:41:58.831]  In closing, and then we're going to give you the new Jade Helm news, and what's behind so much of this conversion of our military to a domestic force that's admitted.
[02:42:01.431 --> 02:42:02.632]  That's why we need to be supported.
[02:42:03.032 --> 02:42:04.512]  Spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:42:04.932 --> 02:42:07.653]  Facebook, after a massive backlash, restored our Facebook.
[02:42:08.593 --> 02:42:12.474]  They banned the lady up in Merlin who put on the event.
[02:42:12.514 --> 02:42:13.074]  They banned her.
[02:42:13.474 --> 02:42:15.514]  After a huge protest, her site was put back up.
[02:42:16.094 --> 02:42:17.255]  Regardless of what you think of her.
[02:42:19.790 --> 02:42:20.651]  That's her First Amendment.
[02:42:21.051 --> 02:42:22.793]  She loses the First Amendment, we lose it all.
[02:42:25.016 --> 02:42:26.077]  That's what this comes down to.
[02:42:27.358 --> 02:42:28.419]  We need your support.
[02:42:28.559 --> 02:42:29.980]  Spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:31.561]  Tell your friends and family about it.
[02:42:31.621 --> 02:42:32.881]  The power of millions of people.
[02:42:33.682 --> 02:42:49.471]  Taking the link at InfoWars.com forward slash show with the free podcast, the audio streams, the video streams, the free apps, sending it to friends and family, putting it at the end of your emails or the top of your emails, putting it on Facebook, putting it on Twitter, putting it on YouTube, putting it on Pinterest, putting it on Craigslist.
[02:42:50.372 --> 02:42:52.133]  I've just started plugging this last three weeks.
[02:42:52.373 --> 02:42:55.275]  We've more than tripled the amount of people just watching the video feed.
[02:42:56.494 --> 02:42:59.095]  What if you tell folks about your local AM and FM affiliates?
[02:42:59.515 --> 02:43:04.117]  What if you, in that geographic area, tell them about that affiliate, the call letters, and when we're on?
[02:43:04.738 --> 02:43:06.398]  This is the power you have!
[02:43:06.438 --> 02:43:08.960]  They're coming after us because, look at it!
[02:43:10.140 --> 02:43:18.904]  You type InfoWars.com into Google, you click News, and there are conservatively 30-40 articles and TV shows a day talking about it.
[02:43:19.676 --> 02:43:23.481]  You type in InfoWars Jade Helmer, InfoWars Alex Jones, hundreds a day.
[02:43:24.042 --> 02:43:25.824]  And it's always new stuff we're breaking.
[02:43:26.145 --> 02:43:28.808]  We break the news about homeschoolers having their kids taken.
[02:43:28.969 --> 02:43:30.731]  It becomes national news, they get their kids back.
[02:43:31.432 --> 02:43:33.114]  We break the news about any issue.
[02:43:33.956 --> 02:43:36.938]  You heard Larry Pratt say today, thank God you're covering this, Alex.
[02:43:36.958 --> 02:43:38.018]  He's told me before off the air.
[02:43:38.298 --> 02:43:39.659]  Biggest response off this show.
[02:43:39.959 --> 02:43:43.361]  Bigger than the other hosts that are on 500 stations.
[02:43:43.701 --> 02:43:45.022]  We're on 170-something?
[02:43:45.462 --> 02:43:46.243]  Most of them small?
[02:43:46.603 --> 02:43:48.064]  Bigger than Glenn Beck.
[02:43:48.544 --> 02:43:49.845]  Bigger than Rush Limbaugh.
[02:43:50.265 --> 02:43:51.325]  Bigger than Sean Hannity.
[02:43:51.486 --> 02:43:52.326]  Let me be honest with you.
[02:43:52.566 --> 02:43:55.328]  I wish they would convert to liberty immediately and dwarf me.
[02:43:55.368 --> 02:43:56.108]  This is dangerous.
[02:43:56.588 --> 02:43:57.889]  I don't want to be at this level.
[02:43:58.850 --> 02:43:59.290]  Believe me.
[02:44:00.438 --> 02:44:06.344]  But I knew I had to get big or get destroyed, so I'm getting as big as I can in the face of these enemies so I can contend with them.
[02:44:06.824 --> 02:44:07.865]  That's what this comes down to.
[02:44:08.666 --> 02:44:08.946]  Okay?
[02:44:08.986 --> 02:44:11.088]  If I'm going to go and risk my life, I'm going to go all the way.
[02:44:11.288 --> 02:44:12.309]  So join us in that.
[02:44:12.389 --> 02:44:13.911]  Go to m4store.com.

[02:44:40.236 --> 02:44:42.938]  Now, shifting gears into the really big subject.
[02:44:43.759 --> 02:44:48.182]  I've been aware of this program for years, but listeners contacted us.
[02:44:48.222 --> 02:44:49.023]  We looked into it.
[02:44:49.363 --> 02:44:50.744]  David Knight, Rob Dubb.
[02:44:51.244 --> 02:44:58.170]  We did a lot of research, and we know about the domestic plans to take on the Patriot movement, to take on the gun owners, to take on the veterans.
[02:44:58.890 --> 02:45:00.051]  That's in hundreds of publications.
[02:45:00.071 --> 02:45:02.373]  We know the Pentagon's new main role domestically is that.
[02:45:02.893 --> 02:45:04.835]  That's over-the-top insane.
[02:45:05.555 --> 02:45:06.696]  Then Jade Helm comes along.
[02:45:06.716 --> 02:45:07.977]  We just say this should be watched.
[02:45:08.358 --> 02:45:09.959]  It lists these states as hostile.
[02:45:10.399 --> 02:45:16.485]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act admits the military is preparing to put down legislative rebellions or to take out governors.
[02:45:16.585 --> 02:45:17.305]  That's in the news.
[02:45:17.926 --> 02:45:18.827]  We should watch this.
[02:45:18.927 --> 02:45:21.489]  They misrepresent, say that we say it's an imminent takeover.
[02:45:23.706 --> 02:45:25.646]  It's now one of the biggest stories the last month.
[02:45:25.807 --> 02:45:26.767]  It just gets bigger and bigger.
[02:45:26.787 --> 02:45:27.907]  They're calling it a firestorm.
[02:45:28.707 --> 02:45:43.211]  But it's admitted that the Pentagon is tracking everything we do, putting it into this Internet of Things, this map that tracks the whole world, and that creates a file on every American, and then files on regions and sub-regions of the country.
[02:45:43.591 --> 02:45:47.312]  And that's what David Knight and, of course, Rob Dewar are here to talk about.
[02:45:47.352 --> 02:45:49.732]  We may have to do some overdrive today to get into all this.
[02:45:50.253 --> 02:45:51.773]  But gentlemen, where should we start here?
[02:45:52.333 --> 02:45:54.034]  There's a ton of stuff on here.
[02:45:54.234 --> 02:45:56.155]  I think we should start with the C-SPAN clip.
[02:45:56.195 --> 02:45:57.816]  We broke that down a couple days ago.
[02:45:57.856 --> 02:46:00.057]  The Sleeping Giant Awakens on live TV.
[02:46:00.617 --> 02:46:02.218]  And there's one of the questions.
[02:46:02.278 --> 02:46:06.540]  Someone calls in to talk to the Colonel, who is head of the Asymmetrical Warfare Group.
[02:46:06.821 --> 02:46:07.881]  He's the commander of this.
[02:46:07.941 --> 02:46:08.982]  Colonel John Potosik.
[02:46:09.522 --> 02:46:11.423]  They say, hey, why don't you tell us about J-FILM?
[02:46:11.483 --> 02:46:12.864]  We think it's a cool little exercise.
[02:46:12.904 --> 02:46:16.906]  You know, I know she was trying to bait the guy into an argument.
[02:46:16.946 --> 02:46:17.546]  He looks over.
[02:46:17.586 --> 02:46:20.768]  You see him look off screen, shake his head, and goes, I don't know anything about that.
[02:46:21.368 --> 02:46:24.351]  I mean, it's an amazing clip, and this was on C-SPAN Live.
[02:46:24.791 --> 02:46:25.832]  And he's at Fort A.P.
[02:46:25.872 --> 02:46:28.234]  Hill, where Briggs and I were about a year ago.
[02:46:28.534 --> 02:46:29.515]  He's in Fort A.P.
[02:46:29.535 --> 02:46:29.715]  Hill.
[02:46:29.735 --> 02:46:30.496]  They're doing the interview.
[02:46:30.536 --> 02:46:31.897]  He knows all about it, but he knows nothing.
[02:46:31.917 --> 02:46:32.498]  He knows nothing.
[02:46:32.558 --> 02:46:34.780]  He's a leading expert, but he knows nothing.
[02:46:34.820 --> 02:46:35.921]  Well, he does the Sgt.
[02:46:35.941 --> 02:46:38.183]  Schultz defense, and I explain that in the clip.
[02:46:38.223 --> 02:46:39.644]  So, let's go to that clip real quick.
[02:46:40.410 --> 02:46:41.591]  Let me have you, Jane.
[02:46:41.611 --> 02:46:42.631]  Yeah, yeah, this is the guy.
[02:46:57.401 --> 02:47:00.906]  Could you explain the magnitude of that and what the purpose of that is?
[02:47:01.627 --> 02:47:06.653]  Apparently you're going to have crisis actors and there are going to be soldiers dressed in uniform and not in uniform.
[02:47:06.713 --> 02:47:08.155]  Apparently it's very exciting.
[02:47:08.416 --> 02:47:09.557]  Could you explain that to us?
[02:47:09.918 --> 02:47:10.599]  Thank you very much.
[02:47:13.275 --> 02:47:17.597]  Unfortunately, it's not something that I'm familiar with, so I can't really explain that.
[02:47:18.138 --> 02:47:28.863]  But I do know that those type of things are things that we do here, where we get our soldiers the opportunity to work within an environment where there are civilians and soldiers.
[02:47:28.923 --> 02:47:34.847]  As a matter of fact, one of the things I could talk about is that, unfortunately, I just don't know about that particular exercise.
[02:47:34.867 --> 02:47:36.387]  I know nothing!
[02:47:36.467 --> 02:47:37.188]  I know nothing!
[02:47:37.908 --> 02:47:43.032]  The Army's plan for a multi-state training exercise this summer called Jade Helm 15.
[02:47:43.593 --> 02:47:50.318]  While the military says it's just training soldiers for the realities of war, critics say the Army is preparing for modern-day martial law.
[02:47:50.738 --> 02:47:52.339]  Some are calling it a Texas takeover.
[02:47:52.399 --> 02:48:05.409]  What's happening is between July and September, a bunch of Green Berets, Navy SEALs and Special Ops from the Air Force and Marines are conducting some realistic training exercises across the Southwest, including 17 different Texas cities.
[02:48:05.649 --> 02:48:08.210]  Again, I'm sorry, I'm just not familiar with that exercise.
[02:48:23.655 --> 02:48:30.658]  Now, expanding on this, we're getting into part two of a video that's up on Infowars.com, proof Pentagon mapping U.S.
[02:48:30.978 --> 02:48:34.640]  for domestic insurgents, including libertarians, constitutionalists, and patriots.
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.742]  What we're getting into is an event that's been happening for about eight years.
[02:48:38.182 --> 02:48:39.543]  We've got some C-SPAN clips from...
[02:48:40.623 --> 02:48:47.548]  Five years ago, it's dominating the human domain analytics, and we get this from Trajectory Magazine.
[02:48:47.568 --> 02:48:55.334]  So you've got to go into the different Pentagon publications, the different trade publications to find this directly from them, what they're actually doing.
[02:48:55.754 --> 02:48:59.795]  You know, Alex, when we look at this and we saw this, it's like, okay, here it comes again.
[02:48:59.835 --> 02:49:01.676]  We've been talking about all these different aspects of it.
[02:49:02.076 --> 02:49:03.136]  This is another exercise.
[02:49:03.196 --> 02:49:03.576]  It's bigger.
[02:49:03.596 --> 02:49:04.497]  They're increasing the scope.
[02:49:04.517 --> 02:49:05.537]  They're increasing the frequency.
[02:49:06.097 --> 02:49:09.538]  We were all surprised, I think, to see how this picked up, how Jade Helm picked up.
[02:49:09.558 --> 02:49:12.459]  But I think the thing is, it's like the Snowden files.
[02:49:12.879 --> 02:49:16.480]  When you see the documents, when you see the slides, it hits with people.
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:17.740]  And they see this map.
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:18.861]  That's what Lou Gohmert said.
[02:49:18.901 --> 02:49:20.321]  He said, I was in the Army as an officer.
[02:49:20.621 --> 02:49:21.901]  This is scary.
[02:49:22.101 --> 02:49:23.742]  I'm concerned about martial law.
[02:49:23.882 --> 02:49:35.671]  That's just the tip of the iceberg, because what this is about, this is, when they say mastering the human domain, when you look at that logo, human domain is a term of art of the military, just like unconventional warfare, just like asymmetric warfare.
[02:49:35.691 --> 02:49:37.813]  It means the entire ecosystem, everybody.
[02:49:37.953 --> 02:49:38.413]  Exactly.
[02:49:38.853 --> 02:49:39.514]  It means slavery.
[02:49:39.734 --> 02:49:48.341]  They are getting all this information about you as an individual, and as different groups, and they are mapping it onto a geographic label, layer.
[02:49:48.381 --> 02:49:49.441]  It's full spectrum dominance.
[02:49:49.521 --> 02:49:49.922]  Exactly.
[02:49:50.402 --> 02:50:00.187]  Yeah, and there's the logo right there, Master of the Human Domain, and the conference... And notice, it's the same... They call it Master of the Human Domain, and that's the name of these programs.
[02:50:00.207 --> 02:50:02.428]  So we were just searching what they meant by that.
[02:50:02.548 --> 02:50:05.550]  This, they admit, is for domestic activity.
[02:50:06.070 --> 02:50:07.551]  So we got them, it is domestic?
[02:50:07.811 --> 02:50:08.551]  It totally is.
[02:50:08.571 --> 02:50:09.652]  When you look at these conferences...
[02:50:10.592 --> 02:50:15.454]  Alex, when you look at these conferences, when you look at the history, they tie it intimately in with law enforcement.
[02:50:15.494 --> 02:50:18.175]  So you guys went back and looked at what is mattering to the human domain.
[02:50:18.415 --> 02:50:21.636]  You've got all the Pentagon briefings where they admit it's tracking everything we do.
[02:50:21.696 --> 02:50:22.176]  It's for us.
[02:50:22.436 --> 02:50:26.598]  These conferences, they've got James Clapper, the NSA, the Homeland Security are there, U.S.
[02:50:26.618 --> 02:50:27.598]  Geological Service.
[02:50:27.838 --> 02:50:28.959]  This is domestic.
[02:50:29.219 --> 02:50:31.139]  It is melded with law enforcement.
[02:50:31.159 --> 02:50:32.500]  It's the Rural Affairs Committee.
[02:50:33.300 --> 02:50:35.702]  Yes, as much intel operation as it is a military operation.
[02:50:35.722 --> 02:50:38.423]  That's what I'm saying, this is to test the locals, this is for the rollout.
[02:50:38.703 --> 02:50:47.409]  And what they're doing is using Facebook, Twitter, anything you put out online, they're using that, collecting that data and going, well this is out of the ordinary, we gotta go investigate.
[02:50:47.449 --> 02:50:54.713]  And see, we're going to force a debate about this Manhattan Project happening beneath the surface, they don't want us to unveil it before it's ready.
[02:50:56.194 --> 02:50:57.035]  It's ridiculously big.
[02:50:57.055 --> 02:50:58.396]  When we come back, we've got some more clips.
[02:50:58.736 --> 02:50:59.397]  It's just going to blow your mind.
[02:50:59.417 --> 02:51:01.038]  Yeah, so what do we call this special report?
[02:51:01.258 --> 02:51:05.882]  Confirm Jade Helm is for domestic operations against American people, at least in part.
[02:51:06.722 --> 02:51:06.982]  Oh yeah.
[02:51:07.022 --> 02:51:07.643]  I mean, we have them.
[02:51:07.883 --> 02:51:08.844]  It's about mastering America.
[02:51:10.180 --> 02:51:16.541]  Heart and Body Extract continues to receive positive testimonials from people who have experienced amazing results, like Reed.
[02:51:16.821 --> 02:51:22.403]  I just wanted to send you a quick but a very big thank you for Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:22.743 --> 02:51:30.645]  I've been on the formula for nearly a month now, and the improvement in the circulation of my legs has been simply amazing.
[02:51:30.825 --> 02:51:32.465]  Reed was facing a tough choice.
[02:51:32.825 --> 02:51:39.772]  I was facing surgery due to the severity of a 100% blocked artery in both my legs.
[02:51:40.173 --> 02:51:49.923]  And my decision, waiting for surgery to say no and try heart and body extract instead, has been thankfully the right decision.
[02:51:50.063 --> 02:51:50.804]  And the result?
[02:51:50.944 --> 02:51:54.428]  I can now walk up steps without noticeable pain.

[02:54:18.386 --> 02:54:21.528]  They're cutting the fluoride back by half, the scientists admitting it's killing everybody.
[02:54:22.009 --> 02:54:27.253]  Infowars.com, RT reports, climate change is a UN-led hoax to create new world order.
[02:54:27.753 --> 02:54:30.596]  That's the Australian Prime Minister and his advisors.
[02:54:30.696 --> 02:54:31.877]  I mean, it's just all coming out.
[02:54:32.157 --> 02:54:37.141]  The dam's breaking, and so the globalists are scrambling, hoping they can train our military to take us on.
[02:54:37.541 --> 02:54:38.222]  Here's what's happening.
[02:54:39.249 --> 02:54:41.010]  We're going to do 30 minutes of Overdrive today.
[02:54:41.350 --> 02:54:42.791]  Some stations carry the fourth hour.
[02:54:42.831 --> 02:54:44.212]  Years ago, I did the fourth hour live.
[02:54:44.232 --> 02:54:45.653]  A lot of stations don't.
[02:54:45.833 --> 02:54:47.795]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:54:48.395 --> 02:54:56.160]  I'm going to go to five after, but we're just going to continue with these guys because Drew wanted to get some of the clips off and get ready and it was about 10 minutes late.
[02:54:56.541 --> 02:55:06.207]  So they're going to do a whole presentation on this coming up, but he's got clip after clip from these dominating the human environment analytics, and that's the Jade Helm logo.
[02:55:06.547 --> 02:55:07.928]  And then we find the same players.
[02:55:07.988 --> 02:55:09.069]  This is for America.
[02:55:09.829 --> 02:55:16.593]  And it's for the globe as well, but it's for mapping everything, taking over local towns, knowing which towns are ready to do it, who isn't.
[02:55:17.414 --> 02:55:18.254]  It's for civil war.
[02:55:19.595 --> 02:55:21.436]  And again, it has dual use as well.
[02:55:21.696 --> 02:55:22.556]  Any training does.
[02:55:22.997 --> 02:55:28.020]  But it's confirmed, this is a big deal, Jade Helm confirmed for domestic operations.
[02:55:28.540 --> 02:55:30.361]  But it's not the takeover.
[02:55:30.421 --> 02:55:31.441]  They're misrepresenting.
[02:55:31.902 --> 02:55:35.984]  And again, they use this as a war game now to see if they can lie to people.
[02:55:36.364 --> 02:55:37.605]  I think the whole thing is a side out.
[02:55:37.665 --> 02:55:38.766]  We're in the midst of it right now.
[02:55:38.786 --> 02:55:40.687]  We're already into it.
[02:55:41.067 --> 02:55:41.907]  Unfortunately, yeah.
[02:55:41.987 --> 02:55:44.849]  But by putting it out there, letting people know about it, they're seeing the reaction.
[02:55:44.869 --> 02:55:45.850]  David's got a ton to cover.
[02:55:45.890 --> 02:55:46.610]  I'll be out of here soon.
[02:55:46.650 --> 02:55:47.390]  He'll get to all of it.
[02:55:47.731 --> 02:55:48.511]  But get to the next clip.
[02:55:48.531 --> 02:55:50.712]  What do you have, dude?
[02:55:50.732 --> 02:55:53.074]  So, they had this 2010 Mastering the Human Domain Conference.
[02:55:53.294 --> 02:56:00.138]  The next year, the open of the 2011 kind of shows everything that they've been talking about and that they've been working on for a year.
[02:56:00.698 --> 02:56:05.339]  So I want to play that, and then we'll go back and show the other clips that kind of, it's like watching paint dry, but we'll get to it.
[02:56:05.359 --> 02:56:06.260]  This is a who's who.
[02:56:06.300 --> 02:56:09.861]  The FEMA head, the Clapper, NSA, top generals.
[02:56:09.881 --> 02:56:11.801]  It's the military and the security complex.
[02:56:11.861 --> 02:56:20.284]  This is them coordinating what Eisenhower warned us of, just like a third world country has taken over by its military, but this is the bureaucracy using it for that.
[02:56:20.544 --> 02:56:23.625]  We just want to debate the fact that we're already in the middle of the takeover.
[02:56:23.665 --> 02:56:24.065]  Here it is.
[02:56:24.825 --> 02:56:29.707]  The threats that we face don't recognize boundaries.
[02:56:30.834 --> 02:56:36.377]  Whether those are physical boundaries, or organizational boundaries, or agency boundaries.
[02:56:37.217 --> 02:56:44.461]  And every time we're inhibited in our response to those threats, by our own boundaries, we lessen our impact.
[02:56:44.842 --> 02:56:51.125]  And when we lessen our impact, we lessen our services to those decision makers, and we ultimately affect our national security in a negative way.
[02:56:51.465 --> 02:56:57.274]  The consequence to the nation if we don't integrate intelligence, I believe simply that we're going to miss things.
[02:56:57.434 --> 02:57:07.088]  And we won't deliver the best possible solution set to our mission partners, whether that's the policy makers, the war fighters, or the first responder.
[02:57:07.729 --> 02:57:11.611]  This type of warfare today... The first responder, the military.
[02:57:11.771 --> 02:57:16.013]  ...require rapid assimilation of information... They're launching drones.
[02:57:16.033 --> 02:57:21.256]  ...rapid understanding in situations where... Remember the Homeland Security video that showed them taking out gun owners in America?
[02:57:21.296 --> 02:57:21.876]  ...intelligence.
[02:57:21.936 --> 02:57:24.818]  It's like fighting with both hands tied behind your back.
[02:57:25.118 --> 02:57:26.518]  Oh, don't tie her hands!
[02:57:28.740 --> 02:57:30.581]  And they put all these Obamanoids in now?
[02:57:31.021 --> 02:57:33.243]  The verge, yeah.
[02:57:33.303 --> 02:57:38.706]  A bunch of social workers now with general outfits.
[02:57:38.726 --> 02:57:39.907]  The U.S., yeah.
[02:57:40.127 --> 02:57:41.808]  Go into the U.S.
[02:57:41.828 --> 02:57:46.852]  Hey, remember the ad in Pennsylvania to pay your taxes was just like that?
[02:57:46.872 --> 02:57:47.672]  Same thing, yeah.
[02:57:48.053 --> 02:57:50.954]  Well, they have Lockheed ads now where it shows them scanning U.S.
[02:57:50.975 --> 02:57:51.235]  cities.
[02:57:52.035 --> 02:57:58.617]  Lockheed helped make this.
[02:57:58.677 --> 02:58:03.618]  But notice that it wasn't all this that stopped those guys up in Dallas, in Garland.
[02:58:03.638 --> 02:58:04.639]  It was the one guy with a gun.
[02:58:05.039 --> 02:58:09.200]  He used his own HUMET to sabotage, this is a target, so an off duty cop went and hung out out front.
[02:58:09.360 --> 02:58:09.520]  Yeah.
[02:58:09.860 --> 02:58:11.022]  I don't know if you noticed that at the end.
[02:58:11.242 --> 02:58:12.443]  They were showing the different layers.
[02:58:12.683 --> 02:58:13.644]  That is what they're building.
[02:58:13.684 --> 02:58:15.526]  They're building different layers of information.
[02:58:15.566 --> 02:58:16.767]  Like, this is a friendly area.
[02:58:16.907 --> 02:58:18.929]  Give us a preview of what's coming up in the next 30 minutes.
[02:58:18.949 --> 02:58:20.210]  You guys can do a whole hour if you want to.
[02:58:20.511 --> 02:58:21.992]  Well, we might be able to.
[02:58:22.232 --> 02:58:22.853]  We got pretty long.
[02:58:23.053 --> 02:58:24.234]  No, I'm committing.
[02:58:24.254 --> 02:58:25.035]  Let's do it.
[02:58:25.055 --> 02:58:26.597]  A whole hour of overdrive.
[02:58:26.617 --> 02:58:27.417]  Tweet it out.
[02:58:27.978 --> 02:58:29.559]  A whole hour of overdrive.
[02:58:29.819 --> 02:58:31.100]  Jade Helm confirmed to be domestic.
[02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:38.444]  I want you to cover and finish it up in the next five, then restart and do a whole treatise over the next 55 minutes, okay?
[02:58:38.905 --> 02:58:40.085]  And let David talk.
[02:58:40.105 --> 02:58:43.428]  Well, there's a huge aspect of this, Alex, that is also predictive.
[02:58:43.488 --> 02:58:45.189]  Because we're seeing that in law enforcement as well.
[02:58:45.229 --> 02:58:48.691]  When they say that the genesis of this came from three different inputs.
[02:58:48.791 --> 02:58:50.772]  One of them was the military in Iraq.
[02:58:51.072 --> 02:58:52.813]  The other is American law enforcement.
[02:58:52.853 --> 02:58:55.415]  And the third one was casinos in Nevada.
[02:58:55.555 --> 02:58:55.875]  That's right.
[02:58:55.895 --> 02:58:57.076]  It's all human control.
[02:58:57.096 --> 02:58:58.036]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:58.336 --> 02:58:59.396]  Stay with us in 70 seconds.
[02:58:59.516 --> 02:59:08.480]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:59:08.560 --> 02:59:16.643]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:16.963 --> 02:59:21.664]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:21.824 --> 02:59:28.566]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:28.626 --> 02:59:35.708]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:35.788 --> 02:59:42.650]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:42.830 --> 02:59:47.194]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:47.314 --> 02:59:50.576]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:59:50.696 --> 02:59:56.821]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:59:57.001 --> 02:59:59.263]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:00:02.126 --> 03:00:04.748]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.287 --> 03:00:13.089]  Fixed bayonets.
[03:00:13.149 --> 03:00:14.011]  We're now in overdrive.
[03:00:14.091 --> 03:00:14.872]  A full hour of it.
[03:00:14.892 --> 03:00:16.175]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[03:00:20.123 --> 03:00:24.447]  And we are joined here in studio by David Knight and Rob Due.
[03:00:24.487 --> 03:00:27.829]  They're going to do an entire hour now of overdrive.
[03:00:27.849 --> 03:00:32.053]  They're going to start over slowly, methodically, Hal Jade Helm.
[03:00:32.473 --> 03:00:42.901]  We now find out as part of a large Pentagon, cybersecurity, FEMA, homeland security, mastering the human domain, Rural Affairs Council of the 10 regions of FEMA.
[03:00:43.121 --> 03:00:44.523]  You notice that's run by the Pentagon.
[03:00:45.203 --> 03:00:54.109]  This is the accelerated rollout ahead of economic collapse, and they know when one in ten has autism, when people are all dying of cancer, there's going to be civil unrest.
[03:00:54.489 --> 03:00:55.370]  People are going to say no.
[03:00:55.510 --> 03:00:56.711]  When nobody has money to prep.
[03:00:56.971 --> 03:01:00.033]  And the military is going to come and just take you away because you're a terrorist.
[03:01:01.014 --> 03:01:03.475]  Like they practiced in Fort Lauderdale just the other day.
[03:01:03.515 --> 03:01:05.396]  They were putting people in white vans and driving them off.
[03:01:06.077 --> 03:01:08.098]  But this is confirming.
[03:01:08.418 --> 03:01:11.620]  Starting with you about 20 minutes ago, and this will be the first video we put up on YouTube today.
[03:01:12.521 --> 03:01:13.923]  This is just the first salvo.
[03:01:14.905 --> 03:01:15.225]  Yes.
[03:01:17.448 --> 03:01:17.749]  Proof.
[03:01:17.989 --> 03:01:21.054]  Jade Helm is for domestic takeover.
[03:01:22.432 --> 03:01:28.298]  But, we need to add the proviso, not the takeover itself, the training for the takeover.
[03:01:28.338 --> 03:01:30.441]  It's an exercise in the takeover, is what it is.
[03:01:30.961 --> 03:01:32.463]  You were trying to talk for one to break, David.
[03:01:32.863 --> 03:01:36.167]  Tell us, preview what's coming up with you in the next hour with Rob Dew.
[03:01:36.487 --> 03:01:43.094]  Well, what we need to do, Alex, is we need to break down so that people really understand that this is, they just don't put these words up at random.
[03:01:43.114 --> 03:01:43.394]  I don't know.
[03:02:01.088 --> 03:02:05.129]  Mastering the human domain is a very specific term of art of the Department of Defense.
[03:02:05.409 --> 03:02:13.031]  So we're going to tell people what the human domain is, why it's significant about this mapping that we see, and of course that is just the tip of the iceberg.
[03:02:13.071 --> 03:02:16.292]  That is a very coarse map that people are angry about.
[03:02:16.312 --> 03:02:20.413]  It's like saying jiu-jitsu is an art form of martial arts or taekwondo.
[03:02:20.893 --> 03:02:21.953]  We have these terms.
[03:02:22.013 --> 03:02:22.793]  You go look them up.
[03:02:22.853 --> 03:02:25.494]  It's giant, huge meetings for domestic takeover.
[03:02:25.594 --> 03:02:26.514]  That's on the logo.
[03:02:26.874 --> 03:02:29.915]  Fits in with, quote, blending in, doing things that look illegal.
[03:02:30.676 --> 03:02:34.544]  I mean, that's why they're freaking out so bad is this is domestic.
[03:02:35.146 --> 03:02:36.469]  We gave them benefit of the doubt.
[03:02:36.509 --> 03:02:37.130]  We looked into it.
[03:02:37.150 --> 03:02:38.052]  They've been caught lying.
[03:02:39.013 --> 03:02:40.234]  It's a giant domestic takeover.
[03:02:40.254 --> 03:02:44.477]  This is folding in the intel they're getting from the surveillance state.
[03:02:44.517 --> 03:02:46.819]  This is folding it into these military operations.
[03:02:46.859 --> 03:02:48.100]  We don't get dragnet surveillance.
[03:02:48.740 --> 03:02:57.307]  Eventually, if we don't stop this, it is going to come to the point where they drag you out in the middle of the night, like we just saw in Fort Lauderdale, just as they've been authorized to do.
[03:02:57.327 --> 03:02:59.569]  That's what they're going to do when you don't vaccinate or you homeschool.
[03:02:59.589 --> 03:03:02.071]  They're already doing a low-intensity rounding folks up.
[03:03:02.811 --> 03:03:03.832]  It's going to intensify.
[03:03:03.872 --> 03:03:12.021]  Well, notice how that family, they put something out on Facebook, it went into the cloud, the cloud analyzed it and said, threat, threat matrix, we gotta send somebody out after them.
[03:03:12.441 --> 03:03:14.744]  The orders come into the CPS, they go take the kids away.
[03:03:15.164 --> 03:03:16.546]  That's how it's gonna work.
[03:03:17.166 --> 03:03:25.375]  And I'm about overtly fighting this and saying it's morally wrong, corrupt and evil, but people can also choose the other route, use Facebook and Twitter for disinformation.
[03:03:25.795 --> 03:03:27.417]  And I think it's patriotic duties.
[03:03:27.637 --> 03:03:28.138]  It's time.
[03:03:28.158 --> 03:03:29.199]  This is very sophisticated, folks.
[03:03:29.219 --> 03:03:30.020]  You've got to be careful.
[03:03:30.541 --> 03:03:32.823]  But it's time to start pumping it with disinfo.
[03:03:33.104 --> 03:03:37.629]  Not lies about media events and things, but your own homestead, your own house, what you're doing.
[03:03:38.250 --> 03:03:41.734]  I would say use it, but only use it to create a false image.
[03:03:42.695 --> 03:03:46.079]  The only way to defeat something like this is to pump it full of disinfo.
[03:03:46.601 --> 03:03:46.781]  Yeah.
[03:03:47.101 --> 03:03:49.082]  So then there's so much, it overloads the system.
[03:03:49.922 --> 03:03:51.362]  I mean, we're going to go through the whole thing.
[03:03:51.462 --> 03:03:58.785]  There's another aspect of this from that C-SPAN interview, which I kind of glossed over and I got called out on it by, why didn't you cover the robot section?
[03:03:58.805 --> 03:04:06.507]  There's a whole part where the guy talks about they have autonomous robots walking around as soldiers and civilians at that asymmetrical Fort AP Hill Center.
[03:04:06.687 --> 03:04:09.388]  I think that they're training for the robots to come after us.
[03:04:09.568 --> 03:04:10.208]  That's the headline.
[03:04:10.268 --> 03:04:12.189]  AP Hill training robots to fight.
[03:04:12.429 --> 03:04:13.089]  I mean, it's on.
[03:04:13.249 --> 03:04:17.250]  Listen, they're announcing China plans to get rid of, within five years, 90% of its workers.
[03:04:17.530 --> 03:04:18.351]  Yeah, with robots.
[03:04:18.471 --> 03:04:19.051]  And here's the thing.
[03:04:19.111 --> 03:04:20.091]  I mean, it's on, folks.
[03:04:20.191 --> 03:04:20.751]  It's on.
[03:04:20.992 --> 03:04:21.872]  I mean, it's their plan.
[03:04:23.853 --> 03:04:29.497]  Alex, when they ask him about Jade Helm, and he glances off and he nods, and he goes, I don't know anything about that.
[03:04:29.757 --> 03:04:31.699]  And now he's got to come up with something to talk about.
[03:04:31.719 --> 03:04:33.300]  They were doing that at Bastrop.
[03:04:33.380 --> 03:04:37.003]  He kind of unconsciously goes and is like, well, we've got autonomous robots.
[03:04:37.183 --> 03:04:40.385]  Yeah, so it's like, let's change the subject over here to something interesting.
[03:04:40.746 --> 03:04:42.647]  That's the thing that's first and foremost on his mind.
[03:04:42.667 --> 03:04:44.949]  They did that like a hundred times, Jakari was telling me.
[03:04:45.569 --> 03:04:50.012]  And begs that, to say anything, the Lieutenant Colonel would look back at the private corporation.
[03:04:50.312 --> 03:04:52.373]  They're the ones that give the money to the government to lobby.
[03:04:52.633 --> 03:04:53.994]  They're now in control of the military.
[03:04:54.515 --> 03:04:56.216]  So we're fighting for the future of the military.
[03:04:56.256 --> 03:04:58.157]  Hey, Chuck Norris is on our side.
[03:04:58.417 --> 03:04:59.218]  You guys are in trouble.
[03:04:59.238 --> 03:04:59.798]  We can't lose.
[03:05:01.219 --> 03:05:01.859]  We'll be back.
[03:05:02.039 --> 03:05:04.081]  The Republic is rising.
[03:05:04.281 --> 03:05:06.122]  The Sleeping Giant is rising.
[03:05:10.504 --> 03:05:11.545]  You pick up the receiver.
[03:05:11.745 --> 03:05:18.328]  With your heart racing and sweat dripping from your forehead, you finally muster the courage to dial the number to call into your favorite talk radio show.
[03:05:18.408 --> 03:05:21.870]  It rings once, twice, and then... Hello, it's GCN.
[03:05:22.010 --> 03:05:23.631]  What's your name and the state you're calling from?
[03:05:23.691 --> 03:05:27.053]  Surprised you got through, you squeak out... Jason from Minnesota.
[03:05:27.133 --> 03:05:27.613]  Please hold.
[03:05:27.733 --> 03:05:34.637]  As you patiently wait for your turn, you begin to daydream about being a famous talk radio host and what it would be like to have your own show.
[03:05:35.037 --> 03:05:36.699]  Jason from Minnesota, you're up!
[03:05:36.799 --> 03:05:40.605]  Millions of loyal listeners worldwide, waiting to call and talk to you.
[03:05:40.625 --> 03:05:41.706]  What color are you there?
[03:05:41.846 --> 03:05:44.410]  Cheering crowds surround you, calling out your name.
[03:05:44.570 --> 03:05:45.411]  Jason!
[03:05:45.751 --> 03:05:46.613]  Jason!
[03:05:47.013 --> 03:05:47.914]  Going once.
[03:05:48.195 --> 03:05:48.715]  Twice.
[03:05:48.956 --> 03:05:50.678]  Okay, we gotta move on to the next color.
[03:05:50.838 --> 03:05:51.579]  You blew it.
[03:05:51.639 --> 03:05:51.819]  Huh?
[03:05:51.860 --> 03:05:52.140]  Wait.

[03:06:18.859 --> 03:06:27.085]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:06:27.265 --> 03:06:31.928]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[03:06:46.016 --> 03:06:52.900]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[03:08:10.662 --> 03:08:11.583]  What's his name?
[03:08:11.623 --> 03:08:13.323]  This is an emergency transmission.
[03:08:13.604 --> 03:08:27.830]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA Region 6 in Occupy.
[03:08:34.480 --> 03:08:35.562]  There is a war.
[03:08:36.023 --> 03:08:37.044]  It's happening now.
[03:08:37.906 --> 03:08:39.708]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[03:08:40.269 --> 03:08:42.072]  The time to choose sides has come.
[03:08:42.854 --> 03:08:44.316]  We are the resistance.
[03:08:44.777 --> 03:08:46.540]  We are the Infowar.
[03:08:53.066 --> 03:08:55.189]  Welcome back to Overdrive with the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:55.269 --> 03:08:57.632]  I'm David Knight and joining me now is Rob Due.
[03:08:58.413 --> 03:09:01.216]  We want to give you the broader view.
[03:09:01.256 --> 03:09:08.265]  We want to explain to you what they mean by mastering the human domain when they have that on the Jade Helm logo.
[03:09:08.566 --> 03:09:11.589]  Let's pull that logo up and take a look at that as we explain this.
[03:09:12.190 --> 03:09:17.737]  Now, mastering the human domain is actually a term of art, just like unconventional warfare.
[03:09:17.798 --> 03:09:24.146]  Unconventional warfare means something very specific to the Department of Defense, and so does the human domain.
[03:09:24.787 --> 03:09:28.091]  When they're talking about that, they're talking about mapping you.
[03:09:28.852 --> 03:09:29.793]  You are the humans.
[03:09:29.933 --> 03:09:34.555]  Everything that they can find out about you, they're going to map on a geographical map.
[03:09:34.595 --> 03:09:42.859]  And I think it's very important that I... One of the reasons this has really picked up and caught the public's attention is because of the maps.
[03:09:42.959 --> 03:09:45.801]  But they don't understand the full extent of the maps.
[03:09:46.501 --> 03:09:49.863]  Now, James Clapper has been speaking at several of these
[03:09:51.109 --> 03:09:51.630]  These are
[03:10:12.239 --> 03:10:22.466]  Activity-based intel, human domain analytics, are arrows that will form the intellectual underpinning for how we conduct intelligence in the future.
[03:10:22.907 --> 03:10:28.491]  You have to understand that Jade Helm is as much an intel operation as it is a military operation.
[03:10:29.031 --> 03:10:36.954]  And when they use the military and they say, just salute the uniform, don't pay any attention to what's going on, they're using the military uniform to distract you.
[03:10:36.974 --> 03:10:41.156]  They're using it as a red herring so that you don't pay attention to what's going on with this.
[03:10:41.176 --> 03:10:54.662]  And of course, James Clapper was the guy who famously was asked by Ron Wyden if they were doing any dragnet surveillance, and he put his head down, he hid his eyes because he couldn't make direct eye contact, and he said, no, we're not doing that.
[03:10:55.222 --> 03:10:58.203]  We saw that he was, with the slides that were released from Ed Snowden.
[03:10:58.243 --> 03:11:00.184]  It's now common knowledge that he was lying.
[03:11:00.224 --> 03:11:08.227]  Of course, Michael Hayden, who was head of the NSA at the time, has subsequently spoken out at a Washington and Lee University conference to law students.
[03:11:08.267 --> 03:11:10.287]  He says, I blame Ron Wyden.
[03:11:11.008 --> 03:11:12.828]  He knew that we were doing dragnet surveillance.
[03:11:13.289 --> 03:11:19.131]  The staff, every one of the staff, every one of those senators on the Senate Intelligence Committee knew we were doing dragnet surveillance.
[03:11:19.551 --> 03:11:22.552]  And he asked that question to James Clapper, knowing that he couldn't answer it.
[03:11:23.473 --> 03:11:24.594]  Knowing that he would lie.
[03:11:24.654 --> 03:11:26.355]  So he put him into the position where he would lie.
[03:11:26.615 --> 03:11:31.919]  So I want to ask you just how much credibility people who have worked for the CIA and others really have on this.
[03:11:32.480 --> 03:11:39.525]  So I want to define, before we go to some of these clips that show what this is about, I want to define for you what the human domain is.
[03:11:40.265 --> 03:11:42.146]  Okay, there's four data categories in here.
[03:11:42.206 --> 03:11:46.930]  One of them is who you are, what you do, who you know, context, okay?
[03:11:47.230 --> 03:11:47.710]  Who you are.
[03:11:47.730 --> 03:11:54.035]  This is analysts collecting information about your name, your address, your gender, your biometrics, your Facebook page.
[03:11:54.415 --> 03:11:56.176]  This is what we've been talking about for a very long time.
[03:11:56.417 --> 03:11:57.838]  This is where this is all coming together.
[03:11:58.078 --> 03:11:59.659]  This is domestic, exactly.
[03:11:59.839 --> 03:12:03.962]  It's domestic, it is police-based, it is intel-based, it's
[03:12:04.062 --> 03:12:08.404]  N.S.A., Homeland Security, attending these conferences, and it's also the military.
[03:12:08.904 --> 03:12:09.985]  Next thing, what you do.
[03:12:10.485 --> 03:12:15.747]  Collected information will include your travel, your communications, your financial transactions.
[03:12:15.767 --> 03:12:17.288]  They want to see all the money that you spend.
[03:12:17.308 --> 03:12:18.889]  That's why we have to have this war on cash.
[03:12:19.469 --> 03:12:22.891]  Your movement of physical access, assets.
[03:12:22.931 --> 03:12:25.572]  That's right, they're going to track you by your cell phone, they're going to track you by your car.
[03:12:25.872 --> 03:12:26.492]  Who you are.
[03:12:26.772 --> 03:12:28.013]  This is relational information.
[03:12:28.453 --> 03:12:34.198]  Your family, your friends, your associates, your organizations, your community involvement, and then here's the broad thing, the context.
[03:12:34.798 --> 03:12:40.263]  Contextual data will include demographics, your politics, your religion, etc.
[03:12:40.523 --> 03:12:44.066]  So do you want the government tracking all of this?
[03:12:44.126 --> 03:12:45.987]  Do you want the surveillance state that we have?
[03:12:46.027 --> 03:12:56.215]  Do you want the police and the military mapping you out on a geographical basis because that is what this human domain analytics is about?
[03:12:56.475 --> 03:12:56.836]  That's what
[03:12:57.356 --> 03:12:59.477]  Activity-based intel is about.
[03:12:59.857 --> 03:13:01.919]  That is what geo-intel is about.
[03:13:01.959 --> 03:13:05.040]  And they put all that together and they call it multi-intel.
[03:13:05.080 --> 03:13:06.941]  Because they're looking at everything about you.
[03:13:06.961 --> 03:13:09.643]  It is full spectrum, total awareness, tyranny.
[03:13:09.803 --> 03:13:10.603]  And let me add this.
[03:13:10.963 --> 03:13:15.946]  If this was for our safety and for our security, like they like to say it is, then why are they creating the terror groups?
[03:13:16.006 --> 03:13:17.767]  Why are they funding the terrorists out there?
[03:13:17.887 --> 03:13:20.669]  Why are they making dropships to ISIS?
[03:13:22.209 --> 03:13:24.831]  And now ISIS is here, supposedly, in the United States.
[03:13:24.851 --> 03:13:25.871]  They have ISIS agents here.
[03:13:26.992 --> 03:13:31.957]  You know, if this is supposedly for our safety and security, then why are they funding the terrorists?
[03:13:32.257 --> 03:13:33.858]  Because they need to have both sides of it.
[03:13:33.898 --> 03:13:34.379]  Exactly.
[03:13:34.939 --> 03:13:36.180]  Just like the drug war.
[03:13:36.320 --> 03:13:45.969]  We just had Freeway Ricky Ross, and we know that they were running the crack cocaine at the same time that they were fighting the war on drugs.
[03:13:46.029 --> 03:13:47.971]  So it's like, I'm from the government, I'm here to help you do both.
[03:13:48.231 --> 03:13:51.633]  So, let's go back, let's play the C-SPAN clip again.
[03:13:51.773 --> 03:13:58.257]  If people are just joining us now, this is Colonel John Potosik, head of the Asymmetrical Warfare Group at Fort E.P.
[03:13:58.297 --> 03:14:02.400]  Hill, where you guys went about a year ago, got detained by this colonel.
[03:14:02.540 --> 03:14:03.380]  Yes.
[03:14:04.001 --> 03:14:06.522]  And after you'd gotten permission to go on the base and check it out.
[03:14:06.562 --> 03:14:08.844]  And you even, they let you into the Asymmetrical Warfare Group.
[03:14:08.864 --> 03:14:09.544]  Yes, they let us in.
[03:14:09.844 --> 03:14:10.265]  And you know what?
[03:14:10.805 --> 03:14:16.250]  When we talk about this being for the United States, we stood at the corner of 1st and Main.
[03:14:16.771 --> 03:14:19.613]  And I took Joe Biggs' picture there at the corner of 1st and Main.
[03:14:20.154 --> 03:14:22.155]  Everything about this was thoroughly American.
[03:14:22.195 --> 03:14:24.217]  The street signs, the traffic lights were working.
[03:14:24.598 --> 03:14:29.362]  The only thing that was there that could be remotely considered not to be American was the mosque.
[03:14:29.402 --> 03:14:31.744]  But they had an American church right across the street from it.
[03:14:32.044 --> 03:14:34.267]  Stained glass, pews, the whole bit.
[03:14:34.887 --> 03:14:47.937]  This is training the military as well as the police, and of course, as we talk about this, uh, mastering the human domain, we will see that it is a fusion of the intelligence community, the law enforcement community, and the military.
[03:14:48.337 --> 03:14:49.658]  That is what should concern you.
[03:14:50.279 --> 03:14:55.823]  And we need to pull this back, and we need to say, this is not going to be the mission of our government.
[03:14:55.863 --> 03:15:01.287]  This is not going to be the mission of the military or law enforcement, and we don't want this kind of intelligence being kept on the American people.
[03:15:01.307 --> 03:15:01.828]  We're sick of it.
[03:15:02.068 --> 03:15:02.288]  Right.
[03:15:02.588 --> 03:15:03.409]  Now let's go to that clip.
[03:15:04.209 --> 03:15:04.810]  Good morning, Colonel.
[03:15:05.190 --> 03:15:14.264]  I wanted to alert our citizens and to get an explanation if we could for an exciting military training called Jade Helm 15, which is all over the internet.
[03:15:14.304 --> 03:15:19.331]  I guess it involves 10 states and there's going to be civilians participating in towns like
[03:15:19.631 --> 03:15:21.292]  Thank you very much.
[03:15:37.112 --> 03:15:41.417]  Unfortunately, it's not something that I'm familiar with, so I can't really explain that.
[03:15:41.977 --> 03:15:52.708]  But I do know that those type of things are things that we do here, where we get our soldiers the opportunity to work within an environment where there are civilians and soldiers.
[03:15:52.768 --> 03:15:58.694]  As a matter of fact, one of the things I can talk about is that, unfortunately, I just don't know about that particular exercise.
[03:16:01.257 --> 03:16:06.879]  The Army's plan for a multi-state training exercise this summer called Jade Helm 15.
[03:16:07.420 --> 03:16:14.543]  While the military says it's just training soldiers for the realities of war, critics say the Army is preparing for modern-day martial law.
[03:16:14.583 --> 03:16:16.164]  Some are calling it a Texas takeover.
[03:16:16.224 --> 03:16:29.231]  What's happening is between July and September, a bunch of Green Berets, Navy SEALs, and special ops from the Air Force and Marines are conducting some realistic training exercises across the Southwest, including 17 different Texas cities.
[03:16:29.491 --> 03:16:32.092]  Again, I'm sorry, I'm just not familiar with that exercise.
[03:16:32.612 --> 03:16:33.693]  I see nothing!
[03:16:33.973 --> 03:16:35.073]  I was not here!
[03:16:35.353 --> 03:16:37.934]  I did not even get up this morning!
[03:16:37.994 --> 03:16:46.277]  So we have Colonel Schultz, head of the Asymmetrical Warfare Group, knows nothing about the biggest asymmetrical warfare exercise going on in the United States.
[03:16:46.417 --> 03:16:53.480]  When Matt Drudge picked up our story on this, and he posted our story, and he also posted a link to the document up on Scribd,
[03:16:53.960 --> 03:16:55.001]  That was their response.
[03:16:55.401 --> 03:16:56.582]  I don't know anything about this.
[03:16:56.642 --> 03:16:57.463]  I can't respond to it.
[03:16:57.503 --> 03:16:58.183]  I can't see it.
[03:16:58.303 --> 03:16:59.504]  I don't, you know, I see nothing.
[03:16:59.564 --> 03:17:00.185]  I know nothing.
[03:17:00.565 --> 03:17:01.766]  That was their initial response.
[03:17:01.806 --> 03:17:06.789]  The same response as we saw here with this colonel at the asymmetric warfare group.
[03:17:06.910 --> 03:17:14.955]  And asymmetric warfare and special forces and the unconventional warfare, that is all part of, they are intricately intermeshed with each other.
[03:17:15.015 --> 03:17:18.058]  He knows exactly what's going on with this, but he gives us the same
[03:17:18.678 --> 03:17:20.459]  Lying, denial, it's very transparent.
[03:17:20.519 --> 03:17:26.722]  And that's over an hour of, well it's about an hour, 55 minutes of this interview with this colonel, people calling in.
[03:17:27.022 --> 03:17:28.863]  Not one person agreed with what they were doing.
[03:17:29.163 --> 03:17:30.824]  They all saw the BS behind it.
[03:17:30.844 --> 03:17:37.087]  They said, look, you're training to go into our cities, you're training to take out our American citizens, you're training for gun confiscation just like Katrina.
[03:17:37.447 --> 03:17:40.128]  And he denied it, he said, well no, this is for training all over the world.
[03:17:40.749 --> 03:17:43.190]  And we're all over the world, I'm sorry, we're part of the world.
[03:17:43.470 --> 03:17:46.954]  Oh yeah, well that was everybody's concern about the NDAA when they passed that.
[03:17:46.974 --> 03:17:54.162]  They said we're going to allow indefinite detention by the military without trial and rendition and everybody said, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[03:17:54.783 --> 03:17:59.929]  We understand that you have given yourself supposedly authorization for use of military force.
[03:18:00.009 --> 03:18:00.429]  Worldwide.
[03:18:00.469 --> 03:18:01.670]  That includes the United States.
[03:18:01.910 --> 03:18:05.652]  That's why everybody is concerned, and rightfully so, about the NDAA.
[03:18:06.252 --> 03:18:10.514]  And, you can see, if you look at that Fort Lauderdale clip, I mean, that is training.
[03:18:10.554 --> 03:18:16.717]  That's what that looks like when they come in the middle of the night, march people out into white vans, and take them away.
[03:18:17.117 --> 03:18:18.677]  That is the NDAA.
[03:18:18.737 --> 03:18:25.821]  It's been a couple of years, and so people have kind of calmed down, kind of gotten used to the NDAA, but they are training to do precisely that.
[03:18:26.741 --> 03:18:29.164]  I don't care if they're going to do that abroad.
[03:18:29.184 --> 03:18:32.207]  Well, I do care because I think that's a very bad foreign policy.
[03:18:32.247 --> 03:18:33.228]  It's blown back on us.
[03:18:33.889 --> 03:18:34.529]  It has failed.
[03:18:34.630 --> 03:18:41.437]  Nevertheless, as Madison said, the means of defense against foreign danger have always been the tools of tyranny at home.
[03:18:41.717 --> 03:18:42.958]  And now they're practicing it.
[03:18:43.199 --> 03:18:46.742]  They're practicing it in our streets, in our cities.
[03:18:47.483 --> 03:18:49.604]  What does it take for people to wake up and see this?
[03:18:49.644 --> 03:18:54.845]  Well, they're about to start using robots because the colonel also lets out... Let's go to this second clip.
[03:18:55.326 --> 03:19:02.868]  And he's talking about working with autonomous robots, how they dress them up in clothes, either soldiers or civilians, and they see how the soldiers react to it.
[03:19:03.777 --> 03:19:04.678]  That is, that's freaking scary.
[03:19:34.177 --> 03:19:34.857]  That's a great thing.
[03:19:35.658 --> 03:19:43.760]  Now that's kind of scary, and that's really kind of breaking news that people are not... They've got robots that walk around that look enough like humans that they're dressing them up in, uh, yeah.
[03:19:43.900 --> 03:19:45.300]  He said autonomous robots.
[03:19:45.340 --> 03:19:47.301]  That means robots with artificial intelligence.
[03:19:47.801 --> 03:19:48.281]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:19:48.301 --> 03:19:48.721]  That's crazy.
[03:19:48.801 --> 03:19:50.342]  It's totally... Yeah, we've got to go to break.
[03:19:50.362 --> 03:19:50.982]  We're going to come back.
[03:19:51.002 --> 03:19:52.382]  We're staying here in Overdrive.
[03:19:52.442 --> 03:19:53.483]  David Knight and Rob Dues.
[03:19:53.563 --> 03:19:54.123]  Stay with us.
[03:20:09.881 --> 03:20:12.462]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[03:20:12.602 --> 03:20:16.603]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[03:20:16.903 --> 03:20:18.123]  Silverlungs.com.

[03:20:37.588 --> 03:20:39.088]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[03:20:39.568 --> 03:20:45.352]  So I say to Mark at lunch, look, you know, I keep hearing from the government that, you know, they're worried someday ISIS may get here.
[03:20:45.652 --> 03:20:51.135]  Then I go, duh, Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting, ISIS is already here.
[03:20:51.515 --> 03:20:53.537]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me.
[03:20:53.677 --> 03:20:57.839]  If they don't know ISIS is here already, they got no clue, I'm taking care of myself.
[03:20:58.059 --> 03:21:02.942]  Guns80.com, AR-15 kits, 30 shot magazines, great prices.

[03:23:08.503 --> 03:23:08.944]  Gold.
[03:23:09.304 --> 03:23:10.566]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[03:23:10.826 --> 03:23:12.408]  From the Romans through the Renaissance.
[03:23:12.688 --> 03:23:16.912]  From the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[03:23:17.092 --> 03:23:20.935]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[03:23:21.276 --> 03:23:23.157]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[03:23:23.217 --> 03:23:25.499]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[03:23:25.639 --> 03:23:33.166]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[03:23:33.226 --> 03:23:34.007]  I don't know.
[03:23:48.523 --> 03:23:54.128]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[03:23:54.448 --> 03:23:57.050]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:23:59.272 --> 03:24:03.355]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[03:24:03.536 --> 03:24:04.556]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[03:24:34.409 --> 03:24:38.453]  I don't think people understand how epic this is, the information that we're covering right now.
[03:24:38.874 --> 03:24:44.640]  This is showing you, we're explaining how Jade Helm is applying to you, how it's for domestic operations.
[03:24:44.680 --> 03:24:47.082]  They keep saying it's for worldwide training.
[03:24:47.283 --> 03:24:49.024]  That's why they're training here in the United States.
[03:24:49.084 --> 03:24:49.645]  It's for you.
[03:24:50.226 --> 03:24:50.426]  Okay?
[03:24:50.666 --> 03:24:55.110]  We're part of the world, but it is very much focused on the things that they have domestically.
[03:24:55.150 --> 03:24:58.993]  This ties together the dragnet surveillance, the surveillance of all the social media.
[03:24:59.233 --> 03:25:03.457]  This ties together the military as well, and that's a very troubling aspect of it.
[03:25:03.737 --> 03:25:04.978]  But it is domestic.
[03:25:05.058 --> 03:25:05.559]  We have the U.S.
[03:25:05.579 --> 03:25:06.780]  Geological Service there.
[03:25:07.040 --> 03:25:07.761]  They are mapping.
[03:25:08.061 --> 03:25:13.745]  Humans on to the geological map, and they're looking at you at the individual level.
[03:25:13.885 --> 03:25:14.885]  Every aspect of you.
[03:25:15.146 --> 03:25:17.527]  This is where the surveillance pays off for them.
[03:25:17.567 --> 03:25:20.649]  This is the geo-int, the human domain.
[03:25:20.669 --> 03:25:25.412]  And when they say mastering the human domain, it's a very specific term of art from the military.
[03:25:25.452 --> 03:25:26.533]  And this has been an evolution.
[03:25:26.573 --> 03:25:30.277]  It started off as we're going to get real detailed maps of everything using satellite imagery.
[03:25:30.577 --> 03:25:31.918]  Well now they have these detailed maps.
[03:25:32.139 --> 03:25:34.241]  Now they know who lives at what address.
[03:25:34.581 --> 03:25:38.405]  And now they're tying that in with your Facebook account, with your Twitter account, with your YouTube videos.
[03:25:38.685 --> 03:25:47.354]  So they're measuring your political beliefs and they can go up and down and go, well he's kind of for us, this guy's against us, this guy's pulling the party line, this guy isn't, we need to put him on a watch list.
[03:25:47.614 --> 03:25:49.616]  And they're using all this for future operations.
[03:25:49.716 --> 03:25:54.780]  And Jade Helm, what that is doing is getting the troops used to practicing here in the U.S.
[03:25:55.101 --> 03:25:57.943]  and getting local officials to work with those troops.
[03:25:58.223 --> 03:25:58.964]  That's what that is.
[03:25:59.344 --> 03:26:02.867]  And so, there might be three or four more Jade Helms before something really happens.
[03:26:03.128 --> 03:26:04.989]  But they're building up these relationships.
[03:26:05.069 --> 03:26:07.311]  They're building an infrastructure of tyranny.
[03:26:08.192 --> 03:26:10.714]  There's a legal infrastructure, things like the NDAA.
[03:26:11.095 --> 03:26:15.038]  There is a technical infrastructure, things like the capabilities to do dragnet surveillance.
[03:26:15.498 --> 03:26:19.241]  And then, of course, there's going to be a military and a law enforcement infrastructure.
[03:26:19.581 --> 03:26:20.662]  Those are merging.
[03:26:20.863 --> 03:26:21.923]  That's what you have to understand.
[03:26:21.963 --> 03:26:32.112]  When they talk about the human domain, when they talk about geointelligence, mapping this all together, they're multi-int, taking all of this multiple intelligence sources, focusing it
[03:26:32.532 --> 03:26:34.093]  Down to the micro level.
[03:26:34.113 --> 03:26:37.474]  They're very concerned, they say, in these presentations.
[03:26:37.494 --> 03:26:43.076]  They're very concerned about one guy with a computer and a video camera because he can have worldwide impact.
[03:26:43.276 --> 03:26:45.717]  That's why they're looking at you as an individual.
[03:26:45.937 --> 03:26:46.377]  Exactly.
[03:26:46.637 --> 03:26:47.958]  And now, I want to go to this first clip.
[03:26:47.978 --> 03:26:49.958]  This is Lieutenant Colonel Al DiLenardo.
[03:26:49.978 --> 03:26:54.120]  This is from the Master of the Human Domain 2010 GEOINT Conference.
[03:26:54.560 --> 03:26:56.241]  And he used to run a fusion cell for U.S.
[03:26:56.281 --> 03:26:57.021]  Special Forces.
[03:26:57.541 --> 03:26:59.443]  Okay, so this is not some ordinary guy.
[03:26:59.683 --> 03:27:04.988]  When they show him in his intro picture, he's sitting there like a robot, like, I'm scanning the terrain for enemies.
[03:27:05.428 --> 03:27:07.490]  But it's Mastering the Human Domain Conference.
[03:27:07.650 --> 03:27:07.870]  Right.
[03:27:07.930 --> 03:27:12.194]  Okay, just like that's the bottom of the Jade Helm logo, Mastering the Human Domain.
[03:27:12.394 --> 03:27:13.596]  So we're going to go to this first clip.
[03:27:14.016 --> 03:27:15.297]  This is clip one with the Colonel.
[03:27:15.657 --> 03:27:18.140]  And this is how they gather data using Facebook and Twitter.
[03:27:18.420 --> 03:27:20.041]  And basically, they want to predict the future.
[03:27:20.061 --> 03:27:20.502]  So here it is.
[03:27:21.414 --> 03:27:25.837]  So I really had the privilege of running more of a multi-innovation cell.
[03:27:26.457 --> 03:27:42.989]  The cell's objectives were to use as much non-traditional data from an Intel standpoint, that means a lot of open source data, to go out and do sense making of data so that not only your analysts but
[03:27:43.709 --> 03:27:50.413]  Your machine learning, your algorithms you could build would ultimately get to a predictive analysis.
[03:27:51.014 --> 03:27:54.576]  It's very hard to do, especially if you don't have all the data.
[03:27:54.736 --> 03:28:00.079]  Basically, old data is good data, new data is good data, and all data is good.
[03:28:00.099 --> 03:28:01.580]  I want it all.
[03:28:01.660 --> 03:28:08.325]  In the context of how I view human terrain, somewhat controversial in some aspects, is
[03:28:10.646 --> 03:28:25.097]  It's sociocultural information and it becomes, when used in intelligence purposes or for sense making for operations, when you bring it to the GEOINT, and I don't mean to be coy in saying that, when you bring GEOINT to it,
[03:28:27.078 --> 03:28:27.318]  I think
[03:28:43.383 --> 03:28:48.470]  ...as unclassified examples there, of different layers that you would make.
[03:28:49.090 --> 03:28:59.863]  It's that open source, combined with the classified information, combined with the now, the old and the now, that begins to give you the layers you can make to make sense of what's really going on.
[03:29:01.072 --> 03:29:06.815]  I don't know if you noticed that at the end, but we showed the Jade Helm logo and then they're at the Mastering the Human Domain Conference of 2010.
[03:29:07.195 --> 03:29:09.836]  So just think of how far they've come in five years.
[03:29:10.196 --> 03:29:10.376]  Yeah.
[03:29:10.576 --> 03:29:12.738]  Right there they were saying, well, you know, we're trying to get this data.
[03:29:12.758 --> 03:29:13.338]  It's a little hard.
[03:29:13.638 --> 03:29:15.519]  Now it's all being seamlessly done.
[03:29:15.899 --> 03:29:17.520]  It's all done through cloud computing.
[03:29:17.880 --> 03:29:18.980]  Everything is an open book.
[03:29:19.020 --> 03:29:21.802]  Everybody's lives, people are putting their lives out there on the Internet.
[03:29:22.122 --> 03:29:23.723]  You saw what happened with the family in Kentucky.
[03:29:23.763 --> 03:29:24.823]  They put a picture there.
[03:29:24.883 --> 03:29:26.144]  Hey, here's our beautiful family.
[03:29:27.045 --> 03:29:27.345]  Boom!
[03:29:27.465 --> 03:29:29.946]  Instantly, the arm of the law comes down on them.
[03:29:29.986 --> 03:29:32.687]  Because they're not necessarily looking for bad guys, as they say.
[03:29:32.727 --> 03:29:34.307]  They're looking for anomalies.
[03:29:34.487 --> 03:29:38.328]  And then once you get under their microscope, they'll decide if they like you or not.
[03:29:38.568 --> 03:29:38.908]  Okay?
[03:29:38.948 --> 03:29:40.729]  This is not about solving a crime.
[03:29:40.749 --> 03:29:47.051]  This is about just scanning the environment, seeing what we're going to... What we could come up against on the battlefield.
[03:29:47.211 --> 03:29:47.511]  Exactly.
[03:29:47.651 --> 03:29:49.371]  And the battlefield is in the United States.
[03:29:50.151 --> 03:29:53.912]  It all ties together with Rumsfeld's unknown unknowness.
[03:29:54.233 --> 03:29:55.333]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[03:29:58.904 --> 03:30:01.907]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.828 --> 03:30:05.670]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.275 --> 03:30:13.117]  Why use dial-up when you can use broadband?
[03:30:13.878 --> 03:30:16.921]  Why travel with this when you can use this?
[03:30:17.782 --> 03:30:23.345]  And why would anyone use colloidal or ionic silver when you can use supernatural silver?
[03:30:23.766 --> 03:30:30.549]  Supernatural silver is state-of-the-art, and it's been clinically proven to be several hundred times more effective than those other silvers.
[03:30:30.990 --> 03:30:36.553]  It's powerful enough to protect you and your family from the threat of deadly viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[03:30:36.933 --> 03:30:40.175]  But it's so safe that it can be used internally or topically.
[03:30:40.655 --> 03:30:44.798]  And you'll never again deal with the nasty side effects of harsh drugs or antibiotics.
[03:30:45.338 --> 03:30:55.565]  Hundreds of scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals, and research institutions have all shown Supernatural Silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against invading pathogens.
[03:30:55.886 --> 03:30:58.808]  Supernatural Silver is a must-have for your arsenal.

[03:32:09.338 --> 03:32:12.843]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[03:32:13.584 --> 03:32:14.085]  It's true.
[03:32:14.205 --> 03:32:18.151]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[03:32:18.351 --> 03:32:20.214]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[03:32:20.754 --> 03:32:25.221]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[03:32:25.521 --> 03:32:38.126]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[03:32:38.386 --> 03:32:41.927]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[03:32:42.188 --> 03:32:44.488]  The gold standard in water purification.
[03:32:44.849 --> 03:32:48.890]  And our filters last for years at less than two cents per gallon.
[03:32:49.150 --> 03:32:53.452]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[03:32:53.672 --> 03:32:55.274]  Get your Big Berkey today.

[03:32:57.797 --> 03:32:58.418]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:32:58.538 --> 03:32:59.920]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[03:32:59.960 --> 03:33:00.981]  For the love of clean water.
[03:33:16.400 --> 03:33:26.889]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial commons.
[03:33:27.309 --> 03:33:32.653]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[03:33:33.114 --> 03:33:39.158]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[03:33:39.279 --> 03:33:41.661]  It is a big idea.
[03:33:41.821 --> 03:33:42.081]  A new
[03:33:46.323 --> 03:33:48.948]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[03:33:48.968 --> 03:33:50.090]  It's just pancakes.
[03:33:50.150 --> 03:33:54.579]  Either you're with us, or you're with the terrorists.
[03:34:10.506 --> 03:34:16.059]  I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[03:34:20.553 --> 03:34:21.554]  Guns will be taken.
[03:34:21.574 --> 03:34:22.914]  No one will be able to be armed.
[03:34:22.954 --> 03:34:23.795]  We're going to take all guns.
[03:34:24.015 --> 03:34:28.957]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[03:34:29.017 --> 03:34:30.498]  Global governance at last.
[03:34:30.578 --> 03:34:33.219]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[03:34:33.259 --> 03:34:36.721]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[03:34:36.921 --> 03:34:42.803]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[03:34:43.144 --> 03:34:47.846]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:34:51.435 --> 03:34:52.376]  I'm Rob Due.
[03:34:52.476 --> 03:34:54.318]  I've got David Knight riding shotgun.
[03:34:54.338 --> 03:35:04.347]  We're co-hosting today, this last hour, this last hour of Overdrive, to bring you some really epic information, showing you how they've been talking about mastering the human domain for years now.
[03:35:04.407 --> 03:35:12.314]  So when they put that on the Jade Helm logo and they show the map, how it's color-coded with good guys and bad guys and hostile and friendlies,
[03:35:12.955 --> 03:35:14.376]  They've been talking about this for a long time.
[03:35:14.416 --> 03:35:21.760]  This is not just a one-off exercise where they're just going to, you know, put some troops into the woods and, you know, run around, you know, for a couple months.
[03:35:21.800 --> 03:35:22.761]  It's not going to be like that.
[03:35:22.781 --> 03:35:29.845]  But first, before we get into the rest of this presentation, I want to remind you that your support is what keeps us going here on the air.
[03:35:29.865 --> 03:35:33.888]  And one way to support us is by getting a ProPure water filter, and that's a great way to support yourself.
[03:35:34.548 --> 03:35:42.012]  I don't know if you own a water filter or if you've ever filtered your water, but if you taste the difference between filtered water and tap water, it is unbelievable.
[03:35:42.032 --> 03:35:44.874]  You will never go back to tap water because it tastes like dirt.
[03:35:45.234 --> 03:35:47.135]  It tastes like chlorinated pool water.
[03:35:47.516 --> 03:35:48.356]  It's disgusting.
[03:35:48.436 --> 03:35:50.177]  And I own one of these ProPure systems.
[03:35:50.197 --> 03:35:50.958]  I own the biggest one.
[03:35:50.978 --> 03:35:53.799]  I got four filters in it and it's emptied every day.
[03:35:53.879 --> 03:35:56.361]  My kids drink that water and it takes out the fluoride.
[03:35:56.804 --> 03:36:03.386]  And if you're not even in the city where they're fluoridating the water, you still have to be concerned about glyphosate making its way into the aquifer.
[03:36:03.506 --> 03:36:04.206]  And it's everywhere.
[03:36:04.226 --> 03:36:05.627]  They're saying glyphosate's everywhere.
[03:36:05.727 --> 03:36:06.287]  It's a hormone.
[03:36:06.307 --> 03:36:07.247]  Filters that out as well.
[03:36:07.267 --> 03:36:09.228]  And you never know what they're going to come down the line with next.
[03:36:09.508 --> 03:36:11.488]  Hey, I take bottled water, and we have bottled water left over.
[03:36:11.548 --> 03:36:15.770]  I dump it in there because I just want to get out whatever's left, what's ever getting into the plastic.
[03:36:15.790 --> 03:36:18.010]  So we have a deal running now, Water 20.
[03:36:18.270 --> 03:36:21.251]  It'll get you 20% off any of the Pro-Pure stuff.
[03:36:21.271 --> 03:36:22.912]  We have a whole range.
[03:36:22.932 --> 03:36:23.432]  Just through this weekend.
[03:36:23.772 --> 03:36:24.853]  Yeah, it's just for this weekend.
[03:36:25.133 --> 03:36:25.994]  We've got the Big King.
[03:36:26.034 --> 03:36:30.917]  They even have a little camper version that's got one little filter in it that you can take camping with you.
[03:36:30.937 --> 03:36:31.898]  It's totally portable.
[03:36:32.338 --> 03:36:33.879]  Put that in your bug out bag, even.
[03:36:34.199 --> 03:36:38.963]  I mean, just so many different ways that you can prepare for something that may happen.
[03:36:39.323 --> 03:36:39.823]  You never know.
[03:36:39.863 --> 03:36:43.646]  You never know when you're in an earthquake zone or a volcano erupts.
[03:36:43.666 --> 03:36:44.466]  You know, there's volcanoes.
[03:36:44.526 --> 03:36:46.288]  Or just take it with you when you're going to a restaurant.
[03:36:46.328 --> 03:36:47.829]  You know, they're going to give you some fluoridated water.
[03:36:47.849 --> 03:36:48.309]  There you go.
[03:36:48.609 --> 03:36:51.431]  Pull it out there, show them, hey, you know, this is what I do with your water.
[03:36:51.471 --> 03:36:52.052]  I filter it.
[03:36:52.572 --> 03:36:53.972]  Water 20 is the code.
[03:36:54.112 --> 03:36:54.953]  It supports us.
[03:36:55.013 --> 03:36:56.833]  It's a win-win-win for everybody out there.
[03:36:57.594 --> 03:36:58.634]  So let's get back into this.
[03:36:58.734 --> 03:37:06.916]  I got another clip of this colonel talking about how they use the color coding system to classify friendlies and hostiles in a numbering system.
[03:37:07.216 --> 03:37:12.338]  And then I showed the Jade Helm map right there that has the different colors that he talks about.
[03:37:13.038 --> 03:37:18.299]  I think that map is the key thing, because just like the NSA spying, this went on for a very long time.
[03:37:18.359 --> 03:37:31.462]  We had whistleblowers, William Benny, about a half dozen whistleblowers from the NSA said, they're violating the Constitution, they're collecting all your data, that's a violation, not only the Constitution, but the FISA Act, and nobody paying attention to them.
[03:37:31.882 --> 03:37:32.982]  Then we got the documents.
[03:37:33.122 --> 03:37:36.063]  People saw the Snowden slides, and I think that's the thing.
[03:37:36.443 --> 03:37:37.963]  People look at this and say, wait a minute.
[03:37:38.183 --> 03:37:41.765]  You're labeling places as hostile, and they said, oh, it's just an exercise, don't worry about it.
[03:37:42.125 --> 03:37:49.510]  You need to understand when they say mastering the human domain, this is about mapping everything they can collect on you geographically.
[03:37:49.870 --> 03:37:51.951]  So that is just the tip of the iceberg.
[03:37:51.991 --> 03:37:55.433]  That is just a big, that's just only part of it.
[03:37:55.673 --> 03:37:58.235]  The detail is if you look at GeoInt.
[03:37:58.355 --> 03:37:59.315]  Let's go back to the clip.
[03:38:00.649 --> 03:38:03.732]  So we start out with a layered group-level analysis.
[03:38:03.752 --> 03:38:10.797]  This is much like traditional all-source analysis, intelligence preparation on the battlefield type of things, OPE these days.
[03:38:11.137 --> 03:38:17.563]  What we do is we focus it on groups, we focus it on ethnicities, religious groups.
[03:38:18.383 --> 03:38:22.788]  And we can start to map out in color code the different locations.
[03:38:23.248 --> 03:38:29.475]  And we might apply some basic routing of transportation nodes and routes in that.
[03:38:29.495 --> 03:38:30.796]  Now it will become a base layer.
[03:38:31.236 --> 03:38:35.841]  The second step we start doing is support level characterizations.
[03:38:36.222 --> 03:38:39.745]  The support level characterizations, we generally will make a scale.
[03:38:41.206 --> 03:38:43.288]  And we'll say plus four to minus four.
[03:38:43.628 --> 03:38:46.270]  We'll take current ops activity in a particular area.
[03:38:46.830 --> 03:38:59.960]  We'll base it in the case of, you pick a place, and try and neck it down into, you know, a plus four being bad a location, a minus four being a good location.
[03:39:00.200 --> 03:39:05.584]  And we start to characterize the location in a color-coding, simple way, green, yellow, and red.
[03:39:06.284 --> 03:39:09.227]  And then we start layering that on top of the tribal aspects.
[03:39:09.847 --> 03:39:26.114]  And we start to see very distinct patterns of, you know, what tribe X or what group X supports or doesn't support, you know, hostile activities in their area, vice areas that are, say, green and clear of problems.
[03:39:26.134 --> 03:39:27.334]  This is a very all-source centric approach.
[03:39:31.816 --> 03:39:47.052]  But often, up until maybe the last five or ten years in the current fight, we have not really done a very good job of making the cultural aspects really relevant in everyday intelligence analysis.
[03:39:47.212 --> 03:39:51.036]  The next step you would take is to dive into each of those areas.
[03:39:51.957 --> 03:39:52.057]  Yeah.
[03:40:08.058 --> 03:40:09.439]  Where are the key locations?
[03:40:09.579 --> 03:40:23.287]  Doing things like cross-surface analysis to understand time, distance, travel within that group, and understand what's normal activity for the particular ethnic group or location of individuals within that region.
[03:40:23.607 --> 03:40:35.815]  And so you now know what's normal, and then you can follow the activity with various collection methods and sensors to get to what is not normal and what needs to be adjusted over time.
[03:40:36.454 --> 03:40:44.336]  So he's talking about it from their standpoint of this is how we do it in Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia and other places.
[03:40:44.977 --> 03:40:49.178]  But as we're going to get to, we're going to show you they're bringing all this back home.
[03:40:49.238 --> 03:40:51.039]  They're working with civilian institutions.
[03:40:51.059 --> 03:40:52.459]  They're working with law enforcement.
[03:40:52.779 --> 03:40:54.240]  And we've got more clips coming.
[03:40:54.540 --> 03:40:56.181]  So this is just the tip of the iceberg.
[03:40:56.221 --> 03:41:02.564]  We're trying to lay out a case here as if you were in court and you were presenting evidence going, look, Jade Helm is for the American people.
[03:41:02.824 --> 03:41:04.265]  Jade Helm is for the American people.
[03:41:04.525 --> 03:41:05.786]  Jade Helm is for the American people.
[03:41:05.806 --> 03:41:06.846]  That was our opening argument.
[03:41:06.886 --> 03:41:10.228]  And now we're going to show you how it is being used for the American people.
[03:41:10.328 --> 03:41:13.850]  The means of defense abroad have always become the tools of tyranny at home.
[03:41:14.230 --> 03:41:15.291]  That is a lesson of history.
[03:41:15.491 --> 03:41:17.433]  That is what James Madison, one of our founders, said.
[03:41:17.753 --> 03:41:22.417]  Listen, when he's talking about the activity that people are doing, this is activity-based intelligence.
[03:41:22.437 --> 03:41:23.718]  This is a key part of this.
[03:41:24.098 --> 03:41:30.323]  Activity-based intelligence, ABI, joins up with human domain analytics, which is HDA, okay?
[03:41:30.483 --> 03:41:38.329]  Together, what they're doing is they're focusing on the activity and the transactions associated with a person, a population, or an area of interest.
[03:41:38.369 --> 03:41:41.972]  Now, Rob, I want to say, the key ABI enablers, they say,
[03:41:42.412 --> 03:41:45.295]  This is a quote from the organization U.S.
[03:41:45.335 --> 03:41:47.076]  Geospatial Intelligence Foundation.
[03:41:47.096 --> 03:41:50.599]  This is kind of a trade organization for GEOINT.
[03:41:51.160 --> 03:41:56.824]  They say that, first, there are searchable databases that we need to get activity-based intelligence data.
[03:41:57.285 --> 03:42:03.730]  These must include the human domain data, which is frequently sequestered behind law enforcement or privacy rules.
[03:42:04.491 --> 03:42:12.698]  Policy must also extend to permitting the exploitation of the vast amount of information that is in these unclassified public areas.
[03:42:12.718 --> 03:42:17.702]  In other words, we need to change the laws, we need to change the policies so that we can legally get to that.
[03:42:17.723 --> 03:42:18.884]  Of course, they're going to do it anyway.
[03:42:18.924 --> 03:42:22.887]  Whether or not they have the legal authority to do it, we know that the NSA... They always do it after the fact.
[03:42:22.967 --> 03:42:24.789]  That's right, but they're going to try to cover themselves.
[03:42:25.090 --> 03:42:34.441]  That's why when you see these documents that were put out two, three, five years ago, they've been creating that infrastructure, that legal infrastructure, they've been creating that technical infrastructure.
[03:42:34.741 --> 03:42:39.707]  Now they are physically training the boots on the ground to put all this stuff together, see how it works out.
[03:42:39.747 --> 03:42:42.531]  That's why you see them picking up people in Fort Lauderdale in the middle of the night.
[03:42:42.791 --> 03:42:44.613]  Marching them into white vans, driving them off.
[03:42:44.833 --> 03:42:54.921]  Now they also say this, the rapidly approaching cloud architectures used by industry and government lend themselves well to storage and processing of immense quantities of information.
[03:42:55.181 --> 03:43:00.586]  Enabling the data in the cloud requires all data have associated metadata that is tagged.
[03:43:00.626 --> 03:43:02.467]  Okay, what's been the big fight with the NSA?
[03:43:03.248 --> 03:43:04.449]  Hey, it's just metadata.
[03:43:04.709 --> 03:43:06.029]  We can't get anything out of the metadata.
[03:43:06.049 --> 03:43:10.611]  Now, William Benny came on here and said, metadata, I can find out everything about you with metadata.
[03:43:10.832 --> 03:43:22.537]  That's what they're saying with mastering the human domain is getting your metadata tags that is searchable and accessible by the analysts who can get this stuff off of the cloud, off of social media.
[03:43:22.677 --> 03:43:25.198]  And that's on the technological standpoint.
[03:43:25.238 --> 03:43:28.760]  Now, I got an article here, Brigade Homeland Tour starts October 1st.
[03:43:28.780 --> 03:43:30.080]  If you guys could go to this shot here.
[03:43:31.000 --> 03:43:41.165]  The 3rd Infantry Division's 1st Brigade Combat Group has spent 35 of the last 60 months in Iraq patrolling in full battle rattle, helping to restore essential services and escorting supply convoys.
[03:43:41.445 --> 03:43:43.826]  Now they're training for the same mission with a twist at home.
[03:43:44.486 --> 03:43:48.030]  Beginning October 12th for 12 months, they will be under the day-to-day command of U.S.
[03:43:48.150 --> 03:43:52.134]  Army North, the Army Service Component of Northern Command.
[03:43:52.635 --> 03:43:55.038]  So they're coming home to work with NORTHCOM.
[03:43:55.338 --> 03:43:56.860]  And they say at least there's going to be 750,000 troops.
[03:43:56.880 --> 03:43:57.300]  This is back in 2008.
[03:44:01.064 --> 03:44:04.045]  So, boots on the ground training here in the United States.
[03:44:04.465 --> 03:44:10.567]  Now, in 2010, we see that they're grabbing this data to create battlefield models and all over the world, essentially.
[03:44:10.587 --> 03:44:12.348]  Including the United States.
[03:44:12.508 --> 03:44:14.228]  Oh, definitely including the United States.
[03:44:14.468 --> 03:44:16.709]  And now we're going to go to this third clip from this conference.
[03:44:16.729 --> 03:44:22.951]  This is Doug Weinstein, the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense, DOD, Department of Defense for Intelligence.
[03:44:23.251 --> 03:44:26.113]  And he talks about why it's so important that we have all this information.
[03:44:26.133 --> 03:44:31.018]  He even makes a reference to James Clapper saying why he thinks it's so important that we have all this information.
[03:44:31.058 --> 03:44:32.799]  Let's roll the clip.
[03:44:34.020 --> 03:44:40.365]  As Chris mentioned earlier, I'm a policy analyst in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, Sociocultural Analysis Program.
[03:44:41.426 --> 03:44:49.453]  The program was established less than just two years ago to provide support for and oversight of defense intelligence, sociocultural analysis,
[03:44:50.923 --> 03:44:57.208]  Uh, capabilities to apply and integrate the social sciences in addressing defense intelligence requirements.
[03:44:58.029 --> 03:45:08.016]  This period of low intensity conflict, irregular warfare, and counterinsurgency operations has greatly increased the number of requirements related to sociocultural analysis.
[03:45:09.057 --> 03:45:10.198]  From data collection models...
[03:45:12.059 --> 03:45:21.470]  To data collection itself, to taxonomies, to analytic methods, to processing, exploitation and dissemination.
[03:45:22.191 --> 03:45:27.998]  These requirements reflect the growing needs of our combatant commands, our combat support agencies,
[03:45:29.304 --> 03:45:35.946]  The services, our national agencies, our coalition partners, and academia as well.
[03:45:36.266 --> 03:45:49.009]  On just Tuesday, Director Clapper emphasized the importance of partnerships and information sharing and information integration within the intelligence community and between our second and third party partners.
[03:45:50.629 --> 03:45:54.990]  Enable the combatant command sociocultural analysis cells, which exists at
[03:45:56.548 --> 03:46:14.995]  Five of the six geographic commands in addition to SOCOM, so that's AFRICOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM, PACOM, and SOUTHCOM, to mature their analytic capabilities with respect to the requirements of their commander and the Joint Intelligence and Operations Center that they exist within.
[03:46:16.380 --> 03:46:21.484]  It's like watching paint dry, but he's basically describing how... There's one of your robots.
[03:46:21.504 --> 03:46:24.507]  Yeah, I think it's one of the autonomous robots right there.
[03:46:24.647 --> 03:46:27.709]  They wheel him out and let him disseminate the propaganda.
[03:46:27.969 --> 03:46:28.750]  Still very dangerous.
[03:46:28.910 --> 03:46:29.150]  Right.
[03:46:29.470 --> 03:46:30.852]  So now we go a year later.
[03:46:30.872 --> 03:46:39.979]  We already played this video in the last hour, but I want to play it again so we have all this contained in one giant capsule of truth that we can launch out of the airlock here in a second at the end of this hour.
[03:46:40.599 --> 03:46:43.681]  So this is from the opening video of their 2011 conference.
[03:46:43.721 --> 03:46:49.064]  So a year has gone by since we've heard from these guys how they want to collect data, how they want to classify people.
[03:46:49.444 --> 03:46:50.665]  Now they're really going in.
[03:46:50.685 --> 03:46:53.226]  2011 is when we started seeing more iPhones out there.
[03:46:53.266 --> 03:47:03.392]  They can really grab all this data from people, all this metadata, the phone calls, where you travel, and turn it into a living document that can be accessed through the cloud in real time.
[03:47:03.452 --> 03:47:04.233]  So here it is.
[03:47:05.307 --> 03:47:10.231]  The threats that we face don't recognize boundaries.
[03:47:11.352 --> 03:47:16.876]  Whether those are physical boundaries, or organizational boundaries, or agency boundaries.
[03:47:17.717 --> 03:47:24.842]  And every time we're inhibited in our response to those threats by our own boundaries, we've lessened our impact.
[03:47:25.003 --> 03:47:26.143]  Just take away all restrictions on us.
[03:47:26.163 --> 03:47:31.608]  We lessen our impact, we lessen our services to those decision makers, and we ultimately affect our national security in a negative way.
[03:47:31.988 --> 03:47:38.814]  The consequence to the nation if we don't integrate intelligence, I believe, is simply that we will miss things.
[03:47:38.874 --> 03:47:47.581]  We won't deliver the best possible solution set to our mission partners, whether that's the policy maker, the war fighter, or the first responder.
[03:47:48.241 --> 03:47:59.490]  This type of warfare today, the types of threats that we face, require rapid assimilation of information, rapid understanding of the situation where it is a rapid decision.
[03:48:00.311 --> 03:48:07.574]  So, without integrated intelligence, it's like fighting with both hands tied behind your back, blindfold over your eyes.
[03:48:08.715 --> 03:48:15.098]  It's uncertainty, it's poor decisions, it's delayed decisions, it's loss of opportunity, it's loss of momentum.
[03:48:15.518 --> 03:48:26.781]  So the way you are most likely to recognize the content, the substance, the early warning, the value of information is that you integrate it in the most comprehensive way.
[03:48:27.082 --> 03:48:44.727]  And that means that you understand sensors and capabilities, you understand collection, you understand the question, you understand the needs, potential threats, and you're putting that information together in a way that the sum is significantly larger, more valuable, more useful.
[03:48:45.507 --> 03:48:50.292]  Alright, and now I want to play this Clapper clip.
[03:48:50.312 --> 03:48:58.280]  This is back in 2007 where he's talking about how important drones are to get the big wide aerial view, but we need something to get the straw tip.
[03:48:58.460 --> 03:49:02.003]  And we're going quick because we're running out of time here, so I want to go to this clip right now.
[03:49:02.544 --> 03:49:03.525]  And this is James Clapper.
[03:49:04.546 --> 03:49:10.533]  Full motion video, UAVs, and all that sort of thing, which they can't get enough of out there.
[03:49:10.934 --> 03:49:19.785]  And we're going through a recent upheaval in the Pentagon in response to General Petraeus' request that, you know, we've got to get more out here.
[03:49:20.819 --> 03:49:31.466]  I think it's a good thing to bear in mind, though, that they're great for the thick and finish piece, not so great for the fine piece.
[03:49:32.787 --> 03:49:49.017]  And so what we really need, and I think General Cartwright I think spoke to this early when he was here, is this combination of wide area surveillance, which you can then use to cue this sort of soda straw focused collection of the UAVs.
[03:49:50.516 --> 03:49:56.404]  That in turn, I think, is a commercial for the proliferation.
[03:49:56.625 --> 03:50:02.232]  The more sensors, the more platforms, the more phenomenologies that we have up there, the better it is.
[03:50:03.373 --> 03:50:10.115]  And then you got yesterday, FBI admits to flying secret surveillance flights over Baltimore for days as the city rioted over the death of Freddie Gray.
[03:50:10.395 --> 03:50:21.978]  So they're using the drone, and in this case they're flying planes, but it probably had drones up there too, getting the wide-angle surveillance, and then they're using Twitter and Facebook to get those little in-depth, the personal
[03:50:22.338 --> 03:50:26.379]  Well, of course, the problem with all that is, is that these are not surgical strikes in reality.
[03:50:26.879 --> 03:50:36.322]  Even though they're supposed to have this omniscient, omnipotent intelligence, we see that there have been thousands of people who are innocent who have been killed in these drone strikes.
[03:50:36.342 --> 03:50:36.902]  A lot of children.
[03:50:36.922 --> 03:50:40.303]  Many, many more times the number of supposedly guilty individuals and
[03:50:40.623 --> 03:50:42.744]  How do we determine that these individuals are guilty?
[03:50:43.165 --> 03:50:48.508]  That's the thing that concerns us when this is being done domestically because we have lost our due process.
[03:50:48.768 --> 03:50:51.590]  We've lost the privacy about all this information.
[03:50:51.890 --> 03:50:53.271]  They are putting this all together.
[03:50:53.291 --> 03:50:56.613]  We're going to talk about the predictive aspects of this as well.
[03:50:56.633 --> 03:51:07.279]  We're going to show you more clips of what mastering the human domain really means and why you should be concerned about the intel aspects of this so-called military operation Jade Helm.
[03:51:07.319 --> 03:51:07.880]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:09.972 --> 03:51:15.637]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader, MyPatriotSupply.

[03:53:57.274 --> 03:53:58.075]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:53:58.576 --> 03:54:00.238]  Say goodbye to the cable guy.
[03:54:00.438 --> 03:54:01.960]  Cut costs and get more.
[03:54:01.980 --> 03:54:02.541]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:54:02.561 --> 03:54:02.822]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:54:18.195 --> 03:54:32.371]  The recognition of the importance of the human domain and that sophisticated understanding of all those things you said, the tribal history, language, culture, it's so significant.
[03:54:32.691 --> 03:54:34.333]  One of the programs we've put into place
[03:54:35.109 --> 03:54:36.209]  You know, just think about this.
[03:54:36.269 --> 03:54:36.890]  Most of the U.S.
[03:54:36.950 --> 03:54:37.810]  Army is coming home.
[03:54:38.010 --> 03:54:39.390]  I mean, for various reasons.
[03:54:39.470 --> 03:54:40.971]  It said we're not forward deployed.
[03:54:41.391 --> 03:54:42.531]  Not going to be easy to study.
[03:54:42.992 --> 03:54:50.394]  This program we have of regionally aligned forces is an intellectual commitment by our Army that says you're a professional soldier.
[03:54:50.974 --> 03:54:52.335]  You're likely to fight here.
[03:54:52.636 --> 03:54:56.059]  You better start that understanding of the operational environment.
[03:54:56.399 --> 03:55:08.850]  Whether you take no intel at rest, whether your entire ace or your intel analytical section is focused on supporting a specific problem set down range, studying that down to individual level fidelity.
[03:55:09.390 --> 03:55:18.455]  The opportunity, the preparation of putting leaders on the ground, putting great young leaders on the ground in that environment, growing up, experiencing it, being immersed in it.
[03:55:18.495 --> 03:55:34.743]  But I think identifying this lesson that some did it well, some did not do it well, and then building those appropriate mechanisms, the reasonably aligned forces and the constructs that we're developing in terms of that intellectual commitment
[03:55:35.844 --> 03:55:39.105]  To mastering that is absolutely essential.
[03:55:39.326 --> 03:55:48.951]  We have lots of people who have grown up over the last 10 years who understand working with NGOs, with governmental organizations, with interagency partners.
[03:55:50.052 --> 03:55:50.952]  So what are we going to do now?
[03:55:52.493 --> 03:55:53.474]  Are we going to continue that?
[03:55:53.814 --> 03:55:56.375]  Are we going to continue to develop these relationships?
[03:55:56.395 --> 03:55:59.037]  Are we going to continue to understand each other, how to operate together?
[03:56:00.218 --> 03:56:01.198]  That's a challenge we have.
[03:56:01.278 --> 03:56:07.481]  I'm willing to assign military officers and NCOs to these organizations.
[03:56:08.641 --> 03:56:11.182]  I'm willing to do training with these organizations.
[03:56:12.182 --> 03:56:14.603]  The challenge is going to be, is it going to be reciprocal?
[03:56:15.223 --> 03:56:19.325]  And that's what we have to work on because that's why I don't have to relearn this again.
[03:56:21.125 --> 03:56:22.326]  As you said, we had some problems.
[03:56:22.346 --> 03:56:24.486]  Not everybody got it, but we have a lot of people who did.
[03:56:24.506 --> 03:56:29.188]  And we have a lot of young officers and NCOs who did this at a very low level.
[03:56:30.134 --> 03:56:38.609]  And so it's incumbent on us to make sure that we don't lose this and that we capture this and we continue to do it in a peacetime environment.
[03:56:39.190 --> 03:56:43.257]  When we do our exercises now and at the training centers, we are including a civil
[03:56:44.176 --> 03:56:45.377]  Military piece of it.
[03:56:45.677 --> 03:56:46.598]  A civil piece of it.
[03:56:46.618 --> 03:56:50.721]  The issue is how we continue to support that as we move forward and can we continue to get support.
[03:56:50.741 --> 03:56:51.201]  There you go.
[03:56:51.221 --> 03:56:52.842]  Civilian and military working together.
[03:56:52.882 --> 03:56:57.866]  That was from the Association of the United States Army panel discussing the importance of the human domain.
[03:56:57.946 --> 03:57:03.530]  They were just discussing... They're merging together and again from the very beginning this has been the NSA, this has been the U.S.
[03:57:03.550 --> 03:57:11.536]  Geological Service, this has been law enforcement, it's been military working to put together all this information in terms of the dragnet surveillance.
[03:57:11.596 --> 03:57:13.077]  Working with Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[03:57:13.337 --> 03:57:17.100]  You know, when you had the Lieutenant Colonel who came here and he said, well, you know, the cultures are different.
[03:57:17.120 --> 03:57:18.722]  People are like, what is he talking about?
[03:57:19.122 --> 03:57:23.305]  He's parroting back what they're talking about with this human domain analytics.
[03:57:23.806 --> 03:57:26.468]  And it's important to understand, too, the predictive nature of it.
[03:57:26.488 --> 03:57:30.611]  They're talking about this in the same terms as pre-crime for law enforcement.
[03:57:30.892 --> 03:57:32.093]  That's where they're drawing this from.
[03:57:32.393 --> 03:57:34.335]  They said, we're going to look at this environment.
[03:57:34.355 --> 03:57:34.575]  Of course,
[03:57:34.935 --> 03:57:38.997]  We're not saying there's any bad guys, or we don't know who the bad guys are, we're just collecting data on everybody.
[03:57:39.337 --> 03:57:43.399]  Then we will analyze it, we'll see what pops up, and then we'll get a close inspection on them.
[03:57:43.439 --> 03:57:48.541]  And then, if you are either permissive or hostile when they contact you, they'll know what to do.
[03:57:48.861 --> 03:57:53.203]  And now that we've destroyed the economy, this is going to be one of the one areas that you can get a job at.
[03:57:53.283 --> 03:57:59.786]  Predictive programming, predictive crime, working in these areas, going to the Doomsday Disney World and working there.
[03:57:59.806 --> 03:58:02.748]  I mean, that's, we're just basically going to
[03:58:03.408 --> 03:58:06.450]  Be creating janitors to go around and clean up this mess that we've created.
[03:58:06.470 --> 03:58:24.224]  Well again, this predictive nature, whether it's law enforcement, especially if it's the military coming into an area, that's what should really concern us, this pre-crime thing where they analyze the data and then because you stick out in some way, now you're treated as if you've already had due process, as if you've already been found guilty of a crime.
[03:58:24.604 --> 03:58:31.069]  And we see how these SWAT teams breaking down the doors of innocent people, people who have small amounts of drugs and non-violent
[03:58:31.269 --> 03:58:31.689]  Exactly.
[03:58:31.970 --> 03:58:36.814]  This should be very concerning when we see this kind of use of this dragnet surveillance.
[03:58:37.294 --> 03:58:38.135]  Well, that's it for today.
[03:58:38.195 --> 03:58:40.516]  Thank you for joining us, Rob Due and David Knight.
