[00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:09.104]  What I'm not going to do is just wait.
[00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:21.449]  I think it's fair to say that I've shown a lot of patience, tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible, and I'm going to keep on doing so.
[00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:22.209]  But in the meantime,
[00:00:23.788 --> 00:00:28.012]  Let's figure out what we can do lawfully through executive action.
[00:00:28.372 --> 00:00:31.194]  Obama's Executive Amnesty 2015.
[00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:35.998]  Texas Congressman Lamar Smith dubbed it the worst prison break in history.
[00:00:36.218 --> 00:00:45.325]  Two years ago, ICE officials released into the United States more than 36,000 illegals with 88,000 convictions under their belt.
[00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:50.949]  200 convictions of homicide, 400 sexual assault convictions, and around 16,000 drunk or drugged
[00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:54.512]  Driving convictions.
[00:00:54.993 --> 00:01:04.501]  Thanks to FOIA requests by Judicial Watch, we know that the Department of Homeland Security told 166,000 more convicted illegals to deport themselves.
[00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:06.143]  Of course, none of them left.
[00:01:06.543 --> 00:01:15.692]  And now we have a grand total of 195,900 convicted illegals wandering around the United States, all thanks to President Obama.
[00:01:16.192 --> 00:01:20.234]  Just last week, an illegal raped his girlfriend's 10-year-old daughter in Louisiana.
[00:01:20.594 --> 00:01:23.375]  Another illegal raped a 10-year-old Alabama girl.
[00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:30.999]  In 2014, there were 418 child rapes by illegal aliens in one month alone in North Carolina.
[00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:42.004]  The ACLU recently demanded that religious groups provide abortions for the upwards of 80% of women raped and impregnated as they clamored for Obama's promise of amnesty.
[00:01:42.324 --> 00:01:58.155]  The federal government has wasted $41 million taxpayer dollars deporting and importing illegals on half-full charter planes at $8,149 per flight hour on average, whether the flights are full or not.
[00:01:58.435 --> 00:01:59.316]  According to U.S.
[00:01:59.336 --> 00:02:03.999]  Census figures, illegals will account for 51 million of the U.S.
[00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.962]  population in just 8 years, a historic 82% of the population.
[00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:11.704]  SCARCITY OF JOBS FOR U.S.
[00:02:11.724 --> 00:02:18.386]  CITIZENS AND MAJOR CULTURAL CHANGES ASIDE, BY 2023, ONE IN SEVEN U.S.
[00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:23.088]  RESIDENTS COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE A CRIMINAL PAST OVERLOOKED BY THE U.S.
[00:02:23.128 --> 00:02:23.548]  GOVERNMENT.
[00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:43.983]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:47.324]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:02:47.344 --> 00:02:49.064]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:55.326]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:02:55.446 --> 00:03:01.328]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:05.252]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:03:05.452 --> 00:03:08.375]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:03:08.535 --> 00:03:16.524]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:03:16.784 --> 00:03:18.845]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:03:18.905 --> 00:03:19.946]  It's a war against the truth.
