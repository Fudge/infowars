[00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:21.246]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.306 --> 00:00:25.789]  I'm your host Rob Dew and today's date is November 12, 2015 and here's a look at what's coming up.
[00:00:29.432 --> 00:00:37.037]  Tonight, a tech giant says that the next generation will live inside a cashless society.
[00:00:38.098 --> 00:00:42.101]  Then, how veterans are still not getting the care that they need.
[00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:46.324]  And a look into race relations on college campuses.
[00:00:47.184 --> 00:00:47.845]  That's next.
[00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:57.549]  And it is just a mindless power grab by the feminist commanding the young throngs of chip-on-the-shoulder youth.
[00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.377]  We've done an analysis of it, all Ford Foundation Soros manipulated, and it's just pathetic to see.
[00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:08.926]  These people will not get jobs anywhere.
[00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:13.169]  I don't care if it's a young white woman, a young white guy, black woman, whatever.
[00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:14.130]  I'm looking at these people.
[00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.311]  They're not getting educations.
[00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:18.953]  They're not learning how to make connections and get jobs.
[00:01:19.914 --> 00:01:22.436]  Just so much of business is just interpersonal skill.
[00:01:22.456 --> 00:01:24.197]  Even Bloomberg had an article on that a month ago.
[00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:31.594]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:33.176]  You can't survive without it.
[00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:34.277]  But where do you get it?
[00:01:34.557 --> 00:01:40.322]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:01:40.543 --> 00:01:46.268]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:01:46.468 --> 00:02:03.329]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.850]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.391]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:08.452]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:09.332]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:09.632 --> 00:02:11.453]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:33.706]  Welcome back.
[00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:38.149]  Well, the PC mob mentality culture has come to a full head.
[00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:43.574]  In fact, they're sending out white privilege surveys to public schools and St.
[00:02:43.634 --> 00:02:44.915]  Paul Public School District.
[00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:47.577]  Let me just read you the questions on this survey.
[00:02:47.637 --> 00:02:49.458]  This is just the idiocy that's going on.
[00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:57.965]  If I should need to move, I can be pretty sure of hassle-free renting or purchasing in an area of which I would want to live.
[00:02:58.971 --> 00:03:04.394]  Oh, okay, so nothing's going to go wrong with you, because if something does go wrong with you, it must be racist.
[00:03:05.715 --> 00:03:11.859]  I can turn on the television or open the front page of a newspaper and see people of my race widely and positively represented.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.700]  Okay.
[00:03:14.601 --> 00:03:19.764]  I can go to most supermarkets and find staple foods which fit my racial ethnic traditions.
[00:03:20.244 --> 00:03:23.266]  I can go to a hairdresser's shop and find someone who can cut my hair.
[00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:34.931]  I can swear, dress in second-hand clothes, and not answer letters without having people attribute these choices to bad morals, the poverty, or illiteracy of my race.
[00:03:36.652 --> 00:03:38.212]  I mean, who comes up with this stuff?
[00:03:38.653 --> 00:03:46.036]  I can basically do whatever I want, and if anybody tries to call me out on it, well then they're a racist, and they're exhibiting white privilege.
[00:03:46.336 --> 00:03:47.837]  I mean, that's basically what this is saying.
[00:03:48.968 --> 00:03:52.212]  And so this is obviously leaking into the universities.
[00:03:52.572 --> 00:03:55.455]  What's been going on in Mizzou is just totally off the wall.
[00:03:55.475 --> 00:03:59.800]  They've canceled classes over these KKK threats, which we'll get into that in a second.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.603]  But here's the article from Blake Neff at a Daily Caller.
[00:04:02.903 --> 00:04:04.825]  Mizzou protesters segregate by race.
[00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:08.928]  White students asked to leave a black-only healing space.
[00:04:09.488 --> 00:04:19.994]  In an ironic development, to say the least, protesters at the University of Missouri segregated themselves by race Wednesday night, having white students leave a gathering in order to create a black-only healing space.
[00:04:20.714 --> 00:04:23.716]  There it is, a black-only healing space, and you can see some of the tweets.
[00:04:24.276 --> 00:04:30.140]  It's not totally surprising that concerned student 1950 would attempt to create segregated areas as part of its protest movement.
[00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:44.328]  After protesters attacked reporters who were attempting to cover the drama Monday, a group attacked a white media, quote, for failing to understand the importance and respect of black spaces, even though that tweet has been deleted.
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:54.529]  And so what we have essentially, you can actually see this type of behavior mimicked in insects where a wasp actually comes in and sprays ants.
[00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:00.355]  All these ants are working together, but it sprays them with this kind of mind control spray and makes them all fight each other.
[00:05:00.576 --> 00:05:01.717]  Here's Leanne McAdoo with more.
[00:05:03.134 --> 00:05:11.116]  Well, as if things couldn't get any crazier on campuses across the nation, the protests going on at Mizzou have now segregated themselves by race.
[00:05:11.516 --> 00:05:18.297]  Supporters of the group Concerned Students 1950 assembled at the Student Center after a planned march got rained out.
[00:05:18.637 --> 00:05:23.398]  Then, according to an activist who was on scene, whites were asked to leave.
[00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:30.400]  The crowd was divided up into seven groups for blacks or at least non-whites, and then the white people were told
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.621]  To leave and to go upstairs.
[00:05:32.661 --> 00:05:34.141]  They were put into another group.
[00:05:34.382 --> 00:05:42.885]  Now, you'll recall that divide and conquer and deliberate segregation is a favored move of the Soros-backed Black Lives Matter movement.
[00:05:43.345 --> 00:05:54.590]  Rules for whites were introduced during protests last winter, and one of Black Lives Matter's main activists was at Mizzou to ensure the blacks-only healing space was set up.
[00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:00.773]  Deliberate segregation is approved by the KKK, mind you, but it's also approved by the establishment.
[00:06:01.073 --> 00:06:06.996]  Divide and conquer ensures that people will never actually work together to effect real change.
[00:06:07.336 --> 00:06:13.719]  Now, we should all be on the same side, but keeping us apart actually nullifies the power of the people.
[00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:20.602]  Now, here we have people who think they're actually fighting the establishment, when in reality, you are the establishment.
[00:06:20.862 --> 00:06:25.146]  They will call for you to be fired for challenging their subjective feelings.
[00:06:25.667 --> 00:06:32.234]  They will literally call for police to arrest you, even if you are a journalist just trying to document their protest.
[00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:40.874]  Campus police sent out an email to students telling them to report any hurtful speech.
[00:06:41.395 --> 00:06:46.378]  Even though, as this email points out, hateful or hurtful speech is not a crime.
[00:06:46.758 --> 00:06:49.099]  So they're not actually going to do any arresting of anybody.
[00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.062]  They're just going to be policing thought and chilling free speech on campus.
[00:06:53.462 --> 00:06:55.743]  George Orwell would be so proud.
[00:06:56.143 --> 00:07:00.066]  So, progressives, they champion diversity, but not diversity of thought.
[00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:03.768]  But where have we seen such student tactics before?
[00:07:03.788 --> 00:07:13.433]  Now, the Red Guards were a mass paramilitary social movement that started out as campus thought police, attacking anyone that didn't hold the correct views.
[00:07:13.793 --> 00:07:18.796]  Chairman Mao is a favorite of campus crazies everywhere who think they're fighting the establishment.
[00:07:19.096 --> 00:07:22.578]  He is also the world's most politically correct mass murderer.
[00:07:23.058 --> 00:07:25.639]  Mao was a rabid believer in political correctness.
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:32.223]  In fact, he wrote the book, not to have a correct political point of view is like having no soul.
[00:07:32.723 --> 00:07:39.987]  Those are the words of the Chinese communist leader who has the extreme distinction of having caused more deaths than any human in history.
[00:07:40.007 --> 00:07:41.868]  50 to 70 million.
[00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:44.390]  That's more than Stalin and Hitler combined.
[00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.191]  Let's simplify this a little bit.
[00:07:46.551 --> 00:07:48.513]  Humans and ants have a lot in common.
[00:07:48.753 --> 00:07:56.558]  They're both very loyal, they have hard work ethic, and they also have a strong sense of community that allows them to build really complex societies.
[00:07:57.059 --> 00:08:01.742]  Humans and ants also have enemies that seek to destroy their way of life.
[00:08:02.122 --> 00:08:07.327]  The Ectomon wasp is a particularly dangerous foe for the type of warfare that it uses.
[00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:12.511]  Upon entering the colony, the ants will immediately attack it in order to protect their queen.
[00:08:12.952 --> 00:08:18.116]  But the wasp emits a pheromone that causes the ants to start attacking each other.
[00:08:18.657 --> 00:08:25.963]  With the ants fighting amongst themselves, the wasp moves further along, laying its parasitic egg which will destroy the colony.
[00:08:26.323 --> 00:08:28.826]  And the ants are totally hopeless to defend against it.
[00:08:29.246 --> 00:08:31.847]  So ask yourself, are you fighting the real enemy?
[00:08:32.227 --> 00:08:44.754]  Or have you been soaked in socialist lefty lunacy, which seeks to destroy not only institutions of higher learning, but the entire colony, by attacking the very principles this country was founded upon?
[00:08:45.554 --> 00:08:46.595]  A new world order.
[00:08:47.335 --> 00:08:53.258]  A world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations.
[00:08:54.741 --> 00:09:00.763]  So it's not just the politically correct fervor that is attacking the students and all this PC, mind control mindset.
[00:09:01.283 --> 00:09:03.483]  It's actually going after some of the faculty too.
[00:09:04.223 --> 00:09:13.726]  Right now, there is a, one of the beloved professors there, Dale Brigham, has resigned following a week of, this week of outrage over his refusal to cancel an exam on campus.
[00:09:14.306 --> 00:09:17.749]  Dr. Dale Brigham was considered most of the beloved professors at the University of Missouri.
[00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.554]  He has resigned after refusing to cancel an exam for students who claim to feel unsafe.
[00:09:22.574 --> 00:09:25.417]  This is out of the Gateway Pundit by Jim Hoft.
[00:09:26.017 --> 00:09:31.122]  Dr. Brigham was sharply criticized in the media for requiring students to attend class to take his exam.
[00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:32.303]  Salon ran a story.
[00:09:32.744 --> 00:09:33.324]  Here's the headline.
[00:09:33.725 --> 00:09:38.529]  White Missouri professor shames black students for heeding violent threats.
[00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:39.430]  Thank you.
[00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:57.827]  And she's not even, she doesn't even go to the university.
[00:09:58.327 --> 00:10:03.468]  She just is from Houston, Texas, just jumping in on the racial hysteria that's being stirred up.
[00:10:04.088 --> 00:10:05.088]  And what were the threats?
[00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:11.710]  Well, there were threats that KKK was on campus intimidating people and that the National Guard was being called out.
[00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.430]  In fact, I want to get to that story.
[00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:21.272]  But first, let's hear from what, you know, we had a little bit of common sense coming out of the Americans, Young Americans for Liberty.
[00:10:21.292 --> 00:10:22.312]  This is what they had to say.
[00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:31.068]  I'm Ian Paris, and I'm president of Young Americans for Liberty at the University of Missouri.
[00:10:31.348 --> 00:10:35.554]  We're out here with a free speech wall protesting the literal speech police on campus.
[00:10:35.794 --> 00:10:39.539]  We think it's important that students understand that their right to speech is unlimited.
[00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:43.885]  That the fact that they might have an idea that's offensive to some doesn't mean that it has to be silenced.
[00:10:44.125 --> 00:10:49.248]  In fact, I think it's important that students express themselves, regardless of their opinions, even if I disagree with their opinions.
[00:10:49.508 --> 00:10:57.293]  Because that's the only way that we can achieve a marketplace of ideas, and those ideas can come to fruition, should they actually satisfy the needs of the majority.
[00:10:57.633 --> 00:11:02.516]  And so I think it's important that people understand that bad speech be countered with more good speech.
[00:11:02.556 --> 00:11:08.500]  And I'm not saying that people's opinions are bad, but rather that if you disagree with something, it's important that you maintain a message of
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.120]  I think?
[00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:31.817]  Criticize it and express yourself in a positive way to have a constructive dialogue rather than a destructive dialogue that takes away from the conversation.
[00:11:32.078 --> 00:11:37.664]  It's important that you express yourself positively and that you fight hatred not with more hatred but with love and acceptance.
[00:11:37.984 --> 00:11:42.629]  And I think that's what some students on campus don't understand and certainly what the administration doesn't seem to understand.
[00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:47.474]  I don't think Tim Wolf was responsible for the actions of a few racist individuals on campus.
[00:11:47.834 --> 00:11:53.239]  I think Tim Wolf was made into a scapegoat in order to be a target of all the hatred that some students were feeling.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.004]  And while their pain may be real, I don't think that they expressed it in necessarily a constructive manner.
[00:11:58.344 --> 00:12:00.806]  I think that they need to express it in a way that
[00:12:01.527 --> 00:12:01.747]  I think?
[00:12:21.937 --> 00:12:22.117]  I don't
[00:12:36.974 --> 00:12:37.434]  I don't think so.
[00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:58.086]  Today, when I look around on my campus, I see that an innocent man lost his job.
[00:12:58.226 --> 00:13:00.086]  I see racial tensions at an all-time high.
[00:13:00.366 --> 00:13:03.607]  I see faculty members disrespecting students' First Amendment rights.
[00:13:03.907 --> 00:13:12.308]  And I see the administration cracking down with an authoritarian speech code, literally threatening students with police action should they say anything hurtful or offensive.
[00:13:12.628 --> 00:13:14.249]  And I think that that's a negative step.
[00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:20.690]  And I think that's a step backwards towards diversity, rather than a step forward in achieving equality on campus.
[00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:35.282]  It's nice to see that not everybody is jumping in on the hatred bandwagon, but check this out.
[00:13:35.322 --> 00:13:38.664]  This is from the head of the student body of the University of Missouri, Peyton Head.
[00:13:39.025 --> 00:13:40.185]  Students, please take precautions.
[00:13:40.225 --> 00:13:41.947]  Stay away from windows in residence halls.
[00:13:41.967 --> 00:13:45.429]  The KKK has been confirmed to be sighted on campus.
[00:13:45.489 --> 00:13:49.452]  I'm working with MUPD, the state trooper, and the National Guard.
[00:13:49.812 --> 00:13:51.033]  So people were sending this out.
[00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:54.475]  That's what led to the professor saying, hey, I'm still going to have the test.
[00:13:54.495 --> 00:13:55.496]  You guys need to show up.
[00:13:55.816 --> 00:13:59.218]  People called for his immediate resignation and dismissal.
[00:13:59.458 --> 00:13:59.979]  Turns out,
[00:14:01.178 --> 00:14:03.319]  He spreaded a false KKK threat.
[00:14:03.359 --> 00:14:04.520]  This is out of the Washington Post.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.483]  University of Missouri student body president apologizes for spreading false KKK threat.
[00:14:10.003 --> 00:14:14.465]  But he apologized, so I guess there's no harm, even though people are now calling for his resignation.
[00:14:14.906 --> 00:14:19.628]  It's this type of behavior that we're going to see leading up to things like the death of Christmas.
[00:14:19.948 --> 00:14:20.989]  Here's a report from John Bowne.
[00:14:22.554 --> 00:14:25.196]  The Starbucks Holiday Cup Controversy.
[00:14:25.556 --> 00:14:27.998]  I know, who really cares, right?
[00:14:28.098 --> 00:14:32.501]  The arrival of Starbucks Holiday themed cups means Christmas is on the way.
[00:14:32.882 --> 00:14:33.682]  It's huge.
[00:14:33.802 --> 00:14:36.484]  People wouldn't even go to Starbucks regularly.
[00:14:36.504 --> 00:14:39.887]  They come during the holidays because we have the red cups.
[00:14:40.427 --> 00:14:43.191]  This year's design is just a plain red cup.
[00:14:43.572 --> 00:14:51.403]  Granting a corporate entity a controversial stranglehold over a Christian holiday takes the Christ out of Christmas.
[00:14:51.723 --> 00:14:55.249]  But to most Americans, something just doesn't feel right.
[00:15:08.996 --> 00:15:16.119]  Maybe it's the constant barrage of media surrounding the war between left-wing mandates and religious beliefs in America.
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.180]  Absolutely ludicrous!
[00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:20.241]  Don't smile at me.
[00:15:21.062 --> 00:15:25.664]  I'm not being disrespectful to you.
[00:15:26.024 --> 00:15:27.925]  You absolutely have disrespected us.
[00:15:28.025 --> 00:15:31.867]  You're telling us that we don't deserve the same rights that you have.
[00:15:31.887 --> 00:15:34.268]  That you've enjoyed your entire life.
[00:15:35.048 --> 00:15:36.389]  Would you do this to an interracial couple?
[00:15:39.753 --> 00:15:39.873]  Obama
[00:16:03.553 --> 00:16:05.394]  And I'll say it straight up because no one else will.
[00:16:05.474 --> 00:16:05.834]  You will.
[00:16:06.454 --> 00:16:08.054]  Obama is a Muslim through and through.
[00:16:08.074 --> 00:16:11.175]  Obama sympathizes with a Muslim caliphate.
[00:16:11.555 --> 00:16:15.156]  Obama simplifies, simplifies, sympathizes with the mullahs in Tehran.
[00:16:15.597 --> 00:16:18.717]  He sympathizes with the radicals in the Far East.
[00:16:18.797 --> 00:16:21.618]  And that's why he never holds any of them accountable.
[00:16:21.798 --> 00:16:23.819]  He doesn't sympathize with Christians and Jews.
[00:16:24.279 --> 00:16:25.960]  He sympathizes with his own people.
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.120]  And that's why these things are happening.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.921]  And it's time that someone called it like it is.
[00:16:31.724 --> 00:16:39.127]  And that's why, you know Alex, a couple years ago I was in front of the World War II Memorial, and it rang true, and it rings true now more than ever.
[00:16:39.147 --> 00:16:46.011]  I said, President Obama, get up off your knees, put the Koran down, and come out with your hands up.
[00:16:46.311 --> 00:16:48.312]  He is not for Christians and Jews.
[00:16:48.772 --> 00:16:49.452]  He's for Muslims.
[00:16:49.912 --> 00:16:58.276]  Or maybe it's the knowledge, conscious or unconscious, that Christians are being wiped out in the Middle East and in Africa, and fleeing to America.
[00:16:58.596 --> 00:16:59.877]  The Daily Mail reports
[00:17:00.177 --> 00:17:12.885]  In Iraq, where Christians are being butchered in mass executions by the Islamic State, their number has plunged from 1 million to just 275,000 in the last 12 years alone.
[00:17:13.325 --> 00:17:29.295]  In parts of the Middle East, particularly in Syria and Iraq, the crisis is so severe that, barring significant interventions on the part of the world powers, the Christian presence may disappear completely within a decade or even sooner.
[00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:40.486]  Elijah Brown of 21st Century Wilberforce said, Last Christmas was the first time that bells did not ring out in the city of Mosul in 2000 years.
[00:17:40.886 --> 00:17:47.693]  I think that speaks to the reality that hundreds of thousands of Christian families are living on the edge of extinction.
[00:17:48.093 --> 00:17:49.295]  What has happened in Mosul?
[00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:50.455]  We're good to go.
[00:19:02.432 --> 00:19:03.693]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:19:03.974 --> 00:19:05.275]  You can't survive without it.
[00:19:05.455 --> 00:19:06.376]  But where do you get it?
[00:19:06.657 --> 00:19:12.423]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:19:12.663 --> 00:19:18.370]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:35.428]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:37.950]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:39.511]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:19:39.771 --> 00:19:40.552]  Easy assembly.
[00:19:40.812 --> 00:19:41.432]  Low maintenance.
[00:19:41.732 --> 00:19:43.554]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:20:01.266 --> 00:20:03.607]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[00:20:03.947 --> 00:20:10.370]  Tried and true trusted herbs and extracts fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:18.034]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts.
[00:20:18.154 --> 00:20:18.474]  I'm good.
[00:20:42.386 --> 00:20:43.407]  We're good to go.
[00:21:01.898 --> 00:21:06.903]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:21:07.143 --> 00:21:13.250]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:20.417]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:21:20.757 --> 00:21:30.704]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[00:21:31.264 --> 00:21:37.189]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:40.111]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:21:41.292 --> 00:21:45.596]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:21:45.857 --> 00:21:47.478]  No needles, no injections.
[00:21:47.739 --> 00:21:49.220]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.422]  Try it for yourself.
[00:21:50.602 --> 00:21:51.603]  Discover the secret.
[00:21:51.843 --> 00:21:52.163]  Secret 12.
[00:21:52.904 --> 00:21:58.090]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:22:19.435 --> 00:22:19.955]  Welcome back.
[00:22:20.355 --> 00:22:30.362]  Coming up, we're going to have a two-part interview with a doctor from Germany who's using space technology and space medicine and applying it here on Earth to help people with a variety of problems.
[00:22:30.382 --> 00:22:31.522]  Should be a very interesting interview.
[00:22:31.782 --> 00:22:38.467]  But first, if you were to open up your wallet, you'd probably have cash in it, along with some credit cards, maybe some pictures of your kids and other things.
[00:22:39.227 --> 00:22:45.992]  Well, Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, recently on a trip to the UK, stated, your children will not know what money is.
[00:22:46.033 --> 00:22:48.334]  He was speaking to some university students at the time.
[00:22:48.995 --> 00:22:52.338]  He forecasted the death of cash by the time current university students have a family.
[00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:58.222]  Cash is still used for more than half of payments by consumers, according to Payments UK, the industry body.
[00:22:58.542 --> 00:23:04.367]  But its popularity is falling as people switch to cards and smartphone apps such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet.
[00:23:04.968 --> 00:23:06.108]  Mr. Cook said, I quote,
[00:23:06.849 --> 00:23:09.072]  Your kids will not know what money is.
[00:23:09.092 --> 00:23:10.173]  And guess what?
[00:23:10.213 --> 00:23:15.439]  When they don't know what money is, it will be total New World Order tyranny will be befalling them.
[00:23:15.479 --> 00:23:17.080]  They will not be able to go to the store.
[00:23:17.121 --> 00:23:18.342]  They will not be able to travel.
[00:23:18.402 --> 00:23:23.327]  They will not be able to buy and sell without the graciousness of the technocracy.
[00:23:23.908 --> 00:23:25.790]  Which is exactly what Hillary Clinton wants to do.
[00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.412]  She wants to have everything controlled by computers, especially the VA.
[00:23:28.712 --> 00:23:29.873]  Here it is out of the Washington Times.
[00:23:30.334 --> 00:23:32.175]  In fact, here's what she had to say.
[00:23:32.195 --> 00:23:36.639]  She doesn't think it's quite as big a problem as you and I might think.
[00:23:36.739 --> 00:23:39.402]  She was here on Rachel Maddow at the end of October.
[00:23:39.422 --> 00:23:40.343]  Here's what she had to say.
[00:23:47.659 --> 00:23:55.744]  There have been a number of surveys of veterans, and overall, veterans who do get treated are satisfied with their treatment.
[00:23:55.944 --> 00:23:57.746]  Much more so than people in the regulations.
[00:23:57.846 --> 00:23:58.706]  It's exactly right.
[00:23:58.766 --> 00:24:00.528]  But in part because there has been real scandal.
[00:24:00.548 --> 00:24:05.531]  There has been, but it's not been as widespread as it has been made out to be.
[00:24:05.911 --> 00:24:13.616]  And now, just one day after Veterans Day, we learned that the VA has paid over $142 million in bonuses, and that's amid all the scandals.
[00:24:14.136 --> 00:24:20.640]  In fact, we have Leanne McAdoo with just a laundry list of just a few of the scandals that have been troubling the agency.
[00:24:21.641 --> 00:24:28.104]  Amid the VA scandals, Veterans Affairs paid out $142 million in bonuses.
[00:24:28.605 --> 00:24:30.226]  Let's take a look at some of the recipients.
[00:24:31.383 --> 00:24:45.411]  In Wisconsin, the former chief of staff of the VA Medical Center there, Dr. David Houlihan, whom veterans nicknamed the Candyman because of his prolific prescribing of narcotics, received a $4,000 bonus in December.
[00:24:46.011 --> 00:24:56.638]  This was nine months after an Inspector General investigation report concluded that he was prescribing alarmingly high amounts of opiates to veterans, one of whom died.
[00:24:57.578 --> 00:25:04.426]  In Colorado, more than $20,000 in bonuses were doled out to several VA officials headquartered in Washington.
[00:25:04.666 --> 00:25:08.250]  They oversaw a flawed facility construction project in Denver.
[00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:08.931]  In St.
[00:25:08.991 --> 00:25:14.337]  Cloud, Minnesota, Chief of Staff Dr. Susan Markstrom got a $3,900 bonus in 2014.
[00:25:15.138 --> 00:25:18.762]  This was after she was cited in an internal investigation report
[00:25:18.942 --> 00:25:24.823]  that concluded mismanagement led to mass resignations of health care providers at her facility.
[00:25:25.183 --> 00:25:31.644]  In Augusta, Georgia, VA financial manager Jed Fillingham was awarded a $900 performance bonus.
[00:25:31.825 --> 00:25:44.207]  Fillingham drew scrutiny from Congress last year after news reports revealed he admitted drinking and driving a government truck to a VA meeting in 2010 and a co-worker fell from the truck and was killed.
[00:25:44.727 --> 00:25:49.889]  Fillingham resigned from the VA after the incident, but was rehired in March 2011.
[00:25:50.969 --> 00:25:59.812]  In Arizona, Sandra Flint, now former director of the Phoenix Regional VA Benefits Office, received a bonus of $8,348.
[00:26:00.952 --> 00:26:12.215]  Irate veterans confronted Flint at a public forum in August 2014 over a backlog of about 8,200 pending benefit claims, about half of which were pending longer than 125 days.
[00:26:14.196 --> 00:26:14.597]  In St.
[00:26:14.657 --> 00:26:24.245]  Paul, Minnesota, VA Benefits Office Director Kimberly Graves received a bonus of $8,697 for her performance in 2014.
[00:26:25.226 --> 00:26:33.954]  This included improperly using her authority to engineer a switch into her current post, a move that meant Graves improperly pocketed $129,000.
[00:26:39.505 --> 00:26:43.667]  So even the people running the death panels were receiving bonuses.
[00:26:44.607 --> 00:26:45.387]  That is amazing.
[00:26:45.527 --> 00:26:47.488]  I can't believe this is happening in this country now.
[00:26:47.928 --> 00:26:52.210]  But it doesn't surprise me amid what's going on with this presidential race and us funding ISIS.
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.661]  Oh man, you just maybe want to crawl up into a hole.
[00:26:56.041 --> 00:26:59.023]  Now, a family that isn't doing that are the Steiners.
[00:26:59.043 --> 00:27:05.306]  This is a family of ranchers and rodeo champions that have been around in the Central Texas area for years.
[00:27:05.986 --> 00:27:17.892]  And this is a pretty special video that we put together just showing how they have taken all the negativity that's out there and just turning themselves loose and becoming positive people and just really unleashing the full force of the human body.
[00:27:18.032 --> 00:27:18.432]  Here it is.
[00:27:53.331 --> 00:28:04.978]  Okay, so two years ago, I found myself on the couch, completely out of shape, overweight, I had no muscle tone, and I just felt horrible.
[00:28:05.478 --> 00:28:09.000]  And I knew that I needed to make a change, and I needed to start going to the gym and working out.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:09.920]  And I did that.
[00:28:10.501 --> 00:28:13.843]  I would force myself to go to the gym, and it just really wasn't going very well.
[00:28:14.183 --> 00:28:17.745]  That's when my buddy Alex told me to try the Super Male Vitality.
[00:28:20.188 --> 00:28:21.549]  That's what changed everything for me.
[00:28:41.547 --> 00:28:43.007]  And I said, here, take some home, try it.
[00:28:43.107 --> 00:28:49.669]  Well, a few weeks later, he came in blown away and said, I want to buy three boxes of this stuff to give my friends and family.
[00:28:50.089 --> 00:28:51.609]  It's simply amazing.
[00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:52.889]  He said, why does it work so well?
[00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:57.470]  And I said, listen, go to InfoWarsLife.com, watch the informational videos with Dr. Group and others.
[00:28:57.691 --> 00:28:59.191]  They understand how it all works.
[00:28:59.471 --> 00:29:01.051]  I know that it works for me.
[00:29:01.171 --> 00:29:02.312]  That's all I understand.
[00:29:02.572 --> 00:29:07.613]  The science, the facts, the research, people's testimonials, they're all on InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:29:07.633 --> 00:29:08.613]  You can check it out for yourself.
[00:29:09.213 --> 00:29:10.314]  I wanted to go to the gym.
[00:29:10.574 --> 00:29:20.400]  I wanted to push myself and work out harder, and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that, which I would have never done.
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:22.962]  I never would have done that two years ago.
[00:29:23.562 --> 00:29:27.185]  Shane has said over and over again, more than just libido and energy,
[00:29:27.725 --> 00:29:29.487]  It made him want to get into the gym more.
[00:29:29.847 --> 00:29:31.308]  It made him want to get in better shape.
[00:29:31.348 --> 00:29:33.951]  And believe me, the Steiners have amazing genetics.
[00:29:34.511 --> 00:29:36.954]  His brother is a world champion steer wrestler.
[00:29:37.274 --> 00:29:41.277]  His dad, Bobby Steiner, is a famous world champion bull rider.
[00:29:41.458 --> 00:29:43.139]  They've got natural genetics.
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:48.304]  But when you added this to the mix, in Shane's own words, it took him to the next level.
[00:30:05.262 --> 00:30:06.983]  Shane noticed the mental clarity.
[00:30:07.424 --> 00:30:10.906]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass.
[00:30:11.026 --> 00:30:12.327]  He's already completely shredded.
[00:30:12.527 --> 00:30:15.189]  I gotta admit, for me, the biggest effect has been libido.
[00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:21.593]  Now, I've never claimed to have a body like some beach model, but back when I was 20, 22 years old and worked out every day, I looked great.
[00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:27.658]  But over the years and being married, having three kids, working 18 hours a day, I gained basically 100 pounds.
[00:30:27.818 --> 00:30:30.940]  And it's been a long process of losing that weight in the last four years.
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.682]  But if you look at the photos and the videos,
[00:30:33.942 --> 00:30:34.242]  I think so.
[00:30:53.127 --> 00:31:03.189]  This has actually made me feel so good that here lately, about a year ago, I started training jiu-jitsu and that kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing.
[00:31:03.209 --> 00:31:15.691]  I mean, it's amazing that two years ago I was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now I'm training with MMA fighters and just doing stuff that I never thought that I would be doing ever again.
[00:31:15.971 --> 00:31:17.812]  So, Supermail Vitality has
[00:31:18.712 --> 00:31:19.153]  I don't know.
[00:31:28.991 --> 00:31:29.431]  You'll love it.
[00:32:13.377 --> 00:32:22.661]  Bottom line folks, you want to discover the power of super male vitality and super female vitality for yourself by visiting InfoWarsLife.com today or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:32:36.872 --> 00:32:40.317]  Dr. Group joins us for the Balance of the Sour to talk about solutions.
[00:32:40.337 --> 00:32:41.538]  We have them up every couple of weeks.
[00:32:42.119 --> 00:32:44.101]  We have been trying to launch this for the last year.
[00:32:44.142 --> 00:32:47.506]  We got all of the organic ingredients to do it.
[00:32:47.987 --> 00:32:54.996]  And we've come up with a new Living Defense Harmful Organism Cleansing Dietary Supplement and it is extremely affordable.
[00:32:55.736 --> 00:33:03.180]  It is brimming with the capsules, and the way I read the facts, this could do a cleanse for really a family of four or five people.
[00:33:03.561 --> 00:33:10.044]  Dr. Group, let's just get into the product now, and then into parasites themselves, what folks really want to hear about in the next segment.
[00:33:10.064 --> 00:33:12.846]  But thank you for developing this for Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:13.126 --> 00:33:15.047]  Tell us about Living Defense and why it's so special.
[00:33:16.107 --> 00:33:20.871]  Well, it's really special because it's part of the problem that we're dealing with today.
[00:33:20.911 --> 00:33:38.985]  When the earth becomes sick, and the earth's soils become acidic, and the internal bodies become acidic because of all the toxic food in the air, and the beverages that people are consuming, it sets up an environment that's ripe for harmful organisms to live, either on the earth
[00:33:39.485 --> 00:33:44.128]  That's why a lot of the plants are infested with harmful organisms or inside the body.
[00:33:44.648 --> 00:33:51.391]  And years ago, we linked every single disease process to an overgrowth of organisms in the body.
[00:33:51.411 --> 00:34:02.738]  And when people hear the word parasite, which the FDA does not like us to use, they actually came down on us and made us take the word parasite off everywhere because we were exposing
[00:34:04.038 --> 00:34:17.003]  Uh, what the globalists have been doing, spreading these parasites and creating this environment, which is great for them to live in for years and years and years because they know they drain us of energy, they make us sick.
[00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:22.691]  So, we had to actually change the word parasite to harmful organism.
[00:34:23.191 --> 00:34:35.935]  And when we talk about harmful organisms, it's the definition, actually, the medical definition of parasite is any harmful organism that lives off of a host mechanism.
[00:34:36.475 --> 00:34:44.417]  Most people just think parasites are worms, but harmful organisms are bacteria, viruses that you can get through flu shots.
[00:34:45.177 --> 00:34:52.639]  Funguses, yeast, we literally have an epidemic going on right now with molds and fungus and yeast living in everybody's body.
[00:34:53.039 --> 00:34:56.040]  This is something that I heard about over a decade ago, I didn't really believe.
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:02.581]  I did one of these cleanses, or invasive organism, or harmful organism cleanses.
[00:35:02.962 --> 00:35:05.182]  It really hurt a lot, but it did do a lot.
[00:35:05.862 --> 00:35:09.443]  With this, this was not painful like some other cleanses I've done.
[00:35:09.503 --> 00:35:12.044]  The product is available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:35:13.004 --> 00:35:24.274]  I've always read and heard that just one of the ingredients, uh, black walnuts, uh, you know, is really, uh, good at flushing parasites and that, you know, animals out in the fields eat them and stuff to naturally do this.
[00:35:24.494 --> 00:35:27.096]  We do cleanses on our dogs, our cats, our horses, our cows.
[00:35:27.156 --> 00:35:27.637]  Why not us?
[00:35:28.237 --> 00:35:33.898]  Well, because they don't want you to know about that you need to do a parasite or a harmful organism cleanse.
[00:35:33.918 --> 00:35:34.578]  That's the thing.
[00:35:34.638 --> 00:35:35.519]  It's so secretive.
[00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:41.400]  And when we were doing our research into the root cause of every single disease, there's been plenty of proof.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.120]  The statistics are clear.
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:47.001]  Nine out of ten people are infested with harmful organisms like parasites.
[00:35:47.341 --> 00:35:51.462]  Parasites can be transmitted by people, pets, food, the environment, and so many other sources.
[00:35:51.882 --> 00:35:55.883]  Once parasites have made it inside your body, they steal your nutrients and release toxic waste.
[00:35:55.943 --> 00:35:57.203]  They use the bathroom inside of you.
[00:35:57.623 --> 00:36:00.846]  It's time to start eliminating toxic and harmful organisms from your body.
[00:36:00.926 --> 00:36:05.511]  Introducing Living Defense, the new harmful organism cleanser by InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:05.851 --> 00:36:11.257]  Living Defense uses wild-crafted organic herbs to help naturally cleanse harmful organisms from the body.
[00:36:11.597 --> 00:36:13.959]  We are expected to sell out of this very, very quickly.
[00:36:13.979 --> 00:36:15.601]  This is our limited first-time run.
[00:36:15.861 --> 00:36:20.326]  So visit InfoWarsLife.com today to try Living Defense today while supplies last.
[00:36:30.406 --> 00:36:32.187]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:36:32.508 --> 00:36:41.775]  Now our final two segments we're going to be joined with a professor and he's actually yields two doctorates and he works out of the International Academy for Regulatory Medicine and Consciousness Research.
[00:36:42.115 --> 00:36:43.856]  There should be some pretty interesting information.
[00:36:43.876 --> 00:36:52.943]  He's also going to have a translator and due to the time constraints we may edit out some of the translation portion of this and but without further ado let's go to our interview.
[00:36:53.303 --> 00:36:56.586]  Hi, Professor Ettinger, thanks for joining us here on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:36:57.146 --> 00:37:08.916]  Please give me a brief introduction of yourself and the International Academy of Regulatory Medicine and Consciousness Research and describe how what you call as space medicine, how it basically works and how you're using these concepts today.
[00:37:09.456 --> 00:37:11.978]  And what attracted you to the space medicine concept?
[00:37:12.779 --> 00:37:21.526]  I am a neurologist, psychiatrist, psychotherapist and professor of regulation and space medicine.
[00:37:24.042 --> 00:37:26.643]  Well, I am Professor Eddie Ngo.
[00:37:26.843 --> 00:37:36.225]  I'm a specialist in neurology, psychiatry, psychotherapy, acupuncture, psychoimmunology, energy and space medicine travel and energy medicine.
[00:37:36.805 --> 00:37:42.266]  Yeah, I was actually working as a conventional medical practitioner and
[00:37:53.719 --> 00:38:01.321]  20 years, almost 20, for 20 years and right now since 2003 I'm working as an alternative medical practitioner.
[00:38:01.341 --> 00:38:07.322]  I have also come to know about a redox analysis which actually can tell you
[00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:34.854]  And you can exactly predict and give the right minerals and vitamins to compensate and balance the health situation and to bring back the person back to normality.
[00:38:52.703 --> 00:38:54.145]  Just so you know, I have to say something here.
[00:38:54.185 --> 00:38:56.707]  It doesn't matter.
[00:38:57.868 --> 00:39:02.033]  Okay, so that was one of the procedures that saved my life, so to speak.
[00:39:02.093 --> 00:39:12.503]  So I had severe stomach ulcers, the bleeding didn't stop and after giving, in principle, this powder, which was prescribed here, the whole thing was just silent for three weeks.
[00:39:13.789 --> 00:39:36.399]  Yeah, as I already said I had this intestinal and gastric ulcer and it is one of these processes which really helped me out and I become healthy and when you become healthy again due to a completely different course of treatment and after conventional medicine and some of the real honest efforts from conventional friends really couldn't help any longer.
[00:39:36.419 --> 00:39:38.520]  You of course search for alternatives.
[00:39:39.739 --> 00:39:48.627]  After getting treated by this alternative way of medicine, I was actually in research how this actually works and since then I am practicing alternative medicine.
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:09.062]  And I was lucky enough to work along with Professor Bajewski and Dr. Kutschera for four years.
[00:40:34.468 --> 00:40:44.674]  Dr. Kutchera has actually taken care of the biophysical and biochemical systems for over 30 years.
[00:40:44.734 --> 00:40:49.217]  He also has worked in internal medicine for over 30 years.
[00:41:02.799 --> 00:41:11.927]  Yeah, and he is one of the main personalities who actually took care of Dr. Polyakov, who actually safely came back to Earth both healthy and regenerated after 437 days in orbit.
[00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:33.811]  Yeah, and I was really curious enough to know what they actually was doing with these cosmonauts because it was nearly impossible for them to come back so healthy back from orbit.
[00:41:54.392 --> 00:42:05.722]  So, I had this luck to work along with Professor Zagorski, who is also my teacher, and then come closer to the space medicine.
[00:42:07.662 --> 00:42:10.644]  So, and that basically took my breath away, what they did.
[00:42:10.664 --> 00:42:25.691]  That is, they completely compared themselves to nature, because they noticed, also due to the American trials, that such a complicated, incredibly fast system, like the body, that you can't just treat it with drugs.
[00:42:29.285 --> 00:42:32.607]  And I was very much surprised the way they are treating the person.
[00:42:33.027 --> 00:42:36.309]  A human being cannot be looked at in an isolated manner.
[00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:39.131]  He's always a part of a total continuum.
[00:42:40.472 --> 00:42:45.975]  Unlike the American system or the Western system treating a person on the basis of the symptoms.
[00:42:46.996 --> 00:42:48.737]  Adrenaline has other advantages.
[00:42:48.817 --> 00:42:52.219]  Adrenaline is the strongest stimulant in the immune system.
[00:42:52.539 --> 00:42:55.141]  That's why cancer patients have very little adrenaline.
[00:42:55.839 --> 00:42:58.881]  Adrenaline is the strongest stimulator in our body system.
[00:42:59.262 --> 00:43:05.526]  And for the very same reason, tumor patients are having lower levels of Adrenaline.
[00:43:05.546 --> 00:43:14.753]  That means, if we have a lower level of Adrenaline hormone, the whole system is going to break down.
[00:43:22.827 --> 00:43:25.449]  We are also activating cortisone hormones against infections.
[00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:26.830]  We also try to promote
[00:43:52.615 --> 00:43:58.597]  So, and above all, it is also about that we have a certain current in the cells.
[00:43:58.617 --> 00:44:03.519]  This has been very well recognized in space.
[00:44:03.559 --> 00:44:11.501]  And when this current collapses, that is, when our cell membranes are at 15 millivolts, like in tumor cells, then we no longer have sufficient energy formation.
[00:44:20.009 --> 00:44:29.157]  There's this current in our body which is very vital and if this is below 15 millivolts the body is not going to function properly.
[00:44:29.177 --> 00:44:33.240]  We have several systems derived from space medicine which really help us to
[00:44:44.016 --> 00:44:50.257]  Yeah, you have to imagine, in space astronauts and cosmonauts were subjected to loud noises of up to 80 decibels
[00:45:10.828 --> 00:45:12.189]  There was a complete disruption of biorhythmics.
[00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:13.830]  Yeah, and the serotonin couldn't be activated properly.
[00:45:14.191 --> 00:45:16.532]  And which results in a series of disorders and diseases.
[00:45:40.838 --> 00:45:44.620]  So that means we have 7 billion cells in our body and there are 30,000 enzymes
[00:46:08.857 --> 00:46:14.059]  Which has to be changed and replaced in every second.
[00:46:38.064 --> 00:46:44.369]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:46:44.729 --> 00:46:46.211]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:46:46.231 --> 00:46:47.612]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:46:47.872 --> 00:46:48.993]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:46:49.553 --> 00:46:54.317]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:54.437 --> 00:46:58.540]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:46:58.921 --> 00:47:00.402]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:47:00.422 --> 00:47:01.763]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:47:01.803 --> 00:47:03.885]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:07.915 --> 00:47:12.757]  And why wearing a Hillary for President t-shirt might get you punched in the face?
[00:47:13.157 --> 00:47:15.018]  They thought it said Hillary for President.
[00:47:15.878 --> 00:47:20.339]  He said, I was seconds away from sending my bar back over here to punch you in the face.
[00:47:20.579 --> 00:47:24.441]  Since you're wearing a Hillary for Prison shirt, you don't have to buy drinks here.
[00:47:24.721 --> 00:47:25.821]  Everything's on the house.
[00:47:26.301 --> 00:47:27.362]  Hillary for President!
[00:47:28.022 --> 00:47:29.723]  Hillary's not surging, I tell you that.
[00:47:29.763 --> 00:47:30.503]  They're not saying that.
[00:47:31.503 --> 00:47:32.164]  They're not saying that.
[00:47:32.944 --> 00:47:33.264]  Thank you.
[00:48:04.986 --> 00:48:05.566]  There you have it.
[00:48:05.646 --> 00:48:08.407]  Donald Trump endorses Hillary for prison.
[00:48:08.987 --> 00:48:13.109]  Get your Hillary for prison 2016 t-shirt at the Infowars store.
[00:48:13.389 --> 00:48:16.010]  And on the back it says, legalize freedom.
[00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:20.151]  Show your disapproval of Hillary by buying your t-shirt today.
[00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.711]  But what she's done is criminal.
[00:48:22.872 --> 00:48:25.453]  This is an American president.
[00:48:25.793 --> 00:48:26.933]  Just add puppet.
[00:48:27.313 --> 00:48:29.634]  Then vote and repeat every four years.
[00:48:42.257 --> 00:48:51.424]  Going back to symptoms, Professor Ettinger, it seems like Western medicine, that's all they concentrate on is just treating symptoms, especially when it comes to chronic illnesses.
[00:48:51.444 --> 00:48:53.386]  They're not really looking at the cause.
[00:48:53.846 --> 00:48:57.329]  Now, how is that different than what you're doing over at your academy?
[00:48:59.349 --> 00:49:06.635]  Well, the main important thing is to work on... we have three different levels in the body and the first level is organic level and to have
[00:49:22.867 --> 00:49:27.129]  And balance between sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system.
[00:49:27.449 --> 00:49:34.952]  So you have to imagine that the unconscious part in us are actually controlling us for the 99% and rest of the one person we just have control over the rest one person in our body.
[00:49:50.242 --> 00:49:56.863]  A second point I would like to mention is that the pineal glands are the strongest glands in our body to make changes in our body.
[00:49:56.883 --> 00:49:57.763]  If sun rays are being
[00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:21.853]  Pass through this pineal gland.
[00:50:21.873 --> 00:50:26.158]  There is this enormous effect of getting healthy.
[00:50:26.178 --> 00:50:29.923]  It's thousand times more powerful than having this radiation through the body.
[00:50:39.316 --> 00:50:45.959]  When we talk about quantum physics, we have in our body positively charged quanta and negatively charged quanta.
[00:51:01.718 --> 00:51:08.079]  The negatively charged quanta, which actually contributes to our health, which are beneficial to our health, comprises almost two-thirds of the cosmos and it regenerates us.
[00:51:24.793 --> 00:51:30.639]  There's this amazing study in the Western, Southwestern and Stanford Universities, where they say
[00:51:50.439 --> 00:51:53.321]  Trauma is arising from the cell pathological conditions.
[00:52:11.656 --> 00:52:18.137]  These pathological cells are the reasons for de-mineralization and the destruction of our immune system.
[00:52:18.397 --> 00:52:28.759]  How long have you been treating patients at your facility and what are the varieties of, I guess, illnesses or conditions people are coming in with and that you're having success with in treating them?
[00:52:29.359 --> 00:52:30.819]  Well, we basically treat all diseases.
[00:52:30.839 --> 00:52:34.100]  Of course, there are some key points in the regulation medicine.
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:38.881]  For example, at the very front, there are certainly also severe infectious diseases and allergies.
[00:52:39.485 --> 00:52:49.393]  Yeah, we are usually treating all kinds of patients, but we do have a lot of patients with infections.
[00:52:55.737 --> 00:53:01.081]  Also patients with neurological disorders and internal problems.
[00:53:01.101 --> 00:53:06.565]  Really high quota of tumor patients, cancer patients.
[00:53:06.645 --> 00:53:08.646]  Various children with lots of illnesses.
[00:53:08.706 --> 00:53:10.428]  According to ICDS,
[00:53:24.817 --> 00:53:31.242]  All the 21 illnesses which were being treated by us had an 84% improvement.
[00:53:31.282 --> 00:53:34.545]  That means 8 times better than in a conventional medicine.
[00:53:34.565 --> 00:53:35.065]  So we can also
[00:53:53.246 --> 00:54:05.901]  We can't implement this kind of therapy in Germany because we do have a really hard system of medical system here and we do have a big problem of introducing this kind of therapy.
[00:54:05.921 --> 00:54:07.924]  So you would be knowing that from the FDA in America.
[00:54:11.468 --> 00:54:21.770]  So I definitely agree with what you're saying about the FDA in regards to stagnating health development here in this country, and I can only imagine what you're going through in Germany.
[00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:25.191]  But let's look at smart meters, cell phones, and Wi-Fi.
[00:54:25.231 --> 00:54:31.372]  These are kind of invisible forces that seem to be causing all kinds of weird conditions in people here in the United States.
[00:54:31.812 --> 00:54:36.873]  Are you seeing the same types of conditions in Europe, and how can people mitigate these negative effects?
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:45.146]  The radiation threshold in USA and Russia is an acceptable 200 nanotesla, whereas here in Germany they have permitted a ridiculous level of 10,000, 100,000 nanotesla.
[00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:14.537]  That means here in Germany and quite a whole part of Europe and in Switzerland we do have an increased rate of tumors.
[00:55:14.557 --> 00:55:16.099]  So if you take the case of children
[00:55:34.326 --> 00:55:41.650]  Up to seven years of age, they are five to ten times more prone to the radiations than adults.
[00:55:42.370 --> 00:55:52.495]  In case of adults, in case we are having a telephone call for five minutes time, there is a disruption of our body system 169 times.
[00:55:52.535 --> 00:55:55.337]  We are destroying our proteins.
[00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:06.851]  169 times.
[00:56:07.451 --> 00:56:14.953]  So, in order to get back to the normal situation our body needs a 20 minutes rest from all kind of mobile devices.
[00:56:15.893 --> 00:56:19.294]  So, this is the reason why I say just aluminum chips are not enough.
[00:56:32.745 --> 00:56:37.688]  So the question is, how do I get this particular person out of this pathological situation?
[00:57:01.178 --> 00:57:08.300]  So, it means these radiations are not, I mean, balls are not a barrier for these radiations.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.341]  That means we have to fight against these scalar waves.
[00:57:30.757 --> 00:57:34.319]  Yeah, that means we have to work with an open switch.
[00:57:34.339 --> 00:57:44.644]  Professor, I know we've just scratched the surface on the work you're doing and we're going to point people to the three informational videos you guys sent me earlier in the month so people can learn more about the kind of work you're doing.
[00:57:44.684 --> 00:57:53.628]  I know we've just scratched the surface and it's pretty technical information and we've had, you know, the translation issues, but thank you for joining us on the InfoWars Nightly News and best of luck in your future work.
[00:57:54.946 --> 00:58:01.836]  Thank you so much, and thank you so much for the chance you've given us to introduce our concept.
[00:58:02.497 --> 00:58:03.118]  Great, thanks.
[00:58:03.739 --> 00:58:05.421]  All right, that's it for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:58:05.461 --> 00:58:06.683]  Join us back here at 7 p.m.
[00:58:06.723 --> 00:58:07.764]  Central tomorrow night.
[00:58:08.005 --> 00:58:08.706]  Rob Dew reporting.
[00:58:08.746 --> 00:58:09.447]  Thank you for watching.
[00:58:33.492 --> 00:58:37.829]  One of the motherfuckers.
[00:58:48.823 --> 00:58:49.964]  Knockout is back.
[00:58:50.304 --> 00:59:01.411]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:01.831 --> 00:59:03.532]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:04.013 --> 00:59:13.158]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:13.539 --> 00:59:15.320]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.761]  It's the same price
[00:59:17.481 --> 00:59:23.364]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[00:59:23.904 --> 00:59:30.148]  It's got the GABA, so it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[00:59:30.648 --> 00:59:30.768]  It's $19.95.
[00:59:31.488 --> 00:59:33.830]  You take one or two of these,
[00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:38.213]  And it just is really clean restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[00:59:38.554 --> 00:59:42.477]  It's what I've experienced and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
[00:59:42.758 --> 00:59:43.719]  Infowarslife.com.
