[00:00:11.107 --> 00:00:15.672]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an extremely important public service announcement update.
[00:00:16.112 --> 00:00:17.033]  Please take notes.
[00:00:17.273 --> 00:00:23.660]  Check out the claims we're about to make here for yourself, so that you can protect yourself, your family, and those around you.
[00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:26.663]  This is so critical, what's happening right now.
[00:00:27.204 --> 00:00:32.729]  There is a massive push across the world, a huge PR campaign.
[00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:48.239]  To arrest people that don't vaccinate their children, to forcibly inoculate, to not let people travel, to publish the names and addresses of people that don't vaccinate as if they're pedophiles or something.
[00:00:48.899 --> 00:01:02.908]  This is a huge push and this is happening right now because Merck whistleblowers and head CDC doctors and others are going public and saying the vaccines are linked to autism, we covered it up.
[00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:08.484]  And so you're seeing a huge push now saying measles, measles, you know, everybody's going to die.
[00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:09.245]  Take vaccines.
[00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:10.225]  They're safe and effective.
[00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:11.646]  No side effects, no problems.
[00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:17.089]  Arrest whoever says that they're bad because this is an establishment meltdown.
[00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.453]  I recently interviewed Dr. Wakefield, his partner, top
[00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:36.448]  Doctor when it comes to the stomach and intestines in England has been exonerated and given his medical license back and the court completely censured the British
[00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:42.428]  Regulators that had basically lynched Wakefield and his partner.
[00:01:42.628 --> 00:01:45.850]  What we're looking at is a system that is in meltdown right now.
[00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.832]  And they're in meltdown for a number of reasons.
[00:01:47.892 --> 00:01:51.335]  You can only sustain a lie, a falsehood, for so long.
[00:01:51.395 --> 00:02:02.444]  And now that Dr. William Thompson, senior CDC scientist, has come forward and said that they have known for 13 years that MMR vaccine is causally associated with autism and they have hidden it.
[00:02:03.144 --> 00:02:07.747]  From the public, from doctors, from public health officials, from everybody.
[00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:16.672]  They've kept it to an inner circle of people who knew the truth all along and have allowed millions of children to be put in harm's way in the interim.
[00:02:17.472 --> 00:02:19.533]  So you got whistleblowers from the inside of the U.S.
[00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:21.194]  coming out and saying these vaccines are dangerous.
[00:02:21.735 --> 00:02:24.716]  You've got Wakefield, who they always say has been discredited.
[00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:26.117]  You know, vaccines are perfectly safe.
[00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:27.398]  That research was bogus.
[00:02:28.038 --> 00:02:29.380]  That's all a PR hoax.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:39.872]  So they're doubling and tripling down with forced inoculations, with the claim that it's going to be the law that you've got to take shots, and they're adding hundreds of new vaccines.
[00:02:39.932 --> 00:02:42.576]  See, 30, 40 years ago, you only got five or six vaccines.
[00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:43.477]  Now it's over 50.
[00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:45.159]  They want it to be over 100.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.326]  Autism has gone from 1 in 25,000 30 years ago to 1 in less than 60.
[00:02:51.586 --> 00:02:55.230]  It's projected by 2025 to be 1 out of 10.
[00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.492]  This is the big global crisis.
[00:02:57.853 --> 00:02:59.114]  This is about medical tyranny.
[00:02:59.154 --> 00:03:02.438]  Now the big pharma complex is striking back.
[00:03:02.878 --> 00:03:04.180]  They've doubled and tripled down.
[00:03:05.262 --> 00:03:17.797]  We the people need to strike back and everyone who has been vaccine damaged or whose children have been vaccine damaged needs to go to YouTube and other platforms and do a testimonial video.
[00:03:19.078 --> 00:03:22.582]  And I suggest you use your name, your information, you show pictures of your children.
[00:03:23.447 --> 00:03:27.650]  We need to warn others so that they understand just how dangerous this is.
[00:03:28.171 --> 00:03:32.394]  Because with my uncle that almost got killed with a tetanus shot, they told him, yeah, the shot did it.
[00:03:32.674 --> 00:03:33.255]  The doctors did.
[00:03:33.775 --> 00:03:36.017]  With Marcos Morales, our live news director.
[00:03:37.458 --> 00:03:39.479]  Same thing happened to his child.
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.701]  And the doctor admitted it to him.
[00:03:43.502 --> 00:03:44.923]  But they want to isolate us.
[00:03:45.043 --> 00:03:46.244]  They want to keep us quiet.
[00:03:46.565 --> 00:03:48.026]  They want to arrest us.
[00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:51.969]  They want to publish our names and shame us.
[00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:59.273]  Like we're in a sex child registry or something because we're speaking out against vaccines or don't take vaccines.
[00:03:59.634 --> 00:04:01.175]  None of my three children have been vaccinated.
[00:04:01.916 --> 00:04:16.652]  And it's because I have so many friends and family who have 10, 15, 20 year old children that are still in diapers, screaming and yelling in pain every day with incredible intestinal problems from the vaccines and
[00:04:18.063 --> 00:04:20.224]  There's going to be more and more victims now.
[00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:24.467]  We've got to not just sit here quietly while this holocaust goes on.
[00:04:24.487 --> 00:04:26.348]  This is a do or die moment.
[00:04:26.408 --> 00:04:30.871]  It's absolutely crucial in the history of this country and indeed the world of who prevails.
[00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:32.833]  Who do your children actually belong to?
[00:04:33.633 --> 00:04:44.865]  And if we do not get William Thompson before a congressional series of committees that unearth the precise nature and extent of the fraud at the CDC and how they- That's the big whistleblower.
[00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:46.146]  That is the big whistleblower.
[00:04:46.767 --> 00:04:51.332]  Then, if we do not do that, and if we lose this battle, your children, you,
[00:04:51.932 --> 00:04:56.196]  Will be owned by the pharmaceutical industry and your children and your children's children.
[00:04:56.216 --> 00:04:56.577]  Slavery!
[00:04:56.837 --> 00:05:00.420]  And they are simply a marketplace for those companies.
[00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:09.328]  They are quantified in terms of vaccination for every birth in how much revenue they will generate for the pharmaceutical industry in a mandated program.
[00:05:10.327 --> 00:05:16.471]  For which there is no real recourse to any kind of compensational litigation if your children are harmed.
[00:05:16.491 --> 00:05:21.794]  So they want to take away your rights as to whether your children should be vaccinated or not, according to your decision.
[00:05:22.274 --> 00:05:30.299]  But if your child is harmed and vaccines are, according to the Supreme Court, unavoidably unsafe, then you are left to pick up the pieces.
[00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:37.583]  The inserts are clear that it can give you diabetes, Guillain-BarrÃ©, narcolepsy, death.
[00:05:38.717 --> 00:05:39.578]  Pancreatitis.
[00:05:40.418 --> 00:05:46.142]  Everything that we know is happening to the children is all in the insert.
[00:05:46.802 --> 00:05:49.204]  But the news will never tell you about these.
[00:05:49.244 --> 00:05:52.766]  Now, the reason we're doing this special report is it hit me.
[00:05:53.326 --> 00:05:58.450]  I was back in the control room talking to Marcos Morales and others about the scourge of vaccines.
[00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.514]  He was shaking his head and he said, yeah, I really don't want to talk about this, but Darren McBrain says I really should.
[00:06:05.774 --> 00:06:08.016]  My first child,
[00:06:09.346 --> 00:06:10.347]  Well, he's gonna tell you the story.
[00:06:11.348 --> 00:06:21.137]  Got the vaccines, they gave her a whole bunch at once, and it was incredibly painful, and she got incredibly sick, and the doctor told him, oh, that's just normal.
[00:06:21.537 --> 00:06:23.299]  They don't even deny it now.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.926]  And what's happening is, there's brain inflammation, IQ is being damaged, and girls are tougher than boys, genetically.
[00:06:31.106 --> 00:06:32.507]  Any doctor will tell you that.
[00:06:32.548 --> 00:06:34.850]  That's why 80 plus percent of the autistic children are boys.
[00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:37.209]  But he has daughters.
[00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:41.630]  So Marcos is going to tell you a story because he's reluctant, but he says he needs to do it.
[00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.451]  He wants to do it.
[00:06:42.751 --> 00:06:50.533]  He's a behind-the-scenes guy because he wants to warn you to know the facts and to not believe the mainstream media, the Brian Williams types.
[00:06:51.133 --> 00:06:55.714]  And then I want to challenge everybody out there, again, who's been damaged or who's had problems.
[00:06:56.604 --> 00:06:57.925]  To tell your story.
[00:06:58.225 --> 00:06:58.605]  Be heard.
[00:06:58.665 --> 00:07:01.607]  Say, we're not intimidated by Big Pharma and by the PR firms.
[00:07:01.867 --> 00:07:02.668]  We're standing up.
[00:07:02.748 --> 00:07:03.668]  We're taking action.
[00:07:03.988 --> 00:07:07.010]  And good people inside government and corporations are going public.
[00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:13.234]  And everything that Alex Jones and Wakefield and Dr. Blaylock and countless other people have said, it turns out, is accurate.
[00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:17.296]  I mean, even Harvard studies admit that fluoride's lowering IQs.
[00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:20.898]  But they don't want you to read the fine print, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:23.340]  But they legally have to tell you this.
[00:07:24.534 --> 00:07:29.897]  But when you go get your shots, they're not offering it to you, because it comes with the ampule itself, the multi-dose vial.
[00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:40.223]  So again, we're going to launch a whole initiative, and we're going to air some of these on air on the radio and TV shows, so that other people will start a chain reaction of telling their stories.
[00:07:41.254 --> 00:07:42.295]  They want to keep us quiet.
[00:07:43.015 --> 00:07:45.457]  And that's why they know that people are waking up to them.
[00:07:45.777 --> 00:07:53.263]  So they're really pushing now, that's their answer, to shutting down this avalanche of truth that's hitting them.
[00:07:53.663 --> 00:07:56.525]  Marcos, first off, you've been here on what, three and a half years?
[00:07:56.545 --> 00:07:58.066]  About three and a half years, yes.
[00:07:58.146 --> 00:07:59.287]  Since the launch of the Nightly News.
[00:07:59.527 --> 00:08:00.508]  Well, you're a good friend of mine.
[00:08:00.548 --> 00:08:01.849]  I'm over here customarily
[00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.453]  Ranting, but how could we not rant knowing this and seeing this huge push?
[00:08:07.894 --> 00:08:10.596]  First off, what do you make of all the stuff we're seeing in the media?
[00:08:10.896 --> 00:08:16.940]  The talk of publishing names, arresting people, the bullying, the terrorist tactics, and then tell us the story.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.522]  I mean, your wife's a nurse.
[00:08:18.582 --> 00:08:21.244]  Tell us the story of your oldest child and what happened.
[00:08:21.744 --> 00:08:30.511]  Well, one of the problems with the propaganda in the public these days is that it's turning a lot of people's minds into buying into it.
[00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:44.523]  I know people who were deftly against the transvaginal ultrasound when they were trying to regulate it, under the guise of, I didn't want the government putting something in my body that I didn't want there.
[00:08:45.751 --> 00:08:48.753]  And these same people are for forced vaccinations.
[00:08:49.334 --> 00:08:51.735]  And I would tell them, you can't take that out of your body.
[00:08:51.996 --> 00:08:55.818]  You're for the government putting something in your body when you can't take it out.
[00:08:55.959 --> 00:09:00.122]  And this is the government being able to put in our body whatever they want, these so-called vaccines.
[00:09:00.662 --> 00:09:01.943]  And they've got liability protection.
[00:09:01.963 --> 00:09:02.924]  I mean, how creepy is that?
[00:09:03.504 --> 00:09:04.065]  It's creepy.
[00:09:04.265 --> 00:09:08.651]  And my way to fight back, as you said, I'm reluctant to be on camera.
[00:09:09.011 --> 00:09:10.413]  I'm behind the camera talent, usually.
[00:09:10.573 --> 00:09:14.278]  But hopefully you'll spur others to have the courage because we've got to stand up for these children.
[00:09:14.438 --> 00:09:17.182]  My way to fight back was I would give people factual information.
[00:09:17.202 --> 00:09:20.226]  I would give them the articles with the studies, the data.
[00:09:22.248 --> 00:09:26.530]  Nothing really rang true with him unless my personal side came out.
[00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:35.215]  And then I would say, well, you know, when my first child came, the second time we visited the doctor, we went a little later than our date.
[00:09:36.428 --> 00:09:41.992]  We were gonna, the doctor said that we had to put four vaccines in that day because I missed the other two.
[00:09:42.692 --> 00:09:44.893]  And I was, you know, I was a first time parent.
[00:09:45.294 --> 00:09:46.434]  I had no idea what I was doing.
[00:09:46.474 --> 00:09:48.035]  I didn't do my homework, obviously.
[00:09:48.596 --> 00:09:50.577]  And so I went along with it.
[00:09:50.897 --> 00:09:55.120]  And then that night, my wife was working overnights at the time.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.802]  So I had my daughter by myself and she just, just,
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:58.980]  I don't know.
[00:10:20.765 --> 00:10:23.047]  I was told that it was fine, that it was normal.
[00:10:23.367 --> 00:10:24.407]  This is a normal reaction.
[00:10:24.908 --> 00:10:28.470]  So I had to get the doctor on the phone and tell them this was happening.
[00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.211]  My daughter is having this adverse reaction.
[00:10:30.251 --> 00:10:34.174]  The hospital says that's what happens when you get vaccines and the doctor confirmed it.
[00:10:34.414 --> 00:10:35.975]  Yeah, no, this is a normal reaction.
[00:10:36.255 --> 00:10:36.956]  Including death.
[00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:41.980]  And so I said, well if that's a normal reaction, then I'm not doing that ever again to my child.
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:47.004]  She suffered for almost three days, inconsolable, to the point where she couldn't cry anymore.
[00:10:47.144 --> 00:10:52.869]  Her tears were dried up, her body was worn out, and she just whimpered and laid there.
[00:10:53.069 --> 00:11:01.016]  For those that don't know, when adults are given a bunch of shots at once, the military, I've talked to troops that have described it, when they're given like three or four shots at once,
[00:11:01.796 --> 00:11:05.218]  Burning, uncontrollable migraine headache.
[00:11:05.658 --> 00:11:06.979]  And that's why you see these kids.
[00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:08.480]  Rob Dew was telling the story.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.441]  In fact, I didn't even tell him I was going to do this.
[00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:11.721]  Somebody go grab Rob, bring him in here.
[00:11:11.741 --> 00:11:15.643]  Because we're having these behind-the-scenes discussions that are so real they would wake people up.
[00:11:16.324 --> 00:11:19.866]  He'll be at the playground and see like some two-year-old flipping out, acting crazy, one of his neighbors.
[00:11:20.286 --> 00:11:21.186]  And they go, I don't know what happened.
[00:11:21.206 --> 00:11:22.847]  She's never acted like this or he's never acted like this.
[00:11:23.207 --> 00:11:24.288]  And Rob goes, did you go to the doctor?
[00:11:24.608 --> 00:11:26.609]  They're like, yeah, we went yesterday.
[00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:27.769]  Did you get shots?
[00:11:27.809 --> 00:11:29.250]  They're like, how did you know?
[00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:40.155]  Because we know, and until a few years ago, if your daughter would have had convulsions, they would have taken her from you, or if she had died, they would have indicted you, because they do a CAT scan, blood on the brain.
[00:11:40.195 --> 00:11:42.756]  Your daughter had a huge autoimmune response.
[00:11:42.896 --> 00:11:45.697]  I'm not a brain surgeon, Dr. Blalock is and exposes that.
[00:11:46.578 --> 00:11:48.418]  I guess, talking to his mic, Robert.
[00:11:48.839 --> 00:11:49.859]  It's the new normal now.
[00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:54.001]  You know, your kid's flailing on the playground, and she's kind of laughing about it, going,
[00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:55.602]  Oh, we don't know what's wrong.
[00:11:55.902 --> 00:11:56.382]  Uh-huh.
[00:11:56.802 --> 00:11:58.883]  And I just go, well, did y'all just go to the doctor?
[00:11:58.903 --> 00:12:01.525]  She goes, yeah, we took her last week.
[00:12:01.685 --> 00:12:03.826]  She just got back from, you know, she went to the doctor last week.
[00:12:04.426 --> 00:12:05.146]  Oh, okay.
[00:12:05.987 --> 00:12:07.448]  And I said, has she ever acted like that before?
[00:12:07.528 --> 00:12:09.148]  No, this is the first time she's started acting like this.
[00:12:09.408 --> 00:12:10.109]  Two-year-old baby.
[00:12:10.834 --> 00:12:12.776]  And you told the rest of the story, you asked about vaccines?
[00:12:12.996 --> 00:12:15.798]  Yeah, well, and then I said, is she getting all of her shots?
[00:12:15.878 --> 00:12:17.860]  And they're like, oh yeah, she's right on schedule.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:25.947]  So it's the fact that the parents don't even see the connection between the bad behavior, because she's never acted like this before.
[00:12:26.268 --> 00:12:28.750]  She'd just gone to the doctor, and this is what happens.
[00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:34.995]  I've looked at studies of people that said the vaccines are safe, and in the epilogue, the doctor writes, I've taken
[00:12:36.416 --> 00:12:40.559]  My first two kids, they both had seizures after the shot.
[00:12:40.819 --> 00:12:44.121]  But I'm going to take my third one to get the shot, and I'm going to give them Tylenol beforehand.
[00:12:44.501 --> 00:12:45.902]  That's their solution.
[00:12:45.922 --> 00:12:47.563]  And here's the deal, because these aren't vaccines.
[00:12:47.964 --> 00:12:54.067]  They're adding brain-altering systems, the anti-stress type vaccines that are viruses.
[00:12:54.428 --> 00:12:56.949]  We'll put the articles up that go in and actually eat part of the brain.
[00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:58.810]  This is population control.
[00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:59.851]  It's what's in eco-science.
[00:12:59.951 --> 00:13:03.934]  And it's so big that they may win, because it's so over the top.
[00:13:04.634 --> 00:13:05.394]  How do you deal with this?
[00:13:05.434 --> 00:13:10.176]  How do you deal with 1 in 25,000 having autism 30 years ago, and now it's 1 in 50-something?
[00:13:10.496 --> 00:13:17.058]  How do you deal with the magnitude of... My mother almost died from a flu shot.
[00:13:17.558 --> 00:13:21.100]  The thing is, you said the doctor said, this is normal.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.260]  See, that's the new thing.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.461]  Because they'll say on the news, no side effects, no problem.
[00:13:24.661 --> 00:13:27.162]  But you go, hey doctor, it says it could make me have convulsions.
[00:13:28.428 --> 00:13:30.571]  Uh, destroy my pancreas and give me diabetes.
[00:13:30.651 --> 00:13:31.311]  It says it all right here.
[00:13:31.331 --> 00:13:32.012]  They're like, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:32.032 --> 00:13:33.213]  Pneumonia?
[00:13:33.374 --> 00:13:34.495]  Pneumonia is one of the side effects?
[00:13:34.975 --> 00:13:35.216]  You know?
[00:13:35.576 --> 00:13:36.957]  Get measles from the measles shop.
[00:13:37.018 --> 00:13:37.939]  People spreading the measles.
[00:13:37.979 --> 00:13:39.160]  Most of them have had shots.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.505]  And they'll say in the back of the paper, yeah, we don't know why people are getting the flu shot and then dying of the flu.
[00:13:44.588 --> 00:13:48.512]  Yeah, of the same strain that they're supposedly vaccinated against.
[00:13:48.712 --> 00:13:53.857]  The same exact strain that they're being injected with, they die from.
[00:13:53.897 --> 00:13:56.920]  I was talking to a globalist off-record once and they said, Alex, you don't understand.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.963]  You think people adapt and evolve.
[00:14:01.044 --> 00:14:01.785]  Adapt, overcome.
[00:14:01.805 --> 00:14:02.966]  You know, the military talks about
[00:14:04.437 --> 00:14:05.158]  It's a good thing.
[00:14:05.318 --> 00:14:10.101]  We use the public adapting to bad things and people will go along with it.
[00:14:10.522 --> 00:14:17.067]  And he sort of explained to me, basically laughing at me, when I was flying to New York once on a first class flight to be on The View.
[00:14:17.707 --> 00:14:18.648]  And I mean, I looked the guy up.
[00:14:18.708 --> 00:14:20.449]  He was like the head of a major bank.
[00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.532]  Not one of the big six, but one right tier below that.
[00:14:23.752 --> 00:14:26.293]  People don't understand this is a multi-generational attack.
[00:14:26.414 --> 00:14:30.416]  This is something that has been going on for about 60, 70 years.
[00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:34.678]  And they just keep, every year, they change the schedule, they up the dosage.
[00:14:35.098 --> 00:14:36.059]  And it's little bits.
[00:14:36.439 --> 00:14:38.941]  But we've seen, and it's happened really bad since the 80s.
[00:14:39.001 --> 00:14:43.823]  The late 80s, when Rain Man came out to normalize autism and make it seem like it's kind of cool.
[00:14:43.863 --> 00:14:45.144]  And they normalized breast cancer.
[00:14:45.404 --> 00:14:48.466]  Yeah, it's up 3-4 thousand percent, but we're having a run for it.
[00:14:48.786 --> 00:14:50.187]  We're not going to ask why it's increasing.
[00:14:50.487 --> 00:14:51.448]  It's up to you, folks.
[00:14:51.688 --> 00:14:52.688]  Robb Dew can't do it all.
[00:14:52.748 --> 00:14:53.949]  Marcos Morales can't do it all.
[00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:55.189]  Alex Jones can't do it all.
[00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:56.950]  Kit Daniels can't do it all.
[00:14:57.731 --> 00:14:59.291]  Don Salazar can't do it all.
[00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:08.356]  All our crew back there, John Bowne, Derek, we need you to tell your story, especially about the doctors admitting it.
[00:15:08.796 --> 00:15:18.080]  Because, I mean, my dad wouldn't vaccinate me, and he's an oral surgeon and a dentist and has a degree in chemistry and all this other stuff.
[00:15:19.838 --> 00:15:25.360]  He wouldn't do it because he said they usually don't protect you even though it's a clean vaccine and it lowers your immune system.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:30.742]  He said, I would only take it if there was something super deadly like polio running around and only if it was already rampant.
[00:15:30.762 --> 00:15:35.144]  But he goes, you know, your grandmother got polio from the polio shots.
[00:15:35.224 --> 00:15:35.824]  I went and asked her.
[00:15:36.445 --> 00:15:39.346]  She goes, yeah, I got it a month after she was given the shot.
[00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:45.034]  And then she got the strain she'd been vaccinated for a month later and is on crutches at age 89 today.
[00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:47.735]  So this affects me.
[00:15:48.275 --> 00:15:54.637]  My mother used to run triathlons, this was like 20 years ago, and they told everybody on the team, get your flu shot because we're having a triathlon come up next month.
[00:15:55.237 --> 00:15:56.978]  You know, she was on UT Master Swimming.
[00:15:57.458 --> 00:15:58.978]  She was in bed for like two weeks.
[00:15:59.618 --> 00:16:01.819]  Just almost killed her.
[00:16:02.159 --> 00:16:05.640]  My uncle, Joe Jones, almost killed him.
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:06.780]  The doctor said, yeah, you had a bad reaction.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.300]  He's had the shot.
[00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:08.821]  Face swoll up, hands swoll up.
[00:16:11.163 --> 00:16:11.904]  Everyone I know!
[00:16:11.984 --> 00:16:13.605]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:16:13.685 --> 00:16:20.170]  I haven't had the flu shot myself since high school, by the way, and I got the flu every year in high school that I got the flu shot.
[00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.913]  And then once I moved out, went to college, never took the flu shot again, I haven't had the flu since.
[00:16:25.593 --> 00:16:25.854]  I've had...
[00:16:30.137 --> 00:16:36.862]  It lowers your immunity by 50% for an entire year when you take the regular flu shot.
[00:16:37.283 --> 00:16:40.365]  It's up to you to call in the talk radio with your stories.
[00:16:40.425 --> 00:16:41.066]  It's up to you.
[00:16:41.466 --> 00:16:46.110]  If you don't know how to do a YouTube, go to your grandson or your neighbor or your brother.
[00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:46.890]  Do it!
[00:16:47.211 --> 00:16:47.691]  Speak out!
[00:16:47.871 --> 00:16:49.893]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.031]  I started 23 years ago trying to get on air.
[00:16:53.191 --> 00:16:54.432]  After three years, I got on air.
[00:16:54.512 --> 00:16:56.333]  Now I reach 20 million people a week, conservatively.
[00:16:56.934 --> 00:17:05.339]  And I just didn't like them trying to pass laws that under 18 couldn't shoot guns with their parents, couldn't go hunting, that they were trying to take people's private property.
[00:17:05.519 --> 00:17:06.500]  I never intended to be on air.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.920]  I never intended to do all this.
[00:17:08.081 --> 00:17:09.241]  I just went out there.
[00:17:09.982 --> 00:17:11.042]  And you can do it too.
[00:17:11.062 --> 00:17:12.583]  I'm not saying you want to go this far.
[00:17:12.643 --> 00:17:13.564]  Maybe some of you will go further.
[00:17:14.304 --> 00:17:15.765]  Just tell the story.
[00:17:15.945 --> 00:17:16.466]  And you know what?
[00:17:16.566 --> 00:17:18.187]  If vaccines have been great for you,
[00:17:19.434 --> 00:17:19.874]  Keep it up.
[00:17:20.354 --> 00:17:21.535]  Just enjoy yourself.
[00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:29.537]  But at least read the insert, because I'll be in a restaurant, and I will see someone with an air tank on, being wheeled in.
[00:17:29.557 --> 00:17:30.917]  It looks like they're about to die.
[00:17:30.997 --> 00:17:33.438]  And I saw this woman walk over to the other woman.
[00:17:33.458 --> 00:17:35.318]  She goes, Hi, how you doing, Blair?
[00:17:35.338 --> 00:17:36.439]  That was her name.
[00:17:37.439 --> 00:17:38.599]  Have you got your flu shot?
[00:17:38.619 --> 00:17:40.500]  She's like, yeah, I got my flu shot.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.040]  She's like 50 years old or something.
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:42.760]  She's about to die.
[00:17:43.301 --> 00:17:44.381]  And I'll be in a restaurant.
[00:17:44.401 --> 00:17:45.241]  It's like a cult now.
[00:17:45.321 --> 00:17:47.242]  All these really unhealthy-looking people.
[00:17:47.262 --> 00:17:48.402]  And they're like, yeah.
[00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:56.973]  I mean, it's just, they just think they're getting something, and they're like, doing what's right, not gonna get other people sick.
[00:17:57.013 --> 00:17:58.594]  Herd immunity, herd immunity.
[00:17:58.934 --> 00:17:59.554]  Herd immunity.
[00:17:59.874 --> 00:18:03.156]  The government, hello, is gonna force stuff in us.
[00:18:03.196 --> 00:18:04.357]  It's gonna start a civil war.
[00:18:04.477 --> 00:18:04.617]  Yeah.
[00:18:04.837 --> 00:18:11.301]  I've never called for violence, and I'm not calling for violence now, but it's violent to force something on people that we know hurts them.
[00:18:11.521 --> 00:18:15.904]  In India and Africa, everywhere else, they've caught the UN forcibly inoculating, sterilizing people.
[00:18:16.524 --> 00:18:18.946]  This is like coming at you with a gun, but it soft kills you.
[00:18:19.446 --> 00:18:25.352]  Okay, so, I'm not for offensive violence, but I'm telling you, they want to start a civil war, this is the way it's going to be.
[00:18:25.712 --> 00:18:34.480]  And the media people, and the bureaucrats, and the medical people, and the Rockefellers, and the Rothschilds, and Bill Gates up to this to his eyeballs, they're trying to make this forced.
[00:18:35.021 --> 00:18:37.623]  McDonald's giving out the free, you know, vaccines with Happy Meals.
[00:18:38.244 --> 00:18:39.905]  You are going to be held accountable.
[00:18:40.305 --> 00:18:43.729]  I know the Nazis got caught because they used guns, and everybody could see they were killing people.
[00:18:44.269 --> 00:18:46.030]  You just give us shots and we go off and die later.
[00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:50.111]  No, we know, we're ringing the alarm bell, and we know what you're doing.
[00:18:50.391 --> 00:18:51.171]  And I just want to say this.
[00:18:51.892 --> 00:18:52.752]  We're three dads here.
[00:18:52.792 --> 00:18:53.572]  We all have kids.
[00:18:54.373 --> 00:18:58.354]  And it's not that we're medical scientists, we're not professionals in the medical field.
[00:18:58.734 --> 00:19:05.436]  All we did, read the inserts, read the studies, read what other people have researched, and look at the connections.
[00:19:05.537 --> 00:19:06.697]  We're not doing anything spectacular.
[00:19:06.737 --> 00:19:08.337]  The doctor told you it was the vaccine!
[00:19:08.358 --> 00:19:09.418]  It was a normal response.
[00:19:09.978 --> 00:19:11.379]  And she came back, thank God.
[00:19:11.639 --> 00:19:12.439]  That was a lucky one.
[00:19:12.779 --> 00:19:12.999]  Absolutely.
[00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:13.919]  She would have been a boy, probably.
[00:19:13.999 --> 00:19:14.840]  I mean, autistic.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.360]  Could have been.
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:15.940]  Could have been.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:16.880]  Because boys can't handle it.
[00:19:18.801 --> 00:19:19.901]  It's so epic, though.
[00:19:19.961 --> 00:19:21.641]  I mean, it's so wild.
[00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:22.541]  It's biowarfare.
[00:19:22.902 --> 00:19:29.523]  We're undergoing biowarfare in the name of these giant pharmaceutical companies to make us customers for life.
[00:19:29.623 --> 00:19:32.464]  Because when you're debilitated by these, you may not have autism.
[00:19:32.664 --> 00:19:33.804]  You may have severe allergies.
[00:19:34.024 --> 00:19:35.265]  You may have Crohn's disease.
[00:19:35.585 --> 00:19:37.965]  How many people out there have Crohn's disease who also got their vaccine?
[00:19:37.985 --> 00:19:38.966]  And they never used to have that.
[00:19:39.206 --> 00:19:40.146]  All these new diseases.
[00:19:40.686 --> 00:19:41.526]  I don't know.
[00:20:01.112 --> 00:20:02.914]  We have a lot more money and we're going to destroy you.
[00:20:02.974 --> 00:20:03.634]  That's what they did.
[00:20:04.635 --> 00:20:05.816]  But he's rising like the Phoenix.
[00:20:05.856 --> 00:20:06.517]  He's been exonerated.
[00:20:06.757 --> 00:20:07.557]  Here's what we need to do.
[00:20:07.938 --> 00:20:10.480]  I want to make this a featured video on the YouTube channel.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.342]  I want it on InfoWars, Prison Planet, Facebook, Twitter.
[00:20:13.562 --> 00:20:16.285]  Because it seems like if there's something super important, it doesn't get pushed.
[00:20:16.725 --> 00:20:18.947]  And I want this video to get out there.
[00:20:18.987 --> 00:20:20.728]  Folks, we can do it together.
[00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:22.190]  Tell your testimony.
[00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:23.291]  Expose what's happening.
[00:20:23.671 --> 00:20:24.431]  Band together.
[00:20:25.632 --> 00:20:26.934]  And let your doctor know.
[00:20:27.334 --> 00:20:28.155]  What my dad says is,
[00:20:29.221 --> 00:20:32.184]  Go in with a consent form to them saying they'll take responsibility.
[00:20:32.324 --> 00:20:32.545]  Right.
[00:20:32.945 --> 00:20:42.175]  When the school lies to you and says it's the law, see they're liars, say here, sign this consent form that you waive any liability for me and that you'll pay for everything.
[00:20:42.395 --> 00:20:43.096]  They won't do it.
[00:20:43.877 --> 00:20:50.624]  This is how you take down a society, how you medicalize the culture, how you make everybody sick, and then the socialist healthcare of government comes in
[00:20:51.644 --> 00:20:56.908]  Federalizing everything to basically reclimate and tear down the system.
[00:20:57.348 --> 00:21:00.811]  This is the military attack on America and the rest of the world.
[00:21:00.851 --> 00:21:04.213]  This is the heart of their program and it's why they're pushing so hard right now.
[00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:06.134]  So get your testimony out today.
[00:21:07.135 --> 00:21:07.735]  Take action.
[00:21:07.755 --> 00:21:08.556]  Write articles.
[00:21:08.936 --> 00:21:10.317]  Post it on your Facebook, Twitter.
[00:21:10.737 --> 00:21:15.321]  However you want to communicate, get your stories out and keep telling them.
[00:21:15.481 --> 00:21:16.702]  Because I read on our YouTubes
[00:21:17.774 --> 00:21:23.737]  Uh, you know, people that have been damaged are just annihilating the trolls because they're like, hey, listen, my son's brain damage after the shot.
[00:21:23.757 --> 00:21:24.257]  They admitted it.
[00:21:24.317 --> 00:21:25.117]  We settled in court.
[00:21:25.437 --> 00:21:27.338]  I mean, it's just bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[00:21:27.398 --> 00:21:30.539]  I mean, this is real and this could bring down the entire new world order.
[00:21:30.599 --> 00:21:38.803]  Since, since the late eighties, Alex, the vaccine company, the vaccine court has paid out over $2.6 billion in damages to people.
[00:21:38.883 --> 00:21:40.524]  They're so safe and effective.
[00:21:40.644 --> 00:21:42.364]  It wouldn't be, they wouldn't be paying out $2.6 billion.
[00:21:43.985 --> 00:21:44.265]  Okay?
[00:21:44.726 --> 00:21:45.947]  It's not safe and effective.
[00:21:46.327 --> 00:21:47.588]  It is a chemical attack.
[00:21:48.228 --> 00:21:53.292]  Chemical bio-warfare from the same government that used to just shoot the blacks up with syphilis straight away.
[00:21:53.432 --> 00:21:57.115]  And don't, and dads out there, you're going to get this information.
[00:21:57.155 --> 00:22:03.480]  We have a lot more male viewers than females and you're going to go up against your wives who have been programmed to accept the medical tyranny.
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.122]  You have to do your education and be patient.
[00:22:06.542 --> 00:22:07.303]  It does work.
[00:22:07.603 --> 00:22:08.924]  If you keep giving them the facts,
[00:22:09.304 --> 00:22:10.465]  You can turn this around.
[00:22:10.766 --> 00:22:13.488]  You can even convince your doctor that what they're doing is wrong.
[00:22:13.508 --> 00:22:14.069]  We need to get serious.
[00:22:14.089 --> 00:22:19.895]  I mean, people almost need to get FM transmitters that broadcast over a neighborhood and just run this in a loop for five years.
[00:22:20.315 --> 00:22:21.076]  No, I'm serious.
[00:22:21.136 --> 00:22:25.841]  I mean, we need to get hardcore with these people because when you realize all the secret testing our government did,
[00:22:26.021 --> 00:22:26.201]  Yeah.
[00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:31.043]  And how they set up the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and said they'd put stuff in vaccines, Bertrand Russell, all of them.
[00:22:31.323 --> 00:22:32.063]  They're doing it.
[00:22:32.163 --> 00:22:32.363]  Yeah.
[00:22:32.483 --> 00:22:34.024]  They are really doing it.
[00:22:34.364 --> 00:22:35.685]  Alright folks, it's up to you.
[00:22:35.965 --> 00:22:36.965]  We're taking action as well.
[00:22:36.985 --> 00:22:37.705]  We're all together.
[00:22:38.025 --> 00:22:40.566]  Join us in warning the parents out there.
[00:22:42.287 --> 00:22:45.531]  I'm going to warn people all the time I hear about other medical tyranny.
[00:22:45.551 --> 00:22:48.874]  We're going to start on a bunch of issues, getting people to tell their stories.
[00:22:49.155 --> 00:22:50.456]  That's how we're going to stop this evil.
[00:22:50.736 --> 00:22:53.119]  I'm Alex Jones signing off for the Whole Info Wars crew.
[00:22:53.519 --> 00:22:54.180]  Please spread the word.
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.664]  Get this video out to everyone you know, because truth is powerful.
[00:22:58.044 --> 00:23:01.989]  And as V for Vendetta says, ideas are bulletproof.
