[00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.832]  Advising the Congress of the State of the Union is a constitutional requirement.
[00:00:04.492 --> 00:00:07.074]  And for most of the history of this country, it was done very simply.
[00:00:07.134 --> 00:00:15.221]  But under FDR, it became a public event, and now it's become a massive PR stunt, a massive commercial for the President.
[00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:28.451]  Now, Obama took this to all new levels last night as he did a live PowerPoint presentation, twisting the statistics, twisting the facts to present a case that we have never been more prosperous or more peaceful.
[00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:33.749]  We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet.
[00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.631]  And today, America is number one in oil and gas.
[00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:48.734]  But the broad themes that he's been talking about all week were redistribution of wealth from the rich to the middle class and, of course, two years of community college free for everyone.
[00:00:49.254 --> 00:00:54.056]  Noticeably absent from the State of the Union were any details about his policy proposals.
[00:00:54.656 --> 00:00:58.240]  But the devil is in the details, and so are the lies.
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.925]  As we'll see from the details, both the redistribution and the free college themes are lies.
[00:01:04.406 --> 00:01:10.732]  But there are two other areas that haven't been looked at as closely, and they will change the world that you live in.
[00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:16.198]  That's the trade treaties that are currently being negotiated secretly and fast-tracked.
[00:01:16.878 --> 00:01:21.462]  And the control of the Internet and new draconian felonies for the Internet.
[00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:22.823]  First, the lies.
[00:01:23.263 --> 00:01:27.606]  He will make two years of college as free and as universal as high school.
[00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:36.013]  But if you look beyond the headline of the White House press release, you'll see that he's only proposing 75% of the tuition be paid by the federal government.
[00:01:36.373 --> 00:01:38.155]  So he's lying when he says it's free.
[00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:45.820]  Now, of course, there's no such thing as a free lunch or a free government education unless you've never paid property taxes and never will.
[00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:52.708]  Anybody who has paid property taxes knows that it is by far the largest part of your local taxes.
[00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:59.096]  If you don't pay them directly, if you rent from someone, you're not going to see those costs, but they are in the cost of your rent.
[00:01:59.656 --> 00:02:06.444]  But the thing that I find most troubling is that while on the one hand Obama is lying about a free government education,
[00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:12.470]  He is also taking with the other hand the middle class's education savings accounts.
[00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.893]  The government has offered the middle class a couple of ways that parents can save for their children's education.
[00:02:17.434 --> 00:02:29.444]  Saving after-tax dollars into an education fund, and if that fund grows in value because of the investment, the gain will not be taxed when they apply it to their children's education.
[00:02:30.064 --> 00:02:32.887]  Now Obama is proposing to tax those plans.
[00:02:32.907 --> 00:02:38.793]  They're called 529 plans and also to end the Coverdale Education Savings Account.
[00:02:39.494 --> 00:02:44.479]  Now that punishes families that save money to invest in their children's education.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:56.824]  And most importantly, it betrays those who have worked hard, who have saved, who have relied on the government promise that the education savings would not be stolen by the taxman.
[00:02:57.345 --> 00:03:02.547]  This is really about punishing self-reliance and fostering a dependence on the state.
[00:03:03.147 --> 00:03:10.590]  And Obama has the audacity to say that he's taxing the rich, going after trust funds, helping the middle class.
[00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.340]  This is a massive betrayal of the middle class, if it were to pass.
[00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:18.468]  These education accounts are not trust funds.
[00:03:19.312 --> 00:03:21.413]  The average for the accounts is $21,000.
[00:03:21.473 --> 00:03:28.716]  This is not a Bill Gates trust fund and $21,000 isn't very much when you're trying to pay for college.
[00:03:29.437 --> 00:03:31.177]  Obama is not taking trust funds.
[00:03:31.738 --> 00:03:40.422]  What he is doing is betraying the trust of the middle class who thought that they would have a little bit of an opportunity to save for their children's education.
[00:03:40.822 --> 00:03:42.623]  But these proposals are not likely to pass.
[00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:50.127]  What is going to pass will change your world, whether you are working class, middle class, or rich, and not for the better.
[00:03:50.427 --> 00:04:00.252]  If you want to know how much Obama really cares about the middle class and the working class, look carefully at the trade agreement that he's trying to fast-track with the help of the Republicans.
[00:04:00.693 --> 00:04:03.094]  Huffington Post asks, is this schizophrenia?
[00:04:03.234 --> 00:04:08.217]  Saying you're going to help the middle class while you destroy jobs by fast-tracking the TPP?
[00:04:08.637 --> 00:04:10.238]  No, it's not schizophrenia.
[00:04:10.658 --> 00:04:11.999]  It's simply a lie.
[00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:18.183]  But the Huffington Post and the liberal mainstream media can't bring themselves to call Obama a liar.
[00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:21.306]  Look at what the Guardian says without a hint of sarcasm.
[00:04:21.526 --> 00:04:29.332]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a trade agreement so significant and important its details can't be disclosed.
[00:04:29.672 --> 00:04:30.293]  Are you kidding me?
[00:04:31.013 --> 00:04:34.376]  I guess if we knew the secret details, they'd have to kill us.
[00:04:35.117 --> 00:04:41.502]  Anything that is that important, that significant, needs to be transparent and debated in public.
[00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:43.123]  But they're not about to do that.
[00:04:43.484 --> 00:04:48.408]  The liberal mainstream media wants to dance around the central issue of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:04:48.428 --> 00:04:53.232]  And that is, it's the next step in global corporate governance.
[00:04:53.712 --> 00:05:01.096]  Why isn't it a screaming red flag to them that no elected representatives can see the content of these secret treaties?
[00:05:01.557 --> 00:05:06.600]  Only multinational corporate lobbyists who are writing the treaty know what's in it.
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.462]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Agreement go far beyond trade.
[00:05:11.502 --> 00:05:13.844]  They rewrite copyright laws globally
[00:05:14.204 --> 00:05:25.448]  They affect the freedom of the Internet, and they bypass our legal systems, giving special privileges to multinational corporations that neither individuals nor even domestic corporations have.
[00:05:25.788 --> 00:05:32.651]  Fast Track will not only rush the treaty through without public debate, it will block any and all changes to the document.
[00:05:33.471 --> 00:05:36.552]  Nothing should ever be passed this way.
[00:05:37.312 --> 00:05:51.235]  Now, the fact that the only thing we know for sure about the Trans-Pacific Partnership is what has been leaked by WikiLeaks is, I think, very telling, and the reason that Obama is going after the Internet in his fourth leg of his agenda.
[00:05:51.495 --> 00:05:55.356]  He's calling for total Internet control and draconian new felonies for the Internet.
[00:05:55.776 --> 00:06:00.657]  It's a multi-pronged attack against Internet freedom, regulatory control by the FCC,
[00:06:01.417 --> 00:06:05.399]  Corporations spying on you and reporting to the government, which they call CISPA.
[00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:09.581]  New crimes and draconian penalties for the new crimes.
[00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:15.084]  Remember what I just said about the education proposals, where the feds would give with one hand and take with the other?
[00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:25.189]  Now they're telling us, well, you can have net neutrality, but that's going to come through the FCC being appointed as king of the Internet, as the regulator of the Internet.
[00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:27.890]  Now, of course, we've always had net neutrality.
[00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.370]  We didn't need the FCC for that.
[00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.431]  And the FCC has been on both sides of net neutrality.
[00:06:33.911 --> 00:06:35.412]  It isn't about net neutrality.
[00:06:35.452 --> 00:06:43.554]  Whatever you think about it, it's all about giving the FCC control of the Internet, making them the regulators of the Internet.
[00:06:43.914 --> 00:06:48.295]  And once they are, they can change net neutrality in a heartbeat.
[00:06:48.496 --> 00:06:49.476]  Then there's CISPA.
[00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:53.940]  Cyber Intelligence Sharing Protection Act.
[00:06:54.441 --> 00:07:01.950]  Every time Obama talks about the Internet, he now talks about cyber intelligence sharing, especially since the Sony hack involving the interview.
[00:07:02.611 --> 00:07:09.179]  CISPA's primary function is to grant legal immunity to corporations that turn all of your data over to the government.
[00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:11.840]  Well of course they've been doing that for quite some time.
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.961]  It's not about protecting you.
[00:07:14.341 --> 00:07:20.003]  It's all about giving these snitches legal protection and removing your right to sue them.
[00:07:20.343 --> 00:07:24.824]  CISPA has been defeated twice, but the Republicans love it and so does Obama.
[00:07:25.325 --> 00:07:28.926]  Now it looks like this Orwellian love child is going to be birthed.
[00:07:29.386 --> 00:07:33.451]  Then there's the changes to the CFAA, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
[00:07:33.672 --> 00:07:42.843]  That's the one the federal prosecutor tried to use against the leader of the opposition to CISPA, Aaron Schwartz, to try to send him to jail for 35 years.
[00:07:43.144 --> 00:07:46.808]  But even that grotesque abuse of power was not enough for Obama.
[00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:49.570]  He wants to turn misdemeanors into felonies.
[00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.431]  He wants to quadruple jail sentences.
[00:07:51.751 --> 00:07:55.292]  He wants to use RICO statutes against Anonymous.
[00:07:55.633 --> 00:08:08.778]  Wired Magazine points out that bringing in RICO could mean that a member of Anonymous busted in a petty denial-of-service attack might be held legally responsible for every cybercrime they attribute to Anonymous.
[00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:12.020]  Well, that's one way to make sure their secret treaties don't get exposed.
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:22.327]  But we need whistleblowers, we even need hackers, when nearly everything the government does is a secretive criminal conspiracy, like these trade treaties.
[00:08:22.567 --> 00:08:27.590]  But even white hat hackers would be affected by Obama's overreach with the expanded CFAA.
[00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:39.835]  If someone were to discover a security hole in a piece of software and publicizes it, as is frequently done so that the public is aware of the vulnerability and can protect themselves and even hopefully the developer will fix it.
[00:08:40.355 --> 00:08:48.858]  With Obama's proposal, if someone exploited the vulnerability criminally, the Feds could come after the white hat who warned the people.
[00:08:49.878 --> 00:08:54.620]  Now going back to these trade treaties, the Pacific and Atlantic partnerships as they call them.
[00:08:55.697 --> 00:09:05.623]  These are really a means of extending these bad laws, like CISPA, like the CFAA, these bad American laws, extending them internationally.
[00:09:06.464 --> 00:09:07.945]  You want to know what the State of the Union is?
[00:09:08.805 --> 00:09:10.166]  It's a criminal cabal.
