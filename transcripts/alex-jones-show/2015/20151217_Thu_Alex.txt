[00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.254]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:16.411]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:17.071]  Mainstream.
[00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:18.092]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:19.932]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:20.592]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.612 --> 00:00:21.412]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.432 --> 00:00:22.353]  So do the people.
[00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:24.073]  So does he.
[00:00:24.093 --> 00:00:27.374]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:32.015]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:33.495]  Merry Christmas, folks.
[00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:34.836]  Gotta be politically incorrect.
[00:00:34.976 --> 00:00:38.297]  Even such simple things like that are sacrilege under the New World Order.
[00:00:38.797 --> 00:00:39.477]  Putin's called.
[00:00:40.703 --> 00:00:42.103]  Trump, an absolute leader.
[00:00:42.123 --> 00:00:43.604]  That'd be good for Russia.
[00:00:44.524 --> 00:00:48.946]  We've got incredible information with Muslims murdering gays in Europe.
[00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:50.366]  The liberals seem to love it.
[00:00:51.306 --> 00:00:52.467]  It's totally insane.
[00:00:52.507 --> 00:00:54.788]  We've got so much big news and world events.
[00:00:54.808 --> 00:01:01.770]  But here's John Bowne on the connection to Obama and ISIS and Al Qaeda as the curtain comes down.
[00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:17.719]  Filed under what's old is new again are the alarming steps Michael Springman, a high-level State Department official, took to inform the federal government that unqualified foreign applicants were being issued visas prior to 9-11.
[00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:28.707]  In Saudi Arabia, I was repeatedly ordered by high-level State Department officials to issue visas to unqualified applicants, Springman told the BBC prior to the 9-11 attack.
[00:01:29.608 --> 00:01:35.453]  These were essentially people who had no ties either to Saudi Arabia or to their own country.
[00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:37.474]  I complained bitterly at the time there.
[00:01:37.694 --> 00:01:38.795]  I returned to the U.S.
[00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:45.981]  I complained to the State Department here, to the General Accounting Office, to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, and to the Inspector General's office.
[00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:47.802]  I was met with silence.
[00:01:48.603 --> 00:01:53.387]  Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make.
[00:01:54.788 --> 00:01:58.551]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:01:59.918 --> 00:02:06.987]  Fast forward approximately 15 years later and Obama sounds like a broken record being played in an empty hall.
[00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:15.657]  Meanwhile here at home, the Department of Homeland Security is updating its alert system to help the American people stay vigilant and safe.
[00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:22.749]  And as always, our extraordinary men and women in uniform continue to put their lives on the line.
[00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:33.656]  Meanwhile, the Mirror UK reports, hackers have claimed that a number of Islamic State supporters' social media accounts are being run from internet addresses linked to the Department of Work and Pensions.
[00:02:34.096 --> 00:02:42.501]  The hacking collective showed Mirror Online details of the IP addresses used by a trio of separate digital jihadis to access Twitter accounts.
[00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:47.462]  Which were then used to carry out online recruitment and propaganda campaigns.
[00:02:47.782 --> 00:02:58.825]  At first glance, the IP addresses seem to be based in Saudi Arabia, but upon further inspection using specialist tools, they appeared to link back to the Department of Work and Pensions.
[00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:08.108]  The British government has admitted selling large numbers of internet addresses to Saudi Arabia, but has refused to reveal how much it has earned from the transaction.
[00:03:08.368 --> 00:03:19.579]  Although the government announced plans to auction its surplus IP numbers, it can now be revealed that a chunk of them went to Saudi Telecom and the Saudi-based mobile telecommunications company.
[00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.464]  Of course, the inept, record-breaking, tax-sucking behemoth known as the U.S.
[00:03:24.524 --> 00:03:31.211]  federal government, with all of its trillions spent on surveilling the average American's phone calls, emails, and browser history,
[00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:41.896]  And storing it all in a huge database guarded by psychotic thugs can't be bothered with monitoring the social media of potential terrorists entering the United States.
[00:03:42.316 --> 00:03:48.680]  The Hill reports Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson decided against ending a secret U.S.
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.260]  policy.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.105]  That prohibits immigration officials from reviewing social media posts of foreigners applying for US visas.
[00:03:56.365 --> 00:04:05.392]  A DHS spokesman told ABC News that in the fall of 2014, the department began three pilot programs to include social media in vetting.
[00:04:05.632 --> 00:04:10.135]  But officials say it's still not a widespread policy and review is underway.
[00:04:10.356 --> 00:04:13.638]  Could the massacre that occurred in San Bernardino have been prevented?
[00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:18.862]  Had the feds actually done what most Americans thought they'd been doing all along?
[00:04:19.082 --> 00:04:19.963]  Probably not.
[00:04:20.203 --> 00:04:22.285]  The TSA can barely do their job.
[00:04:22.705 --> 00:04:30.014]  Sporting a pathetic 95% failure rate, the status quo is tearing into two separate realities.
[00:04:30.254 --> 00:04:34.139]  The arrogant, compulsive fabrication the criminals in Washington, D.C.
[00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:39.846]  are still hawking, and another reality that, for most Americans, is a big pill to swallow.
[00:04:40.066 --> 00:04:47.393]  The growing evidence that layers of a trillion-dollar shadow government's nefarious inner workings are exponentially coming to light.
[00:04:47.673 --> 00:04:55.421]  For many Americans, admitting that your president is a traitor, based upon all of the evidence, is difficult to look squarely in the eye.
[00:04:55.561 --> 00:05:04.370]  You know, George W. Bush, after he staged 9-11 with his daddy, he said, you're either with us or with those al-Qaeda terrorists they hired on record.
[00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:06.932]  Well, I got news for the New World Order.
[00:05:07.312 --> 00:05:09.473]  You're either with humanity or you're against it!
[00:05:09.593 --> 00:05:16.176]  A mistrial has been declared in the case of Baltimore police officer William Porter in the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray.
[00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:21.099]  The jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision on the four charges the officer faces.
[00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:26.382]  Porter is the first of six city police officers to stand trial in the death of Freddie Gray.
[00:05:26.783 --> 00:05:34.108]  Gray suffered a broken neck and severe spinal cord injury while being transported in the back of a police van after his arrest on April 12th.
[00:05:34.388 --> 00:05:35.929]  He died in police custody.
[00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.213]  Baltimore City's Emergency Operations Center has been activated in preparation for protests.
[00:05:41.713 --> 00:05:45.494]  Police from around the Baltimore region began assembling Tuesday with riot gear.
[00:05:45.794 --> 00:05:53.137]  Jail space has been cleared in case of mass arrests, and political and community leaders are issuing calls for calm and peaceful protests.
[00:05:53.477 --> 00:05:58.299]  But some Black Lives Matter supporters are already threatening to stage riots in Baltimore.
[00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:03.721]  And some fear there could be a repeat of the massive rioting that took place in the city at the end of April.
[00:06:04.081 --> 00:06:07.262]  This is a developing story, so stay tuned to InfoWars.com.

[00:08:06.951 --> 00:08:08.332]  InfoWarsLife.com
[00:08:10.063 --> 00:08:10.643]  We've got it.
[00:08:10.683 --> 00:08:17.127]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:08:17.207 --> 00:08:19.308]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:27.213]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:39.142 --> 00:08:42.825]  Well, you talk about a smorgasbord of really important news and information.
[00:08:44.025 --> 00:08:45.126]  You got it today.
[00:08:45.586 --> 00:08:46.487]  It is coming down.
[00:08:46.747 --> 00:08:54.573]  The 17th of December, 2015, this Thursday transmission is broadcasting across the United States and around the world.
[00:08:55.213 --> 00:09:00.436]  Lord Monckton, on the aftermath of the World Government Treaty that they failed to ram through,
[00:09:01.777 --> 00:09:06.802]  Not completely, but for the most part we'll be popping in for 30 minutes at the start of the next hour.
[00:09:07.523 --> 00:09:26.680]  Then Paul Joseph Watson is going to be coming on the broadcast to get into this story that's at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that's illustrative of exactly who these Qatari, Saudi Arabian and other invaders are in Syria that are now being called refugees.
[00:09:27.699 --> 00:09:34.343]  And the federal government just released numbers that they've actually brought in 100,000, quote, Syrian refugees.
[00:09:35.724 --> 00:09:36.405]  Oh, you thought it was 10,000?
[00:09:36.665 --> 00:09:39.167]  There is a formula, folks.
[00:09:40.447 --> 00:09:43.429]  They said in Germany three years ago they were going to bring in 100,000.
[00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:48.593]  It's now 3 million in Germany alone, 1 million this year.
[00:09:50.384 --> 00:09:51.905]  When they say 10,000, it's 100,000.
[00:09:52.546 --> 00:09:54.147]  When they say 100,000, it's 300,000.
[00:09:55.228 --> 00:09:57.190]  When they say 300,000, it's a million.
[00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.191]  When they say a million, it's three million.
[00:10:00.092 --> 00:10:03.455]  When they say it's 20 million illegals here, they now admit it's 40 million.
[00:10:04.576 --> 00:10:05.797]  It's a formula.
[00:10:06.117 --> 00:10:12.642]  You watch it long enough, you become like the coach of the New England Patriots.
[00:10:12.662 --> 00:10:14.084]  You don't even need to steal the playbooks.
[00:10:14.424 --> 00:10:16.466]  You already have them memorized from watching the games.
[00:10:18.322 --> 00:10:20.623]  Well, I'm not an NFL coach, folks, but I am.
[00:10:22.184 --> 00:10:28.127]  Pretty much the best analyst when it comes down to really studying the Globalists and how they operate because I am obsessed with it.
[00:10:28.807 --> 00:10:29.308]  I live it.
[00:10:30.728 --> 00:10:33.630]  And I know their playbook up one side and down the other.
[00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:44.855]  You can mix and match their minions and replace them and rearrange them like deck chairs on the Titanic or the Lusitania, but at the end of the day, they follow a criminology.
[00:10:45.756 --> 00:10:47.497]  A modus operandi.
[00:10:48.533 --> 00:11:01.126]  It's how better police detectives can catch a serial killer six months out from him doing it and six months later figure out where they're going to strike next by immersing themselves in the mind of the enemy.
[00:11:01.567 --> 00:11:06.532]  Well, my task is a lot simpler than that because the globalists are very, very transparent.
[00:11:08.579 --> 00:11:09.059]  Sweden.
[00:11:09.079 --> 00:11:11.861]  This is the story up on DrugsReport.com.
[00:11:12.161 --> 00:11:12.622]  Sweden.
[00:11:12.842 --> 00:11:18.125]  Muslim migrants batter gay man to death, wrap snake around his neck.
[00:11:19.066 --> 00:11:24.569]  Now, we've seen some famous cases of gay men being beaten to death for no reason in the United States, and they get attention, and they should.
[00:11:24.589 --> 00:11:25.850]  It's wrong.
[00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:27.411]  It's stupid.
[00:11:27.451 --> 00:11:35.616]  People who aren't normally criminals, though, will go kill somebody for what race they are, or their sexual preference, because then it feels like it's okay that they're doing it.
[00:11:38.919 --> 00:11:43.967]  And now it's okay to beat up and kill white people in this country because, oh, you know, they're all racist, they deserve it.
[00:11:44.813 --> 00:11:46.254]  And the media tries to cover that up.
[00:11:46.994 --> 00:11:52.737]  And then when I criticize black racism, I get emails and see comments going, man, I used to like your show.
[00:11:52.777 --> 00:11:54.518]  Why are you racist against black people now?
[00:11:55.239 --> 00:12:12.868]  Well, you see, I exposed Tuskegee, which was already known before I was born, but I expose all the other things that aren't known and the plan to exterminate black people because I'm not racist and innocent black people don't deserve to be chopped up in the womb or being given sentences that aren't fair.
[00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:17.278]  But that doesn't mean that I support hordes of black racists either.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:18.300]  See?
[00:12:19.141 --> 00:12:20.644]  It's a complex thought process.
[00:12:20.704 --> 00:12:25.211]  It's not like either I'm for Black Lives Matter or I'm against it.
[00:12:26.613 --> 00:12:28.316]  I'm against George Soros running it.
[00:12:33.604 --> 00:12:39.646]  The radical Muslims, which are the majority in many countries in the Middle East now and other areas, murder people.
[00:12:39.686 --> 00:12:46.769]  I mean, I have a stack of news here where if someone attends a protest in Saudi Arabia, they chop their head off.
[00:12:47.209 --> 00:12:48.269]  That's in the news today.
[00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.931]  Not a word out of the liberals, not a word out of the feminists.
[00:12:53.231 --> 00:13:00.494]  They just tell me all day that if I don't basically let my woman boss me around, I'm anti-feminine.
[00:13:02.301 --> 00:13:07.206]  Hey, you try letting a woman boss you around and run your life, they'll leave you so fast it'll make your head spin.
[00:13:08.927 --> 00:13:09.788]  But see, I'm a man.
[00:13:09.968 --> 00:13:13.612]  I'm out conquering my domain.
[00:13:14.433 --> 00:13:16.595]  I'm out producing and building.
[00:13:17.476 --> 00:13:20.479]  So I don't need to sit there and curry favor with women.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.945]  Because women are looking for men, not little boys who are in arrested development.
[00:13:29.577 --> 00:13:31.099]  Women are not my problem.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.082]  Men who aren't men have a problem.
[00:13:34.223 --> 00:13:37.807]  And then they listen to popular media about how they're supposed to get a good woman.
[00:13:38.388 --> 00:13:42.753]  That's how you get to be alone or die alone.
[00:13:43.394 --> 00:13:48.540]  Everything the system pushes is to screw you up and arrest your development.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:50.620]  Sweden.
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.462]  Muslim migrants batter gay men to death.
[00:13:53.542 --> 00:13:56.323]  I saw another one of these last week where they stabbed one to death in London.
[00:13:57.064 --> 00:13:57.984]  They usually cover them up.
[00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:00.346]  So for everyone you see, you can bet there's about a hundred.
[00:14:00.786 --> 00:14:04.608]  Victim taunted over his sexual orientation during brutal murder.
[00:14:05.649 --> 00:14:08.110]  Two Muslim migrants in Sweden have been charged.
[00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.491]  That's their happy hunting ground.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.682]  No, they rape Swedish women, they don't get charged.
[00:14:12.742 --> 00:14:14.083]  It's just you don't kill a protected group.
[00:14:14.283 --> 00:14:17.847]  I'm not against gay people, it's just, you know, women are just as important as a gay man.
[00:14:17.907 --> 00:14:18.887]  I'm sorry, it's just true.
[00:14:19.568 --> 00:14:20.449]  And more sacrilege.
[00:14:20.909 --> 00:14:34.842]  Two Muslim migrants in Sweden have been charged with the hate crime murder of a gay man after they allegedly battered the victim to death before dressing him up in women's clothing and wrapping a snake around his neck.
[00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:42.424]  Another reason predators target gay men is they target the more feminine gay men that they can pick out, and obviously she won't fight for themselves.
[00:14:43.325 --> 00:14:46.106]  There's a lot of gay men out there that'll rip their arms out of their sockets.
[00:14:46.426 --> 00:14:48.067]  But again, you can't just tell they are.
[00:14:49.161 --> 00:14:59.104]  The two alleged perpetrators, and again they're just predators, the two alleged perpetrators are 16-year-old and 19-year-old refugees from Morocco, according to prosecutors.
[00:14:59.364 --> 00:15:02.544]  The victim was deliberately targeted because of his sexuality.
[00:15:02.845 --> 00:15:10.466]  Morocco is 99.9% Muslim, and being gay, lesbian, or transgender is illegal with punishments up to three years in prison.
[00:15:10.687 --> 00:15:13.787]  That's very lax compared to most Muslim countries where it's punishable by death.
[00:15:14.548 --> 00:15:15.848]  It wasn't illegal in Iraq,
[00:15:17.188 --> 00:15:18.468]  So they blew the country up.
[00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:24.170]  And women were 60% of college graduates, didn't have to wear a cover of their faces, and you could listen to rock and roll music.
[00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.331]  So they blew it up.
[00:15:26.071 --> 00:15:27.551]  Any country like that, they blow up.
[00:15:28.051 --> 00:15:28.812]  Our government does.
[00:15:29.672 --> 00:15:32.833]  And then everybody buys liquor and pizza and sits around going, get them!
[00:15:33.013 --> 00:15:33.953]  Oh, shock and awe!
[00:15:34.173 --> 00:15:34.894]  Cruise missiles!
[00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.074]  Blow that country up!
[00:15:36.914 --> 00:15:37.995]  Now it's all a failed state.
[00:15:38.255 --> 00:15:39.255]  Al Qaeda's taking over.
[00:15:39.435 --> 00:15:40.315]  They're running rampant.
[00:15:40.696 --> 00:15:41.796]  Our government's giving them missiles.
[00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:49.866]  The incident began when the gay man met the 16-year-old refugee in a park in Gothenburg and offered to help him by giving clothes and food.
[00:15:50.167 --> 00:15:57.151]  The three individuals ended up back at the gay man's apartment where the accused claims the man tried to have sex with the two migrants and they acted in self-defense.
[00:15:57.372 --> 00:15:57.472]  Oh.
[00:15:58.252 --> 00:16:04.977]  However, police recovered a video from the 16-year-old's cell phone which shows the gay man battered and bound the floor of the apartment.
[00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:10.801]  The 16-year-old is heard screaming and cursing at the man while insulting him over his sexual orientation.
[00:16:12.674 --> 00:16:26.821]  The alleged perpetrators claim the victim was already dressed in a woman when they met him, although the victim's boyfriend denies, well, who cares whether he's dressed in a dress or not, that his partner was cross-dresser and asserts that the victim was dressed in women's clothes to mock him.
[00:16:27.261 --> 00:16:32.304]  The dead snake was found wrapped around the victim's neck, of which police found drops of 16-year-old's blood.
[00:16:33.724 --> 00:16:34.765]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:16:35.065 --> 00:16:38.887]  You will not hear about this on MSNBC with Rachel Maddow.
[00:16:42.955 --> 00:16:46.579]  And that's the issue here, is you're not going to hear about this or if you do, it'll be a blip.
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:53.746]  If this was done by a Christian or a conservative or somebody like that, you would never hear the end of it.
[00:16:57.029 --> 00:16:59.151]  And that's the bias and the control in the media.
[00:16:59.171 --> 00:17:00.132]  Here's some of the other stories.
[00:17:00.913 --> 00:17:04.637]  As lawmakers clash over refugees, Syrian immigration quietly tops 100,000 since 2012.
[00:17:10.379 --> 00:17:20.391]  And again, many of them are really invaders into Syria, backed by the West that failed, and after they served their year tour, they get to retire to the United States with welfare.
[00:17:21.913 --> 00:17:22.694]  That's Fox News.
[00:17:23.875 --> 00:17:26.839]  Saudi Arabia orders execution of teen for attending protest.
[00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:30.243]  19-year-old has been moved to solitary confinement and could be beheaded any moment.
[00:17:31.463 --> 00:17:36.005]  Abdullah Az Zahir, the youngest person given the death sentence according to campaigners.
[00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:41.388]  Campaigners claim that he who attended the protest four years ago will be put to death.
[00:17:42.089 --> 00:17:44.190]  The 19-year-old has been moved to solitary confinement.
[00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:51.653]  Despite the possible repercussions, his family have gone public with a story and a final bid to save his life.
[00:17:51.694 --> 00:17:53.134]  That's in the UK Express.
[00:17:58.037 --> 00:18:00.118]  He participated in a protest rally.
[00:18:01.854 --> 00:18:02.735]  That's so liberal.
[00:18:03.175 --> 00:18:04.136]  Progressive media.
[00:18:04.176 --> 00:18:05.877]  Now, let's see who's like Saudi Arabia.
[00:18:06.357 --> 00:18:11.921]  Progressive media argues, thanks to ISIS, we have to consider limits to free speech.
[00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:15.286]  We're going to be breaking that article.
[00:18:15.326 --> 00:18:22.029]  Salon, of course, and Slate, and all these other publications are out there pushing this garbage.
[00:18:22.069 --> 00:18:23.410]  This is the leftist move in Europe.
[00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:25.831]  Ban free speech of libertarians and conservatives.
[00:18:26.611 --> 00:18:33.954]  They're now going to arrest Le Pen, who's leading presidential polls again, and whose party just won, basically, parliamentary elections.
[00:18:35.609 --> 00:18:37.511]  Regional elections across the country.
[00:18:38.392 --> 00:18:46.620]  She sent out on Twitter images of ISIS engaging in crimes to point out the threat they're going to basically indict her for promoting terrorism.
[00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:52.847]  France considers, you mean criminal socialists consider, prosecuting Marie Le Pen for tweeting violent Islamic State images.

[00:18:54.889 --> 00:18:55.590]  See the censorship?
[00:18:57.291 --> 00:18:57.672]  And now...
[00:18:59.386 --> 00:19:02.690]  Yale students signed a petition, we have video of this, to repeal the First Amendment.
[00:19:02.991 --> 00:19:03.872]  Fox News.
[00:19:04.152 --> 00:19:06.455]  This isn't Mark Dice in L.A.
[00:19:07.096 --> 00:19:07.997]  or San Diego.
[00:19:08.357 --> 00:19:13.283]  This isn't Alex Jones or Leanne McAdoo or Jakari Jackson in Austin, Texas at UT.
[00:19:14.305 --> 00:19:17.869]  This is at Yale.
[00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:25.336]  Where you walk up and say, let's repeal the First Amendment, let's ban all free speech for liberals to rule everything and they all sign it.
[00:19:25.496 --> 00:19:26.257]  These are not liberals.
[00:19:26.297 --> 00:19:37.345]  This is a cult of dangerous people who will absolutely sign on to putting us in forced labor camps, who will absolutely take our guns if they ever think they've got the power to do it.
[00:19:37.405 --> 00:19:40.488]  They are a power cult who want to dominate us.
[00:19:41.148 --> 00:19:42.970]  Literal scum of the earth.
[00:19:44.201 --> 00:19:44.882]  And it gets worse.
[00:19:45.002 --> 00:19:48.564]  Portland City Council wants to ban Donald Trump's speech as well.
[00:19:48.804 --> 00:19:50.045]  We've got video of that.
[00:19:50.765 --> 00:19:57.490]  Just an orgy of chomping at the bit like starving wolves to chew up free speech and butcher true liberalism.
[00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:07.737]  Monstrous scum allied with radical Islam that wants to murder women, gays and others and burn up and blow up every church they can and chop priests' heads off.
[00:20:10.188 --> 00:20:13.373]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?
[00:20:13.793 --> 00:20:15.596]  How would you like to never be cold again?

[00:21:09.682 --> 00:21:14.464]  As your body ages, there's a 10% decline in your ability to repair each passing decade after the age 28.
[00:21:15.144 --> 00:21:21.087]  By age 40, your ability to repair from demanding manual labor, exercise, or a stressful desk job has declined by 12%.

[00:21:34.653 --> 00:21:36.893]  My name is Jonathan Wright, and I'm 40 years old.
[00:21:36.973 --> 00:21:39.754]  I recently went from a desk job to a manual labor job.
[00:21:39.834 --> 00:21:40.814]  Normally, I'm worn out.
[00:21:40.954 --> 00:21:46.555]  With Energy Enhanced One World Way, I now recover so quickly that I can perform very hard work all day long.
[00:21:46.736 --> 00:21:51.837]  I use Energy Enhanced One World Way for breakfast and lunch, and I experience less hunger throughout the day.
[00:21:52.117 --> 00:21:54.937]  I have a 30% increase in energy, and I just feel better.
[00:21:55.217 --> 00:21:58.458]  I plan to make Energy Enhanced One World Way a permanent part of my lifestyle.

[00:22:09.306 --> 00:22:12.288]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[00:22:12.609 --> 00:22:17.773]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[00:22:18.093 --> 00:22:19.995]  But they're about to lose control.
[00:22:20.375 --> 00:22:25.359]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[00:22:25.699 --> 00:22:30.203]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:22:30.283 --> 00:22:32.325]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:22:32.345 --> 00:22:36.168]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[00:22:36.508 --> 00:22:40.594]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[00:22:41.034 --> 00:22:46.582]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves, but this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:22:46.742 --> 00:22:48.144]  This will affect us all.
[00:22:48.605 --> 00:22:52.110]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[00:22:53.311 --> 00:22:59.575]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.

[00:23:12.156 --> 00:23:13.436]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[00:24:09.724 --> 00:24:10.285]  You've got it.
[00:24:10.325 --> 00:24:14.313]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:24:14.413 --> 00:24:16.056]  Oh, thank you, Uncle.
[00:24:49.629 --> 00:24:57.093]  I want to get into Congress's half trillion dollar spending binge that is the biggest Democratic goodie package ever.
[00:24:57.833 --> 00:25:00.435]  It's bigger than anything Bill Clinton ever delivered to the Democrats.
[00:25:00.915 --> 00:25:03.096]  It's bigger than anything Bush ever sold out and did.
[00:25:03.616 --> 00:25:10.920]  I mean, Paul Ryan is working hard like MSNBC said, but isn't good enough that he works hard to enslave the country and bankrupt us.
[00:25:12.461 --> 00:25:17.083]  Because Melissa Harris Perry said, working hard puts down black slaves.
[00:25:18.607 --> 00:25:21.929]  No one can work hard but those slaves in that moment of Zen time.
[00:25:23.551 --> 00:25:24.071]  That's right.
[00:25:25.892 --> 00:25:35.379]  By the way, there's a great article from the Von Mies Institute on InfoWars.com that really eloquently illustrates what I've been trying to say in my own broken way.
[00:25:37.253 --> 00:25:41.735]  We're on the edge of world war, economic collapse, social problems.
[00:25:42.495 --> 00:25:45.076]  The Pentagon admits the world's the most dangerous it's ever been.
[00:25:45.136 --> 00:25:46.977]  Obama says he's made the world safer than ever.
[00:25:47.377 --> 00:25:48.517]  I mean, we're in crazy town.
[00:25:49.878 --> 00:25:56.900]  And the article goes, why is the New York Times number one story it runs, up to 10 stories a day, about transgender?
[00:25:58.141 --> 00:26:03.383]  Well, that's just what you'd expect in a science fiction comedy book novel by Kurt Vonnegut.
[00:26:04.143 --> 00:26:05.584]  We're on the edge of World War 4, folks!
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.082]  Robot computers are taking over.
[00:26:09.442 --> 00:26:12.324]  Militaries admit they're going to combat robots in the next five years.
[00:26:13.365 --> 00:26:15.467]  The elite admit the future doesn't need humans.
[00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:24.613]  And Gerald Cilente writes an article about New York Times off-trend with transgender blitz.
[00:26:27.856 --> 00:26:31.038]  This is what happens when Nero fiddled while Rome burned.
[00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:33.700]  And they go, why don't you like transgenders?
[00:26:34.201 --> 00:26:35.262]  I don't care!
[00:26:36.494 --> 00:26:41.598]  If you're going to have one as a celebrity, at least have it look like a good-looking woman, not an old guy in a wig!
[00:26:41.618 --> 00:26:45.342]  I mean, just leave me alone!
[00:26:46.623 --> 00:26:48.204]  Stop trying to tell me how to think!
[00:26:49.545 --> 00:26:50.826]  Stop thinking you run my life!
[00:26:50.886 --> 00:26:51.687]  It's disgusting!
[00:26:54.709 --> 00:27:03.577]  You think about an elite obsessed with stuff like this, and then meanwhile, Russia hasn't
[00:27:05.066 --> 00:27:06.467]  Not anything to the United States.
[00:27:06.947 --> 00:27:09.528]  Russia is in collapse mode.
[00:27:11.289 --> 00:27:12.730]  Russia had a deal with the U.S.
[00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:19.694]  in the early 1990s and NATO to not expand into any of its former satellites if the United States and NATO didn't.
[00:27:19.774 --> 00:27:26.157]  And now, for about six, seven years under Obama, we're going to play some clips coming up in the next segment of Putin.
[00:27:27.638 --> 00:27:33.201]  And they've encircled them and come in and have been overthrowing the countries and taking them over and moving weapons in.
[00:27:35.134 --> 00:27:43.900]  And then Russian ethnic areas on the borders of Russia that have been there for hundreds of years, like Crimea, they're blowing up all the major power lines and power stations.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:55.768]  And having radical Islamic groups bomb Russian planes out of the sky and Turkey shooting down Russian aircraft.
[00:27:57.289 --> 00:27:59.230]  And Putin says they've got missiles in place now.
[00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:01.612]  Turkey keeps flying aircraft in every day.
[00:28:01.672 --> 00:28:04.794]  Putin just came out and said, OK, we're going to start shooting them down next week.
[00:28:06.653 --> 00:28:11.936]  And that means when they fly over Syria to go into Iraq, the Iraqi government says, get out of here, we don't want you here.
[00:28:12.216 --> 00:28:15.899]  They're there bombing the Kurds that are fighting ISIS.
[00:28:17.139 --> 00:28:17.800]  On record.
[00:28:19.061 --> 00:28:26.945]  You see, they've got supply lines through western Iraq, into Syria, up into southern Turkey.
[00:28:28.606 --> 00:28:35.971]  And the Russians are bombing those supply lines the minute they come into Syria.
[00:28:37.881 --> 00:28:41.025]  And the Kurds are attacking on the other side trying to stop ISIS.
[00:28:41.045 --> 00:28:42.046]  So what's Turkey doing?
[00:28:43.107 --> 00:28:52.638]  They've sent ground troops in and traveled over a hundred miles through the mountains and desert and are now fighting the Kurds.
[00:28:53.746 --> 00:28:56.028]  in a pincer attack flanking the Russians.
[00:28:56.829 --> 00:29:08.198]  They're attacking from the north in Turkey, southern Turkey, and from the southeast into the west of Iraq in a full-on toe-to-toe with the Russians.
[00:29:09.198 --> 00:29:14.643]  And they're threatening to blow up Russian ships coming out of the Black Sea and in the Mediterranean.
[00:29:15.123 --> 00:29:18.186]  And any day now, giant war could break out
[00:29:18.846 --> 00:29:36.776]  But the average American is being force-fed the Kardashians, and that woman that looks like the penguin, and some snapping turtle with a wig on, while hordes of jihadists pour into Europe and rape and murder.
[00:29:39.118 --> 00:29:42.119]  When we come back, Putin says he likes Trump.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.720]  The two are friends and have hung out quite a bit.
[00:29:44.861 --> 00:29:47.843]  Trump says he wants to have a deep relationship with Russia and engage in trade.
[00:29:49.051 --> 00:29:51.133]  Another big plus for Donald Trump.
[00:29:52.774 --> 00:29:55.696]  The neocons call him a wimp because he doesn't want World War 3.
[00:29:59.039 --> 00:29:59.959]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.061]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.982 --> 00:30:05.684]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.679 --> 00:30:12.281]  A Middle Eastern woman was caught surveilling a U.S.
[00:30:12.341 --> 00:30:19.006]  port of entry on the Mexican border, holding a sketchbook with Arabic writing and drawings of the facility and its security system.
[00:30:19.326 --> 00:30:26.672]  The woman has been identified as 23-year-old Leila Abdel-Razak, according to a Customs and Border Patrol report obtained by Judicial Watch.
[00:30:26.952 --> 00:30:32.974]  When federal officers asked her why she was drawing sketches of the facility, she stated, because she's never been to the border.
[00:30:33.154 --> 00:30:36.395]  This comes on the heels of two separate incidents in the same vicinity.
[00:30:36.695 --> 00:30:41.697]  A few weeks ago, Judicial Watch reported that five young Middle Eastern men were apprehended by the U.S.
[00:30:41.737 --> 00:30:46.039]  Border Patrol in Amado, an Arizona town about 30 miles from the Mexican border.
[00:30:46.299 --> 00:30:49.620]  Two of the men were carrying stainless steel cylinders in backpacks.
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:57.963]  A week earlier, six men, one from Afghanistan and five from Pakistan, were arrested in a town that sits 20 miles north of the Mexican border.
[00:30:58.263 --> 00:31:04.785]  Meanwhile, the feds have repeatedly downplayed or ignored Islamic terror threats to focus on right-wing radicals.
[00:31:05.345 --> 00:31:07.586]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:31:09.625 --> 00:31:16.452]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered 6 months free at Christmas.
[00:31:16.532 --> 00:31:19.235]  We've always offered 5 months free.
[00:31:19.416 --> 00:31:25.002]  But since I announced 6 free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[00:31:25.342 --> 00:31:28.465]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[00:31:28.706 --> 00:31:31.709]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[00:31:32.009 --> 00:31:40.554]  All of my documentary films, scores of ebooks, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:32:09.369 --> 00:32:12.591]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:32:12.892 --> 00:32:20.898]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:32:21.138 --> 00:32:26.161]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:32:26.562 --> 00:32:28.843]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:32:40.427 --> 00:32:42.528]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:32:42.629 --> 00:32:47.372]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:50.795]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:32:50.915 --> 00:32:54.117]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:32:54.397 --> 00:32:56.199]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:32:56.379 --> 00:33:00.382]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.
[00:33:00.502 --> 00:33:06.086]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:33:16.835 --> 00:33:19.356]  I can't believe people don't know how wild things are right now.
[00:33:19.376 --> 00:33:21.457]  They should be on the edge of their seats.
[00:33:24.138 --> 00:33:25.738]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.878 --> 00:33:27.439]  Because there is a war on.
[00:33:28.259 --> 00:33:30.180]  For your minds.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.500]  Regional war breaks out.
[00:33:31.821 --> 00:33:33.821]  Between Russia and Turkey, NATO comes in.
[00:33:35.042 --> 00:33:35.362]  And then...
[00:33:37.855 --> 00:33:42.438]  You will see blood, radioactive rain from the sky.
[00:33:43.478 --> 00:33:46.599]  Those of you that like darkness, you can get a big taste of it.
[00:33:46.619 --> 00:33:47.760]  Let's go ahead and crank this up.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.822]  Here's NATO's theme song starting nuclear war with Russia.
[00:33:55.343 --> 00:34:01.566]  But nobody wins.
[00:34:01.586 --> 00:34:03.327]  Leaders go crazy from time to time.
[00:34:03.347 --> 00:34:06.188]  They have giant wars that kill hundreds of millions.
[00:34:07.961 --> 00:34:09.482]  That's with conventional weapons.
[00:34:12.523 --> 00:34:26.791]  But now, the politicians, the anointed ones, the big banks, think they control the destiny of the world and believe they have been given power by their God to rule!
[00:34:27.491 --> 00:34:36.836]  But they have a right of kings, and that no nation, no religion, no idea, no piece of property can stand in their way.
[00:34:38.237 --> 00:34:39.317]  They have gone insane.
[00:34:40.518 --> 00:34:41.958]  They have gone insane.
[00:34:43.138 --> 00:34:43.958]  They are the madmen.
[00:34:46.359 --> 00:34:48.559]  Who point their fingers at us and claim we are mad.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:55.021]  Because we burn with life and are awake as our ancestors were.
[00:34:55.981 --> 00:35:03.843]  Not the zombified hordes of slaves that serve the fraud that is the technocratic world government.
[00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.950]  Close your eyes.
[00:35:12.812 --> 00:35:19.316]  And then go insane like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[00:35:20.356 --> 00:35:21.357]  No, I don't choose that.
[00:35:21.777 --> 00:35:24.218]  I won't turn my will over to you, ever.
[00:35:25.479 --> 00:35:27.100]  No, I'm not gonna close my eyes.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.901]  I'm not gonna go insane.
[00:35:32.685 --> 00:35:34.387]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:35:34.407 --> 00:35:35.067]  to 2 p.m.
[00:35:35.107 --> 00:35:36.348]  Central Time, I'm here hosting.
[00:35:36.368 --> 00:35:40.011]  Then the fourth hour is hosted by one of our great anchors or investigative journalists.
[00:35:40.412 --> 00:35:43.735]  And today, Infowars Nightly News Director Rob Dew is going to be hosting.
[00:35:44.515 --> 00:35:53.023]  And we're going to premiere a deep analysis of the Bushes and their Nazi connection, right through to Jeb Bush currently, with breaking intel.
[00:35:54.504 --> 00:35:56.846]  Just to show you their mindset and who they really are.
[00:35:56.906 --> 00:35:58.827]  I'm not saying it's a Nazi conspiracy now.
[00:36:00.265 --> 00:36:09.573]  I'm saying the word is, and the evidence is, the Bushes got a big chunk of the Nazi horde at the end of World War II.
[00:36:10.474 --> 00:36:13.417]  That's coming up in the middle of the fourth hour today.
[00:36:14.378 --> 00:36:24.887]  Also, I've already got some of the sneak peeks, and I've talked to some people that won't tell me everything about it, but have seen pieces of it out in LA.
[00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:30.873]  Because what happens is you get early copies before stuff comes out, but it's got text all over it.
[00:36:32.234 --> 00:36:35.997]  If you're in the High Level Screen Actors Guild and get to vote in the Academy Awards.
[00:36:36.537 --> 00:36:37.818]  So some of this stuff's leaked.
[00:36:38.759 --> 00:36:39.960]  And I haven't been told much.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:46.124]  I went out and looked at leaks online and can tell which ones are what I was told.
[00:36:46.905 --> 00:36:48.026]  And see, that's kind of how this works.
[00:36:48.446 --> 00:36:51.008]  I don't want to know what's in something before it's released.
[00:36:52.022 --> 00:36:53.363]  Because there's even legal issues with that.
[00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:58.548]  I just get little pieces to then know, looking at other leaks, whether those were accurate leaks or not.
[00:36:59.089 --> 00:37:00.430]  That's a way to reverse engineer it.
[00:37:02.432 --> 00:37:04.694]  And so we got a pretty good idea of what's in the film.
[00:37:04.714 --> 00:37:09.419]  And I gotta say, the plot is better than I thought it would be.
[00:37:09.439 --> 00:37:13.082]  And so now I'm not so negative on it.
[00:37:15.623 --> 00:37:18.704]  And people say, why do you care about Star Wars with all this big news happening worldwide?
[00:37:18.724 --> 00:37:21.425]  Aren't you kind of violating what you said yourself that we should be focusing on real issues?
[00:37:22.245 --> 00:37:25.046]  Upwards of 80% of the info war is in entertainment.
[00:37:25.406 --> 00:37:27.347]  That's where the messengers are planted.
[00:37:27.747 --> 00:37:30.028]  That's where a lot of the bad stuff happens, a lot of the good stuff happens.
[00:37:30.628 --> 00:37:31.108]  As you know.
[00:37:33.269 --> 00:37:37.330]  And, I mean, the guy they had play Anakin Skywalker looked like he was from Nickelodeon or something.
[00:37:38.471 --> 00:37:40.011]  He's a white guy, whatever his name is.
[00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:41.752]  I mean, he's just not a good actor.
[00:37:41.952 --> 00:37:43.292]  I'm sorry, I'm sure he's a nice guy.
[00:37:43.672 --> 00:37:45.153]  He just doesn't come off as believable.
[00:37:49.005 --> 00:37:50.646]  I mean, I guess he's handsome, you could say.
[00:37:50.666 --> 00:37:51.786]  He doesn't look very manly.
[00:37:51.986 --> 00:37:53.927]  I mean, Darth Vader needs to look manly, folks.
[00:37:53.967 --> 00:37:54.348]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:56.609 --> 00:37:58.149]  And then they got this new actor.
[00:37:58.289 --> 00:37:59.510]  There's this young black guy.
[00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:00.651]  He doesn't look manly.
[00:38:01.631 --> 00:38:03.172]  He doesn't pull off a Stormtrooper.
[00:38:06.593 --> 00:38:11.356]  You know, the black actor that plays Mace Windu pulls it off.
[00:38:13.257 --> 00:38:15.017]  You believe he could defeat the Emperor.
[00:38:17.058 --> 00:38:17.979]  You don't believe
[00:38:20.455 --> 00:38:22.176]  That the other characters are believable.
[00:38:22.196 --> 00:38:23.396]  It's just bad casting.
[00:38:24.236 --> 00:38:24.817]  It just is.
[00:38:25.757 --> 00:38:30.119]  And like, both the bad guy and the good person, they're both women.
[00:38:30.519 --> 00:38:33.440]  You know, I don't care if women are the heroes in movies.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.301]  But then the directive to make all the heroes women.
[00:38:37.882 --> 00:38:39.422]  And China runs the U.S.
[00:38:39.442 --> 00:38:42.203]  space program because we're not smart enough in The Martian.
[00:38:42.323 --> 00:38:43.864]  It's just the propaganda.
[00:38:50.811 --> 00:38:56.056]  So Samuel L. Jackson is a great actor and has real gravitas.
[00:38:56.496 --> 00:39:01.100]  This new guy, let's put him back on screen, John Boyega?
[00:39:03.382 --> 00:39:08.026]  I mean, he just looks like somebody couldn't find his way out of a wet paper bag.
[00:39:08.687 --> 00:39:14.052]  And then the clips they show of him in the movie, he looks like he's got a 75 IQ or something.
[00:39:15.407 --> 00:39:21.313]  I mean I would cast this guy to play the part, I'm not being mean, of maybe somebody that's had a lobotomy.
[00:39:23.035 --> 00:39:25.037]  I mean that's what he radiates is that he's stupid.
[00:39:26.358 --> 00:39:27.900]  But see that's the image they sell now.
[00:39:29.341 --> 00:39:30.843]  And so I just expect it to be...
[00:39:33.843 --> 00:39:34.523]  Hard to watch.
[00:39:35.284 --> 00:39:36.885]  Now, I got some friends that are going tonight.
[00:39:36.925 --> 00:39:38.165]  We'll have reviews for you tomorrow.
[00:39:38.705 --> 00:39:41.867]  Jakari Jackson and Kit Daniels are gonna go see it tomorrow.
[00:39:42.127 --> 00:39:43.048]  They're gonna have a review.
[00:39:43.168 --> 00:39:44.969]  I'll have them in studio with me Sunday to talk about it.
[00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:47.910]  I'll just be honest with you.
[00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:49.791]  I'm not going to see it for a while.
[00:39:49.811 --> 00:39:51.332]  I just got more serious things to do.
[00:39:52.611 --> 00:39:59.273]  I will hijack it before it comes out today with a special report with a sneak peek and basically leak the plot without even watching it.
[00:40:00.514 --> 00:40:01.794]  And that's what I do.
[00:40:01.894 --> 00:40:07.276]  I mean, I don't watch myself on Discovery Channel, History Channel or TruTV or any of the shows I'm on either.
[00:40:07.296 --> 00:40:08.037]  I'm not bragging.
[00:40:08.257 --> 00:40:09.917]  I just don't want to look at myself.
[00:40:10.218 --> 00:40:11.678]  I want to move on to the next objective.
[00:40:11.718 --> 00:40:12.378]  I'm in a war.
[00:40:13.639 --> 00:40:21.882]  The only reason I'm talking about Star Wars Episode 7 is because it is an allegory to what's happened in our world and Episode 3 was excellent.
[00:40:23.991 --> 00:40:24.492]  The prequel.
[00:40:25.353 --> 00:40:27.777]  And basically, if you understand that movie, you understand how everything works.
[00:40:27.878 --> 00:40:29.721]  False flags, how wars are used.
[00:40:29.901 --> 00:40:31.944]  There's an article on InfoWars.com today about it.
[00:40:32.245 --> 00:40:35.470]  The plot of Star Wars frighteningly resembles modern-day America.
[00:40:36.735 --> 00:40:43.740]  Well, that's what George Lucas, to his credit, said when it came out, Episode 3, what, 6, 7, 8 years ago?
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.460]  I don't remember now.
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:49.143]  He said, no, I rewrote Episode 3 to parallel what 9-11 really was.
[00:40:49.844 --> 00:40:51.785]  And that's him telling you I'm a 9-11 truther.
[00:40:52.086 --> 00:40:56.469]  So I have to respect George Lucas, even though he committed the abomination of Jar Jar Binks.
[00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:59.891]  And even though I'm told he's not pro-gun.
[00:41:00.872 --> 00:41:02.493]  He does get what 9-11 was.
[00:41:02.933 --> 00:41:04.314]  And he did rewrite the plot.
[00:41:10.365 --> 00:41:12.147]  So, it is very informative.
[00:41:12.647 --> 00:41:15.570]  And Abrams, the director, is a very good director.
[00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:18.192]  I'm not really a Star Trek fan, and I've seen the last few Star Treks.
[00:41:18.593 --> 00:41:19.353]  They're really good.
[00:41:19.413 --> 00:41:20.875]  They have false flag plots.
[00:41:23.517 --> 00:41:28.642]  And see, why are all these Captain America movies and all this, basically, people watch them and go, it's like Alex Jones wrote this.
[00:41:28.942 --> 00:41:34.307]  And I later learned, the folks that did write some of the Captain America are familiar with the show, and we did influence it.
[00:41:35.322 --> 00:41:36.223]  I put some feelers out.
[00:41:36.904 --> 00:41:44.756]  And that's not bragging, it's showing how us engaging entertainment and doing analysis of it is very, very popular.
[00:41:45.637 --> 00:41:49.123]  I've had quite a few folks from the movie Prometheus
[00:41:53.507 --> 00:42:00.372]  Well, one of them directly reached out, others to the grapevine, and said, wow, we really like your analysis of it, even before I saw it.
[00:42:00.392 --> 00:42:12.242]  I mean, I just had the leaks, and they said that's exactly what the inside baseball is, is this is a real creation narrative of the elite, and it's what the elite really think happened on Earth.
[00:42:13.042 --> 00:42:18.507]  So that's why the next one, I think it's called Genesis, is coming out, and you're being told
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.041]  Exactly what the elite actually believe is going on.
[00:42:22.361 --> 00:42:26.522]  And see, that's my job, is to tell you what they're really thinking, what they're really doing.
[00:42:26.822 --> 00:42:33.504]  And so naturally, that's who's going to watch and listen to this show, because folks, you are getting the inside baseball.
[00:42:34.144 --> 00:42:36.105]  And that's no brag, that's just fact.
[00:42:37.406 --> 00:42:39.287]  I want everyone to get what's going on.
[00:42:39.447 --> 00:42:41.327]  I want everyone to understand what's going on.
[00:42:41.507 --> 00:42:55.372]  I want to take the Promethean fire that the elites have and are hoarding for themselves, given to us by God, they're keeping it, and the priest classed, to try to become gods themselves, while keeping the technology from us.
[00:42:57.032 --> 00:43:02.274]  And whether it was galactic seeding, or pan-transpermia,
[00:43:06.547 --> 00:43:12.392]  Whatever the cosmology is, the Bible is dead on.
[00:43:15.835 --> 00:43:17.916]  And we're not in Kansas, we never were.
[00:43:18.236 --> 00:43:26.063]  We are on a planetoid in deep space with a fantastical universe around us and the globalists don't ever want us to tune into that.
[00:43:26.283 --> 00:43:29.486]  They want us to be obsessed in a false proto-matrix like
[00:43:30.748 --> 00:43:44.674]  Times Square, where they feed us all the images and seduce us into their world that is a limited paradigm where they can pretend to be God over us, but are not gods.
[00:43:45.535 --> 00:43:48.456]  A real God would give us free will.
[00:43:48.536 --> 00:43:50.697]  A real God would empower us.
[00:43:50.817 --> 00:43:51.858]  A real God
[00:43:53.254 --> 00:44:01.736]  ...would create creatures that can develop ideas and sciences in their minds, and then over time by working, manifest it physically.
[00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:06.783]  This species is so incredibly powerful.
[00:44:07.343 --> 00:44:09.485]  Look where we've come from and where we are now.
[00:44:09.785 --> 00:44:20.872]  And only at this point, with the massive technology and the developments and everything we've got, and the medical developments, they're curing blindness, they're curing deafness, they're curing everything right now.
[00:44:21.413 --> 00:44:23.694]  They don't want the general public to get that.
[00:44:23.995 --> 00:44:25.215]  But many of the elites do.
[00:44:25.436 --> 00:44:27.317]  There's a battle over the future right now.
[00:44:29.189 --> 00:44:36.451]  There's a fantastical war happening, thousands of times more intricate and colorful than the fantasy land of Star Wars.
[00:44:38.391 --> 00:44:39.211]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:44:42.732 --> 00:44:46.373]  The globalists have divided Europe against the United States and against Russia.
[00:44:46.693 --> 00:44:49.273]  The globalists play nations and peoples off against each other.
[00:44:50.254 --> 00:44:51.494]  They manipulate our weaknesses.
[00:44:53.629 --> 00:45:02.581]  We should have from the beginning been natural allies like we were until World War II and before that the Communists take over in 1917 with Russia.
[00:45:02.882 --> 00:45:06.747]  We should already have giant joint programs with Russia.
[00:45:06.887 --> 00:45:08.129]  We would already be on Mars.
[00:45:08.569 --> 00:45:10.352]  We should be working with China.
[00:45:10.632 --> 00:45:28.025]  We should be building up Africa and Latin America, and globalists claim that world government's about that, but instead it's about suppressing all the countries, and playing us off against each other, and putting suppressive global carbon taxes, controlled by the Anglo-American establishment, against the entire world, militarily, to shut us down.
[00:45:29.767 --> 00:45:33.750]  While the elites hoard our resources, our inventions, our developments, in secretive
[00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:42.377]  Offshore armored redoubts and university and governmental and corporate reservations.
[00:45:43.918 --> 00:45:44.539]  Campuses.
[00:45:45.039 --> 00:45:46.220]  Underground facilities.
[00:45:48.522 --> 00:45:49.882]  Where they live and we sleep.
[00:45:50.263 --> 00:45:52.204]  Where they transcend, we fall.
[00:45:53.165 --> 00:45:54.366]  Where they live, we die.
[00:45:55.026 --> 00:46:00.750]  But what's scary is, the evil ones will never transcend with this technology because they're already falling.
[00:46:03.339 --> 00:46:09.244]  To first go to the next level in God's plan, we have to believe in other people and truly want to build others up.
[00:46:10.765 --> 00:46:17.350]  And also be focused and strong to identify who the enemy is and not be chomped by them.
[00:46:19.652 --> 00:46:20.532]  The enemy is failing.
[00:46:21.513 --> 00:46:22.994]  We are in a death battle with them.
[00:46:24.115 --> 00:46:30.140]  In the 10th round we're entering right now of 12 rounds, ladies and gentlemen, we have taken the initiative.
[00:46:31.394 --> 00:46:33.275]  The enemy is rising to its feet bloodied.
[00:46:34.535 --> 00:46:35.395]  We're bloody as well.
[00:46:36.335 --> 00:46:44.478]  And they are screaming with jealousy and envy and hatred that they won't control the destiny of humanity and that we're about to break free!
[00:46:46.018 --> 00:46:46.678]  Wings out!
[00:46:47.439 --> 00:46:48.219]  Into the stars!
[00:46:49.329 --> 00:46:56.531]  They've got hooks and bounds and ties and nooses like lillipollies trying to hold down the human spirit in God's plan.
[00:46:56.951 --> 00:47:04.014]  And we're tearing free, but as soon as we tear free, thousands of other hooks shoot up and tear into our flesh.
[00:47:04.214 --> 00:47:11.056]  But the moment we know the lillipollies are there, because only a fraction of us know, our strength will intensify a trillion fold.
[00:47:12.697 --> 00:47:19.503]  And those hooks and those barbs and all those spears in us will form into a structure that takes us to the next level.
[00:47:22.765 --> 00:47:27.189]  And they howl with hatred because the evil ones know how beautiful we are.
[00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:30.151]  And they can see us, we can't see ourselves.
[00:47:30.732 --> 00:47:38.518]  And they are just gouging their eyes out, wanting to kill our innocence, wanting to poison our food, wanting to disease our planet, wanting to pull it down.
[00:47:38.538 --> 00:47:39.799]  This egg, this yolk,
[00:47:42.466 --> 00:47:44.547]  That is ours to use and be born.
[00:47:45.447 --> 00:47:49.208]  They want to abort this species here on Terra Firma.
[00:47:49.668 --> 00:47:52.509]  The battle will be decided for the future of our species.
[00:47:53.369 --> 00:47:56.290]  An epic war that you're now part of.
[00:47:59.791 --> 00:48:01.731]  That's why the enemy always says I'm not for real.
[00:48:02.052 --> 00:48:05.192]  That's why they try to demonize me and claim I'm bad because they know I'm good.
[00:48:06.713 --> 00:48:08.413]  They know I'm shattered up in battle.
[00:48:08.613 --> 00:48:10.494]  They know I'm hacking at the enemy.
[00:48:12.978 --> 00:48:20.363]  They know I'm committed and they know the fire I carry in my heart is a fire of old that will spread and will burn them to the ground.
[00:48:21.784 --> 00:48:22.604]  They fear us.
[00:48:23.925 --> 00:48:24.766]  They know us.
[00:48:26.587 --> 00:48:27.908]  They are the enemies of old.
[00:48:30.189 --> 00:48:32.210]  Now you need to decide which side you're on right now.
[00:48:34.592 --> 00:48:36.193]  Will the age of chivalry return?
[00:48:37.093 --> 00:48:38.394]  Will the Renaissance return?
[00:48:39.335 --> 00:48:40.996]  Will humanity go to the next level?
[00:48:41.536 --> 00:48:42.297]  Or will we fall?
[00:48:43.615 --> 00:48:46.297]  God is a God of free will and destiny.
[00:48:47.218 --> 00:48:49.720]  You must take free will and your destiny in your hands.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.341]  The choice is up to you.
[00:48:52.602 --> 00:48:54.984]  Putin has called Trump an outstanding and talented man.
[00:48:55.004 --> 00:48:56.385]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[00:48:58.667 --> 00:48:59.328]  AFP.
[00:48:59.948 --> 00:49:01.389]  Putin praises absolute leader.
[00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:03.111]  Trump is colorful, talented guy.
[00:49:03.191 --> 00:49:03.932]  Bloomberg business.
[00:49:04.632 --> 00:49:05.773]  Talented absolute leader.
[00:49:05.793 --> 00:49:06.734]  Putin praises Trump.
[00:49:08.467 --> 00:49:09.968]  Let them fly there now.
[00:49:10.048 --> 00:49:12.289]  Putin threatens to shoot down Turkish jets in Syria.
[00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:13.850]  Calls Ergun an ass kisser.
[00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:18.873]  Meanwhile, the New York Times says off-trend with transgender blitz.
[00:49:18.893 --> 00:49:20.134]  That's what we should be focused on.
[00:49:21.375 --> 00:49:22.215]  Not the Milky Way.
[00:49:22.275 --> 00:49:23.296]  Not Alpha Centauri.
[00:49:25.057 --> 00:49:26.137]  Not bionic eyes.
[00:49:26.197 --> 00:49:27.098]  Not life extension.
[00:49:29.537 --> 00:49:33.299]  We should be focused on our iPhones made in slave factories and worship them.
[00:49:33.759 --> 00:49:37.041]  We should talk about how ugly humans are and how bad we are for the Earth.
[00:49:37.941 --> 00:49:41.403]  Of course in our crib we're going to crap our diapers.
[00:49:42.023 --> 00:49:45.265]  Of course at this level we're not perfect, but look how much we've already cleaned up.
[00:49:45.645 --> 00:49:47.586]  It's the globalists diseasing the planet.
[00:49:47.806 --> 00:49:49.747]  It's the globalists mutating the species.
[00:49:49.987 --> 00:49:56.491]  It's the globalists attacking every family of life forms and genetically engineering it to not bear fruit.
[00:49:57.191 --> 00:49:59.792]  Engineering the death virus into the planet!
[00:50:00.332 --> 00:50:03.453]  Testing the murder of the planet in front of us!
[00:50:03.693 --> 00:50:13.057]  And then standing up there, Al Gore, heavily invested in all these companies, lecturing us how he's here to save the world when he is a giant black devil.
[00:50:15.097 --> 00:50:19.739]  Leering down to suck blood out of the planet itself.
[00:50:20.819 --> 00:50:25.081]  The ultimate festering, soft, stinking vampire.
[00:50:27.643 --> 00:50:28.823]  An enemy!
[00:50:29.884 --> 00:50:32.404]  An enemy of you and your family!
[00:50:33.245 --> 00:50:33.805]  Total!
[00:50:34.405 --> 00:50:35.025]  Complete!
[00:50:35.665 --> 00:50:36.606]  Turned over!
[00:50:39.507 --> 00:50:42.127]  For the God of this world that's no God at all.
[00:50:44.448 --> 00:50:45.829]  Let's skip this break.
[00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.350]  Thank you.
[00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:53.611]  Putin calls Trump an outstanding, talented man.
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:51:03.685]  I'm going to let Daria, who speaks fluent Russian, actually give you the translation as best she can here.
[00:51:05.746 --> 00:51:07.287]  That's because he's talking somewhat quick.
[00:51:07.907 --> 00:51:10.469]  And then I'll actually go over it, what he says about Donald Trump.
[00:51:10.489 --> 00:51:16.112]  But the best part is, he talks about Trump wants a deep relationship with Russia, wants trade, wants to work with us, doesn't want to be enemies.
[00:51:16.772 --> 00:51:17.993]  How could we not be for him?
[00:51:18.073 --> 00:51:23.076]  But we don't want to get involved in the American elections, obviously because they'll use that and say we're interfering.
[00:51:25.526 --> 00:51:27.527]  Trump is going against the military-industrial complex.
[00:51:27.747 --> 00:51:31.469]  He's going against the brokerage firms, saying you shouldn't be tax-exempt when poor people aren't.
[00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:39.332]  Trump has said some things that I don't agree with on the internet and on going after families, but then he's backtracked on that.
[00:51:39.352 --> 00:51:39.913]  That's the thing.
[00:51:39.933 --> 00:51:41.954]  It's not flip-flop.
[00:51:41.994 --> 00:51:43.174]  He goes, okay, I see what you're saying.
[00:51:43.194 --> 00:51:43.854]  Yeah, this is better.
[00:51:50.057 --> 00:51:52.098]  What do you think it says when Trump comes on this show?
[00:51:52.338 --> 00:51:53.239]  You think he's stupid?
[00:51:54.264 --> 00:51:55.385]  He wants everybody to know.
[00:51:56.206 --> 00:51:57.947]  He knows the foreign leaders listen to this show.
[00:51:58.187 --> 00:51:59.609]  He knows Putin listens to this show.
[00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:01.330]  By the way, that's a fact.
[00:52:02.191 --> 00:52:02.711]  For years.
[00:52:03.051 --> 00:52:05.894]  I was told that by RT like nine years ago.
[00:52:05.914 --> 00:52:07.956]  When they were first coming to the US.
[00:52:08.536 --> 00:52:10.137]  Then I was told that by the head of RT.
[00:52:14.481 --> 00:52:18.885]  Then one time they told me I was gonna be on national Russian TV and I wasn't on national Russian TV.
[00:52:19.906 --> 00:52:22.228]  The Skype turned on and I was in a room.
[00:52:23.325 --> 00:52:25.767]  I was in a room here, but in a room there in Russia.
[00:52:25.787 --> 00:52:29.589]  And I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:34.592]  Just like when Matt Drudge was here in studio, I was like, well, he's not gonna come on air, will people even believe it?
[00:52:34.612 --> 00:52:40.356]  And the whole point is, things are more fantastic than you know.
[00:52:40.576 --> 00:52:45.780]  The world's a lot stranger than people understand, until you wake up and really look around, open your eyes.
[00:52:47.159 --> 00:52:50.282]  And some big decisions are being made right now about the future of this planet.
[00:52:50.783 --> 00:52:55.587]  But the people running this country in Europe right now want collapse for everyone but them.
[00:52:56.228 --> 00:52:57.289]  That's how they conquer us.
[00:52:57.509 --> 00:53:00.372]  It's not a war even against nations or even religions.
[00:53:00.552 --> 00:53:01.853]  It's against the individual.
[00:53:02.994 --> 00:53:06.978]  Because when they've got a global depression in place, they're going to play the part of the savior.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.743]  And the hand they give us is going to drag us straight into enslavement.
[00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:17.450]  Daria, go ahead and tell us about this clip and then go ahead and play it and narrate for us.
[00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:18.492]  Why don't you give us your view?
[00:53:18.532 --> 00:53:21.097]  I didn't tell you I was going to do this, but give us your view on Putin.
[00:53:21.897 --> 00:53:25.758]  I mean, you came over here, you know, I guess to escape the tyranny from Russia when you were a kid.
[00:53:25.778 --> 00:53:28.619]  You've been in the military, defense language school, a patriot.
[00:53:29.319 --> 00:53:31.420]  You know, you work here four or five months.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.280]  We really like having you here.
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:35.261]  You do a great job running the soundboard and run a lot of the video feeds.
[00:53:36.482 --> 00:53:39.143]  And I've really never even talked to you a lot personally.
[00:53:39.163 --> 00:53:42.864]  I'm so busy about overall your view of what's happening.
[00:53:42.884 --> 00:53:45.625]  But give us your view on this clip and then let's go to it.
[00:53:46.505 --> 00:54:02.453]  Okay, well this looks like a bunch of reporters after the press conference that Putin just did today, and there seems to be an American reporter who's trying to speak Russian to Putin, and he's asking Donald Trump, he's asking him what he thinks of Donald Trump.
[00:54:02.513 --> 00:54:07.775]  And I think it's pretty cool, I think his response is pretty cool, so we can go over that right now.
[00:54:07.795 --> 00:54:12.978]  We're going to go to that clip in a moment, and I'm putting you on the spot here, this is what I do, this is truly teleprompter free and totally transparent.
[00:54:14.198 --> 00:54:15.519]  What is your view overall of Putin?
[00:54:17.085 --> 00:54:26.953]  Well, you know, as a Russian and having to grow up in a system where our presidents were very disrespected, we personally disrespected them.
[00:54:27.094 --> 00:54:31.637]  They didn't project any power on the world stage.
[00:54:31.797 --> 00:54:36.762]  I'm actually very proud of the current president of Russia, and I do support him.
[00:54:38.598 --> 00:54:39.798]  Well, who couldn't support him?
[00:54:39.818 --> 00:54:41.259]  He's trying to stop World War III.
[00:54:41.639 --> 00:54:42.959]  He's trying to promote families.
[00:54:43.279 --> 00:54:45.979]  He's trying to restore the right to own guns.
[00:54:46.019 --> 00:54:48.760]  He's going after... Some people say he may secretly be a communist.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:52.101]  Well, I mean, if somebody's secretly a communist, they don't do all this.
[00:54:52.121 --> 00:54:53.361]  They don't promote freedom.
[00:54:53.541 --> 00:54:54.481]  Like Trump.
[00:54:54.761 --> 00:54:56.661]  Trump's the only one bringing up all these topics.
[00:54:57.321 --> 00:54:59.842]  I mean, even if he's not for real, his words are for real.
[00:55:00.102 --> 00:55:01.202]  It's creating opposition.
[00:55:01.242 --> 00:55:02.722]  The globalists don't like what Trump's doing.
[00:55:02.742 --> 00:55:03.703]  What do you think about Trump?
[00:55:03.723 --> 00:55:04.543]  And again, I don't know your view.
[00:55:04.563 --> 00:55:05.163]  We're about to find out.
[00:55:06.677 --> 00:55:08.538]  Well, I'm just excited to watch him.
[00:55:08.638 --> 00:55:15.243]  I'm glad that there is such a strong personality among the candidates for the American presidency.
[00:55:15.943 --> 00:55:26.610]  And finally, we have somebody who can be bold about his words, as opposed to all these puppets that are basically, I don't even know what they're doing there on stage.
[00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:27.290]  It's a joke.
[00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:31.413]  I hate seeing presidents being kept, puppets, bullied by the media.
[00:55:32.193 --> 00:55:34.375]  Now, a president too out of control is not good either.
[00:55:34.415 --> 00:55:41.742]  He needs to follow the people and the Constitution and common sense, but to see them bullied, kept creatures by PR stuntmen is a fraud.
[00:55:42.162 --> 00:55:43.304]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[00:55:43.344 --> 00:55:45.265]  Putin calls Trump an outstanding, talented man.
[00:55:45.546 --> 00:55:53.954]  Nobody else is doing these translations, that's why we're doing them, so you can hear what he actually said, because a lot of times they water down his UN speeches and other things, and then we actually give you what he really said.
[00:55:54.474 --> 00:55:55.295]  So, Daria, go ahead.
[00:55:55.575 --> 00:55:56.316]  All right, here we go.
[00:55:58.299 --> 00:56:02.063]  What do you think of Donald Trump?
[00:56:02.684 --> 00:56:13.194]  Well, he's a very bright personality, a talented person, without a doubt, but it is not our job to judge his virtues and merits, it's the job of the voters of the United States.
[00:56:14.759 --> 00:56:18.422]  But he is an absolute leader in the race for the presidency.
[00:56:19.003 --> 00:56:25.568]  He says that he wants a deep relationship between us to reach new levels of cooperation.
[00:56:25.608 --> 00:56:26.729]  How can we not support that?
[00:56:27.209 --> 00:56:28.210]  Of course, we support that.
[00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:39.179]  But when it comes to the internal politics, the way he uses his words, how popular he is, again, I repeat that it is not our business to judge his words on that level.
[00:56:40.825 --> 00:56:41.805]  So, there you go.
[00:56:42.065 --> 00:56:43.706]  There is this comment on Donald Trump.
[00:56:43.746 --> 00:56:44.926]  The two are reportedly friends.
[00:56:45.327 --> 00:56:55.750]  That has really got upset the globalists who just want us all killing each other, fighting with each other on no-bid contracts that the military-industrial complex and Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan then make the money off of.
[00:56:56.130 --> 00:57:01.332]  And then we lose all these wars and we spend $5 trillion in the war on terror the last 14 years.
[00:57:01.672 --> 00:57:08.894]  And now, Al-Qaeda's gone from 3,000 people to 200,000 and it's called ISIS and it's running around with Stinger missiles our government gave them.
[00:57:09.115 --> 00:57:10.235]  I mean, Daria, this is pretty clear.
[00:57:12.108 --> 00:57:22.253]  Yeah, again, I'm just kind of really excited about watching, observing these developments on the world stage.
[00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:26.715]  Well, we all got front row seats, and it's either going to be the Valhalla or hell.
[00:57:26.775 --> 00:57:27.495]  Thank you, Daria.

[00:58:09.451 --> 00:58:10.172]  I'm a maniac.
[00:58:10.512 --> 00:58:11.492]  I'm in a fight of my life.
[00:58:12.253 --> 00:58:13.494]  You are too, even if you don't know it.
[00:58:13.754 --> 00:58:14.695]  This is history.
[00:58:15.255 --> 00:58:15.495]  And I'm 110%.
[00:58:15.535 --> 00:58:18.457]  And I'm just going to go to the end.
[00:58:18.517 --> 00:58:19.258]  It doesn't matter.
[00:58:19.818 --> 00:58:26.402]  But if you fund us, we won't be an 800-foot giant attacking the globalist operation, because they're big.
[00:58:26.422 --> 00:58:27.023]  They're bigger than us.
[00:58:27.867 --> 00:58:28.367]  We'll grow.
[00:58:29.147 --> 00:58:32.648]  And it'll only give us more power when we 100% smash into the enemy.
[00:58:33.268 --> 00:58:35.049]  With truth and justice committed.
[00:58:35.749 --> 00:58:37.729]  I am ready to throw myself against the enemy.
[00:58:37.909 --> 00:58:39.730]  I am here to fight.
[00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:40.730]  Join us.
[00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:43.511]  Infowarslive.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:43.531 --> 00:58:45.011]  Get in there, buy the products.
[00:58:45.191 --> 00:58:46.472]  You're funding the war machine.
[00:58:46.792 --> 00:58:48.052]  It's called an Info War.
[00:58:50.173 --> 00:58:51.473]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:51.533 --> 00:58:54.874]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:59.631 --> 00:59:00.151]  I want more candy!
[00:59:00.171 --> 00:59:01.272]  I want more video games!
[00:59:01.332 --> 00:59:01.452]  Mine!
[00:59:01.532 --> 00:59:01.712]  Mine!
[00:59:01.932 --> 00:59:02.092]  Mine!
[00:59:02.853 --> 00:59:12.237]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:59:12.577 --> 00:59:15.138]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:59:15.278 --> 00:59:18.640]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:24.863]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[00:59:25.163 --> 00:59:27.684]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[00:59:27.864 --> 00:59:30.005]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:59:30.285 --> 00:59:36.448]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:59:36.668 --> 00:59:44.152]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[00:59:44.412 --> 00:59:51.675]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:55.217]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:55.557 --> 00:59:57.258]  That's ChildEase exclusively.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.201]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.121 --> 01:00:14.085]  Came in last night at half past ten That baby of mine wouldn't let me in
[01:00:27.995 --> 01:00:29.856]  You know why I'm so excited and so crazed?
[01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:33.559]  I mean, we're just living in epic, epic times.
[01:00:33.619 --> 01:00:34.659]  Legendary times.
[01:00:34.699 --> 01:00:37.822]  The best of times, the worst of times.
[01:00:54.693 --> 01:00:58.395]  Daria, originally from Russia, was just translating this amazing clip.
[01:00:58.455 --> 01:01:02.478]  If you just joined us, we've got Lord Monckton coming up with a recap on the big global government treaty.
[01:01:02.878 --> 01:01:04.079]  What exactly happened in Paris?
[01:01:04.099 --> 01:01:05.400]  They've been pretty quiet about it.
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:07.221]  Which spells defeat, doesn't it?
[01:01:07.281 --> 01:01:08.442]  We'll get to the tale straight ahead.
[01:01:09.542 --> 01:01:12.444]  Then, Liane McAdoo is going to be in studio on the disgusting budget.
[01:01:12.724 --> 01:01:13.725]  Paul Ryan and more.
[01:01:15.746 --> 01:01:21.350]  ABC News, Washington Post poll highlights opposition is the highest ever to assault weapons ban.
[01:01:22.947 --> 01:01:24.768]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:01:25.229 --> 01:01:32.474]  The problem is they're going into their high-tech fortresses politically and are going to use a lot of high-tech brainwashing on the public and are going to really dirty tactics now.
[01:01:33.975 --> 01:01:35.876]  Which will only be used against them in the end.
[01:01:37.418 --> 01:01:38.458]  But it's going to get rough, folks.
[01:01:39.419 --> 01:01:40.080]  It's going to get rough.
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.222]  I'm telling you, history's being made right now.
[01:01:44.182 --> 01:01:49.046]  Those of you taking action are in a fight even more important than our forebearers in 1776.
[01:01:52.844 --> 01:01:58.252]  Daria, let's play this clip one more time with your live breakdown of Putin calls Trump an outstanding, talented man.
[01:01:58.672 --> 01:02:01.897]  And then I'm going to get to what Trump said a few weeks ago here on the show about Putin.
[01:02:02.558 --> 01:02:03.059]  All right, here we go.
[01:02:04.405 --> 01:02:06.566]  What do you think of Donald Trump?
[01:02:06.606 --> 01:02:11.009]  Well, he's a very bright personality, a very talented person, without a doubt.
[01:02:11.449 --> 01:02:17.653]  But it's not our job to judge his virtues and merits, but it's the job of the voters of the United States.
[01:02:18.233 --> 01:02:20.995]  But he's an absolute leader in the race for the presidency.
[01:02:21.435 --> 01:02:28.098]  He says that he wants to have a deeper relationship between us, to reach new levels of cooperation.
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:31.640]  How can we not support that?
[01:02:32.241 --> 01:02:33.982]  Of course we support that.
[01:02:34.522 --> 01:02:45.748]  But when it comes to the internal politics, the way he uses his words, how popular he is, again, I repeat that it is not our business to judge his work on that level.
[01:02:46.568 --> 01:02:51.851]  Putin as usual, teleprompter free, boom, gets a question from American and Russian, nails it.
[01:02:52.831 --> 01:02:53.912]  And then says, boom, that's it.
[01:02:55.751 --> 01:03:05.118]  And it's not that Putin's perfect, but compared to the scum that run our country, that don't want us to have kids, that don't want us to have prosperity, that hate America, because they're globalist.
[01:03:05.378 --> 01:03:06.339]  Putin's a Russian!
[01:03:07.559 --> 01:03:09.881]  And a lot of old-timers don't trust him because he was in the KGB.
[01:03:10.141 --> 01:03:12.643]  What are you going to be in if you grow up in that country and you're talented?
[01:03:14.444 --> 01:03:16.045]  And again, trust but verify.
[01:03:16.146 --> 01:03:17.607]  I don't completely trust Vladimir Putin.
[01:03:18.707 --> 01:03:20.028]  But he gets the stage.
[01:03:20.068 --> 01:03:21.089]  He knows where the world is.
[01:03:21.509 --> 01:03:23.591]  He understands globalism is meant to destroy his country.
[01:03:24.912 --> 01:03:27.275]  So he gets better and better, like Donald Trump.
[01:03:28.356 --> 01:03:31.740]  Because it's the Age of Awakening right now.
[01:03:33.542 --> 01:03:35.064]  And people know more than they used to.
[01:03:36.626 --> 01:03:40.050]  Let's go ahead and go to Trump with his take on my show about Pootie.
[01:03:41.124 --> 01:03:48.068]  Can you speak to, as President, what your relationship would be with foreign leaders and what you know about Vladimir Putin?
[01:03:48.108 --> 01:03:52.071]  Because all I know is, why are we starting a fight with Russia when they're not doing anything to us?
[01:03:52.951 --> 01:03:54.552]  I think I get along great with people.
[01:03:54.592 --> 01:03:56.494]  I mean, I will probably get along well with him.
[01:03:56.534 --> 01:03:57.914]  And if I don't, somebody else will.
[01:03:57.975 --> 01:03:58.695]  And who knows?
[01:03:58.715 --> 01:03:59.976]  You know, he's a difficult cookie.
[01:04:00.476 --> 01:04:01.557]  He's tough and he's smart.
[01:04:01.717 --> 01:04:04.599]  I was on the show 60 Minutes with him recently.
[01:04:05.359 --> 01:04:06.039]  Not together.
[01:04:06.099 --> 01:04:08.981]  I mean, they did him and they profiled me at the same show, which was there.
[01:04:09.001 --> 01:04:10.081]  We were stablemates, right?
[01:04:10.502 --> 01:04:12.563]  But I think I'd get along very well with him.
[01:04:12.603 --> 01:04:13.683]  I think it'd do fine.
[01:04:13.703 --> 01:04:15.084]  Look, here's the thing.
[01:04:15.464 --> 01:04:18.266]  We lose with every country, and yet we don't get along with any countries.
[01:04:18.366 --> 01:04:19.446]  China is killing us.
[01:04:19.646 --> 01:04:20.687]  Everybody's killing us.
[01:04:20.847 --> 01:04:22.908]  China's just beating us to a pulp and trade.
[01:04:22.968 --> 01:04:26.750]  Japan, Mexico is killing us, and yet we don't get along with anybody.
[01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:28.772]  With me, they're not going to get so rich.
[01:04:28.852 --> 01:04:30.814]  Believe me, they're not going to get so rich at all.
[01:04:31.074 --> 01:04:32.255]  We're going to take back our jobs.
[01:04:32.275 --> 01:04:33.817]  We're going to take back our manufacture.
[01:04:33.857 --> 01:04:34.858]  We take back our base.
[01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:37.240]  But they'll like us more than they do now.
[01:04:38.261 --> 01:04:38.962]  Sort of amazing.
[01:04:39.861 --> 01:04:40.802]  He knows how it works.
[01:04:41.142 --> 01:04:45.664]  And not the Mexican people, but the Mexican elites have more billionaires per capita than any other country in the world.
[01:04:45.704 --> 01:04:47.185]  They literally own those people.
[01:04:47.786 --> 01:04:49.707]  And with our elite, they are screwing Americans.
[01:04:50.047 --> 01:04:52.428]  He points that out and they go, oh, he's racist against Mexico.
[01:04:52.748 --> 01:04:52.969]  No!
[01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:56.030]  America winning is not racist.
[01:04:56.110 --> 01:04:56.951]  It's not bad.
[01:04:57.691 --> 01:05:02.514]  It's this idea that we're a floor mat at somebody's door to be crapped on.
[01:05:02.654 --> 01:05:03.235]  And we're not.
[01:05:04.055 --> 01:05:07.137]  If that's political correctness, lay down, die, let us run your life.
[01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:10.101]  The L.A.
[01:05:10.121 --> 01:05:19.143]  Police and private security are targeting random people with stop-and-frisk searches on public sidewalks before the premiere of Star Wars The Force Awakens.
[01:05:19.403 --> 01:05:26.045]  Police have also installed metal detectors on the sidewalks near the famous TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood, California.
[01:05:26.625 --> 01:05:30.466]  Someone took to Twitter to post a picture of a Wookiee having his back searched.
[01:05:30.706 --> 01:05:35.327]  The caption reads, Security will be tight for the latest hashtag Star Wars premiere tonight.
[01:05:35.587 --> 01:05:37.168]  Metal detectors have been set up.
[01:05:37.768 --> 01:05:48.491]  TMZ reported, LAPD and private security officers are already blanketing several square blocks around the famed Chinese theater where the Force Awakens event is going down.
[01:05:48.851 --> 01:05:54.593]  We've learned anyone strolling through the area could be searched, frisked, and even wanted with metal detectors.
[01:05:55.013 --> 01:06:02.376]  In other words, even people not associated with the event who are simply passing through a public area are subject to a warrantless search.
[01:06:02.956 --> 01:06:05.717]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[01:07:09.477 --> 01:07:18.721]  Infowarslife and Infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:07:18.961 --> 01:07:23.563]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:07:23.663 --> 01:07:28.045]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:31.346]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[01:07:31.486 --> 01:07:33.587]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[01:07:33.907 --> 01:07:37.328]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[01:07:37.468 --> 01:07:41.610]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:44.871]  The research and development took over two years, but the result is
[01:07:45.031 --> 01:07:50.033]  As verified by Independent Laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[01:07:50.393 --> 01:07:55.136]  Read the facts at InfoWarsLife.com about Winter Sun vitamin D3.
[01:07:55.416 --> 01:08:01.038]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[01:08:01.358 --> 01:08:03.139]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[01:08:03.499 --> 01:08:06.121]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[01:08:23.650 --> 01:08:29.974]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:30.274 --> 01:08:36.918]  Well, they're saying the plot of the new Star Wars movie follows basically globalist world government operations here.
[01:08:38.118 --> 01:08:45.823]  The last one, Episode 3, the prequel, was a mirror of the Machiavellian operations used by the globalists to destabilize the planet.
[01:08:46.243 --> 01:08:51.366]  So we got Rob Doo talking about that some in the fourth hour today, and a special report I did on Jeb Bush.
[01:08:52.512 --> 01:08:55.715]  And his family's connection to being the head Nazi lawyers in the U.S.
[01:08:56.396 --> 01:09:03.042]  and working with Neville Chamberlain and, of course, Joseph Kennedy, who was pretty much a Nazi agent.
[01:09:03.843 --> 01:09:06.045]  This is in Mainline Books, Mainline History.
[01:09:06.085 --> 01:09:07.286]  It's not popularly known.
[01:09:07.306 --> 01:09:13.192]  I'm not here to demonize the Kennedys, but JFK's diary, you know, is how much he loved Hitler.
[01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:14.313]  So that's all out there.
[01:09:16.704 --> 01:09:19.648]  And it just shows you how dangerous fascism can be.
[01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:21.591]  That's why Jeb Bush is disqualified.
[01:09:21.951 --> 01:09:24.715]  You don't just think his daddy became the director of the CIA overnight.
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:28.901]  Never being in the CIA.
[01:09:33.163 --> 01:09:35.784]  So, Lord Moxley is with us until about 40 after.
[01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:39.085]  Then when he leaves us, I'm going to get into Sweden.
[01:09:39.485 --> 01:09:41.285]  The Muslims are murdering gay people.
[01:09:41.345 --> 01:09:42.946]  That story is up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:09:43.286 --> 01:09:44.766]  It's an Infowars.com article.
[01:09:45.546 --> 01:09:49.327]  Fox News reports, lawmakers clash over refugees.
[01:09:49.947 --> 01:09:54.569]  Syrian information, immigration, quietly tops 100,000.
[01:09:56.434 --> 01:09:57.275]  So that's how many are here.
[01:09:57.555 --> 01:10:00.917]  Saudi Arabia orders execution of teen for attending protest.
[01:10:01.678 --> 01:10:06.301]  Progressive media argues that thanks to ISIS we have to consider limits to free speech.
[01:10:06.701 --> 01:10:12.005]  And France is considering prosecuting Marie Le Pen for tweeting about violent Islamic state images.
[01:10:12.045 --> 01:10:13.946]  She's one of the presidential frontrunners right now.
[01:10:15.567 --> 01:10:16.648]  Her party just won elections.
[01:10:18.592 --> 01:10:22.435]  We're also with Leanne McAdoo at about 40 after she's going to be in here.
[01:10:22.455 --> 01:10:26.839]  33 after, but after Moncton leaves, she's going to get into the budget.
[01:10:26.899 --> 01:10:29.241]  Congress, half a trillion dollar spending binge.
[01:10:30.842 --> 01:10:33.304]  Putin calls Trump an outstanding, talented man.
[01:10:33.344 --> 01:10:36.046]  Says he wants a relationship with Russia, so how could they be against that?
[01:10:36.627 --> 01:10:38.909]  Fed, of course, raises the rate by 25 basis points.
[01:10:39.329 --> 01:10:40.430]  Says they'll go up more.
[01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:41.350]  We'll break that down.
[01:10:41.651 --> 01:10:45.033]  Bionic eye could restore sight and give hope to thousands of blind people.
[01:10:46.087 --> 01:10:48.328]  Really exciting technological news.
[01:10:48.388 --> 01:10:51.389]  Hopefully it can transcend the tyranny and the new dark ages with it.
[01:10:51.409 --> 01:10:55.591]  I just want to say Merry Christmas again because they're trying to ban that so many places.
[01:10:56.211 --> 01:10:58.692]  Yale students signed petition to repeal the First Amendment.
[01:11:00.233 --> 01:11:03.234]  That's a new video we'll get to also in the third hour today.
[01:11:04.534 --> 01:11:08.056]  But I wanted to get Lord Monckton on, who is the leading
[01:11:10.169 --> 01:11:17.596]  Exposure of man-made ice age being a fraud back in the 80s and man-made global warming in the 90s and 2000s being a fraud.
[01:11:17.616 --> 01:11:19.939]  Now climate change so they can't be proven wrong.
[01:11:20.279 --> 01:11:23.202]  They just claim, you know, the seasons are actually not normal.
[01:11:24.443 --> 01:11:25.484]  I don't want to get into the science.
[01:11:25.544 --> 01:11:26.045]  He's done that.
[01:11:26.105 --> 01:11:26.805]  He's conquered that.
[01:11:26.825 --> 01:11:27.906]  He's got peer-reviewed journals.
[01:11:27.947 --> 01:11:30.949]  He's a top journalist, inventor, Margaret Thatcher's chief advisor.
[01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:32.271]  I don't need to go into his pedigree.
[01:11:33.766 --> 01:11:35.267]  But you got Ben Stein on Fox.
[01:11:35.307 --> 01:11:36.288]  Nothing against Ben Stein.
[01:11:36.628 --> 01:11:38.149]  He's like, could it be a hoax?
[01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:39.670]  And it's like a bold courage.
[01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:41.011]  That's so-called conservatism.
[01:11:41.231 --> 01:11:41.952]  Could it be a hoax?
[01:11:41.972 --> 01:11:43.453]  I don't know.
[01:11:43.473 --> 01:11:44.794]  Do polar bears have white fur?
[01:11:46.995 --> 01:11:48.216]  Is Al Gore a man-bear pig?
[01:11:48.577 --> 01:11:49.958]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:11:50.498 --> 01:11:52.700]  When even conservatives won't come out and say it's a fraud.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.201]  Only Senator Inhofe will.
[01:11:54.841 --> 01:11:55.902]  And that scene is radical.
[01:11:55.982 --> 01:11:56.742]  It's not radical.
[01:11:56.802 --> 01:12:01.306]  It's an admitted conspiracy to take over the world with carbon taxes and run our lives.
[01:12:02.156 --> 01:12:04.797]  A new dark age, unevenly distributed.
[01:12:05.817 --> 01:12:09.299]  So I want Lord Monckton with his gravitas to tell us what happened.
[01:12:09.319 --> 01:12:10.259]  They're not bragging about it.
[01:12:10.279 --> 01:12:11.200]  They're not talking about it.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.880]  They're trying to hide it.
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.161]  So does that mean a big failure?
[01:12:14.201 --> 01:12:15.181]  They're always so secretive.
[01:12:15.241 --> 01:12:21.704]  What really happened at this king of world government summits, the most world leaders ever in any meeting, he was there to cover it.
[01:12:22.384 --> 01:12:23.565]  What are we facing next?
[01:12:23.665 --> 01:12:24.845]  Implementation by stealth.
[01:12:25.385 --> 01:12:26.386]  Is this a big victory?
[01:12:26.786 --> 01:12:29.487]  And then I want to move on to other geopolitical issues.
[01:12:29.868 --> 01:12:39.192]  The attempt to basically shut down UKIP that he helped promote, that he's part of, to help shut down other parties in Europe that just call for basic sanity.
[01:12:39.532 --> 01:12:41.693]  So Lord Christopher Monckton, I guess you're back now.
[01:12:41.713 --> 01:12:42.274]  Are you in London?
[01:12:42.294 --> 01:12:43.354]  Are you in Scotland?
[01:12:43.594 --> 01:12:44.194]  Where are you now?
[01:12:44.234 --> 01:12:44.875]  You were in Paris.
[01:12:45.115 --> 01:12:46.796]  I'm in Scotland.
[01:12:46.856 --> 01:12:51.258]  I've been to Paris and then I went to a very good climate conference in Essen in Germany.
[01:12:52.302 --> 01:12:57.305]  And I'm now back in Edinburgh and ready to resume the battle from here.
[01:12:57.785 --> 01:13:01.788]  And let's start, if I may, with that Paris Climate Agreement.
[01:13:02.208 --> 01:13:14.536]  The first thing you need to know in the United States is that whatever the Obama administration tries to say, this agreement does constitute a treaty at United States law.
[01:13:15.336 --> 01:13:16.076]  And when the
[01:13:17.077 --> 01:13:31.587]  When the original UN Framework Convention was voted on, there was an agreement between the executive branch and the Senate as to what did and did not constitute a treaty in this sphere.
[01:13:32.427 --> 01:13:48.134]  And this document, which does impose, albeit in a rather voluntary way, various obligations on the United States, does within that definition, agreed between the executive branch and the Senate, constitute a treaty.
[01:13:48.814 --> 01:13:51.615]  It therefore has no legal effect
[01:13:51.895 --> 01:14:02.462]  Whatsoever in the United States unless and until the Senate by a two-thirds majority has ratified it as a treaty under the terms of your Constitution.
[01:14:02.862 --> 01:14:04.663]  That's the first thing you need to know, Alex.
[01:14:04.983 --> 01:14:06.124]  This is a treaty.
[01:14:06.404 --> 01:14:14.449]  Mr. Obama cannot enforce it or act upon it in any way unless and until the Senate by a two-thirds majority has ratified it.
[01:14:14.729 --> 01:14:18.432]  And I can tell you from my knowledge of the Senators that they're not going to do that.
[01:14:20.239 --> 01:14:38.966]  But of course, as you know, six years ago, Congress shut down his carbon tax initiative and greenhouse cap, but still, not by stealth, but openly, via executive fiat, he commenced a shutdown over a thousand power plants, doubling overall electrical prices, crippling our economy.
[01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:58.402]  This is, I think, a huge problem, both in Britain, where they're planning to phase out all coal-fired power altogether, even though it's the cheapest, most reliable, and these days, the cleanest form of generating electricity, does less harm to the environment than anything else bar none, but they're going to close that down.
[01:14:59.102 --> 01:15:03.944]  This has now become a kind of religion for those who don't have religion.
[01:15:03.984 --> 01:15:08.946]  Jay Lehr of the Heartland Institute sent round a very interesting email to me just a few days ago.
[01:15:09.006 --> 01:15:20.131]  He said that he notices that the reason why most of the audiences to which he speaks don't believe that there's a problem with the climate is that they've all got a religion of their own already and they don't need this new one.
[01:15:20.151 --> 01:15:20.571]  That's right.
[01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:22.612]  And it has become a religion.
[01:15:23.032 --> 01:15:25.653]  Or really, let us be very clear about this.
[01:15:25.693 --> 01:15:37.155]  There's a distinction between a religion, which may or may not be true, and we can't prove it either way, and a superstition, which can be, and in the case of global warming has been, proven to be false.
[01:15:37.255 --> 01:15:41.096]  After all, there's been no global warming now for 18 years, 9 months.
[01:15:41.636 --> 01:15:46.397]  The rate of warming on all five of the major data sets since 1990 is well below
[01:15:49.958 --> 01:15:50.939]  The lowest prediction.
[01:15:50.959 --> 01:15:51.820]  Sure, we know that, sir.
[01:15:51.961 --> 01:15:52.882]  And you've documented it.
[01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:53.703]  It's on record.
[01:15:53.763 --> 01:15:55.264]  They got caught hiding the decline.
[01:15:55.685 --> 01:15:57.587]  Devastating victories five years ago.
[01:15:58.028 --> 01:15:59.069]  People understand that.
[01:15:59.149 --> 01:16:00.351]  And I mean, you talk about a religion.
[01:16:00.391 --> 01:16:01.812]  It's a religion where they're the high priest.
[01:16:02.153 --> 01:16:03.454]  We pay them indulgences.
[01:16:04.155 --> 01:16:06.057]  We've now got the Pope trying to get in on it.
[01:16:06.778 --> 01:16:08.279]  By the way, how is that going?
[01:16:08.319 --> 01:16:09.060]  I know you're a Catholic.
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:10.662]  I have a lot of great Catholic friends, great people.
[01:16:10.682 --> 01:16:14.605]  I know there's been a big backlash against the Pope and his behavior.
[01:16:15.366 --> 01:16:21.251]  What do you make of his offensive to try to get everybody to sign on to the Paris deal?
[01:16:21.451 --> 01:16:22.612]  Looks like that didn't go too well.
[01:16:23.833 --> 01:16:25.014]  I think that no, it didn't.
[01:16:25.034 --> 01:16:27.155]  The Paris deal actually is a bit of a failure.
[01:16:27.195 --> 01:16:29.716]  First of all, it isn't legally binding.
[01:16:30.056 --> 01:16:40.960]  There are those who try to say, including the Obama administration, that because the treaty imposes obligations, it isn't really a treaty because it isn't legally binding.
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:42.621]  Well, it isn't legally binding.
[01:16:43.331 --> 01:16:52.181]  And the reason why is that I, among others, argued for many years that there should be what's called a cessation clause.
[01:16:52.221 --> 01:16:59.550]  Now this wasn't in the original draft of the treaty, but it was put in in the second draft and we've managed to keep it in in all subsequent drafts.
[01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:03.835]  And it reads much the same as the similar clause in the Kyoto Protocol.
[01:17:04.355 --> 01:17:14.082]  Of 1997, which Canada and various other countries have already taken advantage of to leave this process, and now that secession clause has been put into this treaty too.
[01:17:14.382 --> 01:17:32.395]  And what that means is that any nation that finally wakes up, comes off the Kool-Aid, and realizes that global warming is not happening and isn't going to happen, anything like the originally predicted rate, they can now walk away without any penalty, and all they have to do to achieve that is to give a single year's notice.
[01:17:32.735 --> 01:17:33.256]  So it's really
[01:17:34.256 --> 01:17:35.498]  Quite a feeble document.
[01:17:35.979 --> 01:17:43.828]  And indeed they haven't even been able to narrow down what the target amount of... So they are being forced then to go into a stealth mode is what you're saying?
[01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:54.065]  What they're doing is they have now, this was the high point, this is the high tide mark on the scum-filled bath of water, if you like.
[01:17:54.345 --> 01:17:59.487]  This is the highest that the global warming extremists are going to achieve.
[01:17:59.527 --> 01:18:03.929]  From here on in, the water is running out of the bath, all it leaves is a little bit of scum behind.
[01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:09.412]  So this is a death rattle, a dead cat bounce, as they bounce down the ravine towards their final end.
[01:18:10.202 --> 01:18:21.893]  That's right, it's still costing now, I think the latest estimate is one and a half trillion dollars a year worldwide in people having to pay extra for their electricity and their gasoline purely because of this global warming nonsense.
[01:18:21.953 --> 01:18:34.464]  After all the prices, raw material prices of coal, oil and gas have all fallen in recent years and have fallen very rapidly in the last year or so and yet electricity prices are double or triple what they were ten years ago.
[01:18:34.484 --> 01:18:35.886]  And Spain's been totally bankrupted?
[01:18:36.606 --> 01:18:39.548]  I mean, as they admit, and of course you warn their own government.
[01:18:39.928 --> 01:18:42.330]  Just to go back to something you said earlier, though, because that's not just a claim.
[01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:57.119]  They admit that modern UK, US, Japanese coal plants, nothing comes out, nothing, but water vapor and carbon dioxide, and then they tell us they're horrible and dirty, when it is the cleanest energy there is.
[01:18:58.243 --> 01:18:59.504]  That is exactly right.
[01:18:59.544 --> 01:19:06.550]  You see, what happens now is that inside these coal-fired plants, they have two principal methods of technology.
[01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:15.458]  One of them was invented by a friend of mine at Cambridge, who was an engineer there in the science department, and he invented a thing called fluidized bed combustion.
[01:19:16.079 --> 01:19:24.927]  And this is a very efficient way of taking either pulverized or pelletized coal, and you make it into a kind of fluid, and it burns very, very efficiently.
[01:19:25.347 --> 01:19:30.113]  And the boilers are now so efficient that they're literally 99.5% efficient.
[01:19:30.133 --> 01:19:34.358]  The odd 0.5% is just a little bit of conduction of heat through the walls of the boiler.
[01:19:34.859 --> 01:19:36.420]  Otherwise it's completely efficient.
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.763]  It's the most efficient way of generating electricity.
[01:19:40.305 --> 01:19:42.987]  That's where coal got discovered and used there and in Germany.
[01:19:43.347 --> 01:19:56.056]  What a crime to have England that literally invented the modern world's coal systems being shut down where you won't have any of it, but India and China and Mexico can have the most old, fuming, stinking plants and build new ones.
[01:19:56.396 --> 01:19:58.037]  It is a crime against our nations.
[01:19:58.277 --> 01:20:00.519]  I want to ask you why they want to shut down the West.
[01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:06.863]  On the other side, Lord Christopher Monckton, scienceandpublicpolicy.org is the key website.
[01:20:07.103 --> 01:20:07.524]  Stay with us.
[01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:12.613]  Still wondering what to get that special someone that has everything?
[01:20:12.873 --> 01:20:22.661]  At ID Stronghold, we still find that a huge percentage of people do not yet have an RFID blocking wallet or purse to protect them from the new and growing threat of electronic pickpocketing.
[01:20:23.021 --> 01:20:36.373]  That's right, even though 40% of all new chipped payment cards shipped in 2014 contain a wireless interface called RFID that allows the account information to be skimmed by a thief passing near your cards, most people are still unprotected.
[01:20:36.733 --> 01:20:42.098]  The good news is that ID Stronghold makes luxurious leather wallets and other products that prevent this.
[01:20:42.478 --> 01:20:51.165]  ID Stronghold founded the entire RFID protection industry and has been protecting the RFID chips in government and military ID cards for over a decade.

[01:24:14.437 --> 01:24:18.561]  You know, I'm chomping at the bit, and the better it gets is sometimes the more I interrupt.
[01:24:19.242 --> 01:24:23.806]  And it's because it's just so incredible how criminal these people are.
[01:24:24.968 --> 01:24:26.469]  And then they want to arrest us.
[01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:30.933]  And then you've got all these big oil companies lined up to shut down coal.
[01:24:31.074 --> 01:24:32.255]  I have no investment in coal.
[01:24:32.355 --> 01:24:33.736]  Zero money in my life from coal.
[01:24:36.059 --> 01:24:37.080]  But I know the science.
[01:24:38.697 --> 01:24:48.723]  And I watch the average middle class person or poor working person see their prices in the United States in the last seven years double for electricity, even as other energy prices go down.
[01:24:50.204 --> 01:24:51.784]  And the elite know what they're doing.
[01:24:53.385 --> 01:25:01.370]  I mean, Prince Charles literally has his palace the seat of a taxpayer money, but he doesn't want people in the UK to have cheap coal power.
[01:25:03.704 --> 01:25:12.686]  And it's just a hypocrisy of hundreds and hundreds of giant private jets, caviar, thousand-dollar meals, huge carbon footprints, lecturing us at Paris.
[01:25:13.166 --> 01:25:16.386]  Lord Monckton, do these people know how ridiculous they look?
[01:25:17.527 --> 01:25:19.747]  I mean, you know them well, you've been tracking them for decades.
[01:25:20.027 --> 01:25:21.047]  Who are these elites?
[01:25:21.347 --> 01:25:22.267]  What's their problem?
[01:25:22.507 --> 01:25:24.388]  Why do they have such ill will to people?
[01:25:24.668 --> 01:25:29.189]  Why do they want to shut down our development and growth when development cleans things up?
[01:25:29.509 --> 01:25:30.449]  What's their problem?
[01:25:31.169 --> 01:25:33.671]  This is a very old problem.
[01:25:33.711 --> 01:25:36.394]  It's known as Trahison d'Éclair in French.
[01:25:36.974 --> 01:25:42.620]  It's a betrayal by the governing class, and this time, for the first time, it's a global betrayal by the governing class.
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:52.469]  The governing class tends always to act in its own interest, and it tends also always to be largely dictatorial, largely totalitarian.
[01:25:52.609 --> 01:25:53.469]  It wants to govern.
[01:25:54.230 --> 01:26:00.934]  So, when they get a subject like climate change, they come along and they grab at this and they seize it, and it makes them feel important.
[01:26:00.994 --> 01:26:03.256]  We are the people who are here at this historic juncture.
[01:26:03.276 --> 01:26:07.939]  We are going to save the world from itself, at your expense and mine, of course.
[01:26:08.079 --> 01:26:10.180]  It won't be paying for this, it'll be profiting from it.
[01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:12.602]  So there's a large profit motive in this.
[01:26:13.002 --> 01:26:16.164]  There's a large area of self-aggrandizement.
[01:26:16.704 --> 01:26:22.650]  And I think with Prince Charles, frankly, the point is that the monarchy in Britain is not an absolute monarchy.
[01:26:22.690 --> 01:26:24.151]  It's a constitutional monarchy.
[01:26:24.191 --> 01:26:30.597]  It's a monarchy in which, effectively, as far as politics is concerned, the monarch has no real official role.
[01:26:31.278 --> 01:26:36.242]  As a result, Charles has always been looking for ways in which to make himself seem relevant.
[01:26:36.983 --> 01:26:44.148]  And he knows that the only way to make himself seem relevant to the left at the moment is to pretend to believe in all this global warming stuff.
[01:26:44.729 --> 01:26:52.294]  Now, he's not the brightest shilling in the bank, so he's not really understanding the science.
[01:26:52.314 --> 01:26:59.279]  He's not one of those who... that small number who know perfectly well that this is nonsense, but are saying that it's true anyway.
[01:26:59.759 --> 01:27:05.964]  And those are the ones that we are now going after, because in Prague a few months ago, a new outfit was set up.
[01:27:06.824 --> 01:27:17.990]  Called the International Geoethics Committee to bring back elementary standards of ethics and honesty and probity into the earth sciences, including the climate sciences.
[01:27:18.430 --> 01:27:24.673]  And I've been asked to set up a fraud investigation team because we are now looking at this as fraud.
[01:27:25.054 --> 01:27:27.355]  And we are looking with some interest, I may say,
[01:27:28.115 --> 01:27:31.477]  At some of the so-called initiatives set up by Prince Charles.
[01:27:31.877 --> 01:27:34.698]  And they too, some of those may be frauds.
[01:27:34.758 --> 01:27:35.819]  Let it be clear.
[01:27:35.839 --> 01:27:39.680]  The son of the monarch may be guilty of fraud.
[01:27:40.101 --> 01:27:42.302]  He has established, for instance, a thing called the...
[01:27:43.962 --> 01:28:05.208]  Climate change law initiative and the aim of this initiative is to bully and pester and drag into court innocent corporations on the ground that in his opinion they are not kowtowing to the climate change orthodoxy to which he subscribes.
[01:28:05.728 --> 01:28:08.249]  Now the danger in getting into that route
[01:28:08.909 --> 01:28:37.622]  is that any court case that eventually happened would look very carefully at the evidence for whether or not there really is a problem with the climate when that evidence is is considered as it was for instance in the Al Gore case in the uh... London High Court in 2007 when his film I wrote the scientific testimony he was found uh... by the court to have committed nine errors as the court called them serious errors of science and the court would have banned the film unless the
[01:28:38.542 --> 01:28:47.370]  Department of Education, against whom a trucker in Dartford brought the case because he didn't want his kids exposed to what was rank political propaganda.
[01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:58.439]  The judge would have banned the film, and he said he would have banned it, unless the department had agreed to circulate 77 pages of corrective guidance to every school in England before the movie was shown.
[01:28:58.679 --> 01:29:02.222]  Now, of course, very few kids ever get told that that guidance exists.
[01:29:02.242 --> 01:29:03.624]  This was really a way of the judge
[01:29:04.204 --> 01:29:09.688]  Having to admit there was something wrong with the film, but not being prepared actually to go so far as to ban it.
[01:29:10.028 --> 01:29:19.914]  But nevertheless, the point is established that if you take cases like this to court, as Prince Charles is now saying he wants to do, he is going to get a very great surprise.
[01:29:20.234 --> 01:29:29.921]  Because if you bring a case to court vexatiously and frivolously, you can end up being cited for contempt, and worse still, even for fraud.
[01:29:30.841 --> 01:29:35.803]  Which you've been saying for years they won't really do it and they don't because in any real court they're afraid.
[01:29:35.843 --> 01:29:39.165]  It's all bluster to make them sound official and imply we're criminal.
[01:29:39.405 --> 01:29:45.808]  But the truth is we're trying to get them in court and you do get them into court and routinely slice them into little chunks.
[01:29:46.248 --> 01:29:53.451]  I want to come back and talk about their latest propaganda blitzes and other offensives that you've researched that you believe they're preparing to launch.
[01:29:54.071 --> 01:29:58.595]  Straight ahead, future intel on how we continue to win the war against these frauds.
[01:29:58.936 --> 01:29:59.836]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.337 --> 01:30:02.539]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.859 --> 01:30:05.562]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:11.514 --> 01:30:13.757]  Christmas has come early, thanks to Congress.
[01:30:14.017 --> 01:30:19.764]  The new tax break package being voted on this week will cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years.
[01:30:20.104 --> 01:30:23.488]  And it sees presents for NASCAR, horse racing, and more.
[01:30:23.728 --> 01:30:24.489]  But that's not all.
[01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:26.231]  The 233-page bill is one of two parts of legislation.
[01:30:28.954 --> 01:30:36.303]  New House Speaker Paul Ryan unveiled on Wednesday, the other being a massive $1.1 trillion spending bill.
[01:30:36.784 --> 01:30:47.557]  In total, Congress's spending binge funds the climate deal, Planned Parenthood, makes it harder to repeal Obamacare, and a cybersecurity bill has even been hacked in for good measure.
[01:30:48.078 --> 01:30:52.280]  By the way, there's no plan for how to pay for this big fat budget buster.
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:31:03.925]  Both are expected to pass both Houses of Congress by the end of this week and signed into law by President Obama after he returns from a $3.7 million holiday vacation.
[01:31:04.285 --> 01:31:06.366]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[01:31:09.471 --> 01:31:12.694]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:12.994 --> 01:31:21.001]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:21.241 --> 01:31:26.265]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:31:26.665 --> 01:31:28.947]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:31:43.848 --> 01:31:47.809]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[01:31:47.989 --> 01:31:52.771]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[01:31:52.931 --> 01:31:57.452]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[01:31:57.472 --> 01:32:00.913]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.

[01:32:04.534 --> 01:32:06.355]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:09.136 --> 01:32:15.962]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[01:32:16.042 --> 01:32:18.744]  We've always offered five months free.
[01:32:18.944 --> 01:32:24.529]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[01:32:24.869 --> 01:32:28.012]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[01:32:28.272 --> 01:32:31.254]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[01:32:31.575 --> 01:32:34.297]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books,
[01:32:34.497 --> 01:32:34.977]  We're good to go.
[01:32:51.505 --> 01:32:58.907]  You can also sign up for a trial month and only pay $5.95, and then 20 of you and your friends and family can watch PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:59.067 --> 01:33:01.148]  Get 20 memberships at half price.
[01:33:01.328 --> 01:33:03.169]  Be the Paul Revere in your community.
[01:33:03.269 --> 01:33:06.790]  That's six months free when you sign up for a year at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:19.918 --> 01:33:22.121]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:22.561 --> 01:33:23.943]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.926 --> 01:33:40.828]  You can see the great crew, Matt Niko and Leanne McAdoo.
[01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:46.649]  She's in there in the control room getting ready to charge in here with a whole stack of breaking news and analysis.
[01:33:47.009 --> 01:33:49.610]  I haven't gotten into Martin Scurley.
[01:33:51.151 --> 01:33:53.992]  Gets a call from a special agent during YouTube live stream.
[01:33:54.012 --> 01:33:55.812]  He's the guy that increased drug prices 5,000 times.
[01:33:55.832 --> 01:33:56.052]  5,000 percent.
[01:33:56.072 --> 01:33:57.613]  He's now being arrested.
[01:34:02.412 --> 01:34:06.554]  So we're going to be talking about some of that coming up.
[01:34:07.054 --> 01:34:08.215]  Talk about arrogance.
[01:34:08.295 --> 01:34:10.276]  Talk about giving free market a bad name.
[01:34:11.476 --> 01:34:12.897]  5,000% drug increase?
[01:34:13.497 --> 01:34:16.219]  That guy looks like a sniveling villain.
[01:34:16.719 --> 01:34:20.561]  I mean, so many times the book cover really does match what's inside.
[01:34:21.481 --> 01:34:26.644]  When it comes to people, not with books, the cover of a book doesn't usually actually tell you what's in it, but people
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:27.980]  I don't know.
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:40.569]  I mean, if I was casting for like a sub-villain to say Dr. Evil, like a mini-me, that would, I think he would actually, I think he would actually get the job.
[01:34:41.505 --> 01:34:52.547]  Now, continuing, Lord Christopher Monckton, sir, we've got him for another five minutes or so, and I wish him a wonderful Christmas, and I just admire him as a true modern knight in shining armor out there.
[01:34:52.887 --> 01:35:09.551]  He could have easily joined with the dark side, with Sauron, and been part of the club, and enriched himself to a great extent, but instead, I know, he never talks about this, he has made great sacrifices in his businesses and career to follow these people around the world,
[01:35:10.311 --> 01:35:12.132]  Uh, and expose their, their fraud.
[01:35:12.152 --> 01:35:16.634]  Uh, and so that's why he's the most demonized person exposing man-made climate change.
[01:35:16.674 --> 01:35:26.419]  So we salute Lord Monckton here at the end of 2015 and wish him another, you know, 50 plus years here on Terra Firma because we know there'll be other dragons to slay.
[01:35:26.479 --> 01:35:28.840]  But, uh, thank you so much for all you do, Lord Monckton.
[01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:32.761]  Well, Alex, that's one of the nicest testimonials I've ever had.
[01:35:32.861 --> 01:35:35.161]  Please broadcast that on a continuous loop.
[01:35:35.721 --> 01:35:43.423]  And also, it's right that I should wish you and all your wonderful audience, I think it's now, what, 20 million people?
[01:35:44.263 --> 01:35:45.183]  Conservatively.
[01:35:45.243 --> 01:35:49.344]  All the very best for Christmas and the New Year, and I'm going to do what you do.
[01:35:49.484 --> 01:35:53.625]  I'm going to call it not Happy Holidays or Happy Hanukkah, I'm going to call it Happy Christmas.
[01:35:54.105 --> 01:36:02.717]  We are allowed to remember our own Christian heritage and we are also allowed to play the being offended game.
[01:36:03.177 --> 01:36:10.687]  I think we can say we are offended when we can't put up our Christmas trees and our Christmas lights because various people pretend that they're offended by them.
[01:36:10.968 --> 01:36:11.448]  They're not.
[01:36:12.029 --> 01:36:19.990]  And we should just carry on and put them up anyway, and let us vote out of office any more of these people who try to say we can't have Christmas.
[01:36:20.331 --> 01:36:25.251]  We can have it, we're a Christian country, we're going to keep up our traditions, and why shouldn't we?
[01:36:25.531 --> 01:36:31.633]  And that's, of course, there's your Christmas tree now, I'm delighted to see what a splendid one it is, in red, white and blue.
[01:36:31.893 --> 01:36:35.133]  It's a patriotic Christmas tree, so you've killed two birds with one stone.
[01:36:35.433 --> 01:36:36.293]  I like to see that.
[01:36:36.673 --> 01:36:39.074]  So very best to you, Alex, because you too,
[01:36:39.714 --> 01:36:46.237]  You are a fighter for freedom, and you too do not find it easy financially to keep this vast network going.
[01:36:46.537 --> 01:36:50.319]  It is difficult for us on the side of light and truth.
[01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:59.064]  But, as Mother Teresa of Calcutta used to say, there was never too much money for what she was doing, there was always just enough.
[01:36:59.524 --> 01:37:07.908]  And anyone who does the Lord's work, as Jim Inhofe called it in a video to us at the Heartland Conference which took place in Paris just a few days ago,
[01:37:08.508 --> 01:37:13.089]  Any of us who do the Lord's work will always find there's just enough for us to carry on doing it.
[01:37:13.209 --> 01:37:27.353]  You know, it really is providence that George Washington talked about, and of course Churchill talked about it as well, that every time doors close and we're attacked and we're in trouble, all of a sudden other doors literally magically pop open and we get just enough.
[01:37:27.754 --> 01:37:29.154]  I mean, it really is incredible.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.742]  That is exactly what happens, and it's been the same with me.
[01:37:33.762 --> 01:37:41.406]  You know, we're all living hand-to-mouth these days, thanks to the vast over-taxation we all have to endure, but we manage anyway.
[01:37:41.446 --> 01:37:44.507]  The point is that they are now in retreat.
[01:37:45.047 --> 01:37:55.893]  They're so desperate that at the climate conference, one of the delegates came up to me and he said, look, he said, all you sceptics, you've all got grey hair now.
[01:37:56.613 --> 01:38:00.694]  And he said, all we have to do is just wait and eventually you'll all be dead.
[01:38:01.214 --> 01:38:05.136]  And then we will rule the world and we will do away with capitalism altogether.
[01:38:05.156 --> 01:38:06.876]  Of course, this has got nothing to do with the climate.
[01:38:07.236 --> 01:38:12.758]  It's all about abolishing capitalism and bringing back an unholy mixture of fascism and communism.
[01:38:12.778 --> 01:38:14.658]  We might call it phasmunism.
[01:38:15.039 --> 01:38:17.419]  It's the new totalitarianism on the block.
[01:38:17.799 --> 01:38:19.660]  It's a very unpleasant form of government.
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:36.847]  And already the likes of Prince Charles are lining themselves up with this by saying that the likes of me, for daring to question this, even in a scientific journal, he is saying we should now be brought into court and prosecuted for daring to say that there is another side to the case.
[01:38:37.087 --> 01:38:40.849]  That's what his climate change law initiative is aiming to do.
[01:38:40.909 --> 01:38:45.231]  It's aiming to pester companies first and then, no doubt, individuals.
[01:38:45.871 --> 01:38:49.474]  And well, we will fight him, and we will fight him in court if necessary.
[01:38:49.955 --> 01:38:59.283]  Because if the only way to make him realize that if he goes on talking this nonsense, then he could get into trouble, is perhaps that he will have to face trial for fraud.
[01:38:59.583 --> 01:39:02.545]  He is not protected against trial.
[01:39:02.946 --> 01:39:10.913]  After all, there was a famous ancestor of his called King Charles I, who was tried at Whitehall and was executed.
[01:39:11.633 --> 01:39:30.438]  So he had better be very careful to stay within the constitutional constraints, which mean that on this heavily political subject, on which the largest party in the last European elections, and the party that grew the fastest in the last general elections, the United Kingdom Independence Party, has a view which is diametrically opposed to his own.
[01:39:30.458 --> 01:39:33.119]  And that brings me to my final question, Alure Monaghan.
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:38.303]  Because of time constraints, my final question, without even asking, you got into the censorship issue.
[01:39:38.844 --> 01:39:40.905]  Portland's calling for banning Trump's speech.
[01:39:41.446 --> 01:39:45.009]  The head of the ACLU in Colorado said murder his supporters, had to step down.
[01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:52.035]  They have new charges for LePen for talking bad about ISIS and sending out tweets against them.
[01:39:52.856 --> 01:39:54.517]  I mean, it's so brazen.
[01:39:54.557 --> 01:39:55.358]  It's so open.
[01:39:56.679 --> 01:40:07.964]  Uh, arrogant, how tyrannical these people openly are, and it really shows how dangerous they are and really what they're pushing for and what they want to do.
[01:40:07.984 --> 01:40:10.726]  I mean, have they really exposed themselves?
[01:40:12.031 --> 01:40:18.560]  They have, and indeed even the Supreme Court, so-called, here in the UK, just opposite Parliament.
[01:40:19.021 --> 01:40:20.022]  They have come out.
[01:40:20.062 --> 01:40:24.148]  They did a propaganda event on climate change just a few weeks ago.
[01:40:24.488 --> 01:40:29.015]  They're now refusing to answer Freedom of Information requests about it.
[01:40:29.455 --> 01:40:32.277]  And they are in breach of the law in doing that.
[01:40:32.317 --> 01:40:34.238]  And it's all about to end up in court.
[01:40:34.699 --> 01:40:40.883]  Because they too are trying to deny freedom of speech to anyone who dares to question the new orthodoxy.
[01:40:41.223 --> 01:40:43.905]  And they're saying there is no political debate about it.
[01:40:43.945 --> 01:40:46.307]  They're saying there is no political controversy.
[01:40:46.747 --> 01:40:48.527]  That's the new official line.
[01:40:48.747 --> 01:40:59.110]  The fact that the party that came at top in the European elections, and it's Europe that makes environmental and climate law for the United Kingdom, we don't really do it anymore.
[01:40:59.670 --> 01:41:07.432]  The fact that party totally disagrees with the official party line, that to the Supreme Court does not constitute political controversy.
[01:41:07.492 --> 01:41:13.693]  They say there is no political debate anymore on this subject and so they can come out and say what they like about it.
[01:41:14.173 --> 01:41:16.336]  They are about to discover that that is wrong.
[01:41:16.676 --> 01:41:33.975]  They either answer my Freedom of Information questions, or I will be taking them to court on judicial review of their failure to recuse the judge who, in particular, exhibited flagrant malice and bias in that propaganda event which they broadcast on YouTube.
[01:41:34.355 --> 01:41:35.836]  We're not taking prisoners here.
[01:41:36.036 --> 01:41:38.618]  We're going to send that judge to jail if necessary.
[01:41:38.858 --> 01:41:43.160]  We are not going to be bullied and we're not going to have our freedom of speech silenced.
[01:41:43.441 --> 01:41:46.122]  And let that be the same for you in the United States, Alex.
[01:41:46.442 --> 01:41:52.206]  We must fly the flag of freedom even as those who govern us try to tear it from our hands.
[01:41:52.606 --> 01:42:11.802]  Well, I've noticed, Lord Monckton, in closing, that in the past you were very conservative, very gentlemanly, you still are, but as their rhetoric gets more draconian, more fascistic, more fascist slash communist, you are upping the threat continuum, basically up to their level, and that's a very good thing.
[01:42:11.822 --> 01:42:14.304]  That is the answer, to be bold in their face.
[01:42:14.664 --> 01:42:16.726]  Thank you so much, and have a great Christmas coming up.
[01:42:16.766 --> 01:42:17.547]  Say hi to your wife for me.
[01:42:18.717 --> 01:42:19.277]  Certainly will.
[01:42:19.357 --> 01:42:20.117]  God bless you all.
[01:42:20.197 --> 01:42:21.077]  God bless America.
[01:42:21.197 --> 01:42:22.358]  And we will win.
[01:42:23.218 --> 01:42:23.718]  We have to.
[01:42:23.778 --> 01:42:25.158]  And we are starting to turn the tide, folks.
[01:42:25.178 --> 01:42:26.438]  That's not me up here cheerleading.
[01:42:27.459 --> 01:42:30.699]  Briefly, funding this operation is one of the biggest ways to win.
[01:42:31.019 --> 01:42:41.921]  And when you buy the high quality products, the super high quality nutraceuticals, the supplements, when you buy a Hillary for Prison shirt that they're all starting to sell out right now.
[01:42:41.981 --> 01:42:43.062]  It's a limited edition shirt.
[01:42:43.082 --> 01:42:44.922]  We won't sell them anymore after December.
[01:42:45.402 --> 01:42:55.011]  When you buy the books, the videos, the solar power systems for your houses, all the best vetted quality products we can find at the lowest prices that we can offer.
[01:42:55.472 --> 01:42:57.073]  And many times we are the lowest out there.
[01:42:57.594 --> 01:43:04.300]  InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com free shipping ends tomorrow.
[01:43:05.301 --> 01:43:09.806]  Because we can't get it to you before Christmas if you don't have your orders in by noon tomorrow.
[01:43:10.981 --> 01:43:14.243]  But if you order today or tomorrow, we'll be able to get it to you in the U.S.
[01:43:14.704 --> 01:43:15.744]  before Christmas.

[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:39.401]  InfoWarsStore.com and
[01:43:40.874 --> 01:43:48.676]  You are the ones financing this to get reporters, investigative journalists, to get on more affiliates, TV, to put up the satellites, and it's all working.
[01:43:49.696 --> 01:43:53.597]  By the grace of God, everything we've ever tried has been successful.
[01:43:54.418 --> 01:43:57.758]  Some things more successful than others, so we then focus on what's more successful.
[01:43:59.239 --> 01:44:03.380]  But I'll tell you, what we're able to do in the media now is scary.
[01:44:04.468 --> 01:44:10.529]  Thanks to working with all the other great liberty lovers around the world like Matt Drudge and WorldNetDaily and so many others, I don't want to fight with Breitbart.
[01:44:10.729 --> 01:44:12.110]  I don't want to fight with Glenn Beck.
[01:44:12.630 --> 01:44:13.970]  Man, I want to defeat the globalists.
[01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:16.891]  That's why people come to Infowars and they go, you promote everybody.
[01:44:18.031 --> 01:44:20.232]  A lot of folks, you know, don't promote Alex Jones.
[01:44:20.292 --> 01:44:22.252]  Look, I know I'm aggressive.
[01:44:22.892 --> 01:44:24.173]  I know I come off mean.
[01:44:24.293 --> 01:44:25.733]  It's because I'm under attack.
[01:44:25.853 --> 01:44:26.393]  I know that.
[01:44:27.613 --> 01:44:29.834]  And we're not going to win mincing words or milquetoast.
[01:44:29.854 --> 01:44:30.214]  That's why
[01:44:31.417 --> 01:44:34.999]  You notice that all the other big sites and the other big hosts now sound more like me.
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:36.000]  I don't sound like them.
[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:37.261]  I didn't moderate.
[01:44:37.501 --> 01:44:38.382]  They came over.
[01:44:39.563 --> 01:44:40.443]  And so I'm not bragging.
[01:44:41.164 --> 01:44:42.425]  Leon Mackett is about to be with us.
[01:44:42.925 --> 01:44:44.046]  I'm not bragging here.
[01:44:44.066 --> 01:44:45.767]  I want you to understand something.
[01:44:46.407 --> 01:44:54.633]  The truest success is getting others to change and to see your view and to wake up and not parrot what you say, but see what you're seeing.
[01:44:54.973 --> 01:44:55.574]  Click with it.
[01:44:55.694 --> 01:44:55.994]  Get it.
[01:44:57.370 --> 01:44:59.031]  And it's not the 20 million people we reach a week.
[01:44:59.091 --> 01:45:00.512]  Conservatively, that's the big victory.
[01:45:00.752 --> 01:45:01.352]  It's scary.
[01:45:02.533 --> 01:45:07.196]  How many people now in prominent positions listen and are now waking up others?
[01:45:07.556 --> 01:45:09.337]  I'm telling you folks, we're having a huge victory.
[01:45:09.377 --> 01:45:15.000]  Now, Leanne McAdoo, five minutes to the next hour, is going to join us, and we've got our theme song.
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:23.505]  For radio listeners, go to Infowars.com forward slash show, and you can actually see the graphics, see the articles, and, well, see Leanne McAdoo.
[01:45:23.765 --> 01:45:25.306]  Bring her in here into the studio, please.
[01:45:27.228 --> 01:45:28.109]  Oh my gosh!
[01:45:29.170 --> 01:45:33.274]  Christmas tree and a nice, smart brunette in a green dress.
[01:45:34.095 --> 01:45:35.656]  You can't beat that.
[01:45:35.676 --> 01:45:39.100]  McAdoo's not just Scottish, he's also Irish.
[01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:42.023]  And don't Scottish girls look healthy and happy and green?
[01:45:44.336 --> 01:45:46.397]  Alright, here she is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:45:46.457 --> 01:45:50.419]  As Irish as a bottle of Jameson's Whiskey, Leanne McAdoo.
[01:45:50.519 --> 01:45:52.560]  Yay!
[01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:56.122]  Hey, I love the great work you've done, Jakari, the whole crew.
[01:45:56.142 --> 01:45:57.422]  I get excited about Lord Monckton.
[01:45:57.703 --> 01:46:02.725]  I get excited about the guest we had on yesterday from the Veritas Project, James O'Keefe.
[01:46:02.945 --> 01:46:04.486]  I get excited about what Matt Drudge is doing.
[01:46:04.506 --> 01:46:05.906]  I get excited about what Paul Watson's doing.
[01:46:06.127 --> 01:46:09.408]  I get excited when Biggs is out there breaking big stories and on Salazar.
[01:46:09.748 --> 01:46:10.949]  All of our reporters, everybody.
[01:46:11.229 --> 01:46:17.872]  You know, when Rob Jacobson cuts a great commercial, or Darren McBreen makes some amazing graphics, it's just fun to fight, Leigh-Ann.
[01:46:17.892 --> 01:46:26.256]  I know we've got all this news to get into, but I've been pretty wound up lately, and it's because you were here three and a half years ago, I was a little bit bummed out, but I mean, I think we're winning, Leigh-Ann.
[01:46:26.596 --> 01:46:26.997]  I do too.
[01:46:27.077 --> 01:46:33.363]  It amazes me how every single time the mainstream media will try and attack, we just get bigger.
[01:46:33.923 --> 01:46:35.925]  And it's incredible just the support we have.
[01:46:35.945 --> 01:46:37.667]  They're kind of coming out of the woodwork now.
[01:46:37.747 --> 01:46:43.773]  Even Kurt Russell, you'll see people in Hollywood, when they start to put that hammer down, people are going to start speaking up.
[01:46:44.634 --> 01:46:50.478]  Exactly, and what are they going to do when almost every big star you can imagine is a listener of the show and a patriot?
[01:46:50.678 --> 01:46:52.560]  And I don't brag about the show, again, it's a litmus test.
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:57.323]  But most of them, and you've been behind the scenes, you know about a lot of this, won't come on, though, but they say, hey, I'm a listener.
[01:46:57.723 --> 01:46:58.144]  Exactly.
[01:46:58.204 --> 01:47:01.586]  I mean, when they all start going public, it is going to jack the globalists up.
[01:47:01.686 --> 01:47:06.129]  Right, because they think that they're not going to be, you know, in their next film or something like that.
[01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:07.710]  They'll be blackballed from the industry.
[01:47:07.730 --> 01:47:08.911]  How are they going to blackball all of them?
[01:47:09.251 --> 01:47:09.712]  Exactly.
[01:47:10.152 --> 01:47:12.654]  And that's what we need, is we need people to start speaking up
[01:47:13.576 --> 01:47:20.978]  I mean, today was one of those days I woke up and I wanted to get inside of my invisible jet and fly away forever because it was just so frustrating.
[01:47:21.478 --> 01:47:25.639]  The news that is going on today with Congress... You didn't want to just tie somebody up in a golden rope?
[01:47:25.759 --> 01:47:35.242]  I want to tie Congress up with the golden lasso and force them to speak the truth because here, as well as the media, as well as the president coming out today and
[01:47:36.559 --> 01:47:38.420]  Saying, oh, there's nothing to be worried about.
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:39.681]  There's no credible terror threat.
[01:47:39.741 --> 01:47:42.603]  Meanwhile, all you're seeing on television is terror, terror, terror.
[01:47:42.683 --> 01:47:51.888]  It's just, it's mass confusion on purpose to paralyze the public so that they can't do anything about Congress's- It's like a Wonder Woman rubs around them.
[01:47:52.488 --> 01:47:52.969]  To itself.
[01:47:52.989 --> 01:47:54.430]  Like a bad Wonder Woman tied them up.
[01:47:54.450 --> 01:47:55.290]  They just have to submit.
[01:47:55.670 --> 01:47:55.950]  Yeah.
[01:47:57.471 --> 01:47:57.932]  Bad people.
[01:47:59.255 --> 01:48:01.517]  Leanne, there is so much news to get to here.
[01:48:02.478 --> 01:48:04.980]  Let's cover this Martin... Screlly.
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:05.640]  Screlly.
[01:48:06.621 --> 01:48:07.582]  I still can't get his name right.
[01:48:07.602 --> 01:48:08.762]  I don't think it's the word Screlly.
[01:48:08.823 --> 01:48:10.644]  It just sounds like a little weaselly guy.
[01:48:10.664 --> 01:48:12.665]  Screlly.
[01:48:13.366 --> 01:48:14.987]  5,000% increase in these pills.
[01:48:15.207 --> 01:48:16.008]  Right.
[01:48:16.128 --> 01:48:17.169]  And he's proud of himself.
[01:48:17.289 --> 01:48:18.150]  And now he's in trouble.
[01:48:19.031 --> 01:48:24.656]  Right, and not only that, but he is the sole owner of the only copy of the latest Wu-Tang album.
[01:48:24.876 --> 01:48:34.324]  So he not only buys the patents for all these prescription drugs so that he can then raise the prices 5,000 percent, he goes and buys the only Wu-Tang album for two million dollars.
[01:48:34.484 --> 01:48:37.126]  And of course he's now been arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[01:48:37.406 --> 01:48:39.927]  Yeah, well, and so he's, it's a little bit of karma.
[01:48:39.967 --> 01:48:42.268]  So he's been arrested for securities fraud.
[01:48:42.288 --> 01:48:45.989]  The FBI, you see him there in handcuffs today.
[01:48:46.009 --> 01:48:55.613]  I guess he was illegally selling off some of his stocks from one company to pay off the debt and, you know, the thugs that were probably... So he was rat-holing stock?
[01:48:55.993 --> 01:48:56.794]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:48:56.834 --> 01:48:57.875]  So he's just a good guy.
[01:48:58.295 --> 01:49:09.726]  But, you know, you see him there in his hoodie, his gray hoodie, so this probably, he feels like it gives him a little more street cred because he's, uh, apparently he wants to be, like, in with the rappers and stuff, so.
[01:49:10.787 --> 01:49:11.307]  He's a good guy.
[01:49:11.647 --> 01:49:12.468]  Very good guy.
[01:49:12.909 --> 01:49:16.272]  So I guess this is a little Christmas karma for Martin Shkreli.
[01:49:16.732 --> 01:49:19.315]  Now if we could just get some Christmas karma for Congress!
[01:49:20.908 --> 01:49:22.749]  He does look like the consummate weasel.
[01:49:22.809 --> 01:49:24.590]  I think he's got a job in Hollywood as a weasel.
[01:49:24.610 --> 01:49:26.671]  Look at that little simpering look on his face.
[01:49:26.751 --> 01:49:27.872]  I mean, my goodness.
[01:49:27.912 --> 01:49:29.232]  Well, he's kind of like Madoff.
[01:49:29.292 --> 01:49:32.974]  He was a mid-level con artist, not in the actual elite.
[01:49:32.994 --> 01:49:33.835]  That's why they burned him.
[01:49:34.707 --> 01:49:35.628]  Yeah, well that's the thing.
[01:49:35.668 --> 01:49:39.070]  It's like, how many times does stuff like that happen and you look the other way?
[01:49:39.210 --> 01:49:40.671]  Or, you know, perhaps they get tossed off.
[01:49:40.691 --> 01:49:45.375]  Well, if he was a Nazi war criminal and funded anti-gun initiatives, he'd get an ADL award.
[01:49:45.695 --> 01:49:45.875]  Right.
[01:49:46.355 --> 01:49:58.384]  So for whatever reason, this guy, he's going to be the one that gets thrown under the bus because it's not like he's the only person who's raised the prices on drugs that are, you know... He just did it the most.
[01:49:58.704 --> 01:49:58.984]  Yeah.
[01:49:59.124 --> 01:50:00.605]  Well, Americans do pay the most for drugs.
[01:50:00.665 --> 01:50:01.506]  He just did it overnight.
[01:50:02.256 --> 01:50:02.716]  It is wrong.
[01:50:03.376 --> 01:50:12.378]  Leanne, shifting gears to another subject, what do you think of Vladimir Putin coming out and saying he likes Donald Trump, that he's a talented man that wants to work with Russia, and that how can Russia be against that?
[01:50:12.398 --> 01:50:13.378]  They have to welcome that stance.
[01:50:14.198 --> 01:50:20.559]  Well, I mean, Carly Fiorina said that Trump respects, I mean, that Putin respects, you know, someone that's strong.
[01:50:20.879 --> 01:50:21.920]  He respects strength.
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:26.180]  So I guess he just likes the fact that Trump's coming out and speaking his mind.
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:28.821]  Well, Trump doesn't want to start World War III for no reason.
[01:50:29.321 --> 01:50:29.501]  Right.
[01:50:31.010 --> 01:50:32.712]  Yeah, which is insane.
[01:50:33.032 --> 01:50:33.452]  Insane.
[01:50:33.532 --> 01:50:38.697]  Why would you want to shoot down a Russian plane that has been invited into that airspace?
[01:50:38.717 --> 01:50:39.738]  And that's bombing ISIS.
[01:50:40.038 --> 01:50:42.641]  Somebody said Chris Christie needs a no-fry zone.
[01:50:43.789 --> 01:50:46.290]  Well, yeah, well he needs it around his refrigerator at night.
[01:50:46.831 --> 01:50:48.511]  No, I gotta hand it to him, he's lost a lot of weight.
[01:50:48.672 --> 01:50:50.833]  I mean, you know, I've lost a lot of weight too, but I was never that big.
[01:50:50.873 --> 01:50:51.933]  I'm not against fat people, hell.
[01:50:52.373 --> 01:50:57.536]  I mean, I'm just being clear here that Chris Christie wants to eat the Constitution and I'm not gonna let him.
[01:50:57.576 --> 01:50:59.617]  We'll be right back on the other side with Leanne McAdoo.
[01:50:59.637 --> 01:51:00.578]  You got a bunch of other stuff.
[01:51:00.598 --> 01:51:01.418]  What's up next, Leanne?
[01:51:01.518 --> 01:51:05.100]  We're gonna talk about Congress's half trillion dollar spending binge.
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:08.462]  That's right, Paul Ryan had some presents for the Democrats under the tree.
[01:51:09.730 --> 01:51:13.693]  With a new year coming, it's time for a new way to look at weapon storage.
[01:51:13.993 --> 01:51:17.095]  Safes can't be accessed quickly and racks are unsafe for children.
[01:51:17.235 --> 01:51:19.737]  Covert Cabinets are the next level in home defense.
[01:51:19.797 --> 01:51:25.201]  They fit seamlessly into any home's decor and they provide quick access to firearms while keeping them uniquely hidden.
[01:51:25.261 --> 01:51:27.843]  Covert Cabinets, the ideal hidden storage solution.
[01:51:27.883 --> 01:51:29.264]  Custom made in the USA.
[01:51:29.364 --> 01:51:34.808]  Covert Cabinets are an elegant and practical alternative to the bulky and obvious storage systems of the past.

[01:52:34.383 --> 01:52:36.604]  My name is Jonathan Wright, and I'm 40 years old.
[01:52:36.704 --> 01:52:39.485]  I recently went from a desk job to a manual labor job.
[01:52:39.546 --> 01:52:40.546]  Normally, I'm worn out.

[01:53:17.749 --> 01:53:19.950]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?

[01:54:32.119 --> 01:54:39.225]  But liberty for their descendants.

[01:54:44.250 --> 01:54:44.850]  Free today.
[01:54:46.051 --> 01:54:49.274]  Star Wars spoilers should be a crime since Philadelphia Police Department.
[01:54:49.294 --> 01:54:52.737]  That means after you go pay to see it, you shouldn't be able to.
[01:54:54.281 --> 01:54:55.462]  I mean, we don't even have a culture now.
[01:54:55.502 --> 01:54:56.482]  Our culture is Star Wars.
[01:54:56.522 --> 01:54:57.983]  I'm not against Star Wars.
[01:54:58.043 --> 01:54:59.944]  It's just not a real culture.
[01:55:00.104 --> 01:55:02.905]  They say not even to talk about it on your way out of the movie theater.
[01:55:03.565 --> 01:55:08.928]  Well, just because they're talking like that, we're going to send our reporters there and we're going to talk about it.
[01:55:09.908 --> 01:55:13.070]  And I've already got what the plot is and I'm going to talk about it.
[01:55:13.809 --> 01:55:15.931]  Oh my gosh, I need to make Hollywood and Fox.
[01:55:16.452 --> 01:55:18.294]  Billions more.
[01:55:18.674 --> 01:55:20.556]  I'm not going to see the film so far.
[01:55:20.576 --> 01:55:23.539]  Again, it's an attack on free speech.
[01:55:23.579 --> 01:55:25.100]  It's all part of this training us.
[01:55:25.141 --> 01:55:26.242]  We don't have speech, and I'm tired of it.
[01:55:26.562 --> 01:55:32.208]  Somebody that goes and sees a movie has every right to talk about it and write reviews about it under the First Amendment, Leigh Ann.
[01:55:32.947 --> 01:55:50.525]  Well, I agree, and this whole thing with Star Wars, yeah, I know it's so very exciting, but look at this huge spending bill that is being shoved down our throats at the final hour when Congress is about to go on their Christmas break, and all anyone can think about is Star Wars and fake terror threats.
[01:55:50.705 --> 01:55:51.806]  And Caitlyn Jenner.
[01:55:52.186 --> 01:55:52.667]  And Caitlyn.
[01:55:52.687 --> 01:55:53.408]  Stunning and brave.
[01:55:54.748 --> 01:56:00.190]  Congress' half trillion dollar spending binge, one of the biggest ever, is a massive increase in the budget.
[01:56:01.050 --> 01:56:03.351]  Nearly $700 billion in unpaid tax cuts.
[01:56:03.891 --> 01:56:12.774]  That's political reporting and they admit it's the biggest junket ever, the biggest boondoggles ever, the biggest pork barrel ever, mainly for Democrats.
[01:56:12.794 --> 01:56:19.736]  So Paul Ryan is delivering them succulent goodies and they voted more of them than Democrats
[01:56:20.802 --> 01:56:26.424]  More people voted than Republicans voted for it, showing we have Democratic operatives running the Republican Party.
[01:56:26.964 --> 01:56:27.184]  Right.
[01:56:27.444 --> 01:56:28.144]  Absolutely.
[01:56:28.604 --> 01:56:34.186]  And David Knight was right to call him Paul Ryan-o, because he came in there, he's going to do more of the same.
[01:56:34.206 --> 01:56:41.328]  Of course he's going to get a pass on this, because everyone's just going to say, oh, well, he just was, you know... Well, he's skinny and looks like the boy next door.
[01:56:41.588 --> 01:56:42.869]  No, he looks like a serial killer.
[01:56:43.629 --> 01:56:45.470]  Most serial killers look like the guy next door.
[01:56:45.630 --> 01:56:45.910]  I agree.
[01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:52.795]  And so, you know, we want to point out that none of this is going to be paid for by budget cuts or other tax offsets.
[01:56:53.476 --> 01:56:55.457]  It's all going to be added to the national debt.
[01:56:55.517 --> 01:56:57.219]  They have no plan to pay for this.
[01:56:57.479 --> 01:56:58.740]  I would not do business with Paul Ryan.
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:03.344]  I mean, I'm just a guy that looks like that with those eyes as a predator and thinks I'm stupid and thinks he's tougher than me.
[01:57:03.364 --> 01:57:03.784]  And you're not.
[01:57:03.824 --> 01:57:04.284]  You're a bunk.
[01:57:04.444 --> 01:57:05.345]  You're a scumbag filth.
[01:57:05.385 --> 01:57:05.745]  I'm sorry.
[01:57:06.046 --> 01:57:06.446]  Sorry, Leigh Ann.
[01:57:06.466 --> 01:57:06.706]  Go ahead.
[01:57:07.707 --> 01:57:08.628]  I'm just getting really angry at him.
[01:57:09.082 --> 01:57:14.984]  And so, by the way, now this is supposedly going to help out both sides of the aisle there.
[01:57:15.024 --> 01:57:17.325]  You know, Christmas presents for everybody.
[01:57:17.625 --> 01:57:22.327]  So the tax break package, it's going to cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years.
[01:57:22.407 --> 01:57:27.229]  It includes presents for NASCAR, horse racing, and a whole slew of other
[01:57:27.469 --> 01:57:29.130]  Yeah, because NASCAR needs more money.
[01:57:29.150 --> 01:57:31.272]  It isn't one of the most profitable ventures in America.
[01:57:31.692 --> 01:57:31.852]  Right.
[01:57:32.212 --> 01:57:32.572]  That's what I mean.
[01:57:32.612 --> 01:57:39.217]  I'm sick of all these insider corporations who line up almost to a corporation, anti-gun, pro-open border, anti-family.
[01:57:39.477 --> 01:57:42.479]  Well, of course, they want to run the government because they're all getting my tax money.
[01:57:42.699 --> 01:57:48.583]  But then as a small business owner that actually employs people in America and manufactures things, I'm being screwed over.
[01:57:48.863 --> 01:57:49.083]  Right.
[01:57:49.864 --> 01:57:54.507]  And Rand Paul said, you know, it's not charity when it's other people's money.
[01:57:54.987 --> 01:57:57.029]  So they're just giving away all of our money and then just
[01:57:57.749 --> 01:57:58.809]  Filling us with terror.
[01:57:58.849 --> 01:58:01.850]  I mean, I was in there looking at CNN for the entire hour.
[01:58:01.930 --> 01:58:04.391]  It's just all about all these terror things all over the country.
[01:58:04.411 --> 01:58:12.453]  Not a single thing on this very important... Europe is now saying they're going to have standing armies patrolling, banning free speech, but letting more radical Muslims in.
[01:58:12.693 --> 01:58:20.535]  They used it to have a standing army take over just like Palpatine took over the Empire by staging terror attacks.
[01:58:21.155 --> 01:58:23.296]  They're literally taking over via a Star Wars plot.
[01:58:23.536 --> 01:58:29.979]  Right, and it's just ridiculous and it is all meant to instill us with fear so that we're paralyzed and we can't do anything about it.
[01:58:30.039 --> 01:58:30.419]  That's right.
[01:58:30.639 --> 01:58:34.981]  By the way, when that movie came out seven, eight years ago, Revenge of the Sith or whatever, I did reviews of it.
[01:58:35.001 --> 01:58:40.004]  We ought to find those and play those in the Nightly News tonight where I break down how it's really what happened with the WMDs, the fake war.
[01:58:40.544 --> 01:58:42.726]  Now it's in foreign affairs.
[01:58:42.826 --> 01:58:46.129]  It's now all over the news saying exactly what we said years ago.
[01:58:46.469 --> 01:58:49.472]  Again, we were first, as usual, on target.
[01:58:49.672 --> 01:58:50.493]  Proven right again.
[01:58:50.813 --> 01:58:53.896]  Leanne McAdoo coming up with me some in the third hour.
[01:58:54.697 --> 01:58:56.819]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:02.642]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:59:02.942 --> 01:59:10.946]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:59:11.186 --> 01:59:16.209]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:59:16.609 --> 01:59:18.890]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:59:19.130 --> 01:59:20.911]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:59:29.341 --> 01:59:30.261]  BrainForce is here.
[01:59:30.441 --> 01:59:32.542]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:59:32.662 --> 01:59:37.404]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:59:37.644 --> 01:59:39.304]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[01:59:39.344 --> 01:59:40.805]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:59:40.945 --> 01:59:44.146]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:59:44.426 --> 01:59:46.227]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:59:46.407 --> 01:59:47.307]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:59:47.327 --> 01:59:48.267]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:59:48.507 --> 01:59:50.408]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:59:50.508 --> 01:59:56.110]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:00:02.044 --> 02:00:04.658]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:22.347 --> 02:00:29.833]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:00:30.614 --> 02:00:31.655]  Love this song, says it all.
[02:00:31.675 --> 02:00:34.497]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:34.617 --> 02:00:35.558]  I mean, you are the resistance.
[02:00:35.598 --> 02:00:38.521]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:00:38.541 --> 02:00:39.041]  In the heart.
[02:00:39.381 --> 02:00:40.943]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:41.483 --> 02:00:46.968]  Take the children and yourself and hide out in the cellar.
[02:00:47.108 --> 02:00:47.648]  The fighting.
[02:00:48.129 --> 02:00:50.591]  By now the fighting will be over.
[02:00:52.688 --> 02:01:05.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, the only reason I've been so successful is because I've had a historical context, I've studied, and I've been aggressive, and I've known that all that evil men and tyrants seem to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[02:01:09.823 --> 02:01:13.687]  And because I have been a maniac since I was born, a good maniac,
[02:01:14.833 --> 02:01:17.134]  I've been somewhat immune to being put into a trance.
[02:01:17.594 --> 02:01:24.076]  So I'm just awake watching the total takeover, and I'm just jumping up and down like a chicken with my head cut off saying, we gotta do something.
[02:01:24.116 --> 02:01:28.298]  And the reason I get into my personal experience is, it's a blueprint for success.
[02:01:30.639 --> 02:01:35.780]  Stop worrying about getting it all perfectly right, or don't thinking you're a leader, or oh, I'm gonna do it next year or next month.
[02:01:36.301 --> 02:01:39.862]  Get involved now, pick an issue, get involved, get aggressive.
[02:01:41.348 --> 02:01:42.268]  Vote with your dollars.
[02:01:42.908 --> 02:01:47.130]  Leanne, we've got a clip here from Senator Sessions trying to stop this spending bill.
[02:01:47.610 --> 02:01:48.970]  One of the biggest, the biggest ever.
[02:01:49.030 --> 02:01:49.611]  Pork barrel.
[02:01:49.831 --> 02:01:50.571]  They've broken it down.
[02:01:50.731 --> 02:01:51.951]  Massive for the Democrats.
[02:01:52.371 --> 02:01:54.632]  Huge little gifts under the tree for them.
[02:01:55.532 --> 02:01:59.914]  I guess gun owners and patriots, we get Crumpus visits us to haul us off on a slave ship.
[02:02:00.914 --> 02:02:03.915]  But let's go ahead and go to Senator Sessions.
[02:02:05.652 --> 02:02:14.357]  For years, the American people have suffered under the lawless, dangerous, wage-reducing immigration policies of this administration.
[02:02:14.997 --> 02:02:16.238]  They sent us to Washington.
[02:02:16.478 --> 02:02:22.561]  They sent us here, the people did, to protect their interest, to protect the people's interest.
[02:02:23.666 --> 02:02:30.813]  To ensure the defense of their families and to advance the common good, the public interest.
[02:02:31.213 --> 02:02:41.103]  They did not send us here to bow down to the President's lawless immigration policies, nor to line the pockets of special interest in big business.
[02:02:41.784 --> 02:02:43.205]  That's not what we are here for.
[02:02:43.805 --> 02:02:45.087]  Who do we represent?
[02:02:46.435 --> 02:03:09.673]  This ominous bill approves the President's request for increased refugee admissions, allowing him to bring in as many refugees as he wants, and he can bring them from anywhere he wants, and allow them access to unlimited welfare and entitlements at the taxpayer expense, which is not scored as a cost under this bill.
[02:03:09.693 --> 02:03:10.734]  $700 million not paid for.
[02:03:11.414 --> 02:03:15.417]  It will ensure at least 170,000 green cards.
[02:03:15.437 --> 02:03:19.340]  That means permanent residency with a guaranteed path to citizenship.
[02:03:20.521 --> 02:03:29.448]  Refugee and asylee approvals will be issued to migrants from Muslim countries just over the next 12 months.
[02:03:29.468 --> 02:03:30.089]  That's right, Leanne.
[02:03:30.689 --> 02:03:34.032]  It contains dramatic changes to federal immigration laws.
[02:03:34.092 --> 02:03:36.534]  In fact, I mentioned this earlier in the show, but I should have made a bigger deal.
[02:03:36.554 --> 02:03:37.334]  It's not even the money.
[02:03:37.635 --> 02:03:40.237]  It's that it's basically an open border blank check to Oboza.
[02:03:40.748 --> 02:03:42.709]  And there are two bills people need to understand.
[02:03:42.729 --> 02:03:51.552]  So the Republicans basically sold us out to get their little nearly $700 billion tax package, which is just giving these extenders temporary tax breaks.
[02:03:52.012 --> 02:03:57.914]  But the other one that's supposed to be voted on tomorrow is a massive $1.1 trillion spending bill.
[02:03:58.094 --> 02:04:00.375]  It's pretty much Obama's agenda.
[02:04:00.755 --> 02:04:02.616]  It's the Omnibus funding bill.
[02:04:03.456 --> 02:04:10.258]  Okay, and the President actually gloated over this agreement, saying that he got nearly everything he wanted and gave up very little.
[02:04:10.398 --> 02:04:11.679]  Oh, good job, Paul Ryan.
[02:04:12.039 --> 02:04:20.741]  So, now, this omnibus funding bill, it increases foreign worker visas, okay, so it will more than triple the number of H-2B visas.
[02:04:21.161 --> 02:04:24.903]  These are not just, you know, people coming to work jobs Americans don't want.
[02:04:25.243 --> 02:04:32.325]  These are brought in exclusively to fill blue-collar, non-farm jobs in hotels, restaurants, construction, truck driving,
[02:04:32.885 --> 02:04:34.426]  And many other occupations.
[02:04:34.466 --> 02:04:38.610]  And I'm not against foreigners, but it's like the Star Wars space bar.
[02:04:39.170 --> 02:04:43.173]  Everywhere I go, when I call customer service, I can't understand a word they're saying.
[02:04:43.534 --> 02:04:43.694]  Right.
[02:04:44.054 --> 02:04:44.714]  And that's not all.
[02:04:45.415 --> 02:04:46.596]  His climate deal is in it.
[02:04:46.636 --> 02:04:48.077]  Planned Parenthood is funded.
[02:04:48.137 --> 02:04:50.459]  I mean, it is a lose-lose for the American people.
[02:04:50.919 --> 02:04:52.140]  We got sold out once again.
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:53.722]  I mean, they're probably going to pass it.
[02:04:53.742 --> 02:04:54.922]  They're voting on it today, tomorrow.
[02:04:55.703 --> 02:04:57.384]  That's right, stay there.
[02:04:57.404 --> 02:05:04.367]  Let's come back and recap that because the whole immigration thing, you know, Al-Qaeda pipeline, ISIS pipeline is huge.
[02:05:04.387 --> 02:05:07.368]  And then I want to get into some of the Second Amendment news.
[02:05:07.488 --> 02:05:08.369]  They're coming for the guns.
[02:05:09.525 --> 02:05:16.127]  A mistrial has been declared in the case of Baltimore police officer William Porter in the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray.
[02:05:16.347 --> 02:05:21.068]  The jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision on the four charges the officer faces.
[02:05:21.508 --> 02:05:26.309]  Porter is the first of six city police officers to stand trial in the death of Freddie Gray.
[02:05:26.730 --> 02:05:34.031]  Gray suffered a broken neck and severe spinal cord injury while being transported in the back of a police van after his arrest on April 12th.
[02:05:34.312 --> 02:05:35.812]  He died in police custody.
[02:05:36.212 --> 02:05:41.154]  Baltimore City's Emergency Operations Center has been activated in preparation for protests.
[02:05:41.635 --> 02:05:45.416]  Police from around the Baltimore region began assembling Tuesday with riot gear.
[02:05:45.737 --> 02:05:53.080]  Jail space has been cleared in case of mass arrests, and political and community leaders are issuing calls for calm and peaceful protests.
[02:05:53.420 --> 02:05:58.242]  But some Black Lives Matter supporters are already threatening to stage riots in Baltimore.
[02:05:58.522 --> 02:06:03.625]  And some fear there could be a repeat of the massive rioting that took place in the city at the end of April.
[02:06:04.025 --> 02:06:07.206]  This is a developing story so stay tuned to InfoWars.com
[02:06:09.315 --> 02:06:12.537]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[02:07:38.692 --> 02:07:39.092]  I think so.
[02:08:13.453 --> 02:08:14.594]  It's never going to get any better.
[02:08:14.994 --> 02:08:15.715]  Don't look for it.
[02:08:16.135 --> 02:08:17.276]  Be happy with what you got.
[02:08:18.417 --> 02:08:21.480]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[02:08:22.020 --> 02:08:23.682]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[02:08:24.082 --> 02:08:25.123]  The real owners.
[02:08:25.203 --> 02:08:29.727]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[02:08:30.107 --> 02:08:31.328]  Forget the politicians.
[02:08:31.548 --> 02:08:34.831]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[02:08:36.392 --> 02:08:36.853]  You don't.
[02:08:37.633 --> 02:08:38.614]  You have no choice.
[02:08:38.995 --> 02:08:39.915]  You have owners.
[02:08:40.236 --> 02:08:41.136]  They own you.
[02:08:42.472 --> 02:08:43.773]  They own everything.
[02:08:43.793 --> 02:08:45.654]  They own all the important land.
[02:08:46.014 --> 02:08:47.755]  They own and control the corporations.
[02:08:47.775 --> 02:08:51.257]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls.
[02:08:51.277 --> 02:08:52.858]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[02:08:53.198 --> 02:08:58.001]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[02:08:58.181 --> 02:08:59.802]  They got you by the balls!
[02:09:01.301 --> 02:09:03.402]  They want obedient workers.
[02:09:03.842 --> 02:09:05.342]  Obedient workers.
[02:09:05.662 --> 02:09:18.366]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[02:09:18.446 --> 02:09:21.687]  And now they're coming for your social security money.
[02:09:22.147 --> 02:09:24.788]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[02:09:26.229 --> 02:09:27.109]  It's a big club.
[02:09:28.126 --> 02:09:28.806]  And you ain't in it.
[02:09:29.166 --> 02:09:34.487]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[02:09:34.828 --> 02:09:35.708]  You better believe it.
[02:09:35.808 --> 02:09:37.688]  So what specifically did they do?
[02:09:38.128 --> 02:09:43.269]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage, I've given to, just so you understand.
[02:09:43.289 --> 02:09:44.130]  A lot of money.
[02:09:44.750 --> 02:09:47.450]  You and I are not in the big club.
[02:09:47.811 --> 02:09:49.751]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[02:09:50.371 --> 02:09:54.092]  It's called the American dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[02:09:55.509 --> 02:09:56.990]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[02:09:57.371 --> 02:10:00.854]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[02:10:00.894 --> 02:10:04.798]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[02:10:04.818 --> 02:10:05.779]  They're not interested in that.
[02:10:06.059 --> 02:10:07.000]  That doesn't help them.
[02:10:07.380 --> 02:10:08.741]  That's against their interest.
[02:10:09.262 --> 02:10:09.682]  That's right.
[02:10:09.943 --> 02:10:14.907]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:19.703]  Right up here on the front line is Leanne McAdoo.
[02:10:20.424 --> 02:10:22.605]  In studio with us to cover a bunch of news.
[02:10:23.346 --> 02:10:26.649]  And then coming up, don't we have Richard Reeves from the campaign trail?
[02:10:28.016 --> 02:10:31.379]  1.30 he'll be joining us there in Iowa.
[02:10:31.899 --> 02:10:35.462]  So we've got reporters on the ground, Las Vegas at the debate, Iowa.
[02:10:35.962 --> 02:10:40.165]  I mean, we're not playing around here at Infowars.com and the entire operation.
[02:10:40.185 --> 02:10:43.507]  We salute all our affiliates, all of our listeners, all of our sponsors.
[02:10:43.948 --> 02:10:45.629]  Very important to support our local stations.
[02:10:45.649 --> 02:10:47.610]  Very important to buy their products.
[02:10:47.650 --> 02:10:49.992]  Very important to sign up for their email list.
[02:10:50.292 --> 02:10:53.695]  Very important to tell friends and family and neighbors to tune in aggressively.
[02:10:54.215 --> 02:10:55.356]  We're in an info war.
[02:10:55.716 --> 02:11:09.267]  Whenever Obama's trying to rally his masses of idiot followers and dumbed-down victims, he's trying to just savage the poor blacks of this country to make them total slaves again, doubling their unemployment with viciousness, because he knows he's got them.
[02:11:09.447 --> 02:11:10.047]  He doesn't need them.
[02:11:10.568 --> 02:11:11.368]  I mean, this is sick.
[02:11:11.849 --> 02:11:12.729]  He tries to rally.
[02:11:12.769 --> 02:11:13.990]  We need your help to get the guns.
[02:11:14.030 --> 02:11:15.211]  We need your help to get them banned.
[02:11:15.491 --> 02:11:16.232]  Get involved.
[02:11:16.312 --> 02:11:16.973]  Give money.
[02:11:17.253 --> 02:11:17.713]  Go out.
[02:11:17.813 --> 02:11:18.253]  Lobby.
[02:11:18.494 --> 02:11:18.854]  Vote.
[02:11:19.254 --> 02:11:22.357]  I need your power to destroy and enslave the bitter clingers!
[02:11:23.377 --> 02:11:23.878]  I'm saying,
[02:11:25.529 --> 02:11:30.731]  Spread the word, get aggressive, fire these people in the war.
[02:11:31.711 --> 02:11:32.891]  Spray them with truth.
[02:11:34.412 --> 02:11:41.274]  That's what you do when you tell people on Facebook and Twitter about the show, when you promote our videos, when you send them to people.
[02:11:42.330 --> 02:11:47.754]  I mean, quite frankly, there's a type of mania that comes into this in a good way when you're in a fight for your life.
[02:11:48.515 --> 02:11:56.982]  Because you know you're committed, you're not on the sidelines, you're not aimless, you don't know what's going on when you're in a coma.
[02:11:57.202 --> 02:11:59.264]  When you do know what's going on, it's so...
[02:12:00.751 --> 02:12:01.312]  Dynamic.
[02:12:01.372 --> 02:12:02.533]  It's so exciting.
[02:12:02.593 --> 02:12:06.015]  And once people get into the fight for liberty, they go, why did I do this before?
[02:12:06.095 --> 02:12:07.296]  This is what I was meant to do.
[02:12:07.497 --> 02:12:07.897]  Yes!
[02:12:08.698 --> 02:12:09.959]  That's what Jefferson called it.
[02:12:10.019 --> 02:12:12.461]  The animating contest of liberty.
[02:12:13.061 --> 02:12:22.189]  Thomas Jefferson was a gentleman, had like 170 IQ probably, you know, could speak six languages, wrote the Declaration of Independence, but he would bounce off the walls talking about freedom.
[02:12:24.823 --> 02:12:29.226]  You're either climbing the walls for freedom, folks, or you're in a coma and you're dead already.
[02:12:29.947 --> 02:12:33.750]  And see, what we're doing is, we're trying to bring everybody into the club.
[02:12:34.111 --> 02:12:49.284]  Because the globalists control people through information and folks not knowing how things really work, and thousands of flavors of disinfo and twisted information and false paradigms and half-truths, bologna sandwiches, horse manure sandwiches.
[02:12:50.044 --> 02:12:51.104]  All thrown at us.
[02:12:51.124 --> 02:12:52.684]  Two plus two equals five.
[02:12:53.045 --> 02:12:54.145]  Heather has two mommies.
[02:12:54.425 --> 02:12:56.145]  Just to confuse the kids.
[02:12:56.765 --> 02:12:58.585]  And then we're like, open-minded and liberal.
[02:12:58.826 --> 02:13:01.126]  You know, the average American's very classically liberal.
[02:13:01.346 --> 02:13:02.686]  Go, well, I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings.
[02:13:02.726 --> 02:13:04.607]  I guess that sounds kind of extreme, but okay.
[02:13:05.027 --> 02:13:06.987]  But it's all done premeditatedly.
[02:13:08.527 --> 02:13:09.367]  To hurt us.
[02:13:10.207 --> 02:13:11.268]  The globalists admit it.
[02:13:12.348 --> 02:13:15.128]  And so what I'm saying to you is, break with the new world order.
[02:13:15.668 --> 02:13:16.709]  Don't believe what I believe.
[02:13:16.769 --> 02:13:18.149]  Just tune in to what we're saying.
[02:13:18.409 --> 02:13:18.909]  Check it out.
[02:13:20.899 --> 02:13:22.920]  Go find YouTube videos from 10 years ago.
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:24.921]  Go watch my films from 18 years ago.
[02:13:25.201 --> 02:13:26.401]  Go see it for yourself.
[02:13:28.322 --> 02:13:30.063]  And find out how truthful we've been.
[02:13:30.183 --> 02:13:32.104]  Find out how visionary we've been.
[02:13:32.184 --> 02:13:37.907]  Find out how ahead of the game by many millions of light years we've been for one big reason.
[02:13:40.008 --> 02:13:41.648]  We didn't care what people said about us.
[02:13:41.828 --> 02:13:42.809]  That was politically.
[02:13:45.094 --> 02:13:46.154]  But that's only the surface.
[02:13:47.135 --> 02:13:47.915]  We were willing to do it.
[02:13:47.935 --> 02:13:53.257]  There were lots of people who knew the truth, they just weren't willing to do it because of ridicule, because of demonization, because of threats.
[02:13:54.018 --> 02:13:59.020]  Well, put me in that briar patch any day, that's where I'm alive, because I'm a fighter.
[02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:00.681]  I'm not a slave.
[02:14:01.761 --> 02:14:03.002]  So I wasn't afraid to be demonized.
[02:14:03.882 --> 02:14:13.486]  But more importantly, the globalists think you're idiots, they think you failed, they think you live in La La Land, brought up with television and fake culture, where Star Wars is your culture.
[02:14:16.317 --> 02:14:24.900]  And they think that you're already beaten, so they've written thousands of white papers and books and publications and speeches admitting everything.
[02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:40.325]  I have on the bookshelves, we've done videos on it, I've shown it to you many times, I have on the bookshelves here more than 20 books, we've done videos where I just go through them and show you the quotes, where world leaders, past and present, top scientists,
[02:14:41.616 --> 02:14:48.438]  People like the White House Science Czar openly admit they put fluoride in your water to reduce your fertility and lower your IQ to make you manageable.
[02:14:48.799 --> 02:14:55.181]  They write 1,100 page books admitting it, like Tragedy and Hope and EcoScience.
[02:14:56.501 --> 02:14:58.202]  You can read both books online for free.
[02:14:58.582 --> 02:14:59.762]  You're like, I'm not going to read 1,100 pages.
[02:15:00.143 --> 02:15:02.984]  Well, that's because you don't want to be informed and successful.
[02:15:03.304 --> 02:15:06.845]  If I was an evil person wanting to serve the globalists,
[02:15:08.539 --> 02:15:09.960]  I would read Tragedy and Hope.
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:12.021]  I would read the Technotronic Era.
[02:15:12.461 --> 02:15:26.968]  I would read all these globalist publications because 99.9% of their own minions don't do it and can't even operate and have to be sent to special Harvard and Yale double PhD secret programs that we've had members of on the show.
[02:15:27.989 --> 02:15:30.750]  Like Francis Boyle who wrote our chemical and biological weapons treaties.
[02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:33.631]  He was in there mulling the whole time to overturn them.
[02:15:35.752 --> 02:15:36.733]  He's on a fly list.
[02:15:38.166 --> 02:15:42.807]  This bothan spy, to use some cheesy Star Wars analogy, brought all this info out.
[02:15:43.587 --> 02:15:44.608]  And the list goes on and on.
[02:15:45.488 --> 02:15:49.369]  They get special PhDs to even be in the superclass.
[02:15:49.809 --> 02:15:51.009]  There's only a few thousand of them.
[02:15:51.629 --> 02:15:57.131]  You're getting the PhD education with an entertaining crazy Texan foaming at the mouth.
[02:15:58.511 --> 02:16:02.812]  The truth is I'm so exhausted I've got to get in here and get wound up to even be able to perform.
[02:16:04.933 --> 02:16:06.213]  The duty of exposing this.
[02:16:07.503 --> 02:16:10.045]  So you understand, you're getting valuable info.
[02:16:10.125 --> 02:16:11.807]  You could use the information here.
[02:16:12.848 --> 02:16:18.393]  If you were evil, or a sociopath, to actually get into the New World Order, did you ever know?
[02:16:18.573 --> 02:16:19.053]  But here's the deal.
[02:16:19.194 --> 02:16:25.359]  The average psycho or sociopath or dumb control freak is so stupid, they're just smart enough to prey on people.
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:29.283]  They're not smart enough to actually go to advanced levels.
[02:16:29.323 --> 02:16:30.304]  They're too lazy.
[02:16:30.564 --> 02:16:32.426]  Because evil is about quick power.
[02:16:33.146 --> 02:16:33.767]  Easy power.
[02:16:35.367 --> 02:16:36.327]  You're pathetic!
[02:16:36.887 --> 02:16:37.847]  Those of you that serve evil.
[02:16:38.508 --> 02:16:40.408]  I am here with those that do care.
[02:16:41.128 --> 02:16:42.008]  That want to be free.
[02:16:43.489 --> 02:16:45.409]  Exposing the bigger paradigm.
[02:16:46.449 --> 02:16:47.509]  And I'm proud of that fact.
[02:16:47.890 --> 02:16:50.170]  And I'm proud of all of you that spread the word about this broadcast.
[02:16:50.410 --> 02:16:56.431]  Just as I admire people like Lord Monckton, or Matt Drudge, or my reporters, or people that take action, or James O'Keefe.
[02:16:57.311 --> 02:16:59.692]  I admire all of you for what you've done.
[02:16:59.712 --> 02:17:02.592]  And when you walk up to me on the street corner, you're one of those at the bottom of the hour, McAdoo.
[02:17:02.612 --> 02:17:03.833]  And I've got a lot of news to cover.
[02:17:04.013 --> 02:17:04.953]  But I'm just ranting here today.
[02:17:07.102 --> 02:17:09.505]  It brings tears to my eyes when I go out in public.
[02:17:09.605 --> 02:17:10.806]  I can't go to Barnes & Noble's.
[02:17:10.866 --> 02:17:12.287]  Not bragging, it's showing how people are awake.
[02:17:12.708 --> 02:17:20.536]  And almost everyone I walk by, black, white, Hispanic, old, young, male, female, I can't go to the mall to Christmas shop.
[02:17:20.876 --> 02:17:22.098]  I have to buy everything online.
[02:17:22.438 --> 02:17:25.561]  I can't even go out in public because I can't get down the street now.
[02:17:25.862 --> 02:17:28.404]  Joe Biggs goes all over the country and gets mobbed now.
[02:17:28.624 --> 02:17:30.967]  He can't go to a restaurant and not have his dinner bought for him.
[02:17:31.127 --> 02:17:34.450]  He's been a reporter here for a couple years, a year and a half, whatever it is.
[02:17:34.791 --> 02:17:36.652]  The point is, freedom is popular.
[02:17:36.913 --> 02:17:37.713]  Freedom is big.
[02:17:37.974 --> 02:17:38.895]  Freedom is exploding.
[02:17:38.915 --> 02:17:42.178]  But we have to admit to ourselves how successful freedom's been.
[02:17:42.378 --> 02:17:45.201]  And I look at you counting on me, telling me how great I am.
[02:17:45.341 --> 02:17:46.002]  I'm nobody.
[02:17:46.642 --> 02:17:48.084]  I want to be free, just like you.
[02:17:48.264 --> 02:17:48.984]  I'm just like you.
[02:17:49.004 --> 02:17:52.067]  So when I'm looking at you, you're looking at me, I admire you too!
[02:17:53.342 --> 02:17:54.943]  And it's humbling, and I can't stand it!
[02:17:55.243 --> 02:17:56.164]  Because I know I'm weak.
[02:17:56.244 --> 02:17:56.964]  I know I fail.
[02:17:57.184 --> 02:17:58.145]  I know I'm not perfect.
[02:17:58.625 --> 02:18:02.027]  And to see all these men, women, and children counting on me is a heavy load.
[02:18:02.247 --> 02:18:02.847]  A heavy burden.
[02:18:03.088 --> 02:18:04.208]  I'm telling you something right now.
[02:18:04.408 --> 02:18:05.929]  I'm counting on you to take action.
[02:18:07.210 --> 02:18:08.671]  I'm counting on you to stand up.
[02:18:09.731 --> 02:18:10.692]  I'm waiting for you.
[02:18:11.192 --> 02:18:12.353]  And you've already taken action.
[02:18:12.513 --> 02:18:15.095]  But realize how important you are, and take action even harder.
[02:18:15.115 --> 02:18:16.996]  I know you've got a bunch of news there.
[02:18:17.056 --> 02:18:18.557]  I've been ranting about this subject.
[02:18:18.577 --> 02:18:19.097]  What do you have to say?
[02:18:19.582 --> 02:18:22.924]  I'm just, you know, my breath's kind of taken away because you're so right.
[02:18:22.984 --> 02:18:27.866]  I mean, there are just, they think that we are a huge sleeping joke.
[02:18:28.346 --> 02:18:35.650]  And they do this every single time they're about to go on recess or their Christmas holiday that's going to cost taxpayers $4 million.
[02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:40.812]  And then they do these awful things to the American people, laughing in our face.
[02:18:41.373 --> 02:18:48.256]  And then you go to the mainstream media and they're not even reporting on it until they might say, oh, well, I wonder why no one's worried about the economy, huh?
[02:18:48.516 --> 02:18:50.798]  It's their job to keep you in the dark till it's too late.
[02:18:50.878 --> 02:18:55.162]  It's so infuriating because it is time for the veil to be lifted.
[02:18:55.182 --> 02:19:02.988]  It's time for people to wake up and see that they are being purposefully put in a trance so that they can be controlled forever.
[02:19:03.449 --> 02:19:06.131]  And it's time for us to take our currency back.
[02:19:06.171 --> 02:19:06.692]  Absolutely.
[02:19:06.772 --> 02:19:14.058]  And it's time for Chuck Norris, Kurt Russell, Bruce Willis, all these people.
[02:19:15.889 --> 02:19:16.830]  It's time for the dude.
[02:19:17.691 --> 02:19:19.011]  And people say, who cares what Hollywood thinks?
[02:19:19.051 --> 02:19:21.673]  The enemy wants to make everybody think Hollywood's a bunch of communists.
[02:19:21.693 --> 02:19:22.114]  They're not.
[02:19:22.374 --> 02:19:23.435]  Most of them are patriots.
[02:19:23.695 --> 02:19:24.055]  It's time.
[02:19:24.115 --> 02:19:24.595]  I'm sorry.
[02:19:24.655 --> 02:19:25.996]  Chuck Norris has already done a lot of great stuff.
[02:19:26.196 --> 02:19:27.677]  I know he listens almost every day.
[02:19:28.078 --> 02:19:29.519]  Chuck, it's time for you to take action.
[02:19:29.559 --> 02:19:30.279]  Man, we need you.
[02:19:30.439 --> 02:19:30.960]  You're a leader.
[02:19:32.177 --> 02:19:38.301]  And it's not because you were in movies, it's because you were in the military, you were a patriot, a father, an international karate champion.
[02:19:38.521 --> 02:19:40.042]  People love you, they're looking for leadership.
[02:19:40.302 --> 02:19:41.303]  They sure are.
[02:19:41.323 --> 02:19:44.425]  You know, Chuck Norris doesn't like Donald Trump, he doesn't like his mannerisms and stuff.
[02:19:44.705 --> 02:19:46.847]  Then Chuck, we need you to get in here and run, baby.
[02:19:46.867 --> 02:19:50.109]  And I'm not putting Chuck Norris on the spot, it's just crazy.
[02:19:50.549 --> 02:19:52.070]  It's now time to take action.
[02:19:52.310 --> 02:19:53.971]  It's now time to put it all out there.
[02:19:54.331 --> 02:19:54.892]  It's time.
[02:19:54.952 --> 02:20:01.236]  And look, I know Chuck Norris thinks about his young kids and stuff, so do I. Hey, it's just, my children have no future if we don't beat these people.
[02:20:01.676 --> 02:20:03.059]  Okay, so I'm just all in.
[02:20:03.319 --> 02:20:07.888]  We got some final news with Leanne McAdoo, then we're going to be talking to Richard Reeves on the campaign trail 2016.

[02:21:38.564 --> 02:21:39.444]  Hey, Berkey Guy here.
[02:21:39.524 --> 02:21:41.225]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[02:21:41.365 --> 02:21:43.065]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[02:21:43.125 --> 02:21:44.966]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?
[02:21:45.086 --> 02:21:50.947]  The Berkey Guy is here to help you remove these and other potential contaminants from your water, thus helping you drink clean, purified water.

[02:22:03.050 --> 02:22:03.230]  That's 877-886-3653.
[02:22:08.817 --> 02:22:15.061]  Chronic inflammation is now known to block your ability to repair and compromises your immune system, making you more vulnerable to all diseases.
[02:22:15.521 --> 02:22:20.504]  Since poor diet, injuries or stress are all contributing factors, many people suffer from inflammation.
[02:22:20.704 --> 02:22:25.587]  Your body's number one means of neutralizing inflammation and the pain that it may be causing is glutathione.
[02:22:25.847 --> 02:22:30.170]  Glutathione is the body's number one peptide to neutralize free radicals and thus stop inflammation.
[02:22:30.390 --> 02:22:31.551]  Hi, my name is Jason.
[02:22:31.631 --> 02:22:32.572]  I'm 44 years old.
[02:22:32.732 --> 02:22:38.959]  For 10 years, I have been suffering from chronic pain in my abdomen and groin that radiated down into my feet.
[02:22:39.119 --> 02:22:46.347]  After three weeks on One World Way, the pain in my feet reduced by 50% and the overall pain in my body reduced significantly as well.
[02:22:46.447 --> 02:22:47.488]  I ran out of One World Way
[02:22:47.728 --> 02:22:49.229]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:22:49.409 --> 02:22:50.890]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.

[02:23:37.623 --> 02:23:41.584]  With a new year coming, it's time for a new way to look at weapon storage.
[02:23:41.884 --> 02:23:45.005]  Safes can't be accessed quickly and racks are unsafe for children.
[02:23:45.125 --> 02:23:47.625]  Covert Cabinets are the next level in home defense.
[02:23:47.705 --> 02:23:53.086]  They fit seamlessly into any home's decor and they provide quick access to firearms while keeping them uniquely hidden.
[02:23:53.126 --> 02:23:53.926]  Covert Cabinets.
[02:23:54.026 --> 02:23:55.727]  The ideal hidden storage solution.
[02:23:55.747 --> 02:23:57.147]  Custom made in the USA.
[02:23:57.247 --> 02:24:02.688]  Covert Cabinets are an elegant and practical alternative to the bulky and obvious storage systems of the past.
[02:24:02.768 --> 02:24:04.909]  Find out more at CovertCabinets.com.
[02:24:04.949 --> 02:24:06.209]  That's CovertCabinets.com.
[02:24:40.615 --> 02:24:42.599]  By the way, there's a big internal debate going on.
[02:24:42.759 --> 02:24:44.241]  I actually had Rob do come in here.
[02:24:44.261 --> 02:24:47.787]  I had Richard say to me, you're not really going to spoil Star Wars today.
[02:24:48.769 --> 02:24:50.051]  And I have it here in my stack.
[02:24:51.803 --> 02:25:04.628]  Well, when the Philadelphia police start talking about arresting people, if they do, even if you see the movie, or don't talk about it walking out, I'm going to protest this police state with checkpoints out front, searching people, and saying, don't bring toy guns.
[02:25:04.948 --> 02:25:15.472]  I mean, again, they take this American icon, because we have no culture, so it's our new archetype, they admit they wrote it off of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell, to be the new narrative of our culture.
[02:25:16.613 --> 02:25:18.914]  And it's not our culture, folks, it's a movie!
[02:25:19.861 --> 02:25:20.962]  I'm not even mad at everybody.
[02:25:21.222 --> 02:25:23.944]  I get getting into hype, but it's like when iPads were first coming out.
[02:25:24.805 --> 02:25:26.486]  I mean, now nobody cares about an iPad.
[02:25:26.566 --> 02:25:27.346]  You know, big deal.
[02:25:27.587 --> 02:25:28.908]  It was like, oh, the worshipfulness.
[02:25:28.948 --> 02:25:31.189]  And we got one of the first ones the first day.
[02:25:31.209 --> 02:25:32.010]  I drilled it.
[02:25:32.110 --> 02:25:32.510]  I killed it.
[02:25:33.251 --> 02:25:35.272]  To say humans are important, not machines.
[02:25:35.692 --> 02:25:36.993]  And it was all over CNN, you name it.
[02:25:37.053 --> 02:25:44.279]  And literally, I had crew members, good folks, not these guys, the other guys good too, getting upset about destroying good equipment.
[02:25:44.519 --> 02:25:44.999]  But they wouldn't.
[02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:46.941]  It's humans made it.
[02:25:47.001 --> 02:25:47.621]  It's mine.
[02:25:47.981 --> 02:25:48.602]  I paid for it.
[02:25:50.905 --> 02:25:55.887]  So the issue here is that the real world's going on all around us, and I'm not mad.
[02:25:56.167 --> 02:26:09.133]  It's an illustration, though, that I wish losing our rights in the Second Amendment and kids being, you know, enslaved in this child sex trade was as important as the new Star Wars movie with all the screwy actors.
[02:26:09.633 --> 02:26:10.774]  Leanne, do you have any comments on this?
[02:26:11.727 --> 02:26:12.407]  I agree with you.
[02:26:12.587 --> 02:26:20.369]  And there's a lot of articles out how this, just kind of pointing out how the Star Wars plot is frighteningly similar to what's going on in modern day America.
[02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:21.329]  So you're absolutely right.
[02:26:21.369 --> 02:26:21.929]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:26:21.949 --> 02:26:23.830]  And then Richard and Dew don't get to respond now.
[02:26:24.490 --> 02:26:25.270]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:26:25.310 --> 02:26:25.610]  I love them.
[02:26:25.710 --> 02:26:26.330]  I totally get it.
[02:26:26.511 --> 02:26:27.751]  Look, I want to go see it too.
[02:26:27.811 --> 02:26:28.831]  My son wants to go see it.
[02:26:29.591 --> 02:26:30.992]  Dew's taking him because I'm not going.
[02:26:31.072 --> 02:26:32.092]  I got work to do.
[02:26:32.792 --> 02:26:34.532]  But Dew's son and my son are friends.
[02:26:35.133 --> 02:26:36.233]  We should probably have them in.
[02:26:36.253 --> 02:26:38.553]  We should probably come in here when Dew's in here on the fourth hour and debate this.
[02:26:38.593 --> 02:26:41.034]  But Richard, do you want to comment now that I brought this up?
[02:26:44.167 --> 02:26:48.649]  What I'll say is, it's probably the biggest movie of the decade.
[02:26:48.709 --> 02:26:52.271]  No, no, no, you will die!
[02:26:52.851 --> 02:26:56.113]  Filmmaking is an art, and I appreciate filmmaking is an art.
[02:26:56.213 --> 02:26:56.653]  Good.
[02:26:56.893 --> 02:26:57.814]  And I really want to see it.
[02:26:58.194 --> 02:26:59.114]  Good.
[02:26:59.715 --> 02:27:00.155]  Good.
[02:27:00.195 --> 02:27:07.999]  Yeah, you need to issue a trigger warning for... But there are levels of importance, and I understand how it's not that significant compared to what's going on in our...
[02:27:08.459 --> 02:27:08.959]  No, I get it.
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:11.121]  And that's the total argument that's fair.
[02:27:11.501 --> 02:27:21.609]  I know it doesn't matter, I know it's stupid, but it's my little fun thing, my hobby, I want it, so I don't want to ruin my enjoyment, my R&R, and I 100% agree with you, and you're absolutely in the right.
[02:27:22.669 --> 02:27:28.314]  He gets it, and I understand that, and that's totally reasonable, don't tell me this book, the next book came out, I want to read it, don't tell me.
[02:27:28.594 --> 02:27:29.174]  I totally get it.
[02:27:29.955 --> 02:27:34.798]  But as long as you compartmentalize it as entertainment and not your god, now you're not idolizing it.
[02:27:35.078 --> 02:27:35.499]  Good point.
[02:27:36.581 --> 02:27:41.462]  But Robb Dew, I told him get me more spoilers to check my spoiler info, and he said I had someone else do it, I'm not doing it.
[02:27:41.883 --> 02:27:44.103]  Because Robb Dew is a Star Wars nerd.
[02:27:44.723 --> 02:27:47.784]  He gave me a Star Wars sweater last year.
[02:27:48.064 --> 02:27:52.766]  But is he one of the more than a thousand people that have joined officially the religion of the Jedi?
[02:27:54.486 --> 02:27:55.267]  No, I didn't know that.
[02:27:55.287 --> 02:28:03.389]  That's real, and he's not... Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic.
[02:28:05.584 --> 02:28:09.627]  I don't... How dare you say you're going to spoil Star Wars?
[02:28:12.088 --> 02:28:13.649]  Evacuate in a moment of triumph?
[02:28:14.470 --> 02:28:16.591]  I think you underestimate their chances.
[02:28:17.131 --> 02:28:18.692]  See, now, who's the real Star Wars nerd?
[02:28:18.712 --> 02:28:20.693]  I could quote all the movies.
[02:28:21.734 --> 02:28:26.037]  But that's because... That's because... I mean, I could quote any movie I've seen a few times.
[02:28:27.318 --> 02:28:29.319]  The truth is, folks, I'm not gay.
[02:28:29.339 --> 02:28:32.241]  But I'm going to make an announcement here that's actually an admission.
[02:28:32.741 --> 02:28:34.202]  I got a crush on Emperor Palpatine.
[02:28:35.305 --> 02:28:35.885]  The Gay Fish.
[02:28:36.905 --> 02:28:37.506]  The Gay Fish.
[02:28:38.106 --> 02:28:39.206]  That's actually his codename.
[02:28:40.366 --> 02:28:40.886]  Fish Tank!
[02:28:40.926 --> 02:28:41.467]  Fish Tank!
[02:28:42.787 --> 02:28:47.188]  Man, I don't know what's going on today, but I worked out really hard this morning.
[02:28:47.228 --> 02:28:53.990]  I've had one cup of coffee, a little bit of Aromate, and I am literally on fire with energy right now.
[02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:56.290]  Well, that's excellent, because that's what we need right now.
[02:28:57.110 --> 02:29:00.691]  I'm glad to see that you are not one of the people entranced.
[02:29:00.911 --> 02:29:02.952]  To quote Palpatine, help me, I'm weak!
[02:29:05.871 --> 02:29:08.813]  It's, what's funny is that you are literally like this every single day.
[02:29:08.933 --> 02:29:11.935]  It's not just that it's Star Wars is in the headlines today.
[02:29:11.955 --> 02:29:13.536]  I don't know why I have so much energy.
[02:29:15.417 --> 02:29:17.098]  Now, I don't have as much energy at night, though.
[02:29:17.358 --> 02:29:18.919]  You know, if I eat a big meal, it's bye-bye.
[02:29:19.199 --> 02:29:20.880]  Well, that's because you're supposed to go to sleep at night.
[02:29:21.561 --> 02:29:22.101]  Oh, really?
[02:29:22.221 --> 02:29:22.581]  Yes!
[02:29:23.062 --> 02:29:24.703]  Just, it's your body's natural thing.
[02:29:25.643 --> 02:29:26.344]  Newsflash!
[02:29:26.564 --> 02:29:29.766]  That's the thing, I could be bouncing off the walls and I just lay down within five minutes, I'm pshhh, bye-bye.
[02:29:31.195 --> 02:29:32.055]  Lian, stay there.
[02:29:32.115 --> 02:29:33.156]  We got Richard Reeves coming up.
[02:29:33.176 --> 02:29:34.256]  I want you to finish that news first.
[02:29:34.276 --> 02:29:34.976]  We're going to Richard Reeves.
[02:29:35.216 --> 02:29:38.338]  Free shipping, folks, on everything through December 18th.
[02:29:38.438 --> 02:29:39.298]  Order by tomorrow at noon.
[02:29:39.318 --> 02:29:41.919]  You'll get your package before Christmas.
[02:29:42.019 --> 02:29:43.780]  And we need you to fund the operation.
[02:29:44.220 --> 02:29:46.961]  I mean, look, there's lots of fantasy movies about engaging dark empires.
[02:29:47.281 --> 02:29:48.281]  This is an info war.
[02:29:48.581 --> 02:29:55.764]  And I can tell you right now, folks, that we're the equivalent of a major attack cruiser blasting the Death Star right now.
[02:29:56.084 --> 02:29:58.665]  And we sent our reporters out to go inside enemy operations.
[02:29:58.925 --> 02:29:59.825]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.305 --> 02:30:01.946]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.966 --> 02:30:09.248]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:11.429 --> 02:30:13.669]  Christmas has come early, thanks to Congress.
[02:30:13.930 --> 02:30:19.671]  The new tax break package being voted on this week will cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years.
[02:30:20.011 --> 02:30:23.412]  And it sees presents for NASCAR, horse racing, and more.
[02:30:23.632 --> 02:30:24.393]  But that's not all.
[02:30:24.693 --> 02:30:28.534]  The 233-page bill is one of two parts of legislation.
[02:30:28.854 --> 02:30:36.222]  New House Speaker Paul Ryan unveiled on Wednesday, the other being a massive $1.1 trillion spending bill.
[02:30:36.683 --> 02:30:47.475]  In total, Congress's spending binge funds the climate deal, Planned Parenthood, makes it harder to repeal Obamacare, and a cybersecurity bill has even been hacked in for good measure.
[02:30:47.975 --> 02:30:52.176]  By the way, there's no plan for how to pay for this big fat budget buster.
[02:30:52.496 --> 02:31:03.820]  Both are expected to pass both Houses of Congress by the end of this week and signed into law by President Obama after he returns from a $3.7 million holiday vacation.
[02:31:04.180 --> 02:31:06.561]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[02:31:09.352 --> 02:31:16.159]  In the 15 year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered 6 months free at Christmas.
[02:31:16.259 --> 02:31:18.962]  We've always offered 5 months free.
[02:31:19.142 --> 02:31:24.707]  But since I announced 6 free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of signups.
[02:31:25.068 --> 02:31:26.729]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[02:31:28.471 --> 02:31:31.454]  It's grown into Infowars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[02:31:31.774 --> 02:31:40.282]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:40.723 --> 02:31:51.453]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's, you also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously using your username.
[02:31:51.713 --> 02:31:59.123]  You can also sign up for a trial month and only pay $5.95, and then 20 of you and your friends and family can watch PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:31:59.283 --> 02:32:01.365]  Get 20 memberships at half price.
[02:32:01.546 --> 02:32:03.368]  Be the Paul Revere in your community.
[02:32:03.468 --> 02:32:07.013]  That's six months free when you sign up for a year at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:32:09.096 --> 02:32:12.318]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:12.619 --> 02:32:20.625]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:20.865 --> 02:32:25.888]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:32:26.269 --> 02:32:28.570]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:32:28.811 --> 02:32:30.592]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:32:38.982 --> 02:32:39.902]  BrainForce is here.
[02:32:40.082 --> 02:32:42.183]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:32:42.303 --> 02:32:47.024]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:32:47.284 --> 02:32:50.445]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:32:50.565 --> 02:32:53.786]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:32:54.066 --> 02:32:55.846]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:32:56.046 --> 02:33:00.027]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.
[02:33:00.147 --> 02:33:05.648]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:33:12.978 --> 02:33:14.640]  Knock them dead, kid.
[02:33:14.920 --> 02:33:17.042]  Richard's in Iowa City, Iowa, correct?
[02:33:18.463 --> 02:33:19.844]  Correct.
[02:33:19.884 --> 02:33:28.271]  We now take you live to the intergalactic fleet invasion of Plandethu, the bug planet.
[02:33:31.574 --> 02:33:36.118]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:36.198 --> 02:33:37.820]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:39.642 --> 02:33:44.527]  We're going to Richard in a moment, but actually at a fundraiser recently, we know Hillary's been fighting with Obama.
[02:33:44.827 --> 02:33:47.629]  They almost ran Biden against Hillary.
[02:33:49.151 --> 02:33:53.315]  And Obama and Hillary fought with each other a lot in the campaign back in 2008.
[02:33:56.518 --> 02:34:04.905]  They have released, actually CNN has released footage, shocking footage, of Obama battling with Hillary verbally.
[02:34:06.065 --> 02:34:12.148]  Uh, in a debate, privately with some fundraisers, only about 10 fundraisers in the room, uh, just a few weeks ago.
[02:34:12.168 --> 02:34:14.309]  This footage has never before been seen.
[02:34:14.429 --> 02:34:15.549]  It is shocking.
[02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:20.652]  Uh, well, just to see Hillary with her makeup off, because there was video in the room.
[02:34:21.412 --> 02:34:22.993]  So this was from a security camera.
[02:34:23.013 --> 02:34:24.954]  Uh, this is breaking news.
[02:34:24.994 --> 02:34:25.914]  Ladies and gentlemen, here it is.
[02:34:27.135 --> 02:34:28.335]  You have lost.
[02:34:38.509 --> 02:34:40.050]  He's a traitor!
[02:34:40.330 --> 02:34:41.471]  He is a traitor!
[02:34:42.872 --> 02:34:43.413]  Anakin!
[02:34:45.374 --> 02:34:46.975]  Don't let them kill me!
[02:34:51.267 --> 02:34:58.773]  I can't hold it any longer.
[02:34:59.833 --> 02:35:00.274]  I can't.
[02:35:02.255 --> 02:35:02.695]  I'm weak.
[02:35:03.296 --> 02:35:07.159]  I'm too weak.
[02:35:07.359 --> 02:35:09.660]  I can't hold on any longer.
[02:35:10.341 --> 02:35:12.863]  I'm going to end this once and for all.
[02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:16.310]  I'm too weak!
[02:35:17.210 --> 02:35:18.291]  Oh, don't kill me!
[02:35:18.311 --> 02:35:18.931]  I'm a woman!
[02:35:18.991 --> 02:35:19.491]  Please!
[02:35:19.731 --> 02:35:20.332]  Please, don't!
[02:35:20.472 --> 02:35:21.312]  Don't be racist!
[02:35:21.372 --> 02:35:25.314]  I'm telling her it gets in!
[02:35:25.334 --> 02:35:33.677]  I didn't know it was better without my girlfriend.
[02:35:34.077 --> 02:35:35.358]  Ah, bring in my girlfriend.
[02:35:36.018 --> 02:35:37.639]  So, uh, there you go.
[02:35:37.659 --> 02:35:40.080]  He did not have sexual relations with that woman.
[02:35:40.868 --> 02:35:45.330]  I can't believe a listener actually, oh my gosh, I didn't know they'd made these graphics.
[02:35:45.730 --> 02:35:47.531]  This is getting really ridiculous.
[02:35:48.772 --> 02:35:51.653]  They've been doing something secret back there, and is that what this is?
[02:35:52.733 --> 02:35:55.715]  Okay, I'm a reformed Star Wars nerd, I admit it, I apologize.
[02:35:55.915 --> 02:35:58.736]  Make sure you can see this at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:35:58.756 --> 02:36:02.258]  Alright, Richard Reeves is with us for the Balancing Hour with Leigh-Anne McAdoo.
[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:08.485]  And I want to now go to Iowa City, Iowa, where some of the key first primaries are coming up.
[02:36:08.785 --> 02:36:13.209]  And Richard Reeves off and on throughout the whole campaign season will be at the DNC, RNC, I'll probably go too.
[02:36:13.769 --> 02:36:17.412]  But Richard Reeves has got some folks on the street to give us their view on what's happening.
[02:36:17.452 --> 02:36:21.636]  But first, give us your view on following Hillary, following some of the other candidates.
[02:36:21.956 --> 02:36:23.798]  Richard Reeves for Infowars.com.
[02:36:24.598 --> 02:36:25.339]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:36:25.980 --> 02:36:29.863]  And yes, yesterday I did catch my first live Hillary Clinton event.
[02:36:30.319 --> 02:36:36.703]  And you were talking earlier in the show how you pull back the curtain and give us the inside baseball on what's really going on.
[02:36:36.723 --> 02:36:41.586]  So I'd like to give the folks out there a little bit inside baseball, how these live events really happen.
[02:36:41.867 --> 02:36:51.192]  Basically, you do go through almost airport level style security, but the difference is you don't have a bag to check in to go to your ultimate destination, the event itself.
[02:36:51.573 --> 02:36:53.054]  You can't even take in a monopod.
[02:36:53.094 --> 02:36:57.436]  Basically, you're going to be able to take in your car keys, coins, wallet, and your smartphone.
[02:36:57.697 --> 02:36:58.177]  That's it.
[02:36:58.550 --> 02:37:15.551]  So these are very controlled events and when it does come to press credential media, they're basically relegated to a dais a long way away from Hillary Clinton or the candidates and are not able to really ask questions and my suspicion actually is that they actually
[02:37:16.138 --> 02:37:16.878]  I don't think so.
[02:37:38.746 --> 02:37:39.246]  That's right.
[02:37:39.466 --> 02:37:45.487]  And I'm sure that was going on there because they had a couple people roaming around looking for people to ask questions, etc.
[02:37:45.527 --> 02:37:48.668]  So, yes, the inside baseball on that is highly controlled.
[02:37:48.688 --> 02:37:52.029]  So I think what it is is up to InfoWarriors to just go to these events.
[02:37:52.049 --> 02:37:56.850]  He had the biggest live human intelligence network on this planet, Alex.
[02:37:57.130 --> 02:37:58.850]  So the InfoWarriors should just go to these events.
[02:37:59.170 --> 02:38:06.712]  And that way they can get some good, cogent questions designed to get insightful answers out of Hillary Clinton so we can really expose her for what she is.
[02:38:06.972 --> 02:38:07.592]  Absolutely.
[02:38:07.853 --> 02:38:10.814]  Now, I know 10 minutes ago when you were getting ready, you had a few folks wanting to talk.
[02:38:10.854 --> 02:38:11.515]  Are they still out there?
[02:38:12.215 --> 02:38:13.196]  I do have Greg here.
[02:38:13.256 --> 02:38:14.676]  He's a millennial, 20 years old.
[02:38:14.696 --> 02:38:15.677]  Greg, come on in the shot.
[02:38:16.578 --> 02:38:21.640]  He tells me here, since there's not an NFL team in Iowa, that they're kind of split between the Packers, Vikings, and Bears.
[02:38:21.700 --> 02:38:22.161]  Hello, Greg.
[02:38:22.381 --> 02:38:22.561]  Hey.
[02:38:22.761 --> 02:38:23.301]  Go Pack, go.
[02:38:23.381 --> 02:38:26.023]  I want to ask him this.
[02:38:26.783 --> 02:38:29.945]  What is his overall view of the 2016 election?
[02:38:30.085 --> 02:38:30.626]  Who does he like?
[02:38:31.486 --> 02:38:34.768]  What's your overall view of the 2016 election so far?
[02:38:34.788 --> 02:38:35.228]  Who do you like?
[02:38:37.537 --> 02:38:40.698]  The election, it's tough to sort through all the candidates.
[02:38:41.118 --> 02:38:46.500]  Right now I'd say I'm looking for someone who's been consistent through their political career.
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:49.882]  Someone with integrity and who's going to stand up for things they believe in.
[02:38:50.422 --> 02:38:51.522]  Is that Senator Palpatine?
[02:38:52.743 --> 02:38:54.143]  So would that be Senator Palpatine?
[02:38:54.983 --> 02:38:57.224]  Yeah, that would be interesting.
[02:38:58.145 --> 02:39:01.766]  So are you more pumped up about the Star Wars movie coming out or about the election coming up?
[02:39:02.848 --> 02:39:06.670]  I, you know, the election's gonna do something real in everyone's lives, so probably the election.
[02:39:06.690 --> 02:39:07.010]  Good!
[02:39:07.050 --> 02:39:10.972]  I wanted to see if, okay, so ask him, who does he like best?
[02:39:12.172 --> 02:39:13.093]  Who do you like best?
[02:39:13.393 --> 02:39:16.194]  Boil it down to, I mean, who are you liking on what side, what party?
[02:39:16.234 --> 02:39:16.494]  Tell us.
[02:39:17.255 --> 02:39:21.316]  Uh, John Kasich on the Republican side, Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side.
[02:39:21.757 --> 02:39:23.497]  Oh my gosh, so let me ask him a question.
[02:39:23.898 --> 02:39:26.559]  So he likes it when Kasich talks about giving Russia a bloody nose?
[02:39:27.479 --> 02:39:31.441]  So do you like it when there's talk about John Kasich giving Russia a bloody nose?
[02:39:32.332 --> 02:39:33.593]  Giving Russia a bloody nose?
[02:39:33.653 --> 02:39:36.494]  Yeah, in the last debate, that's what he said, or recently he said that.
[02:39:37.715 --> 02:39:40.696]  Yeah, you know, I mean, foreign policy, it's a difficult thing to play.
[02:39:42.097 --> 02:39:46.820]  Russia overall, I think we need to understand that they're going to be our friend.
[02:39:47.860 --> 02:39:54.504]  They're being aggressive right now, which I mean, you've got to talk them down.
[02:39:54.524 --> 02:39:56.885]  How would a bloody nose work into that?
[02:39:58.554 --> 02:40:00.816]  I mean, I did watch the most recent Republican debate.
[02:40:01.036 --> 02:40:03.417]  Probably look stupid, but you know... No, you don't look stupid.
[02:40:03.437 --> 02:40:04.297]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:40:04.377 --> 02:40:05.738]  Alex says you don't look stupid.
[02:40:05.878 --> 02:40:06.619]  Oh, thanks, Alex.
[02:40:06.699 --> 02:40:11.201]  Ask him if he knows that Bernie Sanders killed the Audit the Federal Reserve Bill to protect the slime banks.
[02:40:11.221 --> 02:40:13.222]  It's not about being worse, it's about being reasonable.
[02:40:13.322 --> 02:40:13.743]  Let me ask this.
[02:40:14.043 --> 02:40:17.205]  Do you know that Bernie Sanders killed... What was it, Alex?
[02:40:17.265 --> 02:40:18.225]  Audit the Fed Bill.
[02:40:19.626 --> 02:40:22.247]  Bernie Sanders killed the Audit the Fed Bill.
[02:40:22.468 --> 02:40:23.028]  What do you say about that?
[02:40:24.130 --> 02:40:29.031]  Yeah, you know, the thing you gotta enjoy about Bernie Sanders is the guy wants to bring people together.
[02:40:29.271 --> 02:40:30.591]  He wants to be honest.
[02:40:30.991 --> 02:40:34.492]  He's stood on his same pillars through his entire political career.
[02:40:35.232 --> 02:40:36.932]  So, I mean, that's what I look for in a candidate.
[02:40:36.992 --> 02:40:41.033]  No, he's an absolute Judas Goat who stabbed Ron Paul in the back at the exact correct moment.
[02:40:41.293 --> 02:40:43.294]  He should probably take economics next semester.
[02:40:43.314 --> 02:40:47.054]  He's pretty much a Judas Goat that's just stabbing people in the back and selling out the people.
[02:40:47.414 --> 02:40:48.595]  He's not really there.
[02:40:48.655 --> 02:40:50.935]  He voted against all of the Fed Bill, which that's one of the biggest
[02:40:51.842 --> 02:41:00.488]  So we're talking about like an expansionary money policy?
[02:41:00.548 --> 02:41:10.554]  Well, I mean, it's been proven through time that we can take action through the Fed to help global crises in the financial sector, macroeconomics.
[02:41:11.134 --> 02:41:14.456]  So we need to have bail-ins, trillions of dollars in the mega-banks that gang-rape us.
[02:41:14.617 --> 02:41:15.097]  I understand.
[02:41:15.357 --> 02:41:19.840]  So it's a matter of bail-ins and bail-outs for the big banks, and meanwhile,
[02:41:20.693 --> 02:41:24.857]  The people, middle-in-class, middle-coming-in-class people have less money?
[02:41:25.458 --> 02:41:31.023]  Well, I mean, I think you'd find Bernie Sanders is fighting for the middle class at the same time if you talked to any economist.
[02:41:31.827 --> 02:41:34.828]  Ask them about what you think would happen if we hadn't bailed out the banks.
[02:41:35.069 --> 02:41:37.990]  We're looking at a credit crisis where no one would be able to get loans.
[02:41:38.410 --> 02:41:41.912]  All of a sudden, mortgages... And now, we're in the same spot with bigger derivatives than ever.
[02:41:42.792 --> 02:41:47.614]  And now, potentially, we've got a bigger bubble than ever and in the same spot with more derivatives.
[02:41:47.974 --> 02:41:51.616]  So, potentially, they just staved off that crisis that you're talking about, are they not?
[02:41:52.976 --> 02:41:57.178]  Well, I mean, the action following the bill hasn't been as much as you would like to see.
[02:41:57.198 --> 02:42:01.080]  Obviously, the banks are huge now, too big to fail.
[02:42:01.581 --> 02:42:02.363]  Too big to fail.
[02:42:02.763 --> 02:42:03.625]  Too big to exist.
[02:42:10.675 --> 02:42:13.496]  Look, this guy is a perfect example of what I call a useful idiot.
[02:42:14.157 --> 02:42:18.779]  And I don't mean that to be mean to him, but these people are preying on him, so I'll just talk straight to him, something he never had in his life.
[02:42:19.779 --> 02:42:28.784]  Just for viewers, this exhibit here on screen, he's just parroting establishment talking points to the T. And there's no use probably really talking to him at this point.
[02:42:30.204 --> 02:42:31.105]  He just doesn't get it.
[02:42:31.125 --> 02:42:34.366]  He doesn't know we have a predatory globalist establishment that's hijacked the country.
[02:42:36.247 --> 02:42:36.947]  Greg, one last question.
[02:42:37.047 --> 02:42:42.128]  Do you think we have any predators in the government and that the establishment is out there to help or hurt us?
[02:42:42.148 --> 02:42:44.269]  As in do I think the government's working for us or against us, basically?
[02:42:44.289 --> 02:42:44.809]  Yeah, you know, I mean,
[02:43:01.977 --> 02:43:03.658]  There's certain types of people everywhere.
[02:43:03.678 --> 02:43:06.600]  I think the government overall is a decent institution.
[02:43:07.320 --> 02:43:11.362]  What is your profession right now?
[02:43:12.063 --> 02:43:12.723]  My profession?
[02:43:13.363 --> 02:43:19.407]  Well, I'm a college student studying accounting and I also work as a bartender at a restaurant.
[02:43:20.713 --> 02:43:22.174]  Yeah, so he's clearly very educated.
[02:43:22.394 --> 02:43:23.535]  It's just that he's educated.
[02:43:23.575 --> 02:43:25.596]  I mean, I even feel bad he can't hear me say this.
[02:43:25.636 --> 02:43:26.796]  He'll watch it on YouTube later.
[02:43:26.877 --> 02:43:28.878]  I mean, just the helplessness.
[02:43:28.998 --> 02:43:31.419]  And I guarantee it's been weeks with him showing him all the proof.
[02:43:32.159 --> 02:43:37.022]  And it's just... Well, you've got to undo all of that programming that he's got.
[02:43:37.442 --> 02:43:39.043]  And that's the thing that's so frightening.
[02:43:39.263 --> 02:43:40.744]  He is intelligent.
[02:43:40.884 --> 02:43:42.745]  I mean, clearly he can hold a good conversation.
[02:43:42.765 --> 02:43:43.786]  Well, he can parrot things back.
[02:43:43.826 --> 02:43:44.046]  Right.
[02:43:44.306 --> 02:43:45.547]  But he's probably not dumb.
[02:43:45.587 --> 02:43:47.688]  He just thinks it's smart to parrot what they're saying.
[02:43:47.888 --> 02:43:48.088]  Right.
[02:43:48.448 --> 02:43:48.608]  Exactly.
[02:43:48.628 --> 02:43:49.429]  Because he's learned well.
[02:43:50.459 --> 02:43:55.545]  Ask him if he knows that the Bush family reportedly has a large portion of the Nazi horde.
[02:43:56.516 --> 02:43:59.577]  I'm sorry, Greg took off, so we're not able to ask him that question.
[02:43:59.737 --> 02:44:00.918]  He probably said it was a conspiracy theory.
[02:44:00.938 --> 02:44:02.978]  I was going to ask him about fluoride, he said that's not true.
[02:44:03.299 --> 02:44:14.543]  Rachel Maddow wrote an editorial, Richard, that last time I checked was in 300 plus newspapers, and I mean Chicago Tribune, I mean the biggest papers in the country, Washington Post.
[02:44:14.843 --> 02:44:18.204]  Guys, type in Alex Jones and click Google News.
[02:44:18.364 --> 02:44:19.745]  I meant to send this to you last night.
[02:44:19.765 --> 02:44:22.566]  It was hundreds and hundreds of articles with her saying
[02:44:23.706 --> 02:44:26.489]  A bunch of things I don't believe and I didn't say yet again.
[02:44:26.509 --> 02:44:29.411]  That I believe space aliens run the planet.
[02:44:30.292 --> 02:44:32.934]  That I believe tornadoes are being sent by the government.
[02:44:32.974 --> 02:44:35.617]  You know, when I said they had weather modification, they admit they do.
[02:44:35.657 --> 02:44:37.458]  I didn't say they sent a particular tornado.
[02:44:37.899 --> 02:44:40.861]  But who are they countering in hundreds of newspapers?
[02:44:41.242 --> 02:44:41.382]  Us.
[02:44:42.163 --> 02:44:44.224]  And just type in Alex Jones, you'll see the Rachel Maddow.
[02:44:44.264 --> 02:44:45.986]  I mean, you're talking hundreds of articles.
[02:44:46.787 --> 02:44:48.308]  Hundreds of places her article was published.
[02:44:48.328 --> 02:44:49.009]  Here's what was interesting.
[02:44:50.114 --> 02:44:58.397]  There were several hundred others, I spent like 30 minutes last night looking at this, several hundred others that were basically carbon copies written by other people the same day.
[02:44:58.697 --> 02:45:06.060]  So the word went out, probably a week ago, they had their article come out and it was in, let's not exaggerate, 300 or so with her.
[02:45:07.180 --> 02:45:10.302]  And 300 more from other people saying the same thing.
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:37.060]  No!
[02:45:37.261 --> 02:45:40.165]  Has family or themselves that took vaccines that almost killed them.
[02:45:40.546 --> 02:45:43.531]  But then they get on the news and say there's no adverse reactions, no problems.
[02:45:43.791 --> 02:45:45.333]  Leanne, I'm ranting here, but what do you have to say?
[02:45:45.899 --> 02:46:04.956]  Well, I just, you know, that's the job of the mainstream media, and that's evident to why journalism and jobs like that are going to the wayside, because they don't need them anymore, because all you have to do is just get your little talking point printout, and then the little robot comes out and tells you everything you need to know, and it's reprinted en masse all throughout the globe.
[02:46:05.076 --> 02:46:07.938]  If you're informed, repeat what Rachel Maddow says.
[02:46:07.958 --> 02:46:09.640]  That proves you're really intellectual.
[02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:11.962]  Only use what words and language she says.
[02:46:12.522 --> 02:46:14.604]  This week, the new word is Darth Vader.
[02:46:14.864 --> 02:46:15.564]  He's racist.
[02:46:15.804 --> 02:46:17.666]  Melissa Harris-Perry said so!
[02:46:18.026 --> 02:46:27.472]  She's not a scientific warfare expert from the foundations, running major universities dedicated to scrambling young people's brains into subservient, regurgitating minions.
[02:46:27.832 --> 02:46:29.573]  No, she's Melissa Harris-Perry.
[02:46:29.593 --> 02:46:31.014]  Can I ask a question?
[02:46:31.034 --> 02:46:31.434]  Help me, I'm weak.
[02:46:31.474 --> 02:46:32.355]  Does it all involve politics?
[02:46:33.216 --> 02:46:33.576]  Yes, sir.
[02:46:33.616 --> 02:46:34.216]  Richard, go ahead.
[02:46:35.017 --> 02:46:35.357]  Okay.
[02:46:35.637 --> 02:46:37.799]  Yeah, I was trying to round up another interviewee.
[02:46:38.219 --> 02:46:41.541]  But, you know, I've been watching Donald Trump a lot.
[02:46:42.368 --> 02:46:45.972]  And I think he is a master of human psychology.
[02:46:46.432 --> 02:46:51.117]  I think without even being president, we're seeing him impact things on a global scale.
[02:46:51.477 --> 02:46:54.420]  We're seeing him impact the relationship between the United States and Russia.
[02:46:54.780 --> 02:46:57.002]  We're seeing him impact the economy already.
[02:46:57.763 --> 02:47:03.168]  And I think even on the immigration issue, we're seeing an impact with him just talking the hard line on immigration.
[02:47:03.764 --> 02:47:12.591]  I can almost guarantee that we're seeing less illegal immigration already happening because those folks got to know that if Donald Trump becomes president, that they will have to go out.
[02:47:12.611 --> 02:47:16.494]  Well sure, and we've got to check who comes, and they can't just get free welfare right away.
[02:47:16.874 --> 02:47:17.295]  Duh!
[02:47:17.575 --> 02:47:19.796]  Nobody else does that, and they try to say it.
[02:47:19.856 --> 02:47:24.300]  But Richard, you were up here foaming at the mouth figuratively, not like me, but almost as bad.
[02:47:24.740 --> 02:47:25.460]  It's the delegates.
[02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:26.801]  They're going to steal the delegates.
[02:47:27.641 --> 02:47:28.362]  It's going to happen.
[02:47:28.642 --> 02:47:31.583]  And it's Jeb Bush and they run them because you've been a delegate yourself.
[02:47:31.623 --> 02:47:32.603]  You'll be a delegate this time.
[02:47:32.943 --> 02:47:34.584]  You're a precinct chairman and all that stuff.
[02:47:34.604 --> 02:47:37.945]  Down at the grassroots, as a political analyst, you get a clear shot at what's happening.
[02:47:38.365 --> 02:47:41.647]  But man, right after you said that, all these articles came out saying basically the same thing.
[02:47:42.007 --> 02:47:45.368]  And Jeb bragging that, I don't care if I get 1% of the vote.
[02:47:45.548 --> 02:47:47.129]  I'll control the Republican delegates.
[02:47:47.869 --> 02:47:48.429]  I'm king.
[02:47:48.649 --> 02:47:49.230]  I'm God.
[02:47:49.530 --> 02:47:52.231]  And then all his quotes to Trump, you will not be president.
[02:47:52.631 --> 02:47:55.975]  I want to talk to this next person, but I want to get your take on that than Leon Makadish.
[02:47:57.517 --> 02:47:59.178]  Well, that is exactly it.
[02:47:59.218 --> 02:48:04.324]  I mean that quote by Bush here recently where he says, I will guarantee that Trump will not be the nominee.
[02:48:04.745 --> 02:48:09.470]  And then you made that commentary the other day about how at the debate that Jeb Bush was
[02:48:10.026 --> 02:48:16.808]  Acting kind of mobster-ish, saying that, hey, you're not going to be the nominee by being belligerent or acting bombastically.
[02:48:17.208 --> 02:48:19.749]  So, yes, I definitely think the wheels are in motion.
[02:48:19.769 --> 02:48:29.871]  But also, a very powerful thing that you, that I've learned from you, is that when you expose these things, it's a big way in trying to... Well, when we expose them, we're just one focal point.
[02:48:29.891 --> 02:48:30.831]  You're absolutely right, Richard.
[02:48:30.851 --> 02:48:33.792]  I want to get to some other things out there and talk to this person who just walked up to you.
[02:48:33.832 --> 02:48:36.353]  But, Leanne McAdoo, your take on what he's saying.
[02:48:36.713 --> 02:48:42.295]  Well, it's absolutely right, because you're not going to learn about how the delegate thing works unless you come here to InfoWars.
[02:48:42.315 --> 02:48:51.499]  And it is so important, and that is one way how we the people, how you out there, can empower yourself and make sure that we're going to get someone in there that's actually going to do their job.
[02:48:52.059 --> 02:48:55.380]  But people have to understand how this deck is stacked.
[02:48:55.700 --> 02:48:57.521]  I mean, just look at the Democratic debates.
[02:48:57.661 --> 02:49:02.463]  There's only six of them, and they keep scheduling them on days when no one is going to watch.
[02:49:03.223 --> 02:49:04.865]  And it's sacked that way.
[02:49:04.945 --> 02:49:07.468]  People should vote against Hillary just because it's obviously rigged.
[02:49:07.968 --> 02:49:09.269]  It's obviously rigged.
[02:49:09.850 --> 02:49:11.011]  And it's rigged for Bush.
[02:49:12.637 --> 02:49:16.158]  Soros isn't a famous Nazi collaborator, the family made all their money with the Nazis?
[02:49:16.198 --> 02:49:20.400]  I mean, did my grandfathers fight World War II for nothing and almost both get killed?
[02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:22.200]  So a bunch of scum can run around?
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:23.441]  An Eddie Haskell Nazi?
[02:49:23.801 --> 02:49:24.801]  Absolutely, Leanne.
[02:49:24.941 --> 02:49:28.963]  And it'll be very interesting to find out if you do get a chance to ask Hillary a question.
[02:49:29.403 --> 02:49:38.526]  You know, in this debate, since now it's after we've had our first ISIS attack on the country, will they actually say radical Islam this time?
[02:49:38.966 --> 02:49:39.406]  Absolutely.
[02:49:39.446 --> 02:49:41.047]  Let's go back to Richard because I hear him talking.
[02:49:41.808 --> 02:49:46.210]  Richard, you know, I made the point that Trump's ace of spades is leaving the campaign.
[02:49:46.230 --> 02:49:47.811]  We'll talk about this after the break.
[02:49:47.831 --> 02:49:48.871]  We're about to talk to this voter.
[02:49:50.882 --> 02:49:53.323]  Leaving the campaign if they block him out or shill the delegates.
[02:49:53.523 --> 02:49:54.304]  He has no choice.
[02:49:54.424 --> 02:49:55.844]  I will not vote for Hillary or Jeb.
[02:49:56.124 --> 02:49:57.565]  I will support that third party run.
[02:49:57.965 --> 02:50:03.248]  He's got to get the Libertarians primed and ready for him to come in if they pull that shenanigan.
[02:50:03.408 --> 02:50:04.928]  But Richard, who's this fellow you're talking to?
[02:50:05.549 --> 02:50:07.089]  Okay, Alex, we have Rob here.
[02:50:07.570 --> 02:50:08.550]  He looks like a student.
[02:50:08.610 --> 02:50:09.590]  Rob, tell us, are you a student?
[02:50:09.770 --> 02:50:10.591]  Yes, I'm a senior.
[02:50:11.051 --> 02:50:11.511]  Who do you like?
[02:50:12.372 --> 02:50:14.012]  Who do you like in the presidential race?
[02:50:15.073 --> 02:50:18.955]  I'm going to have to say Ben Carson for right now.
[02:50:20.796 --> 02:50:21.336]  Ben Carson?
[02:50:21.437 --> 02:50:21.677]  Yeah.
[02:50:21.837 --> 02:50:23.178]  Tell us what you like about Ben Carson.
[02:50:23.558 --> 02:50:25.900]  You know, I really like his views, political views.
[02:50:27.422 --> 02:50:29.403]  He had a good debate on CNN the other night.
[02:50:29.864 --> 02:50:31.685]  What are some of the specific views that you like?
[02:50:33.087 --> 02:50:34.228]  Specific views?
[02:50:36.309 --> 02:50:40.093]  Well, anything that doesn't have to do with what Donald Trump believes.
[02:50:40.113 --> 02:50:43.556]  I think he's really just putting himself in a hole and
[02:50:44.908 --> 02:50:46.069]  So you don't like Donald Trump?
[02:50:46.810 --> 02:50:47.891]  So you don't like Donald Trump?
[02:50:47.931 --> 02:50:50.213]  Why do you, specifically, why do you not like Donald Trump?
[02:50:50.233 --> 02:50:51.595]  What about Donald Trump do you not like?
[02:50:51.855 --> 02:51:00.483]  Yeah, just the belief he has of the Muslims, you know, just... Tell, tell, tell, tell Walnut, tell him to stay right there.
[02:51:00.503 --> 02:51:02.305]  ...similar to what Hitler did.
[02:51:02.645 --> 02:51:02.985]  Excuse me.
[02:51:03.005 --> 02:51:03.346]  May I interrupt?
[02:51:03.386 --> 02:51:04.527]  We're going to take a break.
[02:51:04.587 --> 02:51:05.588]  I think we're going to break, right?
[02:51:05.608 --> 02:51:06.789]  Yeah, ask Peabrain to stay with us.
[02:51:07.209 --> 02:51:08.611]  In fact, tell him to call the Peabrain.
[02:51:08.751 --> 02:51:09.692]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:11.587 --> 02:51:12.548]  There's somebody in my house.
[02:51:13.088 --> 02:51:13.809]  Hurry, please.
[02:51:14.369 --> 02:51:16.991]  A home break-in happens every 22 seconds.

[02:52:09.525 --> 02:52:12.447]  Still wondering what to get that special someone that has everything?
[02:52:12.647 --> 02:52:22.435]  At ID Stronghold, we still find that a huge percentage of people do not yet have an RFID blocking wallet or purse to protect them from the new and growing threat of electronic pickpocketing.
[02:52:22.795 --> 02:52:36.125]  That's right, even though 40% of all new chipped payment cards shipped in 2014 contain a wireless interface called RFID that allows the account information to be skimmed by a thief passing near your cards, most people are still unprotected.
[02:52:36.525 --> 02:52:41.870]  The good news is that ID Stronghold makes luxurious leather wallets and other products that prevent this.
[02:52:42.271 --> 02:52:50.959]  ID Stronghold founded the entire RFID protection industry and has been protecting the RFID chips in government and military ID cards for over a decade.
[02:52:51.239 --> 02:52:56.965]  So go to idstronghold.com and get that loved one a stylish leather RFID blocking wallet or clutch.
[02:52:57.185 --> 02:52:58.887]  That's idstronghold.com.
[02:52:59.207 --> 02:53:01.834]  After all, wallets and purses have always been a great gift.

[02:53:32.483 --> 02:53:42.266]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:53:42.506 --> 02:53:48.768]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:53:49.008 --> 02:53:52.309]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[02:53:52.329 --> 02:53:54.170]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:53:54.410 --> 02:53:57.511]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:53:57.571 --> 02:53:59.672]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[02:54:17.724 --> 02:54:21.346]  Almost all students... I was talking about this 20 years ago, but it's mainstream media now.
[02:54:22.347 --> 02:54:26.810]  Limbaugh was talking about it 30 years ago, that most college degrees are worthless now.
[02:54:27.810 --> 02:54:31.513]  If it's not engineering, if it's not science, you can use it for toilet paper.
[02:54:32.294 --> 02:54:39.380]  We've got all these young victims spending 30, 50 grand a year to get toilet paper degrees that they'll end up having to have two or three jobs.
[02:54:39.821 --> 02:54:41.662]  I bet this guy thinks his degree's going to be worth something.
[02:54:41.682 --> 02:54:43.044]  I'm not being mean, he's just a victim.
[02:54:43.844 --> 02:54:50.208]  So I shouldn't make fun of him, but calling Donald Trump a Nazi when the radical Muslims aided Hitler and, you know, all of this.
[02:54:50.589 --> 02:54:57.694]  Ask him if he knows that Jimmy Carter banned Iranians from coming into the country and deported them during the hostage crisis.
[02:54:58.314 --> 02:54:59.675]  Ask the student that, Richard Reeves.
[02:55:00.395 --> 02:55:07.020]  Rob, do you know that Jimmy Carter banned Muslims from coming here from Iran during the Iranian crisis back in the 80s?
[02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:08.241]  I did not know that.
[02:55:08.261 --> 02:55:10.022]  I'm a little too young for that to know that.
[02:55:10.609 --> 02:55:12.170]  Well, why is he calling Trump a Nazi then?
[02:55:12.210 --> 02:55:13.331]  I mean, is Jimmy Carter a Nazi?
[02:55:13.491 --> 02:55:14.352]  Too young to know about that.
[02:55:14.372 --> 02:55:15.252]  Is Jimmy Carter a Nazi?
[02:55:15.292 --> 02:55:16.013]  Why is Trump a Nazi?
[02:55:16.753 --> 02:55:18.955]  Well, um, I wouldn't say he's a Nazi.
[02:55:18.995 --> 02:55:20.656]  I wouldn't say Donald Trump's a Nazi either.
[02:55:20.716 --> 02:55:21.217]  Somebody did.
[02:55:21.397 --> 02:55:29.002]  You know, if he didn't need to have ideas like that, it could be something maybe similar to that, and I don't think that's good for this country.
[02:55:29.443 --> 02:55:36.688]  So, asking, should Europe take on refugees, many of which are known to have been Al-Qaeda ISIS fighters?
[02:55:37.529 --> 02:55:41.692]  Should Europe take on refugees, many of which are known to be Al-Qaeda terrorist fighters?
[02:55:43.073 --> 02:55:43.893]  Um, no.
[02:55:44.194 --> 02:55:53.960]  I don't think Europe really has the grounds, or, you know, I don't think that it should be... But they've done it, and that's what Trump's trying to stop here.
[02:55:54.300 --> 02:56:02.386]  But that's what's happening in Europe, and that's what Trump's talking about trying to stop here, is because they've actually infiltrated Europe, and that's what's causing terrorist attacks like Paris, France.
[02:56:03.194 --> 02:56:05.416]  I think out in Europe, more in Paris.
[02:56:05.756 --> 02:56:08.579]  Ask him if he thinks San Bernardino was terror.
[02:56:09.260 --> 02:56:10.000]  A little more extreme.
[02:56:11.762 --> 02:56:13.183]  Ask him if San Bernardino was terror.
[02:56:13.284 --> 02:56:15.446]  No, we don't have severe action like that yet.
[02:56:15.926 --> 02:56:17.267]  What about San Bernardino?
[02:56:17.948 --> 02:56:18.749]  Battle with ISIS.
[02:56:19.189 --> 02:56:21.191]  Rob, do you think San Bernardino was terror?
[02:56:21.992 --> 02:56:22.212]  Sorry?
[02:56:22.752 --> 02:56:25.275]  San Bernardino, California, the attack in San Bernardino.
[02:56:25.435 --> 02:56:26.496]  Do you think that was terror attack?
[02:56:28.423 --> 02:56:31.304]  I don't know enough about that to really put my opinion out.
[02:56:31.324 --> 02:56:34.225]  I'm not really sure.
[02:56:34.885 --> 02:56:38.626]  Ask him if he agrees with Yale students that told Fox News they want to ban free speech.
[02:56:39.246 --> 02:56:41.407]  Ask him if criticizing Muslims should be banned.
[02:56:42.227 --> 02:56:43.848]  Should criticizing Muslims be banned?
[02:56:45.308 --> 02:56:45.849]  Christianity?
[02:56:46.269 --> 02:56:48.189]  No, should criticizing Muslims be banned?
[02:56:49.330 --> 02:56:56.332]  I don't think criticizing Muslims, but I think people need to have more of an open mind towards
[02:56:57.659 --> 02:56:59.920]  Well, I don't support that at all.
[02:56:59.940 --> 02:57:00.521]  That's not my belief.
[02:57:00.561 --> 02:57:01.781]  Yeah, be open-minded.
[02:57:27.833 --> 02:57:28.593]  I think that's wrong.
[02:57:28.933 --> 02:57:31.034]  I think there's certain limits to open up.
[02:57:31.054 --> 02:57:32.254]  Well, that's who we're bringing in, boy!
[02:57:32.274 --> 02:57:34.274]  I think that takes it a little too far.
[02:57:34.914 --> 02:57:35.935]  Well, and that's the danger.
[02:57:35.995 --> 02:57:38.715]  That's who we're bringing in, though, potentially, are people that believe in that.
[02:57:39.095 --> 02:57:39.335]  Right.
[02:57:40.516 --> 02:57:40.696]  So.
[02:57:41.556 --> 02:57:41.816]  Yeah.
[02:57:41.876 --> 02:57:43.256]  It's arrested development, folks.
[02:57:43.296 --> 02:57:44.136]  That's what you're witnessing.
[02:57:44.156 --> 02:57:45.197]  This guy's like a three-year-old.
[02:57:45.697 --> 02:57:49.357]  Kind of take away... Leanne, you think that's a manly man right there?
[02:57:49.997 --> 02:57:51.038]  Help me, I'm weak.
[02:57:51.098 --> 02:57:52.838]  Different ideas that everyone has, I think.
[02:57:54.078 --> 02:57:55.499]  You know, we'll figure it out.
[02:57:55.879 --> 02:57:56.639]  Unlimited power!
[02:57:58.607 --> 02:58:01.388]  Um, Rob, thank you very much.
[02:58:01.448 --> 02:58:02.768]  Ask him if he likes Emperor Palpatine.
[02:58:03.008 --> 02:58:04.029]  Oh, one more question.
[02:58:04.229 --> 02:58:05.929]  Do you like Emperor Palpatine?
[02:58:07.110 --> 02:58:08.030]  Um, who is that?
[02:58:08.230 --> 02:58:08.630]  I'm not sure.
[02:58:08.970 --> 02:58:09.991]  Uh, Star Wars character.
[02:58:10.071 --> 02:58:11.031]  Star Wars character.
[02:58:11.091 --> 02:58:12.151]  I'm not into Star Wars.
[02:58:12.171 --> 02:58:13.712]  Okay, ask him if he likes George Washington.
[02:58:14.512 --> 02:58:15.692]  Do you like George Washington?
[02:58:16.532 --> 02:58:20.294]  Yeah, he's, he founded a country, uh, well, first president, so yeah.
[02:58:20.434 --> 02:58:21.094]  Well, I love him.
[02:58:21.174 --> 02:58:23.335]  I apologize to whatever his name is.
[02:58:23.615 --> 02:58:24.195]  Bye-bye.
[02:58:25.451 --> 02:58:26.372]  Take your vaccines.
[02:58:26.893 --> 02:58:27.253]  We'll see you.
[02:58:27.673 --> 02:58:29.035]  YouTube channel, Alex Jones Channel.
[02:58:29.315 --> 02:58:29.475]  USA.
[02:58:29.655 --> 02:58:30.596]  Richard Reeves.
[02:58:30.696 --> 02:58:32.357]  Come back for five minutes with me and McAdoo.
[02:58:32.377 --> 02:58:33.498]  In fact, you know, I've been obnoxious.
[02:58:33.919 --> 02:58:34.820]  I've run over McAdoo.
[02:58:34.880 --> 02:58:37.982]  I'm gonna let you and McAdoo host the next five minutes.
[02:58:38.403 --> 02:58:41.025]  And then, my gosh, don't you want McAdoo to just continue on with Rob Doo?
[02:58:41.245 --> 02:58:42.606]  She'll throw it to him at 8 after.
[02:58:42.987 --> 02:58:46.029]  Leeann McAdoo and Richard Reeves from Iowa City, Iowa.
[02:58:46.050 --> 02:58:46.550]  Straight ahead.
[02:58:46.810 --> 02:58:47.731]  Infowars.com.

[02:58:59.560 --> 02:59:03.282]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:59:03.522 --> 02:59:09.646]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:59:09.846 --> 02:59:16.811]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:59:17.111 --> 02:59:25.961]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[02:59:26.241 --> 02:59:32.168]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:59:32.408 --> 02:59:35.532]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections and
[02:59:35.792 --> 02:59:36.613]  We're good to go.
[03:00:02.012 --> 03:00:18.306]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:19.306 --> 03:00:25.592]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:28.764 --> 03:00:31.206]  Alright, you are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:31.447 --> 03:00:34.870]  I am Leanne McAdoo taking you into the Overdrive Hour.
[03:00:34.890 --> 03:00:36.471]  Rob Dew will be hosting.
[03:00:36.491 --> 03:00:38.313]  I'm going to throw it over to him about 8 after.
[03:00:38.913 --> 03:00:41.936]  But Richard Reeves, we still are talking to you there.
[03:00:42.056 --> 03:00:43.738]  You are in Iowa, I believe, correct?
[03:00:44.423 --> 03:00:45.163]  That's right, Leanne.
[03:00:45.323 --> 03:00:46.624]  Iowa City, Iowa.
[03:00:46.824 --> 03:00:51.145]  And today I'm not doing my frothing bulldog look today.
[03:00:51.545 --> 03:00:53.126]  But yes, I'm in Iowa City.
[03:00:53.286 --> 03:00:55.326]  It's been a very interesting trip so far.
[03:00:55.646 --> 03:00:57.267]  Went to the Hillary event, as you heard earlier.
[03:00:57.667 --> 03:01:00.088]  But one thing I want to talk about is going back to the debate.
[03:01:00.728 --> 03:01:04.109]  One of the Freudian slips that occurred at the early debate
[03:01:04.557 --> 03:01:06.018]  And I believe it was George Pataki.
[03:01:06.398 --> 03:01:09.199]  He referred to Donald Trump as if he isn't president already.
[03:01:09.259 --> 03:01:09.859]  Did you hear that?
[03:01:09.879 --> 03:01:10.380]  Wow.
[03:01:10.820 --> 03:01:12.641]  I did not hear that Freudian slip.
[03:01:12.801 --> 03:01:15.742]  Yeah, he really is putting himself out there as the frontrunner.
[03:01:15.762 --> 03:01:16.442]  He's the winner.
[03:01:16.462 --> 03:01:18.303]  He's not backing down.
[03:01:19.024 --> 03:01:21.625]  Well, and in fact, you know, I heard that Freudian slip.
[03:01:21.685 --> 03:01:24.126]  I was monitoring the audio of that of that debate.
[03:01:24.606 --> 03:01:32.830]  And when I heard that Freudian slip, I thought, you know, he's just saying more than he even knows, because I'm here to tell you, I think Donald Trump is already impacting the economy.
[03:01:33.194 --> 03:01:37.858]  I think he's already impacting the level of illegal immigration being lowered.
[03:01:38.298 --> 03:01:47.265]  And I think that, you know, the article today with Putin showing respect towards Donald Trump, I think he's already having an impact in foreign affairs.
[03:01:47.325 --> 03:01:49.087]  So he's not even been elected president.
[03:01:49.127 --> 03:01:50.708]  He's not even the Republican nominee yet.
[03:01:50.748 --> 03:01:53.631]  We haven't even seen a primary caucus or a primary vote.
[03:01:53.991 --> 03:01:55.032]  And so it's exciting to see.
[03:01:55.640 --> 03:02:07.204]  It is very exciting to see and you know it's interesting that the Republican presidential candidates have shown that they are all ready, they're willing, they've got an appetite for these debates.
[03:02:08.224 --> 03:02:14.586]  Meanwhile on the other side you've got the Democrats who keep, they've got like six debates and they're scheduled on the weekends.
[03:02:14.746 --> 03:02:19.868]  I believe the last one was scheduled when there was some big football game or something so they knew no one would be turning in.
[03:02:20.288 --> 03:02:22.909]  Yeah, and then this next one is also going to be on a Saturday.
[03:02:22.929 --> 03:02:24.869]  No one's going to be paying any attention.
[03:02:24.909 --> 03:02:31.371]  And they're doing this, of course, to stack the deck in favor of Hillary because they don't want the other candidates to even get any airtime.
[03:02:31.491 --> 03:02:32.991]  Everybody knows Hillary Clinton's name.
[03:02:33.311 --> 03:02:35.652]  They'll probably just vote for her because she's a woman.
[03:02:36.192 --> 03:02:38.233]  And so, you know, it's pretty ridiculous.
[03:02:38.273 --> 03:02:38.913]  And it's interesting.
[03:02:39.893 --> 03:02:45.860]  The Republicans, the entire debate this last time was about terror, you know, and national security.
[03:02:46.141 --> 03:02:57.715]  So it'll be interesting if they do that same thing with the Democratic presidential candidates to see if they will actually say radical Islam this time around, now that it's a post-terror attack.
[03:02:58.513 --> 03:02:59.693]  Leanne, don't hold your breath on that.
[03:03:00.053 --> 03:03:00.434]  That's fine.
[03:03:00.454 --> 03:03:01.454]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[03:03:01.834 --> 03:03:08.296]  And basically, you just did a great contrasting of the way the parties are operating right now in the Democratic election side.
[03:03:08.356 --> 03:03:11.257]  You've got basically your classic dog and pony show going on.
[03:03:11.617 --> 03:03:12.537]  But you know what?
[03:03:12.637 --> 03:03:17.019]  We've got the political version of WrestleMania going on.
[03:03:17.239 --> 03:03:18.859]  And hopefully it's not all show.
[03:03:19.100 --> 03:03:20.160]  And I don't think it is all show.
[03:03:20.300 --> 03:03:26.682]  I think we're seeing some real stuff happen, real truth come out, real New World Order fighting come out.
[03:03:27.344 --> 03:03:28.125]  Right, absolutely.
[03:03:28.185 --> 03:03:41.237]  Just the fact that we had two other Republican candidates expose this backdoor deal there with the delegates, and that probably put it on the radar for the majority of American people going, huh, well how can they swing the election?
[03:03:41.257 --> 03:03:42.378]  I never heard about it.
[03:03:42.458 --> 03:03:43.659]  I thought my vote mattered.
[03:03:44.400 --> 03:03:51.422]  You know, that was a huge blessing that happened that other day because it was last Sunday on all the political talking head shows.
[03:03:51.863 --> 03:03:53.623]  It was all about, what is GOP doing?
[03:03:53.643 --> 03:03:57.665]  They're upset, they're going to talk, they're looking at seeing what they can do in the convention, brokered convention.
[03:03:58.325 --> 03:04:01.666]  How can we make the outcome not be Donald Trump as the nominee?
[03:04:01.986 --> 03:04:09.729]  So yes, it was really a blessing to see all that really blow up on the media last week and hopefully it's not just forgotten and shoved aside.
[03:04:09.969 --> 03:04:10.730]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:12.331]  Well, Richard, what else have you got?
[03:04:12.351 --> 03:04:13.972]  We've got about another minute left or so.
[03:04:14.032 --> 03:04:16.414]  What else are you going to be doing here the rest of the week?
[03:04:16.814 --> 03:04:18.316]  What can we look forward to with your reports?
[03:04:18.816 --> 03:04:26.602]  Well, I am presently trying to get some credentials to get in and livestream and record the Donald Trump event coming up this Saturday.
[03:04:27.203 --> 03:04:31.626]  And I'll be working today and tomorrow also tracking down some other candidates on the road.
[03:04:31.686 --> 03:04:33.107]  And I don't want to tip them off on this show.
[03:04:33.228 --> 03:04:33.648]  I'll be there.
[03:04:33.996 --> 03:04:46.619]  Yeah, well it'll be interesting to see if you can talk to any of those college kids out there that really understand the real threat that this country is facing, and that's this huge spending and tax cut bill that was just passed.
[03:04:46.639 --> 03:04:54.441]  That's the real threat, but all they want to talk about is Walt Disney World putting metal detectors at their theme parks, and the terror threat that's out there.
[03:04:55.041 --> 03:04:57.101]  Now Rob Dew is going to be joining us on the other side.
[03:04:57.161 --> 03:04:58.582]  Richard Reeves, thank you so much.
[03:04:58.602 --> 03:04:59.502]  Thank you, Leah.
[03:04:59.522 --> 03:05:03.263]  And we'll be right back with the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:05:09.434 --> 03:05:11.798]  Hillary Clinton wants to censor people who make fun of her.
[03:05:11.938 --> 03:05:17.767]  She was recently trying to censor comedy skits that poked fun at her, which were produced by the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles, California.
[03:05:17.907 --> 03:05:24.498]  The owner of the Laugh Factory, Jamie Masada, told Judicial Watch that her campaign threatened to put him out of business if he didn't pull the videos.
[03:05:24.718 --> 03:05:33.025]  So in response to this attack on free speech, InfoWars.com has launched the Make Fun of Hillary Defend the First Amendment contest with a first place cash prize of $5,000.

[03:07:09.085 --> 03:07:17.267]  We have been fighting this war tirelessly with you at our side, day in and day out, exposing the ludicrous lies and criminal operations of the globalists.
[03:07:17.427 --> 03:07:19.427]  And we're starting to see big effects.
[03:07:19.747 --> 03:07:21.267]  And the word is getting out.
[03:07:21.627 --> 03:07:23.528]  The globalists want to make us dependent.
[03:07:23.708 --> 03:07:27.088]  And as Napoleon famously said, an army marches on its stomach.
[03:07:27.448 --> 03:07:32.409]  Ammunition, food, and supplies form the backbone of any offensive, including the Info War.
[03:07:32.929 --> 03:07:35.870]  And our enemies admit they're losing the Info War.
[03:07:36.550 --> 03:07:39.714]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[03:07:39.894 --> 03:07:46.181]  With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse any money from globalists or government.
[03:07:46.401 --> 03:07:53.229]  We are funding our crusade against tyranny the old-fashioned way, with pure free-market, free-will capitalism.

[03:08:24.622 --> 03:08:25.984]  We are on the march.
[03:08:26.425 --> 03:08:28.789]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:08:29.590 --> 03:08:32.094]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:37.148 --> 03:08:39.210]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:39.230 --> 03:08:41.052]  This is the 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:08:41.112 --> 03:08:42.052]  I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[03:08:42.093 --> 03:08:50.160]  I'm about to hand over the baton to Rob Dew in the back, but I just wanted to kind of put an exclamation point on my time here with Alex.
[03:08:50.620 --> 03:09:03.232]  Just letting everyone know that, you know, if you turn on CNN right now, I guarantee you they're still going to be talking about this Walt Disney World, putting metal detectors in their theme parks, and how there's no credible terror threat, but everyone should be very, very scared.
[03:09:03.852 --> 03:09:16.361]  Meanwhile, they're not talking about what is the real threat that's happening with our country right now, and that is this huge funding, spending, tax break deal that's trying to be passed in Congress today and tomorrow.
[03:09:16.401 --> 03:09:19.484]  I'm sure Obama and the Senate is going to sign right off on it.
[03:09:20.224 --> 03:09:23.346]  This is a $1.1 trillion omnibus funding bill.
[03:09:23.747 --> 03:09:27.609]  This is going to more than triple the number of H-2B visas, okay?
[03:09:27.649 --> 03:09:30.852]  This is foreign workers who are seeking jobs at hotels.
[03:09:31.252 --> 03:09:36.833]  Theme parks, ski resorts, golf courses, landscaping businesses, restaurants and bars.
[03:09:37.253 --> 03:09:43.854]  So that young college student there that was saying that he wanted to vote for Bernie Sanders, you know, he said he was a bartender, right?
[03:09:43.874 --> 03:09:52.476]  So you're basically voting and handing over your jobs, $1.6 billion to help resettle illegal immigrants here into the country.
[03:09:52.536 --> 03:09:54.896]  And these are the things that they do not want to educate you on.
[03:09:54.936 --> 03:09:57.857]  They clearly do not educate the youth on these things.
[03:09:58.157 --> 03:10:00.357]  Instead, they want you to be worried about a non
[03:10:00.657 --> 03:10:01.578]  We're good to go.
[03:10:21.317 --> 03:10:21.857]  Right, right.
[03:10:21.937 --> 03:10:28.922]  And just listening to you and Alex talk about it earlier, he had a right-hand man and his name was Evan Grebel.
[03:10:29.583 --> 03:10:33.365]  So, I mean, they just sound like, you know... Shkreli and Grebel.
[03:10:33.385 --> 03:10:34.586]  Shkreli and Grebel.
[03:10:34.806 --> 03:10:35.907]  We'll steal your money.
[03:10:35.927 --> 03:10:41.911]  It looks like they're just doing one company that they were running, Retrofin.
[03:10:42.011 --> 03:10:43.612]  They had losses of $11 million.
[03:10:43.632 --> 03:10:47.575]  And then I was reading through this Daily Mail article.
[03:10:48.855 --> 03:10:49.876]  They've been doing this since he was 26.
[03:10:51.477 --> 03:10:52.157]  Is what it looks like.
[03:10:52.257 --> 03:10:57.580]  They have a $2.3 million judgment from Lehman Brothers, which how much millions did Lehman Brothers steal from people?
[03:10:57.600 --> 03:11:04.863]  $700,000 that they lost from MSMB Capital that they had set up, and they ended up owing Merrill Lynch $7 million.
[03:11:05.423 --> 03:11:10.566]  And the reason I point out the numbers that these guys were losing, you know, tens of millions.
[03:11:10.726 --> 03:11:11.626]  Okay, that's a lot of money.
[03:11:12.106 --> 03:11:12.707]  It's a lot of money.
[03:11:13.527 --> 03:11:16.029]  But these guys are probably going to go to prison for a long time.
[03:11:16.329 --> 03:11:19.091]  Let's look over here at MF Global just a couple years ago.
[03:11:19.372 --> 03:11:24.255]  Ordered to repay customers $1.2 billion that they were missing from customers' accounts.
[03:11:24.275 --> 03:11:25.636]  Just gone.
[03:11:25.796 --> 03:11:26.117]  $1.2 billion.
[03:11:26.697 --> 03:11:30.140]  Nothing happens to Don, John Corzine right there.
[03:11:30.200 --> 03:11:31.301]  And then look at this.
[03:11:31.381 --> 03:11:35.964]  Wachovia to settle money laundering case for $160 million.
[03:11:36.425 --> 03:11:38.486]  How much were they laundering?
[03:11:38.846 --> 03:11:41.729]  Oh, just $420 billion in transactions from Mexico.
[03:11:42.389 --> 03:11:46.293]  You know, so billions of dollars is what the big guys do.
[03:11:46.353 --> 03:11:48.275]  These guys are small fries.
[03:11:48.895 --> 03:11:51.398]  And that's the reason they got popped, is because they're not made men.
[03:11:51.418 --> 03:11:52.338]  They're not skull and bones.
[03:11:52.358 --> 03:11:53.459]  They don't have that pedigree.
[03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:54.821]  McAdoo, are you still there?
[03:11:54.841 --> 03:11:55.501]  What do you think of that?
[03:11:55.742 --> 03:12:01.227]  Yeah, I just wonder, who did these guys aggravate that they got taken down, Shkreli and Griebel?
[03:12:01.487 --> 03:12:06.432]  I mean, when you take a look at this, I mean, they must have really pissed off the wrong guy there.
[03:12:06.832 --> 03:12:18.576]  And somebody made a call, who made a call, made a call, because I bet the group that they run around in and the people like them probably thought it was great that they were overcharging or that they raised the price on this AIDS drug that people were using, you know.
[03:12:18.596 --> 03:12:18.796]  Right.
[03:12:19.056 --> 03:12:20.597]  As if that's never happened before.
[03:12:20.857 --> 03:12:21.297]  Exactly.
[03:12:21.337 --> 03:12:21.998]  So it's ridiculous.
[03:12:22.018 --> 03:12:27.399]  And that's really, you know, all I want to say about that is that the reason he got popped is because he's not part of the New World Order.
[03:12:27.439 --> 03:12:31.401]  He's one of these outside minions kind of in the outer rim, to use a Star Wars reference,
[03:12:31.781 --> 03:12:37.707]  Sort of like a bounty hunter using, you know, his own assets and, you know, he got popped because he went against the empire.
[03:12:37.888 --> 03:12:38.148]  Right.
[03:12:38.188 --> 03:12:43.674]  Well, and also he was so, you know, so many people were outraged over him raising the price of those drugs.
[03:12:43.994 --> 03:12:49.380]  And so he was just trending on Twitter, on the top of the news and in every arena.
[03:12:49.400 --> 03:12:53.204]  So, of course, they wanted to show people, oh, look, here's some justice for you.
[03:12:53.604 --> 03:12:54.084]  Right, right.
[03:12:54.104 --> 03:12:58.246]  We're going to give you this guy because you guys want him, but we're not going to give you John Corzine.
[03:12:58.266 --> 03:13:04.829]  We're not going to give you any bankers who destroyed the economy in 2008 with the help of the politicians.
[03:13:05.470 --> 03:13:06.150]  We know how that goes.
[03:13:06.430 --> 03:13:07.991]  Now I want to turn to another story from Daily Mail.
[03:13:08.671 --> 03:13:15.495]  A Florida professor fired for sickening Sandy Hook Hoax Theory after harassing a victim's family over whether their dead son ever existed.
[03:13:16.715 --> 03:13:26.943]  I'm not even going to mention the son's name, the son that they're referring to, because we've gotten letters from this son's dad in the past, and I mean, you mentioned this kid, and this guy freaks out.
[03:13:27.503 --> 03:13:42.694]  And I'll tell you what, the thing that really is the red flag about Sandy Hook, and they talk about whether the victims died or not, is they were running a drill right down the road the same day, and it was about how you're having a mass casualty live shooter event with children.
[03:13:43.334 --> 03:13:43.574]  I think?
[03:14:01.690 --> 03:14:01.890]  I don't
[03:14:32.270 --> 03:14:33.451]  It's definitely a false flag.
[03:14:33.971 --> 03:14:35.492]  So, we'll leave that there.
[03:14:35.733 --> 03:14:47.040]  Now, getting to Star Wars, Alex was asking us to locate a video he did back in 2005, and apparently the internet just can't keep up with the amount of video that Alex puts out.
[03:14:48.354 --> 03:14:49.455]  And we haven't been able to find it.
[03:14:49.475 --> 03:14:54.879]  We found an article that he wrote about it, about episode 3 when it came out and how it relates to false flag terror.
[03:14:55.319 --> 03:15:03.145]  But just last year, when they put out the first Force Awakens trailer, I did a report basically honchoed by Alex.
[03:15:03.325 --> 03:15:04.266]  He helped me with the outline.
[03:15:04.286 --> 03:15:06.607]  He goes, just do a report on how it's all false flag.
[03:15:06.647 --> 03:15:07.668]  Episode 3 is false flag.
[03:15:07.708 --> 03:15:12.531]  So here's an excerpt from that report and then I'll tell you where you can see the whole thing when we get back.
[03:15:13.032 --> 03:15:16.114]  To ensure the security and continuing stability
[03:15:18.051 --> 03:15:25.415]  The Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire!
[03:15:25.515 --> 03:15:32.178]  For a safe and secure society!
[03:15:34.565 --> 03:15:41.672]  Emperor Palpatine, or the emperors he is referred to by the time he was thrown down a reactor shaft, started off as a mild-mannered senator from Naboo.
[03:15:42.192 --> 03:15:47.798]  He then hatched a multi-decade plan using many different alien races as his useful ID10Ts.
[03:15:48.498 --> 03:15:51.281]  That's idiots for all you out there who don't speak nerd.
[03:15:51.822 --> 03:15:53.643]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[03:15:53.663 --> 03:15:55.145]  These aren't the droids.
[03:15:56.789 --> 03:16:02.375]  He secretly initiates the creation of two armies, manages to get elected Chancellor under the guise of a humanitarian crisis.
[03:16:02.635 --> 03:16:04.997]  I first act with this new authority.
[03:16:06.548 --> 03:16:13.870]  I will create a grand army of the Republic to counter the increasing threats of the Separatists.
[03:16:13.890 --> 03:16:27.673]  Then starts a war where both sides of the conflict have unlimited budgets to fight a war on hundreds of battlefronts, thereby draining the resources of all sides, and doing this under the nose of the Jedi, who just can't seem to realize that the guy walking and talking with them is a Sith Lord.
[03:16:29.293 --> 03:16:32.214]  The dark side clouds everything.
[03:16:33.502 --> 03:16:36.565]  The Emperor even manages to off all of his commanders.
[03:16:40.928 --> 03:16:49.575]  And convinces his new apprentice, Darth Bad Acting, to kill all the remaining leaders of his confederacy, so he is then the only person with total knowledge of his master plan.
[03:16:49.976 --> 03:16:52.478]  He will take care of you.
[03:16:53.379 --> 03:16:56.741]  Lord Sidious promised us peace.
[03:16:56.781 --> 03:16:57.462]  He only wants...
[03:16:58.669 --> 03:17:01.770]  Look up the Knight of the Long Knives if you want a historical example for that one.
[03:17:02.390 --> 03:17:07.712]  Fast forward 18 years, the Supreme Chancellor disbands his dysfunctional government in favor of a dictatorship.
[03:17:08.413 --> 03:17:12.094]  I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the Council permanently.
[03:17:12.554 --> 03:17:18.656]  Thus completing a galaxy-wide false flag which started off as a seemingly small planetary trade blockade on his home planet.
[03:17:19.917 --> 03:17:26.019]  So by playing off all sides against each other and creating a crisis, which is the Confederacy with a giant drone army,
[03:17:27.079 --> 03:17:32.481]  He is able to pull off the Hegelian dialectic by providing his own convenient clone army, which he started creating years ago.
[03:17:33.201 --> 03:17:36.202]  Emperor Palpatine is the perfect technocrat dictator.
[03:17:37.463 --> 03:17:39.383]  It's treason, Ben.
[03:17:42.324 --> 03:17:52.388]  And that was definitely one of the best installments of the trilogy, the third one, just showing you how that whole plan, you know, kind of assumed itself at the end.
[03:17:52.728 --> 03:17:55.229]  Leanne, are you a big Star Wars fan?
[03:17:55.249 --> 03:17:55.769]  I don't even know.
[03:17:56.958 --> 03:17:58.967]  I am not.
[03:17:59.028 --> 03:18:00.515]  I'm sorry everyone out there, I'm just not.
[03:18:02.318 --> 03:18:09.383]  Well, you know, there is a lot of hype around it and it is a big news event just with all the lockdowns they're doing.
[03:18:09.403 --> 03:18:10.223]  They're searching people.
[03:18:10.263 --> 03:18:13.545]  There's a Twitter picture of Chewbacca being searched.
[03:18:14.146 --> 03:18:17.848]  They're not allowing people to wear makeup, bring in lightsabers or guns.
[03:18:17.948 --> 03:18:25.533]  I mean, they're just basically trying to say, here, we're going to pipe this thing up so much to make you want to go see it and get into it, but you can't really get into it.
[03:18:25.573 --> 03:18:26.334]  You kind of have to just
[03:18:27.054 --> 03:18:27.494]  We're good to go.
[03:18:41.451 --> 03:18:42.272]  Don't do anything about it.
[03:18:42.572 --> 03:18:42.972]  Exactly.
[03:18:43.012 --> 03:18:45.434]  Don't act it out and be lured by that.
[03:18:45.534 --> 03:18:48.195]  So that's really all I wanted to say about that.
[03:18:48.215 --> 03:18:51.598]  We're going to try to locate that video of Alex's breakdown of it from 2005.
[03:18:52.018 --> 03:18:58.102]  And I found a Windows Media link that was dead and a QuickTime link that was dead.
[03:18:58.242 --> 03:19:02.285]  And I was surprised I didn't find a RealPlayer link, but I guess RealPlayer had already bitten the dust by then.
[03:19:04.526 --> 03:19:09.891]  Anyway, Leanne, thanks for joining me, and thanks for passing the baton off, and we will talk to you later.
[03:19:09.911 --> 03:19:10.891]  Have a good one.
[03:19:10.951 --> 03:19:11.332]  Bye!
[03:19:11.552 --> 03:19:11.772]  Bye.
[03:19:12.132 --> 03:19:14.935]  So, going to Hillary Clinton.
[03:19:14.995 --> 03:19:23.202]  There's a video that surfaced of, I guess she's at a town hall meeting, and a guy asks her, are you going to take money from fossil fuel companies?
[03:19:23.222 --> 03:19:25.583]  Because they're suddenly the worst thing in the world.
[03:19:26.144 --> 03:19:27.845]  And she claims she has dementia.
[03:19:27.885 --> 03:19:28.706]  She has donor dementia.
[03:19:28.726 --> 03:19:29.407]  She doesn't know.
[03:19:29.827 --> 03:19:32.209]  So let's roll that clip, and then we'll come back and talk about it.
[03:19:34.076 --> 03:19:38.880]  Have both committed to not take money from the fossil fuel industry.
[03:19:39.781 --> 03:19:48.148]  I'd like to know if you'd be willing to sign a pledge that you will not take money from the fossil fuel industry, and you'll stop immediately.
[03:19:50.504 --> 03:19:51.885]  Well, I don't know that I ever have.
[03:19:52.165 --> 03:19:53.485]  I'm not exactly one of their favorites.
[03:19:53.525 --> 03:19:53.905]  You have.
[03:19:55.106 --> 03:19:55.866]  I'll check.
[03:19:55.926 --> 03:20:00.128]  He certainly hasn't made much of an impression on me.
[03:20:00.268 --> 03:20:00.808]  There you go.
[03:20:00.908 --> 03:20:08.752]  Didn't make much of an impression on her and I'll have some comments on that when I get back and maybe a real tower plot that could be being hatched by ISIS in this very moment.
[03:20:09.864 --> 03:20:13.187]  We've had an amazing year here at Supernatural Silver.

[03:22:32.551 --> 03:22:42.338]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:22:42.578 --> 03:22:48.842]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:22:49.082 --> 03:22:52.384]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:22:52.404 --> 03:22:54.246]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:22:54.486 --> 03:22:57.568]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:22:57.608 --> 03:23:00.651]  Winter has just begun and are you already tired of being cold?

[03:24:19.261 --> 03:24:24.805]  Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth Vader.
[03:24:25.146 --> 03:24:25.646]  That's right.
[03:24:25.866 --> 03:24:27.848]  Star Wars mania has taken over the country.
[03:24:28.088 --> 03:24:32.031]  And with that, we have Stormtrooper-like activity at all locations of the show.
[03:24:32.071 --> 03:24:38.255]  And some people getting their bags searched, not allowed to bring fake toy guns or lightsabers or dress up in makeup or masks.
[03:24:39.076 --> 03:24:40.497]  Because that's the country we live in now.
[03:24:40.537 --> 03:24:40.718]  Why?
[03:24:40.778 --> 03:24:55.472]  Because a small band of ragtag rebels in a dusty planet on the other side of the world, a dusty area, have basically stolen the plans to the Death Star and they're now in the process of trying to destroy Western civilization.
[03:24:56.133 --> 03:24:57.054]  That's right, that's ISIS.
[03:24:58.168 --> 03:24:59.649]  But they may be here in the United States.
[03:24:59.789 --> 03:25:04.052]  In fact, here's an article from the Washington Post, I believe this is.
[03:25:04.072 --> 03:25:08.134]  It said, ISIS sign held during Ferguson March confuses CNN viewers.
[03:25:08.194 --> 03:25:11.056]  And it's a picture, you guys can maybe zoom in on it right here.
[03:25:11.076 --> 03:25:12.797]  I think it's Jake Tapper.
[03:25:13.197 --> 03:25:16.779]  And behind him there's a guy that says, ISIS here, is what he's got.
[03:25:17.320 --> 03:25:19.741]  And actually we had a report from Joe Biggs this morning.
[03:25:19.781 --> 03:25:23.444]  There's a bunch of alerts going out around Missouri.
[03:25:24.424 --> 03:25:27.788]  People getting cell phones, stealing propane tanks, and asking about dams.
[03:25:28.428 --> 03:25:31.592]  So here's Joe Biggs with that report, and then I'll come back and show you the articles that go along with it.
[03:25:33.112 --> 03:25:35.293]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[03:25:35.333 --> 03:25:40.934]  Now, we have been investigating the American Caliphate that has been unfolding before our eyes.
[03:25:40.994 --> 03:25:45.355]  And now we have some really suspicious activity that is happening in Missouri.
[03:25:45.735 --> 03:25:55.037]  Now, not too long ago, a bulk amount of cell phones that are prepaid were purchased in a number of different areas throughout Missouri at Walmart locations.
[03:25:55.777 --> 03:25:58.578]  Columbia, Jefferson City, Lebanon, and Macon.
[03:25:58.918 --> 03:26:01.738]  Now in two cases the FBI was contacted.
[03:26:01.778 --> 03:26:06.399]  I know in one of the locations 60 prepaid cell phones were purchased.
[03:26:06.840 --> 03:26:11.160]  Now law enforcement agencies reported cell phones are potential tools in the hands of terrorists.
[03:26:11.300 --> 03:26:13.001]  One, because prepaid they can't be traced.
[03:26:14.081 --> 03:26:16.582]  Two, they can be used as detonators for bombs.
[03:26:17.162 --> 03:26:22.083]  So now we have another part of this puzzle that is a here you have this
[03:26:23.908 --> 03:26:24.309]  Right here.
[03:26:24.769 --> 03:26:28.193]  Dozens of propane tanks stolen from three different Metro locations.
[03:26:28.533 --> 03:26:30.675]  Now this is all being reported by local news.
[03:26:31.436 --> 03:26:32.898]  This is Kansas City, Missouri.
[03:26:32.998 --> 03:26:33.519]  This is a...
[03:26:34.881 --> 03:26:39.484]  Another incident has some people wondering if we are in danger of a terrorist attack in our area.
[03:26:40.004 --> 03:26:46.588]  A large number of propane tanks have been reported stolen from several locations in Independence and Lee's Summit.
[03:26:47.188 --> 03:26:48.308]  Now we have this today.
[03:26:48.348 --> 03:26:50.730]  The FBI once again has been alerted.
[03:26:50.770 --> 03:26:52.451]  This is also from a local news source.
[03:26:52.991 --> 03:26:55.813]  FBI alerted about a group of men asking about the Bagnell Dam.
[03:26:56.727 --> 03:27:01.910]  It says police are revealing more about a report of a group of men asking about the Bagnell Dam.
[03:27:02.590 --> 03:27:05.271]  Miller County Sheriff Bill Abbott tells Late News.
[03:27:05.832 --> 03:27:10.194]  Now it says the incident happened about two weeks ago at the Golden Corral in Assaj Beach.
[03:27:10.494 --> 03:27:14.036]  A deputy was eating lunch and the waitstaff told him about the group of men.
[03:27:14.136 --> 03:27:21.080]  Staffers said that the men were asking questions about the dam and they wanted to know if they could rent a boat and tour the dam.
[03:27:21.980 --> 03:27:32.248]  Now, I don't know if you guys remember when Jakari Jackson and I were in Ferguson, Missouri, this sign was spotted all over CNN as Jake Tapper was reporting live, ISIS is here.
[03:27:32.809 --> 03:27:38.313]  So that leaves the question, is ISIS in Missouri and are they planning an attack?
[03:27:38.894 --> 03:27:46.039]  I want to encourage each and every one of you who live in that Missouri area, if you know of any local reports of any more suspicious things that are popping up, purchases,
[03:27:47.020 --> 03:27:47.861]  Things of that nature.
[03:27:48.201 --> 03:27:52.425]  Send that information to us and we can compile more and update our report.
[03:27:52.725 --> 03:27:55.447]  So stay tuned for more reports at InfoWars.com.
[03:27:55.467 --> 03:27:56.348]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[03:27:58.129 --> 03:28:05.555]  And what the racist Joe Biggs did not say, and I'm just going to go ahead and be the racist and say it, FBI alerted about a group of men asking about Bagnell Dam.
[03:28:05.575 --> 03:28:06.076]  You go down there.
[03:28:06.476 --> 03:28:10.199]  The sheriff said they received a tip about a group of Middle Eastern men asking about the Bagnell Dam.
[03:28:12.236 --> 03:28:16.459]  The waitstaff told the sheriff, hey, Middle Eastern men, we're asking about this dam.
[03:28:16.659 --> 03:28:20.382]  Now there's stolen cell, or bought cell phones, stolen propane tanks.
[03:28:21.123 --> 03:28:22.283]  Could be something, could be nothing.
[03:28:22.363 --> 03:28:22.724]  Who knows?
[03:28:23.604 --> 03:28:24.345]  It could also be this.
[03:28:24.405 --> 03:28:27.607]  They're telling the FBI, this could all be being run by an FBI informant.
[03:28:27.908 --> 03:28:29.329]  And I'll take you to an article
[03:28:29.949 --> 03:28:31.929]  From the New York Times from April 28, 2012.
[03:28:32.129 --> 03:28:34.410]  It's up here on the screen, guys.
[03:28:34.730 --> 03:28:36.930]  Terrorist plots hatched by the FBI.
[03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:41.431]  And it talks about a series of plots that were being run by FBI informants.
[03:28:42.051 --> 03:28:50.552]  And the FBI informant was getting the people together, getting the money together, getting the bombs together in some cases, or getting the guns or whatever, and getting everybody together and then they come get arrested.
[03:28:50.853 --> 03:28:54.553]  So the FBI was setting up dozens of people in these plots.
[03:28:54.893 --> 03:28:56.413]  So this could be another case of that.
[03:28:56.734 --> 03:28:59.394]  But we have local law enforcement working with them and they're probably
[03:28:59.694 --> 03:29:02.115]  Not in on any such plot if it were to exist.
[03:29:03.395 --> 03:29:05.176]  So they could stop it in that case.
[03:29:05.196 --> 03:29:08.156]  But if the FBI is left to their devices, sometimes they do do these things.
[03:29:08.337 --> 03:29:10.017]  And I am definitely not a fan of that.
[03:29:10.297 --> 03:29:11.237]  But what does this go to?
[03:29:11.297 --> 03:29:17.819]  This leads, and we still got a little bit of time here, Progressive Media argues, thanks to ISIS, we have to consider limits on free speech.
[03:29:18.199 --> 03:29:19.860]  And this is a tweet that came from Slate.
[03:29:20.640 --> 03:29:23.202]  Thanks to ISIS, we have to consider limits on free speech.
[03:29:23.242 --> 03:29:26.945]  They sent this out on the 15th and people are responding, that'll show them.
[03:29:27.585 --> 03:29:29.847]  ISIS would like that, wouldn't ISIS?
[03:29:30.547 --> 03:29:33.309]  Wait a minute, that's exactly what ISIS wants us to do.
[03:29:33.489 --> 03:29:34.290]  I thought that was bad.
[03:29:34.310 --> 03:29:35.551]  It was last week.
[03:29:37.112 --> 03:29:38.773]  How did your generation handle the terrorist threat?
[03:29:38.853 --> 03:29:40.715]  Oh, we stripped away civil liberties of our citizens.
[03:29:41.796 --> 03:29:43.297]  And there's some other ones that have
[03:29:44.881 --> 03:29:46.183]  Words that we can't say on the radio.
[03:29:46.643 --> 03:29:47.464]  So check that article out.
[03:29:47.484 --> 03:29:48.385]  It's at Infowars.com.
[03:29:48.405 --> 03:29:49.186]  I'm your host, Rob Dew.
[03:29:49.206 --> 03:29:50.147]  This is the 4th Hour.
[03:29:50.227 --> 03:29:50.648]  Stay tuned.
[03:29:58.837 --> 03:29:59.718]  We're on the march.
[03:30:00.219 --> 03:30:01.821]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.762 --> 03:30:05.445]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.577 --> 03:30:12.179]  A Middle Eastern woman was caught surveilling a U.S.
[03:30:12.239 --> 03:30:18.924]  port of entry on the Mexican border, holding a sketchbook with Arabic writing and drawings of the facility and its security system.
[03:30:19.224 --> 03:30:26.569]  The woman has been identified as 23-year-old Leila Abdel-Razak, according to a Customs and Border Patrol report obtained by Judicial Watch.
[03:30:26.829 --> 03:30:32.871]  When federal officers asked her why she was drawing sketches of the facility, she stated, because she's never been to the border.
[03:30:33.051 --> 03:30:36.293]  This comes on the heels of two separate incidents in the same vicinity.
[03:30:36.593 --> 03:30:41.595]  A few weeks ago, Judicial Watch reported that five young Middle Eastern men were apprehended by the U.S.
[03:30:41.635 --> 03:30:42.195]  Border Patrol.
[03:30:42.495 --> 03:30:49.521]  In Amado, an Arizona town about 30 miles from the Mexican border, two of the men were carrying stainless steel cylinders in backpacks.
[03:30:50.001 --> 03:30:57.867]  A week earlier, six men, one from Afghanistan and five from Pakistan, were arrested in a town that sits 20 miles north of the Mexican border.
[03:30:58.167 --> 03:31:04.713]  Meanwhile, the feds have repeatedly downplayed or ignored Islamic terror threats to focus on right-wing radicals.
[03:31:05.253 --> 03:31:07.495]  Leigh-Anne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:31:09.301 --> 03:31:12.503]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:12.803 --> 03:31:20.809]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:31:21.049 --> 03:31:26.073]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:31:26.473 --> 03:31:28.775]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[03:31:43.714 --> 03:31:47.677]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[03:32:04.009 --> 03:32:06.231]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:32:09.033 --> 03:32:15.857]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[03:32:15.937 --> 03:32:18.638]  We've always offered five months free.
[03:32:18.838 --> 03:32:24.421]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[03:32:24.761 --> 03:32:27.863]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[03:32:28.123 --> 03:32:31.145]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.

[03:33:21.377 --> 03:33:30.460]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:34.082 --> 03:33:36.583]  We are live halfway through the fourth hour today.
[03:33:36.603 --> 03:33:40.224]  It's Thursday, December 17th.
[03:33:40.284 --> 03:33:40.684]  My gosh.
[03:33:41.044 --> 03:33:42.085]  Year's almost over.
[03:33:42.915 --> 03:33:43.736]  I'm your host Rob Dew.
[03:33:44.156 --> 03:33:44.976]  Thanks for watching.
[03:33:45.036 --> 03:33:51.021]  You can watch the televised version of this at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:33:51.301 --> 03:33:58.266]  Now coming up we're going to premiere a video that if you are on Facebook and get Alex's Facebook mentions, which you can pull that up.
[03:33:58.806 --> 03:34:02.147]  Right there, yeah, you can see the report that we put out yesterday.
[03:34:02.367 --> 03:34:08.070]  This was a one-take report that Alex did on Facebook Mentions and we were also shooting HD video live.
[03:34:08.090 --> 03:34:12.151]  I'm just going to play that so you can kind of see how it was just one camera set up on the cell phone.
[03:34:12.271 --> 03:34:21.375]  We're going to have multiple cameras along with video clips and articles all in HD that we're going to premiere coming up here for the rest of the show pretty much.
[03:34:21.395 --> 03:34:24.356]  We're going to be skipping the network break so you can watch the whole thing.
[03:34:24.496 --> 03:34:25.517]  I'll tell you where you can find it.
[03:34:26.477 --> 03:34:28.018]  Actually, you'll be able to find it after this.
[03:34:28.038 --> 03:34:29.059]  I'm going to put it up on YouTube.
[03:34:29.599 --> 03:34:30.539]  It is not up yet.
[03:34:30.579 --> 03:34:43.087]  So this will be the world premiere of Alex Jones showing the Bush-Nazi connection and how it started and what it means today and why people like Jeb Bush are so incredibly just like snidely.
[03:34:43.127 --> 03:34:46.929]  They don't care that Jeb Bush doesn't care that he's three percent in the polls because
[03:34:47.489 --> 03:34:53.194]  As we're going to show you on the Infowars Nightly News tonight with Darren McBreen, I did an interview yesterday with a witness.
[03:34:53.335 --> 03:34:59.420]  This is just an entrepreneur guy who's at a networking event, and he started getting the Jeb Bush spiel from a delegate in North Carolina.
[03:34:59.901 --> 03:35:01.662]  And they're like, no, we're for Rand Paul.
[03:35:01.682 --> 03:35:03.384]  And he goes, you're stupid.
[03:35:03.704 --> 03:35:04.965]  Jeb's got this thing locked up.
[03:35:05.065 --> 03:35:06.065]  I've already pledged to Jeb.
[03:35:06.105 --> 03:35:07.386]  It doesn't matter what the vote is.
[03:35:07.526 --> 03:35:08.287]  I'm voting for Jeb.
[03:35:08.547 --> 03:35:09.708]  And that's where the power is.
[03:35:09.988 --> 03:35:23.195]  Just like we showed you last week with Richard Reeves, the delegate strategy, we have to get our people, freedom-minded people, in the delegate strategy to point out when this stuff goes on, and also to not put people like Jeb Bush in.
[03:35:23.636 --> 03:35:32.341]  But before we get to that Bush-Nazi connection, world premiere video that we're going to show you here on TheInfoWars.com, Alex Jones Radio Show, fourth hour,
[03:35:32.981 --> 03:35:37.745]  We've only got one day left to give the gift of total health with this spectacular deal.
[03:35:37.785 --> 03:35:38.866]  That's right, only one day left.
[03:35:39.026 --> 03:35:40.407]  And we also have free shipping.
[03:35:40.767 --> 03:35:41.428]  So here we go.

[03:36:32.093 --> 03:36:34.215]  And it's not something that can be censored, which we've seen.
[03:36:34.235 --> 03:36:36.237]  We've had some of our videos pulled down off of YouTube.
[03:36:36.537 --> 03:36:40.601]  We've pulled down some of our videos just because we've been threatened to be sued.
[03:36:40.981 --> 03:36:42.542]  So we have to do this from time to time.
[03:36:42.562 --> 03:36:46.366]  That's why it's essential to become a member of Prison Planet TV, to keep that going.
[03:36:47.126 --> 03:36:51.789]  And also, oh yeah, the Infowars solar base station, the power supply.
[03:36:52.049 --> 03:36:54.950]  It's got a solar panel, it's got a battery, a bunch of other accessories.
[03:36:55.731 --> 03:36:58.672]  We have a video, I think, Power Your Life with the Sun.
[03:36:59.453 --> 03:37:01.354]  That's a video that's out there on YouTube right now.
[03:37:01.494 --> 03:37:04.175]  Our engineer CJ talking about the power station.
[03:37:04.195 --> 03:37:06.336]  He's kind of an aficionado of solar power.
[03:37:06.616 --> 03:37:12.840]  And with that, we're going to go to the world premiere of Alex Jones decoding the Bush-Nazi connection.
[03:37:13.826 --> 03:37:18.591]  My friends, this is a very special edition of InfoWars Facebook Mentions.
[03:37:19.231 --> 03:37:33.284]  We are going live right now at 2.49 Central Standard Time here in Austin, Texas and then transmitting worldwide on the 16th day of December 2015 on this Wednesday edition.
[03:37:34.986 --> 03:37:48.129]  Now we're also shooting an HD in here so that tomorrow we can have a more produced piece with added evidence that will premiere on the InfoWars and Nightly News 7 o'clock central on the 17th of December.
[03:37:48.369 --> 03:37:49.969]  So that's tomorrow, that's Thursday.
[03:37:50.009 --> 03:37:52.189]  But we're talking to our millions of viewers.
[03:37:52.609 --> 03:38:00.271]  Average video gets over 500,000 views on Facebook Mentions right now with breaking news because there's been some new developments.
[03:38:01.209 --> 03:38:10.196]  Now, you see the title of this video, obviously, dealing with the fact that there's an investigation to the Bush family and Jeb Bush to the Nazis.
[03:38:11.037 --> 03:38:19.184]  Now, I was one of the people that was involved in breaking this and popularizing it back in 2003 and 2004, and I'm about to show you those articles and more.
[03:38:23.834 --> 03:38:30.437]  But it's important to understand that the Bushes aren't this little sweetsy, cutesy family that you've been told they are.
[03:38:30.877 --> 03:38:45.464]  George Herbert Walker Bush is the son of Prescott Bush, who in congressional hearings, the McCormick-Dickstein committee hearings, that were sealed and then declassified just a few decades ago, and basically buried, they were the head Nazi
[03:38:47.592 --> 03:38:52.716]  Lawyers, not just for the U.S., but for Latin America and major Nazi shipping firms.
[03:38:53.636 --> 03:39:03.803]  And when the Nazis collapsed in 1945, they helped get the Nazis, 36,000 of them in the Rat Line, Operation Paperclip, out of Germany, Italy, and other areas.
[03:39:04.443 --> 03:39:09.787]  Now, this was known, but only by people like Smedley Butler, who testified secretly to Congress.
[03:39:10.287 --> 03:39:16.792]  This didn't come out again until the 80s, but it was in no publications, because no one dared go to the declassified documents.
[03:39:17.592 --> 03:39:28.476]  That's until people like John Buchanan for the New Hampshire Gazette came out in October 10, 2003.
[03:39:28.856 --> 03:39:30.636]  Bush-Nazi-Link confirmed.
[03:39:31.777 --> 03:39:33.617]  Then, he came out in November.
[03:39:33.717 --> 03:39:35.778]  Bush-Nazi-Link continued.
[03:39:37.276 --> 03:39:52.569]  If you move on from that point with those articles, you then see a year later, September 2004, the London Guardian with the headline, How Bush's Grandfather Helped Hitler Rise to Power.
[03:39:53.610 --> 03:39:57.033]  Notice, it's broken by Infowars, via the Gazette.
[03:39:57.053 --> 03:39:59.295]  We had him on within days of this coming out.
[03:40:00.376 --> 03:40:05.240]  Some of the publishers over at some of the Patriot publishing houses had also put out
[03:40:06.488 --> 03:40:08.510]  Books along this line exposing it.
[03:40:08.650 --> 03:40:12.053]  It had come out in some other congressional hearings as well.
[03:40:12.093 --> 03:40:14.835]  But we're about to get into the full depth of all of this.
[03:40:14.855 --> 03:40:16.817]  There's another Guardian article from July of 2015.
[03:40:16.857 --> 03:40:19.739]  This was also in hundreds of other publications.
[03:40:20.160 --> 03:40:25.504]  Queen's Nazi salute footage raises pressure on Royals to open archives.
[03:40:25.884 --> 03:40:27.586]  Type in British Royals with Nazis.
[03:40:27.926 --> 03:40:31.969]  You'll get hundreds of them with the King of England, her uncle, with their families.
[03:40:32.410 --> 03:40:33.251]  They were German.
[03:40:34.111 --> 03:40:39.574]  Well, really, actually, Romanian or Hungarian, they're actually Transylvanian, they're not even German, who are the House of Windsor.
[03:40:39.614 --> 03:40:40.514]  Windsor's a fake name.
[03:40:40.794 --> 03:40:42.055]  They are Gothas.
[03:40:42.615 --> 03:40:44.676]  Saxe-Coburg Gothas.
[03:40:45.556 --> 03:40:55.981]  And are directly related to their original lineage of Vlad the Impaler, or the original person, the legend of Dracula, the Drac, the dragon, comes from.
[03:40:56.061 --> 03:41:00.243]  You cannot make this level of stuff up.
[03:41:01.127 --> 03:41:05.903]  Now, before I get into the info that's in the committee hearings and that's in the research...
[03:41:07.000 --> 03:41:07.740]  Here's a headline.
[03:41:07.820 --> 03:41:15.805]  Trump exposed how Bush family, in last night's debate on the 15th, Trump exposed how Bush family helped Bin Laden's escape after 9-11.
[03:41:15.845 --> 03:41:20.547]  While all air traffic grounded after 9-11, then President Bush flew Bin Laden family out of the country.
[03:41:21.188 --> 03:41:32.074]  When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back for the most part to Saudi Arabia.
[03:41:32.534 --> 03:41:33.594]  They knew what was going on.
[03:41:33.855 --> 03:41:36.396]  They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends
[03:41:37.497 --> 03:41:41.259]  They were having breakfast that day at the Carlisle Group in D.C., Bush Sr.
[03:41:41.540 --> 03:41:45.322]  and the head of the Bin Laden family at that table, out of a thousand people there.
[03:41:46.023 --> 03:41:49.806]  They are deeply involved, so this shows how they are literally like James Bond criminals.
[03:41:49.846 --> 03:41:52.247]  Now, Jeb Bush has been connected to all sorts of evil.
[03:41:53.168 --> 03:41:54.969]  Zapata oil to narcotics trafficking.
[03:41:55.770 --> 03:41:59.753]  Again, his dad was made the CIA director, supposedly when he'd never been in the CIA.
[03:42:00.814 --> 03:42:03.616]  He, of course, is part of Skull and Bones, itself a German death cult.
[03:42:05.000 --> 03:42:08.242]  I'm not saying that this is a German death cult we're facing.
[03:42:08.322 --> 03:42:11.605]  I'm not saying there's a Germanic, satanic conspiracy that we face.
[03:42:12.045 --> 03:42:15.147]  I'm showing where this particular crime family comes from.
[03:42:15.828 --> 03:42:25.594]  I've snuck into Bohemian Grove, I've covered Skull and Bones, I've interviewed all the experts, I've been on Brad Metzler's shows, I've been all over History Channel, Discovery Channel, True TV, interviewed on this.
[03:42:25.754 --> 03:42:27.456]  I am a leading expert.
[03:42:27.536 --> 03:42:33.200]  I have four shows on Discovery and History right now interviewing me on Secret Societies and Elites, okay?
[03:42:33.880 --> 03:42:37.002]  So, I've done my research, I've made the films, I've been there, I've done it.
[03:42:37.162 --> 03:42:45.205]  I'm not bragging to the folks on Facebook Mentions, I'm not bragging to the folks that are watching this tomorrow night on the nightly news, but Facebook Mentions gets the first live sneak peek.
[03:42:47.286 --> 03:42:50.188]  I am going over all this, you need to understand, this is not my opinion.
[03:42:50.728 --> 03:42:51.749]  Now, here's the rest of the story.
[03:42:53.309 --> 03:42:54.130]  We know that they were the
[03:42:55.157 --> 03:42:55.958]  We're good to go.
[03:43:13.615 --> 03:43:18.196]  I mean, we're talking huge global shipping concerns, oil companies.
[03:43:18.996 --> 03:43:22.817]  And then, you wonder why the Nazis were allowed to flee, not to Russia, but to the U.S.
[03:43:22.857 --> 03:43:23.517]  and Latin America.
[03:43:23.757 --> 03:43:30.239]  The Bushes were considered too big to fail, even though they tried to hire Smedley Butler.
[03:43:30.259 --> 03:43:31.999]  This came out in congressional hearings.
[03:43:32.119 --> 03:43:32.599]  Read about it.
[03:43:33.260 --> 03:43:38.721]  To overthrow the government with a 500,000 man force, for the Nazis basically, install a fascist dictator.
[03:43:39.889 --> 03:43:41.350]  That's why Hitler didn't take America seriously.
[03:43:41.770 --> 03:43:45.132]  When they finally got busted, they thought, this will hurt America too bad if it comes out.
[03:43:45.512 --> 03:43:47.853]  We'll make the Bushes be double agents against the Nazis.
[03:43:48.194 --> 03:43:50.255]  We'll make the Brown Brother Harrimans be double agents.
[03:43:51.375 --> 03:43:52.976]  And we'll make the Kennedys.
[03:43:53.016 --> 03:43:54.917]  We're also all Nazi agents.
[03:43:54.937 --> 03:43:55.758]  That's on Discovery Channel.
[03:43:56.558 --> 03:43:57.178]  That's known.
[03:43:57.258 --> 03:43:57.999]  This isn't known.
[03:43:58.419 --> 03:44:02.100]  That JFK, his brother, they weren't bad guys.
[03:44:02.120 --> 03:44:05.721]  They got infiltrated by sex operatives, beautiful German women.
[03:44:06.422 --> 03:44:07.922]  They thought the Germans were going to take over.
[03:44:07.982 --> 03:44:08.543]  They didn't know.
[03:44:08.583 --> 03:44:11.404]  This was in the 30s before Hitler was a bad guy in the public.
[03:44:11.464 --> 03:44:13.064]  He was a good guy in Time Magazine.
[03:44:13.304 --> 03:44:14.625]  Some might say the Kennedys were overall bad.
[03:44:15.045 --> 03:44:17.326]  They weren't actual lawyers for the Nazis.
[03:44:17.926 --> 03:44:19.847]  They were just fans of it at a certain level.
[03:44:20.647 --> 03:44:23.248]  His father was, Joe Kennedy Sr.
[03:44:24.764 --> 03:44:31.793]  And so they were both, in fact we can put articles up about that once we put a more produced piece out showing you all these other points I'm making because it's just fascinating.
[03:44:33.294 --> 03:44:35.715]  The Bushes, though, were actually at the top of the pyramid.
[03:44:36.076 --> 03:44:41.359]  They weren't under the control of sex operatives and, you know, Joe Kennedy getting letters from Hitler and doing some business with him.
[03:44:41.399 --> 03:44:52.225]  This was hardcore, kind of like George Soros was a Nazi collaborator helping round up Jews and ferret them out and infiltrate synagogues in Hungary and Romania and other areas to round them up.
[03:44:52.305 --> 03:44:53.446]  I mean, that's true as well.
[03:44:53.926 --> 03:44:56.708]  It was actually probably the happiest year of my life.
[03:44:57.548 --> 03:44:59.711]  That year of German occupation.
[03:44:59.791 --> 03:45:01.853]  For me it was a very positive experience.
[03:45:01.933 --> 03:45:11.202]  It's a strange thing because you see incredible suffering around you and in fact you are in considerable danger yourself.
[03:45:12.243 --> 03:45:14.746]  But you're 14 years old and you don't believe.
[03:45:15.641 --> 03:45:17.764]  That it can actually touch you.
[03:45:17.824 --> 03:45:20.927]  You have a belief in yourself, your belief in your father.
[03:45:21.488 --> 03:45:25.352]  It's a very happy-making, exhilarating experience.
[03:45:25.792 --> 03:45:33.721]  So the leftists are controlled by a Nazi collaborator, and the family that says they've got the delegates and don't care if Donald Trump or Rand Paul or Ted Cruz get them...
[03:45:34.582 --> 03:45:36.564]  Donald Trump has, you know, talked about this.
[03:45:37.324 --> 03:45:40.507]  Jeb Bush has told CNN and others, I am not going to let Trump do this.
[03:45:40.567 --> 03:45:43.109]  He will not get the nomination, even if he gets the votes.
[03:45:43.169 --> 03:45:46.012]  We can show you those quotes and clips from CNN.
[03:45:46.132 --> 03:45:47.313]  You're a tough guy, Jeb.
[03:45:47.453 --> 03:45:49.795]  And we need to have a leader that is progressive.
[03:45:49.895 --> 03:45:53.318]  You're never going to be President of the United States by insulting your way to the presidency.
[03:45:53.358 --> 03:45:56.020]  Let's see, I'm at 42 and you're at 3, so so far I'm doing better.
[03:45:56.040 --> 03:45:56.501]  Doesn't matter.
[03:45:56.821 --> 03:45:57.882]  So far I'm doing better.
[03:45:57.982 --> 03:46:03.246]  He talks about the border, and I saw it, and I was witness to it, and so was everyone else, and I was standing there.
[03:46:03.546 --> 03:46:05.227]  They come across as an act of love.
[03:46:05.468 --> 03:46:08.750]  He's saying the same thing right now with radical Islam.
[03:46:08.930 --> 03:46:10.571]  And we can't have that in our country.
[03:46:10.691 --> 03:46:12.073]  It just won't work.
[03:46:12.273 --> 03:46:13.073]  We need strength.
[03:46:13.494 --> 03:46:14.074]  Governor Bush.
[03:46:14.534 --> 03:46:17.577]  Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency.
[03:46:18.077 --> 03:46:18.978]  That's not going to happen.
[03:46:19.478 --> 03:46:20.419]  And I do have the strength.
[03:46:22.961 --> 03:46:25.462]  See, you have to understand, this is a very hardcore organization.
[03:46:26.143 --> 03:46:33.827]  And the Nazi money is estimated, if you read in these reports, in the trillions in current money.
[03:46:34.187 --> 03:46:44.153]  Hundreds of billions then, gold, diamonds, artwork, wired money, businesses that the Nazis invested in in Mexico, and in the rest of Central and South America.
[03:46:44.814 --> 03:46:48.256]  And again, Mexico had a big German relationship in World War I and World War II.
[03:46:49.491 --> 03:47:00.498]  Mexico got intelligence for the Germans and launched attacks on Texas and other states during World War I. Now, again, the West started World War I. I'm not demonizing the Mexicans for that.
[03:47:00.838 --> 03:47:10.344]  It's just, you need to understand there's a major German influence in Mexico because the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, which is Germanic, ran Mexico for about 30 years or so.
[03:47:11.064 --> 03:47:13.526]  You just look into Maximilian and the rest of it, they finally killed him.
[03:47:14.066 --> 03:47:17.669]  So, you have to understand that this is a very serious situation.
[03:47:18.189 --> 03:47:20.871]  And I've given you the background, I've given you a lot of pieces to this.
[03:47:22.052 --> 03:47:36.302]  We don't know the amount of money they got, but the word from leaks, the word from sources, the word that's come out in some of these reports and skull and bones, is the Bushes came from nowhere to be, you know, very close to the presidency, even in Prescott's time.
[03:47:37.296 --> 03:47:50.642]  And having fabulous wealth and now 200,000 acre plus ranches in South America with military command bases and helicopter pads because they really are like James Bond villains and they really are dangerous.
[03:47:50.662 --> 03:47:57.606]  The whole fake, weak, Eddie Haskell, Mr. Nice Guy thing that you see Jeb Bush putting on is just that.
[03:47:57.626 --> 03:48:04.629]  It is a total act and Donald Trump needs to understand there's a reason Ross Perot dropped out and said the Bushes have threatened to basically kill my family.
[03:48:06.556 --> 03:48:07.697]  It's because that's what they did.
[03:48:08.297 --> 03:48:09.038]  I'm here in Texas.
[03:48:09.118 --> 03:48:11.339]  Again, I have the inside baseball, but that all came out at the time.
[03:48:12.100 --> 03:48:18.203]  And Trump needs to know he is up against some very serious people whenever Jeb looks at him and says, you're not going to be president.
[03:48:18.424 --> 03:48:18.964]  You understand that?
[03:48:20.025 --> 03:48:21.806]  People need to know who these folks are.
[03:48:21.866 --> 03:48:26.229]  It's a big scandal when it turns out the queen of England was a Nazi and her uncle was.
[03:48:27.011 --> 03:48:30.492]  Well, it's a big scandal here that it's never really come out in U.S.
[03:48:30.552 --> 03:48:48.540]  press like it should, and hasn't been investigated, that the head lawyer for the Nazis, I mean the very head one, who they admitted squirreled all the money away, and who was used at the end of World War II to bring the Nazis in to fight the Russians, and then help them hide their money, that made a lot of U.S.
[03:48:48.580 --> 03:48:49.280]  officials rich.
[03:48:49.720 --> 03:48:53.402]  So this is this grafting onto the Nazis, into American culture,
[03:48:54.474 --> 03:49:00.160]  And why we see so many of these fascist tactics out of the bush is they are Rockefeller Republicans.
[03:49:00.701 --> 03:49:01.662]  That's what they call themselves.
[03:49:01.942 --> 03:49:03.604]  The Rockefellers funded the Nazis as well.
[03:49:04.165 --> 03:49:06.327]  It's the very same crew of people.
[03:49:06.587 --> 03:49:07.348]  They're fascist.
[03:49:07.849 --> 03:49:09.951]  And they'll use any system they can to gain control.
[03:49:10.151 --> 03:49:12.994]  They'll use socialism at the grassroots to make you dependent.
[03:49:13.835 --> 03:49:15.337]  And that's why Jeb Bush is so bad.
[03:49:16.710 --> 03:49:18.391]  I will not vote for Hillary or Jeb Bush.
[03:49:18.431 --> 03:49:20.652]  They are both so evil, I cannot say who's worse.
[03:49:21.172 --> 03:49:26.434]  But the Clintons do not have this ultra, super criminal James Bond background.
[03:49:27.054 --> 03:49:31.416]  They're more like hillbilly tyrants that work with the Bushes that ended up getting into the power structure.
[03:49:31.436 --> 03:49:32.336]  They're super bad.
[03:49:34.577 --> 03:49:35.437]  But I don't know who's worse.
[03:49:35.497 --> 03:49:37.598]  I mean, would Republicans go to sleep if Jeb Bush got elected?
[03:49:37.618 --> 03:49:39.038]  He could ram through stuff like his dad did?
[03:49:39.679 --> 03:49:42.780]  Or if Hillary gets in, will it wake up so many people and then we can impeach her?
[03:49:44.022 --> 03:49:47.844]  I mean, I don't know the pros and cons of this because I just can't support either one.
[03:49:48.164 --> 03:49:51.245]  So sure, Ted Cruz may not be perfect, Donald Trump, Rand Paul.
[03:49:51.705 --> 03:49:53.206]  I know who the Bushes are.
[03:49:53.486 --> 03:49:56.987]  I've been an investigative reporter and a journalist for 35 years.
[03:49:57.228 --> 03:50:00.269]  I've worked in every major media market in the United States.
[03:50:00.929 --> 03:50:05.811]  And I've written for more than a hundred newspapers and magazines nationally and internationally.
[03:50:06.331 --> 03:50:11.753]  So last September 17th, I became the first journalist in U.S.
[03:50:11.773 --> 03:50:14.194]  history to go to the U.S.
[03:50:14.234 --> 03:50:27.299]  National Archives and the Library of Congress and pore over the thousands of pages of documents in both places to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt or any refutation of the facts
[03:50:27.939 --> 03:50:41.383]  That Prescott Bush, the grandfather of George W. Bush, and George Herbert Walker, his maternal great-grandfather, for whom his daddy is named, were Nazi traitors to the country who should have been tried for treason.
[03:50:41.703 --> 03:50:55.287]  Prescott Bush was the grandfather of George W. Bush and the father of George Herbert Walker Bush, and George Herbert Walker Bush is named for his father-in-law, George Herbert Walker.
[03:50:56.367 --> 03:51:06.650]  Prescott Bush graduated from Yale in 1917 and was in Skull and Bones with E. Roland Harriman, who was the younger brother of W. Averill Harriman.
[03:51:06.910 --> 03:51:09.091]  The Bush family really had nothing going.
[03:51:09.131 --> 03:51:13.652]  They were essentially social climbers and opportunistic people.
[03:51:13.952 --> 03:51:19.074]  At the time that Prescott Bush met Dorothy Walker, he was a tire salesman.
[03:51:20.160 --> 03:51:32.510]  And George Herbert Walker, as all fathers do when their daughter's going to marry someone, said in his heart, you know, it's not an appropriate thing socially that my daughter marry a tire salesman.
[03:51:32.970 --> 03:51:40.036]  So he brought Prescott Bush first into Brown Brothers Harriman and then Union Banking Corporation.
[03:51:40.536 --> 03:51:42.857]  In actuality, it was anything but a bank.
[03:51:42.937 --> 03:51:50.438]  It was essentially a Nazi money laundering operation that had a lot of tentacles into a lot of different other businesses.
[03:51:50.478 --> 03:52:00.201]  They owned a shipping line called Hamburg American Line, for example, which was the first Nazi front business seized, although the line was no longer operational in 1942.
[03:52:01.741 --> 03:52:06.267]  In the early 1930s, it transported Nazi spies into the U.S.
[03:52:06.728 --> 03:52:16.201]  and then their promotional ads offered cash rewards to any American citizens who would go back on Hamburg American lines and proselytize for Hitler.
[03:52:17.402 --> 03:52:18.523]  Eight months after the U.S.
[03:52:18.543 --> 03:52:26.869]  had entered the war, the New York Herald Tribune ran a front-page article, Hitler's Angel Has 3 Million in U.S.
[03:52:26.929 --> 03:52:27.209]  Bank.
[03:52:27.789 --> 03:52:32.232]  And it caused a major scandal and just rocked the world of politics.
[03:52:32.693 --> 03:52:41.639]  Brown Brothers Harriman, which George Herbert Walker and Prescott Bush were affiliated with and partners in, worked with IG Farben, which operated Auschwitz.
[03:52:42.239 --> 03:52:59.932]  Prescott Bush, he did a number of things that were not only anti-American, but were pro-Hitler, and he did all that he could to proselytize for Hitler and the rise of his Third Reich, because the largest client, Fritz Thyssen, of his patron W. Averill Harriman,
[03:53:01.207 --> 03:53:06.134]  Dictated what kind of behavior he would practice to enhance his own career.
[03:53:06.575 --> 03:53:16.128]  So he was put on the board of directors of Union Banking Corporation and he was also a shareholder in Union Banking Corporation along with E. Roland Harriman.
[03:53:17.094 --> 03:53:28.100]  What's interesting about what the documents show is that they clearly state that all of the shareholders were phantom shareholders for Fitz Thiessen and did his bidding directly.
[03:53:28.601 --> 03:53:35.905]  So the point I'm making is it's not as if they bought these shares of stock as a passive investment to hopefully profit from the war.
[03:53:36.425 --> 03:53:41.728]  They were directly doing the bidding of the individual who built the Nazi war machine.
[03:53:42.688 --> 03:53:56.393]  Some very shocking documents that I saw at the Library of Congress two weeks ago on August 9th had to do with the hearings of the McCormick-Dickstein Committee of November 1934.
[03:53:57.093 --> 03:54:04.696]  They show that Prescott Bush and the DuPont family, the Remington family, and J.P.
[03:54:04.736 --> 03:54:05.136]  Morgan
[03:54:05.876 --> 03:54:12.239]  Tried to overthrow the US government, assassinate FDR, and put a Hitler-style fascist state in place.
[03:54:12.820 --> 03:54:35.252]  I have in my possession testimony from the McCormick-Dickstein Committee in November of 1934 by one of the fascist plotters that they were going to follow Hitler's model exactly and impose martial law on the United States, round up unemployed people that were worthless to the economy and troublemakers and Jews and put them into internment camps,
[03:54:35.772 --> 03:54:42.058]  And their plan was, if necessary, to exterminate the people that could not be part of the effort.
[03:54:42.678 --> 03:54:54.029]  The only reason the coup attempt in 1934 didn't succeed is that they hired the wrong general to lead it, General Smedley Butler, the great Marine hero, two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner.
[03:54:54.489 --> 03:55:01.814]  Who worked with the plotters just long enough to be able to identify who they were and then blew the whistle on them to Congress.
[03:55:02.094 --> 03:55:12.221]  Incredibly, after being warned by the FBI and the Justice Department and the Treasury Department to cease and desist in their Nazi dealings, they had continued them until 1951.
[03:55:14.082 --> 03:55:43.222]  There had been 28 additional seizures of Nazi assets and Nazi business fronts between late 1942 and 1951, and that they had moved Nazi assets into Switzerland, Brazil, Argentina, and Panama, and they had continued to do business with their primary Nazi patron, who was Fritz Thyssen, who backed Hitler beginning in 1921, and who was the wealthiest man in Germany, and a steel and coal baron, who with his partner, Friedrich Flick,
[03:55:44.222 --> 03:55:48.343]  Essentially built the Nazi war machine along with IG Farben.
[03:55:48.423 --> 03:56:06.609]  In 1951, when Fritz Thyssen died in Argentina, Union Banking Corporation was liquidated by the US government and Prescott Bush received 1.5 million dollars for his holdings in his Nazi business and that was the beginning of the Bush family fortune for all intents and purposes.
[03:56:07.029 --> 03:56:09.152]  Schwarzenegger is the son of a Nazi.
[03:56:09.232 --> 03:56:10.693]  He has praised Nazis.
[03:56:10.733 --> 03:56:11.935]  He has praised Hitler.
[03:56:12.495 --> 03:56:18.362]  He talked last night in terms like we will not falter, we will not waver, we will win this war on terror.
[03:56:18.682 --> 03:56:23.467]  He's a leader who doesn't flinch, who doesn't waver, and does not back down.
[03:56:26.147 --> 03:56:30.610]  Well, that's exactly the speeches that Hitler made after the Reichstag fire.
[03:56:31.130 --> 03:56:40.715]  Terrorism and the homeland being under attack are precisely the issues that Hitler used to subvert everything within the German system of government.
[03:56:40.795 --> 03:56:42.596]  This is a criminal regime.
[03:56:43.097 --> 03:56:46.939]  They not only emulate Hitler, but its genesis comes from Hitler.
[03:56:47.359 --> 03:57:06.600]  And I defy anyone, a historian, journalist, author, anyone, to come forward and disprove my premise that you cannot differentiate Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939 and the Reichstag fire and his attempt to dominate the world from George W. Bush's unprovoked invasion of Iraq,
[03:57:06.840 --> 03:57:07.100]  I think?
[03:57:27.890 --> 03:57:37.454]  That unreality can become reality and reality can be subverted to fantasy political subterfuge right before your eyes.
[03:57:37.554 --> 03:57:51.439]  So there's just an endless broken record that is leading up to the present era that the Bush family has had a single goal for a hundred years which is to become the most powerful family on the planet and to rule the world.
[03:57:52.219 --> 03:58:02.006]  It's critical that every citizen of this country rise up and do something because the day of reckoning is at hand and these people are Nazis.
[03:58:02.046 --> 03:58:04.128]  They are practicing Nazi philosophy.
[03:58:04.488 --> 03:58:08.051]  They are mimicking Nazi tactics and time is running out.
[03:58:09.761 --> 03:58:16.585]  That's right, and if you don't get involved, if you stand on the sidelines, we will have another Bush in the presidency.
[03:58:17.326 --> 03:58:18.006]  Don't forget that.
[03:58:18.206 --> 03:58:23.170]  This has been Rob Doo for the fourth hour of the InfoWars.com Alex Jones Show Overdrive.
