[00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:15.727]  This is the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite.
[00:00:16.047 --> 00:00:16.527]  Good evening.
[00:00:16.868 --> 00:00:23.031]  The parents of kidnapped Patricia Hearst today heard directly from their daughter for the first time since her abduction.
[00:00:23.698 --> 00:00:43.736]  As a member of the notorious Symbionese Liberation Army, Sarah Jane Olson, formerly Kathleen Ann Celaya, was partly responsible for the death of Myrna Opsal, the 42-year-old mother of four children, who was in the bank to deposit receipts from her church during a bank robbery near Sacramento, California, on April 21, 1975.
[00:00:43.816 --> 00:00:44.416]  Patty Hearst,
[00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:54.521]  who was acting as the getaway driver gave information that led the police to implicate the SLA in the robbery and murder.
[00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:58.722]  Hearst also stated that Celaya was one of the actual robbers.
[00:00:59.222 --> 00:01:05.864]  And according to Patty Hearst, Celaya also kicked a pregnant teller in the abdomen, leading to a miscarriage.
[00:01:06.304 --> 00:01:13.186]  On August 21st, 1975, the LAPD discovered several bombs attached to the bottom of their cars.
[00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:23.133]  Celaya was accused of planting the bombs in an attempt to avenge the SLA members who had died a year earlier in a standoff with the LAPD.
[00:01:23.353 --> 00:01:28.056]  In February 1976, a grand jury indicted Celaya in the bombing case.
[00:01:28.436 --> 00:01:32.079]  Celaya disappeared and became a fugitive for 23 years.
[00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.883]  In 1999, Celaya was profiled on the America's Most Wanted television program.
[00:01:38.323 --> 00:01:42.424]  After a tip came in, she was arrested on June 16th, 1999.
[00:01:43.664 --> 00:01:52.527]  Celaya was then charged with conspiracy to commit murder, possession of explosives, and attempting to ignite explosives with intent to murder.
[00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:57.148]  Shortly after her arrest, Celaya legally changed her name to her alias,
[00:01:57.748 --> 00:01:59.189]  Sarah Jane Olsen.
[00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.794]  After serving seven years, about half of her sentence, Olsen was released from prison on March 17, 2009.
[00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:14.900]  This legendary domestic terrorist was allowed to go through the TSA's ultra-secure expedited pre-check system.
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:25.287]  A TSA supervisor failed to reject the quintessential example of a domestic terrorist as defined by the highest standards of the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:02:25.747 --> 00:02:40.818]  We talked about this whistleblower who said they saw and knew someone in line that was a domestic terrorist, had a conviction, went to jail.
[00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.923]  Back in 2008, I believe, we started training our TSOs in critical thinking skills.
[00:02:47.183 --> 00:02:52.927]  According to our investigation, the supervisor ordered that person to go through the pre-check lane.
[00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:54.869]  So basically,
[00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:59.464]  We let a domestic terrorist get on a plane.
[00:02:59.904 --> 00:03:04.388]  Olsen never applied for a pre-check and would have been ineligible had she done so.
[00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.651]  So how did she get pre-check status without applying?
[00:03:09.352 --> 00:03:10.673]  Listen to this pre-check traveler.
[00:03:11.155 --> 00:03:12.636]  It just showed up on your ticket.
[00:03:12.656 --> 00:03:13.896]  Yeah, it just showed up on my ticket.
[00:03:13.976 --> 00:03:28.884]  With a budget of $7.39 billion and an average failure rate of 70%, not only are the TSA stealing from passengers, declaring four-year-olds high security threats, and declaring themselves God.
[00:03:29.637 --> 00:03:34.561]  A TSA agent was arrested on January 3rd here at Terminal 1 at LAX.
[00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:40.405]  He'd just gotten off duty and was behaving erratically, saying, I am God, I'm in charge.
[00:03:40.545 --> 00:03:46.289]  But they can't even stop a legendary domestic terrorist from getting preferential treatment.
[00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:52.593]  It's blatantly obvious the TSA has nothing to do with protecting travelers from terrorists.
[00:03:53.093 --> 00:04:00.939]  The majority of TSA agents have no clue that they are really just pawns in a giant security theater PSYOP.
[00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:09.905]  The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, a University of Maryland project funded by the Department of Homeland Security,
[00:04:10.325 --> 00:04:17.248]  has designated the so-called sovereign citizen movement as the number one domestic terrorist threat in America.
[00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:28.694]  The report takes its definitions from a 2011 study entitled, Profiles of Perpetrators of Terrorism, in which the following characteristics are used to identify terrorists.
[00:04:29.314 --> 00:04:32.615]  Americans who believe their way of life is under attack.
[00:04:33.256 --> 00:04:39.899]  Americans who are fiercely nationalistic, as opposed to universal and international in orientation.
[00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.581]  People who consider themselves anti-global.
[00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:47.964]  Presumably those who are wary of the loss of American sovereignty.
[00:04:48.344 --> 00:04:52.487]  Americans who are suspicious of centralized federal authority.
[00:04:52.887 --> 00:04:56.409]  Americans who are reverent of individual liberty.
[00:04:56.869 --> 00:05:03.894]  People who believe in conspiracy theories that involve grave threat to national sovereignty and or personal liberty.
[00:05:04.674 --> 00:05:07.958]  Or, in a nutshell, concerned Americans.
[00:05:08.538 --> 00:05:24.314]  No different than the Puritans that embarked on the Great Migration to exercise rights endowed by their Creator, with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.483]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:05:39.783 --> 00:05:42.065]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:52.052]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:05:52.392 --> 00:06:00.614]  That's why we're rolling out on a 100% made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:06:00.814 --> 00:06:03.355]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
