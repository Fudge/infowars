[00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:21.686]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.806 --> 00:00:23.087]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.547 --> 00:00:27.389]  It is December 30th, 2015, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:41.437]  Tonight, Alex Jones speaks with the legendary investigative journalist Seymour Hersh in a bombshell interview about the real U.S.
[00:00:41.497 --> 00:00:43.658]  foreign policy in Syria.
[00:00:43.938 --> 00:00:45.459]  I don't know how history is going to judge this.
[00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:52.525]  As you can gather, stories like this in the mainstream press don't get copied.
[00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:57.329]  Then, Google Chrome sets out to suffocate Donald Trump.
[00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.392]  Plus, a Happy New Year's gift from InfoWards.
[00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:05.496]  Some of the best rants of the year from Alex Jones.
[00:01:05.976 --> 00:01:06.276]  Wait a minute!
[00:01:06.477 --> 00:01:08.178]  I thought you wanted to act tough, man!
[00:01:08.438 --> 00:01:10.240]  I thought you wanted to kill me!
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.721]  I thought you were strong!
[00:01:12.202 --> 00:01:12.502]  No!
[00:01:12.642 --> 00:01:13.503]  You're not a man!
[00:01:13.703 --> 00:01:15.064]  You're the fake image of one!
[00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:17.026]  You don't build anything!
[00:01:17.326 --> 00:01:18.587]  You're not even alive!
[00:01:18.768 --> 00:01:21.290]  Your women and children don't belong to you!
[00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.832]  They belong to the globalists who conquered you!
[00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.580]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.161]  You can't survive without it.
[00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:34.261]  But where do you get it?
[00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:40.325]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:46.268]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:01:46.468 --> 00:02:03.329]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:04.009]  We're good to go.
[00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:54.663]  You know here at InfoWars a lot of times we get called fear mongers and you're trying to scare people and do all this and that just because we're bringing you the information of the day but we've seen a very hard push over the past year especially coming up upon New Year's telling you to be afraid to be vigilant do all these things of course you should always be vigilant in your daily lives but now we have all these terror threats without any type of
[00:02:56.601 --> 00:03:04.224]  Yes, we've seen people like ISIS and of course the San Bernardino shooters do things, but there's really no credible terror threat.
[00:03:04.564 --> 00:03:10.086]  And now we see heavily armed anti-terror cops to send a message on New Year's Eve to Times Square.
[00:03:10.506 --> 00:03:19.189]  And basically they document how even though there is no specific credible threat against the country, they're telling everybody to pretty much be afraid and shake in your boots.
[00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:21.150]  Once again, you always want to be vigilant and
[00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.891]  And watchful and protective.
[00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:27.613]  If you do see something, you know, if you see a guy making a pipe bomb, yeah, okay, maybe you go tell the cops.
[00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:30.635]  But you don't have to live your life in any type of perpetual fear.
[00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:31.935]  Go out and enjoy your life.
[00:03:32.056 --> 00:03:38.559]  I mean, when it comes to New Year's Eve, I'm much more concerned about being hit by a drunk driver than I am about being attacked by a terrorist.
[00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:39.620]  Because, you know, look at the...
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.105]  Statistics from the FBI, you're more likely to get hit in the head with a hammer than you are to be killed by a terrorist.
[00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:51.990]  We see similar things going on in Brussels, where they actually cancelled New Year's Eve the fireworks due to a threat.
[00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:54.232]  So it's really going all over.
[00:03:54.712 --> 00:03:59.417]  Once again, you know, we always hear that the terrorists hate us for our freedoms, they hate us for our celebrations.
[00:03:59.457 --> 00:04:03.340]  Well, they don't have much to hate us for anymore if you just stay at home and not enjoy your life.
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.481]  So enjoy your life.
[00:04:04.521 --> 00:04:05.402]  Just be safe about it.
[00:04:05.442 --> 00:04:07.384]  And once again, watch out for those drunk drivers.
[00:04:07.924 --> 00:04:10.987]  Now, something else people are trying to watch out for, Donald Trump.
[00:04:11.707 --> 00:04:13.849]  The Trump is, you know, a very controversial guy.
[00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:20.514]  He's, you know, probably one of the top five people of the year as far as just being in the public eye, whether you love him or hate him.
[00:04:20.835 --> 00:04:26.239]  And now somebody is taking exception to that and actually making an app to where you can filter out Donald Trump.
[00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:29.121]  And it's something that operates on Google Chrome.
[00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:31.944]  And you can suffocate the presidential candidate on the web.
[00:04:32.444 --> 00:04:34.286]  And they have a great image, there it is right there.
[00:04:34.806 --> 00:04:35.427]  Trump filter.
[00:04:36.027 --> 00:04:39.308]  Erase Donald Trump from the internet and make the internet great again.
[00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.830]  So, I mean, if you had enough of Trump, you can put that in.
[00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.651]  I just thought it was a funny story, you know.
[00:04:45.271 --> 00:04:53.655]  I've said before, you know, if the election was held tomorrow, I personally would not vote for Trump, but, you know, people like him for whatever reason, and as an American citizen, you have the right to do that.
[00:04:54.275 --> 00:05:02.201]  Now Trump, as well as many other people, have made Wired Magazine's most dangerous people of 2015 as far as an internet presence.
[00:05:02.661 --> 00:05:05.703]  Now we said Donald Trump, also Julian Assange is on the group.
[00:05:06.184 --> 00:05:08.125]  ISIS is on this group, on the list.
[00:05:08.545 --> 00:05:10.907]  James Comey, the FBI director, is on the group.
[00:05:11.387 --> 00:05:14.830]  And one guy in particular, right here in the city of Austin, Texas, Cody Wilson.
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.082]  You guys know him as the guy behind the printable gun technology.
[00:05:19.102 --> 00:05:23.124]  He also does dark wallet and a lot of work with bitcoins and those type of things.
[00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:30.529]  And the reason why he's on the list, according to the author, is because Cody has made something with the Ghost Gunner, as he calls it.
[00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:37.313]  It's a milling machine that allows you to create a metal body for an AR-15 with no background check or even a serial number.
[00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:41.317]  Which to me is a very irrational fear at this point in time in history.
[00:05:41.818 --> 00:05:44.220]  Because, let's do a little bit of role playing, okay?
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:55.954]  Let's say I'm an ex-con, I just got out of prison, a violent ex-con, not somebody sent in under a nickel and dime drug charge, but you know, I actually hurt somebody, and I get out of prison, I've been plotting my revenge, and I'm out in the streets and I'm gonna do some damage.
[00:05:56.494 --> 00:06:13.534]  Now, am I going to go buy a Ghost Gunner machine, all the materials and everything else, learn how to do this stuff from using the internet, take weeks, months, trying to just get the knowledge to do it, as well as thousands of dollars to get the equipment itself, or am I going to go give $300 and buy a pump-action shotgun?
[00:06:14.275 --> 00:06:16.536]  Yeah, I mean, it's completely irrational.
[00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:22.137]  Yeah, you can make things in the privacy of your own home, but if you're hurting for cash, you're not gonna go make some ghost gunner.
[00:06:22.477 --> 00:06:30.839]  Maybe some James Bond or some spy guy wants to use a disposable gun, like a printable gun, but to any criminal on the street, no, they're gonna go buy a gun, black market.
[00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:36.540]  Yes, you can buy anything else black market, you know, a snub-nosed .38 shotgun, something similar to that.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.281]  So it's completely irrational, in my opinion, to put Cody on the same list as ISIS.
[00:06:42.942 --> 00:06:45.584]  That's a little bridge too far there, Wired Magazine.
[00:06:45.964 --> 00:06:53.771]  And hopefully we'll have a chance to have Cody on the show early in the new year so we can explain more about the technology and why people are afraid of it in general.
[00:06:54.611 --> 00:07:00.136]  Now let's go to David Knight with a hot topic talking about the state of gun rights here in the United States of America.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.984]  Republican legislators are threatening to remove Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's protection detail.
[00:07:07.304 --> 00:07:16.652]  The Democrat governor, former campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, and his attorney general are eager to enact new gun control laws without involvement from the legislature.
[00:07:17.052 --> 00:07:22.157]  So Attorney General Haring announced that he would no longer recognize concealed carry permits from 25 states.
[00:07:23.618 --> 00:07:24.559]  Just like that.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:32.889]  One guy tells the most law-abiding, most vetted people, you can no longer protect yourself, protect your family.
[00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:38.034]  He implies these 25 other states don't have the same standards of background checks that Virginia does.
[00:07:38.675 --> 00:07:39.215]  Not true.
[00:07:39.796 --> 00:07:47.199]  So Republicans in the Virginia legislature are saying if the governor is so afraid of guns, we're not going to surround him with armed state policemen.
[00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:56.403]  And the people in Virginia need to tell the governor that if he won't allow them to protect themselves, they're not going to pay for him to be protected by an army of bodyguards.
[00:07:56.924 --> 00:07:59.044]  For more information, go to Infowars.com.
[00:07:59.325 --> 00:07:59.885]  I'm David Knight.
[00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:07.835]  And here's a prime example of why you need to have your Second Amendment right here in the United States of America.
[00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:14.709]  We have a woman, a mother, who stopped home invasion suspects actually killing them, three of them, who were armed when they came into her home.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.882]  Before shots were fired, here's the three young men caught on home surveillance, all armed, lurking outside.
[00:08:21.982 --> 00:08:24.323]  Around 6 this morning, they kicked their way in.
[00:08:24.764 --> 00:08:26.785]  One suspect was shot, killed, later found outside by police.
[00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:45.323]  And it's not just there.
[00:08:45.383 --> 00:08:55.751]  We've seen the police chiefs in Milwaukee, the police chiefs in Detroit, saying that you, the citizen, need to take it upon yourselves to be responsibly trained, responsibly armed, and defend yourselves.
[00:08:55.791 --> 00:08:59.454]  Because they admit, we can't be every place to protect you all the time.
[00:08:59.494 --> 00:09:00.835]  And I cannot agree with that more.
[00:09:01.276 --> 00:09:05.199]  Even if you do, even if the officer is around or somewhere in the area.
[00:09:05.499 --> 00:09:07.501]  Let's give you another role-playing example.
[00:09:08.121 --> 00:09:12.665]  The cop shows up, he sees one guy with a butcher knife, another guy with a baseball bat, they're swinging them at each other.
[00:09:13.045 --> 00:09:21.211]  He doesn't know who's the home invader, he doesn't know who's the homeowner, so it could potentially put you in a dangerous situation if let's say you're the guy with a butcher knife trying to defend yourself.
[00:09:21.491 --> 00:09:29.057]  That's why if you have the equalizer being the firearm, you could shoot the guy if necessary, or maybe at least hold him at gunpoint until the police arrive.
[00:09:29.357 --> 00:09:34.401]  So I definitely don't want to see these stricter gun control policies that people are trying to push through.
[00:09:34.901 --> 00:09:54.783]  Come in 2016 because really what we've seen we saw the report just the other day coming out of California the I can't recall exactly with the wording of it but it's to where you could call pretty much anonymously say hey I think you know Joe over here is planning some type of mass shooting and it could all go all the way up to a judge and they could potentially take away your firearm rights.
[00:09:55.103 --> 00:09:59.006]  For a extended period of time, while the investigation is ongoing.
[00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:01.828]  And I understand, you know, you have things like mass shooters.
[00:10:01.888 --> 00:10:06.932]  If you do suspect your neighbor is up to something, you may want to call the police and report on it.
[00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:10.475]  But at the same time, you have people who just may get in an argument.
[00:10:10.715 --> 00:10:14.138]  You know, I got in an argument with Bob over there.
[00:10:14.418 --> 00:10:19.082]  He owns a firearm, just like we saw with Pierce Morgan, the guest who was on his show when Alex was on.
[00:10:19.462 --> 00:10:24.726]  They brought him on later, and he says, I wouldn't feel comfortable having an argument with Alex Jones when he has 50 guns in his house.
[00:10:25.006 --> 00:10:30.390]  That's the type of guy who will call and can potentially get your firearms taken away, and I do not support that one bit.
[00:10:31.691 --> 00:10:34.493]  Now another thing I don't support, this Affluenza thing.
[00:10:34.853 --> 00:10:51.926]  You know, I'm not a big fan of putting people in prison, especially non-violent offenders, this of course is a violent offender, but if your defense, when you go to court, you know, you have your lawyers and the judges and all that there, if your defense is you are completely irresponsible and should not be held accountable for your actions,
[00:10:52.426 --> 00:10:58.530]  That's the type of person who needs to be in prison, not people who make some type of say, hey, it was just so far beyond me.
[00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.631]  I can't be held responsible for my actions.
[00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:01.832]  You need to go to prison.
[00:11:02.252 --> 00:11:03.933]  And now we see the affluenza team.
[00:11:03.973 --> 00:11:12.819]  The guy who ran over people in a drunk driving incident was given 10 years probation, which I thought was exceptionally lax and lenient on the young man.
[00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:15.601]  He decided to flee the country and now has been caught.
[00:11:16.341 --> 00:11:28.047]  And he was caught down in Mexico along with his mother, and they're saying that he may not be transported to the United States just yet, but the guy is in custody, and I definitely think this is the type of person who should be in a prison cell.
[00:11:28.827 --> 00:11:32.489]  It's completely ridiculous for this guy to go out here and do this heinous crime.
[00:11:32.529 --> 00:11:35.471]  He's out partying, he breaks his probation, and then he decides to run.
[00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:38.153]  I wonder if they're going to use the same type of excuse again.
[00:11:38.494 --> 00:11:44.479]  Well, his mother is so wealthy and well off that she didn't understand that taking her son out of the country was a violation of his probation.
[00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:50.705]  Oh, they put them both in the jail where they can't hurt anybody else or waste any more taxpayer dollars having to look for him.
[00:11:51.065 --> 00:11:52.726]  And I believe it was the sheriff of their county.
[00:11:52.746 --> 00:11:54.288]  I believe it was Harris County here in Texas.
[00:11:55.578 --> 00:11:58.161]  He was saying that, yeah, I don't think you should give this kid probation.
[00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:01.084]  He's just going to break probation, which is exactly what happened.
[00:12:01.125 --> 00:12:03.968]  So you should occasionally listen to your local sheriff.
[00:12:04.508 --> 00:12:10.235]  Now, a guy who is, uh, I guess he hasn't violated probation, but he just went to jail, got out of jail.
[00:12:10.295 --> 00:12:11.356]  That is Bill Cosby.
[00:12:11.877 --> 00:12:16.040]  He has posted a one million dollar bail after being charged with sexual assault.
[00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:20.004]  We're going to talk about this more with Leanne McAdoo coming up in the next segment.
[00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:23.466]  The differences between Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton.
[00:12:23.907 --> 00:12:26.208]  Because Bill Cosby gets accused of all this stuff.
[00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:28.410]  It's an international news story overnight.
[00:12:28.751 --> 00:12:32.694]  People coming out of the woodwork and what happens he eventually lands up in a jail cell.
[00:12:33.214 --> 00:12:37.238]  Meanwhile, people have been accusing Bill Clinton of things for decades.
[00:12:37.538 --> 00:12:44.424]  The guy's still running around, he's going to college campuses, he's doing political speeches, book signings, all this other stuff.
[00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:49.489]  And if you dare bring up the allegations against Bill Clinton, then, oh, you're just anti-Hillary.
[00:12:49.749 --> 00:12:51.450]  It's some type of political play to knock her down.
[00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:55.274]  It's like, no, we want this guy to be held accountable for the things that he's been accused of.
[00:12:55.834 --> 00:12:58.575]  Also, people who need to be held accountable, Planned Parenthood.
[00:12:58.915 --> 00:13:00.355]  We see a new annual report.
[00:13:00.636 --> 00:13:05.877]  They've reported a whopping 300,000 abortions in the fiscal year, and $553 million in government money.
[00:13:11.567 --> 00:13:12.547]  And it's always the debate.
[00:13:12.928 --> 00:13:14.388]  It's my body, it's my choice.
[00:13:14.428 --> 00:13:17.129]  This is what the pro-abortion advocates say.
[00:13:17.489 --> 00:13:18.069]  And that's fine.
[00:13:18.169 --> 00:13:20.310]  We don't need to talk about religion or politics or anything else.
[00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.051]  If it's your body, it's your choice.
[00:13:22.171 --> 00:13:24.632]  You go do what you want to do, but it's my money, it's my choice.
[00:13:24.752 --> 00:13:26.032]  I'm not paying for your damn abortion.
[00:13:26.452 --> 00:13:30.414]  And we're going to go on to our last story before we go on to a special report from John Bowne.
[00:13:30.434 --> 00:13:32.234]  Then we'll come back with more special reports.
[00:13:32.515 --> 00:13:35.816]  We have Cy Hirst, who was on the Alex Jones Show today, as well as many other things.
[00:13:36.556 --> 00:13:40.179]  Paul, that's Rand Paul, appalled by the NSA spying on Congress.
[00:13:40.599 --> 00:13:41.360]  And I'll give it to Rand.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:47.724]  He's been talking about the NSA and all their dirty deeds for a very long time, back when they were just spying on you and me.
[00:13:48.165 --> 00:13:51.047]  And many politicians remained silent until it came knocking at their door.
[00:13:51.647 --> 00:13:57.452]  Feinstein was fine with you and me being spied on, but then when she started getting spied on, she found out they were looking at her as well.
[00:13:57.772 --> 00:13:59.374]  Same thing with the CIA director.
[00:13:59.414 --> 00:14:00.635]  Was it Petraeus or Panetta?
[00:14:00.895 --> 00:14:02.637]  The guy who got caught up in that big scandal?
[00:14:02.917 --> 00:14:04.318]  They were fine until it happened to them.
[00:14:04.378 --> 00:14:10.824]  So, let's go to a special report from John Ballin, then we'll be back later with more content right here on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:14:18.004 --> 00:14:23.648]  When it comes to telephone calls, every member of Congress has been briefed on this program.
[00:14:25.309 --> 00:14:32.955]  With respect to all these programs, the relevant intelligence committees are fully briefed on these programs.
[00:14:33.875 --> 00:14:40.120]  These are programs that have been authorized by broad bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006.
[00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:54.394]  And at the outset it's important to understand that your duly elected representatives have been consistently informed on exactly what we're doing.
[00:14:55.195 --> 00:15:00.800]  The apparatus of the Obama administration's NSA tentacles apparently have zero boundaries.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:11.188]  After spying on journalists, foreign dignitaries, and the average Joe, it has finally now come to light that Obama and company have been spying on Congress itself.
[00:15:11.428 --> 00:15:16.152]  I'm appalled by when we listen in on foreigners' conversation when they're talking to Americans.
[00:15:16.172 --> 00:15:20.055]  We're scooping up tens of thousands of conversations of Americans.
[00:15:20.135 --> 00:15:23.157]  This is a real problem because it's a real invasion of our privacy.
[00:15:23.557 --> 00:15:31.003]  At this point, it wouldn't surprise anyone if funeral arrangements for the Fourth Amendment were announced within the next few days.
[00:15:31.343 --> 00:15:38.908]  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.670]  No, sir.
[00:15:42.216 --> 00:15:42.716]  It does not.
[00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:45.497]  Not wittingly.
[00:15:45.957 --> 00:15:53.838]  As the communications of allies such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were monitored, so were their interactions with U.S.
[00:15:53.898 --> 00:15:59.600]  members of Congress, as well as American private interest groups, with links to the foreign leaders.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.080]  One unnamed U.S.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.801]  official revealed to the Wall Street Journal that the practice raised fears.
[00:16:05.221 --> 00:16:06.061]  Oh, sh**!
[00:16:07.182 --> 00:16:11.325]  The executive branch would be accused of spying on Congress.
[00:16:11.625 --> 00:16:20.333]  The Obama administration were wary of this and so simply allowed the NSA to decide what to share without making any specific requests.
[00:16:20.673 --> 00:16:23.856]  We didn't say do it, a senior US official said.
[00:16:24.136 --> 00:16:25.918]  We didn't say don't do it.
[00:16:26.238 --> 00:16:33.845]  You can see how it would stifle speech if you're going to eavesdrop on congressmen and that it might stifle what they say or who they communicate with.
[00:16:33.985 --> 00:16:38.929]  We absolutely need more controls on the NSA and more controls on our intelligence agencies.
[00:16:39.289 --> 00:16:40.970]  Forget controls, Senator Paul.
[00:16:41.271 --> 00:16:42.452]  We need heads to roll.
[00:16:42.692 --> 00:16:46.575]  And where is the President during this unprecedented breach of the Constitution?
[00:16:46.795 --> 00:16:54.481]  If you hadn't noticed, President Obama is down in Hawaii on an extended two-plus week vacation that is costing taxpayers no less than...
[00:16:57.102 --> 00:16:57.803]  $470,000 per day.
[00:16:58.103 --> 00:17:09.348]  Once Obama finally leaves office, if he does, he will have spent nearly $70 million of taxpayer money on just 7 Hawaiian vacations alone.
[00:17:09.648 --> 00:17:13.350]  The last time I checked, the President's annual salary was $400,000 per year.
[00:17:15.031 --> 00:17:20.093]  With a $50,000 annual expense account and $19,000 for entertainment.
[00:17:20.313 --> 00:17:36.021]  When did anybody agree to fund $70 million of taxpayer money so that our thief and chief could live like a billionaire and focus on the new Star Wars film while putting his toes in the sand and simultaneously destroying our founding principles?
[00:17:36.341 --> 00:17:43.344]  Early this morning a House panel hastily announced it had opened an investigation into the overreaching intelligence collection of Congress.
[00:17:43.664 --> 00:17:44.705]  Can you hear that sound?
[00:17:44.985 --> 00:17:48.047]  That's the sound of Tricky Dick rolling in his grave.
[00:17:48.668 --> 00:17:52.811]  I have never profited, never profited from public service.
[00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:54.111]  I've earned every cent.
[00:17:54.472 --> 00:17:59.715]  I welcome this kind of examination because people have got to know whether or not their president's a crook.
[00:18:00.336 --> 00:18:01.196]  Well, I'm not a crook.
[00:18:01.917 --> 00:18:03.818]  I've earned everything I've got.
[00:18:03.918 --> 00:18:05.379]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:18:16.317 --> 00:18:21.238]  Shane Steiner's involvement with InfoWarsLife.com truly happened in an organic way.
[00:18:21.378 --> 00:18:29.981]  I went to high school with Shane, his brother, knew his parents well, and he was visiting the office once, hadn't been to the office in years, and said, wow, I notice you're making and selling supplements.
[00:18:30.001 --> 00:18:30.761]  Do these really work?
[00:18:30.801 --> 00:18:35.862]  Because I've tried a lot of supplements as a workout enthusiast, and I really think most of them are hype.
[00:18:35.902 --> 00:18:37.403]  And I said, here, take some home, try it.
[00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:44.048]  Well, a few weeks later, he came in, blown away, and said, I want to buy three boxes of this stuff to give my friends and family.
[00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:45.969]  It's simply amazing.
[00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:47.290]  He said, why does it work so well?
[00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.854]  And I said, listen, go to Infowarslife.com, watch the informational videos with Dr. Group and others.
[00:18:52.074 --> 00:18:53.575]  They understand how it all works.
[00:18:53.855 --> 00:18:55.436]  I know that it works for me.
[00:18:55.556 --> 00:18:56.697]  That's all I understand.
[00:18:56.957 --> 00:19:02.001]  The science, the facts, the research, people's testimonials, they're all on Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:02.021 --> 00:19:03.002]  You can check it out for yourself.
[00:19:03.602 --> 00:19:04.683]  I wanted to go to the gym.
[00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:14.788]  I wanted to push myself and work out harder, and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that, which I would have never done.
[00:19:14.808 --> 00:19:17.329]  I never would have done that two years ago.
[00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:21.551]  Shane has said over and over again, more than just libido and energy,
[00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:23.873]  It made him want to get into the gym more.
[00:19:24.214 --> 00:19:25.675]  It made him want to get in better shape.
[00:19:25.715 --> 00:19:28.338]  And believe me, the Steiners have amazing genetics.
[00:19:28.879 --> 00:19:31.322]  His brother is a world champion steer wrestler.
[00:19:31.662 --> 00:19:35.647]  His dad, Bobby Steiner, is a famous world champion bull rider.
[00:19:35.847 --> 00:19:37.509]  They've got natural genetics.
[00:19:37.949 --> 00:19:42.675]  But when you added this to the mix, in Shane's own words, it took him to the next level.
[00:19:54.972 --> 00:19:56.673]  Shane noticed the mental clarity.
[00:19:57.134 --> 00:20:00.616]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass.
[00:20:00.736 --> 00:20:02.037]  He's already completely shredded.
[00:20:02.237 --> 00:20:04.899]  I gotta admit, for me, the biggest effect has been libido.
[00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:11.303]  Now, I've never claimed to have a body like some beach model, but back when I was 20, 22 years old and worked out every day, I looked great.
[00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:17.368]  But over the years and being married, having three kids, working 18 hours a day, I gained basically 100 pounds.
[00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:20.650]  And it's been a long process of losing that weight in the last four years.
[00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.392]  But if you look at the photos and the videos,
[00:20:23.752 --> 00:20:24.112]  We're good to go.
[00:20:42.837 --> 00:20:52.901]  This has actually made me feel so good that here lately, about a year ago, I started training jiu-jitsu and that kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing.
[00:20:52.921 --> 00:21:05.407]  I mean, it's amazing that two years ago I was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now I'm training with MMA fighters and just doing stuff that I never thought that I would be doing ever again.
[00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:07.528]  So, Supermail Vitality has
[00:21:08.408 --> 00:21:08.929]  I don't know.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.140]  You'll love it.
[00:22:03.068 --> 00:22:12.433]  Bottom line folks, you want to discover the power of super male vitality and super female vitality for yourself by visiting InfoWarsLife.com today or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:19.594 --> 00:22:21.635]  We've been talking today about the year in review.
[00:22:21.655 --> 00:22:25.097]  One of the hot topics Leigh-Anne is that of Bill Cosby.
[00:22:25.217 --> 00:22:30.359]  You know, and I think it's very interesting how Bill Cosby can be accused of all these things over decades.
[00:22:30.719 --> 00:22:33.120]  And it's an international news story pretty much overnight.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.962]  Now we just saw him do the perp walk and they've taken him into custody.
[00:22:35.982 --> 00:22:36.802]  He's made bail now.
[00:22:37.242 --> 00:22:38.943]  But you think about somebody like Bill Clinton.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:43.686]  Who's been doing these or been accused of the same things Bill Cosby has for decades on end.
[00:22:44.167 --> 00:22:50.912]  And when you bring it up that he's done these things or at least been accused of them, oh you're a sexist, you're attacking Hillary, you're bringing this up just for political points.
[00:22:51.092 --> 00:22:51.873]  Right, exactly.
[00:22:51.913 --> 00:22:53.254]  It's just a political talking point.
[00:22:53.334 --> 00:23:02.301]  Meanwhile, we've seen for years them using the war on women and Republicans hate women as their talking point to go after the Republican Party.
[00:23:02.642 --> 00:23:06.725]  And so then when you want to throw it back in their face, then of course you're just politicizing
[00:23:07.205 --> 00:23:08.987]  Something that, you know, really wasn't a big deal.
[00:23:09.127 --> 00:23:10.088]  Mind your own business.
[00:23:10.288 --> 00:23:12.570]  Bill and Hillary worked it out in their own relationship.
[00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.271]  Why should the country be concerned about it?
[00:23:14.792 --> 00:23:19.295]  And we're going to talk about that right now, of why the country should be concerned about it.
[00:23:19.376 --> 00:23:23.679]  Why it is fair game with these sexual allegations against Bill Clinton.
[00:23:23.699 --> 00:23:25.060]  And they're not even allegations.
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:30.705]  I mean, he has admitted to affairs and also had to pay out Paula Jones.
[00:23:31.166 --> 00:23:33.648]  So, you know, this is someone that is a serial predator.
[00:23:34.008 --> 00:23:35.289]  Just like Bill Cosby.
[00:23:35.589 --> 00:23:37.790]  But you're not hearing about that on the mainstream media.
[00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.292]  What you are hearing about is Bill Cosby.
[00:23:40.512 --> 00:23:43.734]  And of course, it's because he did have to, you know, go do the perp walk.
[00:23:44.154 --> 00:23:53.080]  So he was appearing in court today to face these sexual assault charges stemming from a 2004 incident with Andrea Constand.
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.542]  So he has had to post a million dollars bail.
[00:23:56.862 --> 00:23:58.783]  He was forced to hand over his passport.
[00:23:59.123 --> 00:24:01.745]  But he hasn't entered a plea deal just yet.
[00:24:02.305 --> 00:24:09.690]  Um, now Constand claims that Cosby gave her three blue pills with wine one night at his mansion and then he sexually molested her.
[00:24:10.271 --> 00:24:14.153]  The charge against him is punishable by five to ten years behind bars, $25,000 fine.
[00:24:14.313 --> 00:24:17.436]  Now she's just one of more than 50 women who have come forward
[00:24:21.138 --> 00:24:32.121]  Obviously some of those people may or may not be true, but more than 50 women have come forward in the past year alone claiming to be victims of, that they were drugged and sexually assaulted by Bill Cosby.
[00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:44.464]  Now Breitbart today decided to repost one of their articles from last year, where they were pointing out how the media hunts Bill Cosby, but then they celebrate Bill Clinton.
[00:24:44.684 --> 00:24:44.924]  Yes.
[00:24:45.124 --> 00:24:56.830]  And they have really been doing that in these past couple of weeks, of course, because Donald Trump, as soon as Hillary tried to pull out that gender card and sexism card, he was like, really?
[00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.010]  Don't go there.
[00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:00.691]  And so, you know, that's one thing I got to give Trump credit.
[00:25:00.771 --> 00:25:02.772]  Love him or hate him, he does not back down.
[00:25:02.812 --> 00:25:07.514]  And I'm actually enjoying watching him rattle the establishment a little bit.
[00:25:08.055 --> 00:25:10.376]  But so now Breitbart is going back and they're pointing out now,
[00:25:11.056 --> 00:25:25.705]  Here, I think because it was a very racially inflamed last year, they were kind of taking the case where you see how the media goes after Herman Cain or also the, who was a Supreme Court Justice, Clarence Thomas, of course.
[00:25:25.725 --> 00:25:28.667]  So they went after these two black men and Bill Cosby as well.
[00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:31.288]  Meanwhile, Bill Clinton is allowed to skate free.
[00:25:31.949 --> 00:25:36.331]  But of course, we've seen them go after like John Edwards and the whole Wienergate thing.
[00:25:36.371 --> 00:25:38.473]  So, you know, I don't think that's totally fair.
[00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:53.138]  But they point out how this is President Bill Clinton, all of these women against him, that he was accused of rape by multiple women, one of them stemming back as far as 1969.
[00:25:53.959 --> 00:25:58.262]  Okay, this is where one of the first alleged incidents falls back.
[00:25:59.282 --> 00:26:09.270]  But he was forced to settle a lawsuit and his first, one of the first accusers that came forward, Juanita Broderick, she wasn't like these Cosby accusers.
[00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:11.972]  She didn't even want to be put out in the media.
[00:26:12.012 --> 00:26:15.115]  She didn't even want to have any kind of financial lawsuit or anything.
[00:26:15.555 --> 00:26:16.996]  She was a reluctant witness.
[00:26:17.757 --> 00:26:25.020]  But they forced her to testify, so the media went out of their way to circle the wagons around the Clintons and discredit her.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.341]  They called her a liar, all of this stuff.
[00:26:27.662 --> 00:26:29.422]  So where was Hillary Clinton?
[00:26:29.462 --> 00:26:36.286]  She's trying to run her whole campaign on, we need to believe the victims of sexual violence and we believe that your voice should be heard.
[00:26:36.346 --> 00:26:38.467]  She actually made a video saying that.
[00:26:38.947 --> 00:26:43.509]  When she stands accused of defaming, threatening these women.
[00:26:43.729 --> 00:26:47.932]  Yeah, because we saw that video as she was at some type of Q&A session.
[00:26:48.353 --> 00:26:52.996]  And she's up there talking about all the rights of the victims, and somebody says, well what about the people that accused your husband?
[00:26:53.016 --> 00:26:55.238]  She was like, well those people, those women disproved.
[00:26:55.538 --> 00:27:02.984]  Yeah, and once you disbelieve them, and she just sat there like frozen in space of like, oh goodness, someone finally asked me the question.
[00:27:03.064 --> 00:27:05.606]  I thought we had screened all of the questioners here.
[00:27:05.666 --> 00:27:06.627]  How'd she slip in?
[00:27:07.167 --> 00:27:12.812]  Yeah, that was a really, I don't know who that person was, but that was some awesome citizen journalism there.
[00:27:13.212 --> 00:27:14.153]  But yeah, let's take a look.
[00:27:14.233 --> 00:27:26.619]  So these are just some of the sexual stories and allegations besides the famous Monica Lewinsky scandal, you know, where Bill Clinton went after his former intern, who was like 21 at the time.
[00:27:27.139 --> 00:27:31.861]  So we have Eileen Wellstone, I mentioned, she claimed that he raped her in 1969.
[00:27:32.022 --> 00:27:33.922]  Juanita Broderick claimed he raped her in 1978.
[00:27:34.363 --> 00:27:38.945]  Jennifer Flowers claimed to be his mistress for 12 years.
[00:27:39.305 --> 00:27:42.367]  Kathleen Wiley, she was a former White House aide.
[00:27:43.047 --> 00:27:46.611]  She claimed Clinton sexually assaulted her in 1993.
[00:27:47.092 --> 00:27:51.197]  And then, of course, Paula Jones sued him for sexual harassment in 1994.
[00:27:51.257 --> 00:27:56.243]  The lawsuit was dropped after there was an $850,000 out-of-court settlement.
[00:27:56.343 --> 00:28:00.488]  And I do believe that was where he lied under oath and that was where he was impeached.
[00:28:01.189 --> 00:28:11.293]  Okay, and so even with all of that, the DNC is still coming out and saying, if you want to come after Bill Clinton, do so at your own peril.
[00:28:11.594 --> 00:28:13.474]  This is actually Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[00:28:13.534 --> 00:28:14.815]  Those words came out of her mouth.
[00:28:15.275 --> 00:28:20.538]  She said, polls show that if he were to run for re-election, he'd be elected right now.
[00:28:20.898 --> 00:28:25.880]  He's one of the most revered people in politics and men in the world.
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.981]  That's what she said!
[00:28:28.661 --> 00:28:30.402]  Let me pump the brakes on that.
[00:28:30.862 --> 00:28:34.286]  I don't know too many people, little boys, who want to grow up and be like Bill Clinton.
[00:28:34.366 --> 00:28:34.567]  Right.
[00:28:34.627 --> 00:28:36.048]  Well, so that's what she's basically saying.
[00:28:36.068 --> 00:28:41.335]  It's okay to sexually assault people and still be revered in the Democratic Party as long as you're Bill Clinton.
[00:28:41.355 --> 00:28:41.635]  Hold on.
[00:28:41.655 --> 00:28:47.783]  Let me interject here, Leigh Ann, because we see the rape or the sexual assault thing is such a hot topic on college campuses.
[00:28:48.203 --> 00:28:52.949]  Everywhere you hear, you know, rape culture, you know, what, should we have campus carry or not to stop these rapists?
[00:28:52.969 --> 00:28:54.751]  Should we do this or that to stop the rapists?
[00:28:54.891 --> 00:29:00.397]  It's such a big issue, but if you dare talk about somebody who's been accused of things or had settlements about it, Ms.
[00:29:00.417 --> 00:29:08.066]  Flowers or somebody, Larry Nichols, talked to us about, if you have all these things going on and it's a president of the United States, nobody wants to touch it, can't touch it.
[00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:14.767]  No, it's completely off limits and we've seen the media do this, of course, when Obama was running there were so many topics that were completely off limits.
[00:29:14.787 --> 00:29:17.128]  You weren't allowed to bring it up because he needed to be elected.
[00:29:17.508 --> 00:29:19.368]  And the same thing is happening now with Hillary Clinton.
[00:29:19.968 --> 00:29:33.371]  I pointed this out earlier this week, CNN actually had a panel, it was all women on the panel, and the lady opened the panel with, is Bill Clinton sexist or does he simply like women?
[00:29:34.724 --> 00:29:36.524]  So where is the rape culture?
[00:29:36.584 --> 00:29:39.065]  Where is the rallying around women accusers?
[00:29:39.305 --> 00:29:40.885]  He just likes women, Sha'Carri.
[00:29:41.226 --> 00:29:41.886]  You know what I mean?
[00:29:41.906 --> 00:29:45.226]  He took it a little too far, because he just likes women too much.
[00:29:45.587 --> 00:29:52.028]  Well, I saw that clip a little bit before we got on air, and I was really kind of surprised to see a bunch of women take that angle.
[00:29:52.048 --> 00:29:56.169]  He just really likes women so much that he forces himself upon them.
[00:29:56.169 --> 00:30:08.437]  Right, and this is Hillary Clinton who's just running this whole campaign of how it's time for women to, you know, the first woman president needs to be elected, but she expects everyone to just forget about Bill Clinton's sexual assault, or sexual harassment.
[00:30:08.717 --> 00:30:14.401]  But here's the other thing, because I know when all of these allegations against Bill Cosby first started to surface,
[00:30:14.861 --> 00:30:24.566]  People were really rightly angry with the media because they were like, you guys covered this up for all of these years and he just continued to make millions of dollars for all of these decades.
[00:30:24.606 --> 00:30:28.587]  He continued to assault these women because the media, they never believed them.
[00:30:28.707 --> 00:30:33.690]  And so you were, you know, they were upset about the fact that he was like raking in the dough, you know.
[00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:35.831]  Somewhat similar to Jimmy Savelle.
[00:30:35.911 --> 00:30:38.512]  I mean, Jimmy Savelle was messing with kids and Bill Cosby was messing with women.
[00:30:38.692 --> 00:30:38.892]  Right.
[00:30:39.052 --> 00:30:45.158]  Well, Bill Cosby, of course, he could continue to make that money, but so did Bill Clinton.
[00:30:45.778 --> 00:30:46.099]  Okay.
[00:30:46.159 --> 00:30:49.622]  And so now this is obviously something that we've talked about before with the Clinton Foundation.
[00:30:50.142 --> 00:30:52.564]  She said that they were dead broke when they got out of the White House.
[00:30:52.604 --> 00:30:56.788]  But of course, since then, they've made like a hundred and something million dollars.
[00:30:56.988 --> 00:30:58.629]  Bill Clinton in speaking fees.
[00:30:58.669 --> 00:31:01.932]  Yeah, they make thousands of dollars to go to these speaking engagements.
[00:31:01.952 --> 00:31:02.432]  You're exactly right.
[00:31:02.452 --> 00:31:03.093]  Millions, yeah.
[00:31:03.153 --> 00:31:05.434]  And so this is coming out today.
[00:31:05.454 --> 00:31:11.459]  This, I believe, is CNN, where they're like, Hillary needs to set some ethics guidelines.
[00:31:11.499 --> 00:31:16.002]  And it's like, oh yeah, let's go ahead and see if she's going to start setting those guidelines right now.
[00:31:16.423 --> 00:31:25.330]  But they point out how while she was the Secretary of State, Bill Clinton reportedly earned tens of millions of dollars in speaking fees
[00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:26.290]  I don't know.
[00:31:40.575 --> 00:31:42.017]  Low pay to play.
[00:31:42.177 --> 00:31:43.238]  A very powerful report.
[00:31:43.258 --> 00:31:43.839]  Thank you Leanne.
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:48.785]  Now coming up we have an interview, the bombshell interview Alex Jones conducted with Cy Hirsch.
[00:31:49.145 --> 00:31:57.815]  He's a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and he's been documenting how the Pentagon is refusing to back Obama's orders, the very unconstitutional ones, to support ISIS.
[00:31:57.835 --> 00:32:00.178]  That's coming up next and you do not want to miss it.
[00:32:10.336 --> 00:32:12.904]  This is an American president.
[00:32:13.245 --> 00:32:14.389]  Just add puppet.
[00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:17.037]  Then vote and repeat every four years.
[00:32:27.156 --> 00:32:36.423]  You guys have the exclusive for which is a product called Deep Cleanse and why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula almost like the iodine crystals.
[00:32:36.503 --> 00:32:40.285]  We have two unique products that nobody in the world has.
[00:32:40.666 --> 00:32:52.434]  One of the most amazing ingredients in the world and it's called Shilajit and it's actually known as blood of the mountain or rock sweat because thousands of years ago as a matter of fact this ingredient
[00:32:52.634 --> 00:32:59.038]  Was only given to the elite of the elite thousands of years ago up in the Himalayan mountains and in Tibet.
[00:32:59.078 --> 00:33:02.901]  And we wanted to put this in stuff for a couple years, but we couldn't get an organic form.
[00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:03.301]  Right.
[00:33:03.401 --> 00:33:04.422]  I mean, let's explain.
[00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:07.624]  I mean, this stuff's so good, we couldn't put it out for years.
[00:33:07.904 --> 00:33:16.353]  Right, so I had to actually, it's kind of like the iodine crystals, finding a source deep in the earth that we could get the cleanest source available.
[00:33:16.793 --> 00:33:26.363]  But in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan mountains, thousands of years ago they found, they watched these monkeys and during the summer months the monkeys would go up into the mountains.
[00:33:26.384 --> 00:33:27.625]  Now you're being racist against monkeys.
[00:33:27.665 --> 00:33:28.306]  And they would pick
[00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:31.207]  This black substance from the mountains.
[00:33:31.668 --> 00:33:38.171]  And so in Russia, they actually, it grows in Russia and the mountains and in the Himalayas and only in the summer.
[00:33:38.272 --> 00:33:46.476]  And shilajit is actually the decomposition of up to 7,000 different medicinal herbs.
[00:33:46.536 --> 00:33:53.200]  So it decomposes, all these different herbs decompose in the Himalayan mountains and the volcanic soil up there.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.483]  And what happens in the summertime... So it's almost like an oil from
[00:33:58.343 --> 00:34:01.046]  Yes, it's high in fulvic acid, it's high in humic acid.
[00:34:01.086 --> 00:34:05.411]  Because they're always claiming oil is really from decomposed animals and plants.
[00:34:05.972 --> 00:34:10.417]  There is some oil that is based from fossils, but most of it's really abiotic.
[00:34:10.818 --> 00:34:14.823]  So this is a true fossil source?
[00:34:14.843 --> 00:34:15.583]  I mean, explain it to me.
[00:34:16.284 --> 00:34:16.624]  It is.
[00:34:17.024 --> 00:34:22.345]  It's really the decomposition, like I said, of over 7,000 different medicinal herbs and plants.
[00:34:22.505 --> 00:34:26.306]  And with the rocks and the pressure deep in the mountains, it freezes.
[00:34:26.386 --> 00:34:31.327]  And during the summertime and the pressures build it up, it oozes out.
[00:34:31.427 --> 00:34:33.007]  So it literally oozes out of the mountain.
[00:34:33.027 --> 00:34:33.827]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:34.187 --> 00:34:35.188]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:35.228 --> 00:34:38.348]  It's black and it's highly nutritious.
[00:34:39.188 --> 00:34:41.809]  Even in the 1980s, when the Olympic
[00:34:42.529 --> 00:34:44.850]  Athletes in Russia were accused of being on steroids.
[00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:52.231]  They found out that they were actually been given Shilajit because it works as an anabolic as well and it builds muscles.
[00:34:52.431 --> 00:34:53.491]  It's a big dose in there.
[00:34:53.511 --> 00:35:03.234]  The second big main ingredient in there is a volcanic zeolite concentrate and what this formula is designed to do, the Shilajit and the zeolites have a real strong negative charge.
[00:35:03.694 --> 00:35:08.615]  All the metals and chemicals and PCBs and VOCs have positive charges.
[00:35:09.415 --> 00:35:17.522]  So these go in, they grab it, and then they safely eliminate it through the body so you can become healthy.
[00:35:17.563 --> 00:35:21.506]  I mean, this is an amazing formula.
[00:35:21.646 --> 00:35:27.512]  I wish I actually had it, but because this was an exclusive InfoWars Life product, you're the only one in the world that has.
[00:35:28.132 --> 00:35:36.039]  This formula now and, you know, there is going to be a limited supply available when you sell out because you can only harvest this once a year.
[00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:37.260]  How do people take it?
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.622]  How is it recommended that this be done?
[00:35:39.722 --> 00:35:41.424]  Just a daily dose?
[00:35:41.704 --> 00:35:43.446]  Yeah, daily dose.
[00:35:43.526 --> 00:35:44.907]  The instructions are on the label.
[00:35:44.927 --> 00:35:48.330]  You know, of course, I kind of modify it for each individual.
[00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:49.931]  It depends on what your lifestyle is.
[00:35:49.971 --> 00:35:55.076]  I mean, honestly, the best thing to do is for you to avoid all these chemicals and toxins in your environment.
[00:35:55.376 --> 00:35:55.456]  Yeah.
[00:36:17.495 --> 00:36:18.396]  These aren't just great products.
[00:36:18.416 --> 00:36:20.196]  This is how we fund this independent operation.
[00:36:20.216 --> 00:36:25.419]  We're not taxpayer-funded like MSNBC or NPR, and neither is your local station, so support them, folks.
[00:36:25.619 --> 00:36:26.300]  This is a war.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:30.962]  He joins us now.
[00:36:31.042 --> 00:36:32.123]  Mr. Hirsch, thank you for coming on.
[00:36:32.737 --> 00:36:37.682]  The big issue is the question, one of the big questions is, we've demonized Bashar Assad.
[00:36:37.902 --> 00:36:39.404]  He's a dictator, no question.
[00:36:40.145 --> 00:36:41.786]  You cross him, he'll cross you.
[00:36:42.127 --> 00:36:46.992]  He's a lot better than his father, the old man Assad, you know, Hafez Assad.
[00:36:47.512 --> 00:36:50.536]  He was trained to be, he was the second or third son.
[00:36:50.816 --> 00:36:53.639]  Never thought he'd be president because the older boys had the past.
[00:36:54.339 --> 00:37:05.750]  He went to medical school, was an ophthalmologist, married a very second-generation Iraqi woman who worked for one of the national investment houses, American investment houses in London.
[00:37:06.211 --> 00:37:13.257]  And so all of a sudden he's called upon, his older brother dies and his father says, you better get a couple years of army training and get ready.
[00:37:17.711 --> 00:37:18.813]  He's hated in America.
[00:37:18.833 --> 00:37:20.915]  I don't think you can get five votes for him in Congress.
[00:37:21.276 --> 00:37:22.077]  He's demonized.
[00:37:22.157 --> 00:37:23.539]  He's killed.
[00:37:23.839 --> 00:37:25.061]  There's about 250,000 deaths.
[00:37:25.081 --> 00:37:26.583]  But he's a lot better than Al Qaeda.
[00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:49.820]  Well, you know something, and ISIS, and also, things have, I watched him for 6, 8, 10 years, I went back and forth there, I've been going there to the Middle East a lot since 9-11, and he's, you know, he got much more open, you could, you know, you could bank there, you could have the, you can go to an ATM machine, there were 30 different foreign broadcasts on TV, it was, he was opening.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.701]  Yes, when you cross him, he's going to fight you to the end.
[00:37:52.741 --> 00:37:53.762]  It's a war to the end.
[00:37:54.162 --> 00:37:58.224]  He's fighting ISIS, he's fighting Al-Qaeda, he's fighting Al-Nusra.
[00:37:58.544 --> 00:38:00.284]  These are people that hang in garrots.
[00:38:00.324 --> 00:38:01.725]  Some of the horrible stuff that happens.
[00:38:02.045 --> 00:38:06.367]  He's had as many as 200 of his soldiers executed at one sitting by these people.
[00:38:06.427 --> 00:38:09.549]  So, it's a war in which he's killed a lot and they've killed a lot.
[00:38:10.149 --> 00:38:11.409]  And it's a war to the end.
[00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:17.272]  What I wrote about, in part, was that our Joint Chief,
[00:38:18.215 --> 00:38:19.236]  We're good to go.
[00:38:39.309 --> 00:38:48.333]  Some of the groups we advocate as moderate have already made it clear that if they ever took over the government, no Christians or Alawites as a minority sect.
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:58.387]  She asked that Bashar Assad and about 12% of the people living in Syria belong to, none of them could be allowed to live in the country.
[00:38:58.407 --> 00:39:05.712]  They were talking about genocidal, you know, genocidal cleaning, cleansing, if you will, of a society.
[00:39:06.713 --> 00:39:07.734]  Those are the moderate groups.
[00:39:07.774 --> 00:39:08.855]  So there you are.
[00:39:09.695 --> 00:39:10.576]  So the option was
[00:39:11.218 --> 00:39:16.502]  The Joint Chiefs looking at the intelligence, looking at the fact that we had been supporting for years covertly.
[00:39:17.202 --> 00:39:19.484]  This is through the CIA, David Petraeus.
[00:39:20.144 --> 00:39:23.207]  I would argue that Hillary Clinton surely should have been aware of this.
[00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:24.327]  She was Secretary of State.
[00:39:24.728 --> 00:39:31.953]  We began to, after Libya fell, we began to funnel stuff that in an earlier article I called the rat line.
[00:39:32.573 --> 00:39:41.217]  A lot of arms from Libya into Turkey, and from Turkey, the gentleman running Turkey, Erdogan, is a total, complete supporter of ISIS.
[00:39:41.537 --> 00:39:45.959]  I don't think there's any question of that, even though we deny that, our intelligence soldiers.
[00:39:46.019 --> 00:39:49.881]  What I wrote about is the fact that two and a half years ago the Joint Chiefs decided,
[00:39:50.874 --> 00:39:55.239]  They can't convince the White House and the State Department with intelligence.
[00:39:55.299 --> 00:40:06.913]  They're just going to begin to do what they can do to try and modify the American policy or make it less, you know, nobody wants to talk about directly challenging a president.
[00:40:06.953 --> 00:40:07.854]  That's not your job.
[00:40:08.255 --> 00:40:09.757]  But I will tell you at this certain level.
[00:40:10.333 --> 00:40:12.834]  At the Joint Chiefs, the level four-star generals.
[00:40:13.154 --> 00:40:16.316]  The oath of office is an oath to the Constitution, not to the President.
[00:40:16.556 --> 00:40:17.336]  That's right.
[00:40:17.556 --> 00:40:18.637]  And it's very traditional.
[00:40:18.657 --> 00:40:20.298]  You can go back to Douglas McCarthy.
[00:40:20.318 --> 00:40:21.918]  You can go back to World War II fighting.
[00:40:22.239 --> 00:40:24.520]  You can go back to terrible fighting in Vietnam.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:37.546]  President Eisenhower, as the President, challenged the military-industrial complex as a system himself, the ultimate level, still a general, saying, I want to challenge the people that want to control our military for their own aims.
[00:40:38.148 --> 00:40:38.688]  There you go.
[00:40:38.848 --> 00:40:39.349]  There you go.
[00:40:39.789 --> 00:40:47.753]  And you can even argue that the hatred for McNamara by the time he was ready to get out of there in 67 because he refused to listen to the generals.
[00:40:48.053 --> 00:40:49.754]  We've always had generals in opposition.
[00:40:50.074 --> 00:40:50.875]  So this isn't new.
[00:40:50.915 --> 00:41:02.641]  What they did, though, instead of directly challenging the Joint Chiefs, as I wrote about, beginning in the summer of 2013, after a lot of intelligence showed that our path was wrong.
[00:41:02.981 --> 00:41:03.942]  We weren't going to win.
[00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:06.523]  If we got rid of Bashar, we were going to have
[00:41:07.023 --> 00:41:09.286]  A government completely full of wackos.
[00:41:09.807 --> 00:41:10.648]  You know, wing nuts.
[00:41:11.189 --> 00:41:13.632]  A hard line that take off their head people.
[00:41:13.812 --> 00:41:14.473]  Clearly worse.
[00:41:15.294 --> 00:41:16.576]  I mean a whole new Afghanistan.
[00:41:17.176 --> 00:41:17.957]  Well, there you go.
[00:41:18.098 --> 00:41:19.800]  Well look, Afghanistan is still a mess right now.
[00:41:20.492 --> 00:41:21.953]  You know, people always talk.
[00:41:22.454 --> 00:41:23.455]  I'm a big supporter.
[00:41:24.656 --> 00:41:25.396]  I was in the Army.
[00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:27.758]  There's nothing better than America.
[00:41:28.079 --> 00:41:29.420]  It's the greatest country to be in.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.921]  But we do have a lot of freedom.
[00:41:31.301 --> 00:41:37.547]  And I will tell you that our special operation forces, the Delta Force, the SEALs, they're terrific.
[00:41:38.007 --> 00:41:40.829]  They're very good at what they do, but they're being miscast.
[00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:52.138]  We're now in 14 and a half years of war against an idea and the Joint Special Operations Command for all of their ability to go hit a house at night and kill people and take them out.
[00:41:52.639 --> 00:41:53.479]  We're not winning that war.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.702]  Well, you know, it's interesting.
[00:41:56.102 --> 00:42:03.891]  What they did was, because they didn't want to go directly to Bashar Assad, because the president had ruled that, you know, that would have been a direct violation.
[00:42:04.211 --> 00:42:12.861]  But we did know that the Germans in particular, the German intelligence service and the German high command, and get this, the Russians and the Israelis,
[00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:16.751]  All three had been in contact with Bashar Assad.
[00:42:17.131 --> 00:42:21.572]  Because all three, even Israel, which sometimes, you know, doesn't always speak what the real policy is.
[00:42:22.112 --> 00:42:23.072]  They've got a lot of problems.
[00:42:23.152 --> 00:42:24.493]  Government problems, leadership problems.
[00:42:24.813 --> 00:42:35.435]  But the guys running the military and intelligence system in Israel had the same point of view as our, the guys running our, at least that were running our Joint Chiefs, because the general at the time was General Dempsey.
[00:42:35.455 --> 00:42:37.556]  They're saying... Martin Dempsey, who's now retired.
[00:42:38.536 --> 00:42:39.376]  He's the new chairman.
[00:42:39.816 --> 00:42:42.877]  And we don't know where he stands on this because publicly he's said little.
[00:42:43.177 --> 00:42:44.538]  He's only a couple months into it.
[00:42:44.558 --> 00:42:47.079]  I understand a very competent Marine named Dunford.
[00:42:47.139 --> 00:42:48.079]  I just don't know much about him.
[00:42:48.539 --> 00:42:54.562]  I know more about Dempsey and... Was Dempsey the big hero in this going to Obama saying...
[00:42:55.502 --> 00:42:57.222]  You know, he wouldn't look at it that way.
[00:42:57.242 --> 00:43:01.463]  He just did something... The issue was, we were going the wrong way.
[00:43:01.483 --> 00:43:07.025]  The Germans and the Russians and the Israelis were begging for intelligence.
[00:43:07.465 --> 00:43:11.046]  One thing America does, and we do it very well, we have terrific intelligence.
[00:43:11.066 --> 00:43:15.027]  We have satellites, we have SIGINT intelligence, we do have people on the ground.
[00:43:15.527 --> 00:43:20.188]  Believe me, we can do better than anybody wants to write about with certain groups.
[00:43:20.248 --> 00:43:21.208]  We can penetrate people.
[00:43:21.628 --> 00:43:25.830]  We're not incompetent, but often it's the leadership that gets you in trouble.
[00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:30.392]  So they decided that, the Germans in particular, were kept on saying, what can you do to help us?
[00:43:30.772 --> 00:43:41.376]  They began in the fall of 2013, we began to shovel stuff that we had about Al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda, ISIS.
[00:43:41.576 --> 00:43:47.398]  We began to shovel information not only about where they were, but what they were thinking, as much as we learned.
[00:43:47.799 --> 00:43:48.739]  And so we enabled
[00:43:49.319 --> 00:43:50.200]  That is right!
[00:44:08.237 --> 00:44:13.859]  As somebody in the article I wrote said, you know, we're doing stuff military to military.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:18.081]  The president may not have known, but there's a lot of stuff he doesn't know about.
[00:44:18.121 --> 00:44:19.782]  So that's the way they got around the issue.
[00:44:20.282 --> 00:44:22.083]  And they began to help it and help Bashar.
[00:44:22.323 --> 00:44:28.525]  Not only that, it was very much a morale builder for the Syrian army to know that they were getting very high level intelligence.
[00:44:29.286 --> 00:44:32.587]  So I don't know how he's going to judge this.
[00:44:34.647 --> 00:44:39.651]  As you can gather, stories like this in the mainstream press don't get copied.
[00:44:40.491 --> 00:44:42.373]  But it doesn't matter because there's the Internet.
[00:44:42.973 --> 00:44:50.839]  You know, there's guys like you and all sorts of other people around the world that pay more attention than often.
[00:44:50.859 --> 00:44:56.423]  The major papers here... You know, I worked for the New York Times for eight or nine years during Watergate.
[00:44:56.463 --> 00:44:58.244]  I won a lot of prizes in Vietnam.
[00:45:01.103 --> 00:45:03.665]  Certainly, the Nixon years, a lot.
[00:45:04.125 --> 00:45:12.131]  And one of the things, you know, is there's not many reporters at a good newspaper who have the kind of, you know, there's nothing special.
[00:45:12.151 --> 00:45:16.293]  I have friends that I know, most of the good guys at the major papers have somebody.
[00:45:16.874 --> 00:45:26.220]  And when you're at that level, where you're, you know, you've got access and you're covering the Pentagon or the State Department or the White House, the last thing you want to do, I know this sounds almost
[00:45:26.886 --> 00:45:27.186]  I think so.
[00:45:36.252 --> 00:45:39.175]  The only thing the editor can do is ask one of the good reporters to do it.
[00:45:39.536 --> 00:45:43.440]  And what they want to do is figure out some way to get this out, you know, turf this, get this off their desk.
[00:45:43.941 --> 00:45:45.142]  So it doesn't really get happened.
[00:45:45.162 --> 00:45:46.584]  It doesn't happen with the papers.
[00:45:47.004 --> 00:45:49.207]  And I understand it because I'm sure I did the same thing.
[00:45:49.727 --> 00:45:54.473]  We're all, you know, we all love what we do and we're more interested in ourselves than anybody else.
[00:45:54.513 --> 00:45:56.695]  That's one of the things about my business that's sort of wacky.
[00:46:14.042 --> 00:46:17.545]  Al Capone owed $150,000 in back taxes to the IRS, and he went to prison.
[00:46:17.745 --> 00:46:22.670]  Al Sharpton, he owes $4.5 million, and he goes to dinner at the White House.
[00:46:37.967 --> 00:46:38.988]  Brain Force is here.
[00:46:39.528 --> 00:46:41.810]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:49.936]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:46:50.714 --> 00:46:54.295]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:46:54.335 --> 00:46:56.675]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:46:57.035 --> 00:47:00.576]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:00.616 --> 00:47:03.757]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:04.257 --> 00:47:09.058]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:09.598 --> 00:47:11.458]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:47:11.818 --> 00:47:16.239]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:16.419 --> 00:47:18.440]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.520]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:20.920]  Exactly.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.762]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:25.262 --> 00:47:33.306]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:47:38.197 --> 00:47:43.202]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:47:43.443 --> 00:47:49.549]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:47:49.749 --> 00:47:56.717]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:47:57.057 --> 00:48:07.003]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:07.563 --> 00:48:13.486]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:13.726 --> 00:48:16.408]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:17.188 --> 00:48:17.568]  Let's do it!
[00:48:41.135 --> 00:48:46.538]  We're going to end our show tonight and pretty much end the year on this, a slate of Alex Jones rants.
[00:48:46.598 --> 00:48:48.118]  That's what Alex is known for.
[00:48:48.198 --> 00:48:56.682]  He's world famous, or some people would say infamous, for all the things that he says and does, the freak outs that he has right here at the desk that I'm sitting at right now.
[00:48:56.722 --> 00:48:59.784]  So here's a small selection of the best rants from 2015.
[00:49:02.025 --> 00:49:05.466]  In 1776 had been in three guerrilla wars.
[00:49:06.407 --> 00:49:08.188]  That's another reason the British were in big trouble.
[00:49:08.993 --> 00:49:11.234]  Oh, they thought some of their soldiers had maybe been in one war?
[00:49:12.294 --> 00:49:13.355]  Had such a high turnover rate?
[00:49:13.555 --> 00:49:15.155]  We're about to find out they've been in three wars?
[00:49:16.536 --> 00:49:17.696]  In the space of 15 years?
[00:49:18.837 --> 00:49:19.797]  So, I mean, I'm nobody.
[00:49:20.658 --> 00:49:24.639]  I mean, our forebears would be running around killing people right now.
[00:49:25.199 --> 00:49:25.480]  Okay?
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:27.580]  They wouldn't be usurped.
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:28.821]  They wouldn't be enslaved.
[00:49:29.021 --> 00:49:32.342]  They wouldn't be run over by a bunch of slick-talkin' underwoods.
[00:49:33.143 --> 00:49:34.023]  They'd strangle them!
[00:49:35.362 --> 00:49:43.438]  And not because they weren't as manipulative as Underwood, but because they were honorable and they were men who could do things out in the open!
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:48.222]  And who had people follow them because they were strong and virtuous!
[00:49:48.902 --> 00:49:52.504]  Not piles of manipulative, lying crap!
[00:49:53.384 --> 00:49:56.405]  I mean, I know, I've read the books written by Edward Bernays.
[00:49:56.785 --> 00:50:00.307]  I've read the papers written by the founder of the Olympic Committee.
[00:50:00.867 --> 00:50:03.328]  I have read the statements by Hitler on sports.
[00:50:03.949 --> 00:50:08.511]  I know it's to manipulate men, where men sit around in fantasy football.
[00:50:08.791 --> 00:50:10.652]  I mean, you might as well game the stock market.
[00:50:11.052 --> 00:50:12.352]  You might as well have fun
[00:50:14.033 --> 00:50:15.895]  It's just, these aren't men.
[00:50:16.075 --> 00:50:17.176]  These aren't men.
[00:50:18.517 --> 00:50:29.927]  These are the type of men who will go work their arms out all day, so they think they're big, who will just do the symbol of being manly, and will say something smart to you, or try to intimidate you, and the minute you turn to them and go, let's go right now!
[00:50:30.607 --> 00:50:32.789]  Just touch me and I'm gonna break your neck!
[00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:36.893]  They go, whoa dude, wait a minute, I thought you wanted to act tough, man!
[00:50:37.113 --> 00:50:39.014]  I thought you wanted to kill me!
[00:50:39.235 --> 00:50:40.376]  I thought you were strong!
[00:50:41.707 --> 00:50:42.007]  No!
[00:50:42.147 --> 00:50:43.028]  You're not a man!
[00:50:43.188 --> 00:50:44.568]  You're the fake image of one!
[00:50:45.048 --> 00:50:46.549]  You don't build anything!
[00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:48.090]  You're not even alive!
[00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:50.791]  Your women and children don't belong to you!
[00:50:50.971 --> 00:50:53.572]  They belong to the globalists who conquered you!
[00:50:53.592 --> 00:50:56.253]  I don't want to be conquered!
[00:50:56.833 --> 00:50:58.454]  I don't want to have my destiny controlled!
[00:50:58.654 --> 00:51:00.255]  I don't want my children brainwashed!
[00:51:00.675 --> 00:51:04.956]  I don't want to be a slave and that humanity's done and we're being phased out!
[00:51:05.297 --> 00:51:05.597]  No!
[00:51:06.781 --> 00:51:08.862]  That's what doctors... We have this report coming up.
[00:51:09.122 --> 00:51:10.123]  Joe Biggs interviewed the mother.
[00:51:10.563 --> 00:51:12.464]  Does your mommy make you wear that dress?
[00:51:12.484 --> 00:51:13.985]  Do you want to wear that dress?
[00:51:14.385 --> 00:51:25.611]  How creepy the government, through private agencies, you go pay, asking weird, creepy, sexual questions about mommy and daddy to your kids.
[00:51:27.212 --> 00:51:28.793]  What a freak show country we are.
[00:51:30.706 --> 00:51:33.348]  And this is worldwide, from Australia to Germany, this is being done.
[00:51:33.929 --> 00:51:41.575]  They banned, in Germany, new construction of single-parent dwellings, or single-family dwellings, because it's hateful to have a family alone.
[00:51:41.936 --> 00:51:44.698]  You need to be in the community house.
[00:51:45.058 --> 00:51:51.864]  I mean, those of us that have read history or read dystopic novels, we know, God, this is like textbook hell.
[00:51:52.425 --> 00:51:53.786]  But see, the young don't know.
[00:51:54.406 --> 00:51:55.788]  They come home to their parents and go,
[00:51:57.034 --> 00:52:00.276]  I'm not a boy, I'm not a girl, I'm a purple penguin!
[00:52:01.417 --> 00:52:05.300]  All designed to go, I'm a purple, I'm a purple, I'm a purple penguin.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:07.181]  Purple penguin, purple penguin.
[00:52:08.262 --> 00:52:11.685]  Oregon allowing 15 year olds to get state subsidized sex change operations.
[00:52:12.325 --> 00:52:13.506]  And you're gonna pay for it!
[00:52:15.009 --> 00:52:16.470]  And you're gonna pay for abortions!
[00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:17.690]  For Obamacare!
[00:52:18.331 --> 00:52:34.038]  Because this is the freedom while foreign banks loot your pension funds and they prepare paramilitary forces and replace the military with robots and prepare Homeland Security in their own documents to take on gun owners, veterans, and the South in some new civil war.
[00:52:34.058 --> 00:52:35.458]  That's in all the public documents.
[00:52:35.738 --> 00:52:37.579]  And then we go, hey, Jade Helms should be watched.
[00:52:37.999 --> 00:52:38.980]  Shut up, racist!
[00:52:41.513 --> 00:52:46.877]  And then I tried to go renegotiate and get new insurance, and they go, sorry, you have to wait until September.
[00:52:46.917 --> 00:52:47.697]  So it's now September.
[00:52:47.717 --> 00:52:51.420]  That's when open enrollment happens, so I can try to go find something cheaper.
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:56.703]  I mean, I used to just call up whoever I wanted and get rates, and no, it's all gone now!
[00:52:57.744 --> 00:52:58.525]  Thanks a lot!
[00:52:59.773 --> 00:53:01.034]  For screwing everyone over!
[00:53:01.235 --> 00:53:06.039]  And then Gruber sits there and laughs and says how dumb we are and how it is a big screw job!
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:07.181]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:53:07.401 --> 00:53:08.082]  Ha ha ha!
[00:53:08.342 --> 00:53:12.927]  And you people stick stickers on your car about what a great deal it is!
[00:53:14.551 --> 00:53:29.923]  You people are part of a schmuck cult, a idiot cult, where you celebrate being used, where you celebrate being morons, where you celebrate being screwed, where you celebrate being fooled, and dragging all the rest of us along with you to hell!
[00:53:33.506 --> 00:53:43.955]  The enemy's operation is so huge, so vicious, so evil, so stealthy, but also so overt.
[00:53:45.213 --> 00:53:59.042]  That it boggles the mind as we are inserted into the beginnings of a false reality designed to make the act of resistance or free thought laughable, impossible.
[00:53:59.642 --> 00:54:11.670]  To quote Bertrand Russell, the population will soon be so conditioned, so drugged, so brainwashed that a rebellion by the proletariat would be as unthinkable
[00:54:12.794 --> 00:54:16.076]  As sheep rebelling against the practice of eating mutton.
[00:54:18.778 --> 00:54:19.619]  Mutton is sheep.
[00:54:23.762 --> 00:54:30.326]  A rebellion by the grassroots would be as unthinkable as sheep rebelling against being slaughtered.
[00:54:31.387 --> 00:54:32.668]  Sheep can't rebel.
[00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:34.309]  They're sheep.
[00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:35.690]  They submit.
[00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:37.011]  They fall.
[00:54:39.993 --> 00:54:41.054]  Will you fall?
[00:54:42.179 --> 00:54:50.002]  They think you will fall as they perch on our chest, smothering us, strangling us in the night.
[00:54:52.483 --> 00:54:59.105]  Or will we become aware of the attack and surge with the power that God gave us to resist?
[00:55:00.445 --> 00:55:10.669]  The enemy has sought to strangle us in our crib before we fully developed, knowing we will tower above these diseased, twisted souls.
[00:55:13.271 --> 00:55:17.296]  They believe that their day of doom is here for humanity.
[00:55:17.816 --> 00:55:29.770]  But I tell the New World Order, and the Rockefellers, and the Rothschilds, and the Saxe-Coburg-Gothas, and the Sods, and all the rest of them, your day of doom is coming!
[00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:31.532]  And you know it!
[00:55:35.583 --> 00:55:39.725]  And your devil cult will fall forever!
[00:55:40.505 --> 00:55:43.547]  Your next fall is forever!
[00:55:44.067 --> 00:55:46.708]  You won't rise from the ashes this time!
[00:55:48.089 --> 00:55:48.869]  This is happening.
[00:55:48.909 --> 00:55:49.869]  This is planned out.
[00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:51.790]  All this stuff's going to happen.
[00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:58.473]  We're here trying to hold it back, and people are complaining, going, hadn't gotten really horrible yet, what's your problem?
[00:55:58.593 --> 00:55:59.774]  Meanwhile, it is getting horrible.
[00:56:01.101 --> 00:56:27.308]  We're trying to hold the gate up while arrows are shooting over and rocks are being thrown on us and we're battling as hard as we can and there's all these slack-jawed folks going, there's no crisis, so what if 100 million people are on welfare, 50 million on food stamps, so what if there's 2 quadrillion in derivatives, so what if we're having a war with Russia, so what if we're funding Al-Qaeda, so what if they're opening the borders after ignoring the law, so what if they shut off our power plants, so what if they carry all this out, I don't care, why don't you quit being so alarmist all day long?
[00:56:29.268 --> 00:56:30.108]  Okay, scum!
[00:56:30.388 --> 00:56:33.209]  Don't come to me when it all... Oh, you already are coming to me.
[00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:35.370]  You want government-guaranteed tuition.
[00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:36.590]  You want more welfare.
[00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:38.030]  You want more corporate welfare.
[00:56:38.331 --> 00:56:41.231]  You love the system because you've never done anything.
[00:56:42.392 --> 00:56:47.613]  I'm here to take on the Communists, to take on ISIS, to take on the New World Order.
[00:56:47.693 --> 00:56:48.113]  I'm here.
[00:56:48.753 --> 00:56:51.994]  And listen, I'm here to show you what the people can do.
[00:56:52.534 --> 00:56:54.875]  We're fighting a bunch of vipers and trash.
[00:56:55.415 --> 00:56:57.836]  And they can't trump the Ace of Spades, and that's the truth.
[00:56:58.643 --> 00:56:59.603]  But don't let anybody see it.
[00:56:59.643 --> 00:57:05.305]  You've got the head of the board that's political saying, don't let the public see this.
[00:57:05.725 --> 00:57:13.447]  And you've got the guy that actually runs the FCC saying, here it is, it's secret with red tape, I know what's in it, it's really bad, but I'm not allowed to tell you.
[00:57:14.927 --> 00:57:23.370]  Well, we've had Senator Graham and Congressman Jones and others that have seen the 28 pages of the 9-11 report that's secret, and it just says our government stood down because Saudi Arabia was quarterbacking 9-11.
[00:57:24.949 --> 00:57:25.130]  See?
[00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:26.032]  Inside job.
[00:57:26.072 --> 00:57:26.693]  Government knew.
[00:57:26.894 --> 00:57:27.696]  Government stood down.
[00:57:27.937 --> 00:57:28.458]  I'm correct.
[00:57:28.638 --> 00:57:29.260]  I'm vindicated.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.383]  Where are the apologies?
[00:57:30.643 --> 00:57:30.984]  Where?
[00:57:31.285 --> 00:57:32.247]  Where are they?
[00:57:46.801 --> 00:57:47.141]  Fight!
[00:57:47.462 --> 00:57:48.523]  Have a fighting spirit!
[00:57:48.583 --> 00:57:49.364]  I know you do!
[00:57:49.804 --> 00:57:51.566]  And I'm saying others that haven't gotten involved.
[00:57:51.986 --> 00:57:55.669]  It's not... When you're lethargic in the Info War, it feels like it's terrible.
[00:57:55.690 --> 00:58:06.159]  But once you actually get in the cockpit, once you get in a gun pod, and start blasting enemy forces in the Info War, and watch them blow up, and then watch them counter-strike, then you're in the war!
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:07.961]  Then you can't get out.
[00:58:08.341 --> 00:58:09.161]  Then you're addicted.
[00:58:09.221 --> 00:58:10.081]  Then you're free.
[00:58:10.482 --> 00:58:12.202]  Then it all starts to fall into line.
[00:58:12.523 --> 00:58:13.643]  Now you're really alive.
[00:58:13.983 --> 00:58:15.904]  Now victory is within grasp.
[00:58:17.265 --> 00:58:18.005]  Yeah!
[00:58:18.425 --> 00:58:19.546]  The fighting spirit!
[00:58:19.566 --> 00:58:20.826]  The liberty!
[00:58:21.327 --> 00:58:23.407]  Rising!
[00:58:23.668 --> 00:58:23.968]  Rising!
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:27.601]  And that's it for our show tonight.

[00:58:40.394 --> 00:58:44.578]  I'm Takari Jackson from the Info Wars Command Center, and we'll see you again tomorrow night.
[00:58:48.823 --> 00:58:49.964]  Knockout is back.
[00:58:50.304 --> 00:59:01.411]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:01.831 --> 00:59:03.532]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:03.993 --> 00:59:13.158]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:13.539 --> 00:59:15.320]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.761]  It's the same price
[00:59:17.481 --> 00:59:23.364]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[00:59:23.904 --> 00:59:30.148]  It's got the GABA, so it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[00:59:30.648 --> 00:59:30.768]  It's $19.95.
[00:59:31.488 --> 00:59:33.830]  You take one or two of these,
[00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:38.213]  And it just is really clean restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[00:59:38.553 --> 00:59:42.476]  It's what I've experienced and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
