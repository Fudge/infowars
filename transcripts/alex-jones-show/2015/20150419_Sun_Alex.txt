[00:00:00.837 --> 00:00:11.807]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:12.988 --> 00:00:20.695]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:31.681]  Nobody.
[00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:37.143]  Nobody stages false flag terror attacks in this country and gets away with it.
[00:00:38.224 --> 00:00:40.685]  You may get away with it in your kangaroo courts.
[00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:43.906]  You may get away with it with your dying dinosaur media.
[00:00:43.926 --> 00:00:53.070]  But in the real court of public opinion, where the rubber meets the road, everybody knows who carried out the Oklahoma City terror attack 20 years ago today, April 19th, 1995.
[00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:57.278]  And it's already 2015.
[00:00:57.978 --> 00:01:00.819]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.781]  We've got a power-packed, very informative, staggering transmission today.
[00:01:06.821 --> 00:01:08.621]  Joe Biggs is back from the border.
[00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:12.903]  He met with counterterrorism folks from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[00:01:13.523 --> 00:01:17.564]  He went across the border where Judicial Watch has reported an ISIS training base.
[00:01:18.064 --> 00:01:20.285]  He'll have breaking news with us on that front.
[00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:22.846]  We have huge vaccine news.
[00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:29.512]  We have mainstream media trying to claim that the mainline Republican Party and conservatives are basically all Tim McVeigh's.
[00:01:29.692 --> 00:01:31.533]  That story's up on Infowars.com.
[00:01:32.334 --> 00:01:35.476]  We've got Iran's ship convoy moves towards Yemen alarming U.S.
[00:01:35.537 --> 00:01:35.957]  officials.
[00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:39.360]  We've got a mystery illness that's killed 18 people in 24 hours.
[00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:47.123]  We've just got a lot of really important news today, and some pro-Second Amendment news, some vaccine news.
[00:01:47.203 --> 00:01:48.043]  It's all coming up.
[00:01:48.523 --> 00:01:58.306]  But first, an extremely informative report that Leanne McAdoo filed on some of the brainwashing and propaganda going on in Congress that we covered earlier in the week.
[00:01:58.626 --> 00:02:05.888]  But she really crystallizes it, where they're implying that bloggers, period, are like cult members or ISIS.
[00:02:06.368 --> 00:02:07.488]  You can't make this up.
[00:02:07.508 --> 00:02:08.809]  Here's our report, and then we'll be back.
[00:02:09.614 --> 00:02:21.603]  Almost like a cult, I would say, that is formed online and they mobilize and they feel like they are part of some enlightened fight against the establishment.
[00:02:21.964 --> 00:02:28.369]  They find an outlet where they can, a platform to voice their deranged views.
[00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:50.607]  That was former RT host Liz Wall testifying about the big bad internet, saying that it provides a platform for fringe voices and extremists, and what a problem it is that conspiracy theorists are dominating online discussions, bypassing all those paid government trolls, and able to be so effective that they're riling up massive amounts of people.
[00:02:51.007 --> 00:02:51.628]  Oh goodness!
[00:02:52.108 --> 00:03:01.711]  Wall was called on as an expert witness at a House Foreign Relations Committee hearing titled, Confronting Russia's Weaponization of Information.
[00:03:02.332 --> 00:03:12.775]  Now the threat there is not combat weapons or war games, but rather the growing popularity of alternative TV and radio programming that challenges the establishment narrative.
[00:03:13.115 --> 00:03:17.037]  Hmm, could that be because people are ready for a little bit of truthful news?
[00:03:17.617 --> 00:03:34.833]  Now, Wahl also went on to characterize those of us involved in this pushback as cult members, completely oblivious of the fact that blindly gobbling up and regurgitating the state narrative of your dear leader without question is in fact cultish behavior.
[00:03:35.393 --> 00:03:40.901]  Wall gained notoriety last year for quitting Russian state media during a live broadcast.
[00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:52.176]  There was a totally inauthentic move that had been planned months in advance and was orchestrated with the help of James Kirchick, who is a former employee of Radio Free Europe.
[00:03:52.777 --> 00:04:00.302]  Radio Free Europe, along with the Voice of America, have been pumping pro-US propaganda around the globe for decades.
[00:04:00.602 --> 00:04:01.823]  It's been very effective.
[00:04:01.923 --> 00:04:02.343]  That's pro-globalist.
[00:04:02.363 --> 00:04:05.145]  So clearly it's a case of do as I say, not as I do.
[00:04:05.585 --> 00:04:14.831]  Now when Wahl talks about RT being a network that doesn't play by the rules, she's speaking of the unspoken rule of reciting White House talking points.
[00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:33.262]  Now, there's no doubt RT definitely puts out pro-Russian propaganda, but it also broadcasts truths about geopolitics and foreign policy that Americans will never see on mainstream corporate networks, precisely because those networks are engaged in propaganda.
[00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:37.086]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:04:37.226 --> 00:04:50.321]  But rather than change their methods to, oh I don't know, actual transparency and truth-telling, they are desperately trying to stifle the rising alternative voices that are effectively promoting freedom.
[00:04:50.961 --> 00:04:53.184]  I'm Leanne McAdoo for InfoWars.com.
[00:04:54.212 --> 00:04:54.933]  That's right, folks.
[00:04:54.993 --> 00:04:57.697]  And again, Leanne, when she makes the point saying pro-U.S.
[00:04:57.737 --> 00:05:01.482]  propaganda, she means globalist propaganda that's hard to destroy the U.S.
[00:05:01.562 --> 00:05:02.563]  effectively.
[00:05:02.583 --> 00:05:04.546]  She means New World Order propaganda.
[00:05:04.566 --> 00:05:06.429]  They just use us as their command base.
[00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:14.833]  I was born on the prairies where the wind blew free, and there was nothing to break the light of the sun.
[00:05:15.193 --> 00:05:17.754]  I was born where there were no enclosures.
[00:05:18.095 --> 00:05:18.695]  Geronimo.
[00:05:19.295 --> 00:05:31.663]  I wonder what he thinks of the permanent checkpoints, where you're quizzed about your citizenship, about having to submit to bag searches to ride public transportation, his thoughts on non-violent offenders riding away in prisons.
[00:05:31.963 --> 00:05:35.685]  They say that in these current times we are more, quote, civilized,
[00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:37.946]  But are we really more free?
[00:05:38.406 --> 00:05:47.088]  When the Persian army demanded King Leonidas and his Spartans surrender their arms, the outnumbered king shouted, Molon lave, or come and take them.
[00:05:47.488 --> 00:05:53.490]  Even though Leonidas was eventually defeated by a much larger adversary, he is not remembered for his loss.
[00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.531]  He lives in history as a beacon of defiance and self-defense.
[00:05:57.751 --> 00:06:00.852]  The desire to disarm the people is nothing new.
[00:06:01.192 --> 00:06:08.256]  Arm yourself with knowledge at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:06:21.683 --> 00:06:29.407]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:33.141]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:34.782 --> 00:06:35.903]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:35.923 --> 00:06:36.644]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:06:36.684 --> 00:06:40.247]  We're live on this Sunday transmission 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:43.830]  Central airing on stations across the country and re-aired by many others.
[00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.511]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:48.053]  Thank you affiliates for carrying the transmission.
[00:06:48.073 --> 00:06:53.818]  Thank you for spreading the word about this important syndicated radio slash TV news program.
[00:06:55.222 --> 00:07:17.220]  With open commentary and open opinion, leaning strongly and unapologetically towards liberty and freedom and family and self-defense and private property and sovereignty and defending the old, defending veterans, defending the unborn, treating people like we want to be treated.
[00:07:18.328 --> 00:07:19.489]  That's what you're going to get here.
[00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:21.430]  We wear it openly on our sleeve.
[00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.752]  The sickening bias of telling the truth, according to the establishment.
[00:07:26.032 --> 00:07:31.876]  The sickening bias of studying history and reading the legislation and really knowing what's going on.
[00:07:32.436 --> 00:07:37.479]  We commit that cardinal sin every minute, actually researching what's going on.
[00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:41.170]  And then raising the alarm worldwide.
[00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.210]  Thank you again for joining us on this Sunday transmission.
[00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.431]  The weekday broadcast, of course, is 11 a.m.
[00:07:46.451 --> 00:07:46.991]  to 2 p.m.
[00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:48.351]  Central Standard Time.
[00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:52.692]  Joe Biggs is going to be in studio with us for several segments.
[00:07:53.332 --> 00:07:57.693]  He and our intrepid cameraman, Josh Owen, went down to the Mexico border.
[00:07:58.133 --> 00:08:02.334]  Joe Biggs went in with some of his old contacts when he was stationed down there in the U.S.
[00:08:02.454 --> 00:08:03.294]  Army at Fort Bliss.
[00:08:04.697 --> 00:08:15.923]  One of the most dangerous areas, probably the most dangerous, in fact they say it's the most dangerous area in Mexico, right across from that US military base there in El Paso.
[00:08:16.404 --> 00:08:21.767]  They have found hundreds of mass graves, with hundreds of people in some cases per mass grave, right across there.
[00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:23.568]  The drug cartels fully control the area.
[00:08:23.968 --> 00:08:32.873]  Judicial Watch came out and reported a week and a half ago that they had credible sources that ISIS was engaged in human smuggling, probably to make money.
[00:08:33.653 --> 00:08:56.369]  uh... with quote other than mexicans a predominantly a middle easterners that are the third largest group coming across it's mexicans and then other than mexicans you think it would be uh... latin americans and others but it's actually chinese and then it's uh... arabs uh... coming in uh... because well i don't get all the reasons why the point is is that some happening and unfolding
[00:08:58.419 --> 00:09:03.421]  Joe Biggs was called through this office by the FBI.
[00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:05.522]  We have the card.
[00:09:05.582 --> 00:09:06.342]  We have their names.
[00:09:06.882 --> 00:09:09.883]  They asked us not to give their names because they're in anti-terrorism.
[00:09:10.183 --> 00:09:10.664]  That's fine.
[00:09:10.684 --> 00:09:11.084]  We won't.
[00:09:11.824 --> 00:09:14.265]  But FBI agents met Biggs at El Paso Airport.
[00:09:14.685 --> 00:09:17.846]  Biggs called FBI field office in El Paso to confirm agent's name.
[00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:19.947]  The FBI agent asked not to be named.
[00:09:20.307 --> 00:09:22.869]  He had an associate with him, due to the fact he's counter-terrorism.
[00:09:22.909 --> 00:09:27.553]  Josh Owens sat with Biggs while agents asked him for intel on ISIS in Mexico.
[00:09:27.994 --> 00:09:35.320]  Agents said Judicial Watch was a credible source, and they look into what they write about, and basically said that they had intel that that was happening, but couldn't comment.
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.983]  So basically confirming that they are looking at ISIS over the border.
[00:09:39.484 --> 00:09:47.751]  The agents wanted to know, again, what he saw, how he got in, and what things stood out in Anarpa.
[00:09:48.786 --> 00:09:52.287]  That area of Mexico, the most dangerous area of Mexico, bar none.
[00:09:54.467 --> 00:09:56.588]  So Joe Biggs will be joining us on that front.
[00:09:56.648 --> 00:09:58.268]  Regardless, it's real journalism.
[00:09:59.208 --> 00:10:02.649]  Journalists do not go into this area of Mexico.
[00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:08.530]  It's totally different than Juarez and other areas that are dangerous, but nothing compared to this.
[00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:10.231]  It's a veritable ghost town.
[00:10:10.987 --> 00:10:16.512]  With very little foot traffic, very little vehicles, and it's where the main cartels basically battle it out.
[00:10:16.952 --> 00:10:19.114]  And so Joe will be joining us to break that down.
[00:10:19.154 --> 00:10:20.015]  And there's more news!
[00:10:21.096 --> 00:10:23.038]  Islamic State, ISIS, has come out.
[00:10:23.118 --> 00:10:31.205]  I've told you they've done this before, and I haven't given a lot of attention, because in the final equation, it's what they're looking for.
[00:10:31.925 --> 00:10:33.246]  They've threatened us.
[00:10:33.346 --> 00:10:33.967]  They've called.
[00:10:35.473 --> 00:10:40.315]  Their official Twitter and Facebook has attacked us, and I ask the question, why are they allowed to operate on Twitter and Facebook?
[00:10:40.675 --> 00:10:54.582]  Because higher-level Western sources want to basically hype this threat, allow this threat to grow, allow attacks to happen, to then get more anti-terror funding, which can then be basically projected onto the American people themselves.
[00:10:55.402 --> 00:10:59.245]  But here it is, InfoWars reporter featured in new ISIS video.
[00:10:59.805 --> 00:11:12.273]  Footage shows dramatized clips of 9-11 attack, gruesome beheadings interspersed with Joe Biggs at the border, and they say in Arabic, yes, InfoWars, yes Joe Biggs, you're right, we are on the border, we can come across.
[00:11:12.893 --> 00:11:15.175]  So that is what ISIS is saying.
[00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:20.438]  And the other articles on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:11:20.899 --> 00:11:24.980]  FBI seeks intel from InfoWars reporter over ISIS border threat.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.962]  You can see both those videos at InfoWars.com right now.
[00:11:30.883 --> 00:11:43.408]  Now, as I said, getting into all of this, what happens is they pass the Patriot Act, which is up for reauthorization now,
[00:11:44.417 --> 00:11:47.039]  Back in 2001, on the heels of 9-11.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:12:01.452]  And the whole thing, I watched the hearings on C-SPAN, was focused on gun owners, veterans, libertarians, but also drug dealers, land rights activists, I mean real criminals, but also people trying to save the country.
[00:12:02.613 --> 00:12:06.116]  The point was, it was not focused on Al-Qaeda.
[00:12:07.577 --> 00:12:09.598]  Now reborn bigger and badder as ISIS.
[00:12:10.439 --> 00:12:12.840]  It was not dealing with that.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.482]  It was always about the general public.
[00:12:15.522 --> 00:12:22.847]  And the Patriot Act is used every few seconds now by the feds in this country to circumvent the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:12:22.887 --> 00:12:28.851]  They've used 9-11 to basically blow giant smoking holes in the Constitution and Posse Comitatus.
[00:12:29.611 --> 00:12:31.652]  Where we have militarization of police and troops everywhere.
[00:12:32.132 --> 00:12:34.174]  And there's always excuses for why it's happening.
[00:12:34.414 --> 00:12:37.816]  There's always a good reason up front, but that's never the real reason.
[00:12:38.096 --> 00:12:43.799]  They gotta convince the military and police, who in many cases are very patriotic and smart people, to go along with this.
[00:12:43.839 --> 00:12:49.102]  So at first, you know, all these different government training operations, it's about fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:12:50.216 --> 00:12:53.638]  But down the road it becomes veterans, gun owners, libertarians.
[00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.219]  And now you see that in the news.
[00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:57.020]  In fact, CNN today.
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:01.082]  How extremist threat remains 20 years after Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:13:01.743 --> 00:13:11.909]  And Kurt Nemo breaks down the article at Infowars.com with the quotes pulled out where they say now all libertarians, conservatives, the Republican Party themselves, they're basically terrorists.
[00:13:12.844 --> 00:13:13.484]  Here's the headline.
[00:13:13.504 --> 00:13:17.245]  Corporate Media McVeigh's Anti-Government Sentiment Now Mainstream in Republican Party.
[00:13:17.706 --> 00:13:21.627]  Columnist Repeats Absurd Fairytale About Republicans and Oklahoma City Bombing.
[00:13:22.027 --> 00:13:33.531]  Yeah, within 35 minutes of OKC bombing happening 20 years ago today in Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, they were blaming talk radio and Rush Limbaugh by name.
[00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:38.072]  Now, I've made three films on Oklahoma City.
[00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:44.661]  I've interviewed the police officers that survived, the families of police officers that were tortured to death by the Justice Department and killed.
[00:13:45.803 --> 00:13:49.165]  I have covered every fashion of it, and I'm not going to spend all day on this.
[00:13:49.185 --> 00:13:49.825]  I'm just going to tell you.
[00:13:50.346 --> 00:14:01.772]  If you're a new listener and you don't know what a self-inflicted wound is, what a false flag is, Hitler blew up, firebombed his own Reichstag, right after being elected, February 27th, 1933.
[00:14:02.493 --> 00:14:05.735]  Nuremberg didn't even declassify it until about a decade ago it was released.
[00:14:06.455 --> 00:14:08.876]  Because government didn't even want you knowing how governments operate.
[00:14:10.137 --> 00:14:11.358]  Because they do it so much too.
[00:14:11.458 --> 00:14:13.039]  Hitler firebombed the Capitol.
[00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:15.720]  And then basically declared martial law.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.461]  The rest is history, you know what happened.
[00:14:17.881 --> 00:14:25.365]  He launched false flags in Operation Himmler, in Glywoods and other areas, to blame Poland for attacking German military bases.
[00:14:25.705 --> 00:14:28.947]  You don't think Hitler just invaded Poland and told Germans because he felt like it.
[00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:31.188]  He blew up his own military bases.
[00:14:32.989 --> 00:14:33.930]  That's declassified.
[00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:35.591]  That came out after World War II.
[00:14:36.231 --> 00:14:41.574]  So, that's what a false flag is, and we've never had one so open and shut as Oklahoma City.
[00:14:43.243 --> 00:14:56.992]  I've interviewed Jane Graham in HUD, who for exercise would take the stairs and saw known FBI, known ATF, and German intelligence, because it later came out in the news, planting the gray sticks of butter.
[00:14:58.893 --> 00:15:02.035]  And the cops that showed up right after the bomb went off, they saw the same guys.
[00:15:02.676 --> 00:15:09.120]  That's why, you know, medical doctor and cop of the year, Terence Yeagey, the drug folks out of the building, that's why they were killed.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:17.822]  And I've talked to Don Browning, the head of the K-9 unit, who the government came into his office and said, we will kill you and your wife if you don't shut up.
[00:15:17.862 --> 00:15:19.203]  So, let me explain something.
[00:15:19.743 --> 00:15:22.124]  McVeigh was a patsy, that was a staged event.
[00:15:23.624 --> 00:15:28.966]  McVeigh basically thought they were just doing a drill and were going to set up white supremacists at Elohim City.
[00:15:29.226 --> 00:15:38.229]  When he found out they were going to go operational, just like Ahmad Salam, who we've had on, New York Times headline, who tried to stop the first World Trade Center attack.
[00:15:38.979 --> 00:15:40.680]  They gave him a real bomb, real detonators.
[00:15:41.141 --> 00:15:41.841]  Let it go forward.
[00:15:41.861 --> 00:15:42.482]  Remember all that?
[00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:43.983]  Same thing with McVeigh.
[00:15:44.263 --> 00:15:46.065]  That's why they hung him out to dry as the patsy.
[00:15:48.527 --> 00:15:49.908]  He did not want to blow up the daycare center.
[00:15:49.968 --> 00:15:51.910]  He was the only guy that didn't want to go along with it.
[00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.171]  And she saw McVeigh with them planting the bombs.
[00:15:54.572 --> 00:15:57.514]  And then the very FBI guys go, we weren't in town, we were in Dallas.
[00:15:58.335 --> 00:16:01.437]  They filled out stuff at the Marriott the day and a half before.
[00:16:01.477 --> 00:16:01.918]  They were there.
[00:16:02.558 --> 00:16:04.700]  So, that's what happened 20 years ago.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:05.441]  A false flag.
[00:16:05.701 --> 00:16:06.902]  We're going to talk to Joe Big straight ahead.
[00:16:09.864 --> 00:16:11.225]  I want more candy!
[00:16:11.265 --> 00:16:11.985]  I want more video games!
[00:16:12.186 --> 00:16:12.286]  Mine!
[00:16:12.306 --> 00:16:13.186]  Mine!
[00:16:13.206 --> 00:16:13.306]  Mine!
[00:16:39.864 --> 00:16:40.644]  I think so.
[00:17:29.545 --> 00:17:30.466]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:17:30.626 --> 00:17:38.310]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lifted weights five days a week, I could swim two, three miles.
[00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.572]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[00:17:41.832 --> 00:17:43.393]  I started an access television show.
[00:17:43.793 --> 00:17:48.576]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[00:17:49.176 --> 00:17:52.018]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:58.262]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a Jabba the Hutt.
[00:17:58.622 --> 00:18:03.465]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[00:18:03.885 --> 00:18:08.748]  I started taking Super Mel Vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[00:18:09.028 --> 00:18:16.115]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Group for InfoWarsLife.com, the results were incredible.

[00:19:23.891 --> 00:19:24.232]  Silver Bullet.
[00:19:29.298 --> 00:19:30.299]  The experts are clear.
[00:19:30.619 --> 00:19:37.584]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:19:37.744 --> 00:19:43.988]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:44.008 --> 00:19:47.591]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:19:47.731 --> 00:19:51.634]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:19:51.935 --> 00:19:56.999]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:19:57.259 --> 00:19:58.180]  Not our iodine.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:04.405]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.
[00:20:04.625 --> 00:20:06.487]  Visit Infowarslife.com today.
[00:20:06.667 --> 00:20:08.028]  See the informational videos.
[00:20:08.228 --> 00:20:09.790]  Read the information there.
[00:20:11.971 --> 00:20:14.554]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:28.486 --> 00:20:34.028]  It's always a tough vote because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt.
[00:20:34.668 --> 00:20:40.409]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not increase our debt.
[00:20:40.429 --> 00:20:43.470]  It does not somehow promote profitability.
[00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.191]  All it does is it says, you've got to pay the bills that you've already racked up, Congress.
[00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:50.090]  That's right.
[00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.491]  Raising the debt does not raise the debt.
[00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:53.092]  And you can keep your doctor, though you can't.
[00:20:53.112 --> 00:20:55.293]  And Obama's not going to come out with your guns, but he did.
[00:20:55.833 --> 00:20:58.314]  That's right.
[00:20:58.334 --> 00:20:59.635]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:59.755 --> 00:21:00.836]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:21:00.856 --> 00:21:01.556]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:21:02.196 --> 00:21:04.237]  Joe Biggs, Infowars.com Report.
[00:21:04.257 --> 00:21:05.578]  We'll be with us for the rest of the hour.
[00:21:06.058 --> 00:21:08.879]  Then I'll cover news, the first few segments of the second hour.
[00:21:08.899 --> 00:21:09.620]  And then we have...
[00:21:11.385 --> 00:21:15.510]  A really interesting group of authors on Confessions of a D.C.
[00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:15.930]  Madam.
[00:21:16.531 --> 00:21:18.033]  I interviewed the D.C.
[00:21:18.053 --> 00:21:19.995]  Madam about a month before she was killed.
[00:21:21.877 --> 00:21:23.659]  And she was trying to tell me stuff off air.
[00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:25.741]  And I said, listen lady, listen to your phone right now.
[00:21:26.022 --> 00:21:26.722]  I don't want to be told.
[00:21:26.823 --> 00:21:28.565]  None of this is not on air.
[00:21:29.673 --> 00:21:31.935]  And they hung her, they killed her, and I investigated it.
[00:21:32.715 --> 00:21:41.421]  We'll talk about that, but they've got some of the inside intel, the first-hand accounts of different cases of things that have unfolded like this.
[00:21:41.961 --> 00:21:46.064]  So that's going to be coming up, understanding how they blackmail people, how they're controlling folks.
[00:21:47.605 --> 00:21:57.632]  If you are criminal interest that want to control government because of the fabulous wealth and power you can have through that, how do you checkmate a country based on due process and freedom?
[00:21:59.002 --> 00:22:04.164]  Well, you declare a national security state, you operate in the shadows, you fund foreign enemies, so there's an outside threat.
[00:22:04.424 --> 00:22:07.385]  You then profit on battling that outside threat.
[00:22:07.665 --> 00:22:12.247]  That outside threat's able to consolidate control in its country, because they can then say that you're a threat.
[00:22:13.727 --> 00:22:16.228]  This is the Hegelian dialectic of problem, reaction, solution.
[00:22:16.548 --> 00:22:26.512]  And if you are the globalists that want to take the guns, open the borders, do the rest of this, but you can't, well, you just staged false flags, like Oklahoma City 20 years ago, and blame it on your political enemies.
[00:22:28.248 --> 00:22:38.592]  And if you can't get Congress to totally open the borders and sign global treaties and shut off the power plants and do all the rest of it, you just start doing it with executive power and say, remove me from office.
[00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:41.833]  But the media then plays along with that.
[00:22:42.273 --> 00:22:44.634]  So we are in a tyranny by any yardstick.
[00:22:44.934 --> 00:22:46.815]  Do I think the military is going to take over tomorrow?
[00:22:46.955 --> 00:22:47.095]  No.
[00:22:48.319 --> 00:23:01.874]  But politicians are trying to put the military and the police into a role of political police, political suppressors, banning free speech, banning filming police, banning criticizing politicians at city halls.
[00:23:02.154 --> 00:23:03.035]  We've all seen the footage.
[00:23:03.276 --> 00:23:09.563]  There's an attempt to shut up dissent in this country, and dissent is the sunlight that will disinfect things.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.741]  Coming up, we're going to cover the waterfront with Joe Biggs riding shotgun with me.
[00:23:14.801 --> 00:23:18.362]  Brain damage victims of swine flu vaccine win $63 million.
[00:23:19.522 --> 00:23:21.343]  That's been released by the federal government.
[00:23:22.103 --> 00:23:23.183]  You won't see that in the news.
[00:23:23.223 --> 00:23:24.523]  I thought they were all safe and effective.
[00:23:25.604 --> 00:23:28.384]  We're going to get into Texas, set to approve open carry of handguns.
[00:23:28.444 --> 00:23:30.605]  Some good news spreading across the country.
[00:23:32.425 --> 00:23:35.726]  The bad news, the end of the license plate as they move towards RFIDs.
[00:23:36.086 --> 00:23:38.067]  Track everywhere you go and tax you by the mile.
[00:23:39.465 --> 00:23:40.926]  That's mainstream news pushing that.
[00:23:40.966 --> 00:23:41.766]  Told you that was coming.
[00:23:42.407 --> 00:23:43.347]  And that ties into this.
[00:23:43.447 --> 00:23:49.831]  Congress is attempting to reauthorize key Patriot Act provisions by sneaking it into USA Freedom Act.
[00:23:50.972 --> 00:23:53.093]  That's Liberty Blitzkrieg on Infowars.com.
[00:23:54.254 --> 00:23:57.556]  Here's an article breaking it down.
[00:23:57.716 --> 00:23:58.056]  What is this?
[00:23:58.676 --> 00:23:59.457]  The London Guardian.
[00:24:00.037 --> 00:24:06.281]  NSA and FBI fight to retain spy powers as surveillance law nears expiration.
[00:24:07.708 --> 00:24:11.009]  Debate reignites on Capitol Hill with Patriot Act set to expire.
[00:24:12.329 --> 00:24:17.110]  And that ties into FBI overstated forensic hair matches in nearly all trials before 2000.
[00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:25.011]  And that was because Frederick Whitehurst, who we've interviewed, the former head of the Crime Lab, went public saying they were basically being ordered to frame everybody.
[00:24:26.051 --> 00:24:27.471]  He's been on the show like four or five times.
[00:24:28.512 --> 00:24:29.332]  It's still going on.
[00:24:29.392 --> 00:24:31.652]  So the thing is, you can't trust any of this.
[00:24:32.132 --> 00:24:36.213]  Does that mean that the FBI... You know, I love Joe Begg's Friday night
[00:24:37.455 --> 00:24:44.685]  And then Saturday he posted videos, you know, in South Texas, in El Paso, at the airport, meeting with the FBI who wanted to meet with him.
[00:24:45.947 --> 00:24:47.449]  Folks are like, what are you doing?
[00:24:47.469 --> 00:24:48.751]  Meet with the FBI, traitors!
[00:24:49.392 --> 00:24:50.334]  We'll meet with whoever!
[00:24:51.423 --> 00:24:54.003]  You know, local, when Joe called me and said, should I meet with them?
[00:24:54.023 --> 00:24:57.544]  I said, if they're local FBI, if they're in the local office, I would meet with them.
[00:24:57.824 --> 00:25:00.605]  They're going to ask you about what you saw, what went on.
[00:25:00.645 --> 00:25:02.805]  If you're going down there again, they'll want to use you as a source.
[00:25:02.825 --> 00:25:05.245]  A lot of people low-level are doing a really good job.
[00:25:05.906 --> 00:25:11.486]  They're just not allowed, just like on 9-11, a bunch of FBI offices in Dallas, Phoenix, Minneapolis, St.
[00:25:11.507 --> 00:25:12.507]  Paul tried to stop what happened.
[00:25:12.667 --> 00:25:13.547]  They were ordered to stand down.
[00:25:13.927 --> 00:25:18.888]  But I said, if it's feds or attached to the Justice Department, do not talk to them, and don't even go to the airport.
[00:25:19.288 --> 00:25:19.508]  Run.
[00:25:20.444 --> 00:25:20.744]  Run.
[00:25:21.445 --> 00:25:23.567]  Because that's Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:25:24.408 --> 00:25:27.451]  You know, that's the folks that brought you the false flags.
[00:25:28.452 --> 00:25:29.953]  That's the Eric Holder FBI.
[00:25:30.233 --> 00:25:31.274]  You don't want to get anywhere near them.
[00:25:31.555 --> 00:25:32.375]  But no, he met with them.
[00:25:32.395 --> 00:25:33.296]  They were pretty good guys.
[00:25:33.797 --> 00:25:34.978]  And Joe's here to talk about that.
[00:25:35.038 --> 00:25:38.942]  His experience is going in the most dangerous area of Mexico right next door.
[00:25:39.842 --> 00:25:55.047]  To the Texas border there by El Paso did a great job Joe What do you want to tackle first meeting with the FBI and then confirming that you know, we take judicial watch is credible But they're unable to go further Or do you want to get into the situation?
[00:25:55.947 --> 00:25:59.848]  That you witnessed inside Mexico Yeah, we can start from the beginning.
[00:25:59.868 --> 00:26:05.330]  You know, it was a Thursday Josh Owens and I were able to fly over into
[00:26:06.806 --> 00:26:14.256]  Right over in Napra and be able to witness some of these different compounds that were in the area and kind of get like a bird's eye view of what was going on.
[00:26:14.276 --> 00:26:21.445]  It was very hard to go through the footage and see anything so that's when I decided hey I'm gonna go into Mexico myself and try and spot something.
[00:26:21.866 --> 00:26:23.748]  I told you that was up to you because it is dangerous.
[00:26:24.389 --> 00:26:31.058]  Yeah, I mean, you know, we talked to some border patrol, I talked to some locals, you know, I had a few people who said they were going to drive me in, and then they all backed out.
[00:26:31.538 --> 00:26:39.168]  Because Annapolis is an area where people, when they were teenagers, would try to go into and see who could stay the longest, and that's how, like, hard they would be, like, as kids.
[00:26:39.188 --> 00:26:42.092]  It's total cartel run, mass graves everywhere.
[00:26:42.392 --> 00:26:46.955]  Yeah, I mean it's... Once you come out of Juarez, when you're not in an opera, it's like being in Iraq.
[00:26:47.436 --> 00:26:58.964]  You've completely... I was hundreds of yards away from Josh Owens on the other side of the border, and he's watching out for me, but I felt like I was on the other side of the world, all alone, that if something happened there and he watched, there's nothing he could do.
[00:26:59.024 --> 00:27:02.066]  And I want to be clear, if anybody does... I grew up in Texas, so I know about this.
[00:27:02.106 --> 00:27:03.387]  You were stationed down there, so you know.
[00:27:03.647 --> 00:27:08.831]  They have found hundreds of mass graves, sometimes 100, 200 people in them, including kids.
[00:27:09.551 --> 00:27:13.313]  I mean, this is the most insane death zone, but it's hardly in the media.
[00:27:13.713 --> 00:27:14.573]  They play it down.
[00:27:14.873 --> 00:27:16.294]  Go ahead.
[00:27:16.354 --> 00:27:23.057]  The thing that was scary is being out there, being a gringo in a truck with American plates, riding through an opera.
[00:27:23.837 --> 00:27:28.019]  You know, everyone's looking at us, just cartel spotters on every corner with a cell phone just watching you.
[00:27:28.379 --> 00:27:29.980]  Every little move you make, what you're doing.
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.001]  Every time groups of people would walk by, I would just try to put my head down.
[00:27:34.522 --> 00:27:37.724]  You know, put my main camera down, just had the GoPros going.
[00:27:38.124 --> 00:27:44.328]  I mean, it's one of those areas, if something would have went wrong, one of those guys would have just felt suspicious, any, with us being there.
[00:27:44.348 --> 00:27:45.769]  I mean, that would have been in my head, literally.
[00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:47.190]  And what's the name of the video?
[00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:51.073]  It's InfoWars Reporters go into an opera.
[00:27:51.093 --> 00:27:52.794]  We can roll some of that footage while you talk.
[00:27:53.074 --> 00:27:53.875]  This is just amazing.
[00:27:54.375 --> 00:27:59.079]  Yeah, like I said, I mean, there was just dead carcasses, like animals and stuff on the side of the road.
[00:27:59.119 --> 00:28:00.720]  I mean, it was just like being in Iraq.
[00:28:01.041 --> 00:28:02.202]  It smelled like rotten eggs.
[00:28:02.722 --> 00:28:05.685]  And there was this huge compound with concertina wire on the top.
[00:28:06.025 --> 00:28:07.806]  We saw that mosque-looking building as well.
[00:28:08.787 --> 00:28:14.412]  There was one of the huge cartel houses that I didn't know was a cartel house until after I spoke with FBI.
[00:28:14.732 --> 00:28:16.113]  And they said that's like a very
[00:28:17.074 --> 00:28:18.315]  We're good to go.
[00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:33.430]  Yeah, we flew over those areas, too.
[00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:36.051]  I mean, there's always a chance someone could take pop shots at you, too.
[00:28:36.671 --> 00:28:46.896]  Josh had read an article where the Mexican government, you know, had ordered people to, like, shoot down planes that come over Mexico because sometimes they think they're, like, cartel planes taking drugs, so they start shooting them down.
[00:28:47.096 --> 00:28:47.856]  No, there's no doubt.
[00:28:47.976 --> 00:28:51.417]  The only other place that may be as dangerous as one sector on the Guatemala-Mexico board.
[00:28:51.537 --> 00:28:54.818]  Because I've had professors on that have written books on the hot zones.
[00:28:54.858 --> 00:28:57.619]  That is the hot of the hot of the hot.
[00:28:58.139 --> 00:29:02.100]  Over 100,000 people dead, total we know about, and a huge portion of them right there.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:07.242]  We're going to come back, talk about your meeting with the FBI counterterrorism unit at the airport.
[00:29:07.522 --> 00:29:08.562]  When we come back, stay with us.
[00:29:10.117 --> 00:29:11.358]  I want more candy!
[00:29:11.378 --> 00:29:12.098]  I want more video games!
[00:29:12.259 --> 00:29:12.339]  Mine!
[00:29:12.399 --> 00:29:13.239]  Mine!
[00:29:13.259 --> 00:29:13.359]  Mine!
[00:29:39.997 --> 00:29:40.878]  That's right.
[00:30:10.038 --> 00:30:11.738]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[00:30:11.998 --> 00:30:15.759]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:30:16.219 --> 00:30:20.560]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:27.461]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[00:30:27.982 --> 00:30:35.503]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular
[00:30:35.503 --> 00:30:35.723]  I'm good.

[00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:10.815]  Another major health threat.
[00:32:10.855 --> 00:32:15.757]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:32:15.817 --> 00:32:18.458]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:32:18.498 --> 00:32:25.260]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:32:25.541 --> 00:32:28.402]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:32:28.542 --> 00:32:31.463]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:32:31.483 --> 00:32:33.464]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:32:33.504 --> 00:32:36.325]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:32:36.425 --> 00:32:41.927]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:32:42.147 --> 00:32:45.628]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:32:45.648 --> 00:32:48.649]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[00:33:07.595 --> 00:33:15.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:19.823 --> 00:33:20.404]  An opera.
[00:33:20.464 --> 00:33:21.064]  Another world.
[00:33:21.124 --> 00:33:21.745]  Another time.
[00:33:21.805 --> 00:33:22.865]  In the age of wonder.
[00:33:38.027 --> 00:33:38.928]  Another time.
[00:33:38.948 --> 00:33:46.731]  His life was green and good until the crystal cracked.
[00:33:46.851 --> 00:33:50.773]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:51.474 --> 00:33:57.537]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:08.648]  So, you have these no-man's lands where the cartels control things like an opera right across the border from El Paso.
[00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:21.473]  And there's no grocery stores, there's no shops, there's no nothing because the cartels want to push all normal activity out, the police, the military out, and totally control it.
[00:34:21.853 --> 00:34:22.974]  That's where Joe Biggs went.
[00:34:24.298 --> 00:34:25.579]  Then the FBI wanted to question him.
[00:34:25.979 --> 00:34:26.720]  Why were we there?
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:37.768]  Because judicial watch that I've been covering for 20 years, it's about 19 years old, has been very accurate over and over again and they said that there is a training camp over the border hidden in that area.
[00:34:37.808 --> 00:34:48.135]  We found aerial shots of guys in trucks and eight guys marching in black uniforms and weird looking mosque and we're just drawing attention to this so it gets investigated more because ISIS
[00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:52.050]  Has been threatening us through Facebook, Twitter.
[00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:57.611]  They've launched new attacks in Iraq, in other areas today, in Libya.
[00:34:57.791 --> 00:35:00.312]  700 people just drowned trying to get out of Libya because of them.
[00:35:00.832 --> 00:35:02.213]  We're going to talk about that in the next segment.
[00:35:02.253 --> 00:35:06.894]  I mean, Al-Qaeda was like a made-up force the West was funding and protecting.
[00:35:07.154 --> 00:35:13.976]  They were real jihadis, but the globals were feeding them like rabid dogs at a distance to then attack America so they could take our freedoms.
[00:35:14.416 --> 00:35:17.177]  But ISIS is taking over major countries.
[00:35:18.533 --> 00:35:20.194]  Shipping lanes, uh, ports.
[00:35:21.654 --> 00:35:28.937]  So, we're in Texas, we'd be crazy when Joe Biggs was stationed down there at Fort Bliss and we have contacts and the Border Patrol would not go down there.
[00:35:28.957 --> 00:35:29.857]  That's what real journalists do.
[00:35:30.237 --> 00:35:31.177]  Nobody else does that.
[00:35:32.158 --> 00:35:35.939]  And I mean nobody, but Vice might go into some more internal stuff that's really nothing.
[00:35:36.279 --> 00:35:37.900]  I'm not saying Vice doesn't do some bold stuff.
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:42.401]  They've been hit with rubber bullets with our reporters, like Joe, you know, up in Ferguson just covering it.
[00:35:42.421 --> 00:35:43.482]  We weren't even anti-police.
[00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:51.514]  Then I see the commenters, it's a minority of them on Infowars.com, you know, going, oh, it's not dangerous, big deal.
[00:35:51.674 --> 00:35:53.836]  Let me tell you, the FBI wouldn't go in there.
[00:35:54.516 --> 00:35:55.677]  Plus, they don't have jurisdiction.
[00:35:56.157 --> 00:35:57.779]  This is extremely dangerous.
[00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:03.362]  Mexico has the highest crime rate in the world, and then you're in the hot zone of the hot zone.
[00:36:03.382 --> 00:36:07.745]  So, Joe, describe going in for folks a little bit more, and let's get into the FBI.
[00:36:08.726 --> 00:36:12.128]  Yeah, when you go in there, it's just complete and total just chaos.
[00:36:12.168 --> 00:36:14.190]  You know, the traffic, how everything is.
[00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:15.070]  Everyone's just rushing.
[00:36:15.991 --> 00:36:20.414]  Me and my guide almost saw two little kids just murdered by a bus driver.
[00:36:21.115 --> 00:36:21.895]  They just don't care.
[00:36:21.915 --> 00:36:22.676]  They were just driving.
[00:36:22.696 --> 00:36:24.397]  Little kid was out on the road playing.
[00:36:24.777 --> 00:36:27.039]  And this bus just swerved around me and my guy.
[00:36:27.439 --> 00:36:31.402]  And the little five-year-old girl barely grabbed that boy and pulled him just within inches of his life.
[00:36:31.422 --> 00:36:34.023]  That would have just been a murdered two kids right there on the ground.
[00:36:34.464 --> 00:36:35.304]  No one would have done anything.
[00:36:35.344 --> 00:36:36.025]  No one would have known.
[00:36:36.465 --> 00:36:37.227]  So it's anarchy.
[00:36:37.247 --> 00:36:41.477]  We're showing people being shot at a grocery store for no reason right now by the cartels.
[00:36:41.598 --> 00:36:43.603]  Yeah, I mean, it's complete and total lawlessness.
[00:36:43.663 --> 00:36:44.605]  It's just crazy out there.
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:51.442]  And, you know, you get out there and it's just being completely alone.
[00:36:51.642 --> 00:36:56.063]  Even though, like I said, I was hundreds of yards away from Josh Owens, I felt like I was all alone.
[00:36:56.423 --> 00:37:02.925]  It was scarier than being in Iraq in the sense that in Iraq I at least had a gun, I at least could defend myself, and I had a group of people.
[00:37:03.245 --> 00:37:10.908]  Here I am, one person sticking out like a sore thumb, a white boy in an opera Mexico with no gun, armed with only a camera and a cell phone.
[00:37:10.948 --> 00:37:12.048]  You know, that's pretty intense.
[00:37:12.728 --> 00:37:14.049]  So the FBI calls
[00:37:16.001 --> 00:37:17.782]  The truck you went in with, break that down.
[00:37:18.782 --> 00:37:26.264]  Yeah, so Saturday morning, I am coming back from the East Portillo Mountains with Josh.
[00:37:26.324 --> 00:37:27.264]  We'd been out there filming.
[00:37:27.324 --> 00:37:30.705]  That was the area where they said they had those ISIS spotters up in the mountains.
[00:37:30.725 --> 00:37:33.546]  So we went out there, drove about an hour and a half, went out there and checked it out.
[00:37:34.166 --> 00:37:43.049]  I get back into El Paso and we're just kind of, you know, going over articles, just kind of like wasting time until it's time to get on the aircraft and, you know, fly back this way.
[00:37:43.729 --> 00:37:47.590]  I get a message on my phone, and it's a guy who said, hey, have you seen this new video?
[00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:49.591]  You're in this new ISIS video.
[00:37:50.251 --> 00:37:51.271]  So I'm like, wow, that's crazy.
[00:37:51.291 --> 00:37:51.892]  So I look at it.
[00:37:52.012 --> 00:37:53.072]  We haven't even gotten to that part yet.
[00:37:53.092 --> 00:37:53.312]  Yeah.
[00:37:53.592 --> 00:37:55.773]  You're now in the official ISIS website.
[00:37:55.853 --> 00:37:57.013]  So I get this video.
[00:37:57.874 --> 00:38:00.974]  Twenty minutes later, we finish eating, and I get a call.
[00:38:00.994 --> 00:38:04.135]  You're now featured in the video that's nationwide, worldwide news.
[00:38:04.376 --> 00:38:05.236]  We will burn America.
[00:38:05.376 --> 00:38:05.536]  Yeah.
[00:38:06.983 --> 00:38:11.605]  So, 20 minutes later I get this call and it's the, uh, my buddy who drove me over into Mexico.
[00:38:11.665 --> 00:38:16.026]  He goes, hey, you know how I told you last night that, uh, someone called and they were looking for you?
[00:38:16.466 --> 00:38:17.967]  He says, I just got a call again.
[00:38:18.027 --> 00:38:19.267]  They said it's the FBI.
[00:38:19.307 --> 00:38:22.788]  They want to know, uh, where you're at and, uh, you know, what you're doing.
[00:38:23.348 --> 00:38:26.349]  So at first I was kind of like, uh, okay, this is a little intense.
[00:38:26.369 --> 00:38:26.589]  All right.
[00:38:26.629 --> 00:38:27.610]  The FBI is calling me.
[00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:27.850]  All right.
[00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:42.425]  And I'm sitting there thinking to myself, I said, alright, well, send me his name, his number, and I'm going to contact the FBI field office here in El Paso, find out if this is a name that actually is... Well, you called me and I said check their name, and I also said they probably really want to know what you saw.
[00:38:42.965 --> 00:38:45.428]  Yeah, I mean, and at the end of the day, that's what they were really interested in.
[00:38:45.488 --> 00:38:48.531]  Like you said earlier, FBI doesn't have the jurisdiction to go over there, they don't have...
[00:38:49.232 --> 00:38:55.118]  They've got all that red tape that doesn't allow them to go in there, and they were wanting to know why someone like me would go over there.
[00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:57.441]  And I said, hey, El Paso's like a second home to me.
[00:38:57.481 --> 00:39:00.404]  I have a lot of friends that are like family in that town.
[00:39:00.444 --> 00:39:07.752]  If these guys come over, these jokers, these ISIS, come across these wide open borders, and they start doing terrorist attacks on Fort Bliss, I'm gonna be pissed off.
[00:39:08.976 --> 00:39:11.979]  Especially if I didn't go do something and, you know, help bring awareness to this.
[00:39:12.019 --> 00:39:14.682]  Yeah, these are the very jihadis you've been fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:39:14.702 --> 00:39:20.308]  Yeah, you know, and the fact that these guys, you know, it takes me to go over there to go look to see what's going on.
[00:39:20.508 --> 00:39:22.631]  You know, I know they've got ways they can get over in there.
[00:39:23.031 --> 00:39:24.653]  Judicial Watch is very credible.
[00:39:24.693 --> 00:39:25.554]  That's why we went down there.
[00:39:25.754 --> 00:39:26.915]  Yeah, so, exactly.
[00:39:26.935 --> 00:39:27.635]  The FBI said that.
[00:39:27.835 --> 00:39:28.195]  They agreed.
[00:39:28.295 --> 00:39:32.177]  Yeah, so I'm talking to the field agent and he's counter-terrorism.
[00:39:32.237 --> 00:39:34.718]  He asked not to have his name said or anything like that.
[00:39:34.738 --> 00:39:40.340]  But Josh, Josh sat in on the meeting with me and there was another guy as well that didn't really talk much.
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.341]  He just kind of listened in.
[00:39:41.701 --> 00:39:42.822]  But I checked his credentials.
[00:39:42.882 --> 00:39:43.602]  Everything was legit.
[00:39:44.082 --> 00:39:45.603]  And he goes, hey, so what is your interest?
[00:39:46.388 --> 00:39:46.888]  Why?
[00:39:47.549 --> 00:39:49.090]  Why are you looking into this?
[00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.171]  And I said, well, how long have you been watching my videos?
[00:39:51.632 --> 00:39:53.553]  And he goes, well, I've been watching your videos for a while.
[00:39:53.613 --> 00:39:55.354]  You know, he said, I watch your live feed.
[00:39:55.734 --> 00:39:56.995]  I watch you while you're in Mexico.
[00:39:57.055 --> 00:39:59.237]  We were all watching to see if you would find anything.
[00:39:59.257 --> 00:40:02.959]  You know, we were we're very interested in your research and what you were doing.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.181]  And I said, well, that's the answer to this question.
[00:40:05.681 --> 00:40:06.542]  Yeah, I said so.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:19.763]  I said the reason I went down there was based off the Judicial Watch report and he goes yeah yeah he's like we we you know we call them very credible sources we anything they write about we definitely look into because it always turns out to be true.
[00:40:20.304 --> 00:40:21.104]  Yeah that's what we found.
[00:40:21.544 --> 00:40:31.047]  Yeah I mean he said they're 99.9% of the time accurate on everything they write about and he says the reason is they get so many details.
[00:40:31.787 --> 00:40:32.247]  On things.
[00:40:32.648 --> 00:40:36.490]  You know, they're so detailed in their articles about the specifics of locations and all that.
[00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:42.933]  That's when they started looking into Judicial Watch and then saw that these guys are credible when they started checking those sources as well.
[00:40:44.014 --> 00:40:46.475]  Well, Judicial Watch almost brought down Clinton and a lot of others.
[00:40:46.495 --> 00:40:48.796]  They had a lot of good people in government feed them info.
[00:40:49.177 --> 00:40:51.298]  And then Judicial Watch is a bunch of highbrow lawyers.
[00:40:51.338 --> 00:40:53.259]  They don't go with it until they've double-checked it.
[00:40:54.479 --> 00:40:56.621]  They're the ones that broke the North American Union documents.
[00:40:56.801 --> 00:40:56.881]  No.
[00:40:58.001 --> 00:41:01.102]  The Saudi connection to 9-11, the stand-down order?
[00:41:01.443 --> 00:41:04.724]  That was Judicial Watch, not me when I was getting called the 9-11 truther and all that.
[00:41:05.404 --> 00:41:07.565]  I mean, the government did stand down.
[00:41:07.605 --> 00:41:08.866]  Judicial Watch got the documents.
[00:41:09.766 --> 00:41:10.867]  Doesn't mean the whole government did it.
[00:41:10.947 --> 00:41:11.847]  Criminals did that.
[00:41:13.168 --> 00:41:16.970]  So, I can't tell you how many hundreds of times Judicial Watch has been accurate.
[00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:26.594]  Well, listen, you know, this is what real journalism is, Joe, and we're just trying to draw attention down there, so if there is an ISIS threat down there, it will be exposed.
[00:41:27.423 --> 00:41:30.506]  I mean, he told me that I had bigger balls, I would say, than anybody ever.
[00:41:30.726 --> 00:41:32.207]  He said that they would never go in there.
[00:41:32.227 --> 00:41:41.396]  He said the fact that, he said one of the main reasons they had so many people watching was just the fact that if something went wrong, you know, I could have lost my head, Colombian necktie, cut through here, ripped out the bottom.
[00:41:41.836 --> 00:41:46.040]  He said they were literally worried about the safety of me at the time.
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:51.465]  Sure, politically, if you got hurt, Obama wants the border to look like it's all pretty and happy.
[00:41:52.125 --> 00:41:54.447]  And there's no crime and oh, it's so wonderful.
[00:41:54.848 --> 00:41:55.428]  Exactly.
[00:41:55.709 --> 00:41:57.751]  By you going down there, you spotlight that.
[00:41:58.552 --> 00:42:04.117]  Yeah, you know, and Josh Owens at the same time was able to talk to a Border Patrol agent on the other side of the border, on the U.S.
[00:42:04.137 --> 00:42:05.418]  side, when I was over in Mexico.
[00:42:05.879 --> 00:42:13.286]  And this guy is saying, yeah, you know, at night time, this area right here, the Cristo Rey Mountains, is the most trafficked spot in the entire border.
[00:42:13.306 --> 00:42:15.949]  They pick up over 2,000 other than Mexicans a month.
[00:42:16.449 --> 00:42:25.274]  On that spot, the spots where we were walking, where we filmed trenches, where you could just, it's like double overhead, you could walk down in these trenches and no one, even in a helicopter, would ever see you.
[00:42:25.294 --> 00:42:26.135]  And they do it at night time.
[00:42:26.155 --> 00:42:27.816]  So many canyons where it floods in.
[00:42:27.836 --> 00:42:28.596]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:28.716 --> 00:42:33.980]  And you said that it's not unusual at night time to hear gunfire, you know, the coyotes shooting if someone doesn't pay.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.543]  Oh yeah, if the people don't pay the full price or get shaken down, whole families are killed and buried in pits.
[00:42:39.703 --> 00:42:42.024]  I mean, that is so evil.
[00:42:42.605 --> 00:42:42.865]  But then,
[00:42:44.235 --> 00:42:48.039]  Rodriguez makes movies where Don Johnson's one burying the Mexicans.
[00:42:48.359 --> 00:42:49.540]  No, it's the cartels.
[00:42:50.201 --> 00:42:52.082]  Not Don Johnson in Machete.
[00:42:53.184 --> 00:42:55.806]  I wish Machete in that movie was killing the cartels, but notice he's not.
[00:42:56.046 --> 00:42:57.187]  Yeah.
[00:42:57.227 --> 00:42:59.690]  I mean, you gotta look at it from all kinds of different angles as well, though.
[00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.611]  I mean, look at all these illegals who come over here.
[00:43:01.631 --> 00:43:02.052]  What do they do?
[00:43:02.512 --> 00:43:04.855]  They get a Willy Wonka golden ticket to everything.
[00:43:05.375 --> 00:43:05.735]  Stay there.
[00:43:05.755 --> 00:43:07.777]  I wanna break this down with you and tie it into Libya.
[00:43:07.797 --> 00:43:08.198]  Stay with us.
[00:43:09.969 --> 00:43:12.050]  Do you know what it means to be an American?
[00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:13.511]  It's more than a flag.
[00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:16.452]  It's more than knowing the star-spangled banner.
[00:43:16.652 --> 00:43:18.013]  It's knowing the Constitution.
[00:43:18.233 --> 00:43:21.114]  It's understanding those rights and fighting for them.
[00:43:21.314 --> 00:43:27.858]  Our country is falling apart because people have forgotten to fight, to stand up in the face of tyranny and do the right thing.
[00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:30.619]  It's putting your life on the line to protect your country.
[00:43:30.779 --> 00:43:33.140]  from enemies both foreign and domestic.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:40.905]  The Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and no government should refuse or rest on inference.
[00:43:41.445 --> 00:43:46.448]  So the Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[00:43:47.268 --> 00:43:51.752]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com, and I believe our flag is more than cloth and ink.
[00:43:52.192 --> 00:43:54.894]  It is a symbol that stands for liberty and freedom.
[00:43:55.274 --> 00:43:59.938]  It is the history of our nation, and it's marked by the blood of those who died defending it.
[00:44:00.418 --> 00:44:02.119]  So join me in this Infowar.
[00:44:02.159 --> 00:44:06.603]  Turn off your TV, put your Cheetos down, get off your butt and join the resistance.

[00:45:02.053 --> 00:45:03.815]  Something the globalists are targeting.

[00:45:18.026 --> 00:45:19.787]  This is Homeland Security.

[00:45:21.647 --> 00:45:23.587]  Building independent media operations.
[00:45:23.627 --> 00:45:28.588]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:45:28.628 --> 00:45:29.588]  Crime Directive.
[00:45:29.648 --> 00:45:31.129]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:45:31.189 --> 00:45:34.029]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:45:34.049 --> 00:45:37.110]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:39.470]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:41.090]  People are assaulting us.
[00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:43.391]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:45:43.952 --> 00:45:45.592]  They are never going to stop.
[00:45:45.912 --> 00:45:49.814]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:45:56.896 --> 00:45:57.636]  Imperative.
[00:45:57.897 --> 00:45:59.897]  Destroy Britain's T.V.
[00:45:59.917 --> 00:46:04.319]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:46:04.599 --> 00:46:05.959]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:46:05.979 --> 00:46:06.720]  You can feel it.
[00:46:09.845 --> 00:46:10.766]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:46:10.926 --> 00:46:18.613]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lift weights 5 days a week, I can swim 2-3 miles.
[00:46:18.973 --> 00:46:21.896]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[00:46:22.136 --> 00:46:23.717]  I started an access television show.
[00:46:24.098 --> 00:46:28.882]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[00:46:29.482 --> 00:46:32.325]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[00:46:32.845 --> 00:46:38.569]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a Jabba the Hutt.
[00:46:38.929 --> 00:46:43.772]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[00:46:44.172 --> 00:46:49.055]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[00:46:49.335 --> 00:46:56.440]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Group for Infowarslife.com, the results were incredible.
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:01.884]  Take the Infowarslife.com challenge today at Infowarslife.com or give our crew a call.
[00:47:02.084 --> 00:47:05.046]  They can answer all your questions or tell you about any of the specials at 888-253-3139.
[00:47:05.066 --> 00:47:07.048]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.663 --> 00:47:24.666]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:47:25.246 --> 00:47:29.450]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:34.755 --> 00:47:37.838]  Alex Jones here, live, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:37.878 --> 00:47:41.321]  Joe Biggs, Infowars.com reporter, is in studio with us.
[00:47:43.007 --> 00:47:55.235]  I want to shift gears and connect this whole ISIS situation with the rest of the world and tie it into EU leaders' call for emergency talks after 700 migrants drowned off Libya here in just a moment.
[00:47:55.775 --> 00:48:04.761]  But before we go any further, we're running a bunch of different specials at Infowarsstore.com right now and Infowarslife.com right now.
[00:48:05.322 --> 00:48:07.123]  We built this media operation.
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:12.401]  Because you supported us to spread the word and support our sponsors.
[00:48:13.281 --> 00:48:20.343]  And predominantly, that was the films I produced, the t-shirts, the books, the videos we carry at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:48:20.743 --> 00:48:27.805]  Highest quality, gravity-fed, filters that cut out the glyphosates, the fluoride, the rest of the garbage, 10% off, promo code WATER.
[00:48:28.465 --> 00:48:31.266]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:48:31.526 --> 00:48:34.087]  But we're running right now, and it ends this month,
[00:48:34.935 --> 00:48:36.036]  Some of the biggest specials.
[00:48:36.096 --> 00:48:41.483]  In fact, the biggest special we've ever had on colloidal silver.
[00:48:41.503 --> 00:48:42.844]  50% off.
[00:48:43.905 --> 00:48:44.666]  Silver bullet.
[00:48:46.749 --> 00:48:47.530]  High quality.
[00:48:49.801 --> 00:48:54.743]  Nano size, 300 parts per million, silver for $14.95.
[00:48:54.783 --> 00:49:00.065]  The exact same silver is $29.95 at places like Whole Foods and other installations.
[00:49:00.685 --> 00:49:04.266]  So again, you can get it half off right now.
[00:49:04.306 --> 00:49:12.389]  If you get two bottles of Silver Bullet, you can get a free bottle of Fluoride Shield, a detoxing key later as well.
[00:49:12.809 --> 00:49:17.311]  That's just one of the specials available right now at Infowars.
[00:49:18.553 --> 00:49:21.675]  Life.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:49:22.195 --> 00:49:23.736]  And we have some other specials as well.
[00:49:24.856 --> 00:49:37.163]  We have the Alex Jones Challenge Pack that is the OxyPower that flushes out your intestines, the high-level oxygen, the X2 Nacin Iodine, the SuperMill Vitality.
[00:49:37.623 --> 00:49:41.806]  All three products together, free shipping, or buy them individually, free shipping.
[00:49:42.046 --> 00:49:46.068]  You can also get two bottles of Nacin Iodine X2 and get a free bottle.
[00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:52.238]  On top of that, of the fluoride shield chelator that pulls the heavy metals out of your blood.
[00:49:52.298 --> 00:49:54.902]  And again, most people are iodine deficient.
[00:49:54.942 --> 00:49:55.743]  It's the good halogen.
[00:49:55.983 --> 00:49:59.308]  They have the bad halogens of fluoride and other stuff in their thyroid.
[00:50:00.359 --> 00:50:04.961]  Personally, what's done for me and what group said it would do is detox, energy, you name it.
[00:50:05.341 --> 00:50:06.162]  Just try it.
[00:50:06.722 --> 00:50:08.003]  You've heard the rave reviews.
[00:50:08.423 --> 00:50:11.864]  Bottom line, your purchase supports the transmission and what we're doing here.
[00:50:12.205 --> 00:50:15.226]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:50:15.806 --> 00:50:20.929]  I want to thank you all for your amazing support as well.
[00:50:21.329 --> 00:50:23.770]  Again, that's Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:50:29.468 --> 00:50:34.211]  When I see a news story like this, I begin to connect the dots to what's previously happened.
[00:50:34.971 --> 00:50:39.114]  Hillary Clinton, four and a half years ago, said bombarding with U.S.
[00:50:39.194 --> 00:50:41.676]  and NATO air power Libya was the thing to do.
[00:50:42.516 --> 00:50:48.600]  Qaddafi was a tyrant, and freedom fighters out of eastern Libya were wonderful people.
[00:50:49.961 --> 00:50:56.585]  We pointed out they flew Al-Qaeda flags, they wanted an Islamic State, they were funded by Saudi Arabia,
[00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:00.154]  The country is now admittedly a failed state.
[00:51:00.515 --> 00:51:02.539]  They've killed over 60,000 people.
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:07.609]  Black Africans in their own continent are not welcomed by the racist jihadis.
[00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:18.437]  If you read some of the Quranic passages about black folks, it really makes you wonder just in the interpretation about why so many people think Christianity is racist when there's no text.
[00:51:18.497 --> 00:51:27.843]  But the point is, EU leaders call for emergency talks after 700 migrants drowned off Libya Reuters.
[00:51:29.488 --> 00:51:42.020]  As many as 700 people feared dead after a fishing boat packed with migrants capsizes off the Libyan coast overnight when officials say it may be the Mediterranean's worst disaster as thousands flee poverty and war to Europe.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:50.609]  Now, normally I'd say, hey Africa, you're having a bunch of kids, you want to get to Italy that has welfare way down the state?
[00:51:52.136 --> 00:51:53.398]  Italy's totally bankrupt.
[00:51:53.558 --> 00:51:58.726]  The big bankers want to legalize you to come there, to be a political bloc, to be dependent.
[00:51:59.047 --> 00:52:00.128]  I'd be against it, but...
[00:52:01.872 --> 00:52:12.917]  Western governments went into Libya, the most stable country in Africa, that was stabilizing all of Africa, and Gaddafi worked with the West for eight years, he was letting Western investment come in.
[00:52:13.417 --> 00:52:25.903]  They betrayed him, they set him up, they killed him in the street, and now they've turned it over to Islamic State ISIS, who's using it as a base to attack all over the Middle East, and now
[00:52:27.366 --> 00:52:55.619]  The media's come out and said, we've got to have a task force, and we've now got to basically let anybody who wants to leave Africa come to Europe, see how they create the crisis, and offer the solution, and then you don't want to say no to these poor Libyans, who the West is wrong, but at the same time, the very globalists that destabilized Libya, are now going to use them to destabilize Italy, and the rest of Europe, which Islamic State has said they will do, with these very migrants, Joe Biggs.
[00:52:55.899 --> 00:52:57.641]  Well, Yemen's also collapsing as well.
[00:52:57.922 --> 00:53:00.766]  And all those people are flooding from Yemen over into Djibouti as well.
[00:53:01.066 --> 00:53:02.648]  So that's what's going to happen from there.
[00:53:02.668 --> 00:53:04.791]  They're going to leave and flee over into Europe as well.
[00:53:04.891 --> 00:53:06.173]  A destabilization program.
[00:53:06.193 --> 00:53:06.713]  Break it down.
[00:53:06.754 --> 00:53:07.535]  How do we counter this?
[00:53:09.028 --> 00:53:10.850]  Like I said, we cut the funding off.
[00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:11.571]  I mean, that's the thing.
[00:53:11.611 --> 00:53:12.612]  We keep funding these people.
[00:53:12.632 --> 00:53:13.033]  That's right.
[00:53:13.073 --> 00:53:14.594]  We don't care what goes on.
[00:53:15.015 --> 00:53:17.077]  Like Rand Paul says, we don't fund any of it.
[00:53:17.277 --> 00:53:22.263]  Because the funding always only makes it worse, because special interests want to keep the crisis going.
[00:53:22.483 --> 00:53:27.229]  We've funded them so much, they're now able to take over these oil refineries, airfields, all these different places.
[00:53:27.249 --> 00:53:28.330]  They're taking over- Shipyards.
[00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:34.592]  Just murdering people by the thousands, gruesome beheadings, you know, executions.
[00:53:34.632 --> 00:53:36.052]  I mean, this is out of control.
[00:53:36.392 --> 00:53:44.194]  And we've allowed them, by funding them, to continue to grow so much that they have gotten beyond, you know, the government's power.
[00:53:44.254 --> 00:53:48.596]  Because, you know, the government, the Obama administration, like I've said before in the past, is Dr. Frankenstein.
[00:53:49.176 --> 00:53:50.556]  ISIS is the monster they created.
[00:53:50.596 --> 00:53:52.337]  These guys have gotten so big, out of control.
[00:53:52.417 --> 00:53:54.257]  Oh yeah, no, no, they're not controlled by the West.
[00:53:54.277 --> 00:53:56.378]  They were birthed and funded and suckled.
[00:53:57.461 --> 00:54:01.043]  And, I mean, we've got to stop doing these accidental airdrops.
[00:54:01.704 --> 00:54:02.805]  I know people in the Air Force.
[00:54:02.825 --> 00:54:03.985]  They take their jobs seriously.
[00:54:04.025 --> 00:54:06.047]  They don't accidentally miss a target.
[00:54:06.087 --> 00:54:06.887]  They hit their target.
[00:54:06.907 --> 00:54:08.529]  Well, that's what the President of Iraq said.
[00:54:08.569 --> 00:54:10.430]  He said, the West is funding Al-Qaeda.
[00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:14.973]  Yeah, they- Because two years ago, the military wouldn't go along with resupplying them, so now it's accidents.
[00:54:15.273 --> 00:54:21.677]  Yeah, they train and train to hit their marks, to drop their packages where they're supposed to go, and they keep saying these are accidental drops.
[00:54:21.737 --> 00:54:23.098]  I don't believe that whatsoever.
[00:54:23.338 --> 00:54:24.399]  These guys purposely do it.
[00:54:24.659 --> 00:54:29.923]  Now, the Air Force pilots are probably being told, hey, this is a rebel stronghold, you know, these are the guys who are trying to fight ISIS.
[00:54:30.263 --> 00:54:32.645]  This is where you need to drop it, not knowing from that high up.
[00:54:32.665 --> 00:54:34.546]  That's how compartmentalization works.
[00:54:34.706 --> 00:54:39.149]  They tell these guys they're dropping it off in a good area, and then you see some ISIS propaganda video coming out.
[00:54:39.369 --> 00:54:43.873]  And they're opening up US, you know, crates with grenades and, you know, RPGs and all this stuff.
[00:54:43.893 --> 00:54:45.294]  I mean, it's out of control.
[00:54:45.674 --> 00:54:48.556]  And people are dying because we keep and continue funding them.
[00:54:48.856 --> 00:54:49.357]  I agree.
[00:54:49.797 --> 00:54:52.459]  And I believe it's exposing compartmentalization.
[00:54:52.479 --> 00:54:56.583]  Because the average person in the FBI or the military or a corporation is not bad.
[00:54:56.963 --> 00:54:59.985]  It's that the top-down disinformation is what's happening.
[00:55:00.065 --> 00:55:00.225]  Yeah.
[00:55:02.659 --> 00:55:09.182]  A psychological warfare that they push out to the masses, and then there's a psychological warfare that they use against their own troops.
[00:55:10.242 --> 00:55:11.923]  And that's how they get these people to do stuff.
[00:55:12.383 --> 00:55:12.724]  That's right.
[00:55:12.744 --> 00:55:16.725]  There's disinfo on the public, but also another brand of it internally on the military.
[00:55:16.745 --> 00:55:17.166]  Exactly.
[00:55:17.186 --> 00:55:26.530]  I mean, when you go through different stages in military training, like ANOC and all this stuff, Advanced Noncommissioned Officer School, and all this different training, they teach you
[00:55:27.679 --> 00:55:34.201]  To essentially fool these soldiers into just doing stuff and becoming robots and just listening to what you say and not thinking for themselves.
[00:55:35.141 --> 00:55:36.422]  That's what they train people to do.
[00:55:36.502 --> 00:55:50.186]  When they get older and they get higher up in ranks, it's easier for the political guys who are like Master Sergeants, Sergeant Majors, all this, to kind of go ahead and start trickling in down to these Staff Sergeants and say, listen to this, this is the truth, just go with it.
[00:55:50.767 --> 00:55:52.347]  Tell your guys this is what's going on.
[00:55:52.487 --> 00:55:54.548]  And the more you BS, the higher you rise up.
[00:55:55.188 --> 00:55:58.951]  And then we're just putting a headline up where Sony won't even block on their platforms, ISIS.
[00:55:59.371 --> 00:56:01.032]  Neither will Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.
[00:56:01.132 --> 00:56:02.453]  But we get censored all the time.
[00:56:02.473 --> 00:56:07.256]  Yeah, Facebook wants to have a button that's going to tell users whether or not something is fake news or not.
[00:56:07.596 --> 00:56:09.578]  But meanwhile, they're going to allow this stuff.
[00:56:09.738 --> 00:56:10.038]  That's right.
[00:56:10.058 --> 00:56:14.641]  They're going to let users vote down or ban content because they claim it's not true.
[00:56:14.761 --> 00:56:19.224]  If I go into Mexico illegally, and I get captured by the Mexican government, what's going to happen?
[00:56:19.244 --> 00:56:20.465]  I'm going to be like Andrew Tamorsi.
[00:56:20.746 --> 00:56:22.747]  I'm going to be locked up in prison for a long time.
[00:56:22.787 --> 00:56:24.909]  What happens when these guys come over to our country?
[00:56:25.149 --> 00:56:31.354]  We let them, we get them bus tickets, we get them to go to school, we give them health care, we give them a free ticket to everything out there.
[00:56:32.054 --> 00:56:33.235]  And there's nothing for them to worry about.
[00:56:33.355 --> 00:56:38.820]  ISIS can literally just walk across the border and come in and start terrorizing people, and we're more of a threat.
[00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:39.620]  The camera's on us.
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:40.421]  The target is on us.
[00:56:40.641 --> 00:56:41.762]  Let me ask you this question.
[00:56:42.523 --> 00:56:54.453]  If they bait and switch after 9-11, use 9-11 to take our freedoms, if they do let ISIS come across and attack, but the borders fill open, won't that backfire and cause a call for the border to be secured?
[00:56:56.035 --> 00:57:02.298]  I mean, at that point, if they start doing these lone wolf attacks and all these different cells start popping off, I mean, people aren't even going to be worried about the border at that point in time.
[00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:06.381]  Because if something happens in the middle... That's right, they'll just spin it and ignore that.
[00:57:06.541 --> 00:57:08.462]  But if something happens in the middle of the country, what happens?
[00:57:08.742 --> 00:57:11.984]  All our focus goes away from the north and south border to the middle of the state.
[00:57:12.024 --> 00:57:14.045]  And there'll be no discussion on why was the border wide open?
[00:57:14.165 --> 00:57:14.285]  Yeah.
[00:57:14.778 --> 00:57:15.199]  Exactly.
[00:57:15.239 --> 00:57:19.164]  Everybody's going to wonder what happened in Oklahoma, what happened in the middle of the country somewhere.
[00:57:19.184 --> 00:57:22.167]  No one's going to be looking at the South and saying, hey, our borders are wide open.
[00:57:22.207 --> 00:57:23.950]  They're going to be like, oh my God, this place just got hit.
[00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:26.473]  Yeah, there's definitely major forces moving quick.
[00:57:26.513 --> 00:57:28.175]  Joe Biggs, great job in Mexico.
[00:57:28.515 --> 00:57:29.657]  Great job in El Paso.
[00:57:29.677 --> 00:57:30.338]  Thank you so much.
[00:57:30.358 --> 00:57:30.998]  Thanks.
[00:57:31.219 --> 00:57:33.642]  For your service to the Republic here in America.
[00:57:34.042 --> 00:57:39.264]  All right, next hour coming up, I'm going to hit all the other news I've not yet gotten to.
[00:57:39.284 --> 00:57:42.664]  We're going to have some special guests on, Confessions of a D.C.
[00:57:42.704 --> 00:57:44.225]  Madam, to understand the blackmail.
[00:57:44.465 --> 00:57:56.608]  But I want to thank you, the viewers and the listeners, for spreading the word about InfoWars.com, the free podcast, and all the products we sell on InfoWarsStore.com, because it's your support that made all this possible.
[00:57:56.628 --> 00:57:57.809]  You're standing right beside us.
[00:57:57.869 --> 00:57:58.349]  I salute you.
[00:58:00.066 --> 00:58:01.207]  I want more candy!
[00:58:01.227 --> 00:58:02.268]  I want more video games!
[00:58:02.308 --> 00:58:02.808]  Mine!
[00:58:03.068 --> 00:58:03.188]  Mine!
[00:58:03.208 --> 00:58:03.288]  Mine!
[00:58:29.926 --> 00:58:30.786]  That's right.
[00:58:59.594 --> 00:59:00.495]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:59:00.555 --> 00:59:00.975]  Good, brother.
[00:59:01.115 --> 00:59:02.857]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:59:03.077 --> 00:59:04.619]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:59:04.799 --> 00:59:08.802]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:59:08.822 --> 00:59:09.563]  Well, thank you, brother.
[00:59:09.583 --> 00:59:13.667]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:59:13.867 --> 00:59:21.714]  Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:59:22.054 --> 00:59:25.138]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:59:25.278 --> 00:59:26.760]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.723]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:59:29.843 --> 00:59:31.225]  They've made a ton of money there.
[00:59:31.505 --> 00:59:37.312]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated.
[00:59:37.512 --> 00:59:40.174]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.559 --> 01:00:17.592]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:18.194 --> 01:00:21.180]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:30.999 --> 01:00:38.064]  Well, conspiracy theories are running wild tonight about the Army's plan for a multi-state training exercise this summer called Jade Helm 15.
[01:00:38.624 --> 01:00:45.328]  While the military says it's just training soldiers for the realities of war, critics say the Army is preparing for modern-day martial law.
[01:00:45.508 --> 01:00:49.071]  We really didn't have the violence that we see today.
[01:00:49.871 --> 01:00:54.474]  The weaponry is totally different now than it was in the beginning of my career.
[01:00:54.514 --> 01:00:55.955]  We're training exactly for what?
[01:01:18.862 --> 01:01:21.063]  I'm a sovereign citizen.
[01:01:21.123 --> 01:01:23.463]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[01:01:23.483 --> 01:01:25.664]  I refuse to recognize you.
[01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:31.385]  That was interesting.
[01:01:31.405 --> 01:01:41.868]  The nice thing about this piece of equipment is that if somebody is directing fire toward a team that's trying to get in, they can pull right up to a friend.
[01:01:41.908 --> 01:01:47.109]  You can take enemy fire and still try to address threat without being scared of getting shot.
[01:01:47.389 --> 01:01:52.030]  So I'm thinking that is totally appropriate in Iraq, but what kind of a situation in the U.S.
[01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:53.071]  would you see that happening?
[01:01:53.131 --> 01:01:57.172]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[01:01:57.192 --> 01:01:58.472]  A lot of ammunition.
[01:01:58.492 --> 01:02:04.174]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[01:02:04.194 --> 01:02:05.835]  A lot of ammunition.
[01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:09.196]  They have no weapons here locally.
[01:02:09.216 --> 01:02:11.136]  So what happens if the PLR take over?
[01:02:11.736 --> 01:02:13.457]  A country run by terrorists ain't good.
[01:02:14.483 --> 01:02:17.825]  Bro, America was founded by terrorists or terrorists.
[01:02:18.425 --> 01:02:20.526]  What do you think the f*** Revolutionary War was?
[01:02:21.087 --> 01:02:24.088]  Mystery is determined by the f***ing victim.
[01:02:24.268 --> 01:02:25.969]  How did you even get into the Marines?
[01:02:26.289 --> 01:02:32.973]  Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States?
[01:02:33.073 --> 01:02:33.253]  Who?
[01:02:33.273 --> 01:02:34.153]  Family Bob.
[01:02:34.494 --> 01:02:35.994]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
[01:02:36.014 --> 01:02:36.695]  Oh yeah.
[01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:38.656]  You mean, uh, George Washington?
[01:02:38.716 --> 01:02:39.136]  Oh yeah.
[01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:39.876]  Paul Revere?
[01:02:40.137 --> 01:02:40.717]  Yeah.
[01:02:40.937 --> 01:02:42.378]  These guys right here,
[01:02:43.629 --> 01:02:44.590]  Can we ask you something?
[01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:45.930]  Did they try to scare people?
[01:02:46.271 --> 01:02:50.093]  They tried to intimidate the British.
[01:02:50.173 --> 01:02:51.894]  Did they use acts of violence?
[01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:57.738]  Your founding fathers, my founding fathers, were involved in acts of terrorism against British officials.
[01:02:58.803 --> 01:03:02.246]  Jade Helm troops to operate undetected amongst civilian population.
[01:03:02.767 --> 01:03:05.269]  And of course, the military people and the vets are not buying any of it.
[01:03:05.289 --> 01:03:05.870]  They're not stupid.
[01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:11.916]  You can read about how it's to get the hearts and minds and how to get the public used to working and the local police working with the military.
[01:03:12.416 --> 01:03:18.302]  I mean, everybody who's been in the military knows about the secret EOD program going on for 18 years.
[01:03:18.722 --> 01:03:22.866]  Their whole ordinance disposal, you know, quote, the army is going to show up to defuse a bomb.
[01:03:23.652 --> 01:03:25.633]  But then you get the internal agreements.
[01:03:25.753 --> 01:03:33.394]  It's for everything from warrant service to checkpoints with military personnel in nondescript blue jumpsuits.
[01:03:33.534 --> 01:03:38.216]  Just like the Army Ranger called in and said they were wearing EPA blue jumpsuits.
[01:03:38.296 --> 01:03:41.056]  It's always blue or tan jumpsuits.
[01:03:41.857 --> 01:03:43.517]  And it might say EPA.
[01:03:43.637 --> 01:03:44.817]  It might say police.
[01:03:45.838 --> 01:03:47.138]  It might say park serfs.
[01:03:48.118 --> 01:04:06.482]  Training with the police, training with locals, in plain clothes, quote, doing suspicious activities, is to train the police to work with the military in covert operations, and to condition the military to accept it, and to condition the public to accept it, and then when we cover it and talk about it, they practice the PSYOP in real time, putting out this information.
[01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:08.283]  I can see the script from Army Times.
[01:04:09.474 --> 01:04:17.919]  To Military.com, to Stars and Stripes, to Bloomberg, to Daily Beast, to Vice, to the Houston Chronicle, and no exaggeration today.
[01:04:19.741 --> 01:04:21.782]  You go search Jade Helm.
[01:04:24.704 --> 01:04:29.387]  There are now hundreds of articles, and in almost all of them, yours truly is being demonized.
[01:04:29.727 --> 01:04:36.631]  Jones, who's warned of an imminent takeover for decades, keeps claiming it's gonna happen, but of course it never does.
[01:04:36.811 --> 01:04:38.372]  No, it never does!
[01:04:38.772 --> 01:04:50.178]  Checkpoints, TSA, open spying, highway dividers being put up nationwide, open manuals that the number one enemies, veterans and gun owners and Christians, I mean, come on!
[01:04:51.799 --> 01:04:52.860]  This is the PSYOP!
[01:04:58.803 --> 01:04:59.823]  We're going to break.
[01:05:00.284 --> 01:05:08.486]  I'm going to do one segment on the reauthorization of the Patriot Act, Oklahoma City 20 years later, and then special guests are joining us.
[01:05:08.786 --> 01:05:09.807]  The experts are clear.
[01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:17.089]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:05:17.229 --> 01:05:21.811]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[01:05:23.471 --> 01:05:27.053]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary nascent iodine formula.
[01:05:27.213 --> 01:05:31.115]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:05:31.435 --> 01:05:36.477]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:05:36.757 --> 01:05:37.657]  Not our iodine.
[01:05:37.757 --> 01:05:41.339]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[01:05:41.579 --> 01:05:43.920]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:06:14.946 --> 01:06:20.508]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:20.988 --> 01:06:23.630]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:06:25.810 --> 01:06:28.632]  A lot of people have heard about the Franklin cover-up.
[01:06:29.972 --> 01:06:41.737]  It was Senator DeCamp that wrote a book, I don't know, almost 20 years ago, claiming that Boys Town, and even on my show, talked about Penn State being a pedophile front, at least part of it.
[01:06:42.357 --> 01:06:43.938]  And all that came out in the news later.
[01:06:45.117 --> 01:06:51.781]  Well, we've got a author who's written a book on the subject and has some pretty amazing contacts.
[01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:57.004]  Confessions of a DC Madam, The Politics of Sex, Lies, and Blackmail.
[01:06:57.604 --> 01:07:00.226]  Henry W. Vinson with Nick Bryant.
[01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:17.202]  Joining us, coming up today, and I don't really know where to start with this in the next segment because it's such a huge, huge subject and some of the stuff one of these guys has been involved in is, well, over the top.
[01:07:18.063 --> 01:07:20.505]  So I'm just going to let them speak for themselves, I think.
[01:07:21.606 --> 01:07:25.269]  I've researched this, I've looked into it quite a bit.
[01:07:25.289 --> 01:07:25.950]  I knew the D.C.
[01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:29.032]  madam, interviewed her before she died, talked to her a few times off air.
[01:07:29.912 --> 01:07:31.113]  This is a scary book.
[01:07:31.613 --> 01:07:33.714]  We're not selling it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:07:33.734 --> 01:07:35.275]  We should be, but we're not yet.
[01:07:35.355 --> 01:07:36.336]  Confessions of a D.C.
[01:07:36.376 --> 01:07:36.716]  Madam.
[01:07:38.017 --> 01:07:43.721]  It's coming up through investigative journalism in the next few segments.
[01:07:45.339 --> 01:07:49.640]  That said, I mentioned this earlier, but I want to hit it right now because it's a big deal.
[01:07:50.541 --> 01:07:58.543]  Congress is attempting to reauthorize key Patriot Act provisions, which is the opposite of the Patriot, by sneaking it into USA Freedom Act.
[01:07:58.923 --> 01:08:07.986]  Now remember, all the NSA spying, all the Patriot Act, didn't get rid of Al Qaeda, it's now metamorphosized into ISIS and is 20 times bigger.
[01:08:08.886 --> 01:08:12.890]  And we're being told, give all our rights up, prepare for imminent Al-Qaeda attacks, ISIS attacks.
[01:08:13.691 --> 01:08:16.033]  So, it is all a giant fraud.
[01:08:16.073 --> 01:08:17.995]  Giving up your liberty does not give you security.
[01:08:18.795 --> 01:08:20.937]  We're always told, there's a trade-off, an equation.
[01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:23.160]  You give up liberty, you're safer.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:26.543]  No, you have more liberty, you're safer historically.
[01:08:28.677 --> 01:08:30.038]  But we all play along the narrative.
[01:08:30.058 --> 01:08:35.020]  It's like US propaganda, you know, claims Russia started the war in Ukraine.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.141]  It's not US propaganda.
[01:08:37.421 --> 01:08:48.926]  It's mega global banks that have already conquered us that are using American muscle and our credit line to launch wars all over the world, which we don't even get the spoils of.
[01:08:49.426 --> 01:08:52.747]  If I was a sociopath, I want to say this right now.
[01:08:54.328 --> 01:08:56.409]  If I was a sociopath or one worse,
[01:08:57.461 --> 01:08:59.002]  A sadistic psychopath.
[01:09:02.583 --> 01:09:05.405]  I would be against starting a war with Russia and the New World Order.
[01:09:05.565 --> 01:09:10.347]  Because it's not for me, it's not for my family, it doesn't get me ahead.
[01:09:11.727 --> 01:09:13.768]  Now I happen to be a person that's moral and cares.
[01:09:14.949 --> 01:09:19.371]  And I guess sociopaths and psychopaths can't seem to fight against evil, even when it's in their own interest.
[01:09:19.911 --> 01:09:21.592]  That's one of the mysteries of the universe.
[01:09:21.612 --> 01:09:23.653]  But I guess they can't go against their father, the devil.
[01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:30.721]  All I know is, for my own self-preservation, fighting this is the right course.
[01:09:33.727 --> 01:09:34.368]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:09:36.109 --> 01:09:37.870]  I want a high standard of law.
[01:09:38.230 --> 01:09:39.810]  I want a high standard of human rights.
[01:09:40.170 --> 01:09:41.891]  I want a high standard of due process.
[01:09:42.391 --> 01:09:44.411]  I want a high standard of freedom.
[01:09:44.891 --> 01:09:46.252]  Because I want to enjoy it.
[01:09:46.972 --> 01:09:48.312]  And I want my kids to enjoy it.
[01:09:48.653 --> 01:09:55.174]  And I want the security and the protection that comes with being a free state, where everybody wants to come here.
[01:09:55.775 --> 01:09:56.935]  But you don't get handouts.
[01:09:58.049 --> 01:09:58.789]  Like Switzerland.
[01:09:59.449 --> 01:10:02.550]  You come to the country where people want to work and want to share ideas.
[01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:05.411]  We've become the opposite of that in many ways.
[01:10:05.991 --> 01:10:08.952]  But still, there is a kernel of greatness to America.
[01:10:09.012 --> 01:10:10.172]  We were exceptional.
[01:10:11.233 --> 01:10:14.534]  But we're not exceptional because we have transgender bathrooms.
[01:10:15.314 --> 01:10:16.774]  Hey, great, transgender bathrooms.
[01:10:16.814 --> 01:10:18.815]  Point is, that shouldn't be our mission.
[01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:25.023]  Those are all distractionary infighting tools by social engineers to get us fighting with each other.
[01:10:25.423 --> 01:10:27.764]  And I'm here to try to get people to see the rabbit trick.
[01:10:28.185 --> 01:10:29.925]  How the scam works, how it operates.
[01:10:32.907 --> 01:10:44.551]  So Congress is attempting to reauthorize key Patriot Act provisions for NSA warrantless spying, sneak and peek, break in your house, NDAA, disappear you.
[01:10:44.691 --> 01:10:47.493]  I mean, you talk about give up liberty, you get security.
[01:10:47.553 --> 01:10:47.993]  No, you don't.
[01:10:49.551 --> 01:10:53.612]  Give up liberty, it's like giving up atmosphere or gravity.
[01:10:53.972 --> 01:10:55.793]  Your muscles atrophy and fall apart.
[01:10:56.893 --> 01:11:01.835]  It is the animating contest of liberty that makes the man that makes the woman.
[01:11:03.115 --> 01:11:08.817]  Making it part of something that ostensibly appears to be reigning in surveillance powers.
[01:11:09.517 --> 01:11:11.298]  That's right, the USA Freedom Act
[01:11:13.049 --> 01:11:16.813]  Which is bipartisanly supported, actually brings the Patriot Act back in.
[01:11:16.833 --> 01:11:19.496]  N.S.A.
[01:11:20.597 --> 01:11:21.158]  and F.B.I.
[01:11:21.198 --> 01:11:25.242]  fight to retain spy powers as surveillance law nears expiration.
[01:11:30.708 --> 01:11:34.973]  Simply amazing that that is going on, and that is in mainstream news.
[01:11:37.366 --> 01:11:38.687]  That is out of the London Guardian.
[01:11:39.647 --> 01:11:40.528]  So they get it right.
[01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:43.229]  Not that the Guardian is perfect, but they actually break it down.
[01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:50.453]  Meanwhile, RFID tracking system to replace license plate, license plates are
[01:11:51.593 --> 01:11:55.275]  A once sensible administrative tool today undercuts privacy.
[01:11:55.695 --> 01:11:57.056]  That's out of the Washington Examiner.
[01:11:57.356 --> 01:12:06.200]  Yes, they're already barcodes, they're already RFID, because license plate reading cameras already scan it and track it, but now with RFID you won't be able to escape it.
[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:16.345]  They'll track everywhere you go, everything you do, so the system can game what you're doing and do things like not fix roads that aren't toll roads to force you onto toll roads.
[01:12:16.725 --> 01:12:19.327]  You see, so many good people say, Alex,
[01:12:21.545 --> 01:12:24.207]  I have nothing to hide, I don't care if I'm being spied on.
[01:12:26.868 --> 01:12:36.213]  Then put, when you're going on a trip on Facebook, and put your alarm code on Facebook or Twitter, and put where you live and where your jewelry is, you're gonna get robbed.
[01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:42.677]  You lock your doors, you lower your blinds, because it's a simple, basic security measure.
[01:12:43.837 --> 01:12:46.739]  And it's a simple, privacy-instinctive measure.
[01:12:47.773 --> 01:12:52.076]  That if you went back 3,000 years ago, and what is Germania today?
[01:12:52.576 --> 01:12:55.618]  Or 3,000 years ago, what is Central Africa today?
[01:12:55.638 --> 01:13:00.362]  At the gates to a village, they would post guards at night.
[01:13:01.584 --> 01:13:14.007]  And do you know why they did that, or why they would close the gate at night, show wild elephants didn't come in, or tigers, or lions, depending on what part of the world you lived in, tigers, India, lions, Africa, or a cave bear in Germany.
[01:13:14.587 --> 01:13:15.547]  What's Germany today?
[01:13:15.567 --> 01:13:22.209]  I mean, you know, I lock my door, not because I'm a coward, but because you're going to have to knock it down to get in.
[01:13:22.269 --> 01:13:24.070]  And then I'm going to be waiting for you.
[01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:25.630]  And I got teeth and claws.
[01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:31.002]  And so the idea that we should have everything unencrypted and open to the government.
[01:13:31.383 --> 01:13:33.606]  Oh, and then all the hackers and criminals as well?
[01:13:34.187 --> 01:13:39.375]  And the criminals in government that are constantly selling data to foreign governments and corporations?
[01:13:39.435 --> 01:13:40.397]  I mean, is this a joke?
[01:13:42.332 --> 01:13:50.675]  Did you know since the NSA started ubiquitous spying in the last few decades that no one at the NSA can check and see in the database who accessed the database?
[01:13:51.115 --> 01:13:58.578]  It's designed for internal groups to engage in fraud and the takedown of the country, and that indeed has happened!
[01:13:59.558 --> 01:14:01.699]  The opposite of national security, again!
[01:14:03.607 --> 01:14:08.170]  Five trillion dollars later, that's conservative, how much just some of these wars have cost.
[01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:10.431]  Five, in fact that's a low number.
[01:14:11.211 --> 01:14:14.693]  The Iraq war was three trillion, Afghanistan a trillion and a half domestic.
[01:14:16.234 --> 01:14:16.914]  That's six trillion.
[01:14:17.434 --> 01:14:21.277]  Six trillion dollars later, are you safer now?
[01:14:21.317 --> 01:14:22.057]  The answer is no.
[01:14:22.277 --> 01:14:25.539]  They say ISIS is everywhere, give up your rights, oh my gosh they're going to attack any minute.
[01:14:27.026 --> 01:14:36.648]  Why would government and other corporate interests ever stop something like Islamic State or Al-Qaeda if that group being out there allowed them to basically take freedom domestically here?
[01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:41.450]  Think about that.
[01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:45.010]  Think about how long all of this has been going on.
[01:14:45.611 --> 01:14:55.693]  The big threat is the big government because it becomes the dashboard, the control panel, for special interests that can move those levers to get in there and control our lives.
[01:14:57.759 --> 01:15:00.121]  And then you wonder how the special interests control Congress.
[01:15:03.944 --> 01:15:13.931]  The way it starts when you're first a senator or a member of the House is the most beautiful woman you've ever seen in your life start hitting on you at the gym, or your favorite barbecue place, or at church.
[01:15:14.472 --> 01:15:15.452]  They don't care where you go.
[01:15:17.454 --> 01:15:19.756]  And pretty soon as a man, you can't say no.
[01:15:20.936 --> 01:15:22.698]  Then they say, Senator, Congressman,
[01:15:24.517 --> 01:15:29.764]  We're going to release this in the news, your girlfriends and all the rest of it if you don't play ball.
[01:15:29.784 --> 01:15:31.227]  Now that's the good guys.
[01:15:32.969 --> 01:15:33.750]  The bad guys.
[01:15:34.793 --> 01:15:37.954]  Get in the upper level clubs because they're willing to do stuff to kids.
[01:15:38.474 --> 01:15:45.735]  And it's come out in the news that they get involved with the kids, not because they're even into it, but because that's like the gangster ritual or initiation.
[01:15:46.435 --> 01:15:50.056]  You've heard about different black gangs, white gangs, Hispanic gangs, they're all the same.
[01:15:50.236 --> 01:15:54.177]  You gotta kill an old lady, you gotta kill somebody, you gotta rob a liquor store and shoot the clerk.
[01:15:54.777 --> 01:15:58.878]  Well, to get into the upper elite, you gotta, you gotta wanna rape children.
[01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:03.835]  We're gonna look at all this and more straight ahead with Confessions of a D.C.
[01:16:03.876 --> 01:16:04.156]  Madam.
[01:16:04.657 --> 01:16:05.518]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:16:05.578 --> 01:16:07.120]  We're going down the rabbit hole.
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:07.641]  Stay with us.
[01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:14.901]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:16:15.041 --> 01:16:20.925]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:16:21.165 --> 01:16:25.728]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:29.250]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:16:29.511 --> 01:16:31.092]  No needles, no injections.
[01:16:31.492 --> 01:16:36.615]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:16:39.797 --> 01:16:40.417]  Alex Jones here.
[01:16:40.818 --> 01:16:49.882]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:16:50.102 --> 01:16:53.584]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:11.353]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:17:11.653 --> 01:17:15.396]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:17:15.877 --> 01:17:20.240]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:27.126]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:17:27.647 --> 01:17:35.213]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular
[01:17:35.213 --> 01:17:35.373]  I'm good.
[01:17:54.631 --> 01:17:55.472]  We're good to go.
[01:18:09.645 --> 01:18:10.546]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:18:10.726 --> 01:18:18.393]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lifted weights 5 days a week, I could swim 2-3 miles.
[01:18:18.753 --> 01:18:21.676]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[01:18:21.916 --> 01:18:23.478]  I started an access television show.
[01:18:23.878 --> 01:18:28.663]  I was so dedicated to my work, and hanging around with radio guys, that I began drinking.
[01:18:29.263 --> 01:18:32.106]  I began smoking cigars, and then even cigarettes.
[01:18:32.626 --> 01:18:38.353]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[01:18:38.693 --> 01:18:43.559]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:48.866]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[01:18:49.146 --> 01:18:50.568]  When I added to the mix,
[01:18:50.908 --> 01:18:54.834]  The key products developed by Dr. Group for InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:18:55.114 --> 01:18:56.216]  The results were incredible.

[01:19:09.249 --> 01:19:16.213]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:20:03.875 --> 01:20:04.235]  Silver Bullet.
[01:20:04.255 --> 01:20:06.296]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:29.674 --> 01:20:31.835]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:32.296 --> 01:20:37.539]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:52.387]  I'm not going to go over their bios for you, but I'm aware of the work of both individuals.
[01:20:52.427 --> 01:20:54.208]  The book is excellent.
[01:20:55.782 --> 01:20:56.502]  We're not selling it.
[01:20:56.702 --> 01:20:58.483]  You can find it online or Amazon.com.
[01:20:59.003 --> 01:21:00.324]  Confessions of a D.C.
[01:21:00.444 --> 01:21:00.844]  madam.
[01:21:00.864 --> 01:21:03.005]  The politics of sex, lies and blackmail.
[01:21:03.585 --> 01:21:06.067]  Henry W. Vinson with Nick Bryan.
[01:21:07.867 --> 01:21:14.050]  And now for the rest of the hour, I really want to try to give these guys the floor because if I start asking questions, we're going to go down some rabbit trails.
[01:21:14.690 --> 01:21:21.894]  Henry Vinson was a male madam over a major gay escort operation that's on record in D.C.
[01:21:22.952 --> 01:21:25.193]  And from what I've seen, that's more popular in D.C.
[01:21:25.353 --> 01:21:27.674]  from the news we've followed than the other way.
[01:21:29.335 --> 01:21:35.398]  And then, of course, Nick Bryan has written on the Franklin cover-up and other major issues that we're well-versed on here.
[01:21:36.459 --> 01:21:40.240]  The blog is blog.comconfessionsofadcmadam.com.
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:41.741]  The book is Confessions of a D.C.
[01:21:41.781 --> 01:21:42.081]  Madam.
[01:21:42.842 --> 01:21:47.864]  If you want to know why Washington is so controlled and why it's so corrupt, it's blackmail.
[01:21:48.364 --> 01:21:51.546]  And you can't even get into the club unless they think you're blackmailable.
[01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:57.734]  And this gets into, in the case of the Franklin cover-up, underage, you name it.
[01:21:58.555 --> 01:22:02.779]  I interviewed Debra Jean Palfrey before she died.
[01:22:02.799 --> 01:22:05.801]  The famous D.C.
[01:22:05.842 --> 01:22:07.643]  madam, they obviously murdered her.
[01:22:09.107 --> 01:22:12.629]  Death note, suicide note, wasn't even in her handwriting.
[01:22:12.669 --> 01:22:17.651]  I had her condo manager that she owned, friends send me her lease, her handwriting.
[01:22:18.171 --> 01:22:21.073]  I had the Florida State Police calling me about it.
[01:22:21.113 --> 01:22:22.393]  I mean, this was a big deal that happened.
[01:22:22.413 --> 01:22:24.074]  I was on Fox News, CNN, you name it.
[01:22:25.075 --> 01:22:26.055]  My point is, we've studied this.
[01:22:26.996 --> 01:22:29.457]  And this is how they're controlling people.
[01:22:30.549 --> 01:22:32.470]  So, who should start first here?
[01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:42.335]  Henry Vinson to give us the overview as a former gay madam, or Nick Bryant to give us some of the larger picture.
[01:22:42.355 --> 01:22:43.416]  Where should we start, gentlemen?
[01:22:44.576 --> 01:22:45.977]  Let Henry start with the overview.
[01:22:46.877 --> 01:22:55.502]  Yeah, Henry, for the rest of the six, seven, eight minutes of this segment, break down why this is important and what you cover in the book and why folks should investigate it.
[01:22:56.847 --> 01:23:13.521]  Well, I ran the largest gay escort service that's ever been exposed in Washington, D.C., and my ultimate downfall was precipitated by the fact that I provided escorts to a CIA asset named Craig Smith, who used my escorts to blackmail politicians and other power brokers.
[01:23:14.061 --> 01:23:21.768]  I ultimately became the fall guy for a sprawling conspiracy whose cover-up was engineered at the pinnacle of the Bush 1 administration.
[01:23:22.658 --> 01:23:30.766]  And I haven't told my story, and this is the first time I've told it, but I've undergone a 25-year character assassination by the media.
[01:23:31.526 --> 01:23:37.872]  And I believe the American political system has become a wayward aberration of the ideas it was built upon.
[01:23:38.473 --> 01:23:43.557]  And I believe that blackmail has played an integral role in hijacking our political system.
[01:23:44.838 --> 01:23:48.462]  And that's my reasons for writing the book, and that's basically what it's about.
[01:23:49.275 --> 01:23:50.056]  So it's WMD.
[01:23:50.076 --> 01:23:52.237]  It's Mutually Assured Destruction.
[01:23:52.257 --> 01:23:52.357]  Mad.
[01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:18.370]  That's right.
[01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:24.975]  Political blackmail is almost never made public, and if it does become public, it's usually years after the fact.
[01:24:25.415 --> 01:24:27.557]  Just look at J. Edgar Hoover, for example.
[01:24:30.059 --> 01:24:30.579]  Amazing.
[01:24:30.839 --> 01:24:31.620]  Please break it down.
[01:24:33.195 --> 01:24:38.539]  And I think that Larry Craig is an example of a congressman who was possibly compromised.
[01:24:38.979 --> 01:24:40.020]  Craig was in D.C.
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:42.001]  for nearly 30 years as a U.S.
[01:24:42.061 --> 01:24:43.523]  representative and a senator.
[01:24:44.023 --> 01:24:52.789]  And given Craig's status as a conservative Republican, if word of his shadow life leaked out, it would result in political suicide and public disgrace.
[01:24:53.450 --> 01:24:56.752]  But his runaway libido compelled him to take mind-boggling risks.
[01:24:57.361 --> 01:25:05.282]  And I find it impossible to believe that Craig's homosexual exploits were unnoticed by the blackmail ring that I provided with escorts.
[01:25:05.522 --> 01:25:10.423]  Because I provided Craig with escorts and the ring was well aware of all my patrons.
[01:25:11.043 --> 01:25:24.266]  And I'm also of the belief that the foremost explanation that can be offered concerning Craig's brazen exploits with regards to his homosexuality is that he was compromised and was mindful that his brazen exploits would be covered up.
[01:25:26.053 --> 01:25:30.216]  I think that it's much more prevalent, black male, than what many people believe.
[01:25:31.837 --> 01:25:33.158]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:25:33.178 --> 01:25:37.381]  Just because it's interesting to understand the mindset.
[01:25:38.142 --> 01:25:43.506]  Do Republicans like more gay escorts, or female escorts, or is it Democrats?
[01:25:43.526 --> 01:25:49.430]  Because I've always been told, for whatever reason, Republicans are more into men than the Democrats, or is that not true?
[01:25:53.326 --> 01:26:08.074]  Well, I operated an escort service during the Bush one and the Reagan administration, so they certainly did, they were a lot of my clients, so I think that the Republicans do use a lot of gay escorts.
[01:26:10.964 --> 01:26:22.811]  Well, I remember the Washington Times doing a cover page series of articles about the underage cowboy ring busted at the Bush Senior White House and how that almost brought down the administration.
[01:26:23.232 --> 01:26:30.396]  I wonder how you'd get an ultra right-wing publication like the Washington Times ready to report on something like that.
[01:26:30.416 --> 01:26:36.760]  Well, the media covered this up quite a bit.
[01:26:37.612 --> 01:26:51.330]  And that's a rather complex answer as to why that happened, and I think that it has to do with the CIA infiltrating the media, because 90% of the media is controlled by five major corporations.
[01:26:53.086 --> 01:26:55.047]  And if you're a new listener, we'll put it back on screen.
[01:26:55.087 --> 01:26:57.569]  We found the Washington Times headline, actual scan.
[01:26:58.049 --> 01:27:04.534]  Homosexual prostitution inquiry ensnares VIPs with Reagan, Bush, and then it's got copies of the receipts.
[01:27:05.615 --> 01:27:09.277]  What would be going on at the White House with underage cowboys being delivered there?
[01:27:10.878 --> 01:27:14.221]  Well, Craig Spence was a very big lobbyist.
[01:27:14.381 --> 01:27:17.943]  He was a pretty powerful person.
[01:27:17.983 --> 01:27:19.504]  He was a real mover and shaker.
[01:27:20.345 --> 01:27:21.706]  And he had my
[01:27:22.489 --> 01:27:25.130]  Escorts actually have tours of the White House.
[01:27:25.170 --> 01:27:30.873]  He was so powerful that he could arrange midnight tours of the White House for escorts that I employed.
[01:27:32.313 --> 01:27:33.534]  So you were involved with that?
[01:27:35.235 --> 01:27:36.095]  Yes, I was.
[01:27:36.195 --> 01:27:38.476]  Craig Spence was my biggest client.
[01:27:39.036 --> 01:27:41.037]  Spent about $20,000 a month.
[01:27:41.658 --> 01:27:48.181]  He had these beautiful parties at his house that would look like a who's who of Washington, D.C.
[01:27:48.261 --> 01:27:48.801]  There would be
[01:27:50.295 --> 01:27:55.038]  Power brokers, lawmakers, government officials, media people.
[01:27:55.638 --> 01:27:58.020]  It would truly look like a who's who of Washington.
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:01.942]  And of course his house was set up for blackmail.
[01:28:02.042 --> 01:28:03.423]  There were two-way mirrors.
[01:28:03.443 --> 01:28:07.206]  There was audio tapes, videotapes.
[01:28:07.266 --> 01:28:12.209]  So that's how Craig was able to have such influence and was such a successful lobbyist.
[01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:18.073]  And getting to the Central Intelligence Agency connection there, can you speak to that?
[01:28:21.011 --> 01:28:34.918]  Sure, Craig was a CIA asset, and one of the clients, as I name in my book, was William Casey, and he was the director of the CIA.
[01:28:35.439 --> 01:28:43.603]  He was a very good friend of Craig Spence, and he would be at these parties, so it was a pretty interesting place.
[01:28:45.282 --> 01:28:47.745]  Well, again, I don't just go off your book.
[01:28:47.805 --> 01:28:50.748]  I've got mainstream news articles about it listing your name.
[01:28:51.529 --> 01:28:54.712]  And so we know that at least much of what you're saying is true.
[01:28:55.473 --> 01:28:58.216]  We know this is going on, but I want to get from you when we come back.
[01:28:59.077 --> 01:29:00.859]  Folks should get the book, Confessions of a D.C.
[01:29:00.899 --> 01:29:01.099]  Madam.
[01:29:01.119 --> 01:29:02.921]  You have a lot of courage to put it out with Nick Bryan.
[01:29:03.362 --> 01:29:05.083]  I want to get from you how widespread is it?
[01:29:05.103 --> 01:29:06.725]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:06.745 --> 01:29:07.146]  Stay with us.
[01:29:09.884 --> 01:29:19.447]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[01:29:19.907 --> 01:29:21.647]  It's the illusion of choice.
[01:29:21.667 --> 01:29:22.368]  Think about it.
[01:29:22.568 --> 01:29:28.369]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[01:29:28.609 --> 01:29:34.171]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[01:29:34.551 --> 01:29:46.316]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[01:29:46.596 --> 01:29:49.377]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[01:29:49.577 --> 01:29:52.038]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[01:29:52.359 --> 01:29:56.801]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[01:29:57.241 --> 01:29:57.821]  Think about it.
[01:29:58.021 --> 01:30:04.869]  This is Darren McBreen, and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:09.254]  And listen to the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on in your mind.
[01:30:13.038 --> 01:30:22.303]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:30:22.643 --> 01:30:25.185]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:30:25.225 --> 01:30:28.727]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:30:28.907 --> 01:30:34.930]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[01:30:35.230 --> 01:30:40.073]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:30:40.353 --> 01:30:46.535]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:30:46.735 --> 01:30:54.216]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:30:54.476 --> 01:31:01.758]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[01:31:02.018 --> 01:31:05.459]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:05.619 --> 01:31:08.540]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:10.861]  Another major health threat.
[01:31:10.901 --> 01:31:15.802]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:31:15.882 --> 01:31:18.523]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:31:18.543 --> 01:31:25.326]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:31:25.586 --> 01:31:28.447]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:31:28.587 --> 01:31:31.508]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:31:31.528 --> 01:31:33.529]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:31:33.549 --> 01:31:36.410]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:41.973]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.

[01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:05.462]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:23.038 --> 01:33:24.539]  We are on the march.
[01:33:24.899 --> 01:33:27.340]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:31.842]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:33.263 --> 01:33:40.166]  Anytime Congress starts getting out of line, the Globalists will just burn a few House or Senate members.
[01:33:41.516 --> 01:33:45.922]  And then everybody basically runs to the hills and doesn't argue with their marching orders.
[01:33:46.363 --> 01:33:54.154]  Back in 1989, Tom Brokaw reported on the scandal that Henry W. Vinson, our guest, was part of.
[01:33:54.494 --> 01:33:55.155]  Here is that report.
[01:33:57.168 --> 01:34:09.658]  And if Washington doesn't have enough to talk about these days, the Washington Times reported today that unidentified White House aides in the Carter, Reagan, and Bush administrations now are being investigated for using the services of a callboy ring.
[01:34:10.219 --> 01:34:14.822]  The paper reports that two of the male prostitutes were given a late-night tour of the White House last year.
[01:34:14.842 --> 01:34:19.166]  The White House press secretary, Marlon Fitzwater, said he knew nothing of this investigation.
[01:34:19.918 --> 01:34:22.263]  NBC's Lisa Myers reports her sources in the U.S.
[01:34:22.303 --> 01:34:30.941]  Attorney's Office say the investigation is not focusing on prostitution, but on fraud involving the use of credit cards to pay the callboy services.
[01:34:32.435 --> 01:34:33.195]  There you go!
[01:34:33.796 --> 01:34:37.177]  Let's go back to Henry W. Vinson and his co-author Nick Bryan.
[01:34:37.557 --> 01:34:47.141]  Henry W. Vinson is a known, admitted, major gay madame, who was operating then, and who the CIA basically used to set people up with, I guess unbeknownst to him.
[01:34:47.161 --> 01:34:52.663]  And that's the rest of the story of how they use this NSA-type grid to totally control everybody.
[01:34:53.243 --> 01:34:56.945]  And then manipulate our morals as a way to bring in a total tyranny.
[01:34:57.685 --> 01:35:06.550]  Henry W. Benson, I mean, hit the key points here because you've already covered some bombshell info, but I don't want to encumber you from really telling the public the meat of what you want to get at.
[01:35:06.570 --> 01:35:11.853]  Well, I just want to talk about blackmail.
[01:35:11.893 --> 01:35:15.875]  What an integral role that blackmail plays in the American political process.
[01:35:16.665 --> 01:35:19.806]  And it usually doesn't come out until years after the fact.
[01:35:20.466 --> 01:35:34.049]  And when I was in the escort business, I had clients such as William Casey, Charles Dutcher, Paul Ballack was the Labor Secretary, Elizabeth Dole's political personnel liaison, Larry Craig.
[01:35:34.769 --> 01:35:36.289]  So I think that's circular.
[01:35:36.309 --> 01:35:39.350]  I think it was going on before I got there, and I think it's still going on.
[01:35:41.271 --> 01:35:45.292]  Well sure, and again people say I don't want to hear about what people do sexually.
[01:35:45.833 --> 01:35:52.075]  The issue is that it's being used to blackmail people and that's how special interests are in control today.
[01:35:52.435 --> 01:35:55.596]  From what you know, are things better today or worse?
[01:35:58.017 --> 01:35:59.437]  I think it's just a constant.
[01:36:00.818 --> 01:36:06.439]  Kingdoms, empires, syndicates and scrupulous groups have all deployed blackmail since time immemorial.
[01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:10.701]  And blackmail has played an integral role in the political process
[01:36:11.681 --> 01:36:13.042]  For hundreds of years.
[01:36:13.162 --> 01:36:16.745]  So, Blackmail was going on before Henry ran his escort service.
[01:36:16.785 --> 01:36:23.189]  It was going on while Henry was running his escort service, and it's going on well after Henry left the escort business.
[01:36:23.470 --> 01:36:25.691]  So, and it's going on today.
[01:36:25.711 --> 01:36:26.652]  There's no doubt about that.
[01:36:29.577 --> 01:36:32.199]  Is there any way to stop this?
[01:36:32.279 --> 01:36:33.640]  Is there any way to reverse this?
[01:36:33.721 --> 01:36:43.068]  Because if people can be blackmailed, or in the case of the IRS, just intimidated into going along with things, special interests will be able to basically create a total tyranny.
[01:36:44.630 --> 01:36:48.093]  Well, the problem with that is people have to be edified.
[01:36:48.493 --> 01:36:53.097]  Blackmailing of our politicians is a disease that's within our society.
[01:36:53.197 --> 01:36:55.679]  It's like a cancer that's eating away at our society.
[01:36:56.730 --> 01:37:00.573]  And the only way that you can get rid of a disease is by diagnosing it.
[01:37:00.913 --> 01:37:07.137]  And Americans just are not aware that their political system is being co-opted by blackmail.
[01:37:07.157 --> 01:37:09.718]  They're not aware of it because the media doesn't report on it.
[01:37:09.899 --> 01:37:15.282]  And a number of people that use Henry's Escort Service were high flyers in the media.
[01:37:16.143 --> 01:37:22.707]  And I've written in this area for a number of years, and definitely the people that are
[01:37:24.702 --> 01:37:28.784]  The highest targets for blackmail are politicians and also people in the media.
[01:37:28.804 --> 01:37:35.908]  Because you need a compromised media to cover up for the malfeasance that's going on in the government.
[01:37:36.028 --> 01:37:43.452]  If we had a media that told the truth, then Americans would just hit the streets in droves.
[01:37:44.392 --> 01:37:46.434]  And things would have changed at that point.
[01:37:46.614 --> 01:37:49.175]  Henry Vinson, did you ever know the D.C.
[01:37:49.215 --> 01:37:50.636]  Madam, or what did you think of her case?
[01:37:55.379 --> 01:37:56.580]  I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:58.141]  Henry, did you know the D.C.
[01:37:58.181 --> 01:38:00.103]  Madam, or what's your take on her case?
[01:38:01.444 --> 01:38:07.789]  Oh, I didn't know her, but I am familiar with her because she operated years after the fact.
[01:38:07.929 --> 01:38:13.254]  We both ran escort services in Washington, D.C., and both of us were dubbed the D.C.
[01:38:13.294 --> 01:38:13.654]  Madam.
[01:38:14.289 --> 01:38:16.230]  The federal government subjected both Ms.
[01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:22.033]  Palfrey and me to a crucible that was designed to ensure our silence or ultimately crush it.
[01:38:22.373 --> 01:38:22.573]  Ms.
[01:38:22.633 --> 01:38:33.259]  Palfrey was merely running an escort service when the Justice Department smacked her with a 14-count RICO indictment, and I was walloped with a 43-count RICO indictment.
[01:38:33.359 --> 01:38:35.880]  So I was potentially looking at 295 years behind bars.
[01:38:38.317 --> 01:38:38.938]  And I think Ms.
[01:38:38.958 --> 01:38:49.587]  Palfrey became overwhelmed by the Justice Department's crucible and she was unwilling or unable to cope with the government policing her of all of her money and status and depositing her in federal prison.
[01:38:50.227 --> 01:38:58.354]  So I think the government is very effective at silencing people when they are out to do so.
[01:38:58.374 --> 01:39:03.339]  Sorry, go ahead Nick Bryant.
[01:39:06.215 --> 01:39:08.556]  Uh, they're very good at silencing people in the know.
[01:39:08.916 --> 01:39:24.639]  Uh, Debra Jean Palfrey, I think that Henry was much more aware of the blackmail that was going on than Debra Jean Palfrey, because the Department of Justice came after her with a 14-count RICO indictment, whereas they came after Henry with a 43-count RICO indictment.
[01:39:24.679 --> 01:39:27.079]  He was looking at 295 years in prison.
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:34.501]  And the government said to him, if you keep your mouth shut, we'll give you five years, but if you talk, we will put you away for the rest of your life.
[01:39:35.171 --> 01:39:42.220]  So, I think Henry's information was probably far more damaging than the information that Deborah Jane Palfrey had.
[01:39:42.881 --> 01:39:45.685]  And conspiracy silence that...
[01:39:46.610 --> 01:39:49.913]  It's a documentary that's been suppressed but I'm sure that you've seen it.
[01:40:05.524 --> 01:40:07.645]  Or I guess you could say above, even nastier.
[01:40:07.665 --> 01:40:09.447]  In fact, many times more nastier.
[01:40:09.467 --> 01:40:12.248]  Because I personally am for the decriminalization of prostitution.
[01:40:12.588 --> 01:40:15.010]  Not because I even endorse it, but because I'm a libertarian.
[01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:16.611]  I know it only creates corruption.
[01:40:16.671 --> 01:40:18.052]  The pimps want to keep it illegal.
[01:40:18.472 --> 01:40:21.454]  You know, sunlight is what disinfects things.
[01:40:21.914 --> 01:40:25.917]  But when it gets into the underage people and even children, talk about that.
[01:40:28.138 --> 01:40:43.063]  Well, Craig Spence, in addition, he spent $20,000 a month on escorts from Henry's Escort Service, but he also employed female escorts, but he also provided children too, and I've written a book about that.
[01:40:43.543 --> 01:40:49.505]  And Craig Spence provided DC power brokers with whatever they wanted, if they wanted young men in the
[01:40:49.625 --> 01:40:50.245]  I think so.
[01:41:09.986 --> 01:41:12.048]  And there'd be power brokers at his parties.
[01:41:12.088 --> 01:41:15.690]  Henry talked about the power broker cocktail parties earlier.
[01:41:16.071 --> 01:41:19.633]  Where the people in the administration would be at these parties.
[01:41:19.733 --> 01:41:21.555]  People in Congress would be at these parties.
[01:41:21.995 --> 01:41:25.918]  Ted Koppel, William Safire, the high flyers in the media would be at these parties.
[01:41:26.418 --> 01:41:28.880]  And it would start out as like straight cocktail parties.
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:31.382]  And people would be getting lubricated on alcohol.
[01:41:31.462 --> 01:41:39.188]  And maybe at around 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock, somebody would maybe break out some cocaine or something sexually inappropriate might happen.
[01:41:39.808 --> 01:41:40.329]  I think so.
[01:41:58.465 --> 01:42:00.567]  Well, it was compromised first hand.
[01:42:02.068 --> 01:42:14.937]  Craig Spence was asking Henry about his escort service and he ultimately motioned Henry into a closet which had a trap door, a secret door behind the closet.
[01:42:15.698 --> 01:42:25.309]  And there was a bunch of monitors in this secret room and Craig Spence hit a couple of buttons and Henry saw himself talking about his escort service.
[01:42:25.349 --> 01:42:33.919]  So anybody that was even talking about illicit things in Craig Spence's home, like Henry, was susceptible to being blackmailed.
[01:42:34.159 --> 01:42:37.781]  Now, that's the CIA with stuff 25, 30 years ago.
[01:42:38.281 --> 01:42:51.449]  Imagine with the eye of God, as they call it, these systems that can dial into all your smartphones, all your computers, all your appliances, crack what you're doing, or plant things in the digital record, what they're doing with this.
[01:42:52.750 --> 01:43:01.855]  This is just unbelievable, and it's so criminal, it's so antithetical to a free society.
[01:43:02.847 --> 01:43:09.386]  And with the election season coming up, remember when they bring up all these private scandals, they're total diversions from the policies.
[01:43:10.168 --> 01:43:11.089]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:43:11.269 --> 01:43:18.936]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lifted weights five days a week, I could swim two, three miles.
[01:43:19.296 --> 01:43:22.219]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[01:43:22.459 --> 01:43:24.021]  I started an access television show.
[01:43:24.421 --> 01:43:29.205]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[01:43:29.806 --> 01:43:32.649]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[01:43:33.169 --> 01:43:38.893]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[01:43:39.253 --> 01:43:44.096]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[01:43:44.496 --> 01:43:49.379]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[01:43:49.659 --> 01:43:56.743]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Group for InfoWarsLife.com, the results were incredible.

[01:44:39.704 --> 01:44:41.005]  People are assaulting us.
[01:44:41.025 --> 01:44:43.166]  Targeting of patriots engaged.

[01:44:45.807 --> 01:44:49.689]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:47:11.895 --> 01:47:14.597]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.921 --> 01:47:22.803]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[01:47:23.043 --> 01:47:26.006]  Broke my leg in the Santa Fe.
[01:47:28.107 --> 01:47:30.429]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend.
[01:47:33.995 --> 01:47:40.083]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[01:47:40.383 --> 01:47:44.548]  We're trying to investigate and understand why our country is degenerating so quickly.
[01:47:45.209 --> 01:47:50.015]  We have Henry W. Vinson and co-author Nick Bryan on with his Confessions of a D.C.
[01:47:50.055 --> 01:47:50.355]  Madam.
[01:47:52.079 --> 01:47:56.843]  Gentlemen, where is the best place for folks to get the book, to really dig into this and understand it?
[01:47:56.883 --> 01:48:00.987]  It's very well documented, full of photos, graphics, news articles, you name it.
[01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:11.196]  Well, you can go to my website, henryvinson.com, or amazon.com, or Barnes & Noble.
[01:48:11.903 --> 01:48:15.425]  Alright, let me run through some of these questions that I want to get to here.
[01:48:16.726 --> 01:48:21.048]  You were initially glad to have Greta Van Cistern as your defense attorney, but not for long.
[01:48:21.628 --> 01:48:24.470]  What changed her tactics with your case?
[01:48:24.490 --> 01:48:28.412]  I mean, there's a lot of big players involved in this, and boy, look how she got rewarded.
[01:48:29.853 --> 01:48:39.637]  I was very disappointed with the way Greta Van Susteren represented me because the government accomplishes two objectives when she was my attorney, my silence and imprisonment.
[01:48:40.137 --> 01:48:46.480]  And at the onset of my case, she filed an 11-page motion to mandate the release of my clientele list.
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:47.840]  That's a good question.
[01:49:14.069 --> 01:49:17.211]  And the government used a rather disingenuous argument.
[01:49:17.312 --> 01:49:20.234]  They were worried about embarrassing the client.
[01:49:20.854 --> 01:49:22.735]  So, shortly after the U.S.
[01:49:22.775 --> 01:49:37.286]  attorney and the judge ruled that the clientele list could not be disclosed, Greta started to change her tune and she was urging me to take a plea agreement, which was five years in prison.
[01:49:37.626 --> 01:49:40.568]  Ultimately, I did enter into a plea agreement with the government.
[01:49:41.241 --> 01:49:43.983]  And I spent days being debriefed by the government officials.
[01:49:44.223 --> 01:49:48.506]  I told them everything I knew, everything I'd witnessed, which was very incriminating.
[01:49:48.746 --> 01:49:54.390]  And Greta, unbelievably, didn't attend any of the debriefings where I was incriminating myself.
[01:49:55.330 --> 01:49:55.570]  Wow.
[01:49:55.971 --> 01:49:57.712]  You've kept your story quiet for so long.
[01:49:57.792 --> 01:49:59.253]  Why are you now breaking your silence?
[01:50:00.782 --> 01:50:08.747]  Well, after all these years, I've undergone a 25-year character assassination by the media, and I just wanted to tell my side of the story.
[01:50:08.767 --> 01:50:09.748]  It's never been told.
[01:50:09.828 --> 01:50:23.496]  But second, I do believe the American political system has become a wayward aberration of the ideas it was built upon, and I believe that blackmail plays a much more integral role in hijacking our political system than what most people know.
[01:50:23.516 --> 01:50:23.676]  Sure.
[01:50:25.666 --> 01:50:26.147]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:50:26.187 --> 01:50:29.752]  Americans aren't aware because the media does not report on it.
[01:50:29.792 --> 01:50:34.198]  Sure, do you think your sexual orientation played a role in how zealously they went after you?
[01:50:34.218 --> 01:50:37.302]  I mean, you can go to Las Vegas and there's prostitute ads on TV.
[01:50:37.322 --> 01:50:42.089]  I mean, it's just so hypocritical that they selectively target certain groups.
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:44.220]  Well, I do.
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:56.387]  I think that my sexual orientation, because I ran a gay escort service during the Reagan and Bush administration, and many of the politicians and power brokers that I provided with escorts were closeted Republicans.
[01:50:56.887 --> 01:51:08.013]  And it would have been a death knell to their careers if it came out that they were soliciting... Sure, so they wanted to shut you up even though you hadn't spoken out, even though it was the CIA that was releasing all this stuff, you were getting the blame.
[01:51:08.453 --> 01:51:09.614]  Let me expand on that.
[01:51:11.511 --> 01:51:19.177]  What percentage, I know it's a guesstimation, dead reckoning, what percentage of Congress would you say is bisexual or gay?
[01:51:21.439 --> 01:51:29.585]  Well, we've had a lot of clients, I would venture 30-40% of them, we've had a lot of clients.
[01:51:30.026 --> 01:51:32.227]  Yeah, that's the number I've gotten from a lot of other bigwigs, about 30-40%.
[01:51:34.898 --> 01:51:40.625]  Finally, and then you can have the floor here at the end with you and your guest, your co-author.
[01:51:41.386 --> 01:51:48.334]  In running a gay escort service, you were exposed to many incredible scenes, heavy drug use, orgies, pedophilic-type fantasies, just to name a few.
[01:51:48.695 --> 01:51:52.920]  What was some of the more sinister things you were exposed to during your time as a madam?
[01:51:54.175 --> 01:52:02.845]  I think the most disturbing and sinister thing I was exposed to was the fact that politicians and power brokers were provided with children, if they had those inclinations.
[01:52:03.406 --> 01:52:09.453]  I was consistently pressured by DC power brokers to provide child prostitutes to their power broker cronies.
[01:52:09.973 --> 01:52:12.936]  But I refuse to have anything to do with child prostitution.
[01:52:13.456 --> 01:52:23.244]  And the federal government was aware of the facts because I told my government debriefers about an interstate pedophile network that was providing DC politicians and powerbrokers with children.
[01:52:23.344 --> 01:52:27.128]  Sure, the finders got exposed and the government was involved in that and they covered it up.
[01:52:28.088 --> 01:52:30.210]  Look at... This network was Larry King's breakthrough.
[01:52:32.290 --> 01:52:32.670]  Absolutely.
[01:52:32.730 --> 01:52:34.551]  I mean, that's a separate network.
[01:52:35.031 --> 01:52:35.491]  Absolutely.
[01:52:35.511 --> 01:52:36.211]  We're going to get into that.
[01:52:36.291 --> 01:52:37.512]  I want you to spend a few minutes on that.
[01:52:37.532 --> 01:52:40.853]  We'll both have you back to expand from this area in D.C.
[01:52:41.273 --> 01:52:44.154]  out to the really nasty underbelly of this.
[01:52:44.254 --> 01:52:55.397]  But what about the famous gay congressman, Barney Frank, who didn't get in trouble, but it turned out his boyfriend was running an underage, cowboy network, you know, 14-year-olds and stuff out of his house?
[01:52:55.718 --> 01:52:57.078]  Three-story Georgetown deal.
[01:52:57.238 --> 01:52:59.919]  That was on the news back in the 80s and 90s as well.
[01:53:01.072 --> 01:53:03.473]  Henry employed Barney Frank's lover.
[01:53:04.634 --> 01:53:08.215]  He worked for Henry, Frank Joby.
[01:53:08.776 --> 01:53:15.899]  That's right, Frank Joby was the one on those newscasts I've seen from the archives and it's just crazy.
[01:53:15.919 --> 01:53:21.682]  Remember a few years ago before Frank retired, Barney Frank, he said, look, mess with me, I'm outing you all.
[01:53:21.742 --> 01:53:24.363]  And remember how quick they backed off on the corruption investigation?
[01:53:26.244 --> 01:53:29.766]  And he was also one of the principal cheerleaders for the bailout.
[01:53:30.259 --> 01:53:31.540]  Which is kind of interesting.
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:36.923]  He went against his constituency and really was a big cheerleader for the bailout.
[01:53:37.064 --> 01:53:41.406]  So I think Barney probably had some skeletons in his closet also.
[01:53:41.707 --> 01:53:43.268]  Other than just his homosexuality.
[01:53:44.668 --> 01:53:45.169]  Good God.
[01:53:46.824 --> 01:53:48.745]  And that's investigative reporter Nick Bryant.
[01:53:49.205 --> 01:53:51.686]  Nick, I want to give you both about two or three minutes here at the end.
[01:53:51.706 --> 01:54:00.109]  We'll have you back soon on the nightly news, you know, uninterrupted to really break this down and we can then, you know, document everything for the TV audience and actually show people news articles.
[01:54:00.169 --> 01:54:03.310]  But spend a few minutes on where the rabbit hole goes.
[01:54:03.370 --> 01:54:03.810]  Nick Bryant.
[01:54:05.970 --> 01:54:10.751]  Well, the rabbit hole goes all the way up to the pinnacle of the Bush administration.
[01:54:11.151 --> 01:54:12.412]  And it's kind of interesting.
[01:54:12.832 --> 01:54:16.993]  What brought Henry down was he was providing escorts to Donald Gregg.
[01:54:17.993 --> 01:54:20.854]  And your audience might not know who Donald Gregg was.
[01:54:20.914 --> 01:54:23.235]  He was George H.W.
[01:54:23.375 --> 01:54:27.316]  Bush's national security advisor when Bush was the vice president.
[01:54:27.876 --> 01:54:32.497]  And Donald Gregg was getting gay escorts from Henry on his government-issued MasterCard.
[01:54:33.567 --> 01:54:42.694]  And a GAO employee called Henry because they were running these credit cards through a funeral service, a funeral merchant account.
[01:54:43.354 --> 01:54:50.940]  So a GAO employee called Henry up and asked him why Donald Gregg was purchasing so many funeral accessories from him.
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:55:02.508]  And so Henry said that, told the GAO employee, government accounting office employee, that that was kind of a personal matter with Donald Gregg and that she should talk to Donald Gregg about it.
[01:55:03.524 --> 01:55:07.125]  And then Henry called Craig Spence and said, the G.E.O.
[01:55:07.226 --> 01:55:12.908]  is calling me about Donald Gregg racking up all these funeral accessories on his government-issued credit card.
[01:55:13.588 --> 01:55:22.552]  And Spence invited Henry to his place, and there, waiting for Henry, was Craig Spence and a member of George H.W.
[01:55:22.592 --> 01:55:23.472]  Bush's cabinet.
[01:55:24.102 --> 01:55:36.833]  And they told Henry that they wanted him to cover for Donald Gregg, and he refused to cover for Donald Gregg, who ultimately became the ambassador to South Korea when Bush ascended to the presidency.
[01:55:37.274 --> 01:55:41.978]  And Henry was given a threat by a cabinet member, who was obviously part of this network.
[01:55:42.519 --> 01:55:47.323]  And then shortly thereafter, the Secret Service raided Henry, and that's when all his problems started.
[01:55:48.456 --> 01:55:52.638]  Well, all I know is that Congress is compromised.
[01:55:52.698 --> 01:55:56.240]  They're doing things that are against the country, against themselves, against common sense.
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:01.582]  And it is just a giant disaster, a giant mess.
[01:56:02.543 --> 01:56:03.823]  How do we fix this?
[01:56:04.283 --> 01:56:06.304]  How do we turn this around, Henry W. Vinson?
[01:56:08.585 --> 01:56:11.066]  Well, I think we turn it around by exposing it.
[01:56:13.148 --> 01:56:20.229]  But 90% of the media is controlled by five major corporations, so the media does not publish a lot of these things.
[01:56:20.729 --> 01:56:25.750]  And of course, the federal government has a greater dexterity to cover up sex scandals in Washington, D.C.
[01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:28.851]  because the federal government is the U.S.
[01:56:28.931 --> 01:56:29.871]  attorney for D.C.
[01:56:29.911 --> 01:56:31.371]  who prosecutes all D.C.
[01:56:31.411 --> 01:56:40.253]  crimes, is appointed by the president, the FBI and Secret Service are also minions of the executive branch, and Congress controls the budget of D.C.'
[01:56:40.233 --> 01:56:41.873]  's Metropolitan Police Department.
[01:56:42.453 --> 01:56:43.394]  So, D.C.
[01:56:43.494 --> 01:56:45.575]  is, everything that happens in D.C.
[01:56:45.635 --> 01:56:47.196]  is very usually covered up.
[01:56:48.316 --> 01:56:49.117]  Kind of like Vegas.
[01:56:49.137 --> 01:56:52.818]  What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but that's not really true.
[01:56:52.898 --> 01:56:54.059]  It's being used for blackmail.
[01:56:54.479 --> 01:57:05.065]  I remember having Senator DeCamp on, probably 15 years ago, and hitting delay and delay and delay, because he was saying Boys Town, and it hadn't come out yet, and that Penn State was a pedophile ring.
[01:57:05.885 --> 01:57:07.906]  And I told him, sir, you can't talk like that on air.
[01:57:07.946 --> 01:57:08.686]  It hadn't been in the news.
[01:57:08.706 --> 01:57:09.426]  I'm not going to cover it.
[01:57:09.786 --> 01:57:12.267]  I just cover stuff that's pretty much already there or we break it ourselves.
[01:57:12.847 --> 01:57:15.068]  We don't speculate very often, very rarely.
[01:57:15.828 --> 01:57:20.870]  And then years later, it all comes out and we all know Sandusky was just one level of this.
[01:57:21.550 --> 01:57:24.031]  I mean, my God, I hate to think how deep this goes.
[01:57:24.111 --> 01:57:24.671]  It's crazy.
[01:57:26.650 --> 01:57:32.034]  Well, uh, the American ruling class probably would make Caligula envious at this point.
[01:57:32.434 --> 01:57:34.055]  And, uh, Washington, D.C.
[01:57:34.115 --> 01:57:36.297]  is certainly a Babylon unto itself.
[01:57:36.617 --> 01:57:36.917]  It is.
[01:57:37.037 --> 01:57:37.798]  It is.
[01:57:38.559 --> 01:57:41.461]  Listen, Mr. Vinson, Mr. Bryant, thank you so much for your courage.
[01:57:41.481 --> 01:57:43.002]  People should get the book, Confessions of an E.C.
[01:57:43.042 --> 01:57:43.302]  Madam.
[01:57:43.542 --> 01:57:45.063]  I want to have you back up in the near future.
[01:57:45.564 --> 01:57:46.864]  Have a good rest of your Sunday evening.
[01:57:46.885 --> 01:57:47.225]  Be safe.
[01:57:48.373 --> 01:57:49.355]  All right, folks, I'm out of time.
[01:57:49.395 --> 01:57:50.277]  Great job to the crew.
[01:57:50.297 --> 01:57:52.102]  I didn't get to some of the news.
[01:57:52.442 --> 01:57:56.752]  Tomorrow, 11 a.m., Lord willing, we'll be on the air with the weekday transmission.
[01:57:56.772 --> 01:57:57.474]  Please spread the word.
[01:57:59.910 --> 01:58:04.912]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.

[01:58:26.901 --> 01:58:28.223]  Alex Jones here.
[01:58:28.383 --> 01:58:39.732]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:58:39.992 --> 01:58:43.495]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:58:43.775 --> 01:58:51.781]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[01:58:52.141 --> 01:58:54.423]  Visit Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:58:54.443 --> 01:58:55.483]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:02.737 --> 01:59:12.139]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:59:12.479 --> 01:59:15.039]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:18.520]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:24.742]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
