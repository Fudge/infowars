[00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:13.940]  The FBI has arrested a pair of ISIS wannabes in Mississippi.
[00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:20.026]  The newlyweds, allegedly claimed via social media, they plan to travel to Syria and join ISIS.
[00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:24.610]  This follows the arrest of another ISIS wannabe in New Jersey earlier this week.
[00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:33.117]  This latest incident follows a now well-established pattern, engaging in online conversations with FBI agents posing as terrorists.
[00:00:33.477 --> 00:00:37.640]  In May, declassified defense documents from 2012 revealed the U.S.
[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:45.204]  and its partners in the Gulf states and Turkey supported the Islamic State and planned to establish a Salafist principality in Syria.
[00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:51.788]  And in 2011, a report revealed the FBI organizes nearly all terror plots in the U.S.
[00:00:52.228 --> 00:00:56.091]  Can the federal government take credit for saving us from a plot of its own creation?
[00:00:56.431 --> 00:01:01.074]  The FBI has foiled about 17 plots to kill Americans during the past 10 years.
[00:01:01.534 --> 00:01:04.176]  They all have a common and reprehensible thread.
[00:01:04.616 --> 00:01:09.360]  They were planned, plotted, controlled, and carried out by the federal government itself.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:21.708]  FBI agents and operatives find suspects that could potentially carry out lone wolf attacks, and then more or less encourage them to do so, only to bust them before any of the events fully materialize.
[00:01:22.225 --> 00:01:34.832]  If you're submitting budget proposals for a law enforcement agency, for an intelligence agency, you're not going to submit the proposal that we won the war on terror and everything's great because the first thing that's going to happen is your budget's going to be cut in half.
[00:01:35.713 --> 00:01:40.435]  You know, it's my opposite of Jesse Jackson's keep hope alive.
[00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:41.236]  It's keep fear alive.
[00:01:42.857 --> 00:01:43.357]  Keep it alive.
