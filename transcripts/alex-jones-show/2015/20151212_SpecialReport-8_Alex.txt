[00:00:11.763 --> 00:00:19.868]  Mushrooming numbers of displaced people across the globe have now reached levels higher than at any time in recorded history.
[00:00:20.168 --> 00:00:28.813]  The New York Times reports the United Nations claims that nearly 60 million people have been driven from their homes by war and persecution.
[00:00:29.053 --> 00:00:39.142]  An unprecedented global exodus that has burdened fragile countries with waves of newcomers and littered deserts and seas with the bodies of those who died trying to reach safety.
[00:00:39.462 --> 00:00:49.611]  Europe is being transformed overnight by the sovereign decimating socialist policies spearheaded by the EU immigration invasion leading German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
[00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:55.876]  Merkel recently bent to the wave of immigration critics when she voiced support for transit zones.
[00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:56.456]  We're good to go!
[00:01:20.775 --> 00:01:27.881]  is attributing the source of the soft invasion of cultural devastation to billionaire George Soros and his circle of activists.
[00:01:28.282 --> 00:01:38.551]  Bloomberg reports Soros fired back, claiming Prime Minister Orban treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle.
[00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:46.538]  Soros said, our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle.
[00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:57.132]  Back in the United States, President Obama, a key member of Soros' activist circle, has been quietly pursuing a four-option plan to allow work permits to illegals.
[00:01:57.532 --> 00:02:14.478]  Regardless of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals injunction in order to review the constitutionality of Obama's DHS enforcement nullification initiatives, The Hill reports a leaked memo reveals the first option as providing EADs, or Employment Authorization Documents.
[00:02:14.918 --> 00:02:31.891]  Or work permits to all individuals living in the United States, including illegal aliens, visa overstayers, and H-1B guest workers, while Option 4 provides EADs only to those on certain unexpired non-immigration visas.
[00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:44.501]  Giving EADs to any of the covered individuals, however, is in direct violation of Congress's Immigration and Nationality Act, and works to dramatically subvert our carefully wrought visa system.
[00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:54.967]  These plans to issue work permits to DAPA and expanded DACA programs were challenged by 26 states and frozen by Texas federal judge Andrew Hainan.
[00:02:55.327 --> 00:02:58.609]  But that isn't stopping Obama, who has a phone and a pen.
[00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:11.976]  A president hell-bent on awarding 12 million people that have violated our immigration laws and introduced waves of criminal activity into the United States, similar to the skyrocketing crime-laden hidden hell pit over in Europe.
[00:03:12.216 --> 00:03:27.229]  A carefully executed, media-biased, sovereign, shocking ocean of non-naturalized immigrants with zero knowledge of the laws and culture of the new lands they are now inhabiting, demanding to be met with the promise of a new life that doesn't exist.
[00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:39.300]  The cloward-piven strategy to break the back of the welfare system, in turn forcing a new world order-led socialist regime offering a guaranteed annual income, is accelerating.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:53.390]  2016 is shaping up to be the year President Obama completely takes the gloves off, destroying the sovereignty and ignoring the checks and balances of our government with impunity, while his European counterparts lead the way.
[00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.151]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:04:03.223 --> 00:04:09.349]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:12.692]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.

[00:04:44.257 --> 00:04:45.298]  It's a war against the truth.
