[00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:18.273]  The Associated Press tried to corner Senator Rand Paul on Abortion Wednesday by asking him to state definitively which exceptions to a ban he'd support.
[00:00:18.754 --> 00:00:27.862]  When Paul danced around the question, the AP dutifully sent the story out, hoping that the rest of the media would continue asking him about his stance.
[00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:31.946]  And that's exactly what happened at a presser yesterday afternoon.
[00:00:32.326 --> 00:00:34.128]  But this time, Paul was ready for them.
[00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:36.888]  I just want to know where you do stay on exemptions.
[00:00:36.908 --> 00:00:38.709]  Should there be any exemptions for abortion or not?
[00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:40.589]  What's the DNC say?
[00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:46.090]  Why don't we ask the DNC, is it okay to kill a 7-pound baby in the uterus?
[00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:54.312]  You go back and you ask Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she's okay with killing a 7-pound baby that is just not yet born yet.
[00:00:54.732 --> 00:00:59.793]  Ask her when life begins, and you ask Debbie when she's willing to protect life.
[00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.573]  When you get an answer from Debbie, come back.
[00:01:02.213 --> 00:01:09.101]  The DNC head responded rather quickly in an emailed statement Wasserman Schultz said, Here's an answer.
[00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:14.827]  I support letting women and their doctors make this decision without government getting involved.
[00:01:15.148 --> 00:01:15.588]  Period.
[00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:16.589]  End of story.
[00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.571]  Social media was on fire.
[00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:24.637]  People quickly responded asking if the Democratic Party was united in this extreme stance.
[00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:34.066]  After all, if you say you want abortion handled without government getting involved, it means you want zero government restrictions, right?
[00:01:34.086 --> 00:01:36.408]  I mean, well, except for those government subsidies.
[00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.132]  Senator Paul then crushed it with this reply.
[00:01:41.027 --> 00:01:45.528]  Well, it sounds like her answer is yes, that she's okay with killing a seven-pound baby.
[00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:51.150]  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you approach the abortion debate with a partisan media.
