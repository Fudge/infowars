[00:00:00.693 --> 00:00:04.251]  And your support is helping us defend liberty worldwide.
[00:00:15.936 --> 00:00:20.137]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:20.777 --> 00:00:21.577]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:23.238]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.918 --> 00:00:27.559]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.180]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:53.891 --> 00:00:58.954]  Migrant, immigrant, illegal alien, any way you slice it, it all adds up to the same thing.
[00:00:59.274 --> 00:01:06.438]  Foreigners fast-tracked into countries with no knowledge of how that country's culture and laws apply to them.
[00:01:06.638 --> 00:01:11.700]  But not all of these people belong to the fleeing masses streaming across European and U.S.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.181]  borders.
[00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:20.445]  Recently, these scumbags from Qatar decided to drive their exotic cars at top speeds around a quiet Beverly Hills neighborhood.
[00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:22.702]  Yeah.
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:51.984]  Regardless of stop signs, kids riding bikes, people strolling around, speed limits, when the police were called, the Cutter Nationals, who could have easily driven their cars to the nearest racetrack, told the police to go F themselves and claimed diplomatic immunity.
[00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:57.325]  Journalist Jacob Rogers says he tried to ask this man why they were racing and endangering lives.
[00:01:57.425 --> 00:01:57.825]  Get out.
[00:01:57.845 --> 00:01:58.605]  Do you have anything to say?
[00:01:59.085 --> 00:01:59.345]  Yeah.
[00:01:59.505 --> 00:02:01.446]  When Rogers tried again another time.
[00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:04.528]  And he said, well, F America, and he threw a cigarette at me.
[00:02:05.108 --> 00:02:08.630]  And that was before he indicated that he could kill me and get away with it.
[00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.952]  Beverly Hills police were called to the scene, but no arrests were made.
[00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:18.296]  Investigators say they're now trying to confirm whether any laws were broken and are looking into exactly who the drivers are.
[00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:22.138]  Police say they're from the country of Qatar and may have diplomatic immunity.
[00:02:22.438 --> 00:02:34.781]  Meanwhile, President Obama is announcing a plan to bring in 70,000 this year, 85,000 next year, and 100,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 to America.
[00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:41.622]  A veritable treasure trove of potential false flag, anti-Christian, America-hating chaos.
[00:02:42.042 --> 00:02:51.384]  While Qatar and other Persian Gulf states, just a stone's throw away from Syria, are offering to take in ZERO refugees from Syria.
[00:02:51.704 --> 00:03:07.099]  I wonder if Madam Winberg would agree with me that Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States should be doing more to set up camps in Turkey rather than displace large numbers of people, that they should be helping their fellow Muslims.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.984]  I think it's a disgrace that they are not doing more and that Britain is doing more than any of them.
[00:03:12.424 --> 00:03:14.006]  I wonder if she agrees with me about that.
[00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:26.199]  United Arab Emirates' only defense is that they gave 530 million in aid, which is just a drop in the bucket compared to the UAE's GDP of 570 billion per year.
[00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:41.689]  Saudi Arabia's insulting solution is to blanket Germany with 200 mosques to meet the needs of the flow of Muslims into the most populous destination for immigrants, second only to the United States, Germany, a country with a strong Christian base.
[00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:45.932]  Basically the translation is, your women are ours.
[00:03:45.972 --> 00:03:47.352]  Top imam of Jerusalem.
[00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.912]  It's not going to be just the poor, unwashed, and huddled masses seeking shelter from the globalist-funded ISIS storm.
[00:04:20.152 --> 00:04:32.956]  Prepare yourself to see more idiots like these disrespecting American values, disregarding our laws, and getting away with it.
[00:04:38.977 --> 00:04:41.058]  Excellent report by John Bowne.
[00:04:41.098 --> 00:04:42.018]  We are live.
[00:04:42.038 --> 00:04:45.039]  We're going to have open phones throughout the broadcast today.
[00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:47.980]  Tons of vital news and information straight ahead.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.020]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:58.244]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and you have found the tip of the spear of common sense, pro-human, pro-sovereignty, pro-family, pro-self-defense.
[00:04:58.624 --> 00:05:01.165]  Take humans to the next level launch base.
[00:05:01.505 --> 00:05:05.706]  We call it the Info War, and it is the answer to the New World Order.
[00:05:06.146 --> 00:05:06.506]  It is 1776.
[00:05:09.966 --> 00:05:12.607]  Breaking now at InfoWars.com Top Imam!
[00:05:12.847 --> 00:05:24.113]  Muslim Migrants Should Breed With Europeans To Conquer Their Countries Sheikh Mohammed Aid recently gave a speech in which he asserted that Muslims should use the migrant crisis to breed with European citizens to conquer their countries.
[00:05:24.393 --> 00:05:31.877]  Aid stated that European countries were not rolling out the red carpet for migrants because they were compassionate, but because Europe was in dire need of a new source of labor.
[00:05:32.037 --> 00:05:34.118]  Soon we will trample them underfoot, Allah willing.
[00:05:34.258 --> 00:05:44.183]  He said, the Imam's statements directly echo a philosophy born in the early 20th century called the Kalergi Plan, devised by an Austrian diplomat named Richard Codenhove-Kalergi.
[00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:46.904]  He writes, the band of the future will be of mixed race.
[00:05:47.124 --> 00:05:52.227]  Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time and prejudice.
[00:05:52.407 --> 00:05:59.891]  The Eurasian-Negroid race of the future, similar in appearance to that of ancient Egyptians, will replace the diversity of peoples with the diversity of individuals.
[00:06:00.211 --> 00:06:03.054]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:03.215 --> 00:06:06.238]  We're holding the Operation Money Bomb specials over till the end of the weekend.
[00:06:06.378 --> 00:06:09.402]  So log on now to InfoWars.com forward slash money bomb.
[00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:10.983]  It's now more clear than ever.
[00:06:11.184 --> 00:06:14.708]  The Globalists have launched a planetary destabilization plan.
[00:06:15.128 --> 00:06:16.568]  We're at the InfoWars operation.
[00:06:16.728 --> 00:06:18.589]  We hope and pray that this is not the case.
[00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:22.710]  But the signs of things deteriorating around the world are unmistakable.
[00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:29.512]  For many years, I've been working with MyPatriotSupply, and we have now developed a private label called InfoWars Select.
[00:06:29.672 --> 00:06:34.434]  Look, it's important to have firearms and water filtration during a collapse, but you've also got to have food.
[00:06:34.454 --> 00:06:42.176]  InfoWars Select is a wide variety of their highest quality packages at the lowest price they have ever offered before.
[00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:42.676]  I think so.
[00:07:09.714 --> 00:07:13.517]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[00:07:13.817 --> 00:07:27.206]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up supplies all over the world so prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:36.109]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:07:36.149 --> 00:07:37.909]  This is the good halogen.
[00:07:37.989 --> 00:07:40.750]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:52.834]  Now we at InfoWarsLife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure, 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:07:53.074 --> 00:07:54.334]  Watch the informational videos
[00:07:54.534 --> 00:08:00.776]  At Infowarslife.com, discover how transformational pure iodine can be for you and your family.
[00:08:00.976 --> 00:08:01.897]  Folks, this isn't hype.
[00:08:02.037 --> 00:08:06.218]  Read the reviews for yourself at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:08:06.318 --> 00:08:15.882]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:08:16.002 --> 00:08:17.142]  Let me think, just let me think.
[00:08:17.162 --> 00:08:22.745]  I suspect even now orders are being shouts into telephones and men with guns will still be on their way.
[00:08:22.765 --> 00:08:23.505]  It's Chancellor Settler.
[00:08:25.848 --> 00:08:31.872]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:08:32.432 --> 00:08:35.614]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:43.214]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:08:43.254 --> 00:08:44.215]  You designed it, sir.
[00:08:44.275 --> 00:08:45.195]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:08:45.215 --> 00:08:46.616]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:08:46.856 --> 00:08:50.319]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[00:08:50.759 --> 00:09:00.726]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and subverting your submission.
[00:09:00.746 --> 00:09:01.307]  We need cameras.
[00:09:01.607 --> 00:09:02.328]  How did this happen?
[00:09:03.068 --> 00:09:03.829]  Who's to blame?
[00:09:04.824 --> 00:09:07.429]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:09.452]  They will be held accountable.
[00:09:09.793 --> 00:09:15.263]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.241]  I know why you did it.
[00:09:18.442 --> 00:09:19.522]  I know you were afraid.
[00:09:19.943 --> 00:09:21.664]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:09:21.684 --> 00:09:21.744]  War?
[00:09:21.944 --> 00:09:22.485]  Terror?
[00:09:22.565 --> 00:09:23.225]  Disease?
[00:09:23.886 --> 00:09:29.750]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:09:30.331 --> 00:09:36.095]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:09:36.716 --> 00:09:42.880]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:50.788]  There is a war.
[00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:52.229]  It's happening now.
[00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:54.950]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.291]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:09:58.111 --> 00:09:59.551]  We are the resistance.
[00:10:00.011 --> 00:10:01.852]  We are the Infowar.
[00:10:06.233 --> 00:10:07.834]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:12.235]  We're broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday, the 22nd day of September 2015.
[00:10:14.773 --> 00:10:29.557]  We do have some guests joining us for about 30 minutes at the start of the next hour, Diamond and Silk, the two very entertaining and informative black ladies that have been so viral on the internet promoting Donald Trump.
[00:10:29.978 --> 00:10:37.780]  I wanted to get them on the show so they'll be popping in with us to talk all things Donald Trump and election 2016 for 30 minutes at the start of the next hour.
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.001]  We will have open phones throughout the full three hours today.
[00:10:41.761 --> 00:10:44.382]  And we will cover, obviously, the massive amounts of news.
[00:10:45.262 --> 00:10:53.444]  There is a story up at the top of the Drudge Report.
[00:10:54.584 --> 00:10:56.845]  And we'll put that image on screen for TV viewers.
[00:10:57.445 --> 00:11:03.306]  Book says that Hillary Clinton is sick and that she has serious medical problems.
[00:11:03.346 --> 00:11:05.107]  Well, you can look at her.
[00:11:06.878 --> 00:11:11.421]  And tell that she's obviously has some serious medical issues.
[00:11:11.481 --> 00:11:15.003]  She's collapsed in public repeatedly over the years.
[00:11:15.063 --> 00:11:16.444]  She has all sorts of problems.
[00:11:16.865 --> 00:11:19.947]  But I'll tell you this, she's sick in the head is what she really is.
[00:11:20.707 --> 00:11:26.551]  She is an incredibly corrupt, evil person and Radar Online is reporting on that.
[00:11:26.631 --> 00:11:35.097]  So whether she's deathly ill or whether she has health problems that she can surmount really doesn't matter to me one way or the other.
[00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:46.939]  Because she is politically a very anti-American person obsessed with bringing this country down on record.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:12:04.451]  But it certainly adds to all of her woes that she looks so sick, acts so sick, and if you look at the photo of her in the back of a car when she doesn't have her makeup on, it looks like basically a cross between Alistair Crowley
[00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:18.631]  And Mr. Burns from the Simpsons, if we can punch that up on screen, she looks like she's about 15, 20 years older than what she is, and that shows you what working for evil, I guess, will do to you.
[00:12:19.191 --> 00:12:24.375]  It's not that she has tiny wrinkles all around her lips or all around her eyes, it's what's in her eyes.
[00:12:25.416 --> 00:12:27.558]  How unhappy, how scared she looks.
[00:12:29.056 --> 00:12:31.758]  Because you can look at folks that have fought for good and fought for liberty.
[00:12:31.778 --> 00:12:34.319]  They may have wrinkles all over their face, but they're beautiful.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.061]  There's something empowering about a good person with wrinkles.
[00:12:37.281 --> 00:12:39.983]  And they have this light in their eyes when they're old.
[00:12:40.323 --> 00:12:42.544]  People that are good just get better as they get older.
[00:12:42.805 --> 00:12:46.707]  People that are evil just get more twisted and rot in front of everyone.
[00:12:47.207 --> 00:12:49.749]  And I don't take pleasure in watching Hillary Clinton rot.
[00:12:50.894 --> 00:12:58.584]  I wish that she wasn't given over to absolute abject wickedness, but she is now a totem, a signet, a figurehead, a masthead.
[00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:02.789]  She is the goddess of the modern feminist movement.
[00:13:03.951 --> 00:13:13.798]  And I can't think of a better symbol for them than the rotting, corrupt robber baron who tries to act like she's with the proletariat, she's with the grassroots, she's with the people.
[00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:22.105]  When she is beyond a purveyor and deliverer of astroturf, she has been involved in so many campaigns.
[00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.351]  Keeping drug prices high while she claims she's trying to keep them low.
[00:13:27.711 --> 00:13:30.772]  Involved shipping blood out of Arkansas for more than a decade.
[00:13:30.792 --> 00:13:35.413]  They knew every container of it had HIV, hepatitis A, B, and C in it.
[00:13:35.793 --> 00:13:40.875]  Knowing it was a death sentence, that all came out in the lawsuits from the Hemophiliac Society of Canada.
[00:13:41.135 --> 00:13:46.416]  Then they were firebombed, but not before Bayer was exposed in court premeditatedly doing it.
[00:13:46.897 --> 00:13:47.977]  These are ghouls.
[00:13:48.057 --> 00:13:49.037]  These are monsters.
[00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:51.618]  And I say that today opening up the broadcast because
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:14:05.442]  She's been in the news criticizing a major brokerage hedge fund manager increasing the price of an AIDS pill by 5,500 percent.
[00:14:06.142 --> 00:14:09.343]  So that's one snake criticizing another snake.
[00:14:10.043 --> 00:14:19.785]  And you look at the AIDS pills themselves, they're all part of a larger fraud for something that's a treatable condition from the research I've seen and the medical doctors we've had on the transmission.
[00:14:20.845 --> 00:14:24.346]  So, it is lies within lies within lies, obviously.
[00:14:25.126 --> 00:14:45.312]  Now, that said, every few weeks, there will be an article, there will be a story, there will be a scandal, there will be a story that through which you look through the crystal, through the scanner darkly, through the rose-colored glass, and instead of it darkening your view, it lightens your view.
[00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:55.687]  And I have stared through many a rose colored darkly, as we all have, but this Volkswagen, this people's wagon story.
[00:14:57.229 --> 00:15:08.778]  I love how they'll ban a teapot because someone thinks the reflection of the black top on the silver plating looks like a Hitler mustache.
[00:15:08.798 --> 00:15:11.500]  Remember that when JCPenney pulled the popular teapot?
[00:15:13.217 --> 00:15:16.483]  It's like seeing an elephant in the clouds or seeing Hitler in the clouds.
[00:15:16.603 --> 00:15:17.866]  You want to ban the cloud?
[00:15:18.587 --> 00:15:22.354]  Volkswagen was basically founded by Adolf Hitler.
[00:15:23.156 --> 00:15:25.139]  Hitler designed the Volkswagen.
[00:15:26.288 --> 00:15:27.549]  By the way, I've owned Volkswagens.
[00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:30.190]  Just because Hitler was involved in it, why do I care?
[00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.311]  If I like the car, I'll drive it.
[00:15:31.871 --> 00:15:33.852]  You know, the car is not inherently evil itself.
[00:15:33.872 --> 00:15:40.536]  I mean, if I was a pilot and had tons of money, I'd probably own some World War II British planes, U.S.
[00:15:40.616 --> 00:15:41.836]  and, you know, German.
[00:15:41.896 --> 00:15:46.299]  People have seen collectors flying German Messerschmitts and stuff.
[00:15:46.319 --> 00:15:48.220]  You know, these rich guys collect them and they freak out.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.881]  Oh my gosh, it's got the German Luftwaffe symbol!
[00:15:51.161 --> 00:15:52.182]  Grow up!
[00:15:52.382 --> 00:15:53.303]  Who cares?
[00:15:54.963 --> 00:15:55.644]  Who cares?
[00:15:57.082 --> 00:15:59.963]  So they're always looking for shades of what's racist.
[00:16:00.003 --> 00:16:02.304]  They're always looking for, you know, brown paper bags are evil.
[00:16:02.644 --> 00:16:03.804]  Mother and father is hurtful.
[00:16:05.085 --> 00:16:06.085]  But that's a side issue.
[00:16:07.265 --> 00:16:08.466]  Volkswagen scandal.
[00:16:08.486 --> 00:16:10.126]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to cover this.
[00:16:10.166 --> 00:16:12.147]  I want to really focus and really hit all the points.
[00:16:13.087 --> 00:16:16.248]  You look at this story, it exposes everything.
[00:16:16.968 --> 00:16:19.049]  The connections that it goes into.
[00:16:19.569 --> 00:16:21.810]  But here's the bottom line, and I'll elaborate bottom of the hour.
[00:16:24.571 --> 00:16:28.555]  The nature of smart technology is that it's built to game people.
[00:16:28.995 --> 00:16:30.496]  It's built to be a fraud.
[00:16:30.516 --> 00:16:35.301]  It is designed to run scams and be very hard to detect.
[00:16:36.582 --> 00:16:40.085]  Whether it's electronic voting machines or smart meters in your house.
[00:16:42.347 --> 00:16:47.572]  The first big brain trust I saw admitting what it was going to do back in the 90s was Enron.
[00:16:49.682 --> 00:16:59.505]  Inron had, quote, smart trading, which would charge you two, three billion dollars a day in one state alone like California, more for the power than what it cost.
[00:17:00.625 --> 00:17:06.947]  And it had fake trading computers overlaid with programs over the real trading programs.
[00:17:08.919 --> 00:17:12.820]  That were just fed numbers entered by Enron executives.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.101]  So it's a bunch of smoke and mirrors, basically, total fraud.
[00:17:16.401 --> 00:17:22.262]  And they would charge some days $3 billion extra per day in a gang rape of California.
[00:17:23.303 --> 00:17:33.005]  So you want to know what smart meters are, you want to know what smart appliances are, smart cars, self-driving cars, just think giant galactic screw job, the biggest on the planet.
[00:17:34.065 --> 00:17:35.246]  But I'm going to get to this at the bottom of the hour.
[00:17:35.266 --> 00:17:36.626]  I'm going to hit some other news first.
[00:17:38.089 --> 00:17:39.330]  But here's the deal.
[00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:46.414]  Technology isn't evil, but the people designing the modern technology are evil.
[00:17:48.116 --> 00:18:00.324]  And carbon taxes have always been about cheating the little guy, shutting down the little guy, taxing the little guy, tracking the little guy, and diverting from real environmental problems.
[00:18:01.366 --> 00:18:03.329]  Every major globalist corporation.
[00:18:03.489 --> 00:18:04.170]  Here's a prediction.
[00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:06.954]  Obama said we'll take 10,000 Syrians next year.
[00:18:07.455 --> 00:18:09.258]  I said he'll say 100,000 next week.
[00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:12.082]  Well, now it's 87,000, another 100,000, another 120,000, so it's over 300,000.
[00:18:12.122 --> 00:18:13.564]  It's worse than I said, but I know their playbook.
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.561]  I mean, it's just 101.
[00:18:20.742 --> 00:18:23.204]  I know exactly what they're going to do, because I've studied these criminals.
[00:18:23.825 --> 00:18:27.488]  They operate like you're completely stupid, deaf, dumb, and blind, and don't know what's going on.
[00:18:27.628 --> 00:18:31.772]  You just wake up to the scam they're running, admit they're running a scam on you, you'll know everything.
[00:18:31.792 --> 00:18:42.422]  You'll know how to make money in the stock market, you'll know how to deal with the police, you'll know how to make money in real estate, you'll just live an incredibly successful life, if you just aren't schmucks and admit the world government's gaming the living daylights out of you.
[00:18:43.271 --> 00:18:54.575]  Because all the smart people tune into this show, but all the other smart people that are globalists, they've just decided to cheat you and use the knowledge that you don't know and hope you never learn about it, because they don't want you in on how things really work.
[00:18:55.115 --> 00:19:00.137]  I'm not bragging, but you don't listen to this show at your absolute insane asylum detriment.
[00:19:01.278 --> 00:19:07.120]  I mean, I want you to win, I want you to succeed, I want your children to go to Alpha Centauri's.
[00:19:08.686 --> 00:19:10.787]  I want to break the dimensional gates.
[00:19:11.188 --> 00:19:12.389]  I want to go to the next level.
[00:19:12.689 --> 00:19:14.250]  I want to have a life extension.
[00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:19.333]  I want my children and their children to be fabulously wealthy and successful with your progeny.
[00:19:20.014 --> 00:19:21.435]  I got such goodwill for you.
[00:19:21.735 --> 00:19:22.696]  I'm in love with you.
[00:19:23.576 --> 00:19:29.240]  Please just wake up and step into God's blessings that God's ready to give us, but stop being chumps.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.101]  You got to admit evil exists.
[00:19:31.362 --> 00:19:32.742]  You got to admit it's going on.
[00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:36.245]  You got to organize against it instead of living in denial like a five-year-old.
[00:19:39.349 --> 00:19:43.434]  When you hear smart, think death.
[00:19:45.357 --> 00:19:54.268]  Because this is their technocracy rollout, and here's another prediction, just like I told you with the refugees, it'll be up to hundreds of thousands by next week, now it is, it'll be up to millions by next month.
[00:19:54.989 --> 00:19:55.750]  Because that's the plan.
[00:19:56.491 --> 00:19:57.232]  Here's the prediction.
[00:19:57.852 --> 00:19:58.053]  Other
[00:19:59.184 --> 00:20:02.365]  Car companies are going to be caught with the same program gaming everything.
[00:20:02.745 --> 00:20:04.706]  Because it's not meant for them.
[00:20:04.826 --> 00:20:06.626]  It's meant for us to screw us over.
[00:20:06.646 --> 00:20:07.426]  We'll be back.
[00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:08.547]  We'll break it all down.
[00:20:08.567 --> 00:20:09.727]  Stay with us.
[00:20:10.247 --> 00:20:16.569]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[00:20:16.969 --> 00:20:21.910]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[00:20:22.451 --> 00:20:23.571]  There's a change coming.
[00:20:24.211 --> 00:20:25.612]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:20:25.672 --> 00:20:27.353]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:46.122]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[00:20:46.603 --> 00:20:47.103]  They did.
[00:20:47.683 --> 00:20:52.127]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[00:20:52.747 --> 00:20:53.228]  They did.
[00:20:53.908 --> 00:20:57.191]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:20:57.751 --> 00:20:59.753]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:21:00.133 --> 00:21:01.314]  This will affect us all.

[00:24:07.158 --> 00:24:07.979]  Come and take it.
[00:24:21.025 --> 00:24:41.276]  I remember 25 years ago when I was first getting politically active and involved, when I was still in high school, a senior in high school, hearing the conservatives, real conservatives that I knew, Pat Buchanan type conservatives at meetings say, listen, it's not that we're against the homosexuals.
[00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:49.232]  It's that we're against the fact that it's part of a political movement to set the precedent to end the family.
[00:24:49.632 --> 00:24:54.354]  Then they would quote different books and different research papers that I later actually read for myself.
[00:24:55.754 --> 00:24:57.795]  That's why we can't use the word gay.
[00:24:58.475 --> 00:25:05.297]  They want to set the precedent, the people above this group, to control language, as George Orwell wrote.
[00:25:06.558 --> 00:25:07.818]  As George Orwell warned.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.981]  And next, after they're done with that, they're going to promote pedophilia.
[00:25:14.001 --> 00:25:18.463]  I remember being at this meeting.
[00:25:18.483 --> 00:25:20.824]  This guy was a local lawyer.
[00:25:20.844 --> 00:25:22.985]  He's pretty old.
[00:25:23.005 --> 00:25:23.865]  I wonder if he's still alive.
[00:25:24.506 --> 00:25:26.246]  He knew George Humphreys, the city council guy.
[00:25:26.286 --> 00:25:27.507]  They were all involved there.
[00:25:27.527 --> 00:25:31.488]  He goes, next, they're going to promote pedophilia.
[00:25:33.729 --> 00:25:37.411]  And then they're going to promote making you hand your children over to them.
[00:25:38.919 --> 00:25:43.242]  And I just cannot believe how on target paleo-conservatives and libertarians were.
[00:25:43.522 --> 00:25:46.524]  I mean, these guys, I go to these meetings, they knew everything.
[00:25:47.084 --> 00:25:53.468]  And they were successful, they were good in business, they were family men, they were city council people, they knew what they were talking about.
[00:25:53.808 --> 00:26:00.292]  And talking to the general public, it's like a god compared to a sheep or something.
[00:26:01.373 --> 00:26:03.374]  And these guys aren't gods, they're just informed.
[00:26:03.774 --> 00:26:06.776]  But compared to an uninformed buffoon,
[00:26:08.441 --> 00:26:09.282]  There's no comparison.
[00:26:09.522 --> 00:26:19.817]  And to see men and women who are aware of how things really work, but don't use the knowledge to screw people over, they use it to try to warn people.
[00:26:20.785 --> 00:26:22.125]  It's just a total dichotomy.
[00:26:22.865 --> 00:26:27.366]  Because most people that are awake to this decide to join with it.
[00:26:28.166 --> 00:26:34.948]  And I can't tell you how many times I've had these people laugh at me on air, off air, or in person, and say, you're never gonna beat us.
[00:26:35.308 --> 00:26:40.149]  Humanity's weak, and we're gonna use their weakness and take over, and you should just join us.
[00:26:40.229 --> 00:26:42.309]  I mean, it's so biblical.
[00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:47.090]  Well, I will never join the New World Order.
[00:26:49.249 --> 00:27:01.972]  And what it really comes down to is that they are a cult of power, a cult of manipulating words, a cult of dumbing people down, a cult of playing God, a cult of saying your wives belong to us, your husbands, your children.
[00:27:02.032 --> 00:27:03.752]  It's like these radical Islamic invaders.
[00:27:04.252 --> 00:27:07.533]  Their slogan is, your women are ours, and the rapes are beginning.
[00:27:09.893 --> 00:27:16.995]  And just to see America and the world prepared to be conquered by an alliance of trash,
[00:27:18.976 --> 00:27:20.217]  Makes me sick at my stomach.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.684]  But look at the headline up on Infowars.com.
[00:27:31.104 --> 00:27:33.546]  Salons hooked into the White House, hooked into Media Matters.
[00:27:33.866 --> 00:27:35.507]  They attack yours truly every week.
[00:27:35.968 --> 00:27:38.069]  They just misrepresent what we say and what we do.
[00:27:40.191 --> 00:27:43.032]  The Houston Chronicle is reporting today.
[00:27:43.052 --> 00:27:46.495]  I forgot to send it to the guys, but you can look it up.
[00:27:48.786 --> 00:27:51.407]  That I was saying the world was going to end in September.
[00:27:51.467 --> 00:27:52.187]  I never said that.
[00:27:53.387 --> 00:28:00.609]  We linked to different news articles in mainstream news where people were talking about the blood moons and a big time of change.
[00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:05.930]  And I said, I don't think it's the end of the world, but I think a lot of crazy stuff's happening with the Pope coming to speak and all the rest of it.
[00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.191]  We should be watchful.
[00:28:08.371 --> 00:28:12.132]  And that turns into the quote, Alex Jones said the world was going to end.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.743]  Then they go on to say, I'm basically a Russian agent, and that came from Russia.
[00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:24.209]  I mean, this is the fantastical lying, the lengths they have to go to.
[00:28:24.229 --> 00:28:26.651]  But back to Salon, I'm going to cover this more later.
[00:28:27.932 --> 00:28:31.315]  I saw this last night, and Kit Daniels wrote a story about it.
[00:28:31.656 --> 00:28:33.798]  Louder With Crowder has a story out on it today.
[00:28:37.824 --> 00:28:42.026]  The headline is, No Salon, I Don't Need to Understand the Plight of Pedophiles.
[00:28:42.566 --> 00:28:45.668]  And here's the headline, I'm a pedophile, but not a monster.
[00:28:46.028 --> 00:28:46.808]  And it's begun.
[00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:48.729]  So it's begun.
[00:28:49.469 --> 00:28:52.411]  They're accepted NGO, non-governmental organization of the UN.
[00:28:52.431 --> 00:29:03.696]  I mean, just like I said earlier this week, or last week, what do you think Jocelyn Elders, when she was the, that's why I've been bringing her back up, the Surgeon General,
[00:29:05.607 --> 00:29:07.768]  We need to help the little children masturbate.
[00:29:08.988 --> 00:29:12.749]  It's about weirdos sexually getting their hands on your kids.
[00:29:12.769 --> 00:29:14.649]  Because if they can do that, they can do anything.
[00:29:14.689 --> 00:29:16.149]  Forced inoculations, you name it.
[00:29:16.809 --> 00:29:27.292]  California passed a law two years ago saying we'll give your kids inoculations after age 11 if they say they want them because they are now free to make decisions.
[00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:27.512]  Really?
[00:29:27.552 --> 00:29:28.072]  To drink beer?
[00:29:29.059 --> 00:29:30.100]  Really, to have sex?
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:30.820]  No, they're not.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.021]  And that's contributing to the delinquency of minors.
[00:29:33.521 --> 00:29:35.862]  It's the government saying they're the parents now.
[00:29:37.863 --> 00:29:38.664]  And it's so sick.
[00:29:38.764 --> 00:29:43.786]  And when you realize that a large cadre of the people we're fighting is a pedophile cult.
[00:29:44.346 --> 00:29:49.809]  And they've taken over the major churches, the Vatican, the major universities, the major orphanages.
[00:29:50.829 --> 00:29:52.650]  It's a cult of pedophiles.
[00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:53.811]  That's what we face, folks.
[00:29:54.231 --> 00:29:56.732]  An army of pot-bellied pedophiles.
[00:29:57.112 --> 00:29:57.993]  As I said a decade ago.
[00:29:59.298 --> 00:30:02.288]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.308 --> 00:30:05.919]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.106 --> 00:30:12.767]  Breaking now at InfoWars.com Top Imam!
[00:30:13.007 --> 00:30:24.269]  Muslim Migrants Should Breed With Europeans To Conquer Their Countries Sheikh Mohammed Aid recently gave a speech in which he asserted that Muslims should use the migrant crisis to breed with European citizens to conquer their countries.
[00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:32.031]  Aid stated that European countries were not rolling out the red carpet for migrants because they were compassionate, but because Europe was in dire need of a new source of labor.
[00:30:32.191 --> 00:30:34.271]  Soon we will trample them underfoot, Allah willing.
[00:30:34.931 --> 00:30:44.335]  The Imam's statements directly echo a philosophy born in the early 20th century called the Kalergi Plan, devised by an Austrian diplomat named Richard Codenhove-Kalergi.
[00:30:44.495 --> 00:30:47.056]  He writes, The band of the future will be of mixed race.
[00:30:47.296 --> 00:30:52.399]  Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice.
[00:30:52.559 --> 00:31:00.042]  The Eurasian-Negroid race of the future, similar in appearance to that of ancient Egyptians, will replace the diversity of peoples with the diversity of individuals.
[00:31:00.382 --> 00:31:03.226]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:03.386 --> 00:31:06.390]  We're holding the Operation Money Bomb specials over till the end of the weekend.
[00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.573]  So log on now to InfoWars.com forward slash money bomb.
[00:31:10.094 --> 00:31:16.262]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:31:16.322 --> 00:31:18.885]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:31:18.985 --> 00:31:25.771]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:31:26.031 --> 00:31:28.893]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:31:29.033 --> 00:31:31.956]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:31:32.036 --> 00:31:33.978]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:31:33.998 --> 00:31:36.800]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:42.423]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:31:42.643 --> 00:31:46.125]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:31:46.145 --> 00:31:49.127]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:25.791]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:26.311 --> 00:33:31.152]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:31.172 --> 00:33:33.333]  I don't want to be in your London dungeon.
[00:33:33.553 --> 00:33:42.896]  I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... British hell.
[00:33:43.816 --> 00:33:45.037]  Ain't no mystery.
[00:33:47.157 --> 00:33:48.518]  Ain't no mystery.
[00:33:48.618 --> 00:33:49.438]  Why I'm in misery.
[00:33:54.053 --> 00:33:55.374]  You can't get enough of that voice.
[00:33:55.554 --> 00:34:01.016]  Sorry.
[00:34:04.258 --> 00:34:06.199]  Put us in there, pretty pins.
[00:34:06.839 --> 00:34:09.381]  Alright folks, good old British hell.
[00:34:10.121 --> 00:34:12.842]  That's what the New World Order is building worldwide.
[00:34:15.203 --> 00:34:16.664]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:34:16.704 --> 00:34:18.065]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:34:22.912 --> 00:34:31.134]  Now let me get back into the pedophile news, some of the other news, and I'm going to hit the Volkswagen news, which is just ultra-gigantic massive, which we already knew.
[00:34:31.934 --> 00:34:36.016]  But it's the very nature of the computerized, pre-programmed system.
[00:34:37.676 --> 00:34:44.238]  Under the new zeitgeist, we'll all live in giant dormitories, and the computer will decide our job and how much food we get.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.885]  And that's what the Megaopolis TV ads they show in the UK and videos for kids say.
[00:34:50.145 --> 00:34:54.690]  The computer will decide what you're gonna be and what you eat and where you go and how long you live.
[00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.553]  Yeah, but who programs the computer, Dum Dum?
[00:34:59.094 --> 00:35:01.697]  Well, it's gonna be... it's gonna be wonderful!
[00:35:02.478 --> 00:35:03.659]  It's gonna be great!
[00:35:06.238 --> 00:35:11.162]  So we're going to be looking into that, but first, I'm a pedophile, but not a monster.
[00:35:11.342 --> 00:35:13.784]  In fact, will you guys print me the Salon article itself?
[00:35:13.844 --> 00:35:16.186]  I want to read part of this on air later.
[00:35:17.487 --> 00:35:19.609]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:35:19.629 --> 00:35:19.989]  800-259-9231.
[00:35:20.029 --> 00:35:20.870]  Now, writing for Salon, Todd
[00:35:35.538 --> 00:35:36.898]  Nickerson says this.
[00:35:38.259 --> 00:35:40.100]  Isn't he brave coming out of the closet?
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.301]  Maybe he should be on the cover of Sports Illustrated.
[00:35:44.321 --> 00:35:46.302]  Maybe he should get an ESPN award.
[00:35:46.862 --> 00:35:49.703]  I'm a pedophile, but not a monster.
[00:35:51.223 --> 00:35:55.565]  I'm attracted to children, but unwilling to act on it.
[00:35:55.905 --> 00:35:56.125]  Uh-huh.
[00:35:57.125 --> 00:35:58.746]  Before judging me harshly,
[00:35:59.861 --> 00:36:01.583]  Would you be willing to listen?
[00:36:01.943 --> 00:36:10.632]  And this is exactly how the homosexual lobby started back in the 40s and 50s with articles in Reader's Digest saying the exact same thing.
[00:36:10.932 --> 00:36:14.676]  And then you can say, hey, that's adults, that's consenting, that's gone on forever.
[00:36:15.256 --> 00:36:15.997]  Absolutely.
[00:36:16.558 --> 00:36:20.522]  Homosexuals and pedophiles are two different categories totally.
[00:36:21.894 --> 00:36:29.179]  But once, the larger agenda, forget homosexuals, forget heterosexuals, forget any of these groups and labels.
[00:36:30.039 --> 00:36:47.450]  The larger globalist dehumanization, THX 1138, Brave New World, Brave New World Revisited, UNESCO Worldwide Treaty Arrangement Agreement, is to end sexuality as we know it, and make us asexual bots.
[00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:50.832]  If they choose to even keep humanoids around,
[00:36:52.264 --> 00:36:54.065]  This debate was being held back in the 30s.
[00:36:58.748 --> 00:37:03.472]  So there's an attack on femininity, there's an attack on masculinity, there's an attack on the species.
[00:37:03.492 --> 00:37:07.735]  And there's a revolution of women, I've noticed, waking up to this more than even men.
[00:37:07.755 --> 00:37:15.040]  And there's a major trying to get back to the true nature of humanity and how empowering it is.
[00:37:16.124 --> 00:37:22.248]  Not the twisted roles that certainly were there under classical male masculinity, feminine femininity.
[00:37:24.229 --> 00:37:25.850]  The god, the goddess, the archetypes.
[00:37:29.713 --> 00:37:32.835]  But the people that crave power, crave control.
[00:37:33.936 --> 00:37:43.622]  The Sanduskies that get control of major departments and then are protected by the school and rape children in broad daylight in the middle of the field house in the showers.
[00:37:46.164 --> 00:37:52.692]  A field house at a major university during the day, seven days a week, is like an anthill.
[00:37:55.256 --> 00:38:02.305]  And now it's come out there were cover-ups and that Sandusky Foundation was supplying children statewide.
[00:38:06.087 --> 00:38:07.308]  But see, it's too big to fail.
[00:38:07.989 --> 00:38:14.574]  Because if that ever comes out, the whole university goes down, and the billions that have been invested in it, and the alumni, just like the Vatican.
[00:38:14.774 --> 00:38:29.227]  And that's why the globalist will place a pedophile cult in Congress, in a State House, in a school, in a university, in a religious institution, and within two generations,
[00:38:30.546 --> 00:38:32.727]  I don't mean fully living out their lives of being born.
[00:38:33.027 --> 00:38:36.768]  Within 40 years on average, they have an equation for it.
[00:38:37.648 --> 00:38:39.329]  It will take over the institution.
[00:38:40.129 --> 00:38:43.270]  Because something that horrible must be covered up.
[00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:46.951]  Something that horrible must not be spoken about.
[00:38:48.892 --> 00:38:50.132]  So they set the precedent.
[00:38:51.121 --> 00:38:55.923]  They break up the family, they send women to work, and I'm not saying in all cases that women shouldn't work.
[00:38:55.943 --> 00:38:59.505]  If a woman wants to work, a woman's a brain surgeon, a scientist, a rocket scientist.
[00:38:59.625 --> 00:39:01.285]  Sure, women have always been doing that.
[00:39:01.365 --> 00:39:07.988]  But to force women into the roles that they weren't biologically designed in, again, is on record to enslave women.
[00:39:09.269 --> 00:39:16.072]  And to force the sexualization of children, to say, Heather has two mommies, and Stevie has two daddies,
[00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:25.680]  All of this is the school deciding to have sexual discussions with your children that you haven't even decided to have.
[00:39:27.142 --> 00:39:28.523]  If somebody walked up to your children...
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:55.479]  At the park, while you were off getting, say, tennis rackets out of the car, if a woman walked over, a man walked over, to say, your two daughters, ages 7 and 9, or 5 and 6, and said, little girls, let me tell you about oral sex, let me tell you about how to masturbate, you would be arrested for contributing to the delinquency of minors, and attempting a sexual act with a child, you'd spend five years in jail, in most states.
[00:39:57.176 --> 00:40:01.943]  Now if I caught you doing it, you'd probably spend the rest of your life in a coma if you were lucky.
[00:40:04.266 --> 00:40:05.028]  And that's not talk.
[00:40:05.128 --> 00:40:07.591]  It's really easy to beat somebody's brains out when you want to.
[00:40:08.012 --> 00:40:09.013]  You just decide to do it.
[00:40:09.534 --> 00:40:10.435]  Humans have a governor.
[00:40:11.391 --> 00:40:13.372]  You get in a fight with me, I don't have a governor.
[00:40:13.672 --> 00:40:17.213]  If you're hurting me, or hurting my children, I will decide to hurt you.
[00:40:17.233 --> 00:40:22.334]  I will will it, I will punch you in the throat, and then you can drown on your own blood.
[00:40:22.975 --> 00:40:24.495]  And people say that sounds evil and hateful.
[00:40:24.695 --> 00:40:25.315]  No it doesn't!
[00:40:25.596 --> 00:40:28.456]  It's the right spirit against this type of garbage.
[00:40:28.657 --> 00:40:31.717]  You keep your filthy hands off our kids, you perverts!
[00:40:32.098 --> 00:40:35.779]  And that goes for those medical perverts that want to inject them with all these deadly vaccines.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:40.083]  Hell, you've already gone from 1 in 25,000 having autism to 1 in 58.
[00:40:40.824 --> 00:40:42.946]  Aren't you proud enough of what you've already done?
[00:40:42.966 --> 00:40:47.511]  Keep your dirty, filthy hands out of our families, you scum!
[00:40:47.811 --> 00:40:48.792]  You control freaks!
[00:40:49.112 --> 00:40:51.495]  Normal people don't want to run other people's lives.
[00:40:51.855 --> 00:40:53.777]  Normal people have their own world.
[00:40:54.037 --> 00:40:57.601]  Normal people are so successful and happy, they got too many friends.
[00:40:58.261 --> 00:41:00.604]  You people are a bunch of trash!
[00:41:04.525 --> 00:41:05.466]  I'm a pedophile!
[00:41:05.826 --> 00:41:07.287]  Now, the New York Times will take that out of context.
[00:41:07.387 --> 00:41:08.148]  I am not a pedophile.
[00:41:08.188 --> 00:41:10.210]  I'm quoting the White House Connected Group.
[00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.671]  So long.
[00:41:12.271 --> 00:41:13.532]  And again, this is their next move.
[00:41:13.552 --> 00:41:26.563]  And I kept saying, they've now gotten sexualization of children, they now are putting the transgender bathrooms in to totally turn school into a sexual conversion center over to the new system.
[00:41:27.624 --> 00:41:29.825]  So now I said the pedophilia will be rolled out.
[00:41:30.166 --> 00:41:33.849]  I said it last week in three different reports, one of them at Facebook Mentions.
[00:41:35.623 --> 00:41:39.086]  I'm a pedophile, he writes, but not a monster.
[00:41:40.308 --> 00:41:42.450]  I'm attracted to children but unwilling to act on it.
[00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:47.435]  Before judging me harshly, you should be willing, would you be willing to listen?
[00:41:48.696 --> 00:41:51.098]  And now you get to hear all about it.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:57.024]  Yet you're attracted to children because you never got sexually developed properly.
[00:41:58.422 --> 00:42:02.865]  You're attracted to children because you're a sick freak who wants to feed off their energy.
[00:42:03.305 --> 00:42:06.927]  You should be attracted to help children and build them up and nurture them.
[00:42:07.247 --> 00:42:12.350]  You should be attracted to defending them, like I'm attracted to wanting to get my hands around your throat.
[00:42:13.831 --> 00:42:15.372]  I'm attracted to you now, do you understand that?
[00:42:15.552 --> 00:42:22.175]  But not the way you... Just imagine, blow, out the jaw, jaw break!
[00:42:23.276 --> 00:42:24.797]  Watch that evil fall to the ground!
[00:42:28.305 --> 00:42:30.026]  Excuse me, I shouldn't even be on here today reading this.
[00:42:30.146 --> 00:42:31.527]  I just, I saw this last night.
[00:42:32.187 --> 00:42:36.069]  And I already knew it was all coming, but oh, now we're gonna be pedophobes.
[00:42:36.289 --> 00:42:38.250]  I mean, just, you know, pedophile phobes.
[00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:41.292]  Oh, God help us.
[00:42:41.632 --> 00:42:42.593]  They're never gonna stop.
[00:42:42.633 --> 00:42:46.775]  They're such, they're gonna put drugs in the food and water more intense when we barely can resist.
[00:42:46.855 --> 00:42:47.796]  I mean, it's just so evil.
[00:42:48.985 --> 00:43:01.476]  Everybody's gonna be dying of cancer all around us just with potbelly pedophiles hopping around like it's a Super Mario Brothers, you know, grabbing our children, giggling, bouncing onto the necks with SWAT teams defending them as they just pick which kids they want.
[00:43:02.136 --> 00:43:05.239]  And as giant third world hordes just pour in, raping everyone.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:19.011]  Just sexualizing our children, ruling everything, debasing the currency, drugging the food and water, giving everyone cancer, and just dancing to their god of death, selling body parts, chopping up babies that battle the scalpel.
[00:43:19.411 --> 00:43:20.912]  I mean, it's just on.
[00:43:20.993 --> 00:43:23.615]  Hell on earth, the gates are opening!
[00:43:24.115 --> 00:43:25.777]  And out will flood the armies!
[00:43:34.494 --> 00:43:36.215]  Out will flood the armies of hell.
[00:43:39.657 --> 00:43:42.939]  And no film can even imagine their true depths of depravity.
[00:43:47.022 --> 00:43:48.583]  Because it goes beyond the pedophilia.
[00:43:50.884 --> 00:43:52.525]  It goes down to child sacrifice.
[00:43:52.665 --> 00:44:02.431]  Every culture in its decline ends up sacrificing children, ends up debasing, because the gods of death, the god of this world, wants the flesh of children.
[00:44:04.386 --> 00:44:16.219]  And if they can't get away with torturing your child in a subterranean pit for two months and sucking their soul out as they beg for mommy, they'll rape them instead and no one will protect your children once they get in full control.
[00:44:18.001 --> 00:44:20.704]  And they send out their useful idiot minions.
[00:44:25.779 --> 00:44:27.460]  They sell why they're different.
[00:44:28.361 --> 00:44:29.942]  Oh, it's just my proclivity.
[00:44:30.162 --> 00:44:31.984]  It's just what I'm into, they say.
[00:44:32.384 --> 00:44:33.345]  I'm attracted to children.
[00:44:33.465 --> 00:44:34.245]  Accept me.
[00:44:35.106 --> 00:44:35.746]  Be liberal.
[00:44:35.867 --> 00:44:37.828]  And then it's gonna be, now you must adopt it.
[00:44:38.368 --> 00:44:41.911]  Now you must give your children to us, they say.
[00:44:41.931 --> 00:44:49.657]  Then it'll be, we need pedophiles in the military.
[00:44:51.257 --> 00:44:51.617]  Watch!
[00:44:51.677 --> 00:44:52.298]  I'm not kidding.
[00:44:52.338 --> 00:44:53.419]  I'm not being sardonic.
[00:44:53.479 --> 00:44:54.980]  I'm not being sarcastic.
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:58.863]  I'm not engaged in literary satire here.
[00:44:58.924 --> 00:44:59.724]  This is real.
[00:45:00.545 --> 00:45:01.806]  The New World Order is real.
[00:45:02.206 --> 00:45:03.267]  It's plan is real.
[00:45:03.888 --> 00:45:08.472]  It's people that desire to do things that are destructive because it's their cult.
[00:45:08.572 --> 00:45:09.533]  It's their sacrament.
[00:45:09.813 --> 00:45:10.814]  It's their religion.
[00:45:13.456 --> 00:45:15.397]  I want to go to phone calls and then I will...
[00:45:19.744 --> 00:45:22.485]  At the start of the hour, get into the Volkswagen scandal widens.
[00:45:24.226 --> 00:45:29.249]  I saw this story a few days ago and didn't even really mention it because so much stuff I already know.
[00:45:30.509 --> 00:45:34.892]  So, I have a blind spot right of seeing, oh, of course, and then later I think, that's really big.
[00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:36.913]  That'll illustrate things to the sheeple.
[00:45:38.133 --> 00:45:45.657]  And hopefully we can talk about it and get our listeners to go out and wake up some more sheeple.
[00:45:45.677 --> 00:45:46.618]  11 million cars
[00:45:47.782 --> 00:45:56.527]  have a computer algorithm that knows when the car is up on the blocks being tested and knows when the computer handshakes with it.
[00:45:59.809 --> 00:46:02.330]  And at that point, it then fakes the emissions.
[00:46:04.972 --> 00:46:09.074]  And that's the nature of your smartphone, the nature of your smart meters.
[00:46:09.534 --> 00:46:15.538]  I mean, I remember Enron was bragging in the late 90s where they got caught in all their other criminal operations because they went too far.
[00:46:15.578 --> 00:46:16.358]  They always go too far.
[00:46:16.378 --> 00:46:17.019]  They're not invincible.
[00:46:18.189 --> 00:46:27.754]  With Al Gore involved, they said, we're going to have computers and everything, and we're going to tax you more when you use your power, and we're even going to control your thermostat.
[00:46:28.094 --> 00:46:33.597]  And so we warned people about it, and they had San Francisco Chronicle articles and New York Times articles saying, we were insane.
[00:46:34.118 --> 00:46:41.361]  There was no plan to control and charge you more at peak times with smart meters or to turn your power on and off or reduce it.
[00:46:41.562 --> 00:46:44.063]  And of course, it's now all being announced, all being done.
[00:46:45.046 --> 00:46:47.308]  They told you it'd be another 20 years until driverless cars.
[00:46:47.488 --> 00:46:48.970]  They're now launching all over the country.
[00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:50.091]  Totally gamed.
[00:46:50.111 --> 00:46:51.272]  They're going to get half the roads.
[00:46:51.492 --> 00:46:53.134]  You're going to pay for it and subsidize it.
[00:46:53.394 --> 00:46:54.775]  They're going to totally screw you over.
[00:46:55.556 --> 00:46:58.239]  Rahm Emanuel's brother basically is going to run the whole franchise.
[00:46:58.539 --> 00:46:59.540]  And that's just the way it is.
[00:47:00.161 --> 00:47:00.881]  Because we lay down.
[00:47:01.922 --> 00:47:02.783]  It's called smart.
[00:47:03.224 --> 00:47:03.764]  It's cute.
[00:47:03.784 --> 00:47:04.205]  It's funny.
[00:47:06.425 --> 00:47:09.507]  And they're going to raise your insurance until you can't afford to drive your regular car.
[00:47:09.567 --> 00:47:10.528]  It's all about control.
[00:47:11.449 --> 00:47:19.355]  All the major German manufacturers, the Japanese manufacturers are coming out saying, yes, we will have smart systems with cameras watching everything you do.
[00:47:19.695 --> 00:47:28.362]  And if you look upset or too tired or your kids, it's too hot in the car or whatever, it will then activate the police, the threat fusion center and start sending everything to the police.
[00:47:29.102 --> 00:47:32.345]  This is announced seven years ago by Toyota.
[00:47:35.399 --> 00:47:42.185]  And you pay for all this tech being put in your car, and then it games everything you do where you go.
[00:47:42.585 --> 00:47:51.712]  I mean, 70 years ago, folks, Ford and Chevy had carburetors that went 100 miles to the gallon and gave you 300 horsepower.
[00:47:55.655 --> 00:48:01.100]  They stifle real innovation and then give us scam junk in the name of innovation.
[00:48:02.776 --> 00:48:04.057]  Because we're such innovators.
[00:48:04.297 --> 00:48:11.424]  We're about to innovate away from the elite with incredible singularity of manufacturing, medicine, technology, and then humans.
[00:48:11.484 --> 00:48:12.706]  And here's, I'm about to give it to you right now.
[00:48:12.726 --> 00:48:13.526]  This is the big secret.
[00:48:13.907 --> 00:48:16.609]  Humans will blossom and spread to the stars.
[00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:19.072]  It is going to be spectacular.
[00:48:19.232 --> 00:48:25.718]  I mean, I can feel the race consciousness of humanity ready to master build, ready to go to the next level.
[00:48:25.798 --> 00:48:27.220]  I mean, it is awesome.
[00:48:28.371 --> 00:48:29.771]  Our ancestors are behind us.
[00:48:29.932 --> 00:48:30.832]  We're currently here.
[00:48:30.852 --> 00:48:39.254]  I can feel the progeny of the future ready as this earth, through God, gives birth to just an incredible new time.
[00:48:39.554 --> 00:48:51.358]  And the elite are doing everything they can to stifle it, make it dirty, make it bad, teach us to hate ourselves, mutate and wreck everything so only they can control genetic technology, nanotech,
[00:48:51.638 --> 00:48:54.721]  That's the ultimate goal of the New World Order.
[00:48:54.741 --> 00:48:57.084]  I mean, I think space exploration should just be all out
[00:49:11.318 --> 00:49:24.043]  Anything goes, boom, you decide which group you're going to join, and then ultimate freedom once you've decided which group you want to join, which direction you want to go, and then those groups are going to split off as well into the ultimate competition.
[00:49:24.163 --> 00:49:26.464]  It's going to be fantastic.
[00:49:28.205 --> 00:49:31.466]  And I can feel the spirit of Liberty Rising
[00:49:32.708 --> 00:49:49.475]  The spirit of justice rising, the spirit of birth rising, the spirit of creativity, the spirit of creation, the spirit of prosperity, the spirit of God, and this devil and it's time to sit here and stomp on humanity and
[00:49:50.155 --> 00:49:55.660]  And urinate all over us and tear us into pieces and have simulated victories over humanity?
[00:49:56.061 --> 00:49:58.523]  You've had simulated victories over humanity.
[00:49:58.803 --> 00:49:59.704]  You have failed.
[00:50:00.025 --> 00:50:01.026]  You are fallen.
[00:50:01.326 --> 00:50:05.730]  You are only here to strengthen us at this moment and test us to go to the next level.
[00:50:06.831 --> 00:50:12.637]  And so, the devil is fulfilling his office that we be tested in free will.
[00:50:13.697 --> 00:50:21.101]  But you will not be told any of this in the churches, you will not be told any of this in the schools, you will not be told any of this because they don't want you to know.
[00:50:22.161 --> 00:50:23.262]  They live, we sleep.
[00:50:23.762 --> 00:50:24.603]  Well, not anymore.
[00:50:24.623 --> 00:50:33.127]  We're going to go to break and come back with John, Steve, Gordon, Augusta, Ben and others that are patiently holding today.
[00:50:35.048 --> 00:50:37.990]  And then we'll get into more on the Volkswagen situation and more.
[00:50:40.014 --> 00:50:45.396]  This is what these companies do, and you go to a globalist confab of the Fortune 100, Volkswagen's one of the main groups.
[00:50:46.136 --> 00:50:51.458]  And none of them follow their own rules, none of them follow their own systems, because that's for us, not for them.
[00:50:53.198 --> 00:50:56.620]  And it's all a giant fraud, but also it's more beautiful than that.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:02.622]  Even the people in the system want a faster, better car, and no, carbon is helping the earth, not hurting it.
[00:51:03.022 --> 00:51:06.143]  And so, they're only playing along with it.
[00:51:06.163 --> 00:51:07.643]  Innovation can't be stopped!

[00:53:08.849 --> 00:53:13.091]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[00:53:13.271 --> 00:53:17.173]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[00:53:17.333 --> 00:53:24.517]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s, and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[00:53:24.697 --> 00:53:29.720]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?

[00:54:18.813 --> 00:54:31.624]  Well, a judge, looking at the clock kid story, says if it can be proven that it was done as a hoax to create alarm and fear, it's basically a bomb threat.
[00:54:33.286 --> 00:54:34.547]  I mean, how obvious is it?
[00:54:36.696 --> 00:54:39.259]  Just another White House stunt blowing up in their face.
[00:54:39.779 --> 00:54:46.627]  British general threatens military coup if socialists gain control of Parliament.
[00:54:48.228 --> 00:54:51.572]  Turkey responsible for flood of illegal immigrants into Europe, it's now admitted.
[00:54:53.013 --> 00:54:57.818]  Caught on video, black teen punches racist bus driver in the face for demanding a fare.
[00:54:58.885 --> 00:54:59.405]  That's right.
[00:54:59.485 --> 00:55:01.666]  Oh, you gave a ruling we didn't like?
[00:55:01.706 --> 00:55:02.687]  A call we didn't like in football?
[00:55:02.707 --> 00:55:03.307]  We're going to attack you.
[00:55:03.327 --> 00:55:03.827]  You're racist.
[00:55:04.468 --> 00:55:05.768]  Oh, you want me to pay to ride the bus?
[00:55:05.788 --> 00:55:06.389]  I'm going to attack you.
[00:55:06.409 --> 00:55:06.889]  You're racist.
[00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:09.370]  Another report.
[00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:12.552]  German media covering up rapes committed by Muslim migrants.
[00:55:14.673 --> 00:55:15.453]  No salon.
[00:55:15.613 --> 00:55:18.275]  I don't need to understand the plight of pedophiles.
[00:55:21.376 --> 00:55:25.138]  You see, that's the thing, is the pedophiles pushing that we should feel sorry for them.
[00:55:25.458 --> 00:55:26.699]  Pushing that we should like them.
[00:55:27.878 --> 00:55:30.019]  And then they won't prosecute real pedophiles.
[00:55:30.519 --> 00:55:33.520]  They'll just plant stuff on Pentagon computers and blackmail everybody.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:38.422]  Or they'll go after some 18-year-old guy who's dating his sweetheart who's 16 or vice versa.
[00:55:39.282 --> 00:55:41.083]  Oh, the courts love statutory rape.
[00:55:46.205 --> 00:55:48.446]  And these NAMBLA people want to go after 5-year-olds.
[00:55:50.768 --> 00:55:55.371]  So that's all coming up, and I'm going to get into Putin deploys now 28 combat planes.
[00:55:55.431 --> 00:55:56.692]  It was four to Syria.
[00:55:57.052 --> 00:55:58.893]  We've known for years there's Russian troops.
[00:56:00.535 --> 00:56:03.196]  Now the news is like, OK, the Russians are really there.
[00:56:03.256 --> 00:56:05.238]  I mean, you read foreign news, it's all admitted.
[00:56:06.819 --> 00:56:14.424]  You read our news, it's like crazy, because they don't even want you to know that Putin keeps saying for three years, join me in fighting al-Qaeda, join me in fighting ISIS.
[00:56:15.848 --> 00:56:17.890]  They won't even say it in our news.
[00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:21.592]  That's how ignorant the people are because of the media to a great extent.
[00:56:23.614 --> 00:56:28.798]  Or now the media is like, yeah, Putin snuck in, he invaded Syria like he invaded Ukraine.
[00:56:29.218 --> 00:56:30.859]  Oh my gosh, we got to do something.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:32.661]  This is a huge provocation.
[00:56:33.695 --> 00:56:46.387]  When Putin's been on the world stage for at least three years saying, okay, he'll give up his chemical weapons, he'll work with you, we'll elect a new government, please bring in UN troops with US troops, let's work together, let's kick the radical jihadis out, Russia is ready for a joint deal.
[00:56:48.569 --> 00:56:49.370]  And they go, no!
[00:56:50.919 --> 00:56:53.140]  And launch a chemical attack and blame it on Assad and Putin.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:57:00.443]  I mean, I read newspapers and it's just like every day there's an editorial with an editorial cartoon where Putin is giving chemical weapons to Assad.
[00:57:00.483 --> 00:57:01.384]  It's just all made up.
[00:57:01.624 --> 00:57:03.765]  It's admitted Al-Qaeda launched those attacks.
[00:57:10.047 --> 00:57:13.389]  And I hope the Russian troops absolutely defeat the Saudi Arabian terrorists.
[00:57:16.707 --> 00:57:18.949]  And it's not that I, again, lionize Russia.
[00:57:18.989 --> 00:57:22.672]  Russia's got its own problems, but Russia is under attack by these people.
[00:57:23.813 --> 00:57:25.354]  Syria's right by the Russian border.
[00:57:25.634 --> 00:57:31.539]  Russia understands what it's facing, and it's fighting back against a real radical jihad threat that's run by our criminal government.
[00:57:31.719 --> 00:57:33.841]  We're going to go to break, and I promise to come back to your calls.
[00:57:33.861 --> 00:57:34.742]  This is a short segment.
[00:57:35.723 --> 00:57:37.224]  I want to thank you all for your support.

[00:57:56.699 --> 00:57:58.901]  A true game changer for myself and my family.
[00:57:59.621 --> 00:58:00.862]  We don't try to make this sell out.
[00:58:00.882 --> 00:58:02.684]  We thought we had enough, but it's so popular.
[00:58:02.704 --> 00:58:06.227]  It may be over a month once it sells out that we're out of it.
[00:58:06.247 --> 00:58:10.030]  So if you want to stock up on Survival Shield X2, the Deep Earth Crystal based source,
[00:58:10.942 --> 00:58:13.383]  It's available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:58:14.144 --> 00:58:17.986]  We have sold out of the Liver Cleanze and of the Deep Cleanze.
[00:58:18.026 --> 00:58:19.567]  It'll be months until that comes back in.
[00:58:20.047 --> 00:58:28.252]  Knockout, the amazing Sleep Aid, Valerian Root, Gamba, Melatonin, Chamomile Flower Extract, L-Tryptophan, and many other compounds.

[00:58:35.152 --> 00:58:36.873]  It's the equivalent price of a bottle of melatonin.
[00:58:36.893 --> 00:58:38.434]  It has the standard dose of melatonin in it.
[00:58:39.315 --> 00:58:39.655]  That would be $19.95.
[00:58:40.416 --> 00:58:41.777]  With all the other ingredients, it's $19.95.

[00:58:59.958 --> 00:59:03.763]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[00:59:04.043 --> 00:59:14.375]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[00:59:14.515 --> 00:59:17.439]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[00:59:17.619 --> 00:59:26.564]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:59:26.724 --> 00:59:28.125]  This is the good halogen.
[00:59:28.225 --> 00:59:30.987]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[00:59:31.307 --> 00:59:43.074]  Now we at InfoWarsLife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure, 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.

[01:00:22.375 --> 01:00:23.275]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.915 --> 01:00:27.516]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.116 --> 01:00:32.217]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.517 --> 01:00:34.658]  We got the ladies joining us.
[01:00:34.698 --> 01:00:36.678]  You've had the viral video for just two segments.
[01:00:36.698 --> 01:00:37.718]  Then we'll go back to your calls.
[01:00:37.738 --> 01:00:38.999]  I'm not going to call us right now.
[01:00:39.459 --> 01:00:41.239]  Diamond and Silk join us in the next segment.
[01:00:42.479 --> 01:00:44.240]  Well, we just joined as Salon came out.
[01:00:45.182 --> 01:00:45.622]  Yeah, hello?
[01:00:45.682 --> 01:00:46.443]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:00:46.463 --> 01:00:49.525]  I'm a big supporter and started to listen to you last year during the
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:15.980]  The riots in Missouri.
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:32.605]  I just wanted to touch up on the subject that you're on right now and it's crazy because I'm from Miami and you see that going on a lot here because these Hispanic cultures, they kind of do that regularly in some Hispanic nations.
[01:01:32.645 --> 01:01:41.447]  That's normal for an older man to go with a younger woman, you know, and really young and it's odd and it's awkward and it's just really
[01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:47.114]  Well, you're going to get arrested in the future if you don't hand your 10-year-old daughter over to people.
[01:01:47.154 --> 01:01:47.934]  And look, any old world culture
[01:02:02.734 --> 01:02:09.596]  Women started getting married at 13, 14, 15, because technically you can say that they're a woman at that point.
[01:02:10.076 --> 01:02:14.777]  Western culture, we started arresting development, decided to push it back to, you know, 18 or whatever.
[01:02:15.517 --> 01:02:22.099]  I personally think 16 is probably the proper age, just looking at history, looking at different countries.
[01:02:22.199 --> 01:02:27.640]  But separately, as a 40-something-year-old man, I'm not even attracted to 20-year-old women now.
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:28.621]  I don't know.
[01:02:49.477 --> 01:02:58.304]  A little aberrant, I say a little, it's very aberrant, but it's a small group that does it where, yeah, 14, 15-year-old girls are, you know, with 50, 60-year-old guys.
[01:02:59.565 --> 01:03:07.851]  And yes, there is a big problem with Central and South Americans particularly raping young girls because they just think that's normal.
[01:03:08.332 --> 01:03:09.893]  And that's being covered up, that's going on.
[01:03:09.973 --> 01:03:10.894]  Same thing in the Middle East.
[01:03:11.434 --> 01:03:14.737]  That's why they cover women up in the Middle East is culturally.
[01:03:14.797 --> 01:03:19.060]  I mean, look, if you're really good looking and you go to areas of Italy, a woman, guys are whistling at you.
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:21.282]  Now, if you're with a guy, they don't even look at you.
[01:03:22.363 --> 01:03:23.463]  It's the same thing in Greece.
[01:03:23.844 --> 01:03:27.467]  If a woman just goes out dressed like a slut, guys are going to come after her.
[01:03:27.887 --> 01:03:30.189]  That's where you kind of get the idea of women shouldn't dress like that.
[01:03:30.269 --> 01:03:30.969]  I'm not saying that.
[01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:32.731]  Women have a right to dress however they want.
[01:03:33.671 --> 01:03:35.772]  Uh, but it's a very complex issue.
[01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:38.593]  What Nambla wants is to go after five-year-olds.
[01:03:39.193 --> 01:03:40.913]  And there's no debating that's sick.
[01:03:40.973 --> 01:03:42.374]  There's no debating that's evil.
[01:03:43.494 --> 01:03:46.555]  Because the children can't make their own decision.
[01:03:46.595 --> 01:03:47.475]  They're not developed.
[01:03:47.555 --> 01:03:48.655]  It traumatizes them.
[01:03:49.015 --> 01:03:50.416]  And you've got these sick freaks.
[01:03:51.704 --> 01:03:56.148]  That want to have the power over children, and that's what pedophilia is all about.
[01:03:56.829 --> 01:04:06.498]  And all I need to say is, anybody touches my daughters, my son's older now, he's 13, but anybody hurts my kids, you're not going to have to wait for the police department to come.
[01:04:06.818 --> 01:04:09.540]  I mean, it's just a guarantee that I'm going to defend my family.
[01:04:10.141 --> 01:04:13.564]  And we need to get that attitude again that you keep your stinking hands off our kids.
[01:04:13.824 --> 01:04:15.286]  Closing comment from you, Adam.
[01:04:16.772 --> 01:04:24.577]  No, I just want to say that I 100% agree with you and I'll punch somebody in the throat too if they mess with my niece or nephew also.
[01:04:24.657 --> 01:04:26.038]  So have a great day, Alex.
[01:04:26.318 --> 01:04:26.858]  God bless you.
[01:04:26.878 --> 01:04:28.359]  And I don't get up here to act tough and stuff.
[01:04:28.419 --> 01:04:35.004]  I mean, I literally start getting craved when I think about, you've seen these pedophiles on the news.
[01:04:35.064 --> 01:04:36.685]  I've seen NAMBLA meetings on TV.
[01:04:37.725 --> 01:04:39.847]  I've seen the photos of the UN meetings with them.
[01:04:39.887 --> 01:04:41.007]  I mean, they all look the same.
[01:04:41.047 --> 01:04:43.189]  It's like these little demonic chubby fat guys.
[01:04:45.631 --> 01:04:54.918]  Like, Tyrannosaurus Rex have their hands right in front of their chest, and they just sit there smiling with their tongues flicking out like snakes going, we want your kids, we want your kids, we want your kids.
[01:04:55.238 --> 01:05:00.181]  And just every instinct in me, if there was like a rattlesnake species that came after kids, I'd want to kill it.
[01:05:00.862 --> 01:05:03.724]  Or, you know, I mean, it's just these people hunt our children.
[01:05:04.084 --> 01:05:05.045]  Where are our instincts?
[01:05:05.805 --> 01:05:06.566]  Where are our instincts?
[01:05:09.907 --> 01:05:12.608]  Over the weekend, Cheryl Atkinson released the following article.
[01:05:12.768 --> 01:05:15.730]  What the news isn't saying about vaccine autism studies.
[01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:21.152]  She starts off with the New England Journal of Medicine study that says there is no link between vaccines and autism.
[01:05:21.372 --> 01:05:26.595]  She then discloses the consulting firm behind the study, the Lewin Group, lists major vaccine makers among its clients.
[01:05:26.775 --> 01:05:31.157]  In fact, the Lewin Group's parent company, United Health Group, is a key government partner in Obamacare.
[01:05:31.317 --> 01:05:36.299]  And a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, QSSI, was given the contract to build the Obamacare website.
[01:05:36.439 --> 01:05:49.965]  She then looks at the AstroTurf propaganda campaign and some of the buzzwords they use, like weak, too small, haphazard, not replicated, junk science, flawed, unrelated, and how these words are used over and over again to attack anybody who questions the vaccine mafia.
[01:05:50.105 --> 01:05:55.308]  She then covers over 13 different studies that show a correlation between vaccine intake and brain damage.
[01:05:55.528 --> 01:06:00.930]  In fact, permanent brain damage is an acknowledged rare side effect of vaccines, and there's no dispute in that arena.
[01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:06.277]  So the next time your herd mentality friends are pushing vaccine propaganda in your face, shove this back in theirs.
[01:06:06.478 --> 01:06:09.242]  Rob Dew for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:06:09.742 --> 01:06:16.652]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.
[01:06:16.892 --> 01:06:17.333]  We're good.

[01:07:10.819 --> 01:07:14.422]  The Globalists have launched a planetary destabilization plan.
[01:07:14.643 --> 01:07:18.266]  Here at the InfoWars operation, we hope and pray that this is not the case.
[01:07:18.526 --> 01:07:22.389]  But the signs of things deteriorating around the world are unmistakable.
[01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:29.135]  For many years, I've been working with my Patriot Supply, and we have now developed a private label called InfoWars Select.
[01:07:29.315 --> 01:07:34.058]  Look, it's important to have firearms and water filtration during a collapse, but you've also gotta have food.

[01:08:12.358 --> 01:08:14.541]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:14.561 --> 01:08:17.926]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:33.618 --> 01:08:49.084]  Hey y'all okay so it's a day after the base and y'all know I am mad as hell okay and I would be pissed off okay but see somebody done already tried to come for Donald so I got to come for them all right okay now now last night on the base Fox
[01:08:49.844 --> 01:08:50.085]  Yes.
[01:08:50.105 --> 01:08:50.165]  Yes.
[01:09:07.049 --> 01:09:13.050]  And then only Rosie O'Donnell Trump interrupted, and then, you know, the audience started cheering, okay?
[01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:18.652]  For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O'Donnell, Kelly reported, before finishing her question.
[01:09:18.952 --> 01:09:26.114]  Here's the damn deal, Megyn Kelly, or Kelly, Megyn, whatever your name is, Rosie O'Donnell started that whole foolishness.
[01:09:26.154 --> 01:09:31.075]  She was on a view, and she the one that spoke out against Donald, and Donald had to come back on her.
[01:09:31.095 --> 01:09:35.956]  So I don't know why you gonna make this here a part of your forum last night.
[01:09:36.516 --> 01:09:39.038]  Well, perhaps you don't need to be hosting debates.
[01:09:39.199 --> 01:09:43.162]  Perhaps what she needs to do, maybe it's time for us to file Kelly.
[01:09:43.322 --> 01:09:44.784]  Alright, we're going to fade it down.
[01:09:44.844 --> 01:09:45.685]  It's a famous rant.
[01:09:45.945 --> 01:09:47.566]  Millions and millions of views online.
[01:09:47.646 --> 01:09:54.072]  Diamond and Silk are sisters from North Carolina and they stand with the silent majority.
[01:09:55.271 --> 01:09:59.352]  And they are voicing their opinion at DiamondAndSilk.com.
[01:09:59.672 --> 01:10:01.773]  And that whole Megyn Kelly thing, absolutely.
[01:10:02.333 --> 01:10:08.955]  The reason we're bringing them on now is to get their take a month or so more into the election, what they think of Donald Trump, where they think the election's going.
[01:10:09.615 --> 01:10:11.255]  The race is starting to narrow.
[01:10:11.575 --> 01:10:16.997]  They took Megyn Kelly off for a few weeks to try to end that whole controversy because she was losing that controversy.
[01:10:17.537 --> 01:10:20.658]  But this idea that if a man criticizes a man, that's okay.
[01:10:21.158 --> 01:10:24.159]  But if a man criticizes a woman, he's attacking all women.
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:29.642]  And I think as part of equality, women should be able to say whatever they want about men, men should be able to say whatever.
[01:10:29.662 --> 01:10:36.085]  I mean, within reason, but they're trying to change the whole debate into a feminist versus male situation.
[01:10:36.145 --> 01:10:46.009]  I wanted to get Diamond and Silk's take, joining us via video Skype, on what they think in the last month since this controversy has now morphed into other controversies.
[01:10:46.209 --> 01:10:47.250]  Thank you for joining us, ladies.
[01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:49.191]  Thank you for having us.
[01:10:50.162 --> 01:10:52.123]  Well, I'm the one up here ranting.
[01:10:52.183 --> 01:10:53.064]  I want to hear from you.
[01:10:53.404 --> 01:10:54.885]  What do you think about Donald Trump now?
[01:10:54.945 --> 01:10:56.145]  You still love him as much as you did?
[01:10:56.746 --> 01:10:57.606]  Yes, we do.
[01:10:57.626 --> 01:11:02.469]  As a matter of fact, we just changed to Republicans, so we will be voting for him in the primaries.
[01:11:02.769 --> 01:11:10.254]  And we ask everybody, if the establishment and the GOP don't want to get behind Donald Trump, then we, the American people, have to get behind him.
[01:11:10.534 --> 01:11:14.056]  So if you are a Democrat, go switch your party to Republican today.
[01:11:14.276 --> 01:11:14.736]  Today?
[01:11:14.756 --> 01:11:16.737]  Yeah, so that you can vote for him in the primaries.
[01:11:16.777 --> 01:11:17.378]  That's right.
[01:11:17.778 --> 01:11:19.339]  What got you guys into Donald Trump?
[01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:22.533]  Because he's speaking the American people language.
[01:11:22.833 --> 01:11:34.045]  He's talking about keeping American people safe by securing our borders, bringing our jobs back where people can thrive again in this country, and making this country great again where we're united instead of divided.
[01:11:34.065 --> 01:11:34.626]  That's right.
[01:11:35.489 --> 01:11:38.530]  Well, it certainly is a positive message he puts out.
[01:11:39.230 --> 01:11:42.091]  I just hope that he's completely sincere.
[01:11:42.111 --> 01:11:43.172]  Do you ever worry about him?
[01:11:43.192 --> 01:11:44.852]  Because I didn't get you on to put doubts in your mind.
[01:11:44.892 --> 01:11:46.273]  I'm actually liking him more and more.
[01:11:47.053 --> 01:11:50.454]  But when he used to say he liked Hillary and stuff, do you think that was just him being friendly?
[01:11:51.519 --> 01:11:58.305]  He was probably just being friendly, but listen, this man wants to make America great, and he don't even want to get paid to do it.
[01:11:58.345 --> 01:11:58.745]  That's right.
[01:11:58.765 --> 01:12:02.349]  That speaks volumes, and it tells you something about his character.
[01:12:02.609 --> 01:12:04.350]  He's putting his money where his mouth is.
[01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:04.811]  That's right.
[01:12:04.991 --> 01:12:08.694]  And he wants to work for the American people, and that's why the American people love him.
[01:12:09.014 --> 01:12:13.198]  That's why he's leading the polls, and that's why he's going to be our next president.
[01:12:13.298 --> 01:12:17.182]  And if you go to diamondandsilk.com, you'll see why we stopped for Trump.
[01:12:17.202 --> 01:12:17.422]  Yes.
[01:12:17.902 --> 01:12:21.686]  So it's his policies, it's why you ladies like him.
[01:12:21.706 --> 01:12:24.428]  Now, don't lie to me, do you also think Donald's handsome?
[01:12:25.869 --> 01:12:28.432]  Well, listen, yes he's handsome.
[01:12:28.632 --> 01:12:32.035]  But he's going to be our next president and that's what we're excited about.
[01:12:32.135 --> 01:12:36.779]  And we want everybody, forget about this media biasness and this propaganda.
[01:12:36.999 --> 01:12:43.846]  Don't pay it no attention, continue to stuff for Trump because that's what we're going to continue to do is stuff for him until we get him in that White House.
[01:12:44.246 --> 01:12:47.870]  Sure, I had a guest on yesterday and I said, listen, we can't pay for all these anchor babies.
[01:12:47.890 --> 01:12:48.711]  We're going bankrupt.
[01:12:49.091 --> 01:12:50.613]  Europe can't pay for all these immigrants.
[01:12:51.574 --> 01:12:53.897]  Why isn't the Arab countries taking the immigrants?
[01:12:53.937 --> 01:12:55.739]  And the guest said, oh, don't be racist.
[01:12:56.299 --> 01:13:02.106]  I mean, why is it that America is the only country that's supposed to pay for everything while we're going bankrupt?
[01:13:02.386 --> 01:13:03.708]  What happens when we go bankrupt?
[01:13:04.343 --> 01:13:05.063]  Well, you know what?
[01:13:05.083 --> 01:13:08.805]  Sometimes we get so used to robbing PETA to pay Paul.
[01:13:08.825 --> 01:13:09.225]  That's right.
[01:13:09.245 --> 01:13:10.566]  Charity starts at home.
[01:13:10.826 --> 01:13:19.610]  We need to take care of our own citizens first, our veterans, our people that's living in poverty, our people that's homeless and talking about Americans, talking about we'll work for food.
[01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:24.453]  Take care of those people first before we reach outside and start trying to take care of everybody else.
[01:13:24.493 --> 01:13:24.993]  That's right.
[01:13:25.765 --> 01:13:27.646]  When did you start to follow Donald Trump?
[01:13:27.666 --> 01:13:28.646]  Did you read about his politics?
[01:13:28.666 --> 01:13:29.986]  Did you watch him on TV?
[01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:37.949]  The first time he announced that he was running for president, I was in my bedroom watching him on CNN.
[01:13:38.009 --> 01:13:39.229]  And I call him CNN.
[01:13:39.309 --> 01:13:41.430]  And I called Silk.
[01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:42.611]  I said, cut the TV off.
[01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:45.051]  Donald is on talking about he's running for president.
[01:13:45.431 --> 01:13:47.712]  And midway through, Silk called me back.
[01:13:47.732 --> 01:13:50.473]  She said, girl, this is going to be our next president.
[01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:52.974]  And I've been loving him ever since.
[01:13:54.127 --> 01:13:59.689]  Well, it would be nice to have a president that doesn't run the country down constantly and try to ship our jobs overseas.
[01:14:00.069 --> 01:14:09.552]  I mean, I thought the Republicans were pretty bad before, and I was non-partisan, but I gotta say, Obama and the people that he works with really do seem like they have it out for this country.
[01:14:10.663 --> 01:14:11.703]  Well, you know what?
[01:14:12.103 --> 01:14:15.204]  We are survivors and we're not going to cry over spilled milk.
[01:14:15.505 --> 01:14:18.725]  What we want to do is put somebody in office that can clean up the milk.
[01:14:18.866 --> 01:14:20.506]  And that's why we stopped the Trump.
[01:14:20.746 --> 01:14:23.207]  And that's why we want him to be our next president.
[01:14:23.267 --> 01:14:24.607]  Well, ladies, you've got the floor.
[01:14:24.647 --> 01:14:27.208]  I could ask a lot of questions, but let me hear from Diamond.
[01:14:27.248 --> 01:14:28.689]  Let me hear from Silk, each of you.
[01:14:28.989 --> 01:14:33.150]  Your two minutes on why you like Donald Trump and what we can do to get Donald Trump elected.
[01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:37.418]  We like Donald Trump because Donald Trump wants to keep the American people safe.
[01:14:37.458 --> 01:14:37.758]  That's right.
[01:14:37.778 --> 01:14:39.699]  He wants to bring jobs back to this country.
[01:14:39.759 --> 01:14:52.606]  Did you know that companies like Ford Motor Company ship their jobs to Mexico to make products and manufacturing products for no more than a couple of dollars and then bring those products over here for us to buy them for $30,000, $40,000.
[01:14:53.607 --> 01:14:55.668]  This is what the American people need to know.
[01:14:55.868 --> 01:14:58.510]  Listen, he wants to bring these jobs back where we can thrive.
[01:14:58.790 --> 01:15:00.571]  He, listen, he makes sense.
[01:15:01.011 --> 01:15:03.732]  And he keeps doing this in a common sense approach.
[01:15:03.772 --> 01:15:07.534]  That's why we should stop the Trump, and that's why we should put him in the White House.
[01:15:07.594 --> 01:15:08.114]  That's right.
[01:15:08.314 --> 01:15:13.416]  And while all the other candidates is talking politics, Donald Trump is talking common sense.
[01:15:13.857 --> 01:15:18.739]  And he's bringing a common sense approach to these issues that's going on right now in this world.
[01:15:19.079 --> 01:15:21.120]  Donald Trump is the man for the job.
[01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:22.580]  He's a businessman.
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.101]  He knows economics.
[01:15:24.261 --> 01:15:26.182]  We're having economic issues right now.
[01:15:26.502 --> 01:15:27.083]  Guess what?
[01:15:27.143 --> 01:15:27.383]  What?
[01:15:27.503 --> 01:15:29.586]  He needs to be in the White House!
[01:15:29.786 --> 01:15:31.067]  He needs to be in the White House.
[01:15:31.288 --> 01:15:33.931]  And we've got to stop robbing Peter to pay Paul, y'all.
[01:15:34.171 --> 01:15:37.575]  We've got to stop that way of thinking because that's not going to get us nowhere.
[01:15:37.595 --> 01:15:41.219]  And listen, you're never going to attain the American dream by getting a handout.
[01:15:41.239 --> 01:15:41.479]  That's right.
[01:15:41.499 --> 01:15:44.983]  We need somebody that's going to give us a handout and show us how it's done.
[01:15:45.003 --> 01:15:45.364]  That's right.
[01:15:45.384 --> 01:15:46.926]  Yes, that's why we stop for Trump.
[01:15:47.981 --> 01:15:48.641]  Well, I know this.
[01:15:48.741 --> 01:15:53.223]  Donald Trump's saying a lot of stuff that's true and his businesses are based on having a thriving economy.
[01:15:53.763 --> 01:15:58.105]  He's the type of billionaire that will probably go under if the recession continues much longer.
[01:15:58.865 --> 01:16:02.026]  So that might be the motive for him actually wanting to do the right thing.
[01:16:02.386 --> 01:16:07.608]  There's so many other powerful elites, though, that want a managed, controlled economy, not a free market.
[01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:11.310]  And I just wonder what they're going to try next to try to stop Donald Trump.
[01:16:12.731 --> 01:16:16.793]  We don't know and that's why the American people have to get behind him.
[01:16:17.033 --> 01:16:21.535]  Stop listening to the media biasness and his propaganda and the things that they keep spinning.
[01:16:21.995 --> 01:16:26.497]  It's a weapon that they use to put doubt in the American people's minds.
[01:16:26.697 --> 01:16:29.799]  We've always allowed them to do it, but they won't do it this time.
[01:16:29.879 --> 01:16:32.380]  Get behind your candidate if you are a Democrat.
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:36.463]  Let's switch your party today so that we can vote our candidate in office, Donald Trump.
[01:16:36.503 --> 01:16:37.404]  And stay on message.
[01:16:37.504 --> 01:16:39.425]  And stay on message and stay on point.
[01:16:39.465 --> 01:16:40.486]  We're not about the fight.
[01:16:40.766 --> 01:16:42.027]  We're about the message.
[01:16:42.047 --> 01:16:44.589]  That's the message and getting this country moving again.
[01:16:44.649 --> 01:16:45.290]  Well, I like that.
[01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:48.212]  That's positive that you don't end fight with the other candidates and stuff.
[01:16:48.232 --> 01:16:49.553]  You just stay on message.
[01:16:49.573 --> 01:16:52.255]  But I tell you, I think the mainstream media is out of bullets.
[01:16:52.335 --> 01:17:00.462]  The more they attack him, the more they demonize him and make stuff up or exaggerate it or take it out of context, the more people like Donald Trump.
[01:17:01.042 --> 01:17:07.506]  I think he's kind of lessened some of his hardcore message lately, and that may be why he hasn't, you know, grown as fast.
[01:17:07.726 --> 01:17:12.108]  But he also exposed the vaccines, that we should have a right to not take them, and we're giving the kids too many.
[01:17:12.949 --> 01:17:18.552]  He's also been exposing the fact that there is a radical Islamic invasion of this country.
[01:17:19.252 --> 01:17:22.674]  He's talked about the fact that there's been a plan to de-industrialize the nation.
[01:17:23.515 --> 01:17:28.638]  He has said that the whole gun control movement's failed, and that we should have a right to
[01:17:29.378 --> 01:17:31.338]  Concealed carry just comes with the Constitution.
[01:17:31.739 --> 01:17:33.939]  So I tell you, he's really, really getting good.
[01:17:34.799 --> 01:17:39.240]  And I wonder if Donald Trump himself has woken up, or this is who he always was.
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:42.581]  Because the Donald Trump of 20 years ago was a lot more liberal.
[01:17:43.081 --> 01:17:44.881]  And so maybe he's just changed with the times.
[01:17:44.941 --> 01:17:50.042]  But I know he plugged us whenever Joe Biggs caught drug dealing on the border the day that Trump was there.
[01:17:50.823 --> 01:17:52.163]  So I mean, I know he does.
[01:17:53.643 --> 01:17:55.244]  He does seem to have a hardcore stance.
[01:17:55.264 --> 01:17:59.607]  He even talked about our Hillary shirt, our Hillary for prison shirt, and said that he liked it.
[01:18:00.328 --> 01:18:02.409]  So he does seem to be pretty hardcore.
[01:18:02.849 --> 01:18:05.431]  I just wonder what the establishment is going to do to try to shut him down.
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:13.928]  Well, I'll tell you what, whatever they try to do, the trickery and the fakery is not going to work, because we, the American people, are behind Donald Trump.
[01:18:13.968 --> 01:18:14.608]  And we see it.
[01:18:14.768 --> 01:18:18.432]  We see it, and we stand for Trump, and we want him in the White House.
[01:18:18.452 --> 01:18:18.732]  That's right.
[01:18:18.752 --> 01:18:20.094]  That's who we want in the White House.
[01:18:20.154 --> 01:18:20.474]  Yes.
[01:18:20.494 --> 01:18:22.837]  All right, ladies, I know you guys got to get back to work.
[01:18:22.857 --> 01:18:23.617]  We appreciate you.
[01:18:23.637 --> 01:18:26.801]  You got a few minutes left here, and we're talking to Diamond and Silk.
[01:18:27.561 --> 01:18:29.804]  Two political commentators popular on YouTube.
[01:18:29.824 --> 01:18:32.007]  A great example for other folks to get involved.
[01:18:32.027 --> 01:18:33.630]  Have your voice be heard, whatever your views are.
[01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:35.692]  DiamondAndSilk.com.
[01:18:36.093 --> 01:18:37.955]  In closing, how would you ladies like to leave us?
[01:18:38.925 --> 01:18:45.127]  Listen, if you are a Democrat and you need to switch your party, switch your party today, baby.
[01:18:45.347 --> 01:18:49.108]  So that you can vote for Donald Trump in the primaries is what we want you to do.
[01:18:49.288 --> 01:18:50.008]  And guess what?
[01:18:50.228 --> 01:18:55.069]  For my African Americans, in case y'all didn't know, Martin Luther King was a Republican.
[01:18:55.089 --> 01:18:56.830]  So let's get back to our roots, okay?
[01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:58.050]  Let's get back to our roots.
[01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:59.971]  Either y'all can stay left or get right.
[01:19:00.071 --> 01:19:02.151]  Get right and change your party.
[01:19:02.251 --> 01:19:05.552]  And it's nothing wrong with coming off the Democratic plantation, baby.
[01:19:06.013 --> 01:19:06.213]  Yes.
[01:19:06.333 --> 01:19:06.893]  I love it.
[01:19:08.701 --> 01:19:15.066]  Well, obviously the Democrats and Republicans have their history and their problems, but the Democrats really are the founders of the Klan.
[01:19:15.106 --> 01:19:18.008]  They really are social engineers.
[01:19:18.028 --> 01:19:20.589]  They're very nasty people at the top.
[01:19:20.609 --> 01:19:24.492]  They're really using people, and look at how black unemployment's doubled under Obama.
[01:19:25.313 --> 01:19:26.534]  Worse than all the other unemployment.
[01:19:26.554 --> 01:19:28.235]  I mean, how did that happen?
[01:19:29.173 --> 01:19:32.856]  See, I don't even want to discuss how it happened because I haven't a clue.
[01:19:33.217 --> 01:19:40.463]  That's why we need to put somebody in the White House that wants to bring our jobs back where our African Americans can thrive again in this country.
[01:19:40.643 --> 01:19:43.906]  They won't have to be in poverty, they can obtain the middle class now.
[01:19:44.226 --> 01:19:47.129]  And that's why we look at Donald Trump and that's why we stop for Trump.
[01:19:47.229 --> 01:19:48.590]  And stop just wanting the crumbs.
[01:19:48.730 --> 01:19:52.053]  Yes, it's time for us to have a slice of the cake, not just the crumbs.
[01:19:53.033 --> 01:19:57.054]  All right ladies, come back again with us, DiamondAndSilk.com.
[01:19:57.415 --> 01:19:58.135]  Very interesting.
[01:19:58.175 --> 01:20:00.115]  Thanks for being involved in the political process.
[01:20:00.476 --> 01:20:01.016]  God bless you.
[01:20:01.036 --> 01:20:01.956]  We'll be tuning in to you.
[01:20:03.777 --> 01:20:04.737]  Thank you, sweethearts.
[01:20:05.657 --> 01:20:07.978]  All right, you know they got a little pin-up of Donald Trump on the wall.
[01:20:09.085 --> 01:20:09.825]  Call me back!
[01:20:10.065 --> 01:20:14.927]  Turn on the news and you'll hear stories of natural disasters, political unrest, and financial crisis.

[01:20:40.003 --> 01:20:53.090]  So I found out the other day that at Guns80.com, a lot of people don't get the Ghost AR-15 rifle kits because they're afraid that they won't be able to do the machining work required to drill out and make ready the lower.
[01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:57.453]  Well listen, guys, gals, I am not that good of a machinist, I promise you.
[01:20:57.713 --> 01:21:04.036]  But I was able to take a drill press with an XY table and knock this out in about 45 minutes and in all honesty, mine looks really good.
[01:21:04.356 --> 01:21:06.137]  Go get yours, don't be afraid, it's easy.
[01:21:06.177 --> 01:21:06.518]  Guns80.com.
[01:21:06.538 --> 01:21:07.278]  Go to Guns80.com now.
[01:21:09.694 --> 01:21:22.262]  Atmospheric Aluminum, Mercury Exposure, Estrogen Toxins from Plastics, Microwaves from Cell Phones and Smart Meters, and Low Quality Foods, all combined to create conditions for the very high incidence of disease in our society.
[01:21:22.563 --> 01:21:30.928]  Now more than ever, we all need to be consuming those foods and herbs that epigenetically signal the cells of our body to produce energy, create proteins, and detoxify.
[01:21:31.088 --> 01:21:36.692]  When we properly support our bodies, then even in these toxic times, we can promote and achieve excellent health.
[01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:39.374]  One World Way is the first energetically encoded,
[01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:40.295]  I think so.
[01:22:09.213 --> 01:22:12.715]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:13.455 --> 01:22:13.956]  It's true.
[01:22:14.076 --> 01:22:18.018]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:18.218 --> 01:22:20.099]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:20.619 --> 01:22:25.082]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:25.382 --> 01:22:38.009]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.
[01:22:38.269 --> 01:22:41.771]  Big Berkey Water Filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[01:22:42.071 --> 01:22:44.353]  The gold standard in water purification.
[01:22:44.713 --> 01:22:48.735]  And our filters last for years at less than two cents per gallon.
[01:22:49.036 --> 01:22:49.656]  Big Berkey.
[01:22:49.856 --> 01:22:53.338]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[01:22:53.558 --> 01:22:55.160]  Get your Big Berkey today.

[01:22:58.422 --> 01:22:59.702]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[01:22:59.742 --> 01:23:00.823]  For the love of clean water.
[01:23:09.824 --> 01:23:11.306]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[01:23:11.746 --> 01:23:13.728]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[01:23:14.269 --> 01:23:17.913]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[01:23:18.153 --> 01:23:26.622]  Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[01:23:26.963 --> 01:23:30.246]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[01:23:31.107 --> 01:23:34.188]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[01:23:34.248 --> 01:23:38.829]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[01:23:39.609 --> 01:23:43.830]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[01:23:44.530 --> 01:23:47.331]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[01:23:47.691 --> 01:23:49.932]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[01:23:50.792 --> 01:23:57.036]  Please go to IDStronghold.com and get the facts and the wallet sleeves or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.
[01:23:57.817 --> 01:24:03.041]  You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[01:24:03.421 --> 01:24:05.142]  It is as though the protection is free.
[01:24:05.783 --> 01:24:07.424]  Visit IDStronghold.com today.
[01:24:20.134 --> 01:24:21.294]  Some folks are born.
[01:24:24.635 --> 01:24:29.277]  Some folks are born, made to wait to fly.
[01:24:30.017 --> 01:24:32.118]  The red, white, and blue.
[01:24:32.638 --> 01:24:34.259]  The red, white, and blue.
[01:24:35.139 --> 01:24:42.141]  And when the band plays, hell to the teeth, Lord knows, they point the cannon at you.
[01:24:42.201 --> 01:24:43.282]  Sound it!
[01:24:45.197 --> 01:24:50.960]  I love that line that leaves him when he says, we do the hanging.
[01:24:53.502 --> 01:24:55.683]  The hanging today is done inside the computers.
[01:24:55.903 --> 01:25:02.727]  We're going to break it down coming up after I take these calls that I've been holding as the Volkswagen scandal widens.
[01:25:05.088 --> 01:25:09.531]  Also, TSA agent, another case of it, stole passengers' money at checkpoint, police say.
[01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:15.653]  Report British Prime Minister David Cameron stuck genitals in dead pig's mouth.
[01:25:18.395 --> 01:25:21.057]  You gotta ask yourself, why is all this coming out now?
[01:25:21.157 --> 01:25:22.498]  Because it's how they control people.
[01:25:22.938 --> 01:25:30.883]  And in these college secret societies, where people have sex with animals and stuff, that's just a gateway into the real cult.
[01:25:32.324 --> 01:25:35.326]  And they're finding out, will you do this kind of stuff?
[01:25:35.346 --> 01:25:38.849]  I want to warn folks that are involved in college fraternities.
[01:25:40.233 --> 01:25:47.658]  Or if you're putting your kids in them, that a lot of fraternities aren't bad, but the more elite ones that are into all this stuff are super bad news.
[01:25:48.238 --> 01:25:55.683]  That ties into the pedophiles coming out of the closet, saying we've got to accept it and we've got to love them and we've got to see their courage and, you know, everything else.
[01:25:55.743 --> 01:25:57.044]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[01:25:59.206 --> 01:26:07.151]  The big drug scandal with the hedge fund manager doubling, tripling, quadrupling prices on AIDS drugs and hepatitis drugs.
[01:26:07.231 --> 01:26:08.312]  It's all just par for the course.
[01:26:10.814 --> 01:26:16.098]  You gotta ask, though, it's mainly just America, Canada, and a few European countries that allow this screwjob to go on.
[01:26:18.319 --> 01:26:19.660]  But right now, let's go to your calls.
[01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:20.621]  I'm just gonna go right through them.
[01:26:20.661 --> 01:26:28.005]  John, and Stephen, and Gordon, and Augusta, and Alabama, and Mama, and others.
[01:26:28.406 --> 01:26:29.366]  John, thanks for holding.
[01:26:29.406 --> 01:26:29.927]  You're on the air.
[01:26:29.967 --> 01:26:30.327]  Go ahead.
[01:26:31.708 --> 01:26:32.088]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:33.149 --> 01:26:36.211]  I wanna talk about Trump and Hillary, but I wanna talk about Trump first.
[01:26:37.031 --> 01:26:41.554]  You know, I watched Aaron Dyke's YouTube video he had up on air the last, well, 15 minutes.
[01:26:41.574 --> 01:26:50.080]  So all of Donald Trump's past interviews and stuff back when he was friends with Clinton and everything that he was for, now he's against.
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.882]  And it wasn't like two years ago he had a big conversion.
[01:26:52.902 --> 01:26:54.623]  It was right at election time.
[01:26:55.003 --> 01:27:06.351]  All of a sudden now he's this big conservative that is going to... And he's doing all these childish things to turn people off, like attacking that woman on her looks and stuff, you know, which was designed to turn a lot of people off, you know.
[01:27:07.458 --> 01:27:17.185]  Well, I've said it that I don't completely trust Donald Trump, and that I've got some problems with him, and that he should be watched, and he could be a giant ringer.
[01:27:17.686 --> 01:27:26.172]  But libertarians, conservatives, others are really supporting him right now, and so I'm here cautiously saying I support what he's saying, I support what he's doing.
[01:27:26.873 --> 01:27:28.274]  I think Rand Paul's a candidate.
[01:27:28.634 --> 01:27:32.757]  I support him for president, and Rand Paul's certainly been fighting
[01:27:34.608 --> 01:27:35.748]  A lot of tyranny as well.
[01:27:36.489 --> 01:27:38.989]  He just hasn't done it with Trump's flamboyant style.
[01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:47.532]  And yes, we've played those clips about how much he loves Hillary and how he's for assault weapons ban and, you know, we've played all those here as well.
[01:27:47.552 --> 01:27:51.473]  I don't know the particular clips you're talking about, but I've got a good idea.
[01:27:51.493 --> 01:27:54.394]  And so, yes, it is a real paradox.
[01:27:55.034 --> 01:27:56.154]  What does your gut tell you?
[01:27:56.455 --> 01:27:57.715]  Do you think Trump's going to be a ringer?
[01:28:00.370 --> 01:28:08.972]  The only way we can find out is if Hillary, for some reason, gets knocked out of the race and if it's Trump against Biden, well then I could vote for Trump.
[01:28:09.812 --> 01:28:22.294]  But if it's some kind of shenanigans behind the scenes where Hillary's going to get the nomination and he's already split up the Republican Party different ways... Well, I thought that could be the case.
[01:28:22.994 --> 01:28:25.775]  But I said, if he runs third party, we know he's shelling for Hillary.
[01:28:26.923 --> 01:28:31.566]  Because he would mainly just draw Republican and Libertarian voters over to ensure she won.
[01:28:32.027 --> 01:28:35.929]  Now he's pledged not to do that, which makes me think he won't do that.
[01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:37.611]  So that's another thing in his column.
[01:28:37.871 --> 01:28:39.192]  He came out against vaccines.
[01:28:39.472 --> 01:28:43.055]  He came out and said, the Constitution is your concealed carry.
[01:28:43.315 --> 01:28:45.116]  He's adopting patriot language.
[01:28:45.616 --> 01:28:49.059]  And so more and more stuff stacks up on his side.
[01:28:49.119 --> 01:28:50.840]  Before, I thought the weight was against him.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:51.801]  Now the weight's for him.
[01:28:52.161 --> 01:28:54.142]  I have to judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:28:56.337 --> 01:28:57.977]  Leopards don't tend to change their spots.
[01:28:58.597 --> 01:28:59.678]  He may be an operative.
[01:28:59.718 --> 01:29:00.618]  He may be a shill.
[01:29:02.298 --> 01:29:03.378]  Only time will tell.
[01:29:04.059 --> 01:29:05.119]  And so I agree with you.
[01:29:05.199 --> 01:29:06.059]  It bears watching.
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:15.921]  Hillary, a long time ago, I remember, Alex, that you interviewed a state trooper who was assigned to the Clintons when Bill was governor of Arkansas.
[01:29:15.961 --> 01:29:16.901]  You're the bodyguard for him.
[01:29:17.141 --> 01:29:18.662]  Man, you've been listening a long time.
[01:29:20.082 --> 01:29:20.362]  I have.
[01:29:20.602 --> 01:29:24.783]  And he said, I remember he said that the first time he laid eyes on Hillary,
[01:29:25.367 --> 01:29:29.931]  She came out and she had a sport and a big button on her dress that said proud member of the Communist Party.
[01:29:30.912 --> 01:29:33.955]  Oh yeah, she wears communist pins, they put them on the Christmas trees.
[01:29:35.236 --> 01:29:37.238]  They've had FBI agents go public that were in the White House.
[01:29:37.278 --> 01:29:38.259]  They just said it's insane.
[01:29:38.679 --> 01:29:43.644]  Crack pipes and linen and Stalin and Mao Christmas bolts.
[01:29:43.704 --> 01:29:44.464]  Christmas ornaments.
[01:29:44.505 --> 01:29:45.746]  People didn't believe that at the time.
[01:29:45.806 --> 01:29:46.747]  It later came out in court.
[01:29:47.751 --> 01:29:51.995]  By the way, Hillary had the IRS go after that FBI agent's foundation.
[01:29:53.377 --> 01:29:54.378]  So it's pretty bad.
[01:29:54.398 --> 01:29:55.539]  God bless you, John.
[01:29:55.579 --> 01:29:56.279]  We'll be back.
[01:29:56.319 --> 01:29:57.861]  John's been listening like 18 years.
[01:29:59.242 --> 01:30:00.143]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.644 --> 01:30:02.245]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.166 --> 01:30:05.869]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.972 --> 01:30:12.673]  Over the weekend, Cheryl Atkinson released the following article.
[01:30:12.834 --> 01:30:15.795]  What the news isn't saying about vaccine autism studies.
[01:30:16.095 --> 01:30:21.218]  She starts off with the New England Journal of Medicine study that says there is no link between vaccines and autism.
[01:30:21.458 --> 01:30:26.661]  She then discloses the consulting firm behind the study, the Lewin Group, lists major vaccine makers among its clients.
[01:30:26.861 --> 01:30:31.223]  In fact, the Lewin Group's parent company, United Health Group, is a key government partner in Obamacare.
[01:30:31.383 --> 01:30:36.365]  And a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, QSSI, was given the contract to build the Obamacare website.
[01:30:36.525 --> 01:30:50.029]  She then looks at the AstroTurf propaganda campaign and some of the buzzwords they use, like weak, too small, haphazard, not replicated, junk science, flawed, unrelated, and how these words are used over and over again to attack anybody who questions the vaccine mafia.
[01:30:50.189 --> 01:30:55.570]  She then covers over 13 different studies that show a correlation between vaccine intake and brain damage.
[01:30:55.590 --> 01:31:01.032]  In fact, permanent brain damage is an acknowledged rare side effect of vaccines, and there's no dispute in that arena.
[01:31:01.192 --> 01:31:06.360]  So the next time your herd mentality friends are pushing vaccine propaganda in your face, shove this back in theirs.
[01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:09.284]  Rob Dew for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:31:17.776 --> 01:31:18.116]  I don't know.
[01:31:39.774 --> 01:31:43.976]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[01:31:44.136 --> 01:31:48.097]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[01:31:48.298 --> 01:31:53.079]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:57.761]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[01:31:57.781 --> 01:32:01.223]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:32:01.383 --> 01:32:04.704]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:04.844 --> 01:32:06.645]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:09.446 --> 01:32:10.727]  It's now more clear than ever.
[01:32:10.907 --> 01:32:14.508]  The Globalists have launched a planetary destabilization plan.
[01:32:14.729 --> 01:32:18.350]  Here at the InfoWars operation, we hope and pray that this is not the case.
[01:32:18.610 --> 01:32:22.452]  But the signs of things deteriorating around the world are unmistakable.
[01:32:22.632 --> 01:32:29.256]  For many years, I've been working with my Patriot supply, and we have now developed a private label called InfoWars Select.
[01:32:29.416 --> 01:32:34.138]  Look, it's important to have firearms and water filtration during a collapse, but you've also got to have food.
[01:32:34.418 --> 01:32:38.480]  InfoWars Select is a wide variety of their highest quality packages,
[01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:42.181]  At the lowest price they have ever offered before.
[01:32:42.261 --> 01:32:44.562]  It's an introductory offer for only two weeks.
[01:32:44.762 --> 01:32:55.824]  Visit InfoWarsSelect.com or InfoWarsStore.com and find out why these meals are the highest quality, longest lasting, easiest to transport food solutions you're going to find anywhere.
[01:32:55.965 --> 01:32:58.145]  Visit InfoWarsSelect.com today.
[01:32:58.285 --> 01:33:01.886]  Watch the informational videos and check out the wide selection for yourselves.
[01:33:02.006 --> 01:33:05.227]  That's InfoWarsSelect.com or InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:33:05.488 --> 01:33:05.950]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:27.518 --> 01:33:33.622]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:34.023 --> 01:33:35.544]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:42.168]  Oh, I should have added earlier, I was just talking to him during the break, David Knight and Jakari Jackson are going to be in D.C.
[01:33:43.650 --> 01:33:52.034]  They're going to be in the other two states or cities where the Pope is going to be visiting over the next five days.
[01:33:52.114 --> 01:33:59.378]  The Pope, the Grand Pontiff, leaving Cuba will be landing at about three o'clock their time.
[01:34:01.972 --> 01:34:14.762]  in DC, so they're going to be there giving us pre-coverage and then live coverage today into the fourth hour that's going to be hosted by Paul Joseph Watson and some special guests that he has as well.
[01:34:15.462 --> 01:34:16.983]  Again, we're bringing the fourth hour back.
[01:34:17.404 --> 01:34:19.245]  For five or six years, I did a fourth hour.
[01:34:19.265 --> 01:34:23.749]  That first decade on radio, I just did the three hours, then we added a fourth hour.
[01:34:24.784 --> 01:34:32.230]  And then I just got too much launching the nightly news and building up the infrastructure, so I started getting rid of the fourth hour, but still had it there because occasionally I would do it.
[01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:34.592]  A lot of stations kept carrying the fourth hour.
[01:34:34.612 --> 01:34:35.773]  Well, now it's live every day.
[01:34:36.374 --> 01:34:40.357]  Sometimes I host, but it's always one of our other great reporters joining me as well.
[01:34:41.378 --> 01:34:50.466]  Rob Dube, Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo, Anthony Gucciardi, Paul Joseph Watson, Joe Biggs, and others.
[01:34:50.666 --> 01:34:51.727]  Kit Daniels, you name it.
[01:34:52.734 --> 01:34:55.216]  And it really is a jam-packed fourth hour.
[01:34:56.156 --> 01:35:01.319]  We're going to go to Stephen and Gordon and Augusta, Mama, A.D.
[01:35:01.519 --> 01:35:02.940]  and others here in just a moment.
[01:35:04.121 --> 01:35:12.726]  And then we're also going to get into the latest on the invasion of the migrants run by Saudi Arabia and others who won't take one single migrant.
[01:35:13.823 --> 01:35:16.505]  Even though they started the wars that basically caused so much of this.
[01:35:17.245 --> 01:35:20.207]  It's just classic how they guilt us into submission.
[01:35:21.167 --> 01:35:23.088]  I just talked to My Patriot Supply.
[01:35:23.108 --> 01:35:28.952]  They gave us only two weeks under the private label InfoWarsSelect.com.
[01:35:30.796 --> 01:35:37.640]  That's their entire food line, exact same product, exact same quality, the exact same age, recently produced.
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:39.821]  It's like a week old.
[01:35:40.001 --> 01:35:43.623]  That's how fast they're making this food, super high quality, lowest prices already.
[01:35:44.083 --> 01:35:52.647]  I was able to get an introductory deal, took me a while to twist their arm into this, to have prices that are basically 10% lower than any special they've ever offered.
[01:35:53.087 --> 01:35:56.629]  It is the lowest price at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:35:58.250 --> 01:35:59.671]  On InfoWars Select,
[01:36:01.331 --> 01:36:03.552]  That MyPatriot's ever offered.
[01:36:03.592 --> 01:36:09.194]  And we have the MyPatriot full spectrum of foods at their lowest prices right next to us.
[01:36:09.214 --> 01:36:13.456]  You can order the info or select the exact same thing at a lower price or get the MyPatriot supply.
[01:36:14.036 --> 01:36:18.978]  And I didn't really promote it like I wanted to.
[01:36:19.218 --> 01:36:20.439]  It's very popular though.
[01:36:20.819 --> 01:36:24.080]  So I have twisted their arm until October 1st and that's it.
[01:36:24.781 --> 01:36:25.941]  It was going to end Thursday.
[01:36:25.961 --> 01:36:28.122]  They have extended it one more week.
[01:36:30.652 --> 01:36:33.494]  So it's going to go until October 1st.
[01:36:33.554 --> 01:36:38.937]  You can get the lowest price in the best packaging, the plastic tote containers, you name it.
[01:36:39.317 --> 01:36:41.558]  A one month, a three month, a six month, a year.
[01:36:42.739 --> 01:36:43.139]  All of it.
[01:36:43.199 --> 01:36:46.802]  It is the very best high quality, storable foods you're going to find.
[01:36:46.842 --> 01:36:48.403]  It's what I and my family use.
[01:36:48.423 --> 01:36:51.084]  You can also call toll free and we'll take your order.
[01:36:51.104 --> 01:36:51.444]  888-253-3139.
[01:36:51.464 --> 01:36:51.504]  888-253-3139.
[01:36:58.683 --> 01:37:03.986]  The globalist social engineers want us to not be self-sufficient.
[01:37:04.006 --> 01:37:05.106]  They want us dependent on them.
[01:37:05.146 --> 01:37:05.306]  That's 101.
[01:37:06.107 --> 01:37:12.290]  So, having storable food, having firearms you know how to use, having high-quality water filtration is essential.
[01:37:13.471 --> 01:37:15.792]  And as for water filtration, you should be using that anyways.
[01:37:16.672 --> 01:37:26.057]  All major water supplies in all, what, 48 states, well, Hawaii has it too, so that's 49, has glyphosate in the water.
[01:37:26.097 --> 01:37:26.718]  That's Roundup.
[01:37:27.554 --> 01:37:31.155]  You talk about miracle growth for tumors, maybe it's it.
[01:37:32.236 --> 01:37:35.157]  That's now been proven in so many studies, it'll make your head spin and now admit it.
[01:37:36.557 --> 01:37:37.978]  And then you have the hundreds of other chemicals.
[01:37:38.058 --> 01:37:43.560]  The number one thing you can do in my experience is drink purified water, but it's gotta be the proper purified systems as well.
[01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:47.761]  We have the ProPure G2 systems that are the best price, highest quality.
[01:37:48.141 --> 01:37:54.644]  They're the same price as leading competitors or less, and they blow the competition away in double-blind scientific studies.
[01:37:55.464 --> 01:38:03.287]  We have those studies listed, we have taste tests listed, videos listed at InfoWarsStore.com in the water filtration section.
[01:38:03.487 --> 01:38:08.489]  And we have several other brands as well that are extremely high quality and also very cost effective.
[01:38:10.409 --> 01:38:12.930]  So that's my philosophy here is a win-win-win-win-win.
[01:38:13.010 --> 01:38:14.611]  Everything I promote is something I use.
[01:38:14.731 --> 01:38:16.472]  Everything I promote is something I know you need.
[01:38:16.772 --> 01:38:19.253]  Everything I promote is very competitively priced.
[01:38:19.793 --> 01:38:21.613]  I mean, I'm a flaming capitalist, folks.
[01:38:21.974 --> 01:38:22.714]  I'm out of the closet.
[01:38:23.598 --> 01:38:32.550]  I mean, I'm an extremist, pro-liberty, pro-human, pro-gun, pro-family, free-market capitalist, thumbing-at-the-mouth libertarian, laissez-faire.
[01:38:33.651 --> 01:38:34.913]  I'm just so liberal it's sick.
[01:38:36.308 --> 01:38:36.948]  You're like, liberal?
[01:38:36.968 --> 01:38:37.828]  You're a super conservative.
[01:38:37.848 --> 01:38:38.209]  Well, no, no.
[01:38:38.729 --> 01:38:40.069]  Liberals founded this country.
[01:38:40.589 --> 01:38:43.870]  They were liberal compared to the crown or compared to Europe or compared to the church.
[01:38:44.290 --> 01:38:45.170]  They were the real liberals.
[01:38:45.410 --> 01:38:46.611]  They're called classical liberals.
[01:38:46.671 --> 01:38:47.471]  That's what I am.
[01:38:47.831 --> 01:38:58.554]  And I see these cult member, scumbag gang member, thug, disintegration, control freaks that call themselves liberals that are just in trendy cults.
[01:38:58.974 --> 01:39:02.515]  And I feel sorry for them because they don't know what real liberalism is.
[01:39:03.783 --> 01:39:08.504]  They don't know it means more freedom, more choice, stay out of my life, keep more of your money.
[01:39:09.485 --> 01:39:11.925]  They believe it is the tyranny they promote.
[01:39:12.666 --> 01:39:20.948]  So I want to thank you all for helping fund this true constitutionalist, paleo-conservative, classical liberal, whatever name you give it.
[01:39:21.808 --> 01:39:23.189]  It's what made this country great.
[01:39:23.229 --> 01:39:25.109]  It's what made people want to come here.
[01:39:25.549 --> 01:39:27.570]  The freedom, the choice, the true diversity.
[01:39:28.601 --> 01:39:34.705]  It's not diversity when they tell kids you can't say boy or girl, he or she, mother or father, because someone else might get hurt.
[01:39:35.725 --> 01:39:38.727]  Well, I'm sorry if you're hurt, you don't have a daddy and I do.
[01:39:39.167 --> 01:39:40.028]  I didn't do that.
[01:39:40.788 --> 01:39:43.150]  That's total class warfare envy.
[01:39:45.734 --> 01:39:53.519]  I've noticed before that I've gotten rent cars, and they'll go, we've got a BMW for the same price as that Ford truck, you want a BMW?
[01:39:54.099 --> 01:39:56.761]  And I went, I guess, I've never driven a BMW, and it wasn't even a fancy one.
[01:39:57.041 --> 01:40:02.085]  People honking at me, people mad at me, people acting weird towards me, and I really noticed it.
[01:40:02.345 --> 01:40:07.228]  So another time I went on a trip, I got another luxury car again, and I did it again.
[01:40:07.248 --> 01:40:10.070]  I noticed, man, I really like driving a Ford truck.
[01:40:12.182 --> 01:40:15.183]  Because I don't want people thinking I got money or something.
[01:40:15.203 --> 01:40:21.065]  I mean, they have created such incredible class envy in this country, it makes my head spin.
[01:40:22.606 --> 01:40:28.888]  And even people that are middle class now get upset if somebody is better at sports than them or better in business.
[01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:32.030]  I mean, I would think you would admire that person and want to learn why they're successful.
[01:40:33.230 --> 01:40:36.731]  But this class warfare, class envy system is the death of this country.
[01:40:36.751 --> 01:40:37.612]  We've got to reverse it.
[01:40:38.372 --> 01:40:40.693]  And so for all of Donald Trump's problems,
[01:40:43.371 --> 01:40:51.244]  One of the positive things is, at least he's self-made, he's got his problems, but at least he's self-made and he makes it okay to be successful again.
[01:40:52.503 --> 01:40:58.026]  Because that's the type of examples we need for children to believe they can become successful.
[01:40:58.226 --> 01:41:03.609]  Because more rich people that are free market means more wealth for everybody else, more economy.
[01:41:04.369 --> 01:41:13.674]  The problem is the globalists are monopoly men, and they use gamed regulations, gamed stock markets, gamed interest rates to consolidate power, and they're waging war on the middle class.
[01:41:14.214 --> 01:41:15.235]  More on that coming up.
[01:41:17.537 --> 01:41:19.718]  We will sell out of Survival Shield Niacin Iodine X2.
[01:41:19.778 --> 01:41:20.879]  It's a major game changer.
[01:41:21.159 --> 01:41:22.640]  Incredible good halogen for the body.
[01:41:23.021 --> 01:41:24.622]  What it's done for me is just unspeakable.
[01:41:25.002 --> 01:41:25.982]  You've heard the rave reviews.
[01:41:26.002 --> 01:41:28.564]  You can read the reviews at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:41:29.004 --> 01:41:30.385]  That will sell out by next week.
[01:41:30.405 --> 01:41:32.767]  It'll be sold out for at least a month, so take advantage of that.
[01:41:33.167 --> 01:41:35.789]  We got a lot of the great knockout sleep aid back in.
[01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:37.550]  Getting great reviews on that front.
[01:41:39.226 --> 01:41:40.927]  Vitamin B12 is back in.
[01:41:41.607 --> 01:41:42.968]  Silver Bullet and more.
[01:41:43.108 --> 01:41:47.810]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:41:47.850 --> 01:41:48.970]  I'm done plugging.
[01:41:49.991 --> 01:41:57.114]  Okay, let's go back to your calls right now, then I'll get into the Volkswagen scandal widens that I mentioned last hour that I wanted to tell.
[01:41:57.414 --> 01:41:59.996]  Because through this story, you can understand everything.
[01:42:00.416 --> 01:42:04.498]  This is what I call a Rosetta Stone type issue.
[01:42:05.398 --> 01:42:07.219]  Steven in Florida, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:09.981]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[01:42:10.061 --> 01:42:16.446]  I've been trying to gather my thoughts rather than unhold so I don't sound like an incoherent, raving, religious maniac.
[01:42:17.306 --> 01:42:18.667]  But here's what I wanted to say.
[01:42:18.947 --> 01:42:28.955]  I've been thinking about the situation in Europe that you're going to be talking about with these so-called migrants and the implications for what's coming here in America.
[01:42:28.975 --> 01:42:31.677]  Now, here's what I'm getting at.
[01:42:32.457 --> 01:42:37.721]  We, most people in America, and especially, I've harped on this before, most Christians,
[01:42:38.405 --> 01:42:52.013]  Are so asleep and hypnotized by so much of what's going on in the religious realm that they're totally unaware of what's really coming and they're living in this presumption that we're just going to fly away before all this gets really bad.
[01:42:52.693 --> 01:42:54.274]  Well, I was... That's a cult!
[01:42:54.514 --> 01:42:58.636]  Don't worry about the volcano erupting and the lava flowing towards the town.
[01:42:58.897 --> 01:43:00.478]  We all take our mushrooms.
[01:43:01.338 --> 01:43:04.220]  It's like a new age cult or something, but it's the Christians.
[01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:06.421]  They just keep thinking everything's going to be fine.
[01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:13.656]  And I'm going to tie this into what you were just talking about with the widespread pedophilia and this perversion.
[01:43:13.676 --> 01:43:19.258]  I live right in the shadow of one of the major hubs of that, and that is Disney.
[01:43:19.498 --> 01:43:32.241]  And I was doing some research today, and you know, I've told people there's an Old Testament story about where the Philistines captured the Jewish ark, the centerpiece of the Jewish worship.
[01:43:33.141 --> 01:43:37.823]  And they got it back because the Philistines finally sent it back after it got plagued them.
[01:43:38.484 --> 01:43:44.927]  And so what they did was, on the cart that they sent it back with, they had what was termed five golden mice.
[01:43:45.787 --> 01:43:47.228]  They worshipped mice.
[01:43:47.388 --> 01:43:48.328]  Now I want you to get this.
[01:43:48.909 --> 01:43:55.552]  Here in Central Florida, and this is a fact of the world, the main religion here is the worship of the mouse.
[01:43:56.192 --> 01:43:56.712]  Disney.
[01:43:57.213 --> 01:43:57.473]  Okay?
[01:43:57.733 --> 01:44:00.034]  Which is one of the major hubs
[01:44:00.695 --> 01:44:08.942]  Or the sex trafficking rings that take these children and sell them through kiddie porn into these pedophilia rings worldwide.
[01:44:09.543 --> 01:44:22.914]  And the thing is, there are so many people, especially Christians, who give their money to this organization that's run by a bunch of pedophiles and sodomite perverts because it's run by the New World Order.
[01:44:22.994 --> 01:44:24.175]  You look into the history of
[01:44:24.608 --> 01:44:31.874]  Disney, the man himself, and you'll find this guy with a hardcore pornographer, kiddie porn, snuff films... Well, I'll say this.
[01:44:31.934 --> 01:44:32.514]  I'll say this.
[01:44:32.835 --> 01:44:37.358]  All Disney films have sexual subliminal messages in them, and it's documented.
[01:44:38.259 --> 01:44:40.401]  Um, and Disney is anti-gun.
[01:44:41.482 --> 01:44:49.751]  Disney admits that it works with the Pentagon with its ID bracelets and biometrics as a model for re-education camps worldwide.
[01:44:49.871 --> 01:44:51.834]  And by the way, folks, that's even been in the Washington Post.
[01:44:52.214 --> 01:44:53.335]  In fact, that sounds so insane.
[01:44:53.355 --> 01:44:59.642]  Will you guys search engine, uh, Disney, uh, works with Pentagon, uh, modeling control of cities.
[01:44:59.662 --> 01:45:00.483]  I think I'll pull it up.
[01:45:01.184 --> 01:45:09.952]  Because they've got on the East Coast this Disney community where people live there and they admit everything's tracked and the Pentagon used it as a model of control grids in Fallujah.
[01:45:10.412 --> 01:45:12.994]  And I mean even I couldn't believe this five, six years ago when I read it.
[01:45:13.234 --> 01:45:14.816]  And it was in like the Washington Post.
[01:45:14.836 --> 01:45:16.878]  That's what's so crazy about it.
[01:45:17.884 --> 01:45:19.585]  I first saw an article about it on an airplane.
[01:45:20.026 --> 01:45:21.507]  I was reading how great it was.
[01:45:21.527 --> 01:45:24.729]  And I don't want to say everybody that works for Disney is a pedophile.
[01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:27.531]  I don't know about them and snuff films and kiddie porn.
[01:45:28.312 --> 01:45:30.073]  I don't know what your evidence of that is, sir.
[01:45:30.694 --> 01:45:37.079]  But definitely, Disney is a major, major, major globalist operation.
[01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:41.883]  And they also are trying to change copyright law where they own words.
[01:45:42.603 --> 01:45:50.690]  Where, you know, I couldn't say the word Disney without paying them money, a royalty, all automated, and then they're the ones trying to lobby to end internet freedom.
[01:45:51.771 --> 01:45:57.415]  And so I won't, you know, be caught dead inside a Disney facility.
[01:45:58.496 --> 01:46:04.941]  I've thought about going to Disney just to document it, but I've been inside of it, you know, obviously when I was a child, and as an adult I've
[01:46:06.357 --> 01:46:10.042]  You know, been on the outskirts of it, but it's not very fun.
[01:46:10.082 --> 01:46:13.806]  I don't like big amusement parks and lines that are, you know, an hour long.
[01:46:14.467 --> 01:46:18.332]  But what is your proof of Disney involved in these pedo-rings?
[01:46:18.988 --> 01:46:28.976]  What I found was, the guy you've had on your shelf, Fritz Springmeier, with his 13 bloodlines Illuminati, he documents what Disney himself was actually into.
[01:46:28.996 --> 01:46:33.900]  You can go on and look this up for yourself, and he thoroughly documents.
[01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:36.502]  And what I want to tie it in with is the immigrants.
[01:46:36.602 --> 01:46:41.927]  Now, these guys are going around targeting women and children, okay?
[01:46:42.287 --> 01:46:44.889]  You consider that their founder, Muhammad,
[01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:47.151]  Alex, what I'm looking at happening in Europe
[01:47:08.012 --> 01:47:17.418]  It is cunning for here in America, and people better wake up because we are going to face the same thing here unless we rise up and stand up against tyranny.
[01:47:17.438 --> 01:47:17.778]  No, I hear you.
[01:47:17.798 --> 01:47:18.319]  I mean, listen.
[01:47:19.059 --> 01:47:27.665]  They are bringing in the most radical and downtrodden and poor people and ISIS folks, and they are robbing and carjacking and killing and attacking.
[01:47:28.465 --> 01:47:36.893]  And screaming, we hate America, we hate Europe, and their Imams, the big top ones, are on TV saying we're taking over, America's weak, Europe's weak, ah ha ha.
[01:47:37.333 --> 01:47:38.454]  And it is because we're weak.
[01:47:38.814 --> 01:47:45.961]  Political correctness has ended any culture, it has ended any basic controls of, quote, discrimination.
[01:47:45.981 --> 01:47:55.049]  And by discrimination, if I'm walking through a field at night with a flashlight, and I see a pit, I'm going to discriminate against it, I'm going to walk around it.
[01:47:56.211 --> 01:48:01.615]  And so, you know, you discriminate which restaurant you go to, you discriminate where you live, you know, for how far you want to drive.
[01:48:01.956 --> 01:48:18.769]  They've taken discrimination, stereotyping somebody because of what color they are, where they're from, and they've projected that on now to saying, you can't have individuality, you can't have your own culture, you've got to accept all this, and this is the plan to bring in a voting block,
[01:48:19.967 --> 01:48:31.049]  Uh, to have a political checkmate on Europe, but also Europe through social policies and the United States, I don't care if you're Hispanic, black or white, has less than two children.
[01:48:31.810 --> 01:48:39.431]  So yes, we do have to import people because of the social security Ponzi schemes to keep it going, but that's not what the establishment's doing.
[01:48:39.771 --> 01:48:42.112]  They're not bringing in people that have been screened
[01:48:42.572 --> 01:48:44.675]  Who want to work, who want to be part of the system.
[01:48:44.695 --> 01:48:53.867]  They're bringing them in and filling them full of these leftist ideologies, liberation theologies, and now we have the Pope coming, right as Congress, and I haven't gotten to this yet, it's huge news.
[01:48:54.761 --> 01:48:55.801]  Out of the New York Times.
[01:48:57.322 --> 01:48:58.322]  In fact, I had it here, guys.
[01:48:58.342 --> 01:48:59.262]  Will you bring me another one?
[01:48:59.362 --> 01:48:59.982]  It's been moved.
[01:49:00.022 --> 01:49:00.402]  Thank you.
[01:49:00.802 --> 01:49:01.603]  They've now come out.
[01:49:01.643 --> 01:49:02.023]  Here it is.
[01:49:02.443 --> 01:49:05.003]  Senate Democrats to unveil climate change bill.
[01:49:05.684 --> 01:49:06.944]  And I appreciate your call, Stephen.
[01:49:07.764 --> 01:49:10.365]  They couldn't get Congress five years ago to pass it.
[01:49:10.765 --> 01:49:13.005]  They couldn't get Congress three years ago to pass it again.
[01:49:13.345 --> 01:49:15.446]  So they had Obama do it by executive fiat.
[01:49:16.986 --> 01:49:19.827]  Over a thousand power plants have been shut down, totally clean ones.
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:23.361]  No one can come here because the energy is too expensive.
[01:49:23.421 --> 01:49:26.201]  I mean, you want to make it prohibitive to have jobs, that's what you do.
[01:49:26.822 --> 01:49:32.303]  And again, they know the public's dumb, so even in the New York Times they show coal plants and they say, look at all the smoke.
[01:49:32.863 --> 01:49:38.325]  That's water vapor and carbon dioxide because it's hot air hitting air that isn't as hot.
[01:49:38.925 --> 01:49:44.407]  Just like, you know, you're not exhaling smoke on a cold winter's day, you're exhaling 98.9 degree
[01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:51.812]  Air, and it's got water in it, so you're not breathing smoke.
[01:49:52.613 --> 01:49:56.835]  And if you show the New York Times article, they say look at all the pollution, and they show smokestacks.
[01:49:56.875 --> 01:49:58.296]  They're not smokestacks.
[01:49:58.956 --> 01:50:00.657]  They're smokestacks in Mexico and China.
[01:50:00.677 --> 01:50:01.778]  They have no scrubbers.
[01:50:02.098 --> 01:50:05.760]  The big buildings you see below power plants are the scrubbers.
[01:50:06.957 --> 01:50:08.098]  Everything goes through there.
[01:50:08.798 --> 01:50:11.440]  They use the byproducts and put it into alloys and steel.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.341]  So it's an amazing process.
[01:50:13.401 --> 01:50:14.422]  Coal is incredible.
[01:50:15.002 --> 01:50:20.105]  But even if you're against coal, why do we have to shut off our coal but nobody else does?
[01:50:21.246 --> 01:50:23.447]  Because the public looks at it and goes, look at the smoke.
[01:50:23.467 --> 01:50:24.508]  I don't want to breathe the smoke.
[01:50:25.688 --> 01:50:34.233]  Senate Democratic leaders today unveiled a plan and a measure intended to signal their support for President Obama's aggressive climate change agenda in 2016.
[01:50:37.395 --> 01:50:40.016]  And the Pope's going to show up and give a speech at Congress about it as well.
[01:50:40.096 --> 01:50:47.360]  I mean, this is what the new world order wants, to track everything you do, every action you take, but General Electric is exempt.
[01:50:48.941 --> 01:50:50.481]  So their plans can keep operating.
[01:50:51.442 --> 01:50:57.105]  It's the power to shut down all competition, just like Volkswagen, the people's card of ALOS.
[01:50:58.086 --> 01:50:59.367]  Designed by Adolf Hitler.
[01:51:00.788 --> 01:51:07.792]  They have it where when you go up for a missions test, it cheats the test because it does a handshake with the computer and then runs an op on it.
[01:51:10.302 --> 01:51:14.225]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:14.265 --> 01:51:17.167]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:17.348 --> 01:51:18.629]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:18.909 --> 01:51:21.871]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:22.131 --> 01:51:23.052]  Infidel Body Armor.

[01:51:24.013 --> 01:51:24.293]  Won't.
[01:51:24.453 --> 01:51:24.713]  Quit.

[01:51:43.042 --> 01:51:44.323]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:44.683 --> 01:51:47.025]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:47.505 --> 01:51:49.366]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:49.806 --> 01:51:53.849]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:51:54.309 --> 01:51:58.011]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[01:52:02.353 --> 01:52:03.774]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:52:09.525 --> 01:52:22.610]  So I found out the other day that at Guns80.com a lot of people don't get the Ghost AR-15 rifle kits because they're afraid that they won't be able to do the machining work required to drill out and make ready the lower.
[01:52:22.850 --> 01:52:26.951]  Well listen, guys, gals, I am not that good of a machinist, I promise you.
[01:52:27.231 --> 01:52:33.573]  But I was able to take a grill press with an XY table and knock this out in about 45 minutes and in all honesty, mine looks really good.

[01:54:26.293 --> 01:54:28.956]  We have to get out of our comfort zone with the globalists.
[01:54:28.976 --> 01:54:29.716]  We have to get angry.
[01:54:29.736 --> 01:54:30.617]  We have to get upset.
[01:54:30.637 --> 01:54:32.999]  We have to realize we're under attack.
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.121]  The rest will flow from that.
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:37.880]  We're going to go to break here in about six minutes.
[01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:40.461]  I'm going to come back and go to Gordon and Augusta.
[01:54:40.481 --> 01:54:43.062]  They've been holding the longest in for one segment.
[01:54:44.942 --> 01:54:51.864]  We've got the first report from the ground to cover the Pope's three-state visit that starts in the District of Criminals today.
[01:54:52.964 --> 01:54:53.904]  That is all coming up.
[01:54:55.465 --> 01:55:04.427]  But I love how I read the New York Times and there's nothing about how Congress didn't pass the law, the President doesn't have the authority to do this, but the President's going ahead with it.
[01:55:06.653 --> 01:55:07.594]  It's truly sickening.
[01:55:09.195 --> 01:55:14.498]  And if you think Obamacare shut the economy down, you let them get all the carbon taxes in, it's game over.
[01:55:14.998 --> 01:55:17.520]  Spain had a vibrant economy 10 years ago.
[01:55:18.321 --> 01:55:21.202]  They have 45% unemployment in people under 30.
[01:55:21.323 --> 01:55:25.505]  It's like 37% for the whole country.
[01:55:26.466 --> 01:55:28.847]  And it's because there's taxes on everything.
[01:55:29.268 --> 01:55:30.709]  And energy is so expensive.
[01:55:31.289 --> 01:55:32.530]  You want to shut a country down?
[01:55:34.687 --> 01:55:36.108]  You shut down their energy.
[01:55:36.169 --> 01:55:52.746]  Now, I talked a lot about this earlier, and I talked a lot about how Volkswagen is such a great example, a microcosm of all of this, and it just really is.
[01:55:54.246 --> 01:56:13.283]  Everybody's, oh Volkswagen's in trouble, oh Volkswagen's been so bad, oh my gosh can you believe that their stock is massively plunging and they've lost billions and there's 11 million cars and they're so evil and how dare them that when you put the diesel car up on to the computerized system
[01:56:14.685 --> 01:56:20.190]  It then shifts into another mode to lower emissions and fools the machine to pass the emissions.
[01:56:20.850 --> 01:56:27.075]  That's because Europe is trying to follow a 60% emissions drop by 2020.
[01:56:29.297 --> 01:56:37.224]  And if you do that, you will cripple the economy and you will cripple the power of the cars and you will massively basically make it untenable.
[01:56:39.146 --> 01:56:41.868]  And Europe is designed with its refineries to run on diesel.
[01:56:44.594 --> 01:56:45.654]  And diesel is dirty.
[01:56:47.675 --> 01:57:07.103]  And so rather than being honest about that, Volkswagen went in with a computerized system that when it handshakes with the other computer, it says, just a moment please, in computer speak, just a moment, just a moment, waiting, waiting, while it's connecting, while it goes back in a split second and says, shift into a mode that fools this.
[01:57:08.604 --> 01:57:10.925]  And the big story here, the big takeaway is,
[01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:16.193]  I've never seen a smart piece of technology that didn't have Trojans in it.
[01:57:17.054 --> 01:57:20.918]  I've never seen anything with the word smart on it that isn't a screw job.
[01:57:21.698 --> 01:57:23.900]  You want to have your thermostat controlled by outside sources?
[01:57:24.220 --> 01:57:24.761]  Get one of them.
[01:57:25.562 --> 01:57:28.164]  You want to have your power turned on and off?
[01:57:28.444 --> 01:57:30.005]  You want to be double, triple charged?
[01:57:31.186 --> 01:57:32.368]  You want to be surveilled?
[01:57:33.008 --> 01:57:36.091]  For at least eight years, every new car made in the world
[01:57:37.756 --> 01:57:42.700]  Whether it was in South Korea, Japan, China, Mexico, the US, Canada, Germany, France, it didn't matter.
[01:57:43.761 --> 01:57:51.568]  Whether it was a Saab or a Toyota, a Ford or a Chevy, a Dodge or a Fiat, a Jeep or a Jaguar.
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:53.420]  It didn't matter.
[01:57:54.200 --> 01:58:10.004]  They all have boxes in them that track everywhere you go, what you do, how fast you drive, and they admit, oh, this just happens to interface with government systems going in Oregon, Washington, Texas, D.C., London, you know, cities and states everywhere.
[01:58:10.484 --> 01:58:11.985]  That's gonna tax you by the mile.
[01:58:12.545 --> 01:58:14.906]  Wow, it wirelessly interfaces.
[01:58:15.006 --> 01:58:20.647]  It just fell in your car by accident and does this, and the public goes, gee, ain't that nice?
[01:58:22.159 --> 01:58:28.421]  And they go, that's right, we've got less fuel tax coming in, which isn't even true, so we need to wirelessly tax you.
[01:58:29.161 --> 01:58:31.782]  And this Trojan horse stuff just fell on your car.
[01:58:31.822 --> 01:58:33.403]  It's kind of like people that believe in evolution.
[01:58:33.423 --> 01:58:34.763]  You know, they believe in pure evolution.
[01:58:35.023 --> 01:58:37.064]  Yeah, just killer whales just appeared.
[01:58:38.144 --> 01:58:40.885]  And, you know, this Rolex just fell out of the sky, too.
[01:58:41.045 --> 01:58:42.886]  And the elite don't even believe that.
[01:58:44.987 --> 01:58:45.688]  It's just incredible.
[01:58:46.009 --> 01:58:47.170]  It's all by design.
[01:58:47.230 --> 01:58:49.573]  It's total takeover through all tech.
[01:58:49.673 --> 01:58:51.075]  It is the end of freedom as we know it.
[01:58:51.375 --> 01:58:52.377]  It must be resisted.
[01:58:52.877 --> 01:58:54.800]  It is the sneak attack globalist takeover.
[01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:55.320]  Stay with us.
[01:58:59.875 --> 01:59:04.897]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[02:00:01.781 --> 02:00:04.392]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:15.905 --> 02:00:16.525]  Big Brother.
[02:00:17.206 --> 02:00:18.247]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:18.967 --> 02:00:20.048]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:20.728 --> 02:00:21.529]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:23.230]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.851 --> 02:00:27.473]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.054 --> 02:00:32.137]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.117 --> 02:00:39.922]  There are hundreds of angles to this Volkswagen story, but they're about to reintroduce the Volkswagen bus that all the trendies like.
[02:00:40.342 --> 02:00:41.643]  And my parents had one when I was a kid.
[02:00:42.084 --> 02:00:43.385]  Blue, baby blue, I loved it.
[02:00:44.705 --> 02:00:46.045]  They're introducing a clean one.
[02:00:46.526 --> 02:00:48.106]  Well, that's with this game technology.
[02:00:48.426 --> 02:00:51.547]  So the trendies can feel good about their emissions and it's not even real.
[02:00:52.387 --> 02:00:53.867]  But you heard the prediction here first.
[02:00:54.027 --> 02:01:07.190]  I bet you my bottom dollar that BMW, that Toyota, that all of them are doing the exact same thing because these targets are impossible to reach.
[02:01:07.210 --> 02:01:09.310]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:01:10.711 --> 02:01:11.591]  I have a Dodge Hellcat.
[02:01:12.848 --> 02:01:17.296]  And there are federal taxes involved in its emissions and its engine size.
[02:01:17.717 --> 02:01:18.818]  It's a gas guzzler tax.
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:26.091]  To not make it even another category worse, because it has the horsepower of one of the most powerful 18-wheelers out there, but geared differently.
[02:01:26.946 --> 02:01:30.468]  It's over 730-something horsepower other taxes hit in.
[02:01:30.949 --> 02:01:41.296]  It turns out the car is basically 800 horsepower or more when you actually study the drivetrain, but they just say it's 711 to get out from under the taxes.
[02:01:41.956 --> 02:01:43.177]  And I just salute them.
[02:01:43.317 --> 02:01:45.098]  I mean, you know, that's what it's all about.
[02:01:45.219 --> 02:01:48.801]  So you just drive your fake little Volkswagen and feel good about yourself.
[02:01:49.341 --> 02:01:51.022]  I'll just get behind my big hog
[02:01:51.923 --> 02:01:52.884]  And just knock it out.
[02:01:53.084 --> 02:01:53.685]  How's that sound?
[02:01:54.386 --> 02:02:00.292]  And I'm just gonna spray stuff all over the highway that the plants and trees just love and enjoy and lap up.
[02:02:01.333 --> 02:02:03.395]  Because this planet was born out of carbon.
[02:02:04.377 --> 02:02:05.718]  Plants have got a habit to live.
[02:02:06.239 --> 02:02:08.181]  Gordon in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:02:10.191 --> 02:02:11.512]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:02:11.552 --> 02:02:18.856]  I served my country in the infantry for five years, and I wanted to talk to you today about four things.
[02:02:18.996 --> 02:02:22.458]  Trump, pedophilia, technology, and politics.
[02:02:22.518 --> 02:02:23.939]  Well, you got the floor for three minutes.
[02:02:23.959 --> 02:02:24.279]  Go ahead.
[02:02:25.854 --> 02:02:26.254]  Thank you.
[02:02:26.314 --> 02:02:30.037]  There's an old expression, be careful of what you pray for, you might just get it.
[02:02:30.057 --> 02:02:31.939]  I think that's what we're heading for with Trump.
[02:02:32.399 --> 02:02:36.782]  You can judge a man by his character, by the company he keeps, I'm sure you would agree with that.
[02:02:36.822 --> 02:02:37.022]  Yes.
[02:02:37.483 --> 02:02:53.715]  And Jeffrey Epstein, I'm sure your listeners know who this man is, he's a convicted sex offender, kept company with the likes of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Alan Dershowitz, flew around an aircraft called the Lolita Express, a 727, all around the world.
[02:02:55.516 --> 02:02:57.580]  I knew about the investigation.
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:02:59.883]  Trump hangs out with those folks?
[02:02:59.923 --> 02:02:59.983]  Wow.
[02:03:06.633 --> 02:03:18.637]  Also, Donald Trump's business partner is a gentleman in a consortium with Bayrock Group LLC, a property group that's partnered with the Trump Organization to build a Soho Hotel condominium and a Trump Tower in Florida.
[02:03:18.978 --> 02:03:27.681]  He was arrested by Turkish police who swooped down in helicopters on a yacht in the Mediterranean and found underage hookers on board.
[02:03:27.981 --> 02:03:33.483]  So these are the types of people that Donald Trump is rubbing elbows with, so I don't endorse
[02:03:34.443 --> 02:03:41.708]  Either Ron Paul, Rand Paul, any politician, I think they're all corrupt to the eyeballs.
[02:03:42.008 --> 02:03:59.358]  As far as people trying to judge your character, Alex, with mainstream media like Salon and mainstream media, I really think those are all, again, controlled by what I refer to as dying-as-Jew Jewish media.
[02:04:00.118 --> 02:04:02.539]  And the same thing with politics.
[02:04:02.559 --> 02:04:05.040]  When you look at the politics, the U.S.
[02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:10.162]  Congress is primarily run by the American-Israeli Political Action Committee.
[02:04:11.142 --> 02:04:13.463]  Let's just call a spade a spade here.
[02:04:13.923 --> 02:04:22.926]  As far as technology is concerned, Boeing has an uninterruptible autopilot switch on their aircraft, which makes me think about 9-11, and it really makes me
[02:04:23.126 --> 02:04:28.273]  Yeah, both those aircraft that hit the towers did have that on them, and then Bush even gave a speech and admitted that.
[02:04:28.734 --> 02:04:34.521]  You know, there's no doubt a Jewish mafia that's leftist in many respects.
[02:04:34.541 --> 02:04:37.225]  There's definitely a right-wing Jewish lobby as well.
[02:04:37.646 --> 02:04:38.807]  I don't say it's one big
[02:04:39.468 --> 02:04:40.649]  We're good to go.
[02:05:09.793 --> 02:05:11.975]  Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[02:05:12.055 --> 02:05:14.917]  Did you know that Pope Francis has strong ties to communism?
[02:05:15.177 --> 02:05:21.421]  Francis is a member of the Jesuits who developed the so-called liberation theology, which many have labeled Christianized Marxism.
[02:05:21.641 --> 02:05:25.824]  They're the reason why communism and socialism has persevered for so long in Latin America.
[02:05:26.065 --> 02:05:31.989]  And it's not a coincidence that Cuba's current leader, Raul Castro, praised Pope Francis for his anti-capitalist stance.
[02:05:32.249 --> 02:05:34.931]  Castro, like Francis, was also brought up by the Jesuits.
[02:05:35.231 --> 02:05:40.473]  Starting to make sense now why Francis is constantly calling for carbon taxes and more government?
[02:05:40.713 --> 02:05:43.454]  And also, did you know the recent reconciliation between the U.S.
[02:05:43.494 --> 02:05:46.736]  and Cuba was spearheaded by Pope Francis to the benefit of Castro?
[02:05:46.996 --> 02:05:55.119]  Vatican researcher Leo Zagami wrote an excellent article on InfoWars.com entitled, Vatican Flag to Fly Over the New World Order, which breaks it all down.
[02:05:55.399 --> 02:06:05.486]  Zoghami wrote, Barack Obama and Raul Castro's mundialist leftist agenda is guided and supervised by the first Jesuit Pope in history to help the Cubans embrace the new world order with enthusiasm.
[02:06:05.606 --> 02:06:09.269]  Keep checking InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv for more reports.
[02:06:09.609 --> 02:06:10.910]  It's now more clear than ever.
[02:06:11.090 --> 02:06:14.633]  The globalists have launched a planetary destabilization plan.
[02:06:14.893 --> 02:06:18.496]  Here at the InfoWars operation, we hope and pray that this is not the case.
[02:06:18.776 --> 02:06:22.618]  But the signs of things deteriorating around the world are unmistakable.
[02:06:22.799 --> 02:06:29.423]  For many years, I've been working with MyPatriotSupply, and we have now developed a private label called InfoWars Select.
[02:06:29.583 --> 02:06:34.346]  Look, it's important to have firearms and water filtration during a collapse, but you've also got to have food.
[02:06:34.366 --> 02:06:42.252]  InfoWars Select is a wide variety of their highest quality packages at the lowest price they have ever offered before.
[02:06:42.432 --> 02:06:44.733]  That's an introductory offer for only two weeks.

[02:07:09.380 --> 02:07:18.385]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:07:18.465 --> 02:07:23.048]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico.
[02:07:23.168 --> 02:07:26.691]  Where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:07:26.871 --> 02:07:31.555]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:07:31.735 --> 02:07:38.440]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:45.606]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:07:45.686 --> 02:07:47.507]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:07:47.607 --> 02:07:52.568]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:07:52.728 --> 02:07:57.070]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:07:57.210 --> 02:08:00.471]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:08:00.591 --> 02:08:06.713]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:08:06.893 --> 02:08:08.574]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:08:18.795 --> 02:08:30.650]  Broadcasting live, worldwide.
[02:08:30.690 --> 02:08:31.291]  Oh yeah!
[02:08:31.311 --> 02:08:34.555]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:08:35.396 --> 02:08:37.078]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:48.114]  Augusta, Mama, A.D., Dave, Doug, your calls are coming up starting the next segment.
[02:08:48.134 --> 02:08:53.077]  Then I'm going to plow back into the news, the breaking news that we have not hit yet.
[02:08:54.798 --> 02:09:02.284]  But one more point before we go to Washington, D.C., where our reporters are in front of the White House reporting on the grand papal visitation.
[02:09:03.769 --> 02:09:05.250]  That is about to take place.
[02:09:06.071 --> 02:09:07.132]  A story out of Forbes.
[02:09:07.432 --> 02:09:09.474]  Far out and for real.
[02:09:09.614 --> 02:09:15.419]  New VW microbus coming and it's clean with the lowest emission standards out there.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.284]  So they get all these emission standards passed out of Germany, EU wide, some of the worst in the world.
[02:09:21.304 --> 02:09:27.789]  60 plus percent cuts on the emissions that are already there of carbon dioxide and water.
[02:09:30.171 --> 02:09:31.793]  Not monoxide, dioxide.
[02:09:33.220 --> 02:09:39.427]  Where it's impossible to pass, so they know they can't have any competition and leave them able to be sold in Germany.
[02:09:39.768 --> 02:09:46.936]  And then of course, when you hook it up to the computer, it recognizes it's being checked, and then gives a false report.
[02:09:48.092 --> 02:09:50.053]  Of course, that's what you can do with computers.
[02:09:50.273 --> 02:09:52.594]  Oh, trust the voting machines and those proven fraud.
[02:09:53.115 --> 02:09:56.076]  Oh, trust the smart meter, the Zeitgeist Movement.
[02:09:56.676 --> 02:09:59.738]  Oh, a computer will pick what job you have and what food you eat.
[02:09:59.778 --> 02:10:00.959]  That's what school kids are taught.
[02:10:01.259 --> 02:10:03.960]  In the future, computers will decide what you're going to be, what you do.
[02:10:03.980 --> 02:10:06.701]  It's like DNA tests.
[02:10:06.982 --> 02:10:07.962]  You can just rig those.
[02:10:08.783 --> 02:10:11.384]  Stop being so naive, is what I'm saying.
[02:10:13.237 --> 02:10:16.018]  But at another level, humans want to innovate.
[02:10:16.078 --> 02:10:17.278]  Humans want to be competitive.
[02:10:17.318 --> 02:10:18.498]  Humans want better things.
[02:10:18.799 --> 02:10:19.599]  Humans dream.
[02:10:20.879 --> 02:10:24.560]  And I know in my heart that people aren't going to go along with the new dark age.
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:27.621]  People aren't going to go along with all this censorship of technology.
[02:10:27.941 --> 02:10:29.061]  People want to innovate.
[02:10:29.081 --> 02:10:30.902]  That's what the Renaissance was about.
[02:10:31.942 --> 02:10:38.704]  The globalist movement of the last 165 years or so has been about suppressing and controlling human expansion.
[02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:45.993]  And branding it as dirty and bad, while they've been stifling us, and are actually the ones hurting the Earth the worst.
[02:10:46.413 --> 02:10:51.916]  Because they already think they're going to be gods, they're going to merge with technology, and so they think they've transcended the planet.
[02:10:52.456 --> 02:10:55.918]  Oh, we weren't meant to save the planet, we were meant to leave the planet.
[02:10:56.198 --> 02:10:58.219]  How about we save the planet and leave the planet?
[02:10:59.259 --> 02:11:03.501]  You know, just because I move out of my parents' house when I'm 17 doesn't mean I blow it up.
[02:11:05.382 --> 02:11:06.663]  Just because my family
[02:11:08.689 --> 02:11:12.513]  In England, went to the Netherlands, and then to the United States on the Mayflower on both sides.
[02:11:12.833 --> 02:11:18.358]  Didn't mean we wanted to blow up the floating, capsizing island of England.
[02:11:18.378 --> 02:11:21.961]  Being sarcastic, remember the Congressman thinks that islands float.
[02:11:22.482 --> 02:11:25.024]  If too many people get on one side, would it flip over?
[02:11:25.865 --> 02:11:28.728]  The Admiral says, no sir, we believe we'll stabilize the island.
[02:11:30.990 --> 02:11:33.312]  I mean, this is the idiocy that we're dealing with.
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:39.243]  So joining us to kick off the coverage, he arrives in an hour and a half or so.
[02:11:39.263 --> 02:11:40.843]  They're going to be covering that.
[02:11:40.863 --> 02:11:42.144]  They're going to be on the nightly news tonight.
[02:11:42.164 --> 02:11:43.545]  They're going to be on with us tomorrow.
[02:11:43.565 --> 02:11:45.006]  They're going to be talking to men on the street.
[02:11:45.026 --> 02:11:47.187]  They're going to be illustrating what the First Amendment is.
[02:11:47.207 --> 02:12:00.194]  They're going to be exposing the new Pope showing up as a dynamic duo of snot-nosed communists run by big banks crawling out from under their Ford Foundation Jesuit rocks to promote
[02:12:00.814 --> 02:12:04.735]  World government to promote every form of tyranny you can imagine.
[02:12:05.295 --> 02:12:09.056]  The headline, Pope Francis brings tough love to America.
[02:12:09.316 --> 02:12:23.139]  The foreign above the law head of state showing up to lecture Americans and lecture Catholics on how air conditioning and prosperity is bad when he lives in an air conditioned facility.
[02:12:24.170 --> 02:12:32.337]  It's austerity, it's globalist eugenics operation, and David Knight is here to kick off our coverage of the sickening event.
[02:12:32.738 --> 02:12:34.759]  The first time a Pope is going to address Congress.
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:38.543]  This is just unbelievable.
[02:12:38.563 --> 02:12:40.485]  And again, I'm not an anti-Catholic person.
[02:12:40.905 --> 02:12:42.086]  I am anti this Pope.
[02:12:42.526 --> 02:12:43.948]  This guy is anti-Catholic.
[02:12:44.448 --> 02:12:48.752]  From everything I've seen, he is just absolutely monstrous.
[02:12:49.152 --> 02:12:53.376]  He's backed off a bit, saying abortion's okay, but that's because of pressure.
[02:12:53.776 --> 02:12:55.778]  We need to pressure this guy back under his rock.
[02:12:56.538 --> 02:13:07.388]  David Knight, you're there, His Holiness, His Supreme Grandness, who holds the keys of temporal and spiritual power, Lord Baphomet, is now arriving.
[02:13:07.408 --> 02:13:08.469]  What do you have to say about it?
[02:13:09.750 --> 02:13:11.511]  Alex, this is David Knight and Jakari Jackson.
[02:13:11.531 --> 02:13:14.092]  We're here in Washington, D.C., right in front of the White House.
[02:13:14.132 --> 02:13:16.894]  Of course, the Pope is going to be arriving in about two hours.
[02:13:17.414 --> 02:13:21.636]  He's going to be visiting with Obama tomorrow, as well as lecturing Congress.
[02:13:21.676 --> 02:13:30.200]  And then he's going to go to the United Nations and tell them what they want to hear, that we need to turn everything over for global climate indulgences.
[02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:33.842]  But there's also another agenda, Alex, and that is open borders.
[02:13:34.625 --> 02:13:41.507]  Both of these are being sold as saving the planet, doing this for the children, helping families, but they're both beating a globalist agenda.
[02:13:41.567 --> 02:13:47.469]  And an example of that, Alex, is the fact that he's going to be holding the mass here in Washington.
[02:13:47.489 --> 02:13:48.929]  It's going to be held in Spanish.
[02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:54.951]  Furthermore, it is the first and only canonization mass they've had in America.
[02:13:56.311 --> 02:14:02.655]  He's going to canonize, in other words, make a saint, a Father Sarah, who was one of the earliest missionaries into California back in 1749.
[02:14:03.236 --> 02:14:12.242]  And many people who are commenting on this say this is clearly sending a message that we have a dual heritage here in America.
[02:14:12.262 --> 02:14:15.684]  It's not just the English settling in Jamestown 120 years earlier.
[02:14:15.824 --> 02:14:20.448]  No, the important thing is the Spanish colonization of California.
[02:14:20.728 --> 02:14:22.269]  And what makes this interesting, Alex,
[02:14:22.947 --> 02:14:50.121]  is that in this particular case father sarah there's been a lot of controversy about him and and there's a lot of pushback from people criticizing the pope for canonizing uh... father sarah because of the harsh treatment of the uh... native americans of the indians that were there at the time let's just be honest they used him for slave labor yeah yeah and just this year but it's ok because the catholic church did it so now it's fine and they're now announcing that l a is the capital of latin america this is all part of the globalist takeover
[02:14:50.774 --> 02:14:51.194]  Exactly.
[02:14:51.515 --> 02:14:59.121]  Just this year, the California Legislature tried to remove a statue of Father Sarah from the California Legislative Building.
[02:14:59.562 --> 02:15:02.044]  And so that's how unpopular, how controversial it is.
[02:15:02.404 --> 02:15:03.926]  But the Pope is doubling down.
[02:15:04.246 --> 02:15:12.773]  He wants to have someone who portrays this whole Aslan narrative of the fact that the Southwest of America really belongs to Mexico.
[02:15:12.853 --> 02:15:13.994]  I believe that's what's behind this.
[02:15:14.535 --> 02:15:15.095]  Many people do.
[02:15:15.115 --> 02:15:16.697]  But of course, so there's an open borders.
[02:15:17.077 --> 02:15:25.594]  Globalist agenda, there is a climate change carbon tax credit kind of indulgence that we would pay to the global elite billionaires.
[02:15:25.874 --> 02:15:27.698]  That's also going to be pushed in this visit.
[02:15:29.048 --> 02:15:35.709]  Well, it's truly sickening to see the full court press of the U.N., Obama, the Pope, global government, global taxes.
[02:15:36.269 --> 02:15:45.451]  The Democrats are introducing legislation, well they introduced it this morning, to try to shut down everything and track us and use smart meters to tax everything we do.
[02:15:45.691 --> 02:15:47.212]  But of course they're going to be exempt from it.
[02:15:47.472 --> 02:15:50.192]  This is a total takeover and the Pope is making his move.
[02:15:50.212 --> 02:15:53.073]  And I'll say this, whether the Catholic Church was good or bad before,
[02:15:53.633 --> 02:16:01.062]  It has been taken over by UN Central Intelligence Agency slash EU bureaucrats using a pedophile scandal.
[02:16:01.102 --> 02:16:02.244]  Even The Guardian admits that.
[02:16:02.644 --> 02:16:04.747]  It is now state-run religion.
[02:16:05.047 --> 02:16:08.452]  The Vatican has fallen to the New World Order.
[02:16:09.152 --> 02:16:11.776]  Any way you slice it, it is now a total engine of evil.
[02:16:12.776 --> 02:16:18.097]  They have actually no interest whatsoever in the massive changes that are going on here in America.
[02:16:18.217 --> 02:16:22.198]  You would think that he'd be talking about that, but he's got an agenda of climate change.
[02:16:22.538 --> 02:16:23.418]  We knew this was coming.
[02:16:23.659 --> 02:16:25.319]  He put out the encyclical this summer.
[02:16:25.939 --> 02:16:29.040]  It didn't get, surprisingly, that much coverage from most people.
[02:16:29.100 --> 02:16:33.161]  Polls right after he did it said only about a third of Americans were even aware of it, only 40% of Catholics.
[02:16:35.002 --> 02:16:39.405]  I don't know how many agreed with him and how many disagreed with him, but they were not even aware of it.
[02:16:39.445 --> 02:16:44.589]  So he's coming here with all the pomp and the circumstance to draw attention to that agenda.
[02:16:44.649 --> 02:16:47.391]  And he's calling for a revolution in America.
[02:16:47.451 --> 02:16:53.855]  He's coming here and he has his viceroys, his cardinals in the U.S.
[02:16:53.916 --> 02:16:54.936]  calling for open borders.
[02:16:55.236 --> 02:16:59.700]  How about he calls for the Vatican to lower its walls and give its money to Latin America?
[02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:01.301]  I mean it's just such a joke.
[02:17:01.621 --> 02:17:02.502]  It's so hypocritical.
[02:17:03.257 --> 02:17:06.641]  I wonder what his carbon footprint is on his plane, on his boatmobile.
[02:17:06.681 --> 02:17:08.404]  Does he have air conditioning in either one of those?
[02:17:08.924 --> 02:17:11.608]  It is the typical kind of hypocrisy that we see.
[02:17:11.928 --> 02:17:19.057]  And one of the things that he said was, why is it not news when a homeless elderly person dies on the street, but the stock market drops 2%?
[02:17:20.109 --> 02:17:22.310]  Well, we know that's the case, but let me tell you this.
[02:17:22.611 --> 02:17:27.353]  We're going to have a lot of homeless people, a lot of made homeless by the increased taxes.
[02:17:27.554 --> 02:17:33.277]  We're going to have a lot of elderly people who are going to be dying because they don't have heat, because they don't have air conditioning.
[02:17:33.297 --> 02:17:43.243]  We've already seen that happening in places in Germany where they've made such a huge part of the budget for retirees that they can't afford to heat their homes, so they're dying in the cold.
[02:17:43.263 --> 02:17:44.044]  That's what's going to happen.
[02:17:44.284 --> 02:17:48.967]  A billion people will die over a decade if they pass the Copenhagen Treaty.
[02:17:49.881 --> 02:17:53.803]  Which is their treaty they're trying to ram through in part two in December in Paris.
[02:17:54.163 --> 02:17:57.305]  So 2015 is their big move.
[02:17:57.365 --> 02:18:01.447]  I mean, they are going from 50 miles an hour to 5,000 miles an hour, David.
[02:18:01.747 --> 02:18:04.729]  And can you imagine next year it's going to be 20,000 miles an hour.
[02:18:05.089 --> 02:18:07.250]  I mean, they are accelerating at attack speed.
[02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:07.891]  Why do you think that is?
[02:18:08.888 --> 02:18:11.731]  Well, you know, they had the Copenhagen schedule.
[02:18:11.751 --> 02:18:14.894]  They didn't get what they wanted out of that a couple of years ago, so they're putting everything on.
[02:18:14.914 --> 02:18:19.798]  2015, in the fall, from September through December, is the major push.
[02:18:19.838 --> 02:18:21.820]  We knew that when he announced the encyclical.
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:24.162]  We said, wow, he's made this an encyclical.
[02:18:24.182 --> 02:18:32.811]  He's taken a scientist and put him in the Vatican Scientific Advisory Board, someone who has promoted globalist agendas of global government.
[02:18:32.851 --> 02:18:33.291]  He wants a
[02:18:34.592 --> 02:18:35.113]  I don't know.
[02:19:03.294 --> 02:19:07.415]  It's a foreign religious leader with our president lecturing us.
[02:19:07.515 --> 02:19:08.936]  This is outrageous.
[02:19:09.436 --> 02:19:10.976]  This is a slap in everyone's face.
[02:19:11.396 --> 02:19:12.537]  This is disgusting.
[02:19:13.237 --> 02:19:16.978]  And Catholics are really upset, and I know why they are.
[02:19:17.698 --> 02:19:20.359]  If you can, let's pan and show folks the so-called White House.
[02:19:21.299 --> 02:19:24.201]  Fully captured by globalist interest right now.
[02:19:24.241 --> 02:19:30.423]  That's Jakari Jackson doing a great job on camera and we'll hear more from Jakari Jackson tonight and David Knight on the Nightly News.
[02:19:30.684 --> 02:19:32.544]  We're going to break here, David, in 40 seconds.
[02:19:32.885 --> 02:19:34.926]  Tell me what's coming up, what you're going to be working on.
[02:19:35.426 --> 02:19:41.168]  His Lordship, His Grandness, His Excellency, His Supremeness is about to land.
[02:19:41.188 --> 02:19:41.989]  You're about to go cover that?
[02:19:42.819 --> 02:19:44.260]  Yeah, we're going to try to get out there to the base.
[02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:46.801]  I don't know how close we're going to be able to get to Andrews Air Force Base.
[02:19:47.121 --> 02:19:53.424]  CNN was reporting earlier, even though they have a reporter on the plane with the Pope, the CNN reporter said they'd embargoed their equipment.
[02:19:54.185 --> 02:19:58.947]  They were doing a Skype report on CNN because they'd taken all their other satellite equipment from them.
[02:19:59.207 --> 02:20:01.628]  That's how paranoid security is here in this area.
[02:20:01.648 --> 02:20:02.969]  It is absolutely amazing.
[02:20:02.989 --> 02:20:05.490]  Of course, at the moment right now, it's just a bit of a... Hold on!
[02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:06.071]  Skip the break!
[02:20:06.131 --> 02:20:06.571]  Skip the break!
[02:20:07.131 --> 02:20:07.911]  We're going to skip the break.
[02:20:08.171 --> 02:20:10.132]  I'm just going to continue with David Knight because then I want to go to calls.
[02:20:10.772 --> 02:20:13.312]  Absolutely, you're panning around right there.
[02:20:13.472 --> 02:20:18.153]  I've got to stop skipping these breaks, but this is a network break, not a station break, so stations shouldn't be playing over this.
[02:20:19.454 --> 02:20:23.035]  Any other hosts don't do this because they all just, not all of them, a lot of them are just greedy and want money.
[02:20:23.075 --> 02:20:23.995]  I could care less about money.
[02:20:24.055 --> 02:20:26.815]  It's just something to fund the operation to expose the New World Order.
[02:20:27.095 --> 02:20:28.316]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:20:28.336 --> 02:20:32.997]  It's why your support is more important than ever because I don't worry about raising money so much and it is important to do.
[02:20:33.757 --> 02:20:34.017]  David,
[02:20:35.603 --> 02:20:40.766]  Everything with The Globalist is about breaking our will, throwing it in our face, conditioning us to submit.
[02:20:41.186 --> 02:20:52.072]  What do you make of Salon, who criticizes us almost on a daily basis, sometimes daily, usually weekly, making up whole cloth lies, misrepresentations, media matters, all of them.
[02:20:52.513 --> 02:20:54.153]  What do you make of them coming out and
[02:20:55.134 --> 02:20:58.478]  Having an article, I'm a pedophile, but I'm not a monster.
[02:20:58.859 --> 02:21:02.464]  And it's the beginning of, just accept me, it's no big deal.
[02:21:02.824 --> 02:21:06.329]  We knew this was coming now that they've sexualized our children in the schools.
[02:21:06.809 --> 02:21:09.133]  And so now it begins, David Knight.
[02:21:09.153 --> 02:21:10.574]  I mean, there seems to be no end to this.
[02:21:11.434 --> 02:21:16.139]  As we said last night when we covered that, I was covering it with Leanne McAdoo as part of the Nightly News.
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:21.825]  He's talking about sexual orientation and he begins the article by saying, I was born missing one of my hands.
[02:21:21.905 --> 02:21:27.331]  But that was nothing compared to what nature dealt me in terms of my sexual preferences.
[02:21:27.692 --> 02:21:29.113]  Now he talks about how he's celibate.
[02:21:29.434 --> 02:21:31.376]  That's the way they're gradually going to roll it out.
[02:21:31.980 --> 02:21:33.100]  A pity for this guy.
[02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:35.781]  This is something that's just his sexual orientation.
[02:21:35.861 --> 02:21:41.282]  And then it'll be, parents will be on the news proud of them giving their five-year-old to pedophiles.
[02:21:41.342 --> 02:21:44.043]  It'll be, my son Billy has an orientation.
[02:21:44.103 --> 02:21:45.724]  He likes 50-year-old men.
[02:21:45.744 --> 02:21:47.444]  And then they'll just, they'll go, oh!
[02:21:47.724 --> 02:21:50.185]  And then they'll have him on ESPN and go, oh!
[02:21:50.405 --> 02:21:50.985]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:21:51.963 --> 02:22:05.070]  I would be very surprised to see this Pope talking at all about the disintegration of the traditional family here in America, which is basically, that's been the core of their concerns through my entire lifetime, certainly.
[02:22:05.110 --> 02:22:06.411]  That's been the key thing they've talked about.
[02:22:06.691 --> 02:22:12.054]  Talking about keeping the family together, stopping divorce, traditional marriage between a man and a woman, and preventing abortion.
[02:22:12.114 --> 02:22:13.755]  Has he said anything about those things?
[02:22:14.275 --> 02:22:15.096]  I haven't seen anything about it.
[02:22:15.116 --> 02:22:20.479]  No, the first thing he said when he got in a few years ago, the first thing he said was, is Catholics need to stop obsessing on abortion.
[02:22:21.158 --> 02:22:22.719]  Yes, yes, exactly.
[02:22:22.959 --> 02:22:32.642]  And of course there's going to be some people here, there's a back and forth as to whether or not Obama is going to embarrass the Pope by having some gay activists and some transgender people in here.
[02:22:32.902 --> 02:22:37.104]  I don't think there's anything, but he hasn't seemed to be concerned whatsoever about that.
[02:22:37.583 --> 02:22:40.945]  So, it's all about the globalist agenda, Alex.
[02:22:41.185 --> 02:22:48.228]  Whether they're talking about climate change, whether they're talking about open borders, whether they're talking about greed and the marketplace.
[02:22:48.729 --> 02:22:53.251]  And we need to understand that when he talks about this, he's not talking about real free markets.
[02:22:53.491 --> 02:22:55.072]  He's talking about crony capitalism.
[02:22:55.252 --> 02:22:58.193]  He's talking about the kind of economic fascism that they had in Argentina.
[02:22:58.473 --> 02:22:59.814]  That was set up by the Peronistas.
[02:22:59.854 --> 02:23:01.495]  Many people are saying, is he a Marxist?
[02:23:01.775 --> 02:23:02.575]  Is he a fascist?
[02:23:02.635 --> 02:23:03.516]  Is he a Peronista?
[02:23:04.090 --> 02:23:05.293]  It doesn't really matter.
[02:23:05.554 --> 02:23:07.158]  He's a triple agent.
[02:23:07.218 --> 02:23:09.744]  He's sold out capitalist and communist.
[02:23:10.085 --> 02:23:12.190]  He's an inside triple globalist agent.
[02:23:12.841 --> 02:23:14.422]  They're all demagogues, they're all dictators.
[02:23:14.442 --> 02:23:15.783]  He's probably the head of Spectre.
[02:23:16.003 --> 02:23:20.487]  I mean, if I had to say anybody in the world who may be the head of the New World Order, it's Pope Francis.
[02:23:20.927 --> 02:23:23.229]  It's not the Queen of England, it's not David Rockefeller anymore.
[02:23:23.709 --> 02:23:25.411]  I believe he may be the head of the Illuminati.
[02:23:25.871 --> 02:23:34.378]  I believe Pope Francis, everything in his life, I've studied him now, everything he's done, he may be the star chamber leader running every major group.
[02:23:35.410 --> 02:23:41.114]  If you go back and you look at his history, you look at the history of liberation theology, the Jesuits, all these different things.
[02:23:41.354 --> 02:23:43.435]  Everything is breaking tradition.
[02:23:43.855 --> 02:23:46.557]  It's all about breaking tradition within the Catholic Church.
[02:23:46.997 --> 02:23:47.918]  And that's what we're seeing now.
[02:23:47.938 --> 02:23:50.439]  Yeah, they didn't come to defend Jesus or the Catholic Church.
[02:23:50.639 --> 02:23:51.540]  They've overthrown it!
[02:23:52.267 --> 02:23:53.348]  No, no, exactly.
[02:23:53.668 --> 02:23:55.610]  Have you heard him say anything about Jesus?
[02:23:56.011 --> 02:23:58.293]  I'm not really sure we're going to hear anything about that, Alex.
[02:23:58.634 --> 02:23:59.755]  We're going to hear about these other things.
[02:23:59.995 --> 02:24:08.704]  As I've mentioned before, he's going to canonize, make a saint out of a very controversial missionary, famous for abusing the Indians that were there at the time.
[02:24:09.004 --> 02:24:13.549]  And of course, he's even breaking with tradition and saying, you know what, we don't need to have two miracles reported.
[02:24:13.869 --> 02:24:14.550]  We got one
[02:24:15.419 --> 02:24:16.920]  Miracle, kind of, so we're gonna go with that.
[02:24:16.940 --> 02:24:18.622]  We're not gonna wait for the second one, we're just gonna do it.
[02:24:18.642 --> 02:24:22.605]  Why doesn't he make a famous pedophile, you know, canonize a famous pedophile while he's at it?
[02:24:23.465 --> 02:24:23.926]  Give him time.
[02:24:25.049 --> 02:24:27.530]  Well, David Knight, I appreciate you and Jakari.
[02:24:27.870 --> 02:24:35.652]  I would do a man on the street and ask folks what they think about major Democratic publications, basically soft-peddling pedophilia.
[02:24:36.832 --> 02:24:38.433]  What do they think the Pope's going to talk about?
[02:24:38.493 --> 02:24:42.454]  Are they concerned that he wants to put carbon taxes on us that nobody else has to pay?
[02:24:42.474 --> 02:24:44.995]  What do they think his agenda is?
[02:24:45.015 --> 02:24:50.156]  Is it good to have a foreign leader here of a religious group lecturing us and telling us what to do?
[02:24:50.216 --> 02:24:51.537]  I mean, it's just unprecedented.
[02:24:51.797 --> 02:24:52.857]  Thank you so much, David Knight.
[02:24:53.575 --> 02:24:54.095]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:24:54.436 --> 02:24:57.457]  He'll be joining us tomorrow, on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
[02:24:57.757 --> 02:24:58.938]  So will Jakari Jackson.
[02:24:59.238 --> 02:25:00.959]  Jakari's going to be doing Man on the Street and more.
[02:25:01.540 --> 02:25:03.441]  So pray for those guys while they're up there in D.C.
[02:25:03.461 --> 02:25:06.463]  But so much of it, David, is reporting on the security.
[02:25:07.303 --> 02:25:13.687]  I mean, it's like the alien leader has landed, and it's the greatest security ever to make sure nothing happens to him.
[02:25:13.707 --> 02:25:16.028]  Because he's such a good, sweet pope.
[02:25:16.348 --> 02:25:18.370]  Because the liberal media said he was good.
[02:25:18.750 --> 02:25:21.612]  Because they sent in pedophile squads to take over the Catholic Church.
[02:25:22.412 --> 02:25:23.312]  And they've taken it over.
[02:25:23.613 --> 02:25:25.694]  Whether it was good or bad before, it's bad now.
[02:25:26.274 --> 02:25:27.715]  And, man, get ready.
[02:25:28.575 --> 02:25:29.716]  Because they're coming.
[02:25:30.296 --> 02:25:30.936]  For our kids.
[02:25:31.736 --> 02:25:36.119]  If they can't kill them in the womb, they're going to hand them over to Potbelly Pedophile.
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:43.122]  Augusta, in Alabama, thanks for holding your atropia on the year.
[02:25:48.297 --> 02:25:52.699]  Augusta's been a real tripper, so we're going to let them sit there and wait until they hear that they're actually on the line to go to us.
[02:25:52.719 --> 02:25:54.040]  They're probably listening on a delay.
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:55.320]  Augusta, do you hear us?
[02:25:56.981 --> 02:25:59.522]  We're going to put them on hold until they come back.
[02:26:00.102 --> 02:26:00.542]  Mama!
[02:26:01.483 --> 02:26:02.523]  Mama in Oregon.
[02:26:02.623 --> 02:26:03.904]  Oh, I say the word mama.
[02:26:03.964 --> 02:26:05.765]  Some people don't have a mama at home.
[02:26:06.025 --> 02:26:06.685]  That's hateful.
[02:26:07.025 --> 02:26:08.046]  So let's just call her.
[02:26:09.426 --> 02:26:14.030]  Hello Alex, I had to call in today when I saw you, you know, actually felt your energy and I saw you get, you know, just upset
[02:26:39.130 --> 02:26:41.791]  About what's going on, and I'm the same way.
[02:26:41.891 --> 02:26:47.074]  I get upset, but also I wanted to call in on the topic of pedophilia.
[02:26:47.854 --> 02:26:51.716]  Because... Now don't you be, don't you be sexist or racist here.
[02:26:51.956 --> 02:26:53.177]  They have a right to your children.
[02:26:53.197 --> 02:26:54.978]  I mean the liberal media says so.
[02:26:54.998 --> 02:26:55.538]  Oh no they don't!
[02:26:55.658 --> 02:26:57.319]  Those pedophilias are monsters!
[02:26:57.439 --> 02:26:57.819]  Hater!
[02:26:57.979 --> 02:26:58.279]  Hater!
[02:26:58.459 --> 02:26:58.740]  Hater!
[02:26:58.880 --> 02:26:59.220]  Racist!
[02:26:59.320 --> 02:26:59.740]  Racist!
[02:26:59.780 --> 02:27:00.100]  Racist!
[02:27:00.300 --> 02:27:00.581]  Hater!
[02:27:00.601 --> 02:27:00.761]  Hater!
[02:27:00.781 --> 02:27:01.001]  Hater!
[02:27:01.021 --> 02:27:01.161]  Hater!
[02:27:01.221 --> 02:27:01.481]  Hater!
[02:27:01.561 --> 02:27:01.921]  Sorry!
[02:27:02.201 --> 02:27:03.202]  I was a victim of pedophilia.
[02:27:03.922 --> 02:27:05.503]  And it almost ruined my life.
[02:27:06.098 --> 02:27:07.799]  Okay, it almost ruined me.
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:09.400]  Almost ruined my life.
[02:27:09.601 --> 02:27:10.881]  I was able to come back.
[02:27:10.902 --> 02:27:13.223]  Alright, well I shouldn't have been sarcastic with you.
[02:27:13.483 --> 02:27:15.004]  It's the most abominable thing there is.
[02:27:15.024 --> 02:27:16.506]  I appreciate you having the courage to talk about it.
[02:27:16.826 --> 02:27:18.427]  I didn't know you were a victim of these demons.
[02:27:18.887 --> 02:27:19.908]  Committed another thought crime.
[02:27:20.168 --> 02:27:20.809]  These trendies.
[02:27:21.529 --> 02:27:22.450]  Tell us what happened to you.
[02:27:24.491 --> 02:27:28.834]  My mother married a pedophile.
[02:27:30.015 --> 02:27:35.059]  And he molested me and my cousin.
[02:27:36.304 --> 02:27:38.265]  And other members of my family.
[02:27:40.267 --> 02:27:43.469]  And he is still walking around in the town I live in.
[02:27:45.630 --> 02:27:49.673]  You know, but I don't live with the hate for that person.
[02:27:50.613 --> 02:28:02.821]  I live with the... I live with a huge survivor-type energy, okay?
[02:28:03.562 --> 02:28:08.164]  I was able to come back from severe depression, anxiety.
[02:28:08.184 --> 02:28:11.046]  You were able to transcend this guy?
[02:28:11.086 --> 02:28:11.646]  Well, that's good.
[02:28:13.627 --> 02:28:19.771]  You know, I see him walking around knowing that he's probably preying on other people.
[02:28:20.891 --> 02:28:21.231]  You know?
[02:28:21.251 --> 02:28:22.892]  I hope he doesn't fall down the stairs.
[02:28:22.912 --> 02:28:23.212]  Well, yeah.
[02:28:26.823 --> 02:28:32.128]  But, you know, these pedophiles make praise out of children and innocents.
[02:28:32.969 --> 02:28:33.890]  They are murderers.
[02:28:34.390 --> 02:28:35.191]  They're killers.
[02:28:35.672 --> 02:28:36.592]  They're ruiners.
[02:28:37.373 --> 02:28:38.394]  They're predators.
[02:28:38.895 --> 02:28:40.136]  And they are cowards.
[02:28:40.897 --> 02:28:41.537]  They're liars.
[02:28:41.557 --> 02:28:43.099]  Well, not according to liberal trendies.
[02:28:43.799 --> 02:28:46.582]  They believe it's a sexual preference and that this is something they should be able to do.
[02:28:48.824 --> 02:28:49.365]  Yeah, well...
[02:28:50.325 --> 02:28:56.168]  You know, if I considered everybody's opinion like that, I wouldn't know myself.
[02:28:56.188 --> 02:28:56.989]  No, I hear you.
[02:28:57.189 --> 02:28:58.870]  Listen, they are super depraved.
[02:28:59.290 --> 02:29:00.270]  They've done everything.
[02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:05.573]  So their new religion is being able to do things like this and go after people.
[02:29:05.873 --> 02:29:08.575]  And guys, I just banged the table and lost my audio.
[02:29:09.637 --> 02:29:12.500]  I just caught some kind of weird short and I barely banged it.
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:14.381]  Probably all the earlier banging.
[02:29:14.802 --> 02:29:15.803]  Maybe I'll get another headset.
[02:29:15.823 --> 02:29:17.684]  Man, I'm going to put you on hold and let you finish after the break.
[02:29:18.005 --> 02:29:18.565]  Mama, stay there.
[02:29:18.585 --> 02:29:21.848]  I want you to be able to finish your story, but I've lost audio in here.
[02:29:21.868 --> 02:29:30.155]  I could probably just plug into one of their plugs over there, but I was banging it a little bit too hard earlier and I may have just gone a little too far.
[02:29:30.916 --> 02:29:32.257]  Uh, here, uh, doing that.
[02:29:32.577 --> 02:29:39.060]  We're gonna go to break, come back, finish up, uh, no, no, not, yeah, yeah, Mama, then Augusta, then AD, then Dave, then Frank.
[02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:43.142]  That'll be it for calls after those five, six callers, because I need to hit the other news.
[02:29:43.202 --> 02:29:46.003]  But this, this, this perverted stuff isn't just in the Catholic Church.
[02:29:46.343 --> 02:29:50.005]  Report British Prime Minister David Cameron stuck his genitals in a dead pig's mouth.
[02:29:50.865 --> 02:29:53.967]  It's not very nice to put in your genitals in Hillary Clinton's mouth, David Cameron.
[02:29:54.187 --> 02:29:54.667]  We'll be back.
[02:29:54.687 --> 02:29:55.748]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[02:29:59.289 --> 02:30:02.275]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.217 --> 02:30:05.922]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.006 --> 02:30:15.849]  Over the weekend, Cheryl Atkinson released the following article, What the News Isn't Saying About Vaccine Autism Studies.
[02:30:16.129 --> 02:30:21.312]  She starts off with a New England Journal of Medicine study that says there is no link between vaccines and autism.
[02:30:21.492 --> 02:30:26.695]  She then discloses the consulting firm behind the study, the Lewin Group, lists major vaccine makers among its clients.
[02:30:26.895 --> 02:30:31.257]  In fact, the Lewin Group's parent company, United Health Group, is a key government partner in Obamacare.
[02:30:31.417 --> 02:30:36.398]  And a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, QSSI, was given the contract to build the Obamacare website.
[02:30:36.558 --> 02:30:50.061]  She then looks at the AstroTurf propaganda campaign and some of the buzzwords they use, like weak, too small, haphazard, not replicated, junk science, flawed, unrelated, and how these words are used over and over again to attack anybody who questions the vaccine mafia.
[02:30:50.221 --> 02:30:55.362]  She then covers over 13 different studies that show a correlation between vaccine intake and brain damage.
[02:30:55.642 --> 02:31:01.063]  In fact, permanent brain damage is an acknowledged rare side effect of vaccines, and there's no dispute in that arena.
[02:31:01.203 --> 02:31:06.387]  So the next time your herd mentality friends are pushing vaccine propaganda in your face, shove this back in theirs.
[02:31:06.567 --> 02:31:09.349]  Rob Dew for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:31:09.870 --> 02:31:13.672]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[02:31:13.953 --> 02:31:24.281]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[02:31:24.421 --> 02:31:27.343]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[02:31:27.483 --> 02:31:36.246]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[02:31:36.286 --> 02:31:38.027]  This is the good halogen.
[02:31:38.127 --> 02:31:40.888]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[02:31:41.188 --> 02:31:52.972]  Now we at InfoWarsLife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure, 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:31:53.212 --> 02:31:54.473]  Watch the informational videos

[02:33:19.948 --> 02:33:20.488]  to 2 p.m.
[02:33:20.548 --> 02:33:21.809]  Central, we're live.
[02:33:21.829 --> 02:33:23.611]  Back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:33:23.891 --> 02:33:25.332]  InfoWars, nightly news.
[02:33:25.432 --> 02:33:29.255]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:29.295 --> 02:33:29.776]  Yes!
[02:33:30.396 --> 02:33:35.140]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.921 --> 02:33:36.661]  Revolution!
[02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:39.920]  And not the type being pushed by Obama.
[02:33:40.561 --> 02:33:41.041]  Or the poop.
[02:33:42.001 --> 02:33:42.781]  Excuse me, the Pope.
[02:33:47.662 --> 02:33:48.703]  Revolution!
[02:33:49.643 --> 02:33:52.864]  All these cowards like to act like they're revolutionaries.
[02:33:53.404 --> 02:33:54.124]  They're trendies.
[02:33:54.584 --> 02:33:57.985]  And they join with the establishment in pushing its fraud.
[02:33:59.265 --> 02:34:03.406]  The only real revolution is promoting human independence and free will.
[02:34:04.266 --> 02:34:06.407]  And anyone that stands against that is a fraud.
[02:34:07.887 --> 02:34:09.829]  Anyone that stands against that is a joke.
[02:34:10.610 --> 02:34:11.130]  Crank it up!
[02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:39.362]  And love comes pouring through!
[02:34:39.742 --> 02:34:40.423]  Yeah!
[02:34:45.206 --> 02:34:58.237]  All these evil people that they're going to bring in some Helter Skelter race war.
[02:34:59.898 --> 02:35:01.839]  All they're going to do is bring in their own destruction.
[02:35:04.121 --> 02:35:05.022]  They picked the loser.
[02:35:06.687 --> 02:35:07.768]  Not the winning team.
[02:35:09.510 --> 02:35:14.475]  But the illusion makes you think the loser is gonna win.
[02:35:14.515 --> 02:35:15.196]  No, my friends.
[02:35:19.380 --> 02:35:23.224]  Yes, will the world continue to live in the shadow of atomic fear?
[02:35:25.166 --> 02:35:26.167]  And will we disappear?
[02:35:29.348 --> 02:35:29.689]  U.S.
[02:35:29.749 --> 02:35:41.582]  will station new nuclear weapons in East Germany against Russia and moving more brigades of troops in to, quote, train the Ukrainian opposition forces.
[02:35:43.043 --> 02:35:45.446]  Meanwhile, it was going to be just four fighter jets at one base.
[02:35:45.526 --> 02:35:47.669]  Now it's 28 combat planes in Syria.
[02:35:49.557 --> 02:35:53.238]  As air raids are run against Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Western-run forces.
[02:35:54.298 --> 02:35:58.739]  Caught on video, black teen punches racist bus driver in the face for demanding a fare.
[02:35:58.759 --> 02:36:03.681]  I'm going to play some of that coming up because it just illustrates how they've created total divide and conquer.
[02:36:03.701 --> 02:36:11.783]  The judge has come out and said the Clock Kid family could be charged with fraud if incident is proven purposeful hoax.
[02:36:12.903 --> 02:36:16.964]  Gee, he just came with something that looks like a classic suitcase bomb.
[02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:23.747]  And then wouldn't respond and say it was a clock or anything to create hype and the White House was waiting.
[02:36:24.308 --> 02:36:27.133]  I smell a big, giant, stinking rat sandwich.
[02:36:27.754 --> 02:36:31.821]  I don't know what you smell, but you'd have to be a moron not to see through this.
[02:36:34.065 --> 02:36:36.906]  I hate agreeing with Bill Maher, but he says the same thing.
[02:36:37.287 --> 02:36:38.107]  I meant to play that yesterday.
[02:36:38.127 --> 02:36:38.867]  Can we cue that up?
[02:36:39.248 --> 02:36:40.208]  Because I want to play that in a little while.
[02:36:40.228 --> 02:36:40.788]  Thank you, guys.
[02:36:41.029 --> 02:36:42.089]  What a wonderful crew we've got.
[02:36:42.449 --> 02:36:43.510]  Mama, I apologize.
[02:36:43.550 --> 02:36:48.252]  I was banging the desk so much that it unhooked wires up underneath the table that went to the power supply.
[02:36:48.272 --> 02:36:55.116]  So I've got to really stop attacking the table here when I have fantasies about punching pedophiles and breaking their jaws.
[02:36:55.956 --> 02:37:08.427]  I'm sorry, I literally, literally am like an insane bull in a pen having a cattle prod shoved into it when I hear these people talking about, your kids belong to the state, and by the way, we're going to do things to them.
[02:37:08.767 --> 02:37:10.889]  I mean, it's just, it's total domination.
[02:37:11.189 --> 02:37:13.051]  Your women and children belong to us!
[02:37:13.231 --> 02:37:19.036]  Because we have pot bellies, and little chicken necks, and lecture you, and we run the universities!
[02:37:20.217 --> 02:37:22.057]  I'll get you and your little dog, too!
[02:37:22.077 --> 02:37:24.778]  Wait till I dump a gallon of water on you!
[02:37:25.018 --> 02:37:25.878]  I'm melting!
[02:37:25.978 --> 02:37:26.559]  I'm melting!
[02:37:26.699 --> 02:37:27.599]  What a world!
[02:37:27.679 --> 02:37:28.559]  What a world!
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:31.220]  Excuse me.
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:33.680]  Mama, I'm sorry to hear that you got abused.
[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:35.101]  You got cut off.
[02:37:35.121 --> 02:37:35.941]  Go ahead and finish your point.
[02:37:38.041 --> 02:37:40.982]  Yeah, I appreciate that, Alex.
[02:37:41.002 --> 02:37:44.523]  And I love that you banged your table so hard.
[02:37:46.683 --> 02:37:48.984]  But, you know, these pedophiles
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:53.963]  They don't see their prey as children or innocent.
[02:37:53.983 --> 02:38:01.789]  They only see a piece of meat, you know, that they want to devour entirely.
[02:38:01.849 --> 02:38:06.232]  They know nothing or care nothing of real life or real love.
[02:38:06.572 --> 02:38:06.913]  Okay.
[02:38:08.974 --> 02:38:15.179]  Um, also the, uh, the pedophile promoter puppet Pope, he should be in jail.
[02:38:15.299 --> 02:38:18.722]  He has an arrest warrant out for him.
[02:38:19.852 --> 02:38:27.724]  Uh, through the international courts that have found him guilty of crimes against children and people.
[02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:33.732]  Well, absolutely.
[02:38:33.772 --> 02:38:51.629]  Throughout history, every time a civilization falls, which is not normal, but it shows up over time in every civilization, that PBPs, pot-bellied pedophiles, show up and what they want to do is abuse children, they want to sacrifice them, they want to torture them, they want to rape them, and they want the energy of the child.
[02:38:52.910 --> 02:38:56.574]  And it just arrives every time, and now they're going to sell it as a right
[02:38:58.325 --> 02:38:59.086]  And a great honor.
[02:38:59.726 --> 02:39:04.171]  And now we're going to hear the announcements of how great pedophilia is and bestiality and everything else.
[02:39:05.092 --> 02:39:09.436]  And again, it's not just that they're going to have sex with their donkey or whatever at their house.
[02:39:09.937 --> 02:39:10.537]  Poor donkey.
[02:39:11.423 --> 02:39:12.843]  It's that they're going to push it on us.
[02:39:12.923 --> 02:39:16.765]  See, it's about making us... You're like, I'm unattracted to a donkey.
[02:39:17.065 --> 02:39:17.945]  Well, we don't care.
[02:39:18.085 --> 02:39:20.105]  You're not trendy if you don't let us teach your kids about it.
[02:39:20.926 --> 02:39:30.268]  Because if they can teach you about bestiality, which is now being promoted, then anything... I mean, it's like the National Post a few months ago in Canada, the big national paper, and I appreciate your call, ma'am.
[02:39:30.848 --> 02:39:35.370]  They came out and they said the trans-abled chop their arms and legs off.
[02:39:35.390 --> 02:39:36.010]  It's very beautiful.
[02:39:36.883 --> 02:39:38.545]  I would tell people about this and they didn't believe it.
[02:39:38.905 --> 02:39:49.496]  But now they want the state to pay for you having your arms and legs chopped off, and then your own welfare, and you're tended to by the state, and then other people come by that torture you.
[02:39:49.536 --> 02:39:53.039]  There's different fetishes, but I knew about this over a decade ago.
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:57.844]  And then you're tortured, and you like to live in a box and wear a diaper, and you're tortured.
[02:39:57.884 --> 02:40:00.607]  I'm sorry to talk about this, but your children are now being taught.
[02:40:01.448 --> 02:40:09.075]  And then they're going to have, basically, in the future, little baby carriages that the school has in the special ed area.
[02:40:09.095 --> 02:40:13.800]  And they'll wheelchair around the kids that have had their arms and legs cut off, because that's part of the culture.
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:18.445]  And mommy and daddy, I feel like I want my arms and legs cut off, because that's what they'll be taught in school.
[02:40:18.725 --> 02:40:20.406]  And they'll go and have their arms and legs cut off.
[02:40:21.047 --> 02:40:35.152]  And then they'll also be the kids at school that have their potbelly pedophile mentor that'll take them off to a nice facility where a bunch of old men will hang over your daughter or your son and that'll be a good thing.
[02:40:35.172 --> 02:40:36.892]  And if you don't like it, SWAT teams are standing by.
[02:40:36.913 --> 02:40:41.734]  And you're going to drink fluoride, you're going to take forced inoculations, and you're going to die!
[02:40:41.754 --> 02:40:49.737]  And there's just going to be people dying everywhere just frolicking in Satanism and giant PBP command bases everywhere feeding on our children.
[02:40:52.458 --> 02:40:53.719]  So PVPs are taking over.
[02:40:54.379 --> 02:40:55.500]  And I'm not even being sarcastic!
[02:40:55.700 --> 02:41:09.130]  Black boxes and everything, taxing you, scamming you, gang raping you, chemtrailing, geoengineering, atomic testing in the upper atmosphere, total insane asylums, mass drugging of populations, just... This is what evil is!
[02:41:10.011 --> 02:41:12.233]  Welcome to Planet New World Order, baby!
[02:41:13.474 --> 02:41:16.356]  And see, I'm not crazy, I'm in the enemy's mind.
[02:41:18.874 --> 02:41:19.334]  I know them.
[02:41:20.515 --> 02:41:25.417]  Look, when they announced 10,000 refugees last week, I said it'll be a couple hundred thousand in the next few weeks.
[02:41:25.497 --> 02:41:25.757]  Now it's 300,000.
[02:41:25.917 --> 02:41:30.459]  And I'm not bragging, I'm saying I know how they operate, okay?
[02:41:32.711 --> 02:41:37.094]  I mean, Hillary Clinton, from our deepest research, likes to dominatrix women.
[02:41:37.314 --> 02:41:38.234]  Well, that's grown women.
[02:41:38.254 --> 02:41:39.775]  I mean, that's her issue.
[02:41:39.815 --> 02:41:40.836]  I'm not attacking her for that.
[02:41:41.676 --> 02:41:45.779]  Her wanting to take Haitian children's money for her private jets is wrong.
[02:41:46.199 --> 02:41:47.460]  Her wanting my guns is wrong.
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:49.521]  Her wanting to shut off our power plants is wrong.
[02:41:49.801 --> 02:41:51.182]  Bill Clinton, though, crosses the line.
[02:41:51.202 --> 02:41:52.103]  He likes to rape women.
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:54.701]  And I don't like guys that rape women.
[02:41:55.101 --> 02:41:56.762]  Because they like to rape other people too.
[02:41:57.302 --> 02:41:58.322]  They like to dominate.
[02:41:58.342 --> 02:42:00.263]  You know, that's how you can tell Gore Vidal had a screw loose.
[02:42:01.043 --> 02:42:04.025]  Because he wrote in books, I've read some, he's a very smart guy, he's been on the show.
[02:42:04.045 --> 02:42:06.166]  Before he died, he was a listener.
[02:42:07.886 --> 02:42:10.367]  But he said all sex is about power and domination.
[02:42:10.587 --> 02:42:14.189]  And he wrote books, you know, about trainees raping men.
[02:42:14.309 --> 02:42:17.510]  And, you know, you know what, Gore Vidal, something's wrong with you.
[02:42:17.931 --> 02:42:20.032]  I bet money he was abused or something as a child.
[02:42:20.072 --> 02:42:20.672]  That's my opinion.
[02:42:21.414 --> 02:42:22.836]  Because it's not what sex is about.
[02:42:22.876 --> 02:42:23.796]  It's not about power.
[02:42:25.738 --> 02:42:29.002]  And if you think sex is all about power, then something's wrong with you.
[02:42:32.726 --> 02:42:34.588]  And see, that's where the divide happens here.
[02:42:35.068 --> 02:42:38.472]  There's people that want to empower humans, there's people who want to dominate humans.
[02:42:38.512 --> 02:42:40.354]  Well, I'm in the camp that wants to dominate
[02:42:41.209 --> 02:42:41.769]  The tyrants.
[02:42:42.750 --> 02:42:45.152]  I don't want to dominate the innocents.
[02:42:45.752 --> 02:42:52.936]  The problem is the average person who's in the camp of wanting to have free will, will not dominate the tyrants.
[02:42:53.177 --> 02:42:54.417]  And so they get dominated.
[02:42:55.518 --> 02:42:56.739]  And so that's the paradox.
[02:42:57.119 --> 02:43:05.645]  Those of us that are for free will, are for empowering, but are in the camp of wanting to dominate the tyrants, are few and far between.
[02:43:06.536 --> 02:43:14.098]  And that's why the enemy has set up the screens and systems in the culture to try to dominate us before we get off the ground.
[02:43:17.139 --> 02:43:18.320]  So decide which camp you're in.
[02:43:18.420 --> 02:43:22.581]  Are you in the camp that likes to empower people, or are you in the camp that likes to dominate people?
[02:43:24.401 --> 02:43:29.083]  And that's where the paradox is of the sheepdog, which I didn't get from American Sniper, folks.
[02:43:37.418 --> 02:43:40.680]  You're not a wolf, you don't want to feed on people, but you're not a sheep.
[02:43:41.240 --> 02:43:41.921]  You're a sheepdog.
[02:43:42.641 --> 02:43:48.004]  You're someone who's in the pro-human camp, but you're not someone that's going to be pushed over and enslaved.
[02:43:50.085 --> 02:43:55.769]  And they trained the sheepdogs how to submit to tyranny and to not want to dominate the wolf.
[02:44:00.892 --> 02:44:07.837]  And where are people's instincts when they see a group of bullies picking on an old lady, picking on a young person, wanting to do something against them?
[02:44:08.157 --> 02:44:12.500]  And then they try to get the sheepdogs in their whole anti-bullying campaign to end free speech.
[02:44:13.961 --> 02:44:16.623]  When nobody's more bullying and controlling than the left.
[02:44:18.032 --> 02:44:20.354]  So I'm not in the camp of submitting to tyranny.
[02:44:20.614 --> 02:44:22.535]  I'm not in the camp of wanting to tyrannize people.
[02:44:22.895 --> 02:44:28.059]  I'm in the camp of wanting to empower humanity and to absolutely stomp tyrants into the ground.
[02:44:28.699 --> 02:44:31.841]  And so, all of you, I beg you to hit your knees tonight.
[02:44:32.281 --> 02:44:33.042]  Hit rock bottom.
[02:44:33.442 --> 02:44:34.983]  I know I hit rock bottom all the time.
[02:44:35.343 --> 02:44:47.071]  It's good to humble yourself and ask God, get me back on the straight and narrow, help me be strong, give me the discernment I need to understand what's happening, and then give me the spirit it takes to not want to lay down to these tyrants.
[02:44:47.471 --> 02:44:49.172]  Because believe me, it's an animating spirit.
[02:44:51.654 --> 02:44:57.698]  The average person I don't think can handle being a good person because the responsibility that comes with it is so empowering.
[02:44:59.508 --> 02:45:00.809]  And most people are dead inside.
[02:45:01.049 --> 02:45:02.950]  They sleep while the Illuminati live.
[02:45:04.631 --> 02:45:04.891]  A.D.
[02:45:04.931 --> 02:45:06.591]  in Delaware, thanks for holding your own here.
[02:45:08.813 --> 02:45:11.534]  Thanks, Alex, so much for this show today, man.
[02:45:11.574 --> 02:45:15.216]  I'll tell you, this is the Pandora's box opening.
[02:45:15.556 --> 02:45:24.120]  You know, when Henry Vincent came out with that book, that was the blood dripping on the floor that's going to bring about Hellraiser.
[02:45:24.540 --> 02:45:47.641]  I mean, in my opinion, I mean, I shake with anger when I think about this, but when you think about Herbert Walker Bush, Cheney, George Bush, Barney Frank being in the same building, Operation Brown Star, raping children, orphans, this man has documented this stuff, and then you're looking at 411 Vanish, where people go to Yellowstone
[02:45:48.161 --> 02:45:49.582]  Yes, it's pretty evil.
[02:46:06.158 --> 02:46:15.442]  It is beyond the scope of humanity to think that these people walk around in pajamas with their solid gold staff and whatever.
[02:46:15.663 --> 02:46:16.303]  What do they think we've got?
[02:46:16.323 --> 02:46:17.203]  A pote-mobile.
[02:46:17.543 --> 02:46:21.185]  Listen, we've heard decades of rape coming out of the Vatican.
[02:46:21.425 --> 02:46:24.347]  The Vatican's got 30 trillion dollars of our money.
[02:46:24.427 --> 02:46:26.848]  Everybody, Geithner and everyone puts their money over there.
[02:46:27.268 --> 02:46:31.370]  The bottom line is, I want people to understand that this is to czarian,
[02:46:32.350 --> 02:46:43.714]  Zionist mafia at the top, the umbra, the deepest, darkest, the worst evil on the planet who have had six, seven, eight heart transplants.
[02:46:43.734 --> 02:46:45.214]  We don't even know how old they are.
[02:46:45.974 --> 02:46:47.355]  But this is the one, Alex.
[02:46:47.415 --> 02:46:49.055]  This is the clash of the titans.
[02:46:49.375 --> 02:46:50.556]  They called our return.
[02:46:50.896 --> 02:46:52.696]  You know, I talk to troops.
[02:46:53.557 --> 02:46:54.977]  I don't talk to too many police.
[02:46:55.937 --> 02:46:56.918]  Man, let me tell you something.
[02:46:56.938 --> 02:47:01.119]  These guys, these kids, they are bent.
[02:47:01.801 --> 02:47:11.026]  They're so broken, they can't even remember what... I'm telling you, Alex, they gave him opium dope, they gave him narrow... I know, I hear you, I appreciate your call.
[02:47:11.406 --> 02:47:20.290]  My whole issue is, I don't want to make this about Catholics or Protestants or Jews, it's evil people at the tops of major organizations promoting bad things.
[02:47:22.451 --> 02:47:23.732]  But it is very, very frightening.
[02:47:23.772 --> 02:47:27.074]  Joe Bix is on record, he was in Esquire, he was in
[02:47:28.516 --> 02:47:33.479]  Rolling Stone, he was, you know, off and on for three years, had Michael Hastings embedded with him.
[02:47:33.659 --> 02:47:37.941]  He was in longer than that, but for three years, Hastings was embedded and wrote about it because he was in a combat unit.
[02:47:39.822 --> 02:47:44.725]  And Joe said they would order him as a staff sergeant, and they would have Russians deliver it.
[02:47:44.765 --> 02:47:45.865]  People go, that's not true.
[02:47:45.905 --> 02:47:48.246]  Look, Russians deliver supplies to Afghanistan.
[02:47:48.266 --> 02:47:49.687]  They just stopped it two weeks ago.
[02:47:50.087 --> 02:47:56.271]  They had a 10-year contract where they were delivering the supplies as ordered via Hind helicopters, under helicopters, to the troops.
[02:47:57.412 --> 02:48:03.200]  And he said Russian helicopters would land in it and they would be ordered to take opiums to prime them to get them on heroin later.
[02:48:04.361 --> 02:48:12.192]  And they had army psychologists and psychiatrists that would make them take, you know, the most powerful pills and order them to take it until they got addicted.
[02:48:13.533 --> 02:48:23.818]  And then they would basically then try to declare him unfit to own guns once they got out, or they would then take away the opiates and a bunch of his unit would then go get on heroin that's right next to it.
[02:48:24.138 --> 02:48:29.600]  Oh sorry, for a year we put you on pain pills and you got another year to stay here, we're taking the pain pills away.
[02:48:29.860 --> 02:48:31.301]  I mean, it's not even hidden.
[02:48:31.921 --> 02:48:33.322]  You talk about a major scandal.
[02:48:36.303 --> 02:48:37.163]  And that's what they did.
[02:48:37.343 --> 02:48:38.004]  And you know, my
[02:48:39.264 --> 02:48:44.485]  Mom's brother who died last year was a helicopter pilot in Vietnam.
[02:48:45.946 --> 02:48:48.346]  And he wouldn't talk about all the classified stuff that went on.
[02:48:48.366 --> 02:48:50.987]  I'm not even going to get into it either because I was told so by a family.
[02:48:52.307 --> 02:48:54.248]  And it's just so corrupt.
[02:48:57.709 --> 02:48:58.969]  So incredibly corrupt.
[02:49:03.306 --> 02:49:05.786]  And just the public is so naive and has no idea.
[02:49:06.687 --> 02:49:11.047]  But our troops were sent over there out of all the reasons to addict them to heroin.
[02:49:15.588 --> 02:49:16.308]  It's so evil.
[02:49:17.089 --> 02:49:29.511]  And yeah, I meet the young troops now, the special forces guys that are out, and I mean, they're either totally awake and know what's going on, and have health problems from what the injections and the rest of it, or they are whacked out of their minds.
[02:49:30.751 --> 02:49:32.833]  And I'll say, let me guess, they put you on opiates.
[02:49:32.893 --> 02:49:33.934]  Yeah, they ordered us to take them.
[02:49:34.674 --> 02:49:35.955]  And so now you're on drugs.
[02:49:36.115 --> 02:49:39.118]  You know, they are just soft killing them left and right.
[02:49:41.140 --> 02:49:42.421]  David, Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:49:42.461 --> 02:49:43.682]  Go ahead, we got about a minute and a half.
[02:49:44.775 --> 02:49:46.697]  Thank you very much for having me, Alex.
[02:49:47.318 --> 02:49:51.683]  My original topic was going back to what Diamond and Silk were talking about regarding Trump.
[02:49:51.803 --> 02:50:00.592]  I just wanted to touch upon that briefly, but listening to the conversations that you've been having just in the last hour from the other callers, I feel compelled to address those as well.
[02:50:01.173 --> 02:50:02.294]  Just briefly on Trump.
[02:50:03.155 --> 02:50:14.461]  There is actually a track record, well prior to his running for the presidential seat, as far as his track record for caring for the American people.
[02:50:14.501 --> 02:50:30.849]  He had a program called Trump University, and the focus of that program was financial literacy, to be able to allow the American people to be able to understand... I know, and he went after Obama on the legitimacy issue, and he did fight some of that stuff, yeah.
[02:50:32.233 --> 02:50:39.641]  Yeah, I want to touch upon that, and also just briefly on the success of his projects as a businessman.
[02:50:40.081 --> 02:50:42.804]  Yes, he's had his failures, but he also has a track record of overcoming them.
[02:50:42.824 --> 02:50:54.657]  Well, I mean, look, look, when they say he's declared bankruptcy four times, owning 100 plus subsidiaries, when a business goes under, that's what you do is you have a corporation for that business, so if it fails, you just shut it down.
[02:50:55.097 --> 02:51:00.542]  So, again, they are preying on ignorance when they say he's a failure because he's declared bankruptcy four times.
[02:51:01.023 --> 02:51:03.485]  That's what you're supposed to do with a new venture.
[02:51:03.826 --> 02:51:06.328]  If it fails, you don't connect it to your other stuff.
[02:51:06.768 --> 02:51:07.549]  So, absolutely.
[02:51:07.589 --> 02:51:08.290]  Good points, Dave.
[02:51:08.570 --> 02:51:08.951]  We'll be back.
[02:51:09.875 --> 02:51:11.698]  Who's among the worst at keeping your data private?
[02:51:11.838 --> 02:51:15.303]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy Report says it's AT&T.

[02:54:24.057 --> 02:54:26.662]  Salon.com is the vampire.
[02:54:37.981 --> 02:54:39.421]  They're the liberal authorities.
[02:54:39.981 --> 02:54:41.102]  They tell us how to think.
[02:54:41.702 --> 02:54:42.742]  Thank you, Salon.
[02:54:43.302 --> 02:54:46.003]  No thanks on endorsing pedophilia and embracing it.
[02:54:46.963 --> 02:54:48.823]  I know, though, you've got the kids in schools.
[02:54:49.083 --> 02:54:50.063]  They'll learn, won't they?
[02:54:51.244 --> 02:54:58.925]  Just like the Violence Policy Center one time was quoted in the paper saying, we don't care if Jones caught bribery at the Statehouse and blew all these bills sky-high.
[02:54:59.745 --> 02:55:02.246]  They said, we got your kids in public education.
[02:55:04.377 --> 02:55:04.877]  That was a quote.
[02:55:04.917 --> 02:55:05.818]  We got your kids.
[02:55:06.198 --> 02:55:08.699]  Just the arrogance of this filth will be their undoing.
[02:55:08.719 --> 02:55:11.540]  I want to jam in a few more calls.
[02:55:12.180 --> 02:55:19.243]  Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting with 4th Hour from Her Britannic Majesty's command base over in London.
[02:55:19.263 --> 02:55:24.125]  A new article and video is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:55:24.165 --> 02:55:30.748]  Kit Daniels reports, man debunks clock kid by recreating Ahmed's clock in 20 seconds.
[02:55:31.468 --> 02:55:32.668]  It was the guts of a 1979
[02:55:35.151 --> 02:55:35.911]  Digital clock.
[02:55:36.331 --> 02:55:38.692]  Put in there to, well, we know what to do.
[02:55:38.712 --> 02:55:44.353]  So you can be the big, wonderful, delicate genius over there at the White House with Obama.
[02:55:45.653 --> 02:55:46.353]  Have a stunt.
[02:55:47.673 --> 02:55:50.174]  Turkey responsible for flood of illegal immigrants in Europe.
[02:55:51.174 --> 02:55:54.294]  Europe, Germans media covering up rapes committed by Muslim migrants.
[02:55:54.314 --> 02:55:56.675]  They're going to cover up the PBP's operations as well.
[02:55:59.935 --> 02:56:01.876]  That's just some of the news up on Infowars.com.
[02:56:03.872 --> 02:56:14.895]  Before I jam in a few final calls here, before the fourth hour, briefly, Survival Shield Ancient Iodine X2 Deep Earth Crystal Source is the cleanest purest iodine you're going to find.
[02:56:15.295 --> 02:56:18.336]  It turns bright blue on paper, not red, because that's what real crystals are.
[02:56:18.376 --> 02:56:19.096]  They're purple blue.
[02:56:19.896 --> 02:56:22.357]  And what it does in the body is it goes through and just grabs toxins.
[02:56:22.417 --> 02:56:24.717]  It fills your different glands like a thyroid.
[02:56:25.937 --> 02:56:29.078]  The good halogens, the bad halogen fluoride, other stuff can't get in there.
[02:56:29.238 --> 02:56:31.799]  Go read the reviews at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:56:34.192 --> 02:56:34.873]  Our call toll is 3-888-253-3139.
[02:56:54.614 --> 02:56:56.175]  And you can go read about it.
[02:56:56.195 --> 02:56:58.375]  It has a five-star rating on many of them.
[02:56:58.395 --> 02:56:59.516]  4.8 is the average.
[02:57:00.296 --> 02:57:03.057]  And this is what some of the folks have to say.
[02:57:03.998 --> 02:57:09.700]  Logan in Phoenix, Arizona says, I take six drops daily first thing in the morning and the results are terrific.
[02:57:10.905 --> 02:57:12.346]  Uh, here's Burlington, Wisconsin.
[02:57:12.406 --> 02:57:12.726]  Barrett.
[02:57:13.066 --> 02:57:13.986]  Says, super easy to use.
[02:57:14.006 --> 02:57:15.147]  Three dobs on the tongue in the morning.
[02:57:15.187 --> 02:57:15.647]  Tastes great.
[02:57:16.307 --> 02:57:22.510]  If I don't have time to take coffee, at least I know the five seconds I'll get the energy I need to get going by this product.
[02:57:22.530 --> 02:57:23.990]  Thank you for your support.
[02:57:24.390 --> 02:57:25.291]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:57:25.351 --> 02:57:29.973]  Both those are five-star reviews at InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:33.868 --> 02:57:36.589]  They've extended it to October 1st and then it's over.
[02:57:36.749 --> 02:57:41.692]  The best deals on MyPatriotSupply food ever at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:57:42.052 --> 02:57:44.553]  They're private labeling the exact same food just with a sticker.
[02:57:44.873 --> 02:57:47.695]  They can contractually give us an even lower price if it's private labeled.
[02:57:48.155 --> 02:57:49.816]  This is the lowest price they've ever offered.
[02:57:50.216 --> 02:57:51.657]  They already have the best lowest prices.
[02:57:51.697 --> 02:57:52.077]  So after...
[02:57:52.677 --> 02:57:56.299]  You know, next week it'll still be a great deal at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:57:56.559 --> 02:57:58.060]  But this is high-quality, storable food.
[02:57:58.200 --> 02:57:59.300]  You need it today.
[02:57:59.440 --> 02:58:02.502]  Only a crazy person would not be prepared right now.
[02:58:02.802 --> 02:58:17.949]  Check out the other amazing products like Knockout Sleep Aid, Methylcobalamin, Vitamin B12, Secret 12, Prostagard, high-quality Mediterranean organic concentrated oil of oregano capsules and more at InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:58:17.969 --> 02:58:18.449]  And in closing,
[02:58:22.252 --> 02:58:27.102]  I'm gonna come back in five minutes, take a few calls, and hand the baton to Watson for the fourth hour.
[02:58:29.818 --> 02:58:33.160]  Your purchase supports and makes this broadcast possible, so I want to thank you.
[02:58:33.920 --> 02:58:37.402]  And I want to encourage you to spread the word about this transmission to friends and family.
[02:58:37.962 --> 02:58:40.543]  Look, I'm just telling it like it is, teleprompter free.
[02:58:40.903 --> 02:58:43.365]  Just a wild Texan who doesn't want to be a slave.
[02:58:43.765 --> 02:58:46.006]  And I think you want to join me in that fight for human liberty.
[02:58:46.386 --> 02:58:47.767]  All right, some stations don't carry it.
[02:58:47.807 --> 02:58:48.647]  Fourth hour coming up.
[02:58:48.947 --> 02:58:50.548]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:50.568 --> 02:58:53.950]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:53.970 --> 02:58:55.711]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:59.941 --> 02:59:03.743]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[02:59:04.023 --> 02:59:14.349]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[02:59:14.489 --> 02:59:17.411]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[02:59:17.551 --> 02:59:26.554]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[02:59:26.694 --> 02:59:28.115]  This is the good halogen.
[02:59:28.215 --> 02:59:30.956]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[02:59:31.276 --> 02:59:43.060]  Now we at Infowarslife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure, 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:59:43.280 --> 02:59:44.541]  Watch the informational videos
[02:59:44.881 --> 02:59:47.102]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:12.549 --> 03:00:18.551]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:19.172 --> 03:00:22.193]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:24.054 --> 03:00:27.335]  We are back broadcasting, transmitting worldwide.
[03:00:28.055 --> 03:00:33.297]  Paul Joseph Watson from London, England will be joining us to host the fourth hour in T-minus eight minutes.
[03:00:33.818 --> 03:00:35.478]  Right now, let's go to Frank in Indiana.
[03:00:35.498 --> 03:00:36.539]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:00:38.660 --> 03:00:38.940]  Alex.
[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:39.760]  Yes, sir.
[03:00:40.940 --> 03:00:42.281]  Hey, uh, couple things real quick.
[03:00:44.241 --> 03:00:46.603]  Yes, his lordship has arrived.
[03:00:46.623 --> 03:00:50.867]  Alright, so today is the day of atonement, right?
[03:00:51.128 --> 03:00:53.630]  Lord God, on the issue of the day of atonement.
[03:00:54.271 --> 03:00:57.935]  It is today, from sundown to sunset, or sunset to sunrise.
[03:00:57.955 --> 03:01:01.318]  So we gotta get our hearts right at the end.
[03:01:01.919 --> 03:01:04.021]  We have the harbinger, the seventh harbinger, alright?
[03:01:04.878 --> 03:01:05.278]  I don't think.
[03:01:05.298 --> 03:01:06.840]  So it's going to happen big, yes.
[03:01:07.220 --> 03:01:08.641]  In this month, next month, whatever.
[03:01:08.681 --> 03:01:09.702]  But people need to watch.
[03:01:09.722 --> 03:01:11.384]  Well a lot of big stuff's already happening.
[03:01:11.404 --> 03:01:12.905]  We're just insulated in America.
[03:01:13.366 --> 03:01:15.427]  All Hades is breaking loose around the world.
[03:01:16.508 --> 03:01:16.989]  I completely agree.
[03:01:17.009 --> 03:01:17.429]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:01:17.790 --> 03:01:18.710]  I'll say something about Israel.
[03:01:18.730 --> 03:01:20.192]  Every time something about Israel happens...
[03:01:20.751 --> 03:01:22.433]  It happens here in the U.S.
[03:01:22.453 --> 03:01:22.693]  too.
[03:01:22.713 --> 03:01:22.813]  Yeah.
[03:01:22.833 --> 03:01:23.814]  Frank, I got a job.
[03:01:24.234 --> 03:01:26.296]  I barely understand what you're saying, but I got some of it.
[03:01:26.677 --> 03:01:28.458]  Try to call back on a better headset next time.
[03:01:28.518 --> 03:01:29.419]  Thank you so much, sir.
[03:01:30.160 --> 03:01:34.103]  Augusta, we're going to see if we're able to go to that caller from Alabama.
[03:01:34.604 --> 03:01:35.445]  Are you there this time?
[03:01:36.766 --> 03:01:37.246]  Yeah, I'm here.
[03:01:37.266 --> 03:01:38.027]  Sorry about that, Alex.
[03:01:38.047 --> 03:01:38.267]  No, no.
[03:01:38.307 --> 03:01:38.708]  You're okay.
[03:01:38.748 --> 03:01:39.348]  Thanks for holding.
[03:01:39.368 --> 03:01:39.689]  Go ahead.
[03:01:40.950 --> 03:01:41.770]  Yeah, thank you so much.
[03:01:42.730 --> 03:01:46.431]  Yeah, I just wanted to say that, you know, congratulations on the money, Bob, and that was awesome.
[03:01:46.531 --> 03:01:50.472]  It just shows you what the power of the people, you know, can do raising money.
[03:01:50.512 --> 03:01:52.792]  Please, congratulations to you, the listeners.
[03:01:52.852 --> 03:01:53.272]  Thank you.
[03:01:53.292 --> 03:01:55.633]  It's awesome.
[03:01:55.773 --> 03:01:58.193]  So, you know, I totally agree with all of the calls.
[03:01:58.213 --> 03:02:02.014]  And what people need to understand is that this is really good versus evil.
[03:02:03.014 --> 03:02:08.475]  And I think that the evil is now, you know, arriving in Europe, soon to arrive here.
[03:02:09.372 --> 03:02:12.534]  And, you know, we really have to stand up against this tyranny.
[03:02:12.854 --> 03:02:15.275]  This Pope is a New World Order Pope.
[03:02:16.095 --> 03:02:21.057]  And, you know, on a good note, though, I wanted to say that I'm a cancer survivor.
[03:02:21.077 --> 03:02:27.680]  Five out of four months in your products have really helped me to feel better, to get back to my normal life.
[03:02:28.001 --> 03:02:30.482]  I really love the nascent iodine.
[03:02:31.022 --> 03:02:37.605]  I've been on the Oxy Powder, Secret 12, and, hey, that Beyond Tangy Tangerine is delicious.
[03:02:38.427 --> 03:02:44.109]  So, you know, I just want to encourage everybody to put on the badge of courage and stand up for children.
[03:02:44.769 --> 03:02:53.551]  You know, the Bible really tells us that if anybody hurts a child, it's better for him to, you know, be drowned, having something hung around his neck.
[03:02:54.291 --> 03:03:04.034]  And I think it's our duty, our moral obligation to not only stand up against this Planned Parenthood debacle, murderers, people that they are organization.
[03:03:04.614 --> 03:03:06.535]  You know, our governor here, Governor Bentley,
[03:03:07.267 --> 03:03:17.193]  He defunded Planned Parenthood for a time, and then the mafia Obama administration threatened that they were going to cut, you know, Medicaid and Medicare and things like that.
[03:03:17.253 --> 03:03:17.534]  Sure.
[03:03:17.754 --> 03:03:20.535]  You know, we're up against a lot, but it's going to take more.
[03:03:20.555 --> 03:03:21.696]  We're up against a lot.
[03:03:21.736 --> 03:03:23.677]  I mean, worldwide depression by design.
[03:03:23.758 --> 03:03:30.482]  Our guests predicted that they would not get rid of QE Unlimited right away, and they haven't, so we'll see what unfolds.
[03:03:30.542 --> 03:03:30.882]  Thank you.
[03:03:30.962 --> 03:03:32.023]  Time for one more caller.
[03:03:32.363 --> 03:03:34.504]  The Pope was here the last time he was in the Western Hemisphere.
[03:03:34.524 --> 03:03:35.404]  Our hundred-year-old Freemason
[03:03:58.331 --> 03:04:03.013]  Encyclopedia says, under Pope, that he's the master bridge builder.
[03:04:03.954 --> 03:04:10.596]  And so you'll see him all through his life just keep building bridges, building bridges, almost at an insane rate.
[03:04:11.657 --> 03:04:22.562]  PSYOPs that they did here is the government-owned airlines, TAMI, from New York back to Ecuador a couple weeks ago, they had his face
[03:04:23.658 --> 03:04:29.460]  In a rainbow background, plastered all over the airplane, inside the compartments, above the old bulkheads.
[03:04:30.040 --> 03:04:32.641]  Every place you could put a full-size sticker, they put one.
[03:04:33.222 --> 03:04:37.223]  Even on the outside of the plane, as you come into the entrance of the plane, there's a big sticker.
[03:04:37.243 --> 03:04:42.265]  Yeah, the Globalists have fully taken over the Catholic Church, and this is their move, so they're now rebranding, and it's wonderful.
[03:04:44.142 --> 03:04:47.024]  So the CyOps is full speed ahead.
[03:04:48.045 --> 03:04:58.794]  And Ecuador is the only dollarized country in South America, so it's interesting to see that umbilical cord relationship, which is dastardly.
[03:04:58.834 --> 03:04:59.575]  Great point, Tom.
[03:04:59.615 --> 03:05:00.556]  Call back again soon.
[03:05:00.616 --> 03:05:01.957]  Sorry, I missed where you were calling from.
[03:05:01.977 --> 03:05:03.018]  I had to spend more time with you.
[03:05:03.058 --> 03:05:03.898]  Thank you to everybody else.
[03:05:04.138 --> 03:05:06.000]  Paul Watson's coming up from London.
[03:05:06.280 --> 03:05:07.621]  He's got a reporter in Germany.
[03:05:07.641 --> 03:05:08.062]  Stay with us.
[03:05:09.790 --> 03:05:11.971]  Kid Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[03:05:12.051 --> 03:05:14.933]  Did you know that Pope Francis has strong ties to communism?
[03:05:15.173 --> 03:05:21.416]  Francis is a member of the Jesuits who developed the so-called liberation theology, which many have labeled Christianized Marxism.
[03:05:21.636 --> 03:05:25.778]  They're the reason why communism and socialism has persevered for so long in Latin America.
[03:05:26.078 --> 03:05:31.980]  And it's not a coincidence that Cuba's current leader, Raul Castro, praised Pope Francis for his anti-capitalist stance.
[03:05:32.240 --> 03:05:34.941]  Castro, like Francis, was also brought up by the Jesuits.
[03:05:35.241 --> 03:05:40.482]  Starting to make sense now why Francis is constantly calling for carbon taxes and more government?
[03:05:40.723 --> 03:05:43.463]  And also, did you know the recent reconciliation between the U.S.
[03:05:43.503 --> 03:05:46.744]  and Cuba was spearheaded by Pope Francis to the benefit of Castro?
[03:05:47.004 --> 03:05:55.127]  Vatican researcher Leo Zagami wrote an excellent article on InfoWars.com entitled, Vatican Flag to Fly Over the New World Order, which breaks it all down.
[03:05:55.407 --> 03:06:05.492]  Zagami wrote, Barack Obama and Raul Castro's mandalist leftist agenda is guided and supervised by the first Jesuit Pope in history to help the Cubans embrace the new world order with enthusiasm.
[03:06:05.592 --> 03:06:09.294]  Keep checking InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv for more reports.
[03:06:10.354 --> 03:06:14.516]  Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life, vitamin B12 formulation.
[03:06:14.756 --> 03:06:20.621]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[03:06:20.861 --> 03:06:25.444]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[03:06:25.645 --> 03:06:28.967]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[03:06:29.227 --> 03:06:30.829]  No needles, no injections.

[03:06:43.898 --> 03:06:47.861]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[03:06:48.061 --> 03:06:52.844]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[03:06:53.004 --> 03:06:57.527]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[03:06:57.687 --> 03:07:00.990]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.

[03:07:09.355 --> 03:07:15.497]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[03:07:15.577 --> 03:07:18.218]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[03:07:18.258 --> 03:07:25.040]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[03:07:25.300 --> 03:07:28.161]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[03:07:28.281 --> 03:07:31.242]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[03:07:31.322 --> 03:07:33.222]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[03:07:33.262 --> 03:07:36.123]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[03:07:36.203 --> 03:07:41.685]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[03:07:41.905 --> 03:07:45.407]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[03:07:45.427 --> 03:07:48.408]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[03:07:48.508 --> 03:07:55.611]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[03:08:07.476 --> 03:08:16.358]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:16.718 --> 03:08:19.019]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:23.361 --> 03:08:23.801]  We're back.
[03:08:24.381 --> 03:08:27.582]  The Alex Jones Show live, fourth hour overdrive.
[03:08:27.642 --> 03:08:29.002]  I'm your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:08:29.022 --> 03:08:34.564]  We've got Leanne McAdoo popping in with some news updates over the course of the next hour.
[03:08:35.472 --> 03:08:46.577]  But first we're going to cross live to Germany to talk to geopolitical analyst and author Alex Benesch and you can find his work over on RecentR.com.
[03:08:46.737 --> 03:08:47.978]  Alex, welcome to the show!
[03:08:53.941 --> 03:08:54.701]  Do we have Alex?
[03:08:58.043 --> 03:08:59.523]  Okay, we're going to reconnect to Alex.
[03:09:00.224 --> 03:09:04.686]  I just posted an article over on Prison Planet Twitter which you can check out now.
[03:09:05.666 --> 03:09:08.108]  We've had these articles over the past three weeks.
[03:09:08.769 --> 03:09:17.636]  The rape crisis that is now engulfing Germany as a result of this migrant influx is really now reaching epidemic proportions.
[03:09:18.136 --> 03:09:28.165]  Police in Germany kept quiet about migrant raping a 13-year-old girl so as not to, quote, legitimize critics of mass migration.
[03:09:28.942 --> 03:09:32.723]  I'm going to talk to Alex about this when we get him back online because he's there in Germany.
[03:09:33.143 --> 03:09:53.390]  He's talking to people in Germany about this situation, about how the media is covering it up, which relates to my top story on Infowars.com this morning, which is that the German broadcaster ZDF, which is like a true crime program that airs on one of Germany's top networks over there in Europe,
[03:09:54.221 --> 03:09:59.361]  They basically had a case where a Muslim migrant who came over in the last three months
[03:10:00.035 --> 03:10:04.539]  raped a young girl who was a prime suspect in raping a young girl.
[03:10:05.039 --> 03:10:15.768]  They decided against airing the story because they said it might offend Muslim migrants coming over to Germany and it might quote inflame tensions.
[03:10:16.288 --> 03:10:18.370]  Now this is not in isolation.
[03:10:18.830 --> 03:10:21.613]  We've had numerous stories about this over the past few weeks.
[03:10:22.033 --> 03:10:25.776]  Now we've got more and I only just found out about this in the last hour or so.
[03:10:26.550 --> 03:10:31.554]  So we've got this 13 year old girl who was raped in a migrant camp in Germany.
[03:10:32.074 --> 03:10:41.862]  The police sat on the story for three months because they said they didn't want to legitimize critics of mass migration.
[03:10:42.323 --> 03:10:49.548]  No concern about the actual victim, no concern about the other women and children in those camps who are being preyed upon.
[03:10:50.049 --> 03:10:54.132]  We're now seeing articles about them charging 10 euros each.
[03:10:54.628 --> 03:10:56.429]  To rape these women and children.
[03:10:56.469 --> 03:10:58.390]  They're being forced into prostitution.
[03:10:59.290 --> 03:11:20.921]  Another case, in the town of Mehring, a Bavarian town over there in Germany, where police are now telling parents, as a result of another rape, which occurred on September 11th, just about 10-11 days ago, that police are now telling parents in that German town not to let their children go outside unaccompanied.
[03:11:21.874 --> 03:11:37.252]  We also had the case in Pocking, another German town, where girls are being told not to wear shorts or not to wear short skirts because there's a migrant camp attached to that school in its gymnasium.
[03:11:37.752 --> 03:11:40.736]  And so now the headteacher wrote a letter to the parents saying,
[03:11:41.451 --> 03:11:54.041]  We're not going to allow girls to wear shorts, we're not going to allow them to wear short skirts, because they could provoke attacks from these Muslim migrants, because they might offend these Muslim migrants.
[03:11:54.862 --> 03:12:03.349]  And the media, although this is being picked up on in local media, the major media networks in Germany are not broadcasting this.
[03:12:04.153 --> 03:12:13.238]  So it's unsurprising that polls which have come out in Germany suggest that upwards of 60% of Germans support this migrant invasion.
[03:12:13.759 --> 03:12:18.361]  Which of course will be 800,000 migrants before the end of the year.
[03:12:18.982 --> 03:12:21.703]  Potentially millions after that.
[03:12:21.783 --> 03:12:23.224]  Do we have Alex on the line yet?
[03:12:24.565 --> 03:12:25.245]  We've got Alex.
[03:12:25.305 --> 03:12:27.887]  So, you heard me talk about that there Alex.
[03:12:28.647 --> 03:12:31.509]  Are Germans even aware that these rape cases are happening?
[03:12:32.445 --> 03:12:35.917]  Is the media cover-up in Germany successful at this point?
[03:12:36.997 --> 03:12:46.002]  Well, it used to be pretty successful because normally you have like 250,000 people coming here per year, but now of course it's up to 800,000.
[03:12:46.482 --> 03:12:48.983]  Now everybody's talking about it.
[03:12:49.143 --> 03:12:50.484]  Everybody is talking about it.
[03:12:51.244 --> 03:12:58.708]  And I've looked at a scientific study, and it's a mainline study, and I'm sure there are similar studies on American immigration.
[03:12:59.268 --> 03:13:05.892]  And the study says that 25% of migrants coming here are backwards, radicals,
[03:13:07.652 --> 03:13:15.696]  Sometimes criminal and if you do the numbers that makes four million troublemakers in Germany.
[03:13:15.916 --> 03:13:18.717]  So in a country with 80 million people.
[03:13:19.438 --> 03:13:21.059]  So just to give you a comparison.
[03:13:22.279 --> 03:13:28.223]  Germany right now has 180,000 active military personnel, severely under-equipped.
[03:13:28.843 --> 03:13:38.208]  A quarter million cops, of course they don't work at the same time, at any given hour, and then we have a couple of thousand folks working in intelligence.
[03:13:38.609 --> 03:13:39.209]  That's it.
[03:13:39.729 --> 03:13:51.156]  How can they possibly manage four million troublemakers in Germany, plus the quarter percentage of new migrants coming in that are troublemakers as well?
[03:13:51.616 --> 03:13:52.276]  I understand.
[03:13:52.617 --> 03:13:57.439]  I looked at the study and of course, 25% of migrants are overachievers.
[03:13:57.459 --> 03:13:59.440]  You know, people come from Vietnam.
[03:13:59.801 --> 03:14:03.002]  They outperform German students and they do really well.
[03:14:03.883 --> 03:14:08.405]  And another 25% of migrants, they do okay, they do well.
[03:14:08.926 --> 03:14:14.008]  Another 25% gets by, but 25% are real troublemakers.
[03:14:14.769 --> 03:14:19.051]  They've created a problem that is way too big for the German state to handle.
[03:14:20.672 --> 03:14:22.033]  What's going to solve this problem?
[03:14:22.073 --> 03:14:36.625]  Of course Brussels, of course the European Union is creating this multinational border guard force and they want these centers in these countries of origin in North Africa and Syria.
[03:14:37.245 --> 03:14:42.829]  So people go to these places, then they are being assessed and then they're being brought here.
[03:14:43.770 --> 03:14:47.073]  So this is a serious problem.
[03:14:47.133 --> 03:15:04.049]  So if you can find studies like this on American immigration, or no matter where you come from, find these studies and do these numbers and see how many million troublemakers, real troublemakers, you have that have no loyalty to your country.
[03:15:05.510 --> 03:15:07.092]  And that's the point, isn't it?
[03:15:08.058 --> 03:15:09.619]  You know, they're bringing in so many.
[03:15:09.819 --> 03:15:16.585]  Obviously most of them, you know, eventually, you would hope, will integrate, will assimilate into society.
[03:15:16.805 --> 03:15:29.695]  But with the sheer volume of people that are being brought into Germany right now, many of them by people smugglers, there are going to be huge problems for social cohesion going forward over the next 5, 10, 20 years.
[03:15:30.216 --> 03:15:31.477]  And now it's confirmed
[03:15:32.136 --> 03:15:32.896]  I mean, I was saying 50%.
[03:15:33.077 --> 03:15:39.680]  I was merely going off of what the media was telling us, that 50% were, quote, Syrian refugees.
[03:15:40.101 --> 03:15:41.922]  It now turns out we've got the numbers.
[03:15:42.402 --> 03:15:47.245]  Only one-fifth of these, quote, refugees are actually Syrian.
[03:15:47.825 --> 03:16:09.253]  The rest are economic migrants fleeing to a higher standard of living, yet we've been browbeaten by politicians in Europe, by the media, into supporting this on humanitarian grounds, when it's based on a completely flimsy and inaccurate statistic that 50% of these people coming in were actually Syrian.
[03:16:09.293 --> 03:16:11.554]  We now know that not to be the case.
[03:16:12.354 --> 03:16:15.255]  But from your research, the bigger picture
[03:16:16.138 --> 03:16:25.350]  What is the EU and the politicians there in Germany hoping to achieve by rolling out the red carpet for this migrant influx?
[03:16:25.410 --> 03:16:28.674]  What is the long-term agenda geopolitically?
[03:16:29.853 --> 03:16:40.495]  Well, every American listening right now needs to understand it's important to keep an eye on Europe because the global power balance is rapidly shifting and changing.
[03:16:41.275 --> 03:16:48.576]  What the elite is doing in Europe right now is expanding the European Union into a Mediterranean super union.
[03:16:48.596 --> 03:16:57.858]  That's kind of a super empire that would match or surpass the other three big empires in the world, the United States, Russia and China.
[03:16:59.478 --> 03:17:03.779]  I think this Mediterranean Empire is at the heart of this migration crisis.
[03:17:05.140 --> 03:17:15.963]  The people in charge, the politicians and people above them, they are mixing populations through migration and they create a common history among the different nationalities.
[03:17:16.863 --> 03:17:18.683]  Syrians have no idea about Germany.
[03:17:18.744 --> 03:17:21.564]  Germans have no idea about Syria.
[03:17:22.265 --> 03:17:23.485]  There is no common
[03:17:24.225 --> 03:17:28.288]  Positive history between Germany and North Africa.
[03:17:28.708 --> 03:17:52.022]  The only thing that comes to mind, if you're interested in history, the only thing that comes to mind is that dark chapter in modern history when, you know, General Rommel tried to conquer North Africa and then moved east towards the Middle East and Syria, where he was stopped by the British and then the Americans came from the other side and pushed him back.
[03:17:53.983 --> 03:17:57.651]  They're creating an artificial common history that wasn't there before.
[03:17:58.633 --> 03:18:02.941]  Because you want to merge 43 completely different countries?
[03:18:04.556 --> 03:18:09.980]  You want to include Turkey, Syria, Israel, and so on into this Mediterranean Union.
[03:18:10.420 --> 03:18:13.642]  That's kind of a hyped-up version of ancient Rome.
[03:18:14.483 --> 03:18:19.806]  So, in the last few years, this Mediterranean Union process has officially stalled.
[03:18:21.427 --> 03:18:26.711]  The Mediterranean Union is supposed to exist only on paper, but the European Union is real.
[03:18:27.451 --> 03:18:29.392]  And they're playing a long game here.
[03:18:29.492 --> 03:18:31.494]  Ten years can make all the difference in the world.
[03:18:32.581 --> 03:18:38.265]  Years ago, the bureaucrats were already shopping for a headquarters for this Mediterranean Union.
[03:18:38.965 --> 03:18:44.689]  At that time, you still had Gaddafi in Libya, you had Mubarak in Egypt, and so on.
[03:18:45.230 --> 03:18:57.818]  So then the Arab Spring revolutions, they got rid of these old dictators and their families, paving the way for the integration of North Africa, possibly Syria, into this Mediterranean super empire.
[03:18:58.679 --> 03:19:02.161]  So the flood of migrants right now comes from North Africa and Syria.
[03:19:02.982 --> 03:19:03.742]  See how that works?
[03:19:04.803 --> 03:19:13.491]  And if realized, this Mediterranean Empire could be a, well, a very close partner of the United States.
[03:19:13.531 --> 03:19:18.656]  There could be a merger in the near future in order to keep up with the empires of the East.
[03:19:18.776 --> 03:19:25.402]  I mean, you've seen the transatlantic free trade agreement that's a building block of this European American Empire.
[03:19:27.143 --> 03:19:31.447]  Every American listening to this understands the following.
[03:19:32.008 --> 03:19:37.092]  A Mediterranean Empire would have more than twice the population of the United States.
[03:19:37.753 --> 03:19:42.897]  The combined military force would be enormous, maybe even surpassing the American military force.
[03:19:43.778 --> 03:19:52.182]  And if Europe or this Mediterranean Empire produces more nuclear weapons, you have a super player on a global stage.
[03:19:52.902 --> 03:19:55.203]  And that shifts power balance completely.
[03:19:55.263 --> 03:19:57.304]  I mean, current assessments...
[03:19:59.205 --> 03:20:04.909]  Many experts are predicting that food prices will surge this year due to the severe drought in California.

[03:25:30.281 --> 03:25:39.145]  Leanne McAdoo, we had an article in salon.com yesterday, which has pushed this mainstreaming of paedophilia for years and years.
[03:25:39.205 --> 03:25:40.966]  This is not the first instance of this.
[03:25:41.633 --> 03:25:59.405]  And this is a self-confessed paedophile called Todd Nickerson, who wrote an article published by left-wing outlet Salon, in which he called for readers to be, quote, understanding and supportive of people who are sexually attracted to children.
[03:25:59.806 --> 03:26:06.550]  I mean, if we thought we couldn't be any more repulsed by some of what the left comes out with, now we're hit with this.
[03:26:06.650 --> 03:26:07.271]  Break it down.
[03:26:08.092 --> 03:26:11.395]  All right, I mean, these are the new oppressed class.
[03:26:11.515 --> 03:26:14.598]  Where was my trigger warning before reading this story?
[03:26:14.978 --> 03:26:27.830]  You know, it doesn't get to the very, it takes, you have to read the entire article before he starts saying, you know, this is wrong and we need help and maybe that's why there should be some alternative outlets for us to go to for help.
[03:26:28.750 --> 03:26:32.075]  But it's basically the media promoting pedophile rights.
[03:26:32.736 --> 03:26:41.487]  And, you know, Rick Santorum, I guess, in 2003 said that this is what was going to happen when the country loses its moral values.
[03:26:41.587 --> 03:26:44.731]  And here, it's turning out to be true.
[03:26:45.512 --> 03:26:49.294]  Here, this man is saying, you know, have sympathy for us.
[03:26:49.434 --> 03:26:50.575]  Be understanding.
[03:26:51.175 --> 03:26:56.278]  This is something that, you know, goes so high up into our society.
[03:26:56.778 --> 03:27:06.864]  And it's kind of funny how this is being pushed in our face, but yet going back to the other segment, where other people are being silenced.
[03:27:07.304 --> 03:27:10.467]  When talking about child rape, for instance, our U.S.
[03:27:10.507 --> 03:27:16.854]  soldiers who are being told to ignore the sexual abuse of children by our Afghan allies.
[03:27:17.194 --> 03:27:22.379]  And then, of course, the German media covering up rapes being committed there by Muslim migrants.
[03:27:22.420 --> 03:27:28.386]  So, on the one hand, it's getting pushed in our face here, and then it's also silent on the other side.
[03:27:28.506 --> 03:27:30.007]  So, you know, it's just...
[03:27:30.788 --> 03:27:40.236]  It's pretty interesting to see how this whole globalist agenda is unfolding, this order out of chaos, how it's being orchestrated.
[03:27:40.316 --> 03:27:42.138]  But, I mean, what do you make of this?
[03:27:42.298 --> 03:27:43.339]  This is the new normal.
[03:27:45.480 --> 03:27:49.704]  I've got a video about this coming up in a couple of hours on Infowars.com.
[03:27:50.540 --> 03:27:57.762]  This basically strikes at the heart of how left-wing identity politics is underpinned by moral relativism.
[03:27:58.222 --> 03:28:01.503]  So that's why they don't call out, you know, Muslim rape cultures.
[03:28:01.543 --> 03:28:06.944]  That's why they don't call out people, gay people in Islamic countries being thrown off buildings.
[03:28:07.424 --> 03:28:09.945]  Because they have no moral compass.
[03:28:09.965 --> 03:28:11.705]  They have no foundation whatsoever.
[03:28:12.045 --> 03:28:15.306]  And the key thing about this, he argues that paedophilia
[03:28:16.056 --> 03:28:20.219]  is just a different form of, quote, sexual orientation.
[03:28:20.299 --> 03:28:20.519]  Right.
[03:28:20.640 --> 03:28:24.562]  And he couches it all in this, like, I'm a victim of circumstance.
[03:28:24.582 --> 03:28:25.823]  This is just what happened to me.
[03:28:26.424 --> 03:28:34.590]  So if pedophilia is just a form of sexual orientation, I guess necrophilia is also just a sexual orientation, right?
[03:28:34.630 --> 03:28:36.912]  People having sex with dead bodies.
[03:28:37.272 --> 03:28:40.995]  Should we accept and understand and support them in the name of tolerance?
[03:28:41.435 --> 03:28:42.716]  You know, bestiality.
[03:28:43.116 --> 03:28:45.338]  We're going to start accepting and tolerating that.
[03:28:45.865 --> 03:28:48.247]  As a legitimate sexual orientation.
[03:28:48.847 --> 03:28:55.491]  Are we going to start accepting and tolerating people who hack off their limbs because they find that erotic?
[03:28:55.671 --> 03:29:05.378]  Well, there was actually an article that Adan sent, an article where a man has been banned from playgrounds because he is aroused by children's slides at the playground.
[03:29:05.438 --> 03:29:13.303]  So, I mean, these are, it's just all bizarre, but it's all the new normal and you probably shouldn't be racist by judging these people.
[03:29:13.743 --> 03:29:25.967]  But I like how, uh, an article we have up that's out from Louder with Crowder, he talks about Wood Salon have posted the same exact article with the headline, I'm a racist, but I'm not a monster.
[03:29:26.087 --> 03:29:30.628]  I've never discriminated against a black man and I won't, but don't judge me harshly.
[03:29:30.728 --> 03:29:32.649]  And of course they wouldn't do anything like that.
[03:29:33.269 --> 03:29:36.110]  You know, or they wouldn't put an article about someone having rape fantasies.
[03:29:36.230 --> 03:29:38.431]  But, you know, I guess it's fine for pedophiles.
[03:29:40.166 --> 03:29:45.570]  And if you research the guy who was behind this article, you know, he talks about drooling over images of underage girls.
[03:29:45.891 --> 03:29:48.553]  He runs a forum called Virtuous Pedophiles.
[03:29:48.873 --> 03:29:52.016]  This is a sick, sick character, yet he's being given this platform.
[03:29:52.316 --> 03:29:53.477]  We're going to go to a break now.
[03:29:53.637 --> 03:29:59.302]  We'll be back with Alex Benesch, flipping back to the migrant crisis and how it's impacting Germany.
[03:29:59.322 --> 03:30:02.164]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.105 --> 03:30:05.767]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.026 --> 03:30:12.707]  Over the weekend, Cheryl Atkinson released the following article.
[03:30:12.888 --> 03:30:15.849]  What the news isn't saying about vaccine autism studies.
[03:30:16.129 --> 03:30:21.272]  She starts off with the New England Journal of Medicine study that says there is no link between vaccines and autism.
[03:30:21.492 --> 03:30:26.715]  She then discloses the consulting firm behind the study, the Lewin Group, lists major vaccine makers among its clients.
[03:30:26.895 --> 03:30:31.277]  In fact, the Lewin Group's parent company, United Health Group, is a key government partner in Obamacare.
[03:30:31.417 --> 03:30:36.418]  And a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, QSSI, was given the contract to build the Obamacare website.
[03:30:36.558 --> 03:30:50.061]  She then looks at the AstroTurf propaganda campaign and some of the buzzwords they use, like weak, too small, haphazard, not replicated, junk science, flawed, unrelated, and how these words are used over and over again to attack anybody who questions the vaccine mafia.
[03:30:50.241 --> 03:30:55.362]  She then covers over 13 different studies that show a correlation between vaccine intake and brain damage.
[03:30:55.642 --> 03:31:01.083]  In fact, permanent brain damage is an acknowledged rare side effect of vaccines, and there's no dispute in that arena.
[03:31:01.223 --> 03:31:06.386]  So the next time your herd mentality friends are pushing vaccine propaganda in your face, shove this back in theirs.

[03:33:12.566 --> 03:33:18.590]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:33:19.191 --> 03:33:22.173]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:25.546 --> 03:33:28.967]  We're back for the fourth hour live of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:28.987 --> 03:33:29.987]  This is Overdrive.
[03:33:30.027 --> 03:33:31.528]  I'm your host Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:32.068 --> 03:33:42.351]  We're talking to geopolitical analyst and author Alexander Banesh, who is over there in Germany tracking the migrant crisis just before the last segment.
[03:33:42.991 --> 03:33:51.193]  We dipped into the fact that they're using this crisis that they've created in the first place to centralize power into fewer hands.
[03:33:51.761 --> 03:34:06.737]  Now we had the Mediterranean, the Union for the Mediterranean, which was this concept proposed by EU leaders and Bilderbergers back in 2008, 2009, to absorb these North African countries and these Middle Eastern countries.
[03:34:07.606 --> 03:34:30.063]  into this Mediterranean Union, which will then be allied with the North American Union, again centralising power into fewer hands as these federal super states, which are anti-democratic, which is what the EU has built its whole platform, its whole raison d'etre around, into conglomerating into these huge power blocks that aren't representative, that aren't democratic.
[03:34:30.704 --> 03:34:34.727]  Now they're exploiting the migrant crisis for that very purpose.
[03:34:34.767 --> 03:34:36.148]  Now Alex, I read a quote from
[03:34:36.909 --> 03:34:51.039]  Javier Solana, who is the former NATO Secretary General and a top Bilderberger, who was espousing this plan for a Mediterranean Union involving all these different Middle Eastern, North African countries to absorb them into the EU.
[03:34:51.579 --> 03:34:57.984]  He said that it was necessary as a process to foster cultural unity.
[03:34:58.605 --> 03:35:04.729]  So bearing in mind we just talked about the rape crisis that is now sweeping these migrant camps in Germany,
[03:35:05.558 --> 03:35:14.781]  Why would we want cultural unity with a culture based on a barbarous religion that is stuck in the 7th century?
[03:35:15.161 --> 03:35:17.541]  Why can't we maintain our cultures separately?
[03:35:17.882 --> 03:35:21.202]  We know that multiculturalism has been a complete failure.
[03:35:21.543 --> 03:35:24.223]  Even Merkel herself admitted that a few years ago.
[03:35:24.783 --> 03:35:29.965]  So why are they trying to fuse our cultures together when it's been proven not to work?
[03:35:31.525 --> 03:35:35.167]  Well, the most important answer to this question is this.
[03:35:35.668 --> 03:35:41.332]  The biggest and most important control mechanism for populations is personality disorders.
[03:35:42.012 --> 03:35:57.202]  Whether it's pedophilia, which is often linked to antisocial disorder and narcissism, or it's migrants that come from countries of origin that are dominated by people with antisocial disorder and these really nasty disorders.
[03:36:02.105 --> 03:36:06.989]  A single person could be a pedophile, could be a really bad migrant.
[03:36:08.350 --> 03:36:14.614]  Every bad, single bad person can hurt any number of healthy people out there.
[03:36:14.694 --> 03:36:18.017]  So if you have a certain percentage of people with heavy disorders,
[03:36:18.894 --> 03:36:27.299]  And you think, okay, every single dangerous person will keep a certain number of other people, healthy people, busy or hurt these other people.
[03:36:28.140 --> 03:36:41.989]  Then you can do the numbers in your head and you realize that every country, according to the elites, every country needs constant traumatization to create new people with disorders.
[03:36:42.589 --> 03:36:51.771]  So some of the migrants are being hurt by bad migrants and that makes them, gives them post-traumatic stress and that keeps them busy for the rest of their lives.
[03:36:52.571 --> 03:37:02.534]  And let's also not forget every second German, every other German statistically, from the old baby boomer generation has cancer.
[03:37:03.134 --> 03:37:06.095]  So Germany has one of the lowest growth rates.
[03:37:06.255 --> 03:37:07.135]  We have like a one
[03:37:08.496 --> 03:37:11.438]  1.3% growth rate, which is actually a shrinking rate.
[03:37:11.958 --> 03:37:13.879]  So Germany is actually shrinking.
[03:37:14.640 --> 03:37:27.788]  And the argument is we need a flood of migrants every year for the next 35 years in order to prevent a collapse of population numbers, a collapse of the retirement system and so on.
[03:37:28.909 --> 03:37:39.223]  We're being flooded with traumatized people, people with antisocial disorder, narcissistic disorder, and a mixture of disorders to keep us all very busy.
[03:37:40.231 --> 03:37:50.835]  And everybody who got cancer, presumably from, for example, the shots they get, getting cancer is traumatic.
[03:37:50.896 --> 03:37:54.477]  And it's not just traumatic for the person getting ill, it's traumatic for the whole family.
[03:37:54.557 --> 03:38:05.722]  So, it's a system where you keep a population busy, so they have no time and energy to deal with the evil system that's above them.
[03:38:09.236 --> 03:38:17.302]  In Europe right now, you see the same kind of things going on that you see in the United States.
[03:38:18.282 --> 03:38:18.923]  Listen to this.
[03:38:22.592 --> 03:38:38.869]  If you have a Jeb Bush president, my prediction will be he will intensify a North American Union process and he will intensify
[03:38:40.089 --> 03:38:40.149]  I'm
[03:39:01.430 --> 03:39:10.670]  Russia doesn't have a lot of people, but they have a lot of nukes, and this Mediterranean Union could become a serious, serious monster of a geopolitical player.
[03:39:12.866 --> 03:39:28.835]  If Jeb Bush wins the presidency, you would have a leader who has a college degree in Latin American affairs, who worked in Mexico as a student, who worked in Venezuela, who's fluent in Spanish, whose wife is of Mexican origin, and who became a Catholic.
[03:39:29.435 --> 03:39:40.441]  So he can totally appeal to a broad audience and can integrate the legal and illegal Latinos, advance an American Union, and then intensify the cooperation with this
[03:39:41.141 --> 03:39:46.906]  Monstrosity, a Mediterranean Union, that's a pretty likely scenario.
[03:39:47.747 --> 03:39:51.950]  So that's kind of at the heart of this migration crisis.
[03:39:52.150 --> 03:39:57.094]  And here's another interesting part of this.
[03:39:59.556 --> 03:40:14.043]  A lot of these Arab Spring countries, where a lot of the migrants come from at the moment, mostly to Germany, a lot of these Arab Spring countries, they were allied with Russia, like Syria still is allied with Russia.
[03:40:17.924 --> 03:40:23.667]  And even Mubarak in Egypt had that sort of alliance and that's why he was removed.
[03:40:24.187 --> 03:40:30.969]  There have been documents stolen from the Gorbachev archive by a guy called Stroylov.
[03:40:30.989 --> 03:40:32.270]  That's a pretty recent development.
[03:40:32.730 --> 03:40:33.390]  So we now have like 50,000
[03:40:35.111 --> 03:40:37.614]  Previously secret documents from the Russians.
[03:40:38.394 --> 03:40:48.484]  And I have this quote here where Mubarak talks to Gorbachev and he says, yeah, we have 50 billion dollars of debt, but we're not going to pay that back.
[03:40:48.524 --> 03:40:49.985]  We're not expected to pay that back.
[03:40:51.207 --> 03:40:55.070]  We get 1.3 billion in military aid from the United States.
[03:40:55.551 --> 03:40:56.912]  We can't do without that.
[03:40:58.093 --> 03:40:59.595]  Well, but this is going to change.
[03:41:00.699 --> 03:41:03.162]  Time will come when things turn in a different direction.
[03:41:03.623 --> 03:41:07.267]  I'm telling this to you absolutely frankly, is what Mubarak said.
[03:41:07.867 --> 03:41:15.736]  So that's why Mubarak was removed and now we get all these refugees from these war-torn countries and they come to Germany.
[03:41:16.776 --> 03:41:23.561]  And also every intelligence agency in the world must be buying fake Syrian passports right now.
[03:41:24.662 --> 03:41:29.946]  Every terrorist organization worth their money would be buying fake Syrian passports right now.
[03:41:30.526 --> 03:41:37.151]  Because with a Syrian passport you're almost guaranteed German asylum and ultimately citizenship.
[03:41:39.353 --> 03:41:40.374]  And just to go back on
[03:41:41.053 --> 03:41:46.774]  This idea, and it is a fact that Germany is losing a hundred thousand people a year without the mass immigration.
[03:41:47.415 --> 03:41:55.077]  But then on the other hand, right over the border, you've got the Czech Republic, which has had a stable population for a hundred years.
[03:41:55.557 --> 03:41:58.057]  They don't have a mass immigration policy.
[03:41:58.377 --> 03:41:59.978]  They've got a good standard of living.
[03:42:00.018 --> 03:42:01.738]  They've got relatively cheap housing.
[03:42:02.178 --> 03:42:05.919]  They've got high employment with the host population.
[03:42:06.239 --> 03:42:08.660]  It's the most thriving country in Europe.
[03:42:09.244 --> 03:42:14.152]  Along with Hungary, they've been amongst the most resistant to this migrant invasion.
[03:42:14.653 --> 03:42:23.447]  So is this argument legitimate that Germany needs to import these floods of people simply to top up their demographics?
[03:42:24.199 --> 03:42:29.240]  Or is that more because there are no incentives for people to have children in Germany?
[03:42:29.500 --> 03:42:37.462]  It's being kind of frowned upon by, you know, this cultural movement of third-wave feminism, which treats childbearing as some kind of burden.
[03:42:38.002 --> 03:42:43.244]  Where does the true problem lie in that demographic crisis that Germany is supposedly experiencing?
[03:42:44.084 --> 03:42:49.465]  Well, one thing is the strong prevalence of personality disorders in Germany.
[03:42:49.545 --> 03:42:51.085]  People don't want to have children.
[03:42:51.105 --> 03:42:52.026]  They've had a
[03:42:54.071 --> 03:42:56.593]  Bad or even terrible family experience themselves.
[03:42:56.633 --> 03:42:57.554]  They don't want children.
[03:42:58.094 --> 03:43:04.720]  They see how the old generation, the baby boomer generation, how they work themselves to death, how they got cancer.
[03:43:06.381 --> 03:43:09.364]  Every second of the baby boomer generation now has cancer.
[03:43:09.384 --> 03:43:12.146]  So all that's very traumatizing and people don't want to have children.
[03:43:13.218 --> 03:43:25.111]  If we had had a normal growth rate in Germany over the last few decades, we would have a population right now of 100 to 120 million Germans people.
[03:43:25.892 --> 03:43:30.116]  And you would have kind of a migration portion of that of about 5% max.
[03:43:30.136 --> 03:43:30.777]  So imagine 120 million
[03:43:36.746 --> 03:43:41.310]  120 million Germans, 5% migration background, fully integrated.
[03:43:41.470 --> 03:43:43.912]  That would have been possible, easily possible.
[03:43:44.673 --> 03:43:49.256]  But that would mean Germany would be a more sovereign state.
[03:43:49.336 --> 03:43:56.142]  That would mean Germany would not need a European Union or a Mediterranean Union or a transatlantic union.
[03:43:56.882 --> 03:43:58.083]  Uh, to fix problems.
[03:43:58.343 --> 03:44:08.689]  So, uh, we see the same kind of migration, um, percentage in other major countries in Europe, like, uh, United Kingdom or, or France.
[03:44:09.109 --> 03:44:09.969]  It's always this 20%.
[03:44:10.109 --> 03:44:22.556]  Uh, it's not enough to, um, take away constitutional voting majority from the, the, the majority, uh, of citizens, but they're getting closer and closer to taking that away.
[03:44:23.157 --> 03:44:23.497]  And, um,
[03:44:24.378 --> 03:44:31.523]  Yeah, a normal growth rate, imagine the United Kingdom has one of the most dense populations.
[03:44:33.985 --> 03:44:38.288]  Germany has one of the most dense populations and this is a situation where
[03:44:44.327 --> 03:44:47.832]  You would need more children, more babies.
[03:44:47.972 --> 03:44:49.294]  I always tell that to people.
[03:44:49.835 --> 03:44:53.099]  Don't just talk, don't just try to work this out politically.
[03:44:53.520 --> 03:44:54.681]  Have more children.
[03:44:55.082 --> 03:44:57.865]  Me and my wife, we have two children and if we
[03:44:59.697 --> 03:45:03.240]  If we weren't paying so many taxes, we would have four children or maybe five.
[03:45:03.940 --> 03:45:07.263]  But the state does not want you to have these children.
[03:45:08.123 --> 03:45:11.246]  And so they're saying we need these migrants to bolster the numbers.
[03:45:11.646 --> 03:45:14.108]  And I read an article in mainstream media.
[03:45:14.928 --> 03:45:27.715]  Saying that Germany needs to learn from former East Germany, socialist Soviet East Germany, because they had this government system where the state was raising your children.
[03:45:28.255 --> 03:45:35.439]  A conservative politician said we need to learn from from former Shazi Germany, basically.
[03:45:35.479 --> 03:45:40.282]  So this is getting insane because they need to put on the brakes right now.
[03:45:40.402 --> 03:45:41.483]  No, we're good to go.
[03:45:57.330 --> 03:45:59.871]  The Frontex, the multinational Frontex patrol.
[03:46:00.311 --> 03:46:08.453]  So it's not just... So they're going to try and roll into the European army once they get social unrest and race riots as a result of this mass influx of immigrants, right?
[03:46:08.933 --> 03:46:09.513]  Yes, yes.
[03:46:09.913 --> 03:46:18.455]  So previously it's been just Spanish police, Spanish border guards pushing away people from North Africa.
[03:46:18.535 --> 03:46:23.396]  But soon there's going to be a multinational force pushing people back and dealing with this.
[03:46:24.516 --> 03:46:28.479]  People can't get angry just at the Spanish border guards.
[03:46:28.880 --> 03:46:31.181]  They're going to be angry at the whole European Union.
[03:46:31.261 --> 03:46:35.284]  So the responsibility is on more shoulders.
[03:46:35.324 --> 03:46:36.986]  You can manage the anger better.
[03:46:37.006 --> 03:46:39.007]  You can manage the situation better.
[03:46:39.648 --> 03:46:45.372]  And when this is a success, they're going to have a multinational European Union army.
[03:46:46.332 --> 03:46:59.522]  And we've seen kind of the preparations for that for the last 20 years and every Bilderberg conference you see these massive attendees who talk about this and build this European Union force.
[03:47:01.103 --> 03:47:04.666]  I said before we have at least 4 million
[03:47:05.603 --> 03:47:08.824]  Troublesome, problematic migrants in Germany right now.
[03:47:09.024 --> 03:47:15.587]  Four million troublemakers right now in a country of 80 million with 180,000 active troops.
[03:47:15.747 --> 03:47:25.531]  So this is a big threat and only the European Union army could fix this threat, could solve a problem that arises.
[03:47:26.631 --> 03:47:28.972]  And this is very scary because
[03:47:30.526 --> 03:47:37.209]  Germany's forces have been shrunk, France's forces have been shrunk, Britain's forces have been shrunk.
[03:47:37.249 --> 03:47:43.011]  They said the Cold War is over, don't worry, we'll spend all that money on migrants and socialist programs.
[03:47:43.491 --> 03:47:45.472]  But now they say, oh my god, it's back on!
[03:47:46.432 --> 03:47:50.394]  So no single European country can defend itself.
[03:47:51.294 --> 03:47:56.316]  I've read articles in Foreign Policy magazine, NATO cannot defend the Baltics.
[03:47:57.137 --> 03:48:13.813]  So, all this building... We've also got the French Army now, as of a few weeks ago, preparing for civil unrest and immigrant uprising from these Muslim ghetto towns and areas in major cities, where, you know, it's basically a no-go area.
[03:48:14.193 --> 03:48:19.118]  They're being funneled arms from these very same jihadist groups that our government supported.
[03:48:19.478 --> 03:48:28.660]  They're talking about having to go in and reclaim entire areas of French cities because of this, quote, immigrant uprising which they're expecting to happen.
[03:48:28.900 --> 03:48:47.545]  So in the name of multiculturalism and avoiding the clash of civilizations, their actions are creating a fertile ground for this clash of civilizations, out of which they will get expanded power through a European army, through further centralization of power, with an expanding EU bureaucracy.
[03:48:48.909 --> 03:49:05.422]  Exactly, and imagine a scenario where you have, for example, a major empire, a major global actor like Russia, supporting migrant groups or supporting different groups in Europe.
[03:49:05.583 --> 03:49:16.852]  I mean, I've seen information that the Russians, they still support the left in Europe, they support the right in Europe, and they support the Muslims in Europe.
[03:49:17.832 --> 03:49:26.676]  Every power player, every major power player is trying to play this game of destabilization and then re-stabilization.
[03:49:29.034 --> 03:49:42.584]  If you have a situation where things become hot, then you would see this multinational force coming in and exercising some of these powers in the European Union constitution.
[03:49:42.644 --> 03:49:57.515]  I mean, back when it was rammed through, people found these paragraphs that deal with uprisings and soldiers from any member state can be used in any other member state.
[03:49:58.681 --> 03:50:05.727]  In the future, they might use Romanian troops in Britain or British troops in Germany or whatever.
[03:50:06.528 --> 03:50:08.029]  This is completely nasty.
[03:50:11.192 --> 03:50:15.415]  I think that it's Brussels, of course, playing this game.
[03:50:15.515 --> 03:50:17.917]  It's the United States overlooking this game.
[03:50:18.698 --> 03:50:24.663]  Germany is dependent on the NSA to tell them who's a dangerous person, who you should look for.
[03:50:27.125 --> 03:50:46.541]  That's because Germany's intelligence is so weak, Germany has always had weak intelligence, and troops are very slim and under-equipped, so Germany has been kept artificially weak, so we are dependent on the British spying system, the GCHQ, and the American NSA.
[03:50:48.323 --> 03:50:49.664]  They're tossing these balls.
[03:50:50.625 --> 03:50:52.486]  They're tossing these balls back and forth.
[03:50:52.586 --> 03:50:56.349]  And remember these so-called 9-11 hijackers.
[03:50:56.409 --> 03:50:59.110]  Guess where they spend a lot of time in Germany?
[03:50:59.691 --> 03:51:02.813]  It was in northern Germany, the city of Hamburg.
[03:51:03.013 --> 03:51:08.317]  And we'll be back to finish and round up this after the break with Alexander Banesh of RecentR.com.
[03:51:08.337 --> 03:51:10.418]  This is the Alex Jones Show, live, 4th hour.
[03:51:15.836 --> 03:51:17.739]  Hey neighbor, what are you doing digging?
[03:51:17.899 --> 03:51:19.582]  You had a heart attack last year.
[03:51:19.602 --> 03:51:20.844]  Oh, I know.
[03:51:21.104 --> 03:51:22.426]  I was told no more hard labor.
[03:51:23.007 --> 03:51:24.108]  Then why are you digging?
[03:51:24.589 --> 03:51:25.931]  Well, I've been taking extendovite.
[03:51:26.452 --> 03:51:27.674]  It's been approved to help my heart.
[03:51:28.195 --> 03:51:29.076]  Extendovite?
[03:51:29.256 --> 03:51:30.137]  Is that a new drug?
[03:51:30.973 --> 03:51:31.733]  No, not a drug.
[03:51:32.333 --> 03:51:35.654]  It's more like an herbal combination made from garlic and cayenne.
[03:51:36.154 --> 03:51:36.635]  Herbal?
[03:51:36.795 --> 03:51:37.675]  How can that help?
[03:51:38.295 --> 03:51:40.256]  Well, actually, we've taken herbs for thousands of years.
[03:51:40.796 --> 03:51:42.396]  Extendivite is doing the job for me.
[03:51:42.876 --> 03:51:44.957]  Does your doctor know about Extendivite?
[03:51:45.497 --> 03:51:49.078]  Yeah, my doctor knows, and he said it seems to be working for you, so don't stop taking it.
[03:51:49.378 --> 03:51:50.820]  I feel great taking Xtendivite.
[03:51:51.140 --> 03:51:51.901]  I don't want to stop.
[03:51:52.302 --> 03:51:53.243]  To order, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:53.263 --> 03:51:53.824]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:53.844 --> 03:51:55.486]  Or visit our website at heartdrop.com.
[03:52:09.671 --> 03:52:10.953]  It's now more clear than ever.
[03:52:11.153 --> 03:52:14.776]  The Globalists have launched a planetary destabilization plan.
[03:52:14.876 --> 03:52:18.419]  Here at the Infowars operation, we hope and pray that this is not the case.
[03:52:18.700 --> 03:52:22.483]  But the signs of things deteriorating around the world are unmistakable.
[03:52:22.623 --> 03:52:29.205]  For many years, I've been working with MyPatriotSupply, and we have now developed a private label called InfoWars Select.
[03:52:29.405 --> 03:52:34.167]  Look, it's important to have firearms and water filtration during a collapse, but you've also got to have food.
[03:52:34.387 --> 03:52:42.070]  InfoWars Select is a wide variety of their highest quality packages at the lowest price they have ever offered before.
[03:52:42.190 --> 03:52:42.610]  We're good to go.
[03:53:09.471 --> 03:53:12.474]  Don't complain about your cable bill going up and up and up.
[03:53:12.594 --> 03:53:13.635]  Do something about it.
[03:53:13.795 --> 03:53:15.837]  Grab a pencil and jot down this special number.
[03:53:15.857 --> 03:53:18.420]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:53:18.660 --> 03:53:22.203]  The more cable TV rates go up, the better digital satellite TV looks.
[03:53:22.624 --> 03:53:28.189]  Say goodbye to the cable guy and get more of your favorite channels in 100% digital quality for less money.
[03:53:28.329 --> 03:53:28.810]  Call 1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:53:31.272 --> 03:53:35.014]  Sign up for packages starting as low as $19.99, and there's no equipment to buy.
[03:53:35.094 --> 03:53:39.957]  You get free HDTV upgrade, a free DVR upgrade, and free professional installation.
[03:53:40.137 --> 03:53:42.499]  You control what you watch, when you watch it.
[03:53:42.779 --> 03:53:47.382]  Record your favorite shows, pause and rewind live TV, even skip the commercials.
[03:53:47.742 --> 03:53:49.063]  Watch local channels, too.
[03:53:49.263 --> 03:53:51.723]  At just $19.99, what are you waiting for?
[03:53:51.903 --> 03:53:53.744]  Pull out your major credit or debit card.
[03:53:53.824 --> 03:53:57.105]  Call 1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:53:57.125 --> 03:53:58.646]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:53:59.166 --> 03:54:00.807]  Say goodbye to the cable guy.
[03:54:01.027 --> 03:54:02.567]  Cut costs and get more.
[03:54:02.587 --> 03:54:02.967]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:54:02.987 --> 03:54:03.327]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:54:20.738 --> 03:54:32.047]  We're going to go to Leanne McAdoo here in a couple of minutes to talk about what's coming up on the InfoWars Nightly News, but just wrapping up in the final two minutes here, Alexander Banesh, geopolitical analyst.
[03:54:32.687 --> 03:54:41.114]  Tell people how they can find out more about the information you're putting out about the migrant crisis and other geopolitical topics over at your website.
[03:54:42.677 --> 03:54:49.922]  My website is recentr.com and I also have sort of an English language website.
[03:54:49.942 --> 03:54:58.728]  I need to put on a prominent link on this so I can, so I'm compelled to produce more English language content.
[03:54:59.489 --> 03:55:09.936]  I'm also thinking about translating some of the books that I've put together on kind of the wars of the future, robot wars and weapons of the future.
[03:55:10.977 --> 03:55:31.026]  I also encourage people to really get into this East-West, study this East-West conflict, because they basically force us to choose between a world war or a world government, so never forget decades of close East-West collaboration, and they might still be working together.
[03:55:31.166 --> 03:55:34.808]  I mean, East and West, they still might be secretly working together at the top,
[03:55:35.388 --> 03:55:36.929]  To destroy opposition at home.
[03:55:39.071 --> 03:55:46.457]  Everybody at home who wants freedom, they will be branded a traitor to their own country and a collaborator with the other side.
[03:55:48.719 --> 03:55:52.422]  Dust off the old Anthony Sutton books.
[03:55:52.622 --> 03:56:00.269]  Dust off some of these great true historians and understand what that means for our situation today.
[03:56:01.431 --> 03:56:05.257]  Okay, Alexander Bnesh, RecentR.com, thanks for joining us.
[03:56:06.439 --> 03:56:07.160]  Thank you for having me.
[03:56:08.282 --> 03:56:11.167]  Okay, Liam McAdoo, we got the InfoWars Nightly News coming up.
[03:56:11.287 --> 03:56:14.832]  Tell us some of the topics that you will be covering on tonight's show.
[03:56:15.714 --> 03:56:22.357]  Well, we're definitely going to be discussing how there's this cover-up of rape crisis that's going on of children.
[03:56:22.797 --> 03:56:26.999]  The cover-up while at the same time pushing pedophilia here in the United States.
[03:56:27.539 --> 03:56:30.901]  But I also wanted to talk about an article BuzzFeed posted about Trump.
[03:56:31.781 --> 03:56:36.085]  Trump once proposed that an A-team of CEOs negotiate U.S.
[03:56:36.205 --> 03:56:47.054]  trade policy with foreign nations, and so they're basically lamenting the fact that Trump once proposed giving this constitutional authority to negotiate trade deals with top business leaders.
[03:56:47.434 --> 03:56:55.841]  Well, they fail to mention that that's exactly what is trying to be fast-tracked by the Obama administration right now with the TPP.
[03:56:56.121 --> 03:57:00.325]  It's the heads of 600 corporations that are at the negotiation table.
[03:57:01.005 --> 03:57:05.489]  And, you know, our Congress hasn't even really been able to see what's in that trade deal.
[03:57:05.509 --> 03:57:06.930]  So that's exactly what's happening.
[03:57:07.330 --> 03:57:20.341]  And if you want to know what that looks like, another story we're going to be talking about is how a greedy hedge funder raised the price of a medication that's used by some AIDS patients by 5,000 percent.
[03:57:20.621 --> 03:57:21.862]  It went from $13 a pill to now $750 a pill.
[03:57:25.385 --> 03:57:44.513]  And if you looked at one of the leaked chapters out of the TPP, it talks about how it's a huge win for Big Pharma because they're basically going to be able to raise the prices on everything and thereby limit people who are less fortunate to have access to these medications.
[03:57:44.894 --> 03:57:52.237]  So we're basically seeing all of that unfolding and so those are just some of the things we're going to be talking about on the nightly news tonight.
[03:57:53.317 --> 03:57:56.058]  Also, a big university just banned trigger warnings.
