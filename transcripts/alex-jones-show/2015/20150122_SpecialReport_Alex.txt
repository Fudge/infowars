[00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:09.849]  Recently, the Prime Minister of Turkey, which is a NATO country, was caught by his own military smuggling guns to ISIS in Syria.
[00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.170]  Now, why would he do that?
[00:00:11.771 --> 00:00:20.998]  For one thing, Turkey is predominantly Sunni Muslim, whereas Syria is Shiite Muslim, and there's been a centuries-old conflict between Sunnis and Shiites.
[00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.784]  Also, Syria rivals Turkey as a place to put a strategic oil pipeline running from Russia to the West.
[00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:39.531]  Now, if this pipeline is worth billions of dollars, maybe even trillions of dollars, and it would be to NATO's benefit if the pipeline was run through Turkey so they could geopolitically isolate Russia if they wanted to.
[00:00:40.512 --> 00:00:55.422]  So, this is why you see Turkey openly funding, arming, training ISIS as part of their proxy war to topple the Syrian government so they can go into Syria, take the oil, then install a public regime that promotes their own agenda.

[00:00:58.404 --> 00:00:58.628]  We're good.
