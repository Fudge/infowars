[00:00:00.391 --> 00:00:03.002]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:15.543 --> 00:00:16.184]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:17.866]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.627 --> 00:00:19.728]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.389 --> 00:00:21.189]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.871]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.512 --> 00:00:27.156]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:31.762]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.011]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:39.856]  I'm David Knight on this Wednesday, April 1st, April Fool's Day.
[00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:44.080]  You know, it's almost like every day is April Fool's Day.
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.448]  That's why we're accused of being conspiracy theorists, because whenever the government tells us anything, we always have to step back and say...
[00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:53.069]  Is that for real?
[00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.610]  Or are they pulling our leg?
[00:00:55.671 --> 00:01:00.193]  We have a government that is so obviously lying to us about so many things.
[00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:02.114]  Not transparent about anything.
[00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:03.835]  Everything is a government secret.
[00:01:04.395 --> 00:01:08.978]  And they've been caught so many times lying that every day we have to ask that.
[00:01:09.018 --> 00:01:11.979]  And that's why we are conspiracy investigators.
[00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.600]  We're looking to see
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.526]  If the government is doing something illegal, if they're lying to us about what their intentions are, that's why there's so much speculation about what's going on with this Jade Helm exercise.
[00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.828]  Of course, the military runs exercises all the time.
[00:01:24.368 --> 00:01:40.660]  However, when they do these things in urban populated areas, when they get off of the bases, when they are practicing, and I think this is key, when they are practicing to go undetected amongst the American public in civilian clothes, that makes you question what their mission is.
[00:01:41.752 --> 00:01:46.415]  Because we've been lied to too many times by our government, by our military.
[00:01:47.276 --> 00:01:51.018]  One of the things that I think we should question is something that just came out.
[00:01:51.038 --> 00:01:52.399]  We're going to talk about this in detail.
[00:01:53.834 --> 00:02:03.176]  The DEA, after busting Silk Road, and of course Alex talked to the mother of Ross Ulbrich, who was accused of being Dread Pirate Roberts.
[00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:08.477]  This is a website that was a conduit essentially for illegal drug trade.
[00:02:09.377 --> 00:02:17.979]  And so they came after this and now we find that the key agents, the DEA agent as well as a Secret Service agent,
[00:02:18.752 --> 00:02:25.435]  Were involved in fraud, theft of government property, money laundering, on and on and on.
[00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:30.417]  And all of this information was withheld in the trial.
[00:02:30.537 --> 00:02:34.438]  Even though they knew this, they were not allowed, the defense was not allowed to bring this up.
[00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.361]  Even to the extent that these guys are running multiple names, involved in the orchestrated murder for hire.
[00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:46.563]  All of this did not come out in the trial, was shut down in the trial.
[00:02:46.603 --> 00:02:48.144]  And that's essentially what we heard from
[00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:58.311]  Bear Brown when he was talking about his trial, how they kept out of evidence so many things that could have cleared him, but the judge just denied that from evidence.
[00:02:58.331 --> 00:03:06.060]  So he says, we no longer, and this is a quote from Bear Brown, he said, we no longer have a rule of law, we have a rule by law enforcement, or a rule of law enforcement.
[00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:08.742]  And that's the sad state of where we are.
[00:03:08.802 --> 00:03:12.765]  So we need to always question this narrative, and it's going to be interesting.
[00:03:12.805 --> 00:03:14.366]  We'll look at that in a little bit more detail.
[00:03:14.386 --> 00:03:20.710]  Of course, there's some new news about this bill in Texas that would come out in opposition to filming the cops.
[00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:29.516]  This is the same Texas representative who also introduced a bill to mandate psychological evaluations based on teacher recommendations.
[00:03:30.037 --> 00:03:36.241]  And if you didn't get your kid evaluated, if a teacher said send them to a psychiatrist, there were serious consequences for that.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.761]  We're going to talk about that.
[00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:41.304]  We're going to talk about the representative who keeps coming up with these insane bills.
[00:03:41.364 --> 00:03:43.206]  He's a Republican out of Dallas.
[00:03:43.686 --> 00:03:48.750]  But we have two stories that I think are very interesting and very telling about where we are.
[00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.454]  A university is requiring students to apply for free speech permits.
[00:03:53.294 --> 00:04:02.903]  At the same time, we see that the universities and the college loans are just squashing children under mountains of debt when they get out.
[00:04:03.871 --> 00:04:08.985]  We have to ask, you know, you're going to get out of college, in most cases you're going to be a debt slave.
[00:04:10.632 --> 00:04:13.253]  But you also need to have the mentality of a slave.
[00:04:13.293 --> 00:04:17.414]  And that's what they're working on in schools from K through 12 and even in college.
[00:04:17.454 --> 00:04:18.614]  And that's what this is about.
[00:04:18.654 --> 00:04:20.435]  Having students apply for free speech permits.
[00:04:20.455 --> 00:04:27.076]  We've had Dinesh D'Souza and many people talking about how illiberal the universities have become.
[00:04:27.116 --> 00:04:30.337]  And I mean that in the sense of the classical liberals.
[00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:35.859]  People in the 1800s called those who stood for liberty, they called them liberals.
[00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.300]  But that's not what liberal means now.
[00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:40.182]  It's basically very illiberal.
[00:04:40.222 --> 00:04:51.751]  We also have a clip from a city council meeting where a man who is a veteran is called an enemy of his country by the councilman because he said that he smoked pot.
[00:04:52.412 --> 00:04:53.853]  He was an enemy of the Constitution.
[00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:54.133]  Really?
[00:04:54.333 --> 00:04:55.194]  Who is the enemy?
[00:04:55.814 --> 00:04:56.255]  So stay with us.
[00:04:56.275 --> 00:05:00.278]  We're going to be right back and we're going to cover those stories as well as what's happening in the Middle East.
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.841]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:17.963]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.

[00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:39.930]  Alex Jones here.

[00:07:09.158 --> 00:07:10.058]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[00:07:10.118 --> 00:07:10.558]  Good, brother.
[00:07:10.678 --> 00:07:12.399]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:14.200]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.361]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:20.962]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:07:21.002 --> 00:07:23.242]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:07:23.422 --> 00:07:31.385]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:07:31.605 --> 00:07:34.710]  We did a super male and a super female vitality.
[00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.352]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:07:36.392 --> 00:07:40.799]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:46.888]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:07:47.128 --> 00:07:48.729]  Or maximum potency.
[00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:59.053]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going, goes right to the source.
[00:07:59.133 --> 00:08:00.854]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:08:00.914 --> 00:08:07.857]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.

[00:08:24.899 --> 00:08:26.679]  Another time.
[00:08:26.719 --> 00:08:30.821]  His life was green and good.
[00:08:30.881 --> 00:08:34.923]  Until the Christmas act.
[00:08:36.923 --> 00:08:40.865]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:41.545 --> 00:08:43.526]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:08:43.866 --> 00:08:45.607]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:08:46.287 --> 00:08:47.508]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.961]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday, April 1st.
[00:08:54.161 --> 00:08:54.901]  I'm David Knight.
[00:08:54.921 --> 00:08:55.742]  I'll be your host today.
[00:08:55.782 --> 00:08:58.163]  We're going to be joined in the second hour by Steve Quayle.
[00:08:58.183 --> 00:09:03.945]  And we're going to try to work out what's going on, what his opinion is about what's behind Jade Helm.
[00:09:03.985 --> 00:09:14.049]  And of course, with today being April Fool's Day, as I said in the last segment, we're always trying to figure out if the government is spoofing us or not, because we can never count on the government.
[00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:15.310]  We've caught them so many times
[00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.071]  Covering things up.
[00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:18.711]  Lying to us deliberately.
[00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:20.873]  Everything is a national secret.
[00:09:20.973 --> 00:09:22.533]  It's all about national security.
[00:09:23.034 --> 00:09:25.075]  So we can never get a straight answer from these guys.
[00:09:25.155 --> 00:09:28.697]  And usually we find out when they do give us a definitive answer that it's a lie.
[00:09:28.757 --> 00:09:34.720]  Just like we saw James Clapper giving the lie, looking down as he scrubbed his eyes.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.320]  He couldn't look.
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:45.943]  Uh, Ron Wyden in the eye, because he knew that Ron Wyden knew that James Clapper in the NSA was doing dragnet surveillance on everybody in violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
[00:09:46.903 --> 00:09:48.284]  He knew that the staffers all knew it.
[00:09:48.324 --> 00:09:50.164]  He knew that all the other senators knew it.
[00:09:50.184 --> 00:09:57.407]  So when Ron Wyden asked him a point-blank question, he just kind of looked down and, well... And, uh, we know that too.
[00:09:57.707 --> 00:09:59.247]  We know that too, Mr. Clapper.
[00:09:59.347 --> 00:10:00.728]  We know you guys are all lying to us.
[00:10:01.128 --> 00:10:02.768]  But it's just good to get it on tape once in a while.
[00:10:03.489 --> 00:10:04.349]  We're going to, uh...
[00:10:05.249 --> 00:10:07.290]  As I mentioned, have Steve Quayle join us in the second hour.
[00:10:07.331 --> 00:10:10.092]  He's going to talk about what he thinks is behind Jade Helm.
[00:10:10.112 --> 00:10:18.238]  And of course, there's been a lot of speculation about what this is, because you know it is not just an ordinary exercise.
[00:10:18.298 --> 00:10:19.759]  This is something that's going for two months.
[00:10:19.819 --> 00:10:21.280]  It's over a large range.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:27.283]  And I think, personally, we ought to be concerned about this, whether it is for domestic operation or not.
[00:10:27.303 --> 00:10:37.229]  I'm very concerned about the fact that they're going to have training, a large part of the training is to operate amongst the American people in civilian clothes to see if they can go undetected.
[00:10:38.413 --> 00:10:40.914]  I don't know why you would need to do that in a foreign country.
[00:10:40.934 --> 00:10:51.136]  If you're going to do that in America, if you're going to train that way in America, that would not help you in a foreign country as everybody's thinking they're going to go maybe to the Middle East or wherever they're going to go.
[00:10:51.957 --> 00:10:56.138]  But we have a lot of evidence that our government is also preparing for war in the Middle East.
[00:10:56.178 --> 00:10:58.158]  They're also preparing for war against the Russians.
[00:10:58.418 --> 00:11:00.299]  Are they preparing for war against the American people?
[00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:04.101]  Possibly the answer is all of the above, unfortunately.
[00:11:04.821 --> 00:11:09.664]  These guys think that they can go to war with everybody everywhere and they can still come out on top.
[00:11:10.464 --> 00:11:15.147]  Or maybe what they really want to do is get everybody fighting with each other.
[00:11:15.647 --> 00:11:18.629]  We have a speech that was made by the head of Stratfor.
[00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:22.571]  It's always interesting to get these speeches that were made at conferences because
[00:11:23.604 --> 00:11:32.046]  Many times these guys will make statements comfortable in this area and figure that nobody's ever going to look at these dry proceedings from a conference.
[00:11:32.126 --> 00:11:37.647]  And every once in a while you'll find these that somebody notices something in it and pulls it out.
[00:11:38.107 --> 00:11:41.368]  Usually they only get a couple hundred views and they post them on YouTube if they put them up there.
[00:11:42.348 --> 00:11:46.989]  It's kind of similar to what Petraeus did when he said, well, what comes after America?
[00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:48.349]  Well, that's simple, North America.
[00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:50.910]  We're 20 years in the North American Union.
[00:11:51.914 --> 00:11:56.962]  We had kind of a similar thing, I think, from a speech done by the Stratfor President, Friedman.
[00:11:57.824 --> 00:12:02.371]  And he was talking about the conflict in the Ukraine.
[00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:04.995]  We're going to play some excerpts from that.
[00:12:05.115 --> 00:12:12.945]  I think it gives a real insight into the mindset of these people and I think it raises some real troubling questions for us.
[00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:22.036]  The video was actually posted with German subtitles by somebody in Germany because he talks a great deal about Germany and Russia to give you kind of a preview.
[00:12:22.777 --> 00:12:29.380]  He says that for the last 100 years, the existential threat to America has been to keep Germany and Russia apart from each other.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.822]  To keep them from unifying, because we could not control that.
[00:12:32.962 --> 00:12:35.723]  The British and the Americans could not control that power base.
[00:12:36.304 --> 00:12:37.784]  So we need to keep them separate.
[00:12:38.345 --> 00:12:40.546]  That is an existential threat to us, he says.
[00:12:41.146 --> 00:12:48.550]  But then he also goes on to point out that if we get into the Ukraine, the Russians consider that to be an existential threat.
[00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:53.197]  So here you've got two conflicting existential threats is what he's saying.
[00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.191]  So we're going to talk about that.
[00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:58.813]  We're also going to have another look at Jade Helm.
[00:12:58.913 --> 00:13:02.276]  We've talked about the troubling domestic implications for this.
[00:13:04.477 --> 00:13:07.860]  We're very concerned, like I said, about the people moving about as civilians.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.342]  We've also seen the training facility at AP Hill.
[00:13:11.462 --> 00:13:23.131]  There's others throughout the country and other military bases where they have created replicas of American cities, not European cities, not Middle Eastern cities, American cities, and they train there.
[00:13:23.911 --> 00:13:25.012]  They train the military there.
[00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:28.175]  They train police there to act as military.
[00:13:28.255 --> 00:13:30.116]  That's something we should all be very concerned.
[00:13:30.957 --> 00:13:34.139]  But Watson had an interesting take on this map.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:43.287]  We've had a couple of veterans who contacted us and said that they think that Jade Helm is preparation for an Iranian invasion or an Iranian and Syrian invasion.
[00:13:43.387 --> 00:13:46.530]  So we're going to play Watson's report on that later on.
[00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:47.891]  And of course there's been other stuff that
[00:13:48.331 --> 00:13:53.175]  People are saying, what's going on with these nationwide emergency alert tests?
[00:13:53.876 --> 00:13:54.677]  People are panicked.
[00:13:54.717 --> 00:13:55.457]  They're confused.
[00:13:55.477 --> 00:13:59.581]  It was one that went quite a long time on the East Coast.
[00:14:00.181 --> 00:14:01.983]  Yesterday, I think it was, or the day before.
[00:14:02.043 --> 00:14:03.604]  We have Paul's article about this.
[00:14:03.645 --> 00:14:05.006]  He posted it on the 31st.
[00:14:06.187 --> 00:14:08.669]  It was, yeah, it was yesterday morning.
[00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.931]  We're going to talk about what's behind that.
[00:14:11.571 --> 00:14:14.294]  But before we do that, I want to get into this video.
[00:14:14.314 --> 00:14:15.335]  This is a veteran.
[00:14:15.973 --> 00:14:21.076]  Who came back and spoke at a video, at a county, a city meeting.
[00:14:22.116 --> 00:14:24.237]  And he was speaking about medical marijuana.
[00:14:24.277 --> 00:14:28.299]  He was speaking to a city official in Maricopa County.
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:29.400]  He was an attorney.
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:35.083]  And of course, Maricopa is where Sheriff Joe Arpaio is.
[00:14:36.204 --> 00:14:38.745]  And he had some comments.
[00:14:38.845 --> 00:14:41.847]  Let's play this video and then we'll talk about what they had to say.
[00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:46.215]  Thank you for your service.
[00:14:46.235 --> 00:14:49.098]  I'm a Vietnam veteran myself.
[00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:51.840]  Today is a special day for me.
[00:14:52.541 --> 00:14:57.265]  I will ask you questions, be more of a statement, or anything.
[00:14:57.285 --> 00:15:04.452]  48 years ago today, I had the honor and privilege of commissioning a United States historian called the USS Sample.
[00:15:05.212 --> 00:15:07.915]  We used to tell people that we were the best
[00:15:11.298 --> 00:15:15.722]  Today I was also honored in Sun City, we're doing marijuana education.
[00:15:16.683 --> 00:15:21.747]  And I was honored to share a sample of the best medication on this planet for the elderly.
[00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:23.269]  We've seen results.
[00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:28.353]  And with all due respect, sir, your name-calling potheads, they offends me.
[00:15:29.294 --> 00:15:30.655]  A lot of name-calling offends me.
[00:15:30.755 --> 00:15:31.456]  When we came home
[00:15:45.209 --> 00:15:48.252]  And I'd like to spend some time with you sometime.
[00:15:48.292 --> 00:15:50.854]  The name you're going to call me right now is Healthy.
[00:15:51.715 --> 00:15:53.136]  I've been a patient for four years.
[00:15:53.836 --> 00:15:55.618]  I've got all my prescription drugs.
[00:15:56.599 --> 00:15:58.240]  I've got the doctor's report to prove it.
[00:15:59.281 --> 00:16:02.524]  And I'd love for you to join us Monday from noon to two.
[00:16:03.124 --> 00:16:04.405]  Coco's in Sun City.
[00:16:05.306 --> 00:16:07.548]  And we'll educate y'all.
[00:16:07.928 --> 00:16:08.569]  I feel sorry for you.
[00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:16.634]  Okay, now this is the reply from the county attorney.
[00:16:16.654 --> 00:16:22.018]  You said when I said at the beginning that there is a distinction between medicinal applications and recreational use.
[00:16:22.419 --> 00:16:23.840]  I'm a recreational user.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.521]  Well, then you're violating the law.
[00:16:26.081 --> 00:16:28.063]  And I have no respect for you.
[00:16:28.143 --> 00:16:37.530]  And I have no respect for you so that I would try to claim that you served this country and took an oath to uphold the Constitution and defend against all enemies born in the Mesa because you're an idiot.
[00:16:41.161 --> 00:16:43.282]  And the people are booing him, as they should.
[00:16:44.322 --> 00:16:47.843]  He says, well, if you use it recreationally, I have no respect for you.
[00:16:47.883 --> 00:16:48.964]  You're violating the law.
[00:16:49.004 --> 00:17:01.748]  He says, I have no respect for someone, this is the Maricopa County attorney saying this, I have no respect for someone who would try to claim you serve this country and took an oath to uphold the Constitution and protect all enemies, foreign and domestic, because you're an enemy.
[00:17:02.568 --> 00:17:03.029]  You're an enemy.
[00:17:03.249 --> 00:17:08.130]  You're an enemy if you don't go along with the war on drugs that was created by the United Nations.
[00:17:08.831 --> 00:17:09.451]  Understand that.
[00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:16.264]  Ten years before Richard Nixon, actually nine years before he declared it in 1970.
[00:17:17.485 --> 00:17:21.829]  Nine years before, in 61, the United Nations came up with the four schedules that we have now for drugs.
[00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:24.331]  They came up with a template, with an agenda.
[00:17:25.191 --> 00:17:28.674]  They enacted that and declared war on drugs ten years later.
[00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:30.116]  This is a UN agenda.
[00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:33.839]  And it is something that has failed for over 40 years.
[00:17:33.879 --> 00:17:34.679]  We need to understand that.
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.441]  But who is the enemy of the Constitution?
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.884]  I would say this county attorney is the enemy of the Constitution, not the other man.
[00:17:43.125 --> 00:17:50.892]  The 9th and the 10th and the 18th and the 21st Amendments make it clear that they don't have the right to outlaw this.
[00:17:51.113 --> 00:17:52.414]  They haven't done what they need to do.
[00:17:53.154 --> 00:18:01.082]  The 9th and the 10th Amendment make it clear that just because we don't specifically mention something like the right to keep and bear arms, which they also don't respect,
[00:18:01.838 --> 00:18:03.740]  Or free speech, which they also don't respect.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:09.844]  Just because we don't specifically mention that doesn't mean that those rights are not important, doesn't mean that we don't retain those rights.
[00:18:10.505 --> 00:18:12.906]  That the states and the individuals don't retain those rights.
[00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:13.947]  That's the 9th and 10th Amendment.
[00:18:14.247 --> 00:18:19.732]  Then the 18th Amendment, in respect of that, they said, well, we want to ban alcohol for whatever idiotic reason.
[00:18:19.772 --> 00:18:21.353]  We know that drug prohibition did not work.
[00:18:22.239 --> 00:18:26.420]  That it made everything far worse because it wasn't the way to handle the problem.
[00:18:26.801 --> 00:18:28.141]  And alcoholism is a problem.
[00:18:28.301 --> 00:18:28.981]  I understand that.
[00:18:29.301 --> 00:18:30.602]  But it's a spiritual problem.
[00:18:30.682 --> 00:18:32.002]  It's a psychological problem.
[00:18:32.082 --> 00:18:33.883]  It is not a law enforcement problem.
[00:18:34.843 --> 00:18:35.623]  That does not work.
[00:18:36.264 --> 00:18:44.226]  But the 18th Amendment came in and said, alright, we don't have the authority to ban alcohol, so we're going to amend the Constitution so that we specifically have the power to ban this particular substance.
[00:18:44.266 --> 00:18:46.307]  And the 21st Amendment rolled that back.
[00:18:47.475 --> 00:18:51.582]  So they have to have constitutional permission to do this and they don't have that.
[00:18:51.662 --> 00:18:53.265]  So the real enemy of the Constitution...
[00:18:54.332 --> 00:19:01.518]  Are the quote-unquote law enforcement and attorneys and the counties who are putting people in jail.
[00:19:01.779 --> 00:19:03.660]  They're the real enemies of the Constitution.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.922]  They're the ones who have really violated their oath.
[00:19:06.523 --> 00:19:09.605]  And an attorney should know better.
[00:19:09.645 --> 00:19:13.168]  We have talked many times to law enforcement against prohibition.
[00:19:13.188 --> 00:19:21.476]  It's attorneys, it is law enforcement, most of them are former, some of them are active, as well as judges who realize
[00:19:22.216 --> 00:19:25.300]  A, this isn't working, and B, this is destroying our country.
[00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:27.724]  But let's talk about the free speech part of it.
[00:19:28.485 --> 00:19:29.666]  You know, we should have...
[00:19:30.805 --> 00:19:34.746]  That held without any laws being made, that should be sacrosanct.
[00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:41.688]  And certainly in an institution of higher learning, like a university, you would think that they would understand the importance of free speech.
[00:19:42.369 --> 00:19:46.890]  The importance of hearing everyone's side of this, and having an open debate.
[00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.291]  I mean, isn't that what higher education is supposed to be about?
[00:19:49.351 --> 00:19:56.493]  Isn't it supposed to be about holding up ideas, examining these things, and having a debate about them, and letting the best ideas come forth?
[00:19:57.635 --> 00:19:59.256]  Not in our modern universities.
[00:19:59.857 --> 00:20:03.519]  Not in the ones where you're going to come out massively as a slave debt.
[00:20:03.559 --> 00:20:05.160]  We're going to talk about that story when we come back.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.600]  Stay with us.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.101]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:09.648 --> 00:20:10.528]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:20:10.568 --> 00:20:10.989]  Good, brother.
[00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:12.829]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:20:13.089 --> 00:20:14.650]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.832]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:20:18.852 --> 00:20:19.572]  Well, thank you, brother.
[00:20:19.592 --> 00:20:23.694]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:20:23.894 --> 00:20:31.857]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:20:32.097 --> 00:20:35.161]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:20:35.301 --> 00:20:36.803]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:20:36.843 --> 00:20:41.228]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[00:20:41.528 --> 00:20:46.954]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:20:46.994 --> 00:20:47.615]  We're good to go.
[00:21:09.346 --> 00:21:16.192]  By now you know that wireless technology like cell phones do in fact pose dangers to the health and privacy of everyone.

[00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:40.311]  It's happening again.
[00:21:40.391 --> 00:21:43.592]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:47.194]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[00:21:47.414 --> 00:21:51.256]  378, will take away your right to buy Level 3 and higher body armor.
[00:21:51.496 --> 00:21:56.478]  Katie Armor offers the most affordable Level 3 body armor packages on the market today.
[00:21:56.998 --> 00:21:57.919]  Protect yourself.
[00:21:58.099 --> 00:22:01.080]  Buy your body armor now, before it's too late.

[00:22:02.881 --> 00:22:05.302]  That's K-A-T-I-A-R-M-O-R.com.
[00:22:05.882 --> 00:22:06.943]  Come and take it.
[00:22:09.181 --> 00:22:10.041]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:22:10.202 --> 00:22:15.524]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:22:15.724 --> 00:22:16.145]  I get it.
[00:22:16.265 --> 00:22:25.609]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:22:25.869 --> 00:22:27.050]  That's not what's happening.
[00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:35.474]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:22:35.714 --> 00:22:38.936]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:22:39.076 --> 00:22:43.159]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:22:43.319 --> 00:22:44.880]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.143]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:22:48.883 --> 00:22:52.486]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:22:52.666 --> 00:22:53.387]  You should, too.
[00:22:53.587 --> 00:22:54.548]  Find out what they know.
[00:22:54.728 --> 00:22:58.010]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:58.070]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:58.371]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:58.431 --> 00:22:58.611]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:08.106 --> 00:23:11.089]  Don't complain about your cable bill going up and up and up.
[00:23:11.209 --> 00:23:12.271]  Do something about it.

[00:24:25.745 --> 00:24:32.150]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this April 1st, and we actually have a promotion, a no-fooling promotion.
[00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:37.574]  Through Friday of this week, you'll get free shipping on anything you buy at the InfoWars store.
[00:24:37.634 --> 00:24:50.004]  We have, and usually we're talking about the health products that we have there at InfoWars Live, but also at InfoWars store, we have items that are going to help you push out into the free speech area.
[00:24:50.044 --> 00:24:51.865]  We've got the 1776 and the Mulan Lave shirts.
[00:24:55.208 --> 00:25:02.457]  Just as we were talking about in the previous segment, that they're trying to suppress freedom of speech at the universities.
[00:25:03.018 --> 00:25:07.403]  This is one way that you can get out there and engage people, even if you're not at a university.
[00:25:07.423 --> 00:25:10.287]  Especially if you're not at a university, because universities are going to censor you.
[00:25:10.307 --> 00:25:11.589]  They're going to try to anyway.
[00:25:11.969 --> 00:25:12.329]  But this is
[00:25:30.058 --> 00:25:33.300]  Maybe think that they know what we're about, but don't really know what we're about.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:40.625]  You can kind of help explain to them what's going on here, but certainly it's an opportunity for you to start to engage people in a conversation.
[00:25:40.665 --> 00:25:46.429]  Again, you can get free shipping through the end of the week at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:25:46.469 --> 00:25:49.271]  That's our no-fooling free shipping special.
[00:25:49.991 --> 00:25:55.075]  Now going back to the story that we just started talking about just before the break, this is up on InfoWars.com from Kit Daniels.
[00:25:55.115 --> 00:25:58.157]  University requires students to apply for free speech permits.
[00:25:58.956 --> 00:26:04.361]  The content of student handouts must also be reviewed and approved by the school officials.
[00:26:04.401 --> 00:26:08.025]  This is at California Polytechnic State University in Pomona.
[00:26:08.545 --> 00:26:17.474]  They are now requiring students to engage in free speech activities on campus to apply for permits to be issued between weekdays, between the hours of 8 and 5.
[00:26:18.115 --> 00:26:21.117]  So you not only have a free speech permit,
[00:26:22.165 --> 00:26:25.186]  You've also got a free speech time window that you can put.
[00:26:25.226 --> 00:26:31.427]  Remember when they went out to the Bundy Ranch and they put this little cordon area out in the middle of nowhere?
[00:26:31.467 --> 00:26:36.568]  I mean, it was so far away from anywhere where anybody would ever see you.
[00:26:36.588 --> 00:26:42.650]  Of course, that's what they do at the Republican and the Democrat conventions, where they pick their presidential candidates.
[00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:46.371]  And they've done that for the last several cycles, setting up free speech areas.
[00:26:47.156 --> 00:27:00.291]  Anybody who wants to exercise their constitutional rights to demonstrate in public peacefully, to redress their grievances that they have with the government, those people at the political conventions, they get put into cages.
[00:27:01.189 --> 00:27:05.251]  That are many, many blocks away from where the convention is being held.
[00:27:05.291 --> 00:27:15.877]  If you get out of your cage, your free speech cage, you get arrested, you get beaten, you get tasered or maced or whatever the police feel like they want to do that day.
[00:27:16.397 --> 00:27:22.160]  So, this is something that is now being promoted in the universities, like California Polytechnic State.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:34.568]  They say that if you're going to hand out flyers, you not only have to get a free speech permit, but you also need to get approval from school officials over the content, so that you can then go to the free speech zone.
[00:27:34.588 --> 00:27:35.088]  You know what?
[00:27:35.208 --> 00:27:46.555]  At Bundy Ranch, they had this orange fence there, and they had a sign that was printed up very nicely by the BLM, professionally printed up sign, said, free speech area.
[00:27:46.956 --> 00:27:51.699]  And somebody did a handwritten zone and said, First Amendment isn't an area.
[00:27:52.728 --> 00:27:53.548]  And that's said it all.
[00:27:54.169 --> 00:28:00.112]  Now, of course, at Polytechnic State University in California, they're going to have to check in with the Office of Student Life.
[00:28:00.132 --> 00:28:02.773]  They're going to have to allow the school to copy their IDs.
[00:28:03.073 --> 00:28:04.053]  See, they're intimidating you.
[00:28:04.994 --> 00:28:06.495]  And then you're going to have to wear badges.
[00:28:07.526 --> 00:28:11.567]  I don't need no stinking badges to get my free speech out there.
[00:28:12.028 --> 00:28:15.489]  And then the Office of Student Life must approve all flyers and posters.
[00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:20.871]  They say that last fall, Kit points out officials at Dixie State University from St.
[00:28:20.891 --> 00:28:25.872]  George, Utah refused to allow Libertarian students to hand out flyers that were poking fun at U.S.
[00:28:25.932 --> 00:28:29.273]  presidents because the campus forbids mocking.
[00:28:30.714 --> 00:28:32.715]  Political correctness, that just trumps everything.
[00:28:32.775 --> 00:28:36.096]  So those students are replying with a lawsuit.
[00:28:36.116 --> 00:28:36.436]  But you know,
[00:28:37.651 --> 00:28:42.493]  If you go to school today and to college, you're going to wind up massively in debt.
[00:28:42.833 --> 00:28:45.634]  They want you to have the mindset of a slave as well.
[00:28:45.674 --> 00:28:46.915]  That's what that training is about.
[00:28:47.355 --> 00:28:48.976]  But you will have the debt of a slave.
[00:28:49.016 --> 00:28:51.677]  You will be an indentured servant to the state.
[00:28:51.717 --> 00:28:54.238]  You will not be able to get rid of that loan.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:55.460]  I don't know.
[00:29:16.138 --> 00:29:17.918]  Here's four key points.
[00:29:17.938 --> 00:29:21.379]  They say 40 million Americans are now in debt because of student loans.
[00:29:21.599 --> 00:29:25.540]  On average, borrowers have four loans with a balance of $29,000.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:35.962]  Student loans have the highest delinquency rate of any household credit, and it's the second highest category of personal debt.
[00:29:36.002 --> 00:29:44.704]  And they say only 37% of student loan balances are current with their repayment and not delinquent.
[00:29:45.724 --> 00:29:48.246]  It's a massive debt that's being imposed on people.
[00:29:48.666 --> 00:29:49.666]  Some majors are great.
[00:29:49.726 --> 00:29:57.591]  Sometimes, if you're going to be a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer, you need to go to college, but many of these degrees are not going to pay for the loan itself.
[00:29:57.631 --> 00:29:58.011]  Stay with us.
[00:29:58.151 --> 00:29:58.711]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:58.731 --> 00:29:59.512]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.032 --> 00:30:01.613]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:05.235]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.696 --> 00:30:15.839]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:18.560]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:25.382]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:30:25.643 --> 00:30:28.504]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:30:28.644 --> 00:30:31.565]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:30:31.585 --> 00:30:33.586]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:30:33.606 --> 00:30:36.427]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:30:36.527 --> 00:30:42.029]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:30:42.249 --> 00:30:45.751]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:30:45.771 --> 00:30:48.752]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:30:48.852 --> 00:30:55.955]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:30:56.175 --> 00:30:59.216]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:31:09.381 --> 00:31:14.403]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:31:14.523 --> 00:31:20.406]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:31:20.646 --> 00:31:25.269]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:31:25.429 --> 00:31:28.750]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:31:29.011 --> 00:31:30.591]  No needles, no injections.
[00:31:30.971 --> 00:31:33.953]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now.
[00:31:34.353 --> 00:31:35.374]  We're good to go.
[00:32:01.576 --> 00:32:04.177]  In our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:04.317 --> 00:32:07.698]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:32:07.878 --> 00:32:09.958]  The experts are clear.
[00:32:10.278 --> 00:32:17.240]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:22.542]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:23.642 --> 00:32:27.263]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary nascent iodine formula.
[00:32:27.383 --> 00:32:31.284]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:32:31.604 --> 00:32:36.626]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:32:36.906 --> 00:32:37.826]  Not our iodine.
[00:32:37.926 --> 00:32:41.507]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:32:41.727 --> 00:32:44.087]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:33:18.486 --> 00:33:25.852]  Matter of fact, it's safe to say that they would rather switch... ...than fight!
[00:33:26.332 --> 00:33:28.033]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.454 --> 00:33:29.915]  Because there is a war on.
[00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:31.236]  For your mind.
[00:33:35.325 --> 00:33:36.446]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:36.546 --> 00:33:37.187]  I'm David Nice.
[00:33:37.427 --> 00:33:40.990]  As I mentioned earlier in the show, we're going to have Steve Quayle joining us in the next hour.
[00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:45.054]  He's going to talk about what he believes is going on with Jade Helm.
[00:33:45.394 --> 00:33:46.355]  We don't really know.
[00:33:46.716 --> 00:33:48.137]  We know there's an exercise going on.
[00:33:48.177 --> 00:33:49.678]  We know it's very large, extensive.
[00:33:49.698 --> 00:33:54.203]  We know that the government has been training with replicas of American cities.
[00:33:54.263 --> 00:33:58.366]  But we know that the government is also involved in many foreign wars.
[00:33:58.847 --> 00:34:00.568]  All of those things are a problem, aren't they?
[00:34:01.249 --> 00:34:09.892]  I mean, even if they were going to only use this to start a massive new Middle Eastern war, only if, wouldn't that still be a problem?
[00:34:11.072 --> 00:34:14.693]  Can't we have a discussion about the scope of our government?
[00:34:14.993 --> 00:34:20.415]  And of course, one of the things we should be concerned about is the war on drugs, which literally is a war.
[00:34:20.455 --> 00:34:24.536]  This is a story from The Nation that we have on Infowars.com.
[00:34:24.556 --> 00:34:25.096]  The U.S.'
[00:34:25.056 --> 00:34:27.877]  's war on drugs has spiraled dangerously out of control, you think?
[00:34:28.746 --> 00:34:31.338]  It's been this way for a long time, but here's the case that they make.
[00:34:32.025 --> 00:34:34.927]  They talk about people being beheaded by the hundreds.
[00:34:36.307 --> 00:34:41.130]  Headless, handless bodies along the roadsides as a warning to those who would resist their power.
[00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:45.712]  They have penetrated the local state and national governments and control entire sections of the country.
[00:34:46.193 --> 00:34:54.917]  They provide employment and services to an impoverished public which distrusts their actual government with its bitter record of corruption, repression, and torture.
[00:34:54.977 --> 00:34:59.480]  They seduce young people from several countries, including the U.S., into their murderous activities.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.423]  Are we talking about ISIS or ISIL or IS?
[00:35:03.903 --> 00:35:04.164]  No.
[00:35:04.644 --> 00:35:07.347]  They're talking about the Mexican drug cartels.
[00:35:08.307 --> 00:35:09.869]  A huge number of people killed.
[00:35:10.029 --> 00:35:13.932]  I think the last time I saw it, I don't know what their count is here.
[00:35:13.972 --> 00:35:21.719]  Many people have different casualty counts, but it's certainly over 100,000 people have died in this war on drugs.
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:23.801]  This is a real war.
[00:35:24.687 --> 00:35:27.509]  This is a real war that could come to America.
[00:35:27.549 --> 00:35:29.030]  We need to be concerned about this.
[00:35:29.511 --> 00:35:37.157]  And we don't need to be concerned about it in the way that we erect some kind of a fortress on the border or that we turn ourselves into an armed police state.
[00:35:37.277 --> 00:35:42.080]  No, the armed police state is what is encouraging this kind of war.
[00:35:42.901 --> 00:35:43.281]  The U.S.
[00:35:43.301 --> 00:35:44.801]  war on drugs really is a war.
[00:35:44.861 --> 00:35:45.962]  It's a war on our freedom.
[00:35:46.282 --> 00:35:49.602]  It's a war on everything that our government has been based on.
[00:35:49.662 --> 00:35:52.223]  It's something we should all be very, very concerned about.
[00:35:52.563 --> 00:36:04.465]  And we need to be concerned about a government that will not tell us the truth, that will not be candid with us, that will say that everything is national security, or I'm not going to comply with this order or that one.
[00:36:04.805 --> 00:36:05.605]  Here's a good example.
[00:36:06.405 --> 00:36:07.745]  This is something from the Weekly Standard.
[00:36:07.785 --> 00:36:10.186]  Homeland Security head threatens to defy subpoenas.
[00:36:10.768 --> 00:36:19.038]  Now these are subpoenas that are coming from Chairman Jason Chaffetz of the House Committee Oversight and Government Reform.
[00:36:19.359 --> 00:36:27.348]  They wanted to know about these Secret Service agents and the incidents that happened there, where they had these drunken Secret Service agents hit the gate and everything.
[00:36:27.388 --> 00:36:28.410]  They were not shot, of course.
[00:36:29.691 --> 00:36:36.759]  You know, the lesson here is if you want to make sure that you're not going to get shot in Washington, dress up like a Secret Service agent.
[00:36:36.799 --> 00:36:38.141]  Look like the men in black.
[00:36:38.201 --> 00:36:39.863]  Don't wear a dress, okay?
[00:36:39.903 --> 00:36:41.585]  This is what happened to these two guys the other day.
[00:36:41.605 --> 00:36:47.091]  Because we'd already seen that they shot the lady with a baby in the back without thinking twice about it.
[00:36:47.191 --> 00:36:48.893]  Similar situation hitting the barrier.
[00:36:49.534 --> 00:36:52.059]  But they wanted to find out what's going on with the Secret Service.
[00:36:52.099 --> 00:36:55.565]  There's been some tremendous laxes in security.
[00:36:55.605 --> 00:37:01.857]  So they subpoenaed a couple of Secret Service agents and these guys did not show up.
[00:37:02.748 --> 00:37:10.694]  Okay, Secret Service Director Clancy had gone back on a promise to make the two unarmed agents available to be interviewed by the Congressional Committee.
[00:37:11.295 --> 00:37:14.698]  So they sent subpoenas to Homeland Security.
[00:37:14.818 --> 00:37:30.350]  And within hours, get this, talk about not seeing the contradiction here, Homeland Security Secretary Jay Johnson fired back a sharply worded statement denying the charges of uncooperativeness along with a bail threat to defy the subpoenas.
[00:37:32.824 --> 00:37:38.602]  So, he's not going to, how dare you call me uncooperative, but he's not going to show up.
[00:37:39.414 --> 00:37:40.575]  They're not going to comply with these.
[00:37:41.856 --> 00:37:42.916]  But he's not uncooperative.
[00:37:43.396 --> 00:37:48.740]  This is the kind of just over-the-top lying that we see from officials all the time.
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:52.002]  This attitude that they are not responsible.
[00:37:52.042 --> 00:37:54.143]  This administration is not accountable.
[00:37:54.263 --> 00:37:56.465]  It can't be balanced by anyone or anything.
[00:37:56.505 --> 00:37:57.585]  They're going to do whatever they want.
[00:37:57.645 --> 00:38:00.207]  It doesn't matter what the Congress wants.
[00:38:00.247 --> 00:38:01.848]  It doesn't matter what the Constitution says.
[00:38:01.888 --> 00:38:03.409]  It doesn't matter what the laws are.
[00:38:03.929 --> 00:38:06.050]  They're going to do whatever they wish.
[00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:08.252]  And they're not going to be held accountable to anyone.
[00:38:08.692 --> 00:38:11.795]  I thought it was kind of interesting, Nico gave me this story from Gawker.
[00:38:12.856 --> 00:38:18.101]  They actually called some questions about Hillary Clinton's actions with this email situation.
[00:38:19.042 --> 00:38:23.046]  And they pointed out that she had sent an email, and here's the subject of the email.
[00:38:23.666 --> 00:38:28.691]  She sent it to Huma, and it was regarding Pakistan troops battle Taliban for U.S.
[00:38:28.771 --> 00:38:29.572]  drone debris.
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:37.426]  And then, uh, that was an email and she returned that and she said, uh, I like the idea of these, uh, how high are they?
[00:38:37.967 --> 00:38:39.288]  What would the bench be made of?
[00:38:39.408 --> 00:38:42.851]  And I'd prefer two shelves or attractive boxes, baskets, containers on one.
[00:38:42.871 --> 00:38:43.372]  What do you think?
[00:38:44.401 --> 00:38:48.722]  And she sent this back and she said, did you send this to me?
[00:38:48.742 --> 00:38:51.903]  In other words, here's a couple of different ways you can look at this.
[00:38:52.063 --> 00:39:00.904]  Either Hillary Clinton, and this is the take of Gawker, their take on it was she's not able to keep these accounts separate.
[00:39:00.925 --> 00:39:04.545]  She's got supposedly personal accounts and she's got State Department accounts.
[00:39:05.585 --> 00:39:12.367]  If she could send back a personal reply saying this is what I would like for my furnishings,
[00:39:12.947 --> 00:39:20.231]  To somebody who had just sent her an email about Pakistan troops battling the Taliban for U.S.
[00:39:20.871 --> 00:39:21.752]  drone debris.
[00:39:22.452 --> 00:39:26.974]  If she could send something back that is a personal thing about, you know, let's buy that table.
[00:39:27.775 --> 00:39:37.320]  Maybe if somebody is asking her about the table, she might send back some classified information of that person about what's going on with the Taliban.
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:41.222]  Of course, maybe she really was sending her code.
[00:39:42.856 --> 00:39:46.000]  Maybe that, you know, get that box and the extra lamp.
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:50.006]  Maybe that was something about, you know, ship some clandestine nukes over there.
[00:39:50.066 --> 00:39:50.386]  I don't know.
[00:39:50.406 --> 00:39:51.247]  I don't know.
[00:39:51.287 --> 00:39:52.008]  It's Hillary Clinton.
[00:39:52.149 --> 00:39:53.851]  Anything can happen with Hillary Clinton.
[00:39:54.912 --> 00:39:56.875]  Now, we want to go to...
[00:39:58.567 --> 00:40:16.097]  We're going to have a video that Paul Watson put out, because as we're talking about Jade Helm, and I don't know really what Steve Quayle's take is on this, and one of the things that's come out from a lot of military people is that this may be preparation for a war in the Middle East.
[00:40:17.277 --> 00:40:20.679]  So let's take a look at this video that Paul Watson's got.
[00:40:20.879 --> 00:40:27.103]  He lays out the possibility that maybe what they're doing is planning to attack Iran and Syria.
[00:40:28.516 --> 00:40:37.481]  The Jade Helm military exercise, set to take place in nine US states this summer, has prompted concerns about preparations for martial law in America.
[00:40:37.942 --> 00:40:46.127]  But could the real purpose behind the drill be centered around a mock invasion of Iran and Syria, and a huge Middle Eastern war?
[00:40:47.461 --> 00:41:00.110]  As we've exhaustively documented, these drills are clearly dual purpose, and there are plans in place to use the army in a law enforcement capacity to intern Americans during mass domestic unrest.
[00:41:00.831 --> 00:41:14.321]  But as Sputnik News documents today, Jade Helm seems to be geared around a much more sinister project, namely, quote, a preparation for an invasion of Iran and a Middle East-wide war.
[00:41:15.626 --> 00:41:16.427]  Look at this map.
[00:41:16.487 --> 00:41:22.973]  You'll recognize it as being from the Jade Helm exercise documents, but it's been amended slightly.
[00:41:23.833 --> 00:41:29.899]  The image is rotated to represent the approximate position of countries within the Middle East.
[00:41:30.973 --> 00:41:48.582]  So instead of Texas, Utah, and a pocket of California being represented as hostile states, the rogue nations become Iran, Syria, and Palestine, with Iraq, currently under siege by ISIS, leaning hostile.
[00:41:49.182 --> 00:41:53.184]  Israel, Lebanon, and Turkey in blue are friendly states.
[00:41:54.545 --> 00:41:59.808]  The US states are also comparable in some ways to the Middle Eastern countries they represent.
[00:42:01.024 --> 00:42:04.126]  New Mexico has vast swathes of desert, like Iraq.
[00:42:04.967 --> 00:42:08.029]  Utah has both mountains and flatlands, like Syria.
[00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:13.453]  California generally has a more gentle Mediterranean climate, like Israel.
[00:42:14.414 --> 00:42:21.079]  Then look at the different operations that will be undertaken during Jade Helm, and the implications are alarming.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.484]  In Utah, the equivalent of Syria, there will be a huge mock battle located here,
[00:42:28.547 --> 00:42:31.908]  With the enemy being the army of a simulated country.
[00:42:32.288 --> 00:42:36.710]  Apply this to the Middle East, and we're talking about the Syrian army.
[00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:38.930]  Allies, of course, with Iran.
[00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:53.575]  Also during Jade Helm, two unidentified operational detachment groups will also be dispatched to the capital here, simulating a covert operation in Damascus, Syria.
[00:42:54.375 --> 00:43:03.461]  Being a permissive blue state, Colorado, or Turkey, would allow NATO and US forces to move through the area unimpeded.
[00:43:04.421 --> 00:43:09.604]  California, or Israel, is also listed as a permissive blue state.
[00:43:10.365 --> 00:43:21.032]  No deployments of troops are planned to California during Jade Helm, just as no US troops would need to enter Israel during an invasion of Iran and Syria.
[00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:35.885]  The insurgent pocket shown on the Jade Hell map probably represents the West Bank and the coastal Gaza Strip, although it could also represent Hezbollah forces in Lebanon who would oppose a US invasion of Iran.
[00:43:36.974 --> 00:43:52.530]  Arizona, or Jordan, will be the site of the Special Forces Operational Detachment Headquarters, ODH, and a Marine Corps site during Operation Jade Helm, simulating Jordan's capital, Amman.
[00:43:53.772 --> 00:43:59.193]  And, of course, the primary focus of Operation Jade Helm will, of course, be Texas.
[00:43:59.874 --> 00:44:12.137]  At least 17 Texan cities involved in the exercise, which, of course, tells us that the mock invasion of Iran is the centrepiece and the focus of this drill.
[00:44:13.263 --> 00:44:26.112]  So as you can see, the location, terrain, and operational activities that characterize Jade Helm can all be transposed onto a simulated invasion of the Middle East.
[00:44:26.992 --> 00:44:37.339]  As four-star General Wesley Clark revealed, after 9-11, the Pentagon rubber-stamped a plan to invade the entire Middle East, country by country.
[00:44:43.423 --> 00:44:44.945]  And Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz.
[00:44:44.965 --> 00:44:49.589]  I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the joint staff who used to work for me.
[00:44:49.609 --> 00:44:54.173]  And one of the generals called me and he said, sir, you gotta come in and talk to me a second.
[00:44:54.193 --> 00:44:55.054]  I said, well, you're too busy.
[00:44:55.074 --> 00:44:55.774]  He said, no, no.
[00:44:56.315 --> 00:45:00.719]  He says, we've made the decision we're going to war with Iraq.
[00:45:01.299 --> 00:45:03.181]  This was on or about the 20th of September.
[00:45:04.162 --> 00:45:05.703]  I said, we're going to war with Iraq?
[00:45:05.783 --> 00:45:06.164]  Why?
[00:45:08.085 --> 00:45:09.487]  He said, I don't know.
[00:45:11.365 --> 00:45:13.206]  He said, I guess they don't know what else to do.
[00:45:14.927 --> 00:45:19.669]  So, I said, well, did they find some information connecting Saddam to al-Qaeda?
[00:45:19.749 --> 00:45:21.050]  He said, no, no.
[00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:23.071]  He says, there's nothing new that way.
[00:45:23.191 --> 00:45:25.893]  They just made the decision to go to war with Iraq.
[00:45:26.413 --> 00:45:33.577]  He said, I guess it's like, we don't know what to do about terrorists, but we've got a good military and we can take down governments.
[00:45:33.937 --> 00:45:39.040]  And he said, I guess if the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail.
[00:45:40.643 --> 00:45:46.227]  So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan.
[00:45:46.267 --> 00:45:47.868]  I said, are we still going to war with Iraq?
[00:45:47.928 --> 00:45:49.309]  And he said, oh, it's worse than that.
[00:45:49.849 --> 00:45:57.574]  He said, he reached over on his desk, he picked up a piece of paper, he said, I just, he said, I just got this down from upstairs from the Secretary of Defense's office today.
[00:45:57.614 --> 00:46:10.023]  And he said, this is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off Iran.
[00:46:10.883 --> 00:46:29.387]  With Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya already ticked off the list, does Operation Jade Helm signal that a US attack on Iran and Syria and a potentially devastating wider war throughout the region is coming sooner than we think?
[00:46:30.347 --> 00:46:32.407]  Check out the other videos, subscribe to the channel.
[00:46:32.567 --> 00:46:34.608]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson for InfoWars.com
[00:46:35.754 --> 00:46:36.555]  Interesting report.
[00:46:36.575 --> 00:46:42.299]  And we're going to be talking to Steve Quayle to get his take on what he thinks is behind Jade Helm.
[00:46:42.319 --> 00:46:43.580]  And of course, we never know.
[00:46:44.341 --> 00:46:46.002]  Because the government will not talk to us.
[00:46:46.042 --> 00:46:52.465]  But we do know, as Wesley Clark pointed out, that they're working to take down seven countries throughout the Middle East in five years.
[00:46:52.485 --> 00:46:53.085]  That was a plan.
[00:46:53.125 --> 00:46:58.267]  It may not be on schedule, but do you have any doubt that that's still what they want to do?
[00:46:58.687 --> 00:47:01.129]  And of course we know that they're pushing into the Ukraine.
[00:47:01.149 --> 00:47:08.572]  We're going to talk about what the Stratfor president said to a small group of people that's published up on a German site.
[00:47:09.172 --> 00:47:11.193]  And we know that they are training for the American people.
[00:47:11.213 --> 00:47:12.894]  They're training to go to war with everybody.
[00:47:13.374 --> 00:47:15.455]  So the question is, where are they spoofing us?
[00:47:15.475 --> 00:47:18.116]  We're going to talk a little bit more about that in just a moment.
[00:47:18.156 --> 00:47:24.819]  But you know, right now we have a special we are not fooling about, and that is a free shipping special through Friday.
[00:47:24.839 --> 00:47:27.760]  We call it the No Fooling Free Shipping Special up on our store.
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:29.581]  And we still have one more day.
[00:47:29.621 --> 00:47:34.383]  This is absolutely the last day Alex has extended for DNA Force.
[00:47:34.463 --> 00:47:38.425]  It's 30% off and just through the end of the show today.
[00:47:38.905 --> 00:47:41.526]  So you can get that as well as free shipping.
[00:47:41.546 --> 00:47:42.527]  And you know, when I look at that,
[00:47:43.482 --> 00:47:51.103]  This story that came out on InfoWars.com is up today about an Anglo-Saxon cow bile and garlic potion that kills MRSA.
[00:47:51.957 --> 00:47:55.978]  Okay, this is one of the superbugs that's going crazy in the hospitals.
[00:47:56.078 --> 00:48:07.862]  And so many times the scientists will say, well, you know, we don't, if it's not there with the guys in the white lab coats, that's what we're talking about with the hearings in North Carolina on medical marijuana.
[00:48:07.882 --> 00:48:17.245]  I'm just not going to entertain the idea, they said, that anything that hasn't come from a pharmaceutical company or been approved by the FDA can do anything.
[00:48:17.865 --> 00:48:20.607]  Well, we know that there are plenty of natural ingredients out there.
[00:48:20.627 --> 00:48:27.633]  And of course, if you're going to use cow bile and garlic potion, that's essentially trying to kill a bacteria that's there.
[00:48:27.673 --> 00:48:37.681]  That's kind of the same approach that the pharmaceutical companies take, which is to try to kill something that is a kill disease or stop disease after it's already started.
[00:48:37.701 --> 00:48:40.483]  Of course, there's another way to deal with that.
[00:48:40.523 --> 00:48:42.324]  That's the allopathic way to do it.
[00:48:42.364 --> 00:48:46.407]  There's another way to do that, and that is to build up your body's immune system.
[00:48:47.148 --> 00:48:47.428]  I don't know.
[00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:09.290]  175 studies, Nobel Prize winning studies.
[00:49:09.651 --> 00:49:16.914]  This is the thing that helps you to keep your cells healthy, to deal with the toxins that you're going to come in contact with.
[00:49:17.554 --> 00:49:24.117]  Not necessarily trying to fix something after it's broken, but trying to proactively help you to deal with things.
[00:49:24.177 --> 00:49:27.759]  That's exactly what they're trying to sell us when they sell us vaccines.
[00:49:28.339 --> 00:49:42.330]  The problem is that with the vaccines, they're sticking in all kinds of toxins at that moment, as well as adjuvants, things to irritate your immune system, because people's immune systems are typically so weakened by the toxins that they're already trying to deal with.
[00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:45.112]  So, the strategy that we try to take is to
[00:49:46.213 --> 00:49:55.955]  I think that's a much better strategy is to try to make your body as healthy as possible ahead of time so that can deal with these challenges as they come in because you can't filter everything out.
[00:49:56.035 --> 00:50:01.797]  You can't stop everything that's going to come at you in the water, in your food, in the environment.
[00:50:02.177 --> 00:50:04.997]  So the best thing you can do is to try to deal with that proactively.
[00:50:05.037 --> 00:50:07.038]  But I think it's still interesting when we look at this
[00:50:07.959 --> 00:50:10.481]  Anglo-Saxon cow bile and garlic potion.
[00:50:10.782 --> 00:50:17.890]  So many times people will disavow anything that doesn't come from the medical community.
[00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:20.893]  And here's a thousand-year-old medieval remedy.
[00:50:21.654 --> 00:50:27.541]  And we've been told many times that natural ingredients like garlic are very potent.
[00:50:28.061 --> 00:50:34.805]  We're attacking a lot of different bacteria as well as viruses, so I think that's a very interesting story.
[00:50:35.546 --> 00:50:44.452]  I'm surprised that there hasn't been more talk about that in the media, but I guess they don't really want you to avoid the big pharmaceutical products.
[00:50:44.812 --> 00:50:48.294]  Again, say it one more time, you get free shipping through Friday.
[00:50:48.814 --> 00:50:57.080]  We're going to be right back and we're going to talk about how willing people are to follow authority, especially when it comes from a computer.
[00:50:58.217 --> 00:51:04.040]  Many people will drive off of a bridge if the computer tells them to, and we're going to talk about the implications of that and autonomous cars.
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:05.741]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:51:09.663 --> 00:51:12.225]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:51:12.485 --> 00:51:17.368]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:51:17.608 --> 00:51:25.432]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed, and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:51:25.712 --> 00:51:30.034]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[00:51:30.234 --> 00:51:34.056]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:51:34.217 --> 00:51:39.920]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.941]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:51:43.321 --> 00:51:48.484]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:51:48.684 --> 00:51:58.628]  Go to MyPatriotsSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:51:59.548 --> 00:52:03.209]  That's 866-229-0927.

[00:52:09.272 --> 00:52:11.452]  So we decided to upgrade the look of our home.
[00:52:11.572 --> 00:52:13.153]  You know, improve the curve appeal.
[00:52:13.393 --> 00:52:15.934]  We decided to add the look of stone to the exterior.
[00:52:16.054 --> 00:52:18.055]  We really like the stacked stone look.
[00:52:18.295 --> 00:52:21.017]  Yeah, but when I checked into the price, it was ridiculous.
[00:52:21.237 --> 00:52:22.517]  No way could we afford it.
[00:52:22.617 --> 00:52:24.618]  Then a friend told me about Genstone.
[00:52:24.838 --> 00:52:27.039]  G-E-N-S-T-O-N-E.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.221]  Genstone comes in lightweight panels made of polyurethane.
[00:52:30.421 --> 00:52:33.222]  They've actually engineered the hassle out of installation.
[00:52:33.383 --> 00:52:34.403]  No mortar, no mesh.
[00:52:34.663 --> 00:52:35.223]  It was easy.
[00:52:35.544 --> 00:52:36.384]  Even I could do it.
[00:52:36.604 --> 00:52:39.466]  We just screwed the panels to the wall and it looks like stone.
[00:52:39.586 --> 00:52:41.367]  I mean it really looks like stone.
[00:52:41.508 --> 00:52:43.589]  Yeah, from the box to the wall in minutes.
[00:52:43.689 --> 00:52:45.450]  We love the look of our home now.
[00:52:45.731 --> 00:52:51.495]  And Genstone is durable, comes with a 25-year warranty, and offers additional R-Value for insulation.
[00:52:51.775 --> 00:52:55.578]  If you want the look of stone at a price you can afford, call Genstone.
[00:52:57.199 --> 00:52:58.580]  855-955-STONE.

[00:53:04.705 --> 00:53:06.987]  That's 855-955-7866.
[00:53:08.809 --> 00:53:12.212]  Last year, in the Nevada desert, one family took a stand for freedom.
[00:53:12.632 --> 00:53:16.896]  Numana Food Storage was the first and only company to support the rights of the Bundys.
[00:53:17.136 --> 00:53:23.043]  While others stood down, New Mana took donations and provided storable foods to the men at Bunkerville.
[00:53:23.583 --> 00:53:30.131]  Founded by patriots who believe in liberty, New Mana Food Storage is GMO-free, great tasting, and easy to prepare.
[00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:31.292]  Food is freedom!

[00:53:38.931 --> 00:53:39.491]  Hear that?
[00:53:40.132 --> 00:53:44.434]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:53:45.515 --> 00:53:47.917]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:53:48.457 --> 00:53:51.519]  You can prevent being the next victim of a break-in.

[00:54:23.435 --> 00:54:33.418]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on April 1st, 2015.
[00:54:33.458 --> 00:54:37.099]  I think this is an appropriate story for April 1st.
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:39.160]  It's a tragic story.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:48.963]  I mean, there's a lot that is funny and amusing about it, but the problem is this couple that drove off the bridge
[00:54:50.171 --> 00:54:54.155]  The wife died, and the man is in serious condition.
[00:54:54.916 --> 00:55:05.066]  And I'm not making fun of that, but we need to think about the many times you've heard your parents say, well, if Joe told you to do such and such, told you to jump off a bridge, would you do it?
[00:55:05.126 --> 00:55:06.947]  Or to jump off the dock, would you do it?
[00:55:08.409 --> 00:55:14.134]  The computer told this couple in the car to jump off the bridge, and they did it.
[00:55:15.006 --> 00:55:19.073]  Now they fell 38 feet, the man survived, but the wife did not.
[00:55:19.194 --> 00:55:20.055]  Very sad story.
[00:55:20.456 --> 00:55:21.798]  But here's the thing about this.
[00:55:23.203 --> 00:55:28.526]  Because the GPS navigation was telling them to go down this road, even though, listen to the way this was marked.
[00:55:28.566 --> 00:55:38.992]  They said the Kline Avenue bridge is marked with numerous barricades, including orange barrels, large wooden signs saying road closed with orange striped markings.
[00:55:39.332 --> 00:55:39.672]  Okay?
[00:55:40.332 --> 00:55:46.216]  The barricades include orange barrels, concrete barricades, large wooden signs saying road closed.
[00:55:46.996 --> 00:55:48.317]  Still, they go around all that.
[00:55:48.337 --> 00:55:48.777]  Why?
[00:55:48.897 --> 00:55:50.218]  Because the computer told them.
[00:55:51.274 --> 00:56:11.525]  How willing we are, and I've seen this many times before, going back to the early days of computers, if you could get a computer readout, no matter how stupid your model was, if you could give somebody a computer readout and the bottom of it, it gave you some prediction or told you what to do, people would follow it, because it came on a computer readout.
[00:56:11.545 --> 00:56:17.569]  You know, the number might have been 42, and they said, oh, that's the meaning of the universe, or whatever.
[00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:20.030]  You know, garbage in, garbage out.
[00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:23.991]  If it's a bogus model and you get a printout, that doesn't validate it.
[00:56:24.471 --> 00:56:31.553]  And when I look at this, I have to question whether or not we're going to turn over the steering wheel and the brakes to the Google car.
[00:56:31.713 --> 00:56:36.034]  Do you really trust Google and Apple to drive the car for you?
[00:56:36.954 --> 00:56:38.454]  I've used their apps extensively.
[00:56:38.494 --> 00:56:40.334]  I find them to be very helpful most of the time.
[00:56:41.115 --> 00:56:45.396]  But I've also found them, on occasion, to be totally clueless.
[00:56:45.756 --> 00:56:47.096]  Dangerously clueless.
[00:56:48.257 --> 00:56:52.643]  And I think that they're not ready for prime time, but this is coming faster than you think.
[00:56:53.464 --> 00:57:00.833]  In just a couple of months, Tesla is going to be putting out their car that is going to drive without assistance between cities.
[00:57:02.168 --> 00:57:10.475]  All they have to do, they think, is to connect the GPS navigation with all of these subsystems that are on the control.
[00:57:10.515 --> 00:57:21.185]  The braking, the steering, the acceleration, the cruise control, as well as some radar detectors that are going to determine where the cars are in front and behind you, cameras to see where the lanes are, and they think they're done.
[00:57:22.046 --> 00:57:23.147]  It's not going to be that simple.
[00:57:24.144 --> 00:57:31.970]  But there's a whole world of tyranny that is coming with that, that goes beyond the level of safety that we should be very concerned about.
[00:57:32.471 --> 00:57:33.952]  Look at this story out of Virginia.
[00:57:34.592 --> 00:57:38.275]  They're using federally funded license plate readers to collect local taxes.
[00:57:38.315 --> 00:57:45.721]  This is Newport News, Virginia, and they say the cameras will be mounted on the backs of six Sheriff's Department's cruisers to automatically read license plate numbers.
[00:57:46.021 --> 00:57:49.404]  Those numbers will be cross-searched with a database, updated daily,
[00:57:49.944 --> 00:57:55.748]  At all the license plates in the city with more than $200 in personal property taxes owed.
[00:57:57.029 --> 00:58:02.253]  See, what they're going to wind up doing, and we've already seen them come back to people that owe student loans.
[00:58:02.293 --> 00:58:07.197]  I was just talking about what a mountain of debt students come out of college with, with student loans.
[00:58:08.057 --> 00:58:13.961]  And they're already in some communities, they're going in and saying, we're going to pull your license for your profession.
[00:58:13.981 --> 00:58:18.465]  If you're a doctor or you're a lawyer, we're going to pull that license unless you pay off the student loan.
[00:58:19.452 --> 00:58:21.473]  They will immobilize you.
[00:58:22.133 --> 00:58:25.374]  They will essentially turn you into a debtor's prison.
[00:58:25.414 --> 00:58:28.315]  That's what we're going to wind up having, a debtor's prison without bars.
[00:58:28.535 --> 00:58:29.795]  You're not going to be able to drive to work.
[00:58:29.835 --> 00:58:31.476]  You're not going to be able to practice.
[00:58:32.056 --> 00:58:36.757]  They will use your automobile to basically put you under house arrest.
[00:58:37.478 --> 00:58:38.538]  That's where this is all headed.
[00:58:38.898 --> 00:58:41.119]  They're even putting speed control cameras in the UK.
[00:58:41.159 --> 00:58:42.919]  They're coming here to the United States as well.
[00:58:42.959 --> 00:58:47.021]  They will automatically govern your car to the speed limit where you are.
[00:58:47.041 --> 00:58:47.561]  Stay with us.
[00:58:47.741 --> 00:58:48.321]  We'll be right back.

[01:00:16.811 --> 01:00:17.832]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:19.694]  Government cover-ups.

[01:00:21.916 --> 01:00:22.797]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.478 --> 01:00:27.102]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.663 --> 01:00:31.728]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.939 --> 01:00:35.219]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:35.279 --> 01:00:36.460]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:39.781]  We're going to be talking to Steve Quayle in the next segment.
[01:00:40.181 --> 01:00:44.402]  We're going to talk to him about his take on Jade Helm, what he's concerned about.
[01:00:44.442 --> 01:00:51.705]  Of course, we played another possibility that's been brought to our attention by some veterans, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:00:52.845 --> 01:00:56.127]  Did a video on it, we played that in the last half hour.
[01:00:56.868 --> 01:01:10.196]  Looking at the map, rotating it a little bit, you get a geographical alignment with Middle Eastern countries and the designation of friendly and hostile kind of roughly corresponds to that as well as the terrain that they would be seeing there.
[01:01:10.236 --> 01:01:19.803]  So there's concern by many that this might be training for a Middle Eastern war that they've been chomping at the bits to get into for many years now as
[01:01:20.923 --> 01:01:25.466]  We have seen they had a agenda of seven countries and five years.
[01:01:25.506 --> 01:01:26.767]  Wesley Clark talked about that.
[01:01:27.727 --> 01:01:31.109]  And so are they going to finally be able to get on with that battle plan?
[01:01:31.129 --> 01:01:33.090]  I don't know what Steve Quayle's take is on this.
[01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:34.531]  I'm anxious to hear what his take is.
[01:01:34.571 --> 01:01:42.316]  We're concerned about the drills that they've been having for the American people going to war with the scenarios of
[01:01:43.036 --> 01:01:44.877]  Internal martial law.
[01:01:44.917 --> 01:01:46.498]  That's what I'm most concerned about.
[01:01:46.518 --> 01:01:50.120]  But I'm concerned about us getting involved in yet another war as well.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.083]  I think we need to step back and say, what is the mission of the military?
[01:01:55.143 --> 01:01:56.784]  What is the valid mission of the military?
[01:01:56.824 --> 01:02:00.766]  Are we going to increase our security by having a war throughout the Middle East?
[01:02:00.826 --> 01:02:04.488]  Are we going to increase our security by having a war with Russia over the Ukraine?
[01:02:04.508 --> 01:02:07.270]  And we're going to talk about that in the third hour.
[01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:08.230]  We're going to go over a
[01:02:10.311 --> 01:02:21.738]  A video that was put out by the Stratfor organization actually was the president speaking at a conference talking about how the existential threat for Russia is the Ukraine.
[01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:28.882]  And how the existential threat for us is to make sure that we keep a corridor between Germany and Russia.
[01:02:29.382 --> 01:02:32.404]  And so we've got conflicting existential threats here, don't we?
[01:02:32.424 --> 01:02:37.467]  So we're going to talk about that as well as some other admissions that he made in that speech that are kind of interesting.
[01:02:38.379 --> 01:02:48.227]  Before we go to the segment with Steve Quayle, I want to go over some of the news that's breaking that I think really illustrates the insanity of the war on drugs.
[01:02:48.547 --> 01:02:54.972]  Here we've got Kim Dotcom, and of course he's being accused, not of dealing with drugs, but of course
[01:02:55.512 --> 01:02:59.453]  They're coming after him with civil asset forfeiture, which they created with the war on drugs.
[01:02:59.473 --> 01:03:01.834]  See how it metastasizes into different areas.
[01:03:01.854 --> 01:03:10.316]  They're saying that he had videos and copyrighted material on his site, and so they shut it down and they're coming after him.
[01:03:10.596 --> 01:03:13.797]  They confiscated 67 million dollars worth of assets.
[01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:16.777]  Things like cash, property, luxury cars, jet skis, art.
[01:03:17.197 --> 01:03:22.939]  The US government, they say, this is an article from Daily Mail, won its civil forfeiture case
[01:03:23.399 --> 01:03:29.746]  We're going to talk about whether they won anything, whether it's a case against Kim Dotcom and the Megalopload founder.
[01:03:30.287 --> 01:03:34.011]  And he's lost $67 million in assets as a result.
[01:03:34.071 --> 01:03:37.334]  He no longer, they say, owns these properties, these luxury cars.
[01:03:37.795 --> 01:03:38.175]  The U.S.
[01:03:38.235 --> 01:03:42.160]  now owns more than a dozen bank accounts that he had in Hong Kong and New Zealand.
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:43.121]  But this is what he said.
[01:03:43.161 --> 01:03:44.402]  This is what Kim Dotcom said.
[01:03:45.123 --> 01:03:51.807]  He said he indicated that his defeat represents the, quote, sad state of the US justice system.
[01:03:52.188 --> 01:03:52.828]  I would agree.
[01:03:53.408 --> 01:03:54.269]  Because this is why.
[01:03:54.309 --> 01:04:06.137]  He said, by labeling me a fugitive, the US court has allowed the US government to legally steal all of my assets without any trial, without any due process, without any of the tests of the merits.
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:09.381]  The asset forfeiture was a default judgment.
[01:04:09.601 --> 01:04:10.521]  They didn't win a case.
[01:04:10.821 --> 01:04:11.742]  They didn't have a case.
[01:04:11.982 --> 01:04:13.162]  They didn't take him to court.
[01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:16.923]  All they said was, we're going to take all of his property.
[01:04:16.943 --> 01:04:19.404]  And again, this goes even further back.
[01:04:19.464 --> 01:04:32.048]  This goes back to the RICO statutes that were enacted during the Nixon administration to go after organized crime, saying that we can't get convictions against these guys unless we steal all their assets, because they'll be able to hire good lawyers.
[01:04:33.155 --> 01:04:43.263]  Once we allow that to happen, once we broke that chain saying you have to find people guilty, the penalty that you hit them with has to be proportional to the crime.
[01:04:43.804 --> 01:04:51.730]  Once we broke that, then what we got from Ronald Reagan was civil asset forfeiture, where they're going after property because they say that it's affiliated with a drug crime.
[01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:54.733]  And now we see this type of thing, where they can go to somebody that's in another country
[01:04:55.293 --> 01:04:58.558]  Take all of his assets without finding him guilty.
[01:04:58.598 --> 01:05:00.781]  They haven't even put him on trial.
[01:05:00.841 --> 01:05:03.265]  That's the sad state of the justice system.
[01:05:03.585 --> 01:05:04.747]  I absolutely agree with him.
[01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:05.408]  Stay with us.
[01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:08.412]  We'll be right back with Steve Quayle talking about Jade Helm.
[01:05:09.515 --> 01:05:13.718]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[01:05:13.878 --> 01:05:17.841]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[01:05:18.041 --> 01:05:22.825]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:27.508]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[01:05:27.628 --> 01:05:30.950]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.

[01:06:09.125 --> 01:06:10.786]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:06:11.087 --> 01:06:14.870]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:19.693]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:06:19.794 --> 01:06:26.539]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:06:27.079 --> 01:06:34.545]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular
[01:06:34.565 --> 01:06:34.825]  We're good.

[01:07:09.062 --> 01:07:18.588]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:07:18.728 --> 01:07:28.473]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:07:28.653 --> 01:07:31.575]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:07:31.775 --> 01:07:32.396]  I think so.
[01:07:46.732 --> 01:07:46.992]  We're good.
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.061]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:14.081 --> 01:08:17.483]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.044 --> 01:08:24.868]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:24.948 --> 01:08:25.428]  I'm David Knight.
[01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:28.490]  Your host today, we're going to go to Steve Quayle in just a moment.
[01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:32.372]  We're going to talk to him about the Jade Helm exercise.
[01:08:32.432 --> 01:08:34.093]  What he believes is behind this.
[01:08:34.153 --> 01:08:35.054]  What's the purpose of it?
[01:08:35.094 --> 01:08:38.096]  I'm very troubled just by the scale and scope of it.
[01:08:38.576 --> 01:08:48.681]  By the actions that we've seen from our military, one of the things I think got a lot of people scared was this nationwide emergency alert test that happened yesterday, mainly on the East Coast.
[01:08:48.701 --> 01:08:51.102]  This is an article that Paul Joseph Watson had up yesterday.
[01:08:51.482 --> 01:08:53.343]  He said it began around 11 a.m.
[01:08:53.443 --> 01:09:02.508]  Eastern Standard Time, was broadcast in Washington, D.C., Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.
[01:09:03.388 --> 01:09:07.609]  It said that there was going to be an alert that would run from 11 a.m.
[01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:11.150]  until 12 midnight, and the message was up for about 10 minutes.
[01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:16.531]  At no point were the viewers advised that the alert was only a test.
[01:09:16.571 --> 01:09:20.231]  The question is, were they a day early on April Fools or what?
[01:09:20.371 --> 01:09:26.413]  I mean, what do we do with this government that is constantly doing these types of things?
[01:09:26.473 --> 01:09:28.653]  Are they trying to test our reaction to them?
[01:09:29.753 --> 01:09:31.274]  Is this a mistake?
[01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:33.295]  Are they just totally incompetent?
[01:09:33.375 --> 01:09:34.375]  Is it all of the above?
[01:09:34.415 --> 01:09:34.855]  I don't know.
[01:09:34.875 --> 01:09:40.778]  And he points out that, of course, last October we had another very suspicious emergency alert from the White House.
[01:09:41.238 --> 01:09:45.259]  Interrupted TV viewers across America and told them to stand by, tune into their phone.
[01:09:45.299 --> 01:09:46.340]  Now they blame that one.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:47.120]  That was AT&T.
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:52.322]  They said that was some nationally syndicated radio station that sent out the alert message by mistake.
[01:09:53.211 --> 01:09:54.151]  Maybe that was.
[01:09:54.271 --> 01:10:05.134]  He says, despite the fact that only the federal government can send out EAS alerts, the alert system can only be activated by the president in times of an emergency, reported Fox 5.
[01:10:05.754 --> 01:10:08.554]  So, this is the second time we've seen this.
[01:10:08.574 --> 01:10:11.855]  The last time was October, so that's, what, about six months?
[01:10:12.235 --> 01:10:19.457]  They're putting out these nationwide alerts that there's an emergency coming up, and nothing that says that it was a test.
[01:10:20.237 --> 01:10:21.178]  We're all familiar with that.
[01:10:21.198 --> 01:10:22.279]  You know, this is just a test.
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:25.323]  If it had been an actual emergency, they don't do that anymore either.
[01:10:25.884 --> 01:10:30.649]  Constantly keeping the American people in a state of questioning what is real and what isn't.
[01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:34.633]  That is part of a massive PSYOP, if nothing else.
[01:10:35.752 --> 01:10:40.558]  Uh, and you know, we've got a special here at InfoWars this week.
[01:10:40.578 --> 01:10:43.322]  We're not fooling you with free shipping.
[01:10:43.382 --> 01:10:45.645]  It's going to start today and go through Friday.
[01:10:46.446 --> 01:10:50.911]  And all the products at the InfoWars store, but especially if you combine that with
[01:10:52.148 --> 01:10:58.211]  The special is just the last day of the free bottle of Ancient Defense with two bottles of X2.
[01:10:58.231 --> 01:10:59.652]  There's only a few hundred bottles left.
[01:11:00.172 --> 01:11:01.253]  It'll sell out today.
[01:11:01.413 --> 01:11:08.517]  Again, that's the special where you get a free bottle of Ancient Defense if you get two bottles of Survival X2.
[01:11:08.677 --> 01:11:10.718]  That's the nascent iodine that we have.
[01:11:10.758 --> 01:11:14.960]  And again, there's free shipping from today until Friday.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.703]  That's our No Fooling Free Shipping Special at the InfoWars store at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:11:20.848 --> 01:11:22.650]  Let's go to Steve Quayle now.
[01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:25.433]  Steve was one of the original founders of the PrEP movement.
[01:11:25.533 --> 01:11:28.356]  He's been a talk radio host for 20 years.
[01:11:28.857 --> 01:11:39.008]  He was a lone voice 20 years ago saying that the Chinese and Russians would ultimately back their currencies with gold, that they would want to cash these in on something besides the petrodollar.
[01:11:39.508 --> 01:11:40.550]  He's the author of 10 books.
[01:11:41.611 --> 01:11:44.954]  His most recent entitled Xenogenesis, Turning Men into Monsters.
[01:11:44.994 --> 01:11:50.378]  He wrote Breathe No Evil 15 years ago on understanding bioweapons before anyone thought it was a problem.
[01:11:50.418 --> 01:11:59.286]  I wonder what he thinks about what's going on in Tulane with this Burkholderia Pseudomallei that got out of the lab and they still don't know how it got out.
[01:12:00.568 --> 01:12:04.471]  Maybe we'll talk to him about that, but primarily I want to talk to him about Jade Helm.
[01:12:04.531 --> 01:12:05.852]  Joining us now is Steve Quell.
[01:12:05.892 --> 01:12:06.353]  Thank you, Steve.
[01:12:07.577 --> 01:12:13.845]  Well, David, it's really nice to be on with you because Jade Helm, I think, needs to be put in the larger context.
[01:12:14.286 --> 01:12:22.076]  This is the first time in history that a two-month long operation is going to be focusing on the American public.
[01:12:22.597 --> 01:12:38.245]  We know that the same tactics that are being proposed for the exercise that take place between the hours of midnight and four or five in the morning is exactly what the special operations troops did prior to the bombing of Iraq and all of our different Middle Eastern ventures, whether it's Afghanistan.
[01:12:38.305 --> 01:12:42.627]  In other words, you move the special operations community in prior to an event.
[01:12:42.667 --> 01:12:48.070]  Now remember, I want to take everybody back to Larry Greatwall in his book, No Place to Hide.
[01:12:49.251 --> 01:13:05.603]  If people remember, he was the one that penetrated the weather underground when Bill Ayers and 24 other elite from Ivy League training schools were talking about the necessity in the early 70s of killing 25 million Americans.
[01:13:05.623 --> 01:13:09.686]  And prior to the killing of them, moving them into detention camps,
[01:13:10.146 --> 01:13:11.788]  For re-education.
[01:13:11.848 --> 01:13:16.892]  Now, I know, David, that you've read his stuff, but here's the larger context.
[01:13:17.012 --> 01:13:25.479]  I think that people are being tied up with the, how do I say, the events or the implementation of how they're going to round up people and kill them.
[01:13:25.499 --> 01:13:31.704]  And they're forgetting the idea that when Bill Ayers was making this comment, he was deadly serious.
[01:13:31.804 --> 01:13:37.789]  Now, I've just taken the population density at that point in history, moved it into our point in history,
[01:13:38.329 --> 01:13:48.780]  And the numbers I've heard from special operations, active duty generals, in the past, contemporary military and intelligence agents, is there up to 80 million to 100 million people.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:52.704]  So I think if people put it in a context, notice the change.
[01:13:53.164 --> 01:13:55.727]  Notice the change when Middle East terrorists
[01:13:56.007 --> 01:13:56.407]  I think?
[01:14:11.198 --> 01:14:17.124]  When the local police are told to stand down and not respond to gunfire, by the way, it's a live fire exercise.
[01:14:17.144 --> 01:14:27.275]  When we've seen massive YouTube videos, you guys at Infowars.com have led the charge in showing all the videos coming into you from all over the country.
[01:14:27.455 --> 01:14:29.257]  People are now starting to get it.
[01:14:29.717 --> 01:14:36.759]  And the point that I want to really get across to everyone today, and thank you for taking this hour out of your time to interview me, is this.
[01:14:36.799 --> 01:14:41.100]  This is the full-scale implementation of the red, the blue, and the green list.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:42.761]  The red list are people.
[01:14:42.821 --> 01:14:51.083]  Now, do you remember, David, and I'll let you obviously respond, because that's just my intro, that days years ago when gun owners' homes were being GPSed,
[01:14:51.929 --> 01:14:53.450]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:58.552]  And we warned about that, and we tried to get people to understand.
[01:14:58.712 --> 01:15:13.620]  I was literally in my front yard, right at a mountain community at the base of the mountains in Bozeman, Montana, when the guy came up with his GPS unit and his bicycle and came literally to my front door, and I watched.
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:22.682]  The reason I didn't challenge him at the time, I wanted to see, to the left of me were leftists, to the right of me were leftists, and I wanted to see if they even got GPS.
[01:15:22.862 --> 01:15:23.963]  Absolutely not, okay?
[01:15:24.263 --> 01:15:28.224]  So I watched, this is not a report, but we heard massive reports of that happening.
[01:15:28.684 --> 01:15:40.167]  And the deal that people have got to understand is this, that with the implementation of the red list, the blue list, and green list, that was given to me almost 20 years ago, actually before that,
[01:15:41.141 --> 01:15:51.632]  About how it would be implemented when they were ready to make their move by the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency who was murdered for the Western United States.
[01:15:52.173 --> 01:15:59.401]  So that wasn't just quote internet talk and obviously at that point the internet was just in its beginnings, but I think it's important
[01:15:59.901 --> 01:16:00.261]  Yeah, it does.
[01:16:21.509 --> 01:16:27.093]  And then the thing that people have got to understand is that this is the plan.
[01:16:27.113 --> 01:16:33.818]  So when I say don't lose track of it in perspective, I want to just make one sentence and I'll give it back to you.
[01:16:33.838 --> 01:16:43.705]  In No Place to Hide, I call him Great Wall, maybe it's Graff Wall, explains that the Weathermen actually believe that they would be successful in overthrowing U.S.
[01:16:43.745 --> 01:16:45.607]  government and that with the help of the Cubans,
[01:16:46.247 --> 01:16:50.249]  Chinese, Russians, and North Vietnamese, they would occupy America.
[01:16:50.409 --> 01:16:51.890]  Now remember, this was during the Vietnam War.
[01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:59.194]  Americans would have to be re-educated in camps similar to what communists did in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and other countries that they had taken over.
[01:16:59.614 --> 01:17:01.795]  And then here's one of the most chilling revelations.
[01:17:01.915 --> 01:17:03.716]  I asked, well, what, Great Wall speaking,
[01:17:04.116 --> 01:17:08.157]  Well, what is going to happen to those people we can't re-educate that are die-hard capitalists?
[01:17:08.437 --> 01:17:10.598]  And the reply is, they'd have to be eliminated.
[01:17:11.018 --> 01:17:13.859]  So, David, that's the context of what we see.
[01:17:14.199 --> 01:17:23.942]  The American people, as Alex has pointed out, as you've pointed out, as the, you know, going on day after day, hours after hours, have become the enemy.
[01:17:24.382 --> 01:17:27.183]  And now, in the face of basically nuclear
[01:17:27.923 --> 01:17:29.064]  We're good to go.
[01:17:44.130 --> 01:18:01.670]  Our top flag officers and generals fired any battlefield experience and we've seen complete redirection of funds from foreign enemies to the internal enemies and I've read on the air the letter that was sent in those days by I believe it was
[01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:07.754]  It was either Janet Reno or Napolitano to the Russians requesting their help and the foreign troops.
[01:18:07.795 --> 01:18:09.696]  So you can't deny it any longer.
[01:18:09.716 --> 01:18:11.618]  People used to poo-poo black helicopters.
[01:18:11.638 --> 01:18:13.719]  They used to poo-poo Russian troops, Chinese troops.
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:15.661]  Exactly.
[01:18:15.701 --> 01:18:27.870]  We've had the article we put up over the weekend that Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones put together listing all the many times that they have defined who their domestic enemies are.
[01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:29.692]  It's not just what Larry Graffle is saying.
[01:18:30.072 --> 01:18:31.954]  We've been seeing this coming from the administration.
[01:18:31.975 --> 01:18:36.981]  We've been seeing it coming out of the military academies and other think tanks that are associated with the military.
[01:18:37.021 --> 01:18:38.442]  We saw it coming out of the MIAC report.
[01:18:38.462 --> 01:18:47.633]  When they define what their enemy is, when they come in and do things like the NDAA, and then they start having these training exercises like we saw in Fort Lauderdale, where it looks like they're actually
[01:18:48.334 --> 01:18:58.366]  Implementing the NDAA, dragging people who are civilians down the street, taking them off in helicopters, marching them in single file with military guards on either side, putting them into white vans and driving them off.
[01:18:58.386 --> 01:19:04.193]  I mean, that's exactly what we would expect to see if they implement the NDAA.
[01:19:04.233 --> 01:19:07.157]  But of course, they told us, don't worry, we're not actually going to do that.
[01:19:07.839 --> 01:19:09.460]  I don't believe that they're not actually going to do it.
[01:19:09.781 --> 01:19:22.751]  I don't know when they're going to do it, but of course, as many people have pointed out, whenever there's been a massive false flag attack or whatever, they've had a drill that's going on exactly at the same time, in the same way.
[01:19:23.171 --> 01:19:27.554]  We saw this with the 7-7 bombings in London, the subway bombings.
[01:19:27.834 --> 01:19:30.937]  These people came back the day or so after and said, well, isn't this amazing?
[01:19:30.957 --> 01:19:36.401]  You know, we were running a drill in exactly the same place with exactly the same scenario at the same time this was happening.
[01:19:36.441 --> 01:19:36.961]  It happened with 9-11.
[01:19:37.902 --> 01:19:42.806]  They can always use that to keep the people who are compartmentalized to not understand what's going on.
[01:19:42.826 --> 01:19:46.769]  And then the mass public looks at this and says, well, yeah, this came out after the fact.
[01:19:47.389 --> 01:19:51.232]  But when we expose it before the fact, maybe this particular time this won't happen.
[01:19:51.272 --> 01:19:54.114]  Maybe they will just do some kind of a training exercise.
[01:19:54.134 --> 01:19:56.216]  But we always need to be on the alert.
[01:19:56.716 --> 01:20:00.738]  Stay with us, we're going to take a quick break and we'll come right back to you, Steve Quayle.
[01:20:01.098 --> 01:20:08.262]  We're talking about Operation Jade Helm and Steve is going to tie this together for us on what he thinks is the broader picture.
[01:20:08.282 --> 01:20:08.943]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:10.783 --> 01:20:12.844]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[01:20:13.044 --> 01:20:16.206]  In no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[01:20:16.386 --> 01:20:18.867]  Certainly not in my 22 years in the industry.
[01:20:19.127 --> 01:20:22.788]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[01:20:23.069 --> 01:20:26.550]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:27.911]  Ours is not immune.
[01:20:28.251 --> 01:20:29.872]  The time is now to be proactive.
[01:20:29.892 --> 01:20:30.452]  1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[01:20:35.214 --> 01:20:37.556]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[01:20:37.936 --> 01:20:43.279]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it, so decide.
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:46.642]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[01:20:46.862 --> 01:20:47.822]  The choice is yours.
[01:20:48.163 --> 01:20:49.263]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[01:20:49.303 --> 01:20:50.284]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[01:20:50.404 --> 01:20:51.385]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[01:20:51.405 --> 01:20:51.565]  Call 1-800-686-2237
[01:21:05.457 --> 01:21:05.982]  Extension 116.
[01:21:09.207 --> 01:21:11.768]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:21:12.028 --> 01:21:16.909]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:25.030]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:29.591]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:33.612]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:21:33.772 --> 01:21:39.053]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men
[01:21:39.713 --> 01:21:42.495]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:21:42.875 --> 01:21:48.078]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:21:48.238 --> 01:21:56.363]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:21:56.423 --> 01:21:56.703]  That's 866-229-0927.

[01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:11.806]  Don't complain about your cable bill going up and up and up.
[01:22:11.926 --> 01:22:12.967]  Do something about it.
[01:22:13.127 --> 01:22:15.189]  Grab a pencil and jot down this special number.
[01:22:15.209 --> 01:22:17.731]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[01:22:17.991 --> 01:22:21.535]  The more cable TV rates go up, the better digital satellite TV looks.
[01:22:21.955 --> 01:22:27.540]  Say goodbye to the cable guy and get more of your favorite channels in 100% digital quality for less money.
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:28.141]  Call 1-855-905-MY-TV.
[01:22:30.623 --> 01:22:34.346]  Sign up for packages starting as low as $19.99, and there's no equipment to buy.
[01:22:34.426 --> 01:22:39.289]  You get free HDTV upgrade, a free DVR upgrade, and free professional installation.
[01:22:39.469 --> 01:22:41.831]  You control what you watch, when you watch it.
[01:22:42.111 --> 01:22:46.734]  Record your favorite shows, pause and rewind live TV, even skip the commercials.
[01:22:47.074 --> 01:22:48.375]  Watch local channels, too.
[01:22:48.595 --> 01:22:51.057]  At just $19.99, what are you waiting for?
[01:22:51.238 --> 01:22:53.079]  Pull out your major credit or debit card.
[01:22:53.159 --> 01:22:57.182]  Call 1-855-905-MY-TV.
[01:22:57.202 --> 01:22:57.983]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[01:22:58.504 --> 01:23:00.165]  Say goodbye to the cable guy.
[01:23:00.345 --> 01:23:01.906]  Cut costs and get more.
[01:23:01.926 --> 01:23:02.307]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[01:23:02.327 --> 01:23:02.547]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[01:23:09.758 --> 01:23:10.978]  This alert just came in.
[01:23:11.158 --> 01:23:18.161]  This special announcement is for business owners and leaders of organizations who've been waiting for the right time to build.
[01:23:18.741 --> 01:23:24.322]  General Steel has made it impossible to wait any longer with rock-bottom prices that could save you thousands.
[01:23:24.663 --> 01:23:25.143]  That's right.
[01:23:25.203 --> 01:23:31.565]  General Steel, America's leader in pre-engineered structures, is offering buildings at prices you will never see again.
[01:23:31.785 --> 01:23:32.705]  Don't miss these prices.
[01:23:33.045 --> 01:23:35.327]  A 50 by 100 for $35,000.
[01:23:35.808 --> 01:23:36.468]  You heard right.
[01:23:36.508 --> 01:23:39.151]  That's 5,000 square feet for $35,000.
[01:23:39.251 --> 01:23:43.634]  Manufacturers, if you need a larger building, try a 100 by 100 commercial building for $129,000.
[01:23:44.275 --> 01:23:47.057]  You can't afford to rent with these prices.
[01:23:47.238 --> 01:23:51.161]  Imagine a 70 by 100 foot church building for under $69,000.
[01:23:51.381 --> 01:23:56.365]  With the economy improving and interest rates still at historic lows, you can't afford to wait.
[01:23:56.546 --> 01:23:57.466]  So call 866-91-STEEL.
[01:23:59.528 --> 01:24:00.990]  Lock in your price now.
[01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.691]  Call 866-91-STEEL.
[01:24:01.711 --> 01:24:02.091]  That's 866-917-8335.
[01:24:02.111 --> 01:24:04.394]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:24:04.534 --> 01:24:06.857]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:23.916 --> 01:24:32.181]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this April Fool's Day, this April 1st, 2015, and we have a special at the InfoWars store, our No Fooling special.
[01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:37.084]  Actually, for real, you get free shipping all the way through this Friday.
[01:24:37.644 --> 01:24:40.566]  Everything at the store, and I'll remind you that as we're looking at this...
[01:24:41.426 --> 01:24:47.091]  Article here, human birth control chemical BPA is causing lower fertility in fish, say government scientists.
[01:24:47.111 --> 01:24:48.612]  This is a report by the Washington Post.
[01:24:49.272 --> 01:24:55.177]  It's producing offspring that struggle to fertilize eggs because of the plastics that they're finding in the water.
[01:24:55.217 --> 01:24:57.679]  But of course, you're also going to find SSRIs.
[01:24:57.959 --> 01:25:08.288]  Even if you're not on a municipal water supply, you're going to, especially out in the country, a lot of people are using, farms are using glyphosate very heavily, Roundup.
[01:25:09.188 --> 01:25:11.769]  Uh, you can filter that out with a ProPure filter.
[01:25:11.789 --> 01:25:14.350]  You can find that at the InfoWars store, 10% off.
[01:25:14.991 --> 01:25:20.793]  And again, it's free shipping between now and Friday at the InfoWars stores.
[01:25:21.073 --> 01:25:23.434]  InfoWars store and InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:25:23.454 --> 01:25:25.455]  I want to go back to Steve Quayle.
[01:25:25.615 --> 01:25:29.557]  Steve, you were talking about the fact that you're concerned that this is
[01:25:30.857 --> 01:25:35.961]  Coming to the next step, coming to fruition in terms of a war against the American people, talking about Larry Grathwald.
[01:25:36.201 --> 01:25:38.943]  You're talking about the red list, the blue list, and the green list.
[01:25:39.043 --> 01:25:40.664]  Break that down for the audience.
[01:25:41.582 --> 01:25:49.870]  The Red Lists are the primary target for the New World Order in the United States of America when the order is given.
[01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:55.074]  The list already exists, and again, according to... I want to make this clear.
[01:25:55.174 --> 01:25:57.777]  I cannot know this stuff unless people tell me.
[01:25:57.837 --> 01:26:00.139]  Just like Alex gets tips, you get tips, David.
[01:26:00.559 --> 01:26:03.162]  There are people out there that genuinely love their country.
[01:26:03.222 --> 01:26:05.063]  So that's how I got this.
[01:26:05.083 --> 01:26:07.766]  The Red Lists are primarily firearms owners.
[01:26:08.406 --> 01:26:09.788]  They are constitutionalists.
[01:26:10.068 --> 01:26:14.153]  They are people who have been politically active in resisting the New World Order.
[01:26:14.553 --> 01:26:16.676]  And those are the people that are their targets.
[01:26:16.776 --> 01:26:18.058]  And let me make this clear.
[01:26:18.418 --> 01:26:20.601]  They're not coming to take the guns away.
[01:26:20.661 --> 01:26:25.807]  They're coming to terminate, exterminate, blow away the gun owners.
[01:26:26.407 --> 01:26:33.311]  Again, special operations teams are not sent in to take prisoners unless it's a high-value target for a later date.
[01:26:33.431 --> 01:26:37.913]  They basically are trained to go in and just obliterate, okay?
[01:26:38.374 --> 01:26:49.800]  Now again, when I get told this by a four-star general, active duty, and by the way, you guys have more probably active duty spec ops and spooks in Austin than any other
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:53.041]  Uh, city in the United States of America.
[01:26:53.101 --> 01:26:54.001]  You probably know that.
[01:26:54.061 --> 01:26:55.842]  If you don't, I will tell you that.
[01:26:56.282 --> 01:27:02.144]  And the thing that's fascinating to me, David, is the red list basically goes down the first 30 days.
[01:27:02.324 --> 01:27:02.724]  Okay?
[01:27:03.164 --> 01:27:05.105]  So, let's say they've increased it to 60 days.
[01:27:05.125 --> 01:27:08.166]  Well, things, they're combining now two different events.
[01:27:08.606 --> 01:27:16.569]  Now, the system that's been set to communicate with law enforcement from the Department of Homeland Security is a pretty secure system now.
[01:27:17.049 --> 01:27:24.318]  They can lock out individual officers from being able to hear the general alerts, they can punish, or they can terminate.
[01:27:24.438 --> 01:27:28.323]  Now, these are really hard statements for people to understand.
[01:27:28.904 --> 01:27:30.045]  Quick anecdote, 32nd version.
[01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:39.503]  Detectives in a major metropolitan city heard me on, I think it was one of the interviews Alex and I were doing a couple years ago.
[01:27:39.744 --> 01:27:47.467]  He didn't think I was basically up front with the information until a foreign observer was assigned.
[01:27:47.507 --> 01:27:48.628]  I told him what to look for.
[01:27:49.228 --> 01:27:55.934]  The Foreign Observer knew everything about he, his family, his children, when they went to school, how much money he made.
[01:27:56.394 --> 01:27:57.655]  He knew everything.
[01:27:57.795 --> 01:28:01.018]  And he rode along in the back of two detective's cars.
[01:28:01.598 --> 01:28:10.506]  And the interesting thing was, is I got a call from the individual, probably a week later, and he said, you're right, this is going down just exactly as you said.
[01:28:10.526 --> 01:28:12.988]  Well, I wasn't the originator of that, the blue list.
[01:28:13.468 --> 01:28:20.835]  Our law enforcement, National Guard, and anybody who's contributing to the execution and the takedown of the Redlers.
[01:28:21.776 --> 01:28:26.020]  30 days to 60 days after that, those guys get wasted.
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:30.644]  Now, again, I don't know what word you would use, David, but they're murdered, they're killed.
[01:28:30.664 --> 01:28:30.864]  Yeah.
[01:28:31.125 --> 01:28:33.267]  And where have we seen that in history before?
[01:28:33.327 --> 01:28:33.807]  Go ahead.
[01:28:34.187 --> 01:28:37.831]  Oh yeah, the Navy SEALs that got Bin Laden, right?
[01:28:38.527 --> 01:28:39.267]  Yep, you got it.
[01:28:39.788 --> 01:28:52.574]  And so, as a matter of fact, before I went on this show, I was contacted by a Navy SEAL overseas, and he said, Steve, I cannot believe what's happening to the country I love and was ready to lay down my life for.
[01:28:53.014 --> 01:28:55.395]  He said, it's like a Paul, if you will.
[01:28:56.304 --> 01:29:00.746]  A blanket of darkness has settled over the country and people can't see.
[01:29:01.187 --> 01:29:16.415]  What's happened, David, is one of the things that I've really tried to do in talk radio and all the stuff I've written and the interviews I've done, 9,000 plus hours, is to get people to understand you've got to understand the root of evil because everything else is an offshoot of evil.
[01:29:16.955 --> 01:29:32.744]  May I give you one more interview that took place recently with a personal friend of mine, known to me, who met with various generals, retired, and what they told him was simply this, is that it is going operational.
[01:29:32.825 --> 01:29:38.588]  Now this is generals, this isn't make-believe, this isn't scuttlebutt, this isn't internet rumor, okay?
[01:29:38.968 --> 01:29:41.790]  And the gentlemen just happen to be at the top of their hit list.
[01:29:42.170 --> 01:29:43.171]  We gotta go to break, Steve.
[01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:44.431]  Hang on, we're gonna come right back.
[01:29:44.491 --> 01:29:50.214]  And, you know, quite frankly, it's kind of like the couple that drove the car off the GPS bridge.
[01:29:50.454 --> 01:29:53.196]  How many signs do we need before we start to pay attention?
[01:29:53.256 --> 01:29:56.277]  If it isn't happening now, it's gonna be happening very soon.
[01:29:56.337 --> 01:29:56.697]  Stay with us.
[01:29:56.717 --> 01:29:58.859]  We'll be right back with Steve Quayle talking about Jade Helm.
[01:29:58.879 --> 01:29:59.719]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.219 --> 01:30:01.820]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:05.422]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.445 --> 01:30:10.385]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:10.825]  Good, brother.
[01:30:10.965 --> 01:30:12.646]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:30:12.926 --> 01:30:14.467]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:30:14.647 --> 01:30:18.648]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:30:18.668 --> 01:30:21.249]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:30:21.289 --> 01:30:23.529]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:30:23.709 --> 01:30:31.692]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:30:31.892 --> 01:30:34.996]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:30:35.136 --> 01:30:36.638]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:30:36.678 --> 01:30:39.581]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:30:39.721 --> 01:30:41.083]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:30:41.363 --> 01:30:46.729]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[01:30:46.829 --> 01:30:47.510]  We're good to go.
[01:31:09.545 --> 01:31:18.789]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:31:19.029 --> 01:31:23.651]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.

[01:32:16.157 --> 01:32:17.157]  Security alert.
[01:32:17.377 --> 01:32:19.118]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:32:19.378 --> 01:32:19.998]  Analysis.

[01:32:28.999 --> 01:32:30.439]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:33.320]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:36.481]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:36.641 --> 01:32:38.821]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:39.141 --> 01:32:40.441]  People are assaulting us.
[01:32:40.461 --> 01:32:42.682]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:43.282 --> 01:32:44.962]  They are never going to stop.
[01:32:45.243 --> 01:32:49.144]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:32:59.246 --> 01:33:03.667]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:33:03.927 --> 01:33:05.288]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:33:05.328 --> 01:33:06.068]  You can feel it.
[01:33:21.426 --> 01:33:23.569]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:24.050 --> 01:33:25.452]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.036 --> 01:33:30.577]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:30.677 --> 01:33:33.318]  I'm David Knight, your host, and we're talking to Steve Quayle.
[01:33:33.418 --> 01:33:34.318]  SteveQuayle.com.
[01:33:34.838 --> 01:33:38.560]  We're breaking down, Steve was breaking down for us the red list, the blue list.
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:47.444]  We haven't gotten to the green list yet, but Steve, just before we had to go to the break, you started talking about a source that you had and who thought this was going to be operational.
[01:33:47.464 --> 01:33:48.524]  Tell us what he said.
[01:33:49.465 --> 01:33:52.046]  Start that over again for people who are just tuning in.
[01:33:53.021 --> 01:34:16.756]  Former Green Beret had a meeting with retired generals and high-ranking enlisted, former enlisted men who were very concerned because the friend of mine that had had the meeting was asking the meeting because supposedly there was a Pentagon memorandum put out about some of the people in this country that they are forbidden to listen to.
[01:34:17.518 --> 01:34:18.618]  He happened to be one of them.
[01:34:19.139 --> 01:34:20.259]  Alex happened to be one of them.
[01:34:20.659 --> 01:34:21.660]  I happened to be one of them.
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:23.320]  Hawk happened to be one of them.
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:24.701]  And Doug Hagman happened to be one.
[01:34:24.721 --> 01:34:27.402]  There were two other guys that he couldn't remember their name.
[01:34:27.742 --> 01:34:29.462]  One on the East Coast and one on the West Coast.
[01:34:29.522 --> 01:34:31.043]  And I don't know it or I'd tell it.
[01:34:31.747 --> 01:34:32.868]  Here's the issue.
[01:34:32.948 --> 01:34:46.276]  The issue is, David, that the American people must understand that the sheer placement of the tanks, the armored personnel carriers, troops on the streets, and everything else is indicative.
[01:34:46.316 --> 01:34:48.238]  Now, let's talk about Jade Helm, the name.
[01:34:48.278 --> 01:34:48.858]  May I do that?
[01:34:49.218 --> 01:34:49.559]  Yes, sir.
[01:34:49.579 --> 01:34:53.521]  These, simply, are the people that they go into re-education and are assimilated.
[01:34:53.581 --> 01:35:00.986]  They get to live, but they get to live as perpetual drones or techno-serfs at the behest of the New World Order.
[01:35:02.018 --> 01:35:11.245]  The thing that is really critical for people to understand is that Jade Helm's name, Jade is always associated with China.
[01:35:11.725 --> 01:35:16.109]  It has nothing to do primarily with the Middle East, it has everything to do with the Far East.
[01:35:16.569 --> 01:35:20.252]  If I tell you the captain's at the helm, that means he's steering the ship.
[01:35:20.832 --> 01:35:24.775]  That means that he is the one who's in charge of the direction.
[01:35:24.895 --> 01:35:32.439]  One of the Chinese demands upon the United States government was the fact that they needed to disarm the American public.
[01:35:32.459 --> 01:35:38.023]  You remember that story when it came out that China absolutely demanded that the American public be disarmed?
[01:35:38.283 --> 01:35:40.004]  Yeah, remember that was kind of strange, wasn't it?
[01:35:40.324 --> 01:35:40.584]  Yeah.
[01:35:40.644 --> 01:35:41.744]  And there's always something behind that.
[01:35:41.784 --> 01:35:47.766]  It's kind of like when the UN came out and said, you need to shut down Colorado and Washington State.
[01:35:47.886 --> 01:35:50.687]  The federal government needs to shut that down because we have a UN drug treaty.
[01:35:50.707 --> 01:35:56.509]  And of course, it was the UN that set up the schedule for the war on drugs 10 years before Nixon declared the war on drugs.
[01:35:56.849 --> 01:35:57.169]  Right.
[01:35:57.650 --> 01:36:00.332]  Well, what's important is everything's in a name.
[01:36:00.412 --> 01:36:11.202]  Now look, it's not lost on the financial markets that China has amassed the world's largest gold hoard, and this has everything to do with the name Jade Helm 15.
[01:36:11.803 --> 01:36:16.407]  Obviously 15 can relate to the year that it's going to be implemented, as in this year.
[01:36:17.245 --> 01:36:26.531]  China is going to make an announcement at some point, and we're seeing it with the AIIB Bank, we're seeing it with the nation's abandoning former allies.
[01:36:26.591 --> 01:36:31.314]  It doesn't matter if it's Australia, it doesn't matter if it's Britain, it doesn't matter who it is.
[01:36:31.554 --> 01:36:38.679]  Everyone's going to China, because basically, it's a truism, a Marxism in the world that he who has the gold makes the rules.
[01:36:38.699 --> 01:36:45.864]  One of the things the bankers have been able to do is to transfer the gold that was in the United States
[01:36:46.974 --> 01:36:48.835]  It's irrelevant if there's anything in Fort Knox.
[01:36:48.875 --> 01:36:51.256]  I'm here to tell you that there's nothing there.
[01:36:51.877 --> 01:37:01.922]  The point being is that China, with its 30,000 plus tons of gold, by the way, the World Gold Council is totally inaccurate in the country's gold holdings.
[01:37:02.062 --> 01:37:03.703]  Just off the... They're wrong.
[01:37:04.323 --> 01:37:09.866]  Russia, for instance, has right now in excess of 10,000 to 15,000 tons of gold.
[01:37:09.966 --> 01:37:13.588]  So, the point is, let me make this clear, Jade Helm
[01:37:14.814 --> 01:37:23.483]  Maybe the orchestration and the introduction of the Chinese Yuan or Renminbi in a gold-backed or commodity-backed form.
[01:37:24.164 --> 01:37:29.409]  At that point, the dollar will lose value almost overnight, if not become worthless.
[01:37:29.449 --> 01:37:34.574]  My guess is, just quick and dirty, it goes down 50% in a matter of days and then another 30%.
[01:37:35.175 --> 01:37:38.298]  Well, that's not going to make anybody happy in the United States.
[01:37:39.499 --> 01:37:42.621]  The point being is that the riots will be generated.
[01:37:42.641 --> 01:37:44.282]  Now here's something people need to do.
[01:37:44.722 --> 01:37:46.123]  Go to the root of the problem.
[01:37:46.143 --> 01:37:48.525]  You'll understand the fruit and how it will be implemented.
[01:37:49.066 --> 01:37:54.970]  In order for the communist revolution to take place, they want to engender civil war.
[01:37:55.830 --> 01:38:16.909]  I've been saying that, Alex has been saying that, and by the way, obviously with the Mayak Report and others, when the veterans were vilified, any man or woman who has served in this country in any official capacity had to note that this man's military, and I've never been in the military, but that's what a lot of them call it, has changed so dramatically, and it's fascinating to me
[01:38:17.709 --> 01:38:27.137]  That even yesterday or the day before, it may be off a day, but the President of the United States has now declared they want to cut back the military pensions.
[01:38:27.257 --> 01:38:36.925]  At the same time, there's unlimited amounts of money to purchase billions of rounds of ammo, MRAPs, the police department who have been militarized.
[01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:47.355]  You know, when you're talking about that, Steve, I think it's very interesting that it was just last summer that the Pentagon announced that they were going to stop giving equipment to fire departments.
[01:38:47.715 --> 01:38:54.683]  This is something that they've been doing since the, right after World War II, giving equipment to small rural fire departments because they can't afford
[01:38:55.003 --> 01:38:55.443]  Very much.
[01:38:55.563 --> 01:38:58.764]  And they're the ones who have to deal with the really large fires.
[01:38:59.064 --> 01:38:59.964]  And so they shut that down.
[01:39:00.004 --> 01:39:01.444]  It stayed shut down for about a month.
[01:39:01.484 --> 01:39:04.505]  But there was a lot of pressure from the firemen, from congressmen and senators.
[01:39:04.525 --> 01:39:05.505]  They got that restarted.
[01:39:05.845 --> 01:39:13.606]  But that was happening at the very same time they couldn't get enough equipment quickly enough into all these small towns for law enforcement.
[01:39:13.626 --> 01:39:18.867]  They only wanted to give equipment to people who had the power and the authority to arrest.
[01:39:19.247 --> 01:39:20.867]  That was going to be what they were going to do it for.
[01:39:20.947 --> 01:39:22.488]  Not to the fire departments.
[01:39:22.508 --> 01:39:24.208]  They wanted to completely shut that down.
[01:39:25.447 --> 01:39:26.629]  Well, and you're correct.
[01:39:26.749 --> 01:39:41.228]  So the point is, is that in essence, all the fire departments, any authority figures that with the power to arrest, and by the way, everybody, as you know, has been given the power to arrest now from IRS agents to...
[01:39:42.049 --> 01:39:45.474]  Remember when the Forest Service Rangers never wore weapons?
[01:39:45.574 --> 01:39:54.605]  I can tell you from watching them, I take a lot of photographs and you know in the national parks and now you would swear that you would declare freely.
[01:39:54.665 --> 01:40:00.312]  You can't believe how weighted down those guys are with weapons in their car, AR-15s and shotguns.
[01:40:00.697 --> 01:40:07.621]  And of course, you shouldn't worry about the fact that they got billions of rounds of hollow point bullets, which the military doesn't even use.
[01:40:07.641 --> 01:40:09.742]  You shouldn't even worry about that, as we got all the pushback.
[01:40:09.782 --> 01:40:14.184]  They would look at the small purchases for some of these organizations and say, well, that's just for target shooting.
[01:40:14.464 --> 01:40:15.705]  But it's three billion.
[01:40:15.725 --> 01:40:18.066]  They would take the very smallest ones and they would push back against that.
[01:40:18.126 --> 01:40:19.487]  But we won that fight.
[01:40:19.947 --> 01:40:32.516]  And I guess, Steve, the question is, we also had this fight about a year ago with them trying to start the war in Syria with a false flag sarin gas attack, trying to blame that on the appropriate parties so they could use that as a pretext for war.
[01:40:33.116 --> 01:40:41.922]  Do you think that because this has been exposed, has gone viral, and there's so much talk about it, do you think that they will just stand this down and it'll just be a training exercise?
[01:40:41.983 --> 01:40:43.884]  Not to say that they won't do this in the future, but
[01:40:44.264 --> 01:40:50.325]  Don't you think that the very publicity that has come there might make them to stand down on this for the time being?
[01:40:51.565 --> 01:40:53.886]  That's what I'm praying for, literally, okay?
[01:40:54.186 --> 01:41:10.849]  And I literally am asking the prayerful, believing Christians around the world to pray against this because, again, it's kind of like when, even in the Old Testament times, David, when, you know, the idea or the plan to murder all of God's people
[01:41:11.409 --> 01:41:12.991]  That, you know, was taking place.
[01:41:13.111 --> 01:41:19.317]  God raised up somebody, whether it was the Prophet Elijah, who could read the king's thoughts while he slept on his bed.
[01:41:19.757 --> 01:41:26.343]  I think that when at least a covert operation gets exposed, that they have to rethink.
[01:41:26.423 --> 01:41:27.364]  And let me share this.
[01:41:27.745 --> 01:41:34.231]  These guys have supercomputers calculating every single step and every single response.
[01:41:34.651 --> 01:41:36.293]  They have algorithms.
[01:41:36.653 --> 01:41:52.247]  When I broke the story about algorithms, the mathematical, if you will, structuring of specific, if you will, assassination parameters and rating people on a different scale, they have their targets already gridded out.
[01:41:52.667 --> 01:42:04.237]  It is my prayer, it is my concern that enough people scream about this, that enough people go to the congressman, because I posted a couple weeks ago, remember the old miniseries America?
[01:42:05.675 --> 01:42:05.895]  Oh yeah.
[01:42:05.975 --> 01:42:13.579]  Remember that the scene where the Russians come in under the guise of being quote national terrorists and kill all of Congress?
[01:42:13.859 --> 01:42:14.019]  Yeah.
[01:42:14.239 --> 01:42:15.380]  And the Russian is addressing?
[01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:26.145]  Well, isn't it interesting that, what was it, the Senator from South Carolina made the statement that, you know, Obama should have the right to basically do away with Congress.
[01:42:26.185 --> 01:42:26.685]  You remember that?
[01:42:27.352 --> 01:42:28.133]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:42:28.373 --> 01:42:30.054]  Well, effectively he has, hasn't he?
[01:42:30.395 --> 01:42:32.557]  I mean, he pretty much does whatever he wishes.
[01:42:32.597 --> 01:42:36.900]  He's not constrained by the Constitution, by laws, he's not constrained by Congress or their threats.
[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:44.607]  I mean, they're saying now, you know, he wants to do, he wants to implement the UN's climate change treaty just by executive order.
[01:42:44.687 --> 01:42:49.111]  And the Republicans are saying, well, you know, all these countries need to realize that we just may undo that.
[01:42:49.331 --> 01:42:50.752]  They know they're not going to undo anything.
[01:42:50.973 --> 01:42:52.214]  These guys are not doing anything.
[01:42:52.867 --> 01:42:54.369]  You know, this is something critical.
[01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:58.354]  And please, understand the root is what I'm talking about.
[01:42:58.794 --> 01:43:05.062]  If people will go on my website and go to my alert section, I just posted this as Nico was giving me the countdown for the break.
[01:43:05.763 --> 01:43:09.848]  And I didn't know this, I'm not a video gamer, but are you familiar with Diablo 3?
[01:43:11.556 --> 01:43:18.421]  Diablo 3, the main character, the witch doctor, is Jade Helm, okay?
[01:43:18.501 --> 01:43:32.472]  And I want to read this because, again, this is, this has, even Alex is talking more and more, when I say even Alex, as Alex is talking more and more about the demonic manifestation, the supernatural element, people have got to read this.
[01:43:32.532 --> 01:43:34.453]  It's on my website, stevequayle.com.
[01:43:34.473 --> 01:43:38.256]  Go over on the right, it's the Q Alert, big Q, and it says Alerts.
[01:43:38.736 --> 01:43:39.958]  I was blown away by this.
[01:43:39.998 --> 01:43:46.325]  Some lady named Jean sent it to me, and I want to read this to you, because it's just a quick paragraph, you know.
[01:43:46.806 --> 01:43:53.774]  It says, the Witch Doctor, that's who's, the Witch Doctor's a character that uses the Jade Helm, again, from their website.
[01:43:54.134 --> 01:43:59.120]  He weaves the power of the spirits of the unformed lands, summoning creatures from beyond the grave.
[01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:12.505]  He summons frightful undead vermin and other creatures for protection and offense, uses destructive poisons, acids, fire attacks, powers, spells, and summons with mana, a slow accruing but deep well of energy.
[01:44:12.886 --> 01:44:16.007]  The witch doctors make use of a variety of weaponry.
[01:44:16.427 --> 01:44:21.029]  I think that the critical thing that people have to understand, you brought up Syria.
[01:44:21.349 --> 01:44:22.650]  Here it is in context.
[01:44:22.850 --> 01:44:26.011]  If people can understand this simple concept,
[01:44:26.591 --> 01:44:28.714]  Everything, excuse me, makes sense.
[01:44:29.115 --> 01:44:43.553]  Number one, in order for the Mahdi to come on the scene, that is obviously the Islamic savior, that is obviously the reign and rule of Muhammad on earth, there has to be a global nuclear conflagration.
[01:44:43.573 --> 01:44:44.515]  Are you aware of that?
[01:44:45.266 --> 01:44:47.508]  No, no, I wasn't aware of that.
[01:44:47.588 --> 01:44:48.429]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:44:48.449 --> 01:44:54.814]  So, and please, I only ask that basically to allow you to feedback, because I don't want to dominate, but I think we only got an hour.
[01:44:55.195 --> 01:45:01.020]  The thing is that we are now seeing the disruption of all the countries in the Middle East.
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:07.324]  Well, classical Christian dispensationalism always said the Ten Nations were the Holy Roman Empire.
[01:45:07.724 --> 01:45:18.251]  I said, you know, decades ago, this is only to put it into perspective, that I saw a Ten Nation Federation building and coming into being in the Middle East.
[01:45:18.311 --> 01:45:20.632]  Now you've got the whole Middle East on fire.
[01:45:21.052 --> 01:45:26.816]  You've got, basically, the ultimate betrayal of Israel by the United States.
[01:45:27.236 --> 01:45:36.620]  Now, whether people like Israel, don't like them, the point being is in the Old Testament prophecies of Zachariah, it says all the nations of the world will gather against Jerusalem.
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:37.301]  That's happening.
[01:45:37.581 --> 01:45:39.542]  Yeah, I think you're very right.
[01:45:39.622 --> 01:45:43.564]  You know, what we need to hope for is that by exposing this,
[01:45:44.204 --> 01:45:46.467]  We are going to shut it down at least this time.
[01:45:46.507 --> 01:45:51.052]  Perhaps they'll decide that maybe they'll just do this exercise on an annual basis.
[01:45:51.092 --> 01:45:54.155]  And maybe by Jade Helm 17 they'll actually roll it out.
[01:45:54.215 --> 01:45:57.840]  But I think you're right when you said earlier we need to pray about this.
[01:45:57.900 --> 01:46:00.603]  We need to ask that this would not happen.
[01:46:00.623 --> 01:46:02.345]  That we would have peace, not only in our country.
[01:46:02.885 --> 01:46:08.509]  But in these other countries, and you know, I should have mentioned it earlier too, you know, Alex is having a hernia operation today.
[01:46:08.529 --> 01:46:18.476]  I'd ask people to pray for Alex, pray that he would have a successful outcome, there wouldn't be any complications, that he would be at peace with this and have a quick recovery.
[01:46:18.497 --> 01:46:20.058]  So I'd ask for people's prayers about that.
[01:46:20.738 --> 01:46:23.600]  And he gave me this before he left.
[01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:28.023]  He said that he's going to be running a, I just want to mention this quickly, a free shipping special.
[01:46:28.043 --> 01:46:31.005]  It's their April Fool's special, but there's no fooling.
[01:46:31.025 --> 01:46:36.309]  We do have free shipping through Wednesday and this is the last chance, this is the last day to get DNA
[01:46:36.889 --> 01:46:37.289]  I think so.
[01:47:06.619 --> 01:47:07.759]  At the store, no fooling.
[01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:25.165]  Now, Steve, as you were pointing out, I think it's very interesting to look at this enemies list that they have and the fact that, you know, the connection that the Chinese government is starting this Asian investment bank, and that is really taking off.
[01:47:25.185 --> 01:47:28.506]  I mean, that's turning into an avalanche of people who are signing up for that.
[01:47:28.786 --> 01:47:32.129]  And of course, the Chinese are flush with cash.
[01:47:33.209 --> 01:47:37.433]  They're using this in a very different way than we have used the IMF fund.
[01:47:37.493 --> 01:47:40.936]  But even the United States is trying to get on this just so that they won't be left off.
[01:47:40.976 --> 01:47:44.718]  We see a massive shift from the United States, of course, to China.
[01:47:44.759 --> 01:47:46.860]  But that's been going on for quite some time.
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:47.861]  Everybody can see that.
[01:47:48.341 --> 01:47:50.323]  But it's really accelerating at this point, isn't it?
[01:47:51.477 --> 01:47:54.919]  Well, it's not only accelerating, but you know, somebody said, what's in a name?
[01:47:55.319 --> 01:47:57.000]  My answer to that is everything.
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:04.184]  When any operation is chosen, there is usually a reason for the name being chosen.
[01:48:04.264 --> 01:48:07.365]  And that's why I believe that Jade Helm is so critical.
[01:48:07.425 --> 01:48:10.087]  Let me make this clear, and this is something
[01:48:10.547 --> 01:48:13.650]  That I stand on after 10 or 12 books.
[01:48:13.690 --> 01:48:14.891]  I think I'm up to 12 now.
[01:48:15.331 --> 01:48:16.272]  Thanks for announcing that.
[01:48:16.312 --> 01:48:22.257]  But the point that I'm trying to provide for people is a perspective, how to embrace this.
[01:48:22.617 --> 01:48:28.582]  Because if you try, and David you'll find this out, if you try and look at this purely in the natural,
[01:48:29.082 --> 01:48:42.397]  There is a, you cannot look at it purely in the natural because it's like a, and I'm going to use the word, supernatural evil force, that's seeking to subject and subjugate the people of the world, not only kill them.
[01:48:42.417 --> 01:48:44.038]  Look, the Illuminati, Alex Jones...
[01:48:45.339 --> 01:48:49.101]  I mean, that's something that we see, this relentless progression towards this.
[01:48:49.461 --> 01:48:56.105]  And it's like, why would the people care so much to pass on an agenda from one generation to the other?
[01:48:56.125 --> 01:48:58.206]  You would think each generation would have its own agenda.
[01:48:58.486 --> 01:49:01.928]  But as you point out, this is a supernatural backing behind this.
[01:49:02.008 --> 01:49:07.931]  That's, I think, why this continues along this same path of progression from generation to generation.
[01:49:08.965 --> 01:49:14.729]  Well, and again, that's why I'm accelerating my efforts.
[01:49:14.809 --> 01:49:16.670]  Look, I don't know how long I have.
[01:49:16.710 --> 01:49:20.273]  By the grace of God, I thank everyone for their prayers, and I do pray for Alex.
[01:49:20.993 --> 01:49:28.098]  Thank God I had an operation years ago, a hernia operation, and when they do them right, you're on your feet pretty quick.
[01:49:28.138 --> 01:49:29.119]  You know, you hurt a little bit.
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:37.068]  May my prayers go with him, and I thank God for everyone who prays for Alex's safety and the protection around his family.
[01:49:37.469 --> 01:49:38.770]  But I want to share something, David.
[01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:46.921]  This is important because unless, and I want to say this, if this were my last time on talk radio, I would say what I'm going to say right now.
[01:49:47.561 --> 01:50:05.193]  Unless people understand the supernatural root of evil, they will not understand that when the Illuminati talks in the Georgia Guidestones about 500 million people being left, Alex and I did a show where we quoted every, you know, person of power and how they hate humanity.
[01:50:05.633 --> 01:50:12.857]  The vaccines, it was on Infowars.com when we were going to have this level 5 biological shutdown of the country.
[01:50:13.298 --> 01:50:15.059]  Alex let me pray at that point.
[01:50:15.499 --> 01:50:19.263]  And I said, the only thing I got from the Lord was, watch what I will do.
[01:50:19.543 --> 01:50:26.309]  Within 24 hours, we are going from a global pandemic, shutdown and martial law, to the thing fading out and fizzling out.
[01:50:26.569 --> 01:50:30.333]  When we start exposing Ebola, the thing faded out and fizzled out.
[01:50:30.393 --> 01:50:31.634]  Not to say it won't come back.
[01:50:32.474 --> 01:50:52.200]  You know, the point being, when you hear of almost ridiculous releases of some of the most deadly pathogens in the world, and I wrote Breathe No Evil 15 years ago, the point is that I know, I know, I know how these people think, because again, there is a God in heaven who reveals the secrets to his servants, the prophets.
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:53.161]  I'm not a prophet.
[01:50:53.281 --> 01:50:54.501]  All I am is a watchman.
[01:50:54.901 --> 01:50:55.542]  Absolutely.
[01:50:55.582 --> 01:50:56.102]  Hang on, Steve.
[01:50:56.122 --> 01:50:57.283]  We've got to go to a commercial break.
[01:50:57.303 --> 01:51:03.769]  When we come back, I do want to talk to you about that book, Breathe No Evil, in light of what just happened in Tulane University.
[01:51:03.789 --> 01:51:04.189]  Stay with us.
[01:51:04.209 --> 01:51:04.810]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:10.296 --> 01:51:17.581]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:51:17.821 --> 01:51:22.105]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:51:22.325 --> 01:51:27.168]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[01:51:27.468 --> 01:51:34.654]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:51:34.954 --> 01:51:39.317]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[01:51:39.617 --> 01:51:45.199]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:51:45.619 --> 01:51:52.161]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.

[01:52:14.929 --> 01:52:18.550]  We're all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?
[01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:20.450]  The answer is clear.
[01:52:20.930 --> 01:52:22.931]  Get prepared and you get prepared now.
[01:52:23.511 --> 01:52:26.132]  Now the only question left is where do we begin?

[01:53:30.837 --> 01:53:32.937]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.

[01:53:49.761 --> 01:53:51.702]  Read the facts at InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:53:54.765 --> 01:54:00.391]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[01:54:00.711 --> 01:54:02.493]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[01:54:02.853 --> 01:54:05.476]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[01:54:30.484 --> 01:54:31.845]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:31.885 --> 01:54:34.526]  I'm David Knight in Austin, and we're talking to Steve Quill.
[01:54:34.546 --> 01:54:39.589]  We've been talking about Jade Helm, and Steve's pulled us back to talk about the broader context.
[01:54:39.689 --> 01:54:45.452]  And Steve, I want to talk about your book here, Xenogenesis, Turning Men into Monsters.
[01:54:45.472 --> 01:54:51.895]  You'd also talked about, you also had a book, Breathe No Evil, where you were talking about bioweapons.
[01:54:51.915 --> 01:54:52.596]  And we've just seen
[01:54:53.536 --> 01:55:05.383]  I've gotten a glimpse into the massive, if you want to call it, incompetence of the CDC and these biotech companies who are bringing foreign pathogens, very deadly pathogens, into this country.
[01:55:05.423 --> 01:55:16.149]  We just saw an example of it in Tulane, to give them a gain of function, that's what they call it, enhancing them to withstand medication, to also spread more easily.
[01:55:16.169 --> 01:55:19.471]  And so we have to look at this and say, what is the madness behind this?
[01:55:19.611 --> 01:55:20.472]  Why would they even
[01:55:21.452 --> 01:55:45.777]  Well, xenogenesis is important for people to understand because behind the intentional release of bioweapons, remember this, that when people are being exposed to headlines that there's been a strange release or that the CDC, the Center for Disease Control, thought that the
[01:55:46.937 --> 01:55:51.100]  Last remaining supplies of smallpox always mysteriously turn up.
[01:55:51.740 --> 01:56:01.527]  Every pathogen worldwide that has been located, isolated, or reanimated is designed for bioweapons.
[01:56:01.547 --> 01:56:07.230]  The basis of all bioweapons is ultimately first to kill the enemy, but ultimately to end all life.
[01:56:07.791 --> 01:56:12.854]  When I broke the story, David, 32nd important story on race-specific bioweapons in South Africa,
[01:56:13.354 --> 01:56:13.474]  Yes.
[01:56:13.494 --> 01:56:13.594]  Yes.
[01:56:35.095 --> 01:56:38.939]  Super Soldiers, this is stuff that I wrote in my book, Xenogenesis.
[01:56:39.399 --> 01:56:55.775]  What they're doing is taking third party DNA sequences, and Xenogenesis just means the addition of additional helix to the double helix, creating a triple helix, in other words a stand, and creating literally new life forms.
[01:56:56.315 --> 01:57:02.780]  Now, when I first wrote that in Genetic Armageddon 15 years ago, people just couldn't handle it.
[01:57:03.181 --> 01:57:05.583]  But now we're right there where, guess what?
[01:57:05.603 --> 01:57:20.775]  The lie that people are being told is biological enhancements are one thing, but when you combine them with robotics, you're going to get basically an Uberman, which Nietzsche talked about, and which the Nazis were absolutely looking for.
[01:57:20.795 --> 01:57:22.917]  The word Uberman literally means superman.
[01:57:23.477 --> 01:57:32.127]  So when DARPA went forward with its Super Soldier program and basically started integrating specific gene traits from animals, i.e.
[01:57:32.247 --> 01:57:33.488]  eagle vision, i.e.
[01:57:33.548 --> 01:57:36.612]  regenerative processes of a salamander, i.e.
[01:57:36.932 --> 01:57:42.018]  all of the different things, you know, it was just like, it's just like this was a comic book series
[01:57:42.518 --> 01:57:43.399]  We're good to go.
[01:58:03.491 --> 01:58:04.411]  Absolutely.
[01:58:04.431 --> 01:58:04.531]  What?
[01:58:27.671 --> 01:58:36.098]  Actually, Steve, it's kind of like Genesis, where the serpent promised that with this knowledge, you're going to be able to live forever, you know?
[01:58:36.118 --> 01:58:38.080]  You're not going to ever die.
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:41.203]  Thank you so much for joining us at stevequayle.com.
[01:58:41.683 --> 01:58:42.484]  Check out his website.
[01:58:42.504 --> 01:58:43.304]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:43.364 --> 01:58:46.947]  In the next hour, we're going to talk to Joe Biggs in here.
[01:58:46.967 --> 01:58:49.069]  We're going to talk about what's going on in the Ukraine.
[01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.490]  Stay with us.
[01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:50.090]  We'll be right back.

[01:58:59.508 --> 01:59:05.670]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:08.391]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:59:08.431 --> 01:59:15.193]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:59:15.473 --> 01:59:18.314]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:59:18.454 --> 01:59:21.395]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:59:21.415 --> 01:59:23.396]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:59:23.416 --> 01:59:26.277]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:59:26.357 --> 01:59:31.859]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:59:32.079 --> 01:59:35.561]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:59:35.581 --> 01:59:38.562]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:00:20.300 --> 02:00:21.100]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.881 --> 02:00:22.801]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.421 --> 02:00:27.103]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.603 --> 02:00:31.665]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.361 --> 02:00:36.621]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight.
[02:00:37.222 --> 02:00:41.222]  It's a pretty heavy discussion we just had with Steve Quayle talking about Jade Helm.
[02:00:42.043 --> 02:00:53.225]  I hope that the, and he as well, hopes that, and we pray, that this exposure will keep this from actually going into effect, any kind of martial law this particular time.
[02:00:53.285 --> 02:00:56.445]  I think, with the publicity, I don't think that they will do that.
[02:00:56.485 --> 02:00:58.806]  I think that they will wait until we get accustomed to it.
[02:00:59.606 --> 02:01:01.547]  This is a gradual rollout of things.
[02:01:01.567 --> 02:01:23.273]  Think about if you were just to go back five years ago and just make the leap without hearing any of this, without seeing any of the intervening steps, if you were to just to go back to 2010 even and then drop into today and look at the wars that we have going on, look at the training that we have going on, look at the facilities that they have within their bases, the scenarios that they've done.
[02:01:24.293 --> 02:01:25.674]  Would you have believed any of this?
[02:01:26.479 --> 02:01:29.863]  Ten years ago, you wouldn't have believed the NSA, most of the people.
[02:01:30.203 --> 02:01:32.806]  We have been talking about dragnet surveillance.
[02:01:32.826 --> 02:01:35.949]  We've been talking about what the government has been doing for a long time here at InfoWars.
[02:01:36.590 --> 02:01:39.232]  But most people before Snowden would not believe that.
[02:01:39.292 --> 02:01:42.436]  They would just dismiss that as a paranoid conspiracy theory.
[02:01:42.836 --> 02:01:47.942]  No matter that we had NSA whistleblowers going back to right after September 11th.
[02:01:48.002 --> 02:01:48.983]  People like William Binney.
[02:01:49.835 --> 02:01:58.764]  And others who had pointed out that they had basically just slipped the bonds of the Constitution and were going to do whatever they wished.
[02:01:59.485 --> 02:02:10.856]  And of course we had Michael Hayden brag about the fact at a university, brag about the fact that he didn't get his authorization to do this from the section in a new law.
[02:02:11.216 --> 02:02:13.439]  He got his orders straight from the President.
[02:02:14.226 --> 02:02:19.674]  Well, you know you have orders from the Constitution that go even above the President.
[02:02:19.714 --> 02:02:22.058]  The President and all of the rest of them down.
[02:02:22.158 --> 02:02:23.540]  Take an oath to the Constitution.
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:26.605]  That's the legitimate king of this country.
[02:02:27.186 --> 02:02:28.127]  Lex Rex.
[02:02:28.188 --> 02:02:29.069]  The law is king.
[02:02:29.890 --> 02:02:30.950]  They swear allegiance to it.
[02:02:30.990 --> 02:02:33.551]  They are simply temporary stewards.
[02:02:34.352 --> 02:02:37.833]  But they're acting, and they're taking the position that they are now dictators.
[02:02:37.913 --> 02:02:47.096]  And so we continually see, with the arrogance of Obama, talking about the fact that he's going to implement climate change as the next thing he's going to do by executive order, and nobody can stop him.
[02:02:47.116 --> 02:02:47.536]  And you know what?
[02:02:47.556 --> 02:02:49.617]  The Republicans will not stop him.
[02:02:50.317 --> 02:02:51.918]  They could care less about doing that.
[02:02:52.694 --> 02:02:59.300]  Now we also see that, as I said the other day, I think there's a huge fight at the state level to shut this down from the outside.
[02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:13.253]  Just as we have to expose these operations that are going on, and it's great that this has gone viral, I think we need to expose all of these operations and shut them down at the state level, shut them down with jury nullification.
[02:03:13.573 --> 02:03:16.035]  Not just state legislators nullifying the laws.
[02:03:16.595 --> 02:03:21.059]  But we do have some really bad laws being proposed by state legislatures as well.
[02:03:21.279 --> 02:03:22.180]  So it's a fight.
[02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:24.421]  There's good stuff coming out, there's bad stuff coming out.
[02:03:24.962 --> 02:03:26.963]  Out of Washington, it's nothing but bad news.
[02:03:27.043 --> 02:03:30.266]  But in Texas, we've got this Representative Jason Villalba.
[02:03:31.334 --> 02:03:44.726]  He's a Republican from Dallas and of course he's a guy who has proposed mandatory psych evaluations for students in school and he has also proposed shutting down and penalizing filming cops.
[02:03:44.806 --> 02:03:47.808]  But now we have an article that came out just last night.
[02:03:47.888 --> 02:03:53.754]  Largest Texas police union comes out in opposition to the bill that would restrict filming cops.
[02:03:54.454 --> 02:03:55.655]  Now they point out that
[02:03:56.696 --> 02:04:04.439]  The representative has even described it himself as targeting independent bloggers who are focused on keeping law enforcement accountable.
[02:04:05.580 --> 02:04:08.141]  So in other words, that was his quote.
[02:04:09.041 --> 02:04:10.542]  This is not a characterization from the article.
[02:04:10.582 --> 02:04:16.484]  He says, we want to target, quote, independent bloggers who are focused on keeping law enforcement accountable.
[02:04:17.045 --> 02:04:21.406]  Why would you want to target somebody who is focused on keeping law enforcement accountable?
[02:04:21.847 --> 02:04:22.567]  Why would you do that?
[02:04:23.621 --> 02:04:32.506]  Okay, then they go on to say that although this was set for a hearing tomorrow, it's been withdrawn from a committee agenda as Villalba claims that it is being amended.
[02:04:32.546 --> 02:04:43.532]  The claim was called into question by Charlie Wilkerson, Executive Director of the Combined Law Enforcement Associations, who told NBC that he's under the impression that the bill will be pulled permanently.
[02:04:44.472 --> 02:04:45.053]  Let's hope so.
[02:04:45.673 --> 02:04:54.862]  But what he's trying to do as an excuse is he's not saying that he's pulling this from pressure being put on by people who want to hold law enforcement and people like him accountable.
[02:04:54.883 --> 02:04:56.384]  That's who you really need to hold accountable.
[02:04:56.784 --> 02:05:01.289]  The Texas law enforcement doesn't want it, but he says he's pulling it because he can't write a bill.
[02:05:01.529 --> 02:05:02.450]  We'll see what happens.
[02:05:02.730 --> 02:05:03.171]  Stay with us.
[02:05:03.191 --> 02:05:08.236]  We're going to be talking to Joe Biggs about what's going on in Ukraine as well as Jade Helm.
[02:05:09.352 --> 02:05:10.353]  The experts are clear.
[02:05:10.673 --> 02:05:17.637]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:05:17.797 --> 02:05:24.040]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:27.642]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:05:27.782 --> 02:05:31.684]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:05:32.004 --> 02:05:37.046]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:05:37.326 --> 02:05:38.226]  Not our iodine.
[02:05:38.326 --> 02:05:44.469]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:06:20.497 --> 02:06:25.078]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:06:25.278 --> 02:06:28.620]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:06:28.860 --> 02:06:30.440]  No needles, no injections.

[02:06:43.485 --> 02:06:47.446]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[02:06:47.647 --> 02:06:52.408]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[02:06:52.589 --> 02:06:57.130]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[02:06:57.250 --> 02:07:00.572]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:07:00.732 --> 02:07:04.033]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:04.193 --> 02:07:05.994]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:07:08.935 --> 02:07:18.444]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:07:18.584 --> 02:07:28.353]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:07:28.513 --> 02:07:31.436]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[02:07:31.636 --> 02:07:34.480]  And contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients.
[02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:38.746]  Often times full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[02:07:38.886 --> 02:07:43.292]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[02:07:43.552 --> 02:07:45.835]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[02:07:45.996 --> 02:07:48.239]  And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[02:07:48.539 --> 02:07:53.983]  Instead, Oxy-Powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[02:07:54.203 --> 02:07:59.426]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[02:07:59.546 --> 02:08:05.510]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with Oxy-Powder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:08:18.789 --> 02:08:22.391]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:08:22.891 --> 02:08:24.752]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.793 --> 02:08:33.957]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:33.997 --> 02:08:37.459]  I'm David Knight and we're joined in this segment with Joe Biggs.
[02:08:37.479 --> 02:08:44.082]  We're going to talk about what's going on in the Ukraine and essentially the Stratfor President's take on this.
[02:08:44.502 --> 02:08:47.564]  But of course today is April 1st, April Fool's Day.
[02:08:48.525 --> 02:08:57.654]  And as they point out, in California, it's no joke, April 1st is going to bring double-digit sales tax to several towns in California.
[02:08:57.674 --> 02:08:59.656]  Some of them are going to get 10% or more.
[02:08:59.676 --> 02:09:04.601]  And of course, I remember when they would always increase the sales tax, they would always say, well, it's only a penny.
[02:09:05.529 --> 02:09:06.790]  Yeah, it's not a penny.
[02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:12.094]  Let's say if you got a 4% sales tax when they were telling everybody they were going to go to 5%.
[02:09:12.134 --> 02:09:12.955]  That was a long time ago.
[02:09:12.995 --> 02:09:17.939]  But when they would say that, that's a 25% increase if you go from 4% to 5%.
[02:09:18.459 --> 02:09:20.180]  So yeah, it's not a penny increase.
[02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:21.742]  That's the way they always sell this stuff.
[02:09:21.762 --> 02:09:25.825]  But of course, Americans are taxed on so many different levels.
[02:09:25.865 --> 02:09:30.368]  There's another story out from CNS News saying these are both off of Drudge Report.
[02:09:30.388 --> 02:09:33.150]  Americans must work January 1st through April 24th.
[02:09:34.011 --> 02:09:34.171]  Just
[02:09:52.330 --> 02:09:55.593]  Hey, all this talk about getting rid of the IRS ain't gonna happen.
[02:09:55.733 --> 02:09:56.654]  We're still gonna be here.
[02:09:57.235 --> 02:09:57.655]  That's right.
[02:09:57.795 --> 02:10:04.321]  They will be until we stop the spending, until we stop the growth of the government getting out of control.
[02:10:05.162 --> 02:10:06.263]  But they're spoofing us.
[02:10:06.283 --> 02:10:09.706]  They're spoofing us with the sales tax increases.
[02:10:09.726 --> 02:10:12.629]  They're spoofing us even with calls to get rid of the
[02:10:13.309 --> 02:10:15.491]  I mean, that's what Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio are proposing.
[02:10:15.511 --> 02:10:15.771]  Not even any.
[02:10:28.582 --> 02:10:31.925]  Offsetting cuts and yet you can't get rid of the IRS.
[02:10:31.945 --> 02:10:34.468]  You can't get rid of the income tax if you're going to do that.
[02:10:34.488 --> 02:10:37.650]  Of course, the income tax only pays a small percentage.
[02:10:38.331 --> 02:10:39.652]  We continue to go into debt.
[02:10:39.712 --> 02:10:40.333]  We continue.
[02:10:40.393 --> 02:10:42.755]  It's like a reverse mortgage with the Federal Reserve.
[02:10:42.795 --> 02:10:47.880]  We only pay just kind of the carrying charges each time and we just go farther and farther into debt.
[02:10:48.581 --> 02:10:50.482]  But I'll tell you what is not a joke today.
[02:10:50.522 --> 02:10:58.325]  We have a no-fool, no-fooling special free shipping starting today on April 1st through Friday at the InfoWars store.
[02:10:58.825 --> 02:11:03.447]  And of course, one of our new products is still available, Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[02:11:03.467 --> 02:11:05.608]  It's a ultra-nutraceutical quality
[02:11:05.928 --> 02:11:06.408]  I don't know.
[02:11:36.609 --> 02:11:50.301]  Well, Joe, one of the reasons I wanted to have you on was because I saw this clip from the Stratford president, George Friedman, and it's kind of interesting because every once in a while these guys will get on and they will have these conferences that they speak at.
[02:11:50.321 --> 02:11:53.604]  Like I mentioned earlier, you know, when Petraeus says, you know, America's finished.
[02:11:53.944 --> 02:11:55.566]  We now have the North American Union.
[02:11:55.986 --> 02:11:58.509]  And let's talk about what that means and the implications of that.
[02:11:58.729 --> 02:12:02.012]  So a lot of times they'll kind of open up and, you know, they're talking to the choir.
[02:12:02.672 --> 02:12:06.655]  And they figured nobody's going to watch these dry conferences, but every once in a while we get a tip.
[02:12:06.695 --> 02:12:08.897]  And we got a tip someone sent to us.
[02:12:08.917 --> 02:12:23.527]  It's a German posting of a speech that this guy who's the president, the CEO, the founder, the chief intel officer of Stratfor was talking in a kind of candid way about what's behind this buildup in Russia.
[02:12:23.547 --> 02:12:26.088]  And of course, we just had yesterday, we had a Russian analyst saying,
[02:12:27.129 --> 02:12:35.591]  Yeah, you know, we could basically wipe out North America by putting some nukes on the fault lines at Yellowstone, for example.
[02:12:36.111 --> 02:12:38.592]  I mean, that is very, very provocative.
[02:12:38.612 --> 02:12:42.573]  And when we see that kind of provocation publicly, I mean, that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:12:42.613 --> 02:12:44.573]  There's a lot that's really going on.
[02:12:44.633 --> 02:12:47.534]  And as we'll hear from these excerpts we're pointing out from him,
[02:12:47.754 --> 02:12:50.296]  Everybody knows that there's already fighting going on there.
[02:12:50.336 --> 02:12:51.596]  We've already got soldiers there.
[02:12:52.417 --> 02:12:56.459]  We've got paratroopers, they say, are going to begin a Ukraine mission in mid-April.
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:59.481]  This came out on the 30th from the International Business Times.
[02:12:59.822 --> 02:13:00.942]  But we know that they're already there.
[02:13:00.982 --> 02:13:03.284]  They're just now admitting that they're going there.
[02:13:03.664 --> 02:13:09.508]  But what I thought was really interesting was kind of the admission that they
[02:13:10.368 --> 02:13:13.509]  Have they control those troops and that's what I wanted to get you to talk about.
[02:13:13.549 --> 02:13:23.252]  But let's before we get to that clip I want to play a short clip where he's talking about what the real conflicting existential threats are between the US and between Russia.
[02:13:23.272 --> 02:13:25.572]  Let's play that clip, the existential threat clip.
[02:13:26.093 --> 02:13:30.854]  Is Islamic extremism really the major threat to the United States?
[02:13:30.874 --> 02:13:31.874]  Somebody's asking him a question.
[02:13:31.894 --> 02:13:34.555]  Will it die on its own or will it keep growing?
[02:13:36.105 --> 02:13:37.205]  This is George Freeman.
[02:13:37.325 --> 02:13:41.467]  It is a problem to the United States that is not an existential threat.
[02:13:42.727 --> 02:13:45.908]  It has to be dealt with, but it has to be dealt with proportionately.
[02:13:46.888 --> 02:13:48.489]  We have other foreign policy interests.
[02:13:50.149 --> 02:14:03.973]  So, the primordial interest of the United States, over which for a century we have fought wars, the First, Second Cold War, has been the relationship between Germany and Russia, because united they are the only force that could threaten us.
[02:14:05.194 --> 02:14:07.115]  And to make sure that that doesn't happen.
[02:14:07.616 --> 02:14:14.500]  The point is that the United States is prepared to create a cordon sanitaire around Russia.
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:16.041]  Russia knows it.
[02:14:16.801 --> 02:14:20.703]  Russia believes that the United States intends to break the Russian Federation.
[02:14:21.584 --> 02:14:26.347]  I think that, as Peter Lorre put it, we don't want to kill you, we just want to hurt you a little bit.
[02:14:27.768 --> 02:14:32.951]  The question on the table for the Russians is, will they retain a buffer zone that's at least neutral?
[02:14:34.159 --> 02:14:44.383]  Or will the West penetrate so far into Ukraine that they're 70 miles away from Stalingrad and 300 miles away from Moscow?
[02:14:45.423 --> 02:14:49.284]  For Russia, the status of Ukraine is an existential threat.
[02:14:51.165 --> 02:14:53.666]  And the Russians cannot let go.
[02:14:53.686 --> 02:14:55.366]  There you go.
[02:14:55.386 --> 02:14:58.427]  So he says it's an existential threat what happens in the Ukraine.
[02:14:58.447 --> 02:15:02.809]  Of course, the Ukraine and Crimea have been a part of Russia for a very long time.
[02:15:04.082 --> 02:15:14.113]  And what we see here, and he says that for the last hundred years, for World War I, World War II, as well as the Cold War, we tried to keep Germany and Russia apart.
[02:15:14.133 --> 02:15:17.616]  And the interesting thing is, this was something, of course, that is very interesting to the Germans.
[02:15:17.636 --> 02:15:18.918]  They want to know how they're being played.
[02:15:19.378 --> 02:15:22.879]  Okay, and they're looking at this and it is true.
[02:15:22.919 --> 02:15:27.981]  They've tried to keep Germany and Russia apart because they believe that that is an existential threat to us.
[02:15:28.201 --> 02:15:29.682]  So they want to set up this corridor.
[02:15:29.702 --> 02:15:31.982]  We've got conflicting existential threats, Joe.
[02:15:32.022 --> 02:15:34.323]  Looks like they're really pushing for war.
[02:15:34.563 --> 02:15:35.624]  Yeah, it's very interesting.
[02:15:35.644 --> 02:15:38.485]  I mean, it's definitely a volatile situation over there.
[02:15:38.505 --> 02:15:38.905]  Like you said,
[02:15:39.665 --> 02:15:40.405]  Paratroopers.
[02:15:40.425 --> 02:15:42.166]  I mean, there's already been convoys going on.
[02:15:42.466 --> 02:15:45.428]  We're trying to push their buttons and see if they're going to react.
[02:15:45.868 --> 02:15:46.068]  Yeah.
[02:15:46.108 --> 02:15:47.689]  And it's not going to be good if it happens.
[02:15:47.749 --> 02:15:48.889]  And it's absolutely insane.
[02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:59.154]  As one of the articles we have up on Infowars.com says, a Russian analyst says, this is much hotter, much closer to a conflict than we ever had during the Cold War.
[02:15:59.414 --> 02:15:59.574]  Yeah.
[02:15:59.774 --> 02:16:13.692]  There we had kind of a mutually assured destruction, it was kind of a standoff, there were all these proxy wars in small countries, but now we have gone right to their doorstep and he's pointing out the Russians are very concerned that we're going to get into Ukraine where we could be just 70 miles from Stalingrad, 300 miles
[02:16:15.074 --> 02:16:15.975]  From Moscow.
[02:16:16.135 --> 02:16:18.538]  I mean, that is right on their doorstep.
[02:16:18.578 --> 02:16:22.042]  So they consider that to be something that is an existential threat.
[02:16:22.062 --> 02:16:23.823]  In other words, something to die for.
[02:16:24.064 --> 02:16:30.551]  And he says at the beginning of this, I thought it was very interesting, the person in the audience asked him and said, what about Islamic terrorism?
[02:16:30.571 --> 02:16:31.291]  He goes, well, it's a threat.
[02:16:31.311 --> 02:16:31.932]  We need to deal with it.
[02:16:32.112 --> 02:16:33.614]  But it's not an existential threat.
[02:16:33.814 --> 02:16:37.879]  But yet they tell everybody that everything is targeted towards the Middle East, okay?
[02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:39.221]  They're going with this.
[02:16:39.481 --> 02:16:51.376]  Now, this is the next segment that I wanted to get your comments on, because we had an article came out when the general went over there, this is Lieutenant General Hodges, when he went to the Ukraine and he visited with troops.
[02:16:53.098 --> 02:16:54.739]  was giving them medals.
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:17:06.548]  And RT came out and said, a Russian analyst there said, if an American general thanks Ukrainian fighting forces and gives them medals, that means that he is their general.
[02:17:06.849 --> 02:17:08.210]  And I kind of dismissed this at the time.
[02:17:08.250 --> 02:17:09.891]  It's like, OK, that's RT.
[02:17:10.191 --> 02:17:11.712]  This is kind of over-the-top rhetoric.
[02:17:12.233 --> 02:17:14.615]  But then Stratfor said the same thing.
[02:17:14.635 --> 02:17:15.996]  And I want to get your comments out of that.
[02:17:16.036 --> 02:17:21.560]  Let's listen to what George Friedman with Stratfor said to this group of people that he was talking to.
[02:17:22.398 --> 02:17:26.902]  Last week, ten days ago, General Hodges, commander of U.S.
[02:17:27.062 --> 02:17:29.565]  Army Europe, visited Ukraine.
[02:17:30.525 --> 02:17:33.688]  He announced that U.S.
[02:17:33.768 --> 02:17:37.472]  trainers would now officially be coming, not just unofficially coming.
[02:17:38.433 --> 02:17:44.979]  I'm very happy to be in Ukraine today as my first official visit as commander of United States Army Europe.
[02:17:46.289 --> 02:17:54.132]  I'd like to mention the great privilege I had to visit wounded Ukrainian soldiers today at Pechersk Military Hospital.
[02:17:54.312 --> 02:18:02.875]  He actually pinned medals on Ukrainian fighters, which by protocol of the military is not the way... Foreigners don't get to pin on, you know, medals.
[02:18:03.656 --> 02:18:06.437]  But he did, showing that this was his army.
[02:18:07.257 --> 02:18:14.520]  He then left, and in the Baltics announced that the United States would be pre-positioning armor, artillery, and other equipment.
[02:18:15.513 --> 02:18:19.415]  In the Baltics, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria.
[02:18:20.536 --> 02:18:24.078]  Okay, so he's saying that foreigners don't get to pin medals on people.
[02:18:24.578 --> 02:18:28.020]  And by the fact that he was doing it, he was showing us that it was his army.
[02:18:28.420 --> 02:18:33.023]  And also pointing out, he mentioned the fact that they are going to send troops over there.
[02:18:33.043 --> 02:18:35.624]  He goes, so now they're doing it and telling people about it.
[02:18:35.824 --> 02:18:39.026]  So even he is admitting that this has been going on for a very long time.
[02:18:39.306 --> 02:18:43.310]  I just think it's interesting for people to understand and to hear it from multiple sources.
[02:18:43.370 --> 02:18:45.411]  It isn't like he's telling us something that we don't know.
[02:18:45.772 --> 02:18:56.621]  Nevertheless, the fact that this general would go over there, and we've been showing numerous sources showing that we had involvement in beginning this whole Ukrainian revolution.
[02:18:56.641 --> 02:18:57.662]  We were financing it.
[02:18:57.682 --> 02:19:00.605]  You keep seeing all these videos popping up saying, oh, there's an American soldier there.
[02:19:00.865 --> 02:19:02.487]  And everyone's like, no, no, no, there's no Americans there.
[02:19:02.507 --> 02:19:03.168]  What are you talking about?
[02:19:03.188 --> 02:19:03.588]  That's right.
[02:19:03.608 --> 02:19:05.790]  They even talked to him and he said something.
[02:19:05.830 --> 02:19:08.693]  They call out Blackwater and these guys would run away from them or whatever.
[02:19:08.714 --> 02:19:09.494]  So we've seen that.
[02:19:09.815 --> 02:19:14.199]  And now this general goes over and does a photo op handing out medals.
[02:19:14.260 --> 02:19:21.748]  And so when I saw the Stratfor president say that, when I saw RT say that, I came over and I asked you, what's the protocol for this?
[02:19:22.605 --> 02:19:28.128]  Yeah, so for instance, the last time I was in Afghanistan, I was under the 101st Airborne.
[02:19:28.548 --> 02:19:36.753]  Now they were in charge of the AO, that's an area of operation that we were operating in Afghanistan, in the coast, or Kaus province, however you want to say it.
[02:19:36.773 --> 02:19:40.915]  And just because I was in the 82nd Airborne, I didn't get an 82nd Airborne coin for that.
[02:19:41.295 --> 02:19:46.438]  I got a coin from the 101st Airborne because that's who was leading that mission.
[02:19:46.818 --> 02:19:56.468]  So if there's an American general over there giving out medals or coins to soldiers, then that pretty much says, hey, we're the ones running that operation, just like when I go to Alabama.
[02:19:56.488 --> 02:19:57.529]  Hang on, we've got to take a break.
[02:19:57.569 --> 02:19:58.610]  I want to talk more about that.
[02:19:58.710 --> 02:20:02.414]  And we're going to have an update on Alex's condition right after the break.
[02:20:02.434 --> 02:20:02.975]  So stay with us.
[02:20:02.995 --> 02:20:06.378]  We've got an update on his surgery and his condition.
[02:20:06.398 --> 02:20:06.859]  Stay with us.
[02:20:09.873 --> 02:20:15.637]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.

[02:20:48.838 --> 02:20:55.022]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:20:55.422 --> 02:21:00.428]  This winter season is more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[02:21:09.679 --> 02:21:13.322]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:21:13.743 --> 02:21:19.168]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:21:19.628 --> 02:21:20.709]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:21:20.729 --> 02:21:24.733]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:21:25.433 --> 02:21:38.723]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.

[02:24:19.617 --> 02:24:20.918]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:20.958 --> 02:24:28.482]  I'm David Knight in studio with Joe Biggs and we've been talking about this video from Stratfor and what's going on in the Ukraine.
[02:24:28.502 --> 02:24:32.084]  The very dangerous, conflicting, existential threats between the U.S.
[02:24:32.345 --> 02:24:33.105]  and Russia.
[02:24:33.665 --> 02:24:39.809]  But this is also the beginning of our No Fooling special, running from April 1st, April Fool's Day, through Friday.
[02:24:39.849 --> 02:24:41.210]  We're not fooling, you get free shipping.

[02:25:11.974 --> 02:25:21.662]  Now I said we had a we're gonna have an update on Alex Jones's hernia surgery and his condition and actually let's go to that update right now from Alex Jones himself.
[02:25:22.002 --> 02:25:23.383]  Alex, how you doing?
[02:25:23.723 --> 02:25:25.024]  David, thank you so much.
[02:25:25.064 --> 02:25:27.226]  I tell you, medical technology has come a long way.
[02:25:27.286 --> 02:25:35.712]  We criticize MD medicine a lot, but as I've said, my dad's an oral surgeon and a dentist himself, so he comes from that old school.
[02:25:36.153 --> 02:25:44.399]  When you've got a broken tooth or when you've got a broken leg or you've got a hernia or you've got a gunshot wound, nothing's better than MD medicine.
[02:25:44.900 --> 02:25:53.026]  And I tell you, I had a really bad experience when I was 16 and basically had a compound fracture and had to get a pin when five guys jumped me in the parking lot.
[02:25:53.767 --> 02:25:54.967]  And I was able to deal with three of them.
[02:25:54.987 --> 02:25:56.488]  But then they tackled me and broke my leg.
[02:25:56.868 --> 02:26:00.249]  It took them nine times the level of sedative to put me under.
[02:26:00.269 --> 02:26:03.370]  And I woke up on the operating table, so I had a little bit of a phobia.
[02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:06.351]  But I tell you, this went amazing.
[02:26:06.371 --> 02:26:07.972]  I got in there at 5.30 in the morning.
[02:26:07.992 --> 02:26:09.893]  Had the surgery at 7.
[02:26:10.333 --> 02:26:12.313]  I was awake at 9.30.
[02:26:12.693 --> 02:26:14.354]  Took them an hour.
[02:26:14.374 --> 02:26:17.015]  It was a big hernia because I'd been there for 14 years.
[02:26:18.175 --> 02:26:18.916]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:26:46.525 --> 02:26:49.490]  I'm going to try to come in tomorrow and at least do part of the show with you.
[02:26:49.510 --> 02:26:49.570]  Wow.
[02:26:50.731 --> 02:26:51.513]  So be ready for that.
[02:26:51.553 --> 02:26:54.838]  If I feel worse tomorrow, then I won't.
[02:26:54.878 --> 02:26:56.179]  But I tell you, it's miraculous.
[02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:59.785]  I mean, I left the hospital an hour, two hours ago.
[02:26:59.805 --> 02:27:01.648]  I went to Whole Foods, did some grocery shopping.
[02:27:02.568 --> 02:27:05.650]  I'm back here at the house and I just want to thank my family.
[02:27:05.690 --> 02:27:08.631]  I want to thank all the listeners for their prayers and everybody else.
[02:27:09.312 --> 02:27:22.999]  I know hernia surgery is not a huge deal but at the same time it can have complications so we just pray everything clears up with that and it gets a lot better but I did research with some of the crew and found a Dr. Livingston
[02:27:23.739 --> 02:27:28.385]  Uh, who's one of the best rated hernia surgeons in Texas, if not the country.
[02:27:28.765 --> 02:27:32.489]  So I want to praise God, thank God for that, thank all the listeners for their prayers.
[02:27:32.509 --> 02:27:36.694]  You know, I worry about Joe and stuff when he goes in for medical procedures or anybody around the office.
[02:27:37.655 --> 02:27:40.058]  But just keep praying for the whole InfoWars operation.
[02:27:40.358 --> 02:27:42.641]  We've never had more influence, never had more of an effect.
[02:27:43.301 --> 02:27:47.322]  Again, by the grace of God, and we're definitely over the target in a big way.
[02:27:47.342 --> 02:27:51.243]  And the world's waking up, so it's a very exciting time to be alive.
[02:27:51.263 --> 02:27:51.863]  A lot of tyranny.
[02:27:52.183 --> 02:27:58.145]  You know, just in closing, I know you guys are going to go to break in a minute and come back and finish up your geopolitical analysis and how serious things are.
[02:27:59.445 --> 02:28:03.767]  Look at the articles that are up on Infowars.com today of just what we're dealing with.
[02:28:03.787 --> 02:28:04.547]  We have
[02:28:06.039 --> 02:28:14.030]  Um, city official calls veteran a domestic enemy for supporting medical marijuana, which has proven medical uses, doesn't mean we endorse the abuse of marijuana.
[02:28:14.551 --> 02:28:20.439]  And then we've got university requires students to apply for free speech permits to just speak or hand out student info.
[02:28:20.999 --> 02:28:23.682]  That's why they've had people kicked off campus for pocket constitutions.
[02:28:24.023 --> 02:28:27.046]  This isn't liberalism, this is totalitarianism.
[02:28:27.386 --> 02:28:32.252]  Now MSNBC blames law-abiding citizens for cops' deaths once the Second Amendment banned.
[02:28:32.592 --> 02:28:38.659]  This is an authoritarian takeover, stealing the moral high ground of classical liberalism of Thomas Jefferson.
[02:28:39.279 --> 02:28:44.560]  Again, George Washington was the first major conservative in this country by any historical yardstick.
[02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:45.780]  Jefferson's the liberal.
[02:28:46.020 --> 02:28:48.021]  You can debate their two different views of things.
[02:28:48.841 --> 02:28:51.101]  And you're kind of in the middle of Benjamin Franklin.
[02:28:51.541 --> 02:28:58.803]  But we know, or John Adams, but we know what we're dealing with here is totalitarianism of right-wing and left-wing flavors.
[02:28:59.283 --> 02:29:03.203]  And they found they could sell totalitarianism as leftism because it convinces the left.
[02:29:03.223 --> 02:29:05.224]  But the good news was, I got mobbed.
[02:29:05.284 --> 02:29:06.164]  I mean, probably stopped.
[02:29:06.844 --> 02:29:07.845]  We're good to go.
[02:29:22.913 --> 02:29:24.114]  It's very exciting.
[02:29:24.174 --> 02:29:25.696]  The Globalists are losing control.
[02:29:26.056 --> 02:29:27.598]  That's why they're coming in with total tyranny.
[02:29:27.618 --> 02:29:29.481]  But again, thank you all for your prayers.
[02:29:30.622 --> 02:29:33.305]  And just I really appreciate everybody.
[02:29:33.325 --> 02:29:36.329]  I appreciate David, the great job you're doing, and the rest of the crew.
[02:29:36.730 --> 02:29:38.392]  And so just thank you so much, everybody.
[02:29:38.700 --> 02:29:39.701]  Well, you sound great, Alex.
[02:29:39.781 --> 02:29:45.164]  It sounds like... I'm amazed that you can talk that clearly and coherently that quickly after surgery.
[02:29:45.184 --> 02:29:46.485]  So that's a real blessing.
[02:29:46.505 --> 02:29:51.329]  Oh yeah, they even paralyzed my lungs and to breathe for me so they could untense the muscles.
[02:29:51.549 --> 02:29:54.751]  So I was under full sedation, but I'm all back.
[02:29:54.791 --> 02:29:55.491]  God bless you guys.
[02:29:55.531 --> 02:29:55.832]  Thank you.
[02:29:56.032 --> 02:29:56.652]  Don't overdo it.
[02:29:57.032 --> 02:29:57.733]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[02:29:58.473 --> 02:29:59.574]  We're on watch.
[02:29:59.874 --> 02:30:01.475]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.416 --> 02:30:05.078]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.674 --> 02:30:18.937]  Infowarslife and Infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[02:30:19.157 --> 02:30:23.758]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[02:30:23.858 --> 02:30:28.279]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[02:30:28.639 --> 02:30:31.540]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[02:30:31.680 --> 02:30:33.781]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.

[02:31:09.505 --> 02:31:11.166]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:31:11.466 --> 02:31:15.230]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[02:31:15.690 --> 02:31:20.034]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:31:20.174 --> 02:31:26.901]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:31:27.441 --> 02:31:36.531]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:36.732 --> 02:31:42.138]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA force, just one of the key compounds.
[02:31:42.318 --> 02:31:49.541]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.

[02:32:14.442 --> 02:32:20.327]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:32:20.567 --> 02:32:25.151]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:32:25.331 --> 02:32:28.654]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:32:28.914 --> 02:32:30.495]  No needles, no injections.

[02:33:22.026 --> 02:33:27.336]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:27.416 --> 02:33:32.145]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.875 --> 02:33:41.301]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday, April the 1st, 2015.
[02:33:41.421 --> 02:33:52.111]  It's April Fool's Day, but of course we have to plod through all the information from the government every day as if it was April Fool's Day, because they're constantly trying to spoof us with disinformation.
[02:33:52.651 --> 02:33:54.133]  So it's constantly picking through this.
[02:33:54.173 --> 02:34:00.619]  Now, one of the things that I thought was interesting, and we were just talking about this in the last segment with Joe,
[02:34:01.926 --> 02:34:13.862]  Was going back to the end of January, we had the new general in Europe, Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, who went to the Ukraine and handed out medals to wounded Ukrainian soldiers.
[02:34:13.942 --> 02:34:15.925]  At the time, RT came out and said,
[02:34:16.966 --> 02:34:20.889]  If you've got a foreign general doing that, he's saying that these are his troops.
[02:34:20.909 --> 02:34:25.012]  Foreigners don't get to hand out medals, so he's saying that these are his guys.
[02:34:25.232 --> 02:34:33.458]  And then we had a video that surfaced from Stratfor, where the president of Stratfor, George Friedman, said essentially the same thing.
[02:34:33.518 --> 02:34:43.165]  Back in the RT article, they said, Washington, in fact, just announced that they are sending American soldiers to Ukraine this spring to give training to Ukrainian National Guard.
[02:34:44.065 --> 02:34:50.967]  Okay, so that was announced then, and then they make a public display owning this, because we've seen these reports over and over again.
[02:34:50.987 --> 02:34:55.908]  As you mentioned, Joe, the soldier that they walked up to and he said, go away.
[02:34:56.008 --> 02:34:57.268]  You know, he's obviously an American.
[02:34:57.648 --> 02:35:01.029]  We know that they have troops there, even before they say they're going to deploy them there.
[02:35:01.089 --> 02:35:04.910]  We know that they began this whole thing, taking it right to the Russian door.
[02:35:04.950 --> 02:35:10.951]  And in the first clip that we played from Friedman, he said that the Russians understand that this is an existential threat.
[02:35:11.815 --> 02:35:11.995]  That's
[02:35:27.077 --> 02:35:29.959]  They want to keep the Germans and the Russians apart.
[02:35:29.979 --> 02:35:33.341]  He said, for the last hundred years, that has been the existential threat to us.
[02:35:33.581 --> 02:35:36.102]  So you've got these conflicting existential threats.
[02:35:36.683 --> 02:35:42.846]  And he went on to talk about the kind of cynical, immoral way that they would handle this.
[02:35:42.906 --> 02:35:47.449]  And the guy comes across to me as a real Machiavellian Henry Kissinger type of guy.
[02:35:47.789 --> 02:35:50.431]  I want you to see this clip, and I want to get your response to this.
[02:35:51.511 --> 02:35:52.612]  Cynical, immoral clip.
[02:35:52.632 --> 02:35:55.634]  The best way to defeat an enemy fleet is to not let it be built.
[02:35:56.838 --> 02:36:04.320]  The way the British managed to make certain that no European power could build a fleet was to make sure the Europeans were at each other's throats.
[02:36:05.740 --> 02:36:10.921]  The policy that I would recommend is the one that Ronald Reagan adopted toward Iran and Iraq.
[02:36:12.022 --> 02:36:16.503]  He funded both sides so they would fight each other and not fight us.
[02:36:17.183 --> 02:36:17.843]  He funded both sides?
[02:36:17.863 --> 02:36:22.124]  It was cynical, it was certainly not moral, it worked, and
[02:36:23.875 --> 02:36:24.536]  This is the point.
[02:36:24.796 --> 02:36:28.198]  The United States cannot occupy Eurasia.
[02:36:29.079 --> 02:36:34.222]  The moment the first boot sets the ground, the demographic differential, is we are totally outnumbered.
[02:36:34.542 --> 02:36:41.847]  Well, the ratio in New York of cops to citizens was greater than we had deployed in Iraq.
[02:36:43.476 --> 02:36:44.496]  I don't know if that's good or bad.
[02:36:44.516 --> 02:36:50.899]  You don't want to look at the fact that they've got more cops in New York per capita than we had troops in Iraq.
[02:36:50.919 --> 02:36:54.421]  You know, that's your own standing army issue right there.
[02:36:54.521 --> 02:36:57.822]  But what he was talking about was funding both sides of the operation.
[02:36:57.862 --> 02:37:07.567]  And of course, that's what we have been trying to get people to understand is that the same globalists have been funding and bankers have been funding the both sides of every operation.
[02:37:07.587 --> 02:37:08.487]  That's the way they operate.
[02:37:08.707 --> 02:37:10.268]  There's a few of them at the top.
[02:37:10.908 --> 02:37:15.691]  And they keep everybody fighting amongst themselves so we can't get any changes with them.
[02:37:16.372 --> 02:37:22.196]  I mean, I can definitely see Putin reacting if we actually start moving in, in this large number.
[02:37:22.896 --> 02:37:29.721]  And this whole thing in the Middle East, I mean, the way, you know, based off these videos, that makes it a huge distraction to take away from what the real issue is.
[02:37:30.061 --> 02:37:33.463]  And the real issue has been Russia and Germany forming an alliance.
[02:37:34.704 --> 02:37:48.074]  That makes sense, you know, take the eyes off of what's going on, what they're really focusing on, and just hammer down your throats for the last 10-15 years that it's radical Islam that's our enemy and not the fact that we should be worried about a German-Russian alliance.
[02:37:48.635 --> 02:37:54.059]  And when you look at history, when you go back and look at this and how they wanted to keep Germany and Russia apart,
[02:37:54.779 --> 02:38:07.459]  If we go back and look at the Nazis versus the Communists, everybody in mainstream media wants you to think that these are two diametrically opposed functions, okay?
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:13.203]  That's not true to start with, because they're both very authoritarian, they just have a different argument.
[02:38:13.603 --> 02:38:18.186]  But before you get into that, the main thing is that we had the same people funding both sides.
[02:38:18.907 --> 02:38:22.409]  We had the same people funding Hitler that also funded the communists.
[02:38:23.030 --> 02:38:31.856]  We had Lenin giving a $10 million in gold in a sealed train out of Switzerland and going up to start the Russian Revolution.
[02:38:32.156 --> 02:38:38.503]  And of course the people that were giving him that money were German bankers and people who had ties to the Federal Reserve.
[02:38:38.983 --> 02:38:39.204]  Okay?
[02:38:39.504 --> 02:38:41.266]  That's the way the globalists operate.
[02:38:41.486 --> 02:38:42.547]  They fund both sides.
[02:38:42.567 --> 02:38:45.050]  They fund the Nazis and they fund the Stalinists.
[02:38:45.250 --> 02:38:45.430]  Okay?
[02:38:45.450 --> 02:38:47.152]  And then they have them go after each other.
[02:38:47.572 --> 02:38:51.637]  And I think we need to realize that they're actually doing that everywhere.
[02:38:51.877 --> 02:38:52.037]  Yeah.
[02:38:52.197 --> 02:38:53.358]  Not just abroad.
[02:38:53.498 --> 02:38:54.999]  They do that domestically, of course.
[02:38:55.039 --> 02:38:57.080]  And we are always pointing this out.
[02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:02.584]  Let's play this next clip where he talks about empire and lays this out historically how this has worked.
[02:39:03.965 --> 02:39:05.125]  But I think you're absolutely right.
[02:39:05.165 --> 02:39:07.487]  We cannot, as an empire, do that.
[02:39:07.847 --> 02:39:09.588]  Britain didn't occupy India.
[02:39:10.669 --> 02:39:20.155]  It took various Indian states and turned them against each other and provided some British officers for an Indian army.
[02:39:21.380 --> 02:39:25.182]  The Romans did not send vast armies out there.
[02:39:26.182 --> 02:39:39.227]  It placed kings, like, you know, various kings it created under the emperor, and those kings were responsible for maintaining the peace.
[02:39:40.568 --> 02:39:42.409]  Pontius Pilate was an example.
[02:39:43.829 --> 02:39:49.692]  So, empires that are directly governed by the empire, like the Nazi empire,
[02:39:51.261 --> 02:39:51.501]  Fail.
[02:39:52.402 --> 02:39:53.462]  No one has that much power.
[02:39:54.123 --> 02:39:57.845]  You have to have a love of... of... cleverness.
[02:39:58.145 --> 02:40:00.067]  However, our problem is not yet that.
[02:40:00.967 --> 02:40:02.788]  It is actually admitting that we have an empire.
[02:40:03.889 --> 02:40:06.231]  You have to have a love of, mm-mm, cleverness.
[02:40:07.446 --> 02:40:09.627]  Very, very devious guy, but I thought it was interesting.
[02:40:09.667 --> 02:40:12.588]  He said that the biggest problem is that we don't realize that we have an empire.
[02:40:12.628 --> 02:40:17.811]  Begins talking about the American empire and ends by talking about the fact that we don't realize that we have an empire.
[02:40:18.371 --> 02:40:21.393]  I would say, Joe, that maybe the problem is the empire has us.
[02:40:21.853 --> 02:40:21.993]  Yeah.
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:30.785]  You know, in every one of these examples, you look at Roman history, you look at British history, you know, they had Pax Romana, they had Pax Britannia.
[02:40:31.466 --> 02:40:32.086]  You want a peace?
[02:40:32.106 --> 02:40:34.128]  You want to have security and safety?
[02:40:34.168 --> 02:40:39.912]  Well, you know, one of the ways that you can do that is to have an absolute, unchallengeable tyranny, okay?
[02:40:40.592 --> 02:40:45.354]  People, whether it is colonialism or whether it's the Roman Empire, I mean, that's one way to have it.
[02:40:45.654 --> 02:40:49.295]  When people talk about the fact they want to be secure, we could have a maximum security prison.
[02:40:49.675 --> 02:40:52.436]  That'd be one way that, but you're never secure when you're a slave.
[02:40:52.456 --> 02:40:53.797]  You're never secure when you're a prisoner.
[02:40:54.077 --> 02:41:01.600]  But the way they always do this is they got a few people at the top and then they fill out the bureaucracy like they did in India, the British Empire did in India.
[02:41:01.620 --> 02:41:04.701]  They fill out their bureaucracy as well as the army with indigenous people.
[02:41:05.321 --> 02:41:07.842]  And I have to ask, is that what's going on here in America?
[02:41:08.763 --> 02:41:09.684]  Seems like it sometimes.
[02:41:09.964 --> 02:41:10.845]  Yeah, it certainly does.
[02:41:10.905 --> 02:41:16.390]  I mean, people need to understand, people need to question, really, who they're working for.
[02:41:16.490 --> 02:41:17.190]  Who is behind this?
[02:41:17.210 --> 02:41:26.258]  And that's why we're constantly trying to say, look, these guys are using this divide-and-conquer strategy, they're using it between different nations to keep them apart, and then they do it here at home.
[02:41:26.338 --> 02:41:27.339]  Exactly.
[02:41:27.359 --> 02:41:32.944]  Ferguson, Starbucks, I mean, coming out with this whole race-together thing, that got squashed really quick, thank God.
[02:41:33.524 --> 02:41:33.804]  Yes.
[02:41:34.445 --> 02:41:43.029]  It's never, you know, when you turn on TV it's never cop kills teenager or it's always white police officer kills black unarmed teenager.
[02:41:43.049 --> 02:41:46.171]  It can never just be a cop killed an American citizen.
[02:41:46.211 --> 02:41:52.294]  They always have to add that racial conflict to spark that anger and that's all the civil unrest that's happening.
[02:41:52.334 --> 02:41:54.695]  It's popping up all over the country and they're creating it.
[02:41:54.975 --> 02:41:55.155]  Yeah.
[02:41:55.235 --> 02:41:55.695]  They love it.
[02:41:55.975 --> 02:41:56.696]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:41:56.796 --> 02:42:00.937]  And I wanted to play this because I wanted people to hear it from somebody other than us.
[02:42:01.097 --> 02:42:03.558]  I wanted them to hear it because it is obvious history.
[02:42:03.998 --> 02:42:06.939]  Anybody that looks at history knows that that's the way the Roman Empire works.
[02:42:06.959 --> 02:42:09.120]  They know that that's the way the British Empire worked.
[02:42:09.980 --> 02:42:11.861]  You would go, for instance, he mentioned Pontius Pilate.
[02:42:11.901 --> 02:42:13.701]  Of course, this is Easter weekend.
[02:42:14.422 --> 02:42:16.262]  Pontius Pilate was the real power there.
[02:42:16.302 --> 02:42:17.243]  They were going back and forth.
[02:42:17.343 --> 02:42:18.123]  Herod was the king.
[02:42:18.783 --> 02:42:21.967]  But he was a king that served under the Roman Empire.
[02:42:22.547 --> 02:42:28.413]  So, there you have Herod, the Jewish king, you've got the Jewish government and everything, but they don't have any real power.
[02:42:28.433 --> 02:42:30.255]  They have to go to these guys to get the real power.
[02:42:30.756 --> 02:42:32.257]  It's not as visible today.
[02:42:33.038 --> 02:42:37.400]  You don't have somebody that is wearing a New World Order badge, okay?
[02:42:37.440 --> 02:42:39.221]  These guys are much more clever.
[02:42:39.961 --> 02:42:41.882]  You have to have a love of cleverness.
[02:42:42.203 --> 02:42:43.903]  These guys love to be clever.
[02:42:43.943 --> 02:42:44.764]  They love to be hidden.
[02:42:44.784 --> 02:42:46.725]  That's one of the reasons why everything is so secret.
[02:42:46.745 --> 02:42:50.987]  You're not allowed to know who this thin veneer of people are on top.
[02:42:51.487 --> 02:42:54.869]  You can see who the Quizzling is, you just don't know who the Quizzling works for.
[02:42:55.229 --> 02:43:02.294]  Okay, you know that it's a president, you know it's a prime minister, whatever, but you don't know the guys that this guy actually works for with any certainty.
[02:43:02.654 --> 02:43:06.397]  But you do know that it is the banks, the people who are pushing this stuff.
[02:43:06.417 --> 02:43:09.499]  But I wanted people to look at this and think about how they carefully
[02:43:10.339 --> 02:43:14.823]  Divide these countries and their geopolitical Machiavellian moves.
[02:43:15.303 --> 02:43:23.310]  And understand, as we have pointed out time and time again, with the political correctness and what the media is doing, that's what they're doing to us here at home.
[02:43:24.011 --> 02:43:26.313]  They don't want us to wake up.
[02:43:26.513 --> 02:43:28.114]  They don't want us to realize that we're slaves.
[02:43:28.795 --> 02:43:30.096]  And that's their real concern.
[02:43:30.136 --> 02:43:32.558]  If things hit the fan, that's what they're really training for.
[02:43:32.578 --> 02:43:33.299]  But it's happening.
[02:43:33.319 --> 02:43:35.941]  There is a Great Awakening going on, and that's the... Exactly.
[02:43:36.141 --> 02:43:36.802]  That's the good thing.
[02:43:36.822 --> 02:43:46.013]  There's a lot of people, especially in the military, like we say, police officers, you know, whenever I go out, these are the people that come up and approach me and say, hey, I have a better understanding of what's going on.
[02:43:46.033 --> 02:43:46.413]  I'm kind of...
[02:43:48.436 --> 02:43:56.241]  They stay awake at night because they're like, oh my god, this many years I was fighting for the wrong side, and I didn't quite clearly see the picture.
[02:43:56.701 --> 02:44:04.786]  And now that they do, it's just kind of like this huge slap in the face, and now you've got to like get reorganized and find out, you know, choose sides almost in a sense.
[02:44:05.127 --> 02:44:06.608]  Like, alright, this is what I've got to fight for.
[02:44:06.908 --> 02:44:08.069]  This is where the real war is.
[02:44:08.109 --> 02:44:08.869]  It's not overseas.
[02:44:08.929 --> 02:44:10.270]  It's not radical Islam.
[02:44:10.310 --> 02:44:15.914]  It's here, and it's our government who basically treats Obama like a king, and it is an empire.
[02:44:16.254 --> 02:44:28.025]  Right, everything is so compartmentalized that they don't really understand where it's going until they see a portion within their little compartment that verifies what we're saying.
[02:44:28.045 --> 02:44:30.708]  And then at that point, that lights the fire.
[02:44:30.828 --> 02:44:31.449]  It's like, ah!
[02:44:31.829 --> 02:44:32.329]  This is
[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:51.020]  Exactly.
[02:45:11.196 --> 02:45:11.356]  Yeah.
[02:45:31.983 --> 02:45:33.685]  Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones did.
[02:45:34.085 --> 02:45:39.630]  We go back and we show the videos, we have the links to the previous stuff, so we have to defend what we're putting there.
[02:45:39.710 --> 02:45:40.952]  I think I'm fine with that.
[02:45:41.312 --> 02:45:43.013]  I would be happy if they would defend that.
[02:45:43.034 --> 02:45:50.000]  Instead they just make these blanket accusations and misrepresentations saying that we claim that we had some secret document.
[02:45:50.541 --> 02:45:52.943]  That was never the claim and we showed that in the report.
[02:45:53.303 --> 02:46:06.795]  I want to get your take on the latest development with Bergdahl, but before we do, I just want to mention real quickly again, we've got this new special that's starting at the store, the No Fooling Free Shipping special that starts today on April Fool's Day, going through Friday.
[02:46:06.955 --> 02:46:08.917]  Everything at the store at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:10.318 --> 02:46:18.100]  And of course today and ending at the show, at the end of the show, is your last chance to get DNA Force at 30% off.
[02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:20.801]  That's about $40 that you can save there.
[02:46:21.141 --> 02:46:26.342]  Again, there's Nobel Prize winning studies that confirm DNA Force can support your mitochondrial function.
[02:46:26.762 --> 02:46:30.963]  We all know that's the powerhouse of energy at the cellular level.
[02:46:31.043 --> 02:46:35.704]  That's the way that you build your body to deal with things that you don't even know are going to be coming at it.
[02:46:36.064 --> 02:46:38.445]  The toxins that are in the environment, whatever toxins those are.
[02:46:39.065 --> 02:46:43.586]  One way is to try to address an emergency, as Alex was just pointing out.
[02:46:43.606 --> 02:46:44.527]  He had hernia surgery.
[02:46:44.547 --> 02:46:48.808]  That's what the allopathic AMA approach is good at.
[02:46:49.208 --> 02:46:53.289]  It's good at handling emergencies, gunshots, hernia operations, broken legs.
[02:46:53.789 --> 02:47:00.971]  But you want to get your general health up so that when you're exposed to something, your body is in top shape.
[02:47:01.751 --> 02:47:10.901]  Both genetically, as well as with the nutrients that you've got so that it can respond to that and dispose of that before it gets any worse.
[02:47:10.941 --> 02:47:14.164]  That's one of the best ways to try to maintain your health.
[02:47:14.224 --> 02:47:18.848]  Again, free shipping today through Friday at the InfoWars store.
[02:47:19.109 --> 02:47:22.212]  And the last chance at the end of this show for DNA Force, 30% off.
[02:47:23.959 --> 02:47:30.741]  Joe, there's a new development that just got posted on Infowars.com, a story by Kit Daniels about Bo Bergdahl.
[02:47:30.781 --> 02:47:32.061]  And of course, you've been following this.
[02:47:32.081 --> 02:47:34.621]  You're very angry about this story, rightfully so.
[02:47:35.562 --> 02:47:36.622]  What happened with this guy?
[02:47:36.662 --> 02:47:43.183]  Now, this new story says that Obama wanted to do the prisoner exchange, whether or not he got Bo Bergdahl.
[02:47:43.223 --> 02:47:45.404]  Yeah, on the second page right here, I'll read a little.
[02:47:46.684 --> 02:48:00.135]  The President initially only asked the Taliban to open up a political office in Qatar to conduct peace negotiations in exchange for the five prisoners, but had to modify the deal to include Bergdahl to appease intelligence officials.
[02:48:00.953 --> 02:48:01.273]  There you go.
[02:48:17.992 --> 02:48:33.117]  He's in completely, totally fine health, but the, you know, Fox News, everyone's coming out saying, oh, this guy's withered away, he could barely walk, but you could clearly see in the footage, he's getting out of the little Toyota Helux truck that Taliban has, walks on his own, he doesn't need any help whatsoever.
[02:48:33.877 --> 02:48:34.377]  I don't know.
[02:48:51.556 --> 02:48:51.636]  It's
[02:49:13.110 --> 02:49:14.271]  Didn't like what we were doing.
[02:49:14.291 --> 02:49:16.853]  He essentially just got up and left and was a deserter.
[02:49:16.873 --> 02:49:27.460]  So you're going to tell me that with all that stuff going on and the fact that they made these soldiers swear a non-disclosure, which is unheard of in regular army.
[02:49:27.500 --> 02:49:31.003]  That's something that you only see like spec op guys do for missions.
[02:49:31.683 --> 02:49:34.265]  The president clearly knew this guy ran off
[02:49:36.127 --> 02:49:43.392]  And he still released these five top Taliban leaders to go... Well, that's what he wanted all along, though.
[02:49:43.412 --> 02:49:45.013]  All along he wanted to release these Taliban leaders.
[02:49:45.033 --> 02:49:46.714]  But we're talking about the divide and conquer.
[02:49:46.734 --> 02:49:47.814]  This is more division.
[02:49:47.894 --> 02:49:53.098]  You release these five guys, you get them back in the ring, you get them out there leading troops, killing American citizens.
[02:49:53.338 --> 02:49:56.240]  That justifies the reason that we need to keep 9,800 more soldiers in Afghanistan.
[02:50:00.242 --> 02:50:05.665]  Instead of withdrawing them like the president promised he was going to do, this whole thing is complete and total BS.
[02:50:06.005 --> 02:50:09.006]  And it pisses me off that they want to call him Sergeant Bo Bergdahl.
[02:50:09.026 --> 02:50:09.366]  Come on.
[02:50:09.787 --> 02:50:09.987]  Yeah.
[02:50:10.227 --> 02:50:11.227]  This guy got left.
[02:50:11.247 --> 02:50:11.968]  He's a deserter.
[02:50:12.048 --> 02:50:12.648]  End of the story.
[02:50:12.668 --> 02:50:13.328]  He's a private.
[02:50:13.528 --> 02:50:16.210]  He's not even worthy of being given military rank whatsoever.
[02:50:16.630 --> 02:50:24.314]  Well, and we have pointed out so many times American involvement from the very beginning in creating Al Qaeda, the Mujahideen, and the fact that they are
[02:50:25.134 --> 02:50:26.434]  Giving them weapons and supplies.
[02:50:26.474 --> 02:50:29.795]  We saw this happening in Syria as they were trying to build a case last year.
[02:50:29.815 --> 02:50:37.956]  And we were all saying, look, you're giving weapons to these guys who eventually became ISIS and ISIL and now they're going back into Iraq to start that war up.
[02:50:38.316 --> 02:50:40.397]  They're operating on both sides of this.
[02:50:40.437 --> 02:50:45.918]  And of course, now we see that his big push was to get these guys released so he could keep this going.
[02:50:45.938 --> 02:50:47.318]  They want to keep both sides.
[02:50:47.378 --> 02:50:49.058]  We could have taken ISIS out in the beginning.
[02:50:49.698 --> 02:50:53.579]  This whole convoy coming into Iraq and instead we arm them.
[02:50:54.059 --> 02:50:58.046]  So then he goes out, and to put a beard on it, he pulls back a deserter.
[02:50:58.387 --> 02:51:01.191]  And the mainstream media is just fine to tell that narrative.
[02:51:01.472 --> 02:51:01.912]  Stay with us.
[02:51:02.133 --> 02:51:03.735]  We'll be right back with Joe Biggs.
[02:51:09.156 --> 02:51:15.358]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:51:15.818 --> 02:51:23.600]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:51:23.940 --> 02:51:31.782]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:51:32.102 --> 02:51:36.864]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:51:37.204 --> 02:51:41.906]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:51:42.406 --> 02:51:46.268]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:51:46.768 --> 02:51:47.789]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:51:47.849 --> 02:51:51.931]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:51:52.351 --> 02:51:56.733]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:51:57.253 --> 02:51:59.774]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:52:00.234 --> 02:52:01.895]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:52:02.015 --> 02:52:02.355]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:52:02.375 --> 02:52:03.336]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:52:03.596 --> 02:52:05.457]  Good, brother.
[02:52:05.477 --> 02:52:09.579]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:52:09.799 --> 02:52:13.221]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:52:13.241 --> 02:52:17.443]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:52:17.463 --> 02:52:20.005]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:52:20.045 --> 02:52:22.266]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:52:22.466 --> 02:52:24.487]  Super Mill Vitality was developed.
[02:52:24.747 --> 02:52:30.373]  To activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:52:30.734 --> 02:52:33.737]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:52:33.877 --> 02:52:35.379]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:52:35.419 --> 02:52:38.343]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:52:38.363 --> 02:52:39.844]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:52:40.105 --> 02:52:42.547]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[02:52:43.868 --> 02:52:58.093]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.

[02:54:20.310 --> 02:54:22.954]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:23.014 --> 02:54:25.377]  I'm David Knight, in studio with Joe Biggs.
[02:54:25.458 --> 02:54:28.642]  In our last segment here, Joe, I wanted to talk about Jade Helm.
[02:54:28.682 --> 02:54:34.310]  Of course, we had Steve Quell on, and we also played another take on it, which was
[02:54:35.191 --> 02:54:39.754]  The one that was a possible explanation that some veterans have sent to us.
[02:54:39.854 --> 02:54:41.955]  Paul Joseph Watson did an article on it yesterday.
[02:54:42.355 --> 02:54:45.457]  Jade Helm, is it preparation for a huge war in the Middle East?
[02:54:45.517 --> 02:54:54.561]  And of course, just rotating this map a little bit, you get a rough correlation to friendly hostiles and people that are kind of on the fence in the Middle East.
[02:54:54.601 --> 02:54:55.442]  What's your take on all this?
[02:54:55.822 --> 02:55:04.707]  I mean, it's a very interesting outlook on that entire scenario, and especially the fact that Iran is labeled hostile.
[02:55:05.287 --> 02:55:16.974]  The fact being, since before I was even in the military, I always knew that regardless of the fact we went to Iraq, the main endgame, the goal, was to essentially move into Iran and put boots on the ground there.
[02:55:16.994 --> 02:55:18.795]  And this is just another
[02:55:20.168 --> 02:55:27.475]  Almost confirmation of the fact of what I've been thinking for the past 12, 14 years, that Iran is the main goal.
[02:55:27.515 --> 02:55:29.437]  For some reason, the CIA, they want to go in there.
[02:55:29.477 --> 02:55:32.260]  They want that place, just like we were talking about earlier on the break.
[02:55:32.520 --> 02:55:33.041]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:55:33.341 --> 02:55:35.703]  For the longest time, Iran has been in the crosshairs.
[02:55:36.124 --> 02:55:43.872]  As I pointed out to you when I was in college, I saw Iranian students that were there getting engineering degrees protesting the Iranian shah.
[02:55:44.412 --> 02:55:45.693]  And they had to wear hoods over their heads.
[02:55:45.853 --> 02:55:48.095]  And I said, why you got hoods over your heads?
[02:55:48.195 --> 02:55:59.765]  And they said, well, because the SAVAK, the secret service that the CIA put in to Iran when they established that dictator, that if they get our faces, they will arrest our families and torture them.
[02:56:01.118 --> 02:56:01.658]  Oh, really?
[02:56:02.459 --> 02:56:07.082]  That's my first clue that we're not always the good guys here.
[02:56:07.503 --> 02:56:10.965]  But the American public doesn't have a history of Iran in the U.S.
[02:56:11.005 --> 02:56:20.412]  that starts with an overthrow of their democratically elected government, an installation of a dictator, and then a repressive regime that was established by the CIA, the SAVAK.
[02:56:21.032 --> 02:56:26.917]  No, the American people's understanding of the Iranian situation begins with their hostile takeover of the U.S.
[02:56:26.977 --> 02:56:27.397]  Embassy.
[02:56:27.477 --> 02:56:29.699]  So it's like, you know, why do these people hate us?
[02:56:30.455 --> 02:56:31.516]  Well, it's our foreign policy.
[02:56:31.556 --> 02:56:32.577]  We see this all the time.
[02:56:32.597 --> 02:56:34.159]  We were talking about that as well.
[02:56:34.279 --> 02:56:34.759]  Yeah.
[02:56:35.880 --> 02:56:38.963]  People are always saying, oh, if it gets bad, I'm going to leave the country.
[02:56:39.023 --> 02:56:41.606]  So I think the scary thing would be our foreign policy.
[02:56:41.626 --> 02:56:44.008]  That's got to be scared of to be outside of the country.
[02:56:44.028 --> 02:56:45.389]  I think it's almost safer to be here.
[02:56:45.910 --> 02:56:46.571]  Well, that's true.
[02:56:46.591 --> 02:56:48.492]  And that's the other thing, you know, as as as.
[02:56:49.233 --> 02:56:52.654]  Watson pointed out, these military exercises have a dual purpose.
[02:56:52.834 --> 02:56:57.455]  And you and I walked through Apia Hill, we saw an American city there, we know that the U.S.
[02:56:57.475 --> 02:57:05.718]  government, even if this is something that is a training for Middle Eastern operation, we know that there is also another aspect of this where they're training to move around undetected
[02:57:06.218 --> 02:57:08.440]  In American cities, undetected by an American.
[02:57:08.720 --> 02:57:12.164]  So there's also a domestic component of this and we see this.
[02:57:12.584 --> 02:57:20.031]  That Fort Lauderdale exercise that we saw a video of, that was to me very horrific to see that being done in an American city.
[02:57:20.091 --> 02:57:23.534]  That is the NDAA being practiced on right there.
[02:57:23.854 --> 02:57:30.858]  Well, I believe yesterday or over the weekend, I did a report yesterday though, on the 143rd Airborne out of Texas, Texas National Guard Unit.
[02:57:31.158 --> 02:57:44.947]  They seized the North Regional Texas Airport over the weekend and they flew in C-17 Globemasters, which are giant, like way bigger than a C-130, bringing out Humvees, mortar, all this stuff.
[02:57:45.327 --> 02:57:49.268]  Bring in all these airborne troops in to seize this area and people are like, oh, this is so neat.
[02:57:49.629 --> 02:57:54.870]  It just reminds me of being a kid and all the military planes flying in and out of this airport.
[02:57:54.890 --> 02:57:56.371]  No, this is all conditioning.
[02:57:56.431 --> 02:58:07.395]  Regardless of what this training exercise is for the military, for whatever purpose it is, this is also a conditioning exercise to see how people are going to react, to see what's going to happen.
[02:58:08.055 --> 02:58:13.097]  You know, they keep calling returning vets number one threat, you know, Tea Party, militias, all these guys.
[02:58:13.357 --> 02:58:17.779]  We're getting, you know, word that the militias are on high alert now because of this exercise.
[02:58:17.879 --> 02:58:20.240]  They want civil unrest.
[02:58:20.260 --> 02:58:20.480]  Yes.
[02:58:20.920 --> 02:58:25.602]  And Sequel thinks that this is possibly the one, that they were planning on doing it in 2015.
[02:58:25.842 --> 02:58:30.524]  Hopefully the exposure is going to keep that from happening, but they'll continue to do it.
[02:58:30.945 --> 02:58:32.225]  So maybe it'll be Jade Helm 2017 or 2018.
[02:58:32.305 --> 02:58:33.386]  After people get accustomed to it,
[02:58:36.867 --> 02:58:39.729]  Then they will roll it out for real, doing it as they do a drill.
[02:58:39.769 --> 02:58:41.189]  That's what we always have to be concerned about.
[02:58:41.209 --> 02:58:42.530]  Well, that's it for today's show.
[02:58:42.890 --> 02:58:47.593]  Again, remember we have free shipping on everything at the Infowars store between now and Friday.
