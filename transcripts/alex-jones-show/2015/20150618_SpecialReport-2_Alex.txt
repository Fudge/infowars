[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.283]  Now I'm not a real big fan of Chris Christie, but I am a fan of what he's done recently when he pardoned Stefan Josey Davis.
[00:00:11.723 --> 00:00:16.945]  This was a young man who was a security guard, you know, trained in firearms, proficient in firearms.
[00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:19.786]  And one day he put a firearm into his glove box.
[00:00:19.806 --> 00:00:22.167]  He was driving down the road, got pulled over by an officer.
[00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:24.768]  He's trying to be responsible, trying to be respectful.
[00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:27.669]  He said, Hey officer, I have a firearm in my glove box.
[00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.450]  You know, I'll surrender it to you now and pick it up at the station later if it's any type of a hassle.
[00:00:31.957 --> 00:00:34.859]  The officer says no problem, takes the firearm, goes away.
[00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:45.867]  Lo and behold, Stefan is charged with a felony and they said you can either plead to the charge or you can face some rather stiff penalties if you try to fight this thing out in court.
[00:00:46.307 --> 00:00:47.308]  So he pledged the charge.
[00:00:47.388 --> 00:00:53.612]  Now, nobody wants to be charged with a felony, especially if you have ambitions to be a police officer, as Stefan did.
[00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:55.794]  So it pretty much ruined his career.
[00:00:55.834 --> 00:01:00.057]  Anybody who's out there knows it's a very tough job market, regardless of your education.
[00:01:00.097 --> 00:01:01.498]  If you have a lot of education, you may have
[00:01:01.638 --> 00:01:04.659]  I obviously didn't fit their agenda like I told you and it's just their agenda was
[00:01:26.974 --> 00:01:33.858]  Black lives matter, but they don't matter here because I wasn't being shot by a police officer or being beat up by a police officer, you know?
[00:01:34.838 --> 00:01:47.846]  Al Sharpton and all the rest of the organizations, they just are not willing to help and it's just sad because a young black man that's coming from these communities, why are they not inside the communities helping out and getting young black officers in there?
[00:01:48.854 --> 00:01:50.796]  Now I'm not trying to bash the NAACP.
[00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:57.941]  They do a lot of good things, but as Stefan pointed out, if it's something outside of their agenda, you know, they don't want to fight for gun rights.
[00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:05.447]  So even though there's a black man who's having his career ambitions dashed, they chose not to get involved in this particular incident.
[00:02:05.647 --> 00:02:10.771]  So I'm very happy for you, Stefan, and hope to see you patrolling your community with some good, competent policing.
