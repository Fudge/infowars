[00:00:12.856 --> 00:00:15.141]  There are four things I want the public to know.
[00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:34.516]  First, when I got to work as Secretary of State, I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.
[00:00:35.056 --> 00:00:35.297]  Nope.
[00:00:35.597 --> 00:00:37.918]  Turns out that first statement is a lie.
[00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:43.501]  Not only did just weeks earlier Clinton admit to using two phones... The big question.
[00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:44.182]  Okay.
[00:00:46.104 --> 00:00:47.525]  iPhone or Android?
[00:00:49.926 --> 00:00:50.306]  iPhone.
[00:00:53.507 --> 00:00:55.088]  Okay, in full disclosure?
[00:00:55.428 --> 00:00:55.948]  Blackberry.
[00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:57.229]  And a blackberry.
[00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:06.194]  The Associated Press obtained State Department documents showing Clinton emailed her staff on an iPad as well.
[00:01:06.614 --> 00:01:09.856]  And obviously an iPad is a lot bigger than a second phone.
[00:01:10.217 --> 00:01:16.001]  So Hillary Clinton's excuse that she needed this for convenience shouldn't trump national security.
[00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:26.994]  Now, not only do we see Clinton mixing personal and work chats, here she responds to an email update on drone strikes with some interior decorating questions.
[00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:31.280]  Plus, it seems like she can't seem to figure out how to use her iPad.
[00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:32.582]  Seems confident.
[00:01:32.802 --> 00:01:33.863]  Let's make her president.
[00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:34.664]  Second.
[00:01:35.385 --> 00:01:42.487]  The vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses.
[00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:51.129]  You'll recall that it was actually the hacker, Guccifer, who revealed Clinton's private email address and the fact that she seemed to be running her own secret spy network.
[00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:54.790]  Three men were involved in her private intelligence gathering efforts.
[00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.491]  They were feeding her intel on, among other things, Benghazi.
[00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:01.572]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:08.015]  Now the State Department pledged that they turned over all documents pertaining to the Benghazi investigation.
[00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:16.879]  We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work-related emails and deliver them to the State Department.
[00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:22.480]  At the end, I chose not to keep my private, personal emails.
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:32.482]  Not only did Clinton set up her own private homebrew email server in order to control the flow of information, but it turns out Clinton actually wiped her server!
[00:02:32.822 --> 00:02:42.684]  She admits that she destroyed the electronic copies of her State Department emails on this private server after the State Department subpoenaed those emails.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.545]  She basically told the Congressional investigators what they could do with their letters and with their subpoenas.
[00:02:49.946 --> 00:02:52.488]  She could have taught Richard Nixon a lesson.
[00:02:52.748 --> 00:02:56.171]  So it's definitely not looking good for Hillary that she wiped her server.
[00:02:56.511 --> 00:03:03.416]  But then again, we are talking about a woman who was fired from the Watergate investigation for being unethical.
[00:03:04.137 --> 00:03:05.178]  Are you ready for Hillary?
