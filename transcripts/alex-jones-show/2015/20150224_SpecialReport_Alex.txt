[00:00:10.216 --> 00:00:13.098]  This is Jakari Jackson for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.721]  You guys probably heard about the Waze app recently, W-A-Z-E.
[00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:21.625]  It's a phone app that allows you, among many other things, to pin the location of police officers.
[00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:29.691]  So you're driving down the street, you see a DUI checkpoint, you see some type of speed trap, you can alert your fellow travelers to this obstacle.
[00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:33.754]  And police departments, sheriff's departments in some places are getting upset about this.
[00:00:34.174 --> 00:00:39.739]  They say that the app endangers their officers, it's an invasion of their privacy, all the normal stuff.
[00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:56.955]  And I can understand their concern to an extent because of course we see recently the police shootings up in New York with the officers and it just alerted me that there's a hazard coming up here but as I was saying you know you have the police shooting in New York the two seated police officers so I can understand that kind of concern
[00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:03.057]  But at the same time, these police officers, these sheriff's departments, they're using things to surveil you and me.
[00:01:03.137 --> 00:01:11.059]  You know, they have cameras downtown in places like Austin, Texas, and they say that you have no reasonable expectation of privacy outside.
[00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:17.261]  You know, of course you have all the tracking capabilities in your phone, in your computer, other things as well.
[00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:20.122]  They have people on social media monitoring your posts.
[00:01:20.502 --> 00:01:23.023]  If you say something out of line, they may pay you a visit.
[00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:31.045]  So I think it's a little hypocritical for them to say that they can surveil us, but if we want to take a look into their activities, then there's something wrong with that.
[00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:37.486]  So we're going to use our app, we're going to drive around here for a little bit, see how accurate this thing is, and see if we can actually find the officers using this.
[00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:48.209]  And there he is, right there to the right.
[00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:53.290]  Okay, so here we are, right outside the Cabela's in Buda, Texas.
[00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:59.697]  And the app is telling us that there's an officer up here going north into the Austin area.
[00:02:00.097 --> 00:02:01.798]  So we'll drive by and see if we can see him.
[00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:03.520]  He should be on our right hand side.
[00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:09.384]  Okay, just got our warning.
[00:02:09.404 --> 00:02:11.526]  The officer should be right up here to our right.
[00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:14.369]  I'm not seeing him.
[00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.173]  So maybe this update is a little outdated.
[00:02:20.193 --> 00:02:21.995]  I didn't see the officer there.
[00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:28.731]  Okay, so my review of the app, it does work, it does tell you police locations, among many other things.
[00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:33.596]  Like I said, the app is also made to point out traffic hazards, things of that nature.
[00:02:34.296 --> 00:02:41.984]  But, you know, to any officer who would say that, you know, the app is giving away their location, we're right outside of the Austin Police Department in the Austin Police Department.
[00:02:42.364 --> 00:02:50.174]  It's not on and if you take a quick look you can actually see the windows is still shot out from when somebody came up here a couple months ago and opened fire on the police station.
[00:02:50.214 --> 00:02:51.856]  I'm not encouraging anybody to do that.
[00:02:51.916 --> 00:02:59.225]  I'm just saying if somebody really wants to find out where these officers are they can easily go to a headquarters of a police department or sheriff's department.
[00:03:00.103 --> 00:03:06.471]  So by and large, it's just a piece of a much larger app, so I don't think it's anything to get really worked up about.
[00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:09.976]  The officers are on patrol as they always are.
[00:03:09.996 --> 00:03:14.581]  I'm sure they'll be on guard as they always are, but I don't think it's anything to get really bent out of shape about.
