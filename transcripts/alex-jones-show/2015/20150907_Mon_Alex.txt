[00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.215]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:16.317]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:16.337 --> 00:00:19.439]  It is Monday already.
[00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:24.058]  The seventh day of September 2015.
[00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:27.000]  We have a big retransmission lined up.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.761]  Ron Paul was on with us a few weeks ago.
[00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:32.584]  One of the most powerful interviews, probably the most powerful we've ever done.
[00:00:33.164 --> 00:00:35.526]  Alveda King on the abortion situation.
[00:00:35.646 --> 00:00:39.749]  Representative Matt Shea being attacked by the Southern Poverty Law Center and others.
[00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.770]  And of course, Jim Mars in studio.
[00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:43.592]  That is all coming up.
[00:00:44.672 --> 00:00:54.023]  I will be filing special reports during this Monday live broadcast at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but I'm giving the crew off the day to spend time with their families.
[00:00:54.523 --> 00:00:57.687]  All work and no play makes Jack a super dumbed down boy.
[00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:04.342]  But in the final equation, we have a scientific elite that has bad will towards humanity.
[00:01:05.163 --> 00:01:06.424]  They want to keep people in the dark.
[00:01:06.444 --> 00:01:14.533]  They want to keep us unmotivated and dumbed down and obsessed over simulated warfare and combat like the NFL and the NHL and NBA and all the rest of it.
[00:01:15.213 --> 00:01:17.696]  And I'm simply here to just say, look, this is what's going on.
[00:01:17.756 --> 00:01:18.697]  Here's their own statements.
[00:01:18.737 --> 00:01:19.678]  Here's their own admissions.
[00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:21.200]  What are you going to do about it?
[00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:32.185]  I mean, we've got the Pope and world government running around saying the West has to accept all these illegals that are refugees caused by turning loose radical Islamists.
[00:01:32.265 --> 00:01:35.829]  I mean, that's a report Kit Daniels has got coming up in about 15 seconds.
[00:01:37.227 --> 00:01:48.661]  But the biggest thing we can all do is just decide we're not submitting and spread the word and say no to globalists and vote with our dollars before the cashless society comes fully into place and what really matters is getting our souls in line.
[00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:52.065]  Here's this Kent Daniels report straight ahead in the full broadcast.
[00:01:55.905 --> 00:02:09.035]  Obama's Justice Department accused a Nebraska meatpacking plant of racism because the company dared to ask its employees for their legal status, despite the fact that feds have raided similar plants in the past for hiring illegal aliens.
[00:02:09.675 --> 00:02:12.557]  The DOJ claimed that Nebraska Beef Ltd.
[00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.259]  required non-U.S.
[00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.101]  citizens, but not their similarly situated U.S.
[00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:23.586]  citizens, to present specific documentary proof of their immigration status to verify their employment eligibility.
[00:02:24.286 --> 00:02:40.677]  With the Feds breathing down its neck, the business, Nebraska Beef LTD, agreed to pay Uncle Sam a $200,000 civil penalty and establish an uncapped backpay fund to compensate individuals who lost wages because they couldn't prove they were in the country legally, the Judicial Watch reported.
[00:02:41.417 --> 00:02:46.581]  Additionally, the business will undergo compliance monitoring, which means Big Brother will be watching very closely.
[00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:57.349]  The head of the DOJ Civil Rights Division explains that the agency is on a mission to eliminate unnecessary and discriminatory barriers to employment so workers can support their family and contribute to the U.S.
[00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:57.809]  economy.
[00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.030]  You heard that right.
[00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.676]  The Justice Department is actually preventing companies to fire employees because they're legal aliens.
[00:03:07.617 --> 00:03:09.018]  This is completely ridiculous.
[00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.721]  I mean, back in 2006, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement
[00:03:13.562 --> 00:03:14.182]  We're good to go.
[00:03:41.147 --> 00:03:47.971]  They needed to back off of enforcing immigration laws, which basically opened the border for illegal aliens and human traffickers and what have you.
[00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:52.834]  And when a lot of these illegal aliens crossed the border, they got detained by Border Patrol.
[00:03:53.694 --> 00:03:58.837]  And after several weeks, Border Patrol actually bought them bus tickets to ship them wherever they wanted to go in the country.
[00:03:59.377 --> 00:04:04.400]  So let's say you had an illegal alien that got to McAllen, you know, got detained in McAllen for like three weeks.
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.243]  The Border Patrol actually took them to the bus station, bought them tickets.
[00:04:10.293 --> 00:04:16.257]  To say San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, Denver, Wisconsin, wherever they wanted to go.
[00:04:16.277 --> 00:04:22.701]  And in exchange for the bus tickets, the illegal aliens were given these immigration court dates that they promised to appear to.
[00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:27.924]  But a lot of these court dates were like three or four years in advance and 90% of the illegal aliens are not going to show up anyway.
[00:04:28.604 --> 00:04:36.607]  So now what we have is phase two where the Obama administration is scaring companies away from even questioning the legal status of their employees.
[00:04:37.428 --> 00:04:46.752]  So once the illegal aliens get into the country and get settled in, get jobs, get families, what have you, then they don't even have to worry about ever getting deported because they're never going to risk losing their job.
[00:04:47.272 --> 00:04:49.973]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com.
[00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:09.647]  Today's example of terror porn is brought to you by the FBI, whose agents are telling friends and family to avoid 4th of July celebrations.
[00:05:09.907 --> 00:05:10.748]  And you know what that means?
[00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:17.335]  That means if you're an FBI informant, or a friend of an FBI informant, you better not go anywhere this weekend, because you're probably going to be set up.
[00:05:17.596 --> 00:05:18.337]  Why do I say that?
[00:05:18.697 --> 00:05:23.042]  Back in 2012, the New York Times published an article, Terrorist Plots Hatched by the FBI.
[00:05:23.502 --> 00:05:28.745]  Which details how FBI informants were recruiting people for terror plots, which were then busted by the FBI.
[00:05:29.226 --> 00:05:34.989]  And remember, back in February, an FBI official said, we need to keep fear alive to justify terror budget.
[00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:43.695]  The quote is from a documentary entitled The Newburgh Sting, which tells how the Feds convinced four poverty-stricken New York men to become involved in an informant-led terror plot.
[00:05:44.295 --> 00:05:49.719]  The paid FBI informant is alleged to have offered the destitute men a quarter of a million dollars to execute an attack.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.690]  We'll be talking about this and more on the InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:57.140]  So celebrate the 4th of July, but not if you're an FBI informant.
[00:06:01.346 --> 00:06:03.768]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:03.968 --> 00:06:04.989]  Check it out today.
[00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:13.655]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none, and that's what you'll find at Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:13.856 --> 00:06:20.981]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:06:21.602 --> 00:06:23.944]  Or because they're not 100% organic.
[00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:30.550]  Or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:37.136]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality.
[00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:40.800]  Lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:51.550]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.
[00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:59.518]  Folks, check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[00:07:01.135 --> 00:07:02.055]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:07:02.095 --> 00:07:02.516]  Good, brother.
[00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:04.336]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:06.157]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:07:06.337 --> 00:07:10.359]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:12.940]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.221]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:23.304]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:07:23.464 --> 00:07:26.688]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:07:26.829 --> 00:07:28.331]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:07:28.351 --> 00:07:32.797]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[00:07:33.057 --> 00:07:38.865]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:07:39.105 --> 00:07:40.706]  Or maximum potency.
[00:07:40.886 --> 00:07:47.048]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience.
[00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:51.050]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.851]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:07:52.891 --> 00:07:59.834]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:08:04.304 --> 00:08:09.929]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.553 --> 00:08:27.543]  Joining us from his television studios in the great state of Texas, former congressman, medical doctor, veteran, Ron Paul joins us for the next 20 minutes or so.
[00:08:29.153 --> 00:08:33.897]  Instituteforpeaceandprosperity.org is his powerful think tank website.
[00:08:34.358 --> 00:08:37.821]  He of course does his daily TV and radio show vignettes.
[00:08:38.381 --> 00:08:41.344]  And he's got a new book coming out, Swords into Plowshares.
[00:08:41.664 --> 00:08:44.727]  We'll obviously have him on as soon as that comes out.
[00:08:44.827 --> 00:08:51.153]  But more active, probably more effective now than anybody else in the world fighting collectivism.
[00:08:52.538 --> 00:08:59.421]  He'll go down in history undoubtedly as greater in the fight for liberty than even an Alexander Schultz and a modern Thomas Jefferson.
[00:08:59.721 --> 00:09:08.024]  And he's a humble man, and he won't say those things about himself, and even the movement won't say those things, because libertarians are humble.
[00:09:08.224 --> 00:09:09.165]  Conservatives are humble.
[00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:10.506]  Patriots are humble.
[00:09:10.806 --> 00:09:24.754]  But we have to celebrate our leaders and celebrate that he was Dr. No 20-something years ago, never won anything, never got co-sponsors, and then by the time he left Congress, much of the Tea Party movement had adopted his Americana ideas.
[00:09:25.174 --> 00:09:27.316]  That said, former Congressman Ron Paul joins us.
[00:09:27.676 --> 00:09:29.017]  I want to cover the waterfront
[00:09:30.842 --> 00:09:38.847]  First off, a few weeks ago you put out an alert saying that get ready for serious crises in the stock market.
[00:09:40.208 --> 00:09:43.050]  You talked about problems in the bond market.
[00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.432]  You said a day of reckoning was coming.
[00:09:45.452 --> 00:09:46.913]  We're getting closer to the big event.
[00:09:47.233 --> 00:09:58.381]  In your own words, being a Von Mise Institute fellow, being on the banking committee, understanding the inside baseball, is the day of judgment for the Federal Reserve and other private central banks coming?
[00:10:01.448 --> 00:10:05.890]  Yeah, I think for that not to come would be a surprise to me.
[00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.172]  And you've been involved in this a long time.
[00:10:08.192 --> 00:10:11.253]  I mean, it wasn't like you didn't know what was happening with the housing bubble.
[00:10:11.733 --> 00:10:13.494]  And we had the Nasdaq bubble.
[00:10:14.095 --> 00:10:16.156]  And now we have other bubbles.
[00:10:16.176 --> 00:10:17.797]  We still have another stock market bubble.
[00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:19.597]  And there's another housing bubble going on.
[00:10:19.637 --> 00:10:21.819]  But the big bubble, I think, is in the bond bubble.
[00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:26.341]  It's been going on for 35 years, taking interest rates from 21% down to actually negative.
[00:10:28.522 --> 00:10:30.043]  And they've been getting away with it.
[00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:32.143]  So this means distortion.
[00:10:32.183 --> 00:10:36.565]  Not only is there money involved, but it distorted all the investment over these periods of time.
[00:10:36.925 --> 00:10:39.626]  And the biggest distortion that it encourages is debt.
[00:10:39.926 --> 00:10:43.267]  It encourages debt for a lot of people, but in particular, government.
[00:10:43.807 --> 00:10:52.310]  And as long as our government is able to print the reserve currency, it's going to limp along, even though our economy is limping along.
[00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.631]  But that will come to an end.
[00:10:54.411 --> 00:10:58.212]  And right now we're starting to see the whole thing coming apart.
[00:10:58.252 --> 00:11:01.133]  I mean, we look at Detroit as an example.
[00:11:01.273 --> 00:11:02.733]  We see what's happening in Greece.
[00:11:02.993 --> 00:11:09.674]  They're worrying about what's going to happen, you know, after Greece is recognized as actually totally bankrupt.
[00:11:09.854 --> 00:11:10.995]  There'll be other countries.
[00:11:11.515 --> 00:11:13.535]  This distortion has been going on for so long.
[00:11:13.595 --> 00:11:21.257]  Most people think that when governments print money, that the only thing that happens is that prices go up as a consequence of inflation.
[00:11:21.357 --> 00:11:25.621]  And a lot of that is true, and it's a serious problem and destroys the middle class and the poor.
[00:11:26.341 --> 00:11:38.232]  But to me, the bigger distortion is the lack of pricing for money and causing people to do dumb things, and that's why they overbuild and overinvest and governments overspend.
[00:11:38.252 --> 00:11:47.960]  And then you have the Keynesians still in charge that says the solution for this is just to spend more money and print more money, and that's coming to an end.
[00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:51.603]  The Day of Reckoning is at hand.
[00:11:53.784 --> 00:11:58.608]  Undoubtedly, the Day of Reckoning came a long time ago for Greece and areas of Africa and Latin America.
[00:11:58.648 --> 00:12:11.216]  There seems to be this arrogant idea that it can't ever happen here, but if you look at the real numbers, 0.2 growth, that's what the Cook numbers, for most Americans we've been in a very long recession.
[00:12:14.198 --> 00:12:27.885]  Yes, and you know, even the figures that came out today on the employment, you know, unemployment down to 5.3%, not recognizing or admitting, you know, that 646,000 dropped out of the workforce.
[00:12:28.226 --> 00:12:33.649]  And we have more people, 93 million people unemployed and out of the workforce.
[00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:37.871]  And that if you look at full-time jobs, it's a disaster.
[00:12:38.251 --> 00:12:47.299]  Even though they claim there were a lot of new jobs, but they were part-time jobs, so there's a few new jobs, and then they fudge the unemployment figures, but it's all, you know, in the system.
[00:12:47.339 --> 00:12:57.327]  And even the people who know these are fudge figures still play along because they know that the majority will play along, and they think there's another buck to be made, you know, in trading.
[00:12:57.708 --> 00:13:03.533]  But the markets are more powerful than the Fed, and in governments, and markets will rule.
[00:13:04.213 --> 00:13:04.614]  I don't know.
[00:13:21.253 --> 00:13:23.115]  An ounce, and that was not true.
[00:13:23.575 --> 00:13:37.185]  So the governments will lie to us, they'll get away with it for a long time, there will be an illusion and a false trust, and we will benefit tremendously because we have a military might, and because we have this privilege of issuing the reserve currency of the world.
[00:13:37.645 --> 00:13:47.409]  But you know, the obligations that we have, the unfunded obligations over $2 trillion, you know, $200 trillion, that is not going to be paid.
[00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:53.232]  And the only argument that goes on with these countries like in Greece and others, is who's going to get stuck?
[00:13:53.552 --> 00:13:57.294]  And the bankers are worried they're going to get stuck, and that's what they argue about.
[00:13:57.634 --> 00:14:01.696]  But the debt will not be paid, and we cannot pay our debt.
[00:14:02.036 --> 00:14:03.417]  It's just a matter of time.
[00:14:03.697 --> 00:14:05.818]  But people say, well, tell me when, tell me when.
[00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:12.501]  Well, nobody knows the exact moment or the exact event, but you can tell when the foundation has eroded.
[00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:20.106]  And the foundation, not only of our economic system, but the world financial system, like no other time in history, has been eroded.
[00:14:20.506 --> 00:14:25.428]  And there's going to be serious problems because there will have to be a correction of this.
[00:14:25.468 --> 00:14:29.691]  And you can't correct it with more spending and more debt, which is what they're trying to do.
[00:14:31.243 --> 00:14:37.765]  And then we add the Puerto Rico situation, then we've got thousands of counties that are on the edge or already bankrupt.
[00:14:38.185 --> 00:14:41.786]  We've got multiple states that fiscally are worse off than Greece.
[00:14:43.367 --> 00:14:44.007]  I mean, the U.S.
[00:14:44.027 --> 00:14:46.167]  really is on the same death path as Greece.
[00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:49.588]  And my concern is the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[00:14:49.648 --> 00:14:51.049]  It seems like this bubble is so
[00:14:52.169 --> 00:14:57.572]  Mega-massive that when it does implode, and we're so non-self-sufficient.
[00:14:57.612 --> 00:15:03.274]  Back when your parents, and I guess you as a young man, went through the Great Depression, people were much more resilient.
[00:15:04.155 --> 00:15:06.656]  Now people are not agrarian.
[00:15:07.076 --> 00:15:10.378]  We were 90% rural, 10% urban.
[00:15:10.398 --> 00:15:12.979]  Now we're 90% urban, 10% rural.
[00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:18.742]  If we have a real depression in this country, I just absolutely fear for my children.
[00:15:21.139 --> 00:15:26.144]  There's reason to be fearful because the work ethic is not with us at all.
[00:15:26.804 --> 00:15:28.926]  People believe that they are owed a living.
[00:15:29.306 --> 00:15:41.057]  People in Greece, you know, you sympathize with them to a degree because the banks have ripped off the system for so long, but that doesn't eliminate the responsibility of the individuals who have benefited from this.
[00:15:41.257 --> 00:15:41.777]  We're good.
[00:15:56.505 --> 00:15:59.628]  The IMF is running the show, or the European Union is running the show.
[00:15:59.928 --> 00:16:01.850]  It should be liquidated.
[00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:06.053]  But they're retiring at the age of 56 at full benefits.
[00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:08.095]  And we have that same problem here.
[00:16:08.115 --> 00:16:10.557]  This is what brought Detroit down.
[00:16:10.677 --> 00:16:13.219]  And I imagine every state has a problem.
[00:16:13.299 --> 00:16:17.443]  Unemployment is a big problem, but it's the retirement funds.
[00:16:17.503 --> 00:16:24.609]  In our retirement system, our social security system is not solvent, nor is the medical care system.
[00:16:25.029 --> 00:16:25.870]  It sounds great.
[00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.131]  We're going to take care of you.
[00:16:27.151 --> 00:16:28.732]  It's an affordable care system.
[00:16:29.152 --> 00:16:35.657]  Well, you know, the medical system we're having shoved down our throats is an unaffordable care system.
[00:16:35.737 --> 00:16:41.201]  But the market will eventually rule, and people will have to face up to their predicament.
[00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:48.426]  And right now, people are getting a little more nervous about the fact, you mean those poor people in Greece, they went along with it.
[00:16:48.766 --> 00:16:54.972]  And now all they want to do is get a hundred bucks out a month to live on, and the government has, you know, capital controls.
[00:16:55.032 --> 00:16:56.413]  How much money you can take out.
[00:16:56.954 --> 00:16:58.996]  That has never worked in the past.
[00:16:59.276 --> 00:17:10.647]  It just causes the next country to try to beat the system, so there'll be other countries, including this country, people will try to get out of the system and maybe get their money out of the banks.
[00:17:11.127 --> 00:17:25.211]  Well, for me, that's what really shows us that we're getting close to the big event that you've been warning about coming closer, is that all over the West, elites are hoarding cash, holding gold, trying to restrict the public from doing it.
[00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:33.993]  The TSA announced next year if the states don't have real ID, federally approved IDs, you won't be able to fly an internal passport.
[00:17:34.793 --> 00:17:39.895]  We now have, speaking of medical tyranny, forced inoculations bill signed in California
[00:17:40.655 --> 00:17:44.680]  We've got the Supreme Court now legislating from the bench, clearly.
[00:17:45.221 --> 00:17:47.263]  It seems like the bottom is falling out.
[00:17:48.044 --> 00:17:49.065]  A, do you agree with that?
[00:17:49.626 --> 00:17:51.668]  And then B, where does it go from here?
[00:17:55.373 --> 00:18:12.585]  Well, yes, the bottom is falling out, and this is the big problem, because it's unsustainable, and eventually the people will have to, you know, recognize this, and something else has to change.
[00:18:13.346 --> 00:18:23.433]  The system is not viable, but there's always this willingness to try to prop it up, like we did in 2008 and 2009, we propped it up.
[00:18:23.993 --> 00:18:26.014]  But the debt is illiquid.
[00:18:26.294 --> 00:18:27.674]  It's not worth anything.
[00:18:27.734 --> 00:18:30.155]  The sooner you liquidate the debt, the better.
[00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:32.796]  You cannot preserve the debt.
[00:18:33.296 --> 00:18:42.899]  My argument is, and you alluded to this, is the fact that, you know, this is big problems for everybody and people are going to lose a lot of wealth and even some wealthy people are going to lose out.
[00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:52.368]  But everybody has to adjust to the fact that there will be a change, and there will be a liquidation, and there will be a living beneath our means.
[00:18:52.408 --> 00:18:55.851]  We've lived way beyond our means, but it's what we do about it.
[00:18:56.051 --> 00:18:58.914]  If we keep doing the wrong things, it'll last too long.
[00:18:58.954 --> 00:19:03.499]  This is already, this recession, which is really a depression, is lasting too long.
[00:19:03.959 --> 00:19:10.005]  So if we do this, what we have to preserve is our liberty.
[00:19:10.166 --> 00:19:20.997]  Because if we do, if we eliminate all our wealth and have our liberties, where you just eliminate all those things you just listed here and what our government's going to do, we would be back on our feet rather shortly.
[00:19:21.177 --> 00:19:22.759]  But that's where the real crisis is.
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:37.027]  If we don't build our strength on those individuals who know and understand what liberty is all about, we're going to lose our wealth, we're going to further lose our liberty, and all that's going to be available is some guy walking in with a white horse and saying, I'm in charge now.
[00:19:37.267 --> 00:19:41.630]  If you listen to what I'm going to do, I will deliver you from all the tragedy that exists.
[00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.391]  And it's not a man on a white horse that's going to save us.
[00:19:44.491 --> 00:19:49.614]  It's somebody who understands and gets that 8 or 9 percent that's necessary to lead us
[00:19:50.374 --> 00:19:53.156]  Uh, in the ways of a more free society.
[00:19:53.437 --> 00:19:54.517]  Because that's what counts.
[00:19:54.537 --> 00:19:59.341]  So people shouldn't be discouraged and say, oh this is overwhelming, how are you going to get 51% to give up their benefits?
[00:19:59.601 --> 00:20:00.762]  No, you're not going to.
[00:20:01.122 --> 00:20:13.952]  But you could get more people in leadership positions, and that's where I think we're making some progress, but we have a tough job ahead because we have to convince the majority of people that they cannot find their answers in more government.
[00:20:15.046 --> 00:20:16.948]  Former Congressman Ron Paul is our guest.
[00:20:16.968 --> 00:20:19.270]  Instituteforpeaceandprosperity.org.
[00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.132]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[00:20:21.152 --> 00:20:22.413]  We've only got a few minutes left.
[00:20:23.234 --> 00:20:27.978]  Looking at this, I've brought up the whole issue and you brought up the issue of the financial crisis being front and center.
[00:20:27.998 --> 00:20:37.627]  But as you mentioned, historically, totalitarianism comes out of a collapse and then the countries never emerge out of their hellish existence.
[00:20:38.508 --> 00:20:43.055]  If we have some of our liberties intact, we can quickly bounce back.
[00:20:43.315 --> 00:20:54.490]  But also, war follows that, and we have just extreme examples of funding radicals against Syria, funding radicals against Russia in Crimea, really aggressive
[00:20:55.291 --> 00:20:58.573]  Megalomaniacal, reckless actions by the governing elite.
[00:20:58.933 --> 00:21:00.553]  You've been up in Congress for many years.
[00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:01.634]  You've served the military.
[00:21:02.054 --> 00:21:06.656]  Is it just that we know more about it now, so it seems like the government's more out of control?
[00:21:07.196 --> 00:21:08.717]  Or is the government more out of control?
[00:21:08.757 --> 00:21:13.799]  Because it seems like on every front, they're just power-grabbing as fast as they can.
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.761]  Texas is grabbing its gold from the Federal Reserve.
[00:21:16.801 --> 00:21:17.801]  The Germans want it back.
[00:21:18.221 --> 00:21:21.643]  I mean, if you look at what's going on, it looks like they're getting ready for something big.
[00:21:24.264 --> 00:21:25.744]  Yeah, they are.
[00:21:25.824 --> 00:21:29.125]  And I think the worse things get, the more of this you'll see.
[00:21:30.066 --> 00:21:32.626]  Because they won't admit the problem.
[00:21:32.646 --> 00:21:38.888]  They won't admit that they don't have enough wealth and money to bribe everybody and give them benefits.
[00:21:39.208 --> 00:21:41.049]  And that's when it's coming to an end.
[00:21:41.529 --> 00:21:43.769]  And right now we are facing that.
[00:21:43.889 --> 00:21:47.731]  And I think it is obviously going to be very, very serious.
[00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:52.752]  The governments will do what is necessary to maintain their control.
[00:21:53.232 --> 00:21:54.873]  But it can come out better.
[00:21:54.954 --> 00:21:58.096]  I know what you're talking about, how so often this leads to war.
[00:21:58.136 --> 00:22:02.359]  As a matter of fact, you know, many people say, ah, thank goodness for FDR.
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.882]  He had this World War II and got us out of the Depression.
[00:22:05.942 --> 00:22:07.423]  What nonsense is that?
[00:22:08.504 --> 00:22:18.294]  We had a revolution, and it's one of the rare things in history where the people who were involved in the revolution to beat the authoritarians actually ended up with more liberty.
[00:22:18.774 --> 00:22:24.140]  But if you look at, you know, what happened after World War I and the Depression and
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.163]  Hitler coming in charge and opening up the doors to communism.
[00:22:28.543 --> 00:22:33.006]  But the 20th century has proved that fascism and communism, you know, has failed.
[00:22:33.066 --> 00:22:39.311]  I think it's more apparent to the world that communism of the Stalin type has failed and nobody's advocating that.
[00:22:39.631 --> 00:22:43.894]  But I'm frightened by the people who are carelessly drifting into this.
[00:22:44.195 --> 00:22:49.959]  Well, we need big government, big drug companies, big medicine, everybody in partnerships with the government.
[00:22:50.439 --> 00:22:56.682]  And that is where our biggest problem is and too many people are going along with this because you find that in both political parties.
[00:22:56.882 --> 00:22:57.743]  Yes, sir.
[00:22:58.183 --> 00:23:15.251]  In closing, looking at election 2016, Rand Paul in all the early polls and at CPAC year after year and in New Hampshire and other areas was leading, but by ignoring him and then the guy behind him, Ted Cruz,
[00:23:16.354 --> 00:23:29.926]  They have now basically in new polls focused on Jeb and Trump and I think Trump clearly will get a bunch of more libertarian support and then drag it away from other candidates and then drop out for Jeb.
[00:23:30.366 --> 00:23:33.309]  And then Hillary's campaign head was at Bilderberg.
[00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:36.010]  In Austria this year, we were there covering it.
[00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:38.551]  No one else from other candidates.
[00:23:38.591 --> 00:23:41.933]  So it looks like she's the one that they're pushing for.
[00:23:42.993 --> 00:23:53.799]  Is there any way you see in this upcoming election to reach out to the public and explain to them how they're being conned so that we can get a Senator Rand Paul?
[00:23:54.059 --> 00:23:56.340]  And I know he's your son, but Ted Cruz supported
[00:23:57.185 --> 00:23:57.766]  TPP.
[00:23:57.806 --> 00:23:59.188]  And I'm really upset with him about that.
[00:24:00.209 --> 00:24:02.292]  And your son, of course, valiantly didn't.
[00:24:02.652 --> 00:24:06.717]  And so they're doubling down on money against him, both Republicans and Democrats.
[00:24:06.737 --> 00:24:08.219]  I know you don't want to get involved in the election.
[00:24:08.239 --> 00:24:10.021]  You want to stay neutral on that.
[00:24:10.081 --> 00:24:14.407]  But just as an American, watching another sickening spectacle.
[00:24:14.447 --> 00:24:15.849]  I mean, imagine President Hillary.
[00:24:18.601 --> 00:24:30.394]  Well, it's going to be a disaster, and they're pretty much in charge, and Rand is the alternative to the whole system, because he's the only one that's suggesting that we should have a less militaristic foreign policy.
[00:24:31.235 --> 00:24:40.465]  He's been on the right side of challenging the Federal Reserve System, and he's been good on civil liberties, but the establishment is very, very powerful.
[00:24:40.945 --> 00:24:43.268]  But, uh, and we have to recognize that.
[00:24:43.348 --> 00:24:52.839]  But eventually, though, the only thing that really counts is reaching out and changing people's hearts and minds, and, uh, then the political system will reflect those changes.
[00:24:52.919 --> 00:24:59.387]  Right now, there are too many Americans who either don't care, don't pay attention, or think these wars are wonderful.
[00:24:59.867 --> 00:25:07.691]  You mentioned the wars that are going on, and that contributes tremendously to our bankruptcy and tremendously to building enemies around the world.
[00:25:08.091 --> 00:25:13.954]  And when we get in worse financial shape, believe me, they're not going to be bashful about coming back at us.
[00:25:14.314 --> 00:25:23.098]  So right now, with all the candidates except Rand, they're only going to make things much worse as far as I'm concerned.
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:31.606]  It must be amazing after all your hard work and success promoting Liberty to see your son being the only person out of a field of like 11 candidates.
[00:25:32.688 --> 00:25:36.992]  Who's being called radical just because 50 years ago he'd be called middle-of-the-road.
[00:25:37.352 --> 00:25:43.578]  He's just promoting basic, sane, Americana ideas and I hope and pray that we can get him the nomination.
[00:25:43.598 --> 00:25:50.964]  But regardless, running, he'll help educate people just like you did to tens of millions and the young people are waking up as well.
[00:25:51.024 --> 00:25:57.650]  Former Congressman Ron Paul, congratulations on your successful TV and radio shows and great job your crew down there.
[00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:58.751]  Thank you for all your time.
[00:26:00.882 --> 00:26:01.803]  Thank you, good to be with you.
[00:26:01.963 --> 00:26:02.643]  Have a great fourth.
[00:26:03.264 --> 00:26:09.588]  Wow, well what a great present to the InfoWars audience to have Ron Paul, his first live video interview.
[00:26:09.928 --> 00:26:13.070]  He's been on with us since 1996, hundreds of times.
[00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:17.312]  First time he's been on with us live via video from his amazing studios.
[00:26:18.233 --> 00:26:19.994]  So, just so exciting to have him on.
[00:26:20.014 --> 00:26:25.518]  Again, I don't get giddy when I meet professional football players or basketball players or even movie stars.
[00:26:26.358 --> 00:26:30.740]  And I know some of the biggest movie stars out there, and it's interesting, it's fun, especially if you're a fan of them.
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.182]  But, Ron Paul, I mean, that's founding father material right there.
[00:26:36.862 --> 00:26:37.982]  That's the real deal.
[00:26:39.383 --> 00:26:42.644]  Just a decent, honorable person.
[00:26:43.084 --> 00:26:48.446]  Look how good he looks at almost 80, if you're watching via the free feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:26:50.407 --> 00:26:53.308]  I mean, just a blessed man with a whole bunch of grandkids and
[00:26:53.933 --> 00:26:58.797]  You know, standing up, working harder now than he ever did, his mind sharper than ever.
[00:27:01.499 --> 00:27:07.563]  And then you compare that to the slobs at the Republican leadership and Democratic leadership that are selling this country out.
[00:27:07.603 --> 00:27:14.028]  And Ron Paul speaks every week to packed halls of sometimes 20,000 young people, on average about 5,000.
[00:27:14.189 --> 00:27:17.771]  I mean, he's come to Austin and spoke outside when 20,000 people show up.
[00:27:20.279 --> 00:27:24.621]  That's the antidote to the young people that don't know what planet they're on.
[00:27:24.641 --> 00:27:25.802]  And I want to play again this clip.
[00:27:26.162 --> 00:27:28.083]  Mark Dice is up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:27:28.604 --> 00:27:31.305]  Citizens don't know what country we seceded from in 1776.
[00:27:31.765 --> 00:27:33.246]  Here it is.
[00:27:34.347 --> 00:27:36.788]  What are we celebrating on the 4th of July?
[00:27:36.948 --> 00:27:37.749]  Our independence.
[00:27:38.929 --> 00:27:40.050]  A little more specific.
[00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:43.112]  It's the day that we overtook the South.
[00:27:43.932 --> 00:27:44.693]  And it's the day that
[00:27:45.981 --> 00:27:46.902]  It's our independence.
[00:27:47.022 --> 00:27:47.943]  That's why we have the fire.
[00:27:48.003 --> 00:27:48.543]  From the South.
[00:27:48.743 --> 00:27:49.884]  From the South, exactly.
[00:27:49.924 --> 00:27:51.545]  So it was the victor of the Civil War?
[00:27:51.746 --> 00:27:51.926]  Yes.
[00:27:52.826 --> 00:27:53.627]  Fourth of July?
[00:27:53.807 --> 00:27:54.007]  Yes.
[00:27:56.449 --> 00:28:00.412]  The Declaration of Independence was signed by who?
[00:28:01.293 --> 00:28:04.536]  I don't know.
[00:28:04.556 --> 00:28:05.817]  That's good.
[00:28:05.957 --> 00:28:07.158]  Fast forward to the last guy.
[00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:15.562]  They talked to an Italian guy, he didn't even look like a professor, he's just a hip guy, and he goes, your revolution against Britain, against the colonials.
[00:28:16.082 --> 00:28:16.982]  We all love this.
[00:28:17.722 --> 00:28:19.143]  The world loved it!
[00:28:19.683 --> 00:28:22.184]  Nobody had kicked the British's butt.
[00:28:22.804 --> 00:28:24.165]  They'd beaten everybody.
[00:28:24.645 --> 00:28:25.625]  We defeated them.
[00:28:25.645 --> 00:28:32.768]  Because it basically was, the colonies were British and German and basically Dutch folks.
[00:28:33.956 --> 00:28:34.817]  And Irish and others.
[00:28:34.897 --> 00:28:40.280]  But the point was, is that they'd been in a bunch of wars, and then the British tried to enslave everybody, and they said, no way.
[00:28:40.921 --> 00:28:45.164]  And the whole world marveled at that, and now Americans don't know why you have the fourth.
[00:28:45.604 --> 00:28:47.005]  Talk about dummies.
[00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:51.408]  But that's a group, and those are the Democrats, and that's who they've got on their side.
[00:28:51.668 --> 00:28:54.991]  I guarantee every one of those idiots is a hardcore Obama supporter.
[00:28:55.211 --> 00:28:56.572]  They just go with whatever's trendy.
[00:28:56.772 --> 00:28:57.753]  They love death panels.
[00:28:57.793 --> 00:28:58.853]  They love forced abortion.
[00:28:59.214 --> 00:29:00.735]  They love having their prices increased.
[00:29:02.005 --> 00:29:07.636]  When Obama says 2 plus 2 equals 5, he's talking to his morons, his brain-dead zombies.
[00:29:07.897 --> 00:29:08.738]  Let's go to that clip.
[00:29:09.426 --> 00:29:10.667]  ...celebrates the 4th of July.
[00:29:10.747 --> 00:29:14.569]  Is it Independence Day, when you got rid of Mother England, right?
[00:29:14.629 --> 00:29:14.929]  Yes!
[00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:18.010]  Oh my God!
[00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:21.032]  Well, the foreigners know why we celebrate it more than Americans.
[00:29:21.072 --> 00:29:25.794]  Everybody loves to get rid of their, like, you know, like, the colonizers, so it's always good.
[00:29:25.814 --> 00:29:26.715]  That's incredible.
[00:29:26.875 --> 00:29:27.515]  It's always good.
[00:29:27.535 --> 00:29:28.596]  Thanks for knowing that.
[00:29:28.616 --> 00:29:29.516]  That's incredible, man.
[00:29:29.796 --> 00:29:30.437]  Have a good vacation.
[00:29:30.457 --> 00:29:30.797]  See ya.
[00:29:32.458 --> 00:29:32.938]  Don't laugh!
[00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:34.959]  Don't laugh!
[00:29:37.403 --> 00:29:39.444]  Because this is what they do to people in the public schools.
[00:29:39.464 --> 00:29:40.504]  They don't let the teachers teach.
[00:29:40.544 --> 00:29:41.124]  Don't blame them.
[00:29:41.624 --> 00:29:42.605]  This is what they teach.
[00:29:42.925 --> 00:29:44.385]  This is what they teach, is ignorance.
[00:29:51.408 --> 00:29:52.288]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.768 --> 00:29:54.369]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.289 --> 00:29:57.990]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.686 --> 00:30:09.593]  There is a shocking video posted right now at InfoWars.com where a man dies in a jail lobby after an encounter with sheriff's deputies.
[00:30:09.913 --> 00:30:21.242]  Surveillance footage released by the Sheriff's Department last Friday shows 48-year-old Arlington resident Joseph Hutchison frantically running inside the Dallas County jail lobby on August 1st.
[00:30:21.502 --> 00:30:26.506]  Witnesses say Hutchison was not violent but he appeared distraught and was seeking help.
[00:30:26.827 --> 00:30:29.789]  He didn't have a weapon and he wasn't swinging at the officers.
[00:30:30.209 --> 00:30:35.092]  Witnesses say a deputy threw Hutchinson to the ground and put a knee to his throat.
[00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:38.275]  He couldn't breathe and his face turned pale blue.
[00:30:38.655 --> 00:30:43.838]  After a few moments, he lied motionless as visitors continued to pour into the lobby.
[00:30:44.138 --> 00:30:47.921]  Officers are seen attempting to resuscitate him, but it was too late.
[00:30:48.241 --> 00:30:49.982]  Joseph Hutchinson had died.
[00:30:50.363 --> 00:30:56.447]  His brother James is organizing a demonstration at the Dallas County Sheriff's Department building this evening.

[00:33:02.517 --> 00:33:03.098]  We've got it.
[00:33:03.138 --> 00:33:09.586]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:33:09.667 --> 00:33:11.769]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:14.052 --> 00:33:19.700]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:27.851 --> 00:33:33.795]  Dr. Alveda King is part of Priests4Life.org, a bipartisan pro-life group.
[00:33:34.355 --> 00:33:37.017]  She, of course, is the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King.
[00:33:37.458 --> 00:33:38.798]  She's just joining us briefly here today.
[00:33:38.818 --> 00:33:41.020]  Appreciate her popping in with us.
[00:33:42.101 --> 00:33:50.226]  She's got the new best-selling book, King's Rules, on what Martin Luther King actually said on issues, not what the establishment spins and says he stood for.
[00:33:50.887 --> 00:33:55.250]  And I wanted to get her take on what he would think of Black Lives Matters now,
[00:33:56.645 --> 00:34:00.289]  Uh, basically getting mad at Democratic candidates that say all lives matter.
[00:34:00.309 --> 00:34:02.571]  I thought that's what Martin Luther King said, what common sense says.
[00:34:03.271 --> 00:34:07.835]  Storming these events, taking them over, being Democratic Party funded, George Soros funded.
[00:34:08.236 --> 00:34:13.381]  What does she think, as you know, having a lot of savvy on how politics works, is going on here?
[00:34:13.801 --> 00:34:15.102]  And how big a victory is it?
[00:34:15.122 --> 00:34:17.564]  Because she's a big opponent of, obviously, abortion.
[00:34:18.425 --> 00:34:22.549]  That predominantly targets blacks, 50 plus percent being aborted before they're born.
[00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:26.814]  What does she think about this Planned Parenthood news coming out?
[00:34:27.414 --> 00:34:30.398]  I mean, we got four states cutting their funding, Congress looking at it.
[00:34:31.258 --> 00:34:35.142]  We've known this is going on for a while, but it really is good to see this evil being exposed.
[00:34:35.543 --> 00:34:38.266]  So, Dr. King, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[00:34:39.637 --> 00:34:45.241]  I am so glad to join you, and those are some wonderful questions and things that you pointed out.
[00:34:45.321 --> 00:34:49.204]  The first thing I thought, and you know I come from a family of preachers, Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:34:49.264 --> 00:34:52.346]  is a preacher, my daddy is Brother A.D., my granddaddy, Daddy King.
[00:34:53.006 --> 00:34:53.887]  I'm an evangelist.
[00:34:54.267 --> 00:34:59.631]  But there was a time in the Bible when there was a man named Joseph.
[00:35:00.345 --> 00:35:06.089]  And he became very well known to the Pharaoh after he went through persecution and all that.
[00:35:06.569 --> 00:35:09.491]  And then when he died, a new Pharaoh came.
[00:35:09.912 --> 00:35:11.993]  And then they said they didn't remember Joseph.
[00:35:12.473 --> 00:35:16.656]  I'm thinking that some people don't even remember Martin Luther King Jr., what he stood for.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:18.697]  And of course, he stood for God.
[00:35:18.778 --> 00:35:19.858]  He was a man of God.
[00:35:19.918 --> 00:35:20.859]  He loved God.
[00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:23.841]  And a lot of people seem to have forgotten that.
[00:35:24.241 --> 00:35:28.164]  And that's why you can see young people running up, interrupting a meeting.
[00:35:29.091 --> 00:35:33.553]  Yelling black lives matter, and of course black lives matter, all lives matter.
[00:35:33.973 --> 00:35:34.973]  Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:35:35.414 --> 00:35:37.435]  often taught my daddy, A.D.'
[00:35:37.314 --> 00:35:42.517]  's brother, to, at 1726, the one blood that made all people, so we're brothers and sisters.
[00:35:42.897 --> 00:35:47.859]  And Martin Luther King says we have to learn to live together as brothers, and all that is sisters will perish as fools.
[00:35:48.499 --> 00:35:50.400]  So, they don't remember that.
[00:35:51.155 --> 00:35:57.181]  And so they don't even know that it's disrespectful to go to a meeting and jump in the people's face and scream, Black Lives Matter.
[00:35:57.221 --> 00:35:58.402]  That's disrespectful.
[00:35:58.763 --> 00:36:03.728]  But no one has taught them how to articulate a need.
[00:36:04.308 --> 00:36:07.792]  And because they don't know how, they're doing it inappropriately.
[00:36:08.951 --> 00:36:19.943]  Well, we know the Democrats are directing them and Nancy Pelosi and others, so it looks like they're trying to make the movement balkanize people and look pretty silly as well.
[00:36:19.963 --> 00:36:24.868]  They even go to the most liberal, Bernie Sanders, you name it, and get in their face.
[00:36:24.968 --> 00:36:28.272]  What do you think is really going on behind the scenes here, Dr. King?
[00:36:29.449 --> 00:36:34.513]  Well, where there's envious strife, there's confusion in every evil work.
[00:36:34.533 --> 00:36:38.416]  If you can keep things confused and people can't think, they don't even notice.
[00:36:38.456 --> 00:36:40.697]  Well, they're yelling at the Democrats and the Republicans.
[00:36:40.777 --> 00:36:43.459]  And then you wonder, who's kind of behind the movement?
[00:36:43.499 --> 00:36:44.320]  Who's paying them?
[00:36:46.301 --> 00:36:48.243]  You know, I was elected to office myself.
[00:36:48.343 --> 00:36:50.804]  I was a state legislator, two terms in Georgia.
[00:36:51.185 --> 00:36:53.426]  I've been a presidential appointee and those kinds of things.
[00:36:53.486 --> 00:36:59.991]  And so, when you're in a campaign, you pay people to stand on the corner with your signs, to walk up and down and pass out your flyers.
[00:37:00.492 --> 00:37:04.154]  Well, people don't only do that when someone's running for office.
[00:37:04.234 --> 00:37:07.237]  They do it to disturb a community.
[00:37:07.577 --> 00:37:14.382]  And so, you can give somebody a little money if they go out into the community and scream and jump up and down, and we'll give you some money, we'll give you lunch, we'll give you whatever.
[00:37:14.896 --> 00:37:16.354]  So a lot of that is happening.
[00:37:17.063 --> 00:37:27.870]  And then sometimes young people especially, they'll see something and they'll join in with all this zeal without even examining what the message is.
[00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:29.531]  And honestly, a lot of that's going on.
[00:37:29.952 --> 00:37:37.957]  And you're right, there are people who want anarchy and confusion so that they can continue to do things that they're doing and nobody will ask them any questions.
[00:37:38.097 --> 00:37:39.618]  And they want to set each other's throats.
[00:37:40.179 --> 00:37:43.241]  Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.
[00:37:43.341 --> 00:37:44.762]  And they want to set each other's throats.
[00:37:45.102 --> 00:37:46.363]  We know Hillary has met
[00:37:47.283 --> 00:37:49.286]  Uh, with the folks and try to stir things up.
[00:37:49.306 --> 00:38:03.080]  We know George Soros is doing it, and there are some real issues with the police in areas, but they're really trying to exacerbate it, and I think that's the desperation of the Democratic Party, not that the Republicans are much better, uh, that all they've got now is divide and conquer.
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.204]  I mean, do you agree that that's a sign of desperation, or do you think it's confidence?
[00:38:07.298 --> 00:38:18.795]  Well, I talk about frequencies, and so the political frequency is real and you're there, but it's not so much whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent, but are you a free-thinking person?
[00:38:18.815 --> 00:38:19.516]  Can you think?
[00:38:19.616 --> 00:38:20.378]  Can you hear?
[00:38:20.838 --> 00:38:21.780]  Can you reason?
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.142]  Can you look at issues?
[00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:31.072]  And, you know, if you keep the battle going between the Republicans and the Democrats, that's one level and one place.
[00:38:31.192 --> 00:38:36.814]  But what I demand is that everybody, regardless of their political party, do what's right by people.
[00:38:37.235 --> 00:38:41.797]  And that's why I wrote to the Congressional Black Caucus, for example, and I said, are you paralyzed?
[00:38:42.397 --> 00:38:45.298]  Open the book up for that that says that justice is paralyzed.
[00:38:45.358 --> 00:38:47.439]  People are paralyzed and they can't even do what's right.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.862]  And justice is perverted.
[00:38:50.082 --> 00:38:51.904]  And so, what's your problem?
[00:38:51.944 --> 00:38:55.868]  Why can't you speak out and say that these things that are happening are wrong?
[00:38:56.368 --> 00:38:57.790]  A lot of times, money does it.
[00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:59.631]  Like you say, people throw money at it.
[00:38:59.812 --> 00:39:06.939]  People who are wealthy enough to want to manipulate the agendas, they put enough money out there that people won't even hear what's right and what's wrong.
[00:39:07.558 --> 00:39:07.798]  Yes.
[00:39:08.058 --> 00:39:08.138]  Yes.
[00:39:27.878 --> 00:39:31.000]  They've got us fighting over crumbs while they social engineer the planet.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.802]  How positive of an event, even though it's painful, is it?
[00:39:35.562 --> 00:39:42.326]  What do you think of all these abortion videos coming out and the fact that they're selling baby parts what looks like on the illegal market?
[00:39:43.467 --> 00:39:48.509]  Well, I hope your listeners are really listening because it's very painful for me because I'm post-abortive.
[00:39:48.629 --> 00:39:49.410]  I had abortions.
[00:39:50.299 --> 00:39:57.366]  And when I had those abortions, I was one who sat there and was rushed in and had papers shoved into my hands.
[00:39:57.527 --> 00:40:00.930]  And as they shoved the papers into my hands, signed this quick.
[00:40:01.531 --> 00:40:04.674]  And I'm already not sure.
[00:40:04.694 --> 00:40:06.295]  I'm trying to do it in secret.
[00:40:06.876 --> 00:40:07.377]  All of that.
[00:40:07.417 --> 00:40:08.818]  And then they said, you've got to sign this.
[00:40:08.838 --> 00:40:09.499]  You've got to do that.
[00:40:09.519 --> 00:40:11.421]  So it is painful.
[00:40:12.159 --> 00:40:27.103]  But you know, and there's another video out today, I don't know if you see it, it's called Call Him Emmett, E-M-M-E-T-T, talking about Emmett Till, who in the 20th century, an African-American young teen, was killed for supposedly looking at a Caucasian girl.
[00:40:27.723 --> 00:40:31.844]  And his mother said, leave the coffin open because our people need to see what happened to my child.
[00:40:32.244 --> 00:40:33.705]  And so Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:40:33.785 --> 00:40:37.506]  said, America will not reject racism until America sees racism.
[00:40:37.526 --> 00:40:40.987]  Well, Father Frank Pabon, and I'm director of African-American
[00:40:42.456 --> 00:40:45.597]  Outreach for Priests for Life, where Father Frank is the National Director.
[00:40:45.997 --> 00:40:50.058]  Father Frank says, America will not reject abortion until America sees abortion.
[00:40:50.698 --> 00:40:55.419]  So even though I sit there and I think, oh my God, did I sign that for my own baby?
[00:40:56.819 --> 00:41:00.940]  And you think about it, but I still say, people need to see it.
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:06.362]  I'm looking at it as part, sometimes I have to look away for a second and look back.
[00:41:06.482 --> 00:41:08.162]  David had five smooth songs.
[00:41:09.972 --> 00:41:14.135]  This time, the Center for Medical Progress had five piercing videos.
[00:41:14.175 --> 00:41:18.098]  The first five videos ripped the top off of this thing.
[00:41:18.979 --> 00:41:21.000]  And from there on, the videos are still coming now.
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.021]  So we do have to see them.
[00:41:23.082 --> 00:41:24.362]  They are hard to look at.
[00:41:24.863 --> 00:41:29.146]  But if we don't see the truth, our hearts won't be pricked.
[00:41:29.766 --> 00:41:32.108]  And so I believe that the videos have to be seen.
[00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:36.972]  Dr. Elvita King is our guest, priestforlife.org.
[00:41:37.433 --> 00:41:41.396]  The good news is they tried to get the courts to block the release of these videos.
[00:41:41.436 --> 00:41:42.236]  That's failed.
[00:41:43.017 --> 00:41:46.299]  We now know even more horrific videos are coming out.
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.862]  And it just shows Planned Parenthood and others are not invincible.
[00:41:50.362 --> 00:41:54.805]  I think we're very close to seeing the fall of Hillary, Planned Parenthood, you name it.
[00:41:55.426 --> 00:41:56.687]  If we just continue to push.
[00:41:57.987 --> 00:41:58.407]  I believe so.
[00:41:58.487 --> 00:42:00.908]  There's a book, Abolishing Abortions, by Fr.
[00:42:00.928 --> 00:42:01.608]  Frank Cavone.
[00:42:01.648 --> 00:42:02.949]  It just dropped yesterday.
[00:42:03.849 --> 00:42:10.191]  He's given a backdrop and 20 points of things that we can all do now that we've seen all this.
[00:42:10.391 --> 00:42:14.353]  So sometimes if you see something and you feel hopeless, if you don't have anything you can do about it.
[00:42:14.853 --> 00:42:20.034]  So he's given some how-tos and some lasting things that we all can and should do.
[00:42:20.275 --> 00:42:24.476]  I've got a book too, King Rules, R-U-L-E-S, K-I-N-G, R-U-L-E-S.
[00:42:25.054 --> 00:42:27.757]  And I talk about my own abortion experience in there.
[00:42:27.837 --> 00:42:30.160]  Father Frank did an afterword for me.
[00:42:30.621 --> 00:42:33.404]  And so we need to read, study, get involved!
[00:42:34.899 --> 00:42:36.920]  I agree, Dr. King.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.200]  Dr. King, we're simulcasting, interrupt, I apologize, video.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:45.501]  You know, we're part TV, not just radio, and the guys roll footage in the background.
[00:42:45.801 --> 00:42:53.363]  The new video out today is them harvesting the babies, getting their organs, their different parts, and their little eyes and their little bodies.
[00:42:53.443 --> 00:42:54.903]  Good God, excuse me.
[00:42:55.083 --> 00:42:56.284]  I tell you, it's hard to see.
[00:42:56.364 --> 00:42:57.224]  It's hard to see.
[00:42:57.424 --> 00:42:58.964]  Yeah, I hadn't seen this new one yet.
[00:42:59.024 --> 00:43:00.704]  I knew it was up, but I didn't want to look at it.
[00:43:01.225 --> 00:43:02.785]  Their poor little heads and little eyes.
[00:43:03.877 --> 00:43:06.619]  Is that the lady who had to go and cut the brain?
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:07.220]  Yeah.
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.201]  To get the, uh, I mean... Yeah, to put him in the mice, yeah.
[00:43:09.242 --> 00:43:09.782]  To get the brain.
[00:43:09.842 --> 00:43:10.683]  That's, that's hard.
[00:43:10.743 --> 00:43:11.283]  That's hard.
[00:43:11.483 --> 00:43:12.104]  That's hard.
[00:43:14.429 --> 00:43:15.430]  I know, it's hard.
[00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:16.351]  I'm sorry.
[00:43:16.451 --> 00:43:19.134]  Well no, you were talking about it, I hadn't seen it yet, and then boom, it hit.
[00:43:19.594 --> 00:43:21.376]  What do you make of these manly women?
[00:43:21.396 --> 00:43:29.845]  What do you make of these weird, liberal-type, fake women all gulping wine at fine restaurants, bragging about all the body parts?
[00:43:29.865 --> 00:43:32.127]  I mean, how sickening is how callous they are?
[00:43:32.147 --> 00:43:33.369]  They're desensitized.
[00:43:33.489 --> 00:43:36.492]  That's why they have to drink the wine, because they're desensitized.
[00:43:37.032 --> 00:43:40.033]  And the only way they can go to sleep probably is to get a stiff drink.
[00:43:40.133 --> 00:43:44.695]  I mean, how are you going to keep your heart anesthetized unless you continually do it?
[00:43:45.755 --> 00:43:46.115]  You know?
[00:43:46.575 --> 00:43:48.436]  That's really... So I feel for them.
[00:43:48.876 --> 00:43:49.736]  I feel pain.
[00:43:49.816 --> 00:43:50.496]  I'm sorry.
[00:43:51.317 --> 00:43:56.698]  I pray that they can get to a place where they can live with themselves again.
[00:43:58.399 --> 00:44:04.281]  Don't people at a fundamental level get, just to use this term, how bad of luck it is?
[00:44:06.689 --> 00:44:08.630]  And I use that term, even if you're not a Christian, you get it.
[00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:13.731]  At a fundamental level, it just feels like bad luck for everybody to be doing this to babies.
[00:44:14.231 --> 00:44:15.731]  Don't people know it's going to come back on us?
[00:44:16.872 --> 00:44:18.052]  No, people don't know.
[00:44:19.332 --> 00:44:29.255]  I remember when I was young, I was about 65th birthday coming up, and I remember my mind was, oh yeah, I understand, I hear that happens to people, but it won't happen to me.
[00:44:30.235 --> 00:44:32.736]  You know, you can always tell yourself that, so it happens.
[00:44:32.756 --> 00:44:33.756]  But then you sit there and say,
[00:44:34.266 --> 00:44:35.007]  How did this happen?
[00:44:35.807 --> 00:44:36.508]  Don't you remember?
[00:44:36.768 --> 00:44:37.889]  Maybe that did happen to you.
[00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:42.093]  Sure, it's like people I know that smoke cigarettes and then they don't believe they're gonna get lung cancer when they get it.
[00:44:42.113 --> 00:44:42.934]  They just can't believe it.
[00:44:43.914 --> 00:44:45.676]  And how did this happen, you know?
[00:44:46.276 --> 00:44:51.461]  And so that is part of the human nature as well, and that's why we have to do a lot of praying.
[00:44:51.581 --> 00:44:58.247]  I am a Christian, obviously, but what I say to anybody, whether you're Christian or not a Christian, is there anybody
[00:44:59.159 --> 00:45:03.202]  Well, no, obviously there are people, because they're swilling wine and talking about it.
[00:45:03.602 --> 00:45:07.344]  I was going to say, is there anybody who can't see how bad that is?
[00:45:07.444 --> 00:45:10.747]  But obviously there are some who are still in a place like that.
[00:45:10.807 --> 00:45:11.427]  Absolutely.
[00:45:11.787 --> 00:45:17.511]  Well, the good news is, as you know, the Bible says there's nothing hidden that won't be brought out, even from the deepest depths of the sea.
[00:45:17.571 --> 00:45:18.372]  It's coming out.
[00:45:18.392 --> 00:45:23.095]  I know you've got a new song out, too, exposing a lot of this priestly life.
[00:45:23.135 --> 00:45:24.155]  Pray for America.
[00:45:24.255 --> 00:45:25.416]  Pray for America.
[00:45:25.436 --> 00:45:26.797]  That's the song, and you can see that.
[00:45:27.177 --> 00:45:30.459]  Well, I hope you'll come back with us and take calls for a longer interview in the future.
[00:45:30.499 --> 00:45:31.579]  Keep up the great work, Dr. Elvita C. King.
[00:45:31.599 --> 00:45:32.100]  God bless you.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:32.700]  God bless you.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.700]  Thank you for this opportunity.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:33.960]  Thank you.
[00:45:34.061 --> 00:45:34.221]  Bye.
[00:45:34.301 --> 00:45:34.521]  Oh, man.
[00:45:34.541 --> 00:45:36.762]  That really just freaked me out.
[00:45:56.698 --> 00:46:02.640]  Because I wasn't ready for it, and I'll be honest, I don't watch a lot of the war videos of kids bombed and dead.
[00:46:03.141 --> 00:46:12.544]  There was one I saw just the other day by accident in Syria, where the roof had fallen in on a father and his daughters in his arms.
[00:46:12.564 --> 00:46:13.925]  Looks like she's about six or seven.
[00:46:14.265 --> 00:46:16.366]  I got a seven-year-old daughter, and she's crushed.
[00:46:16.386 --> 00:46:20.908]  You can see him holding her, and you can tell they died together, suffocating under the rock.
[00:46:21.908 --> 00:46:23.349]  And it just gets to me.
[00:46:25.407 --> 00:46:27.968]  And I just can't imagine people that don't have that empathy.
[00:46:28.788 --> 00:46:32.530]  It's like my nerve endings, what happens to somebody else, happens to me.
[00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:40.032]  And I think about that bowl of little kids, and they're pretty good size.
[00:46:40.052 --> 00:46:41.893]  These look like about four or five month old babies.
[00:46:43.733 --> 00:46:47.715]  And their little heads, their little eyes, their little faces, and they're chopping, they're taking the brains out.
[00:46:49.616 --> 00:46:56.060]  And I tell people, 20 years ago they were putting baby brains in pigs, cows, rats, dogs, you name it.
[00:46:57.541 --> 00:46:59.302]  People didn't believe me, now it's all in the news.
[00:46:59.402 --> 00:47:01.663]  It's just so crazy, that's what I mean, and we're...
[00:47:04.741 --> 00:47:13.386]  Got Louis Faircon running around and David Duke running around all... And yes, whites are racist, some of them, and blacks are racist, and Hispanics are, in groups.
[00:47:13.947 --> 00:47:16.148]  And the media's hyping it, and so it's real.
[00:47:16.188 --> 00:47:21.871]  The real perspective of Louis Faircon or David Duke, I mean, I get their perspective from their perspective.
[00:47:23.532 --> 00:47:31.117]  But you pull back from it, it's so fantastical what's really going on, the evil transcends what they can even cover!
[00:47:33.649 --> 00:47:34.969]  And it's happening to everybody.
[00:47:34.989 --> 00:47:41.351]  I think that's the biggest lie is everybody thinks they're getting screwed over or they're screwing somebody over, they're exempt.
[00:47:41.711 --> 00:47:42.491]  You're not exempt.
[00:47:42.551 --> 00:47:45.171]  You don't get away with anything you do in this world.
[00:47:46.792 --> 00:47:49.012]  And I just don't know how people don't see that or know that.
[00:47:50.973 --> 00:47:53.693]  Or why you'd even need to know that metaphysical rule.
[00:47:58.554 --> 00:48:00.054]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls, I apologize.
[00:48:00.675 --> 00:48:02.275]  Kenny and then Brandon and then others.
[00:48:03.394 --> 00:48:04.795]  Uh, Kenny, thanks for holding in Florida.
[00:48:04.815 --> 00:48:06.477]  Ventura's gone now, but go ahead, your point.
[00:48:07.557 --> 00:48:08.038]  Uh, yeah.
[00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:12.241]  Uh, great show today, Alex, and I wanted to plug this ProPure water-filled pressure system if I could.
[00:48:12.301 --> 00:48:15.123]  It makes the best sweet tea, and I even make my ice cubes out of it.
[00:48:15.243 --> 00:48:15.904]  Well, God bless you.
[00:48:15.924 --> 00:48:16.585]  Thanks for the support.
[00:48:17.425 --> 00:48:21.428]  Yeah, man, uh, I just, according to WorldNet Daily, since 9-11-2001, an average of 26
[00:48:23.954 --> 00:48:30.397]  Well, Ventura's got a real liberal streak in him that he just wants to like everybody and he gets that the welfare is wrong and it's a draw, but
[00:48:52.475 --> 00:49:14.315]  He, I'm trying to get him to, he's moved a little bit, and I think it's, next time he's on I'm going to go over statistics with him, and I'm actually going to go over those numbers with him, and just say, look, we're not saying it for the Statue of Liberty, we're not saying we don't like Mexicans, that's not even the biggest group now, Chinese women, Russian women, African women, I don't care, should be able to come here and get everything free!
[00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:16.831]  And by the way, the illegals do work.
[00:49:17.272 --> 00:49:20.074]  But a lot of them game the system and get welfare and then work.
[00:49:20.595 --> 00:49:21.616]  And Walmart does it.
[00:49:22.016 --> 00:49:26.080]  Walmart tells its employees, we pay you enough where you can still get welfare.
[00:49:26.501 --> 00:49:27.562]  Go out and get assistance.
[00:49:28.142 --> 00:49:31.926]  We then subsidize Walmart not paying people a living wage.
[00:49:33.327 --> 00:49:34.388]  So I hear what you're saying.
[00:49:35.649 --> 00:49:39.493]  And Ventura is wrong on that front, and he's wrong on abortion.
[00:49:39.533 --> 00:49:40.274]  Go ahead, anything else?
[00:49:41.468 --> 00:49:42.508]  That's about it, brother.
[00:49:42.528 --> 00:49:43.348]  Keep up the good work.
[00:49:43.428 --> 00:49:44.049]  We love you, man.
[00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.769]  We're praying for you.
[00:49:44.989 --> 00:49:45.569]  God bless you.
[00:49:46.429 --> 00:49:50.610]  You know, I guarantee you that if I get Ventura and make him look at partial birth abortions, I'll get him to stop.
[00:49:52.811 --> 00:49:53.711]  His views and everything.
[00:49:53.731 --> 00:49:55.071]  I mean, he is a real libertarian.
[00:49:57.312 --> 00:49:58.412]  That's really what Ventura is.
[00:49:59.172 --> 00:49:59.952]  And he's a good guy.
[00:49:59.992 --> 00:50:00.813]  He doesn't like the new world order.
[00:50:00.833 --> 00:50:01.813]  He exposes 9-11.
[00:50:01.853 --> 00:50:06.114]  He got kicked off MSNBC and millions of dollars because he wouldn't show up without the war being wrong.
[00:50:06.414 --> 00:50:08.034]  I mean, he's good on many areas.
[00:50:08.054 --> 00:50:10.375]  He's a moral person from his perspective.
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:15.901]  We're gonna go to break, come back with Brandon, and then Anthony, Tim, Barry, and others.
[00:50:18.061 --> 00:50:19.962]  I wish I wouldn't have seen that video, but you know what?
[00:50:20.002 --> 00:50:21.042]  Good job, guys, playing it.
[00:50:21.102 --> 00:50:22.362]  Because after I saw it, I said, you know what?
[00:50:22.402 --> 00:50:22.922]  Roll it again.
[00:50:24.343 --> 00:50:27.963]  And go to m4wars.com and you look at this video for yourself.
[00:50:28.023 --> 00:50:35.845]  And, you know, if anybody tries to censor it on YouTube, which they've been doing, if dead babies getting harvested is obscene, why is it happening?
[00:50:36.585 --> 00:50:38.105]  We're not obscene showing it.
[00:50:38.866 --> 00:50:40.346]  You're obscene doing it.
[00:50:41.533 --> 00:50:47.197]  And I just repent to God Almighty that I didn't do enough to stop the abortions that I've been involved in.
[00:50:49.739 --> 00:50:51.600]  And then my heart and soul just says, that's all right.
[00:50:52.521 --> 00:50:56.224]  In the end, you know, you're going to be tested and you're going to pay for what you've done.
[00:50:56.244 --> 00:50:57.865]  Hopefully only in this life.
[00:50:58.705 --> 00:50:59.966]  I know God's got plans for me.
[00:51:00.006 --> 00:51:00.387]  I'll pay.
[00:51:00.407 --> 00:51:00.847]  Don't worry.

[00:53:35.577 --> 00:53:38.339]  Earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, and more.

[00:54:14.833 --> 00:54:16.634]  Final segment jamming these calls.
[00:54:17.074 --> 00:54:25.318]  We want everybody to go to InfoWars.com and get the new... It's not in the featured, we'll put it there.
[00:54:26.158 --> 00:54:29.280]  Abortion video that's been leaked of the actual harvesting of the babies.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:32.641]  Something Planned Parenthood denied, said wasn't real.
[00:54:32.701 --> 00:54:34.162]  I mean, they're a pack of liars.
[00:54:37.063 --> 00:54:43.606]  And when we're done exposing what they're doing... See, the more hardcore the globalists get, the more we're gonna play hardball.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:51.002]  Evil people always make the mistake of thinking good people are weak and are cowards.
[00:54:53.083 --> 00:54:58.705]  And the truth is, once good people know that they're cornered, they will tear evil people to pieces.
[00:55:00.386 --> 00:55:04.867]  And we're not going to do anything violent to these abortuaries.
[00:55:06.088 --> 00:55:11.850]  We're going to expose what you're doing and politically destroy you.
[00:55:13.482 --> 00:55:18.205]  And I can feel, as the evil intensifies in the world, good is growing stronger as well.
[00:55:18.925 --> 00:55:20.947]  For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:55:21.487 --> 00:55:22.748]  Be part of the solution, folks.
[00:55:22.768 --> 00:55:24.249]  We're in an epic time right now.
[00:55:24.949 --> 00:55:27.591]  The beginning of something that's just gonna get more and more epic.
[00:55:31.433 --> 00:55:32.814]  It's just so exciting.
[00:55:36.997 --> 00:55:38.258]  In a good way and a bad way.
[00:55:39.358 --> 00:55:41.580]  I don't know how anybody could be bored right now.
[00:55:44.588 --> 00:55:46.688]  Brandon in FEMA Region 3, thanks for holding.
[00:55:49.889 --> 00:55:51.269]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:51.749]  Good, brother.
[00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:58.190]  I wanted to touch on the growing police state.
[00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:04.111]  By the way, I'm a Marine Corps Reservist, and I actually shot a video on my phone about a month ago.
[00:56:04.131 --> 00:56:13.493]  I was driving down 95, and I could see what was clearly about 11 or 12 blackhawks in the air, and they actually had a few streets blocked off.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:22.651]  I walked up and just wanted to know what was going on and one of the army guys, he had a ranger tab on his shoulder and basically told me to shut up and get back.
[00:56:25.521 --> 00:56:30.083]  I mean, the more and more I see this, it makes me sick to my stomach, because it's not what I signed up for.
[00:56:30.143 --> 00:56:32.024]  Sure, and it's not the military itself that's bad.
[00:56:32.064 --> 00:56:34.945]  They're being given these missions to condition the public.
[00:56:35.205 --> 00:56:48.010]  I never even covered Watson's article in California, where they had thousands of troops total, but hundreds in trucks, practicing in plain clothes, infiltrating, taking over the town, and then leaving.
[00:56:48.331 --> 00:56:51.612]  They're practicing attacking American cities for America.
[00:56:52.932 --> 00:57:02.658]  And Alex has not even noticed, and I can even attest to myself, when these drills occur, it's never about that jihadi with 50 pounds of C4 strapped to his chest.
[00:57:02.718 --> 00:57:06.160]  It's about that good old boy in a John Deere hat who doesn't want to turn his guns in.
[00:57:06.741 --> 00:57:16.487]  So you've been in the Marines, I videotaped this with the Marines, but in the Marines you have trained to take on, I mean I've been to the drills, they always wear John Deere hats and go, I love America, don't take my guns!
[00:57:16.507 --> 00:57:18.388]  And then the Marines practice taking them out.
[00:57:18.688 --> 00:57:19.609]  You're saying you've been part of that?
[00:57:21.356 --> 00:57:30.302]  I've been part of it, I've seen it first hand, and I mean, to a lot of the guys in the Corps and in all branches, it's like, is this even America anymore?
[00:57:30.362 --> 00:57:36.966]  We're training to kill our own people if they don't do whatever the government says.
[00:57:38.326 --> 00:57:47.372]  And you've touched on it millions of times, saying the FBI and the CIA is compartmentalized at the mid and highest levels, especially at the Pentagon.
[00:57:48.354 --> 00:57:49.855]  I'm the son of a U.S.
[00:57:49.915 --> 00:57:57.518]  Army General, and he's even told me, you know, you either play ball or they're going to take giving resignation and have a good life, you know?
[00:57:57.678 --> 00:58:00.319]  Briefly, where were you specifically with these drills?
[00:58:00.339 --> 00:58:05.721]  Were they in real cities or practice cities where you were practicing taking on veterans or patriots?
[00:58:06.101 --> 00:58:07.641]  Who were you practicing to take on and where was it?
[00:58:09.842 --> 00:58:11.063]  This was a few years ago.
[00:58:11.083 --> 00:58:13.944]  This was, I'm in the, it was in Virginia.
[00:58:15.572 --> 00:58:18.843]  Just a little, I guess about 10 minutes outside of Richmond.
[00:58:20.007 --> 00:58:22.114]  Was it in a drill facility or in a town?
[00:58:23.419 --> 00:58:24.339]  Uh, it was in plain sight.
[00:58:24.379 --> 00:58:25.500]  Yeah, it was in a town.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:36.424]  Now, I mean, I know, because I've shot, or had shot, for me, probably, let's not exaggerate, 40 times, video of Marines practicing to confiscate guns from South Texas to, uh, Hebron, Maryland.
[00:58:36.504 --> 00:58:37.384]  It's all on video.
[00:58:37.665 --> 00:58:38.085]  Stay there.
[00:58:38.125 --> 00:58:39.305]  I'm gonna come back to you, Brandon.
[00:58:39.905 --> 00:58:42.606]  Uh, that's powerful info right there, and powerful testimony.
[00:58:42.746 --> 00:58:46.168]  We know it's true, but just to hear it from the guys that are doing it.
[00:58:46.188 --> 00:58:48.149]  I mean, this is real.
[00:58:48.329 --> 00:58:49.069]  This is crazy.
[00:58:52.236 --> 00:58:57.240]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[00:59:08.287 --> 00:59:11.590]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[00:59:23.118 --> 00:59:25.218]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:59:25.339 --> 00:59:30.061]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:59:30.321 --> 00:59:33.462]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:59:33.602 --> 00:59:36.824]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:59:37.104 --> 00:59:38.904]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:59:39.085 --> 00:59:40.965]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:59:41.205 --> 00:59:43.086]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[00:59:54.275 --> 00:59:56.843]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:07.984 --> 01:00:12.165]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:12.826 --> 01:00:13.626]  You want answers?
[01:00:14.406 --> 01:00:15.306]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:15.947 --> 01:00:19.568]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:20.148 --> 01:00:24.249]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.451 --> 01:00:35.793]  Coming in on the next segment, Joe Biggs, who went out in Spokane last year, is going to be in studio with us with State Rep.
[01:00:35.833 --> 01:00:37.274]  Matt Shea of Washington State.
[01:00:41.448 --> 01:00:45.470]  The Bizarro Sheriff has been up to it again.
[01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:48.052]  And again, we're not covering just what one sheriff's doing.
[01:00:48.652 --> 01:00:50.473]  This is what the federal training has done.
[01:00:50.493 --> 01:01:09.205]  That's why I have clips from Ohio, from Indiana, from Michigan, from Washington, and others, saying we have the MRAPs, the armored vehicles, for the Constitutionalists.
[01:01:10.026 --> 01:01:11.726]  And we have those clips coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:15.007 --> 01:01:16.208]  And we have the special reports.
[01:01:16.408 --> 01:01:19.949]  Police, armored military vehicles needed for constitutionals with firearms.
[01:01:20.389 --> 01:01:24.190]  We point out they're preparing for war, and then they put out disinfo stories.
[01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:30.752]  Oh, Jones says martial law is going to happen by September 15th under Jade Helm, and they're going to confiscate your guns.
[01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:31.252]  No, I didn't.
[01:01:31.692 --> 01:01:33.512]  I said they're training to confiscate our guns.
[01:01:33.792 --> 01:01:35.073]  That's in the Army Times.
[01:01:36.113 --> 01:01:37.313]  It happened during Katrina.
[01:01:37.714 --> 01:01:39.274]  Stop acting like this isn't happening.
[01:01:41.499 --> 01:01:44.602]  Remember like five, six years ago, there's no such thing as a TPP.
[01:01:44.982 --> 01:01:48.926]  There's no such thing as an Atlantic, transatlantic agreement between the NAU and the EU.
[01:01:49.807 --> 01:01:51.028]  There is no global government.
[01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:52.510]  There is no carbon tax.
[01:01:52.650 --> 01:02:03.000]  I have Al Gore in 2007 in Congress, in my film Endgame, looking at the camera and saying, there is no plan for a carbon tax.
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.062]  None of these initiatives have anything to do with it.
[01:02:06.786 --> 01:02:09.348]  And they're like, but you own the company that's going to have the carbon credits.
[01:02:09.628 --> 01:02:12.391]  Now Gore goes, and you also believe there was no moon landing?
[01:02:15.984 --> 01:02:18.586]  Now, notice now, it's all admitted, all out in the open.
[01:02:18.606 --> 01:02:19.627]  The Pope calling for it.
[01:02:19.927 --> 01:02:20.968]  A bunch of countries have it.
[01:02:21.208 --> 01:02:22.429]  They're ramming it through here.
[01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:26.413]  But Al Gore will still come out and say, there is no carbon tax.
[01:02:26.813 --> 01:02:27.974]  There is no income tax.
[01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:29.075]  2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:02:30.056 --> 01:02:31.577]  If you have a business, you didn't build it.
[01:02:32.057 --> 01:02:34.099]  Joe Biden's not going to come after any of your guns.
[01:02:34.359 --> 01:02:35.260]  Remember those speeches?
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.103]  They are a pack of criminal liars.
[01:02:39.824 --> 01:02:41.565]  But it comes down to us.
[01:02:42.806 --> 01:02:43.867]  We are to blame.
[01:02:45.725 --> 01:02:47.091]  For the fact that we are so.
[01:02:51.175 --> 01:02:52.096]  Tolerant of this.
[01:02:52.116 --> 01:02:55.818]  We're going to go to break and come back and go over all of this.
[01:02:57.059 --> 01:02:58.720]  Briefly, didn't plug anything last hour.
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:00.221]  Most shows plug every segment.
[01:03:00.801 --> 01:03:04.123]  The reason I say that is it's important to support InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:03:04.704 --> 01:03:12.429]  InfoWarsLife.com is a subdivision of that with the high quality nutraceuticals because that's what funds about 70% of our operation.
[01:03:12.769 --> 01:03:14.790]  Then we've got Sponsorship and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:16.929 --> 01:03:23.575]  And quite frankly, we're going to have to do some fundraising here to be able to fund the next year, especially with the economy being in trouble.
[01:03:23.635 --> 01:03:24.375]  Everybody sees it.
[01:03:24.395 --> 01:03:25.116]  Everybody feels it.
[01:03:25.516 --> 01:03:27.918]  I know it's hard to support us for a lot of people.
[01:03:28.519 --> 01:03:35.405]  Folks that have means and are upper middle class or wealthy, you're really crazy if you don't start supporting outfits that are fighting for liberty.
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:42.787]  But regardless, whether you're a working man or filthy rich, we have products everybody needs and should use.
[01:03:43.108 --> 01:03:45.791]  Like Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2, game changer.
[01:03:46.211 --> 01:03:49.255]  OxyPower to flush out your upper and lower intestines, game changer.
[01:03:50.456 --> 01:03:55.141]  Prostagard, the highest quality formulation, lowest price out there.
[01:03:56.002 --> 01:03:59.745]  For a high quality nutraceutical that targets healthy prostate.
[01:04:00.385 --> 01:04:06.509]  We also have Silver Bullet that I'm not going to sell out of Silver Bullet this time because it's going to be months and months till we get more.
[01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:10.552]  And I've calculated what it'll take to sell out at regular price over the next two months.
[01:04:11.193 --> 01:04:12.934]  So I'm going to sell what we've got.
[01:04:14.707 --> 01:04:21.412]  And then I'm going to cut off and keep enough back at the regular price so we don't sell out by the middle of October.
[01:04:21.772 --> 01:04:27.997]  This will probably sell out by Thursday or Friday, and by sell out, the amount we have to sell discounted.
[01:04:29.038 --> 01:04:31.680]  30% off one bottle or buy two, get two free.
[01:04:32.461 --> 01:04:35.083]  This is already the highest quality, lowest price out there.
[01:04:36.013 --> 01:04:36.333]  Okay?
[01:04:36.974 --> 01:04:38.715]  So, you buy two, get two free.
[01:04:39.395 --> 01:04:42.457]  You're talking about enough to use currently and a long-term supply.
[01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:44.059]  It stores for many years.
[01:04:44.599 --> 01:04:47.621]  You cannot find a better deal, and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[01:04:48.361 --> 01:04:52.024]  Get two silver bullets, colloidal silver, 30 parts per million.
[01:04:52.064 --> 01:04:54.285]  Get two free, or get one bottle, 30% off.
[01:04:54.326 --> 01:04:55.006]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:02.105 --> 01:05:10.091]  Comedian Bill Burr recently shattered the left-right paradigm of Conan O'Brien's audience and left them sitting in a stunned silence.
[01:05:10.351 --> 01:05:11.792]  Well, I mean, I don't think it matters who's president.
[01:05:11.812 --> 01:05:12.553]  I'm one of those people.
[01:05:12.993 --> 01:05:14.314]  I don't think it matters at all.
[01:05:14.354 --> 01:05:14.795]  It doesn't.
[01:05:15.735 --> 01:05:16.116]  It doesn't.
[01:05:16.236 --> 01:05:16.956]  It doesn't matter at all.
[01:05:16.976 --> 01:05:18.938]  Dude, Hillary Clinton goes to those Bilderberg meetings.
[01:05:20.495 --> 01:05:22.036]  It's like the Illuminati stuff, right?
[01:05:22.056 --> 01:05:30.059]  She probably hooked up with some guy wearing like a goat's head, and then she goes out on TV, and she's talking to people who drive snowplows, like she can relate to them.
[01:05:30.519 --> 01:05:33.740]  Burr also praised Trump for his political incorrectness.
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:42.704]  And regardless of what you think about Trump as a presidential contender, I think you very much should pay attention to what he said about how he's gained the system in the past.
[01:05:43.024 --> 01:05:45.366]  Before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman.
[01:05:45.526 --> 01:05:46.487]  I give to everybody.
[01:05:46.507 --> 01:05:47.608]  When they call, I give.
[01:05:47.889 --> 01:05:48.529]  And you know what?
[01:05:48.769 --> 01:05:52.913]  When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them.
[01:05:53.274 --> 01:05:54.795]  They are there for me.
[01:05:54.895 --> 01:05:56.597]  And that's a broken system.
[01:05:56.757 --> 01:05:59.099]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com

[01:08:04.284 --> 01:08:06.490]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:07.071 --> 01:08:09.878]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:41.374 --> 01:08:46.517]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, now well into the second hour of the World Wide Broadcast.
[01:08:46.578 --> 01:08:51.861]  We have Gerald Cilente, Trends Forecaster, joining us to talk about China sliding again.
[01:08:51.921 --> 01:08:57.345]  Yet today, the Federal Reserve coming in and propping up the stock market.
[01:08:57.745 --> 01:08:58.966]  China did that three weeks ago.
[01:08:59.046 --> 01:09:00.006]  It worked a little bit.
[01:09:00.507 --> 01:09:01.707]  Now the free falls back.
[01:09:01.747 --> 01:09:03.729]  We expect to see that same trend here.
[01:09:04.549 --> 01:09:08.132]  We wish the stock market wouldn't go down, but it's way overvalued.
[01:09:08.712 --> 01:09:12.058]  So we'll be breaking that down in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:19.071]  Also coming up, we're going to play clips of the latest chilling Planned Parenthood video released today.
[01:09:19.091 --> 01:09:20.454]  I guess the eighth video.
[01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:31.814]  That has them joking about trying to buy 50 baby livers a week, and the fact that sometimes they're getting ripped off and they're only blood clots, and they say, you know, what's happening?
[01:09:31.854 --> 01:09:35.355]  Are the dead babies crawling out of their containers?
[01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:37.576]  You know, where are the organs?
[01:09:38.297 --> 01:09:46.480]  And making all sorts of sickening statements, and that dovetails with footage CNS News got of Satanists in Detroit who've put up a Baphomet statue.
[01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:54.452]  Going around in support of Planned Parenthood, and just no matter where you go, Satanists just appear.
[01:09:55.392 --> 01:09:58.012]  I'm telling you, go out, demonstrate, announce you're doing it.
[01:09:58.833 --> 01:10:03.874]  Every time I've done it for 20 years, and I've only done it probably 16, 17 times, Satanists have shown up.
[01:10:04.774 --> 01:10:11.096]  They'll come over and say, you know, I worship Satan, we're gonna kill you, or we're gonna get you, or we kill babies, you're never gonna stop us, and stick their tongues out.
[01:10:12.032 --> 01:10:17.877]  And the thing is, they're so weak, you know why they worship such a pathetic creature as Satan.
[01:10:18.698 --> 01:10:22.241]  Whether you believe in Satan or not, a lot of serial killers worship the devil.
[01:10:22.821 --> 01:10:24.062]  So it shows the mental illness.
[01:10:24.502 --> 01:10:28.205]  Now joining us until about 45 after are State Rep.
[01:10:28.285 --> 01:10:29.046]  Matt Shea.
[01:10:29.146 --> 01:10:32.169]  VoteShea.com is his website and Joe Biggs.
[01:10:32.529 --> 01:10:34.631]  Joe Biggs last year went out to Spokane.
[01:10:36.343 --> 01:10:50.080]  Because it was national news when we played a clip of the sheriff's deputy and the SWAT team at a Walmart saying we have this MRAP for constitutionalists and people who are stockpiling guns, who statistically have the lowest crime rates in the country.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:50.500]  Look it up.
[01:10:51.348 --> 01:10:55.410]  And then we have other clips from Indiana and Ohio and Michigan and you name it.
[01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:56.450]  Same thing.
[01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:58.111]  This is the federal talking point.
[01:10:58.511 --> 01:11:06.455]  You've been given armored vehicles for the veterans, for the gun owners, for the Christians, for the Constitutionalists.
[01:11:06.755 --> 01:11:07.955]  That's national news.
[01:11:09.076 --> 01:11:15.079]  So, six and now it's seven members of the legislature are really great patriots.
[01:11:16.786 --> 01:11:19.188]  They even wear the M4-1776 pin.
[01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:20.069]  They sent me a photo of that.
[01:11:20.089 --> 01:11:20.489]  It was awesome.
[01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:22.431]  We had to dig that up from their Twitter and put it up.
[01:11:22.451 --> 01:11:23.552]  I forgot to tell the guys about it.
[01:11:24.473 --> 01:11:26.715]  And there's just so much data to go over here.
[01:11:27.135 --> 01:11:28.556]  I could talk a million miles an hour.
[01:11:28.596 --> 01:11:35.562]  It's better that I just turn it over to Joe Biggs, turn it over to Representative Shea, and also turn it over to the sheriff himself.
[01:11:35.983 --> 01:11:44.049]  We're not going to play the whole thing, but when we played this video, he came out and said we're liars, that it wasn't for constitutionalists,
[01:11:45.208 --> 01:11:48.873]  And then he came out and said that Infowars was death-threatening him.
[01:11:48.893 --> 01:11:55.181]  And then in his next breath said, that's why we need the armored vehicles for the Constitutionalists.
[01:11:55.842 --> 01:12:01.168]  So this guy is either one of the worst liars I've ever seen or something's wrong with him.
[01:12:01.929 --> 01:12:03.691]  And I mean that very serious.
[01:12:04.411 --> 01:12:05.252]  That's my opinion.
[01:12:05.312 --> 01:12:07.614]  I mean, I don't want to fight with the sheriff.
[01:12:08.195 --> 01:12:10.317]  I'm not some type of police officer hater.
[01:12:10.957 --> 01:12:12.679]  In fact, I respect the office of the sheriff.
[01:12:12.719 --> 01:12:13.259]  It's elected.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.943]  That's the most respectable constitutional law enforcement office there is.
[01:12:17.183 --> 01:12:20.886]  And we have sheriffs across the country, from Milwaukee Sheriff to you name it.
[01:12:21.527 --> 01:12:22.768]  We have the sheriff on all the time.
[01:12:22.808 --> 01:12:23.749]  I've had him on for 20 years.
[01:12:23.829 --> 01:12:27.672]  It launched the sheriff movement to try to get liberty back, of course.
[01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:32.882]  So, it's very painful to see this, and something's going on.
[01:12:33.183 --> 01:12:34.666]  He's either trying to bait us, or...
[01:12:38.376 --> 01:12:42.138]  He's being manipulated by the Southern Poverty Law Center or some other organization.
[01:12:42.538 --> 01:12:49.362]  Let's play the clip that started all this last year of the sheriff's deputy saying it's for constitutionalists.
[01:12:49.382 --> 01:12:49.782]  Here it is.
[01:12:50.243 --> 01:13:00.889]  Well, the nice thing about this piece of equipment is that if somebody is directing fire toward a team that's trying to get in, they can pull right up to a front.
[01:13:00.929 --> 01:13:06.572]  They can take enemy fire and still try to address threat without being afraid of getting shot.
[01:13:06.932 --> 01:13:11.596]  So I'm thinking that is totally appropriate in Iraq, but what kind of a situation in the U.S.
[01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:12.617]  would you see that happening?
[01:13:12.678 --> 01:13:16.721]  I mean, we've got a lot of constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[01:13:17.142 --> 01:13:19.144]  A lot of ammunition.
[01:13:19.264 --> 01:13:23.728]  I mean, we've got a lot of constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[01:13:24.148 --> 01:13:25.410]  A lot of ammunition.
[01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:26.931]  They have weapons here locally.
[01:13:30.692 --> 01:13:35.514]  Okay, and then he said the tape was edited, so we put out the entire 12-minute tape we got from the listener.
[01:13:36.515 --> 01:13:38.015]  But again, we weren't even breaking this.
[01:13:38.035 --> 01:13:39.156]  It was already out for a week.
[01:13:39.196 --> 01:13:40.156]  We just wrote a story about it.
[01:13:40.456 --> 01:13:41.977]  DrudgeReport.com picked it up.
[01:13:42.597 --> 01:13:43.598]  Fox News picked it up.
[01:13:44.398 --> 01:13:51.682]  And then we'll play later in the broadcast other sheriff's deputies at other departments saying the exact same thing with the exact same MRAPs.
[01:13:51.722 --> 01:13:58.785]  I mean, it's chilling to have armored heavy vehicles, wheeled tanks, that Joe fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:13:59.645 --> 01:14:00.446]  In America.
[01:14:01.887 --> 01:14:03.549]  And they tell us it's for us.
[01:14:04.730 --> 01:14:06.412]  The Democratic Party basically does.
[01:14:07.172 --> 01:14:11.156]  And of course a lot of these reps that are fighting back against this are veterans themselves.
[01:14:11.877 --> 01:14:15.320]  And the sheriffs come out and call them traitors and run down their service.
[01:14:16.297 --> 01:14:23.900]  Kind of like when you criticized Jade Helm, they kind of said, oh, he claims he was in the army when they know you were in Rolling Stone, GQ, and in Army Times.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:27.681]  I mean, you were somebody they pushed in front of the cameras because you were in a heavy combat unit.
[01:14:28.301 --> 01:14:31.103]  And then they're like, oh, maybe you were in the military.
[01:14:31.383 --> 01:14:33.043]  Maybe, you know, Matt Shea was in the military.
[01:14:33.063 --> 01:14:33.884]  Maybe these other people.
[01:14:34.264 --> 01:14:36.765]  It's really crazy how they try to deceive.
[01:14:36.825 --> 01:14:38.945]  So, Joe, what do you think is really going on here?
[01:14:38.965 --> 01:14:40.226]  And then we're going to go to Matt Shea.
[01:14:40.566 --> 01:14:47.192]  Well, this guy, this sheriff walks around with blinders on, and the fact that he's using these YouTube comments as threats, we get death threats on YouTube.
[01:14:47.792 --> 01:14:48.152]  Every day.
[01:14:48.573 --> 01:14:49.874]  That's just what happens on YouTube.
[01:14:50.234 --> 01:14:54.558]  I mean, I've got some of them right here that says, I hope your MRAP and your SWAT team takes you down.
[01:14:55.238 --> 01:14:59.502]  You know, this is something that they said that was on an InfoWars comment board that was in the Inlander article.
[01:15:00.002 --> 01:15:01.603]  And then they said that we said this!
[01:15:02.441 --> 01:15:07.785]  Yeah, this is a major cover story that hundreds of thousands read saying we're saying kill cops.
[01:15:07.825 --> 01:15:12.669]  Yeah, anybody can log on to YouTube, anybody can post anonymously and put some kind of comment up.
[01:15:12.909 --> 01:15:13.790]  That has nothing to do with us.
[01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:15.211]  No one at InfoWars condoned that.
[01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:16.632]  No one here wrote that.
[01:15:16.952 --> 01:15:18.253]  So how does that have to do with us?
[01:15:18.453 --> 01:15:24.298]  Well, they're going along with the sheriff because first he said we said it a year ago and now they're running it saying that we're saying it.
[01:15:24.778 --> 01:15:25.999]  Yeah, they're saying that InfoWars is behind it.
[01:15:26.019 --> 01:15:28.601]  We could go on the Inlander and write that and say they said it.
[01:15:28.641 --> 01:15:29.222]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:30.222 --> 01:15:33.565]  So all we're doing is trying to confront the fact that this guy is out of control completely.
[01:15:33.945 --> 01:15:36.568]  The fact that he says he's going to use these MRAPs for Constitutionalists.
[01:15:36.588 --> 01:15:38.049]  What's wrong with being a Constitutionalist?
[01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:41.132]  What's wrong with wanting to stand up for that?
[01:15:41.612 --> 01:15:49.219]  And then the fact that in like some places like in Washington, if you call 9-1-1, you have to say that you're a vet or not because they're going to approach you differently if they come to your home.
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:50.881]  There's a huge problem going on.
[01:15:52.836 --> 01:15:53.757]  It's really crazy.
[01:15:53.957 --> 01:15:58.239]  The people that have hijacked our government want to start a war with people in America that still are Americans.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:15:59.800]  I mean, it comes down to that.
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:05.344]  If you're just mainline, mom and apple pie, you want low taxes, right to defend yourself, private property.
[01:16:06.175 --> 01:16:07.776]  You're just a good, hard-working person.
[01:16:07.836 --> 01:16:15.422]  You're the enemy because criminals have taken over and they're trying to manipulate police now into believing that we're the enemy to have a civil war.
[01:16:15.482 --> 01:16:16.242]  That's my view.
[01:16:16.762 --> 01:16:30.372]  We, of course, can give people the name of the sheriff, talk more about him, get some background on him, but they've got mainstream media, national TV, you name it, really working with the sheriff to demonize the liberty movement that's growing in Washington state.
[01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:32.714]  Representative Matt Shea, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:16:33.334 --> 01:16:35.840]  Thanks for having me on again, Alex, and Joe, good to see you again.
[01:16:36.221 --> 01:16:36.702]  You too, sir.
[01:16:37.784 --> 01:16:40.450]  Tell us your view on all this and what you think's happening.
[01:16:41.155 --> 01:16:43.477]  Well, so this sheriff is completely out of control.
[01:16:43.497 --> 01:16:45.799]  In fact, I would use the word he's becoming unhinged.
[01:16:45.879 --> 01:16:52.824]  And this this started several years ago when he brought the Southern Poverty Law Center here to Spokane, Washington to train sheriff deputies.
[01:16:53.385 --> 01:16:57.688]  I actually sat in on that training to see exactly what they were teaching.
[01:16:57.728 --> 01:16:58.829]  I had my aide with me.
[01:16:58.889 --> 01:17:02.292]  We took very copious notes and he put up on the screen there.
[01:17:02.412 --> 01:17:06.576]  And by the way, this sheriff tries to claim that he didn't know what the training was going to be about.
[01:17:06.696 --> 01:17:10.319]  Yet his picture was in the bottom right hand corner of the slide show.
[01:17:10.979 --> 01:17:14.481]  So, he tries to claim he didn't know, but he knew exactly what was in this training.
[01:17:14.521 --> 01:17:24.765]  And during this training, they put the picture on the screen of the leader of the We The People movement down in Pullman, Washington, Jeff Williams, put it up there, and they said that he was a domestic terrorist, or an example of one.
[01:17:25.626 --> 01:17:28.187]  Guy has never been tried, never been convicted.
[01:17:28.207 --> 01:17:34.630]  In fact, I don't think he's ever even been investigated for that, and yet the Southern Poverty Law Center was demonizing this individual.
[01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:38.672]  Now, it was brought to the Sheriff's attention, and instead of apologizing and saying,
[01:17:39.918 --> 01:17:40.459]  Messed up.
[01:17:40.819 --> 01:17:41.740]  This shouldn't have happened.
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:42.641]  I'm sorry.
[01:17:43.142 --> 01:17:50.209]  It took six months and several meetings of local area constituents and leaders to get that sheriff to send an apology letter to Jeff Williams.
[01:17:50.690 --> 01:17:57.977]  And then years, a couple of years later, when this deputy finally says this out in the open on camera that the MRAPs are for constitutionalists.
[01:17:58.678 --> 01:18:00.839]  This sheriff, again, doesn't apologize.
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.361]  He just tries to say this was taken out of context.
[01:18:04.061 --> 01:18:08.744]  Alex, I don't know in what context that would ever be okay to say something like that.
[01:18:09.244 --> 01:18:17.889]  And myself and many others that believe in freedom and liberty, that believe the Constitution means what it says, we're sick and tired of being demonized.
[01:18:17.969 --> 01:18:22.092]  It's the people that are ignoring the Constitution in this country that are the problem.
[01:18:22.172 --> 01:18:23.633]  It's the people like this sheriff
[01:18:24.636 --> 01:18:32.162]  Who, by the way, has been investigated for assault, for pumping private gas into, or public gas into a private vehicle.
[01:18:32.623 --> 01:18:39.448]  He's said publicly that he wants to stop all lying in his department, and yet there was a murder of a pastor.
[01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:44.873]  A pastor literally on his own property here in Spokane, Washington.
[01:18:45.153 --> 01:18:50.558]  There was a $2 million settlement from that case because it was very clear that pastor was shot.
[01:18:51.298 --> 01:18:51.959]  Unlawfully.
[01:18:52.399 --> 01:18:54.901]  That deputy continued on his department.
[01:18:55.361 --> 01:19:05.709]  And by the way, during the investigation it was uncovered that deputy lied on his employment forms about outside employment, which was a sex toy shop he was running with his wife.
[01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:09.872]  Lied on that and was never fired for it and was only fired this year.
[01:19:10.908 --> 01:19:12.429]  And he was in an unmarked vehicle, right?
[01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.890]  And he was in an unmarked vehicle.
[01:19:41.369 --> 01:19:44.931]  This is just really arrogant and aggressive, and let's pull back.
[01:19:44.951 --> 01:19:46.853]  This is a tiny window
[01:20:03.686 --> 01:20:09.750]  Because most departments are smart enough to either reject the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, or they keep the training secret.
[01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:12.032]  We told everybody the MRAPS is for us.
[01:20:12.392 --> 01:20:17.316]  Now we've got videos of departments all over the country, or their manuals, saying it's for us.
[01:20:17.336 --> 01:20:18.137]  I'm going to repeat this.
[01:20:18.837 --> 01:20:27.844]  Thousands of heavy armored vehicles with 50 cal machine guns, you name it, have been delivered free of charge, or in some cases sold,
[01:20:28.953 --> 01:20:33.836]  To departments for war with veterans and gun owners and conservatives.
[01:20:34.117 --> 01:20:35.017]  This is outrageous.
[01:20:35.517 --> 01:20:36.078]  It's criminal.
[01:20:37.079 --> 01:20:41.782]  It constitutes an attempted soft coup by the Obama administration.
[01:20:42.102 --> 01:20:48.666]  And when people like Representative Shea and others have the will to go in the face of this tyranny, they get demonized.
[01:20:48.706 --> 01:20:50.328]  And let's talk about his demonization of you.
[01:20:50.628 --> 01:20:52.189]  In fact, they gave me the report a few weeks ago.
[01:20:52.209 --> 01:20:56.732]  Somebody reprint that newspaper and bring it to me because it's in a bunch of the newspapers.
[01:20:56.752 --> 01:20:57.793]  This is a big paper there.
[01:20:58.493 --> 01:21:05.037]  You read this stuff, you can't believe they're saying it or implying that we want to kill people or that you want to kill people.
[01:21:05.337 --> 01:21:07.739]  And he says that you're out of control as a state rep.
[01:21:07.999 --> 01:21:11.661]  He's really escalating the rhetoric when we've never said any of this.
[01:21:12.081 --> 01:21:13.602]  What do you think's really behind this?
[01:21:13.662 --> 01:21:17.304]  Because I really see the pieces and it doesn't look good.
[01:21:17.324 --> 01:21:19.946]  Well, I think there's two parts of it, Alex.
[01:21:19.986 --> 01:21:22.608]  The first part is they're trying to bait
[01:21:23.484 --> 01:21:28.907]  Liberty and constitutionalists, liberty movement folks are trying to bait us into doing something.
[01:21:28.947 --> 01:21:29.848]  That's the very first thing.
[01:21:29.888 --> 01:21:31.929]  The second thing is they're trying to come after veterans.
[01:21:32.489 --> 01:21:38.012]  And in particular, this share of supporters tried to denigrate my service record last year.
[01:21:38.032 --> 01:21:43.855]  And I served two combat tours overseas, Alex, in Bosnia and in Iraq, both.
[01:21:44.236 --> 01:21:46.357]  And I got to tell you, I am furious
[01:21:46.977 --> 01:21:59.803]  This sheriff would try to say that I'm some sort of an extremist, I'm some sort of a domestic terrorist, when I sat there and I fought overseas the very people that he should be more concerned about here in this country.
[01:22:00.323 --> 01:22:01.743]  Oh, that's right, I forgot.
[01:22:01.963 --> 01:22:07.266]  The new article from last week, he now compares you to ISIS.
[01:22:07.766 --> 01:22:10.827]  He actually says, like the terrorist in ISIS.
[01:22:11.027 --> 01:22:12.028]  What's going on with that?
[01:22:12.808 --> 01:22:15.489]  Well, he says he compares us to ISIS.
[01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:17.611]  He compares constitutionalists to ISIS.
[01:22:17.631 --> 01:22:20.092]  Then he tried to walk back and say that was taken out of context.
[01:22:20.232 --> 01:22:32.518]  Again, I would say there is never a context in which you say that word in the exact same sentence, that acronym ISIS, in the exact same sentence, that you're implying that constitutionalists are domestic terrorists.
[01:22:32.538 --> 01:22:33.399]  You don't say that.
[01:22:34.079 --> 01:22:44.923]  And that's what's so alarming about the sheriff on top of the video that he did last year, October 20th, 2014, where he says, I can affect your freedom and take your life.
[01:22:45.403 --> 01:22:47.244]  We need to be asking questions of the sheriff.
[01:22:47.264 --> 01:22:48.044]  That's our job.
[01:22:48.124 --> 01:22:53.666]  And this sheriff, instead of blaming victims and blaming other people, should answer for his actions.
[01:22:53.706 --> 01:22:55.607]  And I have publicly asked that he resign.
[01:22:56.067 --> 01:23:00.769]  And Alex, I'm here to ask you today, we need you up here in the InfoWars spotlight on this sheriff.
[01:23:01.249 --> 01:23:04.370]  Because very clearly there is something going on in this area.
[01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:06.891]  In fact, there's kind of a tale of two sheriffs going on.
[01:23:07.331 --> 01:23:13.293]  We had the VA come up Priest River, Idaho and threaten the firearms rights of a veteran here a week and a half ago.
[01:23:13.873 --> 01:23:20.876]  And Sheriff Darrell Wheeler stood in the house with us and said no bureaucrat is going to take away the God-given unalienable rights.
[01:23:22.438 --> 01:23:31.713]  Tell us about this hero sheriff that we should get on the show and interview versus this bizarro sheriff.
[01:23:33.339 --> 01:23:41.243]  Yeah, so Daryl Wheeler said, I think, what every sheriff should be saying, that bureaucrats cannot take away any sort of God-given unalienable right.
[01:23:41.263 --> 01:23:42.823]  There's no judge, there's no jury.
[01:23:42.883 --> 01:23:52.688]  They've even said they're going to use, Obama announced a month ago, the VA model for the FBI now, for regular citizens to just magically take your gun, like a no-fly list.
[01:23:52.988 --> 01:23:55.889]  You don't know how you get on it, they just come take your guns.
[01:23:56.089 --> 01:23:59.111]  Well, yeah, the VA is sending out letters like that to veterans all over the country.
[01:24:00.424 --> 01:24:02.548]  Hey, sorry, uh, we don't think that you're quite stable enough.
[01:24:02.568 --> 01:24:06.616]  You're not able to handle your finances, so the VA is going to come in and seize your weapons.
[01:24:07.108 --> 01:24:22.537]  Now they're announcing all social security recipients that take automatic wire transfers, this is a, the FBI announced this, will be considered financially unable to take care of themselves and basically will now be warned to the state your guns will be taken.
[01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:29.480]  Well it's only going to be a matter of time before Sheriff Ozzie Nesovich brings in Snopes to help solve crimes as well, to help with the SPLC.
[01:24:30.694 --> 01:24:36.792]  Joe, I can't believe that I just said on air that a month ago, because you can pull it up, mainstream news.
[01:24:37.754 --> 01:24:46.462]  That they're now going to have the VA model go after people on Social Security saying that, you know, it's like their neck's broken or something.
[01:24:46.482 --> 01:24:47.322]  They can't have guns.
[01:24:47.342 --> 01:24:48.383]  Well, their neck's not broken.
[01:24:48.904 --> 01:24:54.929]  Just because you have a money transfer and do automatic wire transfer of your check, that that means you can't take care of your finances.
[01:24:55.209 --> 01:25:01.695]  And then the Congress came out in the Washington Times the next day in the Hill newspaper and said, Congress warns Obama not to implement.
[01:25:02.095 --> 01:25:02.796]  That isn't enough.
[01:25:02.876 --> 01:25:03.857]  He's going ahead with it.
[01:25:04.558 --> 01:25:07.210]  Representative Shea, can you believe it's moving this quick?
[01:25:07.251 --> 01:25:08.497]  I mean, this is really bold.
[01:25:09.415 --> 01:25:10.276]  It is very bold.
[01:25:10.296 --> 01:25:17.441]  The last two months have seen just a massive escalation of what is very clearly a movement toward tyranny.
[01:25:17.901 --> 01:25:18.861]  No question about it.
[01:25:18.942 --> 01:25:23.244]  And up there in North Idaho, and this is what's going to happen across the country.
[01:25:23.284 --> 01:25:33.411]  For all your viewers, all your listeners, this is what's going to happen across the country, where they're going to have a doctor say, and they didn't say that he was mentally deficient or mentally incompetent.
[01:25:33.811 --> 01:25:37.034]  They said that he was not competent to handle his VA benefits.
[01:25:37.054 --> 01:25:38.294]  That's what they said about this veteran.
[01:25:39.657 --> 01:25:46.337]  Brady Law that he could no longer own, possess, buy, or sell a firearm.
[01:25:46.974 --> 01:25:48.354]  And it's very interesting.
[01:25:48.474 --> 01:25:53.596]  After we went up there, we stood on the front lawn when the VSO showed up there.
[01:25:53.896 --> 01:26:00.298]  We had the sheriff with us and the VA completely backed down and began running away from this as fast as they possibly could.
[01:26:00.318 --> 01:26:12.061]  The very next business day, so the next Monday, the same doctor who had made that decision and had never followed up over eight months after this gentleman had a stroke to see that he'd actually recovered from the stroke.
[01:26:13.035 --> 01:26:16.758]  wrote a letter and said magically, oh, he's all better now.
[01:26:16.778 --> 01:26:17.919]  He's totally fine.
[01:26:18.859 --> 01:26:21.161]  These are test trial balloons.
[01:26:21.241 --> 01:26:22.101]  They have said it.
[01:26:22.462 --> 01:26:24.423]  They are coming after everybody.
[01:26:24.944 --> 01:26:26.685]  And I'm telling you, if they try to disarm
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:32.706]  Millions of people on social security, it's going to start a civil war, and I think that's their plan.
[01:26:33.066 --> 01:26:35.109]  So how do we not respond?
[01:26:35.209 --> 01:26:36.250]  Well, we don't get violent.
[01:26:36.771 --> 01:26:44.282]  We politically get involved, like this state rep, and go and stand in the doors, draw attention to it, show video of it, and it will backfire.
[01:26:45.529 --> 01:27:09.929]  I think that one of the great examples of this was just a video we posted here over the weekend, again, involving this sheriff's office and a particular deputy Lawhorn, interesting name by the way, where there was a pro-life protester on a corner, completely legal, four ladies come up and begin harassing him, hurling violent and vile insults at him right in his face.
[01:27:10.569 --> 01:27:21.454]  A homeschool mom pulls over and begins filming, and it ends up that this guy, the guy that's protesting, instead of the four ladies, is the one that is put in handcuffs and detained.
[01:27:21.494 --> 01:27:21.734]  Yes.
[01:27:21.834 --> 01:27:24.356]  And treated abysmal, abysmal, abysmal.
[01:27:24.436 --> 01:27:25.736]  In fact, I saw that video.
[01:27:25.756 --> 01:27:26.717]  Give us the name of that.
[01:27:26.757 --> 01:27:28.818]  We'll put it up on screen because this is what we're talking about.
[01:27:29.358 --> 01:27:32.000]  There are more patriots than there are pro-death people.
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:44.851]  The woman pulls over to document, then she's able to catch this sheriff's deputy following the Southern Poverty Law Center Soviet Roundup plan to, oh, I've got one of these pro-lifers, let's take him to jail.
[01:27:45.192 --> 01:27:51.257]  Because they hate the fact that last weekend, or the weekend before last, there were thousands of demonstrations across the country.
[01:27:51.597 --> 01:27:53.579]  Some of them 500, some of them one person.
[01:27:53.899 --> 01:27:55.681]  Some of them 1,000, some of them 20 people.
[01:27:56.061 --> 01:28:02.847]  But every person going out did something by drawing out the tyranny, by showing what these evil forces want to do.
[01:28:02.867 --> 01:28:06.810]  I mean, if that doesn't show how wicked this sheriff is, nothing does.
[01:28:06.850 --> 01:28:07.210]  There it is.
[01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:13.536]  Spokane Sheriff's Deputy harasses peaceful pro-life protester, threatens witnesses on video.
[01:28:13.996 --> 01:28:23.925]  This is what it is to have a hardcore communist organization, that's what the Southern Poverty Law Center is, just hardcore evil running our sheriffs and police departments.
[01:28:24.226 --> 01:28:25.167]  I mean, this is sick.
[01:28:25.367 --> 01:28:26.148]  Representative Shea?
[01:28:26.768 --> 01:28:31.853]  And the perfect example of how to act in this situation is what this whole homeschool mother did.
[01:28:32.293 --> 01:28:38.880]  She remained calm, she remained very respectful, and she demanded that they state the reason she could not be there.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:42.382]  And this is despite the fact that I want to read this for you, Alex.
[01:28:42.422 --> 01:28:48.086]  It's despite the fact that in the sheriff's own standards of conduct, it reads this.
[01:28:48.546 --> 01:28:56.071]  The Spokane Sheriff's Office recognizes the right of persons to lawfully record members of this department who are performing their official duties.
[01:28:56.471 --> 01:29:01.315]  Members of this department will not prohibit or intentionally interfere with such lawful recordings.
[01:29:01.595 --> 01:29:04.797]  They're not even abiding by their own standards, their own clear standards.
[01:29:05.177 --> 01:29:08.800]  And this homeschool mom did a phenomenal job by remaining calm
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:18.083]  Standing on her God-given unalienable rights protected by the Constitution and demanding that that deputy state the reason why she couldn't be there, and he didn't have an answer.
[01:29:18.263 --> 01:29:19.243]  I'll tell you what's exciting.
[01:29:19.263 --> 01:29:21.604]  I want to get Joe Biggs' take on this when we come back and the state reps.
[01:29:22.264 --> 01:29:24.665]  You can feel the good people standing up in your gut.
[01:29:25.125 --> 01:29:28.626]  And they're so much stronger, so much more focused than these evil people.
[01:29:29.006 --> 01:29:30.006]  And evil knows it.
[01:29:30.326 --> 01:29:31.567]  That's why from Rutgers
[01:29:32.287 --> 01:29:37.751]  To the University of Texas, they're trying to restrict free speech because they know they gotta shut us up.
[01:29:38.092 --> 01:29:42.655]  When we come back, we're gonna fight back with the Second Amendment with Joe Biggs, Representative Matt Shea.
[01:29:43.015 --> 01:29:44.517]  VoteShea.com.
[01:29:44.877 --> 01:29:48.720]  And this sheriff's trying to organize movements to have Shea removed from office.
[01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:49.560]  We'll be back.
[01:29:51.022 --> 01:29:51.922]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.403 --> 01:29:54.004]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.945 --> 01:29:57.627]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.785 --> 01:30:02.507]  Kill whites and cops.
[01:30:02.968 --> 01:30:07.533]  Black Lives Matter affiliated radio show calls for a race war.
[01:30:07.793 --> 01:30:17.004]  In a disgusting audio broadcast via blog talk radio yesterday, an individual who admitted affiliation with the Black Lives Matter movement
[01:30:17.344 --> 01:30:24.169]  Called for listeners to murder white people and police, declaring it open season for executions.
[01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:27.632]  Open season on killing white and white police officers.
[01:30:28.092 --> 01:30:32.616]  And I want to talk about the shooting of the white deputy sheriff in Houston, Texas.
[01:30:32.656 --> 01:30:36.038]  It's open season on killing white and white police officers.
[01:30:36.679 --> 01:30:38.240]  And probably killing cops, period.
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:39.381]  It's open season.
[01:30:40.001 --> 01:30:43.162]  For updates on this story and breaking news as it happens, go to InfoWars.com.
[01:31:00.703 --> 01:31:04.507]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[01:31:04.807 --> 01:31:15.116]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[01:31:15.256 --> 01:31:18.179]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[01:31:18.319 --> 01:31:27.081]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[01:31:27.121 --> 01:31:28.882]  This is the good halogen.
[01:31:28.982 --> 01:31:31.722]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.

[01:33:13.447 --> 01:33:15.328]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.489 --> 01:33:26.274]  You know, I'm gonna move Vani Hari, the food babe, who's launching another major initiative and having huge success, to next week.
[01:33:27.234 --> 01:33:29.036]  Because what she's doing is very important.
[01:33:29.116 --> 01:33:30.437]  We've got major GMO news.
[01:33:31.217 --> 01:33:34.380]  Where Germany's basically banning everything from the U.S., Russia is.
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:37.662]  Because it's so polluted, it's so dangerous.
[01:33:38.223 --> 01:33:38.823]  And that's good.
[01:33:38.863 --> 01:33:42.626]  It'll stop Big Agra from doing what they're doing.
[01:33:43.527 --> 01:33:44.488]  Voting with our dollars.
[01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.549]  Here it is.
[01:33:46.569 --> 01:33:49.912]  Germany joins Scotland in seeking ban on gene-modified seeds.
[01:33:50.913 --> 01:33:52.054]  So that's all coming up.
[01:33:53.049 --> 01:34:03.454]  We have Joel Cilenta in the last 30 minutes, but I want to be able to get into this Planned Parenthood situation, the Chinese stocks, what's happening in Europe, where I see all this going.
[01:34:03.834 --> 01:34:09.637]  I want to get into this clip where comedian jabs Hillary Clinton for attending Bilderberg.
[01:34:10.297 --> 01:34:11.478]  On national TV.
[01:34:11.758 --> 01:34:20.041]  This is very exciting what's happening, but I need to talk to Representative Shea and Joe Biggs for the rest of the hour to really be able to flesh all this out.
[01:34:20.081 --> 01:34:21.862]  And I appreciate them joining us.
[01:34:21.882 --> 01:34:26.884]  We're going to go back to them in a moment because I tend to start talking real fast.
[01:34:26.984 --> 01:34:27.925]  I start sweating.
[01:34:28.925 --> 01:34:30.066]  I start getting angry.
[01:34:30.886 --> 01:34:32.527]  Not because there's something wrong with me.
[01:34:33.911 --> 01:34:38.976]  If I was a German in 1938 Germany, believe me, I'd be upset about what I saw.
[01:34:39.556 --> 01:34:50.446]  Military equipment being deployed locally, people being demonized for their free speech, restrictions on gathering if you weren't in the right group, kids being told their parents weren't their bosses.
[01:34:51.967 --> 01:34:53.528]  Classic totalitarianism.
[01:34:54.109 --> 01:34:54.890]  And I gotta say,
[01:34:56.263 --> 01:34:59.510]  Hitler's tyranny early on was focused mainly on select groups.
[01:34:59.570 --> 01:35:00.412]  It wasn't general.
[01:35:01.073 --> 01:35:03.318]  The general level of bizarreness...
[01:35:04.178 --> 01:35:13.405]  With public schools all over the country banning touching hands, banning dodgeball, banning boy and girl, restricting free speech.
[01:35:13.505 --> 01:35:17.068]  Schools all across the country are, quote, banning all flags.
[01:35:17.749 --> 01:35:19.410]  See, all flags are hurtful now.
[01:35:19.890 --> 01:35:20.951]  All language is hurtful.
[01:35:21.211 --> 01:35:25.295]  That's the goal, where they can ban and restrict anything they want, when they want.
[01:35:25.595 --> 01:35:27.416]  They're the arbiters who decide.
[01:35:28.898 --> 01:35:30.159]  These people are such tyrants.
[01:35:31.403 --> 01:35:32.444]  That I get upset.
[01:35:32.464 --> 01:35:55.801]  I mean, when they're deploying armored vehicles in every town, and then police and military have told us for 18 years, since I learned about this, from police and military, the chief of police of San Antonio, the head of emergency management in Kingsville, I have them on video saying Bill Clinton had Delta Force approach them about preparing martial law and gun confiscation.
[01:35:56.382 --> 01:35:58.664]  And by exposing that, they had to back off.
[01:35:59.397 --> 01:36:05.439]  They were thinking about pulling off more Oklahoma City's folks and blaming the Liberty Movement, but we exposed them, we backed them off.
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:19.324]  Now they're back, and it's like 10 times worse than it was, and they're openly saying, and we have another clip from Indiana, we're going to play in a moment, saying, this is for the American people.
[01:36:20.475 --> 01:36:21.756]  This is for the veterans.
[01:36:21.816 --> 01:36:23.457]  They're going to attack us.
[01:36:24.157 --> 01:36:37.006]  That's a Morgan County, Indiana police sergeant saying the same words that we know came out of the mouth of the sheriff's deputy in Spokane because it's Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:36:38.103 --> 01:36:42.247]  And in their public documents, they say I'm evil and horrible and, you know, all this stuff.
[01:36:42.267 --> 01:36:44.769]  But in their internal ones, they say I'm a terrorist.
[01:36:44.829 --> 01:36:45.610]  We know that's come out.
[01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:50.574]  They were saying about locals that run mainline Tea Party groups that this is a terrorist.
[01:36:50.894 --> 01:36:57.100]  And imagine the sheriff's deputies are all sitting there in a room, hundreds of them, learning in a major city, a major town,
[01:36:58.322 --> 01:37:00.904]  That this guy is a terrorist.
[01:37:01.745 --> 01:37:04.868]  So they see a woman out with her First Amendment, she's a terrorist.
[01:37:04.888 --> 01:37:11.553]  I'm going to give the floor to Joe Biggs and Shea for the rest of this segment and the last segment of this hour, but I've laid that out.
[01:37:11.573 --> 01:37:13.295]  We're going to play this clip briefly.
[01:37:13.335 --> 01:37:18.279]  I want to just remind viewers, it is essential that you spread the word about this broadcast.
[01:37:18.619 --> 01:37:20.421]  There is a reason they're attacking it.
[01:37:20.701 --> 01:37:22.583]  There is a reason they're demonizing it.
[01:37:23.083 --> 01:37:25.826]  Because we're here raising the alarm like Paul Revere.
[01:37:26.906 --> 01:37:30.388]  The exact same office Paul Revere had, we are in that position today.
[01:37:30.649 --> 01:37:31.529]  So is Matt Shea.
[01:37:31.909 --> 01:37:34.731]  So is people like Joe Biggs.
[01:37:34.911 --> 01:37:38.474]  So are you, like that woman out there with the pro-life sign.
[01:37:39.673 --> 01:37:41.474]  They want to intimidate us not to do that.
[01:37:41.514 --> 01:37:42.754]  That's why they tell us not to.
[01:37:42.774 --> 01:37:44.875]  Now most departments would support it because they're good people.
[01:37:45.035 --> 01:37:51.437]  We have to expose the bad people that are globalist collaborators by engaging them peacefully.
[01:37:52.118 --> 01:37:54.939]  They want to get it violent because we're winning the info war.
[01:37:54.999 --> 01:37:57.660]  No, we've got hidden cameras inside your Planned Parenthood.
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.721]  We have hidden cameras inside your state houses.
[01:37:59.961 --> 01:38:00.901]  We're coming for you.
[01:38:01.081 --> 01:38:02.222]  We're stronger than you.
[01:38:02.762 --> 01:38:03.702]  There's more of us.
[01:38:04.242 --> 01:38:05.083]  We're awake now.
[01:38:05.203 --> 01:38:05.863]  We're coming.
[01:38:06.303 --> 01:38:06.923]  We're coming.
[01:38:07.143 --> 01:38:08.544]  Go ahead and act however you want.
[01:38:08.784 --> 01:38:09.664]  We're coming for you.
[01:38:10.004 --> 01:38:11.064]  I'm glad you're scared.
[01:38:11.304 --> 01:38:11.865]  We're coming.
[01:38:12.545 --> 01:38:13.065]  Go ahead.
[01:38:13.345 --> 01:38:14.645]  Engage in some terrorism.
[01:38:14.705 --> 01:38:15.146]  Blame us.
[01:38:15.906 --> 01:38:16.626]  This isn't 95.
[01:38:16.966 --> 01:38:18.086]  You're not going to get away with it.
[01:38:18.707 --> 01:38:19.387]  You didn't get away with 95.
[01:38:20.247 --> 01:38:22.028]  Most people know that was an inside job now.
[01:38:22.408 --> 01:38:22.848]  Go ahead.
[01:38:22.968 --> 01:38:23.888]  Try to pull it.
[01:38:24.328 --> 01:38:26.289]  Because it's going to blow up in your face, literally.
[01:38:26.669 --> 01:38:29.530]  Before we go any further, we have the best colloidal silver out there.
[01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:30.470]  Bar none.
[01:38:30.490 --> 01:38:32.531]  30 parts per million.
[01:38:32.591 --> 01:38:33.451]  Highest quality.
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:39.908]  I am not going to sell out of it this time because we're not going to get more until mid-October at least, maybe November.
[01:38:40.809 --> 01:38:45.838]  So I'm going to try to hold back enough so at regular sales price, we'll have enough to get us there.
[01:38:46.707 --> 01:38:51.610]  So I've done a calculation of selling it, how many we can sell until we need to stop the sale.
[01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:54.812]  Thursday or Friday, we'll have to end it, guaranteed.
[01:38:55.413 --> 01:39:01.657]  Buy two bottles at regular price, get two bottles free, or get 30% off the regular discounted price.
[01:39:02.477 --> 01:39:03.618]  It's an amazing deal.
[01:39:04.058 --> 01:39:05.800]  Colloidal Silver is so amazing.
[01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:06.840]  A lot of people know about it.
[01:39:07.181 --> 01:39:08.681]  Read about it at infowarslife.com.
[01:39:10.151 --> 01:39:12.373]  Continuing, Supermail Vitality.
[01:39:13.073 --> 01:39:16.817]  After being sold out for weeks, Supermail Vitality is back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:39:17.137 --> 01:39:19.659]  We're now taking orders on this new emergency shipment.
[01:39:20.039 --> 01:39:22.121]  Our biggest shipment ever and the strongest.
[01:39:22.701 --> 01:39:27.746]  It has hundreds of five-star reviews on Power Reviews, third-party review site, highly respected.
[01:39:28.006 --> 01:39:30.308]  We link to it at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:39:30.748 --> 01:39:32.990]  Here are just some of the latest reviews.
[01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:34.011]  This is by
[01:39:35.518 --> 01:39:37.340]  Okay, that's Miami, Florida.
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:38.460]  Thank you for the review.
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.842]  Thank you for your support.
[01:40:05.825 --> 01:40:10.167]  Initially didn't experience much in the way of results, so I held off writing a review.
[01:40:11.087 --> 01:40:16.390]  Then a little over a week ago, I began to notice some dramatic changes in how I felt and even in my mental state.
[01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:17.530]  This stuff is the real deal.
[01:40:18.190 --> 01:40:19.171]  And it varies the dose.
[01:40:19.851 --> 01:40:25.874]  I withheld a star because I want to see the long-term effects when things normalize within my body.
[01:40:26.194 --> 01:40:30.836]  But I would, and do recommend this to my friends, absolutely worth giving this a shot.
[01:40:30.876 --> 01:40:30.996]  Yeah.
[01:40:31.556 --> 01:40:33.357]  What it does is block estrogen mimickers.
[01:40:33.417 --> 01:40:35.077]  It gets your glands to start releasing.
[01:40:35.397 --> 01:40:37.898]  It doesn't mimic a testosterone.
[01:40:38.259 --> 01:40:41.220]  It gets your body to release a whole bunch of stuff according to group.
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:42.400]  I don't know the technicals.
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:42.900]  Read about it.
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:44.841]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:40:45.561 --> 01:40:47.962]  And it helps fund the operation, so it's a win-win.
[01:40:48.362 --> 01:40:48.542]  All right.
[01:40:48.723 --> 01:40:51.584]  I'm now going to try to settle down and shut up after this clip.
[01:40:52.044 --> 01:40:54.405]  Here is, again, what we mentioned, the sheriff's deputy.
[01:41:04.668 --> 01:41:09.649]  We really didn't have the violence that we see today.
[01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:15.350]  The weaponry is totally different now than it was in the beginning of my career.
[01:41:16.111 --> 01:41:24.233]  Plus, you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[01:41:25.185 --> 01:41:28.226]  All right, Joe Biggs, you've been sitting back listening to all this.
[01:41:28.266 --> 01:41:30.908]  I want you to take a few minutes to break all this down.
[01:41:30.948 --> 01:41:32.788]  I mean, veterans, very low crime rate.
[01:41:32.928 --> 01:41:34.449]  Conservatives, one of the lowest crime rates.
[01:41:34.749 --> 01:41:42.553]  There isn't an escalation in patriots engaging in criminal activity or terrorism, but they're trying to prepare us for when they false flag, in my view.
[01:41:42.573 --> 01:41:42.853]  Go ahead.
[01:41:43.473 --> 01:41:49.554]  I mean, just like that guy said, these guys are coming out of the military and they're automatically able to make these IEDs, which is complete and total BS.
[01:41:49.934 --> 01:42:10.298]  It'll only be a small portion of the people who actually train with explosive ordnance disposal or anything like that, or just some random stuff that you can figure out on the internet yourself, but they make it seem like you come back from Iraq and Afghanistan and you have this capability to go out and build these complex bombs and go blow stuff up, when in actuality, when you go over there, you learn how to restrain yourself, you learn how to use
[01:42:13.194 --> 01:42:22.879]  Just different types of how you carry your weapon, where you point your muzzle, the safety with it, how you talk to people, how you approach, how you can de-escalate situations easier.
[01:42:23.339 --> 01:42:29.982]  My ability to de-escalate a situation is much easier than it is for a normal civilian who hasn't quite been through what I've been through.
[01:42:30.362 --> 01:42:37.205]  So when you see these sheriffs come out here and they say that we're just taking time bombs, that's kind of just out of control right there.
[01:42:37.225 --> 01:42:38.266]  I mean, that's way out there.
[01:42:39.093 --> 01:42:44.156]  Well, there are some that are ticking time bombs, but statistically, veterans have lower crime rates than any other major group.
[01:42:44.236 --> 01:42:45.437]  It's just a load of crap!
[01:42:45.477 --> 01:42:51.201]  The ones that are ticking time bombs are the ones that have been through a crazy scenario, such as like a lone survival thing.
[01:42:51.541 --> 01:42:53.423]  They bring them back and they pump them full of medications.
[01:42:53.443 --> 01:42:54.443]  They don't get to the root of the problem.
[01:42:54.703 --> 01:42:56.004]  They pump them full of medications.
[01:42:56.605 --> 01:42:58.446]  Or they had something wrong with them before they went.
[01:42:58.686 --> 01:43:00.768]  Yeah, but that's what they need to do.
[01:43:00.788 --> 01:43:01.809]  They need to get to the root of the problem.
[01:43:01.829 --> 01:43:06.473]  Stop demonizing an entire group of patriots who decided to get up off their butt and go fight for their country.
[01:43:07.033 --> 01:43:10.156]  Well, they're getting ready to get rid of humans in combat and have all machines.
[01:43:10.477 --> 01:43:12.658]  And the last group that we have to deal with is going to be the veterans.
[01:43:12.779 --> 01:43:15.281]  So there will be a major war on veterans worldwide.
[01:43:15.301 --> 01:43:16.282]  There's a war on men.
[01:43:16.642 --> 01:43:17.903]  There's a war on standing up.
[01:43:18.283 --> 01:43:20.605]  You know, Obama acts like he loves these soldiers.
[01:43:21.466 --> 01:43:22.787]  Uh, that stood up on the train.
[01:43:22.807 --> 01:43:23.688]  They're all these heroes.
[01:43:23.908 --> 01:43:25.189]  That's exactly who they hate.
[01:43:25.389 --> 01:43:27.871]  But they're using the mainstream media right now to dumb everybody down.
[01:43:27.911 --> 01:43:31.213]  I go all over the country and I meet people, engage in conversations.
[01:43:31.233 --> 01:43:33.454]  A lot of people don't even know they have the right to carry weapons.
[01:43:33.915 --> 01:43:39.579]  They don't even know that they could carry an assault rifle or a shotgun or what they even need to do to... Sure.
[01:43:39.879 --> 01:43:40.720]  ...to have a concealed weapon.
[01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:41.800]  What do you think of this sheriff?
[01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:42.661]  What do you think he's doing?
[01:43:44.026 --> 01:43:45.126]  I think he's just spewing rhetoric.
[01:43:45.147 --> 01:43:46.347]  I think he's out of control.
[01:43:46.407 --> 01:43:49.528]  I think this guy is a puppet for the SPLC.
[01:43:49.588 --> 01:43:53.530]  He's doing whatever he can to demonize the Patriot movement in Spokane.
[01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:56.411]  Like you said before, that's a great town full of great people.
[01:43:56.711 --> 01:44:08.995]  Everyone I met over there, good head on their shoulders, freedom-loving, liberty-loving Americans who want to do the right thing, and they don't want to live in a government that's going to try to take their land or pull them over in unmarked cars.
[01:44:09.015 --> 01:44:10.516]  They don't want to have to worry about stuff like that.
[01:44:10.536 --> 01:44:11.136]  They want to be
[01:44:12.237 --> 01:44:18.450]  And now he's on the cover of the newspaper, standing on the people, standing on the county.
[01:44:19.692 --> 01:44:20.753]  I mean, it's bizarre.
[01:44:20.773 --> 01:44:22.614]  They clearly are trying to get somebody to do something.
[01:44:22.794 --> 01:44:23.354]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:23.374 --> 01:44:29.137]  And then I said, I'm coming out there to talk to the sheriff, and he starts tweeting, good, it's about time.
[01:44:29.177 --> 01:44:31.258]  And I'm like, man, this guy really, something's wrong with him.
[01:44:31.278 --> 01:44:41.204]  Yeah, and I told him, I said, hey, make sure you don't go on vacation this time, because last time we went out there, we showed up, went to the police department, and the guy was all of a sudden on this unexpected vacation that his apartment said had been planned for a while.
[01:44:41.524 --> 01:44:43.765]  But meanwhile, he'd been spotted all over town while we were there.
[01:44:43.805 --> 01:44:44.866]  He was just ducking and dodging us.
[01:44:45.785 --> 01:44:48.226]  So we'll see if he actually stands up this time and comes out and talks.
[01:44:48.866 --> 01:44:55.768]  Well, we'd love to find out he was just wrong, but... Alright, I'm going to shut up now and go to Representative Matt Shea, VoteShea.com.
[01:44:56.228 --> 01:45:01.589]  I notice in the news articles they're saying, these are horrible state reps that are with these extremists, we need to vote them out.
[01:45:01.909 --> 01:45:13.032]  And that's what the whole headline of the article says, that Spokane Republican Sheriff says members of his own party are dangerously dividing people when he's the one doing it.
[01:45:13.833 --> 01:45:14.913]  Continue to break this down.
[01:45:16.334 --> 01:45:18.115]  So, there are a couple points here.
[01:45:18.175 --> 01:45:24.117]  First, I would like to also add that Sheriff Richard Mack challenged this sheriff to a debate.
[01:45:24.517 --> 01:45:33.841]  And this sheriff promised that at the beginning of the summer he was going to have a debate with him, and it's been eight months later and he has still not followed up to debate Sheriff Richard Mack.
[01:45:33.861 --> 01:45:41.124]  So, it's just a continued pattern of behavior by this guy to say one thing and then do something completely different.
[01:45:41.644 --> 01:45:52.637]  The other point that I would like to make as far as this is concerned, what we're really talking about when we talk about Planned Parenthood, we talk about this veteran that was being threatened, at least his firearms rights were being threatened up there in Priest River, Idaho.
[01:45:53.017 --> 01:45:55.500]  They want us to self-censor.
[01:45:55.860 --> 01:46:02.248]  They're trying to make the environment so toxic out there that we just self-censor, and that is the worst kind of tyranny.
[01:46:02.768 --> 01:46:06.131]  And that's what really I think ultimately they are trying to do.
[01:46:06.511 --> 01:46:11.255]  This sheriff is directly related to FEMA and boy he's acting like it.
[01:46:11.295 --> 01:46:13.817]  Many of his statements are, oh the government's doing a great job.
[01:46:14.217 --> 01:46:27.868]  Tell that to the people up in north central Washington right now where we had the Forest Service refuse to put a fire out when it was only an acre and it grew to thousands of acres and has destroyed dozens of cattle up there on one ranch in particular.
[01:46:28.308 --> 01:46:35.453]  So, really there's this disconnect, I think, between these people that are defending the bureaucracy and the rest of America.
[01:46:35.493 --> 01:46:56.548]  This sheriff says we need to vote these representatives out of office, and yet, because I stand on principle, because I expose this stuff, and these other legislators that work with me over in Olympia expose this stuff, and we fight it, and we stand on that line, that's what the people want, and we keep getting re-elected by huge numbers no matter how much money they throw against us.
[01:46:57.308 --> 01:47:08.896]  That's right, you and others I was reading, you've had the Bloomberg anti-gun money coming into the state against you, you've got the Southern Poverty Law Center sneaking around, you've got the media demonizing you, but all that does is make you more popular.
[01:47:09.256 --> 01:47:10.877]  What do you think that tells the sheriff?
[01:47:11.988 --> 01:47:14.871]  Well, I think it scares the sheriff, and that's what's making him so nervous.
[01:47:14.891 --> 01:47:18.174]  That's what's making him become unhinged like he is right now.
[01:47:18.754 --> 01:47:22.338]  And when government is fearing the people, that's actually a good thing.
[01:47:22.838 --> 01:47:23.719]  It is a good thing.
[01:47:23.959 --> 01:47:25.000]  That's what freedom is.
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.802]  That's what freedom looks like.
[01:47:27.342 --> 01:47:28.403]  And I don't know...
[01:47:29.504 --> 01:47:35.710]  You know, going to someplace over on the west side of downtown Seattle, if they're going to feel the same way I do about this.
[01:47:35.730 --> 01:47:39.734]  But many people in rural Washington and in eastern Washington do feel this way.
[01:47:40.134 --> 01:47:44.338]  That bureaucrats are literally becoming little petty tyrants.
[01:47:44.878 --> 01:47:47.080]  And that we're really experiencing bureaucratic terrorism.
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:50.683]  And people are sick and tired of being guilty until proven innocent.
[01:47:51.004 --> 01:47:54.127]  And the way that this sheriff's been acting, especially toward constitutionalists,
[01:47:54.767 --> 01:47:59.228]  And especially calling them out on several occasions is clearly fostering that feeling.
[01:47:59.608 --> 01:48:13.092]  And one recent incident, and this has not been widely reported on, there was a gentleman who is very well versed on his constitutional obligations and his God-given unalienable rights protected by the Constitution.
[01:48:13.573 --> 01:48:17.514]  And he stood, just like this homeschool mother did in this Planned Parenthood video, and said,
[01:48:18.374 --> 01:48:20.855]  Tell me why you are questioning us.
[01:48:21.015 --> 01:48:21.855]  Are we free to leave?
[01:48:21.995 --> 01:48:22.955]  Are we being detained?
[01:48:23.396 --> 01:48:24.776]  Well, he ended up getting arrested.
[01:48:24.816 --> 01:48:25.996]  He gets taken downtown.
[01:48:26.376 --> 01:48:27.537]  He's sitting there getting booked.
[01:48:27.597 --> 01:48:31.978]  And one of the first things that's said to him is, you're one of those constitutionalists, aren't you?
[01:48:32.878 --> 01:48:36.519]  And that's the attitude that is pervasive throughout this department.
[01:48:36.539 --> 01:48:41.921]  They try to say these things are taken out of context when in reality, this is exactly what they're being trained on.
[01:48:43.126 --> 01:48:49.149]  It's incredibly creepy to see them doing this, and it's all because of Agenda 21.
[01:48:49.229 --> 01:48:51.430]  It's all the new zoning, all the new regulations.
[01:48:51.930 --> 01:49:01.055]  It's preparing the police and the military for this tyrannical agenda, and the agenda's admitted.
[01:49:01.934 --> 01:49:06.439]  It's in the news, they just don't want us speaking out against it because the agenda is so unpopular.
[01:49:07.060 --> 01:49:11.405]  I see the people across the political spectrum really starting to awaken.
[01:49:12.026 --> 01:49:17.573]  Representative Shea, what would you say the sense is of your constituents about what's happening?
[01:49:18.929 --> 01:49:29.539]  The sense is exactly what you're saying, that something is drastically wrong in this country, that we are headed in the exact wrong direction, that tyranny is dramatically increasing, especially over the last two months.
[01:49:30.239 --> 01:49:36.085]  People before that said, oh, that would never happen in America are now saying, oh, my goodness, you were right.
[01:49:36.225 --> 01:49:37.246]  Infowars was right.
[01:49:37.386 --> 01:49:38.106]  What do I do?
[01:49:38.467 --> 01:49:41.469]  So there is a great awakening happening right now.
[01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:43.091]  And just that one
[01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:48.285]  Incident up there in Priest River where the VA was threatening the firearms rights of that veteran.
[01:49:48.985 --> 01:49:54.431]  On one post, we had 760 Facebook shares literally went viral in a matter of hours.
[01:49:54.771 --> 01:50:02.679]  And I think that is a testimony to the fact that people are waking up and not only waking up, they're ready to get engaged and stand on the line and say enough, no more.
[01:50:03.379 --> 01:50:04.360]  You've gone too far.
[01:50:04.701 --> 01:50:07.604]  You need to back up and get back in your constitutionally designed box.
[01:50:08.615 --> 01:50:08.955]  That's right.
[01:50:08.975 --> 01:50:10.316]  They're always trying to intimidate us.
[01:50:10.336 --> 01:50:11.516]  They're always trying to shut us up.
[01:50:11.536 --> 01:50:13.137]  They're always trying to make us think we don't have power.
[01:50:13.657 --> 01:50:16.738]  But there's a time in history when people finally go across the line.
[01:50:17.358 --> 01:50:20.519]  They don't care what the enemy says or what's done or what's in front of them.
[01:50:20.779 --> 01:50:22.600]  They're going to find a way to expose it.
[01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:23.740]  They're engaged.
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:24.420]  They're motivated.
[01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:25.421]  Nothing's going to stop them.
[01:50:25.641 --> 01:50:27.582]  And I can feel that energy rising.
[01:50:27.982 --> 01:50:31.443]  I had dread just a few months ago seeing all this corruption expand.
[01:50:31.883 --> 01:50:33.924]  But now I can see it and also feel it.
[01:50:34.264 --> 01:50:37.165]  Just like in a football game, you feel the momentum change when you're in the stands.
[01:50:37.546 --> 01:50:40.607]  I can feel the spirit of liberty exploding.
[01:50:40.867 --> 01:50:41.587]  Can you feel it, Joe?
[01:50:41.907 --> 01:50:42.328]  Of course.
[01:50:43.108 --> 01:50:44.208]  Everywhere I go, I can feel it.
[01:50:44.829 --> 01:50:48.510]  You see it when you talk to people, when people engage in conversation with you.
[01:50:48.530 --> 01:50:51.992]  You can tell that there's a great awakening happening and we're going to start winning.
[01:50:52.012 --> 01:50:52.752]  And they're not afraid.
[01:50:53.292 --> 01:50:56.394]  They know that they just got to get up off their butts, start speaking out.
[01:50:57.034 --> 01:50:59.235]  And they don't care win or lose, they're not going to shut up.
[01:50:59.535 --> 01:51:01.096]  Final segment with our special guest.
[01:51:02.179 --> 01:51:06.100]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:09.061]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:09.221 --> 01:51:10.542]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:10.782 --> 01:51:13.723]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:14.003 --> 01:51:14.923]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:51:15.463 --> 01:51:15.724]  Just.
[01:51:15.884 --> 01:51:16.144]  Won't.
[01:51:16.324 --> 01:51:16.544]  Quit.
[01:51:32.281 --> 01:51:33.061]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:51:33.081 --> 01:51:34.581]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:34.901 --> 01:51:36.182]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:36.542 --> 01:51:38.882]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:39.362 --> 01:51:41.223]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:41.663 --> 01:51:45.703]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:51:46.163 --> 01:51:49.864]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[01:54:12.116 --> 01:54:16.599]  Representative Matt Shea from Washington State will be with us with Joe Biggs, five minutes to the next hour.
[01:54:16.619 --> 01:54:19.781]  Then we're going to get into the abortion situation and so much more.
[01:54:19.841 --> 01:54:28.348]  But this new video put together that illustrates reality and fiction together, how Red Dawn is beginning to parallel what America is
[01:54:29.198 --> 01:54:29.978]  Becoming like.
[01:54:30.578 --> 01:54:32.339]  It's like a Red Dawn in slow motion.
[01:54:33.259 --> 01:54:37.321]  Darren McBreen and, of course, Rob Dood put this together last week.
[01:54:37.341 --> 01:54:40.862]  I thought I'd play it now and then get the representative's take on it.
[01:54:41.122 --> 01:54:43.883]  If you're a radio listener, it's even more powerful as video.
[01:54:44.263 --> 01:54:47.924]  So go to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:54:47.944 --> 01:54:55.147]  We're also going to post the video itself to YouTube today and post it to InfoWars.com in the next hour.
[01:54:55.427 --> 01:54:57.768]  But here is that Red Dawn parallel.
[01:55:06.131 --> 01:55:10.512]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[01:55:11.132 --> 01:55:14.733]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[01:55:15.133 --> 01:55:16.734]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:55:17.214 --> 01:55:18.854]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:55:19.414 --> 01:55:21.095]  John has a long mustache.
[01:55:21.415 --> 01:55:23.055]  John has a long mustache.
[01:55:23.455 --> 01:55:26.176]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[01:55:26.476 --> 01:55:30.417]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[01:55:36.326 --> 01:55:37.747]  But they took a lot of people away.
[01:55:38.208 --> 01:55:40.090]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[01:55:40.330 --> 01:55:42.952]  People that had guns or things they wanted, they just took them away.
[01:55:43.553 --> 01:55:43.833]  Where?
[01:55:44.914 --> 01:55:46.796]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[01:55:47.016 --> 01:55:54.944]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:55:55.344 --> 01:55:59.148]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[01:56:01.715 --> 01:56:05.660]  We need the type of camps that you all run.
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:06.181]  I mean, really.
[01:56:06.481 --> 01:56:09.385]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[01:56:09.845 --> 01:56:14.832]  Now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[01:56:14.932 --> 01:56:16.814]  I'm a sorry citizen.
[01:56:16.875 --> 01:56:18.597]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[01:56:18.917 --> 01:56:20.658]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[01:56:20.698 --> 01:56:21.719]  would you see that happening?
[01:56:21.779 --> 01:56:26.463]  I mean we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[01:56:26.563 --> 01:56:34.689]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[01:56:36.351 --> 01:56:42.195]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[01:56:42.355 --> 01:56:46.899]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community
[01:56:53.683 --> 01:56:56.004]  That's what we're doing here and let's not kid about it.
[01:56:56.225 --> 01:57:00.267]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[01:57:01.288 --> 01:57:02.328]  Put your gun down, really?
[01:57:04.469 --> 01:57:08.892]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:57:09.472 --> 01:57:11.013]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:57:11.293 --> 01:57:15.436]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[01:57:16.416 --> 01:57:20.339]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:57:30.521 --> 01:57:34.026]  See, that's my response is, oh my God, like a foreign enemy's attacking.
[01:57:34.547 --> 01:57:35.849]  I see the manuals, the training.
[01:57:35.869 --> 01:57:40.796]  We got them first from secret sources, as everybody knows, seven years ago, and they're preparing for war with us.
[01:57:41.857 --> 01:57:43.699]  Representative Shea, we've got a few minutes to break.
[01:57:43.719 --> 01:57:44.880]  We're going to come back and finish up.
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:46.982]  But, I mean, isn't that the key to this?
[01:57:47.062 --> 01:57:54.348]  That they don't want to have a debate about the treasonous, traitorous preparations that are being made, that our own military doesn't want to follow?
[01:57:54.769 --> 01:58:03.857]  And that's really what's backfired, is the military is so awake now because they're trying to train them to take on their grandfather and their father, who are a veteran.
[01:58:04.157 --> 01:58:05.479]  I mean, this has really backfired.
[01:58:05.499 --> 01:58:06.460]  Can you speak to that briefly?
[01:58:07.213 --> 01:58:07.713]  Absolutely.
[01:58:07.753 --> 01:58:10.534]  The Oath Keepers in the military are alive and well.
[01:58:10.574 --> 01:58:12.855]  The spirit of 76 is alive and well.
[01:58:13.455 --> 01:58:16.876]  And I would just comment on the one part of the video.
[01:58:17.476 --> 01:58:19.737]  We're disloyal to tyrants.
[01:58:19.837 --> 01:58:21.838]  We're disloyal to tyranny.
[01:58:22.714 --> 01:58:24.215]  We are loyal to America.
[01:58:24.235 --> 01:58:25.796]  We're loyal to the Constitution.
[01:58:26.136 --> 01:58:28.377]  And we believe the Constitution means what it says.
[01:58:28.817 --> 01:58:36.681]  And what they try to do is deflect, obfuscate, debagle, get people pointed in every direction except what they're actually doing.
[01:58:36.701 --> 01:58:40.063]  Exactly, because they are literally collaborators that have taken over the country.
[01:58:40.103 --> 01:58:42.064]  I mean, they are an occupation force.
[01:58:42.084 --> 01:58:43.164]  That's not rhetoric, folks.
[01:58:43.204 --> 01:58:45.405]  They're trying to ban the word boy and girl.
[01:58:45.465 --> 01:58:46.126]  Back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:51.658 --> 01:58:54.880]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:59:03.184]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:59:03.424 --> 01:59:08.447]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:59:08.847 --> 01:59:11.128]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:59:11.368 --> 01:59:13.169]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:59:22.677 --> 01:59:24.777]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.

[01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:31.520]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:33.061]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:59:33.161 --> 01:59:36.383]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:59:36.643 --> 01:59:38.463]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:59:38.624 --> 01:59:39.524]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:59:39.544 --> 01:59:40.504]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:59:40.744 --> 01:59:42.605]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[01:59:54.233 --> 01:59:57.055]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:07.342 --> 02:00:08.002]  Big Brother.
[02:00:08.663 --> 02:00:09.703]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:10.424 --> 02:00:11.545]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:12.185 --> 02:00:13.006]  You want answers?
[02:00:13.766 --> 02:00:14.667]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:15.327 --> 02:00:18.950]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:23.573]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.180 --> 02:00:34.508]  King James Version.
[02:00:34.528 --> 02:00:35.469]  1 John 5.19.20.
[02:00:39.913 --> 02:00:45.298]  We know that we are of God and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
[02:00:46.704 --> 02:00:53.349]  And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so we may know Him who is true.
[02:00:53.369 --> 02:00:56.030]  See, you gotta be able to judge who's good and who's bad in the world.
[02:00:56.511 --> 02:00:58.732]  And we are in Him who is true.
[02:01:00.053 --> 02:01:04.616]  In His Son, Jesus Christ, this is the true God and eternal life.
[02:01:05.717 --> 02:01:12.422]  Again, and we know that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
[02:01:15.351 --> 02:01:20.455]  Undoubtedly, ladies and gentlemen, we are now in the power of the evil one.
[02:01:21.716 --> 02:01:29.101]  And the decision's been made, the death race has begun, the trigger's being pulled, and this is the big test.
[02:01:29.141 --> 02:01:31.363]  Everybody thinks you're just gonna lay down and it's gonna leave you alone.
[02:01:31.383 --> 02:01:33.645]  No, that's what the wolves go after first.
[02:01:35.325 --> 02:01:37.687]  And just great judgment is coming upon this country.
[02:01:37.747 --> 02:01:38.788]  So much evil is going on.
[02:01:39.088 --> 02:01:41.731]  The three minutes we have left are going to be on for an hour next week at least.
[02:01:42.291 --> 02:01:43.992]  Breaking more of this down, stevequell.com.
[02:01:44.313 --> 02:01:45.974]  Tell me about your new film coming out.
[02:01:46.455 --> 02:01:49.057]  Tell me about the book that accompanies it at stevequell.com.
[02:01:50.051 --> 02:01:56.254]  Well, interesting Alex, Technology of the Fallen delayed due to the discovery of historical documents.
[02:01:56.294 --> 02:02:01.957]  You can go to, your listener can go to TrueLegendTheSeries.com.
[02:02:02.437 --> 02:02:10.661]  We found, when Tim Alvarino went to South America, this is critical, we found documents that have not been seen by anybody
[02:02:11.441 --> 02:02:19.044]  For 450 years talking about the supernatural nature of the sexual perversion of the Giants.
[02:02:19.404 --> 02:02:29.007]  People that don't believe this, you know, I can't do anything about your unbelief, but even Diodorus, famous historian, kind of an author, 400, you know, 500 years before Jesus.
[02:02:29.067 --> 02:02:29.927]  Bottom line is, Alex, the
[02:02:35.649 --> 02:02:43.474]  The subject matter of supernatural evil, and you just laid it out, the Bohemian Grove and all these people, you know, they're being promised now something.
[02:02:43.734 --> 02:02:48.257]  They're being promised the same lie that Eve was told in the Garden of Eden.
[02:02:48.577 --> 02:02:50.298]  Ye shall not surely die.
[02:02:50.418 --> 02:02:52.640]  Sure, well that's the Nephilim.
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:56.482]  Look at the movie Prometheus where it's giants as well.
[02:02:56.522 --> 02:02:57.763]  They're just throwing it in our face.
[02:02:58.519 --> 02:03:05.801]  Well listen, my new book, and this is really important, Genesis 6 Giants first came out, I think, 10-15 years ago.
[02:03:06.822 --> 02:03:08.122]  The whole thing has been redone.
[02:03:08.142 --> 02:03:09.683]  60-70% of it's new.
[02:03:10.063 --> 02:03:18.845]  But what's fascinating, True Legends the series, it's almost like we were given a time lock into the ancient past to validate and verify.
[02:03:19.166 --> 02:03:20.406]  Even stories that the
[02:03:20.506 --> 02:03:21.307]  We're good to go.
[02:03:44.005 --> 02:03:44.405]  I think?
[02:04:14.746 --> 02:04:22.834]  How is it that the Pope is pushing for a one-rule government, he's speaking against capitalism, and yet in the same breath he's saying he believes in the devil and demons?
[02:04:23.454 --> 02:04:25.176]  You know why he made that statement?
[02:04:25.577 --> 02:04:30.001]  Guess who are going to be made out to be the devil and demons?
[02:04:30.461 --> 02:04:32.724]  Anybody who resists the New World Order.
[02:04:32.984 --> 02:04:34.986]  Again, TrueLegendsOfSeries.com.
[02:04:35.266 --> 02:04:37.609]  My book, Genesis of Six Giants, is available.
[02:04:38.449 --> 02:04:45.977]  On my website, stevequayle.com, and from the response I'm getting from all over the world, people are saying thank you.
[02:04:46.238 --> 02:04:47.539]  Now... Oh, I'm gonna watch it.
[02:04:47.619 --> 02:04:48.740]  I'm gonna watch it with my children.
[02:04:49.641 --> 02:04:50.322]  Very interesting.
[02:04:50.362 --> 02:04:51.343]  Steve Quayle, thank you.
[02:04:51.363 --> 02:04:52.584]  We'll talk to you again next week.
[02:04:52.945 --> 02:04:53.685]  Steve Quayle.
[02:04:54.066 --> 02:04:54.366]  You bet.
[02:04:54.406 --> 02:04:56.308]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:04:56.368 --> 02:05:00.493]  Coming up, the breaking news about the Recruiting Center situation, the evacuation.
[02:05:01.531 --> 02:05:06.032]  Liberals call for disarming all white men after theater shooting.
[02:05:06.312 --> 02:05:08.392]  Article up at Infowars.com.
[02:05:08.612 --> 02:05:20.614]  Liberals on theater rushed to exploit the Lafayette theater shooting before the bodies were even cold, demanding that all white men be stripped of their Second Amendment rights in response to this tragedy.
[02:05:20.794 --> 02:05:25.115]  Now some of the tweets were, mass shooters are always lone white males.
[02:05:25.315 --> 02:05:28.236]  Solution, prohibit gun sales to lone white men.
[02:05:28.476 --> 02:05:29.996]  Compromise on gun control.
[02:05:30.256 --> 02:05:33.720]  Everyone can have as many guns as they want, except for white guys.
[02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:34.962]  Hashtag Lafayette.
[02:05:35.102 --> 02:05:35.743]  Another tweet.
[02:05:35.883 --> 02:05:39.287]  White men just shouldn't be allowed to own guns.
[02:05:39.528 --> 02:05:40.929]  Hashtag Lafayette.
[02:05:41.070 --> 02:05:42.251]  Hashtag Lafayette.
[02:05:42.451 --> 02:05:43.453]  Guns aren't the problem.
[02:05:43.813 --> 02:05:45.255]  White men are the problem.
[02:05:45.555 --> 02:05:47.096]  Our country has a terrorist problem.
[02:05:47.336 --> 02:05:50.219]  A white, male, American terrorist problem.
[02:05:50.339 --> 02:05:51.260]  Hashtag Lafayette.
[02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:52.240]  Hashtag Aurora.
[02:05:52.540 --> 02:05:53.181]  Guess what?
[02:05:53.341 --> 02:05:54.862]  Hashtag grow up.
[02:05:55.082 --> 02:05:58.185]  Hold people accountable for their individual actions.
[02:05:58.545 --> 02:06:00.407]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com
[02:06:01.107 --> 02:06:20.671]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the Nightly News, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[02:06:20.851 --> 02:06:25.252]  Well then, about six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:06:25.592 --> 02:06:26.172]  I think.
[02:06:47.864 --> 02:06:49.545]  You can pick it up at a local sporting goods store.
[02:06:49.725 --> 02:06:53.868]  Whatever you do, get your Head Down firearm today.

[02:07:59.124 --> 02:08:06.805]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:26.613 --> 02:08:28.634]  And there was a wind on down the road.
[02:08:29.234 --> 02:08:31.115]  Our shadows were taller than our souls.
[02:08:37.658 --> 02:08:39.038]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:08:39.058 --> 02:08:39.378]  to 2 p.m.
[02:08:39.398 --> 02:08:40.459]  Central, we're here live.
[02:08:41.319 --> 02:08:42.780]  Back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:08:44.833 --> 02:08:45.794]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:08:45.834 --> 02:08:52.401]  Jim Maher is an old friend of mine, the first guy to teach a college-level course in the JFK assassination, the crime beat reporter.
[02:08:53.042 --> 02:08:59.449]  Back when, basically when JFK got killed for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, he looks a lot younger than he actually is.
[02:08:59.629 --> 02:09:01.872]  He's everybody's favorite historian.
[02:09:02.452 --> 02:09:03.352]  I don't know, man.
[02:09:03.432 --> 02:09:05.353]  You are a living legend.
[02:09:05.373 --> 02:09:07.294]  But I guess you've been involved since you were really, really young.
[02:09:07.314 --> 02:09:10.595]  You even went to the same nightclub that Jack Ruby would hang out in.
[02:09:11.016 --> 02:09:18.899]  And you've had a whole bunch of New York Times, you know, top ten bestsellers, TV shows made out of what you've done, the movie JFK based on your book.
[02:09:19.813 --> 02:09:21.014]  Worked on that with Oliver Stone.
[02:09:21.294 --> 02:09:22.334]  Just an amazing guy.
[02:09:22.354 --> 02:09:22.915]  Good friend of mine.
[02:09:22.935 --> 02:09:23.315]  Good to see you.
[02:09:23.335 --> 02:09:25.016]  You're going to be speaking at Brave New Books.
[02:09:25.696 --> 02:09:28.858]  Population Control is one of your most important books, and I've read most of them.
[02:09:29.258 --> 02:09:30.979]  How Corporate Owners Are Killing Us.
[02:09:31.039 --> 02:09:36.303]  Jim Mars, best-selling author of Rule by Secrecy and the Trillion Dollar Conspiracy.
[02:09:36.983 --> 02:09:39.204]  And he joins us to break this down.
[02:09:39.604 --> 02:09:41.966]  But first, I want to go to this report and get his take on it.
[02:09:42.666 --> 02:09:45.368]  Tampa recruiting offices evacuated due to threat
[02:09:46.661 --> 02:09:49.682]  Unspecified shooting threat comes one week after Chattanooga shooting.
[02:09:50.102 --> 02:09:57.985]  Joe Biggs and Josh Owen shot the video of smugglers at 60 yards away bringing in masses of drugs basically during Trump's visit to the border.
[02:09:58.485 --> 02:10:00.526]  That was on Drudge and made national news last night.
[02:10:01.006 --> 02:10:01.867]  Now Joe
[02:10:03.311 --> 02:10:04.552]  He's talking to the recruiting offices.
[02:10:04.592 --> 02:10:05.512]  Got them to go on record.
[02:10:05.812 --> 02:10:08.033]  They've evacuated all the Tampa facilities.
[02:10:08.353 --> 02:10:09.394]  Won't let them be armed.
[02:10:09.654 --> 02:10:11.474]  Won't let citizens come stand out front.
[02:10:12.135 --> 02:10:13.095]  And now this has happened.
[02:10:13.135 --> 02:10:13.976]  Here's Joe Biggs.
[02:10:14.296 --> 02:10:16.777]  Report with the text, the tweets, all the evidence.
[02:10:17.197 --> 02:10:19.078]  Redlinked at Infowars.com.
[02:10:19.118 --> 02:10:19.458]  Here it is.
[02:10:20.982 --> 02:10:22.943]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[02:10:22.963 --> 02:10:31.805]  Now about 40 minutes ago I got a tweet from a friend who lives in Georgia whose son lives down in Florida and roommates with a recruiter.
[02:10:32.465 --> 02:10:41.187]  Now this recruiter says that they have been ordered to evacuate all the recruiting stations in the Tampa area due to a threat.
[02:10:42.105 --> 02:10:51.352]  Now, I talked about this earlier in the week when I was standing guard in front of the recruiter's office in South Park Meadows in the south part of Austin.
[02:10:51.693 --> 02:10:58.158]  One of the recruiters from one of the departments came out and said that they were getting threats in Las Vegas and in Florida.
[02:10:58.738 --> 02:11:04.143]  Now it looks like they have taken it to another level with a direct threat in Tampa Bay.
[02:11:04.543 --> 02:11:06.985]  So these guys have evacuated.
[02:11:07.025 --> 02:11:10.007]  And I know this because I personally have called numerous locations
[02:11:10.888 --> 02:11:13.531]  In the Tampa area and gotten zero answers.
[02:11:13.571 --> 02:11:17.434]  The phone just rings and or goes to a voice recording.
[02:11:17.875 --> 02:11:19.276]  So this is happening right now.
[02:11:19.296 --> 02:11:20.517]  We're going to keep our eyes on it.
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:23.081]  Stay alert if you're in the Tampa area.
[02:11:23.302 --> 02:11:31.768]  If you have the ability to swing by one of these places and see if they are indeed open or if they are vacant, give us a tip on the video below.
[02:11:31.988 --> 02:11:33.950]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[02:11:51.303 --> 02:12:00.521]  The Old Dinosaur Media, and here you are, with a leg in each world, Population Control, How Corporate Owners Are Killing Us, available at Amazon.com and bookstores everywhere.
[02:12:00.861 --> 02:12:02.184]  Mr. Mars, good to have you here with us.
[02:12:02.898 --> 02:12:06.982]  Let me tell you what the greatest irony is on this gun thing, okay?
[02:12:07.022 --> 02:12:15.189]  Here we've got trained military people who've been trained on firearms, but they won't let them go armed to protect themselves.
[02:12:15.649 --> 02:12:26.939]  But the greatest irony is that you'll find in my new book, Population Control, that the United States of America, over the past couple of decades, is the arms merchant of the world.
[02:12:27.279 --> 02:12:39.166]  We provide 78%, according to congressional records, of all the arms sold to everybody around the world, including, of course, the ISIS and al-Qaeda and all the rest of it.
[02:12:39.346 --> 02:12:43.509]  And half the global expenditure is just on us.
[02:12:43.789 --> 02:12:50.651]  Yes, so we provide 78% of all arms to people in the world, and then we look at Russia and China.
[02:12:50.851 --> 02:12:52.992]  Russia's 5%, China's 3%.
[02:12:54.092 --> 02:13:02.334]  So we sell more arms than Russia and China combined all around the world, and yet here in our own country, they want to take guns away from everybody.
[02:13:02.354 --> 02:13:03.715]  That's amazing.
[02:13:03.735 --> 02:13:04.635]  Aren't you a veteran yourself?
[02:13:04.935 --> 02:13:06.955]  Yes, I was in the army during Vietnam.
[02:13:07.456 --> 02:13:08.336]  What do you make?
[02:13:09.808 --> 02:13:17.311]  of the situation where we now know they've put 200 plus thousand veterans on don't treat list and just say go die.
[02:13:17.611 --> 02:13:19.551]  We've known for a year and they just keep doing it.
[02:13:19.591 --> 02:13:25.714]  It seems like, I thought if we exposed evil, a lot of times it would get turned around back in your day or even when I was on there 20 years ago.
[02:13:26.094 --> 02:13:32.516]  Now the evil comes out, the IRS persecutes people a thousand times, times Nixon literally, and don't get in trouble.
[02:13:32.816 --> 02:13:34.937]  Well, hey, come on, look at it, Alex.
[02:13:35.917 --> 02:13:38.578]  Veterans are the most dangerous group to them.
[02:13:38.778 --> 02:13:45.701]  Because not only are veterans patriotic, but veterans have weapons and know how to use them.
[02:13:47.645 --> 02:13:48.305]  Common sense.
[02:13:48.505 --> 02:13:49.106]  You brought it up.
[02:13:49.126 --> 02:13:49.986]  I don't want to bring up a story.
[02:13:50.106 --> 02:13:50.346]  I'm in.
[02:13:50.407 --> 02:13:51.367]  It just shows the insanity.
[02:13:51.387 --> 02:13:52.728]  We can put it on screen if they have it.
[02:13:53.248 --> 02:14:00.632]  Yesterday, I remember it was two days ago, Salon, that basically takes White House talking points and regurgitates them, came out and said that the Planned Parenthood videos are hoax.
[02:14:01.052 --> 02:14:02.133]  Planned Parenthood admits it's real.
[02:14:02.953 --> 02:14:04.274]  And that I'm basically the bad guy.
[02:14:04.314 --> 02:14:05.735]  That Margaret Sanger was not a racist.
[02:14:05.755 --> 02:14:06.115]  There it is.
[02:14:06.495 --> 02:14:08.716]  Conspiracy theorists have hijacked the GOP.
[02:14:09.037 --> 02:14:12.879]  What happens when Trump, Cruz, and Carson start following Alex Jones' lead?
[02:14:12.899 --> 02:14:16.641]  And it goes, the Planned Parenthood hoax is a case study.
[02:14:17.518 --> 02:14:19.379]  And how we're deceptive.
[02:14:19.739 --> 02:14:21.260]  They admit this!
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:22.340]  It's not a hoax.
[02:14:22.801 --> 02:14:39.369]  You know, well, we're into when Nostradamus, the famous 16th century seer, said that we're going to go in a time period when black is white and white is black, up is down, down is up, and believe me, that's where we are, right?
[02:14:40.109 --> 02:14:40.949]  Peace is war?
[02:14:41.450 --> 02:14:46.492]  Well, you've actually written a book that a lot of it was about Margaret Sanger and the Nazi influence in the U.S.
[02:14:46.672 --> 02:14:46.852]  Right.
[02:14:46.972 --> 02:14:49.093]  And you even have some slides in there, some of it's in this book.
[02:14:49.393 --> 02:14:52.154]  Tell us about Margaret Sanger since they say she was a loving person.
[02:14:52.354 --> 02:14:52.715]  Well, yeah.
[02:14:52.795 --> 02:14:53.835]  And I'm the racist.
[02:14:53.915 --> 02:14:58.337]  You have to go back and understand about the eugenicist movement, okay?
[02:14:58.457 --> 02:15:04.800]  Eugenics came up in the late 1800s and it was basically started right here in the United States, in fact, in California.
[02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:11.965]  And was supported by some of the wealthiest, biggest-named people in the country, the Harrimans, the Melons, the Rockefellers.
[02:15:12.405 --> 02:15:17.850]  And eugenics is basically, let's have the perfect race.
[02:15:17.930 --> 02:15:28.838]  You know, if you had the wrong skin color or the wrong bone structure or your IQ wasn't up to their standards, by the 1930s, most every state had sterilization laws.
[02:15:29.278 --> 02:15:29.659]  I don't know.
[02:15:49.438 --> 02:15:56.304]  And we had World War II, and we had the Holocaust, and the people in the world went, wait a minute, you know, we can't just go around killing people.
[02:15:56.725 --> 02:16:08.395]  So today, if you'll talk to these globalists, they're all still very much eugenicists, and they will say flat out, in fact, they have it etched in stone in Georgia, at the Georgia Guidestones.
[02:16:08.415 --> 02:16:08.936]  Ted Turner.
[02:16:09.256 --> 02:16:12.719]  He says, we want to maintain the human population at 500 million.
[02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:15.481]  That's a 90 plus percent reduction.
[02:16:15.682 --> 02:16:20.385]  Right, which begs the question, well wait a minute, what's supposed to happen to the other 7 billion of us?
[02:16:20.726 --> 02:16:24.469]  And more importantly, who's going to decide who stays and who goes?
[02:16:24.809 --> 02:16:26.330]  And how are they going to get rid of us?
[02:16:26.691 --> 02:16:32.595]  Well, the Nazis show that they'll run into trouble if they try to just shoot people and hang them and kill them.
[02:16:33.096 --> 02:16:36.699]  So what they're doing is, they are slowly thinning the human herd.
[02:16:37.199 --> 02:16:42.322]  Through bad food, bad air, bad water, bad vaccines.
[02:16:42.822 --> 02:16:51.568]  Do you know the third leading cause of death in America today after heart attacks and cancer is conventional medical treatment?
[02:16:51.708 --> 02:16:52.348]  I didn't know that.
[02:16:53.329 --> 02:16:54.149]  I want to get into your book.
[02:16:54.189 --> 02:17:06.397]  It's simply amazing and it's solution-based to understand what to avoid and is along the line that I'm focusing on exposing the breakaway civilization is poisoning us so that they can basically just phase us out.
[02:17:08.054 --> 02:17:08.916]  And profit from it.
[02:17:09.156 --> 02:17:10.098]  And profit while they do it.
[02:17:10.138 --> 02:17:11.300]  That's the genius of these people.
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:12.522]  They're not dumb.
[02:17:12.642 --> 02:17:13.504]  And there's kind of an argument.
[02:17:13.544 --> 02:17:14.886]  If we put up with it, maybe we deserve it.
[02:17:14.906 --> 02:17:17.330]  But I wanted to ask you a selfish question because I grew up...
[02:17:18.544 --> 02:17:23.006]  Hearing how great Texas was and how we were the smartest, the toughest, the most honorable, blah, blah, blah.
[02:17:23.247 --> 02:17:24.907]  Lord knows a lot of bad comes out of Texas, too.
[02:17:24.947 --> 02:17:31.531]  But now that I've studied history, traveled the world, I do know that Texas is certainly exceptional.
[02:17:31.891 --> 02:17:40.196]  The military has always tried to recruit as much as it can out of Texas, saying they found in combat and operations, Texas on average, you know, make the best soldiers.
[02:17:41.056 --> 02:17:48.679]  And then it's, I notice it's Texans so much that are resisting the New World Order, but it was Texans that also killed Kennedy, who also do really nasty stuff.
[02:17:48.699 --> 02:17:55.401]  So, dark side and light side, Texas seems to be a real crossroads, and now Texas is opposing so much of the New World Order.
[02:17:56.001 --> 02:17:57.822]  You're a classic Texan, go way back.
[02:17:58.242 --> 02:18:01.283]  You're a Texas, you know, just standard great Texas guy.
[02:18:01.763 --> 02:18:03.284]  What do you think about Texas before we go to break?
[02:18:03.984 --> 02:18:05.304]  Well, Texas is it.
[02:18:06.285 --> 02:18:07.105]  I'm like you, Alex.
[02:18:07.165 --> 02:18:08.085]  I've traveled the world.
[02:18:08.145 --> 02:18:09.145]  I've been to Tibet.
[02:18:09.565 --> 02:18:10.565]  I've been to the Middle East.
[02:18:10.946 --> 02:18:11.806]  I've been to Europe.
[02:18:11.966 --> 02:18:13.126]  I've been to Canada.
[02:18:13.146 --> 02:18:13.926]  I've been all over.
[02:18:14.006 --> 02:18:15.646]  And there's some prettier places.
[02:18:15.706 --> 02:18:17.667]  There's some very picturesque places.
[02:18:17.747 --> 02:18:22.508]  But I've never found a place in the world that I think measures up to Texas.
[02:18:23.008 --> 02:18:24.448]  Texas, we've got it all.
[02:18:24.868 --> 02:18:26.609]  And we've got beaches.
[02:18:26.669 --> 02:18:27.509]  We've got mountains.
[02:18:27.589 --> 02:18:28.469]  We've got forests.
[02:18:28.509 --> 02:18:29.229]  We've got plains.
[02:18:29.289 --> 02:18:30.329]  We've got... But the people, too.
[02:18:30.349 --> 02:18:32.490]  Because if you go back to Texas history... And we have people.
[02:18:33.050 --> 02:18:33.390]  Yes.
[02:18:33.770 --> 02:18:39.474]  And you go back to the people who broke away from Mexico, and I'm not talking about the white settlers.
[02:18:39.554 --> 02:18:43.036]  I'm talking about Juan Seguin and the Hispanic people that lived here.
[02:18:43.456 --> 02:18:48.499]  And I don't know, at least in my life growing up in Texas, everybody got along.
[02:18:48.739 --> 02:18:49.440]  Everything's good.
[02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:53.262]  And you mentioned some of the bad stuff, like Kennedy, okay?
[02:18:54.482 --> 02:18:55.823]  Let me tell you something.
[02:18:55.943 --> 02:19:00.346]  Some of those people involved in some of the bad stuff were not even truly Texans.
[02:19:00.766 --> 02:19:07.850]  One of the things that's really griped me for years is the fact that the Bush family, they say, well, they're Texas oil men.
[02:19:07.870 --> 02:19:08.670]  No, no, no.
[02:19:08.730 --> 02:19:10.191]  They came from Connecticut.
[02:19:10.211 --> 02:19:12.152]  They're just Yankee carpetbaggers.
[02:19:12.692 --> 02:19:13.372]  And you're right.
[02:19:13.453 --> 02:19:17.975]  Texas has always had a military history that we should be proud of.
[02:19:18.615 --> 02:19:27.520]  I know during the late great war between the states, Robert E. Lee, one of the most famous generals in the world, he said, when the going gets tough, I call on my Texans.
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:35.965]  And unfortunately, you know, today we've all gotten fat and soft and easy, but I think it's time to buckle down and pay attention.
[02:19:36.005 --> 02:19:38.927]  Well, I mean, just look how much Texas has given the globalist resistance.
[02:19:39.187 --> 02:19:39.387]  Yeah.
[02:19:39.568 --> 02:19:43.370]  And then look at how the feds are cutting off the funding, everything that comes from our money anyways.
[02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:46.772]  But we're creating a gold bullion repository.
[02:19:46.932 --> 02:19:49.214]  Texas just took its gold back, I'm telling you.
[02:19:49.254 --> 02:19:50.555]  Texas is special.
[02:19:50.595 --> 02:19:54.157]  We're taking a few steps now and we need to keep going.
[02:19:54.638 --> 02:19:56.039]  All right, let's get into your book when we come back.
[02:19:56.099 --> 02:19:56.759]  It's good to see you.
[02:19:56.799 --> 02:19:57.680]  Tom Flies, brother.
[02:19:58.400 --> 02:19:59.060]  Too much time.
[02:19:59.100 --> 02:19:59.680]  You're awesome.

[02:22:00.919 --> 02:22:05.242]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[02:22:05.362 --> 02:22:10.085]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[02:22:10.225 --> 02:22:14.088]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease.
[02:22:14.268 --> 02:22:17.690]  And a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[02:22:17.910 --> 02:22:20.472]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[02:22:20.572 --> 02:22:25.015]  I've taken whey protein products for years, and I've never noticed results I have with your product.
[02:22:25.055 --> 02:22:28.037]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life.
[02:22:28.237 --> 02:22:32.160]  Within a few days of taking One World Whey, I noticed a dramatic change.
[02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:36.283]  Also, in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[02:22:36.483 --> 02:22:39.866]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar, and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[02:22:40.606 --> 02:22:41.946]  I've been doing this for the past week or so.
[02:22:41.966 --> 02:22:44.007]  I'm not feeling bad anymore and the foot pain is gone.
[02:22:44.187 --> 02:22:48.388]  I'm just finishing up a five pound top I ordered and just got off the phone ordering more.
[02:22:48.548 --> 02:22:49.448]  I love your product.

[02:23:59.244 --> 02:24:07.832]  Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
[02:24:07.912 --> 02:24:08.693]  Nothing.
[02:24:08.833 --> 02:24:12.776]  I mean nothing, honey, if it ain't free.
[02:24:12.937 --> 02:24:13.097]  Yep.
[02:24:13.417 --> 02:24:15.399]  Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.
[02:24:17.828 --> 02:24:19.629]  Jim Mars is our guest in the next segment.
[02:24:19.669 --> 02:24:26.290]  I'm going to ask him what the globalist endgame is and does he agree that he's got a weird feeling like everybody else does and that things are coming to a head.
[02:24:26.750 --> 02:24:27.931]  But I haven't read your book yet.
[02:24:27.971 --> 02:24:28.771]  I've scanned over it.
[02:24:28.911 --> 02:24:30.351]  It looks like a page-turner.
[02:24:30.411 --> 02:24:34.572]  I'm going to read it on the airplane over to Spain next week.
[02:24:34.612 --> 02:24:38.213]  But population control, how corporate owners are killing us.
[02:24:38.673 --> 02:24:40.273]  Jim Mars, best-selling author.
[02:24:40.533 --> 02:24:42.434]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:24:43.314 --> 02:24:48.359]  What do you want to tackle first about the premeditated plan to kill us and make money off doing it?
[02:24:48.679 --> 02:24:56.146]  Well, I think the key thing here is you've got to understand, and I use quotes from many people and I've charted their activities.
[02:24:56.186 --> 02:24:59.049]  We've got a short segment here, so I'll just put it in a nutshell.
[02:24:59.169 --> 02:24:59.529]  Take your time.
[02:24:59.549 --> 02:25:00.170]  We can go to the next.
[02:25:00.490 --> 02:25:07.217]  This ties into everything issue that you deal with Alex and all the people who follow you.
[02:25:07.798 --> 02:25:09.659]  This has gone beyond politics.
[02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:13.283]  This has gone beyond philosophy or debate.
[02:25:14.124 --> 02:25:15.425]  This is self-defense.
[02:25:15.866 --> 02:25:17.527]  These people want you dead.
[02:25:18.388 --> 02:25:19.769]  And, uh, they're working at it.
[02:25:20.450 --> 02:25:33.960]  And, uh, if you care anything about the safety and well-being of your family, your loved ones, you better read my book, you better study, you better listen to Alex, and you better find out what they're doing to you so that you can have a countermeasure.
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:36.862]  So you've researched it deeply, and that's, I mean, they're just open.
[02:25:36.902 --> 02:25:42.747]  It's like Bayer knowingly putting HIV for 10 years in hemophiliac's blood product, and then it came out, they knew it and liked it!
[02:25:42.967 --> 02:25:49.492]  Well, let me quote from Prince Philip, a leading globalist, okay, the head of the Windsors over there in England.
[02:25:49.572 --> 02:25:58.479]  He says, if I'm reincarnated, I would like to come back as a deadly virus to help solve the overpopulation problem.
[02:25:58.860 --> 02:25:59.240]  That's right.
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:00.721]  In other words, he wants to kill us.
[02:26:01.442 --> 02:26:02.623]  Now, how about he goes first?
[02:26:03.730 --> 02:26:04.991]  Yeah, that's what I say.
[02:26:06.091 --> 02:26:07.412]  Let him take the first step.
[02:26:07.472 --> 02:26:09.553]  But here's the whole thing.
[02:26:09.573 --> 02:26:11.514]  It's all based on a phony premise.
[02:26:12.054 --> 02:26:22.378]  All these globalists, Bill Gates, you know, Warren Buffett, you listen to any of them, they'll tell you that the overriding problem in the world today is overpopulation.
[02:26:22.718 --> 02:26:24.079]  Too many people, okay?
[02:26:24.399 --> 02:26:29.882]  Now if you live in a big city and you have to put up with the noise, the traffic, the pollution, it's pretty easy to fall into that.
[02:26:29.902 --> 02:26:32.863]  Yeah, there's just too many people using up all the resources.
[02:26:33.343 --> 02:26:42.905]  But, if you look at it coolly and logically, and let's look right now today in Hong Kong, the average living space is 1,700 square feet.
[02:26:43.265 --> 02:26:47.586]  Hey, if you had an apartment 1,700 square feet, that's pretty decent size.
[02:26:47.606 --> 02:26:49.767]  It's bigger than most of the apartments I lived in.
[02:26:50.467 --> 02:27:00.049]  And based on 1,700 square feet, the entire 7.5 billion population of the world could live comfortably enough just in the state of Texas.
[02:27:00.629 --> 02:27:02.230]  That's true, and I've seen those statistics.
[02:27:03.783 --> 02:27:05.525]  The West is dying and has a problem.
[02:27:05.545 --> 02:27:07.927]  We're having 1.3 children on average for two adults.
[02:27:08.488 --> 02:27:12.532]  You gotta have 2.1 to even replace and take care of the folks, or economies collapse.
[02:27:12.632 --> 02:27:13.152]  We know this.
[02:27:13.833 --> 02:27:23.523]  The third world is growing fast, they have dirty technologies, it is causing some problems, but they're suppressing, as you know, you've written books on it, a lot of advanced technologies that would have taken us out of this.
[02:27:23.823 --> 02:27:24.043]  Right.
[02:27:24.564 --> 02:27:31.569]  None the least of which would be to pursue and move on into space, as we heard about when we were kids.
[02:27:31.649 --> 02:27:32.710]  Plus, humans need a goal.
[02:27:33.090 --> 02:27:39.655]  We'll go to the moon, we're going to mine minerals, it'll pay for the space problem, and we'll go have colonies on Mars, and we'll keep going.
[02:27:39.675 --> 02:27:42.457]  But then you'd have to be a fan of humanity and not write us off.
[02:27:43.357 --> 02:27:43.858]  That's right.
[02:27:44.138 --> 02:27:49.202]  And it's hard enough to control this world, much less if you go into others.
[02:27:50.393 --> 02:27:51.594]  You wanted to get into glyphosate.
[02:27:52.414 --> 02:27:53.854]  I said, what's the most important thing in your book?
[02:27:53.874 --> 02:27:54.855]  And you said glyphosate.
[02:27:55.815 --> 02:28:02.898]  Glyphosate, even the World Health Organization now has admitted that glyphosate is a carcinogenic.
[02:28:02.938 --> 02:28:04.039]  It can cause cancer.
[02:28:04.539 --> 02:28:12.462]  But what I'd like to point out is that they've showed that the rise of glyphosate use, which is the major ingredient of Roundup,
[02:28:12.882 --> 02:28:33.109]  Which is the Monsanto herbicide, which they are putting now on all of our important food crops, soy, corn, wheat, and you can draw a parallel rise between the rise of the use of glyphosate and the rise of autism in children, which has just gone out of hand.
[02:28:33.129 --> 02:28:33.949]  That's shocking!
[02:28:34.469 --> 02:28:36.130]  I'm no chemist, but...
[02:28:36.730 --> 02:28:43.874]  You mean lots of weed poison, hundreds of billions of tons being used a year, 400 billion tons a year now being used in every water table?
[02:28:44.775 --> 02:28:45.015]  Weed?
[02:28:45.535 --> 02:28:47.116]  Weed killer might not be good for our brains?
[02:28:47.337 --> 02:28:49.198]  Well, gee, poison?
[02:28:49.618 --> 02:28:52.700]  Whoa, that's a conspiracy theory out there!
[02:28:52.740 --> 02:29:04.347]  But now, I tell you, you want something shocking, Dr. Stephanie Sinnott, a MIT research scientist who says that there is a definite link between glyphosate and autism.
[02:29:04.367 --> 02:29:05.748]  Definite link that crap stinks, yeah.
[02:29:05.868 --> 02:29:15.817]  Yeah, she says that by 2025, that's just 10 years from now, she said at current rates, every other child will be autistic.
[02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:19.502]  Well, I think that's a good... I mean, thank you, New World Order.
[02:29:19.722 --> 02:29:25.627]  Yeah, well, and from their standpoint, that's pretty good, because, hey, it'd be easy... By the way, that's only ten years away!
[02:29:26.067 --> 02:29:26.428]  I know.
[02:29:26.868 --> 02:29:29.110]  And then half the new kids will be retarded.
[02:29:29.530 --> 02:29:29.690]  Yep.
[02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:32.332]  And they're like, oh, don't use the word retarded, but it's okay to kill them.
[02:29:32.673 --> 02:29:34.794]  It's okay to brain damage them, just use the politically correct term.
[02:29:34.954 --> 02:29:35.835]  Okay, let me be correct.
[02:29:36.175 --> 02:29:38.417]  They're going to be seriously mentally disabled.
[02:29:39.118 --> 02:29:39.338]  Right.
[02:29:39.378 --> 02:29:44.202]  Now can we talk about... But it's okay, I mean... It's okay, because they'll vote Democrat.
[02:29:46.211 --> 02:29:48.013]  Oh boy, here's something else.
[02:29:48.053 --> 02:29:49.114]  Jim Mars is our guest.
[02:29:49.134 --> 02:29:49.595]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.676 --> 02:29:51.576]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.077 --> 02:29:53.678]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.599 --> 02:29:57.302]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.785 --> 02:30:02.887]  Do you know what it means to be an American?
[02:30:03.127 --> 02:30:04.328]  It's more than a flag.
[02:30:04.609 --> 02:30:07.271]  It's more than knowing the star-spangled banner.
[02:30:07.471 --> 02:30:08.852]  It's knowing the Constitution.
[02:30:09.053 --> 02:30:11.935]  It's understanding those rights and fighting for them.
[02:30:12.155 --> 02:30:18.681]  Our country is falling apart because people have forgotten to fight, to stand up in the face of tyranny and do the right thing.
[02:30:18.962 --> 02:30:21.444]  It's putting your life on the line to protect your country.
[02:30:21.704 --> 02:30:22.425]  We're good to go.
[02:30:38.104 --> 02:30:42.568]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com, and I believe our flag is more than cloth and ink.
[02:30:43.009 --> 02:30:45.711]  It is a symbol that stands for liberty and freedom.
[02:30:45.731 --> 02:30:50.776]  It is a history of our nation, and it's marked by the blood of those who died defending it.
[02:30:51.236 --> 02:30:52.938]  So join me in this Infowar.
[02:30:52.978 --> 02:30:57.442]  Turn off your TV, put your Cheetos down, get off your butt and join the resistance.
[02:31:00.657 --> 02:31:03.639]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[02:32:34.781 --> 02:32:38.742]  Introducing the new InfoWarsLife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[02:32:38.942 --> 02:32:43.723]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[02:32:43.883 --> 02:32:48.424]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[02:32:48.544 --> 02:32:51.864]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:32:52.024 --> 02:32:55.345]  Now available in our limited first run at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:55.485 --> 02:32:57.285]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:33:03.396 --> 02:33:15.984]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.824 --> 02:33:21.747]  By the way, Jim Mars is going to host the show.
[02:33:21.787 --> 02:33:27.091]  I told everybody that for about six years, I've been on the show 20, it's been syndicated for 18 and a half.
[02:33:28.058 --> 02:33:30.440]  But for about 18 plus years, I've been on from 11 a.m.
[02:33:30.700 --> 02:33:31.280]  to 2 p.m.
[02:33:31.520 --> 02:33:36.604]  And for about five years, six years, about five and a half years, I did a fourth hour.
[02:33:37.064 --> 02:33:42.048]  But when I started doing the nightly news and getting a lot of crew members under me and have a lot of administrative stuff and research stuff.
[02:33:43.163 --> 02:33:45.825]  I shifted and stopped doing the fourth hour because it was just killing me.
[02:33:45.945 --> 02:33:49.007]  I mean, I literally had to go take a nap for like an hour afterwards.
[02:33:49.127 --> 02:33:50.268]  Three hours kills me too.
[02:33:50.908 --> 02:33:52.109]  I think it's the bright lights or whatever.
[02:33:52.129 --> 02:33:56.292]  When I do the show at home every once in a while and it's dark, I just feel great and want to go forever.
[02:33:56.952 --> 02:34:07.899]  I'm actually thinking about sometimes just doing the show from home and having anchors in here that are covering the news, just because people say that sometimes when it's not even video, they say, man, the show's even better when it's just old-fashioned radio.
[02:34:08.319 --> 02:34:10.881]  Maybe a day a week or something, I'm going to start doing that in the future.
[02:34:10.921 --> 02:34:12.302]  But long story short,
[02:34:14.341 --> 02:34:14.882]  Absolutely.
[02:34:15.582 --> 02:34:22.248]  But long story short, Jim Mars is going to be hosting 30 minutes to the next hour by himself in here.
[02:34:22.268 --> 02:34:23.749]  He's a great guy, smart guy.
[02:34:24.269 --> 02:34:28.393]  He can do the whole fourth hour if he wants, because a lot of stations want that fourth hour.
[02:34:28.453 --> 02:34:30.755]  We are going to start having it be a guest host hour.
[02:34:31.235 --> 02:34:32.677]  I'll host it a lot of times as well.
[02:34:32.937 --> 02:34:34.298]  We'll have roundtable discussions.
[02:34:34.358 --> 02:34:35.419]  It'll be a news hour.
[02:34:35.839 --> 02:34:37.320]  It'll be really something special.
[02:34:37.801 --> 02:34:40.043]  Every day, that fourth hour, we're bringing it back.
[02:34:40.083 --> 02:34:41.344]  And some stations never turned it off.
[02:34:41.664 --> 02:34:45.305]  When I quit doing four hours two years ago, a lot of stations still carry it.
[02:34:45.605 --> 02:34:50.086]  So Jim Mars will be doing as much of the fourth hour as he wants.
[02:34:50.386 --> 02:34:52.147]  In fact, I predict he'll want to do the whole thing.
[02:34:52.407 --> 02:34:54.127]  Cupcake.
[02:34:54.248 --> 02:34:55.368]  So that's coming up.
[02:34:55.388 --> 02:34:57.028]  And if you want, you can give the number out and take calls.
[02:34:57.048 --> 02:35:00.249]  But before I do that, we have to self-fund here.
[02:35:01.409 --> 02:35:10.332]  And I simply go out and whatever I use, what I like, what I think is neat, is what I end up trying to go out to the distributor, to the manufacturer, and get.
[02:35:11.658 --> 02:35:17.773]  G-Shock watches are the original tough watches, so they're the most state-of-the-art and the most updated today.
[02:35:17.893 --> 02:35:19.598]  Military uses them, everybody knows that.
[02:35:20.532 --> 02:35:25.618]  And they're also very, very affordable compared to other watches that don't even have the same tolerances.
[02:35:26.038 --> 02:35:27.620]  We now have a wide selection.
[02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:33.046]  We're adding them right now to InfoWareStore.com of the G-Shock family.
[02:35:33.847 --> 02:35:38.512]  We have this distributorship through Head Down, so we're not directly drop shipping through them.
[02:35:39.133 --> 02:35:41.135]  And we're carrying the Vortex Viper.
[02:35:41.756 --> 02:35:41.936]  I don't
[02:36:00.951 --> 02:36:03.672]  All the very best stuff that is at the best price.
[02:36:04.853 --> 02:36:09.814]  Just guaranteed, no games, for your assault rifle, for your handgun, for your revolver.
[02:36:10.275 --> 02:36:10.995]  It's all there.
[02:36:11.155 --> 02:36:12.776]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:36:13.296 --> 02:36:17.978]  You go over on the right-hand side, and you'll see InfoWars Live, made in 1776.

[02:36:32.913 --> 02:36:33.373]  Optics.
[02:36:34.474 --> 02:36:46.580]  So, optics, watches, all the hardware you need, that way you get a great price, and the small profit that's there, wish it was huge profit, we could fund things easier, then helps fund the reporters, the research, the work we're doing.
[02:36:46.940 --> 02:36:56.065]  InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com where you can go and find all of our high-quality supplements.
[02:36:57.472 --> 02:36:57.612]  I don't
[02:37:19.853 --> 02:37:22.897]  I'm going to be taking this at night about 10 o'clock because I've got to get up early tomorrow and do a bunch of stuff.
[02:37:23.418 --> 02:37:25.039]  And the thing is, I just keep wound up.
[02:37:25.060 --> 02:37:31.628]  Even though I haven't had coffee since like noon, I just want to stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning and then I'm exhausted when my kids get up at 6 or 37 in the morning.
[02:37:32.088 --> 02:37:36.393]  Well, I can take knockout and within an hour, man, I am sleeping deep and I don't wake up.
[02:37:37.034 --> 02:37:42.437]  Even if the dog or the cat's jumping on me, or the kids try to come in, or thunder and lightning, or whatever.
[02:37:42.757 --> 02:37:45.218]  So, infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[02:37:45.558 --> 02:37:51.781]  We can answer all your questions about optics, about watches, about shortwave radios, cook stoves, water filters.
[02:37:52.421 --> 02:37:59.084]  It's basically, I'm a guy, you know, don't get me near a Cabela's, don't get me near a hardware store.
[02:37:59.344 --> 02:38:04.086]  I'll be in a little town, see a little gun shop, or a little hunting supply shop, I'm in there.
[02:38:04.526 --> 02:38:11.909]  Well, this is the very best stuff, and then you're not just getting some fun stuff for your cabin, or your vacation house, or your garage, or your truck.
[02:38:12.549 --> 02:38:14.730]  Or presents for your kids, your husband or whatever.
[02:38:15.351 --> 02:38:21.114]  You're funding a hardcore liberty operation while getting your rifles ready for hunting or self-defense or whatever the case is.
[02:38:21.595 --> 02:38:25.337]  So, it's all available at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:38:25.737 --> 02:38:30.500]  Okay, you have the floor and get practiced because you're going to be hosting the next hour.
[02:38:31.020 --> 02:38:33.962]  And you'll have some breaks to get up and go to the Tinkle area.
[02:38:34.022 --> 02:38:38.845]  But Jim Mars, my good buddy, best-selling author, is here with a new book, Population Control.
[02:38:38.885 --> 02:38:39.426]  This is a book
[02:38:40.186 --> 02:38:41.166]  I can really get behind.
[02:38:41.527 --> 02:38:45.828]  You've had a lot of other amazing books, but I kind of know about JFK because I read your book 25 years ago.
[02:38:46.349 --> 02:38:50.050]  And you can write a book about the rise of the Nazis and how the Fourth Reich's connected to Islam.
[02:38:50.410 --> 02:38:51.051]  I kind of know that.
[02:38:51.071 --> 02:38:51.691]  A lot of folks don't.
[02:38:52.071 --> 02:38:57.813]  This new book, I was reading through it, got a lot of stuff I didn't know, and it really puts it all together for the case.
[02:38:58.214 --> 02:38:59.514]  We ought to sell this ourselves.
[02:39:00.254 --> 02:39:00.755]  We don't yet.
[02:39:00.795 --> 02:39:01.575]  We saw a lot of your books.
[02:39:02.035 --> 02:39:03.596]  And dovetail it with Endgame.
[02:39:04.016 --> 02:39:09.519]  Because my film, Endgame, covers a lot of this as well, that their endgame is take over, shut off the resources, and kill everybody.
[02:39:09.899 --> 02:39:12.601]  So, Jim Mars, people can go to your website and also get the book.
[02:39:12.621 --> 02:39:13.401]  Give them your website.
[02:39:14.002 --> 02:39:17.163]  Website, oddly enough, is jimmars.com.
[02:39:17.263 --> 02:39:19.225]  J-I-M-M-A-R-R-S.
[02:39:19.285 --> 02:39:20.405]  Two R's in Mars.
[02:39:20.525 --> 02:39:21.646]  A good Scottish name.
[02:39:21.666 --> 02:39:23.467]  Aye, correct, you are.
[02:39:23.487 --> 02:39:25.948]  Can you do a Scottish accent for me?
[02:39:26.108 --> 02:39:26.969]  Uh, uh, no.
[02:39:27.029 --> 02:39:29.470]  We there, buckin's comin', I can't even do it.
[02:39:32.569 --> 02:39:36.870]  I don't know, I think I lost my Scottish accent.
[02:39:36.910 --> 02:39:38.451]  You look like a Scottish guy though.
[02:39:39.031 --> 02:39:39.731]  Yeah, it's true.
[02:39:40.072 --> 02:39:49.915]  Speaking of, did you hear where there's a famous pub in Scotland and the manager's announced they have a new policy that they're making the waiters wear pants?
[02:39:50.675 --> 02:39:58.141]  Because, this is true, because too many women were coming in and trying to pull up their kilts to see what they were wearing.
[02:39:58.181 --> 02:40:04.866]  And they said, at first it was funny, he said, I hear women go after the Scotch on their kilts.
[02:40:05.146 --> 02:40:05.927]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:40:05.947 --> 02:40:07.068]  There's nothing feminine about it.
[02:40:07.128 --> 02:40:08.709]  I mean, it's comfortable.
[02:40:09.549 --> 02:40:10.370]  Manly kilts.
[02:40:11.031 --> 02:40:11.671]  Absolutely.
[02:40:12.312 --> 02:40:17.956]  And then I could wear a kilt and then be on TV and get a Courage Award like Caitlyn Jenner at ESPN.
[02:40:17.976 --> 02:40:19.137]  That's right.
[02:40:20.510 --> 02:40:25.453]  Hey, you can declare because you feel like it that you're a third gender.
[02:40:25.973 --> 02:40:26.374]  Wait a minute.
[02:40:26.434 --> 02:40:27.174]  I'm going to go to you in a minute.
[02:40:27.194 --> 02:40:29.535]  Can we pull up that I've announced I've come out of the closet?
[02:40:30.336 --> 02:40:31.136]  Can you guys pull it up?
[02:40:32.077 --> 02:40:33.898]  Are the videos Alex Jones comes out of the closet?
[02:40:35.879 --> 02:40:44.965]  I've come out of the closet, but not that I'm a woman, or not that I'm gay, but not that I'm a space alien or a blood-drinking lizard from the planet Pop-Tart.
[02:40:45.545 --> 02:40:46.405]  No, I've come out.
[02:40:46.425 --> 02:40:47.086]  Do we have the video ready?
[02:40:50.117 --> 02:40:51.118]  Yeah, we're going to pull it up.
[02:40:51.158 --> 02:40:52.418]  I mean, it's in the system.
[02:40:52.438 --> 02:40:53.539]  I know I just sprung it on you.
[02:40:54.580 --> 02:40:56.221]  The video's on InfoWars.com.
[02:40:56.321 --> 02:40:57.922]  Alex Jones has now come out of the closet.
[02:40:58.262 --> 02:41:01.944]  While they're finding out, what do you think this obsession with this stuff is?
[02:41:02.344 --> 02:41:07.768]  Is it about diverting from the fact that we're all losing our basic rights so the new right is that women can be standing up?
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:10.160]  I don't know.
[02:41:10.180 --> 02:41:16.802]  To me it's proof of the psychological problem that they've noticed with rats.
[02:41:16.922 --> 02:41:20.683]  You know, you put a few rats in a cage, they get along just fine.
[02:41:20.723 --> 02:41:25.245]  You put too many rats in a cage, they start going nuts and they turn on each other.
[02:41:25.705 --> 02:41:27.065]  And I think maybe that's it.
[02:41:27.125 --> 02:41:29.126]  There's too many people crammed together and
[02:41:29.946 --> 02:41:33.090]  And so people don't feel like they have a future, they don't feel like they can be creative.
[02:41:33.430 --> 02:41:37.295]  Used to you wanted to explore, you wanted to invent, you wanted to build, you wanted to have art.
[02:41:37.675 --> 02:41:42.081]  Now it's, I'm gonna have green arm hair, that shows that I'm mad at men, I'm gonna pee standing up.
[02:41:42.121 --> 02:41:42.782]  I mean, I'm not joking.
[02:41:42.942 --> 02:41:45.445]  They have serious shows going, women are peeing standing up.
[02:41:45.505 --> 02:41:46.646]  This is the true feminism.
[02:41:47.287 --> 02:41:49.189]  And it's just like, it's just stupid.
[02:41:49.930 --> 02:41:51.291]  Well, I don't care.
[02:41:51.371 --> 02:41:54.654]  Like Bruce Jenner... I mean, I'm gonna freak out if I walk in the men's bathroom when that's going on.
[02:41:55.275 --> 02:42:00.759]  Bruce Jenner can call himself anything he wants to, but when it comes down to it, biologically, he's a man.
[02:42:00.779 --> 02:42:04.683]  Did you see what they said on CNN?
[02:42:04.743 --> 02:42:07.365]  One of the co-hosts said, I'll put you in a hospital if you say that again.
[02:42:08.245 --> 02:42:11.468]  Oh yeah, that's tolerance.
[02:42:12.388 --> 02:42:16.491]  The leftists and the crazies, they practice tolerance.
[02:42:16.531 --> 02:42:19.814]  And if you don't want tolerance, they'll beat the crap out of you and put you in the hospital.
[02:42:20.094 --> 02:42:21.895]  I would think of you as a classical liberal.
[02:42:21.935 --> 02:42:25.418]  You're for drug decriminalization, you're for alternative energy.
[02:42:25.438 --> 02:42:29.501]  I mean, liberals really like you, but you're not a fascist.
[02:42:30.181 --> 02:42:33.884]  I mean, you're not wanting to arrest... It's not that we care if some guy wants to be a woman.
[02:42:34.344 --> 02:42:35.305]  I don't want to pay for it.
[02:42:35.925 --> 02:42:37.746]  No, and I differ with you.
[02:42:37.786 --> 02:42:39.627]  I've never thought of myself as a liberal.
[02:42:39.667 --> 02:42:41.487]  I think of myself more as a conservative.
[02:42:41.688 --> 02:42:44.169]  Well, I meant like a classical liberal like Thomas Jefferson.
[02:42:44.189 --> 02:42:44.789]  Well, that's it.
[02:42:44.849 --> 02:42:48.130]  It's like, if you're conservative, what is it that you want to conserve?
[02:42:48.891 --> 02:42:55.834]  Too many so-called conservatives today, particularly the rhinos, you know, they want to conserve the status quo.
[02:42:56.294 --> 02:42:56.994]  And that's not me.
[02:42:57.074 --> 02:43:02.257]  What I want to conserve is the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the idea of freedom.
[02:43:02.277 --> 02:43:02.997]  Private property.
[02:43:03.137 --> 02:43:03.557]  Do what you want.
[02:43:03.577 --> 02:43:05.378]  Private property and equality.
[02:43:05.558 --> 02:43:15.442]  You know, when the civil rights thing came around, I stopped and thought about it, and I was a good old redneck southern Texas boy, but I thought, you know, they got a point.
[02:43:15.522 --> 02:43:18.944]  Why should somebody be discriminated against because of the color of their skin?
[02:43:19.364 --> 02:43:21.685]  I said, I'm backing off.
[02:43:21.745 --> 02:43:22.646]  I'm going to help them out.
[02:43:22.986 --> 02:43:24.586]  Let's all just be equal.
[02:43:25.067 --> 02:43:27.368]  But, you know, it's not even equal anymore.
[02:43:28.519 --> 02:43:30.320]  Now it's reverse racism.
[02:43:31.041 --> 02:43:44.048]  And people just don't get it because, you know, I think everybody, if I say I'm going to vote for this person because he's black, okay, well, you know, that's just as much racism as to say I'm going to vote against him.
[02:43:44.068 --> 02:43:47.490]  I would vote for a black Ron Paul and wouldn't even think what color they were.
[02:43:47.530 --> 02:43:47.730]  Right.
[02:43:47.991 --> 02:43:49.391]  And I could literally, or a woman.
[02:43:49.692 --> 02:43:52.013]  But they're going to make, if we don't want Hillary, that we're against women.
[02:43:52.233 --> 02:43:53.034]  Well, no, no, no.
[02:43:53.074 --> 02:43:54.276]  See, that's the same way.
[02:43:54.697 --> 02:43:57.261]  I have no problem at all with a woman in the White House.
[02:43:57.361 --> 02:44:00.165]  I just... Not Hillary, because I don't think she qualifies.
[02:44:00.786 --> 02:44:03.150]  Well, yeah, because she probably actually is a man in drug.
[02:44:03.911 --> 02:44:05.053]  She's the reverse of Jenner.
[02:44:06.095 --> 02:44:07.397]  Well... No, actually, she is Jenner.
[02:44:09.979 --> 02:44:10.980]  Generally speaking.
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:11.860]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:44:11.900 --> 02:44:14.441]  You know, they actually say that Michelle is a tranny.
[02:44:14.741 --> 02:44:22.044]  Yeah, I heard that and I snickered that one off until I really looked at it seriously and I think there's some question there.
[02:44:23.745 --> 02:44:25.926]  You don't think that's like a cigar she's had in her pants?
[02:44:26.226 --> 02:44:27.246]  Well, it could be.
[02:44:27.526 --> 02:44:28.246]  It could be.
[02:44:28.847 --> 02:44:30.727]  She might just have saggy panties.
[02:44:30.827 --> 02:44:31.248]  I don't know.
[02:44:36.334 --> 02:44:37.295]  I don't want to go there.
[02:44:37.835 --> 02:44:44.880]  I'm still having trouble enough trying to tell people, explain the problem of two planes knocking down three buildings.
[02:44:47.181 --> 02:44:51.344]  Maybe when they El Chapo Jeter it shot off like a missile and blew up Building 7.
[02:44:53.245 --> 02:44:54.846]  I mean, that makes as much sense.
[02:44:54.866 --> 02:44:55.967]  Okay, I'm going to stop right there.
[02:44:56.007 --> 02:44:56.908]  It's a family show.
[02:44:57.168 --> 02:44:58.409]  But this is what's in the news.
[02:44:58.749 --> 02:44:59.970]  How do you not talk about it?
[02:45:00.730 --> 02:45:03.132]  I mean, they're just force-feeding all this garbage.
[02:45:04.148 --> 02:45:04.849]  We do have the video.
[02:45:04.909 --> 02:45:05.990]  So this is my coming out.
[02:45:06.411 --> 02:45:10.135]  I have become a dog, a bloodhound.
[02:45:11.317 --> 02:45:15.642]  I am trans species, and if you don't agree with it, then you're a racist.
[02:45:15.662 --> 02:45:16.002]  Here it is.
[02:45:16.483 --> 02:45:20.127]  But if you love your dog... You know, Caitlyn Jenner is actually the real El Chapo.
[02:45:21.004 --> 02:45:24.126]  The problem is he hasn't actually done the chopping, so I say he's a fraud.
[02:45:24.146 --> 02:45:24.907]  But me?
[02:45:25.647 --> 02:45:28.829]  I've gone and I've had surgery and I've had these prosthesis ears added.
[02:45:28.849 --> 02:45:34.553]  I am now choosing to be trans-zoological, I believe is the term.
[02:45:35.254 --> 02:45:40.517]  I may as well be trans-abled and chop my arms and legs off and be known as a biscuit and live in a box, but taken care of.
[02:45:40.537 --> 02:45:41.938]  And if you don't accept it, you're hateful.
[02:45:41.998 --> 02:45:48.303]  In fact, if you don't adopt my lifestyle and wear dirty brown socks on your ears after you work out,
[02:45:48.863 --> 02:45:53.745]  You're a racist, you're a homophobe, you're an anti-zoological phobe, you're a piece of filth.
[02:45:54.065 --> 02:45:56.246]  So now, I become my new self.
[02:46:03.513 --> 02:46:04.834]  You know, I saw the latest conspiracy.
[02:46:04.854 --> 02:46:05.974]  I think I sent it to Nico.
[02:46:06.714 --> 02:46:12.016]  It's sad, but all these schizophrenics and mentally ill people that are now online, they have a voice, which is good.
[02:46:12.036 --> 02:46:12.857]  Everybody has a voice now.
[02:46:12.877 --> 02:46:13.077]  Sure.
[02:46:13.337 --> 02:46:15.037]  But now they don't just think I'm Bill Hicks.
[02:46:15.057 --> 02:46:18.759]  They think Rush Limbaugh is, wait for it, Jim Morrison.
[02:46:19.119 --> 02:46:20.079]  Oh my God.
[02:46:20.179 --> 02:46:22.680]  I mean, that one is even better.
[02:46:23.020 --> 02:46:24.321]  That was a good one, Alex.
[02:46:24.441 --> 02:46:27.322]  I've got a fire hydrant out there I want to introduce you to.
[02:46:30.347 --> 02:46:30.827]  Oh yeah!
[02:46:31.808 --> 02:46:32.348]  You'll love it.
[02:46:32.989 --> 02:46:33.829]  Love it for sure.
[02:46:33.909 --> 02:46:36.771]  Actually, since I put those ears on, I have been peeing on fire hydrants.
[02:46:37.832 --> 02:46:39.012]  And it's my right to do it.
[02:46:39.232 --> 02:46:39.673]  That's right.
[02:46:40.053 --> 02:46:41.034]  It's my right.
[02:46:41.074 --> 02:46:42.334]  I deserve a courage award.
[02:46:42.374 --> 02:46:42.855]  There it is.
[02:46:43.395 --> 02:46:44.676]  Rush Limbaugh, a.k.a.
[02:46:44.696 --> 02:46:47.337]  Jim Morrison, was Bill Hicks, a.k.a.
[02:46:47.437 --> 02:46:49.959]  Alex Jones' influence to get on radio.
[02:46:49.979 --> 02:46:51.600]  So that's how it's all connected.
[02:46:53.423 --> 02:46:54.444]  I mean, look at this.
[02:46:54.745 --> 02:46:55.946]  This is not satire.
[02:46:55.986 --> 02:46:59.109]  These people actually, back it up, back it up.
[02:46:59.410 --> 02:47:05.376]  They actually, on this video, show side-by-side.
[02:47:08.780 --> 02:47:10.461]  They're so crazy.
[02:47:10.501 --> 02:47:11.542]  How silly can you be?
[02:47:11.562 --> 02:47:14.025]  I mean, everybody knows you're actually Karl Rove.
[02:47:15.669 --> 02:47:15.989]  Oh, man.
[02:47:16.490 --> 02:47:17.591]  David Mendelsohn.
[02:47:18.431 --> 02:47:21.054]  Listen, I did this video where I said I was really a British thespian as a joke.
[02:47:21.114 --> 02:47:22.275]  People think it's real now.
[02:47:22.595 --> 02:47:24.236]  They're searching David Mendelsohn.
[02:47:25.377 --> 02:47:25.878]  That's the thing.
[02:47:26.098 --> 02:47:34.225]  They won't admit that glyphosate is connected to brain damage and that one half of the kids in the country by 2025 are going to be brain damaged.
[02:47:35.728 --> 02:47:37.209]  That's admitted and it's epic.
[02:47:37.449 --> 02:47:39.691]  The government admits fluoride's brain damaging us now.
[02:47:40.012 --> 02:47:40.212]  Right.
[02:47:40.252 --> 02:47:42.494]  But no one will talk, they admit chemtrails are real.
[02:47:42.534 --> 02:47:43.635]  No one will cover the real documents.
[02:47:43.875 --> 02:47:44.856]  They just want to speculate.
[02:47:45.296 --> 02:47:46.898]  And then that's how the media tries to discredit us.
[02:47:47.158 --> 02:47:49.600]  You know I'm just trying to cover up, I'm really, I'm actually Jim Morrison.
[02:47:50.441 --> 02:47:51.161]  I'm insulted.
[02:47:51.221 --> 02:47:55.645]  I mean, I like Bill Hicks at some levels, but I think Jim Morrison as a musician was more interesting.
[02:47:55.905 --> 02:47:57.627]  So actually, I am Jim Morrison.
[02:47:58.788 --> 02:48:01.510]  Well, you're being accused of it, you might as well go for it.
[02:48:04.338 --> 02:48:05.399]  Oh, they're already connecting me.
[02:48:05.439 --> 02:48:08.863]  He says, R.J., Jim, we'll be spawns of Satan together.
[02:48:08.883 --> 02:48:10.204]  Guess they're talking about us.
[02:48:11.085 --> 02:48:12.526]  Actually, are you really Jim Morrison?
[02:48:12.786 --> 02:48:14.128]  You have to do something with your hair.
[02:48:17.022 --> 02:48:17.822]  All right, I'm going to stop.
[02:48:18.502 --> 02:48:22.924]  Start getting into your book, get into the more serious areas, and then, you know, a lot of us go out and have beer together.
[02:48:22.944 --> 02:48:23.584]  That's a lot of fun.
[02:48:23.824 --> 02:48:24.264]  That's right.
[02:48:24.504 --> 02:48:25.905]  And we look up at seven hours has passed?
[02:48:25.925 --> 02:48:28.086]  Hey, that would be your fourth hour right there.
[02:48:28.146 --> 02:48:34.027]  You just move to a local pub and sit around, have a few beers, and then just talk honestly.
[02:48:34.107 --> 02:48:35.448]  Please don't give me that idea.
[02:48:36.653 --> 02:48:39.635]  We've actually had that idea, but I've pretty much quit drinking to lose weight.
[02:48:41.056 --> 02:48:44.578]  And so, you know, I only drink after six now.
[02:48:44.598 --> 02:48:47.619]  And of course, it's always six somewhere on the planet.
[02:48:47.659 --> 02:48:48.960]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:49.841]  I'm not a heavy drinker.
[02:48:49.881 --> 02:48:53.403]  If you're drinking six, maybe you ought to cut it down to two.
[02:48:53.423 --> 02:48:56.264]  I only drink at six, though.
[02:48:56.304 --> 02:48:57.665]  I get it cut from six to two.
[02:48:57.865 --> 02:49:02.928]  I only have two at two, and three at three, and four at four, and five at five, and six at six.
[02:49:03.308 --> 02:49:04.409]  Well, hey, take me.
[02:49:04.509 --> 02:49:05.430]  I don't drink anymore.
[02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:07.021]  Or any less.
[02:49:08.964 --> 02:49:09.464]  Pretty much.
[02:49:09.725 --> 02:49:12.349]  No, we'll go have Mexican food and have a Dos Equis or two.
[02:49:12.449 --> 02:49:12.969]  There you go.
[02:49:12.989 --> 02:49:13.771]  I mean, let's be honest.
[02:49:13.791 --> 02:49:14.472]  We're not that cool.
[02:49:16.054 --> 02:49:16.494]  That's true.
[02:49:16.514 --> 02:49:17.135]  That's true.
[02:49:18.297 --> 02:49:19.639]  Anyways, I apologize, Jim Mars.
[02:49:19.659 --> 02:49:20.981]  You're here with your new bestselling book.
[02:49:21.522 --> 02:49:22.163]  Tell us about it.
[02:49:23.735 --> 02:49:43.528]  No, listen, I'm serious about my book, because there's a lot of information in there of how you can protect your family and your loved ones, because they, I mean, okay, when I get my chance, I'm going to tell you about some of the really bad stuff that's going in, everything Aspartame and monosunium.
[02:49:43.808 --> 02:49:47.470]  And most of our audience knows this, but their families don't.
[02:49:47.890 --> 02:49:49.912]  And this way you can go, here's a prestigious author,
[02:49:50.732 --> 02:49:54.375]  Jim Morrison, who's written this new book, you need to read it.
[02:49:56.337 --> 02:50:01.401]  But what I'm gonna tell you is, is that even the good stuff is bad.
[02:50:02.342 --> 02:50:09.127]  The incidence of obesity in this country has shot up 85... Look how fat Jim Morrison got!
[02:50:09.147 --> 02:50:09.968]  That's right.
[02:50:10.248 --> 02:50:13.751]  He used to be really skinny, now he weighs like 400 pounds and hosts a radio show.
[02:50:14.752 --> 02:50:21.518]  I hate to sit here and talk about obesity, but no, Alex, actually, I think you've lost some weight.
[02:50:21.718 --> 02:50:22.279]  I really do.
[02:50:22.799 --> 02:50:23.160]  Thank you.
[02:50:23.180 --> 02:50:24.261]  I really do.
[02:50:26.543 --> 02:50:27.143]  Here's the difference.
[02:50:27.163 --> 02:50:28.665]  In fact, I'm just going to take my clothes off on air.
[02:50:29.178 --> 02:50:29.959]  Let's just do it right now.
[02:50:30.019 --> 02:50:31.381]  No, no, no, no.
[02:50:31.541 --> 02:50:32.202]  I'm dead serious.
[02:50:33.403 --> 02:50:33.944]  Don't do it?
[02:50:34.124 --> 02:50:34.625]  Don't do it.
[02:50:34.665 --> 02:50:35.125]  Well, no, no.
[02:50:35.185 --> 02:50:37.368]  I mean, I'll just show people how much weight I've actually lost.
[02:50:37.909 --> 02:50:39.871]  I've actually lost almost 70 pounds.
[02:50:40.071 --> 02:50:40.432]  I believe.
[02:50:40.812 --> 02:50:42.114]  But that shows how fat I got.
[02:50:42.134 --> 02:50:42.695]  Now I'm like 230.
[02:50:42.735 --> 02:50:43.035]  I was like 280.
[02:50:47.162 --> 02:50:51.228]  Well, I have all the admiration in the world for people that can actually gut it out.
[02:50:51.528 --> 02:50:53.030]  I've been to the doctor and the nutritionist.
[02:50:53.050 --> 02:50:54.412]  I got 10 more pounds to lose.
[02:50:54.652 --> 02:50:54.893]  Wow.
[02:50:55.213 --> 02:50:58.137]  But, um, the thing is I have a really big, giant, round head.
[02:50:58.157 --> 02:51:01.001]  So no matter what I do, it'll always look like I have a big, fat head.

[02:52:00.957 --> 02:52:02.679]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[02:52:02.899 --> 02:52:06.222]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[02:52:06.522 --> 02:52:07.523]  A pair of scissors.
[02:52:07.883 --> 02:52:13.387]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[02:52:13.668 --> 02:52:18.352]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[02:52:18.612 --> 02:52:19.412]  The phone line.
[02:52:19.593 --> 02:52:24.517]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[02:52:24.837 --> 02:52:28.580]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[02:52:28.740 --> 02:52:31.624]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[02:52:32.044 --> 02:52:34.307]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[02:52:34.507 --> 02:52:38.732]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.

[02:53:49.271 --> 02:53:49.651]  IDStronghold.
[02:53:49.691 --> 02:53:51.091]  The original RFID wallet company.
[02:54:04.477 --> 02:54:09.361]  Don't call my name out your window, you naggin' nanny New World Order.
[02:54:09.962 --> 02:54:10.943]  Political correct, people?
[02:54:13.223 --> 02:54:17.786]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving.
[02:54:17.866 --> 02:54:19.488]  I won't even turn my head.
[02:54:19.508 --> 02:54:21.469]  I won't even turn my head.
[02:54:21.529 --> 02:54:24.311]  Don't send your kinfolks around to give me no talking to.
[02:54:24.331 --> 02:54:28.054]  Don't send your kinfolks to give me no talking to.
[02:54:28.174 --> 02:54:29.875]  I'll be gone, like I said.
[02:54:30.176 --> 02:54:31.957]  I'll be gone, like I said.
[02:54:32.798 --> 02:54:34.559]  Think this guy might have gotten a few fights with women.
[02:54:34.599 --> 02:54:38.542]  You would say the same old thing that you've been saying all along.
[02:54:39.502 --> 02:54:46.728]  Lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[02:54:46.768 --> 02:54:48.889]  You speak politically incorrect.
[02:54:49.309 --> 02:54:50.210]  Understand your man.
[02:54:50.470 --> 02:54:53.833]  I use this as the allegory of being fed up with corrupt government.
[02:54:53.873 --> 02:54:57.655]  This is the argument of more like a giant rapist or something.
[02:54:57.755 --> 02:54:59.597]  A male attacking the female, more like it.
[02:55:00.257 --> 02:55:02.159]  Jim Mars, you're going to host the entire next hour.
[02:55:02.179 --> 02:55:03.980]  You're going to take phone calls as well.
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:06.722]  Some stations don't carry the fourth hour, but they're welcome to.
[02:55:06.742 --> 02:55:07.523]  We're reintroducing it.
[02:55:07.543 --> 02:55:08.944]  We're going to start having guest hosts.
[02:55:09.024 --> 02:55:09.844]  I'll host at some.
[02:55:10.125 --> 02:55:11.406]  We'll have roundtable discussions.
[02:55:11.426 --> 02:55:12.747]  Yakari Jackson's going to host.
[02:55:13.167 --> 02:55:14.688]  Rob Dew's going to host.
[02:55:15.169 --> 02:55:16.730]  David Knight's going to host.
[02:55:17.550 --> 02:55:19.132]  Darren McBreen loves to do live.
[02:55:19.192 --> 02:55:20.132]  He's going to be hosting.
[02:55:20.152 --> 02:55:23.095]  We're going to have roundtable with the control room crew.
[02:55:23.235 --> 02:55:24.616]  They're really smart guys and gals.
[02:55:24.976 --> 02:55:25.757]  They're going to be in here.
[02:55:27.213 --> 02:55:28.014]  That's what it's all about.
[02:55:28.694 --> 02:55:33.238]  Three hours of pumpkin head, and then you get the garden gnome.
[02:55:33.378 --> 02:55:35.480]  See, he's calling me names I can just crack back.
[02:55:35.980 --> 02:55:38.282]  Anyways, he actually is a little garden gnome in the Cormont Garden.
[02:55:38.302 --> 02:55:39.583]  That's where he lives in my backyard.
[02:55:39.903 --> 02:55:40.404]  Jim Mars.
[02:55:40.444 --> 02:55:41.385]  Now, Jim Mars is a sweetheart.
[02:55:41.425 --> 02:55:42.165]  Your wife's back there.
[02:55:42.185 --> 02:55:43.166]  I want to say hi to her.
[02:55:43.186 --> 02:55:47.089]  You can take a bathroom break or get some coffee or anything you need during these breaks coming up.
[02:55:47.930 --> 02:55:49.531]  Some stations don't carry a lot due.
[02:55:49.711 --> 02:55:57.154]  Infowars.com forward slash show to find the free video feed and audio feeds to see and hear that fourth hour.
[02:55:57.394 --> 02:55:59.395]  He will be serious for the first 20-30 minutes.
[02:55:59.635 --> 02:56:02.596]  Please go over your book, break it down, and then take phone calls.
[02:56:02.616 --> 02:56:09.800]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231 to talk to Jim Mars.
[02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:17.003]  Actually, he's really Rush Limbaugh, and then the Rush Limbaugh is really Jim Morrison, and I'm really Rush Limbaugh.
[02:56:18.103 --> 02:56:22.967]  I'm the Loch Ness Monster.
[02:56:22.987 --> 02:56:25.048]  So 800-259-9231 is the toll free number to join us.
[02:56:25.268 --> 02:56:27.490]  But you wanted to talk about some good news during the break.
[02:56:28.271 --> 02:56:28.711]  Good news.
[02:56:29.551 --> 02:56:39.975]  Oh yeah, well, you know, consciousness is rising, but it's also creating a problem because the more people wake up, the more the New World Order clamps down.
[02:56:40.315 --> 02:56:40.815]  Absolutely.
[02:56:40.855 --> 02:56:41.776]  Explain that to people.
[02:56:41.816 --> 02:56:45.837]  You're saying when you started doing this 50 years ago, you've been around that long.
[02:56:46.077 --> 02:56:47.618]  In fact, you may actually be the real Gandalf.
[02:56:49.441 --> 02:56:50.241]  No, I'm Santa.
[02:56:53.983 --> 02:56:57.104]  I'm not actually that old, but it's true.
[02:56:57.144 --> 02:57:09.468]  When I started off, and I'd be on radio shows or whatever, and I'd try to tell people, you know, there's a clique of people trying to run the world, and they're meeting in secret societies, and they're trying to set the agenda, and they're trying to run everything.
[02:57:09.948 --> 02:57:13.589]  And I'd get these calls coming in saying, how do you let this guy on the air?
[02:57:13.609 --> 02:57:15.150]  You know, this guy's a nut, you know.
[02:57:15.450 --> 02:57:17.212]  This guy's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:57:17.232 --> 02:57:18.273]  This guy's a buff.
[02:57:18.794 --> 02:57:19.895]  This guy's an idiot.
[02:57:20.816 --> 02:57:21.256]  You know what?
[02:57:21.276 --> 02:57:24.880]  The last 10 years or so, I don't get those calls anymore.
[02:57:25.481 --> 02:57:29.905]  I'm sure those people may still be out there, but they're keeping them to themselves.
[02:57:29.945 --> 02:57:35.311]  You know, it was classified in congressional hearings many years ago that the CIA in the 60s started using that term.
[02:57:35.631 --> 02:57:36.392]  The Clintons in their
[02:57:37.333 --> 02:57:42.918]  First presidential run, it's been released by their library, that they said anyone criticizing them, call them a conspiracy theorist.
[02:57:43.098 --> 02:57:43.779]  Oh, exactly.
[02:57:43.879 --> 02:57:45.040]  No, no, it goes back to 1954.
[02:57:45.100 --> 02:57:53.067]  No, no, no, 1967, I believe, after the Kennedy assassination.
[02:57:53.127 --> 02:58:01.314]  And there was a document filed by the CIA's Division of Intelligence and went to all their bases and all their assets.
[02:58:01.814 --> 02:58:11.357]  And if you know anything about Malkinburg, it went to the media and it said anybody that's questioning, basically anybody questions the government, you call them a conspiracy theorist.
[02:58:12.038 --> 02:58:18.620]  And that's why it's interesting, I have a 1940 dictionary and you go look up conspiracy and it says a plan.
[02:58:19.380 --> 02:58:20.121]  That's all it was, a plot.
[02:58:20.201 --> 02:58:24.864]  Yeah, so if we ever talk about bad people having plans in government or corporations, it doesn't exist.
[02:58:25.065 --> 02:58:26.226]  Well, everybody knows it does.
[02:58:26.546 --> 02:58:26.946]  Of course.
[02:58:27.827 --> 02:58:32.931]  Our legal system puts people in jail every year, convicted of conspiracy.
[02:58:33.231 --> 02:58:38.936]  Ladies and gentlemen, in 70 seconds, we return with the fourth hour, hosted by Jim Marsh.
[02:58:39.036 --> 02:58:39.896]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:43.940 --> 02:58:47.903]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:51.281 --> 02:58:56.304]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[02:59:07.331 --> 02:59:10.673]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[02:59:53.753 --> 02:59:56.383]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:06.892 --> 03:00:11.074]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:11.734 --> 03:00:12.535]  You want answers?
[03:00:13.315 --> 03:00:14.215]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.856 --> 03:00:18.497]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:19.057 --> 03:00:23.119]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:37.802 --> 03:00:41.445]  There are different philosophies that govern populations of humans.
[03:00:42.586 --> 03:00:43.626]  That's undisputable.
[03:00:45.928 --> 03:00:50.892]  And we've seen in the last century communism sold as the rebellion against capitalism.
[03:00:52.273 --> 03:01:01.399]  When we should see a rebellion of capitalism against insider mafia rule known as crony capitalism.
[03:01:03.221 --> 03:01:05.843]  But if you look at a country like Mexico,
[03:01:08.544 --> 03:01:17.747]  That has, depending on which resource you look at, about three times the natural resource on average that the United States does.
[03:01:17.807 --> 03:01:23.829]  But why can't Mexico ever seem to become wealthy or free?
[03:01:24.889 --> 03:01:26.990]  Well, they never got out from under colonialism.
[03:01:27.910 --> 03:01:29.691]  You can argue we never did 100% either.
[03:01:33.432 --> 03:01:36.753]  And folks in Mexico are really smart and innovative.
[03:01:38.186 --> 03:01:50.595]  But using Mexico as an allegory or an analogy or a parallel, I went and saw a movie Saturday night that everyone should go see that I want to get the director of on, and it was Cartel Land.
[03:01:53.097 --> 03:01:57.881]  And it shot about 80% of it inside Mexico, about 20% on the Arizona border.
[03:02:01.023 --> 03:02:05.727]  And it shows the Mexican militias that have taken back large parts of the country.
[03:02:09.600 --> 03:02:13.203]  But then only themselves to become a mafia again.
[03:02:15.324 --> 03:02:20.929]  And they all say, well if we don't do it, somebody else will do it.
[03:02:22.370 --> 03:02:31.257]  And then they lock up the founder of the movement and put him, I'm giving the movie away here, put him in federal prison at the end because he won't go along with it.
[03:02:33.999 --> 03:02:36.901]  It was the winner, Best Documentary Sundance Film Festival.
[03:02:37.501 --> 03:02:38.122]  It's that good.
[03:02:39.352 --> 03:02:41.313]  And what's crazy is it's actually fair.
[03:02:41.393 --> 03:02:43.394]  It just shows the humanity of both sides.
[03:02:44.214 --> 03:02:58.019]  It actually puts the Minutemen, it's not the Minutemen group itself, a similar vigilante group, on the same level as the Mexican vigilantes.
[03:02:58.679 --> 03:03:00.340]  It doesn't say they're perfect, they're just human.
[03:03:01.564 --> 03:03:11.209]  But it shows the police cooking the methamphetamine, it shows all the different gangs, and that's all it is, is rival gangs in the Mexican economy.
[03:03:11.749 --> 03:03:17.992]  They have different rival gangs bidding with each other to try to get other people to join the other gang.
[03:03:18.412 --> 03:03:20.713]  They have an economy based on the Dark Ages.
[03:03:20.913 --> 03:03:22.494]  Mexico is back in the Dark Ages now.
[03:03:25.095 --> 03:03:27.817]  Because everything becomes, how big is your gang?
[03:03:28.717 --> 03:03:30.218]  And you've got the central government,
[03:03:31.343 --> 03:03:32.444]  The Army, the Marines.
[03:03:34.406 --> 03:03:36.367]  Would the Marines build as the non-corrupt group?
[03:03:36.407 --> 03:03:37.068]  That's not true.
[03:03:39.049 --> 03:03:40.190]  Though they're not as bad as the Army.
[03:03:42.512 --> 03:03:50.279]  Who basically go and shut down the militias, then reconstitute them with their operatives inside, who are actually narcotics traffickers.
[03:03:50.619 --> 03:03:59.106]  And they don't say it in the movie, but it's clear the government of Mexico and the United States are the ones organizing all this, and it's come out in court.
[03:04:00.441 --> 03:04:01.681]  So I don't know why they didn't put it in the movie.
[03:04:03.662 --> 03:04:25.988]  That El Chapo and his number two guy and all of them, when they're in court, with his number two guy, this is even in the El Paso Times, Chicago Tribune, three years ago, were working for the CIA, DEA, and FBI, running all the major drug operations, and had been armed to take out the specific
[03:04:27.472 --> 03:04:30.075]  Cartels not controlled by the Federal Reserve.
[03:04:30.995 --> 03:04:39.524]  And I had a former DEA agent on Sully Castile that they went and set up and raided his house and put in jail after he came on.
[03:04:41.846 --> 03:04:51.215]  When he said they tried to hire him, because he was a Vietnam vet, to train Los Zetas and other cartels working for the CIA
[03:04:53.598 --> 03:04:58.920]  Before El Chapo, before this was ever in the news, before the war in Mexico started eight years ago.
[03:05:00.821 --> 03:05:13.906]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[03:05:15.202 --> 03:05:26.971]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[03:05:27.191 --> 03:05:43.483]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[03:05:43.923 --> 03:05:47.205]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming.
[03:05:47.506 --> 03:05:48.506]  It's already here.
[03:05:48.946 --> 03:05:52.669]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance.
[03:05:53.169 --> 03:05:54.550]  InfoWars.com
[03:05:59.634 --> 03:06:05.237]  Supermail Vitality is InfoWarsLife.com's number one selling product for a good reason.
[03:06:05.557 --> 03:06:06.037]  It works.

[03:06:29.797 --> 03:06:34.843]  Super Mel Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com has sold out multiple times in the last three months.
[03:06:34.983 --> 03:06:42.328]  To fix that problem, we have now produced the biggest and most concentrated high-quality batch of Super Mel Vitality in the product's history.

[03:06:59.500 --> 03:07:00.721]  Another major health threat.
[03:07:00.761 --> 03:07:05.664]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[03:07:05.744 --> 03:07:08.386]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[03:07:08.406 --> 03:07:15.190]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[03:07:15.470 --> 03:07:18.332]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[03:07:18.452 --> 03:07:21.394]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[03:07:21.414 --> 03:07:23.395]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[03:07:23.435 --> 03:07:26.277]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[03:07:26.357 --> 03:07:31.859]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[03:07:32.079 --> 03:07:35.561]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[03:07:35.581 --> 03:07:38.562]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[03:07:38.682 --> 03:07:45.765]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[03:07:45.985 --> 03:07:49.046]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[03:07:55.609 --> 03:07:57.530]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:08:03.732 --> 03:08:09.735]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:10.355 --> 03:08:13.396]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:14.997 --> 03:08:17.418]  The intro you're hearing has aired for 18 years.
[03:08:17.438 --> 03:08:19.219]  I've been syndicated for 18 years.
[03:08:20.039 --> 03:08:20.419]  On air for 20.
[03:08:20.479 --> 03:08:23.741]  Soon to be 21 in about 4 or 5 months.
[03:08:26.158 --> 03:08:28.761]  Hard to believe 21 years on air soon.
[03:08:31.003 --> 03:08:35.527]  And I meant it tongue-in-cheek then, you know, broadcasting from deep behind enemy lines.
[03:08:36.448 --> 03:08:40.172]  Because originally there was another little intro before that that was clips from Red Dawn.
[03:08:42.244 --> 03:08:43.585]  Where the chair is against the wall.
[03:08:43.625 --> 03:08:44.825]  Chair is against the wall.
[03:08:44.865 --> 03:08:46.806]  John has a long mustache.
[03:08:46.846 --> 03:08:49.867]  You know, coded messages from unoccupied U.S.
[03:08:49.927 --> 03:08:51.328]  into the occupied U.S.
[03:08:51.968 --> 03:08:55.370]  And for all of you on or behind enemy lines, this song's for you.
[03:08:55.390 --> 03:08:58.912]  And then it would cut from that into that intro.
[03:09:00.532 --> 03:09:02.793]  But now, 18 years later, almost 19 years later,
[03:09:06.032 --> 03:09:06.812]  We're under FEMA.
[03:09:07.173 --> 03:09:08.513]  The NSA does whatever it wants.
[03:09:08.833 --> 03:09:10.294]  The CIA spies on Congress.
[03:09:10.634 --> 03:09:12.355]  Obama rules by executive fiat.
[03:09:12.936 --> 03:09:15.457]  We're going under TPP that no one's even allowed to read.
[03:09:15.477 --> 03:09:21.120]  The three subsections that have been leaked by WikiLeaks are just so draconian across the board.
[03:09:23.541 --> 03:09:33.126]  And they've got the Ford Foundation hyping racial division so we're all fighting with each other over race instead of about how all of us collectively are losing our basic freedoms.
[03:09:34.206 --> 03:09:42.370]  We're going to be talking to William Benny, former Technical Director of the National Security Agency, huge whistleblower about some of the big developments concerning the NSA that have come out.
[03:09:44.411 --> 03:09:48.873]  And we'll take some phone calls if he's up for it with your specific questions.
[03:09:50.854 --> 03:09:53.496]  And you can tweet at RealAlexJones with your questions as well.
[03:09:55.276 --> 03:10:02.140]  But our video is up on DrudgeReport.com, up at the very top of one of the major columns.
[03:10:04.005 --> 03:10:07.047]  And you can just link through and watch the video.
[03:10:07.067 --> 03:10:08.888]  It's on the left-hand side.
[03:10:09.749 --> 03:10:10.229]  Video.
[03:10:10.369 --> 03:10:13.991]  Liberal signed petition to support white privilege tax.
[03:10:19.795 --> 03:10:23.377]  And I'd say about what, it's the same paradigm out in LA.
[03:10:23.557 --> 03:10:29.041]  Eight out of ten people, Hispanic, it looks like, Arab, and black,
[03:10:30.254 --> 03:10:32.936]  Sign a petition to make white people pay 1% tax.
[03:10:33.296 --> 03:10:34.738]  Doesn't matter if you just came here from Russia.
[03:10:34.758 --> 03:10:35.999]  Doesn't matter if you're Polish.
[03:10:36.299 --> 03:10:38.941]  Doesn't matter if you're an Italian immigrant or Romanian.
[03:10:39.621 --> 03:10:43.925]  And you know, of course the Hispanics that are out there are part Spanish or Portuguese.
[03:10:44.977 --> 03:10:47.798]  A lot of Germans settled in Mexico and Latin America as well.
[03:10:48.038 --> 03:10:49.278]  So you're European as well.
[03:10:49.298 --> 03:10:56.781]  I mean, it's just so crazy that with all the reparations talk being so mainline, you could have this going on.
[03:10:57.161 --> 03:11:00.042]  And meanwhile, I wanted to ask William Binney about this.
[03:11:02.003 --> 03:11:11.886]  It's now come out that Obama has a secret database, data mining into everything you do, data mining into local government, Google, you name it, to create a database of your racial connections.
[03:11:13.308 --> 03:11:18.332]  To start federal fines and fees to quote show white bias.
[03:11:18.372 --> 03:11:19.873]  You can't make this up.
[03:11:19.893 --> 03:11:21.355]  So this is what the data mining is all about.
[03:11:21.375 --> 03:11:23.656]  Then another article dealing with data mining.
[03:11:24.357 --> 03:11:28.841]  Obama pushes to extend gun control background checks to Social Security.
[03:11:30.222 --> 03:11:32.604]  That if you have a Social Security disability.
[03:11:35.731 --> 03:11:40.172]  So you're getting disability, you will not be able to own a gun and will have to turn your guns in.
[03:11:40.652 --> 03:11:42.552]  Not a felon, not a criminal, nothing wrong.
[03:11:42.932 --> 03:11:45.553]  You're handicapped in a wheelchair, need a firearm in a bad area?
[03:11:45.913 --> 03:11:47.373]  The police are coming to take your gun.
[03:11:48.013 --> 03:11:53.114]  We reported on this on Saturday and I saw comments on InfoWars.com saying this can't be true.
[03:11:53.314 --> 03:11:54.954]  This is in the LA Times today.
[03:11:57.595 --> 03:12:04.616]  They're going to use a Department of Veterans Affairs program that they've been using for a decade on veterans
[03:12:05.768 --> 03:12:08.190]  To manage who has their firearms taken.
[03:12:11.093 --> 03:12:11.834]  It says that right here.
[03:12:11.854 --> 03:12:23.925]  So see, the don't treat list in the military that have been out for a year, been around for four or five years, where you just cannot get treatment for operable cancer, operable heart problems.
[03:12:24.345 --> 03:12:25.306]  You're just given pills.
[03:12:25.706 --> 03:12:26.507]  Oh, your knee's bad?
[03:12:26.587 --> 03:12:27.168]  Here's a cane.
[03:12:28.103 --> 03:12:30.825]  What did Dr. Blaylock say over and over again on this show about Obamacare?
[03:12:31.045 --> 03:12:35.629]  It'll be the model of the VA, and once we get it, they'll say, no knee surgery, here's a cane.
[03:12:36.069 --> 03:12:37.810]  No cornea surgery, here's glasses.
[03:12:38.771 --> 03:12:41.293]  They got more doctors than anybody else in the world, per capita.
[03:12:41.633 --> 03:12:43.174]  In Cuba, you just can't get any service.
[03:12:45.256 --> 03:12:45.897]  And it's down here.
[03:12:45.977 --> 03:12:49.039]  And it's all managed by computers and databases.
[03:12:49.940 --> 03:12:51.421]  William Binney's gonna be breaking this down.
[03:12:51.441 --> 03:12:52.802]  I wanted to get his take on this first.
[03:12:53.262 --> 03:12:56.485]  CNBC, Wesley Clark, former top U.S.
[03:12:56.525 --> 03:12:56.785]  general,
[03:12:58.510 --> 03:13:00.372]  Former top NATO General.
[03:13:01.753 --> 03:13:04.656]  Former Supreme Allied Commander of Europe for NATO.
[03:13:08.079 --> 03:13:10.641]  Advocates rounding up radicalized and disloyal Americans.
[03:13:12.063 --> 03:13:16.687]  Oh, like this guy already being watched by the FBI who shot and killed five people in Chattanooga?
[03:13:17.728 --> 03:13:20.971]  And his dad connected to networks that are under scrutiny?
[03:13:22.366 --> 03:13:32.909]  Just like Major Hassan, the NSA had him with overseas communiques, and the CIA blocked for two years an investigation of Hassan, who was being handled by Anwar al-Awlaki.
[03:13:35.150 --> 03:13:36.330]  And they didn't call that terror either.
[03:13:36.710 --> 03:13:37.431]  Why are they doing this?
[03:13:37.611 --> 03:13:39.291]  Because they use it to get more domestic funding.
[03:13:39.491 --> 03:13:40.912]  But now he wants to lock people up.
[03:13:41.112 --> 03:13:43.512]  But when you read deeper, they've SWAT teamed William Binney.
[03:13:43.673 --> 03:13:44.553]  They tried to put him in jail.
[03:13:44.733 --> 03:13:46.433]  They put record numbers of journalists in jail.
[03:13:46.753 --> 03:13:51.475]  They admit, at the Homeland Security level, it was first leaked to us seven years ago, it's now declassified.
[03:13:53.294 --> 03:14:06.063]  I had State Police, Federal Marshal, and others look at me, multiple documents on record, where they said veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, constitutionalists, and then anti-war activists are listed as the real terror threat.
[03:14:08.865 --> 03:14:13.388]  And here's Wesley Clark, just setting the table for how this stuff is going to affect everybody.
[03:14:14.128 --> 03:14:14.809]  Data mining.
[03:14:16.391 --> 03:14:23.453]  That you went in when you had a divorce or you went in when you had a car wreck and they recommended, hey, go see a psychologist about your broken back or whatever.
[03:14:23.813 --> 03:14:25.814]  And then they said, oh, we say you have PTSD.
[03:14:27.615 --> 03:14:32.056]  They just hand out diagnoses like they hand out candy at a barbershop to kids.
[03:14:32.656 --> 03:14:34.157]  And then you're told you can't own a gun anymore.
[03:14:35.871 --> 03:14:36.872]  I told you it was coming.
[03:14:37.152 --> 03:14:39.395]  What they do to the vets, they do to us.
[03:14:39.815 --> 03:14:42.338]  What they do to the least of us, they do to me, Christ said.
[03:14:42.778 --> 03:14:47.443]  What they'll do to unborn babies, what they'll do to old people, what they'll do to vets, they'll do to everybody.
[03:14:53.476 --> 03:14:56.300]  William Benny's take on the general world itself.
[03:14:56.600 --> 03:14:57.401]  He's been to Europe.
[03:14:57.461 --> 03:14:58.723]  He's been speaking around the planet.
[03:14:59.064 --> 03:15:00.646]  He can tell us about that and update.
[03:15:01.026 --> 03:15:01.907]  We're so honored to have him.
[03:15:01.927 --> 03:15:04.491]  But he'll be with us 15 minutes to the next hour.
[03:15:04.511 --> 03:15:09.297]  And we're going to be joined by Wayne Madsen, formerly of the NSA, as well with breaking news.
[03:15:10.589 --> 03:15:12.950]  Well, we've got to identify the people who are most likely to be radicalized.
[03:15:12.970 --> 03:15:14.491]  We've got to cut this off at the beginning.
[03:15:27.057 --> 03:15:30.418]  There are always a certain number of young people who are alienated.
[03:15:30.558 --> 03:15:34.480]  They don't get a job, they lost a girlfriend, their family doesn't feel happy here.
[03:15:34.840 --> 03:15:42.703]  And we can watch the signs of that and there are members of the community who will reach out to those people and bring them back in and encourage them to look at their blessings here.
[03:15:43.343 --> 03:15:49.286]  But I do think on a national policy level, we need to look at what self-radicalization means.
[03:15:49.406 --> 03:15:54.628]  Because we are at war with this group of terrorists.
[03:15:54.828 --> 03:15:56.009]  They do have an ideology.
[03:15:56.429 --> 03:16:04.253]  In World War II, if someone supported Nazi Germany at the expense of the United States, we didn't say that was freedom of speech.
[03:16:04.813 --> 03:16:06.694]  We put him in a camp.
[03:16:07.015 --> 03:16:08.355]  They were prisoners of war.
[03:16:09.036 --> 03:16:18.522]  So if these people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States as a matter of principle, fine, that's their right.
[03:16:18.602 --> 03:16:24.906]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the conflict.
[03:16:24.966 --> 03:16:27.968]  And I think we're going to have to increasingly get tough on this.
[03:16:27.988 --> 03:16:29.710]  Okay, and so will Europe, he goes on to say.
[03:16:30.450 --> 03:16:31.291]  Here's the problem.
[03:16:31.311 --> 03:16:37.274]  They're bringing in record numbers of Muslims from radical countries, from radical sects.
[03:16:38.355 --> 03:16:46.920]  I mean, they can look into a database, find out if somebody is a Wahhabist, like these folks were connected to.
[03:16:49.522 --> 03:16:53.905]  They can see his comments online, on Facebook.
[03:16:53.945 --> 03:16:57.607]  I mean, the FBI was already watching him and was told to stand down.
[03:16:59.397 --> 03:17:01.798]  And William Benny talked about the NSA had the power to stop 9-11.
[03:17:01.878 --> 03:17:04.179]  We weren't allowed to use those tools.
[03:17:04.819 --> 03:17:16.963]  Instead, everybody gets spied on because the political class wants these threats to be there, wants to keep them going, as William Benny has said, to take more of our liberties so they can dominate the general political mass of the people who are not criminals.
[03:17:20.164 --> 03:17:24.646]  Joining us is William Benny, former technical director of the National Security Agency.
[03:17:25.046 --> 03:17:26.566]  I don't know where you want to start, sir.
[03:17:27.046 --> 03:17:28.427]  We could get into
[03:17:29.690 --> 03:17:32.912]  The latest hacking situation with Ashley Madison.
[03:17:32.932 --> 03:17:35.995]  We could get into corporation spying.
[03:17:36.015 --> 03:17:37.456]  We could get into exposed facts.
[03:17:38.136 --> 03:17:39.517]  The site that has your info posted.
[03:17:39.537 --> 03:17:42.200]  The tour you just came off of speaking around the world.
[03:17:42.760 --> 03:17:46.683]  We could get into this call for interning Islamists that are radicalized.
[03:17:47.904 --> 03:17:49.065]  What do you want to tackle first, sir?
[03:17:51.501 --> 03:17:57.925]  Well, it's good to be with you again, Alex, but could we start with the OPM issue and the data hacking?
[03:17:57.985 --> 03:17:59.165]  Absolutely.
[03:17:59.206 --> 03:18:06.730]  Let's talk about the data hacking and more time in the spotlight for NSL 2014 and review this big court ruling.
[03:18:07.591 --> 03:18:09.272]  Yeah.
[03:18:10.753 --> 03:18:19.919]  First of all, with the OPM, when they lose all of that data, that includes things like when you go for a clearance with the government to work for the government,
[03:18:20.450 --> 03:18:45.381]  You fill out a form that's an SF-86, a standard form 86, and that goes through your entire history, work history, health issues, your family, all your family members, all their names, addresses, phone numbers, and references, all the people you have done as references, plus it also authorizes them to
[03:18:46.768 --> 03:18:56.955]  You have to authorize them to be able to acquire any kind of information health-wise, financially, or anything else that the FBI wishes to get.
[03:18:57.055 --> 03:19:01.458]  It's like a universal NSL on every individual that applied.
[03:19:01.778 --> 03:19:04.159]  So all of that goes into the files in OPM.
[03:19:05.520 --> 03:19:16.103]  And so in layman's terms, the reported Chinese hack that Obama's covering up is basically the secret files on federal employees, operatives, and others.
[03:19:16.503 --> 03:19:17.563]  An unprecedented breach.
[03:19:17.943 --> 03:19:18.923]  Who do you think's behind it?
[03:19:18.943 --> 03:19:19.943]  They're saying it's China.
[03:19:21.184 --> 03:19:22.884]  Mr. Binney, you're the expert on this.
[03:19:23.204 --> 03:19:24.225]  Who do you think's really behind it?
[03:19:25.185 --> 03:19:27.665]  Well, I think they're probably right that it is China.
[03:19:28.746 --> 03:19:30.446]  I think that's probably what it is, yeah.
[03:19:31.747 --> 03:19:34.188]  But there's something other than that.
[03:19:34.228 --> 03:19:36.809]  There's something even more threatening here.
[03:19:36.989 --> 03:19:40.811]  That is, I'm not sure what OPM had exactly in their files.
[03:19:40.851 --> 03:19:47.093]  But if they had all of the... They're supposed to compile all the data of your experience while you're working with the government.
[03:19:47.113 --> 03:19:50.034]  So it's like your central personnel file.
[03:19:50.235 --> 03:19:52.415]  Which will have a lot of intel on who's been investigated.
[03:19:52.455 --> 03:19:53.736]  This is a devastating breach.
[03:19:53.956 --> 03:19:54.156]  Yeah.
[03:19:54.797 --> 03:20:17.638]  And it would also list, for example, letters of appreciation or commendation or awards and things like that, which for your work history, that if you achieve things in work, then they would write them up and you would get a letter or some kind of award, achievement award or something like that, which would go into describing what you did.
[03:20:18.553 --> 03:20:19.993]  So it would be classified.
[03:20:20.053 --> 03:20:24.955]  So now if that classified data is in there, also that means the Chinese have all of that, too.
[03:20:25.255 --> 03:20:28.636]  Well, Mr. Benny, this is so bombshell, and I knew it was in the notes to go over.
[03:20:29.256 --> 03:20:31.557]  I'd like you to start over without me interrupting.
[03:20:31.957 --> 03:20:38.799]  Explain the data breach that happened, the clear hacks that have been going on, the glitches all over the place, the war between the U.S.
[03:20:38.859 --> 03:20:39.359]  and China.
[03:20:39.899 --> 03:20:46.581]  And then I want to go back into the last time you were in studio with us, and we're going to put this together with that on the nightly news tonight.
[03:20:47.401 --> 03:21:04.232]  Well, you explained by putting everything on digital databases and by putting back doors and everything, it made our country wide open to foreign hacking and is the ultimate tool, Trojan horse, to make us absolutely Swiss cheese penetrable.
[03:21:04.593 --> 03:21:09.296]  That has now, within a month or two of you predicting it, has now happened.
[03:21:09.356 --> 03:21:17.141]  So explain it to us like we're just the lay public and not 200 IQ super geniuses, you know, top code breakers like yourself.
[03:21:18.962 --> 03:21:23.986]  Okay, let me see if I can put it simply.
[03:21:25.067 --> 03:21:36.775]  If, for example, you have a bunch of protected information that you have classified or information about the people who are working for you, you're assembling it in a database so you can help manage your business.
[03:21:37.215 --> 03:21:39.137]  Okay, the industry would do this too.
[03:21:39.833 --> 03:21:45.637]  So, but if you put it in a database, you have to try to ensure that that database is secure.
[03:21:46.158 --> 03:22:06.653]  Well, if NSA is going along and other intelligence agencies around the world are going along trying to find weaknesses in operating systems or firewalls or other kinds of encryption or things like that, and when they find them, they don't tell anybody so that what they can do, it gives them a window into everything that they are doing.
[03:22:07.546 --> 03:22:14.992]  That simply says they're allowing a flaw in the system to exist and continue, which can be discovered by anybody in the world.
[03:22:15.113 --> 03:22:18.035]  I mean, they have no monopoly on smart people.
[03:22:18.055 --> 03:22:28.324]  There's lots of smart people all around the world, so that means that they eventually have a chance to get in and see that too, which means that that then makes everybody with that system vulnerable.
[03:22:30.025 --> 03:22:32.968]  So they leave the holes, they don't patch them, please continue.
[03:22:33.823 --> 03:22:38.205]  Yeah, they leave them that way because they want to be able to look into what you're doing.
[03:22:38.585 --> 03:22:42.166]  So that they know they have a window in, but other people can discover that too.
[03:22:42.726 --> 03:22:50.749]  And when the other people do it, like the Chinese, for example, that means that they can come across and take everything that's in those files also.
[03:22:53.032 --> 03:23:06.198]  So now it's safe to say the entire 21 million huge government database of operatives and spies and hackers, you name it, has now been grabbed by the Communist Chinese.
[03:23:07.368 --> 03:23:18.477]  Plus, potentially some of the awards that they've all achieved over their work history, which means it may outline some of the programs that are existing and some of the techniques that were used to achieve the success.
[03:23:18.537 --> 03:23:20.118]  But almost no coverage of this.
[03:23:20.178 --> 03:23:24.742]  We've heard Snowden's the biggest demon in the world for exposing illegal spying on the people.
[03:23:25.162 --> 03:23:28.985]  Right, and it also outlines all the contractors that are involved with the NSA or CIA or anybody else.
[03:23:48.198 --> 03:24:03.190]  And it gives them, like for example, that's how the Chinese came up with the design of the F-35, you know, that's the same design as ours, but they got it from us, they didn't get it from, you know, from having to do the development themselves.
[03:24:03.751 --> 03:24:06.773]  They don't have to spend $400 million now, they can just take it for free.
[03:24:07.474 --> 03:24:16.501]  Yeah, they take it from the contractors, yeah, who are, you know, the weaknesses then are system-wide, all the contractors that are involved also have to be protected in the same level, and they're not.
[03:24:17.122 --> 03:24:19.705]  And that's why they're being able to get into these systems.
[03:24:21.126 --> 03:24:23.208]  So, I mean, it makes everybody vulnerable.
[03:24:23.308 --> 03:24:37.963]  Why are we seeing prosecution of journalists that expose the crime, but then they let the communist Chinese operatives also work in these secret facilities as well, who are then physically, as a brain trust, taking the plans out of the building?
[03:24:40.085 --> 03:24:41.046]  You know, it's beyond me.
[03:24:41.146 --> 03:24:42.666]  I can't understand this myself.
[03:24:42.766 --> 03:24:43.427]  I really can't.
[03:24:43.567 --> 03:24:45.568]  I mean, it's absolutely astounding.
[03:24:45.628 --> 03:24:46.608]  How can people do this?
[03:24:46.728 --> 03:24:47.748]  I just don't understand it.
[03:24:48.389 --> 03:24:51.430]  I mean, if whistleblowers come out and show that there's a problem...
[03:24:52.296 --> 03:24:57.240]  Or an issue or something illegal or something, you know, criminal or some fraud or waste.
[03:24:57.820 --> 03:24:58.120]  Why?
[03:24:58.261 --> 03:25:03.505]  I mean, it would be in the vested interest of the organization, the government, or the industry to address that issue.
[03:25:03.965 --> 03:25:12.812]  If they want to improve as a corporation or a government, they should address it to fix the problem instead of letting the problem fester and continue.
[03:25:13.212 --> 03:25:17.135]  Because it only allows, you know, all of these follow-on things to happen.
[03:25:18.120 --> 03:25:26.282]  So, you know, it's almost infallible to me as to how they would, you know, just let this continue like that.
[03:25:27.362 --> 03:25:31.403]  It shows a really decadent attitude and a laissez-faire attitude by these people.
[03:25:32.703 --> 03:25:35.604]  This smells like an empire on the verge of collapse to me.
[03:25:35.664 --> 03:25:40.485]  Just all of this craziness going on really, really stinks to high heaven.
[03:25:41.505 --> 03:25:42.625]  Yeah, it certainly does, yeah.
[03:25:43.346 --> 03:25:44.706]  I absolutely agree to that.
[03:25:45.899 --> 03:25:47.500]  Well, I've asked some of the questions here.
[03:25:47.980 --> 03:25:49.722]  You brought up these huge data breaches.
[03:25:50.902 --> 03:25:53.484]  Then that ties into, as you said, commercial outfits.
[03:25:53.944 --> 03:25:59.768]  Everything from Amazon to Bank of America to Ashley Madison with 37 million cheaters on it.
[03:26:00.249 --> 03:26:05.512]  Now they're saying they're going to publish that in a database so men and women can find out if their husband or wife cheated on them.
[03:26:05.912 --> 03:26:12.377]  I mean, it just seems like all this open source, open code, backdoor open stuff is going to bring down the world.
[03:26:14.116 --> 03:26:24.880]  It certainly makes the world vulnerable to all kinds of manipulation and monitoring and all kinds of blackmail or things like that happening anywhere in the world for anybody.
[03:26:26.541 --> 03:26:32.903]  It's not just the average citizen, but it's also members of parliaments around the world, government officials, everybody.
[03:26:34.383 --> 03:26:35.824]  What about planted info?
[03:26:35.844 --> 03:26:41.089]  I know I've seen a lot of cases where different agencies in this government and others plant stuff on people's computers.
[03:26:41.729 --> 03:26:45.132]  Isn't it easy for them to go in and plant stuff with these back doors?
[03:26:46.473 --> 03:26:48.095]  Yeah, you see, that's part of the problem.
[03:26:48.135 --> 03:26:50.457]  That makes that all possible too.
[03:26:51.726 --> 03:26:55.910]  And that means that, you know, it gets back to a question of trust.
[03:26:55.970 --> 03:26:59.472]  How can you trust a government that has the capability to do that?
[03:26:59.672 --> 03:27:03.195]  And if they do everything in secret, you never know what they're doing.
[03:27:03.716 --> 03:27:07.358]  And so it's very difficult to prove one way or another that they did or didn't do that.
[03:27:08.599 --> 03:27:14.604]  The way we did it, of course, was to have duplicate copies of everything we ever did in multiple places.
[03:27:14.664 --> 03:27:17.226]  So you're backed up so that if they manipulate anything,
[03:27:18.287 --> 03:27:21.590]  Then we could show it from a record copy from another source that we had.
[03:27:22.070 --> 03:27:23.351]  Weren't you able to do that yourself?
[03:27:23.371 --> 03:27:26.754]  Didn't they try to set you up, but you, somebody inside warned you?
[03:27:28.335 --> 03:27:42.687]  Well, we didn't have any, it was basically we understood how these people operated, so we did the backups like I just said, and so that when they took data and tried to accuse us of something, we already had retrieved all the data from our backup sources.
[03:27:43.761 --> 03:27:56.294]  And so they couldn't claim things that didn't exist in our backup sources, so we could show in court record copy, you know, emails, things like that, that would demonstrate that what they were saying was untrue.
[03:27:57.475 --> 03:28:06.324]  I'm going from memory, last time you were physically here, there was some other facet to it though, where someone inside basically stopped them from being able to set you up.
[03:28:06.344 --> 03:28:07.405]  You don't know who they are though?
[03:28:08.340 --> 03:28:26.401]  Oh, in the Department of Justice, somebody felt really bad about what they were doing to us, so they sent us a copy of their draft indictment, which showed all of the falsehoods that they were attempting to claim against us.
[03:28:28.359 --> 03:28:31.180]  So there was somebody in the DOJ who actually felt bad about it.
[03:28:31.260 --> 03:28:35.341]  So, you know, not everybody there is bad, is what I'm trying to say.
[03:28:35.381 --> 03:28:35.661]  Sure.
[03:28:36.422 --> 03:28:49.466]  Being in government for decades, being admittedly one of the top code breakers ever, moving up from the mailroom to the very top of the organization, basically, to use that allegory or that analogy,
[03:28:50.950 --> 03:28:52.891]  And we're going to break here in a moment, just a quick question.
[03:28:53.631 --> 03:28:58.574]  What percentage, as a guesstimation of government, would you say are good guys versus bad guys?
[03:29:00.635 --> 03:29:16.643]  I think that the corruption of people and the conversion to the dark side starts around grade 15, which is probably, which is the government service grade, which is like a lieutenant or a bird colonel in the military.
[03:29:17.535 --> 03:29:20.358]  At that level on up is where the corruption really starts.
[03:29:20.938 --> 03:29:26.603]  And so at that point, I'd say you're talking maybe about 15% of the people.
[03:29:27.604 --> 03:29:30.427]  And it runs basically on a military system, you're just in plain clothes.
[03:29:30.467 --> 03:29:32.088]  In fact, you were a, what level were you?
[03:29:32.168 --> 03:29:33.549]  A general?
[03:29:35.091 --> 03:29:38.614]  I was like, it's not quite equivalent to military, but it's like a 1.5 general.
[03:29:38.654 --> 03:29:38.794]  Yeah.
[03:29:38.814 --> 03:29:39.255]  Star General.
[03:29:39.375 --> 03:29:39.495]  Yeah.
[03:29:41.380 --> 03:29:42.181]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:42.241 --> 03:29:42.682]  Stay there.
[03:29:42.722 --> 03:29:47.407]  William Benny, former technical director of the NSA, is our guest.
[03:29:47.487 --> 03:29:48.248]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:29:48.288 --> 03:29:48.949]  Stay with us.
[03:29:50.370 --> 03:29:51.251]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.772 --> 03:29:53.354]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.295 --> 03:29:56.978]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.841 --> 03:30:06.583]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now.
[03:30:07.344 --> 03:30:12.186]  And if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation, well I'll tell you how.
[03:30:12.726 --> 03:30:18.229]  When the Democrats showed their true colors, you got angry and you elected Republicans.
[03:30:18.749 --> 03:30:23.992]  And then when the Republicans showed their true colors, you got angry and elected Democrats.
[03:30:24.432 --> 03:30:34.518]  And when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best interest, you acted like they were crazy.
[03:30:35.098 --> 03:30:42.803]  But the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
[03:30:43.303 --> 03:30:49.212]  That's why it is vitally important that you wake up, America, and break the matrix.
[03:30:49.593 --> 03:30:54.520]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Show.
[03:30:54.981 --> 03:30:57.364]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:31:00.581 --> 03:31:04.385]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[03:31:04.666 --> 03:31:14.977]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[03:31:15.137 --> 03:31:18.060]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[03:31:18.200 --> 03:31:26.962]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[03:31:27.002 --> 03:31:28.763]  This is the good halogen.
[03:31:28.843 --> 03:31:31.603]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[03:31:31.904 --> 03:31:43.687]  Now we at InfoWarsLife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure, 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.

[03:33:13.698 --> 03:33:19.722]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:28.934 --> 03:33:38.660]  Please never forget InfoWars.com, the syndicated radio broadcast, the TV transmission, the nightly news, all of it is funded by viewers and listeners like you.
[03:33:39.681 --> 03:33:47.146]  Now we have a free video and audio feed of the TV slash radio show at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:33:48.769 --> 03:33:58.318]  And that cost us, in bandwidth, the millions of people that tune in every month, just the free audio streams and the video streams, more than $20,000.
[03:33:59.599 --> 03:34:01.480]  That's with bandwidth going down in price.
[03:34:02.401 --> 03:34:07.886]  That's why we have subscription for the Nightly News, which is $5.95 a month.
[03:34:07.906 --> 03:34:08.587]  20 people can use it.
[03:34:11.349 --> 03:34:20.156]  That money helps pay for the bandwidth to then put out the daytime show for free for folks that don't have AM and FM stations in their area.
[03:34:21.578 --> 03:34:25.181]  That's why I want to thank all of you that are PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[03:34:26.081 --> 03:34:27.643]  Now I've signed the satellite deals.
[03:34:29.640 --> 03:34:31.502]  I have paid for the closed captioning.
[03:34:32.222 --> 03:34:32.843]  It's all set.
[03:34:32.883 --> 03:34:41.329]  I'm not going to announce when, but the next few months, we are going to launch on the major satellites, and it'll be on quite a few cable and broadcast TV stations.
[03:34:41.729 --> 03:34:44.191]  We've already got more than 15 lined up, ready to turn it on.
[03:34:44.531 --> 03:34:46.493]  Some are already downloading it every day and playing it.
[03:34:46.913 --> 03:34:52.517]  And some of them are big, like in Houston, on basic cable we're on, to millions of customers.
[03:34:53.638 --> 03:34:55.800]  And I'm going to be listing those stations, thanking them.
[03:34:56.460 --> 03:34:57.941]  We're really in the establishment's face.
[03:34:59.480 --> 03:35:01.561]  It is the PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[03:35:02.001 --> 03:35:08.964]  Those of you that get to see all the films, get to see the shows first, get your direct access to the 20 years of work.
[03:35:09.444 --> 03:35:16.767]  When you are a PrisonPlanet.tv member, you're helping finance and pay to get the word out to the general public that doesn't know what's happening.
[03:35:18.608 --> 03:35:23.050]  So you can hear guests like Ron Paul and William Benny and so many others here on the broadcast.
[03:35:23.210 --> 03:35:25.451]  So I want to thank all of you out there
[03:35:27.318 --> 03:35:34.580]  For your support, if you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, we're fighting the creation of a prison planet in the InfoWar.
[03:35:35.080 --> 03:35:36.240]  Please become a member today.
[03:35:36.701 --> 03:35:42.742]  If you are a member and aren't sharing your username with friends and family so they can tune in and watch, please do.
[03:35:45.463 --> 03:35:51.585]  You are the individuals that have the power in this fight to alert the sleeping giant and awaken this country and the world.
[03:35:51.605 --> 03:35:52.985]  And that's beginning to happen.
[03:35:54.440 --> 03:35:57.461]  As bad as things are, there's a lot of good happening as well.
[03:35:58.021 --> 03:35:59.581]  So, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:35:59.921 --> 03:36:12.703]  We have free shipping in the month of July, which has got another 10 days or so to go, on all of the hundreds of high-quality products at InfowarsStore.com, or when you call 888-253-3139.
[03:36:12.723 --> 03:36:19.044]  25% off the Molon Malabe Made in America belt buckles.
[03:36:19.844 --> 03:36:21.265]  10% off all the Patriot apparel.
[03:36:21.545 --> 03:36:22.505]  T-shirts, you name it.
[03:36:24.306 --> 03:36:26.667]  And the profit goes to fund this operation.
[03:36:27.308 --> 03:36:33.351]  But satellites are... The amount of time we have, and believe me, we haggled $15,000 a month.
[03:36:33.691 --> 03:36:35.352]  Closed captioning $10,000 a month.
[03:36:35.792 --> 03:36:36.973]  Not to mention reporters.
[03:36:37.793 --> 03:36:41.595]  All of it cost me millions and millions and millions of dollars a year.
[03:36:42.275 --> 03:36:46.097]  It is a testament to folks voting with their dollars that we're able to pay for all this.
[03:36:46.638 --> 03:36:49.599]  We couldn't do it in LA or New York because it's so expensive there.
[03:36:49.919 --> 03:36:50.700]  We're in Texas.
[03:36:51.744 --> 03:36:58.986]  And so by the grace of God, we're now reaching 20 million people a week, conservatively, one way or another, on all our platforms.
[03:36:59.666 --> 03:37:02.627]  I want to go to 40 million a week, 100 million a week.
[03:37:03.748 --> 03:37:18.292]  And so by going to Infowarslife.com, by getting the high quality vitamins and minerals and proprietary product lines, like DNA Force, Lung Cleanse, our colloidal silver, Super Mel Vitality, Survival Shield, Nacin Iodine X2,
[03:37:19.653 --> 03:37:24.215]  That you'll find these real game-changing products and help support this transmission.
[03:37:24.576 --> 03:37:30.258]  So, InfoWarsLive.com is the subsection that has the nutraceuticals of InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:37:30.959 --> 03:37:34.241]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com and you can find everything right there.
[03:37:34.661 --> 03:37:37.482]  Okay, Mr. Benny, I've been asking some of the questions.
[03:37:37.542 --> 03:37:42.485]  Former head of technical operations at the NSA is our guest.
[03:37:43.045 --> 03:37:44.546]  If folks just joined us,
[03:37:45.913 --> 03:37:50.698]  Former Technical Leader for the Intelligence with the NSA before becoming a whistleblower in 2001 to Congress.
[03:37:52.875 --> 03:37:54.697]  He did it the proper way until he got SWAT teamed.
[03:37:55.157 --> 03:38:00.882]  After more than 30 years with the agency, Benny has been described as one of the big, best analysts and codebreakers in NSA history.
[03:38:01.322 --> 03:38:05.486]  Benny continues to speak out on the NSA's data collection, exposefacts.org.
[03:38:06.146 --> 03:38:14.834]  I've got a lot of questions to answer, to try to get you to answer, but I also want to hear what you think is important front and center.
[03:38:15.454 --> 03:38:20.579]  So, go ahead, Mr. Benny, what else should the public know about from your expert perspective?
[03:38:22.485 --> 03:38:29.833]  Well, relative to the OPM loss of data, I mean, they could have easily encrypted that data.
[03:38:29.853 --> 03:38:34.417]  It doesn't matter whether you have data stored on an old set of equipment or a new set.
[03:38:34.818 --> 03:38:37.520]  It's still stored in a database.
[03:38:38.441 --> 03:38:40.784]  You can encrypt a database no matter where it is.
[03:38:40.864 --> 03:38:43.306]  So they could have done that all along, but they didn't.
[03:38:43.907 --> 03:38:45.889]  So that even made them even more vulnerable.
[03:38:46.641 --> 03:38:51.803]  You know, so that would have been a simple solution for them to do and to help protect that information.
[03:38:51.943 --> 03:38:52.983]  And they didn't even do that.
[03:38:53.724 --> 03:38:56.284]  So, I mean, they're not making good decisions here, period.
[03:38:56.525 --> 03:39:00.466]  I mean, these are not people who are competent at securing anything.
[03:39:00.506 --> 03:39:01.986]  I mean, the same is true with NSA.
[03:39:02.026 --> 03:39:06.068]  I mean, they're doing this bulk acquisition of information and burying themselves.
[03:39:06.753 --> 03:39:17.981]  And I keep, I use the case of the Garland shooting, Garland, Texas shooting down there where, you know, a member of Anonymous tipped off the local police down there that they were going to be attacked two days before the attack occurred.
[03:39:18.541 --> 03:39:24.705]  And yet our intelligence community, for which we pay over a hundred billion dollars a year, said absolutely nothing.
[03:39:24.946 --> 03:39:25.326]  Why?
[03:39:25.446 --> 03:39:28.248]  Because they're buried in so much information they can't find it.
[03:39:28.328 --> 03:39:32.451]  Whereas Anonymous was very focused, they had a focused attack, a focused look at the
[03:39:33.248 --> 03:39:41.413]  People who were involved in terrorism or were showing signs of being radicalized, and they found the information, whereas our intelligence community didn't.
[03:39:42.173 --> 03:39:53.420]  And so they have the incompetence at the top levels of all these agencies are adopting the incorrect process for the entire agencies of the intelligence community.
[03:39:53.760 --> 03:39:58.563]  That means they're making us all more vulnerable than we've ever been before.
[03:40:00.208 --> 03:40:05.211]  So, I mean, that's so important that people don't seem to realize, well, they keep saying they're doing this for our protection.
[03:40:05.251 --> 03:40:15.077]  Well, so did the Nazis in 1933, when they, you know, took power to do anything with anybody with NDAA, Section 1021, which is Special Order 48 for the Nazis.
[03:40:15.117 --> 03:40:18.539]  The same kind of thing has occurred down through history over and over again.
[03:40:19.260 --> 03:40:25.484]  And if their objective is to protect us, then they ought to do things smartly, professionally, and with discipline.
[03:40:25.964 --> 03:40:27.485]  And that's what they're not doing.
[03:40:31.269 --> 03:40:32.710]  So what is the endgame?
[03:40:32.750 --> 03:40:54.483]  I mean obviously hundreds of billions of dollars are being made a year by private contractors and big companies, so they're always lobbying for more and more of this, but then you have giant sprawling facilities in Utah, Texas, Maryland, all over the place, not to mention 800,000 people that are outside government with security clearances, building the ultimate hackable
[03:40:55.811 --> 03:40:58.954]  Open door nightmare system.
[03:40:59.535 --> 03:41:01.777]  How do they think they're going to get away with this?
[03:41:01.877 --> 03:41:04.879]  I mean, it's going to create more and more disasters.
[03:41:04.919 --> 03:41:11.666]  Now the Chinese have stolen 21 million background dossiers on federal employees and operatives.
[03:41:12.226 --> 03:41:16.370]  I mean, this is just unprecedented and nobody's getting in trouble for it.
[03:41:18.007 --> 03:41:32.541]  Yeah, I think they feel that this is what President Eisenhower really warned us about back in 1961, was the power of the evolving, at the time, military-industrial complex, is the way he called it.
[03:41:32.881 --> 03:41:37.445]  But it's really the military-industrial-intelligence complex, which includes government.
[03:41:39.032 --> 03:41:43.316]  The supposed intelligence committees that were supposed to prevent spying on U.S.
[03:41:43.356 --> 03:41:49.741]  citizens as a result of the FISA laws back in 1978, in fact, are now advocates for spying on U.S.
[03:41:49.781 --> 03:41:50.242]  citizens.
[03:41:50.902 --> 03:41:53.845]  So that's the kind of reversal that's gone on.
[03:41:53.945 --> 03:42:06.916]  I mean, our entire government in the intelligence-related field, national security, if you will, has now felt that they're above the law, they're above the Constitution, they can do anything they feel is necessary, and nobody's going to stop them.
[03:42:07.771 --> 03:42:23.736]  And everybody's afraid to do anything, because they'll feel that if political people started doing, they would fear being labeled, you know, weak on terror, weak on national security, and they don't want that label, and so therefore they go along to get along.
[03:42:24.588 --> 03:42:25.709]  Well, take Rand Paul.
[03:42:25.849 --> 03:42:28.612]  He said four years ago, don't fund the Free Syrian Army.
[03:42:29.032 --> 03:42:31.434]  They're really Wahhabis out of Saudi Arabia.
[03:42:32.215 --> 03:42:45.847]  And then now, they go on the news and say, because you're not for the Patriot Act extension, or illegal NSA spying, it's going to be your fault when we get hit by terrorists, when they have this giant NSA system, and it didn't stop anything.
[03:42:46.787 --> 03:42:47.668]  That's exactly right.
[03:42:47.728 --> 03:42:50.611]  And that's because they're not doing a professional, disciplined approach.
[03:42:51.252 --> 03:42:59.895]  The management is directing something that is focused on getting more money and more money and building a bigger bureaucracy and not actually solving problems.
[03:43:01.355 --> 03:43:07.437]  That's the way they've approached this entire problem from the beginning, even before 9-11.
[03:43:08.218 --> 03:43:17.161]  I mean, it was basically they allowed things to happen without actually trying to stop them and doing smart things to make that happen, make that possible.
[03:43:18.982 --> 03:43:21.664]  They just were looking for money as the main objective.
[03:43:22.645 --> 03:43:23.666]  Well, we know what's going to happen.
[03:43:23.706 --> 03:43:32.693]  The Chinese are going to use that database to make connections between the people that are on the list and operatives inside their country.
[03:43:32.713 --> 03:43:37.236]  And they're undoubtedly going to end up imprisoning or killing U.S.
[03:43:37.336 --> 03:43:41.360]  operatives inside China and rolling up the entire Western operation.
[03:43:42.495 --> 03:43:47.399]  And it only seems like it's a matter of time before this confrontation with China escalates.
[03:43:47.800 --> 03:43:50.322]  But so many of our leaders are heavily invested in China.
[03:43:50.682 --> 03:43:52.724]  They're basically already double agents to China.
[03:43:52.744 --> 03:43:55.026]  I mean, this just seems like a recipe for disaster.
[03:43:56.687 --> 03:43:57.568]  I couldn't agree more.
[03:43:57.628 --> 03:44:01.691]  I mean, we're not doing anything smart in most international arenas.
[03:44:03.032 --> 03:44:08.277]  I mean, it's just not it's just not smart to do the taking the and doing the procedures that we're doing, even like with the
[03:44:09.429 --> 03:44:13.994]  I don't understand why we didn't put more pressure on the Iranians to get a better deal.
[03:44:14.074 --> 03:44:15.916]  I mean, why didn't we ask for a better deal?
[03:44:16.237 --> 03:44:18.800]  It seemed like we caved on every point that they were asking on.
[03:44:19.460 --> 03:44:21.503]  You know, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me to do that.
[03:44:23.660 --> 03:44:25.701]  You know, usually I can figure out what's going on.
[03:44:25.721 --> 03:44:27.721]  I can't figure out what's going on with Iran.
[03:44:28.801 --> 03:44:37.304]  Because the West is clearly funding Iran's archenemy, Saudi Arabia, and allowing them to run a Sunni takeover.
[03:44:38.304 --> 03:44:41.665]  And then meanwhile, we've been fighting a proxy war against Iran in Syria.
[03:44:42.125 --> 03:44:48.327]  But then on the other hand, we make a one-sided deal that is for Iran, and then they make fun of us.
[03:44:49.627 --> 03:44:51.708]  I mean, I can't figure out what's going on.
[03:44:53.177 --> 03:44:56.180]  Yeah, it's hard to follow the bouncing ball in that arena.
[03:44:56.821 --> 03:44:59.284]  That's for sure.
[03:44:59.664 --> 03:45:01.266]  I really don't know what to say myself.
[03:45:01.286 --> 03:45:04.410]  I don't know how to characterize that.
[03:45:06.078 --> 03:45:22.053]  Meanwhile, for those that just joined us, you got SWAT teamed for going and whistleblowing to Congress, and they tried to put you and others in prison, so that's who this government's focused on, is people like you that built so much of what they're misusing today.
[03:45:22.333 --> 03:45:26.097]  So I guess, honorable service to the Republic, that's legal and lawful, is punished.
[03:45:26.617 --> 03:45:29.460]  Being an absolute whore trader is rewarded.
[03:45:32.185 --> 03:45:43.996]  Yeah, I think I refer to that as population control, which is the objective of mass acquisition of data on everybody in your country, or on the planet.
[03:45:44.797 --> 03:45:46.298]  It's really population control.
[03:45:47.860 --> 03:45:49.641]  So that's really what they're after, I think.
[03:45:51.303 --> 03:45:54.706]  That way they get to manipulate anybody they want to do anything they want them to do.
[03:45:57.577 --> 03:46:04.620]  And then they just hope that other governments and corporations are too incompetent to know how to use the data that they can get as well.
[03:46:04.680 --> 03:46:05.781]  That just sounds arrogant.
[03:46:07.062 --> 03:46:18.827]  Well, so far it's been pretty much true, except that there's like some of the cases when they have these break-ins and theft of information, why that shows that others are starting to wise up too.
[03:46:20.248 --> 03:46:21.349]  So, I mean, it means that
[03:46:23.500 --> 03:46:30.053]  It simply means that they can't guarantee that they will be the only ones to be able to leverage this information.
[03:46:33.336 --> 03:46:34.597]  Well take Ashley Madison.
[03:46:35.217 --> 03:46:42.623]  From the time I heard that being promoted on talk radio by Howard Stern and people, I just immediately thought that sounds like a recipe for blackmail.
[03:46:43.224 --> 03:46:49.129]  And then now 37 million people that have reportedly cheated on their spouses, that database has now been stolen.
[03:46:49.489 --> 03:46:54.333]  Why would anyone, if they were going to cheat on their spouse, go do it on a mass database?
[03:46:56.280 --> 03:47:15.400]  Yeah, that's really kind of...it's really...people don't realize what's possible today and, you know, with the information systems we have, they just don't realize that this information is out there forever for just about anybody to get to it if they know how to do that.
[03:47:17.912 --> 03:47:26.778]  William Binney, former technical director of the National Security Agency, is our guest, and we're here going over some of the latest developments.
[03:47:27.319 --> 03:47:39.067]  What do you make of a whole bunch of financial websites, the Wall Street Journal, airlines going down two weeks ago, the New York Stock Exchange going down, and they said it was not connected to a hack.
[03:47:40.588 --> 03:47:42.149]  Do you have any info on that, Mr. Binney?
[03:47:43.463 --> 03:47:54.971]  I don't have any first-hand knowledge of that, but it sure sounds suspicious, even by simply a time coincidence, that those things are happening without some central or coordinated action.
[03:47:54.991 --> 03:48:01.035]  You have to try to figure the random probability of that actually being that way.
[03:48:01.055 --> 03:48:06.759]  The random probability is pretty low, in my view, anyway.
[03:48:07.620 --> 03:48:09.341]  Since you were last on, Clapper,
[03:48:11.854 --> 03:48:20.160]  Of course, for folks who don't know, who headed up the NSA, his lawyer came out and said that he was forgetful.
[03:48:20.801 --> 03:48:23.603]  He didn't mean to lie, saying the NSA does no domestic spying.
[03:48:23.943 --> 03:48:25.084]  He was just forgetful.
[03:48:25.404 --> 03:48:26.164]  What do you make of that?
[03:48:26.184 --> 03:48:30.348]  I think that's just a bunch of hard wash.
[03:48:30.748 --> 03:48:34.931]  I mean, he was given those questions, you know, two days in advance.
[03:48:36.075 --> 03:48:44.024]  So how can you be forgetful when you're given the questions you're going to be asked in committee and you go over them?
[03:48:44.104 --> 03:48:45.726]  How can you forget that you went over them?
[03:48:45.786 --> 03:48:47.769]  I mean, that's just a bunch of malarkey.
[03:48:48.174 --> 03:48:50.015]  Well, we see how the Supreme Court's acting.
[03:48:50.035 --> 03:48:53.377]  We see how Congress is acting, doing whatever foreign corporations want.
[03:48:53.818 --> 03:48:55.258]  We've been conquered with blackmail.
[03:48:55.298 --> 03:48:55.999]  I think it's clear.
[03:48:56.699 --> 03:49:01.262]  It's come out that the British Parliament's being blackmailed with their MI6 spying.
[03:49:01.682 --> 03:49:05.745]  It's come out the CIA is spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[03:49:05.765 --> 03:49:09.967]  I mean, I think it's pretty clear we've been hoisted on our own petard.
[03:49:10.448 --> 03:49:15.391]  We've been hung in our own rope, and that this technology's been used to overthrow the country.
[03:49:17.896 --> 03:49:20.358]  I don't have a, I can't argue with that.
[03:49:20.398 --> 03:49:22.680]  That sounds very much on the mark to me.
[03:49:24.741 --> 03:49:28.884]  In your gut, do you think we're going to be able to reverse this or get it under control?
[03:49:30.465 --> 03:49:38.430]  Yeah, I really do because one of the basic, the fundamental thing that they're most afraid of is being exposed.
[03:49:39.370 --> 03:49:41.332]  I mean, that's why I think there's a lot of
[03:49:42.421 --> 03:49:51.203]  There's a lot of people who talk directly about issues, create a real firestorm and are opposed by any number of people.
[03:49:51.563 --> 03:49:54.403]  That's because nobody wants to address the real hard problems.
[03:49:56.324 --> 03:50:00.185]  And when it comes to it, they try to cover up things that they're doing.
[03:50:00.265 --> 03:50:06.466]  So they're very sensitive to having sunlight put on the events or the things that they've actually done.
[03:50:07.555 --> 03:50:12.316]  And some of that is coming out and even being more discussed in Europe now.
[03:50:12.356 --> 03:50:25.160]  For example, the Bundestag is finding out that the BND had agreements with certain limited numbers of members of the higher-level members of their government to do certain things with NSA that the rest of the Bundestag didn't know about.
[03:50:25.200 --> 03:50:26.761]  Well, the same was true in our Congress.
[03:50:27.161 --> 03:50:30.402]  You see, we exported that technique of how to co-opt in
[03:50:31.292 --> 03:50:34.594]  Uh, uh, legislative areas around the world.
[03:50:34.934 --> 03:50:39.597]  How to give data to select people and then make them even more prominent because they're operatives.
[03:50:39.697 --> 03:50:41.138]  It's, it's, it's espionage.
[03:50:41.819 --> 03:50:43.199]  Let's come back and talk about that.
[03:50:43.219 --> 03:50:47.182]  When Merkel claimed a year ago she didn't know about NSA spying, and of course she did.
[03:50:47.622 --> 03:50:55.127]  William Benny's been over to Europe, he's been speaking to these parliaments, and we'll find out about his recent travels, and then take a few of your phone calls.

[03:54:32.166 --> 03:54:39.590]  The story just broke on InfoWars.com.
[03:54:40.691 --> 03:54:44.873]  Black rebel flag supporter dies after being ran off the road, witnesses say.
[03:54:46.482 --> 03:54:48.303]  That story's up on InfoWars.com.

[03:54:53.788 --> 03:54:57.390]  William Benny is our guest with us 15 minutes to the next hour.
[03:54:57.410 --> 03:54:59.772]  We're going to talk to Steve, Chris, Eugene and others.
[03:55:00.312 --> 03:55:04.636]  Quick questions or comments for our guest, one of the top NSA experts out there, 800-259-9231.
[03:55:10.236 --> 03:55:13.837]  But yeah, you've been out of the country and traveling the last few months, Mr. Benny.
[03:55:14.597 --> 03:55:20.159]  Tell us about the progress you're making alerting the world to what's happening, because whether it's here in the U.S.
[03:55:20.199 --> 03:55:23.900]  or Germany or anywhere, there are laws against this.
[03:55:24.220 --> 03:55:27.481]  This is not legal by any stretch of the imagination.
[03:55:27.902 --> 03:55:29.222]  So how are they getting away with it?
[03:55:30.886 --> 03:55:38.268]  Well, that's what I've been suggesting when I go to, like, for example, Germany or Europe, anywhere in Europe.
[03:55:38.348 --> 03:55:45.509]  I mean, the European Union has laws against data transfer without the permission of the individuals involved.
[03:55:45.569 --> 03:55:55.591]  I mean, they view information, even if it's held by telecoms or any kind of service provider, that it's still, that information is the property of the individual.
[03:55:56.508 --> 03:56:03.833]  And so if they want to transfer it somewhere, give it to somebody else, or share it, then they have to get the permission of that individual to do that.
[03:56:03.873 --> 03:56:05.294]  Otherwise, it's against their laws.
[03:56:06.775 --> 03:56:20.283]  So what that really means to me, and what I keep suggesting over there, is that they should file lawsuits and criminal prosecution against all these people for sharing the information, all of the companies at least, if they don't want to do it against the U.S.
[03:56:20.323 --> 03:56:24.846]  government, then they should do it against the companies that are participating in this data sharing.
[03:56:26.026 --> 03:56:31.248]  Specifically with the PRISM program or any other of the tapping programs.
[03:56:31.308 --> 03:56:45.292]  Even the Bundestag has found out, I believe that just recently, that the BND was cooperating with NSA and sharing data about German citizens and other European citizens as well with the NSA.
[03:56:45.352 --> 03:56:47.613]  So, I mean, that's also against their laws.
[03:56:48.113 --> 03:56:55.235]  So, I mean, they have ample opportunity, if they want to, to charge these organizations with criminal prosecution.
[03:56:57.088 --> 03:56:58.790]  I mean, they just need to start doing it.
[03:57:01.332 --> 03:57:02.733]  Or, what comes next?
[03:57:02.753 --> 03:57:09.099]  I mean, if we don't reverse this big brother on steroids move, where does it end?
[03:57:09.159 --> 03:57:16.766]  I mean, you know, Samsung six months ago, with all its new customers that buy their new TVs, tells you, we watch and listen to you and sell the data.
[03:57:17.427 --> 03:57:21.731]  I mean, not just watch your patterns of what you view, to sell a...
[03:57:24.808 --> 03:57:33.131]  I know, it's insane.
[03:57:33.191 --> 03:57:35.631]  I mean, why would anybody want to buy a product like that?
[03:57:35.891 --> 03:57:36.952]  I mean, I certainly wouldn't.
[03:57:38.152 --> 03:57:46.094]  I mean, it's like that case when a school gave laptop computers to the kids to take home.
[03:57:46.914 --> 03:57:50.015]  Yeah, and they started spying on them when they were at home.
[03:57:50.155 --> 03:57:54.176]  I mean, that's certainly a violation of their privacy rights.
[03:57:54.916 --> 03:57:58.977]  Exactly, and it was the school themselves that announced it like it was a good thing.
[03:57:58.997 --> 03:58:04.778]  You know, Mr. Benny, it's almost like a revolution of these crazy control freaks against the rest of us.
[03:58:05.038 --> 03:58:08.139]  They're just doing it like it's their religion, no matter how crazy.
[03:58:08.219 --> 03:58:08.699]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:58:09.557 --> 03:58:10.997]  No, no, that's absolutely right.
[03:58:11.017 --> 03:58:12.238]  I agree totally with that.
[03:58:12.298 --> 03:58:15.419]  I mean, it's a matter of standing up for your rights.
[03:58:15.439 --> 03:58:22.880]  I mean, I've never, I have never known Americans not to stand up for their rights until this current cycle with the terrorism.
[03:58:22.941 --> 03:58:32.303]  I mean, and what they've done is they fear-mongered us into thinking that, oh, we're all in so much danger, we better just forget about our rights and let them do anything they want to try to protect us.
[03:58:32.683 --> 03:58:34.744]  Well, they aren't really trying to protect us.
[03:58:34.824 --> 03:58:37.546]  If they were, they wouldn't be doing this bulk acquisition.
[03:58:37.586 --> 03:58:39.887]  They'd be doing the targeted... Exactly.
[03:58:39.967 --> 03:58:41.268]  Stay there and explain that in 70 seconds.
[03:58:41.308 --> 03:58:42.768]  When we come back, we'll take phone calls.
[03:58:43.129 --> 03:58:44.789]  Two more segments with William Benning.
[03:58:44.950 --> 03:58:45.310]  Stay with us.
[03:58:50.814 --> 03:58:51.715]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[03:58:51.775 --> 03:58:52.175]  Good, brother.
[03:58:52.335 --> 03:58:54.056]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:58:54.296 --> 03:58:55.837]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:58:55.997 --> 03:59:00.020]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:59:00.040 --> 03:59:02.621]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[03:59:02.661 --> 03:59:04.883]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:59:05.083 --> 03:59:13.068]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:59:13.268 --> 03:59:16.352]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[03:59:16.492 --> 03:59:17.994]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[03:59:18.034 --> 03:59:22.439]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[03:59:22.719 --> 03:59:28.146]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[03:59:28.166 --> 03:59:29.587]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
