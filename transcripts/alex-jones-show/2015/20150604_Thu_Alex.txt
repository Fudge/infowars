[00:00:01.745 --> 00:00:04.364]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.794]  This is Rob Dew from Infowars.com with a special Bilderberg 2015 report.
[00:00:17.274 --> 00:00:21.097]  Now next week myself, Josh Owens, will be traveling to Austria.
[00:00:21.137 --> 00:00:22.998]  We'll be meeting Paul Joseph Watson there.
[00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:29.223]  And we will be in the Tyrol region, which is a state of Austria, sort of in the eastern mountain region.
[00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:33.646]  A lot of ski resorts there, a lot of tourism, but a lot of small towns.
[00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:39.911]  And the hotel, the Interhaupen Hotel, where the 2015 Bilderberg will be taking place, is very secluded.
[00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:45.172]  We're gonna put a map version up and you can see it's surrounded by trees and forests.
[00:00:45.632 --> 00:00:49.833]  There's a golf course nearby, but then nothing else for about 15 minutes.
[00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:58.295]  So it is definitely isolated and there's a lot of security going on ramping up for this and there's a lot being written about that, but not in the American press.
[00:00:58.335 --> 00:00:59.695]  It's mostly in the foreign press.
[00:00:59.715 --> 00:01:01.595]  I actually had to find these articles.
[00:01:01.635 --> 00:01:03.536]  They're from Austrian websites and
[00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:17.132]  German websites, even an RT international website, and I had to translate them using Google Chrome, so some of these quotes that I'll be reading from might not be in the most perfect English, but we'll just go ahead and run through those.
[00:01:17.192 --> 00:01:20.355]  But before I get to those articles, I just want to let you know we will be providing
[00:01:20.916 --> 00:01:23.318]  Total coverage while we were at Bilderberg 2015.
[00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.421]  Both Josh and myself are pretty good editors and cameramen.
[00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:32.005]  Plus we'll have Paul Joseph Watson there providing some of the best intel and using his contacts.
[00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:35.828]  So I think we're going to be giving you a really complete picture of what's going on.
[00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:41.152]  There's going to be several protests in the towns surrounding the Interhalpen Hotel.
[00:01:41.652 --> 00:01:43.153]  And we're going to be covering those as well.
[00:01:43.493 --> 00:01:46.115]  So be checking the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[00:01:46.476 --> 00:01:47.837]  Be checking our Ustream channel.
[00:01:48.658 --> 00:01:55.264]  And we'll be putting all the links of that in this video so you can check that, bookmark it, and go back to it as Bilderberg takes place.
[00:01:55.304 --> 00:01:59.527]  We'll be landing on Monday, on the 7th of June.
[00:01:59.728 --> 00:02:05.052]  And what makes this Bilderberg so different from all the others is now we have this war in the Ukraine.
[00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:09.436]  So that is going to be on the main agenda of what is talked about there in Bilderberg.
[00:02:09.456 --> 00:02:10.678]  Of course, it'll all be in secret.
[00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:13.040]  Also about the killing of cash.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.401]  That is now the new buzzword.
[00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:18.865]  We have to get rid of cash so we can let bankers basically not even print money anymore.
[00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:25.210]  They're just going to change digits in spreadsheets and thereby giving themselves millions and taking it away from us.
[00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.554]  And also the amount of foreign immigrants they're going to be bringing into Europe.
[00:02:29.594 --> 00:02:30.555]  That will be discussed.
[00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:34.658]  They're definitely doing it here on our southern border and it's not just Mexican immigrants.
[00:02:34.698 --> 00:02:38.562]  It's also Central American, South American and even African.
[00:02:39.062 --> 00:02:42.684]  Immigrants, as we've shown the videos here and showed you the news reports.
[00:02:42.884 --> 00:02:45.986]  So there's a lot to be talked about at this year's Bilderberg.
[00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:47.467]  So this is going to be a very important one.
[00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:50.589]  Also, it is right near the G7.
[00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:59.555]  In fact, the G7 is going to be just a few days before Bilderberg, and it's only going to be about 40 miles away in Elmau, which is, I believe, in Germany.
[00:03:00.402 --> 00:03:01.463]  The Bavarian area.
[00:03:01.763 --> 00:03:07.026]  And so they will be traveling from there to the Hotel Interhalpen for Bilderberg 2015.
[00:03:07.827 --> 00:03:17.112]  ExtremeNews.com reports that the Interhalpen Hotel is just a 26 kilometer or a 40 minute drive from the Ilmu region where they will be meeting for the G7.
[00:03:17.252 --> 00:03:22.716]  ExtremeNews also reports that up to 2,000 Austrian police will be in the area surrounding the hotel.
[00:03:23.256 --> 00:03:29.660]  Also up to 24 specialists from the anti-terrorism elite unit, which they call COBRA, which I think is really interesting,
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.001]  Cobra being the mortal enemy of the fictional G.I.
[00:03:33.081 --> 00:03:33.401]  Joe.
[00:03:34.021 --> 00:03:41.102]  And in addition, there's going to be up to 17,000 German police officers on the border ready to come in if called for.
[00:03:41.142 --> 00:03:48.124]  And they're estimating up to 360 million being spent on all the security, of course, which the taxpayers are going to be paying for.
[00:03:48.424 --> 00:03:52.165]  Journalist Heiko Schrang reported in his newsletter that the abolition of cash
[00:03:52.805 --> 00:04:16.592]  In addition to the issues in the Ukraine conflict and the promotion of refugee flows to Europe will be on this year's Bilderberg agenda and I'm sure there will be other issues of importance that will be talked about in this year's meeting and we'll be getting those through the leaks through the normal channels of people hearing what's going on there and coming out and saying hey this is bad we've got these world leaders planning some really terrifying things so we're going to be getting a lot of tips that way you can rest assured.
[00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:40.912]  I found an interesting tidbit on a website called Ausberger Allgemein and they're reporting that the footpaths and different hiking trails around the Hotel Interalpen are already being controlled and they say, this is interesting, hikers are advised to insert a card in the pack, which I think means have your ID on you, but that's how Google Translator translated this particular article.
[00:04:41.212 --> 00:04:50.096]  But we're going to put the links to all these articles down there, and I encourage you to get them, translate them for yourself, or if you do speak German, maybe put what they're really saying in these in the comments below.
[00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:59.080]  The Der Standard contains a report from publisher Oskar Bronner, and what she talks about alternative conferences that'll be taking place, one in Innsbruck and one in Telfs.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.303]  The Innsbruck one will be more like a conference where people are going to get together to talk about Bilderberg, and Telfs will actually be a demonstration.
[00:05:06.443 --> 00:05:10.705]  Telfs is a really small... Alright, see the full report at InfoWars.com, we're live on Thursday, stay with us.
[00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:18.210]  Despite this administration's dedication to transparency, FOIA backlogs have soared since President Barack Obama took office in 2009.
[00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:24.093]  A spike in requests is to be expected in an administration plagued with scandal.
[00:05:24.353 --> 00:05:36.541]  After it was revealed that they'd singled out conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status, the IRS cost the taxpayers $20 million so they could hand over more than a million pages of documents to investigators.
[00:05:36.721 --> 00:05:39.264]  And that doesn't even include Lois Lerner's emails.
[00:05:39.564 --> 00:05:48.373]  Speaking of missing emails, the House GOP has threatened to block some State Department funding until officials speed up their response to FOIA requests.
[00:05:48.653 --> 00:05:53.338]  The State Department responded saying the funding cut would only further cripple its efforts.
[00:05:53.678 --> 00:05:57.919]  After all, it's not just the Benghazi scandal and Hillary's email practices.
[00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:07.082]  The state's also dealing with massive FOIA requests for how contributions to the Clinton Foundation may or may not have influenced Clinton on the job.
[00:06:07.422 --> 00:06:09.983]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:17.625]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:07:10.566 --> 00:07:11.807]  Another major health threat.
[00:07:11.827 --> 00:07:16.709]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:19.430]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:26.233]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:07:26.513 --> 00:07:29.374]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:07:29.494 --> 00:07:32.456]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:07:32.536 --> 00:07:34.437]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:07:34.477 --> 00:07:37.318]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:07:37.398 --> 00:07:42.900]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.602]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:07:46.622 --> 00:07:49.623]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:07:49.723 --> 00:07:56.806]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:07:57.026 --> 00:08:00.087]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:08:07.451 --> 00:08:08.612]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:08.652 --> 00:08:09.132]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:49.717]  Yesterday, I talked about the fact that people like Vince Vaughn coming out for the Second Amendment and against the worship of a state.
[00:09:01.209 --> 00:09:14.501]  Was another major crack in the facade or another hole letting light in in the electronic Berlin Wall that dinosaur so-called mainstream media has been projecting.
[00:09:15.082 --> 00:09:20.687]  The facade that everybody's happy and everything's wonderful like the Lego movie theme song.
[00:09:22.836 --> 00:09:44.465]  And that everybody basically is on the mainstream Republican or mainstream Democrat reservation, when every poll, every sociological indicator shows, not just here in the United States or Canada, or Mexico for that matter, not just in North America, but all over the world, there is unprecedented awakenings happening right now.
[00:09:44.945 --> 00:09:49.347]  And the establishment is trying to co-opt those, but unsuccessfully in many cases.
[00:09:51.496 --> 00:10:06.790]  That's why it's more important than ever for those of us that want to promote cultures of Renaissance, cultures of the Enlightenment, cultures of true liberalism, in the Thomas Jeffersonian vein, need to be more aggressive and louder than ever.
[00:10:08.051 --> 00:10:18.260]  Publishing and speaking and suing and producing culture, resisting, demonstrating, voting with our dollars,
[00:10:19.707 --> 00:10:21.729]  Taking people out shooting for the first time.
[00:10:22.529 --> 00:10:26.273]  I'm gonna take someone who's never been out shooting.
[00:10:27.153 --> 00:10:27.353]  Ever.
[00:10:27.614 --> 00:10:29.115]  With shotgun skeet shooting.
[00:10:29.555 --> 00:10:31.157]  They'll be converted within minutes.
[00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:35.020]  They have trepidation now.
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.603]  They'll have that gleam in their eye within five minutes.
[00:10:40.685 --> 00:10:42.466]  Finding out that there was nothing magic about it.
[00:10:42.486 --> 00:10:43.267]  That it was no big deal.
[00:10:43.307 --> 00:10:44.728]  That they could be empowered.
[00:10:46.129 --> 00:10:46.750]  It's that simple.
[00:10:47.898 --> 00:10:59.820]  That's why they want control of our kids in the schools to convert them to all the globalist ideologies before we can convert adults into loving freedom.
[00:11:04.661 --> 00:11:14.583]  There is, as usual, an over-the-top amount of key news today on the TPP, on WikiLeaks,
[00:11:17.899 --> 00:11:19.479]  On Bilderberg with their agenda.
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.820]  With the Iran situation.
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:29.182]  Black Chicago pastors are embracing more Libertarian Republican candidates like Rand Paul.
[00:11:30.422 --> 00:11:33.683]  Slacktivist Susan Sarandon too lazy to wear anti-gun t-shirt.
[00:11:34.163 --> 00:11:44.265]  That ties into John Cusack, who I think is a great actor, talks Love and Mercy, it's a Daily Beast article, and says Obama is worse than Bush.
[00:11:46.437 --> 00:11:53.062]  So again, another example of that electronic Berlin Wall having more and more holes poked in it.
[00:11:57.345 --> 00:11:59.327]  Ray Kurzweil says humans will be hybrids by 2030.
[00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:01.969]  That's in my technology stack.
[00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:09.054]  Boehner says they don't have the votes yet on trade deal, but it remains secret.
[00:12:14.098 --> 00:12:15.539]  Boehner moving to give Obama
[00:12:17.739 --> 00:12:18.899]  New secret powers.
[00:12:23.941 --> 00:12:24.201]  U.N.
[00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:27.242]  climate regime says that the U.N.
[00:12:27.282 --> 00:12:28.822]  must bypass the U.S.
[00:12:28.882 --> 00:12:29.342]  Congress.
[00:12:30.283 --> 00:12:32.243]  Save the Earth, of course, not a power grab.
[00:12:34.744 --> 00:12:36.344]  We're going to be breaking it all down today.
[00:12:37.705 --> 00:12:38.445]  Paul Watson
[00:12:40.157 --> 00:12:48.066]  Had police creeping around his house and in his backyard yesterday, and then as soon as he went out to talk to them, they ran off.
[00:12:50.588 --> 00:12:53.091]  That's probably tied to Bilderberg.
[00:12:54.933 --> 00:13:01.921]  I myself had local police, county police, regional police, MI5, you name it, waiting for me.
[00:13:03.672 --> 00:13:19.096]  At the airport and at my hotel and when I would walk out to the car I had different visits with I guess four different agencies when I went to cover Bilderberg north of London in Watford three years ago.
[00:13:22.036 --> 00:13:23.617]  Hard to believe it's that long ago already.
[00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:28.938]  David Knight had similar run-ins
[00:13:31.693 --> 00:13:33.334]  Last year in Copenhagen, Denmark.
[00:13:34.415 --> 00:13:56.549]  Well, this year it's in a rural mountainous area of the Austrian Alps, and it's in local German newspapers, and local Austrian newspapers, mainline newspapers, that within five miles of it, because it's a popular skiing and hiking area, there are federal police, and you can't make this up, I'm not joking, COBRA security,
[00:13:58.817 --> 00:13:59.958]  Hail Cobra!
[00:14:00.678 --> 00:14:04.942]  Cobra Security will be providing security for the Bilderberg Group.
[00:14:05.442 --> 00:14:09.385]  Destro will be in the woods checking everyone's IDs.
[00:14:12.988 --> 00:14:20.994]  And yes, there'll be international arms dealers and other Cobra-like individuals inside the meeting, which didn't exist in mainstream media until about 10 years ago.
[00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:26.458]  We, I and many others like Jim Tucker, forced it, you forced it, into mainstream news.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.060]  The U.S.
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.782]  still will deny it exists sometimes.
[00:14:29.802 --> 00:14:40.250]  They'll have articles schizophrenically saying it doesn't exist, we're totally insane in the New York Times, and then I'm wandering around having a full-blown schizophrenic hallucination in Virginia when they're having the meeting.
[00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:50.999]  Helicopters, Secret Service, Marines, video of it, Secret Service lifting up MP5, hecklers, HK's,
[00:14:52.395 --> 00:14:53.715]  Obama and Hillary go in.
[00:14:53.775 --> 00:14:54.975]  No one knows where they are for a day.
[00:14:55.015 --> 00:14:55.736]  It's all over the news.
[00:14:55.956 --> 00:14:56.856]  They've disappeared.
[00:14:57.176 --> 00:14:58.456]  They were supposed to be on an airplane.
[00:14:58.736 --> 00:15:00.536]  They slam the door, fly to Chicago.
[00:15:01.297 --> 00:15:08.378]  We go find them, call the media, and they respond by having Marines in plain clothes trying to set us up for terrorism.
[00:15:10.538 --> 00:15:11.638]  That's America, folks.
[00:15:13.159 --> 00:15:15.319]  And believe me, big decisions are being made at this one.
[00:15:15.979 --> 00:15:18.620]  They have the hotel shut down a full week before.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.000]  That's never been done, this big luxury hotel.
[00:15:24.631 --> 00:15:27.232]  I do have part of their agenda now from one of my sources.
[00:15:28.813 --> 00:15:32.214]  It just dovetails with their Davos announcements and other statements.
[00:15:33.594 --> 00:15:38.756]  They will now publish, a day before it starts generally, part of their agenda.
[00:15:39.676 --> 00:15:41.057]  That will only be the cover agenda.
[00:15:43.442 --> 00:16:02.413]  They don't like the fact that we go in beforehand, talk to the workers, and say, when they're totally rude to you and mean to you and you hear horrible things being said, you won't want to talk to me now, you're going to be threatened with arrest or being fired or whatever, but you can come to whatever bar you choose at said time and give us intel.
[00:16:04.302 --> 00:16:06.223]  And they're always, never, I'm never going to talk to you.
[00:16:06.743 --> 00:16:11.765]  You go to the bar, or you go to the restaurant, or you go to the park, and they show up.
[00:16:12.245 --> 00:16:13.345]  They're like, it is horrible!
[00:16:13.725 --> 00:16:23.849]  They say they will enslave everyone, and will implode the economy as soon as they can, and take everyone's children, basically, and you cannot look them in the eyes, they are so horrible!
[00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:25.109]  They are evil!
[00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:27.370]  These are the conversations.
[00:16:28.171 --> 00:16:30.491]  Jim Tucker started doing that thirty-something years ago.
[00:16:30.511 --> 00:16:31.972]  Of course, he died two years ago.
[00:16:33.055 --> 00:16:33.755]  Or a year and a half ago.
[00:16:34.636 --> 00:16:35.476]  God rest his soul.
[00:16:37.277 --> 00:16:41.079]  But he was just a mainline crime and sports writer for big syndicates across the country.
[00:16:41.099 --> 00:16:42.720]  He was editor of major newspapers.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:55.787]  And he read articles by the late great at that time, Westbrook Pegler, from a decade before, that one of his readers sent him about a secret group meeting once a year setting agenda.
[00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:56.847]  And he said, that's impossible.
[00:16:56.987 --> 00:16:57.708]  I'd know about it.
[00:16:57.728 --> 00:16:58.588]  It'd be all over the news.
[00:16:59.228 --> 00:17:00.429]  World leaders meeting in secret.
[00:17:02.796 --> 00:17:04.377]  It's like a G20 meeting in secret.
[00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:09.520]  And there's other secret meetings too, but this is the one that blows them all wide open.
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.760]  It's basically a Spectre meeting.
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.882]  That's what it is, a Spectre meeting.
[00:17:17.404 --> 00:17:21.146]  And they don't like people looking into it, so that's why it's a big deal.
[00:17:21.186 --> 00:17:22.767]  Some people say, why even cover it?
[00:17:23.027 --> 00:17:26.609]  And yeah, it's expensive to send three reporters to Europe.
[00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:28.170]  It's expensive.
[00:17:29.974 --> 00:17:34.175]  But we've now exposed it exists, now people listen, we can expose the agenda.
[00:17:34.995 --> 00:17:37.676]  Our intel ends up being in newspapers around the world.
[00:17:39.137 --> 00:17:40.797]  And we reach tens of millions of new people.
[00:17:41.938 --> 00:17:45.559]  And so, now they want us to just say, okay, we're meeting in secret, big deal, move along.
[00:17:45.859 --> 00:17:48.199]  No, you said you didn't exist, now you exist.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.420]  You're violating all sorts of different laws in different countries.
[00:17:52.181 --> 00:17:54.941]  The Logan Act here, meeting in secret setting policy.
[00:17:55.281 --> 00:17:56.802]  And here are the annals, leaked.
[00:17:58.669 --> 00:18:01.571]  I mean, I've been at Bilderberg in Virginia a few years ago.
[00:18:01.911 --> 00:18:04.073]  They have it every fourth year here.
[00:18:06.074 --> 00:18:07.135]  In Chantilly, usually.
[00:18:07.155 --> 00:18:14.379]  In between all these defense contractor complexes, there's a five-star Marriott conference hotel.
[00:18:18.122 --> 00:18:27.168]  And, you know, just a vet pulls up on a big Harley and says, I'm giving you stuff out of the National Archives.
[00:18:28.683 --> 00:18:29.624]  That is restricted.
[00:18:30.504 --> 00:18:32.246]  And it says not for release on the top.
[00:18:32.306 --> 00:18:34.167]  And it's... We published them.
[00:18:34.487 --> 00:18:35.508]  Famous US Senator.
[00:18:36.489 --> 00:18:37.810]  Eight different years of the annals.
[00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:38.710]  Meeting in secret.
[00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:39.511]  The Rockefellers.
[00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:40.351]  The heads of the unions.
[00:18:40.632 --> 00:18:41.812]  How to sell America out.
[00:18:42.133 --> 00:18:43.454]  How to take over the economy.
[00:18:43.474 --> 00:18:45.615]  And it's from the 60s.
[00:18:46.816 --> 00:18:47.417]  Early 60s.
[00:18:49.738 --> 00:18:50.659]  Hundreds of pages of it.
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.362]  I mean, that's the type of stuff we get when we're at these events.
[00:18:56.563 --> 00:18:57.564]  And it was just a veteran.
[00:18:59.636 --> 00:19:00.976]  Who works in the National Archives.
[00:19:02.837 --> 00:19:04.978]  And he said, you couldn't believe what's in there.
[00:19:05.438 --> 00:19:09.679]  He goes, a lot of it's classified, I can't tell you, but this is just restricted.
[00:19:09.699 --> 00:19:13.081]  And he goes, I could probably get fired for this, but here it is.
[00:19:13.181 --> 00:19:22.704]  And then, separately, part of those annals had already been released before, and it was confirmed those were real annals stamped National Archives.
[00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:26.296]  This is what's going on, folks.
[00:19:26.336 --> 00:19:28.236]  This is where the real decisions are being made.
[00:19:28.577 --> 00:19:38.101]  Just like we can't see the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and it's all secret, and we're just told let these people decide, and we can't even find out who's involved.
[00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:40.682]  This is rule by secrecy.
[00:19:41.002 --> 00:19:43.483]  This is global totalitarian corporate fascism.
[00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.805]  Paul Watson has got some of the same sorts as I've got.
[00:19:47.825 --> 00:19:48.525]  We're working together.
[00:19:49.006 --> 00:19:49.626]  Tomorrow,
[00:19:51.553 --> 00:19:56.177]  It may be Monday, but we don't like to release stuff on Friday, but we like to release it when we have it, and it's ready.
[00:19:56.217 --> 00:19:56.677]  It's ready.
[00:19:57.338 --> 00:19:58.179]  Maybe even today.
[00:19:58.959 --> 00:20:05.265]  We've learned part of the major agenda of Bilderberg, and we're going to be publishing that very, very soon.
[00:20:05.665 --> 00:20:09.708]  Very important information, and that's all coming up as well.
[00:20:09.728 --> 00:20:10.329]  He'll be joining us.
[00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:16.393]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader, MyPatriotSupply.
[00:20:16.954 --> 00:20:22.538]  Once you try them, you'll know why so many Americans like you have made them part of their emergency preparedness plan.

[00:21:08.769 --> 00:21:09.649]  Call today.
[00:21:10.109 --> 00:21:16.312]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:16.772 --> 00:21:24.515]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:24.875 --> 00:21:32.758]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:37.800]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.861]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:43.362 --> 00:21:47.083]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:47.703 --> 00:21:48.724]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:48.784 --> 00:21:52.869]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:53.289 --> 00:21:57.674]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:58.195 --> 00:22:00.758]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:01.198 --> 00:22:02.840]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:03.200]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:09.247 --> 00:22:11.028]  Are you suffering from EP?
[00:22:11.349 --> 00:22:14.171]  The symptoms include fraudulent charges to your credit card.
[00:22:14.251 --> 00:22:16.613]  Your subway card says it's empty, but you bought it yesterday.
[00:22:16.873 --> 00:22:21.396]  Someone's been in your hotel room, but the desk clerk says they only show you entering the room.
[00:22:21.656 --> 00:22:23.157]  These are signs of EP.
[00:22:23.458 --> 00:22:24.899]  Electronic pickpocketing.
[00:22:25.099 --> 00:22:27.921]  Payment cards, transit cards, even hotel room keys.
[00:22:28.201 --> 00:22:33.365]  Use a radio chip so you can just wave your card at the register, the turnstile, or your hotel room door.
[00:22:33.545 --> 00:22:37.488]  But what's convenient for you is also convenient for thieves, waving scanners,
[00:22:37.728 --> 00:22:40.550]  To electronically pickpocket you without even touching you.
[00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:42.651]  The good news is there's a cure.
[00:22:43.032 --> 00:22:48.095]  ID Stronghold has created leather wallets and clutches that have built-in EP protection.
[00:22:48.395 --> 00:22:54.159]  Layers of shielding material cleverly concealed in a beautiful leather wallet that stops the symptoms of EP.

[00:22:57.661 --> 00:22:58.782]  IDStronghold.com

[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:09.721]  Hey, Berkey Guy here.
[00:23:09.801 --> 00:23:11.501]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[00:23:11.622 --> 00:23:13.322]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[00:23:13.403 --> 00:23:15.223]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?

[00:24:06.614 --> 00:24:07.495]  Come and take it!
[00:24:16.028 --> 00:24:29.399]  I hear the train a-comin' It's rollin' around the bend And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when I'm stuck in Folsom Prison And time keeps draggin' on
[00:24:33.339 --> 00:24:34.960]  On down to San Antonio.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:35.901]  I was just a baby!
[00:24:52.653 --> 00:24:59.458]  You go to grudgereport.com, we have the same spattering of breaking news and infowars.com, and I like how Grudge presents it.
[00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:02.660]  Big, giant, bold, red letters.
[00:25:03.341 --> 00:25:04.362]  Obama Trade.
[00:25:04.582 --> 00:25:06.904]  Global access to citizens' data.
[00:25:08.717 --> 00:25:11.099]  Boehner pushes new secret White House powers.
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.481]  Tech still hidden in Capitol basement.
[00:25:14.002 --> 00:25:20.428]  And you notice on Monday, I began thrashing on Sunday and Monday Julian Assange.
[00:25:21.168 --> 00:25:23.010]  And I don't want to attack Julian Assange.
[00:25:23.631 --> 00:25:24.812]  I haven't made my mind up about him.
[00:25:26.674 --> 00:25:27.514]  What's going on there?
[00:25:29.256 --> 00:25:34.521]  It looks like he's a conduit for different agencies and governments and corporations to battle with each other.
[00:25:35.732 --> 00:25:40.376]  A lot of smart money says the same thing, but the issue is it doesn't matter.
[00:25:40.476 --> 00:25:41.437]  We want the data.
[00:25:42.357 --> 00:25:47.761]  They said a year and a half ago that they had the whole 30-plus part trade deal.
[00:25:49.223 --> 00:25:51.444]  Then they said it was only 28 pieces.
[00:25:52.685 --> 00:25:54.266]  Okay, and now 27 pieces.
[00:25:55.227 --> 00:25:57.389]  And I said, what are you doing not releasing it?
[00:25:57.749 --> 00:25:58.750]  And I went back to the news.
[00:25:59.771 --> 00:26:01.592]  They had said back then that they had the whole thing.
[00:26:03.113 --> 00:26:04.955]  And they have these fundraisers where they say,
[00:26:06.015 --> 00:26:11.098]  There's a bounty, or, or, or, if you help us raise funds, we'll release this, or we'll release that.
[00:26:11.959 --> 00:26:13.860]  Then they spun it yesterday, let us raise $100,000.
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:19.223]  That was in Reuters.
[00:26:19.263 --> 00:26:24.486]  WikiLeaks offers a $100,000 bounty for Asian trade pact, pushed by Obama.
[00:26:25.046 --> 00:26:28.949]  And then now, today, they say they have it, and they've released part of it.
[00:26:31.502 --> 00:26:36.623]  And it basically puts all your medical data, your financial data, everything into a big giant global database.
[00:26:37.103 --> 00:26:37.643]  Here's the truth.
[00:26:37.723 --> 00:26:38.683]  It's already been done.
[00:26:39.104 --> 00:26:41.524]  They're just going to try to certify this fraud.
[00:26:42.924 --> 00:26:43.825]  This is global government.
[00:26:46.285 --> 00:26:48.065]  And so now they've released it.
[00:26:48.806 --> 00:26:51.606]  Whether they had it before or didn't is a bit foggy.
[00:26:53.587 --> 00:26:55.767]  But we have the trade and services agreement.
[00:26:58.459 --> 00:27:15.536]  WikiLeaks released today 17 secret documents from the ongoing TISA, Trade and Services Agreement negotiations, which cover the United States, the European Union, and 23 other countries including Turkey, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Pakistan, Taiwan, Israel, which together compromise two-thirds of global GDP.
[00:27:15.556 --> 00:27:17.397]  And then they go through it.
[00:27:18.018 --> 00:27:22.803]  Forbes now breaks it down.
[00:27:24.537 --> 00:27:28.098]  Leaked documents reveal privacy threat.
[00:27:28.938 --> 00:27:30.558]  And Forbes goes over the documents.
[00:27:30.738 --> 00:27:35.019]  We can put Wikileaks up on screen and click and show folks those documents if you're a TV viewer.
[00:27:37.779 --> 00:27:52.362]  That basically eviscerate what privacy you have left and then hands your data over to all these financial institutions, corporate institutions and others who already form a bigger threat to our liberties than government.
[00:27:53.183 --> 00:28:21.324]  And I had a former top NSA officer on the broadcast yesterday agreeing that it's a corporate fascist takeover and that the new USA Freedom Act to replace the Patriot Act is worse in many respects and simply legalizes what corporations are already doing, storing and using everything you do, your data, down to audio, video, text, emails, your shopping habits, your credit card info, your social security, all of it.
[00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:28.812]  And then as the data breaches get worse and worse, they're going to push global standardized data attached to biometrics.
[00:28:28.892 --> 00:28:33.974]  Retina scanning, face scanning, voice print, hand print, thumb print, index finger print.
[00:28:34.334 --> 00:28:39.516]  And then you're going to have to biometrically scan to buy and sell and to get online and buy.
[00:28:39.536 --> 00:28:41.097]  This has all been proposed for a decade.
[00:28:43.678 --> 00:28:56.427]  So then you can be tracked with your internet ID and you can be banned from the internet after three global offenses that the TPP in its UN document section on the internet shows.
[00:28:56.728 --> 00:29:06.315]  They plan to tax the internet, track the internet, trace everything you're doing, and then if they claim you violate something, copyright or hate laws or whatever the case is,
[00:29:08.098 --> 00:29:14.641]  Three strikes, no judge, no jury, you will be banned from the internet like a convicted hacker.
[00:29:18.362 --> 00:29:18.822]  Globally.
[00:29:22.223 --> 00:29:23.584]  You're going to have to thumbprint.
[00:29:24.104 --> 00:29:33.728]  That's why all the new Microsoft software for at least six, seven years coming out, to access it, it already has it in place that you'll have to biometrically thumbprint or index print to be able to do that.
[00:29:39.847 --> 00:29:41.889]  It's simply over-the-top insane.
[00:29:42.189 --> 00:29:45.732]  And remember, now two sections of 20-plus are public.
[00:29:46.692 --> 00:29:48.634]  I want WikiLeaks to release it all.
[00:29:49.174 --> 00:29:50.115]  Don't dole it out.
[00:29:50.395 --> 00:29:51.036]  Don't do this.
[00:29:51.236 --> 00:29:53.017]  They're trying to pass it in the House right now.
[00:29:53.357 --> 00:29:54.538]  It's already passed the Senate.
[00:29:54.819 --> 00:29:56.540]  Release it all, WikiLeaks.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.962]  Release it all now.
[00:30:00.163 --> 00:30:01.063]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.564 --> 00:30:03.165]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.086 --> 00:30:06.768]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.987 --> 00:30:11.527]  The U.S.
[00:30:11.607 --> 00:30:14.749]  now claims the Syrian government is working with ISIS.
[00:30:14.989 --> 00:30:16.149]  Officials at the U.S.
[00:30:16.269 --> 00:30:30.516]  Embassy Syria Twitter account accused the regime of aiding ISIS in the takeover of Aleppo this week, alleging President Assad has not only avoided engaging ISIS targets, but has actively attempted to bolster their position with airstrikes.
[00:30:30.836 --> 00:30:32.978]  Talk about a major shift in narrative.
[00:30:33.098 --> 00:30:42.246]  Since the beginning of Syria's so-called civil war, the Obama administration has funded and armed radical Islamists under the guise of supporting moderate rebels.
[00:30:42.466 --> 00:30:47.230]  Last February, the president even handed the Free Syrian Army the ability to order U.S.
[00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:48.071]  airstrikes.
[00:30:48.371 --> 00:30:57.760]  And one jihadist told Al Jazeera in 2013, FSA fighters regularly sell their weapons to ISIS once receiving shipments from the U.S.
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.101]  Well, that's when the U.S.
[00:30:59.161 --> 00:31:03.385]  isn't accidentally dropping weapons right in ISIS territory.
[00:31:03.565 --> 00:31:07.189]  So, who's really trying to bolster their position in Syria?
[00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:09.992]  Read the full story at InfoWars.com
[00:31:10.771 --> 00:31:15.515]  Alex Jones here with an InfoWarsLive.com Consumer Alert Report.
[00:31:15.935 --> 00:31:22.981]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[00:31:23.261 --> 00:31:31.027]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:31:31.347 --> 00:31:32.328]  The bad news is
[00:31:32.668 --> 00:31:39.956]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at Infowarslife.com of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine are running low.
[00:31:40.336 --> 00:31:44.761]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these Deep Earth Crystals.
[00:31:45.141 --> 00:31:52.329]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:55.412]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[00:31:55.632 --> 00:32:02.315]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[00:32:02.615 --> 00:32:06.597]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:32:10.495 --> 00:32:30.082]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[00:32:30.242 --> 00:32:30.662]  Well then,
[00:32:31.022 --> 00:32:34.684]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.

[00:32:45.049 --> 00:32:48.791]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.

[00:33:03.483 --> 00:33:07.852]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[00:33:08.193 --> 00:33:09.115]  HDFirearms.com
[00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:31.295]  You are a programmable guy that goes and watches Olympus is Falling and believes all this and really thinks you're a hero.
[00:33:31.535 --> 00:33:32.136]  G.I.
[00:33:32.176 --> 00:33:34.197]  Joe, great American hero.
[00:33:34.478 --> 00:33:35.298]  Joe, Joe.
[00:33:35.678 --> 00:33:36.919]  You don't work for Joe.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.280]  Joe got taken over.
[00:33:39.161 --> 00:33:39.682]  The G.I.
[00:33:39.722 --> 00:33:42.284]  Joe command base is run by Cobra.
[00:33:43.104 --> 00:33:43.924]  You understand that?
[00:33:44.305 --> 00:33:49.326]  And I use a child analogy to get through to you because that's your main programming template in North America.
[00:33:49.486 --> 00:33:50.427]  They're on record with that.
[00:33:50.847 --> 00:33:52.187]  That was all Pentagon directed.
[00:33:52.928 --> 00:33:54.508]  You understand you work for Cobra.
[00:33:54.768 --> 00:33:56.009]  You dress like Cobra.
[00:33:56.229 --> 00:33:57.629]  You have the tactics of Cobra.
[00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:59.010]  You are Cobra.
[00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:00.230]  Hail Cobra!
[00:34:01.111 --> 00:34:02.151]  You want to be little boys?
[00:34:02.171 --> 00:34:04.552]  Or do you want to really join the Republic?
[00:34:05.092 --> 00:34:09.994]  They know what's going on at the Bundy Ranch, and they won't even let a police information officer give us any information.
[00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:10.994]  That's a bunch of bull****.
[00:34:11.434 --> 00:34:12.795]  It's all these stupid G.I.
[00:34:12.855 --> 00:34:15.536]  Joe movies and stuff, where the White House is attacked.
[00:34:15.736 --> 00:34:17.537]  The White House is run by Cobra!
[00:34:17.977 --> 00:34:25.820]  When I went through the process of becoming press secretary, one of the things, one of the first things they told me was, you're not even to acknowledge the drone program.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.441]  You're not even to discuss that it exists.
[00:34:29.001 --> 00:34:30.161]  It's run by chaos.
[00:34:30.641 --> 00:34:31.762]  It's run by Spectre.
[00:34:32.522 --> 00:34:37.126]  Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion.
[00:34:37.967 --> 00:34:41.650]  They run little kids, they run the snuff films, they run the drugs, they run it all!
[00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:46.474]  And because you act like a bunch of naive chumps, this whole thing's gonna come down on us!
[00:34:46.814 --> 00:34:52.559]  Very much concerns me, considering that they have all this bulk ammunition, that they're shooting targets of children.
[00:34:53.079 --> 00:34:55.181]  Would you like to tell me who it is that is doing this?
[00:34:55.701 --> 00:34:57.583]  It is the Department of Homeland Security, sir.
[00:34:58.263 --> 00:34:59.665]  Oh, thank you for calling.
[00:34:59.745 --> 00:34:59.985]  Click.
[00:35:00.205 --> 00:35:05.888]  To every police officer in this country, to every FBI agent, to every Secret Service agent, you work for Spectre.
[00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:07.409]  You work for Chaos.
[00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:11.692]  You work for Cobra.
[00:35:12.733 --> 00:35:13.553]  How do they get power?
[00:35:13.753 --> 00:35:18.196]  They stage a terror attack using Spectre, using Cobra.
[00:35:22.506 --> 00:35:23.206]  Go f*** yourself.
[00:35:23.726 --> 00:35:24.327]  Who is COBRA?
[00:35:24.507 --> 00:35:28.028]  Arms dealing, drug dealing, money laundering group, wearing masks.
[00:35:28.328 --> 00:35:32.249]  They wear masks, ladies and gentlemen, because they're the corporate CEOs.
[00:35:32.869 --> 00:35:35.110]  And they're manipulating the governments against each other.
[00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:36.930]  COBRA runs the Muslims.
[00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.731]  COBRA runs the CIA.
[00:35:39.031 --> 00:35:40.151]  COBRA runs it all.
[00:35:40.411 --> 00:35:41.411]  COBRA is real.
[00:35:41.871 --> 00:35:43.372]  You can call it whatever you want.
[00:35:44.705 --> 00:35:46.526]  Cobra is in control of America.
[00:35:46.786 --> 00:35:52.650]  And Cobra says the veterans and the gun owners, they're saying that we're the bad guys.
[00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:57.633]  These people who hold themselves down to be patriots are not.
[00:35:58.174 --> 00:36:00.315]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[00:36:00.655 --> 00:36:02.056]  That's what Cobra would say.
[00:36:02.276 --> 00:36:03.657]  That's what Specter would say.
[00:36:04.037 --> 00:36:05.578]  That's what Goldfinger would say.
[00:36:05.818 --> 00:36:07.840]  Because that's who those people are.
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:13.103]  I am Supreme Cobra Commander!
[00:36:13.143 --> 00:36:17.967]  You call your petty bureaucrats, officials, and authorities?
[00:36:18.047 --> 00:36:22.430]  You will kneel before Cobra or face my wrath!
[00:36:24.622 --> 00:36:28.287]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:36:28.708 --> 00:36:30.831]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:36:30.851 --> 00:36:34.136]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Cobra Leader.
[00:36:34.256 --> 00:36:36.399]  You pathetic little worm!
[00:36:36.559 --> 00:36:40.185]  How dare you call me Mr. Cobra!
[00:36:46.770 --> 00:37:02.733]  And you can go to Infowars.com and read the news article that links directly to mainstream Austrian newspapers that Cobra security based in Austria in a 17th century castle nearby will be running security for Bilderberg.
[00:37:02.873 --> 00:37:03.273]  That's right.
[00:37:03.713 --> 00:37:11.034]  Cobra security that wear black uniforms and are based in a castle will be providing security for the criminals at Bilderberg.
[00:37:12.394 --> 00:37:13.075]  There's the headline.
[00:37:13.115 --> 00:37:14.795]  Cobra, Bilderberg's weapon of choice.
[00:37:15.882 --> 00:37:35.545]  Extra Special Police Forces, known as COBRA, will be called in to operate security during the secretive meeting, and it's already in local papers yesterday that they are fanning out around local towns and in the forests and mountains, stopping skiers, stopping hikers, and demanding their IDs, putting them in a database.
[00:37:36.698 --> 00:37:56.624]  As if it's illegal that reporters would want to come cover 150 world leaders, Dutch-British royalty, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the heads of Google, the heads of Microsoft, the head of Facebook, you know, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, you know, the Chinese Secretary of State.
[00:37:57.924 --> 00:38:00.245]  I mean, that's the president of Spain.
[00:38:03.697 --> 00:38:04.858]  That's who goes to Bilderberg.
[00:38:04.978 --> 00:38:08.080]  I mean, last year they were like, it's preposterous the Prime Minister will be here.
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:08.941]  Jones, shut up!
[00:38:09.241 --> 00:38:09.902]  Two days before.
[00:38:10.742 --> 00:38:13.905]  Then here comes the, you know, helicopter landing with the Prime Minister.
[00:38:16.287 --> 00:38:20.650]  And they had federal cops following us around as if we didn't notice them.
[00:38:22.725 --> 00:38:26.367]  And then after these guys in suits come over and they're like, thanks a lot for not causing any problems.
[00:38:26.647 --> 00:38:29.288]  Like I'm gonna cause, quote, quote, problems.
[00:38:30.108 --> 00:38:32.249]  The people inside there are causing the problems.
[00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.471]  I'm shining a spotlight on roaches.
[00:38:37.452 --> 00:38:42.414]  I have no history of criminal activity, no history of assaulting anybody that didn't assault me first.
[00:38:44.375 --> 00:38:48.477]  I am there assaulting people with the truth, so I'll say now like I do every year.
[00:38:49.568 --> 00:38:57.183]  Paul Watson, Rob Dew, Josh Owens that are going, two from the US, one from Britannia, one from the UK.
[00:38:58.939 --> 00:39:01.900]  When the federal police, or anyone, walk over, what are you planning?
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:22.150]  Go, hey, you're trying to turn this around, we did something wrong, we're journalists, we're the press, watch out, gonna be a major international incident in the news, stop bowing up, stop putting your hand on your gun, stop threatening to write us tickets, and they'll be just like the Austrian police or the Switzerland police, the Swiss police, years ago, they totally backed down.
[00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.111]  It's all psychological.
[00:39:24.131 --> 00:39:25.752]  You gotta go, hey,
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:27.720]  You live in a free country.
[00:39:28.181 --> 00:39:29.381]  You claim Austria's free.
[00:39:29.901 --> 00:39:30.942]  You claim England's free.
[00:39:31.322 --> 00:39:32.842]  You claim the US is free.
[00:39:32.882 --> 00:39:39.305]  I mean, I remember the cops were saying we couldn't walk across the street at a crosswalk.
[00:39:40.285 --> 00:39:41.666]  The London Guardian reported on this.
[00:39:42.731 --> 00:39:45.893]  And I went over to the head cop in Virginia and I said, you're going to go ahead and arrest us.
[00:39:46.393 --> 00:39:49.895]  And I said, I don't say this because I hate cops or I hate you, but you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[00:39:50.335 --> 00:39:51.956]  Your kids aren't going to live in a free country.
[00:39:52.677 --> 00:39:56.599]  How dare you follow those criminals orders inside, try to keep us from demonstrating.
[00:39:56.939 --> 00:39:59.021]  You already had your colleague, the captain.
[00:40:00.261 --> 00:40:04.044]  Telling the hotel I'm at not to bring me here on a shuttle bus.
[00:40:05.365 --> 00:40:06.526]  You're impeding my rights.
[00:40:07.386 --> 00:40:11.589]  I said, go ahead, we're going to walk across this crosswalk and if you want to arrest us, that's fine.
[00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:13.511]  But it's not just that I'm going to sue you.
[00:40:13.791 --> 00:40:14.992]  I probably won't even sue you.
[00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:18.514]  I tell you what, you go ahead and you kill your children's future.
[00:40:18.894 --> 00:40:19.775]  This was in the newspaper.
[00:40:20.696 --> 00:40:22.217]  I mean, the Guardian was sitting there watching this.
[00:40:23.322 --> 00:40:25.904]  Because for hours the cops were going to arrest you, we're going to arrest you.
[00:40:25.924 --> 00:40:27.666]  I said, fine, arrest us.
[00:40:27.706 --> 00:40:29.667]  And we walked across live on the radio.
[00:40:29.687 --> 00:40:32.169]  Everybody's like, incredible, yay Alex!
[00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:33.070]  And I said, yay?
[00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:41.878]  We had to have a confrontation with the police to be able to walk across a stinking crosswalk outside of the hotel grounds?
[00:40:43.246 --> 00:40:56.629]  As tax-paying American citizens, they can just suspend our rights because we dare come with cameras and microphones and bullhorns to let a bunch of world globalist garbage that are usurping our freedoms?
[00:40:57.849 --> 00:41:03.130]  Yeah, there was the headline, Bilderberg 2012, Lennon Guardian, protesters hail their hero, Alex Jones.
[00:41:06.491 --> 00:41:10.852]  And the cops started trying to say, you know, we're just not going to allow demonstrations, period, the day before.
[00:41:14.065 --> 00:41:16.847]  And I just looked at this, was one of the cops was really bad.
[00:41:17.207 --> 00:41:20.389]  He was always trying to set us up and lying and the others were pretty good.
[00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.130]  And I just said, man, shame on you.
[00:41:22.671 --> 00:41:25.633]  I said, go ahead and try to arrest people for peacefully demonstrating.
[00:41:25.693 --> 00:41:26.193]  Go ahead.
[00:41:26.213 --> 00:41:26.934]  Go ahead.
[00:41:27.414 --> 00:41:28.034]  What are you doing?
[00:41:28.175 --> 00:41:30.136]  Auditioning for a job in Tiananmen Square?
[00:41:30.156 --> 00:41:34.018]  And it's not like we were protesting on somebody's private property.
[00:41:34.038 --> 00:41:35.560]  We were on the sidewalk.
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.361]  It's America, remember?
[00:41:38.301 --> 00:41:41.784]  And look, TPP, the climate's changed.
[00:41:42.728 --> 00:41:45.269]  We now can get people to admit there's a TPP.
[00:41:45.709 --> 00:41:47.450]  The TPP started in 2004.
[00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:58.636]  And back then, I would cover it, and I would have reporters at my office calling me going, and you claim they're setting up an Asian Union through a trade pact.
[00:41:58.696 --> 00:42:01.317]  And I'd go, yeah, it's in these policy reports.
[00:42:01.357 --> 00:42:03.638]  They've been meeting in secret for a couple of years.
[00:42:03.658 --> 00:42:07.840]  And they'd go, Mr. Jones, no one's meeting in secret for global deals.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.481]  That's all done out in the open.
[00:42:10.561 --> 00:42:11.882]  No one wants global government.
[00:42:13.951 --> 00:42:17.934]  Now we've gotten to the point where their stonewalling doesn't work, kind of like with Obamacare.
[00:42:18.274 --> 00:42:25.579]  It doesn't work to say it doesn't increase your prices anymore, and then it cuts them when everybody's seen their prices go up.
[00:42:25.599 --> 00:42:27.280]  50 to 3 times.
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:31.322]  50% is the low end, 3 times for others.
[00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:37.186]  Mine's gone up 100%, my parents have gone up 100% with no claims. 100%.
[00:42:42.435 --> 00:42:43.235]  We've got insurance.
[00:42:43.415 --> 00:42:47.417]  If somebody has a baby, or if you roll a car, your back's broken.
[00:42:48.738 --> 00:42:53.000]  To keep our insurance low, my dad always taught me just to have insurance, but pay for small stuff.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.621]  That doesn't matter anymore.
[00:42:55.681 --> 00:42:57.161]  Good behavior doesn't matter anymore.
[00:42:57.361 --> 00:43:00.403]  Being a good customer doesn't matter anymore, because they wrote a law to screw everybody.
[00:43:03.704 --> 00:43:07.706]  And now, GOP is open to extending Obamacare subsidies.
[00:43:09.406 --> 00:43:16.031]  And select corporations, they get to opt out of it, which again, is not a level playing field or competition.
[00:43:16.331 --> 00:43:33.884]  I want to go to Paul Joseph Watson, who is going to be spearheading our operations, InfoWars.com, Nightly News Director Rob Doolby there, supporting him so well, our great cameraman and editor and journalist as well, Josh Owens.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.721]  But the issue here is people now get rule by secrecy.
[00:43:38.761 --> 00:43:42.421]  They now understand there are big shadowy organizations taking control.
[00:43:43.662 --> 00:43:48.523]  They now understand that foreign-owned energy companies are moving into the U.S.
[00:43:48.583 --> 00:43:50.123]  and shutting down U.S.
[00:43:50.163 --> 00:43:53.084]  companies and city and county-owned power plants.
[00:43:53.684 --> 00:43:58.985]  People understand there are water districts being taken over and handed over pennies on the dollar and their prices double or triple.
[00:43:59.385 --> 00:44:01.685]  People understand looting is beginning.
[00:44:02.085 --> 00:44:05.206]  It's not privatization, it's pirate
[00:44:07.247 --> 00:44:07.968]  Privatization.
[00:44:09.609 --> 00:44:10.470]  It's piratical.
[00:44:11.731 --> 00:44:22.200]  And now it's coming out, leaked TISA documents from the TPP, say that your privacy's over, all your data's given to corporations, foreign governments, everything, pooled under an ultra-massive system.
[00:44:22.921 --> 00:44:29.347]  It shuts down competition, it doesn't let you open businesses where you want, it supervents and circumvents Congress.
[00:44:29.647 --> 00:44:30.528]  I mean, here it is today.
[00:44:32.796 --> 00:44:33.697]  New American Magazine.
[00:44:34.117 --> 00:44:42.485]  UN climate regime must bypass US Congress French court rules to save the world for global warming and they're now saying that our Constitution is trumped.
[00:44:42.905 --> 00:44:44.447]  This is global government.
[00:44:45.948 --> 00:44:53.295]  And Boehner says he doesn't have the votes yet but he thinks he'll have them soon, The Hill reports, but they still won't release the text.
[00:44:53.335 --> 00:44:57.079]  Well, a whole new subsection has been released
[00:44:58.126 --> 00:44:58.826]  By WikiLeaks.
[00:44:59.387 --> 00:45:01.087]  And it's just nightmare!
[00:45:01.828 --> 00:45:03.388]  Why aren't they releasing the rest?
[00:45:05.269 --> 00:45:20.175]  Because WikiLeaks, tied in with the Democratic Party and leftist organizations worldwide, doesn't want the gun control provisions that senators have told gun owners of America, privately, are in there.
[00:45:20.775 --> 00:45:21.636]  Of course it's in there.
[00:45:21.676 --> 00:45:22.836]  Obama said it's in there.
[00:45:22.856 --> 00:45:23.817]  It's in the UN Treaty.
[00:45:24.813 --> 00:45:26.234]  And the open border is garbage.
[00:45:26.514 --> 00:45:28.375]  The left wants that gun control.
[00:45:28.915 --> 00:45:30.676]  The left wants those open borders.
[00:45:31.736 --> 00:45:34.258]  The left wants the high taxes.
[00:45:34.558 --> 00:45:49.905]  They want the global carbon tax that is admittedly cemented through trade deals that are added as a carbon tariff that's been paid into an international global governance funding mechanism.
[00:45:51.095 --> 00:45:58.482]  So see, that's why Bilderberg's important, because it's another window into all the secretive activity that's going on.
[00:45:59.663 --> 00:46:02.306]  Joining us from the United Kingdom in London is Paul Watson.
[00:46:03.027 --> 00:46:06.830]  He tweeted yesterday that police were running around in his yard and then ran off when he went outside.
[00:46:07.651 --> 00:46:09.913]  He's trying to be stoic and saying it's probably no big deal.
[00:46:10.294 --> 00:46:14.077]  Paul, I think it's probably a 50% chance that it has to do with Bilderberg.
[00:46:15.598 --> 00:46:21.302]  But see, Bilderberg will do stuff like spoof your house for a SWAT team raid.
[00:46:21.902 --> 00:46:24.804]  Or if you were married, they'd call up and threaten to cut your wife's head off.
[00:46:25.505 --> 00:46:27.786]  I've had them do that when I'm at Bilderberg.
[00:46:27.806 --> 00:46:36.491]  They're calling back home, threatening my family and listening to the phone calls and then telling your wife or your spouse what you were just talking about on the phone to mess with them.
[00:46:36.992 --> 00:46:38.373]  No caller ID comes up.
[00:46:40.474 --> 00:46:43.476]  It may not be Bilderberg, but it could be.
[00:46:44.352 --> 00:46:48.176]  Uh, you know, they may put in the Interpol database just to mess with you that you're a narcotics trafficker.
[00:46:48.916 --> 00:46:52.960]  Uh, and then they'll take it out later once the low-level police find out it's not true.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.341]  They'll go, oh, that's an error, sorry.
[00:46:54.381 --> 00:47:00.787]  But this is what Bilderberg's able to do because most of the hotel is just filled with government agencies and spy groups.
[00:47:01.954 --> 00:47:03.956]  All spying on other governments that are there.
[00:47:04.036 --> 00:47:05.657]  So it's a huge secret summit.
[00:47:06.217 --> 00:47:07.658]  More important than the G20.
[00:47:08.539 --> 00:47:10.841]  And so we commend your courage to go cover it.
[00:47:11.962 --> 00:47:13.123]  I need to talk to you after the show today.
[00:47:13.183 --> 00:47:14.824]  I've got major intel on Bilderberg.
[00:47:14.884 --> 00:47:20.989]  I know you were past some of the sources and are able to ferret that.
[00:47:21.149 --> 00:47:30.436]  So Paul, when are you planning first to release what we know about the true Bilderberg agenda this year?
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:49.646]  I'm gonna do a video on it this weekend so it'll be out Monday and then we'll have the article version of that as well with all the hyperlinks so that'll be out on Monday with what we know about the agenda so far and obviously we're gonna get more information and put out more articles in the days after that.
[00:47:49.986 --> 00:47:51.967]  Now they've got the hotel shut down a week before.
[00:47:51.987 --> 00:47:56.449]  I would like you to go early and I mean obviously they're gonna try to throw you out or whatever but so what?
[00:47:56.469 --> 00:47:58.169]  You're just there trying to cover it as a journalist.
[00:47:58.489 --> 00:48:00.090]  They try to act like we're criminals, we're not.
[00:48:03.038 --> 00:48:11.196]  No, I mean, the thing you mentioned before, you know, when Bilderberg was in Watford, they called us all up like three days before, four days before.
[00:48:12.085 --> 00:48:14.226]  And basically made it known that we were on a list.
[00:48:14.306 --> 00:48:19.489]  We wouldn't be allowed to stay in the hotel before, days before Bilderberg even started.
[00:48:19.909 --> 00:48:25.412]  And then the head security guy at the Grove, we asked him directly, you know, why were we kicked out?
[00:48:25.432 --> 00:48:26.993]  And he said, basically, you're on a list.
[00:48:27.053 --> 00:48:30.355]  It's special branch British intelligence that are telling us what to do.
[00:48:30.515 --> 00:48:30.875]  Well, sure.
[00:48:30.915 --> 00:48:31.796]  I mean, they showed up.
[00:48:32.216 --> 00:48:33.397]  They showed up to talk to us too.
[00:48:34.417 --> 00:48:36.978]  Yeah, so I've been on that list since at least 2013.
[00:48:37.039 --> 00:48:41.901]  The thing with the police yesterday, it was definitely odd.
[00:48:41.921 --> 00:48:47.444]  I mean, you know, I was just getting out of the shower, there were two cops in my backyard just walking around.
[00:48:47.464 --> 00:48:58.271]  There's a loud knock at the door, and this policewoman says, and this isn't a hot, you know, early summer's day, I'm airing out the living room, my window's slightly open, and she's like,
[00:48:58.991 --> 00:49:00.393]  Your window was open.
[00:49:00.433 --> 00:49:01.815]  We thought you were being burgled.
[00:49:01.835 --> 00:49:03.277]  I'm like, oh, OK.
[00:49:03.457 --> 00:49:04.759]  And she says, I've shut it now.
[00:49:04.819 --> 00:49:05.460]  It's OK.
[00:49:06.421 --> 00:49:10.006]  And she was like, there are two cops in your backyard looking around as well.
[00:49:10.086 --> 00:49:14.973]  So when they left... Talk about a nanny state where in the summer you can't open your window.
[00:49:16.653 --> 00:49:20.315]  But she said, oh, I've shut your window, and then I looked and she didn't even shut it.
[00:49:20.875 --> 00:49:23.577]  It was just bizarre, because it's never happened before.
[00:49:23.977 --> 00:49:34.783]  You know, it's probably nothing, but as you said, one week before... Oh yeah, we're just on special branch list and, you know, had to meet with all these feds and everything and, you know, had helicopters following us around, but...
[00:49:35.163 --> 00:49:36.384]  But nothing's going on.
[00:49:36.404 --> 00:49:41.108]  I mean, we went to see Stonehenge and had a car following us a hundred miles out of the way.
[00:49:41.128 --> 00:49:43.710]  So, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:44.911]  Everybody knows who we are.
[00:49:45.211 --> 00:49:48.493]  We're journalists who are covering a global event.
[00:49:49.414 --> 00:49:50.114]  It's simple.
[00:49:50.235 --> 00:49:51.516]  We're a known quantity.
[00:49:51.976 --> 00:49:53.017]  It's ridiculous.
[00:49:53.037 --> 00:49:57.000]  But they do all this to play act like journalism is illegal.
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.121]  But see, Paul, how we don't make a big deal out of all this?
[00:49:59.682 --> 00:50:00.642]  It's sensational.
[00:50:01.522 --> 00:50:03.945]  That journalists were put on a special branch list.
[00:50:04.406 --> 00:50:09.613]  I don't think we ever, which is in Interpol as well, I don't think we've ever even talked about this properly.
[00:50:09.913 --> 00:50:11.535]  Why don't you do a story about that?
[00:50:11.635 --> 00:50:18.665]  I mean, our lives are so crazy, we're so used to it, we need to telegraph to people how crazy this is, Paul.
[00:50:19.892 --> 00:50:32.338]  Well, it was basically a violation of the European Human Rights Act because that states you can't be discriminated against based on either gender, sexual preference or philosophy, personal philosophy.
[00:50:32.718 --> 00:50:38.661]  So those gay people who get denied access at hotels and B&Bs, which happen in a couple of cases, they win all their cases.
[00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:41.423]  And I was discriminated against based on my
[00:50:41.983 --> 00:50:42.703]  Philosophy.
[00:50:42.803 --> 00:50:44.884]  They kicked me out based on that solely.
[00:50:44.944 --> 00:50:50.126]  How dare you want to know what a bunch of world leaders are meeting in secret deciding your future and as a journalist want to cover that.
[00:50:50.186 --> 00:50:52.167]  That is just insane.
[00:50:52.207 --> 00:50:55.468]  That's like wanting a big glass of ice water in the Sahara Desert.
[00:50:55.808 --> 00:50:58.929]  That's like wanting to have a ship when you're out in the ocean.
[00:50:58.969 --> 00:51:00.850]  It's like wanting to have air to breathe.
[00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:02.210]  It's so weird.
[00:51:02.871 --> 00:51:05.792]  So weird that we'd want to know what's in the TPP.
[00:51:06.112 --> 00:51:07.252]  So weird.
[00:51:07.892 --> 00:51:09.513]  I mean, it's just, we're weird.
[00:51:10.874 --> 00:51:16.655]  So I say to Market Lunch, look, you know, I keep hearing from the government that, you know, they're worried someday ISIS may get here.
[00:51:16.675 --> 00:51:22.436]  Then I go, duh, Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting, ISIS is already here.
[00:51:22.816 --> 00:51:24.837]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me.
[00:51:24.977 --> 00:51:29.138]  If they don't know ISIS is here already, they got no clue, I'm taking care of myself.
[00:51:29.358 --> 00:51:35.839]  Guns80.com, AR-15 kits, 30 shot magazines, great prices, they've even got the Hillary special.
[00:51:35.899 --> 00:51:37.199]  Guns80.com, that's 844-2Guns80, Guns80.com.

[00:53:39.804 --> 00:53:40.864]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:53:41.044 --> 00:53:45.385]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:53:45.545 --> 00:53:51.106]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:53:51.226 --> 00:53:54.627]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:53:54.787 --> 00:53:57.387]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:53:57.607 --> 00:54:02.348]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:54:02.488 --> 00:54:02.728]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:54:02.768 --> 00:54:04.128]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:54:19.295 --> 00:54:26.621]  During the last few breaks, I was looking over the trade and services agreement from WikiLeaks.
[00:54:27.261 --> 00:54:34.307]  We're talking 100 plus pages in just one of the sections and I was scanning over it.
[00:54:36.129 --> 00:54:36.989]  And it's really bad.
[00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:40.912]  And Forbes has now read it and is pointing out how horrible it is.
[00:54:40.952 --> 00:54:45.056]  But the larger issue is, this is being done in secret.
[00:54:46.317 --> 00:54:47.297]  It's multinational.
[00:54:48.277 --> 00:54:53.998]  The agenda's set by private corporations that are very authoritarian in every aspect.
[00:54:55.519 --> 00:54:57.279]  They're the ones funding the whole globalist agenda.
[00:54:57.319 --> 00:54:59.119]  You name all this bad stuff, they're behind it.
[00:54:59.919 --> 00:55:00.960]  But here's the bigger issue.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:08.441]  They're giving themselves the authority, and this is all written where they may modify it any time they want.
[00:55:10.301 --> 00:55:12.121]  So, it's a tyrannical power grab.
[00:55:12.161 --> 00:55:14.922]  It's kind of like Obamacare was written so open-ended.
[00:55:16.786 --> 00:55:19.428]  And that Obama, hundreds of times, has modified it himself.
[00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:24.452]  It's this process where it's just, they can do whatever they want.
[00:55:26.854 --> 00:55:30.837]  And then they ignore any of the rights that they talk about for the people.
[00:55:31.678 --> 00:55:39.424]  Paul Watson, we're sending in Josh and Rob Dew.
[00:55:40.605 --> 00:55:41.966]  They're going out there Sunday.
[00:55:41.986 --> 00:55:44.969]  They should be in and around the area by Monday.
[00:55:46.019 --> 00:55:49.301]  I don't want to really get into when you're going, but I think you should go sooner rather than later.
[00:55:50.962 --> 00:55:53.763]  Because we really need to get shots inside that hotel and stuff.
[00:55:54.203 --> 00:55:57.325]  Plus, we have one of their online magazines, you can see what it looks like.
[00:55:57.365 --> 00:56:05.109]  But I like to get in beforehand, so I'd like to tell you, you're a lot closer, I think you should just leave tomorrow.
[00:56:06.159 --> 00:56:07.260]  But I'll call you after the show today.
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:10.722]  I've gotten so busy, I haven't really pre-planned a lot of this with you, as I should have.
[00:56:11.122 --> 00:56:15.485]  But the bigger issue is, we have sources, plus we have statements by Bilderberg members in public.
[00:56:15.866 --> 00:56:17.587]  We know what their agenda is going to be.
[00:56:19.488 --> 00:56:24.672]  I need to call you with some of the intel I've gotten from one of my big sources, but I know you have one of those same sources.
[00:56:26.313 --> 00:56:35.179]  You're planning Monday, you think, is the best time to release the Bilderberg agenda, and then I guess Thursday, they'll probably release their spun version on their website.
[00:56:35.239 --> 00:56:35.559]  Right, Paul?
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:44.949]  Yeah, they always release bullet points which provide no substance whatsoever, very vague generic information which could be about anything.
[00:56:45.209 --> 00:56:51.716]  So they don't really release their minutes or anything detailed, so they just do that to say, oh look, we're being transparent when it's basically nothing.
[00:56:52.156 --> 00:56:57.322]  The key intel always comes out before or immediately after the conference, so that's what we'll be talking about.
[00:56:59.989 --> 00:57:01.330]  Other points so far.
[00:57:01.550 --> 00:57:04.831]  I mean, it's in the Austrian news already, some of the points we already knew.
[00:57:04.971 --> 00:57:18.637]  Open borders, making Europe, bringing all these immigrants, getting rid of borders, making us do it, make us all pay for it, more social manipulation, getting rid of cash, doing bail-ins, doing a hundred trillion dollar per decade global carbon tax.
[00:57:19.437 --> 00:57:23.499]  What are some of the other things we know already are going to be on the agenda that you're going to be fleshing out on Monday?
[00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:32.492]  Well, the Agenda 21 thing is going to be big, despite the fact they keep getting caught in all these faux pas on the environment.
[00:57:32.932 --> 00:57:34.433]  You know, not just Climategate.
[00:57:34.473 --> 00:57:36.733]  Almost every single month we have a new scandal.
[00:57:37.254 --> 00:57:48.297]  They're still pushing this 80% carbon tax reduction, which will basically cripple Western economies and turn everybody into, you know, serfs for central banks to an even greater extent.
[00:57:48.537 --> 00:57:49.877]  Cripple's not strong enough.
[00:57:49.937 --> 00:57:51.158]  It will end civilization.
[00:57:52.162 --> 00:57:53.182]  Yeah, basically.
[00:57:53.722 --> 00:58:05.646]  The French Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius, came out on Monday, and he is a Bilderberg member, and said, look, this is not going to get past Congress, this Agenda 21, 80% carbon reduction.
[00:58:06.166 --> 00:58:20.290]  We're going to bypass Congress, we're going to make the Obama administration, in concert with the UN, force this into being, so they're going to use outright dictatorship to force this eco-tyranny into existence, or at least going to try that.
[00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:22.612]  And that's what it's going to be about.
[00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:34.303]  They're also going to be talking about the global political awakening, which the big new Brzezinski talked about, you know, four or five years ago now, because we're already seeing the consequences of that with these riots.
[00:58:34.403 --> 00:58:40.669]  That's why they're trying to hijack groups like Black Lives Matter, because they know that this resentment is going to build.
[00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.850]  Stay there, Paul.
[00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:43.131]  Do five more minutes with us.
[00:58:43.151 --> 00:58:49.939]  I'm gonna come right back and have you get more into the agenda on Bilderberg, the folks behind the TPP, and everything else straight ahead.
[00:58:49.959 --> 00:58:51.601]  A window into the shadow government.
[00:58:51.961 --> 00:58:52.442]  Stay with us.
[00:58:52.462 --> 00:58:55.545]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:00.709 --> 00:59:05.452]  Alex Jones here with Infowarslife.com Consumer Alert Report.
[00:59:05.872 --> 00:59:12.917]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[00:59:13.197 --> 00:59:20.962]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:59:21.282 --> 00:59:22.283]  The bad news is
[00:59:22.603 --> 00:59:29.890]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at InfoWarsLife.com of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine are running low.
[00:59:30.291 --> 00:59:34.695]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these Deep Earth Crystals.
[00:59:35.096 --> 00:59:42.263]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:42.463 --> 00:59:45.346]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[00:59:45.566 --> 00:59:52.272]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[00:59:52.552 --> 00:59:56.776]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:59:56.816 --> 00:59:59.358]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:14.961 --> 01:00:18.444]  It was easier to control a million people, literally.
[01:00:18.884 --> 01:00:26.829]  It was easier to control a million people than physically to kill a million people.
[01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:32.734]  Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control.
[01:00:42.031 --> 01:00:43.672]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:50.336]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:53.878 --> 01:01:02.863]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA Region 6 in occupied North America.
[01:01:06.254 --> 01:01:13.098]  Paul Watson, I've been ranting here, I just cannot get over the awakening that's happening, but for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[01:01:13.538 --> 01:01:14.319]  That goes both ways.
[01:01:14.359 --> 01:01:24.885]  The establishment is just speeding up, ramping up everything they're doing, and they're just trying, I guess, to create learned helplessness to acclimate us to all this.
[01:01:25.446 --> 01:01:31.730]  How do you think that's going, A, and then B, finish up on some more of the agenda that we've ferreted out from our sources?
[01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:39.987]  And then confirmed, as we double-check our sources, that the very Bilderberg Group members are actually making a lot of these statements in public.
[01:01:40.027 --> 01:01:42.853]  I mean, they're such nakedly totalitarian.
[01:01:44.815 --> 01:02:01.663]  Yeah, that's what they're saying about, you know, the agenda to ban cash, forcing everyone to have a government-controlled bank account because they want to keep interest rates low and they know that everybody's increasingly going to pull their money out of the bank, so they want to force people to keep their money in the banks and then regulate it that way.
[01:02:02.183 --> 01:02:04.044]  They're also, you know, outright
[01:02:04.764 --> 01:02:06.686]  Creating class warfare.
[01:02:07.067 --> 01:02:12.272]  George Soros said that class warfare and riots were coming back in 2012.
[01:02:13.133 --> 01:02:19.920]  Now he's funding Black Lives Matter, which is driving a lot of that, because it's been hijacked and steered towards racial division.
[01:02:21.051 --> 01:02:24.034]  Since, you know, last year, to the tune of $33 million.
[01:02:24.294 --> 01:02:31.240]  And meanwhile, you know, the elite are buying all these safe rooms, they're buying remote property in New Zealand.
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:45.892]  They're saying, because of things like Ferguson, they're concerned about societal breakdown and disorder, while themselves creating it with the proven method of wealth inequality and this drop in real wages.
[01:02:46.853 --> 01:02:50.377]  As the worldwide inflation spikes through endless money printing.
[01:02:50.778 --> 01:02:56.684]  Those factors always create class warfare, riots, and domestic civil unrest.
[01:02:56.764 --> 01:03:02.131]  So, they're, you know, they're mixing the ingredients to a tea and they know what the final product's gonna be.
[01:03:02.651 --> 01:03:08.877]  They're bailing out, they're getting their safe rooms and their remote property, while the middle class are going to be squeezed in the middle.
[01:03:08.937 --> 01:03:12.540]  It's the whole pressure from above, pressure from below concept.
[01:03:13.001 --> 01:03:25.593]  So I'm sure that will be covered at Bilderberg this year, that whole class warfare, wealth inequality, powder keg that's set to explode and already has to a great extent with Ferguson and Baltimore.
[01:03:27.213 --> 01:03:29.534]  Let me shift gears into another subject and get your take on it.
[01:03:30.074 --> 01:03:30.914]  I went back and looked.
[01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:35.596]  WikiLeaks claimed that they had the whole TPP but only released the internet section.
[01:03:36.056 --> 01:03:38.136]  Then they were saying, oh, we don't have it.
[01:03:38.196 --> 01:03:40.317]  Then I made a big deal about it on Sunday and Monday.
[01:03:40.337 --> 01:03:43.498]  I'm not saying that we caused it, but we might have put pressure on them.
[01:03:43.778 --> 01:03:44.798]  I'm sure other people were too.
[01:03:45.459 --> 01:03:52.961]  So now they've released another section saying, oh, we had a fundraiser, a bounty for it, but I guess it's a bounty to get them to release it.
[01:03:54.241 --> 01:03:55.062]  You've researched this.
[01:03:55.102 --> 01:03:56.182]  What's really going on there?
[01:03:58.154 --> 01:04:17.008]  Well, I think a lot of the conservative support for it, which you've seen in Congress, is because of the false belief that, you know, this will somehow allow smaller businesses in America to sue the government if the government imposes some kind of, you know, BS environmental regulation that puts them out of business.
[01:04:17.088 --> 01:04:20.151]  When, if you read into it, it doesn't allow that at all.
[01:04:20.211 --> 01:04:26.816]  It's all about this corporate fascism, this revolving door between the huge megacorporations and government.
[01:04:27.336 --> 01:04:30.278]  Allowing them to impinge on sovereignty.
[01:04:30.298 --> 01:04:33.080]  It's got nothing to do with the small businesses in America.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.882]  So that's why it's got a lot of misguided conservative support.
[01:04:38.543 --> 01:04:40.204]  Paul Joseph Watson's our guest.
[01:04:40.705 --> 01:04:45.388]  I need to call you right after the show today at two o'clock central for some planning sessions.
[01:04:45.828 --> 01:04:54.534]  Because Bilderberg is upon us yet again and I've got to figure out how to get you some information because I know you're being watched that I don't want them to have.
[01:04:57.970 --> 01:04:58.791]  For your security.
[01:04:59.172 --> 01:05:02.175]  So I'll be calling you today at about two central, okay?
[01:05:03.056 --> 01:05:03.396]  Okay.
[01:05:04.177 --> 01:05:09.663]  Paul Watson from InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, our European correspondent.
[01:05:10.624 --> 01:05:13.748]  Just passed by Congress, the USA Freedom Act.
[01:05:14.858 --> 01:05:19.182]  Well, not real freedom, but the kind of freedom we act like we have in the USA.
[01:05:19.903 --> 01:05:22.065]  Think of it as CISPA for phone companies.
[01:05:22.525 --> 01:05:27.770]  A kind of cozy, symbiotic relationship between the corporate oligarchy and the authoritarian government.
[01:05:29.969 --> 01:05:34.431]  The phone companies will now store your info and pass it on to the paranoid government on demand.
[01:05:35.011 --> 01:05:37.732]  And the phone companies will be granted freedom from liability.
[01:05:38.092 --> 01:05:39.613]  Now that's real freedom.
[01:05:39.993 --> 01:05:41.773]  The kind only the big guys get.
[01:05:42.134 --> 01:05:42.834]  Yeah.
[01:05:42.914 --> 01:05:43.834]  But wait, there's more.
[01:05:44.394 --> 01:05:51.517]  Now Congress will be notified whenever the secret FISA court, well it's not really a court, just a single judge, reinterprets the law.
[01:05:53.518 --> 01:05:54.038]  That's great.
[01:05:54.821 --> 01:05:57.765]  Because they've been changing the law and not even telling us.
[01:05:58.106 --> 01:05:59.327]  Now they're going to let us know.
[01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:01.510]  Isn't America great?
[01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:03.633]  The USA Freedom Act.
[01:06:04.495 --> 01:06:05.015]  Offer void.
[01:06:05.055 --> 01:06:06.077]  We're prohibited by law.
[01:06:06.978 --> 01:06:08.941]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:06:10.419 --> 01:06:15.443]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[01:06:41.341 --> 01:06:50.387]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.

[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.501]  Another major health threat.
[01:07:11.521 --> 01:07:16.422]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:07:16.502 --> 01:07:19.123]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:07:19.163 --> 01:07:25.946]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:07:26.206 --> 01:07:29.067]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:07:29.207 --> 01:07:32.128]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:34.149]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:07:34.169 --> 01:07:37.010]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:42.595]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:07:42.815 --> 01:07:46.318]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:07:46.338 --> 01:07:49.320]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:56.526]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:08:06.394 --> 01:08:08.254]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:08:08.414 --> 01:08:15.256]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:15.856 --> 01:08:18.697]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.517 --> 01:08:23.918]  Obama trade, global access to citizens' data.
[01:08:24.098 --> 01:08:29.219]  As Boehner works to give Obama even more secret powers.
[01:08:32.748 --> 01:08:41.958]  To pass any legislation he wants globally, I guess treaties you could call it, outside of Congress's authority.
[01:08:44.861 --> 01:08:51.728]  And it's also being reported that under the new provisions of the TPP that's been leaked by WikiLeaks,
[01:08:55.612 --> 01:09:04.594]  The deal stops countries from saying where your data goes and lets them to share all your personal data and also spy on internet users.
[01:09:04.654 --> 01:09:09.135]  So it's basically legalizing global NSA type garbage.
[01:09:12.036 --> 01:09:13.036]  Simply amazing.
[01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:14.536]  Unprecedented.
[01:09:21.438 --> 01:09:22.158]  Continuing.
[01:09:23.817 --> 01:09:29.843]  Kids abused, choked and beaten in dark rooms at police leadership camp.
[01:09:31.665 --> 01:09:34.628]  So they're teaching brutality and torture.
[01:09:34.648 --> 01:09:36.190]  They call it a pain compliance.
[01:09:37.711 --> 01:09:46.040]  Off-grid kids still in state custody one month later even though in court the family was exonerated and they said give them their kids back.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:54.244]  Well yeah, Obama ignores court rulings on NSA spying that's illegal.
[01:09:55.545 --> 01:09:57.326]  Or when courts say you can't have open borders.
[01:09:59.407 --> 01:10:04.711]  And I want to cover this later, slacktivist Susan Sarandon is too lazy to wear an anti-gun t-shirt.
[01:10:06.055 --> 01:10:09.216]  That's what this Wear Orange Day that Google and others have been promoting is about.
[01:10:10.176 --> 01:10:12.737]  Where you wear orange for gun victims, as if guns.
[01:10:13.177 --> 01:10:16.878]  How about you wear pink for people run over by cars, and we blame cars.
[01:10:17.159 --> 01:10:18.639]  How about people driving cars?
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:25.361]  But that ties into other Hollywood folks showing that they're starting to wake up.
[01:10:25.941 --> 01:10:30.983]  John Cusack says that Obama is far worse than Obama, close quote.
[01:10:34.264 --> 01:10:42.146]  Liberal professor vilified as racist for accurately outing activists, for actively quoting activists.
[01:10:42.786 --> 01:10:45.947]  I'm a liberal professor and my liberal students terrify me.
[01:10:47.787 --> 01:10:49.187]  It's an article I'm going to break down later.
[01:10:49.207 --> 01:10:55.849]  I just so happen to run into a mainstream Chinese newspaper in English article.
[01:10:55.869 --> 01:10:58.609]  In fact, I think I IMed it to Nico.
[01:10:58.629 --> 01:11:00.510]  Or maybe I forgot.
[01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:01.090]  I don't remember.
[01:11:02.105 --> 01:11:18.117]  And it was a high-level Communist Party official apologizing and being praised by the Communist Party of China for renouncing Communists during the Cultural Revolution, like her school principal, and killing him with a group of Red Guard.
[01:11:20.418 --> 01:11:29.205]  And Red Guard in Communist systems, North Korea, Communist China, you name it, are youth brigades of high school and college people that go out and just viciously murder people.
[01:11:30.734 --> 01:11:33.255]  And so, that's why psychos around the U.S.
[01:11:33.275 --> 01:11:39.336]  and the world say they're part of the Red Guard, and it's a fantasy of young people rising up and, you know, killing old people.
[01:11:40.076 --> 01:11:41.776]  Or killing anybody they want, basically.
[01:11:43.477 --> 01:11:51.298]  And it's just so sick that you have people praising the Red Guard in the United States, and the Red Guard coming after us, pathetically.
[01:11:52.338 --> 01:11:53.119]  They can hardly walk.
[01:11:56.499 --> 01:11:59.620]  But, um, the Red Guard
[01:12:02.466 --> 01:12:02.646]  I think?
[01:12:19.256 --> 01:12:26.059]  I mean, if you go to Nordstrom's or you go to, you know, trendy restaurants, they'll have plates with Mao on it for rich people to come eat on.
[01:12:26.299 --> 01:12:41.926]  It's just flirting with total death, flirting with disaster, only in a rich, decadent, wealthy nation could yuppies' children run around fantasizing about how they're going to run around killing a bunch of people.
[01:12:43.167 --> 01:12:47.209]  That's not going to work in the same way here in the United States, I hope you know.
[01:12:49.138 --> 01:12:58.642]  We're not poor disarmed Chinese peasants that can be fed on by a pack of middle class and upper middle class kids.
[01:12:59.202 --> 01:13:03.643]  Because that's who the Red Guard was in China, was just the spoiled, rotten Communist Party kids.
[01:13:04.964 --> 01:13:07.505]  Who now are billionaires and rule.
[01:13:07.525 --> 01:13:10.166]  It's totally sick.
[01:13:10.746 --> 01:13:12.106]  But at the end of the day, that's what it is.
[01:13:12.287 --> 01:13:15.868]  It's a fantasy of seizing power by nothings.
[01:13:17.383 --> 01:13:19.844]  Who come from nothing and who will never be anything.
[01:13:22.645 --> 01:13:37.609]  I wanted to get Dr. Group on about this article that people also like when he was on two weeks ago and we had the Ask Dr. Group a question on supplements, on cleaning up your body, on detoxing, something that he harps on a lot.
[01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:39.010]  It's out of the Daily Mail today.
[01:13:40.177 --> 01:13:45.321]  Exposure to common household pesticides triples boy's risk of ADHD.
[01:13:45.861 --> 01:13:47.842]  Really, you mean bug poison might not be good for you?
[01:13:48.723 --> 01:13:56.568]  Experts warn, a pesticide found in common household products has been found to triple boy's risk of being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
[01:13:56.889 --> 01:13:59.350]  Yeah, roaches run around at first when you spray them with poison too.
[01:14:00.131 --> 01:14:08.337]  Scientists have warned, symptoms of the condition, notably hyperactivity and impulsive activity, have found to be associated with exposure to
[01:14:09.721 --> 01:14:17.866]  Pyrethroid pesticides, which is one of the most common ones that comes from a flower in South Africa that they claim is pretty safe.
[01:14:20.528 --> 01:14:21.388]  Chrysanthemum, yeah.
[01:14:21.689 --> 01:14:28.493]  Look, I'm not stupid, but my dad would tell me when I was, you know, 10, 11, 12 years old, or even younger, take the dogs out and give them a bath.
[01:14:28.533 --> 01:14:29.233]  They got fleas.
[01:14:30.434 --> 01:14:34.236]  And I remember I'd wash them with pyrethrin soap.
[01:14:35.397 --> 01:14:37.999]  And I remember getting higher than a kite.
[01:14:39.906 --> 01:14:44.489]  But my dad was a smart guy, but he kind of went with the system that pyrethrins are safe for humans.
[01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:46.311]  No, I should have been wearing gloves.
[01:14:47.151 --> 01:14:55.277]  And I'd get it all over me and I'd be back there, you know, on the porch or the front yard, out there with the water hose, washing the dogs, scrubbing them, everything.
[01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:56.778]  That was one of my chores.
[01:14:57.239 --> 01:15:00.301]  Mowing the lawn, carrying out the trash, helping him to clean out the gutters.
[01:15:01.522 --> 01:15:04.504]  Now kids just watch television and dream of being in the Red Guards, but
[01:15:08.217 --> 01:15:10.799]  Can't wait for Red Terror to be carried out on Jones.
[01:15:10.859 --> 01:15:11.739]  Yeah, man.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:13.861]  Can't wait to kill him.
[01:15:13.881 --> 01:15:22.666]  That might be easier than you think, actually.
[01:15:25.468 --> 01:15:27.449]  Then you're going to get locked up in a Supermax prison.
[01:15:29.811 --> 01:15:33.153]  But continuing here, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:36.323]  This is what we're talking about.
[01:15:36.683 --> 01:15:42.765]  And you add thousands of chemicals and the stuff that's in the clothes and everything, that's why we got a whacked out society.
[01:15:43.585 --> 01:15:46.406]  The elite are whacked out because they're inbred, decadent, out of their minds.
[01:15:46.886 --> 01:15:48.346]  History shows that happens over and over again.
[01:15:48.866 --> 01:15:56.008]  So Dr. Group, InfoWarsLife.com's main advisor and quality control officer, Army Special Ops veteran.
[01:15:56.708 --> 01:15:58.569]  He's got a whole bunch of nutritionist degrees.
[01:16:00.169 --> 01:16:02.811]  Alternative medicine degrees, a chiropractor as well.
[01:16:02.851 --> 01:16:05.794]  I won't go over his amazing background, but he's really a smart guy.
[01:16:05.834 --> 01:16:11.078]  We have medical doctors that advise us as well, and my dad's a chemist, and other things he advises him for is life.com.
[01:16:11.639 --> 01:16:16.383]  But he's pioneered a lot of the research that's cutting edge out there today.
[01:16:17.223 --> 01:16:21.887]  And of course, it's mirrored by a lot of the research of Dr. Blaylock, who is, of course, a retired brain surgeon.
[01:16:22.648 --> 01:16:25.170]  But here we are, going over all this today.
[01:16:25.530 --> 01:16:27.171]  Dr. Group, what should we hit first?
[01:16:27.231 --> 01:16:39.481]  I mean, I know you've got an agenda of stuff you want to cover and take calls at the bottom of the hour, but every time you come in, you harp on what's under the kitchen cabinet or what these flour extracts are doing.
[01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:42.984]  What is your overall view on this situation?
[01:16:44.338 --> 01:16:54.968]  Well, I've been saying for a long time, you know, addressing the root cause of disease is one thing, and really, when you look at the pharmaceutical companies, there's two branches.
[01:16:55.248 --> 01:17:01.213]  One branch is disease management, and the other branch is mental illness creation and management.
[01:17:01.854 --> 01:17:08.180]  And all of them, whether it's ADD, ADHD, depression, anxiety, bipolar, schizophrenia,
[01:17:08.861 --> 01:17:13.212]  All of that's caused by too many chemicals coming in and not enough coming out.
[01:17:13.232 --> 01:17:13.954]  And folks knew that.
[01:17:13.994 --> 01:17:16.801]  They used to say Matt is a hatter for folks that worked around Mercury.
[01:17:17.648 --> 01:17:18.508]  Right, right.
[01:17:19.129 --> 01:17:32.155]  So again, you know, it's the medical profession and the pharmaceutical companies creating illnesses and creating conditions, and they're saying it's a chemical imbalance in the brain, but it's really chemical toxicity in the brain.
[01:17:32.716 --> 01:17:44.682]  That's why 3,000 people a month die from psychiatric medications, and that's why our children are being medicated now, because it's an easy way to put people on medications for the rest of their life.
[01:17:44.722 --> 01:17:46.083]  They're even trying to diagnose
[01:17:47.323 --> 01:17:50.745]  Uh, children in the womb with bipolar disease right now.
[01:17:50.805 --> 01:17:56.087]  They want every single person from the age of one on some medication for life.
[01:17:56.347 --> 01:17:59.049]  There's four-year-olds that have attempted suicide.
[01:17:59.089 --> 01:18:04.051]  There's five-year-olds that have actually committed suicide because of the, the anti-psychotics.
[01:18:04.111 --> 01:18:11.715]  But that's okay, because the federal initiative that's ten years old is called the New Freedom Initiative, which admits its goal is to basically drug everybody.
[01:18:12.495 --> 01:18:18.965]  It's interim goal is by 2015, I guess that's this year, to have half the kids in the country on a psychiatric drug.
[01:18:18.985 --> 01:18:21.008]  They haven't reached that yet, but they're working towards it.
[01:18:22.247 --> 01:18:35.372]  Right, and if you leave a psychiatrist's office without a prescription, there's even a mental disorder for that, where they can put on your record that you left without a prescription and you have mental illness because you left.
[01:18:35.432 --> 01:18:39.633]  So, yes, they want to lay, it's the labeling of the new society.
[01:18:39.753 --> 01:18:46.796]  So in the future, they can take your rights away from you because you're mentally unstable and you have some form of mental disorder, whether it's
[01:18:47.296 --> 01:18:53.806]  ADD, ADHD, whether it's a phobia, biting your fingernails, eating organic food, it doesn't matter.
[01:18:53.847 --> 01:18:55.329]  Not trusting the government.
[01:18:55.469 --> 01:18:58.834]  I mean, they're creating scores of new mental illnesses every year.
[01:18:59.946 --> 01:19:06.771]  Right, well the DSM-5 now has over 400 mental illnesses in it, and it's just getting worse and worse and worse.
[01:19:06.831 --> 01:19:14.477]  And not only that, but the psychiatric medications, most of them contain fluoride, which calcifies the pineal gland, demotivates you.
[01:19:15.278 --> 01:19:23.244]  We're really, what's happening is turning people into zombies, and we're not creating geniuses again like we used to.
[01:19:24.185 --> 01:19:34.530]  Most of the world's best geniuses, Einstein, Sir Isaac Newton, all of those individuals would have been labeled with learning disabilities and put on some sort of medication.
[01:19:34.570 --> 01:19:48.717]  So it's the dumbing down with the inclusion of the vaccinations and all the other chemicals and toxins like what you were talking about earlier in the home and in the environment, in the schools, in the workplace that people and children are being exposed to.
[01:19:48.757 --> 01:19:51.979]  And the children are just a lot more sensitive to it than the adults.
[01:19:53.139 --> 01:19:59.465]  Well, I remember when I would use pyrethrin-based stuff, I would get hyper, I would get sped up from it.
[01:19:59.525 --> 01:20:09.494]  I mean, I just remember feeling weird after I would wash the dogs, and then now here it is, just admitted, and they said it was totally safe for humans to be around, but of course we know that's not true.
[01:20:11.075 --> 01:20:14.096]  Did you know some countries are now banning GMO foods?
[01:20:14.456 --> 01:20:14.996]  It's true.
[01:20:15.276 --> 01:20:19.176]  That's why for quality storable foods, you need Ready Made Resources.

[01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:13.351]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:14.092 --> 01:22:14.592]  It's true.
[01:22:14.712 --> 01:22:18.653]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:18.873 --> 01:22:20.714]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:21.254 --> 01:22:25.716]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:26.036 --> 01:22:38.643]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[01:23:09.592 --> 01:23:11.294]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:23:11.514 --> 01:23:14.837]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:16.138]  A pair of scissors.
[01:23:16.498 --> 01:23:22.002]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[01:23:22.303 --> 01:23:26.967]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:23:27.227 --> 01:23:28.047]  The phone line.
[01:23:28.208 --> 01:23:33.132]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:23:33.472 --> 01:23:37.215]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:23:37.355 --> 01:23:40.238]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[01:23:40.679 --> 01:23:42.941]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[01:23:43.142 --> 01:23:47.347]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.

[01:24:15.568 --> 01:24:17.109]  Our difference lives on.
[01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:20.552]  We've got more info on Fukushima coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:21.193 --> 01:24:33.425]  I also want to get into a BizPak review where the former psychiatric head of John Hopkins has come out and said that this whole move for men to be women and women to be men is a psychiatric illness.
[01:24:34.585 --> 01:24:43.633]  Well, I know that they call it disabling yourself a new right to chop your arms and legs off.
[01:24:44.494 --> 01:24:45.535]  And they have a term for that.
[01:24:45.575 --> 01:24:47.357]  We're going to talk about that coming up in a moment.
[01:24:47.377 --> 01:24:50.079]  But how much of it is chemical manipulation?
[01:24:50.099 --> 01:24:52.621]  We'll talk about that with Dr. Group in the next segment.
[01:24:53.002 --> 01:24:55.244]  And we'll take some of your questions if you'd like to call.
[01:24:55.644 --> 01:24:56.204]  The number is 800-259-9231.
[01:25:00.328 --> 01:25:01.308]  Ask Dr. Group, 800-259-9231.
[01:25:01.368 --> 01:25:04.890]  Oh, and first-time callers, I want to give them a chance today.
[01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:05.090]  800-259-9231.
[01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:06.350]  Again, please be a first-time caller.
[01:25:06.370 --> 01:25:06.430]  800-259-9231.
[01:25:06.450 --> 01:25:07.231]  But look at these headlines.
[01:25:07.251 --> 01:25:09.191]  Ray Kurzweil, humans will be hybrids by 2030.
[01:25:09.311 --> 01:25:10.772]  That's Google's main futurist.
[01:25:29.198 --> 01:25:29.839]  Daily Mail.
[01:25:29.979 --> 01:25:32.261]  World's first bio-limb created.
[01:25:32.781 --> 01:25:34.823]  Dead arm brought back to life in the lab.
[01:25:35.143 --> 01:25:37.385]  Could allow amputees to grow replacement limbs.
[01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:45.192]  Google founder defends accident record of self-driving cars as another one rear-ends somebody.
[01:25:48.515 --> 01:25:50.236]  And Google, of course, is defending itself.
[01:25:51.597 --> 01:25:53.559]  Facebook addiction linked to depression.
[01:25:53.579 --> 01:25:54.600]  Reuters is reporting.
[01:25:55.433 --> 01:25:59.094]  Oh yeah, video game playing linked to lower IQ and brain damage.
[01:25:59.955 --> 01:26:03.276]  And here's another headline, BPA still widespread in cans.
[01:26:03.356 --> 01:26:10.118]  So, we've had a victory in the BPA that Dr. Group's dad was involved in inventing, a famous chemist.
[01:26:12.519 --> 01:26:19.822]  We've had victory in getting it removed some places, and they act like they're removing it, but then they just come right back with it.
[01:26:20.663 --> 01:26:22.084]  So the fight is still ongoing.
[01:26:22.504 --> 01:26:25.327]  I just threw out a whole smattering of articles there in this short segment.
[01:26:25.627 --> 01:26:27.528]  Which one of those you want to tackle first, Dr. Group?
[01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:45.763]  Well, you know, you were talking about the transgender and I mean it doesn't matter what it is, whether it's a mental illness or a degenerative disease, it's all caused by the accumulation of chemicals and the whole transgender situation that's going on is really
[01:26:46.483 --> 01:27:02.854]  Because we have too many chemicals that are in the water and the food and they're getting into the system and creating excess estrogen because they're endocrine disrupting chemicals which disrupt your endocrine glands and your endocrine glands are what regulates and secretes your hormones and
[01:27:03.454 --> 01:27:21.018]  What that does is it decreases fertility, it causes you to become sterile, and these are all things like BPA, dioxins, BPS, the atrazine, phthalates, perchlorate, fire retardants, even lead, mercury, arsenic, all of these things that we're exposed to.
[01:27:21.038 --> 01:27:22.759]  Well explain it to me how BPA...
[01:27:23.879 --> 01:27:37.528]  From just the research I've looked at, it's mainline science, makes females more female, male more feminine, causes women to degenerate in their breasts and other sexual tissues, makes girls go into puberty earlier.
[01:27:38.428 --> 01:27:43.512]  So it's all feminizing, they know it's doing this, and then they argue, oh, it's a mental illness.
[01:27:44.784 --> 01:27:48.486]  I'm not a big researcher like you are, but I've done scientific research.
[01:27:48.566 --> 01:27:50.007]  My dad has done research.
[01:27:50.987 --> 01:28:02.793]  I mean, I know that in the embryo of fish, in the embryo of mammals, in the embryo of amphibians, we're going to come back from break, because that's what I wanted to address this in full.
[01:28:03.943 --> 01:28:13.005]  That chemicals do change, and from what I've read, I mean, aren't embryos, when they're really small, more female than male, and they change into male?
[01:28:13.025 --> 01:28:20.787]  I mean, I'm saying that as a layman there, and that these chemicals basically do develop more feminine-type traits in brain tissue.
[01:28:20.807 --> 01:28:22.307]  And then I see the comments on InfoWars.
[01:28:22.667 --> 01:28:23.528]  No, that's not true.
[01:28:23.548 --> 01:28:24.648]  You're either male or female.
[01:28:25.388 --> 01:28:41.741]  So I think there's an argument that some of this could be natural, some of it not, but I mean, I know that chemicals are making male fish female, and male frogs female, or hermaphrodites, so the folks that are on InfoWars commenting saying I'm wrong, aren't they wrong?
[01:28:41.761 --> 01:28:47.005]  I mean, I'm going to go back into the science and do a whole report on this, proving it to them, but I mean, isn't that mainline science?
[01:28:48.385 --> 01:28:52.228]  It is mainline science, and there's plenty of research out there to back it up.
[01:28:52.288 --> 01:29:02.655]  I mean, BPA is really just a xenoestrogen, and a xenoestrogen is a type of xenohormone, or artificial hormone, that imitates estrogen.
[01:29:03.595 --> 01:29:08.719]  And, I mean, everything plastic these days contains BPA, the inside of cans.
[01:29:08.759 --> 01:29:12.922]  And just because they said that BPA was taken out of baby bottles,
[01:29:13.462 --> 01:29:15.764]  That's pretty much the only thing that BPA was taking out.
[01:29:15.784 --> 01:29:19.106]  It's still in the liners of the microwavable, so you just cook it into your food.
[01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:24.451]  Yeah, and what happens is the body identifies BPA as the real thing.
[01:29:24.571 --> 01:29:27.413]  It thinks the BPA is actually estrogen.
[01:29:27.933 --> 01:29:33.878]  So what you're having is hormone replacement therapy, courtesy of the government, on every single person.
[01:29:33.898 --> 01:29:37.381]  So it's like a man that chooses to be a woman, taking it to become a tranny.
[01:29:38.061 --> 01:29:46.846]  Yeah, because your body behaves like it's loaded with estrogen, and that affects fertility, breast health, you can grow breasts... Does it affect sexual persuasion?
[01:29:48.027 --> 01:29:49.027]  Absolutely, it does.
[01:29:49.087 --> 01:29:54.070]  In the brain, especially for the pregnant mother, and these are all documented studies... You know, I want to do this.
[01:29:54.130 --> 01:29:58.853]  I want to get you to town with the studies and do a whole hour special on this, because I'm sick of folks saying it in trade.
[01:29:58.873 --> 01:29:59.313]  We'll be back.
[01:29:59.993 --> 01:30:00.894]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.394 --> 01:30:02.995]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.935 --> 01:30:06.617]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.703 --> 01:30:18.246]  Despite this administration's dedication to transparency, FOIA backlogs have soared since President Barack Obama took office in 2009.
[01:30:18.786 --> 01:30:24.128]  A spike in requests is to be expected in an administration plagued with scandal.
[01:30:24.408 --> 01:30:36.592]  After it was revealed that they'd singled out conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status, the IRS cost the taxpayers $20 million so they could hand over more than a million pages of documents to investigators.
[01:30:36.772 --> 01:30:39.315]  And that doesn't even include Lois Lerner's emails.
[01:30:39.615 --> 01:30:48.424]  Speaking of missing emails, the House GOP has threatened to block some State Department funding until officials speed up their response to FOIA requests.
[01:30:48.704 --> 01:30:53.409]  The State Department responded saying the funding cut would only further cripple its efforts.
[01:30:53.729 --> 01:30:57.971]  After all, it's not just the Benghazi scandal and Hillary's email practices.
[01:30:58.091 --> 01:31:07.134]  The state's also dealing with massive FOIA requests for how contributions to the Clinton Foundation may or may not have influenced Clinton on the job.
[01:31:07.474 --> 01:31:10.055]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[01:31:10.583 --> 01:31:11.463]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:31:11.503 --> 01:31:11.924]  Good, brother.
[01:31:12.084 --> 01:31:13.764]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:31:13.804 --> 01:31:15.585]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:31:15.745 --> 01:31:19.767]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:31:19.787 --> 01:31:20.507]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:31:20.528 --> 01:31:24.649]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:31:24.809 --> 01:31:32.673]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:31:32.873 --> 01:31:36.095]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:31:36.236 --> 01:31:37.737]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:31:37.777 --> 01:31:40.659]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:31:40.799 --> 01:31:42.180]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:47.824]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[01:31:47.924 --> 01:31:49.144]  We're good to go.
[01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:15.494]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[01:32:41.355 --> 01:32:50.498]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:32:50.638 --> 01:32:54.140]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[01:33:22.645 --> 01:33:24.766]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:25.226 --> 01:33:26.606]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.807 --> 01:33:39.793]  Robert, Dave, Mike, Jim, Christian and others, we're going to be going to your phone calls, your questions for Dr. Group here in about 10 minutes or so, but Dr. Group,
[01:33:42.244 --> 01:33:48.106]  Pulling back, I read the news seven days a week, and I've just seen countless studies.
[01:33:48.647 --> 01:33:49.347]  We've covered them.
[01:33:50.607 --> 01:33:51.828]  I do want to do a special report.
[01:33:51.868 --> 01:34:05.153]  We show all these studies, but I want you to talk about it some, because I've got a report here where former John Hopkins, chief of psychiatry, says being transgender is a mental disorder, biologically impossible.
[01:34:06.674 --> 01:34:08.515]  Well, I think it's a perfect storm of things.
[01:34:09.574 --> 01:34:14.918]  You've got it in the education system being pushed to balkanize and change society.
[01:34:15.899 --> 01:34:22.623]  As societies get older and more decadent, as empires get more decadent, this always happens.
[01:34:23.044 --> 01:34:24.505]  People just want to try different things.
[01:34:26.686 --> 01:34:29.548]  But the chemicals being added supercharges it.
[01:34:30.609 --> 01:34:31.970]  That's what they do.
[01:34:32.951 --> 01:34:35.573]  That's the effects it has on amphibians, fish, and other mammals.
[01:34:35.593 --> 01:34:38.375]  You give them estrogen, they start behaving like a female.
[01:34:39.349 --> 01:34:45.875]  And when I talk about this, they have mainstream media come out and say, Alex is bashing gays, saying juice boxes make little boys gay.
[01:34:46.576 --> 01:34:48.858]  And it also, you know, gives them prostate cancer earlier.
[01:34:49.158 --> 01:34:51.560]  It also makes little girls go into puberty when they're five years old.
[01:34:53.362 --> 01:34:54.923]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[01:34:55.704 --> 01:34:57.305]  For the average age of puberty used to be, what, 14?
[01:34:57.786 --> 01:34:59.087]  Now it's like 10 or 9.
[01:35:00.048 --> 01:35:01.789]  Children as young as 3 are going into puberty.
[01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:04.552]  Breast cancer skyrocketing.
[01:35:06.966 --> 01:35:11.588]  And so yeah, a lot of folks want to say it is a choice completely so they can judge somebody and hate them.
[01:35:12.048 --> 01:35:12.728]  I'm not about that.
[01:35:13.489 --> 01:35:22.092]  But I am about exposing the Brave New World aspect that Aldous Huxley wrote about in 1932 with Brave New World.
[01:35:22.552 --> 01:35:31.736]  And he gave a speech in 1962 at Berkeley saying this was a real plan to end the sexes and make us drones.
[01:35:33.357 --> 01:35:36.318]  Now, whether they're going to get away with it or not remains to be seen, but
[01:35:37.401 --> 01:35:43.424]  We're all in a giant globalist experiment, and I am an expert on that, and I made the film Endgame exposing it.
[01:35:43.484 --> 01:35:58.511]  So, break down the science of this and what you think's happening with folks like Caitlyn Jenner and that whole cocktail, what you think the prime driver of this agenda is.
[01:36:00.412 --> 01:36:01.513]  I think that the prime
[01:36:02.998 --> 01:36:03.499]  I'm good.
[01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:23.203]  Our endocrine system, which is our hormonal system.
[01:36:23.223 --> 01:36:24.744]  And it's not just BPA.
[01:36:24.784 --> 01:36:30.789]  Like I was saying earlier, there's so much glyphosate and so much atrazine in the water supply.
[01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:32.971]  It's hard to avoid this stuff.
[01:36:33.011 --> 01:36:39.437]  I mean, a matter of fact, you can take people that have been juicing and raw vegans and do blood work on them.
[01:36:39.697 --> 01:36:46.282]  Over 90% of the population has detectable levels of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in their blood.
[01:36:47.083 --> 01:36:53.630]  All these things do is disrupt your hormones, so the end game is population control, sterility.
[01:36:55.231 --> 01:37:08.904]  When you feel like a woman, or if you're a woman that feels like a man, you're creating depression, you're creating anxiety, you're creating more money to diagnose you with mental illness.
[01:37:09.827 --> 01:37:10.788]  You're exposed.
[01:37:11.228 --> 01:37:20.794]  These endocrine-disrupting chemicals can have such a damaging effect at parts per billion, which means you only need tiny, tiny, tiny amounts of them.
[01:37:21.414 --> 01:37:26.877]  And it is causing sterility, low sperm count in men, infertility.
[01:37:27.017 --> 01:37:30.660]  It's causing breast cancer in women, prostate cancer.
[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:35.645]  So there's a lot of different things I think that we're getting into.
[01:37:36.026 --> 01:37:41.152]  We are like, these chemicals are creating almost like a transgender society.
[01:37:41.893 --> 01:37:50.523]  The boys that are being born, there's like seven girls being born in some countries to every one boy, because like you said earlier,
[01:37:51.204 --> 01:38:02.355]  If you have a lot of these chemicals, it doesn't allow you to change into a boy, because we're really all made as female, and then we eventually become a boy in the womb.
[01:38:03.176 --> 01:38:13.045]  But the restriction of this, in some countries that have high levels of endocrine disrupting chemicals, you're seeing seven women being born to every one boy.
[01:38:13.866 --> 01:38:34.740]  Not only that, you have the accumulation of all these chemicals and toxins that are coming in to the body that are mixing with these endocrine-disrupting chemicals, like the GMO foods, the gluten, which now has a chemical structure of opiates inside of it, which is addictive.
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:41.785]  And that's why if you look at pictures of people, black, white, I don't care, from 100 years ago, 50 years ago, they looked like people.
[01:38:41.845 --> 01:38:42.606]  They looked good.
[01:38:43.306 --> 01:38:46.869]  Everybody kind of looks like mutants now, some more than others.
[01:38:47.049 --> 01:38:48.991]  Women don't look like women at the beach.
[01:38:49.551 --> 01:38:54.676]  And when you see a classical-looking woman, it's like, wow, she looks like a woman.
[01:38:55.716 --> 01:38:59.720]  And then, so no one notices, they roll out and go, men want to be girls now!
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:04.384]  And add the social structure to make it acceptable to mainline it.
[01:39:05.715 --> 01:39:09.537]  Moving us towards a completely asexual system where we're all sterile.
[01:39:09.998 --> 01:39:13.500]  Now, 90 plus percent sperm drop across the Western world.
[01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:18.163]  Brazil and others, just decades after adopting our lifestyle, they're now seeing it.
[01:39:18.763 --> 01:39:19.964]  It is a plan.
[01:39:20.124 --> 01:39:22.846]  It is a globalist plan stated by them.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:24.900]  Absolutely.
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:31.243]  I mean, the FDA, first of all, in 2008 said that BPA was fine and nothing's wrong with it.
[01:39:31.283 --> 01:39:39.346]  And then when Canada yanked BPA, the baby bottles off, and then Walmart decided to yank all the baby bottles in the U.S.
[01:39:39.406 --> 01:39:50.571]  In 2010, the FDA then finally admitted that the National Toxology Program studies were correct and that BPA was damaging to the brain, behavior, prostate, gland, fetuses, children.
[01:39:51.371 --> 01:39:53.252]  But they didn't do anything about it.
[01:39:53.292 --> 01:40:04.959]  It's just all these government organizations that are designed to do something and protect us, like the EPA, the Atomic Energy Commission, the USDA, the TSA.
[01:40:04.999 --> 01:40:14.084]  I mean, all these generic organizations that are out there are not doing anything to protect us, but they're just attacking the natural people and the people that are trying to
[01:40:15.589 --> 01:40:22.193]  Rally and through activism shut these companies down that are damaging not only the people but also damaging the planet.
[01:40:22.213 --> 01:40:24.954]  Like you said, we're not the only ones affected by this.
[01:40:25.034 --> 01:40:27.435]  All the animals are starting to become affected.
[01:40:27.475 --> 01:40:28.096]  The bees.
[01:40:29.096 --> 01:40:31.417]  That's the whole ecosystem that we live in.
[01:40:31.497 --> 01:40:41.423]  You can search that in the Mississippi River and out in the Gulf upwards of half the fish in some of the trawls they do have both sexual organs or are sterile.
[01:40:42.623 --> 01:40:45.144]  Or have sexual organs growing on the sides of their bodies.
[01:40:45.844 --> 01:40:56.388]  I mean, they are so mutated because when they're embryos, we know fish and amphibian embryos are even more easily affected because they're in the water itself, not inside their mother.
[01:40:56.688 --> 01:41:04.651]  The mother acts as some form of a filter that with the fish and embryos, they're getting a full dose and it is just devastating them.
[01:41:04.991 --> 01:41:09.793]  But see, we're now being tranny fish-a-phobic.
[01:41:10.513 --> 01:41:13.620]  Because we're trying to be mean to the sexual preference of the fish.
[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:13.940]  No.
[01:41:14.401 --> 01:41:15.483]  The fish is mutated.
[01:41:15.523 --> 01:41:16.485]  The fish is dying.
[01:41:17.836 --> 01:41:27.560]  But now that people have been changed, they want to hold on to this chemical identity, and they want to go all the way with more chemicals to become the woman, to become the man.
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:36.183]  And it's just a really sick scientific program that Huxley wrote a fiction book about, but later admitted.
[01:41:36.403 --> 01:41:43.326]  How crazy is it that his brother ran the UN UNESCO program, was the top eugenicist in the world, and the founder of transhumanism,
[01:41:43.906 --> 01:41:44.987]  Set our current course.
[01:41:45.247 --> 01:41:51.930]  His brother wrote a book about it and then admitted in his other book Brave New World Revisited that it was an actual plan.
[01:41:52.570 --> 01:42:00.274]  So we have this mountain of a literary famous person telling us this isn't fiction.
[01:42:01.474 --> 01:42:20.547]  And we're here living now, deeply into this, as our whole world is being hijacked by these mad scientists, and the average trendy doesn't care, and wants to eat chemicals that won't just change their sexuality, and, you know, bare minimum make them metrosexual, but they want the cancer, I guess.
[01:42:20.607 --> 01:42:22.148]  They want to be sterile.
[01:42:22.308 --> 01:42:27.732]  Because I hear them, I see their comments, they go, good, I don't want to have kids, I'm glad they're sterilizing me, humanity sucks anyways.
[01:42:28.032 --> 01:42:31.234]  I mean, it's this give up attitude that is just insane.
[01:42:32.874 --> 01:42:51.239]  Well, even in 2011, Harvard School of Health published a study in the Journal of Pediatrics and found that pregnant mothers' exposure to BPA and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals correlated with hyperactivity, anxiety, aggression, depression, ADD, and ADHD for the child.
[01:42:51.259 --> 01:43:01.101]  So, again, you know, you have to look at all these conditions as being caused by some form of chemical coming into the body that's disrupting your normal brain activity.
[01:43:01.261 --> 01:43:15.812]  Sure, well I used to be against folks here and people that did testosterone replacement, but the more I research it and everything, and doctors are in the news admitting that men's testosterone, by the time they're 40, is half on average what it used to be.
[01:43:16.032 --> 01:43:19.535]  There is a war on the literal male chemical.
[01:43:21.462 --> 01:43:30.670]  You know, the scary part about it is, I mean, there's a good news to it because there's a lot of things we can do to avoid these things and clean our body to prevent this thing from happening.
[01:43:30.710 --> 01:43:38.256]  But the scary thing is, done by design, this really will affect you for four generations.
[01:43:38.337 --> 01:43:40.198]  This changes your genetic code.
[01:43:40.418 --> 01:43:44.302]  It literally changes the way your DNA is and can affect you.
[01:43:44.402 --> 01:43:48.565]  And the studies have been done on mice at University of Virginia School of Medicine, actually.
[01:43:49.466 --> 01:43:53.710]  That showed that four generations later these mice were still affected.
[01:43:53.790 --> 01:44:01.876]  So we're starting to get into these generational cycles and it's sad to think that, you know, the next four generations can be affected by all these chemicals.
[01:44:01.936 --> 01:44:04.759]  And it's not like we're slowing down and eliminating the chemicals.
[01:44:05.903 --> 01:44:14.405]  It's getting worse and there's more glyphosate and more of these chemicals being sprayed and put in all of our food supply, the water, and everything else.
[01:44:15.105 --> 01:44:17.706]  I want to go to phone calls and keep you a little bit in the next hour.
[01:44:17.746 --> 01:44:28.468]  Then we've got a major media owner coming on to talk about the war on free speech and the war globally on internet freedom that we find in the TPP.
[01:44:29.108 --> 01:44:31.689]  But before we do that, I didn't plug anything last hour.
[01:44:32.969 --> 01:44:34.430]  I'm skipping a ton of network breaks.
[01:44:34.650 --> 01:44:35.570]  I'm so obnoxious.
[01:44:37.210 --> 01:44:48.853]  We fund ourselves with high-quality water filtration systems that cut out the fluoride and the garbage, the glyphosates, with the ProPure G2 systems that blow away the competition at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:44:49.634 --> 01:44:57.756]  We have gotten in the t-shirts that we have had made that say, Save America, with an upside-down flag.
[01:44:59.397 --> 01:45:00.198]  And it has the U.S.
[01:45:00.238 --> 01:45:03.941]  code that when the country is in dire straits, you are to fly the flag upside down.
[01:45:03.961 --> 01:45:05.623]  It's a great conversation starter.
[01:45:05.823 --> 01:45:07.765]  On the back it says, our Republic is in distress.
[01:45:08.165 --> 01:45:10.867]  Ask me why infowars.com.
[01:45:13.209 --> 01:45:16.032]  Purchasing the Patriot apparel helps fund the operation.
[01:45:17.113 --> 01:45:20.376]  We are running out of the current stock of Survival Shield X2.
[01:45:20.936 --> 01:45:23.459]  Hopefully we'll just be out a month or so.
[01:45:25.305 --> 01:45:29.788]  Dr. Group has a small amount left in his major factory laboratory that's been produced.
[01:45:30.308 --> 01:45:36.832]  He does have more of the crystals that are mined from between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[01:45:38.823 --> 01:45:40.844]  That supply is running low.
[01:45:41.184 --> 01:45:42.224]  You'll have to procure more.
[01:45:42.684 --> 01:45:44.985]  We ended up finding this source two years ago.
[01:45:45.025 --> 01:45:48.706]  The cleanest ever, ever sold, ever used that we've been able to find.
[01:45:48.726 --> 01:45:49.646]  I mean, it's a game changer.
[01:45:49.886 --> 01:45:53.808]  The other stuff comes from kelp sources, which just isn't as strong or pure.
[01:45:53.828 --> 01:45:55.168]  I mean, it's a lot better than not having iodine.
[01:45:55.188 --> 01:45:55.888]  You'll die without it.
[01:45:56.689 --> 01:45:58.329]  But that's why this is so much more palatable.
[01:45:58.669 --> 01:46:00.210]  It's why the effect is so much stronger.
[01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:03.991]  There was a guy playing the accordion at an Italian food restaurant I was at last night.
[01:46:04.966 --> 01:46:06.148]  And he ran over and was a listener.
[01:46:06.668 --> 01:46:10.433]  And he said, listen, I took that stuff and I had to cut my dose in half.
[01:46:10.614 --> 01:46:15.120]  I totally detoxed, lost a bunch of weight, got healthier, broke out everywhere.
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:16.421]  All these toxins came out.
[01:46:16.942 --> 01:46:20.487]  I've had so much more energy, but boy, it's good you tell people, look out.
[01:46:21.068 --> 01:46:22.249]  Yeah, consult a physician.
[01:46:22.930 --> 01:46:24.612]  Okay, or consult a nutritionist or whatever.
[01:46:25.592 --> 01:46:27.834]  This is the most powerful iodine out there.
[01:46:28.235 --> 01:46:30.557]  Other stuff they sell at the store will eat holes in your guts.
[01:46:30.577 --> 01:46:32.098]  You know, stuff you put on topically.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.241]  So again, consult your physician.
[01:46:35.701 --> 01:46:37.263]  But this is a major game changer.
[01:46:37.563 --> 01:46:38.784]  That's why I've stockpiled it.
[01:46:39.244 --> 01:46:44.329]  And I realize as we're running out of it, we were having trouble getting another super clean source.
[01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:47.592]  And that's how we ended up finding this two years ago.
[01:46:49.358 --> 01:46:51.979]  And so, Dr. Group, I know you want to get into Fukushima separately.
[01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:58.602]  In the news article right here, leaked Fukushima containers could lead to hydrogen explosions, RT.
[01:46:58.623 --> 01:47:00.063]  There's 333 of the containers.
[01:47:00.463 --> 01:47:03.005]  Each one could be as big as one of the other meltdowns.
[01:47:04.085 --> 01:47:08.187]  But I don't really take this just because of background radiation increasing or isotopes or whatever.
[01:47:08.627 --> 01:47:15.711]  I take it because I understand my glands will get filled with bad halogens, become toxic and fail, like the thyroid, and they don't fill it with good
[01:47:16.991 --> 01:47:17.451]  Halogen.
[01:47:17.551 --> 01:47:22.995]  And when I forget, and that's iodine, to take my iodine every day, I feel it.
[01:47:23.915 --> 01:47:26.056]  I mean, it gives me a bigger boost than a cup of coffee.
[01:47:26.577 --> 01:47:28.178]  And I always remember hearing this from the hippies.
[01:47:29.378 --> 01:47:34.321]  Like I said, 20-something years ago, I'd go to Barton Springs and see hippies and I'd say, what's that in that jug or that bottle?
[01:47:35.782 --> 01:47:37.103]  And they'd say, it's iodine.
[01:47:38.834 --> 01:47:40.634]  They'd be just, you know, in super good shape.
[01:47:40.654 --> 01:47:42.995]  Some, like, 70-year-old guy looking like he was 40.
[01:47:44.055 --> 01:47:46.216]  And then they'd go, yeah, hippie, whatever.
[01:47:46.956 --> 01:47:48.957]  But remember, this is something the hippies have always known.
[01:47:49.297 --> 01:47:50.437]  What is it about iodine?
[01:47:50.517 --> 01:47:51.297]  What does it do?
[01:47:51.997 --> 01:47:56.919]  And I sure hope we can continue to get these deep-earth crystal sources.
[01:47:57.679 --> 01:47:58.159]  Dr. Groot.
[01:47:59.349 --> 01:48:09.297]  Well, yeah, I mean, you know, anytime you drill from deep down in the earth, you know, you might have a time where, just like oil drilling, where it might dry up a little bit and you need to find some more.
[01:48:09.337 --> 01:48:25.911]  But another thing that I think is going on, and this is proven by what just happened a few days ago in Fukushima, when they're saying that Fukushima is leaking again now and it's the worst ever, the readings in the port in Fukushima.
[01:48:27.459 --> 01:48:32.320]  I think that countries are now secretly trying to stock up on a lot of iodine.
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:35.401]  It's, you know, iodine contamination.
[01:48:35.701 --> 01:48:40.902]  Iodine-131 is being found now in the rain, in milk supplies, in the food supplies.
[01:48:41.482 --> 01:48:45.503]  But like you said, it's not only the radioactive iodine.
[01:48:45.643 --> 01:48:52.304]  And another thing, actually, that happens is, as that iodine is leaking into the Atlantic Ocean, it also mixes with salt water.
[01:48:52.324 --> 01:48:55.625]  And when you mix iodine with salt, it creates iodides.
[01:48:56.605 --> 01:49:05.271]  It can even produce nanoparticles of weird substances that can even be gassed off and go up into the atmosphere for a while.
[01:49:05.331 --> 01:49:09.814]  But my research with iodine is that everybody pretty much needs it.
[01:49:09.994 --> 01:49:14.537]  We're all deficient in iodine because there's really not any sources of iodine left.
[01:49:15.178 --> 01:49:15.858]  And guess what?
[01:49:15.898 --> 01:49:21.682]  We've been talking about estrogen dominance and endocrine disrupting chemicals.
[01:49:23.263 --> 01:49:27.687]  Estrogen actually inhibits the absorption of iodine.
[01:49:27.808 --> 01:49:43.022]  So you might actually link that and say, is there a conspiracy behind the endocrine-disrupting chemicals knowing that you're not going to be able to get iodine, the absorption of iodine, if you have those chemicals in, which would mean soy or anything else.
[01:49:43.803 --> 01:49:52.387]  Now, the government sets an RDA of 150 micrograms a day, but they set that because that was the amount that would prevent a goiter.
[01:49:52.947 --> 01:50:02.951]  But they know that everybody needs much more iodine in their system, even up to, you know, what I take, sometimes even up to 20 milligrams a day, which is 20,000 micrograms.
[01:50:04.833 --> 01:50:05.493]  I agree with you.
[01:50:05.534 --> 01:50:07.935]  Everybody needs to consult with their healthcare practitioner.
[01:50:08.355 --> 01:50:15.860]  But if you look around, we're seeing a massive increase in breast cancer, fibrocystic breast disease.
[01:50:16.221 --> 01:50:20.283]  We're talking about any type of glandular, prostate gland.
[01:50:20.684 --> 01:50:25.807]  All these things are affected by iodine, being iodine deficient.
[01:50:26.287 --> 01:50:32.552]  The thyroid needs about 6,000 micrograms, 3,000 to 6,000 micrograms every single day just for normal functioning.
[01:50:33.484 --> 01:50:37.626]  So, if you're not sweating, you might be deficient in iodine.
[01:50:37.646 --> 01:50:51.991]  If you have cold hands and feet, if your skin is dry, you have insomnia, hair loss, mental illness, again linked to iodine deficiency, depression, anxiety, low immune system, weight gain.
[01:50:52.011 --> 01:50:57.073]  You know, pregnancy and miscarriages are being linked to iodine deficiency.
[01:50:57.154 --> 01:50:59.655]  Fibromyalgia is a deficiency.
[01:50:59.675 --> 01:51:02.656]  Iodine is a powerful antimicrobial.
[01:51:03.709 --> 01:51:13.594]  It was... studies have been done on iodine which was suspended in a solution and it inactivated viruses at dilutions of like one in one million.
[01:51:14.494 --> 01:51:15.835]  So iodine is just...
[01:51:17.057 --> 01:51:23.179]  Something that I feel every person, they've done studies on pregnant mothers and found out that they're deficient in iodine.
[01:51:23.719 --> 01:51:33.383]  Something that I use, my kids take, and something that I feel is necessary because it's not just us saying that everybody's iodine deficient.
[01:51:33.403 --> 01:51:41.746]  The World Health Organization's Department of Nutrition and Health and Development came out and said that iodine deficiency is a public health problem in 54 countries.
[01:51:45.572 --> 01:51:51.938]  Elemental iodine is what the iodine is in its natural state, and that's what it is deep in the earth.
[01:51:51.978 --> 01:52:05.231]  And that consists of two iodine atoms that are bonded together, and that is a highly corrosive and toxic compound because it's part of the halogens, which is fluoride and bromine and chlorine and iodine.
[01:52:05.251 --> 01:52:06.492]  And I don't want to confuse people.
[01:52:07.694 --> 01:52:14.579]  Explain to them, we're saying iodine's a good halogen, the problem is when it binds with radiation, then it's a bad one.
[01:52:14.619 --> 01:52:18.363]  That's why you need the good one, so that there's no room for the bad one to come in.
[01:52:19.502 --> 01:52:30.270]  Well, the iodine in its raw state can be very corrosive, and that's, even though we're taking the best raw state, it still has to go through a seven-step process to be detoxified.
[01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:39.396]  Explain that to people, because I was listening to the hippies finally, before I even knew you, and I started taking iodine here and there, but it would give me a stomachache, you name it.
[01:52:40.577 --> 01:52:42.959]  The stuff they sell at the store will basically kill you, they admit that.
[01:52:43.379 --> 01:52:46.502]  So how is this so different, and how is it palatable?
[01:52:47.282 --> 01:52:53.444]  Okay, so when iodine comes out of the ground, it's iodine, there's two iodine molecules in its natural state.
[01:52:53.504 --> 01:52:56.205]  So it's just two iodine atoms bonded together.
[01:52:56.805 --> 01:53:09.729]  So what they did a long time ago was create, they found that they could stabilize it, and you show the pictures of when it's smoking because iodine will evaporate or it'll outgas into the air when it comes in contact with oxygen.
[01:53:10.689 --> 01:53:21.339]  What they figured a way to do was to make an iodide, and that's what you see all the military and the country stocking up on is potassium iodide, and what that is is the ion state of iodine.
[01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:25.523]  And that's produced by bonding the iodine to another element.
[01:53:26.004 --> 01:53:27.565]  In this case, it would be potassium.
[01:53:28.328 --> 01:53:34.552]  This form of iodine, it can be ingested and it can be applied to the skin, but it's hard to break down in the body.
[01:53:35.173 --> 01:53:46.441]  So what we did is developed a proprietary technology to where we take the iodine crystals out of the ground and those have to go through a process to become 99.99% pure.
[01:53:46.481 --> 01:53:48.002]  Once we get the 99.99% pure iodine crystals,
[01:53:54.517 --> 01:54:00.302]  We create a nascent or an atomic-based iodine that contains a single iodine atom.
[01:54:00.702 --> 01:54:12.912]  So instead of something being bonded and there's two and that has to be broken in the body, the nascent, the survival shield X2, has a iodine atom which is an active atom and it's easy for your body to absorb.
[01:54:12.952 --> 01:54:20.458]  And that's why the stuff that you developed using the Russian technology in your own research turns electric blue, the true color of real iodine,
[01:54:21.138 --> 01:54:24.201]  Not red like all the others is because I guess they're bound.
[01:54:24.542 --> 01:54:26.264]  Yours is in the single form.
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:27.300]  Right.
[01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:29.161]  Ours is reactive right away.
[01:54:29.361 --> 01:54:30.541]  It's an atomic form.
[01:54:30.641 --> 01:54:32.462]  It's a single-bonded iodine.
[01:54:32.942 --> 01:54:35.663]  It's exactly what the body needs to utilize.
[01:54:35.703 --> 01:54:37.164]  So we shouldn't call this nascent iodine.
[01:54:37.184 --> 01:54:38.464]  We should call it atomic iodine.
[01:54:38.864 --> 01:54:40.445]  Well, it's pretty much the same thing.
[01:54:41.345 --> 01:54:42.486]  Some people say nascent.
[01:54:42.506 --> 01:54:43.566]  Some people say atomic.
[01:54:43.606 --> 01:54:47.068]  It just means as an active electron on its outer shell.
[01:54:47.188 --> 01:54:50.649]  Why, when I first started taking iodine, did it make all this stuff come out of my pores?
[01:54:52.694 --> 01:55:01.898]  Well, iodine will fight for the receptor sites in the thyroid gland and everywhere else in the body, in the fat cells, especially where toxins are kept.
[01:55:02.178 --> 01:55:12.243]  And iodine's been proven to immobilize chemicals and toxins and heavy metals from the tissues, and then they go back into your system so you can eliminate them properly.
[01:55:12.363 --> 01:55:18.946]  So that's why, on average, two to three weeks after taking it, you'll feel like crap, and then troubles start coming out of you, you're detoxing.
[01:55:20.003 --> 01:55:32.074]  It just depends on each individual, but it depends on how much, you know, fluoride they have in their body, the chlorine, bromine, other chemicals, heavy metals, lead actually, mercury.
[01:55:32.614 --> 01:55:38.079]  It'll just, it'll start pushing that stuff out and then getting into the tissue where you need it the most.
[01:55:38.319 --> 01:55:41.241]  Because I mean, I got energy right away, and I had energy while I felt bad.
[01:55:41.261 --> 01:55:42.903]  It just kind of felt like a hangover for a week.
[01:55:43.223 --> 01:55:51.070]  And then after that, it was like when you've been carrying, say, your seven-year-old on your shoulders up a hill, and you take them off, and it feels like you're flying, you know?
[01:55:51.410 --> 01:55:52.491]  Walking feels so easy.
[01:55:52.951 --> 01:55:57.635]  That's what... It felt like I was 18 again after I went through that detox.
[01:55:57.755 --> 01:55:58.476]  It was just amazing.
[01:55:59.363 --> 01:56:04.684]  Well, because it's balancing your hormones out, too, because it displaces some of those endocrine-disrupting chemicals.
[01:56:05.424 --> 01:56:08.405]  And iodine is just an amazing substance.
[01:56:08.525 --> 01:56:22.367]  Once your thyroid gland starts to reactivate again, and your pineal gland starts to decalcify, and your hormones start functioning, usually when you have hormone disruption, that's when all your symptoms start to happen.
[01:56:22.387 --> 01:56:27.068]  Your low energy, your fatigue, your mental conditions, your weight gain around your
[01:56:27.989 --> 01:56:35.298]  Around your stomach and your buttocks area, your insomnia, your skin issues, you know, if you have any dry skin, psoriasis, eczema.
[01:56:36.602 --> 01:56:48.534]  Cysts in your body, depression, anxiety, miscarriages in women, I mean all those things are going to be, there's a whole slew of symptoms that we can link to iodine.
[01:56:48.554 --> 01:56:58.244]  And if folks don't want to get Survival Shield X2, original Survival Shield, they can go do research and find good salts that do have good iodine in them, correct?
[01:56:59.943 --> 01:57:07.750]  Well, you can get a Himalayan crystal salt, and that's going to have some good iodine in it, but again, it's probably going to be bonded to a sodium or potassium.
[01:57:08.831 --> 01:57:14.136]  There's no form of iodine like the X2 out there, and it's easy to take.
[01:57:14.577 --> 01:57:17.740]  You're probably, even in the salts, not going to get enough.
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:19.521]  But still, it's better than nothing.
[01:57:19.722 --> 01:57:20.282]  It's better than nothing.
[01:57:20.302 --> 01:57:21.083]  It's better than nothing.
[01:57:21.163 --> 01:57:22.024]  It's better than nothing.
[01:57:22.104 --> 01:57:25.368]  But you've got to remember, think of all the chemicals that you're bringing into your body.
[01:57:25.408 --> 01:57:27.470]  How many people out there have mercury amalgam fillings?
[01:57:27.790 --> 01:57:32.195]  They're constantly getting mercury gas leaking into their brain and their bloodstream.
[01:57:32.596 --> 01:57:33.937]  All the chemicals... Sure, let me ask you this.
[01:57:33.957 --> 01:57:35.499]  We've got a break and then come back and take calls.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.061]  Here we got Dave, who's a vet, has a question about his meds.
[01:57:40.502 --> 01:57:42.502]  Robert wants to talk about mercury and dental fillings you just mentioned.
[01:57:42.862 --> 01:57:44.483]  I'm going to push our next guest back.
[01:57:44.523 --> 01:57:49.545]  I want to interview him, but until about 15 after, I'll do the whole rest of the hour with our next guest on media.
[01:57:49.865 --> 01:57:51.066]  Very important interview coming up.
[01:57:51.966 --> 01:57:54.187]  But we're one minute from break here.
[01:57:54.948 --> 01:58:04.952]  I just wanted to get into the fact that you don't want to openly say this on air, but you were talking to some researchers and folks who were trying to test this, but the way you use organic palm glycerin
[01:58:06.282 --> 01:58:11.611]  Just as a different medium than alcohol, what's happening with the iodine going into that?
[01:58:11.691 --> 01:58:16.100]  You think that might be making it even more bioavailable, or what's happening?
[01:58:17.205 --> 01:58:27.867]  Well, with our research, we're looking for a natural, non-toxic source to be able to stabilize the iodine in that state.
[01:58:28.667 --> 01:58:34.628]  All the research before has been done with alcohol, but we now know that alcohol in itself is an endocrine-disrupting chemical.
[01:58:34.668 --> 01:58:44.870]  So if alcohol is an endocrine-disrupting chemical, and iodine is supposed to take the endocrine-disrupting chemicals out of the body, then it's kind of, you know, it's kind of one of those
[01:58:46.141 --> 01:58:47.844]  You know, buffering situations.
[01:58:47.864 --> 01:58:48.686]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:58:48.706 --> 01:58:49.768]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:49.828 --> 01:58:50.329]  It's important.
[01:58:50.349 --> 01:58:51.150]  Third Hour, folks.
[01:58:51.170 --> 01:58:52.072]  Ton of news as well.

[01:59:17.211 --> 01:59:20.713]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then

[02:00:49.372 --> 02:00:53.075]  Talking about the attack on free speech, the TPP, you name it.
[02:00:53.356 --> 02:00:55.898]  We're going to go to 15 after with Dr. Grip to take your calls.
[02:00:55.938 --> 02:00:56.859]  I appreciate you holding.
[02:00:57.399 --> 02:00:59.101]  Dave in Missouri, you have a question.
[02:00:59.141 --> 02:00:59.541]  Go ahead.
[02:01:02.964 --> 02:01:05.166]  Welcome Dave from Missouri.
[02:01:05.206 --> 02:01:05.566]  Go ahead.
[02:01:05.606 --> 02:01:06.127]  You're on the air.
[02:01:08.206 --> 02:01:09.187]  Hey, that caller's gone.
[02:01:09.207 --> 02:01:10.909]  Let's talk to Robert in Nevada.
[02:01:10.949 --> 02:01:11.589]  You're on the air.
[02:01:11.609 --> 02:01:12.430]  Go ahead, Robert.
[02:01:13.692 --> 02:01:14.272]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:14.412 --> 02:01:15.393]  I'm 14 years old.
[02:01:15.413 --> 02:01:16.594]  I've been watching for a while.
[02:01:16.955 --> 02:01:28.226]  When I was 7 years old, I got fillings with mercury, and after that I was diagnosed with OCD, so I was just curious as to if that linked to any kind of mental disorders.
[02:01:28.526 --> 02:01:30.689]  Well, I know dentists have a record of, you know,
[02:01:32.071 --> 02:01:33.092]  Thank you very much.
[02:01:48.746 --> 02:01:58.472]  No, you're absolutely right, like what you were talking about with the Mad Hatter, and mercury has, especially when it combines with aluminum in the brain, it can create violent reactions.
[02:01:58.552 --> 02:02:16.923]  So, I would definitely say that that would be something I would look at, and mercury is extremely damaging, so my recommendation would be to find a biological dentist somewhere in your area that can safely remove the mercury amalgam fillings and replace them with maybe a non-toxic porcelain or something like that.
[02:02:17.583 --> 02:02:24.546]  Just make sure that he uses the proper dental dams and some of them use ozone.
[02:02:24.586 --> 02:02:32.470]  You might want to look for one that does that to neutralize any of the gases the mercury releases as they remove them.
[02:02:32.770 --> 02:02:39.754]  Some people have gone down to Mexico that we've talked to to get their mercury amalgams removed and ended up paralyzed from the waist down because
[02:02:40.234 --> 02:02:49.856]  When they're removing the mercury amalgams, if you swallow a big chunk or too much of the gas is released, it can cause such damaging neurological damage that could even paralyze you.
[02:02:50.996 --> 02:02:51.816]  Unbelievable.
[02:02:52.817 --> 02:02:55.037]  Reality is just so much stranger than fiction.
[02:02:55.457 --> 02:02:56.517]  Mercury and fillings?
[02:02:56.637 --> 02:02:58.318]  I mean, it's like mercury in the vaccines.
[02:02:58.838 --> 02:02:59.578]  It's insanity.
[02:03:00.058 --> 02:03:00.858]  Anything else, Robert?
[02:03:02.119 --> 02:03:04.019]  That's all, but thank you very much for taking my call.
[02:03:04.259 --> 02:03:05.319]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[02:03:06.439 --> 02:03:08.540]  Christina in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:08.940]  Go ahead.
[02:03:10.385 --> 02:03:12.668]  A question, I'm sorry, I'm going to... Sure, go ahead.
[02:03:12.968 --> 02:03:15.871]  Oh, no, it's alright, no problem.
[02:03:15.911 --> 02:03:16.552]  Two questions.
[02:03:16.572 --> 02:03:18.314]  You mentioned mercury in vaccines.
[02:03:18.354 --> 02:03:26.322]  That's not exactly what I called about, but I found myself yesterday having a more intense discussion with a good friend of mine than I expected to have.
[02:03:26.362 --> 02:03:31.808]  He came over about something else, and kind of out of the blue, he asked me about the whooping cough vaccine.
[02:03:32.869 --> 02:03:37.052]  Uh, you know, my wife actually had a miscarriage recently, and it reminded me of the iodine.
[02:03:37.092 --> 02:03:38.292]  She didn't like the taste of the X2.
[02:03:38.452 --> 02:03:40.474]  I'm going to try the original survivalist.
[02:03:40.494 --> 02:03:41.754]  She preferred the taste of that.
[02:03:42.635 --> 02:03:44.376]  That's a completely separate issue.
[02:03:44.916 --> 02:03:57.143]  But he mentioned the whooping cough, and I can tell, and this is the whole thing, where his concern for me and his concern for my well-being, ultimately for our future child's well-being, that comes off as
[02:03:57.921 --> 02:04:03.062]  You know, somehow if I'm against the vaccine, you know, well then how about my wife?
[02:04:03.102 --> 02:04:04.303]  You know, she's the better half.
[02:04:04.363 --> 02:04:05.443]  What does she say about it?
[02:04:05.503 --> 02:04:12.145]  So, you can't just say, well, you're, you know, I'm against vaccines or even I'm against mercury in vaccines.
[02:04:12.645 --> 02:04:20.847]  You almost have to go step by step through some phenomenological explanation of what the child goes through because I've had eyewitness
[02:04:21.622 --> 02:04:27.406]  I've spoken to a father who told me, point blank, he watched the light go out in his child's eyes.
[02:04:27.806 --> 02:04:29.567]  And I said, well, it can be reversed.
[02:04:29.627 --> 02:04:30.928]  They're trying to be optimistic.
[02:04:30.988 --> 02:04:36.572]  And he says, well, yeah, but my wife, she doesn't think we should do that, or she thinks it was God's will.
[02:04:36.612 --> 02:04:38.433]  He didn't really say that.
[02:04:38.493 --> 02:04:40.235]  No, it's modern human sacrifice.
[02:04:40.275 --> 02:04:43.457]  Look, there's no reason to take a hepatitis shot for a child.
[02:04:43.817 --> 02:04:44.878]  They're extremely dangerous.
[02:04:45.738 --> 02:04:48.760]  The government quietly pays off vaccine-damaged kids.
[02:04:49.541 --> 02:04:50.662]  It's a huge cover-up.
[02:04:52.123 --> 02:04:58.107]  So we're going to come back and get Dr. Grip's breakdown on that and take a few final calls straight ahead.
[02:04:58.188 --> 02:05:02.551]  But yes, they are pushing vaccines now on pregnant women.
[02:05:03.912 --> 02:05:06.594]  They know what they're doing, but they can't admit they're wrong.
[02:05:10.649 --> 02:05:11.190]  The U.S.
[02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:14.413]  now claims the Syrian government is working with ISIS.
[02:05:14.654 --> 02:05:15.815]  Officials at the U.S.
[02:05:15.935 --> 02:05:30.192]  Embassy Syria Twitter account accused the regime of aiding ISIS in the takeover of Aleppo this week, alleging President Assad has not only avoided engaging ISIS targets, but has actively attempted to bolster their position with airstrikes.
[02:05:30.492 --> 02:05:32.633]  Talk about a major shift in narrative.
[02:05:32.753 --> 02:05:41.896]  Since the beginning of Syria's so-called civil war, the Obama administration has funded and armed radical Islamists under the guise of supporting moderate rebels.
[02:05:42.116 --> 02:05:46.858]  Last February, the president even handed the Free Syrian Army the ability to order U.S.
[02:05:47.078 --> 02:05:47.718]  airstrikes.
[02:05:48.018 --> 02:05:57.406]  And one jihadist told Al Jazeera in 2013, FSA fighters regularly sell their weapons to ISIS once receiving shipments from the U.S.
[02:05:57.586 --> 02:05:58.747]  Well, that's when the U.S.
[02:05:58.807 --> 02:06:03.051]  isn't accidentally dropping weapons right in ISIS territory.
[02:06:03.211 --> 02:06:06.854]  So, who's really trying to bolster their position in Syria?
[02:06:07.034 --> 02:06:09.637]  Read the full story at InfoWars.com
[02:06:10.217 --> 02:06:29.791]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.

[02:08:28.337 --> 02:08:31.839]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:08:32.419 --> 02:08:34.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:36.861 --> 02:08:43.884]  Hayden Hewitt, the founder of LiveLeak.com that reaches billions of live streams a year, hundreds of millions of people.
[02:08:46.354 --> 02:08:55.017]  It has really helped us get the word out and opened up our streams to reach millions of people at Bilderberg coverage and other events.
[02:08:55.117 --> 02:08:58.679]  One time we had over 2 million people on the line at one time.
[02:08:58.699 --> 02:09:04.381]  We had 3 million people watch over the next two days.
[02:09:06.075 --> 02:09:08.055]  That's something that definitely scares the establishment.
[02:09:08.876 --> 02:09:20.678]  He's going to be joining us here in about 10 minutes talking about attacks on the First Amendment, not just here in the U.S., but free speech overseas, how the TPP attacks free speech according to WikiLeaks documents, and more.
[02:09:21.278 --> 02:09:29.700]  But I want to try to get to four or five of these calls, Felicia, Mike, Jim, Tim, and others, before Dr. Group has to leave.
[02:09:31.209 --> 02:09:40.060]  The last caller was just desperate talking about having a child and the doctor trying to bully him to give vaccines and then trying to go to his wife to get her to do it.
[02:09:41.121 --> 02:09:45.627]  It's just crazy how they're pushing the vaccine so aggressively right now.
[02:09:47.870 --> 02:09:49.510]  Yeah, and flu shots.
[02:09:49.570 --> 02:09:50.791]  Flu shots and vaccines.
[02:09:50.871 --> 02:09:55.492]  I mean, you can get them in a grocery store now and get 10% off your total bill.
[02:09:56.212 --> 02:10:00.293]  It's one of those controversial subjects where you just have to do your own research.
[02:10:00.333 --> 02:10:07.834]  I mean, I tell people, don't believe me, go type in vaccine dangers in Google and you'll find plenty of information.
[02:10:07.874 --> 02:10:10.775]  The MMR shot says it can give you type 1 diabetes.
[02:10:13.041 --> 02:10:15.743]  Well, they can give you a lot more than that.
[02:10:15.823 --> 02:10:29.275]  I mean, vaccines and flu shots, if you look at all the different ingredients inside of them, look, just go in and type in vaccine ingredients and take each one of them and you'll see that they change your DNA, RNA, they alter your
[02:10:29.875 --> 02:10:37.321]  Your mental ability, they can cause cancer, they can cause all different types of symptoms, mental retardation, and the list goes on and on.
[02:10:37.342 --> 02:10:42.766]  And they're being manufactured by these big, evil pharmaceutical companies that, I mean, Bayer makes vaccines.
[02:10:43.146 --> 02:10:51.353]  They got caught for over a decade sending out factor VIII for hemophiliacs that they knew had HIV and hepatitis and it was a death sentence.
[02:10:52.094 --> 02:10:55.119]  It's exactly opposite of your immune system.
[02:10:55.139 --> 02:11:06.836]  Your immune system, what you're designed with in your body, your self-healing mechanism, is designed to do the best work at fighting viruses, bacteria, keeping your body strong and healthy.
[02:11:07.884 --> 02:11:16.970]  What they do, a vaccine is nothing more than a shot to kill your own not natural system or to reduce your own immune system.
[02:11:17.850 --> 02:11:24.995]  And your immune system has to work extra hard because it has to fight all the chemicals and toxins that are in the vaccine or the flu shot to begin with.
[02:11:25.095 --> 02:11:31.039]  So, I mean, if you dig deep enough, you could even see that they list the dangers on the
[02:11:33.163 --> 02:11:39.785]  The CDC's website, the FDA, the pharmaceutical manufacturers of the vaccines, the inserts.
[02:11:40.326 --> 02:11:42.547]  They lie to the public and say safe and effective.
[02:11:43.027 --> 02:11:44.327]  Yeah, it's right there in plain sight.
[02:11:44.347 --> 02:11:56.672]  You just have to stop and say, wait a second, why am I going to, I mean, that's the main situation that we're dealing with now with food, beverages, water, exposure to any of these things is people don't just say,
[02:11:57.412 --> 02:12:00.953]  Wait, let me see what's in this beverage before I drink it.
[02:12:01.113 --> 02:12:03.534]  Let me see what's in this food before I eat it.
[02:12:03.754 --> 02:12:07.575]  Let me research what's in this vaccine or flu shot before I stick it in my body.
[02:12:09.316 --> 02:12:09.796]  That's right.
[02:12:10.056 --> 02:12:10.396]  All right.
[02:12:10.456 --> 02:12:11.617]  I want to go through these calls.
[02:12:11.717 --> 02:12:13.077]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:12:13.097 --> 02:12:13.517]  Go ahead.
[02:12:15.298 --> 02:12:15.798]  Hey, guys.
[02:12:16.898 --> 02:12:24.721]  I was thinking of an idea for a product that would help maybe come off Oxycontin or pain medicine.
[02:12:25.769 --> 02:12:43.088]  I know a lot of people that struggle with it, I myself, and I've been trying for a really long time and I know everything that I've read says to ease off of it, but by the time you ease off of it and the medicine starts to work again and then you just take more.
[02:12:44.208 --> 02:12:48.451]  I don't know if Dr. Group could suggest a regimen to come off of them.
[02:12:48.531 --> 02:12:49.891]  Boy, this is a big question.
[02:12:49.931 --> 02:12:51.993]  The age-old thing of how to get off opiates.
[02:12:53.774 --> 02:12:56.675]  Whoever figures that out is going to win the Nobel Prize.
[02:12:56.695 --> 02:13:00.077]  Well, actually, you get the Nobel Prize for committing evil now, so I guess you wouldn't.
[02:13:00.097 --> 02:13:01.578]  You'd probably get assassinated.
[02:13:02.318 --> 02:13:04.099]  But I know there are things you can do with supplements.
[02:13:05.180 --> 02:13:12.670]  Herbs and things I know that they've proven can help block some of the addiction and that even Big Pharma is trying to patent some of that now.
[02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:18.918]  Dr. Group, what would you do to get off, say, hillbilly heroin, Oxycontin?
[02:13:19.929 --> 02:13:35.824]  Well, we've actually had a lot of good success with that and it all stems back to cleansing the body starting with intestinal cleansing with oxy powder and then moving on to liver and gallbladder cleansing because you have to remember those pain medications will cause you to become constipated.
[02:13:36.644 --> 02:13:40.988]  And once you clean your intestines... Yeah, a lot of opiates do that because I've never really taken them except when I'm on a broken leg or whatever.
[02:13:41.249 --> 02:13:45.573]  But I always hear about heroin heads and people like don't go to the bathroom but every two weeks.
[02:13:46.994 --> 02:13:57.056]  Well, because it alters the neurological contractions or the normal contractions of the muscles that surround the intestinal lining, it kind of numbs the nerves.
[02:13:57.076 --> 02:14:01.577]  That's why they're pain medications, because they numb the nerves so you can't feel the pain.
[02:14:01.977 --> 02:14:07.999]  Well, you have tiny thousands and millions and millions of these little nerve endings all the way down through your intestinal lining.
[02:14:08.419 --> 02:14:13.020]  So, because you're taking an opiate, because you're taking medications, most likely
[02:14:13.820 --> 02:14:18.466]  The majority of people that are taking pain medications or any medications are not eating healthy.
[02:14:19.207 --> 02:14:21.590]  These things numb the nerves.
[02:14:21.670 --> 02:14:32.002]  They leak through the intestinal lining through leaky gut syndrome and then you become constipated because you're not able to create that normal peristaltic movement in the bowel.
[02:14:32.022 --> 02:14:33.184]  What a nightmare drug!
[02:14:34.451 --> 02:14:37.153]  Yes, but you can eventually get off of those.
[02:14:37.233 --> 02:14:57.471]  One of the things, vitamin D, like the winter sun, it's amazing what that does for healing joint and I don't know why you're in pain to begin with, but some of the newest research has come out on 20,000 IUs of vitamin D. There was a doctor, a research scientist, that wrote a book called The Miraculous Healing Benefits of D3.
[02:14:57.491 --> 02:14:58.212]  Actually,
[02:15:01.181 --> 02:15:02.441]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:15:22.099 --> 02:15:22.359]  Yes.
[02:15:22.739 --> 02:15:28.641]  Actually, D3 is a hormone, and I really didn't think it was that necessary.
[02:15:28.681 --> 02:15:30.561]  I figured we were getting enough in the sun.
[02:15:31.101 --> 02:15:43.744]  But as our research continued, I realized that there was also a conspiracy or an attack on blocking the UVB rays with all the chemtrails, and that pretty much we're all deficient or not getting enough D in the body as well.
[02:15:43.825 --> 02:15:45.425]  But that led me to looking at
[02:15:45.845 --> 02:15:52.512]  You know, there's thousands upon thousands of studies on the effects of D, and that's another thing I think everybody is deficient in and everybody needs.
[02:15:52.532 --> 02:16:00.359]  So, I would highly recommend, if anyone's on prescription medications, whether it's pain medications or whatever, there are solutions.
[02:16:00.419 --> 02:16:07.606]  And one thing with opiates is you have to get off of gluten when you're slowly
[02:16:08.848 --> 02:16:11.470]  It's called time-contingent detoxification.
[02:16:11.851 --> 02:16:13.112]  You don't want to cold turkey it.
[02:16:13.152 --> 02:16:17.277]  You want to slowly start reducing it, reducing it, reducing it over a period of time.
[02:16:17.297 --> 02:16:18.198]  Wow, this is really important.
[02:16:18.218 --> 02:16:24.225]  I want to have you on for a whole show about gluten because even in mainline literature they admit now that it mimics opiates.
[02:16:24.745 --> 02:16:25.726]  That's a whole other subject.
[02:16:25.846 --> 02:16:29.691]  How is grain mimicking poppy seeds?
[02:16:32.623 --> 02:16:36.047]  It's just, they're just finding new things about it all the time.
[02:16:36.087 --> 02:16:49.163]  I mean, I can't remember the chemical name of it, but yeah, I was just not too long ago reading some information that gluten actually does have an opiate-like compound in it, and that's what makes bread so addictive.
[02:16:49.784 --> 02:16:54.007]  That's why it makes you so calm and feel so good when you eat a big, you know, loaf of bread at the steakhouse.
[02:16:54.388 --> 02:16:55.669]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:16:55.769 --> 02:16:58.911]  And it also, you also go through withdrawals when you get off of it.
[02:16:59.231 --> 02:17:01.933]  It makes you crave it again, so you get more and more of it.
[02:17:02.574 --> 02:17:04.615]  So that's something that needs to be... Amazing.
[02:17:04.635 --> 02:17:07.097]  We've got to go in a few minutes because our next guest is coming up.
[02:17:07.418 --> 02:17:08.799]  Dr. Ripa, I appreciate all your time.
[02:17:08.819 --> 02:17:12.882]  Let's move quickly now to Felicia in Oregon.
[02:17:12.922 --> 02:17:15.784]  And again, they've got the call thing way back so I can barely read.
[02:17:15.804 --> 02:17:16.404]  I'm not complaining.
[02:17:16.445 --> 02:17:18.006]  It's just, that's why I'm butchering the names.
[02:17:18.586 --> 02:17:18.846]  Go ahead.
[02:17:18.866 --> 02:17:19.347]  You're on the air.
[02:17:20.683 --> 02:17:30.585]  Hi, about a year ago after starting the X2, I developed symptoms that almost started, you know, resulted in surgery.
[02:17:31.005 --> 02:17:40.207]  But then it ended up I had Hashimoto's, and I was told that the iodine is what made that condition flare, you know, the autoimmune response to start.
[02:17:40.747 --> 02:17:48.869]  And I wanted to know what your opinion was and if I could resume taking iodine, and if not, how can I keep that part of my system straight?
[02:17:51.058 --> 02:18:05.304]  Well, I don't know too much about your history and everything, but I have not heard, and I also refer to Dr. Brownstein's research on Hashimoto's hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.
[02:18:06.004 --> 02:18:13.747]  And I haven't had a case, and I don't think Dr. Brownstein has either, of iodine, a good source of iodine ever causing a
[02:18:15.988 --> 02:18:16.128]  Yes.
[02:18:36.494 --> 02:18:53.420]  The bromine starts releasing and the other halogens, which can alter different types of thyroid... I was about to say, if it makes your body push out all the toxins that have built up, and we know that it hits women harder, then that could have been the response, kind of like cleaning a filter out.
[02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:58.081]  I mean, if you ever clean the filter in your fish tank, you do it wrong, it dumps all the crap into the fish tank.
[02:18:58.741 --> 02:19:06.523]  And so, I mean, that's why I've said that people should consult their physician before using this stuff, because you've got all these bad halogens in there, and you're now going to be messing with that.
[02:19:06.943 --> 02:19:07.623]  You know, who knows?
[02:19:08.283 --> 02:19:18.265]  What happens is, when you start taking it, you might have hypothyroid, you might have hyper, you might have Hashimoto's for a period of time, and that's just your thyroid getting rid of anything.
[02:19:18.285 --> 02:19:21.746]  The problem is that the doctors, when they do thyroid panels, or when they do
[02:19:22.646 --> 02:19:28.871]  Most doctors never test for iodine anyway, but even the ones that do, they don't test for bromine.
[02:19:28.931 --> 02:19:40.639]  So you get false positive results, and so in order to rebalance the thyroid... Exactly, they don't test for the bad halogens, they'll blame iodine because you've got so much of the other stuff in you.
[02:19:40.659 --> 02:19:41.400]  I read about that.
[02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:49.506]  So probably... Because again, that's medical doctors that are always, and of course Brownstein is a medical doctor, but who just don't understand it.
[02:19:50.353 --> 02:19:54.236]  So probably at that one point in time you went in to have your thyroid checked or something.
[02:19:54.256 --> 02:19:55.136]  I don't know what happened.
[02:19:55.757 --> 02:20:05.504]  And Hashimoto's is nothing more than a roller coaster of your thyroid going up and down, which is completely normal in a lot of times with people starting on iodine.
[02:20:05.564 --> 02:20:07.905]  So they might have
[02:20:08.726 --> 02:20:13.468]  You know, misdiagnosed you or might have said, you know... Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[02:20:13.488 --> 02:20:23.491]  We're out of time, but that's a really important question because I'll be in restaurants, I'll be at church, I'll be just everywhere for years and I see women talking about their thyroids, young, old.
[02:20:23.831 --> 02:20:26.852]  I see women everywhere who aren't fat but have a swollen goiter.
[02:20:27.432 --> 02:20:31.034]  Like we had in the 20s and 30s when we didn't have iodine in the salt.
[02:20:31.894 --> 02:20:32.974]  Of course they've taken it out again.
[02:20:33.475 --> 02:20:34.895]  Why is it hitting women?
[02:20:35.075 --> 02:20:41.838]  And of course they admit that in the news, that women are more heavily hit than others by thyroid problems.
[02:20:41.898 --> 02:20:43.159]  Why is there an epidemic of that?
[02:20:45.063 --> 02:21:03.175]  Well, women have a larger thyroid gland anyway, and iodine really likes to deposit itself in the reproductive areas, and women have breasts, which are, you know, a lot more surface area than guys, and so iodine likes to accumulate in there.
[02:21:03.255 --> 02:21:14.142]  Women have their menstrual cycles, which are changes in their hormonal patterns, and if they don't have enough iodine, they can have, you know, harder symptoms of PMS, endometriosis,
[02:21:15.883 --> 02:21:19.047]  Women just have a tendency to have more reproductive problems than men.
[02:21:19.107 --> 02:21:23.531]  They have ovaries, they have eggs, they have a whole cycle that goes on all the time.
[02:21:23.612 --> 02:21:29.278]  So, iodine deficiency really affects women a lot more than it does men.
[02:21:31.055 --> 02:21:33.098]  Well again, everybody's body is different.
[02:21:33.438 --> 02:21:37.905]  Is it possible, because people can be allergic to, you know, cabbage.
[02:21:37.925 --> 02:21:39.967]  They can be allergic to anything.
[02:21:40.728 --> 02:21:47.798]  Is it possible, that's why I always say check with a physician, that some people could be allergic to pure iodine?
[02:21:48.439 --> 02:21:56.924]  I mean, I know you'll die without it, but... So, I don't think if you have a receptor on every single cell in your body for a substance that you could ever be allergic to it.
[02:21:57.404 --> 02:22:09.571]  What happens is sometimes the bowel is in such bad shape that it might be taken with something else or something else might be inside the bowel at the time that might cause a reaction or inflammation.
[02:22:09.992 --> 02:22:15.035]  But as far as looking at a monatomic or looking at a detoxified type of iodine,
[02:22:15.715 --> 02:22:29.827]  And knowing that you have every single cell in your body has an iodine receptor, to me it would be absolutely impossible the way that God designed it for you to be, have an allergy to iodine in its detoxified form.
[02:22:30.027 --> 02:22:36.753]  Alright, we've got to have you back up sooner to just take a full hour of calls because we've got Jim wants to talk about fibromyalgia that's exploding.
[02:22:37.214 --> 02:22:39.275]  David wants to talk about his medications.
[02:22:39.335 --> 02:22:40.657]  Tim wants to talk about heart problems.
[02:22:41.157 --> 02:22:42.838]  Sean is a pharmacist.
[02:22:43.839 --> 02:22:46.180]  I want to start with Dr. Group on a health issue.
[02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:48.940]  Joey wants to talk about winter sun, vitamin D question.
[02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:51.441]  But I'm going to, even though we've got our next guest, I pushed him back.
[02:22:51.481 --> 02:22:52.161]  I apologize.
[02:22:52.381 --> 02:22:56.402]  We'll go to Sean and then to have a final question because Sean's a pharmacist.
[02:22:56.442 --> 02:22:58.763]  I want to hear what Sean has to say from Canada.
[02:22:59.023 --> 02:23:00.383]  Sean, you're on the air with Dr. Group.
[02:23:00.403 --> 02:23:00.743]  Go ahead.
[02:23:02.244 --> 02:23:02.884]  Yes, sir.
[02:23:03.264 --> 02:23:07.805]  I'm a first-time caller and greatly appreciate the opportunity to finally talk with you, Alex.
[02:23:09.185 --> 02:23:12.086]  I've actually had experience working both in Canada and the U.S.
[02:23:13.363 --> 02:23:19.750]  And I just wanted to ask Dr. Group about his opinion on healthcare in Canada versus the U.S.
[02:23:19.870 --> 02:23:23.334]  I'm not sure if you're familiar with it in Canada, but here in the U.S.
[02:23:23.374 --> 02:23:24.595]  I've worked here in the U.S.
[02:23:24.996 --> 02:23:27.158]  and the prices are just astronomical.
[02:23:28.380 --> 02:23:34.126]  It's not really a free market and I wanted to know what you thought about that because
[02:23:35.123 --> 02:23:42.051]  We're talking about drugs that are 30 or 40 years old that are marked up 50 to even a thousand percent.
[02:23:42.091 --> 02:23:43.152]  Sure, I thought the U.S.
[02:23:43.172 --> 02:23:44.814]  was the worst about gouging for drugs.
[02:23:44.834 --> 02:23:45.995]  You're saying Canada's worst?
[02:23:47.217 --> 02:23:48.999]  No, actually, no, no, I'm not, sir.
[02:23:49.039 --> 02:23:49.900]  What I'm saying is that
[02:23:50.686 --> 02:24:00.008]  It's like a drug such as, maybe Dr. Group can comment on this, but I mean a drug such as Daclofenac which is basically a topical anti-inflammatory.
[02:24:00.488 --> 02:24:06.710]  I could go to Canada to one of my buddy's pharmacies and buy it for about $100 but when I was working here in the U.S.
[02:24:06.810 --> 02:24:10.491]  dispensing it in the drive-thru to a patient on workers' compensation,
[02:24:11.343 --> 02:24:13.507]  I mean, the drug was more than $1,400.
[02:24:14.108 --> 02:24:15.850]  No, that's a whole other issue.
[02:24:16.031 --> 02:24:17.693]  Absolutely, that's a whole other issue.
[02:24:18.114 --> 02:24:19.236]  Why does the U.S.
[02:24:19.256 --> 02:24:21.399]  have the highest drug cost in the world?
[02:24:21.439 --> 02:24:22.701]  Dr. Griff, that's a good way to end it.
[02:24:22.742 --> 02:24:23.262]  Thank you, Sean.
[02:24:24.110 --> 02:24:33.756]  Well, in short, that we don't technically have a health care system here or we don't have a health care system in Canada or anywhere where there's pharmaceuticals.
[02:24:33.776 --> 02:24:37.578]  We have a death or a disease management care system.
[02:24:38.118 --> 02:24:45.642]  And until they realize that we need to address the root cause of disease and the root cause of mental illness, it's going to stay that way.
[02:24:46.883 --> 02:24:50.784]  And the reason why the drugs are so expensive is because it's all a money game.
[02:24:50.824 --> 02:24:55.566]  It's all about how much money they can make, and the insurance companies are tied in with the pharmaceutical companies.
[02:24:55.926 --> 02:25:07.050]  And not only that, they're tied in with the big organizations like Susan B. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, American Cancer Society, and all the 501c corporations that people donate money to.
[02:25:07.130 --> 02:25:14.493]  So they take money from you every single way they can and make you feel bad and make you think that they're going to come up with a cure, but they never will.
[02:25:14.653 --> 02:25:17.075]  All right, Dr. Group, globalhealingcenter.com.
[02:25:17.115 --> 02:25:18.075]  Thank you so much for the time.
[02:25:18.716 --> 02:25:19.096]  Thank you.
[02:25:19.116 --> 02:25:23.158]  We're gonna get our next guest on now to balance the hour, a little bit into the next hour of Overdrive.
[02:25:23.499 --> 02:25:28.462]  If you can stay with us on a super important topic, the attack on the First Amendment and free speech globally.
[02:25:28.982 --> 02:25:39.148]  Look, I'm no rocket scientist, but I do read a lot of studies and research and talk to medical doctors and nutritionists, and I try to really have a well-rounded understanding of things.
[02:25:39.789 --> 02:25:41.330]  If you've got a screwed up thyroid,
[02:25:42.534 --> 02:25:44.678]  Which a lot of people have from all the bad halogens.
[02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:48.925]  And you start taking iodine and it's going to push that out?
[02:25:49.366 --> 02:25:51.209]  That just sounds like that could inflame it to me.
[02:25:52.709 --> 02:25:54.531]  But you do want to get that stuff out.
[02:25:54.551 --> 02:26:01.177]  But it's kind of like if you drink, you know, a bottle of Jack Daniels every day and you finally quit, you're going to go through the detoxes.
[02:26:01.518 --> 02:26:02.959]  So you might want to do it gradually.
[02:26:03.539 --> 02:26:04.801]  And I'm not giving medical advice here.
[02:26:04.821 --> 02:26:09.025]  I'm just saying if I had some kind of thyroid problem, I'd want to get all the bad halogens out.
[02:26:09.525 --> 02:26:15.471]  I'd probably start personally with a very small dose and just see what happened and let that stuff come out of there slowly.
[02:26:16.890 --> 02:26:23.234]  Uh, because, you know, when a gland or something is already screwed up, messing with it, uh, with something really hardcore.
[02:26:23.254 --> 02:26:23.934]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:26:24.315 --> 02:26:33.540]  Survival Shield X2, uh, we, I tried to develop with group a iodine that was more palatable and not as toxic tasting and bad on the gut as the other stuff out there being sold.
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:34.781]  Cause I knew it was important.
[02:26:34.801 --> 02:26:37.583]  I knew it was giving me energy, stamina, making me feel better.
[02:26:38.163 --> 02:26:41.285]  You know, just having iodine, period, because of deficiencies.
[02:26:41.705 --> 02:26:54.712]  So I wanted the best, the purest, the cleanest, but look, we're in such a screwed up, intricate, manipulated world that there are no silver bullets in any of this.
[02:26:54.852 --> 02:26:58.894]  I mean, it's like, I had family die of infections a year and a half ago.
[02:26:58.954 --> 02:26:59.774]  Three family members.
[02:26:59.834 --> 02:27:01.335]  It was going all over Texas, killing folks.
[02:27:02.175 --> 02:27:02.796]  An uncle,
[02:27:03.908 --> 02:27:05.049]  A great uncle and a cousin.
[02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:09.893]  And, um, you know, I know silver in the levels I took it was toxic.
[02:27:10.154 --> 02:27:12.275]  I couldn't get rid of this chest cold.
[02:27:12.616 --> 02:27:13.476]  Antibiotics didn't work.
[02:27:14.397 --> 02:27:15.718]  A little bit of colloidal silver didn't work.
[02:27:16.779 --> 02:27:20.583]  I drank three bottles of colloidal silver in one week.
[02:27:21.604 --> 02:27:23.926]  That's just a... I'm not telling you to do that.
[02:27:23.946 --> 02:27:24.786]  That is toxic.
[02:27:25.687 --> 02:27:26.168]  Guess what?
[02:27:27.509 --> 02:27:29.591]  Within two days when I drunk the first bottle,
[02:27:30.427 --> 02:27:31.167]  It was gone.
[02:27:31.447 --> 02:27:36.770]  The burning, the pain, the bacteria in my throat I couldn't get rid of.
[02:27:36.810 --> 02:27:37.810]  The bleeding at night.
[02:27:37.830 --> 02:27:39.391]  I mean, just excruciating pain.
[02:27:39.771 --> 02:27:40.551]  Down into my lungs.
[02:27:41.872 --> 02:27:42.632]  Guzzle the bottle.
[02:27:45.273 --> 02:27:45.853]  Kept going.
[02:27:46.753 --> 02:27:46.994]  Boom.
[02:27:47.254 --> 02:27:48.754]  You know, my pee was green though, folks.
[02:27:48.814 --> 02:27:50.395]  I mean, I don't know how good that was for my kidneys.
[02:27:50.835 --> 02:27:51.435]  I mean, who knows?
[02:27:51.455 --> 02:27:55.297]  The point is, I mean, silver kills stuff because it's poisonous.
[02:27:58.356 --> 02:28:01.317]  You fight fire with fire, but there is no silver bullet.
[02:28:03.478 --> 02:28:04.238]  That's what I'm telling you.
[02:28:04.278 --> 02:28:05.518]  This stuff is real.
[02:28:05.838 --> 02:28:07.639]  The stuff we sell isn't a game.
[02:28:09.559 --> 02:28:18.462]  Supernova Vitality is concentrated cold-pressed herbs that are known to kickstart your body.
[02:28:19.540 --> 02:28:24.602]  I mean, everybody I've talked to has, except for one guy that I've talked to, massive effect.
[02:28:24.622 --> 02:28:26.663]  I mean, you'll notice it within days when you wake up in the morning.
[02:28:27.263 --> 02:28:35.007]  I don't have to explain what that means, but it's because we've already been jacked with and screwed over by the fluoride and the chemicals and the GMO.
[02:28:35.027 --> 02:28:40.789]  We're already screwed up, so trying to get it back on track is a research project.
[02:28:41.389 --> 02:28:43.670]  We're all guinea pigs in the West.
[02:28:45.351 --> 02:28:47.172]  We're all guinea pigs in the West.
[02:28:49.784 --> 02:28:54.045]  And so, trying to find a way out of it isn't going to be perfect.
[02:28:56.066 --> 02:28:57.947]  I know I'm not going to just sit here and take it, though.
[02:28:58.587 --> 02:29:01.668]  I know I've lost 60 pounds in the last three years.
[02:29:01.688 --> 02:29:06.210]  And you're like, well, I mean, you don't look super fat, but you still look like you've got a few pounds on you.
[02:29:06.650 --> 02:29:08.850]  Man, let me tell you, I gained 99 pounds.
[02:29:10.911 --> 02:29:11.231]  99 pounds.
[02:29:11.291 --> 02:29:12.252]  I've lost 60 plus.
[02:29:13.552 --> 02:29:17.153]  And you've seen the photos online, what I look like now.
[02:29:17.173 --> 02:29:19.014]  I mean, I barely have a tiny potbelly.
[02:29:20.481 --> 02:29:26.028]  When I'm sitting down, there's almost no fat on my legs, almost no fat on my back, and almost no fat on my arms now.
[02:29:27.750 --> 02:29:29.071]  It's amazing, and I've done it.
[02:29:29.732 --> 02:29:39.003]  I was doing more exercise actually, jogging, swimming every other day, like a mile or two miles, and I lost about 30 pounds.
[02:29:40.971 --> 02:29:48.196]  I went on Supermail Vitality and ForgeLive.com and it just took me to that next level.
[02:29:48.216 --> 02:29:50.938]  And it was because I had deficiencies in all those areas.
[02:29:50.958 --> 02:29:58.043]  We're going to come back, get into the attack on free speech worldwide, key TPP news, with LiveLeak.com founder Hayden Hewitt.
[02:29:59.824 --> 02:30:02.826]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.747 --> 02:30:06.429]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:11.067 --> 02:30:24.160]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[02:30:25.461 --> 02:30:37.230]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[02:30:37.450 --> 02:30:53.742]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[02:30:54.162 --> 02:30:58.745]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming, it's already here.
[02:30:59.185 --> 02:31:02.927]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance.

[02:31:10.032 --> 02:31:15.036]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:31:15.176 --> 02:31:21.060]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:31:21.300 --> 02:31:25.883]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:31:26.063 --> 02:31:29.406]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:31:29.646 --> 02:31:31.227]  No needles, no injections.
[02:31:31.627 --> 02:31:36.751]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:31:39.913 --> 02:31:40.534]  Alex Jones here.
[02:31:40.914 --> 02:31:49.979]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:31:50.219 --> 02:31:53.721]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[02:31:54.022 --> 02:32:02.006]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[02:32:02.347 --> 02:32:04.648]  Visit Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:32:04.668 --> 02:32:05.709]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:09.731 --> 02:32:12.173]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:12.373 --> 02:32:13.393]  Check it out today.
[02:32:13.874 --> 02:32:22.059]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none, and that's what you'll find at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:22.259 --> 02:32:29.303]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest
[02:32:29.383 --> 02:32:30.023]  We're good to go.
[02:32:50.168 --> 02:32:50.709]  We're good.
[02:33:20.954 --> 02:33:25.097]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:33:25.858 --> 02:33:43.011]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:43.351 --> 02:33:47.234]  Joining us is Hayden Hewitt, co-founder of LiveLeak.com.
[02:33:48.689 --> 02:33:59.916]  And we've used other services out there, and quite frankly, when we'd get 100,000, 200,000, 300,000, a million people on our stream, they would kick us off.
[02:34:00.497 --> 02:34:02.838]  I guess they didn't want to actually have all those viewers.
[02:34:03.839 --> 02:34:09.543]  But LiveLeak reached out to us a few years ago for our Bilderberg coverage and said, we'll give you the streams you need.
[02:34:10.023 --> 02:34:15.006]  So we'll have LiveLeak coverage from Austria with our three reporters if they're able to get in.
[02:34:16.307 --> 02:34:20.211]  They're on some of the InfoWars channels that are on LiveLeak.
[02:34:20.251 --> 02:34:28.179]  In fact, we should probably today go to some of those channels and give people those addresses, but they'll be embedded at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:28.739 --> 02:34:36.306]  Anna Hayden is involved in the TV production as well over in the UK, and I appreciate him coming on.
[02:34:36.606 --> 02:34:40.830]  LiveLeak is a UK-based video sharing website that lets users post and share videos.
[02:34:41.471 --> 02:34:48.316]  Founded in October of 2006 by a team responsible for the Orgish.com shock site.
[02:34:48.336 --> 02:34:55.341]  It aims to take reality footage, politics, war, and other world events and combine them with the power of citizen journalism.
[02:34:55.821 --> 02:34:56.802]  LiveLeak.com.
[02:34:57.603 --> 02:34:59.224]  What I like is they haven't censored us.
[02:35:00.204 --> 02:35:08.931]  I mean, we wouldn't even be putting anything profane or violent up on some of the other streaming sites and it was like government or something would have them shut us down.
[02:35:09.855 --> 02:35:11.676]  And it happened over and over again with other services.
[02:35:12.076 --> 02:35:15.078]  We've finally gotten to a point where YouTube isn't censoring us too much.
[02:35:15.098 --> 02:35:19.201]  I think that's because they're in competition now with Facebook video that's starting to rise.
[02:35:19.281 --> 02:35:22.063]  But it's good to have independent groups out there.
[02:35:22.783 --> 02:35:25.845]  Hayden, thank you for coming on with us, LiveLeak.com.
[02:35:27.186 --> 02:35:31.849]  I know you're read up on the attacks on free speech globally, TPP and more.
[02:35:32.629 --> 02:35:38.793]  But first off, for folks that don't know who you are, tell us a little bit about your worldview and what you think is happening right now on the planet.
[02:35:40.229 --> 02:35:52.179]  Um, well, you kind of have to use your language carefully a lot of the time, but it's quite simple that where TPP and TTIP are concerned, what we're looking at is a corporate takeover of sovereign nations.
[02:35:52.379 --> 02:35:54.341]  There's no other way to put it.
[02:35:54.381 --> 02:35:56.122]  If you boil it down, that's all it is.
[02:35:56.883 --> 02:36:02.848]  Our sovereign nations are going to hand over their ability to rule themselves to corporations, willingly.
[02:36:04.549 --> 02:36:05.230]  It's incredible.
[02:36:05.490 --> 02:36:07.632]  Wow, your Skype is amazing.
[02:36:08.976 --> 02:36:09.236]  Is it?
[02:36:09.316 --> 02:36:09.716]  Oh, good!
[02:36:10.897 --> 02:36:14.880]  Usually, for us and for the show, it doesn't work at all, so I'm very pleased it's working now.
[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:15.480]  Well, fantastic.
[02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:17.761]  You're involved not just in LiveLeak that you co-founded.
[02:36:18.262 --> 02:36:19.522]  You produce other shows and things.
[02:36:19.582 --> 02:36:22.264]  I mean, let's face it, you're kind of battling the new world order, aren't you?
[02:36:24.025 --> 02:36:25.146]  In our own little way.
[02:36:26.326 --> 02:36:29.769]  I am a director of a very small media company.
[02:36:29.829 --> 02:36:35.812]  We provide services to small, medium businesses who can't traditionally afford those sort of services.
[02:36:36.333 --> 02:36:37.113]  We're even trying to get
[02:36:39.472 --> 02:36:40.974]  A campaign up and running for that.
[02:36:41.074 --> 02:36:58.195]  But on the side, because we have this equipment, this knowledge, we've decided that we need to reach out to people like Richie Allen, who is one of the first shows, and help people who are passionate about these sort of things and people who have a belief in something, whether we agree personally or not, completely irrelevant, much like Live.ly.
[02:36:59.701 --> 02:37:03.183]  And provide them with a platform to be heard.
[02:37:03.203 --> 02:37:04.884]  Well, that's true.
[02:37:04.924 --> 02:37:13.849]  Remaissance, though, just providing a medium for true censorship-free freedom, that ends up helping almost every time.
[02:37:14.949 --> 02:37:22.856]  Yeah, I mean, as long as it's legal and doesn't encourage doing people actual harm, whether I agree or not, like I say, it's completely irrelevant.
[02:37:23.477 --> 02:37:25.399]  I don't have to agree with people to support them.
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:35.868]  Seems in this day and age there's a lot of you're with us or against us sort of thing, but I support people I disagree with almost constantly, but isn't that what it's about?
[02:37:36.349 --> 02:37:38.451]  If you don't, you're playing somebody else's game.
[02:37:39.124 --> 02:37:44.206]  Well, that's a classically liberal view, the opposite of these modern liberal and conservative paradigm.
[02:37:45.006 --> 02:37:48.908]  Let's get into TPP and now new documents from WikiLeaks.
[02:37:49.308 --> 02:37:50.569]  It's even worse than we thought.
[02:37:50.689 --> 02:37:54.810]  All of our private data just turned over to multinationals.
[02:37:55.270 --> 02:37:57.411]  These corporations are really arrogant.
[02:37:57.451 --> 02:38:01.293]  I mean, how do they think they're going to get away with this long term, ruling us from secret?
[02:38:02.406 --> 02:38:06.749]  Because our, air quotes, leaders will allow it.
[02:38:07.610 --> 02:38:09.952]  Powerful lobbyists have been working on this for a long time.
[02:38:10.092 --> 02:38:19.920]  Let's be honest, everybody's favourite alternative news kicking boys, Monsanto, they tried to release certain products in Europe and they were told no.
[02:38:21.050 --> 02:38:22.571]  Unusually, there was no fight.
[02:38:22.892 --> 02:38:23.652]  They just backed off.
[02:38:24.473 --> 02:38:25.734]  Because they know TTIP's coming.
[02:38:26.295 --> 02:38:29.998]  And they can just sue the hell out of nations until nations can't afford it.
[02:38:30.619 --> 02:38:39.347]  By the time people realise what this actually means, because it's such a, let's face it, for the mainstream viewer it's an incredibly dull sounding topic, isn't it?
[02:38:39.367 --> 02:38:40.087]  Especially when you've got
[02:38:40.948 --> 02:38:43.852]  Bruce Jenner in the news with his smashing new pair of breasts.
[02:38:44.632 --> 02:38:46.795]  Much more interesting than TPP.
[02:38:46.815 --> 02:38:57.087]  And by the time people realise most of this type of legislation and a lot of the creeping horrific legislation we've got coming around the corner in the UK, it's too late.
[02:38:57.247 --> 02:38:59.410]  And generally people are quite apathetic now.
[02:39:01.468 --> 02:39:02.828]  Man, you ought to do a show of your own.
[02:39:02.848 --> 02:39:03.409]  I mean, I know you do.
[02:39:03.429 --> 02:39:11.631]  You have a great radio voice and also a great brain when it comes down to this, because you're just calmly laying out in like a minute or two what I've been screaming about, you know, for hours.
[02:39:12.911 --> 02:39:13.812]  But I get upset.
[02:39:13.872 --> 02:39:24.755]  It's so Orwellian and surreal that foreign corporations can be trying to make my life go under them, and I can't even see what they're secretly doing.
[02:39:25.075 --> 02:39:27.016]  And the mainstream media acts like that's OK.
[02:39:27.096 --> 02:39:28.416]  I mean, that is just crazy.
[02:39:28.696 --> 02:39:30.977]  Where do you think they're going to go next if they get away with this?
[02:39:31.983 --> 02:39:37.264]  Alex is, I think, it's not even, not to contradict, it's not even really Orwellian, it's more Huxley.
[02:39:37.644 --> 02:39:38.164]  It is, yeah.
[02:39:38.564 --> 02:39:41.945]  They're making it seem like a wonderful thing, and people are going, oh that's nice.
[02:39:42.405 --> 02:39:46.806]  You're right, it is Huxley, because Huxley, it's making tyranny look sexy, that's what it's all about.
[02:39:46.846 --> 02:39:48.606]  1984, you know it's tyranny.
[02:39:48.626 --> 02:39:52.687]  They're protecting us, Alex, they're protecting us from people that hate our freedoms.
[02:39:53.107 --> 02:39:56.848]  Luckily, those people shouldn't hate us much longer, because we don't have a hell of a lot of freedoms left.
[02:39:58.274 --> 02:40:03.221]  Yeah, Bush always said they attack us because they had our freedom, then why is the government killing our freedom?
[02:40:04.107 --> 02:40:06.149]  Yeah, well, because they want everyone to love us.
[02:40:07.369 --> 02:40:09.511]  I mean, that's how they sell everything now, isn't it?
[02:40:09.551 --> 02:40:10.832]  We'll protect you from terrorists.
[02:40:11.232 --> 02:40:12.673]  Don't worry, we'll touch you at the airport.
[02:40:12.714 --> 02:40:14.215]  We're protecting you from terrorists.
[02:40:14.595 --> 02:40:15.676]  We're gonna read all your emails.
[02:40:15.696 --> 02:40:17.437]  We're protecting you from terrorists.
[02:40:17.937 --> 02:40:18.618]  Everything we do.
[02:40:18.678 --> 02:40:19.839]  No, you don't need freedom.
[02:40:20.539 --> 02:40:22.621]  You don't need freedom because we're protecting you from terrorists.
[02:40:23.061 --> 02:40:24.623]  Alex, I come out my house every day.
[02:40:25.243 --> 02:40:26.404]  I go to a corner shop.
[02:40:26.484 --> 02:40:27.365]  There's an Asian guy there.
[02:40:27.545 --> 02:40:28.485]  Never blown up once.
[02:40:29.366 --> 02:40:37.272]  I've not seen a single member of the Taliban or ISIS on my road, and I don't think it's because we're fighting them over there or because the government have taken my freedoms.
[02:40:37.332 --> 02:40:42.316]  It's just this sale of fear so they can grab everything we've got that's ours.
[02:40:43.177 --> 02:40:43.877]  Well, that's it.
[02:40:43.897 --> 02:40:48.221]  And then trying to create a real radical threat, they fund ISIS and other groups.
[02:40:48.261 --> 02:40:49.562]  Here's the headline from yesterday.
[02:40:50.702 --> 02:40:51.023]  U.S.
[02:40:51.103 --> 02:40:53.164]  now claims Assad working with ISIS.
[02:40:53.244 --> 02:40:54.365]  Infowars.com.
[02:40:54.825 --> 02:40:55.146]  U.S.
[02:40:55.626 --> 02:40:59.649]  changes narrative after Pentagon report proves ISIS to be Western-backed.
[02:40:59.709 --> 02:41:00.329]  And then the U.S.
[02:41:00.389 --> 02:41:07.395]  Embassy tweeted, reports indicate the regime of Assad is making airstrikes in support of ISIL.
[02:41:08.462 --> 02:41:14.149]  The Islamic State of ISIS against Aleppo, aiding extremists against Syrian population.
[02:41:14.229 --> 02:41:18.034]  That is, that is, that is Orwellian.
[02:41:18.554 --> 02:41:20.036]  That is war is peace.
[02:41:20.156 --> 02:41:21.277]  I mean, that is crazy.
[02:41:22.017 --> 02:41:26.139]  Anyone with a pair of eyes can see that Assad and ISIS have really gotten along well over the years.
[02:41:29.061 --> 02:41:30.161]  People are going to read this!
[02:41:30.281 --> 02:41:34.704]  It's like when the situation in Syria first really got going.
[02:41:35.484 --> 02:41:37.986]  We were being sold the narrative through the media that it's Assad
[02:41:38.946 --> 02:41:39.587]  Uh, the bad guy.
[02:41:39.927 --> 02:41:40.427]  Fair enough.
[02:41:40.908 --> 02:41:42.129]  Not the nicest of rulers.
[02:41:42.989 --> 02:41:44.671]  And it was a popular uprising.
[02:41:44.771 --> 02:41:47.673]  Let's arm the- These aren't the extreme extremists.
[02:41:47.713 --> 02:41:49.835]  These are the not-quite-so-extreme extremists.
[02:41:49.875 --> 02:41:50.636]  These are our friends.
[02:41:50.916 --> 02:41:56.560]  We helped create ISIS, and we empowered them, and we were being sold this narrative that they were the good guys.
[02:41:56.620 --> 02:42:04.447]  And on LiveLeak, very early in the conflict, we started getting a lot of footage, which very clearly spelled out that there were no good guys in this conflict.
[02:42:05.827 --> 02:42:14.769]  And now, look at what it's grown into, and we've had people like Tony Blair, the Middle East Peace Envoy, saying, no, we didn't, we're not responsible for ISIS.
[02:42:15.069 --> 02:42:16.610]  Yeah, of course we are.
[02:42:16.630 --> 02:42:28.013]  Well, I even predicted two years ago, before they even made up the name ISIS out of Al-Qaeda, that when they were done, they would claim that Assad was with the bad rebels, which are the majority of the rebels, and now they've done it.
[02:42:29.333 --> 02:42:37.275]  ISIS, the Salafists, Al Qaeda, same group, through Saudi Arabia, have been trying to overthrow Assad for five years, who is a reformer compared to his dad.
[02:42:37.535 --> 02:42:39.776]  He's not an angel, but compared to ISIS he is.
[02:42:40.096 --> 02:42:46.178]  People can live in peace, all different religions, they're wearing suits and ties, you can listen to whatever music you want, you can get a beer.
[02:42:47.038 --> 02:42:51.341]  I mean, that's more freedom than what we see under these crazy people.
[02:42:51.762 --> 02:42:57.466]  And they've got the nerve now to... I just can't believe that our government is now saying Assad is with ISIS.
[02:42:58.527 --> 02:43:01.669]  Do you think they're testing to see if we're dumb, or will people buy this?
[02:43:02.350 --> 02:43:03.711]  I think they know people.
[02:43:04.551 --> 02:43:14.079]  A, when they're sat at home in the comfort of the chair like, you know, in the UK watching Britain's Got Talent, the biggest story in the newspapers last week was that a dog won a talent show.
[02:43:14.679 --> 02:43:14.899]  Yeah.
[02:43:15.580 --> 02:43:16.481]  They don't care!
[02:43:16.541 --> 02:43:17.282]  You're sat at home.
[02:43:17.342 --> 02:43:18.543]  Your life's okay.
[02:43:18.903 --> 02:43:24.669]  Remember, most people, TPP, they won't even notice it until it really gets its teeth in or teet it.
[02:43:25.430 --> 02:43:26.611]  They won't really notice it.
[02:43:26.631 --> 02:43:28.693]  Their lives will kind of continue on a groove.
[02:43:29.074 --> 02:43:29.995]  It's not that they're sheep.
[02:43:30.836 --> 02:43:36.081]  Most people want to get up, go to work, go home, spend time with the family, like I'm sure you do.
[02:43:36.141 --> 02:43:36.722]  I know I do.
[02:43:37.918 --> 02:43:40.579]  But you don't tend to think generational.
[02:43:41.100 --> 02:43:42.240]  I'm terrified.
[02:43:42.860 --> 02:43:44.021]  I've got a three-year-old son.
[02:43:44.381 --> 02:43:50.764]  I'm terrified that he's going to grow up in a world which has been spelled out by our dear leader over here in the UK.
[02:43:51.525 --> 02:43:52.605]  We can't say anything.
[02:43:53.386 --> 02:43:57.108]  Oh yeah, tell folks about Cameron's latest statement that is Orwellian.
[02:43:57.128 --> 02:43:59.749]  I mean, the quote is so insane.
[02:44:00.669 --> 02:44:01.470]  And this is the best part?
[02:44:01.530 --> 02:44:01.710]  Okay.
[02:44:02.510 --> 02:44:04.851]  I can't quite exactly, I don't have it in front of me.
[02:44:04.891 --> 02:44:05.472]  We can pull it up.
[02:44:07.375 --> 02:44:11.999]  Essentially, they're going to clamp down on non-violent extremism.
[02:44:13.681 --> 02:44:20.548]  Ask them what it is, they're kind of vague, but one example he gave, and if this isn't terrifying, I don't know what is.
[02:44:20.568 --> 02:44:27.555]  9-11 conspiracy theories are an example of something that could lead people to terrorism.
[02:44:28.939 --> 02:44:34.540]  Now I think personally he's making quite a leap there because I don't think it's good.
[02:44:34.820 --> 02:44:47.963]  But even if it did, if one or two people turn to terrorism after religiously following 9-11 conspiracy theory websites and the like, is that worth criminalising the millions of people who are interested in the topic?
[02:44:48.703 --> 02:44:50.004]  Here's what they're going to do in the UK.
[02:44:50.044 --> 02:44:51.144]  They will take away
[02:44:52.475 --> 02:44:54.856]  Your right to use the internet, essentially.
[02:44:54.876 --> 02:45:01.758]  If you get one of these banning orders for being a non-violent extremist, if you want to use Twitter, it has to go through the police.
[02:45:02.698 --> 02:45:07.860]  And you won't be allowed to tell anyone why all of a sudden you've changed dramatically online.
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:13.862]  Or why your tweets are being written by, you know, a Tim Potash's police officer.
[02:45:13.882 --> 02:45:19.864]  And even better, the prospect, and this is amazing,
[02:45:20.930 --> 02:45:25.834]  That you could be arrested and tried without necessarily being told what it is you've done.
[02:45:26.314 --> 02:45:29.957]  Now, I know I've read a book about that, quite a famous one, I'm sure you have.
[02:45:30.338 --> 02:45:32.620]  And it appears David Cameron and his people did too, unfortunately.
[02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:34.121]  Let me read the quote to folks.
[02:45:34.861 --> 02:45:35.882]  And here's the problem.
[02:45:35.982 --> 02:45:40.927]  I'm too close to this, and so are you, being somebody who's informed, Hayden.
[02:45:41.934 --> 02:45:50.503]  But we're here saying things that 50 years ago, 20 years ago, would have been heralding the end of freedom, the end of the West, the end of free speech.
[02:45:51.364 --> 02:45:57.950]  I mean, they're saying that if you say 9-11 was a cover-up, you're aiding terrorists.
[02:45:58.091 --> 02:45:58.831]  Well, no you're not.
[02:45:58.871 --> 02:46:01.814]  You're saying the government's aiding terrorists, which is actually coming out.
[02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:07.844]  So they're saying, and I've already been harassed in the UK by police when I'm just out interviewing people, asking me what I'm doing.
[02:46:08.364 --> 02:46:09.645]  So they've already been getting this ready.
[02:46:10.105 --> 02:46:12.146]  And protest bans downtown, the rest of it.
[02:46:12.727 --> 02:46:22.033]  And now he's saying, quote, for too long we have been passively tolerant society, saying to our citizens, as long as you obey the law, we will leave you alone.
[02:46:22.473 --> 02:46:26.416]  It's often meant we have stood neutral between different values.
[02:46:26.996 --> 02:46:30.259]  And that's helped foster a narrative of extremism and grievance.
[02:46:30.959 --> 02:46:32.260]  And then if you go on to the full quote,
[02:46:33.322 --> 02:46:34.104]  The government will
[02:46:35.222 --> 02:46:37.843]  Conclusively, turn the page on this failed approach.
[02:46:38.003 --> 02:46:39.224]  That's Magna Carta, folks.
[02:46:39.824 --> 02:46:51.448]  As the party of one nation, talk about a cult, we are one nation, we will govern as one nation, that means you'll do what they say, bring our country together, that means actively promoting certain values.
[02:46:51.828 --> 02:46:57.470]  Freedom of speech, freedom of worship, democracy, the rule of law, equal rights regardless of race, gender, or sexuality.
[02:46:57.830 --> 02:47:03.112]  And then later in the quote, because it's a long speech, he says, we will no longer tolerate criticism of the government.
[02:47:03.132 --> 02:47:03.913]  Let me see where it says that.
[02:47:04.813 --> 02:47:14.942]  The government will challenge those who seek to spread hatred and intolerance by forming a new partnership of every person and organization, that's common purpose, in this country that wants to defeat the extremists.
[02:47:15.363 --> 02:47:22.569]  The proposal around the response, and then he just goes in, and then you read him say, we will no longer tolerate, you know, people saying hateful things.
[02:47:22.769 --> 02:47:28.694]  Well that sounds nice, except they then mean 9-11 conspiracy theorists.
[02:47:28.714 --> 02:47:28.975]  Go ahead.
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:31.101]  Not just that.
[02:47:31.521 --> 02:47:35.685]  When they say hateful things, it's probably not my definition of hateful.
[02:47:36.666 --> 02:47:38.187]  It's their definition of hateful.
[02:47:38.687 --> 02:47:43.511]  It's so vaguely worded that when challenged, members of government
[02:47:44.434 --> 02:47:48.137]  I mean, let's be honest, politicians will never give you an answer anyway, about anything.
[02:47:48.778 --> 02:47:50.860]  But they just simply don't know.
[02:47:51.501 --> 02:47:59.268]  These blanket laws, of course, people like Sepp Kershaw, newspapers like the Daily Mail, saying, well, pretty much, it's for your own safety.
[02:47:59.628 --> 02:48:00.289]  It's for your own good.
[02:48:00.329 --> 02:48:04.993]  We will live in this utopian dream world of everyone being nice.
[02:48:05.533 --> 02:48:09.097]  You never, ever got rid of any problem by brushing it under the carpet.
[02:48:10.711 --> 02:48:13.194]  You can't do that so long before there's big lumps in the carpet.
[02:48:13.815 --> 02:48:15.817]  Look who they're trying to shut up.
[02:48:15.938 --> 02:48:21.244]  Folks that want to criticize the EU, people that want to call for sovereignty, people that don't like GMO.
[02:48:21.745 --> 02:48:24.328]  That's who they want to go after, not even the radical Islamists.
[02:48:24.589 --> 02:48:28.093]  They're going to use that threat to take everybody else's freedom.
[02:48:28.113 --> 02:48:29.254]  That's always been the plan.
[02:48:30.031 --> 02:48:31.791]  Yeah, and it goes right through society.
[02:48:31.832 --> 02:48:41.134]  The National Union of Students, which is always... See, it's tricky because I am definitely very liberal, but perhaps not a liberal by the modern sense of the word.
[02:48:41.194 --> 02:48:41.454]  Sure.
[02:48:41.614 --> 02:48:43.955]  But the National Union of Students has always been extremely left.
[02:48:43.975 --> 02:48:49.316]  But recently, they wouldn't condemn ISIS because that would be racist.
[02:48:49.456 --> 02:48:51.397]  Although I'm not entirely sure what race ISIS is.
[02:48:51.797 --> 02:48:54.778]  But that would be racist, so we can't condemn ISIS for that.
[02:48:55.658 --> 02:48:59.060]  But we can condemn Israel, because that's not racist.
[02:49:00.941 --> 02:49:06.183]  We can also condemn gay men for co-opting expressions used by black females.
[02:49:06.203 --> 02:49:07.744]  We can definitely condemn that.
[02:49:08.044 --> 02:49:10.566]  But we can't condemn the guys doing the raping and the murdering.
[02:49:10.586 --> 02:49:17.129]  So it's all this... It really is the definition of political correctness gone mad, a phrase that's often used very poorly.
[02:49:17.549 --> 02:49:20.911]  But this is definitely being used... That's right, it's all selectively enforced.
[02:49:21.874 --> 02:49:22.334]  Of course!
[02:49:22.894 --> 02:49:23.534]  Of course it is.
[02:49:23.695 --> 02:49:25.715]  The milking it for everything it's worth.
[02:49:25.775 --> 02:49:32.957]  The government have seen a tremendous in, aided by people's irrational fear of bearded lunatics in sandals exploding everywhere.
[02:49:33.817 --> 02:49:38.419]  And the current zeitgeist they're thinking amongst them are younger people and their leaders.
[02:49:39.099 --> 02:49:44.640]  Well, after World War II, the British and the UK refused to carry ID cards and said it was Nazi Germany.
[02:49:45.100 --> 02:49:50.482]  And when Hitler was bombing the UK, bombing London, people didn't give up and say, let's give in.
[02:49:50.822 --> 02:49:55.304]  I mean, if there were real terrorists blowing us up every day, it's still not as dangerous as automobiles.
[02:49:55.724 --> 02:49:57.524]  We don't get rid of cars because they're dangerous.
[02:49:57.544 --> 02:50:04.087]  I mean, this idea that because somebody's threatening to bomb us, we change our whole way of life, that's just ridiculous.
[02:50:04.707 --> 02:50:13.130]  It even goes back even more recently, when the troubles with the IRA were at their peak in this country, British security services went to the government saying, we want
[02:50:14.491 --> 02:50:16.036]  Way more far-reaching powers.
[02:50:16.076 --> 02:50:21.653]  We want to be able to get everyone, and the governments at the time, across all parties, said, oh no, we can't do that.
[02:50:23.450 --> 02:50:24.531]  We can't do that.
[02:50:24.591 --> 02:50:25.552]  That's what they want.
[02:50:26.212 --> 02:50:28.254]  So, frankly, the war on terror is now lost.
[02:50:28.934 --> 02:50:30.416]  If there was ever such a thing, it's lost.
[02:50:30.476 --> 02:50:34.859]  The terrorists have won without destroying one of our major cities.
[02:50:34.999 --> 02:50:43.805]  They've won because we're frantically handing over freedoms at a ridiculous rate and handing over our countries to corporations.
[02:50:45.787 --> 02:50:51.052]  I never thought there'd be anyone I trusted less or any body I trusted less than politicians to rule us.
[02:50:51.572 --> 02:50:52.132]  But there are.
[02:50:52.193 --> 02:50:53.354]  There are corporations.
[02:50:53.594 --> 02:50:54.735]  Secret corporations.
[02:50:54.795 --> 02:50:55.536]  Secret agreements.
[02:50:55.936 --> 02:50:56.436]  Hayden Hewitt.
[02:50:56.456 --> 02:50:57.497]  That's the best part.
[02:50:57.697 --> 02:50:58.398]  Arbitration.
[02:50:58.959 --> 02:50:59.599]  Absolutely.
[02:50:59.659 --> 02:51:00.780]  Final segment coming up.
[02:51:00.860 --> 02:51:01.921]  Or perhaps some overdrive.
[02:51:01.961 --> 02:51:03.603]  LiveLeak.com Hayden Hewitt.
[02:51:04.003 --> 02:51:06.345]  I want to get him back on in the very near future.
[02:51:06.365 --> 02:51:09.568]  We're going to give you some more of those David Cameron quotes when we come back.
[02:51:10.791 --> 02:51:12.533]  What's your health worth to you?
[02:51:12.834 --> 02:51:18.120]  You probably can't place an exact value on it, but its importance has certainly increased greatly as you've grown older.
[02:51:18.341 --> 02:51:22.666]  Yet some companies seem to believe you can be lured in with cheap prices and false promises.
[02:51:22.907 --> 02:51:26.251]  That's never been the way Supernatural Silver has chosen to do business.
[02:51:26.511 --> 02:51:31.554]  Long ago, we set out to create a product that was light years beyond colloidal and ionic silver.
[02:51:31.794 --> 02:51:38.257]  Through extensive research and testing, we succeeded in making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective.
[02:51:38.377 --> 02:51:42.980]  Some might call us a premium product, but we simply strive to be a product that worked.
[02:51:43.260 --> 02:51:50.944]  Supernatural silver is strong enough to fight off viruses, bacteria, and fungus, but safe enough to be used internally or topically.
[02:51:51.184 --> 02:51:58.027]  And it's powerful enough that just a handful of applications per week can give you better results than the daily use of those bargain silvers.
[02:51:58.287 --> 02:52:05.131]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com today and use the promo code SILVER2015 for 30% off your order.

[02:52:10.633 --> 02:52:14.698]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[02:52:14.738 --> 02:52:17.741]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[02:52:17.941 --> 02:52:19.303]  Does that sound right to you?
[02:52:19.563 --> 02:52:22.606]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:52:22.907 --> 02:52:23.848]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:52:24.408 --> 02:52:25.530]  Just won't quit.
[02:52:26.431 --> 02:52:28.353]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[02:52:28.613 --> 02:52:33.138]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[02:52:41.653 --> 02:52:42.453]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:52:42.473 --> 02:52:43.954]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:52:44.254 --> 02:52:45.535]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:52:45.895 --> 02:52:48.237]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:52:48.717 --> 02:52:50.578]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:52:51.018 --> 02:52:55.061]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:52:55.521 --> 02:52:59.243]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:52:59.463 --> 02:53:02.925]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.

[02:53:03.685 --> 02:53:05.306]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:53:10.771 --> 02:53:12.552]  Are you suffering from EP?
[02:53:12.872 --> 02:53:15.693]  The symptoms include fraudulent charges to your credit card.
[02:53:15.774 --> 02:53:18.135]  Your subway card says it's empty, but you bought it yesterday.
[02:53:18.395 --> 02:53:22.917]  Someone's been in your hotel room, but the desk clerk says they only show you entering the room.
[02:53:23.177 --> 02:53:24.678]  These are signs of EP.
[02:53:24.958 --> 02:53:26.399]  Electronic pickpocketing.
[02:53:26.599 --> 02:53:29.420]  Payment cards, transit cards, even hotel room keys.
[02:53:29.720 --> 02:53:34.883]  Use a radio chip so you can just wave your card at the register, the turnstile, or your hotel room door.
[02:53:35.043 --> 02:53:38.965]  But what's convenient for you is also convenient for thieves, waving scanners,
[02:53:38.985 --> 02:53:39.485]  I think so.
[02:54:00.643 --> 02:54:05.029]  Warning, ID Stronghold wallets could lead to feelings of safety and security, comfort in crowds, and euphoria.
[02:54:05.129 --> 02:54:09.916]  If you experience these emotions, immediately inform your friends and family about IDStronghold.com so they can feel better too.
[02:54:13.590 --> 02:54:18.193]  I want to have Hayden Hewitt, the co-founder of LiveLeak.com, back on in the very near future.
[02:54:18.213 --> 02:54:19.754]  He's a great interviewer, really smart guy.
[02:54:19.774 --> 02:54:23.756]  I'm going to be out in the UK in a few months working on a big story.
[02:54:23.796 --> 02:54:25.798]  Maybe I can come by his offices and check out what they're doing.
[02:54:25.818 --> 02:54:27.158]  They've done a lot of exciting things.
[02:54:27.839 --> 02:54:31.341]  They'll be with us for five more minutes into overdrive, but the main transmission is going to be over soon.
[02:54:31.761 --> 02:54:33.622]  Nightly News is tonight, 7 o'clock.
[02:54:33.683 --> 02:54:37.405]  I did find the full quote in his speech.
[02:54:39.252 --> 02:54:41.493]  From the British Prime Minister just two weeks ago.
[02:54:41.833 --> 02:54:52.175]  For far too long, this is in his speech, we have been passively tolerant society, saying to our citizens, as long as you obey the law, we will leave you alone.
[02:54:52.795 --> 02:54:55.456]  It's often meant we have stood neutral between different values.
[02:54:55.956 --> 02:54:58.577]  And that's helped foster a narrative of extremism and grievance.
[02:54:59.677 --> 02:55:02.598]  This government will conclusively turn the page on this failed approach.
[02:55:04.184 --> 02:55:06.065]  And even the Liberal Guardian breaks this down.
[02:55:06.425 --> 02:55:09.446]  This will be used on Conservatives, Libertarians, and everybody else for that matter.
[02:55:11.267 --> 02:55:19.571]  Designed to restrict those trying to radicalize young people, they claim it's for radical Muslims, it's not, is to be included in the Queen's speech.
[02:55:19.611 --> 02:55:22.132]  David Cameron will tell the National Security Council on Wednesday.
[02:55:22.992 --> 02:55:32.477]  Any activities that are quote, the high court will rule, harmful activities of an extremist individual, which they define, the definition of harmful is to include a risk of public disorder,
[02:55:33.365 --> 02:55:35.386]  Or a risk of harassment, alarm, or distress.
[02:55:35.946 --> 02:55:38.447]  You know, saying the government's behind terror attacks, that's pretty distressing.
[02:55:38.888 --> 02:55:40.448]  A threat to the functioning of democracy.
[02:55:41.249 --> 02:55:48.872]  They would include a ban on broadcasting and a requirement to submit to the police, is what he just talked about, in advance any proposed publication.
[02:55:49.392 --> 02:55:51.693]  That is the true form of censorship, prior restraint.
[02:55:52.394 --> 02:55:54.414]  On the web and social media or in print.
[02:55:54.815 --> 02:55:59.057]  The bill will also contain plans for banning orders for extremist organizations.
[02:55:59.457 --> 02:56:01.578]  Yeah, like Michael Savage can't come to the UK
[02:56:02.975 --> 02:56:04.977]  Or even guys that just teach self-defense.
[02:56:05.177 --> 02:56:05.537]  Famous.
[02:56:06.318 --> 02:56:08.059]  You know, Navy SEALs and stuff can't go there.
[02:56:08.980 --> 02:56:12.303]  Because they're trying to ban... In fact, they just had the police come out this week.
[02:56:12.323 --> 02:56:13.764]  I meant to cover it on Monday, it was in the news.
[02:56:14.145 --> 02:56:18.508]  And say, because they asked the police in a public forum, is any self-defense okay?
[02:56:18.528 --> 02:56:19.790]  And they said, no, it's all illegal.
[02:56:20.130 --> 02:56:24.634]  Only a rape alarm, a panic alarm, a horn is okay.
[02:56:26.249 --> 02:56:30.890]  I mean, why do you think the UK, out of all countries, wants this docile population?
[02:56:31.250 --> 02:56:34.751]  What's going on, LiveLeak co-founder Hayden Hewitt?
[02:56:36.211 --> 02:56:40.852]  I think that the thing about the rape alarm was kind of taken a touch out of context, to be fair.
[02:56:41.332 --> 02:56:44.152]  I think it's about that's what weapon, you can't carry weapons in this country.
[02:56:44.172 --> 02:56:53.754]  I mean, just recently, I think it was Manchester or Salford, which is an adjoining city, a guy stabbed a burglar to death and, you know, it was considered self-defense.
[02:56:55.573 --> 02:57:00.836]  I think there's a little bit of clickbaiting and selective reporting involved there.
[02:57:01.537 --> 02:57:17.907]  But the big thing with what you just spoke about there, do you remember when people were first concerned about the amount of surveillance, where our security services were spying on your people, your security services were spying on our people, and thereby avoiding all the rules about spying on your own people?
[02:57:19.164 --> 02:57:25.205]  And everyone, or many people would say, well, it's okay, if you've done nothing wrong, you've got nothing to fear.
[02:57:25.985 --> 02:57:27.526]  That's kind of changing now, isn't it?
[02:57:27.546 --> 02:57:33.387]  Because Cameron's basically saying, doesn't matter what you've done, you've probably got something to fear.
[02:57:33.407 --> 02:57:41.428]  You know, that thing you were doing that was okay yesterday is not okay today, but we might not tell you why we're arresting you for it.
[02:57:41.969 --> 02:57:43.929]  And yet still, nobody's terrified.
[02:57:46.144 --> 02:57:47.325]  And now they're going to try to roll it out.
[02:57:47.465 --> 02:57:51.388]  Why do you think governments are moving so fast towards classical authoritarianism?
[02:57:53.429 --> 02:58:04.917]  I imagine, and I don't have great experience in government, I'm very pleased to say, once you've got a bit between your teeth, and it looks like you can get to the sort of goal you want,
[02:58:06.198 --> 02:58:06.978]  Why waste time?
[02:58:07.539 --> 02:58:26.888]  The quicker you move, like many things in life, you know, with a business opportunity or anything like that, move quick, you know, after careful consideration, when you do move, you move as fast as you can to ensure that it happens with this little interference, like Obama trying to railroad to the TPP thing.
[02:58:27.308 --> 02:58:31.350]  Again, I'm just, I'm literally, I'll be talking about this on the Live League Show later.
[02:58:31.370 --> 02:58:34.032]  The White House can find time to mention
[02:58:35.152 --> 02:58:36.293]  Bruce Jenner, for example.
[02:58:37.374 --> 02:58:41.076]  Which should be of no relevance to anyone, what that man does with his own body.
[02:58:41.357 --> 02:58:43.638]  And we're not against Bruce Jenner.
[02:58:43.658 --> 02:58:48.922]  It's just not... Why are we obsessing on a... Stay with us, back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:48.942 --> 02:58:50.163]  I want to elaborate on that.
[02:58:50.483 --> 02:58:51.264]  Planet Jenner.
[02:58:51.324 --> 02:58:52.945]  I mean, this is not the top story.
[02:58:53.405 --> 02:58:55.767]  Trying to start World War III with Russia and China is.
[02:58:56.527 --> 02:58:57.248]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:57.268 --> 02:58:57.648]  Stay with us.
[02:59:00.692 --> 02:59:05.694]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[02:59:31.563 --> 02:59:40.646]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:59:40.846 --> 02:59:44.308]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[03:00:03.070 --> 03:00:05.677]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.197 --> 03:00:19.218]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:19.838 --> 03:00:22.859]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:23.319 --> 03:00:25.639]  We're going to keep doing overdrive until about 20 after.
[03:00:25.659 --> 03:00:30.840]  If Hayden Hewitt has to go because he runs a whole bunch of important stuff, he can or he can stay with us until 20 after.
[03:00:31.080 --> 03:00:33.160]  This is a 5-minute segment, 12-minute segment coming up.
[03:00:33.941 --> 03:00:41.442]  But I tell you, CJ is in there ranting to me during the breaks about Bruce Jenner and what's really behind all this.
[03:00:42.322 --> 03:00:43.503]  And it really made a lot of sense.
[03:00:43.523 --> 03:00:48.785]  He's going to talk about that in the next segment, kind of reload and repeat what he just said to me during that 70-second break.
[03:00:48.825 --> 03:00:56.809]  But Hayden, you were talking about Bruce Jenner and all this, and why is Obama talking about it when you got cut off by the break?
[03:00:56.849 --> 03:00:57.189]  Go ahead.
[03:00:58.129 --> 03:01:04.112]  Yeah, well, you know, I understand the cult of celebrities is huge now, and we love what we can laugh and we call reality shows.
[03:01:04.772 --> 03:01:05.232]  It's massive.
[03:01:05.252 --> 03:01:06.333]  It's a huge distraction.
[03:01:06.493 --> 03:01:06.953]  People love it.
[03:01:07.593 --> 03:01:08.254]  But in truth,
[03:01:09.107 --> 03:01:12.190]  There's no reason to care what Bruce Jenner does with his body.
[03:01:12.370 --> 03:01:13.171]  It's irrelevant.
[03:01:13.351 --> 03:01:16.033]  You know, the things behind it, that's a different debate.
[03:01:16.774 --> 03:01:25.081]  The fact that the White House, the most powerful man in the world to all intents and purposes, can have a chat about Bruce Jenner.
[03:01:26.172 --> 03:01:31.353]  But at no point we'll clue the American people in on legislation that will affect them for generations.
[03:01:31.873 --> 03:01:32.634]  The TPP?
[03:01:33.394 --> 03:01:34.454]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:01:34.474 --> 03:01:41.015]  England's falling to tyranny, we're falling to tyranny, the whole planet is, and we're talking about a guy that turned into a woman.
[03:01:41.056 --> 03:01:43.036]  And they're like, oh, you just don't like that.
[03:01:43.276 --> 03:01:44.056]  I don't care!
[03:01:44.076 --> 03:01:49.578]  I'm a total libertarian, but it's like, why am I being force-fed an ugly tranny?
[03:01:49.758 --> 03:01:51.298]  I mean, I just don't get it!
[03:01:53.626 --> 03:02:02.296]  Well, I mean, that's a whole nother debate I would love to have with you sometime about people's perceptions and the way we have a completely polarised society now.
[03:02:02.737 --> 03:02:08.083]  You either are A or B. Yeah, he's a goddess, she's a goddess, she's an abomination.
[03:02:08.504 --> 03:02:11.687]  Nobody's allowed nowadays to take the middle ground and go, you know what, don't care.
[03:02:12.475 --> 03:02:13.716]  No, I mean, that's where I'm at.
[03:02:14.097 --> 03:02:15.498]  I mean, that's where I'm at.
[03:02:16.199 --> 03:02:20.322]  I mean, if some guy turned into a woman like Meryl Monroe, I'd be like, wow, that guy looks like a good-looking woman.
[03:02:20.643 --> 03:02:27.029]  I mean, but it's just, it's so weird that it's a creepy Olympic athlete, and I can't stand the Kardashians in reality.
[03:02:27.049 --> 03:02:27.930]  I just hate it all.
[03:02:28.470 --> 03:02:36.172]  It's not that I hate, you know, the Kardashians themselves, I hate the whole spectacle, because it is a distraction from the TPP, and everything else!
[03:02:36.832 --> 03:02:38.213]  It's a distraction from everything.
[03:02:38.253 --> 03:02:42.874]  Reality TV is... I mean, we don't watch a lot of television in my house.
[03:02:42.934 --> 03:02:45.535]  It's not a snobbery thing, it's not, you know... I don't either.
[03:02:45.635 --> 03:02:51.997]  I'll have a chat with the wife, we'll catch up on the day, then, you know, I'll do a bit of reading, she'll potter on the internet.
[03:02:52.097 --> 03:02:55.018]  I tend not to potter around on the internet much at home, because that's my entire life.
[03:02:55.954 --> 03:03:06.839]  Um, but we don't watch a lot of TV, and when we do, I constantly find myself amazed at just the complete lack of information that's available on television now.
[03:03:07.139 --> 03:03:08.420]  It's kind of scary.
[03:03:08.860 --> 03:03:11.121]  Oh yeah, once you go internet, you can't go back.
[03:03:11.181 --> 03:03:13.902]  I mean, I never watch television anymore.
[03:03:14.742 --> 03:03:15.743]  How can you watch the news?
[03:03:15.863 --> 03:03:21.525]  I turned on the ITV, which is independent television news here in the UK.
[03:03:22.506 --> 03:03:24.867]  I turned that on, I had to sit through 20 minutes of FIFA.
[03:03:25.782 --> 03:03:25.962]  Yeah.
[03:03:26.943 --> 03:03:27.644]  So what?
[03:03:27.704 --> 03:03:28.724]  It's corrupt.
[03:03:29.365 --> 03:03:29.986]  No kidding.
[03:03:30.306 --> 03:03:35.150]  A huge organization responsible for billions of, hundreds of billions of pounds income is corrupt.
[03:03:35.510 --> 03:03:36.151]  No kidding.
[03:03:36.711 --> 03:03:38.933]  But, why would, who didn't know?
[03:03:38.993 --> 03:03:39.974]  Now, alright, let us know.
[03:03:40.014 --> 03:03:42.736]  Yeah, the Soccer Association is not capturing our countries.
[03:03:43.917 --> 03:03:50.923]  No, as far as I know, FIFA wouldn't slap an order on me to not speak online without being vetted by a police officer.
[03:03:51.991 --> 03:03:53.332]  They might want to, I don't know.
[03:03:53.352 --> 03:03:57.375]  By the way, what's going to happen to LiveLeak if Cameron actually gets all this through?
[03:03:57.395 --> 03:03:58.936]  They're going to put prior restraint on you.
[03:03:58.956 --> 03:04:00.137]  You're going to have to move somewhere else.
[03:04:01.098 --> 03:04:06.282]  Well, LiveLeak isn't... I know it's written on Wikipedia, but we didn't write that because we actually follow the Wiki rules.
[03:04:06.322 --> 03:04:08.064]  We don't edit anything about our own stuff.
[03:04:08.104 --> 03:04:09.224]  So you're not really based in the UK?
[03:04:10.045 --> 03:04:11.506]  No, I'm based in the UK.
[03:04:12.047 --> 03:04:17.151]  LiveLeak is a very, very unusual organization in as much as it's a genuine cooperative.
[03:04:17.912 --> 03:04:18.112]  Yeah.
[03:04:18.252 --> 03:04:19.233]  There's no single head.
[03:04:19.673 --> 03:04:24.396]  I just drew the straw that I'm out from talking to people and, you know, because I enjoy it.
[03:04:24.416 --> 03:04:26.357]  There's no head to chop off because there is no head.
[03:04:27.237 --> 03:04:33.901]  No, I mean, it's, you know, it's a very, like I say, there's no shiny building with chrome.
[03:04:33.921 --> 03:04:37.564]  There's no sort of shiny suited investors.
[03:04:37.764 --> 03:04:38.904]  There's nothing like that.
[03:04:38.944 --> 03:04:41.386]  He's a genuine independent entity.
[03:04:42.361 --> 03:04:45.103]  That's why we don't all have Ferraris, Monocles and fur coats.
[03:04:45.424 --> 03:04:46.625]  You know?
[03:04:46.725 --> 03:04:47.025]  Hold on.
[03:04:47.045 --> 03:04:49.307]  Hey, do you have to go or can you do one more segment?
[03:04:50.148 --> 03:04:51.048]  I'll do one more segment.
[03:04:51.068 --> 03:04:52.029]  Alright, alright, great.
[03:04:52.489 --> 03:04:54.331]  Hayden Hewitt, LiveLeak.com.
[03:04:55.192 --> 03:04:55.992]  It's a great site.
[03:04:56.012 --> 03:04:58.374]  I mean, you want to know where I watch TV, it's places like that.
[03:04:59.856 --> 03:05:01.897]  Because YouTube is so commercialized and stuff.
[03:05:02.117 --> 03:05:03.419]  And I'm not even against people having ads.
[03:05:03.439 --> 03:05:04.099]  I mean, we have them too.
[03:05:04.139 --> 03:05:08.483]  It's just that I like to go over there because you can find some really interesting real human stuff at LiveLeak.

[03:06:10.552 --> 03:06:26.971]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[03:06:27.212 --> 03:06:30.716]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[03:06:31.036 --> 03:06:34.718]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[03:06:34.958 --> 03:06:36.359]  hdfirearms.com.
[03:06:36.639 --> 03:06:39.861]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.

[03:07:18.937 --> 03:07:22.758]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[03:07:23.118 --> 03:07:25.019]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[03:07:25.059 --> 03:07:27.341]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[03:07:27.481 --> 03:07:35.225]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[03:08:12.614 --> 03:08:14.555]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[03:08:15.015 --> 03:08:15.495]  A lie!
[03:08:15.915 --> 03:08:17.616]  No man is obsolete!
[03:08:17.916 --> 03:08:19.757]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[03:08:19.797 --> 03:08:22.678]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[03:08:23.038 --> 03:08:28.120]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[03:08:28.480 --> 03:08:30.140]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[03:08:30.180 --> 03:08:31.261]  A crawling insect!
[03:08:31.901 --> 03:08:35.725]  Ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[03:08:36.326 --> 03:08:37.447]  I am a human being!
[03:08:37.847 --> 03:08:45.075]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[03:08:45.595 --> 03:08:46.316]  I don't care!
[03:08:46.736 --> 03:08:47.757]  I tell you, I don't care!
[03:08:47.777 --> 03:08:49.880]  I'm a human being, I exist!
[03:08:49.980 --> 03:08:54.104]  And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives!
[03:08:54.827 --> 03:08:56.588]  Even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[03:08:57.028 --> 03:08:59.748]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[03:09:00.188 --> 03:09:07.610]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all!
[03:09:07.870 --> 03:09:13.272]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the state has no use for your kind!
[03:09:14.952 --> 03:09:18.433]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:09:19.013 --> 03:09:20.734]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:09:22.029 --> 03:09:26.891]  Well into overdrive as we simulcast over 170 Eminem affiliates across the United States.
[03:09:27.711 --> 03:09:30.312]  And of course go out over the internet at Infowars.com.
[03:09:31.032 --> 03:09:32.673]  The free podcast and so much more.
[03:09:33.353 --> 03:09:39.015]  And you, the viewer, the listener, you have the power to reach more people by telling them about Infowars.com and everything we do.
[03:09:39.035 --> 03:09:43.577]  And we're a platform trying to tell folks about other groups and organizations and platforms.
[03:09:43.997 --> 03:09:47.138]  Everybody out there should go start your own LiveLeak.com platform.
[03:09:48.433 --> 03:09:51.396]  And then doppelganger videos, put them over on YouTube and somewhere else.
[03:09:51.456 --> 03:09:53.257]  Just reach out.
[03:09:53.397 --> 03:09:53.978]  Communicate.
[03:09:53.998 --> 03:09:55.599]  That doesn't mean you have all the answers.
[03:09:55.679 --> 03:09:56.140]  I don't either.
[03:09:56.160 --> 03:10:02.365]  I don't care what color you are or you're a man or a woman or Caitlyn Jenner, Bruce Jenner, whatever.
[03:10:03.308 --> 03:10:19.834]  Hayden Hewitt, LiveLeak.com co-founder, is our guest for the rest of this 12-minute segment, but CJ in the control room, who I always encourage the guys to rant on air when they want to say something, not just tell me during the break, but I guess they don't want to seem uppity, he really crystallized it.
[03:10:19.874 --> 03:10:29.798]  He said, look, it's not about hormones, it's not about agendas, it's about money, and he really boiled it down in about a 60-second rant during a break.
[03:10:29.838 --> 03:10:30.999]  So go ahead, CJ.
[03:10:32.096 --> 03:10:34.818]  I'll try to paraphrase what I said without paraphrasing too much.
[03:10:35.278 --> 03:10:37.359]  And then cut out the cuss words, but just go ahead.
[03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:43.343]  Nothing too bad, but we know that there's only a handful of companies that own all media organizations.
[03:10:44.204 --> 03:10:46.645]  Viacom, Disney, News Corp.
[03:10:46.665 --> 03:10:49.707]  If I can go through a list, it's not very big.
[03:10:49.827 --> 03:10:50.507]  There's five of them.
[03:10:50.988 --> 03:10:52.969]  Yeah, so Bruce is on E!
[03:10:54.750 --> 03:10:56.152]  Chris's husband, basically.
[03:10:56.232 --> 03:10:58.634]  He was an Olympian, but he's not in the news.
[03:10:58.714 --> 03:11:01.417]  It's not like the tabloids have Bruce all over the place.
[03:11:01.437 --> 03:11:06.823]  They've got Kim and Jay-Z and tons of ad revenue based on them.
[03:11:07.804 --> 03:11:15.192]  And it turns out Bruce could get $10,000 speaking engagement, but now that he's Caitlyn, he's getting upwards of $100,000.
[03:11:18.826 --> 03:11:28.195]  It's a small price to pay getting a boob job and a sex change, but he's gonna be making millions for himself and billions for that handful of corporations.
[03:11:28.355 --> 03:11:34.500]  While they sell this idea to everybody just to create more confusion and kind of you don't accept it, you hate them.
[03:11:34.580 --> 03:11:42.908]  Well yeah, you're a monster, a bigot, if you don't love Caitlyn and think she's the greatest gift to humanity since Kim.
[03:11:43.228 --> 03:11:47.170]  And then all over the country they make you pay for people's sex changes.
[03:11:47.210 --> 03:11:49.071]  You're going to see an explosion in this.
[03:11:49.772 --> 03:11:51.953]  And really it's just a revolution of weirdness.
[03:11:52.593 --> 03:11:53.194]  It's nothing new.
[03:11:54.110 --> 03:12:04.176]  I was saying that Chaz Bono, which was Sonny Bono and Cher's daughter, or son, became Chastity.
[03:12:04.216 --> 03:12:10.259]  I can't remember which way it was, but it happened almost a decade or more than a decade ago and it was no big deal.
[03:12:10.739 --> 03:12:12.360]  It wasn't like it was a great social event.
[03:12:12.380 --> 03:12:20.465]  Well, what this really is is an example of how the mainstream media doesn't have the influence it once had in news, but it's still there in entertainment.
[03:12:20.485 --> 03:12:21.686]  They still have the big numbers there.
[03:12:22.566 --> 03:12:25.667]  And they can just create a new personality.
[03:12:26.467 --> 03:12:31.008]  I've seen this guy give interviews with this lady, and it's just super boring.
[03:12:31.048 --> 03:12:32.368]  It's like watching paint dry.
[03:12:32.388 --> 03:12:42.630]  And so they can just take this, and then go, oh, how glamorous, a goddess, worship it, and it looks like a creepy, narcissistic, 60-year-old woman.
[03:12:42.930 --> 03:12:50.171]  I mean, I don't want to watch a creepy, narcissistic, you know, I mean, I don't sit around reading glamour magazines with, you know, it's just all, it's annoying.
[03:12:51.051 --> 03:12:52.592]  And it's the force feeding of this.
[03:12:52.632 --> 03:12:53.332]  Thank you, CJ.
[03:12:53.372 --> 03:12:54.233]  Anything else you want to add?
[03:12:55.313 --> 03:13:09.681]  Well, I was going to add one more point that you have these interviews with people like Diane Sawyer or Oprah and we had the fallen Lance Armstrong because people looked up to him and so when he had a failure, a major lie, it was
[03:13:11.044 --> 03:13:29.039]  Devastating to the world, but Bruce is a Athlete and nobody really looks up to him as an athlete anymore, but now they look at him like he's courageous and ESPN's given him a courage award and There's a female basketball player.
[03:13:29.059 --> 03:13:40.047]  I can't remember name, but she died of cancer and did all this work to raise awareness and money and was completely overlooked and it's just sad that we live in a society that awards a
[03:13:41.269 --> 03:13:47.451]  Some call mental illness, some call corporate gold digging with Courage Awards.
[03:13:47.711 --> 03:13:48.191]  Well, that's it.
[03:13:48.211 --> 03:13:55.493]  The angle to go here is this is corporate gold digging, geeking out, and it's just over the top.
[03:13:56.113 --> 03:13:58.974]  And it's part of this full-on assault that's going on.
[03:13:59.434 --> 03:14:02.075]  And as our guest said, Hayden Hewitt, a co-founder of LoudLeak.com,
[03:14:04.059 --> 03:14:09.403]  This is really a distraction from the TPP and a tax on free speech.
[03:14:09.503 --> 03:14:10.683]  Thank you so much, CJ.
[03:14:10.723 --> 03:14:11.184]  Great points.
[03:14:11.204 --> 03:14:12.925]  All right, Hayden Hewitt, you're very polite.
[03:14:12.945 --> 03:14:15.347]  You keep pausing every 30 seconds to have me jump in, which I'll do.
[03:14:15.667 --> 03:14:17.708]  The last six, seven minutes we have, you have the floor.
[03:14:18.128 --> 03:14:19.529]  Rant about whatever you want.
[03:14:19.870 --> 03:14:21.230]  Tell us about shows you're involved.
[03:14:21.250 --> 03:14:22.711]  Tell us about LiveLeak.com.
[03:14:23.172 --> 03:14:26.654]  Tell us about how you secretly want to have a change into an Easter Bunny.
[03:14:26.814 --> 03:14:29.516]  I want to be changed into the cow that jumped over the moon.
[03:14:29.836 --> 03:14:30.557]  I'm courageous.
[03:14:30.617 --> 03:14:32.538]  Pay for my change into a cow.
[03:14:33.279 --> 03:14:33.559]  Go ahead.
[03:14:34.159 --> 03:14:40.561]  I was going to say this is all well and good, but seeing as I've just heard the figures involved, I've just got someone over there ordering me a dress on eBay right now.
[03:14:41.481 --> 03:14:45.082]  Because that's the money that goes around just for, you know, a gender reassignment.
[03:14:45.142 --> 03:14:49.144]  I might not go the full thing, but I'm sure, you know, for a few hundred thousand dollars... Exactly!
[03:14:49.184 --> 03:14:54.605]  I'm not going to chop my Johnson off, but I could start wearing a dress for a $100,000-to-speak engagement.
[03:14:54.925 --> 03:14:56.606]  I could have a new persona.
[03:14:57.966 --> 03:14:58.807]  Chelsea Manning.
[03:15:00.427 --> 03:15:01.927]  I would pay money to see you in a dress.
[03:15:02.267 --> 03:15:04.008]  Not in a kinky way, dude.
[03:15:04.028 --> 03:15:04.588]  No, I get it.
[03:15:04.608 --> 03:15:05.268]  I may actually do it.
[03:15:05.288 --> 03:15:06.208]  I'm thinking about it.
[03:15:06.709 --> 03:15:07.229]  Oh, please.
[03:15:07.629 --> 03:15:09.249]  That's a joke.
[03:15:09.469 --> 03:15:11.970]  No, I thought about it as a gag, doing it, but I'm not going to do it.
[03:15:12.870 --> 03:15:14.911]  Hillary chopped hers off and look how much she gets us.
[03:15:15.071 --> 03:15:16.011]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[03:15:16.051 --> 03:15:17.831]  Yeah, it's... I'm sorry, go ahead, sir.
[03:15:17.851 --> 03:15:19.552]  Well, you were telling us you lost all this weight.
[03:15:19.692 --> 03:15:22.633]  Think about the dress sizes you can squeeze into now, dude.
[03:15:23.553 --> 03:15:23.913]  Exactly.
[03:15:25.229 --> 03:15:28.092]  See, you're not thinking it through, you've got to think it all the way through.
[03:15:28.112 --> 03:15:39.524]  Okay, other stuff, well obviously there's LiveLeague.com, which started out in 2006 at 6 o'clock in the morning, and that's when my whole life went crazy.
[03:15:39.544 --> 03:15:43.408]  It's been an amazing rollercoaster, it's 100% independent.
[03:15:46.162 --> 03:15:48.924]  Um, it shouldn't work.
[03:15:49.284 --> 03:15:50.805]  It shouldn't work, but it does.
[03:15:51.465 --> 03:15:57.829]  It does have rules, but none of those rules are based on opinions or beliefs or anything like that.
[03:15:58.309 --> 03:16:00.350]  In that respect, it's as free as it can be.
[03:16:00.990 --> 03:16:10.256]  We do have some rules on language, because as you know, running a site yourself, if you allow certain things, you end up being a site that's just smothered in porn advertising and hate and nothing else.
[03:16:11.394 --> 03:16:15.056]  But Live League's something I've just been honoured to be involved with for so long.
[03:16:15.796 --> 03:16:18.958]  As to other things that we do, we do the Live League Show once a week.
[03:16:18.978 --> 03:16:23.181]  We're doing it this evening at 10.30pm British Summer Time.
[03:16:24.481 --> 03:16:25.962]  We do talk about some serious stuff.
[03:16:25.982 --> 03:16:28.103]  We will be talking about Bruce Jenner and some other things.
[03:16:28.283 --> 03:16:29.444]  Tell folks the name of the show!
[03:16:30.404 --> 03:16:33.406]  It's the Live League Show, but it's definitely for 18 years and over.
[03:16:33.526 --> 03:16:37.989]  It is absolutely full to the brim of the most disgusting language
[03:16:39.660 --> 03:16:42.682]  Foul opinions, abuse, trolling from the members.
[03:16:43.243 --> 03:16:46.126]  We show some grotesque videos sometimes as well.
[03:16:46.226 --> 03:16:48.808]  So it's just a no-holds-bar-free-for-all?
[03:16:49.509 --> 03:16:52.392]  Yeah, it's just disgusting.
[03:16:53.513 --> 03:16:55.294]  I am ashamed of myself.
[03:16:55.815 --> 03:16:56.616]  I understand.
[03:16:57.597 --> 03:16:58.978]  But it's a good shame.
[03:17:03.547 --> 03:17:17.396]  Got the media company that's slowly but surely getting moving where we're combining doing corporate media and creative media and supporting people who are passionate about their topic and want to get it out there and just I honestly believe
[03:17:18.718 --> 03:17:27.345]  If more people who are capable, and there are lots of us around the world, nothing special, genuinely, that's not fake pride or anything like that, it's true.
[03:17:28.226 --> 03:17:41.096]  If everyone that had these resources devoted just a little bit of their time, a little bit of their energy, be it the filming side, the uploading side, the graphics side, imagine what a group of thousands could do.
[03:17:42.925 --> 03:17:43.526]  Pretty much.
[03:17:43.666 --> 03:17:45.086]  No investment on a personal basis.
[03:17:45.146 --> 03:17:46.427]  I'm not trying to sell anything here.
[03:17:46.767 --> 03:17:48.688]  And by the way, you mean outside the cookie cutter.
[03:17:48.708 --> 03:17:49.848]  It doesn't even mean we all agree.
[03:17:49.908 --> 03:17:52.910]  It's that we're not doing the five company brainwash dance.
[03:17:53.170 --> 03:17:55.531]  We're doing true organic human activity.
[03:17:56.291 --> 03:18:05.915]  Could you imagine if the big movies and shakes and alternative news put their heads together on a project and invited 10,000 citizen journalists to do the same?
[03:18:05.956 --> 03:18:06.536]  I want to do that.
[03:18:07.338 --> 03:18:09.139]  What corporate media could stand up to that?
[03:18:09.799 --> 03:18:13.901]  In truth, totally decentralised, totally untouched.
[03:18:13.921 --> 03:18:20.783]  So this is something in my own very small, and it is a very small way, but it's something I'm striving towards being a part of.
[03:18:21.244 --> 03:18:29.327]  If I can only influence two other people to try it, well they can go and influence two people each to try it, and we'll actually have a cool pyramid scheme.
[03:18:29.787 --> 03:18:34.990]  Sure, well your site's reached billions, you know, just on YouTube we've reached billions, and then other platforms.
[03:18:35.010 --> 03:18:39.933]  I mean, look, I'm nothing that special at the end of the day, except that I have the will to take action.
[03:18:40.273 --> 03:18:42.214]  I've had a huge effect, and I get what you're saying.
[03:18:42.574 --> 03:18:43.915]  You've seen the effect you've had.
[03:18:44.315 --> 03:18:48.938]  There's the thrill of seeing other fellow humans do amazing, trailblazing things, innovation.
[03:18:49.158 --> 03:18:54.441]  You're saying, folks, get off the bench, successful people especially, get involved in the culture war.
[03:18:55.731 --> 03:19:07.762]  Yeah, I mean, one of the things that I'm sure, Richie, when we're talking, because it's an open business model that we've started, what we do to protect everyone is my company and the people we work with form a new company where everyone's partners.
[03:19:09.243 --> 03:19:14.108]  So as they push it and strive and push that vehicle, that media vehicle forward, and it does earn some money,
[03:19:15.199 --> 03:19:16.240]  They get the chunk of it.
[03:19:16.801 --> 03:19:29.018]  And it's this openness and fairness that we could do without the corporate sort of horrible, slimy, screw everyone atmosphere, you know, screw the little man and screw the talent.
[03:19:29.038 --> 03:19:30.180]  The predatory B.S.
[03:19:31.121 --> 03:19:32.583]  It doesn't have to be that way.
[03:19:32.803 --> 03:19:34.365]  I know it sounds kind of hippie.
[03:19:46.098 --> 03:19:47.238]  Everybody like I want to be treated.
[03:19:47.278 --> 03:19:50.239]  It's the golden rule and that's what made civilization.
[03:19:50.519 --> 03:19:53.220]  This predatory globalist model is going out.
[03:19:53.280 --> 03:19:55.281]  I mean right as it crests, it's coming to its end.
[03:19:55.681 --> 03:19:57.481]  Hayden Hewitt, LiveLeak.com.
[03:19:57.761 --> 03:19:58.722]  Thank you so much for the time.
[03:19:58.902 --> 03:20:06.904]  I look forward to having you back on soon and I hope we can get on the phone sometime and talk about working together and I appreciate your support with our channels on LiveLeak, sir.
[03:20:07.918 --> 03:20:08.318]  No, I promise.
[03:20:08.359 --> 03:20:10.020]  It's been my pleasure and I'll speak to you soon.
[03:20:10.120 --> 03:20:10.561]  Great job.
[03:20:10.861 --> 03:20:13.424]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[03:20:13.564 --> 03:20:17.568]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[03:20:17.888 --> 03:20:19.109]  Silverlungs.com.
[03:20:19.269 --> 03:20:21.752]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[03:20:21.952 --> 03:20:24.735]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[03:20:24.935 --> 03:20:27.057]  The Silver Lungs Generator allows you to make your own.
[03:20:27.278 --> 03:20:29.040]  So stop paying for Silver Solutions.
[03:20:29.200 --> 03:20:34.525]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other Silver Solutions simply cannot reach.
[03:20:34.766 --> 03:20:38.430]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.
[03:20:38.570 --> 03:20:40.071]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[03:20:40.832 --> 03:20:45.256]  So Mark and I were talking about these looters, you know, in Baltimore and in Ferguson.
[03:20:45.296 --> 03:20:48.760]  Seems like every time there's some kind of an upset, the looters come out.
[03:20:48.800 --> 03:21:02.552]  And I'm thinking to myself, you know, I'm a small business guy, Mark's a small business guy, and we go to Guns80.com and we get our AR-15 kits and we get our 30 shot magazines and we're ready for the looters if you get my drift.
[03:21:02.852 --> 03:21:03.113]  Hello.
[03:21:03.573 --> 03:21:09.471]  Don't wait for the Power 700-274-3070 to claim yours while supplies last.
[03:21:09.812 --> 03:21:10.374]  Don't wait.
