[00:00:19.963 --> 00:00:21.887]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.948 --> 00:00:25.937]  It is Friday, September 25th, 2015 and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.137 --> 00:00:27.480]  Here is a look at what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:54.742]  Tonight, the Obama White House has directed an FBI task force to put Alex Jones and the Infowars operation under surveillance in anticipation of a potential raid, as the Obama regime's persecution of journalists has led many to characterize his administration as the most hostile towards the free press in modern history.
[00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:58.883]  Meanwhile, Facebook censors one of our Infowars posts.
[00:00:59.543 --> 00:00:59.903]  Again.
[00:01:00.144 --> 00:01:07.590]  Plus, Speaker John Boehner, under pressure from conservatives in his own party, announced his resignation today.
[00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.551]  Put it back on screen.
[00:01:10.472 --> 00:01:14.375]  I certainly don't want the institution to go through this.
[00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:15.616]  He's got the tissue out.
[00:01:15.957 --> 00:01:20.760]  All that plus much more, up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:58.996 --> 00:02:00.137]  Knockout is back.
[00:02:00.478 --> 00:02:11.591]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:02:11.992 --> 00:02:13.694]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:02:14.174 --> 00:02:15.296]  You take one or two of these.
[00:02:16.517 --> 00:02:19.800]  And it just is really clean, restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:21.222]  It's what I've experienced.
[00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:23.964]  And it just synergistically puts everything in there.
[00:02:23.984 --> 00:02:25.526]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:02:25.686 --> 00:02:27.067]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:27.648]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[00:02:33.232 --> 00:02:37.293]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[00:02:38.473 --> 00:02:42.595]  And they are indeed losing the information war thanks to the internet.
[00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:53.239]  Now we have seen a crackdown on all sorts of sites reporting truthful news on everything from GMOs to exposing the fact that dead photos of children are used to push an agenda.
[00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.240]  Well now, Obama's war on the free press escalates.
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:11.687]  Now, a source has told Alex Jones yesterday that the Obama White House has directed an FBI task force to put Alex Jones and the Infowars operation under surveillance in anticipation of a potential raid.
[00:03:12.188 --> 00:03:15.950]  Now, Jones was first contacted about a year ago by a source within the FBI
[00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.353]  Who informed him that InfoWars was being kept under close surveillance by the federal government.
[00:03:21.793 --> 00:03:35.361]  Well now, a different source is saying that meetings have already taken place where FBI agents have openly expressed their confidence that they will find something with which to go after Alex Jones, even if it means framing him.
[00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:54.164]  Now, in light of the Lois Lerner scandal, where conservative groups were deliberately targeted by the IRS, the feds are keen to not make this process look like a political persecution, so they're likely to have it spearheaded by the Federal Trade Commission and be related to the InfoWars sale of health supplements
[00:03:54.645 --> 00:03:57.166]  This is according to Alex Jones.
[00:03:57.606 --> 00:04:03.228]  Now coming up, Alex Jones is going to be breaking this story down in its entirety, but this type of thing happens a lot.
[00:04:03.808 --> 00:04:05.609]  We've seen it happen with Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:17.374]  Back in 2007, the Dallas Mavericks' Mark Cuban was also threatened by the SEC for his involvement in a controversial political documentary that would have been embarrassing for the White House.
[00:04:17.754 --> 00:04:20.755]  So these agencies are used as government goons
[00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:25.639]  To push this agenda and let's face it, Obama is sick and tired of info wars.
[00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:33.805]  We've been exposing his false flags left and right and we have seen his dogs coming after us like Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:04:34.126 --> 00:04:45.875]  Now you'll recall that Zuckerberg was taking these big time meetings at the White House after it was determined that Facebook would be controlling the internet and aggregating the news that you are able to read.
[00:04:46.355 --> 00:04:46.796]  We've seen
[00:04:47.276 --> 00:04:47.616]  I think so.
[00:05:05.703 --> 00:05:09.025]  Amnesty, because he wants to bring in all these low-paid workers.
[00:05:09.545 --> 00:05:22.171]  So, as the story went, little Sophie Cruz slipped past security to approach the Popemobile to not only give the Pope a t-shirt, but to deliver him a handwritten letter which advocates amnesty for illegals.
[00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:29.395]  Now, the t-shirt that Cruz gave him read, Pope, rescue DAPA so the legalization would be your blessing.
[00:05:29.835 --> 00:05:35.136]  So it was just this heartwarming story, and of course, that's exactly the way that the mainstream media spun this.
[00:05:35.637 --> 00:05:38.197]  Oh, this cute little girl, how did she get past security?
[00:05:38.377 --> 00:05:41.398]  Oh, and she just so happened to have a present to give the Pope.
[00:05:41.818 --> 00:05:45.839]  Well, turns out that it was a PR stunt.
[00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:51.941]  Once again, we called it before it had a chance to get out there, and this is the kind of thing that the President does not like.
[00:05:51.981 --> 00:05:56.262]  He doesn't like it when we call him out on his little PR stunts to push his agenda.
[00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:57.683]  Now, this is coming out of the AP.
[00:05:58.803 --> 00:06:02.545]  Immigration group planned girl's Pope encounter for a year.
[00:06:02.565 --> 00:06:13.770]  Now the AP is reporting that Sophie Cruz's encounter with the Pope during a parade this week looked to be one of those spontaneous, once-in-a-lifetime moments Frances has become known for.
[00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.853]  That's according to, you know, anyone who is not half awake.
[00:06:18.953 --> 00:06:20.233]  It's just spontaneous.
[00:06:20.293 --> 00:06:21.154]  We called it right away.
[00:06:21.934 --> 00:06:22.454]  But they go on.
[00:06:22.795 --> 00:06:36.923]  For five-year-old Sophie, the chance to wrap her arm around the Pope's neck as he offered a hug, kiss, and a blessing unfolded as perfectly as it was scripted by members of a coalition of Los Angeles-based immigration rights groups.
[00:06:37.283 --> 00:06:47.109]  They had been planning this for nearly a year, prepping the young girl to make a dash for the Popemobile to deliver a message about the plight of immigrant parents living in the country illegally.
[00:06:47.549 --> 00:06:56.475]  So now you know how the media was able to find out about this little girl so quickly and roll her out and have her read her letter, you know, hear it in her own words.
[00:06:56.875 --> 00:07:00.397]  So again, it's all about using the right imagery to push the agenda.
[00:07:00.537 --> 00:07:07.862]  And if you're someone who doesn't use the right imagery to push the agenda and you actually try to counter it with some truth news and not propaganda,
[00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:10.524]  They're going to come after you and try to shut you down.
[00:07:11.004 --> 00:07:20.273]  Now, if you don't think that government agencies are capable of being this big and bad, well, again, I point you to Lois Lerner targeting conservative groups.
[00:07:20.593 --> 00:07:22.695]  But here's a story coming out of Seattle.
[00:07:23.215 --> 00:07:31.022]  Seattle IRS agent is facing federal charges after soliciting a bribe from a marijuana dispensary owner.
[00:07:31.443 --> 00:07:32.003]  So there you go.
[00:07:32.824 --> 00:07:35.006]  You know, Lois Lerner, like we say, it trickles down.
[00:07:35.467 --> 00:07:44.958]  Now this incident began when IRS agent Paul G. Hurley was tasked with performing an audit on the dispensary and he approached the shop owner and demanded $20,000 in exchange for leniency.
[00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:56.625]  After the encounter, the business owner immediately contacted federal authorities, who later oversaw multiple meetings and exchanges of cash between the pair.
[00:07:57.085 --> 00:08:04.908]  During one of the final meetings, Hurley reportedly told this pot shop owner off the record that he'd saved him more than a million dollars.
[00:08:05.488 --> 00:08:09.530]  Despite no tax deductions existing for marijuana dispensaries.
[00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.891]  So he was doing him a favor.
[00:08:10.911 --> 00:08:12.652]  Not going to have to pay all these taxes.
[00:08:13.072 --> 00:08:14.853]  Just slip me a little something under the table.
[00:08:15.173 --> 00:08:21.176]  Now do you think this is the only time something like this has happened and the only agency where we're seeing this type of activity occur?
[00:08:21.656 --> 00:08:33.842]  So it's a good thing that this industry has become legalized in certain areas because now this dispensary owner could actually go and get some help rather than just being blackmailed and having to, you know, pay off somebody.
[00:08:34.702 --> 00:08:42.935]  And of course we've heard of these things happening in other agencies with crooked cops and other agents of power if you will.
[00:08:44.117 --> 00:08:49.345]  But also let's point out with this whole crackdown it's really easy to be
[00:08:50.206 --> 00:08:50.726]  We're good to go.
[00:09:09.454 --> 00:09:10.434]  To be labeled this way.
[00:09:10.655 --> 00:09:15.096]  That's why it's incredibly frightening when you see stories like this one that are coming out of the New York Times.
[00:09:15.657 --> 00:09:20.699]  Police program aims to pinpoint those most likely to commit crimes.
[00:09:20.779 --> 00:09:25.581]  Now we've been telling you this for a long time, for years, this predictive policing.
[00:09:26.541 --> 00:09:30.383]  This strategy combines elements of traditional policing, like
[00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:31.043]  I think so.
[00:09:48.969 --> 00:10:02.873]  And we've talked a lot about how here in Austin, Texas, one of the main software creators of something like this that aggregates all of your social media use is now being used by the police here to track people's activity via their social media accounts.
[00:10:03.313 --> 00:10:06.174]  So this is going on in many, many agencies.
[00:10:07.194 --> 00:10:17.183]  And it's a part of a larger trend by the government and corporations that are increasingly turning to predictive analysis and data mining to look at behaviors.
[00:10:17.803 --> 00:10:21.046]  And it's also typically financed by the federal government.
[00:10:21.386 --> 00:10:30.514]  So it's all about control and protecting the surveillance state, protecting the establishment and the order that has been set up.
[00:10:30.574 --> 00:10:32.816]  They don't want anyone changing the system.
[00:10:33.396 --> 00:10:37.558]  And that's why, you know, you're not going to see someone like a Ron Paul get elected to become the president.
[00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:43.162]  So, you know, is this going to improve conditions between citizens and the police?
[00:10:43.762 --> 00:10:47.384]  It seems like it's going to further justify racial profiling, something like this.
[00:10:47.444 --> 00:10:49.966]  Or also, what about guilt by association?
[00:10:50.106 --> 00:10:53.007]  Because you just so happen to be friends with someone on a social network.
[00:10:53.428 --> 00:10:57.050]  Or maybe they are trying to contact you and maybe you're not even speaking with them.
[00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:01.692]  But this has all sorts of problems here with this predictive policing.
[00:11:02.213 --> 00:11:02.353]  Now,
[00:11:03.888 --> 00:11:12.692]  Researchers who are working with police to create these algorithms say that they're coming closer than traditional detectives in being able to predict who's apt to break the law.
[00:11:13.113 --> 00:11:24.598]  So this includes previous arrests, unemployment, an unstable home life, friends or relatives who have been killed or who are in prison or gangs, and people who have problems with drugs or alcohol.
[00:11:25.058 --> 00:11:32.202]  And I'm sorry, but I can think of a lot of people who have those certain situations in their life, you know, by no
[00:11:32.722 --> 00:11:33.525]  Fault of their own.
[00:11:33.545 --> 00:11:36.253]  This is just something that occurs in a lot of people's lives.
[00:11:36.294 --> 00:11:36.875]  So there you go!
[00:11:38.092 --> 00:11:42.295]  Now, also, if you're an Alex Jones listener, there you go.
[00:11:42.375 --> 00:11:50.480]  It's not just Alex Jones that they're wanting to take down, but they're definitely surveilling those who listen to internet, radio, and talk radio.
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:57.324]  Now this is Steve Watson reporting about a spy program out of the UK that is much bigger than anything the NSA has done.
[00:11:58.144 --> 00:12:03.328]  British government spied on everyone's web activity and targeted internet radio listeners.
[00:12:03.888 --> 00:12:06.369]  This has been going on for the past seven years.
[00:12:06.789 --> 00:12:19.115]  Spies with the GCHQ, which is the British equivalent of the NSA, have been spying on every visible user's internet activity and called the operation Karma Police because they're radio head fans.
[00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:25.058]  Now, this new revelation comes from the documents provided to The Intercept by Edward Snowden.
[00:12:26.343 --> 00:12:32.446]  And GCHQ has referred to this program as the world's biggest internet data mining operation.
[00:12:32.986 --> 00:12:49.713]  The document notes that some of the websites specifically targeted for covert cookie collection included Facebook, Microsoft Live, Amazon, YouTube, Reddit, WordPress, Yahoo, Google, YouPorn, and news sites such as Reuters, CNN, and the BBC.
[00:12:49.813 --> 00:12:54.095]  So I can think of, I mean, I pretty much visit those websites every single day.
[00:12:54.615 --> 00:12:55.396]  Except for YouPorn.
[00:12:56.036 --> 00:13:03.441]  Now the genesis of the program appears to have been an operation to track individuals listening to internet radio.
[00:13:03.921 --> 00:13:10.325]  And of course here they say that the spies were researching into how radicals could be misusing the internet radio to spread their messages.
[00:13:10.686 --> 00:13:18.411]  The Intercept reports that it was mainly looking at radio stations that were broadcasting any spoken recitations from the Quran.
[00:13:19.311 --> 00:13:24.673]  But then they point out how other metadata was being sweeped up that had nothing to do with that.
[00:13:25.053 --> 00:13:34.998]  But no doubt, the same thing is happening with any of this so-called domestic terrorists that are listening to talk radio as well.
[00:13:35.418 --> 00:13:43.141]  So, I don't know about you guys, but I think it's time to dismantle Obama's, our global government surveillance state.
[00:13:43.976 --> 00:13:55.420]  President Obama's reign is winding down as a season of potential candidates pounces on the gigantic unconstitutional eyesore Obama will leave in his wake.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.641]  Dismantling Obama's Bilderberg agenda handiwork, i.e.
[00:13:59.721 --> 00:14:06.883]  his legacy, could potentially take the next leader of the supposed free world their entire term to tear down.
[00:14:07.343 --> 00:14:08.043]  Obamacare.
[00:14:08.484 --> 00:14:09.164]  If you have
[00:14:09.944 --> 00:14:14.648]  Or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law.
[00:14:15.589 --> 00:14:16.790]  And you really liked that plan.
[00:14:18.111 --> 00:14:20.073]  What we said was, you could keep it.
[00:14:22.043 --> 00:14:24.585]  If it hasn't changed since the laws passed.
[00:14:24.965 --> 00:14:40.737]  The Middle Class and Sovereign Killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, the American Citizen Targeting NDAA, and the Global ISIS Funding Infrastructure, to name just a few of the parapets propping up the structure of the established New World Order.
[00:14:41.037 --> 00:14:45.521]  Thanks in large part to President Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:54.630]  If anyone's still listening in Washington DC, I would advise the next president, if we actually get one, rather than another puppet, start small.
[00:14:55.010 --> 00:15:07.424]  Start with Obama's Orwellian discrimination database collection of American citizens aiming to target areas where socialist policies can thrive and lead America down the rabbit hole towards totalitarianism.
[00:15:07.904 --> 00:15:34.991]  The New York Post reported, This Orwellian-style stockpile of statistics includes a vast and permanent network of discrimination databases, which Obama already is using to make disparate impact cases against banks that don't make enough prime loans to minorities, schools that suspend too many blacks, cities that don't offer enough Section 8 and other low-income housing for minorities, and employers who turn down African-Americans for jobs due to criminal backgrounds.
[00:15:35.171 --> 00:15:53.697]  Big Brother Brock wants the databases operational before he leaves office, and much of the data in them will be posted online, so that civil rights attorneys and urban activist groups will be able to exploit them to show patterns of racial disparities and segregation, even if no other evidence of discrimination exists.
[00:15:54.118 --> 00:15:55.278]  Appreciate it, Congress.
[00:15:55.618 --> 00:15:58.779]  Your protection of our Bill of Rights is a laughing stock.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:12.225]  We are spied on, taxed to death, lied to, and now the Commandeer-in-Chief has spearheaded an Orwellian database to divide us all based on race in the name of racial and economic justice.
[00:16:12.505 --> 00:16:14.886]  Why are some countries different culturally than others?
[00:16:14.926 --> 00:16:19.068]  Why do some countries not have resources but are more successful than countries that do have resources?
[00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:23.490]  And it goes to the cultural experiences of that people of that nation.
[00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:27.052]  And now we're being absolutely subdivided and destroyed.
[00:16:27.072 --> 00:16:33.836]  And it doesn't matter if globalist forces are conquering your country, as long as you can racially divide and conquer the public.
[00:16:34.281 --> 00:16:39.867]  Well, I suppose if you really want to divide and conquer a nation, technology can be a powerful tool.
[00:16:40.127 --> 00:16:45.452]  But it's pointless to utilize it in this great capitalistic melting pot we call America.
[00:16:45.733 --> 00:16:57.345]  You see, Obama, if you really understood our nation and its people, you would be well aware that ideas and opinions aren't as skin deep as you would hope and change.
[00:16:58.098 --> 00:16:58.998]  It's not free speech, man.
[00:16:59.058 --> 00:17:01.479]  Nobody's stopping you from free speech.
[00:17:01.499 --> 00:17:03.120]  But you can't solicit out here.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.061]  Basically, you're soliciting your opinions.
[00:17:05.341 --> 00:17:06.141]  Is it a commodity?
[00:17:07.282 --> 00:17:10.123]  Is speech a commodity?
[00:17:10.283 --> 00:17:13.764]  So, what's the permit for that we need exactly?
[00:17:13.904 --> 00:17:15.305]  Why don't you go talk to Student Life?
[00:17:15.685 --> 00:17:16.786]  But you can't do it out here.
[00:17:16.966 --> 00:17:18.046]  Otherwise, they're going to black you out.
[00:17:18.106 --> 00:17:20.367]  John Baum for Infowars.com.
[00:17:21.187 --> 00:17:21.968]  Paul, guess what?
[00:17:22.488 --> 00:17:24.729]  We bugged Mr. Blake Stahl and we heard him talking to his lawyer.
[00:17:25.009 --> 00:17:27.550]  You see, we took the mic and we hit it up in the Stahl window.
[00:17:28.496 --> 00:17:29.497]  What are you talking about?
[00:17:29.637 --> 00:17:31.038]  We bugged Mr. Blake's cell.
[00:17:31.979 --> 00:17:32.579]  You what?
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.841]  We bugged the cell with Arnold's tape recorder.
[00:17:35.021 --> 00:17:35.982]  Just listen to this, Paul.
[00:17:36.062 --> 00:17:36.943]  I can't listen to that.
[00:17:37.103 --> 00:17:38.984]  But Paul... Opie, I can't listen to that.
[00:17:39.104 --> 00:17:39.985]  I'm not permitted.
[00:17:40.465 --> 00:17:41.726]  But Paul, you don't understand.
[00:17:41.746 --> 00:17:43.868]  Opie, I can't listen to this.
[00:17:44.829 --> 00:17:46.770]  Now, I told you about eavesdropping.
[00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:48.172]  But Paul, this is different.
[00:17:48.492 --> 00:17:49.453]  Yes, it's worse.
[00:17:50.173 --> 00:17:53.095]  You overheard a conversation that was supposed to be private.
[00:17:53.496 --> 00:17:55.277]  Now, I can't be a party to that.
[00:17:55.677 --> 00:17:57.399]  But Paul, if you just listen to this... Opie...
[00:17:58.115 --> 00:17:58.715]  I can't listen.
[00:17:59.135 --> 00:18:00.336]  Paul, you're erasing the tape!
[00:18:00.396 --> 00:18:02.157]  That's what I mean to do.
[00:18:03.617 --> 00:18:06.878]  You bugged a conversation between a lawyer and his client.
[00:18:07.859 --> 00:18:11.580]  Now that's violating one of the most sacred rights of privacy.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:19.263]  I might as well just...
[00:18:29.895 --> 00:18:30.075]  Oh my God.
[00:19:02.898 --> 00:19:05.639]  Are you ready to show your disapproval for Hillary Clinton?

[00:20:07.074 --> 00:20:10.297]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[00:20:10.538 --> 00:20:14.703]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
[00:20:16.952 --> 00:20:25.960]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:34.268]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:20:34.448 --> 00:20:39.112]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:20:39.312 --> 00:20:46.033]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:46.093 --> 00:20:53.174]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:20:53.254 --> 00:21:00.136]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:21:00.296 --> 00:21:04.636]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:21:04.776 --> 00:21:07.997]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:21:08.157 --> 00:21:14.299]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great-tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:21:14.459 --> 00:21:16.660]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.281]  Another major health threat.
[00:21:18.321 --> 00:21:23.222]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:25.923]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:21:25.963 --> 00:21:32.726]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:21:33.006 --> 00:21:35.827]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:21:36.007 --> 00:21:38.909]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:21:38.929 --> 00:21:40.950]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.892]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:21:43.912 --> 00:21:49.416]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:21:49.616 --> 00:21:53.118]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:21:53.138 --> 00:21:56.140]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:03.305]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:22:05.967 --> 00:22:08.270]  A few years ago, the Pentagon issued a report
[00:22:23.513 --> 00:22:28.256]  containing research dealing with controlling domestic populations here in the United States.
[00:22:29.137 --> 00:22:30.658]  And they weren't worried about communists.
[00:22:30.698 --> 00:22:32.859]  They weren't worried about radical Islamists.
[00:22:32.899 --> 00:22:36.782]  They weren't worried about conservatives or liberals or even peace activists.
[00:22:37.743 --> 00:22:48.510]  They were concerned about what they called empowered individuals who were taking action peacefully in the society to change the status quo.
[00:22:49.731 --> 00:22:50.752]  What is the status quo?
[00:22:52.059 --> 00:23:01.766]  The status quo is a rapid consolidation of wealth by the elite through crony capitalism and the public being domesticated via systems of socialism.
[00:23:03.827 --> 00:23:05.829]  The status quo is the breakdown of the family.
[00:23:05.889 --> 00:23:07.810]  The status quo is the end of our borders.
[00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:18.918]  The status quo is our government funding radical jihadists all over the Middle East and Africa and Central Asia to destabilize Christian areas and to kill other minority groups.
[00:23:21.331 --> 00:23:35.780]  Now, it was about a year ago that a FBI source, an FBI individual, contacted me to let me know that everything I was doing was being monitored and surveilled.
[00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:37.581]  And it was a very credible individual.
[00:23:39.203 --> 00:23:44.386]  And then today, I got contacted by an extremely credible individual.
[00:23:45.547 --> 00:23:47.328]  Many people out there would know their name.
[00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:57.234]  That the Obama administration has had enough of info wars and is worried about the fact that we are empowering people.
[00:23:57.874 --> 00:23:59.535]  That we are empowered individuals.
[00:24:00.335 --> 00:24:01.616]  And that we are bringing people together.
[00:24:03.416 --> 00:24:07.618]  And that they've got the entire operation lined up and ready.
[00:24:08.905 --> 00:24:15.547]  To pull a search and seizure, news cameras, whole nine yards raid on InfoWars.
[00:24:16.048 --> 00:24:25.191]  Now the whole point of that is like the cases with the Amish where they sell their neighbor cheese and then the feds SWAT team and put their head on the ground and they've got helicopters.
[00:24:25.791 --> 00:24:28.752]  It's to create the perception that you must really be a bad guy.
[00:24:29.672 --> 00:24:31.073]  But people see through that now.
[00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:32.591]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:24:33.212 --> 00:24:36.034]  They believe we have the full faith and credit of the U.S.
[00:24:36.074 --> 00:24:38.676]  federal government, so we can do whatever we want.
[00:24:38.696 --> 00:24:40.397]  We can commit any crime we want.
[00:24:40.637 --> 00:24:41.478]  We can get away with it.
[00:24:41.678 --> 00:24:49.884]  We can have Planned Parenthood openly sell baby parts, and we can see babies fighting scalpels with their hands, alive, out of the womb, and it's okay.
[00:24:50.124 --> 00:24:51.285]  Nobody's gonna get in trouble.
[00:24:52.446 --> 00:24:53.567]  And that's what this comes down to.
[00:24:53.727 --> 00:24:54.747]  I feel empowered.
[00:24:55.308 --> 00:24:56.289]  I feel strong.
[00:24:57.029 --> 00:25:00.992]  And I feel absolutely committed to telling the truth and exposing what's happening.
[00:25:02.392 --> 00:25:15.517]  But reportedly they have a FBI task force, one directly under the head of the FBI in D.C., the major white collar crime task force that goes after LaCosa Nostra, you name it.
[00:25:15.537 --> 00:25:18.458]  They don't go after the Federal Reserve that actually runs the drugs or launders the money.
[00:25:19.199 --> 00:25:20.159]  Goldman Sachs, J.P.
[00:25:20.179 --> 00:25:21.019]  Morgan, of course not.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.180]  Or Wells Fargo.
[00:25:23.757 --> 00:25:31.780]  And they've got them in their whole rooms of men and women just pouring over everything and their fake informants and all the rest of it to try to manufacture something.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:32.780]  And that's the word.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.802]  They're very confident that they can raid this facility and make something up.
[00:25:37.862 --> 00:25:38.722]  So go ahead.
[00:25:39.803 --> 00:25:41.523]  You've already committed to who you are.
[00:25:41.543 --> 00:25:44.004]  You've already committed to what you stand for.
[00:25:44.924 --> 00:25:45.865]  I know what I stand for.
[00:25:46.045 --> 00:25:46.725]  I know what I've done.
[00:25:47.742 --> 00:25:50.845]  I mean, I'm nothing compared to the forebearers of this nation.
[00:25:51.125 --> 00:25:54.128]  But my ancestors were there and were involved in it all.
[00:25:54.368 --> 00:26:06.219]  And they were greater men than I. And so I'm here facing a bunch of discredited, evil people who have a bunch of cowards amongst their midst who are compartmentalized who are going along with this.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:11.604]  And so what I face is nothing compared to my ancestors.
[00:26:12.365 --> 00:26:13.446]  So I have no fear.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:19.901]  I only hope that I can try to measure at least partially up to what they did.
[00:26:22.142 --> 00:26:29.603]  Now, it was also said when I called a couple of my lawyers that are pretty high-powered and smart, they said, you know, this could be a way to further try to discredit you.
[00:26:29.623 --> 00:26:39.626]  You know, they write those articles where you said Jade Helm would be martial law, and it wasn't, but of course you didn't say that, and where the end of the world was coming in September, you didn't say that, but they say you said that.
[00:26:40.905 --> 00:26:52.430]  I'd be careful on this because it takes a lot to have an administration come after the press, and this is really a bold move if they do this.
[00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:54.410]  But they had to concede.
[00:26:54.731 --> 00:27:03.174]  We've seen a record reign of terror on mainline reporters, on whistleblowers, and so this is really part of the climate we're going into.
[00:27:03.714 --> 00:27:06.175]  I hope this is just people jerking my chain.
[00:27:06.695 --> 00:27:07.776]  I hope this is just
[00:27:08.982 --> 00:27:10.783]  Folks trying to get a reaction.
[00:27:11.403 --> 00:27:25.990]  Because regardless of whether this is real or not, real people in the FBI continue to contact me to say, this is coming, this is being done, be ready.
[00:27:26.451 --> 00:27:26.991]  Be ready!
[00:27:27.451 --> 00:27:30.072]  I have outside accounting firms that do all the accounting.
[00:27:30.112 --> 00:27:31.333]  I can't even balance my own checkbook.
[00:27:32.148 --> 00:27:32.929]  I'm not a math guy.
[00:27:33.229 --> 00:27:35.951]  I have two outside firms, one that does it, one that audits it.
[00:27:36.431 --> 00:27:37.632]  Everything's transparent.
[00:27:38.253 --> 00:27:40.194]  In fact, that's the other thing.
[00:27:40.214 --> 00:27:42.636]  You sit back and you think, what is it they're going to cook up?
[00:27:43.897 --> 00:27:47.079]  One of my lawyers says, it'll probably be supplements, but you've got outside lawyers.
[00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:50.342]  You use outside top facilities that produce it for you.
[00:27:50.922 --> 00:27:53.024]  You're a private labeler for your formulas.
[00:27:54.965 --> 00:27:57.547]  That's probably, oh, that's the other big kicker.
[00:27:58.168 --> 00:27:59.769]  It's the Federal Trade Commission.
[00:28:01.087 --> 00:28:06.830]  The FTC, and when I heard that, I remembered the fact that I was on the phone with Mark Cuban.
[00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:16.256]  I only talked to him a couple times, and he was going to put out a film that I'd produced exposing Saudi involvement in 9-11, which is now basically admitted in the 28 pages.
[00:28:16.896 --> 00:28:21.038]  And he called back a few days later to the Hollywood producer and said, I can't do this now.
[00:28:21.298 --> 00:28:24.420]  He was going to put it on 1,100 screens and put it in stores everywhere.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.082]  You know, the host of Shark Tank, owner of the Mavericks.
[00:28:28.226 --> 00:28:29.527]  He said, listen, I got a family.
[00:28:29.687 --> 00:28:30.908]  I'm not going to be involved in this.
[00:28:32.129 --> 00:28:33.230]  Wow, this is really deep.
[00:28:34.831 --> 00:28:39.875]  And he came out and apologized in the news for talking about putting out loose change.
[00:28:40.535 --> 00:28:51.904]  A year later, New York Times comes out with an email, not just a call, with the Fed saying, we're going to indict you for insider trading because you put this film out.
[00:28:52.865 --> 00:28:56.888]  I know you've written the federal laws where taking a crap in your own toilet's illegal.
[00:28:58.044 --> 00:29:03.765]  I know that you've got this whole thing set up with your fake grand juries and your federal juries and all the rest of it.
[00:29:04.345 --> 00:29:08.246]  Don't ever think that I got into this not knowing the stakes.
[00:29:09.186 --> 00:29:13.487]  Don't ever think I got into this not knowing criminals run this country now.
[00:29:14.527 --> 00:29:18.588]  I mean, hell, you people are in baby part business.
[00:29:18.848 --> 00:29:20.849]  You keep babies alive and sell their organs.
[00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:22.889]  You protect the people that do that.
[00:29:23.429 --> 00:29:27.390]  DynCorp and Halliburton that's come out are in the child trafficking rings.
[00:29:28.663 --> 00:29:30.203]  You people bring the narcotics in.
[00:29:30.243 --> 00:29:31.944]  I mean, you don't think I don't know that?
[00:29:33.044 --> 00:29:36.445]  I just always love how you try to intimidate me and you act like I don't know.
[00:29:36.705 --> 00:29:37.325]  I know!
[00:29:37.345 --> 00:29:42.166]  I have a moral responsibility to stand up to you.
[00:29:43.006 --> 00:29:44.307]  And I will continue to do it.
[00:29:46.947 --> 00:29:48.888]  And I may be destroyed in the process.
[00:29:48.928 --> 00:29:49.848]  That's part of God's plan.
[00:29:52.008 --> 00:29:59.736]  But in the final equation, my listeners and my viewers are the empowered people, and they're the power of Infowars.com.
[00:30:01.117 --> 00:30:04.361]  They're the power of liberty and freedom.
[00:30:05.202 --> 00:30:07.924]  I'm not the person that's important, and they're not going to go away.
[00:30:08.965 --> 00:30:14.992]  And they'll know in their hearts that whatever it is you're going to make up is a load of manure.
[00:30:16.004 --> 00:30:21.166]  This isn't the FBI and the CIA and the NSA of 30 years ago when you still had the public's trust.
[00:30:21.306 --> 00:30:22.386]  You don't have its trust.
[00:30:23.827 --> 00:30:27.688]  And you're just moving forward with America's inertia as if this can go on forever.
[00:30:28.568 --> 00:30:43.134]  The head of defense intelligence, the general, and the deputy head of the CIA have all gone public in the last two months saying our government ordered them to aid Al Qaeda and ISIS and that it's evil and they're fixing intelligence.
[00:30:43.274 --> 00:30:44.014]  Our military
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:45.320]  Yes.
[00:31:08.439 --> 00:31:15.684]  Listed with all the cowards over there that went along with being a bunch of parasites and gangs who feel so safe in their cowardice part of their little cruise.
[00:31:17.345 --> 00:31:18.366]  And that's what this comes down to.
[00:31:18.406 --> 00:31:22.569]  We are about human empowerment and I know it shook them up, the money bomb.
[00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:24.971]  I mean, you know how much money we have to bring in to run this?
[00:31:25.011 --> 00:31:25.511]  That's nothing.
[00:31:26.472 --> 00:31:29.254]  I know it shook the system up to know that we've got 1.4, 1.6
[00:31:32.486 --> 00:31:35.027]  Billion people reached every month via social media.
[00:31:35.347 --> 00:31:36.127]  I know it shakes you up.
[00:31:36.167 --> 00:31:38.027]  We have billions of views online every year.
[00:31:38.047 --> 00:31:39.408]  I know it shakes you up.
[00:31:39.468 --> 00:31:41.748]  We reach 3-4 million people through actual radio a day.
[00:31:42.088 --> 00:31:44.409]  We got a million podcast listeners a day.
[00:31:44.649 --> 00:31:45.509]  And it's all growing.
[00:31:45.649 --> 00:31:46.289]  Absolutely!
[00:31:46.649 --> 00:31:55.471]  But I know as we rise to face you, for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction, that you're going to do this.
[00:31:56.512 --> 00:31:58.052]  You are playing your role.
[00:31:59.093 --> 00:32:01.595]  You think you've chosen the right God, the right team.
[00:32:02.336 --> 00:32:05.179]  I've chosen the side I'm on and that's where I am forever.
[00:32:05.899 --> 00:32:16.609]  And it is a fulfilling feeling, a buoying feeling, to know that I'm on the side of right and to show people they can be empowered and stand up against the Goliaths of this world.
[00:32:27.702 --> 00:32:32.727]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:32:32.947 --> 00:32:39.072]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:32:39.273 --> 00:32:46.239]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:32:46.579 --> 00:32:56.508]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:32:57.088 --> 00:33:03.013]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:33:03.253 --> 00:33:05.936]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:33:06.656 --> 00:33:07.336]  Brain Force is here.
[00:33:07.376 --> 00:33:09.777]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:33:09.977 --> 00:33:12.037]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused.
[00:33:33.824 --> 00:33:38.824]  Less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:33:39.605 --> 00:33:43.188]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:33:43.208 --> 00:33:45.710]  You're going to crash afterwards, really bad afterwards.
[00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:49.592]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:33:49.652 --> 00:33:52.795]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:33:53.295 --> 00:33:58.079]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:33:58.639 --> 00:34:05.244]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it, that is activated by the different compounds in the yerba mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:34:05.444 --> 00:34:07.505]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:34:08.085 --> 00:34:09.585]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:34:09.705 --> 00:34:09.845]  Exactly.
[00:34:09.865 --> 00:34:13.786]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:34:13.946 --> 00:34:15.187]  Still damaging your brain.
[00:34:15.527 --> 00:34:23.549]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:34:28.752 --> 00:34:30.693]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:34:30.893 --> 00:34:36.896]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:34:37.076 --> 00:34:42.078]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[00:34:42.158 --> 00:34:46.901]  The new InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver is the answer for you and your family.
[00:34:47.041 --> 00:34:51.543]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[00:34:51.843 --> 00:35:00.228]  The InfoWarsLife Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[00:35:00.448 --> 00:35:02.409]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:13.695]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.
[00:35:13.775 --> 00:35:21.199]  For your preparedness storage or your home kitchen, purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today.
[00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:27.920]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.741]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:35:29.761 --> 00:35:31.141]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:35:31.421 --> 00:35:32.541]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:35:33.081 --> 00:35:37.862]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:37.962 --> 00:35:41.723]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:35:42.463 --> 00:35:43.923]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:35:43.963 --> 00:35:45.304]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:35:45.324 --> 00:35:47.444]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:24.688]  You are watching the InfoWars Nightly News which airs 7 p.m.
[00:36:24.728 --> 00:36:26.813]  Central at InfoWarsNews.com.
[00:36:30.638 --> 00:36:39.721]  Under intense pressure from conservatives in his own party, Speaker John Boehner has announced he will resign from one of the most powerful positions in government.
[00:36:40.081 --> 00:36:42.621]  He will give up his seat at the end of October.
[00:36:43.021 --> 00:36:51.564]  Now, Boehner blamed his decision on vacating on the House's hard-right members, who he says are unwilling to govern.
[00:36:52.044 --> 00:36:58.686]  Now, really, it's more like there are a lot of people who are sick and tired of a rhino helping push the president's agenda.
[00:36:59.406 --> 00:37:02.229]  Now, I'm talking like Ted Cruz.
[00:37:02.289 --> 00:37:04.831]  He says, these early reports are discouraging.
[00:37:05.271 --> 00:37:24.829]  If it's correct that the Speaker, before he resigns, has cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi to fund the Obama administration for the rest of the year, to fund Obamacare, to fund executive amnesty, to fund Planned Parenthood, to fund implementation of this Iran deal, and then presumably to land a cushy K Street job
[00:37:25.389 --> 00:37:34.832]  After joining with the Democrats to implement all of President Obama's priorities, that is not the behavior one would expect from a Republican Speaker of the House.
[00:37:35.612 --> 00:37:36.472]  Indeed.
[00:37:36.492 --> 00:37:39.313]  Well, I'm glad that someone is finally speaking up.
[00:37:39.353 --> 00:37:44.134]  You'll recall that last year they had another, oh, we're going to have to shut the government down.
[00:37:44.674 --> 00:37:57.041]  And they effectively handed over the entire budget for fiscal year 2015 to the Democrats' agenda, even though there was a Republican majority, even though the United States elected Republicans as a majority.
[00:37:57.081 --> 00:38:03.665]  They still handed it over, and then Boehner is once again trying to force this issue of pushing a leftist agenda.
[00:38:04.605 --> 00:38:17.993]  So no wonder, according to a latest Fox News poll, 62% of Republicans feel betrayed by the party and two-thirds believe the GOP leadership has not done anything to stop the Obama agenda.
[00:38:18.053 --> 00:38:19.073]  And here's why.
[00:38:19.093 --> 00:38:28.378]  Now some people are speculating that Boehner is going to go and have a prominent position in the Jeb Bush campaign because he is all for another Bush presidency.
[00:38:28.759 --> 00:38:30.159]  Wouldn't that be so great?
[00:38:30.239 --> 00:38:30.760]  But indeed,
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:38.462]  Boehner seems to have been the wolf in sheep's clothing there, helping to push the leftist agenda.
[00:38:38.582 --> 00:38:43.704]  So, here you go, Boehner, shedding a tear for all of your hard work.
[00:38:43.744 --> 00:38:46.725]  What a stellar job you have done selling out the country.
[00:38:47.025 --> 00:38:50.786]  Everybody who knows me knows that I get emotional about certain things.
[00:38:54.627 --> 00:38:56.088]  And I think the top of our list
[00:38:58.897 --> 00:39:02.840]  It's providing for the safety and security of the American people.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.000]  When are we going to defeat them?
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:04.941]  No, no, no.
[00:39:04.961 --> 00:39:05.621]  My nose is blowing.
[00:39:05.641 --> 00:39:06.262]  That wasn't up to you.
[00:39:06.322 --> 00:39:07.983]  No, it's not.
[00:39:08.023 --> 00:39:15.207]  What set you off that time?
[00:39:16.768 --> 00:39:22.292]  Making sure that these kids have a shot at the American dream.
[00:39:23.372 --> 00:39:23.853]  My God.
[00:39:23.893 --> 00:39:26.314]  It's important.
[00:39:35.993 --> 00:39:45.179]  I put myself through school, working every rotten job there was.
[00:39:45.199 --> 00:39:48.241]  I wanted to make sure every kid had the same chance in life.
[00:39:50.722 --> 00:39:52.664]  And I could do that.
[00:39:52.724 --> 00:39:54.124]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:39:54.585 --> 00:39:57.467]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[00:39:57.487 --> 00:39:59.608]  Oh my gosh, you should start crying.
[00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:02.089]  Put it back on screen.
[00:40:03.248 --> 00:40:05.530]  I certainly don't want the institution to go through this.
[00:40:26.764 --> 00:40:26.924]  Yes.
[00:40:45.391 --> 00:40:48.274]  His diplomatic immunity was revoked?
[00:40:48.774 --> 00:40:50.636]  So what is diplomatic immunity?
[00:40:50.916 --> 00:41:06.049]  Well, diplomatic immunity is a form of legal immunity that ensures diplomats are given safe passage and are considered not susceptible to lawsuit or prosecution under the host country's laws, although they can still be expelled.
[00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:11.931]  Immunity, when you hear that word, it's kind of more like a license to crime.
[00:41:12.451 --> 00:41:17.272]  And apparently it seems that this diplomatic community might be being abused by Saudi royals.
[00:41:17.632 --> 00:41:28.115]  So again, back in California, this is coming out of the LA Times, a bleeding woman screaming for help as she tried to scale an eight foot high wall.
[00:41:28.875 --> 00:41:37.416]  Uh, was found after she was trying to escape a property where various foreign nationals have been renting it out for weeks at a time over the last year.
[00:41:37.436 --> 00:41:45.238]  Well, the current tenant is a Saudi prince who allegedly tried to force a female worker to perform a sex act on him.
[00:41:45.738 --> 00:41:49.939]  And now this same guy has been accused of attacking other women in this home.
[00:41:50.279 --> 00:41:51.819]  And this is according to the LAPD.
[00:41:52.139 --> 00:41:57.660]  Detectives found more victims who are also alleging crimes against Mr. Al Saud.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:07.948]  Now, he was held on suspicion of false imprisonment, sexual assault, and battery, but he was ultimately booked for alleged forced oral copulation.
[00:42:08.409 --> 00:42:14.333]  Now, he was released on $300,000 bail, and he's scheduled to appear in court October 19th.
[00:42:14.714 --> 00:42:23.001]  But of course, it's going to be really interesting to see if he flees the country now that he's out on bail, lest he be charged with a crime.
[00:42:23.621 --> 00:42:29.246]  Now, this is the same type of criminal behavior that's being reported in India and probably other countries as well.
[00:42:30.187 --> 00:42:33.670]  But there, a Saudi diplomat has been accused of raping two maids.
[00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:45.039]  And he's, the country itself is really embarrassed about this because he's going to enjoy not only diplomatic immunity, but also blind support from his superiors.
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:57.973]  So these women say that for more than three months, they were forced to not only do all the chores from morning till night, but then they were brutally gang raped by seven to eight men involved there at that household.
[00:42:57.993 --> 00:43:04.340]  They said, if we resisted, the diplomat and his family would threaten to kill us and dispose of our bodies in the sewer.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.662]  And this is according to one of those women.
[00:43:09.312 --> 00:43:16.758]  When the Pope is admonishing everyone there and talking that we all need to band together to end slavery, is this what he's talking about?
[00:43:17.079 --> 00:43:24.345]  Because again and again we're hearing these stories of slaves or domestic servants in these royal households being mistreated.
[00:43:25.666 --> 00:43:27.307]  Chained up, not allowed to leave.
[00:43:27.347 --> 00:43:35.171]  In 2011, a case in the UK involving two women who were held in slave-like conditions by a Saudi diplomat in London.
[00:43:35.651 --> 00:43:46.036]  And another case in 2013 here in the United States involved two women held as domestic slaves for months by the Saudi defense attache and his wife.
[00:43:46.336 --> 00:43:48.457]  In both cases, diplomatic immunity
[00:43:48.997 --> 00:43:50.078]  I don't think so.
[00:44:10.089 --> 00:44:15.471]  No, it's not the elite and their domestic servants that are of most concern.
[00:44:16.031 --> 00:44:21.974]  It's about arbitrary identity politics and political correctness and controlling the rest of us.
[00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:24.712]  Like, look here in Canada.
[00:44:25.032 --> 00:44:31.117]  They are looking to ban the word mother and father on government forms in the name of inclusiveness.
[00:44:31.618 --> 00:44:34.100]  They're going to be switching it out with the terms parent or guardian.
[00:44:34.781 --> 00:44:36.662]  One person said, screw you, Ontario.
[00:44:36.903 --> 00:44:37.743]  I am a mother.
[00:44:37.984 --> 00:44:39.505]  I gave birth to my babies.
[00:44:39.745 --> 00:44:41.387]  Stop effing with my rights.
[00:44:41.607 --> 00:44:43.529]  I was born, not made.
[00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:45.610]  And of course, they want you to forget that.
[00:44:46.471 --> 00:44:49.835]  This is political correctness run amok.
[00:44:50.255 --> 00:44:51.536]  Welcome to the new world order.
[00:44:51.897 --> 00:44:53.498]  It's not about inclusiveness.
[00:44:53.819 --> 00:44:55.400]  It is about total control.
[00:44:56.678 --> 00:45:05.780]  Authoritarians merely want obedience, while totalitarians, whose rule is rooted in an ideology, want obedience and conversion.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:15.162]  The authoritarians are the guys in charge who want to stay in charge, and they don't much care about you or what you're doing, so long as you stay out of their way.
[00:45:15.742 --> 00:45:17.783]  Live or die, it's all same to the regime.
[00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:21.551]  Totalitarians are a different breed.
[00:45:22.131 --> 00:45:31.858]  These are the people who have a plan, who think they see the future more clearly than you, or who are convinced they grasp reality in a way that you do not.
[00:45:32.518 --> 00:45:42.265]  They don't serve themselves, they serve history, or the people, or the idea, or some other ideological totem that justifies their actions.
[00:45:42.926 --> 00:45:44.487]  They want obedience, of course,
[00:45:44.987 --> 00:45:51.129]  But even more, they want their rule and their belief system to be accepted and self-sustaining.
[00:45:51.609 --> 00:45:56.911]  And the only way to achieve that is to create a new society of people who share those beliefs.
[00:45:57.291 --> 00:46:00.632]  Even if it means bludgeoning every last citizen into enlightenment.
[00:46:01.272 --> 00:46:05.035]  That's what makes totalitarians different and more dangerous.
[00:46:05.696 --> 00:46:14.363]  They are totalistic in the sense they demand a complete reorientation of the individual to the state and its ideological ends.
[00:46:14.963 --> 00:46:22.509]  Every person who harbors a secret objection, or even so much as a doubt, is a danger to the future of the whole project.
[00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:27.934]  And so the regime compels its subjects not only to obey, but to believe.
[00:46:38.044 --> 00:46:44.367]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:46:44.707 --> 00:46:46.188]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:46:46.208 --> 00:46:47.589]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:46:47.869 --> 00:46:48.989]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:54.312]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:54.412 --> 00:46:58.534]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:46:58.914 --> 00:47:00.375]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:47:00.395 --> 00:47:01.736]  This is the best iodine out there.

[00:47:07.895 --> 00:47:12.739]  And why wearing a Hillary for President t-shirt might get you punched in the face.
[00:47:13.139 --> 00:47:15.001]  They thought it said Hillary for President.
[00:47:15.862 --> 00:47:20.326]  He said, I was seconds away from sending my bar back over here to punch you in the face.
[00:47:20.566 --> 00:47:24.409]  Since you're wearing a Hillary for Prison shirt, you don't have to buy drinks here.
[00:47:24.729 --> 00:47:25.810]  Everything's on the house.
[00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:27.312]  Hillary for Prison!
[00:47:28.012 --> 00:47:29.714]  Hillary's not surging, I tell you that.
[00:47:29.754 --> 00:47:30.574]  They're not saying that.
[00:47:30.594 --> 00:47:32.116]  They're not saying that.
[00:47:32.936 --> 00:47:33.317]  Thank you.
[00:47:49.633 --> 00:47:50.114]  Oh my God!
[00:48:04.975 --> 00:48:08.396]  There you have it, Donald Trump endorses Hillary for prison.
[00:48:08.976 --> 00:48:13.098]  Get your Hillary for prison 2016 t-shirt at the Infowars store.
[00:48:13.378 --> 00:48:15.999]  And on the back it says, legalize freedom.
[00:48:16.419 --> 00:48:20.140]  Show your disapproval of Hillary by buying your t-shirt today.
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:21.700]  But what she's done is criminal.
[00:48:22.881 --> 00:48:25.422]  This is an American president.
[00:48:25.782 --> 00:48:29.563]  Just add puppet, then vote and repeat every four years.
[00:48:39.988 --> 00:48:40.389]  I think so.
[00:48:46.988 --> 00:48:55.091]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight, and as we see from this perspective, we can see a little bit of the U.N., but of course you can see a lot more of the police.
[00:48:55.171 --> 00:49:05.775]  The perimeter extends two blocks on either side of the road, the 43rd Street that goes down to the U.N., and of course you can't get any closer than 2nd Street, which is a couple blocks away.
[00:49:05.795 --> 00:49:07.296]  It's a huge perimeter they've put around here.
[00:49:07.796 --> 00:49:10.137]  Thousands and thousands of police officers.
[00:49:10.217 --> 00:49:11.417]  This is what it's come to.
[00:49:11.657 --> 00:49:12.978]  This is the total police state.
[00:49:13.598 --> 00:49:15.100]  But what is its ultimate objective?
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.544]  Its ultimate objective is not to protect one individual.
[00:49:17.584 --> 00:49:22.110]  Its ultimate objective is to set down a new agenda for sustainability.
[00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:25.755]  This is what the UN spokesmen on the news are openly saying now.
[00:49:26.476 --> 00:49:30.281]  UN Agenda 21, which came from this building right here to my left,
[00:49:31.122 --> 00:49:33.624]  That was something that was essentially kept quiet.
[00:49:34.124 --> 00:49:38.448]  They enacted that locally, one by one, talking about sustainability.
[00:49:38.468 --> 00:49:40.709]  We understand what was behind Agenda 21.
[00:49:40.749 --> 00:49:49.096]  That was to concentrate everyone into very confined, very concentrated cities where you have very small apartments that you live in.
[00:49:49.156 --> 00:49:51.697]  You're blocked from going pretty much anywhere you want to go.
[00:49:52.498 --> 00:49:58.642]  And of course they're going to be using a transportation control grid to do that because they have to basically keep you in those cities.
[00:49:58.682 --> 00:50:02.644]  That's going to be very easy to do once they set up the autonomous cars, the monitored highways.
[00:50:03.084 --> 00:50:07.747]  They're getting ready to do something that is going to be top-down and very visible.
[00:50:07.787 --> 00:50:10.689]  It's not going to be from the bottom up like UN Agenda 21.
[00:50:10.949 --> 00:50:13.210]  This is going to be a top-down and forced agenda.
[00:50:13.711 --> 00:50:19.074]  So the guy they've got to sell it, because they have to try to make some kind of a moral case for it, is going to be the Pope.
[00:50:19.534 --> 00:50:20.854]  That's what's so dangerous about this.
[00:50:21.194 --> 00:50:25.095]  He's trying to make a moral case for global governance.
[00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:26.736]  That's why he's here at the UN.
[00:50:26.956 --> 00:50:34.038]  That's why every one of the country's leaders are here today to listen to the Pope, including Obama.
[00:50:34.498 --> 00:50:36.338]  That's why you have such high security.
[00:50:36.378 --> 00:50:39.659]  They're ready to roll out a new world government.
[00:50:40.259 --> 00:50:42.701]  That's what the climate change agenda is about.
[00:50:42.741 --> 00:50:44.603]  You have to have a way to regulate everybody.
[00:50:44.623 --> 00:50:46.284]  You have to have a way to tax everybody.
[00:50:46.844 --> 00:50:50.588]  That's why they're focusing on some kind of a global necessity to do it.
[00:50:50.908 --> 00:50:54.891]  And, of course, they have to come out and make it sound like it is a moral case.
[00:50:54.931 --> 00:50:59.155]  They're losing on the scientific side, so they have to make this a moral issue.
[00:50:59.175 --> 00:51:02.377]  And a part of that, as well, is erasing international borders.
[00:51:02.958 --> 00:51:08.863]  The perfect storm of all of these issues comes together right here at the UN with the Pope,
[00:51:09.543 --> 00:51:12.510]  Making a case for world government later today stay with us.
[00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:15.136]  We'll be right back with more reports from Infowars.com.
[00:51:15.156 --> 00:51:15.757]  I'm David Knight
[00:51:27.728 --> 00:51:31.530]  Well if you want to understand the Pope's politics, just look at what he spoke on.
[00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:38.694]  Abolishing the death penalty, calling for action against global warming, demanding tolerance for immigrants.
[00:51:39.054 --> 00:51:42.676]  But what he wasn't very clear on, life and family.
[00:51:42.896 --> 00:51:48.099]  He certainly didn't call for defunding Planned Parenthood while he was there speaking in front of Congress.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:52:07.245]  I don't think anyone here disagrees that we should be living sustainably, but we the people are being blamed for everything that the people in power and those who are creating these problems, they're the ones that are creating this mess at the top, but it's being blamed on the rest of us.
[00:52:07.745 --> 00:52:09.146]  You want to stop mass migration?
[00:52:09.386 --> 00:52:11.927]  Well, stop creating the conditions that are at its core.
[00:52:12.188 --> 00:52:18.731]  If you want to save the environment, maybe check the agency here who's in control of that, the Environmental Protection Agency.
[00:52:19.292 --> 00:52:24.915]  They have spent more than $92 million taxpayer dollars on high-end furniture.
[00:52:25.395 --> 00:52:27.096]  Apparently, office furniture
[00:52:29.048 --> 00:52:35.094]  Like hexagon wooden tables and an $800 pencil drawer was so important.
[00:52:35.515 --> 00:52:43.363]  Or just take a look at the huge corporations that are exploiting all of these resources while we're being blamed on the drought and global warming.
[00:52:43.683 --> 00:52:44.283]  Like Nestle.
[00:52:44.884 --> 00:52:49.850]  Nestle boss is saying that he wants to bottle more water in California despite this drought.
[00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:53.614]  He said he wants to actually increase the amount of groundwater that's used.
[00:52:53.995 --> 00:52:59.521]  And he said, the fact is, if I stop bottling it tomorrow, people are just going to be buying another brand of water.
[00:53:00.322 --> 00:53:03.343]  You know, and then we've got investors are mining for water.
[00:53:03.403 --> 00:53:05.383]  They're calling it the next hot commodity.
[00:53:05.784 --> 00:53:07.364]  So that's what this is all about.
[00:53:07.664 --> 00:53:14.186]  This UN agenda, it's not about good feelings and sustainability and kindness and all that.
[00:53:14.726 --> 00:53:16.026]  It is about control.
[00:53:16.287 --> 00:53:20.848]  And it's about controlling us, the little people, and making us feel guilty for all of it.
[00:53:21.648 --> 00:53:34.777]  He had one other thing, too, I want to tell you, Alex, and that was when he met privately with the clergy, I believe it was a private meeting in Washington that this quote came out of, but he was talking to the church leaders that were there, and this is what he had to say to them.
[00:53:34.877 --> 00:53:46.185]  He said, many of you have suffered greatly in the not-too-distant past by having to bear the shame of some of your brothers who harmed and scandalized the church and the most vulnerable of her members.
[00:53:46.909 --> 00:53:47.529]  Do you catch that?
[00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:57.257]  The only thing he really had to say about the pedophile controversy within the Roman Catholic Church was, I'm sorry that some of you were embarrassed by being connected with that.
[00:53:57.917 --> 00:53:59.958]  He doesn't talk about the heinousness of this.
[00:54:00.259 --> 00:54:02.801]  And Alex, when I look at the way he's proud of people... He didn't personalize it.
[00:54:03.021 --> 00:54:06.703]  He just said, I'm sorry it embarrassed our thing.
[00:54:07.484 --> 00:54:09.025]  Yes, it embarrassed our institution.
[00:54:09.265 --> 00:54:11.046]  I'm sorry because you're part of the institution.
[00:54:11.327 --> 00:54:15.690]  But just like we see with the police, they don't purge the evildoers out of their midst.
[00:54:16.539 --> 00:54:18.379]  That is how you embrace corruption.
[00:54:18.399 --> 00:54:19.900]  That's how you propagate corruption.
[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:23.861]  And I thought it was absolutely outrageous that that's the only thing that we've seen of that.
[00:54:24.261 --> 00:54:29.062]  If you want to talk about how you are there to help the children, then do something to help the children.
[00:54:29.222 --> 00:54:34.344]  Stop people from killing them and selling their baby parts, and stop people from molesting them sexually.
[00:54:34.644 --> 00:54:38.345]  Then we can have a conversation about what else you want to do to protect the children.
[00:54:38.605 --> 00:54:43.606]  But people need to understand that the thousands, tens of thousands of people, whatever, that are here,
[00:54:43.946 --> 00:55:00.775]  They need to understand that this moral high ground that he has is simply a mask, a facade for a globalist agenda so they can rule the world and you can see that with the confluence of the Pope and the Chinese President and Obama coming together on this next step of global governance.
[00:55:01.775 --> 00:55:05.297]  It's a Pope joins forces with Obama and Communist China to take over the world.
[00:55:05.718 --> 00:55:15.203]  This is a true axis of eugenics, a true axis of destroying any type of industrialization, clean industrialization around the world.
[00:55:15.243 --> 00:55:17.164]  Thank you so much, David Knight.
[00:55:17.204 --> 00:55:17.584]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:55:19.246 --> 00:55:40.361]  What began with the disgusting revelations of the British Top of the Pops host Jimmy Seville and his decades of rampant pedophilia, necrophilia, and Satanism has convulsed into a full-fledged unmasking of a three decades long cowboy ring fueled by government officials, entertainers, government spies, and royal palace workers.
[00:55:40.782 --> 00:55:46.686]  The focus of the investigation rests on the West London location known as the Elm Guesthouse.
[00:55:46.986 --> 00:55:52.451]  Elm Guesthouse, a former gay brothel where young children are also said to have been molested.
[00:55:52.931 --> 00:56:02.000]  I think Richard's transporting over to the United Kingdom mainland to be abused, rather than just being abused in Northern Ireland, speaks volumes.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.062]  It ties the two together.
[00:56:04.682 --> 00:56:07.646]  The Elm Guesthouse fronted as a gay bathhouse.
[00:56:08.067 --> 00:56:14.375]  As numerous victims have attested to, it was primarily a child sex abuse house of horrors for the elite.
[00:56:14.896 --> 00:56:22.366]  The revelations are so vast and damaging, the English government was forced to declare the investigation a national security issue.
[00:56:22.526 --> 00:56:33.109]  The seedy side of British culture only serves to gain momentum as details emerge of Prime Minister Cameron simulating fornication with a pig during a college occult ritual.
[00:56:33.329 --> 00:56:35.510]  And the elite relish their rituals.
[00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:46.293]  Hermetic rituals originating from the ancient Egyptian city of Khmun, or Hermopolis, a Greek synthesis of the worship of Thoth with that of the Greek god Hermes.
[00:56:46.573 --> 00:57:01.841]  Hermeticism reached a cultural metamorphosis in the modern age by several 19th century authors including Alephus Levi, Samuel Lydell McGregor Mathers, Arthur Edward Waite, and Waite's golden-dawn nemesis, pedophile, Aleister Crowley.
[00:57:02.241 --> 00:57:07.904]  Crowley was quoted as saying, A made child of perfect innocence is the most suitable victim.
[00:57:08.504 --> 00:57:13.786]  And with this sentiment in mind, he set up his Abbey of Thelema in Sicily, Italy.
[00:57:14.186 --> 00:57:20.307]  This Abbey served Crowley as a laboratory of sex magic, ranging from ritual sacrifice to pedophilia.
[00:57:20.808 --> 00:57:27.570]  In 1923, Crowley was booted out of Italy by Benito Mussolini after news of a death at the Abbey was reported.
[00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:32.291]  Crowley, penniless and a hardcore heroin addict, then landed in France.
[00:57:32.751 --> 00:57:56.341]  As ridiculous as it may seem, unconfirmed claims tie the conception of Barbara Bush to the adulterous union of Aleister Crowley and Pauline Pierce, conducted during a sex magic ritual that occurred in France in 1924, possibly making George W. the grandson of the wickedest man in the world, which if true, would definitely add more weight to the ritualistic events surrounding the tragedy of 9-11.
[00:57:57.001 --> 00:57:59.382]  Crowley's rockstar-esque influence
[00:57:59.662 --> 00:58:04.443]  has spread through entertainment, Freemasonry and political spheres for decades.
[00:58:04.983 --> 00:58:23.287]  It's no wonder that the unnatural and hidden world of pedophilia running rampant within the highest places of power would strive to be finally accepted as a sexual preference by an obligated sycophantic press catering to their globalist pedophile masters to test the moral and ethical waters of the public mind.
[00:58:23.627 --> 00:58:24.707]  Thanks for watching.
[00:58:24.727 --> 00:58:26.848]  That's it for the show tonight.
