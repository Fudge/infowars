[00:00:00.985 --> 00:00:03.590]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:20.495]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:21.957]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.738 --> 00:00:23.639]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.923]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.483 --> 00:00:32.548]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:49.324 --> 00:01:02.198]  David Knight and Joe Biggs are in Virginia where there is a giant anti-gun, anti-self-defense feeding frenzy going on on the heels of the tragic live television shooting yesterday.
[00:01:02.218 --> 00:01:08.806]  We now have two dead TV station members and of course the shooter.
[00:01:10.267 --> 00:01:12.688]  Who is an Obama bot.
[00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:16.711]  Got in trouble for wearing Obama pins during election coverage.
[00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:20.213]  Basically got in fights with everybody.
[00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.214]  His own manifesto says black people didn't like him.
[00:01:23.295 --> 00:01:24.575]  White people didn't like him.
[00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:26.136]  Women didn't like him.
[00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:28.017]  A spoiled brat.
[00:01:28.097 --> 00:01:29.098]  Clearly mentally ill.
[00:01:29.218 --> 00:01:33.040]  And now we're getting reports that he was under some type of mental treatment.
[00:01:34.221 --> 00:01:36.062]  So we're burrowing in right now.
[00:01:36.142 --> 00:01:37.703]  Was he on medication?
[00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:42.543]  Obviously being under psychiatric care, being under...
[00:01:43.638 --> 00:01:48.702]  Counseling, it goes to say, normally you are on some type of medication.
[00:01:49.082 --> 00:01:53.666]  That's what most psychologists and psychiatrists have become, is basically pill dispensers.
[00:01:54.286 --> 00:01:57.829]  Well, psychiatrists always have been, but more and more counselors.
[00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:07.476]  And there are some good counselors out there, I'm not demonizing their entire profession, but more and more it's a political tool of oppression, clearly, and it's been that way in many other countries around the world.
[00:02:08.156 --> 00:02:12.640]  I kept saying yesterday, ad nauseum, and I'm not bragging, I'm just saying we know what we're talking about,
[00:02:14.326 --> 00:02:15.407]  Don't need to go back and play the clips.
[00:02:15.447 --> 00:02:23.477]  I probably said it 50 times that this was tied to Charleston in South Carolina.
[00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:26.140]  And sure enough, he said,
[00:02:28.168 --> 00:02:34.891]  That he did it because of the Charleston shooter, that that's what pushed him over the edge because nine black people were killed.
[00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:41.654]  And so this is fundamentally the big fat seeds of race war in this country.
[00:02:42.094 --> 00:02:51.279]  Because now if some other unstable white person strikes back, and then some other unstable black person strikes back, this could really start to unravel.
[00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:55.821]  And that's why the system wants the collapse that's coming to this country.
[00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:02.498]  To be racial in nature, as a distraction to scapegoat different groups against each other.
[00:03:02.518 --> 00:03:19.736]  That's why Europe is allowing, and putting people on welfare, the massive unfettered flood of illegals from the Middle East, Africa, Asia, you name it, into Europe and then giving them massive welfare to incentivize it no matter how destructive it is.
[00:03:21.052 --> 00:03:34.104]  No matter how many cities get lit on fire, because under the economic collapse, whoever is middle class and left will end up siding with the government in the end, who will come in as the saviors to protect the public.
[00:03:34.604 --> 00:03:36.926]  And I've got not one, but two articles today
[00:03:37.927 --> 00:03:42.112]  Paul Joseph Watson wrote an article for InfoWars.com.
[00:03:42.152 --> 00:03:43.293]  He's joining us in 30 minutes.
[00:03:43.613 --> 00:03:44.575]  Steve Quayle is coming on.
[00:03:44.595 --> 00:03:47.998]  Again, our reporters will join us from Virginia at the start of the next hour.
[00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.962]  France prepares for mass unrest.
[00:03:51.422 --> 00:03:54.826]  Radicalized immigrants taking over cities.
[00:03:54.886 --> 00:03:58.050]  And this is a Ministry of Defense report from France.
[00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.690]  Because it's the military's job to assess threats.
[00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:02.751]  They're compartmentalized.
[00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:03.872]  They're not part of the takeover.
[00:04:04.273 --> 00:04:06.775]  They're just going to respond when things break down.
[00:04:06.795 --> 00:04:11.158]  And they say RPGs and anti-aircraft missiles have been smuggled in from Libya and Syria.
[00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:12.359]  Oh, sorry.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:24.409]  I probably said a thousand times in the last four years since Libya that you will then hear they're going to shoot down jetliners with the missiles, but never a discussion of why they got them.
[00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:26.250]  They're now getting everybody ready.
[00:04:27.093 --> 00:04:38.321]  For the jihadis, like the guy that tried to attack on the train last Friday, to have Stinger missiles, RPGs, and AK-47s that the police are starting to find all over the country.
[00:04:42.614 --> 00:04:43.675]  So you see how that works.
[00:04:43.835 --> 00:04:45.015]  Not hard to predict this stuff.
[00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:50.658]  Other people don't seem to be able to, which just shows how dumb most pundits and analysts are.
[00:04:51.578 --> 00:04:52.619]  And then this dovetails with it.
[00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:55.200]  Fort Bragg troops trained for domestic emergency.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.501]  This exercise is about the home front.
[00:04:58.461 --> 00:05:00.843]  And that is from ABC News 11.
[00:05:02.323 --> 00:05:03.544]  So, there you go.
[00:05:03.584 --> 00:05:06.525]  They're now going mainstream with it, which means they're getting close.
[00:05:06.545 --> 00:05:07.846]  They're thinking about pulling the trigger.
[00:05:10.205 --> 00:05:15.647]  We now know why StemXpress was so desperate to censor the undercover Planned Parenthood video featuring its CEO.
[00:05:16.067 --> 00:05:27.872]  The law prohibits organ and tissue donors from selling for profit, yet solicitation materials from StemXpress repeatedly tout how financially profitable and rewarding and beneficial it can be to the fiscal growth for abortion clinics.
[00:05:28.072 --> 00:05:35.158]  And when asked what they can do to help clinics that aren't profiting, the CEO is astonished and says she doesn't know any who aren't profiting.
[00:05:35.378 --> 00:05:36.799]  You want to say this is about women's health?
[00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:43.345]  She talks about the contamination of samples with staff due to unsanitary clinic conditions being a repeated problem.
[00:05:43.585 --> 00:05:48.529]  And the StemExpress CEO talks about the stigma of delivering butchered baby parts to labs.
[00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:49.489]  How they freak out.
[00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:51.610]  How they have meltdowns when they get a whole head.
[00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.352]  How they'll request hands and feet to be removed from limbs so they don't have to confront what it is.
[00:05:56.452 --> 00:05:58.813]  But then she comments, but we know what it is.
[00:05:59.213 --> 00:06:03.495]  For that reason, she says, many are turning to adult stem cells or bone marrow.
[00:06:03.795 --> 00:06:04.475]  And she concludes,
[00:06:04.795 --> 00:06:06.335]  You're either in the cause or not.
[00:06:06.435 --> 00:06:06.656]  Yeah.
[00:06:06.956 --> 00:06:09.596]  This is David Knight, reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:06:10.256 --> 00:06:17.198]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.083]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:48.871]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:07:49.211 --> 00:07:55.415]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:07:55.795 --> 00:08:00.804]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[00:08:28.072 --> 00:08:29.494]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:08:29.754 --> 00:08:30.935]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:31.415 --> 00:08:36.180]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:38.682 --> 00:08:39.483]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:08:39.543 --> 00:08:46.490]  Welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this live, Thursday, worldwide transmission, the 27th day of August, 2015.
[00:08:51.784 --> 00:08:52.965]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:53.466 --> 00:09:02.615]  We have Steve Quayle joining us for an hour and a half at the middle way of the transmission today at 1230 noon central.
[00:09:03.176 --> 00:09:09.142]  We have our reporters from the site of the tragic shooting yesterday in a rural area.
[00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:17.845]  Two hours away from major airports in Virginia where this tragic event with the shooting live on television took place.
[00:09:18.345 --> 00:09:26.068]  And Paul Joseph Watson joins us from London to break down a report he's written for Infowars.com.
[00:09:26.548 --> 00:09:31.389]  France prepares for mass unrest, radicalized immigrants taking over cities.
[00:09:31.909 --> 00:09:37.071]  That's an Army Ministry of Defense report released to the media.
[00:09:38.317 --> 00:09:40.978]  Also, there's video of this out of North Carolina.
[00:09:40.998 --> 00:09:49.399]  We're going to be playing that, ABC 11, in a Max Slavo article at Infowars.com.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.920]  Fort Bragg troops train for domestic emergency.
[00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:58.621]  This exercise is about the home front, ostensibly.
[00:09:59.002 --> 00:10:03.943]  And on the surface, they're trained to help out with things like natural disasters, floods, and hurricanes.
[00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:05.323]  But this is regular arming.
[00:10:09.053 --> 00:10:12.214]  They're gearing up for the collapse, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:12.254 --> 00:10:27.419]  I want to be clear, whatever we warn of the lurch into the police state, the lurch into globalism, federalism, the lurch into centralization, we're not saying it's imminent, or it's going to happen overnight, or troops trying to stabilize a burning city.
[00:10:27.879 --> 00:10:28.960]  We're not trying to say they're the enemy.
[00:10:29.741 --> 00:10:39.864]  The globalists have created the climate where you're going to beg, and I'm going to beg, for the big red one to come down the street in armored vehicles.
[00:10:41.021 --> 00:10:45.182]  And we're trying to stop the globalists from maneuvering us into this position.
[00:10:45.922 --> 00:10:58.105]  They're running around in newspapers, I mean, every couple days around the country, because they know national media has no respect with locals, but local media still has some, though it's lost a lot of credibility.
[00:10:58.505 --> 00:11:03.186]  In the big national studies, there's a new one out today, and they're running stories like this one.
[00:11:03.206 --> 00:11:09.567]  We actually got the newspaper itself, The Inlander, the major newspaper for Spokane and four counties,
[00:11:10.538 --> 00:11:18.682]  Daring to tread why Spokane's Republican Sheriff says we should be scared of homegrown extremists and the fanatical fringe of the Tea Party.
[00:11:20.103 --> 00:11:23.965]  And he's a microcosm of what they're gearing up for.
[00:11:23.985 --> 00:11:31.869]  And this all broke last year again when he had these armored vehicles being delivered and they were at Walmart saying, therefore the Tea Party, therefore the Constitutionalist.
[00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.571]  So we ran the video and said this is wrong.
[00:11:34.631 --> 00:11:35.731]  Drudge and others picked it up.
[00:11:36.092 --> 00:11:37.052]  World and Daily picked it up.
[00:11:37.472 --> 00:11:38.293]  The story went viral.
[00:11:39.215 --> 00:11:41.737]  And he first came out and said, we're liars, it's not for us.
[00:11:42.918 --> 00:11:44.159]  Then we said, no, you're a liar.
[00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:46.801]  So he said Alex Jones and Infowars is threatening to kill me.
[00:11:47.782 --> 00:11:50.504]  When it was comments on the site, which anybody could do.
[00:11:53.526 --> 00:11:56.489]  I mean, I could go on the Inlander and put comments and then say they said it.
[00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:57.310]  I mean, it's just.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.883]  Very bizarre, and he keeps warning of something's about to happen.
[00:12:02.604 --> 00:12:05.046]  I really see this as a prime false flag zone.
[00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:07.908]  That's what my spider sense, common sense, tells me.
[00:12:08.188 --> 00:12:13.793]  Now, by exposing it, it may not happen, but I think the sheriff's a really, really bad person.
[00:12:15.097 --> 00:12:15.998]  From everything he's done.
[00:12:16.738 --> 00:12:19.741]  He speaks with a forked tongue and I think he's playing people.
[00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:35.614]  And I may just go to a county nearby and not even go into his jurisdiction and call for peace when I go out there and see if he'll come to the county line because I don't even know if it's safe to even get within his jurisdiction with the history of his deputies, the things he's been involved in, bizarre deaths.
[00:12:36.635 --> 00:12:38.217]  This is a pretty bad guy.
[00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:40.959]  The Southern Property Law Center might have something on him.
[00:12:41.259 --> 00:12:41.780]  I'm not sure.
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:42.700]  I'm speculating there.
[00:12:43.956 --> 00:12:48.279]  This is a microcosm, a canary in the coal mine, with things like this going on.
[00:12:48.299 --> 00:13:02.250]  And they're looking for provocations in different zones around the country to be trigger events to paint the Liberty Movement as terroristic when they start the Soros race war that we're battling to stop.
[00:13:04.864 --> 00:13:05.945]  We know our stuff.
[00:13:06.005 --> 00:13:10.507]  You could call it criminology, modus operandi, studying human behaviorism.
[00:13:10.847 --> 00:13:13.568]  I've been on air 20 plus years, almost 21.
[00:13:15.249 --> 00:13:18.250]  I've been immersed in this sometimes 18 hours a day.
[00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.032]  I'll be honest, the last couple of years, I can't do more than 10 hours a day.
[00:13:22.112 --> 00:13:23.012]  I just, it's too much.
[00:13:23.452 --> 00:13:24.713]  I'm not as immersed as I used to be.
[00:13:24.773 --> 00:13:28.494]  It's just because every data point opens up a whole other data set for me.
[00:13:28.554 --> 00:13:31.916]  And it just, I actually know too much now and I just can't handle it.
[00:13:33.049 --> 00:13:35.010]  Back when I was trying to figure stuff out, it was kind of fun.
[00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.551]  To learn stuff now, it's just horrific.
[00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:38.432]  I mean, I'll be honest.
[00:13:39.492 --> 00:13:42.094]  But I got up here and I said, this guy will end up being mentally ill.
[00:13:42.374 --> 00:13:43.775]  He'll end up being on psychotropics.
[00:13:44.935 --> 00:13:45.936]  That's starting to come out.
[00:13:46.776 --> 00:13:56.061]  But I said, he did this probably because of Charleston and the nine innocent black people that were killed by the white guy hopped up on drugs again.
[00:13:57.121 --> 00:13:57.922]  Prescription drugs.
[00:13:59.312 --> 00:14:01.353]  I mean, it's not hard to make these connections.
[00:14:01.773 --> 00:14:03.094]  People are going, yeah, common sense.
[00:14:03.114 --> 00:14:04.615]  Well, none of the other media did it.
[00:14:05.355 --> 00:14:10.858]  And now his manifesto's out, and it turns out that it's basically a Black Lives Matter Obama drone.
[00:14:11.438 --> 00:14:16.260]  And so David Knight made the point to me on the phone this morning that this is Obama's first drone strike.
[00:14:17.061 --> 00:14:17.581]  Domestically.
[00:14:18.301 --> 00:14:26.465]  Because this is one of his drones out attacking, and when you get all this race war promotion on MSNBC and CNN and the
[00:14:28.775 --> 00:14:34.697]  Groups legitimizing, saying, let's go out, let's attack the white people, they're the cause of all the problems.
[00:14:35.217 --> 00:14:46.641]  You're going to have blowback to the knockout game and the looting and the robbing and the rest of it, when unstable white people start going out and killing black people, and then black people are going to respond to that as a chain reaction.
[00:14:48.542 --> 00:14:50.222]  But sure enough, that's now come out.
[00:14:51.342 --> 00:14:55.564]  After shooting, alleged gunman details grievances and suicide note.
[00:14:56.698 --> 00:15:17.866]  Or what you call his manifesto, revenge race murderer, bitter black reporter who gunned down white ex-colleagues, lived on air and posted the video online, blames Charleston shootings and anti-gay harassment in manifesto of why he did it.
[00:15:21.513 --> 00:15:24.615]  Continuing, he was the human tape recorder.
[00:15:24.696 --> 00:15:33.843]  How TV murderer was criticized by boss for appalling journalistic standards and reprimanded for wearing an Obama badge to report on elections.
[00:15:36.004 --> 00:15:39.387]  Continuing, after shooting, alleged government detailed grievances.
[00:15:39.407 --> 00:15:40.068]  Again, I mentioned that.
[00:15:40.088 --> 00:15:41.649]  I want to go over some of that.
[00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.590]  U.S.
[00:15:43.631 --> 00:15:46.213]  shooting video shocks internet in New Frontier.
[00:15:46.233 --> 00:15:47.714]  It's not New Frontier.
[00:15:47.734 --> 00:15:49.075]  What do you think military videos are?
[00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:52.329]  And of course, he's dead now.
[00:15:55.591 --> 00:16:02.473]  But that hasn't stopped Hillary Clinton and others from coming out and saying they blame the Second Amendment.
[00:16:02.533 --> 00:16:05.454]  Quote, we have to do something about gun violence in America.
[00:16:06.975 --> 00:16:08.075]  Well, we have, Hillary.
[00:16:08.575 --> 00:16:13.917]  That's why overall gun crime is down 51 to 52 percent since 1992.
[00:16:15.038 --> 00:16:17.619]  And Professor Lott says, I'm wrong, looking at the numbers.
[00:16:18.504 --> 00:16:19.865]  Fox News, he says, is wrong.
[00:16:20.185 --> 00:16:21.266]  He says it's 61.
[00:16:22.047 --> 00:16:25.189]  Well, we had a statistician go over the Justice Department numbers.
[00:16:25.289 --> 00:16:27.051]  First, it was 51.
[00:16:28.332 --> 00:16:30.073]  Then Fox News did their own analysis, said 51.
[00:16:30.113 --> 00:16:30.633]  Lott says 61.
[00:16:30.673 --> 00:16:31.314]  Whatever!
[00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:40.710]  They admit, even in the LA Times, that gun crime is way down, but perception is it's way up.
[00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:42.331]  This is the fraud.
[00:16:42.411 --> 00:16:48.457]  Just like the perception is, if you go swimming in the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean, great white sharks are going to eat you.
[00:16:49.318 --> 00:16:55.363]  You've got a better chance of being mugged by a leprechaun than you do being attacked by a great white shark.
[00:16:55.383 --> 00:16:59.287]  But again, I always use that analogy because it's just so ridiculous.
[00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:01.274]  Yeah, there's the LA Times.
[00:17:01.774 --> 00:17:05.157]  Gun crime plunged, but Americans think it's up, study says.
[00:17:05.937 --> 00:17:07.038]  And that's from two years ago.
[00:17:08.399 --> 00:17:10.961]  That's when they released the 20 years of numbers.
[00:17:11.581 --> 00:17:16.465]  And I'm just putting that up on screen because I get these emails and see comments, oh, he just makes all that up.
[00:17:17.045 --> 00:17:22.609]  Listen, I make mistakes here and there, and when we find out we make mistakes, we correct them.
[00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:24.631]  But we're very accurate.
[00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:28.815]  We know what we're talking about, and we immerse ourselves in the information.
[00:17:29.416 --> 00:17:31.838]  And the fact is, there is not an epidemic of gun violence.
[00:17:32.279 --> 00:17:40.668]  Most of the people being killed are criminals breaking into people's houses, or trying to carjack, or people shooting at the police, or other gangs shooting each other.
[00:17:40.848 --> 00:17:41.609]  Go look at the numbers!
[00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.973]  Most crime is criminals killing each other.
[00:17:46.224 --> 00:17:48.865]  Or citizens fighting back in justified shootings.
[00:17:49.385 --> 00:17:51.346]  Or police shooting people in justified shootings.
[00:17:51.826 --> 00:17:59.928]  And statistically, there are some bad cops out there, and they're trying to make them really bad with their training, but still, you count the number of people cops kill every year?
[00:18:00.068 --> 00:18:02.589]  It's a very small part of the overall issue.
[00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.411]  And I'm only saying that because it's not the biggest problem there is.
[00:18:08.339 --> 00:18:09.681]  George Soros says it is.
[00:18:09.821 --> 00:18:10.282]  It's not.
[00:18:10.722 --> 00:18:19.293]  It's part of causing a civil war in this country where they've got these federally controlled police running around saying, I'm a terrorist that wants dead cops.
[00:18:20.415 --> 00:18:22.978]  When all this stuff starts, folks, they're going to blame the Liberty Movement.
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.321]  We've got to stop it.
[00:18:26.206 --> 00:18:28.329]  Now let's go to this clip of Donald Trump getting it right.
[00:18:28.349 --> 00:18:29.370]  That's why he's so popular.
[00:18:29.911 --> 00:18:33.336]  Now even the establishment people are saying he has a chance to win.
[00:18:33.356 --> 00:18:38.022]  He said that mental health should be the focus and he's a strong Second Amendment supporter.
[00:18:38.062 --> 00:18:38.422]  Here it is.
[00:18:38.843 --> 00:18:41.026]  This isn't a gun problem, this is a mental problem.
[00:18:41.804 --> 00:18:52.411]  And, you know, you have cases where, like, had the veterans, had the guys that were shot recently, had they had weapons, they might have been able to save themselves.
[00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:53.151]  They would have been able.
[00:18:53.171 --> 00:18:54.132]  They were all heroes.
[00:18:54.172 --> 00:18:58.775]  They were all tremendous military men and they had absolutely no defense.
[00:18:59.455 --> 00:19:06.620]  And frankly, you know, a case like this, he snuck up on him, whether it was a gun or a knife or whatever it would have been, it would have been something.
[00:19:07.372 --> 00:19:11.237]  But, you know, you're not going to get rid of all guns, so I know one thing.
[00:19:11.318 --> 00:19:17.887]  If you tried to do it, the bad guys would have them, to use an expression, and the good folks would abide by the law.
[00:19:17.927 --> 00:19:21.532]  They'd be hopeless, and just, it would be a hopeless situation for them.
[00:19:22.501 --> 00:19:32.569]  And I think it's a big mistake, and I'm a very much Second Amendment person, Chris, and I know the arguments both ways very well, but I'm very much into the Second Amendment.
[00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:33.829]  You need protection.
[00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:49.361]  Now, you also have entertainment, and you have all sorts of activities and all of that, but taking that out of the picture, you know, most guns are used for recreational purposes, like people play golf and like people play other things, and hunting
[00:19:49.901 --> 00:20:02.671]  But beyond that, in terms of safety, you know, if you're sitting in a cabin someplace and you're not armed and somebody walks in with a gun, I'll tell you what, I'd rather be in that cabin with a gun than not with a gun.
[00:20:02.712 --> 00:20:03.993]  That I can tell you right now.
[00:20:04.153 --> 00:20:07.255]  I tell you, I mean, I'm liking Donald Trump more and more.
[00:20:07.275 --> 00:20:10.618]  It doesn't mean I trust him, but I tell you, I'm liking him a lot more.
[00:20:10.778 --> 00:20:13.700]  You're old enough to tell that something is definitely wrong.
[00:20:14.181 --> 00:20:16.623]  You've been paying attention for years and you're ready.
[00:20:17.143 --> 00:20:20.925]  You're probably frustrated because your children don't listen to your words of warning.
[00:20:21.505 --> 00:20:24.247]  What will you do when your grandkids show up hungry at your door?

[00:20:49.653 --> 00:20:50.373]  This capitalism?
[00:20:50.433 --> 00:20:56.555]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:56.595 --> 00:21:00.237]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:24:20.353 --> 00:24:21.814]  I got soul!
[00:24:21.995 --> 00:24:24.236]  And I'm super bad!
[00:24:50.433 --> 00:24:51.334]  That's right.
[00:24:51.454 --> 00:24:59.376]  I got a move that tells me what to do.
[00:24:59.536 --> 00:25:00.217]  I got a gut.
[00:25:00.377 --> 00:25:00.837]  I got a soul.
[00:25:16.101 --> 00:25:17.222]  One and only, bring us in.
[00:25:20.863 --> 00:25:24.685]  We're here live, Monday through Friday, 11am to 2pm Central.
[00:25:31.317 --> 00:25:32.839]  There's so much to break down here.
[00:25:32.859 --> 00:25:45.131]  I want to get more into the shooting, more of the response, but what this is diverting from is they're propping the stock market up artificially right now, but the fundamentals are imploding worldwide, so that won't be sustainable.
[00:25:45.451 --> 00:25:50.136]  Just like they've been propping China up for a year, but it's finally unraveling and still imploding.
[00:25:51.397 --> 00:25:52.999]  China has started selling U.S.
[00:25:53.079 --> 00:25:55.161]  Treasuries to support the Yuan.
[00:25:57.932 --> 00:26:02.034]  And an article asked the question, what if the crash is rigged like everything else?
[00:26:02.294 --> 00:26:02.734]  No kidding.
[00:26:04.435 --> 00:26:06.636]  We're also going to get into the tropical storm Erica.
[00:26:07.016 --> 00:26:09.177]  Targets Caribbean, Florida, Bahamas on alert.
[00:26:09.758 --> 00:26:11.539]  Hillary Clinton obviously in deep trouble.
[00:26:11.939 --> 00:26:14.420]  Quote, takes responsibility, says it wasn't the best choice.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.781]  Biden eyes officially running.
[00:26:17.161 --> 00:26:18.102]  Number one in the polls.
[00:26:20.063 --> 00:26:22.584]  That is all coming up.
[00:26:24.636 --> 00:26:31.060]  But first, I was about to do this during the break, here on the TV slash radio show, and I thought, why not just do it on air?
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.623]  Because I hadn't taken my survival shield, nascent iodine, yet, and I like to put it in a glass of water.
[00:26:36.643 --> 00:26:41.626]  I take about half a dropper, once a day.
[00:26:42.585 --> 00:26:44.966]  That's a little more than the dose that's recommended.
[00:26:45.006 --> 00:26:47.707]  Consult your physicians out there and see how it works for you.
[00:26:48.327 --> 00:26:50.667]  Much smaller dose was just three years ago when I started this.
[00:26:50.687 --> 00:26:53.508]  I think a larger dose, because I forget some days.
[00:26:53.568 --> 00:26:54.829]  I probably do it three or four days a week.
[00:26:55.709 --> 00:26:58.550]  In fact, I'm getting better about taking it every day, so I should probably reduce my dose.
[00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:00.290]  Hindsight's 20-20.
[00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:02.311]  I just greedily put too much in there.
[00:27:02.871 --> 00:27:04.411]  And then I take some Supermetal Vitality.
[00:27:04.471 --> 00:27:05.912]  It's even stronger under the tongue.
[00:27:06.692 --> 00:27:11.593]  But I just put it in water because it really has like a cola-y taste.
[00:27:12.053 --> 00:27:14.174]  When you mix it with the iodine, I take three dropperfuls.
[00:27:14.594 --> 00:27:15.034]  You know what?
[00:27:15.074 --> 00:27:16.214]  I'll just take four.
[00:27:16.234 --> 00:27:16.794]  I don't know.
[00:27:16.854 --> 00:27:17.154]  Whatever.
[00:27:17.174 --> 00:27:17.835]  I'm being bad here.
[00:27:20.275 --> 00:27:22.836]  In fact, somebody ran off of my Secret 12 that was in here.
[00:27:22.856 --> 00:27:25.216]  My Secret 12 is in here.
[00:27:25.236 --> 00:27:27.277]  Oh, it's underneath.
[00:27:28.786 --> 00:27:29.426]  I can't reach it.
[00:27:29.466 --> 00:27:31.448]  Will somebody give me my methylcobalamin please?
[00:27:31.508 --> 00:27:31.828]  Sorry.
[00:27:32.228 --> 00:27:33.409]  See, I didn't really prepare this.
[00:27:33.449 --> 00:27:37.151]  I was loading up this glass during the break and I thought, you know what?
[00:27:37.912 --> 00:27:43.495]  This is what I do at least once a day and when I religiously do it, things get a lot better around here.
[00:27:43.515 --> 00:27:45.857]  Nico, I really appreciate your help.
[00:27:46.577 --> 00:27:48.718]  I can't really... Someone ran off with it.
[00:27:48.758 --> 00:27:49.399]  It's probably me.
[00:27:49.439 --> 00:27:50.439]  I probably wandered off with it.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.920]  I probably wandered off with it.
[00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:52.981]  I don't need it.
[00:27:53.001 --> 00:27:53.361]  It's okay.
[00:27:53.381 --> 00:27:53.942]  I'll take it later.
[00:27:54.568 --> 00:27:56.308]  And that really is better under the tongue, not in water.
[00:27:56.348 --> 00:27:57.649]  But this is how I take it.
[00:27:58.509 --> 00:28:00.029]  Right into the old stomach.
[00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:02.750]  Right down the old gullet.
[00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:05.371]  With me droogies.
[00:28:06.211 --> 00:28:06.991]  And so there it is.
[00:28:07.011 --> 00:28:09.972]  Mmm.
[00:28:10.152 --> 00:28:10.792]  Tastes delicious.
[00:28:11.592 --> 00:28:13.373]  You know, when I first started drinking this stuff, it didn't taste good.
[00:28:13.393 --> 00:28:14.453]  But now my body loves it.
[00:28:15.572 --> 00:28:16.853]  It's not the first time you drink whiskey.
[00:28:16.873 --> 00:28:20.296]  You don't like it, but down the road, you know, it tastes like mama's milk.
[00:28:20.316 --> 00:28:25.180]  But even though you don't remember what mama's milk tastes like, you imagine it probably tastes like the Jamesons you're drinking.
[00:28:25.741 --> 00:28:28.883]  But instead of drinking Jamesons, I drank this.
[00:28:29.464 --> 00:28:33.087]  So again, it's available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:28:33.728 --> 00:28:34.188]  Thank you, sir.
[00:28:34.749 --> 00:28:37.471]  And your purchases do make the transmission possible.
[00:28:37.891 --> 00:28:41.614]  And we have been sold out of Secret 12 Medical Grade Methylcobalamin.
[00:28:42.395 --> 00:28:48.816]  But it has come back in, and I tell you, talk about energy, talk about stamina, this is the real energy drink.
[00:28:49.276 --> 00:28:58.198]  One or two squirts of that a day, and you will feel, I mean I certainly do, you can read the rave reviews, dramatic, dramatic effects with the Secret 12.
[00:28:58.718 --> 00:29:02.779]  So I mix those three things together, X2, Super Male, and the Methylcobalamin.
[00:29:03.059 --> 00:29:10.200]  During the winter, I put Winter Sun in, but actually Vitamin D and other systems, here it is,
[00:29:11.946 --> 00:29:13.388]  Should have gotten ready for this before I actually did it.
[00:29:13.408 --> 00:29:14.109]  It's down there as well.
[00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:16.351]  Are the building blocks of everything.
[00:29:16.392 --> 00:29:18.754]  And so much of the cheap stuff you find at the store is synthetic.
[00:29:19.335 --> 00:29:20.597]  Well, your body can't even absorb that.
[00:29:20.617 --> 00:29:21.738]  In many cases, it's toxic.
[00:29:22.239 --> 00:29:27.886]  You need the real, unheated, unpasteurized, raw,
[00:29:29.381 --> 00:29:29.721]  Stuff.
[00:29:30.381 --> 00:29:31.722]  And it will change your life.
[00:29:32.382 --> 00:29:33.783]  See, I have a big, giant pumpkin head.
[00:29:34.683 --> 00:29:37.364]  So it doesn't really look like... In fact, guys, find the photos.
[00:29:38.285 --> 00:29:40.246]  It doesn't really look like I've lost a ton of weight.
[00:29:40.266 --> 00:29:41.106]  You can see I've lost some.
[00:29:41.826 --> 00:29:45.007]  I took some photos where I showed myself five years ago versus now.
[00:29:45.088 --> 00:29:45.788]  It's night and day.
[00:29:46.128 --> 00:29:47.929]  From Jabba the Hutt to just a little bit overweight.
[00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:51.770]  But now, folks, with the shirt off, the six-pack's coming out.
[00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:56.912]  In fact, I just need to be vain, get in there and pull the shirt off, and show people the difference between three months ago.
[00:29:56.932 --> 00:29:58.093]  It is dramatic.
[00:29:59.485 --> 00:30:02.487]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.408 --> 00:30:06.210]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.233 --> 00:30:15.697]  We now know why StemExpress was so desperate to censor the undercover Planned Parenthood video featuring its CEO.
[00:30:16.097 --> 00:30:27.906]  The law prohibits organ and tissue donors from selling for profit, yet solicitation materials from StemExpress repeatedly tout how financially profitable and rewarding and beneficial it can be to the fiscal growth for abortion clinics.
[00:30:28.086 --> 00:30:35.173]  And when asked what they can do to help clinics that aren't profiting, the CEO is astonished and says she doesn't know any who aren't profiting.
[00:30:35.393 --> 00:30:36.814]  You want to say this is about women's health?
[00:30:37.055 --> 00:30:43.381]  She talks about the contamination of samples with staff due to unsanitary clinic conditions being a repeated problem.
[00:30:43.601 --> 00:30:48.546]  And the StemExpress CEO talks about the stigma of delivering butchered baby parts to labs.
[00:30:48.766 --> 00:30:50.167]  This is David Knight reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:31:10.183 --> 00:31:13.988]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[00:31:14.289 --> 00:31:24.603]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[00:31:24.763 --> 00:31:27.687]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[00:31:27.807 --> 00:31:36.575]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:31:36.615 --> 00:31:38.376]  This is the good halogen.
[00:31:38.476 --> 00:31:41.219]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[00:31:41.539 --> 00:31:53.330]  Now we at InfoWarsLife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure, 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.

[00:33:02.161 --> 00:33:02.381]  USA!
[00:33:02.401 --> 00:33:02.641]  USA!
[00:33:02.661 --> 00:33:02.942]  USA!
[00:33:02.982 --> 00:33:03.062]  USA!
[00:33:03.082 --> 00:33:03.342]  USA!
[00:33:19.995 --> 00:33:25.358]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[00:33:26.059 --> 00:33:30.542]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[00:33:31.062 --> 00:33:35.104]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[00:33:35.925 --> 00:33:37.206]  It's not about food.
[00:33:37.906 --> 00:33:40.488]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[00:33:47.156 --> 00:33:48.858]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:49.298 --> 00:33:52.301]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:33:53.402 --> 00:33:57.525]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday edition.
[00:33:58.806 --> 00:34:01.109]  The original prepper is really what I would call him.
[00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:03.351]  The original patriot.
[00:34:03.371 --> 00:34:07.915]  He's been around 25 years on air, but a decade before that.
[00:34:08.916 --> 00:34:10.877]  Steve Quayle will be joining us.
[00:34:12.486 --> 00:34:20.609]  Remember him talking about weaponized drones 15 years ago, and how they were going to be coming to our doorsteps with the police, and now that was in the news yesterday.
[00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:25.932]  And it just sounded so crazy even back then, but he has been quite the trailblazer.
[00:34:26.472 --> 00:34:27.292]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:34:27.372 --> 00:34:31.194]  Our reporters, David Knight and Joe Biggs, will be joining us.
[00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:40.454]  From the little town out in Virginia, where the media is preparing to destroy the Second Amendment, if they can.
[00:34:41.174 --> 00:34:49.179]  And there's really no mention that he's an Obama bot, wearing Obama pins, who thought black people were out to get him, white people were out to get him.
[00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:52.101]  And he was mad about the Charleston shooting.
[00:34:53.342 --> 00:34:54.443]  So he struck back.
[00:34:57.104 --> 00:34:57.525]  Simply.
[00:34:58.823 --> 00:35:01.206]  Sickening that this is going on.
[00:35:02.207 --> 00:35:14.639]  But maybe they sense that the race war push isn't working because Al Sharpton's having his weekday show canceled and moved to the weekends, which is where they kind of quietly shuffle people off.
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:19.044]  Piers Morgan is back demonizing the Second Amendment.
[00:35:19.064 --> 00:35:21.646]  This is a guy that has armed response security.
[00:35:22.546 --> 00:35:23.166]  At his L.A.
[00:35:23.527 --> 00:35:28.310]  house, mansion, he has armed security that is in the neighborhood.
[00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:32.612]  He has a sign in his yard that responds within one minute with guns.
[00:35:33.773 --> 00:35:37.675]  Why don't you just... I mean, I'd live in one of those neighborhoods if I had the money and lived out there, sure.
[00:35:37.936 --> 00:35:39.316]  Why not have armed security guards?
[00:35:39.577 --> 00:35:40.637]  But I'd have guns, too.
[00:35:41.578 --> 00:35:44.059]  I mean, I'm not knocking if you've got the money for armed security guards.
[00:35:44.239 --> 00:35:44.660]  Why not?
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.081]  Especially if you live in, you know, L.A.
[00:35:47.101 --> 00:35:49.483]  and there are robberies in those rich neighborhoods.
[00:35:50.287 --> 00:35:51.267]  I know folks that live out there.
[00:35:52.208 --> 00:35:56.189]  But just how do you sit there with a straight face saying the general public can't have guns?
[00:35:56.249 --> 00:36:07.194]  It's so fundamentally hypocritical when Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton or Michael Moore or Dianne Feinstein or Barbara Boxer or Michael Bloomberg or
[00:36:08.598 --> 00:36:20.307]  Nancy Pelosi, or any of these people, or Harry Reid, tries to restrict the general public's Second Amendment, and then they sit there with a straight face saying, nobody wants your guns, like it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:36:23.269 --> 00:36:27.552]  Now here's an article that we talked about a few weeks ago, but now I was actually mailed.
[00:36:28.913 --> 00:36:37.680]  The Inlander, their August 13th to 19th weekly edition, this is like the Austin Chronicle there,
[00:36:38.885 --> 00:36:40.366]  The big popular weekly tabloid.
[00:36:40.986 --> 00:36:46.428]  And it says, daring to tread with him standing on the Gadsden flags, meaning his constituents.
[00:36:47.588 --> 00:36:52.650]  And he says, the sheriff is scared of extremists and wants the public to be scared of them as well, and says they're a danger.
[00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:53.731]  Read the exact quote.
[00:36:54.231 --> 00:37:00.073]  Why Spokane's Republican sheriff says we should be scared of homegrown extremists and the fanatical fringe of the Tea Party.
[00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:08.993]  Now the reason I mention this article is it ties in with this story that Paul Watson's going to be talking about.
[00:37:09.593 --> 00:37:12.414]  Fort Bragg troops trained for domestic emergency.
[00:37:12.915 --> 00:37:20.658]  This exercise is about the home front during civil emergency ABC 11 North Carolina reports.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.781]  And reading from the report,
[00:37:28.007 --> 00:37:34.432]  Scenarios which could all be really coming to America and that's when the potential for martial law kicks in.
[00:37:34.452 --> 00:37:42.679]  You know, I have an ABC News report out of Louisiana where they go, martial law may be needed in America.
[00:37:43.699 --> 00:37:46.862]  And then it cuts to the very same photo that they have
[00:37:50.126 --> 00:38:02.189]  In that earlier report, in this one, showing Katrina and armored vehicles and troops riding around confiscating guns with the state police and others integrated in with regular army.
[00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:04.769]  I mean, this is what's being prepared for.
[00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:15.932]  And again, they create enough of an economic collapse and 100 million people that are on food assistance go hungry.
[00:38:15.952 --> 00:38:17.672]  You're going to see an explosion in this nation.
[00:38:18.908 --> 00:38:24.890]  It's going to make the Great Depression, if it goes this way, we're trying to stop it, look like a heavenly event.
[00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:26.510]  Look like a cakewalk.
[00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:27.951]  Look like green pastures.
[00:38:28.651 --> 00:38:29.871]  Look like a walk in the park.
[00:38:33.653 --> 00:38:35.073]  A piece of cake, whatever you want to call it.
[00:38:38.413 --> 00:38:46.198]  And there's this massive buildup in the Army Times and Stars and Stripes, just hundreds of articles about the military prepares to take on the Tea Party.
[00:38:46.739 --> 00:38:48.640]  Yes, the number one enemy on C-SPAN.
[00:38:49.281 --> 00:38:52.583]  Army War College generals, we're preparing to take on the gun owners.
[00:38:53.043 --> 00:38:58.147]  I mean, we have all this on video, and then we warn about it, and the media goes.
[00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:03.133]  You think martial law is coming in August and September?
[00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:04.836]  You believe the gun confiscation will be gone?
[00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:06.758]  You believe the governor will be arrested?
[00:39:07.279 --> 00:39:08.821]  You want to kill U.S.
[00:39:08.881 --> 00:39:09.982]  military, Mr. Jones?
[00:39:10.362 --> 00:39:12.425]  We're like, no, we're reading the Army Times.
[00:39:13.026 --> 00:39:17.692]  We're showing local news where they admit the martial law preparations, but push it as good.
[00:39:18.988 --> 00:39:31.956]  Just type into YouTube Clergy Response Teams and you'll get different newscasts around the country where it's the same federal script about during emergencies the clergy will work with the army to tell you to go ahead and turn the guns in and go to the emergency center with your family.
[00:39:31.976 --> 00:39:34.037]  And it cuts the preacher.
[00:39:34.377 --> 00:39:36.198]  It's of the Lord!
[00:39:36.238 --> 00:39:39.080]  Romans 13, do what you're told and go to the camp.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.661]  They actually say that.
[00:39:41.971 --> 00:39:43.191]  You've heard me play it at nauseam.
[00:39:43.952 --> 00:39:54.316]  I mean, it's like if I get up here and I say, I have CBS News across the country in the same script, they send federal scripts down through it, then you trust it because it's local, but it's a federal teleprompter.
[00:39:54.576 --> 00:39:55.636]  It's been loaded federally.
[00:39:57.257 --> 00:39:58.337]  So it might as well be national.
[00:39:59.618 --> 00:40:03.299]  And they're like, mercury helps your child's brain and is now a nutritious part of the food group.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.821]  And it helps your child's cognitive mind.
[00:40:08.032 --> 00:40:10.754]  Do I need to play that clip probably for the 300th time?
[00:40:10.774 --> 00:40:11.595]  I mean, I will.
[00:40:12.156 --> 00:40:15.539]  Mercury is good for your children.
[00:40:15.559 --> 00:40:16.379]  In fact, you know what?
[00:40:16.419 --> 00:40:17.060]  I'm not going to play it.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.001]  Just go to YouTube.
[00:40:18.041 --> 00:40:18.742]  We'll do it on screen.
[00:40:18.762 --> 00:40:20.843]  Type in, Mercury is good for you.
[00:40:21.464 --> 00:40:24.607]  And you can find different newscasts saying Mercury is good for you.
[00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.092]  And I remember when I saw
[00:40:31.752 --> 00:40:39.798]  The report, I knew it was nationally written, so I googled it years ago, and it was all over the country that day, but local newscasters going, Mercury is good!
[00:40:39.938 --> 00:40:40.759]  Mercury helps!
[00:40:40.879 --> 00:40:41.819]  Mercury is wonderful!
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:42.840]  Mercury!
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.321]  It's the new vitamin C!
[00:40:44.601 --> 00:40:45.842]  Be trendy today!
[00:40:46.003 --> 00:40:47.644]  You'll never talk again, but it's fun!
[00:40:47.904 --> 00:40:48.965]  Government loves you!
[00:40:48.985 --> 00:40:52.968]  I mean, this is the creepiness of this!
[00:40:53.808 --> 00:40:54.989]  Nobody wants your guns!
[00:40:55.329 --> 00:40:56.911]  Nobody's gonna take your doctor away!
[00:40:56.931 --> 00:40:58.832]  Obamacare is free!
[00:40:58.852 --> 00:40:59.913]  All lies!
[00:41:04.787 --> 00:41:07.568]  Hillary never had fake emails, now she admits she did.
[00:41:07.588 --> 00:41:11.631]  The head of the EPA had to step down over it, she needs to right now.
[00:41:13.992 --> 00:41:19.475]  So that's all coming up, but Paul Watson wrote an article that ties into this one, and we're going to him right now.
[00:41:20.956 --> 00:41:28.539]  France prepares for mass unrest, radicalized immigrants taking over cities, and this is in the French news.
[00:41:30.881 --> 00:41:32.762]  But then you ask, why are they bringing in
[00:41:34.042 --> 00:41:39.044]  To Europe, over 100,000 North Africans and Middle Easterners a month.
[00:41:39.584 --> 00:41:42.965]  That's a conservative... 100,000 a month.
[00:41:43.345 --> 00:41:48.687]  There's 100 plus thousand people out of North Africa on the island of Lesbos.
[00:41:48.987 --> 00:41:51.067]  I think it said 156,000.
[00:41:51.107 --> 00:41:51.968]  Two weeks ago I reported that.
[00:41:53.148 --> 00:41:54.529]  One little island's got 150,000 people on it.
[00:41:59.002 --> 00:42:03.644]  And in Germany, wherever, you just walk outside and there's just giant hordes of people.
[00:42:04.665 --> 00:42:06.485]  I was in Toronto last week.
[00:42:06.525 --> 00:42:08.526]  Beautiful city, blue skies, great weather.
[00:42:09.267 --> 00:42:10.347]  And I'm not kidding, folks.
[00:42:10.407 --> 00:42:13.189]  I've seen videos of street folks in Pakistan.
[00:42:14.429 --> 00:42:17.130]  I mean, you could tell these were malnourished children from very young age.
[00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:19.672]  You could tell the disorders when they haven't gotten enough food.
[00:42:20.252 --> 00:42:26.715]  And they're just absolutely the scariest looking people you'd see in a Pakistan market.
[00:42:27.554 --> 00:42:28.874]  There are a lot of great Pakistani people.
[00:42:28.894 --> 00:42:32.836]  I have friends that are Pakistani, wonderful, smart, scientific, you know, merchant folks, whatever.
[00:42:33.116 --> 00:42:39.778]  I mean, you talk about bad folks from a country, you can find some really bad people from a white area, a black area, you can find bad people in Mexico.
[00:42:39.818 --> 00:42:52.803]  I'm just saying, bottom of the barrel, and they were so shocking when I would see this, walking down the street, that I didn't even videotape the people.
[00:42:53.863 --> 00:42:56.804]  I just kind of, but I mean, I'm talking wild-eyed.
[00:42:57.783 --> 00:43:00.204]  And aggressively trying to sell you bottles of water or whatever.
[00:43:00.845 --> 00:43:08.708]  And it was just so shocking to know that just the world's collapsing and our governments are just disgorging this in.
[00:43:10.009 --> 00:43:14.351]  Along with Stinger missiles and AK-47s, that's what Paul's going to break down.
[00:43:16.532 --> 00:43:20.253]  And so when they strike, I mean, how many times did I say the Stinger missiles would end up in Europe?
[00:43:20.493 --> 00:43:21.474]  Probably France first.
[00:43:21.494 --> 00:43:22.994]  I'm going to start shooting down airliners.
[00:43:23.215 --> 00:43:24.135]  They say that's imminent.
[00:43:25.075 --> 00:43:26.276]  Our government again gave it to them.
[00:43:27.503 --> 00:43:36.207]  And our governments go in and destroy central governments there that are even working with the West to turn it over to the worst elements.
[00:43:41.649 --> 00:43:49.833]  But let me tell you, it just didn't mix seeing a bunch of folks that look like they came out of an Afghan bazaar, that look like they came out of the Middle Ages,
[00:43:52.162 --> 00:43:56.944]  Looking wild-eyed at women wearing mini skirts and stiletto heels.
[00:43:57.444 --> 00:44:02.907]  I mean, there were women out there on the street that looked like they were, you know, supermodels or something in Toronto.
[00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:13.171]  And right next to it, there'd be like people on rugs, smoking, you know, mini hookahs and yelling at people.
[00:44:13.631 --> 00:44:15.172]  I mean, it was just over the top.
[00:44:15.532 --> 00:44:17.893]  And that's what Europe is seeing and getting freaked out about.
[00:44:18.393 --> 00:44:19.894]  And Europe's got to pay for it.
[00:44:23.018 --> 00:44:28.703]  And all I'm saying is, suddenly it isn't just immigration or the best people coming here, it's Space Bar, folks.
[00:44:31.485 --> 00:44:44.276]  I mean, I've been down on the hike and bike trail and seen homeless Guatemalans catching fish with a piece of monofilament line wrapped around a Coke can that they use as the... And I'm sure they're really sweet, great, nice people.
[00:44:44.677 --> 00:44:50.422]  The question is, what is the government doing here and everywhere else just opening everything up?
[00:44:51.633 --> 00:44:54.914]  And by the way, those immigrants don't even know how to go get the assistance.
[00:44:55.255 --> 00:45:01.457]  They haven't made it to the Democratic Party facility yet, and haven't been scooped up to actually be taken off the street.
[00:45:01.697 --> 00:45:02.998]  They're living in the Greenbelt.
[00:45:03.578 --> 00:45:09.381]  It was grandma, dad, granted he must have died, it was mama, it was daddy, and three kids.
[00:45:11.667 --> 00:45:15.848]  With a fire going over across the creek, catching fish and eating them.
[00:45:15.908 --> 00:45:17.709]  I mean, we're talking Grizzly Adams!
[00:45:18.229 --> 00:45:18.869]  Okay, fine.
[00:45:19.509 --> 00:45:21.630]  These are countries that live like Grizzly Adams.
[00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:23.190]  We're in the 21st century.
[00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:26.611]  Why are they bringing Grizzly Adams in, en masse?
[00:45:27.191 --> 00:45:28.131]  What's the reason?
[00:45:29.092 --> 00:45:33.353]  Because when it all unravels and melts down into depression, it is going to be a you-know-what storm.
[00:45:34.457 --> 00:45:39.820]  And they're mixing radical jihadists into this, and they're going to use the attacks to take everybody's liberties.
[00:45:40.141 --> 00:45:43.823]  And there won't be any logic of, our government opened the borders, our government gave them the weapons.
[00:45:44.764 --> 00:45:46.805]  Because the public doesn't have logic anymore.
[00:45:48.226 --> 00:45:50.747]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us from London to break this down.
[00:45:51.128 --> 00:45:54.490]  France prepares for mass unrest, radicalized immigrants taking over cities.
[00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:57.552]  That is a huge headline, and you go through what the military says,
[00:45:58.953 --> 00:46:00.054]  They think this is imminent.
[00:46:00.074 --> 00:46:14.721]  I mean, for those that don't know, a lot of French cities are more than half Islamic now, and the radical Islamists are bullying the non-radical Islamists, like they've done in Libya, Syria, Egypt, and other places, in a submission poll.
[00:46:15.221 --> 00:46:18.863]  And so, Islam itself is being radicalized.
[00:46:18.983 --> 00:46:21.264]  Why is the West rolling a red carpet out to this?
[00:46:22.739 --> 00:46:32.869]  Well, I think one of the main reasons, Alex, is that their values are completely incompatible with, quote, you know, Western liberal democratic values, especially when it comes to free speech.
[00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:41.538]  I posted an image earlier this week on Monday, I think it was, of an ISIS flag on a toilet roll.
[00:46:41.978 --> 00:46:44.301]  OK, this is an image that's been out everywhere.
[00:46:44.901 --> 00:46:48.383]  Originally, Facebook banned it, said it was offensive to Muslims.
[00:46:48.423 --> 00:46:50.545]  They later backed down, restored the image.
[00:46:51.045 --> 00:46:54.147]  So I posted this image and said, look, this is being censored.
[00:46:54.287 --> 00:46:55.828]  Everybody should post this image.
[00:46:56.288 --> 00:46:59.910]  So it got 360,000 shares on Facebook.
[00:47:00.331 --> 00:47:01.832]  And ever since it was posted,
[00:47:02.757 --> 00:47:12.659]  Literally every day, death threat after death threat after death threat of people saying insulting someone's religion isn't covered by free speech.
[00:47:12.799 --> 00:47:13.400]  Well, it is.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:14.860]  That's what free speech is all about.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.180]  That's right.
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:21.522]  The radical Islamists are going to join with the left to selectively ban free speech of libertarians, Christians and conservatives.
[00:47:21.762 --> 00:47:22.902]  That's their sick alliance.
[00:47:24.107 --> 00:47:31.216]  Yeah, so it's like, you don't have the free speech to criticise our religion, but we have the free speech to make death threats against you for doing that.
[00:47:31.656 --> 00:47:33.138]  Quite the topsy-turvy world.
[00:47:33.539 --> 00:47:35.361]  So it's been an interesting week.
[00:47:35.942 --> 00:47:41.509]  And yeah, then we've got this story out of France, which is an intelligent source who spoke to The Telegraph.
[00:47:41.929 --> 00:47:54.440]  Who basically said that the French Army is preparing for mass unrest that will arise out of these immigrant populations obtaining weapons from Libya, given to Libyan Jihadist rebels.
[00:47:58.443 --> 00:47:59.905]  We just lost Paul's audio.
[00:47:59.965 --> 00:48:01.906]  Entire neighborhoods in France.
[00:48:03.628 --> 00:48:05.570]  Continue Paul, you cut out for a moment, repeat that.
[00:48:07.042 --> 00:48:12.185]  Yeah, so they're going to get these weapons from Libya, given to the jihadists by the French government in the first place.
[00:48:12.645 --> 00:48:17.888]  These immigrants, fourth generation, already, you know, disenfranchised.
[00:48:18.189 --> 00:48:29.555]  They're saying they're going to get control of these weapons, take over entire neighborhoods in France, and that then they're going to have to send the army in to reclaim this territory in major cities.
[00:48:30.116 --> 00:48:35.519]  And don't forget that just last week, we had this attack, this attempted attack on a train in France.
[00:48:36.553 --> 00:48:42.616]  Whereby this guy obtains a Kalashnikov from where he visited Syria, no doubt that has a connection to it.
[00:48:43.296 --> 00:48:45.618]  Obviously the three individuals bravely tackle him.
[00:48:46.078 --> 00:48:55.403]  But then the lawyer comes out for this terrorist and says, he's not a terrorist, he just got the AK-47 because he was hungry and he wanted to get food off people.
[00:48:56.083 --> 00:48:58.584]  And don't call him a terrorist, that's Islamophobic.
[00:48:58.864 --> 00:49:01.966]  You know, Muslim guy walking around a train carriage with an AK-47.
[00:49:02.006 --> 00:49:05.728]  Cutting people in box cutters and shooting at people, he's a little cupcake.
[00:49:06.788 --> 00:49:11.129]  Yeah, 270 rounds, but don't call him a terrorist, that's Islamophobic.
[00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:16.010]  So you've got this cultural war basically going on in all these European countries.
[00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:20.351]  Sweden as well, which we can get onto, which is even worse than France.
[00:49:20.911 --> 00:49:29.033]  But in France, they did a poll last year, found that 15% of French citizens support ISIS.
[00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:36.024]  27% of French citizens aged 18 to 25 support ISIS.
[00:49:36.324 --> 00:49:40.827]  And of course the vast majority of these figures are coming from these immigrant areas.
[00:49:41.228 --> 00:49:51.334]  Doesn't mean they're going to go out and behead people, but again it shows that their values are completely incompatible with the values of free speech, with the values of liberal Western democracy.
[00:49:51.354 --> 00:49:59.360]  But the controlled left hates Western culture so much that they're willing to use radical Islam as the sword to behead
[00:50:00.521 --> 00:50:01.043]  The West.
[00:50:01.103 --> 00:50:06.195]  I mean, this is the execution of Western culture by any means necessary by the New World Order.
[00:50:07.622 --> 00:50:10.283]  Yeah, and now they're even getting into positions of power.
[00:50:10.443 --> 00:50:14.926]  Sweden, one of their top immigration officials, is an ISIS sympathizer.
[00:50:15.266 --> 00:50:19.188]  She praises jihadists fighting in Syria on her Facebook page.
[00:50:19.508 --> 00:50:21.349]  She likes ISIS propaganda.
[00:50:21.869 --> 00:50:24.691]  She's in control of the immigration system in Sweden.
[00:50:25.031 --> 00:50:28.373]  People who speak out against it are charged with hate crimes.
[00:50:28.393 --> 00:50:31.775]  By the way, they even pose on their Facebooks in their jihad outfits.
[00:50:32.735 --> 00:50:34.377]  Some have even traveled to be with him.
[00:50:34.738 --> 00:50:38.383]  They even let people in and then they're just praised as liberal.
[00:50:39.394 --> 00:50:47.918]  Well, the taxpayer-funded expert on Islamophobia in Sweden, Nikolai Skrammo, he went on to join ISIS.
[00:50:48.218 --> 00:50:50.859]  He was the government expert on preventing Islamophobia.
[00:50:50.879 --> 00:50:54.221]  Yeah, I mean, I'm here to say all authoritarians can go to hell.
[00:50:54.341 --> 00:50:55.442]  I mean, I'm done with this.
[00:50:56.002 --> 00:50:57.503]  And that's what I mean about the left.
[00:50:57.603 --> 00:50:59.944]  They are a weird, mentally ill group.
[00:51:00.604 --> 00:51:07.747]  I mean, they'll say that you and I wearing pants is sexist, but if people want to sexually mutilate women and blow up Buddhist temples, it's okay.
[00:51:07.847 --> 00:51:08.628]  I mean, no, it's not.
[00:51:10.566 --> 00:51:12.386]  Healthy, organic, fresh fish.
[00:51:12.606 --> 00:51:14.527]  Robust, mouth-watering vegetables.

[00:54:34.023 --> 00:54:39.526]  Newsweek's reporting that a suspect is in custody after an active shooting incident reported at Mississippi State University.
[00:54:40.006 --> 00:54:43.848]  Right now it appears like it's really nothing and that no one's been hurt, hopefully.
[00:54:45.308 --> 00:54:49.250]  We also see a lot of hysteria where there's a backfire outside the Capitol, so they evacuated.
[00:54:50.391 --> 00:54:52.752]  But we'll continue to track this as it unfolds.
[00:54:53.872 --> 00:54:55.073]  Maybe serious, may not be.
[00:54:55.113 --> 00:54:57.154]  Going back to Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:54:58.629 --> 00:54:59.509]  Paul, it's very clear.
[00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:03.972]  They take Western values of having open, laissez-faire culture.
[00:55:05.192 --> 00:55:10.975]  They then expand that and tell the West, submit to everything, let us do whatever we want to you politically.
[00:55:11.695 --> 00:55:17.638]  Then they bring in groups that are basically neolithic when it comes to the policies.
[00:55:18.559 --> 00:55:19.299]  Very primitive.
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:22.361]  And they then make an alliance
[00:55:23.618 --> 00:55:33.322]  With the radicals of that group, a billion, three hundred million Muslims, to take over regular Islam, because I mean, most Muslims just want to have businesses and live and are pretty conservative, good people.
[00:55:33.842 --> 00:55:41.845]  I don't believe in Islamophobia where there's just all a bunch of bad people, but the group getting in charge, Saudi Arabia and the Wahhabists, are really horrible people.
[00:55:42.085 --> 00:55:43.206]  I mean, they're about as bad as it gets.
[00:55:43.226 --> 00:55:43.706]  They're scum.
[00:55:44.186 --> 00:55:47.227]  And they're always raping kids and women and running snuff rings.
[00:55:47.748 --> 00:55:49.869]  They talk about it because they can do it, because it's infidels.
[00:55:49.929 --> 00:55:53.210]  I mean, they're just... They make Charlie Manson look like a cupcake.
[00:55:54.554 --> 00:55:56.075]  And they're just out of control.
[00:55:57.497 --> 00:55:59.899]  And our governments are traitorous bringing them in.
[00:56:00.519 --> 00:56:01.540]  What's the endgame?
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:05.584]  I mean, I used to think they were just going to use them for a clash of civilizations to take our liberties.
[00:56:06.084 --> 00:56:08.106]  But I think they've looked at the population demographics.
[00:56:08.246 --> 00:56:15.032]  I think, I think they've decided to join with it in the next generation and actually end Western culture as we know it, Paul.
[00:56:16.714 --> 00:56:18.355]  Yeah, it's definitely about that.
[00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:19.936]  It's about diluting culture.
[00:56:19.976 --> 00:56:21.498]  It's about taking away liberties.
[00:56:22.114 --> 00:56:32.718]  And, you know, it just came out in the UK, 330,000 immigrants per year, per year, coming into the UK, a tiny island of just over 60 million population.
[00:56:33.139 --> 00:56:38.701]  And as you were just talking about, it came out, Tony Blair's government, that was their secret plan, it got leaked.
[00:56:39.741 --> 00:56:46.426]  To allow all these immigrants to come in, to use them as a voting block, to use them to dilute, basically, the whole culture.
[00:56:46.726 --> 00:56:47.787]  And to put them in charge.
[00:56:47.807 --> 00:56:48.728]  And create this organization.
[00:56:48.948 --> 00:56:57.615]  I've had members of your parliament on that are liberal and they admit, well I heard conservatives say it, didn't believe it, but they're actually putting them in charge of the social services, the police, you name it.
[00:56:58.535 --> 00:57:03.079]  The government's bringing in a foreign, illegal, alien group to be their Praetorian guard.
[00:57:04.704 --> 00:57:14.227]  Yeah, and while arresting people like Tommy Robinson for considering to attend a meeting about a Drama Hamid cartoon contest.
[00:57:14.547 --> 00:57:21.030]  There's literally snatching people off the street for thought crime because they may be planning to offend.
[00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:23.531]  And banned Michael Savage from coming.
[00:57:24.311 --> 00:57:26.952]  And then banned a martial arts expert from coming in.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:30.942]  Yeah, and Sweden's even worse, though.
[00:57:30.962 --> 00:57:32.303]  I keep harping on about Sweden.
[00:57:32.683 --> 00:57:38.407]  Okay, since they opened their borders in the 70s, 1400% rise in rapes.
[00:57:38.888 --> 00:57:43.951]  Feminist liberals bang on about this rape culture in the West, which is completely contrived and invented.
[00:57:44.332 --> 00:57:56.601]  While Sweden goes through this 1400% surge in rapes, you go through the arrest records, about 75% of them are foreign-born immigrants, the perpetrators of these rapes.
[00:57:56.681 --> 00:57:58.102]  And they say it's cultural!
[00:57:58.522 --> 00:58:00.511]  In their countries to rape women, so it's okay!
[00:58:01.513 --> 00:58:06.336]  Yeah, that's just their culture, I guess we're Islamophobic for being against the raping of women now.
[00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:07.978]  We're not trendy, we're not liberal.
[00:58:08.478 --> 00:58:12.060]  So, they went a step further and said, that's not trendy enough.
[00:58:12.461 --> 00:58:21.727]  Now some of the politicians in Sweden are saying, the returning ISIS jihadists, we need to give them jobs, give them welfare, and make the taxpayers pay for it.
[00:58:22.027 --> 00:58:29.593]  They're even talking about forcing Swedes to give up their garages to house these immigrants, because there's a massive housing shortage.
[00:58:29.633 --> 00:58:30.053]  Yeah, oh yeah!
[00:58:30.393 --> 00:58:33.915]  Forcing you to quarter the jihadis in your house.
[00:58:34.215 --> 00:58:40.178]  I mean, this... The left is mentally ill and wants to take over and wants to crap all over everything.
[00:58:40.218 --> 00:58:41.879]  I mean, I hate to use a term like that, but that's it.
[00:58:41.899 --> 00:58:45.900]  I mean, it's like somebody that's got dementia rubbing stuff all over their body.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:48.422]  I mean, that's what they... The left has dementia.
[00:58:48.682 --> 00:58:54.645]  They're fascist, mentally ill scum who hate progress, hate freedom, hate wealth.
[00:58:55.705 --> 00:58:56.425]  They hate strength.
[00:58:56.966 --> 00:58:58.907]  I want to talk more about the military plan.
[00:58:58.947 --> 00:58:59.327]  Stay there, Paul.
[00:59:00.174 --> 00:59:01.395]  Another major health threat.
[00:59:01.435 --> 00:59:06.337]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:59:06.417 --> 00:59:09.038]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:59:09.078 --> 00:59:15.860]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:59:16.121 --> 00:59:18.982]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:22.063]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:59:22.143 --> 00:59:24.064]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:59:24.104 --> 00:59:26.905]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:59:27.005 --> 00:59:32.527]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:59:32.727 --> 00:59:36.208]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:59:36.228 --> 00:59:39.229]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:59:39.329 --> 00:59:46.431]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:59:56.935 --> 00:59:57.977]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:16.311 --> 01:00:20.496]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:21.156 --> 01:00:21.957]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.738 --> 01:00:23.619]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.924]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.484 --> 01:00:32.549]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:49.235 --> 01:00:50.516]  Paul Watson's our guest.
[01:00:50.596 --> 01:00:56.741]  Our reporters will join us from Virginia, the little town where the tragic shooting happened yesterday.
[01:00:56.821 --> 01:00:58.963]  Coming up in the next segment when Steve Quayle joins us.
[01:00:59.483 --> 01:01:01.705]  We'll also have open phones with Steve Quayle's with us.
[01:01:02.506 --> 01:01:02.766]  Paul.
[01:01:04.457 --> 01:01:13.480]  Clearly, though, the very neocons and rhino-republicans pushing Islamophobia, just of Muslims in general, so we've got to invade their countries.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.541]  They go over, destabilize the countries, then put the jihadis in.
[01:01:17.941 --> 01:01:19.422]  That's the super double-cross.
[01:01:20.982 --> 01:01:23.163]  It's so dastardly, it makes the head spin.
[01:01:24.363 --> 01:01:33.866]  And geopolitically, clearly now they're gearing up for these groups to be given the green light, through their leadership, to start soft-target attacks.
[01:01:35.572 --> 01:01:46.813]  Does the establishment really think the West will put up with continued rape, continued murder, and jihad attacks, and then not call it Islamic?
[01:01:46.853 --> 01:01:48.035]  I mean, how are they going to get away with this?
[01:01:50.051 --> 01:01:53.212]  Well, they've rebranded authoritarianism.
[01:01:53.252 --> 01:01:58.095]  So now you see in countries like Germany, the host population are attacking the immigrants.
[01:01:58.135 --> 01:01:59.215]  This is where it's going to go.
[01:01:59.755 --> 01:02:02.797]  And the same thing's happening with this whole Black Lives Matter thing.
[01:02:03.277 --> 01:02:06.378]  Okay, we had the attack yesterday, which was a revenge for Charleston.
[01:02:06.659 --> 01:02:08.639]  It's all part of this contrived race war.
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:12.781]  But most people don't know, and I'm going to write an article on this.
[01:02:12.801 --> 01:02:14.222]  This is basically an exclusive.
[01:02:14.242 --> 01:02:16.003]  This hasn't been pointed out by anyone.
[01:02:16.563 --> 01:02:34.136]  Okay, most members of Black Lives Matter are just useful idiots, they're not dangerous, but if you look at the three founders of Black Lives Matter, who are three militant lesbian feminists, they cite as their inspiration and in their foundational text for Black Lives Matter,
[01:02:34.696 --> 01:02:36.958]  This woman called Assata Shakur.
[01:02:37.519 --> 01:02:42.164]  She is on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list.
[01:02:42.524 --> 01:02:50.292]  This is a convicted cop killer who escaped to Cuba back in the 70s with the help of the weather underground.
[01:02:50.572 --> 01:02:55.818]  She killed police officers and this is the woman cited as the inspiration behind
[01:02:56.138 --> 01:03:01.102]  And then it's the left constantly saying that libertarians, constitutionalists are going to kill cops.
[01:03:01.483 --> 01:03:05.065]  Well, only if they follow orders to come confiscate all the guns and have martial law.
[01:03:05.506 --> 01:03:08.208]  I mean, it's not libertarians and patriots that hate police.
[01:03:09.389 --> 01:03:11.170]  It is historically the communist left.
[01:03:11.211 --> 01:03:23.040]  And again, the left-right paradigm is false because globalists control the whole thing, but they're taking over worldwide using leftist ideologies and groups allied with super fascist radical Islam.
[01:03:23.381 --> 01:03:24.802]  What a sickening combo.
[01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:30.194]  Yeah, and remember the Obama administration has met with these Black Lives Matter leaders.
[01:03:30.634 --> 01:03:37.281]  This idol, this icon that they worship, Assata Shakur, she left the Black Panthers because it wasn't violent enough.
[01:03:37.581 --> 01:03:43.026]  She joined the Black Liberation Army, which killed 13 cops in the 70s.
[01:03:43.326 --> 01:03:45.128]  This is the foundational inspiration.
[01:03:45.408 --> 01:03:46.870]  They say it's about black liberation.
[01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:49.893]  And that's why they're obsessed with killing cops now, and Soros is funding it.
[01:03:50.899 --> 01:03:52.560]  Yeah, Soros is funding the whole thing.
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.161]  They're now trying to say, oh, that's debunked.
[01:03:54.181 --> 01:03:57.023]  Meanwhile, this sheriff says that we want to kill cops, basically.
[01:03:57.964 --> 01:04:03.828]  Yeah, well, it's all, you know, the dangerous right-wing conservatives, the Tea Party, never being involved in any act of violence.
[01:04:04.288 --> 01:04:06.990]  And these people are literally chanting, what do we want?
[01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:07.750]  Dead cops.
[01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:08.511]  When do we want it?
[01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:08.851]  Now.
[01:04:09.271 --> 01:04:14.615]  The NYPD cop killer, Ishmael Brinsley, said that was a revenge attack for Black Lives Matter.
[01:04:14.955 --> 01:04:16.416]  Now we have the incident yesterday.
[01:04:16.797 --> 01:04:21.161]  This in turn creates more Dillon roofs, and the whole cycle goes round and round.
[01:04:21.481 --> 01:04:24.284]  Then the government comes in with the control, with the new powers.
[01:04:24.624 --> 01:04:29.048]  That's why it's in their interest to fuel the flames of this race war.
[01:04:30.089 --> 01:04:33.673]  To distract us from the fact that foreign banks are looting everything right now, Paul.
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.622]  Yeah, it's a massive distraction, again, to get us fighting with each other.
[01:04:39.022 --> 01:04:49.649]  And the very leaders, the de facto leader of Black Lives Matter came out within minutes of the news breaking of yesterday's shooting, before the identity of the shooter was even known, blamed it on white people.
[01:04:50.029 --> 01:04:59.075]  Time Magazine, in defense of rioting, you know, salons... That's right, you should know a story on how Time Magazine called for killing people and is responsible.
[01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:02.597]  Because more than anything, they are now, and it's important to point out that
[01:05:03.772 --> 01:05:04.653]  It's incredible, Paul.
[01:05:04.713 --> 01:05:05.613]  It's totally sick.
[01:05:05.673 --> 01:05:06.213]  Great job.
[01:05:06.573 --> 01:05:07.374]  Infowars.com.
[01:05:07.414 --> 01:05:09.135]  We'll be back with our reporters.
[01:05:10.135 --> 01:05:15.798]  Since yesterday's early morning Virginia news shooting, we now know more about the shooter Vester Lee Flanagan.
[01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:21.241]  He exasperated his bosses with his stiff and nervous delivery and by his inability to use a teleprompter.
[01:05:21.381 --> 01:05:25.403]  He was also reprimanded for wearing a President Obama badge during an election report.
[01:05:25.523 --> 01:05:31.604]  In the report, his supervisor writes, this is a clear violation not only of Schertz County policy, but of standard journalistic ethics.
[01:05:31.884 --> 01:05:36.225]  Journalists, and particularly reporters who appear on television, must abide by a different standard.
[01:05:36.425 --> 01:05:39.726]  President Obama responded saying guns are worse than terrorism.
[01:05:40.046 --> 01:05:46.627]  What we know is that the number of people who die from gun-related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism, the president added.
[01:05:46.767 --> 01:05:54.009]  Trump responded by saying, the problem is not guns, it's mental illness, which echoes the infamous appearance Alex Jones made on the Piers Morgan Show.
[01:05:54.269 --> 01:05:54.970]  How about Prozac?
[01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:57.532]  You know the number one... Oh, that's the big sponsor, isn't it?
[01:05:57.552 --> 01:05:59.073]  Don't want to talk about the U.S.
[01:05:59.153 --> 01:06:04.697]  number one cause of death is suicide now because they give people suicide mass murder pills!
[01:06:04.917 --> 01:06:07.579]  Check out the video reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:06:07.759 --> 01:06:09.561]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com
[01:06:10.041 --> 01:06:15.043]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[01:06:26.068 --> 01:06:29.389]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[01:06:40.953 --> 01:06:43.054]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:06:43.174 --> 01:06:47.895]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:06:48.156 --> 01:06:51.297]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:06:51.437 --> 01:06:54.638]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:06:54.918 --> 01:06:56.738]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:06:56.898 --> 01:06:58.779]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:06:58.999 --> 01:07:00.919]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[01:07:09.742 --> 01:07:13.546]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[01:07:13.846 --> 01:07:24.157]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[01:07:24.297 --> 01:07:27.220]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:36.131]  We've been able to secure a limited supply of the pure deep earth crystals and have now been able to produce more survival shield nascent iodine X2.
[01:07:36.171 --> 01:07:37.933]  This is the good halogen.
[01:07:38.033 --> 01:07:40.757]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[01:07:41.097 --> 01:07:42.820]  Now we at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:52.863]  Are bringing you the only source of clean, pure 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:07:53.083 --> 01:07:56.044]  Watch the informational videos at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:56.164 --> 01:08:00.805]  Discover how transformational pure iodine can be for you and your family.
[01:08:01.005 --> 01:08:01.905]  Folks, this isn't hype.
[01:08:02.065 --> 01:08:05.166]  Read the reviews for yourself at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:08:11.772 --> 01:08:16.797]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:17.198 --> 01:08:19.480]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:34.053 --> 01:08:36.358]  Alex Jones here back live into the second hour.
[01:08:36.458 --> 01:08:42.511]  Our reporters Joe Biggs and of course David Knight are reporting live from the site of yesterday's tragic shooting.
[01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:48.165]  WDBJ in Minetta, Virginia.
[01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:56.972]  And former Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs is there first up to tell us what happened since they got in last night, what's happening with the press conferences.
[01:08:57.513 --> 01:08:59.455]  They're going to be covering the media response to this.
[01:08:59.495 --> 01:09:01.016]  Hillary calling for more gun control.
[01:09:01.817 --> 01:09:04.119]  The father of the news reporter calling for that.
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.722]  Simply ridiculous.
[01:09:07.062 --> 01:09:12.909]  Very, very sad that this is now being used to try to disarm other innocent people that have nothing to do with this.
[01:09:13.009 --> 01:09:17.294]  But giving us the latest from the ground is Joe Biggs.
[01:09:17.394 --> 01:09:17.635]  Joe?
[01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:20.271]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:09:20.291 --> 01:09:23.334]  Now I'm standing right across the street from the Beardwater Plaza.
[01:09:23.655 --> 01:09:31.184]  Now over to my left, over here we'll pan across, this is the actual location where Flanagan came in and shot the two journalists.
[01:09:31.264 --> 01:09:34.187]  We still have another person critically injured in the hospital.
[01:09:34.427 --> 01:09:37.571]  Now today at five o'clock our time here on East Coast Standard Time,
[01:09:37.871 --> 01:09:41.736]  We're going to have a press conference right over here across the street.
[01:09:41.756 --> 01:09:46.062]  They're going to actually bring us over and let us walk around, talk, ask questions.
[01:09:46.563 --> 01:09:50.127]  And I've got a few questions I'm going to ask too as well, so we're prepared for that.
[01:09:50.468 --> 01:09:56.095]  But one of the things that we know today is they found the LGBT flag in Flanagan's apartment.
[01:09:56.511 --> 01:10:03.338]  So what this means is, since he has the flag, that means he represents all gay, lesbian people.
[01:10:03.698 --> 01:10:05.720]  So I think he speaks for them all.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:06.761]  It's a hate flag now.
[01:10:07.061 --> 01:10:11.566]  I think we should call for a full-out ban on that flag, just like they did in Charleston, Alex.
[01:10:11.906 --> 01:10:16.469]  I agree, because the Confederate battle flag, Robert E. Lee flag, was there.
[01:10:16.509 --> 01:10:21.212]  Historically it has nothing to do with oppressing black people, even though they say it does.
[01:10:22.393 --> 01:10:26.755]  Let's ban the rainbow flag now, and let's ban the Confederate flag.
[01:10:27.176 --> 01:10:31.198]  And then if somebody's wearing a Coca-Cola shirt when they kill somebody, I want Coca-Cola banned.
[01:10:31.679 --> 01:10:35.701]  And if somebody runs over somebody in a Ford F-150 on purpose, ban Ford.
[01:10:36.221 --> 01:10:37.602]  Because it is the fault of Ford.
[01:10:37.622 --> 01:10:38.343]  That's a great idea.
[01:10:39.181 --> 01:10:42.066]  I mean, since he is a black homosexual, or he was.
[01:10:42.086 --> 01:10:50.201]  Alright, our Skype has now broken up, but we will go back.
[01:10:50.221 --> 01:10:51.424]  Okay, Joe, go ahead and finish your point.
[01:10:53.072 --> 01:10:53.452]  Check, check.
[01:10:54.093 --> 01:10:54.413]  You're back.
[01:10:54.453 --> 01:10:54.693]  Go ahead.
[01:10:54.713 --> 01:10:55.393]  Alright.
[01:10:55.813 --> 01:11:10.941]  I said, well, since he was a, uh, you know, an African American homosexual, I think we should hold everybody responsible for this because his one, his lone actions represent everyone across the full spectrum of the LGBT community and the black community.
[01:11:11.741 --> 01:11:14.022]  You know, there's going to be a lot of pay now for this.
[01:11:14.082 --> 01:11:15.022]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:11:15.382 --> 01:11:17.042]  You know, everyone's talking about a gun.
[01:11:17.263 --> 01:11:20.203]  You've got the Clinton people coming out saying we need to ban the guns.
[01:11:20.223 --> 01:11:30.486]  You've got the governor here in Virginia saying they need stricter gun background checks, when in fact we know now that Flanagan went through the proper procedures, got the gun two days after the Charleston shooting.
[01:11:30.706 --> 01:11:31.767]  This was premeditated.
[01:11:31.967 --> 01:11:33.307]  This guy went through the background
[01:11:34.448 --> 01:11:36.028]  So we don't need to call for more background checks.
[01:11:36.048 --> 01:11:36.849]  They're already in place.
[01:11:37.169 --> 01:11:40.311]  This was a lone man, one guy, who was pushed over the edge.
[01:11:40.591 --> 01:11:41.952]  He was mentally unstable.
[01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:48.115]  He didn't know how to react to these so-called rumors from these reporters saying that they made racist comments.
[01:11:48.475 --> 01:11:56.099]  And instead of doing like most people do, anyone in their lifetime has come across some kind of racist comment they've heard of.
[01:11:56.399 --> 01:11:57.000]  You know what you do?
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:59.301]  You do like I've done before and other of my friends have done.
[01:11:59.541 --> 01:12:00.722]  You brush it off and move on.
[01:12:01.042 --> 01:12:03.023]  Instead, this guy decided to cross the line
[01:12:03.263 --> 01:12:05.004]  That's right, but expanding on that while your Skype breaks up, Joe Beggs...
[01:12:20.071 --> 01:12:21.111]  It's very, very simple.
[01:12:21.832 --> 01:12:27.074]  This is what totalitarianism does, is it blames whole groups of people for the actions of one person.
[01:12:27.494 --> 01:12:34.737]  And as soon as we learned this guy was black, we didn't start blaming all black people for it like a lot of black groups did and the left did.
[01:12:35.177 --> 01:12:38.379]  This is their guilt-based mindset.
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:48.208]  And we had the guy, because of the Southern Poverty Law Center, he admitted it, go in and shoot up Dr. Dobson's facility, focus on the family.
[01:12:48.769 --> 01:12:58.377]  The truth is, the left is very, very violent, and they are pushing with Time Magazine saying the case for rioting and Black Lives Matter groups calling for violence.
[01:12:58.778 --> 01:13:02.842]  The truth is, though, as a group, they've been pushing violence.
[01:13:03.422 --> 01:13:04.543]  And that's the problem.
[01:13:04.583 --> 01:13:12.311]  And I really wonder, when Nancy Pelosi is in control of the DC-based Black Lives Matter with her staffer, why would they be pushing this?
[01:13:12.691 --> 01:13:14.072]  What do they think they're going to get out of it?
[01:13:16.655 --> 01:13:17.376]  Well, I don't get it.
[01:13:17.516 --> 01:13:21.600]  I confronted DeRay McKesson, the guy that's the so-called head of the Black Lives Matter.
[01:13:22.182 --> 01:13:22.542]  We're good.
[01:13:46.698 --> 01:13:49.399]  And somehow that's going to defeat the racism against them.
[01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:50.660]  All they're doing is creating more.
[01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:52.000]  It's out of control.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.561]  Well that makes business better for them.
[01:13:54.922 --> 01:13:57.603]  Now I want to talk about what you've witnessed since you got there.
[01:13:57.663 --> 01:14:02.345]  Then we're going to switch here in a minute and get David Knight's breakdown on what's happening.
[01:14:02.625 --> 01:14:04.686]  And then tell us what's coming up as well.
[01:14:06.069 --> 01:14:09.914]  Well, what we've seen so far is you have the whole area has been blockaded off.
[01:14:09.934 --> 01:14:11.235]  There's police up and down the road.
[01:14:11.516 --> 01:14:18.344]  They're not letting anybody over in that area right now, except for essential people who are working in some of the smaller businesses over here.
[01:14:18.384 --> 01:14:21.168]  This is a really small little lake town, nice area.
[01:14:21.873 --> 01:14:22.474]  I don't think so.
[01:14:39.207 --> 01:14:39.987]  And that's the thing.
[01:14:40.027 --> 01:14:40.687]  That's what I want to do.
[01:14:40.727 --> 01:14:45.329]  Later on, there's going to be a press conference and I'm going to ask if that gun has been charged with murder.
[01:14:45.729 --> 01:14:47.749]  Because, I mean, really, that's what it is.
[01:14:47.769 --> 01:14:48.629]  We're blaming the guns.
[01:14:48.649 --> 01:14:50.830]  We're not going to blame the individual.
[01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:53.151]  I think the gun should be charged with first-degree murder.
[01:14:53.471 --> 01:14:58.512]  In fact, it also pressured and brainwashed the shooter into doing it.
[01:14:59.685 --> 01:15:12.212]  Well, I want to talk to these mainstream reporters, too, when they're live, once we go live, and tell them how dare them and shame on them for taking this senseless act of violence by one person and using it to push their anti-gun agenda.
[01:15:12.492 --> 01:15:13.432]  Absolutely, Joe.
[01:15:13.512 --> 01:15:20.116]  I want you- Why should law-abiding citizens have to give up our rights to protect ourselves so these cowards can hide behind
[01:15:22.642 --> 01:15:25.345]  Well, you're absolutely on target, Joe Biggs.
[01:15:25.365 --> 01:15:26.846]  We're going to come back to you in a little while.
[01:15:26.966 --> 01:15:33.732]  I want to disconnect and reconnect the Skype, see if we can get a better connection, and then we're going to bring David Knight on and then bring Joe Biggs back.
[01:15:33.752 --> 01:15:36.555]  You can tell Joe is really hot under the collar.
[01:15:36.575 --> 01:15:38.737]  We're going to have a bunch of HD reports filed.
[01:15:38.757 --> 01:15:40.498]  We're going to be covering the press conferences.
[01:15:41.259 --> 01:15:42.100]  That's why they're there.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.562]  This is two hours from any major airport.
[01:15:45.183 --> 01:15:46.144]  The guys left at like
[01:15:47.341 --> 01:15:53.865]  Four o'clock yesterday, got into Virginia at about seven, and then it took them to like ten at night to get out there.
[01:15:53.885 --> 01:15:58.748]  It's in the middle of nowhere, beautiful area, and it's a tragedy.
[01:15:58.828 --> 01:16:04.992]  But, I mean, I'm more upset about 300,000 dead Syrians killed by Al Qaeda and ISIS than our government funded.
[01:16:05.553 --> 01:16:07.434]  Hillary was instrumental in running all that.
[01:16:07.474 --> 01:16:10.876]  She wants to say she's upset, she's so sad for these two dead people.
[01:16:11.576 --> 01:16:12.457]  She could care less.
[01:16:12.817 --> 01:16:13.938]  This is a cold-blooded killer.
[01:16:15.117 --> 01:16:16.457]  Fast and Furious, all of it.
[01:16:16.897 --> 01:16:21.299]  And they're just using these events to push their agenda.
[01:16:21.379 --> 01:16:22.819]  And I know everybody knows that.
[01:16:23.399 --> 01:16:26.280]  But obviously not everybody, because some people still buy into this bull.
[01:16:28.901 --> 01:16:34.062]  But the good news is, most people I talk to and when I see happening online,
[01:16:35.376 --> 01:16:39.839]  And what gun sales show, and national statistics, gun ownership is only rising.
[01:16:40.279 --> 01:16:44.282]  People are getting into guns, whether it's for self-defense, whether it's for recreation.
[01:16:44.602 --> 01:16:48.305]  It's really an exciting time to be alive, and that's why they're pushing so hard.
[01:16:49.506 --> 01:16:56.531]  But clearly, they've overdone it, and really played their hand, and that's why they're having more and more trouble.
[01:16:57.131 --> 01:16:58.292]  Alright, do we have the guys back?
[01:17:00.535 --> 01:17:05.339]  Okay, we're getting them back and we're going to get David Knight's breakdown on all of this as well.
[01:17:05.399 --> 01:17:08.481]  And this is live, radio slash TV.
[01:17:09.121 --> 01:17:13.544]  I know we have affiliates all over the country on AM and FM radio and people are like, is this a TV show?
[01:17:13.865 --> 01:17:22.371]  Yes, it's radio based, but we added television to it 10 years ago or more, so that we could document what we were saying more.
[01:17:23.612 --> 01:17:27.275]  Because I would have reporters 10 years ago or 12 years ago on the ground reporting by phone.
[01:17:27.295 --> 01:17:30.578]  People say, oh, that person wasn't really there during that urban warfare drill.
[01:17:30.998 --> 01:17:32.439]  And we'd have to put the video online.
[01:17:32.879 --> 01:17:37.343]  YouTube came along and sort of letting us, you know, add even more.
[01:17:38.083 --> 01:17:47.271]  Because I was putting videos up 15, 16, 17, 18 years ago online, but they were on my servers and I couldn't afford it.
[01:17:48.399 --> 01:17:50.700]  So that was a big, big problem there.
[01:17:51.201 --> 01:17:56.184]  But now as bandwidth's gone down, it's opened things up to allow us to build a real media platform.
[01:17:56.844 --> 01:18:05.769]  David Knight, again, joining us from right outside the small-town Virginia WDBJ Center, News Center.
[01:18:05.829 --> 01:18:07.830]  We're going to skip this network break to have more time.
[01:18:08.131 --> 01:18:09.131]  Steve Quayle's coming up.
[01:18:09.772 --> 01:18:13.574]  David Knight, tell us what you've seen so far, observations, and what's coming up today.
[01:18:17.964 --> 01:18:24.167]  Yeah, there must be so much media there that you're able to get an internet connection, but it's not able to stay up.
[01:18:24.667 --> 01:18:30.190]  Because I guarantee you that town is not used to the extra 500 people that are there covering this.
[01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:36.272]  So we'll try to reconnect with that yet again, or maybe use another Skype handle.
[01:18:37.093 --> 01:18:40.594]  And again, this is all part of what live radio slash TV is.
[01:18:41.355 --> 01:18:43.696]  Teleprompter free, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:45.203 --> 01:18:50.144]  Before we go any further, we can also just default get David Knight on telephone.
[01:18:50.904 --> 01:18:56.625]  I want to remind you that this hour is brought to you by Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[01:18:57.785 --> 01:19:01.826]  X2 is unlike any other nascent iodine out there.
[01:19:02.266 --> 01:19:10.268]  It comes from a deep earth crystal source and it goes in and basically blocks the bad halogens
[01:19:12.674 --> 01:19:13.074]  And it's
[01:19:33.291 --> 01:19:34.252]  We're good to go.
[01:19:50.243 --> 01:19:53.365]  Uh, said that, uh, himself and his whole family take this daily.
[01:19:53.786 --> 01:19:54.566]  Works great.
[01:19:54.986 --> 01:19:56.207]  Would recommend it to a friend.
[01:19:56.588 --> 01:19:57.608]  Five-star review.
[01:19:57.668 --> 01:19:58.589]  Thank you for your support.
[01:19:59.089 --> 01:20:04.693]  Sylvia in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada says, I used this product for two days and already feel better and more energized.
[01:20:05.054 --> 01:20:06.735]  My whole body feels lighter and more relaxed.
[01:20:07.015 --> 01:20:09.276]  Just love it as it gave me instant results.
[01:20:09.697 --> 01:20:13.159]  It is extremely easy to take and the taste is great.
[01:20:13.239 --> 01:20:16.381]  Thank you for providing us with such a great product.
[01:20:16.401 --> 01:20:16.862]  God bless.
[01:20:18.348 --> 01:20:22.236]  It's like when you're pushed underwater and you finally get to the top and get air.
[01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:26.004]  I mean, when you regularly have air and aren't underwater, you don't realize how much you miss it.
[01:20:28.015 --> 01:20:29.356]  Some people don't have deficiencies.
[01:20:29.376 --> 01:20:31.837]  If you eat enough seafood, things like that.
[01:20:32.717 --> 01:20:34.418]  So if you get it, it won't be that big of a deal.
[01:20:34.478 --> 01:20:38.640]  But if you do have a deficiency, which they say like half the public does, it is dramatic.
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:42.641]  Warning though, within two, three, four weeks, you'll have a detox.
[01:20:43.342 --> 01:20:45.123]  And you'll feel pretty crappy for four or five days.
[01:20:45.163 --> 01:20:47.083]  And then after that, it feels even better.
[01:20:47.123 --> 01:20:49.024]  And all this stuff will come out of your skin.
[01:20:49.925 --> 01:20:57.288]  In most people's experience, I mean, it is dramatic when you slough the bad halogens out of your thyroid and things.
[01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:17.048]  So again, Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 available exclusively at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 and we have the highest quality water filters that cut out the glyphosate and cut out
[01:21:17.948 --> 01:21:18.249]  I think so.
[01:21:32.965 --> 01:21:42.875]  We've got some of the best survival watches, some of the best optics recommended by Special Forces, all of it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:21:43.175 --> 01:21:48.360]  That's the umbrella site that then has the subsection InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:21:49.341 --> 01:21:51.643]  Now, let's go ahead and go back.
[01:21:54.161 --> 01:22:20.035]  To David Knight, let's go back to David Knight, who is outside WDBJ in Minetta, Virginia, the site of the tragic shooting, the quote, revenge race murder, bitter black reporter who gunned down white ex-colleagues, lives live on air and posted the video, online blames Charlton's shooting an anti-gay harassment manifesto.
[01:22:20.395 --> 01:22:21.476]  And I'm not tooting my horn.
[01:22:22.759 --> 01:22:30.406]  But hours before this came out, I said, I bet he did it because of Charleston shooting and the way MSNBC promoted it.
[01:22:30.526 --> 01:22:31.767]  And now that's coming out.
[01:22:31.807 --> 01:22:34.209]  I mean, you can read this from a mile away.
[01:22:34.269 --> 01:22:35.330]  This is so transparent.
[01:22:35.690 --> 01:22:37.732]  David Knight, give us your breakdown.
[01:22:38.956 --> 01:22:43.918]  David Knight from Bridgewater, and we're right across the plaza here where the shooting actually took place.
[01:22:43.938 --> 01:22:45.859]  Alex, we haven't been able to get to the crime scene.
[01:22:45.879 --> 01:22:48.160]  They have that blocked off, as Joe Biggs was telling you.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:53.362]  What we've been able to see here is the media, and as I was saying before, I don't know how much of it you got before it cut off.
[01:22:53.822 --> 01:22:55.163]  We've seen a lot of foreign press here.
[01:22:55.203 --> 01:22:57.724]  We've seen Fiji press from Japan.
[01:22:58.044 --> 01:23:05.047]  When I was looking for information, every other article on the first page of Google was foreign when I was trying to get information about Buster Flanagan.
[01:23:05.387 --> 01:23:07.468]  Then as I went a couple of pages in, they were all foreign!
[01:23:07.848 --> 01:23:10.910]  We're talking about Greece, Italy, Spain, Mexico.
[01:23:11.231 --> 01:23:13.132]  All these different countries are seizing on this.
[01:23:13.712 --> 01:23:14.453]  What do they see?
[01:23:15.033 --> 01:23:17.635]  As Joe Biggs pointed out, are we going to charge the gun with murder?
[01:23:17.715 --> 01:23:19.537]  That's what the press here is doing.
[01:23:19.857 --> 01:23:22.899]  There is a business over here that's got a large parrot.
[01:23:23.079 --> 01:23:24.240]  I don't know if you can see that or not.
[01:23:24.818 --> 01:23:25.138]  I don't know.
[01:23:40.299 --> 01:23:43.560]  He's independent of how he was motivated and that's the key thing.
[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:46.121]  He's been preparing for this for a very long time.
[01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:49.423]  His motivations as I look at it, he's an incredible narcissist.
[01:23:49.863 --> 01:23:54.665]  He would seek out jobs in media when he wasn't interested at all in reporting any facts.
[01:23:54.745 --> 01:23:57.146]  It just was about him getting in front of the camera.
[01:23:57.626 --> 01:24:02.528]  He creates this social media account a month or so before he does the actual shooting.
[01:24:03.354 --> 01:24:06.276]  And he starts telling people about himself, what he's going to do.
[01:24:06.296 --> 01:24:11.480]  He sends out his massive 23-page manifesto of what he's doing.
[01:24:11.821 --> 01:24:13.142]  It's all about him.
[01:24:13.822 --> 01:24:15.643]  But of course, there's also the racism aspect.
[01:24:15.684 --> 01:24:17.285]  He's got a history, a work history.
[01:24:21.025 --> 01:24:28.508]  Every time something went wrong, he picked a fight with people and said it was because of his race, because he was a homosexual.
[01:24:28.668 --> 01:24:32.729]  He had this chip on his shoulder and the Obama administration has fed that.
[01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:35.290]  So are we going to charge Obama with this crime?
[01:24:35.751 --> 01:24:42.013]  We just had a purge of all Confederate history saying that it was Jefferson Davis who motivated the Charleston shooter.
[01:24:42.373 --> 01:24:45.734]  What about our current sitting president pushing this race war?
[01:24:45.774 --> 01:24:47.055]  I put up a video and I titled it
[01:24:47.675 --> 01:25:03.111]  Obama's first drone strike in the race war that's what this is about creating these drones out there telling them that they're justified to doing this and if anything the media is just as culpable in this the idea that everybody wants to get their 15 minutes of fame and
[01:25:03.641 --> 01:25:05.682]  That is a key motivating factor.
[01:25:06.002 --> 01:25:08.484]  The motives behind this are what's going to drive it.
[01:25:08.504 --> 01:25:11.185]  I haven't been able to find anything in terms of SSRI.
[01:25:11.526 --> 01:25:13.947]  I think it was simply drinking the Obama Kool-Aid.
[01:25:14.207 --> 01:25:17.449]  And that's something that's been fed to people all over this country.
[01:25:17.489 --> 01:25:19.430]  Now we've seen somebody act on it for the first time.
[01:25:20.871 --> 01:25:23.513]  The headline and the video report you filed
[01:25:25.211 --> 01:25:27.274]  Obama's first domestic drone strike.
[01:25:27.334 --> 01:25:34.524]  This is an Obama bot gone off the rails and reading his manifesto, you know, he was talking about black people are out to get him too.
[01:25:35.065 --> 01:25:37.849]  So he just looks like a crazy spoiled brat baby.
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.222]  Yeah, he didn't trust anybody when he had these lawsuits.
[01:25:41.562 --> 01:25:44.905]  He wanted a jury composed solely of black women.
[01:25:45.265 --> 01:25:49.609]  He said black men beat him up because he was gay, and he had an issue with white women.
[01:25:49.649 --> 01:25:51.291]  He didn't mention white men.
[01:25:51.591 --> 01:25:54.153]  But basically, he breaks everybody into categories.
[01:25:54.493 --> 01:25:58.156]  He's absorbed all of the programming, all of the lessons.
[01:25:58.196 --> 01:25:59.097]  Which is ridiculous.
[01:25:59.177 --> 01:26:04.421]  I mean, women vary person to person more than they quote race to race, and men vary.
[01:26:04.481 --> 01:26:05.662]  It's just so mindless.
[01:26:06.423 --> 01:26:06.603]  Yeah.
[01:26:06.663 --> 01:26:10.644]  Where you just look at a group and this is how they're going to operate, this is how they're going to act.
[01:26:11.364 --> 01:26:19.386]  We've also seen in his complaints the kind of hyper political correctness combined with racism, a fear of racism, a chip on their shoulder.
[01:26:19.586 --> 01:26:24.147]  I wonder if the EEOC is going to go ahead with a complaint against the white reporter that's dead.
[01:26:24.647 --> 01:26:32.689]  Maybe they'll lynch her dead body or something because I don't think they've ever seen a harassment claim they didn't follow that was politically correct.
[01:26:33.069 --> 01:26:34.830]  What an unconstitutional organization.
[01:26:35.526 --> 01:26:38.668]  They actually, these cases happened a couple of years ago.
[01:26:39.068 --> 01:26:42.051]  I think the first one in a Florida studio was like three years ago.
[01:26:42.451 --> 01:26:46.894]  The second one with this particular... Sure, he just did say in the tweet that he'd filed stuff on her.
[01:26:47.234 --> 01:26:51.277]  He said he'd heard she'd said racist things, so the complaints were filed on her.
[01:26:51.517 --> 01:26:54.699]  And I wonder if they're gonna, you know, maybe arrest her corpse at the funeral.
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:56.060]  Exactly.
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:59.743]  Well, those cases were totally thrown out by the EEOC.
[01:27:00.726 --> 01:27:09.170]  As I was saying, you know, with his hyper-political correctness, he even in one of the complaints, Alex, was talking about a watermelon that kept appearing and disappearing around the office.
[01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:10.751]  He thought that was a sign of harassment.
[01:27:11.191 --> 01:27:14.853]  That's the kind of over-the-top paranoia, political correctness.
[01:27:14.873 --> 01:27:17.214]  There's watermelons all over the place in the South.
[01:27:17.554 --> 01:27:18.675]  Everybody eats watermelon.
[01:27:19.295 --> 01:27:21.816]  But it's like the brown bag scenario.
[01:27:21.936 --> 01:27:22.837]  Remember that we've talked about?
[01:27:22.857 --> 01:27:23.117]  Seattle.
[01:27:23.137 --> 01:27:24.457]  Brown bag, that's racism.
[01:27:24.678 --> 01:27:25.838]  Well, here it is, you know, watermelon.
[01:27:25.858 --> 01:27:26.639]  Oh, I see a watermelon.
[01:27:26.659 --> 01:27:27.239]  That's racist.
[01:27:27.873 --> 01:27:29.797]  That is what is being pushed.
[01:27:30.017 --> 01:27:30.919]  That's his motivation.
[01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:35.868]  That's what's constantly being pushed by the press, by the Democrats, for political gain.
[01:27:36.128 --> 01:27:37.731]  When you push that, you get a race war.
[01:27:37.812 --> 01:27:38.854]  They very well know that.
[01:27:39.234 --> 01:27:40.096]  That's what they want.
[01:27:40.743 --> 01:27:42.203]  And that's the motivation for this.
[01:27:42.303 --> 01:27:45.124]  He planned this for so long, he could have used any kind of weapon.
[01:27:45.544 --> 01:27:48.844]  And again, we need to point out to everybody that he bought this in retail.
[01:27:49.184 --> 01:28:01.567]  So even though Terry McAuliffe, who's nothing but a Democrat campaign manager who's become governor, and he's now campaigning for gun control, he's pushing for universal background checks, which would put background checks on private sales, on gun sales.
[01:28:01.867 --> 01:28:05.147]  But this gun was bought in a store at retail.
[01:28:05.527 --> 01:28:07.308]  So he went through all the background checks.
[01:28:07.368 --> 01:28:10.028]  It's absolutely irrelevant to what's going on here.
[01:28:11.454 --> 01:28:15.036]  Now, I know you're going to be covering some of the press conferences and things that are coming up.
[01:28:16.837 --> 01:28:20.699]  You're at a particular plaza that's just off the highway.
[01:28:21.179 --> 01:28:24.721]  It's about 10-15 miles outside of Minetta.
[01:28:25.121 --> 01:28:31.304]  Describe geographically where you're located for folks in Virginia that may want to come and be citizen journalists as well.
[01:28:31.344 --> 01:28:33.905]  And then for TV viewers, pan around.
[01:28:34.666 --> 01:28:39.188]  Is the news center across the street that I see there, that's where the shooting took place on that balcony?
[01:28:40.231 --> 01:28:45.012]  Uh, across the street, across the street over here, Alex, is where the shooting took place.
[01:28:45.312 --> 01:28:48.253]  That's why they have the police here and they've got that roped off as a crime scene.
[01:28:48.273 --> 01:28:50.094]  They're not letting anybody into that area.
[01:28:50.474 --> 01:28:54.415]  So all the press that's come here is camped out on the opposite side of the road.
[01:28:54.535 --> 01:28:54.715]  Sure.
[01:28:54.735 --> 01:29:00.516]  And they also took footage from the BBC that they caught of the police chasing the guy and him crashing.
[01:29:00.876 --> 01:29:02.577]  Why would they take the BBC's footage?
[01:29:03.777 --> 01:29:04.497]  Oh, that's interesting.
[01:29:04.537 --> 01:29:04.977]  I don't know.
[01:29:05.517 --> 01:29:05.717]  Yeah.
[01:29:06.298 --> 01:29:06.478]  Yeah.
[01:29:06.498 --> 01:29:07.698]  There's a, there's a hyper,
[01:29:08.362 --> 01:29:09.883]  Paranoia by our government.
[01:29:09.903 --> 01:29:11.303]  They want to keep everything secret.
[01:29:11.664 --> 01:29:17.806]  And all that does is feed people's concerns that there's some kind of a conspiracy going on, that they're actually up to something.
[01:29:17.846 --> 01:29:19.487]  And of course, often they are.
[01:29:19.987 --> 01:29:28.611]  But this kind of hyper-paranoia by the government that matches this kind of hyper-racism, hyper-political correctness that we're seeing everywhere.
[01:29:28.651 --> 01:29:31.973]  They want to shut everything down, censor everything, take everybody's footage.
[01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:32.273]  Sure.
[01:29:32.293 --> 01:29:34.814]  I didn't know they confiscated BBC's footage of the chase.
[01:29:36.108 --> 01:29:38.409]  Yes, the BBC's filed a formal complaint.
[01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:39.469]  I'm gonna go to break.
[01:29:39.489 --> 01:29:40.669]  Steve Quayle's coming up.
[01:29:40.890 --> 01:29:42.650]  This is a protest.
[01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:45.251]  And this is a riot.
[01:29:45.631 --> 01:29:49.452]  If you can't tell the difference, then you are part of the problem.

[01:29:59.693 --> 01:30:02.696]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.617 --> 01:30:06.439]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.203 --> 01:30:15.868]  Since yesterday's early morning Virginia News shooting, we now know more about the shooter Vester Lee Flanagan.
[01:30:16.048 --> 01:30:21.313]  He exasperated his bosses with his stiff and nervous delivery, and by his inability to use a teleprompter.
[01:30:21.473 --> 01:30:25.477]  He was also reprimanded for wearing a President Obama badge during an election report.
[01:30:25.657 --> 01:30:31.660]  In the report, his supervisor writes, this is a clear violation not only of Schertz County policy, but of standard journalistic ethics.
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:36.281]  Journalists, and particularly reporters who appear on television, must abide by a different standard.
[01:30:36.482 --> 01:30:39.783]  President Obama responded saying guns are worse than terrorism.
[01:30:40.103 --> 01:30:46.706]  What we know is that the number of people who die from gun-related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism, the president added.
[01:30:46.846 --> 01:30:54.069]  Trump responded by saying, the problem is not guns, it's mental illness, which echoes the infamous appearance Alex Jones made on the Piers Morgan Show.
[01:30:54.309 --> 01:30:55.030]  What about Prozac?
[01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:57.574]  You know the number one... Oh, that's the big sponsor, isn't it?
[01:30:57.614 --> 01:30:59.096]  Don't want to talk about the U.S.
[01:30:59.116 --> 01:31:04.744]  The number one cause of death is suicide now because they give people suicide mass murder pills!
[01:31:04.985 --> 01:31:07.649]  Check out the video reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:09.632]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com
[01:31:10.052 --> 01:31:15.678]  Supermail Vitality is InfoWarsLife.com's number one selling product for a good reason.

[01:31:40.222 --> 01:31:45.267]  Super Mel Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com has sold out multiple times in the last three months.

[01:32:09.719 --> 01:32:12.920]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:32:13.221 --> 01:32:21.224]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:32:21.464 --> 01:32:26.486]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:32:26.886 --> 01:32:29.187]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:42.781]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:32:42.901 --> 01:32:47.623]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:32:47.883 --> 01:32:49.544]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[01:32:49.584 --> 01:32:51.045]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:32:51.185 --> 01:32:54.386]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:32:54.666 --> 01:32:56.447]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:32:56.647 --> 01:32:58.528]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:32:58.748 --> 01:33:00.689]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:33:00.749 --> 01:33:06.331]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:17.715 --> 01:33:22.116]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[01:33:22.736 --> 01:33:26.317]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[01:33:26.737 --> 01:33:28.318]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:33:28.798 --> 01:33:30.438]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:33:31.018 --> 01:33:32.699]  John has a long mustache.
[01:33:33.019 --> 01:33:34.639]  John has a long mustache.
[01:33:35.059 --> 01:33:37.760]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:42.021]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[01:33:47.924 --> 01:33:49.365]  But they took a lot of people away.
[01:33:49.806 --> 01:33:51.708]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[01:33:51.948 --> 01:33:54.550]  People that had guns or things they wanted, they just took them away.
[01:33:55.151 --> 01:33:55.431]  Where?
[01:33:56.512 --> 01:33:58.334]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[01:33:58.634 --> 01:34:06.842]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:34:06.862 --> 01:34:10.746]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[01:34:17.008 --> 01:34:18.729]  I'm a sorry citizen.
[01:34:18.849 --> 01:34:20.290]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[01:34:30.515 --> 01:34:32.235]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[01:34:32.295 --> 01:34:33.296]  would you see that happening?
[01:34:33.356 --> 01:34:38.056]  I mean, we've got a lot of constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[01:34:38.136 --> 01:34:46.298]  Plus, you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[01:34:47.918 --> 01:34:53.779]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[01:34:53.939 --> 01:34:58.500]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community
[01:35:05.267 --> 01:35:07.908]  That's what we're doing here, and let's not kid about it.
[01:35:07.928 --> 01:35:11.730]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:12.791]  Seriously?
[01:35:12.871 --> 01:35:13.912]  Put your gun down, really?
[01:35:16.073 --> 01:35:20.495]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:35:21.075 --> 01:35:22.636]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:35:22.916 --> 01:35:27.018]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[01:35:28.019 --> 01:35:31.901]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:35:41.434 --> 01:35:44.297]  And we're watching a globalist economic culture war.
[01:35:45.678 --> 01:35:56.287]  And whereas in the fictional Red Dawn, they're watching tanks, you know, basically attack the US military and take over the police department and kill the local government leaders that aren't collaborators.
[01:35:57.128 --> 01:35:59.909]  We're watching our society, our culture, dismantled.
[01:36:00.609 --> 01:36:06.472]  We're watching our energy system shut down, our jobs shipped overseas, our families attacked, our food and water poisoned.
[01:36:06.872 --> 01:36:10.593]  Steve Quayle joins us in about five minutes for the balance of the broadcast.
[01:36:10.653 --> 01:36:16.756]  The original prepper, the original survivalist, been a survivalist for over 30 years, been
[01:36:18.197 --> 01:36:26.484]  On air 25 years, and I used to hear him 25 years ago, and I thought he was sincere, but I thought about 80% of what he was saying was true.
[01:36:26.724 --> 01:36:30.067]  And now I think about 95% of it's accurate.
[01:36:31.028 --> 01:36:33.430]  But who knows, the next five, maybe I'll be proven wrong.
[01:36:34.091 --> 01:36:38.294]  I mean, it's just the stuff he used to say sounded so wild, and now it's every day.
[01:36:38.334 --> 01:36:42.518]  I mean, he's really the guy, more than anybody, I've got to say, who said stuff first.
[01:36:45.148 --> 01:36:47.609]  I mean, I had him on as a guest 20 years ago, and I respected him.
[01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:53.273]  I just, I argued with him and disagreed with him on a lot of stuff, and he'd get frustrated, and just say, fine, you'll see.
[01:36:53.293 --> 01:36:57.435]  So we're going to be talking to him about everything, you know, that's going on.
[01:36:57.795 --> 01:37:01.678]  SteveQuell.com, he hosts the Q-Files, very popular, almost popular online shows.
[01:37:02.475 --> 01:37:07.077]  He's been syndicated before, and of course he's probably the most popular other than myself and a few others.
[01:37:07.637 --> 01:37:12.539]  He's in the top three or four top guests on Coast to Coast, I've been told, with George Norrie.
[01:37:12.899 --> 01:37:13.599]  So he joins us.
[01:37:13.619 --> 01:37:15.039]  We appreciate him joining us here in a minute.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:19.781]  I wanted to go back to Joe Biggs, and parental discretion is advised.
[01:37:19.841 --> 01:37:21.142]  While he's talking, I'm going to show...
[01:37:22.389 --> 01:37:23.670]  Well, it was censored yesterday.
[01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:24.930]  Drudge linked to the video.
[01:37:25.671 --> 01:37:32.914]  Other media did show it, but the first person shooter, shooting the reporter and the cameraman, there's no blood.
[01:37:32.934 --> 01:37:37.456]  He does shoot her three times, it looks like, and she runs in high heels.
[01:37:38.036 --> 01:37:39.037]  And a lot of folks said
[01:37:40.612 --> 01:37:41.353]  They don't believe that.
[01:37:41.393 --> 01:37:42.173]  They think it's fake.
[01:37:42.233 --> 01:37:43.874]  Well, we know some stuff's been staged.
[01:37:43.894 --> 01:37:45.855]  We know much of Sandy Hook isn't, as they say.
[01:37:46.576 --> 01:37:48.097]  We know the Aurora shooting is staged.
[01:37:48.777 --> 01:37:50.538]  But I've shot wild boar.
[01:37:50.679 --> 01:37:51.479]  I've shot elk.
[01:37:51.579 --> 01:37:52.520]  I've shot whitetail.
[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:53.460]  I've shot mule.
[01:37:54.961 --> 01:37:59.104]  And sometimes you shoot one with a 7-mil mag and they fall right there.
[01:37:59.864 --> 01:38:06.269]  Sometimes you shoot a little whitetail, the 30-odd-6, and they run 500 yards, even though their heart is blown in half.
[01:38:07.594 --> 01:38:13.883]  Joe, you know, it's in the news, they covered, you've had quite a few kills in the Army yourself, and been blown up a few times yourself.
[01:38:13.923 --> 01:38:14.944]  You've had experience with this.
[01:38:15.385 --> 01:38:17.007]  It looks like a first-person shoot-em-up.
[01:38:17.448 --> 01:38:23.316]  I don't think the White House is beyond doing this, but the narrative would be he'd be Tea Party or something, and they'd have been on the ground ready.
[01:38:23.977 --> 01:38:29.000]  Like we saw, Bloomberg sent an email the night before saying, get ready, big thing's about to happen.
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.381]  That was in mainstream news.
[01:38:30.881 --> 01:38:32.602]  They had the port-a-potties being delivered.
[01:38:32.662 --> 01:38:34.603]  They were already with PR at Sandy Hook.
[01:38:34.843 --> 01:38:36.144]  The school had been closed before.
[01:38:36.424 --> 01:38:38.805]  You know, the evidence goes on and on that something's not right.
[01:38:39.025 --> 01:38:46.530]  We don't know exactly what, but even Rob Dew's uncle, that's a retired FBI agent, has gone there and says he's never seen anything like it and looks like a cover-up.
[01:38:47.495 --> 01:38:58.963]  So yeah, people are on the case, but watching that video that will roll while you're talking of him shooting her, we're not going to put it back on YouTube because we don't want to get censored again, but my own show, I can roll it.
[01:39:00.684 --> 01:39:05.587]  Why do you think they don't want this being seen, A, and then B, does it look real to you?
[01:39:05.607 --> 01:39:10.890]  Well, I mean, it's interesting, you know, when I saw the gun go up, I could automatically tell.
[01:39:11.011 --> 01:39:12.492]  I mean, to me, it looks like a Glock.
[01:39:12.552 --> 01:39:14.453]  I think that it's come out now that it is a Glock.
[01:39:14.833 --> 01:39:15.373]  I own a Glock.
[01:39:15.433 --> 01:39:16.174]  I know what they look like.
[01:39:16.895 --> 01:39:24.077]  Uh, but you gotta, for me, I'm not willing to jump into the whole, it's a staged event pool yet, because there's still more to go.
[01:39:24.277 --> 01:39:27.598]  I'm still, I still have an opportunity to go over here and see and look for myself.
[01:39:27.638 --> 01:39:29.578]  So until then, I'm not ready to go to that.
[01:39:29.598 --> 01:39:35.260]  I really think this was a disturbed man who just went over the line and just made a huge, horrible, bad decision.
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:37.201]  Angry, racist man.
[01:39:37.742 --> 01:39:41.966]  And the fact of being shot, yeah, you could be shot and still run away for a little bit.
[01:39:42.326 --> 01:39:45.208]  You're still going to have some momentum, you're going to be scared, your adrenaline's going to pump.
[01:39:45.489 --> 01:39:47.671]  You can see that she saw that, had that look in her eye.
[01:39:48.131 --> 01:39:50.793]  That's going to automatically put that adrenaline rush into your body.
[01:39:51.374 --> 01:39:54.837]  And her automatic thing was to start turning anyways as she got hit.
[01:39:55.197 --> 01:39:59.041]  So she could have used that momentum as she turned to essentially push forward.
[01:39:59.281 --> 01:40:00.362]  We don't know how far she went.
[01:40:00.402 --> 01:40:02.063]  We don't know if she took 5 steps, 10 steps, 20 steps.
[01:40:02.964 --> 01:40:04.525]  But I'm sure she eventually fell over.
[01:40:04.545 --> 01:40:06.645]  Sure, well you can see that she jerks.
[01:40:07.126 --> 01:40:08.706]  He shoots her in the abdomen first.
[01:40:09.246 --> 01:40:11.027]  You watch the footage and that's my experience.
[01:40:11.107 --> 01:40:11.827]  I think it's real.
[01:40:12.248 --> 01:40:14.989]  I was just throwing out that we're being criticized for saying it's real.
[01:40:15.349 --> 01:40:16.469]  Not everything is fake.
[01:40:17.069 --> 01:40:17.770]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:19.991]  There's a lot more that needs to be seen.
[01:40:20.011 --> 01:40:22.231]  There's a lot more that needs to go on.
[01:40:22.251 --> 01:40:23.492]  What I do think is happening
[01:40:23.834 --> 01:40:40.922]  Because I think a senseless act of violence happened by a lone person who made a stupid decision, who was a horrible person, and now the mainstream media is using this to push their anti-gun movement into the public's eyes.
[01:40:41.002 --> 01:40:41.962]  That's what's going on.
[01:40:41.982 --> 01:40:43.123]  That's a horrendous act.
[01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:44.190]  That's happening.
[01:40:44.431 --> 01:40:58.961]  Besides the two people being murdered, the fact that these people over here behind me are going to use this situation, this scenario, and push their anti-gun stuff so law-abiding citizens all across this country will no longer be able to defend themselves.
[01:40:59.181 --> 01:41:04.345]  That is the atrocity happening here in Minetta, Virginia at the Bridgewater Plaza, Alex.
[01:41:06.741 --> 01:41:08.062]  Joe Biggs, thank you so much.
[01:41:08.082 --> 01:41:11.425]  I know you're filing a lot of other reports for the Nightly News tonight, seven o'clock central.
[01:41:11.445 --> 01:41:13.887]  You're going to be asking real questions at the press conferences.
[01:41:14.287 --> 01:41:19.331]  You've done this at a lot of other big press conferences and made national news, getting real questions out there.
[01:41:19.591 --> 01:41:21.673]  So great job to you and David Knight.
[01:41:22.273 --> 01:41:23.234]  Give them hell, my friend.
[01:41:24.255 --> 01:41:24.615]  Will do.
[01:41:24.635 --> 01:41:25.176]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:41:25.376 --> 01:41:25.596]  All right.
[01:41:25.616 --> 01:41:27.257]  They're out there standing up for the Second Amendment.
[01:41:27.878 --> 01:41:30.200]  And of course, you notice we're not blaming black people for this.
[01:41:31.547 --> 01:41:36.952]  Just like the senseless evil killing of nine black people was absolutely disgusting in Charleston.
[01:41:37.312 --> 01:41:42.257]  It is mentally ill people, whacked out of their minds, stirred up by the media.
[01:41:43.578 --> 01:41:48.363]  But we are going to go with the angle, ban the rainbow flag, because he had a rainbow flag at his house.
[01:41:49.701 --> 01:41:51.142]  He said he did this for gay rights.
[01:41:51.923 --> 01:41:55.645]  So all people that are gay, it's your fault.
[01:41:55.845 --> 01:41:57.026]  I'm not actually saying that.
[01:41:57.687 --> 01:41:58.767]  But see how that feels?
[01:41:59.668 --> 01:42:01.989]  To have someone blame you for what somebody else does?
[01:42:02.130 --> 01:42:02.750]  It's ridiculous.
[01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:05.552]  Steve Quayle is joining us here in just one moment.
[01:42:05.612 --> 01:42:08.894]  I want to remind people that the special will end tomorrow.
[01:42:09.615 --> 01:42:10.896]  Friday is the last day.
[01:42:12.759 --> 01:42:18.622]  We are selling the highest quality colloidal silver that is just so amazing on so many fronts.
[01:42:18.642 --> 01:42:19.963]  Read the scientific info.
[01:42:20.383 --> 01:42:23.765]  See the videos that break it down at infowarslife.com.
[01:42:24.125 --> 01:42:26.246]  Buy two bottles at the regular price.
[01:42:26.887 --> 01:42:30.729]  We didn't jack the price up and then say, buy two, get two free, like these firework places.
[01:42:31.269 --> 01:42:33.870]  You know, other folks, it's the regular discounted price.
[01:42:35.411 --> 01:42:38.013]  Buy two bottles, get two free.
[01:42:39.028 --> 01:42:47.151]  And your purchase helps fund the operation so I can send reporters to these key events and hopefully wake people up with our reportage.
[01:42:47.531 --> 01:42:48.852]  Buy two bottles, get two free.
[01:42:49.512 --> 01:42:58.315]  Or buy one bottle, get 30% off two different specials on Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[01:43:01.388 --> 01:43:04.270]  888-253-3139.
[01:43:05.451 --> 01:43:10.736]  You can also write to us and we'll honor those orders if they're postmarked by Friday.
[01:43:10.756 --> 01:43:13.358]  You can go to Infowarslife.com and the P.O.
[01:43:13.398 --> 01:43:17.701]  Box is up on the top of the site as well if you'd rather mail something to us.
[01:43:18.142 --> 01:43:18.982]  And that's P.O.
[01:43:19.002 --> 01:43:19.222]  Box
[01:43:20.683 --> 01:43:25.907]  1-9-5-4-9 Austin, Texas 7-8-7-6-0.
[01:43:26.547 --> 01:43:26.847]  P.O.
[01:43:26.867 --> 01:43:31.290]  Box 1-9-5-4-9 Austin, Texas 7-8-7-6-0.
[01:43:31.770 --> 01:43:41.716]  And we have Super Mill Vitality, Prostagard, super high quality oil of oregano from the Mediterranean, the highest quality and a lot of other products at Infowarslife.com.
[01:43:43.437 --> 01:43:49.269]  Oxy Powder, Survival Shield X2, Secret 12, Super Female Vitality, Knockout.
[01:43:49.329 --> 01:43:50.130]  Is Knockout back in stock?
[01:43:50.150 --> 01:43:50.932]  I thought that was sold out.
[01:43:50.952 --> 01:43:51.333]  Scroll down.
[01:43:52.435 --> 01:43:53.096]  Oh, it is sold out.
[01:43:53.116 --> 01:43:53.336]  Darn.
[01:43:54.158 --> 01:43:59.299]  Because I've run out of bottle of that only and I took one bottle home and just ran out last night and the last couple months use it all.
[01:43:59.319 --> 01:44:06.381]  I don't use it every night but I do a lot and I am out myself and they were looking around yesterday there is none in the office even.
[01:44:07.101 --> 01:44:07.501]  Darn it!
[01:44:08.402 --> 01:44:09.362]  I misread that.
[01:44:09.722 --> 01:44:11.162]  That is a super big bummer.
[01:44:12.043 --> 01:44:15.063]  But that's all available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:44:15.724 --> 01:44:16.824]  Now, shifting gears.
[01:44:18.376 --> 01:44:35.473]  We are joined by Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com, the first guy, 20 years ago, who was writing best-selling books about them taking human baby fetus brains and putting them in dogs, cats, cockroaches, mice, the first guy I heard talk about
[01:44:36.590 --> 01:44:40.314]  Geoengineering, terraforming, manipulating the weather.
[01:44:40.734 --> 01:44:50.063]  The first guy I heard talk about so many issues, I heard him, it was like seven, eight years ago, say they're doing the census to track
[01:44:51.363 --> 01:44:53.865]  Where you live to mark your house for drone strikes.
[01:44:54.405 --> 01:44:56.787]  And then now they admitted that the military's been given all that data.
[01:44:56.807 --> 01:44:57.808]  They're now arming drones.
[01:44:58.348 --> 01:45:02.131]  So, it's easy to make fun of him, but I gotta tell ya, he's willing to really say what he thinks.
[01:45:02.572 --> 01:45:04.813]  And so much of what he said has turned out to be true.
[01:45:05.294 --> 01:45:09.097]  SteveQuayle.com hosts the Q-Files, joins us.
[01:45:09.137 --> 01:45:10.718]  Steve, thank you for coming on.
[01:45:10.758 --> 01:45:12.479]  I'm not even gonna throw out a bunch of issues.
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:15.182]  I got a bunch of questions for you, but front and center,
[01:45:15.842 --> 01:45:18.723]  You've got the floor here for the balance of the hour, the next 15 minutes.
[01:45:19.443 --> 01:45:25.404]  What do you want to say about the world meltdown of the markets, about the shooting, about what is this distracting us from?
[01:45:25.704 --> 01:45:27.724]  Donald Trump, where is it all?
[01:45:28.144 --> 01:45:29.564]  ISIS spreading all over the world.
[01:45:30.064 --> 01:45:30.725]  Steve Quayle.
[01:45:32.025 --> 01:45:36.986]  Well, Alex, thank you and good afternoon to all Infowarriors all around the world.
[01:45:37.046 --> 01:45:39.546]  But what's going on right now is pretty critical.
[01:45:40.346 --> 01:45:45.087]  First of all, I think the idea that we're in full motion gun
[01:45:45.856 --> 01:45:46.216]  I think?
[01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:11.132]  Are here to basically do two things, to assert their domination control of the United States and also to disarm.
[01:46:11.732 --> 01:46:25.707]  I was told years ago, went on the radio, may have said it on your show, but basically part of the agreement between US government and China to continue buying our debt was that we would agree to, excuse me, allow the disarmament
[01:46:26.267 --> 01:46:26.488]  We're good.
[01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:48.952]  Most people didn't understand the term yard farming in those days.
[01:46:49.012 --> 01:46:50.794]  It was Greg Evenson who brought that up.
[01:46:51.394 --> 01:46:56.899]  I want on record yard farming means literally using drone strikes against American citizens.
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:00.021]  So many people thought that was outlandish.
[01:47:00.082 --> 01:47:05.586]  So many people thought that I'd gone over the edge and that basically I was a fear porn purveyor.
[01:47:05.706 --> 01:47:07.568]  I was a whatever Armageddonite.
[01:47:08.268 --> 01:47:13.693]  But all those things now are coming to be into the focus to prove that that's really the plan.
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:33.708]  With the advent of all the forest fires in the Northwest, this was part of the plan also that Ant, what is his name, Ant, you know, Anatoly Golitsyn wrote about in two of his books, which basically are going right by the script, you know, and one of them was New Lies for Old and the Perestroika Deception.
[01:47:34.208 --> 01:47:40.631]  The bottom line in both that was the Russians faked their own demise to get investment in the West and still having the plan.
[01:47:40.651 --> 01:47:46.993]  Now listen, I'm going to quote somebody that I used to quote all the time in the first 10 years that I was on talk radio.
[01:47:47.890 --> 01:47:55.236]  My guy named, uh, I think it was Boris Manuelski, and he was a professor at the Lenin School of Political Warfare in Moscow.
[01:47:55.296 --> 01:47:57.298]  So many people I just don't get the big picture.
[01:47:57.798 --> 01:48:00.901]  I pray, by the grace of God, I can give them the big picture.
[01:48:01.481 --> 01:48:03.883]  The bourgeois will have to be put to sleep.
[01:48:04.063 --> 01:48:08.267]  So shall we begin by launching the most spectacular peace movement on record.
[01:48:08.967 --> 01:48:09.487]  I don't know.
[01:48:24.694 --> 01:48:30.438]  Is in order to understand the New World Order, people must get the basic.
[01:48:30.498 --> 01:48:31.158]  It's simply this.
[01:48:31.759 --> 01:48:37.982]  All borders, nationalities, cultures, and language must basically be done away with.
[01:48:38.443 --> 01:48:43.466]  The elite literally have no problem talking about the death of six billion people.
[01:48:43.826 --> 01:48:52.032]  And that's why, just to interrupt, they do things that are unconstitutional, that are unpopular, and aren't even law, because they say they've got the international treaties.
[01:48:52.072 --> 01:48:52.893]  And you mentioned this.
[01:48:52.913 --> 01:48:54.033]  I want to throw this out.
[01:48:54.614 --> 01:48:55.755]  This is out of Bloomberg News.
[01:48:56.275 --> 01:48:57.376]  China sells U.S.
[01:48:57.436 --> 01:48:59.437]  Treasuries to support their Yuan.
[01:49:00.018 --> 01:49:01.659]  That is an unprecedented move.
[01:49:02.079 --> 01:49:10.425]  So there's also some infighting, but it's globalist multinationals controlling Russia, controlling China, controlling the U.S., playing us off against each other.
[01:49:10.665 --> 01:49:11.886]  But that's the unseen hand.
[01:49:11.946 --> 01:49:12.487]  Correct, Steve?
[01:49:13.267 --> 01:49:13.987]  Absolutely.
[01:49:14.087 --> 01:49:23.371]  And the thing is, is that even in the famous statement, you know, that some argue over on the three great world wars, which would be fomented.
[01:49:23.631 --> 01:49:26.652]  Obviously, we're talking about Mazzini's letter.
[01:49:26.672 --> 01:49:33.375]  That is absolutely Albert Pike, whether you want to believe it or not, not you, Alex, but whether the people want to believe it or not.
[01:49:33.995 --> 01:49:35.017]  We're good to go.
[01:49:49.296 --> 01:49:50.477]  We're good to go.
[01:50:08.394 --> 01:50:15.401]  That we're going to be shipped overseas, and that all the foreign troops that have been training here are going to be given the go-ahead.
[01:50:15.441 --> 01:50:32.877]  Now, whether people want to admit it or not, one of the purposes of whether they're a false flag, real shooting, MK-Ultra, Mind Control-E, disenfranchised video game player, most of these trained killers have multiple identities.
[01:50:33.477 --> 01:50:40.005]  And you and I have talked about Mind Control MKUltra until we're blue in the face, but evidently most people still don't get it.
[01:50:40.485 --> 01:50:43.909]  Remember, it's not what really happens that counts.
[01:50:44.029 --> 01:50:47.854]  It's what's made to look like what they want to happen that counts.
[01:50:48.434 --> 01:50:55.098]  So again, the mass media, and again, to go on record, I believe they are nothing more than vomit brokers.
[01:50:55.518 --> 01:50:57.620]  You're seeing that play out daily.
[01:50:57.780 --> 01:50:58.860]  Steve Quayle, stay there.
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:50:59.301]  Stay there.
[01:50:59.321 --> 01:51:03.263]  We're going to come right back and continue with where you see the world going straight ahead.
[01:51:03.363 --> 01:51:07.145]  And later in the next hour, we're going to open the phones up for your questions for Steve Quayle.
[01:51:07.485 --> 01:51:08.246]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:51:10.265 --> 01:51:14.187]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:14.227 --> 01:51:17.128]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:17.308 --> 01:51:18.628]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:18.868 --> 01:51:21.770]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:22.110 --> 01:51:24.671]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:51:24.691 --> 01:51:27.312]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.

[01:51:44.565 --> 01:51:46.886]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:47.387 --> 01:51:49.248]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:49.688 --> 01:51:53.731]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[01:53:09.659 --> 01:53:10.679]  That's disgusting.
[01:53:10.859 --> 01:53:11.619]  What's that smell?
[01:53:11.899 --> 01:53:13.600]  Roll down your window before I pass out.
[01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:16.041]  It's those nasty fish oil pills I've been taking.
[01:53:16.381 --> 01:53:19.082]  Why won't you just switch to Nutrigold fish oil like I did?
[01:53:19.502 --> 01:53:20.362]  It's fish oil.
[01:53:20.462 --> 01:53:21.363]  What's the difference?
[01:53:21.583 --> 01:53:25.624]  Well, my Nutrigold fish oil is sourced and manufactured right here in the USA.
[01:53:26.138 --> 01:53:27.260]  What's so special about that?
[01:53:27.341 --> 01:53:27.862]  Aren't they all?
[01:53:28.022 --> 01:53:28.603]  Are you kidding?
[01:53:28.804 --> 01:53:29.585]  Of course not!
[01:53:29.946 --> 01:53:34.676]  Only Nutrigold fish oil is 100% USA made, which is why it's so fresh.
[01:53:36.097 --> 01:53:37.958]  100% product of USA and fresh?
[01:53:38.258 --> 01:53:39.418]  I like the sound of that.
[01:53:39.638 --> 01:53:40.919]  So, no more fish burps?
[01:53:41.179 --> 01:53:42.039]  No more fish burps.
[01:53:42.219 --> 01:53:42.979]  And that's not all.
[01:53:43.319 --> 01:53:49.901]  If you go to www.fishoil.fest and enter my fish oil, you can save $5 like I did.
[01:53:50.341 --> 01:53:51.221]  That won't be necessary.
[01:53:51.281 --> 01:53:52.442]  We can just share your bottle.
[01:53:52.722 --> 01:53:53.362]  Nice try.
[01:53:53.522 --> 01:53:56.563]  Get your own at www.fishoil.fest.
[01:53:58.010 --> 01:53:58.351]  Sorry.
[01:53:58.451 --> 01:53:59.913]  Get rid of those fish burps for good.
[01:54:00.033 --> 01:54:01.115]  Go to Nutrigold's U.S.
[01:54:01.155 --> 01:54:08.247]  made fish oil products by going to www.fishoil.best and get $5 off by entering my fish oil at checkout.
[01:54:32.182 --> 01:54:34.844]  I started getting politically involved a little bit more savvy.
[01:54:34.864 --> 01:54:37.985]  I was like a mainline libertarian until about 93, 94.
[01:54:38.145 --> 01:54:40.066]  I was in college then.
[01:54:42.628 --> 01:54:46.870]  And I remember hearing, you know, they got Russian troops, they got Chinese troops, they're training them.
[01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:50.172]  And I think these old-timers, mainly military vets, are crazy.
[01:54:51.112 --> 01:54:54.014]  I wasn't disliking military vets, I just thought they were paranoid.
[01:54:55.134 --> 01:54:59.697]  And then they'd have black helicopter drills all over Texas and blowing up buildings, people having heart attacks.
[01:55:01.124 --> 01:55:03.046]  Folks would cover it and they'd get death threats.
[01:55:03.346 --> 01:55:08.292]  And I got on air and I'd cover it and there'd be military in plain clothes threatening me in the parking lot.
[01:55:10.294 --> 01:55:11.475]  Like, you better watch it, buddy.
[01:55:11.495 --> 01:55:13.778]  And it'd be military guys in plain clothes.
[01:55:14.859 --> 01:55:18.363]  And then I had people pull guns on me and just everything else just because I was covering it.
[01:55:18.463 --> 01:55:19.925]  I was like, wow, this whole thing's real.
[01:55:21.186 --> 01:55:24.409]  Then I became a source for people to be able to get info out.
[01:55:24.489 --> 01:55:27.072]  I started getting, you name it, NSA stuff.
[01:55:27.593 --> 01:55:28.213]  Just crazy.
[01:55:28.253 --> 01:55:30.495]  I mean, I was being educated by my audience.
[01:55:31.356 --> 01:55:32.638]  And then there's Steve Quayle going...
[01:55:34.465 --> 01:55:41.949]  They're training Russian troops at this base outside Denver and this base outside Colorado Springs, and they're training them under secret treaties for gun confiscation.
[01:55:42.009 --> 01:55:43.809]  I'm like, that just can't be true.
[01:55:44.570 --> 01:55:53.074]  And then now, two years ago and last year, it comes out in the Denver Post, it comes out in AP, we'll put them on screen, Russian troops trained to fight domestic terrorists in America.
[01:55:53.094 --> 01:55:55.795]  And you're like, but we're at war with Russia.
[01:55:56.335 --> 01:56:01.138]  Well, it's all part of these treaties, so they have to let the US over there, they're over here, there's Fox News.
[01:56:02.410 --> 01:56:03.751]  And this is really going on.
[01:56:03.771 --> 01:56:05.612]  It's what the Chinese have been giving the Panama Canal.
[01:56:06.113 --> 01:56:06.733]  It's globalism.
[01:56:06.773 --> 01:56:08.114]  It's part of this balance of power.
[01:56:08.534 --> 01:56:13.377]  There's a lot of double-crossing going on, major drills against the Chinese right now.
[01:56:13.818 --> 01:56:18.501]  What do you think, in the four minutes we've got to break, Steve Queldon, we'll come back and you can flesh stuff out.
[01:56:20.159 --> 01:56:22.381]  How do you see the power structure set up in the world?
[01:56:22.781 --> 01:56:24.463]  And what do you think's going on right now?
[01:56:24.503 --> 01:56:30.068]  Because clearly, there's the most action I've ever seen going on, and massive amounts of foreign troops.
[01:56:30.448 --> 01:56:36.994]  Even Washington Post admits, quote, Canadian and Mexican troops will be used during martial law for, quote, civil unrest.
[01:56:37.435 --> 01:56:38.836]  I mean, this is in the newspapers.
[01:56:39.176 --> 01:56:39.817]  What's going on?
[01:56:40.882 --> 01:56:42.002]  Well, obviously, Alex.
[01:56:42.082 --> 01:56:43.663]  It takes money to fund terrorism.
[01:56:43.703 --> 01:56:44.223]  Remember this.
[01:56:44.663 --> 01:56:47.244]  Terrorism is always someone's army.
[01:56:47.644 --> 01:56:51.285]  That's a statement that I stand by for the past 25 years.
[01:56:51.725 --> 01:56:52.245]  Talk radio.
[01:56:52.305 --> 01:57:01.028]  Let's take ISIS, one of the most well-funded, well-equipped, savvy international oil investors, currency manipulators, drug dealers, and all that.
[01:57:01.128 --> 01:57:02.048]  Who does that sound like?
[01:57:02.088 --> 01:57:06.890]  That sounds like a very sophisticated, intelligence-generated and
[01:57:07.330 --> 01:57:08.011]  We're good to go.
[01:57:21.164 --> 01:57:23.506]  That they're already on the chopping block.
[01:57:23.546 --> 01:57:25.488]  And see, that's the critical issue here.
[01:57:25.908 --> 01:57:27.249]  Things have escalated.
[01:57:27.269 --> 01:57:38.638]  It is my intent to make it clear, by the grace of God today, we are absolutely in that prepositioning of an attack by Russia and China.
[01:57:39.078 --> 01:57:43.762]  You brought up the amount of money that China is dumping to support the yuan.
[01:57:44.203 --> 01:57:45.644]  You brought up all these things.
[01:57:45.704 --> 01:57:48.366]  The elites are scurrying out of the US at record rates.
[01:57:48.406 --> 01:57:49.427]  That's even in mainstream news.
[01:57:50.251 --> 01:57:51.012]  Absolutely.
[01:57:51.352 --> 01:57:51.933]  What happens?
[01:57:52.093 --> 01:57:54.916]  Well, you know, the old statement, rats abandoning ship, you know?
[01:57:54.936 --> 01:57:59.521]  Well, they abandoned it in their Gulf Streams and in their, you know, two and three hundred million dollar yachts.
[01:57:59.621 --> 01:58:03.125]  But those in the know obviously go.
[01:58:03.465 --> 01:58:06.128]  Those who are, how should I say this, ignorant,
[01:58:06.588 --> 01:58:22.918]  Stay, but if in this is what I'm not talking about anybody fleeing the country But what I'm saying is is that you know people have got to recognize This is as you have so appropriately entitled that this is the end Game in place everything up until the time Alex say you've been on radio.
[01:58:22.938 --> 01:58:26.660]  I've been on radio others have been on radio warning That's all past now
[01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:29.201]  We aren't approaching the cliff.
[01:58:29.481 --> 01:58:30.821]  We're over the cliff.
[01:58:30.861 --> 01:58:32.402]  It's just like an avalanche, okay?
[01:58:32.782 --> 01:58:36.103]  And what is terrifying is that people are going to get caught in the avalanche.
[01:58:36.163 --> 01:58:37.764]  I talked to so many investors.
[01:58:38.184 --> 01:58:39.505]  I talked to women... Stay there.
[01:58:39.685 --> 01:58:47.908]  I want to hear from your intel and your gut where you think the economy's going, how this is happening, and how we can have a soft landing, maybe, and not have this happen.
[01:58:47.928 --> 01:58:49.128]  Because we know we've been holding it back.
[01:58:49.168 --> 01:58:53.349]  I mean, the people that love Liberty Worldwide, good people in government, mainly, corporations, they're good.
[01:58:53.610 --> 01:58:54.610]  We have good people everywhere.
[01:58:54.810 --> 01:58:56.511]  That's one reason this hasn't come down yet.
[01:58:56.531 --> 01:58:57.172]  I just got chills.
[01:58:57.492 --> 01:58:58.673]  You can feel the evil right now.

[02:00:22.668 --> 02:00:23.569]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.209 --> 02:00:27.872]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.413 --> 02:00:32.456]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:40.248 --> 02:00:43.229]  Now into our number three, Steve Quayle is our guest.
[02:00:43.249 --> 02:00:46.131]  You can find his books and films at SteveQuayle.com.
[02:00:46.171 --> 02:00:57.696]  In fact, towards the end of the interview, we're going to talk some about some of the really wild stuff he gets into, studying ancient history, what the elites are suppressing in his research, and what he's discovered about, you know, these ancient legends.
[02:00:58.077 --> 02:01:04.099]  In fact, briefly, Steve, well, we'll get to that towards the end of the show, but it's very, very exciting.
[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:06.601]  Now, Steve, going back to you right now,
[02:01:07.601 --> 02:01:20.153]  Looking at the economy, looking at the world, looking at the huge stock market manipulations, huge military forces of the US, naval forces off the coast of China right now today, massive things happening.
[02:01:20.773 --> 02:01:24.136]  What point are we at now and who are the power players?
[02:01:24.176 --> 02:01:24.777]  What's going on?
[02:01:25.695 --> 02:01:29.436]  Well, first of all, I believe there was a time when we could have made a difference.
[02:01:29.496 --> 02:01:31.117]  I want to make sure everyone understands.
[02:01:31.597 --> 02:01:46.982]  I'm not saying abandon hope, ye who enter here into the world of what's really going on, but understand your number one priority, your priority, your priority, your priority is to get prepared for they're going to crash the financial system.
[02:01:47.442 --> 02:01:51.463]  Alex, you have every monetary authority in the world on your
[02:01:52.023 --> 02:01:52.664]  I think so.
[02:02:09.225 --> 02:02:16.947]  The issue is that that was nothing more than a manipulated event to make a lot of people a lot of money.
[02:02:17.047 --> 02:02:25.149]  One of the questions that's not being asked, Alex, is all the losers, we know who lost the money, but who were the gainers?
[02:02:25.229 --> 02:02:30.790]  I tell people, follow the money, that still works, the gainers were the ones who manipulated it.
[02:02:30.890 --> 02:02:34.931]  Find the short sellers on the Dow and you'll find out who did it.
[02:02:35.331 --> 02:02:39.454]  Obviously Soros is being blamed for a large part of it, but it goes even beyond him.
[02:02:39.474 --> 02:02:52.502]  And what's happening now is that, look, it's just like, uh, there was a story written today by, I think, Chuck Baldwin, and he's quoting the, uh, Spokane County Sheriff Ozzie, uh, what, Nesevich or something?
[02:02:52.822 --> 02:02:59.106]  Showing hands on his hips, standing on the top of the Don't Tread on Me or the Gaston Flag, the title, Daring to Tread.
[02:02:59.507 --> 02:03:02.589]  And he's making the statement, Alex, what you and I have warned about.
[02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:04.470]  You brought it out first on the Mayak Report.
[02:03:05.010 --> 02:03:13.198]  The sheriff and at least one of his deputies have verbalized opinions that constitutionalists are threats to the sheriff's office, the federal government, and to the country itself.
[02:03:13.679 --> 02:03:18.623]  He went so far as to compare constitutionalists with a Sunni Muslim terror group, ISIS.
[02:03:19.204 --> 02:03:25.010]  Now, again, I talked years and years ago, you probably heard me say this, identify, vilify, nullify, destroy.
[02:03:25.610 --> 02:03:27.953]  Okay, we're in the identification.
[02:03:28.274 --> 02:03:29.415]  We're in the vilification.
[02:03:29.575 --> 02:03:29.976]  That's right.
[02:03:29.996 --> 02:03:32.299]  They've been secretly gearing up to come after us.
[02:03:32.339 --> 02:03:39.307]  Now they're getting ready to roll out, which is... I mean, you talk about giving the sheriff's deputies a mission that's not going to end too well.
[02:03:39.608 --> 02:03:40.309]  This is crazy.
[02:03:41.730 --> 02:03:45.851]  Yeah, and you know, they can't even quote where you live or whoever they're complaining about.
[02:03:45.911 --> 02:03:49.093]  You know, the point being is that this is the attitude.
[02:03:49.113 --> 02:03:51.193]  So here's what I want to make people understand.
[02:03:51.673 --> 02:03:54.694]  The American people still believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[02:03:55.115 --> 02:03:58.496]  Those of us who still believe in the living God know there's right and wrong.
[02:03:58.856 --> 02:04:11.100]  But in the age of what I call relativistic takedown of the country, Alex, when we hear the head of Planned Parenthood saying they want 50 livers to experiment on, and you know I write about ancient history.
[02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:22.047]  The practices, even of burning babies in the arms of Molech, or sacrificing babies for the Phoenicians on their anchor ropes, that's what they did.
[02:04:22.347 --> 02:04:29.131]  The point is, is that we stood by as a nation, knowing this stuff was going on, and now, where are we at?
[02:04:29.171 --> 02:04:34.815]  We're at a point where we didn't care about human life, and now everyone who didn't care, they're in the sites.
[02:04:34.855 --> 02:04:36.816]  You know, how many of those people that were aborted,
[02:04:37.236 --> 02:04:38.798]  Could have changed everything.
[02:04:39.098 --> 02:04:43.942]  So here's what I think, and I'll be as blunt as I know how and as prescient as I can be.
[02:04:44.362 --> 02:04:47.525]  We are headed for a manufactured World War III.
[02:04:47.966 --> 02:04:53.671]  In order for the New World Order to bring on their messiah, we call him the Antichrist, meaning in place of Jesus Christ.
[02:04:54.111 --> 02:04:57.414]  Jesus said, I came, you received me, not another will come claiming to be me.
[02:04:57.834 --> 02:05:04.100]  Well, this is what the globalists, the Satanists, and you know, it took, it's now coming into your full focus,
[02:05:10.083 --> 02:05:15.745]  Since yesterday's early morning Virginia news shooting, we now know more about the shooter Fester Lee Flanagan.
[02:05:15.925 --> 02:05:21.148]  He exasperated his bosses with his stiff and nervous delivery and by his inability to use a teleprompter.
[02:05:21.328 --> 02:05:25.370]  He was also reprimanded for wearing a President Obama badge during an election report.
[02:05:25.470 --> 02:05:31.552]  In the report, his supervisor writes, this is a clear violation not only of Schertz County policy, but of standard journalistic ethics.
[02:05:31.832 --> 02:05:36.174]  Journalists, and particularly reporters who appear on television, must abide by a different standard.
[02:05:36.354 --> 02:05:39.655]  President Obama responded saying guns are worse than terrorism.
[02:05:39.995 --> 02:05:46.578]  What we know is that the number of people who die from gun-related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism, the president added.
[02:05:46.718 --> 02:05:50.101]  Trump responded by saying, the problem is not guns, it's mental illness.
[02:05:50.321 --> 02:05:53.983]  Which echoes the infamous appearance Alex Jones made on the Piers Morgan Show.
[02:05:54.083 --> 02:05:54.924]  How about Prozac?
[02:05:55.144 --> 02:05:57.146]  You know the number one... Oh, that's a big sponsor, isn't it?
[02:05:57.406 --> 02:05:59.027]  Don't want to talk about the U.S.
[02:05:59.107 --> 02:06:04.631]  number one cause of death is suicide now because they give people suicide mass murder pills!
[02:06:04.871 --> 02:06:07.533]  Check out the video reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:06:07.714 --> 02:06:09.515]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com

[02:07:27.921 --> 02:07:39.690]  It is concentrated herbs and natural organic compounds known to energize the body's natural processes that are blocked by estrogen mimickers and other toxic elements in the food chain.
[02:07:39.870 --> 02:07:44.914]  Super Mel Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com has sold out multiple times in the last three months.
[02:07:45.074 --> 02:07:45.414]  We're good.
[02:08:21.462 --> 02:08:26.605]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:27.105 --> 02:08:29.426]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:31.928 --> 02:08:35.390]  Here's what happens with social engineering.
[02:08:36.290 --> 02:08:38.932]  By successive approximation or incrementalism,
[02:08:39.975 --> 02:08:42.036]  We get conditioned to put up with more and more.
[02:08:42.777 --> 02:08:52.802]  Fluoride in the water, forced inoculations, GMO that sterilizes and kills many of the rodents they feed it to, that farmers won't give their farm animals because they die when they eat it.
[02:08:53.202 --> 02:08:54.303]  The honeybees are dying.
[02:08:54.323 --> 02:08:58.525]  90 plus percent of the nuclear reactors worldwide are leaking.
[02:08:58.565 --> 02:08:59.706]  It's not even news anymore.
[02:09:00.006 --> 02:09:01.847]  They're supposed to be shut down after 30 years.
[02:09:02.167 --> 02:09:03.748]  Most of them are almost 40 years old.
[02:09:04.148 --> 02:09:05.229]  They just don't care.
[02:09:06.601 --> 02:09:24.119]  They're geoengineering, they're telling us that you can't say father and mother, public schools are banning it all over the country, new buildings put in communal bathrooms, where you now walk into one and there's a woman in there and you're like, oh, excuse me, and they go, oh, it's a, it's okay, it's a, I mean, we're just being messed with.
[02:09:24.239 --> 02:09:25.580]  We're being social engineered.
[02:09:25.620 --> 02:09:28.904]  They give Stinger missiles to Al-Qaeda.
[02:09:30.069 --> 02:09:33.192]  And now the French News says they're bracing for terror attacks there.
[02:09:33.372 --> 02:09:38.816]  Meanwhile, they're in the news saying the Pentagon's preparing for war with the Tea Party.
[02:09:40.777 --> 02:09:43.499]  Now, we broke this, you know, the details, the proof, many years ago.
[02:09:43.940 --> 02:09:45.721]  Quell from Sources talked about it before that.
[02:09:46.262 --> 02:09:47.603]  Mark Cornky and so many others.
[02:09:47.663 --> 02:09:50.425]  But people say, when's it all coming?
[02:09:50.665 --> 02:09:52.006]  The New World Order's here.
[02:09:53.727 --> 02:09:54.268]  It's here.
[02:09:55.469 --> 02:09:59.412]  When they blame gun owners for a mass shooting, or they blame the rebel flag for a mass shooting,
[02:10:00.379 --> 02:10:00.779]  It's here.
[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:09.883]  When they're openly selling babies and keeping babies alive and dissecting them, and then it's like, oh, big deal.
[02:10:11.184 --> 02:10:13.105]  Our conscience has been seared.
[02:10:13.745 --> 02:10:14.645]  We've been conditioned.
[02:10:14.805 --> 02:10:22.969]  I myself have just gotten conditioned to where I hear, oh, the major corporations making their employees take chips in their necks to get into work in Europe.
[02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:23.629]  Oh, big deal.
[02:10:24.069 --> 02:10:27.991]  I didn't even cover it on air a month ago when it was in the news, because I knew it was coming 20 years ago.
[02:10:28.311 --> 02:10:28.872]  Now it's here.
[02:10:28.912 --> 02:10:29.352]  I'm like, OK.
[02:10:31.621 --> 02:10:55.032]  You see, so it's just the continued conditioning and then to now have this sheriff who's a microcosm in Spokane, we have this all over the country, getting giant armored vehicles and the news with a straight face goes, because how do they segue from there's no armored vehicles, we're not targeting constitutionalists, to yeah they really are dangerous and bad, they warned this was coming,
[02:10:56.078 --> 02:10:56.699]  It's here now.
[02:10:56.899 --> 02:10:58.240]  The deputy says it's for us.
[02:10:58.820 --> 02:11:00.021]  They say it all over the country.
[02:11:00.842 --> 02:11:03.444]  We say it's bad, so they go, look, see, they are bad.
[02:11:03.885 --> 02:11:10.170]  We need the armored vehicle because they said that we were getting the armored vehicle for them, but we did get it for them because they're bad.
[02:11:10.190 --> 02:11:11.811]  Because they're bad because they're right.
[02:11:12.912 --> 02:11:15.795]  And then he lies about us and says Infowars is death-threatening.
[02:11:18.186 --> 02:11:19.247]  And they're doing this all over the country.
[02:11:19.287 --> 02:11:19.967]  I played the clip yesterday.
[02:11:19.987 --> 02:11:20.807]  I'm not going to play them again.
[02:11:21.408 --> 02:11:26.710]  Where they sit there saying, we have these for the veterans, we have these for the gun owners, we have these for the conservatives.
[02:11:27.230 --> 02:11:30.732]  This is like Hitler saying, we have these for the communists, we have these for the Jews.
[02:11:31.252 --> 02:11:34.954]  We as a political movement, Americana, I'm a liberal.
[02:11:36.535 --> 02:11:37.876]  In the sense of Thomas Jefferson.
[02:11:38.096 --> 02:11:39.196]  I believe in live and let live.
[02:11:40.537 --> 02:11:42.998]  I'm not getting in your business if you don't get in mine.
[02:11:43.018 --> 02:11:46.540]  The problem is, we didn't get in their business, they took over and now they're getting in our business.
[02:11:48.499 --> 02:11:54.681]  And so I'm begging you to realize that we need alarmists like Steve Quayle.
[02:11:56.022 --> 02:11:57.322]  We need to be concerned.
[02:11:57.342 --> 02:12:01.603]  You know, Matt Drudge a year ago said Americans really should have an exit strategy to get out of the country.
[02:12:02.384 --> 02:12:03.564]  On a Twitter, people made fun of that.
[02:12:03.944 --> 02:12:04.824]  The elite are leaving.
[02:12:04.865 --> 02:12:06.865]  It's in the London Guardian, the Associated Press.
[02:12:07.565 --> 02:12:09.086]  I don't know what exactly is coming.
[02:12:10.387 --> 02:12:16.089]  I know that they were in the newspapers last week again and on TV saying, I'm behind the Boston bombing.
[02:12:16.529 --> 02:12:20.570]  My lawyer says I could win a lawsuit, but I don't have time to spend all my energy on that.
[02:12:20.990 --> 02:12:23.931]  I have to just take the hitch, move forward as a vanguard.
[02:12:27.372 --> 02:12:30.532]  But everything is escalating.
[02:12:30.652 --> 02:12:33.473]  I don't know if it's going to trigger next month, next year.
[02:12:33.613 --> 02:12:34.073]  I don't know.
[02:12:34.153 --> 02:12:35.914]  But things are exponential.
[02:12:37.287 --> 02:12:44.370]  And the Democratic Party, with the Republican leadership, has made the decision to be willfully totalitarian and evil.
[02:12:44.911 --> 02:12:48.432]  You get around Democratic Party operatives, not your average Democrat who's a nice person.
[02:12:48.953 --> 02:12:51.454]  And Republicans are nice people too, their leadership's just as bad.
[02:12:51.734 --> 02:12:53.695]  But the Democrats, they're their vanguard.
[02:12:54.575 --> 02:13:03.300]  And when you get around these people, I want Steve Quill's take on this, they are consciously evil, they know they're taking over, they're just a criminal group like ISIS.
[02:13:04.704 --> 02:13:05.844]  That's why they work with ISIS.
[02:13:06.585 --> 02:13:09.585]  They are getting ready for something big.
[02:13:09.605 --> 02:13:25.530]  That's why suddenly communist rallies that have been deactivated to tell us that didn't exist for 20 years are suddenly... I've been in New York, I've been in Europe, I've been in Austin, Texas and other places and people I know have been seeing it too.
[02:13:25.550 --> 02:13:29.511]  And you'll just be at a cafe and communists march by with a hundred red flags.
[02:13:32.072 --> 02:13:32.212]  And
[02:13:34.167 --> 02:13:38.689]  Suddenly, devil worshippers are showing up everywhere at Planned Parenthood, worshipping, killing babies.
[02:13:39.450 --> 02:13:48.734]  I mean, you've seen it with us show up, and these people literally crawl out from under rocks and just start saying, I'm ugly, I'm fat, Satan, kill, babies, ahhh!
[02:13:48.814 --> 02:13:55.417]  And in the State House, they're just women dressed in normal dresses, just spontaneously.
[02:13:55.477 --> 02:13:58.419]  News talk, they didn't know each other, they were just drawn like zombies.
[02:14:00.199 --> 02:14:04.280]  Like spirits to just go, hail Satan, Satan, and drown out prayer meetings.
[02:14:04.861 --> 02:14:10.923]  Women just came out of their offices and like zombies went downtown, didn't know why they were there, just Satan, Satan, Satan.
[02:14:11.823 --> 02:14:16.364]  And I'm realizing when I sit back and I look at this, I go, what is this?
[02:14:16.685 --> 02:14:17.725]  It's like a movie.
[02:14:18.885 --> 02:14:20.586]  It's like we got possessed or something.
[02:14:20.806 --> 02:14:23.667]  And then those of us that see it and don't like it,
[02:14:24.943 --> 02:14:27.305]  They go, oh, you're a terrorist, you're going to kill people.
[02:14:27.886 --> 02:14:28.967]  We've got to arrest you.
[02:14:28.987 --> 02:14:31.809]  And then we get official re-education camp manuals.
[02:14:31.849 --> 02:14:33.150]  Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com.
[02:14:33.190 --> 02:14:35.052]  I apologize for ranting for five minutes.
[02:14:35.412 --> 02:14:37.014]  Go ahead to the break, six minutes away.
[02:14:37.995 --> 02:14:38.956]  What do you say to that?
[02:14:39.136 --> 02:14:40.017]  Who are the players?
[02:14:40.097 --> 02:14:40.917]  What is the end game?
[02:14:41.178 --> 02:14:42.239]  You were saying it's spiritual.
[02:14:42.998 --> 02:14:48.939]  Right, it's spiritual because, you know, I've written about Stargates, and by the way, I just want to tell people this.
[02:14:49.019 --> 02:14:50.760]  It's important to what we're talking about, Alex.
[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:57.261]  We've uploaded, for a subscription, you can download it, pay to download it, the DVD, True Legends.
[02:14:57.361 --> 02:15:06.263]  And why this is critical, okay, is it's really critical for people to understand that, and one of the revelations in that, and it's shown amazing, 90 minutes,
[02:15:07.023 --> 02:15:21.736]  We actually believe now that through some pretty amazing genius-level mathematicians and Tim Alboreno being down with the film crew and, you know, South American stuff, we actually believe we have found the fallen angel's linguistics.
[02:15:22.396 --> 02:15:27.601]  And I'll let people go on it and see it, but what's going to be important, let me tell you why this is important.
[02:15:28.101 --> 02:15:37.225]  Because the spiritual nature of the battle, when the Satanists come out, you know, during World War II, you and I did a show, I don't know, 10 years ago about this one, I wrote a book called Breathe No Evil.
[02:15:37.726 --> 02:15:47.470]  But Dr. Ishii, I-S-H-I, and Unit 731, were tried for war crimes for the life of vivisections on human beings.
[02:15:47.810 --> 02:15:56.154]  By the way, that's why the Chinese, one of the main reasons the Chinese hate the Japanese so much, the atrocities under Japan were just horrific.
[02:15:56.395 --> 02:15:57.055]  So China,
[02:15:57.455 --> 02:15:58.396]  We're good to go.
[02:16:18.065 --> 02:16:25.407]  All of the, if you will, baby parts in all the lists of the food companies and everything, you can understand something.
[02:16:25.427 --> 02:16:28.008]  They want us changed at a genetic level.
[02:16:28.468 --> 02:16:39.711]  They want us so isolated and so non-human that all of the normal God-given qualities of compassion, of love, of understanding, of forgiveness, they don't want that, okay?
[02:16:39.731 --> 02:16:41.652]  They want a totalitarian hellhole.
[02:16:42.032 --> 02:16:42.893]  Back to the United States.
[02:16:43.153 --> 02:16:45.614]  What was the name of the survey that you and I broke on air?
[02:16:45.994 --> 02:16:47.515]  I sent you an email, we talked about it.
[02:16:47.535 --> 02:16:51.517]  Remember the one that showed the population of America taking down to 80, 90 million?
[02:16:51.637 --> 02:16:52.337]  Absolutely!
[02:16:52.397 --> 02:16:53.638]  That was put out by the government.
[02:16:53.798 --> 02:17:00.841]  And expanding on this, whether we believe in all this or not, the elites believe in the angels, the stargates, the occult.
[02:17:00.881 --> 02:17:03.383]  They believe they're getting their power from it.
[02:17:03.483 --> 02:17:09.426]  And regardless, with the chimeras, with the cross-species creations, with baby brains put in rats,
[02:17:10.367 --> 02:17:12.330]  With octopuses crossed with humans.
[02:17:12.410 --> 02:17:14.232]  All this is being done in labs, admitted now.
[02:17:14.893 --> 02:17:16.235]  These are new creatures.
[02:17:16.275 --> 02:17:19.079]  They're creating aliens right here on this planet.
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:25.464]  Yes they are, and you see, the reason for that is God created mankind in His image and likeness.
[02:17:25.524 --> 02:17:43.877]  People can argue about it, but all the creative genius, all the magnificent things, and there have been magnificent things that men, in their honor of God, look at this, they kicked God out, no prayer in school, now they kick God out of everything, the universities, which most even Christians send their kids to.
[02:17:43.897 --> 02:17:46.739]  Now they say, don't say mother or father, now they say purple penguin.
[02:17:47.327 --> 02:17:47.868]  Right.
[02:17:47.928 --> 02:17:52.811]  Well, our children are trying to be taught to choose sexuality at four years old.
[02:17:52.892 --> 02:17:58.476]  Vladimir Putin and his young wolves are, you know, stripping AK-47s blindfolded.
[02:17:58.976 --> 02:18:02.219]  ISIS is teaching, and I'm not in favor... That's right, that's right, that's right.
[02:18:02.259 --> 02:18:06.663]  They're teaching seven-year-olds how to strip AK-47s blindfolded and march in the snow.
[02:18:07.183 --> 02:18:09.285]  Our four-year-olds are learning how to give a blowjob.
[02:18:10.342 --> 02:18:14.685]  Absolutely, and I'm sorry it has to be stated that way, but here's the deal.
[02:18:14.745 --> 02:18:17.186]  Yeah, I apologize too, but that's what they're teaching five-year-olds.
[02:18:17.826 --> 02:18:19.648]  Yep, they are, and see, here's the thing.
[02:18:20.428 --> 02:18:32.195]  Human sexuality, and boy, we could do a show on that, and I promise you a different take, and it wouldn't be X-rated, but the problem with human sexuality has been taken over by the, I would say this,
[02:18:32.575 --> 02:18:35.137]  The fallen angel perverts.
[02:18:35.217 --> 02:18:37.038]  And you know, I document all this stuff.
[02:18:37.379 --> 02:18:58.914]  By the way, one of the most astonishing revelations coming from 1545 was the fact that God himself sent an angel to sway, you know, the, and I'm going to say this, the homosexual giants and the 1545 to 1600 chroniclers absolutely, you know, said this was a given fact.
[02:18:59.154 --> 02:19:01.196]  Even the Native Americans who are non-
[02:19:01.696 --> 02:19:02.357]  We're good to go.
[02:19:21.858 --> 02:19:22.679]  We're good to go.
[02:19:48.857 --> 02:19:49.238]  I hear you.
[02:19:49.258 --> 02:20:00.149]  Listen, it's really far out, but when you read the Old Testament, it describes these giants coming out of flying saucers raping everybody, and then now you see the elite trying to cross-species everybody.
[02:20:00.650 --> 02:20:03.893]  Whether people think it's real or not, it's manifesting now.
[02:20:04.214 --> 02:20:05.815]  Why do we have legends about this?
[02:20:06.156 --> 02:20:09.620]  Maybe this isn't a good idea to be teaching kids they're purple penguins.

[02:24:15.285 --> 02:24:17.367]  Steve Quell's on about geopolitical issues.
[02:24:17.407 --> 02:24:19.029]  He's super on target with those.
[02:24:19.089 --> 02:24:22.252]  He gets into a lot of wild stuff, investigates archaeological sites.
[02:24:22.972 --> 02:24:23.673]  It's really interesting.
[02:24:23.713 --> 02:24:27.657]  True Legends, the documentary film series, available on DVD or for download.
[02:24:27.677 --> 02:24:28.718]  And it's really professional.
[02:24:30.099 --> 02:24:30.560]  And I've seen it.
[02:24:30.620 --> 02:24:31.400]  It's pretty amazing.
[02:24:32.001 --> 02:24:33.382]  Available at stevequell.com.
[02:24:33.643 --> 02:24:34.583]  That's another show.
[02:24:35.504 --> 02:24:36.065]  Entirely.
[02:24:36.225 --> 02:24:36.765]  I know this.
[02:24:36.826 --> 02:24:39.989]  The whole Promethean legend, the movie Prometheus,
[02:24:40.569 --> 02:24:46.274]  Time Magazine even reports that most genetic engineers and others believe that we were seeded from space now.
[02:24:47.235 --> 02:24:50.879]  They've abandoned the theory of evolution as it's promoted.
[02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:53.841]  I don't go where I can't prove stuff.
[02:24:53.981 --> 02:24:59.006]  I have army manuals admitting they're trying to put us in FEMA camps that are at army.mil.
[02:25:00.207 --> 02:25:03.350]  And I can have Nightline here and hand them the document and they just won't look at it.
[02:25:03.971 --> 02:25:06.052]  The public listening can't believe that, so
[02:25:07.170 --> 02:25:11.736]  But I know I've studied Aztec, Mayan, Mesoamerican culture.
[02:25:12.678 --> 02:25:17.043]  They believe that gods came from the heavens and seated us here.
[02:25:17.484 --> 02:25:19.767]  The elites believe it, the Egyptians, others.
[02:25:20.769 --> 02:25:23.753]  And I know that it's skull and bones and Bohemian Grove and the occult.
[02:25:24.781 --> 02:25:29.443]  That they believe that they are channeling goddesses and entities from other dimensions.
[02:25:29.923 --> 02:25:31.544]  They believe they're doing that at CERN.
[02:25:31.904 --> 02:25:33.745]  They believe they're going to find the God particle.
[02:25:33.785 --> 02:25:51.613]  So whether it's real or not, I don't think we can criticize Steve Quill for looking into it, because when you ask what is the elite main agenda, it is to be God, and they have been splicing humans with cows, pigs, you name it, to grow babies in utero for organ harvesting of larger humanoids.
[02:25:52.293 --> 02:26:00.795]  Then they argue that the humanoid has no rights because it's part bovine or part porcine pig or part pinniped.
[02:26:00.835 --> 02:26:02.976]  They've put them in seals as well.
[02:26:03.316 --> 02:26:06.597]  And look, I talk about this 16, 17, 18, 19 years ago.
[02:26:06.937 --> 02:26:07.657]  People didn't believe it.
[02:26:07.857 --> 02:26:10.158]  It was in industry papers then.
[02:26:11.038 --> 02:26:12.098]  Now it's mainstream news.
[02:26:12.158 --> 02:26:14.399]  I mean, I talk about spider goats 20 years ago.
[02:26:14.479 --> 02:26:16.699]  Before it was in the news, people thought I was a liar.
[02:26:17.139 --> 02:26:19.340]  But then for like 18 years, it's been in the news.
[02:26:20.180 --> 02:26:22.741]  Goats that are part spider that produce body armor and their milk.
[02:26:23.441 --> 02:26:26.122]  So if that's not alien, I don't know what is.
[02:26:26.822 --> 02:26:41.388]  We live on a planet who knows what's going on, but Steve, we're going to come back and take phone calls, get into the economy, geopolitics, Donald Trump, other things that are closer to home, but the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:26:45.663 --> 02:26:51.626]  For your question, specifically your comment for Steve Quayle.
[02:26:51.646 --> 02:26:51.926]  800-259-9231.
[02:26:52.306 --> 02:26:53.747]  Wide open phones and free for all.
[02:26:54.147 --> 02:26:58.969]  But in the 3-4 minutes we have to break, currently geopolitically, Russia, China, the U.S.
[02:27:00.310 --> 02:27:06.932]  Aren't they just different power blocks played off against each other, but with the same globalist operatives in quasi-control of all three?
[02:27:07.752 --> 02:27:14.433]  Right, probably that's true, but people can't identify a supernatural, if you will, brilliance orchestrating evil.
[02:27:14.874 --> 02:27:16.994]  Now, I deal in that whole statement.
[02:27:17.154 --> 02:27:21.055]  Obviously, the Illuminati is going to say we were seeded by aliens.
[02:27:21.075 --> 02:27:22.775]  That's called Banspermia.
[02:27:23.136 --> 02:27:26.196]  The Vatican is getting ready to baptize aliens.
[02:27:26.536 --> 02:27:29.057]  Where I differ from all those guys is this.
[02:27:29.637 --> 02:27:41.482]  Well, it's easy for them to claim the Anunnaki, name them whatever, the gods, actually the Pentagon's called, I think the Pentagon's official name for them is the Sumerian gods.
[02:27:41.662 --> 02:27:45.084]  All those things are fallen angels masquerading as something.
[02:27:45.504 --> 02:27:46.525]  The Bible's very clear.
[02:27:46.685 --> 02:27:52.908]  I believe that, you know, obviously God created Adam and Eve, not, you know, somebody from the planet Antares.
[02:27:54.288 --> 02:28:09.938]  In order to deceive, in order to seduce, in order to destroy, the fallen angels have perpetrated, have populated the planet, and even all the Mesoamericans record it, Native Americans record, the star people.
[02:28:10.359 --> 02:28:15.022]  So what greater lie, and I tell people this Alex, when people say, why won't they
[02:28:15.482 --> 02:28:17.363]  Talk about all the giants that are found.
[02:28:17.443 --> 02:28:19.104]  Why do they hide the bones?
[02:28:19.184 --> 02:28:28.750]  Why do they hide all of the evidence, Steve, that you and the ancient writers... I'm not ancient yet, but I will obviously become ancient sometime.
[02:28:29.371 --> 02:28:31.232]  The idea is simply this, Alex.
[02:28:31.332 --> 02:28:33.913]  It's the greatest deception in the history of the universe.
[02:28:34.334 --> 02:28:38.256]  If someone says the aliens created mankind, I said, then who created the aliens?
[02:28:38.696 --> 02:28:54.316]  You see because the law first mentioned so what I'm trying to get people to understand is is that we're seeing the Pope show up on the 23rd of September and the Vatican Tom Horne has done an amazing job of you know basically writing out the Vatican's own
[02:28:54.816 --> 02:28:56.738]  So, look at the attack on Jesus.
[02:28:56.818 --> 02:28:59.080]  Anything is fair game, and you know this.
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:02.263]  See, the spiritual realm is coming into the visible physical realm.
[02:29:19.660 --> 02:29:20.201]  Well sure.
[02:29:37.142 --> 02:29:37.322]  Yes.
[02:29:37.702 --> 02:29:38.343]  I mean, I know this.
[02:29:38.623 --> 02:29:48.587]  I mean, even if you were an atheist, if I was an atheist, which I'm not, researching this, I would discover the elite believe they are being influenced by interdimensional creatures that give them special knowledge to be in control.
[02:29:48.608 --> 02:29:53.170]  And then you see how the eugenicists came up with all these plans 160 years ago.
[02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:55.811]  It is not of this world, as the Bible says.
[02:29:56.371 --> 02:29:57.472]  It's devilish.
[02:29:57.512 --> 02:29:58.652]  I mean, it's the only way to describe it.
[02:29:59.553 --> 02:30:00.453]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.953 --> 02:30:02.554]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.475 --> 02:30:06.156]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.177 --> 02:30:15.841]  Since yesterday's early morning Virginia News shooting, we now know more about the shooter Vester Lee Flanagan.
[02:30:16.022 --> 02:30:21.286]  He exasperated his bosses with his stiff and nervous delivery, and by his inability to use a teleprompter.
[02:30:21.426 --> 02:30:25.449]  He was also reprimanded for wearing a President Obama badge during an election report.
[02:30:25.589 --> 02:30:31.652]  In the report, his supervisor writes, this is a clear violation not only of Schertz County policy, but of standard journalistic ethics.
[02:30:31.932 --> 02:30:36.273]  Journalists, and particularly reporters who appear on television, must abide by a different standard.
[02:30:36.454 --> 02:30:39.755]  President Obama responded saying guns are worse than terrorism.
[02:30:40.095 --> 02:30:46.658]  What we know is that the number of people who die from gun-related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism, the president added.
[02:30:46.818 --> 02:30:54.041]  Trump responded by saying, the problem is not guns, it's mental illness, which echoes the infamous appearance Alex Jones made on the Piers Morgan Show.
[02:30:54.241 --> 02:30:55.021]  How about Prozac?
[02:30:55.242 --> 02:30:57.203]  You know the number one... Oh, that's a big sponsor, isn't it?
[02:30:57.483 --> 02:30:59.124]  Don't want to talk about the U.S.
[02:30:59.204 --> 02:31:04.727]  number one cause of death is suicide now because they give people suicide mass murder pills!
[02:31:04.947 --> 02:31:07.629]  Check out the video reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:31:07.809 --> 02:31:09.590]  Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:14.934]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[02:31:48.038 --> 02:31:51.180]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.

[02:31:54.822 --> 02:31:56.503]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:31:56.783 --> 02:31:57.703]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:31:57.723 --> 02:31:58.644]  It doesn't have garbage in it.

[02:33:05.243 --> 02:33:06.143]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:06.183 --> 02:33:07.605]  Because there is a war on.
[02:33:07.625 --> 02:33:08.105]  For your mind.
[02:33:33.559 --> 02:33:41.463]  You know, there's only a few herbs out there that even the FDA admits is a treatment for prostate problems.
[02:33:42.304 --> 02:33:43.884]  Enlarged prostate, things like that.
[02:33:44.465 --> 02:33:45.485]  And that's saw palmetto.
[02:33:47.406 --> 02:33:51.769]  And we set out at InfoWarsLife.com to just create an entire line.
[02:33:51.789 --> 02:33:53.269]  We've got like 15 products now.
[02:33:53.289 --> 02:33:55.991]  A couple of them aren't here yet, but they're in the pipeline.
[02:33:57.202 --> 02:34:03.144]  That just has stronger dosages, organic, highest quality, and then fuses in the latest research.
[02:34:04.164 --> 02:34:18.309]  And Prostagard, what has like 10 different ingredients, saw palmetto, lycopene, that's what supercharges the saw palmetto, a lot of evidence says it's even better than that, plant sterols, zinc, vitamin D3, selenium, copper, and other key compounds.
[02:34:19.426 --> 02:34:31.230]  It's back in, very popular, because similar formulas are $29.95, $34.95 or more for just saw palmetto or the lycopene.
[02:34:32.210 --> 02:34:36.812]  We put it all together in one pill, and I take it a couple times a week.
[02:34:36.932 --> 02:34:39.433]  There's so many pills now, but I'm trying to get in the habit.
[02:34:41.179 --> 02:34:43.680]  It's really just fused together with everything else I'm doing.
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:49.201]  I'm 41, and look, if it's helping your prostate, it's going to be helping other stuff as well.
[02:34:50.101 --> 02:34:52.461]  And that's one of the number one problems men have.
[02:34:52.501 --> 02:34:55.782]  It's one of the biggest problems with dysfunction and things like that.
[02:34:55.802 --> 02:34:59.882]  I don't have any of those problems, but boy, has my life gotten better overall.
[02:35:00.823 --> 02:35:07.944]  I mean, occasionally, I'm going to have a medical checkup, I'm fine, but you know, your prostate burns.
[02:35:07.964 --> 02:35:08.924]  Every once in a while, you'll
[02:35:10.083 --> 02:35:13.024]  I mean, we're adults here, we're talking about it.
[02:35:13.784 --> 02:35:16.945]  You take this stuff, I mean, I'll tell you, it might have happened once a month to me.
[02:35:17.625 --> 02:35:24.027]  I've been on Prostagard for about a year, even before we had it out, I was taking what our formula was, and it just has changed a lot of things.
[02:35:24.387 --> 02:35:26.927]  Because these plants are so key, and our bodies need them.
[02:35:27.228 --> 02:35:28.748]  That's where the idea of drugs comes from.
[02:35:28.828 --> 02:35:30.008]  Pharmacy is from plants.
[02:35:30.888 --> 02:35:32.569]  That's what aspirin or any of this stuff does.
[02:35:33.049 --> 02:35:34.069]  And it's just right there.
[02:35:34.149 --> 02:35:36.170]  So, if you're not taking Prostagard,
[02:35:37.421 --> 02:35:38.707]  I mean, I think women ought to take it.
[02:35:38.747 --> 02:35:40.917]  I mean, it's just good for your glands, period.
[02:35:41.878 --> 02:35:44.099]  And I think it does a lot more than what they say.
[02:35:45.100 --> 02:35:51.442]  So Prostagard is available at InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:35:51.843 --> 02:35:59.526]  Luke in Waco, Texas says, Alex team, two days with dramatic improvement with urine flow and reduction of night time visits to the bathroom.
[02:35:59.766 --> 02:36:00.967]  Yeah, when it swells up it does that.
[02:36:01.607 --> 02:36:02.607]  6X to 1X.
[02:36:03.408 --> 02:36:05.129]  Am completely satisfied.
[02:36:05.489 --> 02:36:06.369]  And completely satisfied.
[02:36:06.449 --> 02:36:07.149]  Thank you, Luke.
[02:36:08.290 --> 02:36:09.591]  And yeah, that's the other issue is
[02:36:11.127 --> 02:36:16.089]  When my prostate has flared up, which is very rare, you've got to get up and go to the bathroom every hour.
[02:36:16.109 --> 02:36:18.670]  I mean, this is just what it does.
[02:36:19.411 --> 02:36:21.492]  And you know, guys, we can talk about it as part of our body.
[02:36:23.052 --> 02:36:25.153]  The plant God gave us is the answer.
[02:36:26.474 --> 02:36:28.335]  And so, I kick myself.
[02:36:28.355 --> 02:36:30.055]  I've got a lazy Susan now.
[02:36:30.075 --> 02:36:30.956]  Oh, that's politically incorrect.
[02:36:31.687 --> 02:36:31.947]  Let's go!
[02:36:48.527 --> 02:36:50.908]  The Prostagard Supramel Vitality is back in.
[02:36:50.948 --> 02:36:53.308]  You can buy two, get two free on the Silver Bullet.
[02:36:53.368 --> 02:36:57.590]  Now's the time to stock up on high quality colloidal silver with the winter months coming up especially.
[02:36:58.070 --> 02:37:08.292]  And it also helps fund this operation, so I want to salute you and thank you all for supporting InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, and of course InfoWarsHealth.com.
[02:37:08.552 --> 02:37:13.874]  The entire spectrum of longevity products discounted with free shipping when you sign up for
[02:37:15.592 --> 02:37:15.932]  I think so.
[02:37:35.154 --> 02:37:36.414]  And you remember the scientific name.
[02:37:36.454 --> 02:37:37.515]  I did a whole video on it.
[02:37:37.575 --> 02:37:39.375]  Secret of Prometheus movie revealed.
[02:37:39.976 --> 02:37:41.036]  Transpermia?
[02:37:41.456 --> 02:37:44.777]  What's the term that scientists use?
[02:37:44.997 --> 02:37:46.137]  Panspermia.
[02:37:47.758 --> 02:37:55.160]  So I can show all of them saying this, so then you don't sound like you're crazy for people.
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:57.861]  Because regardless, this is what the elite believe.
[02:37:57.901 --> 02:38:00.482]  But I want to segue out of it in a moment, but go ahead and finish up with that.
[02:38:01.351 --> 02:38:02.652]  Well, yeah, panspermia.
[02:38:02.772 --> 02:38:08.075]  And the whole thing is, Alex, is that, you know, whenever you want to do a show on it, I would welcome that.
[02:38:08.496 --> 02:38:13.459]  Because what's tragic is, is that people somehow can't put two and two together.
[02:38:13.839 --> 02:38:22.385]  If I'm some guy in the 20, you know, first century talking about this stuff, there are so many accounts in ancient history.
[02:38:22.705 --> 02:38:23.285]  I don't know.
[02:38:38.550 --> 02:38:42.031]  They are absolutely bent on one thing.
[02:38:42.051 --> 02:38:44.551]  They must destroy the Christians.
[02:38:45.151 --> 02:38:45.811]  Look at this.
[02:38:46.152 --> 02:38:50.792]  ISIS could have been stopped on their four-mile march of all the U.S.
[02:38:50.812 --> 02:38:51.092]  stuff.
[02:38:51.413 --> 02:38:55.433]  Why has the United States and Britain been supplying ISIS with weapons?
[02:38:55.813 --> 02:39:00.594]  And we've seen the pictures of it in the C-130s dropping equipment.
[02:39:00.614 --> 02:39:02.235]  But here's one thing I want to share.
[02:39:02.255 --> 02:39:03.375]  I was contacted by a C-130 pilot.
[02:39:04.575 --> 02:39:33.904]  Last summer and the summer before, people were noticing in all parts that are really remote, whether Colorado, Montana, Washington, and I'm talking about a C-130 training pilot said this, he said, Steve, all the C-130s that you are seeing, even some landing on highways, abandoned airstrips, their primary goal is only one thing, and that's to supply the foreign troops making war with the patriots and the veterans when they decide it's time.
[02:39:34.484 --> 02:39:37.745]  Now again, since when is a constitution a hate document?
[02:39:37.765 --> 02:39:43.668]  The answer to that is when you've got a communist and a Muslim controlling everything that is being done in this country.
[02:39:44.008 --> 02:39:46.369]  What most people don't understand is this.
[02:39:46.749 --> 02:39:52.651]  The anchor babies is more than just a problem of Latin Americans and South Americans.
[02:39:53.012 --> 02:40:03.816]  What you're seeing is the complete dissolution of the middle class and all their assets and all their fruits of their labor, their life, their inheritance being transferred
[02:40:04.256 --> 02:40:11.663]  Courtesy of the federal betrayers into the hands of illegals, into the hands of those who have been released.
[02:40:11.743 --> 02:40:24.595]  Alex, you and I talked years ago, years ago, about the ultimate prislam, and that's the Islam in the prisons, and I had a very high-ranking Texas guy email me and said,
[02:40:25.516 --> 02:40:27.217]  The plan is to release them all.
[02:40:27.237 --> 02:40:28.877]  Someone said, ah, you're crazy, Quayle.
[02:40:28.897 --> 02:40:29.817]  You're crazy, Jones.
[02:40:29.937 --> 02:40:30.197]  Oh, yeah?
[02:40:30.357 --> 02:40:32.078]  Well, we've already seen it done.
[02:40:32.398 --> 02:40:36.419]  How many hardened criminals have been turned loose?
[02:40:36.439 --> 02:40:42.781]  Imagine... Obama just came out two weeks ago and said he wants to start releasing criminals out of prisons, which sounds like some peace initiative.
[02:40:42.841 --> 02:40:48.182]  No, it's further destabilized, because as whacked out as all this sounds, the border is wide open.
[02:40:48.222 --> 02:40:49.483]  They are trying to destabilize.
[02:40:49.523 --> 02:40:50.503]  I want to go to phone calls.
[02:40:51.003 --> 02:40:53.324]  What do you see as the timetable?
[02:40:53.945 --> 02:41:00.157]  Not so much the actual time on the table, but what is the cascade of events that you think they're preparing?
[02:41:00.748 --> 02:41:04.229]  Well, I think, first of all, they fired their first shot on the 23rd of August.
[02:41:04.249 --> 02:41:06.510]  Remember, we've all been told the 23rd of September?
[02:41:07.010 --> 02:41:08.510]  Everything is in motion now.
[02:41:08.630 --> 02:41:18.393]  What my concern is, my concern is, is that, that they will actually use, the terrorists will use nuclear weapons that have been provided for them on the desert southwest.
[02:41:18.493 --> 02:41:25.256]  Without going into detail, with your permission, Alex, I'll send Nico an email to pass on to you.
[02:41:25.276 --> 02:41:25.936]  You can check it.
[02:41:25.976 --> 02:41:27.296]  I don't want to speak it on the air.
[02:41:27.696 --> 02:41:29.597]  But the thing that's important is this.
[02:41:30.317 --> 02:41:38.559]  Is that when people finally understand that terrorism is a well-financed army, and let's call it what it is, the army of the Antichrist.
[02:41:39.259 --> 02:41:41.140]  A shadow army, a proxy army.
[02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:42.420]  Yes, a proxy.
[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:43.460]  That's even a better word.
[02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:45.761]  The proxy army of the Antichrist.
[02:41:45.901 --> 02:41:49.162]  Do you really think they have a hard time coming up with the money to buy anything?
[02:41:49.502 --> 02:41:57.604]  Look, Pakistan has been providing clandestine nukes to the world for pretty much, I don't know, 15 years probably.
[02:41:57.624 --> 02:41:58.384]  I heard you say that.
[02:41:58.404 --> 02:41:58.824]  That's pretty much
[02:42:15.984 --> 02:42:18.385]  There are tens of thousands of pages on my website.
[02:42:18.425 --> 02:42:18.985]  You know it's obvious.
[02:42:19.005 --> 02:42:36.051]  Well, listen, I've talked to a high-level Special Forces commander, and I couldn't get into details, and I don't want to know the classified details, but I was told this a long time ago, that it was from Pakistan, that Saudi Arabia already had them, and that the Iranians had gotten parts from the Russians and others.
[02:42:36.471 --> 02:42:40.012]  They needed a delivery system, but that they have devices, space-based,
[02:42:40.492 --> 02:42:43.176]  But also drone base that can scan through the rock.
[02:42:43.557 --> 02:42:46.121]  They even know the isotopes of the bombs.
[02:42:46.181 --> 02:42:51.109]  And then Iran had three good-sized atomic bombs at least a decade ago.
[02:42:52.117 --> 02:43:07.664]  Absolutely, and they actually exploded one, and then the official lie that came out, ladies and gentlemen, on the Associated Press, sanitized within one hour, and by the way, I went on coast to coast with that story, basically stated that all the seismographs in the world failed.
[02:43:07.704 --> 02:43:14.547]  Now let me make it clear, an earthquake has a total different seismic signature than a nuclear weapon.
[02:43:14.967 --> 02:43:16.508]  Clinton gave it to all of them in 95.
[02:43:45.447 --> 02:43:51.551]  Uh, weapons, you know, again, because they're, they're producing 20, 20 of them a year, okay?
[02:43:51.711 --> 02:43:52.672]  That's what they believe.
[02:43:52.752 --> 02:43:57.594]  Now that's what, you know, they can kind of figure out by centrifuges, tests, all that stuff.
[02:43:58.075 --> 02:44:01.217]  But if you go back 10 years, that's 200 nuclear weapons.
[02:44:01.237 --> 02:44:03.818]  You're talking about strategic capability.
[02:44:04.298 --> 02:44:11.042]  When they talk about launch weight, throw weight, all those missile terms, you know, I, I say this, well, have you guys factored in container weight?
[02:44:11.082 --> 02:44:11.763]  They say, what do you mean?
[02:44:12.523 --> 02:44:19.030]  Pre-positioned containers with medium-range ballistic missiles that the sides fold down and voila!
[02:44:19.430 --> 02:44:21.873]  Have you considered that those are already in the United States?
[02:44:22.273 --> 02:44:24.776]  Well, right now, you know, your sources will tell you the same thing.
[02:44:24.796 --> 02:44:28.500]  They know of at least 16 nuclear weapons unaccounted for in the United States.
[02:44:29.020 --> 02:44:32.421]  So, the point being is, look, we can find this crap.
[02:44:32.781 --> 02:44:49.666]  If they can find Alex Jones and they can see your wristwatch, read it from outer space, if they've got gigapixel cameras that can pick out 50,000 people and identify each individual face, why is it that all the assets that are turned against the American people aren't using international terrorism?
[02:44:49.746 --> 02:44:50.567]  Listen, take the F-22!
[02:44:51.707 --> 02:44:54.828]  They've now proven what was said 15 years ago when they started development.
[02:44:55.208 --> 02:44:56.908]  It's not as good as the F-16.
[02:44:57.248 --> 02:44:58.749]  It's not as good as anything before it.
[02:44:58.869 --> 02:45:00.129]  It is sabotage.
[02:45:00.689 --> 02:45:02.370]  Hundred and something billion dollars.
[02:45:03.250 --> 02:45:04.750]  I mean, we are being sabotaged.
[02:45:04.870 --> 02:45:06.291]  Human flight programs.
[02:45:06.431 --> 02:45:06.851]  NASA.
[02:45:07.391 --> 02:45:13.012]  I had one of the former top NASA astronauts on just two weeks ago and he said, no, I agree.
[02:45:13.312 --> 02:45:14.873]  NASA is being sabotaged.
[02:45:15.213 --> 02:45:17.093]  Human operations are being sabotaged.
[02:45:17.233 --> 02:45:19.594]  America is being sabotaged.
[02:45:20.054 --> 02:45:22.241]  We are under sabotage attack!
[02:45:24.161 --> 02:45:26.482]  Well, and not only that, but here's the thing.
[02:45:27.482 --> 02:45:34.165]  You know, we're talking about an American population taken down in the not-too-distant future by a couple hundred million people.
[02:45:34.205 --> 02:45:39.027]  The only way you can achieve that is through pretty much primarily two delivery systems, weapons systems.
[02:45:39.407 --> 02:45:40.807]  Biological, i.e.
[02:45:40.847 --> 02:45:42.228]  mandatory vaccines.
[02:45:42.288 --> 02:45:44.149]  Everybody used to bust my chops, your chops.
[02:45:44.209 --> 02:45:45.869]  And notice, we're the sickest now.
[02:45:45.889 --> 02:45:47.290]  Yeah, we never had mandatory vaccines.
[02:45:47.330 --> 02:45:48.310]  Now California's doing it.
[02:45:48.590 --> 02:45:49.651]  Now Australia's doing it.
[02:45:50.868 --> 02:45:54.670]  We gotta go to calls here, Steve, but I mean, it is accelerating.
[02:45:54.890 --> 02:45:56.291]  One last thing before we go to calls.
[02:45:56.752 --> 02:46:04.616]  If everybody noticed, the closing down number the other day was 15,666, okay?
[02:46:04.676 --> 02:46:06.558]  I want everyone to look for two numbers.
[02:46:06.678 --> 02:46:08.839]  I want them to look for multiples of 33.
[02:46:09.439 --> 02:46:14.883]  And for instance, there were 66 challenges to NATO and American
[02:46:15.723 --> 02:46:16.704]  We're good to go.
[02:46:31.673 --> 02:46:34.097]  There is no turning it around politically.
[02:46:34.477 --> 02:46:35.799]  My critics will take me on.
[02:46:35.839 --> 02:46:36.620]  They'll say I'm negative.
[02:46:36.700 --> 02:46:37.461]  I'm not negative.
[02:46:37.802 --> 02:46:38.703]  I'm just telling you this.
[02:46:38.863 --> 02:46:46.594]  We've gone too far, and now the race war I warned about 20 years ago, and by the way, I'm doing everything I can to stop it.
[02:46:47.474 --> 02:46:50.895]  By warning both the blacks, the whites, Latinos, everyone.
[02:46:51.155 --> 02:46:54.277]  You're all, we're all being played against each other.
[02:46:54.617 --> 02:46:55.977]  Who's the central command?
[02:46:56.017 --> 02:46:58.158]  But look who are the villains right now.
[02:46:58.658 --> 02:47:04.060]  And you can understand this when anybody says, if you're a Constitutionalist, a Christian,
[02:47:04.740 --> 02:47:14.249]  I'm saying this if they say a veteran, anybody, homeschoolers, whoever they identify the enemy as, they're not playing games.
[02:47:14.489 --> 02:47:17.271]  You are being targeted for elimination.
[02:47:17.572 --> 02:47:19.794]  I don't know how to make it any easier, Alex.
[02:47:20.194 --> 02:47:24.398]  250 vets, 250,000 vets pretty close, have died in the last five years.
[02:47:24.498 --> 02:47:25.579]  So, am I off?
[02:47:25.739 --> 02:47:26.380]  I don't think so.
[02:47:28.246 --> 02:47:31.767]  All I know is we need alarmists, whether you're completely right or completely wrong.
[02:47:31.787 --> 02:47:33.468]  You're obviously a lot more right than wrong.
[02:47:33.508 --> 02:47:34.468]  We need to be upset.
[02:47:34.488 --> 02:47:35.269]  We need to be concerned.
[02:47:35.729 --> 02:47:38.190]  Allen in Washington, D.C., you're on the air.
[02:47:38.270 --> 02:47:38.990]  Thanks for calling.
[02:47:39.010 --> 02:47:43.192]  Hi, Alex and Steve.
[02:47:43.232 --> 02:47:51.455]  My question is about what Steve was saying about the possibility that the Chinese and the Russians could eventually team up against the United States.
[02:47:54.409 --> 02:47:55.530]  Well, I believe they have.
[02:47:55.550 --> 02:47:57.130]  I believe it's obvious they have.
[02:47:57.150 --> 02:47:59.412]  They're now having joint military drills.
[02:47:59.452 --> 02:48:01.153]  They're obviously in the Arctic together.
[02:48:01.913 --> 02:48:07.316]  The Russian, the Brick Nation, I'm sorry, I can't even think of the Brick Nation.
[02:48:07.376 --> 02:48:16.301]  Brazil, Russia, India, China are all ready forming their international money transfer system to compete with the West Swift.
[02:48:16.641 --> 02:48:17.961]  So they're ready to go.
[02:48:17.981 --> 02:48:18.902]  It's interesting.
[02:48:19.002 --> 02:48:20.023]  He's starting to dump U.S.
[02:48:20.083 --> 02:48:20.584]  Treasuries.
[02:48:20.624 --> 02:48:24.529]  I think that signals the dollar is in trouble, even though it's been dominant.
[02:48:25.511 --> 02:48:26.913]  It signals a war is on.
[02:48:28.340 --> 02:48:28.920]  Absolutely.
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:31.742]  So the answer is, they're already here, they're already ready.
[02:48:31.802 --> 02:48:35.364]  And I hope you understood, sir, the caller when I first started talking.
[02:48:35.844 --> 02:48:46.050]  It's already a given that the Chinese, in order to continue to buy America's debt years ago, demanded the disarming of the United States' citizenry.
[02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:51.553]  Even Michelle Obama, what was it, Alex, a couple months ago, said, before my husband leaves office, he's going to take the guns away?
[02:48:51.913 --> 02:48:53.194]  By the way, most people don't understand.
[02:48:53.234 --> 02:48:57.536]  John Kerry, without Senate approval, signed the United Nations Small Arms Convention.
[02:48:57.776 --> 02:48:59.197]  Definitely, they're making their move.
[02:48:59.217 --> 02:49:00.478]  I don't know if they're going to get away with it.
[02:49:00.858 --> 02:49:04.020]  Exposing them, they stop it, then we get blamed for fear-mongering.
[02:49:04.041 --> 02:49:05.201]  We're trying to stop this.
[02:49:05.361 --> 02:49:06.762]  Alan, thank you so much.
[02:49:07.143 --> 02:49:09.244]  James in Canada, you're on the air with Steve Quayle.
[02:49:10.985 --> 02:49:11.826]  Hi guys, thank you.
[02:49:12.366 --> 02:49:14.108]  My question is about the fires.
[02:49:14.248 --> 02:49:18.791]  I'm in southern Alberta and we're getting a ton of smoke coming up from the Washington fires.
[02:49:18.811 --> 02:49:24.155]  Do you think this is part of the chemtrails or part of their agenda to smoke us out or something?
[02:49:24.898 --> 02:49:26.079]  Well, I'll give you the answer to that.
[02:49:26.540 --> 02:49:38.413]  Again, I would encourage you to go on, do a web search for Spetsnaz and also Golitsyn, G-O-L-I-T-S-Y-I-N, or S-Y-I-N.
[02:49:38.793 --> 02:49:41.196]  It is a part of the preparatory
[02:49:41.696 --> 02:49:46.761]  ...events taking place before the Russian and Chinese invasion of the United States.
[02:49:47.181 --> 02:49:59.093]  If the fires are intentionally being set, and that's exactly what a guy, he posted 148 points, 139 points... Well I remember people saying the fires in Russia might have been started by NATO.
[02:49:59.133 --> 02:50:00.494]  NATO's certainly starting a fight.
[02:50:00.794 --> 02:50:04.378]  What about the big chemical explosions at the military base?
[02:50:05.038 --> 02:50:09.240]  Last week in Japan, and then the stuff happening in China.
[02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:12.081]  Some word is they're saying that's environmental terrorists.
[02:50:13.121 --> 02:50:14.182]  Well, I don't believe that.
[02:50:14.222 --> 02:50:16.342]  I believe it's space-based weapons, okay?
[02:50:16.722 --> 02:50:18.023]  Here's the reason I say that.
[02:50:18.383 --> 02:50:21.204]  Tianjiang, and I may be pronouncing it wrong, the same thing.
[02:50:21.564 --> 02:50:22.845]  There's so much payback.
[02:50:22.885 --> 02:50:28.867]  And geoengineering, by the way, is what is directing the normal rain away from the Pacific Northwest.
[02:50:28.887 --> 02:50:33.889]  I have people that live in the Olympic Peninsula, Alex, talking to me about how dry it is there.
[02:50:34.409 --> 02:50:36.990]  Geoengineering is the perfect weapon.
[02:50:37.090 --> 02:50:39.271]  Chemtrails, the perfect weapon.
[02:50:39.511 --> 02:50:56.719]  When we talk about the introduction of a bioweapon across the country or across the world, if the chemical spray, the chemical soup that's already in the air, in our lungs, in our body, in our genes, all they have to do is add, let's say that's part A of the ingredient, part B of the ingredient.
[02:50:56.739 --> 02:50:57.740]  Binary weapons, stay there.
[02:50:58.340 --> 02:50:59.021]  James, thank you.
[02:50:59.041 --> 02:50:59.781]  Great question.
[02:51:00.061 --> 02:51:03.863]  Art, Darren, Adam, Gary, your call straight ahead.
[02:51:03.883 --> 02:51:04.884]  Steve Quell is our guest.
[02:51:05.965 --> 02:51:07.686]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:51:10.327 --> 02:51:16.111]  So I say to Market Lunch, look, you know, I keep hearing from the government that, you know, they're worried someday ISIS may get here.
[02:51:16.471 --> 02:51:21.895]  And I go, duh, Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting, ISIS is already here.
[02:51:22.276 --> 02:51:24.277]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me.
[02:51:24.437 --> 02:51:28.600]  If they don't know ISIS is here already, they got no clue, I'm taking care of myself.
[02:51:28.820 --> 02:51:35.285]  Guns80.com, AR-15 kits, 30 shot magazines, great prices, they've even got the Hillary special.
[02:51:35.345 --> 02:51:36.646]  Guns80.com, that's 844-2Guns80, Guns80.com.
[02:51:40.279 --> 02:51:43.820]  Just recently, we've witnessed some of the most catastrophic disasters in history.

[02:51:50.702 --> 02:51:54.082]  Of course, we're talking about the foods from SurvivalFoodAlliance.com.

[02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:19.183]  Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day and the home security industry wants you to believe that's your only option.
[02:52:19.443 --> 02:52:24.625]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[02:52:24.925 --> 02:52:29.527]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[02:52:29.807 --> 02:52:33.049]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.
[02:52:33.349 --> 02:52:35.409]  But there's a better way to protect your home.
[02:52:35.770 --> 02:52:37.330]  SimpliSafe Home Security.

[02:53:09.716 --> 02:53:14.979]  Many experts are predicting that food prices will surge this year due to the severe drought in California.

[02:54:16.055 --> 02:54:32.882]  There's a graphic at the bottom of the page on InfoWars.com in the political illustration area of Thomas Jefferson and he's saying to compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves in and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.
[02:54:34.443 --> 02:54:36.404]  That's the founder of the Democratic Party saying that.
[02:54:37.597 --> 02:54:44.561]  And that's what they make us do with all the textbooks, the government-run media, the funding of it, is just push all this disinfo.
[02:54:44.961 --> 02:54:47.683]  All I'm trying to do today is get people to think outside the box.
[02:54:49.206 --> 02:54:54.512]  We're going to do five minutes of overdrive so we have time to try to go to at least five or six callers of the folks that are holding.
[02:54:55.393 --> 02:54:59.497]  Have you heard about this guy in New Jersey that got arrested for redirecting red light cameras?
[02:55:00.178 --> 02:55:01.680]  He said, of course, I knew I'd get arrested.
[02:55:01.700 --> 02:55:02.400]  I want to get him on.
[02:55:02.941 --> 02:55:07.866]  Red Light Rebel, how to fight back video gets him arrested, but gets a lot of love too.
[02:55:08.687 --> 02:55:12.551]  The point is, is that he knew he'd win because in that state and others, they're illegal.
[02:55:12.711 --> 02:55:14.993]  It's not a sworn officer writing the summons.
[02:55:15.594 --> 02:55:17.055]  They're all unlawful.
[02:55:17.356 --> 02:55:19.678]  But they still keep putting them up because people don't know and pay.
[02:55:20.599 --> 02:55:25.363]  So it's this type of civil disobedience against criminal government activity that's going to save this country.
[02:55:26.092 --> 02:55:27.592]  So great job, we salute you.
[02:55:28.072 --> 02:55:32.453]  Long Island Man 42 busted for tampering with traffic cameras and posting YouTube.
[02:55:32.693 --> 02:55:34.034]  He said who he was on the video.
[02:55:34.634 --> 02:55:37.415]  He didn't hide it, but they act like he's a criminal, New York Daily News.
[02:55:38.215 --> 02:55:40.535]  Alright, going back to Steve Quayle, we're taking phone calls.
[02:55:41.655 --> 02:55:43.656]  Art in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:55:44.816 --> 02:55:47.337]  Hi, thank you gentlemen.
[02:55:47.377 --> 02:55:52.758]  My question to Steve is prompted by a discussion he had with George Norrie earlier this year.
[02:55:53.490 --> 02:55:54.932]  And it's this, Steve.
[02:55:55.473 --> 02:56:03.523]  Are you still expecting some sort of Planet X appearance event early next year?
[02:56:05.160 --> 02:56:07.421]  Well, I actually expect it.
[02:56:07.481 --> 02:56:08.741]  I think we're seeing it.
[02:56:09.721 --> 02:56:14.742]  We're experiencing the gravitational, the climatic, and the volcanoes.
[02:56:14.962 --> 02:56:22.004]  You know, there's all kinds of pressures, and when I'm talking gravitational pressures and other pressures being placed on there.
[02:56:22.044 --> 02:56:23.164]  So yeah, I think you're seeing it.
[02:56:23.824 --> 02:56:26.925]  I can take anybody back through recorded history and even
[02:56:27.285 --> 02:56:30.331]  Well, there's no doubt that there's hundreds of planets out in the Kuiper Belt.
[02:56:40.825 --> 02:56:43.527]  And so instead of calling them planets, they just delisted Pluto.
[02:56:43.547 --> 02:56:48.932]  There's planets two or three times the size of Pluto out there, and we know that Earth collisions happen a lot often.
[02:56:48.992 --> 02:56:51.814]  I just don't think anybody can tell exactly when that's going to happen.
[02:56:51.834 --> 02:56:53.475]  There's so many amateur astronomers.
[02:56:53.916 --> 02:56:56.037]  I would expect if something gets close, people are going to see it.
[02:56:56.378 --> 02:56:57.138]  But thank you, Art.
[02:56:57.158 --> 02:56:58.139]  Appreciate your call.
[02:56:58.639 --> 02:57:02.182]  Adam, in FEMA Region 4, what former state are you in, sir?
[02:57:02.202 --> 02:57:04.764]  That would be Florida, sir.
[02:57:04.804 --> 02:57:05.345]  How are you doing?
[02:57:05.445 --> 02:57:05.645]  Good.
[02:57:05.685 --> 02:57:05.965]  Go ahead.
[02:57:05.985 --> 02:57:07.747]  Do you have a question or comment for Steve Coyle?
[02:57:08.723 --> 02:57:11.944]  Well, I got so much stuff I'd love to talk about, but I'll be as fast as I can.
[02:57:11.984 --> 02:57:22.966]  Basically, on the chemtrail issue, I was wondering if you think it would be a smart approach to take, basically saying that, listen, the skies are meant to be clear and free of clouds.
[02:57:23.586 --> 02:57:32.388]  Here we have flames that have something coming out of the back, whether it be just a byproduct of the fuel that's combusted in the engine, or something that's added or whatever,
[02:57:32.830 --> 02:57:37.934]  Can't we get environmentalists and liberals to just, you know, say, hey, what's up with all this pollution in the sky?
[02:57:37.954 --> 02:57:39.256]  No, that's the government doing that.
[02:57:39.276 --> 02:57:40.136]  That's good.
[02:57:40.497 --> 02:57:43.399]  Well, let me answer that really quick and really easy.
[02:57:43.759 --> 02:57:46.041]  Go to geoengineeringwatch.org.
[02:57:46.101 --> 02:57:49.604]  As the guy who broke the story about the chemtrails, I can tell you this.
[02:57:49.805 --> 02:57:54.509]  It's not, there's a difference between condensation trails and chemtrails.
[02:57:54.909 --> 02:57:58.952]  Chemicals, aluminum, barium, and also human blood sites, blood cells,
[02:57:59.973 --> 02:58:00.553]  We're good to go.
[02:58:19.724 --> 02:58:20.484]  Stay there Alex!
[02:58:46.377 --> 02:58:46.657]  Hold on.
[02:58:46.737 --> 02:58:47.678]  One more segment, Steve.
[02:58:47.718 --> 02:58:48.079]  Stay there.
[02:58:48.099 --> 02:58:48.579]  Thanks, Adam.
[02:58:48.619 --> 02:58:49.179]  Good question.
[02:58:49.680 --> 02:58:51.341]  We're really getting outside the box today.
[02:58:51.361 --> 02:58:51.882]  Stay with us.
[02:58:52.742 --> 02:58:56.706]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[02:59:30.959 --> 02:59:33.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:59:33.160 --> 02:59:37.881]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:59:38.141 --> 02:59:41.301]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:59:41.441 --> 02:59:44.642]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:59:44.922 --> 02:59:46.722]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:59:46.902 --> 02:59:48.763]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:59:49.003 --> 02:59:50.903]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[03:00:02.515 --> 03:00:07.197]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.699 --> 03:00:18.721]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:19.342 --> 03:00:22.363]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:23.243 --> 03:00:26.224]  By the way, Tropical Storm Erica is battering the Caribbean.
[03:00:26.304 --> 03:00:27.985]  Florida, Bahamas are on alert.
[03:00:30.427 --> 03:00:33.729]  Hurricanes have been down the last decade or so, but now they're back.
[03:00:34.410 --> 03:00:38.913]  But what is definitely out of control is tectonic activity around the world.
[03:00:39.774 --> 03:00:44.618]  And they're saying that California could be seeing a huge one very, very soon.
[03:00:44.638 --> 03:00:47.660]  We're going to be getting some experts on that next week.
[03:00:48.500 --> 03:00:51.202]  Steve Quayle is our guest, stevequayle.com.
[03:00:51.583 --> 03:00:52.703]  Appreciate him joining us today.
[03:00:52.723 --> 03:00:55.385]  We're going as many calls as we can, getting quick comments from Steve.
[03:00:56.786 --> 03:00:58.548]  Darien in Illinois, thanks for holding.
[03:01:00.165 --> 03:01:00.565]  Am I on?
[03:01:00.885 --> 03:01:01.306]  Yes, you are.
[03:01:02.667 --> 03:01:09.931]  I, uh, yeah, I was watching Ancient Aliens the other day and it was talking about the transhumanoid thing that, you know, with the building the cells and all that.
[03:01:10.352 --> 03:01:16.396]  What more can we do to expose the elite plan, you know, because this is just, you know, almost too far-fetched for some people to believe.
[03:01:16.896 --> 03:01:18.077]  Well, listen, I appreciate your call.
[03:01:18.117 --> 03:01:24.701]  People can joke around about this, but they've already created transhuman chimeras that we see about in the old legends.
[03:01:24.721 --> 03:01:26.903]  So whether that was real or not, it's happening now.
[03:01:27.867 --> 03:01:38.114]  And because this has been pre-discredited before, just like there's no black helicopters, there's no world government, the Pope's not calling for world government even when he is, then when this stuff starts to happen people can't believe it.
[03:01:38.374 --> 03:01:46.840]  They're already changing the Earth and attacking the genetic code of the planet, of the creatures on the planet across the board.
[03:01:47.140 --> 03:01:51.063]  This is a very evil plan that isn't helping the elite themselves.
[03:01:51.623 --> 03:01:53.665]  So, Steve Quayle?
[03:01:54.850 --> 03:02:00.214]  Well, Alex, it's a total evil plan, and it's totally from start to finish.
[03:02:00.234 --> 03:02:07.500]  The Book of Revelation, which a lot of people quote but don't want to, you know, put it into perspective, is telling us what the end times are going to be like.
[03:02:08.020 --> 03:02:15.666]  And so the idea that we're dealing with the four horsemen, the apocalypse, famine, look at the whole situation with Fukushima.
[03:02:16.027 --> 03:02:20.070]  A third of the sea life, the Pacific Ocean is actually a third of the sea life.
[03:02:20.410 --> 03:02:25.616]  It's just about dead or dying, yet there's nothing in the mainstream vomit brokers, and it's like it doesn't matter.
[03:02:25.716 --> 03:02:32.964]  Here's what people have got to understand and act and speak out and stand up for what this country is.
[03:02:33.304 --> 03:02:34.446]  They want you dead.
[03:02:34.466 --> 03:02:37.149]  By the way, the name of that report was a Deagle report, okay?
[03:02:37.709 --> 03:02:38.770]  D-E-A-G-L-E.
[03:02:38.850 --> 03:02:44.997]  When you and I put it on, we went out there, then they even had to put all of their caveats, well we really didn't mean it, blah blah blah.
[03:02:45.397 --> 03:02:47.599]  Believe me, that meant what it meant.
[03:02:47.679 --> 03:02:55.787]  So, the population, and you talk about tectonic plate weapons, I quote obviously in the books I've written.
[03:02:55.807 --> 03:02:58.130]  Secretary of Defense Cutler, 1997 Army Times.
[03:02:59.771 --> 03:03:01.131]  I wrote that in Weather Wars.
[03:03:01.151 --> 03:03:03.392]  You have me on your show, by the way, that's available.
[03:03:03.672 --> 03:03:05.533]  Weather Wars, can I tell you something interesting?
[03:03:05.753 --> 03:03:11.215]  Weather Wars is the most important book I ever wrote a decade ago for right now.
[03:03:11.295 --> 03:03:22.119]  When I'm writing about transgenics and transhumanism and everything we're talking about kind of going in the woo-woo area, well the thing is that that's right now happening, but the Weather Wars are ongoing.
[03:03:22.139 --> 03:03:22.400]  285 patents.
[03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:24.440]  Alex, if people seriously read the
[03:03:26.121 --> 03:03:30.684]  I hate to be the one that looks at everything that it's fake or a hoax, but as far as the shooting goes yesterday, I just
[03:03:45.698 --> 03:04:07.569]  When it's the media covering something that happens within the media, it adds multiple layers of deception, and it seems to fit multiple agendas, but I just find it hard to believe that they didn't hear a six-foot-four, 300-pound guy walking on a wood plank deck, and then the reaction from the woman news reporter's boyfriend.
[03:04:08.009 --> 03:04:13.632]  I mean, I wouldn't be able to do an interview if my dog died that day, let alone my wife or my girlfriend.
[03:04:15.194 --> 03:04:16.935]  And I just wanted to know your comments on it.
[03:04:18.016 --> 03:04:20.577]  No, I mean, I don't know what to say.
[03:04:20.617 --> 03:04:24.560]  I mean, they've staged stuff before, so it's not discrediting the question.
[03:04:25.680 --> 03:04:27.281]  But this doesn't fit all their narratives.
[03:04:27.301 --> 03:04:28.042]  What do you think, Steve?
[03:04:28.686 --> 03:04:33.670]  Well, first of all, it was the statement from the shooter himself that he wants to generate a race war.
[03:04:34.191 --> 03:04:39.555]  It's... Alex, again, I'm not wanting that, but the bottom line is they want that.
[03:04:39.676 --> 03:04:43.919]  It has been a plan of the Russians' plan, and I'm not blaming Russians, you know?
[03:04:46.241 --> 03:04:57.310]  Yeah, the bottom line is a globalist, and you've got Vladimir Putin, who, by the way, I respect in the sense that he's at least looking to God as represented by the Russian Orthodox Church.
[03:04:57.330 --> 03:05:01.092]  Sure, you know we're in trouble when Vladimir Putin sounds more liberty-based than who runs our country.
[03:05:01.152 --> 03:05:01.753]  It's amazing.
[03:05:01.853 --> 03:05:02.313]  Absolutely.
[03:05:02.333 --> 03:05:03.474]  Listen, Steve, we're out of time.
[03:05:03.574 --> 03:05:04.355]  Thank you so much.
[03:05:04.395 --> 03:05:05.256]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:05:05.616 --> 03:05:05.976]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:05.996 --> 03:05:06.456]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:05:06.677 --> 03:05:07.037]  Thank you.
[03:05:07.057 --> 03:05:07.757]  Notley News Tonight, 7-7.
[03:05:13.260 --> 03:05:16.602]  Parenthood through the undercover Planned Parenthood video featuring its CEO.
[03:05:17.023 --> 03:05:28.831]  The law prohibits organ and tissue donors from selling for profit, yet solicitation materials from StemExpress repeatedly tout how financially profitable and rewarding and beneficial it can be to the fiscal growth for abortion clinics.
[03:05:29.011 --> 03:05:36.117]  And when asked what they can do to help clinics that aren't profiting, the CEO is astonished and says she doesn't know any who aren't profiting.
[03:05:36.317 --> 03:05:37.738]  You want to say this is about women's health?
[03:05:37.998 --> 03:05:44.303]  She talks about the contamination of samples with staff due to unsanitary clinic conditions being a repeated problem.
[03:05:44.543 --> 03:05:54.311]  And the StemExpress CEO talks about the stigma of delivering butchered baby parts to labs, how they freak out, how they have meltdowns when they get a whole head, how they'll request hands and feet
[03:05:54.571 --> 03:05:55.172]  We're good to go.
