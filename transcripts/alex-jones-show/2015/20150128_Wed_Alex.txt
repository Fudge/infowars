[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.097]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.853]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:21.514 --> 00:00:22.314]  You want answers?
[00:00:23.095 --> 00:00:23.996]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.636 --> 00:00:28.259]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.922]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.843 --> 00:00:42.810]  To show the sick amount of influence that the kleptocratic dictatorship of Saudi Arabia, the royal family has over this country,
[00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:53.033]  It was a big controversy that the First Lady Michelle Obama didn't cover her face when she met with the royal family that Obama constantly bows down to.
[00:00:54.313 --> 00:00:57.054]  Is that not truly sickening, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:00:57.734 --> 00:00:59.675]  That's the top of stories coming up today.
[00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:07.037]  We also have the federal government coming out and warning of the Internet of Things and calling for safeguards
[00:01:08.317 --> 00:01:18.829]  For the quote smart grid that has been engineered at a global level for at least 30 years on record to track and control and tax everything we do.
[00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.816]  The Internet of Things and the smart grid is the carbon tax micromanagement kill grid.
[00:01:26.693 --> 00:01:30.357]  In fact, I'm going to get to that, but I forgot the story from yesterday that came out at the end of the show.
[00:01:30.377 --> 00:01:38.186]  You guys reprint me Watson's article, and I'm going to have it reposted in front of Infowars.com, because it broke at about 1.30 and got no attention.
[00:01:39.227 --> 00:01:41.469]  I think that's the worst time to break a story.
[00:01:42.712 --> 00:01:45.394]  is around that time and we just break them as they come out.
[00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:57.743]  Announced by the British government, they're going to take control of your car, basically remote control it, tax it, track it, reduce the power you have, just like they've announced smart meters are already controlling your thermostat and gouging you.
[00:01:59.124 --> 00:02:07.991]  This is all being announced, just like the new smart light bulbs are going to interface with your television and other appliances and it began two weeks ago.
[00:02:09.577 --> 00:02:12.279]  Suddenly people are noticing that it's taking place.
[00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.180]  The news is like, isn't it fun?
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:23.687]  And the company's just getting data why the television, the new smart TV, interfaces with your light bulbs and sends info back to the company.
[00:02:23.707 --> 00:02:25.248]  I'm going to say that again.
[00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:30.232]  The televisions, without asking, is interfacing with the light bulbs.
[00:02:30.472 --> 00:02:32.894]  You think all this just happened by accident?
[00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:36.877]  That's more ridiculous than the
[00:02:39.363 --> 00:02:43.649]  Purist evolutionists that believe that, you know, cells form by their own.
[00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:49.257]  That's like saying a fine wristwatch formed in the middle of the desert with sand blowing together for enough time.
[00:02:50.865 --> 00:02:52.225]  That's the old cliched answer.
[00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:55.947]  I don't believe in what the mainline preachers extrapolate out of the Bible either.
[00:02:56.067 --> 00:03:07.731]  So I don't believe in what they're saying and their interpretation, and I don't believe the other religionists with their, you know, I came from a chimpanzee, when all the top genetic engineers say that's clearly not what's going on.
[00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:09.511]  There's giant leaps in development.
[00:03:10.051 --> 00:03:12.432]  We're talking just suddenly whole new species, okay?
[00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:17.814]  We were engineered, and you can debate all day long who did the engineering,
[00:03:19.708 --> 00:03:27.274]  Most elite scientists, and I've read New York Times articles, London Guardian articles here on air, who were atheists are now not atheists.
[00:03:28.716 --> 00:03:32.339]  They believe in ceding from space.
[00:03:34.036 --> 00:03:43.920]  And my piece that's got millions of views on YouTube from the nightly news years ago, Secrets of Prometheus Revealed, gets into that.
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.522]  And so when you see a movie like Prometheus, this is a Noah Bible story from the Illuminati.
[00:03:52.243 --> 00:03:55.044]  This is what they really believe happened.
[00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:56.725]  Panspermia.
[00:03:58.134 --> 00:03:58.854]  Meaning all.
[00:03:59.535 --> 00:04:00.375]  Meaning seed.
[00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:10.622]  It's the hypothesis that life exists throughout the universe, distributed by micro-asteroids, comets, planetoids, and also spacecraft in the form of unintended contamination by microorganisms.
[00:04:12.443 --> 00:04:13.744]  No, it's not unintended.
[00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:18.007]  So, I'm not going there.
[00:04:18.107 --> 00:04:18.787]  I'm a Christian.
[00:04:20.248 --> 00:04:21.569]  That's where I stand.
[00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:25.892]  But if you sit there and you just think that
[00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:28.950]  All this just appeared out of nowhere?
[00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.570]  You really are stupid.
[00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.811]  I mean, something's wrong with you.
[00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:34.112]  And that's what the evolutionists say.
[00:04:34.152 --> 00:04:39.734]  They say amino acids in hot water created cells.
[00:04:40.494 --> 00:04:48.338]  The most primitive cell is thousands of times, conservatively, more complex than a fine Swiss rich watch.
[00:04:49.138 --> 00:04:50.999]  A fine Swiss wrist watch.
[00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:51.879]  A timepiece.
[00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:53.440]  Alright, look, look.
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.381]  We've got huge news off the chart coming up.
[00:04:57.617 --> 00:05:01.302]  It was Buckley Hammond that discovered this.
[00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.285]  Paul Watson's done a report on it.
[00:05:04.927 --> 00:05:08.512]  And I was sitting here... Well, I'll tell you when we get back.
[00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:15.057]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:05:15.817 --> 00:05:22.060]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:31.223]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.

[00:05:41.104 --> 00:05:44.626]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:48.748]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:50.509]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:58.413]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:58.693 --> 00:05:59.534]  But for how long?
[00:05:59.834 --> 00:06:06.097]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:06:06.477 --> 00:06:09.279]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:19.213]  What disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time?
[00:06:19.593 --> 00:06:26.176]  NASA has already set the countdown timer, and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[00:06:26.696 --> 00:06:30.140]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.381]  population could perish.
[00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:34.824]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[00:06:35.305 --> 00:06:37.086]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[00:06:37.547 --> 00:06:38.808]  Mass riots will follow.
[00:06:39.188 --> 00:06:40.910]  Ancient diseases will re-emerge.
[00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.914]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?
[00:06:45.454 --> 00:06:51.120]  Go to darkestdays.info to find out proven methods of protecting yourself, your loved ones,

[00:07:00.752 --> 00:07:02.374]  DarkestDays.info.

[00:08:22.594 --> 00:08:28.258]  Drop the hammer.
[00:08:28.278 --> 00:08:36.704]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:37.085 --> 00:08:38.846]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:39.266 --> 00:08:41.808]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:43.529]  That's right.
[00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.392]  And knowing is half the battle.
[00:08:49.978 --> 00:08:53.381]  It is the 28th day already of January 2015.
[00:08:53.461 --> 00:08:58.486]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:08:59.526 --> 00:09:07.894]  We have John Draper joining us, the first and probably greatest hacker of all time, known as Captain Crunch.
[00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.430]  He rarely does interviews.
[00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.892]  He is a listener of the broadcast, as a lot of eccentric people are.
[00:09:15.532 --> 00:09:27.456]  And we're going to be honored to have him to talk about everything from the Sony hack to the NSA to all of these reporters and people being persecuted and put in prison for reporting on WikiLeaks.
[00:09:28.337 --> 00:09:33.798]  He was somebody thrown in prison for exposing what was happening in the Nixon administration.
[00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:37.780]  He was somebody able to hack into the telephones directly into the White House.
[00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:47.880]  Just using common sense, but also he could train himself to whistle the tones, which the CIA and FBI did not even believe he could do.
[00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:58.551]  And then of course he was put in a government facility for years, basically working for them during his prison sentence, doing all sorts of clandestine operations.
[00:09:59.713 --> 00:10:05.298]  So he's going to be joining us, the one, the only, Captain Crunch here on the transmission.
[00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:12.365]  You know, it's kind of like I had Al Jorgensen of Ministry, you know, who is a top, you could say top 15 rock star.
[00:10:13.595 --> 00:10:15.317]  I would say even top ten, maybe top ten.
[00:10:15.597 --> 00:10:17.339]  And sometimes he's been one of the top guys in the country.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.261]  I like the lyrics of the music.
[00:10:19.782 --> 00:10:22.044]  I think he's said a lot of really interesting things over the years.
[00:10:22.184 --> 00:10:25.488]  Obviously, at this point, he's kind of like the crazy uncle in the attic.
[00:10:25.848 --> 00:10:26.629]  But aren't we all?
[00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.094]  And sure, he gets up on air and acts wild and crazy, because he is wild and crazy.
[00:10:31.114 --> 00:10:35.499]  And a minority of people said, man, what are you doing having somebody like this on your show?
[00:10:37.486 --> 00:10:39.507]  Well, I like real people and eccentrics.
[00:10:39.607 --> 00:10:42.327]  It doesn't mean that I endorse everything they believe or stand for.
[00:10:42.928 --> 00:10:54.291]  But I don't like these fake executives in Congress and these fake executives in the British Parliament who are all uptight on the surface and who are molesting little boys and girls at night.
[00:10:57.597 --> 00:11:07.080]  I'm sick of the most corrupt people on their high horse, and to steal a line from Apocalypse Now, Colonel Curse is explaining why he's so sick of the system.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:21.085]  He goes, you know, we kill hundreds of thousands of people, and we drop fiery napalm death on villages, but then they court-martial our airmen for putting cuss words on the sides of their airplanes!
[00:11:22.365 --> 00:11:23.766]  And that's exactly what I'm talking about!
[00:11:23.966 --> 00:11:26.607]  People freak out about the cuss words on the side of an airplane,
[00:11:27.381 --> 00:11:34.524]  But they don't care if the veterans, we now know for a year, this is already going on, we told you here over and over again.
[00:11:34.544 --> 00:11:36.384]  I'm not bragging, we just know the paradigm.
[00:11:36.405 --> 00:11:37.765]  We know what we're talking about.
[00:11:37.785 --> 00:11:39.386]  We got the enemy's M.O.
[00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:41.026]  We got them dead, got their number.
[00:11:45.048 --> 00:11:48.009]  That they were putting troops on death lists to not give them care.
[00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:52.711]  They got plenty of money, they got plenty of services, they want to set the precedent to kill people!
[00:11:53.737 --> 00:11:54.637]  And raise taxes!
[00:11:55.537 --> 00:11:59.918]  All these idiot socialists think, you know, well, we're killing people to save money, we're collect... No, you're not!
[00:12:00.138 --> 00:12:02.019]  You're not even a collectivist honeybee model!
[00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:07.860]  When a bee's lived out its youthfulness, it's programmed to stop eating and just to go die.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.480]  That's not even what's going on here.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.140]  That's bad enough.
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.000]  We're not honeybees.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.601]  We're not collectivist hive insects.
[00:12:19.082 --> 00:12:20.462]  But people don't get upset about that.
[00:12:23.288 --> 00:12:30.811]  Let me tell you, folks ask how I know the things I know, and how so many times I could just call something instantly by just looking at it.
[00:12:32.611 --> 00:12:40.194]  It's because I just know who the players are, I know what their plays are, I know what their operations are, and they don't really change their tricks.
[00:12:40.775 --> 00:12:43.376]  They just do different permutations of the same tricks.
[00:12:43.936 --> 00:12:49.018]  And a lot of globalists are on records saying, why do you do the same operations over and over again?
[00:12:49.058 --> 00:12:49.798]  Because they work.
[00:12:51.459 --> 00:12:52.459]  There's an old saying.
[00:12:55.461 --> 00:12:57.623]  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[00:13:01.385 --> 00:13:06.029]  And we are beating them at many levels in the info war, so they've been changing up and doing some tricks on that front.
[00:13:06.349 --> 00:13:20.840]  There's a lot of new stuff going on, but when it comes to screw jobs, they run a couple dozen different tricks.
[00:13:22.318 --> 00:13:47.129]  And if the public ever learned those tricks, and ever learned the agenda of creating crisis, destabilization, and then the establishment posing as the saviors to gain more power and control, and then to start the next crisis, always consolidating power, always waging war against independence, if people understood that, their power would be greatly diminished and probably broken.
[00:13:50.776 --> 00:13:54.218]  Now, we've got a lot of news coming up and a lot of key intel.
[00:13:54.278 --> 00:13:56.620]  But before I get into any of that, I want to cover our top story.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.884]  And I don't usually do this, but today I'm going to walk you through my thought processes as I saw this story develop.
[00:14:06.066 --> 00:14:09.849]  Davos economist, elite are afraid of Ferguson-style riots.
[00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.071]  Wealth inequity threatens to spur civil unrest.
[00:14:14.612 --> 00:14:17.914]  Now, I saw this story this morning.
[00:14:20.871 --> 00:14:29.830]  And then when I read that it was Robert Johnson at Davos, the official economist of Davos, which is basically Bilderberg Public,
[00:14:31.374 --> 00:14:36.578]  I instantly knew that their answer would be $90 to $100 trillion.
[00:14:36.638 --> 00:14:37.819]  Al Gore says $90 trillion.
[00:14:37.879 --> 00:14:39.280]  The other day it was $100 trillion.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.502]  You can pull those headlines up, going back five years ago.
[00:14:41.742 --> 00:14:43.083]  They just keep saying the same thing every year.
[00:14:43.763 --> 00:14:44.964]  To quote, help the poor.
[00:14:45.084 --> 00:14:46.305]  Oh poor, you're in pain?
[00:14:46.846 --> 00:14:50.048]  Give the IMF and World Bank $90 to $100 trillion.
[00:14:50.308 --> 00:14:54.031]  Give George Soros $5 trillion to fix Ukraine when they spent $5 billion U.S.
[00:14:54.071 --> 00:14:55.312]  taxpayer money to overthrow it.
[00:14:55.852 --> 00:14:57.994]  See, they break it, then they want more money to fix it.
[00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:03.169]  Soros a month ago said give me five billion and we'll have a Marshall Plan.
[00:15:08.712 --> 00:15:09.933]  In fact, pull up the exact number.
[00:15:09.953 --> 00:15:10.973]  I think it was even more than that.
[00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:14.415]  That was just, they spent five billion to overthrow.
[00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:15.616]  The State Department admitted that.
[00:15:16.457 --> 00:15:20.899]  And then he wanted, Soros says give money to fix Ukraine.
[00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:21.620]  Look that up.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.161]  I think it's London Telegraph, BBC.
[00:15:23.621 --> 00:15:31.145]  But what I'm getting at here is, I see that headline and I instantly know what they're going to call for next.
[00:15:32.186 --> 00:15:34.287]  Because it's just, they do the same thing over and over again.
[00:15:34.487 --> 00:15:35.568]  This is not hard to figure out.
[00:15:37.591 --> 00:15:51.500]  Then I come into the studio and we're queuing up the video clip of The Economist and Buckley walks in and says, did you see the article last Friday out of the London Guardian?
[00:15:53.126 --> 00:16:00.087]  Where they're talking about the elite are all running to the hills and buying secret airstrips and command bases in the middle of nowhere around the world.
[00:16:00.127 --> 00:16:01.407]  And I said, yeah, I did see that article.
[00:16:01.427 --> 00:16:03.528]  And he said, yeah, that might tie into this.
[00:16:03.988 --> 00:16:05.148]  And he came and handed me the article.
[00:16:05.188 --> 00:16:08.829]  And lo and behold, it's Robert Johnson, the same economist.
[00:16:08.969 --> 00:16:10.829]  And then I went, where have I heard that name before?
[00:16:12.349 --> 00:16:14.230]  So I started reading the article.
[00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:21.531]  And he is one of George Soros's top people and was the managing director
[00:16:23.183 --> 00:16:24.344]  at the Soros group.
[00:16:24.844 --> 00:16:26.225]  I'm reading from the London Guardian.
[00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:39.393]  So, you've got George Soros that is funding the Ferguson riots on record, funding the Ukraine overthrow, and is on record bragging that he was behind that.
[00:16:39.754 --> 00:16:46.038]  Just type in, Soros brags he was behind Ukraine overthrow, singing in Fareed Zarkaria the whole date.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.903]  Soros admits responsibility for coup and mass murder in Ukraine.
[00:16:50.503 --> 00:16:55.007]  Color Revolution collaboration began soon after endangered fall of Soviet Union.
[00:16:55.768 --> 00:16:56.969]  And guys, I wanted this yesterday.
[00:16:57.009 --> 00:16:57.730]  You may have pulled it up.
[00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:58.411]  It's the U.S.
[00:16:58.471 --> 00:17:01.053]  Ambassador admits that U.S.
[00:17:01.093 --> 00:17:02.875]  funded $5 billion to overthrow Ukraine.
[00:17:02.895 --> 00:17:04.476]  You can pull... I want to play that clip.
[00:17:04.516 --> 00:17:06.118]  It's not enough for me to just say that.
[00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:07.359]  Let's find that clip and play it.
[00:17:07.399 --> 00:17:07.719]  Thank you.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.581]  I don't want to just say it.
[00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:10.942]  We have new listeners.
[00:17:11.002 --> 00:17:11.763]  I want them to hear it.
[00:17:15.083 --> 00:17:16.725]  They're trying to start civil war here.
[00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:17.867]  They're trying to start it over there.
[00:17:19.149 --> 00:17:22.273]  And then Buckley walks in and says, hey, this article ties into it.
[00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:28.062]  And lo and behold, it's the same guy, but acting like jeepers creepers.
[00:17:28.723 --> 00:17:29.724]  We don't like wealth.
[00:17:31.129 --> 00:17:40.251]  Inequity, we want to redistribute, give us 90 to 100 trillion over the next decade in carbon taxes and things, and then who makes the money?
[00:17:40.691 --> 00:17:46.433]  George Soros is in carbon taxes, Al Gore, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers.
[00:17:46.693 --> 00:17:49.073]  The Rothschilds run the biggest exchange in London.
[00:17:49.834 --> 00:17:52.114]  Al Gore has his own called Gore and Blood.
[00:17:53.214 --> 00:17:54.715]  Not Blood and Gore, Gore and Blood.
[00:17:54.755 --> 00:17:55.375]  I'm not joking.
[00:17:55.635 --> 00:17:59.216]  His partner's Lord Blood.
[00:18:00.556 --> 00:18:03.278]  I thought that was Count Dracula, but you can't make up these puns.
[00:18:04.939 --> 00:18:06.940]  So all of this is going on.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.381]  It's just a giant screw job.
[00:18:10.302 --> 00:18:11.403]  And I know you know that.
[00:18:12.463 --> 00:18:16.186]  But here he is, warning everyone.
[00:18:16.506 --> 00:18:19.247]  Oh, the elite are very afraid of Ferguson.
[00:18:19.648 --> 00:18:20.828]  They're running for the hills.
[00:18:20.868 --> 00:18:21.549]  They're hiding.
[00:18:23.376 --> 00:18:37.028]  The truth is, they want to bring in this engineered collapse, buy everything up for pennies on the dollar during the crisis, act like the guys that want to distribute the wealth to fix the problem after the riots, when it'll just be a bigger level of swindling.
[00:18:37.508 --> 00:18:48.037]  I mean, if George Soros helped round up hundreds of Jewish families and rob all their money and brags about it on 60 Minutes and says he's not ashamed of it because, quote, he survived, what do you think he'll do to your family?
[00:18:50.757 --> 00:18:54.458]  Oh, but the average person sees all of the news, the economist.
[00:18:55.158 --> 00:18:58.219]  Oh, so we've got to redistribute wealth right now to the poor people.
[00:18:58.759 --> 00:19:07.021]  But they don't even redistribute it to the poor, because at least they'd spend it on restaurants and cars and, you know, renting things or buying houses.
[00:19:07.541 --> 00:19:12.243]  That would cause inflation and laziness, but it's better than giving it to George Soros and the elite.
[00:19:14.203 --> 00:19:17.224]  So we're going to go to break and come back with this economist
[00:19:18.567 --> 00:19:27.731]  As, I mean this is such a clear example, because I immediately was saying to Buckley, I bet George Soros is involved in this, you know, it's out of Davos.
[00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:42.137]  I'm going to talk about on air how Soros is behind the riots in Ukraine and here, and how now they've got their Davos henchmen out there acting like they're trying to stop it when they're behind it, and it turns out it's the former head of the Soros group saying it.
[00:19:43.899 --> 00:19:45.780]  And people ask, well, how do you just know it's Soros?
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:55.964]  I said months before it was Soros, because I went and looked at the groups that were sponsoring the kill the cop statements and handing out the signs, and it was Soros-backed groups.
[00:19:55.984 --> 00:19:57.545]  And let me tell you what liars they are.
[00:19:57.945 --> 00:20:03.648]  I've had Media Matters, director of media, call me before, wanting to do a, quote, journalist interview about a hit piece.
[00:20:03.928 --> 00:20:05.689]  And I said, you got $3 million from George Soros.
[00:20:05.709 --> 00:20:06.589]  He goes, no, we didn't.
[00:20:06.709 --> 00:20:07.109]  No, we didn't.
[00:20:07.429 --> 00:20:09.470]  And I pulled up the federal filings while I was on the phone with him.
[00:20:09.911 --> 00:20:10.591]  It's just incredible.
[00:20:11.863 --> 00:20:13.924]  What's the best way to keep secret from somebody?
[00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:18.385]  Well, you give them something that they want so bad that they don't care what you're hiding.
[00:20:18.725 --> 00:20:23.667]  The year is 2007 and 20% of the state of California is employed in real estate.
[00:20:23.987 --> 00:20:29.109]  We live in a capitalistic nation of kings and prey upon the greed of the selfish pawns.
[00:20:29.629 --> 00:20:30.909]  Based on a true story.
[00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:35.411]  We created the American dream where everybody could qualify for one of these loans.

[00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:40.105]  Now I've already spent some time getting into the fact that here's George Soros, the spokesman, in the media saying we're gonna have riots, it's horrible, you better give a hundred trillion.
[00:24:40.306 --> 00:24:41.566]  Al Gore only wants 90 trillion.
[00:24:42.627 --> 00:24:45.909]  I'm not joking, Al Gore called this week at Davos for 90
[00:24:47.369 --> 00:24:51.253]  I'll say that again, $90 trillion for global government over the next few years.
[00:24:51.954 --> 00:24:55.478]  Previously it was $100 trillion, and that's what Soros wants.
[00:24:55.498 --> 00:25:00.904]  Or there's going to be riots all over the world, and then who was behind the Arab Spring and bragged about it?
[00:25:01.165 --> 00:25:01.845]  George Soros.
[00:25:02.546 --> 00:25:05.690]  Who was behind global derivatives manipulations driving up food prices?
[00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:06.931]  George Soros!
[00:25:07.412 --> 00:25:12.617]  Who was behind the Ferguson rioting and stirring it up and spending 33 million to get that going?
[00:25:13.198 --> 00:25:18.224]  On record, major investigation by the Washington Times, Soros group admits it, George Soros.
[00:25:18.624 --> 00:25:19.986]  Who was behind overthrowing Ukraine?
[00:25:20.346 --> 00:25:21.768]  In his own words, George Soros!
[00:25:23.953 --> 00:25:25.554]  Who was behind Bill Clinton to a great extent?
[00:25:25.574 --> 00:25:26.214]  George Soros.
[00:25:26.514 --> 00:25:27.935]  Who's behind Barack Obama?
[00:25:27.955 --> 00:25:28.575]  George Soros.
[00:25:29.015 --> 00:25:31.276]  I mean, he's just an active demon in all this.
[00:25:31.356 --> 00:25:32.777]  A top general.
[00:25:33.077 --> 00:25:35.598]  A star player in Satan's army.
[00:25:37.939 --> 00:25:38.960]  A Rothschild agent.
[00:25:41.181 --> 00:25:42.201]  Totally wicked.
[00:25:43.162 --> 00:25:45.043]  And who's one of the top funders to get your guns?
[00:25:45.703 --> 00:25:47.144]  You guessed it, George Soros.
[00:25:48.364 --> 00:25:49.765]  George Soros.
[00:25:52.222 --> 00:26:07.022]  And now his Chief Economist and the former head of the Soros Group, isn't that just special, Robert Johnson, who, quote, heads the Institute of New Economic Thinking and was previously Managing Director at Soros,
[00:26:08.996 --> 00:26:21.725]  Said societies can tolerate income inequity if the income floor is high enough, but with an existing system encouraging chief executives to take decisions solely on profitability, even in the richest countries, inequity is increasing.
[00:26:22.345 --> 00:26:26.828]  Inequity is increasing because they're destroying the middle class under Obama on record.
[00:26:27.188 --> 00:26:32.612]  Here's another headline breaking that down I've got here in my stack that we're going to be going over.
[00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:40.877]  The middle class has gone down the greatest extent since the end of World War II when it began to grow under Obama.
[00:26:41.277 --> 00:26:42.939]  Obama was instrumental in killing it.
[00:26:43.179 --> 00:26:43.700]  And who is he?
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:44.821]  A Soros man.
[00:26:45.883 --> 00:26:51.890]  So here's Robert Johnson warning everyone that the elite are so scared here at Davos of the poor people.
[00:26:53.095 --> 00:26:56.497]  So, give us a hundred trillion, and we'll give it to you.
[00:26:56.837 --> 00:27:01.420]  Kind of like they said five years ago at the Copenhagen World Carbon Tax Summit.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.202]  Oh, we won't let you see the treaty, but it's going to give money to poor people.
[00:27:06.683 --> 00:27:09.104]  The treaty got leaked, and they said, yeah, that's the treaty.
[00:27:09.345 --> 00:27:13.887]  We're going to arrest who leaked it, because you're not supposed to know what we're voting on, because we're so free and open.
[00:27:14.888 --> 00:27:17.910]  And it basically doubled taxes on poor people worldwide.
[00:27:18.632 --> 00:27:19.552]  Through the carbon tax.
[00:27:19.753 --> 00:27:23.635]  I mean, you'll never know why gas and electricity and food so much.
[00:27:25.776 --> 00:27:33.640]  Just like Obamacare only raised seven taxes that you can see on people at the poverty line or below, but a whole bunch of other ones.
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:42.664]  Like Obama's free community college that'll be paid for basically with a bunch of taxes, that'll be passed on to you even though you don't see it on the paycheck.
[00:27:43.925 --> 00:27:45.526]  You don't see a line there saying it.
[00:27:46.086 --> 00:27:47.487]  But it's because they love you.
[00:27:48.658 --> 00:27:50.159]  So let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[00:27:50.299 --> 00:27:57.983]  Here is the Soros minion, his head ringwraith, the Witch King, telling us how much he loves us.
[00:27:58.884 --> 00:28:06.388]  There is an urgency, I believe, because of social instability all over the world rising to address inequality.
[00:28:06.968 --> 00:28:08.329]  This is a powerful group of people.
[00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:09.410]  At some level,
[00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:12.000]  Are they going to recognize it?
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:13.180]  I think the answer is yes.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.462]  A lot of very wealthy and powerful people are quite afraid right now.
[00:28:16.502 --> 00:28:18.383]  They see us on an unstable trajectory.
[00:28:18.863 --> 00:28:24.807]  They don't see our political institutions being what you might call representative, responsive, and pulling things together.
[00:28:25.727 --> 00:28:32.511]  Powerful people can escape the clutches of the government, meaning their company or they themselves don't have to bear the burden.
[00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:34.692]  They don't have to pay more taxes or what have you.
[00:28:35.212 --> 00:28:36.113]  But as the system
[00:28:37.568 --> 00:28:41.009]  It doesn't have proper resources, as it doesn't represent people.
[00:28:41.249 --> 00:28:45.610]  Things are getting more and more dangerous, as the Ferguson, Missouri, brings to bear.
[00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:51.831]  Which you spent $33 million, or your boss did, to destabilize and fan the flames.
[00:28:52.191 --> 00:28:53.892]  As a beta test for the future, for the big one.
[00:28:54.292 --> 00:28:55.932]  I mean, we have you red-handed.
[00:28:57.192 --> 00:29:04.534]  And you're not even trying to create jobs and industry and a stable currency that can create 10-plus percent growth numbers and make us fabulously rich.
[00:29:05.563 --> 00:29:20.989]  You are squatting and perching, and your whole Agenda 21, UN, cloward and pivot strategy is to bankrupt the system, to bring in a total hell, which the elite will then sit offshore and exempt themselves from in the next consolidation phase.
[00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:28.833]  And then after 10 years of consolidation, they'll come back owning everything, with a socially engineered population ready to submit.
[00:29:28.853 --> 00:29:32.254]  Now, you didn't just hear me state their master battle plan today.
[00:29:32.534 --> 00:29:33.895]  You've been hearing it for at least 15 of my 20 years.
[00:29:34.955 --> 00:29:36.796]  I didn't fully understand this the first five years on air.
[00:29:37.816 --> 00:29:50.820]  When we come back, they're now rolling it out in all the big newspapers, from the New York Times, the Financial Times, to the Guardian, because they're getting ready to do a worldwide Arab Spring, but this time a socialist spring, that Al Gore called for two years ago.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:55.001]  We're gonna break down the elite, moving to their bunkers as we speak.
[00:29:55.281 --> 00:29:57.402]  They could be getting ready to detonate nuclear weapons.
[00:30:00.106 --> 00:30:01.027]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.507 --> 00:30:03.128]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.048 --> 00:30:06.850]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.212 --> 00:30:14.214]  Year after year, we watched the threat steadily increase.
[00:30:14.514 --> 00:30:19.857]  And now, this winter has been the worst on record when it comes to our immune systems and health.
[00:30:20.138 --> 00:30:29.203]  For more than two years, InfoWarsLife.com has been watching this crisis intensify, and Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Complex was our answer.

[00:31:14.344 --> 00:31:22.349]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:22.589 --> 00:31:27.613]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:32:25.592 --> 00:32:25.952]  We're good.

[00:32:51.437 --> 00:32:54.219]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.361]  Don't take my word for it.

[00:32:58.642 --> 00:32:59.603]  Discover the secret.

[00:33:30.786 --> 00:33:31.947]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:32.447 --> 00:33:36.890]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:46.797 --> 00:33:48.799]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:48.819 --> 00:33:49.319]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:49.339 --> 00:33:50.180]  Central, we're live.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.142]  Also rebroadcast on stations across the country.
[00:33:55.094 --> 00:33:58.078]  Yes, we cover a lot of epic issues here on the air.
[00:33:58.598 --> 00:34:00.380]  It's because reality is epic.
[00:34:01.161 --> 00:34:02.843]  Reality is over-the-top.
[00:34:03.384 --> 00:34:07.068]  Reality, as it's been said many times, is stranger than fiction.
[00:34:09.751 --> 00:34:14.917]  So, you've got the chief minion of George Soros, Robert Johnson.
[00:34:15.982 --> 00:34:19.644]  Before that name even clicked, I went, well, this is all just Davos propaganda.
[00:34:19.684 --> 00:34:20.685]  They're all in unison.
[00:34:21.125 --> 00:34:23.827]  The CEOs pre-line up their presentations.
[00:34:24.247 --> 00:34:31.191]  It's always, give us hundreds of trillions of dollars, back up our derivatives, thousands of trillions.
[00:34:31.411 --> 00:34:32.011]  I'm not joking.
[00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:33.492]  It's two quadrillion worldwide.
[00:34:33.532 --> 00:34:34.933]  That's two thousand trillion and growing.
[00:34:35.614 --> 00:34:36.914]  Just five years ago, it was 1.6 quadrillion.
[00:34:39.657 --> 00:34:49.425]  And it's the same message, because then that money goes through the UN, through the IMF, through the World Bank, through all these other globalist subsidiaries, and is given in contracts to them.
[00:34:51.547 --> 00:34:53.188]  To develop the countries they want.
[00:34:53.549 --> 00:35:00.234]  And that's why they like to move everything to India, or Mexico, or China, because those are corrupt countries that'll 100% do whatever they say.
[00:35:00.534 --> 00:35:02.576]  And then none of the money gets to the people.
[00:35:04.577 --> 00:35:28.244]  So these are the most cutthroat, nasty, merciless, anti-human, BS artists the world has ever seen, but they sit up there in that nice CEO talk, in an NPR voice, going, oh, the elite are very scared right now of Ferguson and other things, and all over the world there's an inequity as their globalist system takes over.
[00:35:30.643 --> 00:35:35.366]  Warren Buffett, I've got hundreds of billions I control and I'm worth $50 billion.
[00:35:35.906 --> 00:35:44.492]  I gave $50 billion or more over the years to charity and a tax-exempt foundation that runs companies that are exempt and then he gets the money back.
[00:35:45.512 --> 00:35:47.073]  I mean, do you understand that, folks?
[00:35:47.894 --> 00:35:51.056]  He gets up on ABC this week
[00:35:52.133 --> 00:35:57.577]  And, you know, we just need to raise taxes on rich people because I don't hardly pay any.
[00:35:58.037 --> 00:36:01.900]  And then the rich people are $125,000 a year, according to him, and it turns out he's exempt.
[00:36:02.801 --> 00:36:04.682]  And what he wants is the middle class's money.
[00:36:05.102 --> 00:36:08.064]  He was the biggest receiver of the banker bailout.
[00:36:08.725 --> 00:36:12.507]  That's McClatchy Newspaper, not Alex Jones or McClatchy News Service.
[00:36:15.009 --> 00:36:17.351]  Warren Buffett, biggest recipient of bailout.
[00:36:19.076 --> 00:36:23.320]  And of course he's lobbying for higher taxes and going, poor people deserve something free!
[00:36:23.921 --> 00:36:25.862]  Just like they deserve free Obamacare!
[00:36:26.423 --> 00:36:27.784]  And they deserve to be safe!
[00:36:28.285 --> 00:36:31.447]  He gives money to anti-gun groups, but nobody attacks him.
[00:36:31.908 --> 00:36:35.331]  Just like Bill Gates is one of the biggest funders of anti-gun garbage.
[00:36:35.411 --> 00:36:37.793]  It's like, oh well, he's Bill Gates.
[00:36:38.254 --> 00:36:39.435]  He's non-partisan.
[00:36:39.795 --> 00:36:43.699]  He's the most flaming eugenics, hardcore commie you could imagine.
[00:36:43.719 --> 00:36:44.780]  What do you mean he's a billionaire?
[00:36:45.759 --> 00:36:46.540]  One of the richest men in the world.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:52.684]  Well, that's who always funds communism, because they said, offshore, take your money, they're exempt, and you work in a FEMA camp.
[00:36:52.804 --> 00:36:54.565]  I mean, he hadn't figured that out yet?
[00:36:55.026 --> 00:36:59.028]  These are super alpha males that are ready to crush you and your family if they can.
[00:36:59.829 --> 00:37:09.115]  They're working as hard as they can to dumb you down and take your kids away, socially and culturally, and break women off from men, and they're doing a great, devastating job.
[00:37:09.376 --> 00:37:15.020]  And he's working around the clock, both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, to make inoculation the law.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:20.561]  Like it is in India, when those women get those shots, a lot of times they roll out and die.
[00:37:21.221 --> 00:37:26.742]  Other times they just are paralyzed for life, or they have all sorts of horrible neurological disorders.
[00:37:27.242 --> 00:37:29.343]  And boy, that's a hot shot they got for you.
[00:37:29.783 --> 00:37:43.746]  Over here, the soft kill's not quite as noticeable, but they're turning the heat up, studying, seeing if we squirm, seeing how to handle it, getting everybody used to the neurological disorders and cancer off the chart, and people getting their shots and going paralyzed the next day, and just
[00:37:44.406 --> 00:37:47.449]  It's just processing and all, scene of the doctors and nurses notice.
[00:37:47.989 --> 00:37:54.775]  The media doesn't really cover it, so everything's just, just quietly, the ambient temperature is being turned up by these loving people.
[00:37:57.077 --> 00:38:07.326]  Meanwhile, the very same Soros chief, his field marshal, former hedge fund director, Robert Johnson.
[00:38:07.926 --> 00:38:11.509]  That's why they all started getting out of it a few years ago, so they could then criticize it all.
[00:38:12.264 --> 00:38:13.446]  Well, they're not really out of it.
[00:38:13.967 --> 00:38:18.053]  Revealed that worried hedge fund managers were already planning their escapes.
[00:38:18.834 --> 00:38:24.842]  I know hedge fund managers all over the world who are buying airstrips and farms in places like New Zealand because they think they need a getaway.
[00:38:26.044 --> 00:38:27.126]  How many times you heard this from me?
[00:38:28.117 --> 00:38:37.403]  Remember about six years ago, I told you that I ran into a billionaire who's very well known, I'll just leave it at that, and they said, they said, are you ready to be one of the top media people in the world?
[00:38:37.463 --> 00:38:38.443]  And I said, well, why is that?
[00:38:38.463 --> 00:38:42.566]  And they said, because what you're saying is absolutely true.
[00:38:44.807 --> 00:38:46.748]  And it's all going to happen and worse than you know.
[00:38:46.769 --> 00:38:51.271]  And they said in five or six years, the United States as we know it will not exist.
[00:38:51.291 --> 00:38:51.992]  Remember that statement?
[00:38:52.672 --> 00:38:53.853]  Well, we're now five, six years later.
[00:38:56.767 --> 00:39:01.369]  I'm not saying it's all about to happen right now, but this is, this is, but see now they're suddenly announcing it.
[00:39:01.389 --> 00:39:11.974]  It's not Alex Jones telling you he ran into a billionaire in an office complex at a law office a few years ago.
[00:39:13.355 --> 00:39:22.959]  It's in the London Guardian, it's in the Financial Times, it's in the New York Times, it's in the Wall Street Journal, it's in a bunch of other newspapers this week that
[00:39:24.861 --> 00:39:32.303]  The elite are running to the hills, and they're saying, oh, and what's coming is going to be terrible, jeepers creepers, we didn't know it was coming.
[00:39:32.783 --> 00:39:40.086]  You better fund world government with a hundred trillion dollars to redistribute wealth so they can pose as the savior, as the good billionaires.
[00:39:41.006 --> 00:39:45.547]  Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, George Soros, the good demons.
[00:39:48.848 --> 00:39:50.709]  Isn't that just cupcake sweet?
[00:39:52.566 --> 00:39:56.289]  As inequity soars, the nervous super-rich are already planning their escapes.
[00:39:56.349 --> 00:40:01.453]  Hedge fund managers are preparing getaways by buying airstrips and farms.
[00:40:01.593 --> 00:40:11.140]  They're buying islands, building bunkers, hiring permanent mercenaries that live with them, trying to buy off local constabulary.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.724]  Former hedge fund partner tells Davos during session of inequity.
[00:40:16.989 --> 00:40:19.210]  Oh, they're having a whole session on inequity.
[00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:37.717]  They, the ones that engineered it all, the ones that wanted to lift the ladder up so there'd be no free market, the ones that wanted to take the world over, bankrupt it, pose as saviors, and come back in with a worldwide Marshall Plan to fix the global depression, just like George Soros had a Marshall Plan for Greece four years ago.
[00:40:37.857 --> 00:40:40.078]  He's got a Marshall Plan last year and this year.
[00:40:40.338 --> 00:40:43.119]  If they'll just give him billions of dollars, he'll fix
[00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:46.740]  Everything, and he'll bring the money in.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:47.980]  Did you guys ever find that?
[00:40:48.941 --> 00:40:50.721]  George Soros wants Marshall Plan for Ukraine?
[00:40:55.783 --> 00:41:01.485]  So we do have Ambassador... Yeah, you're on air right now, right?
[00:41:01.965 --> 00:41:02.225]  Yes, sir.
[00:41:02.445 --> 00:41:03.105]  Oh, great, great.
[00:41:03.165 --> 00:41:03.766]  Gregory Newland.
[00:41:04.326 --> 00:41:05.926]  Used to, they wouldn't be on air when they were talking to people.
[00:41:05.946 --> 00:41:06.667]  I was talking to myself.
[00:41:06.687 --> 00:41:07.047]  That's good.
[00:41:07.467 --> 00:41:08.447]  Yeah, do we have that clip?
[00:41:08.847 --> 00:41:09.107]  Yes, sir.
[00:41:09.588 --> 00:41:13.049]  Okay, while you're doing that, just search, Soros wants Marshall Plan for Ukraine.
[00:41:13.755 --> 00:41:15.998]  I mean, if we can't find that, I don't know what's going on.
[00:41:16.018 --> 00:41:19.243]  You guys are doing a great job, but I remember that exact headline, so it should be there.
[00:41:19.924 --> 00:41:26.173]  Let's go ahead and play her admitting they got $5 billion to overthrow Ukraine, and then again Soros said the same thing on CNN.
[00:41:26.213 --> 00:41:26.494]  Here it is.
[00:41:27.774 --> 00:41:43.521]  Since Ukraine's independence in 1991, the United States has supported Ukrainians as they build democratic skills and institutions, as they promote civic participation and good governance, all of which are preconditions for Ukraine to achieve its European aspirations.
[00:41:44.042 --> 00:41:52.686]  We've invested over $5 billion to assist Ukraine in these and other goals that will ensure a secure and prosperous and democratic Ukraine.
[00:41:55.387 --> 00:41:56.268]  That's another one.
[00:41:56.308 --> 00:42:00.711]  There's another one where she specifically says in the last four years we've spent five billion.
[00:42:01.211 --> 00:42:02.092]  But there you go.
[00:42:02.912 --> 00:42:07.555]  And again, we can pull up a clip of him on CNN admitting that he was instrumental behind Ukraine.
[00:42:08.636 --> 00:42:22.285]  Starting it, remember the police being firebombed, buildings being burned down, our media saying they're freedom fighters just like the Muslim Brotherhood were freedom fighters, taking over in Egypt and blowing up churches and crucifying Christians and murdering everybody.
[00:42:23.823 --> 00:42:27.166]  And CIA Anderson Cooper says something with a straight face is a great thing?
[00:42:28.607 --> 00:42:35.713]  The reason I get into this for 40-something minutes instead of all the other news, and I'm about to get into that, is that if you understand this, you understand everything.
[00:42:36.333 --> 00:42:44.380]  There is a global destabilization program, and when they destabilize Ireland, or destabilize Greece, or destabilize Ukraine, or destabilize Mexico,
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:50.282]  In fact, they shipped hundreds of thousands of guns in, started a drug war down there.
[00:42:50.342 --> 00:42:59.926]  We told you ten years ago a giant drug war was about to begin in Mexico that was meant to break the country down and being run by the West, that Los Zetas was being trained outside the King Ranch in South Texas.
[00:43:00.987 --> 00:43:05.469]  A DEA agent told us this and was set up and arrested about a month after, Celica Still.
[00:43:05.489 --> 00:43:08.590]  In fact, that was in the news.
[00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:10.451]  Marshall Plan for Mexico.
[00:43:11.211 --> 00:43:13.252]  Ten billion proposed to stabilize.
[00:43:13.452 --> 00:43:14.693]  And then again, that ten billion.
[00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:22.555]  is then pumped through directly to the key players who basically just take the money.
[00:43:22.916 --> 00:43:26.699]  They create the crisis, loot the country, then have a bailout, which they then keep.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.543]  I know I keep just repeating different examples of this.
[00:43:31.284 --> 00:43:31.644]  There it is.
[00:43:31.704 --> 00:43:35.567]  Mexico, a country in crisis, needs a fix the size of the Marshall Plan.
[00:43:35.888 --> 00:43:36.148]  See?
[00:43:36.508 --> 00:43:36.869]  Boom!
[00:43:37.209 --> 00:43:38.070]  What is that, Daily Beast?
[00:43:41.744 --> 00:43:42.044]  Yes, sir.
[00:43:42.625 --> 00:43:45.588]  So it's the same story over and over again.
[00:43:45.668 --> 00:43:46.509]  See, they found that one.
[00:43:46.689 --> 00:43:47.469]  It's always the same.
[00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:49.712]  Marshall Plan, Marshall Plan, Marshall Plan.
[00:43:49.972 --> 00:43:52.594]  That's after they funded Hitler, turned him loose.
[00:43:52.614 --> 00:43:53.595]  He didn't work for the West.
[00:43:53.635 --> 00:43:55.797]  He was put in power by British intelligence and the U.S.
[00:43:55.837 --> 00:43:56.978]  government on record.
[00:43:57.359 --> 00:43:59.121]  Time Magazine, Time of the Year twice.
[00:43:59.541 --> 00:44:01.723]  My grandfather used to hear him on Dallas radio.
[00:44:02.003 --> 00:44:03.184]  They would translate his speeches.
[00:44:04.045 --> 00:44:05.547]  And say what a hero he was.
[00:44:06.027 --> 00:44:08.650]  And then they turned on him once he started invading countries.
[00:44:09.251 --> 00:44:12.094]  He'd made a deal, had a secret treaty that's been declassified.
[00:44:12.114 --> 00:44:17.420]  That's why they kept Albert Speer and others locked up so long to cover it up.
[00:44:17.481 --> 00:44:21.205]  That's why they never let the Deputy Fuhrer, Rudolf Hess, out of the tower.
[00:44:22.346 --> 00:44:24.629]  It was because he parachuted in with the treaty.
[00:44:25.782 --> 00:44:25.962]  I don't
[00:44:43.086 --> 00:44:46.348]  That was Herman Goering, the head of the Luftwaffe, could have taken them all out.
[00:44:46.789 --> 00:44:48.150]  Because they had a deal, folks.
[00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:49.791]  It was all a staged event.
[00:44:50.271 --> 00:44:57.076]  Just like they had a deal with the French for the French military to stand down and then to give the Vichy fascist control, which they did.
[00:44:57.537 --> 00:45:01.079]  The French collaborators just got the car keys to France.
[00:45:01.159 --> 00:45:01.800]  They stood down.
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:03.321]  The Blitzkrieg didn't do anything.
[00:45:03.721 --> 00:45:05.262]  It just rolled over the Maginot Line.
[00:45:05.603 --> 00:45:07.044]  Almost every general stood down.
[00:45:08.865 --> 00:45:09.786]  The French were betrayed.
[00:45:11.664 --> 00:45:14.446]  He'll make these jokes that the French don't fight and can't fight.
[00:45:14.906 --> 00:45:23.193]  The French lost millions of people in World War I. The French were the most war-like country in Europe for hundreds of years, dominating everything.
[00:45:24.273 --> 00:45:25.935]  Napoleon ran around killing millions.
[00:45:26.915 --> 00:45:35.462]  The point is, is they just stood down, just like the Iraqis, not once but twice, because they'd been working for the CIA previously, where allies had been paid off.
[00:45:36.022 --> 00:45:38.004]  In some cases, $50 million.
[00:45:38.444 --> 00:45:40.866]  This has now been declassified as well, per general.
[00:45:41.957 --> 00:45:42.577]  To stand down.
[00:45:46.199 --> 00:45:52.862]  So, then they had a Marshall Plan for private interest with the Bilderberg Group to come in and take over all of Europe.
[00:45:53.618 --> 00:45:54.058]  And they did it.
[00:45:54.579 --> 00:45:56.340]  So that's how you get the infrastructure of a country.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.942]  You trick it into a war, then you have the country lose the war, you take it over.
[00:46:00.582 --> 00:46:10.047]  Or you just infiltrate, cause riots, have a political party you fund to destabilize, bring things down, you then double-cross them, bring in your new party that supposedly is going to fix everything.
[00:46:10.468 --> 00:46:13.409]  This is why we don't just want mindless revolutions in this country.
[00:46:13.689 --> 00:46:17.211]  Because most of the time, they're hijacked or already controlled.
[00:46:17.972 --> 00:46:21.614]  We want a restoration to transparency and a constitutional republic.
[00:46:23.632 --> 00:46:42.936]  But yes, the elites are preparing and digging in for a long global depression, which they will then emerge from as the saviors with a global socialist, communist, carbon tax, redistribution, worldwide Marshall Plan, which Davos is calling for, of wealth redistribution and free health care.
[00:46:43.656 --> 00:46:49.637]  That means you pay more of what you earn into private corporations to run government-controlled health care that gives you death panels.
[00:46:51.932 --> 00:46:54.513]  Oh, you'll get free health care, you just won't get the surgery, ever.
[00:46:57.034 --> 00:47:03.736]  Maybe 1% will get surgeries and they'll be on the news thanking the government for their surgery and saying how great the National Health Service is.
[00:47:04.016 --> 00:47:04.976]  This is a plan.
[00:47:05.296 --> 00:47:06.637]  You want to be slaves, folks?
[00:47:06.917 --> 00:47:07.617]  This is it.
[00:47:08.637 --> 00:47:11.318]  And George Soros was willing at 15, 16, 17 years old
[00:47:15.131 --> 00:47:24.939]  To know how the Jews were hiding, to be able to infiltrate the Jews, to be able to find out where they were at, and to be able to then rob them of their family's wealth.
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:29.523]  He'd promise them safe passage out, he'd set them up, take their money, and laugh at them.
[00:47:29.743 --> 00:47:31.745]  And he's gonna laugh at you and your family.
[00:47:33.226 --> 00:47:34.407]  Because he's liberal.
[00:47:34.748 --> 00:47:36.729]  He loves you and your family.
[00:47:39.992 --> 00:47:42.294]  You know how dangerous it is to get up here and actually attack him?
[00:47:42.414 --> 00:47:42.954]  I don't care.
[00:47:43.786 --> 00:47:45.969]  Just expect them to pull some stuff and I'm ready for it.
[00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:50.173]  Because somebody's got to stand up against these sacks of you-know-what.
[00:47:50.193 --> 00:47:52.556]  And maybe we are done.
[00:47:52.596 --> 00:47:57.041]  Maybe we should be conquered by some 87-year-old bag of pus.
[00:47:57.582 --> 00:47:58.523]  Some pus flap.
[00:47:59.324 --> 00:48:00.585]  Maybe that is who we are.
[00:48:00.605 --> 00:48:02.647]  Maybe that's who we want to be.
[00:48:03.919 --> 00:48:06.962]  Maybe we should just, you know, hey Alex, what's your problem?
[00:48:07.323 --> 00:48:08.984]  Why do you like the cops abusing us?
[00:48:09.325 --> 00:48:10.346]  I'm against the police state.
[00:48:10.406 --> 00:48:11.347]  I fought the police state.
[00:48:11.547 --> 00:48:14.210]  I tried to reform the police before the globalists took them over.
[00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:16.592]  Now they got them ready for civil war.
[00:48:17.353 --> 00:48:21.137]  And the cops are having that moment of thought going, man, this stuff's really happening.
[00:48:21.177 --> 00:48:22.098]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:48:22.699 --> 00:48:23.520]  Other people were right.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.381]  Ron Paul was right.
[00:48:25.868 --> 00:48:28.530]  Do we want to have a civil war just because George Soros says so?
[00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:30.371]  We need to have that debate right now.
[00:48:30.451 --> 00:48:31.893]  We know the enemy program.
[00:48:32.093 --> 00:48:33.874]  We know the entire enemy operation.
[00:48:33.894 --> 00:48:41.660]  Do we just have to sit here and watch them win while they're digging in in Luxembourg and Grand Cayman?
[00:48:42.961 --> 00:48:46.403]  While they're digging in in Monte Carlo?
[00:48:47.624 --> 00:48:51.827]  While they're digging in in most of the elite, as I said,
[00:48:53.479 --> 00:49:04.562]  I got really criticized for this in mainstream media whenever a bunch of big directors, the guy that made Aliens and made the Titanic, what's his name, he made... James Cameron.
[00:49:04.582 --> 00:49:05.622]  James Cameron, thank you.
[00:49:06.602 --> 00:49:08.443]  You know, he ran to New Zealand.
[00:49:09.083 --> 00:49:10.803]  I mean, I know a bunch of Hollywood people.
[00:49:12.104 --> 00:49:14.124]  As everyone knows, whatever reason, a lot of them listen to the show.
[00:49:14.684 --> 00:49:16.184]  Because they're just sick of left-right garbage.
[00:49:16.865 --> 00:49:18.305]  I know people that know James Cameron.
[00:49:18.605 --> 00:49:19.405]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:49:21.506 --> 00:49:22.186]  James Cameron
[00:49:23.547 --> 00:49:25.168]  was given the word to leave the United States.
[00:49:25.228 --> 00:49:28.929]  I said that four years ago, before he left the United States.
[00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:36.153]  And they're mainly going to New Zealand, which is obviously showing the globalists are going to leave that alone.
[00:49:37.693 --> 00:49:44.036]  I tell you, every gut-level, fleshly, worldly, evil instinct I've got is take my family and get to New Zealand.
[00:49:46.717 --> 00:49:48.018]  Take my family and get to New Zealand.
[00:49:48.638 --> 00:49:49.919]  Take my family and get to New Zealand.
[00:49:50.742 --> 00:49:51.242]  But you know what?
[00:49:51.262 --> 00:49:52.723]  I'm going to put my kids on the table.
[00:49:52.763 --> 00:49:56.985]  I'm going to put everything on the roulette wheel.
[00:49:57.005 --> 00:50:04.068]  I'm going to bet everything I got on black to steal something from an excellent movie, The Gambler, a remake with Mark Wahlberg.
[00:50:04.528 --> 00:50:05.408]  And you know what?
[00:50:05.428 --> 00:50:06.709]  I'm not a gambler, but I don't have a choice.
[00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:16.013]  I'm just putting it all on America, just like my ancestors did, coming over in those leaky boats and all the rest of it, just like they did fighting Santa Ana and a bunch of them dying.
[00:50:16.253 --> 00:50:17.773]  I'm putting everything on black.
[00:50:18.274 --> 00:50:18.934]  Boom, baby!
[00:50:19.946 --> 00:50:27.533]  Which means truth and justice and prosperity and freedom, not in the red blood of revolution and world government.
[00:50:27.813 --> 00:50:31.036]  I believe we can beat these people, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:31.676 --> 00:50:34.339]  But I'm putting everything I got against this.
[00:50:34.959 --> 00:50:42.086]  My name, my life, my treasure, my children, my soul, my will, my commitment, everything.
[00:50:43.393 --> 00:50:45.073]  My will, most importantly.
[00:50:45.233 --> 00:50:45.954]  My spirit.
[00:50:45.994 --> 00:50:46.794]  That's what your will is.
[00:50:47.294 --> 00:50:48.074]  My spirit.
[00:50:48.594 --> 00:50:54.496]  I place my spirit, animated by God's light, directly in the way of the enemy.
[00:50:55.176 --> 00:50:56.957]  And if I'm run over, destroyed, that's God's plan.
[00:50:56.977 --> 00:50:57.637]  I don't blame God.
[00:50:57.857 --> 00:50:58.497]  I thank God.
[00:50:59.177 --> 00:51:04.379]  If God just took me and just threw me right up against the New World Order and broke every bone in my body, I thank God.
[00:51:04.619 --> 00:51:05.059]  Forever.
[00:51:05.819 --> 00:51:06.779]  That is a blessing.
[00:51:07.499 --> 00:51:08.200]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:08.640]  Stay with us.
[00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.680]  We've got a lot of news coming up.
[00:51:10.833 --> 00:51:11.734]  This is Sharon Hunt.
[00:51:12.074 --> 00:51:15.476]  Before using Heart and Body Extract, my energy level was very, very low.
[00:51:15.937 --> 00:51:18.818]  I could only walk a few feet and then would have to sit down.
[00:51:19.179 --> 00:51:20.499]  I was tired and lethargic.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:28.004]  But after taking Heart and Body Extract, my energy level has improved greatly and I can now walk longer distances without getting tired so fast.
[00:51:28.404 --> 00:51:29.805]  Thank you, Heart and Body Extract.

[00:51:40.589 --> 00:51:41.410]  This is an alert.
[00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:45.632]  If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.

[00:52:59.464 --> 00:53:00.005]  Don't wait.
[00:53:00.405 --> 00:53:01.066]  Just call 1-800-852-1820.

[00:54:07.093 --> 00:54:08.593]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[00:54:33.106 --> 00:54:35.067]  People ask why I get so excited sometimes.
[00:54:35.327 --> 00:54:36.387]  Alex Jones here back live.
[00:54:36.407 --> 00:54:51.871]  How could you not get excited with a bunch of crooks setting up world government that make their money out of getting government contracts and banker bailouts and have created 2,000 plus trillion of garbage, derivatives, counterfeit, and have signed us onto it.
[00:54:52.231 --> 00:54:58.633]  And the former head of the Federal Reserve goes on Laird News Hour and says we're above the law, Congress cannot affect us, and we run America.
[00:54:58.653 --> 00:55:00.193]  I mean, I can play that clip.
[00:55:00.573 --> 00:55:02.214]  By the way, they found the CNN headline.
[00:55:02.834 --> 00:55:07.017]  Where George Soros says we need a Marshall Plan.
[00:55:07.878 --> 00:55:10.019]  There it is, Soros, Ukraine needs U.S.
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:11.660]  Marshall Plan.
[00:55:14.522 --> 00:55:16.964]  Or Soros, Ukraine needs E.U.
[00:55:17.344 --> 00:55:18.125]  Marshall Plan.
[00:55:18.525 --> 00:55:19.445]  Thank you, I was going from memory.
[00:55:19.486 --> 00:55:20.266]  There it is on screen.
[00:55:20.906 --> 00:55:25.590]  So my point is, they wreck it, then they bring in their takeover plan as a solution.
[00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:31.594]  And can George Soros start a civil war in America?
[00:55:32.742 --> 00:55:38.485]  They threw everything they could, the Democrats and MSNBC, behind stirring up race riots in this country.
[00:55:38.525 --> 00:55:45.388]  They effectively got misguided, mindless, hateful criminals to target white people.
[00:55:46.129 --> 00:55:51.271]  Just like if you hyped up, you know, kill black people, you might get some horrible misguided white people to go out and do it.
[00:55:52.252 --> 00:55:54.333]  And it's still going on, but they didn't get
[00:55:55.498 --> 00:55:57.139]  The mass resistance they wanted.
[00:55:57.299 --> 00:56:08.524]  Only, you know, cops are getting shot at everywhere and a few have been killed here and there, but it hasn't started the big civil war like they got in Egypt, or like they got in Ukraine, or like they got in other areas.
[00:56:09.585 --> 00:56:11.646]  And it's because we still have a lot of wealth in this country.
[00:56:12.126 --> 00:56:23.832]  They're trying to suck it all out as fast as they can, a la Cloward and Piven, which is one of their admitted plans to bankrupt the society so there's riots nationwide, so they have a pretext to take over.
[00:56:24.656 --> 00:56:30.440]  And by the way, I don't just know this historically watching the Hegelian Dialectic of Problem-Reaction-Solution.
[00:56:31.901 --> 00:56:41.387]  In the 111-point plan leaked when the Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiklitz quit the World Bank as their chief economist.
[00:56:42.208 --> 00:56:43.849]  Not saying he leaked it, he's been on the show.
[00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:46.150]  It came out right when he left.
[00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:47.611]  It was given to Greg Palast.
[00:56:48.412 --> 00:56:50.233]  We're going to get Greg Palast on about this soon.
[00:56:51.294 --> 00:56:54.076]  And Greg Palast came on and released the documents.
[00:56:55.089 --> 00:57:06.477]  And in the plan was how to create social unrest, to cause riots, a war with the police, that will further devalue the currency and the country, so the globalists can come in with a Marshall Plan to take over.
[00:57:07.477 --> 00:57:20.126]  Same deal, that's what they're trying to get ready, while they build their armored redoubts, to have a global depression, they weather, and then at the other end of, a merge with a planetary government as the answer to counter all of it.
[00:57:20.868 --> 00:57:28.589]  Now, we're not funded like George Soros with your taxpayer money they swindle, or MSNBC that gets taxpayer money through stimulus funds.

[00:59:00.799 --> 00:59:04.300]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:08.421]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:59:08.721 --> 00:59:10.181]  Can you put two and two together?

[01:00:16.721 --> 01:00:17.362]  Big Brother.
[01:00:18.023 --> 01:00:19.044]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:19.805 --> 01:00:20.906]  Government cover-ups.

[01:00:23.149 --> 01:00:24.071]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:24.691 --> 01:00:28.316]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.897 --> 01:00:32.942]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:37.005]  Stories up on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:37.085 --> 01:00:40.265]  We'll bring it up with the first and top hacker.
[01:00:40.805 --> 01:00:42.706]  Captain Crunch is joining us from Thailand.
[01:00:43.626 --> 01:00:48.807]  The Real Life Matrix, MIT researchers revealed interface that can allow the computer to plug into the brain.
[01:00:49.307 --> 01:00:53.428]  They've actually had this for a long time, but they're now rolling it all out to the slaves.
[01:00:54.268 --> 01:00:58.268]  That is coming up, ladies and gentlemen, in the next segment.
[01:00:58.849 --> 01:01:00.769]  I kind of went into an hour-long rant.
[01:01:02.315 --> 01:01:14.600]  But I don't apologize for it because the master plan is a global destabilization program and global civil war where the police and the citizens and the military all kill each other and society breaks down.
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:23.063]  The globalists want a new dark age where they have high-tech enclaves and reservations but we live in just a third world hell squatter.
[01:01:23.083 --> 01:01:25.664]  And that's exactly what Davos has been saying.
[01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:30.906]  It's good for the earth for you to be poor and to pay more of your tax money for wealth redistribution to the elite.
[01:01:32.293 --> 01:01:33.513]  Because that's what helps the poor people.
[01:01:34.133 --> 01:01:47.356]  And unfortunately, the average poor person never was taught how the world really works, and so they have no idea what is actually unfolding, and it is extremely sad to say the least, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:48.056 --> 01:01:53.937]  So that's some of the basics that we're going to be breaking down on that front today.
[01:01:55.977 --> 01:02:00.398]  Continuing with this other news that we're going to be getting to,
[01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:06.568]  Venezuela vice president is head of drug cartel, claims deputy security chief.
[01:02:07.128 --> 01:02:11.131]  Well, I mean, in what Latin American country is the government head not the head of the cartel?
[01:02:11.831 --> 01:02:16.175]  I mean, in the United States, the CIA is the head of all major narcotics trafficking operations.
[01:02:16.235 --> 01:02:21.479]  I mean, that came out in Congress back in 1998 with a solicitor inspector general.
[01:02:22.159 --> 01:02:23.259]  I was about to say Solicitor General.
[01:02:23.279 --> 01:02:25.080]  I was Inspector General of the CIA.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.361]  Obama to seek more funds for antibiotic-resistant bacteria fight.
[01:02:30.142 --> 01:02:30.522]  Poll.
[01:02:30.602 --> 01:02:34.323]  Large majority of Americans oppose Obama's immigration actions.
[01:02:35.204 --> 01:02:37.324]  Chicago confirms first case of measles.
[01:02:37.384 --> 01:02:38.105]  Oh, I'm so scared.
[01:02:38.685 --> 01:02:40.825]  We've done some special reports, pretty much proving.
[01:02:41.446 --> 01:02:44.987]  There's a lot of corollary evidence that, well, they admit the news.
[01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:47.568]  Why are vaccinated people getting the measles?
[01:02:48.268 --> 01:02:50.749]  Seems like they get vaccinated and they get the measles.
[01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:53.469]  The articles in mainstream news don't say that it did that.
[01:02:53.489 --> 01:03:02.251]  It just says, yeah, it's strange there's a measles outbreak because everybody who has the measles recently was vaccinated.
[01:03:03.371 --> 01:03:06.692]  I don't know what's going on there.
[01:03:08.392 --> 01:03:10.473]  I got the shingle shot.
[01:03:11.373 --> 01:03:17.194]  My dad, before he retired out of oral surgery and dentistry last year, he still does some consulting.
[01:03:18.373 --> 01:03:19.954]  Just said old person after old person.
[01:03:19.994 --> 01:03:28.338]  They're the ones that trust the system the most, I guess, would come in and go, ah, yeah, they may have to cut my leg off, David, Dr. Jones.
[01:03:28.358 --> 01:03:34.061]  I got shingleses, but it's not like shingles I ever had in my life.
[01:03:34.121 --> 01:03:37.343]  It's eaten down to the bone.
[01:03:39.244 --> 01:03:45.167]  They'd always say, I don't know why I got a shingles vaccination two weeks ago, and then I got the shingles.
[01:03:48.595 --> 01:03:53.018]  And he just sits there with his mouth hanging open, and he just said he saw scores of people the last few years.
[01:03:54.079 --> 01:03:55.981]  You take the shingles shot, you get the shingles.
[01:03:56.021 --> 01:03:59.523]  You take the measles, mumps, rubella, you get the measles, the mumps, or rubella.
[01:04:00.384 --> 01:04:02.245]  You take the whooping cough vaccine, you get it.
[01:04:02.646 --> 01:04:06.809]  It's even come out in the news that it's been connected to the inoculations.
[01:04:09.491 --> 01:04:14.615]  Simply mind-boggling that all of this is going on.
[01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:19.258]  I've got all this other news.
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.750]  I mean, how do I even cover all this?
[01:04:23.373 --> 01:04:29.398]  The TSA is now going to check all your web profiles and see what you basically politically are saying and up to before you fly.
[01:04:29.758 --> 01:04:35.863]  I told you they'd roll out as the new National Stasi Domestic Spy Police Force because 14 years ago they were being founded.
[01:04:36.344 --> 01:04:38.225]  Watch the C-SPAN program where they admitted all this.
[01:04:38.245 --> 01:04:40.407]  They said to have a job anywhere you'll have to go to the TSA.
[01:04:40.427 --> 01:04:46.912]  That's now gone from government jobs to high security jobs to infrastructure protection jobs to general jobs.
[01:04:46.932 --> 01:04:48.694]  And they're now fanning out the streets of America.
[01:04:48.714 --> 01:04:51.916]  And they're set to double the size of in the next few years.
[01:04:53.567 --> 01:04:54.368]  Just get ready.
[01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:58.092]  But the border will be wide open.
[01:04:59.454 --> 01:05:04.800]  And there's also another report, air passengers, bank details to be handed over every time you fly.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.861]  So there you go.
[01:05:06.662 --> 01:05:07.563]  Talk about tyranny.
[01:05:07.763 --> 01:05:08.284]  You got it.
[01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:09.265]  Who funded ISIS?
[01:05:09.325 --> 01:05:09.786]  You guessed it.
[01:05:10.711 --> 01:05:14.574]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[01:05:15.314 --> 01:05:21.579]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.

[01:08:13.186 --> 01:08:15.288]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:15.888 --> 01:08:18.670]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:42.369 --> 01:08:45.730]  Well, it's in the Daily Mail today, the Real Life Matrix.
[01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:51.492]  MIT researchers reveal interface that can allow a computer to plug directly into the brain.
[01:08:52.192 --> 01:08:58.915]  Well, my uncle, who has epilepsy from a motorcycle accident, has a wire and chip up in his brain.
[01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:03.116]  So, again, a lot of this is just the media announcing something that's already there.
[01:09:03.176 --> 01:09:08.058]  But they had robo-rats, robo-roaches 25 years ago that they could remote control.
[01:09:08.738 --> 01:09:09.938]  Biological androids.
[01:09:10.318 --> 01:09:11.599]  A rat turned into a cyborg.
[01:09:12.518 --> 01:09:18.550]  System could deliver optical signals and drugs directly into the brain.
[01:09:18.971 --> 01:09:22.237]  Could lead to devices for treatment of conditions such as Parkinson's.
[01:09:22.277 --> 01:09:23.901]  Yes, it has a lot of great
[01:09:25.131 --> 01:09:26.252]  Great applications.
[01:09:26.292 --> 01:09:31.375]  The problem is Trojan horse systems are being built into everything.
[01:09:31.856 --> 01:09:35.638]  We'll get into that and more coming up with Captain Crunch.
[01:09:35.758 --> 01:09:37.599]  And we're going to open the phones up for Captain Crunch.
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:42.663]  John Draper, the first hacker, the most famous hacker undoubtedly.
[01:09:43.503 --> 01:09:44.904]  He is a listener of the broadcast.
[01:09:45.225 --> 01:09:49.608]  Last time he was on the show, the first time, it was a news making interview.
[01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:58.853]  He had been in the hospital, his back in horrible shape, surgeries, you name it, basically on the edge of...
[01:10:00.815 --> 01:10:02.396]  You know, financially not doing too well.
[01:10:02.977 --> 01:10:04.999]  And you, the listeners, came to his aid and helped him.
[01:10:05.459 --> 01:10:07.921]  PayPal, predictably, froze the account.
[01:10:08.322 --> 01:10:10.704]  They've done that to us before when some money comes in.
[01:10:11.445 --> 01:10:13.647]  You have to reach out to the PayPal account.
[01:10:13.927 --> 01:10:15.208]  He wanted to tell folks, thank you.
[01:10:15.228 --> 01:10:15.989]  He's going to say that now.
[01:10:16.429 --> 01:10:19.993]  But reconfirm with them that it's not fraud to get the money.
[01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:21.874]  Again, another one of these Bilderberg billionaires.
[01:10:22.655 --> 01:10:23.856]  Uh, that thinks he's gonna live forever.
[01:10:23.876 --> 01:10:26.177]  Uh, but I wish he would just get people their money.
[01:10:26.217 --> 01:10:27.218]  That would actually be nice.
[01:10:27.718 --> 01:10:29.559]  Especially a public figure like John Draper.
[01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:33.281]  But thank you for helping get Captain Crunch back on his feet, literally.
[01:10:34.021 --> 01:10:35.402]  And he's gonna tell you all about that.
[01:10:35.422 --> 01:10:36.663]  But then we're gonna get into the NSA.
[01:10:36.803 --> 01:10:39.945]  We're gonna get into the Sony hack, which of course was an inside job.
[01:10:40.245 --> 01:10:40.925]  A PR stunt.
[01:10:41.325 --> 01:10:43.126]  Cyber security, SOPA, CISPA.
[01:10:43.667 --> 01:10:47.249]  Why, on the heels of Charlie Hebdo, let's defend free speech!
[01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:51.272]  Let's arrest people that criticize homosexuals in France.
[01:10:51.812 --> 01:10:57.057]  Let's ban protesting the Islamification in Germany because we got free speech.
[01:10:57.677 --> 01:11:01.901]  And let's get rid of internet freedom here in America with SOPA and CISPA.
[01:11:02.681 --> 01:11:04.883]  Webcrunchers.com is his website.
[01:11:05.364 --> 01:11:08.586]  And then in the third hour, I'm going to get into all the news I haven't mentioned.
[01:11:08.686 --> 01:11:09.067]  Obama.
[01:11:09.427 --> 01:11:13.150]  Large majority of Americans opposed to Obama's immigration actions.
[01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:15.892]  He doesn't care what polls or the Constitution say.
[01:11:16.833 --> 01:11:27.978]  We're going to get into more on what's happening at Davos, more on what's happening in Ukraine, the 19 ingredients in McDonald's fries, including silicone, silly putty ingredient.
[01:11:28.739 --> 01:11:31.020]  So that's all coming up as well.
[01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:31.820]  U.S.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.642]  watchdog urges safeguards for Internet of Things.
[01:11:35.122 --> 01:11:38.703]  That's the smart meters, the smart dust, the tracking grid.
[01:11:39.164 --> 01:11:41.985]  Oh, just like Davos' warning of wealth inequity.
[01:11:42.045 --> 01:11:44.746]  Well, they're the very robber barons that engineered this on record.
[01:11:45.186 --> 01:12:00.531]  Oh, the Feds are worried that your toaster could get hacked or your TV could be watching you, even though they had the international meetings years ago to have this all added ubiquitously in an integrated, standardized system worldwide.
[01:12:00.951 --> 01:12:08.334]  Now they're going to warn us about it and charge you with felonies if you hack into your neighbor's camera.
[01:12:09.045 --> 01:12:11.587]  But the Feds, they're not hacked in.
[01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:11.847]  Why?
[01:12:12.207 --> 01:12:13.428]  They're just jacked in.
[01:12:14.408 --> 01:12:25.576]  Think about how incredible that is, and that Samsung two months ago came out and said, yeah, your camera and your microphone on all our new TVs, third parties record it, we sell the data, and they even said, so watch what you say.
[01:12:25.616 --> 01:12:27.317]  They said, so watch what you say.
[01:12:27.337 --> 01:12:28.438]  Hear that?
[01:12:29.018 --> 01:12:29.939]  You buy our $3,000 TV?
[01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:35.782]  Buddy, you watch what you say, because we're such a free society.
[01:12:37.492 --> 01:12:43.518]  See, they're going so over the top, they just think you'll go into a learned helplessness catatonic state.
[01:12:43.619 --> 01:12:51.367]  Now, John Draper hacked into the CIA phones, called up Richard Nixon famously, was put in prison for it.
[01:12:52.898 --> 01:12:56.959]  He's helped an enormous list of individuals, mostly in tech and hacking world.
[01:12:57.019 --> 01:12:58.719]  He invented a lot of the stuff that Apple uses.
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:00.300]  Got no money for it.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.400]  Contributing to the foundation of many gadgets.
[01:13:02.841 --> 01:13:08.242]  We have today, also called President Nixon to tell him Los Angeles is running out of bullet papers, so he has such a humor.
[01:13:09.342 --> 01:13:11.063]  You gotta have that or you'll go crazy.
[01:13:11.343 --> 01:13:15.284]  You gotta be crazy or you'll go nuts, as all of us who are crazy know.
[01:13:15.824 --> 01:13:19.985]  Known as Captain Crunch for his legendary phone freaking, Draper has
[01:13:20.505 --> 01:13:23.109]  Always been driven by passion and not money.
[01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:29.898]  The point was not just to make free calls, but to explore and learn from the phone company's rich and sophisticated system.
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:31.421]  Complicated system.
[01:13:31.441 --> 01:13:35.807]  Despite his many contributions to companies such as Apple, where he wrote the first word processor,
[01:13:36.127 --> 01:13:39.428]  called Easy Rider for Apple II, Crunch is not a wealthy man.
[01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:46.410]  And you know, you the listeners helped get him from collapse level and medical level, could have even died, to now being back on his feet quite literally.
[01:13:46.710 --> 01:13:49.751]  So Captain Crunch, I don't want to spend the whole interview thanking folks, we want to thank you.
[01:13:50.091 --> 01:13:57.513]  But give folks an update on where you are, you look a lot better, look a lot healthier, and then let's get into what's happening around the world with the first hacker.
[01:13:57.813 --> 01:13:58.133]  Go ahead.
[01:13:59.697 --> 01:14:00.718]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:14:01.518 --> 01:14:21.211]  First off, I want to thank you for having me on last October, because it turns out that one of your viewers, Dr. D, heard my interview on your last show and is now offering me free stem cell treatments here in Bangkok, Thailand, which is where I'm at now.
[01:14:21.811 --> 01:14:23.653]  It's like 1.14 a.m.
[01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:24.473]  in the morning here.
[01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:28.656]  Well, thank you for coming on, and of course you also wanted to thank the listeners.
[01:14:29.693 --> 01:14:35.576]  Yeah, and I also want to thank all of those people who contributed to my healing fund.
[01:14:36.436 --> 01:14:50.283]  Unfortunately, PayPal has basically withheld more than half of the money owed to me because a lot of my donors have not yet confirmed their pledge to my fund.
[01:14:50.883 --> 01:14:54.065]  So if you've made a pledge to my fund and have
[01:14:54.665 --> 01:14:59.570]  If you have not received an email message, more than likely you will have received it by now.
[01:14:59.690 --> 01:15:03.434]  Please respond to that email message by clicking on a link.
[01:15:03.514 --> 01:15:06.757]  I think it's going to have an embedded link in there that will take you to your PayPal.
[01:15:07.278 --> 01:15:09.380]  And all you have to do is just confirm everything.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.742]  And that's all you really have to do.
[01:15:10.762 --> 01:15:15.747]  And PayPal would release some of that money to me, which would be greatly appreciated right now.
[01:15:16.274 --> 01:15:16.634]  You bet.
[01:15:16.654 --> 01:15:20.999]  I know you're famous for never asking for anything and then you ended up basically with nothing in the end.
[01:15:21.039 --> 01:15:32.650]  You need to write a tell-all book and get it published or be part of a documentary and hopefully the documentary filmmakers would cut you on the profits because there's so many iconic famous people who end up penniless.
[01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:34.432]  I mean you could use Van Gogh as an example.
[01:15:35.113 --> 01:15:35.854]  He never had anything.
[01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:39.473]  That's exactly what I'm working on right here in Thailand.
[01:15:40.174 --> 01:15:44.139]  I'm working with my friend Aaron Getting, who is a longtime friend of mine.
[01:15:44.159 --> 01:15:50.906]  He's been around for many, many years, and he probably knows me more than any of my other friends.
[01:15:51.407 --> 01:15:54.831]  He lives here in Bangkok, and I have an opportunity to work with him while I'm here.
[01:15:55.842 --> 01:15:57.103]  Very exciting.
[01:15:57.724 --> 01:16:02.629]  Maybe we can get you out on the street someday to do a Skype interview from a busy pedestrian area.
[01:16:02.669 --> 01:16:03.730]  That'd be a powerful image.
[01:16:04.571 --> 01:16:07.854]  Shifting gears... Well, I've got to remember though, Alex, it's one in the morning here.
[01:16:08.735 --> 01:16:09.135]  Oh, I know.
[01:16:09.175 --> 01:16:13.299]  I'm saying sometime we ought to actually get you out on the street with a live Skype feed.
[01:16:13.319 --> 01:16:16.943]  We've already got some photos of you in Thailand that we're showing viewers right now.
[01:16:17.263 --> 01:16:19.025]  Looks like a very, very rich culture.
[01:16:20.049 --> 01:16:20.849]  It is indeed.
[01:16:21.289 --> 01:16:23.670]  There are street fairs right near where I live.
[01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:37.213]  I'm actually in the Siloam district and I have a flat here and I just have to walk a short distance down an alleyway and I get all these little street vendors and the food is insanely inexpensive here.
[01:16:37.313 --> 01:16:38.053]  It's amazing.
[01:16:38.233 --> 01:16:38.954]  How's your back doing?
[01:16:38.974 --> 01:16:48.656]  The weather is really nice too because it hasn't rained at all and being in the tropics you could expect a lot of rain but every day has been clear and sunny and warm and tropical.
[01:16:49.156 --> 01:16:51.177]  How's your back doing?
[01:16:51.718 --> 01:16:56.061]  It's a little painful at times, but the stem cells are working.
[01:16:56.541 --> 01:16:57.862]  I have to give it some time.
[01:16:57.882 --> 01:16:59.603]  I feel kind of up and down.
[01:16:59.683 --> 01:17:04.246]  It depends on, you know, how I feel and what my stress level is.
[01:17:04.326 --> 01:17:07.168]  I'm doing my best to try to keep things under control.
[01:17:08.092 --> 01:17:09.633]  Alright, I've got a bunch of news.
[01:17:09.854 --> 01:17:14.618]  I want to go over NSA, brain chips, I want to break it all down with you today.
[01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:25.186]  But first off, looking at the panopticonic system, the premeditated rollout of these big corporations and government, they announced in England yesterday, and we'll put that article
[01:17:26.167 --> 01:17:36.209]  Up on screen for viewers that they're going to use the new boxes in the cars to tax folks by the mile and to take control of their engines to quote, you know, cut back on greenhouse gas.
[01:17:36.529 --> 01:17:37.249]  How nice of them!
[01:17:37.269 --> 01:17:39.670]  See, they're going to surveil us to save the earth.
[01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:43.250]  The head of the CIA said your washing machine is watching you.
[01:17:43.651 --> 01:17:44.371]  Now, U.S.
[01:17:44.451 --> 01:17:47.071]  watchdog urges safeguards for Internet of Things.
[01:17:47.571 --> 01:17:48.812]  French news agency, a U.S.
[01:17:48.852 --> 01:17:50.732]  government consumer watchdog agency called
[01:17:51.372 --> 01:17:52.673]  I mean, it's totally insane.
[01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:53.434]  I can't believe it.
[01:17:53.494 --> 01:17:55.856]  You know, next thing you know, you're not watching your TV.
[01:17:55.976 --> 01:17:57.457]  Your TV's watching you!
[01:18:11.107 --> 01:18:12.487]  Well, that's now happening.
[01:18:12.547 --> 01:18:19.749]  Did you see where Samsung told people in the purchase ticket, they had a contract, people read it and it said, we are going to be watching and listening to you?
[01:18:20.650 --> 01:18:23.130]  Yeah, I haven't actually seen this specific thing.
[01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:39.295]  You know, just like this new NSA revelation came out, this QWERTY, this QWERTY, what was it, the Trojan, it smells and it looks just like the Trojan that the hackers released earlier.
[01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:44.301]  And it's amazing, and I wonder where they got that Trojan from.
[01:18:45.182 --> 01:18:45.623]  Hmm.
[01:18:46.224 --> 01:18:46.604]  Sure.
[01:18:47.365 --> 01:18:47.586]  Sure.
[01:18:47.626 --> 01:18:55.918]  So most of the time, a lot of the nasty black hat worms and Trojans out there, it's come out, come from our loving friends at the NSA or FBI.
[01:18:56.994 --> 01:19:00.616]  Well, yeah, I'm talking about the Regent Trojan.
[01:19:01.337 --> 01:19:08.701]  The Regent Trojan smells just like the Qwerty Trojan, and the Qwerty Trojan was one of the Trojans that was released in one of the Snowden documents.
[01:19:08.861 --> 01:19:09.521]  Sure, exactly.
[01:19:09.561 --> 01:19:10.362]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:19:10.442 --> 01:19:17.166]  I mean, I read the news every day, and it actually comes out that most of the really nasty Trojans and things are produced by our loving government.
[01:19:18.243 --> 01:19:27.448]  Yeah, and of course the hackers have been contributing and doing most of the heavy lifting by writing the Trojans themselves, and the NSA just repurposes them for their own use.
[01:19:28.529 --> 01:19:29.430]  Isn't that loving?
[01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:31.731]  We're about to go to break, Captain Crunch.
[01:19:31.751 --> 01:19:34.232]  Tell us what you want to cover first when we come back.
[01:19:35.513 --> 01:19:35.873]  Okay.
[01:19:36.634 --> 01:19:38.195]  What are some of the things that are on your mind right now?
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:47.154]  Uh, I do want to talk a little bit about Sony hack, of course, and, uh, I also want to talk about pretty much anything you want to ask me.
[01:19:47.314 --> 01:19:49.238]  You know, my listeners want to ask me stuff.
[01:19:49.298 --> 01:19:50.139]  I got a bunch of stuff.
[01:19:51.744 --> 01:19:57.688]  I spend a lot of time reading Reddit, and I've been spending a lot of time reading all the internet news, you know?
[01:19:58.028 --> 01:20:01.331]  Some of my favorite TV broadcasters are RT.com.
[01:20:02.312 --> 01:20:03.913]  People may think, well, it's Russia.
[01:20:04.173 --> 01:20:04.713]  Who cares?
[01:20:04.913 --> 01:20:07.555]  Hey, they got the best, uh, they got the least- Sure.
[01:20:07.615 --> 01:20:08.596]  Captain Crunch, stay there.
[01:20:08.616 --> 01:20:09.577]  We're gonna come right back to you.
[01:20:10.416 --> 01:20:12.997]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:20:13.257 --> 01:20:18.119]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:20:18.379 --> 01:20:26.242]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:20:26.503 --> 01:20:30.804]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:20:31.024 --> 01:20:34.826]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:20:34.986 --> 01:20:40.690]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:20:40.930 --> 01:20:43.712]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:20:44.092 --> 01:20:49.316]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:21:09.983 --> 01:21:12.265]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?

[01:21:16.407 --> 01:21:18.209]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:21:18.569 --> 01:21:27.575]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.

[01:22:10.083 --> 01:22:14.426]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[01:22:14.546 --> 01:22:19.288]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[01:22:19.408 --> 01:22:23.271]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease.
[01:22:23.451 --> 01:22:26.873]  And a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[01:22:27.113 --> 01:22:29.654]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[01:22:29.774 --> 01:22:34.155]  I've taken away protein products for years and I've never noticed results I have with your product.
[01:22:34.235 --> 01:22:37.195]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life.
[01:22:37.435 --> 01:22:41.316]  Within a few days of taking One World Away, I noticed a dramatic change.
[01:22:41.736 --> 01:22:45.437]  Also in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[01:22:45.657 --> 01:22:49.098]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[01:22:49.718 --> 01:22:53.201]  For the past week or so, I'm not feeling bad anymore, and the foot pain is gone.
[01:22:53.221 --> 01:22:57.584]  I'm just finishing up the five-pound tub I ordered and just got off the phone ordering more.
[01:22:57.724 --> 01:22:58.625]  I love your product.
[01:22:58.725 --> 01:22:59.085]  Thank you.

[01:23:14.517 --> 01:23:15.958]  Make sure you're not one of them.

[01:24:20.643 --> 01:24:23.731]  You know, they call the Daily Mail a tabloid.
[01:24:23.791 --> 01:24:25.776]  I think it's one of the best newspapers in the world.
[01:24:25.796 --> 01:24:29.525]  I mean, I know what real news is, and what's in here is usually...
[01:24:30.934 --> 01:24:38.419]  In there a month, two months, a year before it's in the Financial Times of London, or the Wall Street Journal, or the New York Times.
[01:24:38.939 --> 01:24:42.942]  Malicious RAIN malware created by NSA, researchers believe.
[01:24:43.402 --> 01:24:45.804]  And then you look at the science, they've got all the data in here.
[01:24:46.384 --> 01:24:49.526]  It's extremely clear that that's exactly what's going on.
[01:24:49.546 --> 01:24:53.249]  And that's what Captain Crunch, the first and top hacker,
[01:24:55.134 --> 01:25:02.298]  Computer hacking, whistling into telephones, inventing the science of taking them over by basically voice command.
[01:25:02.318 --> 01:25:08.342]  I mean, just truly a savant at every level when it came to that.
[01:25:08.642 --> 01:25:10.924]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:25:11.204 --> 01:25:15.446]  He'd love to hear from you and take your calls, questions or comments for Captain Crunch.
[01:25:15.766 --> 01:25:21.350]  You can also tweet them at us at RealAlexJones, just send your tweets over there, they'll bring some of those.
[01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:22.852]  Into me as well.
[01:25:22.872 --> 01:25:26.777]  800-259-9231 800-259-9231 Your chance to talk to the first and undisputed greatest hacker in history.
[01:25:37.776 --> 01:25:46.605]  They could argue that some of the other people are notorious as well, but certainly not as notorious as Captain Crunch.
[01:25:47.326 --> 01:25:50.049]  And nothing he did was nefarious as well.
[01:25:50.789 --> 01:25:54.113]  But going back to Captain Crunch, your take on the Sony hack.
[01:25:54.513 --> 01:25:55.795]  Let's spend some time on that.
[01:25:57.168 --> 01:25:58.029]  Well, yeah.
[01:25:58.309 --> 01:26:08.855]  According to reports I've been getting, there's a really good article in Deadline.com, which has a very good timeline for the Sony hack.
[01:26:09.195 --> 01:26:17.220]  And according to this timeline, Sony's computers were pretty much capped out for seven days and even longer.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.763]  And this allegation that North Korea had something to do with it,
[01:26:23.203 --> 01:26:31.850]  Well, I kind of suspected that that might be the case, but I wouldn't say it was directly hacked from North Korea.
[01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:38.455]  It was probably hacked from some agent working for Kim Jong-un, or whatever his name is.
[01:26:39.635 --> 01:26:44.079]  You know what I mean, as far as releasing that information goes.
[01:26:44.259 --> 01:26:47.001]  You're saying physically they don't have the components to do it?
[01:26:47.041 --> 01:26:50.504]  If it was Kim Jong-un, he'd have to hire a mercenary contractor?
[01:26:51.044 --> 01:26:56.009]  He'd have to, he'd have to, he'd have to go outside the country because their internet infrastructure sucks.
[01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:57.971]  I mean, literally.
[01:26:57.991 --> 01:27:05.038]  Yeah, I mean, they can't even keep their automobiles operating and their computers are about 30 years old.
[01:27:06.059 --> 01:27:15.167]  Yeah, yeah, and their connection, I believe they're getting most of their connections from China, which is just across the river, so, you know, who knows, right?
[01:27:16.732 --> 01:27:17.412]  Well, that's right.
[01:27:17.853 --> 01:27:26.678]  What do you make of them using the hack, as most evidence shows it was an inside job, using the hack as a pretext to pass things like SOPA and CISPA?
[01:27:28.079 --> 01:27:30.080]  Yeah, that's definitely true.
[01:27:30.781 --> 01:27:34.823]  You know, who knows really, really how it all happened.
[01:27:35.344 --> 01:27:37.165]  I'm sure they're going to keep that pretty secret.
[01:27:37.839 --> 01:27:42.881]  But the fact that it's an inside job doesn't surprise me in the least.
[01:27:43.622 --> 01:27:52.066]  I mean, I lived and worked near Hollywood for the greater portion of the last seven years and working for companies that
[01:27:53.146 --> 01:27:57.747]  That today would put YouTube out of business had we had our investors not backed out.
[01:27:58.248 --> 01:28:01.829]  But we were about ready to turn Hollywood on its side.
[01:28:02.469 --> 01:28:06.410]  And I understand how these movie companies work.
[01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:10.771]  Up until recently, the movie companies have been like military bases.
[01:28:11.272 --> 01:28:15.333]  You know, you can't get on these lots anymore.
[01:28:15.453 --> 01:28:16.913]  I mean, you used to have tour go through there?
[01:28:16.953 --> 01:28:17.714]  Not anymore.
[01:28:18.854 --> 01:28:21.895]  Because they're all really paranoid about their movies getting leaked out.
[01:28:23.953 --> 01:28:24.613]  Well, that's right.
[01:28:24.673 --> 01:28:32.235]  Even working at Sony, at their Blu-ray DVD plants, they body scan the employees up in Chicago to get in and out.
[01:28:33.235 --> 01:28:34.955]  Oh, it doesn't surprise me in the least.
[01:28:35.015 --> 01:28:43.957]  I suspect pretty much anybody that works for any of the movie companies, Warner Brothers, Fox, or whatever they are, they're all going to be very, very highly scrutinized.
[01:28:44.017 --> 01:28:48.598]  And a lot of these movie companies, they'll often share resources with other movie companies as well.
[01:28:49.058 --> 01:28:51.439]  Like Walt Disney might, you know, might work with
[01:28:53.639 --> 01:29:00.227]  NBC or with Universal Studios, and a lot of these studios have cross-pollination between them.
[01:29:00.727 --> 01:29:05.693]  So if one studio doesn't have the equipment, then another studio will pitch in and get whatever they need.
[01:29:05.713 --> 01:29:07.955]  That's right, interlocking corporate directorates.
[01:29:08.716 --> 01:29:11.039]  Absolutely, that's probably what it's all about, yeah.
[01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:12.020]  Sure.
[01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:15.524]  Well, that's what Davos, the Bilderberg Group, the New World Order is all about.
[01:29:15.984 --> 01:29:24.774]  A tiny cabal of really anti-free market people posing as capitalists trying to consolidate the world market under their control.
[01:29:25.655 --> 01:29:41.167]  When we come back in this next long segment, Captain Crunch, I want to talk to you about what you and your gut believe is coming in the future, what you're most concerned about, what you're most optimistic about, and will the human brain be hacked, or has it already been hacked by propaganda?
[01:29:41.427 --> 01:29:43.129]  But will it be digitally hacked?
[01:29:43.769 --> 01:29:45.250]  That and more is coming up.
[01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:46.070]  Here's the headline.
[01:29:46.110 --> 01:29:51.353]  Real-life matrix MIT researchers reveals interface that can allow a computer to plug into the brain.
[01:29:52.153 --> 01:29:54.874]  Where does he think humanity's going with the daddy of hacking?
[01:29:55.214 --> 01:29:56.475]  Captain Crunch straight ahead.
[01:29:56.495 --> 01:29:58.756]  InfoWars.com.
[01:29:59.997 --> 01:30:00.897]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.397 --> 01:30:02.998]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.919 --> 01:30:06.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.825 --> 01:30:19.492]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[01:30:19.813 --> 01:30:29.801]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:36.407]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:30:36.767 --> 01:30:42.912]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:30:43.172 --> 01:30:51.358]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:54.621]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:30:54.841 --> 01:30:56.022]  No needles, no injections.
[01:30:56.382 --> 01:30:57.703]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:30:57.783 --> 01:30:58.704]  Try it for yourself.
[01:30:58.984 --> 01:30:59.985]  Discover the secret.
[01:31:00.305 --> 01:31:00.625]  Secret 12.

[01:32:12.996 --> 01:32:16.637]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:32:16.657 --> 01:32:17.157]  Security alert.
[01:32:17.497 --> 01:32:18.517]  Security alert.
[01:32:18.718 --> 01:32:20.438]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:32:20.738 --> 01:32:21.358]  Analysis.
[01:32:21.598 --> 01:32:22.258]  InfoWars.
[01:32:22.318 --> 01:32:24.399]  Building independent media operations.
[01:32:24.419 --> 01:32:29.280]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:30.220]  Prime Directive.
[01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:31.800]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:34.661]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:34.741 --> 01:32:37.821]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:37.982 --> 01:32:40.142]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:40.282 --> 01:32:41.783]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:32:41.803 --> 01:32:44.025]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:44.625 --> 01:32:46.306]  They're never going to stop.
[01:32:46.587 --> 01:32:50.489]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:53.832]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:54.232 --> 01:32:56.874]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:32:57.594 --> 01:32:58.315]  Imperative.
[01:32:58.575 --> 01:33:00.596]  Destroy Britain's TV.
[01:33:00.617 --> 01:33:05.040]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:07.421]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[01:33:27.543 --> 01:33:32.064]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.725 --> 01:33:36.525]  We are in an info war.
[01:33:37.145 --> 01:33:40.366]  We have to have a fighting spirit and we have to support each other.
[01:33:41.146 --> 01:33:50.388]  That's what I've always tried to do with this platform, is bring other activists, other rebels, other freedom lovers on to magnify the work they're doing.
[01:33:51.445 --> 01:33:53.467]  And to help them when they're down.
[01:33:53.708 --> 01:33:55.369]  Like Captain Crunch was a few months ago.
[01:33:56.010 --> 01:33:59.874]  He sent us photos of him in the hospital and his disintegrating disc and all of it.
[01:34:00.175 --> 01:34:00.915]  He was down and out.
[01:34:01.736 --> 01:34:06.361]  And all the other companies, Apple, all the people he helped make hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:34:07.302 --> 01:34:09.703]  They obviously won't return his phone calls because they don't care.
[01:34:09.783 --> 01:34:11.783]  They're all about being self-centered.
[01:34:12.363 --> 01:34:24.066]  The Info War is about coming together and valuing freedom, realizing we're in a war, a war for our minds, breaking free from the social engineers, and then taking action against the globalists.
[01:34:24.546 --> 01:34:36.429]  Voting with our dollars, by purchasing products that promote liberty, not supporting globalist operations that hurt human liberty and health, like fast food chains that are dying.
[01:34:37.754 --> 01:34:38.794]  We have the power.
[01:34:38.834 --> 01:34:45.376]  In fact, there's a graphic on Infowars.com down at the bottom of the page where we have the daily cartoon that really illustrates this.
[01:34:45.396 --> 01:34:52.278]  It shows a politician out on a plank over a cliff on his lectern, you know, basically pointing at the sky.
[01:34:52.298 --> 01:34:54.118]  I guess they just updated it.
[01:34:55.118 --> 01:35:04.781]  And then it shows the population on the other end, and if they simply step off the plank, he's going to fall over the edge.
[01:35:05.808 --> 01:35:18.236]  A great way to reach out to people is to basically start a YouTube channel, start a local web blog, write a letter to the editor, call in to talk radio.
[01:35:18.816 --> 01:35:22.439]  Little things like that together will move mountains, will change the world.
[01:35:23.079 --> 01:35:23.980]  There's a new poll out.
[01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:27.222]  Large majority of Americans oppose Obama's immigration.
[01:35:28.599 --> 01:35:28.999]  Actions!
[01:35:29.079 --> 01:35:30.741]  Well, so does the Constitution and Bill of Rights!
[01:35:31.261 --> 01:35:36.185]  No other country would say, we'll let unlimited people in, and then give you free welfare.
[01:35:36.245 --> 01:35:37.025]  That's insane!
[01:35:37.766 --> 01:35:39.007]  Unless you want to bankrupt the nation.
[01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:45.231]  So again, the people actually are awake to a certain extent.
[01:35:45.932 --> 01:35:53.678]  That's why the establishment wants to divide and conquer us, and create all this different division at the grassroots, because that's the only way they can continue to operate.
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:56.822]  Please promote our local AM and FM affiliates.
[01:35:57.202 --> 01:35:59.083]  Tell your friends and family about the stations.
[01:35:59.643 --> 01:36:00.844]  That's why we're growing.
[01:36:00.904 --> 01:36:02.165]  Not just because we get ratings.
[01:36:02.525 --> 01:36:04.226]  Not just because the broadcast is interesting.
[01:36:04.546 --> 01:36:05.347]  Truth is interesting.
[01:36:05.987 --> 01:36:06.888]  Freedom is interesting.
[01:36:07.952 --> 01:36:12.394]  But also because you, the listeners, are telling friends and family about the stations.
[01:36:12.714 --> 01:36:14.115]  You are thanking the sponsors.
[01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:15.856]  You are becoming sponsors.
[01:36:16.156 --> 01:36:17.016]  And I want to thank you.
[01:36:17.537 --> 01:36:32.884]  It's also key to support InfoWarsStore.com with the best made in America, pro-gun, pro-liberty, anti-socialist, anti-tyranny, long-sleeve shirts, short-sleeve shirts, women's shirts, Molon Labe, come and take it.
[01:36:33.724 --> 01:36:40.426]  Uh, the new Molon Labe brass belt buckles with the M16s and with the Spartan helmets.
[01:36:41.426 --> 01:36:43.667]  Uh, we got more of the camouflage shirts in.
[01:36:43.987 --> 01:36:44.947]  They sold out again.
[01:36:44.987 --> 01:36:46.027]  We've got even more coming.
[01:36:46.648 --> 01:36:53.670]  Uh, so this is how we fund our operation is info or store dot com or call toll free 888.
[01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.971]  253-3139.
[01:36:55.991 --> 01:37:09.722]  And we've also got super high quality Nutramedicals at Infowars, Life.com, The Survival Shield, Nacin Iodine X2.
[01:37:09.762 --> 01:37:12.344]  You've heard the reviews, you've heard what callers say it's done.
[01:37:13.145 --> 01:37:21.512]  This is the only brand we know of, because we went out and had it developed, that is from crystal deep earth, pure, real iodine.
[01:37:22.483 --> 01:37:27.286]  Not processed stuff out of seaweed that they claim is nascent iodine and isn't.
[01:37:28.407 --> 01:37:32.029]  Nascent iodine turns bright blue on paper, not black or red.
[01:37:33.069 --> 01:37:34.470]  No one else's that we've seen.
[01:37:34.911 --> 01:37:38.873]  Believe me, when we were selling out of it, we were trying to find another distributor, another place to get it.
[01:37:39.233 --> 01:37:43.216]  We finally found another with even more deep earth crystals, and that's what we've got here.
[01:37:43.236 --> 01:37:45.257]  I mean, this is hard to get, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:46.017 --> 01:37:48.459]  The raw stuff, before it goes into the organic palm oil,
[01:37:49.631 --> 01:37:50.172]  Gases.
[01:37:50.992 --> 01:37:55.056]  A little crystal, a little blue-purple crystal turns into purple gas.
[01:37:55.176 --> 01:38:04.384]  I mean, that's what this stuff does in your body, is it just races through, grabbing the bad halogens, binding to them, and taking them out.
[01:38:04.424 --> 01:38:05.686]  Now, you will detox.
[01:38:07.185 --> 01:38:12.611]  I mean, I recommend you take a low dose of this when you first take it or talk to your physician, whatever you do, because this is not a game, okay?
[01:38:13.392 --> 01:38:14.373]  This is not a game.
[01:38:15.714 --> 01:38:17.136]  This is something you'll die without.
[01:38:18.177 --> 01:38:21.941]  And then the forms of iodine we have are just not the truly pure forms.
[01:38:22.501 --> 01:38:24.984]  So that's why InfoWarsX2 is so special.
[01:38:25.585 --> 01:38:26.646]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:38:27.927 --> 01:38:39.091]  You can get two bottles of it right now at the regular discounted price, and then get a free bottle of Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Formula 2-ounce bottle, a $14.99 value, absolutely free.
[01:38:39.751 --> 01:38:42.672]  And all these specials end in the next few days.
[01:38:42.692 --> 01:38:46.513]  The free shipping on all the water filtration systems, that ends.
[01:38:47.093 --> 01:38:49.014]  The 10% off promo code WATER continues.
[01:38:49.574 --> 01:38:50.795]  A whole bunch of other specials.
[01:38:52.975 --> 01:38:57.238]  Almost half off, it's almost half off on the Nightly News, PrisonPlanet.tv subscriptions.
[01:38:57.658 --> 01:39:02.361]  All that ends at the start of the new month, so thank you all for your support.
[01:39:02.761 --> 01:39:19.612]  That said, I want to go to calls, Captain Crunch, Abel, Julio, Jacob, Patton, and many others that have called in 800-259-9231, but I want to get into your latest project, but first, those big gestalts, those big questions.
[01:39:20.868 --> 01:39:21.889]  You're a trailblazer.
[01:39:21.949 --> 01:39:32.118]  We could spend three hours talking about all the wild stuff you've done, the amazing stuff, things the Pentagon thought was impossible, things you showed them, things they then employed against the Russians and other folks.
[01:39:33.078 --> 01:39:34.059]  A lot of it classified.
[01:39:34.079 --> 01:39:37.502]  We can't, obviously, probably can't get into a lot of it, or you would and maybe get in trouble.
[01:39:38.183 --> 01:39:41.806]  But before we go any further, where does your gut tell you humanity's going?
[01:39:42.186 --> 01:39:44.408]  What do you think of the NSA takeover?
[01:39:44.688 --> 01:39:46.169]  What do you think of the global elite?
[01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:47.891]  Where do you see humanity going?
[01:39:49.232 --> 01:39:50.433]  Well, that's a good question.
[01:39:51.414 --> 01:39:52.475]  It's really hard to tell.
[01:39:52.616 --> 01:39:55.599]  I was really so surprised when the Snowden revolutions came out.
[01:39:55.739 --> 01:39:57.541]  Actually, I really wasn't that surprised.
[01:39:57.901 --> 01:40:04.088]  I kind of suspected that they had access to the ability of decrypting like PGP and things like that.
[01:40:04.548 --> 01:40:10.333]  I mean, if you use a ridiculously small key, yeah, they're going to crack your PGP code for sure.
[01:40:11.614 --> 01:40:18.360]  But if you use OTR like Wicker, W-I-C-K-R, for Android and iPad or iPhone, that's really great.
[01:40:19.081 --> 01:40:24.226]  I want to just mention something that I'm working on here, which really goes in line with protecting your privacy.
[01:40:24.726 --> 01:40:27.569]  And Glenn Greenwald, listen to this because you're going to love this.
[01:40:28.089 --> 01:40:35.477]  We've designed and successfully created an amazing security product that we're very excited to share more details with the general public.
[01:40:35.797 --> 01:40:43.286]  We're still in stealth mode, currently conducting real-world testing with small companies in non-disposed cities.
[01:40:43.786 --> 01:40:48.951]  Evaluating results, refining and making tweaks to accommodate a much larger audience very soon.
[01:40:48.971 --> 01:40:55.677]  We're focusing on a public launch on the 4th of July, 2015, Internet Independence Day.
[01:40:56.117 --> 01:40:59.000]  Starting this summer, you will be able to use Thundercloud.
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:12.085]  In the comfort of your own home or business with any existing software, operating system, or device, we've created our own cryptographic language that is completely independent of any existing security technology.
[01:41:12.465 --> 01:41:18.167]  Our strength is built within our proprietary design of the public and private cryptographic keys.
[01:41:18.627 --> 01:41:23.549]  These use a 1 billion bit key that rotates randomly every 5 seconds.
[01:41:24.029 --> 01:41:26.190]  These keys are controlled entirely by the user.
[01:41:26.670 --> 01:41:28.372]  No information is ever stored.
[01:41:28.732 --> 01:41:33.556]  The size of our standard encryption key is in excess of a terabyte data block.
[01:41:33.997 --> 01:41:46.568]  However, this is also a key factor of what makes our technology so exciting, since it's transmitted in the space of 200 kilobytes and will confirm to any existing method of data storage or communication without any overhead.
[01:41:47.128 --> 01:41:55.254]  Most security keys range from 128-bit to 4096-bits, and these are easily transmittable and transmitted in fairly small.
[01:41:55.535 --> 01:42:01.880]  Since these keys are so small, cracking security keys in this size is fairly easy with enough computational power.
[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:07.324]  Existing security and cryptographic technology that is in use is no longer safe.
[01:42:07.384 --> 01:42:08.505]  In recent events, even
[01:42:09.185 --> 01:42:19.489]  RSA Crypto was discovered to have backdoors, and our system is designed from the ground up to be impossible to breach or forcibly decode.
[01:42:19.869 --> 01:42:31.454]  Using every supercomputer in the world in tandem, it is estimated that the processes take over 30 million years, or 4-5 seconds worth of transmitted or stored information.
[01:42:32.134 --> 01:42:38.156]  Our website will officially soft launch February 13, 2015, mythundercloud.com.
[01:42:38.816 --> 01:42:41.256]  At this time, there will be a sign-up page available.
[01:42:41.296 --> 01:42:44.877]  We will be inviting users to sign up for our closed public beta.
[01:42:45.377 --> 01:42:47.818]  Invitations will be limited to only 1,000 users.
[01:42:48.198 --> 01:42:49.498]  So first come, first serve.
[01:42:49.839 --> 01:42:50.859]  Mark it on your calendar.
[01:42:51.099 --> 01:42:52.899]  This is a date you don't want to miss.
[01:42:53.579 --> 01:42:59.021]  We will never keep track of our users or attempt to monetize their privacy by design.
[01:42:59.781 --> 01:43:04.865]  There is no tracking elements built in and to add them would be technically impossible.
[01:43:05.285 --> 01:43:11.149]  Our product is designed by the necessity to keep our freedom free.
[01:43:11.489 --> 01:43:18.654]  And the nice thing about it is you can travel across international borders and they're not going to be able to examine your data at all.
[01:43:18.954 --> 01:43:20.135]  It's so cool.
[01:43:20.275 --> 01:43:21.196]  That's what I want!
[01:43:21.276 --> 01:43:24.598]  Well, pop in for a 10-15 minute interview the day you launch that.
[01:43:24.618 --> 01:43:26.800]  I know you're working with some top folks on that.
[01:43:27.847 --> 01:43:29.108]  And that's very, very exciting.
[01:43:29.509 --> 01:43:31.191]  Captain Crunch... I'm honored to do so.
[01:43:31.511 --> 01:43:32.092]  You bet, brother.
[01:43:32.893 --> 01:43:34.274]  Captain Crunch is our guest.
[01:43:34.675 --> 01:43:40.701]  Captain Crunch, I want to go to some of these Twitter questions and phone calls now, if there isn't anything else you want to get to first.
[01:43:41.522 --> 01:43:43.124]  Oh no, I'm pretty much cool about that.
[01:43:43.184 --> 01:43:43.505]  Go ahead.
[01:43:44.651 --> 01:43:51.975]  What does Captain Crunch think ex-Zach-to-Mount-Ass, at Twitter, that's a mouthful, these handles.
[01:43:52.815 --> 01:43:54.936]  What does Captain Crunch think about AI?
[01:43:55.457 --> 01:43:59.178]  How does he see technology going in the next five to ten years?
[01:43:59.639 --> 01:44:03.901]  I guess that ties into my question about these wirehead interfaces.
[01:44:04.501 --> 01:44:06.962]  Will people recede into the Matrix?
[01:44:07.423 --> 01:44:09.163]  I mean, what's your gut about technology?
[01:44:09.203 --> 01:44:10.384]  What's your view on AI?
[01:44:11.365 --> 01:44:13.586]  Well, it sounds like it's kind of going that way, doesn't it?
[01:44:14.514 --> 01:44:24.697]  I mean, with facial recognition, speech recognition, and with drones, of course, and all these other technologies that are out there.
[01:44:24.717 --> 01:44:27.098]  I mean, I was at the CES show in Las Vegas.
[01:44:27.418 --> 01:44:34.960]  These people are coming out here to Bangkok, and I was very impressed with what they've got out there, you know what I mean, at the CES show.
[01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:40.541]  You know, they have all these different products out there, you know, like 3D printers, you know.
[01:44:41.022 --> 01:44:42.002]  Who'd ever thought, right?
[01:44:43.092 --> 01:44:45.013]  You could print your own favorite little item.
[01:44:45.334 --> 01:44:53.820]  Yeah, there's amazing applications for humanity, but I look at the establishment that craves power and nothing more, and craves monopoly.
[01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:57.222]  They're just already creating hellish stuff.
[01:44:57.322 --> 01:45:02.325]  Autonomous drones, the British named theirs, BAE Systems named it tyranny.
[01:45:03.306 --> 01:45:14.371]  Also, I might want to add that there's also a drone bot out now that can basically trojan into your AR drone.
[01:45:14.731 --> 01:45:17.732]  That's made by Parrot, a company in France.
[01:45:18.693 --> 01:45:21.494]  You use your iPhone to control a quadrocopter.
[01:45:22.114 --> 01:45:29.017]  And I saw a video of a demonstration of somebody planting a trojan into a drone.
[01:45:30.734 --> 01:45:31.715]  We are aware of that.
[01:45:31.775 --> 01:45:45.928]  What do you make of the Internet of Things and this article by Paul Watson that's up on InfoWars.com where the British government is announcing that they're going to be hacking into all the smart cars and taxing you and also controlling your speed, you name it.
[01:45:46.268 --> 01:45:47.990]  I mean, they are really flaunting this.
[01:45:49.031 --> 01:45:50.592]  Oh, that's crazy.
[01:45:50.872 --> 01:45:51.833]  That's totally nuts.
[01:45:51.933 --> 01:45:52.974]  I can't believe they're doing that.
[01:45:53.334 --> 01:45:54.135]  That's just nuts.
[01:45:56.697 --> 01:45:56.958]  I mean,
[01:46:00.268 --> 01:46:12.571]  I actually saw a demonstration of a hack into a car system, I think it was a Chevy, I'm not sure what it was, but they actually hacked into the car and they were able to basically
[01:46:15.902 --> 01:46:17.223]  Take out the braking system.
[01:46:18.444 --> 01:46:20.525]  And I've seen this demonstrated on YouTube.
[01:46:20.585 --> 01:46:23.647]  So, there are hacks out there for cars right now.
[01:46:23.667 --> 01:46:23.827]  Sure.
[01:46:24.147 --> 01:46:25.388]  And who knows where it's going.
[01:46:25.568 --> 01:46:26.929]  Well, we know what happened on 9-11.
[01:46:26.949 --> 01:46:30.071]  There's a lot of evidence those jet aircraft were actually hacked.
[01:46:30.091 --> 01:46:33.053]  Nerve gas was released and then they could get rid of the Patsy's.
[01:46:33.434 --> 01:46:35.295]  The question is who did the hacking?
[01:46:35.715 --> 01:46:38.517]  And those planes were fitted with those systems.
[01:46:39.017 --> 01:46:40.038]  Here's another question.
[01:46:40.398 --> 01:46:43.600]  Will there be a time when humanity wishes for an EMP?
[01:46:45.003 --> 01:46:47.460]  Electromagnetic pulse reset of technology.
[01:46:48.905 --> 01:46:52.467]  Well, that... I don't know, that's kind of wishful thinking.
[01:46:52.827 --> 01:46:55.408]  But I do want to have to... I do have to say something.
[01:46:55.468 --> 01:46:57.969]  In my years of experience in the U.S.
[01:46:58.749 --> 01:47:14.676]  Air Force, 64-68, I was definitely briefed on the effects of nuclear explosions, and in fact, I personally have... I have actually... I'm one of very few people that have actually witnessed a fireball explosion of a nuke going off in Nevada in 1962.
[01:47:16.677 --> 01:47:24.005]  Uh, one of the tests in Nevada, and I know firsthand what one of those nukes can do to, uh, to your electronics.
[01:47:24.085 --> 01:47:34.557]  And this, remember this, I was driving, I was in a car that had a 12-volt system, it had a tube radio, and the radio was totally toast, the ignition system was totally toast.
[01:47:35.317 --> 01:47:37.099]  And we weren't that far away from Ground Zero.
[01:47:37.139 --> 01:47:39.401]  We somehow managed to slip through the checkpoints.
[01:47:39.761 --> 01:47:43.124]  We got about as close as we can get to Ground Zero before that sucker went off.
[01:47:43.905 --> 01:47:46.407]  And, uh, I was in the driver's side of the car.
[01:47:46.908 --> 01:47:51.231]  And I can remember I had my hand out, hanging out the window when that fireball went off.
[01:47:52.072 --> 01:47:55.794]  And, uh, you know, I noticed I got a nasty blistering on my arm afterwards.
[01:47:56.494 --> 01:48:05.798]  And, uh, then, then when the shockwave hit, we, luckily, we had to position the car in such a way that it wouldn't knock us off the road, because you could see this big wall of dust coming toward us, toward our car.
[01:48:06.318 --> 01:48:07.519]  And this is crazy, man.
[01:48:07.559 --> 01:48:11.060]  I mean, it took us, we, we never did get to radio fix.
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:12.161]  It was just totally toast.
[01:48:12.561 --> 01:48:16.682]  Uh, we had to rewire our ignition wires of our car because of the EMP effects.
[01:48:16.722 --> 01:48:17.603]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:48:18.724 --> 01:48:22.085]  And, sir, you don't want to have any of P. Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:48:22.105 --> 01:48:23.185]  You don't want one of those.
[01:48:23.545 --> 01:48:28.467]  Let's go to some phone calls here for Captain Crunch, who's on the line with us right now.
[01:48:28.787 --> 01:48:30.387]  We've got more Twitter questions coming up.
[01:48:30.607 --> 01:48:33.308]  Abel, then we'll go to Patton and then Julio and others.
[01:48:33.708 --> 01:48:34.528]  Abel, you're on the air.
[01:48:35.849 --> 01:48:36.149]  Hello?
[01:48:36.449 --> 01:48:36.649]  Yes.
[01:48:37.849 --> 01:48:38.770]  Hi, Alex Jones.
[01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:40.430]  First off, I just want to give you kudos.
[01:48:40.730 --> 01:48:45.371]  I know you hate to be thanked or whatever the shit is, but you are the man.
[01:48:45.411 --> 01:48:46.732]  I'm watching you right now on the prison planet.
[01:48:47.614 --> 01:48:52.158]  I just want to give, I've been watching this and man, it's an honor to be on this show.
[01:48:53.519 --> 01:48:55.041]  John, it's awesome.
[01:48:55.141 --> 01:49:01.626]  I am a noob, but what I can say is since I've been watching, I got into you through Alex Jones, and I am thankful to God.
[01:49:01.806 --> 01:49:06.511]  I give thanks to God that your show is on, that you're able to reach people.
[01:49:06.731 --> 01:49:07.732]  I tell my family about you.
[01:49:08.212 --> 01:49:11.875]  Anyways, I'm interested in communication.
[01:49:11.915 --> 01:49:12.556]  I want to be able
[01:49:13.214 --> 01:49:15.196]  Let's say the stuff hits the fan, right?
[01:49:15.616 --> 01:49:17.878]  I want to be able to keep in touch with my family.
[01:49:18.138 --> 01:49:21.941]  I want to be able to be independent, to have my own sources, you know?
[01:49:21.961 --> 01:49:22.822]  That's awesome, Abel.
[01:49:22.862 --> 01:49:26.645]  The first big part of communication is turn off your radio when you call and talk radio.
[01:49:27.185 --> 01:49:29.527]  Because then we can hear you and not the echo.
[01:49:29.887 --> 01:49:32.189]  So turn your radio off and then go ahead and ask your question.
[01:49:33.711 --> 01:49:36.613]  Awesome.
[01:49:36.713 --> 01:49:39.115]  Basically, I would... Okay, theoretically, I would just...
[01:49:39.682 --> 01:49:43.524]  I love the idea of having my own cell phone, my own independent cell phone, just me.
[01:49:43.824 --> 01:49:44.605]  Like, you know what I'm saying?
[01:49:44.885 --> 01:49:49.788]  More and more there are private networks and groups setting up communities via Skype and things.
[01:49:49.808 --> 01:49:52.369]  I remember one of our IT guys like six, seven, eight years ago.
[01:49:52.389 --> 01:49:53.890]  Mesh networks.
[01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:55.871]  Mesh networks.
[01:49:56.691 --> 01:49:59.052]  Abel, that's a great idea and it's being done.
[01:49:59.093 --> 01:50:01.454]  Let's get Captain Crunch's take on that.
[01:50:01.914 --> 01:50:03.435]  What do you think of Abel's question or comment?
[01:50:04.954 --> 01:50:07.235]  Yeah, I think people need to have better communication.
[01:50:08.015 --> 01:50:09.916]  You know, one of the apps I use is Wicker.
[01:50:10.316 --> 01:50:11.016]  W-I-C-K-E-R.
[01:50:11.036 --> 01:50:13.097]  It uses perfect foreign security.
[01:50:13.697 --> 01:50:15.458]  It's OTR off the record.
[01:50:15.518 --> 01:50:17.358]  No record of the conversations being made.
[01:50:17.378 --> 01:50:20.099]  256 AES, no-grade encryption.
[01:50:20.119 --> 01:50:22.780]  And it's very easy to use.
[01:50:24.241 --> 01:50:24.981]  Well, that's what's great.
[01:50:25.021 --> 01:50:27.942]  All these wonderful apps are coming out that have so many layers built in.
[01:50:28.362 --> 01:50:32.143]  And notice the NSA and others want encryption stopped.
[01:50:32.223 --> 01:50:37.145]  Obama has been saying, oh, because of Charlie Hebdo, we need to get rid of encryption for the public.
[01:50:37.465 --> 01:50:39.746]  Those guys were public about what they were going to do.
[01:50:40.086 --> 01:50:41.606]  You can't take our right to privacy away.
[01:50:41.686 --> 01:50:43.207]  It'll never happen.
[01:50:43.267 --> 01:50:44.347]  It'll never happen.
[01:50:44.927 --> 01:50:46.327]  Because you know what's going to happen?
[01:50:48.048 --> 01:50:51.129]  All the crooks will have encryption and the John Q. public won't.
[01:50:53.154 --> 01:50:55.869]  But exactly, the government has no right to keep encryption away from us.
[01:50:58.493 --> 01:51:00.134]  Yeah, just like guns, absolutely.
[01:51:00.154 --> 01:51:01.175]  Is that what you just said?
[01:51:01.835 --> 01:51:09.000]  Yeah, exactly, I mean, and what's the old saying, uh, ban guns and all the criminals have guns and people won't have them.
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:10.501]  Absolutely, common sense.
[01:51:10.801 --> 01:51:13.723]  This hour brought to you by InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[01:52:09.930 --> 01:52:14.873]  Did you know by age 50, half of all men have an enlarged prostate?
[01:52:15.294 --> 01:52:21.798]  This means more urges to urinate, longer bathroom trips, waking at night to urinate, or issues with sex.

[01:53:01.276 --> 01:53:02.177]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:53:02.197 --> 01:53:04.419]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:53:04.459 --> 01:53:05.119]  A pair of scissors.
[01:53:16.568 --> 01:53:22.072]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[01:53:22.352 --> 01:53:27.036]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:53:27.276 --> 01:53:28.097]  The phone line.
[01:53:28.257 --> 01:53:33.180]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:53:33.521 --> 01:53:37.304]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:53:37.444 --> 01:53:40.306]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[01:54:44.772 --> 01:54:46.073]  Captain Crunch is our guest.
[01:54:46.393 --> 01:54:46.713]  Patton.
[01:54:47.714 --> 01:54:55.778]  When we start the next hour, I'm going to blitz news, take your phone calls on a host of subjects, a bunch of special reports, jam-packed third hour, key information coming up.
[01:54:56.098 --> 01:54:59.880]  Patton, in FEMA Region 4, you're on the air with Captain Crunch.
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:02.341]  Yes, Alex.
[01:55:02.401 --> 01:55:02.681]  Ditto.
[01:55:03.727 --> 01:55:13.232]  Uh, I had put out some signs all around town here and I'm going to Knoxville next and I want to, next time I get some money, I want to put some billboards up.
[01:55:14.273 --> 01:55:15.594]  Okay.
[01:55:15.774 --> 01:55:17.655]  Uh, I've been thinking, excuse me.
[01:55:18.055 --> 01:55:18.856]  No, I said, thank you, sir.
[01:55:20.136 --> 01:55:20.476]  Okay.
[01:55:20.937 --> 01:55:23.158]  I have been thinking of a couple of ways.
[01:55:23.378 --> 01:55:25.639]  I want to fire a broadside volley.
[01:55:27.293 --> 01:55:32.717]  Straight at the face of the New World Order, and I've thought of two ideas that I can maybe do that.
[01:55:32.838 --> 01:55:33.798]  Maybe you'll agree with me.
[01:55:34.819 --> 01:55:36.821]  I want to appeal for my republic.
[01:55:36.901 --> 01:55:38.002]  I'm not above begging.
[01:55:38.862 --> 01:55:42.666]  I want to appeal to Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu.
[01:55:42.726 --> 01:55:46.569]  They have two of the best intelligence gathering services of the world.
[01:55:47.549 --> 01:55:55.016]  I know they have the information we need to bring down the criminals, Barack Obama and John Boehner.
[01:55:57.381 --> 01:56:00.842]  I know they have the information we need to bring those two down.
[01:56:01.063 --> 01:56:14.148]  If we can get real Americans back into our government, we can stop those sanctions, this crippled Russia's economy, and we can move forward together in peace.
[01:56:14.208 --> 01:56:15.968]  There's no need for another world war.
[01:56:17.697 --> 01:56:20.501]  Just because a few globalists think they can profit from it.
[01:56:20.721 --> 01:56:34.220]  I agree with you Patton and undoubtedly you're gonna have problems in government always but we have people running our government bipartisanly that premeditatedly want to wreck the country to take it over and want to turn us into a totalitarian system.
[01:56:35.316 --> 01:56:36.177]  It's very dangerous.
[01:56:36.697 --> 01:56:37.497]  Thank you for the call.
[01:56:37.858 --> 01:56:39.739]  Captain Crunch, that's an important call.
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:52.747]  I'm not lionizing, as I've said a thousand times, probably 500 times, exaggerated a thousand, but I've said hundreds of times, I'm not lionizing Putin, but the West is starting to fight with Russia.
[01:56:53.367 --> 01:56:54.148]  And why?
[01:56:54.548 --> 01:56:55.449]  For special interest.
[01:56:56.670 --> 01:57:00.192]  What do you think about the state of the world and what America has turned into?
[01:57:01.502 --> 01:57:04.563]  You know, I don't think we should be picking on Russia right now, really.
[01:57:05.524 --> 01:57:11.686]  I mean, you know, I mean, they've got things that are very helpful to us and we should help them and they should help us.
[01:57:11.806 --> 01:57:18.428]  I don't understand why... Yeah, we should engage in commerce and trade with them, not try to steal their oil and gas lines and cut them off.
[01:57:18.448 --> 01:57:19.629]  I mean, what is the point of that?
[01:57:20.799 --> 01:57:25.822]  Yeah, I mean, I met some really amazingly, amazingly great people in Russia.
[01:57:25.882 --> 01:57:26.603]  I was there in Russia.
[01:57:26.623 --> 01:57:27.703]  I went there twice, you know?
[01:57:28.544 --> 01:57:30.305]  And they're normal people, just like us.
[01:57:30.885 --> 01:57:35.448]  And, you know, I mean, their government is different than ours, and we just have to accept that.
[01:57:36.809 --> 01:57:37.729]  Well, I know this.
[01:57:39.110 --> 01:57:42.512]  We have George Soros and others offensively trying to start a war with him.
[01:57:42.753 --> 01:57:43.393]  We got U.S.
[01:57:43.453 --> 01:57:46.275]  mercs fighting and killing and dying against Spetsnaz.
[01:57:46.955 --> 01:57:47.836]  This is dangerous.
[01:57:48.928 --> 01:57:49.848]  I agree with you there.
[01:58:20.158 --> 01:58:24.160]  Uh, webcrunchers.com is my personal website.
[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:26.961]  And, uh, I've got a lot of blogs there.
[01:58:26.981 --> 01:58:34.683]  A lot of blogs in there have been mentioning the trials and tribulations of my healing and my stint in the hospital and my recovery.
[01:58:35.624 --> 01:58:37.644]  And, uh, of course, I'm always on Facebook.
[01:58:37.704 --> 01:58:38.204]  It's J.D.
[01:58:38.285 --> 01:58:39.045]  Crunchman.
[01:58:39.545 --> 01:58:42.066]  Uh, Gmail, Facebook, Skype.
[01:58:42.086 --> 01:58:42.866]  It's all J.D.
[01:58:42.946 --> 01:58:44.607]  Crunchman, so you can't really miss me.
[01:58:44.647 --> 01:58:46.007]  Well, you're doing a great job.
[01:58:46.067 --> 01:58:46.527]  Stay there.
[01:58:46.587 --> 01:58:47.308]  Back in 70 seconds.

[02:00:16.601 --> 02:00:20.766]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:21.446 --> 02:00:22.247]  You want answers?
[02:00:23.028 --> 02:00:23.929]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.570 --> 02:00:28.194]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.754 --> 02:00:32.819]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:39.532 --> 02:00:44.773]  Coming up after Zuckerberg says we are all Charlie, Facebook censors Muhammad images.
[02:00:45.094 --> 02:00:46.134]  I've got that in my stack.
[02:00:46.174 --> 02:00:47.034]  I've got to get to it.
[02:00:47.054 --> 02:00:49.674]  This is the total hypocrisy of these people.
[02:00:50.455 --> 02:00:56.136]  While they censor our pro-gun promotions and non-violent stuff constantly on Facebook, people say, well, why are you there?
[02:00:56.156 --> 02:00:56.996]  Because I'm not giving up.
[02:00:57.436 --> 02:00:59.976]  They don't want me there because I'm effective.
[02:01:00.637 --> 02:01:02.177]  We're going to go in there and reach the sheeple.
[02:01:03.206 --> 02:01:04.447]  That's all coming up in the next segment.
[02:01:04.867 --> 02:01:08.349]  Julio and then Al are the only callers we have time for with Captain Crunch.
[02:01:09.170 --> 02:01:09.750]  You're on the air.
[02:01:09.890 --> 02:01:13.353]  Julio with the first and top hacker, Captain Crunch.
[02:01:13.393 --> 02:01:13.733]  Go ahead.
[02:01:15.011 --> 02:01:16.352]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:01:16.392 --> 02:01:17.753]  Good morning, Mr. Draper.
[02:01:18.053 --> 02:01:23.237]  An interesting document I just came across, the FBI's information sharing document of 2011.
[02:01:23.397 --> 02:01:25.279]  It's quite interesting.
[02:01:25.319 --> 02:01:37.187]  It goes into the biometric center of excellence that stores face, voice recognition, DNA recognition, and fingerprint technologies.
[02:01:37.227 --> 02:01:38.809]  It's quite interesting and people want to look that up.
[02:01:39.149 --> 02:01:41.731]  Mr. Draper, my question to you is about
[02:01:42.513 --> 02:01:44.133]  Peer-to-peer and torrenting.
[02:01:45.234 --> 02:01:48.794]  Since I moved to Wyoming from Chicago, I decided to ditch TV.
[02:01:50.235 --> 02:01:53.175]  I torrent stream anything I watch.
[02:01:53.715 --> 02:01:56.336]  I'm a big advocate of torrent and peer-to-peer technology.
[02:01:56.356 --> 02:01:58.916]  I wanted to get your thoughts on what the future of that is.
[02:01:59.416 --> 02:02:08.358]  Do you have any recommendations on private, secure, peer-to-peer type ways that people can communicate or share information?
[02:02:09.255 --> 02:02:11.657]  Yeah, I have some things to say about torrenting, for sure.
[02:02:13.017 --> 02:02:28.367]  Torrenting, of course, is the ability of being able to share information across multiple servers, and so one no-one server actually has the actual movie that you're interested in downloading.
[02:02:28.847 --> 02:02:38.713]  If you are using some of these ISPs in America, like ComCraft, I mean Comcast, or Cox, especially Cox,
[02:02:39.233 --> 02:02:42.314]  And if you're using torrenting, they are watching you.
[02:02:42.654 --> 02:02:58.277]  The best thing you can do to get around torrenting is to get on a VPN or some way to mask your IP address and also offer encryption.
[02:02:59.497 --> 02:03:01.977]  You can also get on by sending an SSH pipe.
[02:03:05.131 --> 02:03:08.272]  Into it, and from that, all of your data will be encrypted.
[02:03:08.293 --> 02:03:12.735]  So your ISP can't really tell whether or not you're actually running a torrent.
[02:03:12.775 --> 02:03:13.575]  Thank you, Julio.
[02:03:13.975 --> 02:03:16.076]  And the media tries to act like this is because you're a criminal.
[02:03:16.556 --> 02:03:19.258]  No, it's because they have no business on video.
[02:03:19.298 --> 02:03:26.681]  Whether it's an Alex Jones video, or some open source video, or whatever it is, it's not their business to preemptively be surveilling you.
[02:03:27.381 --> 02:03:29.182]  Let's go ahead and talk to Al in Maryland.
[02:03:29.222 --> 02:03:29.842]  Thanks for calling.
[02:03:29.862 --> 02:03:30.943]  You're on the air with Captain Crunch.
[02:03:32.335 --> 02:03:33.136]  Yeah, thanks guys.
[02:03:33.176 --> 02:03:49.986]  Hey, don't you think it's time for people to start creating their own individual servers and get rid of the government ogle, which is Google, so that we can start a tax revolt in this country, Tosh Plumlee style, a swarm, and get this place back on track and out of the hands of the Soros Nazis.
[02:03:52.287 --> 02:03:53.488]  Sounds like a good plan to me.
[02:03:53.508 --> 02:03:54.349]  Anything else, Al?
[02:03:56.297 --> 02:04:16.270]  Well, I just think if we don't coagulate in blood on the streets, and I'm not talking about violence, I'm talking about physical beings having our own servers where we can communicate without these dogs barking at our ankles all day long, we're going to be able to get something done because the other way it's all blockage and it's all extortion and it's got to happen now.
[02:04:17.391 --> 02:04:21.254]  I know this, you know, these bankers have created a system where they put pressure on us
[02:04:22.079 --> 02:04:25.062]  Well, they're robbing us, and then they use the crisis to get more power.
[02:04:25.462 --> 02:04:31.167]  They've got all the angles figured out, except us figuring out that it's all a game, all a scam, and they're crooks.
[02:04:31.707 --> 02:04:34.189]  That's why at Davos... Captain Crunch, sorry.
[02:04:34.730 --> 02:04:44.518]  Yeah, you can get hosting services relatively inexpensively, just for ten bucks a month, and one more thing I wanted to mention, Alex, you asked me whether or not I had any websites.
[02:04:45.158 --> 02:04:51.143]  One really important website that I'm involved with is gofreakmedia.com.
[02:04:52.044 --> 02:04:59.830]  This website, they're into cosplay and into MMA and a lot of really cool things that young people really like to get into.
[02:04:59.890 --> 02:05:01.892]  And I've been writing a lot of articles for them.
[02:05:02.372 --> 02:05:05.015]  John Draper, thank you so much, Captain Crunch.
[02:05:05.035 --> 02:05:09.238]  We'll have you back on to pop in when you launch this new Internet Freedom Initiative.
[02:05:09.258 --> 02:05:09.879]  Thank you so much.

[02:07:13.764 --> 02:07:19.108]  And now, this winter has been the worst on record when it comes to our immune systems and health.
[02:07:19.388 --> 02:07:28.435]  For more than two years, InfoWarsLife.com has been watching this crisis intensify, and Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Complex was our answer.

[02:08:12.142 --> 02:08:14.604]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:15.645 --> 02:08:20.350]  Some people say a man is made out of mud.
[02:08:20.370 --> 02:08:23.753]  A poor man's made out of muscle and blood.
[02:08:24.353 --> 02:08:27.176]  Muscle and blood and skin and bones.
[02:08:27.556 --> 02:08:30.399]  A mind that's weak and a back that's strong.
[02:08:30.439 --> 02:08:30.960]  You load 16 tons.
[02:08:32.781 --> 02:08:47.714]  All right, Rob Dew has combined three reports from the nightly news in the last few weeks with the latest data as the death toll from the flu vaccines is directly connected to it, intensifies.
[02:08:47.754 --> 02:08:54.400]  And again, they admit it gives you no protection from the flu, lowers your immune system, can give you guillain-barre, epilepsy, you name it.
[02:08:54.420 --> 02:08:55.141]  So that's on record.
[02:08:55.501 --> 02:08:57.023]  But so many children are dying.
[02:08:57.723 --> 02:09:01.027]  After they get the flu shot, here is this special report.
[02:09:01.047 --> 02:09:03.269]  We're not going to have time to air it all, but about 95% of it.
[02:09:03.569 --> 02:09:04.911]  Then we'll go to break, come back.
[02:09:04.991 --> 02:09:06.813]  I'm going to news blitz intensely.
[02:09:07.013 --> 02:09:09.996]  ISIS says they'll cut off Obama's head.
[02:09:10.076 --> 02:09:11.958]  Why would they cut off their chief patron's head?
[02:09:12.299 --> 02:09:13.380]  This is total theater.
[02:09:14.241 --> 02:09:17.504]  We're going to get into the government's announced plans to remote control your car.
[02:09:17.524 --> 02:09:18.645]  It's now all being announced.
[02:09:19.266 --> 02:09:22.369]  There's just huge amounts of news, so key, coming up.
[02:09:22.429 --> 02:09:28.394]  But here is Rob Dews' boil-down with our other reporters of a very serious trend.
[02:09:28.654 --> 02:09:30.355]  Vaccine death toll rises.
[02:09:30.695 --> 02:09:35.940]  The full video is posted on Infowars.com to send to your friends and family, especially if they have children.
[02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:39.803]  If adults want to kill themselves or get hurt really bad, that's their issue.
[02:09:39.823 --> 02:09:41.504]  Okay?
[02:09:41.544 --> 02:09:41.945]  Free will.
[02:09:42.665 --> 02:09:44.847]  You don't want to look at the medical info and just want to laugh at us?
[02:09:44.887 --> 02:09:45.287]  Go ahead.
[02:09:46.088 --> 02:09:46.969]  I know I'm right.
[02:09:48.228 --> 02:09:51.991]  I wouldn't tell you don't take these vaccines if I didn't think they had some good in them.
[02:09:52.372 --> 02:09:56.235]  Because I don't want the bad karma mojo, reap what you sow and give them bad advice.
[02:09:56.996 --> 02:09:58.577]  My kids don't have them, I don't take them.
[02:09:59.198 --> 02:09:59.938]  I know what's in them.
[02:10:00.619 --> 02:10:02.441]  And I know it's an organized plan.
[02:10:02.981 --> 02:10:06.304]  It's not that inoculations isn't a real science and couldn't do some good.
[02:10:07.745 --> 02:10:12.610]  This is the same New World Order that's been caught all over the planet adding syphilis to shots.
[02:10:14.690 --> 02:10:16.053]  You gonna take those shots, folks?
[02:10:16.133 --> 02:10:18.038]  These people want to kill you and your family.
[02:10:18.819 --> 02:10:21.886]  Now the average doctor or nurse is dumber than a box of rocks compartmentalized.
[02:10:22.605 --> 02:10:23.586]  But a lot of them aren't taking them.
[02:10:24.006 --> 02:10:24.807]  Let's go to this report.
[02:10:25.508 --> 02:10:28.910]  This is Rob Dew, reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:10:29.291 --> 02:10:35.016]  And this report is an update on two reports that I've filed this month, basically, and the one I actually filed just over the weekend.
[02:10:35.536 --> 02:10:39.079]  The first one is about the little girl who died of the flu after taking the flu shot.
[02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:44.224]  Well, now there's another little girl that died, in addition to the numerous other cases that are out there.
[02:10:44.624 --> 02:10:47.366]  Somebody sent me this this morning and said, you have to look at this one.
[02:10:47.406 --> 02:10:49.929]  Here's the headline from the Daily Mail.
[02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:56.533]  Girl 5 dies from strain of flu she was vaccinated against as deadly epidemic continues to sweep across the U.S.
[02:10:57.193 --> 02:10:58.614]  And this is something we're seeing everywhere.
[02:10:59.034 --> 02:11:04.558]  And the CDC comes out with this song and dance that I'm about to show you, where they say, well, we guessed the wrong strain of flu.
[02:11:04.818 --> 02:11:06.019]  They didn't guess anything wrong.
[02:11:06.339 --> 02:11:09.120]  They're deliberately putting this stuff in there so people get the flu.
[02:11:09.621 --> 02:11:11.282]  But we'll get more into that in a second.
[02:11:11.502 --> 02:11:19.147]  A 5-year-old girl has died in hospital three days after developing a strain of flu that she was vaccinated against as the deadly outbreak of the virus continues to sweep across the country.
[02:11:19.813 --> 02:11:23.256]  And once again, this article is filled with pictures of this beautiful little girl.
[02:11:23.517 --> 02:11:24.517]  She loved Frozen.
[02:11:24.558 --> 02:11:25.639]  She loved playing with her friends.
[02:11:25.659 --> 02:11:26.539]  She liked the color purple.
[02:11:26.559 --> 02:11:36.569]  They always put this stuff in there, and it really just tears at my heart reading these stories of parents who are trying to protect their kids from flu, and they think they're doing the right thing by getting the vaccine.
[02:11:37.029 --> 02:11:37.390]  Here's more.
[02:11:37.910 --> 02:11:45.337]  The youngster is the fourth child in the Nevada-based county and the 56th nationwide to have died in the flu in the past few months as vaccines have proved largely ineffective.
[02:11:45.638 --> 02:11:55.828]  Kara's death also comes after the CDC reported last week that more than three-quarters of people who had the injection, which contains strains of influenza A, this year will get the virus anyway.
[02:11:56.308 --> 02:11:57.329]  Even with all the hype about
[02:11:57.409 --> 02:12:00.732]  Getting your flu vaccine, how it's everywhere in the media, everywhere in the news.
[02:12:00.752 --> 02:12:03.254]  You go to every drugstore, they're trying to get you to do your flu shot.
[02:12:03.334 --> 02:12:07.818]  You have 7-Eleven promoting workers to get their flu-fee shots.
[02:12:08.818 --> 02:12:17.505]  It's the worst performing ever since they've been recording this 10 years, 10 years now, that we're into this flu vaccine hysteria and tracking the results.
[02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:19.551]  So are you going to get the flu shot?
[02:12:19.571 --> 02:12:20.551]  Are you going to give it to your kids?
[02:12:20.571 --> 02:12:22.072]  I'm going to share with you a little story.
[02:12:22.492 --> 02:12:23.953]  This happened just this past weekend.
[02:12:24.613 --> 02:12:26.614]  Playing football out on the street with a bunch of my neighbors.
[02:12:27.434 --> 02:12:32.877]  And earlier, it was a week before that, my kids weren't allowed to play with their kids because they all had the flu.
[02:12:33.237 --> 02:12:34.017]  This one family.
[02:12:34.798 --> 02:12:38.519]  And in talking, they said, oh yeah, well we got all our flu shot injections and we still got it.
[02:12:38.539 --> 02:12:41.741]  And then another neighbor from across the street says,
[02:12:42.711 --> 02:12:47.013]  They all had their flu shots, and three out of the four got the flu.
[02:12:47.513 --> 02:12:49.054]  And now let's turn to the measles outbreak.
[02:12:49.114 --> 02:12:55.497]  I just put out a report over the weekend, Disneyland measles outbreak caused by the vaccine, question mark.
[02:12:56.218 --> 02:13:02.521]  And I went through the statistics and the LA Times article saying that five people had gotten it that were vaccinated.
[02:13:02.641 --> 02:13:08.524]  Two out of the five workers that were vaccinated got the disease, and that's only the ones that they tested.
[02:13:09.204 --> 02:13:10.165]  Well, now we got one more.
[02:13:10.885 --> 02:13:13.408]  Measles outbreak traced to Disneyland continues to grow.
[02:13:14.269 --> 02:13:17.031]  At least 85 cases are now confirmed in seven states.
[02:13:17.552 --> 02:13:23.038]  Alaska health officials are closely monitoring one-year-old Rivki Webb after she tested positive for measles this week.
[02:13:23.378 --> 02:13:26.721]  Her mother Emily said the family had just returned from a visit to Southern California.
[02:13:27.142 --> 02:13:29.885]  Rivki had also just received the measles vaccine.
[02:13:31.121 --> 02:13:44.304]  And then you get to the end of this CBS News article and you got a quote from the mother who says, I want people to be aware and to vaccinate their kids, said Emily Webb, because the whole reason that she got sick in the first place was because people don't vaccinate.
[02:13:45.184 --> 02:13:48.944]  Well, if you vaccinate your kid, then she should be protected from the virus, right?
[02:13:49.085 --> 02:13:51.985]  And isn't that the whole reason they tell you to get these and that they're safe and effective?
[02:13:52.485 --> 02:13:55.026]  Well, then your daughter gets it after she'd been vaccinated.
[02:13:55.346 --> 02:13:56.366]  And I read in the insert
[02:13:57.543 --> 02:14:01.116]  In three different spots, it says you could get measles or a measles-like rash.
[02:14:01.718 --> 02:14:03.746]  In the insert, as one of the side effects.
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:07.201]  People still continue to do it because they don't ask for these inserts.
[02:14:07.661 --> 02:14:08.201]  It's amazing.
[02:14:08.461 --> 02:14:09.142]  Totally amazing.
[02:14:09.562 --> 02:14:10.882]  But here's Wired Magazine.
[02:14:11.162 --> 02:14:13.603]  Why did vaccinated people get measles at Disneyland?
[02:14:13.943 --> 02:14:15.484]  Blame the unvaccinated.
[02:14:16.084 --> 02:14:19.205]  And this is medical arrogance at its finest right here.
[02:14:19.245 --> 02:14:24.267]  They claim because people aren't getting the vaccine that they're making the vaccinated people sick.
[02:14:24.667 --> 02:14:28.789]  Which just defies logic because supposedly if you're vaccinated you're protected from the disease.
[02:14:29.369 --> 02:14:31.970]  But that's not the case, and we find that time and time again.
[02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:39.413]  And it's hard to find these, and that's why we really make a big deal out of it when we do see it, when we see people admitted that, hey, they were vaccinated, but they still got the disease.
[02:14:39.694 --> 02:14:45.956]  We need to make note of this, because they tell you time and time again that you should inject these foreign substances into your bodies, and it's going to protect you.
[02:14:46.196 --> 02:14:51.339]  We have to keep these people honest, because the CDC, that's their job, is to get more people vaccinated.
[02:14:51.419 --> 02:14:52.299]  That's the program.
[02:14:52.599 --> 02:14:56.261]  Because most of these CDC heads are former Big Pharma employees.
[02:14:56.741 --> 02:14:57.522]  And this is the whole thing.
[02:14:57.562 --> 02:15:04.586]  When I interviewed Dr. Sherry Tinpenny years ago, went up to her office, and she said, you know, Rob, this is what I think it is.
[02:15:04.787 --> 02:15:11.411]  I think that the reason they push these vaccines, especially on these young kids, is so they become lifelong customers.
[02:15:12.071 --> 02:15:14.873]  Because they're going to see these other problems crop up.
[02:15:14.893 --> 02:15:22.038]  They may not have a serious adversary action, but they'll get something like allergies, or they'll get earaches, or they'll get tonsillitis.
[02:15:22.318 --> 02:15:25.681]  Something that keeps them coming back for more medical care.
[02:15:26.610 --> 02:15:33.353]  Over a hundred years ago, eugenicist social planners said that they'd use mind-altering drugs to control the population.
[02:15:34.874 --> 02:15:38.256]  By 2007, more than 20% of the U.S.
[02:15:38.296 --> 02:15:41.838]  population were on some type of prescription antidepressant.
[02:15:44.299 --> 02:15:55.745]  But in the case of foster children, a sector where the state has total control, at least two-thirds are forced to take a cocktail made up of, on average, seven psychotropic drugs.
[02:15:57.751 --> 02:16:18.362]  Chairman of the Texas Society of Psychiatric Physicians, Joe Burkett, testified before the Statehouse Select Committee hearing on psychotropic drugs in foster care and shocked the public when he said that two-thirds of foster children in Texas had been placed on psychiatric drugs because they were very, very sick from a bad gene pool.
[02:16:18.382 --> 02:16:21.924]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[02:16:22.745 --> 02:16:25.226]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[02:16:26.287 --> 02:16:29.830]  Besides the gene pools, they've then been traumatized by abuse, neglect, and problems.
[02:16:29.910 --> 02:16:33.213]  And then they've been traumatized by separation and all those things predisposed to mental illness.
[02:16:33.733 --> 02:16:46.403]  One thing that I really like and I'm amazed by when I put out these vaccine reports is the number of people that get on the message board and actually add other clues and links to things that other people can read.
[02:16:46.983 --> 02:16:48.725]  Because I don't have time to put it all on one report.
[02:16:48.765 --> 02:16:50.246]  There's just not enough time in the day.
[02:16:50.546 --> 02:16:52.608]  So I really do appreciate when people put their links down there.
[02:16:52.648 --> 02:16:53.428]  And let's have a debate.
[02:16:53.529 --> 02:16:54.810]  I'm all for an open, honest debate.
[02:16:55.430 --> 02:17:01.655]  You know, a lot of people sent this Penn & Teller thing, where they had them throwing bowling balls at little targets made up of children.
[02:17:02.275 --> 02:17:08.259]  And the ones that were vaccinated were protected from the bowling balls, and the other ones weren't, so they were getting mowed down.
[02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:16.005]  And a lot of the statistics that they're reporting, yeah, all these diseases were coming down, but they were coming down before the vaccines were ever introduced.
[02:17:16.365 --> 02:17:21.750]  They never show the beginning of these graphs, like when you see polio coming down to here and then the vaccine's introduced and it drops down to here.
[02:17:21.770 --> 02:17:23.372]  It was already on its way out.
[02:17:23.772 --> 02:17:31.740]  That's because of modern hygiene techniques, modern plumbing, people not sleeping in their clothes over and over again, days on end.
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:35.923]  It's a whole lot of things that caused these diseases to go down.
[02:17:36.324 --> 02:17:39.086]  So let's end here with this one article from VAC Truth that
[02:17:39.947 --> 02:17:43.831]  I encourage you to go and look at the other source articles that they put in here because it's amazing.
[02:17:44.152 --> 02:17:50.258]  Studies prove without a doubt that unvaccinated children are far healthier than their vaccinated peers.
[02:17:50.278 --> 02:17:55.964]  A 1992 immunization awareness study, IAS, conducted a survey to examine the health of New Zealand's children.
[02:17:56.404 --> 02:18:01.649]  Unsurprisingly, the results of their study indicate that unvaccinated children were far healthier than vaccinated children.
[02:18:02.350 --> 02:18:07.916]  So they interviewed about 245 families, nearly 500 children participated in this survey.
[02:18:08.297 --> 02:18:09.038]  Here's what they found.
[02:18:09.859 --> 02:18:20.310]  92% of the children requiring tonsillectomy operation had received the measles vaccination, indicating that vaccination for measles may have made some of the children susceptible to tonsillitis.
[02:18:20.851 --> 02:18:25.254]  But then it goes into another study that was even more in-depth back in 2011 in Germany.
[02:18:25.734 --> 02:18:33.779]  In September 2011, German researchers carried out a long-range study, surveyed a total of 8,000 unvaccinated children from the ages of 0 to 19.
[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:41.905]  So the kids that were vaccinated, 4.7% suffered from asthma, 10.7% suffered from hay fever, 13.2% suffered from neurodermatitis.
[02:18:42.265 --> 02:18:45.627]  With the unvaccinated children, you had asthma at 2.5%, hay fever at 3%, and neurodermatitis at 7%.
[02:18:49.109 --> 02:18:52.130]  Nearly half compared to the vaccinated children.
[02:18:53.310 --> 02:18:56.571]  And these aren't big health conditions, but these are things that determine quality of life.
[02:18:57.572 --> 02:19:04.794]  I wonder if the CDC has conducted or facilitated a study comparing vaccinated children with unvaccinated children yet.
[02:19:05.014 --> 02:19:05.534]  Have you done that?
[02:19:06.940 --> 02:19:10.242]  We have not studied vaccinated versus unvaccinated.
[02:19:11.402 --> 02:19:11.782]  Never mind.
[02:19:11.802 --> 02:19:12.543]  Just stop there.
[02:19:12.603 --> 02:19:13.963]  That was the meaning of my question.
[02:19:13.983 --> 02:19:15.944]  You wasted two minutes of my time.
[02:19:15.964 --> 02:19:16.505]  Now look at this.
[02:19:17.005 --> 02:19:20.526]  Other conditions found to be almost non-existent in unvaccinated children.
[02:19:21.047 --> 02:19:22.067]  With dyslexia, it was 0.21%.
[02:19:24.028 --> 02:19:26.250]  Speech delay or articulation problems, 0.38%.
[02:19:26.310 --> 02:19:27.211]  Sensory processing disorder, 0.28%.
[02:19:27.812 --> 02:19:27.972]  Anxiety, 0.25%.
[02:19:28.012 --> 02:19:28.692]  Depression, 0.12%.
[02:19:28.732 --> 02:19:29.093]  Bedwetting, 0.12%.
[02:19:29.153 --> 02:19:29.773]  Celiac disease, 0.12%.
[02:19:29.833 --> 02:19:30.434]  Gluten sensitivity, 0.41%.
[02:19:30.774 --> 02:19:31.295]  And GERD, 0.06%.
[02:19:44.907 --> 02:19:45.808]  I want to leave you with this.
[02:19:45.868 --> 02:19:48.009]  This last from the CDC.
[02:19:48.049 --> 02:19:54.072]  This is on their own website, and this is talking about identified prevalence of autism spectrum disorder.
[02:19:54.613 --> 02:19:58.055]  In 2000 in the United States, we were 1 in 150.
[02:19:58.095 --> 02:20:03.818]  And now in 2010, one hour, five years later, so I bet it's even worse, it was 1 in 68.
[02:20:04.318 --> 02:20:06.480]  Let's stop right there.
[02:20:06.780 --> 02:20:09.401]  The full report is on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:20:09.441 --> 02:20:10.422]  Get it out and warn people.
[02:20:10.702 --> 02:20:12.083]  Hey, sorry I'm running late.
[02:20:12.183 --> 02:20:13.984]  I had to stop and get my vitamins for the month.
[02:20:14.324 --> 02:20:19.048]  I got mine in the mail yesterday from DiscountNutritionShop.com, so I'm here totally on time.

[02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:13.050]  Stay tuned for more information.
[02:21:13.331 --> 02:21:15.692]  Are you worried about Big Brother watching your bank account?
[02:21:15.952 --> 02:21:17.412]  Frustrated with annoying fees?
[02:21:17.753 --> 02:21:20.174]  Concerned about unauthorized access to your account?
[02:21:20.494 --> 02:21:22.475]  What if there was a way to be your own bank?
[02:21:22.955 --> 02:21:25.896]  Bitcoin gives you a way to take back control of your money.
[02:21:26.136 --> 02:21:30.318]  The citizens of two large countries have already turned to Bitcoin when their economies collapsed.
[02:21:30.719 --> 02:21:33.600]  Unlike US dollars, there is a limited number of Bitcoins.
[02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:35.901]  The government cannot simply decide to print more.
[02:21:36.421 --> 02:21:41.486]  8 million people are already using Bitcoin anonymously with 90,000 retailers accepting them.
[02:21:41.747 --> 02:21:46.652]  Investors have put $4 billion into Bitcoin with millions more being invested daily.
[02:21:46.912 --> 02:21:51.657]  BitRush.com is based in Texas and provides the most profitable way to own Bitcoins.
[02:21:51.897 --> 02:21:56.662]  To receive your own free bitcoins, you can visit us at www.bitrush.com.
[02:21:56.902 --> 02:21:59.485]  That's B-I-T-R-U-S-H dot com.
[02:21:59.665 --> 02:22:00.406]  Or call us at 1-800-200-8202.
[02:22:00.426 --> 02:22:02.107]  Again, that's bitrush.com or 1-800-200-8202 for free bitcoins.
[02:22:10.115 --> 02:22:16.317]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[02:22:16.878 --> 02:22:20.639]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[02:22:21.259 --> 02:22:24.220]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[02:22:24.761 --> 02:22:25.361]  Not fun!
[02:22:25.901 --> 02:22:33.704]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[02:22:34.304 --> 02:22:39.066]  One World Way is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[02:22:39.386 --> 02:22:40.206]  My name is Errol.
[02:22:40.546 --> 02:22:41.886]  I'm 74 years old.
[02:22:42.086 --> 02:22:44.487]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[02:22:44.667 --> 02:22:52.128]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your Trace Mineral Supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[02:22:52.508 --> 02:22:58.569]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[02:22:58.809 --> 02:22:59.250]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:22:59.310 --> 02:22:59.490]  That's 888-988-3325.

[02:23:59.107 --> 02:23:59.327]  844-2GUNS80.
[02:24:16.169 --> 02:24:37.095]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
[02:24:39.642 --> 02:24:42.084]  The bastards hung me in the spring of 25.
[02:24:42.684 --> 02:24:44.625]  But I am still alive.
[02:24:45.066 --> 02:24:46.927]  But I am still alive.
[02:24:47.627 --> 02:24:50.409]  Here comes Kris Kristofferson.
[02:24:50.809 --> 02:24:51.890]  I was a sailor.
[02:24:51.910 --> 02:24:55.512]  After Zuckerberg said we are all Charlie.
[02:24:58.740 --> 02:25:00.442]  Facebook censors Bahamut images.
[02:25:01.362 --> 02:25:04.846]  I noticed that that's a Breitbart article that's up on drugreport.com.
[02:25:05.346 --> 02:25:07.708]  Kurt Demme had one also out this morning.
[02:25:08.289 --> 02:25:09.710]  Same thing at Infowars.com.
[02:25:10.170 --> 02:25:12.332]  Facebook blocks images of Bahamut.
[02:25:13.573 --> 02:25:16.376]  Social media giant buckles the pressure from Turkish government.
[02:25:17.506 --> 02:25:26.188]  And that's a good article by Nemo, but we probably want to add to this that Zuckerberg, you know, claims he's for free speech, but he also calls his users dumb effers for trusting him.
[02:25:26.528 --> 02:25:28.089]  You dumb effers, you trust me?
[02:25:29.329 --> 02:25:30.189]  With your info.
[02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:37.631]  See, they enjoy, like, Gruber laughing at their prisoners.
[02:25:38.271 --> 02:25:41.412]  See, hardcore criminals, most of them don't do it to survive.
[02:25:41.432 --> 02:25:44.693]  If some starving family gets caught breaking into a store to get food,
[02:25:46.087 --> 02:25:47.548]  How are you going to even charge them with something?
[02:25:47.568 --> 02:25:49.169]  They're starving in some terrible country.
[02:25:50.610 --> 02:25:56.195]  But the big crimes... Why does a bank robber sometimes just shoot the clerk when they leave?
[02:25:56.255 --> 02:26:00.037]  Or shoot a liquor store clerk after they've given you the cash?
[02:26:00.718 --> 02:26:01.398]  Because they're scum!
[02:26:03.060 --> 02:26:09.404]  Well, the successful criminals, their modus operandi, their mindset, their profile is basically the same.
[02:26:10.045 --> 02:26:11.326]  They don't enjoy being honorable.
[02:26:11.366 --> 02:26:12.607]  They enjoy cheating people.
[02:26:13.772 --> 02:26:18.138]  And that's the type of folks you see at Davos and at Bilderberg that this twit's been to both of them.
[02:26:18.979 --> 02:26:21.523]  With his little Harvard front company, he's a total front.
[02:26:22.004 --> 02:26:24.547]  I mean, Facebook's admittedly CIA, just like Google.
[02:26:25.028 --> 02:26:27.772]  It is truly disgusting with its pump and dump and the rest of it.
[02:26:28.172 --> 02:26:29.013]  Now let's continue.
[02:26:30.111 --> 02:26:31.252]  Because this ties into that.
[02:26:32.192 --> 02:26:32.592]  U.S.
[02:26:32.712 --> 02:26:40.597]  watchdog urges safeguards for Internet of Things and says that, oh my gosh, all these chips built into everything means it can be hacked and taken over.
[02:26:40.617 --> 02:26:44.579]  Yeah, because it's meant to be taken over by the smart meters and government hubs and Google cars.
[02:26:45.019 --> 02:26:50.082]  Oh, so now they need more surveillance to stop people getting into all your systems.
[02:26:52.403 --> 02:26:54.164]  Meanwhile, that ties into this.
[02:26:54.464 --> 02:26:54.744]  U.K.
[02:26:54.784 --> 02:26:57.005]  government announces plan to remotely control vehicles.
[02:26:57.045 --> 02:26:57.806]  Remember that story yesterday?
[02:26:59.917 --> 02:27:05.380]  And I actually went yesterday and again today, because even I can't believe how bold they are moving this quick.
[02:27:06.621 --> 02:27:09.022]  In this article, UK government announced this plan.
[02:27:09.462 --> 02:27:11.103]  You go to the government website.
[02:27:11.123 --> 02:27:12.563]  People say, what's your source on this?
[02:27:12.584 --> 02:27:15.425]  In fact, in the comments, they're like, come on, I want to see a source.
[02:27:15.465 --> 02:27:17.406]  This is, this is unbelievable.
[02:27:17.486 --> 02:27:19.047]  I mean, what does he mean they're going to?
[02:27:20.868 --> 02:27:27.191]  They're putting up antennas all over England, same thing's going in here, same global plan, to quote, reduce greenhouse gases.
[02:27:28.578 --> 02:27:39.481]  Where during peak emission times or traffic, the cars will be taken over and wirelessly speed engine, all of it will be controlled.
[02:27:39.501 --> 02:27:41.102]  Can you imagine how dangerous this is?
[02:27:42.022 --> 02:27:46.524]  Talk about robot cars, Google take it over, they're going to turn your car into a robot car, let me stop you.
[02:27:48.464 --> 02:27:51.005]  Do you think they just magically hack into systems?
[02:27:51.585 --> 02:27:53.286]  You're paying in the price of the car.
[02:27:54.824 --> 02:27:56.085]  I saw one estimate as much as $10,000.
[02:27:56.205 --> 02:28:00.449]  Because the more luxurious, the more of this there is.
[02:28:00.989 --> 02:28:03.491]  Inexpensive cars, as much as $5,000 in the cost.
[02:28:04.352 --> 02:28:06.214]  Be nice to a lower car about $5,000, wouldn't it?
[02:28:07.355 --> 02:28:08.616]  Is all the spy tech.
[02:28:10.353 --> 02:28:12.234]  This is from the government website in the UK.
[02:28:12.794 --> 02:28:17.257]  M2M sensors in cars and on roads monitor the build-up of congestion.
[02:28:17.277 --> 02:28:19.838]  It's just magically, this has been put in all the cars worldwide now.
[02:28:20.199 --> 02:28:21.559]  It's all a big accident.
[02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:22.780]  There's no conspiracy.
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:23.961]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[02:28:23.981 --> 02:28:24.321]  It's here.
[02:28:24.341 --> 02:28:24.841]  See, folks?
[02:28:25.061 --> 02:28:25.522]  Told you!
[02:28:25.702 --> 02:28:26.762]  Told you 15 years ago.
[02:28:26.782 --> 02:28:28.363]  I keep saying 15 years ago.
[02:28:28.383 --> 02:28:29.944]  Actually, I was talking about this by 97.
[02:28:30.064 --> 02:28:32.065]  So, told you 18 years ago.
[02:28:34.165 --> 02:28:38.306]  M2M sensors in cars, because it was on MIT Magazine, and I didn't just make it up.
[02:28:38.506 --> 02:28:41.067]  See, it wasn't that I broke something big.
[02:28:41.107 --> 02:28:50.570]  This whole nightmare plan from cancer viruses and the vaccines to kill you and your family are public.
[02:28:53.131 --> 02:28:53.792]  And we were winning.
[02:28:53.852 --> 02:28:56.372]  Vaccination was going way down until about five years ago.
[02:28:56.432 --> 02:29:00.894]  They redoubled their funding, more than doubled the funding in brainwashing, and now it's at all-time highs.
[02:29:02.210 --> 02:29:03.614]  The public just doesn't like to be bullied.
[02:29:03.635 --> 02:29:04.517]  They just submit to it.
[02:29:06.261 --> 02:29:17.866]  M2M sensors in cars on roads monitor the build-up of congestion and wirelessly send this information to the traffic control system, which automatically impose variable speed limits that smooth the flow of traffic, states OFCOM.
[02:29:18.227 --> 02:29:20.348]  This system can also communicate directly with cars.
[02:29:21.388 --> 02:29:21.488]  Ah!
[02:29:21.948 --> 02:29:29.452]  Directing them along diverted routes, which will surveil you, didn't follow your order, to avoid the congestion, even managing their speed.
[02:29:29.832 --> 02:29:30.852]  Did you hear that?
[02:29:30.872 --> 02:29:33.774]  Because you read deeper, it's going to control your speed.
[02:29:34.595 --> 02:29:35.861]  A remote governor?
[02:29:37.373 --> 02:29:42.956]  M2M sensors could also be attached to the mechanical parts of your car, such as ABS wheel rotation.
[02:29:43.696 --> 02:29:44.916]  Sensors to measure speed.
[02:29:45.237 --> 02:29:52.460]  This information can be wirelessly communicated to nearby cars, which onboard computers that process and react to this information.
[02:29:52.980 --> 02:29:54.421]  So, all the cars connected together.
[02:29:55.721 --> 02:29:56.882]  And Nissan's coming out.
[02:29:56.902 --> 02:29:59.263]  I told you, Japan's leading the way, along with the Germans.
[02:29:59.703 --> 02:29:59.983]  It's sick.
[02:30:00.003 --> 02:30:00.803]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.843 --> 02:30:01.564]  News Blitz coming up.
[02:30:01.624 --> 02:30:02.524]  Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.544 --> 02:30:02.944]  News Blitz!
[02:30:02.964 --> 02:30:03.585]  News Blitz!
[02:30:03.605 --> 02:30:04.145]  News Blitz!
[02:30:04.265 --> 02:30:06.566]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:11.147 --> 02:30:14.149]  Year after year, we watched the threats steadily increase.
[02:30:14.449 --> 02:30:19.793]  And now, this winter has been the worst on record when it comes to our immune systems and health.
[02:30:20.073 --> 02:30:29.179]  For more than two years, InfoWarsLife.com has been watching this crisis intensify, and Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Complex was our answer.
[02:30:29.499 --> 02:30:41.027]  Using a proprietary process that takes ancient, proven herbs and combines them with modern science, this powerful and affordable formula contains more than 14 key herbs and extracts, including
[02:30:41.067 --> 02:30:42.088]  We're good to go.
[02:31:10.885 --> 02:31:19.551]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[02:31:19.872 --> 02:31:29.859]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[02:31:30.399 --> 02:31:36.524]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:31:36.844 --> 02:31:42.989]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:31:43.249 --> 02:31:45.911]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[02:31:46.291 --> 02:31:47.011]  We're good to go.
[02:32:10.939 --> 02:32:14.442]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:32:14.582 --> 02:32:18.545]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:18.865 --> 02:32:20.327]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:20.647 --> 02:32:28.233]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:32:28.513 --> 02:32:29.354]  But for how long?
[02:32:29.654 --> 02:32:35.919]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:32:36.299 --> 02:32:39.102]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:32:40.475 --> 02:32:43.697]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:43.997 --> 02:32:52.002]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:52.242 --> 02:32:57.266]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:32:57.646 --> 02:32:59.947]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:33:00.187 --> 02:33:01.969]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:33:11.229 --> 02:33:16.283]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:33:30.663 --> 02:33:34.524]  Last night a little dancer came dancing to my door.
[02:33:34.544 --> 02:33:38.506]  Last night a little dancer came dancing to my door.
[02:33:38.606 --> 02:33:42.107]  I know it's mindless pop rock, but I love it.
[02:33:42.247 --> 02:33:43.627]  Billy Arnold's gonna be playing in Denver.
[02:33:43.687 --> 02:33:46.008]  I saw Billy Arnold when I was about 12 years old in Dallas.
[02:33:46.028 --> 02:33:49.929]  He tended to go up there and sing, but I don't usually travel for stuff like that.
[02:33:49.969 --> 02:33:51.090]  But you know what?
[02:33:51.190 --> 02:33:53.350]  All work and no play makes Jack crazy.
[02:33:54.171 --> 02:33:54.731]  Crank it up!
[02:33:56.408 --> 02:34:02.391]  This is a key part of the song right here.
[02:34:29.007 --> 02:34:33.309]  She doesn't like slavery?
[02:34:33.449 --> 02:34:36.171]  Oh yeah.
[02:34:37.971 --> 02:34:40.072]  What sets you free?
[02:34:40.192 --> 02:34:45.215]  I need to hear about me!
[02:34:45.255 --> 02:34:54.299]  Part of the reason I act goofy on air is so people don't take me too seriously and so you don't take yourself too seriously.
[02:34:56.013 --> 02:35:04.397]  We all need to be able to make a joke about ourselves from time to time, but we should take serious people trying to enslave us, people trying to make us their... their chattel.
[02:35:05.378 --> 02:35:19.105]  Because there's only one thing worse than somebody that takes themselves too seriously, is some control freak narcissist that wants to run our lives, and thinks they're better than us, and gets together in a big nasty gang of scum to come try to dominate us.
[02:35:20.585 --> 02:35:23.847]  And if you don't have an instinct to want to resist that, something's wrong with you!
[02:35:27.671 --> 02:35:30.353]  A bunch of this I've covered, most of it I haven't.
[02:35:31.574 --> 02:35:32.694]  We're going to attempt it one more time.
[02:35:32.734 --> 02:35:34.696]  I've never succeeded since I was first on Talk Radio.
[02:35:35.016 --> 02:35:43.181]  First few years on Talk Radio, I think I was almost better than I am now, because I would get a huge stack of news, stack it this way, not all spread out, and then I would just go through it.
[02:35:43.802 --> 02:35:45.262]  I would run through it, ranting.
[02:35:45.983 --> 02:35:51.907]  It would take two hours, and the ratings poured in, people loved it, and I just can't seem to do it.
[02:35:53.558 --> 02:35:55.201]  Because I want to elaborate on each thing.
[02:35:55.942 --> 02:36:03.736]  Like this stack over here, like a dog returning to its vomit, I want to go back into the Internet of Things stack because it's so important, but I've already covered it.
[02:36:05.359 --> 02:36:15.044]  I mean, look, the feds are a watchdog, they want to save us, but meanwhile they're coming out all over the world with remote control cars, the government watches everything you do and taxes the daylights out of you, and magically the tracker hubs detects you're already in all the cars.
[02:36:15.264 --> 02:36:16.485]  I mean, my gosh, that's over the top.
[02:36:17.045 --> 02:36:19.366]  Here's another one, InfoWars.com, Daniel Taylor.
[02:36:19.386 --> 02:36:24.789]  NSA cyber war will use Internet of Things as weapons platform, your home is the battlefield.
[02:36:24.809 --> 02:36:28.391]  It has them announcing it in the article.
[02:36:29.682 --> 02:36:36.591]  Uh, and we got Marshall McLuhan saying World War III is a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation.
[02:36:38.393 --> 02:36:40.816]  And that's in culture is our business, Marshall McLuhan.
[02:36:41.690 --> 02:36:42.530]  And boy was he right.
[02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:50.453]  That's why Vic Vreeland, the former Air Force Intelligence Officer and Deputy Fire Chief of Austin, came up with the idea for Infowars.com.
[02:36:50.493 --> 02:36:52.574]  And by the way, I keep forgetting, I'm sure Vic's still alive.
[02:36:52.834 --> 02:36:53.274]  I looked it up.
[02:36:53.814 --> 02:36:57.336]  I know he and his wife, I know his parrot, Petey, until he died.
[02:36:57.656 --> 02:36:59.436]  When he retired, he moved to Bastrop.
[02:36:59.937 --> 02:37:01.437]  Get me Vic Vreeland.
[02:37:01.697 --> 02:37:03.338]  Pay for a limo to take him in here.
[02:37:03.638 --> 02:37:08.682]  I remember like 10 years ago, I tried to get Vic Vreeland on air and he goes, I don't need to Alex.
[02:37:09.122 --> 02:37:10.423]  They don't want to be free.
[02:37:10.443 --> 02:37:11.444]  I'm just going to retire.
[02:37:11.524 --> 02:37:12.025]  I'm retired.
[02:37:12.065 --> 02:37:12.625]  I enjoy myself.
[02:37:15.087 --> 02:37:16.308]  He said, I tried, I tried.
[02:37:16.648 --> 02:37:18.410]  He didn't talk radio for a long time.
[02:37:18.450 --> 02:37:22.633]  He used to fill in for Tom Valentine, who had a huge syndicated show.
[02:37:23.454 --> 02:37:27.477]  I want Vic Vreeland in here and I want him now.
[02:37:28.398 --> 02:37:30.840]  And I will punish you with bigger bonuses if you get him.
[02:37:31.641 --> 02:37:35.183]  Anyways, there's really only carrots around this office.
[02:37:35.864 --> 02:37:37.705]  I spoil everybody, but I have a great crew.
[02:37:38.225 --> 02:37:38.966]  All right, let's continue.
[02:37:38.986 --> 02:37:42.248]  Well, there is, I do flip out occasionally, so actually there are some sticks around here.
[02:37:43.709 --> 02:37:46.211]  NSA cyber war, so there's that article.
[02:37:48.172 --> 02:37:48.472]  U.S.
[02:37:48.512 --> 02:37:56.597]  signs $2 billion loan agreement with Ukraine, offers to increase pressure on Russia.
[02:37:56.918 --> 02:38:00.380]  It was Vic Vreeland came up with the, because there's a war on for your mind thing too.
[02:38:02.236 --> 02:38:05.680]  No, I'm not a plagiarist, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:12.928]  I revel in giving people the credit they're due because I love humanity and I get off on collaboration with good people.
[02:38:13.969 --> 02:38:14.489]  I just love it.
[02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:18.394]  That's why I used to always try to work with all these talk show hosts and build up other people and stuff.
[02:38:20.856 --> 02:38:26.659]  I learned very quickly that a lot of people out there take that as weakness, and then try to destroy you when you try to help them.
[02:38:26.719 --> 02:38:34.563]  But, if you transcend that and just keep helping people, you'll find who the good folks are, and it's that process that's part of life already.
[02:38:35.864 --> 02:38:37.125]  Sorry, I'm pontificating.
[02:38:38.285 --> 02:38:38.645]  U.S.
[02:38:38.705 --> 02:38:46.249]  signs $2 billion loan agreement with Ukraine, that'll all be siphoned into George Soros' and others' pockets, to increase pressure on Russia.
[02:38:46.549 --> 02:38:49.211]  We will continue to work with our allies to increase the pressure on Russia.
[02:38:50.305 --> 02:38:55.108]  Reuters isn't that nice to stir up all that trouble on Russia's doorstep.
[02:38:55.828 --> 02:38:58.090]  What do you like Vladimir Putin?
[02:38:59.310 --> 02:39:02.112]  Well, I don't like World War III and I don't like messing with people, I guess so.
[02:39:02.833 --> 02:39:08.556]  I guess if I don't want World War III, I'd secretly, secretly massage Putin's bunions.
[02:39:09.337 --> 02:39:12.819]  I already mentioned this, it's just insane, Zuckerberg.
[02:39:13.219 --> 02:39:14.199]  Let's move on from there.
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:15.941]  Let's move to this nice stack.
[02:39:16.821 --> 02:39:17.902]  We will cut your head
[02:39:20.689 --> 02:39:26.390]  We will cut off your head in the White House, ISIS threatens to behead Obama and turn the U.S.
[02:39:26.450 --> 02:39:29.851]  into a Muslim province in new execution video.
[02:39:30.571 --> 02:39:33.312]  Well, Obama's already trying to turn us into a radical Muslim province.
[02:39:33.632 --> 02:39:37.553]  This is pure red meat propaganda written by a Western intelligence agency.
[02:39:38.113 --> 02:39:42.634]  ISIS is Al-Qaeda, is being funded by Saudi Arabia, is being funded by NATO.
[02:39:42.674 --> 02:39:43.434]  It's all on record.
[02:39:43.734 --> 02:39:47.555]  And this is to give Obama cover to make him look good for Americans.
[02:39:49.206 --> 02:39:53.850]  It's like Hillary gets up and goes, I don't think we need open borders.
[02:39:54.250 --> 02:39:58.434]  She actually comes to Texas and goes, I'm here to tell you something, boy.
[02:39:58.454 --> 02:40:03.398]  I don't like open borders and I don't like gun control.
[02:40:03.918 --> 02:40:04.418]  I'm not kidding.
[02:40:04.478 --> 02:40:05.539]  I saw that on the news like a month ago.
[02:40:05.559 --> 02:40:06.480]  I meant to tell you guys to get it.
[02:40:06.740 --> 02:40:10.343]  We do have her in Kentucky going, I don't feel no ways tired.
[02:40:10.363 --> 02:40:11.324]  That's right.
[02:40:11.784 --> 02:40:12.825]  You are.
[02:40:14.166 --> 02:40:19.911]  From where I started from, nobody told me that the road would be easy.
[02:40:19.951 --> 02:40:20.711]  That's in Kentucky.
[02:40:20.752 --> 02:40:25.395]  I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me.
[02:40:25.435 --> 02:40:26.636]  Listen, I remember Rick Perry did this.
[02:40:26.676 --> 02:40:31.960]  We ought to find the clip because they even played it on 590 Megaphone a few years ago when he was running for president like two or three years ago.
[02:40:33.367 --> 02:40:40.552]  He went and spoke to, I think it was Lulac, it's Rick Perry, Lulac, or La Raza in L.A., and he goes, Hello!
[02:40:41.013 --> 02:40:44.975]  Good to be with you to talk to you.
[02:40:45.156 --> 02:40:46.356]  I mean, oh my.
[02:40:46.777 --> 02:40:51.600]  I've got relatives and stuff, you'll be in a Mexican food restaurant, and they'll come over and go, Hey, how you doing?
[02:40:51.620 --> 02:40:52.441]  What would you like to eat?
[02:40:54.412 --> 02:40:57.074]  I like taco, bean.
[02:40:57.094 --> 02:41:06.603]  I mean, I mean, this is this condescending thing that when these politicians are in the South, they go, how you doing, partner?
[02:41:06.643 --> 02:41:08.445]  I'm bringing beer with you.
[02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:14.963]  But then when they're talking to what they think is a Hispanic audience, like they can't understand the English, it's amazing.
[02:41:14.983 --> 02:41:18.286]  It's like if it was an audience that didn't speak English in Mexico, speak Spanish!
[02:41:19.086 --> 02:41:26.832]  Don't sit there and like make up some weird language where you... Oh my gosh, if you want to get politically correct, the one thing I see white people do...
[02:41:27.788 --> 02:41:30.449]  is, is, is, is do that and I cannot stand it.
[02:41:30.689 --> 02:41:34.171]  I'll start making fun of people in my family when they start doing it, if I'm in a restaurant.
[02:41:34.191 --> 02:41:38.412]  I go, that's, I go, and do you have, because I cannot stand it.
[02:41:38.432 --> 02:41:40.693]  You were talking about one of my pet peeves, that's it.
[02:41:40.973 --> 02:41:42.974]  When I'm in England, I talk like this.
[02:41:43.614 --> 02:41:45.675]  When I'm in New York, I talk, this is what I sound like.
[02:41:45.935 --> 02:41:47.396]  When I'm in LA, this is what I sound like.
[02:41:48.373 --> 02:41:53.557]  Now, you hang around folks enough, you'll start picking up their accent and stuff, but this just shows the pure manipulation.
[02:41:53.757 --> 02:41:56.659]  By the way, I don't know how you guys found Hillary doing that that fast.
[02:41:57.219 --> 02:42:00.301]  We did not plan that, where I was just making fun of her and you did that.
[02:42:02.143 --> 02:42:04.124]  So, I said I'd cover the news, and obviously I'm not.
[02:42:04.164 --> 02:42:04.664]  I'm ranting.
[02:42:05.545 --> 02:42:09.468]  We'll cut your head off in the White House!
[02:42:10.128 --> 02:42:14.911]  Well, actually, the leader of ISIS is in the White House, so Obama might decide to commit suicide by guillotine.
[02:42:14.952 --> 02:42:16.813]  He could pull the rope and trigger it and
[02:42:18.314 --> 02:42:18.994]  It may be true.
[02:42:19.094 --> 02:42:23.056]  It is possible that ISIS could chop off the President's head in the White House.
[02:42:23.797 --> 02:42:29.699]  And no, it won't be a drone with a remote-controlled guillotine with a cigar cutter flying at it.
[02:42:29.739 --> 02:42:41.545]  I don't know if you can get the big head, but... Like drones with... Maybe that's the new feminist law so men don't pee standing up as you go into the bathroom.
[02:42:41.565 --> 02:42:44.146]  They got a decapitation drone waiting in there.
[02:42:44.426 --> 02:42:46.107]  Drones don't have guillotines, just train cars.
[02:42:46.848 --> 02:42:47.308]  Exactly.
[02:42:48.325 --> 02:42:49.891]  Well, we're all drones now, aren't we?
[02:42:50.292 --> 02:42:51.316]  That's what our cars are.
[02:42:51.336 --> 02:42:53.022]  We're remote-controlled drone vehicles.
[02:42:54.249 --> 02:42:55.931]  So that's totally fake to make him look good.
[02:42:56.371 --> 02:43:09.463]  Michelle Obama navigates limits on women in Saudi Arabia AP and she quote refused to wear a hood over her head and so that's very shocking and Obama of course bowed to everyone as usual.
[02:43:10.804 --> 02:43:11.885]  He loves dictatorships.
[02:43:11.925 --> 02:43:12.946]  He wants to be a dictator.
[02:43:13.026 --> 02:43:14.127]  He is becoming a dictator.
[02:43:14.587 --> 02:43:16.749]  So he's kind of there learning from the guys that know how to do it.
[02:43:17.470 --> 02:43:19.211]  A bunch of corrupt freaks.
[02:43:20.700 --> 02:43:27.103]  Since I just look at Kim Jong-un, the Queen of England, any form of royalty, and it makes me want to just throw up.
[02:43:27.443 --> 02:43:29.604]  And that is what Kim Jong-un is, is a hereditary dictator.
[02:43:30.444 --> 02:43:35.186]  Meanwhile, again, Michelle Obama's face blurred by Saudi state television, although claim disputed.
[02:43:36.021 --> 02:43:36.501]  That's right.
[02:43:36.681 --> 02:43:41.823]  No one makes women wear hoods over their heads or puts them in prison if they drive cars in Saudi Arabia.
[02:43:41.863 --> 02:43:43.024]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[02:43:43.384 --> 02:43:47.926]  And China doesn't sell political dissidents' organs like the State Department under Clinton claimed.
[02:43:48.326 --> 02:43:52.728]  Even though it's admitted and they run ads advertising in English, we have, quote, fresh organs.
[02:43:53.248 --> 02:43:53.568]  Fresh!
[02:43:56.926 --> 02:43:59.547]  Davos Economist already spent a whole first hour on this.
[02:43:59.567 --> 02:44:01.068]  You need to listen to that in retransmission.
[02:44:02.248 --> 02:44:13.833]  The Davos Economist's warning of riots in the US and Europe if we don't give them $100 trillion at the Davos Group is George Soros' basically chief of staff and his warning of things that they're actually funding.
[02:44:14.733 --> 02:44:15.714]  You can't make that up.
[02:44:16.554 --> 02:44:17.154]  I shouldn't laugh.
[02:44:17.214 --> 02:44:17.795]  It's really sick.
[02:44:19.035 --> 02:44:19.595]  Oh my gosh!
[02:44:19.835 --> 02:44:23.337]  White House drone crash described as a US workers' drunken lark.
[02:44:24.096 --> 02:44:26.977]  Yes, it was 42 degrees and raining lightly about 3 a.m.
[02:44:27.017 --> 02:44:37.160]  on Monday when an inebriated off-duty employee for a government intelligence agency decided it was a good time to fly his friend's drone, a two-foot-by-two-foot quadrocopter.
[02:44:37.841 --> 02:44:44.543]  And if it is one of the primitive ones just a few years ago, or more primitive, they can get away from you when you get out of radio range and they just fall.
[02:44:45.383 --> 02:44:46.724]  It sells for hundreds of dollars.
[02:44:47.364 --> 02:44:49.665]  And so he was drunk and they're not going to charge him.
[02:44:50.025 --> 02:44:52.866]  You know, if you weren't a god man, a fed,
[02:44:53.906 --> 02:44:55.266]  Are you a god?
[02:44:55.286 --> 02:44:57.187]  Like they ask in Ghostbusters.
[02:44:57.587 --> 02:44:58.747]  He says, well, yes, I am a FED.
[02:44:58.767 --> 02:45:08.050]  They go, then you, your license plate will not be scanned, your vehicle will not be remote accessed or remote controlled, and you can crash drones on the lawn!
[02:45:08.830 --> 02:45:11.830]  But if you say, are you a god?
[02:45:11.850 --> 02:45:13.831]  And they say, no!
[02:45:13.851 --> 02:45:16.392]  Then die!
[02:45:18.112 --> 02:45:19.492]  Are you a producer?
[02:45:19.512 --> 02:45:21.953]  Again, if you haven't seen Ghostbusters, you don't know what I'm talking about.
[02:45:23.186 --> 02:45:24.667]  The LA looks like Hillary on there.
[02:45:29.749 --> 02:45:30.309]  Continuing.
[02:45:33.031 --> 02:45:37.393]  Obama approval rating at 50% as Republicans abandon immigration campaign promises.
[02:45:38.547 --> 02:45:51.822]  So he's gotten more popular with some of the liberals now and it's sending his approval rating up because they're going to gut the country entirely and offer everybody free goodies as the government builds armored bunkers and buys tanks and trains to take on the gun owners and have a huge civil war that George Soros is funding.
[02:45:52.042 --> 02:45:53.063]  What a wonderful idea!
[02:45:53.163 --> 02:45:53.684]  Why not?
[02:45:54.405 --> 02:45:54.885]  Why not?
[02:45:54.925 --> 02:45:56.327]  He's going to shut down more power plants.
[02:45:57.754 --> 02:46:00.778]  Border surge likely again in 2015, data shows.
[02:46:00.838 --> 02:46:05.264]  Out of the Daily Caller, the feds are predicting a new giant surge of illegals pouring across.
[02:46:05.284 --> 02:46:12.834]  There's another article here, Cuban refugees are flooding in at record levels because they think immigration rules may change if Cuba's normalized and they won't get all the free goodies.
[02:46:14.858 --> 02:46:16.239]  So that's some of the news in that stack.
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:20.823]  Trouble in GOP ranks kills votes on border and abortion bills.
[02:46:20.843 --> 02:46:23.285]  We saw all that traitorship last week.
[02:46:23.685 --> 02:46:25.246]  Traitorship, a new word I've invented.
[02:46:26.007 --> 02:46:29.269]  They are having degrees at college, full scholarship in traitorship.
[02:46:29.590 --> 02:46:39.858]  How to be a parasitic piece of filth that walks around going, liberal, oh, reasonable, don't be racist, let me run your life or you're a racist, two plus two equals five or you're not trendy, uh, uh, uh.
[02:46:40.178 --> 02:46:40.659]  I'm sorry.
[02:46:40.919 --> 02:46:41.980]  Let's continue here.
[02:46:42.880 --> 02:46:45.702]  Americans hate the federal government now more than ever.
[02:46:46.022 --> 02:46:46.983]  Market Watch article.
[02:46:47.944 --> 02:46:46.983]  73%.
[02:46:47.964 --> 02:46:51.226]  The other percentage are ones that are scared.
[02:46:55.109 --> 02:46:56.930]  I'm just going through the stacks here.
[02:47:00.472 --> 02:47:02.014]  Let's get to these other stacks now.
[02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:11.783]  The 19 ingredients in McDonald's fries, including a form of silicone found in Silly Putty, along with petrol-based chemicals.
[02:47:11.863 --> 02:47:17.885]  Well, I mean, who doesn't need petrol chemicals that have been in the ground for God knows how long and who knows what they're really made of?
[02:47:18.305 --> 02:47:19.466]  No, they can't really prove.
[02:47:19.506 --> 02:47:24.627]  There is a lot of oil that is based on dead life forms.
[02:47:25.868 --> 02:47:28.669]  But there's also a lot of, what do they call it, abiotic oil?
[02:47:29.804 --> 02:47:33.886]  There's also a lot of oil that they've proven that they don't, and the oil wells are replenishing.
[02:47:33.926 --> 02:47:35.226]  They don't know what's going on.
[02:47:36.767 --> 02:47:39.568]  And you notice the peak oil argument's gone now.
[02:47:40.128 --> 02:47:41.689]  There's so much oil we're drowning in it.
[02:47:44.210 --> 02:47:47.511]  Let's go over this New American article, which is very conservative.
[02:47:47.531 --> 02:47:51.533]  That's the John Birch Society, just like Chuck Norris exposing poison food and GMO.
[02:47:51.833 --> 02:47:53.233]  This is not just a liberal issue.
[02:47:53.573 --> 02:47:54.694]  This is an issue that's real.
[02:47:57.330 --> 02:48:02.316]  And McDonald's goes over all the wonderful things that are in their foods.
[02:48:03.217 --> 02:48:09.323]  Over 70 ingredients, just in the McRib alone, that they call food technology.
[02:48:10.244 --> 02:48:15.730]  And then it goes into all the delicious petrochemicals that, no, don't run your car's engine, but run you.
[02:48:16.775 --> 02:48:18.456]  And again, poisons are very addictive.
[02:48:18.496 --> 02:48:19.617]  That's the little secret.
[02:48:20.057 --> 02:48:28.302]  So when you ingest poisons in small amounts, your body then begins to metabolize them and learn to deal with them, and then wants them, if you're on it enough.
[02:48:31.563 --> 02:48:35.726]  Let's continue now, getting into the other news reports here that I have.
[02:48:37.403 --> 02:48:38.183]  This is very important.
[02:48:38.963 --> 02:48:39.324]  Poll.
[02:48:39.504 --> 02:48:43.164]  Large majority of Americans oppose Obama's immigration actions.
[02:48:43.905 --> 02:48:49.726]  A record number, 58% of registered voters are completely against it.
[02:48:49.746 --> 02:48:55.428]  You add them all together, it's basically up in the 70s the percentages that are against it, including a majority of Hispanics.
[02:48:57.308 --> 02:49:04.290]  Jordan agrees to prisoner swap with ISIS in deal that could free pilot and Japanese journalist.
[02:49:05.373 --> 02:49:09.136]  And these are just more excuses to give the CIA globalist force more weapons.
[02:49:11.198 --> 02:49:12.839]  But of course our borders are wide open.
[02:49:13.780 --> 02:49:22.407]  And again, don't forget though that they'll let ISIS and others recruit on Facebook, but you can't even post an image of Mohammed because Islamic law says even showing an image is bad.
[02:49:22.807 --> 02:49:28.071]  And so now in America you can't show that, but Infowars.com is censored pretty much constantly.
[02:49:28.792 --> 02:49:39.775]  Well, it's bigger than that.
[02:49:39.875 --> 02:49:53.780]  They are to be the domestic spy force, just as big and just as strong as our military that Obama talked about, and they're rolling out on the streets everywhere, and you will have to go through them to be able to get a special card to have a job even working at McDonald's.
[02:49:54.540 --> 02:49:57.321]  And you notice, people thought I was crazy 14 years ago when I talked about that.
[02:49:57.641 --> 02:49:58.261]  Now it's starting.
[02:50:00.029 --> 02:50:02.913]  They set these things up and then they expand them forever.
[02:50:05.957 --> 02:50:10.443]  Air passenger bank details to be handed to police under anti-terror plan.
[02:50:10.503 --> 02:50:10.724]  See?
[02:50:11.124 --> 02:50:13.467]  And that's out of the London Telegraph.
[02:50:14.997 --> 02:50:19.363]  Venezuela's Vice President is Head of Drug Cartel Claims Security Chief.
[02:50:19.964 --> 02:50:22.066]  Epoch Times, very powerful article.
[02:50:22.467 --> 02:50:32.961]  Yeah, in Latin America, it's not like where the CIA runs the drugs, but a consortium of banks launder it and make the money, and then subsidiaries make money off of it, and then the dummies, the dumb enough
[02:50:33.261 --> 02:50:36.942]  So the CIA and others have been a little better about hiding all the goodies.
[02:50:36.962 --> 02:50:38.483]  But now they don't so much hide it.
[02:50:38.503 --> 02:50:40.863]  They're kind of like, yeah, you're dumb effers, we run the drugs.
[02:50:40.883 --> 02:50:42.444]  Don't let us catch you with them or put you in prison.
[02:51:03.291 --> 02:51:05.253]  Put out more Hollywood movies where it's cool to use drugs.
[02:51:05.373 --> 02:51:06.654]  Get those scum using them.
[02:51:07.095 --> 02:51:09.217]  And you put poison in the vaccine right now.
[02:51:09.237 --> 02:51:10.318]  Murder them!
[02:51:10.338 --> 02:51:10.958]  Oh, we're so happy.
[02:51:10.998 --> 02:51:13.461]  Managing your business and customers isn't easy, huh?

[02:51:40.856 --> 02:51:41.436]  Hear that?
[02:51:42.077 --> 02:51:46.219]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[02:51:47.439 --> 02:51:49.721]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:51:50.221 --> 02:51:53.503]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[02:52:08.414 --> 02:52:09.635]  Faketv.com
[02:52:10.075 --> 02:52:11.796]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[02:52:12.016 --> 02:52:15.339]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[02:52:15.639 --> 02:52:16.619]  A pair of scissors.
[02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:22.503]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[02:52:22.783 --> 02:52:27.446]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[02:52:27.727 --> 02:52:28.527]  The phone line.
[02:52:28.687 --> 02:52:33.610]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[02:52:33.951 --> 02:52:37.693]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[02:52:37.853 --> 02:52:40.736]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[02:52:41.157 --> 02:52:43.399]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.

[02:53:09.520 --> 02:53:12.641]  I am a 47-year-old female and had a heart attack in 2005.
[02:53:12.901 --> 02:53:15.721]  This is Alice from New Jersey.
[02:53:16.221 --> 02:53:18.902]  I still get angina, even with four stints.
[02:53:19.402 --> 02:53:21.983]  I was taking nitro two or three times a week.
[02:53:22.323 --> 02:53:26.924]  The very first day after taking Heart and Body Extract, the chest pain was gone.
[02:53:27.344 --> 02:53:29.184]  Now I don't wear a nitro patch.

[02:53:40.743 --> 02:53:45.046]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[02:53:46.126 --> 02:53:48.388]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:53:48.888 --> 02:53:52.170]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[02:54:11.199 --> 02:54:14.962]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[02:54:32.560 --> 02:54:35.042]  Well, Mikkel Thelen just ran in here.
[02:54:36.542 --> 02:54:40.305]  Bill Gates gave an interview to a German publication while at the Davos event.
[02:54:40.325 --> 02:54:42.266]  That's why so much important stuff came out there.
[02:54:42.686 --> 02:54:46.949]  You know, give us a hundred trillion or we'll stir up the inner cities to burn everything down.
[02:54:47.269 --> 02:54:50.491]  That's the translation of the Soros ad that we'll cover in the retransmission.
[02:54:50.531 --> 02:54:51.471]  I cover it in the first hour.
[02:54:52.412 --> 02:54:57.655]  Well now, billionaire Bill Gates has called for a quote, a kind of a global government.
[02:54:59.002 --> 02:55:03.284]  Billionaire claims world government badly needed to save the earth.
[02:55:03.764 --> 02:55:08.986]  And one of our most efficient and focused investigative journalists, Mikael Thelen.
[02:55:09.046 --> 02:55:12.948]  I drug him in here just during the break when he brought me this article.
[02:55:13.368 --> 02:55:14.608]  He's going to be adding to the article.
[02:55:14.628 --> 02:55:15.509]  It's already a long article.
[02:55:15.529 --> 02:55:16.549]  He said it could be 30 pages.
[02:55:16.569 --> 02:55:17.870]  It's only about two pages now.
[02:55:17.910 --> 02:55:22.251]  But he's going to really add to this because this is such a big interview he did in Deutsch.
[02:55:22.792 --> 02:55:24.432]  I guess thinking we wouldn't translate it.
[02:55:24.452 --> 02:55:27.273]  Mikael, this story is on Infowars.com right now.
[02:55:27.313 --> 02:55:28.514]  Let's red link this baby.
[02:55:30.031 --> 02:55:36.355]  Yes, definitely interesting given all the things you brought up today about George Soros and all these calls, you know, for this kind of global system.
[02:55:36.375 --> 02:55:38.577]  And then we had Bill Gates coming out parroting the same thing.
[02:55:38.597 --> 02:55:42.320]  I mean, basically it translated, pay us a hundred trillion or we'll pay the black people to burn your city down.
[02:55:42.580 --> 02:55:42.960]  Exactly.
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:43.941]  I mean, then that's it.
[02:55:44.021 --> 02:55:45.562]  I mean, it's just horrible demon.
[02:55:45.962 --> 02:55:47.903]  Yeah, and so of course they're calling for carbon taxes.
[02:55:47.983 --> 02:55:53.466]  They want all this money to create this global system, which of course they claim will save the Earth when they're the very ones destroying it.
[02:55:54.226 --> 02:55:55.647]  And I bring up everything in the article.
[02:55:55.667 --> 02:56:00.949]  I bring up all the money Gates is investing in companies like McDonald's and major oil companies.
[02:56:01.089 --> 02:56:02.470]  And weather modification.
[02:56:02.550 --> 02:56:02.930]  Exactly.
[02:56:02.950 --> 02:56:03.670]  Geoengineering.
[02:56:03.990 --> 02:56:05.771]  He is a Dr. Evil.
[02:56:06.151 --> 02:56:09.233]  I mean, him and Soros and these guys are worse than James Bond villains.
[02:56:10.053 --> 02:56:12.894]  And then you realize Fleming based his villains on the real deal.
[02:56:13.575 --> 02:56:13.695]  Yeah.
[02:56:14.420 --> 02:56:16.463]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[02:56:17.424 --> 02:56:24.473]  Again, so the very people that are really destroying everything, our society, they're the ones that want the cashless society, as Kit Daniels wrote in his article about Bill Gates the other day.
[02:56:24.493 --> 02:56:29.399]  So it's really incredible that... So they can say, we're going to control the speed of your car.
[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:30.381]  Exactly.
[02:56:30.461 --> 02:56:32.564]  It's in your car, and we're going to take over.
[02:56:33.104 --> 02:56:35.007]  And your TV's watching you, so shut up!
[02:56:35.628 --> 02:56:36.409]  I mean, it's beyond 1984!
[02:56:36.969 --> 02:56:40.915]  So it really seems they're mopping everything up here with this Davos.
[02:56:40.955 --> 02:56:42.977]  They're really, really pushing this idea now.
[02:56:43.038 --> 02:56:47.464]  And as you said earlier with George Soros and his group all claiming that the elites are running and hiding, getting ready.
[02:56:48.084 --> 02:56:50.846]  It seems pretty apparent that they're moving things into the final stages.
[02:56:50.866 --> 02:56:56.450]  I'm telling you that they could release a bioweapon that kills a million people to bring in their world government.
[02:56:56.750 --> 02:56:59.432]  I mean, they've geared up, got everything set up for something big.
[02:56:59.472 --> 02:57:00.612]  Everything else has been beta tested.
[02:57:00.952 --> 02:57:03.214]  They could nuke five cities and say Patriots did it.
[02:57:03.554 --> 02:57:07.056]  I'm telling you folks, I get up here and joke around because I do this three hours.
[02:57:07.096 --> 02:57:07.757]  It's exhausting.
[02:57:07.817 --> 02:57:08.597]  It's gallows humor.
[02:57:09.338 --> 02:57:10.319]  This is not a joke.
[02:57:10.459 --> 02:57:13.541]  I mean, these people are just pure evil.
[02:57:14.426 --> 02:57:14.887]  Absolutely.
[02:57:15.047 --> 02:57:20.418]  So I'm not surprised that he's out saying this and with global warming hysteria at an all-time high as usual.
[02:57:21.304 --> 02:57:23.065]  Of course, they'll be pushing for the carbon taxes.
[02:57:23.825 --> 02:57:28.146]  Well, we need the police and military that are awake to really watch all this.
[02:57:28.166 --> 02:57:32.548]  We need citizens everywhere with human intelligence, with your cameras, your microphones.
[02:57:32.988 --> 02:57:34.288]  Get the data, get it out.
[02:57:34.348 --> 02:57:36.449]  Basically, start blogging everything.
[02:57:36.589 --> 02:57:37.789]  Use their system against them.
[02:57:38.110 --> 02:57:42.751]  They're trying to bring in management systems to manage the panopticon where it doesn't blow back on them.
[02:57:42.771 --> 02:57:43.491]  That's not going to work.
[02:57:44.151 --> 02:57:45.372]  We could actually bring them down.
[02:57:45.432 --> 02:57:46.952]  They've overreached.
[02:57:47.072 --> 02:57:48.573]  I'm not just saying this to be positive.
[02:57:49.366 --> 02:57:50.986]  We have a very good chance of beating them.
[02:57:51.126 --> 02:57:54.787]  They have a very low chance of winning, unless they blow the planet up.
[02:57:55.368 --> 02:57:56.548]  And they may see that as winning.
[02:57:56.588 --> 02:58:00.889]  In fact, in some of their writings, they say they have weapons that will blow the planet up, folks.
[02:58:00.909 --> 02:58:02.009]  They've got antimatter weapons.
[02:58:02.329 --> 02:58:05.090]  That was in Air Force documents released 12 years ago.
[02:58:05.630 --> 02:58:07.791]  And then in a speech, a colonel was asked about it.
[02:58:07.811 --> 02:58:09.471]  He said he can't speak about the weapons, but they have them.
[02:58:09.911 --> 02:58:10.991]  So that's why they're on power trips.
[02:58:11.031 --> 02:58:12.472]  Well, the ability to blow up the planet
[02:58:13.152 --> 02:58:16.634]  And it would look just like in the Star Trek where the planet sucks all in and implodes.
[02:58:17.774 --> 02:58:18.275]  So what?
[02:58:18.335 --> 02:58:20.015]  I mean, so you guys can blow the planet up.
[02:58:20.055 --> 02:58:23.897]  I mean, the mere fact that you're like this does not mean you rule everything.
[02:58:24.818 --> 02:58:28.800]  Yeah, and so these are the same people that tried to blow up the stratosphere, I'm sure, as you've talked about.
[02:58:28.820 --> 02:58:29.800]  Yeah, and set the atmosphere on fire.
[02:58:29.840 --> 02:58:30.661]  Yeah, they're not very nice.
[02:58:31.281 --> 02:58:37.404]  So, uh, yeah, I just can't say... What's wrong with trying to blow a hole and try to catch the atmosphere on fire and kill everybody?
[02:58:38.359 --> 02:58:39.540]  I mean, they had to test it, didn't they?
[02:58:39.600 --> 02:58:40.581]  I mean, that's normal, right?
[02:58:41.162 --> 02:58:43.184]  I mean, Bill Gates isn't psychopathic or anything, is he?
[02:58:43.805 --> 02:58:44.605]  Well, I mean, we're in a race.
[02:58:44.686 --> 02:58:46.628]  As you said, the whole point is... Stay there.
[02:58:46.648 --> 02:58:47.769]  I'm coming back to you in Overdrive.
[02:58:47.969 --> 02:58:48.690]  Mikhail Thelen.
[02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:50.131]  The story's on Infowars.com.
[02:58:50.471 --> 02:58:50.912]  Get it out.
[02:58:50.992 --> 02:58:52.173]  Infowarslife.com.

[02:58:53.214 --> 02:58:53.855]  Buy the products.
[02:58:53.875 --> 02:58:54.496]  We need your help.
[02:58:55.176 --> 02:58:56.037]  We're going to the next level.
[02:58:56.057 --> 02:58:57.218]  We're at ramming speed here.
[02:58:57.258 --> 02:58:58.540]  Just give us the power.
[02:58:58.600 --> 02:58:59.621]  We'll run over the enemy.
[02:59:00.535 --> 02:59:09.078]  What disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time?
[02:59:09.438 --> 02:59:16.020]  NASA has already set the countdown timer and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[02:59:16.560 --> 02:59:20.001]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[02:59:20.041 --> 02:59:21.242]  population could perish.
[02:59:21.682 --> 02:59:24.683]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[02:59:25.143 --> 02:59:26.924]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[02:59:27.404 --> 02:59:28.664]  Mass riots will follow.
[02:59:29.045 --> 02:59:30.765]  Ancient diseases will reemerge.
[02:59:31.225 --> 02:59:34.747]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?
[02:59:35.287 --> 02:59:40.969]  Go to darkestdays.info to find out proven methods of protecting yourself, your loved ones,
[02:59:41.229 --> 02:59:42.370]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:09.258 --> 03:00:14.806]  Last night on my orders, America's armed forces began strikes against ISIL targets in Syria.
[03:00:17.610 --> 03:00:18.852]  Can't you hear the president?
[03:00:19.953 --> 03:00:20.915]  They want to cut his head off!
[03:00:20.975 --> 03:00:21.696]  He's a hero!
[03:00:21.736 --> 03:00:22.617]  He's battling them!
[03:00:22.637 --> 03:00:23.719]  I love Obama!
[03:00:30.691 --> 03:00:32.675]  Terrorist, your game is through!
[03:00:32.815 --> 03:00:35.339]  Oh yeah!
[03:00:42.666 --> 03:00:47.748]  I thought, um... I thought they wiped out Al-Qaeda for 14 years.
[03:00:48.228 --> 03:00:49.508]  Oh, now they've metastasized.
[03:00:49.528 --> 03:00:50.588]  They're back 50 times bigger.
[03:00:50.608 --> 03:00:51.209]  Oh my gosh!
[03:00:51.229 --> 03:00:53.629]  They want to cut off the president's head!
[03:00:53.849 --> 03:00:54.670]  Run for the hills!
[03:00:55.290 --> 03:00:58.471]  The people we are fighting today, we funded.
[03:00:58.531 --> 03:01:02.532]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones.
[03:01:02.892 --> 03:01:06.173]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:01:08.971 --> 03:01:16.254]  ISIS has grabbed up from the US, from the Saudis, from the Qataris, weapons by the truckload.
[03:01:17.114 --> 03:01:23.297]  And we are now forced to fight against our own weapons, and this body wants to throw more weapons into the mix.
[03:01:31.010 --> 03:01:32.972]  Thank you, Warren Buffett.
[03:01:33.052 --> 03:01:34.453]  Thank you, George Soros.
[03:01:34.933 --> 03:01:36.935]  Oh, you care about the children.
[03:01:36.995 --> 03:01:38.817]  Oh, yeah, I love you.
[03:01:39.237 --> 03:01:39.737]  Okay, sorry.
[03:01:39.797 --> 03:01:41.219]  Mikel Thelen, getting serious here.
[03:01:41.239 --> 03:01:44.722]  I get like this in the third hour sometimes.
[03:01:45.562 --> 03:01:46.043]  It's all good.
[03:01:46.283 --> 03:01:46.923]  It's all good.
[03:01:48.445 --> 03:01:49.966]  Actually, you've been working here.
[03:01:50.046 --> 03:01:52.768]  You get your orders from the Vatican, Israel, and the space station?
[03:01:52.788 --> 03:01:53.329]  Mm-hmm.
[03:01:54.069 --> 03:01:55.671]  Gremlins also, usually after midnight.
[03:01:55.691 --> 03:01:56.371]  No, let's be serious.
[03:01:56.892 --> 03:01:59.134]  Where do you get your walking orders from around here?
[03:01:59.990 --> 03:02:06.720]  Uh, you know, we're kind of left to our own devices here for the most part, and occasionally you'll ask, you know, hey, someone should cover this, but otherwise...
[03:02:07.790 --> 03:02:07.990]  You know?
[03:02:08.210 --> 03:02:10.031]  There's a lot of world government going on out there.
[03:02:10.331 --> 03:02:11.571]  Of course, it doesn't exist.
[03:02:11.591 --> 03:02:16.673]  I've had the anchor for ABC Nightly News here, showing like five clips of people calling for world government, world leaders.
[03:02:16.693 --> 03:02:18.774]  He goes, well, that's a different world government you're talking about.
[03:02:19.334 --> 03:02:20.455]  And then here comes Nightline.
[03:02:20.875 --> 03:02:24.897]  He claims they're setting up a corporate world government and wouldn't put any of the clips in.
[03:02:25.217 --> 03:02:26.757]  And here's Bill Gates again calling for it.
[03:02:26.997 --> 03:02:27.398]  Exactly.
[03:02:28.138 --> 03:02:29.178]  So he said it didn't exist.
[03:02:29.318 --> 03:02:32.880]  And then when they come out and say, yes, it does exist, they say, well, it's not the one you were talking about.
[03:02:33.020 --> 03:02:33.180]  So.
[03:02:34.122 --> 03:02:42.195]  And I said they're going to put all these boxes in the cars and remote-tax us and track us, and then control our speed, just like we said with the smart meters, because they said they'd do it.
[03:02:42.795 --> 03:02:43.497]  And they go, no we're not.
[03:02:43.517 --> 03:02:44.358]  And they're like, yes we are.
[03:02:44.859 --> 03:02:45.500]  And then, no we're not.
[03:02:45.740 --> 03:02:46.181]  Yes we are.
[03:02:46.401 --> 03:02:46.742]  No we're not.
[03:02:46.942 --> 03:02:47.282]  Yes we are.
[03:02:47.543 --> 03:02:48.564]  And then it all happens.
[03:02:49.326 --> 03:02:58.956]  Well, it's really what we need to do is try to either stop this, but like as you said for so many years, we need to let people know who's responsible for these things before they happen, so if they do happen, people will- It's the psycho eugenicists!
[03:02:58.976 --> 03:03:01.319]  His dad was army intelligence, ran Planned Parenthood.
[03:03:01.699 --> 03:03:03.621]  I mean, Bill Gates is beyond Adolf Hitler.
[03:03:03.821 --> 03:03:10.228]  Yeah, I mean- I remember his wife last year in Germany threatened her when she said, those of you trying to stop our projects, you better watch it or even more will die.
[03:03:10.248 --> 03:03:10.909]  It was very cryptic.
[03:03:11.129 --> 03:03:19.475]  Yeah, I mean, everything he's involved in, from geoengineering to Monsanto, to you name it, to USAID overseas pushing these crops.
[03:03:20.416 --> 03:03:21.857]  Who do you think's more evil?
[03:03:21.897 --> 03:03:24.599]  We should have a video contest or something.
[03:03:25.379 --> 03:03:27.120]  People would put together a montage of showing evidence.
[03:03:27.140 --> 03:03:28.842]  Who's more evil, George Soros or Bill Gates?
[03:03:30.403 --> 03:03:34.686]  I might have to say Gates, but... Who is the most evil man in the world contest?
[03:03:35.666 --> 03:03:36.387]  Maybe Kissinger?
[03:03:38.430 --> 03:03:41.151]  Yeah, but there's spiders even more wicked that we don't even see behind them.
[03:03:41.171 --> 03:03:43.252]  Hanging out at the Bohemian Grove.
[03:03:46.613 --> 03:03:47.134]  What do you think?
[03:03:48.634 --> 03:03:55.017]  Man, I just, it's the same names, you know, Kissinger, Rockefeller, just all those old little demons.
[03:03:56.157 --> 03:04:00.419]  And then meanwhile, it all comes out that the British Parliament, our government, is a bunch of pedophiles.
[03:04:01.099 --> 03:04:04.301]  And we're not talking about just raping kids, we're talking about running over them with cars, torturing them.
[03:04:05.455 --> 03:04:11.558]  You know, that was one of the things that really woke me up was your interview with Senator John DeCamp in about 2004 about the kids in Bohemian Grove.
[03:04:11.958 --> 03:04:22.583]  And so, it's funny because, you know, you've been talking about this for years and now it's mainstream news and everyone's acting all surprised that the people who run the- Well, I mean, you know, chopping a five-year-old's head off after you torture him, that's what you do if you're not a commie.
[03:04:23.984 --> 03:04:24.404]  It's good, guys.
[03:04:26.212 --> 03:04:28.013]  And again, they said, what are you saying, our government did that?
[03:04:28.073 --> 03:04:28.253]  No!
[03:04:28.393 --> 03:04:35.016]  Criminals have gotten control, they have made it the government's secret, and now they want to destroy everything to secure their power.
[03:04:35.297 --> 03:04:37.618]  Because they don't like seeing you with a happy wife and children.
[03:04:37.818 --> 03:04:41.099]  They don't like seeing you in flyover country with swimming pools and money in the bank.
[03:04:41.140 --> 03:04:43.701]  They want to run your life, and to do that, they've got to make you poor.
[03:04:44.641 --> 03:04:45.081]  Exactly.
[03:04:45.862 --> 03:04:46.402]  Cloud and Piven.
[03:04:46.782 --> 03:04:48.743]  A big, giant, stinking world government.
[03:04:48.763 --> 03:04:50.704]  A big, giant, stinking pile of Bill Gates.
[03:04:51.265 --> 03:04:54.566]  From now on, whenever I say something's BS, I'm going to go, it's Bill Gates.
[03:04:55.307 --> 03:04:55.587]  BG.
[03:04:57.791 --> 03:04:59.092]  That is a load of Bill Gates.
[03:05:00.092 --> 03:05:00.512]  Agreed.
[03:05:01.133 --> 03:05:03.654]  Like, Quinn Elizabeth II is a number two.
[03:05:03.674 --> 03:05:05.114]  You have to learn to change all the words over.
[03:05:05.415 --> 03:05:07.796]  Hey, they take themselves so seriously, that's why we expose them.
[03:05:08.056 --> 03:05:08.996]  Hey, well, I appreciate you.
[03:05:09.016 --> 03:05:09.716]  Good job on the article.
[03:05:12.638 --> 03:05:13.838]  This alert just came in.
[03:05:14.158 --> 03:05:17.180]  The afterlife is filled with unexpected challenges.
[03:05:17.940 --> 03:05:19.661]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat
