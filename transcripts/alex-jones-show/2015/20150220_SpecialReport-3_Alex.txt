[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:02.531]  And don't tell me that I'm a weirdo because I'm upset about this.
[00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:04.752]  I'm just sick of dishonorable trash.
[00:00:04.992 --> 00:00:08.135]  Supreme Cobra Commander!
[00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:08.995]  You're failures!
[00:00:09.035 --> 00:00:11.657]  You think I'd sell my family out like you dirtbag?
[00:00:13.203 --> 00:00:15.584]  Jakari Jackson for Infowars.com.
[00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:19.044]  Campus rape is a very serious allegation and should be treated as such.
[00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:24.606]  But what if you, an innocent person, are caught up in the net and are being punished for a crime that you did not commit?
[00:00:24.886 --> 00:00:29.207]  Innocent college student subject to restraining order for resembling alleged rapist.
[00:00:29.387 --> 00:00:40.970]  An innocent male student was reportedly banned from entering large areas of his liberal arts school in Oregon after a female classmate accused him of slightly resembling a rapist she encountered months prior in another state.
[00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:56.496]  He was ordered to stay away from a fellow student, cutting him off from his housing, his campus job, and educational opportunity, all because he reminded her of a man who had raped her months before and thousands of miles away, said Professor Janie Haley of the Harvard Law Review.
[00:00:56.596 --> 00:01:03.058]  Which is to say, after a thorough investigation, this man has been proven innocent, but is still being punished for a crime that he did not commit.
[00:01:03.418 --> 00:01:10.501]  And I'll do sympathies to the young lady, but now this young man is having his educational opportunities ruined because he slightly resembles a perpetrator.
[00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:17.327]  And going from an innocent man to people who are definitely guilty but were able to continue their crimes because of political correctness.
[00:01:17.608 --> 00:01:22.773]  About 1,400 Rotterdam children sexually exploited over a 16-year period.
[00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:26.497]  The Uncompromising report on events in South Yorkshire town between 1997 and 2013
[00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.363]  Said in more than a third of these cases, the youngsters were already known to child protective agencies.
[00:01:34.643 --> 00:01:39.646]  The report said, by far, the majority of the perpetrators were described as Asian by the victim.
[00:01:39.826 --> 00:01:45.450]  But the investigator said, counselors seemed to think it was a one-off problem they hoped would go away.
[00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.832]  And several staff described their nervousness.
[00:01:48.252 --> 00:01:53.196]  About identifying the ethnic origins of the perpetrators for fear of being thought racist.
[00:01:53.576 --> 00:01:57.779]  Political correctness allowed these rapists to run wild in the Rotterdam streets.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.263]  Now let me be very clear, I'm not saying all Asians are rapists or Muslims or anything like that.
[00:02:02.563 --> 00:02:07.007]  It was these particular men who just so happened to be Asian, but they didn't want to come down on these guys.
[00:02:07.027 --> 00:02:10.009]  They didn't want to go round them up because of their ethnic origin.
[00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:16.234]  And these are the type of political correctness things we see in our societies and allow guilty people to get away with their crimes.
