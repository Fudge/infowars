[00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:13.456]  In the wake of the terror in Paris, President Obama is blatantly disregarding the very real concerns of the American people.
[00:00:13.796 --> 00:00:33.989]  Rather than review the policy to bring in 10,000 Syrian refugees after the horror the world witnessed just five days ago, Obama clutches like a madman to his power and stays the course on the Bilderberg-fueled globalist demand that he oust President Bashir al-Assad from Syria.
[00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:48.632]  Rather than do whatever it takes to protect the United States, Obama is leaving the gates wide open as he shuns the overwhelming concerns of Americans and aids an invading force to quietly enter the United States.
[00:00:49.012 --> 00:01:02.835]  People are flooding social media to encourage Americans to call their congressional representatives to stop the resettlement of Middle Eastern migrants after government officials and contractors admitted the migrants cannot be tracked.
[00:01:03.495 --> 00:01:05.897]  In comparison, only 3 of the 19 states are democratic.
[00:01:05.937 --> 00:01:09.280]  The FBI has already admitted the US can't vet all the migrants for terror ties.
[00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:35.017]  We can only query against that which we have collected.
[00:01:35.918 --> 00:01:51.964]  And so if someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home, but nothing will show up because we have no record on it.
[00:01:52.284 --> 00:01:54.565]  You can only query what you've collected.
[00:01:55.245 --> 00:02:02.068]  And with respect to Iraqi refugees, we had far more in our databases because of our country's work there for a decade.
[00:02:02.472 --> 00:02:03.652]  This is a different situation.
[00:02:03.812 --> 00:02:10.654]  In the case of Syria, you can't go to the government offices in that country.
[00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:11.654]  They're in disarray.
[00:02:11.694 --> 00:02:15.435]  You can't go interview people who know people who are applying for this status.
[00:02:17.555 --> 00:02:31.398]  Do you disagree with the FBI director when he says that vetting Syrian refugees is extremely difficult, if not impossible?
[00:02:32.557 --> 00:02:34.838]  Well, Mr. Chairman, I'm not sure he said it was impossible.
[00:02:35.158 --> 00:02:43.359]  Certainly, not only the Department of Justice, but all of our agencies will make every effort to vet every refugee coming into this country.
[00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:49.661]  From the databases, to the interviews that those individuals are subject to, to the biometric screening as well.
[00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:50.141]  Let me go on.
[00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:54.882]  Certainly there are challenges to that process because of the situation in Syria.
[00:02:55.376 --> 00:02:59.379]  Recently, a Syrian migrant who was relocated to Louisiana went missing.
[00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.502]  The group accommodating him admitted it doesn't track the migrants.
[00:03:03.862 --> 00:03:12.448]  The LA Times is reporting that more than half the country's governors, citing security concerns, said they would refuse Syrian refugees.
[00:03:13.308 --> 00:03:20.292]  And those Syrian refugees are all headed, not to the big cities, but to the small towns of Main Street, America.
[00:03:20.592 --> 00:03:23.734]  While ISIS calls for attacks on Washington D.C.
[00:03:24.294 --> 00:03:30.617]  and ramps up the possibility of a terror attack on one of the many cities found on the ISIS kill list.
[00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:33.079]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:03:45.373 --> 00:03:51.495]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:03:51.515 --> 00:03:54.837]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:03:54.857 --> 00:03:56.557]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:03:56.597 --> 00:04:02.840]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.842]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:04:09.002 --> 00:04:12.747]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:15.830]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:24.041]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:04:24.321 --> 00:04:26.363]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:04:26.423 --> 00:04:27.465]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:36.557]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
