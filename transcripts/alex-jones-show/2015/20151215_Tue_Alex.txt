[00:00:00.707 --> 00:00:03.293]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:15.538 --> 00:00:15.998]  Stand by.
[00:00:16.038 --> 00:00:16.679]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:18.380]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.241]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:21.662]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.742 --> 00:00:23.362]  So do I. Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:27.645]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:32.247]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:42.729]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this live, worldwide, Tuesday edition, the 15th day of December, 2015.
[00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.053]  We have Wayne Madsen joining us, investigative journalist with big breaking news on the campaign trail.
[00:00:50.413 --> 00:00:59.178]  Michael Springman, former head of the Jetta Visa section, to deal with all the visa news, how terrorists and others are being given visas into the United States coming up.
[00:00:59.978 --> 00:01:11.111]  We have California's one of its largest schools shut down today because of unspecified terrorist threat that supposedly came over that references the TV show Homeland.
[00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:15.375]  And also New York schools are looking at shutting down right now.
[00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:17.918]  Talk about the wicked flee when none pursue.
[00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.002]  They open the borders up, bring in the terrorist.
[00:01:21.482 --> 00:01:30.907]  And then we become a basically catatonic fetal position society, teaching our children how to get in fetal positions and be shot in the head.
[00:01:31.547 --> 00:01:34.049]  So that is all coming up.
[00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:42.794]  But first, John Bowne looks at the big assault, the middle class, the latter out of being poor, so you can be independent being destroyed.
[00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:46.796]  President Obama's record-breaking national debt.
[00:01:47.396 --> 00:01:50.678]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.681]  Increase our debt.
[00:01:53.001 --> 00:02:03.869]  Increasing Obamacare tax penalties and premiums, blue-collar depleting trade deals, and overall Salinski-esque tactics are demolishing the American middle class.
[00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:20.022]  As we near the finish line of Obama's two terms, the only change we've experienced is a totalitarian transformation of the presidential office begun by his criminal counterparts that have continuously seized the throne since JFK was gunned down in Dallas.
[00:02:23.482 --> 00:02:31.550]  Breitbart reports Pew Research found that the share of American adults living in middle income households has fallen from 61% in 1971 to 50% in 2015.
[00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.233]  The share living in the upper income tier rose from 14% to 21% over the same period.
[00:02:35.394 --> 00:02:39.217]  Meanwhile, the share in the lower income tier increased from 25% to 29%.
[00:02:48.246 --> 00:02:51.169]  Manufacturing accounted for 26% of employed adults in 1971, compared with 11% in 2014.
[00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.273]  A Gallup poll discovered that since the year 2000 through 2008, 10% of middle class to upper middle class of Americans transferred into the lower class.
[00:03:07.744 --> 00:03:13.027]  62% of Americans have under $1,000 in savings.
[00:03:13.347 --> 00:03:20.212]  Meanwhile, Obamacare will raise the penalty next year by 50% for not participating to $1,000.
[00:03:21.913 --> 00:03:25.395]  Just to make sure that anybody struggling can't get ahead.
[00:03:25.675 --> 00:03:34.401]  So their goal has always been to eliminate the middle class, raise taxes, give away their health care to poor and illegals, flood the country with immigrants.
[00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:47.531]  Degrade our position abroad, do everything they can to eliminate the foundation of what supports the free market system and that is the only threat to their having a permanent hold on power.
[00:03:47.851 --> 00:03:50.013]  The goal is to keep a permanent hold on power.
[00:03:50.794 --> 00:04:00.481]  When I grew up, I guess it was years before you grew up, but we had a country of middle-class families who had intact nuclear families.
[00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:06.586]  That is, the mother and father were married to each other and raising their own children in one household.
[00:04:07.507 --> 00:04:11.850]  And now, that's just a minority of people in our country.
[00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:17.187]  But the nuclear family was a self-contained economic unit.
[00:04:17.307 --> 00:04:21.768]  They spent their own money, made their own decisions, decided how they were going to raise their children.
[00:04:22.408 --> 00:04:30.730]  The now pseudo-privileged, financially doomed millennial generation has proclaimed the death of the American dream, according to a Harvard poll.
[00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:40.172]  Blindly throwing their collective votes towards the socialist promises of Bernie Sanders out of total desperation, the millennial generation workforce
[00:04:40.632 --> 00:04:43.374]  Still makes up 40% of the unemployed.
[00:04:43.674 --> 00:04:52.941]  This generation will overtake the baby boomer generation as the nation's largest living population approaching 75 million strong.
[00:04:53.201 --> 00:05:03.409]  A generation that will inherit the mind-controlling PC culture, dwindling middle class numbers, Obamacare penalties and rate hikes, and crippling student debt.
[00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.872]  If you thought the middle class was in trouble now, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:05:09.887 --> 00:05:15.171]  A New York City principal has banned Christmas and the Pledge of Allegiance, reports EAG News.
[00:05:15.591 --> 00:05:24.677]  The new principal has also eliminated Thanksgiving, despite clear notice from the city's Department of Education allowing for holiday themes and symbols, the New York Post writes.
[00:05:25.017 --> 00:05:27.019]  We definitely can't say Christmas.
[00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:32.302]  Nothing with Christmas on it, nothing with Santa, a local PTA president told the news site.
[00:05:32.663 --> 00:05:33.443]  No angels.
[00:05:33.803 --> 00:05:38.627]  We can't even have a star because it can represent a religious system, like the Star of David.
[00:05:39.247 --> 00:05:46.590]  The report states that about 95% of the students at Brooklyn's PS169 are either Hispanic or Asian.
[00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:54.714]  And the assistant principal announced last month that the school is changing its holiday traditions to be sensitive to the diversity of our families.
[00:05:55.434 --> 00:05:58.335]  Not all children celebrate the same holidays, he added.
[00:05:58.955 --> 00:06:02.637]  And the Pledge of Allegiance was also ditched when the principal took office.
[00:06:03.117 --> 00:06:06.819]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:06:09.778 --> 00:06:11.099]  I want more candy!
[00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:11.899]  I want more video games!
[00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:12.200]  Why?
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.420]  Why?
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.520]  Why?
[00:06:39.798 --> 00:06:40.218]  I think so.
[00:07:09.838 --> 00:07:19.102]  Infowarslife and Infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winner's Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[00:07:19.342 --> 00:07:23.944]  Winner's Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[00:07:24.024 --> 00:07:28.466]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[00:07:28.806 --> 00:07:31.727]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[00:07:31.847 --> 00:07:33.948]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:37.670]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.693]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[00:07:41.733 --> 00:07:50.399]  The research and development took over two years, but the result, as verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:55.523]  Read the facts at InfoWarsLife.com about Winter Sun vitamin D3.
[00:07:55.803 --> 00:08:01.367]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[00:08:01.728 --> 00:08:03.513]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[00:08:03.854 --> 00:08:06.521]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[00:08:14.016 --> 00:08:15.157]  It's never gonna get any better.
[00:08:15.557 --> 00:08:16.278]  Don't look for it.
[00:08:16.698 --> 00:08:17.819]  Be happy with what you got.
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.022]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[00:08:22.583 --> 00:08:24.244]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[00:08:24.624 --> 00:08:25.705]  The real owners.
[00:08:25.765 --> 00:08:30.288]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:31.890]  Forget the politicians.
[00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.392]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[00:08:36.974 --> 00:08:37.374]  You don't.
[00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.150]  You have no choice.
[00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.471]  You have owners.
[00:08:40.771 --> 00:08:41.812]  They own you.
[00:08:43.033 --> 00:08:44.333]  They own everything.
[00:08:44.574 --> 00:08:46.215]  They own all the important land.
[00:08:46.575 --> 00:08:48.316]  They own and control the corporations.
[00:08:48.356 --> 00:08:51.819]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls.
[00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:53.420]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.583]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[00:08:58.744 --> 00:09:00.385]  They got you by the balls!
[00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.957]  They want obedient workers.
[00:09:04.417 --> 00:09:05.919]  Obedient workers.
[00:09:06.239 --> 00:09:18.930]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.253]  And now, they're coming for your social security money.
[00:09:22.713 --> 00:09:25.376]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[00:09:26.797 --> 00:09:27.698]  It's a big club.
[00:09:28.675 --> 00:09:29.716]  And you ain't in it.
[00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:35.039]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:36.260]  You better believe it.
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.241]  So what specifically did they do?
[00:09:38.702 --> 00:09:43.865]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand.
[00:09:44.065 --> 00:09:44.685]  A lot of money.
[00:09:45.306 --> 00:09:48.008]  You and I are not in the big club.
[00:09:48.368 --> 00:09:50.309]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:54.652]  It's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[00:09:56.075 --> 00:09:57.556]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[00:09:57.936 --> 00:10:01.439]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[00:10:01.459 --> 00:10:05.382]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[00:10:05.422 --> 00:10:06.322]  They're not interested in that.
[00:10:06.622 --> 00:10:07.563]  That doesn't help them.
[00:10:07.943 --> 00:10:09.324]  That's against their interest.
[00:10:09.825 --> 00:10:10.245]  That's right.
[00:10:10.505 --> 00:10:15.549]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:10:18.237 --> 00:10:30.200]  And that's George Carlin, another great intro produced by InfoWars' own Darren McBreen, bringing us in to this live Tuesday, the 15th day of December, global broadcast.
[00:10:30.561 --> 00:10:46.225]  Hard to believe, again, that 2015 is almost over, but in just 15 and a half days it will be history, and we will plunge into 2016, and even more critical developments will clearly unfold as we plunge into world government.
[00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:57.611]  You see, George Carlin was talking about how the owners, the globalists, wanted dumbed-down, mindless, poor servants decades ago.
[00:10:58.211 --> 00:11:14.159]  But the decision has been made, and it's been in Wired Magazine, and the New York Times, and the Financial Times of London, and in books by Ray Kurzweil, and in articles by Bill Joy, and now it's pretty much in the news every day what I was talking about 18, 19 years ago.
[00:11:17.332 --> 00:11:26.334]  The global architects are building a planet and building a world system meant to phase out 90 plus percent of humanity as we know it.
[00:11:27.114 --> 00:11:28.415]  Now that's the public numbers.
[00:11:29.035 --> 00:11:42.238]  Deeper internal discussions are about exterminating all humans and a few mega super elites battling for control of the new AI consciousness over who will become God.
[00:11:43.118 --> 00:11:44.398]  Ray Kurzweil is an atheist.
[00:11:44.878 --> 00:11:46.279]  He says he doesn't believe in God yet.
[00:11:48.715 --> 00:11:53.419]  Now, whether you believe they're going to be able to do this or not, this is their idea.
[00:11:54.479 --> 00:11:55.860]  This is what they're pushing.
[00:11:56.481 --> 00:11:57.682]  This is what they want.
[00:11:57.702 --> 00:11:59.503]  This is what they discuss.
[00:12:00.244 --> 00:12:03.066]  Elon Musk is in the news, and I'm not saying he's one of the bad ones.
[00:12:03.706 --> 00:12:06.789]  He's probably one of the better elites, because he's new money.
[00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:11.813]  He's saying, hey, there's going to be a third world war.
[00:12:12.954 --> 00:12:14.174]  We're probably going to kill the planet.
[00:12:14.214 --> 00:12:15.636]  We've got to get space bases now.
[00:12:15.936 --> 00:12:17.157]  We've got to get to Mars now.
[00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:22.080]  Headline, Elon Musk worries Third World War would ruin Mars mission.
[00:12:23.661 --> 00:12:29.365]  Buddy, the weapons the Pentagon's got now, they're not even sure because they can't test them, might blow up the whole solar system.
[00:12:31.266 --> 00:12:35.969]  A-bombs were developed, the idea, the formulae, in 1900 by Max Planck.
[00:12:36.369 --> 00:12:37.450]  We're not in 1900.
[00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:41.433]  You can blow up whole cities in 1900 with the equations.
[00:12:41.773 --> 00:12:45.135]  The equations now blow up whole solar systems.
[00:12:45.716 --> 00:12:47.137]  It's called antimatter weapons.
[00:12:48.561 --> 00:12:51.662]  And it makes a hydrogen bomb look like a tinker toy.
[00:12:52.403 --> 00:12:57.985]  Look like a dart gun that a five-year-old has that, you know, shoots rubber darts at the stained glass window.
[00:13:03.668 --> 00:13:06.229]  And the Air Force admits they've developed antimatter weapons.
[00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:12.332]  It's kind of like Putin will leak some nuclear submarine torpedo that can take out U.S.
[00:13:12.372 --> 00:13:12.752]  cities.
[00:13:13.512 --> 00:13:15.353]  He'll leak it on accident last month.
[00:13:15.393 --> 00:13:17.214]  Well, the Pentagon's leaked.
[00:13:19.148 --> 00:13:22.271]  Now, let's go ahead and just mention what's coming up in the news today.
[00:13:22.291 --> 00:13:24.733]  I think that's probably important to do right up front.
[00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:50.283]  Michael Springman, who headed up the U.S.
[00:13:50.363 --> 00:13:59.170]  Visa Department in Saudi Arabia, who exposed that they were ordered to let the hijackers into the United States and were told that they were CIA officers.
[00:14:00.491 --> 00:14:03.594]  Not just assets, but members of the CIA.
[00:14:04.655 --> 00:14:09.399]  The book is Visas for Al Qaeda, CIA handouts that rock the world.
[00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:12.462]  We sell the book at Infowarsstore.com, I would add.
[00:14:14.068 --> 00:14:15.930]  And why is that guest so important?
[00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:17.331]  I'll explain that in a moment.
[00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:20.853]  Then Wayne Madsen with big election news joins us in the third hour.
[00:14:21.154 --> 00:14:28.960]  Jakari Jackson will be hosting the fourth hour today and he's got a big show he's developing so before he comes on I'll give you a rundown of what's coming up in the fourth hour.
[00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:40.149]  Then tonight we'll have at least three hours of live coverage and I intend to be part of the coverage tonight of the final Republican debate
[00:14:41.599 --> 00:14:42.519]  Of 2015.
[00:14:43.179 --> 00:14:44.500]  From Las Vegas, Nevada.
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.421]  The big showdown between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.
[00:14:47.761 --> 00:14:50.401]  The media hyping it like a heavyweight championship.
[00:14:53.222 --> 00:14:59.384]  Ted Cruz has basically had a couple knockouts, a couple technical knockouts, and has been knocked out himself.
[00:15:00.144 --> 00:15:07.066]  And then Donald Trump has the equivalent of like 20 knockouts and is a heavyweight champion, if you want to compare their poll numbers.
[00:15:08.302 --> 00:15:14.668]  But they're billing Cruz as if he's surging and could beat Trump because they want that to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:15:15.408 --> 00:15:16.669]  I like Ted Cruz overall.
[00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.412]  I like 95% of what he stands for.
[00:15:19.612 --> 00:15:20.613]  Same thing with Donald Trump.
[00:15:20.893 --> 00:15:21.894]  There's some things I don't like.
[00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:33.765]  But I'll tell you, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, or Donald Trump are leagues, levels, dimensions, light years better.
[00:15:35.646 --> 00:15:39.169]  Then a Hillary Clinton, a Bernie Sanders, or a Jeb Bush.
[00:15:39.609 --> 00:15:43.192]  I will not vote for any of those people, and I will support third-party move.
[00:15:44.013 --> 00:15:46.415]  Because a Hillary getting in would be better than a Jeb Bush.
[00:15:46.815 --> 00:15:53.281]  Jeb Bush gets in, everybody goes, sleepy time, like Sleeping Beauty, and the whole agenda gets rammed through and we're done.
[00:15:53.901 --> 00:15:56.303]  He's roping borders, taking our guns, you name it.
[00:15:56.563 --> 00:15:59.786]  But a lot of Republicans just want to feel like they're on a winning team.
[00:15:59.846 --> 00:16:03.069]  They will go into sleeping time.
[00:16:03.449 --> 00:16:04.470]  They will go bye-bye.
[00:16:05.575 --> 00:16:13.938]  Hillary gets in, she's got so much baggage, so much corruption, Benghazi, all the rest of it, that she will get impeached, she will get destroyed.
[00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:18.900]  I know they'll play the whole feminine card that, oh, you don't like women.
[00:16:19.161 --> 00:16:20.361]  No, I love women.
[00:16:21.862 --> 00:16:25.383]  And I love women in positions of power, if they're not criminals, scumbag, crazy people.
[00:16:27.064 --> 00:16:29.945]  And Hillary Clinton is probably one of the most evil women that has ever lived.
[00:16:30.762 --> 00:16:37.590]  What she did to Libya, what she's done to so many other countries, what she did with the banker bailouts, how they engineered that when Clinton was in.
[00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:41.434]  I mean, Clinton was running around having sex with women all day and hanging out with world leaders.
[00:16:41.755 --> 00:16:43.156]  I'm not saying he was a good guy, he was horrible.
[00:16:43.797 --> 00:16:45.960]  But Hillary was actually in there honchoing stuff.
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.143]  Hillary was basically president when Bill was in.
[00:16:49.804 --> 00:17:02.692]  She's the one that really calls the shots, that calls for the murders, that calls, you know, covers up the rapes, that sells the missile secrets, that runs the State Department with billions of dollars coming in to give dictators weapons.
[00:17:04.153 --> 00:17:08.616]  I mean, she really is anathema to anything good and decent, so that's coming up.
[00:17:10.233 --> 00:17:28.661]  Tonight, seven o'clock central, there'll be a big link at the top of InfoWars.com, a big banner, a big, I guess, chevron or symbol or logo up in the right-hand corner that you click to and go to a page where there'll be a free feed of the InfoWars Expanded Nightly News.
[00:17:28.721 --> 00:17:31.702]  It'll go for at least three hours, probably seven to ten tonight.
[00:17:33.172 --> 00:17:39.995]  I intend to be doing live reports, just so it has a different flair from my home office.
[00:17:41.916 --> 00:17:47.959]  During the reports, I will be Skyping in to the show to comment.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.901]  Joe Biggs will be going over Twitter and Facebook comments.
[00:17:51.641 --> 00:17:53.282]  So will Darren McBreen from one of the other studios.
[00:17:53.682 --> 00:17:58.645]  Jakari Jackson, David Knight, LeeAnn McAdoo, and others will be in here in the studio along with Rob Dube.
[00:17:59.682 --> 00:18:03.005]  And again, it will be the debate, but we talk over it.
[00:18:03.926 --> 00:18:06.089]  About half of it, and analyze it in live time.
[00:18:06.349 --> 00:18:12.495]  That's how we can legally and lawfully do it, is because we are not entertainment, we are news gathering.
[00:18:13.536 --> 00:18:20.463]  And we're going to be analyzing the debate, the media propaganda, the spin, the questions in live time.
[00:18:20.864 --> 00:18:21.705]  Nobody else does this.
[00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:25.730]  Seven o'clock Central Standard Time tonight.
[00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.132]  And we also do analysis of State of the Union, many other events, others do that.
[00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:32.894]  All right, that said, Michael Springman, who headed up the U.S.
[00:18:32.934 --> 00:18:43.459]  Visa Department in the main Saudi Arabian office, will be joining us, author and constitutional lawyer, because look at these bombshells.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:50.002]  Immigration officials prohibited from looking at visa applicants' social media.
[00:18:51.567 --> 00:18:55.889]  Where they were saying, I'm going to carry out a jihad, I've been in terror training camps, I pledge allegiance to ISIS.
[00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.171]  Folks, that's just not true.
[00:18:58.551 --> 00:19:00.292]  They track everything our reporters do.
[00:19:00.332 --> 00:19:07.236]  We try to go cover jihad camps, Homeland Security's there, calling our folks up and telling them exactly where they are on what highway.
[00:19:07.816 --> 00:19:14.180]  Because they're tracking their phones in real time, they're tracking the vehicles in real time, they're tracking the car with license plate reading cameras.
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.221]  It's total horse manure.
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.481]  They are tracking.
[00:19:18.501 --> 00:19:20.082]  When they say they don't track, that's a lie.
[00:19:20.382 --> 00:19:28.509]  They had FBI agents on them, both of them, two years ago, tracking them for a year, and the Justice Department almost indicted them.
[00:19:28.889 --> 00:19:34.533]  It came out in the news last week, and it was looking at criminal charges against them, basically, and shut their investigation down.
[00:19:34.814 --> 00:19:36.675]  The White House protects these people.
[00:19:37.035 --> 00:19:38.036]  This is part of a plan.
[00:19:41.259 --> 00:19:41.539]  U.S.
[00:19:41.579 --> 00:19:42.700]  visas continue to be
[00:19:44.289 --> 00:19:46.070]  Handled by foreign contractors.
[00:19:46.711 --> 00:19:48.673]  Lane Madsen, Infowars.com story.
[00:19:49.493 --> 00:19:51.255]  That ties in with this, the Hill story.
[00:19:51.735 --> 00:19:52.896]  Here's another one, the biggest.
[00:19:53.797 --> 00:20:00.502]  Hackers trace ISIS Twitter accounts back to internet addresses linked to the Department of Work and Pensions, the UK government.
[00:20:01.363 --> 00:20:04.845]  And it's not just that they're in there using them, that's a government front.
[00:20:05.085 --> 00:20:07.968]  The British government runs ISIS, it's well known.
[00:20:10.723 --> 00:20:12.044]  911, what is your emergency?
[00:20:12.104 --> 00:20:13.064]  There's somebody in my house.

[00:21:12.708 --> 00:21:13.429]  Another shooting.
[00:21:13.829 --> 00:21:15.091]  And they're getting worse.
[00:21:15.531 --> 00:21:18.774]  That's why Infidel Body Armor introduces Infidel Fridays.

[00:22:09.372 --> 00:22:12.376]  My name is Bill Bonner and I have an important message.
[00:22:12.697 --> 00:22:17.864]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[00:22:18.184 --> 00:22:20.086]  But they're about to lose control.
[00:22:20.467 --> 00:22:25.414]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[00:22:25.774 --> 00:22:30.278]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:22:30.358 --> 00:22:32.400]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:36.263]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[00:22:36.603 --> 00:22:40.667]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[00:22:41.127 --> 00:22:44.029]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.652]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:22:46.832 --> 00:22:48.233]  This will affect us all.
[00:22:48.693 --> 00:22:52.196]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[00:22:53.397 --> 00:22:59.667]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.

[00:23:09.704 --> 00:23:10.505]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:23:10.525 --> 00:23:12.006]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:23:12.306 --> 00:23:13.607]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:23:13.967 --> 00:23:16.288]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:18.630]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.

[00:23:39.226 --> 00:23:40.006]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:23:40.026 --> 00:23:41.527]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:23:41.827 --> 00:23:43.107]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:23:43.487 --> 00:23:45.808]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:23:46.308 --> 00:23:48.149]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:23:48.589 --> 00:23:52.630]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:56.811]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[00:23:57.051 --> 00:24:00.492]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[00:24:00.812 --> 00:24:01.232]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[00:24:01.252 --> 00:24:02.873]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[00:24:17.992 --> 00:24:41.880]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to drill into the fact that Congress has been grilling DHS over the fact that the no-fly list is a total fraud, and the North Carolina governor and others are coming out saying the feds won't tell us where or who they're bringing in to the United States, and then they just disappear.
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.740]  Even the ones that don't have visas.
[00:24:45.481 --> 00:24:46.361]  This is deliberate.
[00:24:47.742 --> 00:24:48.863]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:49.283 --> 00:24:53.267]  Immigration officials prohibited from looking at visa applicant social media.
[00:24:54.568 --> 00:25:06.720]  See, I knew ISIS was going to be big when they let them recruit in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and let them fly in and out of the countries, and then tried a couple years ago to go, oh, Jihad fighters are actually good.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.563]  We need to rehabilitate them and bring them back into our countries.
[00:25:11.101 --> 00:25:12.181]  Because they were trying to PR.
[00:25:12.221 --> 00:25:13.722]  Hey, how do we bring Al Qaeda back in?
[00:25:13.902 --> 00:25:15.102]  You know, it's our proxy army.
[00:25:15.542 --> 00:25:16.603]  How do we fool folks?
[00:25:17.323 --> 00:25:18.864]  Well, we'll just say we're going to rehabilitate them.
[00:25:19.944 --> 00:25:30.247]  When you give them tow missiles and stinger missiles and the rest of it, and then you bring them back, let select groups blow stuff up, and then you set up bigger homeland security systems to take all of our rights.
[00:25:30.267 --> 00:25:38.030]  You declare martial law in many countries of Europe, and you arrest the conservative party leaders like Le Pen that don't want to bring them in.
[00:25:38.877 --> 00:25:40.818]  But like I said, that's coming up in the next segment.
[00:25:41.178 --> 00:25:43.920]  Because hackers trace ISIS back to the US government.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.661]  That is mainstream news.
[00:25:47.221 --> 00:25:48.722]  The UK Daily Mirror.
[00:25:50.063 --> 00:25:51.043]  Isn't that just special?
[00:25:52.184 --> 00:25:53.745]  Isn't that just cupcake cute?
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:08.350]  And of course, Turkey buys the oil, and the United States bombs the Syrian military bases, and the Turks attack with artillery, and then they sit up there and say, oh, we're battling ISIS.
[00:26:09.031 --> 00:26:10.092]  Yeah, you're their air force.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.883]  And Turkey's now been in Iraq for a week and a half.
[00:26:14.304 --> 00:26:15.365]  They've invaded Iraq.
[00:26:15.686 --> 00:26:16.847]  They're bombing and attacking.
[00:26:17.608 --> 00:26:19.511]  Blowing up Iraqi military.
[00:26:19.571 --> 00:26:20.512]  Blowing up Kurds.
[00:26:21.513 --> 00:26:23.115]  Yeah, it's just not even in our news.
[00:26:23.155 --> 00:26:24.897]  I mean, it's in the back of the paper.
[00:26:24.938 --> 00:26:26.900]  Just, oh hey, Turkey invaded.
[00:26:27.821 --> 00:26:28.102]  Because...
[00:26:31.087 --> 00:26:36.048]  With the Russians and the Iranians, the Iraqis are beating Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:36.808 --> 00:26:37.789]  You know them as ISIS.
[00:26:38.649 --> 00:26:45.390]  I said I'd cover this next segment, I just started talking about it, I have trouble not getting into it, because it is such a raging ridiculousness.
[00:26:48.791 --> 00:27:00.134]  It is so unbelievable that our government started all this, destabilized Iraq, invaded Syria, blew up Libya, overthrew
[00:27:01.511 --> 00:27:01.831]  Egypt.
[00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:18.174]  And then our allies murdered every Christian they could get their hands on and blew up hundreds of churches, crucified Christians upside down, burned them in public, hung them, chopped their heads off, and threw hundreds of homosexuals off high rooftops.
[00:27:18.614 --> 00:27:20.955]  That's how you're supposed to kill them, I guess, in some Islamic idea.
[00:27:21.695 --> 00:27:28.096]  In front of people, on TV, and not a word from Anderson Cooper, the gay rights activist from the CIA.
[00:27:29.892 --> 00:27:35.813]  He would just get up there and talk about how fabulous the demonstrators were and how fabulous their revolution was.
[00:27:36.153 --> 00:27:38.113]  This is who our government wants to put in?
[00:27:39.094 --> 00:27:41.354]  People that throw homosexuals?
[00:27:41.754 --> 00:27:43.074]  See, I'm not supposed to say homosexual.
[00:27:43.134 --> 00:27:45.575]  I'm supposed to talk like Anderson Cooper tells me to.
[00:27:45.875 --> 00:27:47.655]  Not say heterosexual, not say homosexual.
[00:27:47.675 --> 00:27:49.275]  I'm supposed to adopt all of his language.
[00:27:49.536 --> 00:27:53.916]  Straight, gay, Melissa Harris Perry, Darth Vader's racist, brown bags are racist.
[00:27:55.597 --> 00:27:57.157]  When all the real stuff goes on, see,
[00:28:02.327 --> 00:28:06.170]  ISIS executes 10 in public for being homosexual, including boy age 15.
[00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.091]  Yeah, that's just the latest.
[00:28:08.772 --> 00:28:09.873]  Throwing them off rooftops.
[00:28:10.213 --> 00:28:11.454]  That was just one little execution.
[00:28:11.974 --> 00:28:14.877]  Not a word from Gloria Steinem.
[00:28:15.417 --> 00:28:20.241]  If you don't teach your 5-year-old how to be homosexual, you're against gay people, according to these folks.
[00:28:20.501 --> 00:28:25.625]  But if you want to mutilate women, blow up churches, throw people off, that's kind of cute.
[00:28:30.677 --> 00:28:37.501]  But then coming up, I just want to say Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year coming up, because I used to hear this war on Christmas stuff ten years ago and didn't believe it.
[00:28:38.221 --> 00:28:41.223]  And now they're taking the nativity signs out of people's own yards.
[00:28:41.743 --> 00:28:44.145]  People's churches are getting sued, not just government buildings.
[00:28:44.465 --> 00:28:49.168]  And now New York City Elementary Principal bans Christmas, Thanksgiving, Pledge of Allegiance.
[00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.712]  This is being reported on by New York Daily News, you name it, with a straight face.
[00:28:55.092 --> 00:28:56.492]  We definitely can't say Christmas.
[00:28:56.873 --> 00:28:57.713]  You can't say it.
[00:28:58.133 --> 00:28:59.834]  See, now it extends to your free speech.
[00:28:59.874 --> 00:29:00.675]  Of course you can say it.
[00:29:01.595 --> 00:29:02.776]  Nothing with Christmas on it.
[00:29:02.876 --> 00:29:04.957]  Nothing with Santa, who's not even Christian.
[00:29:06.177 --> 00:29:06.878]  He's a elf.
[00:29:09.133 --> 00:29:15.918]  And they have, uh, the principal has banned it, saying, you know, the foreigners don't like it, but they can have all their, their celebrations.
[00:29:15.958 --> 00:29:29.729]  And meanwhile, student gets six months suspension for saying black women are not hot, in a response to a chat board, where reportedly black students were saying that white people were hillbillies, that have sex with their family members, and have small genitals.
[00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:36.153]  And the school actually said blacks are allowed to say that, whites can't even respond, and he was suspended for 20 months.
[00:29:37.574 --> 00:29:40.655]  When they proved that... 21 months, excuse me.
[00:29:40.915 --> 00:29:46.136]  When they proved that it was the black students doing it first, they said, well, they're allowed to, but your suspension's only six months.
[00:29:49.456 --> 00:29:50.497]  How do you like that?
[00:29:51.037 --> 00:29:52.897]  It's only gonna get better, folks.
[00:29:53.277 --> 00:29:57.638]  Because this country is rotting like a big, fat, dead fish in the summer heat.
[00:29:59.299 --> 00:30:00.239]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.699 --> 00:30:02.319]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.219 --> 00:30:05.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.552]  Another GOP debate is upon us.
[00:30:13.052 --> 00:30:18.696]  A time to see how much attention will be allotted to establishment candidates who are dragging in the polls.
[00:30:19.116 --> 00:30:20.877]  These are Republican governors.
[00:30:20.917 --> 00:30:23.139]  They don't give any credit to the free market.
[00:30:23.319 --> 00:30:25.400]  They don't give any credit to the entrepreneur.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.221]  All is not lost, though.
[00:30:27.622 --> 00:30:29.403]  Some are speaking on real issues.
[00:30:29.763 --> 00:30:34.686]  But if you're not going to respond in a no-fly zone strategy, what would yours be?
[00:30:35.307 --> 00:30:38.069]  The first thing I would do is I wouldn't arm our enemies.
[00:30:38.689 --> 00:30:39.610]  I wouldn't arm ISIS.
[00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:40.690]  Yes.
[00:30:41.451 --> 00:30:44.452]  Will controversial statements impact some of the candidates?
[00:30:44.752 --> 00:30:58.519]  Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.

[00:31:08.843 --> 00:31:12.045]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:12.345 --> 00:31:20.350]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:25.614]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:31:26.014 --> 00:31:28.295]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:31:43.232 --> 00:31:47.195]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.

[00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:22.782]  My fellow patriots, one of the things I'm most proud of is the fact that the InfoWars operation reaches more than 20 million people a week worldwide with the message of liberty, and none of it is funded by major global corporations or by taxpayers.
[00:32:23.203 --> 00:32:24.724]  It's funded by free will.
[00:32:25.044 --> 00:32:35.073]  Listeners and viewers like you who decide to visit InfoWarsStore.com and take advantage of some of the most high quality revolutionary products available today and now.

[00:33:05.273 --> 00:33:07.995]  Remember, InfoWars is the operation that you built.
[00:33:21.347 --> 00:33:29.094]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:31.308 --> 00:33:35.011]  Let's be clear, I'm not saying there isn't radical Islamic terror.
[00:33:36.152 --> 00:33:43.038]  What I'm saying is, it's 100% proven in disgusting detail.
[00:33:44.799 --> 00:33:48.682]  In fact, it's not 100% proven, it's 360% proven.
[00:33:48.702 --> 00:33:52.846]  Because 100% is kind of a one or two dimensional statement, depending on how you look at it.
[00:33:54.207 --> 00:33:59.131]  We've proven that Western criminal governments are running radical Islamic terror cells worldwide,
[00:34:01.254 --> 00:34:02.835]  From a 360 perspective.
[00:34:04.176 --> 00:34:12.042]  And they've been caught working with Shiite terrorists back to the 1970s and before as well, but not running them.
[00:34:12.542 --> 00:34:25.331]  But when you talk about Sunni, Wahhabist, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, countries like that, 100% Western run and controlled and funded and protected.
[00:34:25.351 --> 00:34:27.953]  In fact, again, the proper term is 360.
[00:34:30.575 --> 00:34:48.083]  The whole thing, from every angle, like a 3D model, the creation, the funding, the training, the protection, the funding of the madrasas, the opening of the doors, the blocking the FBI, MI6, MI5 from stopping them, going after activists and journalists that expose them.
[00:34:50.544 --> 00:34:55.026]  You want all hell to break loose, try actually investigating radical jihadis in your country.
[00:34:55.506 --> 00:34:58.287]  The feds come after you instantly.
[00:34:59.548 --> 00:35:07.250]  And they're, we apologize, we don't want to do this, but we even, it's not going to go well if you keep, higher ups have said don't look into this.
[00:35:08.431 --> 00:35:12.412]  And what has come out from the San Bernardino attacks two weeks ago?
[00:35:15.293 --> 00:35:28.377]  The feds were directly on them, they knew where they'd been trained, they knew what they were planning, and they were threatened by the Justice Department and investigated and looked at for being fired and criminal charges.
[00:35:30.657 --> 00:35:32.138]  Two different agents.
[00:35:33.658 --> 00:35:37.500]  With the FBI, several with another DHS agency.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.120]  It's all DHS to begin with.
[00:35:40.081 --> 00:35:48.384]  That was in mainstream news last week and that the FBI was told to get up for the first two days and say there's no terror relation connection.
[00:35:49.504 --> 00:35:54.006]  Until it turned out the FBI went to the President and said we are a laughing stock.
[00:35:55.393 --> 00:36:00.975]  The bombs, the training, the tactical gear, the witnesses.
[00:36:01.935 --> 00:36:04.696]  They pledged allegiance on Facebook to ISIS.
[00:36:05.116 --> 00:36:06.276]  We look like idiots.
[00:36:06.937 --> 00:36:17.220]  And the President was losing all credibility and cratering in the polls, so he had to go on Sunday night and say he was going to respond to it by taking your Second Amendment away.
[00:36:19.192 --> 00:36:20.713]  And that he would defeat ISIS.
[00:36:21.533 --> 00:36:25.754]  And then yesterday comes out in a speech and goes, we will continue the same policies that we had before.
[00:36:26.394 --> 00:36:27.735]  Which is doing nothing.
[00:36:29.976 --> 00:36:32.536]  So I'm going to go over this here in just a moment.
[00:36:33.197 --> 00:36:37.938]  And while all of this is happening, House Republicans are having to propose a resolution defending Christmas.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.820]  Because all over the country,
[00:36:47.247 --> 00:36:51.950]  They're actually telling people in public schools and colleges, you can't have a tree in your dorm.
[00:36:52.271 --> 00:36:53.551]  You can't have one in your room.
[00:36:53.972 --> 00:36:55.693]  You can't even talk about Christmas.
[00:36:55.993 --> 00:36:57.354]  You can't hand out Bibles.
[00:36:57.654 --> 00:36:59.936]  You have no free speech, but everyone else does.
[00:37:00.236 --> 00:37:01.857]  You can't hand out constitutions.
[00:37:01.997 --> 00:37:12.305]  I have seen more than 20 plus colleges in the last year, as I see it every week or so, arrest students that hand out pocket constitutions.
[00:37:16.095 --> 00:37:17.956]  Everybody else is allowed to hand out whatever they want.
[00:37:18.357 --> 00:37:23.380]  If it's seen as Americana or part of the American culture, it is banned.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:27.283]  People go, this is outrageous, it's over the top, it's totalitarian, it's authoritarian.
[00:37:27.583 --> 00:37:28.584]  Why are they doing this?
[00:37:28.604 --> 00:37:29.705]  They're supposed to be liberal.
[00:37:30.145 --> 00:37:33.528]  They're not liberals, they're power-grabbing.
[00:37:34.989 --> 00:37:39.912]  They're taking us a trillion miles, hoping we only battle back 500 billion.
[00:37:41.681 --> 00:37:45.866]  They'll still have us 500 billion miles down a black hole.
[00:37:51.913 --> 00:37:53.836]  They know what they're doing.
[00:37:54.697 --> 00:37:58.582]  They are a scientific military operation.
[00:38:01.786 --> 00:38:11.732]  Putin's come out and said the global warming system is a global military operation to destroy nation states and bankrupt the individual for social engineering, which is exactly what it is.
[00:38:13.973 --> 00:38:17.635]  You are facing a scientific military operation.
[00:38:18.216 --> 00:38:21.077]  If you're unconscious of it, you will be destroyed and enslaved.
[00:38:21.417 --> 00:38:21.918]  Dumb down.
[00:38:23.268 --> 00:38:33.775]  But if you are aware of it and will research it, it's fantastical, it's incredible, you'll be able to defend yourself, you'll be informed, you will accelerate in life, in business, in culture.
[00:38:34.796 --> 00:38:36.617]  The coolest thing to be is awake.
[00:38:37.217 --> 00:38:40.519]  The most powerful thing to be is awake and strong and focused.
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:48.665]  And not a chump, not a schmuck, not an idiot, not a sucker, not a dumbo, not a dodo bird, not a mark.
[00:38:51.305 --> 00:38:54.630]  You see, they engineer people to think it's cool to be chumps.
[00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:56.412]  Well, not me.
[00:38:57.894 --> 00:39:02.280]  And they can sit back on the Young Turks and every other White House connected whorehouse.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:10.426]  And they can sit around with all their little fancy pants, Media Matters and MSNBC and go, Ha ha ha ha!
[00:39:10.827 --> 00:39:12.708]  That kook says the government funds ISIS!
[00:39:12.969 --> 00:39:13.769]  Ha ha ha!
[00:39:14.009 --> 00:39:15.591]  That kook says fluoride's bad for ya!
[00:39:15.811 --> 00:39:16.652]  Ha ha ha!
[00:39:16.972 --> 00:39:18.713]  That guy says breastfeeding's good for babies!
[00:39:18.914 --> 00:39:19.654]  Ha ha ha!
[00:39:19.874 --> 00:39:23.558]  That guy says plastic additives are destroying our sexuality and giving us cancer!
[00:39:23.758 --> 00:39:24.599]  Ha ha ha!
[00:39:27.001 --> 00:39:30.704]  When the informed people out there know, all I'm stating is admitted fact.
[00:39:32.915 --> 00:39:49.944]  One of the big hip-hop websites posted a video where I ran it for just a few minutes about the fake Rick Ross, the fat, fat jail guard that was expert at imprisoning black people, who then goes around acting like a Mac Daddy, you know, up there, an original gangster, which he's not, to make gangster culture look cool.
[00:39:49.984 --> 00:39:51.385]  He's talking about killing Donald Trump.
[00:39:51.785 --> 00:40:01.790]  And they wrote this article, and folks started attacking me, and then the majority of people came in and said, no, what Alex Jones is saying is absolutely true.
[00:40:03.456 --> 00:40:08.220]  And then the response on the big hip-hop site was, by some people, was, oh, he's a racist.
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.381]  Oh yeah, I'm a real racist.
[00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:25.213]  That's why I sit here and talk straight to you and say, you're filled with racism, you're filled with tribal programming from the media, so you're distracted on the enemies that aren't enemies, while the globalists murder you with fluoride, vaccines, and abortion, 51% of black people.
[00:40:27.276 --> 00:40:39.325]  A racist will sit here and teach you to be racially obsessed, teach you to have a chip on your shoulder, teach you to want handouts, teach you how to be a gangster so you can be put in prison, not tell you you're being scientifically murdered.
[00:40:39.625 --> 00:40:52.455]  How pathetic and weak and stupid to sit there at someone literally trying to haul you out of a boiling cauldron and trying to haul everyone else out because there's a little secret.
[00:40:52.875 --> 00:40:53.916]  We're all in this together.
[00:40:54.196 --> 00:40:56.478]  We either haul each other out or we all lose everything.
[00:40:58.422 --> 00:41:11.191]  We're all basically paddling for shore, a hurricane's coming in, we're in a rowboat, and you're bitching about me being a racist when waves are starting to lap into it, and if we don't get to shore, that hurricane's gonna kill us, you idiots!
[00:41:13.272 --> 00:41:15.154]  You like being murdered in your house slow?
[00:41:15.334 --> 00:41:16.294]  You like being killed?
[00:41:16.455 --> 00:41:18.876]  You like the state taking your kids over and brainwashing them?
[00:41:19.597 --> 00:41:23.980]  Then keep watching Melissa Harris Perry, who hates your stinking guts!
[00:41:26.716 --> 00:41:28.757]  She hates my stinking guts as well.
[00:41:29.397 --> 00:41:30.578]  That's what all makes us the same.
[00:41:30.878 --> 00:41:33.059]  We got red blood, stinking guts.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.460]  And where's your heart?
[00:41:36.121 --> 00:41:39.443]  See that big fat parasite Rick Ross drinking your blood?
[00:41:40.383 --> 00:41:40.923]  Sucking you.
[00:41:41.824 --> 00:41:44.185]  Sucking you and your family dry and you can't even see it.
[00:41:44.365 --> 00:41:45.446]  Makes you want to throw up.
[00:41:48.668 --> 00:41:49.468]  Now continuing.
[00:41:57.452 --> 00:42:05.798]  Briefly, you're absolutely guaranteed to get your packages if you order in the next 48 hours.
[00:42:06.598 --> 00:42:10.481]  We have to cut off saying you can get it by noon Friday, basically.
[00:42:11.141 --> 00:42:12.242]  And that's 48 hours.
[00:42:15.444 --> 00:42:16.785]  A little more than 48 hours.

[00:44:03.445 --> 00:44:05.586]  Send a bottle of X2 to your friends and family.
[00:44:05.646 --> 00:44:06.687]  Call them up, tell them how to use it.
[00:44:07.027 --> 00:44:11.730]  Or order it, if it's, you know, the family lives in your town, and give them the presents Christmas Eve.
[00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:16.473]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:44:16.493 --> 00:44:25.258]  And you're not buying the products from some big globalist corporation that then gives the money to anti-gun groups or open border groups or the rest of it.
[00:44:26.792 --> 00:44:34.714]  You are voting with your dollars, voting with your currency to support an organization that's dedicated to viciously expose the New World Order.
[00:44:36.635 --> 00:44:37.655]  To raise the alarm.
[00:44:38.936 --> 00:44:41.136]  To blow the big trumpet on the castle wall.
[00:44:41.396 --> 00:44:43.497]  To light the sentinel fires.
[00:44:44.957 --> 00:44:46.018]  To raise the people.
[00:44:47.438 --> 00:44:53.340]  The modern Paul Revere operation, we are the foremost horseman in the night, riding
[00:44:54.585 --> 00:45:02.690]  Warning the people, letting them know what's happening, and trying to get other people to ride with us, to continue to ride into the land and across the world, warning people.
[00:45:05.192 --> 00:45:24.285]  It's the equivalent of Paul Revere riding five, six hours of the night, his horse is exhausted, sweating all over, and riding into a barn with waiting patriots who take that horse, put a blanket over it, give it water, give it grain, and put Paul Revere on another big horse, so he can ride right back into the night and continue.
[00:45:27.856 --> 00:45:28.416]  On a mission.
[00:45:28.697 --> 00:45:29.117]  Committed.
[00:45:29.957 --> 00:45:32.599]  You are those Paul Reveres of your race, color, and creed.
[00:45:35.241 --> 00:45:36.682]  And it's time for you to take action.
[00:45:37.983 --> 00:45:42.045]  It's time for you to get involved in the InfoWar.
[00:45:42.065 --> 00:45:44.387]  If you haven't, many of you have, and I salute you and thank you.

[00:46:00.007 --> 00:46:01.047]  Hillary for Prison Shirts.
[00:46:01.327 --> 00:46:02.548]  We're not ordering any more of those.
[00:46:02.888 --> 00:46:04.268]  Some sizes have already sold out.
[00:46:05.549 --> 00:46:07.049]  Hillary for Prison Shirts and more.
[00:46:07.129 --> 00:46:09.009]  Infowarsstore.com.

[00:46:16.851 --> 00:46:18.792]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:46:19.832 --> 00:46:20.132]  Okay.
[00:46:21.693 --> 00:46:23.113]  Let's now get back into the news here.
[00:46:25.759 --> 00:46:34.761]  We've already mentioned that all of the LA United School District, arguably the biggest in the country, has been shut down today.
[00:46:34.821 --> 00:46:42.243]  No school, not for ice, not for floods, not for wildfires, but for the terrorism that is not terrorism.
[00:46:44.204 --> 00:46:46.464]  It's an unspecified threat was received.
[00:46:46.844 --> 00:46:49.985]  They're now saying via email, mentioning the show Homeland.
[00:46:53.539 --> 00:46:57.300]  And so whether this is real or not, I mean, they have police all over the place.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.360]  You just have the police on call to go in the school.
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:04.601]  You just station a cruiser outside every school.
[00:47:04.881 --> 00:47:07.341]  One cop's good enough for a couple of jihadis.
[00:47:08.221 --> 00:47:11.562]  I mean, I'm not sitting here saying I'm the toughest guy around, but I've had folks pull guns on me growing up.
[00:47:11.582 --> 00:47:13.982]  I also took them away from them and pistol-whipped them twice.
[00:47:17.323 --> 00:47:18.743]  I'm not even going to tell one of the stories.
[00:47:18.763 --> 00:47:19.943]  I haven't told some of the stuff.
[00:47:19.963 --> 00:47:21.284]  It's just over the top.
[00:47:21.924 --> 00:47:23.144]  But I had a buddy that
[00:47:26.235 --> 00:47:27.095]  I'm not going to get into it.
[00:47:27.115 --> 00:47:36.078]  The point is, believe me, I don't know where America is that they sit around for 30 minutes, an hour, two hours before they go into these schools and take action.
[00:47:36.298 --> 00:47:37.418]  And they've gotten quicker about it.
[00:47:37.678 --> 00:47:42.800]  But I mean, in the old days, the UT shooter was up there shooting for, you know, 30 minutes or so.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:46.661]  Folks went up the tower, a citizen and an Austin cop and killed the guy.
[00:47:48.502 --> 00:47:52.883]  And nowadays, who knows how long somebody be up in a tower like that, a crazy Marine with a giant brain tumor.
[00:47:55.811 --> 00:47:59.093]  And so you shouldn't cancel school, you shouldn't live in panicked fear.
[00:47:59.453 --> 00:48:01.174]  That's exactly what the jihadists want.
[00:48:03.575 --> 00:48:04.196]  But look at this!
[00:48:04.296 --> 00:48:07.838]  Hackers trace ISIS Twitter accounts back to the UK government.
[00:48:09.459 --> 00:48:09.719]  U.S.
[00:48:09.759 --> 00:48:12.820]  visas continue to be handled by foreign contractors.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.482]  Wayne Matson has the story on InfoWars.com.
[00:48:17.123 --> 00:48:19.304]  NATO nations training recruiting jihadists.
[00:48:19.804 --> 00:48:22.826]  Albania and Turkey are supplying fresh troops for Islamic State.
[00:48:24.636 --> 00:48:28.138]  That's another exclusive to M4Wars.com, but it links through to all the mainstream media.
[00:48:28.158 --> 00:48:29.038]  I mean, it's admitted.
[00:48:29.819 --> 00:48:38.983]  Turkish Eman in the USA got $500 million in Texas last year alone of taxpayer money to set up radical training schools.
[00:48:40.024 --> 00:48:45.747]  He's got billions of dollars worldwide
[00:48:47.682 --> 00:48:52.465]  It says $20 billion and just in Texas he gets $500 million a year.
[00:48:52.925 --> 00:48:54.986]  He has $25 billion in assets.
[00:48:56.147 --> 00:48:58.368]  That's a David Knight report on InfoWars.com.
[00:48:58.848 --> 00:49:03.411]  And David Knight and others came to me about two weeks ago and said, hey, we want to go cover this.
[00:49:03.951 --> 00:49:07.974]  By all means, Joe Biggs, David Knight, you know, let's do it.
[00:49:08.774 --> 00:49:10.215]  The media won't cover it, let's cover it.
[00:49:12.585 --> 00:49:17.689]  There's finally lawsuits going on about it, so maybe this will get some media attention to it, but this is big.
[00:49:18.489 --> 00:49:28.096]  And we started on the East Coast at the different radical training centers, but now Texas is obviously in the news with $500 million a year in taxpayer money.
[00:49:29.605 --> 00:49:31.446]  You know how much taxpayer money InfoWars gets?
[00:49:31.906 --> 00:49:32.386]  Zero.
[00:49:32.806 --> 00:49:33.326]  Zero.
[00:49:33.687 --> 00:49:34.187]  Zero.
[00:49:34.547 --> 00:49:34.987]  Zero.
[00:49:35.387 --> 00:49:35.807]  Zero.
[00:49:36.188 --> 00:49:36.608]  Zero.
[00:49:36.968 --> 00:49:37.408]  Zero.
[00:49:37.748 --> 00:49:38.168]  Zero.
[00:49:38.769 --> 00:49:40.269]  And you know how much the jihadis get?
[00:49:40.449 --> 00:49:42.430]  Billions and billions and billions and billions.
[00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:47.492]  You know how many mosques Saudi Arabia opens a year in Europe?
[00:49:47.992 --> 00:49:48.632]  Over a hundred.
[00:49:48.933 --> 00:49:57.436]  And now they've announced an acceleration to 200 mosques a year, exporting their poorest and most radical to Europe.
[00:49:58.322 --> 00:50:01.304]  With a deal with Merkel and the rest of these people.
[00:50:03.826 --> 00:50:05.107]  And now they're building mosques here.
[00:50:05.808 --> 00:50:11.272]  And again, they're not exporting nice friendly Muslims that I've known, that are moderates, that their daughters have freedom.
[00:50:12.233 --> 00:50:24.222]  They're exporting basically the equivalent of, I don't want to be mean to rednecks, but these are like hillbilly radical Muslims that are the worst of the worst.
[00:50:27.096 --> 00:50:33.300]  I mean, I love how the liberals shoot their mouth all day about country people being racist or bad or backwards when they're some of the most hard-working, smart people out there.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.021]  Meanwhile, you talk about backward.
[00:50:35.701 --> 00:50:45.747]  Don't let their women come out of the house, basically chain them up, and feminists just think it is the sexiest thing since... since armpir... I mean, armpit hair.
[00:50:46.627 --> 00:50:48.048]  Braiding their beautiful armpit hair.
[00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:56.775]  They just can't wait to have a burka put on their head and I guess you mean back slap to have their teeth knocked out a little bit.
[00:50:57.056 --> 00:50:57.636]  Black eye.
[00:50:57.656 --> 00:50:59.738]  They're like, oh, it's so liberal.
[00:50:59.758 --> 00:51:01.419]  Oh, but you see that other guy?
[00:51:01.459 --> 00:51:02.420]  He was wearing pants.
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:03.001]  Yeah.
[00:51:03.561 --> 00:51:04.542]  Yeah, man.
[00:51:04.642 --> 00:51:05.603]  Western men.
[00:51:07.064 --> 00:51:08.665]  I deserve everything for free.
[00:51:09.186 --> 00:51:10.226]  I like the radicals though.
[00:51:10.246 --> 00:51:11.167]  Are you prepared to bug out?
[00:51:11.387 --> 00:51:19.114]  Infidel Body Armor and an Army Ranger have produced a high-speed DVD and book to show you how to drive in combat, patrol, and how to survive in combat.
[00:51:19.394 --> 00:51:19.654]  I think so.

[00:52:39.235 --> 00:52:41.977]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:52:42.297 --> 00:52:44.898]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:52:44.918 --> 00:52:45.358]  Croix River.
[00:52:45.658 --> 00:52:46.319]  I loved my dad.
[00:52:46.719 --> 00:52:47.680]  The boy was too stubborn.
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:50.621]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:52:50.861 --> 00:52:51.382]  His excuse?
[00:52:51.742 --> 00:52:52.802]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:52:53.082 --> 00:52:54.363]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:52:54.683 --> 00:53:00.186]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[00:53:39.062 --> 00:53:48.385]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day, but growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.
[00:53:48.485 --> 00:53:52.787]  The solution is DefenderShield, the most effective mobile radiation shielding ever developed.

[00:54:25.458 --> 00:54:34.842]  When I start ranting, it's because I can't believe that our government's been hijacked by criminals, the UK government, the EU governments, NATO.
[00:54:36.382 --> 00:54:48.747]  Our own top generals, like four of them now, have come out and said, we run Al-Qaeda, we were ordered to run Al-Qaeda, ISIS is Al-Qaeda, 95% of the rebels are Al-Qaeda, they're basically all bad, this is evil, we don't want to be part of it.
[00:54:49.887 --> 00:54:50.828]  And then nothing happens.
[00:54:52.168 --> 00:54:53.669]  There is an Inspector General
[00:54:54.881 --> 00:54:58.204]  of the Pentagon investigation now, so I guess something is happening.
[00:54:59.985 --> 00:55:01.406]  But it's cut and dry.
[00:55:01.867 --> 00:55:06.090]  Congress should be impeaching Hillary and Obama right now.
[00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.951]  Here's the problem.
[00:55:08.352 --> 00:55:12.956]  Lindsey Graham and people like John McCain
[00:55:14.748 --> 00:55:23.592]  Are both involved heavily with other Republicans in cheerleading just as bad as Obama and Hillary for arming and controlling ISIS.
[00:55:23.972 --> 00:55:25.653]  The difference is they didn't actually direct it.
[00:55:25.993 --> 00:55:26.834]  They're still guilty, though.
[00:55:28.314 --> 00:55:33.577]  Ted Cruz, you know, two years ago said we shouldn't be Al Qaeda's air force in Syria, but he's still backstopping Assad.
[00:55:33.857 --> 00:55:34.978]  He's hedging his bet.
[00:55:35.998 --> 00:55:39.119]  And that's the one big problem I have with him because he's really smart.
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:40.820]  Smarter than I am, probably.
[00:55:41.621 --> 00:55:44.082]  Probably one of the smartest guys when it comes to politics.
[00:55:45.273 --> 00:55:48.814]  One of the most informed, and he knows well what he's doing.
[00:55:49.474 --> 00:55:50.935]  Big strike against Ted Cruz.
[00:55:52.455 --> 00:55:53.636]  And I admire Ted Cruz.
[00:55:54.716 --> 00:55:57.677]  Big strike against Donald Trump that he says, I'll shut down parts of the internet.
[00:55:57.917 --> 00:55:59.158]  That's dangerous talk, Donald.
[00:55:59.258 --> 00:56:00.098]  I still like him.
[00:56:02.679 --> 00:56:10.521]  But as much as I have problems with those two guys, or Rand Paul, acting all, you know, limp-wristed, basically.
[00:56:12.062 --> 00:56:13.382]  I say that trying to get him going.
[00:56:13.643 --> 00:56:14.463]  It's tough love.
[00:56:15.421 --> 00:56:19.303]  They're light years better than Bernie, Hillary, Jeb.
[00:56:19.323 --> 00:56:20.384]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:56:20.824 --> 00:56:22.565]  The debate's tonight, 7 o'clock.
[00:56:22.625 --> 00:56:24.246]  Live coverage, InfoWars.com.
[00:56:24.586 --> 00:56:26.247]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:56:26.287 --> 00:56:26.988]  Have the live feed.
[00:56:29.189 --> 00:56:31.550]  InfoWars.com forward slash 2016.
[00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:32.471]  Let's make that a link.
[00:56:32.631 --> 00:56:34.692]  InfoWars.com forward slash 2016.
[00:56:35.152 --> 00:56:36.273]  That isn't a URL yet.
[00:56:36.533 --> 00:56:37.454]  It will be in five minutes.
[00:56:37.754 --> 00:56:38.674]  That's the link to share.
[00:56:38.694 --> 00:56:39.455]  We'll tweet that out.
[00:56:40.902 --> 00:56:47.709]  And please help us retweet it, and I'm going to do a bunch of Facebook mentions tonight, galvanizing folks to come in and watch our live coverage.
[00:56:49.711 --> 00:56:55.958]  Now, I don't have time to get to these during this break, but I have Trey Gowdy, Grills DHS official on due process.
[00:56:56.358 --> 00:57:00.202]  Obama's Undersecretary of the Army nominee says ISIS is not contained.
[00:57:00.263 --> 00:57:01.143]  Obama says it is.
[00:57:02.332 --> 00:57:07.815]  North Carolina Governor, the feds don't tell us where, when, or who we're bringing in the refugees.
[00:57:08.035 --> 00:57:09.216]  Let's play that one first.
[00:57:10.016 --> 00:57:17.400]  This is North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory appearing on Fox News to discuss some other topics, sanctuary cities, and Syrian refugees.
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:23.824]  Now remember, they're going to track everything you do, spy on you, put you on no-fly list as a citizen with no evidence, no proof.
[00:57:25.545 --> 00:57:28.827]  Just to jack with you and set the precedent for extrajudicial control.
[00:57:29.087 --> 00:57:31.008]  The IRS now has gotten the law passed.
[00:57:31.903 --> 00:57:35.364]  Uh, where they're gonna not let you fly if you haven't paid your income taxes.
[00:57:36.164 --> 00:57:38.665]  But no judge, no jury, they just claim there's a problem.
[00:57:39.245 --> 00:57:43.107]  This is internal checkpoints, the essence of a tyranny.
[00:57:43.167 --> 00:57:47.348]  I mean, that is the most signified, bonafide, one symbol.
[00:57:47.688 --> 00:57:55.331]  You gotta say one thing, not being able to travel when you haven't been indicted or on parole, I mean, baby, that's the big daddy.
[00:57:55.571 --> 00:57:58.632]  That's the Godzilla of, uh, Japanese monsters.
[00:57:59.312 --> 00:58:00.813]  I mean, it's the big kahuna.
[00:58:01.173 --> 00:58:02.493]  It's the big red flag.
[00:58:02.874 --> 00:58:04.514]  It's the... it's bad.
[00:58:04.915 --> 00:58:06.575]  Papers and an internal passport.
[00:58:07.796 --> 00:58:09.477]  Yeah, and restrictions.
[00:58:09.897 --> 00:58:11.277]  You want it, you got it.
[00:58:11.698 --> 00:58:14.159]  Any form of slavery you want, it all starts there.
[00:58:14.599 --> 00:58:20.682]  And here they are saying they won't tell us who these people are and they just disappear because security's all a fraud.
[00:58:20.742 --> 00:58:22.963]  Our government is run by the terrorists.
[00:58:22.983 --> 00:58:23.523]  Let's play the clip.
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:28.623]  You have Syrian refugees headed to North Carolina.
[00:58:28.663 --> 00:58:30.605]  You oppose that, but you can't stop it, correct?
[00:58:31.656 --> 00:58:32.156]  That's correct.
[00:58:32.176 --> 00:58:33.737]  We're not even told by the president.
[00:58:33.777 --> 00:58:40.161]  I think the most misinformation is that the federal government and Homeland Security and the president tell each governor.
[00:58:40.561 --> 00:58:45.064]  When these Syrian refugees come to our state, we have no communication whatsoever.
[00:58:45.084 --> 00:58:45.564]  Yeah, you don't know.
[00:58:45.604 --> 00:58:47.705]  When they come, where they go, who they are.
[00:58:47.725 --> 00:58:48.206]  We'll be back.
[00:58:48.246 --> 00:58:48.526]  We'll be back.
[00:58:48.566 --> 00:58:49.246]  It's all a fraud.
[00:58:49.286 --> 00:58:49.987]  It's all a scam.
[00:58:50.507 --> 00:58:52.128]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:52.168 --> 00:58:54.029]  The terrorists are getting ready to hit us.
[00:58:54.049 --> 00:58:55.250]  And they're going to take all our rights.
[00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:57.351]  The terrorists run the White House.
[00:58:59.778 --> 00:59:03.001]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:59:03.281 --> 00:59:11.308]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:11.548 --> 00:59:16.552]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:59:16.952 --> 00:59:19.254]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:19.495 --> 00:59:21.276]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:59:29.719 --> 00:59:30.619]  BrainForce is here.
[00:59:30.819 --> 00:59:32.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:37.742]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:59:38.022 --> 00:59:41.203]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:59:41.303 --> 00:59:44.524]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:59:44.784 --> 00:59:46.585]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:59:46.765 --> 00:59:50.766]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.
[00:59:50.886 --> 00:59:56.468]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:05.131]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.551 --> 01:00:23.357]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:23.957 --> 01:00:30.279]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:42.552 --> 01:00:44.753]  You walk into this room at your own risk.
[01:00:45.533 --> 01:00:46.914]  Because it leads to the future.
[01:00:47.674 --> 01:00:49.975]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[01:00:51.136 --> 01:00:52.016]  This is not a new world.
[01:00:53.365 --> 01:00:56.646]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[01:00:57.767 --> 01:01:05.270]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:13.133]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[01:01:14.274 --> 01:01:18.875]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[01:01:19.996 --> 01:01:22.217]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[01:01:27.575 --> 01:01:29.417]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[01:01:30.298 --> 01:01:35.963]  In his last 48 hours on Earth, he's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[01:01:36.984 --> 01:01:38.525]  Because he's built out of flesh.
[01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:40.547]  And because he has a mind.
[01:01:41.748 --> 01:01:46.432]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[01:01:48.234 --> 01:01:50.116]  More like the Globalist Obama Zone.
[01:01:52.467 --> 01:01:54.008]  InfoWars.com.
[01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:56.310]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:59.352]  Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
[01:02:00.593 --> 01:02:13.683]  I'll be honest with you, all the Christmas worship, the obsession with it, I never disliked it, but I didn't like the crowds, the traffic, I like the lights, I like some of the presents when I was a kid, but overall I like Thanksgiving better.
[01:02:13.804 --> 01:02:14.564]  I just like family.
[01:02:14.884 --> 01:02:15.805]  I like Christmas food.
[01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:16.726]  I like holiday food.
[01:02:17.126 --> 01:02:18.968]  I like pumpkin pie and cherry pie.
[01:02:19.667 --> 01:02:19.827]  I don't
[01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.331]  And the filthy scum!
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:57.202]  That have taken this country over and Europe over are banning Christmas carols in Italy.
[01:02:57.763 --> 01:02:58.883]  They're banning it in Germany.
[01:02:59.564 --> 01:03:00.685]  They're telling women how to dress.
[01:03:00.705 --> 01:03:08.269]  They're telling people you can't have Oktoberfest outside because, you know, there's 10,000 migrants in the town of 5,000 now and they come up and say you're not going to drink that beer.
[01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:17.876]  I mean, it's crazy to have these arrogant, stuck-up, crazy people who come from these henpecked countries where they just suppress each other all day and make each other conform.
[01:03:17.896 --> 01:03:20.858]  Then they come to our truly liberal cultures
[01:03:21.718 --> 01:03:26.985]  And a bunch of fake liberals team up with him to tell us what words to use and how to talk and how to behave.
[01:03:27.265 --> 01:03:28.126]  I'm sick of it!
[01:03:28.547 --> 01:03:29.448]  I'm tired of it!
[01:03:29.768 --> 01:03:30.549]  I'm getting angry.
[01:03:31.911 --> 01:03:35.215]  Let some jackass tell me to not have a Christmas tree in my yard or whatever.
[01:03:35.435 --> 01:03:37.037]  I'm gonna break your frickin' nose.
[01:03:37.738 --> 01:03:40.061]  I'm tired of getting pushed around and I've had enough.
[01:03:41.311 --> 01:03:47.874]  I'm not trying to act tough, I just have to vent sometimes because I sit here and I look at all this and our government funding Al-Qaeda and murdering everybody.
[01:03:47.894 --> 01:03:51.595]  I mean, just think of the trash that we have running our country.
[01:03:53.016 --> 01:03:59.219]  That they would go into stable countries and put crazies in to murder all the Christians, much less Muslims, who I care about as well.
[01:04:00.899 --> 01:04:05.261]  They're targeting countries that have got Christians and that are somewhat secular and stable.
[01:04:05.601 --> 01:04:22.770]  And they are murdering everyone they get their filthy hands on with our sickening evil Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and Hollande and Merkel and Cameron, honchoing the whole stinking mess from London, funding and running.
[01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:28.253]  It came out that ISIS is, in fact, it isn't enough to show one article, it's enough to show a whole spectrum.
[01:04:29.738 --> 01:04:41.824]  Do you remember a month ago it came out that all the major ISIS video and website accounts are run by government-connected secretive telecoms in Silicon Valley?
[01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:43.185]  Oh!
[01:04:43.605 --> 01:04:48.648]  And now it's in mainstream news that the hackers have traced ISIS Twitter accounts to the British government?
[01:04:49.248 --> 01:04:49.348]  Oh!
[01:04:49.928 --> 01:04:51.609]  You know they let them fly wherever they want?
[01:04:51.629 --> 01:04:52.490]  You know they bring them in?
[01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:53.650]  You know they protect them?
[01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:54.651]  You know they run them?
[01:04:56.775 --> 01:05:03.140]  And then if you dare protest them in England, they arrest you and throw you in a pen with them to be beaten or murdered.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:08.585]  They even let, in England, they let them get away with pouring acid on women's faces and raping children.
[01:05:10.171 --> 01:05:19.514]  The LAPD and private security are targeting random people with stop and frisk searches on public sidewalks before the premiere of Star Wars The Force Awakens.
[01:05:19.794 --> 01:05:26.436]  Police have also installed metal detectors on the sidewalks near the famous TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood, California.
[01:05:26.996 --> 01:05:30.858]  Someone took to Twitter to post a picture of a Wookiee having his bag searched.
[01:05:31.078 --> 01:05:35.699]  The caption reads, security will be tight for the latest hashtag Star Wars premiere tonight.
[01:05:35.959 --> 01:05:37.540]  Metal detectors have been set up.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:48.887]  TMZ reported, LAPD and private security officers are already blanketing several square blocks around the famed Chinese theater where the Force Awakens event is going down.
[01:05:49.227 --> 01:05:54.990]  We've learned anyone strolling through the area could be searched, frisked, and even wanted with metal detectors.
[01:05:55.391 --> 01:06:02.775]  In other words, even people not associated with the event who are simply passing through a public area are subject to a warrantless search.
[01:06:03.336 --> 01:06:06.878]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[01:08:20.051 --> 01:08:22.192]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:08:22.732 --> 01:08:27.875]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:08:28.455 --> 01:08:34.639]  I want you.
[01:08:40.544 --> 01:08:42.525]  Well, the big battle's coming up tonight.
[01:08:42.565 --> 01:08:48.528]  We'll have live coverage on InfoWars Nightly News for at least three hours, seven o'clock Central Standard Time.
[01:08:49.088 --> 01:08:51.969]  InfoWarsNews.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:53.570 --> 01:09:06.334]  And of course, you'll be able to watch the free feeds, audio and video at InfoWars.com forward slash 2016 is the link for election coverage and the free feeds.
[01:09:06.754 --> 01:09:08.695]  Also InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:09:09.055 --> 01:09:15.717]  We'll also have both the daytime feed, refeeding of the radio slash TV show InfoWars Live with yours truly Alex Jones.
[01:09:16.657 --> 01:09:22.678]  Jakari Jackson hosting the fourth hour today and we will continue on with the Sunday show 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:09:22.718 --> 01:09:24.538]  Central as well.
[01:09:24.979 --> 01:09:30.360]  Watch coverage of the last 2015 Republican debate here at InfoWars.com tonight at 7.
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.740]  InfoWars exclusive coverage of the GOP debate.
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:35.460]  And some people send us emails.
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:36.281]  It's very popular.
[01:09:36.801 --> 01:09:39.141]  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands just on the streams watch.
[01:09:40.201 --> 01:09:41.802]  One time we had like 500,000 watched.
[01:09:41.922 --> 01:09:42.902]  On average it's about 300,000.
[01:09:44.522 --> 01:09:46.104]  Watch it live and then the refeed of it.
[01:09:47.585 --> 01:09:50.849]  We actually get a lot of emails though saying, hey, stop talking over the debate.
[01:09:52.851 --> 01:09:58.177]  You tune in to CNN to see the debate and to see their commercials and to see them cutting in.
[01:09:58.617 --> 01:10:00.780]  This is a presidential supposed commission.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.622]  It's only being hosted by them.
[01:10:03.022 --> 01:10:05.605]  We are covering the debate and the horror media.
[01:10:06.547 --> 01:10:08.188]  We are covering the media event.
[01:10:08.248 --> 01:10:10.530]  That's how we take the feed and cover it.
[01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:13.493]  We could not just take their feed and have that there.
[01:10:14.113 --> 01:10:16.975]  We are adding our commentary, adding our own news pieces.
[01:10:17.376 --> 01:10:23.100]  We are analyzing it, just like I can show presidential commercials or I can analyze clips of films.
[01:10:24.661 --> 01:10:27.163]  Under classical fair use has been checked out by the lawyers.
[01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:28.164]  It's very defensible.
[01:10:28.424 --> 01:10:29.385]  That's what we're doing.
[01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:31.267]  I just keep explaining it and people don't get it.
[01:10:31.487 --> 01:10:33.889]  So I don't want our crew to even explain that anymore tonight.
[01:10:34.534 --> 01:10:50.428]  When people send tweets or emails, because I think it's kind of a joke when they ask it, I think we'll say it maybe once at the start and maybe at the ending, that we're here live analysis of the propaganda and of the candidates and of the controlled media because they cannot be trusted.
[01:10:51.701 --> 01:10:58.327]  We're going to be there adding live analysis and coverage, kind of like Archie Bunker does at his house, you know, yelling at the television.
[01:10:59.007 --> 01:10:59.728]  That's what we're doing.
[01:11:00.248 --> 01:11:04.993]  We are here to expose things in live time in an irreverent way.
[01:11:06.053 --> 01:11:06.834]  And that's what we do.
[01:11:07.174 --> 01:11:14.161]  Now, I want to take phone calls ahead of the former head of the Visa Department in Saudi Arabia, Michael Springman, worked for the State Department.
[01:11:15.137 --> 01:11:19.023]  It came out that the CIA was handling the hijackers, 15 of the 19.
[01:11:19.283 --> 01:11:20.585]  They were ordered to let them back in.
[01:11:20.866 --> 01:11:27.035]  That ties into all the things happening with the visas today and how they're letting these jihadists into the country.
[01:11:28.533 --> 01:11:47.598]  I'd love to hear if people from Customs or Retired Customs or Border Patrol could get in to talk about this, because I know they're good people on average, some of the best, but they are ordered to harass citizens, but you see it all the time where a bus load or a train load of illegals comes in from all over the world, they're ordered to not even look at their IDs or ask for them, and they let them in.
[01:11:47.618 --> 01:11:56.340]  A good example of what came out in the news two weeks ago, 140 plus people from Mexico and other countries out of Mexico landing at JFK.
[01:11:57.435 --> 01:12:02.198]  And they were told, don't even look at their passports or IDs, just let them in and let them out.
[01:12:02.438 --> 01:12:08.382]  And I played a governor earlier, let's play that clip again, of North Carolina on O'Reilly Factor.
[01:12:08.962 --> 01:12:13.205]  The feds don't tell us where, when, or who they're bringing refugees in.
[01:12:13.525 --> 01:12:16.366]  Well, the governor of Texas asked and was told, we're not going to tell you.
[01:12:17.507 --> 01:12:20.309]  Well, we know there's 300 at one high school alone in Austin.
[01:12:21.854 --> 01:12:25.236]  Jakari Jackson went out and covered that at my alma mater, Anderson High.
[01:12:25.256 --> 01:12:26.056]  So here's that clip.
[01:12:26.076 --> 01:12:27.877]  But first, the toll-free number to join us.
[01:12:29.117 --> 01:12:31.438]  First-time callers, again, 800-259-9231, or if you haven't called in a year.
[01:12:31.539 --> 01:12:33.259]  First time or hadn't called in a year.
[01:12:33.279 --> 01:12:34.520]  I think that's a nice in-between level.
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:34.580]  800-259-9231.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:34.640]  800-259-9231.
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:37.361]  Now let's go ahead and go to the North Carolina governor talking about the situation.
[01:12:50.481 --> 01:12:53.367]  You have Syrian refugees headed to North Carolina.
[01:12:53.388 --> 01:12:55.352]  You oppose that, but you can't stop it, correct?
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:56.880]  That's correct.
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:58.461]  We're not even told by the President.
[01:12:58.501 --> 01:13:07.305]  I think the most misinformation is that the federal government and Homeland Security and the President tell each governor when these Syrian refugees come to our state.
[01:13:07.365 --> 01:13:12.507]  We have no communication whatsoever on when they come, where they go, who they are.
[01:13:13.007 --> 01:13:15.108]  And that's what our major objection is.
[01:13:15.388 --> 01:13:24.252]  Our local Homeland Security people, who are the ones that have to respond to any emergency, are not in the communication loop with the President of the United States.
[01:13:24.272 --> 01:13:25.132]  And that's got to change.
[01:13:26.457 --> 01:13:35.080]  And now we have California schools in L.A., the biggest school district in the country, shut down for an unspecified threat.
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:36.521]  And New York's looking at shutting down.
[01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:40.822]  Instead of snow days, we have terror days where we learn to get in a fetal position.
[01:13:43.603 --> 01:13:44.444]  Pretty disgusting.
[01:13:44.484 --> 01:13:46.845]  Nathaniel in Alaska, you're on the air.
[01:13:46.925 --> 01:13:47.245]  Welcome.
[01:13:50.966 --> 01:13:51.887]  This is Nathaniel from Alaska.
[01:13:51.907 --> 01:13:53.287]  I have a few things to talk about today.
[01:13:53.587 --> 01:13:53.867]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:53.887 --> 01:13:54.768]  We're not screening your call.
[01:13:54.828 --> 01:13:55.408]  You're live on air.
[01:13:57.495 --> 01:13:58.515]  Okay, fantastic.
[01:13:59.316 --> 01:14:03.978]  So the first thing I have to say is about the coming geopolitical alignment that I perceive coming.
[01:14:03.998 --> 01:14:08.700]  You were talking earlier about Mustafa Gulen and his Net Movement a little bit, I believe?
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:09.660]  Go ahead.
[01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:14.962]  Okay, so I have a couple ideas as to what will happen.
[01:14:15.583 --> 01:14:24.666]  I perceive that we may very well have a Trump presidency, and I'm very happy about that, but I think it may bring upon certain problems.
[01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:25.667]  But, like you,
[01:14:26.753 --> 01:14:34.080]  I am here to fight simply for what is right, and I'd rather go down with the ship if we're fighting for what is right.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:48.652]  So, what I think will happen is we'll have a Trump presidency, we'll have global backlash from a lot of Islamic entities from around, and they'll be looking for a solution.
[01:14:48.672 --> 01:14:51.655]  That solution will be a secular Islam.
[01:14:51.675 --> 01:14:52.456]  A secular Islam
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:56.361]  Will not be found under the current ISIS situation.
[01:14:56.381 --> 01:14:57.842]  I think it's a huge false flag.
[01:14:57.862 --> 01:15:05.145]  I think the whole ISIS thing is meant to bring in this Hizmet philosophy.
[01:15:05.285 --> 01:15:12.248]  Because if you look at the philosophy, everything on this philosophy essentially points to a solution.
[01:15:13.028 --> 01:15:16.850]  I think the solution may bring upon possibly some
[01:15:20.367 --> 01:15:21.108]  Huge implications.
[01:15:21.268 --> 01:15:22.309]  I appreciate your call.
[01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:30.396]  The reason the West is bringing in radical, incompatible jihadis is because they're going to let them carry out terror attacks.
[01:15:31.036 --> 01:15:38.423]  They're then going to take all of our basic rights and put troops on the street corner for the gun owners, the veterans, the patriots, who they admit it's all for.
[01:15:39.431 --> 01:15:54.535]  They will then false flag terror attack and blame it on us and try to come basically arrest the leadership of the patriot movement that are the true Americans who just want basic Americana, July 4th, free market, private property, the right to keep and bear arms, the right to not be surveilled.
[01:15:54.795 --> 01:15:55.435]  We are the enemy.
[01:15:56.715 --> 01:15:59.216]  But they have to overthrow logic to get that done.
[01:15:59.896 --> 01:16:07.538]  They have to let terrorists get into the country, they have to let them attack us, and then let the very people that aided them pose as our saviors, our owners, our controllers.
[01:16:09.278 --> 01:16:17.545]  So we're here to expose that right now, and we're in a race against time to wake people up, especially at the state level, so the globalists can't carry this out.
[01:16:20.648 --> 01:16:30.456]  They're then in phase two, which Europe is already in, putting them under civil emergencies, banning any libertarian or conservative movements from even demonstrating or holding office.
[01:16:31.917 --> 01:16:36.141]  To then, quote, submit to Islam so that it won't attack us.
[01:16:37.642 --> 01:16:39.383]  And then they won't really submit to Islam.
[01:16:39.743 --> 01:16:48.447]  Once a country submits, they will then round up the more radical jihadis and actually deport them, or imprison them, or rehabilitate them, so there aren't terror attacks.
[01:16:49.867 --> 01:16:53.629]  But anytime you then don't submit, they flip the switch and then turn the jihadis loose.
[01:16:54.189 --> 01:16:58.932]  So, the jihadis are like a big pit bull that they use to menace the West.
[01:16:59.832 --> 01:17:04.094]  And you can see the chain in the hand of the globalists, right down to the neck, the spiked collar.
[01:17:05.307 --> 01:17:09.790]  You see the globalists feeding the pit bull, you know, gunpowder, so it's crazed and out of control?
[01:17:09.810 --> 01:17:15.074]  And they think we're so dumb we don't see this whole situation, even though it's in the news today.
[01:17:16.074 --> 01:17:17.835]  Eric in West Virginia, you're on the air.
[01:17:17.915 --> 01:17:18.276]  Go ahead.
[01:17:19.256 --> 01:17:19.957]  Hi, Alex.
[01:17:20.417 --> 01:17:21.958]  Big, long-time listener.
[01:17:22.478 --> 01:17:25.961]  I met you at Bilderberg 2012 in Chantilly, Virginia.
[01:17:26.481 --> 01:17:33.666]  About the GOP debate tonight, I was thinking, you know, I mean, considering InfoWars has such a huge audience
[01:17:34.307 --> 01:17:43.399]  Just to show off all these other networks and their fake dog and pony show debates, how about InfoWars host your own debate?
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:45.461]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:17:46.502 --> 01:17:48.824]  We do have 20 million viewers and listeners a week.
[01:17:49.244 --> 01:17:50.965]  We do have millions and millions of viewers a day.
[01:17:52.486 --> 01:17:58.331]  But most of the Republican candidates still go along with the establishment and would not probably come on this show.
[01:17:58.711 --> 01:18:00.853]  I could twist Rand Paul's arm, get him on as a guest.
[01:18:01.233 --> 01:18:03.635]  I could twist Ted Cruz's arm, probably get him on if I wanted to.
[01:18:04.455 --> 01:18:06.177]  The Trump people pretty much reached out to us.
[01:18:06.977 --> 01:18:13.399]  I wasn't even shooting that high, thinking to try to get somebody that big on, because quite frankly, it doesn't really even do that much for the show.
[01:18:13.779 --> 01:18:15.460]  I can just analyze what they're doing anyways.
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:22.202]  But it is good that Trump comes on, because it shows how big this audience is, and that he's a savvy guy and knows what he's doing.
[01:18:23.143 --> 01:18:28.124]  But down the road, I mean, I would imagine that we will have some debates of an InfoWars host.
[01:18:28.164 --> 01:18:29.085]  I appreciate your call.
[01:18:29.605 --> 01:18:32.506]  Brandon in a FEMA region.
[01:18:32.526 --> 01:18:33.686]  He won't say what state he's in.
[01:18:34.366 --> 01:18:35.007]  You're on the air.
[01:18:35.027 --> 01:18:35.647]  Go ahead, Brandon.
[01:18:37.202 --> 01:18:43.006]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to start out by saying the good news is we're winning on many fronts.
[01:18:43.066 --> 01:18:48.629]  I'm a college student and the average female I talk to are bitterly opposed to abortion.
[01:18:48.669 --> 01:18:50.850]  Know that global warming is a total fraud.
[01:18:51.371 --> 01:18:53.892]  Know that the police state is a total hoax.
[01:18:53.952 --> 01:19:02.658]  But what I wanted to talk to you today about is, I was reading this morning that Delta Force carried out a raid against ISIS and I wanted to get your opinion.
[01:19:03.286 --> 01:19:07.475]  It's just a staged raid like the Osama Bin Laden raid was, or if it was real.
[01:19:07.795 --> 01:19:10.461]  They claim that they killed a high-ranking ISIS member.
[01:19:10.661 --> 01:19:11.062]  Sure, sure.
[01:19:11.102 --> 01:19:13.647]  Is that the one a month ago where one of the Delta Force guys got killed?
[01:19:14.887 --> 01:19:23.729]  No, no, it was posted this morning and it said that they killed a higher-tier commander in ISIS or something, and they killed 12 jihadis.
[01:19:23.829 --> 01:19:26.930]  Well, there's so many splinter groups in what ISIS is supposedly.
[01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:28.530]  They're all Wahhabis, all the same group.
[01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:30.210]  And I didn't see that new report.
[01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:31.071]  Maybe they'll bring it in to me.
[01:19:31.911 --> 01:19:34.291]  But Delta Force goes and kills who they're told to kill.
[01:19:34.751 --> 01:19:38.712]  And so who knows if who they killed is actually Wahhabis or ISIS.
[01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:41.353]  Delta Force is also very political.
[01:19:42.333 --> 01:19:46.255]  And particularly nowadays, it will engage in any deception the president wants.
[01:19:46.295 --> 01:19:47.616]  They work for the president directly.
[01:19:48.176 --> 01:19:51.858]  So it's not Delta Force, it's Obama Force right now.
[01:19:52.378 --> 01:19:55.200]  And so, quite frankly, I don't trust a word that comes out of their mouths.
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:04.365]  I'm not saying the men that are in Delta Force are bad, but it's just over-the-top political, so I don't believe a word of it.
[01:20:04.885 --> 01:20:08.147]  I mean, look, the point is our government created ISIS and is running it.
[01:20:10.051 --> 01:20:12.933]  Still wondering what to get that special someone that has everything?
[01:20:13.173 --> 01:20:22.960]  At ID Stronghold, we still find that a huge percentage of people do not yet have an RFID blocking wallet or purse to protect them from the new and growing threat of electronic pickpocketing.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:23.780]  That's right.
[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:36.669]  Even though 40% of all new chipped payment cards shipped in 2014 contain a wireless interface called RFID that allows the account information to be skimmed by a thief passing near your cards, most people are still unprotected.

[01:24:34.448 --> 01:24:35.328]  Everything is evil.

[01:24:37.909 --> 01:24:41.171]  That ties into Star Wars, Class Wars.
[01:24:41.631 --> 01:24:45.812]  Is Mars the escape hatch for the 1%?
[01:24:47.553 --> 01:24:48.834]  The escape hatch for the 1%.
[01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:52.931]  Well, the elite are acting like the planet isn't going to be here soon.
[01:24:53.212 --> 01:24:57.934]  Whether that's true or not, it says a lot about what they think about us, doesn't it?
[01:24:58.814 --> 01:25:02.336]  Right now, though, let's go to Seth in Pennsylvania, James in Canada, and others.
[01:25:02.817 --> 01:25:04.617]  Seth in PA, you're on the air.
[01:25:05.958 --> 01:25:06.759]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:25:06.879 --> 01:25:07.379]  Good, my friend.
[01:25:07.399 --> 01:25:09.620]  Well, thanks for having me.
[01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:10.681]  I'm a big fan of the show.
[01:25:10.761 --> 01:25:12.441]  I listen and read all the time.
[01:25:13.062 --> 01:25:13.322]  Thank you.
[01:25:14.574 --> 01:25:17.155]  I just have two things.
[01:25:17.195 --> 01:25:20.615]  The one's a question I wanted to get your take on.
[01:25:20.635 --> 01:25:29.597]  What are your thoughts on the three Senators, Brad Wenstrup, Ken Calvert, and Mike Pompeo?
[01:25:29.617 --> 01:25:41.440]  Do you think anything's going to come out of the investigation of them looking into CENTCOM of Obama doctrine, the record saying that they were containing ISIS and all that?
[01:25:42.093 --> 01:25:48.881]  You know, I'm glad you raised that because there was a headline in an article at Infowars.com yesterday.
[01:25:51.656 --> 01:26:00.721]  That dealt with the fact that there is a Pentagon Inspector General investigation of the fixed intelligence to say that ISIS wasn't a threat.
[01:26:01.201 --> 01:26:03.942]  But the media is spinning it that the investigation is about that.
[01:26:04.002 --> 01:26:06.724]  It's really about the government arming ISIS.
[01:26:07.284 --> 01:26:09.265]  And that's what these generals have come out and talked about.
[01:26:09.365 --> 01:26:12.166]  So yes, we need to really focus on this.
[01:26:12.226 --> 01:26:12.647]  This is
[01:26:14.022 --> 01:26:19.067]  Potentially a thousand times worse than Watergate or even Whitewater.
[01:26:19.547 --> 01:26:21.849]  You know, ripping off some properties.
[01:26:21.949 --> 01:26:23.330]  That's nothing compared to
[01:26:24.878 --> 01:26:26.639]  Turning whole countries over to Al Qaeda.
[01:26:27.099 --> 01:26:30.981]  Calling it a new name, having our military aid them, lying to the American people.
[01:26:31.641 --> 01:26:47.628]  And the fact that we've had all these generals go public and analysts go public, and now we have senators investigating it, it's just ultra-massive, and I need to go around to all my reporters and all my investigative journalists and my anchors and say, listen, you can cover whatever you want, because you've all got great instincts, I like what you cover.
[01:26:48.268 --> 01:27:00.811]  I mean, I'm very, very hands-off around here, but we need to make this a major, major, major priority, because I see so many headlines on Infowars that get it right.
[01:27:01.251 --> 01:27:03.392]  You know, Western governments caught funding ISIS.
[01:27:04.112 --> 01:27:05.732]  Russia says West's running ISIS.
[01:27:06.072 --> 01:27:07.813]  Russia says Turkey's buying ISIS oil.
[01:27:08.013 --> 01:27:10.813]  It's all admitted, but those headlines aren't even hardcore enough.
[01:27:11.834 --> 01:27:13.514]  I see some headlines that we run that are like,
[01:27:14.961 --> 01:27:15.301]  U.S.
[01:27:15.381 --> 01:27:16.522]  underestimated ISIS.
[01:27:16.562 --> 01:27:17.662]  That's kind of the spin.
[01:27:17.682 --> 01:27:19.462]  They didn't underestimate Jack Squat.
[01:27:19.963 --> 01:27:22.223]  It started coming out that our government was funding it.
[01:27:22.583 --> 01:27:24.264]  Our own military said they wouldn't be part of it.
[01:27:24.564 --> 01:27:30.626]  So everything else has been an obfuscation, a muddying of the water, a smoke screen to confuse everyone.
[01:27:30.666 --> 01:27:33.847]  Hillary said, oh Benghazi and ISIS is fog of war.
[01:27:34.127 --> 01:27:35.247]  No, it's not, you witch!
[01:27:35.507 --> 01:27:37.568]  The fog's coming out of your broomstick, lady!
[01:27:37.808 --> 01:27:39.248]  You're running the whole stinking thing!
[01:27:39.428 --> 01:27:41.469]  We got you locked on target!
[01:27:41.949 --> 01:27:43.190]  You understand politically!
[01:27:43.410 --> 01:27:45.331]  All we gotta do is, I have you now!
[01:27:45.872 --> 01:27:47.613]  And it's... Goodbye!
[01:27:47.813 --> 01:27:48.353]  Goodbye!
[01:27:48.534 --> 01:27:49.014]  Goodbye!
[01:27:49.174 --> 01:27:49.754]  We have you!
[01:27:49.814 --> 01:27:51.115]  The generals are going public!
[01:27:51.335 --> 01:27:52.056]  It's so huge!
[01:27:52.096 --> 01:27:52.716]  It's so big!
[01:27:52.897 --> 01:27:53.777]  It's so bonkers!
[01:27:54.117 --> 01:27:58.140]  And I've been living with this for so long, I don't even cover it properly!
[01:27:59.341 --> 01:28:00.402]  What is my problem?! !
[01:28:02.407 --> 01:28:02.947]  Tellin' ya!
[01:28:03.227 --> 01:28:04.588]  We're gonna get this done!
[01:28:04.788 --> 01:28:14.330]  These pieces of murdering filth think they can just run around and kill everybody in front of us and run Al-Qaeda and run terror attacks and let the jihadis in and we don't do anything?
[01:28:14.610 --> 01:28:16.230]  We're gonna do something about it!
[01:28:16.630 --> 01:28:18.051]  We're gonna get out of our trance!
[01:28:18.251 --> 01:28:19.371]  We're gonna get involved!
[01:28:19.551 --> 01:28:20.731]  We're gonna expose it!
[01:28:20.751 --> 01:28:22.092]  Appreciate your call.
[01:28:22.112 --> 01:28:27.233]  I mean, that's what this comes down to, people.
[01:28:28.482 --> 01:28:32.428]  Is we're in a trance and we don't care and so am I. Well I'm breaking out of the trance.
[01:28:32.748 --> 01:28:36.373]  It's sensational that criminals have hijacked our government.
[01:28:38.256 --> 01:28:41.301]  It is sensational that we're not doing anything about it.
[01:28:43.021 --> 01:28:45.564]  It's sensational they're trying to teach five-year-olds how to be trannies.
[01:28:45.804 --> 01:28:47.926]  It's sensational they're trying to forcibly inoculate us.
[01:28:48.206 --> 01:28:57.836]  It's sensational they got the NSA surveilling everything we do, but won't tell governors and don't know where the refugees crawling with Al-Qaeda and ISIS are going.
[01:28:58.197 --> 01:28:59.438]  It's sensational!
[01:29:00.419 --> 01:29:05.044]  This criminal government, this occupied government, this criminal group has hijacked this nation 110%.
[01:29:07.253 --> 01:29:09.034]  And my theatrics are theatrics.
[01:29:09.054 --> 01:29:09.554]  They're real.
[01:29:10.414 --> 01:29:12.375]  What I'm doing right now getting angry and mad is real.
[01:29:12.795 --> 01:29:14.256]  It's me not controlling myself.
[01:29:15.036 --> 01:29:16.237]  So it's 90% real.
[01:29:17.137 --> 01:29:20.539]  As a man, I can control myself and not get angry on air and have a heart attack.
[01:29:21.679 --> 01:29:23.260]  Or maybe get mad at somebody in traffic.
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:23.540]  I don't.
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:24.341]  I let it out here on air.
[01:29:24.761 --> 01:29:25.641]  I leave it here on the field.
[01:29:26.101 --> 01:29:26.782]  This is real.
[01:29:27.502 --> 01:29:28.062]  It's real.
[01:29:28.162 --> 01:29:32.024]  I'm mad, but I'm letting myself do this so that people get what's going on.
[01:29:34.053 --> 01:29:44.801]  Do you understand, you murdering terrorist filth that put fluoride in our water, try to brain damage our kids, and try to teach kids 2 plus 2 equals 5, and that debt limits don't raise debt limits, and that we didn't build our businesses?
[01:29:44.981 --> 01:29:46.522]  You pieces of murdering filth!
[01:29:46.742 --> 01:29:52.647]  We're better than you, and we're gonna break the conditioning, and the sleeping giant is gonna take you down, globalists!
[01:29:52.947 --> 01:29:53.928]  Do you understand?
[01:29:53.988 --> 01:29:56.770]  The spirit of liberty is rising!
[01:29:59.284 --> 01:30:02.251]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.271 --> 01:30:05.899]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.265 --> 01:30:12.467]  Another GOP debate is upon us.
[01:30:12.967 --> 01:30:18.591]  A time to see how much attention will be allotted to establishment candidates who are dragging in the polls.
[01:30:19.031 --> 01:30:20.292]  These are Republican governors.
[01:30:20.672 --> 01:30:23.054]  They don't give any credit to the free market.
[01:30:23.234 --> 01:30:25.335]  They don't give any credit to the entrepreneur.
[01:30:25.755 --> 01:30:27.136]  All is not lost, though.
[01:30:27.517 --> 01:30:29.318]  Some are speaking on real issues.
[01:30:29.678 --> 01:30:34.601]  But if you're not going to respond in a no-fly zone strategy, what would yours be?
[01:30:35.222 --> 01:30:37.984]  The first thing I would do is I wouldn't arm our enemies.
[01:30:38.584 --> 01:30:39.585]  I wouldn't arm ISIS.
[01:30:40.325 --> 01:30:40.605]  Yes.
[01:30:41.366 --> 01:30:44.368]  Will controversial statements impact some of the candidates?
[01:30:44.668 --> 01:30:58.416]  Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.

[01:31:41.796 --> 01:31:46.559]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:31:46.619 --> 01:31:49.961]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:31:50.221 --> 01:31:51.842]  No needles, no injections.

[01:32:50.022 --> 01:32:53.223]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:32:53.503 --> 01:32:55.303]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.

[01:33:20.277 --> 01:33:26.441]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:30.718]  I'm not dead yet.
[01:33:31.358 --> 01:33:32.258]  Not in a trance.
[01:33:32.859 --> 01:33:34.179]  Not submitting to tyranny.
[01:33:34.579 --> 01:33:35.180]  I'm alive.
[01:33:42.683 --> 01:33:45.965]  When the enemy comes, he will never be heard.
[01:33:45.985 --> 01:33:47.425]  He'll blow your mind.
[01:33:48.626 --> 01:33:50.127]  And not say a word.
[01:33:52.202 --> 01:33:59.723]  That's what the culture, it's what the GMO, it's what the creeping death of the open borders and the radical Islamists is pouring in is all about.
[01:34:00.904 --> 01:34:08.425]  The incremental conquering through organized, controlled crisis of not just the West, but the entire world.
[01:34:15.946 --> 01:34:18.587]  And as the sleeping giant awakens,
[01:34:19.528 --> 01:34:29.610]  The criminal class that's infested many areas of government corporations attempt to expand their control and bully us into submission.

[01:36:28.656 --> 01:36:32.057]  Now, the whole Visa
[01:36:33.277 --> 01:36:41.780]  Controversy that's been coming out the last few weeks after the attacks in San Bernardino that left 14 dead has really been coming to a head.
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:45.742]  And then even more came out today, even though I've been working for about a week.
[01:36:46.998 --> 01:36:50.499]  to get Mr. Springman on the broadcast.
[01:36:50.599 --> 01:37:00.643]  Michael Springman, MichaelSpringman.com, served as the United States government as a diplomat with the State Department's Foreign Service, while posting in Germany, India, and Saudi Arabia, and also worked with the U.S.
[01:37:00.663 --> 01:37:01.263]  Commerce Department.
[01:37:01.723 --> 01:37:05.804]  He left federal service and currently practices law in the Washington, D.C.
[01:37:05.964 --> 01:37:06.305]  area.
[01:37:06.725 --> 01:37:08.805]  MichaelSpringman.com.
[01:37:09.546 --> 01:37:10.226]  That's two N's.
[01:37:11.798 --> 01:37:27.445]  And he came out after 9-11 and talked to his colleagues who were openly told, you're going to let, and he's told the story before so I'm just recapping, he's getting a new stuff today, these people in that have these terrorist backgrounds, and he said, well we're not going to do that, and they said, well they work for the CIA basically, so we've been ordered to.
[01:37:29.978 --> 01:37:34.744]  And now we see, and of course this was back in 2001, 2002 he exposed all this.
[01:37:34.804 --> 01:37:38.428]  Now we see everything he talked about confirmed in spades every day.
[01:37:38.849 --> 01:37:40.931]  And his book exposes the whole situation.
[01:37:40.951 --> 01:37:43.614]  We'll tell you about the title of that as well and put that up on screen.
[01:37:43.995 --> 01:37:45.256]  Visas for Al Qaeda.
[01:37:47.038 --> 01:37:49.762]  CIA handouts that rock the world.
[01:37:50.751 --> 01:37:57.036]  And that book is available at InfoWarsStore.com and Better Bookstores and Amazon and the rest of it as well.
[01:37:57.576 --> 01:37:59.938]  And sure, you're awake, but what about your friends and family?
[01:38:00.379 --> 01:38:00.999]  Buy them the book.
[01:38:01.039 --> 01:38:01.540]  Give it to them.
[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:05.543]  Support patriots and heroes that tell the truth, like Mr. Springman.
[01:38:05.583 --> 01:38:09.766]  Now, dovetail that with the British headline today out of the mirror.
[01:38:09.906 --> 01:38:13.269]  Hackers trace ISIS Twitter accounts back to British government.
[01:38:14.690 --> 01:38:16.772]  What about the Associated Press a couple months ago?
[01:38:17.945 --> 01:38:27.192]  All of ISIS's main internet accounts, their servers, based at shadowy government-connected group in Silicon Valley.
[01:38:28.993 --> 01:38:29.613]  Here's another one.
[01:38:29.733 --> 01:38:30.034]  U.S.
[01:38:30.074 --> 01:38:33.176]  visas continue to be handed out by foreign contractors.
[01:38:33.296 --> 01:38:36.238]  Infowars.com, Wayne Madsen, that joins us in the next hour.
[01:38:36.598 --> 01:38:37.559]  Formerly with the NSA.
[01:38:37.939 --> 01:38:42.862]  Immigration officials prohibited from looking at visa applicants' social media.
[01:38:43.143 --> 01:38:43.563]  The Hill.
[01:38:45.248 --> 01:38:46.869]  Oh, but they know all about us.
[01:38:47.329 --> 01:38:49.810]  NATO Nations Training Recruiting Jihadist.
[01:38:51.051 --> 01:38:57.234]  We have the former head of defense intelligence coming out two months ago and saying they were ordered to fund and create the ISIS group.
[01:38:57.695 --> 01:38:58.255]  Consciously.
[01:38:58.775 --> 01:39:02.137]  Turkish Imams USA network of schools to be investigated.
[01:39:03.952 --> 01:39:06.954]  500 million a year in taxpayer money just in Texas alone.
[01:39:06.974 --> 01:39:09.456]  1,000 schools worldwide.
[01:39:09.976 --> 01:39:14.619]  Maryland man accused of receiving 9,000 from ISIS to carry out attack on American soil.
[01:39:14.679 --> 01:39:15.419]  Washington Post.
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:24.225]  And then this story right over here, dealing with folks with gas, poison gas caught coming into Switzerland.
[01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:42.015]  All these jihad attacks, what would the West be thinking out of war-torn Syria to be bringing in almost exclusively Sunnis, many of which are fake, not Syrians, fake passports upwards of 80% the EU admits, allowing them in and then not letting governors even know who they are and letting them disappear?
[01:39:43.291 --> 01:39:48.814]  Is this for plausible deniability when there are terror attacks that will be used to take our basic freedoms, restrict internet freedom?
[01:39:49.634 --> 01:39:50.675]  What is the game plan?
[01:39:50.975 --> 01:39:54.476]  We have the expert here to give his view on what's happening.
[01:39:54.556 --> 01:39:59.959]  I mean, when you talked about what you exposed 14 years ago, Mr. Springman, it was sensational but documented.
[01:39:59.979 --> 01:40:05.742]  I mean, I want to say you are quintupled verified, certified, confirmed.
[01:40:06.562 --> 01:40:08.323]  Now, though, it's so naked.
[01:40:08.743 --> 01:40:10.024]  What do you make of this?
[01:40:11.195 --> 01:40:12.496]  Well, I'm flabbergasted.
[01:40:12.776 --> 01:40:21.122]  Every time I look at an article on the visas for these two people out in California, I get a different story.
[01:40:22.003 --> 01:40:27.107]  They keep saying that, well, it was a K-1 fiancé visa.
[01:40:28.488 --> 01:40:34.893]  And then you read, well, yeah, it's a K-1 fiancé visa, but they've been married in Saudi Arabia.
[01:40:36.531 --> 01:40:38.392]  And it just doesn't track.
[01:40:38.472 --> 01:40:43.294]  If you were married in Saudi Arabia or anywhere else, you don't get a fiancé visa.
[01:40:44.134 --> 01:40:51.177]  You get an immediate relative visa and you have to apply for it with a petition for the alien relative.
[01:40:51.818 --> 01:40:52.818]  It's more paperwork.
[01:40:54.005 --> 01:41:04.648]  And even the K-1 visa requires you to go into great detail about your background, both the American citizen and the foreign national.
[01:41:04.708 --> 01:41:08.049]  They ask for things like, are you a terrorist?
[01:41:08.069 --> 01:41:10.890]  Do you plan to come to America and engage in terrorism?
[01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:14.531]  Have you contributed to terrorist organizations?
[01:41:15.451 --> 01:41:16.931]  And what were your parents' names?
[01:41:17.011 --> 01:41:17.992]  And where did they live?
[01:41:18.052 --> 01:41:20.332]  And what were their addresses and phone numbers?
[01:41:20.552 --> 01:41:22.413]  And what is your identity card number?
[01:41:22.513 --> 01:41:23.173]  And so forth.
[01:41:24.016 --> 01:41:44.144]  So there's plenty of information available for the Central Intelligence Agency, which does these background checks abroad, and for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which does them in the United States and could well do it abroad, since they have a FBI special agent, a legal attache at nearly every embassy in the world.
[01:41:45.125 --> 01:41:47.265]  So I am just thrown by all of this.
[01:41:47.405 --> 01:41:53.368]  It looks like somebody gave Bill Lincoln a nod to pass this woman into the United States.
[01:41:55.716 --> 01:41:56.998]  I don't know how they did it.
[01:41:57.618 --> 01:42:16.817]  If you get married abroad, even in a Muslim contract marriage where you're not really married until you have the actual wedding ceremony, that's registered, at least in Saudi Arabia it is, and any cursory check of their background would turn this up.
[01:42:18.359 --> 01:42:20.600]  They'd say no, you're ineligible for a KY.
[01:42:33.558 --> 01:42:50.784]  While we have him do that, I want to bring up New York Daily News, CBS News, two weeks ago, a plane load of 150, but I see these stories every few weeks, comes in out of Mexico, lands, no one's checked at customs, no IDs are checked, they're just allowed to come right out on the street.
[01:42:51.284 --> 01:42:53.685]  Now, this is now being done, quote, where Mexico
[01:42:54.585 --> 01:42:57.808]  With the Border Patrol, quote, completes the smuggling process.
[01:42:58.209 --> 01:43:00.090]  That's a quote from senior Border Patrol agents.
[01:43:00.531 --> 01:43:14.464]  We broke that news a year ago, where we were told by Border Patrol to go to a spot in Texas, and they were loading them on the buses with no ID, giving them vouchers to go wherever they wanted to Democrat Party operations, basically.
[01:43:15.144 --> 01:43:17.266]  And I'm nonpartisan, but that's who was behind this.
[01:43:18.519 --> 01:43:30.657]  I mean, how do you do that and then have a police state and take all our rights and have surveillance, but then actually bring folks in from drug-torn and war-torn and terror-torn areas and just march people through, sir?
[01:43:30.677 --> 01:43:33.341]  I mean, doesn't this disqualify the entire war on terror?
[01:43:33.361 --> 01:43:34.682]  It sure does.
[01:43:37.129 --> 01:43:40.970]  So please continue elaborating on that because it's so brazen.
[01:43:41.050 --> 01:43:41.910]  What are they thinking?
[01:43:42.170 --> 01:43:43.350]  How dumb do they think we are?
[01:43:45.111 --> 01:43:49.152]  They do a great job of getting it through the media.
[01:43:49.232 --> 01:43:53.373]  All you hear is how wonderful this is, how wonderful these people are for the United States.
[01:43:54.413 --> 01:43:58.294]  We can't send these people back because they will be sent back to a terrible country.
[01:43:59.414 --> 01:44:03.435]  And yet they throw all of the regulations and laws out the window to bring in
[01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:07.111]  People with really strange backgrounds.
[01:44:08.852 --> 01:44:18.576]  I talked to a lot of Europeans, a lot of Latin Americans, a lot of Asians, and it seems like the more professional, no criminal records, have real reasons to be here.
[01:44:18.616 --> 01:44:20.517]  They're really married to an American.
[01:44:20.557 --> 01:44:21.617]  They really have a job.
[01:44:21.977 --> 01:44:25.139]  It's so hard when you try to submit and do it right.
[01:44:25.519 --> 01:44:30.961]  But if you are with some fake ID or don't even have one, I've witnessed people just let through.
[01:44:31.261 --> 01:44:32.182]  This is bizarre.
[01:44:34.397 --> 01:44:51.118]  I know people who had God's own time with immigration when they had a legal benefit to which they were entitled and immigration lost their papers or delayed the situation, confused them with a Tongan from the South Pacific with a different alien number.
[01:44:52.930 --> 01:45:03.185]  It's just the people who do it the right way and who pay lots of money to immigration and to attorneys to get them through the process, they're screaming mad.
[01:45:03.265 --> 01:45:05.268]  And it's Arabs to Ukrainians.
[01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:09.154]  They cannot understand what the American government is doing.
[01:45:10.461 --> 01:45:19.927]  In fact, a lot of the folks that have contacted me freaked out over the migrant waves are Middle Easterners, are Europeans, are Russians, you name it.
[01:45:20.127 --> 01:45:22.969]  But a lot of them are Muslims and they say, no, we totally agree.
[01:45:23.349 --> 01:45:25.710]  It's hard for us as citizens to go back and forth.
[01:45:25.730 --> 01:45:27.551]  We get harassed because we're Muslims.
[01:45:27.811 --> 01:45:37.437]  But then we just watch people literally from Saudi Arabia just flooding in when most Arab countries don't like Saudi Arabia because they know that's the country that exports jihadis to kill them.
[01:45:37.677 --> 01:45:39.839]  I mean, why is our government allied
[01:45:40.379 --> 01:45:41.119]  With the bad guys.
[01:45:41.179 --> 01:45:42.180]  I mean, I'm the one saying that.
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:43.000]  A, do you agree?
[01:45:43.321 --> 01:45:45.782]  How does it tie into the 28 pages and what you went through?
[01:45:45.802 --> 01:45:54.226]  Well, I'd say it all hangs together, and the more explanations the government gives, the stranger it gets.
[01:45:55.247 --> 01:45:59.049]  I had a client one time who had been half her life in the United States.
[01:45:59.269 --> 01:46:08.474]  She worked for a high security company, but she was an Arab and a Muslim, and every time she came into the United States from a business trip abroad, she was harassed.
[01:46:09.761 --> 01:46:21.310]  And when she filed for citizenship, it took a trip to federal court to get the government's attention, and even in that case, the judge dismissed the matter, saying this shouldn't be in court.
[01:46:23.491 --> 01:46:30.056]  In fact, I had a client send me a note from the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California.
[01:46:30.076 --> 01:46:31.537]  They produced a
[01:46:33.996 --> 01:46:48.396]  A study that said Muslims need not apply and for five megabytes it went on to talk about how there was a distinct US government policy to delay or deny benefits for immigration to Arabs and Muslims.
[01:46:49.488 --> 01:46:54.693]  But they will then bring in people from war-torn zones, shop full of former combatants.
[01:46:55.693 --> 01:47:02.019]  What do you think the government's thinking when these groups start blowing stuff up and shooting people as they've already begun in Europe and here?
[01:47:02.579 --> 01:47:07.383]  And then we turn out that the FBI was on Malik and her husband for two years, blocked.
[01:47:08.124 --> 01:47:09.605]  I mean, it really is bizarre.
[01:47:09.645 --> 01:47:12.128]  I mean, my reporters went up to upstate New York to report.
[01:47:12.947 --> 01:47:13.687]  We're good to go.
[01:47:26.024 --> 01:47:30.286]  And told them we're tracking you, and you're not here to stir up trouble, are you?
[01:47:30.306 --> 01:47:37.509]  So when you're actually going and investigating real groups that have been connected to real things, it's a no-go.
[01:47:37.969 --> 01:47:46.613]  But then if you are a real doctor, say, from Egypt, with no criminal record, you're an archaeologist, and you try to come over here to move here or even visit your family, then you get arrested.
[01:47:46.673 --> 01:47:47.654]  I mean, it just makes no sense.
[01:47:48.254 --> 01:47:48.814]  Oh, exactly.
[01:47:48.854 --> 01:47:57.876]  I mean, Michel Chossodovsky and his global research site up in Canada very kindly put up an article I had written about the Paris attacks.
[01:47:58.636 --> 01:48:09.079]  And the thrust of the article was that the idea was to move Muslims and Arabs and all sorts of other people out of the Middle East and from elsewhere into Europe
[01:48:09.679 --> 01:48:16.504]  To create dissension and hostility and to try and drag Europeans into a war in the Middle East.
[01:48:17.245 --> 01:48:19.046]  So far, the Germans have been out of it.
[01:48:19.447 --> 01:48:21.068]  The French were not too deeply into it.
[01:48:22.012 --> 01:48:22.913]  And the British weren't.
[01:48:23.234 --> 01:48:40.815]  Yet, within a couple of weeks of this happening, the Germans send warships to the Mediterranean, the French send an aircraft carrier, they start bombing Syria and Iraq, the British go back into bombing, and they're putting restrictions on people's civil liberties in France.
[01:48:41.616 --> 01:48:51.399]  So it's a way of getting these people into fighting the evil Muslims and the evil Arabs without a shred of proof that there are such people.
[01:48:51.959 --> 01:49:01.962]  And they do it because of social and geopolitical illiteracy, just like Saudi Arabia is involved in attacking us on 9-11, we attack Iraq, their archenemy, that's secular and not working with them.
[01:49:02.262 --> 01:49:02.842]  Same thing here.
[01:49:03.402 --> 01:49:22.250]  The German everybody's now saying, get rid of Assad, it's his fault there's refugees, when he didn't start the civil war, the EU, NATO, the US, Turkey, Israel, Saudi Arabia, number one, all involved, and then they think we're so dumb, now we've got to remove Assad because of the refugee crisis that our own governments caused.
[01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:23.430]  Exactly.
[01:49:24.330 --> 01:49:45.934]  And the amazing thing with all of this is that nobody questions it, that you've got all of these things happening, they want to bring thousands of refugees to the United States, yet I've had clients who were married to American citizens and who couldn't get into the United States even though they'd worked for the American government into Iraq.
[01:49:46.194 --> 01:49:48.975]  They had to check and check and check their background for years.
[01:49:51.249 --> 01:49:57.837]  But if you're just a jihadi, I mean that's why almost all these guys are military age men, a lot of them have been confirmed to be part of the invasion.
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:01.201]  So what do you think the endgame is?
[01:50:01.241 --> 01:50:08.611]  Take our liberties like you said, set up a police state, out of the crisis, and then end up attacking countries that are actually fighting the very same jihadis?
[01:50:09.403 --> 01:50:09.903]  Exactly.
[01:50:09.983 --> 01:50:28.075]  I mean, you had Saudi Arabia, they've announced on RIT this morning that these people are putting together a 40-nation alliance to fight ISIL, and the countries that the Saudis have rounded up are basically the organizations and countries and governments
[01:50:28.795 --> 01:50:36.699]  That are supporting ISIL, that are giving the money to them so they can buy weapons to destroy Syria and other countries in the region.
[01:50:36.819 --> 01:50:38.379]  It's beyond belief.
[01:50:38.459 --> 01:50:42.041]  It makes 1984 look like a child's comic book.
[01:50:44.198 --> 01:50:46.980]  And it's because of political ignorance, folks, that they can get away with this.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:53.967]  The problem is there's a large minority worldwide that understands the exact divide-and-conquer strategy, and our own military is investigating it.
[01:50:54.307 --> 01:50:56.208]  The Pentagon has an investigation going.
[01:50:56.269 --> 01:50:57.369]  Generals are going public.
[01:50:58.110 --> 01:50:59.531]  The system has a big problem.
[01:50:59.611 --> 01:51:00.953]  This, I think, is starting to unravel.
[01:51:01.193 --> 01:51:08.019]  We're going to ask Michael Springman, a big 9-11 whistleblower, if he thinks it is unraveling and what we can do to reverse these war crimes.
[01:51:09.901 --> 01:51:13.882]  With a new year coming, it's time for a new way to look at weapon storage.
[01:51:14.162 --> 01:51:17.282]  Safes can't be accessed quickly and racks are unsafe for children.
[01:51:17.402 --> 01:51:19.903]  Covert Cabinets are the next level in home defense.
[01:51:19.983 --> 01:51:25.384]  They fit seamlessly into any home's decor and they provide quick access to firearms while keeping them uniquely hidden.
[01:51:25.424 --> 01:51:28.004]  Covert Cabinets, the ideal hidden storage solution.
[01:51:28.044 --> 01:51:29.424]  Custom made in the USA.
[01:51:29.524 --> 01:51:34.985]  Covert Cabinets are an elegant and practical alternative to the bulky and obvious storage systems of the past.

[01:54:14.574 --> 01:54:15.915]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:54:15.975 --> 01:54:18.537]  I'm sure it supports the local affiliates you're listening on.
[01:54:18.597 --> 01:54:19.458]  Spread the word about them.
[01:54:19.798 --> 01:54:20.919]  Please don't take them for granted.
[01:54:21.359 --> 01:54:25.503]  And become a sponsor or support the sponsors and let the station know why you're supporting sponsors.
[01:54:25.923 --> 01:54:28.165]  Do they have a remote at a restaurant or car dealership?
[01:54:28.905 --> 01:54:29.766]  Come visit the remote.
[01:54:30.907 --> 01:54:35.030]  If they are promoting a particular product, check that product out and let them know why.
[01:54:35.948 --> 01:54:41.172]  It is essential in an InfoWars to fight George Soros and all the globalist money with your money.
[01:54:41.592 --> 01:54:42.813]  Even little amounts of it.
[01:54:43.453 --> 01:54:45.835]  And your word of mouth will change the world.
[01:54:46.496 --> 01:54:50.879]  Will change what the neocons and the controlled left and all these groups are up to.
[01:54:51.419 --> 01:54:53.421]  The newest stories up on InfoWars.com.
[01:54:53.481 --> 01:54:58.925]  British governments now pointing to Saudis as Islamic State posts are discovered on government IP addresses.
[01:54:59.978 --> 01:55:01.099]  Uh, no folks, it's come out.
[01:55:01.119 --> 01:55:07.201]  The British government, probably more than anybody, when it comes to actual logistics, has always been running the Saudi Arabian terror groups.
[01:55:07.561 --> 01:55:11.743]  They set them up over a hundred years ago with the first king of Saudi Arabia.
[01:55:12.023 --> 01:55:13.884]  They created Saudi Arabia.
[01:55:14.084 --> 01:55:15.764]  Go watch Lawrence of Arabia.
[01:55:16.465 --> 01:55:19.826]  They go and take over Syria in that movie, because it's a true story.
[01:55:20.326 --> 01:55:21.727]  But they make them the good guys.
[01:55:22.627 --> 01:55:23.748]  Caravan raiders.
[01:55:24.208 --> 01:55:25.628]  Actual hardcore criminals.
[01:55:25.908 --> 01:55:26.349]  Pirates.
[01:55:27.069 --> 01:55:27.529]  Thuggies.
[01:55:27.989 --> 01:55:29.250]  They're basically thuggies.
[01:55:30.926 --> 01:55:34.208]  The House of Saud probably isn't even Saudi Arabian.
[01:55:34.329 --> 01:55:41.015]  Some evidence shows they're connected to the ancient spice trade all the way to India and are actually thuggy.
[01:55:41.515 --> 01:55:42.316]  And I'm not joking.
[01:55:42.376 --> 01:55:43.537]  Look up what a thuggy is.
[01:55:44.978 --> 01:55:49.082]  And they did operate in Saudi Arabia, by the way, all the way through Iran, all the way into India.
[01:55:49.912 --> 01:55:52.195]  They kill you and bury you and your family after they rob you.
[01:55:52.755 --> 01:55:55.459]  Now, let's continue here with Mr. Springman.
[01:55:55.859 --> 01:56:00.485]  Feds ignored Islamic terror threat before San Bernardino to focus on right-wing radicals.
[01:56:01.125 --> 01:56:05.270]  Numerous DHS FBI reports downplayed or completely omitted Muslim jihadists.
[01:56:06.124 --> 01:56:09.867]  Mr. Springman, in this little segment in five minutes to the next hour, I'm going to let you go because you're a busy man.
[01:56:10.168 --> 01:56:12.089]  Constitutional lawyer, michaelspringman.com.
[01:56:12.429 --> 01:56:15.312]  What are points you'd like to make or areas you'd like to get into?
[01:56:15.332 --> 01:56:17.474]  Because I'm kind of uncovering the waterfront here.
[01:56:17.494 --> 01:56:21.177]  My only other question is, where do you see this going?
[01:56:21.297 --> 01:56:22.118]  Is it unraveling?
[01:56:23.444 --> 01:56:25.666]  Well it depends on what you define as unraveling.
[01:56:26.646 --> 01:56:41.838]  The American terror program, support for fanatics, recruitment of fanatics, arming of fanatics, that unfortunately seems to be increasing and the American people are paying a price.
[01:56:42.118 --> 01:56:45.260]  Money that goes into this to support this forever war
[01:56:46.321 --> 01:57:03.586]  And to support fanatics around the world, prevents Americans from having their bridges rebuilt, from having their roads rebuilt, from having their water systems rebuilt, and you wind up with water main breaks, pieces of bridges landing on people's windshields, and so on.
[01:57:04.591 --> 01:57:19.019]  So I don't think it's going to get any better, and I am not really optimistic that there will be anybody coming out of the woodwork in America to say enough is enough, it's time to put an end to this.
[01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:29.685]  What happens, unfortunately, is you have these special interest groups and the big money that are supporting people like Barry Obama and Hillary Clinton and others.
[01:57:30.891 --> 01:57:56.565]  And it's basically two branches of the same permanent ruling party that may differ on minor details, but certainly when you're talking about war abroad, support for terrorism, allow crazies into the United States, but keep out doctors, lawyers, and so forth, who have a legitimate right to come here, who have a legitimate claim to immigration benefits, I think it's the sixth system.
[01:57:57.605 --> 01:57:59.807]  And nobody wants to reform it.
[01:57:59.827 --> 01:58:04.230]  They want to make changes to give amnesty to who knows what.
[01:58:07.352 --> 01:58:08.493]  Where does it go from here?
[01:58:08.553 --> 01:58:15.118]  Because it's bipartisan, the West, working with these radical jihad groups, and so that's why they keep wanting to cover it up, but it's still coming out.
[01:58:16.858 --> 01:58:29.363]  I know, it's astonishing that they've kept the lid on so long, and more than 20 years later I have yet to find out why I was officially fired by the State Department.
[01:58:29.483 --> 01:58:42.868]  They shut down the first Freedom of Information Act request as a threat to national security, and the second one they simply shut it down saying the State Department shreds visa applications every year, when in fact they don't.
[01:58:43.863 --> 01:58:47.686]  Wow, and the cover up now gets bigger and bigger and has more holes in it than Swiss cheese.
[01:58:47.747 --> 01:58:48.627]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:48.948 --> 01:58:52.631]  One more segment with Springman, then we've got one thing only.
[01:58:53.311 --> 01:58:54.713]  Joining us, Wayne Mattson.
[01:58:54.753 --> 01:58:56.094]  Stay with us, we've got breaking news.
[01:58:59.847 --> 01:59:01.168]  I want more candy!
[01:59:01.188 --> 01:59:01.948]  I want more video games!
[01:59:02.169 --> 01:59:02.269]  Why?
[01:59:02.289 --> 01:59:02.369]  Why?
[01:59:02.529 --> 01:59:02.749]  Why?
[01:59:29.867 --> 01:59:30.627]  I think so.
[02:00:01.866 --> 02:00:04.474]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:23.684 --> 02:00:30.010]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.551 --> 02:00:33.834]  And it's Junior Brown bringing us in.
[02:00:34.274 --> 02:00:35.655]  Amazing skilled guitarist.
[02:00:36.296 --> 02:00:36.917]  Might be the best.
[02:00:36.937 --> 02:00:41.481]  I don't know, Weldon Henson's guy plays for some of the biggest bands out there.
[02:00:41.581 --> 02:00:42.222]  They say he may be...
[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:47.160]  We're going to come back from break.
[02:00:47.180 --> 02:00:52.923]  Dr. Kevin in West Virginia, James in Canada, who's been holding first, Jerry, Michael, and others.
[02:00:52.983 --> 02:01:02.487]  Mr. Springman is our guest, MichaelSpringman.com, and he's one of many people fired who got in trouble, or you name it, for trying to keep radical jihadis in who are connected to Al Qaeda and others.
[02:01:03.877 --> 02:01:10.139]  His book is Visas for Al-Qaeda and now we learn they were protecting the husband and wife team from San Bernardino.
[02:01:10.159 --> 02:01:12.380]  I mean, what does the government get?
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:15.501]  Well, they think we're so dumb they don't get the blame for bringing them in.
[02:01:15.921 --> 02:01:19.182]  They'll get more armored vehicles, more checkpoints, more drones, more of our freedoms.
[02:01:19.222 --> 02:01:21.103]  I agree with Springman's analysis.
[02:01:24.525 --> 02:01:25.926]  Other points on this.
[02:01:26.286 --> 02:01:27.886]  What do you think we can do, Mr. Sprigman?
[02:01:27.906 --> 02:01:28.827]  Just keep heat on them?
[02:01:29.327 --> 02:01:30.427]  Congressional investigations?
[02:01:30.467 --> 02:01:31.127]  I have this story.
[02:01:31.507 --> 02:01:32.668]  CENTCOM investigation.
[02:01:32.708 --> 02:01:34.489]  War on Syria, not the Islamic State.
[02:01:35.089 --> 02:01:36.909]  And you read the story at Infowars.com.
[02:01:36.949 --> 02:01:44.612]  It's got links, even to the Daily Beast and the House Armed Services Committee admitting, okay, our government ran ISIS.
[02:01:44.652 --> 02:01:45.412]  We want to know why.
[02:01:45.793 --> 02:01:49.754]  I mean, it's very positive that at least this is now being looked at.
[02:01:52.260 --> 02:02:11.028]  I think the way out, if we can get a way out, is to get people in Congress who are not afraid to take the point on this and to build a fire under the executive branch and judicial branch saying enough is enough, we want full and complete disclosure.
[02:02:11.889 --> 02:02:16.911]  And one very good way they can do it is simply have a parade of congressmen go in and look at the
[02:02:18.436 --> 02:02:35.576]  The concealed and still secret 28 pages in the September 11th report on intelligence failures and simply memorize a paragraph or a couple of sentences and get onto the floor of the House or the Senate and say, this is what I saw in that reading room.
[02:02:36.628 --> 02:02:41.049]  And put it out on the air, put it out in print, and see what happens from this.
[02:02:41.150 --> 02:02:46.731]  Well, we've had a few of them on here, like Walter Jones, and it says Saudi Arabia consciously at the highest levels ran the attacks.
[02:02:47.111 --> 02:02:50.773]  Our government knew from the beginning, stood down on purpose, basically complicit.
[02:02:51.153 --> 02:02:52.633]  It is bombshell information.
[02:02:52.993 --> 02:02:54.054]  It is treason proven.
[02:02:54.494 --> 02:02:55.794]  And people say, oh, it's worse than that.
[02:02:56.054 --> 02:02:58.815]  We know, but we have them in their own report.
[02:02:59.335 --> 02:03:01.196]  I mean, so if that comes out, it all comes out.
[02:03:02.452 --> 02:03:03.813]  Yeah, and they've got to start doing this.
[02:03:03.833 --> 02:03:11.298]  I mean, you had Dennis Kucinich who would question this, but he's been gerrymandered out of Congress by the Democrat branch of the Permanent Party.
[02:03:12.518 --> 02:03:22.985]  And the people we've got in the past, for example, we had the Church Report that really went to town on the intelligence services, and we need people like that again.
[02:03:24.261 --> 02:03:28.502]  Well, this time it's our own intelligence services coming out saying it's all a fraud, our military saying it.
[02:03:28.862 --> 02:03:32.383]  It's not usually the military, you know, having to try to stop wars.
[02:03:32.443 --> 02:03:34.164]  Usually they're trying to start it, at least in the past.
[02:03:34.484 --> 02:03:39.225]  That shows how corrupt our elite are that we actually have a lot of generals doing the right thing now, which is unprecedented.
[02:03:39.966 --> 02:03:40.586]  Yeah, it is.
[02:03:40.786 --> 02:03:43.647]  I mean, we need more people like Smedley Butler from the 1930s.
[02:03:45.987 --> 02:03:53.311]  Well, I mean, the folks running the show there need to know that all these yes men and women are really creating a climate of absolute and complete tyranny.
[02:03:53.351 --> 02:03:54.672]  MichaelSpringman.com.
[02:03:55.112 --> 02:03:56.613]  Briefly, tell folks about the book.
[02:03:56.633 --> 02:03:57.454]  I mean, I read the book.
[02:03:57.834 --> 02:03:58.915]  It's extremely powerful.
[02:03:58.955 --> 02:03:59.715]  You learn a lot.
[02:04:00.135 --> 02:04:04.258]  Everybody should buy it and donate it after they read it to the library so that more people read it.
[02:04:05.145 --> 02:04:06.186]  Yeah, great, thank you.
[02:04:07.227 --> 02:04:26.883]  The basics of the book is it's 250 pages of my own personal experience with the Department of State and with the legal system trying to find out why I have been fired, coupled with two years of research on what I call the Arab-Afghan Legion, the terrorists that the United States recruited
[02:04:27.759 --> 02:04:38.229]  For the war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union, who were then transformed or rebranded into Al Qaeda, and when that got old, they turned them into ISIL.
[02:04:38.850 --> 02:04:40.631]  And it's the same crowd of fanatics.
[02:04:41.457 --> 02:04:44.098]  I talked to Colonel Anthony Schaffer, U.S.
[02:04:44.178 --> 02:04:45.018]  Army, retired.
[02:04:46.318 --> 02:04:54.019]  He said that, yeah, the same guys that are in Iraq now fighting are the same people we recruited for Afghanistan.
[02:04:54.519 --> 02:04:56.640]  Former Senator Mike Gravel from Alaska.
[02:04:56.820 --> 02:04:59.100]  You've got a lot of amazing people who are out of time.
[02:04:59.140 --> 02:05:01.221]  Michael Springman, have a great holiday and Christmas coming up.
[02:05:01.541 --> 02:05:02.621]  MichaelSpringman.com.
[02:05:02.641 --> 02:05:06.322]  The book, Visas for Al Qaeda, available at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:05:06.702 --> 02:05:07.362]  Get it today.
[02:05:07.442 --> 02:05:07.882]  We'll be back.
[02:05:09.801 --> 02:05:15.105]  A New York City principal has banned Christmas and the Pledge of Allegiance, reports EAG News.
[02:05:15.506 --> 02:05:24.593]  The new principal has also eliminated Thanksgiving, despite clear notice from the city's Department of Education allowing for holiday themes and symbols, the New York Post writes.
[02:05:24.954 --> 02:05:26.955]  We definitely can't say Christmas.
[02:05:27.235 --> 02:05:28.436]  Nothing with Christmas on it.
[02:05:28.677 --> 02:05:32.239]  Nothing with Santa, a local PTA president told the news site.
[02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:33.380]  No angels.
[02:05:33.741 --> 02:05:38.545]  We can't even have a star because it can represent a religious system, like the Star of David.
[02:05:39.165 --> 02:05:46.511]  The report states that about 95% of the students at Brooklyn's PS169 are either Hispanic or Asian.
[02:05:47.012 --> 02:05:54.638]  And the assistant principal announced last month that the school is changing its holiday traditions to be sensitive to the diversity of our families.
[02:05:55.358 --> 02:05:58.261]  Not all children celebrate the same holidays, he added.
[02:05:58.901 --> 02:06:02.564]  And the Pledge of Allegiance was also ditched when the principal took office.
[02:06:03.065 --> 02:06:05.347]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[02:06:09.542 --> 02:06:10.963]  I want more candy!
[02:06:10.983 --> 02:06:11.643]  I want more baby again!
[02:06:11.964 --> 02:06:12.964]  Mine, mine, mine!
[02:06:39.522 --> 02:06:40.323]  I don't know.
[02:06:59.745 --> 02:07:05.313]  We have been fighting this war tirelessly with you at our side, day in and day out, exposing the ludicrous lies
[02:07:15.686 --> 02:07:17.827]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[02:07:40.100 --> 02:07:46.324]  With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse any money from globalists or government.
[02:07:46.605 --> 02:07:53.329]  We are funding our crusade against tyranny the old-fashioned way with pure free-market, free-will capitalism.

[02:08:03.336 --> 02:08:08.540]  May God bless you and your family and keep us strong as we forge ahead in this battle for humanity.
[02:08:12.202 --> 02:08:13.683]  We are on the march.
[02:08:14.043 --> 02:08:16.444]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:08:17.204 --> 02:08:20.926]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:21.966 --> 02:08:37.432]  I know we have loaded phone lines.
[02:08:37.472 --> 02:08:38.653]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:08:42.398 --> 02:08:47.381]  We're going to go to Kevin and James, and a few have been holding the longest, then we're getting Wayne Madsen Investigative Journalist on the line.
[02:08:47.401 --> 02:08:55.265]  He'll be with us in about five minutes to break down major breaking news on campaign 2016 that he's been ferreting into.
[02:08:56.125 --> 02:09:00.227]  Also, the open funding of radical jihad groups.
[02:09:01.067 --> 02:09:05.210]  He has written about that for Infowars.com and a lot more.
[02:09:05.250 --> 02:09:11.453]  And we've really reached that dam breaking moment when you've got the former head of CENTCOM and other generals and
[02:09:13.092 --> 02:09:20.559]  Inspector General investigations in the Pentagon, not about fixed intelligence, that's what the media is spinning.
[02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:28.107]  It's about the fact that our government is backing Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra, ISIS, same group, same organization, same culture.
[02:09:29.298 --> 02:09:35.362]  It's kind of like we have the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force, while they have Al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, IS.
[02:09:35.422 --> 02:09:45.588]  It's all the same black flags, same Saudi Arabian garbage, same crazed, radical Sunni trash that kills other Sunni, Shiites, Alawites, Christians.
[02:09:46.068 --> 02:09:49.671]  I mean, it is the expansionist, fascist version of Islam.
[02:09:50.031 --> 02:09:52.032]  Hands down, no debate.
[02:09:52.693 --> 02:09:56.115]  So, why does our elite think they can use them to come in and take over?
[02:09:57.085 --> 02:09:59.667]  Let him come in and attack us here and then take our freedoms.
[02:10:00.628 --> 02:10:04.671]  So Wayne Madsen is going to get into all of that and other breaking news that he's been investigating.
[02:10:04.711 --> 02:10:09.735]  He does also report for Infowars.com and two of his reports are on the site today.
[02:10:10.556 --> 02:10:13.338]  But let's go to Kevin in West Virginia and then James in Canada.
[02:10:13.679 --> 02:10:15.620]  Kevin in West Virginia, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:10:16.661 --> 02:10:17.682]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:10:17.802 --> 02:10:18.623]  Good my friend, go ahead.
[02:10:18.643 --> 02:10:21.485]  This is my thoughts.
[02:10:21.805 --> 02:10:24.267]  Mr. Obama, step down.
[02:10:24.988 --> 02:10:26.009]  Step down.
[02:10:26.562 --> 02:10:32.444]  Quit being a criminal and face the American public and take it like a man.
[02:10:34.104 --> 02:10:41.867]  Well, if Obama falls, then all the criminals around him fall, including all the neocon Republicans that have been working with him as well.
[02:10:41.947 --> 02:10:51.770]  But we have reached that point where how far can they go to come into 30 states and say we're going to bring in radical, dangerous refugees, many of them foreign fighters,
[02:10:52.290 --> 02:11:04.313]  We're not going to even let them have IDs or passports and they can just disappear and we won't tell state and homeland security or local police or state police where they are, but oh, we're following everything you do as citizens and watching you.
[02:11:04.333 --> 02:11:09.155]  I mean, this is really showing America that the police state is for us.
[02:11:10.255 --> 02:11:13.477]  Not for actual threats that are outside the country.
[02:11:13.857 --> 02:11:17.158]  It does show the war on terror is a complete fraud.
[02:11:17.579 --> 02:11:19.359]  New headline, Infowars.com.
[02:11:19.679 --> 02:11:24.041]  Feds ignore Islamic terror threat before San Bernardino to focus on right-wing radicals.
[02:11:24.662 --> 02:11:32.485]  Had the Justice Department group tried to prosecute, investigate the FBI agents and others that were investigating the husband and wife team.
[02:11:33.085 --> 02:11:34.486]  So, pretty amazing.
[02:11:35.126 --> 02:11:36.187]  What else do you have to say, Kevin?
[02:11:38.616 --> 02:11:39.876]  I agree with you 100%.
[02:11:40.496 --> 02:11:49.500]  I just feel that Obama needs to step down as well as the leaders on the right of the Republicans.
[02:11:49.901 --> 02:11:50.601]  You're criminal.
[02:11:50.701 --> 02:11:51.921]  We have you in our sights.
[02:11:52.502 --> 02:11:53.242]  We got you.
[02:11:53.262 --> 02:11:53.862]  I agree.
[02:11:54.162 --> 02:12:00.525]  Every group, that means Lindsey Graham, that means people like John McCain, that means people like
[02:12:02.646 --> 02:12:07.071]  Jeb Bush has been supporting it, but not actually in government, and others need to be investigated.
[02:12:07.532 --> 02:12:11.656]  And we've got Hillary quarterbacking it at the State Department, Obama heavily involved.
[02:12:11.977 --> 02:12:20.606]  There is a larger master strategy, and it hinges on us being completely mindless, completely ignorant geopolitically, culturally, and not knowing.
[02:12:20.667 --> 02:12:21.127]  It's just like 9-11.
[02:12:22.068 --> 02:12:25.929]  The Saudis are involved, our government covers up, we blame Iraq, their archenemy.
[02:12:26.369 --> 02:12:29.830]  Now we blame Syria for the refugees that our attack caused.
[02:12:30.250 --> 02:12:41.633]  I mean, it's just incredibly cut and dry, and only someone with their eyeballs gouged out, their eardrums gouged out, and their tongue cut out could not see what's happening or smell what's happening.
[02:12:41.673 --> 02:12:42.273]  Thank you, Kevin.
[02:12:42.614 --> 02:12:44.614]  James from Canada, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:12:46.255 --> 02:12:47.015]  Uh, hi, hello?
[02:12:47.215 --> 02:12:47.815]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[02:12:49.016 --> 02:12:56.699]  Okay, hey, just quickly for all the Minnesotans, we got about six inches of ice up here in Winnipeg on the Red River, and Lake Winnipeg's almost frozen, so you can fish right away.
[02:12:56.719 --> 02:12:57.399]  Just two points.
[02:12:58.219 --> 02:13:00.780]  I think you guys should really check out the new season of South Park.
[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:02.861]  You had that snippet of the Family Guy episode.
[02:13:03.181 --> 02:13:05.602]  South Park season totally destroyed the PC narrative.
[02:13:06.002 --> 02:13:07.223]  It was really great television.
[02:13:07.243 --> 02:13:13.365]  I don't normally watch South Park, though I've got to admit that the Cayenne West gay fish thing is pretty good.
[02:13:14.145 --> 02:13:17.488]  I like a little bit of cayenne pepper on my eggs, so I do watch that.
[02:13:18.009 --> 02:13:20.351]  Folks, I know his name's not Cayenne, it's a joke.
[02:13:20.651 --> 02:13:21.833]  People say, it's Kanye.
[02:13:22.173 --> 02:13:22.834]  Oh, really?
[02:13:22.854 --> 02:13:24.555]  I butcher names on purpose.
[02:13:25.396 --> 02:13:27.758]  So expanding on that, it's one of my little jokes I do.
[02:13:28.579 --> 02:13:29.961]  I have seen a couple episodes of it.
[02:13:30.021 --> 02:13:32.023]  I mean, there's so much cussing, I can't let my kids watch it.
[02:13:32.943 --> 02:13:35.886]  But still, they kind of act like it's okay at the end.
[02:13:36.787 --> 02:13:40.328]  So I think it's kind of a mixed message, but yes, it is pretty hilarious.
[02:13:40.368 --> 02:13:53.373]  I've seen two episodes where Caitlyn Jenner is always running people over, and it's beautiful, and it's stunning, and it's brave, and you've got the PC police principal that's beating everyone up, and a total tyrant, and you know, totally oppressive, and they're using it to oppress people.
[02:13:54.273 --> 02:14:00.015]  So yes, it is dead on when it comes to that, but it's not strong enough in how dangerous it is.
[02:14:00.035 --> 02:14:02.496]  I appreciate your point on it.
[02:14:02.516 --> 02:14:02.916]  Anything else?
[02:14:04.412 --> 02:14:07.354]  Uh, well yeah, just the last episode I think really codifies what you were saying.
[02:14:07.394 --> 02:14:13.739]  But yeah, my last point is, um, for all the Americans, get on the conservative bandwagon like your former guest from yesterday, Tommy, said.
[02:14:14.259 --> 02:14:17.081]  Uh, we totally missed the conservative bandwagon up here in Canada.
[02:14:17.101 --> 02:14:20.443]  We elected the son of the worst socialist to ever get into our government.
[02:14:20.804 --> 02:14:23.566]  You know, Pierre Elliott Trudeau was just a total bad person.
[02:14:23.686 --> 02:14:24.086]  Look him up.
[02:14:24.106 --> 02:14:25.867]  But yeah, get on this conservative bandwagon.
[02:14:25.887 --> 02:14:30.971]  Trump won't be a constitutionally libertarian president, but he is damn better than anything else you guys are gonna have.
[02:14:30.991 --> 02:14:32.992]  I appreciate your call, James.
[02:14:34.389 --> 02:14:42.171]  When Bush was in power and the Patriot Act and the tyranny in the NSA, I was constantly attacking him and the Democrats coming after our guns.
[02:14:43.391 --> 02:14:47.693]  Now, if the Democrats were in power now doing all this, which they are, I would be against them.
[02:14:48.053 --> 02:14:51.554]  If the Republicans were in power, which they're not right now, I would be against them.
[02:14:52.454 --> 02:14:56.375]  And I'm against all the rhinos and neocons and, you know, John Boehner types.
[02:14:58.257 --> 02:15:00.938]  But the system is coming after the Tea Party.
[02:15:01.338 --> 02:15:03.179]  The system is coming after the real Tea Party.
[02:15:03.219 --> 02:15:04.200]  They tried to co-opt it.
[02:15:04.460 --> 02:15:05.420]  They tried to demonize it.
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:07.141]  They say Homeland Security is for it.
[02:15:08.141 --> 02:15:14.764]  They are afraid of a libertarian movement at least getting some type of debate going in the House and in the Senate, in the Congress.
[02:15:16.185 --> 02:15:25.709]  And their entire defense is set around Republicans and Democratic donors at the top giving money to defeat basically the Ron Paul type movement in Congress.
[02:15:27.073 --> 02:15:30.455]  And you got a Rand Paul, you got a Ted Cruz trying to act like they're the heirs to that.
[02:15:30.615 --> 02:15:31.295]  I hope they are.
[02:15:31.495 --> 02:15:32.376]  They're better than Hillary Clinton.
[02:15:32.396 --> 02:15:33.016]  They're not perfect.
[02:15:33.396 --> 02:15:38.960]  You got a Donald Trump who I don't completely trust, but overall has one of the better shots of winning.
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:41.661]  He's being demonized for saying things that Jimmy Carter did.
[02:15:41.681 --> 02:15:47.724]  Jimmy Carter stopped certain Muslim groups from coming in and kicked people out of the country during that whole situation.
[02:15:48.445 --> 02:15:52.587]  Until they fix the problem with the visas and the rest of it, he's right, in my view.
[02:15:52.807 --> 02:15:54.148]  It's not that radical of a statement.
[02:15:55.199 --> 02:16:01.565]  What is radical is not screening any of these people, letting them come in, knowing they're going to have some attackers, then taking our freedoms.
[02:16:02.166 --> 02:16:03.247]  That is a false flag.
[02:16:04.915 --> 02:16:11.016]  And joining us to discuss this is Wayne Madsen, one of the longest NSA whistleblowers out there.
[02:16:11.056 --> 02:16:14.177]  He did it back when they didn't lock you up for it, like Obama does.
[02:16:14.597 --> 02:16:26.899]  He's also written for some of the biggest publications in the country, and he formerly was in anti-submarine warfare in the Navy, then in the National Security Agency, running actually a whole division of internal security.
[02:16:27.579 --> 02:16:31.300]  And he's exposed the fact that they now use the NSA mainly to spy on government
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:35.881]  Employees who might blow the whistle and on journalists.
[02:16:36.901 --> 02:16:48.385]  And believe me, we've experienced that here where I can be anywhere and the cops just call me up or my reporters get called up and they know exactly where we are, where we're driving through the cell phones without a warrant.
[02:16:49.545 --> 02:16:51.526]  What are you doing up there investigating Islamaburg?
[02:16:52.246 --> 02:16:53.907]  We know you're at the corner of such and such and such.
[02:16:54.147 --> 02:16:54.667]  How do you know that?
[02:16:54.727 --> 02:16:55.467]  We just know.
[02:16:56.867 --> 02:16:58.708]  There's some concerns you might be violent.
[02:16:59.918 --> 02:17:03.801]  Oh, but the Jihadville openly connected in the past to serious stuff.
[02:17:03.821 --> 02:17:05.522]  They're okay, you see.
[02:17:05.542 --> 02:17:07.083]  And oh, nobody can track them.
[02:17:07.103 --> 02:17:09.284]  And oh, the governors don't know where they're going.
[02:17:09.304 --> 02:17:10.365]  They just release them.
[02:17:11.260 --> 02:17:17.185]  I'm going to skip this network break here, this only one, because I want to be able to give Wayne Madsen more time.
[02:17:17.645 --> 02:17:32.057]  Wayne, there's a lot of big news you're about to break today on 2016, a lot of big stuff happening, but overall, what do you think the big strategy is flooding Europe, flooding the U.S., doing no screening, letting plane loads of people from Latin America land and just walk through in front of everyone?
[02:17:32.077 --> 02:17:35.020]  I mean, is this just rubbing our noses in it?
[02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:38.722]  This La La Land or is it the breakdown of government?
[02:17:39.563 --> 02:17:44.566]  What is Obama thinking for two days ordering the FBI to say San Bernardino wasn't terror?
[02:17:45.506 --> 02:17:48.048]  It finally blows up in his face, he's got to go on TV.
[02:17:48.829 --> 02:17:52.731]  The Russians are exposing the whole narrative that our government and others are running ISIS.
[02:17:52.771 --> 02:17:53.712]  That's blowing up.
[02:17:54.812 --> 02:18:00.916]  I mean, are we seeing the collapse of the narrative here with top generals coming out saying we were ordered to run Al-Qaeda and ISIS?
[02:18:01.256 --> 02:18:09.361]  I mean, these are devastating announcements being made and huge investigations in Congress starting up and Inspector General investigations.
[02:18:09.942 --> 02:18:13.684]  This looks like something that could really bring down a large wing of the globalists.
[02:18:14.004 --> 02:18:14.885]  Where do you see this going?
[02:18:14.905 --> 02:18:17.386]  What's the inside baseball up on Capitol Hill?
[02:18:17.446 --> 02:18:17.987]  Wayne Madsen.
[02:18:19.008 --> 02:18:36.083]  Well, I think what's going on, and you mentioned what's going on on the southern border with, again, it's this George Soros-led operation to basically destabilize not only Europe, but also now Central America, the Caribbean.
[02:18:37.184 --> 02:18:44.711]  Soros' social media that he has a lot of say in is now being used to convince a lot of Cubans, look, there's
[02:18:45.151 --> 02:18:50.155]  Relations with the U.S., go to Ecuador, go to Central America, and make your way to the United States.
[02:18:50.615 --> 02:19:02.503]  Because guys like Marco Rubio, of course, will welcome you with open arms, and you'll get, you know, a credit card, food stamps, driver's license, you know, nirvana in America.
[02:19:02.544 --> 02:19:08.688]  The same thing is playing out in Europe, of course, where Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor,
[02:19:09.048 --> 02:19:09.729]  We're good to go.
[02:19:27.708 --> 02:19:35.670]  And has been for a long time, has been a CIA operation, going back to the mighty Wurlitzer days of Frank Wisner.
[02:19:36.370 --> 02:19:38.651]  Let me briefly inject and just back you up on that.
[02:19:39.011 --> 02:19:43.992]  They admit that the Nobel Prize is now a joke, giving Henry Kissinger and Al Gore and others it.
[02:19:44.413 --> 02:19:46.153]  Even the committee admits they've made mistakes.
[02:19:46.553 --> 02:19:47.233]  It's too late.
[02:19:47.273 --> 02:19:48.754]  You've now used it as toilet paper.
[02:19:48.834 --> 02:19:49.634]  It is now a joke.
[02:19:50.114 --> 02:19:54.757]  It's like giving a Pulitzer Prize to, you know, an Obama speech writer about Obamacare being free.
[02:19:55.257 --> 02:19:56.118]  It's a fraud.
[02:19:56.478 --> 02:19:59.820]  And so, yeah, Time Magazine is an admitted fraud with almost no circulation.
[02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:03.062]  So aren't they just putting final nails in their own coffin?
[02:20:04.103 --> 02:20:04.983]  I would hope so.
[02:20:05.163 --> 02:20:15.790]  I mean, as far as Merkel wearing that as a badge of honor, being named Person of the Year by Time, Adolf Hitler was named twice Man of the Year by Time Magazine.
[02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:18.492]  So I wouldn't, I wouldn't, if I were
[02:20:19.872 --> 02:20:26.696]  Frau Merkel, I call her House Frau Merkel, because this lady, you know, I mean, she's obviously been inserted.
[02:20:26.776 --> 02:20:32.779]  She's not qualified to run a German beer hall, let alone a country.
[02:20:32.859 --> 02:20:44.305]  But these are the kinds of people, the Soros's of the world, and these other democracy engineers, quote-unquote, they like to see, the people that carry their water.
[02:20:45.555 --> 02:20:48.558]  And she's declared civil emergency and banned protests all over Germany.
[02:20:48.598 --> 02:20:49.939]  I mean, she is kind of Hitler.
[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:55.824]  Yeah, not only that, but you know, remember we were told that there was no such thing as Sharia zones?
[02:20:57.145 --> 02:20:59.367]  You know, and they said, oh, that's a fantasy.
[02:20:59.427 --> 02:21:04.772]  That fake site called Snopes.com said, oh, no, that's a fake story.
[02:21:05.132 --> 02:21:06.514]  Well, in Germany, there are.
[02:21:07.074 --> 02:21:17.497]  Sharia police zones now where these Sharia cops are coming up to Germans on the street, native Germans, and telling them how to dress, women how to dress.
[02:21:18.177 --> 02:21:23.499]  And there was a big brouhaha, you know, during Oktoberfest.
[02:21:24.099 --> 02:21:25.280]  We're good to go.
[02:21:39.367 --> 02:21:44.910]  You find the Germans are charged with hooliganism and xenophobia.
[02:21:44.930 --> 02:21:48.713]  And that's what's playing out all through Europe now.
[02:21:49.033 --> 02:21:50.814]  They've got a huge problem over there.
[02:21:50.834 --> 02:21:54.936]  And a public health problem.
[02:21:55.697 --> 02:21:57.838]  They've got these radical cells.
[02:21:57.978 --> 02:22:06.263]  I have a story up today about 10 towns in Albania and the radical mosques have under the nose of NATO.
[02:22:06.483 --> 02:22:07.884]  Albania is a NATO country.
[02:22:07.944 --> 02:22:09.965]  We're good to go.
[02:22:27.711 --> 02:22:36.731]  What is it about the kleptocratic left and the right wing that works with them that they really do seem like they want to bankrupt and wreck the West?
[02:22:36.751 --> 02:22:38.274]  I mean, why would you want to bring in...
[02:22:39.764 --> 02:22:44.105]  Third-world radical Sunni populations that can't even get along with each other.
[02:22:44.125 --> 02:22:49.026]  I mean, they're not bringing in non-radical Muslim groups that integrate quite nicely.
[02:22:49.586 --> 02:22:57.388]  Our government has a long-term policy of wrecking secular governments, whether it be Mohammed Mozadek or Qaddafi or Saddam Hussein.
[02:22:57.428 --> 02:23:02.649]  They demonize them and then lionize the most demonic groups you can imagine, like Saudi Arabia.
[02:23:03.632 --> 02:23:04.072]  That's right.
[02:23:04.113 --> 02:23:18.927]  We've already had, in German migrant camps, rioting breaking out between Afghans, who have been really radicalized with the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and more moderate Syrian refugees.
[02:23:19.327 --> 02:23:27.815]  You know, moderate as in quotes, because there's degrees of moderation among these migrants coming from these countries.
[02:23:28.396 --> 02:23:29.617]  Yeah, we're seeing it play out.
[02:23:29.677 --> 02:23:39.881]  So, I mean, Syrians and Afghans have never really had to mix in their own countries, but they're being forced to live with each other in these camps in Germany.
[02:23:39.941 --> 02:23:47.564]  And, of course, rioting is breaking out because the Syrians don't really think the real radical Afghans are their cup of tea.
[02:23:50.245 --> 02:23:53.066]  Why are we seeing so many leftists and feminist groups and others
[02:23:54.230 --> 02:24:03.800]  Worshipping and making it sexy, radical Islam and MSNBC having more and more of their pundits wearing headdresses, hijabs on television.
[02:24:04.220 --> 02:24:09.325]  What's the whole point of that when radical Islam is the most oppressive force against women I think we've ever seen?
[02:24:10.279 --> 02:24:12.561]  Yes, to push this multiculturalism.
[02:24:12.601 --> 02:24:20.788]  You know, the idea is that the migrants shouldn't become like Germans or French or Danes or Swedes or Norwegians.
[02:24:21.488 --> 02:24:37.322]  That those countries should respect these 13th century rituals and this culture that these migrants are bringing into these democratically advanced countries in Europe and also in North America.
[02:24:37.722 --> 02:24:38.983]  But yeah, you're right.
[02:24:39.083 --> 02:24:46.929]  It's part of the Soros and this other agenda because what Soros does is he actually thrives on chaos.
[02:24:47.689 --> 02:24:48.910]  Chaos is good for him.
[02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:50.531]  I've written this.
[02:24:50.751 --> 02:24:55.094]  He'd make the perfect James Bond villain because he's everywhere around the world.
[02:24:55.555 --> 02:25:07.203]  And so when he backs somebody like this Eurovision winner, this Conchita Wurst, which is an Austrian cross-dresser,
[02:25:07.723 --> 02:25:12.448]  With a beard and breasts.
[02:25:12.668 --> 02:25:18.574]  I mean, this is the type of person that people like Soros hold up as examples.
[02:25:18.614 --> 02:25:23.559]  That and Femin and this other group of women and I won't mention their name.
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:29.085]  Again, they talk about women's rights, yet one of their
[02:25:29.625 --> 02:25:44.837]  Their most hallowed singing groups is this group of women, they were really trollops, who use as part of their name a crude and crass name for female anatomy.
[02:25:45.717 --> 02:25:47.999]  Well, it's purely to destabilize culture.
[02:25:48.059 --> 02:25:49.120]  Soros admits that.
[02:25:49.660 --> 02:25:56.085]  He told 60 Minutes 15 years ago, he said, I'm not ashamed of what I did, rounding people up for Nazi Germany.
[02:25:56.245 --> 02:25:57.026]  It made me survive.
[02:25:59.585 --> 02:26:05.211]  Yes, and he's been backing all of Obama's initiatives, and he's backing Hillary.
[02:26:06.172 --> 02:26:20.007]  He was behind the scenes during Bill Clinton's administration, and he's there under Obama, and if Hillary Clinton's elected president, he'll be right there still, practicing his political alchemy.
[02:26:21.328 --> 02:26:23.589]  Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com joins us.
[02:26:23.609 --> 02:26:24.409]  He's also an author.
[02:26:24.449 --> 02:26:25.349]  You can find his books there.
[02:26:25.769 --> 02:26:30.051]  He also is a reporter, roving reporter for InfoWars.com.
[02:26:30.531 --> 02:26:35.893]  Now, I want to go to phone calls in the next segment and cover some other issues.
[02:26:35.913 --> 02:26:36.533]  800-259-9231 is the number.
[02:26:36.893 --> 02:26:39.014]  Any subject's fine because Wayne can speak to all of them.
[02:26:40.515 --> 02:26:43.201]  Other areas you're looking into, some of the other stories.
[02:26:43.241 --> 02:26:46.568]  I know you're looking at some of the latest sex scandals with some of the candidates.
[02:26:46.908 --> 02:26:48.512]  You're looking at some other big issues.
[02:26:48.552 --> 02:26:51.197]  What are some of those topics you're about to tell us about?
[02:26:51.943 --> 02:27:12.188]  Well, Marco Rubio has got to be one of the luckiest guys in the world because just as it was getting ready to break about his extramarital affair with a lobbyist, a well-known lobbyist in Washington, Donald Trump, of course, makes this comment about Muslims and it's all over, of course, the news cycle.
[02:27:12.848 --> 02:27:27.789]  And I was looking into this Rubio report, and so was the mainstream media, but then of course Trump, his comments, no pun intended, trumped the Rubio story.
[02:27:28.610 --> 02:27:42.474]  I find it interesting that all of a sudden the Tampa Bay Times and other newspapers are running a report about Rubio's brother-in-law being a well-known convicted international narcotics dealer.
[02:27:42.534 --> 02:27:44.255]  Well, this is actually an old story.
[02:27:44.275 --> 02:27:47.436]  Yeah, I mean that means he fits in nicely with the Bushes and the Clintons then.
[02:27:48.246 --> 02:27:48.986]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:27:49.026 --> 02:28:01.531]  Look, you know, if there were journalists down in Miami at the Miami Herald that were like the old-time journalists, Marco Rubio would have never gotten elected to the school board or a dog catcher.
[02:28:01.891 --> 02:28:10.454]  Because I'm thinking about the old-time journalists were like Rottweilers when they would sink their teeth into a corrupted candidate.
[02:28:10.934 --> 02:28:11.874]  Or a politician.
[02:28:11.914 --> 02:28:12.855]  They wouldn't let go.
[02:28:12.975 --> 02:28:15.296]  Now, these were old school people.
[02:28:15.616 --> 02:28:19.577]  These journalists sometimes kept a flask of whiskey in their desk drawer.
[02:28:19.617 --> 02:28:21.338]  But, you know, they got the job done.
[02:28:21.838 --> 02:28:22.918]  And we don't have that.
[02:28:22.958 --> 02:28:37.743]  You turn on these 24 by 7 news channels and you think you're at some sort of wine and cheese party for a bunch of members of the ACLU and PETA.
[02:28:38.063 --> 02:28:43.209]  Yeah, you're going to think you're one of these wine tasting deals that discuss body parts sales and the rest of it.
[02:28:43.269 --> 02:28:43.849]  Absolutely.
[02:28:44.770 --> 02:28:49.816]  I mean, Rubio, do you think this could bring him down or is he even a contender now?
[02:28:50.694 --> 02:28:58.879]  Well, I think, you know, the deal on Rubio is he's come out as the establishment candidate.
[02:28:59.260 --> 02:29:03.943]  Now, the word is that it's Jeb Bush and Karl Rove that are behind going after Rubio.
[02:29:03.983 --> 02:29:06.565]  Remember, Jeb said, look, he's now fair game.
[02:29:06.585 --> 02:29:09.186]  They used to be buddies, but Jeb said he's fair game.
[02:29:09.226 --> 02:29:17.792]  So, I guess in Bush's mind that if he can bring down Rubio, he'll pick up all the Rubio supporters.
[02:29:17.832 --> 02:29:18.433]  Yeah, the Florida.
[02:29:19.193 --> 02:29:20.154]  The Florida people.
[02:29:20.194 --> 02:29:23.619]  But a lot of people in Florida do not like Jeb Bush.
[02:29:23.659 --> 02:29:26.082]  So I don't think the Rubio supporters will go.
[02:29:26.102 --> 02:29:26.683]  Well that's right.
[02:29:26.883 --> 02:29:29.727]  In fact, Jeb said by December 15th Trump would be done.
[02:29:30.468 --> 02:29:30.888]  Months ago.
[02:29:30.928 --> 02:29:31.549]  That hasn't happened.
[02:29:31.569 --> 02:29:33.511]  I want to come back and ask you your take on Trump.
[02:29:33.892 --> 02:29:35.314]  Your real view on him.
[02:29:35.354 --> 02:29:35.935]  Don't mince words.
[02:29:35.995 --> 02:29:36.676]  Obviously you wouldn't.
[02:29:37.196 --> 02:29:38.017]  But, I mean, is he good?
[02:29:38.077 --> 02:29:38.537]  Is he bad?
[02:29:38.577 --> 02:29:39.157]  Is he a mix?
[02:29:39.838 --> 02:29:49.265]  I want to get Wayne Madsen's view on Trump and Ted Cruz as well as he takes the lead in Iowa ahead of the big CNN debate tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:29:49.505 --> 02:29:55.149]  We're going to be covering it live, play-by-play, from the InfoWars News Center in Austin, Texas.
[02:29:55.869 --> 02:29:58.671]  Find listings and the free fees at InfoWars.com forward slash 2016.
[02:29:58.851 --> 02:29:59.732]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.252 --> 02:30:01.833]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.774 --> 02:30:05.456]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:19.527]  The LAPD and private security are targeting random people with stop-and-frisk searches on public sidewalks before the premiere of Star Wars The Force Awakens.
[02:30:19.807 --> 02:30:26.452]  Police have also installed metal detectors on the sidewalks near the famous TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood, California.
[02:30:27.012 --> 02:30:30.875]  Someone took to Twitter to post a picture of a Wookiee having his back searched.
[02:30:31.095 --> 02:30:35.718]  The caption reads, security will be tight for the latest hashtag Star Wars premiere tonight.
[02:30:35.978 --> 02:30:37.560]  Metal detectors have been set up.
[02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:48.889]  TMZ reported, LAPD and private security officers are already blanketing several square blocks around the famed Chinese theater where the Force Awakens event is going down.
[02:30:49.229 --> 02:30:54.974]  We've learned anyone strolling through the area could be searched, frisked, and even wanted with metal detectors.
[02:30:55.394 --> 02:31:02.780]  In other words, even people not associated with the event who are simply passing through a public area are subject to a warrantless search.
[02:31:03.341 --> 02:31:06.904]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[02:31:09.628 --> 02:31:12.831]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:13.131 --> 02:31:21.157]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:21.378 --> 02:31:26.402]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:31:26.802 --> 02:31:29.084]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:31:29.324 --> 02:31:31.125]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:31:39.600 --> 02:31:43.801]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[02:31:43.981 --> 02:31:47.943]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[02:31:48.123 --> 02:31:52.904]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[02:31:53.064 --> 02:31:57.606]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[02:31:57.726 --> 02:32:01.067]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:32:01.207 --> 02:32:04.528]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:04.668 --> 02:32:06.488]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:32:09.309 --> 02:32:19.076]  My fellow patriots, one of the things I'm most proud of is the fact that the InfoWars operation reaches more than 20 million people a week, worldwide, with the message of liberty.
[02:32:19.336 --> 02:32:23.479]  And none of it is funded by major global corporations or by taxpayers.
[02:32:23.899 --> 02:32:25.460]  It's funded by free will.
[02:32:25.740 --> 02:32:35.026]  Listeners and viewers like you who decide to visit InfoWarsStore.com and take advantage of some of the most high-quality, revolutionary products available today.
[02:32:35.386 --> 02:32:38.308]  And now, until December 18th, 2015, we are extending
[02:32:39.229 --> 02:32:39.910]  We're good.
[02:33:13.689 --> 02:33:16.510]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak.
[02:33:16.530 --> 02:33:17.470]  Let me think, just let me think.
[02:33:17.490 --> 02:33:23.191]  I suspect even now orders are being shouts into telephones and men with guns will still be on their way.
[02:33:23.231 --> 02:33:25.092]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[02:33:25.112 --> 02:33:25.252]  Damn it!
[02:33:25.292 --> 02:33:25.612]  Why?
[02:33:26.352 --> 02:33:32.313]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[02:33:32.933 --> 02:33:35.674]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will
[02:33:38.876 --> 02:33:43.700]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:44.701]  You designed it, sir.
[02:33:44.761 --> 02:33:45.682]  You wanted it foolproof.
[02:33:45.702 --> 02:33:47.083]  You taught me every television in London!
[02:33:47.343 --> 02:33:50.846]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[02:33:51.246 --> 02:34:00.894]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and subverting your submission.
[02:34:00.914 --> 02:34:01.054]  Cameras.
[02:34:01.094 --> 02:34:01.795]  We need cameras.
[02:34:02.095 --> 02:34:02.816]  How did this happen?
[02:34:03.556 --> 02:34:04.297]  Who's to blame?
[02:34:05.259 --> 02:34:07.925]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[02:34:07.945 --> 02:34:09.849]  They will be held accountable.
[02:34:09.869 --> 02:34:15.741]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[02:34:16.937 --> 02:34:18.698]  I know why you did it.
[02:34:18.918 --> 02:34:19.999]  I know you were afraid.
[02:34:20.019 --> 02:34:22.221]  Who wouldn't be?
[02:34:22.621 --> 02:34:22.801]  War?
[02:34:22.841 --> 02:34:22.981]  Terror?
[02:34:23.061 --> 02:34:23.702]  Disease?
[02:34:24.342 --> 02:34:30.206]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[02:34:30.806 --> 02:34:32.247]  Fear got the best of you.
[02:34:32.607 --> 02:34:37.090]  And in your panic, you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[02:34:37.110 --> 02:34:38.251]  He promised you order.
[02:34:38.291 --> 02:34:39.312]  He promised you peace.
[02:34:39.812 --> 02:34:43.354]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[02:34:50.067 --> 02:34:51.327]  There is a war.
[02:34:51.767 --> 02:34:52.728]  It's happening now.
[02:34:53.608 --> 02:34:55.408]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:34:55.988 --> 02:34:57.769]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:34:58.609 --> 02:35:00.049]  We are the resistance.
[02:35:00.509 --> 02:35:02.730]  We are the InfoWars.
[02:35:03.210 --> 02:35:08.271]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Wayne Madsen, InfoWars.com, investigative journalist.
[02:35:08.291 --> 02:35:09.391]  He's riding shotgun with us.
[02:35:09.431 --> 02:35:14.632]  I want to go to James and Marcus and Steve and Mike and Dion and others here in about 5-10 minutes.
[02:35:15.052 --> 02:35:17.873]  But I want to continue with the news and analysis with Wayne Madsen.
[02:35:19.039 --> 02:35:34.274]  First off, this operation, being able to send Wayne Madsen out of the CIA airbase in Arizona, being able to send our reporters to Switzerland to report on Bilderberg, being able to send our reporters to the RNC and DNC coming up this year and next year.
[02:35:35.694 --> 02:35:42.676]  To be able to send our reporters out to cover the radiation on the West Coast first, years ago, which they now admit mainstream news is exactly as we said.
[02:35:43.537 --> 02:35:48.698]  So many times we force stories out into the dinosaur media and that's really our job.
[02:35:49.239 --> 02:35:52.880]  You can see my talking points, my points, becoming mainstream.
[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:53.960]  We're having a big effect.
[02:35:54.821 --> 02:35:55.461]  Thanks to you.
[02:35:56.641 --> 02:36:01.523]  The world now knows criminals run our government and they're running Al Qaeda and others and allowing them to attack us.
[02:36:03.083 --> 02:36:04.584]  Hillary and Jeb are in deep trouble.
[02:36:04.864 --> 02:36:06.605]  And of course that's not all Infowars.
[02:36:06.665 --> 02:36:08.146]  It's many other groups and organizations.
[02:36:09.827 --> 02:36:11.648]  But we are a radicalizing force.
[02:36:12.689 --> 02:36:14.550]  The truth is we've been very on our back.
[02:36:14.610 --> 02:36:15.871]  We've been very lazy.
[02:36:15.891 --> 02:36:17.492]  We've been in a trance as a people.
[02:36:18.092 --> 02:36:18.852]  We've had it pretty good.
[02:36:19.573 --> 02:36:21.714]  And now as tyranny comes in, folks are starting to wake up.
[02:36:22.695 --> 02:36:26.597]  So when I say I'm here to radicalize you, I'm just here to get you awake and taking action.
[02:36:26.797 --> 02:36:31.580]  And the globalists see that as radical because they truly are radical criminals usurping and enslaving us.
[02:36:33.584 --> 02:36:37.107]  And to fund ourselves, I've had to be inventive.
[02:36:37.147 --> 02:36:38.969]  I've had to discover what people really want.
[02:36:39.009 --> 02:36:40.510]  I've had to research what I really like.
[02:36:41.912 --> 02:36:50.340]  I've gone through a lot to get sponsors to fund this operation, to try to pay our people a good wage so they can be focused and take care of their families.
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:55.684]  No one else has been able to build a media operation outside of big establishment money.
[02:36:56.550 --> 02:37:06.333]  And even the biggest radio shows in this country that are on 600 stations don't have one one-fifteenth, because I know the numbers, of our budget.
[02:37:07.553 --> 02:37:09.634]  And we live in a place where it's not very expensive in Texas.
[02:37:09.994 --> 02:37:11.034]  That's helped us do this as well.
[02:37:11.435 --> 02:37:13.895]  I could have maybe 15, 20 employees in New York or LA.
[02:37:13.915 --> 02:37:14.195]  We've got 50.
[02:37:15.316 --> 02:37:22.578]  And we've got contractors and we've got reporters and researchers and customer service and, you know, legal and accounting and we do it all by the book.
[02:37:24.622 --> 02:37:30.268]  And we're exponentially reaching more people, and we're trying to hire more folks, like, you know, bringing Wayne Madsen on, and others.
[02:37:31.669 --> 02:37:47.465]  So, InfoWarsTore.com, you know when you buy high-quality products there, you're not just getting a high-quality product at a very affordable or competitive price, you are also funding a one-of-a-kind operation that gets results in the fight against tyranny.
[02:37:48.564 --> 02:37:51.746]  We don't get NPR money, $450 million a year of taxpayer.
[02:37:52.426 --> 02:37:54.667]  We don't get billions like MSNBC in stimulus money.
[02:37:54.967 --> 02:37:59.910]  We get zero, zero, zero, zero, zero from government funding.
[02:38:01.209 --> 02:38:03.170]  You know, they say, we didn't build our operation.
[02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:05.390]  The people built this operation.
[02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:06.531]  I built this operation.
[02:38:06.791 --> 02:38:08.091]  People's love of liberty built this.
[02:38:08.271 --> 02:38:12.352]  How dare these government-funded institutions sit there and say, you didn't build something.
[02:38:12.372 --> 02:38:13.493]  You didn't pass that test.
[02:38:13.733 --> 02:38:14.833]  You didn't play that song.
[02:38:15.053 --> 02:38:16.214]  You didn't write that poetry.
[02:38:16.554 --> 02:38:17.674]  You didn't plant that garden.
[02:38:17.954 --> 02:38:20.055]  You didn't go make those lunches at school.
[02:38:20.295 --> 02:38:21.455]  You didn't work on that car.
[02:38:21.835 --> 02:38:22.956]  You didn't fix that tooth.
[02:38:23.256 --> 02:38:24.736]  You didn't fix that broken leg.
[02:38:24.936 --> 02:38:26.037]  You didn't write that article.
[02:38:26.817 --> 02:38:29.578]  You didn't go work at the checkout line killing your feet for 12 hours.
[02:38:30.078 --> 02:38:30.738]  I'm sick of it!
[02:38:32.534 --> 02:38:35.215]  And InfoWars was built by we the people.
[02:38:37.215 --> 02:38:41.356]  And we the people are where the real change starts, not the fake globalist change with more tyranny.
[02:38:42.836 --> 02:38:45.997]  So InfoWarsStore.com, free shipping until the 18th.

[02:39:38.965 --> 02:39:40.886]  You talk about turbo charge, this is it.
[02:39:40.946 --> 02:39:45.109]  I take one in the morning, I gotta do like coast to coast AM or something or get to do it, I should say, I love doing it.
[02:39:45.370 --> 02:39:47.951]  I take one of those at about 10 o'clock at night and I'm done by 4 AM.
[02:39:48.692 --> 02:39:53.415]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139 and this is the last week
[02:39:57.738 --> 02:40:01.000]  There may be a few sizes left, but we're not making any more of the Hillary for Prison shirts.
[02:40:01.380 --> 02:40:03.041]  That was something I said would go for four or five months.
[02:40:03.221 --> 02:40:04.902]  It would end in 2015.
[02:40:05.242 --> 02:40:05.602]  It will.
[02:40:06.123 --> 02:40:10.905]  So the Hillary for Prison shirts, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:40:10.925 --> 02:40:11.406]  Wayne Madsen.
[02:40:16.887 --> 02:40:18.609]  I always say this to guests, and especially with you.
[02:40:19.009 --> 02:40:19.930]  I've been all over the board.
[02:40:19.990 --> 02:40:21.652]  I've covered some topics I wanted to get into.
[02:40:21.692 --> 02:40:24.474]  I want to go to some calls with you, but what else is big?
[02:40:24.494 --> 02:40:25.595]  What else are you working on?
[02:40:25.896 --> 02:40:27.337]  What's the next big shoe to drop?
[02:40:28.358 --> 02:40:31.060]  And just overall, how are things going for the new world order right now?
[02:40:31.401 --> 02:40:32.622]  The Syria situation?
[02:40:33.102 --> 02:40:36.285]  I've got to really be proud of what Russia's been doing with the moral high ground.
[02:40:37.326 --> 02:40:39.168]  It looks to me like the globalists are not doing too well.
[02:40:40.526 --> 02:40:54.236]  Well, Russia militarily intervening in Syria basically was their drawing the line in the Syrian sand saying, look, we saw what you did with Libya, that's now a failed state.
[02:40:55.237 --> 02:40:59.660]  We saw what you did with Iraq, that's a failed state.
[02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:05.024]  We saw what you did in our own backyard in Ukraine, and now that's a failed state.
[02:41:05.824 --> 02:41:07.024]  And they just said, that's it.
[02:41:07.604 --> 02:41:09.665]  We aren't going to put up with it anymore.
[02:41:10.125 --> 02:41:15.506]  They basically finally called out Erdogan, the Turkish president, for what he really is.
[02:41:15.566 --> 02:41:21.927]  He's a neo-Ottoman empire, neo-Seljuk emperor.
[02:41:22.628 --> 02:41:28.189]  He wants to restore the old Muslim caliphate.
[02:41:28.629 --> 02:41:34.210]  And of course ISIS, they're his shock troops in Syria and Iraq to carry this out.
[02:41:35.253 --> 02:42:00.878]  So, now there's been some military confrontations between Russia and Turkey, and I think if NATO wants to back a neo-Islamist Ottoman member state and try to have Article 5 invoked, like, you know, a Russian altercation with the Turkish military as if that
[02:42:01.498 --> 02:42:04.319]  Russia, you know, shot an American plane out of the sky.
[02:42:04.959 --> 02:42:18.461]  I think a lot of members of NATO are going to say, no, we didn't sign up to go to war for an egomaniac sociopath like Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president.
[02:42:18.621 --> 02:42:25.583]  It has been over the top how the Russians released all the satellite data, the print of thousands of trucks coming across to his son getting the oil.
[02:42:26.703 --> 02:42:32.888]  Turkey now going into Iraq, threatening Putin, threatening to blow up their ships in the Mediterranean.
[02:42:32.928 --> 02:42:34.589]  This is extremely arrogant behavior.
[02:42:35.563 --> 02:42:45.511]  Yeah, and I think now we see John Kerry in Moscow and he's, remember we tried to freeze out Russia, now we're going hand in hand to the Russians.
[02:42:45.571 --> 02:43:03.605]  The Russians are going to say, we'll talk to you, but it's going to be on our terms, not on the terms of people like Victoria Nuland, this neocon in the State Department that's been trying to not only overthrow, well she was involved in the overthrow of the Ukrainian democratically elected president,
[02:43:03.945 --> 02:43:07.307]  But he's involved in trying to cause problems in Russia itself.
[02:43:09.168 --> 02:43:30.139]  What do you make of just the over-the-top moves of former top generals, like the head of defense intelligence and others, coming out and going, look, we created al-Qaeda, ISIS, we're running this in Syria, we were ordered to by the president, it's conscious, it's bad, we shouldn't be doing it, and the media trying to spin that and now
[02:43:31.297 --> 02:43:36.861]  These investigations, I mean, am I underestimating or overestimating how huge this is?
[02:43:37.741 --> 02:43:51.290]  It's big when you have people that are being fired from their jobs in the military because of what they, and you know, he, General Flynn, you're talking about the former commander of the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[02:43:51.771 --> 02:43:54.152]  You know, he didn't say anything while he was on active duty.
[02:43:54.172 --> 02:43:55.433]  He said this afterwards.
[02:43:55.553 --> 02:44:01.017]  And I would just hope that in the future, these individuals will come back
[02:44:01.777 --> 02:44:06.160]  In government, in positions of authority, and we should be getting rid of it.
[02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:08.661]  We shouldn't even have people like Ashton Carter.
[02:44:09.021 --> 02:44:11.363]  He's a bureaucratic pencil sharpener.
[02:44:11.723 --> 02:44:15.805]  I was about to say, I'm not one of these guys that says let generals run everything and elect a bunch of generals.
[02:44:16.445 --> 02:44:24.210]  But at the same time, to see the military being restraining Obama from wanting to start wars, wanting to back ISIS more openly.
[02:44:25.267 --> 02:44:30.490]  I'm not trying to make the military the heroes, but they have been the restraining force to a great extent.
[02:44:30.530 --> 02:44:31.471]  That's really scary.
[02:44:32.352 --> 02:44:34.093]  Well, I understand what's at stake.
[02:44:34.393 --> 02:44:42.658]  If we go to war on behalf of these Turks against Russia, we're going to have some real problems.
[02:44:43.299 --> 02:44:46.401]  It's not 100 body bags coming back.
[02:44:46.521 --> 02:44:47.201]  Think in terms of 10,000.
[02:44:48.602 --> 02:44:48.922]  I don't
[02:45:04.150 --> 02:45:08.374]  Dechristianize a country, kill hundreds of thousands of Christians, blow up every church they find.
[02:45:08.994 --> 02:45:12.818]  Why would our elite want to do something like this to a country that did nothing to us?
[02:45:13.158 --> 02:45:21.025]  Why would they want to set Gaddafi up after eight years of him investing in Europe, doing whatever he was told, getting rid of his weapons, letting the West in, letting all the U.S.
[02:45:21.125 --> 02:45:27.010]  companies come in, and then they literally bring in Al Qaeda and set him up and murder him, and then Hillary makes jokes about it.
[02:45:27.847 --> 02:45:32.871]  Yeah, and you know, our good friends the Saudis pulled a fast one yesterday.
[02:45:32.932 --> 02:45:39.938]  They announced the formation of like a 36 member country Islamic military alliance.
[02:45:40.038 --> 02:45:45.403]  Now a lot of these countries are in Africa and they have as many Christians living there as they do Muslims.
[02:45:45.863 --> 02:45:54.591]  And I think this is just a means by the Saudis to try to introduce yet more radical jihadists into countries like Senegal,
[02:45:55.231 --> 02:46:01.055]  And the Ivory Coast, and Gabon, and spread the influence of Boko Haram.
[02:46:01.095 --> 02:46:04.417]  Because whatever the Saudis say, you gotta look at the opposite.
[02:46:04.837 --> 02:46:15.724]  And I was actually happy that not only Donald Trump said, you know, the Saudis and the Turks are backing ISIL, but he said there's other countries doing it as well.
[02:46:16.664 --> 02:46:22.107]  He didn't name the other one, but he said I can't get into it because I have business dealings.
[02:46:22.548 --> 02:46:32.874]  I think it's pretty clear the other country he mentioned was Israel, and I just wish he would get his facts right about the people celebrating 9-11 in North Jersey were not Muslims.
[02:46:33.274 --> 02:46:37.076]  They weren't a lot of them, but they were in key locations.
[02:46:37.096 --> 02:46:37.837]  They were Israeli
[02:46:38.577 --> 02:46:41.600]  Citizens, Mossad agents, dressed up as Arabs.
[02:46:41.640 --> 02:46:45.164]  That's what I found when I spent two months in that area.
[02:46:45.184 --> 02:46:58.016]  And not only, we've talked to some of the police officers, that's what they thought, but over in the Middle East there was some celebrating and there has been celebrating, you know, at the sports stadiums and stuff, but you are right about that being a mixed situation, probably what, a psychological warfare operation?
[02:46:58.556 --> 02:47:09.698]  Yeah, when they were caught, they were caught with money, they were caught with Arab dress, they were caught with traces of explosives in their vans, they used a moving system, urban moving systems vans.
[02:47:10.579 --> 02:47:16.980]  So, they were the ones who were seen at Liberty State Park dressed as Arabs celebrating.
[02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:25.302]  That same group was caught later on that afternoon and the FBI and the police confiscated their Israeli passports.
[02:47:25.882 --> 02:47:26.903]  Wow, super heavy.
[02:47:27.603 --> 02:47:29.164]  Donald Trump overall, what do you think about him?
[02:47:29.204 --> 02:47:30.005]  I want to go to some calls.
[02:47:30.985 --> 02:47:35.608]  You know, it's very rare we see these populist candidates catch fire.
[02:47:35.728 --> 02:47:45.894]  I remember 1968 we saw with George Wallace, who started to really not only have an impact in the South, he had the South, but he started to make an impact up North.
[02:47:45.954 --> 02:47:48.596]  People may not remember, but he won
[02:47:49.196 --> 02:47:49.477]  I don't
[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:10.985]  So, these were not his natural constituencies, but people wanted to hear his populist message.
[02:48:11.025 --> 02:48:13.907]  We saw it again with Ross Perot in 92.
[02:48:13.967 --> 02:48:18.391]  Again, somebody who had a lot of money at his disposal, like Trump does.
[02:48:18.751 --> 02:48:23.655]  His message started to catch on, but then we had him pull out of the race.
[02:48:23.935 --> 02:48:25.076]  He was running around 33% as an independent.
[02:48:27.037 --> 02:48:29.878]  And then he accused George H.W.
[02:48:29.938 --> 02:48:34.720]  Bush of trying to sabotage his family and he pulled out and that was the end of his campaign.
[02:48:34.740 --> 02:48:50.266]  I would suspect that many of the people we're seeing or many of the symptoms of this country where we see Trump getting a lot of support were also manifested in the support for Perot.
[02:48:51.706 --> 02:48:57.209]  In 92, and Wallace in 68, because people are fed up with the two major parties.
[02:48:57.850 --> 02:48:59.130]  And it's the same people.
[02:48:59.430 --> 02:49:00.911]  You want Bush, you want Clinton.
[02:49:01.932 --> 02:49:04.473]  Oh, if you don't want them, well, maybe we'll bring back Romney.
[02:49:05.314 --> 02:49:06.614]  Oh, how about Lindsey Graham?
[02:49:06.674 --> 02:49:09.856]  You know, I mean, these people, we've seen them.
[02:49:09.876 --> 02:49:14.879]  Sure, so what do you particularly yourself think about Trump, and where do you, in your gut, think he's going?
[02:49:16.192 --> 02:49:21.454]  Well, I think he's playing the spoiler like we see with a lot of these populist candidates.
[02:49:22.334 --> 02:49:23.434]  We'll see what happens.
[02:49:23.534 --> 02:49:26.135]  I mean, there's already talk of a brokered convention.
[02:49:26.715 --> 02:49:36.618]  That's the graybeards in the Republican Party, the elitists, talking about maybe picking a candidate behind closed doors in Cleveland.
[02:49:36.998 --> 02:49:38.519]  And having the delegates all vote for it.
[02:49:39.079 --> 02:49:45.084]  Yeah, I would imagine in that case we'll see Trump walk out, maybe declare he's going to run as an independent.
[02:49:45.124 --> 02:49:47.526]  It might be kind of late in the game to get on ballots.
[02:49:47.566 --> 02:49:55.893]  It's very hard, for example, in Virginia and Texas to get on ballots for presidential races, but we may see something like that occur.
[02:49:55.913 --> 02:50:04.981]  I don't think he's going away, even though people like Bush and some of these others would like to see him go away.
[02:50:05.816 --> 02:50:15.787]  Doesn't Trump have an ace of spades card that if he does leave with a third party from the Republicans, if they try to steal the nomination from him, that that would probably ensure Hillary won?
[02:50:16.581 --> 02:50:20.662]  Yeah, he'll play the same spoiler role that Perot played in 92.
[02:50:21.042 --> 02:50:26.543]  There's nothing about Trump, you know, he's been vetted by the tabloids ever since the 80s.
[02:50:26.603 --> 02:50:32.765]  I remember seeing articles about Trump in People Magazine with all, you know, his celebrity status.
[02:50:32.785 --> 02:50:37.466]  So the celebrity-focused media and the tabloids have pretty well vetted him.
[02:50:37.486 --> 02:50:39.566]  We know about all his ex-wives and all that.
[02:50:39.926 --> 02:50:43.307]  So there's nothing more there, in my opinion, that can be
[02:50:44.087 --> 02:50:46.148]  So he is the Ace of Spades in this election.
[02:50:46.208 --> 02:50:47.228]  He will decide it, probably.
[02:50:47.489 --> 02:50:52.670]  Yeah, not like Rubio, where his high-heeled shoes are dropping all over on Rubio right now.
[02:50:53.351 --> 02:51:07.976]  And his family's not only involved in drug dealing, but also in maybe one of his brother-in-laws, the guy he worked for, the drug cartel leader, may have an ATF agent.
[02:51:07.996 --> 02:51:08.857]  Wow, let's stay there.
[02:51:08.897 --> 02:51:09.697]  Come back with calls.
[02:51:10.376 --> 02:51:13.560]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?

[02:54:12.737 --> 02:54:14.198]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:54:14.218 --> 02:54:14.918]  to 3 p.m.
[02:54:14.938 --> 02:54:15.999]  broadcast worldwide.
[02:54:16.019 --> 02:54:21.082]  The 4th Hour, sometimes hosted by me, but a lot of times by our great hosts and anchors in investigative journeys.
[02:54:21.162 --> 02:54:25.224]  The one, the only, Jakari Jackson will be hosting the 4th Hour today.
[02:54:26.105 --> 02:54:29.387]  And I heard his report earlier and then looked it up, and sure enough, it's incredible.
[02:54:29.827 --> 02:54:34.950]  They're starting stop-and-frisk tactics, not just in California at movie theaters, but all over the country.
[02:54:35.270 --> 02:54:37.652]  And George Lucas came out and said, don't bring toy guns.
[02:54:37.672 --> 02:54:39.393]  A lot of the Star Wars folks do that.
[02:54:40.353 --> 02:54:41.174]  It's super nerdly.
[02:54:41.314 --> 02:54:43.077]  I almost want to get into it because it's so stupid.
[02:54:43.097 --> 02:54:47.863]  And just, you know, don't bring the toy guns or stormtrooper outfits, I guess.
[02:54:48.504 --> 02:54:52.510]  And so talk about a nation going into bondage and cowardice and slavery.
[02:54:52.790 --> 02:54:53.671]  They bring in the radicals.
[02:54:53.691 --> 02:54:54.552]  They let them attack us.
[02:54:55.153 --> 02:54:55.393]  And then.
[02:54:56.698 --> 02:54:59.059]  They're going to have police with metal detectors all over the place.
[02:54:59.439 --> 02:55:03.401]  This was the plan with Homeland Security more than a decade ago, was to have checkpoints everywhere.
[02:55:03.781 --> 02:55:05.922]  And now they're starting that with the Viper teams and more.
[02:55:06.703 --> 02:55:09.924]  Joe Biggs with reports of strange activities at public schools.
[02:55:10.345 --> 02:55:13.886]  State of emergency has been declared in Michigan because children have high amounts of lead in their blood.
[02:55:14.286 --> 02:55:17.048]  Gun grabbers are pushing no fly, no buy.
[02:55:17.768 --> 02:55:20.011]  Joe Biggs will be sitting in with him as one of his guests.
[02:55:20.051 --> 02:55:21.854]  That's all coming up in the fourth hour.
[02:55:21.874 --> 02:55:26.180]  I'm going to do five minutes to the next hour to take your calls with investigative journalist Wayne Madsen.
[02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:33.190]  Of course, I'm Alex Jones and I'll be part of the live coverage tonight with the crew that'll be here, I'll be at home, covering.
[02:55:33.490 --> 02:55:39.912]  The 2016 election, the final Republican debate of 2015 tonight from 7 and beyond.
[02:55:40.232 --> 02:55:42.692]  Central at InfoWarsNews.com.
[02:55:42.752 --> 02:55:45.373]  Free video feeds at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:45.873 --> 02:55:48.954]  Right now let's go to... Who is up first?
[02:55:48.974 --> 02:55:50.934]  Let's talk to Steve in Canada.
[02:55:51.215 --> 02:55:52.495]  You're on the air with Wayne Madsen.
[02:55:52.515 --> 02:55:52.855]  Go ahead.
[02:55:52.875 --> 02:55:55.916]  Hello Alex.
[02:55:56.156 --> 02:55:56.856]  Hello my friend.
[02:55:58.055 --> 02:55:59.516]  Yeah, thank you very much for taking my call.
[02:55:59.576 --> 02:56:02.078]  I just want to say congratulations on everything you're doing.
[02:56:02.138 --> 02:56:02.719]  It's very good.
[02:56:03.179 --> 02:56:14.027]  But my question to you, you kind of touched on it a little bit there, is I'm just curious why our military just, or not, sorry, your military, our military, everything, but why they don't, why they go along with everything?
[02:56:14.347 --> 02:56:20.652]  Well, I mean, because you get court-martialed or murdered if you, a bunch of generals under Clinton got shot in the head or shot in the chest in their offices.
[02:56:21.033 --> 02:56:22.474]  So they've been firing them, removing them.
[02:56:22.514 --> 02:56:26.577]  It's a big deal to have them retire and then come out and say the government ordered us to run Al Qaeda.
[02:56:26.997 --> 02:56:29.040]  Then it's up to us to get the system in trouble.
[02:56:29.080 --> 02:56:35.348]  But I agree, we need more military, as Steve Pucinich said last week, you know, to do the right thing and say no.
[02:56:36.069 --> 02:56:38.452]  Following orders is not a suicide pact for the country.
[02:56:38.772 --> 02:56:39.613]  Great point, Steve.
[02:56:40.094 --> 02:56:41.216]  Comment on that, Wayne Madsen.
[02:56:42.253 --> 02:56:47.399]  Well, you know, leadership is in short supply in many cases in the military.
[02:56:48.079 --> 02:56:53.385]  Some of our greatest military leaders were those who actually did not follow orders.
[02:56:53.785 --> 02:56:55.587]  And some of them were court-martials.
[02:56:55.627 --> 02:56:57.690]  Some of them got in trouble for their actions.
[02:56:57.790 --> 02:56:59.972]  But yeah, you see a lot of
[02:57:00.993 --> 02:57:06.477]  Brown nosers today, especially in the senior positions in the military.
[02:57:07.278 --> 02:57:15.144]  But it's nice to see when a General Flynn does come out and say, look, you know, this policy is crazy.
[02:57:15.784 --> 02:57:17.906]  We're supporting the enemy here.
[02:57:18.346 --> 02:57:25.691]  And the generals also need to be scaring all these slimy Harvard lawyers and hedge fund people that are complete gamblers, degenerate crazy gamblers.
[02:57:25.932 --> 02:57:28.634]  Hey, you're not going to gamble a nuclear war with the Chinese and the Russians.
[02:57:28.954 --> 02:57:30.175]  No, you're not going to do it, scum.
[02:57:30.595 --> 02:57:31.035]  Stop it!
[02:57:31.315 --> 02:57:31.755]  Stop it!
[02:57:32.575 --> 02:57:32.795]  Right.
[02:57:32.855 --> 02:57:48.438]  Not all these generals are put through like General Petraeus Ivy League schools where they become basically, you know, the same thing as what you find in the neocon think tanks, only they're wearing uniforms with a bunch of stars on their shoulders or collars.
[02:57:48.539 --> 02:57:54.480]  So there are some flag rank officers that came up the normal way and they don't put up with this.
[02:57:54.560 --> 02:57:55.740]  I wish there were more of them.
[02:57:56.300 --> 02:57:59.582]  But unfortunately, it's the military, like everything, is political.
[02:57:59.602 --> 02:58:01.944]  That's right, because we're not Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia.
[02:58:02.124 --> 02:58:03.885]  We don't run around starting giant wars.
[02:58:05.046 --> 02:58:05.366]  Right.
[02:58:05.766 --> 02:58:09.388]  I mean, it needs to... and America's not perfect, folks, but it's really crazy right now.
[02:58:09.809 --> 02:58:10.749]  Thank you for those points.
[02:58:10.809 --> 02:58:11.390]  Excellent points.
[02:58:11.670 --> 02:58:12.470]  Matt in Colorado.
[02:58:12.490 --> 02:58:13.111]  Got about a minute.
[02:58:13.131 --> 02:58:14.312]  We'll answer your question after the break.
[02:58:14.352 --> 02:58:14.672]  Go ahead.
[02:58:15.753 --> 02:58:16.313]  Hello, Alex.
[02:58:16.373 --> 02:58:17.594]  Thank you for all you do.
[02:58:17.614 --> 02:58:18.094]  Thank you.
[02:58:18.274 --> 02:58:20.676]  Just a quick question for you and Wade Madsen.
[02:58:21.316 --> 02:58:25.639]  If Donald Trump does not get in to be the president,
[02:58:25.990 --> 02:58:27.132]  We're going to break in 20 seconds.
[02:58:27.152 --> 02:58:27.893]  That's a great question.
[02:58:28.053 --> 02:58:30.276]  I'll have you come back to that.
[02:58:30.336 --> 02:58:32.259]  Wayne, what do you think?
[02:58:41.829 --> 02:58:43.912]  You know, I did not hear the question.
[02:58:43.932 --> 02:58:46.476]  For some reason, the audio didn't get sent over to you on that call.
[02:58:46.516 --> 02:58:47.077]  We'll come back.
[02:58:47.377 --> 02:58:48.419]  I'll ask you the question.
[02:58:48.659 --> 02:58:50.321]  Are we screwed if Hillary and Bernie get in?
[02:58:50.381 --> 02:58:51.082]  Are they the worst?
[02:58:51.423 --> 02:58:52.364]  Where do you see that going?
[02:58:52.404 --> 02:58:52.805]  We'll be back.
[02:58:59.693 --> 02:59:02.915]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:59:03.196 --> 02:59:11.222]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:11.442 --> 02:59:16.485]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:59:16.866 --> 02:59:19.147]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:59:19.408 --> 02:59:21.209]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[02:59:21.509 --> 02:59:25.692]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:59:29.577 --> 02:59:30.517]  BrainForce is here.
[02:59:30.697 --> 02:59:32.798]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:59:32.918 --> 02:59:37.639]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:59:37.900 --> 02:59:41.040]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:59:41.181 --> 02:59:44.402]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:59:44.682 --> 02:59:46.482]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:59:46.662 --> 02:59:48.523]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:59:48.743 --> 02:59:50.643]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:59:50.763 --> 02:59:56.365]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:00:02.242 --> 03:00:04.867]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:16.750 --> 03:00:19.392]  Arizona Sheriff tells citizens, step up and defend yourself.
[03:00:19.832 --> 03:00:21.313]  InfoWars.com, right now.
[03:00:22.214 --> 03:00:24.375]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[03:00:24.896 --> 03:00:27.357]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:00:27.878 --> 03:00:30.199]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:30.900 --> 03:00:32.221]  About five minutes, I'm getting up.
[03:00:32.241 --> 03:00:33.782]  Jakari's coming in here in the War Room.
[03:00:33.802 --> 03:00:35.203]  He won't be in the Situation Room today.
[03:00:36.593 --> 03:00:37.994]  We're gearing up for tonight's coverage.
[03:00:38.034 --> 03:00:39.115]  Wayne Madsen's our guest.
[03:00:39.916 --> 03:00:42.638]  Who is worse, a Jeb Bush or a Hillary candidacy?
[03:00:43.038 --> 03:00:44.299]  What happens if Hillary gets in?
[03:00:44.439 --> 03:00:46.881]  I'm telling you, Wayne, I'm not supporting Bush or Hillary.
[03:00:47.361 --> 03:00:51.464]  I think Hillary would be better, though, because she's already got so much, even more corruption than Jeb.
[03:00:51.484 --> 03:00:53.186]  I think we could take her down quicker.
[03:00:53.206 --> 03:00:58.249]  In my gut, I think Hillary would be better than Jeb because she's more defeatable.
[03:00:58.289 --> 03:00:58.730]  What do you think?
[03:00:59.639 --> 03:01:01.200]  Well, they're both bad news.
[03:01:01.780 --> 03:01:05.002]  You know, I remember Hillary, of course, about Gaddafi.
[03:01:05.063 --> 03:01:10.386]  We came, we saw he died, and then we got that cackling hen thing.
[03:01:10.726 --> 03:01:14.689]  I don't know if the country can put up with four to eight years of her cackling.
[03:01:14.889 --> 03:01:17.791]  Actually electing the Wicked Witch of the East?
[03:01:18.431 --> 03:01:19.312]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:01:19.332 --> 03:01:22.374]  I mean, maybe somebody should throw some water on her and see if she melts.
[03:01:22.975 --> 03:01:28.279]  But anyway, no, I mean, yeah, it's bad on both sides.
[03:01:28.359 --> 03:01:35.085]  I mean, you know, everybody's talking about Hillary, but can you imagine Bill Clinton's going to be back in the White House with nothing to do?
[03:01:35.105 --> 03:01:42.791]  You know, I fear for every intern in the White House because he'll just be running around as the first spouse.
[03:01:43.352 --> 03:01:45.894]  God only knows what could happen in the White House then.
[03:01:47.935 --> 03:01:51.478]  By the way, I have one more piece here that I wanted to mention to you, and it's silly.
[03:01:53.079 --> 03:02:02.967]  China is now buying Canadian air bottles with pressurized mountain air from Canada and actually breathing it because the smog is so bad in China.
[03:02:03.227 --> 03:02:06.190]  But under global warming, they want us to cut our carbon even though we're clean.
[03:02:06.610 --> 03:02:08.472]  This is literally out of Spaceballs.
[03:02:08.492 --> 03:02:10.153]  Can we queue up the Spaceballs clip?
[03:02:10.573 --> 03:02:14.857]  Bottles of Canadian fresh air, a hot sales item in China.
[03:02:14.877 --> 03:02:17.119]  I mean, China has gotten so incredibly
[03:02:19.011 --> 03:02:21.553]  So incredibly polluted that their rivers are catching on fire.
[03:02:21.913 --> 03:02:24.154]  Show, you talk about fiction becoming reality.
[03:02:24.194 --> 03:02:25.415]  Here's the clip from Spaceballs.
[03:02:37.222 --> 03:02:38.082]  It's Perry Air.
[03:02:39.743 --> 03:02:42.945]  Not Perry A. President Screw!
[03:02:44.566 --> 03:02:44.746]  Yes!
[03:02:46.360 --> 03:02:48.781]  And then he goes on to deny that there's any problem with the air.
[03:02:49.762 --> 03:02:52.824]  But that is actually a classic clip.
[03:02:52.924 --> 03:02:54.645]  What do you make of that, Wayne Madsen?
[03:02:55.385 --> 03:03:00.408]  I remember it was people say that it was ludicrous the thought of buying water, bottled water.
[03:03:00.508 --> 03:03:02.389]  They say, well, you know, I drink out of the tap.
[03:03:02.469 --> 03:03:02.609]  Yeah, I
[03:03:19.722 --> 03:03:25.585]  Fortunately, when they did not have this smog problem, but when they have it, it's pretty awful.
[03:03:26.766 --> 03:03:41.653]  And China and Saudi Arabia, of course, were really reluctant to go along with this agreement in Paris because they were fearful of their own sovereign ability to make decisions.
[03:03:41.753 --> 03:03:43.394]  Absolutely, but you talk about ludicrous.
[03:03:43.494 --> 03:03:48.697]  In space balls, they have ludicrous speed and then plaid speed, which is faster than warp speed.
[03:03:49.537 --> 03:03:50.258]  Right, right.
[03:03:50.318 --> 03:03:54.160]  I mean, I think a lot of this is incredible.
[03:03:54.220 --> 03:03:57.942]  I mean, who would have ever predicted somebody selling air?
[03:03:59.463 --> 03:04:03.105]  But then again, I remember when people said it was ludicrous to sell bottled water.
[03:04:04.206 --> 03:04:05.807]  Well, I don't have time to get to other callers.
[03:04:05.867 --> 03:04:07.268]  Marcus, Harvey, others.
[03:04:07.588 --> 03:04:09.389]  I guarantee you, Jakari wants to talk to you.
[03:04:09.870 --> 03:04:12.851]  Try to get to everybody, but the fourth hour is now basically here.
[03:04:12.871 --> 03:04:15.993]  And so I'm going to punch out Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com.
[03:04:18.005 --> 03:04:19.966]  Give us your next pitch, where you want to go, what you want to cover.
[03:04:19.986 --> 03:04:23.527]  I want to kind of put you out there on the campaign trail some, RNC, DNC.
[03:04:23.827 --> 03:04:26.568]  We can start getting you credentialed, or you can do that through your own system if you'd like.
[03:04:26.928 --> 03:04:30.649]  But we have a meeting soon about what you're going to be doing here for the election.
[03:04:30.709 --> 03:04:36.711]  And thank you so much for the great articles that appear basically four or five times a week at InfoWars.com that you write for us, Wayne.
[03:04:37.551 --> 03:04:38.912]  Yes, Rubio's next.
[03:04:39.949 --> 03:04:41.690]  All right, my friend, thank you so much.
[03:04:42.111 --> 03:04:45.213]  All right, Jakari Jackson is going to be coming in here into the hot seat.
[03:04:45.253 --> 03:04:47.695]  It is hot, as the polar bear has been sitting here.
[03:04:48.335 --> 03:05:02.906]  And then we are going to continue on until tonight, 7 o'clock central, with InfoWars Nightly News and the live coverage of the final debate of the Republicans in 2015 from beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada.
[03:05:02.927 --> 03:05:08.451]  Oh, let's get ready to rumble!
[03:05:10.146 --> 03:05:12.348]  Another GOP debate is upon us.
[03:05:12.828 --> 03:05:18.472]  A time to see how much attention will be allotted to establishment candidates who are dragging in the polls.
[03:05:18.892 --> 03:05:20.173]  These are Republican governors.
[03:05:20.553 --> 03:05:22.935]  They don't give any credit to the free market.
[03:05:23.095 --> 03:05:25.336]  They don't give any credit to the entrepreneur.
[03:05:25.616 --> 03:05:26.997]  All is not lost though.
[03:05:27.398 --> 03:05:29.179]  Some are speaking on real issues.
[03:05:29.539 --> 03:05:34.462]  But if you're not going to respond to the no-fly zone strategy, what would yours be?
[03:05:35.083 --> 03:05:37.845]  The first thing I would do is I wouldn't arm our enemies.
[03:05:38.465 --> 03:05:39.466]  I wouldn't arm ISIS.
[03:05:40.206 --> 03:05:40.486]  Yes.
[03:05:41.227 --> 03:05:44.228]  Will controversial statements impact some of the candidates?
[03:05:44.528 --> 03:05:58.235]  Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
[03:05:59.056 --> 03:06:03.539]  Join InfoWars this Tuesday, December 15th, starting at 7 p.m.
[03:06:03.599 --> 03:06:07.801]  Central for another episode of Political Science Theater 3K.
[03:06:08.701 --> 03:06:09.502]  Alex Jones here.
[03:06:09.642 --> 03:06:26.171]  InfoWarsStore.com is now partnering with the top-of-the-line storable food company, My Patriot Supply, to bring you the highest quality, freshest, longest-lasting, most affordable storable foods, private-labeled, from InfoWarsSelect.com at the lowest price you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:06:26.311 --> 03:06:27.872]  The globalists want us dependent.
[03:06:28.032 --> 03:06:29.512]  We need to be self-sufficient.
[03:06:29.632 --> 03:06:34.854]  And if you don't have high-quality, long-lasting, storable foods, I believe you're making a huge mistake.

[03:08:19.098 --> 03:08:22.160]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[03:08:22.700 --> 03:08:24.361]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[03:08:24.741 --> 03:08:25.801]  The real owners.
[03:08:25.881 --> 03:08:30.404]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[03:08:30.784 --> 03:08:32.004]  Forget the politicians.
[03:08:32.244 --> 03:08:35.506]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[03:08:37.087 --> 03:08:37.527]  You don't.
[03:08:38.307 --> 03:08:39.288]  You have no choice.
[03:08:39.668 --> 03:08:40.588]  You have owners.
[03:08:40.908 --> 03:08:41.829]  They own you.
[03:08:43.155 --> 03:08:44.456]  They own everything.
[03:08:44.696 --> 03:08:46.397]  They own all the important land.
[03:08:46.698 --> 03:08:48.439]  They own and control the corporations.
[03:08:48.479 --> 03:08:51.942]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[03:08:51.962 --> 03:08:53.543]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[03:08:53.883 --> 03:08:58.686]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[03:08:58.867 --> 03:09:00.488]  They got you by the balls!
[03:09:01.989 --> 03:09:04.090]  They want obedient workers.
[03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:06.031]  Obedient workers.
[03:09:06.351 --> 03:09:19.058]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[03:09:19.138 --> 03:09:22.380]  And now, they're coming for your social security money.
[03:09:22.840 --> 03:09:25.482]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[03:09:26.922 --> 03:09:27.803]  It's a big club.
[03:09:28.812 --> 03:09:29.833]  And you ain't in it.
[03:09:29.853 --> 03:09:35.176]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[03:09:35.516 --> 03:09:36.397]  You better believe it.
[03:09:36.497 --> 03:09:38.358]  So what specifically did they do?
[03:09:38.819 --> 03:09:43.962]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand.
[03:09:43.982 --> 03:09:44.822]  A lot of money.
[03:09:45.443 --> 03:09:48.165]  You and I are not in the big club.
[03:09:48.505 --> 03:09:50.446]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[03:09:51.066 --> 03:09:54.789]  It's called the American dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[03:09:56.212 --> 03:09:57.693]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[03:09:58.053 --> 03:10:01.535]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[03:10:01.575 --> 03:10:05.517]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[03:10:05.537 --> 03:10:06.478]  They're not interested in that.
[03:10:06.758 --> 03:10:07.658]  That doesn't help them.
[03:10:08.079 --> 03:10:09.439]  That's against their interest.
[03:10:09.940 --> 03:10:10.360]  That's right.
[03:10:10.620 --> 03:10:15.663]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:10:22.048 --> 03:10:24.710]  All right, and welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:10:24.730 --> 03:10:27.352]  Ja'Kari Jackson, Joe Biggs here in studio.
[03:10:27.372 --> 03:10:30.354]  And we're going to talk about many things on our hour here.
[03:10:30.374 --> 03:10:31.915]  We're going to take calls a little bit later.
[03:10:31.935 --> 03:10:36.898]  We're going to talk about gun grabbers, you know, pushing the no fly, no buy list, many other things.
[03:10:36.938 --> 03:10:42.482]  But first, as I have Joe Biggs here in studio, we're going to talk about some things that are going on in our nation's schools.
[03:10:43.303 --> 03:10:50.668]  And one of them is a new article from David Knight, Turkish Imams, USA network of schools to be investigated as part of a lawsuit.
[03:10:51.448 --> 03:10:57.650]  The Turkish government has filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania against the powerful Turkish Islamic clerk, I believe the name is Gulen.
[03:10:58.511 --> 03:11:16.658]  The lawsuit alleges that Gulen issued orders from within the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania directing his well-placed religious followers residing in Turkey to launch a targeted campaign of persecution using a network of loyal state officials, police, prosecutors, judges and so forth in Turkey willing to do his bidding.
[03:11:17.578 --> 03:11:28.350]  But the kicker about this is, while Gulen's network of influence in Turkey is allegedly based on infiltration of police and the judiciary, the rest of the world is influenced by his schools.
[03:11:28.410 --> 03:11:32.855]  And the estimates are that they have about 300 schools in Turkey, 1,000 worldwide.
[03:11:33.195 --> 03:11:38.401]  In the United States, they have about 146 taxpayer-funded charter schools as of September 2014.
[03:11:39.682 --> 03:11:51.071]  They just opened up one here in Austin as well, so if you go to the actual article and watch the video that's linked in there, David Knight actually talks about that school that they just opened here.
[03:11:51.091 --> 03:11:53.432]  I mean, there's a lot of these places that are popping up.
[03:11:53.612 --> 03:12:06.082]  You know, when we were doing this investigation of the American Caliphate, you know, the Islamberg is not just a commune where they house Muslims, it's also a Quranic institute where they teach this kind of stuff.
[03:12:06.522 --> 03:12:15.365]  You know, from the outside looking in, it might look like a peaceful thing that's going on where everyone's just kind of happy and they're learning, but that's all you can say is from the outside looking in.
[03:12:15.885 --> 03:12:21.387]  You know, not many people can go into these places and actually go in and investigate and find out what's really going on.
[03:12:21.427 --> 03:12:22.067]  So it's interesting.
[03:12:22.087 --> 03:12:32.931]  It's something that we'll add to our list when we are continuing this investigation of the American caliphate and actually dig into this deeper and see if we can find out what's going on with this school.
[03:12:33.531 --> 03:12:38.612]  And as Joe alluded to, David did do a report about this, a video report, so you can find that linked in the article.
[03:12:39.173 --> 03:12:43.174]  Now, Biggs, I saw this article the other day, and I really wanted to get your opinion on it.
[03:12:43.834 --> 03:12:47.915]  And the headline is, Parents School at Odds Over Teens Flag Photo.
[03:12:48.535 --> 03:12:50.576]  And we can pull it up here so we can show all of our viewers.
[03:12:50.636 --> 03:12:53.636]  I'll describe it to our listeners who are listening on the radio.
[03:12:53.676 --> 03:12:54.557]  Basically, this is a
[03:12:56.557 --> 03:13:02.201]  A high school student, you know, a lot of times for your senior pictures, they allow you to get a professional photographer to take your own pictures and all that.
[03:13:03.002 --> 03:13:05.884]  And the young lady, she's having controversy.
[03:13:05.904 --> 03:13:11.748]  It's not because of what she's wearing, because a lot of times we see, like, the kids, they wear something that's, you know, provocative or whatever.
[03:13:12.028 --> 03:13:16.791]  You know, she's very nicely dressed, nothing sticking out, nothing sensational about it.
[03:13:17.251 --> 03:13:24.816]  But as you can see, she's standing in front of a very large American flag that is so large it actually hits the floor, and she is standing on the flag.
[03:13:25.356 --> 03:13:30.880]  And the school's reason for banning this photo is because she's actually standing on the American flag.
[03:13:31.180 --> 03:13:37.324]  So Joe Biggs, as a military man, a combat veteran, what say you about this yearbook photo?
[03:13:38.004 --> 03:13:42.765]  I mean, is it actually a large American flag, or is this just some kind of backdrop?
[03:13:43.105 --> 03:13:48.767]  You know, if it's an actual American flag, then yeah, you know, that's, that kind of goes against, that's disrespectful in a sense, yeah.
[03:13:48.787 --> 03:13:55.009]  But I mean, if it's like a wallpaper or something, and you're using that to have a patriotic background, I can understand that.
[03:13:55.149 --> 03:14:04.111]  But at the same time, it's just like, I can't get mad about the Black Lives Matter movement going out and burning flags and standing on them, and then not get mad at her if that's an actual flag.
[03:14:04.131 --> 03:14:06.492]  So if that's an actual flag, then yeah, I think I have a problem with it.
[03:14:06.932 --> 03:14:09.294]  But if it's just used as a backdrop, I think that's a little different.
[03:14:09.334 --> 03:14:13.958]  If it's just some paper, like some random cloth, it's actually not a flag.
[03:14:14.218 --> 03:14:16.000]  I think it was a flag, you know.
[03:14:16.080 --> 03:14:18.822]  It's just a short article, but I think it was an actual flag.
[03:14:18.862 --> 03:14:21.985]  But okay, so basically, if it's just some type of paper, it's a backdrop.
[03:14:22.025 --> 03:14:28.090]  Yeah, I mean, if it's something you printed out and made something and it's not an actual flag that you buy, it's got the little, the hooks that go up and all that.
[03:14:28.150 --> 03:14:31.152]  If it's not an actual flag, then whatever, who cares?
[03:14:31.212 --> 03:14:34.455]  I mean, but if it was an actual flag, I would not like that.
[03:14:34.495 --> 03:14:35.176]  I mean, I'm not gonna...
[03:14:35.856 --> 03:14:37.898]  Call into the school and ban the photo.
[03:14:38.338 --> 03:14:45.265]  But I mean, as someone who fought for this country and someone who really cares deeply about the country and what it means and what I want it to be.
[03:14:45.285 --> 03:14:47.607]  Yeah, I mean, I think that's kind of disrespectful.
[03:14:48.067 --> 03:14:48.448]  All right.
[03:14:48.828 --> 03:14:49.809]  And the hits keep on coming.
[03:14:49.849 --> 03:14:51.030]  That was in Massachusetts.
[03:14:51.050 --> 03:14:53.012]  Now we have a story from New York.
[03:14:53.412 --> 03:14:57.156]  And a principal is banning Christmas, as we've seen many, many times before.
[03:14:57.196 --> 03:14:59.278]  But now they're even banning the Pledge of Allegiance.
[03:14:59.718 --> 03:15:00.158]  Joe Bix.
[03:15:00.839 --> 03:15:02.500]  They're banning the Pledge of Allegiance.
[03:15:02.580 --> 03:15:04.361]  Yeah, I read when that happened.
[03:15:04.381 --> 03:15:06.083]  That was extremely ridiculous.
[03:15:06.143 --> 03:15:12.387]  I mean, that's the country we're living in nowadays where we can't even have pride in our own nation.
[03:15:13.410 --> 03:15:21.477]  We can't, we're a Christian country, we're a country founded on Christianity, you know, and then we can't even say the Pledge of Allegiance in our country?
[03:15:22.338 --> 03:15:26.681]  That'd be like me going to Mexico and telling them they can't say their thing, or into Canada or something like that.
[03:15:26.701 --> 03:15:31.626]  They're gonna slap me upside the face and tell me to get the hell out of here and go back to America.
[03:15:31.686 --> 03:15:32.927]  So, you know, how dare them?
[03:15:33.267 --> 03:15:41.094]  But I just read the update, they actually, it just popped up on Twitter a minute ago before we came in here, they're actually allowing Christmas trees to come back
[03:15:41.614 --> 03:15:45.935]  And the celebration of Christmas along with the Pledge of Allegiance, they didn't say anything about Thanksgiving though.
[03:15:47.356 --> 03:15:54.558]  It's so funny to me because we've seen all these stories Biggs, I believe it was in California, they were telling the kids they couldn't wear American flag to Easter.
[03:15:54.618 --> 03:16:00.940]  All this type of stuff and just like you said, if you go to some foreign country and tell them not to wave their flag, I think they'd have a pretty big issue with it.
[03:16:00.960 --> 03:16:04.441]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure if I went to Belgium and I said, hey man, your flag offends me.
[03:16:04.941 --> 03:16:06.042]  You need to take that down.
[03:16:06.062 --> 03:16:07.923]  Instead, I need you to raise my flag.
[03:16:08.324 --> 03:16:11.726]  I need you guys to be more tolerant of me and stop speaking your gibberish.
[03:16:11.766 --> 03:16:13.868]  Start speaking English because I don't understand you.
[03:16:14.288 --> 03:16:16.910]  They're going to backhand me and tell me to get the hell out of there and go back to America.
[03:16:17.391 --> 03:16:23.095]  Which is why I don't understand why people understand that here in our country, we're a country founded on Christianity.
[03:16:24.176 --> 03:16:26.838]  You either need to assimilate, you need to be an American.
[03:16:27.579 --> 03:16:29.280]  Anybody could just move somewhere and say they're something.
[03:16:29.320 --> 03:16:30.321]  No, it takes more than that.
[03:16:30.641 --> 03:16:31.842]  You've got to conform to our ways.
[03:16:31.862 --> 03:16:33.343]  You have to work at being American.
[03:16:33.363 --> 03:16:34.203]  I want to see you get a job.
[03:16:34.223 --> 03:16:35.284]  I want to see you do something.
[03:16:35.324 --> 03:16:35.945]  That's what it means.
[03:16:36.605 --> 03:16:41.509]  And I was thinking about this, because just like we're talking about the flags and the Pledge of Allegiance and all this.
[03:16:42.209 --> 03:16:43.050]  I was watching some fights.
[03:16:43.110 --> 03:16:47.192]  I'm not a big UFC guy, but I was watching some fights on this past Saturday.
[03:16:47.672 --> 03:16:52.115]  And you know, the thing that everybody does, or a lot of the fighters do, once they win the fight, they'll come out with their flag.
[03:16:52.135 --> 03:16:54.657]  You know, they come from Brazil, they come from Mexico, or wherever.
[03:16:54.997 --> 03:16:56.978]  And they jump up there with their flag and they celebrate.
[03:16:57.258 --> 03:17:00.440]  All these people who are offended by flags, I have this idea.
[03:17:00.680 --> 03:17:01.821]  Go to a UFC fight.
[03:17:02.361 --> 03:17:08.207]  And if you're that offended by somebody's flag, hop the guardrail, jump into the ring and tell that guy to drop his flag.
[03:17:08.507 --> 03:17:11.930]  And then when you regain consciousness, you tell me if that was worth your time.
[03:17:11.990 --> 03:17:14.793]  That's what I think people need to do if they're really offended.
[03:17:14.833 --> 03:17:18.176]  Because it's a thing of pride though, that's the whole thing about the flag.
[03:17:18.576 --> 03:17:20.979]  It represents more than, it's not just a piece of cloth.
[03:17:21.638 --> 03:17:27.263]  It represents the people who died for the values, to die for what that country represents.
[03:17:27.923 --> 03:17:33.468]  That flag is a representation of what we as Americans want to portray out and what we believe in.
[03:17:33.488 --> 03:17:34.889]  That's right.
[03:17:35.270 --> 03:17:37.472]  Even though the country has gone to complete and total...
[03:17:38.962 --> 03:17:41.344]  You know?
[03:17:41.524 --> 03:17:45.087]  I still want it to represent more than what it looks like now to the outside looking in.
[03:17:45.367 --> 03:17:50.351]  That's why I see a lot of patriots that are fighting for this country and standing up and saying, you know what, enough is enough.
[03:17:50.411 --> 03:17:51.492]  Fly the American flag.
[03:17:53.015 --> 03:17:54.537]  Play Christmas music, who cares?
[03:17:54.777 --> 03:17:54.958]  Yeah.
[03:17:55.498 --> 03:18:00.705]  Now, something that I think is very un-American, we have many people pushing for this no-fly, no-gun-by list.
[03:18:00.745 --> 03:18:01.867]  I'm sure you've heard about this.
[03:18:01.947 --> 03:18:08.355]  And jumping on this, not surprising, are Chuckie Schumer and Governor Cuomo.
[03:18:09.184 --> 03:18:09.705]  I don't know.
[03:18:29.423 --> 03:18:38.306]  For example, I was just at GT Distributors, this little store up the place where I usually go and look at guns that you showed me to where I can get all my cool tactical gear, and there was a police officer in uniform trying to buy a gun.
[03:18:38.686 --> 03:18:43.387]  He was told no because his name, when they came back, is similar to another guy with warrants in California.
[03:18:43.407 --> 03:18:44.447]  He has the exact same name.
[03:18:44.868 --> 03:18:49.809]  So they declined it and blocked it and said no, and he had to wait and then file something to get that.
[03:18:50.109 --> 03:18:50.289]  Yes.
[03:19:06.471 --> 03:19:10.013]  A horrible situation, and he used it to exploit his own agenda.
[03:19:10.413 --> 03:19:14.655]  That's something he's been looking for to happen, so he can go, okay, now let's go ahead and push this.
[03:19:14.955 --> 03:19:17.536]  Just like with the Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon.
[03:19:17.917 --> 03:19:20.218]  He took that and used that to push for gun control.
[03:19:20.518 --> 03:19:22.759]  Now he's using this to push for this no-fly thing.
[03:19:23.059 --> 03:19:24.920]  And like you said, anybody can get put on it.
[03:19:25.200 --> 03:19:26.581]  Because of the similarity of a name?
[03:19:27.142 --> 03:19:29.323]  Or the fact that they just get thrown on by accident?
[03:19:29.444 --> 03:19:34.808]  Or maybe it's not an accident, maybe there's this whole secret list and they just don't like certain people based off your Facebook posts.
[03:19:35.288 --> 03:19:39.411]  And the thing about it is, they've recently changed it to where now you can fight it.
[03:19:39.552 --> 03:19:42.174]  I'm not sure how successful those fights have been.
[03:19:42.194 --> 03:19:42.654]  Probably not.
[03:19:42.894 --> 03:19:47.398]  But, you know, it used to be like you got put on it and you had no idea how you got on it, what was going to happen next.
[03:19:47.818 --> 03:19:49.560]  So we'll have more on this.
[03:19:49.620 --> 03:19:52.122]  Is that Alex Jones sneaking into the studio?

[03:25:02.336 --> 03:25:02.736]  We're good to go.
[03:25:02.816 --> 03:25:03.196]  We're good to go.
[03:25:03.216 --> 03:25:03.657]  We're good to go.
[03:25:03.677 --> 03:25:03.777]  We're
[03:25:05.543 --> 03:25:12.048]  Yeah, my question is concerning basically the election tonight, or the GOP election tonight.
[03:25:12.068 --> 03:25:23.516]  And from what I've seen on TV, they're basically ridiculing Cruz about him and his cockpit bombing statement about destroying ISIS.
[03:25:23.616 --> 03:25:29.481]  And my question to you guys is, what do you think or what do you believe has the best plan
[03:25:30.040 --> 03:25:34.343]  In defeating ISIS with, as far as the whole GOP candidacy go.
[03:25:34.683 --> 03:25:39.627]  I'm going to say Lindsey Graham because he just wants to blow up the whole universe to get rid of ISIS.
[03:25:39.807 --> 03:25:41.568]  I mean, that's someone who wants to just bomb everything.
[03:25:41.608 --> 03:25:45.231]  But I mean, militarily speaking, I mean, he could carpet bomb stuff.
[03:25:45.251 --> 03:25:49.354]  And I mean, I was reading some articles my special operations buddies put out.
[03:25:49.794 --> 03:25:52.056]  It takes more than just bombing a whole bunch of buildings.
[03:25:52.076 --> 03:25:52.296]  Yes.
[03:25:52.817 --> 03:25:54.198]  Especially when our government
[03:25:54.858 --> 03:26:00.883]  I was reading articles earlier today, they know where these propaganda sites are, where these guys are running social media over there, they won't bomb them.
[03:26:01.683 --> 03:26:04.566]  You know, so if they bomb something, what are they going to be bombing?
[03:26:05.390 --> 03:26:13.673]  And on top of that, when you bomb, say if they went in there and just bombed the entire area, all the people who survived, you've created a whole other generation of people.
[03:26:13.693 --> 03:26:14.254]  Of enemies, yeah.
[03:26:14.374 --> 03:26:15.774]  Of enemies who are going to want to go in.
[03:26:15.794 --> 03:26:17.515]  You've got to go in there and you've got to attack the money.
[03:26:17.755 --> 03:26:18.876]  You've got to take that money away.
[03:26:18.896 --> 03:26:21.737]  You've got to stop that from happening so they can't grow any further.
[03:26:22.057 --> 03:26:22.877]  Then you've got to go in.
[03:26:22.897 --> 03:26:24.458]  This all has to be done strategically.
[03:26:24.478 --> 03:26:26.799]  You can't just do it with bombs and bullets.
[03:26:26.999 --> 03:26:29.140]  I mean, that works, you know, essentially in some ways.
[03:26:29.640 --> 03:26:30.761]  But this is an idea.
[03:26:30.841 --> 03:26:33.142]  It's just like they could come in and bomb America.
[03:26:33.182 --> 03:26:33.682]  But guess what?
[03:26:33.722 --> 03:26:36.144]  America will prevail because America is an idea.
[03:26:36.164 --> 03:26:38.024]  A way that we believe and we're going to go.
[03:26:38.065 --> 03:26:39.445]  And it's the same thing with these guys.
[03:26:39.665 --> 03:26:41.726]  They're willing to die and fight for this idea.
[03:26:41.766 --> 03:26:43.047]  So you can bomb them to hell and back.
[03:26:43.347 --> 03:26:49.531]  But at the end of the day, you're just going to create more people who want to stand up and they're going to be angrier and they're going to hate us for the rest of their lives.
[03:26:50.271 --> 03:26:51.392]  Well, thank you so much, Marcus.
[03:26:51.412 --> 03:26:53.853]  Let's move on now to Mark in California.
[03:26:53.873 --> 03:26:57.675]  Now, Wayne Mattson has left us, but you're welcome to go ahead and make your statement, Mark.
[03:26:59.778 --> 03:27:06.739]  Yes sir, I would like to ask if Wayne Madsen knew Michael Aquino, because he was the former head of the NSA.
[03:27:07.819 --> 03:27:15.901]  And I was hoping maybe you could ask him and talk about this guy, because he's a devil worshipper there in San Francisco.
[03:27:16.381 --> 03:27:18.101]  Very, very despicable man.
[03:27:18.161 --> 03:27:25.582]  As a matter of fact, if I had to put my finger on the most wicked man that's living, it'd be either him or David Rockefeller.
[03:27:25.842 --> 03:27:28.883]  And so I was wondering if Wayne Madsen actually
[03:27:30.014 --> 03:27:57.822]  You know, I know he knows about him, because he was the top dog, you know, and if he knew anything about him, because he was friends with Anton LaVey, and Oprah, you know, Anton LaVey started the Church of Satan in San Francisco, and when Oprah interviewed Michael Aquino, the former head of the NSA, there were like 800 people that called the FBI and said that they had been masquerading as a child by Michael Aquino.
[03:27:58.462 --> 03:27:59.763]  Yes, this is Harvey in Florida.
[03:27:59.783 --> 03:28:00.663]  Hello, Jakari and Joe Biggs.
[03:28:00.783 --> 03:28:01.584]  How's it going?
[03:28:01.604 --> 03:28:03.345]  Yeah, I wanted to talk to Wayne Madsen, but
[03:28:28.726 --> 03:28:37.168]  They were talking, him and Alex were talking about how the military generals are like cowards and they don't get involved with saying anything or stopping anything.
[03:28:37.188 --> 03:28:52.231]  And I want to bring up Bradley Manning, who was like the bravest soldier in my memory for getting that classified information, the emails and the information on the State Department and passing it on to Julian Assange.
[03:28:52.871 --> 03:28:55.872]  Now what they did to that poor guy, they tortured him for two years.
[03:28:57.361 --> 03:29:01.744]  Then they tried him in a kangaroo court in Virginia.
[03:29:01.764 --> 03:29:09.309]  I think it was in Virginia there at Fort, or whatever that name is, but the NSA is located over there.
[03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:11.351]  Fort Lee, Fort Lee.
[03:29:12.271 --> 03:29:12.752]  And, um,
[03:29:13.502 --> 03:29:16.425]  This guy, like he went into the gulag, he disappeared.
[03:29:16.485 --> 03:29:21.991]  They said he was gay, and they gave him a girl's name, and all this crap.
[03:29:22.031 --> 03:29:24.053]  What do you two gentlemen think about that guy?
[03:29:24.073 --> 03:29:26.055]  Did you show you were in the military?
[03:29:26.596 --> 03:29:30.400]  I'd like to get your take on it, because to me, he's the bravest soldier we had.
[03:29:32.420 --> 03:29:34.482]  I don't share the same sentiments in a sense.
[03:29:34.562 --> 03:29:41.746]  I mean, you know, when you go about something like that, you can put people's lives at danger when you're releasing things like that.
[03:29:42.227 --> 03:29:43.728]  But that's just from a soldier's standpoint.
[03:29:43.748 --> 03:29:49.531]  I mean, not being in that situation and when someone leaks something, you not have to worry about dying.
[03:29:49.551 --> 03:29:51.753]  And then I do out there on the ground, it's a little different.
[03:29:52.253 --> 03:29:53.274]  All right, well, thank you so much.
[03:29:53.294 --> 03:29:56.236]  We'll come back right after this break with more calls on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:59.144 --> 03:30:02.154]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.077 --> 03:30:05.766]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.835 --> 03:30:15.137]  A New York City principal has banned Christmas and the Pledge of Allegiance, reports EAG News.
[03:30:15.537 --> 03:30:24.620]  The new principal has also eliminated Thanksgiving, despite clear notice from the city's Department of Education allowing for holiday themes and symbols, the New York Post writes.
[03:30:24.980 --> 03:30:26.981]  We definitely can't say Christmas.
[03:30:27.241 --> 03:30:32.243]  Nothing with Christmas on it, nothing with Santa, a local PTA president told the news site.
[03:30:32.603 --> 03:30:33.403]  No angels.
[03:30:33.743 --> 03:30:38.565]  We can't even have a star because it can represent a religious system, like the Star of David.
[03:30:39.205 --> 03:30:46.531]  The report states that about 95% of the students at Brooklyn's PS169 are either Hispanic or Asian.
[03:30:47.052 --> 03:30:54.678]  And the assistant principal announced last month that the school is changing its holiday traditions to be sensitive to the diversity of our families.
[03:30:55.398 --> 03:30:58.301]  Not all children celebrate the same holidays, he added.
[03:30:58.921 --> 03:31:02.604]  And the Pledge of Allegiance was also ditched when the principal took office.
[03:31:03.085 --> 03:31:06.788]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[03:31:09.662 --> 03:31:11.023]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:31:11.303 --> 03:31:12.603]  You can't survive without it.
[03:31:12.803 --> 03:31:13.704]  But where do you get it?
[03:31:14.004 --> 03:31:19.766]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:31:19.986 --> 03:31:25.708]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:31:25.908 --> 03:31:42.755]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:31:43.155 --> 03:31:45.276]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:31:45.637 --> 03:31:46.837]  Stainless steel construction.
[03:31:47.118 --> 03:31:47.818]  Easy assembly.
[03:31:48.138 --> 03:31:48.779]  Low maintenance.
[03:31:49.059 --> 03:31:50.900]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:32:03.989 --> 03:32:05.029]  I want more candy!
[03:32:05.169 --> 03:32:06.650]  I want more video games!
[03:32:06.670 --> 03:32:07.471]  Mine, mine, mine!
[03:32:12.654 --> 03:32:22.062]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[03:32:22.402 --> 03:32:24.964]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[03:32:25.105 --> 03:32:28.467]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[03:32:28.648 --> 03:32:34.673]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[03:32:34.993 --> 03:32:39.817]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[03:32:40.097 --> 03:32:46.279]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[03:32:46.479 --> 03:32:53.961]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[03:32:54.221 --> 03:33:01.504]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[03:33:21.530 --> 03:33:24.413]  President Obama's record-breaking national debt.
[03:33:24.974 --> 03:33:28.278]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not
[03:33:29.491 --> 03:33:30.291]  Increase our debt.
[03:33:30.612 --> 03:33:41.478]  Increasing Obamacare tax penalties and premiums, blue-collar depleting trade deals, and overall Salinski-esque tactics are demolishing the American middle class.
[03:33:41.798 --> 03:33:57.627]  As we near the finish line of Obama's two terms, the only change we've experienced is a totalitarian transformation of the presidential office begun by his criminal counterparts that have continuously seized the throne since JFK was gunned down in Dallas.
[03:34:01.092 --> 03:34:09.159]  Breitbart reports Pew Research found that the share of American adults living in middle income households has fallen from 61% in 1971 to 50% in 2015.
[03:34:09.199 --> 03:34:11.361]  The share living in the upper income tier rose from 14% to 21%.
[03:34:18.908 --> 03:34:20.069]  Over the same period.
[03:34:20.249 --> 03:34:23.492]  Meanwhile, the share in the lower income tier increased from 25% to 29%.
[03:34:23.572 --> 03:34:26.014]  Manufacturing accounted for 26% of employed adults in 1971, compared with 11% in 2014.
[03:34:26.094 --> 03:34:31.379]  A Gallup poll discovered that since the year 2000 through 2008, 10% of middle class to upper middle class of Americans transferred into the lower class.
[03:34:45.872 --> 03:34:50.636]  62% of Americans have under $1,000 in savings.
[03:34:50.957 --> 03:34:57.822]  Meanwhile, Obamacare will raise the penalty next year by 50% for not participating to $1,000.
[03:34:59.524 --> 03:35:03.007]  Just to make sure that anybody struggling can't get ahead.
[03:35:03.287 --> 03:35:12.015]  So their goal has always been to eliminate the middle class, raise taxes, give away their health care to poor and illegals, flood the country with immigrants.
[03:35:12.755 --> 03:35:25.147]  Degrade our position abroad, do everything they can to eliminate the foundation of what supports the free market system and that is the only threat to their having a permanent hold on power.
[03:35:25.468 --> 03:35:27.630]  The goal is to keep a permanent hold on power.
[03:35:28.419 --> 03:35:38.087]  When I grew up, I guess it was the years before you grew up, but we had a country of middle-class families who had intact nuclear families.
[03:35:38.127 --> 03:35:44.212]  That is, the mother and father were married to each other and raising their own children in one household.
[03:35:45.132 --> 03:35:49.456]  And now, that's just a minority of people in our country.
[03:35:50.294 --> 03:35:54.796]  But the nuclear family was a self-contained economic unit.
[03:35:54.916 --> 03:35:59.377]  They spent their own money, made their own decisions, decided how they were going to raise their children.
[03:36:00.017 --> 03:36:08.360]  The now pseudo-privileged, financially doomed millennial generation has proclaimed the death of the American dream, according to a Harvard poll.
[03:36:08.640 --> 03:36:17.783]  Blindly throwing their collective votes towards the socialist promises of Bernie Sanders out of total desperation, the millennial generation workforce
[03:36:18.223 --> 03:36:20.985]  Still makes up 40% of the unemployed.
[03:36:21.265 --> 03:36:30.551]  This generation will overtake the baby boomer generation as the nation's largest living population approaching 75 million strong.
[03:36:30.811 --> 03:36:41.018]  A generation that will inherit the mind-controlling PC culture, dwindling middle class numbers, Obamacare penalties and rate hikes, and crippling student debt.
[03:36:41.278 --> 03:36:45.521]  If you thought the middle class was in trouble now, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[03:36:45.801 --> 03:36:47.803]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[03:36:49.884 --> 03:36:52.266]  Another fantastic report there from John Bowne.
[03:36:52.506 --> 03:36:59.290]  And that's the thing as we're watching this video with all the college students, if you're listening on the radio, he had several college students featured in that video.
[03:37:00.663 --> 03:37:07.847]  You have all these people who are coming out of school with massive amounts of debt and not a whole lot of prospects for jobs in the future.
[03:37:07.867 --> 03:37:15.491]  You know, a lot of these guys, and including it happened to myself for an extended period of time, you know, you get out of school and then you just go work some job.
[03:37:15.531 --> 03:37:19.794]  You go work at IHOP, you go work at Denny's, you go work at Walmart or someplace like that.
[03:37:20.074 --> 03:37:23.156]  Just trying to make your ends meet and then eventually maybe there's some type of a
[03:37:23.576 --> 03:37:24.217]  We're good to go.
[03:37:24.257 --> 03:37:24.677]  We're good to go.
[03:37:24.697 --> 03:37:25.137]  We're good to go.
[03:37:25.197 --> 03:37:25.638]  We're good to go.
[03:37:25.658 --> 03:37:26.598]  We're good to go.
[03:37:26.618 --> 03:37:27.259]  We're good to go.
[03:37:27.279 --> 03:37:27.719]  We're good to go.
[03:37:27.759 --> 03:37:28.140]  We're good to go.
[03:37:28.160 --> 03:37:28.660]  We're good to go.
[03:37:28.720 --> 03:37:29.681]  We're good to go.
[03:37:29.721 --> 03:37:30.301]  We're good to go.
[03:37:30.341 --> 03:37:31.382]  We're good to go.
[03:37:31.422 --> 03:37:31.802]  We're good to go.
[03:37:31.822 --> 03:37:32.623]  We're good to go.
[03:37:32.643 --> 03:37:33.083]  We're good to go.
[03:37:33.123 --> 03:37:33.664]  We're good to go.
[03:37:33.684 --> 03:37:34.565]  We're good to go.
[03:37:34.605 --> 03:37:35.205]  We're good to go.
[03:37:35.225 --> 03:37:35.725]  We're good to go.
[03:37:35.766 --> 03:37:36.426]  We're good to go.
[03:37:36.466 --> 03:37:37.467]  We're good to go.
[03:37:37.487 --> 03:37:37.947]  We're good to go.
[03:37:37.967 --> 03:37:38.808]  We're good to go.
[03:37:38.848 --> 03:37:39.268]  We're good to go.
[03:37:39.308 --> 03:37:39.729]  We're good to go.
[03:37:39.769 --> 03:37:40.769]  We're good to go.
[03:37:40.789 --> 03:37:41.930]  We're good to go.
[03:37:41.950 --> 03:37:42.911]  We're good to go.
[03:37:42.991 --> 03:37:43.652]  We're good to go.
[03:37:43.692 --> 03:37:44.292]  We're good to go.
[03:37:44.312 --> 03:37:45.173]  We're good to go.
[03:37:45.193 --> 03:37:45.613]  We're good to go.
[03:37:45.633 --> 03:37:46.354]  We're good to go.
[03:37:46.394 --> 03:37:47.655]  We're good to go.
[03:37:47.675 --> 03:37:48.355]  We're good to go.
[03:37:48.375 --> 03:37:48.876]  We're good to go.
[03:37:48.916 --> 03:37:49.316]  We're good to go.
[03:37:49.396 --> 03:37:49.556]  We're
[03:37:50.757 --> 03:37:53.559]  But let's go ahead and go to James in Washington.
[03:37:53.719 --> 03:37:54.359]  Go ahead, James.
[03:37:55.440 --> 03:37:57.321]  Hey, guys.
[03:37:57.381 --> 03:37:57.882]  How you doing?
[03:37:58.262 --> 03:37:58.642]  Doing good.
[03:37:58.662 --> 03:37:59.002]  Yourself?
[03:38:01.024 --> 03:38:01.844]  Pretty good, man.
[03:38:01.984 --> 03:38:02.945]  Hey, Joe Biggs.
[03:38:02.965 --> 03:38:04.306]  I just want to say God bless, man.
[03:38:04.406 --> 03:38:06.427]  You remind me of my best friend, Mike.
[03:38:06.447 --> 03:38:10.710]  He's like a brother I'd like to hang out with up here if you ever come up in Seattle.
[03:38:11.721 --> 03:38:14.542]  Well Joe Biggs left us too, I guess I should have mentioned that as well.
[03:38:14.802 --> 03:38:17.423]  But I'm sure he can hear you and he appreciates your call.
[03:38:17.463 --> 03:38:18.663]  Thank you so much, James.
[03:38:19.043 --> 03:38:20.764]  Alright, so we took one call there.
[03:38:21.004 --> 03:38:22.665]  Let's go ahead and go to another video.
[03:38:22.685 --> 03:38:23.845]  This is Trey Gowdy.
[03:38:24.345 --> 03:38:29.447]  And Trey Gowdy is grilling DHS officials on due process oversight and reform committee.
[03:38:29.807 --> 03:38:34.409]  Because, yeah, we have all these DHS guys that we're talking about guys on no-fly list, no-gun-by list.
[03:38:34.969 --> 03:38:37.870]  We've also seen, I believe it was 72 people from DHS.
[03:38:38.510 --> 03:38:41.832]  On the no-fly list, I wonder how seriously that's going to be enforced.
[03:38:42.132 --> 03:38:44.613]  So if the guys are ready, we can go ahead and run that clip.
[03:38:45.994 --> 03:38:48.395]  Let me ask you another question about the terrorism list.
[03:38:48.855 --> 03:38:51.557]  What process is afforded a U.S.
[03:38:51.597 --> 03:39:02.963]  citizen, not someone who's overstayed a visa, not someone who crossed the border without permission, but an American citizen, what process is currently afforded an American citizen before they go on that list?
[03:39:08.257 --> 03:39:14.300]  I'm sorry, there's not a process afforded the citizen prior to getting on the list.
[03:39:14.320 --> 03:39:18.482]  There is a process, should someone feel they are unduly placed on the list.
[03:39:18.502 --> 03:39:19.503]  Yes, there is.
[03:39:19.663 --> 03:39:31.769]  And when I say process, I'm actually using half of the term due process, which is a phrase we find in the Constitution, that you cannot deprive people of certain things without due process.
[03:39:32.589 --> 03:39:41.258]  So, I understand Mr. Goode's idea, which is wait until your right has been taken from you, and then you can petition the government to get it back.
[03:39:41.478 --> 03:39:43.240]  I understand that that's his idea.
[03:39:44.021 --> 03:39:53.630]  My question is, can you name another constitutional right that we have that is chilled until you find out it's chilled, and then you have to petition the government to get it back?
[03:39:55.032 --> 03:39:56.333]  Is that true with the First Amendment?
[03:39:58.502 --> 03:40:02.124]  Sir, there are strict criteria before... That's not my question, ma'am.
[03:40:02.304 --> 03:40:03.504]  That is not my question.
[03:40:03.545 --> 03:40:12.949]  My question is, what process is afforded a United States citizen before that person's constitutional right is infringed?
[03:40:13.830 --> 03:40:16.191]  And he's fine with doing it with the Second Amendment.
[03:40:16.471 --> 03:40:18.052]  My question is, how about the first?
[03:40:19.052 --> 03:40:24.435]  How about we not let him set up a website or a Google account?
[03:40:25.660 --> 03:40:31.105]  How about we not let them join the church until they can petition government to get off the list?
[03:40:32.266 --> 03:40:33.387]  How about not get a lawyer?
[03:40:34.108 --> 03:40:35.329]  How about the 6th Amendment?
[03:40:35.629 --> 03:40:41.234]  How about you can't get a lawyer until you petition the government to get off the list?
[03:40:42.395 --> 03:40:44.157]  Or my favorite, how about the 8th Amendment?
[03:40:45.117 --> 03:40:50.979]  We're going to subject you to cruel and unusual punishment until you petition the government to get off the list.
[03:40:51.419 --> 03:40:58.541]  Is there another constitutional right that we treat the same way for American citizens that we do in the Second Amendment?
[03:40:58.561 --> 03:40:59.401]  Can you think of one?
[03:41:03.603 --> 03:41:04.303]  And she sits there.
[03:41:04.643 --> 03:41:05.483]  Can you think of one?
[03:41:06.264 --> 03:41:07.504]  I don't have an answer for you, sir.
[03:41:09.161 --> 03:41:10.422]  That was awesome!
[03:41:10.962 --> 03:41:12.223]  I really enjoyed that.
[03:41:12.243 --> 03:41:15.386]  Great job to you, Trey Gowdy, grilling these guys.
[03:41:15.426 --> 03:41:16.266]  Because, yeah, that's what it is.
[03:41:16.286 --> 03:41:18.408]  That's what I was talking about with Biggs early on.
[03:41:18.888 --> 03:41:23.052]  This no-fly, no-gun-by list and all these other watch lists they have people on.
[03:41:23.512 --> 03:41:27.455]  At the time, you don't even know that you're on it until, you know, you get stuck at the airport or some other thing.
[03:41:27.475 --> 03:41:28.336]  Then you have to petition.
[03:41:28.616 --> 03:41:30.757]  And as you can see right there, well, what's the petition process?
[03:41:30.777 --> 03:41:31.538]  What are you supposed to do?
[03:41:31.898 --> 03:41:33.520]  A lot of times, they don't have an answer.
[03:41:33.880 --> 03:41:34.941]  Once again, the number to call in, 800-259-9231.
[03:41:38.403 --> 03:41:41.164]  That is 800-259-9231.
[03:41:41.445 --> 03:41:43.566]  Let's go ahead and talk to Luke in Washington.
[03:41:43.766 --> 03:41:44.286]  Go ahead, Luke.
[03:41:46.547 --> 03:41:48.928]  Hi, thank you for having me on here.
[03:41:49.268 --> 03:41:49.548]  Thank you.
[03:41:49.588 --> 03:42:01.954]  So I'm on YouTube right now and I see the Alex Jones channel and I see that Melissa Harris Perry called Star Wars film racist and I think that just shows kind of where our country is really going.
[03:42:02.614 --> 03:42:04.055]  Every film in the world
[03:42:05.103 --> 03:42:12.490]  In the future, if it displays a black man or black woman getting killed, it's going to be claimed as racist.
[03:42:12.650 --> 03:42:15.232]  That's what Melissa Harris Perry is going to just try and do.
[03:42:15.412 --> 03:42:22.018]  Claim every future film that shows any black man, any black woman getting killed is a racist film.
[03:42:22.038 --> 03:42:22.679]  And that's just a joke.
[03:42:27.731 --> 03:42:44.806]  Well I hear what you're saying because I believe what she was referring to like it was a long clip we played it yesterday I'm not gonna play it again but she was talking about you know how Darth Vader was evil until he became white he took off the Darth Vader suit and became white even though if you go watch episode 3 you know Anakin's evil and killing a bunch of kids in a library but I guess that doesn't mean anything
[03:42:45.166 --> 03:42:48.828]  And I also saw an interview with James Earl Jones done several years ago.
[03:42:48.848 --> 03:42:56.592]  He was talking about when he got cast for the film, because you can go watch DVD bonus features of the actor in the suit saying the lines.
[03:42:56.872 --> 03:42:58.113]  He doesn't sound intimidating at all.
[03:42:58.133 --> 03:43:02.395]  I'm sure he's a fantastic actor, but he doesn't have that James Earl Jones type of voice.
[03:43:02.775 --> 03:43:12.180]  So James Earl Jones was saying that, yeah, George Lucas wanted a voice that was darker, not racially darker, but just darker, more intense, more intimidating than what we saw there.
[03:43:12.200 --> 03:43:13.861]  But yeah, I hear what you're saying there, Luke.
[03:43:14.381 --> 03:43:20.222]  I think there is going to be a lot of people who just like anything, you know, if a black person is a villain in a movie, they'll say it's racist or whatever.
[03:43:20.242 --> 03:43:22.623]  So I definitely understand what you're saying right there.
[03:43:23.103 --> 03:43:24.763]  Let's go ahead and go back to another clip now.
[03:43:25.263 --> 03:43:37.666]  We have Obama's undersecretary of the Army, nominee secretary of the Army, and he's talking about ISIS is not contained because we've seen Obama previously state that ISIS was the JV team, that they're not a threat.
[03:43:38.086 --> 03:43:39.786]  He's releasing guys from Guantanamo Bay.
[03:43:40.186 --> 03:43:40.766]  We're good to go.
[03:44:04.229 --> 03:44:04.529]  Sorry.
[03:44:05.149 --> 03:44:06.350]  It's live teleprompter media.
[03:44:06.390 --> 03:44:07.210]  Jakari's kicking butt.
[03:44:07.470 --> 03:44:09.391]  I cannot wait until tonight when you guys are hosts of the news.
[03:44:09.711 --> 03:44:10.511]  I'll be part of it with you.
[03:44:10.531 --> 03:44:12.192]  We've got huge debate coverage coming up.
[03:44:12.212 --> 03:44:13.432]  I'm about to do a Facebook Mentions.
[03:44:13.772 --> 03:44:15.413]  Coming up in about 10-15 minutes, Jakari.
[03:44:15.613 --> 03:44:15.853]  Alright.
[03:44:15.873 --> 03:44:17.093]  You've done a wonderful job this year.
[03:44:17.113 --> 03:44:18.014]  So have the viewers and listeners.
[03:44:18.314 --> 03:44:20.134]  About to go sign your Christmas bonus check, Jakari.
[03:44:20.194 --> 03:44:21.075]  That is awesome.
[03:44:21.115 --> 03:44:22.355]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:44:22.935 --> 03:44:24.936]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[03:44:25.256 --> 03:44:27.937]  And this is Mr. Murphy, the Undersecretary.
[03:44:30.168 --> 03:44:30.968]  Well, thank you all.
[03:44:32.729 --> 03:44:35.911]  Carson Murphy, is ISIS contained?
[03:44:38.372 --> 03:44:46.876]  Well, Senator, I'm not currently, as you know, in government, but let me tell you what I know from my personal perspective, Mr. Chairman.
[03:44:47.476 --> 03:44:50.938]  When you look at things like the Russian airliners... I'm going to start out by saying yes or no.
[03:44:52.705 --> 03:45:08.625]  I would say no because, Mr. Chairman, when you look at things like the Russian airliner, when you look at things like the Paris attack which killed civilians, when you look at things like the ISIL-inspired attack in California, when you look at ISIL operations currently in Ramadi and Mosul.
[03:45:09.847 --> 03:45:12.030]  I'm concerned, as we all are concerned.
[03:45:12.350 --> 03:45:20.962]  And we must, and I think Secretary Carter and General Milley have said that we must accelerate our prosecution in the war against ISIL immediately.
[03:45:21.563 --> 03:45:25.749]  And if confirmed, Mr. Chairman, I will do just that to make sure we take the fight to them.
[03:45:27.336 --> 03:45:30.657]  And yes, I do agree that ISIS is a threat and they need to be dealt with.
[03:45:30.697 --> 03:45:37.818]  The issue that very few people are talking about outside of Rand Paul is that we keep funding ISIS, we keep funding Al Qaeda.
[03:45:38.118 --> 03:45:43.139]  Everybody wants to go blow them up, but nobody wants to cut off the funding and make them an easier target to attack.
[03:45:43.459 --> 03:45:45.520]  Let's go ahead and talk to Larry in Michigan.
[03:45:45.560 --> 03:45:46.140]  Go ahead, Larry.
[03:45:51.081 --> 03:45:51.301]  Larry?
[03:45:52.779 --> 03:45:54.140]  Okay, I guess we lost Larry there.
[03:45:54.560 --> 03:45:57.061]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Ohio.
[03:45:57.281 --> 03:45:57.801]  Go ahead, Tim.
[03:45:59.262 --> 03:46:00.482]  Hey, Jakari, how you doing?
[03:46:00.682 --> 03:46:01.183]  Doing good, sir.
[03:46:01.203 --> 03:46:01.503]  Yourself?
[03:46:02.443 --> 03:46:02.723]  Good.
[03:46:03.384 --> 03:46:14.909]  Hey, isn't it funny how when Trump made that statement about the illegal, or the bringing in the jihadis, that all those people in the establishment come out against him.
[03:46:14.989 --> 03:46:19.931]  Well, doesn't that just go to show how much they don't represent us when his polls go up?
[03:46:21.459 --> 03:46:36.326]  Well, the issue is, you know, like I said, I'm not a fan of everything Trump says and does, but, you know, going back to the old Rand Paul example, you know, everybody wants to come out and say, let's bomb ISIS, but nobody wants to talk about the root of the problem, saying that we're funding ISIS.
[03:46:36.346 --> 03:46:39.387]  Like, I haven't heard people, I haven't heard Trump really talk about that either.
[03:46:39.767 --> 03:46:41.709]  So I'm not so much on the Trump campaign.
[03:46:41.749 --> 03:46:50.076]  I do hear what you're saying, that anytime he says something, they do seem to attack him more than they would a Hillary Clinton or a, you know, Bernie Sanders, a character like that.
[03:46:50.376 --> 03:46:53.779]  So I hear some of what you're saying, but I'm not completely on the Trump bandwagon.
[03:46:56.061 --> 03:47:05.489]  And you know how right after that happened, Obama come out and said, you know, we gotta, you know, somebody on a no-fly list should not be able to buy a gun when this guy wasn't even on.
[03:47:05.829 --> 03:47:07.350]  These guys weren't even on a no-fly list.
[03:47:07.470 --> 03:47:08.011]  That is correct.
[03:47:09.093 --> 03:47:12.916]  Yeah, and it shows you they just keep grasping at straws.
[03:47:12.956 --> 03:47:18.340]  You know, even with the Boston bombing, you had a pressure cooker filled with all types of nails, whatever else was in there.
[03:47:18.380 --> 03:47:20.101]  Then they'd use that to try to ban guns.
[03:47:20.441 --> 03:47:22.003]  You know, it's just a complete lunacy.
[03:47:22.303 --> 03:47:30.329]  They'll use any example they can to come after guns, even though, as we all know, they themselves are surrounded by bodyguards and have all that stuff going on them.
[03:47:30.649 --> 03:47:32.590]  Well, thank you so much for calling in.
[03:47:32.951 --> 03:47:34.372]  Let's go back to another clip.
[03:47:34.412 --> 03:47:37.174]  We have Obama defending his Guantanamo policy.
[03:47:37.774 --> 03:47:41.156]  Calling for the release of low-level detainees and downplaying the threat.
[03:47:41.517 --> 03:47:49.962]  As we already referenced earlier in the show, Obama used to say that ISIS was the JV team and not to be, you know, any concern to anybody.
[03:47:49.982 --> 03:47:58.548]  We're just going to airdrop grenades and then have our, you know, colonels, generals or whoever the guy made the statement that one crate or one pallet of grenades isn't going to defeat the U.S.
[03:47:58.588 --> 03:47:58.968]  military.
[03:47:59.228 --> 03:48:05.372]  Yes, I do agree it's not going to defeat the United States military, but it's going to kill a whole bunch of unarmed civilians out there in Syria.
[03:48:05.593 --> 03:48:07.534]  Let's go ahead and look at this clip from Obama.
[03:48:08.915 --> 03:48:25.888]  Well, first of all, just in terms of Guantanamo policy generally, I am absolutely persuaded, as are my top intelligence and military advisors, that Guantanamo is used as a recruitment tool for organizations like ISIS.
[03:48:26.048 --> 03:48:29.951]  And if we want to fight them, then we can't give them these kinds of excuses.
[03:48:31.732 --> 03:48:34.034]  In terms of any kind of
[03:48:35.413 --> 03:48:35.894]  We're good.
[03:48:52.390 --> 03:49:07.216]  Four, five, six hundred people that get released that a handful of them are going to be embittered and still engaging in anti-US activities and trying to link up potentially with their old organizations.
[03:49:07.996 --> 03:49:19.347]  The judgment that we're continually making is, are there individuals who are significantly more dangerous than the people who are already out there, who are fighting?
[03:49:19.707 --> 03:49:20.368]  What do they have?
[03:49:20.388 --> 03:49:21.509]  Do they have special skills?
[03:49:21.589 --> 03:49:28.435]  Do they have special knowledge that ends up making them a significant threat to the United States?
[03:49:30.616 --> 03:49:47.879]  And so, the bottom line is that the strategic gains we make by closing Guantanamo will outweigh those low-level individuals who have been released so far.
[03:49:49.259 --> 03:49:54.701]  Alright, so there you go, President Obama with his latest statement, or one of his later statements.
[03:49:54.961 --> 03:49:56.601]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nick in Michigan.
[03:49:56.641 --> 03:49:57.161]  Go ahead, Nick.
[03:49:59.582 --> 03:50:02.563]  I do, I'm a big fan, big fan of Joe's too.
[03:50:03.043 --> 03:50:03.624]  Oh, thank you.
[03:50:05.244 --> 03:50:09.606]  I just got something to say to veterans and people in the military that have gotten out.
[03:50:09.746 --> 03:50:16.969]  It's still your duty to support and defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States, specifically the Second Amendment.
[03:50:17.229 --> 03:50:21.591]  Everybody that is trained and can legally own firearms should.
[03:50:21.611 --> 03:50:24.252]  And I have a question for Joe.
[03:50:24.332 --> 03:50:25.172]  Is he still right there?
[03:50:25.453 --> 03:50:26.453]  Oh no, he stepped out.
[03:50:28.098 --> 03:50:30.199]  Oh, okay, alright.
[03:50:30.219 --> 03:50:31.659]  Well, that's it then.
[03:50:31.679 --> 03:50:34.360]  I have a little brother who's looking to join the Marine Corps.
[03:50:34.380 --> 03:50:38.462]  I was wondering if Joe has any advice to give to him.
[03:50:39.062 --> 03:50:39.442]  Okay.
[03:50:39.582 --> 03:50:41.043]  Well, I'm sure you can find him on Twitter.
[03:50:41.063 --> 03:50:45.924]  He's a very social butterfly, Rambo Biggs, on Twitter, and you can ask him your questions there.
[03:50:45.965 --> 03:50:47.065]  Thank you so much, Nick.
[03:50:47.105 --> 03:50:47.965]  We're going to go to break now.
[03:50:48.005 --> 03:50:48.525]  We'll be back.
[03:50:48.745 --> 03:50:52.247]  Don't forget, the debate's coming up tonight, live coverage starting at 7 p.m.
[03:50:52.307 --> 03:50:52.627]  Central.
[03:51:10.771 --> 03:51:12.672]  My name is Don Whiskin.
[03:51:12.752 --> 03:51:17.014]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:17.715 --> 03:51:21.517]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:51:21.717 --> 03:51:22.858]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:23.278 --> 03:51:26.720]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:51:27.360 --> 03:51:31.662]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:51:31.942 --> 03:51:32.783]  He waited too long.
[03:51:33.223 --> 03:51:36.244]  In June, that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:36.564 --> 03:51:37.225]  What did I do?
[03:51:37.465 --> 03:51:44.708]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call ExtendoVite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.
[03:51:44.908 --> 03:51:53.071]  Based on German studies of natural medicine, ExtendoVite is designed to clear blocked arteries, clean the toxins from your blood, and improve your immune system.
[03:51:53.351 --> 03:51:55.112]  To get your XtendoVite, call 1-877-928-8822.

[03:52:13.226 --> 03:52:14.426]  Day in and day out.
[03:52:14.586 --> 03:52:18.088]  Exposing the ludicrous lies and criminal operations of the globalists.
[03:52:18.268 --> 03:52:20.269]  And we're starting to see big effects.
[03:52:20.589 --> 03:52:22.130]  And the word is getting out.
[03:52:22.490 --> 03:52:24.371]  The globalists want to make us dependent.
[03:52:24.571 --> 03:52:27.953]  And as Napoleon famously said, an army marches on its stomach.
[03:52:28.293 --> 03:52:31.835]  Ammunition, food and supplies form the backbone of any offensive.
[03:52:32.115 --> 03:52:33.235]  Including the Info War.
[03:52:33.775 --> 03:52:36.737]  And our enemies admit they're losing the Info War.
[03:52:36.997 --> 03:52:40.561]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[03:52:40.741 --> 03:52:47.048]  With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse any money from globalists or government.
[03:52:47.248 --> 03:52:53.975]  We are funding our crusade against tyranny the old-fashioned way, with pure free-market, free-will capitalism.

[03:54:10.015 --> 03:54:21.441]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:21.501 --> 03:54:22.841]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[03:54:22.881 --> 03:54:25.523]  This is the final segment of the Overdrive Hour.
[03:54:25.543 --> 03:54:30.485]  And before we get to our topics here, I want to remind you about the great specials in the InfoWars shop.
[03:54:30.865 --> 03:54:33.807]  Right now, the ProPure water filtration systems are 25% off.
[03:54:34.027 --> 03:54:38.049]  You can get the ProPure Traveler, the King, all the good stuff right there.
[03:54:39.392 --> 03:54:48.395]  25% off and don't forget we have free shipping going on right now and you have three more days left to guarantee your shipping here in the United States by Christmas time.
[03:54:48.415 --> 03:54:50.475]  So you definitely want to do that and get on that right away.
[03:54:50.935 --> 03:55:02.999]  And while we talk about things like water filtration systems, because besides the Harvard studies saying that they lower your IQ when you have things like fluoride in the water and then you go to the city council meeting and the mayor gives you the finger.
[03:55:03.359 --> 03:55:12.208]  We now have this new article coming out of Flint, Michigan, where they have so much lead in the water that it's giving kids sicknesses and they've declared a state of emergency.
[03:55:12.228 --> 03:55:24.581]  And it says, according to the World Health Organization, lead affects children's brain development, resulting in reduced IQs, behavioral changes, and shortening of attention spans and increased antisocial behavior.
[03:55:25.242 --> 03:55:38.959]  The article goes on to say, the proportion of infants and children with above average levels of lead in their blood has nearly doubled since the city switched from the Detroit water system to using the Flint River as their water source in 2014.
[03:55:40.601 --> 03:55:43.804]  So this is why it's important to have clean, pure water.
[03:55:44.365 --> 03:55:46.386]  You don't want to get things like dental fluorosis.
[03:55:46.426 --> 03:55:48.108]  You don't want your kids to have lead poisoning.
[03:55:48.448 --> 03:55:51.811]  You know, because you think about the old saying, you know, must be something in the water.
[03:55:51.871 --> 03:55:58.197]  You would usually reserve that when you see some big, strong, you know, muscly football guys running around, you know, running guys over.
[03:55:58.217 --> 03:55:59.398]  That must be something in the water.
[03:55:59.678 --> 03:56:01.400]  Now when you see some sick kid, you know, who's
[03:56:01.900 --> 03:56:02.300]  Hi, thank you.
[03:56:25.601 --> 03:56:30.344]  I just recently finished watching the Kate Griggs videos on YouTube.
[03:56:30.624 --> 03:56:34.708]  The title of the video is Ex-Illuminati Wife Tells All or something like that.
[03:56:35.388 --> 03:56:38.310]  And I was just wondering if you had seen those videos.
[03:56:38.651 --> 03:56:41.093]  I have not.
[03:56:41.133 --> 03:56:43.414]  Go ahead.
[03:56:43.434 --> 03:56:49.839]  She was married to a colonel in the Marine Corps, George Griggs, and she just, I mean, what she exposes is so
[03:56:51.064 --> 03:57:02.115]  Incredible, and I was just wondering if maybe Jo had heard about her... I mean, she just talks about crazy rituals and killings and satanic stuff, and I...
[03:57:02.691 --> 03:57:05.752]  I just didn't know if you had seen the four videos on YouTube.
[03:57:06.132 --> 03:57:10.352]  No, I have not seen those, but you know, I can believe stories like that do happen.
[03:57:10.392 --> 03:57:14.593]  We've seen guys like Jimmy Savelle and, you know, all the weird stuff that goes on at Bohemian Grove.
[03:57:14.893 --> 03:57:18.734]  There are definitely people who are into that kind of, you know, weird stuff.
[03:57:18.754 --> 03:57:23.475]  I'm not exactly sure how far those tapes go that you're referring to, but I can't believe that people do stuff like that.
[03:57:23.915 --> 03:57:24.715]  Thank you so much, Shelley.
[03:57:24.755 --> 03:57:26.975]  Let's go on to Thomas in Texas.
[03:57:27.015 --> 03:57:27.355]  Go ahead.
[03:57:28.936 --> 03:57:29.236]  Hello?
[03:57:29.736 --> 03:57:29.896]  Yes.
[03:57:31.124 --> 03:57:42.813]  Hey sir, so I was, Caller brought up earlier about South Park, this current season with South Park, how they're using TC and they're really describing how TC is being used as a weapon.
[03:57:43.113 --> 03:57:44.734]  Have you watched South Park at all?
[03:57:44.754 --> 03:57:45.555]  Have you seen the season?
[03:57:45.615 --> 03:57:47.136]  I don't watch South Park regularly.
[03:57:47.196 --> 03:57:49.378]  Every now and then we'll post one of the clips on the site.
[03:57:49.418 --> 03:57:58.625]  Like I saw the Safe Space one, they had like Steven Seagal and Vin Diesel and some, and you know, I get the point that they're trying to make, yeah, so I'm aware of them.
[03:57:59.764 --> 03:58:08.053]  Yeah, there was a point where they actually completely broke it down, where PC is actually being used as a weapon to bring in ISIS.
[03:58:08.674 --> 03:58:12.078]  And I think it's great that Comedy Central, yeah, they have been
[03:58:13.107 --> 03:58:14.068]  I think so.
[03:58:30.563 --> 03:58:31.503]  Yes, well, thank you so much.
[03:58:31.523 --> 03:58:32.744]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Thomas.
[03:58:32.784 --> 03:58:33.704]  We are out of time.
[03:58:33.744 --> 03:58:39.206]  I want to remind everybody about our debate coverage coming up tonight, live, right here in this studio, 7 p.m.
[03:58:39.246 --> 03:58:39.586]  Central.

[03:58:59.896 --> 03:59:04.313]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world prayed
