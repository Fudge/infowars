[00:00:10.407 --> 00:00:14.651]  Yesterday, we brought you the news about a mass shooting, a campus shooting in Kenya.
[00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:22.158]  The terrorist group Al-Shabaab opened fire at Garissa University College and killed nearly 150 people.
[00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:29.846]  Fox News reported the men were going door to door asking people their religion and if they answered they were a Christian, they shot them on the spot.
[00:00:30.592 --> 00:00:33.934]  The first responders engaged the terrorists, but were flat-out outgunned.
[00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:39.138]  Al-Shabaab is the same group that attacked a mall in Nairobi years ago, killing many innocent people.
[00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.080]  And now they're threatening attacks here on U.S.
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.922]  soil, threatening the Mall of America.
[00:00:44.262 --> 00:00:47.804]  DHS has investigated the group and found them to be no credible threat.
[00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:49.285]  And I hope they're right.
[00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:54.029]  But if they're wrong, I'm very happy that we live in a country where we have concealed carriers.
[00:00:55.267 --> 00:00:57.388]  He kept pulling the charging handle and hitting the side.
[00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:01.531]  The break in gunfire allowed Mealy to pull out his own gun.
[00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:08.075]  I saw someone in the back of the Charlotte move, and I knew that if I fired and missed, I could end up hitting them.
[00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:10.616]  So Mealy took cover inside a nearby store.
[00:01:10.797 --> 00:01:19.802]  I'm not beating myself up because I didn't shoot him, but I know that after he saw me, I think the last shot he fired was the one that he used on himself.
[00:01:20.062 --> 00:01:20.983]  The gunman was dead.
[00:01:22.065 --> 00:01:27.654]  And in the Clackamas shooting, the mere sight of armed opposition forced the gunman to turn the gun upon himself.
[00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:30.679]  I guess he didn't want to take the chance of being taken alive.
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.485]  And now we're all asking the same question, how do we combat these mass shootings?
[00:01:35.213 --> 00:01:39.156]  Well, the chief of Interpol has come out and said, well, maybe we should just arm the citizens.
[00:01:39.416 --> 00:01:41.177]  The people should be able to protect themselves.
[00:01:41.317 --> 00:01:42.118]  And I do agree.
[00:01:42.518 --> 00:01:45.561]  Now, am I trying to put a firearm in every dorm room in America?
[00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:45.841]  No.
[00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:55.548]  But if you're somebody of age, of sound mind and body, and you don't have any criminal proceedings, I think you should be able to go out and purchase a gun to keep yourself safe.
[00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:58.210]  But not everybody agrees with this point of view.
[00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.334]  And there are now actually articles out debunking the effectiveness of armed citizens.
[00:02:03.914 --> 00:02:11.701]  I have some self-defense stories here and for the purposes of this report I restricted this to public people in public places and not private individuals in their homes.
[00:02:12.502 --> 00:02:14.304]  We'll start with this one back in 2012.
[00:02:15.224 --> 00:02:17.106]  Two robbers enter an internet cafe.
[00:02:17.206 --> 00:02:19.929]  One's holding a bat, the other one has a pistol.
[00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.513]  He jumps up with his own pistol, shoots at the robbers and chases them out.
[00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:26.422]  Like the rats that they are.
[00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:28.723]  You see, guy's scary and pretty pathetic.
[00:02:29.344 --> 00:02:30.104]  But he saved the day.
[00:02:30.685 --> 00:02:32.446]  Another story from Wisconsin.
[00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:36.749]  A gentleman pulls out his concealed carry and then shoots this guy once the coast is clear.
[00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.613]  Gas station clerk thwarted robbery fired for violating company's no weapons policy.
[00:02:42.654 --> 00:02:46.736]  So this guy, he saved himself and the people in the store but he lost his job unfortunately.
[00:02:46.756 --> 00:02:49.719]  Another story out of Philadelphia.
[00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:52.160]  Barbershop patron shoots gunman dead.
[00:02:53.231 --> 00:02:55.254]  Armed robber no match for pharmacist with a 45.
[00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:59.660]  And there are videos accompanying most of these articles I'm showing you.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.204]  We're just skipping them for the sake of time, but you're welcome to go back
[00:03:02.614 --> 00:03:03.494]  Look at them for yourself.
[00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:06.936]  Woman fends off would-be attackers with concealed gun.
[00:03:07.476 --> 00:03:09.858]  And this is a bank employee with a concealed carry.
[00:03:09.878 --> 00:03:11.758]  Shoots would-be robber in the jaw.
[00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:13.399]  Another bank story.
[00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:17.421]  Bank customer thwarts robbery after returning to car to grab gun.
[00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:19.002]  And we'll end with this one.
[00:03:19.362 --> 00:03:22.143]  India's first gun for women fares well among men.
[00:03:22.183 --> 00:03:25.685]  And this was in response to the Delhi gang rape of 2012.
[00:03:27.566 --> 00:03:27.906]  We're good to go.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.121]  I don't want to debunk that and just tell them to go look at this.
[00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:50.342]  There are several other examples.
[00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:52.883]  Like I said, you can see videos of people in their home.
[00:03:52.923 --> 00:04:03.830]  There are way more than I can pull up for either one of these cases, but keep this in mind as we go forward and hopefully we can diminish these gun-free zones and get rid of these soft targets.
[00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.552]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
