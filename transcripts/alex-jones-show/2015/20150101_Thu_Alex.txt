[00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:03.132]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:04.013 --> 00:00:12.100]  Oh, baby!
[00:00:29.418 --> 00:00:34.282]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're starting the new year off here right.
[00:00:35.663 --> 00:00:36.964]  With a little bit of Moby.
[00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:45.770]  I'm your host Alex Jones, and this is a very special first transmission, or the kickoff of 2015.
[00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:46.531]  January 1st, 2015.
[00:00:51.963 --> 00:00:53.525]  I would stand in line for this.
[00:00:53.746 --> 00:00:54.947]  It's so good to be here.
[00:00:54.967 --> 00:01:03.279]  I remember growing up in a little house by Wattrock Lake in Dallas and hearing my mother talk about the year 2001.
[00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:04.280]  The new millennium.
[00:01:08.217 --> 00:01:15.482]  Because she was right, 2001 will be the start of the new millennium, not 2000, but little did she know that they would just say, oh, it's just 2000.
[00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:18.144]  When 2000 starts, it's the new millennium.
[00:01:18.224 --> 00:01:20.946]  No, 2001 is the new millennium.
[00:01:21.346 --> 00:01:32.674]  2000 is the completion, when it ends, of the second thousand years after Christ's birth and death.
[00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:36.477]  I guess now they just call it common era, but
[00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:40.025]  Here we are now, 15 years.
[00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:41.706]  We're starting the 15th year.
[00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:49.773]  So we're technically 14 years into this new millennium.
[00:01:50.374 --> 00:01:51.474]  Simply amazing.
[00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:53.536]  And we'll blank, it'll be 2030.
[00:01:54.277 --> 00:01:57.079]  Think about that.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.565]  When this much time has passed, plus a year, but rounding up, that it's taken to get from 2000 to now,
[00:02:07.597 --> 00:02:07.957]  It'll be 2030.
[00:02:08.177 --> 00:02:12.980]  Oh yeah, it'll be Buck Rogers then, won't it?
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.463]  It's already Buck Rogers, and they're keeping secret much of what's going on.
[00:02:17.523 --> 00:02:21.745]  We are living in ultra-epic times.
[00:02:22.165 --> 00:02:23.486]  Everything is so interesting.
[00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:25.107]  Everything is so amazing.
[00:02:25.527 --> 00:02:26.528]  So much is happening.
[00:02:26.868 --> 00:02:33.372]  The only people you hear that are bored and unhappy are folks that still believe in and watch mainstream news and television.
[00:02:34.677 --> 00:02:40.121]  They think what comes out of that box, that controlled corporate gloveless box, is the sum total of the universe!
[00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:45.485]  I'm here to tell you what comes out of this little box is... tiny!
[00:02:46.516 --> 00:02:49.519]  Compared to the universe, but a lot bigger than what the mainstream media has to offer.
[00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:55.545]  They want to keep you shuttered, and your doorways of perception to control you and your family.
[00:02:56.065 --> 00:03:05.655]  And I'm not here to tell you what to think, I'm here to tell you, you might want to look around, you might want to understand, you can come out of the cave, the allegory of Plato, and there's a whole wide world.
[00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:30.233]  And then there's mountains to climb, and rockets to ascend in, and deep sea operations, and exploring the mind, and exploring music, and poetry, and honor, and relationships, and birth, and life, and marriage, and children, and death, and the elite merging with machines, and brain chips, and just, it's incredible!
[00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:34.916]  Dystopia meets utopia meets reality.
[00:03:36.977 --> 00:03:56.789]  So instead of just airing a few of the interviews we've had the last few weeks, that are great rebroadcasts we do occasionally on Christmas or other holidays, on New Year's Day, I was live on New Year's, on New Year's Day the crew from the TV side and the radio side have done a great job putting together a little snippet of one of the two Charlton Heston interviews I did, the one we can find.
[00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:02.933]  It's bad audio, but the info is interesting to hear that champion of the Second Amendment once more on the broadcast.
[00:04:03.925 --> 00:04:11.787]  David de Rothschild, a globalist, who says that Mars is closer to the Sun than Earth, and other such insanities.
[00:04:12.787 --> 00:04:13.887]  Well, he just thinks you're dumb.
[00:04:14.867 --> 00:04:19.788]  Viggo Mortensen, one of my favorite big actors, is a listener, and he was on the broadcast.
[00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.869]  Joe Rogan, old-time friend on him since, like, 1998.
[00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:24.249]  See, time flies.
[00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.050]  Mike Judge, of course, the creator of King of the Hill, Beavis, and Butthead, and more.
[00:04:29.431 --> 00:04:30.871]  Talks Tea Party, New World Order.
[00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:39.175]  Rowdy Rowdy Piper needs no introduction of They Live with Sean Stone, Willie Nelson, an old blast from the past, and Russell Brand.
[00:04:39.435 --> 00:04:49.620]  When I said let's get together some of the most interesting celebrity interviews I've done, the list was a lot longer than this, so we're gonna have some more of these coming up in the future, but this is a first look at it.
[00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:56.238]  Doesn't have a lot of great folks there like Dave Mustaine or Billy Corgan or so many others or Charlie Sheen for that matter.
[00:04:56.818 --> 00:04:59.360]  But they'll be in the next round of this coming up.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:07.884]  But straight ahead, Charlton Heston, David Rothschild, Viggo Mortensen, Joe Rogan, Mike Judge, Rowdy Rowdy Piper, Willie Nelson and more.
[00:05:08.105 --> 00:05:08.525]  Stay with us.
[00:05:10.026 --> 00:05:12.609]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:13.850]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[00:05:14.131 --> 00:05:15.612]  Even with diet and exercise.
[00:05:15.813 --> 00:05:20.858]  Because of toxic food and our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[00:05:20.998 --> 00:05:27.826]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[00:05:28.146 --> 00:05:30.129]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.
[00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.980]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.130]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining three essential formulations.
[00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:51.335]  Oxygen-Based Cleanser Oxy Powder, The Secret 12 Bioavailable Vitamin B12, and your choice of Super Female or Super Male Vitality.

[00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:13.604]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:06:13.764 --> 00:06:17.725]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:19.505]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:19.825 --> 00:06:27.407]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[00:08:06.478 --> 00:08:07.938]  A decision is being made by the President
[00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:22.241]  And the Joint Chiefs in the War Room at the Pentagon.
[00:08:22.841 --> 00:08:29.446]  And when they realize there is no possibility of recalling the wing, there'll be only one course of action, huh?
[00:08:29.746 --> 00:08:30.586]  Total commitment.
[00:08:30.606 --> 00:08:31.087]  Total commitment.
[00:08:31.927 --> 00:08:35.450]  Mandry, do you recall what Clemenceau once said about war?
[00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:39.653]  Uh, no, I didn't think I knew what he was talking about.
[00:08:39.713 --> 00:08:42.374]  He said war was too important to be left to the generals.
[00:08:43.255 --> 00:08:47.418]  When he said that, 50 years ago, he might have been right.
[00:08:48.238 --> 00:08:48.719]  But today,
[00:08:50.111 --> 00:08:52.192]  War is too important to be left to politicians.
[00:08:53.253 --> 00:08:59.516]  They have neither the time, the training, nor the inclination for strategic thought.
[00:09:01.217 --> 00:09:04.758]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:09:05.319 --> 00:09:07.160]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.682]  We're doing something a little different here today.
[00:09:12.262 --> 00:09:14.663]  It is the first day of 2015.
[00:09:14.703 --> 00:09:15.144]  We made it.
[00:09:15.624 --> 00:09:16.364]  Can you believe it?
[00:09:16.424 --> 00:09:17.465]  By the grace of God.
[00:09:18.547 --> 00:09:20.048]  This is going to be an amazing year.
[00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:23.612]  The good, the bad, and the ugly will all show its ugly head.
[00:09:23.632 --> 00:09:32.360]  This is a really old interview from a long time ago, from back in 2001, and the audio quality's not that good.
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:39.386]  But it's Charlton Heston from the archives, then David DeRothschild on the hot seat, and more coming up today.
[00:09:39.406 --> 00:09:41.648]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and fullwars.com.
[00:09:46.694 --> 00:09:47.675]  I don't say that lightly.
[00:09:47.715 --> 00:10:03.127]  I mean, everybody knows who Charlton Heston is, and it really made the socialist, um, in-the-culture war, as Mr. Heston calls it, angry when he stepped up at the plate a couple years ago, back into the Second Amendment fight, and now his new book is amazing, The Courage to be Free.
[00:10:03.607 --> 00:10:11.133]  Why did you decide to get back, uh, really involved in the Second Amendment fight at the forefront, and to, uh, write this new book, The Courage to be Free?
[00:10:11.633 --> 00:10:14.295]  Well, of course I've been involved with the Second Amendment.
[00:10:14.335 --> 00:10:18.118]  You could say since I was a little kid shooting a deer up in Michigan.
[00:10:19.079 --> 00:10:25.704]  But then I became involved more seriously with the Bill of Rights.
[00:10:26.404 --> 00:10:35.952]  And I came to see the importance of defending every one of the twelve articles of the Bill of Rights, of which the second is the right to keep and bear arms.
[00:10:36.332 --> 00:10:40.335]  And we had a lot of success with it in the last election.
[00:10:41.477 --> 00:10:54.946]  Well, we see the mainstream media, the controlled propaganda arms is what I call them, and I think they've shown themselves to deserve that title, convincing a lot of people that the average American isn't for the Second Amendment.
[00:10:54.986 --> 00:11:08.374]  But if you can explain to people the basics of how it's there to defend us from the street thug, the government thug, or to put food on the table, not to mention just as a sporting enjoyment and heritage, most people are actually for it.
[00:11:09.575 --> 00:11:12.057]  John Ashcroft right now, they're trying to confirm him.
[00:11:12.077 --> 00:11:16.541]  I think he would be a good... I think he will be confirmed.
[00:11:16.561 --> 00:11:19.804]  I think he will make a fine Attorney General.
[00:11:19.864 --> 00:11:22.166]  Certainly a far better one than John Abrino.
[00:11:22.526 --> 00:11:25.548]  But absolutely, that wouldn't be too hard to do.
[00:11:25.668 --> 00:11:34.816]  But Mr. Kennedy, who I really don't think has any room to talk, with all the skeletons in his closet, began to attack... There's no one in the U.S.
[00:11:34.876 --> 00:11:35.716]  Senate that has more...
[00:11:36.597 --> 00:11:39.582]  More skeletons in his closet than Kennedy.
[00:11:39.822 --> 00:11:41.244]  He should be ashamed of himself.
[00:11:41.304 --> 00:11:42.025]  He really should.
[00:11:42.145 --> 00:11:44.349]  I worked for his older brother.
[00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.372]  I voted for him.
[00:11:46.692 --> 00:11:47.834]  I campaigned for him.
[00:11:49.356 --> 00:11:52.400]  But Teddy Kennedy is another piece of work entirely.
[00:11:54.446 --> 00:12:18.206]  But anyway, to return to the question of the Second Amendment, there are, for example, now 41 states that have concealed carry laws, meaning that if you pass a background check, show that you have no felony convictions of any kind, show that you demonstrate that you know how to use a firearm safely,
[00:12:19.106 --> 00:12:26.129]  You can then get a permit to carry a concealed carry weapon under your arm or wherever.
[00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.511]  And that's something I don't want to do because I don't fear it.
[00:12:29.871 --> 00:12:33.473]  I've used too many pistols in too many movies.
[00:12:33.513 --> 00:12:34.833]  They're kind of heavy to carry.
[00:12:34.873 --> 00:12:44.018]  But anyway, the point is that in every one of the 42 states where there is concealed carry laws, one
[00:12:44.978 --> 00:12:48.641]  The murder rate, the crime rate, too.
[00:12:49.162 --> 00:12:50.242]  Never mind the murder rate.
[00:12:50.282 --> 00:12:53.385]  The crime rate has dropped significantly.
[00:12:53.945 --> 00:12:56.247]  Significantly in every one of those states.
[00:12:56.828 --> 00:12:57.268]  Why?
[00:12:58.089 --> 00:13:02.672]  Because, of course, most people who have this permit don't carry all the time.
[00:13:03.373 --> 00:13:06.756]  But the point is, the bad guys don't know who's carrying and who isn't.
[00:13:07.616 --> 00:13:11.159]  So that is, of course, you don't need to have to carry them.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:22.168]  You know, I have to say, much as I admired his big brother, I think Teddy Kennedy is one of the worst members of the U.S.
[00:13:22.208 --> 00:13:22.548]  Senate.
[00:13:23.809 --> 00:13:26.352]  I really feel that.
[00:13:27.653 --> 00:13:30.295]  He shoots his mouth off and he has the right to do so.
[00:13:30.315 --> 00:13:30.875]  He's a U.S.
[00:13:30.895 --> 00:13:31.356]  Senator.
[00:13:31.876 --> 00:13:32.937]  But he is not a good one.
[00:13:34.179 --> 00:13:37.120]  Well, I think they show their hatred for the Second Amendment.
[00:13:37.381 --> 00:13:42.463]  You talk about a culture war a lot in your newest book, and of course, in your eloquent speeches.
[00:13:42.483 --> 00:13:50.107]  I almost fell over when I saw you on one of the NRA news shows when you said, you can take it from my cold, dead hand.
[00:13:50.127 --> 00:13:52.048]  You raised up that musket.
[00:13:52.068 --> 00:13:53.108]  The old musket, yeah.
[00:13:55.489 --> 00:13:56.650]  That worked out very well.
[00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.872]  But I think, you know, I can give you any number of examples.
[00:14:01.932 --> 00:14:11.214]  For example, do you know the largest and fastest growing group of purchasers of small handguns in the country?
[00:14:12.095 --> 00:14:12.755]  Single women.
[00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:14.321]  Of course.
[00:14:14.822 --> 00:14:19.824]  They're women with permanently absent husbands who have two or three kids.
[00:14:20.264 --> 00:14:30.289]  They're trying to support, they want to spend some time with them, so that means they have to be there when they're home from school, which means they have to work, make a living, because their husband's long gone.
[00:14:31.628 --> 00:14:41.031]  Uh, by cleaning office buildings till three, four o'clock in the morning and then they ride the bus within three or four blocks of where they live.
[00:14:41.551 --> 00:14:46.452]  But then they gotta walk those last blocks in the dark all by themselves.
[00:14:46.612 --> 00:14:49.033]  Of course they want a small pistol in their pocket.
[00:14:51.809 --> 00:14:58.494]  And how dare this corrupt government, those running it, especially the Democrats, tell women they don't have that right?
[00:14:58.514 --> 00:15:04.618]  I'm sure you've heard that the Solicitor General has said that the Second Amendment, Mr. Heston, does not extend to individuals.
[00:15:04.878 --> 00:15:07.520]  Yeah, I've read that, but of course that's not true.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:13.844]  Every one of the founding fathers, those wise old dead white guys that invented the country,
[00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:24.020]  Every one of them is elaborately on record at the time about the importance of the Second Amendment and the meaning of the Second Amendment.
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.342]  It is simply impossible to deny that.
[00:15:27.623 --> 00:15:35.030]  And the efforts of the anti-gun mob are just specious.
[00:15:36.204 --> 00:15:39.048]  You're talking about the Federalist Papers documenting the Troop Attack?
[00:15:39.068 --> 00:15:39.609]  Yes, of course.
[00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:47.560]  And the Bill of Rights itself, and the Federalist Papers, but also while they were drafting the Bill of Rights, they, uh...
[00:15:50.257 --> 00:15:55.020]  They went, they wrote, every one of them wrote papers on this.
[00:15:56.321 --> 00:15:58.443]  As you said, one of the Federalist Papers.
[00:16:20.137 --> 00:16:20.477]  I think?
[00:16:41.563 --> 00:16:46.244]  Two of those men, both Hitler and Mussolini, were elected by democratic procedure.
[00:16:47.425 --> 00:16:54.366]  And then we get to Pol Pot and Laurent Kabila, who was killed just the day before yesterday, I believe.
[00:16:54.386 --> 00:16:56.427]  I thank God we're not missing.
[00:16:57.547 --> 00:17:03.469]  And Marzi Tung, and, of course, Fidel Castro.
[00:17:08.766 --> 00:17:19.334]  Every one of them, their first act on taking office, including the two that were elected democratically, their first thing they did was to confiscate all privately held firearms.
[00:17:19.374 --> 00:17:22.437]  Their defense rests.
[00:17:23.117 --> 00:17:24.498]  Absolutely, Mr. Heston.
[00:17:24.518 --> 00:17:26.140]  Again, Charlton Heston, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:36.148]  In fact, I've looked at the actual numbers, and accountants and others have, and the states with the highest taxes have the most egregious gun control.
[00:17:36.208 --> 00:17:37.709]  I don't think that's an accident.
[00:17:38.249 --> 00:17:39.490]  No, I don't think so either.
[00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:43.134]  It's the firm intent of the liberal left, no question.
[00:17:43.574 --> 00:17:47.017]  Well, how can they even get away with the term liberal meaning they're into freedom?
[00:17:47.538 --> 00:17:53.063]  I see the so-called liberal left militarizing the police, building prisons everywhere, and going after
[00:17:53.544 --> 00:18:02.874]  Well, of course, originally, the idea of being a liberal meant a certain concern for the rights of the individual.
[00:18:02.894 --> 00:18:04.736]  Now it doesn't mean anything like that.
[00:18:04.857 --> 00:18:06.679]  Now it means the rights of the government.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.563]  And we have to constantly stand against that.
[00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:21.149]  We really had a problem coming after you because on the subject of the God-given rights of black people in this country, you were right out there at the forefront fighting.
[00:18:21.509 --> 00:18:24.731]  When there were real environmental problems, you were out there at the forefront fighting.
[00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:27.332]  And now they're like, what is Heston doing?
[00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:29.033]  He's out there fighting for the Second Amendment.
[00:18:29.073 --> 00:18:29.713]  How dare him?
[00:18:29.753 --> 00:18:38.758]  I actually saw some guys on one of the big classic movie shows bad-mouthing you before they aired Soylent Green, which is one of my favorites.
[00:18:38.778 --> 00:18:39.298]  There you go.
[00:18:39.978 --> 00:18:59.514]  But I have to tell you, the other day on Martin Luther King Day, I was invited by CORE to attend their banquet and I was the principal speaker and they gave me a bust of Dr. King, which having spent as much time as I was able to do with him, I'm very proud to have.
[00:19:00.735 --> 00:19:02.997]  So it's really hard for them to attack your record.
[00:19:03.017 --> 00:19:06.360]  I mean, this really is another human right to be able to defend ourselves.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.441]  Absolutely.
[00:19:12.828 --> 00:19:16.889]  Last question, where do you see the fight in the next two years?
[00:19:16.949 --> 00:19:22.571]  I think it's critical if the Socialists, known as the Democrats, win control of the House and the Senate.
[00:19:22.611 --> 00:19:28.253]  We could even, in four years, have the first gentleman, Bill, back in the White House with Hillary as the President.
[00:19:29.393 --> 00:19:31.874]  No, we couldn't get Mr. Clinton back.
[00:19:33.074 --> 00:19:35.555]  That would be against the Constitution.
[00:19:35.595 --> 00:19:39.456]  Yeah, 22nd Amendment, but he'll still be back in the White House as the first gentleman.
[00:19:39.496 --> 00:19:39.996]  See the joke?
[00:19:40.695 --> 00:19:41.075]  Yeah.
[00:19:41.135 --> 00:19:43.736]  Do you think Mrs. Clinton can be elected?
[00:19:44.276 --> 00:19:44.956]  I don't think so.
[00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:47.116]  I'm not sure.
[00:19:47.136 --> 00:19:50.097]  Well, we're going to have to work on that, aren't we?
[00:19:50.277 --> 00:19:53.558]  I'm glad to see the NRA getting more hardcore.
[00:19:53.618 --> 00:19:54.358]  We've got to do it.
[00:19:54.438 --> 00:19:55.298]  It's too important.
[00:19:56.118 --> 00:20:03.019]  We've tried to keep out of that fight, but I think this last election proved that it was important to stay with it.
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.960]  Every American should vote.
[00:20:15.022 --> 00:20:18.828]  And we are joined by David Mayer de Rothschild.
[00:20:18.848 --> 00:20:23.997]  Al Gore, of course, is kicking off a string of global concerts this weekend on 777.
[00:20:26.876 --> 00:20:49.683]  And the man who's written the official book that is the accompaniment to this, meant for elementary grade school children, is David Mayer de Rothschild, born in 1978, a British adventurer, I love that title, an environmentalist who is the head of Adventure Ecology, an expedition group raising awareness about climate change,
[00:20:50.203 --> 00:20:57.167]  He is the youngest of the three children of Sir Evelyn de Rothschild of the Rothschild Banking Family of England.
[00:20:57.968 --> 00:21:03.691]  One of the arrows shooting out across the planet, invigorating everything.
[00:21:04.872 --> 00:21:07.113]  Mr. Rothschild, thank you for coming on the show with us today.
[00:21:07.713 --> 00:21:08.854]  Thank you for having me on the show.
[00:21:10.315 --> 00:21:11.656]  That's quite an introduction there.
[00:21:11.716 --> 00:21:12.616]  Thank you.
[00:21:12.636 --> 00:21:13.177]  You bet.
[00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:15.938]  Now, I've got a new poll out here.
[00:21:18.004 --> 00:21:25.132]  A Mori poll shows that most people in the UK remain unconvinced about warnings that our climate is being affected by global warming.
[00:21:25.933 --> 00:21:33.642]  What is the science proving that man-made global warming A is real and B will cause cataclysmic problems?
[00:21:34.843 --> 00:21:43.808]  I think the report you really need to be looking at was a report that was released at the beginning of the year by the IPCC, which is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
[00:21:44.208 --> 00:21:49.512]  It's made up of two and a half thousand scientists from around the world, all in the field of climatic studies.
[00:21:49.532 --> 00:21:51.513]  These are the brains, basically.
[00:21:51.533 --> 00:21:54.675]  These are the guys who have been looking at this stuff for a very long time.
[00:21:54.695 --> 00:21:58.998]  You know, they come together, they put this report together, and there was a unanimous
[00:21:59.979 --> 00:22:03.543]  No, no, no.
[00:22:03.563 --> 00:22:16.898]  Mr. Rothschild, a whole bunch of people, hundreds of them have gone public saying that they were included and asked their opinion in research but that many of them never said that they agreed with man-made global warming or its causative effects.
[00:22:18.939 --> 00:22:21.681]  I think that if you read the report, they actually do.
[00:22:21.741 --> 00:22:26.205]  They come out and they say... No, they say their names were added falsely to that report.
[00:22:26.245 --> 00:22:28.486]  Are you aware of that global controversy?
[00:22:28.526 --> 00:22:29.707]  It's been in hundreds of newspapers.
[00:22:30.508 --> 00:22:38.493]  I think the fact of the matter is that this type of argument about whether global warming exists or not, it's just a waste of time.
[00:22:41.235 --> 00:22:49.766]  Now, we all know last year that the media got caught, and National Geographic, the known propaganda channel got caught, showing images of polar bears saying, look at them, they're stranded on ice.
[00:22:50.107 --> 00:22:52.069]  All of Earth's species are threatened.
[00:22:53.811 --> 00:22:55.554]  Some may disappear forever.
[00:22:57.689 --> 00:22:59.331]  Polar bears can swim 200 miles.
[00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:05.737]  You and I both know that, but you know the dumb public that the globalists are always hoodwinking doesn't know that.
[00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:11.722]  And you've got new IMAX programs and new Disney programs coming up going, look at the drowning polar bears.
[00:23:11.943 --> 00:23:13.985]  They're all dying because the ice is melting.
[00:23:14.225 --> 00:23:18.429]  Everyone knows that the glaciers expand and contract and are collapsing continually.
[00:23:20.641 --> 00:23:21.602]  Go ahead, there's your answer.
[00:23:51.602 --> 00:23:53.262]  Do you think I make any money out of this?
[00:23:53.282 --> 00:24:06.929]  And of course I should bring up to Mr. Rothschild that the polar ice caps of Mars are receding at several miles a year, much faster than ours, and that the moons of Saturn and Jupiter are melting.
[00:24:07.009 --> 00:24:10.891]  In fact, several of their moons were ice and are now liquid seas.
[00:24:11.811 --> 00:24:15.753]  Now, how are SUVs causing that, David Rothschild?
[00:24:16.294 --> 00:24:18.415]  That's because those planets are closer to the sun, my friend.
[00:24:19.774 --> 00:24:23.897]  No, Jupiter and Saturn are not closer to the Sun, neither is Mars.
[00:24:24.578 --> 00:24:33.404]  Yes, I think you'll find, right, that the very simple matter, and what I wanted to say, and this is my final point, and then I'll let you continue with your line that global warming doesn't exist.
[00:24:33.724 --> 00:24:41.309]  I find it very sad that we're still in a day and age where there is a certain mentality, or a certain sector that wants to deny that these things are happening.
[00:24:41.649 --> 00:24:45.592]  And you say, you know, you say you don't believe that human beings are responsible for climate change.
[00:24:45.612 --> 00:24:48.594]  That's fine, and I respect your opinion, I respect your views,
[00:24:49.014 --> 00:24:55.938]  I think, though, that you have to realize, if you look at the science, forget your taxation theory, because actually it's not taxation.
[00:24:55.978 --> 00:25:11.728]  What it's trying to do, the taxation bit, is sitting there as one tiny fragment of saying that the polluters of our planet, the companies that are excessively polluting, the only way that they will respond and listen is if they're incentivized through a tax scheme to stop them polluting.
[00:25:11.988 --> 00:25:13.529]  And that tax scheme isn't in your pocket.
[00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:22.192]  That is the companies, the exons of this world, the companies that are going out there and needlessly polluting our water systems, our natural systems.
[00:25:22.472 --> 00:25:28.954]  I think it's sad, sir, that you can, you know, I appreciate and respect people's views on both sides of the argument.
[00:25:28.994 --> 00:25:30.314]  That's what a debate is about.
[00:25:30.374 --> 00:25:33.695]  And I appreciate your views in taking this debate to me.
[00:25:34.075 --> 00:25:38.577]  But I would also say that it's sad because what you're doing here is giving people a false sense of hope.
[00:25:39.057 --> 00:25:41.399]  Our planet is in a seriously bad way right now.
[00:25:41.839 --> 00:25:53.966]  And if we continue to put out this rhetoric which says this doesn't exist, which you are doing and you're promoting, then all it's going to do is delay the situation that is going to cause more problems for your children, for my children, and the future of this planet.
[00:25:54.186 --> 00:25:55.887]  You're saying we need to have a stable climate.
[00:25:56.107 --> 00:25:58.649]  Sir, the planet's never had a stable climate.
[00:25:58.929 --> 00:25:59.709]  The planet hasn't.
[00:25:59.829 --> 00:26:02.411]  For the last 12,000 years, we've been in a very
[00:26:03.363 --> 00:26:06.804]  Very stable, comparatively, for the four and a half billion years the planet's been around.
[00:26:07.504 --> 00:26:11.005]  A period of climatic systems, our systems are being incredibly stable.
[00:26:11.225 --> 00:26:14.406]  And I agree with you, we need carbon as a driver of life, I'm not denying that.
[00:26:14.426 --> 00:26:19.268]  You know, we have huge pockets of reserves of carbon, which are under, which from
[00:26:19.488 --> 00:26:19.929]  We're good.
[00:26:35.931 --> 00:26:46.139]  So we're confusing two things when we're pumping out, not only pumping out excess carbon, more than the natural system, but we're slashing burn agriculture, we're cutting down our carbon sinks, to balance that.
[00:26:46.459 --> 00:26:52.504]  Our oceans are incredibly precarious, they absorb 40% of our world's atmospheric carbon.
[00:26:52.524 --> 00:26:54.065]  Oh, I agree with it, I agree with it.
[00:26:54.125 --> 00:26:55.506]  And our temperatures get warmer.
[00:26:55.726 --> 00:27:04.888]  Let me just say this, but you're tying together plankton blooms and different differentials in with carbon dioxide itself.
[00:27:04.968 --> 00:27:16.910]  And is it the different, and it's not just one tax, I mean, they're now tying the different environmental movements that, oh, we need a tax on more than one child, which really is a one-child policy.
[00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:21.831]  So we already see this whole move to restrict carbon really a tax on life, a tax on breathing.
[00:27:22.788 --> 00:27:24.910]  I don't think it's attacks on life and attacks on breathing.
[00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.332]  I think the fact of the matter is, we have one planet.
[00:27:27.512 --> 00:27:28.513]  We don't have a spare one.
[00:27:29.034 --> 00:27:38.482]  We know that our system can, you know, whatever you want to call it, whether you want to call it a cyclical change, whether you want to call it global warming, you know, everyone has their own opinion.
[00:27:38.983 --> 00:27:43.106]  And I think the fact of the matter is, for me personally, the time for debate is over.
[00:27:43.126 --> 00:27:46.990]  This is no longer about does it exist, does it not exist, who's doing what, who's not.
[00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:58.420]  As we keep on talking, the planet, the very thing that supports us... So we need to just stop thinking and just agree it's happening and go do whatever Al Gore says and just world government will save us.
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.982]  Well, okay, in a perfect world, what should we do, Rothschild?
[00:28:02.863 --> 00:28:05.266]  In the perfect world... What should we do to save ourselves?
[00:28:05.286 --> 00:28:05.586]  Tell me.
[00:28:05.706 --> 00:28:06.427]  Save me.
[00:28:06.607 --> 00:28:07.368]  Save me.
[00:28:07.728 --> 00:28:08.349]  I'm saving you.
[00:28:08.449 --> 00:28:15.816]  In the perfect world, sir, you start to use common sense, which is obviously something that, you know, from some of your comments, I'm afraid I don't see.
[00:28:15.976 --> 00:28:16.456]  Save me.
[00:28:16.636 --> 00:28:17.157]  Oh, God.
[00:28:17.177 --> 00:28:18.838]  Will you save me, young ladies?
[00:28:19.219 --> 00:28:20.680]  Oh, Lord Rothschild, save me!
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.243]  You're such a dashing adventurer, like Indiana Jones!
[00:28:24.524 --> 00:28:25.625]  Oh, Lord Rothschild!
[00:28:25.965 --> 00:28:27.687]  Take me, Lord Rothschild!
[00:28:27.727 --> 00:28:35.375]  You sound like... You sound like... Listen, Mr. Oil Baron sitting in the South... If you want to start making funny noises like that on the phone, that's fair enough, oil boy.
[00:28:35.655 --> 00:28:43.864]  So get back onto your little rodeo ball, go out there and deny it all, protect your oil shares and make sure that your kids, who you talked about, don't have any planet to live on.
[00:28:45.706 --> 00:28:48.567]  Well, there's always, you know, hold on, I've read quite a few history books.
[00:28:49.687 --> 00:28:59.149]  You know, even back at the time of Waterloo, when your family was so active, we've got all sorts of fires and storms and floods and things going on.
[00:28:59.169 --> 00:29:10.792]  I mean, witch doctors 5,000 years ago would point at an eclipse or point at a wildfire or point at a snowstorm and say, you better bring better offerings to my tent or I'll make the ooga boogas get you.
[00:29:11.392 --> 00:29:21.975]  I mean, really, isn't this just a organizing system to bring in global taxation and regulations this whole... I mean, what is your solution to the global warming?
[00:29:22.035 --> 00:29:23.736]  Is it not the global... Hold on.
[00:29:23.776 --> 00:29:26.336]  Is it not the global carbon tax, as Al Gore's called for?
[00:29:26.356 --> 00:29:28.437]  It's... There's many things.
[00:29:28.537 --> 00:29:34.398]  I think what you have to realize is that being environmentally sensitive and making money aren't mutually exclusive.
[00:29:34.458 --> 00:29:38.079]  There's a lot of money to be made in addressing this issue.
[00:29:44.056 --> 00:29:55.843]  Coming up after the break, the host of UFC, you name it, TV shows, movies, a good friend of mine, definitely a free thinker, Joe Rogan, and then of course also Viggo Mortensen needs no introduction.
[00:29:56.223 --> 00:29:57.664]  All this and more straight ahead.
[00:29:58.004 --> 00:29:58.825]  It's January 4th.
[00:29:59.245 --> 00:30:02.247]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.167 --> 00:30:05.849]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:40.238 --> 00:30:44.259]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[00:30:44.559 --> 00:30:53.743]  And Secret 12 is a fusion of two organic proprietary forms of Vitamin B12, bringing you a true nutraceutical quality Vitamin B12.

[00:31:09.988 --> 00:31:12.549]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:13.810]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:15.550]  Even with diet and exercise.
[00:31:15.771 --> 00:31:20.792]  Because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[00:31:20.952 --> 00:31:27.775]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[00:31:28.095 --> 00:31:30.078]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.
[00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:36.809]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[00:31:37.169 --> 00:31:43.079]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining three essential formulations.

[00:32:09.864 --> 00:32:13.365]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:32:13.525 --> 00:32:17.486]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:32:17.806 --> 00:32:19.266]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:32:19.586 --> 00:32:27.168]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[00:32:51.283 --> 00:32:56.307]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:33:18.689 --> 00:33:27.634]  It was about six and a half years ago, Obama was president-elect, and I sat in here in this very green room at Cap City Comedy Club, Joe.
[00:33:27.974 --> 00:33:29.895]  That video's been seen about 40 million times now.
[00:33:29.915 --> 00:33:31.015]  That's ridiculous.
[00:33:31.076 --> 00:33:31.536]  Literally.
[00:33:32.076 --> 00:33:34.097]  Like 14 million on just one spot on YouTube.
[00:33:34.217 --> 00:33:34.878]  That's ridiculous.
[00:33:35.358 --> 00:33:42.842]  You, early on, when everybody else was saying Obama was the savior, you were saying, why does anybody expect him to be any different?
[00:33:44.182 --> 00:33:47.164]  And it was like right when he was president-elect, or right when he got out of office,
[00:33:47.324 --> 00:33:54.348]  It's pretty obvious that there's some gigantic financial institutions that have been pulling the strings of politicians in this country for a long time.
[00:33:54.708 --> 00:34:01.492]  And just the fact that we have it set up where they can donate millions of dollars to these guys' funds, these guys' campaigns.
[00:34:01.833 --> 00:34:04.614]  I mean, how do we not expect it all to go bad?
[00:34:05.075 --> 00:34:07.556]  They put so much into him, built him up as his big brand name.
[00:34:07.576 --> 00:34:08.236]  What's your take on that?
[00:34:08.397 --> 00:34:09.197]  Well, you know what, man?
[00:34:09.217 --> 00:34:12.459]  I don't even think Obama is to blame.
[00:34:12.479 --> 00:34:13.039]  I really don't.
[00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:15.421]  I don't think there's an individual that's to blame.
[00:34:16.321 --> 00:34:40.723]  I think that what we're looking at, and I'm obviously no political expert by any means, but as a person who's observing a system, who's a person who's observing this strange society that we live in and how it's influenced by money and corporations and how politicians are beholden to so many different groups before they get into any positions of power.
[00:34:41.543 --> 00:34:43.945]  It's incredibly difficult to change anything.
[00:34:44.465 --> 00:34:51.330]  And it's not like this statement about Obama as President or Obama as a person.
[00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:55.513]  It's more that the system is so intertangled.
[00:34:55.993 --> 00:34:57.274]  It's so intertwined.
[00:34:57.614 --> 00:35:15.652]  With political interest groups and with lobbyists and with corporations having mad control over the political system, over who gets represented, which party, you know, who represents which party, the people that have the most money historically have done the best.
[00:35:16.012 --> 00:35:18.374]  I mean, it's like a big, crazy money grab.
[00:35:18.594 --> 00:35:20.636]  And then these people get into these positions of power and
[00:35:21.637 --> 00:35:22.238]  I don't think
[00:35:51.857 --> 00:35:59.221]  For people to look at the actions of their country and not totally be able to defend some of the stuff that we've done militarily.
[00:35:59.961 --> 00:36:13.208]  When people look at that and they go, there's a lot of people that I know that are patriots, a lot of people that I know that are veterans, that love America, that believe in the military, and they're very upset with the way the direction of these wars has gone.
[00:36:14.088 --> 00:36:18.531]  Very upset with the image that it's given America worldwide.
[00:36:19.171 --> 00:36:20.071]  There's the famous
[00:36:21.906 --> 00:36:31.510]  The point that many people had right after September 11th was this was an incredible time where there was so much sympathy of these other nations.
[00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:33.831]  They were so on the side of America.
[00:36:33.891 --> 00:36:34.852]  America had been attacked.
[00:36:35.032 --> 00:36:35.792]  This is horrible.
[00:36:35.812 --> 00:36:36.812]  The whole world was watching.
[00:36:37.253 --> 00:36:44.956]  And within a period of a few years, our actions were so f***ed up that we lost all that sympathy.
[00:36:44.976 --> 00:36:49.498]  There was this moment where America had this position of love.
[00:36:49.998 --> 00:36:53.821]  You know, where the whole world was like, hey, we're sorry that happened to you.
[00:36:53.841 --> 00:37:07.950]  And by the actions, the mistakes, the push, the pull, whatever it was that led us from September 11, 2001 to where we are in 2014, whatever it is that led us to that, it bums a lot of people out, you know?
[00:37:08.929 --> 00:37:12.713]  Remember like in 1999 I'd be telling you about that stuff and how they were listed and everything?
[00:37:12.774 --> 00:37:17.459]  Dude, you thought that, you thought they were spying on everything way before anybody did.
[00:37:17.779 --> 00:37:18.760]  But I'm not tooting my horn.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.382]  I didn't, I wasn't psychic.
[00:37:20.402 --> 00:37:21.503]  Yeah, but it's not just that.
[00:37:21.523 --> 00:37:22.204]  It was in the documents.
[00:37:22.224 --> 00:37:23.586]  There's also... You have the documents.
[00:37:23.626 --> 00:37:24.567]  You have the documents.
[00:37:25.428 --> 00:37:32.133]  One thing that I always tell everybody, like, the first video that I ever saw that made me go, what?
[00:37:32.393 --> 00:37:33.434]  They do that?
[00:37:33.994 --> 00:37:34.895]  That's real?
[00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:42.301]  Was your 9-1-1 Road to Tyranny documentary where you detailed what happened in the World Trade Organization.
[00:37:42.722 --> 00:37:42.962]  Oh yeah.
[00:37:43.502 --> 00:37:49.947]  The WTO protests, we detailed how they used these guys to come in, these agent provocateurs.
[00:37:50.368 --> 00:37:53.970]  They were, it was a peaceful protest in order to make it non-peaceful.
[00:37:54.231 --> 00:38:03.758]  These guys came in with government-issue boots, ski masks, everything up, smashed things, and then they turn it into like a war zone, so then the cops get to move in and arrest everybody.
[00:38:04.018 --> 00:38:05.880]  They made the whole thing a no-protest zone.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:09.362]  These guys, they would hold up in some house somewhere, right?
[00:38:09.382 --> 00:38:10.843]  Yeah, they got to pay for their house.
[00:38:11.805 --> 00:38:13.368]  And then they negotiated them free.
[00:38:13.709 --> 00:38:14.491]  They got free.
[00:38:14.811 --> 00:38:17.618]  So these guys smashed all these windows.
[00:38:17.678 --> 00:38:19.041]  And they had the Delta Force running them.
[00:38:19.892 --> 00:38:20.452]  That even came out.
[00:38:20.513 --> 00:38:22.014]  I mean, people in Seattle knew about that.
[00:38:22.034 --> 00:38:25.557]  I was being called a conspiracy theorist just because I had the local newspapers from there.
[00:38:25.737 --> 00:38:27.718]  It sounds so crazy.
[00:38:27.979 --> 00:38:29.600]  If someone tells you that, you go, that's crazy.
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:35.705]  But then you find out that is actually a tactic that gets used to break up protests.
[00:38:35.745 --> 00:38:37.666]  McDonald's, they're dumping over garbage cans.
[00:38:38.527 --> 00:38:41.470]  And they are very angry again and hostile.
[00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:46.934]  We're seeing more clashes with other protesters telling them to stop because they're giving everyone a bad name.
[00:38:47.372 --> 00:38:49.972]  That WTO stuff is one of the most telling things I've ever seen.
[00:38:49.992 --> 00:38:51.873]  I was like, wow, that's really what they do.
[00:38:51.893 --> 00:38:52.873]  They really do do that.
[00:38:53.273 --> 00:38:54.873]  But it makes sense.
[00:38:55.434 --> 00:38:56.674]  Alright, alright, getting serious.
[00:38:57.454 --> 00:38:58.114]  Robin Williams.
[00:38:58.694 --> 00:38:59.334]  Oh, that's sad.
[00:39:02.295 --> 00:39:03.035]  It's just sad.
[00:39:03.215 --> 00:39:05.635]  Yeah, it's sad when anybody has depression.
[00:39:05.755 --> 00:39:14.097]  And when a guy who's so beloved doesn't feel it and kills himself, it seems almost... almost impossibly tragic.
[00:39:16.053 --> 00:39:16.474]  I met him.
[00:39:17.576 --> 00:39:23.389]  I met Robin Williams at the Hollywood Improv and I didn't know it was him until I was in the middle of talking to him.
[00:39:24.858 --> 00:39:28.640]  I did a show and there was a line of people after the show that were taking pictures.
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:37.824]  And I was taking pictures of all these people and this guy comes up and he starts telling me, he's just being really complimentary, telling me he loved this one bit that I did about dolphins.
[00:39:38.424 --> 00:39:41.545]  And then I'm looking at him and I'm realizing, holy shit, this is Robin Williams.
[00:39:42.006 --> 00:39:44.126]  Like, I thought I was just talking to some guy.
[00:39:44.146 --> 00:39:50.549]  But in the middle of talking to him, like, this is what he was... There was no pretense, nothing weird about him.
[00:39:50.649 --> 00:39:51.830]  He's a giant movie star.
[00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:54.011]  He waited in line with all the other people.
[00:39:54.731 --> 00:39:57.393]  And he had a hat on and glasses and I didn't know it was him.
[00:39:58.014 --> 00:40:02.878]  I literally didn't know it was him until he was like two minutes into our conversation.
[00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:05.160]  That you are here.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.003]  That life exists and identity.
[00:40:10.584 --> 00:40:14.047]  That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse.
[00:40:14.847 --> 00:40:19.531]  I agree and I disagree with you on your chemtrail show on conspiracies.
[00:40:19.551 --> 00:40:20.152]  That was a good show.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.120]  Are you still doing that show?
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.881]  No, I don't think so.
[00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:28.523]  Well, we're still talking, but if we do do it, it's going to be in a different way.
[00:40:28.783 --> 00:40:42.249]  Because there was a problem with that show, and one of the problems is that most of the subjects were kind of like, you know, you're talking to people about UFOs, you're talking to people about the Bigfoot, you're hoping that you're going to get some real information.
[00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.629]  Oh, yeah.
[00:40:42.849 --> 00:40:47.231]  The reality is when you start digging into how a lot of these folks think,
[00:40:48.314 --> 00:40:52.757]  They have this exorbitant need to believe that those things are true.
[00:40:53.097 --> 00:40:54.738]  Whether it's UFOs or Bigfoot.
[00:40:54.758 --> 00:40:56.979]  There's not a lot of critical thinking.
[00:40:57.199 --> 00:41:01.962]  I agree, but the media only lets you have shows where you cover Bigfoot and Chupacabras.
[00:41:01.982 --> 00:41:03.623]  They often make some shows like that.
[00:41:03.643 --> 00:41:07.985]  I was on Ventura's show for a while and it went to that in the third season so they basically cancelled it.
[00:41:08.225 --> 00:41:09.446]  So I think it's more of a corporate thing.
[00:41:10.106 --> 00:41:10.527]  I agree with you.
[00:41:10.567 --> 00:41:13.831]  A lot of the so-called conspiracy culture is BS stuff on purpose.
[00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:16.374]  And most of the chemtrail stuff is bull.
[00:41:16.434 --> 00:41:17.215]  It's ice crystals.
[00:41:17.515 --> 00:41:21.660]  But there are real government programs to geoengineer and manipulate the weather.
[00:41:21.901 --> 00:41:22.842]  I think you're probably right.
[00:41:23.142 --> 00:41:23.923]  I don't doubt that.
[00:41:24.364 --> 00:41:25.605]  That's not what I doubted at all.
[00:41:26.346 --> 00:41:28.168]  No, I know just what particular people are saying.
[00:41:28.188 --> 00:41:30.950]  This is a real issue when people are looking at Southwest flights.
[00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:37.755]  They're going back and forth over Burbank Airport or any airport and they look at them and they, you know, they think something is going on.
[00:41:37.975 --> 00:41:39.696]  They think that they're getting sprayed.
[00:41:40.177 --> 00:41:42.238]  They think that the government is spraying them.
[00:41:42.258 --> 00:41:44.380]  But the reality... They think the NSA is watching them.
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:45.520]  Here's the thing.
[00:42:04.707 --> 00:42:05.468]  Oh, it's incredible.
[00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:23.351]  It's not good at all.
[00:42:23.411 --> 00:42:25.633]  Like, living near an airport is terrible for the world.
[00:42:25.813 --> 00:42:27.274]  Like, that's the real chemtrail.
[00:42:27.574 --> 00:42:29.356]  The real chemtrail is... Is the fuel.
[00:42:29.536 --> 00:42:31.878]  Yeah, it's not that they're spraying shit in the sky.
[00:42:31.898 --> 00:42:33.319]  A lot of them don't like to land heavy.
[00:42:33.339 --> 00:42:35.140]  The big secret is they start dumping fuels.
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:35.841]  You know that.
[00:42:35.861 --> 00:42:36.021]  Yeah.
[00:42:36.361 --> 00:42:37.462]  I mean, it is crazy.
[00:42:37.682 --> 00:42:38.343]  Well, it's also...
[00:42:39.823 --> 00:42:46.246]  There have been all sorts of theories about geoengineering, about how to accomplish it.
[00:42:46.526 --> 00:42:50.807]  There's been all sorts of discussion about what to do if the hole in the ozone layer gets bigger.
[00:42:51.328 --> 00:42:57.990]  Many, many scientists have come up with what they think are theories or partial solutions or ideas for future concepts.
[00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:01.812]  It could be a solution someday when technology reaches that certain point.
[00:43:01.872 --> 00:43:02.652]  Space layers.
[00:43:03.978 --> 00:43:07.321]  To think that, you know, to think that they have it would be silly, right?
[00:43:07.361 --> 00:43:09.082]  Why wouldn't they think about those things?
[00:43:09.102 --> 00:43:10.823]  Why wouldn't they study those things?
[00:43:16.923 --> 00:43:21.806]  Viggo, of course, Lord of the Rings, Viggo Mortensen, of so many huge films.
[00:43:21.886 --> 00:43:22.866]  I am a giant fan.
[00:43:22.906 --> 00:43:23.987]  My wife is a huge fan.
[00:43:24.367 --> 00:43:25.808]  Everybody I know is a huge fan.
[00:43:26.388 --> 00:43:28.029]  And he joins us.
[00:43:28.349 --> 00:43:35.833]  The NSA, what do you make of the fact that just a few years ago, people would say, oh, it's a conspiracy theory, that they're listening to us.
[00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:38.554]  And now we learn they're targeting political dissidents.
[00:43:39.195 --> 00:43:41.156]  Aaron Swartz was being harassed.
[00:43:41.816 --> 00:43:44.718]  We're learning that they're using the IRS against political groups.
[00:43:45.319 --> 00:43:52.705]  Do you think there's an awakening happening, or do you think that now the system just doesn't care if we know that we're slaves, basically, Viggo?
[00:43:52.945 --> 00:43:58.309]  I think that there is an awakening, because all these things are being talked about right now, today.
[00:43:59.049 --> 00:44:03.733]  But, you know, people have very short attention spans nowadays.
[00:44:03.833 --> 00:44:09.878]  You know, the more gadgets we have, the more phones and apps, and then you started with
[00:44:11.335 --> 00:44:15.759]  The onslaught of cable, TV, way back when, and then the internet.
[00:44:15.819 --> 00:44:21.043]  And the more access we have, you would think the more informed we're going to be and the more connected we're going to be with each other.
[00:44:21.583 --> 00:44:25.746]  But people tend to go to the information that supports what they already believe.
[00:44:25.846 --> 00:44:26.126]  Yes.
[00:44:26.166 --> 00:44:26.467]  You know?
[00:44:26.927 --> 00:44:33.012]  And so people seem to get more disunited and more united, unfortunately.
[00:44:33.312 --> 00:44:39.376]  And when I say short attention span, yeah, the whole stuff about the NSA, or about the IRS,
[00:44:41.069 --> 00:44:42.249]  Uh, about the drone strikes.
[00:44:42.289 --> 00:44:44.370]  I mean, how much are they talking about drone strikes right now?
[00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:49.571]  Not really at all, but like another fad that just went away in the news cycle.
[00:44:49.731 --> 00:44:57.573]  And I think it's, the problem is, and I think the politicians count on it, is that people can be, uh, you know, swayed.
[00:44:57.593 --> 00:44:59.433]  It's like, here's a piece of cheese.
[00:44:59.513 --> 00:45:01.354]  Follow this piece of cheese.
[00:45:01.374 --> 00:45:04.455]  Go over there and take this left while I take care of this other business.
[00:45:05.095 --> 00:45:09.916]  The problem with Obama, and I support a lot of things about him, I think he's a very intelligent man.
[00:45:10.692 --> 00:45:12.254]  I supported him both times.
[00:45:12.434 --> 00:45:14.776]  There wasn't much of another option, obviously.
[00:45:15.277 --> 00:45:28.731]  But the thing is that the people he appointed, right, that started since the beginning was in 2008, I think we announced that we're going to be part of fixing the, you know, economic disaster that Bush left.
[00:45:29.571 --> 00:45:32.374]  We're the same people that caused the problem on Wall Street, for example.
[00:45:32.615 --> 00:45:33.836]  So I didn't expect much there.
[00:45:34.651 --> 00:45:44.978]  His behavior in foreign policy, whether it be Iraq, Guantanamo, Afghanistan, you know, people still think that Afghanistan is a good war.
[00:45:45.498 --> 00:45:47.920]  It's not any more of a good war than Iraq was.
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:54.464]  It's not any more of a sensible use of our resources and our, you know, young people's lives.
[00:45:55.610 --> 00:46:04.895]  Sure, well what about Obama getting a Peace Prize, and then now putting Al-Qaeda in Syria?
[00:46:05.556 --> 00:46:06.236]  That's ridiculous.
[00:46:06.616 --> 00:46:18.863]  I mean, unfortunately, Obama's government has not really been much different than Bush's in a lot of areas, and not just in foreign policy.
[00:46:19.083 --> 00:46:21.084]  Foreign policy is the most egregious, you know?
[00:46:21.124 --> 00:46:23.945]  Like, if we go into Syria now to try to
[00:46:25.606 --> 00:46:25.886]  Help.
[00:46:26.727 --> 00:46:27.667]  Get rid of Assad.
[00:46:28.948 --> 00:46:32.109]  People in the Arab world aren't going to say, oh isn't that great the U.S.
[00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:33.070]  is doing something good.
[00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:41.414]  Because the way they have seen the United States, the way they judge the United States is based on how they behaved in the Israel-Palestine situation.
[00:46:41.434 --> 00:46:43.636]  The way they have behaved since 1948.
[00:46:45.136 --> 00:46:49.759]  And every single president, including Obama, has given special treatment to Israel.
[00:46:50.359 --> 00:46:52.080]  And that's obvious to Arab people.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.961]  So it's going to be hard for us
[00:46:54.864 --> 00:47:02.126]  To be considered the good guy, which is something that our government, and I think our people, we all want people to like us and think, oh, we're the good guys.
[00:47:02.166 --> 00:47:03.626]  We're the guys from World War II.
[00:47:04.026 --> 00:47:08.248]  They handed out candy bars on the streets of Paris and Rome.
[00:47:08.728 --> 00:47:10.548]  You know, we're the guys with the Marshall Plan.
[00:47:10.888 --> 00:47:13.249]  People don't see us that way, unfortunately.
[00:47:13.609 --> 00:47:14.889]  They see us as the bullies.
[00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:16.390]  It's not these Americans.
[00:47:17.899 --> 00:47:20.782]  Any nicer or less nice than other people in the world.
[00:47:20.822 --> 00:47:21.502]  We're just people.
[00:47:21.842 --> 00:47:26.847]  But our government, which represents us, has not been a good player.
[00:47:27.634 --> 00:47:29.895]  Very rarely has been a good player overseas.
[00:47:30.336 --> 00:47:32.737]  Viggo Mortensen is our guest.
[00:47:33.037 --> 00:47:39.981]  Going back to the NSA here, Peter King, Dick Cheney, others have called for his arrest.
[00:47:40.341 --> 00:47:43.983]  There's been news in the Daily Mail where they're talking about killing him.
[00:47:44.464 --> 00:47:49.166]  I think that Snowden is a hero leaking the NSA info.
[00:47:49.767 --> 00:47:53.389]  Viggo Mortensen, what would you like to say on that subject?
[00:47:54.597 --> 00:47:57.278]  I think he's definitely a very brave person.
[00:47:57.298 --> 00:48:08.081]  I also think it's ironic that all the Bush team, you know, attack Obama, and for instance Obama, for doing exactly the same thing they were doing.
[00:48:08.301 --> 00:48:13.682]  You know, I mean, it's pretty hypocritical, that behavior.
[00:48:14.023 --> 00:48:15.383]  I want to, I know this seems like
[00:48:24.054 --> 00:48:38.322]  The road touched me like no other film I've ever seen and because I've studied history and things and had some experiences it's so real and I know within 10 days most people become cannibals in Pentagon Studies.
[00:48:39.262 --> 00:48:43.625]  In closing, that's a film that I am physically afraid
[00:48:46.311 --> 00:48:46.691]  Well, it's true.
[00:48:46.731 --> 00:48:50.013]  It's a harrowing experience to watch it, but it's also beautifully made.
[00:48:50.033 --> 00:48:50.573]  Oh, it is.
[00:48:50.593 --> 00:48:53.995]  And John Hale directed that movie, and John did a great job with a tough subject matter.
[00:48:54.015 --> 00:48:56.456]  And the boy in it, Cody Smigny, who's now
[00:49:14.176 --> 00:49:15.377]  He's over six feet tall.
[00:49:15.437 --> 00:49:16.778]  He's a man now.
[00:49:16.839 --> 00:49:19.561]  But he was fantastic in that movie.
[00:49:19.601 --> 00:49:25.066]  And it's unfortunate that at the last minute they decided not to distribute it as widely as they were going to.
[00:49:25.106 --> 00:49:26.967]  But like I say, good work.
[00:49:27.127 --> 00:49:32.292]  Eventually gets seen and a lot of people on the street, as many people
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:34.121]  I think so.
[00:49:52.267 --> 00:50:00.650]  Robert Duvall, you and your son are there, and he explains that boy's a god in this ugly, destroyed world.
[00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:08.553]  He doesn't say that, but that's what I got in the poetry of it, is that this youth, this energy, the creativity, the green shoots in a dead world.
[00:50:09.834 --> 00:50:11.234]  Children are our future.
[00:50:11.955 --> 00:50:14.916]  And, I mean, what is your takeaway by that writing?
[00:50:15.871 --> 00:50:16.892]  Yeah, it's beautiful.
[00:50:16.992 --> 00:50:24.880]  I mean, I would paraphrase in a way what he was saying, or how I would put it, is that children are God.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:25.861]  Pay attention.
[00:50:26.161 --> 00:50:33.588]  That doesn't mean spoil your kid, or it doesn't mean that you're talking sickly about the kid, but remember what you felt when you were a kid.
[00:50:34.089 --> 00:50:35.891]  Remember your creative instincts.
[00:50:36.011 --> 00:50:37.672]  Remember your instincts for peace.
[00:50:38.413 --> 00:50:40.315]  Remember your instincts for fellowship.
[00:50:41.677 --> 00:50:52.199]  And for making something beautiful out of life, not destroying the world and not destroying the lives of others, you know, as adults often do, unfortunately.
[00:50:52.839 --> 00:50:57.340]  So remember, kid, remember yourself as a kid, and you're going to be on the right track.
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:01.501]  Wow, Viggo Mortensen, you are a beautiful person, and I hope to meet you someday in person.
[00:51:01.781 --> 00:51:05.222]  God bless you for sharing your time with us and for trying to help humanity.

[00:54:13.939 --> 00:54:19.541]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:54:21.362 --> 00:54:28.325]  Infowars.com.
[00:54:28.525 --> 00:54:34.828]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:54:36.529 --> 00:54:38.229]  Incredible.
[00:54:38.269 --> 00:54:39.590]  Show how far you can come.
[00:54:42.057 --> 00:55:07.712]  Back in college, when Beavis & Butthead was airing, I could have never imagined that the guy that created King of the Hill, Idiocracy, X-Track, Office Space, Beavis & Butthead, the list goes on and on, his current hit show, Silicon Valley on HBO, that I would be friends with Mike Judge, and I'd go out and shoot at his ranch with him and hang out and stuff, he's an amazing musician, and that he would be a patriot who was aware of the New World Order.
[00:55:08.761 --> 00:55:14.124]  Or that some of me went into Hank Hill when he was writing that character watching me on AXS Television.
[00:55:14.345 --> 00:55:16.486]  It's one of the most successful TV shows ever.
[00:55:17.426 --> 00:55:21.409]  And brought in more than a billion dollars in syndication alone.
[00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:26.152]  But the issue is, even someone as powerful as Mike Judge
[00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:38.282]  in Hollywood is scared of the system and had the courage to talk about the fact that he didn't want to really criticize the New World Order because they might come after him, but he went ahead in this interview.
[00:55:40.184 --> 00:55:41.586]  The interview with Heston was back in 2001.
[00:55:41.626 --> 00:55:44.329]  David Rothschild was back in 2007.
[00:55:48.387 --> 00:55:50.328]  The interview you heard with Joe Rogan was 2014.
[00:55:50.388 --> 00:55:53.390]  Viggo Mortensen was this year as well.
[00:55:54.110 --> 00:55:57.972]  The interview with Mike Judge was back in May of 2013 at his house.
[00:55:58.552 --> 00:56:02.375]  That is coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:56:02.995 --> 00:56:08.778]  And then we're going to have Rowdy, Rowdy Piper and Sean Stone on a really powerful interview.
[00:56:09.098 --> 00:56:12.240]  We've got excerpts of Willie Nelson and Russell Brand.
[00:56:13.559 --> 00:56:18.283]  And again, Russell Brand said on the air that my show helped kind of change his worldview and wake him up some.
[00:56:19.003 --> 00:56:29.391]  Doesn't mean Russell Brand and I agree on everything, but he's an interesting guy that wants to empower humanity, and we've interviewed him here in Austin for the TV show and gone out and interviewed him, but also via the phone.
[00:56:30.973 --> 00:56:51.959]  And so we've got some excerpts of that coming up, and when you talk to a Willie Nelson, who I got to be friends with, he lives here in Austin, or a Rowdy Rowdy Piper, or a Sean Stone, or a Mike Judge, or Joe Rogan, or a Viggo Mortensen, or a Charlton Heston, there's only one person here that doesn't like us, that's David Rothschild, who says polar bears can't swim, basically, and says that the
[00:56:53.436 --> 00:56:56.358]  Says that Mars is closer to the Sun than the Earth.
[00:56:57.379 --> 00:56:59.480]  And he just called me a conspiracy theorist, so it must be true.
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:02.883]  It doesn't matter that it's Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and then so on.
[00:57:03.703 --> 00:57:07.966]  Because he is the heir of the Rothschild fortune, and what he says goes.
[00:57:08.206 --> 00:57:14.090]  And if he's got a children's book with, you know, grounding penguins or polar bears on the cover, then it's okay.
[00:57:15.371 --> 00:57:20.415]  But I just want to point out that it's safe for him to run around and say that, because nobody's trying to shut down his free speech.
[00:57:21.488 --> 00:57:25.154]  So many times when I criticize one of these globalists, they say, oh, you're attacking my free speech.
[00:57:25.214 --> 00:57:27.338]  No, that would be if I tried to shut you up.
[00:57:27.939 --> 00:57:29.802]  Disagreeing with you is my free speech.
[00:57:30.623 --> 00:57:31.985]  But I appreciate Mike Judge.
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:39.164]  Having the courage to talk to us, and he says this is one of his favorite interviews he's ever done, so that is coming up.
[00:57:39.725 --> 00:57:50.212]  Before we go to break here, we do not take money from you at gunpoint like the IRS or the Federal Reserve, and we don't give it to NPR and stimulus money or to MSNBC.
[00:57:50.232 --> 00:57:53.835]  We are funded by you liking the high-quality products that are made in America.
[00:57:54.195 --> 00:57:58.518]  Pay trade apparel to meet like-minded friends and fund the operation at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:59.719 --> 00:58:00.019]  I think so.
[00:58:20.319 --> 00:58:23.642]  But we're offering it at 48% off for the next two weeks.
[00:58:23.662 --> 00:58:28.246]  So do the challenge with me, because I'm going to really focus and take the products every day.
[00:58:28.306 --> 00:58:29.687]  Something I forget to do.
[00:58:29.707 --> 00:58:32.070]  I've had a great response to it every other day or so.
[00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:33.911]  What will the response be in the next month?
[00:58:34.131 --> 00:58:35.873]  We're going to photograph and videotape all of it.
[00:58:36.353 --> 00:58:38.235]  Do it with us and it supports the broadcast.
[00:58:38.575 --> 00:58:40.757]  This could make this year really different.
[00:58:40.777 --> 00:58:40.757]  2015.

[00:59:01.071 --> 00:59:02.112]  In the near future.
[00:59:02.392 --> 00:59:06.556]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:59:06.896 --> 00:59:07.917]  Security alert.
[00:59:08.137 --> 00:59:09.859]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:59:10.139 --> 00:59:10.759]  Analysis.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:11.660]  InfoWars.
[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:13.822]  Building independent media operations.
[00:59:13.842 --> 00:59:18.686]  But the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:59:18.726 --> 00:59:19.687]  Prime Directive.
[00:59:19.767 --> 00:59:21.188]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:59:21.308 --> 00:59:24.090]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:27.233]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:59:27.413 --> 00:59:29.575]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:59:29.735 --> 00:59:31.195]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:59:31.215 --> 00:59:33.556]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:59:34.036 --> 00:59:35.717]  They are never going to stop.
[00:59:35.997 --> 00:59:39.918]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:59:40.018 --> 00:59:43.239]  Block free iPhone apps at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:43.639 --> 00:59:46.280]  Block free podcasts and video feeds.
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:47.740]  Imperative.
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:49.981]  Destroy Britain's limited TV.
[00:59:50.001 --> 00:59:54.442]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:59:54.702 --> 00:59:56.823]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[01:00:02.521 --> 01:00:16.704]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:18.485 --> 01:00:21.805]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:22.405 --> 01:00:24.626]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.866 --> 01:00:28.467]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[01:00:31.854 --> 01:00:38.439]  Coming up, as I said, we've got Mike Judge, Rowdy Rowdy Piper, Sean Stone, Willie Nelson, Russell Brand, and more in this hour.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:42.482]  Then Gerald Cilente joins us.
[01:00:42.642 --> 01:00:43.623]  I am not coming to you live.
[01:00:43.683 --> 01:00:44.404]  I taped this on...
[01:00:46.112 --> 01:00:47.113]  Almost at Christmas Eve.
[01:00:47.133 --> 01:00:51.255]  Hard to believe Christmas 2014 is gone on New Year's Eve.
[01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:57.499]  I appreciate the crew staying up here late to help us get this done and put together this special looking back.
[01:00:57.939 --> 01:01:01.041]  We've never really done this, re-aired interviews we did with famous people.
[01:01:01.601 --> 01:01:04.743]  We're also going to re-air interviews coming up in the next few months when we take off here and there.
[01:01:04.763 --> 01:01:09.486]  But just some of the most powerful news-breaking interviews, not so much with celebrities.
[01:01:10.387 --> 01:01:14.970]  But all these celebrities stick their neck out coming on the broadcast to speak out against the system.
[01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:19.693]  Here there's supposed to be a Democrat, a Communist, a Socialist, or maybe a few token Conservatives.
[01:01:20.033 --> 01:01:23.815]  But if you speak out against the whole system as a fraud construct, they come after you.
[01:01:23.855 --> 01:01:25.977]  So that's why I'm making a big deal out of that, because it is a big deal.
[01:01:27.298 --> 01:01:32.699]  Before I go any further, a Sony hackers threatened a US news media organization.
[01:01:32.739 --> 01:01:35.519]  The hackers who infiltrated Sony Pictures.
[01:01:35.539 --> 01:01:36.660]  I thought it was Kim Jong-un.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:47.262]  They're going to have an airdrop of the interview, supposedly some NGO, CIA connection group, of DVDs over North Korea.
[01:01:47.922 --> 01:01:50.582]  Almost no one has DVD players, even VHS players.
[01:01:50.882 --> 01:01:54.703]  They live in dirt floor shacks and work as slaves for a little pot-bellied demon creature.
[01:01:56.363 --> 01:02:00.306]  So all of you that love big government should love North Korea, but what a stunt!
[01:02:01.467 --> 01:02:03.969]  Well, now they admit it wasn't North Korea, that was all a hoax.
[01:02:04.489 --> 01:02:14.817]  Well, the hackers who infiltrated Sony Pictures Entertainment computers, servers, have threatened to attack an American news media organization according to the FBI bulletin obtained by The Intercept.
[01:02:15.337 --> 01:02:19.680]  But wait a minute, I thought the FBI said it was North Korea.
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.242]  Well, first they said it was an inside job.
[01:02:21.782 --> 01:02:22.823]  I think that's really what's going on.
[01:02:24.244 --> 01:02:32.909]  The threat against the unnamed news organization by the Guardians of Peace, the hacker group that has claimed credit with the Sunni attack, may extend to other organizations in the future.
[01:02:32.929 --> 01:02:39.354]  Well, don't worry, they're reintroducing the Cybersecurity Act to take over internet freedom next year to protect us.
[01:02:40.154 --> 01:02:43.876]  Then they got some zit-faced teenagers that actually think they're getting credit for everything.
[01:02:44.476 --> 01:02:45.737]  And I'm sure they're doing some of it.
[01:02:45.777 --> 01:02:46.557]  I'm not attacking them.
[01:02:46.597 --> 01:02:47.658]  A lot of hackers have helped us.
[01:02:48.018 --> 01:02:49.179]  Most hackers are white hats.
[01:02:49.879 --> 01:02:51.320]  Hell, we've had Captain Crunch on!
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:57.863]  Let's get Captain Crunch on Friday, tomorrow, to talk about all the hacking stuff.
[01:02:59.912 --> 01:03:21.829]  Referring to Sony only as Usurper 1 and news organization as Usurper 2, the Joint Intelligence Bulletin dated December 24th and marked for official use only, says its purpose is to provide information on the late November 2014 cyber intrusion target Usurper 1 and related threats concerning the planned release of the movie, The Interview.
[01:03:22.229 --> 01:03:28.354]  Additionally, these threats have extended to Usurper 2, a news organization, and may extend to other such organizations in the near future.
[01:03:28.914 --> 01:03:29.535]  Oh my gosh.
[01:03:31.326 --> 01:03:34.388]  So many times hacks turn out to be fake with fake info inserted.
[01:03:34.748 --> 01:03:39.291]  This just reeks of Sony and reeks of the White House and reeks, reeks, reeks.
[01:03:39.652 --> 01:03:40.552]  Holiday Horror!
[01:03:40.632 --> 01:03:44.775]  Mom fatally shot by two-year-old in Walmart.
[01:03:46.356 --> 01:03:47.157]  There's the answer.
[01:03:47.217 --> 01:03:48.838]  Secure firearms from children.
[01:03:50.188 --> 01:03:55.173]  So that's just some of the stuff that's always bubbling around sadly out there.
[01:03:55.893 --> 01:04:02.319]  Feds are now warning of more leaks, ABC News, threats to media from Sony hackers.
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:10.106]  This is a way to just make it sound more ominous and scary, instead of somebody just getting a movie early or getting it after it comes out and putting it on the internet.
[01:04:10.447 --> 01:04:14.531]  It's about, not just about mainstream media and the big movie houses,
[01:04:15.515 --> 01:04:16.437]  Stopping piracy.
[01:04:16.457 --> 01:04:22.953]  It's about them bringing in a surveillance tyranny to shut down film competition, music competition that they don't own or control.
[01:04:24.713 --> 01:04:32.400]  Federal authorities predict even more private, potentially embarrassing information from inside Sony Pictures could be made public now that the movie company has released its controversial film.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:38.065]  The interview and news outlets concerning the story should become the next victim of a major cyber attack.
[01:04:38.085 --> 01:04:42.009]  So, again, there's ABC News also reporting on that front.
[01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:45.012]  Some of the news from Infowars.com.
[01:04:47.259 --> 01:04:51.843]  Uh, fake feminist posts hateful tweets after actress says she loves serving her husband.
[01:04:52.364 --> 01:04:55.687]  Well, I mean, I love serving, you know, each other.
[01:04:55.707 --> 01:04:56.668]  I mean, you serve your woman.
[01:04:56.708 --> 01:04:57.689]  I mean, you serve your man.
[01:04:57.709 --> 01:04:58.970]  That's what it's all about.
[01:04:59.811 --> 01:05:01.853]  You know, male birds bring worms to females.
[01:05:03.514 --> 01:05:05.556]  TV host reported to police for hate crimes.
[01:05:05.576 --> 01:05:07.358]  We're asking why a fat person is fat.
[01:05:07.758 --> 01:05:08.338]  Stay with us!
[01:05:10.523 --> 01:05:15.904]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:17.164 --> 01:05:21.925]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:22.305 --> 01:05:28.846]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:33.207]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:05:35.088 --> 01:05:37.368]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:05:49.188 --> 01:05:51.069]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:05:51.329 --> 01:05:52.849]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:55.690]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:05:55.990 --> 01:06:02.251]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:06:02.631 --> 01:06:04.812]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:06:05.332 --> 01:06:06.752]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:06:06.912 --> 01:06:07.353]  Got it.
[01:06:07.693 --> 01:06:08.193]  Others don't.
[01:06:10.054 --> 01:06:11.275]  Another major health threat.
[01:06:11.295 --> 01:06:16.197]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:06:16.277 --> 01:06:18.918]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:06:18.958 --> 01:06:25.721]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:06:26.001 --> 01:06:28.842]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:06:28.982 --> 01:06:31.924]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:06:31.944 --> 01:06:33.925]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:06:33.965 --> 01:06:36.806]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:06:36.886 --> 01:06:42.388]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:06:42.608 --> 01:06:46.089]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:06:46.109 --> 01:06:49.110]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:56.312]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:12.542]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[01:07:12.642 --> 01:07:13.803]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[01:07:14.063 --> 01:07:15.545]  Even with diet and exercise.
[01:07:15.745 --> 01:07:20.790]  Because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[01:07:20.931 --> 01:07:27.758]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[01:07:28.058 --> 01:07:30.039]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.
[01:07:30.299 --> 01:07:36.882]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[01:07:37.122 --> 01:07:43.025]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining three essential formulations.

[01:08:13.044 --> 01:08:18.588]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:08:19.068 --> 01:08:21.610]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:08:22.602 --> 01:08:23.843]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.883 --> 01:08:26.966]  Thank you for joining us on this taped transmission.
[01:08:27.006 --> 01:08:29.668]  But it is 2015 as this goes out worldwide.
[01:08:29.688 --> 01:08:31.869]  I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m.
[01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:32.410]  to 2 p.m.
[01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:33.851]  Central, live.
[01:08:33.871 --> 01:08:39.716]  And then, of course, back on the Sunday transmission, live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:08:40.096 --> 01:08:41.137]  Central Standard Time.
[01:08:41.157 --> 01:08:42.418]  I want to say great job to the crew.
[01:08:42.878 --> 01:08:46.381]  In 2014, all of our affiliate sponsors, listeners, and the good Lord above.
[01:08:46.641 --> 01:08:49.404]  Here's our interviewer, part of it, with Mike Judge.
[01:08:57.984 --> 01:09:02.188]  I have a hard time saying I'm either a Democrat or a Republican.
[01:09:02.368 --> 01:09:04.310]  It just doesn't feel good.
[01:09:04.330 --> 01:09:06.431]  I was definitely raised, my parents were very liberal.
[01:09:09.174 --> 01:09:21.264]  Then, I don't know, certain things started to, you know, I mean, for a lot of people that's kind of almost a religion to them, and right-wing stuff is too, you know, so I try to not be part of any of that.
[01:09:21.865 --> 01:09:24.427]  I suppose I've become a
[01:09:28.195 --> 01:09:31.696]  Interested in, you know, smaller government kind of thinking.
[01:09:34.077 --> 01:09:48.262]  That sort of happens when, you know, I think you, you know, when you build your own thing, when you do your own thing and then suddenly you're getting penalized left and right, you know, that kind of can change you.
[01:09:48.282 --> 01:09:51.843]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:09:52.903 --> 01:09:54.424]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:09:57.423 --> 01:10:08.707]  I don't ever want to be one of those people that uses my whatever fame or whatever level of that notoriety I have from what I do in comedy to try to go into politics.
[01:10:08.747 --> 01:10:11.628]  I'm just like, I don't feel like I'm qualified.
[01:10:11.668 --> 01:10:23.952]  It kind of bugs me when people in Hollywood will use that, you know, their audience that they've gained through that to try to put out a political message when they have no idea what they're talking about.
[01:10:28.163 --> 01:10:50.531]  King of the Hill, Hank was definitely, you know, I saw as sort of a, I don't know, like populist kind of like, you know, a guy who's like just trying to do his thing and just all these government and all these other weird things of the modern world are, that was always the fun of it, is just all these things just kind of poking at him, you know?
[01:10:52.330 --> 01:10:56.893]  I live in the real world where men sell propane and propane accessories.
[01:10:57.953 --> 01:11:05.257]  I definitely remember popping into VHS when Alex Jones was on cable access.
[01:11:05.617 --> 01:11:09.699]  It was you and two other guys and somewhere I can't find it anymore.
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.721]  But I think I labeled the tape Three Dales.
[01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:17.383]  You were kind of the more rational one and the other two guys were just like
[01:11:18.803 --> 01:11:19.083]  I don't know.
[01:11:19.123 --> 01:11:20.804]  I wish I could find that tape.
[01:11:20.904 --> 01:11:25.427]  But, um, King of the Hill started with a drawing of the four guys that I'd done.
[01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:29.469]  I was kind of like dabbling and doing panel cartoons, which I never really did at all.
[01:11:29.509 --> 01:11:31.070]  I started, I went straight into animation.
[01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:33.171]  I didn't draw comic books or anything.
[01:11:34.091 --> 01:11:36.212]  And so, so I had the four guys and Dale
[01:11:37.891 --> 01:11:39.192]  Just something about the way he looked.
[01:11:39.232 --> 01:11:42.694]  Originally I had his hat say Smith & Wesson, the first drawing I ever did.
[01:11:42.794 --> 01:11:44.034]  I just put that on there.
[01:11:44.094 --> 01:11:47.156]  I don't know why, just the way he looked.
[01:11:48.156 --> 01:12:02.323]  I'd done a first draft of the pilot and then Greg Daniels got involved and at some point, you know, we had this thing where his wife is, you know, getting it on with this Native American healer and clearly this kid's not his.
[01:12:02.343 --> 01:12:06.486]  So we had this idea about that he's just, you know,
[01:12:07.748 --> 01:12:09.329]  It's almost probably a subconscious thing.
[01:12:09.369 --> 01:12:15.031]  He's like... He's into every conspiracy except the one that's going on in his own house.
[01:12:15.511 --> 01:12:17.212]  Nice work, John Redcorn.
[01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:18.592]  She didn't suspect a thing.
[01:12:18.872 --> 01:12:21.333]  It's almost like his escape, you know, or something.
[01:12:21.373 --> 01:12:27.575]  I mean, if... I never psychoanalyzed it that much, but I kind of feel like that's what that character was about.
[01:12:27.635 --> 01:12:33.418]  So he was almost like looking for conspiracies, you know, kind of... And some of them might have something to him.
[01:12:33.518 --> 01:12:34.378]  Some of them are crazy.
[01:12:36.175 --> 01:12:37.336]  I have read a book.
[01:12:37.936 --> 01:12:39.037]  Now, who do you believe?
[01:12:39.137 --> 01:12:40.118]  Me or Hank?
[01:12:40.358 --> 01:12:41.919]  I know Hank more believable.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:49.905]  Dale is kind of one of the ones that, you know, probably gives you guys a bad name.
[01:12:50.005 --> 01:12:52.467]  Johnny Hardwick, who does The Voice, I don't know, you may even know him.
[01:12:54.778 --> 01:12:59.463]  He had a few, like, he had a few kooky theories of his own, and sometimes we would work those in.
[01:12:59.503 --> 01:13:08.093]  I mean, there's one line he said that, he's talking about something, and it ended with him saying, something that they're doing, and corn is next.
[01:13:09.525 --> 01:13:17.471]  A French study that was just released finds rats that are fed genetically engineered corn suffered from tumors and severe organ damage.
[01:13:17.831 --> 01:13:24.416]  This is the first study that's looking at the effects on rats of eating genetically modified foods over their lifetimes.
[01:13:24.857 --> 01:13:27.318]  They gave the rats the genetically modified corn.
[01:13:27.819 --> 01:13:31.862]  They gave them the genetically modified corn with the herbicide that the corn is used with.
[01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:38.468]  You know, I grew up very liberal parents, like, thinking gun control is the way to go.
[01:13:38.488 --> 01:13:56.245]  You know, that Michael Moore movie, that was Bowling for Columbine, kind of actually made me go the other, made me think like, I mean, he's not trying to, that's not the effect he wanted, I don't think, but he's like kind of, that movie kind of makes you think,
[01:13:57.458 --> 01:13:58.819]  No, gun control's a bad idea.
[01:13:58.859 --> 01:14:09.283]  I mean, to me, if you look at it, like, I don't think that's what he's trying to do at all, but, like, he mentions Canada in there, and he says, you know, there's lower crime there, and same people on guns, and I don't know.
[01:14:09.623 --> 01:14:10.303]  I own guns.
[01:14:10.784 --> 01:14:16.166]  Um, it's, uh, I think if you look at it statistically, you actually are safer.
[01:14:16.986 --> 01:14:22.969]  I got me a couple AKs, some sawed-offs, 25 9mm, and a couple of ground-to-airs.
[01:14:23.409 --> 01:14:26.230]  I got a Ford up in the hills, virtually impenetrable,
[01:14:26.903 --> 01:14:29.445]  And enough supplies to outlast a 30-year standoff.
[01:14:30.845 --> 01:14:35.889]  I know this because, okay, so 1993, Beavis and Butthead, the series, came out.
[01:14:36.769 --> 01:14:42.332]  And gun crimes have gone down since Beavis and Butthead came out.
[01:14:42.372 --> 01:14:47.896]  What's interesting is that nobody talks about... No one wants statistics.
[01:14:48.036 --> 01:14:50.878]  I actually took graduate probability and statistics classes.
[01:14:51.018 --> 01:14:54.460]  I was going to become a math teacher before all this Beavis stuff happened.
[01:14:56.781 --> 01:15:10.029]  When I was getting blamed for all this, like, downfall of youth, that whole time, crime was going down in almost every category from the time... I mean, if you really wanted to make a correlation, you could say Beavis and Butthead is saving the world.
[01:15:10.069 --> 01:15:11.289]  But that's stupid.
[01:15:11.649 --> 01:15:12.850]  That really doesn't make any sense.
[01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:24.557]  But it makes more sense than saying, this particular thing happened and this particular thing happened, you know, but... But really, like, statistically, there's no correlation.
[01:15:26.969 --> 01:15:28.330]  Alright, who are you?
[01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:29.270]  CIA?
[01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:29.670]  FBI?
[01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:29.770]  ATF?
[01:15:46.989 --> 01:15:53.914]  I think because I have this science background, I just, you look at that and you go, you know, that's, it's kind of ridiculous.
[01:15:54.134 --> 01:16:06.303]  As much as, you know, those bumper stickers might have been run into the ground, I mean, it's true, it's like, I would be all for it if it was effective, but it's, I haven't seen anything that shows it's effective, you know?
[01:16:06.383 --> 01:16:08.925]  Well Mao said political power goes out of the barrel of a gun.
[01:16:09.185 --> 01:16:11.988]  What does Hank Hill say about disarming people?
[01:16:14.907 --> 01:16:20.051]  It is the right of all Americans, as Cotton has taught me, to own a gun.
[01:16:20.931 --> 01:16:23.033]  Even though I'm not so good at shooting them.
[01:16:23.353 --> 01:16:27.856]  A Japanese machine gun blew my shins off in WW2!
[01:16:29.177 --> 01:16:29.637]  I loved it.
[01:16:31.522 --> 01:16:34.763]  It's good to see somebody yelling at Piers Morgan.
[01:16:34.783 --> 01:16:37.444]  You excuse me of attacking the Second Amendment of the Constitution.
[01:16:37.464 --> 01:16:41.565]  I want to get people off pills that the insert says would make you commit suicide and kill people!
[01:16:41.605 --> 01:16:41.785]  Alex!
[01:16:41.805 --> 01:16:41.925]  Alex!
[01:16:41.945 --> 01:16:42.125]  Alex!
[01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:43.986]  Let's get him out to the Second Amendment.
[01:16:44.006 --> 01:16:45.486]  I want to blame the real culprit!
[01:16:45.606 --> 01:16:45.886]  Alex!
[01:16:45.946 --> 01:16:46.767]  Suicide pills!
[01:16:46.847 --> 01:16:47.127]  Alex!
[01:16:47.447 --> 01:16:48.587]  Mass murder pills!
[01:16:48.607 --> 01:16:49.748]  Okay, let me ask you one question.
[01:16:50.248 --> 01:16:55.930]  It was interesting, though, the way it seemed to be spun on all these websites.
[01:16:55.970 --> 01:17:00.231]  There's all these websites now that have a bunch of hipsters on them.
[01:17:01.181 --> 01:17:05.762]  Who will just kind of, like, kind of play a clip and grin and chuckle about it.
[01:17:05.982 --> 01:17:06.663]  That's how I saw it.
[01:17:06.683 --> 01:17:07.763]  I can't remember what it was on.
[01:17:07.943 --> 01:17:10.024]  I was thinking, hey, right on.
[01:17:10.284 --> 01:17:11.144]  Alex, go for it.
[01:17:12.244 --> 01:17:13.645]  Well, and everything you were saying was true, too.
[01:17:14.625 --> 01:17:15.945]  I mean, the clip that I saw.
[01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:17.846]  Yeah, you were talking about, yeah.
[01:17:18.866 --> 01:17:19.726]  Hitler took the guns!
[01:17:20.047 --> 01:17:21.087]  Stalin took the guns!
[01:17:21.407 --> 01:17:22.407]  Mao took the guns!
[01:17:22.668 --> 01:17:23.168]  Fidel!
[01:17:25.009 --> 01:17:28.470]  And if you try to take our guns, 1776 will commence again!
[01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:34.853]  If you try to take our firearms, doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street, begging for them to have their guns taken.
[01:17:35.073 --> 01:17:36.373]  We will not relinquish them.
[01:17:36.593 --> 01:17:37.554]  Do you understand?
[01:17:39.174 --> 01:17:39.775]  Something like that.
[01:17:40.395 --> 01:17:41.755]  You know, I used to do you really well.
[01:17:42.035 --> 01:17:43.116]  I can't, like, it was the...
[01:17:45.322 --> 01:17:47.143]  How was the water filter commercial you used to do?
[01:17:47.503 --> 01:17:50.185]  It's been a while.
[01:17:51.025 --> 01:17:52.466]  You'd think I'd have it down now though.
[01:17:52.486 --> 01:17:54.547]  I was just like hanging out with you last night.
[01:17:56.688 --> 01:17:58.109]  Look at these headlines.
[01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:03.552]  IRS targeted Tea Party groups for scrutiny.
[01:18:03.972 --> 01:18:06.474]  Searching words like Patriot, Tea Party.
[01:18:07.116 --> 01:18:07.997]  That does scare me.
[01:18:08.777 --> 01:18:13.961]  I think I'm just going to make sure to not use the words Tea Party or Constitution in any of my work.
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:26.164]  Yeah, uh, well it's, uh, they're calling it, uh, the Constitutional Restrictions or whatever they refer to it as.
[01:18:27.224 --> 01:18:30.186]  Yeah, uh, that was, uh, that actually is scary.
[01:18:30.546 --> 01:18:35.249]  That, uh, yeah, that, that's gonna make me listen to some more Alex Jones.
[01:18:35.269 --> 01:18:40.232]  Come on, I wanna see it, I wanna see it!
[01:18:40.272 --> 01:18:42.033]  Yeah, come on, Stewart, do it.
[01:19:03.407 --> 01:19:12.450]  Well if I was to get heavy and deep on it I think the one thing that's made me tick or makes me I mean other than just wanting to try to be funny it tends to be
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:19.462]  And I didn't, I don't overanalyze, but then, you know, when you do this long enough, you do analyze.
[01:19:19.762 --> 01:19:28.265]  I think what it is, is probably, I think a lot of us are just kind of out of sync with the way the world is right now, you know?
[01:19:28.385 --> 01:19:38.889]  Like the way, the modern world, we're not, we're not prepared for it all the time, and there's a lot of stuff that's messed up about it, and I think that's where a lot of my comedy comes from.
[01:19:38.929 --> 01:19:39.890]  It's like things that, um,
[01:19:41.167 --> 01:19:46.973]  You know, anything from being stuck in a cubicle to being stuck in classrooms that you don't belong in, those kind of things.
[01:19:47.173 --> 01:19:50.717]  I think that I get a lot of material out of that.
[01:19:51.057 --> 01:19:51.938]  I gotta get out of here.
[01:19:51.978 --> 01:19:52.899]  I think I'm gonna lose it.
[01:19:53.419 --> 01:19:53.840]  Uh-oh.
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:56.783]  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:13.822]  The CDC just announced flu vaccines may have the wrong strain of flu virus.

[01:22:11.637 --> 01:22:14.899]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:22:15.179 --> 01:22:16.981]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:22:17.341 --> 01:22:26.367]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[01:22:26.647 --> 01:22:32.291]  Plus, Big Berkey water filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.

[01:24:10.225 --> 01:24:12.748]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[01:24:13.288 --> 01:24:15.971]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[01:24:19.901 --> 01:24:28.887]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[01:24:30.267 --> 01:24:31.808]  And I hope that judge ain't blind.
[01:24:32.429 --> 01:24:38.653]  The great pleasure of this broadcast is that we get to talk to people like Rowdy Rowdy Piper and Sean Stone.
[01:24:38.773 --> 01:24:41.194]  You know, of They Live and wrestling fame.
[01:24:41.494 --> 01:24:47.158]  The big deal is he's a patriot and wants to fight the new world order and he's come here to chew bubblegum and do you know what.
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:53.363]  We have been lulled into a trance.
[01:24:53.523 --> 01:24:57.547]  They have made us indifferent to ourselves, to others.
[01:24:58.067 --> 01:25:00.730]  We are focused only on our own gains.
[01:25:01.511 --> 01:25:04.033]  More and more people are becoming poor.
[01:25:04.714 --> 01:25:05.975]  We are their cattle.
[01:25:06.436 --> 01:25:08.858]  We are being bred for slavery.
[01:25:08.918 --> 01:25:10.840]  They want benign indifference.
[01:25:11.281 --> 01:25:12.522]  They want us drugged.
[01:25:18.805 --> 01:25:27.249]  It is one of my favorite all-time movies and it really gets you to think outside the box and of course I grew up watching him on television as well.
[01:25:27.610 --> 01:25:36.634]  It's super exciting to have Rowdy Roddy Piper on with us today from Los Angeles there in Sean Stone's living room.
[01:25:36.694 --> 01:25:37.695]  Both guys are with us.
[01:25:38.275 --> 01:25:39.076]  And, you know, it's great.
[01:25:39.096 --> 01:25:40.818]  I've gotten to be good friends with Jesse Ventura.
[01:25:40.878 --> 01:25:45.862]  I know these two guys are friends as well, or have been in the past, and so now I get to talk to both of them.
[01:25:46.383 --> 01:25:53.930]  And Mr. Piper, formerly, of course, born Roderick George Toombs, it is great to have you on the World Wide Broadcast, sir.
[01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:56.672]  Would you mind just introducing me every place I go?
[01:25:57.673 --> 01:25:59.495]  That was a fantastic introduction.
[01:26:01.243 --> 01:26:02.243]  Well, it's great to have you on.
[01:26:02.304 --> 01:26:05.205]  I tell you, so much is happening in the world, but let's get into They Live.
[01:26:05.225 --> 01:26:10.627]  You've been in a lot of movies, but what's your take on the 25th anniversary of They Live?
[01:26:10.787 --> 01:26:14.829]  The movie They Live, when it was made, was more about Reaganomics at the time.
[01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:26.615]  But with the, uh, as music lulls you to sleep, conspiracies, one of the things that the movie has done is it's taken on a life of its own.
[01:26:28.436 --> 01:26:35.579]  It never gets old as we see the world evolve and try to make us a little chip.
[01:26:35.699 --> 01:26:37.921]  The same thing's happening over and over again.
[01:26:38.441 --> 01:26:43.804]  You watch they live and it gives you, it's kind of like the cliff notes for what's going on.
[01:26:44.484 --> 01:26:52.068]  John Carpenter, when we shot this scene with the homeless people, he actually used the homeless people there.
[01:26:52.128 --> 01:26:53.229]  John is a big activist.
[01:26:53.689 --> 01:26:55.710]  You know, and I give him all the respect in the world for that.
[01:26:57.231 --> 01:27:01.413]  And, you know, turning out and showing what the world has become.
[01:27:01.453 --> 01:27:03.494]  I don't know why America has homeless people.
[01:27:04.835 --> 01:27:05.495]  It's terrible.
[01:27:05.535 --> 01:27:11.838]  But also another thing we had to do was pay off the gangs so they wouldn't come and wreck our trailers.
[01:27:11.878 --> 01:27:16.220]  So there was, you know, little conspiracy, little gangs for
[01:27:17.501 --> 01:27:28.511]  Warfare, then there would be the homeless people we take care of, and it really became a venture of love to a certain point and trying to do the right thing.
[01:27:28.891 --> 01:27:31.173]  Again, I give all the credit to John on that.
[01:27:31.633 --> 01:27:32.915]  My favorite part of the film?
[01:27:34.796 --> 01:27:42.083]  I think when the character Nada looks up and he says, I believe in America.
[01:27:44.443 --> 01:27:48.529]  I think that's probably the biggest statement of the entire movie.
[01:27:49.089 --> 01:27:49.951]  There's one thing that
[01:27:51.363 --> 01:27:52.523]  That can escape people.
[01:27:52.563 --> 01:28:01.967]  If you don't have somebody personal to you that has been harmed by the conspiracies and all the tributaries that lead to that or run off that.
[01:28:02.487 --> 01:28:12.771]  If you don't have someone close to you shaking at night time because he got blown up twice, went over again and got blown up two times, then it doesn't mean so much to you.
[01:28:12.791 --> 01:28:16.493]  You know, every time we want to go to war, send your boy to war.
[01:28:17.355 --> 01:28:18.437]  My boy's already been there.
[01:28:18.857 --> 01:28:20.920]  Hey, there's mind control going on.
[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:24.425]  The signal's broadcast 24 hours a day through all this media.
[01:28:24.745 --> 01:28:27.489]  Just become aware of it, and they'll say there's nothing going on.
[01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:31.814]  And I want to say, put on these glasses or start chewing concrete!
[01:28:33.596 --> 01:28:34.757]  There are sociopaths.
[01:28:35.117 --> 01:28:39.140]  There are people as part of the population that have no emotion.
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:39.921]  They are not human.
[01:28:40.061 --> 01:28:50.189]  And I think the human race has not yet come to terms with the fact that there is 10% of the population that are sociopathic, that do not have human emotion or boundaries, and they are not human.
[01:28:50.449 --> 01:28:58.716]  So when we say, hey, we'll give him a pass, he's human, hey, he made a mistake, we're not understanding fundamentally that they were talking about.
[01:28:59.176 --> 01:29:03.002]  Is a small percentage of the population that does not care about humanity.
[01:29:03.282 --> 01:29:07.108]  Do you think the world is putting on the black sunglasses more and more?
[01:29:07.128 --> 01:29:14.519]  The real men of the world have to stand up and say, I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass!
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.681]  I'm all out of bubble gum!
[01:29:17.741 --> 01:29:20.984]  Time to take a stand, boys!
[01:29:21.364 --> 01:29:25.186]  Again, they, they, you need to stand up against they.
[01:29:25.327 --> 01:29:28.909]  And I, yes, yes, the ads are coming into that tunnel.
[01:29:29.109 --> 01:29:31.431]  It's like where the Illuminati have their meetings.
[01:29:32.854 --> 01:29:34.555]  You know anything about those meetings?
[01:29:34.935 --> 01:29:35.876]  Do I know anything about them?
[01:29:36.356 --> 01:29:38.458]  I'd like to go in there and say hi to those guys.
[01:29:39.979 --> 01:29:42.340]  Well, Sean, I bet you know about those meetings.
[01:29:43.141 --> 01:29:45.382]  I haven't been invited yet, but I think it's time he and I do a movie.
[01:29:45.522 --> 01:29:47.183]  And we'll go chew gum together.
[01:29:47.323 --> 01:29:47.844]  There you go.
[01:29:47.864 --> 01:29:48.444]  Have some fun.
[01:29:48.704 --> 01:29:51.106]  Well, folks, Rowdy, Sean, stay there.
[01:29:51.126 --> 01:29:52.407]  I'm going to say bye to you at the end of the show.
[01:29:52.667 --> 01:29:53.707]  This has been an amazing interview.
[01:29:54.008 --> 01:29:55.388]  Thank you both for your time.
[01:29:55.589 --> 01:29:57.570]  And Mr. Piper, it's good to know you.
[01:29:59.298 --> 01:30:02.246]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[01:31:43.588 --> 01:31:47.550]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:49.331]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:31:49.651 --> 01:31:57.236]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[01:32:09.705 --> 01:32:12.288]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[01:32:12.388 --> 01:32:13.529]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:15.271]  Even with diet and exercise.
[01:32:15.472 --> 01:32:20.517]  Because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[01:32:20.657 --> 01:32:27.505]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[01:32:27.805 --> 01:32:29.788]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.
[01:32:30.029 --> 01:32:36.599]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[01:32:36.859 --> 01:32:42.789]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining three essential formulations.

[01:32:59.302 --> 01:33:02.445]  2015 is the year to do it and it all starts at Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:13.906 --> 01:33:16.874]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:17.495 --> 01:33:21.625]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:25.689 --> 01:33:35.556]  One of the fun parts about this job, trying to be a watchman on the wall, as imperfect as I am, is that I have been contacted and reached out to by so many amazing people.
[01:33:36.617 --> 01:33:37.878]  And one of them is Willie Nelson.
[01:33:37.898 --> 01:33:42.681]  I've been to his house repeatedly, played chess with him, hung out, been around on the bus, been to concerts.
[01:33:43.402 --> 01:33:50.247]  I met him one time when I was sitting there signing DVDs at Alamo Draft House on South Lamar in Austin.
[01:33:50.947 --> 01:33:51.768]  This has got to be like 2000
[01:33:53.957 --> 01:33:54.837]  Five or something.
[01:33:54.857 --> 01:33:59.999]  This interview you're about to hear is from 2008, and Willie Nelson is like 81 years old.
[01:34:00.039 --> 01:34:02.260]  He's still pretty much there, but not like he was back then.
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.440]  Plus, he smokes a lot of marijuana, but he's a great guy.
[01:34:05.941 --> 01:34:08.081]  Comes from the same area, Texas, my dad does.
[01:34:09.822 --> 01:34:13.143]  I just say that because there's a lot of Willie Nelson types, you know, out in the hills.
[01:34:13.163 --> 01:34:16.224]  He calls himself a hillbilly, and I guess I'm a little bit hillbilly.
[01:34:16.604 --> 01:34:20.205]  But all of a sudden, walking around the counter to where I'm at is Willie Nelson, and he shakes my hand.
[01:34:21.109 --> 01:34:47.456]  buys an in-game DVD and says give me your phone number so I give him my phone number and about six months later my producer during the show would have my phone people calling it and he goes yeah it's Willie Nelson he wants to talk to you during a break and I get on and goes hi this is Willie I really like your film in-game you know we need to get together sometime have a concert or something to wake people up about 9-11 and what's happened to this country and
[01:34:49.787 --> 01:34:51.368]  Again, Bush was a tyrant.
[01:34:51.468 --> 01:34:53.289]  Obama's been, in many ways, even worse.
[01:34:53.389 --> 01:34:56.651]  But the point is, is that Willie Nelson spoke out against Bush and his tyranny.
[01:34:57.251 --> 01:35:00.353]  And he said that he's been, you know, displeased with some of the things Obama's done as well.
[01:35:00.373 --> 01:35:02.414]  But it was just fun to get to know Willie Nelson.
[01:35:02.434 --> 01:35:04.095]  And then Ventura came down a few times.
[01:35:04.115 --> 01:35:05.336]  We hung out with Nelson as well.
[01:35:06.537 --> 01:35:08.478]  It's just good to know these mavericks.
[01:35:09.038 --> 01:35:10.319]  Folks that are really different.
[01:35:11.198 --> 01:35:16.463]  Uh, and that are true bonafide originals and Willie Nelson is one of those.
[01:35:16.823 --> 01:35:26.152]  So here's an excerpt of one of many interviews I've done, uh, with Mr. Nelson and then Russell Brand, the big global firebrand comedian, the one that was married to Katy Perry.
[01:35:26.172 --> 01:35:27.754]  I learned that he and her both listen to the show.
[01:35:28.014 --> 01:35:29.235]  I've had Katy Perry's dad on.
[01:35:29.415 --> 01:35:32.158]  Just showing you how many people are awake to the new world order.
[01:35:32.478 --> 01:35:33.299]  Here is Willie Nelson.
[01:35:33.559 --> 01:35:34.981]  Mr. Nelson, thank you for joining us.
[01:35:35.999 --> 01:35:37.079]  Oh, my pleasure, Alex.
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:38.660]  It's good to be on your show.
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:39.600]  I hope you're doing good.
[01:35:40.321 --> 01:35:42.201]  Man, it's the best of times, the worst of times.
[01:35:42.241 --> 01:35:42.822]  Life's great.
[01:35:42.842 --> 01:35:44.142]  It's beautiful in Austin, Texas.
[01:35:44.682 --> 01:35:46.523]  We've got great people like Willie Nelson out there.
[01:35:46.723 --> 01:35:53.866]  I wanted to get you on to get your take on Dennis Kucinich and impeachment and find out if you're supporting it, and if so, why.
[01:35:55.313 --> 01:36:05.611]  Well first of all Dennis Kucinich is a great friend of mine and I've supported him ever since I've known him and I've always admired him.
[01:36:07.731 --> 01:36:08.472]  I don't think so.
[01:36:28.268 --> 01:36:36.837]  And it pretty much tells where we are today, just how much is a human life worth, how much all is a human life worth these days.
[01:36:37.798 --> 01:36:42.363]  There has to be a price tag on it or else we wouldn't be going around the world killing people overall.
[01:36:43.645 --> 01:36:47.269]  I love the way Dennis is handling the impeachment thing.
[01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:59.163]  I think he's got, what, 54 impeachment charges against George and there's probably another 54 laying around out there if he wants to go get them.
[01:37:00.044 --> 01:37:00.525]  Absolutely.
[01:37:00.545 --> 01:37:01.325]  He first introduced 35.
[01:37:01.986 --> 01:37:04.727]  Instead of Congress didn't act, he would add more, and he has.
[01:37:05.488 --> 01:37:18.297]  He did pressure them, the Democratic Congress that was supposedly elected to punish Bush's crimes and end the war, now becoming very transparent that they're in the same military-industrial complex hip pocket of those special interests.
[01:37:19.477 --> 01:37:28.604]  But he was able to get the Judiciary Committee to hear his charges coming up this Friday, and I just wanted to put the call out
[01:37:29.401 --> 01:37:38.726]  For everybody to call the House Judiciary Committee and to call all of your members of Congress and tell them, look, it's admitted that the wiretapping of U.S.
[01:37:38.746 --> 01:37:41.267]  citizens without warrants, each counts a felony.
[01:37:41.587 --> 01:37:48.431]  It's admitted that lying about WMDs in Iraq, and it's come out, we have the White House documents that they knew they were lying, those are felonies.
[01:37:49.451 --> 01:38:02.757]  The main thing that bothers me, I think, is the fact that anyone in this country can get by with murder if they happen to be the President of the United States and have all of the government behind them.
[01:38:03.237 --> 01:38:04.558]  And I don't think that's right.
[01:38:04.698 --> 01:38:08.740]  I think if I get caught on the street smoking a joint, I'm going to jail.
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:14.162]  Of all the articles of impeachment, which ones do you think are most important?
[01:38:14.818 --> 01:38:21.485]  Well, I probably couldn't name the articles of impeachment by name, but I do know that it was wrong for him to go to war.
[01:38:21.565 --> 01:38:29.953]  I do know that a lot of our guys and gals have lost their lives and lives have been ruined forever because of the law that he broke.
[01:38:30.574 --> 01:38:34.798]  And for that alone, he should have to pay for it.
[01:38:37.381 --> 01:38:37.981]  In some way.
[01:38:57.330 --> 01:39:00.973]  And that anything this guy does between now and election day could spark it.
[01:39:01.434 --> 01:39:05.577]  I think an impeachment hearing between now and then might slow the guy down.
[01:39:05.978 --> 01:39:12.923]  It might get the attention of the world and us on trying to stop a guy who's really intent on starting a war.
[01:39:13.784 --> 01:39:14.285]  Well, you're right.
[01:39:14.345 --> 01:39:18.789]  And it also shows the world that we're serious about getting our name back.
[01:39:18.809 --> 01:39:22.673]  I mean, we've always been known, not as being perfect, but as the good guys.
[01:39:23.354 --> 01:39:25.275]  And now we are... We don't have to do that.
[01:39:25.315 --> 01:39:33.904]  We might, you know... In fact, I think we should set ourselves up as the world's peacemakers, not the world's warmongers.
[01:39:34.745 --> 01:39:36.967]  There is a place in the world for a peacemaker.
[01:39:37.027 --> 01:39:37.688]  We all know that.
[01:39:38.633 --> 01:39:39.174]  Absolutely.
[01:39:39.214 --> 01:39:44.879]  So I think it's important for the world to see that the American people are at least attempting to see that justice is done.
[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:46.661]  Absolutely.
[01:39:47.421 --> 01:39:48.022]  Now, you were right.
[01:39:48.062 --> 01:39:50.144]  That is the second article of impeachment.
[01:39:50.624 --> 01:39:56.810]  It is falsely, systematically, and with criminal intent, conflating the attacks of September 11th with
[01:39:59.801 --> 01:40:05.682]  A mispresentation of Iraq as a security threat, as part of a fraudulent justification for the war of aggression.
[01:40:06.143 --> 01:40:11.344]  And we now have the memos, the White House memos and others, where they knew Iraq had nothing to do with it.
[01:40:11.904 --> 01:40:15.125]  Of course, they knew that from day one, being the authors of the attacks, the 9-11 attacks.
[01:40:15.565 --> 01:40:17.886]  But that they were going to go out and sell the public on this.
[01:40:18.246 --> 01:40:22.667]  And now, conservatively, there's a million dead Iraqis because of this.
[01:40:22.707 --> 01:40:27.328]  I mean, this is Nazi-level, World War II-level crimes.
[01:40:29.770 --> 01:40:32.391]  No, this is very, very serious.
[01:40:32.411 --> 01:40:37.494]  There's a lot of people dying today because of that huge law that he broke.
[01:40:38.035 --> 01:40:40.056]  And no, I don't think he should get by with it.
[01:40:40.076 --> 01:40:41.697]  I don't think any of those guys in there.
[01:40:42.157 --> 01:40:43.558]  And he's not the only one.
[01:40:43.598 --> 01:40:46.259]  You know, he's just the puppet on the string.
[01:40:46.279 --> 01:40:48.760]  There's a lot of people telling him what to do.
[01:40:48.881 --> 01:40:52.763]  And, you know, they're using small words and big letters so he can get it said.
[01:40:53.083 --> 01:40:56.585]  But there are people behind him telling him what to do.
[01:40:57.438 --> 01:41:03.622]  Would you like to see the New World Order puppeteers controlling the marionette to be brought to justice as well, Willie?
[01:41:04.683 --> 01:41:05.624]  I think they have to.
[01:41:05.664 --> 01:41:07.245]  You just can't bring in the puppets.
[01:41:07.285 --> 01:41:09.386]  You've got to bring in the guys pulling the strings.
[01:41:09.467 --> 01:41:17.432]  The press wasn't perfect back in the 70s, back in 73, 74, but at least they did cover the investigation and the movement towards impeachment with Richard Nixon.
[01:41:18.733 --> 01:41:26.839]  I think that's the missing link here, is that the media, you're seeing almost no coverage of what Congressman Kucinich and all of his co-sponsors are doing.
[01:41:27.319 --> 01:41:38.352]  Well, yeah, that's another problem that we have, is getting the message across because the media people seem to be happy just telling the other side.
[01:41:38.372 --> 01:41:42.536]  You know, they know that they'll get in trouble themselves.
[01:41:42.577 --> 01:41:45.580]  They'll lose their jobs if they start talking like you and I are doing.
[01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:53.983]  Shifting gears into the economy, you know, you've been involved with Farm Aid and so much more, aware of how this international bank, central banks operate.
[01:41:54.163 --> 01:42:09.009]  We've got the IMF and World Bank documents where they admit they are engineering the implosion in our economy so they can consolidate wealth and basically repossess America, come in and buy all of our companies, Anheuser-Busch, real estate, car companies.
[01:42:09.989 --> 01:42:11.449]  Willie Nelson, what's your take on that?
[01:42:11.529 --> 01:42:12.750]  What's happening right now with the economy?
[01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:16.191]  Well, I can see where they've done it with the farmers.
[01:42:16.231 --> 01:42:31.235]  We used to have 8 million small family farmers out there and through various techniques, illegal and whatever, they have taken back over 6 million of those small family farms and they've done it by doing exactly what you said.
[01:42:31.275 --> 01:42:39.538]  They dropped the prices on everything, putting farmers out of business all over the world just so they can pick up the land and use it to their advantage.
[01:42:40.559 --> 01:42:42.640]  The big corporations want to do it all.
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:45.683]  They want to put all the small family farmers out of business.
[01:42:45.703 --> 01:42:54.930]  And I still think that this whole thing, our entire economy, that agriculture is the bottom rung on our economic ladder.
[01:42:55.390 --> 01:42:59.353]  And the farmer is our backbone of that economic ladder.
[01:42:59.453 --> 01:43:02.996]  So we have to bring the farmer back, the small family farmer.
[01:43:03.036 --> 01:43:06.659]  We have to start thinking locally, sustainable agriculture.
[01:43:07.384 --> 01:43:15.407]  Since you last came on the show and went public for 9-11 Truth, Jesse Ventura came on the show and then told me behind the scenes, he goes, look, I want to come out for 9-11 Truth.
[01:43:15.427 --> 01:43:20.809]  You gave me films years ago when I was in Texas visiting with Willie Nelson and Kinky Friedman.
[01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:23.830]  When I saw him at an event, he said, but now I've looked into it.
[01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:24.731]  It's an inside job.
[01:43:25.051 --> 01:43:28.892]  He went public and even Fox News had trouble attacking him.
[01:43:29.192 --> 01:43:32.854]  Now we've had the former Italian president, who was also the head of Intelligence, go public.
[01:43:33.174 --> 01:43:35.775]  German defense ministers, leaders in the Japanese Diet,
[01:43:36.115 --> 01:43:36.475]  Well, it's great.
[01:43:53.139 --> 01:43:58.383]  We do know that there are some strong people in this country and around the world who will stand up for what's right.
[01:43:59.484 --> 01:44:05.909]  It's always gratifying to see a guy jump up and say what he thinks to stand up for what he believes is right.
[01:44:07.050 --> 01:44:10.252]  I can see more and more people doing that these days.
[01:44:10.673 --> 01:44:11.994]  It is very gratifying.
[01:44:12.214 --> 01:44:15.036]  When you look at it for what it is, it's no big deal.
[01:44:15.116 --> 01:44:19.420]  Somebody did something wrong and somebody needs to be outed for it.
[01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:22.162]  Once you look at all the facts and see the pictures
[01:44:22.982 --> 01:44:24.703]  And, uh, you hear all the stories.
[01:44:24.723 --> 01:44:28.105]  It doesn't take a German scientist to realize it.
[01:44:28.745 --> 01:44:32.367]  We got hit, you know, by some inside people there.
[01:44:32.407 --> 01:44:33.747]  We need to find out who it is.
[01:44:34.048 --> 01:44:43.472]  Willie, what has the response been like since you came on my radio show twice and then on, of course, Free Speech TV and Democracy Now!, and, you know, questioned the official fable.
[01:44:43.512 --> 01:44:47.154]  What has the response been like from your fans, from your supporters, and your detractors?
[01:44:48.718 --> 01:44:57.308]  99% in favor of what we've been saying and 100% of ours believing that we have the right to say it.
[01:44:57.849 --> 01:44:59.611]  There's nobody that said, hey, shut up.
[01:45:04.161 --> 01:45:07.303]  Well, folks, I've wanted to get him on for a long time.
[01:45:07.384 --> 01:45:16.070]  Russell Brand, who is a comedian, best-selling author, actor, TV host, you name it, who has been popular for many years, but he's really a sensation now.
[01:45:16.511 --> 01:45:20.534]  The whole office today, when they found out he was coming on, got really excited.
[01:45:20.574 --> 01:45:22.315]  We have a lot of big guests on.
[01:45:22.936 --> 01:45:26.879]  Bottom line, what is front and center most important to you right now that's happening in the world?
[01:45:28.431 --> 01:45:46.189]  I think the thing that is most important to me, the thing that I'm talking about in my show, is the cultural narratives that we are told, the way that we are presented with information, the way that meaning is designated, the significance that is given to certain issues and not to others, and the light in which stories are told.
[01:45:46.529 --> 01:45:48.892]  So I think that that could obviously comprise
[01:45:50.253 --> 01:45:53.477]  Edward Snowden or it could comprise Syria.
[01:45:53.878 --> 01:46:05.712]  It could comprise more broadly the manufacture of consent or the manipulation of the consciousness of civilization through a conglomeration of government, big business and media.
[01:46:06.792 --> 01:46:17.356]  Coming into this interview, we played a clip when you were on MSNBC and that really struck a chord with people when you just laughed at their narcissism and said, you don't talk about anything real.
[01:46:17.777 --> 01:46:19.557]  You're basically a bunch of peacocks up here.
[01:46:21.178 --> 01:46:22.939]  What was it like behind the scenes?
[01:46:23.139 --> 01:46:30.342]  And it seemed like you were clashing with them and it really captured people's imagination.
[01:46:30.722 --> 01:46:31.822]  What happened there?
[01:46:31.842 --> 01:46:32.783]  Because you were in the middle of it.
[01:46:33.985 --> 01:46:43.375]  Well, I mean, it's quite typical when you go on those type of TV shows that there's a particular frequency or pitch to the interview.
[01:46:43.415 --> 01:46:49.602]  There's a normal manner of speaking, not only the type of topics that are discussed, but the kind of
[01:46:52.705 --> 01:47:05.200]  The information is predicated on celebrity and gossip and what I would call low-frequency data.
[01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:08.801]  Why do you think you shook him up so bad?
[01:47:36.557 --> 01:47:37.117]  I don't know.
[01:47:37.137 --> 01:47:45.322]  I'm a bit confused by it, because I just went on there and did what I normally do, which is just be polite, and then if I point out something idiosyncratic or weird, I observe that.
[01:47:45.682 --> 01:47:56.267]  But don't you think, Alex, that you deal with so much duplicity, whether in a situation where you're in an interview on the TV or on the radio, or if you're making a purchase in a shop.
[01:47:56.607 --> 01:48:01.950]  Sometimes we lose our authenticity, our ability to be human and truthful with one another.
[01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:08.754]  So I think if you interact in a very human and truthful way, then that can be very disruptive.
[01:48:09.315 --> 01:48:12.757]  It's not like there are certain individuals that are good and certain individuals that are bad.
[01:48:12.777 --> 01:48:23.585]  I know myself that, you know, I work in films and I've worked a lot in media, so I must be culpable as well for propagating these ideas and supporting them in my own way and on a bad day.
[01:48:23.645 --> 01:48:31.170]  Like just now, I arrived at Seattle Airport and there were people that wanted autographs and they were the kind of people that sell the photographs
[01:48:31.730 --> 01:48:32.311]  We're good to go.
[01:48:57.210 --> 01:49:17.895]  But like, I think it's more of a problem when you have a massive machine that conducts consciousness and orchestrates the way that we think en masse that has a set of priorities and an agenda that is making people in huge numbers think in a selfish, insular, atomized, apathetic and impotent way.
[01:49:18.375 --> 01:49:18.615]  Wow!
[01:49:19.736 --> 01:49:21.058]  Man, I tell you, you're on fire.
[01:49:21.078 --> 01:49:23.662]  It seems like you have really had an awakening.
[01:49:23.722 --> 01:49:28.809]  I mean, you've been awake for a long time, but it seems like your awakening is accelerating.
[01:49:29.190 --> 01:49:30.151]  Is that accurate to say?
[01:49:31.229 --> 01:49:33.891]  Yeah, I think you might be right, as a matter of fact.
[01:49:34.632 --> 01:49:38.255]  Alex, for me spirituality is an important component.
[01:49:38.955 --> 01:49:48.383]  I meditate a lot and I practice certain spiritual principles that mean I have to be very mindful one day at a time about the way I live my life.
[01:49:48.463 --> 01:49:55.769]  I'm like a drug and alcohol free and the more that I've detached myself from the things I thought would make me happy, like
[01:49:56.309 --> 01:50:02.258]  Money and fame and other people's opinions, the more truth is being revealed.
[01:50:03.662 --> 01:50:04.983]  Ah, that is pure Veritas.
[01:50:06.104 --> 01:50:08.045]  Because that's been my experience as well.
[01:50:08.185 --> 01:50:17.571]  And what you were just talking about, just being aware that you're being selfish or doing things that are self-centered or narcissistic is half the battle.
[01:50:18.372 --> 01:50:25.477]  Most of the people out there, especially that are in the mainstream media, they are purely turned over to the narcissism and are like biological androids.
[01:50:25.517 --> 01:50:26.637]  They're not even real.
[01:50:27.198 --> 01:50:32.982]  And I think that's why you freaked Brzezinski's daughter out and others so much, is because they
[01:50:33.542 --> 01:50:47.462]  Got into this conscious of the manipulation they were involved in, but really what you do to others comes back on you, so now they've turned into what they tried to do to the public, making the public one-dimensional cutouts of what they projected.
[01:50:47.783 --> 01:50:49.084]  It's now blown back on them.
[01:50:50.435 --> 01:50:51.136]  That's very interesting.
[01:50:51.356 --> 01:50:54.378]  I often wonder, Alex, how those situations are contrived.
[01:50:54.458 --> 01:51:03.425]  I suppose if you work in the media, you go through so many filters, you know, you're just not going to get that kind of job unless you're a certain type of person, unless you know the right sort of people.
[01:51:03.725 --> 01:51:06.487]  If you say the wrong type of things, you'll be filtered out.
[01:51:06.507 --> 01:51:17.095]  So by the time you get to the point where you have your own show, generally speaking, you think a certain way that is in alignment with the elitist interests that are behind whatever corporation owns the outlet.
[01:51:18.055 --> 01:51:38.084]  I think too that there is probably a less obvious way of understanding things in terms of, I wonder what happens neurologically, I wonder what the energy in a brain looks like, I wonder what that is like if our brains are surrounded by other brains that are thinking in a certain way, that are broadcasting, transmitting at a certain frequency.
[01:51:38.104 --> 01:51:41.446]  This is what I feel like we have is a situation where
[01:51:42.046 --> 01:51:48.608]  There's such a strong and hypnotic message that exists, not just externally, but more worrying internally.
[01:51:48.868 --> 01:51:57.970]  I'm always more worried when I find myself, that's why I don't like it when I've transgressed my own personal principles, because I think, well then, I'm not behaving in accordance with what I believe in.
[01:51:58.230 --> 01:51:59.570]  I'm policing myself.
[01:51:59.590 --> 01:52:02.331]  You know, if I'm selfish, then I'm part of the problem.
[01:52:02.771 --> 01:52:05.212]  You know, like Gandhi said, be the change you want to see in the world.
[01:52:06.212 --> 01:52:30.765]  From my own research, you're absolutely on target at the core here, that the establishment is expert at hijacking icons, or as Campbell wrote, archetypes, archetypal images, and then twisting them towards their aim, and then really rewriting all the basic cultural knowledge that every group out there had, and replacing it
[01:52:31.665 --> 01:52:35.507]  Basically, only with the New World Order's propaganda.
[01:52:35.807 --> 01:52:42.370]  I mean, nothing against basketball players or movie stars, but if that's what kids aspire to be, there's not many slots there.
[01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:51.054]  But by making those people the icons artificially, and making that the only thing that matters, then kids will never think about being a revolutionary.
[01:52:51.314 --> 01:52:54.656]  Or never think about standing up non-violently to oppression.
[01:52:54.976 --> 01:52:59.959]  Or never think about the fact that they could change the course and be an example to others.
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:08.645]  And so I really get from this that you're trying to almost go back and see what the people really stood for and try to get folks to become aware of this power?
[01:53:09.574 --> 01:53:10.576]  Yes, exactly Alex.
[01:53:10.896 --> 01:53:20.531]  I look at some corporate slogans like McDonald's, loving it, which is kind of meaningless and empty and an exploitation of an interesting piece of language to do with love.
[01:53:20.912 --> 01:53:24.718]  I look at Diet Dr Pepper and their slogan, unbelievably satisfying.
[01:53:24.738 --> 01:53:25.478]  We're good to go.
[01:53:52.549 --> 01:54:00.216]  Furthermore, the heroes I offer replaced gods, and gods themselves are symbols of certain traits and ideas.
[01:54:00.636 --> 01:54:05.920]  Indigenous faiths typically are pagan, which means they worship the earth and their environment.
[01:54:06.281 --> 01:54:13.847]  If you have a culture of people like the Celts that worship and revere rivers, how will you feel when corporations want to pollute your rivers?
[01:54:14.227 --> 01:54:19.572]  If you have an indigenous faith like the Nordics who revere the noble oak tree,
[01:54:19.872 --> 01:54:21.673]  How will you feel about deforestation?
[01:54:22.113 --> 01:54:32.239]  If you have people like the native people of this country that revere and worship the earth and soil, how will you feel when people say that fracking is a good idea and necessary?
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:39.324]  It means that we've lost our narrative that ties us to our actual reality, our authentic reality, as part of nature.
[01:54:39.644 --> 01:54:41.925]  Not living separate from nature, but part of nature.
[01:54:41.985 --> 01:54:42.786]  Sure, they get us.
[01:54:42.886 --> 01:54:46.168]  It's a narrative where we live in accordance with the East Indies.
[01:54:46.388 --> 01:54:57.130]  Wow, so they get us to sell out for light beer and blue jeans, as they say in a recent popular film, and then we're not satisfied by the light beer and blue jeans.
[01:54:57.150 --> 01:55:05.951]  Felicia, in closing, because this happens to me a lot every time I finish an interview, after it ends there's something or a group of things I wish that I would have said.
[01:55:06.031 --> 01:55:07.972]  Russell Brand, we really appreciate your time.
[01:55:08.352 --> 01:55:15.493]  In closing, in a minute or two, any other key points that you'd like to put out there to the millions that will end up watching and listening to this?
[01:55:16.829 --> 01:55:20.350]  Well, Alex, I think probably you and me are coming at things from a different perspective.
[01:55:20.630 --> 01:55:26.852]  Me, I see my views are more informed by socialism, even Marxism.
[01:55:26.872 --> 01:55:30.833]  But I think, ultimately, what we believe in is freedom and truth.
[01:55:31.093 --> 01:55:44.677]  And I think that as long as people respect each other's differences, and also acknowledge that we, the people struggling against oppression, have more in common with each other than we do than the people that control us, then I think there's a chance for unity and change.
[01:55:45.492 --> 01:56:07.687]  Sure, I mean, I think that at a level you can see as a counter to the centralized corporatist communism, socialism, but then you realize that they selectively use the deployment of collectivism to only create a permanent peasant class to control us, so that we never have come to the libertarian view of the individual being empowered and having a giant middle class.
[01:56:07.947 --> 01:56:10.469]  I mean, what's your view of, say, libertarianism or Ron Paul?
[01:56:10.709 --> 01:56:13.150]  I mean, off-air, you said that you were aware of my work.
[01:56:13.411 --> 01:56:15.232]  What's your view for folks of what I do?
[01:56:16.513 --> 01:56:21.855]  I think that you're fantastic because you're challenging authority and you're challenging status quo, so I agree with you.
[01:56:21.915 --> 01:56:29.079]  But for me, the number one priority for anyone who wants social change has to be the welfare of those most in need of it.
[01:56:29.539 --> 01:56:33.141]  The support of society's poorest and most vulnerable.
[01:56:33.961 --> 01:56:37.363]  And for me, that's not socialism.
[01:56:37.443 --> 01:56:39.964]  If anything, it's Christian, it's spiritual.
[01:56:40.124 --> 01:56:42.726]  That's what I believe is the most important issue.
[01:56:43.086 --> 01:56:50.470]  I think if you're in a position of power and your priority is not helping the poor and the dispossessed, then you shouldn't be in power.
[01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:58.313]  Now, of course, a healthy society across the board and hierarchies are always going to be, to a degree, necessary.
[01:56:58.734 --> 01:57:03.336]  But for me, on a deeper human level, I feel our obligation is to help those that are suffering
[01:57:03.596 --> 01:57:07.279]  Sure, you've got a giant Twitter account, what is it, Rusty Rockets.
[01:57:09.221 --> 01:57:14.726]  Is there any other places on the web people should visit other than that and your TV site?
[01:57:15.638 --> 01:57:17.199]  Nah, that's all cool for me, mate.
[01:57:18.020 --> 01:57:22.262]  I already follow you and stuff, but let's keep this dialogue going and I hope I see you in Austin.
[01:57:47.259 --> 01:57:54.184]  Well, that whilst Hitler's actions were deplorable, it's not his extremism that is terrifying, it's his mundanity.
[01:57:54.504 --> 01:58:02.950]  He was just a normal man created by a number of geopolitical, economic, and religious circumstances at the time.
[01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:11.194]  Yeah, of course Versailles and the anti-Semitism that was very prominent in that part of Europe at that time.
[01:58:12.574 --> 01:58:16.796]  But now, in those days, it was clear what evil was.
[01:58:16.876 --> 01:58:18.217]  Ah, evil is Adolf Hitler.
[01:58:18.477 --> 01:58:22.599]  Now evil comes dressed in the white of Ronald McDonald.
[01:58:22.659 --> 01:58:25.240]  Now evil is hidden behind the Apple logo.
[01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:30.262]  Now evil is indecipherable in derivative bundles and in dispossessed millions.
[01:58:31.963 --> 01:58:34.145]  It's about the narrative and the way we're told stories.
[01:58:34.605 --> 01:58:35.086]  Exactly.
[01:58:35.146 --> 01:58:40.450]  It knows how to hide and deciphering it, and knowing what evil is, is really the answer.
[01:58:40.710 --> 01:58:45.254]  Russell Brand, thank you so much, and I look forward to hopefully meeting you when you're in Austin in a few weeks.
[01:58:45.294 --> 01:58:46.455]  I'll be at your show regardless.
[01:58:46.475 --> 01:58:47.936]  Stay in touch, Alex.
[01:58:47.976 --> 01:58:48.797]  I can't wait to see you.

[01:59:29.864 --> 01:59:33.366]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:59:33.506 --> 01:59:37.468]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:59:37.788 --> 01:59:39.249]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:59:39.569 --> 01:59:47.153]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:59:47.433 --> 01:59:48.274]  But for how long?

[02:00:16.178 --> 02:00:16.798]  Big Brother.
[02:00:17.458 --> 02:00:18.499]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:19.239 --> 02:00:20.339]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:20.999 --> 02:00:21.799]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:23.460]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:27.741]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.321 --> 02:00:32.382]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.124 --> 02:00:38.967]  Alex Newman of the newamericanmagazine.com.
[02:00:38.987 --> 02:00:44.779]  I'm going to take a few final calls for you right now, but any other points you want to make about the U.N.
[02:00:44.899 --> 02:00:48.426]  treaty, a little Christmas gift that Obama says he'll implement by fiat.
[02:00:50.211 --> 02:00:56.856]  Yeah, one thing that I think is important for people to understand, the UN is more of a tool of the globalists than a danger in and of itself.
[02:00:57.217 --> 02:01:03.982]  But with that said, withdrawing from the United Nations and defunding the United Nations would set the globalists back decades.
[02:01:04.362 --> 02:01:09.446]  They're thinking to use the United Nations as the nucleus of this global tyranny that they're trying to impose.
[02:01:09.486 --> 02:01:10.367]  And they're doing it on all
[02:01:10.407 --> 02:01:10.887]  We're good to go.
[02:01:33.809 --> 02:01:42.915]  For all of us to aspire to, we need to educate our communities about the danger of the UN, and we can use that momentum to defund and then withdraw from the dictator's club.
[02:01:44.156 --> 02:01:45.236]  And that's what it is.
[02:01:45.877 --> 02:01:47.438]  That's what really exposes the UN.
[02:01:47.458 --> 02:01:49.419]  They never criticize dictators and horrible regimes.
[02:01:49.439 --> 02:01:53.522]  It's always Christians, family groups, private property.
[02:01:54.514 --> 02:02:01.585]  And then it's a bunch of corrupt billionaires on top of it, like George Soros, telling someone that makes $100,000 a year how they're a greedy pig.
[02:02:02.706 --> 02:02:05.491]  Leon in Utah, thanks for holding your own the year with Alex Newman.
[02:02:06.977 --> 02:02:07.918]  Hey, Alex.
[02:02:07.978 --> 02:02:12.620]  Hey, Mr. Newman and fellow patriotic citizens of the United States.
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:15.762]  I have a few things that I want to just point out real quick.
[02:02:15.962 --> 02:02:18.284]  I mean, what are we supposed to do, guys?
[02:02:18.584 --> 02:02:19.865]  What's the plan?
[02:02:19.905 --> 02:02:31.752]  I mean, overall, we can see that things are, you know, they're expanding in a way that's beyond our comprehension in terms of they want to just, you know, knock on our doors and say, hand over your guns, you know?
[02:02:32.212 --> 02:02:35.594]  We know that people are going to stand their grounds, and we know that
[02:02:35.974 --> 02:02:40.879]  You know, people are going to defend themselves, and it's going to be a bloodbath, to be honest with you.
[02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:49.567]  It's something that we all have to understand, and many people, I feel like they lack discipline because they don't listen.
[02:02:49.627 --> 02:02:52.390]  They're not aware of the things that are going on around us.
[02:02:52.450 --> 02:03:00.698]  I mean, just a couple of days ago, I guess, you know, Russia, or even today, they're threatening that, you know, they're saying that America's sounding off the drum for World War III.
[02:03:01.391 --> 02:03:05.394]  I mean, you can obviously tell that things are, they're not right here.
[02:03:05.874 --> 02:03:08.636]  And I mean, we know that violent protests take us nowhere.
[02:03:08.656 --> 02:03:13.839]  Um, and you know, they obviously don't agree with, uh, self protection.
[02:03:14.279 --> 02:03:16.200]  And, uh, so what, what, what's the plan?
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:23.525]  What do we, what kind of action are we supposed to take aside from petitioning and, you know, and, uh, you know, protests?
[02:03:23.625 --> 02:03:25.386]  What, what, what, what's the answer here?
[02:03:27.595 --> 02:03:28.516]  me what they can do.
[02:03:29.436 --> 02:03:31.798]  I always say, first of all, resist calls for violence.
[02:03:32.098 --> 02:03:36.660]  Most of the time, those are probably going to be coming from federal provocateurs and globalists anyways.
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:38.982]  Resist calls to this divide and conquer.
[02:03:39.002 --> 02:03:39.922]  It's not about race.
[02:03:39.982 --> 02:03:41.383]  It's not about class.
[02:03:41.443 --> 02:03:42.364]  It's not about any of these things.
[02:03:42.424 --> 02:03:48.507]  It's about globalist criminals versus the people of the United States, their liberties, and all that is right and good in the world.
[02:03:48.887 --> 02:03:51.649]  Now, in terms of what to do, we have a lot of tools available to us.
[02:03:51.709 --> 02:03:53.310]  One of the most important is educating our
[02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:54.011]  We're good to go.
[02:04:06.912 --> 02:04:07.732]  That's right.
[02:04:07.812 --> 02:04:17.777]  If the people become motivated and highly active and know what's happening, if all of you become media folks in your own area, or activists, or jury activists, whatever the case is, there's no way the globalists can be successful.
[02:04:17.817 --> 02:04:18.477]  If you just point people
[02:04:33.803 --> 02:04:40.827]  At New American Magazine, or Infowars.com, or WorldNetDaily.com, or PrisonPlanet.com, or DrudgeReport.com.
[02:04:41.087 --> 02:04:44.288]  Not that any of us are perfect, but we're promoting basic information.
[02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:52.813]  Thomas Jefferson said that if you've got an informed public, and you've got free information, and you've got good information, that tyranny will vanish like phantoms at dawn.
[02:04:53.573 --> 02:04:54.374]  That's what's happening.
[02:04:54.394 --> 02:04:55.695]  And we're starting to see a lot of victories.
[02:04:56.236 --> 02:04:58.158]  Congress has a 7% approval rating.
[02:04:58.518 --> 02:05:00.640]  We just have to go to the next level to hold their feet to the fire.
[02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:02.942]  Alex Newman, we'll watch this treaty closely.
[02:05:03.222 --> 02:05:04.003]  Thank you so much.
[02:05:04.564 --> 02:05:05.385]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[02:05:05.725 --> 02:05:06.065]  You bet.
[02:05:06.105 --> 02:05:08.788]  We'll be back with Gerald Cilente, the top trends forecaster.
[02:05:10.649 --> 02:05:16.033]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:17.293 --> 02:05:22.037]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:22.437 --> 02:05:29.221]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:31.163 --> 02:05:35.085]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:35.245 --> 02:05:37.187]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:05:49.311 --> 02:05:51.193]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:51.453 --> 02:05:52.974]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:05:53.234 --> 02:05:55.815]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:06:07.823 --> 02:06:08.624]  Others don't.
[02:06:10.129 --> 02:06:12.712]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[02:06:12.812 --> 02:06:13.974]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[02:06:14.234 --> 02:06:15.716]  Even with diet and exercise.
[02:06:15.916 --> 02:06:20.942]  Because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[02:06:21.082 --> 02:06:27.931]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[02:06:28.231 --> 02:06:30.212]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.
[02:06:30.472 --> 02:06:36.994]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[02:06:37.294 --> 02:06:43.196]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining three essential formulations.

[02:07:40.255 --> 02:07:44.296]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.

[02:08:06.161 --> 02:08:08.363]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:08:08.443 --> 02:08:09.264]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:35.683 --> 02:08:38.704]  Gerald Salente is going to be our guest for the balance of the hour.
[02:08:38.824 --> 02:08:40.885]  Always look forward to Gerald joining us.
[02:08:40.905 --> 02:08:44.346]  We'll be talking to him here in just one moment.
[02:08:45.166 --> 02:08:49.268]  Some of the stories online now at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:08:50.088 --> 02:08:52.069]  Christina Sarich has an article.
[02:08:52.589 --> 02:08:58.511]  Politicians silence nine-year-old over posting photos of school lunch.
[02:09:00.563 --> 02:09:04.604]  Do you want to know what some kids are being served at school every day?
[02:09:04.664 --> 02:09:06.845]  A classic example of tyranny.
[02:09:07.545 --> 02:09:18.288]  And it goes through the fact that the school says you're not allowed to take photos of the food that the school has, and you're going to get in trouble if you continue that.
[02:09:19.248 --> 02:09:20.668]  And that sounds like something innocuous.
[02:09:20.688 --> 02:09:21.109]  Who cares?
[02:09:21.149 --> 02:09:26.070]  Well, then they can feed them prison-style food if that's the case.
[02:09:27.665 --> 02:09:31.126]  And by the way, the photo of the hamburgers we have on there is not the school food.
[02:09:31.646 --> 02:09:35.767]  The school food looks like prisoner food when you go look at the photos.
[02:09:36.147 --> 02:09:41.428]  And it's reversing the Michelle Obama boondoggle all over the country that people can see the photos.
[02:09:41.728 --> 02:09:46.129]  So their answer is, don't make it high-quality food, or end federalization of the food.
[02:09:46.149 --> 02:09:47.929]  No!
[02:09:48.130 --> 02:09:49.510]  Just end free speech!
[02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:52.230]  Interesting article, The Forecaster.
[02:09:52.611 --> 02:09:54.112]  Can this computer predict the future?
[02:09:54.132 --> 02:09:55.413]  The government certainly thinks so.
[02:09:55.953 --> 02:09:58.055]  Articles at Infowars.com.
[02:09:58.075 --> 02:10:04.440]  And it goes over the fact that the Feds seized
[02:10:05.603 --> 02:10:14.994]  After 10 years of economic forecaster Martin Armstrong sat in federal prison, they seized a computer system he came up that they believe has an algorithm that can predict the future.
[02:10:15.335 --> 02:10:19.059]  Folks, Google can predict the future now with mass movements.
[02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:21.302]  Facebook can predict it.
[02:10:21.322 --> 02:10:21.842]  You get enough...
[02:10:22.654 --> 02:10:24.475]  You know, tens of millions of people simultaneously.
[02:10:24.875 --> 02:10:27.937]  It gives you, in mass movements, true predictability.
[02:10:28.177 --> 02:10:34.061]  How do you think Amazon can individually know what you're going to order now before you order and have it being packaged before you even buy it?
[02:10:34.841 --> 02:10:44.967]  Or now pizza huts are coming out with iPads in the wall that face scan your retina as you look at the menu and then it decides and tells you what you wanted to order.
[02:10:46.553 --> 02:10:50.136]  Just like Google gives you predictive searches tailored to what you want.
[02:10:50.597 --> 02:10:55.801]  This is how they're going to manipulate society and then actually start telling you you want something when you don't.
[02:10:56.101 --> 02:10:57.383]  Talk about laziness.
[02:10:57.983 --> 02:10:59.424]  Talk about mind control.
[02:10:59.905 --> 02:11:01.967]  Those articles are up at InfoWars.com.
[02:11:02.547 --> 02:11:13.237]  Another story that I want to get Gerald Cilente's take on first, then the economy, Russia, the world, and his top trends for 2015 that he's going to preview here for us with his Trends Journal today.
[02:11:14.838 --> 02:11:19.041]  Zuckerberg lauds socialism with China's internet censorship czar.
[02:11:19.161 --> 02:11:22.003]  Facebook CEO visit with Liu Wei.
[02:11:22.463 --> 02:11:23.864]  Hypocritical and absurd.
[02:11:26.145 --> 02:11:32.409]  Now this is a guy praising them when they literally have people arrested and executed for using the internet improperly, they claim.
[02:11:32.769 --> 02:11:36.432]  And now they're trying to learn, Obama's been meeting with them, how to do this here.
[02:11:37.984 --> 02:11:49.376]  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, that calls his users dumb effers for trusting him, lauded the virtues of socialism during a recent meeting with Liu Wei, the czar of China's draconian internet censorship system.
[02:11:49.797 --> 02:11:52.480]  We can scroll down and show you a nice picture of him as Mao Zedong.
[02:11:52.940 --> 02:11:55.143]  Having previously met with a State Department official...
[02:11:56.653 --> 02:12:11.330]  Katharina Novelli, who urged the two countries to work together as friends on web security, that means ending free speech, we paid a visit to Facebook's Silicon Valley offices despite the fact that the social networking website is completely banned in China.
[02:12:11.850 --> 02:12:16.415]  During the meeting, we discovered a book written by Chinese President Xi Jinping
[02:12:17.176 --> 02:12:28.486]  Called the governance of China sitting on Zuckerberg's office desk, leading Zuckerberg to comment, I bought this book for my co-workers, I want them to understand socialism with Chinese characteristics, and went on to praise it.
[02:12:28.986 --> 02:12:29.747]  Truly sickening.
[02:12:29.767 --> 02:12:31.608]  Let me give you the Chinese characteristic of that.
[02:12:32.449 --> 02:12:34.070]  Most generals there are billionaires.
[02:12:35.652 --> 02:12:42.678]  And there's no social network when people chain their kids up, their toddlers up, and they go work in the slave factories building robots that are now going to replace them.
[02:12:43.871 --> 02:12:50.418]  Here's the headline, National Review, China's Promises to End Harvesting the Executed.
[02:12:51.059 --> 02:13:00.209]  I remember about 10 years ago the State Department came out and said it was a rumor, even though the Communist Chinese advertise in trade publications that they have, quote, fresh organs.
[02:13:01.598 --> 02:13:13.822]  Whatever you need, and they keep the Falun Gong peaceful practitioners that are healthy, genetically and blood tested, in prison cells, waiting for when Richie Rich wants to show up and get the goodies.
[02:13:15.263 --> 02:13:17.303]  You don't hear the trendies complaining about that.
[02:13:17.903 --> 02:13:25.006]  See, when there's pressure on the organ harvesting, just come out and call it a conspiracy theory, even though the BBC now has this headline.
[02:13:26.368 --> 02:13:31.030]  China has promised to stop harvesting organs from executed prisoners by January 1st, state media reports.
[02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:34.911]  Death row inmates have long served as a key source of transplants.
[02:13:35.311 --> 02:13:36.232]  Here's the promise.
[02:13:36.752 --> 02:13:37.692]  But it's not the first.
[02:13:39.193 --> 02:13:40.233]  They've done it many times.
[02:13:41.554 --> 02:13:46.196]  We take you now to Kingston, New York, site of the start of the American Revolution.
[02:13:46.716 --> 02:13:49.057]  And Gerald Solente joining us via video Skype.
[02:13:49.847 --> 02:13:51.108]  Gerald, thanks for coming on.
[02:13:51.128 --> 02:13:52.828]  We're going to cover the waterfront today.
[02:13:52.848 --> 02:13:59.111]  I want to get into a whole bunch of stuff, but what do you make of this hypocrisy and Zuckerberg calling people dumb-efforts?
[02:13:59.131 --> 02:14:02.712]  What do you make of Gruber admitting Obamacare is a giant screwjob?
[02:14:02.752 --> 02:14:06.534]  I mean, you've worked as a consultant, as a lobbyist, as a Fortune 500 guy.
[02:14:07.214 --> 02:14:09.135]  Why are these people so arrogant?
[02:14:09.415 --> 02:14:12.936]  You always speak to the White Shoe Boys and the Harvard Mafia.
[02:14:12.976 --> 02:14:14.157]  Well, that's where he's from.
[02:14:14.737 --> 02:14:19.241]  And now he's over at MIT producing lies to fool the American people.
[02:14:19.602 --> 02:14:20.843]  Why would he brag?
[02:14:21.103 --> 02:14:22.564]  Why would Zuckerberg brag?
[02:14:22.845 --> 02:14:23.906]  What's their problem?
[02:14:24.726 --> 02:14:29.911]  Well, why are sociopaths sociopaths and psychopaths psychopaths?
[02:14:30.512 --> 02:14:36.677]  And going back to Zuckerberg talking about socialism in China, could anyone say communism?
[02:14:37.728 --> 02:14:38.809]  That's what it is.
[02:14:39.429 --> 02:14:42.271]  And remember who sold us out and when.
[02:14:42.291 --> 02:14:44.773]  It began with Bill Clinton.
[02:14:45.193 --> 02:14:56.041]  And as I keep thinking about this, and I keep thinking about that little grubby Gruber talking about how stupid we are and how they could pull things over our eyes.
[02:14:56.802 --> 02:14:57.603]  Also, Alex,
[02:14:58.323 --> 02:15:05.286]  I used to run political campaigns in Westchester County at a graduate school back in the early 1970s.
[02:15:05.787 --> 02:15:09.748]  And I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate.
[02:15:10.269 --> 02:15:11.389]  So I was right there.
[02:15:11.829 --> 02:15:23.515]  I was sitting in the back of the chamber with Malcolm Wilson, who was the governor, my boss Al Abrams, nice guy, and the head of the Republican Party, Anderson.
[02:15:24.296 --> 02:15:25.139]  John Anderson.
[02:15:25.159 --> 02:15:26.182]  So I was right there.
[02:15:26.203 --> 02:15:27.748]  I saw what it looked like.
[02:15:27.788 --> 02:15:28.471]  I know the game.
[02:15:28.511 --> 02:15:29.695]  I know the way it's run.
[02:15:30.718 --> 02:15:42.123]  And what's going on is the system is being run by lowlifes, who are, to me, nothing more than traitors to America.
[02:15:42.623 --> 02:15:44.143]  They are all traitors.
[02:15:44.524 --> 02:15:59.730]  Slick Willie Clinton, a traitor for selling us out to the Chinese with NAFTA, for selling us out with the other traitor, Robert Rubin, who deregulated the Glass-Steagall Act that allowed the banks to steal all our dough.
[02:16:00.985 --> 02:16:09.173]  Traders, this guy Gruber, you could keep going after one after another and go back again to Zuckerberg talking about China.
[02:16:09.853 --> 02:16:13.737]  Let's go back to two weeks after 9-11.
[02:16:14.698 --> 02:16:18.021]  Go look at what oil prices were back then.
[02:16:18.501 --> 02:16:19.923]  Eh, they were in the $20 a barrel range.
[02:16:22.188 --> 02:16:32.033]  And then when everybody wasn't looking, and the CIA liars, and I love the words that they use, the prestitute language.
[02:16:32.073 --> 02:16:38.856]  Remember, Alex, we always have to be proper, because people don't like it when you're not proper.
[02:16:39.317 --> 02:16:43.059]  So we have to say, the CIA misled.
[02:16:43.759 --> 02:16:44.519]  Misled?
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:46.180]  Grow up, Junior.
[02:16:46.500 --> 02:16:47.341]  They're liars.
[02:16:47.621 --> 02:16:49.662]  They lied us into the Afghan war.
[02:16:49.902 --> 02:16:51.043]  They lied us into
[02:16:52.130 --> 02:16:53.372]  The Iraq War.
[02:16:53.392 --> 02:16:57.357]  You remember those weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al-Qaeda.
[02:16:57.618 --> 02:17:02.124]  You remember that next mushroom cloud you see.
[02:17:02.484 --> 02:17:04.006]  Condoleezza Rice.
[02:17:04.026 --> 02:17:04.507]  Yeah.
[02:17:04.988 --> 02:17:06.229]  One liar after another.
[02:17:06.249 --> 02:17:07.050]  Now let's go back.
[02:17:07.671 --> 02:17:10.732]  Two weeks after 9-11, fup, zap!
[02:17:11.172 --> 02:17:12.692]  Hey, Zuckerberg!
[02:17:13.152 --> 02:17:13.752]  China!
[02:17:14.072 --> 02:17:18.753]  They brought it into the World Trade Organization when no one was looking.
[02:17:19.413 --> 02:17:22.494]  And then you saw the increase in oil prices.
[02:17:22.974 --> 02:17:25.874]  You saw the phony boom start being built.
[02:17:26.374 --> 02:17:28.155]  They sold us out.
[02:17:28.615 --> 02:17:35.036]  Clinton, Bush, Obama, Pelosi, Reid, McConnell, Graham,
[02:17:35.596 --> 02:17:44.524]  One after another, they are traitors to the Constitution, traitors to the Bill of Rights, traitors to America.
[02:17:45.045 --> 02:17:56.776]  All of these people are traitors and they should be brought up on more criminal charges and treason against we the people and everything that we stand for.
[02:17:58.072 --> 02:17:59.232]  I agree.
[02:17:59.532 --> 02:18:18.297]  Do you agree with me that clearly they're trying to start racial division and play the people off against the police, when the police are obviously even federalized, a lot of bad stuff there, but the politicians want to get us all fighting with each other instead of realizing they're the enemy and this is all a desperate tactic promoting all of this division.
[02:18:19.177 --> 02:18:22.438]  Go back to our SpringTrends Journal.
[02:18:23.098 --> 02:18:25.339]  Went out three weeks before Ferguson.
[02:18:26.826 --> 02:18:31.888]  The article that we asked Dr. Paul Craig Roberts to write was, Cops Gone Wild.
[02:18:32.688 --> 02:18:35.089]  How the police have gone wild in this country.
[02:18:35.569 --> 02:18:37.550]  It's more than a racial issue.
[02:18:37.890 --> 02:18:48.654]  It's an issue against we the people that the traitors that have destroyed our Constitution and Bill of Rights with the so-called Patriot Act.
[02:18:48.934 --> 02:18:56.987]  With a National Defense Authorization Act, have robbed us of our rights and militarized our nation, particularly after 9-11.
[02:18:58.283 --> 02:18:58.843]  Racial?
[02:18:59.084 --> 02:19:00.725]  Hey, a racist nation?
[02:19:00.825 --> 02:19:02.306]  Are there racists in America?
[02:19:02.887 --> 02:19:04.027]  Of course there are.
[02:19:04.308 --> 02:19:06.809]  Hey, I'm an Italian-American.
[02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:08.851]  You want to see discrimination?
[02:19:08.871 --> 02:19:13.114]  Hey, put on a show like The Sopranos with the Jewish people.
[02:19:13.174 --> 02:19:14.715]  Yeah, do one like that.
[02:19:14.835 --> 02:19:16.216]  Try it with the blacks.
[02:19:16.517 --> 02:19:18.158]  Hey, how about with the Spanish?
[02:19:18.398 --> 02:19:20.420]  Yeah, Rodriguez and Jose.
[02:19:20.700 --> 02:19:22.301]  Yeah, doing dirty deals.
[02:19:22.701 --> 02:19:23.882]  Try that one out.
[02:19:24.222 --> 02:19:25.163]  Are there racists?
[02:19:25.343 --> 02:19:26.084]  Are there bigots?
[02:19:26.304 --> 02:19:27.325]  Of course there are.
[02:19:27.705 --> 02:19:29.565]  Is America a racist nation?
[02:19:30.066 --> 02:19:30.386]  No.
[02:19:30.846 --> 02:19:35.027]  If we were a racist nation, Alex, would we have a black president?
[02:19:35.347 --> 02:19:37.927]  Hey, how about that attorney general?
[02:19:38.287 --> 02:19:39.668]  What color is he?
[02:19:40.328 --> 02:19:42.448]  I forgot about Condoleezza Rice.
[02:19:42.468 --> 02:19:43.188]  Remember her?
[02:19:43.529 --> 02:19:44.969]  What about Colin Powell?
[02:19:45.229 --> 02:19:47.990]  Hey, who's that Homeland Security Johnson what?
[02:19:48.330 --> 02:19:49.550]  What color is your skin?
[02:19:50.470 --> 02:19:51.691]  I've had enough of it!
[02:19:52.011 --> 02:19:55.492]  Hey, who's the woman running national security?
[02:19:56.072 --> 02:19:57.433]  Oh, Susan Rice?
[02:19:57.753 --> 02:19:58.613]  Yeah, Rice?
[02:19:58.913 --> 02:20:00.474]  White as Rice?
[02:20:00.934 --> 02:20:01.494]  No!
[02:20:02.135 --> 02:20:03.435]  Stay there, Gerald Cilente.
[02:20:03.455 --> 02:20:04.956]  We'll give his website out when we come back.

[02:21:09.301 --> 02:21:11.824]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[02:21:11.945 --> 02:21:13.086]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[02:21:13.346 --> 02:21:14.828]  Even with diet and exercise.
[02:21:15.028 --> 02:21:20.075]  Because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[02:21:20.235 --> 02:21:27.044]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[02:21:27.344 --> 02:21:29.327]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.
[02:21:29.587 --> 02:21:36.155]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.

[02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:16.722]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:24:16.762 --> 02:24:22.530]  Gerald Cilente from TrendsResearch.com and the Trends Journal riding shotgun with us.
[02:24:23.351 --> 02:24:25.794]  And we're not being negative here, bringing up the bad things.
[02:24:26.716 --> 02:24:29.659]  The system always says, oh, don't get angry, don't be negative.
[02:24:30.612 --> 02:24:33.896]  There's so much good stuff in the world that that's why I'm angry and upset.
[02:24:34.016 --> 02:24:34.837]  I want to defend it.
[02:24:35.498 --> 02:24:36.459]  I don't want to be a slave.
[02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:40.865]  But you really can't doubt the fact that tyranny is moving on all fronts.
[02:24:40.965 --> 02:24:42.847]  I've criticized the militarization of police.
[02:24:43.548 --> 02:24:45.150]  I've exposed it, probably like nobody else.
[02:24:45.771 --> 02:25:01.765]  But then I can see the Feds trying to come in and make every evil in the world about the police when it's worldwide, the federalization, the globalization, the militarization has been happening as criminal ruling classes move from free market to crony systems.
[02:25:02.185 --> 02:25:08.671]  Gerald Cilente, I want to start getting into the top trends of 2015, your new journal that's just about to come out, that's just invaluable reading.
[02:25:08.691 --> 02:25:13.355]  I hope everybody goes to TrendsResearch.com and subscribes or at least signs up for your free alerts.
[02:25:14.873 --> 02:25:19.218]  And looks at the 2015 forecast, you're going to give us a first look here today.
[02:25:19.638 --> 02:25:24.203]  But in this short segment, what do you think the state of the world itself is?
[02:25:24.283 --> 02:25:28.508]  Obama says that he stabilized the world and that it's never been more secure.
[02:25:29.069 --> 02:25:32.152]  Hegel said the world's never been more insecure, so he fired him.
[02:25:33.113 --> 02:25:35.496]  What is the real state of the world overall in your view?
[02:25:36.596 --> 02:25:38.017]  We're heading toward World War.
[02:25:38.097 --> 02:25:39.998]  It's blowing out all over the place.
[02:25:40.058 --> 02:25:45.822]  Anybody that's half-awake and is listening to and watching what's going on can see it.
[02:25:46.422 --> 02:25:51.825]  And I want to stay on this China issue again with Zuckerberg sucking up over there.
[02:25:52.066 --> 02:25:54.307]  Zuckerberg, maybe, would be more appropriate.
[02:25:54.327 --> 02:25:55.027]  Yeah, Zuckerberg.
[02:25:55.768 --> 02:25:57.209]  Commie Zuckerberg.
[02:25:57.249 --> 02:25:57.969]  There we go.
[02:25:58.269 --> 02:26:01.291]  And you look what's going on here and around the world.
[02:26:01.832 --> 02:26:04.033]  You go back to one of our top trends for 2014.
[02:26:05.854 --> 02:26:06.934]  China boomtown.
[02:26:07.895 --> 02:26:11.276]  America's in the business of war, China's in the business of business.
[02:26:11.696 --> 02:26:12.856]  They're buying up the world.
[02:26:13.296 --> 02:26:14.617]  And they're buying up America.
[02:26:14.897 --> 02:26:16.357]  Hey, folks, you like that?
[02:26:16.858 --> 02:26:18.618]  Obama always calls everybody folks.
[02:26:18.758 --> 02:26:19.779]  Yeah, folks.
[02:26:20.239 --> 02:26:22.600]  Folks, you like that Smithfield pork?
[02:26:23.300 --> 02:26:25.000]  Hey, owned by China, huh?
[02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:25.901]  Oh, yeah.
[02:26:26.261 --> 02:26:30.242]  Hey, how about that Waldorf Astoria in New York?
[02:26:30.562 --> 02:26:32.883]  Hey, Chinese just bought it for two billion, didn't they?
[02:26:33.303 --> 02:26:34.464]  Oh, where are they getting the dough?
[02:26:35.145 --> 02:26:35.585]  Ah, yes.
[02:26:36.225 --> 02:26:38.287]  Just did another deal right here in New York.
[02:26:38.547 --> 02:26:38.667]  Ah!
[02:26:39.288 --> 02:26:40.829]  Only about a billion dollars.
[02:26:41.490 --> 02:26:42.270]  Who's funding it?
[02:26:43.011 --> 02:26:45.193]  The Chinese National, or the Chinese Bank?
[02:26:45.533 --> 02:26:46.534]  Communist government!
[02:26:47.386 --> 02:26:49.908]  You go look what's going on over there in Portugal.
[02:26:50.469 --> 02:27:02.559]  You know, they're privatizing everything, privatizing... And my problem, I mean, I don't want to get into what real privatization is, but the Communist Chinese already every month I see where they're controlling TV shows, movies, what can be published.
[02:27:03.540 --> 02:27:05.842]  Michael Savage couldn't even get his book promoted anywhere.
[02:27:06.202 --> 02:27:12.788]  The publisher wouldn't promote it because the Chinese threatened him because he criticized... I mean, the Communist China is a big fat censor.
[02:27:12.848 --> 02:27:13.629]  That's my problem.
[02:27:14.309 --> 02:27:16.811]  Well, again, they're communists.
[02:27:17.351 --> 02:27:20.353]  I mean, I grew up most of my life teaching us to hate communists.
[02:27:20.753 --> 02:27:22.615]  Hey, those Russians, they're no good!
[02:27:22.955 --> 02:27:24.736]  But those Chinese commies?
[02:27:25.136 --> 02:27:26.137]  Our kind of guys.
[02:27:26.417 --> 02:27:27.398]  Gee, I wonder why.
[02:27:28.098 --> 02:27:38.726]  Couldn't be because of all of the American manufacturers that sold us out and brought all their cheap, uh, their product over there to be made by slave labor.
[02:27:39.026 --> 02:27:41.948]  So the Chinese communists are good commies.
[02:27:42.288 --> 02:27:44.470]  Oh, those Cubans, they're bad commies too.
[02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:47.212]  There's only good commies and bad commies.
[02:27:47.613 --> 02:27:49.694]  It's all about business, Alex.
[02:27:50.175 --> 02:27:51.816]  And that's what I want to talk about.
[02:27:51.836 --> 02:27:57.301]  The business of business is China, and China's buying up the world.
[02:27:57.801 --> 02:27:59.263]  And you look at the numbers.
[02:27:59.743 --> 02:28:02.886]  As I said, privatization going on all throughout Europe.
[02:28:03.206 --> 02:28:04.608]  It's not privatization.
[02:28:05.008 --> 02:28:12.016]  It's selling off valuable public assets at bargain basement prices to do dirty deals with your pals.
[02:28:12.897 --> 02:28:15.079]  They just had a big auction in Portugal.
[02:28:15.379 --> 02:28:17.982]  You know what the major language was of the people bidding?
[02:28:18.423 --> 02:28:19.063]  Mandarin.
[02:28:19.784 --> 02:28:21.566]  You look what's going on in Canada.
[02:28:21.786 --> 02:28:23.949]  Look what's going on in the United States.
[02:28:24.269 --> 02:28:26.131]  The Chinese economy's collapsed.
[02:28:26.432 --> 02:28:28.174]  The smart money over there knows it.
[02:28:28.554 --> 02:28:33.460]  They have 70 million, that's right, million vacant luxury apartments.
[02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:35.762]  Entire cities that are vacant.
[02:28:36.443 --> 02:28:37.684]  Their bubble has burst.
[02:28:37.984 --> 02:28:42.627]  Look, they lowered interest rates 40 basis points trying to pump this thing up.
[02:28:42.988 --> 02:28:44.349]  Goes back to the trends of 2015.
[02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:47.491]  One of them is called price wars.
[02:28:47.891 --> 02:28:48.251]  Why?
[02:28:48.711 --> 02:28:53.875]  Because there's oversupply and overcapacity of just about everything.
[02:28:54.135 --> 02:29:01.120]  It's not only oil prices that are going down because of oversupply and less demand.
[02:29:01.620 --> 02:29:02.901]  It's copper prices.
[02:29:02.981 --> 02:29:04.002]  It's corn prices.
[02:29:05.783 --> 02:29:06.304]  Iron ore?
[02:29:07.085 --> 02:29:09.768]  You could buy rebar, reinforcement rod.
[02:29:10.148 --> 02:29:15.795]  A ton of reinforcement rod over in China costs less than a ton of cabbage.
[02:29:16.255 --> 02:29:21.622]  So what they're doing, they are aware of the collapse that's coming.
[02:29:22.082 --> 02:29:25.324]  They're taking their money and they're buying up the world.
[02:29:25.544 --> 02:29:37.892]  You better learn how to speak Chinese and learn how to be a better commie because the politicians in this nation have sold us out and continue to do so.
[02:29:37.952 --> 02:29:38.932]  And they love it.
[02:29:39.053 --> 02:29:39.793]  It's like Gruber.
[02:29:40.213 --> 02:29:45.817]  It's one thing to raise rates and rip off poor people and cut their health care, but he enjoys it.
[02:29:46.537 --> 02:29:50.819]  He enjoys lying, enjoys cheating, enjoys screwing people over.
[02:29:51.139 --> 02:29:54.221]  A bunch of low-life, degenerate, filthy scum.
[02:29:54.461 --> 02:29:55.521]  But we let him do it.
[02:29:56.101 --> 02:29:56.902]  So it's our fault.
[02:29:57.062 --> 02:29:58.362]  Because we're a bunch of chumps.
[02:29:59.243 --> 02:30:00.163]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.664 --> 02:30:02.264]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.185 --> 02:30:05.866]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.998 --> 02:30:12.581]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[02:30:12.681 --> 02:30:13.822]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[02:30:14.102 --> 02:30:15.563]  Even with diet and exercise.
[02:30:15.764 --> 02:30:20.828]  Because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[02:30:20.968 --> 02:30:27.795]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[02:30:28.095 --> 02:30:30.078]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.
[02:30:30.338 --> 02:30:36.867]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[02:30:37.168 --> 02:30:43.076]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining three essential formulations.
[02:30:43.556 --> 02:30:51.303]  Oxygen-Based Cleanser Oxy Powder, The Secret 12 Bioavailable Vitamin B12, and your choice of Super Female or Super Male Vitality.
[02:30:51.463 --> 02:30:58.070]  Now all available at a discounted price to you and your family to bring in the new year and make 2015 a true success.
[02:30:58.430 --> 02:30:59.591]  That's Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:30:59.611 --> 02:31:02.734]  2015 is the year to do it and it all starts at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:16.784]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.
[02:31:17.004 --> 02:31:26.369]  At InfoWars Life, our mission is to bring you the highest quality, purest, cleanest, effective colloidal silver on the market today for the lowest price available.
[02:31:26.609 --> 02:31:34.593]  You don't have to be a doctor to know the fall and winter months are the most dangerous time of year in North America when it comes to you and your family's health.
[02:31:34.893 --> 02:31:44.316]  Infowarslife.com is very excited to announce our biggest run yet of silver bullet colloidal silver exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.

[02:32:09.614 --> 02:32:16.678]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:32:16.778 --> 02:32:18.940]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:32:19.140 --> 02:32:24.243]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:32:24.423 --> 02:32:29.446]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:32:29.586 --> 02:32:32.588]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:32:32.888 --> 02:32:36.753]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:32:36.973 --> 02:32:41.218]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:32:41.298 --> 02:32:51.369]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:32:51.529 --> 02:32:54.052]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs.
[02:32:55.093 --> 02:33:02.303]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:33:02.443 --> 02:33:06.408]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:33:11.656 --> 02:33:12.236]  We've got it.
[02:33:12.277 --> 02:33:18.742]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:33:18.802 --> 02:33:22.544]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:23.165 --> 02:33:28.829]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:35.829 --> 02:33:39.772]  My friends, I want to thank you all for this Christmas coming up.
[02:33:40.213 --> 02:33:42.034]  For your support of the broadcast.
[02:33:42.755 --> 02:33:44.996]  I am very humbled by the millions of listeners we have.
[02:33:45.016 --> 02:33:47.538]  I'm very humbled by the fact that you put up with me.
[02:33:48.279 --> 02:33:51.702]  Because regardless of how I deliver information, some of it good, some of it bad.
[02:33:53.655 --> 02:34:01.581]  We are trying to tell the truth and trying to promote liberty and freedom, and to try to build a platform for other great folks to promote their platforms, because we're all in this together.
[02:34:02.121 --> 02:34:07.766]  So this Christmas, please think about InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsShop.com, same URL.
[02:34:09.417 --> 02:34:10.357]  To do your Christmas shopping.
[02:34:10.798 --> 02:34:35.607]  As long as you order by the 17th, whether it's a Molon Labe camo, long-sleeve, Made in America shirt, or whether it's a come-and-take-it, pro-Second Amendment, short-leaf shirt in men's or women's, whether it's high-quality supplements at Infowarslife.com, whether it's a commemorative Molon Labe silver coin, only 500, we've already sold out of one-fifth of them since I launched it yesterday, or Molon Labe belt buckles, it's all available
[02:34:36.107 --> 02:34:40.810]  At InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:34:42.371 --> 02:34:46.614]  And OxyPowder, developed by Dr. Groove, is revolutionary.
[02:34:46.974 --> 02:34:51.477]  Time-released oxygen in the intestines to flush out and detox like nothing else.
[02:34:51.777 --> 02:34:54.779]  Rob Do in one week lost 18 pounds of stuff that was in there.
[02:34:55.099 --> 02:34:57.100]  The average person has more than 20.
[02:34:58.841 --> 02:35:00.843]  And this is something that is so affordable.
[02:35:01.263 --> 02:35:05.006]  On average, you've got about three detoxes or enough to do three weeks of this.
[02:35:05.486 --> 02:35:06.607]  So every few months you can do it.
[02:35:06.627 --> 02:35:13.132]  That's three, four months supply in one bottle of Oxy Powder.
[02:35:13.613 --> 02:35:17.435]  And we've got it available and discounted at Infowarslife.com.
[02:35:18.236 --> 02:35:20.818]  We did sell out of several of the nutraceuticals.
[02:35:22.299 --> 02:35:26.361]  Like the Secret 12, but we have a limited supply.
[02:35:26.441 --> 02:35:29.002]  We hope coming in very, very soon.
[02:35:29.022 --> 02:35:31.182]  We have more of the Occupower back in.
[02:35:31.503 --> 02:35:42.207]  These really are revolutionary products where we go out and find the most powerful missing links out there, like iodine deficiency and people aren't getting the right type of bioavailable iodine.
[02:35:42.507 --> 02:35:51.250]  We have the True Nation Iodine, Deep Earth Crystal Source and Survival Shield, X2 and Classic Survival Shield, all available and a lot of specials running.
[02:35:51.650 --> 02:35:51.991]  That's right.
[02:36:10.194 --> 02:36:10.975]  I don't lionize Russia.
[02:36:27.605 --> 02:36:30.447]  But as you know, they're really trying to destabilize it.
[02:36:30.467 --> 02:36:31.847]  They're trying to cut off their pipelines.
[02:36:31.867 --> 02:36:33.068]  They're trying to screw up their deals.
[02:36:34.069 --> 02:36:39.512]  They're lowering oil prices to try to bankrupt them so that then there'll be no competition.
[02:36:39.552 --> 02:36:41.513]  They can jack it up as high as they want, in my view.
[02:36:41.533 --> 02:36:48.877]  And a lot of mainline analysts, not just you or Dr. Paul Craig Roberts or myself, are saying this could lead to actual war.
[02:36:50.675 --> 02:37:02.533]  Is there no amount of hubris out of these Harvard Mafia people that though they act like miscreant weasels are in control of the nuclear arsenal?
[02:37:05.114 --> 02:37:10.657]  Well, they, again, you know, we're looking at who they are, and everything they do, they turn to disaster.
[02:37:11.037 --> 02:37:16.360]  There's not one thing that anybody could point to that says, look at the great job that the D.C.
[02:37:16.420 --> 02:37:26.246]  gang has done, whether it's in health care, whether it's in education, whether it's in military, whether it's in the environment.
[02:37:26.866 --> 02:37:29.970]  Whether it's in food safety, go up and down the list.
[02:37:30.631 --> 02:37:43.108]  And before I go on, I want to also encourage all the listeners of InfoWars to support what you're doing, as you know that we do, and we advertise in InfoWars Magazine.
[02:37:43.669 --> 02:37:48.632]  Because you're one of the few people out there, along with a number of us, that are concerned with the truth.
[02:37:48.692 --> 02:37:50.933]  And the truth isn't abstract.
[02:37:51.393 --> 02:37:53.894]  I'll give you an example why it's not abstract.
[02:37:54.295 --> 02:37:59.998]  Begins with our conversation today about the CIA, quote, misleading.
[02:38:00.318 --> 02:38:01.778]  It's not misleading, it's lying.
[02:38:01.798 --> 02:38:03.079]  There's a lie and a truth.
[02:38:03.679 --> 02:38:05.921]  It's not about banks misleading.
[02:38:06.941 --> 02:38:09.622]  Or misdeeds.
[02:38:10.183 --> 02:38:12.844]  It's about corruption and thievery.
[02:38:13.264 --> 02:38:14.525]  So there is a truth.
[02:38:15.085 --> 02:38:21.328]  And when enough people support the truth, then the truth, as they say, shall make us free.
[02:38:21.968 --> 02:38:29.912]  So I really encourage everyone during this holiday season to do what they can to keep promoting your voice of freedom.
[02:38:30.892 --> 02:38:34.534]  And as we look at the whole situation of what's devolving,
[02:38:35.327 --> 02:38:42.889]  And the bigger picture, the bigger picture is that we see in 2015, is this is the year of the game changer.
[02:38:43.589 --> 02:38:46.330]  Look what's going on in the markets as we're speaking.
[02:38:47.190 --> 02:38:50.511]  All of a sudden, the markets are now under pressure.
[02:38:51.251 --> 02:38:53.412]  The Shanghai Index today lost over 5%.
[02:38:53.632 --> 02:38:57.253]  It's down over 2% across Europe.
[02:38:58.047 --> 02:39:03.930]  Again, what's going on in oil, yes, it's an oversupply issue, but it's a lack of demand issue.
[02:39:04.390 --> 02:39:14.115]  Because when you go through all of the commodities, again, whether it's corn, whether it's iron ore, whether it's copper, you're looking at five-year loads.
[02:39:14.575 --> 02:39:16.796]  You're looking at a global slowdown.
[02:39:17.496 --> 02:39:24.300]  And the way they get your mind off the global slowdown is with war and going back to Russia.
[02:39:25.441 --> 02:39:27.603]  How they've taught us how to hate Russia.
[02:39:28.163 --> 02:39:30.245]  And you well know we were on top of this.
[02:39:30.625 --> 02:39:33.327]  We saw it coming with the Sochi Olympics.
[02:39:34.308 --> 02:39:37.751]  Again, prior to the destabilization of the Ukraine.
[02:39:37.771 --> 02:39:39.232]  Hey, Alex!
[02:39:39.752 --> 02:39:41.053]  Don't go to Sochi!
[02:39:41.454 --> 02:39:47.018]  Because if you get on one of those airplanes, watch out for those toothpaste bombs!
[02:39:47.598 --> 02:39:49.019]  Who can make this stuff up?
[02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:50.341]  I'll tell you who!
[02:39:50.961 --> 02:39:53.163]  A bunch of sick SOBs!
[02:39:53.563 --> 02:39:54.224]  Hey, Alex!
[02:39:54.884 --> 02:39:56.686]  Don't go to Sochi!
[02:39:57.106 --> 02:39:58.648]  Not if you like animals!
[02:39:59.029 --> 02:40:01.792]  Because they're shooting all those stray dogs!
[02:40:02.172 --> 02:40:03.634]  And don't drink the water!
[02:40:04.094 --> 02:40:06.236]  No, no, no, it's all yellow!
[02:40:06.717 --> 02:40:07.338]  Yeah!
[02:40:07.878 --> 02:40:10.681]  And hey, those hotel rooms, they're garbage!
[02:40:11.862 --> 02:40:16.987]  They started to defame Russia before it happened.
[02:40:17.307 --> 02:40:26.315]  By the time the Olympics began, America's perception of Russia was at a 1994 low.
[02:40:26.836 --> 02:40:28.738]  I'll tell everyone out there listening.
[02:40:29.338 --> 02:40:31.259]  You want to get into a good business?
[02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:38.164]  You can do it cheaply, doesn't have to make any sense, and you can make a lot of dough doing it.
[02:40:38.744 --> 02:40:39.785]  Propaganda!
[02:40:40.145 --> 02:40:41.986]  That's the business to get into.
[02:40:42.426 --> 02:40:44.087]  Watch out for those ISIS!
[02:40:44.808 --> 02:40:46.429]  Fear and hysteria.
[02:40:47.109 --> 02:40:50.311]  All of the propaganda coming out against Russia.
[02:40:51.072 --> 02:40:52.733]  Let's put this into perspective.
[02:40:53.273 --> 02:40:54.133]  Every week,
[02:40:55.214 --> 02:41:08.612]  If not, every day we keep hearing about Russian troop movements, Russian tanks, Russian armoured vehicles flooding over the Russian border into Ukraine.
[02:41:08.933 --> 02:41:11.597]  Hey Alex, have you seen any pictures yet?
[02:41:15.145 --> 02:41:16.227]  They show us nothing.
[02:41:16.708 --> 02:41:18.391]  Hey, this world is selfies?
[02:41:19.132 --> 02:41:21.016]  You can't show us one photo?
[02:41:21.376 --> 02:41:22.538]  No, I'll tell you why.
[02:41:22.999 --> 02:41:24.442]  Because they're liars.
[02:41:24.863 --> 02:41:26.165]  They're sociopaths.
[02:41:27.096 --> 02:41:29.157]  They are leading us to war.
[02:41:29.877 --> 02:41:32.598]  The global economy is collapsing.
[02:41:33.358 --> 02:41:48.902]  Only a psychopath would want to put sanctions on Russia that only hurts really the Europeans, because we don't do that much business with them, at a time when the European economy is in the crapper.
[02:41:49.223 --> 02:41:49.903]  Oh, that's right!
[02:41:50.783 --> 02:41:52.264]  Unemployment in Italy?
[02:41:52.284 --> 02:41:52.364]  Yeah.
[02:41:53.845 --> 02:41:55.346]  It's at record lows.
[02:41:55.567 --> 02:41:56.007]  Yeah, over 13%.
[02:41:58.754 --> 02:42:03.738]  Oh, look what happened today in the Greek stock market.
[02:42:04.038 --> 02:42:14.446]  Now you turn on CBS, Bloomberg, you see the little prostitutes come out there and say, there's recovery over there in Greece.
[02:42:14.726 --> 02:42:16.408]  They're out of a recession.
[02:42:16.948 --> 02:42:19.170]  Gee, wonder why the market's down 11% today.
[02:42:22.256 --> 02:42:33.583]  So you can see, only a moron, a psychopath, and a sociopath would put sanctions on Russia, now that Russians are putting sanctions on the Europeans.
[02:42:33.903 --> 02:42:34.964]  And who is it hurting?
[02:42:35.324 --> 02:42:37.806]  Well, it's hurting the small people in Europe.
[02:42:38.226 --> 02:42:41.588]  Yeah, the ones that used to sell product to Russia.
[02:42:42.069 --> 02:42:44.950]  So they're destroying the global economy.
[02:42:45.591 --> 02:42:50.414]  And when I said before, Alex, this isn't a throwaway line.
[02:42:51.667 --> 02:43:04.694]  That Obama, who's launched a war against Syria, that's dropping bombs on a sovereign nation, and you remember the line about that humanitarian mission?
[02:43:04.914 --> 02:43:06.695]  No, we're not going back in Iraq!
[02:43:07.196 --> 02:43:08.036]  No, no, no!
[02:43:08.476 --> 02:43:15.300]  We're there on a humanitarian mission to save those Christians on the mountain, and then the Yazidis.
[02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:16.901]  You know what a Yazidi is!
[02:43:17.241 --> 02:43:19.723]  I'm sure you got them all over San Antonio!
[02:43:20.183 --> 02:43:21.845]  We gotta save them, too!
[02:43:22.686 --> 02:43:23.026]  No, no!
[02:43:23.407 --> 02:43:26.650]  It's not all those bombing runs they're doing every day.
[02:43:27.071 --> 02:43:28.473]  And who's he doing it with?
[02:43:28.913 --> 02:43:30.455]  Doesn't even ask Congress.
[02:43:30.795 --> 02:43:32.517]  Congress doesn't even care.
[02:43:32.878 --> 02:43:34.099]  They're traitors!
[02:43:35.060 --> 02:43:37.200]  These people are committing treason.
[02:43:37.621 --> 02:43:42.121]  They're treasonous acts, and no one wants to call it what it is.
[02:43:42.462 --> 02:43:44.562]  They're treasonous acts of war.
[02:43:44.982 --> 02:43:56.504]  They're treasonous acts that are robbing us of our constitutional rights, of our Bill of Rights, and our money, because they make up things.
[02:43:56.704 --> 02:43:58.985]  One of the top trends... Oh, by the way,
[02:43:59.585 --> 02:44:10.381]  We have decided, we selected the people for InfoWars to hear our list of top 10 trends, of top trends for 2015 before anyone else.
[02:44:11.022 --> 02:44:14.928]  They just went out to our subscribers as we're talking.
[02:44:15.729 --> 02:44:20.192]  We also had a conference here in Colonial Kingston this last Saturday.
[02:44:20.212 --> 02:44:25.995]  A video of that is also available, a five-hour conference we put on.
[02:44:26.435 --> 02:44:30.738]  And people, if they go to our website, they can sign up to get that as well.
[02:44:31.038 --> 02:44:43.505]  But we selected InfoWars because these are the people of all of the media that's putting out to the people freedom of speech, thought, and spirit.
[02:44:44.045 --> 02:44:46.467]  No one is doing it to the level that you are.
[02:44:47.007 --> 02:44:50.490]  So we decided this is the one we're going to first.
[02:44:51.350 --> 02:44:54.653]  And going back to the top trends, bankism.
[02:44:55.765 --> 02:44:58.748]  People are saying this is a failure of capitalism.
[02:44:58.828 --> 02:44:59.409]  No, it's not.
[02:44:59.689 --> 02:45:00.630]  It's bankism.
[02:45:00.971 --> 02:45:02.633]  The banks are in control.
[02:45:02.953 --> 02:45:14.506]  And the person that's writing this story for us in the Trends Journal, and we have the synopsis out now, is Nomi Prins, who of course wrote that great book, All the President's Bankers.
[02:45:15.066 --> 02:45:17.687]  So, don't complain about capitalism.
[02:45:18.027 --> 02:45:19.367]  Four words killed it.
[02:45:19.748 --> 02:45:21.208]  Everybody knows what they are.
[02:45:21.528 --> 02:45:22.889]  Too big to fail.
[02:45:23.169 --> 02:45:33.292]  Brought to you by Henry Paulson, former CEO of the Goldman Sachs gang, now playing big roles as Frankenstein in a freak show near you!
[02:45:33.912 --> 02:45:34.992]  What else do we have?
[02:45:35.012 --> 02:45:35.813]  Hey!
[02:45:36.713 --> 02:45:38.374]  The grand manipulation.
[02:45:38.974 --> 02:45:40.795]  It is no free markets.
[02:45:41.315 --> 02:45:42.576]  Everything is rigged.
[02:45:42.936 --> 02:45:44.676]  We know LIBOR is rigged.
[02:45:44.937 --> 02:45:47.278]  Eh, only to 700 trillion dollars.
[02:45:47.578 --> 02:45:49.138]  That's right, the interest rates.
[02:45:49.418 --> 02:45:51.659]  But, we're not gonna punish anybody!
[02:45:51.679 --> 02:45:52.320]  No, no, no!
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:55.901]  They're just misdeeds, and they misled.
[02:45:56.321 --> 02:46:06.566]  So we'll only fine them, and the same thing with the Forex, the currency exchange of which they trade $5.3 trillion a day.
[02:46:07.187 --> 02:46:14.750]  On and on, gold manipulation as detailed and written in this issue by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:46:15.431 --> 02:46:17.952]  Other big trend, price wards.
[02:46:18.991 --> 02:46:20.093]  Get ready for it.
[02:46:20.573 --> 02:46:21.535]  Here's something.
[02:46:21.595 --> 02:46:23.397]  This is going to go out later.
[02:46:23.838 --> 02:46:26.301]  We just started writing about it today.
[02:46:26.842 --> 02:46:28.084]  This is a headline.
[02:46:28.985 --> 02:46:34.213]  If these equity markets continue to go in the direction that they are,
[02:46:35.862 --> 02:46:43.367]  This is gonna be a rocket that's gonna knock Santa out of the sky, and the retail sales are gonna plummet.
[02:46:43.948 --> 02:46:47.010]  Look what already happened with Black Friday.
[02:46:47.330 --> 02:46:49.151]  Came in on the red, didn't it?
[02:46:49.491 --> 02:46:55.335]  No, it didn't go up 4.1%, as the National Retail Federation had predicted.
[02:46:55.876 --> 02:46:56.276]  Down 11%.
[02:46:58.017 --> 02:47:02.780]  Now you pile on that declining markets, fear,
[02:47:03.821 --> 02:47:18.037]  Fear spreading across the world of the overblown equity markets that were only propped up because of low interest rates and trillions of dollars of phony money flooding in.
[02:47:18.677 --> 02:47:25.265]  You're going to see a disastrous Christmas, which brings us to the trend price wars.
[02:47:26.104 --> 02:47:26.784]  You're going to see 50%, 75%.
[02:47:27.144 --> 02:47:40.446]  They're going to want to unload the garbage that they have, made in China, at any price they could get, rather than being caught with oversupply of product.
[02:47:40.686 --> 02:47:48.688]  You look at the sales, even at the luxury end, prod is getting blown away, one after another.
[02:47:49.288 --> 02:47:53.869]  So when you start putting these trends together, how do they get your mind off it?
[02:47:54.069 --> 02:47:54.869]  I'll tell you how.
[02:47:55.529 --> 02:47:57.851]  You saw what they did with ISIS, remember?
[02:47:58.232 --> 02:48:00.153]  They beheaded those guys.
[02:48:00.714 --> 02:48:02.395]  Ooh, beheadings are bad.
[02:48:02.876 --> 02:48:04.077]  Drones away?
[02:48:04.497 --> 02:48:05.438]  Ah, that's okay.
[02:48:05.718 --> 02:48:07.980]  That's a clean blowout, man.
[02:48:08.721 --> 02:48:09.242]  Bombs?
[02:48:09.722 --> 02:48:10.283]  Fine.
[02:48:10.503 --> 02:48:13.045]  But no beheadings, and the people buy it.
[02:48:13.365 --> 02:48:14.947]  They buy it like they buy 32-ounce
[02:48:17.344 --> 02:48:19.166]  Phosphorescent slurpees!
[02:48:19.446 --> 02:48:20.907]  You could sell them anything!
[02:48:21.488 --> 02:48:29.015]  So when you start putting the trends together, and keep looking where it's going, you go back into the positive ones, like you said.
[02:48:30.136 --> 02:48:31.597]  The millennial generation.
[02:48:32.979 --> 02:48:36.882]  They are going to be ripe for retrograde.
[02:48:37.839 --> 02:48:52.496]  This is the only generation coming up where they're looking, and those of us that are old enough, remember that all our lives the polls used to show the future is going to be greater than the present.
[02:48:53.217 --> 02:48:54.017]  Not anymore!
[02:48:54.637 --> 02:48:59.319]  Now they look at the future and they say, Marone, it's bad now, it's only going to get worse.
[02:48:59.899 --> 02:49:04.861]  They're looking for a future that they're going to take from the past.
[02:49:04.941 --> 02:49:10.162]  Remember, the Renaissance in Italy happened after the Black Plague.
[02:49:11.483 --> 02:49:14.284]  Sixty percent of Europeans were killed.
[02:49:14.544 --> 02:49:15.244]  They were dead.
[02:49:15.644 --> 02:49:18.285]  They realized, what are we doing wrong?
[02:49:18.985 --> 02:49:20.926]  So they went back to the past.
[02:49:21.286 --> 02:49:24.627]  A renaissance, a rebirth, a rediscovery.
[02:49:25.067 --> 02:49:26.148]  Retrograde.
[02:49:26.548 --> 02:49:30.589]  They're going to take from the past and retrofit it for the future.
[02:49:31.050 --> 02:49:35.051]  This is one of the biggest trends that people should look into.
[02:49:35.591 --> 02:49:39.873]  Because the millennial generation, they're not stupid.
[02:49:40.173 --> 02:49:42.234]  A lot of these kids are really sharp.
[02:49:42.774 --> 02:49:44.496]  And they know they're getting shafted.
[02:49:44.816 --> 02:49:51.403]  And they can see who the shafter is, and they know they're getting it on the blunt end.
[02:49:52.184 --> 02:49:55.807]  So, manufacturers, it ties into local.
[02:49:56.248 --> 02:49:57.969]  It ties into high quality.
[02:49:58.390 --> 02:50:04.196]  You will finding out our research at music schools, these kids aren't going back to rock and roll.
[02:50:04.724 --> 02:50:06.686]  They're not going back to Louis Armstrong.
[02:50:06.966 --> 02:50:08.928]  They're not going back to Ella Fitzgerald.
[02:50:09.288 --> 02:50:11.070]  They're going back to Bessie Smith.
[02:50:11.630 --> 02:50:13.892]  They're going back to Django Reinhardt.
[02:50:14.593 --> 02:50:15.173]  Beyond.
[02:50:15.534 --> 02:50:18.216]  They're going back to Jelly Roll Morton.
[02:50:18.637 --> 02:50:20.758]  They're going back to the roots.
[02:50:21.299 --> 02:50:25.563]  The roots of America that made this country what it was.
[02:50:26.023 --> 02:50:29.606]  Anybody can complain and I don't want to hear the stories.
[02:50:29.626 --> 02:50:31.008]  I'm very aware of them.
[02:50:31.755 --> 02:50:34.037]  What we did to the genocide of the Indians.
[02:50:34.498 --> 02:50:36.960]  The inequality that we did to blacks.
[02:50:37.400 --> 02:50:38.822]  I'm very familiar with it.
[02:50:39.753 --> 02:50:43.636]  But this was also the land of opportunity.
[02:50:44.196 --> 02:50:45.517]  I make this very clear.
[02:50:45.837 --> 02:50:46.538]  Gerald, stay there.
[02:50:46.598 --> 02:50:48.019]  Explain this when we come back.
[02:50:48.039 --> 02:50:51.861]  And we're going to look at some of the other trends with Gerald Cilente straight ahead.
[02:50:51.921 --> 02:50:54.623]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, InfoWars.com.
[02:50:55.123 --> 02:50:56.584]  Check out and get the new magazine.

[02:51:09.073 --> 02:51:09.593]  Stay with us.
[02:51:09.973 --> 02:51:13.615]  We all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means.
[02:51:13.956 --> 02:51:19.179]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[02:51:19.479 --> 02:51:21.801]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[02:51:24.685 --> 02:51:28.607]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[02:51:28.967 --> 02:51:30.548]  Do you even have a plan B?
[02:51:31.068 --> 02:51:34.129]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[02:51:34.369 --> 02:51:35.590]  Children left with no home.
[02:51:35.610 --> 02:51:36.950]  And no one's coming to help them.
[02:51:37.451 --> 02:51:40.292]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[02:51:40.492 --> 02:51:42.693]  Is a visit to mypatriotsupply.com.
[02:51:42.893 --> 02:51:50.535]  There you'll find the absolute best prices on storable foods, non-GMO seeds, emergency water filtration devices, and so much more.

[02:52:05.841 --> 02:52:09.102]  Remember, before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[02:52:09.542 --> 02:52:10.543]  The experts are clear.
[02:52:10.863 --> 02:52:17.808]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:52:17.968 --> 02:52:24.232]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[02:52:24.252 --> 02:52:27.835]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:52:27.955 --> 02:52:31.857]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:52:32.177 --> 02:52:37.220]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:52:37.500 --> 02:52:38.401]  Not our iodine.
[02:52:38.501 --> 02:52:44.664]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:53:39.187 --> 02:53:43.030]  The CDC just announced flu vaccines may have the wrong strain of flu virus.
[02:53:43.270 --> 02:53:44.411]  You may not be protected.
[02:53:44.651 --> 02:53:49.035]  Whatever your lifestyle, your immune system is critical and Imudine provides your immune support.

[02:53:57.601 --> 02:54:01.224]  Remember, Imudine is key support for your immune system.
[02:54:25.532 --> 02:54:33.235]  I think what Gerald's getting at, as the break cut him off, Alex Jones here back live, is that you have to look at the time we lived in, 250 years ago.
[02:54:33.775 --> 02:54:41.138]  We're only taught about America's evils, but when compared to other countries, it was very tame, in some cases.
[02:54:41.198 --> 02:54:42.399]  In some, it was very barbarous.
[02:54:42.779 --> 02:54:54.284]  But the idea of not having a big government, not having royalty that's being bowed to in the White House today, the idea of the little people having ideas and quality
[02:54:55.509 --> 02:55:09.072]  And I'm already seeing this renaissance as liberal trendies that move to Austin are not just going out and learning how to square dance, and I'm not saying that's even good, but it's good to see them trying to do something folky or authentic.
[02:55:09.812 --> 02:55:11.052]  They're going out and buying guns.
[02:55:11.112 --> 02:55:12.833]  They're going out and buying four-wheel drive trucks.
[02:55:13.873 --> 02:55:17.974]  They are breaking with the system and becoming more libertarian, more rugged.
[02:55:19.435 --> 02:55:25.098]  And unfortunately, original Texans are sitting in their trailer houses watching satellite TV all day and dying of heart attacks.
[02:55:25.138 --> 02:55:27.800]  But I think that's what Gerald's trying to get at.
[02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:28.981]  People going to truck farms.
[02:55:29.001 --> 02:55:30.362]  People going to organic farms.
[02:55:31.022 --> 02:55:33.784]  People getting into going to thrift stores to get their clothes.
[02:55:34.324 --> 02:55:39.167]  Half the time it's better than a big... And I'm not saying big corporate stores are the devil in every case.
[02:55:39.847 --> 02:55:43.629]  But they're all lobbying to get laws passed where you can't have a farmer's market.
[02:55:44.069 --> 02:55:53.533]  So if we shop, just like the organic food market that didn't exist 20 years ago, and demand it, it will grow, it will lower the price, it will supplant the rest of the economy.
[02:55:54.554 --> 02:56:02.818]  And so there is a major quest now by young people, I'd say 30 and below, to look for something better.
[02:56:02.858 --> 02:56:03.998]  Is that what you're getting at, Gerald?
[02:56:04.458 --> 02:56:05.939]  Yes, that's exactly it.
[02:56:06.119 --> 02:56:07.520]  And again, going back,
[02:56:08.160 --> 02:56:08.980]  Quality.
[02:56:09.401 --> 02:56:12.982]  Look at the buildings they used to build, look at the jump they put up now.
[02:56:13.382 --> 02:56:17.764]  A big box store, it's like going shopping in a large self-storage unit.
[02:56:17.864 --> 02:56:18.225]  Yes.
[02:56:18.945 --> 02:56:25.028]  So it's, they're looking for quality, because they know that quality is going to improve their lives.
[02:56:25.448 --> 02:56:31.931]  Beauty and quality are going to be big sellers, the marketers that understand it... Rediscovering that beauty is wealth.
[02:56:32.947 --> 02:56:33.627]  Exactly.
[02:56:34.408 --> 02:56:36.148]  Again, that was the Renaissance.
[02:56:36.748 --> 02:56:37.729]  And look what's happened.
[02:56:38.149 --> 02:56:42.450]  And again, as I was saying before, you know, people could criticize this country.
[02:56:42.790 --> 02:56:45.331]  We were the envy of the world.
[02:56:45.491 --> 02:56:47.412]  It was the land of opportunity.
[02:56:47.772 --> 02:56:51.933]  As I say, my blood is Italian, but my heart is American.
[02:56:52.374 --> 02:56:54.934]  I could never be me if I was born anywhere else.
[02:56:55.535 --> 02:56:59.056]  The freedom that I was given, that they're taking away now.
[02:56:59.776 --> 02:57:02.946]  So going on to some other trends and it all ties together.
[02:57:04.485 --> 02:57:10.229]  The golden age, the boomers are now, you know, I'm born in 1946.
[02:57:10.810 --> 02:57:13.051]  This is one of the biggest markets to play at.
[02:57:13.351 --> 02:57:17.694]  You were talking about all the people sitting around watching stupid television.
[02:57:18.455 --> 02:57:22.037]  Going for the gold is going to go for the golden age.
[02:57:22.597 --> 02:57:25.379]  In exercises, no, not these muscle trips.
[02:57:25.839 --> 02:57:28.021]  How do you stay healthy and live longer?
[02:57:28.321 --> 02:57:32.424]  You go to our website, we did a video on June and Stanley Blum.
[02:57:33.024 --> 02:57:34.626]  They're 95 years old!
[02:57:35.347 --> 02:57:37.409]  Stanley began painting at 80!
[02:57:39.013 --> 02:57:45.056]  When you... in other... in other... That's how you stay alive, is learning and doing new things.
[02:57:45.776 --> 02:57:46.437]  Exactly.
[02:57:46.937 --> 02:58:03.725]  And the marketers that understand that, in providing them products and services, and I'm not talking about walkers and canes... No, treating old people like they're still people, and then they'll act like people and won't decide to go die, because all the studies show, when old people feel like they're outneeded by the tribe, they go turn off and die.
[02:58:04.065 --> 02:58:13.514]  When they're treated like elders and respected and brought in, they become the dynamic engine that then interlocks down to the first generation below them and then that down to the young people.
[02:58:13.534 --> 02:58:18.459]  And that's why they've targeted the youth and told them to be forever kids when they're supposed to be men and women earlier.
[02:58:18.479 --> 02:58:21.462]  That's why they told old people, oh, it's your time to go to the beach.
[02:58:21.782 --> 02:58:24.504]  And then they go and just die instead of staying alive.
[02:58:25.450 --> 02:58:26.391]  Perfectly said.
[02:58:27.071 --> 02:58:31.274]  And so the older you get, if you keep on learning, the wiser you get.
[02:58:31.534 --> 02:58:34.517]  I remember when I was a little kid, my father made us all rest in peace.
[02:58:34.957 --> 02:58:39.520]  Meeting dinner, he'd look at me and say, you know, son, they say youth is wasted on the young.
[02:58:40.021 --> 02:58:44.544]  Take a couple more bites and he'd say, they were talking about you.
[02:58:44.584 --> 02:58:45.765]  Do five more with us, Cheryl.
[02:58:45.785 --> 02:58:47.246]  Some overdrive to put bookends on it.
