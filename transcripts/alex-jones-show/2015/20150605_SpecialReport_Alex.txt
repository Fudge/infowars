[00:00:09.727 --> 00:00:10.908]  Jakari Jackson here.
[00:00:10.948 --> 00:00:17.916]  We have a new article on the site, Natural Food Victory Pizza Hut Taco Bell to eliminate artificial ingredients.
[00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:19.277]  And this is a great deal indeed.
[00:00:19.657 --> 00:00:26.705]  We've seen several restaurants following suit because people have concerns that they actually want real food in their food.
[00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:33.193]  And the article points out how some of these restaurants use things like black pepper flavoring instead of actual black pepper.
[00:00:33.614 --> 00:00:38.760]  So as we move more towards natural food, I definitely think it's good to see all the activists out there.
[00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:41.023]  One of the big ones you guys know is the food babe.
[00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:44.468]  Vani Hari has been attacked viciously.
[00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.545]  They just attack her, say she's a junk scientist.
[00:00:47.846 --> 00:00:51.087]  As far as I know, she's never claimed to be a scientist in general.
[00:00:51.147 --> 00:00:53.449]  She's just a researcher who does her own stuff.
[00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:59.212]  And regardless of what her science may be or may not be, she's trying to make your food better.
[00:00:59.332 --> 00:01:08.216]  And even these companies recognize that they have things in their products that isn't the healthiest choice for its customers, especially people who eat this stuff over a long period of time.
[00:01:08.657 --> 00:01:13.199]  Case in point, you guys may recall the girl who had a diet of McDonald's
[00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:30.417]  Chicken nuggets and after eating these things for several years became pretty ill and couldn't figure out why fast food chains like Chipotle also Chick-fil-a as well as others Subway a big one that Miss Hari was going after trying to talk about the ingredients in their bread.
[00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:35.563]  They have changed the ingredients they had a type of chemical in there that made the bread more flexible and
[00:01:35.803 --> 00:01:36.604]  She said, take that out.
[00:01:36.644 --> 00:01:37.805]  They said, OK, we'll do our best.
[00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:41.449]  And I do believe they're planning to take that out sooner than later.
[00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:47.715]  So just examples of just people who start off small, you can continue to grow and actually have a voice.
[00:01:47.735 --> 00:01:50.037]  You just don't have to be somebody who sits on the sideline.
[00:01:50.338 --> 00:01:52.660]  You can actually get into the arena and make a change.
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.763]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
