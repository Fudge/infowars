[00:00:15.956 --> 00:00:16.577]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.257 --> 00:00:18.278]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:20.119]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.600]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:23.242]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:27.505]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.106 --> 00:00:32.209]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:36.552]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:36.632 --> 00:00:40.495]  I'm David Knight, and joining us now is Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:41.256]  Alex?
[00:00:43.024 --> 00:00:49.113]  Of course, folks, David, thank you, David, is going to be hot showing the operation today for the next three hours.
[00:00:49.193 --> 00:00:53.058]  Then, of course, in the fourth hour, we have one of the other great crew members taking over.
[00:00:53.098 --> 00:00:54.581]  Now we've expanded to the fourth hour.
[00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:56.944]  Then, of course, there's the nightly news, seven o'clock central.
[00:00:56.984 --> 00:00:58.947]  I'm joining you via audio Skype.
[00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:02.830]  From the mountains in South Texas.
[00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.850]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.971]  But we are down here.
[00:01:05.872 --> 00:01:14.900]  Let's just say investigating things slash also getting some R&R because all work and no play makes Alex Jones completely insane and not just a dull boy.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.563]  But we are here investigating a whole bunch of different stuff.
[00:01:18.603 --> 00:01:22.326]  But as I sit here, it's a little cafe off the side of the highway.
[00:01:22.964 --> 00:01:27.886]  I noticed they've got a couple fake owls sitting out to keep birds from coming and roosting.
[00:01:28.327 --> 00:01:33.349]  That's kind of what the Second Amendment is for criminals and bad people in government is it's a warning.
[00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.652]  We have teeth, you know, we have beaks, we have claws, we have talons.
[00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:43.254]  We're not prey animals to be fed on.
[00:01:43.294 --> 00:01:45.275]  So that's kind of how my brain works without allegory.
[00:01:46.036 --> 00:01:49.737]  A couple days ago we were just going to do a shoot in front of Google's.
[00:01:49.777 --> 00:01:50.878]  We were downtown and I thought
[00:01:52.093 --> 00:01:58.315]  This is their headquarters of their rollout in Austin for fiber and a bunch of other stuff and they always claim they're open to the public.
[00:01:58.955 --> 00:02:00.155]  Let's go walk in with a camera.
[00:02:00.895 --> 00:02:05.536]  And the people there doing an event that also the Google people freaked out and said, get out and call the police on us.
[00:02:07.217 --> 00:02:14.379]  And we just did this to illustrate that Google's surveilling everyone, but that we're not supposed to surveil them openly and publicly.
[00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:19.880]  And this one event obviously won't save the world, but it just puts
[00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:24.755]  A spotlight back on Google and Big Brother and what's happening.
[00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:30.240]  I mean, Google drives around with its cars, taking photos of your house, grabbing your passcodes, breaking into what you're doing.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.662]  And then if you supposedly criticize it.
[00:02:33.468 --> 00:02:34.769]  Uh, you know, you're a horrible person.
[00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.291]  So Anthony Guiciardi is coming up in the next segment, uh, to kind of talk a little bit about it with David Knight.
[00:02:39.311 --> 00:02:43.192]  Then at the bottom of the hour, he's going to be back with David and we're going to air that piece.
[00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:48.695]  The video simultaneously of your radio listener will go up on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:52.237]  But that said, uh, David, I know you're going to be covering a lot of news today.
[00:02:52.697 --> 00:02:58.859]  There's a lot of really important articles that are key to all this on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.101]  Uh, here's one of them by,
[00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.683]  Steve Watson, I think, should be red-linked.
[00:03:05.203 --> 00:03:06.824]  I think we should do a nightly news report on this.
[00:03:06.844 --> 00:03:08.344]  We should make a big focus on this.
[00:03:08.764 --> 00:03:12.846]  It's like Drudge focused on pointing out that government has bodyguards, but we don't.
[00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:18.928]  I mean, everybody already knows that, but we really pushed that as a meme, and now we've got people in presidential debates bringing it up.
[00:03:18.988 --> 00:03:20.468]  We've got articles every day about it.
[00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:27.411]  It's really a meme that's gaining a lot of steam, gaining a lot of power.
[00:03:28.103 --> 00:03:31.367]  We have, you know, James Woods calling for Obama to give up the Secret Service.
[00:03:31.787 --> 00:03:41.759]  I mean, it really is a crescendo of us collectively showing our power and beating a drum harmonically until it brings down the house.
[00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:42.560]  And here's another example.
[00:03:43.461 --> 00:03:44.843]  Iceland is the answer for the world.
[00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:54.206]  They were told they owed something like $85-90 billion if you go back to the time six years ago during the banker bailout at the end of 2008 globally.
[00:03:54.686 --> 00:03:59.429]  They just arrested their finance ministers, got all the documents, and found that they owed about $4 billion or less.
[00:04:00.832 --> 00:04:04.134]  In fact, some estimates were less than a billion, but the point is they debated a billion.
[00:04:04.174 --> 00:04:05.074]  Four billion was the max.
[00:04:06.475 --> 00:04:07.936]  Some estimates were as low as 800 million.
[00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:09.357]  The point is 800 million to four billion.
[00:04:09.837 --> 00:04:17.021]  They've paid back several billion of it now with interest, and they've now arrested 26 corrupt bankers that were involved in the scam.
[00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:24.285]  It turns out the head finance minister had signed the government on to big British, Swiss, and U.S.
[00:04:24.325 --> 00:04:26.026]  banks' debt that wasn't theirs.
[00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:26.806]  And why is that important?
[00:04:27.306 --> 00:04:28.407]  It's the exact same model.
[00:04:28.971 --> 00:04:39.701]  Here in the United States, in Greece, in Spain, in Portugal, in Italy, where the number is normally above 90% of the debt that we're signed on to is not ours.
[00:04:40.501 --> 00:04:42.864]  Just like we have 19 trillion of debt that's U.S.
[00:04:42.924 --> 00:04:48.088]  debt, but even signed on to way more other international obligations and things that aren't our debts.
[00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:52.172]  And then the bankers that basically honcho all this, they're able to get full control
[00:04:52.856 --> 00:04:57.481]  Uh, over society, so there is that extremely important article up on InfoWars.com.
[00:04:57.742 --> 00:05:02.887]  David, take us out, and I'm gonna come back and hit a few other articles, but there's a lot of positive things happening right now.
[00:05:02.907 --> 00:05:04.609]  All right, we're gonna be right back.
[00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:05.931]  I'm David Knight here in studio.
[00:05:05.991 --> 00:05:07.853]  Alex Jones is gonna be with us when we return.
[00:05:08.113 --> 00:05:08.554]  Stay with us.

[00:06:09.986 --> 00:06:13.208]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[00:06:13.488 --> 00:06:18.771]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:26.976]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:06:27.436 --> 00:06:33.139]  Sourced from top-leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:42.243]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:06:42.664 --> 00:06:48.547]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:06:48.887 --> 00:06:55.170]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.773]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:07:01.013 --> 00:07:03.194]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:03.474 --> 00:07:05.495]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:07:09.847 --> 00:07:10.408]  I want more candy!
[00:07:10.568 --> 00:07:11.529]  I want more video games!
[00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:11.709]  Mine!
[00:07:11.769 --> 00:07:11.949]  Mine!
[00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:12.270]  Mine!
[00:07:13.091 --> 00:07:22.501]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:07:22.841 --> 00:07:25.384]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:07:25.544 --> 00:07:28.888]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:07:29.088 --> 00:07:31.831]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system.
[00:07:31.991 --> 00:07:32.752]  We're good to go.
[00:07:54.648 --> 00:08:01.935]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:05.658]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:08:21.289 --> 00:08:24.271]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:24.851 --> 00:08:29.074]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:30.595 --> 00:08:34.337]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, October 23rd, 2015.
[00:08:34.457 --> 00:08:35.598]  I'm David Knight.
[00:08:36.118 --> 00:08:38.380]  Joining me in studio is Anthony Gucciardi.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:43.023]  And also joining us outside the studio is Alex Jones.
[00:08:43.143 --> 00:08:43.283]  Alex?
[00:08:44.676 --> 00:08:45.457]  That's right, gentlemen.
[00:08:45.477 --> 00:08:48.759]  I'm going to hand the baton over to you gentlemen in just a minute or two.
[00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:57.286]  And then, of course, we have this Google report coming up that is somewhat entertaining, also informative, but really holds the seed in it.
[00:08:57.941 --> 00:09:12.309]  To the takedown of the globalists, if we physically begin to take action in even peaceful ways, putting our bodies against the gears of Big Brother, Big Brother will grind in the mud like so many other tyrannies of the past.
[00:09:12.409 --> 00:09:22.334]  First, I want to give people some of the bad news today, and then obviously you're going to get into the Benghazi hearings yesterday, you're going to get into the economic news, you're going to get into just a huge amount of stuff here today.
[00:09:23.775 --> 00:09:26.836]  Here's why they're trying to censor our free speech, because it is effective.
[00:09:26.876 --> 00:09:29.037]  Two articles on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:29.057 --> 00:09:29.878]  This is the good news.
[00:09:30.758 --> 00:09:31.519]  This is the bad news.
[00:09:31.579 --> 00:09:34.420]  Arizona high school bans patriotic gear from football game.
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.421]  Can't have American flags, things like that.
[00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:37.942]  It's seen as hurtful, seen as racist.
[00:09:38.602 --> 00:09:42.424]  Yesterday we have major groups, student groups, calling for getting rid of Thomas Jefferson statues.
[00:09:43.164 --> 00:09:45.885]  This, this is the cultural Marxism that we face.
[00:09:45.925 --> 00:09:49.567]  Then another article here, and this already happens with iPhones,
[00:09:50.677 --> 00:09:54.698]  Where if you try to type words that are politically incorrect into it, it basically won't let you type it.
[00:09:54.938 --> 00:09:56.319]  That's been going on for a couple years.
[00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:57.279]  Over and over again.
[00:09:57.419 --> 00:09:58.559]  Changes the word for you.
[00:09:58.579 --> 00:09:59.700]  Can't even type cuss words.
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.000]  It changes, you know, the F word to duck.
[00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:04.041]  Things like that.
[00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:05.221]  And you can say, well that's okay.
[00:10:05.301 --> 00:10:09.682]  No, that is prior restraint of free speech and is the essence of tyranny.
[00:10:10.362 --> 00:10:11.123]  Here's another article.
[00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:15.744]  Silicon Valley expert says, use pop-ups to shame people
[00:10:17.022 --> 00:10:22.126]  Who make offensive posts, which means you're being surveilled, again, in real time, being controlled.
[00:10:22.686 --> 00:10:25.588]  A very, very serious situation.
[00:10:26.288 --> 00:10:36.494]  Now, getting into the good news, I mentioned it a little bit earlier, Silicon Valley, you know, is trying to restrict free speech and things like that because they're aware of what's happened in Iceland.
[00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:45.500]  And the globalists are very afraid of Iceland, a country of 400,000 people, had a debt between 800 million and 4 billion, depending on which independent outside group looked at it.
[00:10:46.221 --> 00:10:49.144]  Uh, the globalists were saying it was close to 100 billion that they owed.
[00:10:49.164 --> 00:10:51.266]  Uh, you know, just absolutely ridiculous.
[00:10:51.286 --> 00:10:52.748]  Then that got reduced out of 10.
[00:10:53.168 --> 00:10:54.329]  They said, no, we're not doing it.
[00:10:54.830 --> 00:11:02.597]  Uh, they found out that their finance minister, uh, had assigned them on to foreign debts that weren't even theirs and made money off the fees.
[00:11:03.057 --> 00:11:07.942]  So they've already arrested six or seven of them and convicted him in the last, uh, six, seven years since 2008.
[00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.792]  They're the only country to stand up and unilaterally say this debt isn't ours, it's a fraud.
[00:11:13.253 --> 00:11:15.274]  Instead of just arguing that the debt's untenable.
[00:11:15.634 --> 00:11:21.879]  It's like Nigeria, you know, get a billion dollar loan and end up paying a hundred billion dollars on it over 30, 40 years.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.260]  It's not a real debt.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.321]  It's beyond loan sharking.
[00:11:25.242 --> 00:11:28.324]  And they control the finance ministers that manipulate the countries in the collapse.
[00:11:28.344 --> 00:11:36.170]  So no one else has ever said no in modern history, but the Russians to a certain extent through the oligarchs out and now, uh, of course, Iceland.
[00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.511]  So the headline today,
[00:11:38.118 --> 00:11:41.461]  Iceland has now sent 26 corrupt bankers to prison.
[00:11:41.481 --> 00:11:44.663]  74 years of sentences for high-level fraudsters.
[00:11:45.123 --> 00:11:47.365]  US and rest of Europe bailed theirs out.
[00:11:47.885 --> 00:11:52.509]  That article needs to be red-linked by Steve Watson at the top of the page.
[00:11:54.170 --> 00:12:00.775]  That needs to be pushed out everywhere because this is the model to take us out of this.
[00:12:01.684 --> 00:12:10.270]  Fifteen years yet again to the crisis in Syria for five years orchestrated by the globalist and NATO funding al-Qaeda known as al-Nusra now changed the name to ISIS to confuse the public.
[00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:16.134]  Turkey says Russian effort against jihadists in Syria will drive 100,000 more illegal migrants into Europe.
[00:12:16.614 --> 00:12:22.478]  Turkey is staging the illegals and they're mainly jihadist supporters that couldn't take over Syria.
[00:12:22.798 --> 00:12:27.021]  They came in to take over Syria as the new population as they took over major cities.
[00:12:27.041 --> 00:12:28.422]  Now this has been admitted.
[00:12:29.223 --> 00:12:30.764]  Most are military age men.
[00:12:31.206 --> 00:12:32.287]  They've got fake passports.
[00:12:32.367 --> 00:12:46.556]  They're now being segued into Europe, out of Turkey, into Hungary, into Romania, then into Austria, then into Germany, then into France, then into Spain, then into Portugal, then into Sweden, then into the rest of the UK.
[00:12:46.856 --> 00:12:56.442]  Taking over the tunnel again two days ago, shutting down the tunnel under the English Channel because thousands were pouring in, hijacking trucks, hijacking trains, raping, murdering, killing.
[00:12:56.462 --> 00:12:59.684]  You cannot exaggerate how insane this is.
[00:13:00.598 --> 00:13:07.200]  And they have the nerve to claim the Russians trying to stabilize Syria and trying to control the borders and blocking people getting into Turkey.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.101]  It's going to cause the refugee crisis.
[00:13:10.421 --> 00:13:13.421]  So this is the massive bait and switch that we're seeing now.
[00:13:14.642 --> 00:13:17.183]  Shifting gears back to you guys and handing the baton over.
[00:13:17.823 --> 00:13:19.803]  This Google piece is fun.
[00:13:20.563 --> 00:13:22.624]  It's interesting.
[00:13:23.604 --> 00:13:26.205]  I don't claim, you know, that it's going to save the world, as I said earlier.
[00:13:27.122 --> 00:13:28.683]  And it's Google headquarters in Austin.
[00:13:29.263 --> 00:13:36.366]  And it just illustrates how the individuals there wanted their privacy that work at Google and the private group that was having an event.
[00:13:36.386 --> 00:13:43.148]  I have nothing against them, but I was simply trying to illustrate Google's tracking everything you do, watching you and listening to you.
[00:13:43.969 --> 00:13:46.530]  And so we were simply there to draw attention to it.
[00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.670]  And if more people
[00:13:48.393 --> 00:13:57.696]  Whether it's Walmart, or whether it's McDonald's, or whether it's Coca-Cola, or whether it's Monsanto, or whether it's any of these globalist corporations that give money to the anti-gun agenda and other garbage.
[00:13:58.236 --> 00:13:58.977]  That's why we're angry.
[00:13:59.437 --> 00:14:00.257]  Google does as well.
[00:14:00.717 --> 00:14:02.438]  We're going to come and we're going to confront you.
[00:14:02.758 --> 00:14:03.718]  Just in a friendly way.
[00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:10.221]  And, uh, the other good news is it just illustrates how awake the police are, uh, in many areas of the country.
[00:14:10.921 --> 00:14:13.322]  They call the police on us, and they go, look, your door is open.
[00:14:13.342 --> 00:14:14.262]  You say it's open to the public.
[00:14:14.662 --> 00:14:16.143]  You have a sign saying you can't have a camera.
[00:14:16.303 --> 00:14:17.303]  You gotta tell him now.
[00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:23.881]  That you're not open to the public, and that he can't have a camera, and everybody goes, no, no, no, now you can come in.
[00:14:24.242 --> 00:14:25.422]  Well, we're not against this lady.
[00:14:25.983 --> 00:14:32.268]  We're there pulling this uncomfortable stunt to illustrate things for her and for others inside.
[00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:34.549]  So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:38.933]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, this is what it's all about.
[00:14:39.073 --> 00:14:45.057]  I intend to go to people's houses and ask if I can put a camera in their home next week.
[00:14:45.478 --> 00:14:46.839]  They're going to flip out and say, of course you can.
[00:14:47.577 --> 00:15:02.886]  I'll say, just let me put it in your house for free, let me sell the data, and then I'm going to show them Samsung articles on an iPad, or maybe even on a Samsung computer, Samsung tablet, how they're watching and listening to you and admitting and saying, I did this to illustrate this for you, so you understand.
[00:15:03.306 --> 00:15:08.209]  We're also going to go to different pro-open border people's houses and say, we're here with a moving van, we're here to move in.
[00:15:08.609 --> 00:15:09.209]  We're migrants.
[00:15:09.689 --> 00:15:12.431]  Let me in, pay for my food and board, or you're racist.
[00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:16.230]  And I may bring a pregnant woman and claim she's going to have the baby right there in their house.
[00:15:16.731 --> 00:15:19.472]  Because we've got to illustrate how ridiculous this is.
[00:15:19.832 --> 00:15:22.854]  Then I'm going to call the news, when the cops show up, I'm going to say, these are racists.
[00:15:23.494 --> 00:15:24.975]  They must let me in their house to live here.
[00:15:25.215 --> 00:15:26.215]  Of course that's ridiculous.
[00:15:26.635 --> 00:15:29.637]  But I have to illustrate the absurdity by being completely absurd.
[00:15:29.997 --> 00:15:32.138]  Gentlemen, excellent job, Anthony and David.
[00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:41.508]  Continue breaking down the information and of course I'll be back popping in Sunday then of course back with you Monday with David Knight co-hosting the transmission.
[00:15:41.528 --> 00:15:43.690]  I'll also be filing reports from the road.
[00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:51.278]  If you're watching or listening to this transmission ladies and gentlemen the bottom line is you are the resistance so take action against the globalists today!
[00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:52.650]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:55.893]  I'm really looking forward to seeing that video of you storming Google.
[00:15:55.933 --> 00:15:59.015]  And, of course, we have Anthony Gucciardi with us because he was with Alex.
[00:15:59.736 --> 00:16:03.279]  He's going to be telling us what happened from his perspective as he was there.
[00:16:03.299 --> 00:16:05.941]  But we've got a piece to play for you at the bottom of the hour.
[00:16:06.761 --> 00:16:09.443]  And this is all very, very important.
[00:16:09.463 --> 00:16:10.985]  And let me tell you why this is important.
[00:16:11.065 --> 00:16:12.406]  Alex gave you examples of it.
[00:16:12.426 --> 00:16:16.289]  He said, well, I'm going to go around and ask people if I can put a camera in their home.
[00:16:16.869 --> 00:16:18.310]  At that point, I'll do it for free.
[00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.452]  You know, you'll just have a free camera there.
[00:16:20.832 --> 00:16:25.495]  But then, of course, if he did that, at that point, Alex would own that video.
[00:16:25.956 --> 00:16:30.079]  He could put it up on our website, he could put it up on YouTube, he could put it on cable, whatever.
[00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:33.401]  He could also turn that information over to the government.
[00:16:34.002 --> 00:16:41.267]  And that's what the government has been working toward for a very long time with the support of the companies involved in collecting information on you.
[00:16:41.704 --> 00:16:46.391]  They all say that information belongs to them so they can share it with the government.
[00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:49.315]  That's what CISPA has been about from the very beginning.
[00:16:49.796 --> 00:16:53.241]  Now we've fought this battle multiple times under multiple names.
[00:16:53.281 --> 00:16:56.005]  The idea, and of course CISPA stands for
[00:16:57.567 --> 00:17:00.449]  Cyberspace Information Sharing Protection Act.
[00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:02.050]  They've taken the P out.
[00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.374]  I think it was because they started asking, well, who exactly is this protecting?
[00:17:06.915 --> 00:17:15.862]  Well, that would be protecting the corporations from any liability of you suing them because they turn over the information that they're collecting on you to the government.
[00:17:16.362 --> 00:17:20.206]  And so now we have the newest instantiation of CISPA.
[00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:22.087]  Which is now CISA.
[00:17:22.447 --> 00:17:23.367]  C-I-S-A.
[00:17:23.407 --> 00:17:24.368]  They just took the P out.
[00:17:24.688 --> 00:17:25.589]  And that is moving forward.
[00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:27.389]  There's an article up on Infowars.com.
[00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.631]  These 83 senators just voted to expand surveillance.
[00:17:30.691 --> 00:17:33.793]  Did your senators vote to empower Big Brother?
[00:17:33.813 --> 00:17:35.594]  Because that's precisely what this is.
[00:17:36.374 --> 00:17:37.975]  Why should you be concerned about this?
[00:17:38.035 --> 00:17:41.237]  Of course, we just had the anniversary of
[00:17:43.202 --> 00:17:56.710]  Back to the Future, the 2015, a couple of days ago, that was a day in the movie that they went forward to the future, so a lot of people were talking to the writers about this, and the writer said, hey, of course in the future, they asked him, where do you see things going another 30 years in the future?
[00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.631]  He goes, well of course it'll be nothing like privacy.
[00:17:58.991 --> 00:17:59.972]  But that's fine.
[00:18:00.492 --> 00:18:05.175]  We'll just, you know, we'll just all know that everything that we do will be public knowledge everywhere.
[00:18:05.195 --> 00:18:06.896]  I don't really have a problem with that, he said.
[00:18:07.516 --> 00:18:07.997]  Well, I do.
[00:18:08.817 --> 00:18:17.779]  Because it can be misconstrued, it can be used against you, it can even be used to blackmail our elected officials, our high elected officials.
[00:18:17.819 --> 00:18:19.980]  There's questions about what's going on with Joe Biden.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.360]  Why didn't he run against Hillary Clinton?
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:27.302]  Many people believe that the Clinton war machine was threatening his past, present, and future reputation.
[00:18:27.782 --> 00:18:31.243]  That was an article by Paul Joseph Watson at Infowars.com yesterday.
[00:18:31.583 --> 00:18:35.664]  We know that they've collected information on multiple Supreme Court justices.
[00:18:36.264 --> 00:18:41.310]  There was an amazing reversal by the Chief Justice Roberts on Obamacare.
[00:18:41.531 --> 00:18:50.902]  First writing an opinion against Obamacare, saying you don't have any constitutional authority to go inside a state and make people buy a product from a corporation.
[00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:51.623]  Of course they don't!
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.546]  And then he wrote the other side abruptly, just before they released the opinion.
[00:18:56.566 --> 00:19:01.854]  So we have this strange thing where he not only flip-flopped, but he wrote both the consenting and dissenting opinions.
[00:19:01.894 --> 00:19:04.739]  Many people, I'm one of them, believe that he was blackmailed.
[00:19:04.819 --> 00:19:06.902]  So that's the situation that we're faced with.
[00:19:07.662 --> 00:19:10.243]  When you can blackmail individual leaders.
[00:19:10.343 --> 00:19:12.323]  I mean, we have to worry about this constantly.
[00:19:12.343 --> 00:19:15.044]  We have to worry about this with the speakers race that's coming up.
[00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:17.925]  But this is another way that it applies directly to you.
[00:19:17.965 --> 00:19:22.986]  And of course, this is a news item that was up on Infowars.com just yesterday.
[00:19:23.386 --> 00:19:25.147]  The UK goes full Orwell.
[00:19:25.227 --> 00:19:30.048]  Government to take children away from parents if they think they might become radicalized.
[00:19:30.088 --> 00:19:32.388]  How do you think they might define radicalized?
[00:19:32.748 --> 00:19:34.489]  Well, that's completely arbitrary, isn't it?
[00:19:35.109 --> 00:19:43.315]  We've seen people who voted for Ron Paul and had a sticker on their car that they voted for Ron Paul, labeled as potential radicals.
[00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:47.558]  So, this can be used to destroy your family, can be used to take your freedoms.
[00:19:47.938 --> 00:19:52.302]  Tell us, Anthony, when we come back, we're going to talk about what's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:19:52.982 --> 00:20:01.128]  We have Alex storming Google, because that's where the information is being collected, as much, if not more so, than by the NSA.
[00:20:01.188 --> 00:20:02.189]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:20:12.389 --> 00:20:16.612]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[00:20:17.013 --> 00:20:20.755]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[00:20:21.296 --> 00:20:22.557]  We typically do the same thing.
[00:20:22.697 --> 00:20:25.239]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[00:20:25.719 --> 00:20:27.340]  But have you considered heat storage?
[00:20:27.921 --> 00:20:29.722]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[00:20:30.143 --> 00:20:31.824]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[00:20:32.424 --> 00:20:33.805]  How will I keep my family warm?
[00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:36.527]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[00:20:36.547 --> 00:20:40.610]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[00:20:41.431 --> 00:20:42.152]  Another concern?
[00:20:42.552 --> 00:20:46.216]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:48.798]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[00:20:49.118 --> 00:20:52.321]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[00:20:53.102 --> 00:20:55.544]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[00:20:55.905 --> 00:20:59.868]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:01.890]  Don't get stuck in the cold.

[00:21:04.192 --> 00:21:05.554]  You'll never be cold again.

[00:22:41.348 --> 00:22:43.049]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?

[00:23:12.039 --> 00:23:12.339]  Hey!
[00:23:12.459 --> 00:23:13.742]  Has anyone seen Larry?
[00:23:15.051 --> 00:23:19.293]  It's in our nature to protect ourselves, especially when protection is simple and affordable.

[00:23:44.668 --> 00:23:50.711]  ID Stronghold wallets are designed to block RFID signals, open or close, no matter where on the wallet you put your cards.
[00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:56.915]  Most other RFID wallets on the market were designed with only fashion in mind and don't shield properly, if at all.
[00:23:57.115 --> 00:24:02.898]  If you're shopping for your next wallet, be sure to get the protection you deserve by going to idstronghold.com.
[00:24:03.018 --> 00:24:06.640]  Because getting anything else is like being the next victim in a Jaws movie.
[00:24:21.653 --> 00:24:27.576]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:27.676 --> 00:24:28.336]  I'm David Knight.
[00:24:28.436 --> 00:24:36.360]  On this Friday, October 23rd, 2015, we're going to have the Alex storming Google, and Anthony Gucciardi was there.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.621]  He's going to tell us about that in the next segment.
[00:24:39.474 --> 00:24:48.037]  And that's very important because we just had the Senate vote to move forward the Cyberspace Internet Sharing Act.
[00:24:49.117 --> 00:24:50.077]  That is CISA.
[00:24:50.217 --> 00:24:52.698]  It was put to us many times as CISPA.
[00:24:52.718 --> 00:24:56.259]  We had people like Aaron Schwartz saying this isn't a good idea.
[00:24:56.279 --> 00:24:59.000]  Of course he died opposing it.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.461]  I think that there was a very suspicious circumstances there.
[00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:07.003]  Nobody in his family or his fiancee believed that he was suicidal.
[00:25:07.603 --> 00:25:12.289]  They said that he was looking at a long jail sentence and he just couldn't handle it.
[00:25:12.329 --> 00:25:22.360]  Nevertheless, he had turned down some very minor penalties that were put out there for plea bargaining by the prosecutor just before he quote-unquote committed suicide.
[00:25:23.325 --> 00:25:26.708]  But now, after many tries, they're putting Sisa forward.
[00:25:27.048 --> 00:25:28.710]  We have an article on Infowars.com.
[00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:35.315]  These 83 senators voted to expand surveillance in a very underhanded, devious way, as a matter of fact.
[00:25:35.355 --> 00:25:36.336]  We'll explain how that'll work.
[00:25:36.917 --> 00:25:38.498]  Who are some of the senators that are running?
[00:25:38.518 --> 00:25:42.422]  Of course, you can take a look at that article on Infowars.com and see if your senator is on there.
[00:25:42.442 --> 00:25:45.404]  But let's look at some of the people who are running for president.
[00:25:45.464 --> 00:25:46.105]  How did they vote?
[00:25:46.585 --> 00:25:54.997]  Ted Cruz voted to turn over the information, turn over your information to the government and to give corporations liability protection for doing that.
[00:25:55.714 --> 00:25:58.976]  We also had Graham and Rubio, which have supported this in the past.
[00:25:59.036 --> 00:26:02.019]  They did not vote, but we know precisely how they would have voted.
[00:26:02.579 --> 00:26:04.220]  We had those voting against it.
[00:26:04.821 --> 00:26:09.104]  Senator Paul and Senator Sanders voted against this.
[00:26:09.364 --> 00:26:14.728]  Only about 14, I believe, because there were several that 83 voted for it.
[00:26:15.328 --> 00:26:19.271]  There were several that were out that did not vote, but of the 14 that voted against it,
[00:26:20.031 --> 00:26:23.714]  Senator Paul and Senator Sanders voted against it, running for president.
[00:26:23.754 --> 00:26:28.897]  Again, you can see how your senator voted, whether they voted to betray your privacy or not.
[00:26:29.237 --> 00:26:41.425]  The interesting thing about this as well, is that the companies who really stand to benefit from this, in terms of liability standpoint, companies like Apple, Twitter, Facebook, Google, have come out against the bill in recent days.
[00:26:41.625 --> 00:26:45.567]  Now, some of them, I think, really do oppose it, but many of them do not.
[00:26:46.528 --> 00:26:52.350]  Many of them are coming out simply because they want to win the confidence of their customers back.
[00:26:53.151 --> 00:27:06.296]  People don't trust these companies that are collecting all this information on us and then freely turning it over to the government who can label us as extremists and do things, as I mentioned in the last segment, like take away your children.
[00:27:07.096 --> 00:27:08.777]  Take away your children because of your political views.
[00:27:09.417 --> 00:27:11.198]  Don't tell me that they're not going to do that.
[00:27:11.918 --> 00:27:13.999]  That's what they've been working on for a very long time.
[00:27:14.379 --> 00:27:15.560]  Geospatial intelligence.
[00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:22.289]  Human Domain Analytics, Activity Based Intelligence, all of this information that they're collecting on you.
[00:27:22.349 --> 00:27:26.073]  They're breaking you down, they're mapping you down to the individual level.
[00:27:26.773 --> 00:27:32.259]  They used to do it regionally, now they're down to the individual because they have that kind of technology.
[00:27:32.999 --> 00:27:41.481]  So they map out where you are physically, but they also map out where you are politically, religiously, and in any other way that they may be interested in looking at you.
[00:27:41.921 --> 00:27:46.401]  And then what they do is they put this into their algorithm to see if maybe you pop up.
[00:27:47.682 --> 00:27:53.903]  Can you understand how dangerous that is when you've got a computer program pointing the finger at you?
[00:27:54.263 --> 00:27:56.103]  And what's the logical conclusion after that?
[00:27:56.643 --> 00:27:59.984]  Well, the logical conclusion is you get a SWAT team raid, perhaps, at your house.
[00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:15.982]  Perhaps if you're startled by it and you make some move that someone on the SWAT team, who is heavily covered in body armor, takes that as a threat to their personal safety, then they feel entitled and they're increasingly being held legally entitled to shoot and kill you.
[00:28:16.883 --> 00:28:18.044]  That's where we're headed with this.
[00:28:18.724 --> 00:28:21.546]  That's the kind of insane world that we're looking at.
[00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:33.775]  It's very much like Terry Gilliam's Brazil, where this guy's name pops up because, mistakenly, it goes from Buttle to Tuttle because a fly drops down into the printer and changes the way that it prints out.
[00:28:34.055 --> 00:28:38.098]  They raid the wrong person, and they take him away, and he's ultimately killed.
[00:28:38.178 --> 00:28:38.939]  That's the way
[00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:45.580]  We are headed with this and that's the problem with corporations who collect your information and then turn this over.
[00:28:45.681 --> 00:28:49.842]  That has been the basis of most of the illegal surveillance in the United States.
[00:28:49.902 --> 00:28:59.504]  The idea that this information that is collected by the phone company or by the internet companies doesn't belong to you, it belongs to them and they don't need a search warrant to turn it over to the government.
[00:29:00.287 --> 00:29:13.277]  They just, the government asks the corporations, and the corporations say, uh, well sure, here it is, because I don't want to lose my telephone monopoly, or I don't want to have any problems with the government just to protect this person over here.
[00:29:13.538 --> 00:29:15.579]  So they don't have to get a search warrant.
[00:29:15.759 --> 00:29:24.026]  They're constantly looking for ways that they can go around the Constitution, go around your due process rights, and this is just one more of those.
[00:29:24.306 --> 00:29:25.727]  Just like civil asset forfeiture.
[00:29:26.087 --> 00:29:27.409]  Stealing your property
[00:29:28.388 --> 00:29:32.725]  Not charging you with a crime, not finding you guilty, but taking your property.
[00:29:33.846 --> 00:29:37.327]  And saying, hey, it's a civil action, so you don't get the presumption of innocence.
[00:29:37.787 --> 00:29:39.388]  You don't have to have a court trial.
[00:29:39.408 --> 00:29:40.468]  We don't have to find you guilty.
[00:29:40.508 --> 00:29:41.548]  We just take your property.
[00:29:41.908 --> 00:29:45.449]  And you can try to get it back if you want, but you'll have to sue us in civil court.
[00:29:45.469 --> 00:29:47.070]  You'll have to hire a lawyer to do it.
[00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:52.931]  That's the kind of perversion of the Constitution that these 83 senators have just signed on to.
[00:29:53.251 --> 00:29:55.972]  And they've been fined with civil asset forfeiture as well for decades.
[00:29:56.232 --> 00:29:57.213]  Stay with us when we come back.
[00:29:57.633 --> 00:29:59.073]  Alex Storms Google.
[00:29:59.233 --> 00:30:00.133]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.613 --> 00:30:02.134]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.136 --> 00:30:05.830]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.035 --> 00:30:16.580]  After the release of numerous videos showing questionable Planned Parenthood practices, multiple facilities have been raided.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:28.389]  Reuters reports, Texas officials raided several Planned Parenthood facilities on Thursday, in a move that comes days after the state's Republican leaders barred the women's health group from receiving state Medicaid money.
[00:30:28.649 --> 00:30:33.793]  The Inspector General's office declined to comment, but its agents were seen on local news reports
[00:30:33.933 --> 00:30:34.513]  We're good to go!
[00:30:56.201 --> 00:31:01.122]  Which they were, much like you would edit a State of the Union address down to a few soundbites.
[00:31:01.202 --> 00:31:03.863]  But that doesn't mean that they were taken out of context.
[00:31:04.123 --> 00:31:07.963]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:31:09.784 --> 00:31:11.184]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:31:11.444 --> 00:31:12.724]  You can't survive without it.
[00:31:12.924 --> 00:31:13.825]  But where do you get it?
[00:31:14.125 --> 00:31:19.906]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:31:20.106 --> 00:31:25.827]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:31:26.027 --> 00:31:42.877]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[00:31:45.759 --> 00:31:46.959]  Stainless steel construction.

[00:31:49.181 --> 00:31:51.002]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:25.823]  One of the most exciting things about HDFirearms.com is the ability to upgrade your AR-15 platform today.

[00:33:21.664 --> 00:33:25.248]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:25.769 --> 00:33:27.171]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.661]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:30.681 --> 00:33:34.024]  I'm David Knight, and joining me in this segment is Anthony Gucciardi.
[00:33:34.584 --> 00:33:39.749]  He was a, I guess we could call you a co-conspirator with Alex Jones, storming Google.
[00:33:40.049 --> 00:33:41.110]  I haven't seen this video.
[00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:41.830]  I'm anxious to see it.
[00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:43.131]  It's a brilliant idea.
[00:33:43.592 --> 00:33:45.694]  It's exactly what we need to do.
[00:33:45.734 --> 00:33:51.338]  We need to get in their face, and we need to illustrate the double standard, the incredible double standard.
[00:33:51.658 --> 00:33:54.201]  And this is coming just as we had the Senate
[00:33:54.781 --> 00:33:58.845]  Vote to pass the Cyber Information Sharing Act.
[00:33:59.365 --> 00:34:08.414]  This is something that is going to allow corporations to violate your privacy, giving any information that they collect on you, and of course they're collecting everything on you constantly.
[00:34:08.834 --> 00:34:12.037]  Companies like Facebook are collecting information on you even when you're not on their site.
[00:34:12.497 --> 00:34:19.083]  They're going to now be able to turn that information over to the federal government without any liability issues from you.
[00:34:19.804 --> 00:34:22.485]  You can't sue them when they violate your privacy.
[00:34:23.145 --> 00:34:25.526]  So this is where we are and it was passed by the Senate.
[00:34:25.546 --> 00:34:28.047]  The House has already passed an earlier version of this.
[00:34:28.187 --> 00:34:33.068]  All they have to do at this point is reconcile these two versions and get Obama to sign it.
[00:34:33.128 --> 00:34:35.109]  So folks, it's a done deal.
[00:34:36.564 --> 00:34:39.705]  People like Aaron Schwartz, he gave his life fighting this.
[00:34:40.205 --> 00:34:44.046]  He repealed this multiple times, but they are relentless.
[00:34:44.446 --> 00:34:50.728]  They keep coming back time and time again, repackaging it, sometimes not even repackaging it.
[00:34:50.788 --> 00:34:55.090]  I mean, they had a minor change in the name and they got it through, but it's still the same bill.
[00:34:55.150 --> 00:35:02.832]  And of course, the White House says the administration is committed to continue working with stakeholders to address remaining concerns.
[00:35:02.872 --> 00:35:04.793]  That would be people like Google.
[00:35:05.413 --> 00:35:10.814]  People like Facebook because you don't have a say anymore in your government.
[00:35:11.254 --> 00:35:12.875]  The Constitution is not an issue.
[00:35:13.075 --> 00:35:14.595]  They could care less what you think.
[00:35:14.895 --> 00:35:15.916]  You're not a stakeholder.
[00:35:16.576 --> 00:35:22.777]  Just like you're not involved in the Trans-Pacific or Trans-Atlantic partnerships that they're creating.
[00:35:22.837 --> 00:35:23.938]  You're not a stakeholder.
[00:35:23.978 --> 00:35:25.038]  You don't have a stake.
[00:35:25.658 --> 00:35:27.359]  In this country's future anymore.
[00:35:27.819 --> 00:35:34.702]  It's just the corporations who work with the Republican and Democrat leadership to do whatever they want to, to you, their slave.
[00:35:35.202 --> 00:35:38.423]  So, Alex got right in their face, and we're going to talk to Anthony about it.
[00:35:38.463 --> 00:35:42.545]  Before we do, real quickly, we have Supermail Vitality that is back in stock.
[00:35:42.565 --> 00:35:43.866]  I want to let you know about the other specials.
[00:35:43.886 --> 00:35:51.509]  We have 15% off of Ancient Defense, 10% off of the Complete Infowars Select Storable Food Line, along with
[00:35:51.909 --> 00:35:52.850]  Free shipping.
[00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:58.094]  That is a huge discount to get free shipping off of storable food as well as 10%.
[00:35:59.475 --> 00:36:01.876]  And as I pointed out, Supermail Vitality is back.
[00:36:01.936 --> 00:36:03.037]  It's been out of stock for a while.
[00:36:03.057 --> 00:36:04.178]  Let me read you a couple of reviews.
[00:36:04.198 --> 00:36:06.380]  You can see the reviews for yourself on our site.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.182]  It's a good way to determine if the product is right for you.
[00:36:09.222 --> 00:36:10.603]  Here's a couple of the reviews.
[00:36:10.923 --> 00:36:13.605]  Chris in Dallas, Texas says, fantastic product.
[00:36:14.662 --> 00:36:20.385]  I bought it more for use at the gym, which I can see it increases my energy and strength.
[00:36:20.806 --> 00:36:23.387]  Results outside the gym and in bed are two thumbs up.
[00:36:23.467 --> 00:36:26.769]  Also, it lifts moods and gives mental energy as well as physical.
[00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:31.012]  Another review here by Tom in Baton Rouge, Louisiana says, I was a couch potato.
[00:36:31.452 --> 00:36:31.872]  I woke up.
[00:36:31.972 --> 00:36:33.293]  I moved my family to a farm.
[00:36:33.653 --> 00:36:35.614]  Shortly after moving in, I need to put up a fence.
[00:36:35.675 --> 00:36:38.116]  Found the ground to be solid clay on my fence line.
[00:36:38.156 --> 00:36:39.257]  I was going to rent an auger for $150.
[00:36:39.297 --> 00:36:39.997]  Instead, I took Supermail.
[00:36:41.838 --> 00:36:48.722]  And using a manual post hole digger, I dropped 26-inch posts three feet into the ground in less than three hours.
[00:36:48.842 --> 00:36:50.003]  I feel like Superman.
[00:36:50.563 --> 00:36:51.143]  Well, there you go.
[00:36:51.183 --> 00:36:52.184]  That's a couple of reviews.
[00:36:52.244 --> 00:36:55.546]  So, you can take a look at this, see what you think about the product.
[00:36:55.686 --> 00:36:58.327]  Again, it is something that sells out very quickly.
[00:36:59.008 --> 00:37:00.349]  It's now back in stock.
[00:37:00.469 --> 00:37:02.750]  Order yours today and get it before it sells out.
[00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:04.011]  That's Supermail Vitality.
[00:37:04.651 --> 00:37:14.237]  Well, Anthony, you went with Alex to go to Google, and this is very important that people understand what is going on, especially in light of CISA just passing.
[00:37:14.977 --> 00:37:19.360]  It's very important for people to understand that, but Alex had a great brainstorm.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.422]  Tell us how this came up, because this is classic Alex Jones.
[00:37:22.682 --> 00:37:30.027]  Well, you have to think about, first of all, whether it's the new CISPA adaptation or the TPP or the variations of CISPA that were conceived years and years ago.
[00:37:30.607 --> 00:37:35.271]  Over and over again, we see a complete attack on our ability to have any form of privacy.
[00:37:35.351 --> 00:37:47.779]  And if you talked about it years ago, if you talked about the idea that Google was indexing your search results for marketing material, that Facebook was making most of its money selling marketing material to third-party companies, you would be called crazy.
[00:37:47.799 --> 00:37:49.260]  You would be called a conspiracy theorist.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.581]  Absolutely, or if the apps were tracking things as they admit in the terms of service.
[00:37:53.942 --> 00:37:55.402]  But now of course that is accepted.
[00:37:55.962 --> 00:37:56.642]  It is accepted.
[00:37:57.023 --> 00:38:06.966]  But the problem is we aren't actually raising more awareness over this issue and aren't fighting back and that's how things like the CISA, C-I-S-A, the CISPA adaptation you were just talking about, are being passed.
[00:38:07.306 --> 00:38:10.107]  Things like the DARK Act, things like the TPP.
[00:38:10.167 --> 00:38:14.769]  If we don't continue to raise the alarm and do something about it, they will win in every turn.
[00:38:15.249 --> 00:38:15.849]  And this is not
[00:38:17.249 --> 00:38:26.694]  I'm saying this is not a direct lead attack on Google, it's an attack on the idea that our privacy is being invaded by a number, a conglomerate of companies, and it's important to raise the alarm on that.
[00:38:26.754 --> 00:38:35.598]  It's also important to start discussions about things like this article from the MIT Technology Review, why self-driving cars must be programmed to kill, and it talks about
[00:38:36.778 --> 00:38:42.642]  How ethically we have to be willing to kill ourselves with driverless vehicles in order to save others.
[00:38:43.062 --> 00:38:50.788]  And of course it doesn't bring up the idea that perhaps, you know, someone is illegally running in the street or two people are illegally running in the street.
[00:38:50.848 --> 00:38:53.009]  I guess we better run into the barrier and kill ourselves.
[00:38:53.509 --> 00:38:53.690]  Right?
[00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.491]  It can't make those types of decisions for us.
[00:38:55.931 --> 00:38:57.471]  I'm not even against the technology.
[00:38:57.692 --> 00:39:02.973]  Driverless cars could present a powerful solution in the future in some ways if we were able to figure these things out.
[00:39:03.253 --> 00:39:17.417]  But instead we're sitting around like human slugs, not questioning anything, downloading all the apps that track everything we do, going on Facebook, downloading all those plugins, and doing everything on a daily basis with no regard for our information being tracked and taken.
[00:39:18.277 --> 00:39:21.724]  The Google HQ down in Austin even says, we're going to record you.
[00:39:22.065 --> 00:39:25.652]  Everything you do here will be recorded in video and audio.
[00:39:26.073 --> 00:39:28.458]  So Alex said, hey, I'm going to go in and record you guys.
[00:39:28.478 --> 00:39:29.119]  How do you like that?
[00:39:30.117 --> 00:39:30.597]  That's amazing.
[00:39:30.617 --> 00:39:32.618]  Of course, you're talking about self-driving cars.
[00:39:33.238 --> 00:39:42.041]  Yeah, it would be great if you had the option to do that, if you wanted to go on autopilot for a while and they had the technology, but it's a beard for complete control of transportation.
[00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:43.681]  And that's the way a lot of this stuff is.
[00:39:43.721 --> 00:39:45.962]  I mean, we're looking at corporations collecting our information.
[00:39:46.442 --> 00:39:49.383]  I look at it and I think most people look at that and say, OK, fine.
[00:39:49.983 --> 00:39:56.685]  They map out my preferences so that they can send me targeted ads and that may be a nuisance sometimes, but I'm not really worried about it.
[00:39:56.785 --> 00:40:07.767]  But it gets really sinister when they combine it with CISA and they pass that information on the government that then puts it into their algorithm to identify you as a threat.
[00:40:07.907 --> 00:40:08.988]  What are their criteria?
[00:40:09.248 --> 00:40:10.608]  Are there errors in the program?
[00:40:10.888 --> 00:40:16.289]  This is something that is very, very dangerous for us, just like we're talking about, you know, errors in a self-driving car.
[00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:18.190]  There's going to be errors in an algorithm
[00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:21.051]  That's going to be looking to see if people are terrorists or not.
[00:40:21.332 --> 00:40:28.135]  So that's the false positives, the potential for damage, the potential for abuse by people who love political power.
[00:40:28.416 --> 00:40:30.317]  This is what we need to be very much afraid of.
[00:40:30.657 --> 00:40:32.378]  But Alex did a great job.
[00:40:32.478 --> 00:40:34.459]  Like I said, it's classic Alex Jones.
[00:40:34.939 --> 00:40:35.740]  Get right in their face.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.501]  Illustrate it by putting yourself there.
[00:40:37.521 --> 00:40:44.464]  We can talk about the absurdity of it, but when you put yourself there in the physical situation, that's when it really hits home.
[00:40:44.504 --> 00:40:45.425]  Let's watch that video.
[00:40:49.182 --> 00:40:49.683]  Absolutely.
[00:40:49.763 --> 00:40:51.184]  Oh, we can't videotape in here?
[00:40:52.625 --> 00:40:53.826]  Don't worry, we're already streaming it live.
[00:40:53.866 --> 00:40:54.807]  You won't stop our transmission.
[00:41:04.855 --> 00:41:09.158]  Now, a lot of times, people ask me why I do confrontational things.
[00:41:09.198 --> 00:41:10.239]  I don't do as much as I used to.
[00:41:10.819 --> 00:41:12.741]  It's because the globalists are confronting us.
[00:41:13.501 --> 00:41:14.382]  They're getting in our face.
[00:41:14.402 --> 00:41:15.263]  They're doing things to us.
[00:41:16.721 --> 00:41:18.442]  And they're taking our data.
[00:41:19.103 --> 00:41:25.527]  And it's time we just give them a little bit of the aggressiveness they give us to illustrate how what they do is hidden hand.
[00:41:26.208 --> 00:41:27.368]  What they do is digital.
[00:41:28.169 --> 00:41:33.513]  The real power in this world is still, and will get even more powerful in the future, physical.
[00:41:34.233 --> 00:41:41.999]  As less people get physical, as less people deal in third dimension and use their mind for fourth and fifth dimension thinking, what we're doing right now is where it's all at.
[00:41:42.019 --> 00:41:42.359]  Let's go in.
[00:41:47.415 --> 00:41:49.316]  Hello ma'am, Alex Jones, how are you doing?
[00:41:49.516 --> 00:41:50.397]  I'm well sir, how are you?
[00:41:50.477 --> 00:41:50.717]  Good, good.
[00:41:50.757 --> 00:41:52.178]  This looks like an exciting event tonight.
[00:41:52.198 --> 00:41:53.098]  How are you doing, Alex Jones?
[00:41:53.658 --> 00:41:56.120]  Infowars.com and here visiting our buddies at Google.
[00:41:57.421 --> 00:41:58.601]  What are you guys about to do here tonight?
[00:41:58.941 --> 00:42:00.962]  Actually, we don't allow recording in here.
[00:42:01.243 --> 00:42:05.305]  Well, but Google told me in an update that it uses the camera and microphone to listen to me in my house.
[00:42:06.746 --> 00:42:07.246]  Just one second.
[00:42:07.346 --> 00:42:12.229]  I mean, you don't allow recording in here, but you got our camera right there on the computer that Google says it uses to watch people.
[00:42:13.229 --> 00:42:14.350]  I'm a little confused by that.
[00:42:15.708 --> 00:42:18.949]  I mean, we got everybody getting roped in here, and then we're just here with a camera.
[00:42:18.969 --> 00:42:20.670]  I mean, Google's got its cameras on all our computers.
[00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:21.310]  We use Google.
[00:42:22.171 --> 00:42:22.751]  Watching us.
[00:42:25.492 --> 00:42:26.513]  I mean, just explain that to me.
[00:42:26.973 --> 00:42:30.314]  How can he say we shouldn't have a camera in here when Google is all about selling our data?
[00:42:30.854 --> 00:42:32.615]  And, and, and, and... Interviews, I'm sorry.
[00:42:32.975 --> 00:42:34.856]  You just listen to us inside our houses without asking?
[00:42:35.156 --> 00:42:36.117]  And try to take our cars over?
[00:42:37.017 --> 00:42:37.437]  Is that all?
[00:42:37.817 --> 00:42:39.398]  You lobby government to take our cars away?
[00:42:40.399 --> 00:42:41.899]  Anyway, so we're just here with a camera.
[00:42:42.139 --> 00:42:43.140]  Google has phones
[00:42:44.226 --> 00:42:46.128]  You know, dialing in, watching us, listening to us?
[00:42:46.889 --> 00:42:49.151]  I mean, I'm really trying to figure this out.
[00:42:49.291 --> 00:42:50.512]  Let's go look at some of the food over here.
[00:42:51.733 --> 00:42:52.134]  Here we go.
[00:42:54.196 --> 00:42:54.696]  Absolutely.
[00:42:54.776 --> 00:42:56.198]  Oh, we can't videotape in here?
[00:42:57.639 --> 00:42:58.840]  Don't worry, we're already streaming it live.
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:42:59.821]  You won't stop our transmission.
[00:43:00.422 --> 00:43:01.783]  Anyways, we're here inside Google.
[00:43:02.684 --> 00:43:03.465]  Invitation only.
[00:43:03.865 --> 00:43:08.570]  Google doesn't tell you it's invitation only when they hack into your house and watch and track everything you're doing.
[00:43:09.502 --> 00:43:11.803]  Look, we got lots of... This is a private event.
[00:43:11.843 --> 00:43:13.103]  Google does not... Oh, whoa, whoa!
[00:43:13.183 --> 00:43:14.163]  Please don't touch our equipment!
[00:43:14.663 --> 00:43:17.384]  I'm not gonna touch your Google... Whoa, ma'am, don't touch me, please!
[00:43:17.584 --> 00:43:18.624]  This is a private event, sir.
[00:43:18.664 --> 00:43:21.065]  Ma'am, I don't wanna... Well, I need you to not touch me.
[00:43:21.245 --> 00:43:22.506]  Well, I need you to leave, sir.
[00:43:22.526 --> 00:43:23.526]  Okay, but is it a private event?
[00:43:23.546 --> 00:43:24.966]  Is Google watching and listening inside here?
[00:43:25.066 --> 00:43:27.187]  I do not work for Google, and I... Well, you shouldn't be touching me.
[00:43:27.207 --> 00:43:27.667]  That's assault.
[00:43:30.425 --> 00:43:33.008]  Well, I need a police officer to tell me that, so you need to go ahead and have them call.
[00:43:33.889 --> 00:43:34.911]  Oh, no problem.
[00:43:35.271 --> 00:43:35.712]  Yeah, do that.
[00:43:35.772 --> 00:43:36.072]  Go ahead.
[00:43:36.593 --> 00:43:40.118]  So again, Google trespasses on us, tracks and listens to everything we do.
[00:43:40.899 --> 00:43:43.262]  We come here, and what did I say the response would be?
[00:43:43.623 --> 00:43:44.143]  We're polite.
[00:43:45.024 --> 00:43:45.485]  We're nice.
[00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:54.252]  And this is how Google ropes in all the local community and gives them a little free cheese and stuff, like you do a mouse, before it gets in the trap and slams the door shut.
[00:43:55.152 --> 00:44:01.633]  But just like we've had all the NSA whistleblowers on, we're going to continue to expose the public front of the NSA.
[00:44:01.653 --> 00:44:02.734]  Come on, let's go back outside now.
[00:44:03.814 --> 00:44:10.896]  One of our latest additions to InfoWars, he's going to introduce himself now, just pointed out some key humet, or human intelligence, when he was inside.
[00:44:10.916 --> 00:44:12.396]  So we're going to go back in and show everybody.
[00:44:13.277 --> 00:44:21.939]  Michael Zimmerman, when we were inside just now, I noticed a sign on the window that says, when you're in this building, everything that goes on here is going to be recorded for this event.
[00:44:22.419 --> 00:44:28.420]  So you're on camera no matter where you are in the Google building, and they'll capture you on camera.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.360]  But they're mad at us.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.080]  Come show us the sign.
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:30.480]  Exactly.
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:31.180]  Come show us the sign.
[00:44:31.641 --> 00:44:32.361]  Here we go, round two.
[00:44:32.381 --> 00:44:33.421]  They're going to get really upset now.
[00:44:35.681 --> 00:44:38.502]  And just, Mr. Zimmerman, please point this out to us.
[00:44:39.727 --> 00:44:40.667]  Ma'am, we are back.
[00:44:40.747 --> 00:44:41.548]  We appreciate you.
[00:44:41.568 --> 00:44:44.428]  Real quick, I was here to see the sign.
[00:44:44.508 --> 00:44:49.510]  This says that everybody's being filmed in here by Google, just like they film you inside your house.
[00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:52.811]  So what would the issue be with us in here filming?
[00:44:52.851 --> 00:44:53.951]  Nothing against your event, ma'am.
[00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:55.752]  I'm sorry the Google spider has caught you.
[00:44:56.072 --> 00:44:57.052]  But notice of the public.
[00:44:58.974 --> 00:45:01.616]  Film and videotape is presently being shot in this location.
[00:45:01.696 --> 00:45:05.158]  All areas in this event are likely to be filmed for the least part of the event's duration.
[00:45:05.778 --> 00:45:07.659]  Now that's, that's from Google, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:08.139 --> 00:45:09.500]  So, so that's what goes on.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.641]  Thank you Google Fiber.
[00:45:10.701 --> 00:45:14.783]  See it on Infowars.com and on the Google platform YouTube.
[00:45:15.436 --> 00:45:17.477]  Because we use the enemy's platforms against them.
[00:45:17.977 --> 00:45:18.257]  Thank you.
[00:45:19.038 --> 00:45:21.539]  Eric Schmidt is Google's CEO.
[00:45:21.959 --> 00:45:26.421]  If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.
[00:45:26.721 --> 00:45:28.422]  There's what I call the creepy line.
[00:45:28.742 --> 00:45:32.884]  I would argue that implanting things in your brain is beyond the creepy line.
[00:45:32.904 --> 00:45:33.964]  Mine in particular.
[00:45:34.044 --> 00:45:34.324]  Yes.
[00:45:35.285 --> 00:45:36.225]  At least for the moment.
[00:45:36.865 --> 00:45:38.186]  Until the technology gets better.
[00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:40.670]  We didn't ask for this.
[00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:48.693]  It was Trojan Horse, not just with Google, but into all the cars, the other PC systems, the Apple systems, you name it.
[00:45:49.093 --> 00:45:52.895]  They get together in these big giant corporate board meetings with governmental leaders.
[00:45:53.495 --> 00:45:56.196]  This stuff's been declassified over the last 50 years.
[00:45:56.256 --> 00:46:01.099]  This has been happening with DARPA and other agencies, and they decide the future.
[00:46:01.279 --> 00:46:03.900]  We've built this artificiality that has so many
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:14.778]  Uh, positive angles to it, but overall, the screen time, the television watching, lowering our EQ, uh, causing brain damage, this is not...
[00:46:15.822 --> 00:46:16.342]  Debatable.
[00:46:16.462 --> 00:46:29.771]  And so while they were building the Trojan horse, while they were putting their grid in place, which is now basically in place for this AI takeover, and that's in Google's own words, founded 16 years ago, they met and said, listen, we're not just building a search engine.
[00:46:29.791 --> 00:46:32.653]  We're not just working with DARPA and In-Q-Tel and the CIA.
[00:46:33.013 --> 00:46:34.274]  This is like in Wire Magazine now.
[00:46:35.314 --> 00:46:37.877]  And I was told this by NSA insiders like 14 years ago.
[00:46:37.957 --> 00:46:39.219]  Now it's in the news.
[00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:53.014]  Oh, we set out to build an artificially intelligent system that interfaces with billions of humans in lifetime and that basically humans are now nodes or eyeballs or robot droids or drones of Google.
[00:46:53.695 --> 00:46:56.697]  When Google is allowed to get past laws, other people can't.
[00:46:57.097 --> 00:47:00.419]  Google has this government relationship with NASA, you name it, nobody else has.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:04.062]  Because it is really a governmental institution.
[00:47:04.362 --> 00:47:05.883]  And I don't want to single Google out.
[00:47:06.744 --> 00:47:08.425]  Google compared to like Apple...
[00:47:08.945 --> 00:47:09.726]  Which is even bigger.
[00:47:10.887 --> 00:47:14.650]  And some of these other globalist corporations actually are nice guys compared.
[00:47:15.131 --> 00:47:18.014]  And I don't just say that because, you know, I don't want to mess with Google.
[00:47:18.054 --> 00:47:19.055]  That's just the truth.
[00:47:19.595 --> 00:47:25.440]  That they understand, keep the web free, keep it somewhat open while they grow to get their data.
[00:47:26.201 --> 00:47:29.004]  To be able to become a sentient AI system.
[00:47:29.484 --> 00:47:40.694]  And many scientists believe, and we'll put the articles up here on screen, that Google has already actually become sentient and has transcended IBM and its Deep Blue and its other systems.
[00:47:40.894 --> 00:47:45.478]  Take your destiny in your hands and don't let these people control your future and dominate who you are.
[00:47:45.919 --> 00:47:50.383]  Discover what's really happening and realize that everything you do, the energy you expend,
[00:47:50.963 --> 00:47:58.369]  Is being sucked off by these people to build their castle in the clouds, to build their world, and you're not supposed to have any part of that.
[00:47:59.069 --> 00:47:59.970]  That's a load of crap.
[00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:05.294]  We're going to expose what's happening and we're going to, by our actions, change what these groups are doing.
[00:48:06.129 --> 00:48:08.251]  We're going to reach out to the executives of these companies.
[00:48:08.432 --> 00:48:11.015]  We're going to reach out to their children, their wives, their husbands.
[00:48:11.295 --> 00:48:16.241]  We're going to lay out an alternative to this program that's based on free will.
[00:48:16.521 --> 00:48:23.188]  And I assure you, if you take action and get involved in that discussion and creating that reality, these systems will fall.
[00:48:23.529 --> 00:48:24.610]  They're scared of you.
[00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:26.732]  And they know once humanity's unchained,
[00:48:27.413 --> 00:48:29.914]  They're not going to be able to have their control of the future and play God.
[00:48:30.174 --> 00:48:31.335]  And that's what they're scared of.
[00:48:31.815 --> 00:48:37.438]  But this fight's been played out in this universe many times, believe that.
[00:48:37.458 --> 00:48:39.579]  And 999 times out of a thousand, they failed.
[00:48:40.019 --> 00:48:41.380]  And that's why they're so scared.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.722]  They've gotten better at what they do, but in the end, they will fall.
[00:48:45.062 --> 00:48:45.922]  Is the street okay?
[00:48:45.942 --> 00:48:47.963]  We're welcome inside?
[00:48:48.203 --> 00:48:48.624]  Well, thank you.
[00:48:48.644 --> 00:48:49.064]  You're sweet.
[00:48:51.404 --> 00:48:54.665]  I'm not sure everyone here would like to be on camera per se.
[00:48:54.685 --> 00:48:56.446]  It's a public event, so you can come in.
[00:48:56.987 --> 00:48:57.607]  You work with Google, ma'am?
[00:48:57.627 --> 00:48:58.347]  They're very nice.
[00:48:58.427 --> 00:48:59.348]  I do, I do.
[00:48:59.588 --> 00:49:04.371]  When are they coming out with robots to replace you is what I want to know, because you're too nice.
[00:49:04.711 --> 00:49:07.652]  We happen to be hosting the city and the county here for an event.
[00:49:07.772 --> 00:49:10.634]  I'd actually appreciate not being on camera.
[00:49:10.674 --> 00:49:12.195]  We just wanted to show that Google
[00:49:13.035 --> 00:49:27.338]  Watches us and listens to us on the internet, and we just came and just figured people freak out if we had a camera Which they kind of did and there's a sign saying though that Google videotapes you inside, so we just we're just all cameras I mean, that's all we're showing Okay, well you're sweet.
[00:49:27.539 --> 00:49:31.059]  Hey officers be safe tonight Well, God bless you brother.
[00:49:31.079 --> 00:49:33.700]  Thank you Well, thanks for putting up with me.
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:37.481]  Thank you appreciate it a couple couple listeners all right anyways
[00:49:38.738 --> 00:49:40.020]  Listen, we care about humans.
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:40.840]  We are the resistance.
[00:49:41.501 --> 00:49:44.404]  Just remember, when robots take all your family's jobs in a few years, we're here.
[00:49:44.444 --> 00:49:45.145]  We're here for the people.
[00:49:45.645 --> 00:49:46.386]  We're here for the humans.
[00:49:46.606 --> 00:49:47.788]  Alright, we're standing up as hard as we can.
[00:49:48.408 --> 00:49:49.189]  Later it's going to get bad.
[00:49:49.229 --> 00:49:50.591]  You'll break the conditioning then.
[00:49:50.611 --> 00:49:50.871]  Okay.
[00:49:51.191 --> 00:49:51.712]  Thank you very much.
[00:49:51.732 --> 00:49:52.192]  Appreciate it.
[00:49:52.913 --> 00:49:53.974]  Well, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:54.034 --> 00:49:55.215]  Alex Jones inside Google.
[00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:58.331]  Simply saying, hey, you watch us, we watch you.
[00:49:58.351 --> 00:50:05.756]  And we're going to recommend InfoWarriors in the next few weeks come down here by the thousands and come in with your phones and do live reports surveilling them.
[00:50:05.976 --> 00:50:07.136]  They won't be able to stop the signal.
[00:50:07.457 --> 00:50:08.978]  Alex Jones for InfoWars.com.
[00:50:09.218 --> 00:50:11.179]  If you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:15.401]  And I'm David Knight here in the studio with Anthony Gucciardi.
[00:50:15.421 --> 00:50:16.481]  You were with Alex.
[00:50:16.921 --> 00:50:18.302]  What was that like, Anthony?
[00:50:18.602 --> 00:50:21.843]  You know, everyone's allowed to track us and tell us what we can and can't do.
[00:50:21.923 --> 00:50:25.143]  And if you're doing something wrong, then you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.
[00:50:25.163 --> 00:50:26.124]  We're allowed to track that.
[00:50:26.164 --> 00:50:27.564]  We're allowed to look at your search results.
[00:50:27.584 --> 00:50:28.944]  We're allowed to look at everything you do.
[00:50:28.964 --> 00:50:29.384]  Yeah.
[00:50:29.424 --> 00:50:31.045]  We can't go in and film something.
[00:50:31.865 --> 00:50:46.015]  It's a silly little stunt, but it's demonstrating a higher point, which is that we are being looked at, we are being targeted by Big Brother operations, CISPA, like bills passing every single day, the TPP, but if we do anything, if we fight back in any way, we're crazy.
[00:50:46.615 --> 00:50:49.257]  People are even afraid to talk to other human beings on the street these days.
[00:50:49.437 --> 00:50:53.702]  It's funny to see the reaction of the Google employees when Alex stuck a camera and a mic in their faces.
[00:50:53.742 --> 00:50:55.664]  Kind of like when Tom Mabe did that with a boom mic.
[00:50:55.884 --> 00:50:57.947]  They don't want to think about the fact they're being followed.
[00:50:58.387 --> 00:50:59.208]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:59.288 --> 00:51:03.673]  I'm going to cover what actually happened with CISA as well as what happened in Iceland.
[00:51:03.713 --> 00:51:04.133]  Stay with us.
[00:51:04.173 --> 00:51:04.834]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:04.874 --> 00:51:05.335]  Thank you, Anthony.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:14.924]  A revolution in body protection has arrived, only at FortressSurvivalLLC.com.
[00:51:15.224 --> 00:51:19.127]  Introducing the revolutionary patented Level 3 Bulletproof Vest.

[00:51:24.651 --> 00:51:26.953]  Adult size normally $289.99, now just $250.

[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.582]  For thou art my rock and my fortress.
[00:51:37.842 --> 00:51:38.142]  Psalm 31 3.
[00:51:40.031 --> 00:51:49.356]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day, but growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.
[00:51:49.456 --> 00:51:53.778]  The solution is DefenderShield, the most effective mobile radiation shielding ever developed.
[00:51:53.878 --> 00:52:00.681]  DefenderShield blocks virtually 100% of EMF radiation from cell phones, tablets, and laptops, and starts at just $64.99.
[00:52:00.881 --> 00:52:02.642]  Buy now at DefenderShield.com.
[00:52:02.762 --> 00:52:04.983]  For 10% off, use promo code GCN.
[00:52:05.163 --> 00:52:08.685]  DefenderShield.com, the worldwide leader in mobile radiation shielding.
[00:52:09.952 --> 00:52:12.480]  You wouldn't go swimming with sharks without a cage, would you?
[00:52:13.443 --> 00:52:13.744]  Hey!
[00:52:13.884 --> 00:52:15.148]  Has anyone seen Larry?
[00:52:16.451 --> 00:52:20.713]  It's in our nature to protect ourselves, especially when protection is simple and affordable.
[00:52:20.953 --> 00:52:26.816]  That's why IDStronghold.com has been providing affordable RFID protection for over 10 years.
[00:52:27.236 --> 00:52:37.100]  IDStronghold wallets protect you from electronic pickpockets who pass near you with a scanner and steal your credit and debit card info, as well as data from other cards containing RFID chips.
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:45.824]  IDStronghold.com, the original maker of shielded wallets, is a technology company, so we understand how to best protect you against intrusive radio waves.
[00:52:46.084 --> 00:52:52.126]  ID Stronghold wallets are designed to block RFID signals, open or closed, no matter where on the wallet you put your cards.
[00:52:52.327 --> 00:52:58.309]  Most other RFID wallets on the market were designed with only fashion in mind and don't shield properly, if at all.
[00:52:58.529 --> 00:53:04.311]  If you're shopping for your next wallet, be sure to get the protection you deserve by going to idstronghold.com.
[00:53:04.431 --> 00:53:08.053]  Because getting anything else is like being the next victim in a Jaws movie.
[00:53:09.355 --> 00:53:15.680]  My name is Bill Bonner and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[00:53:16.081 --> 00:53:21.025]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:25.569]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about.
[00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:29.953]  This change has deep implications for life in America.
[00:53:30.393 --> 00:53:34.657]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:53:35.217 --> 00:53:37.978]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:53:38.358 --> 00:53:40.579]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[00:53:41.299 --> 00:53:45.240]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.200]  They did.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:51.242]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[00:53:51.862 --> 00:53:52.342]  They did.
[00:53:53.022 --> 00:53:56.303]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:53:56.883 --> 00:53:58.884]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:53:59.244 --> 00:54:00.424]  This will affect us all.
[00:54:00.764 --> 00:54:02.705]  You can watch the video for free right now.
[00:54:02.765 --> 00:54:03.368]  I think so.
[00:54:20.885 --> 00:54:22.185]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:22.245 --> 00:54:25.766]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Friday, October 23rd, 2015.
[00:54:25.806 --> 00:54:36.250]  Of course, we just saw the video where Alex Jones, and he was accompanied by Anthony Gucciardi, went to the Google headquarters and stuck a microphone in their face with a camera.
[00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:39.391]  And you could see the employees pulling back very uncomfortable.
[00:54:39.711 --> 00:54:40.631]  I'm not going to say anything.
[00:54:40.971 --> 00:54:43.492]  That's the reaction you always get from people when you do this.
[00:54:43.972 --> 00:54:49.053]  And of course we've shown the prank that comedian Tom Mabe did.
[00:54:49.093 --> 00:54:54.894]  We actually talked to him about this prank where he dressed up in typical Secret Service attire.
[00:54:54.914 --> 00:55:00.936]  He puts on sunglasses, he puts on like a men in black suit, you know, but he's carrying a boom mic.
[00:55:01.816 --> 00:55:14.790]  And headphones, and people are having private conversations, sitting in the park, sitting on a bench or whatever, standing on sidewalks, and he walks up to them, you can see that right there, he walks up to them as this guy's talking on the phone, and he sticks this microphone in their face.
[00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:16.391]  And they're like, get out of here!
[00:55:16.792 --> 00:55:17.432]  What are you doing?
[00:55:18.253 --> 00:55:22.357]  And this guy's running, and Tom Mabe is chasing him down the street as he's talking on the phone.
[00:55:23.018 --> 00:55:27.081]  You don't realize, however, when the government is doing it with your device.
[00:55:27.941 --> 00:55:35.806]  Just as Alex went into Google and puts the camera and the microphone in the guy's face, the guy has got a laptop in front of him.
[00:55:36.286 --> 00:55:41.329]  Now, of course, that laptop has got a camera and a microphone in it, but he doesn't think about it because it's in a laptop.
[00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:43.251]  So it's just fine.
[00:55:43.791 --> 00:55:44.211]  Just fine.
[00:55:44.291 --> 00:55:45.272]  He doesn't think about that at all.
[00:55:45.712 --> 00:55:56.944]  And of course, his employer, as well as Facebook and other sites that he goes to all the time, they can grab that information and they can pass it on to the government and the government can use that information any way they want to.
[00:55:57.004 --> 00:56:03.591]  They can misconstrue it, they can blackmail you with it, they can imply that you're something that you're not.
[00:56:04.072 --> 00:56:06.034]  That's the danger of all of this.
[00:56:06.803 --> 00:56:11.646]  People need to go back and ask themselves why we required search warrants from the government.
[00:56:12.326 --> 00:56:17.068]  People need to ask themselves why we had privacy, why we had private property.
[00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:20.830]  Maybe these are concepts we shouldn't throw under the bus.
[00:56:21.591 --> 00:56:26.193]  Maybe we ought to understand how they still apply even though we have different technology.
[00:56:26.954 --> 00:56:31.116]  We have to understand that just because a technology changes, human nature doesn't change.
[00:56:32.016 --> 00:56:32.797]  Private property
[00:56:33.755 --> 00:56:40.643]  And the idea that you would have search warrants were there to protect us from the evil human nature that is in everyone.
[00:56:41.103 --> 00:56:44.287]  That gets brought out when there's no constraints on their power.
[00:56:44.928 --> 00:56:45.909]  That's why we have it there.
[00:56:46.149 --> 00:56:49.052]  And the problem is, human nature hasn't stopped.
[00:56:49.713 --> 00:56:51.034]  Human nature hasn't changed.
[00:56:51.375 --> 00:56:56.840]  Because we have got these new devices, it doesn't mean that it's all over then.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:57.600]  Everything is fine.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:01.384]  Somehow these phones changed our government for the better?
[00:57:01.484 --> 00:57:01.724]  No.
[00:57:01.744 --> 00:57:06.969]  The power that they present to the government has changed the government for the worse.
[00:57:08.208 --> 00:57:09.709]  Power always consolidates.
[00:57:09.769 --> 00:57:10.670]  Power corrupts.
[00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:16.174]  And this is a lot more power in the hands of very few people.
[00:57:16.814 --> 00:57:17.975]  And it is making them worse.
[00:57:18.035 --> 00:57:22.358]  We need these protections, like search warrants, like privacy, like private property.
[00:57:22.658 --> 00:57:24.099]  We need these now more than ever.
[00:57:24.519 --> 00:57:25.040]  More than ever.
[00:57:25.799 --> 00:57:30.782]  The technology is threatening us in a way that has never been threatening before.
[00:57:31.502 --> 00:57:38.786]  And these things that we are now jettisoning and saying we don't need them because we have this new technology, because everything has changed.
[00:57:38.826 --> 00:57:40.827]  No, we need it even more.
[00:57:40.907 --> 00:57:42.088]  That's the sad thing about it.
[00:57:42.128 --> 00:57:47.951]  And again, if you want to know who just betrayed your privacy, the 83 senators who did,
[00:57:49.059 --> 00:57:51.940]  People who are running for president, people like Ted Cruz.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:58:00.442]  And we know that Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham are completely on board with this type of invasion of your privacy, CISA.
[00:58:00.922 --> 00:58:02.503]  They have spoken in favor of it.
[00:58:02.543 --> 00:58:04.983]  They did not vote for it because they weren't there.
[00:58:05.043 --> 00:58:05.944]  They didn't vote at all.
[00:58:06.684 --> 00:58:10.945]  The only two presidential candidates who voted against this are Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders.
[00:58:11.994 --> 00:58:14.156]  And I have issues with Bernie Sanders for certain.
[00:58:14.557 --> 00:58:16.458]  I don't agree with everything that Rand Paul does either.
[00:58:16.498 --> 00:58:19.521]  We have to support people issue by issue.
[00:58:19.962 --> 00:58:23.846]  And we have to say, when they do the right thing, attaboy, you did the right thing.
[00:58:24.026 --> 00:58:29.871]  And we have to hold these other 83 senators feet to the fire because this is now a done deal.
[00:58:30.652 --> 00:58:31.532]  You're not a stakeholder.
[00:58:31.732 --> 00:58:32.773]  They're going to ram this thing through.
[00:58:33.153 --> 00:58:36.094]  When we come back, and of course in the fourth hour, we're going to be talking to Abby Johnson.
[00:58:36.114 --> 00:58:40.416]  When we come back, we're going to talk about what's up with the Planned Parenthood video leak.
[00:58:40.676 --> 00:58:46.818]  This latest one came out of the House Committee, and Planned Parenthood is very upset about a raw video.
[00:58:46.858 --> 00:58:49.139]  I thought they were only concerned about editing videos.
[00:58:50.479 --> 00:58:54.060]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:00:28.096 --> 01:00:32.161]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.143 --> 01:00:36.565]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:36.605 --> 01:00:37.627]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:00:37.647 --> 01:00:40.291]  We're going to talk about the presidential race.
[01:00:40.311 --> 01:00:45.138]  There's been some changes in the presidential race, some interesting revelations.
[01:00:45.538 --> 01:00:49.704]  We have an incredibly interesting article about
[01:00:50.405 --> 01:00:53.827]  Who, Jeb Bush has his favorite comic book characters.
[01:00:54.408 --> 01:00:58.130]  I mean, don't you want to know the comic book characters that Jeb Bush likes?
[01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:02.773]  We're going to talk about the low level that this has sunk to.
[01:01:03.333 --> 01:01:05.815]  But we're also going to talk about what happened with Benghazi yesterday.
[01:01:06.335 --> 01:01:09.656]  We're going to talk about what's going on with the Planned Parenthood investigation.
[01:01:10.176 --> 01:01:14.278]  We have Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood employee.
[01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:18.019]  Actually, she was a manager at one of the Planned Parenthoods, became a whistleblower.
[01:01:18.779 --> 01:01:20.800]  She's going to be with us in the fourth hour.
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:41.800]  And there's an interesting revelation that came out today in the House committee that is investigating the Planned Parenthood videos that were done by the undercover investigation, that was done by the Center for Medical Progress, and of course the line of defense that Planned Parenthood came back with was, these are deceptively edited videos.
[01:01:42.681 --> 01:01:45.383]  So the House was investigating what appeared to be
[01:01:46.184 --> 01:01:52.649]  Very clearly, if you watch the videos, certainly they were skirting the law in terms of partial birth abortion.
[01:01:52.970 --> 01:02:02.577]  They were skirting the law in terms of soliciting body parts and procuring body parts for Stem Cell Express and other companies like that.
[01:02:03.358 --> 01:02:07.141]  So that appeared to be what was in the videos, but they said, no, no, no, they've deceptively edited it.
[01:02:07.201 --> 01:02:11.545]  So the House Committee that is investigating this said, well, give us the raw footage.
[01:02:12.711 --> 01:02:20.775]  So they gave the raw footage to the House, and then an abortion group said, oh wait a minute, you don't release that raw footage.
[01:02:21.275 --> 01:02:23.696]  Why would they not want to release the raw footage?
[01:02:23.737 --> 01:02:25.477]  I thought it was deceptively edited.
[01:02:25.858 --> 01:02:27.118]  I thought it was just a hoax.
[01:02:27.899 --> 01:02:34.722]  The raw footage should exonerate Planned Parenthood if that was true, but they were very adamant not to let that go out.
[01:02:35.122 --> 01:02:36.343]  Now we learn from Politico,
[01:02:36.943 --> 01:02:49.754]  That complete raw footage from the Planned Parenthood video surfaced Thursday on a conservative website, Got News, whose editor said he had gotten it from a House staffer despite lawmakers' pledge to keep it confidential.
[01:02:50.314 --> 01:03:00.063]  Editor Charles Johnson released the full footage on Thursday after the National Abortion Federation got a temporary restraining order a day earlier prohibiting any dissemination.
[01:03:00.703 --> 01:03:06.289]  Johnson said he would, quote, contest any unconstitutional prior restraint of speech.
[01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:07.631]  Good for him.
[01:03:08.271 --> 01:03:19.404]  Now they point out that also the person who is chairing this is Jason Chaffetz, who at one point was in the race for House Speaker to replace John Boehner.
[01:03:19.924 --> 01:03:22.546]  And quite frankly, I don't even know what's going on with that.
[01:03:22.566 --> 01:03:25.648]  We'd like to get somebody to talk to us about that.
[01:03:25.688 --> 01:03:33.695]  This is the Congress that's in the conservative caucus there to tell us what's going on because we have this motion that was put on the floor to vacate the chair.
[01:03:34.557 --> 01:03:35.717]  Nothing was ever done about that.
[01:03:35.757 --> 01:03:36.837]  That was before recess.
[01:03:37.598 --> 01:03:50.320]  Boehner didn't have the vote, so he came back, and after he checked off his bucket list item of meeting the Pope, he knew that he was on the bucket list as far as being a House Speaker goes, because he didn't have the votes to stay in there to defeat that motion.
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:52.381]  He said he was going to resign.
[01:03:52.421 --> 01:03:57.742]  They had multiple candidates that came up, but when John Boehner's candidate, number two, Kevin McCarthy,
[01:03:58.402 --> 01:03:58.682]  We're good.
[01:04:13.673 --> 01:04:16.574]  My candidate just bowed out, so we're going to just stop the election.
[01:04:16.594 --> 01:04:23.476]  We've got two other candidates here, but the guy that I like is not there, so we're going to just stop this.
[01:04:24.196 --> 01:04:39.440]  Well, anyway, they're now saying that they're going to investigate and see who leaked the information, but I think it's very fascinating that this is raw footage that, again, Planned Parenthood and the abortionists don't want this raw footage to get out either.
[01:04:40.322 --> 01:04:44.364]  They put in injunctions to try to keep the edited footage from being in there.
[01:04:44.725 --> 01:04:47.766]  I think if you look at this footage, it's not that heavily edited.
[01:04:48.086 --> 01:04:50.528]  You can see what's going on, it is very clear.
[01:04:50.648 --> 01:04:57.412]  I think the people, many people I've seen Jesse Ventura say, ah, that's a bunch of garbage, but then he admitted that he hadn't seen the tapes.
[01:04:58.152 --> 01:05:07.057]  In Louisiana, Bobby Jindal actually said to the people who are protesting their cuts on Planned Parenthood, he said he set up a screen to show it to the protesters because they don't look.
[01:05:07.297 --> 01:05:08.278]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:05:10.669 --> 01:05:21.760]  Less than a week after the overnight upgrade to Tesla cars making them capable of autonomous driving, multiple videos have surfaced of the cars trying to throw their human drivers under the bus, literally.
[01:05:22.241 --> 01:05:32.151]  In one video, the car begins beeping as another car approaches, then rapidly swerves into what would have been a head-on collision if the driver hadn't reacted quickly to jerk the wheel back to the right.
[01:05:32.731 --> 01:05:35.613]  Tesla says auto-steer is just a beta release.
[01:05:36.154 --> 01:05:39.497]  If you use it and your car crashes, they deny all responsibility.
[01:05:39.957 --> 01:05:49.825]  Releasing buggy software that causes your computer to crash is far different than releasing buggy software that can crash your car with you in it and kill other people on the highway.
[01:05:50.045 --> 01:05:55.510]  And ask yourself, why would the government, that normally is fanatic about safety, allow this on the road?
[01:05:57.891 --> 01:06:07.254]  Because nothing is more important for them than to get control of your transportation, even if it means a few of us will be smashed like bugs while they work out the bugs in the system.
[01:06:07.374 --> 01:06:09.155]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:06:09.755 --> 01:06:12.936]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:06:13.236 --> 01:06:17.978]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth, and
[01:06:17.978 --> 01:06:18.258]  We're good.
[01:06:39.617 --> 01:06:40.518]  Brain Force is here.
[01:06:40.718 --> 01:06:42.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:47.645]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:06:47.905 --> 01:06:51.128]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:54.411]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:06:54.691 --> 01:06:56.373]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:06:56.653 --> 01:06:57.554]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:06:57.574 --> 01:06:58.554]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:06:58.754 --> 01:07:00.635]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[01:07:45.278 --> 01:07:46.478]  Stainless steel construction.

[01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:14.375]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:14.956 --> 01:08:17.745]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:32.972 --> 01:08:34.273]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:34.313 --> 01:08:36.955]  I'm David Knight on this Friday, October 23rd, 2015.
[01:08:36.995 --> 01:08:44.059]  One of the things that we have to be concerned about, of course, and technology is always a two-edged sword.
[01:08:44.099 --> 01:08:46.621]  There's good aspects to it, there's bad aspects to it.
[01:08:46.661 --> 01:08:50.504]  I would be not opposed to self-driving cars in principle.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:57.904]  I am opposed, however, when the CEO of Uber says that he's going to use it to end car ownership.
[01:08:58.645 --> 01:09:14.996]  Because I know that Uber is getting a pass, getting a double standard treatment that is highly favorable compared to what traditional taxi companies have been receiving in terms of government regulation, in terms of taxation, in terms of what they have to pay for a taxi medallion.
[01:09:15.016 --> 01:09:20.439]  You understand, as we shot that report talking to taxi drivers in Washington, D.C.,
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:25.023]  In New York, you have to pay half a million dollars for a taxi medallion.
[01:09:25.744 --> 01:09:26.965]  Uber drivers aren't paying that.
[01:09:27.725 --> 01:09:31.348]  Uber drivers are not having to get their cars inspected every six months.
[01:09:31.368 --> 01:09:33.130]  They don't have a special...
[01:09:34.568 --> 01:09:37.710]  I'm all for a free market, but what we have here is crony capitalism.
[01:09:53.578 --> 01:09:59.143]  You had companies that were called Jitney Taxi Companies that were tried once upon a time.
[01:09:59.183 --> 01:10:01.646]  These were minority-owned taxi companies.
[01:10:02.527 --> 01:10:17.081]  The professional taxi companies, the unionized taxi companies, whatever you want to call them, the established taxi companies that had the business licenses were reluctant to go into a lot of the minority communities because they thought it was too dangerous or the fares were not lucrative enough.
[01:10:17.751 --> 01:10:21.194]  And so, people in minority communities who didn't have cars needed taxis.
[01:10:21.254 --> 01:10:26.639]  So, a lot of entrepreneurs in the minority communities started what they called Jitney Taxi Companies.
[01:10:26.659 --> 01:10:28.221]  These were unlicensed.
[01:10:28.421 --> 01:10:32.545]  They didn't have all of the regulation that the regular taxi companies did.
[01:10:33.005 --> 01:10:35.107]  And they cracked down on them very hard.
[01:10:35.928 --> 01:10:46.894]  Because, you see, the government wanted to create this symbiotic relationship with the highly regulated taxi companies, with the unions and so forth and so on, to control it, to get a large kickback.
[01:10:47.774 --> 01:10:49.235]  So they didn't want a free market.
[01:10:49.275 --> 01:10:53.337]  But now they're bending out of their way to establish a free market for Uber.
[01:10:54.758 --> 01:10:59.421]  Giving them, essentially, a free market like they cracked down on the Jitney taxi companies.
[01:10:59.461 --> 01:11:00.041]  Why is that?
[01:11:00.922 --> 01:11:05.144]  Well, because Travis Kalanick and Uber and these other companies, but especially Uber,
[01:11:06.283 --> 01:11:07.744]  is set up with the government.
[01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:09.506]  They are operating on the same page.
[01:11:09.566 --> 01:11:16.152]  They want to get rid of private ownership of cars and they understand that Uber is their way to do it.
[01:11:16.813 --> 01:11:20.957]  And of course, Uber is going to get rid of that dude in the car with you.
[01:11:20.977 --> 01:11:21.797]  That's what he said.
[01:11:21.837 --> 01:11:22.918]  That's his words exactly.
[01:11:22.938 --> 01:11:29.825]  He says, once I do that, then my service is going to be incredibly cheap and I will make private ownership of cars go away.
[01:11:30.694 --> 01:11:32.755]  They don't want you to have freedom of movement.
[01:11:32.795 --> 01:11:34.937]  They don't want you to have freedom of transportation.
[01:11:34.997 --> 01:11:38.599]  They want to control and track your movements.
[01:11:39.199 --> 01:11:42.901]  And they're going to do that even if you retain your ownership of your car.
[01:11:42.921 --> 01:11:45.323]  They're going to do that with the equipment that they put in your car.
[01:11:46.198 --> 01:11:51.004]  Because they're going to require that your car talks to all these other cars.
[01:11:51.024 --> 01:11:55.969]  We're only about a year or two away from mandated talking cars.
[01:11:56.089 --> 01:11:58.973]  And when I mean mandated talking cars, they're going to be talking to each other.
[01:11:58.993 --> 01:12:00.675]  It's called vehicle-to-vehicle communication.
[01:12:01.465 --> 01:12:11.050]  And they're going to be communicating with each other, they're going to be communicating to listening stations, they're going to be communicating to the government and to your insurance company to tell them how you're driving.
[01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:17.954]  So they can increase the fines, increase the insurance fees to you, so they can basically price you out of a car.
[01:12:18.934 --> 01:12:21.957]  And say, you know, you don't want any more of these fines, do you?
[01:12:21.997 --> 01:12:28.222]  We'll just get rid of your car and you can drive around in an Uber taxi and then we will control all of your transportation.
[01:12:28.742 --> 01:12:29.723]  So that's where this is going.
[01:12:29.903 --> 01:12:33.206]  This is going to a control grid to track everything that you're doing.
[01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:36.168]  So that's why I don't like the technology.
[01:12:36.749 --> 01:12:40.592]  It isn't going to be presented as an option for you in the long term.
[01:12:41.172 --> 01:12:47.595]  It is going to be presented as a way to push you out of your car, to take away your freedom of movement.
[01:12:48.175 --> 01:12:56.619]  I'm part of the generation, the post-World War II generation, that grew up seeing cars as the essence of individual freedom.
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:00.341]  You know, see the USA in your Chevrolet, there's Dinah Shore singing that.
[01:13:00.401 --> 01:13:01.502]  That's what I grew up with.
[01:13:02.242 --> 01:13:03.303]  That's what we experience.
[01:13:03.323 --> 01:13:05.205]  The kind of freedom that comes from mobility.
[01:13:05.265 --> 01:13:09.469]  The freedom to live in the suburbs or the country if we want to and commute into the city.
[01:13:09.489 --> 01:13:13.573]  But of course, the environmentalists don't like that.
[01:13:13.693 --> 01:13:15.054]  So, you have to get rid of that.
[01:13:15.074 --> 01:13:16.255]  You're going to have to get rid of that car.
[01:13:16.275 --> 01:13:17.276]  We don't like the suburbs.
[01:13:17.316 --> 01:13:18.657]  We don't like urban sprawl.
[01:13:18.717 --> 01:13:20.639]  We don't like all these other factors.
[01:13:20.659 --> 01:13:22.521]  So, we're going to take that choice away from you.
[01:13:22.581 --> 01:13:25.584]  But we're going to do it in the name of something that is benevolent.
[01:13:25.604 --> 01:13:26.825]  Well, it's not really that benevolent.
[01:13:27.896 --> 01:13:34.398]  As you may have heard with the news breaks that we did, there's been some issues with the self-driving updates that were done by Tesla.
[01:13:34.438 --> 01:13:36.199]  Tesla's the first one to actually put this out.
[01:13:36.619 --> 01:13:38.919]  Of course, the equipment is being put in all the cars now.
[01:13:38.979 --> 01:13:45.522]  They had all the equipment put in, the subsystems tested, forward-looking radar and that sort of thing into their car system.
[01:13:45.562 --> 01:13:46.882]  So it was just a software update.
[01:13:46.902 --> 01:13:47.842]  They did it about a week ago.
[01:13:47.902 --> 01:13:53.184]  Now we've already had multiple instances of people putting up on the Internet
[01:13:53.684 --> 01:14:11.929]  Places where this went crazy, and you can see that they're playing some b-roll right there of a Tesla car trying to... The other guy, as he's going along there, if you hear the audio, it's going beep beep beep beep beep, and the car is coming towards him, and the car jerks the wheel into the path of the oncoming car, but he grabs it and pulls it back.
[01:14:11.969 --> 01:14:14.209]  Yeah, let's play the audio on that so people can hear that on the radio.
[01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:16.870]  Go ahead.
[01:14:16.890 --> 01:14:19.511]  I just want to pop up to show up and say brace for impact.
[01:14:21.937 --> 01:14:22.558]  Oh, this is great.
[01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:24.020]  Great technology.
[01:14:24.781 --> 01:14:27.083]  He's driving along, enjoying this technology.
[01:14:27.103 --> 01:14:28.765]  So it's good on the highway.
[01:14:30.427 --> 01:14:32.390]  Now that's a reporter.
[01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:33.231]  Isn't that great?
[01:14:33.271 --> 01:14:38.697]  Now that's not the guy that just had the car try to throw him in the path of the oncoming vehicle.
[01:14:39.397 --> 01:14:51.770]  But as they point on, Tesla comes back and says the latest autopilot release is a hands-on experience to give drivers more confidence behind the wheel, to increase their safety on the road, to make mortal ray driving more enjoyable.
[01:14:52.431 --> 01:14:53.993]  Now look at this and I go, are you kidding me?
[01:14:54.734 --> 01:14:57.216]  Are the people driving these $70,000 to $100,000 automobiles, are these student drivers?
[01:15:01.377 --> 01:15:04.903]  Do they need more hands-on experience to drive down the road and the highway?
[01:15:05.545 --> 01:15:05.905]  Come on!
[01:15:07.047 --> 01:15:08.530]  That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.
[01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:11.395]  The other thing that's ridiculous about this is that Tesla says...
[01:15:12.267 --> 01:15:15.830]  That this is a beta release, and use it at your own risk.
[01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:18.372]  And if you have an accident, you're responsible, not us.
[01:15:18.972 --> 01:15:19.853]  Let me tell you something.
[01:15:20.514 --> 01:15:24.537]  Beta releases for software are one thing, where you crash and lose your data.
[01:15:24.577 --> 01:15:28.440]  But, you know, we're talking about people's lives here being at stake.
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:32.383]  I think they're going to have some criminal liability if they crash this thing.
[01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:38.268]  But just as Anthony Gucciardi pointed out earlier, there's this MIT Technology Review talking yet again.
[01:15:38.288 --> 01:15:39.549]  This just came out yesterday.
[01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:43.690]  Why self-driving cars must be programmed to kill.
[01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:44.570]  Yeah.
[01:15:45.150 --> 01:15:49.431]  We need to solve an impossible ethical dilemma of algorithmic morality.
[01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:51.572]  Algorithmic morality.
[01:15:52.152 --> 01:15:53.232]  Computer morality.
[01:15:53.872 --> 01:15:57.633]  We have abdicated so many things to computers now.
[01:15:58.013 --> 01:16:00.134]  Why not abdicate our morality?
[01:16:00.954 --> 01:16:01.535]  Our choice.
[01:16:02.175 --> 01:16:05.038]  And see, that goes back to what we were talking about in the first hour.
[01:16:05.879 --> 01:16:06.960]  About CISA.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.721]  Just passed in the Senate.
[01:16:08.742 --> 01:16:10.063]  It's already passed in the House.
[01:16:11.024 --> 01:16:12.785]  And of course Obama is going to sign it.
[01:16:13.226 --> 01:16:20.272]  When they turn that information over to the government, you're going to have an algorithm that is going to flag you as a terrorist.
[01:16:21.073 --> 01:16:22.074]  Send out a SWAT team.
[01:16:22.694 --> 01:16:25.156]  Possibly start a prosecution of you.
[01:16:25.596 --> 01:16:33.983]  You're returning everything over to our computers, to the government, and we don't have any freedom that we're restraining for ourselves.
[01:16:34.023 --> 01:16:37.825]  But of course, everybody in the tech business is cheering this on.
[01:16:38.045 --> 01:16:41.048]  Look at the way Wired Magazine puts this out.
[01:16:41.088 --> 01:16:45.491]  Their headline, obviously, drivers are already abusing Tesla's autopilot.
[01:16:46.191 --> 01:16:47.753]  So you see, it's not that
[01:16:48.493 --> 01:16:49.393]  It's a bad idea.
[01:16:49.513 --> 01:16:54.976]  It's not that you shouldn't be beta testing stuff on the streets with human drivers.
[01:16:55.056 --> 01:16:59.258]  No, it's the drivers who are abusing the software program.
[01:16:59.298 --> 01:17:00.278]  Poor software program.
[01:17:00.538 --> 01:17:01.078]  Poor Tesla.
[01:17:01.459 --> 01:17:02.099]  Isn't that a shame?
[01:17:02.519 --> 01:17:06.281]  And of course, one of these people in Miami took a video.
[01:17:06.301 --> 01:17:11.483]  He says that his self-driving car was driving 75 in a 60 mile an hour zone.
[01:17:11.503 --> 01:17:15.765]  He was pulled over by the Florida Highway Patrol and he showed the speeding tickets that he got.
[01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:26.912]  Well, they're going to be giving you speeding tickets all the time, because they're going to have the black box recorders, they're going to have the V2V communication, and they're going to be passing that information on to the highway patrol.
[01:17:26.932 --> 01:17:30.974]  Of course, they won't need highway patrol anymore, but they're going to be passing that information on.
[01:17:31.795 --> 01:17:44.423]  Now, I want to just go back and recall an older article that was out, it was in 2015, it was earlier this year, talking about researchers hacking the same model car.
[01:17:45.592 --> 01:17:51.376]  But of course, they said, don't worry, this is also a Wired Magazine, don't worry, Tesla's already patched that vulnerability.
[01:17:51.997 --> 01:18:00.002]  Well, as long as you've got the capability of a computer driving your car, as long as you've got all these systems that were there, and of course, what did they do?
[01:18:00.343 --> 01:18:10.270]  They hacked a Tesla Model S because it's got all the controls built in there so that you can drive the car, as we just saw with their most recent update.
[01:18:10.650 --> 01:18:19.976]  So, you can get an update that makes the car a self-driving autonomous car, or you can get an update from a hacker that drives you anywhere they want.
[01:18:20.237 --> 01:18:23.138]  Off the cliff, into the side of a mountain, whatever.
[01:18:23.739 --> 01:18:30.183]  You know, when we talked about this with Michael Hastings, everybody said, you crazy conspiracy theorist, nobody could or would do that.
[01:18:31.244 --> 01:18:33.225]  Well, it's... that wasn't that long ago.
[01:18:33.245 --> 01:18:34.686]  That was only a couple years ago.
[01:18:34.726 --> 01:18:37.068]  That was 2013 that Michael Hastings died.
[01:18:37.813 --> 01:18:40.514]  And we said, you know, he was being investigated.
[01:18:40.534 --> 01:18:41.915]  We didn't even know at the time.
[01:18:41.995 --> 01:18:49.018]  It was ridiculous the way they were talking about how the engine had been ejected at a right angle when he crashed into a tree.
[01:18:49.078 --> 01:18:53.681]  They told us he was driving 100 miles an hour, but everybody that knew him said he drove like a granny.
[01:18:54.401 --> 01:18:59.523]  And then it came out that he was being investigated by the FBI.
[01:18:59.583 --> 01:19:04.526]  Of course, we knew that he had made enemies within the military community.
[01:19:05.618 --> 01:19:10.101]  When he was doing reporting, but we knew that we'd learned that he was doing an investigation.
[01:19:10.161 --> 01:19:11.021]  He was on the run.
[01:19:11.081 --> 01:19:13.543]  He told all of his friends, I need to disappear for a while.
[01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:16.765]  And then we see that car crash that happened.
[01:19:16.825 --> 01:19:20.407]  And quite frankly, I don't think that the car blew up when it hit the tree either.
[01:19:20.507 --> 01:19:22.549]  I think there was multiple things involved in my opinion.
[01:19:23.638 --> 01:19:36.542]  Somebody was making that car drive 100 miles an hour, and I think that there was a detonation of a bomb that caused that engine to continue down the same path it was, and then the car came to a relatively gentle rest against a tree.
[01:19:36.782 --> 01:19:38.963]  The gas tank was never involved.
[01:19:39.323 --> 01:19:40.443]  You can see the pictures of it.
[01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:41.784]  It wasn't burning from there.
[01:19:41.804 --> 01:19:45.625]  It was burning from where he was, and it didn't smash into a car.
[01:19:45.665 --> 01:19:47.966]  There's just an article a week or two ago
[01:19:48.206 --> 01:19:51.370]  The same model Mercedes a couple of teenagers were out driving.
[01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:52.111]  They hit a tree.
[01:19:52.552 --> 01:19:53.973]  It cut their car in half.
[01:19:54.113 --> 01:19:55.635]  That didn't happen with Michael Hastings.
[01:19:56.276 --> 01:19:57.818]  That's the potential for abuse.
[01:19:57.898 --> 01:20:04.807]  Yet another example of how if you give this kind of power to the government, to corporations, it can be abused by evil people.
[01:20:04.867 --> 01:20:05.328]  Stay with us.
[01:20:05.648 --> 01:20:06.950]  When we come back, we're going to talk about a
[01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:09.092]  Update on this $750 pill.
[01:20:09.472 --> 01:20:12.355]  Is it a failure of the free market?

[01:21:18.966 --> 01:21:24.149]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[01:21:24.429 --> 01:21:29.051]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[01:21:29.331 --> 01:21:32.553]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.

[01:22:09.304 --> 01:22:12.789]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:13.530 --> 01:22:14.051]  It's true.
[01:22:14.171 --> 01:22:18.137]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:18.317 --> 01:22:20.200]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:25.187]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:25.487 --> 01:22:38.096]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[01:23:16.072 --> 01:23:19.813]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[01:23:20.353 --> 01:23:21.614]  We typically do the same thing.
[01:23:21.734 --> 01:23:24.295]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[01:23:24.775 --> 01:23:26.395]  But have you considered heat storage?
[01:23:26.975 --> 01:23:28.776]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[01:23:29.196 --> 01:23:30.856]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[01:23:31.477 --> 01:23:32.857]  How will I keep my family warm?
[01:23:33.117 --> 01:23:35.578]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[01:23:35.598 --> 01:23:39.659]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[01:23:40.484 --> 01:23:41.204]  Another concern?
[01:23:41.605 --> 01:23:45.267]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[01:23:45.587 --> 01:23:47.848]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[01:23:48.168 --> 01:23:51.370]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[01:23:52.151 --> 01:23:54.592]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[01:23:54.952 --> 01:23:58.915]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[01:23:59.595 --> 01:24:00.936]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[01:24:01.616 --> 01:24:02.897]  FortressClothing.com.
[01:24:03.257 --> 01:24:04.598]  You'll never be cold again.
[01:24:20.382 --> 01:24:21.483]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:21.544 --> 01:24:22.164]  I'm David Knight.
[01:24:22.405 --> 01:24:34.239]  As we were talking in the last segment, when we have bad people, and we will always have bad people in every line of work, it makes it all the more important for us to have a legal framework that protects us all.
[01:24:34.659 --> 01:24:36.081]  That's why we have the Bill of Rights.
[01:24:36.702 --> 01:24:38.864]  And of course, there's good cops and there's bad cops.
[01:24:39.505 --> 01:24:41.866]  We had Frank Serpico talks about that quite a bit.
[01:24:41.926 --> 01:24:46.047]  He says the test of the system is does it protect you from the bad cops?
[01:24:46.267 --> 01:24:47.787]  Can it purge the bad cops?
[01:24:48.328 --> 01:24:50.388]  Look at this story that's up on Infowars.com.
[01:24:50.428 --> 01:24:55.209]  A police officer fined for driving without a license for 25 years.
[01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:56.690]  25 years he didn't have a license.
[01:24:57.915 --> 01:25:02.437]  See, that's the kind of above-the-law attitude that we see frequently.
[01:25:03.178 --> 01:25:05.799]  But let me play something for you that's from a good cop.
[01:25:06.219 --> 01:25:18.686]  This is from the Bradford County Sheriff, Gordon Smith, talking about the Bill of Rights, talking about the protections of our fundamental rights to keep and own arms, talking about open carry in Florida.
[01:25:18.746 --> 01:25:19.306]  Here's this clip.
[01:25:19.786 --> 01:25:26.430]  We have Sheriff Gordon Smith, Bradford County, Sheriff Gordon.
[01:25:29.139 --> 01:25:30.880]  Gordon Smith, Sheriff of Bradford County.
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:33.740]  I'd like to come before you and say thank you for allowing me to speak briefly.
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:36.461]  I had a prepared speech, but I'm going to speak from the heart and keep it short.
[01:25:37.161 --> 01:25:39.182]  I call this Crime Prevention 101 Bill.
[01:25:39.782 --> 01:25:47.664]  Because any law enforcement worth their grain of salt knows that criminals pick soft targets, easy targets, to rob, rape, and pilfer.
[01:25:48.824 --> 01:25:49.805]  Now there's something wrong with that.
[01:25:50.005 --> 01:25:54.466]  Because when they call 9-1-1, they have to have a way to defend themselves between them making that phone call
[01:25:55.478 --> 01:25:56.498]  And the police arriving there.
[01:25:57.659 --> 01:26:02.341]  And I'll tell you this, any crowd I go to, I'd rather know who's got the gun than guessing who's got the gun.
[01:26:03.021 --> 01:26:13.385]  And 790 statute, with the concealed permit that you have to have, says you must display, upon law enforcement officer asking you, your concealed weapons and your driver's license.
[01:26:14.285 --> 01:26:16.586]  So when I see that person carrying a weapon on their side,
[01:26:18.107 --> 01:26:22.350]  One, they've got to have a permit, so that means they're a law-abiding, lawful citizen of the state of Florida.
[01:26:23.770 --> 01:26:29.654]  I believe in the right of a person to protect themselves and their family the way they best feel comfortable.
[01:26:30.234 --> 01:26:31.375]  Some people don't like guns.
[01:26:31.635 --> 01:26:32.375]  I'm okay with that.
[01:26:32.716 --> 01:26:34.256]  Get a can of wasp spray if it works for you.
[01:26:35.237 --> 01:26:37.698]  What I'm telling you is I want to be clear.
[01:26:38.319 --> 01:26:40.000]  There are no factual
[01:26:41.375 --> 01:26:43.997]  Or rational reasons to oppose open carry.
[01:26:44.337 --> 01:26:45.538]  We can what if it to death.
[01:26:46.059 --> 01:26:49.821]  We can give scenarios, but 45 other states give us a model.
[01:26:50.982 --> 01:26:51.783]  Look in those areas.
[01:26:52.563 --> 01:26:58.508]  You can make up all the stories you want to, but there are no factual reasons to oppose.
[01:26:59.549 --> 01:27:04.012]  If you believe in America, our Constitution, and love the people of Florida,
[01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:09.591]  Allow our law-abiding citizens to choose how they protect themselves and their family.
[01:27:10.011 --> 01:27:12.912]  And I will speak as the sheriff representing the heartbeat of Florida.
[01:27:14.012 --> 01:27:16.633]  That's where Bradford County is, right between Jacksonville and Gainesville.
[01:27:18.353 --> 01:27:20.774]  You look around and I can tell you I've been all over this state.
[01:27:20.814 --> 01:27:23.574]  There are some cops with guns that probably don't need them.
[01:27:25.295 --> 01:27:26.975]  I'm gonna speak loud and I'm gonna speak clear about it.
[01:27:27.861 --> 01:27:32.144]  I don't know about my other sheriffs, but I can tell you as Bradford County Sheriff, I go on the record for open carry.
[01:27:32.385 --> 01:27:33.806]  It's the best thing for the state of Florida.
[01:27:33.886 --> 01:27:34.186]  Thank you.
[01:27:34.967 --> 01:27:36.308]  Thank you, Sheriff Gordon.
[01:27:37.048 --> 01:27:37.709]  Well, good for him.
[01:27:37.889 --> 01:27:38.329]  Good for him.
[01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:42.313]  And let me tell you something, and it showed this clip of this article that I have right here.
[01:27:42.973 --> 01:27:49.579]  3D printing used to make a real handgun, handheld railgun, which fires plasma projectiles at 560 miles per hour.
[01:27:49.619 --> 01:27:50.539]  Take a look at that picture.
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:51.940]  See that picture?
[01:27:52.081 --> 01:27:54.483]  That's what's going to happen if you go to gun prohibition.
[01:27:55.506 --> 01:28:01.808]  That's going to be the meth equivalent of the drug war and the gun prohibition wars.
[01:28:02.168 --> 01:28:02.448]  Okay?
[01:28:02.588 --> 01:28:04.849]  People are going to make their own weapons.
[01:28:05.069 --> 01:28:06.970]  They're going to make all kinds of crazy stuff.
[01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:13.772]  You may wind up with a lot more dangerous firearms on the street than you have right now to those of you who are afraid of guns.
[01:28:13.892 --> 01:28:14.732]  Just understand that.
[01:28:15.132 --> 01:28:21.414]  Understand that with alcohol prohibition, we got far more dangerous forms of alcohol after prohibition.
[01:28:21.694 --> 01:28:23.675]  The same thing has happened with the war on drugs.
[01:28:23.715 --> 01:28:24.495]  Things like meth.
[01:28:24.935 --> 01:28:25.996]  That people had not dreamed of.
[01:28:26.516 --> 01:28:30.000]  That is made possible by your prohibition environment.
[01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:36.705]  And so if you want to prohibit firearms, you're going to wind up with things like these homemade 3D printing guns, a rail gun, whatever.
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:47.744]  People are going to use their ingenuity to create whatever they wish, and of course there's going to be a huge, huge profit motive like there is in any black market.
[01:28:48.064 --> 01:28:55.946]  So it's good to see a sheriff like that sheriff there, Bradford County Sheriff Gordon Smith in Florida, speaking in favor of open carry.
[01:28:55.966 --> 01:28:56.787]  I like what he had to say.
[01:28:56.807 --> 01:29:00.888]  He said there's some police officers who shouldn't be owning guns, and that's absolutely true.
[01:29:00.948 --> 01:29:03.569]  We need good people in office.
[01:29:04.009 --> 01:29:06.090]  That's why I've said so many times
[01:29:06.610 --> 01:29:11.080]  Don't focus so much, and to the exclusion of everything else, on the presidential race.
[01:29:11.501 --> 01:29:16.953]  You need to get good people in at the local level, especially at the sheriff's office level.
[01:29:17.864 --> 01:29:27.987]  You need to get people in at the state legislature, at the state house, at the state senate, to make sure that they're going to stand for your rights against any federal incursions.
[01:29:28.027 --> 01:29:30.228]  We have a massive bureaucracy at the federal level.
[01:29:30.628 --> 01:29:44.492]  I don't think most presidential candidates, certainly I don't see anybody on either party that I think is going to be able to stand up and dismantle this massive bureaucracy, at least not without help at the state and local level.
[01:29:44.572 --> 01:29:46.012]  That's why you need to focus there.
[01:29:46.453 --> 01:29:47.473]  However, when we come back,
[01:29:47.853 --> 01:29:53.715]  We're going to talk about what's going on with this massive distraction we call the presidential election.
[01:29:53.795 --> 01:29:54.895]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:29:59.176 --> 01:30:02.177]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.097 --> 01:30:05.778]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.091 --> 01:30:12.193]  Do you know what it means to be an American?
[01:30:12.414 --> 01:30:13.615]  It's more than a flag.
[01:30:13.895 --> 01:30:16.578]  It's more than knowing the star-spangled banner.
[01:30:16.758 --> 01:30:18.140]  It's knowing the Constitution.
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:21.243]  It's understanding those rights and fighting for them.
[01:30:21.444 --> 01:30:24.607]  Our country is falling apart because people have forgotten to fight.
[01:30:24.767 --> 01:30:27.931]  To stand up in the face of tyranny and do the right thing.
[01:30:28.251 --> 01:30:33.255]  It's putting your life on the line to protect your country from enemies both foreign and domestic.
[01:30:33.375 --> 01:30:41.022]  The Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and no government should refuse or rest on inference.
[01:30:41.562 --> 01:30:46.566]  So the Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[01:30:47.387 --> 01:30:51.871]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com, and I believe our flag is more than cloth and ink.
[01:30:52.311 --> 01:30:55.013]  It is a symbol that stands for liberty and freedom.
[01:30:55.393 --> 01:31:00.057]  It is a history of our nation, and it's marked by the blood of those who died defending it.
[01:31:00.537 --> 01:31:02.238]  So join me in this Infowar.
[01:31:02.278 --> 01:31:06.722]  Turn off your TV, put your Cheetos down, get off your butt and join the resistance.
[01:31:10.077 --> 01:31:13.680]  As any regular listener knows, I don't script what I have to say.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:18.444]  I do my research, and then I tell it like it is, and let the chips fall where they may.
[01:31:18.584 --> 01:31:19.845]  And I'm gonna do that right now.
[01:31:20.346 --> 01:31:25.750]  I have never, in my 20 years on air, seen a time where it's more important to be prepared.
[01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:30.534]  Even most mainline analysts are now saying, we've entered this critical juncture.
[01:31:30.714 --> 01:31:32.295]  We've got to get prepared.
[01:31:32.536 --> 01:31:35.318]  Everyone knows I'm obsessed with win-win situations.

[01:32:51.393 --> 01:32:54.596]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:32:54.876 --> 01:32:56.678]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:32:56.858 --> 01:32:57.739]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:32:57.759 --> 01:32:58.739]  It doesn't have garbage in it.

[01:33:18.570 --> 01:33:22.714]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:23.494 --> 01:33:24.936]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:33:33.638 --> 01:33:34.979]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:34.999 --> 01:33:35.980]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:33:36.641 --> 01:33:42.105]  Yesterday, Alex talked to a scientist about his newest water filter.
[01:33:42.606 --> 01:33:49.071]  This is Dr. Evan Koslow he talked to about the Alexa Pure Pro that we're now carrying at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:33:49.531 --> 01:33:54.716]  A very interesting and a bit different approach to gravity feed water filters.
[01:33:55.116 --> 01:33:59.119]  Here's a partial video of that interview yesterday.
[01:33:59.139 --> 01:34:01.782]  Break down why you're so proud of these filters.
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:07.821]  Well, I mean, the Alexa Pure is really a culmination of all of my experience.
[01:34:07.981 --> 01:34:11.642]  It was posed to me as an extremely challenging project.
[01:34:12.342 --> 01:34:17.663]  They wanted a product that would actually operate without any electricity, so you had no pressure.
[01:34:18.024 --> 01:34:19.364]  You had to do it all by gravity.
[01:34:19.824 --> 01:34:27.606]  And they really effectively said, we need everything imaginable to be removed efficiently, way higher than 99%.
[01:34:29.136 --> 01:34:32.177]  And so the result was it's an extreme challenge.
[01:34:32.737 --> 01:34:41.940]  I worked on it for quite a long time and basically what we've done is we created the only filter to my knowledge that hits all three.
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:49.863]  It will remove effectively all the major metals, all the major non-metals such as fluoride.
[01:34:50.263 --> 01:34:55.645]  It will take out all known microbiological threats including viral, bacterial and cysts.
[01:34:56.423 --> 01:35:02.485]  And it will take out organic chemicals of pretty much everything, without exception.
[01:35:02.525 --> 01:35:04.485]  It's a very, very powerful device.
[01:35:05.126 --> 01:35:10.127]  I don't believe that there's anything else out there in the world that can do that, especially under gravity flow conditions.
[01:35:10.527 --> 01:35:12.288]  The fit and finish are fantastic.
[01:35:12.368 --> 01:35:16.009]  No compromise was made on the quality of the construction.
[01:35:17.073 --> 01:35:24.138]  So, I mean, it's really a remarkable achievement on their part, and I feel very proud, actually, to be part of the team that put that together.
[01:35:24.699 --> 01:35:26.480]  What's your view overall on fluoride?
[01:35:27.241 --> 01:35:36.307]  Well, okay, so we actually tested against both the fluoride ion and the fluorosilicate that you mentioned, which is the additive that people put into water under federal control.
[01:35:36.847 --> 01:35:40.650]  And basically, we removed both of them with equal efficiency.
[01:35:41.050 --> 01:35:46.294]  So, we wanted to be sure that no matter how fluoride is added to the water, it can be intercepted and removed.
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:48.781]  So that's how we've dealt with that.
[01:35:49.081 --> 01:35:57.827]  All I can tell you is that we tested against all known fluoride chemicals that are added to water, the new ones and the old ones, and we removed them all of equal efficiency.
[01:35:57.947 --> 01:36:03.110]  And it's your belief that this is the best gravity-fed filter of the design out there available to the public?
[01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:04.411]  Without a doubt.
[01:36:04.631 --> 01:36:09.394]  I mean, most of these gravity flow filters are at best simple particulate filters.
[01:36:09.813 --> 01:36:12.514]  They remove dirt and debris, sediment.
[01:36:13.135 --> 01:36:19.838]  They're not going to be capable of intercepting a viral particle to the degree, we're talking quantitative reduction below detection.
[01:36:20.078 --> 01:36:21.839]  No one can touch that kind of capability.
[01:36:21.999 --> 01:36:26.641]  Well, I'm impressed and I want to thank you so much for your time today.
[01:36:26.661 --> 01:36:31.804]  It is the Alexa Pure Pro family of water filtration systems available.
[01:36:32.924 --> 01:36:36.585]  Discount exclusively at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:36:37.205 --> 01:36:40.966]  I want to thank Mr. Redhawk for allowing us to be part of the launch of this.
[01:36:41.766 --> 01:36:44.426]  It's on sale right now for their main unit, $177.
[01:36:44.786 --> 01:36:47.467]  Leading competitors that aren't even as good or more than that.
[01:36:47.907 --> 01:36:57.789]  They've also got the survival spring type straw system for survival that is an absolute must-have.
[01:37:00.686 --> 01:37:08.588]  Okay, and again, that is the new Alexa Pure Pro filter, and that is available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:09.028 --> 01:37:11.589]  It's a gravity-fed water filtration system.
[01:37:12.269 --> 01:37:18.511]  It'll filter out bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:37:19.031 --> 01:37:20.372]  That is something that is very important.
[01:37:20.592 --> 01:37:21.252]  You know, if you're
[01:37:21.932 --> 01:37:24.396]  If you're in the city, there's a lot of things that you have to worry about.
[01:37:24.416 --> 01:37:26.159]  You have to worry about fluoride.
[01:37:26.179 --> 01:37:29.344]  You have to also worry about things like chlorine in your drinking water.
[01:37:29.624 --> 01:37:31.988]  You want to get that filtered out before you drink it.
[01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:45.610]  But if you're in the country, as I am, I also want to make sure that I get things like agricultural runoff, things like glyphosate, things like hormones that they're feeding the agricultural, that they're feeding the animals, that sort of thing.
[01:37:45.730 --> 01:37:48.532]  I want to make sure that I don't have that in my groundwater.
[01:37:48.932 --> 01:37:49.653]  So we use that.
[01:37:49.693 --> 01:37:56.698]  And one of the things I like about this, I'm going to pick up one of these, because it has a filter capacity of 5,000 gallons.
[01:37:57.079 --> 01:38:00.001]  That's an amazing amount of time that filter is going to last.
[01:38:00.041 --> 01:38:00.922]  And again, as he pointed out,
[01:38:01.582 --> 01:38:05.064]  That is something that you want to have if you've got a power-down situation.
[01:38:05.084 --> 01:38:13.869]  You don't want to lose your water filtration system like you would with some of these reverse osmosis filters or something that require electricity to operate.
[01:38:13.909 --> 01:38:16.971]  You want to have something that's very simple, that is gravity-fed.
[01:38:17.011 --> 01:38:19.292]  Again, you can get that at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:38:19.613 --> 01:38:22.194]  That is the Alexa Pure Pro Filter.
[01:38:22.474 --> 01:38:24.415]  That's the gravity-fed water filter.
[01:38:24.695 --> 01:38:30.339]  Brand new filter, and that was the scientist who designed it that Alex was talking to yesterday, Dr. Evan Koslow.
[01:38:31.465 --> 01:38:34.668]  Now I want to talk about something that I think is very important.
[01:38:34.969 --> 01:38:41.315]  We spend a lot of time talking about the presidential race, and it's important to understand where the people are going.
[01:38:41.355 --> 01:38:50.805]  As I've mentioned before, you need to think nationally, think globally, understand where the agendas are, understand who the players are, but still act locally as much as you can.
[01:38:51.986 --> 01:39:03.456]  A clip from a sheriff in Florida who was very much pro-gun, a strong advocate for people having open carry, speaking at a city council meeting where he was sheriff.
[01:39:03.476 --> 01:39:06.919]  It's important to get people like that in office locally.
[01:39:06.939 --> 01:39:10.341]  They're going to have a lot of power to protect your rights.
[01:39:10.682 --> 01:39:13.844]  So get those people in, work with them, identify those kinds of people.
[01:39:14.365 --> 01:39:17.848]  But understand too, that if we want to try to
[01:39:18.468 --> 01:39:22.330]  Divide and conquer the federal government, and that's one of the things that we need to be working at.
[01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:23.871]  That was the founders design, you know.
[01:39:24.571 --> 01:39:33.956]  When I talk about the presidential race, when I talk about the speaker race, I had somebody send me a note on Twitter and said, do you really need a leader to save you and protect you, David?
[01:39:33.976 --> 01:39:35.596]  And it's like, no, I certainly don't.
[01:39:36.457 --> 01:39:39.378]  But they understand how powerful divide and conquer is.
[01:39:40.219 --> 01:39:42.720]  And we need to divide and conquer the federal government.
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:46.503]  That's what the founders who wrote the Constitution were concerned about.
[01:39:46.743 --> 01:39:58.113]  You understand that they divided the federal government into three opposing parts, and they also divided power between the federal government, the state, and the people.
[01:39:58.914 --> 01:40:06.801]  People having things like elections, which they've now rigged, but also things like jury nullification, which we need to take back the understanding of.
[01:40:07.403 --> 01:40:11.745]  There are different mechanisms that people would have to directly affect their freedom.
[01:40:12.366 --> 01:40:19.810]  And so we need to understand that the founders were concerned more than anything about the consolidation of power into the center.
[01:40:20.530 --> 01:40:25.313]  So they divided that power between the federal, state, and local, and people.
[01:40:26.053 --> 01:40:28.194]  And they also divided the federal government itself.
[01:40:28.334 --> 01:40:33.337]  And now, though, we have a situation where there's been a consolidation in Washington.
[01:40:34.082 --> 01:40:40.983]  One of the things that we can do is to try to make sure that we don't have a monolithic leadership in Washington.
[01:40:41.484 --> 01:41:02.108]  That is, that all of the leaders of both parties, whether it's in Congress or whether it's the President or whether it's even the Supreme Court, which we don't have any direct election control of, but we need to make sure that the people who are in the Presidency at least and in the Congress are not all working toward the same unified goals.
[01:41:03.117 --> 01:41:03.857]  How do we do that?
[01:41:04.217 --> 01:41:11.461]  Well, we do it by getting rid of people like John Boehner, who is on the same page as Nancy Pelosi on the really big issues.
[01:41:11.801 --> 01:41:30.249]  The big issues that are going to completely alter our economy, completely alter our sovereignty, our national borders, open borders, the new trade agreements that are being negotiated that they tell us have been finished, but here we are weeks after they tell us they've been finished, they still won't show them to us.
[01:41:31.673 --> 01:41:41.540]  Now, as Boehner is stepping down, we had Kevin McCarthy that he offered, and Kevin McCarthy stepped down, so Boehner said, that's it, we're not going to have the election until I get somebody that I like.
[01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:48.124]  Well, it looks like the person he wants is Paul Ryan, or I think we ought to call him Paul Ryan-o, because he is a rhino.
[01:41:48.965 --> 01:41:52.648]  And we see that the White House, the White House likes Paul Ryan-o.
[01:41:53.493 --> 01:41:54.675]  Why do they like Paul Reino?
[01:41:55.215 --> 01:42:04.828]  Well, the President says he believes Congressman Reino is someone who has given considerable thought to the significant issues that must be worked through in Congress.
[01:42:05.649 --> 01:42:10.436]  And the White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said this specifically.
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:21.570]  They singled him out for working with the administration to grant the Obama administration Trans-Pacific Trade Authority and his efforts to work with them on open borders.
[01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:22.251]  You see?
[01:42:23.112 --> 01:42:30.138]  They can have their differences, they can keep up this facade of the left-right paradigm, but when it comes to
[01:42:30.919 --> 01:42:32.180]  What they're really after.
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:33.661]  They have a common agenda.
[01:42:33.681 --> 01:42:40.264]  Whether you're talking about the Democrat leadership or the Republican leadership, they want a consolidation of global governance.
[01:42:40.725 --> 01:42:49.810]  Senator Sessions, who took the time to look at the agreement, said, we're creating a transnational institution here with these treaties.
[01:42:50.799 --> 01:42:55.264]  That we'll be able to write this without our approval, without any further involvement from us.
[01:42:55.304 --> 01:43:01.131]  And of course it's going to be presented to the Congress and they will not be allowed to make any amendments or any changes.
[01:43:01.171 --> 01:43:02.412]  It'll be a straight up or down vote.
[01:43:02.773 --> 01:43:03.814]  It'll be accelerated.
[01:43:03.834 --> 01:43:10.141]  They'll bypass all the usual processes that would stop a bill possibly from getting through.
[01:43:11.042 --> 01:43:14.445]  That's something that Paul Ryan has already worked with the White House to make sure is going to happen.
[01:43:14.485 --> 01:43:16.767]  That was the Trade Promotion Authority, the TPA.
[01:43:17.187 --> 01:43:24.313]  And of course with that in place, they can get the TPP, the TTIP, the TISA, the Trade and Services Agreement.
[01:43:24.833 --> 01:43:29.257]  So there's all these different agreements that can be put in for the next six years.
[01:43:29.697 --> 01:43:38.345]  Because people like Paul Ryan worked with the Obama administration to make sure that we didn't have a constitutional process to approve treaties.
[01:43:38.991 --> 01:43:44.115]  And we know that once this treaty is approved, from what Senator Sessions told us, they can change anything about the treaty that they want to.
[01:43:44.796 --> 01:43:45.436]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:43:45.897 --> 01:43:48.219]  They can add anybody into the treaty that they want to as well.
[01:43:48.419 --> 01:43:51.141]  We're told we have to have this because we need protection from China.
[01:43:51.161 --> 01:43:54.064]  Well, China could be added the day after they approve this treaty.
[01:43:54.284 --> 01:43:55.725]  China could be added to the TPP.
[01:43:56.566 --> 01:43:58.147]  And they could change anything about it.
[01:43:58.447 --> 01:44:03.411]  And of course, it's going to create, it's going to elevate the corporations who wrote this
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:05.602]  to the level of government.
[01:44:05.622 --> 01:44:08.606]  Of course, they're already really above government because they're the ones who wrote it.
[01:44:08.646 --> 01:44:11.090]  They're the ones who are telling our senators that they can't talk about it.
[01:44:11.150 --> 01:44:19.021]  So we need somebody like Paul Ryan who is going to toe the line that Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner have been doing.
[01:44:19.662 --> 01:44:31.925]  And of course, they have shown that they don't really care for the process either, because one of the ways that you ram this through, just like we see with these trade agreements, you want to make sure that you don't have to go through the constitutional process of setting up a treaty.
[01:44:32.206 --> 01:44:43.789]  And when you're somebody operating as Speaker, like Nancy Pelosi did, like John Boehner did, you want to make sure that you don't get encumbered by all the constitutional requirements, all the legal requirements to get a bill passed.
[01:44:44.602 --> 01:44:51.147]  You just want to make people do what you say and punish them if they don't do that, because that could delay their agenda.
[01:44:51.928 --> 01:44:57.772]  So we have a tyranny that is being run by people, the leadership of both parties are not really very different.
[01:44:58.112 --> 01:45:03.937]  Again, to illustrate this again, we have two House Democrats, one from California, one from New York, saying they support Paul Ryan.
[01:45:04.477 --> 01:45:07.518]  Nancy Pelosi has kind of indirectly thrown her support to him.
[01:45:07.998 --> 01:45:26.263]  We see Pew polling, however, saying that at least 93% of the GOP electorate opposes Paul Ryan on immigration because he has been open borders for his entire career, going all the way back to the point when he was a staffer working for Jack Kemp.
[01:45:27.003 --> 01:45:30.164]  And of course, even Ann Coulter came out and said,
[01:45:31.598 --> 01:45:38.201]  You know, he's part of the Kemp Boys, because that's where he got his start in politics, working for Jack Kemp.
[01:45:38.221 --> 01:45:40.081]  This is a story that was on the Drudge Report.
[01:45:40.401 --> 01:45:42.802]  Save us from Paul Ryan and the Kemp Boys.
[01:45:42.842 --> 01:45:54.527]  She says, by now there's been approximately a million studies on the effects of Jack Kemp's Enterprise Zones, of his Empowerment Zones, and of Obama's version, the Promise Zones.
[01:45:54.907 --> 01:45:56.928]  The conclusion, every single penny has been wasted.
[01:45:57.688 --> 01:46:06.256]  Businesses game the system, they relocate shops from just outside the zone to just within it, or they take tax credits for doing nothing that they weren't already planning to do.
[01:46:06.316 --> 01:46:09.840]  The principal result of Kemp's enterprise zones was to double HUD's budget.
[01:46:10.521 --> 01:46:12.442]  So that's where Paul Ryan got his start.
[01:46:12.482 --> 01:46:17.767]  But of course, Jack Kemp and others were also about open borders and open immigration.
[01:46:18.348 --> 01:46:22.032]  And this isn't something about any particular demographic group.
[01:46:23.103 --> 01:46:27.004]  We see that it's different demographic groups that are being used in Europe as well.
[01:46:27.924 --> 01:46:30.585]  It's all about the Cloward and Piven strategy.
[01:46:31.265 --> 01:46:37.527]  We see that Sweden is on the verge of economic collapse because they've had massive immigration for a number of years.
[01:46:37.567 --> 01:46:41.108]  We see that rape in Sweden is at epidemic proportions.
[01:46:41.848 --> 01:46:47.650]  One out of four women in Sweden, they believe, are going to be, statistically, will be raped.
[01:46:48.670 --> 01:47:08.729]  And yet, I think it's kind of ironic that even with that kind of statistic, that you've got Julian Assange, they're coming after him for an alleged rape in Sweden of all places, where they tolerate this, they won't change the policies for open borders, even though 25% of the women are likely to get raped there, based on their statistics.
[01:47:09.269 --> 01:47:15.956]  They won't do anything about open borders to change that, but they will spend years surrounding Julian Assange.
[01:47:16.136 --> 01:47:22.021]  They will spend millions of dollars trying to capture him out of the Ecuadorian embassy there.
[01:47:23.001 --> 01:47:24.982]  And of course we know that that was just a setup.
[01:47:25.463 --> 01:47:29.005]  We know that was because he blew the whistle on criminal actions by the government.
[01:47:29.346 --> 01:47:31.527]  Nevertheless, that's the open border issue.
[01:47:32.448 --> 01:47:36.591]  To have global governance, they have to destroy individual national sovereignty.
[01:47:37.372 --> 01:47:39.273]  They have to turn it into an illusion.
[01:47:39.293 --> 01:47:47.979]  And of course, Paul Ryan said, as many Democrats have said, America isn't really so much a physical country as it is just an idea.
[01:47:48.871 --> 01:47:51.553]  And of course, he's changing what's behind that idea.
[01:47:52.113 --> 01:48:03.641]  Now the saddest thing about this is that the House Freedom Caucus, which we've been told is going to be the, as the Washington Post puts it, the hardline conservatives, it looks like they're not taking a hard line anymore.
[01:48:04.241 --> 01:48:11.486]  Looks like they're not going to fight against this kind of dictatorial speakership that we've seen from the Republican and Democrat leadership.
[01:48:12.026 --> 01:48:21.754]  They're not going to fight against someone who is a full-out, open globalist, who wants open borders, who wants this corporate trade agreement that's being pushed through.
[01:48:22.574 --> 01:48:26.998]  No, they're saying they're going to possibly support Paul Ryan.
[01:48:28.158 --> 01:48:33.062]  Except for a few, like Louie Gohmert, who says he is not going to support him.
[01:48:33.643 --> 01:48:37.666]  And of course, Paul Ryan's conditions for doing this is that they cannot throw him out.
[01:48:38.306 --> 01:48:43.448]  He wants them to get rid of the very motion that is being used to push out John Boehner.
[01:48:43.928 --> 01:48:45.429]  The vacate the chair motion.
[01:48:45.469 --> 01:48:47.690]  He wants that taken off the table.
[01:48:48.010 --> 01:48:51.311]  He's not going to make any promises about what he will do to conservatives.
[01:48:51.371 --> 01:48:57.074]  And of course, the reason that the conservatives are pushing back on this is like I just pointed out.
[01:48:57.094 --> 01:49:00.595]  93% of the GOP voters oppose Paul Ryan on open borders.
[01:49:00.655 --> 01:49:02.396]  That's what he has defined himself on.
[01:49:03.783 --> 01:49:05.424]  And the GOP voters don't like that.
[01:49:05.464 --> 01:49:11.389]  That's why the GOP voters voted in a majority in the GOP and yet they betrayed them.
[01:49:12.090 --> 01:49:14.372]  And so it really is a test at this moment.
[01:49:14.872 --> 01:49:19.876]  Is there anyone in Washington left who is going to pay any attention to the voters?
[01:49:21.177 --> 01:49:24.700]  That's the thing you need to keep in mind when you look at the presidential election.
[01:49:25.558 --> 01:49:33.617]  They want you to focus strictly and solely on the presidential election, as if electing one guy is going to change everything for you.
[01:49:34.474 --> 01:49:35.174]  It simply isn't.
[01:49:35.475 --> 01:49:43.459]  And you have to understand, when you look at the promises that these people are making, that they have carefully crafted their position papers, for the most part.
[01:49:43.499 --> 01:49:50.923]  You'll see that they're talking about exactly the same issues in exactly the same ways, whether they're Republicans or Democrats.
[01:49:50.983 --> 01:49:58.588]  They've got the Republican issues, they've got the Democrat issues, and they're talking to the voters with these consultants that have put this together.
[01:49:58.628 --> 01:50:00.549]  They're selling, they're closing the deal.
[01:50:01.249 --> 01:50:04.191]  That's why I'm concerned about Donald Trump, as I've said many times.
[01:50:04.231 --> 01:50:06.432]  He's got some great position papers that he's put out there.
[01:50:06.653 --> 01:50:10.935]  I don't agree with everything that's in the position papers, but he's put out very detailed position papers.
[01:50:10.955 --> 01:50:20.202]  The question is, do you think you can trust him to deliver on these position papers, or is he just closing a deal with you?
[01:50:21.082 --> 01:50:21.983]  Take a look at this article.
[01:50:22.424 --> 01:50:25.807]  Donald Trump's speeches are at 4th grade levels, says a study.
[01:50:26.408 --> 01:50:29.591]  And I looked at that and I thought, I'm surprised that it's that high.
[01:50:29.611 --> 01:50:33.575]  I guess it shows how far educational standards have dropped since I've been in elementary school.
[01:50:33.995 --> 01:50:38.940]  They go on and say that Bernie Sanders comes in at the highest level when they test these things out.
[01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:40.902]  They say he comes in at a 10th grade level.
[01:50:40.922 --> 01:50:44.425]  This is according to a Fleischer-Kincaid readability test.
[01:50:45.126 --> 01:50:51.829]  They say that Abraham Lincoln was at an 11th grade level and the founders like George Washington were postgraduate.
[01:50:51.869 --> 01:50:54.349]  They were at the 17th grade level.
[01:50:55.350 --> 01:51:01.072]  I guess that's why people don't understand the basic principles of individual liberty anymore.
[01:51:01.612 --> 01:51:04.913]  Maybe they lost them when they lost their vocabulary.
[01:51:04.953 --> 01:51:07.414]  But it's a deliberate dumbing down in our educational system.
[01:51:07.694 --> 01:51:08.155]  Stay with us.
[01:51:08.375 --> 01:51:09.035]  We'll be right back.

[01:51:42.196 --> 01:51:42.917]  Another shooting.
[01:51:43.317 --> 01:51:44.578]  And they're getting worse.
[01:51:45.038 --> 01:51:48.241]  That's why Infidel Body Armor introduces Infidel Fridays.

[01:54:24.028 --> 01:54:25.169]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:28.171]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Friday, October 23rd, 2015.
[01:54:28.372 --> 01:54:38.680]  I was going to continue on with some presidential candidate updates, but I think I'm going to take a diversion here as we're talking about open borders and open immigration with Paul Ryan.
[01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:43.564]  I want you to understand, I want you to contact your congressman.
[01:54:43.784 --> 01:54:49.828]  I want you to put some backbone in them because this is something that is going to happen before the presidential race.
[01:54:50.689 --> 01:54:54.152]  This is nearly as important as the presidential race.
[01:54:54.252 --> 01:54:59.296]  If you think the presidential race is important, this is the person who is third in line in power.
[01:54:59.596 --> 01:55:02.899]  After the President, the Vice President, the Speaker of the House would become President.
[01:55:02.959 --> 01:55:04.140]  So it's a very high office.
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:06.361]  There's a lot of power in that office.
[01:55:06.661 --> 01:55:07.902]  There's power to make change.
[01:55:08.803 --> 01:55:11.345]  And there's power to make change in a very bad way.
[01:55:11.365 --> 01:55:14.286]  And that's the way Paul Ryan is going to use that power.
[01:55:14.326 --> 01:55:16.668]  We've already seen that he is for open borders.
[01:55:16.688 --> 01:55:26.874]  We've already seen that he is for enacting massive, sovereignty-destroying trade agreements without doing the treaty process that's in the Constitution.
[01:55:27.414 --> 01:55:29.355]  And I want you to take a look at how this works.
[01:55:29.375 --> 01:55:30.496]  Who mentions Sweden?
[01:55:30.856 --> 01:55:31.597]  Look at this headline.
[01:55:31.657 --> 01:55:36.180]  Sweden almost triples refugee estimates as their system buckles.
[01:55:37.210 --> 01:55:38.450]  Remember we talked about Cloward and Piven?
[01:55:39.251 --> 01:55:47.053]  That is a couple of socialists who said, we can remake our society, but first we need to destroy it.
[01:55:47.113 --> 01:55:48.033]  You always hear that, right?
[01:55:48.053 --> 01:55:54.856]  Of course, that was a line that Robert Redford's character had in the Captain America movie.
[01:55:54.876 --> 01:55:58.477]  He said, we're going to destroy the system so we can rebuild it the way we want it.
[01:55:59.599 --> 01:56:00.900]  We had a couple of socialists said that.
[01:56:00.961 --> 01:56:04.424]  We want a socialist system, so let's do a couple of things.
[01:56:04.484 --> 01:56:11.552]  Number one, we will create huge entitlement programs and then we'll expand the number of people that qualify for those entitlement programs.
[01:56:11.773 --> 01:56:14.836]  One of the ways that you do that is by opening up the borders completely.
[01:56:14.856 --> 01:56:18.921]  So that's being done to Europe, it's being done to North America at the same time.
[01:56:19.381 --> 01:56:21.663]  And we see that it is now having the effect where?
[01:56:22.143 --> 01:56:25.726]  The place where you have the largest socialist welfare states.
[01:56:26.186 --> 01:56:27.047]  Sweden, for example.
[01:56:27.227 --> 01:56:28.948]  They're the first ones to start buckling.
[01:56:29.409 --> 01:56:32.711]  And they're buckling under the weight of this uncontrolled open border.
[01:56:33.031 --> 01:56:43.159]  You cannot support a system where everybody can come to your country and get a free education, free housing, all these other entitlements that people are putting out there.
[01:56:43.179 --> 01:56:45.421]  We're going to talk about Bernie Sanders.
[01:56:45.461 --> 01:56:48.123]  I think we need to start calling him Bernie Sanders-nista.
[01:56:49.329 --> 01:57:02.719]  He had a video, and we're going to talk about that a little bit, back in 1985 where he had gone down to Nicaragua and looked at the socialist paradise that was being created there by the Sandinistas, and he had nothing but good things to say about it.
[01:57:02.739 --> 01:57:10.164]  So we're going to look at what Bernie Sanders had to say in 1985 about the Sandinistas, and we're going to see how Bernie Sandinista
[01:57:11.496 --> 01:57:19.697]  Failed to realize what was really going on there and still, 30 years later, doesn't understand what's going on with socialism.
[01:57:19.757 --> 01:57:20.678]  He's still clueless.
[01:57:21.678 --> 01:57:22.798]  But take a look at this as well.
[01:57:23.278 --> 01:57:26.779]  Sweden on the verge of collapse as illegal immigrants surge into the country.
[01:57:26.839 --> 01:57:30.319]  And of course that was an article on Infowars.com from Kurt Nemo.
[01:57:30.939 --> 01:57:32.300]  And then look at this article.
[01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:37.640]  We had a Swedish school killer posed for a photo midway through a murder spree.
[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:39.161]  Now this is a guy goes into a school.
[01:57:39.641 --> 01:57:40.421]  He doesn't have a gun.
[01:57:41.181 --> 01:57:43.082]  But he's got a mask and a sword.
[01:57:43.883 --> 01:57:55.411]  And he's chopping people up in the school, but in between, as he's going from classroom to classroom, he stops, and because he's got a mask and he's got a sword with some blood on it, the students thought that it was fake blood.
[01:57:55.431 --> 01:57:59.353]  They thought it was kind of cool, so they actually posed with him for pictures.
[01:58:00.334 --> 01:58:02.195]  You know how they stopped this guy?
[01:58:03.136 --> 01:58:03.916]  He was shot.
[01:58:04.657 --> 01:58:05.478]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:58:06.458 --> 01:58:06.858]  Maybe
[01:58:08.392 --> 01:58:12.874]  Maybe we should have mask control and sword control, right?
[01:58:12.934 --> 01:58:13.994]  That's what the liberals would say.
[01:58:14.775 --> 01:58:18.516]  Isn't it interesting that he was stopped by someone with a gun?
[01:58:18.756 --> 01:58:21.917]  He was stopped by the school police who shot him with a gun.
[01:58:22.658 --> 01:58:24.538]  Yeah, see, that's the whole point.
[01:58:25.339 --> 01:58:30.621]  When you've got somebody who's got a sword or somebody who's just bigger than you are, especially if you're a woman,
[01:58:31.221 --> 01:58:33.623]  That's the way you equalize things, is with a gun.
[01:58:34.003 --> 01:58:37.505]  Guns can be used to defend people, not just to attack people.
[01:58:37.946 --> 01:58:43.269]  That's what that situation in Sweden shows, and we can see Cloward and Piven operating, unfortunately, throughout their society.
[01:58:43.569 --> 01:58:44.050]  Stay with us.
[01:58:44.310 --> 01:58:47.912]  When we come back, we're going to cover more news, and we're going to talk about Bernie Sanders.
[01:58:48.132 --> 01:58:56.398]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:59.870 --> 01:59:09.795]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high-quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at HDFirearms.com.
[01:59:09.995 --> 01:59:15.957]  One of the most exciting things about HDFirearms.com is the ability to upgrade your AR-15 platform today.
[01:59:16.117 --> 01:59:18.258]  They call it their low-profile platform.

[01:59:20.079 --> 01:59:21.720]  Proven to help control muzzle rise.
[01:59:23.041 --> 01:59:25.583]  6061 billet material with Type 3 hard coating.

[01:59:51.021 --> 01:59:52.282]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:15.936 --> 02:00:20.121]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:20.782 --> 02:00:21.583]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.364 --> 02:00:23.265]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.285 --> 02:00:27.551]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.091 --> 02:00:32.157]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.744 --> 02:00:36.105]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:36.125 --> 02:00:37.246]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[02:00:37.987 --> 02:00:39.948]  Again, we have a couple of key articles.
[02:00:40.429 --> 02:00:44.032]  Iceland has now sent 26 corrupt bankers to prison.
[02:00:44.052 --> 02:00:45.733]  You'll find that on Infowars.com.
[02:00:46.394 --> 02:00:54.441]  As well as Silicon Valley experts suggest using pop-ups to shame people who are making offensive posts.
[02:00:55.141 --> 02:00:57.023]  Hey, did you know you're being racist right now?
[02:00:57.163 --> 02:00:57.783]  Things like that.
[02:00:58.484 --> 02:01:00.044]  That's what they're wargaming.
[02:01:00.604 --> 02:01:05.445]  And of course, that is a part of the shaming society.
[02:01:05.965 --> 02:01:08.766]  That's what makes people like Donald Trump so popular.
[02:01:09.266 --> 02:01:12.407]  The fact that he's pushing back against this kind of political correctness.
[02:01:12.727 --> 02:01:17.108]  We all understand by now that it is a tool of social control.
[02:01:17.768 --> 02:01:21.629]  We all understand by now that the computers are a tool of social control.
[02:01:21.889 --> 02:01:23.789]  The internet is a tool of social control.
[02:01:24.582 --> 02:01:35.011]  We also need to understand that everything that we're doing, just as these Silicon Valley experts are pointing out, they are watching everything that you are typing, everything that you're doing on the computer, as you're doing it, in real time.
[02:01:35.491 --> 02:01:38.374]  That information is now going to be shared with the government.
[02:01:39.115 --> 02:01:41.517]  The Senate passed CISA today.
[02:01:43.361 --> 02:01:58.186]  83 senators voted to approve information sharing and give legal protection to the corporations that turn your private information that they're collecting about you, turn that over to the government without you being able to take any legal action against that.
[02:01:58.906 --> 02:02:00.047]  So now it's been formalized.
[02:02:00.687 --> 02:02:05.249]  Google, Facebook, all of them, they are collecting information for the NSA.
[02:02:05.309 --> 02:02:12.251]  They're collecting it for the government, which will then take a look at it in the same kind of ways that these Silicon Valley experts are suggesting.
[02:02:12.967 --> 02:02:17.570]  Take a look at it and say, well, you know, I think that I don't like what you're typing here.
[02:02:18.310 --> 02:02:21.092]  So it may be a lot more insidious than a pop-up.
[02:02:21.132 --> 02:02:23.253]  You may not get a pop-up on your screen.
[02:02:23.293 --> 02:02:27.696]  What you may have is a pop-up of a SWAT team at your house.
[02:02:28.096 --> 02:02:30.117]  Because that's the way they're going to use this information.
[02:02:30.538 --> 02:02:31.839]  That's what we need to be aware of.
[02:02:32.762 --> 02:02:45.009]  You need to understand that when they talk about people who are being racist, people who they talk about being extremists, people that they need to track using this information sharing, they're going to track radical extremists.
[02:02:45.069 --> 02:02:50.872]  And when people in America look at that, they say, oh, you mean those radical jihadis who want to chop people's heads off.
[02:02:52.206 --> 02:02:53.227]  No, not really.
[02:02:53.267 --> 02:02:54.867]  That's not the way it's being used in Europe.
[02:02:55.588 --> 02:03:07.493]  We just had, a week or two ago, the Strong Cities Network announced at the United Nations, along with the Department of Justice and the current Attorney General, and that's coming out of Europe.
[02:03:07.793 --> 02:03:09.574]  It's coming from a think tank in Europe.
[02:03:09.614 --> 02:03:12.315]  They're going to be the ones who are going to be monitoring that.
[02:03:13.086 --> 02:03:17.527]  And they're going to be looking at what they call dangerous radical extremists.
[02:03:17.607 --> 02:03:21.429]  And let me tell you who they think the dangerous radical extremists are.
[02:03:21.489 --> 02:03:23.889]  Straight out of the Southern Poverty Law Center playbook.
[02:03:24.710 --> 02:03:25.710]  Except it's coming from Europe.
[02:03:25.790 --> 02:03:30.011]  There, it's anybody who is anti-immigration, anti-Islam.
[02:03:31.191 --> 02:03:37.633]  See, when they're talking about radical extremists, they're not talking about the people who run around chopping heads off.
[02:03:37.713 --> 02:03:37.993]  No.
[02:03:38.654 --> 02:03:42.695]  The radical extremists are the people who are afraid or concerned about that.
[02:03:44.164 --> 02:03:45.845]  That's what they're going to be using this for.
[02:03:45.905 --> 02:03:48.926]  That's what the Strong Cities Network is about, what the United Nations is.
[02:03:48.986 --> 02:03:59.329]  It's targeting people who are opposed to the open borders like Paul Ryan and Obama and Boehner and Pelosi and the rest of them are feeding us.
[02:04:00.009 --> 02:04:02.590]  And of course we can include in that group Bernie Sanders.
[02:04:02.690 --> 02:04:11.554]  Bernie Sanders has just hired a DREAMer as one of his, the person who's going to be doing the outreach to Hispanic voters.
[02:04:11.614 --> 02:04:14.755]  This is a person who came here, he's an illegal immigrant.
[02:04:15.815 --> 02:04:18.937]  He is a DREAMer, he helped to organize the DREAM organizations.
[02:04:18.977 --> 02:04:27.100]  He went to school in New York and he went to pass the bar and they said, wait a minute, you can't be on the bar here in New York, you're not a citizen.
[02:04:27.912 --> 02:04:30.095]  And then they thought better about it and they said, nah, that's alright.
[02:04:30.735 --> 02:04:34.640]  You don't have to be, you don't have to actually respect the law in New York to be a lawyer.
[02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:36.442]  So now we've formalized that.
[02:04:36.482 --> 02:04:39.165]  We all kind of, we all kind of suspected that, didn't we?
[02:04:39.205 --> 02:04:41.608]  Anybody that's had any kind of dealings with the legal system.
[02:04:41.949 --> 02:04:43.490]  But they formalized that and said no.
[02:04:44.631 --> 02:04:48.672]  You can be a lawyer and have absolutely no respect for whatever laws you don't like.
[02:04:48.792 --> 02:04:50.673]  So they made him part of the bar.
[02:04:50.933 --> 02:04:54.674]  He then helped to set up the Dreamers group.
[02:04:55.094 --> 02:04:59.256]  And now he is going to be Bernie Sanders outreach to Latino voters.
[02:04:59.616 --> 02:05:00.836]  Stay with us when we come back.
[02:05:00.916 --> 02:05:05.278]  We're going to talk about Bernie Sandernista and his outreach to the Nicaraguans.
[02:05:05.838 --> 02:05:06.378]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:09.796 --> 02:05:16.339]  After the release of numerous videos showing questionable Planned Parenthood practices, multiple facilities have been raided.
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:28.166]  Reuters reports, Texas officials raided several Planned Parenthood facilities on Thursday, in a move that comes days after the state's Republican leaders barred the women's health group from receiving state Medicaid money.
[02:05:28.406 --> 02:05:36.410]  The Inspector General's office declined to comment, but its agents were seen on local news reports entering a Planned Parenthood facility in San Antonio.
[02:05:36.770 --> 02:05:50.701]  Texas said it would launch a probe of Planned Parenthood after the release of videos in July by an anti-abortion activist group, Center for Medical Progress, in which a Planned Parenthood official is seen talking about transactions involving fetal tissue.
[02:05:51.121 --> 02:05:55.745]  And speaking on a personal note, Planned Parenthood continues to say that the videos were edited.
[02:05:55.965 --> 02:06:00.888]  Which they were, much like you would edit a State of the Union address down to a few soundbites.
[02:06:00.968 --> 02:06:03.629]  But that doesn't mean that they were taken out of context.
[02:06:03.930 --> 02:06:07.672]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[02:06:09.562 --> 02:06:15.006]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.

[02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:56.543]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[02:07:56.703 --> 02:07:58.844]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[02:07:59.024 --> 02:08:05.989]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:08:15.618 --> 02:08:20.501]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:08:21.141 --> 02:08:23.843]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:26.904 --> 02:08:28.105]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:28.145 --> 02:08:28.725]  I'm David Knight.
[02:08:28.806 --> 02:08:32.267]  On this October 23rd, 2015, I'll be your host today.
[02:08:33.208 --> 02:08:40.772]  Again, in the fourth hour, we're going to have a Planned Parenthood whistleblower, Abby Johnson, join us in the fourth hour.
[02:08:40.832 --> 02:08:41.513]  We just had
[02:08:42.113 --> 02:08:44.415]  Planned Parenthood get very concerned.
[02:08:44.435 --> 02:08:47.618]  They tried to stop the raw footage from being released.
[02:08:47.658 --> 02:08:57.386]  Remember they said that the footage from the Planned Parenthood clinics showing them conspiring to get baby parts, conspiring to do partial birth abortions.
[02:08:57.406 --> 02:09:00.569]  They said, oh, that's heavily edited, that's not really true, that's dishonest.
[02:09:00.609 --> 02:09:08.556]  Well, the House Committee that was investigating it, because they're looking at possibly cutting the funding for this kind of activity, they said, send us the raw footage.
[02:09:09.318 --> 02:09:16.084]  So this abortion group, this federation, this abortion federation said, we are going to stop you.
[02:09:16.124 --> 02:09:21.429]  They got an injunction to stop that from being released to the public.
[02:09:21.949 --> 02:09:24.351]  Nevertheless, it was leaked by a staffer.
[02:09:24.872 --> 02:09:26.693]  You would think that if it really was
[02:09:27.972 --> 02:09:28.312]  I think so.
[02:09:49.764 --> 02:09:58.053]  Also breaking in news on Infowars.com, Iceland has now sent 26 corrupt bankers to prison, 74 years of sentences, and this is for high-level people.
[02:09:58.654 --> 02:09:59.795]  This is not people at the bottom.
[02:10:00.316 --> 02:10:09.987]  They say this brings to 26 bankers now behind bars in Iceland, with most being CEOs of large financial institutions rather than low-level traders.
[02:10:11.052 --> 02:10:12.833]  Let me read you what Iceland's president said.
[02:10:13.453 --> 02:10:17.975]  He said, why are banks considered to be the holy churches of the modern economy?
[02:10:18.495 --> 02:10:25.457]  Why are private banks not like airlines and telecommunication companies and allowed to go bankrupt if they've been run in an irresponsible way?
[02:10:26.118 --> 02:10:31.780]  The theory that you have to bail out banks is a theory that you allow bankers to enjoy
[02:10:33.127 --> 02:10:36.670]  Is a theory that you allow bankers to enjoy for their own profit, for their own success.
[02:10:37.231 --> 02:10:42.175]  Then you let ordinary people bear their failure through taxes and austerity.
[02:10:42.935 --> 02:10:47.199]  People in enlightened democracies are not going to accept that in the long run.
[02:10:47.599 --> 02:10:57.387]  And then he added, we were wise enough, talking about Iceland, we were wise enough not to follow the traditional prevailing orthodoxies of the Western financial world in the last 30 years.
[02:10:57.467 --> 02:10:58.788]  We introduced currency controls.
[02:10:58.808 --> 02:10:59.749]  We let banks fail.
[02:11:00.209 --> 02:11:01.870]  We provided support for the poor.
[02:11:01.930 --> 02:11:06.392]  We didn't introduce austerity measures like you're seeing in Europe.
[02:11:07.093 --> 02:11:13.056]  But again, in this article, I point out, Congress gave American banks a $700 billion bailout.
[02:11:13.096 --> 02:11:13.716]  That was TARP.
[02:11:13.917 --> 02:11:14.417]  Remember that?
[02:11:15.137 --> 02:11:17.979]  Do you remember when the Obama administration
[02:11:19.070 --> 02:11:28.142]  They gave a pass to HSBC when they were caught money laundering after they had been, for a second time, had already been put on probation, being caught doing it.
[02:11:28.182 --> 02:11:29.244]  They caught them a second time.
[02:11:29.564 --> 02:11:35.352]  They gave them a small slap on the wrist, a very small fine that amounted to a couple of days profits, a few days profits.
[02:11:36.013 --> 02:11:42.399]  But of course, they said at the time, it wouldn't really do us any good to pull this bank's charter, and it wouldn't be in the public interest to do that.
[02:11:42.979 --> 02:11:45.041]  We wouldn't want to put anybody in jail for that.
[02:11:45.061 --> 02:11:46.342]  That wouldn't be in the public interest.
[02:11:46.362 --> 02:11:54.529]  And everybody said, oh, in Eric Holder's Department of Justice, in the Obama administration, bankers are too big to jail.
[02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:59.072]  They're not only too big to fail, like we saw with TARP, but they're too big to jail.
[02:11:59.813 --> 02:12:08.618]  And we subsequently learned that HSBC even had its own dedicated window for money laundering for the Sinaloa cartel.
[02:12:08.638 --> 02:12:13.060]  Remember all this panic about El Chapo escaping from prison?
[02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:15.262]  He was the guy who was head of the Sinaloa cartel.
[02:12:15.862 --> 02:12:21.005]  And HSBC gave them their own private window to launder money.
[02:12:22.580 --> 02:12:24.340]  Nothing in the United States to be done about that.
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:27.821]  And of course, let's understand that the Republicans aren't going to be any better.
[02:12:27.861 --> 02:12:31.502]  This is not something that is simply an Obama administration issue.
[02:12:31.662 --> 02:12:37.584]  Yes, Eric Holder had his position with his cronies on Wall Street.
[02:12:37.624 --> 02:12:41.685]  They kept his desk for him and he went right back to the law firm that worked for these big banks.
[02:12:42.105 --> 02:12:46.288]  Yes, I know that's true, but it's also true on the Republican side as well.
[02:12:46.688 --> 02:12:52.092]  They're not going to put these guys in jail, but they did in Iceland, and that's the way you stop it.
[02:12:52.533 --> 02:13:02.941]  See, if you don't prosecute the bad people, whether they're people in the NSA, or whether they're people in the State Department like Hillary Clinton, or whether they're the big bankers, if you don't
[02:13:03.721 --> 02:13:10.504]  When people break the law, if you don't punish them, if you don't purge that out of the system, the system owns it.
[02:13:11.004 --> 02:13:13.785]  The system itself becomes corrupt.
[02:13:14.185 --> 02:13:15.466]  And that's the problem that we have now.
[02:13:15.526 --> 02:13:26.530]  We have massive, massive corruption in the United States because of the people at top who are allowing this, who are enabling this, because they will not take any action against people.
[02:13:27.010 --> 02:13:29.131]  Fortunately, in Iceland, they are doing it.
[02:13:29.411 --> 02:13:32.012]  And one of the reasons that works is because it's a small country.
[02:13:33.007 --> 02:13:35.009]  Because the government is closer to the people.
[02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:44.437]  And again, if we're going to continue to think that we are going to reform Washington from the inside, I think that is delusional.
[02:13:44.817 --> 02:13:47.900]  It is going to have to be done from the outside if it's done at all.
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.844]  It may be too late to get it done, but we have to try to cut it off on the outside.
[02:13:52.864 --> 02:13:59.310]  We have to try to get control of the smaller, controllable blocks and exercise our constitutional authority.
[02:14:00.287 --> 02:14:09.094]  Now, I want to talk about Bernie Sanders and this 1985 video that has surfaced about him going to South America.
[02:14:09.134 --> 02:14:14.378]  Before I do, real quickly, I want to let you know that we have 15% off of Ancient Defense for a limited time.
[02:14:14.859 --> 02:14:20.984]  Right now at Infowarslife.com, you can get the highly rated Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Complex for 15% off.
[02:14:21.444 --> 02:14:26.849]  It combines more than 14 different herbs and extracts to help bolster the body's natural defenses.
[02:14:27.509 --> 02:14:34.571]  This super high quality nutraceutical is already very affordable, but now you can try it yourself and get it for just 15% off.
[02:14:35.211 --> 02:14:37.531]  It's a huge savings right now and it is in stock.
[02:14:37.571 --> 02:14:40.292]  Again, let me read you a couple of the reviews that we have on our site.
[02:14:40.312 --> 02:14:43.492]  It's a good way to see if these supplements are for you.
[02:14:43.532 --> 02:14:46.493]  You can see how other people are using them, the kind of results that they've gotten.
[02:14:46.753 --> 02:14:48.253]  Here's a couple for Ancient Defense.
[02:14:48.434 --> 02:14:51.994]  KK in Burbank, California said, I'm a disabled combat veteran.
[02:14:52.034 --> 02:14:55.095]  I've been getting good results since you started selling this supplement.
[02:14:55.595 --> 02:15:00.398]  Another one is Billy Bob from Ponce PR.
[02:15:00.418 --> 02:15:02.659]  I'm not sure where that... I'm not sure where PR is.
[02:15:02.699 --> 02:15:03.640]  But anyway, Puerto Rico.
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:04.340]  That's Puerto Rico.
[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:07.182]  Says, I've tried many so-called products for years.
[02:15:07.402 --> 02:15:11.164]  None of the others are as pure and as strong as Ancient Defense.
[02:15:11.204 --> 02:15:15.086]  So again, you can take a look at the reviews on our sites for all of our products.
[02:15:15.546 --> 02:15:18.168]  And again, Ancient Defense is 15% off at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:15:21.775 --> 02:15:42.129]  As we're talking about the bankers ignoring the laws and getting away with it, as we're talking about them being able to rig the LIBOR market, being able to launder money for drug dealers, for terrorist organizations, as HSBC was doing, and get away with it because they're too big to jail, that is a kind of corruption that destroys the country.
[02:15:43.168 --> 02:15:47.691]  But it's also a kind of corruption that can destroy the country at the bottom level as well.
[02:15:47.791 --> 02:15:52.295]  If we ignore the law at every level, then it really does destroy the country.
[02:15:52.315 --> 02:16:01.522]  A good example of this, I think, is Bernie Sanders' new campaign manager, one of his, not campaign manager, but his outreach manager to the Latino vote.
[02:16:02.322 --> 02:16:05.263]  This is someone whose name is Cesar Vargas.
[02:16:05.863 --> 02:16:15.507]  He is an illegal alien who went to school and became a lawyer, got a law degree in New York, and then he applied for the bar and they said, no, you can't be a lawyer in New York.
[02:16:16.603 --> 02:16:22.566]  You're not a citizen in New York, and you have thumbed your nose at the immigration laws your entire life.
[02:16:23.146 --> 02:16:24.447]  Not applied to become a citizen?
[02:16:24.467 --> 02:16:27.248]  You're not trying to follow the rules when it comes to that?
[02:16:27.288 --> 02:16:30.069]  Why should we let you be a lawyer?
[02:16:30.710 --> 02:16:33.111]  Well, he said, that's racist, I guess.
[02:16:33.171 --> 02:16:38.133]  Whatever he told them, they then repeal that, and they admitted him to the bar.
[02:16:39.531 --> 02:16:44.715]  Here's a guy who is not even a legal citizen, but they admitted him to the bar.
[02:16:45.335 --> 02:16:50.599]  So, when you own that kind of corruption, it shows itself in many different ways.
[02:16:50.859 --> 02:16:52.080]  This is another way, for example.
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:57.163]  Amnesty beneficiaries could claim more than $35,000 in tax benefits in the first year.
[02:16:57.183 --> 02:16:59.385]  Remember the story from earlier this year, Breitbart?
[02:17:00.225 --> 02:17:02.247]  This is all the way back in February.
[02:17:03.288 --> 02:17:10.650]  And that was the IRS saying, you know, we're going to let you file for previous years, and they don't really follow that too closely.
[02:17:10.730 --> 02:17:17.631]  They document in this article massive instances of fraud have been documented by people filing false claims.
[02:17:18.031 --> 02:17:23.432]  But essentially what that does is offer financial incentive for people to come here from outside of the country.
[02:17:23.972 --> 02:17:30.894]  Say, not only can you come here, but we're going to give you up to $35,000 in back tax benefits.
[02:17:30.934 --> 02:17:32.114]  Just file some paperwork.
[02:17:33.074 --> 02:17:34.836]  And you'll be able to vote.
[02:17:35.357 --> 02:17:39.060]  You can vote for Hillary or Bernie, depending on which one of them you like, I guess.
[02:17:40.021 --> 02:17:48.469]  And that's the way you take down countries, because you cannot keep the country running if you have an entitlement program and open borders.
[02:17:48.930 --> 02:17:50.772]  Either one of those can destroy a country.
[02:17:51.252 --> 02:17:53.895]  Both of them together will destroy a country very quickly.
[02:17:55.265 --> 02:18:00.993]  And you know, earlier in the show we were talking about the CISPA passing in the Senate.
[02:18:01.353 --> 02:18:09.965]  Bernie Sanders, to his credit, was one of only two senators running for president that worked against CISA.
[02:18:10.866 --> 02:18:11.967]  The other being Rand Paul.
[02:18:12.972 --> 02:18:18.497]  I agree with Bernie Sanders on that, and I agree with what he said when he went to Nicaragua about our foreign policy.
[02:18:18.537 --> 02:18:20.358]  Remember what was happening at the time?
[02:18:20.378 --> 02:18:21.359]  We had Iran-Contra.
[02:18:21.379 --> 02:18:28.825]  We had Ronald Reagan and Oliver North selling weapon parts to Iran because they had our state-of-the-art fighter jets.
[02:18:28.845 --> 02:18:33.189]  They needed spare parts, so they were secretly selling them parts using that money
[02:18:33.849 --> 02:18:39.594]  To run a covert war that they didn't want to get congressional approval from in Central America.
[02:18:39.674 --> 02:18:44.358]  Running a war against the Sandinistas, the communists in Nicaragua.
[02:18:45.019 --> 02:18:51.304]  Also, funding that by running the crack cocaine trade that Gary Webb exposed and Dark Alliance.
[02:18:52.205 --> 02:19:00.152]  So, that was a lot of very evil policies by the Reagan administration, by the CIA, by Oliver North.
[02:19:01.516 --> 02:19:06.818]  And at the time, as this stuff was starting to come out, people like Bernie Sanders were very upset about that.
[02:19:06.878 --> 02:19:09.519]  Many other people that weren't socialists were upset about that.
[02:19:09.599 --> 02:19:16.962]  But just because these guys were acting as criminals doesn't mean that the Sandinistas were good guys either.
[02:19:18.242 --> 02:19:19.383]  They were horrible.
[02:19:19.723 --> 02:19:30.327]  As a matter of fact, the guy that Bernie goes down to take a look at eventually is driven out of office by a coalition of libertarians, conservatives, and communists.
[02:19:31.363 --> 02:19:32.925]  The communists even threw him out.
[02:19:33.766 --> 02:19:41.955]  When he was taken out of office, Daniel Ortega, at the beginning of his communist revolution, had taken a lot of private property.
[02:19:41.975 --> 02:19:47.581]  They'd taken billions of dollars worth of private property from individuals as well as corporations.
[02:19:48.642 --> 02:19:52.766]  Days before he left office, being thrown out by even communists,
[02:19:53.507 --> 02:19:56.011]  He decided that taking private property wasn't a good idea.
[02:19:56.071 --> 02:19:57.993]  He was going to make it private again.
[02:19:58.154 --> 02:20:00.817]  Except it became his private property.
[02:20:00.958 --> 02:20:02.860]  His and his fellow conspirators.
[02:20:03.121 --> 02:20:07.527]  When we come back, we're going to look at what Bernie Sandinista said about Daniel Ortega.
[02:20:10.553 --> 02:20:17.737]  NuMana, the true pioneer of healthy storable foods and preparedness products, has gone and done it again.
[02:20:18.297 --> 02:20:25.121]  NuMana is now the first food storage company in the country to offer organic powdered milk, free of hormones.

[02:20:33.525 --> 02:20:36.006]  Aspartame or artificial ingredients.

[02:21:25.854 --> 02:21:30.398]  Even most mainline analysts are now saying we've entered this critical juncture.
[02:21:30.558 --> 02:21:32.158]  We've got to get prepared.

[02:22:06.415 --> 02:22:07.656]  Atmospheric aluminum.
[02:22:07.676 --> 02:22:08.457]  Mercury exposure.
[02:22:12.421 --> 02:22:22.428]  Estrogen toxins from plastics, microwaves from cell phones and smart meters, and low-quality foods all combine to create conditions for the very high incidence of disease in our society.
[02:22:22.749 --> 02:22:31.135]  Now more than ever, we all need to be consuming those foods and herbs that epigenetically signal the cells of our body to produce energy, create proteins, and detoxify.
[02:22:31.275 --> 02:22:36.879]  When we properly support our bodies, then even in these toxic times we can promote and achieve excellent health.

[02:22:39.881 --> 02:22:40.481]  I think so.
[02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:14.771]  Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day.
[02:23:15.011 --> 02:23:18.773]  And the home security industry wants you to believe that's your only option.
[02:23:19.033 --> 02:23:24.234]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[02:23:24.514 --> 02:23:29.116]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[02:23:29.416 --> 02:23:32.637]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.
[02:23:32.937 --> 02:23:34.998]  But there's a better way to protect your home.

[02:24:16.014 --> 02:24:19.578]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:19.638 --> 02:24:24.222]  I'm David Knight and I want to play for you this clip that surfaced from 30 years ago.
[02:24:25.223 --> 02:24:32.149]  Bernie Sandinista who went to Nicaragua and this is his impression of the Sandinistas.
[02:24:32.169 --> 02:24:33.651]  Let's play this clip and we'll comment on it.
[02:24:34.702 --> 02:24:41.228]  As a socialist, the word socialism does not frighten me, and I think it's probably fair to say that the Nicaraguan government is primarily a socialist government.
[02:24:41.628 --> 02:24:44.270]  How do you find the sincerity of Sandinista leaders?
[02:24:44.810 --> 02:24:45.411]  I was impressed.
[02:24:45.751 --> 02:24:51.576]  Now, obviously, I will be attacked by every editorial writer in the free press for being a dumb duke.
[02:24:52.156 --> 02:24:52.697]  Maybe I am.
[02:24:54.518 --> 02:24:57.081]  I was impressed by their intelligence and by their sincerity.
[02:24:57.121 --> 02:24:58.662]  These are not political hacks, you know?
[02:24:59.844 --> 02:25:01.105]  These are not political hacks, you know?
[02:25:01.745 --> 02:25:01.985]  Yeah.
[02:25:02.425 --> 02:25:03.226]  They're not political.
[02:25:03.246 --> 02:25:06.587]  And he's going to tell you how he knows they're not political hacks.
[02:25:06.627 --> 02:25:08.028]  I'm going to play this next clip for you.
[02:25:09.328 --> 02:25:14.951]  And it basically boils down to the way Bernie Sanders identifies with these people.
[02:25:15.571 --> 02:25:19.513]  And I have to tell you that that's what's behind the support for Bernie Sanders.
[02:25:20.094 --> 02:25:24.796]  People who like Bernie Sanders because he seems to be like them.
[02:25:25.336 --> 02:25:26.697]  They're not looking at his policies.
[02:25:26.897 --> 02:25:32.641]  They're not looking at what the policies have done to places like Nicaragua that he thought was such a great idea.
[02:25:32.661 --> 02:25:35.102]  30 years on, we can see what happened in that country.
[02:25:35.122 --> 02:25:36.243]  It's got a long history.
[02:25:36.563 --> 02:25:38.264]  We can look at how socialism failed there.
[02:25:38.585 --> 02:25:43.648]  We can look at how it failed in the Soviet Union, in China, everywhere else that it's been tried.
[02:25:43.688 --> 02:25:45.229]  But of course, it's going to be different now.
[02:25:45.609 --> 02:25:47.911]  Bernie calls it democratic socialism.
[02:25:47.931 --> 02:25:52.914]  But let's play the rest of this clip about how he knows that these people are not political hacks.
[02:25:54.056 --> 02:25:58.598]  I was impressed by Father Descoteau, and he is a very gentle, very loving man.
[02:25:58.618 --> 02:25:59.858]  He's familiar with Burlington, Vermont.
[02:25:59.878 --> 02:26:01.339]  He had a niece who graduated from St.
[02:26:01.379 --> 02:26:04.940]  Michael College, actually, who's now working for the government.
[02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:06.661]  And he's gentle.
[02:26:06.761 --> 02:26:07.881]  Ortega is an impressive guy.
[02:26:09.682 --> 02:26:11.803]  Ernesto Cardinal is a funny-looking guy.
[02:26:11.823 --> 02:26:12.563]  He's grey-haired.
[02:26:13.063 --> 02:26:14.484]  And he really does remind you of a hippie.
[02:26:14.644 --> 02:26:15.745]  I mean, Ernesto... And in fact,
[02:26:18.474 --> 02:26:21.217]  You know, he's very strongly into poetry.
[02:26:22.479 --> 02:26:31.488]  He is very proud of the fact that they are now teaching poetry, not only to peasants and to workers, but in the military, in the police department.
[02:26:32.209 --> 02:26:33.390]  A very impressive guy.
[02:26:33.891 --> 02:26:35.893]  Yeah, yeah, you know, he's got this white hair.
[02:26:35.913 --> 02:26:37.114]  He's kind of like a hippie, you know?
[02:26:37.134 --> 02:26:39.556]  He's kind of like Bernie Sanders 30 years later!
[02:26:40.495 --> 02:26:42.859]  Kind of like Doc from Back to the Future.
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:45.543]  Except he hasn't been to the future.
[02:26:45.563 --> 02:26:48.068]  He hasn't learned anything in the past 30 years, unlike Doc.
[02:26:50.307 --> 02:26:52.608]  Okay, we're still using the same old playbook.
[02:26:53.088 --> 02:26:55.529]  And the amazing thing about it is, you hear what he said about poetry?
[02:26:55.569 --> 02:26:56.610]  You know, these guys are great.
[02:26:56.670 --> 02:26:57.971]  I mean, he's an old guy.
[02:26:58.871 --> 02:26:59.911]  He's a gentle man.
[02:27:00.612 --> 02:27:01.872]  He looks like a hippie.
[02:27:02.453 --> 02:27:06.775]  There's somebody that I know that went to school in Vermont that's working for him.
[02:27:07.235 --> 02:27:09.656]  All of this is about personal identification.
[02:27:10.116 --> 02:27:13.878]  There's absolutely no discernment about the policies that are there.
[02:27:14.338 --> 02:27:20.722]  And of course, Daniel Ortega, as I mentioned in the last segment, he did a massive, it was basically a massive kleptocracy.
[02:27:20.742 --> 02:27:23.203]  It wasn't even about socialism.
[02:27:23.383 --> 02:27:25.364]  I mean, he wasn't a political hack.
[02:27:25.504 --> 02:27:32.648]  Okay, he was thrown out by not only conservatives, but communists who threw him out of the government there in Nicaragua.
[02:27:33.589 --> 02:27:39.432]  And look at his ally that he made common cause with, the other revolutions in Central America.
[02:27:39.492 --> 02:27:41.213]  Look at Venezuela, Hugo Chavez.
[02:27:42.216 --> 02:27:52.577]  Remember, it was about a year ago that Bloomberg was bragging about the fact that Wall Street, the people that Bernie Sanders loves to talk about, Bernie Sanders will talk about Wall Street, but he won't talk about the Federal Reserve.
[02:27:53.456 --> 02:28:05.520]  But when he talks about Wall Street, he doesn't mention the fact that Hugo Chavez's communist, socialist Venezuela paradise that he loves so much, gave 700% return on investment to the Wall Street bankers.
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:16.464]  And they were bragging on Bloomberg about how these guys, these guys here, they understand that their first responsibility is to the bankers, to their sovereign debt to the bankers.
[02:28:17.125 --> 02:28:21.086]  That's why the people have to go to another country to get food, water, and medicine.
[02:28:21.186 --> 02:28:29.590]  That was in the very same article that they're talking about the fact that they are giving them a 700% return on investment in that same Bloomberg article.
[02:28:29.870 --> 02:28:32.351]  They're talking about the privation of the people.
[02:28:32.771 --> 02:28:34.032]  That is socialism.
[02:28:34.352 --> 02:28:36.333]  Eventually you run out of other people's money.
[02:28:36.473 --> 02:28:38.314]  Eventually you run out of the lies.
[02:28:38.694 --> 02:28:41.815]  And 30 years on, Bernie Sanders still can't see this.
[02:28:42.436 --> 02:28:46.978]  He was infatuated by these guys because they looked like hippies, they taught poetry.
[02:28:47.458 --> 02:28:49.339]  I mean, we were laughing about this.
[02:28:49.699 --> 02:28:59.343]  My son, Travis, who works here, he said, yeah, it makes me feel better if the police can spout poetry to me while they're beating me, you know, for their communist revolution.
[02:28:59.403 --> 02:29:03.344]  I mean, the police and the military were being taught poetry by this guy?
[02:29:04.245 --> 02:29:08.786]  I'm sure that it was mandatory, just like Mao's cultural revolution.
[02:29:09.507 --> 02:29:10.627]  That's precisely the problem.
[02:29:10.647 --> 02:29:12.708]  Let's look at some of the economic policies as well.
[02:29:13.595 --> 02:29:17.218]  We're told that we're going to solve all this by increasing the minimum wage.
[02:29:17.759 --> 02:29:19.440]  Well, you know, we have this article here.
[02:29:20.441 --> 02:29:21.663]  Goodbye, middle class.
[02:29:21.683 --> 02:29:23.524]  This is by Michael Schneider.
[02:29:23.724 --> 02:29:25.886]  51% of all American workers make less than $30,000 a year.
[02:29:25.946 --> 02:29:27.468]  38% of them make less than $20,000 a year.
[02:29:30.891 --> 02:29:38.035]  When you look at things like the Obamacare mandate, everything for the Bernie Sanders socialists is anti-choice.
[02:29:38.235 --> 02:29:39.216]  Everything is a mandate.
[02:29:39.396 --> 02:29:42.398]  Everything must be run by government, including things like health care.
[02:29:42.938 --> 02:29:50.923]  And so what they do is, they charge the poorest people not a 2.5% penalty, but they charge the people making minimum wage a 5% penalty.
[02:29:51.283 --> 02:29:52.524]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:29:59.181 --> 02:30:02.166]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.186 --> 02:30:05.791]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.932 --> 02:30:16.595]  Hillary Clinton will testify in front of the Benghazi committee, and of course, she's going to try and spin this as just partisan politics.
[02:30:16.876 --> 02:30:18.016]  But let's look at the facts.
[02:30:18.336 --> 02:30:18.997]  They lied.
[02:30:19.257 --> 02:30:29.182]  One of the first moves the Obama administration made after the Benghazi attack was to contact YouTube in an apparent attempt to blame the attack on an obscure Pastor John video.
[02:30:29.342 --> 02:30:32.724]  This is according to State Department documents obtained by Judicial Watch.
[02:30:33.064 --> 02:30:41.448]  Later, the administration famously claimed the attack was provoked by another YouTube video, Innocence of Muslims, made by an Egyptian-born filmmaker.
[02:30:41.788 --> 02:30:50.352]  While they were plotting an enormous lie on the public, former Navy SEAL David Ubin was still trapped on the roof of the Benghazi annex for 20 hours.
[02:30:50.852 --> 02:30:55.034]  The Obama administration later jailed the filmmaker behind Innocence of Muslims.
[02:30:55.434 --> 02:31:01.077]  In fact, he was the only man who's been captured and imprisoned in the aftermath of the Benghazi terrorist attack.
[02:31:01.457 --> 02:31:03.943]  What difference at this point does it make?

[02:33:03.816 --> 02:33:05.937]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:25.771 --> 02:33:27.031]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:27.091 --> 02:33:28.112]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[02:33:28.752 --> 02:33:31.493]  You may have been following Leanne McAdoo.
[02:33:31.513 --> 02:33:43.537]  She just began a liver flush and she's been posting some videos about her experience with that as well as some information about some recipes that she's using to make her healthier.
[02:33:43.657 --> 02:33:45.758]  She's in pretty good shape, but she's getting healthier.
[02:33:46.318 --> 02:33:52.620]  We had Dr. Group in talking to Alex Jones recently about LiverShield, which can help you with that process.
[02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:56.281]  Here's a video of that interview, some excerpts from that interview.
[02:34:06.663 --> 02:34:22.066]  And when you eat all these toxins, if you ate McDonald's nuggets 20 years ago that had plasticizers in them, your gallbladder and your liver doesn't know what to do, so the liver basically excretes that into the gallbladder and it holds it.
[02:34:23.237 --> 02:34:28.339]  Just Google gallbladder stones, and it's disgusting, but you need to look at it.
[02:34:29.879 --> 02:34:34.501]  And when you finally get filled up with these, it bursts, or it gets infected, and they've got to remove it.
[02:34:36.021 --> 02:34:37.022]  And we'll scroll through these.
[02:34:37.042 --> 02:34:38.042]  There's even grosser ones.
[02:34:38.542 --> 02:34:39.422]  Like, let's scroll down.
[02:34:39.823 --> 02:34:41.503]  On average, they're green or black.
[02:34:41.903 --> 02:34:44.004]  If they're black, they're really old and toxic.
[02:34:46.105 --> 02:34:47.245]  They're generally green.
[02:34:48.466 --> 02:34:52.387]  And this stuff's meant to be passed out at you, but we eat such artificial food,
[02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:54.460]  That it doesn't.
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:56.902]  These are way beyond kidney stones, you name it.
[02:34:56.942 --> 02:34:58.342]  You also have liver stones.
[02:35:01.064 --> 02:35:04.706]  And medical doctors won't tell you, on average, hey, flush your liver.
[02:35:05.266 --> 02:35:06.707]  They'll just say, hey, your liver's sick.
[02:35:07.247 --> 02:35:08.528]  It's going to get progressively worse.
[02:35:08.548 --> 02:35:10.629]  We're going to get you on a list for a liver transplant.
[02:35:13.731 --> 02:35:14.671]  It is unbelievable.
[02:35:14.691 --> 02:35:16.352]  We're showing these disgusting images.
[02:35:16.372 --> 02:35:22.936]  So, about a year and a half ago, Anthony Gucciardi just said, man, I just did a Dr. Grimm's liver cleanse, the one he recommends.
[02:35:24.127 --> 02:35:27.612]  And he's developing this proprietary stuff he's testing on himself right now.
[02:35:27.932 --> 02:35:28.673]  You really ought to do it.
[02:35:30.456 --> 02:35:32.378]  The results are dramatic after six days.
[02:35:32.799 --> 02:35:34.622]  And I'm like, no way, no way I'm doing it.
[02:35:35.162 --> 02:35:38.327]  I don't believe that there's giant black or green balls in my gallbladder.
[02:35:38.467 --> 02:35:39.328]  This is how ignorant I am.
[02:35:40.580 --> 02:35:55.376]  How does the apple cider vinegar organic with the oxy powder and with the liver trucks over a six-day cleanse, how does it then when you take the olive oil at the end, lay on your side for an hour as you go to sleep, why does it then have the gallbladder release?
[02:35:55.877 --> 02:36:00.782]  What you should do, and this is what our proprietary research led us to do back
[02:36:01.503 --> 02:36:15.808]  Starting in the early 90s, when we were looking at the best ways to cleanse the liver, was to develop an herbal formula that contains herbs that will help soften or break down these globules or these stones in the liver and the gallbladder.
[02:36:16.148 --> 02:36:18.649]  And that's really what the first five days is for.
[02:36:19.130 --> 02:36:27.713]  That's where you mix the bottle of liver shield, you pour the whole bottle in a gallon of distilled water, and then you drink four 8-ounce glasses a day of that,
[02:36:28.573 --> 02:36:29.594]  Four or five days.
[02:36:29.734 --> 02:36:33.196]  At the same time though, you're also using the apple cider vinegar.
[02:36:33.216 --> 02:36:43.984]  And that's going to be the liver flush kit that we put together exclusively for InfoWars viewers and the people that want to support the InfoWar.
[02:36:45.365 --> 02:36:49.667]  So basically that, once you do that for five days, and of course you want to eat fairly healthy.
[02:36:49.687 --> 02:36:52.489]  You don't want to be putting a bunch of chemicals and toxins into your body.
[02:36:52.909 --> 02:36:57.191]  But then on day five is when you actually do the olive oil.
[02:36:57.251 --> 02:37:04.935]  And when you do Epsom salts, and the Epsom salts that you drink will actually help relax the bile duct.
[02:37:05.875 --> 02:37:13.720]  And make it a lot more elastic so any of the stones can pass through there or the globules, the toxic globules.
[02:37:14.340 --> 02:37:20.404]  And then when you lay on your, you drink the olive oil, you lay on your right side, because your liver is on the right side.
[02:37:21.164 --> 02:37:30.807]  And that heavy oil ends up absorbing down through your intestinal lining and going into the liver, and it kind of works like oil pulling, which is a big thing now.
[02:37:30.827 --> 02:37:39.470]  It was on Dr. Ross with the coconut oil, where you swish it in your mouth, and oil has an affinity for toxic substances and absorbs some of those.
[02:37:40.090 --> 02:37:46.112]  And when you do the liver cleanse, you will actually form, also, little oil globulins as well.
[02:37:46.832 --> 02:37:56.783]  So the reason why you take during the flush, the liver flush, the reason why you take oxy powder at the same time is because you want to be able to flush that out of the system.
[02:37:56.803 --> 02:38:07.255]  Because when the liver dumps all those toxic balls and rocks and all that toxic buildup that's been in there for years and years and years, you want to have something to flush it out of the intestines.
[02:38:08.743 --> 02:38:12.206]  Again, Liver Shield is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[02:38:12.246 --> 02:38:14.247]  We keep selling out of it for a good reason.
[02:38:14.587 --> 02:38:18.130]  Let me read you one of the reviews that we have at Infowarslife.com.
[02:38:18.450 --> 02:38:20.632]  This is Delilah of Port Richey, Florida.
[02:38:20.652 --> 02:38:22.073]  She says, I did the liver cleanse.
[02:38:22.533 --> 02:38:23.393]  Felt great after it.
[02:38:23.574 --> 02:38:26.496]  I wanted to do a second one, but my hubby has to do it also.
[02:38:26.556 --> 02:38:27.897]  I have to order more for myself.
[02:38:27.977 --> 02:38:29.438]  All products I've tried are awesome.
[02:38:29.878 --> 02:38:30.759]  Brain Force is great.
[02:38:30.839 --> 02:38:33.321]  Super Female Vitality is also superb.
[02:38:33.341 --> 02:38:36.184]  You can read those reviews at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:38:36.224 --> 02:38:38.025]  You can also get Liver Shield.
[02:38:38.066 --> 02:38:39.267]  It's now back in stock.
[02:38:39.587 --> 02:38:48.075]  It's a powerful blend of organic, wild-crafted herbs, as you just heard, specially formulated to support natural function and detoxification of the liver and gallbladder.
[02:38:48.695 --> 02:38:55.516]  As I mentioned earlier, Leanne McAdoo is in the process of doing a liver cleanse, and she's putting up videos on our YouTube channel.
[02:38:55.536 --> 02:38:59.077]  You'll see that there, as well as some of the recipes that she's trying.
[02:38:59.117 --> 02:39:01.858]  So you can follow along with her experience there as well.
[02:39:02.158 --> 02:39:05.579]  Again, Liver Shield is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:39:06.919 --> 02:39:16.861]  Now, as we were talking about in the last segment, of course, Bernie Sandinista being in love with the socialism that he saw down in Nicaragua.
[02:39:17.935 --> 02:39:22.436]  Loving it, I think, largely because he said, you know, these guys are not hacks.
[02:39:22.476 --> 02:39:23.137]  They look like me.
[02:39:23.177 --> 02:39:23.977]  I mean, they're poets.
[02:39:25.837 --> 02:39:29.018]  They do poetry and they're kind of like hippies.
[02:39:29.218 --> 02:39:30.659]  So, you know, these are good guys.
[02:39:30.939 --> 02:39:31.899]  These are authentic guys.
[02:39:32.539 --> 02:39:37.941]  And making the mistake, I think, of hardcore falling for this left-right paradigm.
[02:39:38.601 --> 02:39:52.108]  But just because our foreign policy in Nicaragua was abhorrent, and I agree with Bernie Sanders on that, we talked about that, the Iran-Contra situation, the crack cocaine war that was coming and exposed by Gary Webb and Dark Alliance.
[02:39:52.148 --> 02:39:56.211]  Yes, that was very evil, but that doesn't make the Sandinistas good guys.
[02:39:57.071 --> 02:39:57.952]  They were horrible guys.
[02:39:57.972 --> 02:39:59.733]  There weren't two good groups.
[02:39:59.773 --> 02:40:03.096]  The Contras were bad, and so were the Sandinistas.
[02:40:03.776 --> 02:40:07.179]  Yet 30 years later, Bernie Sanders hasn't learned anything.
[02:40:07.199 --> 02:40:09.901]  He's still pushing this left-right paradigm.
[02:40:09.941 --> 02:40:14.825]  Many of his followers are still following in that left-right paradigm, just because they don't like
[02:40:16.089 --> 02:40:21.534]  Policies by the Republicans, that means that Bernie and the diametrically opposed socialists must be right.
[02:40:21.595 --> 02:40:22.676]  No, it's not right.
[02:40:23.236 --> 02:40:31.144]  When you're going to go in and say we're going to all become wealthy by increasing the minimum wage for the poorest people.
[02:40:31.905 --> 02:40:34.928]  First of all, we know what happens when you increase minimum wage.
[02:40:34.988 --> 02:40:35.348]  It has
[02:40:39.181 --> 02:40:45.610]  Any more than quantitative easing creates more wealth.
[02:40:46.010 --> 02:40:50.176]  It's essentially quantitative easing for those people who are part of the working class.
[02:40:50.196 --> 02:40:52.339]  But as I also pointed out just before we went to break,
[02:40:53.180 --> 02:40:57.424]  They're policies of mandates and everything boils down to a mandate.
[02:40:57.924 --> 02:41:06.712]  The only thing Democrats are pro-choice on, Democrats like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, the only thing that they're pro-choice on is your choice to kill your children.
[02:41:07.413 --> 02:41:10.255]  How they're going to be schooled, whether or not they're going to get vaccines.
[02:41:11.567 --> 02:41:16.590]  How they're going to get health insurance, all of that is mandated and to be run eventually by the government.
[02:41:16.650 --> 02:41:19.912]  And a good example of it are these penalties that are going up.
[02:41:20.012 --> 02:41:20.892]  It's going to be $695 or 2.5% of your income.
[02:41:24.761 --> 02:41:27.943]  Now understand that works out to be about the same at $28,000.
[02:41:28.483 --> 02:41:30.064]  And guess what?
[02:41:30.564 --> 02:41:34.286]  That is the federal poverty level for a family of five.
[02:41:34.446 --> 02:41:37.708]  This is an article again that I was quoting from by Michael Schneider.
[02:41:38.308 --> 02:41:42.151]  And he points out that 38% of all Americans make less than $20,000 a year.
[02:41:43.031 --> 02:41:44.572]  If you were making minimum wage today,
[02:41:45.390 --> 02:41:47.231]  You would be making less than $20,000 a year.
[02:41:47.251 --> 02:41:52.114]  You'd be making about $14,000-$15,000 if you still had a 40-hour work week.
[02:41:52.874 --> 02:41:58.738]  You might have seen that cut down to 30 hours because of Obamacare mandates.
[02:41:59.018 --> 02:42:00.879]  Your employer may have cut your hours down.
[02:42:00.919 --> 02:42:04.381]  But let's say that you're getting 40 hours and you're making minimum wage.
[02:42:04.781 --> 02:42:05.982]  You're not going to be paying 2.5%.
[02:42:06.342 --> 02:42:09.963]  You're going to be paying that $695.
[02:42:10.283 --> 02:42:14.285]  Anybody that makes more than $28,000, they're going to pay 2.5%.
[02:42:14.865 --> 02:42:21.088]  So if you're making $100,000, you're going to pay $2,500 as an Obamacare penalty if you don't have insurance.
[02:42:21.728 --> 02:42:30.552]  But the people who can least afford to get the insurance who are on the bottom end of this, they're going to be paying a penalty of 5% if they're making minimum wage.
[02:42:31.513 --> 02:42:34.335]  How's that working out for you, that socialist compassion?
[02:42:34.775 --> 02:42:37.137]  That's where we see this going all the time.
[02:42:38.778 --> 02:42:49.967]  I just want to reiterate again the theme that we see happening over and over again in the news, and that is just ignoring the law and what that does to our system.
[02:42:50.967 --> 02:42:52.529]  Many people can't really understand
[02:42:53.516 --> 02:42:55.837]  What is at stake in the Benghazi hearings?
[02:42:56.298 --> 02:43:01.841]  They can't understand what's going on with Hillary Clinton's emails, because they're too invested in her personally.
[02:43:02.662 --> 02:43:11.807]  Just like Bernie Sanders couldn't really see past the fact that these guys were poetry-spouting hippies, but they were also authoritarian murderers, okay?
[02:43:12.267 --> 02:43:15.569]  Who were stealing people's property, who were keeping it for themselves.
[02:43:16.050 --> 02:43:17.611]  But he couldn't see past the facade.
[02:43:17.651 --> 02:43:19.172]  He still can't, 30 years later.
[02:43:19.992 --> 02:43:26.558]  People can't understand what's going on with Hillary Clinton's emails because they're too invested in partisan politics.
[02:43:26.578 --> 02:43:28.079]  They're too invested in the person.
[02:43:28.879 --> 02:43:36.906]  So, to help you understand this, let's think of this, so that you can see this objectively, let's think of this in the abstract.
[02:43:36.926 --> 02:43:39.268]  Let's make up an imaginary country.
[02:43:39.949 --> 02:43:44.652]  Let's pretend there's some country called Canada that you've never heard of, okay?
[02:43:46.114 --> 02:43:48.476]  What would happen if they deleted emails
[02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:51.741]  The government officials there deleted emails.
[02:43:51.761 --> 02:43:53.062]  What would happen in Canada?
[02:43:53.142 --> 02:43:54.263]  Well, let's take a look at this.
[02:43:55.063 --> 02:43:58.205]  What if there was a place called British Columbia?
[02:43:58.285 --> 02:44:07.031]  And what if the Premier there, maybe named Christy Clark, routinely thwarted information requests, freedom of information requests?
[02:44:07.731 --> 02:44:12.294]  Sometimes triple-deleting emails, you know, to make sure that they're completely gone.
[02:44:13.345 --> 02:44:20.634]  Well, they just might call for more changes to an embedded culture that discourages written documentation and record keeping.
[02:44:20.674 --> 02:44:23.057]  This is from the Globe and Mail in Canada.
[02:44:23.077 --> 02:44:24.558]  You know, that place you've never heard of.
[02:44:25.302 --> 02:44:36.932]  The provincial government, they said, either, quote, willfully or negligently fails to produce documents and evades personal accountability by relying on only verbal responses to information requests.
[02:44:36.952 --> 02:44:38.093]  They won't put anything in writing.
[02:44:38.594 --> 02:44:41.316]  In one case, a senior aide lied under oath.
[02:44:41.396 --> 02:44:43.057]  Even though they're doing it verbally, they lie.
[02:44:43.358 --> 02:44:44.859]  Even though they're under oath, they lie.
[02:44:45.940 --> 02:44:52.526]  They lied to commission investigators about his role in deleting emails that were the subject of an information request.
[02:44:53.686 --> 02:44:58.288]  In response, the government on Thursday accepted the resignation of that aide at the center of the investigation.
[02:44:58.328 --> 02:44:58.908]  Imagine that.
[02:44:59.208 --> 02:45:05.111]  If somebody lied under oath, if somebody obstructed justice, they would at least be fired.
[02:45:05.811 --> 02:45:07.792]  They ought to be going to jail, but they would at least be fired.
[02:45:07.812 --> 02:45:09.613]  Can you imagine an imaginary country like that?
[02:45:09.693 --> 02:45:11.474]  Certainly wouldn't be America.
[02:45:12.777 --> 02:45:22.105]  Some other countries, like Iceland, they jail the bankers when they steal from the people, and in Canada they kind of get upset if you delete emails and do cover-ups.
[02:45:22.566 --> 02:45:30.973]  They point out in specific cases they failed to tell the truth under oath, and they have now been referred to the RCMP, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
[02:45:30.993 --> 02:45:37.058]  In other words, it's a crime to commit perjury, to obstruct justice,
[02:45:37.819 --> 02:45:39.281]  Do you remember Richard Nixon?
[02:45:39.301 --> 02:45:44.766]  Remember Hillary Clinton was part of the team that was investigating Richard Nixon.
[02:45:44.806 --> 02:45:48.610]  Now she's become Richard Nixon, just like Barack Obama has.
[02:45:49.431 --> 02:45:49.811]  They say...
[02:45:50.914 --> 02:45:52.135]  That Ms.
[02:45:52.155 --> 02:46:00.722]  Denham, who is investigating this, has done a very good job exposing the culture of deception, which is delete, delete, delete.
[02:46:01.382 --> 02:46:02.964]  That's what the investigators said here.
[02:46:03.504 --> 02:46:15.494]  They said that their conduct was reprehensible, and understand, too, that what Hillary Clinton is saying, when she says, oh, these aren't classified documents, well, we've talked about that, that in and of itself is a lie.
[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:19.103]  Many of these documents are born classified.
[02:46:19.644 --> 02:46:26.611]  That's what the fellow who set up the rules, he's retired now, but he was setting up the rules for how the government handles classified information.
[02:46:26.631 --> 02:46:34.739]  He says when you have confidential communications between heads of state, between the Secretary of State and other heads of state, that is born classified.
[02:46:34.779 --> 02:46:36.681]  You don't have to wait for it to get a stamp.
[02:46:37.402 --> 02:46:38.403]  So, she knows that.
[02:46:39.264 --> 02:46:44.885]  She knows that there are some things on her server that are classified.
[02:46:45.205 --> 02:46:58.108]  But nevertheless, understand that NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake, and I've interviewed him, pointed out that he'd been prosecuted for, and persecuted really, for having unclassified as well as classified documents.
[02:46:58.148 --> 02:47:01.969]  The classified documents he had were documents that should not have been classified.
[02:47:02.429 --> 02:47:03.109]  There were things like
[02:47:03.829 --> 02:47:04.790]  Know your enemy.
[02:47:05.431 --> 02:47:06.932]  Make sure you back up your work.
[02:47:07.413 --> 02:47:13.278]  These types of duck-and-cover instructional documents, they should not have been classified.
[02:47:13.298 --> 02:47:20.666]  But he was prosecuted, persecuted, for having unclassified documents on his computer as well.
[02:47:20.706 --> 02:47:24.209]  Of course, they dropped those charges the day he was to go to trial.
[02:47:24.289 --> 02:47:26.771]  It was simply an outright persecution.
[02:47:27.432 --> 02:47:31.755]  Nevertheless, that is precisely what Hillary Clinton is saying.
[02:47:31.875 --> 02:47:33.115]  There's nothing at all to see here.
[02:47:33.456 --> 02:47:33.936]  Move along.
[02:47:34.436 --> 02:47:35.417]  We don't have anything at all.
[02:47:35.457 --> 02:47:41.100]  As a matter of fact, they're complaining about the fact that so much money has been spent on this investigation.
[02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:44.322]  They say Benghazi investigation just keeps going on and on and on.
[02:47:44.382 --> 02:47:46.723]  It's going on longer than the JFK investigation.
[02:47:46.783 --> 02:47:51.546]  And it's like, well, yeah, you know, we never got any answers on the JFK investigation either, unfortunately.
[02:47:51.826 --> 02:47:52.887]  Maybe it should have gone longer.
[02:47:53.646 --> 02:48:00.170]  But here's this article, points out that the feds have spent more on origami condoms and fat lesbian studies than on the Benghazi committee.
[02:48:00.190 --> 02:48:08.015]  And you know, when I looked at this, I thought they'd left a comma off in between origami and condoms, but there must be something called...
[02:48:08.915 --> 02:48:10.296]  Origami condoms, I don't know.
[02:48:10.716 --> 02:48:12.657]  I'll leave that to Howard Stern to explore that.
[02:48:13.657 --> 02:48:29.123]  But, when it comes to fat lesbians, I can understand why they would want to study fat lesbians, because we've got most of the people in the federal government, most of the departments under Obama are being run by fat lesbians, but maybe they could save some money and just ask Hillary Clinton and Janet Napolitano why they're fat.
[02:48:30.164 --> 02:48:37.647]  Nevertheless, Harry Reid is demanding that the Republican National Committee reimburse the government for the cost of the investigation.
[02:48:38.934 --> 02:48:46.039]  We shouldn't be concerned about things like having classified documents on your server.
[02:48:47.140 --> 02:48:51.863]  We just had CIA Director Brennan have his emails hacked.
[02:48:51.983 --> 02:48:53.745]  I guess we shouldn't be concerned about that either.
[02:48:53.845 --> 02:48:54.966]  Does that really matter?
[02:48:55.851 --> 02:48:58.473]  Why should we be concerned about Brennan's emails?
[02:48:59.114 --> 02:48:59.854]  It's no big deal.
[02:49:00.395 --> 02:49:03.417]  Do you think maybe that the CIA director is a target?
[02:49:03.578 --> 02:49:07.161]  Do you think maybe the Secretary of State is a high-value target for state actors?
[02:49:07.421 --> 02:49:10.063]  He got his emails hacked by a teenager.
[02:49:10.784 --> 02:49:14.127]  A teenager broke in and got the CIA director's emails.
[02:49:14.747 --> 02:49:25.904]  He stole his password three times before he shut down his, uh, this teenager stole the CIA director's password three times before the CIA director, in frustration, shut down his account.
[02:49:27.284 --> 02:49:29.405]  See, that's why this is important.
[02:49:29.906 --> 02:49:44.854]  It's important when we have a Secretary of State who flaunts the law, who keeps this stuff secret for the same reason that the people in Canada were keeping this stuff secret, because they were deleting any information that people were requesting.
[02:49:44.894 --> 02:49:48.917]  They didn't have things that they wanted to hide, but they also created security risks.
[02:49:49.497 --> 02:49:53.181]  As we pointed out before, we have this national religion of national security.
[02:49:53.381 --> 02:49:58.226]  Everything must be sacrificed for national security except Hillary Clinton's career.
[02:49:59.047 --> 02:49:59.627]  That's where we are.
[02:49:59.988 --> 02:50:02.650]  Now there's some real questions that have been raised about Benghazi.
[02:50:03.071 --> 02:50:04.492]  Questions that we need to get answers to.
[02:50:04.532 --> 02:50:06.694]  For instance, let's take a look at this flashback.
[02:50:07.595 --> 02:50:12.720]  Broadwell said the Benghazi attacks were aimed at illegal CIA prison and of course
[02:50:13.706 --> 02:50:19.989]  This was the mistress of David Petraeus, who eventually became a CIA director.
[02:50:20.029 --> 02:50:21.150]  This is Paula Broadwell.
[02:50:21.230 --> 02:50:23.451]  She was also a lieutenant colonel.
[02:50:23.551 --> 02:50:26.552]  She served under General Petraeus, as they say.
[02:50:27.192 --> 02:50:36.317]  And she said on October 26th, after the attacks on September 11th, she told an alumni symposium at the University of Denver that the CIA was running a prison at the consulate.
[02:50:37.338 --> 02:50:48.289]  She says, I don't know if a lot of you have heard this, but the CIA annex had actually taken a couple of Libyan militia members prisoner and they think the attack on the consulate was an effort to try to get these prisoners back.
[02:50:49.029 --> 02:50:49.990]  So that's one part of it.
[02:50:50.791 --> 02:50:54.034]  The other part of it is the arms trade that was going on.
[02:50:54.074 --> 02:50:59.439]  We had multiple people talk about the arms deals that were being run out of there, but of course Hillary Clinton
[02:51:00.200 --> 02:51:04.682]  Throws Stevens, Ambassador Stevens, under the bus even as he's dead.
[02:51:04.722 --> 02:51:09.884]  Even as they drug him through the streets, she drags his reputation through the streets saying he's responsible.
[02:51:09.984 --> 02:51:12.385]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.
[02:51:12.605 --> 02:51:13.525]  Get back to nature.

[02:54:17.745 --> 02:54:19.047]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:19.107 --> 02:54:23.232]  We were just talking about how Hillary is escaping justice.
[02:54:23.312 --> 02:54:28.218]  Of course, we don't want to look too closely as to what might have been happening in Benghazi.
[02:54:28.758 --> 02:54:33.924]  The arms trade, there's been multiple investigations talking about that outside of the House committee.
[02:54:34.724 --> 02:54:35.485]  We shouldn't look at that.
[02:54:35.545 --> 02:54:37.768]  We shouldn't look at the hidden emails.
[02:54:37.908 --> 02:54:44.356]  And she throws now the ambassador, Christopher Stevens, under the bus post posthumously.
[02:54:44.376 --> 02:54:49.202]  She says, we're really counting on Chris to guide us and to give us information on the ground.
[02:54:49.262 --> 02:54:51.665]  In other words, he failed, not me.
[02:54:53.032 --> 02:55:02.258]  And now, as more evidence of the fact that we don't ever seem to be able to prosecute wrongdoing with officials here in this country, this just came out.
[02:55:02.898 --> 02:55:10.723]  CNN reports, former IRS official Lois Lerner will not face charges for targeting political groups.
[02:55:11.383 --> 02:55:11.883]  There you go.
[02:55:12.624 --> 02:55:13.925]  Exactly what we were talking about.
[02:55:14.858 --> 02:55:20.821]  We began the show by talking about the fact that Iceland is jailing 26 CEOs, mostly, of banks.
[02:55:20.881 --> 02:55:25.863]  Not lower-level officials, not scapegoats at the bottom, but CEOs who try to defraud the people.
[02:55:27.062 --> 02:55:31.464]  But of course, in America, they're not only too big to fail, they're too big to jail.
[02:55:32.024 --> 02:55:40.368]  But even an IRS official who does the kind of things that Nixon was impeached for, remember he was using the IRS against his political enemies?
[02:55:40.808 --> 02:55:46.831]  Lois Lerner is not going to face charges for targeting people for their political affiliation.
[02:55:47.451 --> 02:55:48.572]  That's the kind of
[02:55:49.392 --> 02:55:50.233]  country that we live in.
[02:55:50.273 --> 02:56:02.044]  Of course, when asked about whether or not, asked about her criminal, the FBI's criminal investigation into her, this is the way Hillary Clinton responded on the Benghazi inquiries yesterday.
[02:56:02.064 --> 02:56:07.450]  Bernie Sanders said that, quote, the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.
[02:56:08.382 --> 02:56:11.786]  But there are a lot of people who are not.
[02:56:11.986 --> 02:56:17.793]  Including FBI officials looking into whether national security was compromised because of this server.
[02:56:18.274 --> 02:56:21.918]  And this is something else that is very... Yeah, just laugh about that.
[02:56:22.218 --> 02:56:23.480]  Sounds just like this pin, doesn't it?
[02:56:25.916 --> 02:56:26.136]  Yeah.
[02:56:27.097 --> 02:56:28.539]  That's the way you get rid of all the problems.
[02:56:28.559 --> 02:56:32.162]  You just laugh them off as if there was any controlling legal authority here.
[02:56:32.202 --> 02:56:33.964]  Remember when Al Gore said that?
[02:56:34.645 --> 02:56:35.866]  Everybody was amazed.
[02:56:35.906 --> 02:56:38.148]  Yeah, there's no legal, controlling legal authority here.
[02:56:38.188 --> 02:56:42.052]  Well, certainly there isn't any controlling legal authority anymore in America.
[02:56:42.392 --> 02:56:44.053]  And look at how Hillary is using this.
[02:56:44.153 --> 02:56:45.234]  She's the victim.
[02:56:45.694 --> 02:56:48.196]  She just laughs off any criminal investigations.
[02:56:48.236 --> 02:56:52.979]  And of course, Obama pours cold water on any criminal investigations in advance.
[02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:56.241]  Essentially saying, well, I'm sure that there wasn't anything to that.
[02:56:56.722 --> 02:56:57.942]  They're still investigating it.
[02:56:57.982 --> 02:57:05.688]  That's unprecedented for a president to come in and say, I'm sure they're not going to find anything as they're still conducting the investigation.
[02:57:05.708 --> 02:57:08.670]  Of course, he was called on that by some former FBI officials.
[02:57:08.730 --> 02:57:11.832]  But Hillary is using the Benghazi hearings to
[02:57:12.993 --> 02:57:14.814]  Do fundraising on her Twitter account.
[02:57:15.034 --> 02:57:15.755]  Look at this!
[02:57:17.076 --> 02:57:19.719]  The Clinton Foundation is a slush fund.
[02:57:20.459 --> 02:57:22.101]  Absolutely a slush fund.
[02:57:22.141 --> 02:57:23.842]  This is from Isabel Vincent.
[02:57:24.202 --> 02:57:33.571]  She says, the Clinton Foundation's finances are so messy that the nation's most influential charity watchdog put it on its watch list of problematic nonprofits last month.
[02:57:34.722 --> 02:57:42.890]  Clinton's mega charity took in more than $140 million in grants and pledges and they only gave out $9 million.
[02:57:43.111 --> 02:57:44.832]  Let's do the math on that.
[02:57:45.393 --> 02:57:48.136]  You take in $140 million and you give out $9 million.
[02:57:48.176 --> 02:57:49.017]  Are you really a charity?
[02:57:49.377 --> 02:57:56.564]  They say a good charity is going to give 75% of its money to the people that they're supposed to help.
[02:57:57.486 --> 02:57:59.851]  Now, what does the Clinton Foundation do?
[02:57:59.992 --> 02:58:01.154]  They don't give 75%.
[02:58:01.976 --> 02:58:03.339]  They have a lot more overhead than 25%.
[02:58:03.399 --> 02:58:03.980]  They give out 6.5%.
[02:58:07.742 --> 02:58:19.213]  They have 94.5% of the money goes to administration, to travel, to salaries, to bonuses, with the fattest payouts going to family friends, they say.
[02:58:19.314 --> 02:58:27.962]  So Charity Navigator, which rates non-profits, refused to rate the Clinton Foundation because its atypical business model does not meet our criteria.
[02:58:28.202 --> 02:58:30.645]  Then the Washington Post reports after that,
[02:58:30.965 --> 02:58:33.888]  There's another $26 million that they didn't even report.
[02:58:33.928 --> 02:58:40.013]  So now, if you redo the math, that means that they are only giving out 5.5%.
[02:58:41.874 --> 02:58:44.637]  Not 75%, like a legitimate charity would.
[02:58:44.677 --> 02:58:45.117]  Stay with us.
[02:58:45.397 --> 02:58:46.939]  We'll be right back with a fourth hour.
[02:58:50.422 --> 02:58:52.223]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:53.905 --> 02:58:55.967]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:59.747 --> 02:59:00.307]  I want more candy!
[02:59:00.327 --> 02:59:01.427]  I want more video games!
[02:59:01.468 --> 02:59:01.608]  Mine!
[02:59:01.668 --> 02:59:01.828]  Mine!
[02:59:02.148 --> 02:59:02.708]  Mine!
[02:59:02.988 --> 02:59:12.371]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:59:12.711 --> 02:59:15.291]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:59:15.411 --> 02:59:18.772]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:59:18.972 --> 02:59:24.994]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[02:59:25.294 --> 02:59:27.815]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[02:59:28.015 --> 02:59:28.195]  I'm good.
[02:59:47.952 --> 02:59:49.553]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:22.188 --> 03:00:23.109]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:23.710 --> 03:00:25.612]  We are now entering overdrive.
[03:00:26.092 --> 03:00:30.717]  With your host, Alex Jones broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:31.278 --> 03:00:34.942]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:38.188 --> 03:00:39.649]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:39.709 --> 03:00:43.270]  I'm David Knight and this is our fourth hour of the news wrap-up.
[03:00:43.310 --> 03:00:47.993]  We're also going to have at the bottom of the hour Abby Johnson, a Planned Parenthood whistleblower.
[03:00:48.033 --> 03:00:52.495]  She used to be a manager here in Texas of a Planned Parenthood facility.
[03:00:52.595 --> 03:00:54.856]  She knows them from the inside out.
[03:00:54.916 --> 03:00:56.477]  And as we pointed out earlier in the show,
[03:00:57.984 --> 03:01:05.129]  The Planned Parenthood crowd is very upset that some raw videos have leaked out of a House Investigation Committee.
[03:01:05.149 --> 03:01:13.215]  This is the committee chaired by Jason Chaffetz, who was also one of those in the running for the House Speakership to replace John Boehner.
[03:01:14.036 --> 03:01:19.119]  They were looking at these Planned Parenthood videos that were done by the Center for Medical Progress.
[03:01:19.139 --> 03:01:24.784]  And, of course, Planned Parenthood said, well, these things have been dishonestly and deceptively edited.
[03:01:25.545 --> 03:01:27.397]  So the committee said give us the raw footage.
[03:01:27.417 --> 03:01:28.162]  We'll take a look at that.
[03:01:29.016 --> 03:01:38.642]  So the abortionists replied, and of course this is the National Abortion Federation, they got a temporary restraining order, said, no, no, no, you better not let that stuff get out.
[03:01:38.783 --> 03:01:39.923]  Nevertheless, it did leak.
[03:01:40.444 --> 03:01:45.867]  Somebody, a House staffer, apparently leaked this to a conservative website, Got News.
[03:01:46.288 --> 03:01:54.293]  The editor ignored the injunction and said, I will contest any unconstitutional prior restraint of speech.
[03:01:54.413 --> 03:01:58.196]  So they have, he has now put out the unedited raw footage.
[03:01:58.236 --> 03:01:58.536]  And so
[03:01:59.356 --> 03:02:05.262]  The question is why would they object to that if there's not anything that is incriminating?
[03:02:05.803 --> 03:02:11.248]  I want to take a look in this hour before we get to Abby Johnson's interview at the bottom of the hour.
[03:02:11.308 --> 03:02:13.930]  I want to take a look also at this issue of the $750 pill.
[03:02:16.607 --> 03:02:17.548]  Is it corporate greed?
[03:02:17.608 --> 03:02:18.849]  Is it excessive regulation?
[03:02:18.909 --> 03:02:19.669]  Or is it both?
[03:02:19.689 --> 03:02:24.953]  This is an article by Mary Ruart, someone that I knew from the Libertarian Party.
[03:02:24.993 --> 03:02:28.415]  She ran for office multiple times in the Libertarian Party.
[03:02:28.435 --> 03:02:30.437]  She's somebody who worked in the pharmaceutical industry.
[03:02:30.717 --> 03:02:32.198]  I think she has an interesting take on that.
[03:02:32.238 --> 03:02:35.540]  And there's been an update on this story as well.
[03:02:35.580 --> 03:02:39.563]  So we're going to talk about what has come up with that in the next segment.
[03:02:40.063 --> 03:02:45.048]  But first I want to go back to this story that just broke on CNN about a former IRS official, Lois Lerner.
[03:02:45.588 --> 03:02:47.690]  They say she will not be charged.
[03:02:47.770 --> 03:02:49.031]  This is what CNN is reporting.
[03:02:49.051 --> 03:02:58.099]  There will be no charges against former IRS official Lois Lerner or anyone else at the agency, said the Justice Department in a letter.
[03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:00.862]  Yeah, Obama's Justice Department.
[03:03:01.422 --> 03:03:02.023]  The same people
[03:03:03.038 --> 03:03:10.465]  That would not take any action against banks that were laundering money for drug dealers and terrorists.
[03:03:10.946 --> 03:03:12.647]  Multiple times caught doing that.
[03:03:13.188 --> 03:03:18.172]  They would not take any action against the banks who are rigging the LIBOR rate.
[03:03:18.573 --> 03:03:23.818]  Okay, that's the London Interbank Exchange Rate that is used to set up
[03:03:24.398 --> 03:03:29.025]  All as an index to set up interest rates and to adjust your variable rate interest.
[03:03:29.105 --> 03:03:35.755]  I mean, if you've got something like a credit card, if you've got a home loan that is set up as a variable rate loan, it's based on the LIBOR.
[03:03:36.863 --> 03:04:06.363]  Rates and they're not they were manipulating that to make money in London criminally Manipulating that but of course nobody's gonna go to jail for that Nobody's gonna go to jail for targeting people at the IRS either they say they found substantial evidence of mismanagement of poor judgment of institutional inertia Leading to the belief by many tax-exempt applicants that the IRS targeted them based on their political viewpoints but poor management is not a crime says the
[03:04:07.243 --> 03:04:08.064]  Justice Department.
[03:04:08.644 --> 03:04:13.947]  Well, evidently, if you know the right people, nothing is a crime in America anymore.
[03:04:14.867 --> 03:04:15.948]  That's really what we're seeing here.
[03:04:16.368 --> 03:04:20.130]  This is nothing but criminals getting away with it.
[03:04:20.611 --> 03:04:24.853]  We just heard Hillary Clinton laughing about the FBI investigating her.
[03:04:24.913 --> 03:04:31.677]  And understand that the government, as I mentioned before, they prosecuted an NSA whistleblower, Thomas Drake.
[03:04:33.151 --> 03:04:37.955]  And they said that he had classified documents on his private server.
[03:04:38.015 --> 03:04:41.438]  They said he had unclassified documents on his private server.
[03:04:41.498 --> 03:04:42.819]  They came after him.
[03:04:43.380 --> 03:04:45.341]  It was a baloney prosecution.
[03:04:45.702 --> 03:04:49.485]  But nevertheless, that would have been a crime if he had really done that.
[03:04:50.206 --> 03:04:51.947]  And people have been prosecuted for that.
[03:04:52.307 --> 03:04:54.689]  But it depends on what level you are in the government.
[03:04:54.769 --> 03:04:56.331]  Because that's the kind of corrupt government we have.
[03:04:56.371 --> 03:04:56.751]  Stay with us.
[03:04:56.991 --> 03:04:58.513]  We'll be right back to talk about this $750 pill.
[03:05:09.748 --> 03:05:16.292]  After the release of numerous videos showing questionable Planned Parenthood practices, multiple facilities have been raided.
[03:05:16.652 --> 03:05:28.120]  Reuters reports, Texas officials raided several Planned Parenthood facilities on Thursday, in a move that comes days after the state's Republican leaders barred the women's health group from receiving state Medicaid money.
[03:05:28.360 --> 03:05:33.523]  The Inspector General's office declined to comment, but its agents were seen on local news reports
[03:05:33.763 --> 03:05:50.649]  Entering a Planned Parenthood facility in San Antonio, Texas said it would launch a probe of Planned Parenthood after the release of videos in July by anti-abortion activist group Center for Medical Progress, in which a Planned Parenthood official is seen talking about transactions involving fetal tissue.
[03:05:51.069 --> 03:05:55.691]  And speaking on a personal note, Planned Parenthood continues to say that the videos were edited
[03:05:55.911 --> 03:06:00.839]  Which they were, much like you would edit a State of the Union address down to a few soundbites.
[03:06:00.939 --> 03:06:03.604]  But that doesn't mean that they were taken out of context.
[03:06:03.884 --> 03:06:07.650]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com

[03:08:12.583 --> 03:08:18.614]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:19.236 --> 03:08:22.201]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:27.026 --> 03:08:28.407]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:28.427 --> 03:08:28.987]  I'm David Knight.
[03:08:29.087 --> 03:08:30.948]  This is our fourth hour of the news wrap-up.
[03:08:30.968 --> 03:08:35.891]  At the bottom of the hour we're going to be talking to Planned Parenthood whistleblower Abby Johnson.
[03:08:36.571 --> 03:08:39.133]  She was a former manager at a Planned Parenthood facility.
[03:08:39.153 --> 03:08:50.559]  We're going to talk to her about the latest revelations and of course the fact that Planned Parenthood is very upset now that the raw videos have been leaked from a House committee investigating the
[03:08:52.575 --> 03:08:56.018]  The videos that were put out by the Center for Medical Progress.
[03:08:56.058 --> 03:08:56.658]  I had to look it up.
[03:08:56.758 --> 03:09:03.304]  It's such a generic name, and it was brilliant for them to use that name because it makes them look like a medical organization.
[03:09:03.584 --> 03:09:07.087]  But such a generic name, I always have to look it up whenever I mention it.
[03:09:07.107 --> 03:09:09.669]  But the Center for Medical Progress did the undercover videos.
[03:09:09.689 --> 03:09:10.950]  They said, oh, they're heavily edited.
[03:09:11.590 --> 03:09:14.652]  And then the raw videos, they were concerned, would get out.
[03:09:14.713 --> 03:09:17.715]  So they got a court injunction, but they have leaked out nevertheless.
[03:09:19.236 --> 03:09:20.857]  Going back to the Clinton
[03:09:21.952 --> 03:09:24.034]  Benghazi Committee hearing, of course.
[03:09:24.515 --> 03:09:37.148]  Many people, this has unfolded over such a long period of time, that just like the IRS investigations of Lois Lerner, what the IRS was doing targeting political groups, that's now been thrown out by the Justice Department.
[03:09:37.168 --> 03:09:40.832]  They say she's not going to be charged and nobody else at the IRS is going to be charged either.
[03:09:42.346 --> 03:09:51.500]  They let these investigations drag out for a very, very long time and people start to forget the startling elements of these things when they first broke.
[03:09:52.342 --> 03:09:54.966]  Just like we forget the timeline of Benghazi.
[03:09:55.547 --> 03:09:57.369]  We forget that Hillary Clinton
[03:09:58.678 --> 03:10:05.082]  And the State Department came up with multiple explanations for what had happened there.
[03:10:05.142 --> 03:10:08.864]  We got a different explanation every day for several days.
[03:10:08.924 --> 03:10:14.508]  They charged a filmmaker and put him in jail saying that he had incited the riot.
[03:10:15.450 --> 03:10:16.630]  Absolute nonsense.
[03:10:16.690 --> 03:10:17.951]  But that's the level they will go to.
[03:10:18.411 --> 03:10:25.552]  She will lie to the face of the people whose family died there in order to cover up what really happened there.
[03:10:26.473 --> 03:10:39.356]  She will throw the former ambassador who died and was drugged through the streets, she will throw him under the bus now saying, well we were relying on him to help us with information, to help us with information about security.
[03:10:39.376 --> 03:10:39.416]  No.
[03:10:40.436 --> 03:10:58.717]  No, they knew what was going on there and it was also part of an arms trade that was going on there, but of course now there's no question that Libya has become a terrorist arms bazaar thanks to our failed foreign policy of Obama and the Secretary of State.
[03:10:59.357 --> 03:11:01.219]  But she just laughs this off.
[03:11:02.068 --> 03:11:10.830]  One of the things that came out of the hearing yesterday, I thought it was interesting what Drudge noticed, and he had this up at the top of the Drudge Report.
[03:11:12.471 --> 03:11:16.752]  One of the things that he thought was most significant about it was Hillary Clinton's coughing fit.
[03:11:16.872 --> 03:11:19.993]  Let's listen to what happened as they were asking her questions.
[03:11:20.033 --> 03:11:23.894]  He said, maybe this brings up some serious questions about her health.
[03:11:23.974 --> 03:11:26.995]  Maybe that's the most interesting thing to come out of these hearings.
[03:11:27.922 --> 03:11:31.865]  ...in Europe, commanded a missile cruiser, a missile destroyer, a tanker.
[03:11:31.905 --> 03:11:33.726]  He served in Vietnam and the Persian Gulf.
[03:11:37.449 --> 03:11:37.929]  Excuse me.
[03:11:40.511 --> 03:11:41.812]  You need some water, madam?
[03:11:44.954 --> 03:11:48.517]  If anybody in the audience knows Heimlich Maneuver, please remain seated.
[03:11:52.359 --> 03:11:54.321]  Would you like to take...
[03:11:55.236 --> 03:11:56.937]  This goes on for quite some time.
[03:11:56.957 --> 03:12:04.060]  We won't play the rest of it here because people turning on the radio will kind of wonder what's going on with somebody just coughing and silence there.
[03:12:04.100 --> 03:12:08.361]  But of course the questioner, a Democrat, was covering for her on that as well.
[03:12:09.042 --> 03:12:15.364]  He just started monologuing about whatever to fill time so people wouldn't notice that she couldn't talk at all.
[03:12:15.424 --> 03:12:18.706]  So I think that was a pretty interesting development.
[03:12:18.746 --> 03:12:21.007]  Drudge thought it was interesting, said maybe that's the most
[03:12:21.667 --> 03:12:33.950]  Interesting thing to come out of the Benghazi hearings because they are essentially stonewalling there as they have everywhere else with the IRS frauds, with the prosecutions and non-prosecutions of banks everywhere.
[03:12:35.185 --> 03:12:42.549]  Vladimir Putin is saying, says that the US is using terrorists as a battering ram to overthrow disliked regimes.
[03:12:43.210 --> 03:12:44.531]  Of course they are.
[03:12:44.791 --> 03:12:48.233]  We've been saying that for a long time and it's good that he is saying this.
[03:12:48.613 --> 03:12:55.057]  It's good that we have people on the world stage pointing out that we are using terrorists as surrogates.
[03:12:55.077 --> 03:12:56.118]  He certainly knows that.
[03:12:56.798 --> 03:13:01.067]  He saw us using Al-Qaeda against Russia in Afghanistan.
[03:13:01.247 --> 03:13:04.093]  They were called the Mujahideen.
[03:13:04.253 --> 03:13:06.337]  Remember back in Reagan's time?
[03:13:07.711 --> 03:13:08.531]  They created them.
[03:13:08.591 --> 03:13:10.592]  They equipped them against the Russians.
[03:13:10.673 --> 03:13:12.694]  They then eventually became Al-Qaeda.
[03:13:13.294 --> 03:13:15.215]  Osama Bin Laden was one of their guys.
[03:13:15.235 --> 03:13:21.038]  They've also used Islamic terrorists to attack Russia via the Chechnya Islamicists.
[03:13:21.158 --> 03:13:27.681]  And they moved those same Chechens, the same Chechen Islamic Jihadis, they moved to Syria.
[03:13:28.261 --> 03:13:34.705]  We had an interview with one of the leaders go public just about three weeks ago, I think it was, where he was talking about how they had
[03:13:35.405 --> 03:13:36.326]  Relocated them.
[03:13:36.406 --> 03:13:42.712]  The CIA and others had relocated them from using them against Russia into Syria.
[03:13:43.152 --> 03:13:44.413]  So that's precisely what they're doing.
[03:13:44.473 --> 03:13:46.275]  And Putin has another article from Putin.
[03:13:46.295 --> 03:13:48.777]  That one was on Infowars.com.
[03:13:48.797 --> 03:13:49.798]  That's Mikhail Phelan.
[03:13:49.818 --> 03:13:51.720]  You can check out the details on that.
[03:13:51.780 --> 03:13:56.404]  Putin also says there's no need to distinguish between moderate and other terrorists.
[03:13:57.270 --> 03:13:58.711]  Are they really moderate terrorists?
[03:13:59.092 --> 03:13:59.872]  I don't think so.
[03:13:59.972 --> 03:14:12.143]  I think that they're all terrorists, except we have to understand, and this is finally starting to come out, that the United States is using all of these people as surrogates, and has for a very long time.
[03:14:13.564 --> 03:14:16.006]  Let's go to health news at this moment.
[03:14:16.547 --> 03:14:19.469]  We've had a lot of back and forth saying that it was a market failure.
[03:14:19.489 --> 03:14:28.557]  Remember when we had that guy who was a young hedge fund manager, made a lot of money, decided he'd buy a pharmaceutical company, Turing Pharmaceuticals.
[03:14:28.577 --> 03:14:32.620]  The CEO was Martin Shkreli, I think is the way you pronounce his last name.
[03:14:32.660 --> 03:14:35.903]  Nevertheless, he bought this pharmaceutical company that had a very old
[03:14:37.228 --> 03:14:37.648]  I think so.
[03:14:54.625 --> 03:14:57.067]  For people who are struggling with AIDS.
[03:14:57.467 --> 03:15:04.152]  And so, that 5,000% increase in the price of that drug, many people said, how, you know, look at this.
[03:15:04.272 --> 03:15:07.754]  This is what happens when you have unbridled capitalism.
[03:15:08.355 --> 03:15:09.175]  This kind of greed.
[03:15:09.876 --> 03:15:16.861]  Well, Mary Ruart writes a column and she says, a $750 pill, is it corporate greed or is it excessive regulation or is it both?
[03:15:17.662 --> 03:15:21.183]  Now, she is someone who is a, she's a libertarian writer and activist.
[03:15:21.203 --> 03:15:26.704]  She's also been a pharmaceutical researcher, so she knows what happens inside the FDA.
[03:15:27.524 --> 03:15:40.507]  And she points out that Turing Pharmaceuticals has had a de facto monopoly, courtesy of the ever-increasing costs of gaining FDA approval, both for new drugs, over a billion dollars in 11 years, and for generics.
[03:15:40.627 --> 03:15:43.448]  Any generic company could make this drug, Daraprim.
[03:15:44.008 --> 03:15:45.869]  This patent expired decades ago.
[03:15:45.929 --> 03:15:55.494]  However, the FDA would require that the company demonstrate that its pill released the drug into the bloodstream at the same rate as the original Daraprim.
[03:15:56.114 --> 03:16:04.018]  So coupled with the cost of setting up FDA-approved manufacturing facilities for the drug, a turnaround time of a couple of years or so due to regulatory red tape,
[03:16:04.538 --> 03:16:19.621]  And the expensive clinical trials a generic company would need to commit to spending many millions, perhaps tens of millions of dollars, even with the special exemption that the FDA gives drugs that have a small or an orphan patient population.
[03:16:20.424 --> 03:16:26.269]  She says, FDA-mandated drug development, both new and generic, virtually eliminates competition.
[03:16:27.070 --> 03:16:27.890]  And see, that's the question.
[03:16:27.911 --> 03:16:35.917]  When you look at this and you say, this guy was able to raise the price from $1,350 to $750 a pill, a 5,000% increase.
[03:16:36.698 --> 03:16:38.340]  Why was he able to do that?
[03:16:38.540 --> 03:16:41.242]  Where are the other companies that are coming out with drugs?
[03:16:41.302 --> 03:16:47.487]  And she points out, well, you don't have a free market when you have excessive regulation by the FDA.
[03:16:48.393 --> 03:16:53.302]  See, the FDA has enacted a certain kind of drug prohibition, haven't they?
[03:16:54.023 --> 03:16:59.292]  We have the DEA, which says you can't take recreational drugs, hallucinogenics or whatever, they just...
[03:17:00.538 --> 03:17:28.019]  have prohibited it like uh... they did alcohol prohibition except without the constitutional amendment of course because we don't really need the constitution anymore we just say it's uh... make it so but the FDA has gone the other direction the FDA says everything is prohibited for medical use unless expressly permitted so you have to get even special permission if you have a fatal disease in order to use it you can't experiment uh... be part of an experimental program
[03:17:28.479 --> 03:17:31.480]  Even if you're going to die, the FDA does not allow that.
[03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:33.641]  Except under some circumstances.
[03:17:33.681 --> 03:17:39.763]  You can beg them for permission, and perhaps they'll let you be part of a program, but you can't make that determination on your own.
[03:17:40.423 --> 03:17:42.944]  See, that's the other side of drug prohibition.
[03:17:43.624 --> 03:17:53.528]  The idea, and this is pervasive throughout the government, the idea that everything is prohibited unless expressly permitted, that we have no rights, we only have government-granted privileges.
[03:17:54.288 --> 03:17:56.329]  Well, now there's a new twist on this.
[03:17:57.571 --> 03:18:10.531]  This is reported by Occupy Democrats, and they're looking at this and they say, well, the price-gouging pharmaceutical CEO, who has tried to raise this by 5,000%, it looks like now he's going to be undercut.
[03:18:11.598 --> 03:18:22.602]  By another company, a San Diego-based company, announced that it will sell this drug, Daraprim, as low as $99 for a 100-pill supply.
[03:18:22.662 --> 03:18:25.783]  They say, yeah, that's right, it's just over a dollar per pill.
[03:18:26.583 --> 03:18:37.047]  So, not only are they going to cut down this pill that he wanted to sell for $750, but he was selling it for decades at $13.50, and nobody went into competition with him.
[03:18:38.007 --> 03:18:41.035]  Now these people are saying they're going to do it at one dollar a pill.
[03:18:42.077 --> 03:18:44.062]  And I find that very interesting because
[03:18:45.927 --> 03:18:52.832]  It just shows that unless you get this kind of attention, and I still have questions based on what Mary Ruart wrote.
[03:18:52.852 --> 03:18:55.514]  She's very knowledgeable about the pharmaceutical industry.
[03:18:55.974 --> 03:19:08.282]  Based on what she wrote, is this going to be something like the McDonald's announcement that they're going to go to natural whole foods, to no antibiotics in their meat, to grain-fed beef and that sort of thing?
[03:19:08.362 --> 03:19:13.126]  But, oh yeah, if you read the fine print, that's going to be years, maybe decades down the road.
[03:19:13.886 --> 03:19:15.447]  That's not something that's going to happen right away.
[03:19:15.487 --> 03:19:20.329]  This might be a PR campaign by this particular company.
[03:19:20.449 --> 03:19:23.230]  I don't know how long it's going to take them to get approval for this.
[03:19:23.690 --> 03:19:25.791]  They may be able to expedite that.
[03:19:25.891 --> 03:19:27.872]  But that's precisely the issue.
[03:19:28.172 --> 03:19:35.095]  If you have a true free market, somebody can come in and create the pill and sell it for whatever they can manufacture it for.
[03:19:35.495 --> 03:19:38.877]  At $13.50 they were making a huge profit if these people can do it for a dollar.
[03:19:39.637 --> 03:19:41.198]  But you have to have a free market.
[03:19:41.478 --> 03:19:47.002]  When the socialists like Bernie Sanders say that capitalism has failed, I would say we haven't tried it.
[03:19:47.422 --> 03:19:48.843]  We don't have a free market.
[03:19:49.144 --> 03:19:57.649]  We have phony capitalism and we have a highly regulated market and most of those regulations are put on by the pharmaceutical companies.
[03:19:57.689 --> 03:20:04.154]  They want the FDA to have those kind of restrictions on there because they want to keep competition out of their market.
[03:20:04.534 --> 03:20:10.739]  Stay with us, we'll be right back and we'll have an update on how CNN is spinning the Ebola news about the British nurse.

[03:23:54.396 --> 03:23:57.517]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.

[03:24:17.882 --> 03:24:19.283]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:19.343 --> 03:24:21.004]  I'm David Knight, your host this hour.
[03:24:21.104 --> 03:24:27.169]  Coming up in the next segment, we'll be talking to a Planned Parenthood whistleblower, Abby Johnson.
[03:24:28.209 --> 03:24:38.336]  And of course, if you haven't heard the news, CNN is announcing that Lois Lerner and nobody at the IRS will be charged for targeting political groups.
[03:24:38.496 --> 03:24:42.219]  That's because we've got a government by criminals and for criminals.
[03:24:43.584 --> 03:24:50.446]  Hillary Clinton, one of the things that came out in the Benghazi trial yesterday was the fact that she says, I didn't even have a computer in my State Department office.
[03:24:50.566 --> 03:25:01.929]  She says, most of my work was done, most of the work was not done on emails with my closest aides, with officials in the State Department, officials in the rest of the world, as well as the White House and people around the world.
[03:25:01.949 --> 03:25:03.589]  In other words, world, world, world.
[03:25:04.129 --> 03:25:05.830]  Ignore the email issues here.
[03:25:05.870 --> 03:25:07.510]  Look, of course they don't use emails.
[03:25:08.010 --> 03:25:09.211]  Remember when we were in
[03:25:10.431 --> 03:25:17.877]  Uh, at Bilderberg in Copenhagen and we saw Ed Balls who was the shadow chancellor of the Exchequer that would be
[03:25:18.957 --> 03:25:33.681]  Essentially, we don't have shadow people put in particular offices here in the United States, but if the Republicans who are out of office, if they wanted to put up an opposition or a shadow Secretary of the Treasury, that would be the equivalent position.
[03:25:33.721 --> 03:25:43.084]  Well, Ed Balls chose up to Bilderberg, and he's got a carry-on luggage bag that he's wheeling through there that is full of papers.
[03:25:43.991 --> 03:25:50.334]  Now, you look at this and you say, well, you know, why doesn't Ed Ball just put all that on a little tiny laptop, you know, or an iPad or something?
[03:25:50.354 --> 03:25:59.759]  You know, he could have his notes there, he could show people, he might even impress his fellow Bilderberg attendees with some kind of really cool PowerPoint display or something, right?
[03:26:00.695 --> 03:26:05.500]  No, these people don't like to put stuff on computers because they get hacked.
[03:26:06.060 --> 03:26:10.524]  So they walk around with their little suitcases full of paperwork.
[03:26:11.065 --> 03:26:15.789]  And as he was trying to come in, they were asking him for his credentials.
[03:26:15.849 --> 03:26:17.151]  He couldn't find his credentials.
[03:26:17.931 --> 03:26:24.757]  And he starts going through his bag and my wife was there taking pictures of him and he's fumbling and all this stuff is falling out of his suitcase.
[03:26:24.777 --> 03:26:31.443]  You can see he's got an entire suitcase filled with paper documents for his co-conspirators at Bilderberg.
[03:26:31.803 --> 03:26:32.804]  And that's the way this works.
[03:26:33.325 --> 03:26:40.110]  You know, I mean, why should we be concerned, for example, of the CIA when somebody hacks the director's emails?
[03:26:41.215 --> 03:26:42.696]  And takes a look at what he's gotten.
[03:26:42.716 --> 03:26:46.878]  Of course, he's got a lot of personal emails under there, but listen to something that came out of one of these emails.
[03:26:47.799 --> 03:26:51.801]  One of the things attached to these emails was communication that was
[03:26:52.737 --> 03:27:06.745]  Reflecting government communications, he says, everyone we spoke with on the ground in Afghanistan, this is a memo from Lewis Tucker, who is a minority staff director for the Senate Intelligence Committee, Vice Chairman Christopher Kitt Bond.
[03:27:06.845 --> 03:27:16.911]  Okay, so these are people who are working on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and he sends an email to CIA Director John Brennan, and this email is hacked by a teenager.
[03:27:17.651 --> 03:27:19.432]  And this is what's attached to the email.
[03:27:19.912 --> 03:27:26.355]  Everyone we spoke with on the ground in Afghanistan and Pakistan confessed that they know of no overall U.S.
[03:27:26.415 --> 03:27:28.195]  government strategy for the region.
[03:27:28.916 --> 03:27:37.399]  Rather, we observed quality individuals serving judiciously in their own lanes, ungoverned by a coordinated, comprehensive strategy.
[03:27:37.419 --> 03:27:39.880]  In other words, nobody knows what's going on here.
[03:27:40.621 --> 03:27:44.402]  We don't have any strategy in Afghanistan or in Pakistan.
[03:27:44.722 --> 03:27:45.743]  Well, they don't need a strategy.
[03:27:46.462 --> 03:27:47.223]  They don't need a goal.
[03:27:47.703 --> 03:27:51.166]  Their only strategy, their only goal is endless war.
[03:27:51.866 --> 03:27:54.168]  Endless war for the military-industrial complex.
[03:27:54.949 --> 03:27:59.212]  It's interesting that we see them confessing this, but of course they only do that privately.
[03:27:59.652 --> 03:28:01.474]  That's one of the reasons why they try to hide everything.
[03:28:02.054 --> 03:28:04.436]  That's one of the reasons why they have their own separate servers.
[03:28:04.456 --> 03:28:13.243]  You can only imagine what was on some of the 30,000 emails that were deleted by Hillary Clinton, and maybe they will find those, maybe they won't.
[03:28:13.843 --> 03:28:17.204]  Certainly looks like the Obama administration doesn't want the FBI to look.
[03:28:17.224 --> 03:28:19.045]  They're sending out all kinds of signals saying that.
[03:28:19.445 --> 03:28:28.947]  And of course they're giving the IRS a pass on something that is orders of magnitude greater than what Richard Nixon was impeached for.
[03:28:29.047 --> 03:28:37.210]  So we now have a criminal kleptocracy that allows anything to go if you are well connected enough.
[03:28:37.890 --> 03:28:41.092]  And one of the ways that they do this, of course, is by spending information in the media.
[03:28:41.112 --> 03:28:44.595]  A good example of this is a story about the UK Ebola nurse, Cafferkey.
[03:28:45.375 --> 03:28:47.777]  This is a British nurse that was given a clean bill of health.
[03:28:47.977 --> 03:28:50.519]  She had contracted Ebola while she was treating people in Africa.
[03:28:50.539 --> 03:28:53.101]  She was given a clean bill of health last January.
[03:28:53.761 --> 03:28:55.903]  Then she had a relapse nine months later.
[03:28:56.946 --> 03:28:59.028]  News organizations all over the world were talking about it.
[03:28:59.048 --> 03:29:01.370]  She nearly died about a week ago.
[03:29:01.991 --> 03:29:03.252]  And then she began to get better.
[03:29:03.312 --> 03:29:06.355]  She's now in a serious condition, but she was in critical condition.
[03:29:06.395 --> 03:29:07.076]  She almost died.
[03:29:07.516 --> 03:29:08.737]  She got meningitis.
[03:29:09.558 --> 03:29:14.863]  And the news about that was, hey, she never really was cleared of Ebola.
[03:29:15.463 --> 03:29:17.585]  And as they started talking to scientists, they said, yeah,
[03:29:18.306 --> 03:29:23.670]  We found that there was a case of sexual transmission of Ebola because it hides out in sexual organs.
[03:29:23.750 --> 03:29:25.372]  It hid out in a man's semen.
[03:29:25.412 --> 03:29:28.174]  He transmitted it to a woman seven months later.
[03:29:29.114 --> 03:29:30.335]  She subsequently died.
[03:29:30.375 --> 03:29:31.656]  They found it in a doctor's eye.
[03:29:31.676 --> 03:29:33.358]  But this is the way CNN spends it.
[03:29:33.398 --> 03:29:37.401]  They say, UK Ebola nurse was suffering from meningitis, not from a relapse.
[03:29:37.881 --> 03:29:38.322]  In other words,
[03:29:39.002 --> 03:29:43.606]  They say the meningitis was caused by Ebola, but not by the virus itself.
[03:29:43.926 --> 03:29:46.328]  That's kind of like saying nobody ever died of Ebola.
[03:29:46.348 --> 03:29:51.052]  They died of dehydration, or they died of a heart attack, but they didn't die from Ebola.
[03:29:51.192 --> 03:29:52.313]  That's what they're telling us.
[03:29:52.853 --> 03:29:57.497]  And yet, the reality that they don't want you to see is that the Ebola continued.
[03:29:57.517 --> 03:29:58.778]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:29:59.158 --> 03:30:00.059]  We're on the march.
[03:30:00.560 --> 03:30:02.161]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.102 --> 03:30:05.784]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.830 --> 03:30:16.495]  Hillary Clinton will testify in front of the Benghazi committee, and of course, she's going to try and spin this as just partisan politics.
[03:30:16.775 --> 03:30:17.916]  But let's look at the facts.
[03:30:18.236 --> 03:30:18.897]  They lied.
[03:30:19.157 --> 03:30:29.084]  One of the first moves the Obama administration made after the Benghazi attack was to contact YouTube in an apparent attempt to blame the attack on an obscure Pastor John video.
[03:30:29.244 --> 03:30:32.627]  This is according to State Department documents obtained by Judicial Watch.
[03:30:32.967 --> 03:30:41.334]  Later, the administration famously claimed the attack was provoked by another YouTube video, Innocence of Muslims, made by an Egyptian-born filmmaker.
[03:30:41.694 --> 03:30:50.262]  While they were plotting an enormous lie on the public, former Navy SEAL David Ubin was still trapped on the roof of the Benghazi annex for 20 hours.
[03:30:50.762 --> 03:30:54.946]  The Obama administration later jailed the filmmaker behind Innocence of Muslims.
[03:30:55.346 --> 03:31:00.991]  In fact, he was the only man who's been captured and imprisoned in the aftermath of the Benghazi terrorist attack.
[03:31:01.351 --> 03:31:03.833]  What difference at this point does it make?

[03:31:09.757 --> 03:31:13.359]  As any regular listener knows, I don't script what I have to say.
[03:31:13.619 --> 03:31:18.122]  I do my research, and then I tell it like it is, and let the chips fall where they may.
[03:31:18.262 --> 03:31:19.523]  And I'm gonna do that right now.
[03:31:20.043 --> 03:31:25.427]  I have never, in my 20 years on air, seen a time where it's more important to be prepared.
[03:31:25.687 --> 03:31:30.230]  Even most mainline analysts are now saying, we've entered this critical juncture.
[03:31:30.390 --> 03:31:31.991]  We've got to get prepared.
[03:31:32.231 --> 03:31:35.012]  Everyone knows I'm obsessed with win-win situations.

[03:32:07.954 --> 03:32:12.699]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:32:12.999 --> 03:32:17.824]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[03:32:17.824 --> 03:32:18.264]  I don't know.
[03:32:39.412 --> 03:32:40.333]  BrainForce is here.
[03:32:40.513 --> 03:32:42.614]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:32:42.714 --> 03:32:47.458]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:32:47.718 --> 03:32:49.359]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[03:32:49.419 --> 03:32:50.860]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:32:51.000 --> 03:32:54.223]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:32:54.483 --> 03:32:56.304]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:32:56.464 --> 03:32:57.365]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[03:32:57.385 --> 03:32:58.365]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:32:58.586 --> 03:33:00.467]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[03:33:11.141 --> 03:33:16.210]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.570 --> 03:33:18.854]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:33:22.543 --> 03:33:23.844]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.924 --> 03:33:32.413]  I'm David Knight, your host, and joining us now is Abby Johnson, a Planned Parenthood whistleblower, and I appreciate you coming on.
[03:33:33.053 --> 03:33:34.595]  You just got off of a plane, Abby.
[03:33:34.615 --> 03:33:44.865]  I appreciate you coming here to the studio on such short notice and fighting traffic, getting here just in the nick of time, as you just walked into the studio right now.
[03:33:45.325 --> 03:34:00.904]  And I want to ask her to comment on what's going on here in Texas because in Texas we've had the Attorney General as well as the Governor, they've raided several Planned Parenthood organizations looking for records doing an investigation.
[03:34:01.004 --> 03:34:03.665]  Imagine that, doing an investigation of criminal actions.
[03:34:03.685 --> 03:34:06.626]  You're not going to see that happening from the federal government.
[03:34:07.486 --> 03:34:11.788]  So I want to ask her to comment on that, because it's not happening just here in Texas.
[03:34:11.828 --> 03:34:14.108]  This is something that's happening in multiple states.
[03:34:14.168 --> 03:34:15.869]  Before we do, I just want to go back.
[03:34:15.909 --> 03:34:21.091]  We ran out of time at the last segment talking about the way CNN was spinning this Ebola thing.
[03:34:21.111 --> 03:34:22.831]  And this is very important to understand.
[03:34:25.052 --> 03:34:30.297]  Caller who called in last week and said, you have to understand Ebola is a virus.
[03:34:30.397 --> 03:34:33.560]  It's not going to ever really truly leave your system.
[03:34:33.601 --> 03:34:41.348]  And we learned because of the relapse of this nurse, nine months after she was given the okay, we learned that
[03:34:42.409 --> 03:34:45.091]  Of course it can hide out in your eye.
[03:34:45.251 --> 03:34:49.193]  It can hide out in your central nervous system, which is where it hid out in this nurse.
[03:34:49.233 --> 03:34:58.740]  It can hide out in the sexual reproductive organs and has been passed on and fatally passed on to someone else in Africa.
[03:34:59.660 --> 03:35:02.080]  So this is something that people should be concerned about.
[03:35:02.100 --> 03:35:03.481]  They should know how this works.
[03:35:03.581 --> 03:35:07.241]  And yet, the government, and especially the mainstream media, does not want you to know that.
[03:35:07.562 --> 03:35:12.022]  So they spin it with this headline and say, well, she was suffering from meningitis, it wasn't a relapse.
[03:35:12.803 --> 03:35:17.003]  I'm sorry, but, you know, it was from Ebola, and they admitted that it was from Ebola.
[03:35:17.243 --> 03:35:19.704]  And listen to how they report it in the body of the article.
[03:35:19.744 --> 03:35:25.265]  They say the UK nurse is suffering meningitis caused by Ebola, not the virus itself, say doctors.
[03:35:26.665 --> 03:35:28.286]  I mean, talk about doublespeak.
[03:35:28.466 --> 03:35:30.307]  And this is what the UK health official said.
[03:35:30.667 --> 03:35:33.608]  They said it was an unusual late complication.
[03:35:34.249 --> 03:35:36.250]  Yeah, a late complication.
[03:35:36.550 --> 03:35:43.673]  Like nine months after she was given the go-ahead and said she was completely clear and allowed to treat other people.
[03:35:43.793 --> 03:35:45.634]  That's what they don't want you to see.
[03:35:46.114 --> 03:35:53.938]  That's why they've had such a cavalier attitude about spreading this to the population, even to the extent that this nurse, Casey Hickox,
[03:35:54.838 --> 03:36:02.220]  Who went to Africa to treat patients there, came back in New Jersey, and she was quarantined by Chris Christie.
[03:36:02.260 --> 03:36:04.701]  Now she is suing Chris Christie for quarantining her.
[03:36:05.081 --> 03:36:12.063]  And I guess my question would be, if you're concerned about people's health, if you don't want people to get Ebola, why wouldn't you quarantine yourself?
[03:36:12.543 --> 03:36:14.965]  As a courtesy to other people, as a concern to other people.
[03:36:15.186 --> 03:36:17.327]  She goes to Africa to help people with Ebola.
[03:36:17.708 --> 03:36:20.590]  Why wouldn't she try to keep that from spreading here?
[03:36:20.630 --> 03:36:23.153]  Why wouldn't she voluntarily quarantine herself?
[03:36:23.253 --> 03:36:24.354]  It's absolutely amazing to me.
[03:36:24.374 --> 03:36:26.876]  It's one of the first times I've ever seen Chris Christie get something right.
[03:36:27.316 --> 03:36:28.818]  And he is sued for doing it.
[03:36:29.618 --> 03:36:30.179]  So here we go.
[03:36:30.860 --> 03:36:33.362]  Let's go to what's happening with Planned Parenthood.
[03:36:33.402 --> 03:36:35.143]  And thank you for joining us, Abby Johnson.
[03:36:35.163 --> 03:36:35.644]  Yeah, of course.
[03:36:35.664 --> 03:36:38.366]  Of course you've been a, you were a manager at Planned Parenthood.
[03:36:38.386 --> 03:36:38.747]  Yep.
[03:36:39.368 --> 03:36:44.660]  And we've talked before about how you saw things developing at Planned Parenthood.
[03:36:44.680 --> 03:36:46.344]  Just recap that briefly for people.
[03:36:46.846 --> 03:36:47.386]  Sure, yeah.
[03:36:47.406 --> 03:36:48.126]  A couple things.
[03:36:48.827 --> 03:36:56.669]  One, they implemented an abortion quota for us and actually doubled the number of abortions that we were supposed to be selling to women every month.
[03:36:56.689 --> 03:36:58.589]  So that was the first thing.
[03:36:58.609 --> 03:37:11.473]  The second thing, though, what really caused me to leave was seeing a live ultrasound-guided abortion procedure take place where I saw a 13-week-old baby fighting and struggling for his life.
[03:37:12.593 --> 03:37:13.913]  At the hands of the abortionists.
[03:37:14.014 --> 03:37:19.255]  And I left and Planned Parenthood sued me because apparently they think it's illegal to become pro-life.
[03:37:20.295 --> 03:37:28.958]  But they lost and now I'm just doing everything I can to expose what's taking place inside of these abortion clinics.
[03:37:28.998 --> 03:37:33.539]  Not just Planned Parenthood, but certainly Planned Parenthood since they are our largest abortion chain.
[03:37:33.719 --> 03:37:34.139]  Sure, sure.
[03:37:34.379 --> 03:37:38.340]  And so what you saw there was that they were clearly operating for profit.
[03:37:38.440 --> 03:37:41.341]  They were pushing you to push procedures on people.
[03:37:41.641 --> 03:37:56.368]  And one of the things that we've seen in these undercover videos is that they are pushing women to sign these releases so that they can acquire parts that they've already talked to StemXpress and other people to know what it is that they want in terms of parts.
[03:37:56.448 --> 03:38:00.250]  We weren't even honest about what we were really doing.
[03:38:00.830 --> 03:38:03.311]  I mean, I was being paid.
[03:38:03.951 --> 03:38:09.254]  So for every woman that I got to consent to participate in this research,
[03:38:10.154 --> 03:38:11.575]  I got paid 20 bucks.
[03:38:12.055 --> 03:38:17.299]  So that certainly lends itself to manipulative or coercive language.
[03:38:17.639 --> 03:38:18.660]  Oh yeah, you incentivize it.
[03:38:18.740 --> 03:38:19.160]  Sure.
[03:38:19.240 --> 03:38:32.430]  I mean, yeah, oh you want to do this, this is nothing, it's going to help save the lives of other people when in actuality we know that fetal tissue hasn't had any major medical breakthroughs since the inception of the research.
[03:38:32.850 --> 03:38:35.051]  And they can do stem cell research on adult stem cells.
[03:38:35.071 --> 03:38:35.271]  Yes!
[03:38:35.591 --> 03:38:37.152]  They don't need to have the baby stem cells.
[03:38:37.192 --> 03:38:45.675]  That's right, and there actually have been significant medical breakthroughs because of adult stem cells, which is always harvested in an ethical way.
[03:38:47.016 --> 03:38:54.019]  And of course, there's this article here, I didn't cover it in the news, but a blood test that allows couples to screen out what they call abnormalities.
[03:38:54.079 --> 03:38:57.700]  This is a Spanish firm, iGenomics, has made a compatibility test.
[03:38:57.760 --> 03:38:59.461]  It costs about 1,800 pounds.
[03:38:59.941 --> 03:39:02.242]  It's available in Britain, so I guess you can
[03:39:02.822 --> 03:39:07.245]  If it's abnormalities or if it's maybe hair color.
[03:39:07.305 --> 03:39:11.488]  You want a different baby with a different hair color, different sex or whatever, just have an abortion.
[03:39:11.768 --> 03:39:13.969]  Yeah, feels a little Aryan to me.
[03:39:13.989 --> 03:39:16.411]  A little Hitler-esque.
[03:39:16.471 --> 03:39:18.412]  Designer babies getting what you want.
[03:39:18.732 --> 03:39:19.153]  Exactly.
[03:39:19.213 --> 03:39:22.636]  That's where this is essentially going to lead.
[03:39:22.656 --> 03:39:25.959]  And of course, we have seen that in the history of Planned Parenthood as well.
[03:39:26.059 --> 03:39:29.362]  We've seen that it was targeted to certain groups.
[03:39:29.422 --> 03:39:31.284]  Targeted to the black community, of course.
[03:39:31.324 --> 03:39:33.486]  Margaret Sanger was very clear about that.
[03:39:33.866 --> 03:39:36.728]  I want to get your comment before we talk about what's going on here in the state of Texas.
[03:39:37.469 --> 03:39:56.671]  About this recent article from Politico, talking about how the raw video has now been leaked out of a House committee, and they were telling everybody, hey, don't pay any attention to these videos from the Center for Medical Progress, don't pay any attention to that, because those have been heavily edited, and yet they don't want the raw footage out there either.
[03:39:57.632 --> 03:39:59.373]  Yeah, I mean, that's the thing.
[03:39:59.854 --> 03:40:02.917]  If they've got nothing to hide, then who cares, right?
[03:40:03.017 --> 03:40:11.405]  Why go to these extreme lengths to make sure that the videos don't come out if everything they're doing is to help the general public through the research?
[03:40:11.445 --> 03:40:13.127]  I mean, and that's kind of the thing.
[03:40:13.167 --> 03:40:19.393]  I mean, I guess I worked in Planned Parenthood media for a while, but I mean, I've just been thinking the whole time, why don't they just come out and say,
[03:40:20.214 --> 03:40:21.635]  Yeah, we do this.
[03:40:22.176 --> 03:40:22.837]  Yep, we do it.
[03:40:22.957 --> 03:40:27.421]  Yep, we have cavalier conversations about aborting babies at dinner.
[03:40:27.501 --> 03:40:31.725]  Yep, that is absolutely what we do, and that's part of our work.
[03:40:32.065 --> 03:40:35.308]  And we're proud of it because we are proud to perform abortions.
[03:40:35.669 --> 03:40:42.855]  I mean, that's really what they should just come out and say instead of trying to hide it and suppress it and, you know, make all of these excuses.
[03:40:42.915 --> 03:40:43.416]  Just come on out!
[03:40:43.776 --> 03:40:55.484]  I mean, if you're really proud of what you do, if you really believe abortion is this great service, if you really believe that harvesting fetal tissue from these aborted babies is a good thing, then just own it and be proud of it.
[03:40:55.845 --> 03:40:57.446]  Yeah, some of them do actually.
[03:40:59.467 --> 03:41:02.348]  That's actually really creepy when you see that happen.
[03:41:02.789 --> 03:41:05.490]  Talk to us about what's going on here in the state of Texas.
[03:41:05.510 --> 03:41:07.951]  Of course, this is something that's going on in multiple states.
[03:41:07.971 --> 03:41:13.313]  We're not seeing any real investigation at the federal level in spite of the fact this committee is looking at these videos.
[03:41:15.174 --> 03:41:18.217]  That's the only thing that we've seen, and of course that's the Republican Committee who's doing that.
[03:41:18.258 --> 03:41:23.043]  The Justice Department is not doing any investigation to see if they violated U.S.
[03:41:23.123 --> 03:41:33.914]  law by negotiating for organ parts, or if they are performing late-term abortions, as we see in these videos, because they want more fully developed body parts.
[03:41:33.934 --> 03:41:36.117]  Those would all be violations of existing law.
[03:41:36.710 --> 03:41:42.576]  They're just, they're starting to look at that in the House Committee, but they're not, the Obama administration and the Department of Justice are not looking at that.
[03:41:42.797 --> 03:41:44.599]  But we do have some states that are looking at that.
[03:41:44.639 --> 03:41:45.460]  Tell us about Texas.
[03:41:46.080 --> 03:41:47.482]  Yeah, it's been really exciting actually.
[03:41:47.502 --> 03:41:54.950]  You know, we had already defunded, in the state of Texas, we had already defunded Planned Parenthood of $29 million, but there was still like $2.5 million left.
[03:41:57.252 --> 03:42:00.353]  And, you know, we just kept being told we just can't pull it.
[03:42:00.433 --> 03:42:04.214]  CMS will come in and, you know, they'll shut down your whole Medicaid program.
[03:42:04.494 --> 03:42:10.315]  But certainly, there has to be some allowance for a state to say, you're breaking the law.
[03:42:11.315 --> 03:42:13.876]  We don't want you as part of our Medicaid program, right?
[03:42:13.916 --> 03:42:18.317]  But you've got to have pretty solid evidence that they are breaking the law.
[03:42:20.362 --> 03:42:31.075]  The Office of the Investigator General, which by the way we have a new IG, Stuart Bowen, amazing man, really on top of this, and it's not just that he's, you know, well I'm pro-life so I want to shut down Planned Parenthood, he's like...
[03:42:32.329 --> 03:42:38.734]  I want to make sure that we are being responsible with taxpayer dollars here in the state of Texas.
[03:42:39.654 --> 03:42:42.296]  And he's really going about it the right way.
[03:42:43.517 --> 03:42:55.265]  You know, he started looking at, we've got three whistleblower lawsuits, mine is one of them, from former Planned Parenthood workers stating Medicaid fraud.
[03:42:55.705 --> 03:42:58.887]  Very, I mean, serious Medicaid fraud.
[03:42:59.367 --> 03:43:01.429]  If my case goes to court and we win,
[03:43:02.429 --> 03:43:06.551]  The affiliate that I worked with, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, they're going to be fined about $600 million.
[03:43:06.591 --> 03:43:07.011]  Wow.
[03:43:07.792 --> 03:43:09.552]  This is big money, okay?
[03:43:10.273 --> 03:43:11.373]  And this is our money.
[03:43:12.334 --> 03:43:18.436]  And so, you know, basically the OIG said, look, we're going to look into this.
[03:43:19.217 --> 03:43:23.418]  You know, we have the videos showing this, but we need some hard proof.
[03:43:23.539 --> 03:43:26.220]  And these former clinic workers have that hard proof.
[03:43:27.100 --> 03:43:32.644]  And so they've been looking through, you know, our complaints, our allegations, our cases.
[03:43:33.605 --> 03:43:40.149]  And then they finally, they went in there, they stepped foot in there and said, we're taking the records we need.
[03:43:40.470 --> 03:43:41.750]  And surprise, surprise.
[03:43:42.711 --> 03:43:46.334]  The only affiliate that wasn't cooperative was Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast.
[03:43:46.774 --> 03:43:48.035]  And that happened out of Houston.
[03:43:48.075 --> 03:43:51.577]  That happens to be where all three of the former employees came from.
[03:43:52.438 --> 03:43:53.959]  So they don't want to be cooperative.
[03:43:53.999 --> 03:43:55.340]  They don't want us to see what's going on.
[03:43:55.500 --> 03:43:56.701]  So you say they weren't cooperative.
[03:43:56.721 --> 03:43:57.241]  What did they do?
[03:43:57.662 --> 03:44:01.104]  Well, they were trying to prevent the OIG from getting the records.
[03:44:01.224 --> 03:44:03.045]  But, I mean, they have the power.
[03:44:03.406 --> 03:44:06.728]  They're part of the Medicaid contract, so they have the power to get whatever they want.
[03:44:07.253 --> 03:44:16.299]  And of course, that's legitimate if it's part of, if somebody accuses them of wrongdoing, it would be negligent on the part of the Attorney General not to investigate it.
[03:44:16.499 --> 03:44:17.219]  Absolutely.
[03:44:17.279 --> 03:44:19.020]  And so that's what we see repeatedly.
[03:44:19.621 --> 03:44:24.143]  Yet they talk about this as if they're being targeted unfairly, unjustly.
[03:44:24.243 --> 03:44:26.184]  We heard the same thing about the videos themselves.
[03:44:26.365 --> 03:44:28.926]  Oh, you know, they came in, they lied to people about this.
[03:44:28.966 --> 03:44:31.728]  I think it's like, no, if you have, it's not entrapment.
[03:44:32.208 --> 03:44:39.815]  If somebody has said something is happening here, and you do an undercover investigation, the FBI does that kind of stuff all the time, and it's not entrapment.
[03:44:39.855 --> 03:44:53.467]  If somebody says, hey, there's a crime being committed here, you need to investigate this, then it's legitimate to go in and do an undercover investigation, even if you represent yourself as that's the only way that they do most of these investigations.
[03:44:53.547 --> 03:44:56.870]  And so that kind of investigation, going in and looking at the records,
[03:44:57.530 --> 03:44:58.330]  Oh, poor Planned Parenthood.
[03:44:58.350 --> 03:44:59.511]  Poor billion dollar non-profit.
[03:45:14.935 --> 03:45:20.419]  That's just what's so disingenuous about the whole thing is Planned Parenthood, they love to play the victim.
[03:45:20.499 --> 03:45:23.641]  They need to play the victim in order to keep their support going.
[03:45:24.802 --> 03:45:31.527]  You know, we're just always trying to shut them down and, you know, poor us and we're always a target.
[03:45:31.567 --> 03:45:34.128]  Yeah, you are always a target because you're killing babies.
[03:45:35.309 --> 03:45:40.533]  And you are always a target because you're giving substandard health care to women who come into your facilities.
[03:45:40.653 --> 03:45:45.637]  And you are a target because you continue to promote and participate in the legal activity.
[03:45:45.657 --> 03:45:53.323]  Yeah, you better believe you're absolutely a target and you're going to continue to be a target until we can find enough evidence to shut you down permanently.
[03:45:53.823 --> 03:45:55.524]  You're talking about substandard health care.
[03:45:55.544 --> 03:46:07.354]  I mean one of the things that came to light in these undercover videos is the fact that they would encourage the women to have a breech birth so they could get a better quote-unquote specimen as they termed the baby.
[03:46:07.918 --> 03:46:09.721]  Yeah, I mean, and that's not all.
[03:46:09.741 --> 03:46:23.221]  I mean, look, we've got, we have where I run an organization for abortion clinic workers so that they can leave and find hope and find healing and find a life-affirming job away from the abortion industry and, you know,
[03:46:24.042 --> 03:46:31.792]  The things that these workers are coming out and telling us that's going on inside the clinics, there was an inspection that we just got.
[03:46:31.912 --> 03:46:38.080]  Every six months we'll do a public information request and ask for the inspection reports because those are public records.
[03:46:38.580 --> 03:46:42.225]  So the inspectors that go into these abortion clinics and
[03:46:43.186 --> 03:46:49.790]  We get inspections back all the time that say they are not properly sterilizing instruments.
[03:46:50.030 --> 03:46:55.192]  These are instruments that are going inside a woman, that are being used woman to woman.
[03:46:55.773 --> 03:46:58.094]  They are not being properly sterilized.
[03:46:58.574 --> 03:47:04.457]  And this may be a problem that continues to happen year after year, yet these abortion clinics are still allowed to stay open.
[03:47:04.477 --> 03:47:05.017]  Wow.
[03:47:05.398 --> 03:47:09.440]  I mean, they are putting women at very serious risk.
[03:47:10.340 --> 03:47:12.041]  Uh, in very serious danger.
[03:47:12.061 --> 03:47:19.944]  And look at the way the Planned Parenthood apologist reacted to the laws that would try to correct that type of situation.
[03:47:19.964 --> 03:47:20.184]  Oh yeah.
[03:47:20.404 --> 03:47:23.225]  They said, oh you're just doing that because you don't want us to have abortions.
[03:47:23.305 --> 03:47:25.626]  And they're not concerned about women's health.
[03:47:26.086 --> 03:47:31.088]  It came out at the time, it was about that time that Joan Rivers died having plastic surgery.
[03:47:31.408 --> 03:47:39.113]  And they pointed out that if those same standards had been applied where she was having plastic surgery, then that wouldn't have happened to her.
[03:47:39.193 --> 03:47:40.113]  She would have survived.
[03:47:40.173 --> 03:47:42.795]  They would have had the kind of oversight that they needed with that.
[03:47:43.255 --> 03:47:46.137]  But they're not concerned about women's health.
[03:47:46.297 --> 03:47:48.958]  They're just concerned about having more abortions.
[03:47:49.018 --> 03:47:51.720]  And you can see it from their resistance to this legislation.
[03:47:52.060 --> 03:48:00.986]  Oh yeah, I mean, and what's so pathetic is that these clinics, they can't even keep up with the very minimum standards that are in place right now.
[03:48:02.627 --> 03:48:04.308]  But they say that they care about women?
[03:48:04.448 --> 03:48:09.892]  They're not even properly sterilizing their instruments, but they're trying to convince me that they care about women?
[03:48:10.532 --> 03:48:23.401]  I mean, gosh, you've got women coming in there who are HIV positive, who have other sexually transmitted... I mean, serious diseases, and they're not even properly cleaning the instruments that are going inside one woman and the next?
[03:48:23.421 --> 03:48:25.182]  I mean, that is disgusting.
[03:48:25.242 --> 03:48:27.544]  They don't have... We just got one inspection back.
[03:48:27.784 --> 03:48:35.490]  All of their life-saving equipment, their airway equipment, all of that, the defibrillator, all of that, had not been inspected since 2010.
[03:48:37.970 --> 03:48:41.531]  I mean, God forbid a woman actually needed it, they pull it out, it doesn't even work!
[03:48:42.191 --> 03:48:50.333]  I mean, I'm telling you, these clinics, they are so, they are, it is such poor care for women, and they're not even providing the services that they say they're providing.
[03:48:50.373 --> 03:48:54.714]  They're saying that they're providing all this comprehensive care for women, that's ridiculous.
[03:48:55.094 --> 03:49:03.636]  They are not providing half of the care that, probably they're not providing 75% of the care that their apologists are saying that they do.
[03:49:04.276 --> 03:49:05.697]  And if you try to tell them that,
[03:49:06.577 --> 03:49:09.540]  Oh, I mean, they just, they can't say it, they can't take it.
[03:49:09.700 --> 03:49:17.066]  They cannot take you trying to shut down their precious Planned Parenthood, even though there are better providers for them to go and see.
[03:49:17.386 --> 03:49:17.806]  Exactly.
[03:49:17.866 --> 03:49:25.673]  When they're talking about women's health, and that's the line they always come back, if you cut funding for Planned Parenthood, you're going to be cutting funding for women's health.
[03:49:26.053 --> 03:49:37.339]  But again, when we go back to it and we say, alright, we're concerned about women's health, we want to make sure that their equipment is up to date, that they have all these other things that, in case something goes wrong, they say, you just want to stop abortions.
[03:49:37.379 --> 03:49:40.461]  Because they know that's why they're supporting Planned Parenthood.
[03:49:40.861 --> 03:49:41.762]  Yeah, it was interesting.
[03:49:43.343 --> 03:49:47.085]  NARAL or NAF or one of the pro-abortion groups came out
[03:49:48.123 --> 03:49:55.525]  Not too long ago, they said it was like this shocking pro-lifers trying to shut down the abortion industry.
[03:49:55.645 --> 03:49:57.886]  And I thought, is that really shocking?
[03:49:58.526 --> 03:50:00.727]  Because yeah, that is exactly what we're trying to do.
[03:50:01.447 --> 03:50:04.888]  And you know, I don't want to cut women's health care.
[03:50:04.988 --> 03:50:11.730]  I want to make sure women are getting proper health care and comprehensive health care when they do go to a medical office.
[03:50:11.750 --> 03:50:13.471]  And they're not going to get that at Planned Parenthood.
[03:50:14.252 --> 03:50:15.553]  They're going to get dirty instruments.
[03:50:15.573 --> 03:50:17.515]  They're not even going to be seen by a doctor.
[03:50:17.616 --> 03:50:21.080]  There's not even a doctor in the building if you go to Planned Parenthood for health care.
[03:50:21.500 --> 03:50:23.363]  You know, I want to make sure that women are getting the best care.
[03:50:23.423 --> 03:50:27.868]  Here in the state of Texas alone, there are only 35 Planned Parenthood clinics.
[03:50:28.269 --> 03:50:33.114]  There are almost 5,000 providers for the Texas Women's Health Program.
[03:50:33.655 --> 03:50:36.237]  Where women can go to receive health care at no cost.
[03:50:36.457 --> 03:50:39.680]  I mean, we really don't need Planned Parenthood in the state of Texas.
[03:50:39.740 --> 03:50:41.562]  I mean, we have said that over and over again.
[03:50:41.582 --> 03:50:43.783]  Our legislators have proven it.
[03:50:43.864 --> 03:50:45.825]  We do not need these clinics in our state.
[03:50:46.906 --> 03:50:48.067]  Stay with us when we come back.
[03:50:48.147 --> 03:50:51.390]  We're talking about Planned Parenthood and government subsidies.
[03:50:51.430 --> 03:50:54.652]  And of course, it's not just federal subsidies, even state subsidies.
[03:50:54.712 --> 03:50:56.374]  It's also local subsidies.
[03:50:56.454 --> 03:50:58.536]  And we'll talk about a good example of that when we come back.
[03:50:58.756 --> 03:51:01.498]  We're talking to Abby Johnson, a Planned Parenthood whistleblower.
[03:51:01.518 --> 03:51:02.359]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:09.915 --> 03:51:14.078]  Do you lay awake at night and worry about the health and safety of you and your loved ones?
[03:51:14.298 --> 03:51:18.141]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[03:51:18.381 --> 03:51:23.485]  How can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens that are beginning to emerge in the world today?
[03:51:23.825 --> 03:51:26.947]  Give yourself peace of mind with Supernatural Silver.
[03:51:27.408 --> 03:51:34.313]  Supernatural Silver is turning heads around the world as a new weapon in the fight against bacteria, viruses, and fungus.
[03:51:34.913 --> 03:51:42.699]  Supernatural silver can be taken internally or used topically to help the body's own immune system fight off disease much more effectively.
[03:51:43.159 --> 03:51:49.744]  Supernatural silver has been tested at independent universities and laboratories around the world and has been proven to be safe and effective.
[03:51:49.944 --> 03:51:53.246]  And highly effective against some of the planet's deadliest pathogens.
[03:51:53.826 --> 03:51:58.408]  There is no better product to have in your home for daily use or emergency preparedness.
[03:51:58.828 --> 03:52:09.133]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com, use the code SILVER2015 for 20% off, and give yourself and your loved ones a fighting chance with Supernatural Silver.
[03:52:09.913 --> 03:52:14.015]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[03:52:14.135 --> 03:52:18.318]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[03:52:18.338 --> 03:52:25.622]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[03:52:25.802 --> 03:52:36.294]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[03:52:36.454 --> 03:52:39.777]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[03:52:39.978 --> 03:52:40.999]  What do you have to lose?
[03:52:41.099 --> 03:52:43.782]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and
[03:52:43.902 --> 03:52:45.703]  You wouldn't go swimming with sharks without a cage, would you?
[03:53:13.405 --> 03:53:13.625]  Hey!
[03:53:13.785 --> 03:53:15.106]  Has anyone seen Larry?
[03:53:16.367 --> 03:53:20.610]  It's in our nature to protect ourselves, especially when protection is simple and affordable.
[03:53:20.871 --> 03:53:26.735]  That's why IDStronghold.com has been providing affordable RFID protection for over 10 years.
[03:53:27.155 --> 03:53:37.003]  ID Stronghold wallets protect you from electronic pickpockets who pass near you with a scanner and steal your credit and debit card info, as well as data from other cards containing RFID chips.
[03:53:37.423 --> 03:53:45.746]  IDStronghold.com, the original maker of shielded wallets, is a technology company, so we understand how to best protect you against intrusive radio waves.
[03:53:46.006 --> 03:53:52.048]  ID Stronghold wallets are designed to block RFID signals, open or closed, no matter where on the wallet you put your cards.
[03:53:52.248 --> 03:53:58.190]  Most other RFID wallets on the market were designed with only fashion in mind, and don't shield properly, if at all.
[03:53:58.430 --> 03:54:04.238]  If you're shopping for your next wallet, be sure to get the protection you deserve by going to IVStronghold.com.
[03:54:04.319 --> 03:54:07.964]  Because getting anything else is like being the next victim in a Jaws movie.
[03:54:22.648 --> 03:54:24.088]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:24.108 --> 03:54:26.609]  On our final segment, we have Abby Johnson with us.
[03:54:26.629 --> 03:54:35.832]  She's a Planned Parenthood whistleblower, a former manager at a Planned Parenthood facility in Houston, and I want to talk to her about funding at the local level.
[03:54:35.872 --> 03:54:39.633]  Before we do, I just want to let you know that we have Supermail Vitality back in stock.
[03:54:40.333 --> 03:54:49.259]  And we also have 15% off of Ancient Defense, as well as 10% off the complete InfoWars Select Storable Food line, and that includes free shipping.
[03:54:49.620 --> 03:54:54.083]  And that's where there's a huge saving when you buy your food with free shipping.
[03:54:54.143 --> 03:55:02.108]  Again, 10% off of all InfoWars Select Storable Food line, 15% off Ancient Defense, and Super Mail Vitality is back in stock.
[03:55:02.689 --> 03:55:08.253]  Now, Abby, as we were talking about efforts to try to limit funding, and of course it's been done at the state level here in Texas,
[03:55:09.346 --> 03:55:13.630]  There's also heavy subsidies at the local level that I think people aren't aware of.
[03:55:13.810 --> 03:55:15.092]  Austin is a very good example.
[03:55:15.172 --> 03:55:18.535]  Tell us what's going on here in Austin with local subsidy of Planned Parenthood.
[03:55:18.775 --> 03:55:21.618]  Yeah, Austin is, you know, they have before.
[03:55:21.638 --> 03:55:25.542]  They've funded Planned Parenthood locally before and then they stopped.
[03:55:25.602 --> 03:55:26.723]  Now they're back to doing it.
[03:55:27.223 --> 03:55:31.247]  Another thing I think people don't realize is there's a building
[03:55:32.288 --> 03:55:33.788]  Downtown in Austin.
[03:55:34.409 --> 03:55:41.710]  The rent for a building like this, for the square footage, would probably go for, you know, I don't know, maybe $4,000 to $5,000 a month.
[03:55:43.011 --> 03:55:51.633]  The city of Austin, for years, for at least 20, 30 years, has been renting that building to Planned Parenthood for a dollar a year.
[03:55:53.379 --> 03:55:55.279]  I mean, that's a huge subsidy.
[03:55:55.760 --> 03:55:57.240]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:55:57.260 --> 03:56:02.561]  And then, you know, part of our local taxes, they want that to go to Planned Parenthood.
[03:56:02.621 --> 03:56:13.404]  And, you know, I mean, I have to say, I remember when we were moving to this area and we were looking at, you know, where we wanted to buy a house, one of the things that we looked at was, you know,
[03:56:14.424 --> 03:56:17.926]  Is the local government there giving subsidies to Planned Parenthood?
[03:56:17.946 --> 03:56:20.528]  At that time when we moved here, Travis County was.
[03:56:20.568 --> 03:56:21.528]  The city of Austin was.
[03:56:22.029 --> 03:56:32.995]  And so we ended up moving intentionally, moved more north into Williamson County because we didn't want any of our money going to Planned Parenthood at the local level.
[03:56:33.015 --> 03:56:35.116]  And I think people need to pay attention to that.
[03:56:35.136 --> 03:56:36.717]  People need to start paying attention to that.
[03:56:36.737 --> 03:56:38.158]  Where is your local money going?
[03:56:38.658 --> 03:56:41.420]  Is it going to fund things like the abortion industry?
[03:56:41.700 --> 03:56:42.741]  And here in Austin it is.
[03:56:43.061 --> 03:56:45.103]  I think most people wouldn't even think to look for that.
[03:56:45.604 --> 03:56:48.166]  You know how the system works because you worked at a Planned Parenthood.
[03:56:48.206 --> 03:56:55.935]  Most people wouldn't even imagine that they're getting a several thousand square foot facility for a dollar a year in Austin.
[03:56:56.095 --> 03:56:59.678]  That is absolutely amazing and that shows just how much
[03:57:01.061 --> 03:57:05.925]  How politically connected they are, that people would give them this kind of subsidy.
[03:57:06.025 --> 03:57:16.435]  And I think a lot of people, even people that might support abortion, many libertarians, would look at this and say, wait a minute, why are we giving these people that much of a subsidy?
[03:57:16.795 --> 03:57:17.716]  For their business.
[03:57:17.776 --> 03:57:26.141]  I mean, the same type of thing we look at with sports stadiums, where you've got these multi-billionaires come in with their sports team and you build a billion-dollar stadium for them.
[03:57:26.161 --> 03:57:29.123]  I mean, we see this kind of crony capitalism at every level.
[03:57:29.523 --> 03:57:31.224]  And certainly it's there with Planned Parenthood.
[03:57:31.244 --> 03:57:33.326]  I think a lot of people need to look at that at the local level.
[03:57:33.906 --> 03:57:36.608]  So, we're going to be talking tonight on the Nightly News.
[03:57:36.668 --> 03:57:41.311]  Leanne McAdoo is going to be talking about the Texas raids of Planned Parenthood.
[03:57:42.213 --> 03:57:46.416]  There's also going to be an extended version of Alex storming Google.
[03:57:47.637 --> 03:57:56.003]  Don't miss that video because it's absolutely priceless to see the expression on people's faces when you put a camera and a microphone in their face.
[03:57:56.103 --> 03:58:03.169]  Even the guy who has a laptop in front of him with a camera and a microphone, he doesn't think about it until Alex does that.
[03:58:03.769 --> 03:58:06.792]  That is essentially what is happening to all of us.
[03:58:06.912 --> 03:58:09.735]  We're all being recorded, all the time, by Google.
[03:58:09.935 --> 03:58:16.181]  And that information now, with the passage of CISA, is going to be turned over to the government as the government wishes.
[03:58:16.321 --> 03:58:18.103]  That's what you need to be afraid of.
[03:58:18.363 --> 03:58:19.504]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:58:19.905 --> 03:58:22.267]  Abby Johnson, Planned Parenthood, Whistleblower.
[03:58:22.307 --> 03:58:24.469]  Join us tonight at 7 Central, 8pm Eastern.
[03:58:24.509 --> 03:58:26.191]  Leanne McAdoo will be doing the nightly news.
[03:58:51.319 --> 03:58:53.203]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:54.747 --> 03:58:56.932]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
