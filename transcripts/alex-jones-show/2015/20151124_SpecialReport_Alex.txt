[00:00:07.409 --> 00:00:07.769]  A U.S.
[00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:13.050]  high school student has reportedly hacked the private AOL account of CIA Director John Brennan.
[00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:23.472]  Everything from an application for a top-secret security clearance to details about the agency's harsh interrogation techniques have been uncovered, according to the New York Post.
[00:00:24.173 --> 00:00:34.775]  This all began back on October 12th, when the hacker said he was able to trick workers at Verizon into releasing personal information about Brennan and convincing AOL to reset his password.
[00:00:35.575 --> 00:00:43.239]  And of course, law enforcement agencies are not taking this lying down and would very much like to make an example out of the hacker and any of his associates.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.725]  The hacker added that he has also been prank calling Brennan repeatedly over the past two months, even reciting the CIA director's social security number to him during the calls.
[00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:58.408]  But the CIA director isn't the only person to fall victim to the security apparatus that he helped build.
[00:00:58.768 --> 00:01:03.552]  Former President Bush has had his personal pictures and paintings hacked by another source.
[00:01:03.892 --> 00:01:07.794]  Not to mention Dianne Feinstein, who was a strong proponent of you and I being spied on.
[00:01:08.114 --> 00:01:12.317]  But when she found out she was a victim of this as well, did not take this very lightly.
[00:01:12.637 --> 00:01:14.979]  Not to mention the drone that flew around her residence.
[00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:16.380]  She wasn't happy about that at all.
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.635]  So which is to say, all these people who are involved in building the security apparatus, it's only a matter of time before you fall victim to it yourself.

[00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:42.645]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.

[00:02:18.912 --> 00:02:22.794]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:02:23.274 --> 00:02:23.515]  I think so.
