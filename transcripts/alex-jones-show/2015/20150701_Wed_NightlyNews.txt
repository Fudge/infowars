[00:00:19.793 --> 00:00:21.876]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:22.877]  I'm your host Rob Dew.
[00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:25.361]  Today's date is Wednesday, July 1st, 2015.
[00:00:25.781 --> 00:00:27.864]  And here's a look at what's coming up.
[00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:29.066]  Excuse me!
[00:00:29.767 --> 00:00:31.790]  I'd like to ask you a few questions.
[00:00:35.051 --> 00:00:44.881]  Tonight, the fight against mandatory vaccines in California continues as concerned parents unite to recall the disastrous ruling.
[00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:52.048]  Meanwhile, Jim Carrey joins the fight by warning the public that vaccines are poisoning our children.
[00:00:52.068 --> 00:00:55.131]  I just want to start by asking the CDC one question.
[00:00:55.992 --> 00:00:58.114]  How stupid do you think we are?
[00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:00.818]  Plus, amazing drone footage.
[00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.345]  And is racist lightning responsible for burning down churches in the South?
[00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:10.109]  You'll find out up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.592]  I want to make this announcement now.
[00:01:26.713 --> 00:01:29.202]  It's going up as we speak a day earlier.

[00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.784]  I want to talk about a perfect storm today.
[00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:37.360]  And the perfect storm I'm going to discuss is a really good perfect storm.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:51.665]  I have prayed, literally, to be able to find a high quality gun sponsor that is affordable and that is extremely well made and effective that I can promote to my audience.
[00:02:52.185 --> 00:02:55.986]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:02:56.447 --> 00:02:57.767]  HDfirearms.com.
[00:02:58.147 --> 00:02:59.608]  Low cost compared to competitors.
[00:03:00.308 --> 00:03:06.429]  Super high quality, super lightweight, super accurate, and the experts salivate over it and love it.

[00:03:18.872 --> 00:03:24.053]  You need to go to HDFirearms.com today, or you can visit HeadDownProducts.com.
[00:03:24.193 --> 00:03:25.793]  That's HeadDownProducts.com.
[00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:35.475]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:36.396]  I'm your host, Rob Dew.
[00:03:36.757 --> 00:03:41.402]  Coming up, we're going to have a little debate and demonstration on drones, private versus government.
[00:03:41.422 --> 00:03:49.772]  And we're going to have a representative from SB277 Recalls to talk about some real solutions to get rid of this draconian forced vaccination bill.
[00:03:50.012 --> 00:03:50.533]  But first...
[00:03:50.973 --> 00:03:56.498]  We're going to talk about the rash of fires in the South of predominantly black churches.
[00:03:56.658 --> 00:03:58.320]  Is it all racially motivated?
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.465]  Is it all white people out there trying to get their digs in on black people after this horrible shooting that happened in South Carolina?
[00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:06.948]  Well, let's look at the first story here from NBC News.
[00:04:07.348 --> 00:04:11.111]  South Carolina black church, once torched by KKK, burns again.
[00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:18.516]  Fire officials in South Carolina were digging Wednesday through scorched wreckage of a historic black church gutted overnight under unknown circumstances.
[00:04:18.876 --> 00:04:25.840]  At a news conference Wednesday, investigators said they were still determining what caused the fire at Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.384]  Hard to say who might have come through here or what the cause of this was, you know, but we had problems here before, so...
[00:04:33.304 --> 00:04:34.445]  It really didn't go away.
[00:04:35.105 --> 00:04:35.745]  It's still here.
[00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:41.987]  The blaze at Mount Zion comes amid a rash of fires that have erupted at black churches all across the South in the past two weeks.
[00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:45.788]  Officials say at least two fires have already been declared arson.
[00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:53.451]  All of these recent fires have occurred in the weeks following the shooting at Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston on June 17th.
[00:04:53.631 --> 00:04:55.852]  A white gunman opened fire on a Bible study.
[00:04:56.331 --> 00:05:01.673]  And it wasn't just the Today Show that was insinuating that it was white people that burnt down this church.
[00:05:02.373 --> 00:05:05.274]  Once again, Twitter warriors were out in full effect.
[00:05:05.334 --> 00:05:06.514]  Here's an article from Steve Watson.
[00:05:14.482 --> 00:05:23.906]  In the wake of the Charleston shooting, so-called social justice warriors have played a huge role in promoting a contrived race war, because you know it's good and progressive to have everyone feeling divided and angry.
[00:05:24.566 --> 00:05:32.289]  The warriors have done what they do best in creating a hashtag, whoisburningblackchurches, with the clear insinuation that racist white supremacists are behind all the fires.
[00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:41.433]  In fact, here is a tweet from one Charles Wade, stop the passive language, fires aren't breaking out at black churches, black churches are being set on fire.
[00:05:42.415 --> 00:05:43.796]  But set on fire by whom?
[00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:45.417]  That's always the question.
[00:05:45.617 --> 00:05:52.061]  And especially when we don't have investigations even being conducted or completed at this point, you have people jumping to conclusions.
[00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:54.983]  Also today, National Review, church burnings.
[00:05:55.043 --> 00:05:57.164]  Falsified history repeats itself.
[00:05:57.564 --> 00:06:07.371]  And Michelle Malkin goes in to talk about how in 1990s there was a USA Today reporter, Gary Fields, who said there were 61 different church fires that looked suspicious, and they did a
[00:06:08.291 --> 00:06:08.671]  I don't
[00:06:30.337 --> 00:06:34.982]  One was touched off by an electrical short after a tree limb fell on the property, yanking the electrical service line.
[00:06:35.523 --> 00:06:39.787]  And one was involved, it was actually a white church and it was struck by lightning.
[00:06:39.807 --> 00:06:43.692]  And we're going to have more coming up talking about lightning.
[00:06:43.712 --> 00:06:47.476]  I'm going to be joined by Joe Biggs and Leanne McAdoo.
[00:06:47.896 --> 00:06:49.937]  But I want to go back to an older article.
[00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:57.763]  This is from Third World Traveler and it's a COINTELPRO The Untold American Story and this is the section on the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:06:57.803 --> 00:06:58.243]  It reads,
[00:07:18.356 --> 00:07:29.359]  44, however, Bureau intelligence assets were neither neutral observers nor objective investigators, but active participants in beatings, bombings, and murders that claimed the lives of some 50 civil rights activists by 1964.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.641]  Bureau spies were elected to top leadership posts and at least half of all Klan units.
[00:07:36.442 --> 00:07:42.190]  Needless to say, the informant gained positions of organizational trust on the basis of promoting the Klan's fascist agenda.
[00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:49.561]  Incitement to violence and participation in terrorist acts would only confirm the infiltrator's loyalty and commitment.
[00:07:50.578 --> 00:07:51.819]  And now, where does this lead us?
[00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:54.780]  The FBI has come out and said they've issued a report.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.382]  They're telling friends and family to avoid 4th of July celebrations.
[00:07:59.762 --> 00:08:00.762]  What does that all mean?
[00:08:00.802 --> 00:08:01.523]  That's interesting.
[00:08:01.883 --> 00:08:07.925]  And then I want to go back to a 2012 article from the New York Times, terrorist plots hatched by the FBI.
[00:08:08.225 --> 00:08:18.410]  I've got a one-minute clip here detailing some recent FBI shenanigans going on, and it ends with a clip from Judge Napolitano talking about this very same thing.
[00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:18.770]  Here it is.
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:25.024]  You've probably heard of the shooting at the Prophet Muhammad Cartoons Exhibition in Garland, Texas over the weekend.
[00:08:25.144 --> 00:08:31.568]  But did you know Daily Mail used pictures from the event, but bowing to political correctness, blacked out the offensive images?
[00:08:31.868 --> 00:08:35.211]  And thus far, President Barack Obama has been silent about the attacks.
[00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:40.835]  And CNN used the event to attack the Second Amendment, when it was the Second Amendment that stopped the gunmen in their tracks.
[00:08:41.095 --> 00:08:45.439]  But now we've learned that the FBI has been watching one of the suspects using an FBI informant.
[00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:52.105]  Elton Simpson, the man identified as one of the two gunmen killed, was under surveillance by the FBI and subject of a terror investigation.
[00:08:52.285 --> 00:09:02.333]  The FBI has arranged numerous fake terror plots, including the Washington Metro bombing plot, the New York subway plot, the plan to blow up the Sears Tower in Chicago, the plot to bomb the Portland Christmas tree lighting, and others.
[00:09:02.614 --> 00:09:05.176]  In 2014, Human Rights Watch released a report
[00:09:05.376 --> 00:09:12.900]  Stating nearly all high-profile domestic terrorism plots in the United States after 9-11 included the direct involvement of government agents and informants.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.122]  You can read about all these stories at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:16.402 --> 00:09:17.782]  Rob Due reporting for PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:09:19.189 --> 00:09:23.052]  Can the federal government take credit for saving us from a plot of its own creation?
[00:09:23.332 --> 00:09:27.956]  The FBI has foiled about 17 plots to kill Americans during the past 10 years.
[00:09:28.296 --> 00:09:30.898]  They all have a common and reprehensible thread.
[00:09:31.379 --> 00:09:36.062]  They were planned, plotted, controlled, and carried out by the federal government itself.
[00:09:36.963 --> 00:09:48.655]  In all of these 17 cases, from the Fort Dix 6, to the Lackawanna 7, to the Portland Parade bomber, the feds found young men of Muslim backgrounds, loners who were bitter in America.
[00:09:48.915 --> 00:09:53.980]  They befriended them, cajoled them, and persuaded them that they could change the world by killing Americans.
[00:09:54.521 --> 00:09:56.322]  But none of this keeps us safe.
[00:09:57.083 --> 00:10:00.966]  All of this makes us less free as any one of us can be entrapped.
[00:10:01.386 --> 00:10:08.932]  And we are fools if we praise the government for exposing a plot of its own creation and saving us from a danger that never existed.
[00:10:09.493 --> 00:10:17.639]  And one final clip that shows how the FBI likes to instigate this whole atmosphere of terror everywhere comes from the documentary, The Newburgh Sting.
[00:10:17.699 --> 00:10:20.101]  And this is Agent Fuentes.
[00:10:20.741 --> 00:10:25.605]  And he's going to tell you about how he has to keep the fear alive in all you out there.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:39.769]  If you're submitting budget proposals for a law enforcement agency, for an intelligence agency, you're not going to submit the proposal that we won the war on terror and everything's great because the first thing that's going to happen is your budget's going to be cut in half.
[00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.992]  You know, it's my opposite of Jesse Jackson's Keep Hope Alive.
[00:10:45.173 --> 00:10:46.034]  It's Keep Fear Alive.
[00:10:47.654 --> 00:10:48.274]  Just keep it alive.
[00:10:48.675 --> 00:10:54.680]  And so this was, you know, just out of the church committee hearings that the FBI was working with the KKK to cause violence.
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.523]  And we're going to get more into that later, but I want to get more into maybe what caused this fire now.
[00:10:58.623 --> 00:11:03.346]  I'm joined by Leanne McAdoo, Joe Biggs, retired Staff Sergeant on the U.S.
[00:11:03.386 --> 00:11:03.607]  Army.
[00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:10.292]  Joe, what does, there have been some developments now with this latest church burning, what seems to have caused the fire at this point?
[00:11:10.532 --> 00:11:17.076]  Well, at this point in time, we know that lightning was more than likely the cause of this, that arson was not involved.
[00:11:17.116 --> 00:11:18.536]  Wait, that doesn't fit the racist narrative.
[00:11:18.556 --> 00:11:19.337]  How can it be lightning?
[00:11:19.377 --> 00:11:21.478]  Well, it's racist because it's white lightning.
[00:11:21.738 --> 00:11:22.239]  Oh, okay.
[00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:22.659]  That's why.
[00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:24.420]  Yeah, and that just came out of CNN.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.360]  So we're gonna have to stop that.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.421]  We need to ban that as well.
[00:11:26.861 --> 00:11:33.447]  And, you know, the FBI has been working with the National Weather Service to determine whether heavy storms in the area contributed to the fire.
[00:11:33.507 --> 00:11:39.032]  So, unfortunately, it doesn't look like people are going to get their wish that it was racist white people that caused the latest fire.
[00:11:39.373 --> 00:11:46.219]  And, in fact, I showed you earlier that the people on Twitter were going crazy saying, you know, any church that burns anywhere, it must be white people.
[00:11:46.619 --> 00:11:49.362]  Yeah, I actually found a cool tweet on Twitter.
[00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:54.647]  So as you can see, a lot of people are just regurgitating what they see on the mainstream media.
[00:11:54.967 --> 00:11:56.949]  This guy says, stop the passive language.
[00:11:57.329 --> 00:11:59.571]  Fires aren't breaking out at black churches.
[00:11:59.631 --> 00:12:01.573]  Black churches are being set on fire.
[00:12:02.093 --> 00:12:05.897]  And then you got this guy down here saying, laugh out loud, arrest the racist lightning.
[00:12:06.317 --> 00:12:10.601]  You know, people just turn on the TV, and this is where the fear mongering is coming in.
[00:12:10.621 --> 00:12:11.863]  Well, that and the social media, it's just...
[00:12:12.563 --> 00:12:13.764]  We're just gonna keep throwing stuff out there.
[00:12:34.907 --> 00:12:36.449]  I guess anti-black flyers.
[00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.292]  And he was a black guy as well.
[00:12:38.332 --> 00:12:44.440]  There were these racist messages that were discovered at these predominantly black churches and it turns out it was a black suspect.
[00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:51.350]  Still no idea why he decided to go ahead and do that, but it's about provocatory and getting everyone riled up.
[00:12:51.730 --> 00:13:04.939]  Right, and that's Vincent Broughton, 44, who's black, facing charges for committed a bias-motivated crime and disorderly conduct, and black suspect arrested after racist message discovered outside predominantly black church.
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.843]  So, this is not, you know, it's, you can't blame everything on white people.
[00:13:10.427 --> 00:13:17.369]  Right, or you can't automatically jump to the easiest conclusion that, oh, if a church is set on fire, then it must be someone in the KKK.
[00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:32.672]  I mean, because here you have proof that a black suspect was actually inciting these messages, even saying that it was like, hey, black men, you're a target by the KKK, so that people would automatically think that it was put there by these white supremacist groups.
[00:13:32.992 --> 00:13:35.934]  But this has all led to what TV Land is now doing.
[00:13:35.974 --> 00:13:40.576]  They've pulled the Dukes of Hazzard episodes amid Confederate flag uproar.
[00:13:40.857 --> 00:13:42.277]  I knew that was going to happen.
[00:13:42.297 --> 00:13:43.298]  Burning down churches.
[00:13:43.738 --> 00:13:45.079]  They've been talking about it.
[00:13:45.099 --> 00:13:51.063]  They actually interviewed Cooter, I think, one of the cops from the Dukes of Hazzard, who is vimiently against
[00:13:51.983 --> 00:13:52.784]  Banning the flag.
[00:13:52.804 --> 00:13:55.665]  He says it's about heritage and it's not about slavery.
[00:13:56.226 --> 00:13:57.366]  And it was a battle flag.
[00:13:57.406 --> 00:13:59.128]  It's what they flew when they went into battle.
[00:13:59.488 --> 00:14:03.690]  And by taking that away, you're disrespecting the people who fought in the Civil War.
[00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:06.352]  And they called it a Civil War for a reason.
[00:14:06.372 --> 00:14:08.273]  It was supposed to be, you know, it was brother against brother.
[00:14:08.814 --> 00:14:10.235]  And it wasn't all about slavery.
[00:14:10.255 --> 00:14:12.996]  In fact, the slaves didn't get released until the very end of the Civil War.
[00:14:13.016 --> 00:14:15.298]  And that was like Lincoln's last maneuver.
[00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:18.200]  He didn't come out saying we're going to ban slavery in the beginning.
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:29.545]  Even though there's a lot of people against it, there's a lot of people fighting against slavery, and it would have ended, I think, anyway, had the Civil War... Well, they banned slavery in the South, but slavery still existed for two more years in the North.
[00:14:30.225 --> 00:14:31.046]  That's what people forget.
[00:14:31.206 --> 00:14:31.466]  Yeah.
[00:14:32.086 --> 00:14:33.387]  And where else has this gone?
[00:14:33.407 --> 00:14:38.389]  Now you have Daytona, the 500, they're not going to ban the Confederate flag, but they'll offer a flag exchange.
[00:14:38.789 --> 00:14:44.493]  They didn't mention if it would be an ISIS flag or an American flag that they'd give you, but they're going to offer a flag in exchange.
[00:14:44.553 --> 00:14:46.875]  I think it's funny that Dale Earnhardt Jr.
[00:14:46.975 --> 00:14:51.478]  and Jeff Gordon both expressed last week in their disapproval of the flag.
[00:14:51.538 --> 00:14:59.944]  These are guys who, you know, have made their living driving their cars in the South in that, you know, strictly Confederate flag heritage area going.
[00:14:59.984 --> 00:15:05.548]  It would be interesting if Walmart's one of the sponsors for NASCAR, so maybe they will hand out some ISIS flags instead.
[00:15:05.768 --> 00:15:07.669]  You never know, because they were making ISIS cakes.
[00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:12.172]  But let's look at some things that were built by slaves and that maybe we should tear down.
[00:15:12.192 --> 00:15:16.695]  If we're going to tear down everything that slaves have ever done and built or anything like that.
[00:15:16.975 --> 00:15:17.976]  You know, the Capitol, the U.S.
[00:15:18.016 --> 00:15:19.097]  Capitol is built by slaves.
[00:15:19.417 --> 00:15:19.877]  The White House.
[00:15:19.957 --> 00:15:21.458]  The White House is built by slaves.
[00:15:22.519 --> 00:15:23.059]  Pyramids.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.162]  Most of our clothes are made in slave factories.
[00:15:26.242 --> 00:15:31.005]  All our iPads and iPhones are built in slave factories with suicide nets around them, but that's okay.
[00:15:31.505 --> 00:15:33.365]  You know, because liberals like those.
[00:15:33.545 --> 00:15:35.086]  They like, you know, the trendy iPhones.
[00:15:35.106 --> 00:15:37.266]  Well, I'm offended by Ready for Hillary stickers.
[00:15:37.306 --> 00:15:40.047]  I think we should take those down and replace those with InfoWars stickers.
[00:15:40.187 --> 00:15:40.687]  There you go.
[00:15:40.847 --> 00:15:44.128]  Because anything that doesn't make us feel good, we should automatically ban.
[00:15:44.448 --> 00:15:45.988]  Although, Joe, you were talking about the pyramids.
[00:15:46.468 --> 00:15:51.569]  Oh, they say back in 2010, Egypt, new finds show slaves didn't build the pyramids.
[00:15:51.609 --> 00:15:52.369]  Do you believe that?
[00:15:52.429 --> 00:15:54.430]  Yeah, they got like 20,000 people to just volunteer.
[00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.010]  Like, hey man, we're going to do this for free.
[00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:57.570]  We're going to let you whip us.
[00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.091]  We're not going to have any food or water.
[00:15:59.111 --> 00:16:01.351]  And we're just going to carry these really big stones on our back.
[00:16:01.551 --> 00:16:03.312]  We like you guys.
[00:16:03.512 --> 00:16:07.775]  They're claiming because they found a tomb that had you know some people in it that they think built the pyramids.
[00:16:08.175 --> 00:16:09.977]  You know there's a hierarchy structure in a pyramid.
[00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:11.638]  The slaves are at the bottom.
[00:16:11.678 --> 00:16:11.958]  Right.
[00:16:12.258 --> 00:16:15.620]  And there's middlemen and then you have the pharaohs at the top and the royalty.
[00:16:16.821 --> 00:16:17.942]  I highly doubt it.
[00:16:18.082 --> 00:16:21.044]  How they call the Irish slaves like indentured servants.
[00:16:21.224 --> 00:16:21.684]  Exactly.
[00:16:21.704 --> 00:16:22.804]  It was just a fancy year.
[00:16:22.824 --> 00:16:25.105]  They worked really hard, but they got paid, sorta.
[00:16:25.305 --> 00:16:27.425]  You know, they got food and water, but no, they weren't slaves.
[00:16:27.585 --> 00:16:31.286]  You know, let's tear down the pyramids in South America because those were built by slaves.
[00:16:31.306 --> 00:16:45.629]  Well, and don't forget, the TPP, Obama actually rewrote a provision in it so that they could still have slave labor included in these trade deals with countries that are still actively participating in slave labor and sex trafficking.
[00:16:46.249 --> 00:16:47.450]  And it's not the United States.
[00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.671]  Although we do buy the slave labor goods, and now we're going to be importing them more.
[00:16:51.691 --> 00:16:58.515]  Well, I don't know, Walmart sort of pays slave wages, and they sort of set the precedent for the minimum wage.
[00:16:58.615 --> 00:17:10.060]  They go in, they undercut the competition, so the competition goes away, those high-paying jobs there, and then it's flooded with this low wage, and then they raise the prices back up.
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.704]  So they make more money, but they don't pay their workers.
[00:17:12.744 --> 00:17:16.270]  And the taxpayers subsidize the low wages at Walmart.
[00:17:16.691 --> 00:17:20.137]  And they probably give them property tax breaks because they go, oh, we're supplying them jobs.
[00:17:20.277 --> 00:17:21.479]  We should ban Walmart.
[00:17:21.719 --> 00:17:22.941]  We should get fancy tombs.
[00:17:23.706 --> 00:17:25.146]  Everything should be banned at this point.
[00:17:25.647 --> 00:17:28.007]  But, you know, finishing up here, we got a couple minutes left.
[00:17:28.347 --> 00:17:32.789]  The FBI is going around telling friends and family to avoid 4th of July celebrations.
[00:17:33.169 --> 00:17:39.430]  We've got an FBI official earlier this year came out and said that they have to keep the fear alive to justify their terror budget.
[00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:43.792]  And back in 2012, the New York Times posted terror plots hatched by the FBI.
[00:17:44.172 --> 00:17:46.192]  So I did a report on this this morning.
[00:17:46.672 --> 00:17:48.533]  If the FBI is out there telling us to watch out,
[00:17:49.153 --> 00:17:53.137]  And they're associated with the Klan and violence back in the 60s leading up to the 90s.
[00:17:53.397 --> 00:17:54.719]  There were still these connections going.
[00:17:55.079 --> 00:18:01.425]  You know, is the FBI going to be perpetrating terror plots and to blame it on racist white people?
[00:18:01.445 --> 00:18:06.691]  But then last week, the last week the articles that came out were Islamists not what to be worried about.
[00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:08.492]  It's more of white people in America.
[00:18:08.532 --> 00:18:09.754]  They're the number one terror threat.
[00:18:10.014 --> 00:18:10.134]  Right.
[00:18:10.154 --> 00:18:13.117]  This all plays into that leading up to this weekend.
[00:18:13.277 --> 00:18:20.062]  Right, and don't forget the FBI released their map where they're going to be set up, you know, actively watching out for terror.
[00:18:20.082 --> 00:18:22.463]  And now ISIS has also released that same map.
[00:18:22.584 --> 00:18:23.965]  This is where we're going to target.
[00:18:24.005 --> 00:18:28.448]  Well, I'm going to have my Mossberg strapped on my back riding around, so if ISIS wants to come out and play...
[00:18:29.392 --> 00:18:30.173]  Come on and take it, buddy.
[00:18:30.333 --> 00:18:30.713]  That's right.
[00:18:30.913 --> 00:18:32.334]  And hey, we're going to be back with more.
[00:18:32.434 --> 00:18:35.917]  I've got the person who started the SB-277 recalls.
[00:18:35.977 --> 00:18:40.500]  It's a real solution that you can get involved in and help change that, especially if you live in California.
[00:18:40.801 --> 00:18:42.922]  And I'm also going to have a drone here in the studio.
[00:18:42.942 --> 00:18:46.045]  We're going to talk a little bit about private versus government drones.
[00:18:46.085 --> 00:18:46.925]  So stay tuned for that.
[00:18:46.945 --> 00:18:48.046]  It's the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:18:48.106 --> 00:18:48.847]  I'm your host, Rob Dew.
[00:18:59.284 --> 00:19:05.069]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:19:05.529 --> 00:19:15.238]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:19:15.558 --> 00:19:19.319]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:24.540]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:31.141]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:33.741]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:19:34.401 --> 00:19:36.842]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:42.723]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:49.830]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
[00:19:50.191 --> 00:19:54.976]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:19:54.996 --> 00:19:56.397]  DNA Force from InfoWarsLife.
[00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:06.432]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:20:06.732 --> 00:20:21.177]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:20:21.437 --> 00:20:29.264]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:20:29.444 --> 00:20:34.869]  And when you visit Infowarslife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a 6-day liver detox.
[00:20:35.009 --> 00:20:38.392]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:20:38.572 --> 00:20:42.556]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:20:42.716 --> 00:20:46.600]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.141]  I want to make this announcement now.
[00:20:48.161 --> 00:20:49.581]  It's going up as we speak, a day early.
[00:21:08.052 --> 00:21:20.782]  To celebrate the birth of our country and give a big thanks to all the Info Warriors out there, we are now offering free shipping on every item shipped out of the InfoWarsStore.com warehouse.
[00:21:21.162 --> 00:21:24.865]  That's free shipping on all t-shirts, books, and DVDs.
[00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:31.430]  Free shipping on Molon Lave and 1776 belt buckles, which are also 25% off while supplies last.
[00:21:33.331 --> 00:21:37.934]  Free shipping on all of our InfoWarsLife.com nutraceuticals.
[00:21:38.374 --> 00:21:45.219]  If it's in the InfoWarsStore.com warehouse, it's shipping for free, all during the month of July.
[00:21:45.719 --> 00:21:58.308]  It's our way of saying thanks to the true heart and soul of this operation, who stand beside us and support us as we wage an InfoWar for liberty and freedom for all.
[00:21:58.708 --> 00:22:02.771]  InfoWarsStore.com, free shipping for the month of July.
[00:22:03.511 --> 00:22:13.093]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:22:13.553 --> 00:22:15.254]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:22:15.454 --> 00:22:16.014]  Think about it.
[00:22:16.214 --> 00:22:21.996]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:22:22.256 --> 00:22:27.817]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:22:28.217 --> 00:22:39.961]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:43.001]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:22:43.201 --> 00:22:45.662]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:22:45.982 --> 00:22:50.444]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:22:50.884 --> 00:22:51.464]  Think about it.
[00:22:51.664 --> 00:23:02.848]  This is Darren McBreen and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on in your mind.
[00:23:17.907 --> 00:23:20.029]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:23:20.049 --> 00:23:38.681]  This is our third segment and we're going to go deep into what is now being called the one of the I think the biggest vaccine controversy in the nation at this time and that is the vaccine bill SB 277 which is mandating that every parent get their child vaccinated in the state of California.
[00:23:38.721 --> 00:23:43.985]  The governor just signed it and I want to go over something that the governor said a few years ago.
[00:23:44.365 --> 00:23:45.386]  This is back in September 6, 2011.
[00:23:48.522 --> 00:23:50.803]  I am returning the Senate Bill 105 without my signature.
[00:23:51.164 --> 00:23:58.428]  The measure would impose criminal penalties on a child under the age of 18 if his parents and the child of skis or snowboards did this without a helmet.
[00:23:58.568 --> 00:24:06.934]  While I appreciate the value of wearing a ski helmet, I am concerned about the continuing and seemingly inexorable transfer of authority from parent to the state.
[00:24:07.654 --> 00:24:09.575]  Not every human problem deserves a law.
[00:24:09.715 --> 00:24:13.737]  I believe parents have the ability and responsibility to make good choices for their children.
[00:24:14.258 --> 00:24:14.518]  Okay?
[00:24:15.298 --> 00:24:18.540]  Now, that is on for skiing, which you could go look up the stats.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.221]  People die from skiing.
[00:24:20.801 --> 00:24:24.003]  People get maimed really bad when they don't wear helmets.
[00:24:24.823 --> 00:24:25.884]  It's a pretty smart thing to do.
[00:24:25.904 --> 00:24:28.285]  You could also look up the stats on bicycles.
[00:24:28.785 --> 00:24:31.146]  About six children a year die from bicycles.
[00:24:31.727 --> 00:24:35.869]  Now, this whole SB-277 started with this crazy measles outbreak.
[00:24:36.684 --> 00:24:38.006]  That happened in Disneyland.
[00:24:38.066 --> 00:24:42.434]  That was definitely transferred by workers who had already been vaccinated.
[00:24:43.786 --> 00:24:53.351]  And it came from a country that has a 98% vaccination rate, and they consider them to be measles-free in that area.
[00:24:53.411 --> 00:24:56.452]  I think it was the Philippines where it originated from.
[00:24:56.973 --> 00:24:59.494]  Now let's look at the money that was poured in for SB 277.
[00:25:00.474 --> 00:25:04.276]  $2 million donated to lawmakers in 2013-2014.
[00:25:04.957 --> 00:25:09.139]  Opponents of the SB 277 link supporters to pharmaceutical donations.
[00:25:09.159 --> 00:25:11.520]  And you can look at the donations here.
[00:25:12.947 --> 00:25:16.791]  Over $2,000,000 Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly.
[00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:19.553]  Those are your main vaccine makers.
[00:25:19.693 --> 00:25:27.700]  Merck is also in there, Bristol-Myers, Pfizer, and the top center there, Richard Pan, $95,000 in donations.
[00:25:28.301 --> 00:25:29.282]  How do you think he's going to vote?
[00:25:29.662 --> 00:25:30.483]  Think he's going to vote yes?
[00:25:31.083 --> 00:25:32.324]  Yeah, of course he's going to vote yes.
[00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:34.727]  These people are paid off, especially in California.
[00:25:35.347 --> 00:25:39.530]  Because they need so much money to live because that state has turned into a giant welfare state.
[00:25:40.091 --> 00:25:49.238]  Meanwhile, while the governor, Jerry Brown, is signing this law, he's got an estimated $59 billion to fix the now crumbling roads.
[00:25:50.059 --> 00:25:52.681]  So I don't know how he's going to fix these roads.
[00:25:52.701 --> 00:26:01.048]  He should be worried about the damn roads, not making sure kids are vaccinated against their parents' consent, which seems to be what he is concerned about.
[00:26:01.388 --> 00:26:07.230]  Now, all this vaccine media uproar has caused Jim Carrey to actually speak out on Twitter.
[00:26:07.611 --> 00:26:11.092]  But, of course, he was attacked, and he's not even against vaccination.
[00:26:11.152 --> 00:26:13.213]  He's just saying, why do we have toxins in vaccines?
[00:26:13.233 --> 00:26:14.153]  And I'll get to that in a second.
[00:26:14.173 --> 00:26:17.275]  But the hit dogs came out on him.
[00:26:17.795 --> 00:26:19.175]  You look at Salon.com.
[00:26:19.295 --> 00:26:22.857]  Jim Carrey leads California's paranoid anti-vax freakout.
[00:26:23.257 --> 00:26:25.258]  This corporate fascist must be stopped.
[00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.772]  Here we are in Salon Carried Away.
[00:26:31.793 --> 00:26:33.534]  Just everybody's attacking Jim Carrey.
[00:26:33.574 --> 00:26:34.534]  Here's the Daily Beast.
[00:26:34.894 --> 00:26:36.875]  Jim Carrey's descent into madness.
[00:26:37.856 --> 00:26:42.558]  Okay, here's a shot of him in a beard looking crazy because he asked a few simple questions.
[00:26:42.578 --> 00:26:44.579]  Let's look at some of his tweets.
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.042]  He even says, I'm pro-vaccine, anti-neurotoxin.
[00:26:52.288 --> 00:26:56.811]  California governor says yes to poisoning more children with mercury and aluminum in mandatory vaccines.
[00:26:56.831 --> 00:26:58.413]  This corporate fascist must be stopped.
[00:27:00.274 --> 00:27:05.679]  They say mercury in fish is dangerous, but forcing all our children to be injected with mercury and thimerosal is no risk.
[00:27:05.899 --> 00:27:06.419]  Makes sense?
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.461]  I am not anti-vaccine.
[00:27:08.501 --> 00:27:10.263]  I'm anti-thimerosal, anti-mercury.
[00:27:12.704 --> 00:27:23.312]  Okay, these are just normal tweets from a guy who doesn't think mercury should be injected into small babies.
[00:27:23.812 --> 00:27:24.453]  Or aluminum.
[00:27:24.833 --> 00:27:26.194]  Or the other toxins that are in there.
[00:27:26.214 --> 00:27:26.715]  There's a lot more.
[00:27:26.735 --> 00:27:29.256]  You should actually read the damn insert to find out.
[00:27:30.077 --> 00:27:32.119]  And now I want you to watch this video testimonial.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.282]  This is from a lady named Landy Cryer.
[00:27:35.163 --> 00:27:38.787]  And she had, she vaccinated her first two children and they had adverse reactions.
[00:27:38.827 --> 00:27:43.733]  They had asthma, anaphylactic shock, which means you stop breathing, and shingles in the eyes.
[00:27:43.753 --> 00:27:46.396]  So she decided not to vaccinate her third child.
[00:27:46.676 --> 00:27:48.817]  Which is her choice to do as a parent.
[00:27:48.877 --> 00:27:49.737]  Informed consent.
[00:27:50.037 --> 00:27:51.978]  This is what the Governor of California is taking away.
[00:27:52.038 --> 00:27:53.119]  And this is going to be a springboard.
[00:27:53.339 --> 00:27:55.940]  And it's going to come to every state out there in the United States.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.741]  They're going to force this vaccination program on you.
[00:27:59.021 --> 00:28:00.622]  And then they're going to bring in more vaccines.
[00:28:00.642 --> 00:28:04.823]  They're going to say, oh, you need a vaccine against tether or psoriasis.
[00:28:04.943 --> 00:28:05.424]  Whatever.
[00:28:05.504 --> 00:28:08.145]  They're going to come up with something that you need a vaccine for.
[00:28:08.545 --> 00:28:09.885]  Oh, you don't like what the government says?
[00:28:09.905 --> 00:28:10.846]  We got a vaccine for that.
[00:28:11.326 --> 00:28:13.107]  So watch what this mother says.
[00:28:13.587 --> 00:28:15.448]  And this is what they're going to take away from you out there.
[00:28:15.748 --> 00:28:16.148]  Be warned.
[00:28:17.762 --> 00:28:18.623]  Hi, I'm Landy.
[00:28:18.863 --> 00:28:25.429]  I have three children who reacted to vaccines, and I'd like to share why I'm opposed to mandatory vaccination.
[00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:30.654]  My oldest, my first two children were both fully vaccinated.
[00:28:31.295 --> 00:28:39.362]  My boy wheezed after his two-month shots, and I asked the pediatrician, could the vaccines make him wheeze?
[00:28:39.802 --> 00:28:42.385]  And, you know, she kind of looked at me like I had eight heads.
[00:28:42.525 --> 00:28:42.865]  She just
[00:28:43.686 --> 00:28:44.387]  Thank you.
[00:29:02.682 --> 00:29:06.184]  My older two children that they immediately got healthier.
[00:29:06.744 --> 00:29:15.348]  I took them to a holistic practitioner and we got them off all the antibiotics and the vaccines and their health improved immensely.
[00:29:15.989 --> 00:29:28.695]  So with my third child I was not vaccinating because I had concerns about the asthma and I really truly felt that and I had done some research and saw that asthma was actually listed as a adverse side effect of vaccines.
[00:29:29.355 --> 00:29:33.976]  So I was concerned about that, so I didn't vaccinate the younger, my third child.
[00:29:34.617 --> 00:29:36.397]  But he had a bad accident.
[00:29:36.457 --> 00:29:52.122]  He cut his cheek on a metal scooter, and so when I took him to the ER, he had to get a lot of stitches, and they convinced me that he needed to take, because of tetanus, fear of tetanus, because he was cut by metal, he needed to have the DTAP shot, which was only given
[00:29:52.922 --> 00:29:56.545]  In DTAP, I couldn't get it separate, like I couldn't just get a tetanus shot.
[00:29:57.346 --> 00:30:11.957]  So I went ahead and caved and they gave him the shot and within seven days he had a really large lump on his arm at the injection site and it was very hot and he said his arm hurt, he couldn't raise his arm.
[00:30:12.517 --> 00:30:20.324]  So I called the pediatrician and she just told me that he was having a localized reaction to the vaccine and to put ice on it and watch him.
[00:30:21.144 --> 00:30:29.707]  And within 8 to 10 hours of that, he started crying and he had hives over his entire body, was covered in hives.
[00:30:30.167 --> 00:30:35.649]  He started saying he couldn't breathe and it was very scary, so we took him to the emergency room.
[00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:38.310]  And by the time we got there, they said his throat was closing.
[00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:43.231]  And they gave him a shot of steroids and did a bunch of things to open up his airway.
[00:30:44.011 --> 00:30:48.413]  And he continued to have to be on oral and topical
[00:30:49.582 --> 00:30:49.803]  Thank you!
[00:31:03.035 --> 00:31:09.461]  I started researching more about vaccines and found out all the adverse side effects that they can have.
[00:31:10.222 --> 00:31:17.089]  And I realized that a lot of these problems my children had had were actually a result of the vaccines.
[00:31:17.529 --> 00:31:20.853]  And my daughter, when she was a teenager, developed shingles in her eye.
[00:31:21.734 --> 00:31:24.236]  And the eye doctor asked us, has she had the chicken pox?
[00:31:24.536 --> 00:31:26.719]  And I said, no, you know, but she had the vaccine.
[00:31:27.299 --> 00:31:38.102]  So basically by her getting the vaccine for the chickenpox, it caused her to get shingles in her eye and she's had two or three more episodes of that as a result of having that vaccine as well.
[00:31:39.415 --> 00:31:56.825]  And I'm very opposed to mandatory vaccination because I am concerned that with my youngest, he had the anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine, so I would probably be able to get a medical exemption for that one vaccine, but he would not qualify for an exemption on the other vaccines, and there's so many now.
[00:31:57.685 --> 00:32:03.411]  And my concern is that there's the same ingredients, or some of the same ingredients, which could have caused his reaction.
[00:32:04.152 --> 00:32:06.895]  And I don't want to play Russian Roulette with him again.
[00:32:07.216 --> 00:32:08.357]  And I don't want to put him through that.
[00:32:08.377 --> 00:32:11.160]  It was very traumatic and very scary for everyone involved.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.726]  So while I was vaccinating my older two children, I noticed that their immune systems were weaker.
[00:32:16.906 --> 00:32:17.667]  They were getting sick.
[00:32:18.448 --> 00:32:18.788]  A lot.
[00:32:18.828 --> 00:32:20.529]  They were sick all the time with different things.
[00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:23.952]  I didn't vaccinate my third child and he was never sick.
[00:32:23.992 --> 00:32:25.393]  He never had ear infections.
[00:32:25.893 --> 00:32:40.483]  So I kind of realized that the immune system left untouched was a lot stronger and the symptoms and things when he would get a cold were a lot less severe than when the older two, which I had on the vaccine schedule, they tended to
[00:32:41.423 --> 00:32:42.544]  Be sick more frequently.
[00:32:43.745 --> 00:32:54.711]  So with all of them, I kind of figured out that just building the immune system is the way to beat illness and not necessarily does it have to come from a vaccine.
[00:32:55.332 --> 00:33:03.177]  And I feel I'm not too concerned about my kids getting whooping cough or the measles because I know that if I keep their immune system strong,
[00:33:03.817 --> 00:33:23.616]  That they'll be able to overcome that and I won't have to be concerned about major side effects because they have a strong immune system and with enough vitamin A and enough vitamin C and you know taking them to a holistic doctor I feel like that that they would be able to recover and be stronger and be granted the the life the gift of lifelong immunity from if they did get those diseases.
[00:33:33.226 --> 00:33:41.394]  About a year and a half ago, Anthony Gucciardi just said, man, I just did a Dr. Gribbs liver cleanse, the one he recommends, and he's developing this proprietary stuff he's testing on himself right now.
[00:33:41.494 --> 00:33:42.235]  You really ought to do it.
[00:33:42.335 --> 00:33:44.217]  The results are dramatic after six days.
[00:33:44.437 --> 00:33:46.178]  I'm like, no way, no way I'm doing it.
[00:33:46.299 --> 00:33:49.462]  I don't believe that there's giant black or green balls in my gallbladder.
[00:33:49.482 --> 00:33:50.523]  This is how ignorant I am.
[00:33:50.603 --> 00:33:51.764]  And he's like, look at it online.
[00:33:51.824 --> 00:33:52.925]  I'm not looking at it online.
[00:33:52.985 --> 00:33:53.986]  Stuff like that grosses me out.
[00:33:54.006 --> 00:33:54.626]  I don't want to go there.
[00:33:54.646 --> 00:33:57.269]  Well, finally, about six months ago, they convinced me to do it.
[00:33:57.389 --> 00:34:01.553]  I personally think everybody should go through a liver cleansing if you haven't done one.
[00:34:01.593 --> 00:34:02.894]  Results speak for themselves.
[00:34:02.954 --> 00:34:10.380]  I mean, hundreds of thousands of people have done this, and it dates back even a thousand years, drinking oils to cleanse and purge the liver.
[00:34:10.861 --> 00:34:15.705]  Actually, the Greeks over in India with Ayurvedic medicine have done it the same way.
[00:34:15.765 --> 00:34:21.490]  But how it works is, what you should do, and this is what our proprietary research led us to do back
[00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:21.650]  Yeah.
[00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:41.502]  The high-quality proprietary liver trex developed by Dr. Gribb that we've private-labeled through him.
[00:34:41.642 --> 00:34:45.644]  And it's extremely strong, extremely concentrated, extremely high-powered.
[00:34:45.704 --> 00:34:51.568]  You combine that with the Oxy Powder, oxygen-based intestinal cleanser, dietary supplement, clinically tested.
[00:34:51.628 --> 00:34:54.630]  We have them discounted at the lowest price you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:56.311]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:56.551 --> 00:34:59.353]  Obviously, folks should probably talk to their healthcare provider before they do this.
[00:34:59.493 --> 00:35:04.917]  This is one of the single biggest results, if not the biggest, I've ever seen in my life, literally in a six-day period.
[00:35:04.997 --> 00:35:06.498]  This is something anybody can do.
[00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:09.823]  Obviously the literature is well known on what liver cleanses do.
[00:35:09.903 --> 00:35:11.826]  This is the best one out there from our research.
[00:35:11.887 --> 00:35:13.509]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:35:16.897 --> 00:35:18.118]  Another major health threat.
[00:35:18.158 --> 00:35:23.040]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.761]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:35:25.801 --> 00:35:32.584]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:35:32.844 --> 00:35:35.705]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:35:35.845 --> 00:35:38.787]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:35:38.867 --> 00:35:40.788]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:35:40.808 --> 00:35:43.649]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:35:43.729 --> 00:35:49.252]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:35:49.452 --> 00:35:52.954]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:35:52.974 --> 00:35:55.976]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:35:56.056 --> 00:36:03.160]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.402]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[00:36:06.502 --> 00:36:07.543]  I want to make this announcement now.
[00:36:07.563 --> 00:36:08.664]  It's going up as we speak, a day early.
[00:36:23.823 --> 00:36:36.534]  To celebrate the birth of our country and give a big thanks to all the Info Warriors out there, we are now offering free shipping on every item shipped out of the InfoWarsStore.com warehouse.

[00:37:14.482 --> 00:37:18.525]  InfoWarsStore.com, free shipping for the month of July.
[00:37:19.345 --> 00:37:21.826]  Fool me once, shame on you.
[00:37:22.686 --> 00:37:25.147]  Fool me twice, shame on me.
[00:37:26.348 --> 00:37:29.349]  Vote for Jeb, or you're just f***ing stupid.
[00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:34.711]  Fool me, can't get fooled again.
[00:37:40.914 --> 00:37:52.280]  NBC's severing all its business ties with Trump in the last hour, Brooke, and this is because there have been calls for days from Hispanic leaders saying, how can you be in business with this man if he is calling Mexican immigrants rapists and killers?
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:59.084]  Billionaire and presidential candidate Donald Trump has been lambasted by NBC and Univision for these comments.
[00:37:59.304 --> 00:38:03.226]  The US has become a dumping ground
[00:38:05.011 --> 00:38:06.713]  For everybody else's problems.
[00:38:07.614 --> 00:38:11.458]  When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.
[00:38:12.059 --> 00:38:13.100]  They're not sending you.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.581]  They're not sending you.
[00:38:15.542 --> 00:38:21.208]  They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:28.686]  They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.
[00:38:29.046 --> 00:38:32.709]  But I speak to border guards, and they tell us what we're getting.
[00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.591]  And it only makes common sense.
[00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:42.338]  It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably, probably from the Middle East.
[00:38:43.339 --> 00:38:46.962]  But we don't know, because we have no protection, and we have no competence.
[00:38:47.422 --> 00:38:48.563]  We don't know what's happening.
[00:38:49.386 --> 00:38:50.307]  And it's gotta stop.
[00:38:50.807 --> 00:38:52.048]  And it's gotta stop fast.
[00:38:54.430 --> 00:39:01.015]  Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
[00:39:02.517 --> 00:39:03.437]  They've become rich.
[00:39:05.219 --> 00:39:06.680]  I'm in competition with them.
[00:39:07.761 --> 00:39:09.783]  They just built a hotel in Syria.
[00:39:09.803 --> 00:39:10.643]  Can you believe this?
[00:39:11.304 --> 00:39:12.185]  They built a hotel.
[00:39:13.407 --> 00:39:15.972]  When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
[00:39:16.132 --> 00:39:17.194]  They don't have to pay interest.
[00:39:17.474 --> 00:39:22.844]  Because they took the oil that when we left Iraq, I said we should have taken.
[00:39:23.705 --> 00:39:25.969]  So now ISIS has the oil.
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:37.791]  Donald Trump is now second in the New Hampshire and Iowa polls among likely caucus-goers, and is standing by his misrepresented comments on immigration, rape, and crime.
[00:39:37.891 --> 00:39:44.518]  And now, with my statements on immigration, which happen to be correct, they are going to take a different stance, and that's okay.
[00:39:44.578 --> 00:39:48.202]  Misrepresented comments, which are unfortunately true.
[00:39:48.522 --> 00:39:52.863]  Thomas didn't find the man he was looking for, but something far worse.
[00:39:53.324 --> 00:39:59.445]  Thomas says he found 47-year-old Martin Vazquez in the act of raping a 6-year-old girl.
[00:39:59.886 --> 00:40:06.027]  Officers say neighbors told them that several of the neighborhood children play in Vazquez's backyard.
[00:40:06.047 --> 00:40:10.929]  A spokeswoman for the Davidson County Sheriff's Office said, you said it was in this country illegally.
[00:40:11.229 --> 00:40:15.994]  Gurau Aguilar faces three counts of aggravated sexual battery of a person under the age of 13.
[00:40:16.754 --> 00:40:20.238]  Jacobo Gurau faces one count of rape of a person under the age of 13.
[00:40:20.358 --> 00:40:27.484]  Police believe 19-year-old Sergio Perez, an illegal immigrant, attacked the woman in her home Sunday.
[00:40:27.504 --> 00:40:32.950]  418 children were raped by illegals in the state of North Carolina in the month of August 2014 alone.
[00:40:34.571 --> 00:40:40.076]  Another drug investigation led to a shootout that left a deputy wounded and a police informant dead.
[00:40:40.196 --> 00:40:43.139]  It all started with this big rig filled with marijuana.
[00:40:43.159 --> 00:40:44.700]  Well, you mentioned the 18-wheeler.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:51.966]  We had 300 pounds of marijuana or more, and obviously a homicide, all in front of an entrance to a quiet neighborhood.
[00:40:52.086 --> 00:40:55.489]  The Pinal County Sheriff asking President Obama to send troops.
[00:40:55.889 --> 00:41:02.035]  Sheriff Paul Babu says Mexican drug cartels now control parts of Arizona, all the way up to Metro Phoenix.
[00:41:02.295 --> 00:41:10.184]  This latest move details that not only does NBC reinstate known liars like Brian Williams, they are also in the big business of controlling the narrative.
[00:41:21.317 --> 00:41:23.678]  Whether or not American lives are in grave danger.
[00:41:23.918 --> 00:41:31.623]  And it just goes to show how far Americans will be diverted from a hardcore reality in the name of supposed political correctness.
[00:41:31.983 --> 00:41:49.072]  An insouciant generation will inherit a country on track to go down harder than Greece, where our immigration policies allow thousands of foreign felons to be released onto the streets of America, while an epidemic of child rape goes largely ignored in their own backyards.
[00:41:49.497 --> 00:41:50.317]  You want answers?
[00:41:50.617 --> 00:41:51.518]  I think I'm entitled.
[00:41:51.538 --> 00:41:52.518]  You want answers!
[00:41:52.738 --> 00:41:53.659]  I want the truth!
[00:41:53.959 --> 00:41:55.539]  You can't handle the truth!
[00:41:55.899 --> 00:41:59.701]  You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties.
[00:42:00.081 --> 00:42:01.821]  You want me on that wall.
[00:42:02.202 --> 00:42:03.982]  You need me on that wall.
[00:42:04.622 --> 00:42:08.584]  We use words like honor, code, loyalty.
[00:42:09.164 --> 00:42:12.665]  We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something.
[00:42:12.945 --> 00:42:14.446]  You use them as a punchline.
[00:42:14.866 --> 00:42:16.927]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:42:24.656 --> 00:42:28.379]  And that was John Bowden's report on the vilification of Donald Trump.
[00:42:28.439 --> 00:42:33.364]  And that's what's in store for you out there if you don't say the right thing, depending on who's in charge.
[00:42:33.784 --> 00:42:36.727]  Now I want to turn your attention to this little guy here.
[00:42:36.747 --> 00:42:44.634]  This is a drone I recently took to North Carolina on a family vacation with all the shark attacks that were going on in North Carolina.
[00:42:44.754 --> 00:42:50.099]  Alex mandated that I bring that out there, learn how to fly it, and shoot some footage of the ocean.
[00:42:50.139 --> 00:42:50.940]  And we're going to have a report
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:56.125]  Coming up on that, but I wanted to talk about responsible and irresponsible uses of drones real quick.
[00:42:56.145 --> 00:42:57.487]  I want to fly through some articles.
[00:42:58.258 --> 00:43:05.782]  Back in 2012, we held the first annual drone mob, Texas Protest Spy Drones, and you could go on that.
[00:43:05.842 --> 00:43:07.043]  I would say take a look at that footage.
[00:43:07.063 --> 00:43:11.465]  We have a pretty amazing array of drones that we flew, and they were kind of like kiddie drones.
[00:43:11.505 --> 00:43:14.107]  I wouldn't say they were anything big and scary.
[00:43:14.347 --> 00:43:16.728]  Some guy brought out some pretty cool model airplanes as well.
[00:43:16.748 --> 00:43:18.429]  We got some interesting videos there.
[00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:20.710]  Now here's an irresponsible use.
[00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.992]  Meth drone crashes near US-Mexico border.
[00:43:24.052 --> 00:43:25.853]  This was back in January of 2015.
[00:43:28.034 --> 00:43:29.775]  Um, so there you go.
[00:43:29.815 --> 00:43:31.015]  That's an irresponsible use.
[00:43:31.035 --> 00:43:31.556]  Here's another one.
[00:43:31.936 --> 00:43:34.297]  Drone crash at White House reveals security risks.
[00:43:34.357 --> 00:43:42.680]  So this is the guy is actually a government worker who was drunk, who flew his drone into near the White House and crashed on the White House lawn.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.461]  Now here, I think is a little more of a responsible use.
[00:43:45.581 --> 00:43:48.142]  Seal Beach uses drone to track young great white sharks.
[00:43:48.542 --> 00:43:57.267]  And it talks about how the lifeguards out there are flying, looks like the same type of drone, over the beaches out there to monitor what the sharks are doing.
[00:43:57.287 --> 00:44:01.969]  And they do see a lot of sharks, especially in the Pacific Ocean, you have a lot of great white activity.
[00:44:02.749 --> 00:44:04.050]  Here's another irresponsible use.
[00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:09.153]  Tourists sparked security scare in Milan after crashing a remote-controlled drone into famous cathedral.
[00:44:09.213 --> 00:44:13.395]  So this is the Milan Cathedral that was just, took years, hundreds of years to build this thing.
[00:44:13.915 --> 00:44:17.337]  And so, of course, some jerk and a drone crashes into it.
[00:44:19.158 --> 00:44:19.879]  Here's another one from the BBC.
[00:44:19.899 --> 00:44:28.247]  Well, they went to small claims court, the judge sided with the drone flyer, and so now he's trying to collect on the money he spent on his homemade drone.
[00:44:42.361 --> 00:44:46.562]  See, a responsible use, irresponsible person on the ground shooting the drone out of the sky.
[00:44:46.602 --> 00:44:47.283]  Now here's another one.
[00:44:47.763 --> 00:44:51.204]  Aviation expert warns of disasters after drones near miss with an Airbus.
[00:44:51.224 --> 00:44:52.485]  This just happened a couple days ago.
[00:44:52.865 --> 00:44:58.447]  A drone narrowly missed a commercial aircraft coming into land at Heathrow and a second such incident in less than a year.
[00:44:58.947 --> 00:45:02.268]  So there are responsible and irresponsible uses of drones.
[00:45:02.728 --> 00:45:10.113]  I took the drone out to fly over the waters of the Outer Banks in North Carolina to look at the sea life, and I found some amazing stuff.
[00:45:10.153 --> 00:45:14.135]  Some stingray footage, some dolphin footage, and we're going to go to that report right now.
[00:45:15.413 --> 00:45:18.675]  Recently, I took a family vacation to the Outer Banks of North Carolina.
[00:45:19.276 --> 00:45:25.519]  It was my in-laws 50th anniversary celebration, and they treated their family to an amazing week of fun in the sun.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:32.344]  But due to the recent hysteria by the mainstream media of shark attacks in that area, Alex Jones sent me armed with a drone.
[00:45:32.584 --> 00:45:36.106]  We're gonna take the drone out for a spin, see if any of this works.
[00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:41.830]  Okay.
[00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:53.533]  The DJI Phantom 2 Plus Vision, to be exact.
[00:45:54.254 --> 00:46:00.780]  It was fairly easy to fly, and when I flew it over the ocean, I was amazed at how much sea life was swimming around us near the shore.
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:02.842]  Here you can see large schools of fish.
[00:46:03.542 --> 00:46:07.326]  I saw numerous cattle rays, including this amazing footage of a mating dance.
[00:46:07.947 --> 00:46:11.310]  And on one particular day, there were dozens of dolphins swimming near the coast.
[00:46:15.632 --> 00:46:20.393]  It was purely magical watching the video of the adult and juvenile dolphins swimming so close to shore.
[00:46:30.896 --> 00:46:34.517]  I even found what I thought were Infowarriors, but I guess they didn't like the drone.
[00:46:34.997 --> 00:46:37.098]  But most people were okay with it flying around.
[00:46:39.002 --> 00:46:41.784]  But I ask myself, are we being conditioned to their presence?
[00:46:42.464 --> 00:46:45.547]  In San Diego, the lifeguards are flying them offshore looking for sharks.
[00:46:45.927 --> 00:46:48.389]  In fact, a man was bitten by a shark south of our location.
[00:46:48.889 --> 00:46:51.671]  And a young boy caught a juvenile shark in the surf right next to us.
[00:46:52.742 --> 00:46:58.325]  But you are more likely to be killed by a jellyfish, deer, or even a vending machine than you are a shark.
[00:46:58.985 --> 00:47:02.287]  There are a lot of positive uses for drones, especially in video production.
[00:47:02.987 --> 00:47:06.669]  A shot like this would have cost thousands of dollars in men and equipment.
[00:47:07.209 --> 00:47:14.033]  But the government, which has been caught using drones to spy on us and even kill American citizens, is obviously not what this country was founded on.
[00:47:14.913 --> 00:47:24.103]  So if you are a private drone operator, use your drone in a positive fashion and don't give the bureaucrats an excuse to take this amazing tool out of our hands like they've tried to do with guns.
[00:47:25.264 --> 00:47:28.688]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:47:30.106 --> 00:47:33.147]  And so that was the inaugural voyage of the InfoWars drone.
[00:47:33.167 --> 00:47:40.671]  We're going to be using this definitely in the future for all kinds of news gathering purposes, responsible purposes, not irresponsible purposes.
[00:47:40.731 --> 00:47:46.474]  Now, this might be a little irresponsible, but I'm going to attempt to fly the drone as we go out to break in the studio.
[00:47:47.254 --> 00:47:48.495]  So we'll be back.
[00:47:48.515 --> 00:47:58.239]  We're going to have the person who organized the SB-277 recall website to kind of get people activated into doing something worthwhile.
[00:47:58.659 --> 00:47:59.260]  And here we go.
[00:48:24.332 --> 00:48:30.137]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:30.597 --> 00:48:40.286]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:40.626 --> 00:48:44.387]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:44.927 --> 00:48:49.609]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:49.989 --> 00:48:56.211]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:56.531 --> 00:48:58.811]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:59.471 --> 00:49:01.912]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:49:02.292 --> 00:49:07.794]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:49:08.234 --> 00:49:14.898]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
[00:49:15.258 --> 00:49:20.161]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:49:20.221 --> 00:49:21.461]  DNA Force from InfoWarsLife.
[00:49:26.198 --> 00:49:27.419]  Another major health threat.
[00:49:27.459 --> 00:49:32.341]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:49:32.421 --> 00:49:35.062]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:49:35.102 --> 00:49:41.864]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:45.006]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:49:45.146 --> 00:49:48.067]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:49:48.087 --> 00:49:50.088]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:49:50.108 --> 00:49:52.949]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:49:53.029 --> 00:49:58.553]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:49:58.753 --> 00:50:02.236]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:50:02.256 --> 00:50:05.279]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:50:05.299 --> 00:50:12.464]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:50:12.684 --> 00:50:15.747]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:50:22.312 --> 00:50:24.793]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:50:31.857 --> 00:50:35.599]  Welcome back to our final segment on InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:50:35.619 --> 00:50:38.160]  This is our July 1st, 2015 segment.
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:39.461]  I'm your host, Rob Dew.
[00:50:39.521 --> 00:50:44.703]  Joining me now on the phone is the organizer for SB277 Recalls.
[00:50:45.124 --> 00:50:46.044]  It is Lauren Stephens.
[00:50:46.064 --> 00:50:47.025]  Lauren, how are you doing today?
[00:50:47.985 --> 00:50:48.845]  Hey, I'm doing great.
[00:50:48.905 --> 00:50:49.586]  Thanks for having me.
[00:50:50.051 --> 00:50:54.254]  So tell me, what was the impetus for starting SB 277 recalls?
[00:50:54.454 --> 00:50:55.474]  What got you involved in this?
[00:50:55.514 --> 00:50:57.636]  Just give everybody out there the whole pitch.
[00:50:58.956 --> 00:50:59.917]  Thanks.
[00:51:00.457 --> 00:51:14.666]  Well, this started over the Senate vote in favor of SB 277, which I'm not sure if everybody realizes this, but this was passed not just by Democrats, but also by a few Republicans.
[00:51:15.927 --> 00:51:20.708]  And one of the supporters of one of those Republican senators contacted me about doing the recall.
[00:51:21.188 --> 00:51:28.029]  And once I got on board with that, then other people started contacting me to do recalls in their district as well.
[00:51:28.189 --> 00:51:35.351]  So, you know, we've been pretty busy the past, what, six weeks, I guess it is, trying to get some of these recalls initiated.
[00:51:35.971 --> 00:51:38.551]  And, you know, it takes a while.
[00:51:38.611 --> 00:51:43.432]  It takes about a month or so to actually get to the certification process through the state.
[00:51:44.969 --> 00:51:48.571]  And what will happen when you recall a senator?
[00:51:49.112 --> 00:51:54.215]  How does that process work and how long would it take from the initiation of it to actually get them removed from office?
[00:51:55.255 --> 00:52:03.621]  Well, here's how it works in the state of California, which, you know, I was involved in some recalls in Wisconsin, and California actually has a much better and more efficient system, believe it or not.
[00:52:04.521 --> 00:52:05.702]  What happens here is that
[00:52:06.266 --> 00:52:09.929]  Initially, you'll do an intent to recall notice.
[00:52:10.009 --> 00:52:16.014]  So we have to get 40 to 60 signatures from people in whatever district.
[00:52:16.634 --> 00:52:23.299]  We serve that the intent to recall on the lawmaker, senator or assembly person.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.802]  They have seven days to come up with a response.
[00:52:27.382 --> 00:52:31.926]  Once that happens, we have to file all this stuff in the newspaper.
[00:52:31.986 --> 00:52:34.728]  We have to publish it in the newspaper, which is very expensive.
[00:52:34.788 --> 00:52:36.029]  It's like a quarter page.
[00:52:36.485 --> 00:52:38.506]  Display ads, so they're not cheap.
[00:52:40.067 --> 00:52:50.111]  Once that happens, and we have to draft a recall petition, and then the state has, I'm not sure the timeline, but the state has to certify that.
[00:52:50.731 --> 00:53:00.215]  Once that is certified, then we get the green light to start, and from there we get, I think it's 160 days to get the amount of signatures.
[00:53:00.516 --> 00:53:05.738]  And the number of signatures is all listed on our website, so people can kind of get an idea.
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:07.002]  Okay.
[00:53:15.262 --> 00:53:27.772]  Right, and so right now I guess you're looking for volunteers and people to get on with this effort, also conduct different social media campaigns to get people, I guess, bring awareness to this, that this could actually happen, that we don't need medical tyranny forced down our throats.
[00:53:28.212 --> 00:53:37.840]  Especially when Jerry Brown's the same governor that vetoed a bill about mandatory helmets back in 2011, saying it's the parents' responsibility.
[00:53:38.655 --> 00:53:55.305]  Yeah, well, you know, it's not just that, but we had AB 2109 a couple of years ago where Jerry Brown made an executive order that said that parents still could keep their parental and religious rights and opt out through that.
[00:53:55.585 --> 00:54:00.908]  But so, honest to God, I don't know anybody who really thought he was going to sign SB 277.
[00:54:01.149 --> 00:54:02.029]  I think it's bizarre.
[00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:03.230]  I wasn't expecting it.
[00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:04.971]  I mean, we all knew there was a chance.
[00:54:05.962 --> 00:54:07.262]  But he didn't waste any time.
[00:54:07.322 --> 00:54:15.905]  I mean, he did this within 24 hours of the bill passing the Senate, and he had 12 days.
[00:54:16.185 --> 00:54:19.586]  So I think he was sending us a clear message by doing it so quickly.
[00:54:19.606 --> 00:54:23.887]  It's pretty astonishing.
[00:54:23.967 --> 00:54:25.607]  Democrats are supposed to be pro-choice.
[00:54:25.707 --> 00:54:27.848]  They're supposed to be pro-freedom.
[00:54:30.769 --> 00:54:33.550]  It's mostly Democrats behind this, but again, there are some Republicans.
[00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:34.930]  I don't want to pick on Democrats here.
[00:54:36.025 --> 00:54:43.833]  But this is not what Democrats have expected from their party, and a lot of them have left the Democrat Party over this.
[00:54:44.573 --> 00:54:45.815]  And I don't think they're going to come back.
[00:54:46.243 --> 00:54:56.867]  Well, and we've had in Texas, we had several bills introduced, forcing vaccines on people, changing all the parameters, taking away the informed consent and stuff like that.
[00:54:56.887 --> 00:55:01.108]  And those were all defeated before they even got to our governor, who I think would have vetoed them anyway.
[00:55:01.468 --> 00:55:05.650]  He seems to be a parental choice type governor.
[00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:12.673]  But I think what really influenced those guys a lot in California was how much the drug makers were giving to California lawmakers.
[00:55:12.693 --> 00:55:15.414]  That came out in the Sacramento Bee on June 18th.
[00:55:15.434 --> 00:55:19.116]  The industry gave more than $2 million to current lawmakers in 2013-2014.
[00:55:19.136 --> 00:55:30.461]  Not only was there that money, but in some cases they were whining and dining these lawmakers and donating to them as well.
[00:55:30.621 --> 00:55:33.762]  So one of the lawmakers, they actually found out that
[00:55:34.571 --> 00:55:45.878]  He, him and his wife did this trip to Hawaii that had this really nice expensive dinner at this really nice restaurant with somebody from the pharmaceutical company.
[00:55:45.918 --> 00:55:47.279]  I mean, this is what's going on.
[00:55:47.419 --> 00:55:53.143]  So these guys are supposed to be representing us and that's all they're supposed to be doing.
[00:55:53.343 --> 00:55:55.204]  So for this to even pass,
[00:55:56.018 --> 00:55:59.241]  Trust me, there's going to be some huge backlash.
[00:55:59.602 --> 00:56:03.365]  Well, you know, you look at people like Richard Pan got $95,000.
[00:56:03.785 --> 00:56:05.047]  Assembly Speaker Tony Atkins $90,000.
[00:56:05.167 --> 00:56:09.190]  I mean, these are substantial amounts of money that these guys are getting.
[00:56:11.232 --> 00:56:15.036]  Of course, you could see why they sell out, but that's not why they're put in that position.
[00:56:15.076 --> 00:56:23.084]  They're put in that position to actually stand up for the rights of the people, not for these giant corporations who just, for them, it's a game changer.
[00:56:23.104 --> 00:56:25.926]  For them, they can just force as many vaccines as they want on people.
[00:56:26.307 --> 00:56:28.168]  They've been shown to have adverse reactions.
[00:56:28.909 --> 00:56:33.533]  And so it's the parents' choice in which, you know, to give their kids these vaccines.
[00:56:33.573 --> 00:56:36.215]  And that's what really has pissed a lot of people off.
[00:56:36.535 --> 00:56:41.219]  Even Jim Carrey came out against it, forcing this kind of medical tyranny on us.
[00:56:41.259 --> 00:56:45.963]  And, you know, I'd just like to note, cycling has killed about 109 people in 2013, and measles has killed no one.
[00:56:50.467 --> 00:57:01.473]  And yet the reason this has all come about is because measles supposedly happened in Disneyland, started there, which it was also spread by people who had the measles or had the measles vaccine, at least.
[00:57:02.293 --> 00:57:06.756]  And so that it's just this this fear factor they push that, oh, you're going to get the measles.
[00:57:07.236 --> 00:57:11.078]  When I was a kid and probably when you were younger, too, we got the measles.
[00:57:11.098 --> 00:57:11.799]  You got the measles.
[00:57:12.539 --> 00:57:12.839]  Right.
[00:57:12.899 --> 00:57:13.960]  You missed a few days of school.
[00:57:14.878 --> 00:57:18.319]  You know, they also have a mandatory chicken pox vaccine.
[00:57:18.359 --> 00:57:19.980]  It's like, wow, who didn't have chicken pox?
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:21.481]  I mean, even watch the Brady Bunch.
[00:57:21.541 --> 00:57:23.181]  The whole family had chicken pox.
[00:57:23.201 --> 00:57:29.444]  And in fact, when one kid would get it, you'd throw all your other kids in the same room and make them all get it at the same time and be done with it.
[00:57:29.464 --> 00:57:29.884]  Yeah.
[00:57:30.444 --> 00:57:31.985]  I was the last kid in my family to get it.
[00:57:32.185 --> 00:57:34.566]  And I got the worst case of it.
[00:57:34.606 --> 00:57:36.727]  I had the scars on the soles of my feet.
[00:57:37.327 --> 00:57:37.647]  Didn't I?
[00:57:37.827 --> 00:57:38.368]  It is not pleasant.
[00:57:38.548 --> 00:57:39.108]  I was fine.
[00:57:39.128 --> 00:57:43.831]  I watched, uh, watched TV for a week and, you know, ate, uh, you know, ate in front of the TV.
[00:57:43.871 --> 00:57:47.193]  It was just a good time just sitting around doing nothing, reading comic books and stuff.
[00:57:47.293 --> 00:57:51.876]  Yeah, you get to stay home, eat ice cream, drink 7-Up, and, and, like you said, watch TV.
[00:57:51.896 --> 00:57:55.318]  Of course, back then we didn't have cable, but, you know, hey, it was still good.
[00:57:55.539 --> 00:58:03.023]  But I'll tell you something that's really disturbing to me, and that is, our legislature and these, I call them paranoid vaxxers.
[00:58:03.083 --> 00:58:05.245]  I mean, they have really, really,
[00:58:06.075 --> 00:58:06.495]  I think so.
[00:58:31.616 --> 00:58:31.936]  Right.
[00:58:31.956 --> 00:58:32.056]  Right.
[00:58:50.123 --> 00:58:56.792]  No, we actually read the medical inserts that are provided by the companies that say these things cause problems and don't take them if you're pregnant especially.
[00:58:56.812 --> 00:58:59.375]  Hey, finishing up real quick, we're about to run out of time.
[00:58:59.515 --> 00:59:04.442]  You have some breaking news that you're working with a former gubernatorial candidate of California.
[00:59:05.359 --> 00:59:08.820]  Yes, actually, I am now working with Tim Donnelly.
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:14.141]  He's a former assemblyman here in the state of California, and he also ran for governor in 2014.
[00:59:15.282 --> 00:59:18.602]  We have decided to start the referendum process.
[00:59:19.043 --> 00:59:24.504]  Mr. Donnelly filed that this morning with the Attorney General's office, and it's already on their website.
[00:59:26.018 --> 00:59:40.146]  We had to roll this out pretty quickly because some pro-SB-277 people were actually in the process of organizing what I would call a sham referendum, where they would soak up all the donor money, they would take all the volunteers.
[00:59:40.746 --> 00:59:41.346]  I think so.
[01:00:01.016 --> 01:00:02.717]  That's the only way this stuff is going to work out.
[01:00:02.757 --> 01:00:07.901]  So, California, SB277recalls, SB277recalls.com.
[01:00:08.221 --> 01:00:10.202]  And that's going to do it for tonight's show.
[01:00:10.543 --> 01:00:11.543]  I'm your host, Rob Due.
[01:00:11.563 --> 01:00:14.805]  It's been a pleasure doing the first day of the month here in July.
[01:00:14.866 --> 01:00:19.669]  We are already halfway done with 2015, and it has definitely turned into a humdinger of a year.

[01:00:48.936 --> 01:00:53.298]  And the perfect storm I'm going to discuss is a really good perfect storm.
[01:00:54.038 --> 01:01:07.605]  I have prayed, literally, to be able to find a high quality gun sponsor that is affordable and that is extremely well made and effective that I can promote to my audience.
