[00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:16.180]  Well, this Thursday brought more news from the Obama-run Justice Department.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:25.166]  Dennis Hastert, the former Speaker of the House, the longest-serving Republican Speaker in history,
[00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.782]  Was indicted by the FBI today.
[00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:30.883]  Now let's get one thing straight.
[00:00:31.704 --> 00:00:33.986]  I hate Denny Hastert.
[00:00:34.807 --> 00:00:39.992]  The globalist, NSA, tyranny-supporting frontman.
[00:00:40.914 --> 00:01:02.525]  And I remember interviewing investigative journalist Wayne Madsen, who's on the show tomorrow, the Friday radio show, many times, where he said that Dennis Hastert reportedly was being blackmailed for sexual improprieties with some of the senior members of the high school wrestling team that he brought to the championship level.
[00:01:03.405 --> 00:01:07.927]  And if one reads the indictment, it looks like that that's exactly what was going on.
[00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:18.932]  He paid a million and a half dollars, reportedly, allegedly, of three plus million he promised to someone to cover up a impropriety that he had committed.
[00:01:19.773 --> 00:01:20.453]  Now let's be clear.
[00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:22.734]  I don't like Dennis Hastert.
[00:01:22.774 --> 00:01:24.095]  I don't like the Republican leadership.
[00:01:25.057 --> 00:01:30.259]  It was the Republican leadership that just went along with the TPP selling out our sovereignty in the Senate.
[00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:32.800]  But they don't have the votes in the House.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.682]  And guess who Mr. Hastert is closely associated with and who was his underling?
[00:01:39.462 --> 00:01:42.843]  Speaker of the House, John Boehner.
[00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:52.226]  This is a major shot across the bow of the Republican leadership to get in line and do whatever Obama says or they'll be indicted.
[00:01:52.944 --> 00:01:56.626]  These guys weren't led into positions of power unless they were compromised.
[00:01:57.007 --> 00:02:05.232]  That's why Mr. Hastert was taken from nowhere and basically put in the Speakership only after a few years in the House of Representatives.
[00:02:05.772 --> 00:02:06.633]  Unheard of.
[00:02:07.153 --> 00:02:09.015]  Because he was incredibly compromised.
[00:02:09.535 --> 00:02:11.736]  But there's a whole other issue here, not just blackmail.
[00:02:13.197 --> 00:02:16.760]  Undoubtedly, this White House is the most corrupt I've ever seen.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.861]  He makes Nixon look like an angel.
[00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:20.162]  And Nixon was a tyrant.
[00:02:21.555 --> 00:02:23.542]  They've been going after Rick Perry.
[00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:27.420]  for state vetoes that are totally legal.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.901]  I don't like Rick Perry.
[00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:29.862]  It's just a fact.
[00:02:30.222 --> 00:02:32.624]  They put Dinesh D'Souza, the filmmaker, in prison.
[00:02:32.844 --> 00:02:33.724]  He's still there now.
[00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:36.206]  They're going after all these Republican governors.
[00:02:36.606 --> 00:02:38.287]  They're indicting people left and right.
[00:02:38.548 --> 00:02:41.570]  When they ran Fast and Furious, they ran Benghazi.
[00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:51.917]  Hillary gets tens of millions of dollars a year for the Clinton Foundation from foreign dictators so that the State Department would sign off on illegal arms shipments?
[00:02:52.737 --> 00:02:58.282]  This is like Satan indicting one of his lower demons, Slimer.
[00:02:59.484 --> 00:03:09.113]  This is like the top mob boss, John Gotti, sitting as the judge over one of his street thugs that was caught shaking out an old lady.
[00:03:09.714 --> 00:03:10.835]  It's the hypocrisy.
[00:03:10.855 --> 00:03:12.076]  I mean, here's a parallel.
[00:03:13.097 --> 00:03:14.218]  An allegory, an example.
[00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.341]  I am for the death penalty, biologically.
[00:03:18.047 --> 00:03:27.938]  I believe at a tribal level, if a tribe caught some guy killing a kid or killing a woman or something, there was 10 witnesses, you stone them to death, you throw them off a cliff, you burn them, you know, you strangle them, you kill them.
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.684]  But you can't trust a corrupt government that's been proven to be framing people.
[00:03:33.732 --> 00:03:40.114]  As the DNA is showing to carry out the death penalty, so I'm against the death penalty because you can't trust the system to implement it.
[00:03:40.674 --> 00:03:41.534]  It's the same thing here.
[00:03:41.914 --> 00:03:52.657]  We have a one-sided reign of terror by the Democratic Party that is attempting a total takeover of society right now, and the Republicans, when they're in power, leave the Democrats alone.
[00:03:54.877 --> 00:03:55.477]  It's sick!
[00:03:55.618 --> 00:04:01.259]  I mean, the Democrats, even when the Republicans do everything they want, and are totally intimidated,
[00:04:02.085 --> 00:04:04.106]  The Democrats continue this reign of terror.
[00:04:04.146 --> 00:04:07.368]  I mean, I think about all the people this Justice Department is indicting.
[00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.830]  And they got rid of Holder because of his corruption with the IRS probe.
[00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:15.013]  And Fast and Furious have put this new minion in as the Attorney General.
[00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:18.455]  And so the reign of terror in Obama's last year and a half is starting.
[00:04:19.996 --> 00:04:23.198]  And if we don't get even a two-party system going in this country, we're in trouble.
[00:04:23.438 --> 00:04:25.219]  We need two parties to keep each other in check.
[00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.982]  Not the Democrats running roughshod like the Nazi Party or something taking over.
[00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:38.572]  One part of me loves to see the disgusting colon on two legs that is hastered in trouble.
[00:04:39.432 --> 00:04:48.755]  But my intellectual side goes, no, this is part of an unfair persecution of somebody who compared to the rest of them, quite frankly, is nothing.
[00:04:49.415 --> 00:04:50.276]  I mean, look at Penn State.
[00:04:50.316 --> 00:04:51.696]  That's a giant pedophile ring.
[00:04:51.976 --> 00:04:52.756]  The whole thing.
[00:04:52.776 --> 00:04:53.597]  All right, folks.
[00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.785]  That's part of a report I shot downtown last night.
[00:04:57.825 --> 00:04:59.769]  Went over to a friend's house and put that report up.
[00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:02.434]  We're live on this Friday, 29th edition.
[00:05:02.954 --> 00:05:03.455]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.495 --> 00:05:05.439]  It's a huge transmission straight ahead.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.601]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:10.404 --> 00:05:17.510]  Police departments and law enforcement agencies around the world have been using radar devices for a very long time.
[00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:25.337]  But now, new technology is being used that allows police officers to see and detect movement through solid walls.
[00:05:25.798 --> 00:05:31.723]  It requires no warrant for the cops to spy on you, right there in the privacy of your own home.
[00:05:32.023 --> 00:05:35.344]  USA Today is reporting that at least 50 U.S.
[00:05:35.404 --> 00:05:44.506]  law enforcement agencies have secretly equipped their officers with radar devices that allow them to effectively peer through the walls of houses.
[00:05:44.806 --> 00:05:47.787]  And it has been confirmed with the FBI and the U.S.
[00:05:47.867 --> 00:05:50.468]  Marshals Services that both agencies
[00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:54.251]  ...are using this technology without obtaining warrants.
[00:05:54.592 --> 00:05:55.192]  But of course.
[00:05:55.573 --> 00:06:04.561]  And now there is even more advanced technology being introduced with 3D capabilities that are capable of being mounted on drones.
[00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:09.646]  For more reports and today's breaking news, go to InfoWars.com.
[00:06:10.006 --> 00:06:26.443]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:06:26.683 --> 00:06:30.187]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[00:06:30.527 --> 00:06:34.189]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:35.830]  HDfirearms.com.

[00:07:08.646 --> 00:07:10.707]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[00:07:10.747 --> 00:07:11.167]  Good, brother.
[00:07:11.307 --> 00:07:12.988]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:07:13.028 --> 00:07:14.809]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:18.811]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives.
[00:07:18.931 --> 00:07:23.853]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.

[00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:39.860]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.401]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:44.122]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[00:07:44.602 --> 00:07:45.242]  We're good to go.
[00:08:21.594 --> 00:08:29.376]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:33.897 --> 00:08:36.958]  It is head-spinning, the news that is here in front of me today.
[00:08:37.038 --> 00:08:42.599]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live, Friday, worldwide broadcast, the 29th day of May, 2015.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.560]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:46.921 --> 00:08:48.261]  Head-spinning, to say the least.
[00:08:51.314 --> 00:09:02.456]  First off today, we're going to cover the indictment that broke after the broadcast in the afternoon yesterday of the longest serving Republican Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert.
[00:09:04.257 --> 00:09:17.860]  Dennis Hastert was a horrible neocon rhino, an open borders promoting, high tax promoting, Patriot Act, police state promoting blob.
[00:09:19.963 --> 00:09:25.365]  And I remember many times having Wayne Madsen on the broadcast, formerly with the National Security Agency.
[00:09:32.888 --> 00:09:45.553]  I remember having him on many, many times, and him saying that Dennis Hastert was compromised, Dennis Hastert was blackmailed, and that Dennis Hastert basically
[00:09:47.591 --> 00:09:51.293]  molested wrestlers when he was a high school wrestling coach.
[00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:54.894]  Now, a lot of guests get up on air and say things like that.
[00:09:55.014 --> 00:09:57.175]  I'll kick them off the show or I'll delay them.
[00:09:58.376 --> 00:10:02.597]  I'll sit there and basically erase on live radio what they're saying.
[00:10:02.837 --> 00:10:12.301]  I don't do that very often, but if something isn't already substantiated, or if I haven't documented it myself, I don't put that out.
[00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.083]  But Madsen is an investigative journalist.
[00:10:15.103 --> 00:10:15.923]  He went and spent
[00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:25.763]  I don't know, since Obama's been in office and before, probably over all six, eight months that I know of, inside Chicago, sniffing around.
[00:10:27.244 --> 00:10:31.286]  Substantiating that Obama goes to bathhouses and has homosexual sex.
[00:10:32.106 --> 00:10:36.709]  Substantiating that the mayor there does that as well, from his sources.
[00:10:36.789 --> 00:10:41.231]  Substantiating that Hastert's involved in all sorts of activities, reportedly.
[00:10:42.231 --> 00:10:44.793]  This is why they put them all basically in power.
[00:10:46.414 --> 00:11:00.522]  And it's why they burned the governor, who was just in with the whole group in basic mafia activity, was to send a message to Obama, and everybody else, you'll do exactly what you're told, when you're told.
[00:11:05.004 --> 00:11:15.630]  So, I'm not sad that Mr. Hastert has been indicted, and I've read the indictment, and he did what all these idiots do, he lied to the government,
[00:11:16.854 --> 00:11:17.815]  Basically under oath.
[00:11:17.855 --> 00:11:18.835]  There's a federal law.
[00:11:19.135 --> 00:11:21.536]  When you're talking to the FBI, it's basically under oath.
[00:11:21.877 --> 00:11:26.159]  I don't think it's constitutional, but regardless, he said the money he was taking out was for him.
[00:11:26.699 --> 00:11:28.540]  How about talk to the hand?
[00:11:30.941 --> 00:11:34.103]  How about, you guys want to cook something up?
[00:11:36.524 --> 00:11:37.625]  Go do it on your own.
[00:11:38.585 --> 00:11:39.686]  I'm not talking to you.
[00:11:42.278 --> 00:11:51.924]  But Hastert reportedly, allegedly lied to the FBI about what was going on.
[00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:57.368]  And the $3 million he was going to pay this individual, he paid him a million and a half dollars reportedly.
[00:11:59.508 --> 00:12:02.270]  In $10,000 or under $10,000 increments, trying to hide it.
[00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:07.253]  As if the government doesn't notice someone trying to take out under $10,000.
[00:12:08.093 --> 00:12:11.716]  Christmas has come up before, and I'm handing out bonuses at the office, and then to friends and family.
[00:12:12.196 --> 00:12:20.841]  And I'll say, with 50-something employees and family and everything, I'll say, go get $12,000 out of the company bank.
[00:12:22.082 --> 00:12:25.744]  And other people say to me, well, go under that.
[00:12:26.765 --> 00:12:27.886]  It's after-tax money.
[00:12:28.752 --> 00:12:29.893]  We're not hiding it!
[00:12:31.274 --> 00:12:34.436]  But see, this is the whole mindset of what it's like to live under tyranny.
[00:12:35.577 --> 00:12:37.919]  Where people think normal activity is illegal.
[00:12:37.979 --> 00:12:40.941]  So, this whole thing is bigger than Dennis Hastert.
[00:12:43.106 --> 00:12:49.828]  And if you want to know why this is happening now, hands down, I don't know what Wayne Madsen is going to say when he comes on, but he really knows his stuff.
[00:12:49.848 --> 00:12:51.429]  Formerly with the National Security Agency.
[00:12:51.449 --> 00:12:58.291]  If you're watching C-SPAN and watching a national security hearing, you'll almost always see him in the audience.
[00:12:59.471 --> 00:13:01.332]  You'll see him in the audience of the National Press Club.
[00:13:01.792 --> 00:13:03.252]  He really knows his stuff.
[00:13:03.973 --> 00:13:07.994]  I've interviewed three or four people that he put me in contact with that end up dead.
[00:13:09.042 --> 00:13:09.703]  Like the D.C.
[00:13:09.743 --> 00:13:10.043]  Madam.
[00:13:10.803 --> 00:13:14.206]  I mean, the stuff he's on to is not child's play.
[00:13:15.007 --> 00:13:15.607]  It's real.
[00:13:17.309 --> 00:13:20.511]  This is big boy pants stuff here on this radio show.
[00:13:21.252 --> 00:13:23.353]  We go where nobody else dares to go.
[00:13:24.675 --> 00:13:25.856]  Because it's our duty to do it.
[00:13:25.936 --> 00:13:28.418]  We're not showing off, and I've said it's not fun.
[00:13:32.761 --> 00:13:37.125]  So he's joining us at the bottom of the hour, and there's just a cornucopia of other important news, obviously.
[00:13:38.459 --> 00:13:39.699]  We have the indictment right here.
[00:13:39.719 --> 00:13:42.700]  I'll give you a document cam shot of that and put it on screen.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.261]  And the Washington Post asked the big question.
[00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:57.123]  They say, what is the impropriety that he supposedly admitted to that he'd wronged someone that he was going to pay them $3 million?
[00:14:00.364 --> 00:14:03.705]  Well, it has to do, the indictment says, with his time from 81 to 2007.
[00:14:09.793 --> 00:14:12.994]  And it gets into his time as a wrestling coach.
[00:14:19.477 --> 00:14:37.425]  Now, I'm not saying he's guilty of all this, but you don't get to that level of power now of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and Dennis Hastert and John Boehner and Mitch McConnell unless they've got skeletons in the closet that can destroy them at any time.
[00:14:38.849 --> 00:14:57.883]  In the film adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, that's not very good compared to the book, Baron Harkonnen adds heart plugs to people, where you can just pull a plug out, like the top of a carton of milk, and it opens up the side of your heart and all your blood sprays out against the wall.
[00:15:03.506 --> 00:15:08.170]  And that's basically what all these politicians have, is political heart plugs.
[00:15:09.813 --> 00:15:25.949]  So that anytime they want, they can just sick the Federal Bureau of Investigation in there that knows full well the big banks laundered almost all the drug money, run the aircraft, run the child sex slave rings, the snuff films, all of it.
[00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:31.554]  It even comes out in the news that, you know, DynCorp is involved in giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:15:31.915 --> 00:15:33.997]  Nobody gets in trouble for kids in dungeons.
[00:15:36.411 --> 00:15:45.073]  They only burned Denny Hastert to send a message right now to Boehner, and to McConnell, and to the Democrats, not just Republicans.
[00:15:45.533 --> 00:15:46.433]  You get in line.
[00:15:46.853 --> 00:15:51.834]  We don't care if polls are 87 to 90 percent against TPP global treaty.
[00:15:52.834 --> 00:15:54.615]  We don't care how tyrannical it is.
[00:15:54.775 --> 00:15:55.435]  We don't care.
[00:15:55.895 --> 00:16:01.096]  You do what you're told, and then even when you're voted out of office, we're going to go ahead and indict you anyways.
[00:16:03.517 --> 00:16:04.877]  They're running scared.
[00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:10.361]  We have a captured, blackmailed, intimidated government.
[00:16:14.084 --> 00:16:23.010]  And folks, we got people like Colonel Schaeffer, who ran the anti-bin Laden operation that could have killed him twice, and the White House ordered him to stand down.
[00:16:23.571 --> 00:16:31.557]  He simply complained to the Defense Committee in the House, the Armed Services Committee, and they began the move to indict him with the FBI.
[00:16:34.056 --> 00:16:50.402]  For 60-something dollars in phone bills, saying he couldn't call his wife as a colonel, saying he'd be late to dinner when he got back to the U.S., and that it was stealing to use his phone, to what, what was the investigation?
[00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:55.453]  It said he was, he called, I think it was a Jiffy Lube or something.
[00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:59.355]  He called a lube place to have his car set up an appointment.
[00:16:59.375 --> 00:17:00.396]  He called his wife.
[00:17:00.416 --> 00:17:04.539]  Of course, anybody knows that an officer in the U.S.
[00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:06.200]  military can call their wife on their phone.
[00:17:07.381 --> 00:17:09.342]  This is though, this is what they'll come after you for.
[00:17:09.843 --> 00:17:11.804]  They will indict a ham sandwich.
[00:17:13.005 --> 00:17:14.966]  As it was once famously said, I forget by who.
[00:17:15.607 --> 00:17:18.349]  You guys Google who said you can indict a ham sandwich.
[00:17:18.389 --> 00:17:19.930]  I think it was Jim Garrison.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.741]  This is what we're dealing with here.
[00:17:25.721 --> 00:17:26.542]  It's crazy town.
[00:17:29.023 --> 00:17:32.424]  And by the way, if you don't have any corruption in your background, they'll make it up.
[00:17:34.384 --> 00:17:40.747]  Or they'll call up your wife and harass her and threaten to attack your family until your wife cracks up.
[00:17:45.428 --> 00:17:49.410]  That was New York State Chief Judge Saul
[00:17:52.409 --> 00:18:02.578]  Latchler was famously quoted by Tom Wolfe in the Bonfire of the Vanities that a grand jury would indict a ham sandwich if that's what you wanted.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.862]  I guess it was repeated by Jim Garrison.
[00:18:09.164 --> 00:18:13.805]  So when I put out that alert video last night, a minority of people were saying, why are you defending Dennis Astert?
[00:18:13.825 --> 00:18:14.785]  Why are you being partisan?
[00:18:15.605 --> 00:18:16.666]  I'm not being partisan.
[00:18:16.706 --> 00:18:17.886]  I'm telling it like it is.
[00:18:18.006 --> 00:18:20.366]  I've been watching politics closely for 25 years.
[00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:22.407]  I've been on air for 20, immersed in it.
[00:18:29.448 --> 00:18:37.430]  And they are targeting Republicans, this Democratic Party, and journalists, and their own people.
[00:18:38.729 --> 00:18:44.671]  And free speech and whistleblowers at an exponential level about three times what it's ever been before.
[00:18:46.011 --> 00:18:55.014]  And that's basically a quote by Jonathan Turley, constitutional lawyer and a big liberal, that Obama is engaged in basically triple the persecution of free speech and freedom.
[00:18:56.834 --> 00:18:58.995]  And it's because he's completely blackmailed himself.
[00:18:59.095 --> 00:19:05.897]  I mean, my gosh, his father is a famous communist publisher and pornographer, Frank Marshall Davis.
[00:19:07.694 --> 00:19:13.120]  They had to tweet the president questions yesterday as if he was really responding himself.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.503]  And so we asked him, does he ever visit Frank Marshall Davis's grave?
[00:19:16.883 --> 00:19:17.884]  Might want to retweet that.
[00:19:17.925 --> 00:19:19.626]  That's up on Real Alex Jones.
[00:19:19.666 --> 00:19:30.838]  But filmmakers like Dinesh D'Souza, Rick Perry, last time I heard, they're still trying to put him in jail for vetoing funding.
[00:19:33.598 --> 00:19:43.691]  For a county initiative to fight official corruption, and then the person running it is spitting on police and attacking people and acting like a total maniac?
[00:19:44.372 --> 00:19:45.654]  So they indict Rick Perry?
[00:19:45.734 --> 00:19:50.260]  I mean, that's a local issue, but the Democrats are just running wild.
[00:19:51.381 --> 00:20:03.837]  When they themselves, Fast and Furious, Benghazi, the Clinton donors, foreign dictators give her money so the State Department head, the Secretary of State, she would sell them the weapons.
[00:20:04.418 --> 00:20:05.599]  Authorize the weapon sales.
[00:20:05.659 --> 00:20:07.001]  I mean, it's crazy!
[00:20:10.678 --> 00:20:13.259]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[00:21:10.054 --> 00:21:13.579]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:14.821]  It's true.
[00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:18.887]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:21:19.088 --> 00:21:20.950]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:25.958]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[00:24:23.334 --> 00:24:29.056]  This weekend, in Phoenix, they're having a Draw the Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest in Phoenix.
[00:24:30.077 --> 00:24:35.779]  Joe Biggs had the idea to fly out there as soon as it became apparent that ISIS was claiming they're going to hit it.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.301]  This morning I called and said, hey, send Joe Biggs if he wants to go.
[00:24:40.321 --> 00:24:46.884]  And Joe Biggs was already going to an airport, had already been authorized by Rob Due, our news director, to go.
[00:24:48.717 --> 00:24:50.218]  So I love the initiative of Joe Biggs.
[00:24:50.578 --> 00:24:52.080]  He'll be there covering that.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:57.544]  Hundreds expected outside Phoenix Mosque at Muhammad Cartoon Contest.
[00:24:59.028 --> 00:25:04.792]  And there's former Marines and others are in the CNN article saying he has no middle ground when it comes to Islam.
[00:25:05.132 --> 00:25:07.673]  His t-shirt pretty much says it all, F Islam.
[00:25:08.634 --> 00:25:14.898]  Rich Hemmer is the organizer of Friday's Freedom of Speech Rally outside the Islamic Community Center in Phoenix.
[00:25:15.618 --> 00:25:20.141]  It's the mosque that Elton Simpson and Nader Sufi attended for a time.
[00:25:20.601 --> 00:25:25.124]  They're the men who drove from Arizona to Dallas suburb to shoot up the Prophet
[00:25:27.196 --> 00:25:28.817]  Mohammed cartoon contest there.
[00:25:29.497 --> 00:25:30.598]  Both were killed by police.
[00:25:31.678 --> 00:25:37.201]  Many Muslims consider demeaning depictions of Mohammed to be blasphemous and banned by Islamic law.
[00:25:38.241 --> 00:25:38.762]  Here's the deal.
[00:25:38.882 --> 00:25:40.763]  I'm not Islamophobic, as they call it.
[00:25:40.783 --> 00:25:46.225]  I know there are a lot of good Muslims that are good people, a lot of smart scientists, you know, nice folks.
[00:25:48.006 --> 00:25:51.908]  The problem is radical Islam is being funded by Saudi Arabia and the West.
[00:25:52.488 --> 00:25:53.709]  It's being allowed to take over.
[00:25:53.769 --> 00:25:55.610]  It's combined forces with the left.
[00:25:57.345 --> 00:25:58.567]  And it is just breeding.
[00:25:59.568 --> 00:26:04.753]  And whereas I don't want to be confrontational at the same time, the First Amendment needs to be upheld.
[00:26:05.213 --> 00:26:10.639]  And they just want to have this multicultural takeover, and everybody just lays down to it, and people aren't going to lay down anymore.
[00:26:12.942 --> 00:26:13.582]  People are done.
[00:26:15.484 --> 00:26:18.267]  And so, things are going to be escalating.
[00:26:18.588 --> 00:26:19.709]  That certainly is clear.
[00:26:22.691 --> 00:26:29.356]  Now, I want to shift gears out of that back into the Dennis Hassard situation, then we're going to get into Julian Assange says TPP.
[00:26:30.017 --> 00:26:31.197]  We have the clip coming up of this.
[00:26:31.678 --> 00:26:35.641]  Only 5 of 29 sanctions are about traditional trade.
[00:26:37.059 --> 00:26:43.360]  Well, we're glad, Mr. Assange, that you want to be the important guy, so you won't release the entire 30-plus parts.
[00:26:43.981 --> 00:26:55.163]  You've only released the part on the Internet that's the most draconian, Internet-killing, taxing, regulating, three strikes, you're banned from the web, corporate boards decide, no due process.
[00:26:56.063 --> 00:26:59.444]  What are you doing not releasing all the sections?
[00:26:59.464 --> 00:27:00.444]  Because they now say there's only 29.
[00:27:00.485 --> 00:27:01.405]  There were 33 sections.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.282]  Back when they first said Wikileaks had the info.
[00:27:06.743 --> 00:27:09.125]  And so that video's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:27:09.145 --> 00:27:10.546]  Again, we'll play a clip of the next segment.
[00:27:11.007 --> 00:27:15.811]  And I don't want to sit here and just bash Wikileaks, but they dole out what they want, when they want.
[00:27:17.753 --> 00:27:22.137]  We know what they've done in the EU, and we know what they've done under the NAU, and this is just more of that.
[00:27:22.897 --> 00:27:26.220]  It is anti-gun, it is open border, it is globalism.
[00:27:27.241 --> 00:27:29.063]  It is free speech restrictions, it's everything.
[00:27:30.222 --> 00:27:32.063]  But why won't WikiLeaks release it?
[00:27:32.904 --> 00:27:34.165]  Congress won't release it.
[00:27:36.227 --> 00:27:37.167]  Amnesty is secret.
[00:27:37.788 --> 00:27:39.229]  Secret trade deals are secret.
[00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:40.990]  But the point is, it's not a trade deal.
[00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.552]  It's a global government treaty.
[00:27:44.973 --> 00:27:48.136]  Assisted suicide bills advancing California legislature.
[00:27:48.236 --> 00:27:51.619]  Fukushima produce making its way into international stores here in the U.S.
[00:27:55.287 --> 00:27:56.508]  Huge news on the economy.
[00:27:56.588 --> 00:27:56.808]  U.S.
[00:27:56.828 --> 00:27:58.009]  economy contracted to 0.7.
[00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:00.970]  It was 0.2.
[00:28:01.371 --> 00:28:04.152]  But now we learn that this happened in the first quarter.
[00:28:05.473 --> 00:28:06.254]  That's all coming up.
[00:28:07.474 --> 00:28:12.597]  But just finishing up on my points on Dennis Hastert, the Speaker of the House, being indicted yesterday by the FBI.
[00:28:14.338 --> 00:28:18.301]  You can just go to InfoWars.com and read the indictment for yourself.
[00:28:19.682 --> 00:28:20.722]  This is a grand jury.
[00:28:24.104 --> 00:28:24.805]  A year ago,
[00:28:27.262 --> 00:28:29.183]  Basically back in February 2014.
[00:28:30.904 --> 00:28:34.966]  And they're just now rolling these out.
[00:28:35.346 --> 00:28:42.890]  They waited until they got rid of the Attorney General, who's totally discredited, to put a new puppet to carry out the exact same operations of political persecution.
[00:28:44.371 --> 00:28:51.934]  Dennis Hastert is a horrible poster child, poster goblin, for everything wrong with the Republican Party.
[00:28:51.995 --> 00:28:52.695]  I don't like him.
[00:28:53.275 --> 00:28:55.636]  He is just a Republican in name only.
[00:28:55.676 --> 00:28:56.637]  He is a horrible creature.
[00:28:58.345 --> 00:29:08.791]  And Wayne Madsen has said many times he's connected reportedly to molesting young men there at the high school.
[00:29:09.751 --> 00:29:11.592]  And that's what this indictment seems to point towards.
[00:29:11.632 --> 00:29:13.553]  He was trying to cover up something at the high school.
[00:29:14.034 --> 00:29:15.555]  And it paid the person a million and a half dollars.
[00:29:16.535 --> 00:29:22.338]  The issue is the FBI knows about the government drug dealing, the central banks owning the aircraft.
[00:29:22.698 --> 00:29:23.379]  It's all come out.
[00:29:23.459 --> 00:29:24.039]  They do nothing.
[00:29:24.199 --> 00:29:25.080]  They're allowed to do nothing.
[00:29:25.993 --> 00:29:29.174]  Fifteen of the nineteen hijackers, they were ordered to let them in, had to stand down.
[00:29:29.594 --> 00:29:30.394]  They wanted to bust them.
[00:29:30.594 --> 00:29:35.095]  The point is, the FBI is allowed to go after who the system wants them to go after.
[00:29:35.435 --> 00:29:37.676]  They don't go after the billionaires, they don't go after the globalists.
[00:29:37.996 --> 00:29:47.458]  They're burning politicians occasionally to send a message, you do what you're told, no matter how unpopular TPP is, no matter how unpopular
[00:29:48.667 --> 00:29:53.791]  All this garbage is, you go along with it, or we're gonna put you under the jail.
[00:29:54.491 --> 00:29:56.693]  And this is how our country is captured and controlled.
[00:29:57.293 --> 00:30:02.777]  The FBI is so discredited, they have no business indicting anybody, or having a grand jury indict anybody.
[00:30:03.698 --> 00:30:06.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.561]  I mean, look at the crime lab.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:23.842]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[00:30:25.134 --> 00:30:36.904]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[00:30:37.124 --> 00:30:53.418]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[00:30:53.858 --> 00:30:58.445]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming, it's already here.
[00:30:58.866 --> 00:31:02.611]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance.
[00:31:03.092 --> 00:31:04.814]  InfoWars.com
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:13.982]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:31:14.142 --> 00:31:18.104]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[00:31:36.894 --> 00:31:38.194]  Alex Jones here.
[00:31:38.374 --> 00:31:49.638]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:31:49.858 --> 00:31:53.239]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[00:33:26.778 --> 00:33:35.286]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:43.308 --> 00:33:51.953]  Wayne Madsen is going to be joining us in a moment, a real expert on Denny Hastert, the now indicted former Speaker of the House, the Republican.
[00:33:52.773 --> 00:34:01.678]  This is undoubtedly a political action by the Democratic Party that is involved in a political reign of terror, going after journalists, whistleblowers, you name it.
[00:34:02.598 --> 00:34:05.580]  Though I have no doubt that where there's smoke, there's fire.
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.841]  Hastert's probably guilty.
[00:34:08.166 --> 00:34:15.009]  From the sources I have, it looks like they've got a pretty clear-cut case here, but I don't know Wayne Madsen's take on it yet.
[00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:15.890]  We're about to find out.
[00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:27.236]  Investigative journalist, former NSA officer Wayne Madsen, but he has said for a long time Hastert was totally compromised and that it was reportedly dealing with ties back to when he was a wrestling coach.
[00:34:27.896 --> 00:34:29.738]  No one else I'd ever heard say that.
[00:34:30.178 --> 00:34:44.312]  Madsen has incredible sources, has spent upwards of half a year off and on in Illinois investigating the whole crime syndicate there, so we'll talk to him for the news behind the news, the story behind the story, the rest of the story, as Paul Harvey would say in a moment.
[00:34:44.673 --> 00:34:49.317]  But first, a new intro promo that our own Jakari Jackson put together.
[00:34:49.698 --> 00:34:51.560]  I thought we'd premiere that here right now.
[00:34:53.394 --> 00:35:00.597]  In today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully activists.
[00:35:01.377 --> 00:35:09.381]  If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshippers, maybe you can call the A-Team.
[00:35:09.821 --> 00:35:13.343]  And how many did I adopt?
[00:35:13.543 --> 00:35:14.403]  I kill my kids!
[00:35:14.883 --> 00:35:16.184]  I kill my kids!
[00:35:20.796 --> 00:35:26.223]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle.
[00:35:27.004 --> 00:35:27.865]  That's pretty cool, man.
[00:35:29.006 --> 00:35:32.711]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[00:35:32.791 --> 00:35:34.874]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[00:35:35.808 --> 00:35:36.629]  I don't think so.
[00:35:36.949 --> 00:35:39.793]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[00:35:39.893 --> 00:35:40.473]  I pay for them.
[00:35:40.514 --> 00:35:42.095]  Yeah, how many do you pay for them?
[00:35:42.215 --> 00:35:43.277]  Uh, upwards of 50.
[00:35:43.377 --> 00:35:43.617]  Really?
[00:35:43.797 --> 00:35:44.899]  Oh yeah.
[00:35:57.543 --> 00:35:58.784]  You, you piece of s***!
[00:35:59.165 --> 00:36:00.987]  Bunch of misogynist motherf***ers!
[00:36:01.027 --> 00:36:03.170]  Take your male privilege somewhere else!
[00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:04.952]  Tyler, you're being aggressive.
[00:36:05.152 --> 00:36:06.754]  I'm being aggressive!
[00:36:06.774 --> 00:36:08.776]  These, that's the guys that attacked Alex Jones.
[00:36:21.747 --> 00:36:26.870]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:36:27.391 --> 00:36:31.313]  We should call that video, Pro-Abortionists Caught Chanting Satan Again.
[00:36:32.734 --> 00:36:38.898]  Or, new video, Abortionists Worship Satan.
[00:36:40.099 --> 00:36:44.262]  We need to put that video up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:45.979 --> 00:36:48.622]  And look, I'm not here bashing women that have had abortions.
[00:36:48.822 --> 00:36:51.986]  The point is the people driving and pushing it are into the occult.
[00:36:53.688 --> 00:36:55.770]  I just learned this from investigating over the years.
[00:36:57.048 --> 00:37:02.210]  And it's an anti-human, anti-minority movement to get rid of mainly poor black people and Hispanics.
[00:37:02.771 --> 00:37:10.434]  And so I'm just sick of the Democratic Party trying to race bait all day when more blacks have been aborted since Roe v. Wade than have been born.
[00:37:11.095 --> 00:37:12.495]  And there's new numbers out today.
[00:37:13.216 --> 00:37:16.457]  We've aborted more people since Roe v. Wade than lived in the country in 1880.
[00:37:16.757 --> 00:37:19.399]  CNS News reports on that.
[00:37:20.743 --> 00:37:24.426]  Margaret Sanger, the Rockefellers, they taught Hitler everything he knew.
[00:37:24.926 --> 00:37:27.468]  Just admit the roots of what's pushing it.
[00:37:28.229 --> 00:37:28.509]  Okay?
[00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:30.130]  I'm not here judging you.
[00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:33.453]  I'm not here on some high horse saying, blah blah blah, you're a killer.
[00:37:34.571 --> 00:37:36.892]  I've told people that I've been involved in abortions when I was younger.
[00:37:37.432 --> 00:37:38.213]  I think it's bad.
[00:37:38.313 --> 00:37:38.893]  It's wrong.
[00:37:39.313 --> 00:37:40.194]  I've repented of it.
[00:37:40.414 --> 00:37:41.835]  But I'm not here judging you.
[00:37:42.595 --> 00:37:45.857]  I'm simply saying it's treating humans like trash.
[00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:49.359]  And the anti-abortion pro-life people were right back in the 70s.
[00:37:50.039 --> 00:37:50.979]  Then it's old people.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:51.900]  Then it's babies.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.401]  Then it's cripples.
[00:37:54.241 --> 00:37:56.042]  Ooh, I was politically incorrect, but it's okay to kill them.
[00:37:57.083 --> 00:37:59.784]  It's the disabled.
[00:38:00.384 --> 00:38:03.406]  It's the veterans on don't treat list.
[00:38:04.929 --> 00:38:07.171]  And they always confuse it with a right to die argument.
[00:38:08.352 --> 00:38:10.073]  Sure, individuals, I think, have a right to die.
[00:38:10.093 --> 00:38:17.658]  The problem is you can't have the state involved in it, because it'll become euthanasia, and it is euthanasia now, where the state decides to kill you.
[00:38:17.959 --> 00:38:20.060]  See, it's where the agenda comes from.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:32.850]  We're going to Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReport.com, best-selling author, probably one of the most dialed-in, connected people ever.
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:34.941]  I'm surprised he's alive.
[00:38:35.822 --> 00:38:41.028]  A lot of people that he has put on the show, that he's given his contact to, have ended up dead.
[00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:43.210]  I can think of three or four of them right now.
[00:38:43.931 --> 00:38:44.872]  DC Madden and others.
[00:38:44.932 --> 00:38:51.720]  I mean, folks, we've had the Navy SEAL families on about that being a staged raid and saying it was a body double.
[00:38:52.892 --> 00:38:59.103]  Do you think it was fun meeting with people before they went public and knowing all this and being the first person to talk about it?
[00:38:59.444 --> 00:39:01.447]  Well, see, I love my peers.
[00:39:02.108 --> 00:39:04.272]  It feels so good to not be alone.
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:06.821]  And to have people like Wayne Madsen.
[00:39:07.361 --> 00:39:08.442]  I'm not in competition.
[00:39:08.702 --> 00:39:10.884]  I wish there were 50,000 Wayne Madsens.
[00:39:11.424 --> 00:39:13.446]  I wish there was talk show hosts better than I am.
[00:39:14.186 --> 00:39:16.608]  Better authors, better orators, better researchers.
[00:39:17.389 --> 00:39:18.169]  I want to win.
[00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:19.370]  I want to defeat this.
[00:39:20.211 --> 00:39:22.693]  I can feel the hair on the back of my neck standing up, folks.
[00:39:24.134 --> 00:39:25.715]  I got the feds following me around.
[00:39:27.156 --> 00:39:28.557]  Contacting me, threatening me.
[00:39:28.617 --> 00:39:29.398]  I mean, it's not fun.
[00:39:30.418 --> 00:39:32.799]  But then I've got other feds that are good giving us information.
[00:39:33.179 --> 00:39:42.743]  There's a fight between good and evil in government, in corporations, in churches, in businesses, in our neighborhoods, and it's time for good people to stand up and say no.
[00:39:44.284 --> 00:39:48.185]  Briefly, we are funded by viewers and listeners like you.
[00:39:48.265 --> 00:39:52.307]  We bring you the very best nutraceuticals at the highest quality at Infowarslife.com.
[00:39:53.608 --> 00:39:56.389]  We have the highest quality vitamin B12 that we could find.
[00:39:58.097 --> 00:39:59.498]  In fact, no one else sells this.
[00:39:59.998 --> 00:40:06.361]  No one we know of sells medical grade, organic, pure, totally clean.
[00:40:06.381 --> 00:40:08.702]  We have the test published on Infowarslife.com.
[00:40:09.222 --> 00:40:10.283]  Methylcobalamin.
[00:40:10.563 --> 00:40:13.605]  This is the stuff that you go to the doctor and get prescriptions for to inject.
[00:40:14.665 --> 00:40:16.126]  But you can get it without a prescription.
[00:40:16.706 --> 00:40:20.488]  Other companies just want to sell you stuff that costs 40 cents in the bottle.
[00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:25.631]  This cost us $9, what goes in the bottle.
[00:40:25.891 --> 00:40:27.132]  Yeah, then we sell it for $24.95.
[00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:28.372]  We mark it up 150%.
[00:40:28.412 --> 00:40:33.914]  The average stuff out there has a 6-7% markup, the average stuff.
[00:40:35.134 --> 00:40:35.695]  We don't do that.
[00:40:35.735 --> 00:40:42.277]  We have to fund ourselves, so some things have a 50% markup, 100% markup, 150% markup, because there's marketing, the crew, the whole place to pay for.
[00:40:43.297 --> 00:40:44.117]  It's very expensive.
[00:40:45.398 --> 00:40:47.719]  But our products are game changers.
[00:40:47.899 --> 00:40:50.740]  Well, it's 16% off right now at Infowarslife.com.
[00:40:52.538 --> 00:41:01.326]  And they're game changers because we just bring you the absolute nutraceutical best we can get after doing years of research per product in some cases.
[00:41:01.827 --> 00:41:03.789]  Sometimes it's three, four months research to find the best.
[00:41:04.129 --> 00:41:09.955]  Sometimes it's, well, Grip spent five years trying to get a hold of this and he finally did and gave it to us.
[00:41:10.848 --> 00:41:11.248]  Five years.
[00:41:12.029 --> 00:41:13.490]  And we looked into it, we didn't just believe him.
[00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:15.711]  And we have the industry calling us.
[00:41:15.771 --> 00:41:21.395]  We have billion-dollar, multi-billion-dollar companies contacting, wanting to partner with us right now.
[00:41:21.915 --> 00:41:26.038]  I mean, real blessings are happening because we're doing the right thing.
[00:41:26.118 --> 00:41:27.379]  So praise God for that.
[00:41:28.219 --> 00:41:30.141]  And people say, man, quit praising God all the time.
[00:41:30.161 --> 00:41:30.541]  We're sick of it.
[00:41:30.901 --> 00:41:32.762]  Hey, call it a crutch, whatever you want.
[00:41:33.082 --> 00:41:34.623]  There are no atheists in foxholes.
[00:41:34.663 --> 00:41:38.346]  The deeper I get down this new world order, the more I need to cling to God.
[00:41:40.071 --> 00:41:41.151]  Or I'd crap myself.
[00:41:41.351 --> 00:41:48.574]  I mean, it's so legendary and epic what we're all involved in, all of us, that I hope you realize that.
[00:41:49.114 --> 00:41:53.575]  So I bring it up a lot because we're going into the fiery furnace, we're going out into the arena.
[00:41:53.595 --> 00:41:55.036]  This is it.
[00:41:55.056 --> 00:41:58.377]  We're going into global corporate fascism worldwide right now.
[00:41:58.937 --> 00:41:59.997]  So strap yourselves in.
[00:42:01.398 --> 00:42:05.439]  I gotta tell you, we have the best seaweed-derived
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:07.962]  We're good to go.
[00:42:21.018 --> 00:42:22.579]  That was original Survival Shield.
[00:42:22.719 --> 00:42:23.440]  It was a bestseller.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:38.511]  Then, because we had folks out there trying to do espionage, and this is what happens in business, but a lot of it was governmental-type groups through operatives, and I'm going to go to Wayne Madsen, trying to basically shut down our sources of puriodine, which is DEA-controlled.
[00:42:38.811 --> 00:42:39.712]  It's the good halogen.
[00:42:39.992 --> 00:42:49.319]  It's just so incredible what happens when this gets into your glands, like your thyroid, instead of the bad stuff like all the borine and chlorine and fluoride and the bad halogens.
[00:42:50.976 --> 00:42:58.319]  Then, for the last year and a half, we were able to get X2, that is a pure crystal, 99999, whatever, I mean, it's just, it's almost completely pure.
[00:42:58.579 --> 00:43:02.381]  The stuff we get, you put it out in the air, it turns purple and turns into gas.
[00:43:03.101 --> 00:43:07.823]  It'll eat through concrete like alien blood, you know, from the 1970-something movie.
[00:43:08.984 --> 00:43:12.205]  But it's good once it's in palm oil and in small amounts in your body.
[00:43:12.245 --> 00:43:13.766]  It's just incredible what it does.
[00:43:14.366 --> 00:43:16.347]  You've heard the rave reviews, you've seen the science.
[00:43:18.482 --> 00:43:21.623]  So because they tried to shut us down, we found another source.
[00:43:22.184 --> 00:43:24.925]  The problem is they can only get them out of certain deep wells.
[00:43:25.565 --> 00:43:26.565]  Deep drilling wells.
[00:43:26.666 --> 00:43:31.988]  When they happen to hit it, drilling, you have to deal with oil companies that will give it to you on the side.
[00:43:32.008 --> 00:43:37.230]  A lot of companies just off-gas helium and stuff like that that's super valuable, but they're not going after helium.
[00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:38.891]  They're not going after pure iodine.
[00:43:39.668 --> 00:43:41.930]  So, this is a finite supply.
[00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:44.092]  A, we're running out of it.
[00:43:44.252 --> 00:43:47.735]  B, we are running out of the crystals to manufacture it.
[00:43:47.955 --> 00:43:52.019]  We'll probably get more, but it's something that preserves and saves a long time.
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:59.706]  If you want to get your X2, now is the time, because it might be sold out for a month, might be sold out for five months, might be sold out longer.
[00:44:01.016 --> 00:44:03.438]  I mean, the problem is supply chain, folks.
[00:44:03.978 --> 00:44:10.682]  So, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 will still have original survival shield.
[00:44:11.222 --> 00:44:17.206]  But the X2 that nobody else has got is just over-the-top good.
[00:44:17.246 --> 00:44:17.966]  That's what people go, iodine?
[00:44:17.986 --> 00:44:18.607]  What are you talking about?
[00:44:18.827 --> 00:44:20.148]  This is real iodine, folks.
[00:44:20.448 --> 00:44:21.769]  Not garbage and alcohol.
[00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:23.169]  Not stuff that turns red.
[00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:25.111]  It turns electric purple blue.
[00:44:25.671 --> 00:44:28.132]  Because, go look up iodine crystals online.
[00:44:28.573 --> 00:44:30.254]  They're electric blue purple.
[00:44:30.774 --> 00:44:31.514]  This is real.
[00:44:32.455 --> 00:44:33.095]  This is real.
[00:44:33.596 --> 00:44:34.996]  Consult your physician before you take it.
[00:44:35.016 --> 00:44:35.557]  It's hardcore.
[00:44:35.877 --> 00:44:37.878]  Now, Wayne Madsen will be with us 15 to the next hour.
[00:44:37.898 --> 00:44:40.739]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:46.062]  And I do not know his take, his view on all this yet.
[00:44:46.602 --> 00:44:47.723]  He's got a new report out.
[00:44:47.903 --> 00:44:49.104]  ISIS made the USA.
[00:44:49.144 --> 00:44:50.765]  We'll talk about that in the next hour with him.
[00:44:51.465 --> 00:44:52.706]  We'll talk to him about
[00:44:54.005 --> 00:44:57.728]  The Patriot Act renewal that they're trying to ram through when it expires Sunday.
[00:44:58.849 --> 00:45:01.611]  We'll cover it all with Wayne Madsen today.
[00:45:02.912 --> 00:45:11.039]  But Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist, formerly in the NSA, is the only person I ever heard say that Hastert's compromised.
[00:45:11.399 --> 00:45:12.220]  We have the interview.
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.641]  Somebody should go try to pull those up.
[00:45:14.082 --> 00:45:15.623]  He's just been on so much it's hard to find.
[00:45:16.063 --> 00:45:21.808]  When he, in his investigations into Illinois corruption, Blagojevich and the rest of it said, Hastert's the big one.
[00:45:22.048 --> 00:45:24.350]  We now learn a grand jury indicted him last February.
[00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:29.174]  They waited till now, and he joins us to give us his take on what's happening.
[00:45:29.215 --> 00:45:32.518]  We'll see if he agrees with my analysis, but I'll defer to him.
[00:45:32.578 --> 00:45:37.762]  He's the Hastert expert, former Speaker of the House, indicted yesterday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[00:45:38.022 --> 00:45:39.404]  Wayne Madsen, what do you think's going on?
[00:45:40.305 --> 00:45:40.925]  Hi, Alex.
[00:45:41.005 --> 00:45:45.828]  Well, I reported on Hastert's so-called misconduct.
[00:45:45.848 --> 00:45:46.348]  Hold on just a moment.
[00:45:46.368 --> 00:45:47.288]  We're going to start over.
[00:45:47.308 --> 00:45:48.689]  I'm going to back up with you.
[00:45:48.709 --> 00:45:50.310]  We're going to refocus, reset in there.
[00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:51.630]  Get everything going.
[00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:52.011]  OK?
[00:45:52.031 --> 00:45:54.312]  We're going to go now to Wayne Madsen.
[00:45:54.352 --> 00:45:55.012]  Wayne, go ahead.
[00:45:55.632 --> 00:45:56.293]  OK.
[00:45:56.893 --> 00:46:06.798]  On September 30, 2006, I first reported on my website about this past misconduct of Dennis Hastert.
[00:46:07.577 --> 00:46:13.262]  Remember, he was Speaker of the House, third in line under presidential succession to the presidency.
[00:46:13.842 --> 00:46:21.769]  If I can just read this, because it's very interesting, this background of Hastert and how he got to his position.
[00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:24.971]  What I reported on September 30th, 2006, nine years ago,
[00:46:27.173 --> 00:46:46.077]  Congressional sources told me that Hastert, while working from 1964 to 1980 as a popular history government teacher and wrestling coach at Yorkville High School in Yorkville, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, was the subject of persistent rumors about inappropriate contact with male members of his high school wrestling team.
[00:46:46.437 --> 00:46:50.738]  The culture of the times usually resulted in such alleged behavior being covered up by public
[00:46:51.178 --> 00:46:52.679]  And parochial school authorities.
[00:46:52.699 --> 00:47:01.546]  However, the rumors were enough for his Yorkville constituency to reject him when he ran for an open seat in the Illinois House of Representatives in 1980.
[00:47:02.127 --> 00:47:10.954]  However, Hastert lucked out when another sitting Republican House member who represented the three-seat district had a stroke and declined to run for re-election.
[00:47:10.994 --> 00:47:15.377]  The GOP machine bosses selected Hastert as the replacement candidate.
[00:47:15.658 --> 00:47:17.439]  Hastert served in Springfield from 80 to 86.
[00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:24.985]  Six years to make the transformation from wrestling coach, with that cloud surrounding himself, to politician.
[00:47:25.545 --> 00:47:31.790]  In 1986, Hastert received another unexpected promotion after incumbent Republican U.S.
[00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:38.054]  Representative John Grohberg was nominated by the GOP for a second term.
[00:47:38.074 --> 00:47:41.517]  He was diagnosed with terminal cancer and fell into a coma.
[00:47:41.917 --> 00:47:48.602]  The Illinois Republican Convention selected Hastert as a replacement on the ticket, a virtual election to the U.S.
[00:47:48.622 --> 00:47:50.523]  House in the strongly Republican district.
[00:47:50.823 --> 00:47:55.366]  So that's how Hastert got in to the House of Representatives.
[00:47:56.367 --> 00:48:02.771]  He was rejected because of the rumors surrounding him as a high school wrestling coach.
[00:48:02.971 --> 00:48:09.796]  I heard from people in that particular town, Yorkville, and nearby, that Hastert was caught
[00:48:11.817 --> 00:48:14.097]  I'm just speechless here because nine times out of ten, Wayne,
[00:48:38.843 --> 00:48:44.627]  When I have a guest on like you who's predicted all this, who's broken this info, who had the courage to go with it.
[00:48:45.528 --> 00:48:50.951]  We can't find where you said it, but thank God you wrote about it at WayneMadsenReport.com.
[00:48:50.991 --> 00:48:54.093]  So if we can, please email us that story.
[00:48:54.514 --> 00:48:59.117]  I'd like to flashback, republish it today at InfoWars.com.
[00:48:59.537 --> 00:49:05.841]  And I'd like to ask you to write a piece for us today, tying it all together and then linking back to WayneMadsenReport.com.
[00:49:06.341 --> 00:49:08.563]  Because it's no exaggeration.
[00:49:10.404 --> 00:49:18.808]  50 times or more, you have broken information that is just huge before anybody else does, I guess because you do old-fashioned investigative journalism.
[00:49:19.288 --> 00:49:22.630]  I know when you went to Illinois to investigate, you got some real serious death threats.
[00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:23.970]  You had to leave the U.S.
[00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:25.171]  for about four or five months.
[00:49:25.651 --> 00:49:33.335]  You came back, and I guess the contract that was out on you that you were warned about at the press club was removed.
[00:49:34.015 --> 00:49:35.356]  But let me ask you this question.
[00:49:35.616 --> 00:49:37.217]  How have you stayed alive this long?
[00:49:38.664 --> 00:49:39.545]  I guess I'm lucky.
[00:49:39.565 --> 00:49:43.450]  I have to give you some other anecdotes about Hastert over the years.
[00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:44.531]  These are kind of humorous.
[00:49:44.972 --> 00:49:52.240]  I remember, first of all, when I first reported this about Hastert, this was in the middle of the Mark Foley scandal.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:55.164]  You remember he was the Republican representative from Florida.
[00:49:55.664 --> 00:50:00.908]  Who was caught trying to solicit sex from underage male pages.
[00:50:01.888 --> 00:50:04.710]  Hastert's name also came up in the late 80s.
[00:50:05.531 --> 00:50:12.476]  If you recall, the Washington Times, which is a conservative paper, broke this story about the Franklin cover-up.
[00:50:12.936 --> 00:50:15.778]  And the Midnight Cowboy Underage Ring.
[00:50:16.259 --> 00:50:32.471]  Absolutely, and Hastert's name came up in those rumors, and it's interesting because in 2006 when Hastert's name came up again in the Foley-Pagegate scandal, the Washington Times called for his resignation as House Speaker.
[00:50:32.491 --> 00:50:35.934]  I think they also knew about his background, but
[00:50:36.915 --> 00:50:38.176]  It wasn't just Hastert.
[00:50:38.556 --> 00:50:51.389]  Of course, Hastert was involved in trying to cover things up for Foley and included many, many other members of the House of Representatives, including John Boehner, who's now the Speaker of the House.
[00:50:52.049 --> 00:50:54.870]  And remember how Astor became speaker.
[00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:59.292]  Newt Gingrich resigned amid a scandal.
[00:51:00.092 --> 00:51:02.113]  And then Robert... I'll tell you what, Wayne, stay there.
[00:51:02.193 --> 00:51:02.433]  Stay there.
[00:51:02.453 --> 00:51:04.713]  I want you to slowly walk through this when we come back.
[00:51:05.014 --> 00:51:09.015]  How it's one big nest of compromised individuals in the pedo club.
[00:51:12.025 --> 00:51:16.948]  KDArmor.com is your one-stop shop for the most affordable body armor period.

[00:51:49.445 --> 00:51:50.185]  This capitalism?
[00:51:50.245 --> 00:51:56.348]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:51:56.408 --> 00:52:00.050]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:54:03.693 --> 00:54:04.273]  Watch me!
[00:54:24.051 --> 00:54:24.572]  I got it.
[00:54:25.413 --> 00:54:25.813]  Hey!
[00:54:25.833 --> 00:54:29.437]  I got something that makes me wanna shout.
[00:54:30.038 --> 00:54:31.720]  I got something that...
[00:54:45.344 --> 00:54:57.474]  We just got a copy of the 2006 subscription article from WayneMadsonReport.com and we're going to get a screenshot of the original as well and republish it for everybody at InfoWars.com.
[00:54:58.775 --> 00:55:08.583]  I hope everybody realizes that as we're sitting here listening to Wayne Madson, I don't normally hype stuff up like this because it's not hype, it's no brag, it's just fact.
[00:55:09.184 --> 00:55:11.386]  Do you understand he went to Illinois
[00:55:12.895 --> 00:55:29.831]  He did investigations, he's been there more than seven times, he spent months there, in some cases each time, and he specifically broke the news as an investigative journalist that Dennis Hastert was picked out of a group of compromised pedophiles.
[00:55:30.939 --> 00:55:44.187]  To be brought in out of nowhere and then to be made the Speaker of the House in just a few years, unheard of, because he was compromised, and he's in the same nest as John Boehner, who you wonder why he's so under control.
[00:55:45.488 --> 00:55:48.130]  Because the mafia that runs this country,
[00:55:50.697 --> 00:56:03.024]  He gets these pedophiles, these alleged pedophiles, and I say that with my eyes rolling, and puts them in there to then carry out the agenda because they can be destroyed at any time.
[00:56:03.425 --> 00:56:06.587]  And the bigger issue is, why are they burning him now?
[00:56:07.487 --> 00:56:14.852]  Why have they activated the FBI, who's compartmentalized and probably think they're doing a good job, to go in and do this now?
[00:56:15.742 --> 00:56:33.436]  We're going to make a big deal out of this, because I want Win Madsen to really roll through how this all ties together, and then we're going to put a special report together with his article, and the headline on his article should be, Investigative Journalist Broke Castered Molestation Story in 2006.
[00:56:35.313 --> 00:56:36.114]  Sub-headline.
[00:56:37.716 --> 00:56:41.501]  Politicians controlled via sex crimes.
[00:56:42.302 --> 00:56:43.323]  Connected to Boehner.
[00:56:43.343 --> 00:56:44.404]  I mean, boom!
[00:56:44.925 --> 00:56:50.091]  Because the only way to stop all this is to expose the blackmail ring and how it's operating.
[00:56:50.888 --> 00:57:01.777]  Well, we're going to break in three or four minutes, but try to encapsulate it right now, Wayne, how you investigated it, who the players are, and how it's connected to Boehner, as you were just saying in the last segment.
[00:57:02.537 --> 00:57:06.621]  Well, I investigated the Foley matter.
[00:57:06.661 --> 00:57:16.148]  That was Mark Foley, Republican from Florida, who was actually soliciting sex from underage male pages.
[00:57:16.769 --> 00:57:17.849]  You know, every
[00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:31.121]  Decade give or take a couple of years we had an issue in that mostly in the house but also in the Senate but mostly the house where we had this explosion of scandal about the pages.
[00:57:32.182 --> 00:57:34.523]  At first in the early 1980s
[00:57:37.145 --> 00:57:39.487]  It first raised its ugly head.
[00:57:39.927 --> 00:57:46.750]  One of the people then who was implicated was a representative named Larry Craig, who was then a congressman from Idaho.
[00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:48.811]  Of course, we found out about him later.
[00:57:48.831 --> 00:57:58.676]  In the late 80s, we had the so-called Franklin scandal involving the Franklin Credit Union in Nebraska.
[00:57:59.016 --> 00:58:01.978]  And again, we had midnight tours, as you showed earlier,
[00:58:03.058 --> 00:58:13.500]  Headline from the Washington Times that was worked on by my late colleague Paul Rodriguez and got no attention from the Washington Post.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:21.942]  As a matter of fact, I should point out that my story on Hastert in 2006 was met with derision by the mainstream media then.
[00:58:22.622 --> 00:58:25.783]  I note this morning they're all calling me up now.
[00:58:27.443 --> 00:58:30.325]  For comment and my original sources.
[00:58:31.866 --> 00:58:34.308]  So I think that's kind of... It's huge.
[00:58:34.388 --> 00:58:36.370]  I'm giving you the floor when we come back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:40.652]  I want you to continue to lay out more on how you were saying was connected to Boehner.
[00:58:40.893 --> 00:58:42.454]  It's clear Boehner's being blackmailed.
[00:58:42.514 --> 00:58:45.856]  I mean, he's committing political suicide for the Republicans right now.
[00:58:46.236 --> 00:58:49.018]  He's selling the country out on the TPP, on the borders.
[00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:49.679]  Why?
[00:58:50.219 --> 00:58:50.940]  Well, it's blackmail.
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:52.441]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:00:02.751 --> 01:00:06.773]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:14.156 --> 01:00:16.717]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here live.
[01:00:16.757 --> 01:00:20.579]  We're gonna go ahead and fade down the intro.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.601]  We have such amazing breaking news.
[01:00:24.201 --> 01:00:30.684]  Last night I was downtown having dinner with friends at their condo and
[01:00:32.423 --> 01:00:41.873]  I called Buckley, my cousin, who also lives nearby, and I said, will you come by with the rig, the microphone and iPhone, so we can do a report on Hastert?
[01:00:41.913 --> 01:00:46.358]  I was going to wait until today to cover it, but I decided instead to just do one last night.
[01:00:47.972 --> 01:01:00.856]  And then after I shot the report, or right before I shot the report, I thought, man, Wayne Madsen talked about how it's all a pedophile ring and tied to this wrestling coach who they basically promoted so he'd be compromised.
[01:01:01.597 --> 01:01:02.797]  I need to get Wayne Madsen on.
[01:01:02.837 --> 01:01:06.758]  And of course, he's being called by the media now because Wayne broke all this in his report.
[01:01:08.039 --> 01:01:10.800]  In fact, I have a copy of the report now you just sent me from 2006.
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:14.381]  But what was the title of the report then, Wayne?
[01:01:16.585 --> 01:01:17.305]  I had several.
[01:01:17.706 --> 01:01:23.332]  I had probably about 10 reports from September 30th to October, around October the 10th, 2006.
[01:01:24.073 --> 01:01:30.679]  The first one was major cover-up suspected in GOP's PageGate, now rocking Capitol Hill.
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.501]  Hastert's name was mentioned in that report.
[01:01:34.322 --> 01:01:47.249]  September 7th to 8th, the rumors about another top GOP member of the House being involved in sexual encounters with young men for hire are confirmed to my website by well-placed sources in Washington's gay community.
[01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:49.471]  That was Hastert, by the way.
[01:01:51.266 --> 01:01:52.707]  I don't know.
[01:02:07.546 --> 01:02:07.886]  I don't
[01:02:30.896 --> 01:02:33.157]  It has to do with the page board, the governing body.
[01:02:33.557 --> 01:02:40.640]  You know, the House page board doesn't exist, the House page system doesn't even exist anymore because of the Foley scandal.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:41.421]  They got rid of it.
[01:02:42.581 --> 01:02:44.462]  It still exists in the Senate, however.
[01:02:44.582 --> 01:02:54.787]  So it's basically, as best I can tell, a cult of pedophiles, and that you can't get in unless you're part of it, and they basically, like the Catholic Church, taken it over.
[01:02:55.986 --> 01:02:59.468]  Yeah, there's a couple funny anecdotes.
[01:02:59.528 --> 01:03:00.809]  I mean, it's a serious case.
[01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:11.036]  I remember walking with a friend of mine and we encountered Charlie Rangel back in those days in the Rotunda.
[01:03:11.856 --> 01:03:18.937]  And we, you know, if you're with somebody and they kind of look at something and it's like an inside, they have some inside information.
[01:03:19.197 --> 01:03:26.399]  Well, here comes Hastert walking across the rotunda with a young, very young male page.
[01:03:26.519 --> 01:03:31.420]  Obviously, you see members of Congress with their senior staffers, chief of staff all the time.
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:33.200]  But this was very unusual.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:38.361]  And I noticed a wry smile on Congressman Rangel's face, like he knew something.
[01:03:39.421 --> 01:03:44.046]  And, you know, the neuro-linguistics on that one said everything.
[01:03:44.586 --> 01:03:52.895]  And I actually had the opportunity of running into Hastert after he was speaker at the GOP convention in 2000 in Tampa.
[01:03:53.075 --> 01:03:59.782]  There was kind of a people traffic jam in the arena.
[01:04:00.502 --> 01:04:09.008]  And he was standing right next to me and I looked at him and I said, how's retired life treating you, Mr. Speaker, using the honorific.
[01:04:09.988 --> 01:04:11.890]  I know he was a speaker, but it's the D.C.
[01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:12.290]  thing.
[01:04:13.811 --> 01:04:16.153]  And he said, he said, good.
[01:04:16.233 --> 01:04:19.155]  And then he said, I oh, I forgot your name.
[01:04:19.535 --> 01:04:24.298]  And I told him and the guy turned pale and said, I got to get back to my Illinois delegation.
[01:04:24.698 --> 01:04:29.642]  So clearly he recalled the reports that I had on his misconduct back in 06.
[01:04:30.502 --> 01:04:32.223]  Oh, you're definitely on target.
[01:04:32.463 --> 01:04:34.405]  And Wayne, we talked about this last time you were here.
[01:04:36.066 --> 01:04:36.786]  You agreed to do it.
[01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:37.727]  We never hammered it out.
[01:04:38.187 --> 01:04:38.787]  You're hired.
[01:04:39.267 --> 01:04:40.568]  I want to get you on every week.
[01:04:40.648 --> 01:04:42.129]  I want you writing for InfoWars.
[01:04:42.529 --> 01:04:44.971]  We need to talk details today.
[01:04:45.451 --> 01:04:48.393]  Because, you know, years just go by like seconds, as you know.
[01:04:48.773 --> 01:04:50.354]  And I need you on the InfoWars team.
[01:04:51.855 --> 01:04:53.117]  We're going to get that done, aren't we?
[01:04:53.858 --> 01:04:54.659]  Sure, sure.
[01:04:54.719 --> 01:04:57.842]  Yeah, you're right about years going by, especially at 61.
[01:04:59.484 --> 01:05:01.387]  I feel the rush of the years.
[01:05:01.407 --> 01:05:02.108]  Well, hey, listen.
[01:05:02.188 --> 01:05:03.589]  I mean, I'm no Hastert, so don't worry.
[01:05:03.629 --> 01:05:06.012]  I'm not going to ask you out on a date, but you lost a lot of weight, man.
[01:05:06.052 --> 01:05:06.693]  You're looking good.
[01:05:07.474 --> 01:05:08.435]  Oh, well, I'm trying.
[01:05:08.535 --> 01:05:09.296]  No, no, you're doing great.
[01:05:09.316 --> 01:05:09.577]  Here we go.
[01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:17.477]  Police departments and law enforcement agencies around the world have been using radar devices for a very long time.
[01:05:17.697 --> 01:05:25.322]  But now, new technology is being used that allows police officers to see and detect movement through solid walls.
[01:05:25.762 --> 01:05:31.686]  It requires no warrant for the cops to spy on you, right there in the privacy of your own home.
[01:05:32.006 --> 01:05:35.307]  USA Today is reporting that at least 50 U.S.
[01:05:35.387 --> 01:05:44.471]  law enforcement agencies have secretly equipped their officers with radar devices that allow them to effectively peer through the walls of houses.
[01:05:44.491 --> 01:05:47.753]  And it has been confirmed with the FBI and the U.S.
[01:05:47.833 --> 01:05:50.434]  Marshals Services that both agencies
[01:05:50.754 --> 01:05:54.237]  ...are using this technology without obtaining warrants.
[01:05:54.557 --> 01:05:55.157]  But of course.
[01:05:55.538 --> 01:06:04.525]  And now there is even more advanced technology being introduced with 3D capabilities that are capable of being mounted on drones.
[01:06:04.845 --> 01:06:09.609]  For more reports and today's breaking news, go to InfoWars.com.
[01:06:10.089 --> 01:06:12.532]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:12.732 --> 01:06:13.733]  Check it out today.
[01:06:14.213 --> 01:06:22.402]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none, and that's what you'll find at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:22.602 --> 01:06:30.210]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:32.692]  Or because they're not 100% organic.
[01:06:32.832 --> 01:06:39.298]  Or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:39.439 --> 01:06:50.349]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine, or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder, I believe
[01:06:50.509 --> 01:06:51.049]  We're good.
[01:07:10.049 --> 01:07:11.430]  I want more candy!
[01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:12.130]  I want more baby again!
[01:07:12.331 --> 01:07:12.431]  Mine!
[01:07:12.451 --> 01:07:13.331]  Mine!
[01:07:13.351 --> 01:07:13.471]  Mine!
[01:07:40.009 --> 01:07:40.789]  I think so.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:19.185]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:19.806 --> 01:08:22.828]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.129 --> 01:08:27.372]  Wayne Madsen, incredible investigative journalist, formerly with the National Security Agency.
[01:08:28.013 --> 01:08:30.795]  Whistleblower, testified to the EU Parliament, you name it.
[01:08:31.836 --> 01:08:33.878]  Covered Congress for more than two decades.
[01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:36.051]  I'm very excited.
[01:08:36.091 --> 01:08:37.311]  We've talked about this a couple times.
[01:08:37.351 --> 01:08:37.872]  He's been here.
[01:08:37.912 --> 01:08:39.053]  We've discussed it.
[01:08:39.133 --> 01:08:40.394]  I've just never gotten it done.
[01:08:40.434 --> 01:08:41.334]  We just agreed in there.
[01:08:41.695 --> 01:08:42.736]  I'm hiring Wayne Madsen.
[01:08:42.756 --> 01:08:47.239]  He'll still have WayneMadsenReport.com to be a full-time reporter for InfoWars.com.
[01:08:47.259 --> 01:08:49.320]  I mean, he's one of the best out there.
[01:08:50.141 --> 01:08:51.602]  We finally built this operation.
[01:08:51.862 --> 01:08:52.763]  We're going on cable.
[01:08:52.783 --> 01:08:53.924]  We're going on all the systems.
[01:08:54.224 --> 01:08:56.766]  We're already picked up by a lot of cable and TV systems already.
[01:08:57.186 --> 01:08:59.388]  We're on over 170 AM and FM affiliates.
[01:09:00.028 --> 01:09:04.332]  What I'm doing here at InfoWars.com is building a true media operation.
[01:09:04.972 --> 01:09:11.975]  Yes, I'm the rabble-rouser, I'm the pundit, but I bring you the bombshell guest, the intel, the reporters.
[01:09:12.335 --> 01:09:20.838]  Joe Biggs is going to be on the ground at the Draw Prophet Muhammad demonstration tonight in Phoenix.
[01:09:21.498 --> 01:09:24.899]  So all of that is coming up as well.
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:26.480]  And this is what I need.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:31.222]  Four or five more reporters
[01:09:32.225 --> 01:09:43.927]  A couple of text writers, a couple of guys that can do both, a couple of ladies that can do both, so that we can really cover three or four big stories simultaneously with people on the ground.
[01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:54.289]  But it is your support, spreading the word, and purchasing the products at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, Patriot Apparel.
[01:09:54.329 --> 01:10:00.850]  We've got the new t-shirt, when I saw PacSun got rid of their upside-down American flag as a protest.
[01:10:01.704 --> 01:10:05.788]  Well, we came out with one that says, Save America, upside down flag, with the U.S.
[01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:10.752]  flag code saying when the country's in dire trouble, it's law to fly it upside down.
[01:10:11.272 --> 01:10:14.575]  And on the back it says, Our Republic is in distress.
[01:10:15.216 --> 01:10:15.996]  Ask me why.
[01:10:16.016 --> 01:10:17.518]  Infowars.com.
[01:10:19.482 --> 01:10:22.864]  Great way to start conversations, great way to educate people.
[01:10:22.964 --> 01:10:29.246]  It is a super best-seller t-shirt and we have it available right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:10:29.847 --> 01:10:32.688]  But it's things like that that fund the entire operation.
[01:10:33.368 --> 01:10:36.690]  So thank you for your support and supporting our local AM and FM affiliates.
[01:10:37.290 --> 01:10:38.951]  Okay, if you can, this is so big.
[01:10:39.858 --> 01:10:53.444]  Wayne Madsen wrote, not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, we're in his archives right now, in 2006 about Dennis Hastert and connections to pedophile rings and compromised Congress people.
[01:10:53.764 --> 01:11:04.769]  He's taken from nowhere, put into the House of Representatives, accelerated into Republican leadership that, you know, Ron Paul was there 20-something years and never got put in any leadership.
[01:11:06.752 --> 01:11:09.455]  Put into leadership, and then Boehner was under him.
[01:11:09.975 --> 01:11:18.884]  And Boehner's connected to all this, so I want to specifically recap it, and get into Boehner, and then ask Wayne Madsen before we shift gears into ISIS, the economy, and more.
[01:11:20.005 --> 01:11:29.134]  This signifies trying to scare people in the Republican House to get in line on the TPP, to get in line on a bunch of other issues.
[01:11:31.464 --> 01:11:38.827]  So I want to ask you what you think it signifies and where all this is going with Obama's unprecedented persecution.
[01:11:38.867 --> 01:11:44.770]  I'm not crying for Denny Hastert, but unprecedented persecution of the press and others.
[01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:45.370]  Wayne Madsen.
[01:11:46.283 --> 01:11:54.347]  Well, I mean, we're getting into the 2016 presidential race, so we're going to probably see a lot more of this.
[01:11:54.387 --> 01:12:02.831]  Of course, Hastert's not a candidate, but somebody who basically defended this activity is a candidate.
[01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:09.977]  And I would just cite that at the time that I made these reports in October 2006, the St.
[01:12:10.037 --> 01:12:19.807]  Petersburg Time on October 4th, 2006, it's now the Tampa Bay Times, reported on the knowledge of top Florida Republicans, including then Governor Jeb Bush,
[01:12:20.367 --> 01:12:26.171]  And Attorney General Charlie Crist, who was then a Republican, about the Foley-Hastert scandal in Washington.
[01:12:26.332 --> 01:12:27.652]  And this is a quote from the St.
[01:12:27.733 --> 01:12:28.413]  Pete Times.
[01:12:28.833 --> 01:12:44.185]  In a gaggle with Florida's Capitol Press Corps Wednesday, Governor Jeb Bush flatly refused allegations posted on an internet website and circulated widely Tuesday that claims Bush, Attorney General Charlie Crist, and Florida Department of Law Enforcement were all told
[01:12:44.645 --> 01:12:49.448]  By the Federal Justice Department about Mark Foley's emails a year ago but covered it up.
[01:12:49.528 --> 01:12:57.472]  The alleged conspiracy source to inform sources in Tallahassee who were not named was reported on the Wayne Madsen Report website.
[01:12:57.512 --> 01:13:04.897]  Madsen's website claims to tackle the politically incorrect and politically embarrassing stories and holds government officials accountable for their actions.
[01:13:05.297 --> 01:13:08.899]  Bush responded to a question from the St.
[01:13:08.939 --> 01:13:09.940]  Pete Times reporter
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:31.706]  In Tallahassee about my report and he said if the next governor, referring to Charlie Crist who was running for the seat, is going to have to respond to every blog and every tired little anonymous person who has some bitter part in their soul who wants to express it on the internet, it's not going to work.
[01:13:32.515 --> 01:13:33.015]  Unquote.
[01:13:33.975 --> 01:13:41.798]  That was now presidential candidate Jeb Bush's comment on the Hastert-Foley scandal at the time.
[01:13:42.218 --> 01:13:44.059]  Why was he interested in covering it up?
[01:13:46.399 --> 01:13:51.801]  Well, that's the word, that going back, that it wasn't Reagan that had the cowboys in there, that it was...
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:14:00.347]  That it was George Herbert Walker Bush, and that it goes all the way back to that, and that's what the Washington Times reported.
[01:14:00.967 --> 01:14:01.468]  Hundreds!
[01:14:01.688 --> 01:14:02.489]  Wasn't it hundreds?
[01:14:02.769 --> 01:14:06.452]  In fact, we can pull the news article up, the scan of it, of the Washington Times.
[01:14:06.773 --> 01:14:10.716]  Wasn't it hundreds of times underage cowboys were visiting after midnight?
[01:14:11.517 --> 01:14:27.488]  Well, there were reports that Bush was seeing at these get-togethers in Nebraska where they would fly, in some cases, either fly child prostitutes in or get them out of Boys Town, the Roman Catholic famous orphanage outside of Omaha.
[01:14:27.688 --> 01:14:30.670]  Well, it also ties in, doesn't it, Wayne, to Penn State.
[01:14:30.690 --> 01:14:41.359]  I mean, we know Sandusky is in there raping people from this troubled youth group at high noon on Saturdays.
[01:14:41.419 --> 01:14:44.462]  I mean, a field house on the weekend is a busy place.
[01:14:45.202 --> 01:14:47.744]  He certainly felt like he was safe.
[01:14:47.845 --> 01:14:48.865]  So here's the other question.
[01:14:49.546 --> 01:14:55.411]  Why are they now busting people when they've been good, helpful servants of Soron?
[01:14:57.045 --> 01:15:00.307]  Well, you know, I mean, it's the nature of Washington.
[01:15:00.948 --> 01:15:04.090]  That place will eat their own alive.
[01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:14.056]  And, you know, it's just, it's getting worse and worse there because, one thing about the Congress, they used to have statesmen.
[01:15:14.096 --> 01:15:22.042]  The worst thing you would catch them on is getting drunk in public or messing around with a prostitute of the opposite sex.
[01:15:22.082 --> 01:15:25.364]  I'm thinking, you know, Wilbur Mills and Wayne Hayes.
[01:15:27.265 --> 01:15:36.328]  People like that, but nowadays it's getting into more of the illegal aspects, which is underage sex.
[01:15:36.448 --> 01:15:42.970]  But is that because it's a club, and just like in the mafia or street gangs, you've got to commit some horrible crime?
[01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:46.532]  Uh, that people have to prove themselves and be compromised.
[01:15:46.552 --> 01:15:49.113]  Isn't that classic criminal psychology?
[01:15:49.513 --> 01:15:52.715]  Oh, I think it's a blackmail operation from the word go.
[01:15:52.775 --> 01:15:54.796]  Look at, I mean, look at some of these people.
[01:15:54.836 --> 01:15:58.838]  We have David Vitter, a senator from Louisiana, now running for governor.
[01:15:58.898 --> 01:16:00.619]  I mean, he was paying prostitutes.
[01:16:01.399 --> 01:16:06.381]  Uh, he would soil his diaper and then they would, uh, scold him and spank him and have to clean him up.
[01:16:06.581 --> 01:16:06.822]  I mean,
[01:16:07.722 --> 01:16:12.464]  You know, what is the matter with a state that would elect an individual like that to be their U.S.
[01:16:12.504 --> 01:16:12.684]  Senator?
[01:16:12.724 --> 01:16:13.884]  And it keeps coming out.
[01:16:14.344 --> 01:16:16.965]  What about the Senator Lindsey Graham?
[01:16:16.985 --> 01:16:21.847]  I mean, I've got it from a lot of Washington sources that he's really compromised.
[01:16:22.447 --> 01:16:23.327]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:16:23.407 --> 01:16:32.210]  And I mean, I've said for a long time the GOP nowadays stands for, you know, gray old perverts.
[01:16:34.171 --> 01:16:50.799]  And of course, I've had people from the major newspaper in South Carolina, which is the state out of the capital, Columbia, say, why isn't anyone in Washington reporting on our pretty well-known gay senator, Lindsey Graham, who, by the way, publicly is anti-gay rights?
[01:16:51.219 --> 01:16:52.920]  But how many times have we seen that?
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:55.541]  Those who proclaim this the loudest.
[01:16:56.742 --> 01:17:05.229]  I mean, Rick Santorum, who announced the other day for the presidency, once again, he was a good friend of Jerry Sandusky at Penn State.
[01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:12.656]  And then, of course, you know, they all run from these guys after they get caught, as I'm sure many of them are saying about Hastert.
[01:17:12.676 --> 01:17:13.817]  They're saying, Dennis, who?
[01:17:14.617 --> 01:17:17.020]  The amazing thing is, Hastert was third in line
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:34.725]  uh... for the presidency so think back to 9-11 and uh... you know uh... although we know that was an inside operation but what if uh... what if Bush had been uh... harmed that day and Cheney became president and that would have made Hastert second in line for the presidency.
[01:17:35.065 --> 01:17:40.107]  That's pretty scary to know that somebody that blackmailed uh... could have wound up in that situation.
[01:17:40.147 --> 01:17:44.568]  Sure, but I mean looking at Sandusky, looking at Hastert, it's not that they were fat.
[01:17:44.668 --> 01:17:45.689]  I mean everybody can get fat.
[01:17:45.729 --> 01:17:46.329]  I've been overweight.
[01:17:47.209 --> 01:17:49.090]  They look like something's wrong with them.
[01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:51.251]  I mean, I wouldn't buy a car from them.
[01:17:51.672 --> 01:17:52.972]  I wouldn't associate with them.
[01:17:53.313 --> 01:17:55.034]  They look like deranged scum.
[01:17:55.654 --> 01:17:57.395]  And people say, don't judge a book by its cover.
[01:17:58.716 --> 01:17:58.936]  No.
[01:17:59.096 --> 01:18:05.299]  I mean, quite frankly, you can judge people generally by looking them in the eye, shaking their hand, listening to them, and seeing how they act.
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.301]  I look at the Republican leadership and the Democratic leadership.
[01:18:08.581 --> 01:18:10.442]  They look like a bunch of perverts.
[01:18:10.843 --> 01:18:14.325]  They look like a bunch of Jeffrey Dahmers.
[01:18:14.345 --> 01:18:15.005]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:18:15.045 --> 01:18:16.166]  They look like a bunch of scum.
[01:18:16.952 --> 01:18:17.552]  Right, right.
[01:18:17.632 --> 01:18:33.842]  And I mean, we're talking about Republicans, but I'm still not satisfied that Harry Reid damn near put his eye out as a result of an accident with his weight machine or treadmill or whatever it was.
[01:18:34.362 --> 01:18:35.603]  That defies logic.
[01:18:35.683 --> 01:18:39.645]  What about Bush that kept getting beaten up and he had double black eyes and bloody lips?
[01:18:39.966 --> 01:18:40.906]  He'd say he fell down.
[01:18:40.926 --> 01:18:41.707]  I mean, that's not true.
[01:18:42.387 --> 01:18:52.690]  The one time he had the mark on his cheek, he choked on a pretzel, he said, but I heard he was very, very drunk that day.
[01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:54.691]  He was watching some football and passed out.
[01:18:56.031 --> 01:19:07.434]  So, again, for those viewers and listeners who think Washington is a den of iniquity, I can tell you, tell them all it is.
[01:19:07.515 --> 01:19:08.795]  I've seen it firsthand.
[01:19:11.647 --> 01:19:13.068]  Why did they kill the DC Madam?
[01:19:13.088 --> 01:19:15.510]  I mean, I know you knew her well, you helped get her on the show.
[01:19:16.471 --> 01:19:17.032]  What happened there?
[01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:19.834]  I mean, she wasn't talking, or were they just getting rid of loose ends?
[01:19:20.294 --> 01:19:22.276]  Well, she had some more information.
[01:19:22.336 --> 01:19:24.518]  She had documents she was about ready to release.
[01:19:24.558 --> 01:19:26.419]  We don't know what happened to that, by the way.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.042]  She was seen removing a box of documents.
[01:19:29.642 --> 01:19:36.206]  From a condo in Orlando and taking it to her mother's home in Tarpon Springs in Tampa Bay, Florida.
[01:19:36.326 --> 01:19:37.687]  And we don't know what happened to that.
[01:19:37.727 --> 01:19:42.870]  But she had, there were other shoes that were going to drop in that matter.
[01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:46.093]  I know she was trying to get out of the U.S.
[01:19:46.133 --> 01:19:48.914]  and move to what was formerly East Berlin.
[01:19:49.275 --> 01:19:50.675]  She bought an apartment over there.
[01:19:50.715 --> 01:19:52.637]  I think for her it was a safe house.
[01:19:53.497 --> 01:20:00.563]  Uh, and I think it was a former CIA safe house because of the work she had done as a madam for the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:20:00.703 --> 01:20:01.283]  Absolutely.
[01:20:01.343 --> 01:20:05.426]  She was probably with the Central Intelligence Agency officially, undoubtedly unofficially.
[01:20:05.446 --> 01:20:07.748]  So this is how they treat their own yet again.
[01:20:07.908 --> 01:20:08.409]  We'll be back.
[01:20:10.532 --> 01:20:15.196]  Are you tired of being cyber-raped by big government and big business?
[01:20:15.536 --> 01:20:21.680]  Are you tired of being forced to cough up information, private, personal information, against your will?
[01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:24.522]  Well, I found the answer to their invasive behaviors.
[01:20:24.803 --> 01:20:25.964]  It's called D-vasive.
[01:20:26.044 --> 01:20:27.985]  D- or D-vasive.
[01:20:28.465 --> 01:20:30.387]  It's made for PCs and Androids.
[01:20:30.767 --> 01:20:32.648]  Go get it now at the Google Play Store.
[01:20:32.689 --> 01:20:34.210]  D-vasive.
[01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:34.830]  D-vasive.
[01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.811]  D-vasive.
[01:20:35.891 --> 01:20:36.471]  It's an app.
[01:20:36.571 --> 01:20:39.754]  Get it now and turn Big Brother off.
[01:20:40.274 --> 01:20:41.354]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:41.514 --> 01:20:45.836]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:20:46.016 --> 01:20:51.578]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:20:51.698 --> 01:20:55.099]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:55.259 --> 01:20:57.860]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:24.252]  If food became unavailable, would you be able to feed yourself and your family?
[01:21:24.572 --> 01:21:32.297]  Have you checked and found emergency food can cost as much as $300 for a month's supply and is full of weird chemicals and other unpronounceable ingredients?

[01:23:08.675 --> 01:23:13.737]  Yuvia needed financing to grow her restaurant business, but her bank simply didn't understand.
[01:23:14.177 --> 01:23:15.357]  I was frustrated.
[01:23:15.437 --> 01:23:17.978]  Yuvia found On Deck Business Loans.
[01:23:18.358 --> 01:23:19.479]  On Deck did it for me.
[01:23:19.739 --> 01:23:24.901]  I called on Saturday and I had $50,000 in my account on Monday morning.
[01:23:25.081 --> 01:23:26.001]  How about the terms?
[01:23:26.161 --> 01:23:27.021]  Incredibly easy.
[01:23:27.081 --> 01:23:28.742]  It doesn't mess with your cash flow.
[01:23:28.962 --> 01:23:30.503]  On Deck changed everything.
[01:23:30.523 --> 01:23:32.884]  This company, On Deck, is going to be there for me.
[01:23:32.944 --> 01:23:33.784]  Was it a good move?
[01:23:34.004 --> 01:23:36.265]  I'm looking to increase sales probably 30%.
[01:23:37.225 --> 01:23:40.486]  Been in business for at least a year with $100,000 plus in revenue?
[01:23:40.806 --> 01:23:46.288]  On Deck can get you $5,000 to $250,000 in as little as one business day.
[01:23:46.508 --> 01:23:48.988]  And they're A-plus rated with the Better Business Bureau.
[01:23:49.008 --> 01:23:51.849]  On Deck has opened up so many doors for me now.
[01:23:51.989 --> 01:23:53.750]  Truly, truly, the sky's the limit.
[01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:55.090]  I'm excited.

[01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:46.154]  Wayne Madsen is our guest until about 45 after WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:24:46.214 --> 01:24:48.918]  You can find his books there, e-books and in print.
[01:24:49.939 --> 01:24:52.722]  The classic investigative journalist, the real deal.
[01:24:54.013 --> 01:24:59.657]  I want to move out of the whole blackmail system unless she's got other points she wants to add and get into ISIS.
[01:25:00.298 --> 01:25:05.602]  It's so transparent that ISIS is Western funded and being protected and I see these headlines.
[01:25:06.723 --> 01:25:09.084]  Pentagon is tweaking their ISIS strategy.
[01:25:09.144 --> 01:25:10.305]  They don't know what to do.
[01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:16.290]  It's a Saudi Arabian proxy army taking over.
[01:25:17.674 --> 01:25:20.255]  The Iraqi government has testimony and video.
[01:25:20.335 --> 01:25:22.415]  I mean, we knew it before it even happened.
[01:25:22.455 --> 01:25:24.956]  We said they were going to change the name to confuse the public.
[01:25:25.376 --> 01:25:27.937]  Then I want to get into just other general areas.
[01:25:27.957 --> 01:25:37.100]  But before we do that, Wayne, you were talking about the climate getting crazier, the self-destructiveness, the starting stuff with China, the starting stuff with Russia.
[01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:44.542]  Nobody's lionizing those countries, but it seems like the elite really are bravado, chutzpah-driven.
[01:25:45.484 --> 01:25:50.828]  And it really is scary, you know, covering D.C., being up in D.C., off and on between Florida.
[01:25:51.649 --> 01:25:52.669]  What is the climate?
[01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:57.093]  Where do you expect Obama to go in his last year and a half in office?
[01:25:57.953 --> 01:26:00.515]  The executive power grabs, I mean, all of it.
[01:26:00.535 --> 01:26:06.460]  The Republicans rolling over to everything, but still being indicted.
[01:26:08.181 --> 01:26:10.243]  What are the Democrats thinking and who's in charge?
[01:26:11.263 --> 01:26:18.067]  Well, I think Obama would like to speed up the clock and be out of office a lot sooner.
[01:26:19.068 --> 01:26:28.894]  I noticed he was pretty listless when he spoke yesterday at the National Hurricane Center in Miami about everybody getting prepared for the hurricane season.
[01:26:30.315 --> 01:26:37.140]  I just had the impression he seemed like he wanted to be somewhere else, anywhere but at the National Hurricane.
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:45.505]  Senator telling Americans to how to go and access ready.com or ready.gov or whatever the website is.
[01:26:46.486 --> 01:26:58.134]  I think he's, and he's like other presidents, he's looking at his post presidency that the museum and library are going to be in South Chicago with apparently a satellite facility in Hawaii.
[01:26:58.194 --> 01:27:01.616]  He'll have his new money laundering operation foundation like the Clintons.
[01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:03.177]  Or the Obama Foundation.
[01:27:04.978 --> 01:27:08.881]  I would hope he won't be as crooked as the Clintons have been with that.
[01:27:09.021 --> 01:27:15.605]  I mean, shaking down countries and companies for donations and then steering U.S.
[01:27:15.665 --> 01:27:20.528]  policy towards their favorite projects, which apparently is what Hillary was doing.
[01:27:20.808 --> 01:27:28.011]  I mean, she's cut and dry having third world dictators give her money so she allows the State Department to authorize weapons transfers.
[01:27:28.351 --> 01:27:30.652]  This is the most criminal stuff you can imagine.
[01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:36.815]  Meanwhile, they're busting Hastert for covering up some wrestler, you know, high school wrestler he buggered.
[01:27:37.395 --> 01:27:42.297]  Well, you know, they ought to bust all of them, in my opinion.
[01:27:43.138 --> 01:27:48.660]  There's very few in Washington who... Oh, I agree, bust them all, but how does Hillary get away with it?
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:50.961]  I mean, because they love her.
[01:27:52.262 --> 01:27:53.582]  Look how they extol her.
[01:27:53.682 --> 01:27:54.483]  I mean, she's got...
[01:27:55.003 --> 01:28:03.028]  She's got two challengers for the Democratic nomination who don't get any press attention, hardly.
[01:28:03.168 --> 01:28:07.471]  And when they do, it's sort of like, oh, these guys are also rants.
[01:28:07.812 --> 01:28:11.974]  Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley from Maryland.
[01:28:12.054 --> 01:28:14.816]  But this is how the media operates.
[01:28:15.136 --> 01:28:24.683]  You know, when I broke that Hastert story, I commented on that because back in 06, Anna Marie Cox, who was then Wonkette, if you recall that.
[01:28:25.183 --> 01:28:25.944]  That blog.
[01:28:27.064 --> 01:28:29.165]  This was her comment on my report on Hastert.
[01:28:29.205 --> 01:28:33.608]  She said the problem is Wayne Madsen just makes s-word up.
[01:28:35.168 --> 01:28:39.451]  We hear from well-placed sources that no one is having sex with Dennis Hastert.
[01:28:40.972 --> 01:28:43.833]  I hope Ms.
[01:28:43.873 --> 01:28:50.016]  Cox likes her crow, even though it's served as a cold dish now.
[01:28:54.019 --> 01:28:55.579]  I'm only as good as my sources.
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:23.656]  Not only were the sources, people who knew about Hastert in Northern Illinois, in the Chicago area, but members of the gay community in Washington were very open about this guy and what a, you know, what a basically a hypocrite he was, you know, supporting anti-gay rights, you know, moves by the House, yet everyone knew that his own secret life he... Sure, and you can tell body language, you've seen him prancing around with his boyfriend.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:27.561]  Yeah, that was one where you had to be there.
[01:29:27.581 --> 01:29:29.982]  It was myself, my colleague, and Charlie Rangel.
[01:29:30.282 --> 01:29:37.284]  We just thought that was so odd that here is the Speaker of the House with a very, very young page.
[01:29:37.384 --> 01:29:44.787]  Normally, those guys are back in the office working, and he's acting like it's his Chief of Staff, his closest assistant.
[01:29:44.907 --> 01:29:52.029]  And as I say, even Charlie Rangel looked over at that and had that wry smile like, yeah, there he goes again.
[01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:53.150]  Unbelievable.
[01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:57.513]  We're gonna be back and get into ISIS, get into geopolitics and more with Wayne Madsen.
[01:29:57.553 --> 01:29:58.354]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:58.374 --> 01:29:58.935]  Stay with us.
[01:29:59.655 --> 01:30:00.556]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.056 --> 01:30:02.658]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.599 --> 01:30:06.261]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:17.628]  The Pentagon admits it accidentally sent a shipment of live anthrax to as many as nine laboratories in the U.S.
[01:30:17.808 --> 01:30:19.310]  as well as a lab overseas.
[01:30:19.611 --> 01:30:25.858]  A CDC investigation of this mistake is underway and at the time there is no known risk to the general public.
[01:30:26.238 --> 01:30:37.164]  The anthrax samples were shipped from an army facility in Utah to government and commercial labs in Texas, Maryland, Wisconsin, Delaware, New Jersey, Tennessee, New York, California, and Virginia.
[01:30:37.484 --> 01:30:45.428]  The labs were working as part of a Pentagon effort to develop a new diagnostic test to identify biological threats in the environment.
[01:30:45.808 --> 01:30:52.932]  Dead or inactivated agents were expected, but one lab reports being able to grow live Bacillus anthraxus.
[01:30:53.192 --> 01:30:59.795]  The safety failure comes on the heels of increased scrutiny of bioterror agents and their oversight around the country.
[01:31:00.075 --> 01:31:06.918]  Last June, more than 80 people may have been exposed to live anthrax when a CDC lab sent it by mistake.
[01:31:07.298 --> 01:31:09.799]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[01:31:10.330 --> 01:31:11.530]  Another major health threat.
[01:31:11.570 --> 01:31:16.471]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:31:16.551 --> 01:31:19.192]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:31:19.212 --> 01:31:25.994]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:31:26.274 --> 01:31:29.134]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:31:29.254 --> 01:31:32.175]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:31:32.195 --> 01:31:34.195]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:31:34.235 --> 01:31:37.076]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:31:37.176 --> 01:31:42.659]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:31:42.879 --> 01:31:46.361]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:31:46.381 --> 01:31:49.382]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:31:49.482 --> 01:31:56.586]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:32:10.113 --> 01:32:26.544]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[01:32:26.784 --> 01:32:30.286]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[01:32:30.626 --> 01:32:34.288]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:32:34.528 --> 01:32:35.949]  Hdfirearms.com.
[01:32:36.209 --> 01:32:39.431]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[01:32:39.551 --> 01:32:44.433]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[01:32:44.653 --> 01:32:48.395]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[01:32:48.595 --> 01:32:50.896]  Go to their website, hdfirearms.com.

[01:33:03.103 --> 01:33:07.486]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[01:33:07.766 --> 01:33:08.746]  HDFirearms.com.
[01:33:08.846 --> 01:33:19.293]  You want answers?
[01:33:19.853 --> 01:33:20.974]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:21.674 --> 01:33:26.437]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.331 --> 01:33:29.832]  I believe you can handle the truth.
[01:33:30.713 --> 01:33:32.674]  People ask me all the time, why do you fearmonger?
[01:33:32.694 --> 01:33:33.595]  Why do you want to scare people?
[01:33:35.416 --> 01:33:37.457]  Well, I guess everything is from your perspective.
[01:33:37.998 --> 01:33:39.118]  We all have different perspectives.
[01:33:39.198 --> 01:33:53.108]  We all see through different rose-colored darklies, as the Bible says, but I see a bunch of criminals taking over and being above the law and robbing the country and openly getting the Supreme Court to rule.
[01:33:53.128 --> 01:33:57.651]  They can start taking private pension funds and I see the very same banks doing it in every country they run.
[01:33:58.894 --> 01:34:00.216]  I'm here raising the alarm!
[01:34:01.598 --> 01:34:03.140]  I don't think of that as exceptional.
[01:34:05.123 --> 01:34:07.467]  But I guess it is, and I think that's why we're in so much trouble.
[01:34:08.047 --> 01:34:15.158]  It's exceptional that Wayne Madsen's broken so many big stories, I can't even count them.
[01:34:17.008 --> 01:34:22.052]  And what's even more exceptional is that you hardly ever hear about it in the mainstream media.
[01:34:22.292 --> 01:34:26.676]  There's some comments today going, yeah, Wayne Madsen said this in some major newspapers.
[01:34:27.296 --> 01:34:28.377]  Where are the apologies?
[01:34:29.018 --> 01:34:37.325]  Where are the apologies that I had guessed on whistleblowers, like Springman, about the CIA ordering known terrorists into the country before 9-11?
[01:34:39.066 --> 01:34:40.607]  And ordering the FBI to stand down.
[01:34:42.509 --> 01:34:44.611]  That's now in the 28 pages, it's now admitted.
[01:34:45.543 --> 01:34:48.164]  Where are the apologies from Glenn Beck and Fox News and all of them?
[01:34:49.284 --> 01:34:50.004]  They're never going to come.
[01:34:50.104 --> 01:34:56.526]  And it's not about me, it's not about Wayne Madsen, but it is about the truth and how it triumphs.
[01:34:58.266 --> 01:35:14.110]  And I know Wayne, because I know him well, he's a really good guy, even though he's not bragging, I'd imagine he's savoring, not on a power trip, but just savoring the fact that the truth outs, the truth ends up always surfacing, and that after all he's gone through.
[01:35:15.106 --> 01:35:22.388]  Turning down bigger jobs, money, being harassed, death-threatened, demonized, attacked, that more and more what he's written about is coming true.
[01:35:22.428 --> 01:35:23.829]  It's very exciting.
[01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:32.271]  You can see clips, a compilation with links to his website, his news site, WayneMadsenReport.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:35:33.492 --> 01:35:34.112]  Flashback!
[01:35:34.532 --> 01:35:40.534]  Investigative journalist broke key speaker, Hastert, blackmail sex scandal.
[01:35:42.273 --> 01:35:48.457]  In 2006, again, investigative journalist broke ex-Speaker Hastert Blackmail scandal in 2006.
[01:35:50.639 --> 01:35:55.822]  In 2006, Hastert was involved with a cover-up of a major sex scandal involving Republican congressmen.
[01:35:56.443 --> 01:36:04.508]  And I see a few commenters on YouTube and InfoWars saying, why do we care about some old corrupt weirdo?
[01:36:04.869 --> 01:36:07.630]  I'm glad he's been indicted, and this isn't even a story.
[01:36:08.091 --> 01:36:08.731]  Who cares?
[01:36:08.811 --> 01:36:09.532]  Arrest them all!
[01:36:11.010 --> 01:36:13.491]  It isn't about this molding piece of cheese.
[01:36:14.712 --> 01:36:18.454]  It's about the fact that they selectively are doing it.
[01:36:18.894 --> 01:36:20.075]  Why are they doing it?
[01:36:20.495 --> 01:36:21.716]  What does it signify?
[01:36:21.736 --> 01:36:26.078]  And does it mean they're about to roll up Boehner and the rest of these guys?
[01:36:26.658 --> 01:36:29.940]  This could be a coup against who's left the Republican Party.
[01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:33.782]  And the Republicans could start striking back with all their dirt.
[01:36:36.266 --> 01:36:40.390]  This, I think, signifies a major war going on behind the scenes.
[01:36:40.710 --> 01:36:41.871]  That's what it generally does.
[01:36:42.852 --> 01:36:45.034]  And it just adds to this whole season of craziness.
[01:36:45.534 --> 01:36:46.615]  I want to close the book on this.
[01:36:46.635 --> 01:36:55.303]  Again, there's some other big stories you're working on, Wayne, but in your gut, your sources, am I onto something here, or what do you think this signifies, or is it...
[01:36:56.673 --> 01:36:58.575]  Rogue FBI agents doing their job.
[01:36:58.595 --> 01:37:00.196]  What do you think is happening?
[01:37:00.616 --> 01:37:02.217]  This isn't over yet, Alex.
[01:37:02.558 --> 01:37:12.085]  I would be remiss if I didn't add that among the House leadership at the outset of this House Page scandal are three current U.S.
[01:37:12.125 --> 01:37:12.646]  Senators.
[01:37:14.307 --> 01:37:16.309]  Two of them were members of the House at the time.
[01:37:16.849 --> 01:37:19.211]  Roy Blunt, who's now a Senator from Missouri.
[01:37:19.571 --> 01:37:22.934]  Shelley Moore Capito, who's now a Senator from West Virginia.
[01:37:23.414 --> 01:37:36.421]  And the tutor of the House pages, the tutor, the person in charge of the security of these pages, who apparently was either asleep on the job, or knew what was going on and looked the other way, is now a U.S.
[01:37:36.461 --> 01:37:39.582]  Senator from the state of Nebraska, Ben Sasse.
[01:37:39.803 --> 01:37:43.925]  You gotta be careful how you say that, because it sounds like Ben's ass, if you're not
[01:37:46.258 --> 01:37:51.683]  So it sounds like whoever runs the stable of these pages ends up getting a lot of power real quick.
[01:37:52.284 --> 01:37:53.625]  Great, you mentioned that.
[01:37:53.665 --> 01:37:54.406]  The stabling.
[01:37:54.806 --> 01:38:05.996]  That was another thing that I reported on back then, that because the senators have larger staffs, they would bring in a lot of young male staffers and stable them.
[01:38:06.036 --> 01:38:08.238]  That was the word that was used at the time.
[01:38:08.338 --> 01:38:11.842]  Stable them there, where they would then be able to be farmed out.
[01:38:12.402 --> 01:38:13.883]  Over to the House side.
[01:38:14.264 --> 01:38:18.126]  In other words, I guess the Senators would go over and look and see which one they like.
[01:38:18.166 --> 01:38:20.308]  Yeah, it's like going to a whorehouse and picking which one you want.
[01:38:20.668 --> 01:38:29.595]  Three Senators who were mentioned to me in respect to that were George Allen from Virginia, Rick Santorum from Pennsylvania, and Jim Talent from Missouri.
[01:38:29.915 --> 01:38:30.495]  Unbelievable.
[01:38:30.736 --> 01:38:32.417]  None of them are in the Senate any longer.
[01:38:33.738 --> 01:38:35.819]  Why has this story kind of cooled off?
[01:38:35.919 --> 01:38:36.380]  Cover up?
[01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:39.202]  Because, you know, the Catholic Church thing just keeps coming out.
[01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:43.112]  Is every major institution infested with pedos?
[01:38:44.273 --> 01:38:49.897]  Well look, you know, my first experience with them was when I was with the Navy in 1982.
[01:38:49.977 --> 01:39:01.705]  I was the operations officer at a classified Navy facility in Oregon, and the FBI and NCIS, which is now NCIS, it was NIS at the time, came to me.
[01:39:02.606 --> 01:39:03.487]  I don't know.
[01:39:19.085 --> 01:39:25.854]  There were admirals involved, and then of course, later in the 80s, we found out how high up it went.
[01:39:25.974 --> 01:39:34.485]  Right to the White House, which is what one of the original FBI agents told me at the time, when we were doing a post-mortem on that investigation.
[01:39:34.525 --> 01:39:36.667]  He says, you know this thing goes all the way to the White House.
[01:39:37.088 --> 01:39:37.709]  I was shocked.
[01:39:39.468 --> 01:39:43.591]  I talk a lot about this with Joel Scalzi and other people, light side, dark side, and government.
[01:39:43.611 --> 01:39:48.594]  Government's not our enemy, but it is filled with cliques of bad guys, cliques of good people.
[01:39:49.014 --> 01:39:51.096]  Percentage-wise, you've been around the block.
[01:39:52.242 --> 01:39:56.106]  Is the government more corrupt or less corrupt, or do we just know more now and it's the same?
[01:39:56.787 --> 01:39:57.928]  And take the FBI.
[01:39:57.948 --> 01:40:04.234]  I mean, sometimes the FBI does great things, sometimes it does bad things, sometimes it's political, sometimes it's not, does it depend on the division?
[01:40:05.015 --> 01:40:07.157]  Basically, what's the lay of the land from your research?
[01:40:07.497 --> 01:40:09.179]  How many of these people are good, how many are bad?
[01:40:09.739 --> 01:40:15.102]  I think it's getting worse because in the old days, what was the worst they would get a member of Congress on?
[01:40:15.142 --> 01:40:16.943]  Well, bribes, taking money.
[01:40:17.624 --> 01:40:20.606]  You know, remember Adam Clayton Powell and people like that?
[01:40:20.746 --> 01:40:26.629]  I mean, they were actually good congressmen for their districts, but they, you know, had sticky fingers when it came to money.
[01:40:26.669 --> 01:40:30.472]  Well, of course, that's bad, taking money, taking bribes.
[01:40:30.792 --> 01:40:33.894]  But now we're into the, you know, this really bizarre stuff.
[01:40:34.814 --> 01:40:38.676]  I mentioned Vitter with the diaper, they call him Diaper Dave.
[01:40:38.756 --> 01:40:52.803]  And you know, now there's stuff with Hastert and Foley and Larry Craig, Mr. White's stance at the Minneapolis men's room stall, being arrested by an undercover vice cop.
[01:40:53.803 --> 01:41:04.589]  You know, this stuff started in the early days with Bob Bauman, the Republican conservative congressman from Maryland who was arrested in a men's room, and it's just gotten worse since.
[01:41:05.550 --> 01:41:15.695]  I'm not saying that they didn't have things like this happen in the past, but it certainly was not reported by the press if it was going on.
[01:41:15.735 --> 01:41:16.536]  But I think it's more.
[01:41:16.816 --> 01:41:19.638]  There's more of this going on now, from my vantage point.
[01:41:20.538 --> 01:41:30.662]  Well, the issue I notice is, the more fairy-like a congressman is, the more anti-gay they are, and then they get busted, you know, out in the bathroom.
[01:41:31.283 --> 01:41:39.206]  And I'm not bashing anybody, I'm just using that term because they act effeminate, they act like the classic thing where you'd be in a grocery store and say, hey, I bet that guy's gay over there.
[01:41:40.387 --> 01:41:42.007]  But then, that's their right.
[01:41:42.147 --> 01:41:45.429]  Then it graduates into really deviant criminal stuff.
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:47.442]  And I just don't get it.
[01:41:48.543 --> 01:41:52.269]  I just don't understand it, but then I guess that's who gravitates to our power.
[01:41:52.689 --> 01:42:02.023]  What percentage, and I've asked this of a lot of people in Washington, what percentage are gay versus pedophiles versus heterosexual, and are there more?
[01:42:02.944 --> 01:42:04.405]  Pedos in either party way?
[01:42:04.445 --> 01:42:05.526]  Or how does this work?
[01:42:06.206 --> 01:42:07.127]  Well, I think you're right.
[01:42:07.207 --> 01:42:13.091]  I think it's the ones who wake up in the morning and start yelling and screaming about gay rights.
[01:42:13.972 --> 01:42:14.732]  I mean, what do they do?
[01:42:14.772 --> 01:42:16.153]  They live and breathe this every day.
[01:42:16.193 --> 01:42:17.775]  They're usually the ones that are caught.
[01:42:19.035 --> 01:42:21.357]  You know, these people, I mean, they have a problem.
[01:42:21.897 --> 01:42:23.839]  And nine times out of ten,
[01:42:24.499 --> 01:42:28.182]  You know, we were talking about Miss South Carolina, Lindsey Graham.
[01:42:29.282 --> 01:42:44.172]  Yeah, I mean there's a perfect example where everybody in South Carolina knows about him, but yet he's the first one to stand up on the soapbox and talk about how, you know, we can't have a same-sex marriage and all these other things.
[01:42:44.553 --> 01:42:45.013]  So I think
[01:42:45.573 --> 01:43:09.911]  You know, I do recall that one person back in the early 80s who was going to be censured by the House for running a cowboy service allegedly out of his basement of his townhouse said, look, you go after me, I'm going to right now name 25% of the House members I know, and this is back then, so it was a different kind of mindset.
[01:43:09.931 --> 01:43:11.612]  That's Barney Frank on the House floor!
[01:43:11.952 --> 01:43:13.013]  That was Barney Frank.
[01:43:13.273 --> 01:43:14.114]  Right, exactly.
[01:43:14.574 --> 01:43:17.296]  And they were mostly Republicans he was talking about.
[01:43:17.457 --> 01:43:24.362]  So, obviously, there was no interest in pursuing that to any sort of... Well, that's my issue, though.
[01:43:24.382 --> 01:43:26.224]  They don't indict him, but they indict Hastert.
[01:43:27.879 --> 01:43:33.902]  Is this then, do you think, or do you know, a war, a blackmail war to get the Republicans to go along with stuff?
[01:43:34.162 --> 01:43:35.163]  Because they don't need to.
[01:43:35.183 --> 01:43:36.704]  The Republicans are doing whatever they're told.
[01:43:37.404 --> 01:43:48.770]  Well, I'm afraid that with all the powers that NSA has to do fishnet trawling of mega data, bulk data, that this is the type of thing that can result from that.
[01:43:48.911 --> 01:43:53.053]  That they go on fishing expeditions and if they find... Remember, they got Hastert.
[01:43:53.613 --> 01:43:58.255]  Really for failing to report currency transactions.
[01:43:58.555 --> 01:44:05.138]  He started, first he took out $50,000 from bank accounts and then he kept it under the $10,000 threshold.
[01:44:05.558 --> 01:44:14.702]  If you go over $10,000 there's an automatic report made under federal banking regulations to the federal government, to the IRS and others.
[01:44:15.302 --> 01:44:24.547]  If NSA is trolling everybody's bank accounts and transactions, email, what have you, yeah, they can get this information.
[01:44:24.607 --> 01:44:31.811]  So I'm wondering whether we're going to see a lot more of this because of the NSA power to eavesdrop.
[01:44:32.031 --> 01:44:43.757]  Yet some of these congressmen that are in jeopardy and extremists are the biggest supporters of expanded NSA wiretapping and collection powers.
[01:44:43.777 --> 01:44:45.698]  What was it our guest said yesterday, Joel Skousen?
[01:44:46.418 --> 01:44:48.820]  Evil always carries with it the seeds of its own destruction.
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:52.842]  And it's crazy, yeah, these guys do what destroys them.
[01:44:52.962 --> 01:44:55.203]  They dig a pit for us and then they fall into it.
[01:44:56.144 --> 01:44:56.424]  Right.
[01:44:56.444 --> 01:45:02.546]  They're not thinking ahead, that's for sure, because they're the ones that have the most to lose.
[01:45:03.767 --> 01:45:06.248]  Because even after they leave Congress, what happens?
[01:45:06.268 --> 01:45:09.509]  They could become lobbyists, in many cases for foreign governments.
[01:45:09.569 --> 01:45:12.030]  That stuff is all fair game for the NSA.
[01:45:12.050 --> 01:45:13.851]  That's right.
[01:45:13.931 --> 01:45:16.992]  Once they work for a foreign government, it's open to be spied on.
[01:45:18.365 --> 01:45:18.966]  Absolutely.
[01:45:19.247 --> 01:45:19.888]  That's another thing.
[01:45:19.948 --> 01:45:27.041]  How does Hillary take money from dictators at the State Department, through her foundation, to then let them have billion-dollar weapon systems?
[01:45:27.362 --> 01:45:30.247]  That is just so over-the-top cut-and-dry.
[01:45:31.198 --> 01:45:31.638]  Right.
[01:45:31.718 --> 01:45:36.962]  And look, she even took money from the FIFO, the World Cup sponsoring organization.
[01:45:36.982 --> 01:45:39.304]  They, of course, indicted several officials.
[01:45:39.804 --> 01:45:41.025]  See, what is that about?
[01:45:41.305 --> 01:45:44.587]  I mean, you've got just incredible crime going on all over the country.
[01:45:44.867 --> 01:45:51.472]  Banks laundering hundreds of billions, running the aircraft, running white slavery rings, and they're going to harass the Soccer Commission.
[01:45:51.832 --> 01:45:59.659]  No, no banker was indicted as a result of that settlement that announced by the news attorney general Loretta Lynch.
[01:46:00.841 --> 01:46:02.602]  5.8 billion to steal trillions.
[01:46:02.983 --> 01:46:06.846]  Right, they go after non-US citizens are going to extradite them to the United States.
[01:46:07.227 --> 01:46:14.974]  I think that has to do with the fact in 2018 Russia is sponsoring, is going to be the host of the World Cup and Palestine recently asked
[01:46:15.214 --> 01:46:15.494]  I think?
[01:46:30.282 --> 01:46:33.204]  And I wouldn't put that past this administration.
[01:46:33.965 --> 01:46:40.189]  After all, what we've seen them do in rattling the sabers against Russia and now China, I don't know.
[01:46:40.209 --> 01:46:52.517]  Obama, if he doesn't have much to do before he leaves office, he ought to just identify all the neocons that stayed in this administration from the past one and fire the lot of them.
[01:46:52.537 --> 01:46:59.922]  Get rid of all of them because they're putting this country and the world in jeopardy as a result of these policies.
[01:47:01.363 --> 01:47:04.524]  Well, Putin is coming out and saying that it's basically a screw-up.
[01:47:04.624 --> 01:47:06.565]  They're hosting the World Cup.
[01:47:07.305 --> 01:47:10.807]  And that's really what this all comes down to, is a war on Russia.
[01:47:10.847 --> 01:47:15.569]  And again, I don't lionize Putin, but I'm not into starting fights.
[01:47:17.347 --> 01:47:32.255]  The West and Soros is starting the fight and then Soros has the nerve to run around and whine and go, don't start World War III when he's bragging on Fareed Zarkaria on CNN that he, quote,
[01:47:33.644 --> 01:47:35.244]  Uh, basically toppled Ukraine.
[01:47:35.965 --> 01:47:40.166]  Yeah, Soros sees a way to make money if there's a war with China or Russia.
[01:47:40.186 --> 01:47:44.967]  He's now trying to overthrow the government of Macedonia the same way he did it in Ukraine.
[01:47:45.287 --> 01:47:47.868]  And that, you know, playing around with the Balkans.
[01:47:47.928 --> 01:47:50.508]  Remember what happened 101 years ago in the Balkans?
[01:47:50.948 --> 01:47:52.809]  Sarajevo assassination.
[01:47:52.829 --> 01:47:53.289]  World War I.
[01:47:53.829 --> 01:47:57.091]  World War I, the war that they said warred to end all wars.
[01:47:57.151 --> 01:48:11.641]  Of course it wasn't, but that's why this guy Soros needs to be put in a straitjacket and, you know, in a place like Hannibal Lecter where he... Well, he's beyond exactly how... comic book bad guys.
[01:48:12.737 --> 01:48:13.458]  Are one thing.
[01:48:13.638 --> 01:48:30.099]  When I grew up, I thought there's nobody really like this until I sort of... Soros, I mean a weirdo Nazi collaborator, 87 years old, involved toppling governments, trying to put radical Islamists to control the Middle East, trying to... I mean, he is a horrible person.
[01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:32.682]  He's the perfect James Bond villain.
[01:48:32.722 --> 01:48:43.652]  I don't know which one he would be, whether it be Blofeld or Goldfinger or Carver, but he's probably a mixture of all of them put together.
[01:48:43.712 --> 01:48:45.153]  His name is Georgie Schwartz.
[01:48:45.193 --> 01:48:46.655]  He adopted George Soros.
[01:48:47.155 --> 01:48:49.838]  Soros, it's spelled backwards and forwards the same way.
[01:48:50.598 --> 01:48:53.221]  God, Ian Fleming missed out on this guy as a villain.
[01:48:54.701 --> 01:48:55.602]  Let's get into ISIS.
[01:48:55.622 --> 01:48:56.422]  We've got one more segment.
[01:48:56.442 --> 01:48:57.183]  I really appreciate your time.
[01:48:57.223 --> 01:48:59.925]  Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist who broke the Hastert News.
[01:49:01.046 --> 01:49:02.247]  Gosh, nine years ago.
[01:49:02.347 --> 01:49:03.948]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:49:03.968 --> 01:49:04.728]  Spread that around.
[01:49:05.409 --> 01:49:09.012]  Flashback investigative journalist broke ex-speaker Hastert's blackmail sex scandal in 2006.
[01:49:09.932 --> 01:49:10.893]  Read the excerpts there.
[01:49:11.453 --> 01:49:12.674]  Wayne, ISIS.
[01:49:12.874 --> 01:49:14.035]  I mean, this is so naked.
[01:49:14.636 --> 01:49:15.837]  How's it going for ISIS?
[01:49:15.877 --> 01:49:17.198]  How's it going for Saudi Arabia?
[01:49:18.038 --> 01:49:21.341]  And can they keep it hidden from the public that NATO's running the whole deal?
[01:49:22.230 --> 01:49:43.465]  Well, the group Judicial Watch managed to get a hold of this declassified Defense Intelligence Agency message, which basically, from 2012, it states that the Western powers, the Gulf states and Turkey, should all support these radical Syrian groups to bring down Assad.
[01:49:44.226 --> 01:49:46.127]  They talked about who they were.
[01:49:47.228 --> 01:50:01.242]  Al-Qaeda in Iraq, which became ISIL, or ISIS, the Muslim Brotherhood, and the other Syrian rebel group.
[01:50:02.043 --> 01:50:05.306]  They're called the Sofalazist or the... It's the Salafists, yes.
[01:50:06.187 --> 01:50:11.855]  The Salafists and they're basically Wahhabists who tow the Saudi Wahhabist line.
[01:50:12.576 --> 01:50:18.584]  So here we have proof that the US was responsible for this.
[01:50:19.064 --> 01:50:22.769]  John Brennan is the real godfather of ISIL.
[01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:23.490]  Here's a guy
[01:50:24.431 --> 01:50:32.195]  Who was a former CIA station chief in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, is very much a pro-Saudi person.
[01:50:32.895 --> 01:50:42.999]  And there are reports that he visited Mecca, which you can only really do if you're a personal guest of the Saudi king, or you're a convert to Islam.
[01:50:43.419 --> 01:50:49.722]  And I think there was a former FBI agent who said, yes, Brennan did convert to Islam.
[01:50:50.082 --> 01:50:51.343]  And we know that he, remember,
[01:50:51.923 --> 01:50:52.283]  Stay there.
[01:50:52.323 --> 01:50:52.983]  Let's break it down.
[01:50:53.024 --> 01:50:54.424]  This is so bombshell, folks.
[01:50:54.464 --> 01:50:55.024]  You understand.
[01:50:55.585 --> 01:50:57.905]  Somebody's risking their life to give Judicial Watch.
[01:50:58.166 --> 01:50:59.846]  Judicial Watch is risking getting arrested.
[01:50:59.946 --> 01:51:01.367]  They arrest whistleblower groups now.
[01:51:01.387 --> 01:51:04.128]  I mean, I'd be scared to put it out if I got something like that.
[01:51:04.348 --> 01:51:04.808]  I would.
[01:51:05.369 --> 01:51:08.710]  Defense intelligence that our government put Al Qaeda in charge over there.
[01:51:09.343 --> 01:51:09.964]  I mean, that's big.
[01:51:10.084 --> 01:51:10.585]  That's proof.
[01:51:10.745 --> 01:51:14.810]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:14.850 --> 01:51:17.874]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:18.034 --> 01:51:19.376]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:19.676 --> 01:51:22.720]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:23.981]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:51:24.522 --> 01:51:25.644]  Just won't quit.
[01:51:26.432 --> 01:51:28.375]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[01:51:28.615 --> 01:51:33.161]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[01:51:41.212 --> 01:51:46.994]  So I say to Market Lunch, look, you know, I keep hearing from the government that, you know, they're worried someday ISIS may get here.
[01:51:47.335 --> 01:51:52.777]  And I go, duh, Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting, ISIS is already here.
[01:51:53.157 --> 01:51:55.178]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me.
[01:51:55.378 --> 01:51:59.480]  If they don't know ISIS is here already, they got no clue, I'm taking care of myself.
[01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:06.182]  Guns80.com, AR-15 kits, 30 shot magazines, great prices, they've even got the Hillary special.
[01:52:06.242 --> 01:52:07.243]  Guns80.com, that's 844-2Guns80, Guns80.com.
[01:52:12.216 --> 01:52:14.257]  The folks at My Patriot Supply get it.
[01:52:14.518 --> 01:52:18.360]  They know the world can be unpredictable, and there are some scary things happening right now.
[01:52:18.861 --> 01:52:25.966]  The only way we can make sure we maintain our independence, despite the situation, is to take control and get prepared.
[01:52:26.466 --> 01:52:29.969]  They've come up with a deal that will help you get prepared for anything.

[01:52:43.739 --> 01:52:44.879]  Limit two per caller.
[01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:50.844]  This offer isn't available online, so take advantage of this opportunity to get prepared today.
[01:52:50.864 --> 01:52:53.806]  800-274-3070 to get your four-week food supply for the incredible price of only $99.
[01:52:53.846 --> 01:52:54.587]  Call 800-274-3070 right now.
[01:52:54.607 --> 01:52:54.827]  That's 800-274-3070.
[01:53:04.794 --> 01:53:08.921]  Call 274-3070 to claim yours while supplies last.
[01:53:10.655 --> 01:53:12.436]  Are you suffering from EP?
[01:53:12.756 --> 01:53:15.558]  The symptoms include fraudulent charges to your credit card.
[01:53:15.658 --> 01:53:18.000]  Your subway card says it's empty, but you bought it yesterday.
[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:22.803]  Someone's been in your hotel room, but the desk clerk says they only show you entering the room.
[01:53:23.043 --> 01:53:24.564]  These are signs of EP.
[01:53:24.844 --> 01:53:26.285]  Electronic pickpocketing.
[01:53:26.485 --> 01:53:29.307]  Payment cards, transit cards, even hotel room keys.
[01:53:29.587 --> 01:53:34.770]  Use a radio chip so you can just wave your card at the register, the turnstile, or your hotel room door.
[01:53:34.930 --> 01:53:38.893]  But what's convenient for you is also convenient for thieves, waving scanners,
[01:53:39.133 --> 01:53:39.593]  We're good to go.
[01:54:00.521 --> 01:54:04.884]  Warning, ID Stronghold wallets could lead to feelings of safety and security, comfort in crowds, and euphoria.
[01:54:05.004 --> 01:54:09.848]  If you experience these emotions, immediately inform your friends and family about IDStronghold.com so they can feel better too.
[01:54:20.355 --> 01:54:22.797]  It was info wars and our operation that risked.
[01:54:23.576 --> 01:54:28.019]  Our credibility in our lives, I'll be quite frank with you, because I got some serious threats when we did it.
[01:54:28.039 --> 01:54:31.502]  It came out four years ago, and then again two years ago.
[01:54:31.962 --> 01:54:37.066]  Pushed the military to say no to openly arming and backing Al-Qaeda to take down Syria.
[01:54:38.307 --> 01:54:41.269]  Wayne Madsen, of course, and many others at the tip of the spear exposing that.
[01:54:41.729 --> 01:54:44.751]  Now Bloomberg reported today, declassified, U.S.
[01:54:44.831 --> 01:54:48.094]  saw Islamic State coming, let it take Ramadi.
[01:54:48.474 --> 01:54:49.395]  What did we tell you weeks ago?
[01:54:50.845 --> 01:54:51.885]  They're arming them.
[01:54:51.925 --> 01:54:53.586]  The Iraqi government's caught them.
[01:54:56.947 --> 01:54:58.687]  They're led by foreign commandos.
[01:54:59.027 --> 01:55:02.488]  They've been trained by NATO, U.S., Israeli, and other troops.
[01:55:03.769 --> 01:55:07.630]  And folks, no, I'm not anti-Israel, I'm not anti-Turkey, I'm not anti-anybody.
[01:55:08.150 --> 01:55:15.592]  But man, any government that helps Al-Qaeda murder Christians, and these Salafists, same group, it's crazy.
[01:55:16.172 --> 01:55:17.993]  It just shows how evil our government is.
[01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:21.845]  Peaceful Christians by the hundreds of thousands are being displaced.
[01:55:22.186 --> 01:55:23.409]  Tens of thousands are being killed.
[01:55:23.770 --> 01:55:24.872]  Libya is a failed state.
[01:55:25.851 --> 01:55:28.493]  I want to get into that with Wayne Madsen in the last few minutes here with him.
[01:55:28.533 --> 01:55:32.916]  But first, Wayne, I saw on your website you've got something pretty neat happening next Friday.
[01:55:32.936 --> 01:55:46.725]  In fact, if I had enough reporters, or if you can get somebody, you're going to be working with us soon, I'd have them walk with you live with a Skype feed and carry the feed on the nightly news at least, or a recording of it, or parts of it on the live show.
[01:55:47.025 --> 01:55:54.890]  You're doing something really exciting as a historian, not just a former NSA guy and reporter, with a spy walking tour.
[01:55:54.910 --> 01:55:55.731]  Tell us about that.
[01:55:56.711 --> 01:56:13.918]  Well, on Friday the 5th of June at 9.30 gathering at the National Press Club at the corner of 14th and F Streets in downtown D.C., we're going to have a Spy and Scandal walking tour of the downtown area to mark the 10th anniversary of my website.
[01:56:14.258 --> 01:56:19.259]  I can't believe I've been doing this this long, but the Hastert story brought it all back.
[01:56:19.299 --> 01:56:20.920]  That was 2006, the second year of the website.
[01:56:23.621 --> 01:56:27.142]  We'll be hitting a lot of the places that I've written about.
[01:56:28.923 --> 01:56:43.967]  And if there's time, we'll even go walk by the law firm of Dick Steen Shapiro, which is Dennis Hastert's law firm, which apparently he's resigned from their government practices branch yesterday.
[01:56:44.867 --> 01:56:51.974]  There's many scandals within a few blocks of the National Press Club in the White House, which is two blocks away.
[01:56:52.415 --> 01:56:53.876]  So it should be a pretty good time.
[01:56:54.216 --> 01:56:57.159]  Yeah, see, if we were a free country, this would be on Nightline.
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:56:58.961]  And we'd get top ratings, too.
[01:56:59.021 --> 01:57:05.587]  I mean, Telling the Truth also gets ratings, but they won't let you do it because it would destroy their whole criminal system.
[01:57:05.607 --> 01:57:07.029]  But it's all coming to an end.
[01:57:07.329 --> 01:57:09.271]  What do you make of even Bloomberg reporting that
[01:57:09.411 --> 01:57:10.212]  Basically, the U.S.
[01:57:10.232 --> 01:57:12.733]  is working with Al-Qaeda to take over Iraq.
[01:57:12.773 --> 01:57:13.694]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:57:13.714 --> 01:57:15.135]  And take over areas of Syria.
[01:57:15.596 --> 01:57:27.604]  No, it was clear this whole operation was to, it started with getting rid of Saddam, and then Qaddafi in Libya, and now Assad in Syria, Yemen, now a mess, a civil war.
[01:57:28.365 --> 01:57:34.930]  All those governments were secular, and now we run the risk of them being replaced by these Salafists.
[01:57:35.630 --> 01:57:40.192]  Execute women if they get caught not wearing gloves!
[01:57:56.858 --> 01:57:58.119]  I mean, give me a break, man.
[01:57:58.159 --> 01:58:02.603]  Our government's funding people that sexually mutilate women and make them wear gloves.
[01:58:02.623 --> 01:58:03.624]  I mean, I'm just, I'm done!
[01:58:04.185 --> 01:58:06.027]  I'm done with the scum that runs our government.
[01:58:06.447 --> 01:58:08.169]  And you know, this Defense Intelligence League...
[01:58:09.144 --> 01:58:11.345]  That shows people inside are really upset too, right Wayne?
[01:58:11.685 --> 01:58:19.828]  Yes, because I looked at that message and unusually the header information, you know, the from, we don't know where it's from, that's been blocked out.
[01:58:19.928 --> 01:58:26.290]  Some of the action and info at ease at the top of the message have been blacked out.
[01:58:26.330 --> 01:58:28.671]  Normally they don't black that out, but they let the bit
[01:58:29.211 --> 01:58:33.072]  Remain about the U.S.
[01:58:33.172 --> 01:58:41.374]  and Israel and Western Europe, Turkey and the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia and Qatar supporting these radicals to overthrow us.
[01:58:41.394 --> 01:58:43.715]  Yeah, the military is just really upset.
[01:58:43.735 --> 01:58:45.155]  I think the globalists have gone too far.
[01:58:45.175 --> 01:58:46.995]  Wayne Madsen, thank you so much.
[01:58:47.055 --> 01:58:47.555]  God bless you.
[01:58:47.575 --> 01:58:51.897]  It's good to have you on the team.
[01:59:00.262 --> 01:59:00.823]  I want more candy!
[01:59:00.843 --> 01:59:01.703]  I want more video games!
[01:59:01.843 --> 01:59:01.943]  Mine!
[01:59:02.003 --> 01:59:02.124]  Mine!
[01:59:02.184 --> 01:59:02.384]  Mine!
[01:59:03.525 --> 01:59:12.892]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:59:13.252 --> 01:59:15.874]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:59:15.954 --> 01:59:19.297]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:59:19.517 --> 01:59:25.542]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:59:25.842 --> 01:59:28.364]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[01:59:28.544 --> 01:59:28.724]  I'm good.
[01:59:48.462 --> 01:59:50.083]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:16.397 --> 02:00:20.563]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:21.223 --> 02:00:22.024]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.825 --> 02:00:23.707]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.367 --> 02:00:28.012]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.573 --> 02:00:32.618]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:38.950]  Things are heating up.
[02:00:39.070 --> 02:00:41.111]  That really is an understatement.
[02:00:41.191 --> 02:00:41.931]  They're exploding.
[02:00:42.652 --> 02:00:43.232]  Quite literally.
[02:00:43.252 --> 02:00:45.272]  We have volcanoes all over the place going off.
[02:00:45.693 --> 02:00:46.613]  Earthquakes in Alaska.
[02:00:46.673 --> 02:00:47.793]  Earthquakes in California.
[02:00:48.553 --> 02:00:50.914]  It's just... When it rains, it pours.
[02:00:51.354 --> 02:00:58.957]  William F. Jasper, the editor of the New American Magazine, consummate researcher, is going to be joining us on TPP, on globalism.
[02:01:00.590 --> 02:01:02.311]  On political correctness on all of it.
[02:01:02.772 --> 02:01:05.453]  Just the jaw-dropping stuff that's going on.
[02:01:06.334 --> 02:01:08.656]  But I wanted to play a clip of Julian Assange.
[02:01:08.816 --> 02:01:14.039]  And look, I'm not attacking Assange, but I'm sick of it, okay?
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:17.382]  WikiLeaks needs to release the entire TPP.
[02:01:19.043 --> 02:01:26.648]  And I understand they've threatened to go after him even more if he does, so... But they only released the part that Google wants released.
[02:01:27.677 --> 02:01:31.139]  And I think, and I've seen some evidence that Assange and all these guys are kind of connected into that.
[02:01:31.519 --> 02:01:36.581]  Some of these other power arms that don't want the web totally taken from them.
[02:01:37.382 --> 02:01:42.364]  So they'll allow one section to be released about just the end of internet freedom as we know it.
[02:01:42.384 --> 02:01:44.185]  And that's been known for a year and a half now.
[02:01:44.245 --> 02:01:49.668]  It's really helped us almost beat this sovereignty killing garbage.
[02:01:50.368 --> 02:01:55.331]  But then Assange goes, oh, only five of the 29 sections are about traditional trade.
[02:01:56.448 --> 02:01:57.568]  Yeah, it's a total takeover.
[02:01:57.889 --> 02:01:59.269]  So why don't you release it?
[02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:01.710]  Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[02:02:02.690 --> 02:02:11.073]  It's the largest ever international economic treaty that has ever been negotiated.
[02:02:12.854 --> 02:02:14.794]  Very considerably larger than NAFTA.
[02:02:15.475 --> 02:02:16.975]  It is mostly not about trade.
[02:02:17.635 --> 02:02:22.237]  Only five of the 29 chapters are about traditional trade.
[02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:34.156]  The others are about regulating the internet, what internet service providers have to collect information, they have to hand it over to companies under certain circumstances.
[02:02:34.597 --> 02:02:39.564]  It's about regulating labour, what labour conditions can be applied regulating.
[02:02:41.847 --> 02:02:49.691]  Whether you can favor local industry regulating the hospital, healthcare system, privatization of hospitals.
[02:02:49.811 --> 02:02:50.871]  It's global takeover.
[02:02:51.672 --> 02:02:54.233]  Essentially every aspect of the modern economy.
[02:02:54.253 --> 02:02:56.754]  If you like the gang raping, that's what Obamacare is gonna love it.
[02:02:57.215 --> 02:02:59.176]  Are in the TPP.
[02:02:59.216 --> 02:03:00.496]  That's right.
[02:03:00.576 --> 02:03:01.537]  That's good.
[02:03:01.637 --> 02:03:03.078]  Basically the entire...
[02:03:04.577 --> 02:03:17.304]  World system, because it ties into the EU and the NAU, is regulated by this, and Congress is just going to let them create new master law that we can't see, that after it's passed, directs everything.
[02:03:17.605 --> 02:03:20.606]  And then unelected boards make the arbitrations and decisions.
[02:03:21.147 --> 02:03:23.348]  I mean, that is just totally being conquered.
[02:03:23.728 --> 02:03:25.769]  Read the Declaration of Independence, what they complain about.
[02:03:26.230 --> 02:03:28.531]  Foreign, unelected bodies making decisions.
[02:03:28.991 --> 02:03:30.212]  This is the same thing!
[02:03:32.029 --> 02:03:32.490]  Ugh!
[02:03:32.590 --> 02:03:33.870]  Why don't people get angry?
[02:03:34.071 --> 02:03:36.332]  We're being conquered by crooks!
[02:03:37.473 --> 02:03:38.574]  A bunch of pedophiles!
[02:03:38.614 --> 02:03:39.855]  Let's go to the other clip.
[02:03:39.895 --> 02:03:40.275]  Here it is.
[02:03:41.056 --> 02:03:52.744]  What if the government or a state government decides it wants to build a hospital somewhere and there's a private hospital that has been erected nearby?
[02:03:53.404 --> 02:03:58.608]  Well, the TPP gives the constructor of the private hospital the right to sue the government
[02:03:59.148 --> 02:04:01.350]  That's to take over public infrastructure.
[02:04:14.481 --> 02:04:25.928]  And we know from similar instruments where governments can be sued over free trade treaties, that that is used to construct a chilling effect on environmental and health regulation law.
[02:04:27.049 --> 02:04:31.632]  For example, Togo, Australia... That's right, but it's selectively enforced there.
[02:04:31.712 --> 02:04:36.675]  ...all being sued by tobacco companies, Philip Morris... Alright, let's stop there.
[02:04:37.395 --> 02:04:43.763]  And again, it has this environmental stuff that claims it's environmental, but ignores GMO, toxic waste dumping, radiation.
[02:04:44.024 --> 02:04:48.489]  But the very people that are passing carbon taxes, these big banks, oh, that's all in there.
[02:04:48.890 --> 02:04:52.514]  Oh, but the carbon taxes are there, don't worry!
[02:04:53.561 --> 02:04:59.625]  Because it's pure bull to surveil and tax every area of human activity.
[02:04:59.645 --> 02:05:07.050]  And when we got the last treaty documents from Copenhagen during that UN summit, it would basically double taxes on the third world.
[02:05:08.251 --> 02:05:09.072]  So it'll kill them!
[02:05:10.649 --> 02:05:23.724]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[02:05:25.031 --> 02:05:36.793]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[02:05:37.013 --> 02:05:53.296]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[02:05:53.756 --> 02:05:58.343]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming, it's already here.
[02:05:58.764 --> 02:06:02.509]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance.
[02:06:02.990 --> 02:06:04.712]  Infowars.com.
[02:06:09.622 --> 02:06:14.646]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[02:06:39.504 --> 02:06:40.124]  Alex Jones here.
[02:06:40.545 --> 02:06:49.608]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:06:49.808 --> 02:06:53.290]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[02:06:53.610 --> 02:07:01.593]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[02:07:04.254 --> 02:07:05.294]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:12.492 --> 02:07:21.876]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:07:22.236 --> 02:07:24.797]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:07:24.938 --> 02:07:28.299]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:07:28.479 --> 02:07:34.502]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[02:07:34.802 --> 02:07:39.644]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:07:39.944 --> 02:07:46.107]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:07:46.307 --> 02:07:53.790]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:07:54.050 --> 02:08:01.333]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:08:05.214 --> 02:08:08.136]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:08:13.197 --> 02:08:14.978]  There's a need for a new world order.
[02:08:16.079 --> 02:08:22.184]  But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[02:08:23.605 --> 02:08:29.850]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:41.201 --> 02:08:45.462]  William F. Jasper, editor of the New American Magazine, newamerican.com.
[02:08:45.542 --> 02:08:53.565]  I cannot think of a group or organization that's done more long-term to get America in a fighting stance to try to defeat the globalist takeover.
[02:08:53.585 --> 02:09:00.667]  It doesn't mean we're going to win, but the John Birch Society, I'm not a member of it, but I tell you, everything they've done has just been on target.
[02:09:01.007 --> 02:09:02.828]  That's why they've been so demonized and attacked.
[02:09:03.871 --> 02:09:17.923]  Liam F. Jasper was in college back during the Vietnam War when his parents, who were people he really respected, patriots, go from memory, World War II vets, you name it, his dad, were saying, you know, the Vietnam War is wrong.
[02:09:18.844 --> 02:09:20.465]  And he thought, well, this is kooky craziness.
[02:09:20.505 --> 02:09:21.306]  He was a conservative.
[02:09:21.686 --> 02:09:22.567]  I'm going to go look into this.
[02:09:22.647 --> 02:09:23.728]  And he got sold on it.
[02:09:24.148 --> 02:09:28.832]  Ended up being, of course, one of the top guys over there at the New American Magazine, thenewamerican.com.
[02:09:30.712 --> 02:09:36.436]  I'm just telling you who he is, if you don't know who he is, for our giant audience that grows by the day, because people are finally starting to get concerned.
[02:09:37.837 --> 02:09:56.529]  He's been writing a lot about the TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and of course they warned back in the 70s, when Barry Goldwater did, of the trilateralist plan of David Rockefeller, Jimmy Carter, Zbigniew Brzezinski, to get the leaders of Asia, the European Union, which is today, and the American Union together
[02:09:57.987 --> 02:10:03.212]  To transfer governmental power into non-elected secretive corporate quasi-governmental boards.
[02:10:04.093 --> 02:10:04.934]  So we're being conquered.
[02:10:06.736 --> 02:10:08.518]  And these are totalitarians on top of it.
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:12.983]  And now we're told it's secret, you can't see it.
[02:10:13.023 --> 02:10:17.968]  So people are finally getting upset on the left and in the libertarian constitutionalist right.
[02:10:19.252 --> 02:10:21.935]  But reporters have gone out, including our reporters.
[02:10:22.055 --> 02:10:29.903]  My son went out yesterday and basically no one knew what TPP was and then they got angry that a child, you know, a 12-year-old knew and they didn't.
[02:10:31.625 --> 02:10:36.270]  A reporter in Times Square, New York, no one knew out of more than 20 people they talked to.
[02:10:37.844 --> 02:10:41.847]  And that's not even so much the public, it's that the controlled media won't cover it.
[02:10:42.427 --> 02:10:44.609]  They know all about Kim Kardashian, they don't know about that.
[02:10:45.249 --> 02:10:46.810]  So I want to get into all those issues.
[02:10:46.831 --> 02:10:47.831]  I want to get into U.S.
[02:10:47.871 --> 02:10:49.472]  economy contracted big time.
[02:10:50.393 --> 02:11:02.482]  I want to get into the just over the top bombshell information that's old news here, but now the Defense Intelligence Agency documents been leaked last week.
[02:11:04.367 --> 02:11:17.533]  uh... that yes the the the west is running the salafists and the al-qaeda uh... and the other groups it's ninety plus percent al-qaeda it's saudi arabian ryan it's simply over the top and now bloomberg u.s.
[02:11:17.593 --> 02:11:32.359]  saw islamic state coming let it take ramadi well i mean we told you that but now it's in the news today bloomberg so our own military this is you know pushing it too far our own military is now
[02:11:33.902 --> 02:11:37.685]  They rebelled two years ago saying no air force for Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[02:11:38.086 --> 02:11:39.787]  Ted Cruz came out, Rand Paul came out.
[02:11:39.827 --> 02:11:42.950]  That was a sea change moment in my view, of real awakening.
[02:11:43.530 --> 02:11:52.358]  The public may not know which planet they're on, on average, but the military understands that we're putting people in that are blowing up churches, killing priests, murdering children.
[02:11:52.418 --> 02:11:53.539]  I mean, this is really dirty.
[02:11:54.380 --> 02:11:57.983]  And I think they've gone too far, especially if we push this and get this out.
[02:11:58.543 --> 02:11:59.644]  So that all ties together.
[02:12:00.745 --> 02:12:06.809]  Pentagon ISIS created to remove Assad and now be a proxy army and then they'll use the threat to take liberty here.
[02:12:07.270 --> 02:12:20.019]  Our own Joe Biggs is on a plane right now and he'll be getting there beforehand to cover at six o'clock tonight in Phoenix the protest outside a mosque and the draw Muhammad free speech demonstration.
[02:12:20.539 --> 02:12:22.281]  Regardless of what you think of that, it's free speech.
[02:12:23.041 --> 02:12:24.322]  ISIS has vowed to attack.
[02:12:25.503 --> 02:12:29.506]  This is the mosque where two of the terrorists that got taken out in Garland went to.
[02:12:30.691 --> 02:12:34.034]  Now see, the globalists want a clash of civilizations, but not one preemptively.
[02:12:35.375 --> 02:12:37.497]  So we'll get William F. Jaspers' take on that.
[02:12:37.557 --> 02:12:42.562]  William, I've thrown out a kind of a grab bag of issues here, but they all tie together.
[02:12:43.242 --> 02:12:45.645]  Overall, I think there is a huge awakening happening.
[02:12:46.585 --> 02:12:49.848]  I want to get into TPP with you, but what do you make
[02:12:50.789 --> 02:13:06.998]  Of the good leaks that the government's admitting are real, they're very upset, the criminals in the government that think we're so stupid that we're going to stand by and let them publicly fund Al Qaeda and change the name to ISIS to confuse us and have them commit war crimes everywhere.
[02:13:07.018 --> 02:13:10.960]  I mean, this is really, I think, jumping the shark.
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:11.500]  What do you think?
[02:13:12.605 --> 02:13:22.030]  Well, Alex, you're so right, and I have to commend you for popularly getting this out there to so many people.
[02:13:22.610 --> 02:13:32.836]  Because we've been trying to report on this for years, and actually decades, showing how our government has been funding
[02:13:33.456 --> 02:13:50.392]  Virtually all of the enemies that we've been called to go to war against over the last several decades, whether it's the war on drugs, or whether it's the war on terror, or whether it's cases like going to war against Saddam Hussein.
[02:13:50.953 --> 02:13:58.119]  Back in the 1980s, we at the New American were writing against, railing against, ranting against
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:13:59.480]  The U.S.
[02:13:59.580 --> 02:14:06.104]  government, Republican and Democrat, funding Saddam Hussein, pointing out that he was a villain.
[02:14:06.244 --> 02:14:07.665]  He was a bad guy.
[02:14:08.225 --> 02:14:09.386]  We shouldn't be helping him.
[02:14:11.087 --> 02:14:14.889]  And billions of dollars, tens of billions of dollars went to build him up.
[02:14:15.609 --> 02:14:28.638]  Then when it was his time to be taken out, we were told we had to sacrifice our sons and our daughters and our treasure to go over there and take him out for the New World Order.
[02:14:28.919 --> 02:14:30.900]  And then we didn't even do that.
[02:14:30.940 --> 02:14:36.404]  We let him stay in there again so that we could resurrect that plan again.
[02:14:36.764 --> 02:14:45.071]  So this has been happening over and over again and I'm sure you've had my colleague Alex Newman on your show.
[02:14:45.391 --> 02:14:57.922]  He's done a lot on the background of ISIS and ISIS-Al Qaeda in Libya and Yemen and all throughout the Maghreb in the Middle East.
[02:14:59.810 --> 02:15:10.235]  Yes, we've had him on about TPP, but I should get him back on about that, because he's specifically broken it down for your excellent publication that folks can subscribe to or read the articles at thenewamerican.com.
[02:15:11.336 --> 02:15:18.139]  Shifting gears out of that, TPP, again, they've rammed it through the Senate, but now it's got to go to the House.
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:23.922]  We've got all these blackmail scandals firing up right now, I guess, to get the Republicans to get in line, it looks like.
[02:15:25.763 --> 02:15:28.625]  Do you want to cover the attempt to ram it through first, or what's in it?
[02:15:29.881 --> 02:15:40.310]  Well, we can try to do both, but I think it was the comment that you made right at the beginning about your son going out and asking people about it.
[02:15:40.871 --> 02:15:42.232]  That's been my experience.
[02:15:42.452 --> 02:15:51.740]  Other than in select conservative and liberal slash progressive leftists and environmental circles,
[02:15:52.981 --> 02:15:58.045]  Very few people have heard about the TPP or the TTIP.
[02:16:00.106 --> 02:16:06.250]  I know most of your listeners may know, but the TPP stands for Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[02:16:07.190 --> 02:16:12.514]  The TTIP stands for Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
[02:16:12.594 --> 02:16:14.115]  These are the two mammoth
[02:16:15.315 --> 02:16:26.401]  uh... so-called trade agreements they're not even trade agreements and we can get into some some quotes on that they admit the uh... the uh... public officials the u.s.
[02:16:26.461 --> 02:16:42.369]  government officials and the think tank gurus who helped put them together that these are not trade agreements they are partnerships they are economic and political convergence and integration schemes that is
[02:16:43.269 --> 02:17:06.339]  To these twin schemes for the Pacific, Trans-Pacific Oceanic Area and the Trans-Atlantic Oceanic Area are to bring together economically and politically, much in the same way that we've seen in the European Union, the economies and political systems of the United States and these other countries.
[02:17:06.439 --> 02:17:07.660]  With the TPP,
[02:17:08.700 --> 02:17:11.643]  We're talking about currently 12 countries.
[02:17:11.783 --> 02:17:20.570]  Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam.
[02:17:20.770 --> 02:17:22.451]  Pacific Rim countries.
[02:17:23.992 --> 02:17:35.780]  The TPP is just a transition stage to what they have planned further, which is called the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific, which will be made even larger.
[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:38.822]  So that's the scope of the TPP.
[02:17:39.642 --> 02:17:46.987]  The TTIP, of course, would combine us, the United States, and eventually Canada, Mexico, and North America.
[02:17:47.307 --> 02:17:48.988]  William, we've got to go to break.
[02:17:49.028 --> 02:17:51.950]  William F. Jasper, thenewamericanmagazine.com is our guest.
[02:17:51.970 --> 02:18:00.656]  We'll come back and let you go through the trilateral plan, the three global super regions now being merged together with these agreements, the Atlantic and the Pacific.
[02:18:00.936 --> 02:18:04.918]  We'll even pull up a clip of Bush talking about it eight years ago and admitting it.
[02:18:05.379 --> 02:18:07.340]  So all that's coming up with William F. Jasper.
[02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:08.641]  Before we go to break,

[02:18:41.781 --> 02:18:47.202]  And then we've also want to announce we're running out of survival shield True Nascent Iodine X2.
[02:18:47.562 --> 02:18:49.623]  We're the only ones that have this deep earth crystal source.
[02:18:50.023 --> 02:18:50.743]  We're running out.
[02:18:51.949 --> 02:18:53.069]  I'm running out of the crystals.
[02:18:53.470 --> 02:18:55.550]  It's a highly controlled substance in the raw form.
[02:18:55.930 --> 02:18:57.811]  So who knows, you'll be able to get that in the future.
[02:18:58.071 --> 02:19:00.332]  But we will have the original Survival Shield.
[02:19:00.632 --> 02:19:04.813]  So if you want Survival Shield X2, take advantage of it and stockpile it today.

[02:19:11.495 --> 02:19:13.137]  And we're probably going to be able to get more of the crystals.
[02:19:13.157 --> 02:19:18.162]  He's got some, but it's very hard to get from upwards of 12,000 feet in the ground.
[02:19:18.802 --> 02:19:21.185]  They're totally pure compared to other forms of iodine.
[02:19:21.525 --> 02:19:23.907]  That's why it turns bright blue on paper.
[02:19:24.047 --> 02:19:25.208]  Electric purple blue.
[02:19:25.609 --> 02:19:28.792]  Not red, not black, not like the stuff that makes you sick from the store.
[02:19:28.872 --> 02:19:29.893]  It's the good halogen.
[02:19:30.373 --> 02:19:32.896]  That's why there's all the bad halogens in the water and the rest of it.
[02:19:32.916 --> 02:19:33.977]  This is the good halogen.
[02:19:34.457 --> 02:19:38.059]  It's just an amazing thing for my skin, my energy, my everything.
[02:19:38.079 --> 02:19:39.299]  You've heard the folks on about it.
[02:19:39.580 --> 02:19:40.520]  You've heard the reviews.

[02:20:10.481 --> 02:20:19.725]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:20:19.785 --> 02:20:20.525]  This capitalism?
[02:20:20.565 --> 02:20:26.688]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:20:26.748 --> 02:20:30.390]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:20:43.911 --> 02:20:45.152]  And they're getting worse.

[02:21:09.850 --> 02:21:26.282]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[02:21:26.522 --> 02:21:30.005]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[02:21:30.365 --> 02:21:34.028]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:21:34.408 --> 02:21:35.689]  hdfirearms.com.
[02:21:35.950 --> 02:21:39.172]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, special ops people.

[02:22:09.535 --> 02:22:13.057]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:22:13.798 --> 02:22:14.318]  It's true.
[02:22:14.418 --> 02:22:18.361]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:22:18.581 --> 02:22:20.422]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:22:20.963 --> 02:22:25.446]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[02:24:18.361 --> 02:24:19.442]  Central, we're here live.
[02:24:19.502 --> 02:24:23.364]  In fact, weeknights, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWarship Nightly News.
[02:24:23.424 --> 02:24:33.450]  And Joe Biggs will be live at the Draw Prophet Muhammad demonstration outside the mosque where two of these shooters came from that attacked in Dallas.
[02:24:34.711 --> 02:24:37.073]  And I was going to call Joe and say, do you want to go?
[02:24:37.093 --> 02:24:39.714]  Because he was on the East Coast covering the police verdicts.
[02:24:40.495 --> 02:24:41.375]  And he was already gone.
[02:24:41.455 --> 02:24:42.716]  He was already on his way there.
[02:24:42.836 --> 02:24:45.718]  So tonight, 7 o'clock Central,
[02:24:47.022 --> 02:24:49.143]  We'll go into overdrive tonight, so he's live there.
[02:24:49.163 --> 02:24:51.163]  That'll be about 8 o'clock central.
[02:24:51.543 --> 02:24:53.564]  So a big extended live show tonight.
[02:24:53.604 --> 02:24:55.444]  There'll be some tape segments as well.
[02:24:55.844 --> 02:24:57.005]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:24:57.025 --> 02:24:59.105]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:24:59.145 --> 02:25:01.326]  William F. Jasper, The New American Magazine.
[02:25:01.346 --> 02:25:01.926]  He's the editor.
[02:25:02.446 --> 02:25:03.967]  He joins us right now.
[02:25:06.055 --> 02:25:07.756]  William, you got caught up on the break.
[02:25:07.776 --> 02:25:16.861]  You were getting into the Atlantic Treaty and then the TPP, both that then take the three larger unions and start harmonizing them.
[02:25:16.881 --> 02:25:20.723]  I mean, this is the plan that Barry Goldwater warmed up in the 60s and 70s.
[02:25:21.243 --> 02:25:21.763]  Here it is.
[02:25:21.823 --> 02:25:30.207]  And whereas you can't get the public to get upset about being conquered by corporate chieftains, they do seem to get, hey, why can't we see the plan?
[02:25:30.908 --> 02:25:32.128]  Why is it so secret?
[02:25:32.168 --> 02:25:34.910]  I mean, it's so classically totalitarian.
[02:25:35.967 --> 02:26:01.999]  Well yes, and that's one of the areas where we've been able to get some traction on, because it is so blatantly obvious and audacious that they would be carrying out these negotiations in secret, completely off the record, off the books, except for those privileged, cleared participants, private parties, lobbyists,
[02:26:02.759 --> 02:26:27.686]  Representatives of some of the biggest corporate interests in Wall Street, who are allowed to not only have access to these documents, which have been underway for several years now, but our legislators, whom we've elected, are not allowed to have access to them, except in very controlled, restricted conditions.
[02:26:28.166 --> 02:26:36.512]  You and I are not allowed to have any access to them other than those copies that have been leaked to the public illegally.
[02:26:36.992 --> 02:26:43.036]  So you and I have to rely on illegal copies or references to them made by the U.S.
[02:26:43.116 --> 02:26:44.197]  Trade Representative.
[02:26:44.217 --> 02:26:54.564]  And isn't that justice inverted where we're criminal if we're looking at WikiLeaks stuff when our government's being taken over, we're being taken over in secret?
[02:26:54.984 --> 02:26:57.426]  I mean that's just asinine that they would even try this.
[02:26:58.286 --> 02:27:19.233]  Well, and I'm still waiting for some senator or congressman to take advantage of being able to go down to the secret room in the bottom of the Capitol where they have to surrender their cell phone and all other communications devices and then go into a special room.
[02:27:19.773 --> 02:27:22.274]  They then are monitored.
[02:27:22.554 --> 02:27:23.774]  They may not take any-
[02:27:24.535 --> 02:27:26.236]  See how we're already these kept creatures?
[02:27:26.496 --> 02:27:27.517]  Who said it's secret?
[02:27:28.078 --> 02:27:32.842]  I'm still waiting for one of these congressmen to say, well, go ahead and arrest me.
[02:27:33.022 --> 02:27:33.863]  What are you going to do?
[02:27:34.623 --> 02:27:36.665]  I would like for one of them to do that.
[02:27:36.765 --> 02:27:43.651]  Get arrested for trying to represent the people and tell them what it is you're going to be subjected to.
[02:27:44.131 --> 02:27:45.312]  Yeah, you're a real expert on this.
[02:27:45.392 --> 02:27:46.593]  I've tried to understand it.
[02:27:46.754 --> 02:27:48.935]  They've been developing this treaty, as you know, for 10 years.
[02:27:49.924 --> 02:27:55.925]  How did they get it to the point where Congress is convinced they can only go look at it in secret and can't tell anybody?
[02:27:55.965 --> 02:27:59.306]  I mean, we're already run by these foreign groups?
[02:27:59.986 --> 02:28:00.266]  Right.
[02:28:01.186 --> 02:28:04.827]  They can only do this, Alex, because they have gained control.
[02:28:04.907 --> 02:28:11.649]  The globalists, the Oneworlds, have gained control at the top of both parties, the leadership of both the Republicans and the Democrats.
[02:28:11.669 --> 02:28:13.829]  And I'm sure I'm not telling you anything new there.
[02:28:14.429 --> 02:28:16.370]  But, I mean, this is the...
[02:28:17.910 --> 02:28:18.530]  We're good to go.
[02:28:35.908 --> 02:28:47.956]  To pull this over on the American people, together with the help of virtually all of the aligned globalist corporations that are in the Council on Foreign Relations, the U.S.
[02:28:48.216 --> 02:29:01.685]  Business Council, the Global Business Dialogue, the Transatlantic Policy Network, and others of these globalist business alliances.
[02:29:02.405 --> 02:29:19.391]  And so they have a tremendous amount of clout there because government has, we've allowed government to get so big that it now has all these goodies and benefits to hand out and it has all these clubs to hammer people into submission.
[02:29:19.991 --> 02:29:22.332]  So we have
[02:29:23.372 --> 02:29:36.099]  Today, the Republicans jumping on board with this and convincing many of the conservatives that, hey, this is the thing to do, that this is going to help business.
[02:29:36.599 --> 02:29:44.443]  And trying to convince the American conservatives that because it's benefiting these huge corporations, Goldman Sachs, etc.
[02:29:44.463 --> 02:29:44.783]  Stay there!
[02:29:46.304 --> 02:29:47.205]  Come back, we gotta go to break.
[02:29:47.225 --> 02:29:48.865]  Come back, because that's how they're pitching it.
[02:29:48.905 --> 02:29:52.907]  Well, global government's there, so we better go ahead and just join it so we have our say.
[02:29:53.248 --> 02:29:54.908]  That's the trap, and then how do we beat it?
[02:29:55.169 --> 02:29:55.629]  Stay with us.
[02:29:55.669 --> 02:29:56.369]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:56.389 --> 02:29:58.090]  William F. Jasper is our guest.
[02:29:59.671 --> 02:30:00.571]  We're on the march.
[02:30:01.052 --> 02:30:02.652]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.593 --> 02:30:06.454]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:11.917 --> 02:30:12.958]  Self-driving car.
[02:30:14.378 --> 02:30:15.339]  The future doesn't need it.
[02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:18.641]  The future doesn't even like us.
[02:30:19.541 --> 02:30:25.783]  With journalists assembled and offering themselves as human pylons, a self-driving Volvo went full-on Christine.
[02:30:25.803 --> 02:30:30.845]  Accelerating from a distance, it plowed into the journalist who trusted it.
[02:30:31.366 --> 02:30:34.807]  Volvo first said they hadn't purchased the pedestrian avoidance option.
[02:30:35.347 --> 02:30:36.208]  That's an option?
[02:30:36.948 --> 02:30:39.589]  Did they go for the cheaper vehicular manslaughter option?
[02:30:42.162 --> 02:30:47.487]  Then Volvo changed their story and said it was the fault of the owner who failed to activate safety mode.
[02:30:48.728 --> 02:30:54.612]  As we look at the people who failed to move, I ask, would you put your life in the hands of a self-driving car?
[02:30:55.213 --> 02:30:56.514]  You will if you ride in one.
[02:30:58.155 --> 02:31:02.338]  Of course, no accident will ever be the fault of the self-driving car.
[02:31:03.199 --> 02:31:03.459]  Right.
[02:31:03.779 --> 02:31:06.121]  See the video at InfoWars.com.

[02:33:10.679 --> 02:33:11.865]  Thanks for watching!
[02:33:21.696 --> 02:33:24.398]  Waging, waging war on corruption.
[02:33:24.878 --> 02:33:26.559]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:32.262]  William F. Jasper, TheNewAmerican.com is our guest.
[02:33:32.503 --> 02:33:39.547]  That's the flagship magazine of the whole media system that the John Birch Society has.
[02:33:40.427 --> 02:33:43.389]  And if they helped wake my dad up in the 60s,
[02:33:44.981 --> 02:33:52.067]  And his friends, and then I kind of had that in the background when I was a child, even though my dad wasn't really heavily involved in any of that when he was older.
[02:33:53.288 --> 02:33:59.653]  Help me see the world and wake up and do what I've done haphazardly for 20 years, and I've reached exponentially more.
[02:34:00.114 --> 02:34:03.496]  Think how many people we've reached that are going to end up having a big effect.
[02:34:04.377 --> 02:34:10.082]  So the globalists are racing all this through because they know a lot of forces are piling up against them.
[02:34:10.102 --> 02:34:10.642]  That's my view.
[02:34:10.662 --> 02:34:13.405]  We'll see if William F. Jasper agrees with that.
[02:34:14.915 --> 02:34:22.040]  He got cut off by the break, getting into... Will they be able to pass it?
[02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:29.204]  Or even if they can't pass it, will they just have presidents and prime ministers, by executive action, implement it?
[02:34:29.244 --> 02:34:38.470]  Because their argument is, hey, these treaties are done, we have to do it, as Henry Kissinger wrote a month ago, George Soros wrote two weeks ago, in these op-ed pieces that we covered.
[02:34:39.270 --> 02:34:41.252]  We're not joining globalism enough.
[02:34:41.332 --> 02:34:42.472]  Larry Summers did as well.
[02:34:43.965 --> 02:34:46.209]  All the usual suspects that maneuvered us into this crisis.
[02:34:47.971 --> 02:34:51.156]  Their answer is, hey, you're losing at the gambling table, double down.
[02:34:51.918 --> 02:34:53.921]  Or hey, the heroin didn't get you high, take more.
[02:34:55.163 --> 02:34:57.486]  Because they're managing it and getting the power out of it.
[02:34:58.067 --> 02:34:58.968]  They are the villains.
[02:34:59.909 --> 02:35:04.634]  You've got George Herbert Walker Bush, all these usual suspects, talking about their New World Order.
[02:35:05.295 --> 02:35:06.396]  We see what it means.
[02:35:07.457 --> 02:35:13.984]  And then the very one-tenth of one percent that engineered the destruction of free market and all these poor indigent people.
[02:35:15.225 --> 02:35:22.129]  Then invoke race war and class war as a clash of civilizations to get us all fighting with each other while they rob us.
[02:35:22.169 --> 02:35:27.511]  So I want to get into TPP, where it's going, how they're pushing we've got to join it to stay relevant.
[02:35:28.052 --> 02:35:37.857]  And then I want to get into social engineering that William F. Jasper, as a child psychology and a degree, an education from the University of Idaho,
[02:35:39.143 --> 02:35:51.918]  Uh, as well as other letters with his understanding of all this, because he writes a lot about it, where the social engineering aspect is going and what type of world they're going to build if they're successful.
[02:35:52.519 --> 02:35:53.780]  So William F. Jasper, go ahead.
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:54.381]  You've got the floor.
[02:35:56.018 --> 02:35:56.879]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:35:57.820 --> 02:36:03.627]  We were talking about what was happening with the TPP, how they were getting it through Congress.
[02:36:04.047 --> 02:36:14.619]  And, you know, with these business alliances such as the Business Roundtable and the Transatlantic Partnership,
[02:36:16.081 --> 02:36:33.040]  They have put together a huge lobbying force of corporate power and they are able to swamp just about any of the congressional districts or senators
[02:36:34.702 --> 02:36:41.891]  Uh, states, uh, with the, uh, uh, lobbying force that they can bring to bear there.
[02:36:42.312 --> 02:36:51.463]  And they can promise them, as many of the previous senators and congressmen have found, that once they leave office, they will have a very lucrative career.
[02:36:52.383 --> 02:37:00.649]  With one of these corporations or with one of the think tanks or one of these coalitions.
[02:37:00.789 --> 02:37:16.739]  So there's a big incentive there when we have all of this at stake for these congressmen to completely consciously sell out or to just simply deaden the conscience that they have there and pretend that there is no
[02:37:17.700 --> 02:37:23.806]  Real threat here, because what we're talking about, as I've tried to make clear in my writings, is an existential threat.
[02:37:24.146 --> 02:37:29.812]  An existential threat to our sovereignty, our independence, to our constitution, to our liberty.
[02:37:30.693 --> 02:37:34.817]  We saw very good premonition of that.
[02:37:35.237 --> 02:37:59.939]  Really concrete proof of that, a couple of weeks ago, with the May 18th ruling by the World Trade Organization against the United States, against a law passed here by our Congress, the country of origin labeling, COOL, which is simply stated, foreign meat products have to be labeled as foreign meat when they come into this country.
[02:38:00.259 --> 02:38:11.543]  So that Americans can decide, okay, I'd rather have American meat, which already has enough concerns for most of us, or I can buy it from Mexico.
[02:38:11.783 --> 02:38:13.284]  Let me throw the cat out here.
[02:38:13.304 --> 02:38:18.726]  Again, William F. Jasper, the editor of the New American Magazine.
[02:38:20.983 --> 02:38:29.809]  Breaking down global government, how unelected corporate bodies that are secret are now making decisions and basically trying to veto our laws.
[02:38:30.149 --> 02:38:30.890]  Please continue.
[02:38:31.590 --> 02:38:32.251]  Sorry about that.
[02:38:35.053 --> 02:38:41.417]  So we see that they are actually moving to give
[02:38:43.795 --> 02:38:55.873]  The World Trade Organization authority or rather our Congress is willing to now knuckle under to the World Trade Organization as a response to to the World Trade Organization's ruling
[02:38:57.182 --> 02:38:59.704]  Congress didn't say, well, go take a flying leap.
[02:39:00.565 --> 02:39:01.506]  Try to enforce it.
[02:39:02.046 --> 02:39:10.754]  No, immediately, the next day, the House Agriculture Committee got together and said, oh, I guess we have to change our law.
[02:39:10.794 --> 02:39:13.477]  There's nothing we can do about it.
[02:39:15.658 --> 02:39:31.065]  They already introduced legislation with 60 some sponsors to cave in to the WTO, which was a lawsuit brought to the WTO by another free trade agreement, so-called NAFTA.
[02:39:31.885 --> 02:39:33.287]  By Canada and Mexico.
[02:39:34.188 --> 02:39:49.845]  They used NAFTA to claim that simply us labeling, us requiring that foreign meat be labeled was a violation of free trade and caused them harm and so it had to go.
[02:39:51.606 --> 02:40:13.052]  This is a big enough issue, even in its own right, because we should have a right, we do have a right, to even if one agrees with the legislation or does not, we do have a right to pass our own laws and to require that those products coming into our country should follow these guidelines.
[02:40:15.673 --> 02:40:17.475]  Circumvents our own laws, William F. Jasper.
[02:40:17.795 --> 02:40:30.588]  I just put an article up on screen, if you're a TV viewer out there, where the EU is ordering countries to take massive asylum seekers out of Africa and other areas in, as if it's their responsibility to pay for it.
[02:40:30.868 --> 02:40:32.109]  I mean, this is globalism.
[02:40:32.149 --> 02:40:32.450]  Go ahead.
[02:40:33.151 --> 02:41:01.423]  Yes, I mean, so we can be sure, because there are already hundreds of other cases pending before the WTO and NAFTA courts, we can be sure that when the TPP and TTIP, if they are passed, that we will see many, many more lawsuits like this brought before the tribunals, the judicial bodies of the TTIP and the TPP,
[02:41:02.484 --> 02:41:20.249]  And or to the World Trade Organization because frequently these preferential trade agreements, PTAs, which is what they call these free trade agreements, frequently these are bumped up to the WTO or sometimes countries elect to begin at the WTO.
[02:41:20.869 --> 02:41:32.211]  WTO is really an adjunct of the United Nations and it has been from the very beginning a key institution of the whole New World Order.
[02:41:32.251 --> 02:41:43.594]  It's the judicial branch of the New World Order and this judicial branch operates much in the same fashion that our own judiciary does here in the United States in this past century.
[02:41:44.034 --> 02:41:48.635]  It acts as a subversive force to legislate from the bench.
[02:41:49.255 --> 02:41:51.656]  And so we see that happening already.
[02:41:52.297 --> 02:42:12.927]  And what's even more disarming about this is that here we have, right at the beginning, both the TPP and the TTIP architects, the politicians and the gurus who put it together, are referring to both of these documents as living, evolving agreements.
[02:42:13.387 --> 02:42:17.770]  Meaning, as they explain and as we've quoted them at length, that
[02:42:18.863 --> 02:42:39.781]  Regardless of what they say it means today, the agreement, and we don't even know what that is because we haven't had an officially released document, but even once it is released, because it is a living, evolving document, that means that it will mean whatever they say it means or whatever a TPP or WTO judge says.
[02:42:39.801 --> 02:42:40.461]  And this is key.
[02:42:40.502 --> 02:42:42.924]  If folks just joined us, I'm going to interject here because
[02:42:43.484 --> 02:42:49.549]  Just like Obamacare or any other new law they passed that are these big omnibus bills, it's just open-ended.
[02:42:49.569 --> 02:42:50.610]  They do whatever they want.
[02:42:50.991 --> 02:42:51.952]  They have a name for that.
[02:42:52.012 --> 02:43:00.259]  It's called basically dictatorship, oligarchy, basically rule of the elite, diplomatic immunity for the big hedge fund heads.
[02:43:00.739 --> 02:43:07.606]  We see the world they're building of total inequity, selling it under the idea of equality
[02:43:08.809 --> 02:43:18.136]  It's just over the top, and then if you pull back from it, this happened yesterday morning, I was at the gym, and State Senator Rodney Ellis, big Democrat, comes in.
[02:43:18.677 --> 02:43:21.299]  The only two ellipticals in there of a big line were by me.
[02:43:22.260 --> 02:43:30.967]  He gets on, and then a state rep, Trey Martinez, gets up, and they start talking for 15 minutes while I listen.
[02:43:32.159 --> 02:43:44.629]  About how great it's going to be and how Stratford and the CIA are advising them on how wonderful in a few decades or even sooner, five to 15 years they were talking about, how they'll be able to run for office in Mexico City.
[02:43:45.469 --> 02:43:47.751]  Folks can run for office in Texas and Canada.
[02:43:48.091 --> 02:43:49.192]  Now it's going to be one union.
[02:43:49.513 --> 02:43:53.576]  They didn't say, gee, all those conspiracy theorists were right who got the documents.
[02:43:54.898 --> 02:43:57.680]  You know, 20 years ago or 10 years ago with BAMF Canada.
[02:43:58.220 --> 02:44:01.042]  No, no, it was just, oh, it's so cool.
[02:44:01.442 --> 02:44:03.463]  Oh, and it's so cool we get advised.
[02:44:03.883 --> 02:44:04.984]  And they weren't even villains.
[02:44:05.404 --> 02:44:15.010]  Martinez was talking about how interesting it was and how cool it was that, you know, the CIA advises the Department of Public Safety through Dr. Friedman and all this and how neat it is.
[02:44:15.050 --> 02:44:16.951]  So it's sold like it's this new great thing.
[02:44:17.432 --> 02:44:20.794]  You know, we get to be under and then he gets to advance.
[02:44:21.374 --> 02:44:25.516]  And he doesn't want to aspire to be part of the federal government.
[02:44:25.556 --> 02:44:28.136]  No, no, you aspire to be part of the global government.
[02:44:28.737 --> 02:44:36.639]  As you were saying, you just join with these corporations and there's this new place for you in the future on these corporate boards.
[02:44:36.679 --> 02:44:37.760]  And then I looked up the senator.
[02:44:38.180 --> 02:44:39.721]  He's on the main UT board.
[02:44:39.781 --> 02:44:40.681]  He's on everything.
[02:44:41.181 --> 02:44:43.242]  And they're just going, yep, like it's just fun.
[02:44:43.942 --> 02:44:45.783]  There's just no discussion, no nothing.
[02:44:46.263 --> 02:44:48.084]  Oh, they know all about the TPP.
[02:44:48.144 --> 02:44:49.304]  It's a fun new thing.
[02:44:49.584 --> 02:44:50.985]  They know all about the NAU.
[02:44:51.045 --> 02:44:52.025]  It's a fun new thing.
[02:44:52.526 --> 02:44:55.047]  And listen, I'm not even saying these guys are bad people.
[02:44:55.667 --> 02:45:04.971]  They've just so standardized it that we already can't see secret agreements that run our lives because we're already under global government.
[02:45:05.511 --> 02:45:11.954]  Now they're just going to start unwrapping it, unveiling it, unpackaging it, and deploying it.
[02:45:11.974 --> 02:45:12.874]  Do you agree with that statement?
[02:45:14.715 --> 02:45:29.287]  Very much so, and in fact, you see, this is what Americans have to come to understand very quickly, that this process has been underway now for decades, and the fruit is beginning to be quite obvious.
[02:45:30.147 --> 02:45:39.034]  We now have many foreign corporations that own much of the infrastructure and corporate
[02:45:40.295 --> 02:45:42.115]  infrastructure here in the United States.
[02:45:42.455 --> 02:45:45.736]  Many people's jobs are dependent upon these companies.
[02:45:46.096 --> 02:45:51.437]  Many of the American companies do not consider themselves American companies.
[02:45:51.477 --> 02:45:54.358]  They consider themselves globalist, citizens of the world.
[02:45:54.778 --> 02:46:00.439]  They believe in globalization and globalism and in a borderless world.
[02:46:00.539 --> 02:46:05.920]  Many of them are in favor of actually doing away with borders, which is part of the TPP.
[02:46:06.020 --> 02:46:07.180]  It hasn't come out yet.
[02:46:08.321 --> 02:46:35.118]  But there is a whole chapter dedicated to immigration, and the immigration policies are pointing to the same as we saw in the Korean Free Trade Agreement that President Obama presided over, which has greatly increased the L-1 visa guest workers, the so-called temporary guest workers that become permanent.
[02:46:35.838 --> 02:46:49.465]  And President Obama boasted that this was responsible for bringing hundreds of thousands of new immigrants here into the country temporarily and then of course they never have to leave.
[02:46:50.685 --> 02:46:57.389]  So this is leading us toward what we've already seen in the European Union where it is impossible to stop
[02:46:58.169 --> 02:46:59.010]  Migration.
[02:46:59.170 --> 02:47:01.752]  Immigration all of a sudden becomes migration.
[02:47:01.812 --> 02:47:07.778]  And now they're standardizing and saying you will pay by law hundreds of thousands a month, you will go along with it.
[02:47:08.823 --> 02:47:18.668]  Yes, and as you know, a number of the countries have tried to say, well, hey, we're not going to pay welfare for these people.
[02:47:18.728 --> 02:47:24.591]  It's called welfare tourism, where these migrants come in and then they just stay there.
[02:47:24.611 --> 02:47:28.173]  They come in as tourists or as business class people and then they just stay there.
[02:47:28.273 --> 02:47:33.456]  CNN publishes travel guides, so how the Chinese can come here and get on welfare.
[02:47:34.295 --> 02:47:40.840]  Yeah, and so that is happening on a huge scale, and of course that opens up all kinds of problems.
[02:47:41.420 --> 02:47:48.026]  Here we still have the capability of saying, no, you can't go here.
[02:47:48.066 --> 02:47:55.231]  We can, in spite of President Obama, we can have them kicked out if they are here illegally.
[02:47:55.671 --> 02:48:00.735]  Once we become part of a North American Union, once we become part of a
[02:48:01.836 --> 02:48:26.163]  FTA of a FTA a P which is the whole Pacific or the TPP TTIP then any of those people who are at risk of being deported can bring a lawsuit as we saw happened in in England with the Romanian who woman who is on welfare there she said no I have a right to be here and and the court backed her up
[02:48:27.495 --> 02:48:34.719]  So immigration is a huge issue, or migration, a huge issue in the TPP that hasn't been touched yet.
[02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:43.885]  As you pointed out, the vast majority of Americans still have not heard of either the TPP or TTIP.
[02:48:44.165 --> 02:48:45.066]  These are huge
[02:48:45.766 --> 02:48:47.667]  Huge existential threats.
[02:48:47.767 --> 02:48:51.630]  These are going to affect every aspect of every one of our lives.
[02:48:52.190 --> 02:49:00.695]  And the only reason we haven't heard from them is that there is this huge conspiracy in our media to keep everybody dumbed down.
[02:49:01.075 --> 02:49:08.259]  To keep these things, which should be top news issues, so that we can intelligently debate them, make intelligent decisions.
[02:49:08.620 --> 02:49:10.801]  We can't do that if we don't even know about them.
[02:49:11.241 --> 02:49:25.725]  And the news media is not performing its watchdog service, obviously, if they are not even reporting on the fact that our government officials are keeping all of this secret.
[02:49:25.825 --> 02:49:27.766]  I mean, that should be a top story every day.
[02:49:27.786 --> 02:49:34.147]  You should be seeing all of the news anchors out there demanding to know of Obama.
[02:49:34.247 --> 02:49:35.768]  Why isn't this being released?
[02:49:36.308 --> 02:49:39.529]  Demanding to know of John Kerry, to know they give them all these softball
[02:49:40.069 --> 02:49:43.661]  Questions whenever they're up there and they don't even bring this up.
[02:49:46.636 --> 02:49:48.797]  Again, William F. Jasper is our guest.
[02:49:49.837 --> 02:49:58.921]  I'm looking online at my film, Endgame Blueprint, for Global Enslavement, for the clip where Bush was with Merkel and Barroso in like 2007.
[02:49:59.321 --> 02:50:00.542]  It was right as the film was about to come out.
[02:50:00.562 --> 02:50:01.522]  I got the clip and added it.
[02:50:02.002 --> 02:50:09.365]  And he's going, this Atlantic Partnership, the TIPI or whatever you were quoting it as, it all gets mixed in my head.
[02:50:09.385 --> 02:50:12.366]  It was great merging the EU with our American Union.
[02:50:12.406 --> 02:50:13.487]  He actually says it.
[02:50:14.227 --> 02:50:17.128]  So that's what's so crazy about this is it's just out in the open.
[02:50:17.828 --> 02:50:31.312]  Jose Manuel Barroso, a former Maoist communist in his student days, has always been a hardcore leftist, is the European Commission president.
[02:50:31.752 --> 02:50:34.553]  He's made many statements publicly.
[02:50:36.073 --> 02:50:47.878]  Both that he's made to the world, but also publicly in globalist organizations, pointing out that he's for complete union with the United States.
[02:50:48.518 --> 02:50:52.360]  Most Americans are still being told this is about trade, about free trade.
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:57.722]  Look, free trade historically has been about tariffs.
[02:50:58.902 --> 02:51:01.204]  This is about regulations of every facet of life.
[02:51:01.244 --> 02:51:02.465]  Come back and break it down for us.
[02:51:02.805 --> 02:51:03.506]  Liam F. Jasper.
[02:51:03.526 --> 02:51:05.447]  And I want to talk about how do we beat this.
[02:51:06.028 --> 02:51:09.710]  In the final segment, straight ahead, InfoWars.com.
[02:51:10.211 --> 02:51:11.912]  It's absolutely heartbreaking.
[02:51:12.192 --> 02:51:21.879]  All over America, people are suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, irregular heartbeat, clogged arteries, and high cholesterol.
[02:51:22.099 --> 02:51:27.343]  Can you live your life free from sickness, pain, and fear and experience your body healing itself?
[02:51:27.663 --> 02:51:32.567]  Look to Heart and Body Extract, an all-natural supplement that aids ailing bodies.
[02:51:32.727 --> 02:51:36.230]  It has an exclusive formula of wild-crafted and organic herbs.
[02:51:36.530 --> 02:51:39.593]  End the pain without all the side effects of prescription drugs.
[02:51:39.813 --> 02:51:42.634]  People 20 years younger will envy your vitality.
[02:51:42.835 --> 02:51:44.375]  Want a happier, healthier you?

[02:51:56.341 --> 02:51:57.322]  What are you waiting for?
[02:51:57.482 --> 02:52:02.945]  Call Heart and Body now at 866-295-5305 for your free information.
[02:52:03.085 --> 02:52:04.786]  Go to heartandbody.com, 866-295-5305.
[02:52:04.806 --> 02:52:06.126]  Distributor inquiries welcome.
[02:52:09.918 --> 02:52:29.495]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[02:52:29.675 --> 02:52:30.096]  Well then,
[02:52:30.436 --> 02:52:34.097]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:52:34.337 --> 02:52:35.738]  hdfirearms.com.
[02:52:36.018 --> 02:52:39.219]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[02:52:39.339 --> 02:52:44.240]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[02:52:44.460 --> 02:52:48.202]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[02:52:48.402 --> 02:52:50.682]  Go to their website, hdfirearms.com.
[02:52:50.762 --> 02:52:55.004]  Buy right off their website, and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[02:52:55.184 --> 02:52:58.385]  You can pick it up at the gun show, you can pick it up at a local sporting goods store.
[02:52:58.545 --> 02:52:59.285]  Whatever you do,
[02:52:59.705 --> 02:53:02.686]  Get your Head Down firearm today.
[02:53:02.866 --> 02:53:07.267]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[02:53:07.387 --> 02:53:08.548]  HDfirearms.com.
[02:53:09.768 --> 02:53:11.509]  What's your health worth to you?
[02:53:11.809 --> 02:53:17.111]  You probably can't place an exact value on it, but its importance has certainly increased greatly as you've grown older.
[02:53:17.311 --> 02:53:21.632]  Yet some companies seem to believe you can be lured in with cheap prices and false promises.
[02:53:21.892 --> 02:53:25.233]  That's never been the way Supernatural Silver has chosen to do business.
[02:53:25.513 --> 02:53:30.554]  Long ago, we set out to create a product that was light years beyond colloidal and ionic silver.
[02:53:30.774 --> 02:53:37.235]  Through extensive research and testing, we succeeded in making Supernatural Silver hundreds of times more effective.
[02:53:37.375 --> 02:53:41.976]  Some might call us a premium product, but we've simply strived to be a product that worked.
[02:53:42.256 --> 02:53:49.917]  Supernatural Silver is strong enough to fight off viruses, bacteria, and fungus, but safe enough to be used internally or topically.
[02:53:50.177 --> 02:53:57.003]  And it's powerful enough that just a handful of applications per week can give you better results than the daily use of those bargain silvers.
[02:53:57.283 --> 02:53:59.845]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com today.
[02:54:00.305 --> 02:54:04.108]  And use the promo code SILVER2015 for 30% off your order.
[02:54:04.349 --> 02:54:08.872]  Give yourself and your loved ones a fighting chance with Supernatural Silver.
[02:54:11.475 --> 02:54:14.217]  The Superstakes themselves are being merged.
[02:54:17.091 --> 02:54:21.175]  On April 30th, 2007, a summit was held at the White House.
[02:54:22.075 --> 02:54:26.939]  The Security and Prosperity Partnership's secretive approach had alarmed the public.
[02:54:27.840 --> 02:54:35.867]  So this time, President Bush, German Chancellor Merkel, and EU Commission President Barroso hid their treachery in plain sight.
[02:54:35.887 --> 02:54:42.313]  I thank the Chancellor and Josie very much for the transatlantic
[02:54:43.254 --> 02:54:44.675]  Economic integration plan.
[02:54:45.115 --> 02:54:48.256]  And for that too, we need to develop a common market, common standards.
[02:54:48.736 --> 02:55:06.882]  So this is indeed a very important agreement and an agreement that also brings with it the Transatlantic Economic Council to be a permanent body with senior people on both sides of the Atlantic that will look at all those issues in a concrete manner in which way we can make it move forward.
[02:55:08.214 --> 02:55:12.936]  The BBC reported that the US and EU had agreed on a single market.
[02:55:13.996 --> 02:55:22.839]  By announcing a new economic community integration, they were simply repeating what had been done in America and the EU on a larger scale.
[02:55:23.849 --> 02:55:30.436]  The accord states that the two blocks will aggressively push regulatory convergence in more than 35 areas.
[02:55:31.097 --> 02:55:37.463]  From financial services, intellectual property, military, education, mergers and acquisitions.
[02:55:38.004 --> 02:55:41.688]  They also agreed to jointly push a global carbon tax.
[02:55:42.816 --> 02:55:45.356]  We recognize that we have a problem with greenhouse gases.
[02:55:45.737 --> 02:55:47.057]  We agree there is a global threat.
[02:55:47.097 --> 02:55:48.057]  It's a serious threat.
[02:55:48.517 --> 02:55:53.598]  We agree there is... Alright folks, that's from Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, 2008.
[02:55:54.298 --> 02:55:56.518]  Most important film I've made, two and a half hours long.
[02:55:56.959 --> 02:56:02.540]  You can buy the DVD at infowarestore.com if you want to support this type of work, or just pass the YouTube on.
[02:56:02.680 --> 02:56:04.020]  One has like four and a half million views.
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:05.920]  Pass it on to friends and family.
[02:56:06.340 --> 02:56:10.521]  I'm proud of the fact that Obama deception with all the versions has been seen 50 million times.
[02:56:11.181 --> 02:56:12.843]  This needs to be seen 50 million times.
[02:56:12.903 --> 02:56:16.587]  Before it was taken off Google Video, it had been seen 8 million times there.
[02:56:17.488 --> 02:56:19.550]  So it's got 12, 13 million views.
[02:56:21.573 --> 02:56:22.734]  Listen, it needs to be seen.
[02:56:22.794 --> 02:56:23.755]  People need to understand.
[02:56:23.775 --> 02:56:24.956]  You want to understand TPP?
[02:56:24.996 --> 02:56:25.517]  This is it.
[02:56:25.937 --> 02:56:28.721]  As William F. Jaspers said, it's the same plan over and over again.
[02:56:29.281 --> 02:56:31.522]  Please become members of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:56:32.242 --> 02:56:35.964]  20 people can use each membership to see the nightly news and the films and so much more.
[02:56:36.264 --> 02:56:41.106]  You're funding the tip of the spear of a hardcore operation dedicated to exposing and fighting this.
[02:56:41.806 --> 02:56:45.147]  Buy the high-quality products at InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:56:52.310 --> 02:56:54.171]  All right, we've got three and a half minutes left.
[02:56:54.211 --> 02:56:56.572]  William F. Jasper putting bookends on this.
[02:56:56.632 --> 02:56:57.572]  How do we beat this?
[02:56:57.873 --> 02:56:58.573]  Other key points.
[02:56:59.636 --> 02:57:11.539]  Well, it's going to come down to the old game of boots on the ground and really hammering out messages to your congressmen, to your senators on a regular basis.
[02:57:11.779 --> 02:57:19.662]  That means right now when they're home on breaks, on recesses, when they're holding town hall meetings, they need to be
[02:57:21.263 --> 02:57:21.603]  Thank you.
[02:57:42.046 --> 02:57:57.697]  That means not just going out after the congressman and the senators again and again, calling them, writing them, emailing them, but go talk to your local Chamber of Commerce and your local businesses that are being affected by this.
[02:57:58.797 --> 02:58:04.941]  Let them know what is happening and get them on board because they're going to be completely wiped out by this.
[02:58:05.822 --> 02:58:11.486]  Just the one issue of the investor state regulation
[02:58:12.387 --> 02:58:14.068]  It's just over the top, you know.
[02:58:29.904 --> 02:58:31.084]  Do five more minutes of Overdrive.
[02:58:31.104 --> 02:58:31.924]  We have a one-minute break.
[02:58:31.944 --> 02:58:33.605]  I want you to finish up on solutions.
[02:58:33.645 --> 02:58:35.765]  Some stations don't carry it, but it's internet.
[02:58:35.885 --> 02:58:37.145]  Infowars.com.
[02:58:37.205 --> 02:58:39.126]  We have a free feed there.
[02:58:39.146 --> 02:58:41.906]  We're going to go into Overdrive for five minutes with William F. Jasper.
[02:58:42.226 --> 02:58:44.286]  People get upset about the Feds taking over?
[02:58:44.607 --> 02:58:46.947]  This is global secret corporations?
[02:58:47.467 --> 02:58:49.487]  And if they get away with this, what's next?
[02:58:49.547 --> 02:58:51.608]  I mean, we've got to stand up, folks.
[02:58:51.648 --> 02:58:52.048]  Stay with us.
[02:59:00.171 --> 02:59:16.578]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[02:59:16.818 --> 02:59:20.320]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then.
[02:59:20.660 --> 02:59:24.322]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:59:24.722 --> 02:59:25.983]  hdfirearms.com.
[02:59:26.263 --> 02:59:29.465]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, special ops people.
[02:59:29.585 --> 02:59:34.487]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[02:59:34.687 --> 02:59:38.449]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[02:59:38.649 --> 02:59:40.930]  Go to their website, hdfirearms.com.
[02:59:41.010 --> 02:59:45.233]  Buy right off their website, and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[02:59:45.433 --> 02:59:48.614]  You can pick it up at the gun show, you can pick it up at a local sporting goods store.
[02:59:48.794 --> 02:59:49.535]  Whatever you do,
[02:59:49.955 --> 02:59:52.877]  Get your Head Down Firearm today!
[02:59:52.897 --> 02:59:57.519]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms!
[02:59:57.840 --> 02:59:58.800]  HDFirearms.com!
[02:59:59.020 --> 03:00:05.304]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:12.958 --> 03:00:18.983]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:19.584 --> 03:00:22.606]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:23.067 --> 03:00:28.331]  Alright, final segment as we talk about ways to defeat the TPP.
[03:00:29.192 --> 03:00:31.434]  I mean, look, Obama's already pretty much opened the borders up.
[03:00:31.634 --> 03:00:40.722]  They're doing it all by fiat, but they want it on paper, these big shadowy boards, so they can share liability and basically mitigate it.
[03:00:41.599 --> 03:00:44.161]  And where they can shut down markets, shut down their competition.
[03:00:44.181 --> 03:00:46.042]  You were trying to get into that and talk about solutions.
[03:00:46.062 --> 03:00:49.064]  Yeah, where foreign companies can operate here and be exempt.
[03:00:51.145 --> 03:00:52.866]  This is a get-out-of-jail-free card.
[03:00:52.946 --> 03:00:54.787]  This is new titles of nobility.
[03:00:55.588 --> 03:00:58.369]  This is just like the UN giving itself diplomatic immunity.
[03:00:58.869 --> 03:01:00.310]  This is the new royalty.
[03:01:00.350 --> 03:01:07.495]  This is the antithesis of the Renaissance or the American system and is flaming authoritarianism.
[03:01:07.995 --> 03:01:11.097]  I don't see how anyone would support this, William F. Jasper.
[03:01:12.213 --> 03:01:12.653]  Well, yes.
[03:01:12.873 --> 03:01:22.197]  I mean, we didn't even mention we don't have time to go into the possibility, even likelihood, that Obama would slip some gun control measures or ammunition.
[03:01:22.217 --> 03:01:23.097]  Oh, they've said they will.
[03:01:23.137 --> 03:01:24.558]  Sure, talk about that for a minute in Solutions.
[03:01:25.258 --> 03:01:31.120]  Yeah, you know, you might want to get Michael Hammond, General Counsel of Gun Owners of America, on if you haven't had him on.
[03:01:31.160 --> 03:01:32.961]  He's been looking into this.
[03:01:34.481 --> 03:01:51.567]  He tried to get, and others tried to get, Republican leadership in the House and the Senate to stipulate, to provide that, and to prohibit Obama from putting anything in the trade agreements that would in any way affect the Second Amendment.
[03:01:51.607 --> 03:01:52.747]  They refused to do that.
[03:01:53.368 --> 03:02:02.651]  So, we can't count on, if people are misplacing their trust here for the Republican leadership, for McConnell and Hatch and those guys,
[03:02:03.751 --> 03:02:04.591]  to watch out for that.
[03:02:04.632 --> 03:02:05.032]  They're not.
[03:02:05.072 --> 03:02:06.432]  They've already sold out.
[03:02:06.612 --> 03:02:18.317]  So, there are, you know, when we do the nose counts, there are enough people out there who are still susceptible to pressure from the public.
[03:02:18.357 --> 03:02:30.161]  They'll fear it if they get enough people out there at their meetings and they start hearing enough from the boots on the ground that they better not vote for it.
[03:02:30.541 --> 03:02:31.242]  We saw that.
[03:02:31.262 --> 03:02:39.508]  You know, people wrote off the Free Trade Area of the Americas, FTAA, you might recall, a decade ago.
[03:02:39.908 --> 03:02:41.990]  And we had a big campaign on that.
[03:02:42.070 --> 03:02:47.353]  I went to a number of, to Miami and to a number of their big conferences, you might have also.
[03:02:48.014 --> 03:02:50.816]  And a lot of people said, hey, that's gone.
[03:02:50.856 --> 03:02:52.898]  It's not, we're not going to be able to stop it.
[03:02:53.018 --> 03:02:55.760]  Even many of the people on our side said, that's a done deal.
[03:02:55.780 --> 03:02:57.581]  They got too many lined up on their side.
[03:02:57.601 --> 03:02:58.682]  It was all the same people.
[03:02:59.102 --> 03:03:11.825]  All of the same CFR, Globalist, Sprout, all the big corporations, but they didn't have the votes because our side put enough pressure on them that some of the people who were going to vote for it backed out.
[03:03:12.165 --> 03:03:20.347]  We saw the same thing, as you know, with the SPP, the Security and Prosperity Partnership for North America, which was the NASA and NAU, the North American Union.
[03:03:20.607 --> 03:03:27.169]  In other words, they said the answer is integration by stealth in the Banff documents, so they're still trying it, but we're holding them back.
[03:03:27.409 --> 03:03:30.470]  Yes, and that's where these people never give up.
[03:03:30.750 --> 03:03:39.033]  We have to hold them off and then expose them and route them out eventually or they will just keep coming back with these again and again.
[03:03:40.554 --> 03:03:41.954]  Very well said.
[03:03:42.635 --> 03:03:43.935]  How are we doing worldwide?
[03:03:43.975 --> 03:03:51.898]  I mean, in your view, is humanity really starting to wake up or is it not enough of a response for how fast the globalists are moving?
[03:03:51.918 --> 03:03:53.439]  I mean, how are you feeling in your gut?
[03:03:53.459 --> 03:03:56.120]  Well, when you look at it on a human level,
[03:03:58.220 --> 03:04:01.401]  It is not very encouraging.
[03:04:01.481 --> 03:04:24.565]  I asked this of my colleagues around the world and I've just recently been in touch with a number of people and interviewed people in Europe and most of them, although there are people waking up there, they don't have anything like we do in terms of alternate media, in terms of programs like yours, of talk radio, of
[03:04:26.517 --> 03:04:44.788]  uh... organizations on on them the moral issues uh... whether it be pro-life pro-gun well then we're getting back and since i mentioned pro-gun keep in mind that virtually all of the country's on both sides of the both oceans there that we would be align with have very strict gun controls
[03:04:45.268 --> 03:04:48.789]  And they're going to have votes on these boards with the future of the documents.
[03:04:48.869 --> 03:04:49.390]  Incredible.
[03:04:49.810 --> 03:04:50.370]  Absolutely.
[03:04:51.070 --> 03:04:55.092]  And so we're it right here, really.
[03:04:55.192 --> 03:04:57.452]  This is where the battle is going.
[03:04:57.493 --> 03:05:01.574]  And so people that think they're going to leave here and go to another country... No, this is it.
[03:05:01.754 --> 03:05:03.375]  William F. Jasper, we're out of time.
[03:05:04.375 --> 03:05:04.895]  Great job.
[03:05:04.915 --> 03:05:06.076]  TheNewAmerican.com.
[03:05:06.096 --> 03:05:06.696]  Thank you so much.
[03:05:11.533 --> 03:05:18.606]  Police departments and law enforcement agencies around the world have been using radar devices for a very long time.
