[00:00:09.554 --> 00:00:13.716]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:15.197]  You want answers?
[00:00:15.977 --> 00:00:17.878]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:17.898 --> 00:00:21.160]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.802]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.962 --> 00:00:32.485]  You want to know why we're losing control of our society and it's becoming a massive tyranny?
[00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:33.946]  By every metric.
[00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.812]  Mega's reason is television and the laziness of the general public.
[00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:43.276]  The establishment basically exacerbates it, rides it, surfs it.
[00:00:44.037 --> 00:00:47.640]  But at the end of the day, you want to know the problem, you want to know why we're in so much trouble?
[00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.301]  Look in the mirror.
[00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:53.745]  In fact, can we intro the next segment with the V for Vendetta piece we have?
[00:00:54.626 --> 00:00:55.787]  I know why you did it.
[00:00:56.448 --> 00:00:57.208]  You were scared.
[00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.790]  Why shouldn't you be?
[00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:03.057]  Terrorism, biological warfare, and more.
[00:01:03.577 --> 00:01:05.318]  And the government offered you security.
[00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:08.721]  All you had to do was stay silent and submit, and so you did.
[00:01:09.782 --> 00:01:12.544]  But now you've lost every basic freedom you have, and you're not safe.
[00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:21.830]  You're getting more and more unsafe every day, because those that give up liberty will only get horrible degradation, slavery, and tyranny.
[00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:25.173]  To paraphrase and expand on what V was saying,
[00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:33.712]  Mark Dice has another video, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:34.813 --> 00:01:35.413]  Video.
[00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:39.015]  Some Americans think Martin Luther King just died.
[00:01:40.716 --> 00:01:46.360]  And I talk to people with PhDs and stuff, and they are amazed.
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.784]  PhDs in psychology, sociology, astrophysics, you name it.
[00:01:53.685 --> 00:01:56.486]  And they'll be amazed that I even know anything about their field.
[00:01:57.547 --> 00:01:58.728]  Or that I'm trying to show off.
[00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.619]  It's just so interesting.
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.280]  And I'm a generalist.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.641]  I have general knowledge of all sorts of things.
[00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.202]  It's not because I'm a show-off or something.
[00:02:11.042 --> 00:02:13.983]  I'm not probably that smart at the end of the day.
[00:02:15.723 --> 00:02:20.825]  When you think of egghead smart, mathematician smart, but I am street smart.
[00:02:21.945 --> 00:02:24.065]  And if you're street smart, you want to know knowledge.
[00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:29.407]  Even if you're a sociopath, knowing how things work can make you very rich.
[00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:34.548]  In whatever endeavor you're involved in.
[00:02:35.368 --> 00:02:38.169]  Culturally rich, financially rich, spiritually rich.
[00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:44.773]  And I look at this video we're going to play in the next segment, the audio for radio listeners.
[00:02:46.593 --> 00:02:49.975]  Radio listeners can go to infowars.com forward slash show to find the free video feed.
[00:02:50.395 --> 00:02:52.036]  We got Mark coming on middle of the next hour.
[00:02:54.197 --> 00:02:56.078]  And Mark just goes out there for like 30 minutes.
[00:02:56.118 --> 00:02:57.979]  He doesn't need to stay out there all day to get idiots.
[00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.581]  Who think that Martin Luther King was the first man to walk on the moon and stuff like that.
[00:03:03.646 --> 00:03:04.246]  I'm not joking.
[00:03:05.587 --> 00:03:08.369]  This is the way the general public is.
[00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:17.055]  So you see a headline like this, and you know why this is happening.
[00:03:17.916 --> 00:03:23.739]  No, that's not a Weekly Standard or Washington Times conservative headline.
[00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:24.580]  That's Reuters.
[00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:36.938]  Here's another nice article out of the Japan Times.
[00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:41.601]  Richest 1% will hold half of world wealth in 2016.
[00:03:42.141 --> 00:03:43.122]  Oxfam says.
[00:03:43.142 --> 00:03:48.805]  That's the Oxfam global charity breaking it down in the name of Switzerland.
[00:03:50.686 --> 00:03:54.788]  And I'm going to decipher why this is happening and why it's going to get a lot worse.
[00:03:54.828 --> 00:03:56.309]  I mean, we all know the basics.
[00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:57.030]  Globalism.
[00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.011]  Centralized rig games.
[00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:00.372]  But you go look at the
[00:04:01.397 --> 00:04:02.878]  Top 1% of the 1%?
[00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.940]  They've got something like 65% of that wealth.
[00:04:09.081 --> 00:04:09.801]  So let's be clear.
[00:04:10.962 --> 00:04:13.403]  Well over a third of global wealth.
[00:04:14.804 --> 00:04:16.885]  I forget the precise number, it's something like that.
[00:04:16.905 --> 00:04:22.368]  Guys, will you Google, uh, ultra-rich have over a third of the world's wealth?
[00:04:24.158 --> 00:04:37.266]  I want to say it's 40-something percent, because they always just say 1% to confuse people, but that top tiny little percent of the 1%, you can look up the numbers, they hold almost all of it, and then they're waging war on the middle class.
[00:04:40.088 --> 00:04:40.548]  When you look at
[00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:46.554]  The Dutch and British royalty, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, people like Warren Buffett, Bill Gates.
[00:04:47.074 --> 00:04:48.416]  I mean, they're the ones.
[00:04:48.576 --> 00:04:50.078]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.423]  And they're funding ending free market.
[00:04:53.443 --> 00:04:56.767]  Well, yeah, they're pulling up the ladder to the hot air balloon they're already on.
[00:04:57.168 --> 00:04:58.810]  They don't want us on the hot air balloon.
[00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.452]  They're kicking everybody off of it.
[00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:12.242]  Sold out for weeks through the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[00:05:12.543 --> 00:05:22.530]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.155]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:35.659]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:44.085]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[00:05:44.505 --> 00:05:47.287]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:05:47.587 --> 00:05:48.748]  No needles, no injections.
[00:05:49.128 --> 00:05:50.429]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:51.429]  Try it for yourself.
[00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.670]  Discover the secret.
[00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.810]  Secret 12.
[00:05:54.111 --> 00:05:56.173]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.
[00:05:56.453 --> 00:06:02.879]  Secure yours today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.343]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:06:08.084 --> 00:06:14.369]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:19.374]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance
[00:06:19.574 --> 00:06:23.501]  To create superior vitality in males and females.

[00:06:33.373 --> 00:06:36.875]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:06:37.035 --> 00:06:40.998]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:42.779]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:50.685]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:06:50.965 --> 00:06:51.805]  But for how long?
[00:06:52.106 --> 00:06:58.350]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.552]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:10.036]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:07:10.136 --> 00:07:12.278]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:07:12.458 --> 00:07:17.563]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:07:17.743 --> 00:07:22.707]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:07:22.907 --> 00:07:25.949]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:30.091]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:34.553]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:07:34.633 --> 00:07:44.659]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:47.380]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.941]  There are of course those who do not want us to stop.
[00:08:10.111 --> 00:08:11.152]  Let me think, just let me think.
[00:08:32.383 --> 00:08:37.184]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:08:37.204 --> 00:08:38.184]  You decided, sir.
[00:08:38.244 --> 00:08:39.164]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:08:39.184 --> 00:08:40.585]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:08:40.825 --> 00:08:42.825]  Cruelty and injustice.
[00:08:42.945 --> 00:08:44.285]  Intolerance and oppression.
[00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:54.847]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and subverting your submission.
[00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:55.047]  Cameras.
[00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:55.567]  We need cameras.
[00:08:55.587 --> 00:08:56.308]  How did this happen?
[00:08:57.008 --> 00:08:57.788]  Who's to blame?
[00:08:58.769 --> 00:09:01.412]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:09:01.432 --> 00:09:03.334]  They will be held accountable.
[00:09:03.354 --> 00:09:09.220]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.150]  I know why you did it.
[00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.471]  I know you were afraid.
[00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:14.651]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:15.631]  War?
[00:09:15.911 --> 00:09:16.291]  Terror?
[00:09:16.551 --> 00:09:17.171]  Disease?
[00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:24.213]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:09:24.293 --> 00:09:30.054]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:09:30.674 --> 00:09:36.835]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:44.817]  This is a war.
[00:09:45.257 --> 00:09:46.238]  It's happening now.
[00:09:47.079 --> 00:09:48.901]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:09:49.482 --> 00:09:51.284]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:09:52.085 --> 00:09:53.546]  We are the resistance.
[00:09:53.987 --> 00:09:55.869]  We are the Infowar.
[00:09:57.691 --> 00:09:58.952]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:09:59.012 --> 00:10:03.256]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Monday, the 19th day of January, 2015.
[00:10:07.028 --> 00:10:14.094]  Mark Dice, documentary filmmaker, best-selling author, political analyst, media analyst, will be joining us.
[00:10:14.534 --> 00:10:15.395]  He's done it again.
[00:10:15.415 --> 00:10:20.279]  The video is on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:10:20.339 --> 00:10:21.961]  He joins us in the middle of the next hour.
[00:10:21.981 --> 00:10:24.743]  There's a new video.
[00:10:24.883 --> 00:10:30.488]  Americans think Martin Luther King just died and was the first African-American to walk on the moon.
[00:10:32.571 --> 00:10:35.053]  These are not cherry-picked from idiot Californians.
[00:10:35.813 --> 00:10:37.334]  These are liberals.
[00:10:39.095 --> 00:10:40.716]  We're able to do the same thing in Austin.
[00:10:41.557 --> 00:10:48.602]  The so-called trendy liberal is so stupid, so uninformed, it boggles the brain.
[00:10:49.762 --> 00:10:51.964]  And again, I use the term they would call themselves liberals.
[00:10:52.284 --> 00:10:59.609]  These are TV-head trendy fascist supporters who are dumber than a sack of rocks.
[00:11:02.557 --> 00:11:05.859]  Now, mainline Republicans aren't much better, I'll be honest with you.
[00:11:06.819 --> 00:11:10.681]  But at least they want private property and the right to self-defense and family.
[00:11:16.264 --> 00:11:22.287]  They're silly and they're ignorant, but they've got guts and guts is enough to rip off, one more time, full metal jacket.
[00:11:26.929 --> 00:11:28.030]  But these people are scary.
[00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:29.711]  I've sent my reporters out in Austin
[00:11:30.762 --> 00:11:39.225]  To go to the trendy areas and people that brag that they've got degrees in chemistry want to ban dihydrogen monoxide on tape and then start hitting on Leanne McAdoo.
[00:11:40.126 --> 00:11:41.526]  Yeah, I've got a degree in chemistry.
[00:11:41.546 --> 00:11:43.947]  I agree we need to ban dihydrogen monoxide.
[00:11:44.627 --> 00:11:46.268]  That's water, of course, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:53.411]  We use that as an illustration of... Carbon dioxide sounds scary like carbon monoxide that'll kill you.
[00:11:54.311 --> 00:11:58.673]  Carbon dioxide is what plants live off of and then they put off oxygen for us.
[00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:05.985]  We had a caller though last week that brought up a point that is a concern for fossil fuel burning.
[00:12:06.746 --> 00:12:10.971]  That it basically destroys oxygen when you burn stuff.
[00:12:11.011 --> 00:12:11.852]  That is a good point.
[00:12:12.212 --> 00:12:13.734]  And oxygen levels are dropping.
[00:12:14.154 --> 00:12:19.961]  But see, don't ever expect any real environmental angle to come out because special interests don't want that.
[00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:22.664]  Genetic engineering, overfishing, stuff like that.
[00:12:24.318 --> 00:12:24.979]  Nanotech.
[00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:34.645]  I'm not an obstructionist, I just, most major scientists that are involved in this say there's a good chance some of this is going to end up destroying us or coming awful darn close.
[00:12:35.286 --> 00:12:41.570]  Like the old legend of Atlantis developed some power source that blew up the whole island.
[00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:43.792]  Now I don't know if Atlantis was real.
[00:12:43.952 --> 00:12:47.634]  Plato said it was in a history book he wrote that's incredibly accurate.
[00:12:48.415 --> 00:12:51.037]  Plato said they had batteries with electricity.
[00:12:52.247 --> 00:12:55.689]  People didn't know if it was true until about 200 years ago when they found a bunch of them in Greece.
[00:12:56.429 --> 00:12:58.170]  They since found them in Rome and Spain.
[00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.591]  Over 2,000 years old.
[00:13:01.292 --> 00:13:02.492]  But I'm digressing.
[00:13:02.852 --> 00:13:03.353]  Excuse me.
[00:13:04.793 --> 00:13:07.215]  We are headed the way Atlantis went.
[00:13:08.715 --> 00:13:13.898]  So I don't know if Atlantis was real, but Atlantis is probably just about ready to happen.
[00:13:16.819 --> 00:13:19.381]  I want to have a controlled Atlantis.
[00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.411]  A controlled new Atlantis.
[00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:25.233]  And now that's high-level Illuminati talk right there.
[00:13:26.374 --> 00:13:28.135]  They say they want the new Atlantis.
[00:13:28.295 --> 00:13:29.756]  I see them building the new hell.
[00:13:30.997 --> 00:13:32.158]  I'd like humanity to make it.
[00:13:32.398 --> 00:13:33.819]  I'd like us to have advanced technologies.
[00:13:34.039 --> 00:13:40.164]  I'd like my children and grandchildren and their children to live with your children in the future and have access to all that and not kill each other mindlessly.
[00:13:42.245 --> 00:13:46.188]  Instead, I see the opposite of the Atlantis society.
[00:13:47.352 --> 00:13:49.434]  The good things of the fabled Atlantis.
[00:13:50.074 --> 00:13:57.140]  No war, peace, high technology, people reportedly lived hundreds of years, longer than they do now.
[00:13:57.741 --> 00:14:04.366]  Whether you believe that fable or not, whether it's based in some truth, the legend has some kernel to it.
[00:14:06.007 --> 00:14:15.175]  We have the Elysium of Atlantis within our grasp, the golden fields of Elysium.
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:24.644]  are within our grasp, and the elite have made the decision that you and I will not have access to that.
[00:14:27.105 --> 00:14:40.352]  They behave and operate as if we don't exist anymore, as if we don't matter, as if we're bugs to be swept out of the way, as Ray Kurzweil said, you may not take the brain chips and merge with the computers,
[00:14:41.465 --> 00:14:51.067]  We may allow you to live, or we may just step on you like a bug, because our intelligence will be like that of a god, compared to man today, or that of a human to a roach.
[00:14:52.087 --> 00:14:53.688]  I'm paraphrasing his quote, you can look it up.
[00:14:55.328 --> 00:14:56.928]  And that's a popular refrain.
[00:14:57.749 --> 00:15:02.790]  They will achieve godhead, and if you try to get in the way of it, they will kill you!
[00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.490]  You can say, well, that's not gonna happen.
[00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:06.090]  Really?
[00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.211]  I don't care whether it's Peter Thiel,
[00:15:09.221 --> 00:15:10.061]  Or Ted Turner.
[00:15:10.601 --> 00:15:12.482]  They're all obsessed with life extension.
[00:15:12.962 --> 00:15:16.763]  They're all obsessed with one world government and merging with cybernetic technologies.
[00:15:17.023 --> 00:15:19.424]  And why wouldn't they be obsessed with it?
[00:15:20.224 --> 00:15:26.586]  Everything that Galton envisioned in 1855 has basically been realized.
[00:15:28.866 --> 00:15:38.429]  So I gotta hand it to the British Royal Family and the Rothschilds that put their money behind the Galton plan that all major modern sciences now basically come out of.
[00:15:39.448 --> 00:15:41.510]  He didn't just invent biometrics and eugenics.
[00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:51.560]  He basically started the whole program because he had the funding over the British Royal Academy, the most powerful academy in the world then and probably now.
[00:15:54.946 --> 00:16:03.633]  And our world is, to a great extent, the competition between free humanity and what we've built and what the globalists have built or hijacked that we built.
[00:16:03.973 --> 00:16:10.318]  So there's two parallel systems operating, but now the technocracy is finally on its legs.
[00:16:10.838 --> 00:16:11.939]  It's not a baby anymore.
[00:16:12.619 --> 00:16:14.981]  It's a 14-year-old man.
[00:16:15.982 --> 00:16:22.627]  And it's about to be a 20-year-old man and then a 40-year-old man in its prime that is ready to go.
[00:16:24.369 --> 00:16:30.993]  And free humanity is in a poisoned scooper in the ditch, rolling around vomiting, basically.
[00:16:31.794 --> 00:16:36.357]  While right next to us is growing the powerful force that is going to strangle us.
[00:16:39.138 --> 00:16:47.924]  And in the scheme of time, if you want the allegory, the 14-year-old is walking across the street to where we're in the ditch, and every step he takes, he's a year older and bigger.
[00:16:49.545 --> 00:16:52.627]  And by the time he gets to us, we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:16:54.588 --> 00:16:56.009]  And he's already gotten to us.
[00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.650]  We're obsessed.
[00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.592]  We're being programmed by the iPhones, the little computers that spy on us and track everything we do.
[00:17:01.573 --> 00:17:03.034]  The grid's already gone in our houses.
[00:17:03.374 --> 00:17:04.575]  We're already eating the GMO.
[00:17:04.835 --> 00:17:06.317]  The chemicals are being added to our food.
[00:17:06.357 --> 00:17:09.639]  We're being manipulated and controlled all on record.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.841]  They admit the entire plan.
[00:17:13.862 --> 00:17:16.504]  And they think the public is so stupid, we won't wake up to it.
[00:17:19.466 --> 00:17:21.608]  And I'm going to tie all this in today
[00:17:23.868 --> 00:17:28.952]  With middle class decline looms over final years of Obama presidency.
[00:17:29.292 --> 00:17:31.234]  Gotta get rid of that middle class.
[00:17:31.294 --> 00:17:31.894]  They're uppity.
[00:17:32.555 --> 00:17:42.302]  They are a stepping stone for the poor to become lower middle class, middle class, upper middle class, nouveau riche, wealthy.
[00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:44.965]  Established.
[00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:49.208]  So the great consolidation is now happening.
[00:17:50.543 --> 00:17:57.266]  And it is the one-tenth of one percent, or roughly 6,000 elitist and less than 20 families.
[00:17:58.726 --> 00:18:08.951]  In Henry Kissinger's own organization's analysis, superclass, written by the head of the Kissinger group at the time, Rothkopf, and I agree with this analysis, 6,000 superclass.
[00:18:09.231 --> 00:18:14.193]  We did the math, it's something like zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, what was it, .42?
[00:18:14.533 --> 00:18:18.995]  It's not one percent, it's a fraction of one percent.
[00:18:20.489 --> 00:18:39.921]  That is waging all-out jihad, all-out crusade, an all-out holy war on any independent system, the family, any independent wealth, anything private that you don't want known, that's got to be known.
[00:18:40.421 --> 00:18:44.884]  This is a full domination, a usurpation, a conquering.
[00:18:47.946 --> 00:18:49.227]  We face an organized
[00:18:50.598 --> 00:18:58.383]  Scientific takeover that, as I've said, might as well be a deep space alien attack.
[00:19:00.805 --> 00:19:08.491]  If I was an advanced species and I wanted to take over the planet and just kind of get rid of humans without wrecking everything in a big war.
[00:19:08.991 --> 00:19:15.716]  If you friendly attacked seven million people, even if you had super advanced technology, it'd tear everything up with the humans fighting in their death throes.
[00:19:16.117 --> 00:19:27.986]  But if you took them over this way with compromised leaders, a they-live scenario, poison the water, the food, the culture, get kids addicted to computers, interfacing, proto-matrix into matrix,
[00:19:29.006 --> 00:19:30.869]  Uh, the plan would actually work.
[00:19:31.689 --> 00:19:35.254]  And I'm not saying it's deep space aliens, like David Icke's saying.
[00:19:36.561 --> 00:19:37.562]  Are you saying interdimensional?
[00:19:38.022 --> 00:19:38.882]  I'm not saying it's that.
[00:19:38.942 --> 00:19:40.483]  It just might as well be that.
[00:19:40.563 --> 00:19:41.944]  I mean, that's what we're facing.
[00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:43.265]  Total extermination.
[00:19:43.485 --> 00:19:48.608]  But first, they're going to exterminate our minds, our will, because they have metaphysical rules.
[00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:55.231]  They are not allowed to kill a conscious human who hasn't joined their club or who hasn't agreed to their program.
[00:19:55.251 --> 00:19:56.132]  It's a metaphysical rule.
[00:19:56.552 --> 00:20:02.596]  They have to either get us to join them so we can be destroyed or have us destroy ourselves through choices so we're no longer human.
[00:20:02.616 --> 00:20:03.256]  Then they can kill us.
[00:20:04.716 --> 00:20:06.797]  What's the best way to keep secret from somebody?
[00:20:07.317 --> 00:20:11.238]  Well, you give them something that they want so bad that they don't care what you're hiding.
[00:20:11.578 --> 00:20:16.539]  The year is 2007 and 20% of the state of California is employed in real estate.
[00:20:16.839 --> 00:20:21.980]  We live in a capitalistic nation of kings and prey upon the greed of the selfish pawns.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.761]  Based on a true story.
[00:20:23.981 --> 00:20:28.242]  We created the American dream where everybody could qualify for one of these loans.
[00:20:33.208 --> 00:20:36.569]  Worried about getting sick and feeling terrible for days or even weeks?
[00:20:36.869 --> 00:20:39.410]  You need Imudine for a healthy immune system.
[00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:42.651]  Why get sick and bother with products that just don't work?

[00:21:57.398 --> 00:21:57.738]  Silver Bullet.
[00:22:02.902 --> 00:22:09.084]  Usually, the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[00:22:09.645 --> 00:22:13.406]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[00:22:14.026 --> 00:22:17.007]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[00:22:17.528 --> 00:22:18.128]  Not fun!
[00:22:18.668 --> 00:22:26.471]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[00:22:27.071 --> 00:22:31.833]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[00:22:32.173 --> 00:22:32.973]  My name is Errol.

[00:22:34.854 --> 00:22:37.256]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[00:22:37.436 --> 00:22:44.899]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:51.343]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[00:22:51.583 --> 00:22:52.023]  Call 888-988-3325.

[00:24:07.315 --> 00:24:09.836]  Everybody knows the dice are loaded.
[00:24:10.716 --> 00:24:11.656]  Everybody knows.
[00:24:11.856 --> 00:24:15.518]  Everybody knows that the dice are loaded.
[00:24:16.138 --> 00:24:19.659]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[00:24:19.939 --> 00:24:20.680]  Everybody knows.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.441]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[00:24:25.701 --> 00:24:29.923]  Everybody knows the good guys... Who are we fighting, though?
[00:24:32.223 --> 00:24:35.964]  Who prosecutes the war?
[00:24:36.004 --> 00:24:37.304]  Who are the social engineers?
[00:24:37.664 --> 00:24:38.785]  And what's their goal?
[00:24:39.845 --> 00:24:43.365]  We know there's a global private corporate shadow government now coming out in the open.
[00:24:43.786 --> 00:24:44.566]  Who runs it?
[00:24:44.626 --> 00:24:45.426]  What do they want?
[00:24:45.946 --> 00:24:56.768]  Oh, I've gone and researched who they are and what they want and they're quite public about their plan for you and I and let me just say it's not a very nice plan.
[00:24:58.356 --> 00:25:02.961]  And I don't know why the average person gets violently angry if their neighbor's dog craps in their yard.
[00:25:04.223 --> 00:25:07.586]  Or if you catch the neighbor's teenager stealing a six-pack of beer out of your garage.
[00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:16.356]  I remember one time I had neighbors down the street whose dad's gotten a huge fistfight because one of the teenagers stole beer out of his garage.
[00:25:17.177 --> 00:25:18.098]  The police came, everything.
[00:25:18.779 --> 00:25:19.660]  I look back on that.
[00:25:20.848 --> 00:25:28.352]  Would grown men fight when the globalists write books about how they put poison in the water to brain damage and lower their children's IQ?
[00:25:28.712 --> 00:25:29.293]  No!
[00:25:29.413 --> 00:25:30.353]  It's the government!
[00:25:30.634 --> 00:25:32.695]  Let's just trust them when they're doing that.
[00:25:32.715 --> 00:25:34.556]  See, that's what I mean.
[00:25:35.416 --> 00:25:37.497]  We're just here comfortably taking it all.
[00:25:38.058 --> 00:25:45.602]  I'm gonna break down the real elite, what their plan is, how it ties into the middle class, disappearing, according to Reuters, under Obama.
[00:25:48.384 --> 00:25:48.944]  We'll look at
[00:25:51.055 --> 00:25:53.796]  How that ties into this Japan Times article.
[00:25:54.696 --> 00:25:57.377]  Richest 1% will hold half of global wealth by 2016.
[00:25:58.977 --> 00:26:02.058]  It's a tiny percentage of that that actually holds half the wealth.
[00:26:02.398 --> 00:26:04.918]  And if you count all the derivatives, well, they hold a lot more than that.
[00:26:04.938 --> 00:26:13.441]  So we're going to be breaking that down and tying it into a special report video up on InfoWars.com by Mark Dice.
[00:26:13.561 --> 00:26:15.961]  Some Americans think Martin Luther King just died.
[00:26:16.441 --> 00:26:18.582]  First African American to walk on the moon.
[00:26:19.946 --> 00:26:27.673]  Remember Angela Merkel, the Deutsch Chancellor?
[00:26:30.335 --> 00:26:42.186]  Well, the German Chancellor marched days after she tried to ban anti-open borders, anti-globalist, anti-Germans having to pay for all the welfare of the illegals.
[00:26:43.347 --> 00:26:46.670]  Germany is a first stop for criminals.
[00:26:47.924 --> 00:27:01.593]  Aggravated criminals around the world are allowed into Germany by the socialists and organized into brigades to then become the social workers and rule over the Germans, who are too prideful to be basically government minions.
[00:27:05.596 --> 00:27:08.618]  Well, German police ban anti-Islamic rowdy
[00:27:09.642 --> 00:27:14.004]  Again, German police ban anti-Islamic rally citing terror threat.
[00:27:14.324 --> 00:27:23.609]  French news agency, for your safety, the nationalist groups are not allowed to go out with their German flags and say that they don't want completely open borders.
[00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:27.750]  And so they had riot police come out and break it up and stop it.
[00:27:28.491 --> 00:27:29.631]  There you go!
[00:27:30.572 --> 00:27:37.055]  Yes, stand up for free speech of Charlie Hebdo when France and other countries are banning free speech under EU.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.522]  First, it's don't deny the Holocaust.
[00:27:41.202 --> 00:27:46.747]  And sure, that's unsavory, but people should be allowed to deny it if they want to.
[00:27:47.528 --> 00:27:49.309]  And now they're saying don't deny global warming.
[00:27:49.349 --> 00:27:51.871]  Well, global warming is natural.
[00:27:52.132 --> 00:27:52.872]  So is cooling.
[00:27:53.793 --> 00:27:54.894]  The only constant is change.
[00:27:54.934 --> 00:27:56.235]  Now they call it climate change.
[00:27:56.515 --> 00:27:58.337]  If you deny that, they want you arrested.
[00:27:58.617 --> 00:28:00.419]  And fines are actually being levied in Europe.
[00:28:01.564 --> 00:28:04.607]  Because they have a right in Europe not to be flooded, you see.
[00:28:05.167 --> 00:28:09.731]  And not to die in a catastrophic world calamity because of the climate.
[00:28:10.252 --> 00:28:16.177]  And so, they're moving towards restricting free speech across the board and calling for Lord Monckton's arrest.
[00:28:17.618 --> 00:28:21.482]  Well, now German police ban anti-Islamic rally, citing terror threat.
[00:28:22.182 --> 00:28:25.243]  Notice how AFP bills it like it's anti-Islamic.
[00:28:25.263 --> 00:28:33.386]  The truth is it's pretty mainline right-wing nationalist, getting very popular, winning a lot of seats in the German Reichstag or their parliament.
[00:28:34.886 --> 00:28:47.190]  German police banned a planned rally by anti-Islamic PEG-IDA movement and other public open-air gatherings in the eastern city of Dresden Monday, citing a terrorist threat.
[00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.711]  It's for their safety.
[00:28:53.584 --> 00:28:59.089]  It's quote, patriotic Europeans against the Islamicization of the country.
[00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:07.997]  And they, accident, and they protest open borders and criminals being brought into the country.
[00:29:08.477 --> 00:29:09.078]  Sounds familiar.
[00:29:11.547 --> 00:29:18.011]  They've got Democratic Congressmen out, Gutierrez and others today, saying it's a Shelma moment to open the borders to all of Latin America.
[00:29:18.252 --> 00:29:20.333]  Really, I can't go to Latin America and get free health care.
[00:29:20.753 --> 00:29:22.574]  I can't go there and get in-state tuition.
[00:29:22.855 --> 00:29:23.555]  This is pure bull.
[00:29:23.575 --> 00:29:24.636]  We're going bankrupt.
[00:29:25.116 --> 00:29:29.459]  But they make it, oh, you're anti-Latin American because you don't want totally open borders.
[00:29:30.119 --> 00:29:30.660]  Absolutely.
[00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.461]  I don't want to be Mexico or Guatemala.
[00:29:32.721 --> 00:29:33.842]  Have you been down there?
[00:29:33.862 --> 00:29:39.366]  I wish nothing but great future to all those people.
[00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:43.033]  Like the Rod Stewart song, Forever Young, man.
[00:29:43.333 --> 00:29:44.375]  That's what I want for everybody.
[00:29:45.095 --> 00:29:48.860]  But I'm here to tell you, I'm not gonna pay for everything because I'm white.
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.001]  I'm not guilty.
[00:29:50.281 --> 00:29:51.883]  I hadn't done jack squat.
[00:29:52.924 --> 00:29:53.825]  We're on the march.
[00:29:54.326 --> 00:29:55.928]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.849 --> 00:29:59.532]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.706 --> 00:30:04.946]  Another major health threat.
[00:30:04.966 --> 00:30:09.867]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:30:09.947 --> 00:30:12.588]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:30:12.628 --> 00:30:19.390]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:22.510]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:25.591]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:30:25.611 --> 00:30:27.591]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:30:27.631 --> 00:30:30.472]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:30:30.572 --> 00:30:36.054]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:30:36.274 --> 00:30:39.776]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.

[00:33:28.982 --> 00:33:33.204]  We sold out all our freedom for Hollywood Babylon.
[00:33:35.125 --> 00:33:44.671]  While we know who's in People Magazine, but we don't know what the government's doing with all the surveillance data they're stealing on us.
[00:33:47.924 --> 00:33:50.066]  Hollywood, Babylon.
[00:33:53.868 --> 00:33:55.389]  Let's go ahead and go to a clip from August 28, 1963.
[00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:59.512]  I Have a Dream, Martin Luther King.
[00:33:59.772 --> 00:34:08.978]  How different is this from what we see from the Justice Department and George Soros spending $33 million to start race war and a war with the police in America?
[00:34:08.998 --> 00:34:17.064]  I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up
[00:34:18.777 --> 00:34:20.939]  Live out the true meaning of its dreams.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:27.865]  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.
[00:34:28.465 --> 00:34:39.034]  I have a dream, that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and sons of former slave owners,
[00:34:40.828 --> 00:34:44.991]  Will they be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood?
[00:34:45.011 --> 00:34:46.212]  I have a dream.
[00:34:46.712 --> 00:34:57.060]  My four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.701]  I have a dream!
[00:35:02.023 --> 00:35:02.684]  That part was key.
[00:35:12.051 --> 00:35:37.192]  Well, these shall overcome certainly hasn't happened yet and if you look at what the government has done wedding black women to the state blacks are obviously by every metric and every statistic
[00:35:39.551 --> 00:35:51.097]  worse off under the invisible or foggy tyranny of the Great Society than they were under the open tyranny of segregation and that oppressive system.
[00:35:51.877 --> 00:35:55.859]  Because an enemy and an attack that is open will make you strong.
[00:35:57.079 --> 00:36:02.942]  An enemy that's creeping and cold-blooded is the plague, to paraphrase Cicero.
[00:36:04.383 --> 00:36:05.403]  The traitor is the plague.
[00:36:07.164 --> 00:36:08.785]  And by every real metric,
[00:36:10.356 --> 00:36:14.157]  Health metrics, family metrics, economic metrics.
[00:36:15.218 --> 00:36:19.619]  On average, black people are worse off than they were in 1963.
[00:36:20.699 --> 00:36:22.400]  Go look the numbers up.
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:24.580]  It's incredible.
[00:36:25.961 --> 00:36:30.102]  And under Obama, in just seven years, double the unemployment rate.
[00:36:31.643 --> 00:36:32.623]  You know who else is in trouble?
[00:36:32.643 --> 00:36:33.603]  The middle class, period.
[00:36:34.704 --> 00:36:38.665]  No matter what color you are, the American dream is in trouble.
[00:36:40.416 --> 00:36:40.996]  More debt?
[00:36:43.898 --> 00:36:48.119]  110 million people not in the workforce?
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.700]  47 million people on food stamps?
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.261]  Another 10 million or so on supplemental food stamps?
[00:36:53.422 --> 00:36:54.502]  That's almost 60 million.
[00:36:55.783 --> 00:36:56.323]  That's double.
[00:36:57.984 --> 00:37:02.186]  And you don't want to blame Obama, but he's the figurehead for the dumbed-down public.
[00:37:02.666 --> 00:37:06.768]  For new listeners that tune in that don't understand what's going on, I gotta say Obama.
[00:37:07.488 --> 00:37:09.049]  Because then they know what I'm talking about.
[00:37:10.558 --> 00:37:11.998]  I talk about shadow elite.
[00:37:12.018 --> 00:37:13.759]  I talk about social engineers.
[00:37:13.799 --> 00:37:16.099]  They've been conditioned that doesn't exist.
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:25.581]  But let me tell you what's getting liberals' attention when they get cut now under Obamacare from 40 hours to 25 hours.
[00:37:26.181 --> 00:37:29.762]  That's happened to more than 14 million people in the last two years since that kicked in.
[00:37:31.222 --> 00:37:36.423]  And now, here's the headline, Obamacare penalty may come as a shock at tax time, Washington Times.
[00:37:38.578 --> 00:37:39.698]  Gonna garnish your wages?
[00:37:39.718 --> 00:37:41.119]  Gonna keep your tax refund?
[00:37:41.479 --> 00:37:43.079]  Gonna grab your bank account?
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.020]  Remember, they promised you that wasn't gonna happen.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.581]  And everybody said, well, why is the IRS the enforcer?
[00:37:50.621 --> 00:37:51.181]  It's right here in the bill.
[00:37:51.481 --> 00:37:52.441]  Shut up, racist!
[00:37:54.042 --> 00:37:55.622]  Well, the public knows that word, racist.
[00:37:56.903 --> 00:37:58.423]  They don't know who Martin Luther King is now.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.521]  People don't know who Chuck Yeager is.
[00:38:01.601 --> 00:38:03.042]  People don't know who George Washington is.
[00:38:03.102 --> 00:38:03.583]  I'm not kidding.
[00:38:04.203 --> 00:38:10.648]  You see the different polls out every year from college students and high school students where 40-something percent can't name one founding father.
[00:38:10.668 --> 00:38:14.870]  Or 70-something percent can't name the three branches of government.
[00:38:15.191 --> 00:38:17.192]  I mean, the numbers vary, but you've all seen those.
[00:38:19.254 --> 00:38:24.237]  But let me tell you, they can tell you who the quarterback is for the New England Patriots.
[00:38:26.859 --> 00:38:29.521]  If they're from Florida, they can tell you who the quarterback is for the Gators.
[00:38:30.916 --> 00:38:36.860]  And those very same people on an elevator or at a restaurant will say, hey, how about that Cowboys game?
[00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:38.462]  That was a bad, bad call, right?
[00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:39.963]  You know, I don't really watch football.
[00:38:40.343 --> 00:38:41.484]  You're some kind of idiot.
[00:38:41.744 --> 00:38:43.265]  You don't know Jack Squad, do you?
[00:38:44.506 --> 00:38:48.109]  No, I just know about the battle formations at the Battle of Waterloo.
[00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:50.731]  I know about the Rothschilds.
[00:38:50.771 --> 00:38:53.193]  I know about them crashing the stock market and taking over the British Empire.
[00:38:55.486 --> 00:39:08.153]  In 1815, and I know all about the Charter of the Federal Reserve, and I know all about Pratt House, and the CFR, and British Intelligence, and... I've had intelligence agencies from foreign governments and domestic come and visit me.
[00:39:08.953 --> 00:39:09.974]  I live in the real world, see?
[00:39:10.854 --> 00:39:11.955]  I don't live in football land.
[00:39:11.995 --> 00:39:12.335]  Sorry!
[00:39:12.475 --> 00:39:13.216]  I'm not very manly.
[00:39:16.077 --> 00:39:23.662]  I've just been visited by the Mossad, and the CIA, and British Intelligence, and the FBI, and the Secret Service, and Federal Marshals.
[00:39:25.985 --> 00:39:28.148]  I just break national news stories every week.
[00:39:28.889 --> 00:39:31.813]  I am the most listened to radio broadcast at the Pentagon.
[00:39:33.475 --> 00:39:35.197]  And I'm not bragging about Alex Jones.
[00:39:35.557 --> 00:39:39.663]  What I'm saying is, I live in the real world, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:41.277 --> 00:39:42.819]  And the real world listens.
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:49.365]  Not that I'm even perfect or have all the answers, but there's no other radio that even the establishment can tune into.
[00:39:49.886 --> 00:39:55.171]  Don't you think when you're an insider and know how things really work, it gets old watching CNN or Fox News?
[00:39:55.712 --> 00:40:01.838]  Don't you think it gets old seeing the twisting and not seeing representation of how stuff really works?
[00:40:02.018 --> 00:40:03.219]  Because that's how it really works.
[00:40:04.076 --> 00:40:07.917]  You've got less than one-tenth of one percent that really has half the wealth.
[00:40:08.377 --> 00:40:13.679]  And they're waging war on the middle class and pushing higher taxes when they themselves aren't exempt from it.
[00:40:13.699 --> 00:40:15.160]  And I'm going to break that down in a moment.
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:16.520]  It's a fact!
[00:40:20.101 --> 00:40:21.582]  They're pulling up the ladders.
[00:40:25.319 --> 00:40:26.440]  That everybody could get up.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.143]  They've decided prosperity is not the way to go.
[00:40:29.723 --> 00:40:31.885]  They've decided renaissance isn't the way to go.
[00:40:32.105 --> 00:40:37.630]  They've decided dark age, infighting, race war is the way to go.
[00:40:38.131 --> 00:40:45.878]  They've decided totalitarian management is the way to go because the future doesn't need us and the elite have made the decision.
[00:40:48.806 --> 00:41:02.612]  And so even though half of an American history textbook on average in public school is about wrongs done to minorities to make people guilty, so they can then be guilty and do what Democrats and Republicans tell them to do, or they'll be called racist.
[00:41:02.872 --> 00:41:15.238]  It's all there with just dumb, empty-headed kids, white kids to feel guilty, and minorities, who are the majority in most areas, to then feel wronged and race-conscious and hateful.
[00:41:17.022 --> 00:41:19.283]  To bring in a new management system of racism.
[00:41:22.225 --> 00:41:22.805]  Quite a trick.
[00:41:24.426 --> 00:41:28.028]  And to do that, they've had to dumb down the public.
[00:41:28.068 --> 00:41:29.528]  And they've done a fabulous job.
[00:41:30.789 --> 00:41:32.670]  Videos up on Infowars.com.
[00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:38.573]  Some Americans think Martin Luther King just died, that he was the first African American to walk on the moon.
[00:41:39.693 --> 00:41:52.999]  Almost three decades after Americans first observed Martin Luther King Day, some beachgoers in San Diego believe the civil rights leader only died recently, with others thinking King was the first African-American to walk on the moon.
[00:41:54.299 --> 00:41:57.320]  King was murdered on April 4th, 68, nearly 47 years ago.
[00:41:58.321 --> 00:42:07.945]  But when media analyst and author Mark Dice confronted San Diegans with the news that he had just passed away, the reaction
[00:42:09.482 --> 00:42:10.423]  Was not as expected.
[00:42:10.463 --> 00:42:11.003]  Yes, it was.
[00:42:11.844 --> 00:42:12.824]  These are not cherry-picked.
[00:42:12.844 --> 00:42:13.364]  He's coming on.
[00:42:13.384 --> 00:42:13.965]  We've talked to him.
[00:42:14.985 --> 00:42:16.046]  We don't need to cherry-pick either.
[00:42:16.106 --> 00:42:18.107]  It is shocking how dumb they are.
[00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:26.313]  They signed a petition to add birth control drugs to the water supply.
[00:42:26.333 --> 00:42:34.118]  Students at the University of California accepted abortion in a can of fruit juice drinks, endorsing 19th century communist ideologue
[00:42:34.949 --> 00:42:37.236]  Karl Marx is the President of the United States.
[00:42:37.256 --> 00:42:38.139]  These are past videos.
[00:42:38.681 --> 00:42:42.131]  Obama supporters signing a petition to eliminate free speech and the First Amendment.
[00:42:43.359 --> 00:42:45.660]  Signed a petition to repeal the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.
[00:42:46.201 --> 00:42:50.443]  Supported a move to end the right to remain silent by repealing the Fifth Amendment.
[00:42:50.723 --> 00:42:57.087]  They signed a petition to support post-birth abortion up to age three-year-olds making infanticide part of Obamacare.
[00:42:57.387 --> 00:42:59.028]  It actually is being promoted now for real.
[00:42:59.588 --> 00:43:04.091]  Signed a petition to support making euthanasia of senior citizens mandatory part of Obamacare.
[00:43:04.451 --> 00:43:09.114]  Actually, the author of it, Zekiel Emanuel, called for 75 and up to be terminated.
[00:43:10.134 --> 00:43:11.335]  Can anybody say Logan's Run?
[00:43:12.677 --> 00:43:14.458]  My mom's in that movie, I should ask her.
[00:43:14.498 --> 00:43:15.499]  Funny, she's in a scene.
[00:43:15.919 --> 00:43:23.904]  Supporting a move to release all illegal aliens from prison no matter what crime they have committed and then giving them free U.S.
[00:43:23.924 --> 00:43:24.585]  citizenship.
[00:43:25.565 --> 00:43:26.326]  That's already happening.
[00:43:27.026 --> 00:43:30.929]  Signed a petition to grant Obama immunity from all crimes he commits while in office.
[00:43:31.269 --> 00:43:36.673]  In another video, San Diegans also expressed their view that not liking Mexican food was racist form of bigotry.
[00:43:37.489 --> 00:43:48.354]  See, all they know, white, black, hispanic, asian, is to hate white people, even if they're white, and to hate anything pro-life, and to hate any form of freedom.
[00:43:48.954 --> 00:43:53.116]  Just like in Germany, that you are not allowed to go out and protest open borders.
[00:43:53.676 --> 00:43:54.717]  Anything else goes.
[00:43:57.378 --> 00:44:00.719]  But, free speech is banned, while the president marches for a free speech.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.401]  So let's go ahead and go to this video.
[00:44:07.581 --> 00:44:14.384]  Of the San Diego Airheads, thinking that Martin Luther King was the first black person to walk on the moon.
[00:44:14.424 --> 00:44:14.784]  Here it is.
[00:44:15.364 --> 00:44:19.366]  As you probably saw in the news, Martin Luther King passed away this morning.
[00:44:19.386 --> 00:44:22.527]  Aww, it's one of my favorite speeches.
[00:44:23.107 --> 00:44:26.669]  The Kennedy speech, his speech, and Lincoln, four score.
[00:44:27.651 --> 00:44:31.974]  Are you going to be going to the memorial for Martin Luther King?
[00:44:31.994 --> 00:44:32.955]  This is the first I heard about it.
[00:44:32.975 --> 00:44:33.916]  I didn't watch the news.
[00:44:33.976 --> 00:44:35.257]  I don't even know where it's going to be.
[00:44:35.317 --> 00:44:37.038]  Yeah, news just came.
[00:44:37.118 --> 00:44:41.522]  He just passed away this morning of a coronary age of 93.
[00:44:42.142 --> 00:44:44.164]  Oh, but that's not so bad.
[00:44:44.184 --> 00:44:44.844]  Made it to 93.
[00:44:44.904 --> 00:44:45.525]  That's good.
[00:44:46.245 --> 00:44:51.349]  Martin Luther King, the first African-American to walk on the moon, passed away this morning.
[00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:55.552]  Just getting people's reactions to his legacy for the black people.
[00:44:55.592 --> 00:44:56.412]  What can I say?
[00:44:56.493 --> 00:44:57.893]  He was a good man, no?
[00:44:58.414 --> 00:45:00.835]  I hope there's more people like him.
[00:45:01.015 --> 00:45:03.196]  A good role model for African American astronauts.
[00:45:03.216 --> 00:45:04.477]  For everybody, for everybody.
[00:45:05.718 --> 00:45:06.939]  That's a good person.
[00:45:07.779 --> 00:45:08.059]  Yeah.
[00:45:08.459 --> 00:45:08.639]  Alright.
[00:45:08.659 --> 00:45:10.700]  Do you think maybe they'll make a holiday for him?
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:11.641]  Maybe, you know?
[00:45:11.681 --> 00:45:12.201]  You never know.
[00:45:12.401 --> 00:45:13.182]  This world's crazy.
[00:45:13.322 --> 00:45:15.182]  They do a lot of crazy stuff.
[00:45:15.362 --> 00:45:17.583]  They may have a Martin Luther King holiday someday, right?
[00:45:17.624 --> 00:45:18.644]  Yeah, hopefully.
[00:45:18.684 --> 00:45:20.585]  To commemorate the astronauts.
[00:45:20.665 --> 00:45:21.745]  Hope we don't work that day too.
[00:45:21.965 --> 00:45:23.786]  Yeah, that's all that really matters.
[00:45:23.866 --> 00:45:24.807]  And they pay it.
[00:45:25.607 --> 00:45:31.931]  Martin Luther King, first African American to be put on Mount Rushmore, obviously a huge step in America.
[00:45:34.072 --> 00:45:36.733]  How much more do we have to go until we're, you know?
[00:45:37.033 --> 00:45:37.274]  I know.
[00:45:37.654 --> 00:45:38.454]  I think a long ways.
[00:45:38.854 --> 00:45:53.122]  But wouldn't you agree, at least putting him, I mean, when they put him on the face of Mount Rushmore, when they put Martin Luther King on the face of Mount Rushmore, a huge step for American racial equality, wouldn't you say?
[00:45:53.563 --> 00:45:54.083]  I would say.
[00:45:54.721 --> 00:45:55.442]  Well, thank you very much.
[00:45:56.762 --> 00:46:08.691]  Martin Luther King, huge legacy for America, a favorite general in the Confederate Army, giving the Gettysburg Address, still played today.
[00:46:08.711 --> 00:46:16.176]  Any thoughts on how close we are to finally achieving the dream of eradicating racism?
[00:46:17.528 --> 00:46:18.169]  I have no idea.
[00:46:18.189 --> 00:46:24.972]  I mean, there's still stuff going on in different parts of the country, like the whole, what is that, Missouri thing?
[00:46:25.633 --> 00:46:26.373]  The Missouri thing?
[00:46:26.513 --> 00:46:31.135]  The police shooting, you know, that whole mess.
[00:46:31.175 --> 00:46:31.836]  I don't know, I mean...
[00:46:34.153 --> 00:46:37.435]  I think it's better than what it was, so we'll see, I guess.
[00:46:38.395 --> 00:46:46.700]  As you probably saw on the news, I don't know if you saw the news in the last hour or so, but Martin Luther King has passed away at the age of 93.
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.702]  I didn't see.
[00:46:50.102 --> 00:46:56.425]  We're just sort of getting people's opinions and looking at the legacy that he's left behind here.
[00:46:58.368 --> 00:47:01.929]  Any thoughts on what he's done for the country, how far we've come?
[00:47:02.149 --> 00:47:03.909]  He passed away.
[00:47:03.929 --> 00:47:06.990]  My thoughts are that he was a good man and I'm sorry he's passed away.
[00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:09.070]  We should all follow what he preached.
[00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:11.611]  That's my view.
[00:47:11.671 --> 00:47:16.072]  I mean, we lost a great civil rights leader this morning.
[00:47:16.092 --> 00:47:19.153]  Martin Luther King, dead at 93.
[00:47:20.053 --> 00:47:24.754]  Any thoughts on how far we've come from his original speech?
[00:47:27.052 --> 00:47:29.976]  We've come a ways, but we have a long way to go, I believe.
[00:47:29.996 --> 00:47:34.421]  Are you going to be watching the funeral services or maybe attending?
[00:47:35.379 --> 00:47:38.380]  I definitely won't be attending because funerals are very sad.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:38.761]  Yeah.
[00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:42.002]  But, uh... Possibly... We won't go to Martin Luther King's funeral then.
[00:47:42.022 --> 00:47:42.462]  No.
[00:47:42.502 --> 00:47:43.523]  Possibly may watch him.
[00:47:43.543 --> 00:47:46.504]  But maybe watch the memorial services on CNN or... Possibly.
[00:47:47.384 --> 00:47:50.926]  I would imagine we'll all be watching because we won't have a choice.
[00:47:50.966 --> 00:47:57.289]  The whole world will be watching Martin Luther King's funeral live on television.
[00:47:57.889 --> 00:47:58.149]  Right.
[00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:03.732]  I mean, as you probably saw on the news this morning, Martin Luther King passed away.
[00:48:04.392 --> 00:48:07.874]  So we're just getting people's opinions on... I don't know if that's true.
[00:48:07.934 --> 00:48:10.575]  He was, uh, yeah, dead at 93.
[00:48:12.135 --> 00:48:21.159]  And so just getting some soundbites on how far we've come to, you know, achieving the dream of eradicating racism.
[00:48:21.339 --> 00:48:22.260]  Eradicating racism.
[00:48:22.992 --> 00:48:27.033]  Well, I'm pretty sure he passed away a while ago, so... How did he die?
[00:48:27.053 --> 00:48:27.693]  Do you remember?
[00:48:28.173 --> 00:48:29.014]  I believe he was murdered.
[00:48:29.054 --> 00:48:29.814]  Oh, he was murdered.
[00:48:29.874 --> 00:48:30.394]  He was murdered.
[00:48:30.414 --> 00:48:31.754]  Well, thank you for knowing that.
[00:48:32.174 --> 00:48:32.534]  No problem.
[00:48:32.574 --> 00:48:33.395]  Appreciate that.
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.460]  Alright, that's Mark's latest.
[00:48:52.501 --> 00:48:54.281]  He joins us at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:48:58.263 --> 00:49:08.327]  We've got a clip from that famous speech back in 1963, on August 28th, where he says, judge people not on what color they are, but on what they stand for, basically.
[00:49:09.067 --> 00:49:18.571]  Now, if you look at political correctness, and you look at everything being about your sexual persuasion, what color you are, it's the opposite of a truly liberal society.
[00:49:19.602 --> 00:49:24.571]  In a liberal society, it's about what you stand for and who you are, and you're open to new ideas and you're tolerant.
[00:49:25.071 --> 00:49:29.118]  But it doesn't mean you put yourself in a group and then think as a group and operate as a group.
[00:49:29.419 --> 00:49:30.701]  That's called a cult.
[00:49:31.142 --> 00:49:33.366]  A gang-driven society.
[00:49:35.171 --> 00:49:45.516]  And George Soros, again, it came out in a report last week, we already told you this months ago, but it's in a big Washington Times report, he admits it, $33 million just to get the anti-police stuff going.
[00:49:46.056 --> 00:49:52.239]  Folks, the police, asset forfeiture seizures, shooting homeless people, there are bad cops out there, a lot of bad training, we fight all that.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.841]  But just hating the police in general, why would George Soros want that?
[00:49:57.202 --> 00:49:59.983]  Because they're beta testing civil war in this country.
[00:50:00.383 --> 00:50:01.924]  Soros just overthrew Ukraine.
[00:50:03.134 --> 00:50:07.697]  Regardless of what you think about Ukraine and Russia and Europe, Soros admits he was behind that.
[00:50:08.777 --> 00:50:09.518]  It's the same deal.
[00:50:09.778 --> 00:50:11.859]  They want racial division in this country.
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:15.321]  The public dumbed down, only looking at what color you are.
[00:50:15.682 --> 00:50:16.662]  And that's what this has turned into.
[00:50:16.962 --> 00:50:17.903]  Here's Martin Luther King.
[00:50:31.235 --> 00:50:31.535]  Absolutely.
[00:50:31.555 --> 00:50:42.668]  I'm going to tell you, as a news manager, I own this company, I don't, I mean, I don't care what color a reporter is, if they're tenacious, smart, love freedom, and will go out and cover interesting news.
[00:50:42.708 --> 00:50:45.671]  I mean, I literally could care less.
[00:50:47.513 --> 00:50:48.815]  I mean, how is that revolutionary?
[00:50:52.918 --> 00:51:01.344]  If I was politically correct, I should just hire people according to some type of, uh, you know, slot or something, uh, with, with quotas or something.
[00:51:01.364 --> 00:51:02.685]  I mean, that's just the opposite of freedom.
[00:51:02.946 --> 00:51:03.466]  We'll be right back.

[00:52:53.295 --> 00:52:55.416]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:55.436 --> 00:52:56.677]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk.
[00:53:07.364 --> 00:53:08.005]  We're good to go.
[00:53:27.179 --> 00:53:32.883]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:53:33.124 --> 00:53:35.906]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:53:36.286 --> 00:53:41.510]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:49.796]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:53:49.836 --> 00:53:50.037]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:53:50.117 --> 00:53:50.637]  Do business
[00:53:57.022 --> 00:54:13.747]  Alright, I'm going to start the next hour and really focus into an in-depth analysis report on why they're destroying the middle class, what it means, break down the numbers.
[00:54:27.745 --> 00:54:31.367]  Because the public thinks of things of either you're for the environment or you're against it.
[00:54:31.547 --> 00:54:33.928]  Or you're for the 1% or you're against it.
[00:54:34.768 --> 00:54:35.929]  Well, who is the 1%?
[00:54:36.489 --> 00:54:43.012]  It's a percentage of 1% that has basically half the wealth through fraud in almost every case.
[00:54:44.432 --> 00:54:48.514]  They're insider, crony, government alliance deals.
[00:54:50.273 --> 00:55:02.117]  And they're moving globally to shut down all their competition and bring this tyranny in so that you financially are bankrupt so that you can be micromanaged for the government handouts or the job you have.
[00:55:02.897 --> 00:55:04.257]  That's the social control.
[00:55:04.297 --> 00:55:13.800]  The last thing they want is people with independent towns, independent regions, independent local government, local healthy farms, healthy local markets.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:17.081]  The system does not want that.
[00:55:18.117 --> 00:55:21.399]  They want global standardized planetary government.
[00:55:24.061 --> 00:55:25.742]  This is how we're being conquered.
[00:55:25.802 --> 00:55:29.004]  This is a 21st century system to conquer us.
[00:55:30.625 --> 00:55:35.808]  Also, don't worry, USDA says pesticide-laden food is safe.
[00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:42.152]  China stocks plunge amid regulator crackdown on margins.
[00:55:42.932 --> 00:55:47.075]  PayPal Tech says man betrays God by destroying the environment.
[00:55:48.134 --> 00:55:49.754]  But see, it's never really helped the environment.
[00:55:49.794 --> 00:55:51.175]  It's, oh, go along with global government.
[00:55:51.655 --> 00:55:52.295]  It'll fix it.
[00:55:52.315 --> 00:55:54.036]  Just give your rights up, that'll fix the earth.
[00:55:54.996 --> 00:55:56.636]  Pay carbon taxes, that'll fix it.
[00:56:01.257 --> 00:56:06.479]  We're also going to look at Ukrainian troops retake most of major airport from rebels.
[00:56:08.159 --> 00:56:14.561]  Really good news, Chuck Norris raises red flag over Monsanto in his column in WorldNet Daily.
[00:56:16.772 --> 00:56:19.073]  Rand Paul takes money from Monsanto.
[00:56:19.113 --> 00:56:22.514]  I'm not attacking Rand Paul, but he's kind of going more and more mainstream.
[00:56:22.814 --> 00:56:24.415]  He's a lot better than Nancy Pelosi.
[00:56:24.435 --> 00:56:26.416]  He's a lot better than Nyan Feinstein.
[00:56:26.436 --> 00:56:26.976]  I'm just saying.
[00:56:28.976 --> 00:56:30.517]  Rand Paul takes money from Monsanto.
[00:56:30.537 --> 00:56:31.437]  Chuck Norris fights him.
[00:56:32.098 --> 00:56:33.018]  Chuck Norris is a listener.
[00:56:33.058 --> 00:56:34.558]  He's been on many times over the years.
[00:56:34.578 --> 00:56:35.919]  We need to try to work to get him back on.
[00:56:37.079 --> 00:56:41.401]  And I just really respect Chuck Norris telling the truth because Monsanto will try to go after him.
[00:56:43.683 --> 00:56:50.232]  I mean, look, their BT corn grows its own pesticide at 1,000 times what is naturally in corn.
[00:56:50.913 --> 00:56:58.483]  Yes, corn tends to have a fungus on it that's poisonous to bugs and that makes them not like the taste of it, but they put it in the corn
[00:56:59.332 --> 00:57:04.413]  It grows it now, and then you eat it, and it kills honeybees that eat the pollen.
[00:57:05.034 --> 00:57:07.134]  It kills hogs that have been eating it in studies.
[00:57:07.694 --> 00:57:14.016]  And look, he's just coming out saying, hey, we need to look into this, because he isn't somebody who has bad will towards everyone.
[00:57:15.716 --> 00:57:17.197]  I'm not a big Rod Stewart fan.
[00:57:17.457 --> 00:57:20.698]  I like some of his songs, and I heard one on the radio this morning, Forever Young.
[00:57:20.718 --> 00:57:22.398]  I thought, what a Christian song.
[00:57:24.199 --> 00:57:25.599]  And it really is, and it's really simple.
[00:57:27.332 --> 00:57:32.215]  About wishing people well, having goodwill, liking to see other people be healthy and happy, warning people.
[00:57:32.535 --> 00:57:34.036]  That's a normal activity.
[00:57:35.637 --> 00:57:38.859]  One final thing this hour before we go to break and come back and break all this down.
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:50.287]  We have what I believe from the side-by-side studies that are out there, and we have those side-by-side studies at InfoWarsStore.com, the best gravity-fed stainless steel filter system out there.
[00:57:51.007 --> 00:57:53.449]  It's the best and it's lower than the competitors.
[00:57:54.397 --> 00:57:54.737]  I don't
[00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:15.078]  UPS.
[00:58:15.318 --> 00:58:16.780]  So free shipping.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.182]  You also have the clearly filtered family of filters.
[00:58:19.463 --> 00:58:20.223]  They're excellent as well.
[00:58:20.244 --> 00:58:21.685]  A little bit less expensive.
[00:58:22.026 --> 00:58:24.148]  But they reduce or cut a lot of the garbage out.
[00:58:24.288 --> 00:58:26.330]  Will take some of the garbage out entirely.
[00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:29.154]  But it's the reductions of 99% and stuff that you want.
[00:58:30.161 --> 00:58:33.243]  Any folder that says it cuts it all out, you should look at that with a jaundiced eye.
[00:58:33.723 --> 00:58:34.483]  But it is the best.
[00:58:34.864 --> 00:58:39.426]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:39.866 --> 00:58:43.108]  That's Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:43.148 --> 00:58:44.709]  Get free shipping and support the broadcast.

[00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:13.114]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:59:13.114 --> 00:59:13.814]  We're good to go.
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:32.982]  Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shield, Oxy Powder.
[00:59:33.262 --> 00:59:43.729]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.

[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:13.701]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:15.162]  You want answers?
[01:00:15.942 --> 01:00:16.842]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:17.482 --> 01:00:21.143]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:21.664 --> 01:00:25.725]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.345 --> 01:00:31.926]  Man, there's so much news to get to.
[01:00:31.986 --> 01:00:40.269]  DEA secretly tracked all Americans' phone calls for over a decade, document reveals, then would create fake research out of that.
[01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:45.531]  There's just new articles out on it today, so they could then create a fake court case, just total fraud.
[01:00:45.551 --> 01:00:52.814]  We're going to be breaking down why the middle class is disappearing and who really runs the so-called one-tenth of one percent.
[01:00:54.175 --> 01:00:55.616]  I was just going through this stack of news.
[01:00:56.156 --> 01:00:57.816]  My old buddy, I'm in two of his movies.
[01:00:57.836 --> 01:00:58.857]  He lives right here in Austin.
[01:00:59.497 --> 01:01:00.357]  Rick Linklater.
[01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:03.638]  Bolstered for Oscars at London Critics Awards.
[01:01:05.179 --> 01:01:07.820]  Winning that and set, they think, to probably win Oscars.
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.821]  So he deserves one.
[01:01:09.861 --> 01:01:10.801]  He's really a great guy.
[01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:14.502]  Boyhood is a powerful film, but pretty long.
[01:01:15.643 --> 01:01:18.904]  I don't think it's his best film, but he certainly deserves an Oscar.
[01:01:18.924 --> 01:01:22.325]  It's just a little side issue.
[01:01:25.486 --> 01:01:27.087]  Clint Eastwood, fistful of dollars.
[01:01:27.167 --> 01:01:28.388]  Sniper the first week in.
[01:01:28.408 --> 01:01:31.030]  American Sniper makes $105 million.
[01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:33.291]  And there's now a big controversy.
[01:01:33.911 --> 01:01:35.913]  American Sniper complaints grow in Hollywood.
[01:01:35.933 --> 01:01:37.614]  Should Clint Eastwood be celebrating a killer?
[01:01:39.275 --> 01:01:43.297]  You know, that's not my issue, humanizing a sniper in a war.
[01:01:44.258 --> 01:01:46.199]  And I know people want to believe in Chris Kyle.
[01:01:46.559 --> 01:01:47.680]  I've debated Chris Kyle.
[01:01:48.481 --> 01:01:49.041]  Repeatedly.
[01:01:49.821 --> 01:01:51.402]  Hey, we ought to grab that opening ante.
[01:01:51.442 --> 01:01:52.103]  It was one other show.
[01:01:53.356 --> 01:02:05.925]  I mean, I was nice to him, but I told him, I said, Jesse Ventura is going to sue you, and you've already changed your story.
[01:02:05.945 --> 01:02:07.346]  This is for Jesse Suiting.
[01:02:07.947 --> 01:02:10.288]  I said, you need to back off right now and admit it was a lie.
[01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:13.050]  He said, I'm not going to do that.
[01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:19.015]  In fact, I need to do a special report for the Nightly News tonight.
[01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:23.439]  In fact, do just have it set up at the end of the show.
[01:02:23.459 --> 01:02:24.219]  I'm going to shoot this.
[01:02:24.859 --> 01:02:25.759]  Don't do this properly.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:31.241]  I'm going to tie it into Private Lynch and members of her team getting killed when it went public.
[01:02:31.801 --> 01:02:36.042]  Pat Tillman and the mainstream articles about it being a homicide when the Army coroner broke ranks.
[01:02:38.323 --> 01:02:44.785]  And I want to get some other examples of other military people who were used as PR fronts who didn't play ball so they killed him.
[01:02:46.065 --> 01:02:48.046]  And I believe Chris Kyle was murdered.
[01:02:49.146 --> 01:02:50.787]  I know people that know Chris Kyle.
[01:02:52.756 --> 01:03:05.267]  In fact, I have had some friends, I'll just leave it at that, that I've known a very long time that are friends with Chris Kyle, and one of them is polite but will not associate with me anymore, basically because I sided with Ventura.
[01:03:06.148 --> 01:03:07.529]  So I'm right here in Texas, folks.
[01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:10.212]  I've been involved in this up to my eyeballs.
[01:03:10.772 --> 01:03:12.153]  So this is what I want for the nightly news.
[01:03:12.714 --> 01:03:17.939]  Get the clips off of Opie and Anthony when I was on there talking Chris Kyle.
[01:03:18.139 --> 01:03:18.859]  It's on YouTube.
[01:03:19.804 --> 01:03:23.065]  Alex Jones, you know, talks Chris Kyle, I think's the name of it.
[01:03:23.405 --> 01:03:26.686]  Get a clip of that so viewers know I'm not just saying this.
[01:03:27.886 --> 01:03:32.848]  And then I want to show what looks like Kraft at the Boston bombing.
[01:03:32.868 --> 01:03:40.830]  I'm not saying Kraft was involved, but it's the Kraft uniform, the Kraft Punisher hats, with the blood, and the cops are there taking their direction.
[01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:44.091]  People say, that could be anybody in Punisher outfits, directing the police.
[01:03:46.724 --> 01:03:47.885]  Running around in black backpacks?
[01:03:48.685 --> 01:03:50.386]  It's time I do a report on Chris Kyle.
[01:03:52.266 --> 01:03:53.167]  I mean, who else can?
[01:03:53.287 --> 01:03:56.648]  I've been deeply involved in this from the beginning, and I'm gonna go see it.
[01:03:57.229 --> 01:03:57.989]  It's been sold out.
[01:03:58.029 --> 01:04:01.030]  I was gonna go Saturday night, and no theater in town had it.
[01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:03.852]  So I got tickets for Wednesday night.
[01:04:04.872 --> 01:04:13.736]  So I'll have a review for you, but I've already read the book, so I know what the film is, and I've read the cheat sheet on it, and it is a load of bull.
[01:04:15.919 --> 01:04:20.340]  Kyle even admitted in interviews that a lot of it was basically hype in the book.
[01:04:24.201 --> 01:04:27.902]  There were snipers in Vietnam that killed 300, 400 people.
[01:04:27.942 --> 01:04:29.262]  They just couldn't confirm them all.
[01:04:29.742 --> 01:04:32.723]  There were snipers in Korea that may have killed up to 500 people.
[01:04:37.504 --> 01:04:40.405]  But they can't confirm it because it was human wave attacks.
[01:04:41.738 --> 01:04:43.760]  So he's just not America's most deadly sniper.
[01:04:44.661 --> 01:04:47.103]  And a lot of what's in the book is a fairytale.
[01:04:47.944 --> 01:04:49.226]  Jesse Ventura doesn't drink.
[01:04:49.266 --> 01:04:53.210]  Jesse Ventura doesn't go bad-mouthing Navy SEALs at the events.
[01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:55.151]  And it was all bull.
[01:04:55.212 --> 01:04:56.112]  He lost the court case.
[01:04:56.613 --> 01:04:57.394]  So that's justice.
[01:04:58.815 --> 01:05:00.397]  And it was designed to destroy Jesse Ventura.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:07.341]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:07.481 --> 01:05:11.462]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:11.762 --> 01:05:13.222]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:21.124]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:21.404 --> 01:05:22.244]  But for how long?
[01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:28.805]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:05:29.185 --> 01:05:31.986]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:36.612]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:05:36.912 --> 01:05:44.957]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:05:45.157 --> 01:05:50.181]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:05:50.581 --> 01:05:52.882]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:05:53.102 --> 01:05:54.904]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:06:04.079 --> 01:06:08.040]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super male.
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.020]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.781]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[01:06:13.061 --> 01:06:14.941]  InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:06:45.054 --> 01:06:45.775]  That's true.
[01:06:46.795 --> 01:06:50.518]  Just amazing what it's able to do to actually detox the body.
[01:06:50.658 --> 01:06:51.499]  It's great stuff.

[01:07:03.385 --> 01:07:12.072]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[01:07:12.373 --> 01:07:22.381]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:07:22.922 --> 01:07:28.987]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:07:29.327 --> 01:07:35.491]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:07:35.731 --> 01:07:43.937]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[01:07:44.337 --> 01:07:47.139]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:07:47.419 --> 01:07:48.580]  No needles, no injections.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.241]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:07:50.341 --> 01:07:51.262]  Try it for yourself.
[01:07:51.542 --> 01:07:52.523]  Discover the secret.
[01:07:52.883 --> 01:07:53.203]  Secret 12.

[01:07:59.167 --> 01:08:00.308]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:00.328 --> 01:08:01.609]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:33.966 --> 01:08:40.951]  Argentinian prosecutor who accused the President, Christina Kirchner, of her 1994 bombings has been found dead.
[01:08:40.971 --> 01:08:48.917]  Alberto Nisman, who on Monday was due in Parliament to present his case against the President, found dead.
[01:08:49.437 --> 01:08:52.639]  Days after warning, I could end up dead because of this.
[01:08:53.179 --> 01:08:54.961]  That's the London Telegraph.
[01:08:55.481 --> 01:08:58.303]  We also have it posted to InfoWars.com.
[01:09:00.914 --> 01:09:04.116]  AFP is also carrying the report.
[01:09:06.797 --> 01:09:11.700]  And they're already in that country's newspapers calling it a conspiracy theory.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:18.363]  If you question his death, he's about to present to Parliament bombshell evidence.
[01:09:19.944 --> 01:09:21.165]  He says, I could be found dead.
[01:09:21.185 --> 01:09:22.005]  I'm being threatened.
[01:09:23.646 --> 01:09:24.507]  He's found dead.
[01:09:25.652 --> 01:09:27.473]  And you're not supposed to question that.
[01:09:28.154 --> 01:09:31.336]  See, that's the label conspiracy theorist.
[01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:38.822]  It's just meant to not ask questions and to shut down any serious form of debate.
[01:09:43.922 --> 01:09:49.704]  The prosecutor found dead just hours before giving what was expected to be damning testimony against the president.
[01:09:50.045 --> 01:09:54.346]  Appears to have committed suicide, the nation's top security official said Monday.
[01:09:54.987 --> 01:09:58.528]  Oh, the nation's top... Who do you think carried out the hit?
[01:10:01.929 --> 01:10:03.710]  The people doing the investigation?
[01:10:05.031 --> 01:10:05.471]  Think so?
[01:10:05.491 --> 01:10:08.892]  Who do you think kills people for the president?
[01:10:11.393 --> 01:10:12.074]  I'd give it a 99% chance.
[01:10:15.695 --> 01:10:18.036]  Oh, I bet there's going to be a handwritten note there.
[01:10:18.476 --> 01:10:19.556]  Let me tell you how that works.
[01:10:19.916 --> 01:10:24.957]  Fill this out, and we're going to blow your kid's head off when they get out of school today.
[01:10:28.318 --> 01:10:28.918]  That's how they do it.
[01:10:29.619 --> 01:10:32.219]  Then you fill out your suicide note, and they go, okay, you made the right decision.
[01:10:32.659 --> 01:10:33.199]  Boom!
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:38.381]  Maybe you flinch when they pull the trigger, so they shoot you a couple more times.
[01:10:38.841 --> 01:10:39.761]  Maybe you fight them.
[01:10:39.781 --> 01:10:43.202]  There's been cases of that, and they shoot you as you run down the street.
[01:10:45.902 --> 01:10:50.363]  And of course, there was gun control restrictions there, so even as a prosecutor, he had trouble having a gun.
[01:10:52.023 --> 01:10:54.444]  But of course, the security services, they always have a gun.
[01:10:54.684 --> 01:11:02.166]  Whether it's Nazi Germany, or Soviet Russia, or Mao's China, because they know that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.
[01:11:06.167 --> 01:11:11.048]  On the nightly news tonight, I will give you my breakdown of the American sniper film.
[01:11:14.161 --> 01:11:15.302]  I've read the cheat sheet of it.
[01:11:15.322 --> 01:11:20.284]  I'm seeing it Wednesday, but I've already read online the complete basically transcript of the film.
[01:11:20.564 --> 01:11:23.806]  It's the book that Ventura sued over and won in court.
[01:11:24.366 --> 01:11:25.447]  It is a fiction.
[01:11:26.187 --> 01:11:28.429]  I know it feels good to go watch a great Clint Eastwood movie.
[01:11:28.469 --> 01:11:29.289]  I love Clint Eastwood.
[01:11:29.529 --> 01:11:30.249]  He's a great director.
[01:11:30.690 --> 01:11:32.891]  It is a load of baloney.
[01:11:34.755 --> 01:11:36.536]  He was not crying about shooting people.
[01:11:36.776 --> 01:11:38.016]  He was not torn up about it.
[01:11:38.396 --> 01:11:42.037]  My problem with Clint Eastwood's film is that it's just not Chris Kyle.
[01:11:42.397 --> 01:11:43.058]  Make a movie!
[01:11:43.618 --> 01:11:46.098]  That sounds avant-garde where he goes, they're all dirty savages.
[01:11:46.319 --> 01:11:47.759]  I want to kill more of these animals.
[01:11:47.779 --> 01:11:48.799]  I mean, those are quotes.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.240]  Two newspapers.
[01:11:55.901 --> 01:11:57.302]  He became a security risk.
[01:11:58.570 --> 01:12:00.191]  Because the story was unraveling.
[01:12:00.231 --> 01:12:02.152]  So how do you prop a story up that's unraveling?
[01:12:02.572 --> 01:12:07.434]  You kill the living hero to make him more sanctified as a martyr.
[01:12:09.055 --> 01:12:10.055]  Just like Pat Tillman.
[01:12:12.176 --> 01:12:15.317]  The great NFL star killed battling Al Qaeda on a hill.
[01:12:15.637 --> 01:12:17.778]  Turned out he was murdered in cold blood begging for his life.
[01:12:18.919 --> 01:12:19.659]  Army's own report.
[01:12:20.519 --> 01:12:21.140]  Same story.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.221]  Different man.
[01:12:24.641 --> 01:12:26.182]  And Pat Tillman was a hero.
[01:12:27.182 --> 01:12:38.549]  He gave up multi-million dollar a year contract, went over there to fight with his brother, found out it was all bull, we were growing the drugs, running all sorts of stuff, working with Al-Qaeda, trying to write letters home to his family.
[01:12:38.829 --> 01:12:40.470]  I've talked to his brother and it's come out in the news.
[01:12:41.411 --> 01:12:43.712]  And they murdered him, murdered him good.
[01:12:43.732 --> 01:12:49.015]  They ought to make a movie about Pat Tillman, and about how they murdered him.
[01:12:49.215 --> 01:12:56.260]  That's a movie that deserves a Pulitzer Prize for the article written on it, and then
[01:12:57.711 --> 01:12:59.092]  A major Oscar.
[01:13:00.874 --> 01:13:02.395]  That's what Clint Eastwood should be making.
[01:13:03.256 --> 01:13:06.418]  Oh, but Clint Eastwood's been doing government propaganda since the 40s.
[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:08.881]  Clint Eastwood.
[01:13:08.901 --> 01:13:11.162]  He asses up his own car.
[01:13:12.103 --> 01:13:13.464]  Super hardcore conservative.
[01:13:13.504 --> 01:13:14.505]  Loves Ronald Reagan.
[01:13:15.366 --> 01:13:24.073]  Listens to KSCO that we're on in the area there in California.
[01:13:25.354 --> 01:13:25.895]  Santa Cruz.
[01:13:31.378 --> 01:13:36.122]  Old Clint Eastwood, who calls in on Michael Savage's show, there in San Francisco.
[01:13:37.784 --> 01:13:39.925]  Though for a fact, tunes into this show.
[01:13:42.287 --> 01:13:43.528]  I don't even know what to say about that.
[01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:52.516]  I guess she just believes America is just so good and so wonderful that even if it isn't true about Chris Kyle, give her this great image.
[01:13:53.637 --> 01:13:55.258]  I don't know, why didn't you just make a fiction film then?
[01:13:59.778 --> 01:14:09.464]  See, I said I would do this tonight because I want to go over all the evidence of them killing Jessica Lynch's team members because she hid in fear, didn't shoot the Iraqis and all that.
[01:14:09.484 --> 01:14:11.145]  Remember Private Lynch, all that bull?
[01:14:12.246 --> 01:14:13.467]  And Pat Tillman, all that bull?
[01:14:14.267 --> 01:14:16.569]  They kill people to keep these stories going.
[01:14:16.949 --> 01:14:21.892]  And they no doubt killed Chris Kyle in that made-up PTSD story.
[01:14:24.774 --> 01:14:26.495]  Now that said, let me get into this report.
[01:14:29.386 --> 01:14:33.848]  Middle class decline looms over final years of Obama presidency.
[01:14:35.549 --> 01:14:42.812]  Reuters, Barack Obama enters his final two years of the presidency with a blemish on the legacy that looks impossible to erase.
[01:14:43.353 --> 01:14:46.394]  The decline of the middle class he has promised to rescue.
[01:14:47.535 --> 01:14:50.696]  If he promises something, you know it's the opposite.
[01:14:51.236 --> 01:14:52.257]  He zigs, you zag.
[01:14:54.244 --> 01:15:02.030]  The revival of middle-class jobs has been one of Obama's mantras since he took office in 2009, fighting the worst economic crisis in generations.
[01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:09.275]  It was a major theme of the last State of the Union address and is expected to feature in one of his scheduled for tomorrow.
[01:15:10.536 --> 01:15:22.806]  Administration officials said on Saturday the president would propose higher capital gains taxes, new fees on large financial firms, and other measures to raise $320 billion for programs and tax breaks aimed at the middle class.
[01:15:24.147 --> 01:15:29.611]  Yeah, tax break, raising taxes on somebody making $125,000 a year.
[01:15:30.932 --> 01:15:38.076]  Folks making $125,000 a year are the ones that buy cars, go to the spa, go on vacations, give money to the PTA.
[01:15:38.096 --> 01:15:44.681]  I mean, that is exactly what you want, is a nation of people making that money, who then get services.
[01:15:46.882 --> 01:15:50.585]  But you raise taxes on them, and you create an economy where they couldn't make money.
[01:15:51.783 --> 01:15:56.406]  And then it just goes on to say, but for the middle class, the scars of the recession still run deep.
[01:15:56.726 --> 01:16:02.090]  See, Reuters is acting like, oh, Obama tried to fix it, but he couldn't, but he's going to promise you one more time.
[01:16:07.974 --> 01:16:16.600]  The number one enemy of the top 10% of the 1%, the crony capitalists, the insiders, the Goldman Sachs and JP Morgans,
[01:16:18.109 --> 01:16:22.130]  They lobby to raise taxes on the middle class because they end up getting that in banker bailout money.
[01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:24.191]  They want to shut down their competition.
[01:16:25.892 --> 01:16:30.013]  They want a consolidated, controlled, command-and-control economy.
[01:16:30.653 --> 01:16:32.714]  And the Japan Times has a report on this today.
[01:16:33.134 --> 01:16:37.155]  Richest 1% will hold half of global wealth in 2016.
[01:16:37.295 --> 01:16:38.676]  It's much worse than that.
[01:16:39.496 --> 01:16:42.857]  And again, it's not bad that they have wealth.
[01:16:42.917 --> 01:16:47.539]  It's that they got it by controlled markets, by rigging things, by getting government bailouts.
[01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:51.191]  By bid rigging.
[01:16:51.872 --> 01:16:53.033]  By no-bid contracts.
[01:16:53.974 --> 01:17:01.183]  And when you look at who Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway and all these groups, who they donate to, it's across the board.
[01:17:01.263 --> 01:17:02.064]  Take your guns.
[01:17:02.444 --> 01:17:03.465]  Pass Obamacare.
[01:17:04.466 --> 01:17:05.167]  To rip you off.
[01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:05.968]  And that's in this report.
[01:17:06.168 --> 01:17:09.092]  That it's the insurance companies that grew the biggest for the billionaires.
[01:17:11.798 --> 01:17:12.459]  Off of U.S.
[01:17:12.479 --> 01:17:13.019]  taxpayers.
[01:17:13.079 --> 01:17:16.261]  I mean, you understand, it's basically doubling and tripling health care.
[01:17:16.541 --> 01:17:17.822]  Already one-seventh the economy.
[01:17:18.122 --> 01:17:21.364]  When they're done, it's going to be like one-fourth.
[01:17:21.625 --> 01:17:23.366]  They're just taking everything over.
[01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:31.851]  And then you're going to get worse health care, but the average liberal thinks Martin Luther King was the first man to walk on the moon.
[01:17:34.253 --> 01:17:35.994]  They don't know what planet they're on.
[01:17:36.675 --> 01:17:40.117]  You just say, do this or you're racist, and they say, okay, I'll do what you say.
[01:17:40.317 --> 01:17:41.238]  That's all they know.
[01:17:43.351 --> 01:17:44.813]  That's all they can do.
[01:17:44.933 --> 01:17:46.055]  They're helpless.
[01:17:46.335 --> 01:17:48.138]  They'll vote however they're told.
[01:17:48.178 --> 01:17:50.821]  They'll vote to slit their own throats if they're told it's trendy.
[01:17:53.585 --> 01:17:57.150]  And so the elite are getting rid of any competition right now.
[01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:58.411]  They're sewing it up.
[01:17:59.473 --> 01:18:00.775]  We're gonna be third world all the way.
[01:18:02.190 --> 01:18:12.998]  And the third world population, black, white, hispanic, I don't care what color they are, they've all got that dumbered in a box of rocks look in their eyes, that stupid smile, that self-satisfiedness that fools always have.
[01:18:13.018 --> 01:18:17.701]  And their ignorance, they believe, is the ultimate ace in the hole that trumps everything on earth.
[01:18:18.622 --> 01:18:19.943]  Ignorance is bliss, they say.
[01:18:20.343 --> 01:18:21.884]  Yeah, until you run into a ditch.
[01:18:23.946 --> 01:18:26.628]  I'm gonna skip this network break because I gotta get this special report as well.
[01:18:28.939 --> 01:18:31.800]  Richest 1% will hold half of global wealth in the next year.
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:35.621]  Wealth accumulated by the richest 1% will exceed that of the other 99%.
[01:18:36.481 --> 01:18:41.482]  The Oxfam charity said on Monday, ahead of an annual meeting of the world's most powerful in Davos, Switzerland.
[01:18:42.522 --> 01:18:49.724]  And the very rich, Warren Buffet, Ted Turner, George Soros, they're the ones calling for, quote, higher taxes on the rich.
[01:18:50.084 --> 01:18:57.746]  But every time the real proposal gets there, it's not tax any of their groups offshore that pay zero, basically.
[01:19:00.191 --> 01:19:02.913]  It's tax people making $100,000 a year.
[01:19:04.153 --> 01:19:07.115]  It's raised payroll taxes on people making $20,000 a year.
[01:19:07.155 --> 01:19:08.015]  That was on Obamacare.
[01:19:10.417 --> 01:19:15.419]  But the poor have a lottery mentality on average, where they're always looking to get rich.
[01:19:15.479 --> 01:19:18.421]  Somebody ran into me, I'm going to get a settlement, even though you're not really hurt.
[01:19:21.095 --> 01:19:26.436]  I'm gonna win a lottery ticket, and I just love hearing a president, I'm gonna give you a free house, a free car, and free health care.
[01:19:27.156 --> 01:19:30.537]  And when you don't get it, you're like, well, just give me another socialist, they'll promise me.
[01:19:33.258 --> 01:19:34.218]  Wealth accumulated.
[01:19:34.678 --> 01:19:41.140]  The scale of global inequity is quite simply staggering, and they'll use that to bring in even more socialism, see, which they're exempt from.
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:47.981]  And despite the issue shooting up the global agenda, the gap between the richest and the rest is widening fast.
[01:19:48.361 --> 01:19:50.342]  Oxfam Executive Director Winnie
[01:19:52.199 --> 01:19:53.180]  Benyamin said.
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.701]  If I'm butchering that correctly.
[01:19:57.762 --> 01:19:59.623]  And then you continue here.
[01:20:00.524 --> 01:20:03.446]  The richest 1% share of global wealth increased from 44% in 2009 to 48% in 2014.
[01:20:03.486 --> 01:20:06.007]  The British charity said in a report adding that it will be more than 50% by 2016.
[01:20:06.327 --> 01:20:06.688]  And then so on.
[01:20:17.503 --> 01:20:21.506]  They use Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report and the Forbes Billionaires List.
[01:20:22.187 --> 01:20:29.812]  One-fifth of global billionaires have interest in the financial and insurance sectors, and saw their cash climb 11% in one year.
[01:20:30.113 --> 01:20:32.314]  Yeah, just off the Obamacare screwjob.
[01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:41.962]  The Oxfam Brief says, pharmaceutical and healthcare billionaires saw a 47% bump in collective worth in one year.
[01:20:43.692 --> 01:20:46.113]  Again, worldwide Obamacare-type strategies.
[01:20:46.493 --> 01:20:47.434]  It wasn't just done here.
[01:20:48.334 --> 01:20:54.957]  They get to double, triple prices, tell you it's cheaper, and the average person believes it because they're dumb!
[01:20:54.977 --> 01:20:55.858]  I mean, you know.
[01:20:57.118 --> 01:21:02.641]  They know who all the football players are and how to stick their chest out walking around a grocery store and grunt at other men.
[01:21:03.641 --> 01:21:07.603]  They probably wouldn't know what to do if somebody jumped on top of them and started slamming their head in the ground, though.
[01:21:08.524 --> 01:21:08.724]  See?
[01:21:08.984 --> 01:21:09.844]  It's all fake.
[01:21:09.884 --> 01:21:11.145]  It's all hat, no kettle.
[01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:14.171]  It's all empty.
[01:21:15.092 --> 01:21:16.213]  There's no bona fides.
[01:21:19.976 --> 01:21:21.997]  They don't want to hear about how they got screwed over.
[01:21:22.478 --> 01:21:26.201]  And neither does the middle class or the average doctor or lawyer.
[01:21:26.221 --> 01:21:27.622]  Because you know what?
[01:21:27.722 --> 01:21:30.424]  They don't want to hear it because it makes them feel like they're not number one.
[01:21:30.725 --> 01:21:35.969]  They like to go pay a thousand dollars and be at a congressman's dinner and feel like they're part of the elite and shakes the governor's hand.
[01:21:37.435 --> 01:21:47.098]  See, the middle class doesn't want to really be a middle class and doesn't want their kids to be at the top of the class because they just want to be in fantasy land and believe they're in control.
[01:21:48.059 --> 01:21:50.740]  Bless your soul, you think you're in control.
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:52.540]  To quote Narls Barkley.
[01:21:56.562 --> 01:22:04.905]  I mean, why do you think the insurance company spent over two billion dollars on record that we know of passing Obamacare?
[01:22:06.513 --> 01:22:09.196]  Why don't you think the Republicans will repeal it?
[01:22:09.836 --> 01:22:18.725]  John Boehner alone is set to make more than $5 million in just the next few years on his Obamacare investments in insurance companies.
[01:22:21.528 --> 01:22:22.368]  Pretty cheap, huh?
[01:22:23.109 --> 01:22:24.450]  They're making hundreds of billions.
[01:22:25.031 --> 01:22:26.973]  Old Boehner makes a couple million extra.
[01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:35.916]  And remember when Congress got caught six, seven years ago insider trading, CBS News headline, Congress legalizes insider trading.
[01:22:36.476 --> 01:22:38.018]  How about child molestation?
[01:22:38.978 --> 01:22:42.761]  See, this thing's all hidden in plain view, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:44.843 --> 01:22:49.607]  By the way, the article's very informative, because it's stuff we already told you, but here it is in the Japan Times.
[01:22:52.731 --> 01:22:57.414]  And they got it off of screwing you over with your healthcare that was already screwed up because they've been looting it for 30 years.
[01:22:57.934 --> 01:23:01.397]  We had the best, cheapest healthcare in the world by every metric 50-something years ago.
[01:23:01.497 --> 01:23:02.477]  Now we have some of the worst.
[01:23:03.158 --> 01:23:17.587]  And don't worry, it's going to get worse and their new solutions will be even bigger screw jobs and the lottery ticket mentality of wanting to believe the rhetoric one more time and feel good and pick a candidate from the establishment and feel like you're winning.
[01:23:17.927 --> 01:23:20.249]  You're going to go buy that stupid ticket and you're going to do it over and over again.
[01:23:21.852 --> 01:23:27.918]  Oxfam is concerned that lobbying power of these sectors is a major barrier in way of reforming the global tax system.
[01:23:28.358 --> 01:23:32.242]  The release says the group proposes a crackdown on corporate individual tax dodging.
[01:23:32.582 --> 01:23:38.608]  Is that why all over Europe and the US and Australia they've gotten rid of all the major billionaire white-collar fraud investigators?
[01:23:38.628 --> 01:23:41.891]  I mean they've got rid of all of them and only go after now blue-collar?
[01:23:43.223 --> 01:23:47.787]  You can search the headline, IRS changes focus to blue collar workers.
[01:23:48.168 --> 01:23:57.056]  The IRS will spend $50,000 or more trying to get $1,000 out of some shoe repair shop in one article I saw out of Illinois.
[01:23:58.938 --> 01:23:59.799]  We think you didn't pay $1,000.
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:01.921]  We think you kept cash.
[01:24:02.241 --> 01:24:06.846]  We're going to have a huge trial and investigation to throw you in jail and take your shoe store.
[01:24:10.851 --> 01:24:13.754]  You're not going to have lemonade stands or coffee stands.
[01:24:13.774 --> 01:24:17.197]  You're not going to have unlicensed food trucks.
[01:24:17.457 --> 01:24:21.380]  You're not going to have events where you can sell pumpkins on the side of the road or firewood.
[01:24:21.721 --> 01:24:25.344]  No, you don't do anything in the Supermax prison.
[01:24:27.346 --> 01:24:31.990]  We're going to take your bank accounts with no judge, no jury, no trial because you made small deposits.
[01:24:35.129 --> 01:24:37.511]  If you're a radio listener, I just put the New York Times on screen saying that.
[01:24:38.111 --> 01:24:39.152]  I'm not making this up.
[01:24:39.332 --> 01:24:41.234]  Oh, and you think it's going to get worse.
[01:24:41.254 --> 01:24:41.934]  You understand that?
[01:24:45.137 --> 01:24:50.921]  Oxfam is concerned that the lobbying power of these sectors is a major barrier in the way of reforming the global tax system.
[01:24:50.941 --> 01:25:03.491]  The release says, the group proposes a crackdown on the corporate individual tax dodging, more investment in free public services, oh, more free, and a shift in taxes towards capital and wealth to help fix the problem.
[01:25:05.165 --> 01:25:10.488]  They mean individual capital, not part of the globalist organizations that have already been given diplomatic immunity by the UN.
[01:25:10.908 --> 01:25:17.911]  Oxfam called on states to tackle tax evasion, just like the French have done, up to 100 percent, then the socialists are exempt.
[01:25:18.532 --> 01:25:21.773]  Improve public services, tax capital, rather than labor.
[01:25:23.074 --> 01:25:25.095]  Well, that's the Communist Manifesto says tax.
[01:25:26.334 --> 01:25:26.654]  Labor.
[01:25:26.795 --> 01:25:27.936]  But see, you're not supposed to do that.
[01:25:28.577 --> 01:25:30.920]  Introduce living minimum wages.
[01:25:31.701 --> 01:25:33.343]  That'll just cut people out of the workforce.
[01:25:33.963 --> 01:25:38.248]  Among these other measures is a bid to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth.
[01:25:38.609 --> 01:25:40.711]  Oh, and the elites are all calling for that.
[01:25:40.751 --> 01:25:41.192]  Don't worry.
[01:25:41.452 --> 01:25:43.455]  They're going to fix the problem they've engineered.
[01:25:45.083 --> 01:25:56.626]  And the 45th World Economic Forum is coming up, and they want carbon taxes to help the poor as well, even though when you read the past proposals, it's carbon taxes on the poorest who shut you down!
[01:25:56.966 --> 01:25:59.287]  Just like Obamacare increased your prices!
[01:26:01.327 --> 01:26:03.648]  And now all Obamacare has done is poor people...
[01:26:06.152 --> 01:26:25.800]  Think that they can now get free health care when they could always get charity care and they could always get in there and get it, but now it's going to federal care through the insurance companies and the prices are just higher and so the hospitals are either making record profits if they're insiders or they're going bankrupt, which is another consolidation.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:31.102]  And when they're done, you'll pay five times what you did and then they're going to go right to eugenics care.
[01:26:32.639 --> 01:26:43.389]  So that's how the insider scam works and the profits for the insurance companies and banks are up 40 plus percent just since Obamacare went in a year ago.
[01:26:43.950 --> 01:26:49.255]  Japan Times, from the Davos Group, from the major reports.
[01:26:49.896 --> 01:26:50.576]  There you go.
[01:26:50.596 --> 01:26:51.577]  That's how it works.
[01:26:53.339 --> 01:26:55.201]  And the middle class is all but disappearing.
[01:27:00.034 --> 01:27:11.501]  Let's now go to a report from this weekend up in Dallas, DFW area, where Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson went out to the Respect Prophet Muhammad event to cover exactly what happened.
[01:27:12.001 --> 01:27:13.062]  Here is that report.
[01:27:21.081 --> 01:27:23.062]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:27:23.302 --> 01:27:29.625]  Now we are standing outside of the Curtis Colwell Convention Center in Garland, Texas, just above Dallas, Texas.
[01:27:29.865 --> 01:27:34.347]  Now today there's going to be a rally at 5 p.m., the Stand with the Prophet rally.
[01:27:34.507 --> 01:27:40.049]  There's going to be a lot of controversial Islamic speakers and Imams from New York City that is coming here.
[01:27:40.329 --> 01:27:45.792]  We first read in the Washington Free Beacon article a few days ago that this was going to happen.
[01:27:46.172 --> 01:27:53.536]  And I kind of had an idea that there would probably be some people in a small town like this in Texas that are going to show up and protest this.
[01:27:53.576 --> 01:28:00.500]  And as you can see back here, there are hundreds of people lined up and down the road waving their American flags, Jewish flags.
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:08.085]  A lot of people have the Jesus Charlie signs up from the attacks that happened in France at Charlie Hebdo.
[01:28:08.405 --> 01:28:08.805]  What's your name?
[01:28:09.065 --> 01:28:10.046]  I'm just a boy in Ronco.
[01:28:10.746 --> 01:28:11.247]  Nice to meet you.
[01:28:11.267 --> 01:28:12.388]  So why are you out here today, sir?
[01:28:12.848 --> 01:28:14.229]  Well, it's a nice day, number one.
[01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:32.284]  And number two, you know, it's everybody's right to practice their religion and live their lives and kind of get along, and so... Well, so I heard that one of the main reasons of the rally was to kind of squash a lot of the Islamophobia that they say is created by the mainstream media.
[01:28:32.524 --> 01:28:35.267]  Do you believe the mainstream media hypes up this Islamophobia?
[01:28:36.508 --> 01:28:38.650]  I feel they're benefiting from that industry, yeah.
[01:28:39.625 --> 01:28:40.105]  And how so?
[01:28:40.885 --> 01:28:43.086]  Well, it keeps people making money.
[01:28:44.106 --> 01:28:46.307]  What do you think about the Charlie Hebdo attacks?
[01:28:47.067 --> 01:28:48.207]  I think it was a tragedy.
[01:28:49.728 --> 01:28:52.689]  So, in any kind of way, do you condone anything like that whatsoever?
[01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:54.189]  Because a lot of people think... No.
[01:28:55.069 --> 01:28:57.750]  I don't condone any killing of anybody.
[01:28:58.030 --> 01:28:59.951]  And you support freedom of speech, right?
[01:29:00.111 --> 01:29:00.271]  Yes.
[01:29:01.696 --> 01:29:05.602]  And so you have no problem with the other side as well coming out here to speak their minds and all that?
[01:29:05.902 --> 01:29:10.849]  As long as no one forces their religion on you and you don't do it to them, everyone's fine and dandy, right?
[01:29:10.869 --> 01:29:11.209]  Exactly.
[01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:13.633]  I like the idea of the bikers going around, you know,
[01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:16.164]  Folks, we're gonna come back!
[01:29:43.484 --> 01:29:46.307]  With the conclusion of Joe Biggs' report, we're going to talk to Mark Deiss.
[01:29:46.707 --> 01:29:51.552]  We got Joe Biggs in studio to give us a breakdown of what he saw up in Dallas at the Muhammad Rally.
[01:29:51.572 --> 01:29:52.013]  Stay with us.
[01:29:52.854 --> 01:29:53.755]  We're on the march.
[01:29:54.255 --> 01:29:55.857]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.798 --> 01:29:59.461]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.362 --> 01:30:10.424]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:30:10.524 --> 01:30:12.685]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:30:12.865 --> 01:30:17.966]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:30:18.146 --> 01:30:23.088]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:30:23.328 --> 01:30:26.391]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:30:26.651 --> 01:30:30.495]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:30:30.715 --> 01:30:34.958]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:30:35.039 --> 01:30:45.087]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:30:45.288 --> 01:30:47.790]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,

[01:31:33.479 --> 01:31:36.980]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:41.101]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:31:41.422 --> 01:31:42.862]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:31:43.202 --> 01:31:50.784]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:31:51.045 --> 01:31:51.905]  But for how long?

[01:32:57.982 --> 01:32:58.323]  Silver Bullet.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:24.843]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:25.424 --> 01:33:27.286]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.327 --> 01:33:43.821]  Alright, I saw a lot of mainline conservative news websites last week claiming that there was going to be a terrorist rally in Garland, a suburb of Dallas, Texas, in Northeast Texas, where I grew up, basically.
[01:33:44.541 --> 01:33:46.063]  Garland's one of my old stomping grounds.
[01:33:47.352 --> 01:33:50.013]  And so we sent Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson up there.
[01:33:50.053 --> 01:33:50.834]  They did a great job.
[01:33:51.674 --> 01:33:58.678]  And to show how balkanized things are, we got called Islamophobes for sending people up there to cover it.
[01:33:59.879 --> 01:34:02.300]  And then once they got there, I've debriefed Joe.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:03.500]  He's about to talk about it live on air.
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:08.003]  Then we're going to go to Mark Dice in a moment to cover some other ignorance.
[01:34:09.183 --> 01:34:13.786]  As soon as they left the rally against, I guess, Mohammed, you could call it,
[01:34:14.744 --> 01:34:23.571]  And to go over to cover the other side, people booed them and yelled and called them, you know, fags and stuff like that, basic pejoratives.
[01:34:24.071 --> 01:34:24.791]  That's what went on.
[01:34:26.012 --> 01:34:30.696]  It was very infantile from the video I've seen, basically white trash on parade.
[01:34:34.045 --> 01:34:38.828]  That said, there is radical Islam that's being politically protected and allowed to operate.
[01:34:39.408 --> 01:34:44.852]  But they started the conference off, and Joe's going to break this down, condemning everything that happened with the Charlie Hebdo event.
[01:34:46.413 --> 01:34:49.815]  Basically, what we've been told and what we heard was not true about the rally.
[01:34:50.075 --> 01:34:51.616]  And we just went to find out what was happening.
[01:34:53.137 --> 01:34:55.579]  We just try to cover the truth of what's unfolding.
[01:34:57.455 --> 01:35:04.000]  And this is the clash of civilizations that the social engineers want and that they're manipulating to play us off against each other.
[01:35:04.861 --> 01:35:13.168]  On the other hand, they've banned free speech in Germany and criticizing Islam, and the German police have banned anti-Islamic rally citing terror threat.
[01:35:13.488 --> 01:35:15.890]  So see, oh, there's a terror threat, you can't assemble.
[01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:18.772]  Oh, there's a terror threat, you can't have a concert.
[01:35:19.052 --> 01:35:21.675]  There's a terror threat, you can't fly, or we've got a naked body scan you.
[01:35:22.055 --> 01:35:22.335]  No!
[01:35:22.695 --> 01:35:23.896]  We don't give in to the threat!
[01:35:24.337 --> 01:35:25.658]  We're a free, open society!
[01:35:27.205 --> 01:35:30.887]  Imagine if there were real terror attacks in this country, how many rights they'd take.
[01:35:31.948 --> 01:35:39.572]  You get 20 dead at the Ebdo attack, we're talking about getting rid of free speech period and internet censorship, and they've introduced SOPA and CISPA again.
[01:35:40.573 --> 01:35:43.594]  SOPA at the federal level, CISPA internationally.
[01:35:44.235 --> 01:35:45.376]  We told you that was coming!
[01:35:46.556 --> 01:35:49.478]  Merkel's out there marching for free speech while she's banning it in Germany.
[01:35:51.468 --> 01:35:52.389]  So it's outrageous.
[01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:56.434]  Joe Biggs joins us on Martin Luther King Day to talk about free speech, I guess.
[01:35:56.734 --> 01:35:57.675]  I'll just spend a few minutes.
[01:35:57.835 --> 01:36:03.462]  I also noticed they had the Sheriff's Department in their camo there and more inside the building.
[01:36:04.122 --> 01:36:09.709]  We've got more reports coming out tonight of what you actually shot inside, but Joe, give people your breakdown of what happened.
[01:36:10.677 --> 01:36:13.219]  Yeah, when I got there, I didn't know what to expect on the drive up there.
[01:36:13.239 --> 01:36:19.123]  Jakari and I were kind of like at a loss for what we, you know, what we were going to expect when we got there.
[01:36:19.683 --> 01:36:23.866]  I was reading some of the Twitter feeds and they said at this point in time, we're about 30 minutes out.
[01:36:24.146 --> 01:36:28.369]  They said there were hundreds of people already out there protesting at this point in time.
[01:36:28.949 --> 01:36:30.890]  So we're like, all right, this could be interesting.
[01:36:31.171 --> 01:36:40.317]  And as we pulled up to the convention center, hundreds of people lined both sides of the road, tons of motorcycles driving up and down the road, people waving American flags, Jewish flags.
[01:36:40.877 --> 01:36:49.003]  You know, screaming, God bless America, Sharia law doesn't belong here, Mohammed was a homosexual and a pedophile, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:36:49.023 --> 01:36:52.346]  So we park behind the protesters and we go around and start talking to some people.
[01:36:53.286 --> 01:36:56.409]  And one guy goes, oh yeah, InfoWars, glad you guys came out here.
[01:36:56.949 --> 01:36:58.330]  And I was like, well, do you mind if I talk to you, sir?
[01:36:58.370 --> 01:37:00.091]  And he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[01:37:00.111 --> 01:37:01.332]  I was like, so why are you out here, sir?
[01:37:01.352 --> 01:37:04.233]  And he goes, well, I'm out here for freedom of speech.
[01:37:04.894 --> 01:37:11.197]  And I said, well, okay, so do you have a problem with the stand for the profit rally that's happening next door across the street?
[01:37:11.238 --> 01:37:13.799]  I should say, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't think they should be over there.
[01:37:13.819 --> 01:37:17.261]  I don't think they should be allowed to talk to anything like that whatsoever.
[01:37:18.022 --> 01:37:23.485]  So that was just the aspect of people the entire time that they were
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.483]  Just ignorant about everything.
[01:37:28.324 --> 01:37:29.806]  They were just out of their mind.
[01:37:30.487 --> 01:37:33.091]  We were saying they're behind the protesters.
[01:37:34.645 --> 01:37:44.848]  And by the time we went over to where the actual event was, people started booing us, people started calling us names, people started saying, you guys should go to Iraq and see what it's like.
[01:37:45.249 --> 01:37:53.451]  And so we finally get over to the other side, we get out of the vehicle, and I'm watching some of these protesters that are at the entrance of the drive to come into the convention center.
[01:37:54.052 --> 01:37:58.993]  And there's a Muslim guy walks by, and this guy screams out, look, he's got a beard, there's probably a bomb in that beard.
[01:37:59.313 --> 01:38:00.774]  They hide them everywhere, they're shifty.
[01:38:01.554 --> 01:38:03.819]  You know, and it was just, like, out of this world.
[01:38:03.979 --> 01:38:06.784]  So it was like they were trying to get cash for deliverance.
[01:38:07.225 --> 01:38:07.465]  Yeah.
[01:38:07.986 --> 01:38:09.048]  I mean, that's what was there.
[01:38:09.289 --> 01:38:11.353]  And I don't want to knock our listener that was out there.
[01:38:11.493 --> 01:38:12.214]  People get angry.
[01:38:12.254 --> 01:38:13.617]  I've been mean at protests as well.
[01:38:13.657 --> 01:38:13.957]  You get...
[01:38:15.348 --> 01:38:16.109]  In an angry mode.
[01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:21.936]  They had probably read the news articles claiming that this event, because I remember reading these going, is this accurate?
[01:38:21.956 --> 01:38:25.801]  Some of these are pretty big news outlets that are claiming that terrorists were there.
[01:38:26.081 --> 01:38:26.262]  Yeah.
[01:38:26.402 --> 01:38:28.685]  And then as you said, you went and investigated that wasn't the case.
[01:38:29.265 --> 01:38:31.568]  So I think it was the disinformation that hyped them.
[01:38:32.469 --> 01:38:32.829]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:32.989 --> 01:38:37.690]  And you know, when we got into the rally, they started the rally off inside, they had a prayer, and then they opened up, they said, we do not
[01:38:55.354 --> 01:38:57.015]  Uh, condone any acts of violence.
[01:38:57.035 --> 01:38:59.117]  We condemn the attacks of Charlie Hebdo.
[01:38:59.417 --> 01:39:01.099]  We condemn Boko Haram.
[01:39:01.299 --> 01:39:02.240]  We condemn ISIS.
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:03.941]  These are not people of Islam.
[01:39:03.961 --> 01:39:05.702]  They do not follow the Prophet Muhammad.
[01:39:06.082 --> 01:39:18.172]  They, these are people who take, you know, 18, 20-year-old young men who are angry and, you know, piss off at the world and use them and mold their minds into this radical... Did they let you film that?
[01:39:18.892 --> 01:39:19.193]  Uh, no.
[01:39:19.453 --> 01:39:20.534]  We had to sign a consent form.
[01:39:20.554 --> 01:39:21.194]  We couldn't film it.
[01:39:21.214 --> 01:39:23.536]  I know you could film some of it, but not in that one area.
[01:39:23.756 --> 01:39:24.557]  That's so stupid!
[01:39:25.441 --> 01:39:30.701]  Because you'd think they'd need to get that out there because a lot of Muslim groups will not condemn it.
[01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:33.746]  They need to, they should have condemned it publicly.
[01:39:33.766 --> 01:39:35.947]  Well there was an American flag and a Texas flag.
[01:39:35.967 --> 01:39:38.128]  Everyone had a little American flag and a Texas flag.
[01:39:38.288 --> 01:39:39.228]  Each person had one.
[01:39:39.828 --> 01:39:46.351]  It was all, there was hundreds of Muslims in there, and they all were waving them up in the air, you know, and they kept calling themselves Muslim Americans.
[01:39:46.411 --> 01:39:48.091]  So I noticed a drone was out there too.
[01:39:48.211 --> 01:39:55.494]  Yeah, there was a drone out there flying around, but I mean nowadays, I mean everyone can go buy one at a hobby store, so I mean, it didn't have any identifiable marks.
[01:39:55.514 --> 01:39:56.915]  Yeah, a police one will have lights on it.
[01:39:57.075 --> 01:39:57.295]  Yeah.
[01:39:58.288 --> 01:39:59.069]  But there was tons.
[01:39:59.089 --> 01:40:00.370]  There was a huge police presence.
[01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:04.075]  They had those little towers, you know, they jack up that you can see in Walmart parking lots now.
[01:40:04.475 --> 01:40:05.656]  They had those all over the place.
[01:40:05.696 --> 01:40:13.806]  And then we saw like you saw the militarized looking police from like Ferguson standing in the window watching on as well.
[01:40:14.346 --> 01:40:22.411]  These guys came out, that you can see right here, they came out to pray and they wanted to do it in front of everyone to show that they're being peaceful and, you know, they don't mean any harm.
[01:40:22.791 --> 01:40:24.252]  They just want to be a part of the community.
[01:40:24.572 --> 01:40:43.083]  And one of the other things I thought was interesting as well, one of the keynote speakers came up and he says, I'm thankful that I can live in a country where freedom of speech is protected, where I'm allowed to come out and have a rally to help bring awareness to what it is we're trying to do to be a peaceful part of the society in Garland.
[01:40:43.983 --> 01:40:50.966]  Well, that's what the Dutch mayor, who's a Muslim, said, is if you don't appreciate freedom of speech and everything, you should get out of the country.
[01:40:51.306 --> 01:40:53.827]  Well, the same thing goes for Merkel, not just radical Muslims.
[01:40:54.307 --> 01:41:06.072]  What do you think of them banning even mainline political parties, protesting against open borders, and the forced importation of tens of millions of Muslims to create Balkanization by the left?
[01:41:06.872 --> 01:41:07.853]  They're banning free speech.
[01:41:07.873 --> 01:41:10.395]  I mean, even if you don't agree with these groups, they should have free speech.
[01:41:10.535 --> 01:41:11.175]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:11.215 --> 01:41:22.864]  I mean, even if I don't agree with what the other side's saying, I'm still glad I live in a country where they're able to have that opinion, they're able to voice it without being persecuted, you know, in a sense.
[01:41:23.124 --> 01:41:29.428]  I mean, I think it's great that we live in this kind of country, but some Americans need to understand what freedom of speech is.
[01:41:30.689 --> 01:41:31.110]  I agree.
[01:41:31.130 --> 01:41:41.612]  I don't want to make a big deal out of this, because I don't like to end fight, but if you can go re-pull me the articles that were claiming that this guy's a terrorist, that guy's a terrorist, I want to look at those when I get off air today, because...
[01:41:42.762 --> 01:41:47.406]  That's dangerous for people to say, known terrorists are at this event, to stir up people.
[01:41:47.606 --> 01:41:48.707]  Oh yeah, that's what they were saying.
[01:41:48.727 --> 01:41:50.409]  I know, I know.
[01:41:51.449 --> 01:41:58.235]  It's fun to hype up the Muslim threat and everything, I understand people like to do that, but this is all part of this divide and conquer strategy.
[01:41:58.776 --> 01:42:01.958]  And I think the borders are too open, we are bringing radical Muslims in, I'm against it.
[01:42:02.859 --> 01:42:06.362]  They're being allowed to fly around, they're being allowed to recruit, they're being allowed to train.
[01:42:06.963 --> 01:42:07.904]  I say go after them.
[01:42:08.484 --> 01:42:10.545]  Because that's training for military attacks.
[01:42:11.005 --> 01:42:11.685]  Clearly illegal.
[01:42:12.526 --> 01:42:18.028]  But the attempt to just let them attack and then create a fight with general Muslims is part of a larger plan.
[01:42:18.048 --> 01:42:20.108]  It's like, yeah, there are bad cops out there.
[01:42:20.429 --> 01:42:21.269]  They should be punished.
[01:42:21.289 --> 01:42:27.531]  But don't let George Soros fund $33 million to start a war on police that's meant to start civil unrest.
[01:42:27.551 --> 01:42:28.752]  That's so obvious.
[01:42:29.721 --> 01:42:37.509]  I mean, we said that back at the time that George Soros was behind it because we tracked the name of the groups, but what do you make of it coming out that he admits that he's behind the anti-police stuff?
[01:42:37.789 --> 01:42:38.750]  That's pretty obvious.
[01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:40.972]  Yeah, I mean, that's mind-blowing to see all this.
[01:42:41.032 --> 01:42:45.977]  I mean, because you see people now... I mean, there's... I've been following some stuff in Jacksonville, Florida.
[01:42:46.257 --> 01:42:50.001]  They've been popping shots off at police officers, fire departments doing drive-bys.
[01:42:50.501 --> 01:42:54.305]  I mean, it's happening all over the place because of this cop phobia that's now happening.
[01:42:54.866 --> 01:42:56.627]  You know, all police are bad that they're saying.
[01:42:56.988 --> 01:43:04.816]  I mean, a few bad apples out there, but if you look at the amount of police officers and the tens of thousands of calls they go on, they do pretty positive stuff.
[01:43:05.196 --> 01:43:09.421]  Well, the globalists want to federalize them and turn them into a paramilitary force that hates the public.
[01:43:09.961 --> 01:43:16.187]  So the globalists are funding idiots to attack them so the cops go into that psychology and call it a war zone.
[01:43:16.267 --> 01:43:18.970]  This is the plan and Soros admits it.
[01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:20.711]  It's illegal what he's doing.
[01:43:21.292 --> 01:43:27.137]  I guarantee you if I was funding 33 million and stirring up groups to go say deck the halls with dead cops I'd get arrested and I should.
[01:43:27.558 --> 01:43:30.140]  Soros is above the law because he runs the White House.
[01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:31.642]  The White House is doing this.
[01:43:31.862 --> 01:43:32.803]  The White House is running it.
[01:43:33.023 --> 01:43:33.764]  Joe Biggs, thank you.
[01:43:35.014 --> 01:43:39.957]  He's with us until five minutes in the next hour, and then we're going to be joined by the Food Babe.
[01:43:39.977 --> 01:43:43.939]  She's got her new book out, some really positive news on food freedom.
[01:43:44.319 --> 01:43:49.802]  One of the main fronts we can still have an effect, but I played this already at the start of the last hour.
[01:43:51.312 --> 01:43:55.175]  And that is the powerful video up on InfoWars.com.
[01:43:55.676 --> 01:44:04.623]  Americans think Martin Luther King just died, or was a Confederate general, or was the first African American to walk on the moon.
[01:44:04.643 --> 01:44:06.384]  I'm not going to play the whole video again.
[01:44:06.864 --> 01:44:08.405]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:44:08.726 --> 01:44:10.067]  These are not cherry-picked.
[01:44:11.499 --> 01:44:14.703]  I want to get into this with Mark Dice on Martin Luther King Day.
[01:44:15.104 --> 01:44:16.145]  MarkDice.com.
[01:44:16.185 --> 01:44:17.967]  He's an author and media critic.
[01:44:18.007 --> 01:44:20.350]  His new book's out inside the Illuminati.
[01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:21.612]  We'll tell you something about that as well.
[01:44:21.632 --> 01:44:25.817]  We'll have him back up in a few weeks to do a whole hour on the true history of the Illuminati.
[01:44:25.837 --> 01:44:27.339]  He's done a lot of research into it.
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:38.811]  First off, shifting gears back to what we just covered, a few minutes with us on the clash of civilizations, the radical Islamists that are being brought in.
[01:44:39.411 --> 01:44:50.883]  What do you make of this overall and George Soros' attempt to basically fund destabilization and ultimately attacks on police and private property?
[01:44:52.099 --> 01:45:02.963]  Well, it's the classic plan of the clash of civilizations to pit different groups against each other, basically to tap into the most primitive aspect of humanity's tribalism.
[01:45:03.543 --> 01:45:14.987]  And with the Martin Luther King video that you showed that you were talking about earlier, I just again wanted to continue to demonstrate how people are so ignorant and will believe just about anything that you tell them.
[01:45:15.007 --> 01:45:16.868]  And if I can walk up to people and state
[01:45:17.972 --> 01:45:18.072]  It's
[01:45:36.872 --> 01:45:37.433]  I think?
[01:45:58.166 --> 01:46:01.447]  That's unfortunately what's happened to most Americans' minds.
[01:46:01.527 --> 01:46:03.527]  I mean, they're literally not using them.
[01:46:03.907 --> 01:46:14.770]  The smartphone use, the obsession with the internet, the short-term thinking processes have basically been short-circuited, not dumping data into long-term memory.
[01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:18.211]  And by the way, all the research studies that you're talking about show that.
[01:46:18.471 --> 01:46:19.891]  You're not just making claims here.
[01:46:20.512 --> 01:46:21.692]  People are disassociating.
[01:46:21.712 --> 01:46:23.172]  They're becoming basically zombies.
[01:46:24.353 --> 01:46:25.333]  And you're not out there.
[01:46:26.263 --> 01:46:38.450]  Because we've talked about this before, to make yourself look smart and make them look dumb or cherry-picking, you're out there showing really what you ran into and just how much danger we're in.
[01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:47.515]  Because quite frankly, it is liberals, we found this in Austin, if you go to a conservative area, they're pretty informed, they're pretty smart compared to these people.
[01:46:48.095 --> 01:46:50.577]  So-called liberals are the...
[01:46:51.417 --> 01:46:57.723]  But they always think they're real smart, and MSNBC makes fun of dumb conservatives all day, who certainly exist.
[01:46:57.983 --> 01:47:13.998]  I'm not conservative or liberal, I'm into just freedom, libertarian, but this phenomenon of liberals being dumber than a lobotomized turkey or something, they're a very scary group, because they will vote however they're told to.
[01:47:14.963 --> 01:47:42.756]  That's why I'm demonstrating you know and I'm glad a few years ago some of your crew came out and we did a video together and they were probably stunned to see just how easy it was not only for me to demonstrate people signing the petitions for absurd legislation just stating a fact a fake fact that you tell them it's for their own good they'll sign a petition to repeal the Bill of Rights just complete insane ideas your camera crew got to see it my cameramen are absolutely stunned and you know we're talking earlier
[01:47:42.756 --> 01:47:42.996]  We're good.
[01:48:00.428 --> 01:48:03.030]  Discourse in America was different from what it is now.
[01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:05.932]  Generally coherent, serious, and rational.
[01:48:06.372 --> 01:48:11.896]  And then how under the governance of television, it has become shriveled and absurd.
[01:48:12.296 --> 01:48:30.068]  And he goes on to say that we have part of the reason for this is because we've been accustomed to its discontinuities so that we are no longer struck dumb as any sane person would be by a newscaster who having just reported that a nuclear war was inevitable goes on to say that we'll be right back after this word
[01:48:30.228 --> 01:48:30.989]  From Burger King.
[01:48:31.649 --> 01:48:40.195]  And one can hardly overestimate the damage that this juxtaposition does to our sense of the world as a serious place.
[01:48:40.756 --> 01:48:49.222]  He goes on to say that they keep everything brief, not to strain our attention, but to provide constant stimulation through variety, novelty.
[01:48:49.642 --> 01:48:50.643]  Action and movement.
[01:48:51.004 --> 01:48:59.012]  You are required to pay attention to no concept, no character, and no problem for more than a few seconds at a time.
[01:48:59.453 --> 01:49:01.335]  That bite size is best.
[01:49:01.715 --> 01:49:03.517]  The complexity must be avoided.
[01:49:04.306 --> 01:49:13.992]  Nuances are dispensable, and that qualifications impede a simple message, and visual stimulization is a substitute for thought.
[01:49:14.032 --> 01:49:16.954]  That's right, it's dumbed down to Republican, Democrat, Black, White.
[01:49:16.994 --> 01:49:18.735]  You're for the cops, you're against the cops.
[01:49:19.015 --> 01:49:27.341]  They want us all like automatons, with no subtlety, no qualifications, no deep understanding of history, until
[01:49:29.474 --> 01:49:31.616]  The general public are like dumb animals.
[01:49:31.696 --> 01:49:32.517]  It's so sad.
[01:49:32.958 --> 01:49:33.819]  They're so stupid.
[01:49:34.079 --> 01:49:35.520]  But they're also so vicious.
[01:49:36.101 --> 01:49:37.683]  They'll vote to take our guns in a minute.
[01:49:37.703 --> 01:49:39.224]  They'll vote to put us in a FEMA camp.
[01:49:39.545 --> 01:49:45.311]  You've gone out and had long discussions with liberals going, yeah, we're going to put the gun owners in forced labor camps.
[01:49:45.371 --> 01:49:46.212]  And they're like, oh, good.
[01:49:46.252 --> 01:49:46.932]  Yeah, I don't like them.
[01:49:47.513 --> 01:49:49.795]  These people are ready, Mark, to come take us and our families.
[01:49:50.735 --> 01:50:08.436]  I mean we have a generation of people who grew up on smartphones literally don't know by memory that the phone numbers of their friends or their families I mean most people under perhaps 30 25 remember before smartphones when you would actually memorize the phone numbers of your
[01:50:08.556 --> 01:50:09.337]  We're good to go.
[01:50:30.289 --> 01:50:55.459]  This is also an important day to highlight, as you know, the COINTELPRO program, the FBI's undercover provocateur program to literally, illegally infiltrate peaceful groups that were a threat and are a threat to the establishment because, as you know, as much of this audience knows, your audience is probably growing, but more new people sort of awakening up or coming of age, trying to
[01:50:55.919 --> 01:50:57.362]  Let's talk about it when we come back.
[01:50:57.442 --> 01:50:59.165]  Media analyst Mark Dice is our guest.
[01:50:59.225 --> 01:51:01.348]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.

[01:52:02.762 --> 01:52:05.523]  This is a serious topic for all men.
[01:52:05.903 --> 01:52:10.004]  Every single man listening may have a prostate problem if he lives long enough.
[01:52:10.364 --> 01:52:10.785]  That's right.
[01:52:11.225 --> 01:52:13.646]  All of us men may suffer from a prostate problem.
[01:52:13.966 --> 01:52:18.527]  Like urinating more often, waking at night to urinate, or problems with intimacy.

[01:53:33.664 --> 01:53:37.947]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.

[01:54:03.581 --> 01:54:17.067]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss.
[01:54:17.527 --> 01:54:19.908]  Alex Jones here, back live tomorrow night.
[01:54:19.948 --> 01:54:29.673]  We'll have the InfoWars Nightly News crew giving live, continued coverage, Mystery Science Theater style, talking over the liar-in-chief Obama, or during the long fake...
[01:54:30.593 --> 01:54:31.153]  Applauses.
[01:54:31.194 --> 01:54:39.318]  They'll be adding analysis, commentary, then a summary of the lies, fraud, deception, and basically enemy attack disinformation.
[01:54:39.358 --> 01:54:40.239]  That's tomorrow night.
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:44.702]  Coverage starts at 7, 8 p.m.
[01:54:45.022 --> 01:54:55.909]  They will then give live commentary over the address and then give comments after so that we can have articles written that night and videos breaking down the different lies that are involved.
[01:54:57.149 --> 01:54:58.910]  I don't want to dominate the process.
[01:54:58.990 --> 01:54:59.731]  I was thinking about
[01:55:01.923 --> 01:55:16.548]  Coming in after the State of the Union, after Jakari Jackson, David Knight, LeeAnn McAdoo give commentary during it, and then coming in at the end and doing 30 minutes breakdown at the end of it.
[01:55:17.328 --> 01:55:18.649]  Or maybe I should do it at the first.
[01:55:20.209 --> 01:55:22.890]  I just like to step aside and let them grow, which they've really been doing.
[01:55:23.190 --> 01:55:25.771]  David Knight does a wonderful job when he hosts the show.
[01:55:26.852 --> 01:55:27.632]  So that's coming up.
[01:55:27.992 --> 01:55:29.813]  Going back to Mark Deisch.
[01:55:30.942 --> 01:55:35.627]  Mark, I mean Martin Luther King said don't judge people on their color, judge them on what they stand for.
[01:55:36.328 --> 01:55:40.173]  I don't care what color you are if I like your music, I don't care what color you are if I like your restaurant, I'm gonna come eat there.
[01:55:41.074 --> 01:55:43.096]  I mean that's what free market's really all about.
[01:55:43.997 --> 01:55:46.900]  Free market of ideas, free market of choice, that's real diversity.
[01:55:47.754 --> 01:55:53.358]  Is that you're not hung up on what color somebody is, so, you know, you got a friend who's whatever, you know, go see a movie together or whatever.
[01:55:54.038 --> 01:55:57.400]  But now political correctness is just the opposite.
[01:55:57.420 --> 01:56:03.104]  It's all about what color you are and how you're a special group, you're protected, the opposite of what Martin Luther King said.
[01:56:04.064 --> 01:56:09.648]  And now we know why the FBI left Malcolm X alone when he was saying kill everybody.
[01:56:10.208 --> 01:56:14.511]  But as soon as he said no, all races should work together, that's when he got killed.
[01:56:15.316 --> 01:56:18.021]  And it really shows the system wants to divide and conquer.
[01:56:18.041 --> 01:56:20.505]  So, spend a few minutes on COINTELPRO.
[01:56:21.738 --> 01:56:51.418]  Yeah, I mean, the general public would think this is a conspiracy theory, but I mean, we know it's been declassified that the FBI had, and of course continues to have, despite their claims that they ended the program and apologized for it, but they were infiltrating and harassing, committing all sorts of illegal crimes, and to discredit, disrupt, and neutralize peaceful groups, particularly Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement, or anybody who was or continues to be... Because he didn't want to burn down the country!
[01:56:53.002 --> 01:56:59.981]  But meanwhile, violent groups are being supported, and meanwhile George Soros is pushing violence and rioting again.
[01:57:01.141 --> 01:57:14.704]  Yeah, we even saw J. Edgar Hoover, the infamous founder, father of the FBI, who contained an entire series of file cabinets of dirt on politicians so he could blackmail them into doing his bidding.
[01:57:15.204 --> 01:57:19.805]  He was obviously against any public figure, any musician.
[01:57:19.865 --> 01:57:28.527]  John Lennon, he wanted to have him deported because he was such a powerful anti-war spokesman and face against the Vietnam War.
[01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:30.628]  Again, that was an establishment program.
[01:57:30.708 --> 01:57:33.228]  And they finally shut him down.
[01:57:34.349 --> 01:57:37.889]  Before he was going to present damning evidence in Parliament, shot in the head.
[01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:39.670]  The government says it was a suicide.
[01:57:39.890 --> 01:57:57.953]  Or, just breaking in InfoWars.com, the maker of, he was making anti-globalist, anti-establishment movies, found dead in an apparent murder-suicide with his wife and child, was working on a project envisioning future federal martial law crackdown.
[01:57:58.373 --> 01:57:59.433]  How suspicious is that?
[01:58:01.229 --> 01:58:22.648]  Well, I mean, we know there's a series of Operation, you know, false flag attacks, we know, and I don't even like to talk about some of the actual details of some of their programs like The Devil's Breath, Schipolamine, I mean, they literally have a powder that they can just blow into somebody's face and they'll turn into a conscious, appearing conscious zombie that will literally do anything that they tell them.
[01:58:22.688 --> 01:58:24.229]  We'll talk about that when we come back in one minute.
[01:58:24.249 --> 01:58:30.894]  I'm going to get you back for a full hour next week to talk about your new book, Inside the Illuminati.
[01:58:30.934 --> 01:58:31.774]  It's an excellent new book.
[01:58:32.035 --> 01:58:32.835]  We're not selling it.
[01:58:32.855 --> 01:58:35.437]  We need to get them in bulk and sell them at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:35.677 --> 01:58:37.098]  You can find those at Amazon.com.
[01:58:37.118 --> 01:58:37.819]  It's a new book.
[01:58:38.159 --> 01:58:38.599]  Stay with us.
[01:58:38.639 --> 01:58:39.520]  Back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:40.521]  And our other guest is coming on.

[02:00:26.337 --> 02:00:27.137]  Scopolamine.
[02:00:27.877 --> 02:00:28.638]  Gabble's breath.
[02:00:30.058 --> 02:00:32.780]  They've done it in Latin America and Haiti for a long time.
[02:00:34.056 --> 02:00:35.461]  They'll spray the powder in your face.
[02:00:35.482 --> 02:00:36.746]  There's different types.
[02:00:36.827 --> 02:00:37.690]  One comes from a plant.
[02:00:38.232 --> 02:00:39.216]  Others from a puffer fish.
[02:00:41.550 --> 02:00:46.132]  Paralyzes you, you think you're a zombie, they dig you up later, tell you that you're under their control.
[02:00:46.152 --> 02:00:49.854]  Then they give you the other drug to make you follow all their orders.
[02:00:50.815 --> 02:00:52.936]  People will kill their children when ordered to.
[02:00:53.596 --> 02:00:55.497]  They will go in and rob banks when they're told to.
[02:00:56.257 --> 02:00:58.618]  And that's just an ancient system they have.
[02:00:58.638 --> 02:01:02.160]  There's a lot of high-tech drugs and things that are perfect for mind control.
[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:07.483]  Sirhan Sirhan was on these when he was the decoy in the shooting of RFK.
[02:01:09.241 --> 02:01:16.006]  But going back to Mark Dice, Mark, tell us about Devil's Breath and just an example of how easy it is to mind control someone.
[02:01:17.368 --> 02:01:18.849]  Now, we know the power of suggestion.
[02:01:18.949 --> 02:01:33.921]  My video series demonstrates just for me repeatedly telling people to print their name and pointing on the crazy petitions to disrupt their thought patterns, to direct them to what I want them to do, using really a form of neuro-linguistic programming in a sense.
[02:01:34.725 --> 02:01:56.711]  That is quite powerful in and of itself, but you add drugs into the mix, and this scopolamine, it's a very little-known drug, nicknamed the Devil's Breath, often rumored to just be a conspiracy theory again, but confirmed to be a real substance that, of course, the CIA has experimented and used in their now-declassified MKUltra mind-control programs, which
[02:01:57.051 --> 02:02:11.644]  Literally turns a person into a conscious zombie, where they, to an uninformed person, appear to be fully conscious and aware of themselves and their surroundings, but they are essentially turned into a hypnotic slave.
[02:02:12.245 --> 02:02:18.731]  And there's been many cases of individuals, not even associated with the government, just organized criminals or rogue criminal elements,
[02:02:19.191 --> 02:02:35.432]  Using scopolamine devil's breath to then get people to go and empty out their bank accounts because they will walk into a bank After being told to an empty out their bank account or their ATM They'll just let him into their house and tell them, you know, just give them some of their jewels, etc This is one of them
[02:02:40.618 --> 02:02:41.258]  What's going on?
[02:03:00.609 --> 02:03:29.667]  You know we always talk about they control the media or trying to get more detailed the establishment but as a media analyst I mean I can tell you that there's an entire division in the entertainment industry that literally works and you know this with the Department of Defense there's on the CIA's website there is a whole page about the Entertainment Liaison Office that works hand-in-hand with Hollywood to create these propaganda films like this new number one film American Sniper this new war propaganda
[02:03:29.687 --> 02:03:29.987]  I think?
[02:03:49.188 --> 02:03:51.549]  It just does what the television tells them to.
[02:03:52.109 --> 02:04:05.955]  We have multiple cases of these strange experiments on the public from Operation Midnight Climax, dosing people with LSD, to the scopolamine uses, to the use of hypnotic neuro-linguistic programming, and so it's no wonder why society is falling apart.
[02:04:07.355 --> 02:04:13.678]  And out of that research came Prozac, and the rest of it, where you're not obviously on LSD, but it's in the same family.
[02:04:14.038 --> 02:04:18.400]  You're in a highly suggestible, mesmerized, mind-control state.
[02:04:19.597 --> 02:04:21.998]  And this is what's happening to society.
[02:04:22.878 --> 02:04:42.245]  You can see in some of the previous Man on the Street petition series where I would ask these people to sign a petition to repeal the Bill of Rights, and sometimes they may start thinking about the issue before signing, and I just, using, again, just an easy form of neuro-linguistic programming, the power of suggestion, interrupt their thought processes and just give them a command.
[02:04:42.825 --> 02:04:46.167]  In a confident voice to tell them, just sign right here.
[02:04:46.467 --> 02:04:49.469]  I just need you to sign right here in a commanding, confident voice.
[02:04:49.789 --> 02:04:50.950]  And I'm not even wearing a suit.
[02:04:50.970 --> 02:04:54.171]  I don't have a big backdrop with some theatrical music.
[02:04:54.251 --> 02:04:55.112]  That's right, Mark.
[02:04:55.332 --> 02:04:57.253]  You're showing folks the man behind the curtain.
[02:04:57.293 --> 02:04:57.993]  Great job.
[02:04:58.394 --> 02:04:59.634]  Look forward to talking to you next week.
[02:04:59.694 --> 02:05:00.255]  God bless.
[02:05:00.575 --> 02:05:00.875]  Thank you.
[02:05:03.871 --> 02:05:07.374]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:07.534 --> 02:05:11.497]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:11.797 --> 02:05:13.258]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:13.578 --> 02:05:21.164]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:21.444 --> 02:05:22.285]  But for how long?
[02:05:22.585 --> 02:05:28.829]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:05:29.230 --> 02:05:32.032]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:05:33.427 --> 02:05:36.649]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:05:36.949 --> 02:05:44.954]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:05:45.194 --> 02:05:50.218]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:06:03.672 --> 02:06:12.339]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:22.668]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[02:06:23.209 --> 02:06:29.274]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:06:29.614 --> 02:06:35.779]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:06:36.019 --> 02:06:44.205]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[02:06:44.646 --> 02:06:47.428]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:06:47.708 --> 02:06:48.869]  No needles, no injections.
[02:06:49.249 --> 02:06:50.530]  Don't take my word for it.

[02:07:03.641 --> 02:07:04.861]  Another major health threat.
[02:07:04.881 --> 02:07:09.783]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:07:09.863 --> 02:07:12.504]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:07:12.544 --> 02:07:19.306]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:07:19.586 --> 02:07:22.447]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:07:22.587 --> 02:07:25.508]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:07:25.528 --> 02:07:27.508]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:07:27.548 --> 02:07:30.349]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:07:30.469 --> 02:07:35.971]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:07:36.191 --> 02:07:39.693]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:07:39.713 --> 02:07:42.694]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:07:42.794 --> 02:07:49.897]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[02:08:00.562 --> 02:08:07.487]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:25.831 --> 02:08:30.573]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:33.333 --> 02:08:37.575]  There's a lot of breaking news at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:08:37.595 --> 02:08:41.316]  We're going to get to it about 45 after our guest leaves us.
[02:08:42.316 --> 02:08:46.257]  There's also a news story or two that I didn't get to Friday that I've got to get to.
[02:08:46.718 --> 02:08:53.920]  The minute I saw this Friday morning, Holder had made the announcement the night before, the Attorney General, who was supposed to be gone six months ago.
[02:08:54.773 --> 02:08:58.975]  Because of Fast and Furious and all his other activities, the IRS persecuting people.
[02:08:59.956 --> 02:09:06.179]  The minute I saw it on television while I was on the elliptical, I knew what the body would be.
[02:09:06.839 --> 02:09:07.960]  Because I just know their tactics.
[02:09:09.061 --> 02:09:12.682]  And sure enough, I went up, got the New York Times, and here it was.
[02:09:14.163 --> 02:09:19.846]  It's the feds that got Asset Forfeiture Seizure laws passed federally to begin with, that the states then copied 40 years ago.
[02:09:20.887 --> 02:09:23.048]  They run the war on drugs and also ship the drugs in.
[02:09:24.665 --> 02:09:25.085]  On record.
[02:09:27.426 --> 02:09:51.793]  So I knew that the feds lobbied states to get rid of their asset forwards or seizure systems in the last 10 years showing cases of corrupt police robbing people in non-crime related events as a pretext to get rid of the state programs so they could then have police see stuff but go through the federal program to get up to 85% of the money back, thus federalizing police.
[02:09:53.154 --> 02:09:54.534]  And the goal is federalized police.
[02:09:54.654 --> 02:09:56.275]  So I'm going to show you how my thought process works.
[02:09:57.115 --> 02:10:07.376]  So I waddle back from the gym, go pull up what the Attorney General actually did, what he said in his statement, because it's open-ended, and it was exactly what I thought.
[02:10:08.537 --> 02:10:10.137]  And I'm not bragging that I'm smart.
[02:10:10.197 --> 02:10:12.697]  I'm saying they follow a criminal program.
[02:10:15.338 --> 02:10:21.779]  It goes on to say that it has to be firearms or ammunition or explosives.
[02:10:23.598 --> 02:10:25.740]  Or they won't accept it and then give them money back.
[02:10:27.101 --> 02:10:29.023]  The Corvettes, or houses, or whatever they're stealing.
[02:10:29.403 --> 02:10:34.828]  So now they're going to asset forfeiture seizure for guns they claim are illegal.
[02:10:35.549 --> 02:10:40.533]  You know, if somebody in the house is a felon and they're your guns, they're going to say it's the felon's gun to take your house.
[02:10:40.613 --> 02:10:43.395]  I mean, this is their anti-gun initiative.
[02:10:43.415 --> 02:10:44.176]  They said they'd do it.
[02:10:44.596 --> 02:10:49.781]  So, hold her to use asset forfeiture seizure to go after guns.
[02:10:49.821 --> 02:10:50.662]  That's the real headline.
[02:10:51.783 --> 02:10:53.864]  But then it goes on, now here's the real key.
[02:10:54.964 --> 02:11:00.465]  The new policy, notice it's a policy, not a law, it's how they interpret it.
[02:11:01.026 --> 02:11:17.970]  Just like the Justice Department told the IRS five years ago, if somebody makes more than 14 in a year, look it up, less than $1,000 deposits in their bank account, that's structuring and you can take their bank account, no charges.
[02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:21.051]  In fact, show the New York Times on that, folks won't believe me.
[02:11:23.550 --> 02:11:28.472]  In fact, in some cases, as little as 10 deposits in a year, they would do it.
[02:11:30.633 --> 02:11:37.535]  Well, the woman for 40-something years owned a tiny diner, never made more than $1,000, deposited her money, paid tax on it.
[02:11:38.396 --> 02:11:50.140]  In America, that's not good enough because the policy says, Obama has a policy to shut down power plants, a policy to teach your 5-year-old how to wear a dress, your 5-year-old boy.
[02:11:50.933 --> 02:11:54.874]  They have a policy to teach kids how to masturbate, since you jostle on elders.
[02:11:56.134 --> 02:11:57.894]  There's no law, it's a policy.
[02:11:58.915 --> 02:11:59.455]  Well, here it is.
[02:11:59.975 --> 02:12:11.817]  The new policy does not affect asset seizures made under joint state and federal operations, and local law enforcement may still seize property under state laws, which have been changed.
[02:12:13.537 --> 02:12:16.398]  So see, when you know the law and you read this, it's a joke.
[02:12:19.997 --> 02:12:24.600]  So what they're saying is, you gotta be totally federalized, or you can't have asset forfeiture seizure.
[02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:31.064]  Or, guns will let you, in our program, say it's okay to take somebody's house or car.
[02:12:31.604 --> 02:12:32.725]  Oh, you have an illegal gun?
[02:12:33.965 --> 02:12:36.707]  This receiver is improper under our regulations.
[02:12:37.808 --> 02:12:39.208]  We're going to take your car.
[02:12:44.612 --> 02:12:48.234]  It's like the cases in New York, where the cops, it turned out, were running the hookers.
[02:12:49.141 --> 02:12:51.902]  But they were still taking people's cars that they were busting.
[02:12:52.083 --> 02:12:56.065]  They would just randomly bust people that had nice cars because they wanted to take the car, too.
[02:12:56.345 --> 02:12:59.286]  It's like it's not enough you paid the cops for the hooker they were pimping.
[02:12:59.607 --> 02:13:01.488]  Now the cop gets your car, too?
[02:13:05.170 --> 02:13:05.950]  Remember the D.C.
[02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:07.431]  cops got caught?
[02:13:07.511 --> 02:13:08.892]  This was in the Washington Post.
[02:13:08.932 --> 02:13:10.412]  I couldn't believe it when I read it like 10 years ago.
[02:13:11.313 --> 02:13:16.776]  Towing cars from McDonald's parking lots that were parked legally, in uniform, on duty, and the cops
[02:13:18.138 --> 02:13:20.020]  Own their own tow truck company.
[02:13:21.981 --> 02:13:25.223]  And people will come out and say, hey man, you're taking my car, I'm parked legally.
[02:13:25.404 --> 02:13:26.664]  The cops will pull guns on them.
[02:13:26.684 --> 02:13:27.785]  That's who needs to be indicted.
[02:13:31.028 --> 02:13:35.191]  This is the general corruption, though, of the society that we've let happen.
[02:13:35.271 --> 02:13:35.991]  Look in the mirror.
[02:13:36.252 --> 02:13:37.112]  This is our fault.
[02:13:37.493 --> 02:13:40.335]  So see, oh, Holder's doing something about asset forward seizure.
[02:13:40.735 --> 02:13:41.636]  Oh, isn't he nice?
[02:13:44.358 --> 02:13:47.280]  It's the feds that authored this form of piracy.
[02:13:51.069 --> 02:13:57.954]  Holder limits seized assets sharing process that split billions with local state police.
[02:13:59.876 --> 02:14:00.936]  Alright, enough of that.
[02:14:01.016 --> 02:14:03.398]  I've got so much other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:14:03.418 --> 02:14:04.299]  We're going to cover it all.
[02:14:04.739 --> 02:14:07.581]  But joining us... Guys, you hand me her book.
[02:14:07.621 --> 02:14:08.562]  It's over there on that table.
[02:14:08.582 --> 02:14:08.922]  Thank you.
[02:14:08.942 --> 02:14:10.443]  Sorry, I can't get up now that I'm live.
[02:14:11.864 --> 02:14:15.307]  Vani Hari, also known as the Food Babe at foodbabe.com.
[02:14:15.827 --> 02:14:20.031]  She's got her new book out, Break Free from the Hidden Toxins in Your Food.
[02:14:21.053 --> 02:14:24.255]  And lose weight, look years younger and get healthier in just 21 days.
[02:14:24.275 --> 02:14:26.436]  I look forward to reading this book.
[02:14:27.697 --> 02:14:30.699]  I'm still not super healthy, but I've gotten a lot healthier than I was four or five years ago.
[02:14:31.219 --> 02:14:32.200]  Lost over 50 pounds.
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:33.400]  Didn't lose another 10 or 15.
[02:14:33.580 --> 02:14:35.341]  Those last ones that are really tough.
[02:14:36.642 --> 02:14:42.626]  But I've done that with the InfoWarsHealth.com and InfoWarsLife.com, family of products and moderate exercise.
[02:14:43.373 --> 02:14:46.495]  But I didn't have the right vitamins and minerals, and I wasn't eating completely right.
[02:14:46.536 --> 02:14:47.356]  I'm still not perfect.
[02:14:47.656 --> 02:14:49.198]  And so that's why the rest of the weight wasn't coming off.
[02:14:49.218 --> 02:14:49.838]  Well, it is now.
[02:14:50.379 --> 02:14:58.165]  So with Infowarslife.com, Infowarshealth.com, with moderate exercise, with some of the techniques she's come up with as well, it's achievable.
[02:14:58.185 --> 02:14:59.266]  It's just not going to happen overnight.
[02:15:00.366 --> 02:15:03.189]  But I wanted to get her on and talk about her book, but also some of the news.
[02:15:04.614 --> 02:15:05.014]  out there.
[02:15:05.394 --> 02:15:07.295]  We have a story on Infowars.com.
[02:15:07.615 --> 02:15:11.756]  Don't worry, USDA says pesticide-laden food is safe to eat.
[02:15:12.256 --> 02:15:21.198]  EPA has determined the extremely low levels of those residues are not a food safety risk, just like they think fluoride's okay, even though the majority of their scientists have gone public saying it's deadly.
[02:15:22.118 --> 02:15:30.220]  And then it goes into the fact that they're even using fluoride as a pesticide, and the EPA should take it out four years ago, but it still hasn't been done.
[02:15:31.556 --> 02:15:32.837]  So we're going to talk about that.
[02:15:32.857 --> 02:15:34.618]  We're going to get into her latest project.
[02:15:34.638 --> 02:15:38.900]  She's been very successful, thanks to listeners of this show and other folks getting involved.
[02:15:39.420 --> 02:15:42.581]  This Frito-Lay organic product sent shockwaves through me.
[02:15:43.342 --> 02:15:46.804]  Help get it everywhere is the headline.
[02:15:46.824 --> 02:15:50.645]  She'll break down what that means from her website foodbabe.com.
[02:15:51.106 --> 02:15:52.906]  So Foodbabe, great to have you on with us.
[02:15:53.327 --> 02:15:56.888]  We'll get into the book some, but let's get into this Frito-Lay situation first.
[02:15:57.449 --> 02:15:57.749]  Yeah.
[02:15:59.753 --> 02:16:00.793]  I'm excited to be back.
[02:16:01.654 --> 02:16:11.076]  So a few months ago, I was traveling, I was in California, great state of California, so many access, you know, we have, there's so much access to organic food there.
[02:16:11.656 --> 02:16:17.018]  And I walked into a Costco and I was touring it and I was looking around and I tell you,
[02:16:18.318 --> 02:16:20.619]  I was freaking flipped out when I saw this product.
[02:16:20.659 --> 02:16:23.840]  And I actually have it here today because I took it with me.
[02:16:23.940 --> 02:16:26.881]  But it's an organic bag of Frito-Lay.
[02:16:26.901 --> 02:16:33.983]  This is like the first organic certified product that Frito-Lay has put about.
[02:16:34.503 --> 02:16:36.864]  And the only reason I was able to find this
[02:16:37.424 --> 02:16:54.011]  It's because some unsung heroes are working at Costco internally to get these types of products to their members, which is unheard of considering the amount of money and influence that PepsiCo, who owns Frito-Lay, has spent.
[02:16:55.231 --> 02:17:14.159]  Against our right to know has spent over eight million dollars preventing Americans from knowing what's in our food and also preventing Transparency even though they provide the same transparency to over 65 other countries and citizens across the globe So this is a company that specializes in junk food.
[02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:24.324]  They they produce Pepsi Cola They produce a lot of chips and so for to see this organic product for the first time in my life there it was a
[02:17:24.984 --> 02:17:40.732]  It gave me a really warm, fuzzy feeling inside, like, wow, we can even change these giant companies that I spend all day, you know, talking to people not to buy, and now they're coming out with organic products.
[02:17:40.792 --> 02:17:44.894]  And why this is so important is for a couple reasons.
[02:17:45.134 --> 02:17:50.837]  First of all, going from conventional farming, conventional potatoes to organic
[02:17:52.072 --> 02:17:57.317]  Potatoes makes a significant impact on the environment.
[02:17:57.737 --> 02:18:01.000]  Number one, it produces more sustainable farming.
[02:18:01.141 --> 02:18:07.707]  So the farmers who deal with these toxic pesticides that they put on conventional potatoes go away.
[02:18:07.987 --> 02:18:09.989]  The synthetic pesticides go away.
[02:18:10.369 --> 02:18:13.192]  The Environmental Working Group has stated that there can be 35 different
[02:18:14.813 --> 02:18:18.574]  types of synthetic pesticides found on a typical potato.
[02:18:18.914 --> 02:18:25.336]  And potatoes actually retain the most amount of pesticides per weight out of any other fruit and vegetable.
[02:18:25.676 --> 02:18:27.756]  So think about that.
[02:18:27.776 --> 02:18:37.739]  35 different pesticides, many of them linked to being a carcinogen, being endocrine disruptors, being linked to fertility issues, all sorts of problems.
[02:18:37.879 --> 02:18:42.640]  And potatoes are one of the number one crop that people eat in this country.
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:42.880]  I mean,
[02:18:43.300 --> 02:18:47.286]  Chips are a way of life, whether they're healthy or not, or whether they're organic or not.
[02:18:47.606 --> 02:18:48.688]  People are going to eat chips.
[02:18:48.768 --> 02:18:49.949]  It's part of our culture.
[02:18:50.029 --> 02:18:51.572]  We've got Super Bowl coming up.
[02:18:51.972 --> 02:18:59.442]  And so that's why when I saw this product available at Costco, but not anywhere else, I felt like it was my mission.
[02:19:00.407 --> 02:19:04.089]  To tell people about it, but also to tell people that, you know what?
[02:19:04.469 --> 02:19:08.371]  We should ask Frito-Lay to produce this everywhere.
[02:19:08.751 --> 02:19:16.994]  They should be requiring their conventional farms to move over to organic and start producing organic potato chips for everyone.
[02:19:17.115 --> 02:19:18.435]  Absolutely, it'd be a big hit.
[02:19:18.495 --> 02:19:20.336]  I mean, I was in a restaurant, you see it in stores.
[02:19:21.156 --> 02:19:24.458]  Organic Heinz, they're advertising it, non-GMO.
[02:19:25.038 --> 02:19:26.399]  So what they're doing is they're fighting
[02:19:27.459 --> 02:19:37.311]  From their competition Labeling while they selectively move to beta test the market and now we have Chuck Norris We're going to break but Chuck Norris has come out
[02:19:38.539 --> 02:19:41.942]  against Monsanto, and we'll cover some of that when we come back.
[02:19:42.543 --> 02:19:49.229]  And that's good, because they want to keep it a liberal-conservative issue, where conservatives are for guns, liberals are against GMO.
[02:19:49.930 --> 02:19:50.370]  Well, no.
[02:19:50.510 --> 02:19:52.092]  I mean, Chuck Norris doesn't want to die.
[02:19:52.112 --> 02:19:53.593]  He doesn't want his kids eating pesticides.
[02:19:54.094 --> 02:19:56.816]  He knows that the Monsanto BT's killing honeybees.
[02:19:57.317 --> 02:19:59.099]  Chuck Norris is a health expert.
[02:19:59.579 --> 02:20:02.102]  He looks like he's 20 years younger than he is, and he's smart.
[02:20:03.343 --> 02:20:05.904]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[02:20:06.045 --> 02:20:10.047]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[02:20:10.347 --> 02:20:11.588]  Silverlungs.com.

[02:21:04.583 --> 02:21:09.207]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool, a pair of scissors.
[02:21:09.587 --> 02:21:15.092]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[02:21:15.372 --> 02:21:20.016]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[02:21:20.276 --> 02:21:21.096]  The phone line.
[02:21:21.277 --> 02:21:26.179]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[02:21:26.519 --> 02:21:30.301]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[02:21:30.441 --> 02:21:33.323]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[02:24:25.700 --> 02:24:28.703]  Bonnie Hari, the food babe, is our guest.
[02:24:30.144 --> 02:24:32.046]  And I mentioned Chuck Norris.
[02:24:32.226 --> 02:24:42.636]  He's been critical of GMOs before, and he's a big conservative leader, writing for WorldNetDaily, frustrated over health risk from world's most popular weed killer.
[02:24:44.538 --> 02:24:48.822]  And he goes on to break down glyphosate and what it's being used in.
[02:24:50.243 --> 02:24:57.326]  And how 180 million pounds of glyphosate are being used basically every few years on the crops.
[02:24:57.806 --> 02:24:58.606]  That was in 2007.
[02:24:58.646 --> 02:25:01.767]  The latest numbers we have was 185 million pounds.
[02:25:02.488 --> 02:25:04.128]  And he just goes through what it does.
[02:25:05.429 --> 02:25:07.489]  And it's a major endocrine disruptor.
[02:25:08.530 --> 02:25:10.351]  They admit it gives women breast cancer.
[02:25:12.271 --> 02:25:13.512]  So every time I go to a store,
[02:25:14.631 --> 02:25:15.692]  Not every time, but all the time.
[02:25:15.712 --> 02:25:21.598]  They go, would you like to get this drink, this martini that's for breast cancer?
[02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:27.103]  Would you like to give two dollars when you're checking out at Walgreens for breast cancer?
[02:25:27.524 --> 02:25:29.065]  I go, you know what?
[02:25:29.145 --> 02:25:31.187]  I'd like to get glyphosate out of the water supply.
[02:25:31.668 --> 02:25:32.989]  That's what grows the breast tumors.
[02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:35.572]  Sir, you don't care about women?
[02:25:36.932 --> 02:25:38.493]  We know what's causing it.
[02:25:38.593 --> 02:25:40.694]  Why should I go give money to find a cure?
[02:25:40.714 --> 02:25:43.596]  The cure is don't get it to begin with.
[02:25:44.316 --> 02:25:47.578]  Glyphosate basically will destroy your prostate and your testicles.
[02:25:48.999 --> 02:25:50.060]  You think I want cancer?
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:51.601]  You think I want my kids having cancer?
[02:25:54.462 --> 02:25:55.823]  This is not a partisan issue.
[02:25:55.863 --> 02:25:56.504]  It's crazy!
[02:25:57.564 --> 02:26:00.486]  Monsanto's the Agent Orange folks, the dioxin people.
[02:26:02.367 --> 02:26:05.189]  And they can lobby government to authorize whatever they want.
[02:26:05.959 --> 02:26:06.460]  I'm ranting.
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:07.381]  This is a short segment.
[02:26:07.421 --> 02:26:10.304]  Vani, how big a deal is it to have Chuck Norris and others?
[02:26:10.364 --> 02:26:15.930]  I mean, I really see the momentum against this whole toxic industry turning up.
[02:26:16.010 --> 02:26:16.891]  They're striking back.
[02:26:16.911 --> 02:26:21.155]  But as you said, all over the world, they're banning this stuff or restricting it or labeling it.
[02:26:21.596 --> 02:26:25.280]  Here, we seem to be the dumping ground of everything horrible.
[02:26:26.288 --> 02:26:32.553]  It really is and you know this potato issue is really at the heart of that because we consume so many potatoes.
[02:26:32.593 --> 02:26:33.814]  Let me just give you an example.
[02:26:35.115 --> 02:26:47.165]  80% of the world's conventional or the United States conventional potatoes contains this bud nip herbicide and what that does is it prevents that little sprouting from occurring in your potatoes.
[02:26:47.685 --> 02:26:52.269]  You buy organic potatoes, so you see when you leave them on the counter for a really long time, they start to sprout.
[02:26:52.529 --> 02:26:56.693]  Well, they're supposed to sprout because it tells you that they're bad and you need to buy some new ones.
[02:26:56.773 --> 02:27:01.036]  But they're actually putting this chemical on potatoes to make them last longer.
[02:27:01.116 --> 02:27:05.900]  And this chemical is linked to all sorts of health issues according to animal studies.
[02:27:06.661 --> 02:27:15.326]  That's why it's so important to require these people that have figured out how to make organic potato chips, the biggest manufacturer in the world, to do this.
[02:27:15.507 --> 02:27:23.972]  And people can sign this letter that I sent to the CEO of Pepsi and the CEO of Frito-Lay today, this morning, at foodbabe.com slash Frito-Lay.
[02:27:24.452 --> 02:27:25.914]  Send your letter along with me.
[02:27:26.054 --> 02:27:27.456]  Post it to their Facebook page.
[02:27:27.517 --> 02:27:28.558]  Go to their Twitter accounts.
[02:27:29.039 --> 02:27:29.700]  Ask for this.
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:38.031]  It will make a huge difference in the amount of glyphosate, the amount of herbicides, the amount of pesticides, the amount of fungicides that are in our environment.
[02:27:38.051 --> 02:27:39.513]  And that's why I'm doing this action.
[02:27:39.553 --> 02:27:41.196]  But one other thing you mentioned, Alex.
[02:27:41.656 --> 02:27:52.480]  That's so important is that government regulation, that people are lobbying the government to do certain things that are harmful to Americans and harmful to our environment.
[02:27:52.780 --> 02:27:58.142]  And one in particular issue that I just highlighted very recently on a blog post is red number three.
[02:27:58.302 --> 02:27:59.043]  We're good to go.
[02:28:15.146 --> 02:28:28.549]  They wrote some legislation when they were banning that chemical in cosmetics and in food, they wrote some legislation to be accepted in food and to have more studies involved even though it was already linked to cancer and animal studies.
[02:28:28.669 --> 02:28:32.690]  And this red number 3 can be found all over the grocery store.
[02:28:32.730 --> 02:28:36.491]  I'm talking about another PepsiCo product right here, Quaker Grits.
[02:28:36.911 --> 02:28:42.992]  This red number 3 that's banned in lipstick and cosmetics is in people's grits that they're eating for breakfast.
[02:28:43.072 --> 02:28:49.215]  And for folks who don't know, it has been positively, in so many studies, directly linked to behavioral problems in children.
[02:28:49.715 --> 02:28:55.138]  It has, from my research, correct me if I'm wrong, I know it's Red 5 as well, has an amphetamine type effect.
[02:28:55.953 --> 02:28:56.754]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:28:56.834 --> 02:28:58.536]  It causes hyperactivity.
[02:28:58.696 --> 02:29:00.218]  It affects brain function.
[02:29:00.278 --> 02:29:05.423]  They've shown that it can be contaminated with carcinogens, the way it's produced.
[02:29:05.703 --> 02:29:11.970]  I mean, this is also, in just about every salad bar across America, you'll see bacon bits on the salad bar.
[02:29:12.370 --> 02:29:13.812]  This is red number three.
[02:29:13.872 --> 02:29:15.534]  That's what makes these bacon bits.
[02:29:15.554 --> 02:29:16.695]  This is also what makes the
[02:29:16.815 --> 02:29:18.916]  Listen, I've learned it.
[02:29:18.956 --> 02:29:21.637]  If I eat those bacon bits years ago, I'd get a headache.
[02:29:21.658 --> 02:29:22.638]  I mean, it's simple.
[02:29:22.698 --> 02:29:25.640]  Anything processed, I get sick because it's chemicals.
[02:29:40.467 --> 02:29:43.991]  Petrochemicals in the McDonald's nuggets on record is plastic.
[02:29:44.391 --> 02:29:45.312]  They're allowed to do it.
[02:29:45.472 --> 02:29:47.014]  Well, I don't want kidney failure, folks.
[02:29:47.294 --> 02:29:47.955]  I'm not eating it.
[02:29:48.215 --> 02:29:48.976]  This isn't a game.
[02:29:49.016 --> 02:29:49.717]  It's not a joke.
[02:29:50.417 --> 02:29:50.898]  Stay with us.
[02:29:52.740 --> 02:29:53.661]  We're on the march.
[02:29:54.141 --> 02:29:55.763]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.684 --> 02:29:59.367]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.436 --> 02:30:10.358]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.
[02:30:10.638 --> 02:30:20.040]  At Infowars Life, our mission is to bring you the highest quality, purest, cleanest, effective colloidal silver on the market today for the lowest price available.
[02:30:20.260 --> 02:30:28.282]  You don't have to be a doctor to know the fall and winter months are the most dangerous time of year in North America when it comes to you and your family's health.
[02:30:28.522 --> 02:30:37.973]  Infowarslife.com is very excited to announce our biggest run yet of silver bullet colloidal silver exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.

[02:30:57.887 --> 02:30:58.387]  Silver Bullet.
[02:31:03.362 --> 02:31:10.428]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:31:10.529 --> 02:31:12.690]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:31:12.871 --> 02:31:17.975]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:31:18.155 --> 02:31:23.100]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:31:23.320 --> 02:31:26.361]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:31:26.641 --> 02:31:30.482]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:31:30.702 --> 02:31:34.943]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:31:35.023 --> 02:31:45.026]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:31:45.266 --> 02:31:47.767]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:31:48.107 --> 02:31:56.040]  Manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:31:56.180 --> 02:32:00.147]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:04.412 --> 02:32:05.493]  In the near future.
[02:32:05.753 --> 02:32:09.395]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:32:09.415 --> 02:32:09.895]  Security alert.
[02:32:10.256 --> 02:32:11.256]  Security alert.
[02:32:11.476 --> 02:32:13.197]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:32:13.477 --> 02:32:14.098]  Analysis.
[02:32:14.378 --> 02:32:15.018]  InfoWars.
[02:32:15.078 --> 02:32:17.020]  Building independent media operations.
[02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:22.043]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:32:22.063 --> 02:32:22.983]  Crime Directive.
[02:32:23.103 --> 02:32:24.524]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:32:24.644 --> 02:32:27.426]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:32:27.506 --> 02:32:30.568]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:32:30.748 --> 02:32:32.909]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:32:33.029 --> 02:32:34.530]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:36.851]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:32:37.391 --> 02:32:39.072]  They are never going to stop.
[02:32:39.332 --> 02:32:43.234]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:32:43.415 --> 02:32:46.556]  Block free iPhone app at InfoWars.com.
[02:32:46.976 --> 02:32:49.638]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[02:32:50.338 --> 02:32:51.079]  Imperative.
[02:32:51.319 --> 02:32:53.340]  Destroy Prison Senate TV.
[02:32:53.360 --> 02:32:57.782]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:32:58.062 --> 02:33:00.184]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[02:33:13.798 --> 02:33:17.679]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:18.579 --> 02:33:23.540]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.801 --> 02:33:29.302]  Broadcasting worldwide, I am your host,
[02:33:30.782 --> 02:33:32.704]  Here's from Mercola's site, Dr. Mercola.
[02:33:32.804 --> 02:33:35.487]  Are you or your family eating toxic food dyes?
[02:33:36.148 --> 02:33:37.149]  Since we mentioned this.
[02:33:37.850 --> 02:33:38.851]  Brilliant 1.
[02:33:39.932 --> 02:33:40.613]  Blue 1.
[02:33:42.555 --> 02:33:43.956]  And then it goes through what it does.
[02:33:43.976 --> 02:33:44.677]  Indigo.
[02:33:44.777 --> 02:33:45.017]  Blue 2.
[02:33:45.538 --> 02:33:46.719]  Citrus Red 2.
[02:33:48.902 --> 02:33:50.724]  Oh, causes tumors in the bladder.
[02:33:50.764 --> 02:33:51.585]  That's always fun.
[02:33:53.826 --> 02:34:03.730]  Another study, RED-3, recognized in 1990 by the FDA as a thyroid carcinogen in animals and is banned in cosmetics and externally applied drugs.
[02:34:04.011 --> 02:34:04.451]  What is it?
[02:34:06.872 --> 02:34:07.412]  What's it in?
[02:34:07.512 --> 02:34:14.215]  Sausage casings, oral medication, maraschino cherries, baked goods, candies.
[02:34:15.256 --> 02:34:15.496]  RED-40!
[02:34:15.816 --> 02:34:20.238]  It just goes through all the wonderful things that this stuff does to you.
[02:34:22.389 --> 02:34:32.792]  If my children get any of those cherries, like if they go to a yogurt place for frozen yogurt, I can always tell, I'll go, oh my gosh, you're bouncing off the walls, let me look at your tongue.
[02:34:33.913 --> 02:34:38.714]  And they stick their tongues out, and they go, yeah, we had cherries, or we had red candy, and I'm just like, oh my gosh.
[02:34:39.234 --> 02:34:43.956]  I mean, it is a fact, ladies and gentlemen, that's the nervous system, like when you're poisoned.
[02:34:44.876 --> 02:34:50.218]  Like you take poisonous mushrooms, you start jumping around, same deal, when you've been poisoned.
[02:34:51.977 --> 02:34:55.499]  And the point is, is that if people want to do all this, that's their issue.
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:34:59.142]  But the cancer rates, the neurological rates, they're all off the charts.
[02:34:59.162 --> 02:35:02.404]  So I hope you go to foodbabe.com and sign her petition.
[02:35:03.865 --> 02:35:08.708]  Because if we leverage things enough, we can get all the big manufacturers moving to organic.
[02:35:09.565 --> 02:35:12.266]  And they try to game that as well, but still we're moving in the right direction.
[02:35:12.806 --> 02:35:15.328]  If we can defeat them here, we defeat them worldwide.
[02:35:15.708 --> 02:35:17.549]  They're doubling down with their money in Congress.
[02:35:18.549 --> 02:35:22.951]  They are going after their critics, but they can't intimidate folks anymore.
[02:35:24.658 --> 02:35:27.840]  I mean, 15 years ago, you talked about Monsanto with a published study, they'd come after you.
[02:35:28.380 --> 02:35:30.521]  But people didn't get intimidated, so more spoke out.
[02:35:30.981 --> 02:35:32.322]  Their own scientists have spoken out.
[02:35:32.782 --> 02:35:39.685]  It came out more than a decade ago that Monsanto doesn't even have unorganic food in their cafeterias for their scientists.
[02:35:40.425 --> 02:35:47.588]  That the British elites and the German elites and the French elites and the Chinese communist elites have their own gardens, their own food.
[02:35:48.068 --> 02:35:51.570]  Rich people, establishment insiders, don't drink fluoridated water.
[02:35:52.370 --> 02:35:53.371]  They don't do any of this.
[02:35:54.465 --> 02:35:57.249]  So I hope you get her book.
[02:35:57.510 --> 02:36:01.957]  I hope you get into health like I've tried to do because I've known all this info.
[02:36:01.977 --> 02:36:02.758]  Why not follow it?
[02:36:03.843 --> 02:36:05.264]  Why not actually try to change my life?
[02:36:05.284 --> 02:36:06.285]  Why not try to help my kids?
[02:36:06.565 --> 02:36:09.387]  Doesn't mean you're perfect, but we're being bombarded.
[02:36:09.427 --> 02:36:11.048]  This is the tip of the spear for the globalists.
[02:36:11.088 --> 02:36:14.390]  Briefly, why do I take Survival Shield X2?
[02:36:14.750 --> 02:36:16.971]  It's deep earth, purest iodine you can find.
[02:36:17.352 --> 02:36:19.973]  It's not the bound type, the poison stuff at the store.
[02:36:19.993 --> 02:36:22.675]  It's not like the rad pills you take in an emergency.
[02:36:23.055 --> 02:36:24.556]  This is true purified iodine.
[02:36:24.576 --> 02:36:30.400]  That's the good halogen that blocks the bad fluoride, blocks the other bad halogens, and basically pulls them out of the body.
[02:36:31.621 --> 02:36:37.706]  And believe me, you go on this for a month, you will detox and you will have stuff come out of your skin and your body you won't believe.
[02:36:38.426 --> 02:36:40.107]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:36:40.448 --> 02:36:41.628]  Try it for yourself.
[02:36:41.688 --> 02:36:42.729]  Consult your physician.
[02:36:43.109 --> 02:36:44.050]  This is not a game.
[02:36:45.351 --> 02:36:52.356]  The oxy powder will flush out your upper and lower intestine and just does wonders for everyone I know that's taking it and myself.
[02:36:53.357 --> 02:36:54.098]  You want to get over?
[02:36:55.202 --> 02:36:57.165]  Those, a lot of those bowel problems a lot of people have out there.
[02:36:57.185 --> 02:36:58.626]  I'm not going to go into details.
[02:36:58.947 --> 02:36:59.628]  Give it a try.
[02:36:59.708 --> 02:37:00.589]  You've heard the right reviews.
[02:37:00.849 --> 02:37:01.550]  This isn't a game.
[02:37:01.971 --> 02:37:11.202]  There are real solutions out there and the great part is we're bringing you these high quality products at InfoWarsLive.com and it helps fund our entire operation as well.
[02:37:11.863 --> 02:37:18.268]  So we can have a platform for all these other great activists and people to take action, so we can all interface together and work together.
[02:37:18.608 --> 02:37:21.410]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:21.430 --> 02:37:26.033]  Foodbabe.com is the website, Vani Hari is the foodbabe.
[02:37:26.313 --> 02:37:33.839]  You've got the floor for the next 6-7 minutes to cover other areas, things you haven't gotten into, other important news that's breaking, and tell us about your book.
[02:37:34.602 --> 02:37:35.323]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:37:35.363 --> 02:37:39.987]  So, one of the things you mentioned, Alex, is that a lot of these chemicals in our food are toxins.
[02:37:40.027 --> 02:37:44.871]  They're going to cause health issues, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, kidney failure.
[02:37:45.172 --> 02:37:51.017]  You know, one of the ingredients, and I know you talk about this a lot, is artificial sweeteners.
[02:37:51.257 --> 02:37:51.397]  Yeah.
[02:38:09.438 --> 02:38:12.079]  Artificial sweetener, sucralose, a.k.a.
[02:38:12.159 --> 02:38:19.441]  Splenda, that's now linked to leukemia, that caused the Center of Science and Public Interest to deem it as an unsafe ingredient in our food.
[02:38:20.041 --> 02:38:23.022]  And, you know, that's not something you want to be giving to your kids.
[02:38:23.462 --> 02:38:26.583]  Along those same lines, Pop-Tarts, so popular.
[02:38:26.663 --> 02:38:27.763]  Big Kellogg's products.
[02:38:27.823 --> 02:38:29.504]  It's still being sold everywhere.
[02:38:29.924 --> 02:38:31.485]  It has TBHQ.
[02:38:31.765 --> 02:38:33.606]  TBHQ is a derivative of butane.
[02:38:33.646 --> 02:38:41.791]  This is the ingredient that lobbied Chick-fil-A to remove from their food, which they did, because they did see that consumers didn't want it in their food anymore.
[02:38:42.292 --> 02:38:47.995]  And that ingredient also can be found in these other products over here, but this one also is very alarming.
[02:38:48.035 --> 02:38:51.097]  This is a weight control oatmeal from Quaker Oats.
[02:38:51.137 --> 02:38:53.239]  You'd think this would be really healthy, but it's not.
[02:38:53.259 --> 02:38:53.719]  It actually has
[02:38:54.179 --> 02:38:59.345]  Artificial food dyes and also has that sucralose ingredient that's linked to leukemia.
[02:38:59.385 --> 02:39:05.712]  This is not oatmeal we want to be consuming as America, as a society, to lose weight.
[02:39:05.793 --> 02:39:07.535]  And this brings me to my last point.
[02:39:08.055 --> 02:39:13.642]  All of these chemicals we talked about today, the pesticides, the artificial food dyes, all of the different
[02:39:14.122 --> 02:39:23.748]  Chemical concoctions we're putting in our bodies are creating what we call obesogens in our body, and that is making us fat, sick, unhealthy, and depressed.
[02:39:23.828 --> 02:39:26.670]  And that is why I wrote The Food Babe Way.
[02:39:26.690 --> 02:39:33.995]  The Food Babe Way will teach you everything you need to know about these obesogens, where they are, how to avoid them,
[02:39:34.275 --> 02:39:45.221]  How to avoid the sickening 15 ingredients, how to eat in any restaurant in America and avoid these ingredients, and also what's in the food that are very, very popular health restaurants.
[02:39:45.281 --> 02:39:52.485]  I went undercover to find this information out and put it in my book so that I could bring it to you guys and you could have it all in this...
[02:39:52.785 --> 02:39:53.886]  Beautiful little package.
[02:39:53.906 --> 02:40:02.013]  Here's the brand new hardcover that just came in and this is going to give you the steps on how to break free in this over-processed world.
[02:40:02.313 --> 02:40:06.697]  I'll take you through 21 days and all I want you to do is one habit a day.
[02:40:06.737 --> 02:40:07.718]  It's very doable.
[02:40:08.198 --> 02:40:12.142]  One habit a day, you're going to realize that you know what?
[02:40:12.282 --> 02:40:14.324]  You can maintain your weight without dieting.
[02:40:14.384 --> 02:40:15.826]  You can look younger.
[02:40:15.906 --> 02:40:17.167]  You can feel healthy.
[02:40:17.207 --> 02:40:21.852]  You can hopefully get off your prescription medications because that's what happened to me.
[02:40:22.312 --> 02:40:29.059]  I was on six to eight prescription drugs depending upon the season and now I'm on zero and I feel and look ten times better.
[02:40:29.159 --> 02:40:31.301]  I cannot tell you what a big difference
[02:40:31.581 --> 02:40:36.684]  Learning these habits and then putting them in my life has made, it's created the food babe.
[02:40:36.744 --> 02:40:38.526]  I was not the food babe back in the day.
[02:40:38.546 --> 02:40:39.947]  I look nothing like a babe.
[02:40:39.987 --> 02:40:41.307]  I can tell you that right now.
[02:40:41.988 --> 02:40:48.012]  And this is a true testament to what eating healthy and eliminating the toxic chemicals can do.
[02:40:48.332 --> 02:40:50.013]  And I hope everybody checks out this book.
[02:40:50.053 --> 02:40:51.314]  It's coming out February 10th.
[02:40:51.334 --> 02:40:55.517]  But if you order now, we're giving some ridiculous bonuses whether you pre-order on it

[02:41:19.201 --> 02:41:20.302]  Oh, can I say that on here?
[02:41:20.322 --> 02:41:21.182]  I'm sorry, my butt.
[02:41:22.823 --> 02:41:28.707]  And really get in shape and be in my tip-top shape, and we're giving that away for free, along with tons of other products.
[02:41:28.767 --> 02:41:32.129]  Organic mattresses that aren't filled with toxic materials.
[02:41:32.430 --> 02:41:36.913]  We have organic clay pots that are slow cookers that allow you to cook while you're busy.
[02:41:37.193 --> 02:41:43.238]  You know, all of these healthy tools to get you on your way in 2015 to realize the healthiest you.
[02:41:44.318 --> 02:41:48.882]  Well, we've all got to do it, and none of us are perfect, but we just change our lifestyles.
[02:41:49.302 --> 02:41:50.143]  You talk about how
[02:41:51.837 --> 02:41:59.012]  Going back years ago, you were just in horrible shape and now you look younger, feel better just by getting off the fast food.
[02:41:59.332 --> 02:42:00.315]  Briefly recap that.
[02:42:00.987 --> 02:42:01.788]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:42:01.808 --> 02:42:05.872]  You know, for most of my life, Alex, I grew up on industrial processed food.
[02:42:06.153 --> 02:42:07.314]  I ate the fast food.
[02:42:07.394 --> 02:42:08.735]  My parents were both from India.
[02:42:08.776 --> 02:42:10.197]  They didn't know how to cook American.
[02:42:10.257 --> 02:42:12.460]  They wanted us to fit in with everybody else.
[02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:13.941]  So they let us eat the Burger King.
[02:42:14.001 --> 02:42:16.124]  I had my birthday party at Burger King.
[02:42:16.164 --> 02:42:21.890]  We went to McDonald's and we filled out those little colorings and got the free breakfast for Father's Day and Mother's Day.
[02:42:22.250 --> 02:42:27.672]  We lived our life, my aunt worked at McDonald's and we would go and visit her while I was little.
[02:42:27.772 --> 02:42:29.213]  And I tell you, I ate fast food.
[02:42:29.253 --> 02:42:33.695]  I didn't eat much, anything really truly healthy until much later in my life.
[02:42:33.735 --> 02:42:37.616]  And as a result, I lived a very zombie-like lifestyle.
[02:42:37.656 --> 02:42:38.757]  I never felt well.
[02:42:38.777 --> 02:42:40.097]  I had stomach issues.
[02:42:40.537 --> 02:42:41.978]  I always had like a cloudy...
[02:42:42.718 --> 02:42:46.261]  You know, I was smart because I think I had good genes from two amazing parents.
[02:42:46.341 --> 02:42:49.563]  But I tell you, I really did not feel well.
[02:42:49.603 --> 02:42:50.384]  I didn't look well.
[02:42:50.404 --> 02:42:51.865]  I had eczema all over my face.
[02:42:51.925 --> 02:42:52.745]  I had asthma.
[02:42:52.805 --> 02:42:59.410]  And then in my early 20s, I had a horrible appendicitis episode where I almost didn't get treated for it.
[02:42:59.450 --> 02:43:03.093]  And if it hadn't been for my parents' sixth sense to tell me to go see another doctor,
[02:43:03.573 --> 02:43:13.200]  I might have died because that appendix was about to explode in my body and I had to get it taken out immediately the next morning after visiting an emergency room doctor that told me that nothing was wrong.
[02:43:13.300 --> 02:43:15.682]  So it was a really life-changing moment.
[02:43:16.042 --> 02:43:21.386]  And then even a year after that, something I don't talk about often, Alex, is that, you know, I had endometriosis.
[02:43:21.426 --> 02:43:25.629]  So I've been in and out of the medical system my whole entire life.
[02:43:25.769 --> 02:43:27.891]  And at that moment, I just decided, you know what?
[02:43:28.351 --> 02:43:29.812]  This is not how I want to live.
[02:43:29.912 --> 02:43:30.912]  I'm in my early 20s.
[02:43:30.992 --> 02:43:31.772]  I look horrible.
[02:43:31.832 --> 02:43:32.633]  I feel horrible.
[02:43:33.053 --> 02:43:53.521]  I want to take back control of my health, and so I started using my research skills that I learned in debate in high school, where I was a top-tiered ranked debater, and I started reading books at the library, started looking through the microfiche, and looking through journals, and reading the best books on nutrition, and teaching myself how to eat nutritionally, and what I found out about the food industry
[02:43:54.301 --> 02:43:57.902]  In my search for that has never left me the same.
[02:43:58.082 --> 02:44:03.523]  And so that's why I've made it my mission in life to tell people about what's in their food.
[02:44:04.984 --> 02:44:05.904]  Very well said.
[02:44:05.924 --> 02:44:13.226]  I really am trying to adopt this for myself because children fall after their parents example.
[02:44:13.946 --> 02:44:15.466]  And I've seen dramatic changes.
[02:44:16.246 --> 02:44:18.307]  But the younger you start, the easier it is.
[02:44:18.347 --> 02:44:19.487]  But it's so simple, folks.
[02:44:20.588 --> 02:44:22.268]  When you're on these toxic foods,
[02:44:23.629 --> 02:44:33.493]  These companies in the last hundred years figured out that they could take petrochemicals, basically make drugs, call them additives, that they would then be very addictive.
[02:44:33.533 --> 02:44:35.134]  Most poisons are addictive.
[02:44:36.054 --> 02:44:45.818]  And then people would be branded to the weird additives that were in particular food, just like cigarettes have hundreds of additives in them.
[02:44:46.538 --> 02:44:52.421]  And really, the scientists were there to figure out how to make it more addictive and how to make you smoke more.
[02:44:53.206 --> 02:44:55.447]  And they were able to put incredible poisons in there.
[02:44:56.487 --> 02:44:57.707]  Well, it's the same thing with food.
[02:44:57.787 --> 02:44:58.927]  This is weaponized.
[02:44:59.768 --> 02:45:02.648]  And this stuff all got invented in Germany, England, and the U.S.
[02:45:02.989 --> 02:45:03.989]  in the last hundred years.
[02:45:04.949 --> 02:45:06.910]  And now we're trying to make it out of it.
[02:45:06.950 --> 02:45:13.831]  But you can look at all the numbers, all the neurological disorders, the cancer, people's skin, everything.
[02:45:13.871 --> 02:45:19.793]  And then they put fluoride in the water, sodium fluoride, hydrofluorosilic acid, which
[02:45:21.227 --> 02:45:23.591]  Harvard admits lowers IQ and gives you cancer.
[02:45:24.252 --> 02:45:31.161]  Pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, seven-fold increase in bone cancer in men.
[02:45:32.563 --> 02:45:35.307]  Major thyroid problems in women.
[02:45:36.206 --> 02:45:43.589]  That's why women, that most scientists believe, have off-the-chart thyroid problems, is that it fills the thyroid and the women can't even get iodine.
[02:45:44.589 --> 02:45:45.529]  So this is a plan.
[02:45:46.290 --> 02:45:52.992]  And I know, Food Babe, you like to stick with what you can prove, but if you get into the eugenics and the secret programs, a lot of this is now public.
[02:45:54.092 --> 02:45:59.614]  The fact that government in America lets companies do this, but other governments won't.
[02:46:00.675 --> 02:46:03.616]  You know, Japan and India banned Gardasil when it starts killing women.
[02:46:03.876 --> 02:46:04.276]  We don't.
[02:46:05.222 --> 02:46:06.804]  Foreign countries ban fluoride.
[02:46:06.864 --> 02:46:07.364]  We won't.
[02:46:09.026 --> 02:46:12.590]  I mean, what is it about America in closing that you think all this is allowed?
[02:46:13.916 --> 02:46:15.557]  It's about the bottom line, Alex.
[02:46:15.937 --> 02:46:16.958]  It's America, baby.
[02:46:17.198 --> 02:46:18.478]  It's about the bottom line.
[02:46:18.819 --> 02:46:24.662]  And I'll tell you, you know, it is so sad that our government cannot regulate our food anymore.
[02:46:24.702 --> 02:46:33.807]  The fact that Michael Taylor admitted, the deputy commissioner of the FDA admitted that he doesn't have the know-how to know how many chemicals we're being exposed to or even regulate them.
[02:46:33.847 --> 02:46:39.730]  The fact that food companies themselves can approve their own ingredients generally regarded as safe.
[02:46:40.330 --> 02:46:49.757]  I mean, the food companies themselves doing self-regulation, the companies that are set to profit on these chemicals making their food less expensive for them.
[02:46:50.377 --> 02:46:51.518]  That has got to stop.
[02:46:51.598 --> 02:47:00.604]  And that's why it's absolutely important for us Americans to find out what's in our food, understand it, and say no to it if there's health issues associated with it.
[02:47:00.624 --> 02:47:04.707]  You know, this food that we've been eating for the last 30 years is all new.
[02:47:04.787 --> 02:47:06.489]  It's invented food.
[02:47:06.509 --> 02:47:07.609]  It did not exist.
[02:47:08.638 --> 02:47:09.579]  Several years ago.
[02:47:09.599 --> 02:47:13.123]  And this is a massive experiment on our bodies.
[02:47:13.403 --> 02:47:19.950]  And I know when I decided to opt out of that experience and that experiment, my body changed for the better.
[02:47:20.050 --> 02:47:24.115]  And I can't sit back and let people walk around like zombies like I used to.
[02:47:24.135 --> 02:47:26.257]  I have to tell people what's going on.
[02:47:26.357 --> 02:47:41.271]  That's right, we are battling the zombie apocalypse and we are reaching out to people that laugh at us and that stare up from their pot mark faces with their glazed eyes with, you know, yellow in them from all the liver damage and giggle at us.
[02:47:41.671 --> 02:47:42.972]  They've been pre-programmed to do it.
[02:47:43.012 --> 02:47:44.273]  That's all they know how to do.
[02:47:44.874 --> 02:47:45.274]  It's a...
[02:47:46.405 --> 02:47:50.366]  Defense mechanism, because deep down they feel so powerless and so pathetic.
[02:47:50.666 --> 02:47:51.867]  They just act secure.
[02:47:52.387 --> 02:47:53.547]  They act like they're powerful.
[02:47:53.587 --> 02:47:56.148]  They act like they, you know, know what they're doing and laugh at us.
[02:47:56.588 --> 02:48:00.970]  You got to get through that first layer of defense and reach out to these poor people.
[02:48:01.710 --> 02:48:07.814]  That really are modern food concentration camp victims in a giant eugenics operation.
[02:48:08.394 --> 02:48:09.695]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:48:09.735 --> 02:48:11.136]  Foodbabe.com.
[02:48:11.456 --> 02:48:12.757]  Vani Hari, thank you so much.
[02:48:12.997 --> 02:48:14.999]  Look forward to talking to you when the book officially comes out.
[02:48:15.319 --> 02:48:18.541]  And we have it in the shopping cart at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:48:18.581 --> 02:48:19.221]  Thank you so much.
[02:48:19.582 --> 02:48:20.202]  Thank you.
[02:48:21.023 --> 02:48:22.964]  There goes Vani Hari, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:24.285 --> 02:48:26.346]  You know what we just did for the last 40 minutes?
[02:48:26.406 --> 02:48:27.687]  We listened to a woman.
[02:48:29.841 --> 02:48:36.287]  And gee, I was brought up where women knew how to shoot guns, but they also wore dresses because dresses were pretty.
[02:48:36.307 --> 02:48:39.390]  And they put lipstick on because it was pretty.
[02:48:41.673 --> 02:48:43.054]  But where they knew how to change tires.
[02:48:44.715 --> 02:48:52.163]  So I didn't grow up in a family where you just look at men and women and then say,
[02:48:53.373 --> 02:48:54.914]  You know, men do this, women do that.
[02:48:54.994 --> 02:49:01.436]  But at the same time, there are traditional roles that women and men enjoy being in, because that's what we do genetically.
[02:49:03.017 --> 02:49:08.159]  But the system wants to act like the fact that men and women are different, like we're at war with each other.
[02:49:08.439 --> 02:49:09.880]  And that's all part of the balkanization.
[02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:17.503]  And men are arrested development jerks, many of them, and women are self-centered tarts in many cases.
[02:49:18.543 --> 02:49:19.163]  God love them.
[02:49:21.064 --> 02:49:23.005]  But this Pope, you know I'm
[02:49:24.403 --> 02:49:28.165]  Don't get involved in religious stuff, infighting and things.
[02:49:29.986 --> 02:49:32.848]  And I have a lot of Catholic friends and they've done a lot of great work for pro-life.
[02:49:34.989 --> 02:49:37.850]  This new Pope is basically the opposite of the last one.
[02:49:38.210 --> 02:49:40.212]  So one of them's right, one of them's wrong, right?
[02:49:40.252 --> 02:49:42.093]  For the faithful out there who are Catholics.
[02:49:43.293 --> 02:49:45.835]  This guy sounds like Barack Obama.
[02:49:48.356 --> 02:49:53.759]  He's anti-gun, he's come out for a UN gun treaty, he wants carbon taxes, global government.
[02:49:55.575 --> 02:49:58.178]  He's come out and said God hates when we hurt the earth?
[02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:04.484]  Just, I mean, could you come out against Monsanto like Chuck Norris did?
[02:50:04.984 --> 02:50:06.546]  How about God said don't mix the seed?
[02:50:06.566 --> 02:50:07.367]  Genetic engineering.
[02:50:08.988 --> 02:50:13.933]  How about you come out against PepsiCo using fetal tissue for their flavor testing?
[02:50:14.954 --> 02:50:16.015]  Oh no, we're not going to hear that.
[02:50:16.035 --> 02:50:18.138]  We're going to hear just these vague things.
[02:50:18.178 --> 02:50:19.279]  But listen, it gets better.
[02:50:20.475 --> 02:50:23.617]  The Pope has now come out and said, listen to women more.
[02:50:24.117 --> 02:50:25.538]  Don't be macho.
[02:50:25.958 --> 02:50:27.059]  Pope tells men.
[02:50:28.380 --> 02:50:28.940]  Wonderful.
[02:50:30.481 --> 02:50:32.923]  Well, let me give men a little newsflash, if you actually believe this.
[02:50:33.943 --> 02:50:38.426]  Women want, not guys that are fake macho, but men that are men and aren't going to be pushed around.
[02:50:39.491 --> 02:50:44.556]  Women don't like men they can push around all day, so go ahead and take the Pope's advice, because men have already stopped being men.
[02:50:45.077 --> 02:50:49.682]  See, the government's run by a bunch of corrupt men, and they don't want men to stand up against them.
[02:50:49.842 --> 02:50:55.748]  They want to roll in and take over the families, and take over the women, and take the women's babies and use them for Pepsi flavoring.
[02:50:56.909 --> 02:50:57.650]  So, you know what?
[02:50:58.090 --> 02:51:01.494]  Pope, you just go ahead and put your advice out, I'll put mine out.
[02:51:01.774 --> 02:51:02.475]  How's that sound?
[02:51:03.573 --> 02:51:04.854]  Hey, sorry I'm running late.
[02:51:04.974 --> 02:51:06.835]  I had to stop and get my vitamins for the month.
[02:51:07.136 --> 02:51:10.258]  I got mine in the mail yesterday from DiscountNutritionShop.com.
[02:51:10.438 --> 02:51:11.859]  So I'm here, totally on time.

[02:51:33.808 --> 02:51:34.569]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:51:34.809 --> 02:51:38.151]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:51:38.251 --> 02:51:39.832]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[02:51:39.932 --> 02:51:41.673]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:51:41.874 --> 02:51:47.377]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:51:47.717 --> 02:51:48.458]  I know, right?
[02:51:48.558 --> 02:51:49.498]  You love it, too!
[02:51:49.859 --> 02:51:51.159]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[02:51:51.300 --> 02:51:52.200]  Let's go get some!

[02:52:07.168 --> 02:52:09.068]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[02:52:09.148 --> 02:52:11.829]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.

[02:54:03.965 --> 02:54:06.146]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:54:06.726 --> 02:54:09.507]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:17.443 --> 02:54:24.426]  My point about listening to a woman is the condescension of men listen to women.
[02:54:27.688 --> 02:54:34.010]  Well, if a woman's got something good to say that makes sense, it's taking action and leading a fight, I'll listen, I'll get behind them.
[02:54:34.811 --> 02:54:35.751]  I'll get behind a man.
[02:54:37.412 --> 02:54:42.054]  I get behind ideas, like Martin Luther King said, what people stand for, the character.
[02:54:44.309 --> 02:54:49.353]  But it's always, listen because they're a woman, or support Obamacare for black people.
[02:54:50.214 --> 02:54:51.315]  When it's a big screw job.
[02:54:52.476 --> 02:54:53.336]  It's the dumbing down.
[02:54:54.117 --> 02:54:56.459]  It's the condescension.
[02:54:56.879 --> 02:54:58.560]  Listen to women more.
[02:54:59.381 --> 02:55:00.942]  Don't be bad to the earth.
[02:55:01.022 --> 02:55:04.505]  Pay carbon taxes, my children.
[02:55:07.988 --> 02:55:09.029]  Don't be macho.
[02:55:10.376 --> 02:55:11.957]  I don't know, men are already pretty castrated.
[02:55:12.218 --> 02:55:15.500]  How about the Pope calls for men to just have their huevos chopped off?
[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:16.021]  How about that?
[02:55:17.582 --> 02:55:25.689]  The Catholic Church can put on a free surgery on top of all the illegals they're pumping into the country and just, you know, that's the end of it.
[02:55:28.071 --> 02:55:36.198]  I mean, that's all I'm saying is that we got two years of Barack Obama now.
[02:55:36.772 --> 02:55:40.893]  But it seems like we got like 10 years or whatever of Barack Senior here.
[02:55:42.574 --> 02:55:43.694]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[02:55:43.734 --> 02:55:46.235]  Is the Pope really Obama's father since we don't know who?
[02:55:46.255 --> 02:55:51.957]  I was about to make a really bad joke and I'm not going to do it.
[02:55:53.658 --> 02:55:54.878]  I'm just getting tired of it.
[02:55:55.118 --> 02:55:56.098]  I'm getting tired of it.
[02:55:56.879 --> 02:56:01.140]  And let me tell you, what's coming next here?
[02:56:03.154 --> 02:56:07.156]  Because we can barely hold back the globalists right now and their total global takeover.
[02:56:07.756 --> 02:56:14.379]  If 1.2 billion Catholics start supporting carbon taxes and gun control and open borders, we're done.
[02:56:17.100 --> 02:56:22.063]  I don't know, maybe I should just join with the Pope.
[02:56:22.663 --> 02:56:28.846]  That's right, listen to women and carbon, pay Al Gore money and turn your guns in.
[02:56:30.285 --> 02:56:33.387]  But of course, the Pope's not going to have his secret police turn their guns in.
[02:56:33.847 --> 02:56:36.449]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:56:38.810 --> 02:56:44.034]  What is good for the pontiff is not good when he's pontificating.
[02:56:45.115 --> 02:56:46.275]  He pontificates to us.
[02:56:49.718 --> 02:56:52.659]  So, do as he says, not as he does.
[02:56:56.062 --> 02:56:57.843]  I don't want to really end the transmission with this.
[02:56:57.883 --> 02:56:59.584]  It just makes me want to throw up sometimes.
[02:57:01.869 --> 02:57:02.670]  Look at this headline.
[02:57:02.730 --> 02:57:08.014]  School says students throw away 85% of vegetables served in healthy lunches.
[02:57:09.675 --> 02:57:11.576]  Maybe that's because they taste absolutely terrible.
[02:57:13.918 --> 02:57:17.201]  You know, it really is just our decadence at the end of the day that's causing all of this.
[02:57:21.204 --> 02:57:29.410]  I just know a lot of positive things are happening at the same time, so as negative as a lot of things can get, a lot of really great things are happening at the same time.
[02:57:29.430 --> 02:57:30.471]  There is a big awakening.
[02:57:32.090 --> 02:57:35.652]  When we vote with our dollars, like with organic food, we can change the world.
[02:57:35.692 --> 02:57:39.535]  We vote with our dollars supporting candidates that are supporting freedom.
[02:57:40.376 --> 02:57:53.485]  And when we vote with our mouths saying no to garbage, and not being cult followers of any president, or any prime minister, or any pop star, or any religious leader,
[02:57:55.247 --> 02:58:02.870]  When we actually follow what Jesus Christ had to say, do unto others as you have done unto you, that's when things will really start changing.
[02:58:04.191 --> 02:58:05.812]  And I'm not up here on some high horse.
[02:58:06.832 --> 02:58:10.654]  I'm not up here speaking to somebody that's got all the answers or is perfect.
[02:58:11.734 --> 02:58:22.259]  I just know corruption has set in and as a culture, as a society, little people need to get involved and take action because little people are the solution.
[02:58:22.279 --> 02:58:24.680]  And when they move, nothing on earth can stop them.
[02:58:25.925 --> 02:58:30.847]  And if the establishment's pushing something, you better believe it's bad news.
[02:58:32.727 --> 02:58:35.288]  All right, that's it for this worldwide transmission.
[02:58:35.748 --> 02:58:37.609]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:58:37.629 --> 02:58:41.610]  We'll have expanded coverage tomorrow night on the Nightly News of the State of the Union.
[02:58:41.630 --> 02:58:50.033]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:53.502 --> 02:58:54.723]  Another major health threat.
[02:58:54.743 --> 02:58:59.645]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:58:59.725 --> 02:59:02.346]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:59:02.406 --> 02:59:09.168]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:59:09.449 --> 02:59:12.310]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:59:12.430 --> 02:59:15.391]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:59:15.471 --> 02:59:17.372]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:59:17.412 --> 02:59:20.233]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:59:20.333 --> 02:59:25.835]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:59:26.055 --> 02:59:29.537]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:59:29.557 --> 02:59:32.558]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
