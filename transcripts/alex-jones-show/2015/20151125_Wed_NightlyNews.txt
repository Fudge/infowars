[00:00:19.588 --> 00:00:21.671]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.053]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.073 --> 00:00:25.216]  It is November 25th, 2015, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.706]  There's always been the idea that Turkey was supporting ISIS in some way.
[00:00:36.906 --> 00:00:41.390]  We know they funneled people going through Turkey to ISIS.
[00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:44.373]  Someone's buying that oil that ISIS is selling.
[00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:45.555]  It's going through somewhere.
[00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:54.183]  Former NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, General Wesley Clark, says Turkey is indeed supporting ISIS.
[00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:59.967]  Meanwhile, Senator John McCain celebrates the latest developments in Syria.
[00:00:59.987 --> 00:01:05.611]  I might do what we did in Afghanistan many years ago to give those guys the ability to shoot down those planes.
[00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:08.073]  That equipment is available.
[00:01:09.932 --> 00:01:16.778]  Plus, Michael Moore tells the governor of Michigan that he's ready to take home Syrian refugees.
[00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:18.900]  Well, let's send them these guys.
[00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:20.382]  What do you say there, Michael?
[00:01:20.742 --> 00:01:24.686]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.571]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:01:31.872 --> 00:01:33.173]  You can't survive without it.
[00:01:33.353 --> 00:01:34.275]  But where do you get it?
[00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:40.321]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:46.288]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:01:46.468 --> 00:02:03.329]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.009]  We're good to go.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.963]  After Turkey shot down a Russian jet, all eyes are on the area.
[00:02:37.283 --> 00:02:42.146]  And now we have a former NATO general saying that Turkey is actually in support of ISIS.
[00:02:42.646 --> 00:02:49.851]  All along, there's always been the idea that Turkey was supporting ISIS in some way.
[00:02:50.051 --> 00:02:54.514]  We know they've funneled people going through Turkey to ISIS.
[00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.516]  Someone's buying that oil that ISIS is selling.
[00:02:57.576 --> 00:02:58.697]  It's going through somewhere.
[00:02:59.838 --> 00:03:02.580]  It looks to me like it's probably going through Turkey.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:14.723]  And that was former NATO Supreme Allied Commander General Wesley Clark as he responded to yesterday's shoot down of a Russian fighter jet by pointing out that Turkey is in support of ISIS.
[00:03:15.043 --> 00:03:17.544]  But that's not to say that he is in support of Russia either.
[00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:21.705]  If you watch that full clip he has some very harsh things to say about them as well.
[00:03:22.165 --> 00:03:30.948]  But as we talk about Turkey's involvement with ISIS, you know, it was earlier this year we had the flashback article about a Turkey Prime Minister who was caught arming ISIS.
[00:03:31.108 --> 00:03:39.510]  And some people saying, hey, this is just one rogue guy, you know, his actions have no reflection on the Turkish military or Turkish government in general.
[00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.511]  And people said, okay, maybe that is true.
[00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:49.213]  But now that we have a NATO, a former NATO commander coming out and saying these things, people are starting to wonder if Turkey does have a larger involvement.
[00:03:49.833 --> 00:04:00.498]  And the article says, Turkish Prime Minister was caught shipping arms to ISIS in January, which may explain why the NATO ally shot down a Russian jet targeting ISIS militants on Tuesday.
[00:04:00.538 --> 00:04:05.120]  And as we stressed, we don't know 100% for sure what their motivation was.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.902]  We're going to talk to David Knight more about that in our coming segments.
[00:04:09.422 --> 00:04:14.805]  But as we talk about not just things that are going on foreignly, but we talk about things that are going on domestically.
[00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:19.670]  And the terror alert in general, because we've seen, of course, the recent attacks in Paris.
[00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.435]  We've seen the attacks earlier in places like Dallas, you know, going on all over the world.
[00:04:25.076 --> 00:04:33.206]  And now we have social media reacting to the State Department's declaration that pretty much the whole world is under a travel advisory.
[00:04:34.147 --> 00:04:40.873]  And just in case you didn't know, the State Department issued a worldwide travel warning for Americans just in time for the holidays.
[00:04:41.293 --> 00:04:44.155]  And this goes all the way through February 24th.
[00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:47.638]  So it goes through Thanksgiving, through Christmas, through New Year's.
[00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:53.984]  So if you're pretty much any place on planet Earth, they want you to be shaking in your boots, afraid of an imminent attack.
[00:04:54.404 --> 00:04:58.307]  Now we'll take a look at some of these tweets here of people voicing their opinions about this.
[00:04:59.228 --> 00:05:00.991]  One person said... Another said...
[00:05:10.865 --> 00:05:14.787]  Does this advisory apply to golf courses in and around the United States?
[00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:16.528]  I'm pretty sure those would be pretty safe.
[00:05:16.928 --> 00:05:21.091]  Now, so the president is having a bit of trouble containing this J team.
[00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:31.037]  As you guys may recall, Obama had previously stated that ISIS was the JV team and they have been growing in strength somewhat thanks to our
[00:05:31.917 --> 00:05:42.928]  Politicians, I don't want to say the government or military in general, but certain politicians continuing to fund these guys, not just ISIS, Al Qaeda, you know, different organizations doing different things.
[00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:44.310]  And that's always what it is.
[00:05:45.438 --> 00:05:47.079]  Which so many people don't understand.
[00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:55.762]  They get, I guess, upset now because the TV tells them to get upset and jump up and come to the defense of the Syrian rebels, or should I say the Syrian refugees.
[00:05:56.062 --> 00:06:04.526]  And definitely my heart goes out to these people, but my heart goes out to them because we have an administration that's continuing to fund people who are making that region worse.
[00:06:04.806 --> 00:06:14.370]  They're funding Al-Qaeda, they're airdropping grenades to ISIS, and then after they use our tax money to go over there and tear up their country, they say, use more of your tax money to bring them here.
[00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.132]  Meanwhile, Obama's not offering up his penthouse in Chicago.
[00:06:18.192 --> 00:06:20.293]  He's not housing people in the White House.
[00:06:20.593 --> 00:06:28.096]  You know, when they go tear up Iraq, the Bush family isn't putting people on their private residence, but they want you, the American taxpayer, to fund all this stuff.
[00:06:28.316 --> 00:06:29.337]  And like I said, I have...
[00:06:30.257 --> 00:06:35.480]  I do support a open borders policy as long as they pass the background checks, whatever that may be.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:46.728]  I'm not exactly how deep that process goes, but we have seen the top advisors saying that, Mr. President, we can't vet 10,000 people at a time and the Obama administration say, screw that, bring them all here.
[00:06:46.748 --> 00:06:49.469]  I don't know if it's guilty conscious or what exactly it is.
[00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:56.314]  You know, like I said, I do feel for the people, but it's really the top administration who should be taking care of this problem, not the American taxpayer.
[00:06:57.341 --> 00:07:06.587]  And now let's talk about this continued threat and the FBI is saying be aware of copycat killers, copycat attacks like we've seen in places like Paris.
[00:07:07.108 --> 00:07:10.270]  But Obama has said there is no credible plot against the homeland.
[00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:25.520]  The FBI sent a bulletin earlier this week to police departments across the country warning of possible copycat incidents and sharing intelligence on how the assailants in Paris carried out the attacks this past or I guess a couple weeks ago that killed 130 people.
[00:07:27.641 --> 00:07:30.342]  So they want you to be sober, vigilant, and all these things.
[00:07:30.382 --> 00:07:32.603]  And of course, you do want to be safe around the holidays.
[00:07:32.923 --> 00:07:38.646]  Yes, terrorists do like to target places like movie theaters or sporting events, malls, places like that.
[00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:39.626]  It's not always ISIS.
[00:07:39.646 --> 00:07:41.767]  It can be some domestic guy as well.
[00:07:42.047 --> 00:07:44.288]  But it doesn't mean that you shouldn't go out and enjoy life.
[00:07:44.348 --> 00:07:46.149]  Because after 9-11, we were told what?
[00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:48.090]  These people hate us for our freedoms.
[00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:53.053]  And when we sit around shaking in our boots, afraid to go to the football game, then yeah, the terrorists win.
[00:07:53.354 --> 00:07:54.254]  You don't want the terrorists to win.
[00:07:54.334 --> 00:07:57.957]  I also don't want the TSA to fill me up if I go to the Super Bowl.
[00:07:58.217 --> 00:08:00.659]  But that doesn't mean I want to sit around at the house.
[00:08:00.719 --> 00:08:07.424]  So, you know, just try to be as safe as you can this holiday weekend or the holidays in general.
[00:08:07.464 --> 00:08:11.427]  But once again, don't let people win by taking away your freedoms.
[00:08:11.758 --> 00:08:20.924]  Now, as I was speaking earlier about the White House doing all these things that make the rest of the planet worse, meanwhile, they're not housing people that come here seeking refuge.
[00:08:20.964 --> 00:08:27.569]  Just like, you know, after Iran-Contra, you know, Reagan wasn't bringing people into his private ranch who were affected by that.
[00:08:27.609 --> 00:08:31.151]  Same thing with Bush, Obama, you know, any of these other politicians as well.
[00:08:31.551 --> 00:08:36.154]  And now Michael Moore, a guy who I'm not a fan of at all, but you know, he made a decent statement here.
[00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:41.018]  He said, Hey, I will house people who are refugees from Syria.
[00:08:41.918 --> 00:08:53.028]  Now, this is in wake of many governors, politicians talking about how they don't have a desire or a willingness to bring Syrian refugees to the country at this point in time because of terror concerns.
[00:08:55.419 --> 00:08:58.942]  As I stated earlier, the Obama administration has a very large play in this.
[00:08:59.302 --> 00:09:03.005]  But now Michael Moore, a private citizen, is saying, hey, I'll bring people to my house.
[00:09:03.345 --> 00:09:11.312]  And I have no issue with private individuals, churches, other people who volunteer their homes to affected people, not just from Syria.
[00:09:11.372 --> 00:09:13.954]  It could be Pakistan, Yemen, Mexico, wherever.
[00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:18.978]  If private individuals and churches or people of that nature want to open their homes up, that's fine.
[00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:21.460]  My issue is when they try to force that on the American people.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:26.465]  As the circle goes, we all know it goes all the way back up to the White House by the people coming here anyway.
[00:09:26.945 --> 00:09:44.763]  Now, in a letter to Snyder, that is the governor of Michigan, that Moore posted on his Facebook page, the director wrote, I just want to let you know that contrary to your decision to deny Syrian refugees a home in our state of Michigan, I myself am going to defy your ban and will offer my home
[00:09:45.283 --> 00:09:49.065]  In Michigan to those very Syrian refugees you decided to keep out.
[00:09:49.365 --> 00:09:53.788]  He said he would contact the State Department and let them know that he is happy to house people in his home.
[00:09:54.108 --> 00:09:56.709]  I'm very curious to see if he follows up on that.
[00:09:56.829 --> 00:10:02.392]  I'd really like to see a statement from the State Department saying that Michael Moore actually did call them and offer his residence.
[00:10:02.753 --> 00:10:05.114]  If he did, good job you being a humanitarian.
[00:10:05.134 --> 00:10:13.018]  But once again, why don't we start holding the people who are doing these very anti-humanitarian things accountable when they go blow up these foreign countries.
[00:10:13.598 --> 00:10:13.779]  Now,
[00:10:14.659 --> 00:10:16.280]  To talk about things here domestically.
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.301]  If you're in the state of Florida, I guess you're in a pretty good state of mind right now.
[00:10:20.322 --> 00:10:25.824]  Because I guess apparently all the police have caught all the rapists, murderers, child molesters.
[00:10:25.844 --> 00:10:29.445]  You don't have to worry about drunk drivers or anything else going on in your area.
[00:10:29.486 --> 00:10:38.890]  Because the crime rate, in my mind, just from reading this headline, must have gotten so low that the police have nothing else to do but bust old women who are playing Mahjong.
[00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:44.234]  Police bust weekly Mahjong game playing by elderly women.
[00:10:44.794 --> 00:10:49.238]  The group was accused of the crime for women between the ages of 87 and 95.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:11:00.128]  One of the women said word spread about their weekly gathering and a troublemaker in the community called the police citing a law that prohibits playing the game for money.
[00:11:00.508 --> 00:11:01.890]  Police closed the clubhouse.
[00:11:03.393 --> 00:11:08.458]  And it reminds me of that old Seinfeld episode, like, uh, what was the guy named Bookman?
[00:11:08.498 --> 00:11:15.025]  Like this guy went around, uh, tracking down people and arresting them for having books or overdue library books.
[00:11:15.625 --> 00:11:17.507]  And that didn't just happen in a Seinfeld episode.
[00:11:17.527 --> 00:11:18.728]  That actually happened in real life.
[00:11:18.748 --> 00:11:21.531]  They said, Hey man, if you don't show up with this book, you're going to go to jail.
[00:11:21.611 --> 00:11:23.073]  Eventually the guy came in with a book.
[00:11:23.553 --> 00:11:39.045]  But it just goes to show the hierarchy, the state of mind of the police state, when they will just forego all these very serious, very heinous crimes to crack down on the old ladies, probably some widows in there, I'm sure, 87 to 95.
[00:11:39.105 --> 00:11:45.170]  I'm pretty sure some of these ladies are just lonely and just want people to hang out with.
[00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.793]  So they get together, they want to have a Mahjong game, they want to play poker, whatever they want to do.
[00:11:50.814 --> 00:11:52.976]  Smoking cigars and drinking beer and watching the game.
[00:11:53.016 --> 00:11:53.876]  I don't care what they do.
[00:11:54.197 --> 00:11:54.677]  They're old.
[00:11:54.697 --> 00:11:58.200]  They let them do what they want to do, but now the cops want to come down and bust these people.
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.661]  It's just completely ridiculous.
[00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:11.250]  At least they didn't show up with an MRAP and pepper spray them and flashbang them, but man, it is wild how they continue just to crack down people who just do pretty much nothing wrong whatsoever.
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.322]  Now as we're talking about the police, let's talk about police and political correctness.
[00:12:16.342 --> 00:12:20.284]  And we have a sheriff saying that he is politically incorrect and very proud of it.
[00:12:20.744 --> 00:12:23.045]  This is a gentleman in Harris County, Georgia.
[00:12:23.685 --> 00:12:25.846]  And this is Sheriff Mike Jolly.
[00:12:26.527 --> 00:12:30.929]  Paid for by Jolly, the sign reads, Warning, Harris County is politically incorrect.
[00:12:31.049 --> 00:12:34.851]  We say Merry Christmas, God bless America, and in God we trust.
[00:12:35.311 --> 00:12:37.212]  We salute our troops and our flag.
[00:12:37.532 --> 00:12:38.973]  If this offends you, leave.
[00:12:40.073 --> 00:12:45.834]  So there's a man standing up for the right to be politically incorrect because we've all seen the war on Christmas.
[00:12:45.894 --> 00:12:53.076]  I'm not talking about this faux war, you know, taking Santa Claus off coffee cups that has nothing to do with Christianity whatsoever.
[00:12:53.436 --> 00:12:59.818]  But we have seen people telling kids you can't wear crosses in schools, all types of different things, saying you can't have
[00:13:00.518 --> 00:13:08.121]  A Christmas celebration in your town, you have to call it Winter Festival or Christmas Tree Day or whatever type of silly things they do.
[00:13:09.022 --> 00:13:11.943]  Now this man is coming out saying, hey, I'm not going to fall for that.
[00:13:12.143 --> 00:13:18.446]  I'm going to exercise my rights to call Christmas what it is and greet people and say, God bless you and God bless America.
[00:13:18.946 --> 00:13:36.915]  Now, if you say that this sign offends you for whatever reason, you say it's wrong for a person, official spokesman of the government to come out and say all these things and put up the sign saying that he's politically incorrect, I want to direct your attention to a statement made by Governor Cuomo from New York.
[00:13:37.375 --> 00:13:41.258]  And he says that gun-loving pro-lifers are not welcome in New York.
[00:13:41.498 --> 00:13:44.020]  He doesn't want these right-wing extremists.
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:14:03.995]  So while people will jump up and down, I'm sure, about Mr. Jolly in Georgia saying that he was politically incorrect and saying all the things that he said, a lot of people had no issue with Governor Cuomo saying that these extreme conservatives who are right-to-life, pro-assault weapon, and anti-gay, referring to Republicans, they have no place in the state of New York
[00:14:04.335 --> 00:14:07.116]  The governor said, because that's not who New Yorkers are.
[00:14:07.476 --> 00:14:11.777]  He's saying, I'm going to tell you who New Yorkers are, the people who think exactly like me.
[00:14:12.197 --> 00:14:13.557]  And of course, we know that's not the case.
[00:14:13.577 --> 00:14:17.678]  If the governor of Texas jumped up and said that, I'll say, no, I don't agree with everything you say.
[00:14:18.098 --> 00:14:19.838]  And one person actually put out a tweet.
[00:14:20.178 --> 00:14:24.039]  It says, if you want to live in New York, you have to agree with Governor Cuomo.
[00:14:24.539 --> 00:14:27.280]  What an arrogant, undemocratic mindset.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.080]  Yeah, I agree with that 100%.
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.661]  And as he was talking about guys who are anti-gun or, excuse me, pro-gun,
[00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:39.554]  We all know these politicians, especially big governors, guys like that, they have armed bodyguards.
[00:14:39.614 --> 00:14:45.499]  So why can't the people of New York exercise their right to carry a firearm, Mr. Governor?
[00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:49.823]  Also saying people who are pro-life, right to life.
[00:14:50.463 --> 00:14:52.185]  What is possibly wrong with that?
[00:14:52.205 --> 00:14:55.407]  That's what I was talking about yesterday on the Alex Jones Show, doing the overdrive segment.
[00:14:55.768 --> 00:14:56.989]  I mean, all these people, they're
[00:14:57.609 --> 00:15:04.571]  Anti-gun, they're cracking down on drunk driving, which of course I'm not suggesting you go out and drunk drive.
[00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:08.852]  But they want to go out and ban all these things and put sanctions on all these types of activities.
[00:15:09.232 --> 00:15:13.033]  Meanwhile, they would be more than happy to kill a child in the womb.
[00:15:13.093 --> 00:15:19.355]  So it's like once the child is out the womb, we have to ban everything to protect the child and put it in its little safe space like on South Park.
[00:15:19.835 --> 00:15:24.997]  But while it's in the womb, you can punch it, kick it, rip it out, rip its head out.
[00:15:25.137 --> 00:15:25.978]  What'd the guy do?
[00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:26.418]  Kermit?
[00:15:26.778 --> 00:15:28.899]  He was twisting the heads off like a doll.
[00:15:29.479 --> 00:15:33.001]  Also, the lady's saying that they would use the body parts and sell them for Lamborghinis.
[00:15:33.241 --> 00:15:38.924]  You can do all these horrific things to a child if it's in the womb, but as soon as it comes out, then they act like it's an actual person.
[00:15:38.964 --> 00:15:43.226]  No, it's a person even before it's born, even though you try to pretend that it is not.
[00:15:44.744 --> 00:15:50.608]  And when we're talking about people who pretend like things are not Hillary Clinton wants you to think that Benghazi was not a big deal.
[00:15:51.048 --> 00:16:00.735]  I think it pretty much is because they want to tell you that the situation with the ambassador, Ambassador Stevens, was pretty much a miscommunication.
[00:16:00.775 --> 00:16:01.996]  You know, what difference does it make?
[00:16:02.316 --> 00:16:07.059]  So you have a woman who has a private email server who in my mind would make her more accessible to it.
[00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:10.962]  If you have your own thing, you're like, I don't want to use something provided to me by the government.
[00:16:11.002 --> 00:16:14.684]  I have my own thing, which is allowed me to respond to emails or information quicker.
[00:16:14.684 --> 00:16:15.966]  We're good to go.
[00:16:31.468 --> 00:16:31.608]  I don't
[00:16:46.735 --> 00:16:51.979]  Because you guys recall, Rand Paul is like, do you know anything about the armed shipments to Turkey?
[00:16:51.999 --> 00:16:52.680]  And she's like, to Turkey?
[00:17:13.155 --> 00:17:13.775]  Is the U.S.
[00:17:13.835 --> 00:17:23.139]  involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling, anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:26.840]  To Turkey?
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.401]  Stay tuned after this for more special reports.
[00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.971]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[00:17:45.232 --> 00:17:46.693]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[00:17:47.174 --> 00:17:47.394]  Okay?
[00:17:47.694 --> 00:17:50.557]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:17:50.757 --> 00:17:52.458]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:17:52.478 --> 00:17:53.760]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:54.841]  This is Texas.
[00:17:55.061 --> 00:17:55.882]  You wanna threaten me?
[00:17:55.942 --> 00:17:57.063]  You can go straight to hell.
[00:17:57.083 --> 00:17:57.723]  You understand that?
[00:17:57.883 --> 00:18:03.609]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:18:04.089 --> 00:18:07.913]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.246]  Shane Steiner's involvement with InfoWarsLife.com truly happened in an organic way.
[00:18:21.386 --> 00:18:29.995]  I went to high school with Shane, his brother, knew his parents well, and he was visiting the office once, hadn't been to the office in years, and said, wow, I notice you're making and selling supplements.
[00:18:30.015 --> 00:18:30.776]  Do these really work?
[00:18:30.816 --> 00:18:35.862]  Because I've tried a lot of supplements as a workout enthusiast, and I really think most of them are hype.
[00:18:35.902 --> 00:18:37.403]  And I said, here, take some home, try it.
[00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:44.048]  Well, a few weeks later, he came in, blown away, and said, I want to buy three boxes of this stuff to give my friends and family.
[00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:45.969]  It's simply amazing.
[00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:47.290]  He said, why does it work so well?
[00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.854]  And I said, listen, go to Infowarslife.com, watch the informational videos with Dr. Group and others.
[00:18:52.074 --> 00:18:53.575]  They understand how it all works.
[00:18:53.855 --> 00:18:55.436]  I know that it works for me.
[00:18:55.556 --> 00:18:56.697]  That's all I understand.
[00:18:56.957 --> 00:19:02.001]  The science, the facts, the research, people's testimonials, they're all on Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:02.021 --> 00:19:03.002]  You can check it out for yourself.
[00:19:03.602 --> 00:19:04.683]  I wanted to go to the gym.
[00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:14.788]  I wanted to push myself and work out harder, and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that, which I would have never done.
[00:19:14.808 --> 00:19:17.329]  I never would have done that two years ago.
[00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:21.551]  Shane has said over and over again, more than just libido and energy,
[00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:23.873]  It made him want to get into the gym more.
[00:19:24.214 --> 00:19:25.675]  It made him want to get in better shape.
[00:19:25.715 --> 00:19:28.338]  And believe me, the Steiners have amazing genetics.
[00:19:28.879 --> 00:19:31.322]  His brother is a world champion steer wrestler.
[00:19:31.662 --> 00:19:35.647]  His dad, Bobby Steiner, is a famous world champion bull rider.
[00:19:35.847 --> 00:19:37.509]  They've got natural genetics.
[00:19:37.949 --> 00:19:42.675]  But when you added this to the mix, in Shane's own words, it took him to the next level.
[00:19:54.972 --> 00:19:56.673]  Shane noticed the mental clarity.
[00:19:57.134 --> 00:20:00.616]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass.
[00:20:00.736 --> 00:20:02.037]  He's already completely shredded.
[00:20:02.237 --> 00:20:04.899]  I gotta admit, for me, the biggest effect has been libido.
[00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:11.303]  Now, I've never claimed to have a body like some beach model, but back when I was 20, 22 years old and worked out every day, I looked great.
[00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:17.368]  But over the years and being married, having three kids, working 18 hours a day, I gained basically 100 pounds.
[00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:20.650]  And it's been a long process of losing that weight in the last four years.
[00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.392]  But if you look at the photos and the videos,
[00:20:23.752 --> 00:20:24.112]  We're good to go.
[00:20:42.837 --> 00:20:52.901]  This has actually made me feel so good that here lately, about a year ago, I started training jiu-jitsu and that kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing.
[00:20:52.921 --> 00:21:05.407]  I mean, it's amazing that two years ago I was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now I'm training with MMA fighters and just doing stuff that I never thought that I would be doing ever again.
[00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:07.528]  So, Supermail Vitality has
[00:21:08.408 --> 00:21:08.929]  I don't know.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.140]  You'll love it.
[00:22:03.073 --> 00:22:12.441]  Bottom line folks, you want to discover the power of super male vitality and super female vitality for yourself by visiting InfoWarsLife.com today or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.941]  We're going to talk about the recent situation involving Russia and Turkey.
[00:22:22.961 --> 00:22:24.561]  A lot of he said, she said.
[00:22:25.022 --> 00:22:28.423]  Now we have the Russian foreign minister saying it was a planned provocation.
[00:22:28.923 --> 00:22:30.523]  And now we're having the debate, David.
[00:22:30.743 --> 00:22:32.764]  Did they go over into Turkey?
[00:22:32.804 --> 00:22:34.664]  Did they have a prior warning?
[00:22:34.944 --> 00:22:36.945]  They're saying conflicting reports on that.
[00:22:36.965 --> 00:22:39.206]  They were warned five times, ten times.
[00:22:39.226 --> 00:22:41.146]  They say zero times on the Russian side.
[00:22:41.446 --> 00:22:42.326]  I know you've been following this.
[00:22:42.366 --> 00:22:43.687]  What exactly is going on?
[00:22:43.827 --> 00:22:46.408]  Well, the good news, somebody in the U.S.
[00:22:46.448 --> 00:22:47.468]  government administration
[00:22:48.348 --> 00:22:54.813]  I was maybe trying to de-escalate this, Jakari, because they talked to Reuters and they said it looks like the Russians were in Syrian territory the entire time.
[00:22:55.634 --> 00:22:56.434]  So that would be good.
[00:22:56.814 --> 00:23:04.620]  What we also learned today was they had a press conference and they had the jet pilot who was shot down, who survived, and he said
[00:23:05.546 --> 00:23:07.246]  That he knew the region like the back of his hand.
[00:23:07.266 --> 00:23:09.867]  He couldn't possibly have flown into Turkish airspace.
[00:23:10.267 --> 00:23:11.067]  He was at the controls.
[00:23:11.107 --> 00:23:15.708]  He said Turkey did not give any visual signal or radio signal before the jet was shot at.
[00:23:16.008 --> 00:23:18.489]  He said there were no warnings either by radio or visual.
[00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:20.049]  There was no contact whatsoever.
[00:23:20.069 --> 00:23:26.030]  If they wanted to warn us, they could have shown themselves by taking a parallel course, but there was nothing.
[00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:28.271]  The missile hit the tail of our aircraft suddenly.
[00:23:28.571 --> 00:23:31.192]  We didn't see it in time to do an anti-missile maneuver.
[00:23:31.732 --> 00:23:32.712]  Now at the same time,
[00:23:33.703 --> 00:23:39.527]  The Russian Foreign Minister came out and said, as you mentioned Jakari, that it looks like a planned provocation.
[00:23:39.908 --> 00:23:43.010]  He says, we have serious doubts that it was unintentional.
[00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:46.853]  It looks like a planned provocation, an obvious ambush.
[00:23:47.796 --> 00:23:51.238]  He says, it seems to me there were some contrived statements by NATO members.
[00:23:51.278 --> 00:23:55.400]  He says, we know that they had a meeting yesterday, you can't hide that, that's 28 different countries.
[00:23:55.801 --> 00:23:59.983]  And he says, the fact that they have so many members there, some information leaks out.
[00:24:00.023 --> 00:24:03.385]  He said, we learned that it was very hot in there, very heated debate.
[00:24:03.745 --> 00:24:06.907]  Turkey was sharply rebuked for the attack on Russia's plane.
[00:24:07.904 --> 00:24:10.468]  Okay, so all of this looks very similar.
[00:24:10.508 --> 00:24:14.053]  This could be just one side saying this, one side saying the other thing.
[00:24:14.073 --> 00:24:14.353]  Yes.
[00:24:14.533 --> 00:24:22.344]  Except, as I mentioned yesterday, there were questions about why there were so many professional television broadcasters at the same time.
[00:24:22.384 --> 00:24:23.626]  Yes, that's a very good question.
[00:24:23.866 --> 00:24:24.226]  Exactly.
[00:24:24.246 --> 00:24:34.092]  There was a private Turkish broadcaster, Haberturk TV, but there was also footage from Turkey's Anadolu Agency, which would be an official government agency.
[00:24:34.112 --> 00:24:38.134]  So you had multiple professional agencies who just happened to be there at the time.
[00:24:38.454 --> 00:24:44.217]  The Russian pilot who survived says there was no warning, which is typical protocol that you want to do before you shoot down another jet.
[00:24:45.236 --> 00:24:51.403]  But I think all of this shows that this is something that is a deliberate, provocative thing.
[00:24:51.664 --> 00:24:56.870]  I do agree with the Russian Foreign Minister because of the presence of these TV production facilities there.
[00:24:57.298 --> 00:25:00.639]  Yeah, because when we talk about TV production, a lot of people don't understand this.
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.640]  News is very reactive.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:09.943]  Some stations, they have things like police scanners, so in some cases, you may get there before the police, but you still have to have a lead time to get there.
[00:25:09.963 --> 00:25:15.206]  If we go hear about a situation at UT, we have to get in the car, load up the cameras, and go over there and get there.
[00:25:15.266 --> 00:25:16.746]  And then you have traffic and everything else.
[00:25:16.806 --> 00:25:19.528]  Of course, a camera crew just be standing right there.
[00:25:19.648 --> 00:25:20.428]  Two camera crews.
[00:25:20.448 --> 00:25:22.209]  Two camera crews standing right there.
[00:25:23.329 --> 00:25:24.090]  Convenient.
[00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.215]  And we read a tweet yesterday from a guy who says, well, did they just get lucky?
[00:25:27.395 --> 00:25:31.080]  You know, I mean, that seems a little bit far-fetched, but let's take a look.
[00:25:32.091 --> 00:25:34.453]  At what Drudge pointed out yesterday in his tweet.
[00:25:34.713 --> 00:25:36.534]  He said, a shocking truth is unfolding.
[00:25:37.015 --> 00:25:39.036]  America has been arming ISIS.
[00:25:39.536 --> 00:25:41.177]  And I think that's precisely the point.
[00:25:41.197 --> 00:25:48.643]  That's what we need to focus on to keep them from panicking us in a state of fear and uncertainty and doubt about what's going on.
[00:25:49.023 --> 00:25:51.965]  To keep them from panicking us into getting involved in this war.
[00:25:52.005 --> 00:25:54.607]  Let's play this clip from John McCain talking to Neil Cavuto.
[00:25:55.285 --> 00:25:57.307]  We need to have a no-fly zone.
[00:25:57.347 --> 00:25:59.388]  We need to have a buffer zone for refugees.
[00:25:59.448 --> 00:26:01.090]  We need to provide certain kinds of help.
[00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:11.498]  No, I know that Senator, but if they are attacking the very guys who we want to see topple aside, you would let American planes just pass them and let them do that?
[00:26:11.578 --> 00:26:12.659]  Okay, hold it right there.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.441]  Listen to what Neil Cavuto is saying.
[00:26:15.362 --> 00:26:22.867]  If they're attacking our guys, the guys that we want to get in power, that's more important than stopping ISIS, isn't it?
[00:26:23.808 --> 00:26:32.153]  So he's saying, Senator McCain, if they're attacking the guys that we want to replace in this political game, just so they can get to ISIS, are we going to let them do that?
[00:26:32.173 --> 00:26:34.095]  Or are we going to shoot them down?
[00:26:34.435 --> 00:26:35.836]  And this is what McCain has to say.
[00:26:36.456 --> 00:26:42.500]  No, but I might do what we did in Afghanistan many years ago to give those guys the ability to shoot down those planes.
[00:26:42.941 --> 00:26:44.982]  That equipment is available.
[00:26:46.031 --> 00:26:46.371]  Yeah.
[00:26:46.411 --> 00:26:47.392]  Who would be shooting him down?
[00:26:48.232 --> 00:26:49.733]  The Free Syrian Army.
[00:26:49.753 --> 00:26:51.074]  The Free Syrian Army?
[00:26:51.114 --> 00:26:51.374]  Yeah.
[00:26:51.434 --> 00:27:04.201]  Because as you know, David, it was a couple years ago, he goes to Syria, he's taking pictures with the Free Syrian Army, aka the Al Qaeda rebels, and he's saying, I know these guys well, and all this stuff, and then it comes out that they're actually terrorists.
[00:27:04.221 --> 00:27:06.002]  He's like, I have no idea who these guys were.
[00:27:06.102 --> 00:27:07.323]  They photobombed me, basically.
[00:27:07.343 --> 00:27:08.103]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:08.123 --> 00:27:08.844]  He doesn't know who they are.
[00:27:09.344 --> 00:27:13.008]  And of course, when he's talking about, yeah, we know how to do that, we did that in Afghanistan.
[00:27:13.028 --> 00:27:15.690]  Who did they give the missiles to shoot down Russian planes to?
[00:27:16.191 --> 00:27:16.651]  Mujahideen.
[00:27:16.671 --> 00:27:19.334]  Yeah, the Mujahideen and Osama Bin Laden, okay?
[00:27:19.374 --> 00:27:20.815]  The guys who became Al-Qaeda.
[00:27:20.835 --> 00:27:26.040]  They keep rebranding them, hoping that we're not going to connect the dots, that we forget that all this stuff is there.
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.902]  But as you point out, there's a free Syrian army.
[00:27:27.942 --> 00:27:33.987]  And when we showed that clip of those guys shooting the rescue helicopter with a TOW missile,
[00:27:34.898 --> 00:27:39.102]  We zoomed in on that yesterday and we showed the American riding a clearly an American towed missile.
[00:27:39.162 --> 00:27:39.382]  Yes.
[00:27:39.762 --> 00:27:42.265]  Okay, that was a free Syrian Army video.
[00:27:42.825 --> 00:27:47.930]  Okay, these guys are shouting Allah Akbar and as Kurt Nemo pointed out yesterday,
[00:27:48.959 --> 00:27:55.142]  He said, McCain likes to talk about these guys as if they're his buddies, good old boys from Arizona, but they're nothing of the sort.
[00:27:55.342 --> 00:27:59.364]  He's got a quote from Ayub Nuri, who says, the FSA's not moderate.
[00:27:59.464 --> 00:28:00.364]  It doesn't claim to be.
[00:28:00.424 --> 00:28:03.205]  Most of its leaders and commanders have a strong jihadist tendency.
[00:28:03.545 --> 00:28:06.287]  They call their war against Damascus a holy war.
[00:28:06.727 --> 00:28:09.748]  FSA units and brigades carry Islamic names.
[00:28:09.768 --> 00:28:12.609]  Their black headbands are adorned with Quranic verses.
[00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:17.952]  They also launch their attacks and fire rockets with the cry of Allah Akbar.
[00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:20.032]  Exactly what we saw yesterday.
[00:28:20.872 --> 00:28:32.897]  They're shooting a rescue helicopter, they're shooting pilots parachuting peacefully out of a plane, which is not what you would expect from our buddies, our guys back in Arizona, right?
[00:28:32.917 --> 00:28:36.418]  They're acting like terrorists, and of course, blowing up the rescue helicopter.
[00:28:36.439 --> 00:28:39.280]  And then today, we have footage showing
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:46.462]  These guys were using an anti-tank missile, blowing up Russian journalists close by in that area, in a car!
[00:28:46.822 --> 00:28:58.025]  So, you know, if they look like terrorists, they act like terrorists, they use the terrorist slogans, they're shooting journalists, they're shooting rescue helicopters, they're shooting people in parachutes, they are terrorists!
[00:28:58.105 --> 00:28:59.665]  And they are the Free Syrian Army!
[00:29:00.066 --> 00:29:01.006]  And of course, I guess...
[00:29:02.196 --> 00:29:07.999]  We could have John McCain celebrating dancing, you know, because that equipment is now available.
[00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:09.700]  How did that equipment become available?
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:18.605]  We pointed out back in October 10th on InfoWars, Saudi Arabia delivered 500 of these TOW anti-tank missiles to the Free Syrian Army.
[00:29:19.166 --> 00:29:20.026]  Same guys again.
[00:29:20.086 --> 00:29:21.547]  There's John McCain dancing.
[00:29:22.007 --> 00:29:28.711]  BBC correspondent Frank Gardner tweeted that a Saudi official confirmed the delivery of 500 TOW anti-tank missiles to the FSA.
[00:29:29.713 --> 00:29:34.718]  I said the delivery of TOW missiles were also provided by the CIA.
[00:29:35.338 --> 00:29:39.802]  So let's go back to, is there really a connection with these guys and the terrorists?
[00:29:39.882 --> 00:29:40.703]  Are they really terrorists?
[00:29:40.723 --> 00:29:46.088]  I mean, they certainly, you know, they look like terrorists, they talk like terrorists, they shout like terrorists.
[00:29:46.128 --> 00:29:46.889]  I think they're terrorists.
[00:29:47.229 --> 00:29:49.571]  But of course, this has been brought up before.
[00:29:49.651 --> 00:29:51.773]  We've had reports coming out, military reports.
[00:29:51.793 --> 00:29:55.497]  Sean Hannity confronted John McCain with this, and this is what McCain said.
[00:29:55.917 --> 00:29:59.818]  I am concerned about this report about Syrian rebels and the ceasefire with ISIS.
[00:30:00.639 --> 00:30:01.759]  Senator Paul... That's not true.
[00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:02.919]  It's not true.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.800]  It's not true.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.220]  I don't care about the report.
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.541]  I know these people intimately.
[00:30:07.601 --> 00:30:09.542]  We talk to them all the time.
[00:30:10.042 --> 00:30:11.182]  I don't care about the report.
[00:30:11.302 --> 00:30:12.523]  I know these people intimately.
[00:30:12.563 --> 00:30:14.503]  We talk to them all the time.
[00:30:14.703 --> 00:30:15.223]  Exactly.
[00:30:15.303 --> 00:30:17.244]  So, he says, I don't want to hear this report.
[00:30:17.464 --> 00:30:19.605]  And he just keeps talking over him until he shuts up.
[00:30:20.532 --> 00:30:22.153]  He says, we know these people intimately.
[00:30:22.694 --> 00:30:23.635]  We talk to them all the time.
[00:30:23.675 --> 00:30:30.660]  Well, just this week we had Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, during Obama's tenure.
[00:30:31.101 --> 00:30:35.785]  He was on the Kelly file and he talked about manipulation of ISIS intelligence.
[00:30:35.825 --> 00:30:38.407]  And he said, it's so bad, we need to have an investigation.
[00:30:38.847 --> 00:30:41.850]  Understand that when we had McCain running against Obama,
[00:30:42.742 --> 00:30:44.744]  They're both going to do the same thing for the globalists.
[00:30:45.104 --> 00:30:48.867]  Okay, we were given a choice of an old white guy or a young charismatic black guy.
[00:30:48.927 --> 00:30:49.607]  That was all it was.
[00:30:49.687 --> 00:30:51.368]  It was rigged so that Obama would win this.
[00:30:51.829 --> 00:30:52.910]  But are they really terrorists?
[00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:56.372]  This is a truth, as Drudge points out, that's been unfolding.
[00:30:57.233 --> 00:30:58.734]  It's been unfolding for quite some time.
[00:30:58.794 --> 00:31:05.979]  Going back to 2013, this article we had from Infowars, Free Syrian Army Rebels Defect to Islamist Group Jabhat al-Nusra.
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.682]  And these were fighters who were defecting at the time.
[00:31:10.042 --> 00:31:10.523]  In December 17, 2013,
[00:31:12.344 --> 00:31:16.867]  Top Free Syrian Army Commander defects to Al-Qaeda linked group.
[00:31:16.967 --> 00:31:19.509]  This guy was named Jamal.
[00:31:19.589 --> 00:31:21.170]  He was Saddam Al-Jamal.
[00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:22.931]  He headed the Al-Akbar Brigade.
[00:31:23.292 --> 00:31:25.854]  Oh, they sound like our moderate rebels, don't they?
[00:31:26.074 --> 00:31:27.054]  The Al-Akbar Brigade.
[00:31:27.295 --> 00:31:28.776]  He was a top FSA commander.
[00:31:28.836 --> 00:31:31.557]  He then went more openly to Al-Qaeda.
[00:31:32.898 --> 00:31:37.943]  In 2012, we had Hula eyewitnesses saying the Free Syrian Army was responsible for a massacre.
[00:31:38.343 --> 00:31:47.871]  This is a situation where they entered a city, they secured it, then they began killing people in a cleansing action against loyalists to Assad.
[00:31:48.791 --> 00:31:51.173]  Executing elderly people, women and also children.
[00:31:51.493 --> 00:31:54.776]  The dead were put on display for the United Nations and corporate media.
[00:31:54.996 --> 00:31:57.899]  They were portrayed as victims of Assad's military.
[00:31:58.806 --> 00:32:04.548]  Nevertheless, they went back and they talked to the eyewitnesses, and you can see that video that's linked in that article.
[00:32:04.608 --> 00:32:05.228]  Then, another one.
[00:32:05.468 --> 00:32:11.810]  August 12, 2012, UN designates Free Syrian Army affiliates as Al-Qaeda.
[00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:12.650]  That's the UN.
[00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:13.170]  That's the UN.
[00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:13.771]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:32:13.791 --> 00:32:15.091]  Thank you so much, David.
[00:32:15.111 --> 00:32:18.412]  You guys can find all these reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:32:27.156 --> 00:32:36.423]  You guys have the exclusive for which is a product called Deep Cleanse and why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula almost like the iodine crystals.
[00:32:36.503 --> 00:32:40.285]  We have two unique products that nobody in the world has.
[00:32:40.666 --> 00:32:52.434]  One of the most amazing ingredients in the world and it's called Shilajit and it's actually known as blood of the mountain or rock sweat because thousands of years ago as a matter of fact this ingredient
[00:32:52.634 --> 00:32:59.038]  Was only given to the elite of the elite thousands of years ago up in the Himalayan mountains and in Tibet.
[00:32:59.078 --> 00:33:02.901]  And we wanted to put this in stuff for a couple years, but we couldn't get an organic form.
[00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:03.301]  Right.
[00:33:03.401 --> 00:33:04.422]  I mean, let's explain.
[00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:07.624]  I mean, this stuff's so good, we couldn't put it out for years.
[00:33:07.904 --> 00:33:16.353]  Right, so I had to actually, it's kind of like the iodine crystals, finding a source deep in the earth that we could get the cleanest source available.
[00:33:16.793 --> 00:33:26.363]  But in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan mountains, thousands of years ago they found, they watched these monkeys and during the summer months the monkeys would go up into the mountains.
[00:33:26.384 --> 00:33:27.625]  Now you're being racist against monkeys.
[00:33:27.665 --> 00:33:28.306]  And they would pick
[00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:31.207]  This black substance from the mountains.
[00:33:31.668 --> 00:33:38.171]  And so in Russia, they actually, it grows in Russia and the mountains and in the Himalayas and only in the summer.
[00:33:38.272 --> 00:33:46.476]  And shilajit is actually the decomposition of up to 7,000 different medicinal herbs.
[00:33:46.536 --> 00:33:53.200]  So it decomposes, all these different herbs decompose in the Himalayan mountains and the volcanic soil up there.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.483]  And what happens in the summertime... So it's almost like an oil from
[00:33:58.343 --> 00:34:01.046]  Yes, it's high in fulvic acid, it's high in humic acid.
[00:34:01.086 --> 00:34:05.411]  Because they're always claiming oil is really from decomposed animals and plants.
[00:34:05.972 --> 00:34:10.417]  There is some oil that is based from fossils, but most of it's really abiotic.
[00:34:10.818 --> 00:34:14.823]  So this is a true fossil source?
[00:34:14.843 --> 00:34:15.583]  I mean, explain it to me.
[00:34:16.284 --> 00:34:16.624]  It is.
[00:34:17.024 --> 00:34:22.345]  It's really the decomposition, like I said, of over 7,000 different medicinal herbs and plants.
[00:34:22.505 --> 00:34:26.306]  And with the rocks and the pressure deep in the mountains, it freezes.
[00:34:26.386 --> 00:34:31.327]  And during the summertime and the pressures build it up, it oozes out.
[00:34:31.427 --> 00:34:33.007]  So it literally oozes out of the mountain.
[00:34:33.027 --> 00:34:33.827]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:34.187 --> 00:34:35.188]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:35.228 --> 00:34:38.348]  It's black and it's highly nutritious.
[00:34:39.188 --> 00:34:41.809]  Even in the 1980s, when the Olympic
[00:34:42.529 --> 00:34:44.850]  Athletes in Russia were accused of being on steroids.
[00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:52.231]  They found out that they were actually been given Shilajit because it works as an anabolic as well and it builds muscles.
[00:34:52.431 --> 00:34:53.491]  It's a big dose in there.
[00:34:53.511 --> 00:35:03.234]  The second big main ingredient in there is a volcanic zeolite concentrate and what this formula is designed to do, the Shilajit and the zeolites have a real strong negative charge.
[00:35:03.694 --> 00:35:08.615]  All the metals and chemicals and PCBs and VOCs have positive charges.
[00:35:09.415 --> 00:35:17.522]  So these go in, they grab it, and then they safely eliminate it through the body so you can become healthy.
[00:35:17.563 --> 00:35:21.506]  I mean, this is an amazing formula.
[00:35:21.646 --> 00:35:27.512]  I wish I actually had it, but because this was an exclusive InfoWars Life product, you're the only one in the world that has.
[00:35:28.132 --> 00:35:36.039]  This formula now and, you know, there is going to be a limited supply available when you sell out because you can only harvest this once a year.
[00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:37.260]  How do people take it?
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.622]  How is it recommended that this be done?
[00:35:39.722 --> 00:35:41.424]  Just a daily dose?
[00:35:41.704 --> 00:35:43.446]  Yeah, daily dose.
[00:35:43.526 --> 00:35:44.907]  The instructions are on the label.
[00:35:44.927 --> 00:35:48.330]  You know, of course, I kind of modify it for each individual.
[00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:49.931]  It depends on what your lifestyle is.
[00:35:49.971 --> 00:35:55.076]  I mean, honestly, the best thing to do is for you to avoid all these chemicals and toxins in your environment.
[00:35:55.376 --> 00:35:55.456]  Yeah.
[00:36:17.495 --> 00:36:18.397]  These aren't just great products.
[00:36:18.417 --> 00:36:20.200]  This is how we fund this independent operation.
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:25.428]  We're not taxpayer-funded like MSNBC or NPR, and neither is your local station, so support them, folks.
[00:36:25.628 --> 00:36:26.249]  This is a war.
[00:36:32.816 --> 00:36:40.768]  Just how long can the international community pretend to keep its dirty secret in the proverbial closet that they actually support ISIS?
[00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:48.020]  Lines are clearly being drawn as NATO ally Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter and then shot the ejected pilots dead.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.801]  As they descended in parachutes, claiming the jet was in Turkish airspace.
[00:36:53.081 --> 00:36:57.582]  Putin claimed the jet was down 4 kilometers from the Turkish border in Syria.
[00:36:57.882 --> 00:37:12.086]  As Putin expressed outrage, calling the attack a stab in the back and threatened consequences, the Russian rescue helicopter attending to the downed jet was shot down as well, fired on by Obama's supposed moderate Syrian rebels.
[00:37:24.815 --> 00:37:44.982]  I do think that this points to an ongoing problem with the Russian operations in the sense that they are operating very close to a Turkish border and they are going after moderate opposition that are supported by not only Turkey but a wide range of countries.
[00:37:45.902 --> 00:37:55.910]  The incident occurred just days after Turkish officials warned Russia to immediately end its operation against ISIS after warplanes bombed border regions.
[00:37:56.370 --> 00:38:00.874]  Recently, it was revealed the Obama White House is giving ISIS a 45-minute warning.
[00:38:02.395 --> 00:38:09.457]  before bombing their oil tankers by dropping leaflets advising potential jihadists to flee before airstrikes in Syria.
[00:38:09.757 --> 00:38:19.740]  The leaflet drops are justified under the premise that the oil tanker drivers might be civilians and not ISIS recruits, although it's an explanation that doesn't wash with critics.
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:20.520]  J.E.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:26.302]  Dyer writes, it's not like these drivers are innocent, uninvolved civilians like children or sick people.
[00:38:26.502 --> 00:38:33.327]  They're waging ISIS's war just like the other non-uniformed participants who make up 100% of ISIS's ranks.
[00:38:33.647 --> 00:38:40.051]  This is how far the Obama administration is going to avoid collateral damage, while it took the U.S.
[00:38:40.692 --> 00:38:45.275]  15 months to even begin targeting ISIS oil refineries and tankers.
[00:38:45.575 --> 00:38:51.900]  Airstrikes by Moscow destroyed more than 1,000 tankers in a period of just five days.
[00:38:52.401 --> 00:38:55.523]  In comparison, Colonel Steve Warren said the U.S.
[00:38:55.563 --> 00:38:58.666]  had taken out only 116 tanker trucks.
[00:38:59.126 --> 00:38:59.427]  U.S.
[00:38:59.507 --> 00:39:02.109]  airstrikes targeting ISIS oil assets
[00:39:02.589 --> 00:39:13.317]  are so rare that PBS was caught using footage of Russian fighter jets bombing an oil storage facility in Syria and passing it off as evidence of the U.S.
[00:39:13.398 --> 00:39:16.080]  targeting the Islamic State's oil infrastructure.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:16.900]  U.S.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:27.749]  military pilots have also confirmed that they were ordered not to drop 75% of their ordnance on ISIS targets because they couldn't get clearance from their superiors.
[00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:36.819]  The never-ending holiday propaganda campaign of fear is underway as the State Department has issued terror warnings for every holiday since September 11, 2001.
[00:39:37.039 --> 00:39:42.886]  It is particularly fond of frightening people around Thanksgiving and Christmas.
[00:39:43.146 --> 00:39:44.568]  This year is no exception.
[00:39:44.808 --> 00:39:48.192]  On Monday, the State Department issued a worldwide travel alert.
[00:39:48.352 --> 00:39:49.833]  You're not safe anywhere.
[00:39:50.034 --> 00:39:52.436]  This travel alert expires on February 24, 2016.
[00:39:53.778 --> 00:40:03.108]  The alert posted on the State Department's website says, if you plan to travel abroad during the holiday, the government says you should register with them.
[00:40:03.468 --> 00:40:15.774]  Incidentally, in standard bullying doublespeak, Jay Johnson at the Department of Homeland Security declared, "...there is no specific credible or imminent terror threat at this time, and you may safely travel."
[00:40:16.154 --> 00:40:31.162]  As the NATO allies and New World Order stalwarts impatiently sit on their hands, it is beginning to become abundantly clear the collateral damage to the hidden globalist-backed ISIS campaign Russia is racking up is reaching a breaking point.
[00:40:31.542 --> 00:40:33.585]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:40:51.348 --> 00:41:06.758]  Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, has finally announced that Sweden is no longer capable of maintaining the crushing weight of the hordes of Syrian refugees flooding the country.
[00:41:06.878 --> 00:41:08.660]  The numbers don't lie.
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:16.405]  10,000 migrants a week and an estimate of 190,000 new refugees will inhabit Sweden by the end of the year.
[00:41:16.705 --> 00:41:21.248]  Not to mention a rape epidemic sweeping Europe, transforming Sweden into the rape capital.
[00:41:21.288 --> 00:41:21.668]  We're good.
[00:41:38.807 --> 00:41:39.968]  Soft invasion.
[00:41:40.228 --> 00:41:50.072]  Sweden's past success was in part related to careful reforms and fiscal responsibilities now being exploited by Prime Minister Lofven's controllers.
[00:41:50.532 --> 00:42:04.558]  Urien Mason writes that in 2013 Lofven's press secretary announced that the newly elected leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party will be present at Bilderberg at the invite of Swedish philanthropist Jacob Wallenberg.
[00:42:04.798 --> 00:42:09.579]  Wallenberg was one of 35 members of the Bilderberg steering committee in 2013.
[00:42:10.699 --> 00:42:13.180]  Bilderberg's brainchild was the EU.
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:21.841]  Its financial control over the EU's socialist leaders, sponsoring the soft invasion of refugees, is blatantly obvious.
[00:42:22.101 --> 00:42:29.103]  And just two years after Lofven attended Bilderberg, by all accounts Sweden could be facing a collapse.
[00:42:31.132 --> 00:42:36.595]  Right now we receive between 50,000 to 80,000 people a month.
[00:42:39.957 --> 00:42:52.365]  We can only offer them tents for shelter and right now it's going to get to winter time here and it's about to turn between minus 20 to minus 30 Celsius.
[00:42:53.527 --> 00:43:00.849]  This has come to a point where you no longer can call it racism, because the picture is so much bigger than that, and it's come down to humanity.
[00:43:01.429 --> 00:43:04.510]  And right now, Sweden can't manage.
[00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:15.953]  We are sacrificing our elderly, we are sacrificing our preschools, our kindergartens, our school system, our elderly care, and the welfare system as it is.
[00:43:16.886 --> 00:43:19.811]  If you say this in Sweden, you're considered a racist.
[00:43:20.352 --> 00:43:31.870]  Even if you never say that we're going to stop immigration, we have to kick everybody out, it's considered racism to criticize the politics for immigration and asylum.
[00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:36.512]  The refugees in Sweden have mistaken kindness for weakness.
[00:43:36.853 --> 00:43:40.915]  The Scandinavian Viking berserker rage is beginning to boil.
[00:43:41.135 --> 00:43:46.299]  Protesters in Sweden have burned down 17 immigration centers in the past two months.
[00:43:46.619 --> 00:43:51.742]  But the refugees continue to stoke the fire, bringing the violence of Syria to their hosts.
[00:43:52.082 --> 00:44:00.428]  Immigrant riots spring up weekly in Sweden, and refugees in Malmö, Sweden, are blowing up cars and police vehicles with grenade attacks.
[00:44:00.828 --> 00:44:05.472]  Now, phase two of the Bilderbergers' invasion is rolling out in the United States.
[00:44:05.872 --> 00:44:20.165]  The Washington Examiner writes, President Obama's open-door immigration policy is set to accept more immigrants from Muslim nations over the next five years than the entire population of Washington, D.C., according to federal documents.
[00:44:20.525 --> 00:44:25.509]  Figures from the Department of Homeland Security show that the president has already issued 680,000 green cards
[00:44:27.751 --> 00:44:28.191]  We're good to go.
[00:45:04.048 --> 00:45:14.810]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:17.350]  It's time to stop submitting to this tyranny!
[00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:19.631]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:45:20.251 --> 00:45:23.051]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[00:45:24.552 --> 00:45:27.272]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[00:45:27.432 --> 00:45:31.033]  Tyranny with a capital T. You should reject these voices.
[00:45:31.793 --> 00:45:33.113]  Everything that's been done
[00:45:34.312 --> 00:45:50.823]  With torture, vendition, the NDAA, the Patriot Acts 1 and 2, from day one, was focused on the American people, period.
[00:45:52.224 --> 00:45:52.664]  That's it.
[00:45:53.817 --> 00:46:02.324]  It's always been about erasing the Bill of Rights and Constitution and rolling out NSA spying publicly, saying it's for Al Qaeda.
[00:46:02.764 --> 00:46:06.848]  Rolling out torture, saying it's for Al Qaeda, but it's really for the general public.
[00:46:07.188 --> 00:46:15.795]  Rolling out total control and the end of any underground free market systems in the name of fighting Al Qaeda, but really shutting down any type of free commerce.
[00:46:16.255 --> 00:46:18.217]  This is all about converting us
[00:46:18.737 --> 00:46:24.256]  From a free society to a tyranny with a capital T.
[00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:44.387]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:46:44.727 --> 00:46:46.208]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:46:46.228 --> 00:46:47.610]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:48.991]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:46:49.552 --> 00:46:54.336]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:54.436 --> 00:46:58.540]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.401]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:47:00.421 --> 00:47:01.763]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:47:01.803 --> 00:47:03.925]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:07.915 --> 00:47:12.757]  And why wearing a Hillary for President t-shirt might get you punched in the face?
[00:47:13.157 --> 00:47:15.018]  They thought it said Hillary for President.
[00:47:15.878 --> 00:47:20.339]  He said, I was seconds away from sending my bar back over here to punch you in the face.
[00:47:20.579 --> 00:47:24.441]  Since you're wearing a Hillary for Prison shirt, you don't have to buy drinks here.
[00:47:24.721 --> 00:47:25.821]  Everything's on the house.
[00:47:26.301 --> 00:47:27.362]  Hillary for President!
[00:47:28.022 --> 00:47:29.723]  Hillary's not surging, I tell you that.
[00:47:29.763 --> 00:47:30.503]  They're not saying that.
[00:47:31.503 --> 00:47:32.164]  They're not saying that.
[00:47:32.944 --> 00:47:33.264]  Thank you.
[00:48:04.986 --> 00:48:05.566]  There you have it.
[00:48:05.646 --> 00:48:08.407]  Donald Trump endorses Hillary for prison.
[00:48:08.987 --> 00:48:13.109]  Get your Hillary for prison 2016 t-shirt at the Infowars store.
[00:48:13.389 --> 00:48:16.010]  And on the back it says, legalize freedom.
[00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:20.151]  Show your disapproval of Hillary by buying your t-shirt today.
[00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.711]  But what she's done is criminal.
[00:48:22.872 --> 00:48:25.453]  This is an American president.
[00:48:25.793 --> 00:48:26.933]  Just add puppet.
[00:48:27.313 --> 00:48:29.634]  Then vote and repeat every four years.
[00:48:38.272 --> 00:48:39.738]  We're good.
[00:48:52.403 --> 00:48:56.366]  Prepare yourself for a perfectly outrageous motion picture.
[00:48:56.386 --> 00:49:06.554]  Howard Beale went up there last night and said what every American feels, that he's tired of all the bull... For God's sakes, Diana, we're talking about putting a manifestly irresponsible man on national television.
[00:49:06.574 --> 00:49:09.956]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:49:11.638 --> 00:49:12.779]  There is no America.
[00:49:13.619 --> 00:49:15.120]  There is no democracy.
[00:49:16.141 --> 00:49:17.042]  There is only...
[00:49:17.873 --> 00:49:26.537]  IBM, and ITT, and AT&T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon.
[00:49:27.578 --> 00:49:30.099]  Those are the nations of the world today.
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:36.222]  And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature!
[00:49:38.023 --> 00:49:42.406]  And you will atone!
[00:49:43.866 --> 00:49:45.127]  Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale?
[00:49:46.348 --> 00:49:46.748]  Why me?
[00:49:47.466 --> 00:49:49.207]  That was your own television, dummy.
[00:49:50.147 --> 00:49:54.049]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Network News Hour with Howard Beale!
[00:49:55.470 --> 00:50:06.275]  I can't do it.
[00:50:07.636 --> 00:50:08.336]  We'll do it live.
[00:50:10.397 --> 00:50:11.358]  We'll do it live!
[00:50:13.078 --> 00:50:13.859]  Do it live!
[00:50:14.059 --> 00:50:16.020]  I'll write it and we'll do it live!
[00:50:18.339 --> 00:50:19.203]  This thing sucks!
[00:50:20.267 --> 00:50:21.211]  What the hell's going on?
[00:50:21.552 --> 00:50:23.400]  I don't know, he just said he was gonna blow his brains out.
[00:50:24.022 --> 00:50:26.063]  That's tomorrow, and that is it for us today.
[00:50:26.163 --> 00:50:26.943]  I'm Bill O'Reilly.
[00:50:26.983 --> 00:50:28.023]  Thanks again for watching.
[00:50:28.063 --> 00:50:30.904]  We'll leave you with Sting and a cut off his new album.
[00:50:31.024 --> 00:50:31.584]  Take it away.
[00:50:31.784 --> 00:50:33.545]  Congressman, let me interrupt you just for a moment.
[00:50:33.565 --> 00:50:35.285]  We've got some breaking news out of Miami.
[00:50:35.506 --> 00:50:36.466]  Stand by if you will.
[00:50:37.586 --> 00:50:41.467]  Right now in Miami, Justin Bieber has been arrested on a number of charges.
[00:50:41.527 --> 00:50:47.349]  The judge is reading the charges, including resisting arrest and driving under the influence.
[00:50:47.389 --> 00:50:49.870]  He's appearing now before the judge for his bond hearing.
[00:50:51.651 --> 00:50:53.031]  I want a show developed.
[00:50:53.735 --> 00:50:56.600]  Based on the activities of a terrorist group.
[00:50:57.842 --> 00:50:58.763]  Well, I'm in.
[00:50:58.783 --> 00:51:00.807]  I'm gonna make a TV star out of you.
[00:51:01.459 --> 00:51:02.940]  You're going to be a household word.
[00:51:03.281 --> 00:51:05.323]  Osama Bin Laden is just one person.
[00:51:06.003 --> 00:51:16.653]  He is representative of networks of people who absolutely have made their cause to defeat the freedoms that we understand.
[00:51:16.953 --> 00:51:18.495]  And we will not allow him to do so.
[00:51:18.515 --> 00:51:24.240]  The death of Bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat Al Qaeda.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.682]  The Taliban is taking responsibility for shooting down a U.S.
[00:51:27.702 --> 00:51:28.342]  helicopter.
[00:51:28.763 --> 00:51:32.965]  More than 30 people were killed and there are reports this morning that most of them are U.S.
[00:51:33.045 --> 00:51:33.746]  Navy SEALs.
[00:51:34.266 --> 00:51:40.490]  It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet.
[00:51:41.929 --> 00:51:44.210]  NATO is in command of the entire U.S.
[00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:45.331]  military publicly.
[00:51:45.931 --> 00:51:50.193]  Homeland Security now says their mission has nothing to do with Al-Qaeda, our Muslim extremists.
[00:51:50.253 --> 00:51:55.556]  It has to do with the Tea Party, who will launch police-killing terror attacks any minute.
[00:51:56.196 --> 00:51:58.798]  With no evidence of that, now it's beginning.
[00:51:59.338 --> 00:52:01.359]  The borders are completely wide open.
[00:52:01.799 --> 00:52:05.081]  Tens of millions of people are flooding here as we speak.
[00:52:05.401 --> 00:52:11.904]  Hundreds of thousands a month pouring over the borders, being given driver's license in California to pull the lever to ban guns.
[00:52:12.344 --> 00:52:16.626]  We are in the middle of a globalist revolution against this country right now.
[00:52:17.347 --> 00:52:18.767]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[00:52:19.268 --> 00:52:20.428]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[00:52:21.028 --> 00:52:21.789]  It's a depression.
[00:52:22.969 --> 00:52:25.851]  Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job.
[00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:28.772]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[00:52:29.233 --> 00:52:30.254]  Banks are going bust.
[00:52:30.334 --> 00:52:32.257]  Shopkeepers keep a gun to the counter.
[00:52:32.878 --> 00:52:34.460]  Punks are running wild in the street.
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:37.043]  There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[00:52:37.424 --> 00:52:37.764]  We know.
[00:52:38.225 --> 00:52:41.389]  The air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat.
[00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:50.696]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be!
[00:52:50.956 --> 00:52:53.037]  We know things are bad, worse than bad!
[00:52:53.618 --> 00:52:54.338]  They're crazy!
[00:52:54.558 --> 00:52:57.580]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore!
[00:52:57.961 --> 00:53:04.865]  We sit in the house, and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms!
[00:53:04.925 --> 00:53:09.268]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radios, and I won't say anything!
[00:53:09.468 --> 00:53:10.289]  Just leave us alone!
[00:53:10.529 --> 00:53:11.890]  Well, I'm not going to leave you alone.
[00:53:12.751 --> 00:53:14.052]  I want you to get maxed!
[00:53:16.274 --> 00:53:16.674]  Network.
[00:53:17.195 --> 00:53:19.437]  Television will never be the same.
[00:53:21.139 --> 00:53:23.121]  Do it.
[00:53:23.161 --> 00:53:24.182]  Get on the ground!
[00:53:24.282 --> 00:53:26.424]  Get on the ground now!
[00:53:26.464 --> 00:53:27.325]  Get on the ground!
[00:53:27.405 --> 00:53:28.706]  Get on the ground!
[00:53:29.487 --> 00:53:32.610]  I love this country so much.
[00:53:35.816 --> 00:53:40.241]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[00:53:40.321 --> 00:53:44.305]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[00:53:44.545 --> 00:53:46.808]  Who are they going to fight a war against?
[00:53:47.008 --> 00:53:51.413]  And just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:53:51.693 --> 00:53:58.895]  Multiple sources tell CNN as many as 40 veterans died while they were waiting for medical care at this VA facility.
[00:53:58.935 --> 00:54:05.858]  Alex Jones may sound crazy, but still has 300 million YouTube... well, 300 million people that have watched him on YouTube.
[00:54:07.178 --> 00:54:18.364]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally, and pop him.
[00:54:18.444 --> 00:54:21.425]  I'd love to see that.
[00:54:21.705 --> 00:54:25.487]  Hey listen, I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up!
[00:54:25.747 --> 00:54:26.648]  This isn't a game!
[00:54:27.328 --> 00:54:29.449]  I want you to get up now.
[00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:32.811]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[00:54:34.164 --> 00:54:44.529]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'M AS MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
[00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:55.155]  I want you to get up right now, stick your head out of the window, open it, and stick your head out and keep yelling and yell, I'M AS MAD AS HELL, I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
[00:54:55.655 --> 00:54:58.977]  Just get up from your chairs, right now, go to the window!
[00:54:59.277 --> 00:54:59.858]  Where are you going?
[00:54:59.878 --> 00:55:01.098]  I don't want to see anybody yelling!
[00:55:01.118 --> 00:55:02.579]  Open it and stick your head out!
[00:55:14.727 --> 00:55:16.307]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:55:16.327 --> 00:55:18.008]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:55:18.128 --> 00:55:19.408]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:55:19.428 --> 00:55:20.728]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:55:20.748 --> 00:55:21.909]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:55:21.929 --> 00:55:23.769]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:55:23.789 --> 00:55:25.009]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:55:25.049 --> 00:55:26.410]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:27.550]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:29.210]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:31.711]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:55:31.751 --> 00:55:34.711]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:55:34.731 --> 00:55:36.232]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:55:36.252 --> 00:55:38.012]  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[00:55:52.475 --> 00:55:54.217]  You know, Australia's a good example.
[00:55:54.437 --> 00:55:55.739]  Canada's a good example.
[00:55:56.279 --> 00:55:57.981]  The UK is a good example.
[00:55:58.041 --> 00:55:58.342]  Why?
[00:55:59.503 --> 00:56:01.365]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[00:56:01.846 --> 00:56:07.032]  Somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue.
[00:56:07.833 --> 00:56:10.355]  Well, this is something we should politicize.
[00:56:11.061 --> 00:56:11.862]  I'm not going to carry a gun.
[00:56:11.882 --> 00:56:13.683]  I don't want to be involved in a gun fight.
[00:56:13.823 --> 00:56:26.450]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:56:31.873 --> 00:56:32.434]  Go ahead.
[00:56:33.474 --> 00:56:34.315]  Make my day.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:38.884]  So the notion that gun laws don't work, it's not borne out by the evidence.
[00:56:39.325 --> 00:56:44.750]  He says that the Chicago police had a plan over this bloody Fourth of July weekend.
[00:56:45.151 --> 00:56:53.620]  Nonetheless, as you indicated, Corey, there was a count of casualties that could have been from Afghanistan or Iraq.
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:54.381]  We'll make it.
[00:56:55.669 --> 00:56:58.551]  Harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns.
[00:56:58.991 --> 00:57:06.176]  In many cases the offenders, felons, some out on parole, some out on bond.
[00:57:06.516 --> 00:57:13.481]  We have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.
[00:57:13.661 --> 00:57:17.103]  There are people at high levels in this government who have
[00:57:18.164 --> 00:57:19.606]  Bodyguards.
[00:57:19.846 --> 00:57:21.768]  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:57:22.109 --> 00:57:24.151]  The average American does not have that.
[00:57:24.491 --> 00:57:28.375]  Mayor Bloomberg, why can you defend yourself but not...
[00:57:29.246 --> 00:57:30.307]  The majority of Americans.
[00:57:30.367 --> 00:57:32.449]  I mean, look at the team of security you've got!
[00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:35.212]  Every day, every school, at every level.
[00:57:35.693 --> 00:57:48.486]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this and we need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:57:48.866 --> 00:57:52.469]  Was this the weapon of choice for a new kind of terrorist?
[00:57:52.810 --> 00:58:01.358]  When a five-year-old girl said she and a classmate should shoot each other with bubbles, the school calls it a terrorist threat.
[00:58:01.498 --> 00:58:03.880]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:58:04.781 --> 00:58:08.784]  You know, the right to bear arms is because that's the last form of defense against tyranny.
[00:58:09.245 --> 00:58:11.247]  Lay down your arms, you damned rebels!
[00:58:12.964 --> 00:58:16.826]  But we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army, or the police.
[00:58:17.126 --> 00:58:18.907]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:58:18.947 --> 00:58:19.948]  would you see that happening?
[00:58:20.008 --> 00:58:24.050]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:58:24.350 --> 00:58:29.733]  ...discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[00:58:30.114 --> 00:58:37.758]  To say, we're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down, if you want them, come and take them!
[00:58:39.494 --> 00:58:43.639]  I'm Jakari Jackson for the Info Wars Nightly News, and we'll see you again tomorrow night.
[00:58:48.823 --> 00:58:49.964]  Knockout is back.
[00:58:50.304 --> 00:59:01.411]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:01.831 --> 00:59:03.532]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:03.993 --> 00:59:13.158]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:13.539 --> 00:59:15.320]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.761]  It's the same price
[00:59:17.481 --> 00:59:23.364]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[00:59:23.904 --> 00:59:30.148]  It's got the GABA, so it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[00:59:30.648 --> 00:59:30.768]  It's $19.95.
[00:59:31.488 --> 00:59:33.830]  You take one or two of these,
[00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:38.213]  And it just is really clean restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[00:59:38.554 --> 00:59:42.477]  It's what I've experienced and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
