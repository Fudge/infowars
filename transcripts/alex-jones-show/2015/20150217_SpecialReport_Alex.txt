[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.401]  Jumping to you with InfoWars.com.
[00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:25.569]  Now a local Fox affiliate out of San Diego, Fox 5, accidentally depicts President Obama as a rape suspect in last night's 10 o'clock news.
[00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.154]  The only suspect in a sex assault at SDSU will not be charged.
[00:00:31.554 --> 00:00:34.315]  Maybe Fox actually got something right for once.
[00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:38.717]  Let's talk about all the different ways that President Obama has raped America.
[00:00:39.117 --> 00:00:41.198]  Is this news editing mistake a Freudian slip?
[00:00:41.898 --> 00:00:46.720]  Are we being gaslighted to subconsciously capitulate our awareness to the rapist-in-chief?
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.804]  Since taking office as the 44th President of the United States, President Barack Hussein Obama has forcibly violated what was left of our constitutional rights.
[00:00:56.284 --> 00:00:59.445]  The National Defense Authorization Act grants his office the power
[00:00:59.974 --> 00:01:00.635]  We're good to go.
[00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.542]  on the poor and delivers a heavy final blow to the struggling middle class.
[00:01:30.042 --> 00:01:41.071]  His hugely unpopular open border policy threatens the very security of the United States as ISIS has clearly shown the ability to slip into America undetected.
[00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:51.939]  Meanwhile, known terror cells train within the United States unmolested, while you and I have our private parts funneled by the TSA just to get on an airplane in the land of the free.
[00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:59.523]  He lied to the American people just like a predator when he claimed that Bush's raising of our debt was irresponsible and unpatriotic.
[00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:09.488]  Then turned around and assaulted our wallets by skyrocketing the debt by another 7.3 trillion dollars while blowing millions on his golf games and vacations.
[00:02:09.928 --> 00:02:20.454]  He promised an end to the war while advancing the New World Order's agenda forward in Benghazi, Syria, Libya, Egypt, and even right here at home by supporting rhetoric that fuels a racist division.
[00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:25.757]  His world, journalists and whistleblowers, bankers and friends that got too close is insatiable.
[00:02:26.357 --> 00:02:37.583]  Michael Hastings, Tom Clancy, Andrew Breitbart, Michael Cormier, Loretta Feudy, Harold Green, Barnaby Jack, Christopher Kelly, Albert Peterson, these are just a few of the names.
[00:02:38.243 --> 00:02:56.542]  All met with suspicious incident threats to his power, and now his vicious, unprecedented aggression is aimpoint blank at the last remaining vestige of free speech as he utilizes the independent FCC and FEC to quietly shut down all opposed to his handler's agenda by regulating the internet.
[00:02:57.122 --> 00:03:12.252]  Now once he has accomplished this, as most of America idly sat by with a hardcore case of Stockholm Syndrome, then the police state that has been rearing its bloodthirsty head will fall into place as the rollout advances as it has been designed in many of the documents we have been showing you.
[00:03:12.412 --> 00:03:13.012]  So there you have it.
[00:03:13.032 --> 00:03:17.655]  Those are the many different ways that President Obama has been raping our great country over the past few years.
[00:03:18.176 --> 00:03:21.838]  The horrible thing is that we still have two more years to go with this.
[00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:23.399]  So stay tuned for more reports.
[00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:25.881]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
