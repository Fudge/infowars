[00:00:00.914 --> 00:00:03.549]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:17.652]  Big Brother.
[00:00:18.332 --> 00:00:19.353]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:21.195]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:22.676]  You want answers?
[00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:24.397]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.998 --> 00:00:28.601]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:33.305]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.791]  Look at this headline.
[00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:45.215]  Russian jets intercept US Predator drones over Syria.
[00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:50.735]  Fox News linking from DrudgeReport.com.
[00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:54.316]  That's the type of craziness that is going on in this world.
[00:00:55.477 --> 00:01:03.280]  And then in the midst of it all, we have one of the biggest trending stories on Google, Facebook, Reddit, all the big sites.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.341]  It's in the top five.
[00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:11.364]  Drudge appearing out of nowhere in Central Texas into our studio yesterday.
[00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:14.707]  Simply amazing.
[00:01:14.747 --> 00:01:20.433]  The interview is in hundreds of publications now, scores of newspapers.
[00:01:20.893 --> 00:01:23.756]  They're playing clips of it on CNN, Fox, you name it.
[00:01:23.776 --> 00:01:26.879]  In fact, so many places are covering it.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.101]  I don't even know where to respond.
[00:01:29.882 --> 00:01:32.284]  This is the opposite of an ego issue for me.
[00:01:33.386 --> 00:01:34.507]  It was very fun.
[00:01:34.687 --> 00:01:34.967]  It was
[00:01:36.437 --> 00:01:39.379]  Enlightening, informative, Drudge is a true sweetheart.
[00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:41.601]  I mean really just a classy guy.
[00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:44.543]  That's what everybody that knows him well has told me and it certainly is true.
[00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:48.786]  But it is surreal.
[00:01:49.887 --> 00:01:51.668]  And I didn't want to come into work today.
[00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.891]  Because I guess you could call it shell shock.
[00:01:57.793 --> 00:02:02.257]  Because, I mean, I'll be in a restaurant and see some top A-list Hollywood star and I could really care less.
[00:02:02.297 --> 00:02:06.460]  In fact, I almost don't want to be around it because it's such a distraction and people act so weird.
[00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:09.082]  But I am starstruck by people like Matt Drudge.
[00:02:09.503 --> 00:02:21.393]  When I say people, there aren't really, there isn't really anybody else that is his peer when it comes to covering globalism, the New World Order, all these real things that are happening.
[00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:25.969]  And so I felt like I should have some reflection on what I was going to cover today.
[00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:37.198]  I thought about it a few hours last night, did a little bit of research a couple hours this morning, but just got caught in the minutia of all the other news and then I get up here on air and I just don't even know what to say.
[00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:45.104]  Because it's bigger than just Matt Drudge coming and visiting InfoWars or the media's response, that it's heresy.
[00:02:47.233 --> 00:03:01.342]  To be around a political leper such as myself because they're the bosses and they dictate who you talk to, who you communicate with in this new dark age attempt to bring in total control over information.
[00:03:03.363 --> 00:03:12.429]  It's the larger issue for me of the responsibility to have such a large audience and to know so many interesting people are tuning in.
[00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.911]  It is crushingly humble.
[00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:16.592]  It is humbling.
[00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:31.708]  And so I just feel like I need time to try to gauge things and assemble the meaning of what's happening in the world.
[00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:37.936]  Not just with Infowars, not just with Drudge Report, not just with the Russian fighter planes and the drones and the...
[00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:45.554]  The fluoride in the water, and the GMO, and the open borders, and Obama saying, nobody wants your guns, conspiracy theorist.
[00:03:46.255 --> 00:03:50.437]  You know, we're not coming for your guns, while they're openly on CNN saying, ban the guns.
[00:03:51.537 --> 00:03:54.159]  And everywhere the globalists are in control, they ban the guns.
[00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:04.504]  I mean, it's just crazy that I'm a major leader in the fight against global tyranny,
[00:04:05.796 --> 00:04:06.776]  That's very scary.
[00:04:07.576 --> 00:04:17.538]  And, you know, Drudge didn't tell me that I couldn't repeat a lot of things he told me last night in a lengthy dinner we had, but he was just pointing out the things I point out as well.
[00:04:17.738 --> 00:04:28.880]  There's just not that many true, contrarian, conservative, constitutionalist, libertarians, free marketers out there.
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.281]  There is at the grassroots around the world, in the country, but
[00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:42.477]  There isn't even really any replacements for a lot of the folks that are getting old.
[00:04:44.978 --> 00:04:58.465]  And then tyranny and all the bizarreness of it and just the running wild of the corrupt class, whether it be at the grassroots or the highest levels, is just a spectacle, a ritual.
[00:04:59.662 --> 00:05:03.685]  Of freaks and criminals and mentally ill people having their way with us.
[00:05:04.265 --> 00:05:05.006]  And Drudge is right.
[00:05:05.086 --> 00:05:06.467]  America is very sick.
[00:05:06.967 --> 00:05:07.867]  Europe is very sick.
[00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:09.228]  The world is very sick.
[00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:18.274]  Presidential candidates today strategize over every last detail of a candidate's image, especially an identity candidate like Hillary.
[00:05:18.574 --> 00:05:22.177]  How important is it for there to be a woman president in the United States?
[00:05:22.967 --> 00:05:29.231]  The National Journal has pointed out that candidates now view soundtracks as a key part of that carefully crafted image.
[00:05:30.151 --> 00:05:34.434]  So, maybe Hillary should choose a campaign song that plays against type.
[00:05:34.574 --> 00:05:35.755]  You know, humble.
[00:05:38.615 --> 00:05:44.497]  Hillary has paid a consulting firm $9,000 to create a soundtrack for her campaign.
[00:05:45.137 --> 00:05:47.778]  I just don't think people would believe this song, though.
[00:05:48.458 --> 00:05:54.700]  She's being abandoned by unions, by multinational corporate donors who are worried.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.321]  44% of her Twitter followers, 1.4 million, are fake.
[00:05:58.921 --> 00:06:01.682]  Maybe her campaign theme should be... Help!
[00:06:02.382 --> 00:06:03.743]  I need somebody!
[00:06:03.983 --> 00:06:04.203]  Help!
[00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:06.163]  Not just anybody!
[00:06:06.263 --> 00:06:08.124]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.

[00:08:22.205 --> 00:08:25.187]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:25.787 --> 00:08:29.989]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:39.915]  One of the greatest works of literature is, of course, A Tale of Two Cities.
[00:08:40.955 --> 00:08:43.877]  I haven't read that book since I was in high school, but I intend to read it again.
[00:08:44.577 --> 00:08:47.439]  But I've read the opening passage many times to myself.
[00:08:49.423 --> 00:08:52.528]  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
[00:08:52.828 --> 00:08:57.175]  And then it goes on to basically repeat that statement in different ways for an entire page.
[00:08:57.736 --> 00:09:04.427]  And the more I live, the longer I live, I come to the realization that is so true.
[00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:14.451]  And you've got to go back and read great literature because as you get older, you see the different angles of it that as a young man, or as a child, you obviously didn't see.
[00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:18.894]  And I know I'm just stating basic known truths of humanity.
[00:09:19.734 --> 00:09:34.004]  But under this globalist, New World Order, scientific dictatorship, common sense is being attacked, it is being overthrown, and these basic truths are not being stated and said.
[00:09:36.377 --> 00:09:41.639]  Because for this system to succeed, reality and common sense must be overthrown.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.161]  And we stand on the precipice here of a stairway to heaven.
[00:09:48.941 --> 00:09:56.864]  A stairway to things so fantastic, the eye has not seen, the ear has not heard how amazing humanity can become.
[00:09:58.004 --> 00:09:59.865]  The heights we can reach.
[00:10:01.561 --> 00:10:06.102]  We also stand on the knife edge of the precipice, leaning towards hell.
[00:10:07.403 --> 00:10:08.503]  Cold and hateful.
[00:10:09.403 --> 00:10:09.943]  Greedy.
[00:10:11.904 --> 00:10:12.404]  Petulant.
[00:10:16.145 --> 00:10:17.025]  And it is awesome.
[00:10:17.125 --> 00:10:18.486]  It's awesome to be awake.
[00:10:19.046 --> 00:10:20.466]  It's awesome to be involved.
[00:10:20.866 --> 00:10:30.249]  It's awesome to conservatively have, let's not exaggerate because I keep saying three million, that's like a five-year-old number, three million terrestrial listeners a day.
[00:10:32.185 --> 00:10:33.946]  On AM, FM, shortwave, things like that.
[00:10:35.288 --> 00:10:36.869]  Micros, pirates, it's a lot bigger.
[00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:43.094]  But a couple million more conservatively with the streams, the podcast, everything else.
[00:10:43.174 --> 00:10:52.481]  I mean, that's awesome that I speak to five million people and I'm not up here bragging that, oh, I've got a big audience, I'm so cool.
[00:10:53.242 --> 00:11:01.309]  It's actually frightening knowing that I'm a stuttering, stammering, mind racing, friendly weasel
[00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.912]  Not a bad weasel, a loving, friendly weasel.
[00:11:04.952 --> 00:11:05.592]  Still a weasel.
[00:11:08.174 --> 00:11:09.835]  And by that, I'm not weaseling anybody.
[00:11:09.895 --> 00:11:12.417]  I'm kind of a weasel in my own life, just weaseling around.
[00:11:13.378 --> 00:11:18.542]  But, weasel or not, I can see the wolves coming for everybody and it freaks me out.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.020]  I'm threatened.
[00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:23.501]  I'm scared.
[00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:28.784]  And when I say I don't have fear, I don't have the manifest fear people think of running and hiding.
[00:11:29.504 --> 00:11:31.125]  Fighting is fear, folks.
[00:11:31.305 --> 00:11:31.745]  Fighting.
[00:11:32.045 --> 00:11:35.126]  You fight by running or by fighting.
[00:11:36.327 --> 00:11:36.867]  Fight or flight.
[00:11:38.488 --> 00:11:41.570]  And so it doesn't come across in my psyche as fear.
[00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:46.492]  It comes across as confidence, bravado, arrogance, hatred.
[00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:53.636]  Anger, viciousness, nastiness, and it's because I'm hurting inside.
[00:11:56.439 --> 00:12:00.863]  I have deep empathy, because any creature that doesn't have empathy is not an advanced creature.
[00:12:06.688 --> 00:12:12.934]  That's just a basic of being conscious and having any decency in your programming, that you have empathy.
[00:12:14.417 --> 00:12:16.458]  And we're losing our empathy around the world.
[00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:30.809]  I mean, I see headlines that are confirmed where they're ripping the livers and kidneys and corneas out of living patients in China and then keeping them alive till the next person lands in Japan from America or Europe.
[00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:34.711]  Then they go take out the last kidney and take the heart out and the liver.
[00:12:34.731 --> 00:12:36.392]  I mean, that's beyond...
[00:12:37.685 --> 00:12:45.629]  A science fiction movie like Coma in the 1970s that neighbor kids showed me that scared the daylights out of me when I was like five years old.
[00:12:52.392 --> 00:12:54.313]  This was sold to Transplant Tourist.
[00:12:54.353 --> 00:12:55.254]  That's the Daily Mail.
[00:12:56.034 --> 00:12:57.515]  And I already knew that.
[00:12:57.635 --> 00:13:00.096]  It's just, I'd tell people, and I'm not bragging.
[00:13:00.176 --> 00:13:00.817]  I already knew that.
[00:13:00.857 --> 00:13:03.338]  It was in the Falun Gong newspapers 15 years ago.
[00:13:03.358 --> 00:13:04.879]  The Epoch Times.
[00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.891]  But I've got all this world news to cover, tons of it.
[00:13:09.492 --> 00:13:23.821]  But at the end of the day, Obama wants us to get upset about a mentally ill pill head, who we now know is on a whole bunch of different drugs, prescription drugs, in his own words.
[00:13:24.322 --> 00:13:26.483]  I take so many pills, I just take five of each.
[00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:35.329]  I take antidepressants, I take antipsychotics like lithium, I live in my mother's basement.
[00:13:38.837 --> 00:13:41.418]  And the question is, why are we creating people like this?
[00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:51.244]  We need guns as individuals who've done nothing wrong to protect ourselves from lunatics like that, who always attack gun-free zones because they're cowards.
[00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:54.886]  I mean, if that son of a bitch came here, I'd blow his ass away.
[00:13:56.227 --> 00:13:57.988]  And I'm not trying to act like a tough guy.
[00:13:58.028 --> 00:13:59.809]  That's a normal response.
[00:14:03.871 --> 00:14:07.333]  They talk about grown men at the military facility.
[00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:18.653]  The VA Troop Education Center that was next door to the university and that they tried to get out and that security guards wouldn't let them.
[00:14:21.014 --> 00:14:24.495]  And I'm surprised they didn't just push them out of the way because these guys had guns.
[00:14:24.555 --> 00:14:26.315]  And I'm not saying, I'm not judging them.
[00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:31.617]  But you had vets inside, you know, charged and one guy got shot five times.
[00:14:33.537 --> 00:14:36.258]  I just wonder where we've gone as a society
[00:14:38.612 --> 00:14:40.934]  Did people just submit to all of this?
[00:14:41.334 --> 00:15:01.609]  My friend Mike Hanson, the story's on InfoWars.com, who was the second producer of my AXS TV show after Buckley, and who did camera work for me for about six, seven, eight years, and is in a lot of my documentaries, snuck into Bohemian Grove with me.
[00:15:03.407 --> 00:15:06.890]  Mike Hanson called me frantically a few days ago, but he didn't want to come on air yet.
[00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.271]  He said he was going to speak at the City Council.
[00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:15.077]  This is a guy with no criminal record, Army veteran, father of multiple children, married 40-something years, just a great guy.
[00:15:15.117 --> 00:15:23.143]  His dad was famously part of the people that tried to take out the tower shooter at UT.
[00:15:23.363 --> 00:15:26.386]  His brother is a senior police officer, highly decorated in Austin.
[00:15:26.866 --> 00:15:28.107]  Just, he's a really good guy.
[00:15:28.127 --> 00:15:30.949]  And he said, he called me last week,
[00:15:31.857 --> 00:15:32.598]  I talked about it on air.
[00:15:32.618 --> 00:15:34.639]  He just said there's SWAT teams everywhere.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.721]  They're SWAT teaming hundreds of houses.
[00:15:37.141 --> 00:15:38.422]  They don't have warrants.
[00:15:38.843 --> 00:15:40.544]  They have rubber stamp warrants.
[00:15:40.844 --> 00:15:42.326]  They federalized Gonzales.
[00:15:42.966 --> 00:15:50.292]  And this is a town where his German side of the family, the Wolves, the Wolves basically were early immigrants to.
[00:15:50.312 --> 00:15:53.135]  It's where the Texas Revolution started as well.
[00:15:55.016 --> 00:16:00.761]  And when his grandfather died, he moved down there and took over a hotel, a little hotel and a bunch of houses he owned.
[00:16:03.203 --> 00:16:07.788]  Kind of blue collar nouveau riche, hard working folks.
[00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.712]  And so it happens to his renters.
[00:16:11.812 --> 00:16:14.235]  It happens to people he sold houses to.
[00:16:14.295 --> 00:16:15.897]  It's happened to people he knows.
[00:16:17.219 --> 00:16:17.580]  I don't know.
[00:16:34.341 --> 00:16:38.725]  They are taking over towns all over the country, and Asset 4 for sure is seizing.
[00:16:39.485 --> 00:16:43.308]  And they are taking your town over, because that private property's got big oil and gas wells on it.
[00:16:43.689 --> 00:16:47.091]  That's the houses of SWAT team and folks that just got oil and gas money.
[00:16:47.112 --> 00:16:48.693]  And they're taking over.
[00:16:48.713 --> 00:16:49.533]  They're taking over everywhere.
[00:16:50.614 --> 00:16:57.180]  And he went to the City Council, spoke for three minutes, was finishing his statement, and the police chief arrested him.
[00:16:58.928 --> 00:17:18.603]  And then he doesn't resist them, and they charged him, I just talked to the family this morning, called his cell phone, and talked to multiple members of his family, and he has now been charged with disrupting a public meeting or procession and resisting arrest, which could be a felony.
[00:17:19.083 --> 00:17:24.107]  They haven't gotten it yet from the judge, and now he's being held, and they're saying he won't bond out.
[00:17:24.147 --> 00:17:24.748]  Well, I know why.
[00:17:25.088 --> 00:17:27.390]  They're probably giving him a personal recognizance bond.
[00:17:28.527 --> 00:17:31.289]  That basically agrees that he's done these things.
[00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.672]  That's how those read in most counties and cities now.
[00:17:34.992 --> 00:17:35.973]  Things are so fraudulent.
[00:17:37.134 --> 00:17:39.516]  But there's all these big global stories.
[00:17:39.576 --> 00:17:40.617]  It's just, there's an example.
[00:17:40.937 --> 00:17:52.627]  Someone I know is in a town where, and this is a pretty big town now, where he says no matter where he drives, there are armored trailers and people with black uniforms raiding houses.
[00:17:54.622 --> 00:18:05.351]  It's basically a roundup, and this is how they do it, town by town by town, and they do it with the drug war, when the government, the big banks that run the government, are shipping the drugs in on record.
[00:18:05.431 --> 00:18:13.978]  I mean, they had congressional hearings in the 60s, the 70s, and in 1997, with the CIA Inspector General admitting it.
[00:18:15.299 --> 00:18:16.980]  But I don't need to hear it from them.
[00:18:18.602 --> 00:18:23.446]  I've interviewed Terry Reid, and I've interviewed the famous CIA pilots.
[00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:27.040]  And it goes beyond that.
[00:18:31.125 --> 00:18:34.068]  I've had family, personally, that told me about it.
[00:18:35.009 --> 00:18:36.011]  And I'm not going to go any further.
[00:18:37.284 --> 00:18:40.206]  I don't even want to know this stuff because I already know it all, you know.
[00:18:40.526 --> 00:18:41.487]  It's all dangerous.
[00:18:41.547 --> 00:18:42.328]  It's all bad.
[00:18:42.388 --> 00:18:43.048]  It's all evil.
[00:18:43.769 --> 00:18:45.770]  And of course, they don't just stop with the drug dealing.
[00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.852]  They run the kids now, the snuff films.
[00:18:49.513 --> 00:18:52.815]  And the argument is, well, we run it so we control it and keep control of it.
[00:18:52.915 --> 00:18:53.215]  Bull!
[00:18:53.475 --> 00:18:54.776]  You're growing the crime.
[00:18:55.277 --> 00:18:56.978]  You're growing the culture of corruption.
[00:18:58.524 --> 00:19:03.087]  You're growing the whole stinking thing until the entire culture implodes.
[00:19:03.447 --> 00:19:06.729]  And they say because he kept speaking, that's resisting.
[00:19:07.169 --> 00:19:08.871]  He resisted them in no way.
[00:19:08.891 --> 00:19:16.415]  But it becomes this fetish that, oh, you resisted the police, so now we're going to charge you.
[00:19:16.675 --> 00:19:21.138]  And that's how the police dishonor themselves, is by false charges.
[00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:25.101]  And just throwing charges on people to punish them.
[00:19:25.481 --> 00:19:26.602]  You're not going to punish Mike.
[00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:40.941]  Now he's going to end up putting all his money and energy into running for City Council, and he's going to come after all of you politically, and you've only made it 50 times worse.
[00:19:41.982 --> 00:19:45.064]  And that's where tyrants miscalculate throughout history.
[00:19:45.384 --> 00:19:46.005]  When we come back...
[00:19:47.008 --> 00:19:59.052]  We're going to get into the masses of important news, obviously, on the election front, on France's president saying Muslim rift threatens total war, and that Europe's at total war.
[00:19:59.372 --> 00:20:03.374]  So his answer is bring in unlimited Islamic radicals and then capitulate to them.
[00:20:03.414 --> 00:20:04.094]  That's his answer.
[00:20:05.334 --> 00:20:09.896]  Supporters introduce Hillary in Iowa by declaring who cares about email and Benghazi scandals and more.
[00:20:11.152 --> 00:20:15.394]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[00:20:15.574 --> 00:20:19.476]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:26.819]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[00:20:26.999 --> 00:20:32.041]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[00:20:32.241 --> 00:20:40.185]  If you want to boost your omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[00:21:10.948 --> 00:21:14.452]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:21:15.193 --> 00:21:15.693]  It's true.
[00:21:15.813 --> 00:21:19.757]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:21:19.978 --> 00:21:21.820]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.845]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[00:21:27.145 --> 00:21:39.763]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[00:22:01.505 --> 00:22:02.566]  For the love of clean water.
[00:22:10.652 --> 00:22:16.973]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[00:22:17.353 --> 00:22:22.314]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[00:22:22.854 --> 00:22:26.835]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about.
[00:22:27.375 --> 00:22:31.236]  This change has deep implications for life in America.
[00:22:31.676 --> 00:22:35.917]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit and the family you want to protect,
[00:22:36.517 --> 00:22:39.260]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.862]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[00:22:42.602 --> 00:22:46.526]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[00:22:47.006 --> 00:22:47.507]  They did.
[00:22:48.107 --> 00:22:52.531]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[00:22:53.172 --> 00:22:53.632]  They did.
[00:22:53.652 --> 00:22:57.615]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:22:58.176 --> 00:23:00.178]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:23:00.538 --> 00:23:01.719]  This will affect us all.
[00:23:02.059 --> 00:23:04.081]  You can watch the video for free right now

[00:23:51.442 --> 00:23:51.702]  I think so.
[00:24:18.871 --> 00:24:21.032]  Pancho needs your prayers, it's true.
[00:24:22.092 --> 00:24:23.633]  Save a few for Lefty 2.
[00:24:25.073 --> 00:24:26.914]  He only did what he had to do.
[00:24:26.974 --> 00:24:27.854]  Now he's grown old.
[00:24:35.436 --> 00:24:45.780]  Livin' on the road, my friend Was gonna keep you free and clean And now you wear your skin like iron
[00:24:47.291 --> 00:24:51.795]  Weren't your mama's only boy?
[00:24:51.815 --> 00:24:59.661]  But her favorite one, it seemed.
[00:24:59.681 --> 00:25:07.568]  Goodbye.
[00:25:08.729 --> 00:25:11.791]  I don't think Willie Nelson has the completely magic voice anymore.
[00:25:11.991 --> 00:25:14.133]  My God, when he had it.
[00:25:14.173 --> 00:25:14.834]  A voice like it.
[00:25:17.146 --> 00:25:21.390]  Still plays about 300 takes a year though, it sounds great.
[00:25:23.273 --> 00:25:25.034]  For the honest world to feel.
[00:25:27.938 --> 00:25:29.459]  Poncho met his match, you know.
[00:25:30.587 --> 00:25:34.291]  On the deserts.
[00:25:34.411 --> 00:25:35.392]  That's the way it goes.
[00:25:36.353 --> 00:25:40.718]  You know, I think we really can't play this type of music because I just can't turn it off.
[00:25:41.479 --> 00:25:42.640]  Oh, but that's the way it goes.
[00:25:43.441 --> 00:25:45.703]  Let me do this.
[00:25:45.844 --> 00:25:46.985]  I'm going to discipline myself.
[00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:48.306]  I told Drudge last night.
[00:25:49.307 --> 00:26:03.469]  That the main thing I'm mad at myself about, that as the years go on, I get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse about covering the wide spectrum of news and just giving a brief, nice little snippet of context to it.
[00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:13.912]  And it is because I tend to already have looked at it all and read over it, and then when I come back, it's a second or third look, and then it's not fresh and dynamic.
[00:26:14.292 --> 00:26:21.513]  And we couldn't decide, talking about it with he and one of his editors, a really nice fellow as well, really smart fellow, how you do that.
[00:26:21.533 --> 00:26:29.875]  And they were agreeing that it's interesting how that first look, that first thought is the most incisive and the most decisive.
[00:26:30.993 --> 00:26:40.836]  And then it's hard to then regurgitate it back up because we're not scripting this, it's the opposite of a teleprompter polished transmission.
[00:26:41.457 --> 00:26:47.799]  That's what talk radio is that we've now brought to television 14, 15 years ago.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:27:00.263]  So when I start the next segment, I'm going to really try to be focused and disciplined for 18 minutes and plunge into the news and cover it all.
[00:27:01.391 --> 00:27:02.072]  And there's a lot of it.
[00:27:02.132 --> 00:27:05.735]  France's president says Muslim rift threatens total war.
[00:27:06.696 --> 00:27:11.320]  Supporters introduce Hillary in Iowa by declaring who cares about Benghazi scandals.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.621]  We've got that video.
[00:27:13.582 --> 00:27:16.444]  Matt Drudge challenges Obama, give up your guns.
[00:27:18.046 --> 00:27:20.288]  That's a story I want to red link and put at the top.
[00:27:21.243 --> 00:27:23.705]  Because that's probably what we should have put out first yesterday.
[00:27:23.725 --> 00:27:26.427]  Everybody did a great job, but that's really the biggest news.
[00:27:26.647 --> 00:27:30.090]  We need to start a meme, and start hammering, and start pushing.
[00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:31.711]  Obama, turn in your guns.
[00:27:31.851 --> 00:27:32.932]  Obama, turn in your guns.
[00:27:33.252 --> 00:27:34.253]  Hillary, turn in your guns.
[00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:38.876]  Paul, when I talked to him, was jogging in the hills outside London.
[00:27:39.757 --> 00:27:43.040]  But when he gets back, we're going to start a hashtag, we're going to start a meme.
[00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:52.319]  Attaching it to this Drudge article, and we're going to red link it on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and on Facebook and Twitter and everywhere else.
[00:27:52.579 --> 00:27:53.680]  Hopefully Drudge will link to it.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:28:00.143]  He's already got like four links to us today, but this is really important to push and drive this to the top.
[00:28:00.623 --> 00:28:07.886]  And speaking of that, the number three trend on Facebook right now is Matt Drudge on the show yesterday.
[00:28:07.946 --> 00:28:09.647]  I think we have a screenshot of that.
[00:28:10.007 --> 00:28:11.448]  Matt Drudge, political commentator.
[00:28:12.088 --> 00:28:14.772]  Criticizes Democratic leaders in interview with Alex Jones.
[00:28:15.914 --> 00:28:20.080]  And that's just one article that's trending third.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.643]  There's a bunch of other articles in the top 20 or so.
[00:28:23.284 --> 00:28:26.629]  Same thing, it's trending towards number one on Google when I looked this morning.
[00:28:27.698 --> 00:28:29.279]  Uh, but I've caught Google over the years now.
[00:28:29.299 --> 00:28:31.199]  When we've got something going to the top, they just remove it.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.880]  Facebook does that as well.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.121]  And Drudge would say, well, why are you then on their platform giving them power?
[00:28:36.761 --> 00:28:44.404]  I agree the average person would do better with their photo blog or their poetry or whatever, creating their own website and promoting it.
[00:28:46.806 --> 00:28:50.349]  You promote it on the enemy channels and then you drive them to yourself.
[00:28:50.949 --> 00:28:53.651]  I understand that Matt did it before anything existed.
[00:28:54.272 --> 00:28:58.455]  So it's kind of easy when you're there at the beginning of the internet proliferating.
[00:28:58.875 --> 00:28:59.876]  Of course, I'm not saying it's easy.
[00:28:59.916 --> 00:29:01.697]  It's super hard to be that person that does it.
[00:29:02.498 --> 00:29:06.601]  It's just that it's kind of like almost giving Promethean fire.
[00:29:08.362 --> 00:29:12.946]  So he's there giving Promethean fire so he can say, oh, I don't need anybody.
[00:29:13.046 --> 00:29:13.686]  And I understand that.
[00:29:14.226 --> 00:29:15.607]  That's why Drudge is so special.
[00:29:16.528 --> 00:29:21.031]  I'm not just saying that because he's the number one news political site in the world.
[00:29:21.291 --> 00:29:26.735]  That's admitted even by the New York Times that it gets more traffic than all the big sites combined.
[00:29:28.236 --> 00:29:31.158]  It's just that I don't know if I'd disagree with him.
[00:29:31.238 --> 00:29:34.100]  It's just a different kind of spin on it that
[00:29:35.419 --> 00:29:39.323]  Yes, we've gotten to a point where we don't need Facebook or Twitter or YouTube.
[00:29:40.204 --> 00:29:51.235]  But, if I can go on Facebook and talk to 100,000 people at once with a video, and then that goes viral everywhere else, I'm using the enemy weapons that I've basically captured.
[00:29:51.936 --> 00:29:56.421]  And I will use their munitions against them to blow up their operations politically.
[00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:57.442]  And that's what I do.
[00:29:57.502 --> 00:29:58.283]  It's just weapons to me.
[00:29:59.676 --> 00:30:02.683]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.626 --> 00:30:06.292]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.167 --> 00:30:15.490]  Matt Drudge challenges Barack Obama to give up his guns.
[00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:22.094]  The news icon calls on the President and Hillary Clinton to relinquish their Secret Service protection.
[00:30:22.334 --> 00:30:23.495]  I challenge Hillary.
[00:30:23.755 --> 00:30:25.296]  Take away your Secret Service.
[00:30:25.556 --> 00:30:26.477]  Take it away now.
[00:30:26.597 --> 00:30:27.878]  Have no security around you.
[00:30:28.178 --> 00:30:29.639]  Have no guns around you, Hillary.
[00:30:29.959 --> 00:30:30.680]  I dare you.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:31.380]  I dare you.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.701]  Obama, same thing.
[00:30:32.941 --> 00:30:34.202]  Drop your guns, Obama.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.903]  Take your secret service away, Obama.
[00:30:37.063 --> 00:30:38.184]  Take it all away.
[00:30:38.365 --> 00:30:40.247]  Leave the White House unguarded, Obama.
[00:30:40.367 --> 00:30:43.392]  Let everybody know there's no guns on the White House grounds, Obama.
[00:30:43.532 --> 00:30:44.914]  You know what would happen in 30 seconds?
[00:30:45.214 --> 00:30:47.257]  Both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth.
[00:30:47.938 --> 00:30:48.659]  So they're asking us!
[00:30:49.781 --> 00:30:54.807]  To drop our guns and to drop our security measures or, or what?
[00:30:55.307 --> 00:31:01.294]  So this thing is very real and I don't see how it's being taken seriously except for the sick voter.
[00:31:01.675 --> 00:31:05.719]  That was yesterday during a surprise appearance on the Alex Jones Show.

[00:31:57.841 --> 00:31:58.722]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:31:58.742 --> 00:31:59.663]  It doesn't have garbage in it.

[00:33:07.104 --> 00:33:08.244]  Another world.
[00:33:08.264 --> 00:33:09.165]  Another time.
[00:33:09.305 --> 00:33:12.326]  In the age of wonder.
[00:33:35.823 --> 00:33:44.405]  During the break, we came up with some different hashtags that we're going to send out attached to the article that's red-linked on InfoWars.com.
[00:33:44.465 --> 00:33:48.447]  Matt Drudge challenges Obama, give up your guns.
[00:34:06.553 --> 00:34:10.617]  And we're going to add the hashtag, Seize Obama's Guns.
[00:34:12.058 --> 00:34:14.020]  Hashtag, Seize Obama's Guns.
[00:34:16.903 --> 00:34:20.946]  Hashtag, we're also going to be putting out, Obama Drop Your Guns.
[00:34:22.136 --> 00:34:25.197]  And then, Richard, I didn't tell you I was going to put you on air, see if you can get to a mic.
[00:34:25.997 --> 00:34:31.179]  You came up with a really good one that I simultaneously, or just before, had come up with as well, but forgot to tell Lewis.
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.600]  What was the one you came up with that was real simple?
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.801]  Hashtag Disarm Obama.
[00:34:36.041 --> 00:34:36.421]  That's it.
[00:34:36.521 --> 00:34:37.902]  Hashtag Disarm Obama.
[00:34:38.772 --> 00:34:47.120]  So, hashtag DisarmObama, hashtag ObamaDropYourGuns is another one, and hashtag ConfiscateObama'sGuns.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:53.185]  And you can also say ConfiscateHillary'sGuns, or NoSecretServiceObama.
[00:34:53.445 --> 00:34:58.310]  I mean, we're going to put it out at our little Twitter account.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.341]  And it's little because we came to it late and don't buy millions of fake.
[00:35:04.362 --> 00:35:05.862]  You can buy a million for like $5,000.
[00:35:05.902 --> 00:35:13.305]  You can be like Hillary and, you know, buy yourself 40 million of them or the First Lady and buy yourself, you know, 20 million or whatever she's got.
[00:35:13.345 --> 00:35:14.666]  And it's admitted they're almost all fake.
[00:35:16.596 --> 00:35:18.217]  They had big third-party groups go and look at them.
[00:35:18.597 --> 00:35:19.778]  I mean, I just won't do that.
[00:35:20.379 --> 00:35:23.120]  See, we have millions of Facebook likes.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:23.901]  Those are real people.
[00:35:23.921 --> 00:35:25.742]  And then they put some algorithm in.
[00:35:25.782 --> 00:35:30.825]  As soon as we were racing up like a hundred thousand a month a few years ago, they just, boom, stopped us dead in our tracks.
[00:35:31.146 --> 00:35:32.186]  Don't let us share our stuff.
[00:35:33.747 --> 00:35:37.570]  And I understand that's part of their money-making program, but still, we are there.
[00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:38.711]  They're using us.
[00:35:38.871 --> 00:35:39.651]  We're using them.
[00:35:41.432 --> 00:35:43.514]  It's not symbiotic, I will tell you.
[00:35:44.855 --> 00:35:54.103]  But the relationship I have with Drudge is symbiotic in that we want freedom, we want liberty, and so we cross-promote because we're basically in the same boat, not wanting to go under total tyranny.
[00:35:55.704 --> 00:36:05.433]  Now, I said I'm going to go through a bunch of news, but what I want to do first, obviously, is get into the Matt Drudge interview and play some of these clips from yesterday because these are so incredibly important.
[00:36:08.635 --> 00:36:11.077]  There are hundreds of articles out today
[00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:14.757]  And I don't normally cover Infowars when we're in the news.
[00:36:14.817 --> 00:36:16.418]  It's normally just some mindless attack piece.
[00:36:17.018 --> 00:36:26.722]  But if you study this piece and you listen to what Drudge has to say, it really shows you how the media tries to spin things and how ridiculous they sound trying to criticize Matt Drudge.
[00:36:27.463 --> 00:36:33.665]  Because he's saying things that people across the political spectrum in major polls show they wholeheartedly agree with.
[00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:34.966]  It's ridiculous!
[00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:46.198]  Matt Drudge says when you're starving in the winter and you finally get to a cabin with hot soup and chips, or hot soup and, you know, bread, it tastes great.
[00:36:46.699 --> 00:36:47.620]  Or it's refreshing.
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:56.747]  Or if you're in the desert, Matt Drudge says, if you've been marching for a day without water, a big giant glass of ice water isn't delicious.
[00:36:56.887 --> 00:36:57.668]  Isn't he a kook?
[00:36:57.748 --> 00:36:58.969]  Isn't he a conspiracy theorist?
[00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:01.971]  Matt Drudge is crazy.
[00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:05.674]  He says the ocean is blue and that ships sail on the seas.
[00:37:05.774 --> 00:37:10.017]  I mean, it's an attempt to say you're not allowed to have user opinions.
[00:37:10.318 --> 00:37:11.499]  You're not allowed to speak out.
[00:37:11.819 --> 00:37:13.000]  We're the controlled media.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.421]  We control reality.
[00:37:14.741 --> 00:37:15.562]  Only listen to us.
[00:37:16.923 --> 00:37:28.172]  I personally, this morning, if you just type in Matt Drudge conspiracy, Matt Drudge conspiracy theorist, there are scores of articles saying Matt Drudge gives bizarre interview with Looney, with conspiracy theorist.
[00:37:30.154 --> 00:37:30.414]  Just
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.302]  Intending to, again, make people not listen to what he actually said.
[00:37:36.602 --> 00:37:37.962]  There's the headline of the Huffington Post.
[00:37:38.422 --> 00:37:43.944]  Matt Grudge gives a rare and really, really weird interview to a conspiracy theorist.
[00:37:45.645 --> 00:37:46.485]  What does that mean?
[00:37:47.605 --> 00:37:49.166]  It means we control reality.
[00:37:49.446 --> 00:37:50.726]  Disregard, disregard.
[00:37:51.047 --> 00:37:52.447]  We're going to ridicule people.
[00:37:52.667 --> 00:37:54.268]  And we're back in junior high now.
[00:37:54.608 --> 00:37:56.869]  So don't actually listen to what they have to say.
[00:37:56.929 --> 00:37:58.749]  Don't actually... No.
[00:37:59.049 --> 00:38:00.150]  Just sit back and feel
[00:38:01.141 --> 00:38:01.581]  Powerful.
[00:38:03.002 --> 00:38:03.542]  Here's another one.
[00:38:03.842 --> 00:38:04.362]  Salon.
[00:38:04.402 --> 00:38:09.105]  The folks that have written, what, five articles basically promoting pedophilia in the last few years?
[00:38:13.186 --> 00:38:24.831]  Hilariously paranoid Matt Drudge appears on conspiracy monger Alex Jones Show to slag Salon and demand locations of Hillary's lovers.
[00:38:25.412 --> 00:38:30.394]  You know, that might be the most sensational and dangerous thing that Matt Drudge did on the show yesterday.
[00:38:31.772 --> 00:38:33.313]  I'm not judging you, lady.
[00:38:33.333 --> 00:38:33.413]  Okay?
[00:38:53.567 --> 00:38:56.970]  I mean, you know the old joke that I'm a lesbian trapped in a man's body.
[00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:58.271]  I understand.
[00:38:58.351 --> 00:39:02.715]  But if we're getting honest here, you don't want folks to know about that.
[00:39:03.095 --> 00:39:04.736]  So let's see your girlfriends.
[00:39:04.997 --> 00:39:05.637]  Let's roll them out.
[00:39:05.677 --> 00:39:06.358]  We know who they are.
[00:39:07.839 --> 00:39:09.460]  You guys can't keep your hands off each other.
[00:39:10.822 --> 00:39:12.783]  So roll it out.
[00:39:13.244 --> 00:39:14.084]  Roll it out right now.
[00:39:14.164 --> 00:39:14.765]  Let's see it.
[00:39:14.805 --> 00:39:15.325]  Let's see it.
[00:39:15.385 --> 00:39:15.886]  Let's see it.
[00:39:15.926 --> 00:39:16.406]  Let's see it.
[00:39:16.466 --> 00:39:16.947]  Let's see it.
[00:39:19.571 --> 00:39:21.412]  That's the kind of stuff they come after you for.
[00:39:21.552 --> 00:39:24.213]  So, the Drudge interview, number one, was about courage.
[00:39:24.954 --> 00:39:31.857]  And you know, I'm sitting here about to say all this, I don't even want to say it because it sounds... grovelly.
[00:39:32.077 --> 00:39:38.820]  You know, it sounds like I'm just laying on and buttering Drudge up, but look, if it's no brag, it's just fact.
[00:39:40.201 --> 00:39:41.822]  If it is what it is, you gotta say it.
[00:39:43.536 --> 00:39:51.892]  I don't like saying somebody like Putin is making America look like idiots and making President Obama look like a complete moron, but it's true, so I say it.
[00:39:52.754 --> 00:39:54.457]  But again, Obama's there to make sure that happens.
[00:39:55.856 --> 00:40:17.815]  I can pridefully say that Matt Drudge is a super classy person, has amazing courage, and understands trying to build up other people in the fight for liberty, and he wants to build up alternative media, independent media, that's why he promotes people's YouTube channels, it's why he links to little guys and little gals, because he instinctively knows the power is in we the people.
[00:40:17.875 --> 00:40:21.939]  He's a real populist, a real libertarian, a real trailblazer, and super smart.
[00:40:23.211 --> 00:40:27.934]  And so that's why they demonize him and lie about him and attack him, but still they can't bring him down.
[00:40:28.134 --> 00:40:30.996]  And the stuff he was telling me, he said some of it on air.
[00:40:32.878 --> 00:40:37.241]  But how a Supreme Court Justice, he told me the whole story, name everything.
[00:40:37.541 --> 00:40:38.602]  I can't obviously repeat that.
[00:40:38.642 --> 00:40:40.323]  He didn't say don't repeat it, but I'm not going to repeat it.
[00:40:43.496 --> 00:40:54.905]  How he was told point blank, no, they're moving in the next two years, this was recently, to vote to end the internet freedom and to ban libertarian and conservative talk radio, internet, everything.
[00:40:54.925 --> 00:41:00.389]  I mean, they're going to, this is the plan, the other justices are bragging, they're ready, it's a takeover.
[00:41:02.611 --> 00:41:08.736]  And really, that's why Drudge came here was just to discuss the fact that
[00:41:11.624 --> 00:41:13.405]  It's like Nazi Germany's invading Europe.
[00:41:13.465 --> 00:41:15.907]  I mean, this is a takedown of freedom.
[00:41:15.987 --> 00:41:17.808]  All over the world they're arresting people for their speech.
[00:41:18.369 --> 00:41:22.712]  Our media won't criticize China now for keeping people alive while they harvest their organs.
[00:41:25.293 --> 00:41:31.738]  I mean, they cut people's corneas off, they take their kidney, then they make them wait a month, sometimes longer, then they harvest the rest.
[00:41:32.038 --> 00:41:33.439]  That's not even news anymore.
[00:41:34.379 --> 00:41:36.001]  And we're doing the same stuff to babies here.
[00:41:36.823 --> 00:41:41.847]  And they just sit there and laugh and go, oh, conspiracy theorist at Planned Parenthood, when it's all admitted.
[00:41:42.007 --> 00:41:43.148]  That's the only words you've got!
[00:41:43.168 --> 00:41:46.150]  It's just a conspiracy theory.
[00:41:50.013 --> 00:41:52.274]  And these are peaceful, religious prisoners.
[00:41:52.734 --> 00:41:53.535]  Falun Gong.
[00:41:53.715 --> 00:41:58.098]  They love them because they don't drink, they don't use drugs, they have super healthy systems.
[00:41:59.099 --> 00:42:00.640]  They don't have a high rejection rate.
[00:42:02.221 --> 00:42:05.644]  They have, quote, fresh, as the Chinese government advertised a decade ago,
[00:42:07.205 --> 00:42:07.545]  Organs!
[00:42:09.766 --> 00:42:11.127]  So here's some of the clips I want to play.
[00:42:11.507 --> 00:42:14.288]  Hollywood no longer inspires or challenges us.
[00:42:15.788 --> 00:42:18.650]  Despite crazy reality, Matt Drudge has faith in humanity.
[00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:24.472]  Matt Drudge attacks the deliberate repression of humanity.
[00:42:24.532 --> 00:42:25.992]  Matt Drudge warns the end of the internet.
[00:42:26.032 --> 00:42:26.533]  That's huge.
[00:42:27.753 --> 00:42:29.934]  We have another report, Why Matt Drudge is More Relevant Than Ever.
[00:42:30.034 --> 00:42:34.856]  It's a bunch of really key clips, but I want to first play this clip where he talks about Obama
[00:42:38.717 --> 00:42:39.817]  Drop your guns!
[00:42:40.057 --> 00:42:41.177]  Turn in your guns!
[00:42:47.459 --> 00:42:48.359]  That is so important.
[00:42:48.379 --> 00:42:50.559]  That video is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:42:50.879 --> 00:42:52.180]  Matt Drudge challenges Obama.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:53.860]  Give up your guns.
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.941]  Give up your Secret Service.
[00:42:57.581 --> 00:43:03.862]  And of course, that's obviously asinine, but they turn whole cities into martial law for the Pope or Obama or
[00:43:04.904 --> 00:43:12.853]  Other top New World Order people, but then they tell you, you can't have a gun in Chicago to protect yourself from criminals that don't even follow the laws.
[00:43:14.375 --> 00:43:15.096]  So here's that clip.
[00:43:16.837 --> 00:43:18.439]  There's so much going on in the world.
[00:43:18.819 --> 00:43:21.702]  Obama now is talking about, well, Australia had a good plan.
[00:43:21.722 --> 00:43:22.502]  We may have to do that.
[00:43:22.943 --> 00:43:24.825]  That's clearly talking about gun confiscation.
[00:43:25.245 --> 00:43:26.366]  Now Hillary's doing it.
[00:43:26.726 --> 00:43:29.189]  CNN has pundits saying, let's just take them.
[00:43:29.669 --> 00:43:32.872]  Do these people realize that this is the line in the sand at the Alamo?
[00:43:33.272 --> 00:43:38.317]  If they really come out in a frontal assault on guns, it means I think they're trying to start a civil war.
[00:43:39.395 --> 00:43:40.677]  It just seems like insanity.
[00:43:40.717 --> 00:43:44.101]  I mean, they may think that they're Stalin or something.
[00:43:44.522 --> 00:43:50.309]  Well, because they're all armed themselves, or they all have that security around them themselves.
[00:43:50.589 --> 00:43:52.372]  They don't have to worry about it.
[00:43:52.392 --> 00:43:55.235]  I challenge Hillary, take away your Secret Service.
[00:43:55.996 --> 00:43:56.937]  Take it away now.
[00:43:57.758 --> 00:43:59.299]  Take away your Secret Service.
[00:43:59.339 --> 00:44:00.140]  Dismiss them.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:01.981]  Have no security around you.
[00:44:02.261 --> 00:44:03.703]  Have no guns around you, Hillary.
[00:44:04.023 --> 00:44:04.804]  I dare you.
[00:44:05.384 --> 00:44:05.924]  I dare you.
[00:44:06.265 --> 00:44:07.226]  Obama, same thing.
[00:44:07.826 --> 00:44:09.147]  Drop your guns, Obama.
[00:44:09.868 --> 00:44:11.809]  Take your Secret Service away, Obama.
[00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:13.851]  Take it all away.
[00:44:14.011 --> 00:44:15.893]  Leave the White House unguarded, Obama.
[00:44:16.273 --> 00:44:19.256]  Let everybody know there's no guns on the White House grounds, Obama.
[00:44:19.276 --> 00:44:21.197]  You know what would happen in 30 seconds?
[00:44:22.138 --> 00:44:24.100]  Both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth.
[00:44:25.004 --> 00:44:31.909]  So they're asking us to drop our guns and to drop our security measures or what?
[00:44:32.389 --> 00:44:38.374]  So this thing is very real, and I don't see how it's being taken seriously except for the sick voter.
[00:44:39.054 --> 00:44:41.816]  You can't underestimate the sickness of the American people right now.
[00:44:42.036 --> 00:44:42.717]  They're really sick.
[00:44:43.477 --> 00:44:47.921]  And that's to me, I'm more angry at the sick Americans than I am at Obama or Hillary.
[00:44:48.161 --> 00:44:49.702]  I'm really angry at the sick Americans.
[00:44:52.204 --> 00:44:52.624]  That's right.
[00:44:54.008 --> 00:45:01.750]  And when you're sick, when you're drinking a fifth of vodka every day and you have liver failure that's imminent, you need your family there to intervene and say you're sick, you're killing yourself.
[00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:03.430]  You need to admit that's happening.
[00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:19.894]  And when you are letting the government engage in every criminal activity, selling us out to foreign banks, banker bailouts, 0% interest rates for the elite but high interest for the people, the government legalizing payday loans, loan sharking, I mean, the crimes go on and on forever.
[00:45:19.914 --> 00:45:21.574]  The drug money laundering,
[00:45:23.424 --> 00:45:24.345]  By the central government?
[00:45:26.647 --> 00:45:29.589]  The list stretches from here to eternity.
[00:45:31.611 --> 00:45:34.073]  From here, past infinity, and back again.
[00:45:37.416 --> 00:45:38.337]  It's just perpetual.
[00:45:38.917 --> 00:45:39.578]  And it's rotting.
[00:45:40.879 --> 00:45:44.500]  Now I want to go to this next clip where he warns of the end of internet freedom as we know it.
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:46.860]  And this is being done now in Germany.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.441]  This is being done in France.
[00:45:48.461 --> 00:45:49.821]  This is being done in Sweden.
[00:45:50.201 --> 00:45:51.522]  This is being done in China.
[00:45:51.762 --> 00:45:53.162]  This is beginning in Australia.
[00:45:53.522 --> 00:45:54.722]  This is starting in Canada.
[00:45:54.962 --> 00:45:56.043]  It's now coming here.
[00:45:56.083 --> 00:46:01.744]  It's the exact same formulae that other countries are three, four, five, six years ahead of us on.
[00:46:03.544 --> 00:46:05.305]  But now things are compressed.
[00:46:05.645 --> 00:46:10.306]  So what was happening six years ago in Germany is now going to be happening here in a year.
[00:46:14.588 --> 00:46:18.111]  Germany... I mean, I see these headlines out of mainline German newspapers.
[00:46:18.972 --> 00:46:21.013]  Do not criticize the immigrants in any way.
[00:46:21.313 --> 00:46:22.514]  Do not criticize the government.
[00:46:22.775 --> 00:46:26.938]  Do not demonstrate against open borders or you will be arrested and your children will be taken.
[00:46:27.338 --> 00:46:34.464]  And folks, Germany for a decade, from even wealthy, top families, folks that are worth, you know, 20, 30 million euros.
[00:46:35.805 --> 00:46:37.506]  I've seen the cases we've had the families on.
[00:46:37.766 --> 00:46:41.850]  I mean, folks that own companies, people that are like, you look at these families, they look like something off a postcard.
[00:46:43.254 --> 00:46:44.455]  And they homeschool their children?
[00:46:44.815 --> 00:46:45.655]  They take them!
[00:46:49.377 --> 00:46:55.939]  Germany never got out from under Hitler because one evil ended, the Soviets came in and took one half, the U.S.
[00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:58.820]  came in with NATO and took over the other half.
[00:46:59.841 --> 00:47:01.361]  And Germany never became free.
[00:47:01.542 --> 00:47:04.583]  They were both laboratory experiments of what's a better form of tyranny.
[00:47:04.963 --> 00:47:07.204]  Where you think you're free, or where you live in East Germany.
[00:47:07.984 --> 00:47:12.146]  And they've now merged the two systems and have reactivated the Stasi.
[00:47:13.871 --> 00:47:24.919]  I remember a couple weeks ago we reported on them hiring top Stasi people to work at Facebook to then report people, but then the German news a week later said, oh, they're actually hiring former Stasi to run the anti-free speech groups.
[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:28.761]  I mean, man, this is, like, scary!
[00:47:31.843 --> 00:47:32.504]  And they're doing it!
[00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:35.759]  They've had a whole bunch of senators, we've covered it.
[00:47:36.299 --> 00:47:40.443]  They've had the FCC come out and say, you know, we're looking at shutting down the Drudge Report.
[00:47:40.743 --> 00:47:42.665]  People go, good, who needs that big site?
[00:47:43.065 --> 00:47:43.326]  I don't.
[00:47:43.706 --> 00:47:44.667]  That's not my site.
[00:47:45.307 --> 00:47:48.390]  If they can take down Drudge, they can take anybody down.
[00:47:48.891 --> 00:47:51.113]  And that's one thing they've got in this class envy thing is
[00:47:51.673 --> 00:47:55.737]  You know, Rush Limbaugh has attacked me some over the years, and he's covered some of our news over the years as well.
[00:47:55.837 --> 00:47:56.918]  I'm not in competition with him.
[00:47:57.238 --> 00:47:58.959]  I was ordered to have this show up against him.
[00:47:58.979 --> 00:48:02.502]  Because they don't tell me what to say, but they told me what slot 18 years ago.
[00:48:02.542 --> 00:48:04.484]  They said, no, you're not going to be on at night anymore.
[00:48:04.804 --> 00:48:06.666]  You're going to go up against Rush Limbaugh and nobody else will.
[00:48:06.906 --> 00:48:07.907]  It was actually a great strategy.
[00:48:09.228 --> 00:48:12.651]  Because a lot of stations either couldn't get the show or didn't want to carry it, so we've been successful.
[00:48:13.392 --> 00:48:16.835]  So I don't have some score to settle with Limbaugh.
[00:48:16.855 --> 00:48:19.237]  I don't have that primitive thing where I want to knock off the big guy.
[00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:25.473]  I want to influence him to become more like me, which I've done.
[00:48:25.874 --> 00:48:26.414]  And I know I have.
[00:48:27.455 --> 00:48:28.556]  That's our biggest victory.
[00:48:28.576 --> 00:48:30.898]  We have influenced conservatism, talk radio.
[00:48:31.359 --> 00:48:32.920]  Obama in speeches talks about it.
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:35.282]  By name they talk about it on MSNBC every week.
[00:48:35.522 --> 00:48:38.205]  They say, GOP, stop becoming Alex Jones.
[00:48:38.545 --> 00:48:40.006]  Stop echoing his talking points.
[00:48:40.247 --> 00:48:42.789]  It's not talking points when I link to a UN document.
[00:48:44.175 --> 00:48:44.735]  They hate that.
[00:48:45.296 --> 00:48:47.557]  And it's dangerous that I'm one of the few people that gets it.
[00:48:47.977 --> 00:48:51.038]  I'm trying to get more people out there so I'm safe.
[00:48:51.058 --> 00:48:51.799]  Do you understand that?
[00:48:52.279 --> 00:48:57.261]  This isn't like some territorial club where I've got all the answers and I'm the big kingpin.
[00:48:57.461 --> 00:49:01.383]  And that's why Drudge is so sickeningly refreshing.
[00:49:03.444 --> 00:49:12.649]  I mean, it's sickening how much I like Matt Drudge because it's so refreshing somebody that gets it all, understands it, and is a fellow traveler, to use the communist term, but in a libertarian way.
[00:49:15.373 --> 00:49:20.155]  I mean, I have to be honest and say, Matt Drudge is the coolest person I've ever known.
[00:49:20.755 --> 00:49:28.958]  I mean, it's undoubtedly, hands down, he's helped us more, he's helped the country more, he's done so much good, it's sickening, in a good way.
[00:49:28.978 --> 00:49:32.679]  I'm gonna skip this network break, I just can't help it, no more.
[00:49:32.939 --> 00:49:38.781]  In a few weeks, we're doing the tones for the satellite anyways, and the TV stations, that's not been done yet, so I can't ever skip a break again.
[00:49:40.142 --> 00:49:43.403]  Under contract, I can't do it, so just enjoy it, folks, because it's about to all end.
[00:49:47.594 --> 00:49:48.714]  I want to go to this next clip.
[00:49:48.994 --> 00:49:50.835]  Let's go to the end of the internet.
[00:49:50.895 --> 00:49:51.975]  It's already happening.
[00:49:52.555 --> 00:50:01.856]  Zuckerberg, five months ago, had the head of the Chinese censors here for two weeks teaching them how to censor.
[00:50:04.197 --> 00:50:04.617]  There it is.
[00:50:04.717 --> 00:50:12.778]  Mark Zuckerberg caught on hot mic last week saying Facebook will censor any immigrant post and will do a better job and will need to do some more work.
[00:50:12.878 --> 00:50:16.939]  To Merkel, whose parents were communists.
[00:50:21.926 --> 00:50:22.827]  And what is communism?
[00:50:22.907 --> 00:50:25.789]  It's Rothschild, Rockefeller-funded tyranny.
[00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:30.853]  It's oligarch tyranny masquerading as the people getting a free lunch.
[00:50:32.074 --> 00:50:36.837]  And yeah, you get a free lunch in a socialist move until they take you communist or fascist.
[00:50:37.238 --> 00:50:42.181]  But socialism always falls to fascism or communism and variants thereof.
[00:50:43.603 --> 00:50:47.626]  All the political spectrum we're taught is just names, folks.
[00:50:48.891 --> 00:50:51.192]  Cameras, black uniforms, total surveillance.
[00:50:51.432 --> 00:50:53.833]  We'll take your kids if you criticize open borders.
[00:50:54.113 --> 00:51:02.277]  This is the conquering of Europe and we've got the socialist leader, the president of France, saying total war.
[00:51:02.857 --> 00:51:05.278]  Europe is collapsing when they're the ones doing it.
[00:51:05.498 --> 00:51:07.679]  And the answer is do what we say and we'll save Europe.
[00:51:08.059 --> 00:51:10.080]  Give us more emergency powers, we'll save Europe.
[00:51:10.856 --> 00:51:12.036]  Let us bring in the immigrants.
[00:51:12.117 --> 00:51:12.937]  We'll fix it.
[00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:21.780]  There's going to be a war here between indigenous Europeans and all these Arabs and North Africans, so we've got to give us emergency powers.
[00:51:24.822 --> 00:51:29.884]  And they're talking about that because now the French Prime Minister has broke and declared war.
[00:51:29.904 --> 00:51:30.724]  Let's put that back up.
[00:51:31.897 --> 00:51:33.159]  I don't think so.
[00:51:50.396 --> 00:51:54.058]  At the end of World War II, a few years later, France had gotten nuclear weapons.
[00:51:54.898 --> 00:52:00.622]  And there was actually a soft coup where they threw NATO out, and France wouldn't join NATO, and they seized airfields.
[00:52:00.662 --> 00:52:01.222]  The French did.
[00:52:01.282 --> 00:52:01.522]  Good!
[00:52:01.542 --> 00:52:03.663]  Let's see it again, French!
[00:52:03.943 --> 00:52:04.984]  You're not a bunch of wimps!
[00:52:05.024 --> 00:52:06.585]  You conquered most of the world before!
[00:52:07.245 --> 00:52:10.607]  You've been taken over by a bunch of scum and taught to be socialist cowards.
[00:52:10.847 --> 00:52:12.768]  They've been sitting on you since World War II.
[00:52:12.788 --> 00:52:15.510]  My God, what'd you kill?
[00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:17.611]  Like nine million Germans in World War I?
[00:52:18.985 --> 00:52:22.088]  Everybody that calls the French a bunch of wimps, the French helped create this country.
[00:52:23.028 --> 00:52:23.929]  The French aren't wimps.
[00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:25.531]  Stop being wimps.
[00:52:25.831 --> 00:52:27.492]  Stop letting the socialists capture you.
[00:52:27.652 --> 00:52:31.075]  And don't be enemies with the average Muslim, but know they're being used as a weapon.
[00:52:31.395 --> 00:52:32.296]  Absolutely they are.
[00:52:34.278 --> 00:52:35.619]  Stop political correctness.
[00:52:37.561 --> 00:52:39.322]  Arrest the stinking president.
[00:52:39.362 --> 00:52:39.903]  He's a traitor.
[00:52:40.863 --> 00:52:41.644]  It's time, folks.
[00:52:41.684 --> 00:52:42.465]  People are sick of it.
[00:52:43.746 --> 00:52:47.787]  The socialists know people are waking up, and they're getting ready to take down the West, folks.
[00:52:48.207 --> 00:52:50.088]  This is the equivalent of a Soviet takeover.
[00:52:50.708 --> 00:52:52.989]  But it's being directed by megabanks who are offshore.
[00:52:53.489 --> 00:52:55.970]  It's just so, it's such an incredible time to be alive.
[00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:57.571]  Do people not realize that?
[00:52:59.611 --> 00:53:02.132]  I wanted to stand up in this restaurant I was in, because there were no rooms.
[00:53:02.152 --> 00:53:03.653]  We sat at the bar Sunday.
[00:53:03.673 --> 00:53:04.313]  I talked about it.
[00:53:06.974 --> 00:53:08.074]  And I ate Eggs Benedict.
[00:53:09.898 --> 00:53:12.759]  And I was watching all these grown men watch football, and I get it.
[00:53:13.159 --> 00:53:14.039]  I used to love football.
[00:53:14.659 --> 00:53:20.321]  It's just that it's a distraction from world war, economic crazy town.
[00:53:20.361 --> 00:53:24.542]  I mean, the whole world's lining up for fireworks the planet's never seen right now.
[00:53:25.102 --> 00:53:26.502]  They're coming after our freedom.
[00:53:26.662 --> 00:53:27.903]  They're coming after our kids.
[00:53:28.063 --> 00:53:29.483]  They're coming after our medical freedom.
[00:53:29.603 --> 00:53:31.083]  They're coming after our guns.
[00:53:31.804 --> 00:53:33.044]  They mean business!
[00:53:35.236 --> 00:53:41.378]  And in the civil war that's going to ensue, the soft civil war, that they're already calling a civil war in Europe now, now they're calling it that.
[00:53:41.758 --> 00:53:43.038]  The Prime Minister and the President.
[00:53:44.359 --> 00:53:44.879]  In a fight.
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:53.061]  They've induced us into this crisis to bring in their Hegelian dialectic of their solution.
[00:53:53.082 --> 00:53:59.764]  You can see it, the same strategies in America, the same strategies in Europe.
[00:54:00.084 --> 00:54:03.965]  Dissolving the borders, bringing in the refugees, filling them full of hatred.
[00:54:04.955 --> 00:54:07.757]  Sticking a silver spoon in their mouth and telling them they deserve everything.
[00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:09.899]  Creating racial hatred.
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:15.563]  Colleges across America now say to be white is bad.
[00:54:16.664 --> 00:54:23.509]  I was talking to, again, a PhD student at a major psychology department just two weeks ago.
[00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:26.231]  A guy I've known very well, very successful.
[00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:27.312]  He wants to go back for another career.
[00:54:31.716 --> 00:54:34.498]  And they basically told him it is inherently bad to be white.
[00:54:35.968 --> 00:54:43.172]  And when you make a mistake, we're going to give you a zero on your paper, but minorities can make mistakes, and it's fine.
[00:54:43.773 --> 00:54:44.473]  I told him a straight face.
[00:54:44.513 --> 00:54:46.394]  He went to the Dean, and they said, that's right, that's how this works.
[00:54:47.695 --> 00:54:48.635]  And he said, but it's we.
[00:54:48.655 --> 00:54:49.256]  This guy's a liberal.
[00:54:49.276 --> 00:54:50.216]  He goes, we're all together.
[00:54:50.256 --> 00:54:50.997]  We're humanity.
[00:54:51.057 --> 00:54:51.317]  We.
[00:54:51.337 --> 00:54:56.660]  And they're like, this is no we.
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:58.421]  Academic probation.
[00:55:00.402 --> 00:55:02.183]  One more move, and you're out of here.
[00:55:03.784 --> 00:55:04.445]  You've gone from
[00:55:06.005 --> 00:55:09.368]  A 3.8, a 3.9, we're going to bring you down and we're going to teach you.
[00:55:09.388 --> 00:55:13.512]  And the person he's talking to is as white as the driven snow.
[00:55:14.793 --> 00:55:16.835]  Because it's a cult, it's a takeover.
[00:55:17.456 --> 00:55:18.998]  It has nothing to do with the minorities.
[00:55:19.178 --> 00:55:21.500]  They're going to absolutely enslave them afterwards.
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.642]  They're going to bioweapon the third world.
[00:55:23.822 --> 00:55:24.183]  Watch.
[00:55:24.403 --> 00:55:25.304]  They've already been doing it.
[00:55:25.464 --> 00:55:27.326]  They've been caught doing it in testing.
[00:55:31.271 --> 00:55:37.053]  They're already sterilizing people all over the third world, but the masses are so big they're going to use what's left as weapons.
[00:55:38.634 --> 00:55:46.618]  We save the third world, we industrialize them, we build them up, then they go to 1.5 children naturally.
[00:55:47.158 --> 00:55:49.459]  That's what wealthy people do, or middle class do.
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:53.921]  Then we export our populations that want to go to space.
[00:55:54.221 --> 00:55:54.861]  It's unlimited.
[00:55:54.881 --> 00:55:55.741]  It's a beautiful plan.
[00:55:55.982 --> 00:55:56.582]  We can do it.
[00:55:56.782 --> 00:55:57.642]  It's being suppressed.
[00:55:57.882 --> 00:55:58.943]  It's been decided against.
[00:56:00.506 --> 00:56:12.693]  We've got to have a free internet, we've got to have free communication so we can put out a better idea of the future so people buy into believing in humanity instead of hating it with these eugenicists, transhumanists, exterminists.
[00:56:14.594 --> 00:56:21.819]  You're going to see stuff that makes Hitler look like a choir boy in the future if these people really get rolling and they're close.
[00:56:22.739 --> 00:56:24.240]  Let's go to Matt Rogers, the second clip.
[00:56:25.661 --> 00:56:29.103]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face it's over for me.
[00:56:31.009 --> 00:56:31.710]  It's over for you.
[00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:34.251]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[00:56:34.531 --> 00:56:35.132]  You're out of there.
[00:56:35.752 --> 00:56:38.074]  They're going to make it so headlines you can't even use headlines.
[00:56:39.074 --> 00:56:43.057]  To have a Supreme Court justice say that to my face that it's over.
[00:56:43.517 --> 00:56:46.839]  They've got the votes, which means time is limited.
[00:56:47.159 --> 00:56:48.500]  Time is not forever.
[00:56:49.341 --> 00:56:52.463]  How many more moons and sunrises will you see in your life?
[00:56:53.243 --> 00:56:54.284]  Uh, rise and fall.
[00:56:54.484 --> 00:56:55.445]  There's not that many.
[00:56:55.585 --> 00:56:57.086]  It's a small amount.
[00:56:57.586 --> 00:57:03.151]  So for people to be saying with this attitude, oh, I'll get on with my life and my greatness sometime.
[00:57:03.251 --> 00:57:03.471]  No.
[00:57:03.711 --> 00:57:04.572]  No, you can't.
[00:57:04.652 --> 00:57:06.553]  We're being enslaved now, and that's it.
[00:57:06.733 --> 00:57:11.677]  Under the TPP, they admit you can't put a headline to the New York Times.
[00:57:11.937 --> 00:57:13.939]  You're sending massive traffic to them.
[00:57:14.259 --> 00:57:16.741]  They're claiming you're taking their words.
[00:57:17.001 --> 00:57:17.802]  This is insane.
[00:57:17.862 --> 00:57:21.625]  And you had the Justice Stephen Breyer said, we need to look at a global law now.
[00:57:21.645 --> 00:57:22.606]  Remember just recently?
[00:57:23.887 --> 00:57:26.348]  So they're getting ready for these decisions to come.
[00:57:26.369 --> 00:57:28.030]  You thought Obamacare was shocking.
[00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:30.191]  You thought some of these other decisions were shocking.
[00:57:30.251 --> 00:57:41.060]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board.
[00:57:44.422 --> 00:57:47.384]  And of course Aaron Swartz was fighting all of this and they murdered him.
[00:57:47.404 --> 00:57:48.005]  They hung him.
[00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:52.651]  It's, it's real.
[00:57:52.991 --> 00:58:05.415]  Reality is so over-the-top incredible and I just can't believe that so many people are walking through it like a matrix or they think if they're halfway aware that it's like work and well I just don't want to know, I don't want to be involved.
[00:58:05.756 --> 00:58:12.198]  You're being attacked, you're having your future drained off while you're distracted with the whole Holly weird culture.
[00:58:14.915 --> 00:58:16.957]  Our children are being culturally taken away from us.
[00:58:17.037 --> 00:58:19.339]  We're being deeply conquered.
[00:58:19.419 --> 00:58:23.102]  We're gonna go to break, come back with more clips, and then I'm gonna get into all the world news, I promise.
[00:58:24.503 --> 00:58:29.848]  We're gonna do it.
[00:58:29.868 --> 00:58:31.149]  There's just so much.
[00:58:31.169 --> 00:58:33.111]  800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[00:58:35.093 --> 00:58:37.895]  But we won't be able to... I thought Harry Dent was on in the third hour.
[00:58:37.935 --> 00:58:38.796]  He's on in the second hour.
[00:58:40.337 --> 00:58:40.598]  Okay.
[00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:44.194]  All right, well, we'll have to work news in with him while he's on.
[00:58:44.755 --> 00:58:47.379]  I want to talk to him about the economy, but I need to get to all this news as well.
[00:58:47.719 --> 00:58:49.302]  Then Liane McAdoo hosts the fourth hour.
[00:58:51.445 --> 00:58:52.767]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:59:35.128 --> 00:59:39.089]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:17.500]  Big Brother.
[01:00:18.161 --> 01:00:19.201]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:19.942 --> 01:00:21.042]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:21.702 --> 01:00:22.503]  You want answers?
[01:00:23.263 --> 01:00:24.204]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:24.824 --> 01:00:28.446]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:29.006 --> 01:00:33.068]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:48.283]  In a moment, Matt Drudge talks about the deliberate repression of humanity.
[01:00:48.983 --> 01:00:51.924]  Then, Mr. Dent joins us for 30 minutes.
[01:00:51.964 --> 01:00:54.505]  Then I'll go to your calls and more of the news.
[01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:58.467]  But we have launched it at RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[01:00:59.687 --> 01:01:05.009]  I'm asking everyone to go to Infowars.com and get the story that's red-linked at the top.
[01:01:05.409 --> 01:01:08.310]  Matt Drudge challenges Obama.
[01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:09.731]  Give up your guns.
[01:01:09.911 --> 01:01:12.472]  Hashtag DisharmObama.
[01:01:13.598 --> 01:01:14.819]  I need you to retweet that.
[01:01:14.859 --> 01:01:16.080]  I need you to Facebook that.
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.062]  I need you to make memes of that.
[01:01:18.562 --> 01:01:22.005]  We have a meme that is up on the site.
[01:01:22.025 --> 01:01:25.027]  Wants to disarm everyone except Secret Service.
[01:01:27.369 --> 01:01:29.371]  Wants everyone's guns but his own.
[01:01:29.411 --> 01:01:31.332]  You can also show the photo of him shooting the shotgun.
[01:01:32.233 --> 01:01:33.854]  And, you know, he got up a few days ago.
[01:01:33.875 --> 01:01:35.696]  I want to play that clip again if you guys can pull it up.
[01:01:37.477 --> 01:01:38.799]  And Obama said, I don't want your guns.
[01:01:39.079 --> 01:01:40.180]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[01:01:40.885 --> 01:01:43.807]  Hillary, I didn't have a second server to hide any emails.
[01:01:44.247 --> 01:01:45.288]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[01:01:45.908 --> 01:01:48.009]  Al Capone, I didn't sell illegal whiskey.
[01:01:48.189 --> 01:01:49.210]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:52.912]  Adolf Hitler, I didn't have a little mustache under my nose called a Hitler.
[01:01:53.172 --> 01:01:54.113]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[01:01:54.353 --> 01:01:57.034]  George Washington, I didn't chop down a cherry tree.
[01:01:57.074 --> 01:01:58.015]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[01:01:58.075 --> 01:01:59.936]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:02:00.256 --> 01:02:03.278]  The blatant, the blatant lying of these people.
[01:02:04.957 --> 01:02:05.637]  Let's go to this clip.
[01:02:05.677 --> 01:02:06.398]  It's very powerful.
[01:02:06.438 --> 01:02:09.119]  Matt Drudge deplores the limit repression of humanity.
[01:02:09.439 --> 01:02:16.883]  Please get the hashtag out where we're calling for Obama to turn in his guns and for Hollywood people to turn in theirs.
[01:02:17.183 --> 01:02:20.004]  It's time for all you people to put your money where your mouth is.
[01:02:20.044 --> 01:02:21.505]  Here's the latest clip.
[01:02:22.526 --> 01:02:33.989]  Looking at the open announcements by the Pope for world government, carbon taxes, looking for Obama announcing similar things, they've gone from denying this planetary system is being set up to now admitting it.
[01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:38.971]  We've got all these key meetings, TPP being agreed on just a few days ago.
[01:02:40.864 --> 01:02:44.629]  How is that affecting the people that were brainwashed and told none of this was happening?
[01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:49.336]  How are they going to respond now when all of this starts coming to fruition?
[01:02:49.897 --> 01:02:53.042]  I've been traveling a lot and I'm seeing a lot of desperation everywhere.
[01:02:53.142 --> 01:02:54.524]  A lot of sad desperation.
[01:02:55.194 --> 01:03:01.537]  I was just in an airport, and even down to this, a woman selling Southwest Airlines credit cards, standing like a robot.
[01:03:01.917 --> 01:03:03.098]  Have you signed up yet?
[01:03:03.538 --> 01:03:04.899]  Are you a member of the club?
[01:03:05.159 --> 01:03:05.839]  It was tragic.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:10.462]  This is a mature woman with a beautiful face and life, and I'm like, how did she get there?
[01:03:11.118 --> 01:03:14.241]  What has happened to this culture that she's now standing as a robot like this?
[01:03:14.481 --> 01:03:21.468]  They are sucking our ability to make an income that is compatible with what you need to.
[01:03:21.528 --> 01:03:23.690]  So I'm getting a little frightened as I travel.
[01:03:24.391 --> 01:03:29.455]  On the other side of it, when I go to New York and I see some of the billionaires, it's the other side.
[01:03:29.936 --> 01:03:30.516]  Endless.
[01:03:30.937 --> 01:03:32.898]  You know, they're fighting over pieces of artwork.
[01:03:33.679 --> 01:03:38.243]  It's gotten to the point where the have-and-they-have-nots here is breaking.
[01:03:38.904 --> 01:03:46.651]  And it's the billionaires that are mainly funding the whole leftist redistribution movement because they end up getting the money in corporate welfare and insider deals.
[01:03:46.711 --> 01:03:47.351]  It's so sick.
[01:03:48.632 --> 01:03:49.693]  I watched a great film.
[01:03:49.713 --> 01:03:54.577]  I don't know if you've seen it yet, but it's The Best of Enemies about Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley.
[01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:55.238]  Have you seen that yet?
[01:03:55.298 --> 01:03:55.458]  No.
[01:03:55.658 --> 01:03:56.279]  You've got to see it.
[01:03:58.101 --> 01:04:05.287]  It shows Gore Vidal arguing saying the answer is... Oh, and by the way, why are we not allowed to have a Gore Vidal-William Buckley anymore in the media scene?
[01:04:05.307 --> 01:04:06.308]  Do you see who they hire?
[01:04:06.849 --> 01:04:08.971]  Do you see who's hired for the shows?
[01:04:09.271 --> 01:04:10.192]  How dull they are?
[01:04:10.232 --> 01:04:10.412]  Yes.
[01:04:10.972 --> 01:04:11.433]  Dull!
[01:04:11.813 --> 01:04:12.554]  Dull as dishwater.
[01:04:12.574 --> 01:04:14.695]  They want you to tune out of politics and into entertainment.
[01:04:14.736 --> 01:04:18.259]  Yes, they make... Where are the flamboyant characters?
[01:04:18.479 --> 01:04:20.821]  This is what America desperately needs right now.
[01:04:20.921 --> 01:04:25.385]  Flamboyant, intellectual characters who can cut different ways.
[01:04:26.325 --> 01:04:27.246]  And that's just what I'm missing.
[01:04:27.326 --> 01:04:32.290]  I've been fortunate enough to meet some of the greats of this generation, and I've got to tell you, they are there.
[01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:39.715]  It's just they are suppressed and hidden, and they're not hired the way Gore Vidal and Buckley were back a previous generation.
[01:04:39.755 --> 01:04:41.136]  They were not afraid of ideas.
[01:04:41.617 --> 01:04:45.760]  This generation is frightened of ideas, or at least it's being suppressed.
[01:04:47.481 --> 01:04:53.826]  And that's what political correctness is, is a war on debate, a war on diversity, a war on liberalism.
[01:04:56.064 --> 01:04:58.505]  A war on renaissance, a war on freedom.
[01:04:59.706 --> 01:05:03.508]  It is a war on discussion, a war on language.
[01:05:03.628 --> 01:05:04.489]  It is 1984.
[01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:09.151]  Come true in 2015 and beyond.
[01:05:10.732 --> 01:05:18.237]  Presidential candidates today strategize over every last detail of a candidate's image, especially an identity candidate like Hillary.
[01:05:18.537 --> 01:05:22.139]  How important is it for there to be a woman president in the United States?
[01:05:22.932 --> 01:05:29.195]  The National Journal has pointed out that candidates now view soundtracks as a key part of that carefully crafted image.
[01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:34.417]  So, maybe Hillary should choose a campaign song that plays against type.
[01:05:34.537 --> 01:05:35.718]  You know, Humble.
[01:05:38.598 --> 01:05:44.462]  Hillary has paid a consulting firm $9,000 to create a soundtrack for her campaign.
[01:05:45.123 --> 01:05:47.744]  I just don't think people would believe this song, though.
[01:05:48.425 --> 01:05:54.689]  She's being abandoned by unions, by multinational corporate donors who are worried.
[01:05:54.709 --> 01:05:58.292]  44% of her Twitter followers, 1.4 million, are fake.
[01:05:58.892 --> 01:06:01.674]  Maybe her campaign theme should be... Help!
[01:06:02.355 --> 01:06:03.416]  I need somebody!
[01:06:03.476 --> 01:06:04.176]  Help!
[01:06:04.536 --> 01:06:06.137]  Not just anybody!
[01:06:06.238 --> 01:06:08.159]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:06:10.632 --> 01:06:16.076]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[01:06:16.376 --> 01:06:30.827]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[01:06:31.087 --> 01:06:38.893]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[01:06:39.093 --> 01:06:44.558]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[01:06:44.658 --> 01:06:48.040]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.

[01:06:52.364 --> 01:06:56.227]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.

[01:07:13.681 --> 01:07:23.068]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:07:23.408 --> 01:07:25.970]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:29.473]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:07:29.673 --> 01:07:35.697]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:07:35.997 --> 01:07:40.841]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:07:41.121 --> 01:07:47.304]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:07:47.504 --> 01:07:54.967]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:07:55.247 --> 01:08:02.510]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:08:12.148 --> 01:08:17.175]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:17.575 --> 01:08:19.878]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:19.898 --> 01:08:27.388]  You gotta love this!
[01:08:28.769 --> 01:08:39.998]  Roll Call is reporting that the Democrats want a ethics probe of Congressman McCarthy and Gowdy, who've been leading the way in the investigation, at least on the surface, of Benghazi.
[01:08:40.679 --> 01:08:51.808]  But what that'll really do is make McCarthy get elected as the new Speaker of the House by making him a cause celeb with Republicans who want to see justice on Benghazi.
[01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:54.470]  See, that's how my brain works.
[01:08:55.050 --> 01:08:56.892]  I just instantly saw what that's really gonna do.
[01:08:57.910 --> 01:09:00.553]  Because they're not going to get in trouble for their probe of Benghazi.
[01:09:01.493 --> 01:09:02.695]  They followed all the rules.
[01:09:03.736 --> 01:09:10.522]  So, that's a paper tiger to fool conservatives to put in Boehner's aide-de-camp.
[01:09:11.523 --> 01:09:12.544]  His attache.
[01:09:12.964 --> 01:09:14.085]  His right-hand man.
[01:09:14.566 --> 01:09:15.647]  His groom of the stool.
[01:09:17.969 --> 01:09:22.333]  Our guest is with us until 33 after, then I'm going to launch into the news.
[01:09:23.294 --> 01:09:37.367]  The Trump news, the election news, the Vatican news, the Matt Drudge news, that is now in many graphs, Google, Facebook, you name it, in the top three stories in the country.
[01:09:37.387 --> 01:09:43.934]  His visitation of this facility yesterday and the bombshell stuff he had to say.
[01:09:44.414 --> 01:09:47.397]  It's clear that this is the most hardcore Drudge has ever been.
[01:09:49.326 --> 01:09:53.709]  And talking to him last night, it was no secret that this was the next level.
[01:09:54.890 --> 01:10:10.341]  I think you can say Matt Drudge is getting ready to take the gloves off because of the open, naked parade of abuse and tyranny that is being foisted on us in an attempt to make us submit to an even greater level of corruption.
[01:10:10.361 --> 01:10:16.085]  But you know, Newtonian physics, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:10:18.439 --> 01:10:19.799]  And we are now at that threshold.
[01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:29.962]  This is 100% brazen corruption in everyone's face, and everything from... you name it.
[01:10:29.982 --> 01:10:36.344]  I mean, there are hundreds of newspapers reporting on it right now, some of them seriously, some of them not, making jokes about it with a conspiracy theory term.
[01:10:36.824 --> 01:10:45.047]  I mean, I would be so insulted as a reader if someone put, monger conspiracy nut Alex Jones has bizarre drudge interview.
[01:10:45.916 --> 01:10:48.037]  I mean, it's those words just re-scrambled.
[01:10:48.057 --> 01:10:55.042]  They don't even need humans to write these articles, even though they still have them in some cases, because they just give them the script, and then the computer just rearranges it.
[01:10:55.383 --> 01:11:03.708]  That's how the CIA patented bot writers they came out with five years ago operate, and now Google and others are actually using that.
[01:11:04.909 --> 01:11:08.492]  I can tell these articles, when they've been written, because they'll make no sense, but it still doesn't matter.
[01:11:08.512 --> 01:11:11.634]  The sheeple will sit there and read it, because the language has been dumbed down so far.
[01:11:13.956 --> 01:11:21.539]  And then Matt Drudge comes on and profoundly talks about a Supreme Court Justice telling him, we've been told they're going to ban free speech, they're going to shut you down.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.881]  The FCC's come out and said that's admitted.
[01:11:25.221 --> 01:11:28.403]  We've got like 10 different czars under Obama saying do it.
[01:11:28.583 --> 01:11:29.763]  They're doing it all over the world.
[01:11:30.023 --> 01:11:37.447]  And then it's a joke to people in the press who are going to have their future and their children's futures literally sucked out of them.
[01:11:38.237 --> 01:11:40.880]  You people do not have any self-preservation skills.
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:42.222]  All right, we're going to our guest.
[01:11:42.262 --> 01:11:43.763]  I really appreciate him joining us.
[01:11:44.224 --> 01:11:49.370]  Dent Research Director, formerly a high-level analyst at Bain Capital.
[01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:52.733]  I'm not going to get into his MBA from Harvard and the rest of his degrees.
[01:11:53.014 --> 01:11:54.175]  HarryDent.com.
[01:11:54.956 --> 01:11:55.577]  And he joins us.
[01:11:55.597 --> 01:11:57.459]  He's the best-selling author of The Demographic Cliff.
[01:11:57.819 --> 01:11:57.939]  Yeah.
[01:12:17.308 --> 01:12:20.170]  Really showing that what he predicted, unfortunately, is spot on.
[01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:26.874]  We now have the Fed Chairman coming out two days ago on Monday and saying, yes, the numbers are bad, the economy is not in good shape.
[01:12:27.594 --> 01:12:37.300]  So they've gone from saying everything's fine, drink the Kool-Aid, you're gonna go to heaven, Jim Jones loves you, Ben Bernanke loves you, Janet Yellen loves you, Obama loves you,
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:38.542]  Everyone loves you.
[01:12:38.602 --> 01:12:39.223]  Boehner loves you.
[01:12:39.263 --> 01:12:40.044]  The Pope loves you.
[01:12:40.344 --> 01:12:43.929]  Everything's green pastures to now signifying things are in trouble.
[01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:46.373]  So what do you expect to happen now?
[01:12:46.413 --> 01:12:47.855]  You actually predicted they wouldn't raise rates?
[01:12:48.236 --> 01:12:49.397]  You say they're still not going to do that?
[01:12:49.878 --> 01:12:50.920]  Mr. Dent, thank you for joining us.
[01:12:52.048 --> 01:12:52.528]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:12:52.748 --> 01:12:56.970]  I'm also warning people, especially today, that I think there's another mini-crash coming.
[01:12:57.010 --> 01:13:00.951]  We saw one in late August and the market was down over 10% in five days.
[01:13:01.831 --> 01:13:05.212]  I think that's going to happen between today and next Friday.
[01:13:05.292 --> 01:13:10.714]  So a little over a week, we could see the markets drop 10% or more again.
[01:13:10.794 --> 01:13:12.715]  I've got one chart you can show where I'm
[01:13:13.275 --> 01:13:13.955]  We're good to go.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.604]  Uh, 300 at a minimum, and maybe as low as 14,200 on Dow.
[01:13:32.624 --> 01:13:36.048]  So that's, you know, that's 10%, 15% from here.
[01:13:36.068 --> 01:13:37.249]  So we're just warning people.
[01:13:37.730 --> 01:13:39.892]  Everybody keeps thinking, Oh, this is a correction.
[01:13:39.952 --> 01:13:40.292]  It's over.
[01:13:40.332 --> 01:13:42.274]  That's what Wall Street keeps telling everybody.
[01:13:42.615 --> 01:13:45.718]  This is the beginning of a major crash is going to be stronger.
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:54.105]  Then 2008 was because we've only created a greater bubble with all this endless quantitative easing and zero interest rates forever.
[01:13:54.566 --> 01:13:58.688]  And so we got another bigger bubble that's going to burst, but it's going to burst over the next year and a half.
[01:13:58.968 --> 01:14:00.389]  Real quickly, the next slide.
[01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:03.371]  So it says called Dow crash comparison.
[01:14:03.992 --> 01:14:05.733]  What would happen if this crash?
[01:14:06.895 --> 01:14:19.184]  In the same time frame, took a similar pattern to from late 2007 to early 2009, and we're already following this pattern, and going down here the next week would bring us very close in line with this pattern.
[01:14:19.484 --> 01:14:24.087]  Then we get another bounce, but what we've been warning people, Alex, is that this is just the beginning.
[01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:29.611]  The worst crash will come probably in the first half or so of next year.
[01:14:29.731 --> 01:14:31.813]  It's the middle wave down that is usually
[01:14:32.413 --> 01:14:52.815]  The worst so so people should use these rallies the market keeps when the market crashes like this people get too bearish too many people get short and so the big traders see that and then they just blow them out they drive the market up to what's called a short squeeze and they blow out all these people's stops and stuff
[01:14:53.593 --> 01:14:55.875]  And that causes short rallies like we just saw.
[01:14:55.895 --> 01:14:59.998]  But we warned our subscribers this morning, this is one of those short squeezes.
[01:15:00.298 --> 01:15:03.720]  The market's likely to reverse sharply down, so don't believe it.
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:07.063]  And already today, it looks like the market is reversing.
[01:15:07.123 --> 01:15:09.244]  So we're saying this is a good day to get out.
[01:15:09.785 --> 01:15:15.449]  If we do have another 10% or more crash, even with the bounce to follow, we may not get back to these levels.
[01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:24.153]  Sure, and you were on a month and a half ago, the exact dates are on Infowars.com, and you said within two weeks this is all going to start, and two weeks later that was the next big drop.
[01:15:25.994 --> 01:15:31.297]  Yeah, you know, I mean, there are times a year when you're ready to have a crash like this.
[01:15:31.317 --> 01:15:40.321]  There's times from mid-August to mid-October is one of those times when you're most likely to have a stock crash, and that's exactly what happened.
[01:15:40.361 --> 01:15:42.362]  This crash got serious in mid-August,
[01:15:43.041 --> 01:15:44.364]  Uh, crashed in the late August.
[01:15:44.444 --> 01:15:47.770]  It bounced and now it looks like it's going to crash again in the mid-October.
[01:15:48.251 --> 01:15:49.734]  So this is par for the course.
[01:15:49.774 --> 01:15:51.077]  We'll probably see the worst.
[01:15:51.804 --> 01:15:58.366]  For now, in the next week and a half, but then there'll be another bounce for a month or so, and then the big one will come after that.
[01:15:58.426 --> 01:16:02.127]  So I'm just trying to get people to take this crash seriously.
[01:16:02.167 --> 01:16:03.668]  Don't listen to your stockbroker.
[01:16:03.708 --> 01:16:04.908]  Don't listen to the analyst.
[01:16:04.928 --> 01:16:06.489]  Don't listen to the financial media.
[01:16:07.109 --> 01:16:10.650]  All of them are cheerleaders, like you were saying, for, hey, everything's fine.
[01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:12.311]  Nobody wants anybody to panic.
[01:16:12.351 --> 01:16:14.151]  This isn't about panic, panicking.
[01:16:14.211 --> 01:16:19.433]  It's about realizing the governments have created the greatest bubbles in history, real estate, stocks,
[01:16:20.194 --> 01:16:31.305]  Mr. Dent, unfortunately, you've been proven right.
[01:16:31.465 --> 01:16:33.347]  I mean, we're sitting on top of this giant bubble.
[01:16:33.407 --> 01:16:35.929]  I liken it, as you know, to living on top of an active volcano.
[01:16:35.949 --> 01:16:38.091]  I mean, we know it's going to erupt sometime.
[01:16:38.131 --> 01:16:39.032]  The bigger question is...
[01:16:39.847 --> 01:16:47.693]  You've been scarily, eerily accurate on how this would start unraveling, but as you said, there could be a lot of different triggers.
[01:16:47.733 --> 01:16:53.037]  A major city going under, a state going under, Puerto Rico, a European country, Europe.
[01:16:53.797 --> 01:17:00.742]  Both the Prime Minister and President say they're, quote, in total war, and now there's just rioting in the streets and murders and raping.
[01:17:01.123 --> 01:17:08.068]  I mean, the world is obviously already, to a great extent, in an unevenly distributed depression.
[01:17:09.423 --> 01:17:12.209]  Yeah, it is, and governments are fighting it with quantitative easing.
[01:17:12.269 --> 01:17:19.545]  Quantitative easing is a way of keeping a depression or deflationary deleveraging of debt and bubbles from happening.
[01:17:19.586 --> 01:17:20.027]  So they're just...
[01:17:20.712 --> 01:17:24.353]  Pulling out a fire hose, trying to prevent something that's inevitable.
[01:17:24.393 --> 01:17:28.894]  The sooner these bubbles burst, the sooner real estate becomes affordable for young couples again.
[01:17:28.914 --> 01:17:34.435]  You know, the sooner all these bubbles burst, so investors can invest in the long term and get some returns.
[01:17:34.515 --> 01:17:43.816]  If you buy stocks right now, the best historical models say the best you would expect is a minus one to two percent per year loss over the next 10 years.
[01:17:43.856 --> 01:17:47.117]  In other words, you're almost guaranteed to lose money for a long period of time.
[01:17:47.537 --> 01:17:49.098]  Because stocks are so overvalued.
[01:17:49.158 --> 01:17:50.659]  So yeah, that's what we're saying.
[01:17:50.679 --> 01:17:52.560]  You have to recognize this is a bubble.
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:56.562]  The next chart is a very interesting one, and I've shown it before and I've added one to mention.
[01:17:56.982 --> 01:17:59.223]  It's called the Papal Visit Omen.
[01:18:00.004 --> 01:18:02.505]  The Pope only seems to come over here at the top of bubbles.
[01:18:03.352 --> 01:18:07.336]  So we look back at the last major peaks, which I also call a megaphone pattern.
[01:18:07.676 --> 01:18:12.601]  Higher highs, each bubble takes us to higher highs, and each crash takes us to lower lows.
[01:18:12.861 --> 01:18:21.068]  That's why I've been saying on your show now for several months, that the next stop on the dial, probably late next year, early 2017, is like 5,500 to 6,000.
[01:18:21.168 --> 01:18:26.893]  And by the way, let me just stop you, let me hold you a little bit past 33 if you can do that, because this is so important.
[01:18:27.674 --> 01:18:29.956]  You're a scientist when it comes to economics.
[01:18:30.296 --> 01:18:31.177]  That's what you did for Bain.
[01:18:31.197 --> 01:18:32.338]  That's what you were taught at Harvard.
[01:18:32.718 --> 01:18:34.059]  You've got a great mind, obviously.
[01:18:34.259 --> 01:18:35.380]  You're one of the best out there.
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:41.204]  We don't obviously know why they come at the peak, but that's what I said myself, not even knowing you had this papal chart.
[01:18:41.244 --> 01:18:42.505]  I'd missed this one.
[01:18:42.785 --> 01:18:51.332]  It seems like popes come over here, because I went and looked, right before a crash, and right before global upheaval, they'll do these big western tours.
[01:18:51.412 --> 01:18:52.793]  And so it's not a good omen.
[01:18:53.313 --> 01:18:55.294]  And you look at the chart, it's dead on.
[01:18:56.115 --> 01:19:01.518]  That after a Pope comes in 99, 2008, 2015, it drops right after.
[01:19:02.219 --> 01:19:06.561]  As a scientist, what's happening here?
[01:19:07.502 --> 01:19:12.945]  Well, you know, when somebody's going to do a tour like this when people feel the best, you know?
[01:19:13.305 --> 01:19:18.408]  And so, you know, this is a time where this could happen and everybody wanted to happen.
[01:19:18.448 --> 01:19:20.289]  So I think that's probably the reason.
[01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:21.910]  Of course, this is not the reason.
[01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:23.431]  So he's here to scoop offerings?
[01:19:24.329 --> 01:19:24.592]  Huh?
[01:19:24.996 --> 01:19:26.106]  So he's here to get offerings.
[01:19:27.119 --> 01:19:29.060]  Yeah, yeah, and it's a good time to do it.
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:35.121]  It's easier to do this and get great crowds and acceptance when things are good and everybody's kind of happy.
[01:19:35.141 --> 01:19:43.284]  You know, you come during depressing times and people are feeling like, oh my gosh, you know, things aren't right and something's wrong with the universe.
[01:19:43.324 --> 01:19:48.445]  That's not the time to come out and promote your religion, basically.
[01:19:48.505 --> 01:19:50.586]  So, you know, it makes sense in that way.
[01:19:50.666 --> 01:19:53.227]  But the most important thing is that we're in public.
[01:19:53.407 --> 01:19:53.767]  No, I get it.
[01:19:53.787 --> 01:19:55.988]  He's sharing the sheep before their financial slaughter.
[01:19:57.188 --> 01:20:01.736]  Well, you know, I mean, again, this is not intentional, but this is the type of thing that happens.
[01:20:01.756 --> 01:20:03.039]  The Vatican Bank knows what's going on.
[01:20:03.079 --> 01:20:06.605]  It says, hey, papa, time to get over there, because it's about to be lean times.
[01:20:06.625 --> 01:20:09.650]  We need to get a little bit more money in the old piggy bank for the jet copters.

[01:22:14.498 --> 01:22:15.018]  It's true.
[01:22:15.118 --> 01:22:19.060]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:21.121]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:21.661 --> 01:22:26.143]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[01:24:26.575 --> 01:24:29.718]  What else do folks need to know about the trend we're going into?
[01:24:29.758 --> 01:24:36.044]  I mean, I think we've gone from saying, you're being proven correct, to now the Federal Reserve is admitting this.
[01:24:36.124 --> 01:24:38.025]  We put up the statement, it was in the Associated Press.
[01:24:40.427 --> 01:24:48.058]  Where the head of the Fed said that, you know, these numbers are troubling for the economy, and then we have the former head Bernanke say, this shows that the economy's in trouble.
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.042]  Are they admitting that now?
[01:24:51.923 --> 01:24:54.506]  Because they know it looks too stupid to keep denying it?
[01:24:54.526 --> 01:24:55.388]  Or what does that signify?
[01:24:56.226 --> 01:24:57.167]  Well, I'll tell you what, Alex.
[01:24:57.387 --> 01:24:59.709]  The biggest trigger, as you said, there's many triggers.
[01:24:59.769 --> 01:25:02.792]  One is the weakening of our economy because of demographics.
[01:25:03.272 --> 01:25:04.854]  The euro crisis is obvious.
[01:25:04.874 --> 01:25:08.777]  That's never going to come out of it without unraveling.
[01:25:09.057 --> 01:25:12.901]  But the two biggest triggers right now, number one is this chart I have, China.
[01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:14.823]  The China bubble is finally bursting.
[01:25:14.883 --> 01:25:16.644]  I've been harping on this for years now.
[01:25:17.185 --> 01:25:18.446]  Greatest bubble in history.
[01:25:18.506 --> 01:25:20.588]  Stocks, real estate, especially real estate.
[01:25:21.168 --> 01:25:24.929]  And it's finally crumbling despite the government buying their own stock market.
[01:25:25.429 --> 01:25:32.011]  And you can see here, this has got another wave coming down and it's been going sideways for over a month, a narrow range.
[01:25:32.051 --> 01:25:37.772]  And I've been warning people, this is going to probably be the biggest single trigger of this next mini crash.
[01:25:38.212 --> 01:25:42.993]  And I don't go to bed at night, Alex, without checking the China market that's about 14 hours ahead of us.
[01:25:43.053 --> 01:25:45.834]  So that's another important indicator.
[01:25:45.854 --> 01:25:47.254]  I think you're going to see that down.
[01:25:48.255 --> 01:25:48.555]  Another 20%.
[01:25:48.735 --> 01:25:50.276]  It's already been down 45%.
[01:25:50.436 --> 01:25:53.359]  And then we got a final chart, the oil chart.
[01:25:54.059 --> 01:26:01.546]  Every time oil goes down, oil companies get hit, frackers get crucified, debts start to fail, and whole countries get hit.
[01:26:02.086 --> 01:26:05.749]  So the oil, we've been warning, the oil keeps cracking down.
[01:26:06.150 --> 01:26:09.212]  It broke out down below $80 a couple years ago.
[01:26:09.232 --> 01:26:10.033]  We said, this is it.
[01:26:10.868 --> 01:26:17.954]  Oil is going to keep going down towards $10 to $20 a barrel, and oil looks like it's getting ready to break back down to $30 to $32.
[01:26:18.274 --> 01:26:23.518]  And again, that's just going to show Wall Street and investors the frackers are dead.
[01:26:23.758 --> 01:26:33.746]  They have a trillion dollar industry, $600 billion in leveraged debt and junk bonds, and tons of jobs, especially in Texas and North Dakota.
[01:26:34.146 --> 01:26:37.669]  And these companies are going to go under and never be able to come back again.
[01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:39.691]  They were only, it was only made possible
[01:26:40.211 --> 01:26:40.812]  We're good to go.
[01:27:10.251 --> 01:27:14.195]  Where everything, like you said before, geopolitics around the world is horrible.
[01:27:14.215 --> 01:27:17.918]  We've got a whole cycle on that that's only going to get worse for the next four years.
[01:27:18.418 --> 01:27:21.121]  And demographic trends are absolutely horrible.
[01:27:21.201 --> 01:27:23.883]  And guess who's number one going down in the next few years?
[01:27:24.204 --> 01:27:24.684]  Germany.
[01:27:25.004 --> 01:27:28.988]  The one country that most people think is strong and in a good position.
[01:27:29.048 --> 01:27:31.970]  They've got worse demographic trends than Japan had in the 1990s.
[01:27:34.042 --> 01:27:46.727]  And their answer is unskilled third world labor that is extremely, on average, aggressive and being filled with political class envy by socialists.
[01:27:47.367 --> 01:27:55.290]  What are the socialists going to do when they've been so busy trying to bleed the Christmas pig, but also they hate it so they kick it in the face a bunch?
[01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:57.871]  What are they going to do when the Christmas pig rolls over and dies?
[01:27:59.244 --> 01:28:03.930]  Well, you know, I think that's one of the things that one of the good things about this crisis I'm predicting.
[01:28:04.371 --> 01:28:06.354]  We've been doing a lot of things that don't make sense.
[01:28:06.374 --> 01:28:07.836]  We've been killing the golden goose.
[01:28:07.916 --> 01:28:12.342]  Free market capitalism kind of got married to democracy in the late 1700s.
[01:28:12.602 --> 01:28:15.546]  And we've been on a roll ever since, especially the developed world.
[01:28:15.586 --> 01:28:17.028]  And now the third world catching up.
[01:28:17.388 --> 01:28:23.014]  But governments say, oh no, we can't trust this system anymore with all its dynamics and its inflation and deflation.
[01:28:23.034 --> 01:28:28.159]  And all this power and all this wealth and all this innovation and invention and all this honor and it's so horrible.
[01:28:28.179 --> 01:28:31.682]  Let's screw it up and, you know, teach trendies how to pour Drano in their eyes.
[01:28:32.283 --> 01:28:32.583]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:32.623 --> 01:28:37.828]  They want to control it and turn it into a machine instead of a dynamic, innovative system.
[01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:39.750]  So they just wanted to grow at 3%.
[01:28:41.828 --> 01:28:44.970]  40% GDP, 2% inflation, and never have a recession again.
[01:28:45.230 --> 01:28:46.931]  That is a formula for disaster.
[01:28:46.971 --> 01:28:48.772]  That's not how capitalism works.
[01:28:49.272 --> 01:28:56.778]  It has to have booms and recessions, has to have inflation and deflation, has to have innovation and creative destruction.
[01:28:56.818 --> 01:28:59.719]  And that means you have to have failure for the system to work.
[01:28:59.739 --> 01:29:00.820]  So they don't want any failure.
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:01.741]  They're a bunch of ninnies.
[01:29:02.221 --> 01:29:08.545]  And this crisis is going to force people to realize that the government and central banks couldn't just control the economy.
[01:29:08.906 --> 01:29:10.847]  And why don't we go back to what actually
[01:29:10.947 --> 01:29:15.732]  We're going to go to break.
[01:29:15.772 --> 01:29:17.854]  Come back and do five more minutes and we'll let you get back to work.
[01:29:17.954 --> 01:29:19.295]  But Harry Dent is our guest.
[01:29:19.315 --> 01:29:21.037]  HarryDent.com is the website.
[01:29:21.077 --> 01:29:23.019]  Then I will cover all the other big geopolitical news.
[01:29:23.039 --> 01:29:24.840]  When we come back, I want to ask you this question.
[01:29:26.052 --> 01:29:29.373]  And then I'll let you elaborate on other points you think are important that the audience should know.
[01:29:30.273 --> 01:29:36.395]  What will the political class do, though, with a lot of the new tricks they have up their sleeves that can't stop fundamentals long-term?
[01:29:36.435 --> 01:29:40.017]  But what curveballs do you think might come out of the system?
[01:29:40.057 --> 01:29:48.079]  I see them building up with totalitarianism, classic police state, I think is their answer to these cascading bubbles bursting.
[01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:52.381]  And so I want to get your take on, personally, when you talk to your wife, when you talk to your family,
[01:29:53.021 --> 01:29:59.589]  What you're doing to protect yourself from clearly the social unrest and fallout, I think we're going to see.
[01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:01.131]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.652 --> 01:30:03.234]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:04.175 --> 01:30:06.859]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:11.027 --> 01:30:15.370]  Matt Drudge challenges Barack Obama to give up his guns.
[01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:21.954]  The news icon calls on the President and Hillary Clinton to relinquish their Secret Service protection.
[01:30:22.194 --> 01:30:23.355]  I challenge Hillary.
[01:30:23.635 --> 01:30:25.156]  Take away your Secret Service.
[01:30:25.436 --> 01:30:26.337]  Take it away now.
[01:30:26.457 --> 01:30:27.738]  Have no security around you.
[01:30:28.058 --> 01:30:29.519]  Have no guns around you, Hillary.
[01:30:29.839 --> 01:30:30.560]  I dare you.
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:31.240]  I dare you.
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.541]  Obama, same thing.
[01:30:32.801 --> 01:30:34.062]  Drop your guns, Obama.
[01:30:34.844 --> 01:30:36.766]  Take your secret service away, Obama.
[01:30:36.946 --> 01:30:38.048]  Take it all away.
[01:30:38.228 --> 01:30:40.110]  Leave the White House unguarded, Obama.
[01:30:40.230 --> 01:30:43.133]  Let everybody know there's no guns on the White House grounds, Obama.
[01:30:43.153 --> 01:30:44.775]  You know what would happen in 30 seconds?
[01:30:45.095 --> 01:30:47.118]  Both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth.
[01:30:47.798 --> 01:30:48.759]  So they're asking us!
[01:30:49.659 --> 01:30:54.684]  To drop our guns and to drop our security measures or, or what?
[01:30:55.165 --> 01:31:01.151]  So this thing is very real and I don't see how it's being taken seriously except for the sick voter.
[01:31:01.531 --> 01:31:05.575]  That was yesterday during a surprise appearance on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:05.735 --> 01:31:08.758]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:31:10.703 --> 01:31:14.805]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[01:31:15.005 --> 01:31:19.207]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[01:31:19.247 --> 01:31:26.550]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[01:31:26.710 --> 01:31:37.218]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[01:31:37.379 --> 01:31:40.721]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[01:31:40.901 --> 01:31:41.922]  What do you have to lose?
[01:31:42.042 --> 01:31:50.329]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[01:31:50.469 --> 01:31:53.671]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[01:31:53.771 --> 01:31:57.793]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[01:31:57.974 --> 01:32:00.095]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[01:32:00.275 --> 01:32:07.239]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.

[01:33:31.403 --> 01:33:36.426]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:33:36.446 --> 01:33:37.627]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:39.528 --> 01:33:42.490]  The story is linked on InfoWars.com.
[01:33:42.630 --> 01:33:54.257]  In fact, it's so important, I'm going to have it added to all the other stories we have that are linked on Drudge right now at the top, where it just says, Update, Matt Drudge calls for Obama to turn over his firearms.
[01:33:54.958 --> 01:34:00.161]  We are really pushing this, we are really promoting this on Twitter, at RealAlexJones, on the Facebook.
[01:34:02.136 --> 01:34:05.537]  If you want to defend the Second Amendment, I'm not going to even say, please do this.
[01:34:06.417 --> 01:34:07.277]  You need to do this.
[01:34:07.798 --> 01:34:15.240]  This is the type of meme that could be a major blow, just like we helped launch the meme to fire Boehner with Congressman Jones.
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:18.220]  Remember that?
[01:34:18.781 --> 01:34:20.161]  I'm not saying we have all the credit.
[01:34:20.181 --> 01:34:20.961]  We're just part of that.
[01:34:21.261 --> 01:34:23.722]  You are part of that as the audience, a key part.
[01:34:25.051 --> 01:34:46.074]  And so if you go and send out the different memes we've put out, wants to disarm everyone but won't turn in his guns, with a picture of Obama, with the Secret Service, if you will tweet the article that has the video and the audio of Matt Drudge, Matt Drudge challenges Obama, give up your guns, News Icon calls on President and Hillary to relinquish Secret Service protection.
[01:34:47.875 --> 01:34:49.917]  People are like, well that's ridiculous, he needs to be protected.
[01:34:50.097 --> 01:34:51.598]  Okay, well this is discriminatory.
[01:34:51.658 --> 01:34:53.339]  We pay for him to be protected.
[01:34:53.559 --> 01:34:54.380]  Because he's a god?
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.241]  He's an emperor?
[01:34:55.941 --> 01:34:57.983]  Well, we don't have the right to defend ourselves?
[01:34:59.043 --> 01:35:02.186]  Even though nowhere in jurisprudence, nowhere in law,
[01:35:03.615 --> 01:35:07.216]  In our system, does it say the police have a duty to protect you?
[01:35:07.596 --> 01:35:19.241]  They have a duty to respond to the courts and to the people, to grand juries, to judges, to go out and to grab people who have been suspected of committing a crime or who have been indicted.
[01:35:20.421 --> 01:35:27.564]  So, we don't have to protect you, we can't protect you all the time, most the time, they'll tell you that, but you can't have a gun.
[01:35:29.110 --> 01:35:36.055]  It's not police that are saying that on average, it's the criminal class who are protected by our taxpayer money that have the nerve to do this.
[01:35:36.355 --> 01:35:42.879]  And I know you know this, but the general public, the yuppies, the trendies, they don't know this.
[01:35:42.979 --> 01:35:45.961]  You've got to reach out to these poor victims of brainwashing.
[01:35:46.502 --> 01:35:47.943]  Should I play the Attorney General again?
[01:35:48.783 --> 01:35:54.988]  Saying to the media, the RTF National Convention, the former Attorney General, Eric Holder,
[01:35:55.876 --> 01:35:59.642]  Saying we need to literally, repetitively brainwash the public against guns.
[01:36:00.263 --> 01:36:01.084]  You know, I'm not going to play that.
[01:36:01.104 --> 01:36:04.850]  I want to get Dent's take on the move towards totalitarianism, and then I'll get into the news.
[01:36:04.890 --> 01:36:07.594]  But since I mentioned it, here is Obama, again,
[01:36:09.028 --> 01:36:13.371]  Over the weekend saying it's a conspiracy theory to think he wants our guns.
[01:36:14.152 --> 01:36:24.620]  When I have the CNN clip and others where they're calling for banning them and he's saying we should go the Australian route which is banning everything but single-shot bolt action.
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:26.681]  If you get a special farm permit.
[01:36:26.721 --> 01:36:37.149]  The politics has to change and the people who are troubled by this have to be as intense and as organized and as adamant about this issue as folks
[01:36:39.167 --> 01:36:57.490]  On the other side who are absolutists and think that any gun safety measures are somehow an assault on freedom or communistic or a plot by me to take over and stay in power for
[01:36:59.096 --> 01:36:59.777]  Ever or something.
[01:37:00.278 --> 01:37:03.884]  I mean, there are all kinds of crackpot conspiracy theories that float around there.
[01:37:04.404 --> 01:37:10.133]  Some of which, by the way, are ratified by elected officials in the other party on occasion.
[01:37:11.594 --> 01:37:16.297]  So basically he's saying you're a conspiracy theory, crackpot, and ratifying these theories.
[01:37:17.037 --> 01:37:20.940]  You know, he is going to graduate up to the Secretary of Generalship of the U.N.
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:23.041]  or the head of one of these big mega banks.
[01:37:23.101 --> 01:37:24.442]  That's what he says he wants to do.
[01:37:24.902 --> 01:37:26.663]  That's what Tony Blair has gone on to do.
[01:37:26.703 --> 01:37:28.024]  That's what Clinton's gone on to do.
[01:37:28.344 --> 01:37:31.225]  That's what Clinton has said he wants as the Secretary of Generalship, but he's too sick.
[01:37:31.966 --> 01:37:33.627]  Obama can now get
[01:37:34.864 --> 01:37:37.166]  Globally, a lot of these Muslim countries to vote for him.
[01:37:37.186 --> 01:37:38.426]  That's over a billion people right there.
[01:37:38.446 --> 01:37:40.448]  He can get all the liberals in Europe to vote for him.
[01:37:40.788 --> 01:37:41.929]  This is about global government.
[01:37:43.169 --> 01:37:45.511]  He doesn't want to be the president of America indefinitely.
[01:37:45.531 --> 01:37:47.432]  He wants to go on and dominate and control.
[01:37:47.512 --> 01:37:51.835]  Going back to our guest, Harry Dent of harrydent.com.
[01:37:53.936 --> 01:37:59.680]  Harry, looking at this, the points I just made earlier, I made a statement about
[01:38:01.618 --> 01:38:06.463]  They want us to pay for people's sex changes, or basically they want us to pay for dumping Drano in their eyes.
[01:38:07.724 --> 01:38:09.907]  I don't know if you know about this, but that's mainstream television.
[01:38:10.147 --> 01:38:11.569]  I never played the whole clip for the audience.
[01:38:12.189 --> 01:38:21.099]  They actually say in the newscast, it's wonderful that she poured Drano in her eyes to be blind like others, as if it's bad that we have sight and blind folks don't.
[01:38:21.759 --> 01:38:27.362]  So then we have to ban he or she or mother or father or boy or girl because it hurts folks that don't identify as that.
[01:38:27.702 --> 01:38:38.048]  I don't know if you are aware of that, pouring drain cleaner in your eyes, the next trendy social justice movement from Bancroft Television, that's up on InfoWars.com, linking to mainstream news.
[01:38:38.748 --> 01:38:41.790]  I mean, what is this mass mental illness?
[01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:43.371]  And I think that segues
[01:38:44.668 --> 01:38:49.718]  Into some final statements from you, what do you think about the culture itself?
[01:38:49.758 --> 01:38:55.128]  I mean, have we ever had an irrevocably damaged population like this that's truly
[01:38:56.647 --> 01:39:14.113]  I mean, not the majority, but a large minority of people that are of every race, color, and creed that literally have been artificially made mentally ill by the false reality of trendism, political correctness, whatever it is.
[01:39:14.133 --> 01:39:22.936]  I mean, it's now a major movement, the trans-abled, to pay to have people's arms and legs hacked off, and then we pay for them for life to live in wheelchairs.
[01:39:23.436 --> 01:39:24.557]  They're not playing games.
[01:39:25.618 --> 01:39:28.862]  Will we be conquered by people pouring Drano in their eyes?
[01:39:30.304 --> 01:39:31.586]  Well, I don't know about that.
[01:39:31.606 --> 01:39:36.774]  What I see, Alex, is I've never seen this society, this country, so polarized.
[01:39:37.672 --> 01:39:43.354]  Where people can't agree on anything and Congress can't agree on anything because this boom has been so uneven.
[01:39:43.414 --> 01:39:51.197]  It's been so rigged with special interest and low-cost money that favors certain sectors like Wall Street and stuff.
[01:39:51.237 --> 01:39:55.998]  You know, those people have done extremely well and people who have done nothing but fallen behind.
[01:39:56.278 --> 01:39:58.719]  And those two people can't see the world the same way.
[01:39:59.199 --> 01:40:02.020]  And that really sets up... Sure, but here's my question.
[01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:03.781]  Listen, I'm not trying to be absurd here.
[01:40:05.042 --> 01:40:08.685]  Have you heard about the trans-abled movement and the gender bathrooms?
[01:40:08.945 --> 01:40:12.929]  And I know you'll get into these politics, but I mean, this is a political assault by the establishment.
[01:40:13.209 --> 01:40:20.055]  This is their response to make us so dependent, cloward and piven, so mentally ill that we don't know which way is up.
[01:40:20.095 --> 01:40:21.496]  I mean, that's a real trend.
[01:40:21.817 --> 01:40:24.459]  So I'm saying, what's the master plan in your view?
[01:40:24.539 --> 01:40:25.740]  You just answered the Pope question.
[01:40:26.906 --> 01:40:29.987]  You know, absolutely on target in my view, and it actually taught me something.
[01:40:30.007 --> 01:40:36.830]  So I'm saying, this is a plan in Europe and here to turn the public into a bunch of dysfunctional mental illness factories.
[01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:38.611]  What is the point of that?
[01:40:39.171 --> 01:40:40.992]  Obviously it's been allowed by all this free money.
[01:40:41.352 --> 01:40:46.514]  What do these people do that, once things collapse, do we just let them starve in the streets?
[01:40:46.774 --> 01:40:51.116]  Because if not, they're going to come after us like a giant school of piranha.
[01:40:52.230 --> 01:40:55.833]  Well, you know, the thing is, you can't change, all of this is much bigger than any of us.
[01:40:56.173 --> 01:40:57.234]  We can't change it.
[01:40:57.274 --> 01:41:02.958]  This is an inevitable crisis that has to happen after years and years of preventing it, which only makes it worse.
[01:41:03.038 --> 01:41:06.621]  It's like drinking more and more not to come down from the high or something.
[01:41:06.681 --> 01:41:11.044]  Yeah, it's like feeding 50 grizzly bears in your backyard, and then one day it's going to kill you.
[01:41:13.306 --> 01:41:15.709]  Yeah, all you can do is control your own circumstance.
[01:41:16.109 --> 01:41:25.720]  If you get out of these risky assets, stocks and real estate and stuff, now you're going to preserve your gains and everybody else is going to see them just disappear overnight like in the Great Depression.
[01:41:26.141 --> 01:41:27.622]  Where you live is important.
[01:41:28.243 --> 01:41:34.485]  I don't own any more real estate except for a place in the Caribbean because that's my getaway place if things get very bad.
[01:41:34.905 --> 01:41:40.127]  If people have a choice of living on the outskirts of a major city or downtown, pick the outskirts.
[01:41:40.467 --> 01:41:53.692]  If you're living in the middle of the country between the two big mountain ranges, the Rockies and Alleghenies, you're going to be much better off than people are in highly dense, highly bubbly coastal cities that are going to crash the most and have the most foreclosures.
[01:41:53.752 --> 01:41:55.232]  Yeah, Texas' biggest problem is Houston.
[01:41:55.272 --> 01:41:56.473]  That is a time bomb.
[01:41:57.492 --> 01:41:57.712]  Yeah.
[01:41:58.033 --> 01:42:01.576]  And you know, last time we had a real estate crash, Texas was not hit.
[01:42:01.896 --> 01:42:02.737]  They didn't bubble up.
[01:42:02.777 --> 01:42:07.641]  But because of this fracking bubble and some other things, Texas did have more of a bubble this time.
[01:42:07.701 --> 01:42:12.325]  So Texas is going to have higher unemployment when all these fracking jobs disappear.
[01:42:12.725 --> 01:42:13.986]  Real estate is going to go down.
[01:42:14.447 --> 01:42:19.131]  So you just have to protect yourself and say, look, what can I do to be safe?
[01:42:19.851 --> 01:42:21.593]  What can I do to survive?
[01:42:21.893 --> 01:42:25.656]  And how do I preserve as much wealth as I can and make it safe and liquid?
[01:42:25.676 --> 01:42:28.918]  You don't want to have it in very safe stuff.
[01:42:28.938 --> 01:42:34.583]  You don't want to be sitting in a bank account where they can loan against it and say, oops, I'm sorry, we lost the money and don't have it.
[01:42:34.723 --> 01:42:43.410]  It has to be in your own investment account and you have to be in safe, short-term bonds and even long-term treasury bonds and the best corporate bonds.
[01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:45.832]  Those are the only two things that did well in the Great Depression.
[01:42:46.152 --> 01:42:49.836]  Real estate, commodities, stocks, all did horrible for a decade.
[01:42:50.236 --> 01:42:54.360]  What about what I mentioned before the break, the accelerated move towards totalitarianism?
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:55.982]  A. Do you agree that's happening around the world?
[01:42:56.402 --> 01:43:00.687]  And B. Do you think it'll be successful for the establishment?
[01:43:01.633 --> 01:43:02.594]  Well, I think you're going to get both.
[01:43:02.714 --> 01:43:06.796]  The establishment is going to lose a lot of confidence, especially the Federal Reserve.
[01:43:06.816 --> 01:43:17.281]  But yes, when things get bad and when crime goes up and more people are unemployed and there's more social unrest, there's going to be attempts to kind of control things and make things OK.
[01:43:17.341 --> 01:43:23.304]  So I think you're going to see disintegration and more kind of top-down control at the same time.
[01:43:23.425 --> 01:43:26.026]  In the end, I think the disintegration is going to win.
[01:43:27.216 --> 01:43:32.442]  Well, this elite is so corrupt and so decadent, disintegration is better than total enslavement.
[01:43:33.644 --> 01:43:34.225]  It is, it is.
[01:43:35.690 --> 01:43:36.951]  I'm pulling for the disintegration.
[01:43:37.011 --> 01:43:41.452]  I'm pulling for everybody facing reality and realizing we can't stimulate the economy forever.
[01:43:41.492 --> 01:43:42.953]  We can't get something for nothing.
[01:43:43.213 --> 01:43:52.936]  We can't work for 40 years and then be on the dole for health care and social security for 22 years now that our life expectancy has gone up 10 years in the last several decades.
[01:43:53.217 --> 01:43:55.197]  We're so out of reality in so many things.
[01:43:55.938 --> 01:43:57.438]  A crisis is the only way to fix it.
[01:43:57.478 --> 01:43:59.139]  Special interests control everything.
[01:43:59.459 --> 01:44:00.639]  You can't deal with that.
[01:44:00.799 --> 01:44:02.380]  Every special interest will fight you.
[01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:06.122]  But when the system breaks down, they're going to lose their power as well.
[01:44:06.222 --> 01:44:11.845]  So I think this is, again, a necessary and an inevitable crisis.
[01:44:13.446 --> 01:44:19.129]  And that's why they're scurrying around trying to put bigger institutions in power in, is to try to control all this.
[01:44:19.169 --> 01:44:22.351]  But these are illegitimate institutions now that are totally corrupt.
[01:44:22.391 --> 01:44:23.592]  They need to disintegrate.
[01:44:24.092 --> 01:44:25.132]  They need to disintegrate.
[01:44:25.453 --> 01:44:26.213]  No question about it.
[01:44:26.333 --> 01:44:28.254]  And again, a crisis is the only way to do it at this point.
[01:44:28.434 --> 01:44:30.435]  You can never fix this politically at this point.
[01:44:30.455 --> 01:44:31.436]  It's gotten too extreme.
[01:44:33.717 --> 01:44:37.001]  Harry Dent, I want to thank you so much for joining us.
[01:44:37.462 --> 01:44:39.865]  You have a lot of special deals on your site.
[01:44:40.425 --> 01:44:42.167]  Tell folks where they go to get the book free.
[01:44:43.018 --> 01:44:47.320]  Yeah, again, the book was just updated, so this is a great time to get it.
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:49.961]  All you do is pay shipping and handling, $4.95.
[01:44:50.041 --> 01:44:57.224]  You go to harrydent.com, you can get the free book shipped to you, again, for $4.95, and that's just our hard cost.
[01:44:57.304 --> 01:44:58.625]  We're not making a dime on that.
[01:44:59.165 --> 01:45:04.087]  And we've got a free daily newsletter to keep you updated, also at harrydent.com.
[01:45:04.127 --> 01:45:08.969]  You can see on this upper right-hand side, you just put your email in there, you're done, you're on.
[01:45:09.209 --> 01:45:10.149]  And it's a great newsletter.
[01:45:10.530 --> 01:45:11.250]  Last question.
[01:45:12.802 --> 01:45:18.144]  How long do you think it'll take till we see the disintegration of a lot of this global system?
[01:45:19.284 --> 01:45:23.186]  I think that this broader crisis is going to last in the early part of next decade.
[01:45:23.226 --> 01:45:30.068]  We've said from the beginning that this winter season, we call it, starts in 2008 and it ends around 2022 or so.
[01:45:30.428 --> 01:45:36.610]  But I think we're going to see the worst for the financial markets literally in the next year or year and a half.
[01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:38.791]  So that's what you got to worry about first.
[01:45:39.091 --> 01:45:41.892]  After that, you got to worry about social unrest and all these other things.
[01:45:42.632 --> 01:45:48.240]  Alright, thanks for spending time with us, and congratulations on your predictions continuing to come true, even though it's not good news.
[01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:48.541]  Thank you.
[01:45:48.961 --> 01:45:49.802]  But I guess it is good news.
[01:45:49.822 --> 01:45:51.805]  It needs to break down, but man, I tell ya.
[01:45:52.765 --> 01:45:58.809]  If you're a new listener, I can play news clips of CBS News saying, Mercury's good for your child's brain.
[01:45:59.290 --> 01:46:02.092]  I can play clips with them going, it's so gracious and wonderful.
[01:46:02.432 --> 01:46:06.555]  She has so much courage dumping Drano in her eyes because she wants to be blind like others.
[01:46:06.635 --> 01:46:07.816]  I mean, it's so sick.
[01:46:08.897 --> 01:46:10.418]  And taxpayers should pay for it.
[01:46:10.438 --> 01:46:13.600]  And people are like, oh, that's an extreme, crazy example.
[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:16.963]  No, it's mainstream media pushing it like it's wonderful.
[01:46:17.963 --> 01:46:19.505]  It's weaponized evil.
[01:46:20.506 --> 01:46:25.188]  You've got totally empty weirdos, you know, who basically have Munchausen disorder.
[01:46:27.089 --> 01:46:30.911]  Not by proxy, it's not somebody else doing it, they're hurting themselves to get attention.
[01:46:32.348 --> 01:46:35.331]  And it's like, oh, it's the liberal adrena on your eyes.
[01:46:35.631 --> 01:46:36.272]  Oh, yeah.
[01:46:36.792 --> 01:46:37.413]  This is sick.
[01:46:37.613 --> 01:46:38.234]  This is sickness.
[01:46:38.274 --> 01:46:40.055]  And the media's like, how dare?
[01:46:40.596 --> 01:46:47.422]  There's a whole bunch of articles from Salon to Huffington Post, a bunch of others going, how dare Drudge say that America's sick?
[01:46:47.962 --> 01:46:49.304]  America's not sick.
[01:46:49.744 --> 01:46:50.765]  Of course we're sick.
[01:46:53.167 --> 01:46:54.909]  We're not happy we're saying it's sick.
[01:46:57.751 --> 01:46:58.432]  We are sick.
[01:47:00.623 --> 01:47:02.203]  It's shameful how sick we've gotten.
[01:47:04.484 --> 01:47:05.104]  It's insane.
[01:47:05.124 --> 01:47:06.465]  Let's go to Infowars.com.
[01:47:08.065 --> 01:47:10.786]  Some of the headlines there, and I am going to open the phones up in the next hour.
[01:47:11.126 --> 01:47:12.686]  Matt Drudge challenges Obama.
[01:47:12.746 --> 01:47:13.526]  Give up your guns.
[01:47:13.566 --> 01:47:14.987]  Hashtag disarm Obama.
[01:47:15.707 --> 01:47:18.768]  News icon calls on President Hillary to relinquish Secret Service protection.
[01:47:19.368 --> 01:47:21.008]  I want that article to go viral, folks.
[01:47:21.048 --> 01:47:22.469]  I want you to get that out to everybody you know.
[01:47:23.609 --> 01:47:26.810]  France's president says Muslim rift threatens total war.
[01:47:28.831 --> 01:47:29.972]  We're going to play this clip, guys.
[01:47:29.992 --> 01:47:31.133]  Make sure you have it queued up, please.
[01:47:31.513 --> 01:47:38.858]  Supporter introduces Hillary in Iowa by declaring, Who cares about email Benghazi scandals?
[01:47:39.238 --> 01:47:40.019]  Everybody laughs.
[01:47:40.099 --> 01:47:40.960]  It's so funny.
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:45.823]  Jesse Ventura says he hopes Trump destroys the GOP and Sanders destroys the Democrats.
[01:47:47.504 --> 01:47:50.086]  Well, I mean, Sanders would just be like a dream for the Democrats.
[01:47:50.807 --> 01:47:53.209]  That guy will bait and switch you so fast to make your head spin.
[01:47:53.689 --> 01:47:57.592]  New York Governor Cuomo wants the Dems to shut down government over Second Amendment.
[01:47:58.629 --> 01:48:01.731]  Do whatever option it takes to get confiscation going.
[01:48:01.832 --> 01:48:06.315]  Report Vatican Gay Lobby stages coming out of Senior Priest.
[01:48:07.356 --> 01:48:12.220]  Police arrest man for going over three minutes talk time at City Council meeting.
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:13.280]  That's my friend Mike Hanson.
[01:48:13.621 --> 01:48:16.143]  He's now been charged with resisting arrest, which he doesn't do on tape.
[01:48:16.943 --> 01:48:18.104]  Drudge Facebook.
[01:48:18.605 --> 01:48:23.909]  Drudge says that Facebook and Twitter are internet ghettos designed to demoralize individuals.
[01:48:26.561 --> 01:48:30.424]  And then we've got Paul Watson's video, Conservatism, the new counterculture.
[01:48:34.388 --> 01:48:37.570]  Muslim press is claiming Saudi King's been hospitalized for dementia.
[01:48:38.972 --> 01:48:42.755]  So that's just some of the news that we have up there.
[01:48:44.496 --> 01:48:46.618]  Let me get to some of that news that I just spoke of.
[01:48:46.638 --> 01:48:53.724]  AP investigation, nuclear black market seeks IS extremists, the FBI,
[01:48:54.813 --> 01:49:00.695]  has busted these individuals, I'll go over, trying to find ISIS to sell them dirty bomb material, reportedly.
[01:49:01.336 --> 01:49:13.181]  Over the pulsating beat of an exclusive nightclub, the armed smuggler made his pitch to a client, 2.5 million euros, for enough radioactive cesium to contaminate several city blocks.
[01:49:13.741 --> 01:49:21.324]  It was earlier this year, and the two men were plotting their deal at an unlikely spot, the Terrace of Cocoa Prive,
[01:49:22.737 --> 01:49:26.523]  A dance club and sushi bar in the capital of Moldovia.
[01:49:28.052 --> 01:49:31.774]  You can make a dirty bomb, which would be perfect for the Islamic State, the smuggler said.
[01:49:31.794 --> 01:49:35.536]  If you have a connection with them, the businesses will go smoothly.
[01:49:36.136 --> 01:49:39.718]  But the smuggler wasn't sure the client was for real.
[01:49:40.319 --> 01:49:41.739]  And he was right to worry.
[01:49:41.779 --> 01:49:47.963]  The client was an informant and it took 20 meetings to persuade him that he was authentic Islamic State representative.
[01:49:48.383 --> 01:49:53.206]  Eventually, the two men exchanged cash for a sample in a sting operation that landed him in jail.
[01:49:53.466 --> 01:49:54.766]  And this is the big national news.
[01:49:54.806 --> 01:49:55.547]  The point is,
[01:49:56.755 --> 01:50:01.079]  That ISIS did say six months ago they'd infiltrate Europe through immigrant waves.
[01:50:01.419 --> 01:50:04.422]  They did it, and Europe's answer is to say, come on in.
[01:50:06.304 --> 01:50:17.154]  The French president, Hollande sauce, French Hollande, Hollande, I always say it wrong, Muslim rift threatens total war.
[01:50:20.293 --> 01:50:24.316]  And we'll go over that story when we come back from break.
[01:50:24.336 --> 01:50:27.358]  We have the clip of him saying it, and again we have Hillary making the big joke.
[01:50:28.098 --> 01:50:34.162]  Then we're going to get to thousands of drug inmates approved for early prison release.
[01:50:35.023 --> 01:50:38.786]  So I've got to say that there's some good news going on there.
[01:50:39.906 --> 01:50:42.948]  Because we shouldn't have non-violent offenders in jail, in my view.
[01:50:43.889 --> 01:50:45.570]  If it's victimless crimes, that is.
[01:50:46.010 --> 01:50:48.612]  The Tactical Firearm Trade Show, the gun grabbers don't want you to see.
[01:50:48.652 --> 01:50:50.673]  That's a video up on Infowars.com.
[01:50:50.693 --> 01:50:52.234]  Joe Big's out there covering that.
[01:50:52.254 --> 01:50:53.755]  That's not really the big news yet, though.
[01:50:54.135 --> 01:50:58.338]  Delta Force used IEDs for secret assassinations during the Iraq War.
[01:50:59.259 --> 01:51:00.380]  We'll be breaking that down.
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:05.043]  We'll get into the latest on politics with Trump, saying he doesn't like Fox News, but likes Drudge.
[01:51:05.903 --> 01:51:08.945]  And we will continue with the economic news, and then your phone calls.
[01:51:09.206 --> 01:51:09.646]  Stay with us.
[01:51:11.908 --> 01:51:13.430]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[01:51:13.850 --> 01:51:15.832]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[01:51:16.372 --> 01:51:19.996]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[01:51:20.236 --> 01:51:28.705]  Ten years ago I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[01:51:29.065 --> 01:51:32.328]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:36.291]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[01:51:36.331 --> 01:51:40.953]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[01:51:41.694 --> 01:51:45.936]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[01:51:46.637 --> 01:51:49.438]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[01:51:49.778 --> 01:51:52.080]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:59.104]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallets, sleeves, or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.

[01:54:47.555 --> 01:54:52.381]  Here's Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail, and she tells her minions what to say.
[01:54:52.441 --> 01:54:53.242]  It's highly scripted.
[01:54:53.963 --> 01:54:55.865]  And so this is directly from her.
[01:54:55.945 --> 01:54:57.627]  This is her view.
[01:54:57.647 --> 01:54:59.028]  This is what she's going to feed the public.
[01:54:59.349 --> 01:55:01.011]  This is the incredible criminal arrogance.
[01:55:02.173 --> 01:55:11.759]  I think we're starting to really see an impact across the state of Iowa, and especially here in Muscatine, as we continue to educate voters about what the real issues are.
[01:55:12.399 --> 01:55:17.002]  Set aside all that hoo-ha about emails and this and Benghazi.
[01:55:17.782 --> 01:55:18.483]  Who cares?
[01:55:19.223 --> 01:55:22.165]  I want to know what tomorrow's about, not what yesterday's about.
[01:55:24.215 --> 01:55:37.120]  So this is the criminal arrogance and then we've got these campaign ads that she's running where she's like, they're attacking me because I want to help you and I love you and you know, I'm fighting against the evil rich people and I'm not an insider.
[01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:39.982]  In fact, we've got one of those ads right here.
[01:55:40.062 --> 01:55:40.362]  Here it is.
[01:55:41.718 --> 01:55:43.219]  The Republicans finally admit it.
[01:55:43.479 --> 01:55:50.723]  Republican Kevin McCarthy saying the committee investigating Benghazi and Clinton's emails was created to destroy her candidacy.
[01:55:51.144 --> 01:55:53.625]  Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?
[01:55:53.965 --> 01:55:57.247]  But we put together a Benghazi special committee.
[01:55:57.407 --> 01:55:58.648]  What are her numbers today?
[01:55:58.908 --> 01:56:03.071]  Republicans have spent millions attacking Hillary because she's fighting for everything they oppose.
[01:56:03.491 --> 01:56:05.572]  From affordable health care to equal pay.
[01:56:06.273 --> 01:56:09.095]  She'll never stop fighting for you and the Republicans know it.
[01:56:09.295 --> 01:56:11.196]  I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
[01:56:12.298 --> 01:56:16.621]  Well, I thought we got the free health care, then it doubled and tripled in price, and it's collapsing.
[01:56:17.642 --> 01:56:30.171]  Man, I watch these people when I go to a doctor's clinic a couple times a year, and I see, especially these Democrats, old white women, old black women, you name it, and they get up to the counter and they go, excuse me, I just came in here a couple months ago, this is when it was all happening a few years ago.
[01:56:30.191 --> 01:56:37.016]  They'd say, ma'am, this is Obamacare, you can see right here, it actually has a fee there, and that's what your insurance company did that, ma'am, we're sorry.
[01:56:37.777 --> 01:56:40.499]  And they'll just walk out like they got hit by a Mack truck.
[01:56:42.276 --> 01:56:44.317]  Oh, but now Hillary's going to fight for it.
[01:56:45.297 --> 01:56:46.938]  The Rockefeller plan from the 50s?
[01:56:47.418 --> 01:56:50.299]  The exact same plan they now got that the Republicans wrote?
[01:56:52.939 --> 01:56:55.440]  Oh, the Republicans are fighting against your free health care?
[01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:55.900]  Give me a break.
[01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:58.721]  Republican leadership works hand-in-glove with them.
[01:56:59.061 --> 01:57:00.822]  They're just battling over who gets to be in power.
[01:57:02.202 --> 01:57:07.064]  Now, there are a lot of good Tea Party people lower down, and those are the people that are really under attack by the establishment.
[01:57:12.742 --> 01:57:16.884]  Before I go any further, I want to give the number out to take your phone calls in the next hour.
[01:57:17.624 --> 01:57:19.325]  It's 800-259-9231.
[01:57:19.945 --> 01:57:22.126]  And also, that's for first-time callers today, 800-259-9231.
[01:57:22.166 --> 01:57:28.209]  And I know we do have callers there on the board as well.
[01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:34.151]  Briefly, we're running three big specials right now that end next Wednesday.
[01:57:34.171 --> 01:57:35.472]  In fact, one of these ends Sunday.
[01:57:35.492 --> 01:57:38.033]  The other two end next Wednesday because they're new.
[01:57:38.053 --> 01:57:39.694]  20% Off Prostagard at Infowarslife.com.
[01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:51.251]  It has saw palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols, zinc, vitamin D3, selenium and copper, all organic, all tested to the highest standards, all the details at Infowarslife.com.
[01:57:51.811 --> 01:57:59.860]  We also have ProPure, G2, their whole systems, 10% off promo code WATER, we always have that, but free shipping.
[01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:02.140]  That's a big deal on a big item like this.
[01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:03.461]  These are the best filters.
[01:58:03.681 --> 01:58:04.461]  Very affordable.
[01:58:04.861 --> 01:58:08.042]  InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:58:08.682 --> 01:58:11.202]  Absolutely a super deal running through next Wednesday.
[01:58:11.222 --> 01:58:16.043]  InfoWars Select running through next Wednesday.
[01:58:16.103 --> 01:58:17.163]  That's just private labeled.
[01:58:17.223 --> 01:58:18.084]  Super high quality.
[01:58:18.164 --> 01:58:19.044]  My Patriot Supply.
[01:58:19.084 --> 01:58:19.904]  We sell it as well.
[01:58:19.944 --> 01:58:22.924]  Their entire spectrum discounted at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:23.285 --> 01:58:25.405]  You can get InfoWars Select
[01:58:26.938 --> 01:58:28.239]  10% off.
[01:58:29.119 --> 01:58:37.042]  Now, that's not as good as the introductory deal, but it's already the lowest price it's going to be regularly, so this is an even bigger discount than we can normally offer.
[01:58:37.923 --> 01:58:39.143]  That runs through next Wednesday.
[01:58:39.163 --> 01:58:42.864]  Now is the time to get storable food, in my view, and it helps fund this operation.
[01:58:43.245 --> 01:58:46.266]  Infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:46.286 --> 01:58:47.866]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:55.771 --> 01:58:57.961]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:59:00.723 --> 01:59:01.263]  I want more candy!
[01:59:01.283 --> 01:59:02.383]  I want more video games!
[01:59:02.423 --> 01:59:02.563]  Mine!
[01:59:02.623 --> 01:59:02.803]  Mine!
[01:59:03.144 --> 01:59:03.644]  Mine!
[01:59:03.944 --> 01:59:13.346]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:59:13.686 --> 01:59:16.246]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:59:16.386 --> 01:59:19.727]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:59:19.927 --> 01:59:25.948]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[01:59:26.268 --> 01:59:30.569]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:31.469]  I think so.
[02:00:03.214 --> 02:00:05.824]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:16.806 --> 02:00:20.990]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:21.651 --> 02:00:22.452]  You want answers?
[02:00:23.233 --> 02:00:24.134]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.774 --> 02:00:28.378]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.979 --> 02:00:33.023]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.824 --> 02:00:39.245]  Alright, I'm going to start going to your calls.
[02:00:39.405 --> 02:00:44.868]  Lucas, Evan, Nathaniel, Brandon and others, 800-259-9231.
[02:00:44.908 --> 02:00:47.950]  I'll intersperse it with a lot of world news, politics, science and health and more.
[02:00:48.690 --> 02:00:50.371]  I mention this, but this is really a big deal.
[02:00:50.771 --> 02:00:52.712]  New York Governor Cuomo, what a gangster.
[02:00:52.952 --> 02:00:54.613]  You're pro-life, pro-gun, get out of the state.
[02:00:54.653 --> 02:00:55.134]  I'm serious.
[02:00:55.914 --> 02:00:57.374]  I mean, Don Carleone.
[02:00:58.055 --> 02:01:00.395]  Don't go along with the stereotypes there, bro.
[02:01:01.295 --> 02:01:04.896]  Cuomo wants Dems to shut down government over Second Amendment.
[02:01:05.016 --> 02:01:07.597]  All of their political issues are blather, Cuomo said.
[02:01:07.617 --> 02:01:08.017]  That's right.
[02:01:08.137 --> 02:01:09.077]  Take our guns.
[02:01:09.717 --> 02:01:10.377]  That's key.
[02:01:10.477 --> 02:01:11.318]  Get our guns.
[02:01:11.718 --> 02:01:14.718]  Disarm the prey so you can run your capo op.
[02:01:15.719 --> 02:01:20.680]  Supporter introduces Hillary in Iowa declaring who cares.
[02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:21.600]  I already played this clip.
[02:01:24.301 --> 02:01:27.104]  About email and Benghazi scandals to dovetail it with this.
[02:01:27.484 --> 02:01:33.411]  Hillary's IT staff worried they were being asked to cover up shady sh-you-know-what-t.
[02:01:34.452 --> 02:01:37.555]  We're going to be getting more into that, but that is just, that is huge.
[02:01:37.595 --> 02:01:45.884]  Employees at the Denver-based IT company that Hillary Clinton hired in 2013 to manage her private email network expressed concern they were covering up some shady bleepy.
[02:01:47.691 --> 02:01:48.651]  Some shady Hillary.
[02:01:49.391 --> 02:01:52.512]  That according to a letter sent Monday by Wisconsin U.S.
[02:01:52.532 --> 02:02:00.734]  Senator John, Ron Johnson to Austin McCord, the CEO of Datto Inc., a Connecticut-based computer cloud storage company.
[02:02:00.774 --> 02:02:02.154]  It's all coming out.
[02:02:02.194 --> 02:02:05.255]  So she's got to become president to purge everybody to cover it up.
[02:02:05.295 --> 02:02:09.016]  She's got to get the power to continue the bubble, the criminal bubble.
[02:02:09.376 --> 02:02:10.296]  Criminals run bubbles.
[02:02:11.657 --> 02:02:13.657]  And if you're going to commit one crime, why not commit a thousand?
[02:02:13.897 --> 02:02:14.737]  Why not commit a million?
[02:02:15.097 --> 02:02:17.098]  Don't commit one murder, why not commit a billion?
[02:02:19.221 --> 02:02:22.664]  So, just the satisfaction this criminal has.
[02:02:22.684 --> 02:02:24.305]  Look at this photo of her of your TV viewer.
[02:02:24.325 --> 02:02:28.528]  I mean, I have to get where I can just handle to look at her and not get upset.
[02:02:28.588 --> 02:02:28.968]  I love it.
[02:02:29.008 --> 02:02:30.829]  I love looking at that cow patty.
[02:02:31.950 --> 02:02:34.432]  And I shouldn't sit there and talk like that, but I gotta have a little bit of fun.
[02:02:35.333 --> 02:02:38.235]  Just look at that satisfied criminal smugness.
[02:02:38.835 --> 02:02:38.995]  Ugh!
[02:02:39.856 --> 02:02:41.017]  Disgusting warthog.
[02:02:42.672 --> 02:02:45.853]  I've got a lot of intellectual things to say about Hillary, but I'll be honest, I'm sick of it.
[02:02:45.873 --> 02:02:46.694]  The U.S.
[02:02:46.734 --> 02:02:51.295]  bombing of a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Afghanistan was no accident, it was a target.
[02:02:51.315 --> 02:02:53.256]  I'm going to get to that after we go to some calls.
[02:02:53.756 --> 02:02:56.837]  And more on France's presence as Muslim, where it threatens total war.
[02:02:56.957 --> 02:02:58.138]  I've been mentioning that, but that's big.
[02:02:58.718 --> 02:03:00.999]  Right now, Lucas in Arizona, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:03:01.019 --> 02:03:03.940]  Hi, are you there, Alex?
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:04.480]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:06.241 --> 02:03:10.402]  Hi, I just wanted to make two quick points.
[02:03:10.883 --> 02:03:11.583]  So yesterday,
[02:03:12.173 --> 02:03:23.001]  Twitter launched its moment, I guess, I don't know what you would call it, but it's pretty much like Facebook mentions.
[02:03:24.442 --> 02:03:38.532]  So, what it was is Hillary Clinton was the first topic, just happened to be, so I click on it, scroll through, one of the headlines is, Hillary Clinton, if we can't decide mutually
[02:03:39.412 --> 02:03:42.133]  I will make an executive order to take the gun.
[02:03:42.154 --> 02:03:46.576]  So that already was just a blow in the face.
[02:03:46.656 --> 02:03:47.316]  Like, wow.
[02:03:50.818 --> 02:03:51.639]  Keep going, you're right.
[02:03:53.459 --> 02:03:54.400]  Okay, and another one.
[02:03:54.660 --> 02:04:01.984]  I just wanted to ask if you've ever heard about a book called The Giver.
[02:04:02.304 --> 02:04:03.285]  It's by Lois Lowry.
[02:04:04.625 --> 02:04:18.991]  And pretty much, I, my sixth grade teacher read it to me in the class, and pretty much when you talk about this, like, society of political correctness and whatnot, this book just comes to mind.
[02:04:19.592 --> 02:04:21.472]  All it is... No, I went and saw the movie.
[02:04:21.572 --> 02:04:25.154]  It's absolutely what they're actually, it's an allegory for what they're trying to establish.
[02:04:25.174 --> 02:04:34.158]  I just, every time you talk, it just blows my mind on how similar it sounds to that book, and like,
[02:04:34.787 --> 02:04:42.354]  Already when I was young, because I'm 19 now, so I'm not like... Sure, I never read the book, but that's art imitating life.
[02:04:43.255 --> 02:04:44.256]  That's what they want to build.
[02:04:44.516 --> 02:04:45.877]  But we already are all givers.
[02:04:47.178 --> 02:04:48.139]  Some more than others.
[02:04:48.179 --> 02:04:52.663]  We already don't have the knowledge of everybody, but we have it of our ancestors.
[02:04:53.084 --> 02:04:54.105]  We have it of the species.
[02:04:55.896 --> 02:05:08.942]  And so that's why no matter how much dumbing down they try to engage in, our bodies are so much more powerful, our souls so much more powerful, than the system that we're basically like insects they try to exterminate just mutate around it.
[02:05:08.962 --> 02:05:10.102]  They're gonna make us more powerful.
[02:05:10.763 --> 02:05:18.266]  Presidential candidates today strategize over every last detail of a candidate's image, especially an identity candidate like Hillary.
[02:05:18.566 --> 02:05:22.188]  How important is it for there to be a woman president in the United States?
[02:05:22.970 --> 02:05:29.241]  National Journal has pointed out that candidates now view soundtracks as a key part of that carefully crafted image.
[02:05:30.162 --> 02:05:34.449]  So, maybe Hillary should choose a campaign song that plays against type.
[02:05:34.590 --> 02:05:35.772]  You know, Humble.
[02:05:38.615 --> 02:05:44.477]  Hillary has paid a consulting firm $9,000 to create a soundtrack for her campaign.
[02:05:45.138 --> 02:05:47.779]  I just don't think people would believe this song, though.
[02:05:48.459 --> 02:05:52.901]  She's being abandoned by unions, by multinational corporate donors who are worried.
[02:05:52.921 --> 02:05:58.323]  44% of her Twitter followers, 1.4 million, are fake.
[02:05:58.923 --> 02:06:01.684]  Maybe her campaign theme should be... Help!
[02:06:02.385 --> 02:06:03.445]  I need somebody!
[02:06:03.505 --> 02:06:04.205]  Help!
[02:06:04.565 --> 02:06:06.166]  Not just anybody!

[02:08:24.967 --> 02:08:29.029]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:08:29.570 --> 02:08:33.512]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:37.134 --> 02:08:52.763]  There's an article up on Infowars.com that links to mainstream Italian news where with a straight face they're now having Catholic priests, bishops and others that have been caught with children and others coming out and defending it saying, what's wrong with love-seeking children?
[02:08:53.587 --> 02:08:55.108]  See, it's all coming out now.
[02:08:56.568 --> 02:09:01.310]  Coming out with the Drano in the eyes, coming out with the trans-abled, coming out with your children belong to us.
[02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:02.710]  It is just crazy.
[02:09:02.730 --> 02:09:03.551]  I'm going to get into that.
[02:09:04.671 --> 02:09:09.993]  Francis Hollande says Muslim rift threatens total war.
[02:09:10.993 --> 02:09:15.215]  The Prime Minister comes out and declares war on radical Islam.
[02:09:17.162 --> 02:09:18.383]  You guys print me that one, thanks.
[02:09:19.044 --> 02:09:20.925]  That ties in with Muslim Merkel.
[02:09:21.285 --> 02:09:23.507]  German TV image causes outrage.
[02:09:23.847 --> 02:09:28.231]  They're accusing them of Islamophobia and criminal charges are being investigated.
[02:09:28.691 --> 02:09:34.756]  So you can't lampoon Merkel and show her in a burqa.
[02:09:34.776 --> 02:09:35.496]  I mean, why not?
[02:09:35.516 --> 02:09:38.859]  Of course, that's not even a... that's a conservative garb there.
[02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:43.683]  We should, uh... Why not just show her here?
[02:09:43.723 --> 02:09:44.864]  We have a marker.
[02:09:44.904 --> 02:09:45.304]  We got one?
[02:09:45.344 --> 02:09:45.644]  Is this a...
[02:09:46.644 --> 02:09:47.305]  Is this a crime here?
[02:09:47.325 --> 02:09:48.708]  I mean, this is what she'd actually look like.
[02:09:48.728 --> 02:09:50.050]  There.
[02:09:50.070 --> 02:09:52.173]  There you go.
[02:09:52.193 --> 02:09:52.955]  We're watching on TV.
[02:09:53.135 --> 02:09:54.738]  Just... There you go.
[02:09:54.758 --> 02:09:57.102]  That's maybe a little vent for her eyes there.
[02:09:57.122 --> 02:09:57.522]  There you go.
[02:09:58.644 --> 02:09:59.005]  There you go.
[02:10:00.777 --> 02:10:03.600]  I mean, I'm not for that.
[02:10:03.620 --> 02:10:04.300]  I'm not being extreme.
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:05.061]  I'm not the one doing it.
[02:10:05.121 --> 02:10:07.203]  Oh, but I'll be attacked for this.
[02:10:07.223 --> 02:10:08.564]  You can believe it.
[02:10:20.299 --> 02:10:21.980]  But I mean, let's actually... here.
[02:10:22.821 --> 02:10:25.223]  And then ISIS has promised to cut Obama's head off.
[02:10:25.243 --> 02:10:31.509]  We know they're bringing ISIS in, so... I mean, if you really wanted to go all the way, they would say that, you know, there'd be like a big sword.
[02:10:32.049 --> 02:10:35.792]  You know, a big... big sword.
[02:10:35.872 --> 02:10:40.036]  And then like the cartoons on Bugs Bunny, where he goes, HASSAN!
[02:10:40.416 --> 02:10:40.877]  CHOP!
[02:10:42.999 --> 02:10:45.561]  Can we... can we find that on Looney Tunes?
[02:10:45.921 --> 02:10:47.743]  By the way, did you guys find the Skeksi I wanted?
[02:10:49.799 --> 02:10:51.742]  Cue that up before I get into the serious news.
[02:10:52.884 --> 02:10:55.909]  Actually folks, Hillary is not sick.
[02:10:56.470 --> 02:11:00.656]  She doesn't have six months to live like some folks are getting ready to report.
[02:11:01.277 --> 02:11:01.978]  Was I supposed to say that?
[02:11:03.516 --> 02:11:04.236]  She's fine.
[02:11:04.476 --> 02:11:05.317]  She's doing great.
[02:11:05.857 --> 02:11:08.418]  In fact, this was her just yesterday.
[02:11:09.178 --> 02:11:26.063]  She was on the campaign trail, but she dropped by a friend's house and was having just some cocktails, some tea, some crumpets with some of the friends, and they were discussing someone else running for office and taking the scepter from her, but she stood up to him in a very, very dramatic way.
[02:11:26.223 --> 02:11:28.144]  If you're not a TV viewer, I will
[02:11:29.464 --> 02:11:34.008]  narrate some of this, but it's just a plush Democratic facility house.
[02:11:34.329 --> 02:11:37.692]  You know, the Democrats on average would have six times the money of Republicans in Congress.
[02:11:38.192 --> 02:11:39.994]  Filthy rich off all their insider deals.
[02:11:40.054 --> 02:11:40.715]  I think it's wonderful.
[02:11:41.475 --> 02:11:43.757]  But they class warfare all day against anyone who has money.
[02:11:44.758 --> 02:11:47.541]  So, here you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:48.222 --> 02:11:53.306]  This is the amazing footage smuggled out by
[02:11:54.207 --> 02:11:59.415]  The incredible folks at Project Veritas, James O'Keefe, this is the footage.
[02:11:59.956 --> 02:12:01.798]  And you're going to see Joe Biden.
[02:12:03.289 --> 02:12:12.854]  Joe Biden discussing with Obama the fact that who's going to have the dynasty, the Obamas or the Clintons, and they're marching in to see her on a couch.
[02:12:12.914 --> 02:12:26.920]  She's not sick, but she was laying on a pillowed couch just relaxing her feet from being out on the road and shaking thousands of hands in between saying, who cares about Benghazi, who cares about emails, ha ha ha ha ha.
[02:12:26.961 --> 02:12:27.961]  So here is Hillary
[02:12:28.021 --> 02:12:32.284]  Hillary Clinton again laying on the couch with the Democratic supporters that love her.
[02:12:32.604 --> 02:12:33.384]  They're beautiful people.
[02:12:33.424 --> 02:12:34.745]  Some of her girlfriends are there as well.
[02:12:35.105 --> 02:12:37.707]  You can tell the girls by the little bows in their hair.
[02:12:37.747 --> 02:12:39.448]  So let's go ahead and go to this footage.
[02:12:39.488 --> 02:12:43.370]  You can see it if you're a radio listener at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.711]  Here it is.
[02:12:57.753 --> 02:12:59.274]  Guys, you found the wrong one.
[02:12:59.954 --> 02:13:01.914]  That's in some foreign language.
[02:13:02.154 --> 02:13:02.614]  I'll do it.
[02:13:02.734 --> 02:13:03.174]  It's okay.
[02:13:04.835 --> 02:13:06.935]  This was on French TV.
[02:13:07.055 --> 02:13:09.656]  It already aired in France before my show, okay?
[02:13:09.676 --> 02:13:10.296]  It's not exclusive.
[02:13:10.336 --> 02:13:10.716]  I'm sorry.
[02:13:11.136 --> 02:13:12.017]  Go ahead and turn it off.
[02:13:12.777 --> 02:13:13.937]  Yeah, guys, you want it in English.
[02:13:13.977 --> 02:13:15.677]  You want the death of the Skeksy Emperor.
[02:13:15.697 --> 02:13:19.858]  I was gonna come double-check it during a break, but I figured... This is real.
[02:13:19.938 --> 02:13:22.719]  Can we get the English translation that James O'Keefe shot, please?
[02:13:23.979 --> 02:13:24.940]  It was in English.
[02:13:24.980 --> 02:13:25.940]  We don't need a translation.
[02:13:27.625 --> 02:13:33.188]  My gosh, I cannot- I have gone further than anybody that I'm aware of in American history.
[02:13:33.228 --> 02:13:42.352]  Now, that's not a long history because we haven't had emails that long, but as long as we've had them, I've gone longer and farther to try to be as transparent as possible.
[02:13:42.412 --> 02:13:43.453]  Nobody else has done that.
[02:13:43.973 --> 02:13:45.654]  Okay, do you have the English version?
[02:13:47.335 --> 02:13:48.095]  Okay, I mean, I'll do it.
[02:13:48.115 --> 02:13:48.495]  I'll show you.
[02:13:48.555 --> 02:13:49.336]  It's all over the place.
[02:13:51.254 --> 02:13:55.977]  So we have the music.
[02:13:57.738 --> 02:14:00.019]  In fairness, I said get the club, but they just got a foreign language one.
[02:14:00.039 --> 02:14:00.980]  I didn't go check it.
[02:14:05.682 --> 02:14:11.185]  And then Joe Biden reaches for the scepter and something really important happens.
[02:14:11.666 --> 02:14:13.887]  You can get it off movie clips too, guys, from Really HD.
[02:14:14.267 --> 02:14:16.809]  OK, let's go to another caller then, I guess, and then
[02:14:18.609 --> 02:14:19.509]  You know what, let's get serious.
[02:14:19.549 --> 02:14:20.550]  We won't play the clip.
[02:14:20.570 --> 02:14:21.610]  Let's just move away from that now.
[02:14:22.410 --> 02:14:23.231]  Let's continue here.
[02:14:23.251 --> 02:14:24.391]  Let's get into the serious news.
[02:14:25.551 --> 02:14:30.153]  Russian jets intercept US Predator drones over Syria, officials say.
[02:14:30.653 --> 02:14:46.859]  Russian fighter jets shadowed US Predator drones on at least three separate occasions high above Syria since the start of Russia's air campaign last week, according to two US officials briefed on the latest intelligence from the region.
[02:14:49.551 --> 02:14:52.513]  The first time it happened, we thought the Russians got lucky.
[02:14:52.573 --> 02:14:54.795]  Then it happened two more times, said one official.
[02:14:55.495 --> 02:15:06.843]  Both officials, not servants, said that the incidents took place over ISIS-controlled Syria, including its de facto headquarters in Raqqa, as well as along the Turkish-Syrian border.
[02:15:07.964 --> 02:15:12.848]  Another occurred in the northwest, near the highly contested city of Aleppo.
[02:15:13.871 --> 02:15:14.572]  That's the main battle.
[02:15:14.632 --> 02:15:17.414]  It's kind of like the Stalingrad or the Leningrad there of World War II.
[02:15:17.915 --> 02:15:18.355]  Aleppo.
[02:15:19.156 --> 02:15:19.436]  The U.S.
[02:15:19.456 --> 02:15:22.999]  military's MQ-1 Predator drone is not a stealth aircraft.
[02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:27.443]  It is easy to see a predator on radar, said the official.
[02:15:28.324 --> 02:15:31.407]  The Russians have not attempted to shoot down any of the U.S.
[02:15:31.427 --> 02:15:40.155]  drones, but instead have flown intercept tracks, a doctrinal term meaning that Russians flew close enough to make their presence felt, according to one official.
[02:15:42.472 --> 02:15:45.755]  It should just be one airman or one... No, it's official, official, official.
[02:15:45.775 --> 02:15:46.555]  We're official, we're official.
[02:15:47.396 --> 02:15:54.061]  One other official, official, official, official said the Russians flew very close but did not impede the drone flight.
[02:15:55.362 --> 02:15:57.904]  You're not invited in under international law to Syria.
[02:15:58.005 --> 02:16:00.206]  You sent in proxy armies to murder everybody.
[02:16:00.446 --> 02:16:01.928]  Now you think we're so politically ignorant?
[02:16:01.968 --> 02:16:02.788]  Everybody doesn't know that.
[02:16:03.349 --> 02:16:05.651]  You run ISIS, you run Al-Qaeda, the Pentagon knows it.
[02:16:05.911 --> 02:16:06.551]  They don't like it.
[02:16:06.611 --> 02:16:07.212]  It's all come out.
[02:16:07.953 --> 02:16:10.755]  Because we're not just going to sit here and let you control the narrative.
[02:16:12.008 --> 02:16:16.310]  Meanwhile, I mentioned this earlier, Daily Mail, we will cut your filthy head.
[02:16:16.931 --> 02:16:25.175]  Child ISIS Jihad taunts dog of Rome, Obama, to submit to the caliphate or die in direct video threat.
[02:16:25.555 --> 02:16:33.460]  Probably produced by the White House or a subsidiary, and this has come out, they've done things like this, totally fake, you know, with eight foot tall ISIS people taking folks to be beheaded.
[02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:36.101]  It looks like Stanley Kubrick produced it, it's so well done.
[02:16:36.941 --> 02:16:41.404]  This is to make him look like he's being tough on Islamic radicals, two domestic idiots.
[02:16:44.107 --> 02:17:02.636]  Continuing here, I always get disgusted by racial stereotypes and racial comments spewed and pushed incessantly by racist black people and then media statements by mainly white people that blacks can't be racist.
[02:17:04.657 --> 02:17:07.518]  And this is a real culture of enslavement that they've been pushing
[02:17:09.352 --> 02:17:10.473]  To say the least.
[02:17:30.302 --> 02:17:40.050]  That the Klan and others put out to suppress black people and now blacks have accepted it all because they follow MTV and the very culture that wants to destroy them.
[02:17:42.713 --> 02:17:46.476]  I mean, you don't think Sumner Redstone's outdating black people, do you?
[02:17:46.576 --> 02:17:48.738]  Or, you know, the Clippers owner, do you?
[02:17:48.818 --> 02:17:48.918]  No.
[02:17:49.955 --> 02:17:55.198]  But, they're sure pushing all this death culture on black folks, and everybody else picks it up thinking it's cool.
[02:17:56.099 --> 02:17:57.900]  It's like picking up a hand grenade and pulling the pin.
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:07.105]  University of Pennsylvania professor, Anita Butler, called presidential candidate Ben Carson a coon.
[02:18:08.846 --> 02:18:13.469]  I've never even heard a white person use that term, but I've heard a lot of black people use it, for claiming that
[02:18:14.434 --> 02:18:17.555]  People have the right to display Confederate flags on private property.
[02:18:17.875 --> 02:18:19.195]  Well, I mean, that's just a fact.
[02:18:19.935 --> 02:18:29.618]  You can fly swastikas, you can fly Chinese flags, you can fly McDonald's flag, you can fly Easter Bunny flag, a gopher flag, a caddyshack flag.
[02:18:29.638 --> 02:18:30.238]  I actually have one.
[02:18:31.379 --> 02:18:34.359]  I mean, yes, that's because I'm racist against gophers.
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:37.520]  Kill all the gophers, I'd go to jail.
[02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:39.021]  The gophers!
[02:18:41.949 --> 02:18:55.242]  It continues, if only there was a Kuna of the Year award, Professor Butler, man these people push racism, tweeted in response to another tweet linking to a Sports Illustrated article in which Carson was quoted defending the right of NASCAR fans to fly Confederate flags.
[02:18:55.262 --> 02:18:58.806]  Well that's because he's educated, not an ignoramus and not a class warfare person.
[02:18:59.186 --> 02:19:02.490]  He knows the Confederate flag means a hundred different things.
[02:19:03.922 --> 02:19:11.964]  I mean, if somebody appropriates Doc Martens, who's a Nazi, does that mean someone wearing punk rock boots is a Nazi?
[02:19:12.004 --> 02:19:12.164]  No.
[02:19:12.564 --> 02:19:14.164]  Most people wearing them aren't a Nazi.
[02:19:18.165 --> 02:19:18.645]  Oh, man.
[02:19:19.145 --> 02:19:22.626]  You know, when I was in high school, I wore all sorts of cowboy boots, tennis shoes.
[02:19:23.266 --> 02:19:24.107]  I was ignorant.
[02:19:24.167 --> 02:19:25.267]  I heard some punk rock music.
[02:19:25.287 --> 02:19:26.047]  I liked some of it.
[02:19:26.087 --> 02:19:26.927]  Didn't like most of it.
[02:19:26.967 --> 02:19:30.268]  But one time I was at the shopping mall and bought a black pair of Doc Martens.
[02:19:31.107 --> 02:19:34.189]  And I had, like, cute punk girls coming up to me wanting to go on a date.
[02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:37.691]  I had women that liked it.
[02:19:37.711 --> 02:19:40.352]  You know, I say girls, like 16-year-olds when I was 16.
[02:19:41.613 --> 02:19:44.454]  But I also had, like, white supremacists coming over, you know, saying, you know, are you 88?
[02:19:44.914 --> 02:19:45.715]  Do you howl Hitler?
[02:19:46.135 --> 02:19:49.137]  And I also had, like, other skater people pull up and go, are you a racist?
[02:19:49.157 --> 02:19:50.157]  We're going to beat your ass.
[02:19:50.177 --> 02:19:50.918]  You know, stuff like that.
[02:19:51.678 --> 02:19:53.741]  Just not knowing what these symbols mean.
[02:19:54.242 --> 02:19:56.404]  So that's all the political correctness around that.
[02:19:56.745 --> 02:19:59.909]  But then meanwhile, you've got black people parading around.
[02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:02.773]  I was going off the Doc Martens because they can mean a lot of different things.
[02:20:03.194 --> 02:20:05.236]  And just because somebody's ignorant about it doesn't mean you gotta ban it.
[02:20:05.417 --> 02:20:06.498]  It's like banning Doc Martens.
[02:20:06.518 --> 02:20:09.162]  You know, some schools ban Doc Martens in school.
[02:20:11.109 --> 02:20:20.435]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day, but growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.
[02:20:20.536 --> 02:20:24.839]  The solution is DefenderShield, the most effective mobile radiation shielding ever developed.

[02:20:42.007 --> 02:20:43.508]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:20:43.828 --> 02:20:45.109]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:20:45.469 --> 02:20:47.791]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:20:48.292 --> 02:20:50.133]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:20:50.593 --> 02:20:54.636]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:20:55.097 --> 02:20:58.800]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:02.483]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:21:02.823 --> 02:21:03.123]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:21:03.143 --> 02:21:04.564]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:12.740]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[02:21:13.161 --> 02:21:15.141]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[02:21:15.701 --> 02:21:19.322]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[02:21:19.562 --> 02:21:28.025]  Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[02:21:28.365 --> 02:21:31.646]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[02:21:32.526 --> 02:21:35.610]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[02:21:35.670 --> 02:21:40.275]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[02:21:41.036 --> 02:21:45.260]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[02:21:45.961 --> 02:21:48.744]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[02:21:49.105 --> 02:21:51.367]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[02:21:52.208 --> 02:21:58.454]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallets, sleeves, or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.
[02:21:59.234 --> 02:22:04.459]  You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model, you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[02:22:04.839 --> 02:22:06.561]  It is as though the protection is free.

[02:22:10.231 --> 02:22:12.393]  All whey protein powders are not created equal.
[02:22:12.693 --> 02:22:17.457]  Fresh liquid whey has been used for hundreds of years to restore health to the sick and youth to the aging.
[02:22:17.857 --> 02:22:21.640]  Why is it that no one reports these benefits from today's whey protein powders?
[02:22:21.801 --> 02:22:29.387]  It is because they are all processed with heat or chemicals, which damages the protein and amino acids, making them allergy-causing or toxic to your body.
[02:22:29.767 --> 02:22:30.528]  We're good to go!
[02:22:49.099 --> 02:22:50.240]  Making it more affordable.

[02:23:11.519 --> 02:23:19.264]  Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day and the home security industry wants you to believe that's your only option.
[02:23:19.524 --> 02:23:24.708]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[02:23:25.008 --> 02:23:29.611]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[02:23:29.911 --> 02:23:33.133]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.
[02:23:33.413 --> 02:23:35.494]  But there's a better way to protect your home.
[02:23:35.855 --> 02:23:37.416]  SimpliSafe Home Security.

[02:24:16.441 --> 02:24:21.105]  Infowars.com is getting about three times the traffic it normally gets.
[02:24:21.345 --> 02:24:24.207]  Millions of people are pounding the servers right now.
[02:24:24.788 --> 02:24:29.632]  But there is a paradox, obviously from the huge Drudge interview yesterday that I'm still trying to analyze.
[02:24:29.692 --> 02:24:31.273]  It was so informative, so powerful.
[02:24:32.034 --> 02:24:32.895]  Historic, really.
[02:24:33.355 --> 02:24:34.876]  He doesn't do a lot of those interviews.
[02:24:34.916 --> 02:24:36.097]  He is the king of internet.
[02:24:36.898 --> 02:24:42.090]  Uh, media news, news period pretty much when it comes to being able to put a story out there and get attention to it.
[02:24:43.013 --> 02:24:45.017]  Uh, and he gave us a big exclusive like 45 minute long.
[02:24:46.457 --> 02:24:47.278]  Interview yesterday.
[02:24:47.298 --> 02:24:49.260]  I know we've got callers.
[02:24:50.221 --> 02:24:54.445]  Lucas and Eva and Nathaniel and Brandon and Phil.
[02:24:54.465 --> 02:24:55.466]  We're going to get to all of you.
[02:24:55.486 --> 02:25:03.454]  But in the interest of time, I want to have a little bit of fun right now on political correctness, and I'll go to your calls right when we start the next segment, because it's longer.
[02:25:04.335 --> 02:25:08.960]  But I'm going to play this to hopefully court controversy.
[02:25:10.441 --> 02:25:15.323]  Because this is amongst the banned Looney Tunes cartoons.
[02:25:15.403 --> 02:25:20.085]  And I mean, there are some from the 40s and stuff that you could say were super stereotypical and are meant to be racist.
[02:25:21.525 --> 02:25:28.148]  But that's, by the way, those banned cartoons still air in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia.
[02:25:28.868 --> 02:25:31.289]  Because the folks that are being made fun of love it.
[02:25:31.749 --> 02:25:34.430]  Because the truth is, it's not making fun of a cowboy.
[02:25:36.329 --> 02:25:43.716]  If you show Yosemite Sam as three feet tall and going, I hate rabbits and acting goofy and ridiculous.
[02:25:44.016 --> 02:25:45.437]  It's not making fun of white people.
[02:25:46.658 --> 02:25:50.842]  It's making fun of that stereotype of goofy white people that think they're tough.
[02:25:52.043 --> 02:25:52.743]  It's an archetype.
[02:25:54.325 --> 02:25:57.828]  And so I was making the joke about Hassan Chop from Aladdin's Lamp.
[02:25:57.888 --> 02:25:58.588]  So we looked it up.
[02:25:59.349 --> 02:26:03.473]  The public's so ignorant, the YouTube channel that's got it says Bugs Bunny in India.
[02:26:04.511 --> 02:26:06.653]  Aladdin's Lamp is in Saudi Arabia.
[02:26:09.696 --> 02:26:11.317]  I forget the name of the book I read when I was a kid.
[02:26:11.377 --> 02:26:12.098]  It's a classic.
[02:26:12.118 --> 02:26:13.099]  Arabian Nights.
[02:26:13.119 --> 02:26:14.520]  It's a whole bunch of stories.
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:14.980]  It's thick.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.182]  I still have the blue book on my bookshelf.
[02:26:18.023 --> 02:26:19.744]  My son read it years ago again.
[02:26:21.466 --> 02:26:23.408]  But they have, this does not air.
[02:26:24.428 --> 02:26:26.050]  This is on the list of banned ones.
[02:26:29.133 --> 02:26:29.253]  And
[02:26:30.834 --> 02:26:39.820]  That's why we're going to play it for cultural fair use analysis, because it's important to look at it and understand a lot of different things.
[02:26:40.260 --> 02:26:48.025]  It's not attacking country people, having Yosemite Sam, or, you know, showing Little John as being fat and stupid.
[02:26:48.445 --> 02:26:50.846]  They don't want to show images like that now they're trying to restrict them.
[02:26:50.886 --> 02:26:59.292]  This is a war on information, a war on free speech, a war on culture, a war on ideas, a war on real liberalism that these people are the opposite of.
[02:27:00.049 --> 02:27:01.390]  They've stolen the name liberalism.
[02:27:02.050 --> 02:27:06.172]  Here is a clip from Bugs Bunny in India, according to whoever posted it.
[02:27:06.192 --> 02:27:06.572]  Here it is.
[02:27:07.493 --> 02:27:12.855]  India, land of quiet contemplation, peaceful solitude.
[02:27:13.976 --> 02:27:16.537]  See, they cut that into the front.
[02:27:16.897 --> 02:27:18.058]  I guess maybe they're not ignorant.
[02:27:18.378 --> 02:27:23.321]  It's a joke, because that's not from the same... That's what that is.
[02:27:23.741 --> 02:27:25.422]  I just realized, I just went and found the clip.
[02:27:26.082 --> 02:27:27.623]  That's not from the same show.
[02:27:29.349 --> 02:27:31.610]  They put something in, so maybe it's a joke?
[02:27:31.770 --> 02:27:32.251]  I don't get it.
[02:27:32.311 --> 02:27:33.731]  But the rest of it is Warner Brothers.
[02:27:33.952 --> 02:27:34.332]  Here it is.
[02:27:38.074 --> 02:27:44.137]  God will this treasure, oh Hassan, or thee jackals shall grow fat on thy carcass.
[02:27:44.837 --> 02:27:47.339]  No one shall pass Hassan.
[02:27:57.794 --> 02:28:03.316]  Open the... the open... the... Oh, great genie!
[02:28:03.756 --> 02:28:04.717]  Me genie!
[02:28:04.817 --> 02:28:07.678]  The light brown hair!
[02:28:07.798 --> 02:28:09.339]  Oh, mighty genie!
[02:28:24.432 --> 02:28:27.033]  I shall grant thee a rich reward.
[02:28:27.294 --> 02:28:28.174]  He's lying!
[02:28:28.214 --> 02:28:28.794]  Chop him!
[02:28:28.854 --> 02:28:29.375]  Chop him!
[02:28:29.395 --> 02:28:32.216]  Hassan, release you!
[02:28:32.616 --> 02:28:33.437]  Oh, master!
[02:28:33.917 --> 02:28:37.899]  We're Daffy Ducks making fun of a Yankee accent.
[02:28:37.919 --> 02:28:38.719]  They were Yankees.
[02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:39.320]  It's funny.
[02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:40.500]  Thank you, Hassan.
[02:28:40.941 --> 02:28:45.823]  Now, wouldst thou like to have all this treasure for thy very own?
[02:28:46.623 --> 02:28:48.244]  Oh, yes, master.
[02:28:48.264 --> 02:28:49.325]  Hey, what's this?
[02:28:52.193 --> 02:28:54.434]  I might bring another quick four bits on the open market.
[02:28:55.775 --> 02:28:58.897]  I am the genie of the lamp, oh master.
[02:28:59.457 --> 02:29:00.178]  Oh, no you don't!
[02:29:00.218 --> 02:29:01.258]  You want my treasure!
[02:29:01.278 --> 02:29:02.799]  Well, it's mine, understand?
[02:29:02.959 --> 02:29:03.660]  All mine!
[02:29:03.800 --> 02:29:05.301]  Down, down, go, go!
[02:29:05.361 --> 02:29:05.981]  Mine!
[02:29:07.482 --> 02:29:11.524]  Dog, you have desecrated the spirit of the lamp.
[02:29:11.864 --> 02:29:12.225]  Yike!
[02:29:12.625 --> 02:29:15.426]  Prepare to take the consequences!
[02:29:16.067 --> 02:29:16.787]  Consequences?
[02:29:16.807 --> 02:29:17.588]  Small consequences.
[02:29:17.628 --> 02:29:18.588]  As long as I'm rich.
[02:29:22.734 --> 02:29:24.295]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:26.957 --> 02:29:27.717]  Oh my gosh.
[02:29:27.978 --> 02:29:36.904]  I can't tell you how many people I've tried to work with and I've tried to help that think I need them and that I'm weak so they stab me in the back after I try to help build a media operation.
[02:29:38.004 --> 02:29:42.868]  And that's why it's so refreshing with Drudge is that he really wants to help other people to promote liberty and build them up.
[02:29:44.156 --> 02:29:50.821]  And so it's good to actually be in the position where somebody's bigger than I am and is helping me and helping us fight for freedom and to realize he gets it and is classy.
[02:29:51.302 --> 02:29:53.664]  But I think of a lot of people I've helped, they're kind of like Daffy Duck.
[02:29:53.984 --> 02:29:58.468]  Just too stupid to... Too stupid, too evil, too twisted to really want to fight tyranny.
[02:29:58.689 --> 02:30:00.110]  They're in the Liberty Movement just to make money.
[02:30:00.150 --> 02:30:01.031]  We're on the march.
[02:30:01.511 --> 02:30:03.132]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:04.053 --> 02:30:06.736]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:11.010 --> 02:30:15.331]  Matt Drudge challenges Barack Obama to give up his guns.
[02:30:15.771 --> 02:30:21.933]  The news icon calls on the President and Hillary Clinton to relinquish their Secret Service protection.
[02:30:22.173 --> 02:30:23.334]  I challenge Hillary.
[02:30:23.614 --> 02:30:25.134]  Take away your Secret Service.
[02:30:25.414 --> 02:30:26.315]  Take it away now.
[02:30:26.435 --> 02:30:27.715]  Have no security around you.
[02:30:28.035 --> 02:30:29.476]  Have no guns around you, Hillary.
[02:30:29.816 --> 02:30:30.536]  I dare you.
[02:30:30.716 --> 02:30:31.216]  I dare you.
[02:30:31.576 --> 02:30:32.536]  Obama, same thing.
[02:30:32.776 --> 02:30:34.037]  Drop your guns, Obama.
[02:30:34.807 --> 02:30:36.749]  Take your secret service away, Obama.
[02:30:36.909 --> 02:30:38.031]  Take it all away.
[02:30:38.211 --> 02:30:40.093]  Leave the White House unguarded, Obama.
[02:30:40.213 --> 02:30:43.116]  Let everybody know there's no guns on the White House grounds, Obama.
[02:30:43.156 --> 02:30:44.758]  You know what would happen in 30 seconds?
[02:30:45.078 --> 02:30:47.101]  Both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth.
[02:30:47.761 --> 02:30:48.742]  So they're asking us!
[02:30:49.642 --> 02:30:54.646]  To drop our guns and to drop our security measures or, or what?
[02:30:55.146 --> 02:31:01.130]  So this thing is very real and I don't see how it's being taken seriously except for the sick voter.
[02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:05.553]  That was yesterday during a surprise appearance on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:31:05.713 --> 02:31:08.735]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:10.632 --> 02:31:13.834]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:14.154 --> 02:31:22.179]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:22.399 --> 02:31:27.422]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:31:27.642 --> 02:31:30.104]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:31:41.704 --> 02:31:43.785]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:31:43.905 --> 02:31:48.648]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:31:48.888 --> 02:31:52.070]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:31:52.190 --> 02:31:55.373]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:31:55.673 --> 02:31:57.414]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:31:57.654 --> 02:31:58.555]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:31:58.575 --> 02:31:59.495]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:31:59.775 --> 02:32:01.636]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[02:32:10.361 --> 02:32:15.804]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[02:32:16.125 --> 02:32:21.948]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds.
[02:32:22.108 --> 02:32:22.388]  I'm good.
[02:32:44.386 --> 02:32:47.747]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[02:32:47.948 --> 02:32:51.909]  LiverShield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[02:32:52.069 --> 02:32:56.071]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[02:32:56.391 --> 02:33:00.433]  LiverShield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[02:33:15.484 --> 02:33:19.446]  Hotel Motel makes you wanna cry.
[02:33:21.806 --> 02:33:26.388]  Live from the IncoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.889 --> 02:33:29.549]  Gettin' robbed.
[02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:32.491]  Gettin' cooked.
[02:33:32.711 --> 02:33:35.752]  I'm here to tell you it's harder than it looks.
[02:33:42.930 --> 02:33:44.273]  Going to a show.
[02:33:46.839 --> 02:33:47.741]  Coming up, folks.
[02:33:49.966 --> 02:33:51.229]  Hey, rock and roll.
[02:33:53.635 --> 02:33:54.576]  Alright, I gotta go to your calls.
[02:33:54.616 --> 02:33:55.996]  I've been really bad and I apologize.
[02:33:56.016 --> 02:33:58.238]  Then I'll get to these other clips and news that are really serious.
[02:33:58.298 --> 02:34:01.400]  But, uh, Leanne McAdoo will be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:34:01.620 --> 02:34:03.761]  The lovely and intelligent Leanne McAdoo.
[02:34:04.521 --> 02:34:15.007]  And then she's gonna have Professor Noel Sharkey, his story was on DrudgeReport.com yesterday, uh, dealing with the fact that combat robots killing humans is inevitable and is rolling out.
[02:34:15.047 --> 02:34:20.811]  So she'll get into automated drones, weapons systems, and more in the fourth hour.
[02:34:21.131 --> 02:34:22.552]  And also get some more of the Drudge clips
[02:34:23.252 --> 02:34:25.494]  I mean, I haven't even... I spent a lot of the first hour on this.
[02:34:27.115 --> 02:34:30.238]  It isn't really about Drudge even being on the show, even though that was interesting.
[02:34:30.678 --> 02:34:31.358]  Very interesting.
[02:34:32.199 --> 02:34:33.900]  On a Richter scale, it's about a 10 for me.
[02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:38.664]  I can't think of anything else more interesting in my 20-plus years on air.
[02:34:38.984 --> 02:34:45.229]  Maybe the Piers Morgan interview, and that was Drudge again sending him tweets saying, why don't you have him on then if you're attacking?
[02:34:46.330 --> 02:34:48.892]  And they told me, yeah, we got you on because Drudge thought it was a good idea.
[02:34:52.059 --> 02:34:54.181]  That's how those egomaniacs work, I guess, at that level.
[02:34:54.201 --> 02:34:56.722]  Well, Drudge said, and kind of it is a good idea, let's have you up.
[02:34:57.063 --> 02:35:00.645]  And I played stupid on the phone and everything with him and acted dumb.
[02:35:00.665 --> 02:35:01.666]  It was ridiculous.
[02:35:02.086 --> 02:35:05.389]  Just to get on the air with him live, because that's what they do not like that to happen.
[02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:07.831]  But there's just been massive coverage of it.
[02:35:09.377 --> 02:35:13.761]  There's serious articles in places like The Hill and The Daily Caller and Politico.
[02:35:13.842 --> 02:35:14.702]  Somewhat serious.
[02:35:15.623 --> 02:35:17.685]  But here's what The Huffington Post put out and others.
[02:35:18.066 --> 02:35:25.834]  Hilariously paranoid Matt Drudge appears on conspiracy monger Alex Jones Show to slag salon demand a location of Hillary's lovers.
[02:35:25.874 --> 02:35:28.316]  That was actually a salon.
[02:35:28.376 --> 02:35:32.381]  Matt Drudge scolds Hillary, the media and the sickness of American people.
[02:35:34.191 --> 02:35:36.412]  That's another report, CNN.
[02:35:37.333 --> 02:35:40.755]  Here's another one, Drudge, Hillary Clinton's brain in a jar could get elected, Politico.
[02:35:43.237 --> 02:35:48.320]  Matt Drudge gives incredibly rare interview to Alex Jones, talks Hillary and sick America.
[02:35:48.420 --> 02:35:55.344]  So, very glad that Drudge came on and gave us, the last interview he gave was like five minutes long and it was national news.
[02:35:55.624 --> 02:35:57.245]  This one's forty-something minutes long.
[02:35:57.645 --> 02:36:00.027]  It's on InfoWars.com if you missed it yesterday.
[02:36:02.677 --> 02:36:07.578]  That is definitely something that is going to be a rebroadcaster multiple times.
[02:36:07.938 --> 02:36:08.959]  One of the best interviews ever.
[02:36:11.059 --> 02:36:16.501]  I interrupt a lot of guests because if I think they're boring or they're droning on or I want to add something that ties together.
[02:36:16.861 --> 02:36:17.901]  It's obnoxious sometimes.
[02:36:18.802 --> 02:36:20.022]  I agree I do it a little too much.
[02:36:20.062 --> 02:36:21.302]  I've gotten a bit better over the years.
[02:36:21.742 --> 02:36:24.903]  When I want to talk, I'll just hog the show and not have guests take calls.
[02:36:26.184 --> 02:36:29.885]  But I'll tell you what, Drudge, I shut up about 90% of the time because it was really interesting.
[02:36:29.905 --> 02:36:30.925]  I think I could talk for five hours.
[02:36:32.129 --> 02:36:32.930]  I don't know.
[02:36:52.660 --> 02:36:53.241]  Really interesting.
[02:36:53.261 --> 02:36:54.662]  And I've talked to folks a lot that know him well.
[02:36:54.942 --> 02:36:55.782]  Watson knows him.
[02:36:55.822 --> 02:36:57.304]  Been out to dinner with him and stuff.
[02:36:57.804 --> 02:37:02.147]  And I've always just gotten messages through from him or people relaying things.
[02:37:02.187 --> 02:37:03.328]  He's that elusive.
[02:37:04.849 --> 02:37:05.530]  I'll leave it at that.
[02:37:06.570 --> 02:37:07.791]  Other ways we've communicated.
[02:37:08.332 --> 02:37:10.854]  But, it's interesting.
[02:37:10.874 --> 02:37:14.116]  Because it's not just somebody being reclusive to create the mystique.
[02:37:15.637 --> 02:37:18.939]  He did that after a bunch of persecution, which I'm not going to get into.
[02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:20.401]  But,
[02:37:21.297 --> 02:37:25.522]  The persecution of everybody is intensifying and they want to put everybody in jail, folks.
[02:37:27.565 --> 02:37:29.487]  And I've talked to a lot of other high-powered people.
[02:37:29.567 --> 02:37:34.173]  I've talked to... It's not even really known.
[02:37:34.233 --> 02:37:35.615]  He doesn't make a big deal out of it.
[02:37:37.356 --> 02:37:40.197]  I wasn't told this by Drudge, I already knew this because I've talked to him quite frequently.
[02:37:40.497 --> 02:37:42.097]  It's no secret, off air.
[02:37:42.117 --> 02:37:45.118]  I won't really reveal what he told me, but Michael Savage, I need to call him.
[02:37:45.358 --> 02:37:46.118]  We haven't talked in a while.
[02:37:46.958 --> 02:37:48.439]  We talk a bunch, but we don't talk for a few months.
[02:37:49.499 --> 02:37:54.340]  And, you know, he says on air they're coming for us, they're going to kill everybody, but, you know, if they keep getting power.
[02:37:54.540 --> 02:37:55.680]  But, I mean, the behind-the-scenes stuff.
[02:37:55.700 --> 02:37:57.581]  And, you know, Michael Savage doesn't need to be on air.
[02:37:58.061 --> 02:38:00.602]  He sold like 20-something New York Times bestsellers.
[02:38:00.622 --> 02:38:01.402]  It was just sick.
[02:38:02.199 --> 02:38:08.180]  He had a whole other persona as like the guy that kind of brought herbs and minerals and vitamins in in the 60s and 70s.
[02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:10.861]  And then he created a bunch of other huge phenomenons.
[02:38:11.041 --> 02:38:12.461]  Well, his wife and son did.
[02:38:12.481 --> 02:38:19.103]  I mean, I'm not going to get into the stuff that people own and created, and they made their money themselves.
[02:38:20.163 --> 02:38:21.663]  Michael Savage is worth billions.
[02:38:22.163 --> 02:38:23.243]  I shouldn't be getting into it.
[02:38:23.283 --> 02:38:25.804]  The point is, it's not a secret.
[02:38:27.233 --> 02:38:28.714]  I didn't get that even from him.
[02:38:29.194 --> 02:38:32.536]  It's just that he doesn't need the money at 73 years old.
[02:38:34.357 --> 02:38:37.978]  He genuinely is concerned about what's happening and what's going on and wants to do more.
[02:38:38.139 --> 02:38:42.701]  And my problem is I'm so busy I haven't even been able to figure out how to... I'm not going to get into it.
[02:38:44.659 --> 02:38:47.643]  It's just, it's very retrospective, the stuff that's going on.
[02:38:48.464 --> 02:38:49.325]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:38:49.345 --> 02:38:50.146]  You're a real trooper.
[02:38:50.466 --> 02:38:56.653]  Evan in New York, because you did this, give me your name, your address, I'm going to send you the size, a free Hillary for Prison shirt.
[02:38:57.034 --> 02:39:01.319]  From now on, when someone holds over an hour, this is to incentivize me not doing it because I'll go broke.
[02:39:01.359 --> 02:39:02.620]  I don't have that much extra money.
[02:39:02.660 --> 02:39:04.382]  I spend all of it on this operation, or most of it.
[02:39:05.003 --> 02:39:09.025]  Got an emergency war chest, so we're not easy to push over, but still, it ain't that deep.
[02:39:09.045 --> 02:39:09.645]  Needs to be deeper.
[02:39:09.985 --> 02:39:11.326]  Get your Hillary shirts.
[02:39:11.366 --> 02:39:12.206]  Hillary for President.
[02:39:12.466 --> 02:39:16.668]  We're only selling them until December 18th, the last day we can ship for Christmas.
[02:39:17.128 --> 02:39:21.230]  We have free shipping running right now on all the ProPure G2 water filters.
[02:39:21.290 --> 02:39:23.931]  If you want to stop drinking glyphosates and fluoride, you might want to check into it.
[02:39:23.951 --> 02:39:25.672]  10% off and free shipping.
[02:39:25.692 --> 02:39:26.312]  That's giant.
[02:39:26.812 --> 02:39:32.634]  We have 20% off the incredible prostate formula there at InfoWars.com.
[02:39:32.674 --> 02:39:36.355]  Prostagard, and we are selling out of Survival Shield, Nacinide, INX2.
[02:39:36.655 --> 02:39:39.036]  Your purchases make the entire transmission possible.
[02:39:39.516 --> 02:39:41.617]  And we have a new special on InfoWars Select.

[02:40:08.169 --> 02:40:14.010]  Now, in the words of Hassan Chop, let's chop off my talking and go directly to Evan in New York.
[02:40:14.090 --> 02:40:14.450]  Go ahead.
[02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:16.710]  Hey, Alex.
[02:40:16.890 --> 02:40:19.751]  I just want to say I really appreciate the free gift.
[02:40:19.771 --> 02:40:21.691]  I actually have a gift I would like to give back to you.
[02:40:23.072 --> 02:40:27.472]  I decided to reach out and fight against the New World Order myself.
[02:40:27.972 --> 02:40:29.973]  And I see how there's no age cap anymore.
[02:40:30.573 --> 02:40:37.534]  You know, they've gone as old as to the extent of life that we can live up to, to even while we're in the womb.
[02:40:38.820 --> 02:40:41.101]  And I just see the culture where it's revolving around.
[02:40:41.521 --> 02:40:44.543]  This year I battled cancer, so I had a lot of time to reflect.
[02:40:44.703 --> 02:40:44.943]  Wow.
[02:40:45.223 --> 02:40:45.924]  Also in prayer.
[02:40:46.904 --> 02:40:48.945]  And I decided to go back to writing.
[02:40:49.765 --> 02:40:51.026]  And I'm writing a book series.
[02:40:51.506 --> 02:40:54.388]  A children's book series that will evolve through teenager years.
[02:40:55.788 --> 02:40:59.731]  Kind of a spiritual book, but to relate to what's going on.
[02:40:59.812 --> 02:41:04.075]  So I could battle the New World Order and relate to what's going on in a book.
[02:41:04.616 --> 02:41:08.679]  So I could get it out to the children before they get to our children.
[02:41:09.140 --> 02:41:11.401]  And then it could get to the teenagers and get to us.
[02:41:11.942 --> 02:41:12.522]  Absolutely.
[02:41:12.542 --> 02:41:22.371]  Art and culture that's based on liberty and individualism is the wooden stake through Count Dracula's heart.
[02:41:23.869 --> 02:41:24.529]  Exactly, Alex.
[02:41:24.590 --> 02:41:30.033]  And, you know, I'd actually like to give you, personally, my writings to you.
[02:41:30.113 --> 02:41:32.094]  I'd love for you to read it and share it with your son.
[02:41:32.134 --> 02:41:33.455]  I think the two of you would love it.
[02:41:34.315 --> 02:41:36.517]  Well, I'd love to see it, but I don't want to get it until you've published it.
[02:41:38.262 --> 02:41:42.145]  No Alex, feel free, I would love for you to hear it, hear me out about it.
[02:41:42.765 --> 02:41:45.347]  I'd just like to see, what do you think, what are your thoughts?
[02:41:45.647 --> 02:41:49.250]  Well, I would love to commit to tell you that I would end up reading it.
[02:41:49.350 --> 02:41:52.232]  I'm not sure I would have time, but I would definitely give it to my son to read.
[02:41:52.732 --> 02:41:55.574]  I'll be honest with you, I've got so much to read it makes my head spin, but I want to.
[02:41:56.535 --> 02:42:03.499]  My eyes just get tired from the amount of reading I already do, but it used to be a pleasure, now it's not a pleasure some of the time.
[02:42:03.519 --> 02:42:05.641]  But yes, I'd love to hear about your book.
[02:42:06.001 --> 02:42:07.202]  What are you planning to call the series?
[02:42:08.585 --> 02:42:09.986]  It's called The Divine Warrior.
[02:42:10.906 --> 02:42:17.489]  It's basically about a chosen orphan boy who is chosen by God to find these six pieces of armor hidden around the world.
[02:42:18.510 --> 02:42:19.610]  Oh, that's awesome!
[02:42:19.630 --> 02:42:21.991]  That's a great way for kids to get into the armor of God.
[02:42:22.011 --> 02:42:34.657]  Yeah, so actually it's a physical armor now, so it relates to everything from the Cup of Christ to the Freemasonry, so the culture that revolves around the modern times, because it takes place now in our time.
[02:42:35.134 --> 02:42:37.536]  Well, that sounds exciting and it sounds like a hit, brother.
[02:42:37.576 --> 02:42:39.217]  What do you want to say about the breakup of the family?
[02:42:41.119 --> 02:42:44.582]  Well, I think, you know, we need to just go back to the things you talk about.
[02:42:45.182 --> 02:42:46.503]  It's going back to our Lord.
[02:42:46.984 --> 02:42:50.066]  It's revolving around that and revolving around forgiveness.
[02:42:51.007 --> 02:42:55.611]  You know, it's one of the strongest things to do is not go for revenge, but forgive.
[02:42:56.952 --> 02:42:58.634]  I've learned to do that.
[02:42:58.654 --> 02:43:01.176]  I mean, I never really did a lot of revenge stuff, but I would
[02:43:02.722 --> 02:43:09.947]  Enjoy people lying about me wanting to destroy me and they're not being able to and I repented of that Five six years ago.
[02:43:09.967 --> 02:43:20.074]  I pretty much quit it in the last three years and I've been a lot happier It's been a lot better And now I just feel sorry for him and then if somebody's productive other than attacking me
[02:43:20.914 --> 02:43:27.561]  I'll actually reach out to him and support him, and I'll say, go ahead and keep attacking, it's okay, I understand, but I'm gonna help you with this other good work you're doing.
[02:43:28.021 --> 02:43:32.526]  And it always ends up turning him around, so it's really a good thing, and I hear you.
[02:43:32.566 --> 02:43:38.192]  God bless you, great to hear from you, and put you on hold, because we're gonna send you, we hang up on him.
[02:43:38.532 --> 02:43:43.818]  Call back in after the show if you don't get back in, or send us a letter, and I'll send you two shirts.
[02:43:46.272 --> 02:43:48.154]  Hello Alex Jones, I want to thank you for taking my call.
[02:44:07.737 --> 02:44:08.698]  Okay, thank you, my friend.
[02:44:09.118 --> 02:44:12.360]  God bless you, and I love you, and I pray for you.
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:15.882]  But I have a couple of serious bones to pick with you.
[02:44:15.982 --> 02:44:16.863]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:44:17.703 --> 02:44:20.645]  I am not a nitpicker, but this is very, very serious.
[02:44:20.765 --> 02:44:21.806]  Well, I like your voice.
[02:44:21.846 --> 02:44:22.366]  Please continue.
[02:44:23.206 --> 02:44:23.507]  Okay.
[02:44:23.847 --> 02:44:29.010]  The other day, you was talking about that guy who was killing people.
[02:44:29.090 --> 02:44:30.531]  He asked them, were they Christians?
[02:44:31.081 --> 02:44:32.923]  Then he shot them.
[02:44:33.464 --> 02:44:39.711]  And I heard you say with my own ears that if someone asked you, were you a Christian, you would say no.
[02:44:40.272 --> 02:44:42.514]  Well, this is very important.
[02:44:42.594 --> 02:44:50.664]  The Bible says in Matthew chapter 10, verse 30, whoever denied Jesus Christ before men,
[02:44:51.405 --> 02:44:54.347]  Jesus said, I will deny them before my father.
[02:44:54.427 --> 02:44:55.608]  I know that quote, and you're right.
[02:44:55.648 --> 02:45:02.833]  I thought about that after I was being honest, and I was asking the audience what they thought, and I was asking Joe Biggs.
[02:45:02.873 --> 02:45:10.239]  I mean, there's also parts of the Bible where the spies are going into a city, and they're told, you know, lie about being a spy.
[02:45:10.639 --> 02:45:19.245]  I mean, I lied when I went inside Bohemian Grove, and if somebody was sticking a head to, say, my children's heads, you know, a gun, and was saying, I'm gonna blow their heads off, I mean, I'm not gonna lie.
[02:45:19.465 --> 02:45:19.905]  I think
[02:45:20.771 --> 02:45:22.052]  Number one, I'd have charged the guy.
[02:45:23.514 --> 02:45:27.057]  So, and I'm not saying I'm tough, I guarantee you, I mean, I'd try to get away or I'd charge him.
[02:45:27.097 --> 02:45:28.038]  I mean, that's just how I am.
[02:45:28.398 --> 02:45:29.579]  I wonder why people don't do that.
[02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:31.121]  That shows the domestication.
[02:45:31.141 --> 02:45:43.212]  So I was honest, and I think it's open for debate, and I absolutely hear what you're saying, and I understand it's about not denying Christ to four men and getting burned at the stake or being killed by the lions, and I get that
[02:45:44.352 --> 02:45:44.532]  That's
[02:45:58.510 --> 02:46:02.833]  I'll sit there and, you know, say I had a girlfriend and she said, you like this dress?
[02:46:02.893 --> 02:46:03.933]  I've learned they don't want to know the truth.
[02:46:04.173 --> 02:46:05.054]  I'll say, yeah, that's fine, honey.
[02:46:05.094 --> 02:46:06.175]  I kind of like that one better, though.
[02:46:06.435 --> 02:46:07.095]  That's a lie.
[02:46:07.115 --> 02:46:10.717]  So I wasn't being a liar on the big issues, and lying's not good.
[02:46:10.757 --> 02:46:13.539]  I'm so truthful, it really freaks people out.
[02:46:14.260 --> 02:46:16.761]  And I've had a lot of problems telling the truth, also a lot of good stuff.
[02:46:17.201 --> 02:46:23.405]  So then I was being so truthful, I was saying, I wonder if God would judge you if to not be killed.
[02:46:23.425 --> 02:46:26.107]  I mean, a bunch of Christians did deny Christ and got killed.
[02:46:26.567 --> 02:46:27.988]  And I think they have incredible courage, but
[02:46:29.474 --> 02:46:32.997]  I just still kind of wish they'd have the courage to attack this piece of trash.
[02:46:33.157 --> 02:46:33.637]  What do you think?
[02:46:34.898 --> 02:46:39.162]  Well, Alex, attacking is one thing, but let me finish.
[02:46:39.182 --> 02:46:40.343]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[02:46:40.423 --> 02:46:40.763]  I'm sorry.
[02:46:41.664 --> 02:46:42.925]  Okay.
[02:46:43.866 --> 02:46:48.750]  The Bible says, if you are not a Christian, then you can deny Jesus Christ.
[02:46:49.110 --> 02:46:51.412]  Peter denied Jesus Christ three times.
[02:46:51.852 --> 02:46:57.797]  But remember, Jesus Christ said, Peter, when thou art converted, strengthen thy brother.
[02:46:59.378 --> 02:46:59.959]  I don't know.
[02:47:17.781 --> 02:47:20.003]  And then later he did not deny Christ and they all got killed.
[02:47:20.043 --> 02:47:21.665]  No, you have corrected me.
[02:47:21.785 --> 02:47:23.066]  I get up here without a teleprompter.
[02:47:23.406 --> 02:47:32.956]  I just speak from my heart and you're absolutely right that I think somebody is in mortal danger of being denied by Christ at the White Throne Judgment.
[02:47:33.016 --> 02:47:35.658]  If you don't, I guess you're meant to be killed.
[02:47:35.718 --> 02:47:36.259]  I guess you're right.
[02:47:37.574 --> 02:47:40.836]  You know, I thank God for your honesty.
[02:47:41.216 --> 02:47:47.440]  And so, because when people hear you, millions of people might say, well, I can do the same thing.
[02:47:47.961 --> 02:47:48.421]  No, I know.
[02:47:48.481 --> 02:47:49.562]  I just speak from my heart.
[02:47:49.662 --> 02:47:51.203]  I just constantly say what I really think.
[02:47:51.403 --> 02:47:55.225]  And, you know, I admit, I mean, I admit that that's what I was thinking.
[02:47:55.265 --> 02:47:59.388]  I mean, number one, it wouldn't get to that point because I'd be attacking him.
[02:48:01.519 --> 02:48:08.790]  But now you know, because we want people to realize, if you are a Christian, please do not deny Jesus Christ.
[02:48:09.151 --> 02:48:14.439]  You got people, they may think, well, I didn't take the mark of the beast in.
[02:48:14.459 --> 02:48:15.341]  You're absolutely right.
[02:48:15.521 --> 02:48:16.242]  Now that you say it.
[02:48:17.003 --> 02:48:26.212]  I got caught up thinking about just wishing they hadn't been killed and I was deceived and now that you you called up and reproved me and straightened me up and that's what I need.
[02:48:26.432 --> 02:48:27.653]  That's what we need to get other people straight.
[02:48:27.693 --> 02:48:28.354]  We all get off.
[02:48:28.774 --> 02:48:31.937]  We all need people to give us loving advice and you did that my friend.
[02:48:32.277 --> 02:48:33.639]  Nathaniel, thank you so much.
[02:48:34.099 --> 02:48:35.821]  Was there anything else you wanted to explain to me?
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:37.160]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:37.781]  That's the one thing.
[02:48:37.801 --> 02:48:41.144]  Well, first of all, thank God for your heart that you received that.
[02:48:41.204 --> 02:48:41.725]  God bless you.
[02:48:41.745 --> 02:48:43.146]  You are a precious brother.
[02:48:43.407 --> 02:48:45.429]  Now, one more thing is very, very important.
[02:48:45.449 --> 02:48:49.032]  I hear you talk about taking back the country and everything.
[02:48:49.513 --> 02:49:00.764]  Well, Alex, when the Infowars and Prison Planet and Matt George and all you all, I can see y'all slowing down the new world order.
[02:49:01.161 --> 02:49:09.182]  Before stopping it, when the Antichrist comes on the scene, and the beast, and the false prophet, we're not going to be able to stop them.
[02:49:09.442 --> 02:49:13.283]  The Bible says the Antichrist... He makes war upon the saints and overcomes them, yes.
[02:49:13.883 --> 02:49:15.284]  And he's going to wear the saints out.
[02:49:15.464 --> 02:49:23.305]  Only Jesus Christ is going to come and destroy the Antichrist and cast the beast and false prophet into the lake of fire.
[02:49:23.565 --> 02:49:28.766]  Now again, I can see you slowing down before... No, no, no, I agree with you, but then they...
[02:49:29.226 --> 02:49:41.175]  Christians and other people that hate tyranny, whoever you are, should be speaking out and warning people, because what matters is your intellect, your soul, your consciousness, and that's what The Globalist is trying to take.
[02:49:41.215 --> 02:49:43.857]  In fact, we'll come into the next segment with We Want Your Soul.
[02:49:44.457 --> 02:49:46.418]  Because that's what they want.
[02:49:46.978 --> 02:49:50.700]  And so, people say, well, God's just going to get me out of this, so I don't have to stand up.
[02:49:50.760 --> 02:49:59.845]  Well, people had to go in the lion's den, they had to go in the fiery furnace, and sometimes you got to go up there and, you know, get hung up on a cross, or get your head chopped off, or get boiled in oil, and all the things they did.
[02:49:59.905 --> 02:50:00.465]  I get that.
[02:50:00.985 --> 02:50:05.868]  And so, you're absolutely right, and I just get up here sometimes in a fever of news and information.
[02:50:06.728 --> 02:50:13.632]  That's why I've said many times, I hear rebroadcast all the time, and here's stuff I say that's wrong, or that I don't agree with, or where I misspoke.
[02:50:14.568 --> 02:50:16.010]  There's a reason they have teleprompters.
[02:50:16.030 --> 02:50:20.574]  There's a reason they script stuff because other people would stick their foot in their mouth more than me.
[02:50:20.594 --> 02:50:21.395]  But you're absolutely right.
[02:50:21.435 --> 02:50:21.936]  God bless you.
[02:50:21.956 --> 02:50:23.578]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:50:23.638 --> 02:50:24.138]  Great call.
[02:50:24.439 --> 02:50:26.741]  I love calls like that because... Don't hang up on him.
[02:50:26.761 --> 02:50:27.061]  That's right.
[02:50:28.004 --> 02:50:41.050]  Get his info and size and send him a Hillary for Prison shirt or something else that he wants off the site that's of a lesser or greater, I don't care if it's like 30 bucks or whatever, just a t-shirt.
[02:50:41.230 --> 02:50:42.390]  How about a t-shirt of his choice?
[02:50:42.851 --> 02:50:43.611]  There, we'll do it that way.
[02:50:43.631 --> 02:50:44.931]  A t-shirt of his choice.
[02:50:44.972 --> 02:50:46.772]  That'll turn into a big hoopla.
[02:50:48.473 --> 02:50:50.294]  Now, nobody else has been holding an hour yet.
[02:50:50.354 --> 02:50:52.155]  If I get to Brandon, it's 51 minutes.
[02:50:52.555 --> 02:50:53.676]  Lucas is 45.
[02:50:54.136 --> 02:50:54.496]  Phil is 50.
[02:50:54.657 --> 02:50:57.418]  And then other folks haven't been holding that long.
[02:50:57.458 --> 02:50:58.979]  So we'll get your calls.
[02:50:59.019 --> 02:51:02.141]  And I got a bunch of other news, too, that we haven't quite hit yet.
[02:51:02.221 --> 02:51:04.122]  So stay with us in fullwars.com.
[02:51:04.642 --> 02:51:07.824]  And we need to get this article out about Obama being disarmed.
[02:51:07.864 --> 02:51:09.085]  Help make this go viral, folks.
[02:51:11.038 --> 02:51:21.621]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[02:51:21.921 --> 02:51:25.843]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[02:51:26.103 --> 02:51:27.923]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:28.243 --> 02:51:33.705]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:33.885 --> 02:51:43.647]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:51:43.907 --> 02:51:50.149]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:51:50.389 --> 02:51:53.710]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[02:51:53.730 --> 02:51:55.570]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:51:55.810 --> 02:51:58.911]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:51:58.971 --> 02:52:02.433]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[02:52:02.453 --> 02:52:05.194]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[02:52:05.294 --> 02:52:09.816]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[02:52:26.303 --> 02:52:31.345]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[02:52:31.545 --> 02:52:40.029]  If you want to boost your Omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.
[02:52:40.249 --> 02:52:43.230]  Nutrigold fish oils are independently 5-star certified.
[02:52:43.490 --> 02:52:43.690]  I think so.
[02:53:10.646 --> 02:53:14.029]  The new frontier in human nutrition and health is that of epigenetics.
[02:53:14.209 --> 02:53:19.693]  Epigenetics refers to the portion of the DNA that you can influence with molecules or frequency signals.
[02:53:20.054 --> 02:53:26.839]  A huge key to detoxification, cellular health, and even eternal youth has to do with what kind of signals you are feeding your cells.
[02:53:27.079 --> 02:53:36.663]  Technology now exists to energetically encode foods or supplements so that the original food you started with is now a carrier of information that communicates health-giving signals to the cells of your body.
[02:53:36.903 --> 02:53:40.145]  The first food of its kind to ever receive this encoding is One World Way.
[02:53:40.505 --> 02:53:44.627]  One World Way has received high praise and generated some amazing testimonies since 2011.
[02:53:44.707 --> 02:53:53.731]  We now know that all the amazing testimonies we've received come primarily from the energy encoding process and secondarily to the high quality ingredients.
[02:53:54.011 --> 02:54:00.135]  To support your metabolism, detoxification, energy, and strength, unlike any supplement you've ever taken, call 888-988-3325.
[02:54:00.155 --> 02:54:00.416]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:54:00.436 --> 02:54:01.156]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:54:01.196 --> 02:54:01.817]  That's OneWorldWhey.com.
[02:54:20.561 --> 02:54:24.694]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:54:25.416 --> 02:54:26.821]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:33.340]  They want the consciousness.
[02:54:33.360 --> 02:54:34.701]  They want the innocence.
[02:54:34.741 --> 02:54:36.121]  They want our children.
[02:54:36.681 --> 02:54:38.082]  They're ghouls.
[02:54:38.882 --> 02:54:40.742]  Dungeon keepers.
[02:54:40.822 --> 02:54:42.403]  Globalists.
[02:54:42.443 --> 02:54:43.623]  Vampires.
[02:54:44.123 --> 02:54:45.623]  Servants of evil.
[02:54:47.384 --> 02:55:00.007]  And no amount of verbal, semantic, acrobatic ballet can describe the true depths of those
[02:55:01.630 --> 02:55:13.817]  That have taken control of this planet and now want to take control of the individual, the entire life cycle, so that they can rise as the new demigods of planet terra firma.
[02:55:15.158 --> 02:55:15.738]  Crank this up.
[02:55:43.012 --> 02:55:46.673]  I'm going to be honest again with the audience.
[02:55:50.214 --> 02:55:51.494]  I drop the ball routinely.
[02:55:51.834 --> 02:55:53.895]  In many ways, I am losing to the globalists.
[02:55:54.575 --> 02:56:01.717]  In many ways, I'm a guinea pig and an example of how you can be enslaved even while knowing it, even while hating it.
[02:56:03.737 --> 02:56:10.639]  Now, my greatest failure is my greatest success, and I only tell you this so that you can learn from it, hopefully.
[02:56:11.180 --> 02:56:15.341]  From my experiences, you can help teach me as well, just like I just learned from that last caller, deeply.
[02:56:19.483 --> 02:56:21.023]  I'm able to get people out of their trance.
[02:56:21.083 --> 02:56:28.546]  I'm able to get upset, because I'm upset, telegraph that in a genuine way that reaches people.
[02:56:32.216 --> 02:56:38.318]  But I also get so close to the tyranny that when they announce open world government to take over every major U.S.
[02:56:38.338 --> 02:56:39.618]  city with U.N.
[02:56:39.658 --> 02:56:47.360]  advisors for political correctness police and to go after our guns, I haven't made a big enough deal about it.
[02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:57.363]  I saw yesterday when Hillary said, I will sign an executive order and we will take the guns.
[02:56:57.443 --> 02:56:58.203]  I mean, that was a quote.
[02:56:59.634 --> 02:57:00.955]  CNN said the same thing.
[02:57:01.115 --> 02:57:01.715]  MSNBC.
[02:57:01.815 --> 02:57:02.876]  I've seen all these clips.
[02:57:03.336 --> 02:57:09.780]  I should have walked into one of the great guys that can edit real fast and do a good job putting stuff together, like Darren McBreen, and said, Darren, here are these clips.
[02:57:11.161 --> 02:57:16.845]  Let's show Biden saying no one wants to take any of your guns, and then cut to a bunch of people saying it, including the new clips.
[02:57:21.164 --> 02:57:22.865]  And then let's cut to Hillary saying it.
[02:57:23.485 --> 02:57:26.527]  And then let's cut back to Obama two days ago saying no one wants your guns.
[02:57:27.007 --> 02:57:28.748]  It's a crackpot conspiracy theory.
[02:57:29.329 --> 02:57:31.009]  Because that's what counters these people.
[02:57:31.350 --> 02:57:34.511]  Gruber going, we lie to these dumb idiots and triple their prices.
[02:57:36.633 --> 02:57:40.755]  The academics are all rubbing their hands together, oh yes, evil.
[02:57:41.455 --> 02:57:43.316]  Then you go, I never said that.
[02:57:43.376 --> 02:57:44.657]  I never worked with Obama.
[02:57:44.877 --> 02:57:45.597]  I worked with Obama.
[02:57:45.738 --> 02:57:46.758]  I worked with Obama.
[02:57:46.798 --> 02:57:48.139]  Show all the clips of them lying.
[02:57:49.656 --> 02:57:53.519]  So we can't ever get outrage fatigue.
[02:57:53.599 --> 02:57:57.923]  We have to get upset with these scum and throw our full energy against them.
[02:57:59.864 --> 02:58:02.327]  And I'm exhausted fighting them sometimes, but you know, it's got to be done.
[02:58:05.189 --> 02:58:08.672]  Hillary Clinton's gun control proposals include executive action.
[02:58:09.372 --> 02:58:14.056]  Democratic presidential candidate would expand definition of who is in business of selling firearms.
[02:58:15.393 --> 02:58:19.535]  I would ban with executive action the private sale of firearms or trading.
[02:58:21.997 --> 02:58:23.838]  That means giving your son or daughter a firearm.
[02:58:24.558 --> 02:58:29.081]  But her actual quote was that she didn't take executive action to take the guns.
[02:58:32.363 --> 02:58:33.043]  So they're coming.
[02:58:34.175 --> 02:58:34.735]  We're going to go to break.
[02:58:34.755 --> 02:58:36.436]  I'm going to do five more minutes of jamming some of these calls.
[02:58:36.496 --> 02:58:51.700]  And then, Leanne McAdoo from the radio studio slash TV, just 70 feet behind me or so, will be broadcasting and getting into the rise of the robots, the inevitable Terminator revolution with top scientist Noel Sharkey.
[02:58:52.100 --> 02:58:52.800]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.020 --> 02:58:55.721]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:59:00.828 --> 02:59:05.769]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:59:05.889 --> 02:59:11.771]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:59:12.011 --> 02:59:16.612]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:59:16.792 --> 02:59:20.133]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:59:20.353 --> 02:59:21.934]  No needles, no injections.
[02:59:22.334 --> 02:59:26.955]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:30.516 --> 02:59:31.436]  BrainForce is here.
[02:59:31.637 --> 02:59:33.737]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:59:33.837 --> 02:59:38.579]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:59:38.839 --> 02:59:40.480]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[02:59:40.520 --> 02:59:41.981]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:59:42.121 --> 02:59:45.342]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:59:45.602 --> 02:59:47.423]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:59:47.583 --> 02:59:48.483]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:59:48.503 --> 02:59:49.484]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:59:49.724 --> 02:59:51.625]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:59:51.705 --> 02:59:57.207]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:00:03.223 --> 03:00:07.728]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.413 --> 03:00:19.439]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:20.060 --> 03:00:23.042]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.198 --> 03:00:32.182]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are transmitting globally right now, and I've gone a little over today.
[03:00:32.202 --> 03:00:40.247]  I've not completed a lot of stuff I wanted to cover and call, so I'm going to post a little bit into the next segment with Leigh-Anne McAdoo, so we'll be bantering back and forth from two different studios.
[03:00:40.267 --> 03:00:46.070]  In about five minutes into the next segment, I'll leave, but I do want to play a few other clips we haven't gotten to on political correctness today.
[03:00:46.531 --> 03:00:50.453]  Lucas in Texas, you're on the air, thank you for holding, and then we'll go to Brandon.
[03:00:52.074 --> 03:00:53.415]  Hello, Alex, can you hear me?
[03:00:53.635 --> 03:00:54.876]  I can hear you loud and clear.
[03:00:55.942 --> 03:00:57.563]  Okay, thanks for taking my call.
[03:00:57.723 --> 03:00:59.904]  I wanted to comment on the situation in Europe.
[03:01:00.185 --> 03:01:11.712]  I can't believe that the German government has come out and said that they're going to take the children away from people that even make comments about, ooh, we kind of don't like the, you know, immigrant invasion.
[03:01:11.752 --> 03:01:17.075]  That's right, they said do not criticize any of it or we will take your children and fine you and imprison you.
[03:01:17.395 --> 03:01:18.816]  That is beyond Nazi Germany.
[03:01:19.737 --> 03:01:23.079]  I hear that, man, and I just feel sick to my stomach and sick to my head.
[03:01:23.740 --> 03:01:25.101]  But I mean, you're liberal, though.
[03:01:25.161 --> 03:01:26.323]  I mean, Merkel's liberal.
[03:01:26.383 --> 03:01:27.043]  It's okay.
[03:01:27.464 --> 03:01:28.645]  Why are you against a woman, bro?
[03:01:31.868 --> 03:01:42.979]  Well, no, I saw that great report by Paul Joseph Watson on the fact that four out of five refugees are, in fact, not even Syrian, and that most of them are economic migrants.
[03:01:43.019 --> 03:01:46.762]  And I think it's really sick, because I'm looking at an article right now on fucking news
[03:01:48.220 --> 03:01:54.024]  Yeah, it says almost 50 million EU residents live without enough money even to heat their homes.
[03:01:54.604 --> 03:01:59.047]  And these people are supposed to come in and your government is going to come in and tax people.
[03:01:59.067 --> 03:02:03.010]  Yeah, because you're not as valuable as the illegal aliens you're supposed to pay for.
[03:02:03.890 --> 03:02:04.791]  This is robbery.
[03:02:04.851 --> 03:02:06.132]  This is political correctness.
[03:02:06.152 --> 03:02:10.355]  This is Soviet redistribution with big megabanks administering the money.
[03:02:10.395 --> 03:02:13.056]  This is total social engineering on a mass scale.
[03:02:13.897 --> 03:02:15.238]  And I think, I think if
[03:02:15.902 --> 03:02:20.585]  People don't try, just in any peaceful way possible, to change things.
[03:02:21.065 --> 03:02:24.507]  Europe is going to be heading to a complete children of men situation.
[03:02:24.547 --> 03:02:25.868]  No, no, that's it, but let's expand.
[03:02:26.168 --> 03:02:39.897]  You understand they're passing bills at the federal and state level, it's already happening, where the illegals in this country, whether they're white, Chinese, or Hispanic, it doesn't matter, they're getting free everything, free tuition, Obamacare, that the public doesn't get free, but for them it is.
[03:02:40.597 --> 03:02:41.158]  So, I mean,
[03:02:41.898 --> 03:02:43.479]  It is the takedown, brother.
[03:02:43.519 --> 03:02:47.142]  They want to... Look, do banks want you to pay off your farm loan?
[03:02:47.602 --> 03:02:47.782]  No.
[03:02:48.182 --> 03:02:50.624]  They want to call it all in a year early and make you go bankrupt.
[03:02:51.024 --> 03:02:54.166]  I mean, that's how banks, you know, get rich, is they get all that property.
[03:02:54.927 --> 03:02:58.769]  There's so many little banks out in East Texas where they don't even have customers, but they own half the town.
[03:02:59.290 --> 03:03:03.633]  And some one, you know, one old guy's worth, you know, $150 million, and nobody even knows it.
[03:03:04.716 --> 03:03:06.157]  I mean, that's how this works, man.
[03:03:06.657 --> 03:03:08.519]  And this is the controllers doing it.
[03:03:08.959 --> 03:03:09.780]  And they love it, Lucas.
[03:03:09.820 --> 03:03:10.660]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:11.020 --> 03:03:12.541]  Brandon in FEMA Region 3.
[03:03:12.842 --> 03:03:15.183]  What former state are you under, under FEMA, sir?
[03:03:16.464 --> 03:03:16.984]  Virginia.
[03:03:17.004 --> 03:03:19.886]  Alright, former great state of Virginia, George Washington State.
[03:03:20.267 --> 03:03:21.588]  Fall into the multinationals.
[03:03:21.608 --> 03:03:21.968]  Go ahead.
[03:03:23.689 --> 03:03:29.913]  I just wanted to first off tell you I'm enjoying my brain force, my X2 and my knockout.
[03:03:31.734 --> 03:03:31.995]  Thank you.
[03:03:32.095 --> 03:03:33.336]  I also wanted to
[03:03:35.054 --> 03:03:43.277]  Tell you that you inspired me to write a novel based on all this, this technocracy that's being set up.
[03:03:43.358 --> 03:03:45.198]  You have done well, Lord Vader.
[03:03:47.459 --> 03:03:52.801]  And it's called The Technocracy Confessions, The Rise of the Cybernetic Armageddon.
[03:03:53.522 --> 03:03:56.283]  Is it available on some type of e-book deal?
[03:03:58.704 --> 03:04:03.466]  I'm currently getting it reviewed by an editor, but it's going to be published probably
[03:04:04.156 --> 03:04:06.458]  Early winter, like around December, January.
[03:04:06.578 --> 03:04:06.978]  Good, good.
[03:04:08.499 --> 03:04:19.486]  And I wanted to ask you, because I have a niece and she was actually kicked out of school for knowing what 9-11 was.
[03:04:20.146 --> 03:04:23.949]  Oh yeah, all over America you say vaccines are bad, kicked out.
[03:04:23.969 --> 03:04:27.972]  They're teaching under political correctness all speech can be deemed evil, thought crime.
[03:04:28.766 --> 03:04:30.707]  But what's more liberal than thought crime?
[03:04:30.767 --> 03:04:31.727]  So liberal!
[03:04:32.227 --> 03:04:37.049]  Only thing more liberal is the pedophiles being legalized or pouring Drano in your eyes.
[03:04:37.069 --> 03:04:37.789]  It's like Hellraiser.
[03:04:38.029 --> 03:04:39.030]  We have the children!
[03:04:39.390 --> 03:04:39.570]  Ah!
[03:04:39.590 --> 03:04:40.190]  Drano!
[03:04:40.790 --> 03:04:40.890]  Ah!
[03:04:40.910 --> 03:04:42.451]  It's like Demon Possessed people would do.
[03:04:42.611 --> 03:04:43.231]  We're liberal!
[03:04:43.411 --> 03:04:44.032]  Drano!
[03:04:44.172 --> 03:04:44.292]  Ah!
[03:04:44.492 --> 03:04:45.852]  Chop your arms off, liberal!
[03:04:46.132 --> 03:04:46.272]  Ah!
[03:04:46.652 --> 03:04:48.033]  You know, your five-year-old's long ass!
[03:04:48.093 --> 03:04:48.433]  Ah!
[03:04:50.834 --> 03:04:51.834]  I'm sorry, brother.
[03:04:52.435 --> 03:04:52.755]  I'm sorry.
[03:04:52.775 --> 03:04:53.135]  Go ahead.
[03:04:53.155 --> 03:04:53.335]  What?
[03:04:54.289 --> 03:05:03.931]  I was in the store with my girlfriend and I saw a phone from the Veterans of Foreign Wars and I told him I think it's really messed up that all the Marines and sailors get treated and he about threw a tantrum right there.
[03:05:04.671 --> 03:05:08.131]  Oh yeah, no, no, no, because those are the little managers meant to keep control of the vets.
[03:05:08.752 --> 03:05:09.192]  We'll be back.
[03:05:10.612 --> 03:05:18.133]  Presidential candidates today strategize over every last detail of a candidate's image, especially an identity candidate like Hillary.
[03:05:18.433 --> 03:05:22.034]  How important is it for there to be a woman president in the United States?
[03:05:22.830 --> 03:05:29.093]  The National Journal has pointed out that candidates now view soundtracks as a key part of that carefully crafted image.
[03:05:30.033 --> 03:05:34.315]  So, maybe Hillary should choose a campaign song that plays against type.
[03:05:34.455 --> 03:05:35.616]  You know, humble.
[03:05:38.496 --> 03:05:44.359]  Hillary has paid a consulting firm $9,000 to create a soundtrack for her campaign.
[03:05:45.019 --> 03:05:47.641]  I just don't think people would believe this song, though.
[03:05:48.321 --> 03:05:54.584]  She's being abandoned by unions, by multinational corporate donors who are worried.
[03:05:54.604 --> 03:05:58.186]  44% of her Twitter followers, 1.4 million, are fake.
[03:05:58.786 --> 03:06:01.508]  Maybe her campaign theme should be... Help!
[03:06:02.248 --> 03:06:03.309]  I need somebody!
[03:06:03.369 --> 03:06:04.049]  Help!
[03:06:04.429 --> 03:06:06.050]  Not just anybody!
[03:06:06.130 --> 03:06:07.991]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:06:10.447 --> 03:06:11.228]  Alex Jones here.
[03:06:11.388 --> 03:06:27.958]  InfowarsStore.com is now partnering with the top-of-the-line storable food company, My Patriot Supply, to bring you the highest quality, freshest, longest-lasting, most affordable storable foods, private-labeled, from InfowarsSelect.com, at the lowest price you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:06:28.078 --> 03:06:29.639]  The globalists want us dependent.
[03:06:29.800 --> 03:06:31.281]  We need to be self-sufficient.
[03:06:31.401 --> 03:06:36.564]  And if you don't have high-quality, long-lasting, storable foods, I believe you're making a huge mistake.
[03:06:36.744 --> 03:06:39.227]  My goal is to find the best deals and bring it to you.
[03:06:39.447 --> 03:06:44.572]  Now is the time to take action and to secure your pantry for any emergency.
[03:06:44.672 --> 03:06:48.416]  You can buy all the great MyPatriotSupply products at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:06:48.476 --> 03:06:51.940]  They're the exact same products inside InfowarsSelect.com.
[03:06:52.020 --> 03:06:55.804]  Visit InfowarsSelect.com or InfowarsStore.com today.
[03:06:56.044 --> 03:06:56.585]  We're good.
[03:07:10.981 --> 03:07:14.463]  Products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[03:07:14.663 --> 03:07:18.865]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[03:07:18.905 --> 03:07:26.188]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[03:07:26.368 --> 03:07:36.893]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[03:07:37.033 --> 03:07:40.375]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[03:07:40.555 --> 03:07:41.576]  What do you have to lose?
[03:07:41.696 --> 03:07:44.397]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and
[03:07:44.517 --> 03:07:50.001]  You're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[03:07:50.121 --> 03:07:53.324]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[03:07:53.424 --> 03:07:57.447]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[03:07:57.627 --> 03:07:59.749]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[03:07:59.949 --> 03:08:06.895]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:08:13.038 --> 03:08:15.259]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:15.279 --> 03:08:18.581]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.601 --> 03:08:21.603]  I mean, this is... I'm not joking around about these people.
[03:08:36.092 --> 03:08:37.093]  Let's get serious, though.
[03:08:37.113 --> 03:08:38.954]  We're going to go to Leanne McAdoo for the rest of the hour.
[03:08:40.015 --> 03:08:41.476]  Alex Jones here in the fourth hour.
[03:08:42.156 --> 03:08:47.520]  Francis Hollande, Muslim rift, threatens total war.
[03:08:48.440 --> 03:08:54.504]  So the West, and France has been the biggest pusher of it, I mean, of any group, they've given more money per capita.
[03:08:54.784 --> 03:08:55.505]  Everybody's involved.
[03:08:57.136 --> 03:08:58.497]  More money than the Western countries.
[03:08:58.537 --> 03:09:01.439]  Turkey's probably giving more than anybody, or more military.
[03:09:01.499 --> 03:09:02.560]  Saudi Arabia's giving more money.
[03:09:03.360 --> 03:09:11.106]  He says, if we let recent religious confrontations between Shiites and Sunnis get worse, then don't think we won't be affected.
[03:09:11.226 --> 03:09:12.127]  It will be total war.
[03:09:12.207 --> 03:09:17.210]  See, that way, when there's this clash, and then tens of millions of refugees, he'll say, see, I told you it'd be a genius.
[03:09:17.550 --> 03:09:22.334]  No, see, we told you four years ago what the Arab Spring was, that it was going to be this.
[03:09:23.395 --> 03:09:24.515]  It's not hard to know this.
[03:09:25.276 --> 03:09:26.237]  It will be total war.
[03:09:27.429 --> 03:09:30.492]  A war that will also affect our territories.
[03:09:30.652 --> 03:09:31.833]  And we must act, he warned.
[03:09:32.753 --> 03:09:39.279]  Hollande also said that the political solution for Syria and Europe's illegal immigration crisis is the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
[03:09:40.440 --> 03:09:45.984]  Which, again, is the Sunni, Saudi Arabian-run attack on the Shiites.
[03:09:46.685 --> 03:09:49.547]  So he's driving the war while saying we've got to stop it.
[03:09:51.042 --> 03:09:55.605]  Middle East experts agree the situation has the potential to develop into full-scale war.
[03:09:55.625 --> 03:09:56.525]  Oh, it already is.
[03:09:57.166 --> 03:09:59.287]  The conditions are very much like 1914.
[03:09:59.747 --> 03:10:09.493]  Michael Stephens of the Royal United Service Institute in London said in June, prior to the Russian response in Syria, all it will take is one little spark and Iran and Saudi Arabia will go at each other.
[03:10:09.853 --> 03:10:11.974]  Believing they are fighting a defensive war, Stephens said.
[03:10:12.314 --> 03:10:14.335]  The whole region is bracing for a big war.
[03:10:14.595 --> 03:10:16.196]  The war that has not yet happened.
[03:10:16.416 --> 03:10:18.037]  The Shiite-Sunni war.
[03:10:18.518 --> 03:10:18.778]  Added.
[03:10:20.520 --> 03:10:23.763]  The Iraq Kurdish commentator, Hawi Osman.
[03:10:24.904 --> 03:10:40.958]  Stephen's remark about 1914 refers to the start of First World War, started by British intelligence, the fall of the Sunni Ottoman Empire and the Caliphate, and the Sykes-Picot Agreement between England, France, and the divided up Arab world, and of course the Versailles Treaty, I would add.
[03:10:41.458 --> 03:10:45.922]  So far, as Syria is concerned, it is France and not Turkey that is the enemy.
[03:10:46.142 --> 03:10:47.903]  The British agent and scholar
[03:10:49.048 --> 03:10:49.769]  T.E.
[03:10:49.829 --> 03:10:50.850]  Lawrence wrote in 1915.
[03:10:53.052 --> 03:11:06.044]  Because Lawrence of Arabia and all of this was a replay with the newly formed mercenary Bedouin groups that they gave machine guns and hand grenades to and rocket launchers and other goodies.
[03:11:09.267 --> 03:11:11.349]  And then they just ran around slaughtering everybody.
[03:11:11.630 --> 03:11:13.491]  There was a civilization there, it was
[03:11:15.580 --> 03:11:16.781]  More pro-Western.
[03:11:17.862 --> 03:11:19.142]  It was not as violent.
[03:11:19.182 --> 03:11:20.844]  People weren't really fighting with each other.
[03:11:21.284 --> 03:11:27.388]  And British intelligence went into the middle of Saudi Arabia and found basically the Duck Dynasty people of the area.
[03:11:27.408 --> 03:11:41.978]  And I'm not knocking Duck Dynasty, but they found the hillbillies and the folks that have been robbing the caravans coming into Mecca for a thousand years and just said, Hassan Chop, are you ready to take over?
[03:11:43.086 --> 03:11:43.987]  Yes, Master!
[03:11:44.487 --> 03:11:46.068]  I will kill!
[03:11:46.468 --> 03:11:55.174]  And now, the sons, the youngest sons, well, they're always dying every year or so, or having strokes constantly.
[03:11:55.535 --> 03:12:03.820]  There's like all these 85, 90-year-old sons of the guy that was having kids until he was like 75 years old, launched the war in 1901.
[03:12:04.181 --> 03:12:06.582]  Let's pull up the founder of the Saudi Empire.
[03:12:07.043 --> 03:12:11.045]  And then I'm going to play this Keksi clip, get it ready, because this is both the Saudi Arabian leader,
[03:12:11.986 --> 03:12:14.453]  This got censored on YouTube last time we put this up.
[03:12:15.095 --> 03:12:19.568]  When the last Saudi king died, well the one before the last, the older brother.
[03:12:20.333 --> 03:12:22.214]  Because I think they're down to like number fourth brother right now.
[03:12:22.594 --> 03:12:46.625]  The emergence of the Saudi dynasty began in Central Arabia in 1744, in the year Muhammad ibn Sa'd, the tribal ruler of the town of Adir, joined forces with the religious leader Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhaba, that's the Wahhabist, the founder of the Wahhabi movement, a radical form of Islam.
[03:12:46.965 --> 03:12:48.566]  Yeah, but the modern founder.
[03:12:49.326 --> 03:12:50.026]  The modern founder.
[03:12:50.046 --> 03:12:50.806]  I forget his name.
[03:12:51.967 --> 03:12:54.388]  The modern founder of the House of Saad.
[03:12:54.408 --> 03:12:54.388]  1901.
[03:12:55.908 --> 03:12:56.688]  Wasn't official until like 1930.
[03:12:56.768 --> 03:12:57.268]  I'll do it.
[03:12:59.789 --> 03:13:00.329]  That's not a big deal.
[03:13:00.349 --> 03:13:01.430]  You can't find it, but I'll try here.
[03:13:02.230 --> 03:13:03.430]  Um, there it is.
[03:13:03.490 --> 03:13:04.210]  How do you pronounce that?
[03:13:04.230 --> 03:13:06.811]  Because I can't see it.
[03:13:06.851 --> 03:13:07.371]  It's too far away.
[03:13:07.391 --> 03:13:08.172]  Just jump on the mic with me.
[03:13:08.712 --> 03:13:09.712]  Abdul Aziz.
[03:13:10.212 --> 03:13:12.333]  Abdul Aziz died 1953.
[03:13:12.913 --> 03:13:15.934]  King Saad succeeded to the throne of his father.
[03:13:17.355 --> 03:13:19.198]  And then it goes, yeah, yeah, and let's click on him.
[03:13:19.218 --> 03:13:25.388]  And he's the guy that got funded by the British to be able to do all this.
[03:13:28.312 --> 03:13:28.513]  Yep.
[03:13:29.735 --> 03:13:30.977]  Saud of Saudi Arabia.
[03:13:33.120 --> 03:13:34.941]  Yeah, he was the second in line.
[03:13:35.201 --> 03:13:36.102]  It's his father.
[03:13:36.883 --> 03:13:38.604]  So CTRL-F FATHER and click that.
[03:13:38.644 --> 03:13:39.504]  See, it's the link before it.
[03:13:39.524 --> 03:13:39.885]  Good job.
[03:13:40.305 --> 03:13:41.646]  And look, the guys are doing a great job.
[03:13:41.766 --> 03:13:43.787]  I'm not mad that they go to this stuff so quickly.
[03:13:44.048 --> 03:13:44.668]  I'm happy they are.
[03:13:44.728 --> 03:13:51.172]  It's just, it's meant to be train-wreck-y so everybody can just see how we're making claims here, then going and showing you.
[03:13:52.133 --> 03:13:58.958]  99% of the time, 97% of the time, depending on, I'm accurate, but it's always good to refresh your memory and it's all a fun game to learn how all this works.
[03:14:00.452 --> 03:14:01.413]  But, uh, there you go.
[03:14:01.493 --> 03:14:02.253]  Yeah, there he is.
[03:14:02.433 --> 03:14:04.434]  You notice all his sons look exactly like him today.
[03:14:04.454 --> 03:14:07.196]  Uh, they're saying one of them's had a stroke or something today.
[03:14:07.216 --> 03:14:08.636]  Um, but there he is.
[03:14:08.676 --> 03:14:10.357]  Let's, let's give his whole title here.
[03:14:10.918 --> 03:14:15.580]  He controlled a couple hundred square miles till British intelligence, uh, basically gave him the whole area.
[03:14:15.600 --> 03:14:17.461]  Uh, let's, let's pronounce it.
[03:14:17.481 --> 03:14:18.142]  How do you pronounce that?
[03:14:19.122 --> 03:14:29.911]  Abdulaziz, Abin, Abdul, Rahman, Abin, Fazl, Ib, Turkey, Turki, Ibin, Abdullah, Ibn, Mohammed, Al Saad.
[03:14:29.951 --> 03:14:31.672]  I'm sure I butchered it on purpose, I don't care.
[03:14:32.913 --> 03:14:37.797]  And they've been perching and feeding on Arabs and Muslims forever, just delusionally out of their minds.
[03:14:38.177 --> 03:14:41.700]  These are the guys that would grab women, you know, off their caravans and go sell them.
[03:14:41.740 --> 03:14:43.662]  I mean, they're just the trash of the planet.
[03:14:45.283 --> 03:14:46.224]  They're highway robbers.
[03:14:48.621 --> 03:14:50.602]  Another little gift from British intelligence.
[03:14:51.102 --> 03:14:57.765]  So, we do have footage, ladies and gentlemen, of, well, just a Saudi meeting, but with Hillary.
[03:14:58.365 --> 03:15:02.307]  And so, let's go ahead and play this exclusive footage right now.
[03:15:02.427 --> 03:15:03.327]  Ladies and gentlemen, here it is.
[03:15:21.389 --> 03:15:22.950]  You know, I say those are ugly creatures.
[03:15:23.810 --> 03:15:28.234]  I'm being racist against Skeksis, so... I think they're beautiful.
[03:15:28.414 --> 03:15:32.818]  Oh, look at them.
[03:15:32.998 --> 03:15:39.263]  Can I date that creature?
[03:15:39.283 --> 03:15:40.444]  I want to date Hillary.
[03:15:41.084 --> 03:15:42.585]  Oh, look, Hillary's in fine health.
[03:15:43.086 --> 03:15:43.726]  Everything's fine.
[03:15:43.746 --> 03:15:45.288]  It's a conspiracy theory that she's sick.
[03:15:46.465 --> 03:15:47.726]  She's just laying her head down to rest.
[03:15:47.766 --> 03:15:49.407]  She's just, middle of the campaign trail, you know.
[03:15:49.947 --> 03:15:50.687]  Not having a good day.
[03:15:51.208 --> 03:15:52.208]  Her campaign's not crumbling.
[03:15:53.109 --> 03:15:54.209]  Everything's fine.
[03:15:54.269 --> 03:15:56.450]  Joe Biden's not looking over her, ready to run any moment.
[03:15:58.251 --> 03:15:58.552]  No, no, no.
[03:15:58.592 --> 03:16:00.693]  She didn't have a second set of emails to cover anything up.
[03:16:01.893 --> 03:16:02.814]  She doesn't want your guys.
[03:16:02.994 --> 03:16:03.094]  Oh.
[03:16:04.395 --> 03:16:04.475]  Oh.
[03:16:06.111 --> 03:16:06.751]  Hillary's doing fine.
[03:16:06.771 --> 03:16:07.452]  Her campaign's great.
[03:16:07.472 --> 03:16:08.692]  She's not crumbling.
[03:16:09.273 --> 03:16:09.793]  Not crumbling.
[03:16:10.073 --> 03:16:12.774]  Or she's crumbling on screen, but I... That's a conspiracy theory.
[03:16:12.814 --> 03:16:13.735]  I mean, my own eyes are lying.
[03:16:13.755 --> 03:16:14.695]  I should pour Drano in them.
[03:16:14.895 --> 03:16:15.455]  They're a sin.
[03:16:15.776 --> 03:16:17.897]  It's... Mother's never breastfed.
[03:16:17.937 --> 03:16:18.717]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[03:16:18.897 --> 03:16:20.077]  We never had things called eyes.
[03:16:20.258 --> 03:16:20.998]  We could never see.
[03:16:21.618 --> 03:16:21.818]  No.
[03:16:22.118 --> 03:16:22.298]  No.
[03:16:22.599 --> 03:16:23.179]  I love government.
[03:16:24.170 --> 03:16:25.050]  It made the sun shine.
[03:16:25.090 --> 03:16:25.851]  It made the birds tweet.
[03:16:26.471 --> 03:16:29.072]  All right, let's go down to Leanne McAdoo, who will be hosting the rest of the broadcast.
[03:16:29.312 --> 03:16:31.873]  Has a big fourth hour lined up for us.
[03:16:32.193 --> 03:16:37.995]  Leanne McAdoo, what did you think of Matt Drudge appearing yesterday in the confines of the InfoWars Command Center?
[03:16:38.275 --> 03:16:39.715]  That was shocking.
[03:16:39.775 --> 03:16:42.616]  I was flabbergasted, as you said.
[03:16:42.716 --> 03:16:43.357]  I was as well.
[03:16:44.517 --> 03:16:46.839]  Pretty surreal to see him here.
[03:16:47.059 --> 03:16:53.003]  I didn't really recognize him at first because he hasn't had any photographs taken in the last eight years.
[03:16:53.463 --> 03:16:55.084]  So he knew who I was.
[03:16:55.104 --> 03:16:59.167]  I mean, he was an incredibly classy man, made everyone here feel really special.
[03:16:59.227 --> 03:17:01.348]  And it was just it was pretty cool.
[03:17:01.388 --> 03:17:03.089]  Do you have a crush on Matt Drudge now?
[03:17:04.050 --> 03:17:06.672]  You know, he looks younger now than he did in his pictures.
[03:17:06.712 --> 03:17:08.093]  I think it's because he's more relaxed.
[03:17:08.925 --> 03:17:16.489]  Well, plus he told me, I don't know if that's a secret, I think he said this, the straw hat was something he did on purpose so that's all the media ever had.
[03:17:17.329 --> 03:17:23.372]  So that once he disappeared, this was all planned, really classy guy, he would then dress different and no one knows who he is.
[03:17:24.073 --> 03:17:27.655]  I'm not gonna, well, I'm not gonna say how he was dressed, but let's just say he fit in around Texas.
[03:17:27.955 --> 03:17:28.195]  Yeah.
[03:17:28.715 --> 03:17:30.096]  He didn't have a hipster beard though.
[03:17:32.317 --> 03:17:32.797]  Or Austin.
[03:17:33.277 --> 03:17:34.238]  He didn't have a beard.
[03:17:34.258 --> 03:17:37.680]  No, that's what I'm saying though, if he wants to fit in here in Austin,
[03:17:38.399 --> 03:17:41.201]  Oh, he did have a giant handlebar mustache like Richard's though.
[03:17:42.823 --> 03:17:45.885]  No, Drudge has a big black mustache now that he curls at the ends.
[03:17:45.905 --> 03:17:46.146]  Yes.
[03:17:46.586 --> 03:17:47.407]  Like Stromboli.
[03:17:47.547 --> 03:17:50.229]  He's gonna grow it out even longer for Movember.
[03:17:50.469 --> 03:18:03.741]  But I'm looking at the Drudge Report right now and he's got a whole sidebar here talking about the gun sales, setting new records, why would-be killers target gun-free zones, five steps to a gun-free America, but it looks like he needs to update the site.
[03:18:04.341 --> 03:18:07.742]  With our article on the hashtag Disarm Obama.
[03:18:07.922 --> 03:18:11.564]  Well, last night he said, I think the most important thing was Disarm Obama.
[03:18:11.584 --> 03:18:17.346]  You ought to do a story on that, which I'd actually said when I left, but I get there's a lot of great stuff, so I'm sure that when he, he has been updating, I don't know.
[03:18:17.566 --> 03:18:17.766]  Yes.
[03:18:18.146 --> 03:18:22.068]  At some point, I think he will promote that article because we need to get that going mega-viral.
[03:18:22.688 --> 03:18:23.909]  After all, it is his initiative.
[03:18:23.989 --> 03:18:25.049]  Obama, give up your guns.
[03:18:25.869 --> 03:18:27.190]  Hashtag Disarm Obama.
[03:18:27.510 --> 03:18:32.812]  Please, the staff, the crew, everyone listening, Facebook, Twitter, help get that article out to everybody.
[03:18:33.112 --> 03:18:33.733]  But I'm not complaining.
[03:18:33.753 --> 03:18:35.214]  I think he's linked to four of our articles.
[03:18:35.415 --> 03:18:35.615]  Yeah.
[03:18:35.935 --> 03:18:38.979]  And he went to three of them yesterday, so we're not complaining.
[03:18:39.019 --> 03:18:47.608]  Joe Biggs will be reporting from the big Tactical Gun Expo in Florida tomorrow to get their response to gun sales and the latest on what's happening there.
[03:18:47.989 --> 03:18:53.074]  Leanne McAdoo, what do you think of the West starting the Arab Civil War?
[03:18:54.281 --> 03:19:03.564]  The Muslim Civil War between the Shiites and the Sunnis, between the Persians and the bank robber, caravan robbers that run Saudi Arabia.
[03:19:04.144 --> 03:19:05.444]  What do you think about all that?
[03:19:05.524 --> 03:19:06.465]  Pretty serious situation.
[03:19:06.825 --> 03:19:16.708]  Well it's absolutely serious and you can just see the blatant hypocrisy there with this administration because Obama's coming out saying we need to use diplomacy and we need gun control.
[03:19:17.028 --> 03:19:21.629]  Meanwhile he's making billions of dollars worth of arms contracts there in the Middle East.
[03:19:21.929 --> 03:19:23.670]  So he's saying... Well, they're arming the rebels.
[03:19:23.830 --> 03:19:24.070]  Right.
[03:19:24.110 --> 03:19:25.330]  Why are you being racist?
[03:19:25.430 --> 03:19:28.952]  On the exact same day, he's pushing for gun control here in America.
[03:19:29.152 --> 03:19:34.694]  He wants all of us to be disarmed, but then he is heavily arming our enemies.
[03:19:34.754 --> 03:19:35.154]  Absolutely.
[03:19:35.194 --> 03:19:37.455]  Leanne, what do you got coming up with Noel Sharkey, the professor?
[03:19:37.735 --> 03:19:39.315]  Saw a story yesterday going viral.
[03:19:39.876 --> 03:19:42.377]  Weaponized robots are inevitable, so submit to them.
[03:19:42.637 --> 03:19:43.377]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:19:43.397 --> 03:19:51.460]  The risk of robotic warfare is closer than ever because the UN is delaying some negotiations there that would stall it.
[03:19:51.900 --> 03:20:02.413]  Well, they've already got autonomous weapons and the Pentagon doesn't even like it, but the Science Board, means eugenics globalist, actually says we're going ahead with the merger with the machines, Leanne.
[03:20:02.674 --> 03:20:04.216]  Why are you being phobic against machines?
[03:20:04.236 --> 03:20:08.001]  Next you're going to be phobic against pedophilia, phobic against pouring Drano in your eyes.
[03:20:08.041 --> 03:20:09.502]  What type of sick freak are you?
[03:20:10.953 --> 03:20:15.097]  Do you lay awake at night and worry about the health and safety of you and your loved ones?
[03:20:15.117 --> 03:20:19.161]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?

[03:23:05.417 --> 03:23:14.745]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[03:23:14.925 --> 03:23:18.828]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[03:23:18.988 --> 03:23:23.212]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[03:23:26.334 --> 03:23:31.375]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?

[03:23:43.459 --> 03:23:43.699]  I think so.
[03:24:23.724 --> 03:24:26.987]  Alright, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:27.067 --> 03:24:30.449]  You are listening to the 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:24:30.469 --> 03:24:32.210]  We are going to be wrapping up the show.
[03:24:32.230 --> 03:24:35.833]  I've got a jam-packed rest of the 4th Hour for you.
[03:24:36.594 --> 03:24:45.120]  I wanted to talk about something that Matt Drudge came here yesterday and it was an epic experience for me and he was dropping pearls of wisdom.
[03:24:45.620 --> 03:24:52.606]  One of the big things that really stuck with me, he was talking about this terrifying power of tech giants.
[03:24:53.286 --> 03:25:02.228]  And of course, wouldn't you know, there's an article out today, Steve Jobs director Danny Boyle warns of the terrifying power of tech giants.
[03:25:02.829 --> 03:25:08.890]  And he says that it's actually this terrifying power that prompted him to go ahead and work on this movie.
[03:25:09.530 --> 03:25:22.594]  After he finished reading the novel The Circle, that novel features a vast Facebook, Apple, Twitter-like system encompassing and controlling the entire
[03:25:23.817 --> 03:25:46.919]  platform of any kind of digital communication that's out there and he said that these companies are so powerful the governments are running scared they have such influence around the world they've replaced petrochemical companies pharmaceutical companies they're bigger than all of them put together and now they have tremendous terrifying power we should keep an eye on them absolutely and we're always talking about how there are these
[03:25:47.359 --> 03:25:54.301]  Six megacorporations that rule everything from the media, to the news, to the food, to industry, etc.
[03:25:54.601 --> 03:25:57.001]  Well now that's happening with the Internet.
[03:25:58.082 --> 03:26:00.642]  They are controlling the world, essentially.
[03:26:01.082 --> 03:26:05.323]  And the Internet, Matt Drudge was saying, you know, it's the Wild Wild West.
[03:26:05.363 --> 03:26:08.644]  It used to be sort of this renaissance area.
[03:26:09.204 --> 03:26:14.405]  And now we are being corralled into these ghettos that they are controlling.
[03:26:14.425 --> 03:26:15.446]  And I thought that was a really
[03:26:16.926 --> 03:26:25.209]  Apropos term that he uses, well, because he's saying these corporate controlled social media, they're killing the open range of ideas on the Internet.
[03:26:26.229 --> 03:26:32.371]  And he calls Facebook and Twitter, Internet ghettos, designed to eradicate the open range of independent thought.
[03:26:33.607 --> 03:26:36.331]  Where are the vibrant entities that are out there?
[03:26:36.371 --> 03:26:48.446]  That's why he loves Alex Jones so much and why he was able to create this huge following, this huge platform because he didn't worry about the Facebooks and the Google and the links and the Yahoo and the Bing.
[03:26:48.466 --> 03:26:49.507]  He wasn't worried about that.
[03:26:49.988 --> 03:26:51.910]  It was just this organic
[03:26:52.691 --> 03:26:55.492]  Truthfulness that attracted everyone to it.
[03:26:56.112 --> 03:27:03.594]  And that's the thing is that they don't want you to be able to have another sort of entity waking people up out there.
[03:27:03.694 --> 03:27:12.456]  They want everyone to corral over to the YouTubes and to the Instagrams and to the Facebooks because they don't want you to take that mythical hero's journey.
[03:27:13.057 --> 03:27:18.758]  The hero's journey is what is going to make everyone successful in their own way.
[03:27:18.858 --> 03:27:21.479]  Kid Daniels points out in this article
[03:27:22.472 --> 03:27:23.112]  We're good to go.
[03:27:44.125 --> 03:27:49.290]  You're going to be likely to share your same views and they already know everything you're going to be talking about.
[03:27:49.690 --> 03:27:59.419]  So your potential to reach outside of Facebook or to be introduced to any ideas that are different than your own are corralled.
[03:27:59.619 --> 03:28:01.040]  You're going to be stopped from that.
[03:28:01.841 --> 03:28:11.644]  And the establishment wants this because in a closed network, you're also more likely to repeatedly hear the same government talking points and accept them without thought.
[03:28:11.724 --> 03:28:16.606]  And of course, that means you're going to be more easily controlled by the power elite.
[03:28:16.846 --> 03:28:24.268]  And that, of course, is why they do not want you to take that hero's journey, which is the number one indicator of success.
[03:28:24.828 --> 03:28:31.114]  Matt Drudge says, don't be fooled into thinking that you're an individual when you're on Facebook.
[03:28:31.234 --> 03:28:31.734]  You're not.
[03:28:31.975 --> 03:28:34.057]  You're just a pawn in their scheme.
[03:28:34.637 --> 03:28:38.440]  And that for me was one of the most profound things that he spoke about yesterday.
[03:28:38.460 --> 03:28:45.507]  Of course, he mentioned a lot of other things like, hashtag disarm Obama, which we want that to go viral.
[03:28:45.527 --> 03:28:48.309]  Be sure that you're sharing that video as well as that article.
[03:28:49.630 --> 03:28:53.674]  But what is this hero's journey that I'm speaking about?
[03:28:53.734 --> 03:28:59.780]  You see it, it's this myth that's the fabric of our society and you see it in every movie, every book.
[03:29:00.080 --> 03:29:02.002]  The Matrix is a perfect example of that.
[03:29:03.786 --> 03:29:09.551]  Things are going great, you feel normal, you fit in, then all of a sudden something happens to change your perception of the world.
[03:29:09.731 --> 03:29:11.632]  You start to feel like an outsider on your own.
[03:29:12.073 --> 03:29:19.338]  You're called to leave and fulfill a part of yourself, a destiny, but that has a lot of uncertainty to it, so you're scared.
[03:29:19.859 --> 03:29:31.208]  Finally, you take the plunge, you go through some difficult times, but then you learn to navigate and you overcome these challenges and then you're able to go back to your old culture and you have a huge impact
[03:29:31.408 --> 03:29:37.590]  on the world around you, taking all the lessons that you've learned, and that's exactly what they do not want you to do.
[03:29:37.650 --> 03:29:39.210]  They don't want you to take that hero's journey.
[03:29:39.630 --> 03:29:46.972]  They want you to stay in their little ghetto so they can suck out your soul and your essence, just like the Skeksis there.
[03:29:47.993 --> 03:29:52.474]  That movie is still such the appropriate allegory for our time, The Dark Crystal.
[03:29:53.814 --> 03:29:55.755]  We'll be right back with Noel Sharkey.
[03:30:00.069 --> 03:30:03.075]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:04.016 --> 03:30:06.701]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:11.027 --> 03:30:15.348]  Matt Drudge challenges Barack Obama to give up his guns.
[03:30:15.788 --> 03:30:21.970]  The news icon calls on the President and Hillary Clinton to relinquish their Secret Service protection.
[03:30:22.190 --> 03:30:23.371]  I challenge Hillary.
[03:30:23.631 --> 03:30:25.151]  Take away your Secret Service.
[03:30:25.431 --> 03:30:26.332]  Take it away now.
[03:30:26.472 --> 03:30:27.732]  Have no security around you.
[03:30:28.052 --> 03:30:29.493]  Have no guns around you, Hillary.
[03:30:29.833 --> 03:30:30.553]  I dare you.
[03:30:30.733 --> 03:30:31.233]  I dare you.
[03:30:31.593 --> 03:30:32.553]  Obama, same thing.
[03:30:32.793 --> 03:30:34.074]  Drop your guns, Obama.
[03:30:34.844 --> 03:30:36.766]  Take your secret service away, Obama.
[03:30:36.926 --> 03:30:38.067]  Take it all away.
[03:30:38.227 --> 03:30:40.109]  Leave the White House unguarded, Obama.
[03:30:40.229 --> 03:30:43.131]  Let everybody know there's no guns on the White House grounds, Obama.
[03:30:43.191 --> 03:30:44.793]  You know what would happen in 30 seconds?
[03:30:45.093 --> 03:30:47.095]  Both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth.
[03:30:47.796 --> 03:30:48.776]  So they're asking us!
[03:30:49.656 --> 03:30:54.678]  To drop our guns and to drop our security measures or, or what?
[03:30:55.178 --> 03:31:01.139]  So this thing is very real and I don't see how it's being taken seriously except for the sick voter.
[03:31:01.520 --> 03:31:05.561]  That was yesterday during a surprise appearance on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:31:05.721 --> 03:31:08.742]  You can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[03:31:10.839 --> 03:31:12.059]  Another major health threat.
[03:31:12.099 --> 03:31:17.000]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[03:31:17.080 --> 03:31:19.701]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[03:31:19.741 --> 03:31:26.523]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[03:31:26.783 --> 03:31:29.663]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[03:31:29.783 --> 03:31:32.724]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[03:31:32.744 --> 03:31:34.724]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[03:31:34.744 --> 03:31:37.605]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[03:31:37.705 --> 03:31:43.186]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[03:31:43.406 --> 03:31:46.907]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[03:31:46.927 --> 03:31:49.887]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[03:31:50.008 --> 03:31:57.109]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[03:33:07.366 --> 03:33:19.570]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:33:20.191 --> 03:33:23.172]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:31.590 --> 03:33:33.372]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:33.452 --> 03:33:35.735]  This is the 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:33:36.035 --> 03:33:38.258]  I am Leanne McAdoo, your host.
[03:33:38.898 --> 03:33:46.927]  Now, the United Nations has been warned that delays in negotiations over the future of lethal autonomous weapons or killer robots...
[03:33:47.628 --> 03:33:52.151]  They're moving too slowly to stop robot wars from becoming a reality.
[03:33:52.752 --> 03:34:06.622]  Now, experts including physicist Stephen Hawking, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, they've all warned that proliferation of autonomous weapons would make a global arms race inevitable.
[03:34:07.282 --> 03:34:07.442]  Now,
[03:34:08.599 --> 03:34:10.000]  My guest today is Noel Sharkey.
[03:34:10.080 --> 03:34:14.782]  He is the Emeritus Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at the University of Sheffield.
[03:34:15.262 --> 03:34:29.989]  And after years of detailed research within artificial intelligence and robotics, Noel's core research interest is in the ethical application of robotics and AI in areas such as the military, surveillance, and criminal terrorist activity.
[03:34:30.569 --> 03:34:36.190]  He's currently serving as chair of the NGO, the International Committee for Robot Arms Control.
[03:34:36.651 --> 03:34:40.332]  They're a group, they've been campaigning against the use of military robots.
[03:34:40.792 --> 03:34:42.472]  Noel, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:34:42.972 --> 03:34:45.433]  So talk to me a little bit about this stall at the UN.
[03:34:45.473 --> 03:34:46.113]  What does that mean?
[03:34:46.173 --> 03:34:49.614]  How is that setting us up for killer robot arms race?
[03:34:50.626 --> 03:35:05.215]  Well, there's a committee at the UN called the CCW, and that's the committee that's really designed for prohibiting certain sorts of weapons that are unnecessarily injurious, like fragments on the battlefield, landmines, those things.
[03:35:05.875 --> 03:35:11.078]  And we went to them, we got mandates from them, so they've run expert meetings.
[03:35:11.518 --> 03:35:15.521]  And they've run expert meetings two years in a row now, for five days each time.
[03:35:16.101 --> 03:35:20.264]  But no, we want them to move forward to the next stage of negotiation.
[03:35:20.704 --> 03:35:24.827]  But what they're saying is that next year, they're going to go for another expert meeting.
[03:35:24.887 --> 03:35:33.053]  And this is becoming like an annual conference instead of moving towards getting groups of government experts together and discussing a possible treaty.
[03:35:34.560 --> 03:35:37.742]  And so what do you believe is causing that delay?
[03:35:37.762 --> 03:35:51.509]  I know in one of the articles there, we have all of these ethicists warning of the potential dangers and yet they're stalling and we know that there are already some of these semi-autonomous weapons in use and the development of so much more.
[03:35:52.529 --> 03:35:54.110]  Yes, they're developing pretty quickly.
[03:35:54.130 --> 03:36:00.034]  The US have guidelines that prevent them being acquired for a period of five years.
[03:36:00.494 --> 03:36:02.796]  And there's, well, there's another two years to run on that.
[03:36:03.116 --> 03:36:09.520]  But in the meantime, DARPA, your Defence Advanced Project Research Agency, is developing like crazy, really.
[03:36:09.820 --> 03:36:18.285]  They keep issuing new contracts for tender, like they're looking at swarms of autonomous boats that can swarm another craft.
[03:36:18.565 --> 03:36:20.687]  They're looking at swarms of planes.
[03:36:21.147 --> 03:36:27.714]  They're looking at autonomous submarines that can go into the water and sink other submarines, but they could sink ships as well, of course.
[03:36:28.075 --> 03:36:31.258]  So the technology is developing and developing.
[03:36:31.719 --> 03:36:41.009]  And the point is, the language that the US and UK have insisted on using at the UN is that these are meetings about emerging technologies.
[03:36:41.730 --> 03:36:46.154]  Now China have said they want it to be about existing and emerging technologies.
[03:36:46.574 --> 03:37:00.345]  Now the problem with the wording emerging technologies, and it is an emerging technology, but if we keep on at this for another three or four years, by that point they will no longer be emerging, they'll be there, and so the treaty won't have any teeth to ban them.
[03:37:02.034 --> 03:37:12.760]  Wow, and then so the US and the UK are insisting that using this wording, I guess a lot of money is going into the development of these machines.
[03:37:13.274 --> 03:37:19.315]  Yes, but of course they're not saying that's why they're doing it, but it just strikes anybody with any sense that that's what's happening.
[03:37:19.715 --> 03:37:21.056]  But the machines are quite dangerous.
[03:37:21.076 --> 03:37:36.679]  I mean, they're really obviously, in the discussions, I've learnt an awful lot in the discussions, and I've been working in this campaigning since 2007, but I've learnt an awful lot at the UN in recent times about the kind of military reasons for having them.
[03:37:38.792 --> 03:37:52.547]  It's so important that all nations discuss this, because when the US talks about this, they seem to have this idea that they were developing them, and all other nations' technology will stay exactly as it is today.
[03:37:52.567 --> 03:37:56.091]  So when they're doing these kind of scenarios to test the weapons,
[03:37:56.531 --> 03:38:02.155]  They're thinking that China and Russia and these countries will have exactly the same weapons that they have today.
[03:38:02.556 --> 03:38:07.239]  Whereas in actual fact, what we're going to see is an arms race and mass proliferation.
[03:38:07.579 --> 03:38:09.461]  And at the moment, there's nothing against that.
[03:38:09.521 --> 03:38:11.723]  There are no laws against these whatsoever.
[03:38:12.223 --> 03:38:19.308]  So if we get mass proliferation and billions of dollars, because there's billions of dollars at stake here, big companies involved.
[03:38:19.649 --> 03:38:23.992]  If billions of dollars get involved, then, you know, how are we ever going to stop it?
[03:38:25.371 --> 03:38:34.757]  Exactly, and just speaking earlier about the terrifying power of tech giants, Google, as a matter of fact, they've jumped into airspace monitoring.
[03:38:35.058 --> 03:38:46.846]  They want to make room for drones there, so they want to control that airspace, but they've also recently acquired Boston Dynamics, so it's one of the most advanced robotics companies in the world making robots for the military.
[03:38:47.546 --> 03:38:48.846]  What does Google need with that?
[03:38:49.287 --> 03:38:49.607]  Five.
[03:38:49.867 --> 03:38:50.987]  Five robot companies.
[03:38:51.067 --> 03:38:51.707]  Major ones.
[03:38:51.767 --> 03:38:52.868]  All the best ones in the world.
[03:38:53.248 --> 03:38:58.469]  Now, Google said that they would only see out the existing contracts with the Boston Dynamics.
[03:38:59.049 --> 03:39:05.051]  So, they had a couple of years of contracts left for the military, and they said they wouldn't do anything more with the military.
[03:39:05.531 --> 03:39:06.432]  But what's happened?
[03:39:07.112 --> 03:39:14.414]  Just three weeks ago, I found out that there's a brand new Google robot, like the big dog that you all know, called Spot.
[03:39:14.994 --> 03:39:16.735]  And it's being tested by Marines.
[03:39:17.535 --> 03:39:22.737]  So, I don't know what Google are playing at here, what sort of game they're playing at, but it seems very strange to me.
[03:39:23.578 --> 03:39:30.360]  Yeah, absolutely, and to have the foresight there to go ahead and control the airspace that the drones are going to be flying in.
[03:39:30.680 --> 03:39:32.360]  So obviously something's going on.
[03:39:32.841 --> 03:39:34.121]  They're competing with Amazon.
[03:39:34.581 --> 03:39:41.083]  Amazon in Europe are trying at the moment with the regulators to get a whole portion of airspace.
[03:39:41.503 --> 03:39:46.625]  It's something like 200 yards and a thousand feet in the air.
[03:39:47.005 --> 03:39:51.186]  And they want to control that airspace so they can start doing a lot of Amazon deliveries.
[03:39:51.906 --> 03:39:54.530]  And I think Google and they are competing with each other for this.
[03:39:54.550 --> 03:39:55.411]  Right.
[03:39:55.891 --> 03:39:58.935]  I mean, that seems like a crazy idea as well, really.
[03:39:59.236 --> 03:40:04.042]  Because if you think about the number of deliveries, are we going to see the sun at all?
[03:40:04.062 --> 03:40:06.905]  I mean, the sky is just going to be littered with these things.
[03:40:07.286 --> 03:40:08.247]  And it's so easy.
[03:40:09.301 --> 03:40:17.164]  When you've got that kind of stream of stuff, to slip some machines with bombs in them onto that stream and we could never detect it.
[03:40:17.264 --> 03:40:18.624]  So it's very worrying.
[03:40:18.904 --> 03:40:23.086]  I mean, there's a whole worrying development outside of what we're talking about just now.
[03:40:23.106 --> 03:40:27.848]  And there's a whole worrying development with the police use of these technologies.
[03:40:28.268 --> 03:40:36.951]  And I don't know if you've heard there in Texas, but North Dakota this month, was last month, sorry, late last month, passed a new bill.
[03:40:38.171 --> 03:40:43.793]  Saying that the police are now allowed to arm their drones with less than lethal weapons.
[03:40:44.193 --> 03:40:56.097]  And that means that the North Dakota police now can arm their drones with tasers, with rubber bullets, firing rifles that fire rubber bullets, tear gas and a pepper spray.
[03:40:56.277 --> 03:41:01.639]  And this is a very, very worrying development to me because it gives the police too much power to control.
[03:41:03.200 --> 03:41:04.061]  Well, absolutely.
[03:41:04.121 --> 03:41:08.868]  In North Dakota, I mean, they don't even have that much of a population there.
[03:41:08.948 --> 03:41:13.694]  So why do they need to authorize their police to have armed drones?
[03:41:13.814 --> 03:41:17.619]  Well, they're one of the biggest drone users in the U.S., in fact, for some reason.
[03:41:17.659 --> 03:41:18.080]  I don't know why.
[03:41:18.220 --> 03:41:20.621]  Maybe it's because they don't have such a big population.
[03:41:21.321 --> 03:41:24.742]  But anything that starts there, it's like a domino effect, isn't it?
[03:41:24.902 --> 03:41:28.683]  They will test it out there, and if it works out well, it will spread.
[03:41:29.084 --> 03:41:35.686]  And already in South Africa, these tools are being used to suppress protests.
[03:41:36.006 --> 03:41:36.446]  Exactly.
[03:41:36.926 --> 03:41:38.927]  You know, you're going to see peaceful protest.
[03:41:39.188 --> 03:41:44.631]  Because the problem is that what you consider to be a peaceful protest can change over time.
[03:41:45.032 --> 03:41:45.912]  Laws can change.
[03:41:46.252 --> 03:41:49.815]  And the more control you have, you're not putting police officers in harm's way.
[03:41:50.155 --> 03:41:53.437]  You can fly overhead, fire pepper spray, fire tasers.
[03:41:53.778 --> 03:41:58.141]  So you start getting a large protest like Occupy Wall Street, that kind of thing.
[03:41:58.161 --> 03:42:04.285]  And, you know, the police can move in and pick people off and certainly photograph them and steal their private data.
[03:42:05.225 --> 03:42:15.752]  Oh absolutely, and we've just recently reported that the UN and the US, they're forming their global Stasi network, policing the globe basically.
[03:42:15.792 --> 03:42:23.417]  And we see Saudi Arabia is beheading two young men who were 17 at the time that they were arrested for protesting against the government.
[03:42:23.897 --> 03:42:27.460]  So of course they're going to be going after extremists.
[03:42:28.200 --> 03:42:37.327]  And those terrorists that they are actually looking for are people who are going to be against the totalitarianism of the state.
[03:42:37.887 --> 03:42:43.692]  It's not going to be actually people who are attaching bombs to these drones, such as they are.
[03:42:44.372 --> 03:42:45.313]  Exactly.
[03:42:45.333 --> 03:42:50.116]  Well, the problem with the word terrorism, sometimes we call them freedom fighters.
[03:42:50.196 --> 03:42:51.577]  It depends on what side you're on.
[03:42:52.598 --> 03:42:52.858]  Really.
[03:42:52.978 --> 03:43:00.963]  I mean, the United States used to bomb the Redcoats from civilians and nobody called, they certainly didn't call them terrorists in the United States when they did that.
[03:43:02.164 --> 03:43:10.029]  Sometimes it's the only way to, it's the only way for populations to stop an authoritarian government is to rise against it.
[03:43:10.409 --> 03:43:14.452]  And the more technological weapons you have, the harder that is, it really is.
[03:43:15.805 --> 03:43:16.446]  Absolutely.
[03:43:16.986 --> 03:43:24.433]  And then so, talking about the ethics with these military robots, can they get away with war crimes?
[03:43:24.934 --> 03:43:28.798]  If a robot unlawfully kills someone in the heat of battle, who's to blame?
[03:43:30.222 --> 03:43:34.566]  That's a very big problem, and it's very difficult to give a satisfactory answer.
[03:43:34.586 --> 03:43:48.821]  I mean, the answer that concerns a lot of military people, in fact, I've spoken to quite a few military commanders, and they're concerned because they say the buck always stops with them, but they're not happy about it because they don't understand how they work.
[03:43:49.581 --> 03:43:57.624]  And the other thing about them is, of course, it would be easy to commit a war crime with this kind of robot weapon and then just blow it up afterwards so there's no trace.
[03:43:57.764 --> 03:44:01.445]  I mean, you know, you can't hold a robot accountable for a war crime.
[03:44:01.785 --> 03:44:04.746]  And it could easily be the software manufacturer.
[03:44:05.146 --> 03:44:06.546]  People can hack into them.
[03:44:06.886 --> 03:44:12.728]  I mean, Honda cars have been hacked into and the brakes applied and the steering wheel turned.
[03:44:13.068 --> 03:44:14.769]  So you can hack into anything.
[03:44:15.049 --> 03:44:18.050]  I mean, I've actually met somebody who flies drones
[03:44:19.411 --> 03:44:27.663]  We're moving into a technological future and I think we're not thinking about it enough.
[03:44:28.103 --> 03:44:29.345]  I don't think you can really stop
[03:44:30.154 --> 03:44:36.041]  You can't really hold back the tide of technology or stifle innovation and stop jobs.
[03:44:36.361 --> 03:44:39.204]  But certainly you really need to be thinking about it a lot more.
[03:44:39.524 --> 03:44:41.407]  There's not really any joined up thinking.
[03:44:41.767 --> 03:44:50.096]  And the US, for a start, should have really a strong committee that are looking at these things constantly and thinking about the near future.
[03:44:50.116 --> 03:44:51.157]  And we're not talking about
[03:44:52.238 --> 03:44:52.758]  50 years away.
[03:44:52.798 --> 03:44:55.240]  We're talking about now, this minute in time.
[03:44:55.600 --> 03:44:56.960]  Like it could happen next year.
[03:44:57.281 --> 03:45:00.662]  When North Dakota are getting these weapons, what will they have next year?
[03:45:01.102 --> 03:45:04.884]  And you have a company in Texas, in fact, called Chaotic Moon.
[03:45:04.964 --> 03:45:06.104]  It's a robot company.
[03:45:06.685 --> 03:45:14.288]  And they have made this little, and people say nowhere else but Texas would you see this, they've made this little autonomous drone, right?
[03:45:14.308 --> 03:45:17.410]  So it's a drone that flies completely on its own without any humans.
[03:45:17.830 --> 03:45:19.971]  And what it does is it hovers over your backyard.
[03:45:20.931 --> 03:45:24.515]  And it's called Cupid, the drone.
[03:45:24.795 --> 03:45:31.842]  And it's called Cupid because it hovers over your background, backyard, and if somebody enters your property, it will say leave immediately.
[03:45:32.163 --> 03:45:34.345]  And if they don't leave, it tasers them.
[03:45:34.485 --> 03:45:41.953]  So it fires a taser dart at them, 50,000 volts, and keeps them there until you arrive back or the authorities arrive back.
[03:45:42.473 --> 03:45:42.794]  Wow!
[03:45:44.934 --> 03:45:45.775]  Yes, that's quite something.
[03:45:46.055 --> 03:45:48.916]  And I can imagine police using those for area denial.
[03:45:48.956 --> 03:45:54.159]  So they'll say, you know, instead of putting up barbed wire or whatever, you say, this area is denied.
[03:45:54.459 --> 03:45:56.420]  And if you enter into it, you're going to get tasered.
[03:45:56.740 --> 03:45:56.961]  Right.
[03:45:57.101 --> 03:45:59.662]  And of course, they won't use those at the border.
[03:46:00.803 --> 03:46:09.447]  But I actually, I remember when they were displaying that during South by Southwest a year or so ago, they said that they had a lot of interest from law enforcement.
[03:46:09.587 --> 03:46:11.468]  And they were like, this is just a prototype.
[03:46:11.488 --> 03:46:12.769]  We just did this to show people how
[03:46:13.369 --> 03:46:20.653]  You know, dangerous it is that we're just advancing with this technology and there aren't any rules saying, no, you can't attach a taser to a drone.
[03:46:22.774 --> 03:46:27.056]  Well, now let's talk a little bit about, you know, we're moving forward with this.
[03:46:27.376 --> 03:46:29.057]  Can we stop a negative outcome?
[03:46:30.526 --> 03:46:32.187]  Yes, I mean, we can have new laws.
[03:46:33.047 --> 03:46:48.236]  One thing, the pressure we're putting on the UN with this CCW Committee, it's strange, but if we succeed in getting a prohibitive ban, an international treaty, it will only apply to international armed conflict.
[03:46:48.456 --> 03:46:50.537]  It will not apply to domestic use.
[03:46:51.577 --> 03:46:54.319]  So, for instance, tear gas is not allowed at all.
[03:46:54.379 --> 03:46:56.340]  It's totally prohibited in war.
[03:46:56.360 --> 03:46:59.842]  So you can't use it in conflicts, but the police can use it.
[03:47:00.522 --> 03:47:05.865]  And so getting this prohibition will not stop your police or anybody's police from using it.
[03:47:06.445 --> 03:47:14.689]  But what you can do is, there's another committee that we're pushing for, we're really working hard to get them to pay attention, and that's called the Human Rights Council.
[03:47:14.709 --> 03:47:21.272]  Now the Human Rights Council, they set up our human rights, basic human rights for the entire planet.
[03:47:21.972 --> 03:47:32.238]  And if we can get them to say, you must not arm these drones and these autonomous weapons, police mustn't use them, then they won't be used.
[03:47:33.199 --> 03:47:38.242]  I mean, they might be used, but they'll be in violation of the Human Rights Council, and nobody wants that, really.
[03:47:38.762 --> 03:47:44.646]  Now, are you talking about the same Human Rights Council that has just chosen Saudi Arabia to be one of the leaders?
[03:47:46.144 --> 03:47:46.945]  Yes, I'm afraid so.
[03:47:47.245 --> 03:47:52.152]  But the thing about the Human Rights Council is, I mean, you don't always get the best choices.
[03:47:52.672 --> 03:47:56.757]  But the good thing about it is, it's not dominated by Western countries.
[03:47:56.958 --> 03:47:57.799]  It rotates.
[03:47:58.700 --> 03:48:00.903]  So the members rotate all the time.
[03:48:01.323 --> 03:48:02.324]  And that's a good thing.
[03:48:02.404 --> 03:48:06.646]  So, you know, sometimes you can draw a bad hand, sometimes you can draw a good hand.
[03:48:07.046 --> 03:48:15.310]  But if you look at the Security Council, then you've got Russia, China, United States, the UK and France dominating it.
[03:48:15.770 --> 03:48:18.212]  All five of those countries have a right to veto.
[03:48:18.572 --> 03:48:26.236]  So no matter what votes are taken, even if the vast majority say, yes, we mustn't do this or we mustn't go and fight this war,
[03:48:26.876 --> 03:48:28.237]  Those countries can veto it.
[03:48:28.517 --> 03:48:32.600]  But with the Human Rights Council, they can't veto anything.
[03:48:32.820 --> 03:48:35.401]  So it's a fairer group of people.
[03:48:36.822 --> 03:48:39.244]  You can't always guarantee.
[03:48:39.504 --> 03:48:45.768]  The thing about if you have a United Nations, you have to go with the fact that you have to include all nations.
[03:48:46.468 --> 03:48:47.609]  And you have to put up with it.
[03:48:48.069 --> 03:48:49.490]  And the only reason why you get
[03:48:50.333 --> 03:48:52.634]  Why it works is because there's so many people.
[03:48:52.914 --> 03:48:57.817]  You've got such a diversity of opinion that, you know, you hope that the good washes out of it.
[03:48:58.357 --> 03:49:05.121]  But I have to say my experience of the United Nations over the last three years is that the United States is really the dominant force there.
[03:49:06.301 --> 03:49:07.582]  They're the world superpower.
[03:49:07.622 --> 03:49:08.923]  It's quite clear when you go there.
[03:49:09.465 --> 03:49:13.987]  Right, and I guess that's why it's obvious why this is such an important thing.
[03:49:14.688 --> 03:49:23.012]  Rand Paul famously filibustered just several years ago pointing out the fact that we don't have any laws on the books dealing with how the U.S.
[03:49:23.052 --> 03:49:25.033]  can target Americans on U.S.
[03:49:25.093 --> 03:49:26.753]  soil with these drones.
[03:49:28.594 --> 03:49:29.455]  There's nothing set up.
[03:49:32.642 --> 03:49:34.983]  I mean I think there would be a lot of complaint if you did.
[03:49:35.563 --> 03:49:55.451]  But there was a very close case, if you remember there was that, I can't remember his name, it was about a year ago, two years ago, that guy who had been a law enforcement officer and he was a homicidal maniac and he had escaped and he'd gone to this shack and they sent out a drone and they would have killed him with the drone but instead they set fire to the shack and killed him that way.
[03:49:56.175 --> 03:50:00.456]  Right, yeah, that was a huge conspiracy here and a lot of things going on with that.
[03:50:01.157 --> 03:50:08.259]  Well, Noel Sharkey, thank you so much, AI expert, and I think this is going to be a huge issue in the days coming forward.
[03:50:08.299 --> 03:50:20.403]  I know Matt Drudge, that was one of the topics he kept pointing out over and over again while he was here, is to just keep our eyes on this technology, how it's going to be augmenting our reality as well as our culture.
[03:50:21.903 --> 03:50:25.391]  Obviously, autonomous weapons is a huge deal.
[03:50:25.511 --> 03:50:27.255]  Who's going to be in control of these things?
[03:50:28.057 --> 03:50:29.359]  Well, thank you so much for your time.
[03:50:29.379 --> 03:50:30.221]  Thank you, Leanne.
[03:50:30.402 --> 03:50:31.684]  A pleasure to be on the program.
[03:50:31.825 --> 03:50:32.205]  Thank you.
[03:50:32.526 --> 03:50:32.707]  Bye.
[03:50:34.332 --> 03:50:35.433]  Well, there you have it.
[03:50:36.073 --> 03:50:44.378]  As you mentioned, we've got the UN Human Rights Council in control of how these autonomous weapons are going to be deployed.
[03:50:44.718 --> 03:50:55.224]  That is the same Human Rights Council that now has Saudi Arabia, who crucifies anyone who dare protest the way that their country is being run.
[03:50:55.665 --> 03:51:00.007]  Crucifixion meaning being beheaded and then displayed there in the public square.
[03:51:00.648 --> 03:51:02.849]  And these are the type of extremists
[03:51:03.449 --> 03:51:06.690]  At the UN Global Police Force is going to be looking out for too.
[03:51:06.890 --> 03:51:07.470]  Coming right up.
[03:51:07.610 --> 03:51:15.472]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:16.732 --> 03:51:18.673]  Hey neighbor, what are you doing digging?
[03:51:18.813 --> 03:51:20.493]  You had a heart attack last year.
[03:51:20.513 --> 03:51:21.754]  Oh, I know.
[03:51:22.014 --> 03:51:23.334]  I was told no more hard labor.
[03:51:23.934 --> 03:51:25.034]  Then why are you digging?
[03:51:25.515 --> 03:51:26.835]  Well, I've been taking ExtendoVite.
[03:51:27.355 --> 03:51:28.595]  It's been approved to help my heart.
[03:51:29.115 --> 03:51:29.976]  ExtendoVite?
[03:51:30.156 --> 03:51:31.036]  Is that a new drug?
[03:51:31.894 --> 03:51:32.654]  No, not a drug.
[03:51:33.254 --> 03:51:36.575]  It's more like an herbal combination made from garlic and cayenne.
[03:51:37.075 --> 03:51:37.556]  Herbal?
[03:51:37.716 --> 03:51:38.596]  How can that help?
[03:51:39.216 --> 03:51:41.177]  Well, actually, we've taken herbs for thousands of years.
[03:51:41.717 --> 03:51:43.317]  Extendivite is doing the job for me.
[03:51:43.797 --> 03:51:45.878]  Does your doctor know about Extendivite?
[03:51:46.418 --> 03:51:49.999]  Yeah, my doctor knows, and he said it seems to be working for you, so don't stop taking it.
[03:51:50.299 --> 03:51:51.741]  I feel great taking Xtendivite.
[03:51:52.061 --> 03:51:52.822]  I don't want to stop.
[03:51:53.223 --> 03:51:54.445]  To order, call 1-877-928-8822.

[03:54:23.775 --> 03:54:25.856]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:25.876 --> 03:54:28.317]  You are listening to the 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:54:28.357 --> 03:54:34.421]  We just had a great interview there with AI expert Noel Sharkey, warning about the risk of robotic warfare.
[03:54:34.541 --> 03:54:36.062]  It's edging ever closer.
[03:54:36.102 --> 03:54:45.086]  We definitely need to keep our eye on that, as well as keeping our eye on all these terrifying tech giants who are now dabbling in these autonomous weapons.
[03:54:45.527 --> 03:54:47.588]  Joining me now, Jakari Jackson.
[03:54:47.808 --> 03:54:48.808]  Jakari, how are you?
[03:54:48.828 --> 03:54:49.629]  What do we got coming up?
[03:54:50.302 --> 03:54:53.945]  Well, tonight on the Nightly News we have a pretty jam-packed show.
[03:54:53.985 --> 03:54:58.970]  Of course, we're going to be referencing some of the things that happened yesterday on the Alex Jones Show when Matt Drudge popped in.
[03:54:59.370 --> 03:55:04.254]  Also, we'll be talking about the shooting at UCC Oregon and particularly how the town is reacting to this.
[03:55:04.815 --> 03:55:11.361]  Even one guy who's still in the hospital right now, that's just my understanding, saying, hey Obama, don't come here and grandstand and try to push your agenda.
[03:55:11.841 --> 03:55:15.845]  Let us bury our bodies, let us heal in the hospitals, heal our communities.
[03:55:15.885 --> 03:55:17.166]  We don't need you to come in here with your
[03:55:17.446 --> 03:55:17.806]  12 seconds.
[03:55:17.826 --> 03:55:18.186]  12 seconds.
[03:55:47.020 --> 03:55:52.625]  In a meeting, they kicked him out because they said, we don't want this guy to be up here with a gun, or at least one of the councilmen did.
[03:55:52.985 --> 03:55:54.506]  And everybody else, well, he served his country.
[03:55:54.546 --> 03:55:55.607]  He knows how to use a firearm.
[03:55:55.627 --> 03:55:56.408]  Why can't he be in here?
[03:55:56.688 --> 03:55:58.529]  So these things happen all the time.
[03:55:58.569 --> 03:56:00.951]  But this is just another example of that.
[03:56:01.171 --> 03:56:03.773]  Well, these are the type of extremists that the U.N.'
[03:56:03.753 --> 03:56:05.975]  's global Stasi network is going to be coming after.
[03:56:06.035 --> 03:56:08.037]  It's not actual terrorists.
[03:56:08.137 --> 03:56:10.299]  It's people who are terrorists to the state.
[03:56:11.141 --> 03:56:13.044]  So I'm feeling pretty good today.
[03:56:13.084 --> 03:56:14.125]  I took my brain force.
[03:56:14.646 --> 03:56:15.627]  I'm feeling good.
[03:56:15.707 --> 03:56:16.488]  Feeling good.
[03:56:16.708 --> 03:56:19.532]  Well, this is something for everybody else out there.

[03:56:45.354 --> 03:56:47.735]  And this is one of the, of course, one of the pros.
[03:56:47.755 --> 03:56:48.756]  We don't get too many cons.
[03:56:49.336 --> 03:56:52.639]  And it says it works, and I appreciate the people who put it together.

[03:57:04.267 --> 03:57:06.649]  We have another review and it says love it.
[03:57:07.169 --> 03:57:10.792]  Instead, I got it overnight and then, you know, works just like they said it's going to work.
[03:57:10.832 --> 03:57:16.796]  So thank you all the guys who stopped by and give us those great reviews at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:57:16.936 --> 03:57:17.577]  Well, excellent.
[03:57:17.597 --> 03:57:21.460]  So what did you think about Matt Drudge's surprise visit?
[03:57:21.926 --> 03:57:24.787]  Well, you know, I was surprised just like everybody else was.
[03:57:24.807 --> 03:57:31.790]  You know, I saw some people buzzing around and I was doing some other stuff and then I just realized he was here because Alex announced it on the show.
[03:57:31.811 --> 03:57:32.691]  I was like, really?
[03:57:32.791 --> 03:57:35.172]  And then he came in the back and he spoke with us.
[03:57:35.212 --> 03:57:36.933]  You know, he's really a down-to-earth guy.
[03:57:36.973 --> 03:57:38.193]  Just, you know, seemed like a normal guy.
[03:57:38.213 --> 03:57:41.395]  He's very informed, you know, but just, you know, just a normal guy.
[03:57:41.795 --> 03:57:45.100]  Just incredibly down-to-earth, and that's what I really appreciated about it.
[03:57:45.160 --> 03:57:48.464]  I mean, he was very classy, very kind.
[03:57:48.524 --> 03:57:54.072]  He made everyone—he asked for you by name, he asked for Joe Biggs by name, and here I'm thinking, what?!
[03:57:54.592 --> 03:57:55.373]  You're Matt Drudge!
[03:57:55.413 --> 03:57:57.456]  I look at your site every single day!
[03:57:58.417 --> 03:58:03.718]  And, you know, we had a chance to speak to him, you know, after his interview, and I was like, man, you did a great job.
[03:58:04.058 --> 03:58:18.341]  You know, like, I guess he doesn't do a lot of speaking engagements, but, you know, he just came out and he spoke from the heart, and that really resonated with people, you know, because it was, you can just go and listen to those clips like McBreen did for the Hot Topics, you know, it's such a real personality that's coming out of this guy.
[03:58:18.361 --> 03:58:26.063]  He's not just some guy in the suit, he's not just some guy on the internet, that's how people know him, but he's a real person who's really concerned about the issues that he puts on the site.
[03:58:26.483 --> 03:58:37.296]  Right, and that's why I just, you know, he just wanted to come and show his appreciation for the Renaissance man Alex Jones, even though he did not want to be on camera or give an interview, but you know how Alex can be.
[03:58:37.937 --> 03:58:40.400]  All right, well thank you everyone for tuning in.
