[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.631]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:27.164]  Why you don't do your job?
[00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:33.009]  President Obama's questionable sanity is now not just being noticed by mental health professionals.
[00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:36.592]  Some of his behavior seems irrational to me.
[00:00:36.612 --> 00:00:45.899]  It seems beyond that of just a typical narcissistic, arrogant, sort of, I'm a leader of a big country and I feel tyrannical at the moment kind of attitude.
[00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:47.441]  Demonstrating behavior that is
[00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:56.285]  Not only anti-American, but irrational and erratic and perhaps not exactly what we might want to deem sane.
[00:00:56.605 --> 00:01:00.707]  Or political activist and former presidential nominee, Lyndon LaRouche.
[00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:07.630]  If you move this president, Obama, out of office on the basis of his charge that he's insane,
[00:01:08.695 --> 00:01:10.435]  That's under the 25th Amendment Section 4.
[00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:15.696]  He qualifies for expulsion from the presidency on the basis of that.
[00:01:16.177 --> 00:01:18.297]  Or best-selling author and former U.S.
[00:01:18.317 --> 00:01:20.517]  State Department official Steve Pchenik.
[00:01:20.737 --> 00:01:21.158]  Obama.
[00:01:21.418 --> 00:01:37.541]  The minute he talks about his conspiracy theory or silliness or whatever he wants to say, then what happens is it repercusses back to him and it opens up his own narcissistic vulnerability, which is a fancy way of saying, listen, the more you pump yourself up, stupid,
[00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:44.365]  The more you're going to be vulnerable to the American public asking questions of what did you do in Chicago when you were growing up?
[00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:45.826]  While you were married?
[00:01:45.886 --> 00:01:46.987]  Before you were married?
[00:01:47.287 --> 00:01:48.868]  Before you were educated?
[00:01:48.948 --> 00:01:51.169]  What kind of education did you really have?
[00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:58.694]  Let's look at really what you did because the more stupid things you say and you do to the American public, the more vulnerable you become.
[00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:01.876]  And go ask Axelrod, who's not the brightest guy in the world.
[00:02:02.216 --> 00:02:08.240]  And ask your own heads of national intelligence who remain there because they get pensions and they get double pensions.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.263]  These are not the same guys from the 90s and 80s who worked for Bush and Reagan who really sacrificed their lives.
[00:02:14.543 --> 00:02:19.586]  These are guys who earned their pensions, remained there, and really have never been in the outside world.
[00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:23.949]  So I want this president to keep on attacking me and you and the American public
[00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:29.453]  To come out with more and more stupidity, because underneath it all, he's not just a liar.
[00:02:29.553 --> 00:02:30.934]  He knows he's a sociopath.
[00:02:31.014 --> 00:02:33.475]  He knows it from the day he was born he's a sociopath.
[00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:37.718]  You don't get to be President of the United States unless you want to manipulate the even lie.
[00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.400]  But this is not a man who's basically all that bright.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.282]  In the same way Condoleezza was not very bright.
[00:02:43.642 --> 00:02:44.863]  We know Bush Jr.
[00:02:44.923 --> 00:02:45.503]  was stupid.
[00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:48.685]  Clinton was very bright, but he's a bright liar.
[00:02:48.926 --> 00:02:50.707]  This man is not even a bright liar.
[00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:54.870]  But now an entire country has voiced its concern.
[00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:12.562]  John Schindler, a security expert and whistleblower who now writes for the Daily Beast, has claimed that a senior EU official from an undisclosed country also inquired about the impeachment proceedings, saying that the nation believes Obama is not fit for office.
[00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:15.204]  Schindler tweeted out the revelation Monday.
[00:03:15.644 --> 00:03:19.827]  It read, had a senior EU diplomat old friend asked me today,
[00:03:20.527 --> 00:03:21.989]  How does your impeachment work?
[00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.374]  My government believes Obama is quite mentally unwell.
[00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:34.423]  In fact, the submissive, domesticated Obama supporters at this point have to be suffering varying degrees of psychosis.
[00:03:34.844 --> 00:03:39.769]  You would have to be delusional to ignore Obama's shrouded upbringing by communist Muslims.
[00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:59.967]  His former identity as Barry Sotero, an Indonesian foreign exchange student with confidential college records that rose to prominence traversing Marxist-Socialist circles catapulted into the political landscape due to funds provided by shadowy foreign backers and New World Order strategist George Soros.
[00:04:00.447 --> 00:04:04.469]  President Obama has now shown almost all of the cards in his hand.
[00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:06.089]  After decimating the U.S.
[00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:08.910]  military, aiding and abetting the assault of the U.S.
[00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:29.558]  Constitution, increasing our national debt, creating a mandatory health care tax to destroy the middle class, engaging in divide-and-conquer leadership, and overseeing the policies and trade deals that serve as a Trojan horse for an emerging, corporacratic, global government, you would have to be mentally ill to oppose prosperity.
[00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:38.624]  Humanity has an unlimited potential, massively overshadowing the potential of the New World Order beast's technocratic eugenics plan.
[00:04:38.944 --> 00:04:43.947]  Our sovereign individual national identities have to be maintained and developed.
[00:04:44.347 --> 00:04:51.492]  It is only through this method of human innovation that all of our greatest and sanest achievements have been obtained.
[00:04:52.072 --> 00:04:54.314]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:04:55.374 --> 00:04:59.615]  John Bowne deserves a Peabody or something for the reporting he does.
[00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:01.996]  He is just absolutely amazing.
[00:05:03.056 --> 00:05:07.297]  I've got some news so devastating that I can hardly even cover it when we come back.
[00:05:07.437 --> 00:05:07.837]  Seriously.
[00:05:08.178 --> 00:05:13.719]  Indiana Sheriff Brad Rogers made his stance on the Second Amendment clear during a recent interview.
[00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:24.282]  If President Obama today said, I'm creating an executive order that all sheriffs and police chiefs around this nation need to start registering firearms, I will disregard it.
[00:05:24.522 --> 00:05:34.265]  Presidential candidate Jim Webb defended the Second Amendment rights of Americans during the first Democratic debate and he actually called out his fellow politicians on their hypocrisy.
[00:05:34.425 --> 00:05:42.007]  There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:05:42.387 --> 00:05:47.449]  The average American does not have that and deserves the right to be able to protect their family.
[00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.970]  And Webb's point echoes recent comments made by media pioneer Matt Drudge.
[00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.591]  I challenge Hillary.
[00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:55.353]  Take away your Secret Service.
[00:05:55.653 --> 00:05:56.474]  Dismiss them.
[00:05:56.934 --> 00:05:57.475]  I dare you.
[00:05:57.775 --> 00:05:58.716]  Obama, same thing.
[00:05:58.976 --> 00:06:00.738]  Leave the White House unguarded, Obama.
[00:06:00.758 --> 00:06:02.419]  You know what would happen in 30 seconds?
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.941]  Both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth.
[00:06:05.242 --> 00:06:07.263]  Read more now at InfoWars.com

[00:07:16.852 --> 00:07:24.960]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.942]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:07:44.087 --> 00:07:50.949]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:07:51.109 --> 00:07:55.473]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[00:08:08.493 --> 00:08:09.053]  We've got it.
[00:08:09.093 --> 00:08:15.555]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:08:15.635 --> 00:08:17.695]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:19.996 --> 00:08:25.717]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:28.298 --> 00:08:32.899]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the 15th day of October 2015.
[00:08:38.877 --> 00:08:42.219]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we have a very full broadcast today.
[00:08:44.521 --> 00:08:54.607]  But many times when I come in here and go over the news that I'm going to be covering, there is a dizzying feeling because there's so much.
[00:08:55.907 --> 00:09:01.090]  Like what's important news versus what's just sensational and interesting.
[00:09:02.411 --> 00:09:05.113]  And sometimes things are really important, but they're also sensational.
[00:09:08.601 --> 00:09:09.762]  And I've talked a lot about this.
[00:09:10.162 --> 00:09:13.504]  15 years ago, I might have one over-the-top insane story out of 100.
[00:09:13.704 --> 00:09:21.728]  Now I've probably got 75 out of 200 articles that are just so over-the-top, I can't even believe it.
[00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:34.375]  And then, every few months, in the past it was every few years, but now it's every few months, a group of stories come together
[00:09:36.837 --> 00:09:54.205]  And with my knowledge and understanding of governmental systems worldwide, but particularly here in the United States, the tumblers basically click into place, the safe door opens, and you can really see what's inside.
[00:09:57.527 --> 00:10:02.009]  And a group of stories the last two weeks come together in a confluence
[00:10:06.164 --> 00:10:07.645]  That is so important.
[00:10:13.487 --> 00:10:26.833]  I am having trouble feeling even worthy to try to describe to you how absolutely confirming this is.
[00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:33.116]  And it shakes me to my absolute core.
[00:10:39.286 --> 00:11:03.702]  In fact, this news is so important that when I saw it this morning before the show, and it connected into everything else we already know, I almost went to David Knight's office and said, please put on your sports jacket, grab all the news you're researching, you're doing the show.
[00:11:07.697 --> 00:11:21.822]  So that I could get with Paul Watson, or myself and a word processor, and pull all these links together, put this together, write an article, put out an emergency alert, and really make a big deal out of it.
[00:11:21.882 --> 00:11:36.188]  Because if I just come up here at the start of the show, and mention some of these stories, and tell everybody it's really important, and tell everybody please get this information out, it won't go viral.
[00:11:40.077 --> 00:11:46.898]  If I say we've got a big announcement in a couple days and I build it up, which I don't do that, folks.
[00:11:46.918 --> 00:11:52.119]  I always say coming up and I'll just tell you right then what the news is because I just want to get it out.
[00:11:59.701 --> 00:12:08.143]  So what I am here trying to do is make a big deal out of this and really get people who are lost in the haze of all the news, myself included.
[00:12:08.183 --> 00:12:08.863]  I'm not on some
[00:12:10.236 --> 00:12:37.092]  High mountain here that we can really look at the situation we're in and really see that the worst case scenario analyses that we've come up with and many others have now come up with concurrent breakdowns basically is so horrible and it confirms our worst
[00:12:38.772 --> 00:12:42.674]  Our worst, not fears, our worst long-term projections.
[00:12:43.354 --> 00:12:45.956]  Because we're not long-term projecting now, we're in 2015.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.242]  I am not trying to be dramatic here.
[00:12:59.442 --> 00:13:00.283]  This is dramatic.
[00:13:07.126 --> 00:13:08.307]  Richard walked in this morning.
[00:13:11.914 --> 00:13:19.799]  And he said, you know, you've been covering the Safe Cities Initiative and the UN Treaty.
[00:13:22.221 --> 00:13:24.462]  We know it's tied to the TPP on law enforcement.
[00:13:28.465 --> 00:13:30.006]  Here's the headline from a few weeks ago.
[00:13:30.046 --> 00:13:34.469]  Obama administration and UN announced global police force to fight extremism in US.
[00:13:37.071 --> 00:13:41.674]  Now we have this new article out today from UPI that no one is covering.
[00:13:43.942 --> 00:13:46.304]  Justice Department creates domestic terrorism unit.
[00:13:51.227 --> 00:14:11.500]  And then we have their press releases on it and we have an hour and a half video that we're watching and going over with the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL basically running the Justice Department creating their own basically Bolshevik police force
[00:14:12.907 --> 00:14:36.091]  And they say, and they link to the previous Homeland Security reports that we received and leaked years ago, five different ones, saying that the number one terror enemy is patriots, veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, and saying
[00:14:39.028 --> 00:14:48.882]  That they are going to federalize local police and make their main mission persecuting veterans, returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, Christians.
[00:14:52.086 --> 00:14:53.668]  And you see the beginnings of it.
[00:14:54.773 --> 00:15:11.604]  With 15 people charged in Georgia for being at a park with rebel battle flags and American flags, and in the indictment, which is, again, at the state level, but the feds are involved, it says the flags were threatening.
[00:15:16.467 --> 00:15:19.749]  And you add all this together, they are intending
[00:15:24.454 --> 00:15:42.002]  To start a war in the United States with the American people, they will guaranteed stage false flags to be blamed on us, and they will guaranteed try to round up and arrest Americans en masse.
[00:15:42.222 --> 00:15:43.162]  They're moving to do it.
[00:15:44.163 --> 00:15:47.364]  I know in my gut, and I can see all the facts, they intend to do it.
[00:15:47.845 --> 00:15:48.865]  There's no doubt now.
[00:15:49.725 --> 00:15:50.746]  They are insane.
[00:15:50.946 --> 00:15:51.946]  They are going for broke.
[00:15:52.026 --> 00:15:53.187]  They are crazy.
[00:15:55.919 --> 00:15:57.460]  Hitler was crazy going into Russia.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:03.445]  Napoleon was crazy going into areas and places that he couldn't defeat.
[00:16:05.327 --> 00:16:06.808]  This is the nature of power.
[00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:14.074]  And we have megalomaniacs running the show that hate us, the better cleaners.
[00:16:14.555 --> 00:16:18.198]  They hate us because we don't commit crime at any rate that's measurable.
[00:16:18.658 --> 00:16:20.260]  They hate us because we produce so much wealth.
[00:16:21.394 --> 00:16:22.755]  They hate us because we're strong.
[00:16:22.895 --> 00:16:24.037]  They hate us because we're good.
[00:16:24.877 --> 00:16:27.820]  They hate us because they know that we're not criminals like them.
[00:16:30.203 --> 00:16:35.488]  I told you that they were going to start indicting Republican leadership that was patriots.
[00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:38.391]  They have indicted two of Rand Paul's staffers.
[00:16:42.855 --> 00:16:44.837]  They're calling it payments for endorsements.
[00:16:49.505 --> 00:16:55.368]  No, the Campaign for Liberty, other organizations, that's what they do is they give money to libertarian candidates to build a movement.
[00:16:56.588 --> 00:17:04.752]  And the Republican and Democratic parties have circled the wagons against the Tea Party because the Tea Party is taking over the Republican Party.
[00:17:05.852 --> 00:17:06.952]  We've removed the Speaker.
[00:17:09.293 --> 00:17:10.714]  We're trying to get a good Speaker in.
[00:17:10.834 --> 00:17:12.415]  That would be like getting a good President in.
[00:17:12.655 --> 00:17:13.495]  It's just as important.
[00:17:14.176 --> 00:17:15.116]  Just as important.
[00:17:19.397 --> 00:17:23.139]  This is a quiet, peaceful revolution, trying to take our country back the right way.
[00:17:24.239 --> 00:17:29.682]  And I'm telling you right now, Ron Paul's on next week, but they are trying to find anything to indict.
[00:17:30.722 --> 00:17:31.323]  Rand Paul.
[00:17:33.063 --> 00:17:33.724]  Ron Paul.
[00:17:35.945 --> 00:17:36.665]  Governor Abbott.
[00:17:37.445 --> 00:17:39.226]  They've already indicted the Texas Attorney General.
[00:17:40.447 --> 00:17:41.968]  I told you they got the feds on me.
[00:17:43.428 --> 00:17:44.589]  Why do you think Drudge was here?
[00:17:46.001 --> 00:17:49.462]  Judges have been told by Supreme Court Justice and others that it's coming.
[00:17:51.003 --> 00:17:51.623]  They've been told.
[00:17:54.224 --> 00:17:55.725]  This is white knuckle time, folks.
[00:17:58.486 --> 00:18:02.327]  And if they get away with indicting Rand Paul and Ron Paul, I told you they're real.
[00:18:02.647 --> 00:18:03.528]  People want to bash them.
[00:18:03.548 --> 00:18:06.369]  They got fake libertarian whisper campaigns against them all day long.
[00:18:06.689 --> 00:18:07.469]  That's government run.
[00:18:07.749 --> 00:18:08.709]  Just like they have it against me.
[00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:09.650]  Because they know.
[00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:10.890]  They got our phones tapped, folks.
[00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:11.731]  They know our families.
[00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:12.931]  They know we're for real.
[00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:15.132]  They know that we'll go all the way.
[00:18:16.783 --> 00:18:17.764]  We're the real deal, folks.
[00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:19.125]  And they know it.
[00:18:21.047 --> 00:18:25.431]  And they've got... The White House is ordering the FBI to find something.
[00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:27.273]  They've been investigating me for two years.
[00:18:27.393 --> 00:18:28.074]  They can't do it.
[00:18:29.315 --> 00:18:35.521]  The FBI, for all its problems, has a organizational resistance to the total destruction of the country.
[00:18:37.063 --> 00:18:41.387]  And I was told about a year ago they were going to create a Justice Department special unit
[00:18:42.827 --> 00:18:55.810]  That will basically command local police forces and will take control of special units that they're creating within the ATF, the BATF, within the FBI, within the hostage rescue team, all of it.
[00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:02.971]  And this is the equivalent of a Hitlerian brown shirt takeover in America.
[00:19:04.891 --> 00:19:07.752]  And they're making their move with a coup inside the government.
[00:19:08.991 --> 00:19:10.572]  To really take over.
[00:19:10.672 --> 00:19:14.115]  They've got the central banks, they've got the regulators, they've got a lot of that in place.
[00:19:14.636 --> 00:19:23.123]  But now, they are creating the federal police, commissar, political police, NKVD style units.
[00:19:26.085 --> 00:19:29.688]  And believe me, it's not just going to be indictments, it's not just going to be arrests.
[00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.432]  They have obviously large assassination teams.
[00:19:35.359 --> 00:19:38.220]  They have been canvassing the U.S.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:47.785]  military and mercenaries, but there is a boycott within those groups to commit murders against patriots in the United States.
[00:19:48.345 --> 00:19:55.288]  But they are canvassing and trying to line up large shadow government forces
[00:19:57.421 --> 00:20:04.163]  Similar to how the Nazis tried to get Smedley Butler to have a coup, well this isn't Nazis doing it, it's communists and big banks.
[00:20:04.783 --> 00:20:06.124]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:20:06.364 --> 00:20:08.404]  It is unbelievable.
[00:20:08.464 --> 00:20:12.686]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[00:20:12.866 --> 00:20:16.767]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[00:20:16.927 --> 00:20:21.148]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s, and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:29.311]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[00:20:29.531 --> 00:20:38.035]  If you want to boost your Omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[00:24:22.259 --> 00:24:30.294]  Yeah, Strange Days have found us.
[00:24:30.374 --> 00:24:33.459]  They're going to destroy us.
[00:24:51.884 --> 00:24:59.746]  A multinational banking cartel that operates as organized crime has taken over basically about 70% of the planet.
[00:25:01.486 --> 00:25:03.846]  It's got tentacles into Russia, tentacles into China.
[00:25:05.207 --> 00:25:10.368]  China is probably even just as bad or worse a predator group than the Anglo-American establishment.
[00:25:11.688 --> 00:25:21.350]  Russia was captured by the Anglo-American establishment through the Bolshevik disease and is halfway pulled itself away from the entity and so is being
[00:25:23.263 --> 00:25:30.605]  Besieged by economic warfare and destabilization foundations within.
[00:25:32.245 --> 00:25:38.326]  But Russia still is strongman mafia corruption, but it's angelic compared to the eugenicist.
[00:25:39.086 --> 00:25:43.247]  The Russians are not putting fluoride in their water and cancer viruses in their vaccine for their public.
[00:25:46.828 --> 00:25:50.429]  And when they bring down the Russians, there'll be nothing else standing against them.
[00:25:52.924 --> 00:25:53.925]  Except the American people.
[00:25:57.868 --> 00:25:58.969]  And that's why we're under attack.
[00:26:03.053 --> 00:26:06.576]  And the globalist secret weapon is the radical Muslims.
[00:26:06.616 --> 00:26:07.837]  They're going to turn them loose everywhere.
[00:26:09.986 --> 00:26:23.413]  In Germany, we told you about this yesterday, but this is RT, German parents outraged that their school children have to make beds cooked for refugees, retirees are being thrown out of their homes, and the quote immigrants and migrants are being given them.
[00:26:25.214 --> 00:26:30.497]  The Express reports refugees taunt police with selfies showing stolen goods, but they can't be arrested.
[00:26:31.537 --> 00:26:34.279]  They've been told that they are above the law by the French Federal Police.
[00:26:35.916 --> 00:26:37.597]  Now, you think this is over the top.
[00:26:37.777 --> 00:26:39.918]  No, this is meant to break the will.
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:47.723]  You can rape women, you can tell women that they can't, you know, wear short skirts in Germany at Oktoberfest.
[00:26:49.324 --> 00:26:51.265]  But if you protest against it, you'll be arrested.
[00:26:54.587 --> 00:26:56.488]  This is the leftist system of tyranny.
[00:26:57.008 --> 00:27:00.010]  The exact same system you see in Germany is what they're going to have here.
[00:27:03.228 --> 00:27:12.635]  And when they activate the Justice Department units that are already in place, those teams are going to run the false flags in phase one.
[00:27:14.357 --> 00:27:28.728]  To then have a huge media frenzy and hysteria projecting the school, the federal building, the police station, the statehouse that gets hit by a quote, patriot truck bomb.
[00:27:31.334 --> 00:27:44.485]  Except they know we're on our toes, and we're aware of this, and so I said when they start trying to indict Ron Paul, Rand Paul, myself, Matt Drudge, you may not think Rush Limbaugh's a good guy, but they're going to go after him too.
[00:27:47.827 --> 00:27:54.713]  When they make that move, they've already started to indict News Corp, so they went and made a deal, joined the Democrats two years ago.
[00:27:54.993 --> 00:27:56.014]  The indictments got dropped.
[00:27:57.346 --> 00:28:00.348]  The Republican leadership said, look, just give us money, let us go along with you.
[00:28:00.748 --> 00:28:02.609]  They're going to be set up in the end and take it out as well.
[00:28:02.629 --> 00:28:04.030]  They're going to go with a one-party deal here.
[00:28:05.551 --> 00:28:08.232]  They'll still be somewhat of a Republican party, but it's going to be limited.
[00:28:12.615 --> 00:28:13.536]  This is the takeover.
[00:28:13.576 --> 00:28:14.736]  This is America falling.
[00:28:14.776 --> 00:28:15.217]  This is it.
[00:28:16.918 --> 00:28:20.960]  And they will just start arresting people for rebel flags, then Gadsden flags.
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.341]  They'll say someone's feelings were hurt.
[00:28:22.941 --> 00:28:24.682]  Oops, you resisted the police, you got killed.
[00:28:28.851 --> 00:28:31.833]  You know, how dare the Patriots, you know, have blown up that school?
[00:28:33.175 --> 00:28:34.696]  They'll hit some tearjerker target.
[00:28:38.219 --> 00:28:40.681]  And I just don't want to sit here and watch this happen.
[00:28:42.302 --> 00:28:45.124]  I know the military is beside itself knowing about this.
[00:28:46.926 --> 00:28:50.649]  Military's not perfect, but killing America really gets to even the high-level brass.
[00:28:52.296 --> 00:28:56.878]  They know that they've been removing actual military men and they've been putting politicians in.
[00:28:57.378 --> 00:28:59.179]  This has never before been done at this level.
[00:29:00.179 --> 00:29:04.401]  They have culled massive numbers of people.
[00:29:07.022 --> 00:29:08.222]  The purge accelerates.
[00:29:12.544 --> 00:29:13.904]  I'm going to stay here through this.
[00:29:14.505 --> 00:29:15.525]  I'm not going to evacuate.
[00:29:18.547 --> 00:29:20.267]  Because if we give in to them, they're going to win.
[00:29:20.307 --> 00:29:23.148]  There's a very good chance they've bitten off way more than they can chew.
[00:29:23.168 --> 00:29:33.630]  If we get the word out about this plan, and about how they're making a federal, international, domestic force on the ground, running your local cities, bypassing the states.
[00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:38.770]  This is the feds, the globalists, through the feds, taking over the states.
[00:29:40.031 --> 00:29:40.671]  At the city level.
[00:29:41.591 --> 00:29:47.572]  With their politically correct, community organizing, UN, federal forces.
[00:29:49.688 --> 00:29:55.872]  And they, I mean, they say, they say in this hour and a half video that their enemy is the Patriots, the Tea Party, and they're coming for us.
[00:29:56.152 --> 00:29:56.612]  They're coming.
[00:29:57.473 --> 00:29:58.373]  We're on the march.
[00:29:58.854 --> 00:30:00.475]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.395 --> 00:30:04.097]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:08.103 --> 00:30:20.609]  The Obama administration is spending $75 million a year arming special agents with the Environmental Protection Agency with drones, night vision goggles, camouflage, guns, and assault ships.
[00:30:20.869 --> 00:30:24.370]  The EPA is equipping its own army to take out U.S.
[00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:24.971]  polluters.
[00:30:25.311 --> 00:30:29.713]  Watchdog Group opened the books, examined thousands of checks totaling more than $93 billion from 2000 to 2014.
[00:30:32.594 --> 00:30:39.656]  And they found that $75 million is authorized each year for criminal enforcement of America's clean air and water laws.
[00:30:39.876 --> 00:30:43.177]  Some of these weapons are for full-scale military operations.
[00:30:43.417 --> 00:30:51.160]  Two years ago, the EPA was involved in an armed raid at a small town in Alaska where miners were accused of polluting local waters.
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:31:04.980]  It's incredibly ironic considering that it was the Environmental Protection Agency who was recently guilty of dumping millions of pounds of toxic wastewater into the Animas River in Colorado, causing untold damage to the environment for years to come.

[00:31:07.964 --> 00:31:13.406]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.

[00:32:11.257 --> 00:32:16.342]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[00:32:16.482 --> 00:32:19.283]  And optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:32:19.483 --> 00:32:24.506]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:32:41.024 --> 00:32:45.767]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:32:46.007 --> 00:32:49.169]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:32:49.309 --> 00:32:52.512]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:32:52.792 --> 00:32:54.593]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:32:54.773 --> 00:32:56.634]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:32:56.874 --> 00:32:58.755]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:32:58.876 --> 00:33:04.459]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:38.254]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:34:08.456 --> 00:34:11.087]  We have Joe Biggs on the line via Skype.
[00:34:12.981 --> 00:34:38.357]  I don't know how much he wants to identify how successful he's been today, but he is there at the Hillary event in San Antonio with the folks, Mr. Castro, who it appears is going to be her VP, pushing the race division agenda that's part of breaking this country, that if you don't let unlimited people come here and pay for everything for free, you're racist.
[00:34:39.582 --> 00:34:47.886]  And then they create victimology in the people that, you only had the babies for free and the welfare, and the bad people don't want to give you more because they hate you.
[00:34:51.207 --> 00:34:54.249]  It's just, again, total abomination, divide and conquer.
[00:34:55.229 --> 00:35:00.151]  And he's down there, a lot of folks have shown up down there, a lot of Infowarriors down in San Antonio.
[00:35:00.171 --> 00:35:01.392]  We're going to be talking to him in a moment.
[00:35:02.773 --> 00:35:05.514]  I'm going to write an article with Watson either today or tomorrow.
[00:35:05.574 --> 00:35:07.675]  It'll either be out this afternoon or it'll be out in the morning.
[00:35:09.406 --> 00:35:23.674]  Breaking down the history of what I was just getting into, but there's thousands of points that go into this, but when they start, as I've said hundreds of times, indicting Ron Paul, Rand Paul, and believe me, that's what this is building up to.
[00:35:24.094 --> 00:35:26.876]  Ron Paul has said it's political to take his son out of the race.
[00:35:27.416 --> 00:35:29.157]  He was the frontrunner just three months ago.
[00:35:30.878 --> 00:35:37.082]  I've supported Rand Paul, even though I've said he hadn't been hardcore enough, because I know he's for real.
[00:35:38.171 --> 00:35:39.272]  And I know his father's for real.
[00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:42.333]  I know them both well.
[00:35:43.554 --> 00:35:44.254]  And I'll leave it at that.
[00:35:48.776 --> 00:35:50.877]  And they're going to probably go after Walter Jones.
[00:35:50.897 --> 00:35:56.320]  They're going to probably go after people like Webster in Congress.
[00:35:57.501 --> 00:36:03.784]  They're going to go after the very serious men who are dedicated to the principles of this country and are trying to save it.
[00:36:04.687 --> 00:36:09.730]  And they're like surgeons in an emergency situation with a shot up victim with 20 gunshot wounds.
[00:36:12.712 --> 00:36:15.193]  And the globalists are trying to pull them off, the patient.
[00:36:17.295 --> 00:36:29.342]  And the fact that they would indict, and that's how it begins, two of Rand Paul and Ron Paul's former staffers, is the preparation.
[00:36:31.616 --> 00:36:49.589]  To try to shut down Campaign for Liberty that is at the heart of creating and pushing a libertarian constitutional movement in Congress that you see has now removed the Speaker and has the votes to block a neocon at this point.
[00:36:50.149 --> 00:36:52.831]  And so they're letting the polls know right now.
[00:36:54.412 --> 00:36:55.613]  And they're letting everybody else know.
[00:36:56.653 --> 00:36:59.696]  You back down, you bow down, you go along with us.
[00:37:00.942 --> 00:37:02.163]  Or we're gonna arrest you.
[00:37:03.884 --> 00:37:05.886]  You wonder why Congress won't stand up to the tyranny?
[00:37:06.386 --> 00:37:07.527]  It's because they're blackmailed.
[00:37:08.788 --> 00:37:11.810]  And the polls are as clean as it gets.
[00:37:13.412 --> 00:37:15.513]  It doesn't matter, they can indict a ham sandwich.
[00:37:19.616 --> 00:37:24.120]  And you need to understand, this signifies they're going to come after the guns.
[00:37:25.021 --> 00:37:26.802]  They're going to say your kids belong to them.
[00:37:27.002 --> 00:37:28.603]  They're coming with forced inoculations.
[00:37:28.844 --> 00:37:30.445]  They're coming to make you eat GMO.
[00:37:31.937 --> 00:37:35.639]  They're putting us under international treaties and won't even let us see them.
[00:37:35.899 --> 00:37:41.381]  And when we get pieces of it, it's so draconian, I can't even believe it.
[00:37:42.842 --> 00:37:44.703]  So, here's the newsflash.
[00:37:45.323 --> 00:37:48.044]  We're already in a semi-captured, occupied country.
[00:37:48.704 --> 00:37:50.705]  But they know they don't run the states completely.
[00:37:51.105 --> 00:37:52.386]  They don't run the cities completely.
[00:37:52.426 --> 00:37:54.067]  They don't run the police departments completely.
[00:37:55.407 --> 00:37:56.768]  They don't run the military completely.
[00:37:58.186 --> 00:38:04.491]  So they're demoralizing it, saying we're going to put women in frontline combat in trannies and make army soldiers wear red high heels in public.
[00:38:06.833 --> 00:38:08.334]  And we're going to make the U.S.
[00:38:08.394 --> 00:38:12.238]  Army serve ISIS and Al Qaeda to make all the patriots leave.
[00:38:17.062 --> 00:38:21.385]  And they've come in for 15 years and only hired police officers in major cities with under 100 IQs.
[00:38:25.009 --> 00:38:26.470]  They've tried to put idiots in there.
[00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:27.811]  It still hasn't worked.
[00:38:28.491 --> 00:38:35.415]  So they show the bad ones to project them onto all the police, to bully them and intimidate them in a national terror campaign.
[00:38:36.175 --> 00:38:38.717]  Run out of the White House that's killed hundreds of police.
[00:38:42.459 --> 00:38:54.686]  To then make them submit and take all the community organizing, political correctness training as the actual UN in every major city above 100,000 now has offices of up to three people.
[00:38:56.636 --> 00:39:03.718]  I have like eight of them in the Austin government I know of that liaison and work for the United Nations.
[00:39:03.838 --> 00:39:06.578]  And now they have InfraGard badges.
[00:39:07.379 --> 00:39:08.859]  That's FBI level badges.
[00:39:11.279 --> 00:39:14.640]  The Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, have these badges.
[00:39:16.261 --> 00:39:18.261]  They're basically foreign intelligence operatives.
[00:39:19.001 --> 00:39:20.702]  Well, there's no basically about it with the ADL.
[00:39:22.162 --> 00:39:23.482]  And we have been infiltrated.
[00:39:24.263 --> 00:39:25.803]  We have been completely taken over.
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:29.301]  And now they're getting ready to really come after the American people.
[00:39:29.521 --> 00:39:32.622]  I mean, I just cannot believe they're really doing it.
[00:39:33.943 --> 00:39:35.424]  They are so bad, folks.
[00:39:35.464 --> 00:39:36.664]  They are so bloodthirsty.
[00:39:36.704 --> 00:39:37.905]  They are so hateful.
[00:39:39.045 --> 00:39:40.546]  They hate us because we're good.
[00:39:41.486 --> 00:39:43.007]  They hate us because we're not corrupt.
[00:39:43.927 --> 00:39:45.328]  They want to destroy this country.
[00:39:46.048 --> 00:39:47.809]  Look what they've done with Hollywood and the culture.
[00:39:48.689 --> 00:39:50.030]  Look at how sick America is.
[00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:51.850]  Look what they've done to us.
[00:39:53.811 --> 00:39:55.192]  And if we just wake up to it,
[00:39:56.971 --> 00:39:58.051]  Which we're starting to do.
[00:39:58.771 --> 00:40:00.112]  We could get the poison out of us.
[00:40:00.152 --> 00:40:01.492]  We could vomit out the poison.
[00:40:02.152 --> 00:40:03.653]  We could convalesce.
[00:40:03.693 --> 00:40:04.413]  We could get better.
[00:40:05.713 --> 00:40:13.495]  But everybody in government especially, and I know there's good people there, people in government are awake because they're either for it or they're against it.
[00:40:13.895 --> 00:40:16.716]  It's so bad now, people realize this is really happening.
[00:40:17.476 --> 00:40:20.196]  In the military, in the FBI, in the federal marshals.
[00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:22.977]  There's a lot of bad ones at the top.
[00:40:23.257 --> 00:40:24.277]  There are a lot of good men and women.
[00:40:25.138 --> 00:40:26.478]  And they now know this is real.
[00:40:28.331 --> 00:40:29.752]  And people are really freaked out.
[00:40:32.996 --> 00:40:35.778]  Right down to sergeant level, they're asking, will you fire on Americans?
[00:40:35.798 --> 00:40:36.619]  Will you take guns?
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.201]  It's in the army times.
[00:40:39.702 --> 00:40:46.829]  They've had countless generals, you know, be quoted in the Washington Post about, yeah, we'll use foreign troops for civil unrest in America and gun confiscation.
[00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:49.392]  That's in my film, Masters of Terror.
[00:40:50.513 --> 00:40:52.675]  Washington Post article saying that.
[00:40:55.469 --> 00:40:58.210]  But they've got to normalize it like it's no big deal.
[00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:01.230]  We're going to Joe Biggs in one minute.
[00:41:03.891 --> 00:41:07.532]  They've got to just act like it's, yeah, we arrest you for the rebel flag now.
[00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:08.812]  Ten years in prison.
[00:41:09.292 --> 00:41:11.513]  Yeah, your kids belong to us, we're going to forcibly inoculate them.
[00:41:11.853 --> 00:41:19.455]  Oh yeah, the borders are open and you're going to pay for everybody and the Border Patrol is going to ship the illegals in and give them vouchers.
[00:41:20.895 --> 00:41:25.156]  And then pay $7,000 a month per groups of three to house them.
[00:41:30.549 --> 00:41:35.257]  And you wonder why suddenly you see demonstrations all over the country with people with communist flags by the hundreds.
[00:41:35.978 --> 00:41:38.863]  I've been in Austin twice and heard chanting downtown.
[00:41:39.184 --> 00:41:40.306]  It must be going on all the time.
[00:41:40.887 --> 00:41:44.493]  And there'll be 200 communists marching with signs saying kill police.
[00:41:48.865 --> 00:41:49.746]  They're warming up.
[00:41:49.846 --> 00:41:50.627]  They're getting ready.
[00:41:50.667 --> 00:41:51.828]  They're coming out of the shadows.
[00:41:52.068 --> 00:41:53.129]  This is it, people!
[00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:54.991]  This is the takedown!
[00:41:55.151 --> 00:41:57.233]  The destruction of the United States of America!
[00:41:57.753 --> 00:41:58.634]  Founded in 1776!
[00:41:58.914 --> 00:42:01.957]  This is traitors cutting us up in pieces!
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.221]  And I'm not scared for me.
[00:42:10.204 --> 00:42:11.686]  I am in mourning.
[00:42:14.226 --> 00:42:30.192]  When I look at the weird, chip-on-their-shoulder, mentally ill people, when I look at the head of the Justice Department, when I look at Obama, when I look at those Democratic members of Congress, and the intimidated Republicans are all scared, they are a crazed pack of organized thugs.
[00:42:30.252 --> 00:42:31.212]  They are a mafia.
[00:42:31.852 --> 00:42:32.673]  They are killers.
[00:42:32.753 --> 00:42:34.413]  They are trash.
[00:42:35.294 --> 00:42:39.595]  They would bring in Obamacare, doubling and tripling prices on their own idiot constituents.
[00:42:40.375 --> 00:42:41.756]  They are so ruthless.
[00:42:43.985 --> 00:42:45.506]  But also they're so weak.
[00:42:46.586 --> 00:42:49.487]  But our denial has allowed them to take over.
[00:42:51.648 --> 00:42:53.089]  Joe Biggs is down there.
[00:42:53.769 --> 00:42:59.251]  He was wearing his Hillary for prison shirt, but I'm told there's been some new developments down in San Antonio.
[00:42:59.271 --> 00:43:01.212]  The map's on Infowars.com where he's at.
[00:43:01.552 --> 00:43:02.933]  Hillary's going to be there for another two hours.
[00:43:03.373 --> 00:43:04.654]  She's speaking at two different events.
[00:43:06.434 --> 00:43:12.237]  Basically promoting a Latin American invasion that's being branded and sold as a race-based consciousness.
[00:43:14.209 --> 00:43:32.579]  With the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation, it's not that Hispanics are bad, it's that the government, the Ford Foundation, is basically creating a victimology, you're a victim, stirring it up, some of it's true, you know, 10%, 90% is bull, and then just trying to do what they've done with blacks.
[00:43:32.659 --> 00:43:36.902]  And if you see how they've totally destroyed the black community and created victimology and dependency,
[00:43:38.242 --> 00:43:39.964]  They're trying to do it with Hispanics.
[00:43:40.124 --> 00:43:43.707]  And it's not been really that successful, actually.
[00:43:43.887 --> 00:43:47.430]  Almost 70% of Hispanics, including illegals who are polled, don't want open borders.
[00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:48.991]  They're not idiots.
[00:43:49.611 --> 00:43:50.672]  I mean, they know what they just left.
[00:43:50.692 --> 00:43:51.733]  They don't want that coming here.
[00:43:52.834 --> 00:43:53.935]  They understand it's massive.
[00:43:55.390 --> 00:44:06.492]  And it's being coordinated by the Globalist, and so she's down there invoking race, and saying you poor victims, you poor things, and beating her evil drum, and Joe Biggs is there reporting.
[00:44:06.532 --> 00:44:10.233]  Joe, tell me what you're witnessing with Hillary and what's happened so far.
[00:44:10.253 --> 00:44:12.374]  I know you've had some success there.
[00:44:12.514 --> 00:44:13.014]  Joe Biggs.
[00:44:14.314 --> 00:44:14.914]  Roger that.
[00:44:14.954 --> 00:44:18.495]  Joe, actually I'm having audio in my ear.
[00:44:19.517 --> 00:44:20.137]  Need to fix that.
[00:44:20.638 --> 00:44:25.980]  I'm standing outside of the historic Sunset Station in San Antonio.
[00:44:26.761 --> 00:44:43.289]  So far we have been able to basically weasel our way into the Hillary Clinton event and right now as you can see I have on my Hillary t-shirt and I'm standing in front of this Stalin-like photo of Hillary Clinton.
[00:44:44.269 --> 00:44:45.210]  It's very eerie.
[00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:45.810]  I'm
[00:44:47.099 --> 00:44:49.081]  Literally deep in the lion's den right now.
[00:44:49.741 --> 00:44:52.583]  So I've got my Hillary for Prison t-shirt on under here.
[00:44:52.964 --> 00:45:00.990]  I'm going to release that later once she comes out and speaks and scream Hillary for Prison and take this shirt off and then start screaming Hillary for Prison.
[00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.690]  We'll see what happens.
[00:45:03.231 --> 00:45:04.833]  Well Joe, it's key you do this.
[00:45:04.953 --> 00:45:07.715]  We have to get on the offensive everywhere Obama goes.
[00:45:07.755 --> 00:45:11.138]  You were there with Jakari last week and the rest of the crew.
[00:45:12.481 --> 00:45:25.812]  Matt and Josh and he had to hide out behind the college and they just shot it with a camera handheld without a lapel mic horrible audio and you could tell he was like a cornered cornered rat and
[00:45:28.078 --> 00:45:29.941]  It just shows we have to get on the offensive.
[00:45:29.981 --> 00:45:42.100]  You just heard me break down that they are going to federalize all local departments under the UN and they now put out a hour and a half video report we're going to be playing parts of later where they admit it's all Southern Poverty Law Center run.
[00:45:42.950 --> 00:46:04.235]  with local spies and they will be arresting people for their political views uh... and they're and they're announcing that the patriots are gonna be blowing everything up and the big war is about to be with the Tea Party that will start carrying out terror of course the Tea Party doesn't do that they're going to start blowing stuff up and saying we did it uh... we've caught them before in Oklahoma City so it's now completely clear what they're doing it is
[00:46:05.282 --> 00:46:14.551]  Over the top, it's the standard deal where they do five minutes on fallen troops to terrorists overseas, then they shift into domestic groups, the Tea Party, the gun owners, the veterans.
[00:46:15.432 --> 00:46:29.225]  So they're going operational with this now, and it really shows with the moving to, well they've indicted two of Rand Paul's and Ron Paul's staffers, and that of course is to try to get them to flip on the Pauls.
[00:46:30.126 --> 00:46:34.869]  Obviously, Drudge was here last week to say they're coming after us, and in private he told me even more.
[00:46:35.929 --> 00:46:37.350]  Drudge is at the highest levels.
[00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:39.471]  He talks to you name it.
[00:46:40.131 --> 00:46:42.012]  Not just Supreme Court justices, I'll leave it at that.
[00:46:42.933 --> 00:46:46.615]  And the Republicans have been told, you submit or we're going to arrest you.
[00:46:47.415 --> 00:46:50.757]  And we are going to take the free speech, and we are going to put the Tea Party in prison.
[00:46:51.556 --> 00:46:53.076]  So, I mean, it's on.
[00:46:53.537 --> 00:46:54.937]  And that doesn't intimidate me.
[00:46:55.397 --> 00:46:57.498]  I can't believe we're going to let this happen.
[00:46:57.518 --> 00:47:02.259]  We've got to get in their face, call them out as criminals, and really show what they've done.
[00:47:02.279 --> 00:47:07.060]  And a lot of foreign leaders are saying Obama's mentally ill.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.981]  You look at the Attorney General, she looks like a crazy lady with a chip on her shoulder.
[00:47:11.205 --> 00:47:18.866]  I mean, this is a bunch of crazy community communist organizers and big banks who really think they're going to be able to take down the United States.
[00:47:19.487 --> 00:47:21.187]  They're trying to take down Russia right now?
[00:47:21.207 --> 00:47:21.967]  I mean, they're crazy!
[00:47:22.707 --> 00:47:25.928]  They think we're so dumb they fund Al-Qaeda publicly?
[00:47:25.948 --> 00:47:28.348]  I mean, I know the military's waking up.
[00:47:28.388 --> 00:47:29.288]  You talk about it, Joe.
[00:47:30.428 --> 00:47:31.929]  Give me your take on what we were just breaking down.
[00:47:31.949 --> 00:47:38.930]  I mean, one of the interesting things is, though, a lot of people that come here, they come here for the fact that they're quote-unquote feminists.
[00:47:39.688 --> 00:47:41.569]  And they come out here and they're like, Hillary's for women.
[00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:48.191]  Well first of all, Hillary Clinton covered for her husband who was doing stuff, so that kind of goes against feminism.
[00:47:48.852 --> 00:47:50.012]  Herself cheats as well.
[00:47:50.352 --> 00:48:04.078]  And then she also takes money, the Clinton Foundation takes money from Arab nations that literally degrade women, don't let them show their selves, have to cover up their entire bodies, are not equal to men, can't get jobs, can't do anything.
[00:48:04.498 --> 00:48:11.927]  And yet these women that come out here and scream that Hillary for women are just completely and totally demented, delusional, mentally ill, however you want to put it.
[00:48:12.267 --> 00:48:16.893]  And then you have a whole large crowd over here to my left because we're inside, like I said, the lion's den.
[00:48:16.933 --> 00:48:18.615]  I'm in Hillary Clinton territory right now.
[00:48:19.135 --> 00:48:24.081]  There's hundreds of people here ready to find out what kind of free stuff they are going to get for voting for her.
[00:48:24.713 --> 00:48:31.115]  Not one of them even cares about the American men and women who have gone overseas to fight for this country.
[00:48:31.455 --> 00:48:35.476]  They don't care about them getting the healthcare that they deserve, the education, anything like that.
[00:48:35.536 --> 00:48:35.976]  No, no, no.
[00:48:36.256 --> 00:48:41.657]  Everybody wants to come on into America, open the borders, and get their free ride to whatever else there is out there.
[00:48:42.057 --> 00:48:46.278]  So we're going to sit here and talk to people and find out why they like her.
[00:48:47.078 --> 00:48:48.439]  Well, it's identity politics.
[00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:51.440]  They don't care if Clinton settled cases with women he raped.
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:52.740]  They don't care
[00:48:54.284 --> 00:49:01.688]  Uh, if Hillary is involved in all sorts of evil corruption and Fast and Furious, they like to feel powerful through her.
[00:49:03.069 --> 00:49:06.071]  It's like a five year old boy imagining he's Batman or Superman.
[00:49:06.871 --> 00:49:08.372]  They are, they are posers.
[00:49:09.313 --> 00:49:11.354]  And so that's who they are.
[00:49:11.854 --> 00:49:14.916]  And also when you talk to them, they are incredibly stupid.
[00:49:15.817 --> 00:49:17.638]  They are, they are sheep oriented.
[00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:20.870]  And they are just pathetic.
[00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:21.611]  I mean, they're just idiots.
[00:49:22.351 --> 00:49:28.475]  Hillary wants to allow families of victims who die in mass shootings to be able to sue gun manufacturers.
[00:49:28.495 --> 00:49:30.717]  I mean, that is the most ridiculous thing in the world.
[00:49:30.937 --> 00:49:32.758]  And they're already setting up presidents right now.
[00:49:32.778 --> 00:49:35.600]  A lawsuit just happened in Wisconsin.
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:46.567]  I think it was yesterday, an article came out in a Chicago newspaper, NRT as well, where two police officers were shot by someone who had basically got a gun through a straw purchase.
[00:49:46.992 --> 00:49:50.597]  And $6 million has been awarded to the two shooting victims.
[00:49:51.017 --> 00:49:53.981]  And they're getting that from the store.
[00:49:54.321 --> 00:49:54.942]  So, you know...
[00:49:55.842 --> 00:49:58.723]  Here they are, they're gonna push this whole thing, we're gonna go after straw purchases.
[00:49:58.983 --> 00:50:00.863]  But meanwhile, like you said, we had Fast and Furious.
[00:50:00.903 --> 00:50:01.384]  What was that?
[00:50:01.784 --> 00:50:04.805]  They allowed these straw purchases to happen, they allowed these guns to go around.
[00:50:04.885 --> 00:50:05.325]  What happened?
[00:50:05.705 --> 00:50:08.706]  We lost an American Border Patrol agent from that.
[00:50:09.026 --> 00:50:10.246]  So they flip-flop on everything.
[00:50:10.286 --> 00:50:12.027]  They say they're against this, but then they're really for it.
[00:50:12.287 --> 00:50:13.587]  I mean, it's disgusting to be here.
[00:50:13.827 --> 00:50:16.168]  To have this shirt on me right now makes me want to vomit.
[00:50:16.428 --> 00:50:16.868]  To have...
[00:50:17.611 --> 00:50:19.152]  This Stalin picture of Hillary.
[00:50:19.172 --> 00:50:20.952]  And by the way, I'm not being mean to fat people.
[00:50:21.012 --> 00:50:21.953]  I've been overweight as well.
[00:50:22.073 --> 00:50:29.916]  And they have mainstream articles asking the question, why lesbians are three times larger on average than the average woman's weight.
[00:50:30.476 --> 00:50:32.837]  Why are Hillary supporters normally 300 pounds?
[00:50:34.157 --> 00:50:35.218]  I mean, that's another question.
[00:50:35.678 --> 00:50:39.039]  Well, this is the first time I've ever been around this much at one time.
[00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:40.019]  It really makes me nervous.
[00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:43.981]  But as I look around, I do have to say I agree with you there on that one, Alex.
[00:50:44.827 --> 00:50:47.508]  There are a lot of plump Hillary supporters here today.
[00:50:48.788 --> 00:50:51.449]  But because these people are just zombies.
[00:50:52.409 --> 00:50:53.950]  I guarantee you, most of them don't work.
[00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:57.171]  They sit in front of the television all day, watching Oprah Winfrey.
[00:50:57.971 --> 00:50:58.791]  Yeah, they consume all day.
[00:50:58.811 --> 00:50:59.352]  That's all they want.
[00:50:59.372 --> 00:51:02.313]  They're here to find out what other free things they can get to consume as well.
[00:51:02.353 --> 00:51:02.773]  Joe, stay there.
[00:51:02.833 --> 00:51:04.013]  You're doing an incredible job.
[00:51:04.033 --> 00:51:04.473]  Stay right there.
[00:51:04.513 --> 00:51:06.554]  We'll be back with Joe Biggs at the San Antonio to Hillary event.

[00:51:22.918 --> 00:51:26.839]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[00:51:26.879 --> 00:51:29.760]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.260]  Does that sound right to you?

[00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:10.733]  You wouldn't go camping in the Everglades without bug spray, would you?
[00:52:11.314 --> 00:52:15.999]  It's in our nature to protect ourselves, especially when protection is simple and affordable.

[00:53:07.369 --> 00:53:09.710]  The human body is more than 60% water.
[00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:12.791]  Your brain and muscles are 75% water.

[00:54:25.173 --> 00:54:26.415]  Our will is being broken.
[00:54:26.855 --> 00:54:28.216]  Our finances are being destroyed.
[00:54:28.256 --> 00:54:34.442]  We're being maneuvered into total control.
[00:54:35.062 --> 00:54:36.623]  This is 21st century warfare.
[00:54:39.106 --> 00:54:40.487]  And we're not being alarmist here.
[00:54:40.587 --> 00:54:42.649]  We have incrementally been brought into this tyranny.
[00:54:44.713 --> 00:54:50.198]  I was going to have Robert Kiyosaki, who's a great guest, free market guy, on about where he sees the world today.
[00:54:50.378 --> 00:54:51.660]  I am going to move him to next week.
[00:54:54.382 --> 00:55:04.512]  Because we have the breakdown and the transcript.
[00:55:04.732 --> 00:55:06.714]  Richard, can you bring that sheet back in here, please?
[00:55:09.236 --> 00:55:09.877]  I thought I had it.
[00:55:12.271 --> 00:55:20.554]  With the quotes, we now have the video clips ready from the hour and a half Justice Department meeting.
[00:55:20.774 --> 00:55:21.195]  Thank you.
[00:55:23.595 --> 00:55:30.218]  Where it says that the anti-government groups, sovereign citizen movements, are the number one threat.
[00:55:32.259 --> 00:55:36.040]  And the same sentence says, with attacks on synagogues and mosques,
[00:55:40.143 --> 00:55:43.485]  So it's saying that the Patriot groups are going to attack mosques, basically.
[00:55:44.086 --> 00:55:44.766]  And synagogues.
[00:55:46.127 --> 00:55:51.391]  And Domestic Terrorism Initiative announcement, threat of influence on the internet, social media, that'll be the censorship.
[00:55:51.931 --> 00:55:55.313]  The Strong Cities Network, federalizing police, circumventing the states.
[00:55:55.814 --> 00:55:59.837]  And if your governor stands up against it, or your Attorney General, like Texas, they just indict you.
[00:56:05.941 --> 00:56:08.282]  The definition of the Codebook of Domestic Terrorism.
[00:56:10.213 --> 00:56:19.396]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former policy head of the Department of the Treasury, former editor, the editor of the Wall Street Journal, will be joining us on the insanity with Russia and the rest of the world.
[00:56:28.698 --> 00:56:34.160]  And man, when you look at the body language of Biden and the Attorney General in these meetings, they are just crazed.
[00:56:35.626 --> 00:56:38.407]  They're just like, we're coming, we're ready, we're going to fight these people.
[00:56:38.907 --> 00:56:40.468]  We're just sitting here going, what are we doing?
[00:56:40.488 --> 00:56:42.489]  We just don't want you to bankrupt the country and take our guns.
[00:56:43.129 --> 00:56:44.650]  They're like, bitter clingers, we're coming.
[00:56:46.871 --> 00:56:49.312]  Remember those Democratic Party internal circulations?
[00:56:50.912 --> 00:56:54.734]  Where they said, don't worry, the Democrats are going to be in power, don't think we're in trouble.
[00:56:55.094 --> 00:56:59.316]  There's going to be terror attacks in America before Obama leaves office.
[00:56:59.436 --> 00:57:02.457]  This is on Fox News, and the Republicans are going to be blamed.
[00:57:04.483 --> 00:57:07.245]  I mean, when there's an attack, folks, they stand to gain.
[00:57:07.465 --> 00:57:08.786]  They're framing everybody.
[00:57:10.126 --> 00:57:26.516]  I mean, the White House is so evil, and I'm going back to Joe Bigsby with this for five more minutes, they're so evil that they've actually launched an initiative with Soros-funded groups who start the chants, kill the pigs, deck the halls with dead cops.
[00:57:30.779 --> 00:57:32.360]  I mean, that's who runs the government, people.
[00:57:36.254 --> 00:57:37.897]  Do you understand how serious this is?
[00:57:38.398 --> 00:57:40.261]  And people are like, well the cops are corrupt, so what?
[00:57:40.922 --> 00:57:41.924]  It's a trap!
[00:57:42.004 --> 00:57:42.766]  It's a setup!
[00:57:43.707 --> 00:57:47.674]  It's mind control, like projecting and telling the Hispanics that whites all hate them.
[00:57:48.928 --> 00:57:53.150]  Or saying because there's some bad cops out there, out of 3 million cops, that all the cops are bad.
[00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:54.651]  It's all mind control!
[00:57:54.911 --> 00:57:56.151]  It's identity politics!
[00:57:56.431 --> 00:57:57.332]  Putting us in groups!
[00:57:57.892 --> 00:58:10.558]  And it puts the cops in groups, so they follow their orders, they circle their wagons, and then the bosses tell them, go under the feds, go to the Southern Primary Law Center event, go under the UN, and you won't get in trouble if you shoot somebody.
[00:58:12.299 --> 00:58:17.081]  They're politically have to join the cult now, or they're going to indict them or kill them!
[00:58:19.029 --> 00:58:20.245]  God, this is a sick takeover.
[00:58:21.584 --> 00:58:23.205]  I mean, it is just at every level.
[00:58:23.565 --> 00:58:26.647]  Listen, I didn't plug anything this hour, and we need funds to run this operation.
[00:58:26.687 --> 00:58:30.070]  I've got great water filters, free shipping and 10% off.

[00:58:37.174 --> 00:58:40.817]  We got 10% off and free shipping on the storable food.
[00:58:40.837 --> 00:58:41.477]  That's over the top.
[00:58:41.838 --> 00:58:46.721]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:46.941 --> 00:58:47.701]  We need your support.
[00:58:47.842 --> 00:58:48.222]  Thank you.
[00:58:48.502 --> 00:58:49.423]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:49.743 --> 00:58:51.044]  I know it's a scary show, folks.
[00:58:51.104 --> 00:58:51.464]  It's real.
[00:58:52.304 --> 00:58:54.145]  Believe me, imagine me and me, man.
[00:58:54.165 --> 00:58:54.686]  They're gonna come.
[00:58:54.806 --> 00:58:56.426]  Listen, I'm a major target.

[00:59:50.448 --> 00:59:53.569]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:13.524 --> 01:00:14.905]  All right, Alex Jones here live.
[01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:16.326]  Let's fade this down.
[01:00:16.686 --> 01:00:21.290]  During the break, security started coming over to Joe Biggs and the crew, the camera person.
[01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:23.131]  Did Matt or Josh go with him today?
[01:00:25.012 --> 01:00:25.813]  Oh, Michael's down there.
[01:00:26.233 --> 01:00:26.473]  Great.
[01:00:26.954 --> 01:00:28.755]  And our new camera guy doing a great job.
[01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:29.756]  And so they're now circling.
[01:00:29.776 --> 01:00:32.078]  They're inside the Hillary event at one of the city community centers.
[01:00:32.298 --> 01:00:32.998]  He got a pass.
[01:00:33.018 --> 01:00:33.639]  They let him in.
[01:00:34.419 --> 01:00:39.683]  Will they throw him out now because he doesn't agree with her Lord and Savior and might actually do some real coverage?
[01:00:39.703 --> 01:00:40.744]  Joe Biggs, what's happening?
[01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:43.249]  So, there's different guys.
[01:00:43.289 --> 01:00:45.930]  Every time I turn around, there's a different cop hiding behind a bush.
[01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:47.630]  Everybody is staring at me.
[01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:53.552]  The Secret Service keeps... They keep walking around and you'll see them peek around to see what I'm doing.
[01:00:53.592 --> 01:00:55.192]  You know, they know exactly who I am.
[01:00:56.112 --> 01:00:58.073]  And it's going to be interesting to see what happens.
[01:00:58.093 --> 01:01:04.634]  I think they're all just kind of like trying to get a perimeter around me to see what kind of hijinks I'm going to pull, which obviously I am because, I mean, that's what I do.
[01:01:05.697 --> 01:01:07.178]  But nothing illegal.
[01:01:07.278 --> 01:01:08.819]  I mean, you're just there to cover it.
[01:01:08.919 --> 01:01:12.481]  And you're there so they can try to arrest you and look like tyrants they are.
[01:01:13.362 --> 01:01:15.963]  The guy at the front gate obviously doesn't know how to do his job.
[01:01:16.444 --> 01:01:17.304]  That's his own fault.
[01:01:17.364 --> 01:01:19.165]  So if anybody's to blame, it'll be that guy.
[01:01:20.106 --> 01:01:20.866]  I'm not on the list.
[01:01:21.387 --> 01:01:23.448]  Well, no, I mean, the guy's not being a tyrant, Joe.
[01:01:23.468 --> 01:01:24.208]  I mean, they let you in.
[01:01:25.709 --> 01:01:35.195]  Yeah, and I even got this completely horrible Hillary Clinton Stalin t-shirt with my credentialed Hillary Clinton pass that
[01:01:36.624 --> 01:01:39.186]  And I have some posters and some goodies for us to bring back.
[01:01:39.226 --> 01:01:43.428]  Don't you love how Obama and her always copy communist iconography?
[01:01:43.488 --> 01:01:44.609]  I mean, it's so in our face.
[01:01:44.909 --> 01:01:45.510]  Hey, listen, look.
[01:01:45.610 --> 01:01:45.870]  Come here.
[01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:46.630]  Get another shot of this.
[01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:47.871]  I mean, this is just out of control.
[01:01:48.451 --> 01:01:49.292]  You got to get this picture.
[01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:50.673]  Oh, we've been showing it.
[01:01:51.933 --> 01:01:58.818]  It's just reminds me of watching like an old war movie when they're overseas.
[01:01:58.898 --> 01:01:59.498]  It's just right.
[01:01:59.558 --> 01:02:00.259]  I can't believe it.
[01:02:00.899 --> 01:02:04.041]  Can you believe they say that they're going to have a war with the Patriots?
[01:02:04.061 --> 01:02:05.102]  They're really going to do it, Joe.
[01:02:05.956 --> 01:02:09.240]  I'm sure there's always going to be a few redcoats or a few turncoats who are going to
[01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:23.493]  You know what?
[01:02:23.513 --> 01:02:24.073]  Screw you.
[01:02:24.134 --> 01:02:24.915]  I'm going over here.
[01:02:24.995 --> 01:02:25.916]  I'm staying with my people.
[01:02:38.826 --> 01:02:39.887]  I'm not going to follow those orders.
[01:02:39.927 --> 01:02:48.273]  I mean, we keep seeing sheriff after sheriff across the country stand up and come out and publicly state, make a YouTube video, or have... That's right, and that's the answer.
[01:02:48.333 --> 01:02:52.677]  You enemies, you usurpers, you scum, can't get us all.
[01:02:53.057 --> 01:02:53.697]  That's the key.
[01:02:53.717 --> 01:02:59.582]  Yeah, everyone's starting to speak out, you know, and it's good when you have these sheriffs coming out and saying, hey, I'm going to follow the Constitution.
[01:02:59.922 --> 01:03:02.624]  If you give me an unlawful order, I will not follow it.
[01:03:02.884 --> 01:03:03.645]  I will not go out.
[01:03:03.685 --> 01:03:04.806]  I will not take people's guns.
[01:03:04.846 --> 01:03:06.367]  I will not force people to do
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:09.261]  You know, something that's against the Constitution, and that's great.
[01:03:09.301 --> 01:03:18.523]  It's great that these sheriffs are coming out, like the ones in Houston, the ones all across, like, uh... And they're going to try to demoralize us and tell us we're losing if the Civil War kicks off.
[01:03:18.743 --> 01:03:20.043]  We're not losing, we're winning.
[01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:20.923]  Always remember that.
[01:03:21.303 --> 01:03:25.584]  As long as you're fighting back in the Info War, and defending yourself if you have to, you're winning.
[01:03:26.205 --> 01:03:27.965]  Resistance is victory, Joe, isn't it?
[01:03:28.625 --> 01:03:29.425]  Well, look at this, though.
[01:03:29.445 --> 01:03:30.346]  I want to show it really quick.
[01:03:33.786 --> 01:03:34.226]  There you go.
[01:03:34.286 --> 01:03:34.707]  That's right.
[01:03:34.727 --> 01:03:35.927]  The Hillary for prison shirt.
[01:03:36.883 --> 01:03:38.285]  That's exactly where she needs to go.
[01:03:38.345 --> 01:03:40.727]  These people, we need a Nuremberg trial in this country.
[01:03:41.368 --> 01:03:43.430]  Joe, what's the schedule down there?
[01:03:44.511 --> 01:03:50.437]  Right now, she is at an event at the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce right now.
[01:03:50.878 --> 01:03:52.740]  And that's like, it seemed to be a private event.
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:54.422]  This is the public event here.
[01:03:54.442 --> 01:03:55.763]  So everybody's been lining up.
[01:03:56.063 --> 01:03:57.845]  We pulled up in San Antonio.
[01:03:57.885 --> 01:03:58.546]  They were literally
[01:03:59.025 --> 01:04:02.148]  Probably 400 people wrapped around the road waiting to come in here.
[01:04:02.469 --> 01:04:03.810]  And this place is starting to pack in.
[01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:05.913]  They've got the front packed in here.
[01:04:06.033 --> 01:04:14.162]  The people on the stage, it looks like a lot of Hispanic women are up on the stage out there and they keep doing these little Hillary chants back and forth from time to time.
[01:04:14.202 --> 01:04:20.929]  And then they have free water and they took the water and they took the labels off and they put Hillary Clinton labels on the water.
[01:04:22.008 --> 01:04:23.129]  And they're giving that out for free.
[01:04:23.229 --> 01:04:25.530]  Well, they have the kids pray in Venezuela.
[01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:27.071]  I used to hear this, but then it was on the news.
[01:04:28.412 --> 01:04:35.477]  They have the kids pray in kindergarten, first grade, for milk from Jesus and cereal, and it isn't there.
[01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:40.581]  And then they say pray to Hugo Chavez when he was alive, but now he's dead, and then they give him the milk.
[01:04:41.261 --> 01:04:44.884]  And then if they really pray hard, they give them a little sugar cube.
[01:04:44.904 --> 01:04:46.886]  And it's just Pavlovian brainwashing.
[01:04:46.926 --> 01:04:51.129]  Joe, we're going to keep monitoring what you're doing while Paul Craig Roberts is on with us.
[01:04:51.529 --> 01:04:53.891]  So stay connected, walk around, cover whatever you want.
[01:04:54.292 --> 01:04:59.156]  And then if you give us a mayday signal, if they're jumping on you, we'll go right back to you.
[01:04:59.496 --> 01:05:01.417]  Joe Biggs reporting from San Antonio.
[01:05:01.758 --> 01:05:03.339]  He'll be popping in throughout the hours.
[01:05:03.679 --> 01:05:06.862]  We're going to play these clips coming up in the next hour.
[01:05:08.635 --> 01:05:17.482]  In yet another land grab, the BLM, the Bureau of Land Management, is ignoring the real estate title given by the state of Texas 74 years ago to a farmer.
[01:05:18.002 --> 01:05:28.130]  Now the same bureaucracy that has ignored property rights for ranchers like Cliven Bundy in Nevada, ignored property rights for miners in Oregon and elsewhere, is coming after the property of a Texas farmer.
[01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:32.534]  The BLM has decided they will move the boundary, take half his land and his house.
[01:05:33.214 --> 01:05:35.615]  Congress has allowed bureaucracies to grow unchecked.
[01:05:35.955 --> 01:05:45.177]  Because Congress doesn't like to pass laws, they have abdicated their constitutional duty to bureaucracies, who not only write the law, but often act as their own police force and run their own court.
[01:05:45.797 --> 01:05:48.458]  No one in either party in Washington wants to change it.
[01:05:49.238 --> 01:06:01.822]  These bureaucracies will destroy every last remnant of your God-given, constitutionally protected rights, including your property rights, unless they are stopped by you, by the people, at the state and the local level.
[01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:05.277]  For more information, go to InfoWars.com.

[01:08:14.864 --> 01:08:17.146]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:22.782 --> 01:08:35.148]  For the next 52 minutes, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of policy at the Treasury, the father of Reaganomics, former chief editor at the Wall Street Journal, will be joining us.
[01:08:35.288 --> 01:08:37.349]  He's been part of some of the biggest foundations.
[01:08:37.389 --> 01:08:42.031]  He was part of the deal for the transition of the Soviet Union into what it is today.
[01:08:43.416 --> 01:08:46.960]  He's won some of the top international awards.
[01:08:47.781 --> 01:08:49.322]  And of course, he doesn't really talk about that.
[01:08:49.342 --> 01:08:50.904]  The point is, he has a lot of gravitas.
[01:08:50.944 --> 01:08:53.506]  He is a high-level economist.
[01:08:53.907 --> 01:08:57.090]  He's been listed in major publications as one of the top ten economists in the last 50 years.
[01:08:58.584 --> 01:09:02.266]  He knows what he's talking about, and obviously we're going to try to get into the economy some today.
[01:09:02.746 --> 01:09:05.407]  That's clearly deteriorating, where he thinks that's going.
[01:09:05.928 --> 01:09:13.832]  The situation with Russia, the fact that the momentum has shifted, and the world really is turning against the criminals that run the United States.
[01:09:14.072 --> 01:09:14.892]  They're not invincible.
[01:09:15.713 --> 01:09:23.657]  And once they start failing on any front, their whole system will collapse, like Napoleon or Hitler marching into Russia.
[01:09:24.877 --> 01:09:26.298]  And we use that analogy for a reason.
[01:09:27.895 --> 01:09:53.671]  But first off, I'm going to be writing a big article today with Paul Watson and going over the fact, and I want to get Robert's take on this, because you talked a lot about the police state, the billions of bullets, the armored vehicles, the Army Times admitting it's for the Tea Party and gun owners, Ron Paul's former chief of staff, Rand Paul's former chief of staff, indicted for nothing, for giving
[01:09:55.376 --> 01:09:58.758]  Campaign money to Libertarians to have them run for office.
[01:09:58.778 --> 01:10:02.781]  They're calling that's a payoff for endorsing, you know, Rand Paul or something.
[01:10:02.841 --> 01:10:03.962]  Just, just incredible.
[01:10:05.263 --> 01:10:06.724]  They've indicted the Texas Attorney General.
[01:10:07.064 --> 01:10:09.265]  I know they're trying to indict the governor of Texas.
[01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:11.747]  This is real political persecution.
[01:10:12.147 --> 01:10:14.449]  People flying battle flags in Georgia.
[01:10:14.509 --> 01:10:18.231]  Fifteen of them have been charged with terrorism because they flew them on their trucks in a park.
[01:10:19.232 --> 01:10:20.353]  And people's feelings were hurt.
[01:10:22.094 --> 01:10:22.854]  And they're being charged.
[01:10:22.874 --> 01:10:24.856]  We showed the video from the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:10:25.828 --> 01:10:29.129]  They're being charged for driving away, saying, we'll see you guys, have a good day.
[01:10:35.031 --> 01:10:36.911]  This is the new persecution.
[01:10:36.991 --> 01:10:38.592]  Radical Muslims pouring into Europe.
[01:10:39.272 --> 01:10:41.573]  If you criticize them, you're arrested, your children are taken.
[01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:48.094]  Zuckerberg caught on tape saying, you know, he's going to censor the web.
[01:10:49.995 --> 01:10:50.335]  It's here.
[01:10:51.355 --> 01:10:53.076]  It's to a new level, and now.
[01:10:55.711 --> 01:10:58.514]  And I want to get his take on this, then we'll get into Russia and the geopolitical issues.
[01:11:00.336 --> 01:11:01.958]  And in the next hour, I'm going to play these clips.
[01:11:02.238 --> 01:11:06.282]  No one has covered this yet, but UPI and the Justice Department put a press release out.
[01:11:06.542 --> 01:11:07.523]  This is so huge.
[01:11:08.404 --> 01:11:17.134]  We're going to play the video clips here where they say that they're basically preparing for a civil war with the Tea Party, libertarians, conservatives.
[01:11:18.404 --> 01:11:38.580]  And they're preparing for acts of terror by the Tea Party, and that through the Safe Cities move, with the United Nations directing it, they're going to federalize local police, and they're creating a new Justice Department anti-terror unit, basically run by the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL, to go out and politically target people.
[01:11:41.482 --> 01:11:45.606]  And this is the main new national security position.
[01:11:46.425 --> 01:11:54.551]  For the Domestic Terrorism Council saying that homegrown, libertarian, conservative terror will be the new menace.
[01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:56.693]  Now, we got the secret documents six, seven years ago.
[01:11:56.753 --> 01:11:57.193]  We broke them.
[01:11:57.514 --> 01:11:58.194]  People didn't believe it.
[01:11:58.214 --> 01:12:04.299]  It was confirmed real when they said Ron Paul, you know, Aaron Russo's film, Infowars and some of the documents.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:08.642]  If you see somebody with a get us out of the UN sticker on their car, go ahead and arrest them.
[01:12:09.923 --> 01:12:12.685]  So they're trying to get the police to believe free speech is illegal.
[01:12:13.426 --> 01:12:14.507]  And it's starting to happen.
[01:12:17.867 --> 01:12:23.030]  And so, clearly they're going to pull, I believe, some false flags and try to frame the Liberty Movement.
[01:12:23.871 --> 01:12:26.993]  Clearly, they've tried to frame Russia for events Russia didn't commit.
[01:12:27.013 --> 01:12:29.274]  They tried to frame Syria for chemical attacks they didn't commit.
[01:12:29.874 --> 01:12:33.356]  Our government is clearly funding ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[01:12:33.557 --> 01:12:37.479]  The former head of Defense Intelligence went public and said they were ordered to do that two months ago.
[01:12:37.539 --> 01:12:38.319]  We've played that clip.
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:42.582]  So the good news is there's a lot of people in government speaking out against this.
[01:12:42.982 --> 01:12:45.584]  Foreign ministers are saying they believe Obama is mentally ill.
[01:12:47.759 --> 01:12:52.641]  The neocons are clearly mentally ill, but we've always talked about this tyranny cresting.
[01:12:52.741 --> 01:12:55.182]  And historically, tyrants don't quit.
[01:12:56.083 --> 01:12:57.203]  They always go too far.
[01:12:58.564 --> 01:13:03.846]  And in World War II, more than 50 million people died, most of them civilians.
[01:13:05.771 --> 01:13:10.896]  And many historians are saying the parallels to World War I, World War II, the Cuban Missile Crisis, or Legion.
[01:13:10.916 --> 01:13:17.463]  So we'll get into Russia, get into the economy, but first before we go to break in about six, seven minutes, Dr. Roberts joins us.
[01:13:17.483 --> 01:13:18.504]  His website is excellent.
[01:13:18.524 --> 01:13:22.408]  You can read his syndicated column there, paulcraigroberts.org.
[01:13:24.775 --> 01:13:27.237]  His most recent book is titled, How America Was Lost.
[01:13:27.958 --> 01:13:30.721]  And I have never been in such deep mourning, Dr. Roberts.
[01:13:31.602 --> 01:13:38.569]  And I know you've been not cynical, but almost gallows humor laughing about this yourself.
[01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:43.952]  I am just struggling with my instinct to get my family out of the country.
[01:13:44.513 --> 01:13:46.374]  I've pledged to stay here and try to fight this.
[01:13:46.454 --> 01:13:53.758]  I know I couldn't live with myself if I didn't stay, but I know for a fact that they've got the FBI for two years digging into me under White House orders.
[01:13:54.219 --> 01:13:56.980]  I've confirmed this from people in the government, directly with agents.
[01:13:58.141 --> 01:14:02.704]  And the FBI can't find anything, so they're being ordered now.
[01:14:03.664 --> 01:14:08.327]  And I was told, well, new units are going to be created, and they're creating political offices that are going to go after everybody.
[01:14:09.702 --> 01:14:15.869]  Um, and now you see what's happening in the polls, and I've told people before, it was even in the news, they were going to indict the Attorney General in Texas.
[01:14:15.889 --> 01:14:17.810]  You know, I have obviously a lot of high-level sources.
[01:14:17.831 --> 01:14:19.712]  I know you have a lot of high-level sources as well.
[01:14:20.573 --> 01:14:27.821]  Uh, but this really is the breaking of America right now, and the long breath before the plunge, in my view, to total totalitarianism.
[01:14:27.861 --> 01:14:29.302]  And I think they're probably going to arrest you too.
[01:14:29.923 --> 01:14:30.844]  Uh, what do you have to say about that?
[01:14:32.691 --> 01:14:35.793]  Well, I think all of it's possible except the part about the U.N.
[01:14:35.813 --> 01:14:38.155]  It won't have anything to do with the U.N.
[01:14:38.175 --> 01:14:39.816]  It certainly won't be managed by the U.N.
[01:14:39.836 --> 01:14:43.799]  Well, I'm not saying they're going to run it, but they say under treaty and under agreement.
[01:14:43.819 --> 01:14:45.220]  I can show you Associated Press.
[01:14:46.121 --> 01:14:48.422]  It'll have nothing whatsoever to do with the U.N.
[01:14:48.442 --> 01:14:50.984]  Okay, well break it down in your view then what I just talked about.
[01:14:52.565 --> 01:14:57.529]  Well, it'll strike most people as Alex has gone further off the wall.
[01:14:59.092 --> 01:15:06.240]  But I do think that we have seen many signs of the police state.
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:20.496]  In fact, we can say that it was established when the George W. Bush administration announced that it had the right
[01:15:21.584 --> 01:15:31.755]  To detain American citizens indefinitely without presentation of evidence or without a warrant or without going to a court.
[01:15:33.597 --> 01:15:40.284]  The fact that they got away with that was all you need to know that there was a police state because that's strictly unconstitutional.
[01:15:40.425 --> 01:15:41.566]  Nothing was done about it.
[01:15:44.507 --> 01:15:47.728]  The Justice Department is so totally corrupt.
[01:15:47.768 --> 01:16:01.052]  They were writing, having memos written to justify the assumption of dictatorial power by the president, placing his actions above constitutional control.
[01:16:01.072 --> 01:16:09.375]  The two parties involved in these memos, one of them is now a professor of constitutional law.
[01:16:11.089 --> 01:16:17.551]  The University of California, Berkeley, Boalt School of Law, and the other is a federal judge.
[01:16:19.391 --> 01:16:26.153]  So, this is all you need to see that it's a police state.
[01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:35.695]  The Berkeley Law School took a guy who wrote memos justifying torture, which is strictly illegal under both U.S.
[01:16:35.755 --> 01:16:37.496]  law and under
[01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:46.630]  Of course, John Yoo, Alberto Gonzalez, and others openly said they could even bury people alive, rip their fingernails out, do anything they wanted.
[01:16:48.951 --> 01:16:52.231]  John Yoo wrote the memo, and this other guy, I think, what was his name, was it Bate?
[01:16:52.471 --> 01:16:52.691]  Batey?
[01:16:52.731 --> 01:16:55.972]  Batey, or something like that.
[01:16:56.012 --> 01:17:00.153]  Yes, the issue is, though, it was adopted by the government as if it was legitimate.
[01:17:02.234 --> 01:17:06.615]  Well, it was asserted by the Bush administration.
[01:17:09.225 --> 01:17:19.314]  And the Department of Justice had these guys write these memos that had no basis in law to justify an assertion of power.
[01:17:19.515 --> 01:17:21.076]  And nobody did anything about it.
[01:17:21.116 --> 01:17:23.258]  The Congress didn't do anything about it, the courts.
[01:17:24.019 --> 01:17:28.062]  So that showed that there was a police statement.
[01:17:28.082 --> 01:17:31.425]  Of course, then Bush's successor had a chance to correct all that.
[01:17:31.886 --> 01:17:34.748]  Instead, he just went further because he added
[01:17:35.789 --> 01:17:36.229]  I don't know.
[01:17:56.823 --> 01:18:03.547]  You have a police state, and I think also when you see the continuing murder of unarmed U.S.
[01:18:03.587 --> 01:18:19.556]  citizens by the police who are supposed to be protecting them, and very, very little accountability of the police who commit these crimes, in most cases nothing happens to them, then you can see again
[01:18:20.797 --> 01:18:24.419]  That American citizens no longer have the protection of law.
[01:18:24.519 --> 01:18:26.620]  They're not even safe from their own police.
[01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:32.303]  And the police murder and abuse at will, and very, very little, if anything, happens.
[01:18:32.723 --> 01:18:38.626]  It's very rare that a police officer is held accountable for his crimes.
[01:18:39.546 --> 01:18:43.888]  So I think that's about all the evidence you really need, Alex.
[01:18:44.008 --> 01:18:48.951]  And I don't know how... Well, the point I'm getting to is they are
[01:18:50.031 --> 01:18:50.731]  Heating it up.
[01:18:50.991 --> 01:18:55.653]  They are clearly going after people like Dinesh D'Souza for a speech.
[01:18:56.093 --> 01:18:58.074]  They're clearly going after Rand Paul now.
[01:18:59.075 --> 01:19:03.637]  They're clearly... The persecution is accelerating.
[01:19:04.157 --> 01:19:14.001]  And the Justice Department, to be clear, and I have Associated Press right here, I understand that it's not the UN that's going to run it all, but the UN, they're following UN guidelines.
[01:19:15.094 --> 01:19:20.216]  in a UN initiative on the quote hate speech to restrict free speech.
[01:19:20.236 --> 01:19:25.578]  So they're claiming that as their authorization and as their directive.
[01:19:25.998 --> 01:19:27.619]  Look, they can claim anything.
[01:19:27.639 --> 01:19:34.481]  I just told you if they can claim that the president is above the law and not subject to constitutional restraint, they can claim anything.
[01:19:34.561 --> 01:19:35.402]  That's what I'm getting at.
[01:19:35.462 --> 01:19:38.223]  So I'm saying the fact that they're creating a new anti-terrorism unit
[01:19:38.903 --> 01:19:43.727]  And saying they're preparing for this conflagration, obviously we've seen their past activities.
[01:19:44.567 --> 01:19:48.550]  What I'm saying is they're moving into a new level of draconian action in my view.
[01:19:51.052 --> 01:19:51.813]  No doubt about it.
[01:19:53.133 --> 01:19:55.936]  I mean just look at the persecution of whistleblowers.
[01:19:56.886 --> 01:20:04.449]  So I think that this is, this is all realistic and it doesn't need to be understated or overstated.
[01:20:04.569 --> 01:20:05.670]  It's just a fact.
[01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:11.752]  You know, at the time when they, when Bush made that announcement, he could put Americans under indebted detention.
[01:20:12.333 --> 01:20:17.655]  I said, this, this will be covered up with the claim that he's only doing this to terrorists.
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:21.762]  But once you breach that, you do it to everybody.
[01:20:21.982 --> 01:20:27.566]  I've pointed out over and over and over that the law expands to the limits of its logic.
[01:20:27.586 --> 01:20:28.026]  That's right.
[01:20:28.507 --> 01:20:32.389]  I just act like the RICO Act was only to get the mafia.
[01:20:32.469 --> 01:20:34.391]  Now it's used in divorce courts.
[01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:35.452]  That's right.
[01:20:36.232 --> 01:20:38.854]  So, it's clear it's going to go that way.
[01:20:38.874 --> 01:20:48.440]  The real question is, if they are busy at war with their own people, how are they going to be at war everywhere else?
[01:20:49.101 --> 01:20:52.123]  Much less with Russia and China.
[01:20:53.864 --> 01:20:57.887]  And I think that one of the signs of hope
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:06.185]  Is the two speeches that Obama and Putin gave at the UN on the 28th of September.
[01:21:06.765 --> 01:21:18.613]  Because the whole world saw that Obama was a stooge, a liar, a deceiver, and that Putin was a statesman who told the truth and stood up.
[01:21:19.594 --> 01:21:23.256]  So I think you've seen a sea change in the power in the world.
[01:21:23.436 --> 01:21:25.598]  The United States is no longer a unipower.
[01:21:26.687 --> 01:21:33.909]  It's a semi-superpower, certainly behind the Russians, probably also behind the Chinese.
[01:21:34.710 --> 01:21:41.312]  And so the alteration of the American position in the world, and look at what's happening to the empire.
[01:21:42.432 --> 01:21:44.233]  Look what's happening in Europe.
[01:21:44.513 --> 01:21:54.216]  Europe is being overrun with refugees that doesn't want, has no place for, all because the idiot Europeans
[01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:58.902]  enabled Washington's wars in the Middle East.
[01:21:59.982 --> 01:22:03.384]  So they've got to be sitting there thinking, what dolts we were.
[01:22:03.464 --> 01:22:07.286]  Look what we get for being Washington's vassals.
[01:22:08.787 --> 01:22:13.949]  They also now, having seen Russia stand up and simply tell us no.
[01:22:14.029 --> 01:22:20.893]  You know, the statement that Putin made was that we can no longer tolerate the state of affairs in the world.
[01:22:21.213 --> 01:22:23.254]  That is a declarative sentence.
[01:22:24.116 --> 01:22:26.857]  It says, that's it, we're not putting up with anything else.
[01:22:27.097 --> 01:22:29.298]  Two days later, he's taken over the war in Syria.
[01:22:30.018 --> 01:22:31.399]  We can't do anything about it.
[01:22:31.419 --> 01:22:32.540]  Bluster.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.281]  So the power in the world has changed.
[01:22:36.341 --> 01:22:38.262]  We've lost our moral high ground.
[01:22:38.742 --> 01:22:39.702]  We've never had it.
[01:22:40.263 --> 01:22:41.803]  We've lost the pretense of it.
[01:22:41.883 --> 01:22:42.284]  Yes.
[01:22:42.824 --> 01:22:43.024]  Yeah.
[01:22:43.324 --> 01:22:45.545]  We've lost the mask is off.
[01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:50.257]  And the world looks at us totally different.
[01:22:50.317 --> 01:22:55.919]  They say, hey, look, we don't have to be afraid of the bully anymore because we've got the Russians and Chinese standing up to them.
[01:22:57.060 --> 01:22:58.821]  And even the Iranians stood up to us.
[01:23:01.002 --> 01:23:10.467]  So I think that, you know, how is a country that's beleaguered abroad, whose empire is tottering, is now going to make war on its own people?
[01:23:11.587 --> 01:23:14.629]  I believe, I believe you're probably right that they intend to do that.
[01:23:17.855 --> 01:23:20.218]  You know, you go from weakness to weakness.
[01:23:20.859 --> 01:23:21.380]  No, I agree.
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:26.967]  The good news is is they're so discredited and people in government are pretty upset that I talked to too.
[01:23:27.007 --> 01:23:28.429]  I think the mask is coming off here.
[01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:30.692]  And so a lot of this may just be bluster.
[01:23:30.712 --> 01:23:33.997]  I mean, it's going to get really obvious if they indict every member of the Tea Party.
[01:23:34.577 --> 01:23:35.679]  It could be.
[01:23:35.739 --> 01:23:40.625]  I'm told that today I was told, but you know, you never know what people tell you.
[01:23:40.665 --> 01:23:44.389]  They're trying to plant ideas or stories or they got an agenda.
[01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:53.660]  But I was told today something that sort of surprised me and that is that there's a tremendous amount of opposition within police forces themselves.
[01:23:54.724 --> 01:24:09.074]  To this militarization of the police, to these brutal acts, and that the situation is not quite what it looks like on the surface.
[01:24:09.174 --> 01:24:10.975]  Now, if this is true... No, I agree with that.
[01:24:12.096 --> 01:24:14.057]  If this is true, it's good news.
[01:24:14.097 --> 01:24:21.342]  Now, if they're going to start indicting Attorney Generals of Texas and the Governor and ruining U.S.
[01:24:21.462 --> 01:24:23.864]  Senators, people will see that.
[01:24:25.558 --> 01:24:28.220]  And you got to remember, too, the polls, Alex.
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:34.405]  You remember not long ago, we saw the poll that 62% of Americans favored a third party.
[01:24:35.366 --> 01:24:36.487]  This is brand new.
[01:24:38.348 --> 01:24:43.512]  We saw that 75% of Americans thought that government at all levels was corrupt.
[01:24:44.653 --> 01:24:45.574]  This is brand new.
[01:24:46.835 --> 01:24:47.956]  If these polls are correct.
[01:24:49.317 --> 01:24:53.581]  And so perhaps you've been successful in waking people up.
[01:24:54.465 --> 01:24:55.806]  Well, I think we all have together.
[01:24:56.046 --> 01:24:57.407]  You certainly and others get credit.
[01:24:57.907 --> 01:25:01.569]  They see the polls as kind of the tip of the spear, because they know they're for real as well.
[01:25:01.649 --> 01:25:06.311]  But what do you expect, though, with the history of hubris and being in Washington?
[01:25:06.331 --> 01:25:10.933]  I mean, obviously, we weren't perfect then, but compared to the Soviet Union, I'd say we were the good guys.
[01:25:10.993 --> 01:25:11.654]  And you were there.
[01:25:11.674 --> 01:25:13.755]  Reagan, tear down that wall.
[01:25:14.295 --> 01:25:15.936]  That did put pressure on the Russians.
[01:25:16.016 --> 01:25:17.176]  It did help reform things.
[01:25:17.597 --> 01:25:25.700]  And we now see a shift where it's like Putin's like Reagan saying to us, stop being tyrants and saying, look what you've done in the Middle East funding ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:26.841]  Shame on you.
[01:25:27.341 --> 01:25:29.182]  Just it's like the emperor's new clothes.
[01:25:29.602 --> 01:25:31.283]  Putin really is being a statesman.
[01:25:31.683 --> 01:25:33.844]  What do you expect them to do now to try to counter that?
[01:25:34.524 --> 01:25:36.685]  I think the CIA will try to assassinate him.
[01:25:39.006 --> 01:25:42.268]  I think Putin's in substantial danger of assassination.
[01:25:44.814 --> 01:25:45.575]  That's what I think.
[01:25:47.876 --> 01:25:52.038]  And I hope he stops walking around the streets unprotected.
[01:25:53.859 --> 01:25:55.380]  No American president can do that.
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:57.141]  Only Putin.
[01:25:58.621 --> 01:26:00.002]  Well, he's not a coward, that's for sure.
[01:26:00.703 --> 01:26:02.964]  Well, I mean, the people there don't want to kill him.
[01:26:05.228 --> 01:26:12.594]  So I think that Putin's in danger of assassination by the CIA or some rogue group.
[01:26:12.614 --> 01:26:15.536]  They're probably rogue groups that are far worse than the CIA.
[01:26:15.737 --> 01:26:17.018]  Of course.
[01:26:17.258 --> 01:26:18.779]  And we just don't know about them.
[01:26:20.672 --> 01:26:28.600]  So I think here they will continue to persecute whistleblowers.
[01:26:30.202 --> 01:26:38.511]  They will continue to move in the direction that criticism of the government is illegal.
[01:26:40.279 --> 01:26:45.261]  And they'll first say, you know, you're a domestic extremist.
[01:26:45.621 --> 01:26:52.464]  And they'll find somebody that's easy for people not to like and go along with.
[01:26:52.564 --> 01:26:57.806]  And then the next guy will not quite be so easy to dislike.
[01:26:57.846 --> 01:26:59.366]  And then finally they'll get whoever they want.
[01:26:59.446 --> 01:27:00.427]  That's the way it goes.
[01:27:00.527 --> 01:27:00.987]  Exactly.
[01:27:02.427 --> 01:27:05.769]  So I think that is in motion.
[01:27:07.293 --> 01:27:10.274]  I do think now there's more awareness.
[01:27:13.255 --> 01:27:21.138]  I don't know to what agreement they would be able to bring military officers.
[01:27:23.199 --> 01:27:28.501]  Some of them I know are useless and rotten and no good and others have integrity.
[01:27:29.461 --> 01:27:32.602]  So it's not a clear open road for them.
[01:27:35.023 --> 01:27:38.545]  I think you're right that they're going in this direction.
[01:27:40.405 --> 01:27:43.907]  But whether they can pull it off, I don't know.
[01:27:43.967 --> 01:27:47.248]  I think they're going to have more problems than they can handle.
[01:27:47.268 --> 01:27:48.369]  For example, the economy.
[01:27:49.309 --> 01:27:50.810]  I can't really stay the whole hour.
[01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:51.950]  I understand.
[01:27:51.970 --> 01:27:52.751]  They told me an hour before.
[01:27:52.771 --> 01:27:53.591]  I know you've got to go.
[01:27:53.611 --> 01:27:54.352]  Can you do 10 more minutes?
[01:27:54.372 --> 01:27:55.112]  Tell us about the economy?
[01:27:55.652 --> 01:27:58.053]  Yeah, because that's another problem for them.
[01:27:58.934 --> 01:28:01.355]  And all of these things can overwhelm them.
[01:28:03.109 --> 01:28:05.171]  I mean, the thing can collapse out from under them.
[01:28:05.211 --> 01:28:08.574]  I mean, the economy, you know, look, it's a house of cards.
[01:28:08.594 --> 01:28:09.455]  We've talked about it.
[01:28:09.495 --> 01:28:15.180]  They've kept it up by creating money to sustain all the bad investments the banks made.
[01:28:17.024 --> 01:28:19.626]  But the economy itself is not growing.
[01:28:20.767 --> 01:28:22.168]  Retail sales aren't growing.
[01:28:22.389 --> 01:28:24.330]  Real consumer incomes are declining.
[01:28:25.391 --> 01:28:26.412]  They're going down.
[01:28:27.373 --> 01:28:30.615]  There's no basis for the economy to grow.
[01:28:30.695 --> 01:28:39.323]  They create the image of success by manipulating the figures and the way they measure unemployment, the way they measure inflation.
[01:28:40.223 --> 01:28:47.670]  And so they're trying to create a matrix, an image of success that's not there.
[01:28:54.705 --> 01:28:55.546]  It's rigged.
[01:28:55.606 --> 01:28:56.627]  It's the only way it can stand.
[01:28:56.687 --> 01:29:02.011]  It's rigged because of the Japanese print to support it, the European Central Bank prints to support it.
[01:29:02.892 --> 01:29:04.433]  But now look what's happening in Europe.
[01:29:04.934 --> 01:29:09.938]  I mean, they're overwhelmed with their own sovereign debt problems, now with millions of refugees.
[01:29:09.958 --> 01:29:10.778]  Well, we're going to break.
[01:29:10.798 --> 01:29:19.365]  We'll come back and do five minutes on the other side and let you just focus in on a briefing, you know, as a former top economist in the White House, on where you see this going.
[01:29:19.385 --> 01:29:21.707]  And I want to ask you when we come back, that other key question.
[01:29:22.828 --> 01:29:27.691]  What does it signify that other central banks and now the Chinese are not buying as many U.S.
[01:29:27.791 --> 01:29:28.411]  Treasuries?
[01:29:29.472 --> 01:29:32.293]  They're saying the economy's not as good as it was previously.
[01:29:32.754 --> 01:29:36.856]  I want to find out from you as an economist where you think the real state of the U.S.
[01:29:36.896 --> 01:29:39.817]  versus the global economy is and what you expect to come next.
[01:29:39.837 --> 01:29:43.760]  Dr. Paul Greg Roberts will do five, six minutes with us on the other side of the break.
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:46.883]  His website is paulcraigroberts.org.
[01:29:47.343 --> 01:29:53.931]  And then I'm going to get into a bunch of the election news, a bunch of the Europe news, Second Amendment news.
[01:29:54.011 --> 01:29:54.752]  It's all coming up.
[01:29:54.772 --> 01:29:55.253]  Stay with us.
[01:29:57.415 --> 01:29:58.316]  We're on the march.
[01:29:58.817 --> 01:30:00.418]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:04.023]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:08.283 --> 01:30:13.829]  Indiana Sheriff Brad Rogers made his stance on the Second Amendment clear during a recent interview.
[01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:24.399]  If President Obama today said, I'm creating an executive order that all sheriffs and police chiefs around this nation need to start registering firearms, I will disregard it.
[01:30:24.639 --> 01:30:34.365]  Presidential candidate Jim Webb defended the Second Amendment rights of Americans during the first Democratic debate and he actually called out his fellow politicians on their hypocrisy.
[01:30:34.525 --> 01:30:42.150]  There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[01:30:42.511 --> 01:30:47.514]  The average American does not have that and deserves the right to be able to protect their family.
[01:30:47.794 --> 01:30:52.136]  And Webb's point echoes recent comments made by media pioneer Matt Drudge.
[01:30:52.536 --> 01:30:53.696]  I challenge Hillary.
[01:30:53.956 --> 01:30:55.477]  Take away your secret service.
[01:30:55.757 --> 01:30:56.577]  Dismiss them.
[01:30:57.037 --> 01:30:57.577]  I dare you.
[01:30:57.878 --> 01:30:58.838]  Obama, same thing.
[01:30:59.078 --> 01:31:00.839]  Leave the White House unguarded, Obama.
[01:31:00.859 --> 01:31:02.519]  You know what would happen in 30 seconds?
[01:31:03.059 --> 01:31:05.040]  Both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth.
[01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:07.661]  Read more now at InfoWars.com.

[01:31:37.765 --> 01:31:38.706]  BrainForce is here.
[01:31:38.906 --> 01:31:41.007]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:31:41.107 --> 01:31:45.829]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:31:46.110 --> 01:31:49.271]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:31:49.391 --> 01:31:52.613]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:31:52.873 --> 01:31:54.694]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:31:54.854 --> 01:31:58.836]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.
[01:31:58.956 --> 01:32:04.559]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:07.481 --> 01:32:08.382]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:32:08.442 --> 01:32:08.863]  Good, brother.
[01:32:09.003 --> 01:32:10.724]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:32:10.965 --> 01:32:12.526]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:32:12.686 --> 01:32:16.711]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:32:16.731 --> 01:32:19.293]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:21.576]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:32:21.756 --> 01:32:29.604]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:32:29.924 --> 01:32:33.028]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:32:33.168 --> 01:32:34.670]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:32:34.710 --> 01:32:37.593]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:32:37.753 --> 01:32:39.115]  Saved a ton of money there.
[01:32:39.395 --> 01:32:44.701]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[01:32:44.701 --> 01:32:45.581]  We're good to go.
[01:33:33.314 --> 01:33:35.618]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:35.938 --> 01:33:37.420]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:33:38.882 --> 01:33:41.006]  We are here, live, 11 a.m.
[01:33:41.066 --> 01:33:41.907]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:41.947 --> 01:33:42.448]  Central now.
[01:33:42.488 --> 01:33:43.309]  We've added an hour.
[01:33:44.351 --> 01:33:46.995]  And, of course, we have the nightly news, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[01:33:49.148 --> 01:33:58.216]  And as gloomy as some of what Dr. Roberts is talking about here, the good news is the world is waking up to the criminals that have basically occupied our government and taken it over.
[01:33:58.737 --> 01:34:04.022]  So I would say, in a way, the fact that the empire is in so much trouble is a positive thing.
[01:34:04.122 --> 01:34:08.486]  But looking at what's happening in the economy, how long can this QE go on?
[01:34:08.826 --> 01:34:10.528]  Dr. Roberts, what's the real state of the economy?
[01:34:11.650 --> 01:34:13.071]  Well, it's in a shambles.
[01:34:14.131 --> 01:34:15.812]  There's really no economy here.
[01:34:15.832 --> 01:34:17.213]  It hasn't been for some time.
[01:34:17.934 --> 01:34:19.454]  You know, we've talked about it so many times.
[01:34:19.534 --> 01:34:23.256]  First, they offshored all the well-paid manufacturing jobs.
[01:34:23.757 --> 01:34:34.483]  Then they offshored millions of the professional skill jobs, the kind that are exchangeable, like software engineering, information technology.
[01:34:35.063 --> 01:34:42.088]  So we now have had several classes come out of universities, graduates, and there's no employment for them.
[01:34:43.209 --> 01:34:44.770]  And they can't form households.
[01:34:45.523 --> 01:34:58.534]  And they go back and live in their childhood rooms at home, or they go to their grandparents, or they pool what little resources they have from being waitresses and bartenders and share rents.
[01:34:58.595 --> 01:35:05.300]  I mean, you know, you can't really have an economy if the young can't get a foot in.
[01:35:06.261 --> 01:35:08.843]  So, there's no economy here.
[01:35:09.103 --> 01:35:21.109]  It's really running on accumulated savings of the past, primarily those of the older generation, who are at the point where they have to help their children and their grandchildren.
[01:35:21.850 --> 01:35:23.431]  So, there's no economy here.
[01:35:23.911 --> 01:35:24.691]  There are no jobs.
[01:35:25.612 --> 01:35:31.976]  The jobs are increasingly part-time, low-paid, no benefits.
[01:35:33.639 --> 01:35:34.701]  It's the shambles.
[01:35:35.822 --> 01:35:39.187]  If you don't have good connections, you can't get a job.
[01:35:40.669 --> 01:35:44.652]  Not one that would permit you to form a household and have an independent existence.
[01:35:45.633 --> 01:35:46.754]  And we can see this, Alex.
[01:35:46.774 --> 01:35:54.300]  You know, you have now the situation where there are all these young women who can't pay their student loans.
[01:35:54.381 --> 01:35:59.225]  They can't pay their college tuition, their car payments, their rents.
[01:35:59.285 --> 01:36:03.868]  And they advertise themselves that they're available to older men who have resources.
[01:36:04.589 --> 01:36:06.811]  So this is a sign of a third world country.
[01:36:07.875 --> 01:36:12.178]  The United States is a failed state in every respect.
[01:36:13.139 --> 01:36:14.159]  In every respect.
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:25.687]  There's no strength here anywhere except in these, in whatever this deep government is that's destroying the Constitution and everybody's rights.
[01:36:25.927 --> 01:36:27.028]  There's no other strength.
[01:36:27.908 --> 01:36:31.051]  And so the whole thing can just collapse out from under them.
[01:36:33.532 --> 01:36:34.673]  There's no strength in the West.
[01:36:35.033 --> 01:36:36.034]  There's no strength in Europe.
[01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:40.260]  The strength is in Russia and China.
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:42.721]  It's only places in Australia.
[01:36:45.621 --> 01:36:48.262]  And so we will try to destabilize those countries.
[01:36:48.882 --> 01:36:54.243]  As I said earlier, I think Putin is due for an assassination attempt.
[01:36:56.583 --> 01:37:01.304]  And the United States now is discredited in the eyes of the world.
[01:37:02.524 --> 01:37:04.705]  It's discredited with its own vassals.
[01:37:04.905 --> 01:37:06.645]  I saw the other day that Australia,
[01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:08.582]  Total U.S.
[01:37:08.662 --> 01:37:09.403]  puppet state.
[01:37:10.063 --> 01:37:11.545]  Total puppet.
[01:37:11.565 --> 01:37:16.849]  It refused to participate in the American naval operations in the South China Sea.
[01:37:18.631 --> 01:37:24.256]  So people are looking at this and saying, well, this doesn't work for us anymore.
[01:37:25.817 --> 01:37:30.321]  We don't want to be drawn into a conflict with Russia and China.
[01:37:31.082 --> 01:37:33.044]  The United States is no match
[01:37:34.261 --> 01:37:36.541]  With a combination of Russia and China.
[01:37:37.062 --> 01:37:40.282]  No matter what Obama was bragging about at the U.N.
[01:37:40.602 --> 01:37:42.543]  We have the most powerful military.
[01:37:42.823 --> 01:37:44.683]  We have the most powerful economy.
[01:37:45.563 --> 01:37:46.543]  Balderdash.
[01:37:47.864 --> 01:38:02.447]  When Russia hit those Islamic State targets with those sea-launched cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea, that sent fear all up every European's spine.
[01:38:02.547 --> 01:38:03.927]  No one knew they had these weapons.
[01:38:06.107 --> 01:38:13.053]  With these types of weapons, an anti-ballistic missile defense is worthless, because it can't shoot down cruise missiles.
[01:38:14.414 --> 01:38:17.096]  Russia doesn't need ICBMs to take Europe out.
[01:38:17.937 --> 01:38:19.659]  Europeans know that.
[01:38:19.739 --> 01:38:21.300]  They have no protection whatsoever.
[01:38:22.421 --> 01:38:25.323]  If they're forced into conflict with Russia, they'll disappear instantly.
[01:38:26.264 --> 01:38:26.845]  They know that.
[01:38:28.066 --> 01:38:29.947]  So the whole thing has changed.
[01:38:30.708 --> 01:38:33.650]  I think the change came with Obama's speech,
[01:38:34.781 --> 01:38:37.763]  On the 28th of September, he said, we've had it with you.
[01:38:37.803 --> 01:38:38.444]  That's it.
[01:38:39.004 --> 01:38:42.126]  Two days later, as I said, he's taken over the war in Syria.
[01:38:42.806 --> 01:38:43.727]  What can we do about it?
[01:38:43.907 --> 01:38:44.267]  Nothing.
[01:38:45.568 --> 01:38:46.329]  Push the button.
[01:38:49.791 --> 01:38:52.773]  So I think the economy here is, there's no economy.
[01:38:52.833 --> 01:38:53.774]  It's not coming back.
[01:38:54.634 --> 01:38:56.936]  It's probably going to go down further.
[01:38:59.710 --> 01:39:07.813]  Something sharp could happen in which the whole thing just implodes, you know, like a controlled demolition of a building.
[01:39:08.694 --> 01:39:24.680]  Or it could just be a long, slow, drawn-out process where all the savings in the system are drawn out and people become progressively poorer year by year except for the 1%, which sits there accumulating whatever surplus is left in the system.
[01:39:25.361 --> 01:39:26.301]  This doesn't work!
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:28.221]  It doesn't work.
[01:39:28.841 --> 01:39:29.582]  It can't work.
[01:39:31.043 --> 01:39:31.784]  It's ignored.
[01:39:31.884 --> 01:39:33.965]  All the real problems are ignored.
[01:39:36.167 --> 01:39:37.428]  And so they're not addressed.
[01:39:37.468 --> 01:39:39.550]  If they're not addressed, they can't be fixed.
[01:39:40.231 --> 01:39:41.812]  They fester.
[01:39:42.553 --> 01:39:43.353]  They get worse.
[01:39:43.634 --> 01:39:44.755]  And they blow up.
[01:39:45.035 --> 01:39:47.297]  And the system breaks down.
[01:39:48.178 --> 01:39:51.941]  I think that that is the most accurate forecast.
[01:39:53.132 --> 01:39:53.853]  What's going to happen?
[01:39:53.913 --> 01:39:56.934]  In the meantime, yes, they may oppress all of us who speak out.
[01:39:57.215 --> 01:39:58.075]  They may well do that.
[01:39:58.135 --> 01:40:01.097]  You know, it's always been the tendency to shoot the messenger.
[01:40:02.798 --> 01:40:03.678]  Shoot the messenger.
[01:40:04.159 --> 01:40:04.899]  You're a messenger.
[01:40:04.999 --> 01:40:05.780]  I'm a messenger.
[01:40:07.421 --> 01:40:07.881]  Shoot them.
[01:40:08.241 --> 01:40:11.023]  And they've got the power to do that.
[01:40:11.303 --> 01:40:11.583]  Yes.
[01:40:13.704 --> 01:40:15.105]  But these are the risks you take.
[01:40:16.066 --> 01:40:17.707]  They can shoot you wherever you are.
[01:40:20.788 --> 01:40:21.509]  Where can you go?
[01:40:21.529 --> 01:40:28.638]  In fact, the way that the Americans are becoming hated all over the world, you're not safe anywhere.
[01:40:28.778 --> 01:40:29.899]  The people there will kill you.
[01:40:31.642 --> 01:40:32.282]  Where can you go?
[01:40:32.543 --> 01:40:34.565]  You can go to Russia if you learn the language.
[01:40:36.468 --> 01:40:38.050]  Probably you'd be safe there.
[01:40:39.397 --> 01:40:40.537]  But not necessarily.
[01:40:41.098 --> 01:40:44.599]  The CIA may send one of these checking terrorists after you.
[01:40:45.619 --> 01:40:48.800]  I mean, you know, Americans aren't safe anywhere.
[01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:52.241]  It's not just not safe in your own government.
[01:40:52.281 --> 01:40:55.882]  But you know, if the CIA wants to get you, it's easier for them to kill you in Mexico than here.
[01:40:56.683 --> 01:40:57.123]  That's right.
[01:40:57.963 --> 01:41:06.686]  So, you know, the notion of getting out and getting away, you know, you can shut up and make an apology.
[01:41:07.919 --> 01:41:09.520]  Other than that, you're in it.
[01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:10.561]  Oh, I know.
[01:41:10.661 --> 01:41:11.921]  I mean, I'm in it and I'm never leaving.
[01:41:11.941 --> 01:41:13.082]  I was just bemoaning.
[01:41:13.622 --> 01:41:15.403]  Just remember that statement, you know.
[01:41:15.423 --> 01:41:17.625]  A coward dies many times.
[01:41:17.665 --> 01:41:19.206]  A brave man dies but once.
[01:41:19.886 --> 01:41:23.008]  That's a much better way to go.
[01:41:23.028 --> 01:41:26.850]  Oh, I totally agree and I've... I pledge to stay here.
[01:41:27.230 --> 01:41:28.071]  Don't worry about it.
[01:41:28.191 --> 01:41:28.831]  We're in a fight.
[01:41:29.111 --> 01:41:33.514]  Look, if you're in a war, you're going to be killed any minute.
[01:41:34.471 --> 01:41:36.532]  And you don't say, well, damn, I might be killed.
[01:41:36.572 --> 01:41:37.453]  I think I'll go home.
[01:41:38.874 --> 01:41:41.236]  That's my view.
[01:41:41.316 --> 01:41:44.758]  So I think you need to keep telling people you don't need to exaggerate.
[01:41:45.319 --> 01:41:47.720]  You don't need to go beyond the evidence.
[01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:49.562]  You don't need to go up the wall.
[01:41:49.622 --> 01:41:49.982]  You can just
[01:41:51.206 --> 01:41:56.469]  Tell them the facts of what's going on and just come back to the two points I made.
[01:41:56.509 --> 01:41:57.350]  Look what Bush did.
[01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:58.370]  Look what Obama did.
[01:41:58.530 --> 01:42:01.792]  We can put you in definite detention despite the Constitution.
[01:42:01.832 --> 01:42:03.674]  We can murder you despite the Constitution.
[01:42:04.194 --> 01:42:06.095]  If you can do that, that's a police state.
[01:42:07.556 --> 01:42:08.596]  Putin can't do that.
[01:42:08.677 --> 01:42:10.758]  They can't even do that in China!
[01:42:13.246 --> 01:42:14.927]  Everybody is subject to law.
[01:42:15.228 --> 01:42:16.989]  But us, we've lost the protection of law.
[01:42:17.009 --> 01:42:20.272]  You know, that's the book I wrote those years ago, The Tyranny of Good Intentions.
[01:42:21.033 --> 01:42:23.154]  The title was, How the Law was Lost.
[01:42:24.035 --> 01:42:25.717]  And the publisher changed it.
[01:42:27.238 --> 01:42:29.300]  But we don't have the protection of law.
[01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:35.825]  And this began before 9-11, before the wars, before Obama and Bush.
[01:42:37.146 --> 01:42:40.109]  So if you don't have protection of law, you don't have nothing.
[01:42:41.018 --> 01:42:42.358]  This is the fact.
[01:42:43.139 --> 01:42:49.321]  And by the way, my latest book is The Neoconservative Threat to World Order.
[01:42:50.441 --> 01:42:51.281]  That's the latest book.
[01:42:51.321 --> 01:42:51.962]  It's just out.
[01:42:52.302 --> 01:42:54.742]  Well, we need to have you back to talk about that book then.
[01:42:55.043 --> 01:42:59.364]  Briefly, I guess it just breaks down that the neocons are still in control, or?
[01:43:00.504 --> 01:43:02.225]  Well, they may not be.
[01:43:02.305 --> 01:43:05.246]  I noticed one thing recently that's optimistic.
[01:43:06.374 --> 01:43:12.815]  Obama was interviewed on 60 Minutes by some neocon or somebody whose mindset is neocon.
[01:43:13.375 --> 01:43:18.356]  And the guy was trying to push him into taking aggressive action in Syria.
[01:43:19.316 --> 01:43:24.157]  And Obama at the very end said, look, what do you want us to do?
[01:43:24.277 --> 01:43:26.798]  Repeat all the mistakes we've already made?
[01:43:26.978 --> 01:43:28.678]  More troops in Syria?
[01:43:28.718 --> 01:43:29.838]  More back to Iraq?
[01:43:29.958 --> 01:43:30.979]  Troops in Libya?
[01:43:31.199 --> 01:43:32.059]  Troops in Yemen?
[01:43:33.083 --> 01:43:38.207]  He said it would be a shame if we can't learn from our mistakes and not repeat them.
[01:43:39.468 --> 01:43:51.778]  Now that shows that he finally realizes after seven years he's been a tool of a neocon agenda that he said has not served the national interest of the United States.
[01:43:52.955 --> 01:43:53.796]  I wrote about this.
[01:43:54.236 --> 01:43:59.059]  Go look at the interview, just the Syria part of the interview on 60 Minutes.
[01:43:59.079 --> 01:43:59.959]  It was very recent.
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:02.381]  I forget the guy's name.
[01:44:02.401 --> 01:44:03.461]  It was two weeks ago.
[01:44:04.082 --> 01:44:06.343]  Yeah, and I wrote about it just recently.
[01:44:06.803 --> 01:44:09.125]  And just go look at that interview toward the very end.
[01:44:09.525 --> 01:44:11.466]  This guy keeps trying to push Obama.
[01:44:11.706 --> 01:44:14.348]  It's all your fault the Russians are in Syria.
[01:44:14.388 --> 01:44:15.589]  You were weak.
[01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:17.690]  You wouldn't intervene hard enough.
[01:44:19.351 --> 01:44:20.672]  It's just like a neocon.
[01:44:21.564 --> 01:44:27.810]  Pushing him, and Obama says, no, we've made those mistakes, not anymore.
[01:44:28.571 --> 01:44:37.160]  Now, I think, and I wrote, I said, this is an amazing thing, because it's a very lonely and dangerous position for Obama to take.
[01:44:39.502 --> 01:44:40.823]  So, what does it mean?
[01:44:41.183 --> 01:44:45.966]  You know, the President is always... People exaggerate the independence of a President.
[01:44:46.327 --> 01:44:49.609]  They don't have anything like the independence people think.
[01:44:49.729 --> 01:44:52.090]  I know I've worked for the President.
[01:44:52.451 --> 01:44:55.453]  I know how little independence even Reagan had.
[01:44:56.714 --> 01:44:59.575]  Obama hasn't any, and yet he made this statement.
[01:45:00.056 --> 01:45:07.561]  So, it tells me he's realized that he's been used for seven years, handed scripts, handed decisions,
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:10.601]  And they failed.
[01:45:11.842 --> 01:45:20.529]  Just go read it and see if that exactly says, in the very end of the serious section, or just go straight to my column, which will reference it.
[01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:24.272]  And that's at drpaulcraigroberts.org, or paulcraigroberts.org.
[01:45:24.693 --> 01:45:33.320]  Alright, well very informative, and I guess it's good news in the bad news, but overall I can see it on the streets, people are waking up, or they're just getting stupider.
[01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:37.903]  Alex, remember, people will fight and resist if they think there's hope.
[01:45:38.945 --> 01:45:40.627]  So don't take away all the hope.
[01:45:41.007 --> 01:45:42.068]  Tell them what's going on.
[01:45:42.468 --> 01:45:43.069]  Encourage them.
[01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:45.071]  Oh, I totally agree.
[01:45:45.091 --> 01:45:46.172]  I totally agree with you.
[01:45:46.572 --> 01:45:51.657]  But at the same time, I think people... I'll come back, but I can't really ever do much more than 30 minutes.
[01:45:51.737 --> 01:45:52.418]  It's just hard.
[01:45:52.859 --> 01:45:53.299]  I understand.
[01:45:53.319 --> 01:45:54.860]  All right, we'll talk to you again very soon.
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:56.862]  Congratulations on the new book and thank you for joining us.
[01:45:58.144 --> 01:45:58.404]  Good.
[01:45:58.484 --> 01:46:00.846]  It's always good to talk to you, Alex, and all the best to you.
[01:46:00.986 --> 01:46:01.387]  Thanks a lot.
[01:46:02.834 --> 01:46:07.776]  There goes Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, smart guy, and he's been really pessimistic in the past.
[01:46:07.836 --> 01:46:09.197]  He seems more positive now.
[01:46:09.557 --> 01:46:13.599]  And I want to be clear, I'm not trying to be doom and gloom here.
[01:46:14.819 --> 01:46:16.460]  And I really don't exaggerate.
[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:20.122]  What I find is, nine times out of ten I don't.
[01:46:21.282 --> 01:46:25.904]  Sometimes I do, but when I go back and really listen to shows and things, I usually underestimate.
[01:46:26.605 --> 01:46:31.247]  And I think that's all of our blind spot, is that people don't realize when they're facing real tyranny.
[01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:36.773]  The world still didn't know what Hitler was up to in 1939.
[01:46:36.813 --> 01:46:42.959]  There were debates in Newsweek Magazine or Time Magazine whether he was a good guy or a bad guy.
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:45.040]  Time Life Books.
[01:46:46.682 --> 01:46:51.025]  Folks were debating whether the Communists were good when Stalin was in power and already killed tens of millions.
[01:46:53.928 --> 01:46:55.969]  Folks weren't saying Mao was a mass murderer until the 70s.
[01:47:02.133 --> 01:47:11.505]  I mean, a lot of the conservatives were calling it Red China and criticizing it, knew what was going on, but we just have to admit how corrupt things have gotten.
[01:47:12.647 --> 01:47:18.014]  And they are starting to go after and indict senators and congressmen and women and governors.
[01:47:22.366 --> 01:47:25.547]  We're gonna go to break, get Joe Biggs to pop in briefly at the Hillary event.
[01:47:25.567 --> 01:47:27.168]  I don't see if there's new developments there.
[01:47:27.188 --> 01:47:28.068]  I'm sure there has been.
[01:47:28.328 --> 01:47:29.209]  He's gotten into the event.
[01:47:29.649 --> 01:47:31.229]  She's scheduled to be there in the next 15 minutes.
[01:47:31.689 --> 01:47:33.230]  We'll check in again with him in the next hour.
[01:47:38.052 --> 01:47:43.454]  But, you know, when Roberts, I'm gonna get in an argument with him, he's a smart guy, but he's like, the UN's not taking over, that's our puppet.
[01:47:43.854 --> 01:47:44.594]  I get all that.
[01:47:46.515 --> 01:47:49.436]  But it's international law being adopted.
[01:47:51.721 --> 01:47:53.542]  Just like the gun treaty.
[01:47:53.702 --> 01:48:00.665]  They use that to come in and basically apply it because of treaties we've already signed, just like TPP.
[01:48:02.066 --> 01:48:03.527]  So there is a method to this.
[01:48:03.627 --> 01:48:06.208]  America's meant to be brought down into the global system.
[01:48:07.849 --> 01:48:12.131]  Roberts just comes from a group of people that actually weren't perfect, but wanted to build the country up.
[01:48:12.471 --> 01:48:15.713]  So for them, it's just really disgusting.
[01:48:17.233 --> 01:48:17.854]  And I get that.
[01:48:19.955 --> 01:48:20.155]  But
[01:48:21.417 --> 01:48:25.362]  We've got to admit how horrible it is to be able to get out of it.
[01:48:25.442 --> 01:48:29.346]  That's what's optimistic, is to admit that we're overrun.
[01:48:31.409 --> 01:48:34.032]  And to really break with the people that run Washington.
[01:48:34.052 --> 01:48:37.917]  I mean, you've got to understand, folks, that this isn't debatable.
[01:48:39.158 --> 01:48:40.039]  That this is going on.
[01:48:40.359 --> 01:48:41.321]  As he said, it is a fact.
[01:48:42.401 --> 01:48:49.063]  But I think it's good to be emotional about it and aggressive about it because that's how you get people out of their trance.
[01:48:49.223 --> 01:48:50.724]  And I am physically upset.
[01:48:50.744 --> 01:49:04.308]  You know, when I say I instinctively want to evacuate the country, I could move out of the country and the globals would probably never even come after me.
[01:49:05.148 --> 01:49:06.848]  Or I could go to New Zealand, whatever.
[01:49:07.329 --> 01:49:08.309]  I'm never going to do that.
[01:49:09.662 --> 01:49:10.883]  It's funny, Robert's giving me a pep talk.
[01:49:10.923 --> 01:49:11.363]  Don't leave.
[01:49:11.963 --> 01:49:12.403]  Be positive.
[01:49:12.423 --> 01:49:13.104]  You're doing a good job.
[01:49:13.764 --> 01:49:14.544]  I'm not saying that.
[01:49:15.125 --> 01:49:23.649]  It's here watching the country be strangled in front of me and knowing that I'm in the crosshairs is a disgusting feeling is what I'm saying.
[01:49:24.009 --> 01:49:33.094]  And in my flesh, in my gut, I just don't want to be in the middle of it.
[01:49:33.454 --> 01:49:34.615]  But I am and I'm not leaving.
[01:49:35.255 --> 01:49:36.476]  But still I have that thought.
[01:49:37.056 --> 01:49:39.077]  I'd be a liar if I didn't say I wasn't having that thought.
[01:49:40.717 --> 01:49:45.718]  By the way, Super Mill Vitality, our number one flagship product of concentrated herbs and compounds.
[01:49:46.812 --> 01:49:47.773]  It's now back in.

[01:49:48.913 --> 01:49:51.054]  People have been chomping at the bit to get it.
[01:49:51.215 --> 01:49:52.115]  It is back in.
[01:49:52.135 --> 01:49:56.317]  It's been sold out for over a month, but now we can say that it is back in stock.
[01:49:56.337 --> 01:49:57.178]  The truck gets here Monday.

[01:50:51.701 --> 01:50:52.783]  Is the general shopping cart.
[01:50:52.843 --> 01:50:56.188]  M4WarsLife.com is the subsection of the Nutraceuticals.
[01:50:56.889 --> 01:51:00.595]  M4WarsSelect.com takes you right to the storable foods area.

[01:51:02.798 --> 01:51:03.519]  It's the same thing.
[01:51:03.539 --> 01:51:04.901]  It's just private label by us.
[01:51:04.941 --> 01:51:05.983]  We can offer lower prices.
[01:51:06.383 --> 01:51:07.325]  M4WarsLife.com
[01:51:08.354 --> 01:51:11.715]  You wouldn't go camping in the Everglades without bug spray, would you?
[01:51:12.335 --> 01:51:16.997]  It's in our nature to protect ourselves, especially when protection is simple and affordable.
[01:51:17.357 --> 01:51:23.219]  That's why IDStronghold.com has been providing affordable RFID protection for over 10 years.
[01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:32.923]  IDStronghold wallets protect you from electronic pickpockets who pass near you with scanners and steal the information on the RFID chips in your credit and debit cards.
[01:51:33.343 --> 01:51:39.924]  IDStronghold.com is a technology company, so we understand how to best protect you against intrusive radio waves.
[01:51:40.465 --> 01:51:47.306]  IDStronghold wallets are designed to block RFID signals, opened or closed, no matter where in the wallet you put your cards.
[01:51:47.746 --> 01:51:53.948]  Most other RFID wallets on the market were designed with only fashion in mind and do not shield properly, if at all.
[01:51:54.408 --> 01:52:00.369]  When you're shopping for your next wallet, be sure to get the protection you deserve by going to IDStronghold.com.
[01:52:00.809 --> 01:52:05.097]  Because getting anything else is like using latex gloves as oven mitts.
[01:52:06.981 --> 01:52:07.201]  Ouch!
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:17.304]  Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day and the home security industry wants you to believe that's your only option.
[01:52:17.564 --> 01:52:22.747]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[01:52:23.047 --> 01:52:27.649]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[01:52:27.949 --> 01:52:31.171]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.
[01:52:31.451 --> 01:52:33.532]  But there's a better way to protect your home.
[01:52:33.892 --> 01:52:35.453]  SimpliSafe Home Security.

[01:53:07.895 --> 01:53:08.775]  Hey, Berky Guy here.
[01:53:08.855 --> 01:53:10.576]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[01:53:10.696 --> 01:53:12.397]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[01:53:12.457 --> 01:53:14.297]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?
[01:53:14.417 --> 01:53:20.299]  The Berky Guy is here to help you remove these and other potential contaminants from your water, thus helping you drink clean, purified water.

[01:53:32.403 --> 01:53:32.583]  That's 877-886-3653.
[01:53:37.685 --> 01:53:41.227]  Just recently, we've witnessed some of the most catastrophic disasters in history.
[01:53:41.507 --> 01:53:47.589]  Be sure to prepare yourself with great-tasting, high-quality, GMO-free food that has a 25-year shelf life.
[01:53:48.130 --> 01:53:51.491]  Of course, we're talking about the foods from SurvivalFoodAlliance.com.
[01:53:51.951 --> 01:53:57.494]  And don't forget, the human body needs up to 3 quarts of water every day to remain healthy and hydrated.
[01:53:57.954 --> 01:54:01.116]  So check out our water bricks at SurvivalFoodAlliance.com.
[01:54:01.516 --> 01:54:03.737]  Go to SurvivalFoodAlliance.com or call 877-223-1776.
[01:54:17.434 --> 01:54:30.164]  I've covered some very important news today, but I haven't gotten into the meat of general news, and we've moved our other guests so I would have more time to cover news in the next hour.
[01:54:30.184 --> 01:54:35.389]  These are some of the headlines up on Infowars.com.
[01:54:36.249 --> 01:54:43.275]  Just showing how you're not taught reading, writing, arithmetic, how to start a business, how to be charming, how to be successful, how to engage people.
[01:54:43.515 --> 01:54:45.337]  They're ending culture as we know it.
[01:54:46.397 --> 01:54:53.841]  And they've got former linguistics professors, they've got former psyops officers all going public saying this is weapon.
[01:54:54.282 --> 01:54:55.482]  This is a weaponized system.
[01:54:55.502 --> 01:54:57.323]  I mean, that's what it is.
[01:54:58.964 --> 01:55:00.945]  It sounds sensational, but that's what it is.
[01:55:03.167 --> 01:55:08.590]  And folks from earlier generations that didn't grow up in total mind control are pretty much blind to it.
[01:55:08.630 --> 01:55:10.511]  They just seem silly and dumb.
[01:55:12.435 --> 01:55:17.877]  But to the young people that have basically phobia, panic attacks, agoraphobia.
[01:55:20.479 --> 01:55:26.301]  If they hear the word black or white or if they see a brown bag, they've just been turned into mental patients.
[01:55:28.102 --> 01:55:29.362]  CNN opinion piece.
[01:55:29.623 --> 01:55:30.503]  This is CNN.
[01:55:30.543 --> 01:55:32.384]  See, this isn't just some crazy professor.
[01:55:33.664 --> 01:55:35.865]  Shame people for saying he and she.
[01:55:36.906 --> 01:55:39.347]  See, first don't say the n-word, now don't say he and she.
[01:55:41.564 --> 01:55:42.044]  Here's another one.
[01:55:42.104 --> 01:55:45.768]  Mass panic at Texas school after student says, gum.
[01:55:47.529 --> 01:55:49.591]  Because gum sounded like gun.
[01:55:53.995 --> 01:55:55.356]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:55:57.578 --> 01:55:59.780]  People indicted for having rebel flags at a park.
[01:56:01.601 --> 01:56:02.062]  In Georgia.
[01:56:02.862 --> 01:56:03.443]  The state flag.
[01:56:09.349 --> 01:56:14.254]  Germans arrested and their children taken if they post on Facebook that the border shouldn't be open.
[01:56:14.614 --> 01:56:15.455]  That's happening.
[01:56:15.735 --> 01:56:16.055]  You understand?
[01:56:16.456 --> 01:56:17.937]  I can't believe I'm saying this.
[01:56:18.938 --> 01:56:26.665]  And like Robert said, they start with some goobers in four-wheel trucks, and then they move on to you next.
[01:56:28.027 --> 01:56:29.088]  And they mean business.
[01:56:31.547 --> 01:56:34.488]  We haven't gotten to Trump calling Sanders a maniac communist.
[01:56:34.528 --> 01:56:35.289]  That's what he is.
[01:56:35.329 --> 01:56:41.351]  He's just a total buffoon with class-envy talking points.
[01:56:41.391 --> 01:56:42.372]  Makes you want to throw up.
[01:56:44.132 --> 01:56:49.075]  Oath keepers to form college chapters to stop students from cooperating in their own murders.
[01:56:49.115 --> 01:56:58.078]  I was talking to a UT law professor last night at dinner and he was talking about this guy that quit at UT.
[01:56:58.819 --> 01:56:59.439]  Total stunt!
[01:57:01.852 --> 01:57:02.853]  You know, this professor quit.
[01:57:03.134 --> 01:57:06.619]  He was teaching one class the last five years, and he was already going to retire this year.
[01:57:06.839 --> 01:57:07.380]  He knows him.
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:09.883]  It was a total staged event.
[01:57:09.923 --> 01:57:11.205]  Professor quits because of guns.
[01:57:11.466 --> 01:57:12.747]  The guns were already on campus.
[01:57:13.936 --> 01:57:15.317]  The state law is already in place.
[01:57:15.717 --> 01:57:17.299]  Now it just says inside school buildings.
[01:57:17.799 --> 01:57:21.682]  As if a criminal wouldn't come in there and shoot people anyways if they were going to break the law.
[01:57:22.003 --> 01:57:25.265]  Oh, I'm going to kill people, but I'm not going to break the law and carry a gun on campus.
[01:57:25.325 --> 01:57:26.887]  It's just, it's just, they know it.
[01:57:27.307 --> 01:57:28.528]  These aren't illogical people.
[01:57:28.588 --> 01:57:32.671]  It's all stunts by a bunch of would-be ruling class people.
[01:57:33.252 --> 01:57:34.493]  They're the ultimate statist.
[01:57:35.474 --> 01:57:36.454]  They're the ultimate evil.
[01:57:36.855 --> 01:57:37.195]  They are.
[01:57:38.296 --> 01:57:41.358]  Joe Biggs, we're going to have you on the next segment with us, but what's happened so far?
[01:57:41.439 --> 01:57:42.960]  Has the Supreme Leader arrived yet?
[01:57:43.854 --> 01:57:46.016]  Yeah, they actually just brought her out on stage.
[01:57:46.296 --> 01:57:47.717]  Castro's speaking right now.
[01:57:48.718 --> 01:57:49.999]  She's off to the rights.
[01:57:50.559 --> 01:57:51.300]  Yeah, basically.
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:52.260]  It was funny.
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:53.721]  Let's walk over here real quick.
[01:57:53.741 --> 01:58:02.648]  There's a lady out here screaming that Hillary kills babies and that we have a better chance of having El Chapo as president than Hillary Clinton.
[01:58:02.668 --> 01:58:05.110]  I couldn't agree much more than that.
[01:58:05.850 --> 01:58:10.654]  So there's a whole lot of people out here, as you can see, that have the Hillary for prison sign.
[01:58:10.794 --> 01:58:13.076]  So that's a free speech zone or is that people at the fence?
[01:58:13.962 --> 01:58:14.965]  That's people on the outside.
[01:58:14.985 --> 01:58:16.890]  They're not allowed to be on the inside because they disagree.
[01:58:17.597 --> 01:58:21.538]  I tell you what, we're going to go to break, but we're going to keep your feet up and come right back to you in 70 seconds.
[01:58:21.598 --> 01:58:36.561]  Let's aim the camera during the break at her lordship, get a shot of her, then we're going to go over to the next segment and talk to the humans that are against this enemy of life, this goblin creature, the Wicked Witch of the East, whatever you want to call her.
[01:58:37.481 --> 01:58:43.123]  I'm sorry, I guess Lord and Savior of its Democrat supporter is how they see Hillary.
[01:58:43.163 --> 01:58:44.263]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.

[02:00:14.079 --> 02:00:18.281]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:18.922 --> 02:00:19.722]  You want answers?
[02:00:20.503 --> 02:00:21.423]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.043 --> 02:00:25.665]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.246 --> 02:00:30.188]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.308 --> 02:00:34.871]  Alright, Joe Biggs is inside the city center there, but they've got
[02:00:35.891 --> 02:00:36.692]  It finched off.
[02:00:36.752 --> 02:00:39.935]  There are, it looks like, hundreds of people outside protesting against the Lord and Savior.
[02:00:40.315 --> 02:00:40.875]  Hillary Clinton.
[02:00:40.915 --> 02:00:46.400]  Joe Biggs is about to walk over to talk to the Info Warriors and folks with signs saying Hillary for prison.
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:49.703]  I got a sneaking suspicion that's a bunch of Info Warriors out there.
[02:00:50.023 --> 02:00:50.864]  Joe Biggs, take over.
[02:00:50.884 --> 02:00:57.930]  Alright, yeah, so we're out here once again at the Sunset Station here in downtown San Antonio.
[02:00:57.950 --> 02:01:02.914]  Castro is up there talking right now to his wife.
[02:01:03.567 --> 02:01:05.508]  Hillary, uh, Stalin, Clinton.
[02:01:06.568 --> 02:01:09.669]  I mean, you guys have been showing the pictures of these posters.
[02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:11.130]  I mean, it really just makes you disturbed.
[02:01:11.710 --> 02:01:12.891]  Your stomach hurts just seeing that.
[02:01:12.911 --> 02:01:14.371]  Well, let's go talk to those patriots, Joe.
[02:01:14.391 --> 02:01:16.252]  Well, it's funny.
[02:01:16.272 --> 02:01:21.234]  They just said that Castro announced Hillary and said that she has the ultimate plan for immigration.
[02:01:21.874 --> 02:01:23.215]  I thought that was pretty funny.
[02:01:23.975 --> 02:01:25.516]  So as you can hear over here, there's people booing.
[02:01:25.536 --> 02:01:30.478]  There's folks with Hillary for prison signs.
[02:01:30.558 --> 02:01:30.918]  I love it.
[02:01:38.789 --> 02:01:40.870]  Headlines, San Antonioans boo Hillary.
[02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:42.311]  Hundreds boo Hillary in San Antonio.
[02:01:42.451 --> 02:01:43.112]  Look at this guy!
[02:01:43.452 --> 02:01:45.013]  What are you here for?
[02:01:45.293 --> 02:01:46.574]  Hillary for prison, man.
[02:01:46.634 --> 02:01:49.896]  I want to tell... Stop Congo genocide!
[02:01:50.596 --> 02:01:52.357]  Stop Congo genocide!
[02:01:52.697 --> 02:01:54.118]  Stop Congo genocide!
[02:01:54.138 --> 02:01:56.039]  Stop Congo genocide!
[02:01:56.139 --> 02:01:57.460]  Stop Congo genocide!
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:00.042]  Stop Congo genocide!
[02:02:05.526 --> 02:02:09.467]  These are folks that want Hillary to do something in Africa.
[02:02:09.487 --> 02:02:12.128]  I see a Hillary for Prison 2016 sign.
[02:02:12.828 --> 02:02:15.709]  How many folks would you say there, Joe?
[02:02:16.829 --> 02:02:18.490]  A couple hundred up and down the fence.
[02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:20.851]  The one says, when her husband lied, no one died.
[02:02:20.871 --> 02:02:24.492]  Good Lord, these are some gruesome photos.
[02:02:24.992 --> 02:02:26.112]  What's happening in the Congo.
[02:02:29.253 --> 02:02:30.694]  Hillary equals scandal.
[02:02:31.034 --> 02:02:32.434]  Well, there are a lot of Hillary for Prison.
[02:02:32.474 --> 02:02:34.315]  Infowars.com sign, I see that.
[02:02:35.529 --> 02:02:39.910]  Hey, see if you can get that fellow at TheInfoWars.com, Hillary from prison, to come talk to you.
[02:02:40.651 --> 02:02:44.732]  Hey Alex, just wanted to say hello and America, I need to wake up.
[02:02:45.192 --> 02:02:46.353]  Oh hey, how you doing man?
[02:02:46.773 --> 02:02:53.775]  To all the lies and all the scandals that are happening, that have continued to happen, and will not stop to happen.
[02:02:54.355 --> 02:02:55.216]  That's Mario Lopez.
[02:02:55.256 --> 02:02:56.256]  Where should Hillary go?
[02:02:56.276 --> 02:02:57.436]  To the White House or to prison?
[02:02:57.616 --> 02:02:58.217]  To prison.
[02:02:58.237 --> 02:02:59.477]  Thank you.
[02:02:59.777 --> 02:03:01.278]  Hey, say hi to Mario Lopez, call him back.
[02:03:02.378 --> 02:03:04.539]  That's a vet we interviewed, he's also an artist.
[02:03:05.512 --> 02:03:06.493]  He's got a bionic arm.
[02:03:06.513 --> 02:03:09.675]  Oh, he's done, he's done.
[02:03:09.695 --> 02:03:10.055]  He's done.
[02:03:10.135 --> 02:03:11.736]  It's so loud, I don't think you can hear anything.
[02:03:11.756 --> 02:03:13.417]  There's a lot of other listeners out there.
[02:03:13.457 --> 02:03:14.698]  Well, good job listeners being out there.
[02:03:14.938 --> 02:03:16.179]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:03:16.199 --> 02:03:19.180]  So, a lot of people are screaming.
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:21.742]  There's some new custom-made Hillary for prison.
[02:03:23.663 --> 02:03:27.686]  Joe, I think it might be time for you to take your shirt off and let everybody see what you're really wearing.
[02:03:28.046 --> 02:03:29.087]  See how long they leave you in there.
[02:03:29.987 --> 02:03:30.888]  Okay.
[02:03:31.128 --> 02:03:32.048]  You think they'll let you stay?
[02:03:32.068 --> 02:03:34.210]  Uh, we'll see.
[02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:36.281]  Do you think this is the right time?
[02:03:39.423 --> 02:03:43.625]  He is removing the Stalin-Hillary shirt for radio listeners.
[02:03:45.206 --> 02:03:48.228]  And I guess it's a little hot out there and he's got a shirt on under it.
[02:03:48.248 --> 02:03:51.590]  And there it is, ladies and gentlemen, Hillary for prison!
[02:04:00.215 --> 02:04:03.897]  But his name tag is over the prison part, so we'll see once they see that.
[02:04:06.124 --> 02:04:07.645]  Alright.
[02:04:07.665 --> 02:04:09.165]  So here's this, going for prison.
[02:04:10.786 --> 02:04:12.186]  Inside the Hillary nest.
[02:04:12.787 --> 02:04:15.047]  Oh look, some of the Hillary morons are coming over.
[02:04:16.488 --> 02:04:17.909]  I'm surprised they're even bipedaled.
[02:04:18.009 --> 02:04:18.569]  Hand that way.
[02:04:18.609 --> 02:04:19.069]  Hand that way.
[02:04:19.169 --> 02:04:21.230]  Come on.
[02:04:21.250 --> 02:04:22.570]  Yeah, they're all starting to line up around me.
[02:04:23.111 --> 02:04:24.011]  Oh, the cops?
[02:04:24.651 --> 02:04:24.891]  Yeah.
[02:04:25.772 --> 02:04:28.313]  Because it's so scary that you took a shirt off?
[02:04:28.353 --> 02:04:29.493]  I mean, it's hot out there.
[02:04:29.513 --> 02:04:31.354]  Yeah, it's hot out there.
[02:04:32.314 --> 02:04:34.735]  It's sure as hell going to be hot in prison too when she goes.
[02:04:36.328 --> 02:04:36.971]  Let's walk around.
[02:04:37.433 --> 02:04:39.120]  Walk over to the cop, tell him hi.
[02:04:43.024 --> 02:04:44.225]  All right, we'll see what happens.
[02:04:44.245 --> 02:04:46.366]  We're going to keep the feed up for this one minute or three minutes.
[02:04:46.447 --> 02:04:47.527]  We're going to be back, Joe.
[02:04:47.547 --> 02:04:48.288]  Stay right there.
[02:04:49.008 --> 02:04:50.449]  Try not to get thrown out until we come back.
[02:04:50.970 --> 02:04:51.650]  Back in three minutes.
[02:04:51.670 --> 02:04:52.791]  We'll keep the feed live.
[02:04:53.351 --> 02:04:55.853]  Infowars.com forward slash show of your radio listener.
[02:04:56.254 --> 02:04:57.695]  You can go there and pick all this up.
[02:04:58.235 --> 02:04:59.076]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:59.136 --> 02:05:06.441]  This is the tip of the spear of the InfoWar, as we desperately attempt to rally humanity against the eugenicist forces of globalism.
[02:05:08.635 --> 02:05:17.503]  In yet another land grab, the BLM, the Bureau of Land Management, is ignoring the real estate title given by the state of Texas 74 years ago to a farmer.
[02:05:18.023 --> 02:05:28.153]  Now the same bureaucracy that has ignored property rights for ranchers like Cliven Bundy in Nevada, ignored property rights for miners in Oregon and elsewhere, is coming after the property of a Texas farmer.
[02:05:28.413 --> 02:05:32.536]  The BLM has decided they will move the boundary, take half his land and his house.
[02:05:33.237 --> 02:05:35.619]  Congress has allowed bureaucracies to grow unchecked.
[02:05:35.959 --> 02:05:45.185]  Because Congress doesn't like to pass laws, they have abdicated their constitutional duty to bureaucracies, who not only write the law, but often act as their own police force and run their own court.
[02:05:45.805 --> 02:05:48.467]  No one in either party in Washington wants to change it.
[02:05:49.248 --> 02:06:01.836]  These bureaucracies will destroy every last remnant of your God-given, constitutionally protected rights, including your property rights, unless they are stopped by you, by the people, at the state and the local level.
[02:06:03.393 --> 02:06:05.284]  For more information, go to n4wars.com.

[02:06:07.833 --> 02:06:11.055]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:06:11.355 --> 02:06:19.360]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:24.624]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:06:25.004 --> 02:06:27.305]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:06:46.022 --> 02:06:49.203]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:06:49.323 --> 02:06:52.544]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:06:52.804 --> 02:06:54.625]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:06:54.785 --> 02:06:56.665]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.

[02:07:07.509 --> 02:07:08.890]  I want more candy!
[02:07:08.910 --> 02:07:09.691]  I want more baby again!
[02:07:09.771 --> 02:07:09.851]  Why?
[02:07:09.871 --> 02:07:10.071]  Why?
[02:07:10.111 --> 02:07:10.171]  Why?
[02:07:37.329 --> 02:07:37.669]  I think so.
[02:08:27.516 --> 02:08:31.450]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:31.891 --> 02:08:33.096]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:36.547 --> 02:08:44.994]  Hillary Clinton, disgraced former Secretary of State, First Lady, Benghazi, Fast and Furious, Persecution of Christians, you name it, is speaking.
[02:08:45.374 --> 02:08:56.063]  Joe Biggs is there inside the lion's den with her minions, with the other self-propelled stomachs, wearing his Hillary for President 2016 shirt.
[02:08:56.744 --> 02:08:59.947]  Joe Biggs, let's hear a little bit from Hillary herself.
[02:09:01.268 --> 02:09:01.828]  Yeah, we'll try.
[02:09:01.848 --> 02:09:02.849]  We're kind of far back.
[02:09:03.209 --> 02:09:03.690]  Yay!
[02:09:04.904 --> 02:09:07.566]  She says that she's going to do everything she can for veterans.
[02:09:07.766 --> 02:09:09.448]  You taught me so much.
[02:09:09.948 --> 02:09:10.508]  I don't think so.
[02:09:10.648 --> 02:09:11.929]  You opened your homes.
[02:09:12.810 --> 02:09:13.891]  You believed in me.
[02:09:14.732 --> 02:09:15.973]  You worked hard for me.
[02:09:15.993 --> 02:09:19.956]  I'm running for president to work hard for you.
[02:09:22.337 --> 02:09:27.702]  She said that Americans have opened their homes for her and she is going to be running for president.
[02:09:27.722 --> 02:09:28.782]  Oh yeah, we're picking it up good.
[02:09:28.822 --> 02:09:29.563]  We can hear him.
[02:09:29.823 --> 02:09:30.063]  Okay.
[02:09:30.344 --> 02:09:31.645]  I'll get you and your little dog too.
[02:09:33.519 --> 02:09:43.441]  There was a presidential race going on back then, and I was sent by the Democratic National Committee to register Texas voters.
[02:09:46.042 --> 02:09:50.363]  So I came down here for the summer with my boyfriend.
[02:09:52.063 --> 02:09:53.403]  Hillary for prison!
[02:09:53.964 --> 02:09:55.824]  She's saying Castro's her boyfriend, did you hear that?
[02:09:56.769 --> 02:09:58.410]  Listen to that monotone, trained voice.
[02:09:58.430 --> 02:09:58.650]  So annoying.
[02:10:27.316 --> 02:10:34.678]  What he taught me back then and what he's continued to teach me is one of the many reasons I married him a few years later.
[02:10:34.838 --> 02:10:41.800]  And I gotta tell you, Phil and I fell in love with South Texas.
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:47.922]  We ate a lot of green enchiladas.
[02:10:47.942 --> 02:10:49.742]  Don't vote for Monica's boyfriend's wife.
[02:10:49.782 --> 02:10:51.943]  And what they do is they give him an anthropology briefing.
[02:10:53.610 --> 02:10:58.172]  Hit Shiner Bar, Green Enchiladas, South Texas.
[02:10:58.232 --> 02:11:01.153]  She's, she's, she's, this is CIA anthropology.
[02:11:01.553 --> 02:11:03.253]  Every area she goes to, she says the politics.
[02:11:03.273 --> 02:11:04.514]  She's a lifelong friend.
[02:11:04.534 --> 02:11:05.394]  Gosh, it's sick.
[02:11:05.574 --> 02:11:07.895]  And so many unforgettable experiences.
[02:11:08.415 --> 02:11:10.896]  Now, look, I was a blonde girl from Chicago.
[02:11:10.936 --> 02:11:18.178]  I hardly know a word of Spanish.
[02:11:18.859 --> 02:11:21.780]  But I drove around South Texas and the Valley.
[02:11:23.496 --> 02:11:24.417]  She just said she drove.
[02:11:36.534 --> 02:11:41.698]  I listened as people shared their stories, their worries, their dreams.
[02:11:41.758 --> 02:11:43.139]  Their worries, their dreams.
[02:11:43.259 --> 02:11:44.380]  I'm gonna give you your dreams.
[02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:45.821]  I'm gonna give you your dreams.
[02:11:46.342 --> 02:11:47.182]  I know your area.
[02:11:47.222 --> 02:11:48.103]  Green enchiladas.
[02:11:48.183 --> 02:11:48.944]  I'm your friend.
[02:11:49.244 --> 02:11:49.964]  I'm your friend.
[02:11:49.984 --> 02:11:50.925]  Obamacare.
[02:11:50.985 --> 02:11:51.606]  It's free.
[02:11:51.626 --> 02:11:52.506]  2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:11:55.169 --> 02:11:56.970]  Mothers, grandmothers, each group.
[02:11:57.450 --> 02:12:07.476]  Grandmothers, mothers, Vikings, Hispanics, all of you, black people, women, ooh, ooh, you're all getting mentioned, ooh, ooh, ooh, it's just, I mean, I'd get up there and give them a real speech.
[02:12:07.496 --> 02:12:11.078]  I wouldn't go, I know you're Shiner Bach and you're Green Enchiladas.
[02:12:11.098 --> 02:12:16.181]  She speaks in Kentucky, she goes, it's good to be here today.
[02:12:16.201 --> 02:12:19.803]  I don't know, gang, don't break it, girl.
[02:12:19.843 --> 02:12:20.604]  You think I'm joking?
[02:12:21.513 --> 02:12:22.895]  And then when she goes to, like, L.A.
[02:12:22.975 --> 02:12:26.620]  to speak in a Spanish group, she goes, Hello, good to see you today.
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:30.765]  I mean, this is the condescension of how dumb she thinks people are.
[02:12:31.786 --> 02:12:34.209]  Let's go back and listen to her in her monotone voice.
[02:12:34.550 --> 02:12:36.933]  And even better, it helped to send me to college.
[02:12:38.126 --> 02:12:40.347]  It's hard to hear me over the screams for help.
[02:13:00.265 --> 02:13:01.066]  Oh, it's disgusting.
[02:13:01.126 --> 02:13:06.553]  It's like a train full of idiots derailed and it all tipped over right here inside of this, uh, station.
[02:13:06.573 --> 02:13:08.716]  That place is like a giant toilet, actually.
[02:13:10.177 --> 02:13:11.579]  You know what?
[02:13:11.599 --> 02:13:12.901]  Yeah, sure.
[02:13:12.921 --> 02:13:13.762]  Why do you like Hillary Clinton?
[02:13:14.852 --> 02:13:16.334]  Well, many reasons why I like Hillary.
[02:13:16.574 --> 02:13:18.815]  Mostly because, well, she knows what she's talking about.
[02:13:18.835 --> 02:13:27.662]  Not like Carson, who, let's say, says a Muslim can't be president, but under the Constitution, anybody can be president, unless you're here from the United States, so... Ask him if he likes Sharia law.
[02:13:27.682 --> 02:13:28.242]  That's pretty cool.
[02:13:28.422 --> 02:13:29.323]  Would you say?
[02:13:29.343 --> 02:13:30.364]  Do you like Sharia law?
[02:13:31.144 --> 02:13:31.805]  No, I don't.
[02:13:32.145 --> 02:13:37.369]  But if you got, uh, what's-his-name, uh, Trump to be our president, you will have Sharia law.
[02:13:37.649 --> 02:13:38.970]  You will also have a lot of Sharia law.
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:43.901]  Because you have all these abortion people saying, hey, look, you know what?
[02:13:44.161 --> 02:13:44.942]  Abortion is bad.
[02:13:45.322 --> 02:13:49.763]  But we live in a country where pro-choice is the way to go.
[02:13:50.124 --> 02:13:51.824]  Because I believe in pro-life, actually.
[02:13:51.844 --> 02:13:52.485]  I'm a Christian.
[02:13:52.665 --> 02:13:53.485]  But that's my view.
[02:13:53.765 --> 02:13:54.465]  That's my belief.
[02:13:55.086 --> 02:13:55.366]  Okay?
[02:13:55.506 --> 02:14:00.408]  If I lived in a Sharia law kind of state, then my belief wouldn't matter.
[02:14:00.428 --> 02:14:03.449]  Well, tell him, Hillary wants to bring millions of radical Islamists here.
[02:14:03.509 --> 02:14:04.089]  That's not right.
[02:14:05.077 --> 02:14:05.958]  Ask him about Benghazi.
[02:14:06.018 --> 02:14:07.039]  Oh, really?
[02:14:07.139 --> 02:14:09.201]  I didn't hear about that.
[02:14:09.222 --> 02:14:09.962]  How is that possible?
[02:14:10.843 --> 02:14:11.344]  The migrants.
[02:14:11.364 --> 02:14:13.146]  What do you think?
[02:14:13.166 --> 02:14:14.968]  How's Hillary going to do anything for veterans?
[02:14:15.028 --> 02:14:15.748]  Answer that question.
[02:14:15.869 --> 02:14:17.630]  How is she bringing in radicals?
[02:14:17.650 --> 02:14:18.091]  You tell me.
[02:14:18.111 --> 02:14:19.873]  The migrants.
[02:14:20.053 --> 02:14:24.197]  She has the most chalacked immigration policy.
[02:14:24.217 --> 02:14:25.479]  She wants to allow everybody in.
[02:14:26.897 --> 02:14:27.537]  Let me tell you something.
[02:14:27.557 --> 02:14:28.338]  Let me tell you something.
[02:14:28.518 --> 02:14:30.538]  Almost every country out there has immigration laws.
[02:14:30.599 --> 02:14:33.460]  If I'm going to answer a question, it goes back... You actually came over here to me.
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:34.040]  I didn't come to you.
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:35.480]  Well, then you're going to play my game.
[02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:38.001]  You're going to play my game.
[02:14:38.402 --> 02:14:41.543]  We want to hear Stalin talk.
[02:14:44.544 --> 02:14:49.386]  My grandparents came from Mexico, and... Oh, look, the little bossy woman doesn't want us to talk.
[02:14:49.466 --> 02:14:50.667]  Oh, God, talk to that feminist.
[02:14:50.687 --> 02:14:51.887]  Look at that pea brain.
[02:14:51.947 --> 02:14:54.068]  Talk to the pea brain.
[02:14:55.199 --> 02:14:56.180]  Come on, talk to Peabrain!
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:59.542]  Okay, let's hear what you have to say.
[02:14:59.622 --> 02:15:04.266]  I just want you guys to scoot out of the way and be respectful of the people that are here.
[02:15:04.826 --> 02:15:07.648]  We're still interviewing, Peabrain.
[02:15:07.708 --> 02:15:09.329]  Ask her if she's for free speech.
[02:15:09.609 --> 02:15:10.910]  I can interview whoever I want.
[02:15:11.271 --> 02:15:11.931]  Hillary for prison.
[02:15:12.392 --> 02:15:16.154]  Well, then how about you turn that way, then, and watch what she's saying?
[02:15:16.414 --> 02:15:19.297]  Well, then don't tell me that you can't hear what she's saying or see.
[02:15:20.791 --> 02:15:21.712]  That's pretty ignorant, right?
[02:15:22.093 --> 02:15:22.914]  Roger that.
[02:15:23.495 --> 02:15:27.019]  So as you can see, there's a lot of mindless zombies out here.
[02:15:27.039 --> 02:15:27.600]  Oh, I know.
[02:15:27.620 --> 02:15:31.806]  That's a peabird right there.
[02:15:31.946 --> 02:15:33.448]  I'm here because Hillary for women.
[02:15:33.468 --> 02:15:35.190]  I do have one more thing to say.
[02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:36.812]  You talk about Hillary going to prison.
[02:15:36.972 --> 02:15:38.074]  This is what's really interesting.
[02:15:38.712 --> 02:15:46.216]  Back in the Iran-Contra scandal, when Reagan was lying to the people about selling cocaine... Bring up Benghazi to him.
[02:15:46.597 --> 02:15:47.517]  What do you call a minority?
[02:15:47.537 --> 02:15:48.157]  Yeah, we know about that.
[02:15:48.197 --> 02:15:48.838]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:15:48.858 --> 02:15:49.538]  We're not worried about that.
[02:15:49.558 --> 02:15:49.858]  We know.
[02:15:50.018 --> 02:15:51.179]  Look, I don't care about that.
[02:15:51.199 --> 02:15:51.579]  That's old.
[02:15:51.619 --> 02:15:52.180]  We already know that.
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:52.780]  Trust me.
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:54.641]  If you know who this is, trust me, we know about that.
[02:15:54.661 --> 02:15:55.582]  Okay, but guess what?
[02:15:55.642 --> 02:15:57.823]  I'm talking about who's running for president now.
[02:15:57.863 --> 02:15:58.543]  I don't care about that.
[02:15:58.944 --> 02:15:59.424]  Benghazi?
[02:16:01.165 --> 02:16:02.065]  Bush.
[02:16:02.085 --> 02:16:02.605]  Benghazi.
[02:16:02.645 --> 02:16:03.485]  Little Bush.
[02:16:04.186 --> 02:16:10.628]  One of his things that he does to cut costs was to cut a lot of... And they call him a member of the Bush family.
[02:16:10.648 --> 02:16:11.849]  She calls him her brother.
[02:16:11.869 --> 02:16:13.590]  One of the areas that was cut was Benghazi.
[02:16:13.790 --> 02:16:15.910]  So probably had in Benghazi... We're against Bush too, buddy.
[02:16:16.431 --> 02:16:19.472]  ...enough guards there to defend that area and stuff.
[02:16:19.512 --> 02:16:22.073]  That's the reason why there was a lot of deaths in Benghazi.
[02:16:22.393 --> 02:16:23.594]  So let's get that straight.
[02:16:23.614 --> 02:16:24.634]  So we're not funding the rebels?
[02:16:24.654 --> 02:16:25.554]  We're not funding the rebels?
[02:16:28.234 --> 02:16:29.996]  Anything else you want to ask me?
[02:16:30.016 --> 02:16:30.497]  Yeah, I do.
[02:16:30.517 --> 02:16:32.099]  Alex, do you have any other questions for him?
[02:16:32.119 --> 02:16:37.807]  Well, I mean, Hillary funded the radical Islamists in the State Department in Syria.
[02:16:38.127 --> 02:16:40.030]  What does he think about Russia standing up against that?
[02:16:41.832 --> 02:16:44.414]  So Hillary funded the Syrian modern rebels.
[02:16:44.454 --> 02:16:47.116]  How do you feel about Russia stepping in and bombing ISIS?
[02:16:47.136 --> 02:16:48.738]  They are just as smart.
[02:16:49.018 --> 02:16:53.722]  Russia actually makes a lot of money off of the president of Syria.
[02:16:53.902 --> 02:16:55.443]  I'm talking trillions of dollars.
[02:16:55.503 --> 02:16:56.404]  Trillions?
[02:16:56.965 --> 02:16:59.086]  He's really bombing all the people over there.
[02:16:59.126 --> 02:17:01.068]  They're actually going against that president.
[02:17:01.128 --> 02:17:04.811]  Not really the Syrian, what's it called, ISIS or any of them and stuff.
[02:17:04.951 --> 02:17:06.132]  That's really the truth of it all.
[02:17:06.533 --> 02:17:07.473]  Also, in Iraq,
[02:17:08.655 --> 02:17:09.316]  What do you call it?
[02:17:10.218 --> 02:17:18.032]  President Putin also sold a lot of stuff to the Iraqis such as night vision goggles and other stuff like that.
[02:17:18.352 --> 02:17:19.354]  So if you're for
[02:17:20.858 --> 02:17:28.981]  You know, bombing over there in Syria, you're for a guy that was bombing those kind of veterans over there that were helping in Iraq and stuff.
[02:17:29.001 --> 02:17:31.182]  Well, actually, I ain't a veteran, buddy.
[02:17:31.202 --> 02:17:32.002]  Then you should know.
[02:17:32.202 --> 02:17:33.522]  And that's pretty messed up, baby.
[02:17:33.663 --> 02:17:36.243]  The Russians didn't give anything to the Iraqi opposition.
[02:17:36.263 --> 02:17:38.444]  No, I don't support our country supplying weapons to Iraq.
[02:17:38.464 --> 02:17:39.505]  Saddam bought from the US and Iraq.
[02:17:39.645 --> 02:17:40.325]  I mean, and the Russians.
[02:17:40.965 --> 02:17:43.107]  We don't supply.
[02:17:43.228 --> 02:17:44.309]  We've never supplied weapons.
[02:17:44.329 --> 02:17:45.410]  I'll tell you who we're supplying to.
[02:17:45.430 --> 02:17:48.994]  We're supplying to the people over there who are the moderate rebels.
[02:17:49.014 --> 02:17:49.855]  That's just another name.
[02:17:50.155 --> 02:17:52.317]  It's a political name.
[02:17:52.678 --> 02:17:56.222]  It's just like when you say, when a president says you support our troops.
[02:17:56.542 --> 02:17:57.783]  They don't mean do you support our troops.
[02:17:57.803 --> 02:18:00.046]  What they mean is, do you support our policies?
[02:18:01.247 --> 02:18:01.968]  It's a mind trick.
[02:18:02.008 --> 02:18:06.651]  It's propaganda to trick you, the viewer, who just watches and believes everything on TV, to go along with it.
[02:18:06.831 --> 02:18:09.052]  So that way it guilt trips you into saying, yeah, I'm for the troops.
[02:18:09.112 --> 02:18:10.553]  I'm not against them, obviously.
[02:18:10.673 --> 02:18:18.358]  But what you said yes to is actually the policies of going over and bombing countries, going into countries we don't belong in, playing Team America World Police.
[02:18:18.378 --> 02:18:19.819]  What do you think Hillary Clinton's going to do?
[02:18:19.839 --> 02:18:24.442]  She used to be an anti-war hippie, and now she's one of the biggest war mongers out there.
[02:18:24.462 --> 02:18:25.123]  She attacked Syria.
[02:18:25.183 --> 02:18:26.784]  OK, well, you brought up some really great points.
[02:18:27.264 --> 02:18:28.405]  I really appreciate that stuff.
[02:18:28.425 --> 02:18:29.225]  She attacked Serbia.
[02:18:30.706 --> 02:18:38.309]  Number one, uh, before we talk about warmongering, let's look at one of our last, what do you call it, uh, vice presidents, Cheney, who's one of the biggest warmongers.
[02:18:38.329 --> 02:18:39.649]  No, we don't like, I don't like him either.
[02:18:39.729 --> 02:18:40.069]  I hate him.
[02:18:40.629 --> 02:18:42.330]  So, that's, that's warmongers.
[02:18:42.610 --> 02:18:44.251]  You know, you should really look for those kind of people.
[02:18:44.291 --> 02:18:45.431]  He just, he doesn't listen.
[02:18:45.711 --> 02:18:47.232]  Well, I don't have to worry about them now.
[02:18:47.312 --> 02:18:49.972]  I'm worrying about the next president who's gonna run my country into the ground.
[02:18:49.992 --> 02:18:51.273]  The last guy's been screwing up.
[02:18:51.913 --> 02:18:55.796]  Every promise he said, we're going to close down Guantanamo, we're going to pull everybody out of Afghanistan.
[02:18:55.836 --> 02:18:56.136]  Guess what?
[02:18:56.156 --> 02:18:57.798]  We're leaving 5,500 more troops.
[02:18:58.078 --> 02:18:58.918]  That's what Obama's doing.
[02:18:58.958 --> 02:19:00.239]  He hasn't done one thing he said.
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:02.881]  I don't want another Barack Obama, because guess what?
[02:19:03.101 --> 02:19:05.643]  Hillary Clinton's going to be another Obama, and she's another Clinton.
[02:19:05.683 --> 02:19:06.384]  We don't need that.
[02:19:06.404 --> 02:19:15.090]  Well, when you have a Republican, what do you call it, party president saying that his whole big thing, idea, is... See, he just thinks we're Republicans.
[02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:16.131]  He just identifies as Hillary.
[02:19:17.452 --> 02:19:18.873]  We're against the establishment candidates.
[02:19:19.493 --> 02:19:20.734]  We've heard all the Democratic talking points, Joe.
[02:19:20.754 --> 02:19:21.054]  That's good.
[02:19:21.074 --> 02:19:22.795]  You probably want to move on to somebody else, Joe.
[02:19:22.815 --> 02:19:24.436]  We're going to hear what he's saying.
[02:19:34.705 --> 02:19:36.306]  Hillary Clinton.
[02:19:36.366 --> 02:19:40.930]  Alright Joe, we're going to break.
[02:19:41.650 --> 02:19:42.811]  You're doing a great job.
[02:19:43.232 --> 02:19:44.773]  This is pretty informative stuff.
[02:19:45.253 --> 02:19:51.358]  Take a break a few minutes and then just get the holding pattern there because I have a feeling they're about to try to throw you out.
[02:19:51.378 --> 02:19:52.178]  There's a Secret Service.
[02:19:52.478 --> 02:19:53.920]  Let's get some pans of the Secret Service.
[02:19:54.580 --> 02:19:59.547]  And then we're going to come back with one more segment, then I'm going to get into the really big news here straight ahead.
[02:20:00.148 --> 02:20:03.793]  Joe Biggs in the middle of the Hillary moron train.
[02:20:04.193 --> 02:20:04.614]  We'll be back.
[02:20:08.382 --> 02:20:17.706]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day, but growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.
[02:20:17.826 --> 02:20:22.128]  The solution is DefenderShield, the most effective mobile radiation shielding ever developed.

[02:20:39.379 --> 02:20:40.880]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:20:41.180 --> 02:20:42.481]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:20:42.841 --> 02:20:45.163]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:20:45.664 --> 02:20:47.505]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:20:47.945 --> 02:20:52.008]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:20:52.469 --> 02:20:56.172]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:20:56.412 --> 02:20:59.855]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:21:00.175 --> 02:21:00.595]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:21:00.615 --> 02:21:02.236]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:21:07.731 --> 02:21:14.052]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[02:21:14.432 --> 02:21:19.393]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[02:21:19.913 --> 02:21:23.914]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about.
[02:21:24.454 --> 02:21:28.315]  This change has deep implications for life in America.
[02:21:28.735 --> 02:21:32.996]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit and the family you want to protect,
[02:21:33.596 --> 02:21:36.337]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[02:21:36.717 --> 02:21:38.938]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[02:21:39.658 --> 02:21:43.600]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:44.580]  They did.
[02:21:45.181 --> 02:21:49.602]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[02:21:50.243 --> 02:21:50.703]  They did.
[02:21:51.383 --> 02:21:54.684]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[02:21:55.245 --> 02:21:57.266]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[02:21:57.606 --> 02:21:58.786]  This will affect us all.
[02:21:59.126 --> 02:22:00.947]  You can watch the video for free right now.
[02:22:01.127 --> 02:22:01.788]  We're good.
[02:22:07.722 --> 02:22:10.944]  Young people are supposed to be full of energy and recover quickly from exercise.
[02:22:11.284 --> 02:22:14.486]  Their age should give them a great advantage to feeling good all the time.
[02:22:14.866 --> 02:22:20.490]  However, young people of today are dealing with the same nutrient-deficient food as everyone else in America.
[02:22:20.810 --> 02:22:22.831]  So it does not matter whether you are 15 or 85.
[02:22:22.911 --> 02:22:26.434]  If your biochemistry is off, you cannot feel your best.
[02:22:26.634 --> 02:22:28.815]  Listen to the real-world results of James.
[02:22:29.195 --> 02:22:30.336]  My name is James Ashley.
[02:22:30.396 --> 02:22:31.617]  I'm 25 years old.
[02:22:32.037 --> 02:22:34.999]  At the end of a tiring work shift, I used to not do much around the house.
[02:22:35.239 --> 02:22:45.346]  Since I started taking the new Technology Enhance One World Way after work, I have so much energy when I get home that I'm able to take long walks, do chores, and even honey to-do lists from the wife.
[02:22:45.606 --> 02:22:50.129]  It's plenty enough energy to get things done around the house and time to settle down before bedtime.
[02:22:50.309 --> 02:22:54.372]  This whey protein gives me outstanding amount of long-lasting, feel-good energy.
[02:22:54.712 --> 02:22:57.694]  I'm astonished of how great this product makes me feel.
[02:22:58.214 --> 02:22:59.938]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:22:59.998 --> 02:23:00.740]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:23:07.629 --> 02:23:14.795]  Numana, the true pioneer of healthy storable foods and preparedness products, has gone and done it again.
[02:23:15.376 --> 02:23:22.181]  Numana is now the first food storage company in the country to offer organic powdered milk, free of hormones.
[02:23:22.822 --> 02:23:25.944]  Our goal is to change the way you look at storable food.
[02:23:26.665 --> 02:23:34.131]  Numana is GMO-free, contains no high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, or artificial ingredients.

[02:23:42.674 --> 02:23:51.556]  We also offer the revolutionary Defender Pack, which combines organic superfoods with the GMO free meals our customers rave about.
[02:23:51.576 --> 02:23:53.717]  Go to numana.com or call 888-597-0775 today to learn more.
[02:23:53.737 --> 02:23:54.137]  That's 888-597-0775.
[02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:06.082]  New Manor, food storage you'll love to eat!
[02:24:08.403 --> 02:24:16.468]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[02:24:16.488 --> 02:24:19.629]  We got shots of San Antonio police officers, Secret Service, you name it.
[02:24:19.669 --> 02:24:26.273]  Joe is over the fence, inside the Hillary... Moron Factory.
[02:24:26.293 --> 02:24:28.974]  And I'm sorry, these people really are helpless.
[02:24:29.234 --> 02:24:31.756]  Just like some mainline Jeb Bush supporters are.
[02:24:33.186 --> 02:24:42.974]  And we're sitting there trying to explain to the guy we're against Hillary because she's involved in all these wars, she's a huge basically neocon, and he just keeps going back to Ronald Reagan who's dead.
[02:24:44.375 --> 02:24:47.077]  We get both parties have major problems, but the Democrats...
[02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:51.702]  Well actually most of them, the actual local police are looking at me smiling.
[02:25:18.756 --> 02:25:20.217]  ...are agreeing with my shirt.
[02:25:20.657 --> 02:25:24.180]  Every now and then you'll see them kind of look over and nod and you'll see like a smirk happen or whatever.
[02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:29.163]  But they're trying to be professional in that show, any kind of political side or favoring whatsoever.
[02:25:29.543 --> 02:25:34.546]  But obviously people out here screaming Hillary for prison, you know, go to jail for war crimes.
[02:25:34.566 --> 02:25:38.149]  Now you have people over here screaming that Hillary needs to go to the White House.
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:46.468]  Like I said, a train full of idiots wrecked, flipped over, and it all poured out here into this area, and it's just a whole nother world.
[02:25:46.728 --> 02:25:49.010]  What did you think of that guy's canned responses?
[02:25:49.050 --> 02:25:50.572]  He wasn't listening to anything.
[02:25:50.612 --> 02:25:55.838]  He just likes Hillary, even though he doesn't like her policies, and he just supports her mindlessly.
[02:25:57.873 --> 02:25:59.154]  That's how most of the people are here.
[02:25:59.174 --> 02:26:01.615]  I mean, that's how most of the people who are going to vote for Hillary Clinton are.
[02:26:01.635 --> 02:26:02.115]  They're mindless.
[02:26:02.535 --> 02:26:03.676]  They have no idea.
[02:26:03.696 --> 02:26:05.016]  They don't really look at the facts.
[02:26:05.036 --> 02:26:05.897]  They don't actually go in.
[02:26:06.477 --> 02:26:11.379]  This is a whole country that's just obsessed with being progressive and trendy and cool.
[02:26:11.719 --> 02:26:13.080]  You know, we just had the last guy.
[02:26:13.140 --> 02:26:14.100]  He was black at first.
[02:26:14.420 --> 02:26:17.161]  So now automatically we have to have the first female president.
[02:26:17.561 --> 02:26:21.143]  And if not, we're misogynist, we're sexist, racist, you know.
[02:26:21.690 --> 02:26:24.333]  And it's that whole same thing that they keep serving to us every day.
[02:26:24.914 --> 02:26:26.996]  Joe Biggs, who are you really liking?
[02:26:27.016 --> 02:26:28.818]  I mean, obviously, I like what Trump says.
[02:26:28.838 --> 02:26:30.040]  I like the fact he's aggressive.
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:38.089]  I don't know if I trust his history, but now they're moving to basically go after Rand Paul and Ron Paul, indicting their former chief of staff for nothing.
[02:26:38.730 --> 02:26:39.491]  Literally nothing.
[02:26:39.571 --> 02:26:41.213]  I mean, this is getting, this is getting creepy.
[02:26:42.403 --> 02:26:44.845]  Well, it shows you they're scared of, you know, the Pauls, obviously.
[02:26:44.885 --> 02:26:47.187]  I mean, these are people who go out and speak the truth.
[02:26:47.227 --> 02:26:54.051]  You know, there are some things that Rand Paul does that I quite, you know, I don't really agree with, but there's more things that he does do that I do go with.
[02:26:54.392 --> 02:27:00.516]  You know, Donald Trump, like we've said before, he says a lot of great things, but at the same time, he doesn't offer a lot of solutions.
[02:27:00.896 --> 02:27:01.877]  It's still early in the race.
[02:27:01.937 --> 02:27:06.360]  I'm still hoping for him to come out and kind of give me some solutions to these problems that he's bringing to the table.
[02:27:06.781 --> 02:27:09.763]  You know, building a wall simply will not fix this immigration problem.
[02:27:10.203 --> 02:27:11.183]  We've been to the border before.
[02:27:11.223 --> 02:27:12.484]  We've shown how wide open it is.
[02:27:12.524 --> 02:27:18.485]  And even if there is a fence there, in places in Arizona or Texas that have fences, people say, like, get over it.
[02:27:18.545 --> 02:27:19.166]  They go under it.
[02:27:19.226 --> 02:27:19.926]  They figure out a way.
[02:27:19.946 --> 02:27:20.566]  They pay somebody.
[02:27:20.586 --> 02:27:21.686]  They get stuck in the back of a trunk.
[02:27:22.287 --> 02:27:24.787]  We need to do something more than just building a wall.
[02:27:24.807 --> 02:27:26.508]  And that's just going to be a big waste of money.
[02:27:26.888 --> 02:27:28.208]  But, you know, like I said, it's early.
[02:27:28.288 --> 02:27:29.909]  He's got time to come out with some other things.
[02:27:30.489 --> 02:27:33.890]  You know, I think Webb on the Democrat side really doesn't fit over there.
[02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:36.091]  I think he should have been in the GOP race.
[02:27:36.131 --> 02:27:37.351]  He doesn't really seem to have the
[02:27:38.171 --> 02:27:42.852]  The equalities of the other candidates that were running for the Democratic contender.
[02:27:42.872 --> 02:27:44.253]  So who knows?
[02:27:44.293 --> 02:27:45.213]  Like I said, it's still early.
[02:27:45.293 --> 02:27:45.993]  We'll see what happens.
[02:27:46.033 --> 02:27:50.694]  But at this point in time, what I do know 100% is that this woman does not belong in there.
[02:27:51.015 --> 02:27:53.135]  She does not belong in the White House.
[02:27:53.155 --> 02:27:56.496]  She does not belong as our president.
[02:27:56.816 --> 02:28:04.758]  It's disgusting to see this many people show up in support of this woman knowing that she's going into this with so many lies on the table.
[02:28:05.979 --> 02:28:06.819]  If you're going to run for
[02:28:07.540 --> 02:28:08.121]  Well, I agree and...
[02:28:22.435 --> 02:28:24.736]  I just can't believe that she's gotten away with so much.
[02:28:24.796 --> 02:28:27.458]  I mean, I can't really think of anybody more corrupt than Hillary Clinton.
[02:28:28.118 --> 02:28:34.341]  And if she crawled under a rock like Bush or something, it'd be one thing, but she just hangs around forever.
[02:28:34.881 --> 02:28:39.924]  They've been on air, I mean, they've been in politics since I was a little kid.
[02:28:40.544 --> 02:28:45.927]  And I've been on air 20 years, having to cover Hillary Clinton, and I am so sick of her.
[02:28:46.027 --> 02:28:49.448]  I mean, it's like, it's a bad movie that I'm sick of looking at.
[02:28:49.488 --> 02:28:50.669]  It's like Groundhog Day, Joe.
[02:28:52.578 --> 02:28:53.079]  Exactly.
[02:28:53.099 --> 02:28:54.920]  I remember when Bill Purce started running.
[02:28:55.500 --> 02:28:56.221]  I was very young.
[02:28:56.241 --> 02:28:59.624]  I remember that happening and my teacher asking me, why don't you like Bill Clinton?
[02:28:59.964 --> 02:29:05.288]  And I just said some, you know, childish answer at the time, but it turned out to be right.
[02:29:05.468 --> 02:29:08.670]  These guys have a bad history and they're going to continue.
[02:29:09.071 --> 02:29:11.873]  And the biggest thing is whenever you run into feminists,
[02:29:13.092 --> 02:29:22.239]  And they say they're pro-women, they're pro-empowerment and all this and that, but they never really look at the fact that the Clintons take money from these different countries that simply treat women like garbage.
[02:29:22.659 --> 02:29:25.221]  So how can you say that you're for women and then you allow that to happen?
[02:29:25.561 --> 02:29:27.823]  Or say that you want to empower women to do the right thing?
[02:29:28.263 --> 02:29:34.184]  But then you sit there and cover up for your husband who's, you know, having affairs and, you know, you're having his back.
[02:29:34.264 --> 02:29:35.104]  Absolutely, Joe.
[02:29:35.204 --> 02:29:36.285]  That doesn't show empowerment.
[02:29:36.565 --> 02:29:37.345]  Keep reporting.
[02:29:37.385 --> 02:29:37.905]  Great job.
[02:29:37.925 --> 02:29:40.605]  We'll have more of your footage on the Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:29:41.086 --> 02:29:50.367]  I'm going to come back and break down political persecution in America and the Feds creating new units run by the Democrats and the Southern Poverty Law Center to persecute the patriots.
[02:29:50.447 --> 02:29:51.568]  And it's certainly accelerating.
[02:29:51.928 --> 02:29:53.548]  Key information straight ahead.
[02:29:57.203 --> 02:30:00.225]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:00.245 --> 02:30:03.927]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:08.109 --> 02:30:20.596]  The Obama administration is spending $75 million a year arming special agents with the Environmental Protection Agency with drones, night vision goggles, camouflage, guns, and assault ships.
[02:30:20.877 --> 02:30:24.379]  The EPA is equipping its own army to take out U.S.
[02:30:24.439 --> 02:30:24.939]  polluters.
[02:30:25.299 --> 02:30:39.651]  Watchdog Group opened the books, examined thousands of checks totaling more than 93 billion dollars from 2000 to 2014, and they found that 75 million is authorized each year for criminal enforcement of America's clean air and water laws.
[02:30:39.891 --> 02:30:43.173]  Some of these weapons are for full-scale military operations.
[02:30:43.434 --> 02:30:51.160]  Two years ago, the EPA was involved in an armed raid at a small town in Alaska, where miners were accused of polluting local waters.
[02:30:51.420 --> 02:31:04.968]  It's incredibly ironic considering that it was the Environmental Protection Agency who was recently guilty of dumping millions of pounds of toxic wastewater into the Animas River in Colorado, causing untold damage to the environment for years to come.

[02:32:38.706 --> 02:32:40.807]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:32:40.907 --> 02:32:45.648]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:32:45.888 --> 02:32:49.049]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:32:49.189 --> 02:32:52.410]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:32:52.670 --> 02:32:54.470]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:32:54.650 --> 02:32:58.651]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.
[02:32:58.751 --> 02:33:04.352]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:33:18.639 --> 02:33:20.140]  This is our land.
[02:33:23.242 --> 02:33:24.703]  These are our people.
[02:33:24.723 --> 02:33:27.325]  The workers.
[02:33:27.365 --> 02:33:29.126]  The strivers.
[02:33:30.453 --> 02:33:36.914]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:58.358 --> 02:34:01.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:07.364 --> 02:34:08.845]  We're live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:34:08.865 --> 02:34:12.387]  We have an hour and a half left in the worldwide broadcast.
[02:34:12.447 --> 02:34:14.488]  Rob Dues is going to be hosting the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[02:34:14.888 --> 02:34:18.251]  Cover the latest breaking news and get into a Merck whistleblower.
[02:34:19.321 --> 02:34:21.944]  is going to be joining him.
[02:34:22.304 --> 02:34:27.169]  This whistleblower has made international headlines exposing what they knew vaccines were really doing.
[02:34:27.590 --> 02:34:29.231]  This is bombshell information.
[02:34:29.292 --> 02:34:30.493]  I suggest you tape this.
[02:34:31.214 --> 02:34:35.818]  I suggest you download this live transmission and you share it with your friends and family.
[02:34:36.579 --> 02:34:40.560]  That have been told there's no problem with vaccines, that they're safe and effective.
[02:34:41.420 --> 02:34:44.001]  This is going to be some key intel coming up in the fourth hour.
[02:34:44.021 --> 02:34:45.202]  He's going to cover some other news as well.
[02:34:45.602 --> 02:34:46.782]  That's half of the fourth hour.
[02:34:47.162 --> 02:34:53.504]  We'll be with that whistleblower, Rob Dew, Infowars Nightly News Director, hosting the fourth hour.
[02:34:54.144 --> 02:34:55.865]  Paul Watson hosted the Nightly News last night.
[02:34:55.885 --> 02:34:56.645]  It was extremely powerful.
[02:34:57.898 --> 02:34:59.980]  I'm gonna try to recap what I covered in the first hour.
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:02.242]  Paul Watson's doing a big article on it right now.
[02:35:02.382 --> 02:35:06.025]  I'm gonna then work with him some this evening as well on a piece for tomorrow.
[02:35:07.110 --> 02:35:10.511]  It's great to have Paul Watson here in Austin with us.
[02:35:10.531 --> 02:35:12.371]  He's going to go back to England next week.
[02:35:12.411 --> 02:35:14.872]  He's going to be covering a Monsanto march in D.C.
[02:35:16.092 --> 02:35:19.733]  with his girlfriend this weekend up in D.C.
[02:35:19.753 --> 02:35:21.874]  She's over visiting on work in D.C.
[02:35:21.914 --> 02:35:26.475]  so he's going to rendezvous with her, have a little play and a little work all at the same time.
[02:35:26.495 --> 02:35:28.436]  That makes sure Jack's not an adult boy, doesn't it?
[02:35:29.616 --> 02:35:35.198]  So that is coming up at Rob Dew in the fourth hour today.
[02:35:37.253 --> 02:35:46.203]  Before we go any further, and I get into this and play these clips we haven't gotten to yet, I just want to remind listeners that we've got some exciting news.
[02:35:47.665 --> 02:35:57.336]  Super Mel Vitality that is a concentrated, organic, cold-pressed herbs and then key compounds to trigger the herbs.
[02:35:59.335 --> 02:36:01.077]  That doesn't mimic testosterone.
[02:36:01.517 --> 02:36:07.722]  What it does is it gets your body, according to Dr. Grip's research, to get your naturally to release more key hormones.
[02:36:08.343 --> 02:36:09.664]  Now, that's what we believe it's doing.
[02:36:09.764 --> 02:36:11.726]  All I know is you can try it for yourself.
[02:36:11.766 --> 02:36:26.679]  These are well-known herbs associated with male vitality, with stamina, with energy, with... I'll just tell you quite frankly, the first thing I noticed, because Grip was joking around about it, and I took it one day, and the next morning was like, wow!
[02:36:27.419 --> 02:36:28.439]  Am I 20 years old again?
[02:36:28.499 --> 02:36:29.940]  And I'm just not trying to get graphic here.
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:31.400]  It's just, it's the real deal.
[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:32.900]  It's the real deal.
[02:36:34.580 --> 02:36:38.901]  You can read the rave reviews at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:36:38.941 --> 02:36:44.682]  We have links to third-party review sites that go over all of that.
[02:36:45.122 --> 02:36:46.883]  We're also running a bunch of specials.
[02:36:46.903 --> 02:36:48.203]  We like to have specials every week.
[02:36:48.223 --> 02:36:51.484]  I've got to say this week's specials are particularly wide spectrum.
[02:36:51.504 --> 02:36:52.104]  20% off
[02:36:54.508 --> 02:36:59.231]  Secret 12, vitamin B12, sublingual, under the tongue drops.
[02:37:01.473 --> 02:37:09.178]  We also have 10% off and free shipping on water filters.
[02:37:10.359 --> 02:37:13.081]  And we have 10% off and free shipping on storable food.
[02:37:13.861 --> 02:37:17.364]  And to do free shipping on storable food is a big, big deal.
[02:37:18.203 --> 02:37:19.204]  Because it's obviously heavy.
[02:37:19.904 --> 02:37:23.587]  And that's InfoWarsSelect.com, powered by MyPatriotSupply.
[02:37:24.027 --> 02:37:26.389]  We have MyPatriotSupply right next to InfoWars Select.
[02:37:26.509 --> 02:37:29.070]  Exact same food, packaged at the same time.
[02:37:29.431 --> 02:37:31.632]  They got their factory going where this stuff's like a week old.
[02:37:32.293 --> 02:37:33.654]  It lasts 25 years.
[02:37:34.774 --> 02:37:39.938]  It's totally sealed inside these big vacuum-packed plastic containers, and then sub-containers within it.
[02:37:40.698 --> 02:37:44.481]  They've got the best packaging, the highest quality food, and it is some of the most competitive.
[02:37:44.881 --> 02:37:46.903]  Cheap crud costs as much as this.
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:49.381]  That people totally discount.
[02:37:49.421 --> 02:37:54.766]  This is quality food, a lot of calories, what I chose for my family, doing a lot of research.
[02:37:54.786 --> 02:37:56.768]  Because I could have three or four storable foods companies here.
[02:37:57.609 --> 02:38:00.472]  And I just won't have the bad mojo, the bad karma, whatever you want to call it.
[02:38:01.112 --> 02:38:03.735]  And I know in Hinduism there's no such thing as bad karma, it's just karma.
[02:38:03.755 --> 02:38:04.556]  I don't really believe.
[02:38:04.876 --> 02:38:05.777]  You reap what you sow.
[02:38:05.817 --> 02:38:07.118]  Let's use a Bible allegory.
[02:38:08.980 --> 02:38:10.141]  I am a superstitious person.
[02:38:10.641 --> 02:38:11.983]  I will not screw anybody over.
[02:38:13.038 --> 02:38:17.023]  In fact, even my enemies now, I just expose them and try to fight the big enemies.
[02:38:17.063 --> 02:38:19.487]  Little enemies, I just let them attack me because I just feel sorry for them.
[02:38:19.507 --> 02:38:21.349]  They're such fallen, weak, pathetic people.
[02:38:22.230 --> 02:38:24.333]  I'm not bragging saying I'm some great guy.
[02:38:24.393 --> 02:38:26.376]  It's just that's why I've been so blessed, I know, is that
[02:38:27.737 --> 02:38:32.078]  I don't try to do people right because of that metaphysical rule.
[02:38:32.538 --> 02:38:34.319]  I am just like that to begin with.
[02:38:34.799 --> 02:38:38.720]  But even if you were a bad person, you wouldn't want to screw people over because it comes back on you.
[02:38:38.740 --> 02:38:39.300]  That's all I'm telling you.
[02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:41.801]  And people don't seem to understand that.
[02:38:41.941 --> 02:38:43.181]  They just don't seem to know that.
[02:38:43.201 --> 02:38:51.003]  What I'm saying is, whether it's our nutraceuticals, or whether it's storable food, or whether it's water filtration systems, we try to bring you the very best.
[02:38:51.203 --> 02:38:54.584]  And if something better for the price than ProPure G2 comes out,
[02:38:56.337 --> 02:38:58.077]  And is the same price or just a little bit more?
[02:38:58.738 --> 02:38:59.918]  I'm going to advertise that.
[02:39:01.138 --> 02:39:09.360]  I found some filters that I think are as good as the G2 system and are comparably priced, so I'm going to be adding those in the next week.
[02:39:10.100 --> 02:39:10.480]  Next week.
[02:39:12.441 --> 02:39:12.901]  To the site.
[02:39:12.961 --> 02:39:19.022]  I mean, it's like we got like eight or nine, this is more than that now, companies of non-GMO, high-quality heirloom seeds.
[02:39:22.083 --> 02:39:22.203]  And
[02:39:23.325 --> 02:39:29.309]  We've got just a whole bunch of companies there, and we get the lowest prices in contracts with folks because I want to be the InfoWars Seed Center.
[02:39:30.029 --> 02:39:35.472]  I want to sell the widest variety of high-quality seeds at the lowest price that we can legally give you.
[02:39:36.313 --> 02:39:40.515]  By legally, again, you have to sign contracts because we'll go so low that we're so competitive.
[02:39:41.076 --> 02:39:46.939]  So, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, a lot of different specials right now.
[02:39:46.999 --> 02:39:48.200]  If you missed any of them, you can call.
[02:39:49.620 --> 02:39:52.881]  Our great crew, until 6 o'clock every night, like 8 a.m.
[02:39:52.901 --> 02:39:55.182]  to 6 o'clock, answers the phones, then it goes to an answering service.
[02:39:55.202 --> 02:40:07.447]  If they're knowledgeable, right here in Austin, Texas, they can answer your questions and take your order, but I think our crew, obviously, is in-house, so they're even more informed.
[02:40:07.467 --> 02:40:08.148]  888-253-3139.
[02:40:08.168 --> 02:40:08.448]  888-253-3139.
[02:40:09.448 --> 02:40:14.550]  We can answer all your questions and tip on different specials that are available, but Super Bowl Vitality is now back in.
[02:40:14.971 --> 02:40:18.312]  Okay, we've only got, in this hour, about 20 minutes left, so I need to move now.
[02:40:21.957 --> 02:40:33.359]  A lot of times, news comes together in a confluence, or I guess you could call it an aligning of the stars, and then you really take a deep breath and go, my gosh, it really is that bad.
[02:40:34.639 --> 02:40:37.200]  The government has been hijacked by foreign banks.
[02:40:37.260 --> 02:40:38.600]  They brag about this at Davos.
[02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:42.341]  They brag about it, you know, in official UN documents that we've covered.
[02:40:43.441 --> 02:40:45.341]  They're flooding the West with open borders.
[02:40:45.381 --> 02:40:46.421]  They're destabilizing.
[02:40:46.841 --> 02:40:49.202]  They're taking a lot of problems of societal breakdown.
[02:40:50.470 --> 02:41:01.159]  Showing some bad cops, projecting it on to police in general, to create a revolution against the police that the feds will guide and control, that will then be used to federalize the police.
[02:41:01.319 --> 02:41:03.801]  And then that's an admitted strategy by Al Sharpton.
[02:41:04.482 --> 02:41:08.005]  I talked about it years ago, but he's gotten up on TV, we played the clips, and just admitted it.
[02:41:08.825 --> 02:41:09.906]  George Soros admits it.
[02:41:09.926 --> 02:41:11.407]  He's done this in other countries too.
[02:41:12.068 --> 02:41:12.608]  Like Ukraine.
[02:41:13.529 --> 02:41:16.171]  So we're in a very dangerous situation.
[02:41:17.472 --> 02:41:18.093]  And they're moving.
[02:41:19.656 --> 02:41:30.185]  And Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former top Reagan administration official, Wall Street Journal editor, concurred that yes, they're going to a new level of persecution, of whistleblowers, journalists.
[02:41:31.466 --> 02:41:33.568]  They are moving to go after the polls.
[02:41:33.608 --> 02:41:46.460]  They've indicted their chief of staff, a number two person, for giving money to a political candidate, which they then claim endorsed
[02:41:47.526 --> 02:41:47.986]  Rand Paul.
[02:41:49.647 --> 02:41:51.268]  They run political campaigns.
[02:41:51.708 --> 02:41:52.809]  They fund libertarians.
[02:41:53.229 --> 02:41:54.050]  They raise the money.
[02:41:54.550 --> 02:41:57.071]  This is how they've written the laws where the feds can interpret it.
[02:41:58.952 --> 02:42:03.875]  If you stick a stamp on sideways wire fraud, people have been indicted for that.
[02:42:05.136 --> 02:42:08.057]  So that's why when I ran for office for like a week, I started talking to lawyers and looking.
[02:42:08.277 --> 02:42:09.058]  I ran for state rep.
[02:42:09.078 --> 02:42:10.559]  I started looking at the lawyers.
[02:42:10.619 --> 02:42:11.959]  It was like, they'll just put me in jail.
[02:42:11.979 --> 02:42:12.900]  There's no way to follow this.
[02:42:16.226 --> 02:42:17.446]  That's where all this is going.
[02:42:17.647 --> 02:42:41.256]  And then, when in governments in history, when governments create new police units and put their political officers over them, that's because they know there's different camps in the FBI, different camps in the Federal Marshals, different camps in the Commerce Department, different camps in the SEC, FTC, and they can't get
[02:42:42.819 --> 02:42:49.462]  Those units to go and frame Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, Joseph Farah.
[02:42:49.522 --> 02:42:51.303]  I mean, these are people that are being targeted.
[02:42:52.604 --> 02:42:55.845]  Governor Abbott, his attorney general has been indicted.
[02:42:55.925 --> 02:42:57.146]  I told you about that before it happened.
[02:42:59.744 --> 02:43:04.826]  And I happen to know that the governor is honorable and is doing this because he cares about Texas and the country.
[02:43:05.126 --> 02:43:15.709]  I happen to know, Ron Paul, these people don't want to go up against these criminals, but they're men, they love their families, and they just will not bow to this evil.
[02:43:17.256 --> 02:43:22.760]  And they hope there's enough political pressure as they get indicted that people understand that this is like Nazi Germany.
[02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:24.361]  When Hitler started arresting people in 36, 37, 38.
[02:43:24.541 --> 02:43:26.022]  Then they start wars.
[02:43:26.142 --> 02:43:28.464]  Look what they're doing with Russia.
[02:43:28.864 --> 02:43:30.526]  Look how they're funding Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:43:32.307 --> 02:43:37.310]  And so they brought in, and this is all on the Justice Department website, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL.
[02:43:38.311 --> 02:43:39.912]  There's an hour and a half C-SPAN video of this.
[02:43:39.932 --> 02:43:41.153]  We're going to play some clips right now.
[02:43:41.173 --> 02:43:41.954]  We'll have more tomorrow.
[02:43:41.974 --> 02:43:43.415]  There's so much of it.
[02:43:46.798 --> 02:43:49.520]  And we just had an article just go up.
[02:43:49.560 --> 02:43:53.263]  DOJ official praises Southern Primary Law Center's work in combating domestic terrorism.
[02:43:54.224 --> 02:44:00.789]  SPLC says it has placed its groups, including conservative Christian groups, on its hate list based on their beliefs.
[02:44:01.609 --> 02:44:04.291]  That's actually a CNS news report.
[02:44:04.332 --> 02:44:07.634]  So we've been covering this and now some folks are actually covering it.
[02:44:08.435 --> 02:44:11.777]  But they say that they get their directives from the UN
[02:44:13.214 --> 02:44:14.735]  Obama administration and U.N.
[02:44:15.195 --> 02:44:18.196]  announced global police force to fight extremism in U.S.
[02:44:21.177 --> 02:44:22.658]  and then that was two weeks ago.
[02:44:22.678 --> 02:44:23.358]  This is today.
[02:44:23.378 --> 02:44:36.623]  Justice Department creates domestic terrorism unit outside of the FBI to liaison directly with your local police departments and then they're directed by the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL.
[02:44:37.694 --> 02:44:45.878]  Who put out literature to police departments saying if someone has a get us out of the UN sticker on their car, go ahead and arrest them.
[02:44:46.579 --> 02:44:47.879]  Chances are they're a terrorist.
[02:44:48.039 --> 02:44:48.620]  That's a quote.
[02:44:51.381 --> 02:44:55.263]  And they're arresting people for rebel flags in Georgia and charging them with terrorism.
[02:44:56.203 --> 02:45:01.446]  Saying the rebel flag hurt someone's feelings.
[02:45:01.566 --> 02:45:04.688]  I mean, this is Nazi Germany, this is Soviet Russia level stuff.
[02:45:05.526 --> 02:45:08.349]  The question is, are they going to roll it out big time?
[02:45:10.131 --> 02:45:17.140]  So, it's federalization of police, it's globalization of police, it's new special units that are purely political.
[02:45:18.570 --> 02:45:20.731]  It will accompany false flags to demonize us.
[02:45:20.971 --> 02:45:21.972]  It's very dangerous.
[02:45:22.352 --> 02:45:30.935]  Now, I've got five clips here, and it'll take at least five minutes to the next hour to get to all this when I hand the baton to Rob Doo, but let's go to the homegrown extremist part.
[02:45:31.236 --> 02:45:45.502]  This is at George Washington University, named after the founder, who they say, Associated Press, you can pull this up, founding fathers wouldn't be included in today's military, and George Washington would be seen as an extremist today and was a bad person.
[02:45:46.724 --> 02:45:48.105]  So they're at the university.
[02:45:48.965 --> 02:45:51.046]  They want to take down George Washington statues.
[02:45:51.106 --> 02:45:51.886]  That's been called for.
[02:45:53.347 --> 02:45:54.867]  They hate the American flag as well.
[02:45:56.508 --> 02:45:57.769]  These are extreme radicals.
[02:45:59.349 --> 02:46:00.730]  And they now run the show.
[02:46:00.810 --> 02:46:05.592]  And they're now going to be in all your local departments persecuting police that don't get on board with this.
[02:46:06.152 --> 02:46:08.373]  I mean, this is really, this is a takeover.
[02:46:10.274 --> 02:46:10.934]  I just got chills.
[02:46:12.096 --> 02:46:16.518]  And again, it's not saying it's going to happen next week or next month, it's just the rollout is intensifying.
[02:46:18.339 --> 02:46:20.259]  The good news is these people have been exposed.
[02:46:20.580 --> 02:46:26.742]  So they're cornered rats, they're going for everything with Hail Marys, but they got a chance to catch the ball in the end zone.
[02:46:26.802 --> 02:46:27.583]  I mean, they could win.
[02:46:28.403 --> 02:46:32.425]  This is like sudden death overtime NFL, folks.
[02:46:32.505 --> 02:46:35.306]  I mean, we're in the fight, but man, we are in a fight.
[02:46:36.698 --> 02:46:38.179]  Let's go ahead and go to the homegrown extremist.
[02:46:38.699 --> 02:46:40.460]  And again, Joe Biden's been at these meetings.
[02:46:40.560 --> 02:46:41.901]  It's got the Attorney General there.
[02:46:42.541 --> 02:46:47.144]  And it's truly sickening how they mix Islamic terror that they're funding in with Patriot groups.
[02:46:47.184 --> 02:46:47.524]  Here it is.
[02:46:48.703 --> 02:46:57.787]  So while we address that evolving international threat of violent extremism, we have not and cannot lose sight of the domestic terrorism threat posed by violent extremists.
[02:46:58.507 --> 02:47:03.449]  Terror and extremism do not always originate elsewhere or take place outside our borders.
[02:47:04.549 --> 02:47:15.794]  Homegrown violent extremists instead can be motivated by any viewpoint on a full spectrum of hate, anti-government views, racism, bigotry, anarchy, and other despicable beliefs.
[02:47:16.804 --> 02:47:20.867]  When it comes to hate and intolerance, there's no single ideology that governs.
[02:47:22.127 --> 02:47:26.991]  Now, in America, harboring extremist views is not itself a crime, nor should it be.
[02:47:27.271 --> 02:47:27.631]  Oh, really?
[02:47:27.731 --> 02:47:33.074]  And it is not the expression of a hateful ideology or association with a particular hateful group.
[02:47:33.755 --> 02:47:38.018]  What we do focus on is that line between speech and violence.
[02:47:38.298 --> 02:47:41.140]  And it's crossed too often, and it results in heartbreaking tragedy.
[02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:49.165]  The list includes plots and attacks on government buildings, businesses, synagogues, mosques, and other public infrastructure.
[02:47:49.685 --> 02:47:56.070]  It includes assassinations, planned assassinations of police officers, judges, civil rights figures, doctors, and others.
[02:47:56.950 --> 02:48:04.776]  It includes the stockpiling of illegal weapons, explosives and biological and chemical weapons, and killing sprees that have terrorized local communities.
[02:48:06.314 --> 02:48:15.104]  Looking back over the past few years, it is quite clear that domestic terrorists and homegrown violent extremists remain a clear and present danger here inside the United States.
[02:48:16.125 --> 02:48:28.118]  And as I said, we recognize that according to at least one study, more people have died in this country in attacks by domestic extremists than in attacks associated with international terrorist groups over the last, say, five or six years.
[02:48:29.597 --> 02:48:35.385]  As our Southern Poverty Law Center colleagues can attest, racial hatred motivates many of these violent extremist attacks.
[02:48:35.926 --> 02:48:42.035]  And the Attorney General noted this summer that these kinds of hate crimes are the original domestic terrorism.
[02:48:43.996 --> 02:48:49.580]  Among domestic extremist movements inside the United States, the white supremacists are among the most violent.
[02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:55.344]  The Charleston shooter who had a manifesto laying out a racist worldview is just one example.
[02:48:56.124 --> 02:49:01.688]  His actions followed deadly shooting sprees by white supremacists in Kansas, Wisconsin, and elsewhere.
[02:49:01.708 --> 02:49:06.071]  I've talked about the case of Kevin Harpham.
[02:49:07.336 --> 02:49:10.998]  And one where it was successfully disrupted, but we're not always so fortunate.
[02:49:11.239 --> 02:49:24.987]  And in August 2012, Wade Michael Page, who also espoused white supremacist and neo-Nazi views, fatally shot six people and wounded four others, including a responding police officer at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin.
[02:49:25.548 --> 02:49:30.511]  He acted alone, and he died in the course of the attacks with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
[02:49:31.803 --> 02:49:35.244]  We also see anti-government views triggering violence throughout America.
[02:49:36.044 --> 02:49:46.108]  As just one example, three militia members were recently sentenced... Notice they're getting, trying to talk white supremacists that are almost completely federal-run, mentally ill people, they wind up.
[02:49:47.611 --> 02:49:50.473]  To hateful rhetoric, to speech in America.
[02:49:50.973 --> 02:49:58.137]  So see that's where they're going with all this and arresting people that have rebel flags at parks and charging them with terrorism.
[02:49:58.437 --> 02:49:58.918]  Let's go back.
[02:49:59.878 --> 02:50:05.842]  Georgia for conspiring to use weapons of mass destructions in attacks against federal government buildings.
[02:50:06.782 --> 02:50:12.165]  They attempted to acquire explosives in early 2014 with the goal of destroying U.S.
[02:50:12.205 --> 02:50:17.287]  government infrastructure as part of a guerrilla warfare strategy to undermine the government of the United States.
[02:50:18.468 --> 02:50:25.291]  And more broadly, law enforcement agencies across the nation are concerned about the growth of the sovereign citizen movement.
[02:50:26.032 --> 02:50:26.832]  According to one 2014 study,
[02:50:30.245 --> 02:50:40.836]  State local and tribal local law enforcement officials considered sovereign citizens to be their top concern and it ranked above ISIL or Al Qaeda inspired extremists.
[02:50:40.977 --> 02:50:47.163]  And that's consistent with the conversations I've had with police departments across the country both in my time here and when I was at the FBI.
[02:50:48.601 --> 02:50:56.773]  These adherents to the so-called sovereign citizen ideology believe they don't have to answer to any government authority, including courts, taxing entities, or law enforcement.
[02:50:57.554 --> 02:51:05.045]  And although most sovereign citizens espouse these views lawfully, as they are entitled to do, some resort to violence.
[02:51:08.004 --> 02:51:18.615]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[02:51:18.895 --> 02:51:22.820]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[02:51:23.080 --> 02:51:24.902]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:25.242 --> 02:51:30.688]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:30.848 --> 02:51:40.637]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:51:40.877 --> 02:51:47.142]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:51:47.383 --> 02:51:50.705]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[02:51:50.725 --> 02:51:52.547]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:51:52.787 --> 02:51:55.890]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:51:55.930 --> 02:51:58.033]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[02:52:07.406 --> 02:52:10.830]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:52:11.611 --> 02:52:12.132]  It's true.
[02:52:12.252 --> 02:52:16.235]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:52:16.395 --> 02:52:18.216]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:52:18.797 --> 02:52:23.281]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:52:23.581 --> 02:52:36.171]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[02:52:47.198 --> 02:52:47.819]  Big Berkey.

[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:32.465]  That probably does kill about two cops a year.
[02:54:32.485 --> 02:54:33.447]  I've seen the numbers.
[02:54:34.008 --> 02:54:36.212]  That's all they show, police and training videos.
[02:54:36.272 --> 02:54:36.813]  End of the world.
[02:54:36.873 --> 02:54:37.835]  Oh, they're going to kill you any minute.
[02:54:41.280 --> 02:54:49.644]  And then meanwhile, this is the very Justice Department trying to federalize the police and has been caught running all the Trayvon Martin stuff, stirring everything up, on record.
[02:54:50.384 --> 02:54:53.266]  And funding radical Islamists to kill hundreds of thousands overseas.
[02:54:54.066 --> 02:54:56.167]  That's how radical this criminal government is.
[02:54:56.707 --> 02:55:01.330]  So let's go back to him talking about sovereign citizens, then he announces the domestic terrorism initiative.
[02:55:01.370 --> 02:55:01.670]  Here it is.
[02:55:02.466 --> 02:55:09.051]  More broadly, law enforcement agencies across the nation are concerned about the growth of the sovereign citizen movement.
[02:55:09.811 --> 02:55:14.534]  According to one 2014 study... I mean, can't they just be sovereign like the illegals?
[02:55:14.554 --> 02:55:24.541]  State, local, and tribal law enforcement officials considered sovereign citizens to be their top concern, and it ranked above ISIL or Al-Qaeda-inspired extremists.
[02:55:26.391 --> 02:55:29.233]  We've had a bunch of attacks at recruiting centers, shootings this year.
[02:55:29.534 --> 02:55:32.796]  They'll never say it's a radical Muslim because that's controlled media.
[02:55:33.977 --> 02:55:37.380]  And you just heard, ranking number one is the sovereign citizens.
[02:55:38.260 --> 02:55:40.002]  And that's just people that don't have any more money.
[02:55:40.022 --> 02:55:41.703]  They're out on a piece of property just hanging on.
[02:55:41.903 --> 02:55:42.824]  They're not homeless yet.
[02:55:43.164 --> 02:55:44.505]  This guy wants to make them homeless.
[02:55:44.726 --> 02:55:45.566]  They're bitter clingers.
[02:55:45.586 --> 02:55:46.187]  They're veterans.
[02:55:46.527 --> 02:55:47.328]  He hates their guts.
[02:55:48.817 --> 02:55:51.838]  And so, it's the number one threat is the Patriots.
[02:55:52.058 --> 02:55:56.320]  That's because they segue from sovereign citizen into anybody that's for guns, anything.
[02:55:56.640 --> 02:55:57.340]  Here, let's go back to it.
[02:55:57.821 --> 02:56:02.683]  ...I've had with police departments across the country, both in my time here and when I was at the FBI.
[02:56:02.703 --> 02:56:04.663]  But the illegals don't have to follow law either, right?
[02:56:04.703 --> 02:56:09.065]  ...to the so-called sovereign citizen ideology believe they don't have to answer to any government authority.
[02:56:09.105 --> 02:56:09.845]  What's impossible?
[02:56:10.426 --> 02:56:11.946]  No, unconstitutional authority.
[02:56:12.026 --> 02:56:13.747]  Are there some quacks out there that go too far?
[02:56:13.787 --> 02:56:14.007]  Yes.
[02:56:14.367 --> 02:56:15.968]  Most of them just know what they're talking about.
[02:56:16.769 --> 02:56:17.370]  And they're fed up.
[02:56:17.850 --> 02:56:20.753]  And they know the illegals are above the law, so they're not going to follow any of it.
[02:56:22.274 --> 02:56:32.044]  So you ignore all the laws with the illegals, bring them in, have the Justice Department complete the smuggling process, engage in all this racketeering, and then they got Eddie Haskell up here.
[02:56:32.064 --> 02:56:34.366]  It's like he's 12 years old.
[02:56:34.386 --> 02:56:38.310]  I mean, you people don't follow the law.
[02:56:38.850 --> 02:56:39.851]  Here's Obama right here.
[02:56:40.816 --> 02:56:46.440]  In the Washington Post, Obama weighs executive action on guns circumventing Congress, October 8th.
[02:56:46.680 --> 02:56:47.321]  What's that called?
[02:56:47.581 --> 02:56:48.462]  Not believing in the law?
[02:56:49.022 --> 02:56:50.103]  People are a sick joke.
[02:56:50.343 --> 02:56:50.984]  Let's go back to it.
[02:56:51.844 --> 02:56:53.726]  Taxing entities or law enforcement.
[02:56:54.506 --> 02:57:01.992]  And although most sovereign citizens espouse those views lawfully, as they are entitled to do, some resort to violence.
[02:57:04.946 --> 02:57:14.955]  Terry Nichols, the convicted accomplice in the Oklahoma City bombing, is believed by many to have viewed... I mean, you understand the former Attorney General was the Deputy Attorney General, his position before.
[02:57:15.636 --> 02:57:21.641]  Literally, the emails came out in the lawsuit saying, this is a D-Day level event, we've got to put everything on it to cover up what's happening.
[02:57:22.762 --> 02:57:30.129]  And the cover-up, he talks about in the emails, was his people there, with our eyewitnesses, loading the bombs.
[02:57:32.338 --> 02:57:35.883]  And so they can now point at us and say, we blew up Oklahoma City.
[02:57:36.044 --> 02:57:40.050]  Remember Rush Limbaugh, within 30 minutes, Bill Clinton said it was talk radio's fault.
[02:57:40.731 --> 02:57:42.934]  If they can take him down, they can take everybody else down.
[02:57:44.437 --> 02:57:46.760]  You understand how, folks, I know these people's M.O.
[02:57:47.717 --> 02:57:48.737]  I know how they operate.
[02:57:48.817 --> 02:57:49.698]  I know what they're going to do.
[02:57:50.018 --> 02:57:52.279]  And we're watching you, and we're not afraid.
[02:57:52.919 --> 02:57:54.320]  Go ahead and finish up with this guy.
[02:57:54.580 --> 02:57:56.781]  For the Sovereign Citizen Movement.
[02:57:57.081 --> 02:58:09.386]  And in 2010, Joseph and Jerry Kane, a father and son who identified with the Sovereign Citizen Movement, killed two police officers, and then themselves were killed in an ensuing shootout with police after a routine traffic stop.
[02:58:10.246 --> 02:58:21.654]  And in June 2014, Drudd and Amanda Miller, likely motivated by the sovereign anti-government ideology, were killed two Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Departments.
[02:58:22.334 --> 02:58:25.736]  They then went to a nearby Walmart and killed another innocent person.
[02:58:26.216 --> 02:58:29.559]  And during their attacks, they declared the beginning of a so-called revolution.
[02:58:30.882 --> 02:58:36.225]  So these attacks and other... By the way, they were death heads into the occult, into Satanism, into just being radical.
[02:58:36.545 --> 02:58:38.746]  And you blame us again for that.
[02:58:38.926 --> 02:58:39.486]  I was blamed.
[02:58:39.806 --> 02:58:40.747]  They said I made it happen.
[02:58:41.367 --> 02:58:41.987]  You know, in the news.
[02:58:42.167 --> 02:58:42.808]  So there you go.
[02:58:42.888 --> 02:58:43.328]  I'm the target.
[02:58:43.828 --> 02:58:44.428]  You're the target.
[02:58:44.488 --> 02:58:46.569]  We'll be back with more of this guy.
[02:58:46.589 --> 02:58:48.450]  I mean, he's just talking about sick.
[02:58:48.490 --> 02:58:50.651]  FourthHourInfoWars.com forward slash show.

[03:00:00.506 --> 03:00:03.148]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:10.655 --> 03:00:16.681]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:17.302 --> 03:00:20.325]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:22.347 --> 03:00:27.232]  So a massive new branch of law enforcement, they're not just arming the EPA and...
[03:00:27.893 --> 03:00:43.007]  The FDA with machine guns and armored vehicles and billions of bullets and power-grabbing land everywhere and just running around foaming at the mouth of the borders open, shutting off our power plants, just like a pack of 10 million demonic pink gremlins, you know, wrecking our infrastructure.
[03:00:43.768 --> 03:00:44.409]  Couldn't do more.
[03:00:46.010 --> 03:00:51.756]  Kaijus, you know, out of Pacific Rim are less destructive than these real-life destroyers of civilization.
[03:00:53.081 --> 03:00:54.242]  These miscreants.
[03:00:54.963 --> 03:01:01.770]  And now they have the announcement of their new domestic terrorism initiative, if you read all the literature, run by the Southern Poverty Law Center, basically.
[03:01:01.790 --> 03:01:06.975]  The ADL's in there, but the SPLC is the big dog.
[03:01:06.995 --> 03:01:09.478]  They did such a great job in Elohim City.
[03:01:11.620 --> 03:01:13.662]  So, let's go ahead and go back.
[03:01:13.802 --> 03:01:15.403]  A domestic terrorism initiative.
[03:01:15.704 --> 03:01:16.725]  Here is this announcement.
[03:01:18.055 --> 03:01:31.778]  This is a threat that requires as much as any other, if not more, not just a federal response, but working closely with police officers, district attorneys, local community officials, and members of the community who are eyes on the ground.
[03:01:33.812 --> 03:01:52.228]  At NSD, in order to ensure that we gain the benefits of the information and input coming in from all those different eyes on the ground, and in recognition of the growing number of domestic terrorism matters across the country and across all of the United States, we've created a new position.
[03:01:52.828 --> 03:01:56.871]  To assist in our important work in combating domestic terrorism.
[03:01:57.672 --> 03:02:06.798]  So just this week, I appointed a new Domestic Terrorism Council to serve as our main point of contact for US attorneys working on domestic terrorism matters.
[03:02:07.639 --> 03:02:09.220]  The new Domestic Terrorism Council
[03:02:09.620 --> 03:02:26.945]  We'll not only help ensure that domestic terrorism cases are properly coordinated, but we'll play a key role in our headquarters level efforts to identify trends to help shape our national strategy and to analyze legal gaps for enhancements required to ensure that we can combat these threats.
[03:02:27.885 --> 03:02:41.549]  The new council will also play an important role in plugging into the Domestic Terrorism Executive Council by providing its members with overviews of cases and trends from around the country to provide direction to that group.
[03:02:43.430 --> 03:02:47.315]  Our collective objective is to disrupt and prevent terrorist attacks.
[03:02:47.355 --> 03:02:48.937]  It's to stop the states from saving the country.
[03:02:48.957 --> 03:02:51.981]  It's not a prosecution, although they are sometimes necessary.
[03:02:52.502 --> 03:02:57.168]  It's that we see the attack prevented, the life saved, the injury that never occurs.
[03:02:57.188 --> 03:02:59.931]  They'll stop some fake attacks on mentally ill people and they'll carry out their own.
[03:03:00.774 --> 03:03:01.054]  Oh, sure.
[03:03:17.448 --> 03:03:27.255]  But we are obligated to investigate extremist groups and individuals when we have reason to believe that they're involved in the commission of a federal crime, including crimes of violence.
[03:03:27.355 --> 03:03:28.476]  And Santa Claus is real?
[03:03:28.736 --> 03:03:39.903]  We need to utilize proactive enforcement tools and investigative techniques, including undercover operations, the use of confidential informants, and other statutory authorities.
[03:03:40.144 --> 03:03:42.285]  All these creepy power-tripping anti-Americans.
[03:03:43.226 --> 03:03:43.326]  Ugh.
[03:03:44.790 --> 03:03:46.455]  I'm going to throw up, I tell you.
[03:03:46.495 --> 03:03:47.818]  Let's go out to break with one more clip.
[03:03:47.839 --> 03:03:49.383]  The Threat of Influence of Internet.
[03:03:49.423 --> 03:03:49.764]  Here it is.
[03:03:49.784 --> 03:03:50.105]  Play that.
[03:03:50.495 --> 03:03:52.456]  Well, we can only track threats that we can see.
[03:03:53.417 --> 03:04:03.964]  With the explosive use of social media and encrypted communications, those inspired to violence by messages of hate, we run the risk that we will see less, just as the bad guys are seeing more.
[03:04:04.284 --> 03:04:05.445]  They call free speech messages of hate.
[03:04:05.465 --> 03:04:20.315]  Social media in this space can also create, for an extreme segment of our society, a sort of radicalization echo chamber, which each of their own calls for extremist propaganda or violence echo and support the others.
[03:04:20.595 --> 03:04:25.117]  I know that's a phenomenon, in particular Southern Poverty Law Center has analyzed closely.
[03:04:26.037 --> 03:04:28.678]  Oh, he's analyzed it closely, let me tell you.
[03:04:28.798 --> 03:04:41.063]  So as service providers, we provide a service that does so much good and has so many legitimate business, entertainment purposes and is the way most of our children now are communicating and playing day-to-day.
[03:04:41.503 --> 03:04:47.325]  Just as it provides those good things, they also need to take responsibility for how their services can be abused.
[03:04:47.665 --> 03:04:50.187]  Yeah, see him censor like Zuckerberg's doing.
[03:04:50.687 --> 03:04:54.370]  This guy's the perfect sociopath globalist.
[03:04:54.410 --> 03:04:55.511]  Just real non-threatening.
[03:04:55.591 --> 03:04:57.013]  Oh, hi, I'm that little suit.
[03:04:58.874 --> 03:04:59.855]  Meanwhile, I close doors.
[03:04:59.875 --> 03:05:01.676]  Yeah, get these Americans.
[03:05:02.877 --> 03:05:03.598]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:03.618 --> 03:05:04.018]  Stay with us.
[03:05:04.038 --> 03:05:05.620]  I'm going to continue on with the Rob News straight ahead.
[03:05:08.530 --> 03:05:17.417]  In yet another land grab, the BLM, the Bureau of Land Management, is ignoring the real estate title given by the state of Texas 74 years ago to a farmer.
[03:05:17.917 --> 03:05:28.045]  Now the same bureaucracy that has ignored property rights for ranchers like Cliven Bundy in Nevada, ignored property rights for miners in Oregon and elsewhere, is coming after the property of a Texas farmer.
[03:05:28.305 --> 03:05:32.429]  The BLM has decided they will move the boundary, take half his land and his house.
[03:05:33.129 --> 03:05:35.590]  Congress has allowed bureaucracies to grow unchecked.
[03:05:35.870 --> 03:05:45.072]  Because Congress doesn't like to pass laws, they have abdicated their constitutional duty to bureaucracies, who not only write the law, but often act as their own police force and run their own court.
[03:05:45.712 --> 03:05:48.353]  No one in either party in Washington wants to change it.
[03:05:49.153 --> 03:06:01.736]  These bureaucracies will destroy every last remnant of your God-given, constitutionally protected rights, including your property rights, unless they are stopped by you, by the people, at the state and the local level.

[03:08:04.447 --> 03:08:12.033]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:12.594 --> 03:08:15.476]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:17.918 --> 03:08:19.419]  It is key to understand
[03:08:20.859 --> 03:08:34.527]  But the globalists are waging war to take over the West by opening up the borders, bringing in masses of immigrants, and then filling those immigrants full of hate of the people that are already in the country, and that they're not getting enough.
[03:08:36.252 --> 03:08:38.633]  And we've got mainstream news articles today.
[03:08:38.693 --> 03:08:40.793]  Here's RT, Associated Press, you name it.
[03:08:41.254 --> 03:08:46.935]  German parents outraged over school children asked to make beds cooked for refugees.
[03:08:47.516 --> 03:08:52.397]  Retirees are being thrown out of government-subsidized housing to make way for the quote, refugees.
[03:08:54.758 --> 03:09:00.980]  In England, the Express News reports refugees taunt police with selfies showing stolen goods, but they can't be arrested.
[03:09:04.690 --> 03:09:08.713]  And then this latest article with video at Infowars.com.
[03:09:08.773 --> 03:09:10.674]  This ties into what I'm about to get into with Rob Do.
[03:09:11.275 --> 03:09:15.918]  Governor tells residents of Germantown about to accept, quote, migrants.
[03:09:16.518 --> 03:09:18.080]  If you don't like it, leave.
[03:09:19.581 --> 03:09:25.104]  While another town of just 4,000 residents prepares to accept 3,000 migrants.
[03:09:25.745 --> 03:09:31.849]  Sweden has set up an airline in the Middle East to fly the illegals in free.
[03:09:33.396 --> 03:09:36.002]  So it's not like they have a migrant crisis and they can't handle it.
[03:09:36.543 --> 03:09:37.425]  They want it.
[03:09:38.367 --> 03:09:40.693]  And over 80% now, they admit, are...
[03:09:41.738 --> 03:09:42.758]  Military-age men.
[03:09:42.818 --> 03:09:43.819]  These are not refugees.
[03:09:43.879 --> 03:09:52.222]  In fact, there was an article yesterday on Infowars.com about this, and it showed real refugees from Syria, a bunch of women and children mainly, with old people.
[03:09:52.242 --> 03:09:57.023]  And then it shows the new refugees, and they get off in our military.
[03:09:57.063 --> 03:09:58.404]  They line up military ranks.
[03:09:58.984 --> 03:10:07.527]  They're from a bunch of different countries, and it is a deal with Europe, I guess, to sell out and start a caliphate up.
[03:10:09.315 --> 03:10:13.057]  And the word's gone out to the big imam of Jerusalem, and he says all that in speeches?
[03:10:13.117 --> 03:10:18.201]  I mean... I gotta hand it to the socialists on the left and the big banks.
[03:10:18.261 --> 03:10:21.022]  I mean, they really are hardcore.
[03:10:21.603 --> 03:10:23.584]  I mean, they are HARDCORE.
[03:10:25.105 --> 03:10:34.831]  And they're now announcing in Germany, and they're arresting you if you criticize it, a regional governor told residents of a municipality in Germany that if they didn't embrace the arrival of hundreds of new immigrants, they should leave.
[03:10:36.323 --> 03:10:39.605]  That's what Governor Cuomo said in New York, if you're pro-life or pro-gun, get out of the state.
[03:10:39.665 --> 03:10:40.285]  People said, are you joking?
[03:10:40.305 --> 03:10:41.626]  He said, no, get out of here!
[03:10:41.926 --> 03:10:42.727]  You're not welcome!
[03:10:45.289 --> 03:10:51.052]  The municipality of Lowenfeld, am I pronouncing that right, has a population of 13,500.
[03:10:51.332 --> 03:10:54.915]  During a town hall meeting, they've already received thousands.
[03:10:54.975 --> 03:10:59.798]  Residents were suddenly informed that 400 new migrants, that's invaders, would be arriving the very next day.
[03:11:00.697 --> 03:11:04.138]  Regional Governor Walter Lubeck told the, is that right?
[03:11:04.538 --> 03:11:06.058]  Lubeck?
[03:11:06.639 --> 03:11:09.199]  How do you say that?
[03:11:09.399 --> 03:11:09.839]  Lubeck.
[03:11:10.920 --> 03:11:19.202]  Told the attendees that people who were not happy with the influx of migrants could simply vacate the area, remarking, quote, if you don't like it, you can leave.
[03:11:19.982 --> 03:11:21.302]  We have, as Germans, freedom.
[03:11:21.422 --> 03:11:22.763]  You're free to leave if you don't agree.
[03:11:23.103 --> 03:11:23.363]  Really?
[03:11:23.403 --> 03:11:24.283]  Go to another town?
[03:11:25.203 --> 03:11:27.844]  One of the audience members reacts by commenting, I can't believe it.
[03:11:28.484 --> 03:11:29.805]  Piss off, get out of here.
[03:11:29.885 --> 03:11:31.406]  The rest of the crowd boos loudly.
[03:11:31.686 --> 03:11:32.647]  But they don't care.
[03:11:32.687 --> 03:11:34.368]  They're all going to get EU jobs.
[03:11:34.928 --> 03:11:42.693]  The more they break Germany, the more they break Spain, the more they break Portugal, the more they break Greece, the more they bankrupt it, the more they get rewarded.
[03:11:42.753 --> 03:11:45.694]  It's all about hardcore in your face.
[03:11:46.315 --> 03:11:49.136]  CNN says, ban the term he and she.
[03:11:49.697 --> 03:11:50.797]  It's the new n-word.
[03:11:50.817 --> 03:11:51.778]  They actually say that.
[03:11:52.398 --> 03:11:53.679]  That's on Infowars.com.
[03:11:55.200 --> 03:11:56.241]  And they're never going to stop.
[03:11:56.401 --> 03:11:57.942]  They're not going to stop.
[03:11:58.933 --> 03:11:59.753]  They're not crazy.
[03:11:59.833 --> 03:12:00.853]  It's psych warfare.
[03:12:01.414 --> 03:12:01.854]  On record.
[03:12:04.134 --> 03:12:06.175]  Now, you criticize all this.
[03:12:06.215 --> 03:12:11.276]  The Justice Department is federalizing the local police and saying, you're the number one threat.
[03:12:12.016 --> 03:12:13.076]  We're going to surveil you.
[03:12:13.116 --> 03:12:13.937]  We're going to watch you.
[03:12:13.977 --> 03:12:14.917]  We're going to come after you.
[03:12:16.857 --> 03:12:18.658]  Then they go to the Strong Cities Network.
[03:12:19.551 --> 03:12:21.574]  This is from yesterday at the Justice Department.
[03:12:21.594 --> 03:12:22.876]  There's almost no coverage of this.
[03:12:23.557 --> 03:12:24.658]  We're getting articles right now.
[03:12:24.719 --> 03:12:27.423]  And look, I don't want to be the only ones reporting it.
[03:12:27.443 --> 03:12:31.589]  I'm reporting all this before we have articles out, hoping other people pick up on it.
[03:12:32.742 --> 03:12:34.323]  And I'm doing the analysis for people.
[03:12:34.664 --> 03:12:36.505]  That's why MSNBC hates me so much.
[03:12:36.545 --> 03:12:37.206]  I'm not bragging.
[03:12:37.266 --> 03:12:38.046]  I've studied this, though.
[03:12:38.367 --> 03:12:39.628]  They go, look at Congress.
[03:12:40.108 --> 03:12:40.929]  Chairman of committees.
[03:12:40.949 --> 03:12:42.490]  Get their talking points from Alex Jones.
[03:12:43.191 --> 03:12:43.771]  And that's true.
[03:12:44.231 --> 03:12:45.272]  They're not talking points.
[03:12:45.633 --> 03:12:46.593]  I've done the homework.
[03:12:47.074 --> 03:12:47.995]  I've done the interviews.
[03:12:48.055 --> 03:12:48.735]  Thousands of them.
[03:12:49.035 --> 03:12:49.696]  I've been there.
[03:12:49.776 --> 03:12:50.377]  I've studied it.
[03:12:50.497 --> 03:12:51.297]  I know their plan.
[03:12:52.018 --> 03:12:54.560]  And I'm not sitting on it like I've got a golden egg.
[03:12:54.620 --> 03:12:55.401]  It's a hand grenade.
[03:12:55.901 --> 03:12:57.803]  I'm saying we need everybody
[03:12:59.241 --> 03:13:05.650]  You have to realize how diabolical, premeditated, and evil this is, and they want tyranny to get rid of the free market and make us poor.
[03:13:06.591 --> 03:13:10.476]  Even if you're cynical and don't care about freedom, this is going to hurt your bottom line.
[03:13:10.517 --> 03:13:11.298]  This is bad!
[03:13:14.977 --> 03:13:27.465]  So here they are, the Strong Cities Network, which is a UN initiative through the Justice Department, federalizing police, setting up spies, funding leftist groups, and putting people on the police review boards.
[03:13:27.805 --> 03:13:29.366]  And you're like, well there's some bad cops.
[03:13:29.546 --> 03:13:31.687]  Yeah, that's federal training, that's globalism.
[03:13:32.188 --> 03:13:35.550]  But you don't fix it by putting Satan over it.
[03:13:39.352 --> 03:13:40.233]  This is UN.
[03:13:40.673 --> 03:13:43.215]  Notice the UN's here like, your borders aren't open enough.
[03:13:44.110 --> 03:13:45.431]  This is all global government.
[03:13:45.931 --> 03:13:46.591]  TPP.
[03:13:46.671 --> 03:13:47.212]  World Treaty.
[03:13:47.252 --> 03:13:47.632]  Here it is.
[03:13:48.532 --> 03:13:58.197]  The Attorney General, when she was out attending the United Nations General Assembly events, hosted her own launch of a Strong Cities Network.
[03:13:58.357 --> 03:14:04.120]  And that's the first ever network of city leaders around the world involved in building communities.
[03:14:04.140 --> 03:14:05.201]  Circumventing states.
[03:14:05.521 --> 03:14:11.544]  The network was created in recognition of the key role of local communities in combating violent extremism.
[03:14:11.584 --> 03:14:12.244]  Hit pause.
[03:14:12.504 --> 03:14:13.225]  Back it up ten seconds.
[03:14:13.245 --> 03:14:13.365]  See?
[03:14:14.366 --> 03:14:19.290]  This strategy's gone on, it's called menialization for over 60 years, mainly in third world countries that are weak.
[03:14:20.951 --> 03:14:26.276]  Where they say IMF, World Bank money will come in, but you've got to put the UN in charge of how it's distributed, and then they distribute it back to their own companies.
[03:14:27.477 --> 03:14:40.147]  This is billions, they're saying 2 billion the first year on this, in the US alone, to fly everybody around to UN meetings, steak dinners, prostitutes, you know, all the regular stuff, to corrupt them.
[03:14:41.109 --> 03:14:41.909]  To get dirt on them.
[03:14:42.089 --> 03:14:42.810]  To give them deals.
[03:14:42.890 --> 03:14:44.090]  It's an intelligence operation.
[03:14:44.991 --> 03:14:51.253]  And then bring them back and basically set them up in charge over the city and following UN edicts.
[03:14:52.193 --> 03:14:53.534]  And that's what it's announced.
[03:14:53.614 --> 03:14:54.174]  It's UN.
[03:14:54.214 --> 03:14:54.614]  Here it is.
[03:14:55.555 --> 03:15:04.959]  The network was created in recognition of the key role of local communities in combating violent extremism and the need for more than a top-down approach.
[03:15:05.319 --> 03:15:07.880]  Instead, from an approach that built up from the communities.
[03:15:08.260 --> 03:15:09.180]  See, everything's inverse here.
[03:15:12.230 --> 03:15:13.672]  He says, oh, this is bottom-up.
[03:15:13.712 --> 03:15:14.133]  No, it's not.
[03:15:14.193 --> 03:15:22.726]  It's international, and then it's directed down to the bottom and circumvents the national and state government with the occupier traders shitting in their quarterbacking.
[03:15:22.826 --> 03:15:23.287]  Let's go back.
[03:15:24.209 --> 03:15:24.970]  Well, you partner with ISIS?
[03:15:44.457 --> 03:15:54.441]  Community members are often best positioned to identify and relate to individuals who've begun on a path of violent extremism because they see things that we just don't see in law enforcement.
[03:15:55.221 --> 03:16:09.727]  In the United States, according to one study, in 80% of the international terrorism-inspired cases inside the United States, there was a connection, there was a third-party bystander
[03:16:10.467 --> 03:16:14.289]  Who was in a position to see the radicalization taking place.
[03:16:14.909 --> 03:16:19.892]  But in over half of those cases, that person who saw it taking place did nothing to intervene.
[03:16:20.852 --> 03:16:31.798]  If we could simply increase the number of those witnesses who take action to help us stop that path to radicalization, I think it could reduce the number of lives lost to terrorist attacks here.
[03:16:31.918 --> 03:16:32.358]  Oh, that's good.
[03:16:32.879 --> 03:16:36.240]  So what he's saying is we're going to help with the community people watching.
[03:16:36.480 --> 03:16:38.682]  These are international spies in your town.
[03:16:39.582 --> 03:16:41.763]  And then what they do is they radicalize leftists.
[03:16:42.083 --> 03:16:43.444]  We've gone to the Police Review Board.
[03:16:43.784 --> 03:16:47.906]  We've had our people in there that folks don't know what they look like videotaping this stuff.
[03:16:47.946 --> 03:16:48.666]  Three different meetings.
[03:16:48.686 --> 03:16:49.887]  We're going to put a report out.
[03:16:50.387 --> 03:16:53.288]  There's actual, the majority are Maoist and Stalinist.
[03:16:53.749 --> 03:16:55.950]  And then they've got all these young people they order to go out.
[03:16:56.250 --> 03:16:59.791]  And then they show up at our pro-life demonstration saying they love Satan, kill everybody.
[03:17:00.252 --> 03:17:02.133]  And then they show up at other events saying kill the pigs.
[03:17:02.533 --> 03:17:07.175]  And then they're getting ready to put more of these people on the new Police Review Board.
[03:17:08.646 --> 03:17:16.129]  Where I live, literal green, I mean, you know, like translucent green skin, you know, scum.
[03:17:18.090 --> 03:17:20.671]  I say green skin because people actually have like greenish white skin.
[03:17:20.891 --> 03:17:21.732]  That's how evil they are.
[03:17:22.052 --> 03:17:23.333]  They physically look like ghouls.
[03:17:25.474 --> 03:17:26.614]  And they're showing up.
[03:17:28.615 --> 03:17:31.496]  And we go to these events and they're getting orders from UT people.
[03:17:32.337 --> 03:17:33.597]  And then they have UN support.
[03:17:33.657 --> 03:17:35.238]  I mean, this is organized.
[03:17:36.471 --> 03:17:40.412]  I just cannot believe that we are overrun by this much scum.
[03:17:41.093 --> 03:17:44.654]  There's other clips, a definition of codebook for domestic terrorism.
[03:17:44.674 --> 03:17:46.074]  I'm going to get to this tomorrow.
[03:17:46.154 --> 03:17:47.775]  I want to go to Rob Dewey, who's about to take over.
[03:17:47.795 --> 03:17:51.256]  I think we've got a big whistleblower coming up from Merck.
[03:17:51.416 --> 03:17:58.559]  And as scary as all this is, the good news is, as Dr. Roberts said, the world is seeing that we have evil people running our country.
[03:17:59.039 --> 03:18:12.465]  And so the deception's not working anymore, Rob, but I tell you, to still see them move to indict Ron Paul and Rand Paul, and that's what all this is, with Jesse Benton and others being indicted for nothing, it really shows you that this is, we are two minutes to midnight.
[03:18:13.084 --> 03:18:16.045]  Right, and I like what Dr. Roberts said today.
[03:18:16.185 --> 03:18:18.927]  As a brave man can only die once, a coward dies a thousand deaths.
[03:18:19.047 --> 03:18:22.828]  And as long as we stand up and fight, yeah, maybe they will kill us.
[03:18:22.908 --> 03:18:24.969]  Maybe something will happen, but they can only do it once.
[03:18:25.269 --> 03:18:28.211]  And then whatever you've done is what you're going to leave behind.
[03:18:28.291 --> 03:18:29.651]  So you have to act now.
[03:18:29.911 --> 03:18:30.792]  You have to stand up.
[03:18:31.592 --> 03:18:32.633]  I have a great picture.
[03:18:33.114 --> 03:18:34.495]  Joe just texted me.
[03:18:34.535 --> 03:18:39.018]  Joe Biggs out there with a good group of citizens out there wanting Hillary to go to prison.
[03:18:39.338 --> 03:18:40.359]  There it is on my phone.
[03:18:40.379 --> 03:18:41.600]  I'm going to tweet that out in a bit.
[03:18:41.640 --> 03:18:43.362]  But that's the kind of action we need.
[03:18:43.382 --> 03:18:49.246]  We need people to stand up to tyrants whenever they come into your town and city and let people know that we're not going to take it anymore.
[03:18:49.386 --> 03:18:49.867]  It's a fight.
[03:18:49.907 --> 03:18:54.010]  They want to run around behind the scenes, demonize us, false flag us, frame us, set us up.
[03:18:54.550 --> 03:18:56.272]  And we're not going to get on our knees.
[03:18:56.352 --> 03:18:57.773]  We're not going to go quietly in the night.
[03:18:57.813 --> 03:18:59.574]  We're going to fight as hard as we can.
[03:19:00.695 --> 03:19:03.276]  It's just, it's still really hard to believe, but it happened.
[03:19:03.296 --> 03:19:07.979]  I mean, we really have a crop of sinister people that have it out for everybody in charge.
[03:19:08.319 --> 03:19:13.461]  And the good thing is, yeah, we do have a big target on our back, but that also lets us get a lot of information out.
[03:19:13.501 --> 03:19:15.302]  So we're able to spread our information out.
[03:19:15.342 --> 03:19:16.242]  People are picking it up.
[03:19:16.623 --> 03:19:20.344]  It's getting, I mean, InfoWars is growing exponentially, and I love to see that.
[03:19:20.785 --> 03:19:23.426]  And with this whistleblower that we're going to have in today, Brandy Vaughn.
[03:19:23.926 --> 03:19:27.969]  She's, I was just in the hallway talking to her, Alex, and I was talking, she goes, what do you want to talk about?
[03:19:28.009 --> 03:19:29.791]  I said, well, I covered the vitamin K shot on Monday.
[03:19:29.811 --> 03:19:32.573]  She goes, ooh, ooh, wait till you see what they're putting in it now.
[03:19:33.113 --> 03:19:39.378]  Okay, because I have on tape a pediatrician telling me there's nothing bad in it, just a little bit of alcohol, just a little bit of alcohol.
[03:19:39.698 --> 03:19:42.341]  No, there's other things in it, and we're going to go over that coming up.
[03:19:43.081 --> 03:19:44.401]  And she's a whistleblower on Merck.
[03:19:44.421 --> 03:19:45.262]  I didn't know she was here.
[03:19:45.342 --> 03:19:45.922]  That's big.
[03:19:46.002 --> 03:19:46.402]  She's here.
[03:19:46.542 --> 03:19:48.082]  Yeah, she used to be a sales rep for Merck.
[03:19:48.102 --> 03:19:49.343]  She was a Vioxx sales rep.
[03:19:49.423 --> 03:19:50.423]  Now it's been national news.
[03:19:50.503 --> 03:19:52.003]  I just didn't know that she was in studio.
[03:19:52.083 --> 03:19:52.383]  Wow.
[03:19:52.403 --> 03:19:54.264]  Well, I'm gonna hand the baton to you.
[03:19:54.504 --> 03:19:56.564]  And, uh, you got 40 minutes coming up.
[03:19:56.764 --> 03:19:58.285]  Folks, call your friends and family.

[03:23:07.843 --> 03:23:12.085]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[03:23:12.266 --> 03:23:16.168]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[03:23:16.328 --> 03:23:20.550]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[03:23:23.692 --> 03:23:28.717]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[03:23:28.917 --> 03:23:37.445]  If you want to boost your Omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[03:23:40.828 --> 03:23:41.048]  I think so.
[03:24:25.704 --> 03:24:30.766]  We are back on the fourth hour of Overdrive with the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:30.826 --> 03:24:35.948]  I'm your host Rob Doo and I have a very special guest we're gonna go to in one quick second.
[03:24:36.809 --> 03:24:39.630]  She's a whistleblower from Merck Pharmaceuticals.
[03:24:39.650 --> 03:24:41.550]  She used to work there selling Vioxx.
[03:24:41.690 --> 03:24:42.531]  She was a sales rep.
[03:24:43.471 --> 03:24:50.313]  And now she's come out and I've got some, I was talking to her in the hall, her name is Brandy Vaughn, and she said, what do you want to cover?
[03:24:50.353 --> 03:24:54.955]  I said, well, you know, on Monday I covered the vitamin K shot and how the pediatricians don't want to give you the oral.
[03:24:55.015 --> 03:24:56.335]  They were pushing that shot.
[03:24:57.116 --> 03:25:00.877]  And she goes, oh, I've got some great, some images that you want to see, that you want to see.
[03:25:00.917 --> 03:25:03.698]  But first, but right before we get to that, I want to go over this article.
[03:25:03.718 --> 03:25:04.718]  This is from the Denver Post.
[03:25:05.418 --> 03:25:07.999]  Fight brewing between feds and kombucha tea makers.
[03:25:08.039 --> 03:25:09.480]  Now, what does that have to do with vaccines?
[03:25:09.600 --> 03:25:09.780]  Well,
[03:25:10.740 --> 03:25:12.522]  Basically, what's going on is the U.S.
[03:25:12.642 --> 03:25:18.747]  alcohol, tobacco, and firearms agents are worried about how much alcohol is in kombucha.
[03:25:19.668 --> 03:25:20.849]  And for years, U.S.
[03:25:21.229 --> 03:25:26.314]  Alcohol, Tobacco, Tax, and Trade Bureau have monitored kombucha makers nationwide for violations of federal alcohol rules.
[03:25:26.754 --> 03:25:30.578]  A product with more than 0.5% alcohol by volume must be labeled as such.
[03:25:31.397 --> 03:25:38.021]  And it's critical that customers have that information for health, religious, or some other reason such as childhood consumption.
[03:25:38.422 --> 03:25:45.346]  Well, let's look at the right here, guys, on the insert for Merck Vitamin K Shot.
[03:25:45.687 --> 03:25:52.932]  Oh, it's got .9% alcohol in it, yet they want to inject that into little babies, and there's not a big deal about it, yet we've got a whole
[03:25:53.692 --> 03:26:02.902]  Federal bureaucracy ready to go after people for making kombucha, something that's really good for you and something that you should be drinking if you're not drinking it already.
[03:26:02.982 --> 03:26:04.483]  I think it comes from Russia.
[03:26:04.744 --> 03:26:08.367]  There's villages in Russia where everybody lives to be a hundred and they all drink kombucha.
[03:26:09.148 --> 03:26:12.310]  So, at least that's what I've been told by the hippies out there that drink the kombucha.
[03:26:12.610 --> 03:26:16.012]  So, Brandy Vaughn, welcome to the Alex Jones Show Overdrive Hour.
[03:26:16.032 --> 03:26:17.552]  Thank you for having me here.
[03:26:18.753 --> 03:26:19.753]  I'm so glad you came.
[03:26:20.914 --> 03:26:23.195]  And you're going to be on with Leanne McAdoo tomorrow.
[03:26:23.215 --> 03:26:24.156]  We're going to tape another segment.
[03:26:24.176 --> 03:26:27.117]  And we're going to take your calls, actually, coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[03:26:27.137 --> 03:26:27.357]  So, 800-259-9231.
[03:26:27.377 --> 03:26:27.417]  800-259-9231.
[03:26:27.437 --> 03:26:28.278]  Vaccine questions only, please.
[03:26:28.318 --> 03:26:29.779]  Nothing about pyramids or meteorites coming to hit us.
[03:26:29.799 --> 03:26:30.019]  Thank you.
[03:26:39.203 --> 03:26:42.406]  But getting into the vitamin K shot, I talked to you about that.
[03:26:42.426 --> 03:26:46.829]  You said, oh wait, I've got two insert packages that show what?
[03:26:46.909 --> 03:26:47.810]  What are we going to see here?
[03:26:48.591 --> 03:27:04.983]  Well, I thought it was interesting that you brought that up because I was just sent this week some photos from a nurse who took photos of the actual box that the vitamin K shot comes in, as well as the different vials.
[03:27:05.043 --> 03:27:06.585]  So there's two different makers.
[03:27:07.906 --> 03:27:23.642]  Well I'm sure there's more than that but these are the two popular ones that they were giving in her hospital and as you'll see one of the photos shows that it says contains no more than 100 or actually this is one this one says the active ingredient in it is polysorbate 80.
[03:27:23.782 --> 03:27:24.062]  Right.
[03:27:24.863 --> 03:27:30.269]  And that is linked to infertility strongly linked as well as to autoimmune issues and all sorts of things.
[03:27:30.609 --> 03:27:32.510]  That's an additive they put in coloring as well.
[03:27:32.590 --> 03:27:32.910]  It is.
[03:27:32.950 --> 03:27:34.551]  And it's really bad for people.
[03:27:34.671 --> 03:27:36.372]  It's in a lot of other vaccines as well.
[03:27:36.412 --> 03:27:38.053]  It's not just the vitamin K shot.
[03:27:38.073 --> 03:27:38.213]  Right.
[03:27:38.233 --> 03:27:41.614]  But I have on tape my pediatrician telling me it's very safe.
[03:27:41.714 --> 03:27:42.935]  The ingredients are no big deal.
[03:27:43.015 --> 03:27:48.758]  It's got a little bit of alcohol in it for preservation and some castor oil and the vitamin K. And that's about it.
[03:27:48.858 --> 03:27:51.859]  But as you can see there, that one's got polysorbate 80.
[03:27:51.919 --> 03:27:53.300]  Now the other one is even worse.
[03:27:53.820 --> 03:28:03.824]  Yes, and like you mentioned, a lot of doctors are telling new mothers, oh, it's just vitamin K and saline.
[03:28:03.864 --> 03:28:04.624]  It's very safe.
[03:28:04.924 --> 03:28:06.145]  There's nothing dangerous in it.
[03:28:06.685 --> 03:28:10.426]  And clearly, either they're not telling the truth or they're not being told the truth.
[03:28:11.106 --> 03:28:14.668]  So the second picture is actually the vial of the vitamin K shot.
[03:28:15.428 --> 03:28:21.190]  And as you can read on the side, it says no more than 100 micrograms per liter of aluminum.
[03:28:23.411 --> 03:28:32.475]  This is a little aluminum for the newborn to help think and process information better, to help maybe with breastfeeding or something like that.
[03:28:32.735 --> 03:28:32.995]  Yes.
[03:28:33.115 --> 03:28:37.457]  And then on top of that, you've got the the MMR that they like to shoot into them and the second day.
[03:28:37.837 --> 03:28:42.579]  That's actually the Hep B vaccine and it has 250 micrograms of aluminum.
[03:28:42.859 --> 03:28:47.701]  So babies, newborn babies right out of the gate are getting 350 micrograms of aluminum.
[03:28:47.981 --> 03:28:52.163]  And this is a toxin, a known neurotoxin that should not be in our bodies in any amount.
[03:28:52.303 --> 03:28:52.463]  Right.
[03:28:52.703 --> 03:29:05.855]  It's linked to breast cancer, it's linked to Alzheimer's, it's linked to a lot of neurological issues as well as gut issues because the brain and the gut are linked through the lymphatic system and this just does not belong in our babies.
[03:29:05.895 --> 03:29:06.676]  There's no reason.
[03:29:07.757 --> 03:29:20.568]  That we should be shooting our babies unless you want to cause problems down the road, which is what I firmly believe is what the what the purpose of all these vaccines in this many amounts over and over again, especially in young babies is causing.
[03:29:20.929 --> 03:29:25.513]  It's causing people to be lifelong patients of the pharmaceutical companies so they could help with ADHD asthma.
[03:29:25.553 --> 03:29:26.494]  Hey, we got a pill for that.
[03:29:26.854 --> 03:29:28.496]  We're ready to help you right now.
[03:29:29.016 --> 03:29:29.857]  I mean, it's totally crazy.
[03:29:29.877 --> 03:29:31.559]  We're going to take some calls next segment.
[03:29:31.659 --> 03:29:33.801]  We're just scratching the surface of what's going on.
[03:29:33.842 --> 03:29:38.406]  I've got whistleblower Brandy Vaughn used to work for Mooc Pharmaceuticals.
[03:29:38.547 --> 03:29:39.588]  Mooc Pharmaceuticals.
[03:29:39.628 --> 03:29:42.651]  Just horrible people out there that want to make sure you're safe and effective.
[03:29:43.132 --> 03:29:45.194]  This is Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:29:45.214 --> 03:29:47.236]  This is the Alex Jones Show Overdrive Hour.
[03:29:47.296 --> 03:29:47.997]  Thanks for watching.
[03:29:57.324 --> 03:30:00.345]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:30:00.365 --> 03:30:04.046]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:08.207 --> 03:30:13.748]  Indiana Sheriff Brad Rogers made his stance on the Second Amendment clear during a recent interview.
[03:30:14.088 --> 03:30:24.311]  If President Obama today said, I'm creating an executive order that all sheriffs and police chiefs around this nation need to start registering firearms, I will disregard it.
[03:30:24.551 --> 03:30:34.295]  Presidential candidate Jim Webb defended the Second Amendment rights of Americans during the first Democratic debate and he actually called out his fellow politicians on their hypocrisy.
[03:30:34.455 --> 03:30:42.077]  There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[03:30:42.437 --> 03:30:47.479]  The average American does not have that and deserves the right to be able to protect their family.
[03:30:47.739 --> 03:30:52.021]  And Webb's point echoes recent comments made by media pioneer Matt Drudge.
[03:30:52.461 --> 03:30:53.622]  I challenge Hillary.
[03:30:53.882 --> 03:30:55.403]  Take away your secret service.
[03:30:55.683 --> 03:30:56.503]  Dismiss them.
[03:30:56.964 --> 03:30:57.504]  I dare you.
[03:30:57.824 --> 03:30:58.765]  Obama, same thing.
[03:30:59.005 --> 03:31:00.766]  Leave the White House unguarded, Obama.
[03:31:00.786 --> 03:31:02.447]  You know what would happen in 30 seconds?
[03:31:02.987 --> 03:31:04.988]  Both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth.
[03:31:05.269 --> 03:31:07.590]  Read more now at InfoWars.com

[03:32:08.470 --> 03:32:08.911]  Good, brother.
[03:32:09.051 --> 03:32:10.713]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:32:10.773 --> 03:32:12.555]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:32:12.715 --> 03:32:16.740]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:32:16.760 --> 03:32:19.323]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[03:32:19.363 --> 03:32:21.585]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:32:21.785 --> 03:32:23.848]  Super Mill Vitality was developed.
[03:32:24.088 --> 03:32:29.691]  To activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[03:32:43.199 --> 03:32:57.429]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[03:32:57.489 --> 03:32:59.191]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[03:33:10.726 --> 03:33:16.756]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:33:17.357 --> 03:33:20.341]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:27.481 --> 03:33:36.533]  The toll-free number to call in 800-259-9231 and you can ask your question to Merc Whistleblower Brandy Vaughn who's here in studio.
[03:33:37.214 --> 03:33:42.341]  After we do the interview here she's gonna go do an interview with Leanne McAdoo and cover a slide presentation.
[03:33:42.541 --> 03:33:49.482]  She's put together and that'll be on the InfoWars Nightly News tomorrow night along with some of the callers that we're going to be getting.
[03:33:49.522 --> 03:33:51.283]  We have Shane calling from North Carolina.
[03:33:51.323 --> 03:33:54.063]  Anybody else want to call in with your vaccine question 800-259-9231.
[03:33:54.143 --> 03:34:00.445]  Now before we get to these callers, right now we have Secret 12.
[03:34:00.965 --> 03:34:04.766]  It's vitamin B12 supplement that we have at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:34:04.826 --> 03:34:05.166]  It is 20% off.
[03:34:07.046 --> 03:34:12.551]  And also, you can start re-upping your supply of super male vitality.
[03:34:13.091 --> 03:34:18.236]  These are the two actual vials that I take with me when I go play basketball.
[03:34:18.256 --> 03:34:23.160]  I'm playing basketball tonight, and before I step on the court, I do two dropper fulls of each.
[03:34:23.761 --> 03:34:25.362]  And it helps get me through the game.
[03:34:25.462 --> 03:34:32.248]  I'm already over 40, so I need to keep up with the 25-year-olds that I play against once a week.
[03:34:33.709 --> 03:34:37.120]  Especially because I'm a taller guy, I have to get under the basket and rebound.
[03:34:37.581 --> 03:34:40.611]  So this helps me doing all that stuff, super male vitality.
[03:34:41.561 --> 03:34:45.042]  It's been sold out for over a month, but now we're going to have a huge supply coming in.
[03:34:45.342 --> 03:34:46.522]  But get your order in now.
[03:34:46.542 --> 03:34:52.524]  It's one of our most popular products at Inflowerslife.com, along with the Secret 12 Vitamin B12.
[03:34:53.364 --> 03:34:56.085]  And this is the Vitamin B12 they have in here.
[03:34:56.105 --> 03:34:58.786]  I think it's the same type they actually inject into you.
[03:34:58.846 --> 03:35:01.767]  So this is a really good source of Vitamin B12.
[03:35:01.887 --> 03:35:05.708]  It gives you that extra energy, and the Supermail will keep you going long into the night.
[03:35:06.488 --> 03:35:08.813]  Now, Brandy, we've got some callers coming in.
[03:35:09.654 --> 03:35:16.647]  But first, let's get to a couple of... You're really on the fight right now with this mandatory HPV vaccine.
[03:35:16.707 --> 03:35:18.912]  Tell us what's coming down the pipe with that.
[03:35:19.946 --> 03:35:30.274]  Yeah, actually, the HPV vaccine, Gardasil, which is made by Merck, it's pretty much the driving force behind the mandatory vaccine laws that we're seeing.
[03:35:30.974 --> 03:35:35.278]  Merck, we call it in the industry, have to pay for Vioxx vaccine.
[03:35:36.018 --> 03:35:42.123]  And, you know, Vioxx, largest drug recall in the world, happened before and now Merck has to make it.
[03:35:42.743 --> 03:35:44.264]  It has to recoup some of those profits.
[03:35:44.864 --> 03:35:51.026]  And they priced it at $135 a dose, got the FDA to approve three doses within six months.
[03:35:51.106 --> 03:35:55.747]  It has huge, high aluminum content, like we were mentioning with the vitamin K shot.
[03:35:56.527 --> 03:35:59.628]  And they got it approved for boys and girls, 9 to 26.
[03:36:00.668 --> 03:36:03.189]  So they're looking at tens of billions of dollars with this.
[03:36:03.309 --> 03:36:04.429]  It's their new blockbuster.
[03:36:05.790 --> 03:36:09.351]  And that is really what's driving a lot of these mandatory vaccine laws.
[03:36:09.591 --> 03:36:10.931]  And I don't know if you've seen the videos.
[03:36:10.951 --> 03:36:15.092]  There's videos, uh, one that was out of, uh, I think it was Colombia or Venezuela.
[03:36:15.372 --> 03:36:18.753]  And it was the room full of girls all convulsing at the same time.
[03:36:18.813 --> 03:36:20.093]  And they'd just been given the shot.
[03:36:20.493 --> 03:36:22.234]  The guy's on video going, we don't know what's going on.
[03:36:22.254 --> 03:36:23.074]  They told us to do this.
[03:36:23.174 --> 03:36:24.114]  We think there's something up.
[03:36:24.154 --> 03:36:24.754]  Please help us.
[03:36:24.794 --> 03:36:25.394]  Please help us.
[03:36:26.154 --> 03:36:29.635]  These people are utterly just being devastated around the world.
[03:36:29.695 --> 03:36:30.915]  It's not just in the United States.
[03:36:30.955 --> 03:36:33.996]  This is worldwide that this stuff is, is a bioweapon, it seems like.
[03:36:34.136 --> 03:36:34.316]  Right.
[03:36:34.576 --> 03:36:37.499]  Japan has taken it off of their recommended schedule.
[03:36:37.519 --> 03:36:51.051]  The EU just in September launched an investigation into the HPV vaccine after a great Danish documentary came out exposing how many serious reactions are being seen in
[03:36:51.591 --> 03:36:53.492]  Populations of girls being given this vaccine.
[03:36:53.912 --> 03:37:00.876]  And there are lawsuits all around the country against Merck, against the vaccine maker for injuries and deaths related to Gardasil.
[03:37:01.237 --> 03:37:02.998]  And that's one important point here in the U.S.
[03:37:03.898 --> 03:37:09.741]  Vaccines are, you know, completely protected but have complete liability protection from the federal government.
[03:37:10.162 --> 03:37:18.366]  So those lawsuits that we're seeing around the world and the information that comes out in the discovery process of the judicial process, we can't do that here in the U.S.
[03:37:18.506 --> 03:37:19.027]  It's all hidden.
[03:37:19.847 --> 03:37:27.552]  And there's no liability, which means that vaccine makers make far more profit off of vaccines than they do normal pharmaceutical drugs.
[03:37:27.712 --> 03:37:30.233]  And they don't pay for any of these payouts.
[03:37:30.354 --> 03:37:34.276]  It all comes from the dose that you pay for when you get the vaccine.
[03:37:34.296 --> 03:37:39.819]  $2 of that goes into this fund, which is a huge slush fund, but they've paid out over $3 billion already.
[03:37:40.120 --> 03:37:42.161]  So it's not safe and effective like they keep telling us.
[03:37:42.441 --> 03:37:44.382]  Let's go to Shane in North Carolina.
[03:37:44.422 --> 03:37:45.823]  Shane, what is on your mind?
[03:37:47.764 --> 03:37:48.545]  Yeah, I just want to...
[03:37:49.600 --> 03:37:50.901]  Share my story actually.
[03:37:51.541 --> 03:37:56.704]  You were talking about the vitamin K shot and that's one of them that you seldom hear people talk about.
[03:37:57.364 --> 03:37:58.765]  My wife and I just had our second.
[03:37:59.833 --> 03:38:06.416]  Yeah, we had our second baby boy about a month ago, and he arrived a week early.
[03:38:06.496 --> 03:38:10.758]  My wife and I were already looking into taking the vitamin K orally.
[03:38:11.218 --> 03:38:28.986]  We knew that we were going to refuse the Hep B, but we thought we had a week to, you know, figure out which vitamin K we were going to buy and all that, and all of a sudden, you know, she went into labor, and all of a sudden we were in the hospital and having this baby a week earlier than planned.
[03:38:29.586 --> 03:38:35.553]  So then, you know, these people are coming around me with their clipboards and everything talking about, you know, like they do.
[03:38:36.094 --> 03:38:39.658]  And I said, yeah, well, we're not doing the Happy and then they're like, well, what about the vitamin K?
[03:38:39.718 --> 03:38:42.462]  I'm like, well, we were going to do that orally.
[03:38:44.284 --> 03:38:49.469]  But, you know, we thought the baby was coming a week later, so we didn't really make a decision.
[03:38:49.990 --> 03:38:51.651]  So I guess we'll just hold off on that one, too.
[03:38:52.372 --> 03:38:57.517]  And then, I mean, they're like whispering and acting like it's the biggest deal in the world.
[03:38:57.978 --> 03:39:06.947]  They were making a bigger deal about me not getting the vitamin K than they were about the hep B. They had my pediatrician call me.
[03:39:08.513 --> 03:39:18.403]  I mean, my pediatrician called, he was somehow affiliated with their hospital apparently, but he called and said, you know, we just kind of want to know, why don't you want to get this vitamin K?
[03:39:18.844 --> 03:39:20.385]  And like, everyone was asking me.
[03:39:20.445 --> 03:39:24.830]  And they tried to scare you with, you know, the bleeding that could happen and everything else.
[03:39:24.890 --> 03:39:27.232]  Yeah, they really put that scare tactic on you.
[03:39:27.272 --> 03:39:28.414]  I've gone through it with four kids.
[03:39:28.954 --> 03:39:32.357]  First of all, I wasn't prepared to deal with this reaction from them.
[03:39:32.417 --> 03:39:32.877]  It freaked me out.
[03:39:56.563 --> 03:40:01.868]  I, you know, my wife is not quite, quite where I'm at with all this stuff.
[03:40:01.988 --> 03:40:02.309]  Okay.
[03:40:02.869 --> 03:40:10.757]  Uh, the vaccines and, you know, we, um, our, our first son has only had the DTAP against my will, but my wife felt very strongly about it.
[03:40:11.698 --> 03:40:17.243]  Um, so, um, she said, well, let's just get it.
[03:40:17.924 --> 03:40:23.228]  You know, we have, you know, she got kind of scared into, you know, let's just, you know, get the K vaccine.
[03:40:23.569 --> 03:40:25.650]  And I was just like, I don't know, you know, let's just wait.
[03:40:25.730 --> 03:40:35.738]  I mean, we, I mean, we can just get them some drops and I'll get, I'll get them, you know, sent within the next day or two, but they freaked out about it.
[03:40:36.199 --> 03:40:41.223]  So then my pediatrician called and I said, yeah, we don't, I don't feel comfortable injecting this into my baby.
[03:40:41.243 --> 03:40:45.406]  And he said, well, uh, you can, you know, technically take it orally.
[03:40:47.176 --> 03:41:04.070]  So I ended up deciding to do that, and I mean, I kind of regret it hearing everything that you talked about, you know, being in it, but I suppose it's better to take it orally than to have that injected, mainlined into a newborn, but that's what we ended up doing at the hospital is
[03:41:05.518 --> 03:41:11.879]  He took a certain amount of it, orally, an amount that was recommended by the pediatrician.
[03:41:12.259 --> 03:41:13.140]  Right.
[03:41:13.440 --> 03:41:15.200]  And it was actually right from the vaccine.
[03:41:15.360 --> 03:41:17.741]  Yeah, they just take it out and, right, they do that.
[03:41:18.081 --> 03:41:20.801]  Because they don't really have anything on hand, and that's what they try to say.
[03:41:20.841 --> 03:41:23.442]  Well, we don't have that on hand, we just have to give them the regular one.
[03:41:23.482 --> 03:41:32.744]  And then with my case, they wanted to give them more down the line, and we ended up going to a compounding pharmacy, which are kind of rare, I found out, but they were able to make a really
[03:41:33.604 --> 03:41:37.567]  You know, pure version of vitamin K for us without any preservatives or anything.
[03:41:37.587 --> 03:41:40.550]  Really, really nice people at People's Pharmacy.
[03:41:43.712 --> 03:41:49.377]  I had my son in Holland and granted it was a home birth, but there was no talk about the vitamin K shot.
[03:41:49.837 --> 03:41:56.700]  So, this standard protocol that's going on here in the U.S., outside in other countries, this is not the same.
[03:41:56.900 --> 03:41:58.321]  It's not the same standard protocol.
[03:41:58.741 --> 03:42:01.963]  I never heard about vitamin K. They didn't even talk to me about vaccines.
[03:42:02.403 --> 03:42:06.485]  They said at his two-month appointment with the midwives, do you want to talk about vaccines?
[03:42:06.545 --> 03:42:07.626]  Some parents do.
[03:42:07.726 --> 03:42:10.447]  I said, why would I want, you know, to do that?
[03:42:10.527 --> 03:42:11.507]  He's perfectly healthy.
[03:42:12.248 --> 03:42:14.609]  And she's like, great, because we don't want to talk about them either.
[03:42:15.309 --> 03:42:15.789]  Exactly.
[03:42:15.949 --> 03:42:20.251]  So I think we have this idea that everywhere in the world does it just like the U.S.
[03:42:20.691 --> 03:42:22.231]  and here in the U.S.
[03:42:22.251 --> 03:42:34.515]  we do it far differently and these things that they try to push on us as standard protocol in the hospital and when we're giving birth and with our children with the whole vaccine program, this is not how it's done in the rest of the world.
[03:42:34.835 --> 03:42:35.316]  Right.
[03:42:35.336 --> 03:42:39.460]  We lead the world with our vaccine schedule, and we lead the world with infant mortality.
[03:42:40.401 --> 03:42:41.322]  In developing countries.
[03:42:41.522 --> 03:42:42.843]  In developing countries, to be fair.
[03:42:43.864 --> 03:42:44.605]  In developed countries.
[03:42:44.785 --> 03:42:45.386]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:42:45.646 --> 03:42:47.608]  I still think we are developing in some ways.
[03:42:48.029 --> 03:42:49.991]  Mike in Tennessee, what is your question?
[03:42:50.011 --> 03:42:54.655]  I just wanted to find out, did you work at the facility in Marietta, Georgia?
[03:42:55.367 --> 03:43:04.597]  No, I was a sales rep, and I repped Vioxx, and that experience showed me that things that are on the market are not necessarily safe, and there's a lot of corruption behind the scenes.
[03:43:05.759 --> 03:43:13.828]  Well, if you ever have an opportunity, I know someone personally that works there, worked there for many, many years, and just walking through there and just looking at
[03:43:14.779 --> 03:43:22.883]  The procedures, the way that this is done, the way these things are manufactured, you would want to think twice about putting any of that stuff in your body.
[03:43:23.303 --> 03:43:31.767]  And of course, as you touched on, have your kids at home, keep them there, keep your money in your pocket, don't submit to these authoritarians.
[03:43:32.248 --> 03:43:36.770]  I mean, they're out of their mind sociopaths and anybody that would listen to them is just insane.
[03:43:37.490 --> 03:43:38.051]  Totally agree.
[03:43:38.071 --> 03:43:40.914]  I mean, bovine serum, people even know what that is.
[03:43:41.294 --> 03:43:44.117]  Diploid cells, those are made out of aborted fetal cells.
[03:43:44.157 --> 03:43:45.138]  Dog kidney cells?
[03:43:45.319 --> 03:43:53.467]  Yeah, that's the stuff that monkey kidney cells and the polio vaccine, you know, that's the stuff they inject people with and you don't know what that's doing on a DNA level.
[03:43:53.567 --> 03:43:54.848]  Yeah, it's damaging our DNA.
[03:43:55.048 --> 03:43:56.989]  And they're not doing those tests, I guarantee you.
[03:43:57.029 --> 03:43:57.870]  They're not doing those tests.
[03:43:57.890 --> 03:43:59.130]  They're going, are you getting sick?
[03:43:59.150 --> 03:43:59.631]  Are you dying?
[03:43:59.651 --> 03:44:00.311]  Okay, it's safe.
[03:44:00.351 --> 03:44:01.172]  Safe and effective.
[03:44:01.192 --> 03:44:01.552]  Let's get it out.
[03:44:01.572 --> 03:44:02.413]  Let's get it out the door.
[03:44:02.433 --> 03:44:04.234]  Right, because there's no long-term safety studies.
[03:44:05.094 --> 03:44:07.135]  And the FDA often fast-tracks them.
[03:44:07.175 --> 03:44:12.299]  And a lot of people don't realize the safety studies that are done on vaccines, they're not done with the proper placebos.
[03:44:12.739 --> 03:44:15.240]  It's very substandard safety testing.
[03:44:15.701 --> 03:44:20.424]  No long-term, no combination doses, even though we give kids six to nine doses, sometimes more.
[03:44:21.004 --> 03:44:21.865]  I mean that's ridiculous!
[03:44:41.767 --> 03:44:44.688]  It's a totally untapped market for pharmaceutical companies.
[03:44:45.048 --> 03:44:53.691]  They're looking at a pharmaceutical drug market that's completely saturated, a bunch of competition, high hurdles of safety testing to get into the market, and then vaccines.
[03:44:53.851 --> 03:44:56.672]  I mean, look at all these disease states that they could come up with vaccines for.
[03:44:56.952 --> 03:45:00.533]  They're coming up with an anthrax vaccine, cancer, HIV.
[03:45:00.713 --> 03:45:02.134]  An anti-government vaccine.
[03:45:02.954 --> 03:45:03.375]  Exactly.
[03:45:03.515 --> 03:45:07.179]  I would never want these things put into my body, dead or alive.
[03:45:07.400 --> 03:45:08.401]  They don't belong in my body.
[03:45:09.001 --> 03:45:11.524]  And they're coming.
[03:45:11.885 --> 03:45:13.186]  And that's what people don't understand.
[03:45:13.306 --> 03:45:14.528]  And it starts in California.
[03:45:15.549 --> 03:45:17.491]  SB 277 is their opening salvo.
[03:45:17.872 --> 03:45:22.197]  And when it sticks there and people don't fight back, it's going to continue to move.
[03:45:22.737 --> 03:45:23.638]  It's going to go west.
[03:45:23.918 --> 03:45:28.863]  It'll probably go from California all the way to Massachusetts and Rhode Island and those New England states.
[03:45:29.103 --> 03:45:31.145]  And then it's going to make its way into the heartland.
[03:45:31.505 --> 03:45:34.788]  I think Texas might hold out a little bit, but we'll see.
[03:45:34.928 --> 03:45:35.889]  Yeah, we'll see.
[03:45:35.929 --> 03:45:37.170]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[03:45:37.430 --> 03:45:39.192]  John, what is your question?
[03:45:40.953 --> 03:45:44.096]  Yes, Brandy, thank you for what you're doing.
[03:45:45.601 --> 03:45:52.629]  Wonderful to see someone that is exposing what's going on in this Merck industry.
[03:45:52.649 --> 03:45:54.671]  You said you were involved with Vioxx?
[03:45:55.212 --> 03:45:57.134]  Yes.
[03:45:57.414 --> 03:45:58.876]  They lost a lawsuit, didn't they?
[03:46:01.238 --> 03:46:10.861]  My sister, who is a vaccine researcher in South Carolina, Mary Tocco, and she does have a website, childhoodshots.com, but she's been doing this for over 35 years.
[03:46:11.001 --> 03:46:20.004]  She ran into an attorney there in South Carolina that represented the defendants, and he told her that they came out with the Gardasil to pick up the
[03:46:21.100 --> 03:46:26.865]  Extra money that they lost on the lawsuit and that's why it's being promoted from one standpoint.
[03:46:26.905 --> 03:46:31.829]  But if you could ever get a hold of my sister, she would probably be very happy to hear your information.
[03:46:31.910 --> 03:46:34.672]  She's at ChildhoodShots.com and her name is Mary Tocco.
[03:46:35.419 --> 03:46:36.500]  I've heard her name out there.
[03:46:37.081 --> 03:46:40.324]  I can't remember anything recently that I've seen from her, but yeah, I've seen her out there.
[03:46:40.344 --> 03:46:41.285]  There's a lot of good people.
[03:46:41.526 --> 03:46:43.748]  Dr. Humphreys, Susan Humphreys is out there fighting it.
[03:46:44.449 --> 03:46:45.129]  Sherry Tenpenny.
[03:46:45.169 --> 03:46:51.996]  There's a lot of people really fighting this issue, and it's great to see people coming together, more people like yourself speaking out against this.
[03:46:52.036 --> 03:46:55.080]  So it's really giving hope, I think, to parents because
[03:46:55.780 --> 03:47:24.411]  One thing the pediatrician said was it must be really scary being a parent now because there's so much information and the whole time she was saying that I was thinking she really means it's so hard and scary being a pediatrician because there's so much information that parents are arming themselves with and they're standing up and saying no to that regimented schedule of just injecting aluminum into your body and if you know go listen to Dr. Blalock give a two-hour speech on what aluminum does when it goes into your brain and all they do when they do these studies and correct me if I'm wrong they just test for antibodies
[03:47:24.491 --> 03:47:25.752]  They just go, oh, you got antibodies.
[03:47:25.772 --> 03:47:26.452]  That means it works.
[03:47:27.173 --> 03:47:32.916]  And what's going on is these adjuvants like aluminum and mercury are stimulating the brain and creating antibodies.
[03:47:32.956 --> 03:47:34.877]  And they go, oh, well, there's your proof that it works.
[03:47:34.897 --> 03:47:36.278]  There's your proof that it's safe and effective.
[03:47:36.298 --> 03:47:36.698]  Is that right?
[03:47:36.758 --> 03:47:37.379]  Is that how they do that?
[03:47:37.904 --> 03:47:45.649]  Yes, and one thing that I think people aren't aware of is that in a natural environment, we would never come into contact with six to nine pathogens at one time.
[03:47:45.929 --> 03:48:02.000]  So when we're injecting this with the adjuvants, which are heavy metals, which are very toxic and hard to detox from, as well as additives like formaldehyde and the monkey and the animal and human cells, DNA, polysorbate 80, MSG, which we're supposed to avoid in Chinese food, right?
[03:48:02.620 --> 03:48:08.984]  And mercury, which we're supposed to avoid in fish, but it's okay to inject into the bloodstream where it goes straight to the vital organs.
[03:48:10.525 --> 03:48:18.110]  What we're seeing when you inject so many vaccine doses and so many pathogens with all of these adjuvants, the body has no idea what's going on.
[03:48:18.391 --> 03:48:20.352]  We're overwhelming the immune system.
[03:48:20.632 --> 03:48:30.839]  And so this is where we're seeing all of these autoimmune issues, the food allergies, asthma, eczema, psoriasis, lupus, all of these types of things, because the body just starts fighting everything.
[03:48:30.879 --> 03:48:32.240]  It starts attacking itself.
[03:48:32.300 --> 03:48:33.201]  It attacks itself.
[03:48:33.602 --> 03:48:38.046]  And it attacks things like peanut oil, peanut allergies, or because peanut oil is used as a stabilizer.
[03:48:38.066 --> 03:48:38.546]  It's off the charts.
[03:48:38.566 --> 03:48:43.531]  There's like five kids in my neighborhood who can't have peanut butter, and if my kids eat peanut butter sandwiches, they have to go outside.
[03:48:43.551 --> 03:48:44.632]  It's ridiculous.
[03:48:44.672 --> 03:48:48.656]  Yes, and these are things, and people are accepting this as the new normal in the U.S.
[03:48:48.976 --> 03:48:52.259]  When I had peanut butter and jelly sandwiches all the time when I was a child.
[03:48:52.299 --> 03:48:53.080]  We all grew up on that.
[03:48:53.100 --> 03:48:54.702]  Wait a minute, I think we're being racist now.
[03:48:54.742 --> 03:48:59.369]  That's actually a racist term to say peanut butter and jelly sandwich, so we gotta cut that line of conversation.
[03:48:59.890 --> 03:49:03.535]  Go to our next caller, MJ in Georgia wants to talk about the vitamin K shot.
[03:49:03.995 --> 03:49:04.676]  What's on your mind, MJ?
[03:49:06.728 --> 03:49:07.889]  Just a few quick things.
[03:49:08.669 --> 03:49:27.096]  I've looked at quite a bit of your work, Brandy, online and done some research myself, but I'm actually assumed to be father, and I was researching vitamin K myself, and benzene, the benzene alcohol that's in there is actually a chemical that they put in ethanol so you can't drink it as moonshine.
[03:49:27.116 --> 03:49:29.677]  And if you drink it, it of course makes you sick.
[03:49:30.698 --> 03:49:31.198]  Secondly,
[03:49:31.838 --> 03:49:38.725]  I called the round doctors to, one, try to see if any type of drops were available, but they make it unavailable to you.
[03:49:39.066 --> 03:49:46.493]  But if you read the insert on the vaccine, the vaccine says that if this intravenous shot can be avoided, it should be avoided.
[03:49:46.894 --> 03:49:47.474]  You know what I mean?
[03:49:47.514 --> 03:49:48.816]  Because of the toxic levels.
[03:49:49.116 --> 03:49:50.838]  I didn't know they had aluminum in it.
[03:49:53.140 --> 03:49:58.662]  I really want to avoid it, but my wife is on the fence, and they scare them.
[03:49:58.702 --> 03:50:09.268]  They tell them that, specifically dealing with natural births and midwives, they tell you it's a risk involved with the baby coming through the birth canal, and there's pressure on his head, and he could have internal bleeding.
[03:50:09.688 --> 03:50:09.948]  I think so.
[03:50:27.359 --> 03:50:28.080]  Well, let me just say this.
[03:50:28.340 --> 03:50:33.124]  Brandi's not a doctor and she can't provide medical advice, but we can sit here and bitch about these all day long.
[03:50:33.144 --> 03:50:34.104]  Do your own research.
[03:50:46.954 --> 03:50:48.955]  I would say check out Dr. Sherry Tinpenny online.
[03:50:48.995 --> 03:50:51.917]  She's got some videos specifically about the vitamin K shot.
[03:50:52.297 --> 03:50:57.400]  And I can tell you, from my own experience, my wife doubled and tripled up on kale.
[03:50:57.460 --> 03:50:59.661]  Kale has high amounts of vitamin K in it.
[03:51:00.081 --> 03:51:01.302]  And that's what we did.
[03:51:01.622 --> 03:51:02.863]  So take that for what it's worth.
[03:51:02.883 --> 03:51:06.445]  We're going to be back with one more segment with Brandy Vaughn, whistleblower from Merck.
[03:51:06.485 --> 03:51:06.905]  Stay tuned.
[03:51:06.925 --> 03:51:08.406]  It's the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:51:08.846 --> 03:51:16.871]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:17.551 --> 03:51:18.292]  What did I do?
[03:51:19.032 --> 03:51:26.356]  I created ExtendoVite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.
[03:51:26.977 --> 03:51:35.242]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you, so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did.
[03:51:35.942 --> 03:51:40.364]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your natural immune system.
[03:51:41.104 --> 03:51:44.466]  I'm 60 years old now and I still work every day.
[03:51:44.766 --> 03:51:46.447]  To get your Xtendivite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:46.467 --> 03:51:47.627]  That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:51:47.647 --> 03:51:50.669]  Xtendivite is only $69.95 for a 2-month supply of either capsules or liquid.
[03:52:07.818 --> 03:52:11.920]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[03:52:12.081 --> 03:52:16.283]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[03:52:16.324 --> 03:52:19.386]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2,
[03:52:20.006 --> 03:52:23.527]  It's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[03:52:23.667 --> 03:52:34.192]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[03:52:34.352 --> 03:52:37.673]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[03:52:37.813 --> 03:52:38.834]  What do you have to lose?
[03:52:38.934 --> 03:52:47.260]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[03:52:47.380 --> 03:52:50.583]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[03:52:50.683 --> 03:52:54.726]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[03:52:54.826 --> 03:52:56.967]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[03:52:57.147 --> 03:53:04.113]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:53:08.962 --> 03:53:16.705]  Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day and the home security industry wants you to believe that's your only option.
[03:53:16.985 --> 03:53:22.146]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[03:53:22.446 --> 03:53:27.068]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[03:53:27.348 --> 03:53:30.569]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.
[03:53:30.869 --> 03:53:32.950]  But there's a better way to protect your home.
[03:53:33.290 --> 03:53:34.850]  SimpliSafe Home Security.

[03:54:17.785 --> 03:54:19.806]  Final segment of the Overdrive Hour.
[03:54:19.826 --> 03:54:20.847]  This is Rob Due, your host.
[03:54:21.047 --> 03:54:26.651]  I'm joined in studio with Brandy Vaughn, Merc Whistleblower, and we've been having a very lively conversation about vaccines.
[03:54:26.711 --> 03:54:33.996]  I really get amped up about vaccines, and I didn't know I was doing the show until I got here today, and when I found out it was going to be talking to Brandy, who I've watched her videos.
[03:54:34.376 --> 03:54:38.559]  She's been attacked for coming and speaking out, especially with SB 277.
[03:54:38.859 --> 03:54:41.521]  We may have time to get into that, or you'll cover it with Leanne.
[03:54:41.581 --> 03:54:42.962]  We do have some more callers.
[03:54:44.003 --> 03:54:47.065]  So let's go to Brenda, who's a medical assistant, wants to talk about vaccines.
[03:54:47.705 --> 03:54:50.487]  Hi, how are you doing?
[03:54:50.547 --> 03:54:51.007]  Doing great.
[03:54:51.027 --> 03:54:51.948]  What's on your mind?
[03:54:52.769 --> 03:55:01.054]  Well, like 20 years ago I was a medical assistant for a holistic MD, MRCP in the Lake Geneva area.
[03:55:01.655 --> 03:55:02.395]  I learned a lot.
[03:55:02.415 --> 03:55:11.102]  We used homeopathics and then I went back to school, got my certification for medical assistant and worked in mainstream medicine.
[03:55:14.266 --> 03:55:20.471]  You know, it's ridiculous how many vaccines they give to babies, you know, at a time.
[03:55:21.411 --> 03:55:30.138]  And some, you know, sometimes they don't even give, we're required to give out a vaccination information sheet.
[03:55:31.337 --> 03:55:32.858]  Right, which is not the insert.
[03:55:33.158 --> 03:55:41.083]  It's an eight and a half by eleven piece of paper and it just says they're safe and effective and don't worry and if you notice anything let us know and maybe we'll deal with it.
[03:55:41.283 --> 03:55:41.803]  Right?
[03:55:41.923 --> 03:55:43.584]  And we'll tell you it's a coincidence.
[03:55:43.604 --> 03:55:45.325]  We'll tell you it's a coincidence and that's normal.
[03:55:46.006 --> 03:55:57.392]  We had a guy in here, Marcos, who's talking about, he actually went on the air and talked about how his, I think his oldest girl got vaccinated and was crying constantly for 12 hours and I said, oh that's normal.
[03:55:57.873 --> 03:55:58.373]  That's normal.
[03:55:58.433 --> 03:55:59.974]  No, that's because of the brain swelling.
[03:56:00.134 --> 03:56:00.774]  That is an attack.
[03:56:00.834 --> 03:56:01.595]  And the febrile seizures.
[03:56:01.755 --> 03:56:02.995]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:56:03.195 --> 03:56:04.836]  Thanks for calling in, Brenda.
[03:56:04.936 --> 03:56:07.197]  We had somebody call in and said vaccines, any good ones.
[03:56:07.217 --> 03:56:11.459]  He's hung up now, but you were saying, what were you saying about vaccines?
[03:56:11.479 --> 03:56:12.720]  Are there any good ones or bad ones?
[03:56:12.760 --> 03:56:13.540]  What can we trust?
[03:56:14.554 --> 03:56:18.357]  I think every parent should do the research because the children deserve it.
[03:56:19.298 --> 03:56:25.864]  My son is vax-free and I don't feel that the benefits outweigh the risks by far.
[03:56:26.184 --> 03:56:26.644]  Exactly.
[03:56:27.005 --> 03:56:34.351]  My two youngest are completely vax-free and my two oldest have very, very small amounts that I was against the whole time.
[03:56:34.651 --> 03:56:36.933]  But I had to fight the medical establishment and my wife.
[03:56:37.173 --> 03:56:37.854]  But it can be done.
[03:56:37.874 --> 03:56:39.255]  We had a caller who was talking about his wife.
[03:56:39.575 --> 03:56:40.716]  You just got to do the research.
[03:56:40.976 --> 03:56:41.757]  Get the inserts.
[03:56:41.777 --> 03:56:43.138]  You can look them up online.
[03:56:43.198 --> 03:56:45.199]  All you got to do is type in the vaccine and the insert.
[03:56:45.440 --> 03:56:52.285]  There's a whole page of them on websites out there and you can read the actual insert that comes from the company and you can read about all the things they cause.
[03:56:52.605 --> 03:56:58.230]  Bill, Indiana, you think charcoal is effective against the shots or are you calling to ask if charcoal is effective?
[03:56:58.670 --> 03:57:01.231]  Rob, is charcoal effective?
[03:57:01.331 --> 03:57:08.033]  If you're in a corner and you have to take the shots, would charcoal be an effective way to filter some of that poison out of your system?
[03:57:08.733 --> 03:57:10.453]  It's probably better than nothing, but I don't know.
[03:57:10.533 --> 03:57:13.334]  I mean, they're injecting it into your body and not into your stomach.
[03:57:13.454 --> 03:57:24.697]  That's the thing with charcoal is that you're ingesting it and what happens with vaccines is they go straight into your bloodstream and straight to your vital organs without going through the detox process, through the kidney, through the lungs or the skin.
[03:57:28.122 --> 03:57:29.183]  It's probably better than nothing.
[03:57:29.483 --> 03:57:30.464]  It is a detox.
[03:57:32.425 --> 03:57:35.608]  But how much help it is, I guess it depends on the person.
[03:57:35.628 --> 03:57:38.510]  And you can find videos out there.
[03:57:38.530 --> 03:57:39.911]  I think Dr. Blalock has one too.
[03:57:39.951 --> 03:57:41.732]  If you have to take the shot, this is what to do.
[03:57:41.752 --> 03:57:42.853]  He mentioned some stuff.
[03:57:42.993 --> 03:57:44.014]  He's got some great information.
[03:57:44.034 --> 03:57:47.717]  There's a lot of great information out there, which is really awesome to see.
[03:57:47.877 --> 03:57:49.819]  Alex, in Virginia, what is your question?
[03:57:51.477 --> 03:57:54.020]  Hey Rob, I just wanted to make a couple comments.
[03:57:54.100 --> 03:58:07.773]  My father-in-law is a construction worker and he was working at the Merck facility here in Virginia and he would tell me stories about how it's like it was so toxic they have to wear these masks and stuff to be able to even go in there and work.
[03:58:07.834 --> 03:58:08.855]  It's like so bad.
[03:58:09.615 --> 03:58:14.718]  I was able to convince my sister-in-law not to get the HPV vaccine because of it.
[03:58:14.738 --> 03:58:17.460]  Because I was like, come on, you know, your dad's there inhaling these fumes.
[03:58:17.500 --> 03:58:20.241]  They're putting it into a vaccine and you're getting it injected.
[03:58:21.662 --> 03:58:26.945]  Yeah, if you gotta wear a spacesuit to go to the building, I mean, what do you think they're putting in these things?
[03:58:27.206 --> 03:58:29.307]  And it's, you know, I don't think it's for your health.
[03:58:29.607 --> 03:58:29.847]  Yeah.
[03:58:30.267 --> 03:58:30.868]  I don't think so.
[03:58:31.428 --> 03:58:35.932]  Randy, you're gonna be getting together with Leigh Ann McAdoo, talking more.
[03:58:35.972 --> 03:58:42.717]  We'll probably do an extended interview, maybe play part of it then, and then more out later, because you got so much information, and we're just out of time!
[03:58:43.178 --> 03:58:43.718]  So join us!
[03:58:43.898 --> 03:58:44.619]  Thanks for having me.
[03:58:44.679 --> 03:58:46.160]  Tomorrow, tonight, 7 p.m.
[03:58:46.180 --> 03:58:47.481]  Central, in 4 Wars Nightly News.
[03:58:50.644 --> 03:58:54.607]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:57.819 --> 03:59:01.021]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:59:01.321 --> 03:59:09.346]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:59:09.566 --> 03:59:14.590]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:59:14.990 --> 03:59:17.271]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
