[00:00:11.394 --> 00:00:23.021]  During the Christmas holiday back in 1913, Congress enacted a communistic centralization of your money, transferred to the control of an elite few.
[00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:24.882]  Communistic, you say?
[00:00:25.142 --> 00:00:33.187]  Well, the second plank of the Communist Manifesto states a heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
[00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.108]  The fifth plank states
[00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:43.891]  Centralization of credit in the hands of the state by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly.
[00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:52.574]  Those planks have been long established in the United States, so it stands to reason that we are living in a somewhat communist country.
[00:00:52.975 --> 00:00:56.296]  Of course, all of the planks, if researched.
[00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:59.057]  Apply to the current state of government in the U.S.
[00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:01.259]  in one way, shape, or form.
[00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.440]  For instance, Plank No.
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.440]  6.
[00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:09.383]  Centralization of the means of communication and transportation in the hands of the state.
[00:01:09.624 --> 00:01:17.028]  Of course, the FCC is all over the control of communications, not to mention the NSA and your friendly neighborhood fusion center.
[00:01:17.208 --> 00:01:30.192]  And a lot of socialist-controlled examples, such as the Postal Service and the government's control of Amtrak and Conrail, represents the government's hand being placed in the free enterprise cookie jar for the world to see.
[00:01:30.492 --> 00:01:34.933]  But that's only the beginning of where government-controlled transportation is heading.
[00:01:35.213 --> 00:01:36.694]  The Huffington Post reports.
[00:01:37.074 --> 00:01:51.711]  There's growing confusion about how would-be flyers from Louisiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and New York will board planes when provisions of the REAL ID Act go into effect, because their state ID and driver's license processes
[00:01:52.031 --> 00:01:52.672]  I don't know.
[00:02:13.593 --> 00:02:33.173]  As agitated passengers learn too late they can't get through security, the Department of Homeland Security's website reveals that starting on October 10, visitors seeking access to military bases and almost all federal facilities using their state-issued driver's licenses or ID cards
[00:02:33.473 --> 00:02:39.477]  Must present proper identification issued by real ID compliant states.
[00:02:39.898 --> 00:02:48.864]  DHS continues to be clear this update does not affect identification shown at the airports in the United States until announced otherwise.
[00:02:49.184 --> 00:02:56.109]  The TSA will continue to accept valid driver's license and ID cards issued by all states.
[00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:11.521]  DHS plans to announce the schedule for any changes to air travel requirements by the end of the year and will ensure that state governments and the traveling public are notified at least 120 days in advance of implementation.
[00:03:11.821 --> 00:03:19.906]  In the very near and real future, a real-life controlled matrix where transportation is no longer an individual right.
[00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:34.035]  CNN reports, Ford says the newest edition of its X-Maxx car has a new technology that scans traffic signs and adjusts the throttle to help drivers stay within legal speed limits and avoid fines.
[00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:37.477]  But the automated cars won't be obeying the speed limits.
[00:03:37.837 --> 00:03:38.878]  BBC reports,
[00:03:39.238 --> 00:03:48.308]  Google's self-driving cars are programmed to exceed speed limits by up to 10 miles per hour, according to the project's lead software engineer.
[00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:59.681]  Dmitry Dolgov told Reuters that when surrounding vehicles were breaking the speed limit, going more slowly could actually present a danger, and the Google car would accelerate to keep up.
[00:04:00.162 --> 00:04:08.529]  Of course, Google just wants you pesky humans to know that all 16 and counting reported self-driving car accidents weren't their fault.
[00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.795]  It was the fault of those meddling humans that reek of racial guilt and outdated individual freedom.
[00:04:15.075 --> 00:04:23.283]  The Daily Mail reports, Google's self-driving car has been involved in several accidents since it was launched, all caused by humans, its testers claim.
[00:04:23.803 --> 00:04:36.226]  Driving a big, beautiful speed demon anywhere you want without Big Brother sitting in the passenger seat is simply one of those fading American rights that should awaken even the most jaded American mind.
[00:04:36.666 --> 00:04:52.030]  Freedom to move when, how, and where you want to in the United States is priceless until the socialistic, communistic, corpocratic New World Order buys up that freedom and hands it over to their next installed puppet dictator with a big red bow on it.
[00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:59.755]  I suppose jolly old Nick better get his self-driving sleigh upgraded so the NSA can check their list to make sure if he's been naughty or nice.
[00:05:00.035 --> 00:05:01.896]  John Baum for InfoWars.com
[00:05:10.672 --> 00:05:16.776]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:20.118]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:05:20.138 --> 00:05:20.898]  Here we go, folks!
[00:05:20.978 --> 00:05:21.839]  I'm being assaulted!
[00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:28.063]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:05:28.223 --> 00:05:34.146]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:38.048]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:05:38.248 --> 00:05:41.149]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:49.313]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:05:49.593 --> 00:05:51.634]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:05:51.694 --> 00:05:52.755]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:05:53.095 --> 00:06:01.838]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
