[00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.951]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:26.213]  It is Monday, February 16, 2015, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:26.473 --> 00:00:27.733]  Here are tonight's top stories.
[00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:36.437]  Tonight, Egypt retaliates against reported ISIS attacks.
[00:00:36.957 --> 00:00:40.718]  Then, are robot cops coming to a city near you?
[00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.020]  And hashtag ILoveObama trends on Twitter.
[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.042]  That's next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:51.370]  So what if there's two quadrillion in derivatives?
[00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.132]  So what if we're having a war with Russia?
[00:00:53.272 --> 00:00:54.753]  So what if we're funding Al Qaeda?
[00:00:54.913 --> 00:00:57.556]  So what if they're opening the borders up and ignoring the law?
[00:00:57.716 --> 00:00:59.438]  So what if they shut off our power plants?
[00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:06.705]  So what if they carry on... The ISIS terror group released another video on Sunday showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians.
[00:01:08.727 --> 00:01:21.493]  The Islamic State's Al-Hayat Media, which is the group that has published the previous beheading videos, produced this Libya video and it's titled, A Message Signed with Blood to the Nation of the Cross.
[00:01:22.213 --> 00:01:26.435]  The Egyptian government and the Coptic Church did confirm the authenticity of this footage.
[00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:34.559]  It showed the workers all wearing orange jumpsuits and being beheaded near a waterfront that was said to be located in the Libyan province of Tripoli.
[00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.904]  The men were seized in two attacks in December and January from Libya.
[00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:49.935]  Libya has largely fallen into lawlessness and civil war because of a US-led effort to depose the late autocrat Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
[00:01:51.577 --> 00:02:13.395]  But in retaliation for the kidnapping and beheading of these 21 Egyptian Christians, the Egyptian Air Force has launched airstrikes, and they say they have killed between 40 and 50 ISIL militants, and the Egyptian president said that Cairo reserves the right to respond in any way after these brutal killings.
[00:02:13.975 --> 00:02:20.721]  A U.S.-led coalition that's comprising more than 60 countries is currently conducting airstrikes against the militants.
[00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:24.965]  But in addition to airstrikes, the U.S.
[00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:27.167]  is going to be putting boots on the ground.
[00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:27.908]  Yes, indeed.
[00:02:28.308 --> 00:02:28.548]  U.S.
[00:02:28.588 --> 00:02:33.152]  troops are headed to Kuwait as ISIS's propaganda war heats up.
[00:02:33.673 --> 00:02:42.802]  Stars and Stripes reports that more than 4,000 Fort Carson soldiers with the 3rd Brigade Combat Team left Colorado for Kuwait last week.
[00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:44.803]  On Thursday, the U.S.
[00:02:44.883 --> 00:02:46.184]  ambassador to the U.N.
[00:02:46.544 --> 00:02:47.125]  said U.S.
[00:02:47.185 --> 00:02:50.387]  troops will not see combat in Syria and Iraq.
[00:02:50.787 --> 00:02:58.133]  She said, you have to get the Iraqis and ultimately the Syrian moderate opposition groups up so they can fight the fight on the ground.
[00:02:58.233 --> 00:02:59.754]  There has to be a fight on the ground.
[00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:03.096]  You can't do this by air, and everyone acknowledges that.
[00:03:03.176 --> 00:03:10.862]  So, of course, there are going to be boots on the ground, and she's basically just reaffirming that we will continue arming and training the rebels.
[00:03:11.682 --> 00:03:19.827]  Of course, you know, these are the same rebels who then turn around and we have to fight them with all of their newly adopted CIA training.
[00:03:20.527 --> 00:03:27.211]  You'll also recall that ISIS has captured the town of al-Baghdadi, which is just about five miles from where U.S.
[00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:32.233]  Marines were training Iraqi soldiers to also fight this fight on the ground.
[00:03:32.373 --> 00:03:34.995]  So we're still putting our troops at risk.
[00:03:35.735 --> 00:03:36.255]  I don't know.
[00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:54.226]  To American security.
[00:03:54.666 --> 00:04:03.533]  Now despite that fact, and despite this latest execution by ISIS, the President refuses to acknowledge that these men were Christians.
[00:04:03.673 --> 00:04:05.174]  He only calls them citizens.
[00:04:06.175 --> 00:04:14.602]  He said earlier when the Muslim Jihadists attack random people in a deli, that's what he called them, just a random attack.
[00:04:15.262 --> 00:04:19.584]  Now, this, of course, this deli was a kosher deli in a Jewish neighborhood.
[00:04:19.764 --> 00:04:21.045]  Doesn't seem very random there.
[00:04:21.085 --> 00:04:25.507]  He doesn't want to call it, you know, call it like it is when it's uncomfortable.
[00:04:25.928 --> 00:04:34.452]  Now, Congress's first Navy SEAL, Ryan Zink, says that President Obama's reckless attitude toward foreign policy provides fuel for terrorism.
[00:04:34.912 --> 00:04:36.253]  And he says this administration
[00:04:36.673 --> 00:04:43.220]  He wants to negotiate with terrorists and he puts on this friendly face when we have Americans being beheaded.
[00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:48.787]  And he's basically calling on us to empathize with them because of the Crusades.
[00:04:49.848 --> 00:04:54.172]  As if Christians now should bear the burden of their ancestors.
[00:04:54.713 --> 00:04:56.875]  But after ISIS killed American U.S.
[00:04:56.995 --> 00:05:06.641]  aid worker Kayla Mueller last week, Obama was smiling and he was taking selfies with a selfie stick and just trying to be, you know, hip with the millennials.
[00:05:07.002 --> 00:05:11.725]  I mean, I guess that's better than going for a round of golf directly after one of these videos.
[00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:23.075]  But even though the president is clearly out of touch with what's going on in the rest of the world, he's very good at putting off that folksy attitude that the kids really like.
[00:05:23.295 --> 00:05:25.417]  So that he can be hip with the youth.
[00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.021]  This is why so many people are still drinking the Kool-Aid.
[00:05:29.301 --> 00:05:32.504]  This was actually trending on Twitter last night.
[00:05:32.824 --> 00:05:35.446]  Hashtag, I love Obama.
[00:05:36.147 --> 00:06:03.584]  Now it was supposed to be an effort for leftists to show their love and appreciation for dear leader President Obama, but of course it was quickly taken over by people pointing out that Americans are being beheaded, our troops are at risk, we're 18 trillion dollars in debt, but all of these people are obsessed with this man, they say it's a mental disorder, now into a full-on cult.
[00:06:04.304 --> 00:06:10.228]  But just what else has the president done to be so worthy of this occult-like worship?
[00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:13.170]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:23.337]  Now a local Fox affiliate out of San Diego, Fox 5, accidentally depicts President Obama as a rape suspect in last night's 10 o'clock news.
[00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:28.901]  The only suspect in a sex assault at SDSU will not be charged.
[00:06:29.321 --> 00:06:32.083]  Maybe Fox actually got something right for once.
[00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:36.486]  Let's talk about all the different ways that President Obama has raped America.
[00:06:36.886 --> 00:06:38.968]  Is this news editing mistake a Freudian slip?
[00:06:39.668 --> 00:06:44.492]  Are we being gaslighted to subconsciously capitulate our awareness to the rapist-in-chief?
[00:06:45.232 --> 00:06:53.578]  Since taking office as the 44th President of the United States, President Barack Hussein Obama has forcibly violated what was left of our constitutional rights.
[00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:57.221]  The National Defense Authorization Act grants his office the power
[00:06:57.541 --> 00:07:05.268]  Section 1071 of the version of the 2014 NDAA amplifies the range of surveillance established by the Patriot Act and the authorization for the use of military force.
[00:07:05.348 --> 00:07:09.551]  Obama's pillaging of our health care system raises a failing tax system on the poor
[00:07:24.063 --> 00:07:27.306]  And delivers a heavy final blow to the struggling middle class.
[00:07:27.806 --> 00:07:38.835]  His hugely unpopular open border policy threatens the very security of the United States as ISIS has clearly shown the ability to slip into America undetected.
[00:07:39.435 --> 00:07:49.723]  Meanwhile, known terror cells train within the United States unmolested, while you and I have our private parts funneled by the TSA just to get on an airplane in the land of the free.
[00:07:50.504 --> 00:07:57.288]  He lied to the American people just like a predator when he claimed that Bush's raising of our debt was irresponsible and unpatriotic.
[00:07:57.868 --> 00:08:07.253]  Then turned around and assaulted our wallets by skyrocketing the debt by another 7.3 trillion dollars while blowing millions on his golf games and vacations.
[00:08:07.693 --> 00:08:18.219]  He promised an end to the war while advancing the New World Order's agenda forward in Benghazi, Syria, Libya, Egypt, and even right here at home by supporting rhetoric that fuels a racist division.
[00:08:18.659 --> 00:08:23.522]  His war on journalists and whistleblowers, bankers, and friends that got too close is insatiable.
[00:08:24.123 --> 00:08:38.632]  Michael Hastings, Tom Clancy, Andrew Breitbart, Michael Cormier, Loretta Feudy, Harold Green, Barnaby Jack, Christopher Kelly, Albert Peterson, these are just a few of the names, all met with suspicious ends to their threats to his power.
[00:08:39.092 --> 00:08:45.116]  And now his vicious, unprecedented aggression is aimpoint blank at the last remaining vestige of free speech,
[00:08:45.556 --> 00:08:45.776]  I think?
[00:09:04.222 --> 00:09:05.643]  Alright, I'll go get my rape stool.
[00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:43.002]  Not that geoengineering exists, but a geoengineering researcher came out to talk about a mysterious phone call he received that was asking whether foreign countries could be triggering droughts or flooding.
[00:09:43.442 --> 00:09:56.369]  This is Professor Alan Robach from Rutgers University, and he said, consultants working for the CIA rang and said, we'd like to know, if someone is controlling the world's climate, would we know about it?
[00:09:56.809 --> 00:10:02.210]  And of course, they were also asking, if we control someone else's climate, would they then know about it?
[00:10:02.831 --> 00:10:07.732]  Now, the professor is just one of many who are studying geoengineering to combat climate change.
[00:10:08.032 --> 00:10:20.555]  But of course, he's expressing concern over the ability to manipulate the weather and use it as a weapon, which is very ironic considering it's the CIA who has been guilty of using weaponized weather in the past.
[00:10:21.075 --> 00:10:34.625]  During the Vietnam War, clouds were seeded over a supply route footpath to make it muddy and impassable, and the CIA also seeded clouds over Cuba to make it rain and ruin the sugar harvest.
[00:10:35.306 --> 00:10:40.950]  The use of weather as a weapon was banned under the Environmental Modification Convention in 1978.
[00:10:43.832 --> 00:10:46.133]  A recent report that was published by the U.S.
[00:10:46.194 --> 00:10:51.737]  National Academy of Sciences lists the spy agency as one of its research sponsors.
[00:10:52.077 --> 00:10:57.320]  So they're obviously still very interested in the use of weaponized weather.
[00:10:57.921 --> 00:11:04.244]  But the thing that's curious is, is the CIA concerned about another country currently controlling the weather?
[00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:12.990]  Of course, that would explain why we're having record snowfall, even though they're still trying to push out this global warming propaganda.
[00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:32.398]  And I think it's really great that this professor came out and alerted people to this mysterious phone call because he says this research has to be open and international so there isn't any question of using it for hostile purposes because he's quite aware of other instances where the CIA had done that in the past.
[00:11:33.098 --> 00:11:36.660]  Coming up right after this, robo-cops are set to hit the streets by 2016.
[00:11:37.161 --> 00:11:39.662]  Yeah, you heard that right.
[00:11:39.983 --> 00:11:46.667]  But taking us out to break, here is a little snippet from the upcoming film by John Massaria, Behind Truth Art.
[00:11:46.747 --> 00:11:55.253]  It features Anthony Frida's work, and this is a clip of the Mobius Strip, which depicts perpetual war sponsored by our government.
[00:11:55.273 --> 00:11:57.494]  There's a whole bunch of guys right there.
[00:11:57.715 --> 00:11:58.175]  We're doing it.
[00:11:58.215 --> 00:11:59.376]  We'll be engaging.
[00:11:59.396 --> 00:12:00.837]  Do you know what a Mobius Strip is?
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.383]  Our men and women in uniform continue to fight against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria.
[00:12:06.804 --> 00:12:13.548]  If I took this strip of paper... More than 2,000 coalition airstrikes have pounded these terrorists.
[00:12:13.569 --> 00:12:23.736]  ...twisted and wrapped it half around... Now make no mistake, this is a difficult mission.
[00:12:24.837 --> 00:12:26.398]  And it will remain difficult for some time.
[00:12:27.748 --> 00:12:32.092]  It's going to take time to dislodge these terrorists, especially from urban areas.
[00:12:37.096 --> 00:12:43.581]  Connected the ends together, in a sort of a circle.
[00:12:44.322 --> 00:12:51.368]  I do not believe America's interests are served by endless war, or by remaining on a perpetual war footing.
[00:12:51.388 --> 00:12:55.912]  If I ran my finger all the way around, I'd get back to the other side.
[00:12:59.867 --> 00:13:00.848]  The Mobius Strip.
[00:13:01.688 --> 00:13:02.329]  You understand?
[00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.651]  Hey, Freddy!
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.962]  The knowledge of the ancients.

[00:14:26.381 --> 00:14:32.144]  Use since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:14:32.484 --> 00:14:44.791]  Introducing the new InfoWarsLife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation, a highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:14:45.011 --> 00:14:50.235]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:14:50.535 --> 00:14:56.118]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:14:56.499 --> 00:15:01.302]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[00:15:01.442 --> 00:15:05.064]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:15:05.385 --> 00:15:11.609]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:16.977]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:15:17.137 --> 00:15:20.703]  Now available in our limited first run at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:15:20.863 --> 00:15:22.766]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:15:26.758 --> 00:15:30.762]  Robocops are here and they're set to be patrolling your streets by 2016.
[00:15:31.643 --> 00:15:33.625]  I am serious.
[00:15:34.126 --> 00:15:43.856]  Now, these humanoid robots are currently controlled remotely by a person wearing an Oculus Rift headset and motion tracking vest, armbands, and gloves.
[00:15:44.296 --> 00:15:46.879]  The voice of the robot operator is transmitted
[00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:51.101]  through the robot to the unfortunate citizen on the receiving end.
[00:15:51.561 --> 00:15:54.443]  Now, the menacing look of Telebot is no accident.
[00:15:54.843 --> 00:15:59.646]  Its design is one that can intimidate and display a sense of authority.
[00:16:00.306 --> 00:16:03.408]  A fully autonomous RoboCop is already in the works.
[00:16:03.728 --> 00:16:05.709]  This is the Nightscope K5.
[00:16:06.009 --> 00:16:12.133]  It does not wield weapons, but it serves as a total surveillance machine for cops or private clients.
[00:16:12.173 --> 00:16:16.415]  It has facial recognition and scans 1,500 license plates per minute.
[00:16:16.835 --> 00:16:17.796]  We're good to go.
[00:16:32.313 --> 00:16:41.598]  So hopefully they'll be able to do that a little bit better than our current law enforcement, which, as we know, people are getting killed for completely normal activities that they deem suspicious.
[00:16:42.118 --> 00:16:51.463]  So these Dalek-like robots will be recording people's actions and conversations in public places all over the place in just a few years.
[00:16:52.023 --> 00:16:57.846]  And of course, will these robots be given a license to kill without fear of prosecution?
[00:16:58.286 --> 00:17:08.351]  Now, we're already seeing a lot of people calling for rights to be given to robots after Boston Dynamics released this video of their new robotic dog.
[00:17:08.811 --> 00:17:16.815]  Online critics were saying that this robot dog, which was being kicked around repeatedly by employees, they were just wanting to show its dexterity.
[00:17:17.355 --> 00:17:25.784]  But people online were saying that the robot dog was being mistreated and that it was cruel and wrong and potentially unethical.
[00:17:26.424 --> 00:17:29.627]  So we're already seeing that with this robotic dog.
[00:17:29.747 --> 00:17:33.051]  What happens when AI is able to have an empathy?
[00:17:33.251 --> 00:17:33.772]  We're good to go.
[00:17:49.355 --> 00:17:54.117]  Google's vice president has warned internet users of a coming dark age.
[00:17:54.477 --> 00:18:00.880]  This will be a digital dark age and he tells users to print out treasured photographs or risk losing them forever.
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:13.545]  He said because so much data is now kept in digital format, future generations will struggle to understand our society because technology is advancing so quickly that old files will be inaccessible.
[00:18:14.065 --> 00:18:19.986]  Future generations will wonder about us, but they will have very great difficulty knowing anything about us.
[00:18:20.506 --> 00:18:27.228]  Now, Mr. Cerf said that there was a huge problem with the ability to preserve and run software over long periods of time.
[00:18:27.628 --> 00:18:34.389]  There's a great burden, he says, to find a way to create digital formats that can still be accessed in thousands of years.
[00:18:34.929 --> 00:18:39.170]  And he's recommending the creation of a system which will not only store a digital format,
[00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:47.933]  But preserve details of the software and the operating system that's needed to access it so it can be recreated in the future.
[00:18:48.653 --> 00:18:52.575]  But scientists are already working on the ultimate hard drive.
[00:18:52.915 --> 00:18:59.277]  They say that they're going to be storing data inside of DNA which could last for millions of years.
[00:18:59.757 --> 00:19:06.780]  Now the potential for DNA to be used for data storage has been discussed for years but it's not the most reliable currently and it's
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:14.505]  It's kind of difficult to extract that data, but the latest breakthrough could be about to change all of that.
[00:19:15.085 --> 00:19:22.410]  Now, in the past, retrieving data encoded in genes proved tricky because there would be gaps and false information in that encoded data.
[00:19:23.071 --> 00:19:29.635]  But scientists then incorporated an error correction that was similar to what is currently used in laptops and telephones.
[00:19:30.016 --> 00:19:35.580]  They overlapped DNA, basically making three backups of every single strand.
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:40.385]  And on top of that, scientists have now been inspired by fossils.
[00:19:40.825 --> 00:19:50.397]  Researchers from Zurich encased DNA in a fossil shell, and they subjected these shells, or silica spheres, to extreme temperatures.
[00:19:50.717 --> 00:19:54.842]  This is what happens to DNA, it's the chemical degradation that you'll see
[00:19:55.983 --> 00:19:56.604]  I think so.
[00:20:17.478 --> 00:20:19.159]  DNA of DNA data storage.
[00:20:19.239 --> 00:20:24.503]  Just one gram of DNA can store the equivalent of 14,000 Blu-ray discs.
[00:20:25.003 --> 00:20:30.747]  And theoretically, 100 million hours of high-def video could be stored on just a cup full of DNA.
[00:20:31.088 --> 00:20:35.310]  This amounts to every single television show and movie that's ever been created.
[00:20:35.991 --> 00:20:42.816]  And, they say, a DNA archive doesn't require a constant supply of electric power like hard disks do.
[00:20:43.416 --> 00:20:48.762]  So how wonderful, can you even believe it, we're going to be starting to store our data on DNA.
[00:20:49.022 --> 00:20:57.051]  The scientists say that if it was to be injected currently into a human subject, it would just dissolve because it's not that natural material.
[00:20:57.732 --> 00:21:02.377]  But if they could, I mean it would be like that scene in The Matrix where Neo is able to learn
[00:21:02.938 --> 00:21:05.902]  How to kick ass just by downloading the software.
[00:21:06.382 --> 00:21:09.926]  That would be pretty amazing, but there's also some other implications.
[00:21:10.107 --> 00:21:15.753]  I mean, they could literally rewrite history and then upload that into our DNA.
[00:21:16.294 --> 00:21:19.197]  I mean, there's just no telling what they're going to do in the future.
[00:21:19.938 --> 00:21:28.732]  Now coming up, John Bowne is going to investigate the continuation of the CIA's supposedly discontinued MKUltra program.
[00:21:29.213 --> 00:21:33.419]  It exists in the form of AI chatbots.
[00:21:35.512 --> 00:21:42.474]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.
[00:21:42.714 --> 00:21:52.037]  At InfoWars Life, our mission is to bring you the highest quality, purest, cleanest, effective colloidal silver on the market today for the lowest price available.

[00:22:35.274 --> 00:22:40.280]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:46.627]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:22:46.848 --> 00:22:53.816]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:22:54.136 --> 00:23:04.082]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:23:04.662 --> 00:23:10.585]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:23:10.805 --> 00:23:13.987]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and
[00:23:14.227 --> 00:23:14.788]  We're good to go.
[00:23:45.423 --> 00:23:55.451]  I give the CIA a total credit for sponsoring and initiating the entire consciousness movement counterculture events of the 1960s.
[00:23:55.851 --> 00:24:11.183]  Psychological warfare is described by Webster's Dictionary as the use of propaganda, threats, and other psychological techniques to mislead, intimidate, demoralize, or otherwise influence the thinking or behavior of an opponent.
[00:24:11.543 --> 00:24:14.706]  The Nazis referred to it as the worldview attack.
[00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:16.111]  I speak.
[00:24:16.593 --> 00:24:19.625]  All young men, brave men, homeward bound.
[00:24:20.236 --> 00:24:26.381]  ...to take up the challenge of that future, which they did so much to salvage from the brink of disaster.
[00:24:26.841 --> 00:24:45.595]  After the Allied victory in Europe of World War II on May 8, 1945, the Office of Strategic Services, the intelligence agency formed during World War II, conducted Operation Paperclip, a program in which over 1,500 Nazi German scientists, technicians and engineers were smuggled into the United States.
[00:24:46.195 --> 00:24:54.084]  President Truman's order concerning Operation Paperclip expressly excluded anyone even remotely associated with the Nazi Party.
[00:24:54.444 --> 00:25:01.692]  However, the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency, a subcommittee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, expunged from public record
[00:25:02.012 --> 00:25:05.413]  All Nazi Party affiliations in regards to the German scientists.
[00:25:05.773 --> 00:25:10.015]  From this exodus of evil sprung a variety of mind control operations.
[00:25:10.355 --> 00:25:26.481]  The Central Intelligence Agency succeeded the Office of Strategic Services during World War II as a result of the National Security Act of 1947, which granted the CIA no police or law enforcement functions either at home or abroad.
[00:25:26.761 --> 00:25:33.503]  To coordinate secret espionage activities against the Axis powers for the branches of the United States Armed Forces.
[00:25:33.943 --> 00:25:41.124]  Secretly, Project Chatter was conducted in order to identify agents synthetic and natural that could enhance interrogation.
[00:25:41.625 --> 00:25:47.146]  Project Bluebird experimented with the possibility of using humans as mind-controlled warfare agents.
[00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:57.503]  CIA Director Alan Dulles was quoted as complaining that they did not have enough human guinea pigs to try these extraordinary techniques.
[00:25:58.224 --> 00:26:01.429]  Thus, officially, the MKUltra project was sanctioned in 1953.
[00:26:03.311 --> 00:26:03.971]  We're good to go.
[00:26:23.397 --> 00:26:32.424]  was paid $69,000 per year from 1957 to 1964 to carry out MKUltra experiments in Canada for the CIA.
[00:26:32.744 --> 00:26:42.492]  His mind-erasing experiments conducted on patients with minor problems such as anxiety disorders and depression without their consent caused long-term damage.
[00:26:43.013 --> 00:26:48.477]  But his research also pioneered the CIA's two-stage psychological torture method.
[00:26:49.057 --> 00:26:55.519]  If you want to preserve your power indefinitely, you have to get the consent of the ruled.
[00:26:56.099 --> 00:27:07.262]  And this they will do, partly by drugs, as I foresaw in Brave New World, partly by these new techniques of propaganda.
[00:27:08.163 --> 00:27:16.305]  They will do it by bypassing the sort of rational side of man, and appealing to his subconscious and his deeper emotions,
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:24.106]  And his physiology, even, and so making him actually love his slavery.
[00:27:24.166 --> 00:27:34.515]  I mean, I think this is the danger, that actually people may be, in some ways, happy under the new regime, but they will be happy in situations where they oughtn't to be happy.
[00:27:34.966 --> 00:27:36.767]  Human experimentation on the U.S.
[00:27:36.808 --> 00:27:59.626]  population finally creeped into the public eye when in the summer of 1975, Congressional Church Committee reports revealed to the public for the first time that the CIA and the Department of Defense had conducted experiments on both unwitting and cognizant human subjects as part of a huge program to control human behavior through the use of psychoactive drugs.
[00:27:59.786 --> 00:28:03.489]  In 1973, due to the widespread panic caused by Watergate,
[00:28:04.232 --> 00:28:05.674]  Just think how much you're going to be messing.
[00:28:06.855 --> 00:28:08.817]  You don't have Nixon to kick around anymore.
[00:28:09.197 --> 00:28:13.622]  CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MKUltra files destroyed.
[00:28:14.063 --> 00:28:16.365]  Most of those documents were destroyed.
[00:28:16.585 --> 00:28:26.416]  However, bureaucratic red tape bungling allowed 20,000 documents to survive, as they had been incorrectly stored in a financial records building.
[00:28:27.034 --> 00:28:32.322]  We are not professing to tell you the complete story of these activities.
[00:28:32.863 --> 00:28:35.827]  We are professing to tell you the complete story that we know.
[00:28:36.488 --> 00:28:40.114]  But these records that we've uncovered don't tell the story.
[00:28:40.134 --> 00:28:41.155]  They tell pieces of it.
[00:28:41.275 --> 00:28:42.517]  President Gerald Ford
[00:28:43.138 --> 00:28:57.849]  Issued the first executive order on intelligence activities in 1976 prohibiting experimentation with drugs on human subjects except with the informed consent in writing and witnessed by a disinterested party.
[00:28:58.189 --> 00:29:06.996]  Subsequent orders by President Carter and President Reagan focused in on the directive that applies to any human experimentation.
[00:29:07.396 --> 00:29:10.459]  We have quite a lot of detailed information
[00:29:12.127 --> 00:29:29.475]  And we will evaluate it and we will include any evidence of wrongdoing or any evidence of impropriety in our final report and make recommendations.
[00:29:29.844 --> 00:29:34.107]  The abandonment of the CIA's MKULTRA program appears to be a hoax.
[00:29:34.547 --> 00:29:42.073]  Recent declassified documents reveal the CIA's interrogation tests involving one of their own unwitting agents with an AI computer.
[00:29:42.653 --> 00:29:50.379]  This virtual interrogator from 1983 paved the way to carry out AI chatbot interviews with an unknowing public.
[00:29:50.759 --> 00:29:58.045]  The techniques of interrogation, control, and mental manipulation have been brought into the modern world on a global scale.
[00:29:58.445 --> 00:30:08.313]  Sky Titus Maitreya claims to have been led into MKUltra sexual slavery by a chatbot she engaged with as a teenager residing in Minnesota.
[00:30:08.673 --> 00:30:14.618]  They wanted me to be the last piece of this concoction of chaos that they're creating.
[00:30:14.638 --> 00:30:17.621]  They wanted these people to play the role of neo-pagan gods.
[00:30:18.001 --> 00:30:27.372]  And then so they're brainwashing them to like fill certain roles and then there's another day when I was going through the sexual programming they like had these seven demons coming to me and it was a form of hypnosis.
[00:30:27.512 --> 00:30:34.479]  They were like directing me where to go and keeping me like conscious and telling me to stay alert and all these different things so I'm like being programmed in some kind of like
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:35.620]  I think so.
[00:30:56.334 --> 00:30:59.337]  Now AI chatbots litter the internet.
[00:30:59.537 --> 00:31:00.238]  Could be worse.
[00:31:00.538 --> 00:31:11.267]  As MKUltra slave numbers quietly rise and our political leaders become increasingly corrupt, we may never see another investigation on the scale and scope of the Church investigation.
[00:31:11.548 --> 00:31:21.557]  Do you think that the CIA and military intelligence agencies and the FBI have used the emergency provisions both in law and by emergency agency
[00:31:22.057 --> 00:31:25.378]  To have contingency plans which threaten the liberty of American citizens.
[00:31:25.778 --> 00:31:31.259]  The United States government has perfected a technological capability.
[00:31:31.779 --> 00:31:36.420]  At the same time, that capability at any time could be turned around on the American people.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:43.901]  There would be no place to hide the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government.
[00:31:44.702 --> 00:31:49.242]  Could enable it to impose total tyranny.
[00:31:49.583 --> 00:31:51.463]  John Bowne, Infowars.com

[00:32:33.978 --> 00:32:43.705]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:32:44.025 --> 00:32:47.728]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:32:48.308 --> 00:32:52.993]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:32:53.373 --> 00:32:59.599]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
