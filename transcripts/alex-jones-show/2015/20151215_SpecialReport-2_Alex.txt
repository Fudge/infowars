[00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:16.235]  Obama and company would have us all believe that gun ownership must be heavily regulated.
[00:00:16.876 --> 00:00:22.881]  These comments stem from a fabricated culture of fear to be believed by our Big Daddy government.
[00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:29.447]  Sorry kids, it turns out Big Daddy is a compulsive liar as gun sales have gone up.
[00:00:29.907 --> 00:00:32.350]  Gun violence has gone down.
[00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:35.575]  Well, unless you're counting Big Daddy's gun-free zones.
[00:00:35.915 --> 00:00:41.563]  Mother Jones Magazine did their best to attempt to point out that gun violence victims were increasing.
[00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:47.311]  Problem is, that data was gathered exclusively from gun-free zones.
[00:00:47.751 --> 00:01:00.963]  According to the Washington Post, in 1993 there were seven homicides by firearm for every 100,000 Americans, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
[00:01:01.243 --> 00:01:04.726]  By 2013, that figure had fallen by nearly half.
[00:01:05.306 --> 00:01:10.510]  to 3.6 a total of 11,208 firearm homicides.
[00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:19.836]  The number of victims of crimes involving guns that did not result in death such as robberies declined even more precipitously from 725 per 100,000 people in 1993 to 175 in 2013.
[00:01:19.896 --> 00:01:22.197]  In 2008 the Supreme Court ruled in District of Columbia versus Heller
[00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:37.108]  That individual firearm possession is constitutionally protected, especially when it comes to self-defense.
[00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:43.714]  And as the gun crime victims numbers decreased, American gun ownership began to skyrocket.
[00:01:44.034 --> 00:01:52.261]  President Obama's rhetoric and life-threatening policies have served to sell over a hundred million guns since he took office.
[00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:54.863]  I guess some things do happen overnight.
[00:01:55.043 --> 00:01:56.225]  It's not going to happen overnight.
[00:01:56.345 --> 00:02:00.330]  Change cannot happen overnight, and the changes we seek won't always happen overnight.
[00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.214]  The economic challenges that we face weren't created overnight.
[00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:06.798]  They're not going to be solved overnight.
[00:02:06.818 --> 00:02:09.301]  A crisis this deep didn't happen overnight.
[00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:11.463]  Nothing worth doing happens overnight.
[00:02:11.604 --> 00:02:13.526]  We should not expect change to happen overnight.
[00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:14.867]  I don't think it's going to happen overnight.
[00:02:15.087 --> 00:02:20.491]  Regardless, the totalitarian left continues to threaten our Second Amendment rights.
[00:02:20.651 --> 00:02:27.016]  What these latest incidents in Colorado and now California raises two questions.
[00:02:27.597 --> 00:02:31.520]  One, are we mature enough as a country to look in the mirror and say we have a gun problem?
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.782]  You know, a 12-step program starts with, you gotta acknowledge you have a problem.
[00:02:35.842 --> 00:02:38.223]  Are we mature enough to acknowledge that?
[00:02:38.503 --> 00:02:43.546]  A treasonous shadow government shows their illegal hand by the very policies they set forth.
[00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:54.432]  Case in point, Obama begged from the Oval Office to administer an unconstitutional no-fly list while opening the floodgates for potential terrorists to enter the United States.
[00:02:54.832 --> 00:02:58.374]  As of 2013, the no-fly list included
[00:02:59.174 --> 00:03:04.580]  47,000 people, up from 16 people after George W. Bush created it.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.542]  American residents and U.S.
[00:03:06.602 --> 00:03:10.146]  veterans have routinely been put on the list by mistake.
[00:03:10.326 --> 00:03:15.832]  To begin with, Congress should act to make sure no one on a no-fly list is able to buy a gun.
[00:03:16.152 --> 00:03:27.676]  Today the ACLU was in a federal court arguing that people on the list cannot access the full evidence against them, receive a hearing, or cross-examine witnesses against them.
[00:03:27.996 --> 00:03:31.677]  Analysts are saying that the ACLU may actually win this thing.
[00:03:31.897 --> 00:03:36.619]  According to the rights granted by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, they already have.
[00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:43.321]  The lunacy behind the no-fly list should have put the Bush administration under the jail years ago.
[00:03:43.641 --> 00:03:45.522]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:03:54.292 --> 00:04:00.395]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forward situation?
[00:04:00.415 --> 00:04:03.777]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:04:03.857 --> 00:04:05.478]  Here we go folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[00:04:05.518 --> 00:04:11.761]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:17.744]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the pants on the streets?
