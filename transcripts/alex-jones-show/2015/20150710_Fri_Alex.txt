[00:00:00.914 --> 00:00:03.503]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:16.972]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.652 --> 00:00:18.673]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:19.414 --> 00:00:20.515]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:21.977]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.758 --> 00:00:23.639]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.299 --> 00:00:27.943]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.504 --> 00:00:32.548]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:38.812]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, July 10, 2015.
[00:00:40.813 --> 00:00:42.374]  I'm David Knight, your host in Austin.
[00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:45.435]  Alex is going to be joining us in the next segment.
[00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:48.637]  He's got a special report on Vatican coup.
[00:00:49.337 --> 00:00:52.298]  Yeah, we're rushing headlong into world government.
[00:00:52.398 --> 00:00:57.161]  And of course, one of the people who's taken point now is the new Pope.
[00:00:57.781 --> 00:00:58.521]  I guess he's not new.
[00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:00.742]  I guess he's been there a couple of years now.
[00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:02.023]  But what is new?
[00:01:02.703 --> 00:01:02.984]  Yes.
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.781]  And again, I'm not a Catholic, so I can't speak to this, but I have some articles.
[00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:25.182]  We're going to talk about what conservative Catholics are concerned about with this.
[00:01:25.402 --> 00:01:33.204]  It's amazing to see the silence of the Pope when we have massive sea changes and things like the definition of the family.
[00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:36.485]  Not interested at all in that, what he is interested in.
[00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:51.855]  is restructuring the world in terms of economically and of course as you just saw there if you're watching the feed he was handed a hammer and sickle crucifix and South America was the Bolivian president
[00:01:52.768 --> 00:01:53.749]  Who handed this to him.
[00:01:54.209 --> 00:02:04.134]  And of course, it's a very appropriate symbolism because communism has always been as strong a persecutor of Christianity as anyone.
[00:02:04.254 --> 00:02:06.775]  I mean, they shut down Christianity.
[00:02:07.495 --> 00:02:12.598]  A very, very jealous god is Marxism and the people who have run it.
[00:02:13.118 --> 00:02:24.890]  And so to see Christ on a hammer and sickle is not surprising whatsoever and it's not surprising to see it given to this Pope because quite frankly what he is pushing is flat-out Marxism.
[00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.937]  Now they came back and said well the Pope was surprised by this and he really did not, it's not something that really reflects his ideology.
[00:02:33.718 --> 00:02:34.319]  Nonsense!
[00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.901]  Look at what he is saying and of course
[00:02:37.722 --> 00:02:49.967]  When the encyclical came out a couple of weeks ago, we pointed out that the scientist, who was one of the three presenters, the day before was also added to the Vatican's Scientific Advisory Council.
[00:02:50.547 --> 00:02:55.189]  This is a leading man in the field of climate alarmism.
[00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:00.751]  His name is Schellenhuber, he's German, and he has written papers calling
[00:03:01.351 --> 00:03:09.856]  for world government, a world constitution, a world body, a world council that would enforce all of this.
[00:03:09.876 --> 00:03:12.237]  And of course that's precisely what the Pope is saying as well.
[00:03:12.837 --> 00:03:13.498]  The Pope is saying
[00:03:14.386 --> 00:03:19.348]  We can't really control the multinational corporations with national governments anymore.
[00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:20.489]  That part is true.
[00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:21.429]  That's very true.
[00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.571]  So he says, so what we need is a world government to control the multinational corporations.
[00:03:26.252 --> 00:03:28.093]  He's got it exactly the opposite.
[00:03:28.313 --> 00:03:36.477]  It's the multinational corporations that are creating the world government using the national politicians as pawns.
[00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:37.958]  Using the Pope.
[00:03:38.558 --> 00:03:40.500]  Or as he's joining in with them willingly.
[00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:45.305]  Now, we also have this as part of Prince Charles has put together an Earth League.
[00:03:45.845 --> 00:03:49.969]  And you can see pictures of Prince Charles with his advisor Peter Schellenhuber.
[00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.451]  They're going to push this this year.
[00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:58.236]  This year they have some major economic, not economic, environmental conferences where they're going to try to
[00:03:59.451 --> 00:04:03.612]  Push climate change on everyone by a global regime.
[00:04:03.712 --> 00:04:07.893]  And of course, it's just one of the aspects where they're setting up global regimes.
[00:04:07.973 --> 00:04:14.355]  All the trade treaties that we see being negotiated in secret by these corporate lawyers that we're not allowed to be involved in.
[00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:16.296]  And there you can see the picture if you're watching at the feed.
[00:04:16.636 --> 00:04:19.076]  Over on the right-hand side is Peter Schellenhuber.
[00:04:19.416 --> 00:04:24.398]  And right there in the center of all this, as usual, is Prince Charles.
[00:04:24.518 --> 00:04:27.879]  The League of... The Earth League, I guess they call it.
[00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.981]  Remember that fiction story of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen?
[00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:38.665]  Well, these guys are not extraordinary gentlemen, but there are some Jekyll and Hydes in there, most definitely.
[00:04:38.705 --> 00:04:42.347]  But the mask is coming off, and we understand what this is about.
[00:04:42.787 --> 00:04:51.532]  It is flat-out corporatism leading to world government, just like the trade treaties that are being done in secret.
[00:04:51.852 --> 00:04:53.213]  Stay with us right after the break.
[00:04:53.253 --> 00:04:55.214]  We've got a special report from Alex Jones.
[00:04:55.734 --> 00:04:56.295]  Vatican coup.
[00:05:10.296 --> 00:05:12.878]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:05:13.138 --> 00:05:18.581]  First off, I'd like to say congratulations to Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina.
[00:05:18.741 --> 00:05:29.407]  She signed the paperwork to bring down the Confederate flag, thus ending racism and all random acts of violence from random people who take unprescribed drugs and go on killing sprees.
[00:05:29.747 --> 00:05:31.629]  You're a hero, FBI head.
[00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.832]  Terror panic is the new normal.
[00:05:34.312 --> 00:05:49.709]  Article up at Infowars.com by Steve Watson, FBI head James Comey said Thursday that the Bureau now considers the heightened state of terror alert and increased police presence in major cities enacted for the July 4th holiday as the new normal.
[00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:56.853]  Poll 1 in 10 British people support ISIS and shocking findings published by the Mirror newspaper.
[00:05:57.093 --> 00:06:05.118]  An ICM poll has revealed that 1 in 10 people in Britain regard themselves as supporters of the Islamic State terror group.
[00:06:05.438 --> 00:06:08.880]  You can find more articles like this at InfoWars.com
[00:06:10.174 --> 00:06:29.746]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[00:06:29.926 --> 00:06:30.346]  Well then,
[00:06:30.686 --> 00:06:34.350]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:35.992]  Hdfirearms.com.
[00:06:36.273 --> 00:06:39.496]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs and Special Ops people.
[00:06:39.596 --> 00:06:44.502]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[00:06:44.722 --> 00:06:45.423]  It's always about
[00:06:45.503 --> 00:06:45.723]  Thank you.

[00:07:22.752 --> 00:07:29.821]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:32.822]  Or because they're not 100% organic.
[00:07:32.962 --> 00:07:39.425]  Or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com.

[00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:23.949]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08:24.669 --> 00:08:31.134]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.175 --> 00:08:39.481]  Alex Jones here with an extremely important, in fact, urgent analysis and breakdown of what's happening currently.
[00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:56.265]  First off, everyone sees that the world is going through a lot of changes right now and that those changes are not for the best interest of the average person or for national sovereignty and individual free will.
[00:08:57.546 --> 00:09:14.291]  And out of this spectrum of events, escalating Middle East crises, Chinese stock meltdowns, the situation in Greece, amongst all of this we have governments trying to foment sectarian division, divide and conquer, racial division.
[00:09:14.672 --> 00:09:15.752]  What is behind it?
[00:09:18.217 --> 00:09:21.958]  We're about to break down exactly what is behind it today.
[00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:32.741]  We're going to point fingers, we're going to break down exactly who is pulling the strings, who is controlling the wheel of the global ship of state.
[00:09:34.401 --> 00:09:40.163]  The new Pope, who's been in power now for two years, elected by the Cardinals at the Vatican,
[00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:49.253]  has openly called for planetary government three weeks ago and now calling for planetary carbon taxes and wealth redistribution.
[00:09:50.254 --> 00:09:51.674]  What's really behind this?
[00:09:52.554 --> 00:10:05.218]  The fact that a Pope would come out and call for things reversing what Pope John Paul II and others talked about tells Catholics and non-Catholics alike everything we need to know.
[00:10:06.418 --> 00:10:11.120]  So we're about to go to the bottom of the rabbit hole here, ladies and gentlemen, and explain exactly what's happening.
[00:10:12.574 --> 00:10:18.517]  You can debate all day whether the Vatican and Catholic civilization has been a positive or negative thing throughout history.
[00:10:18.957 --> 00:10:22.699]  It's certainly been both, but you can debate whether it was more negative or more positive.
[00:10:23.439 --> 00:10:30.543]  But you cannot debate that the Catholic Church has been blackmailed, infiltrated, and taken over.
[00:10:31.143 --> 00:10:33.504]  We're about to break it all down right now.
[00:10:37.006 --> 00:10:37.786]  On February 11th, 2013,
[00:10:41.038 --> 00:10:46.861]  For the first time in modern history, in hundreds of years, a sitting Pope resigned.
[00:10:47.301 --> 00:10:47.981]  Pope Benedict.
[00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:50.622]  And he took off and flew away in his helicopter.
[00:10:51.343 --> 00:10:52.403]  And we weren't told why.
[00:10:52.423 --> 00:10:59.466]  Now there's a lot of different pieces to this, and I'm going to lay them out and let you make your own decision.
[00:11:00.306 --> 00:11:03.408]  But I've done deep research on the Globalists and their operations.
[00:11:03.428 --> 00:11:05.669]  I understand who they are, what their endgame is.
[00:11:07.017 --> 00:11:08.478]  And it's not one institution.
[00:11:08.618 --> 00:11:09.819]  It's not the Protestants.
[00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:10.699]  It's not the Catholics.
[00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:11.620]  It's not the Jews.
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.902]  It's not the Masons that run things.
[00:11:15.182 --> 00:11:19.885]  It is globalist controlling finance and central banking.
[00:11:21.294 --> 00:11:34.762]  manipulating nation states off against themselves and playing different existing power blocks off against themselves and through that synthesis they centralize power and are bringing in a corporate fascist world government.
[00:11:35.682 --> 00:11:45.788]  That's why the Rockefellers founded their modern Vatican, the UN, above the law with its own cities and different sectors that has diplomatic immunity.
[00:11:45.928 --> 00:11:47.109]  We're going to break that down in a moment.
[00:11:47.669 --> 00:11:50.571]  But regardless of where you stand on the whole Catholic issue
[00:11:52.353 --> 00:12:01.038]  Undoubtedly, they broke with all of Catholic history when they put a Jesuit in two years ago.
[00:12:01.078 --> 00:12:02.439]  That's against canon law.
[00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:10.164]  You can't have the Jesuits who are the police of the Catholic Church ever becoming a Pope because they would use it as a coup d'etat.
[00:12:10.564 --> 00:12:15.847]  Just like Caesar couldn't bring his troops into Rome because obviously he would make himself a dictator.
[00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:18.129]  It's very simple.
[00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.571]  It's why we have posse comitatus.
[00:12:21.231 --> 00:12:23.173]  So these are facts you can't deny.
[00:12:23.193 --> 00:12:38.962]  That A, he's a Jesuit, the new Pope, and that he is now saying things diametrically opposed to what Pope John Paul II and Pope Pius before him and everybody else said.
[00:12:39.423 --> 00:12:45.867]  That we're clearly anti-authoritarianism, anti-communist.
[00:12:46.863 --> 00:12:49.526]  And obviously the Catholic Church had its own corruption, its own problems.
[00:12:49.666 --> 00:12:50.426]  I'm not a Catholic.
[00:12:50.787 --> 00:12:51.908]  I'm not an apologist for it.
[00:12:52.789 --> 00:12:59.755]  It's just undoubtedly now, we have a pope when he first got in that said, leave abortion alone, quit harping on it.
[00:13:00.576 --> 00:13:02.077]  I mean, he might as well be Margaret Sanger.
[00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.721]  So if you want to understand what's happening, it's called blackmail.
[00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:07.002]  And then I'm going to get into it in a moment.
[00:13:08.573 --> 00:13:19.618]  The Catholic Church allowed itself to be clearly infiltrated, just like the military, just like public schools, just like so many other institutions, Congress, by pedophile networks.
[00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:26.842]  Who then, once they get somebody in, they then recruit unknowns like Dennis Hastert to then come in and fill their ranks.
[00:13:27.282 --> 00:13:29.003]  Then the people are totally compromised.
[00:13:29.583 --> 00:13:32.764]  And so there was a major pedophile scandal that the Catholic Church has been covering up for 30 years.
[00:13:34.645 --> 00:13:36.647]  The whole thing basically began to break.
[00:13:37.548 --> 00:14:01.526]  The operatives inside that were doing it were blowing the whistle on their own people to then be able to blackmail the Catholic Church into, at this critical point, bringing in the new Pope, who we're going to go over in a minute, who would then call for class warfare and what has been taught by the Communists for over a hundred years, liberation theology.
[00:14:02.932 --> 00:14:13.937]  And the reason this was done is they couldn't get the third world populations to sign on five years ago to the Copenhagen UN Climate Change Treaty that basically doubled taxes on the third world.
[00:14:14.737 --> 00:14:20.280]  They promised it as a wealth redistribution, but when the treaty came out, Lord Monckton got a copy of it, a good Catholic himself.
[00:14:21.681 --> 00:14:28.864]  It was absolute tyranny, neo-colonialism, IMF World Bank raping the third world that they've done over and over again.
[00:14:30.228 --> 00:14:32.509]  And of course, the IMF and World Bank support carbon taxes.
[00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:33.890]  The Vatican supports it.
[00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.031]  It's all the same club.
[00:14:35.471 --> 00:14:37.292]  Switzerland provides the Swiss Guards.
[00:14:38.412 --> 00:14:46.357]  This is a city above the law with untold wealth lecturing the middle class on how they need to pay more taxes to take care of poor people.
[00:14:46.977 --> 00:14:49.138]  As if the middle class doesn't already provide most of the jobs.
[00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:53.761]  So again, this is the Catholic Church breaking it down, completely blackmailed.
[00:14:54.998 --> 00:14:55.338]  I think?
[00:15:14.929 --> 00:15:17.952]  Who is Pope Francis, his taken name.
[00:15:18.452 --> 00:15:20.755]  He's a Jesuit, violating Catholic law on every front.
[00:15:21.515 --> 00:15:26.060]  Not allowed to do it, but he is now the, so he can't have a foreigner be the president, basically.
[00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:28.723]  Same deal, he can't have Obama be the head of the U.N.
[00:15:28.743 --> 00:15:31.786]  Security Council, but he became it, violating Article 1, Section 9.
[00:15:32.106 --> 00:15:33.127]  It's just all about treason.
[00:15:34.068 --> 00:15:35.409]  Now we have an article today on CNN.
[00:15:35.449 --> 00:15:40.892]  Pope calls world leaders cowards when he's one of the chief world leaders, pushing the EU, pushing all this.
[00:15:41.412 --> 00:15:56.260]  And he comes out and says a lot of things that sound reasonable on the surface, because they need to get the third world behind him, trusting him, so they can pass the global carbon tax treaty coming up in a few months in Paris, France, that openly creates world government.
[00:15:56.561 --> 00:15:58.842]  And remember, just three weeks ago, he called for world government.
[00:16:00.273 --> 00:16:01.674]  And so everyone's praising him.
[00:16:01.714 --> 00:16:03.155]  He says the system's corrupt.
[00:16:03.676 --> 00:16:04.877]  You know, it's hurting the earth.
[00:16:05.457 --> 00:16:06.958]  The ultra-rich banks are corrupt.
[00:16:06.978 --> 00:16:08.139]  These trade deals are corrupt.
[00:16:08.359 --> 00:16:09.000]  It's all true.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.764]  But when you read the fine print, the Vatican and him are supporting those deals.
[00:16:15.244 --> 00:16:18.567]  So again, it's rhetoric playing on the ignorance of the public.
[00:16:19.047 --> 00:16:21.889]  The Treaty of Rome in 1957 signed at the Vatican
[00:16:26.011 --> 00:16:33.596]  was pushed by the Vatican to help create the European Union to be a new super state that they basically controlled.
[00:16:34.857 --> 00:16:41.322]  And it was Jesuit operatives on record that helped set it up with the founder of it, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands.
[00:16:41.722 --> 00:16:42.883]  You can just look all this up.
[00:16:43.403 --> 00:16:48.567]  So again, he's criticizing globalism when the Vatican has been at the heart of it.
[00:16:49.447 --> 00:16:52.810]  And then right here at the last moment, it's not going to be capitalist, it's going to be communist.
[00:16:53.766 --> 00:16:54.506]  Let's continue.
[00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:56.287]  Breaking down the biggest secret.
[00:16:56.967 --> 00:17:03.270]  If you go to the Holy See, they explain that they're a sovereign nation above the law that can do whatever it wants.
[00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.212]  There's the official Vatican.va website.
[00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:08.673]  And then you have the city of London.
[00:17:09.133 --> 00:17:13.595]  Within London that's above the law, pays no taxes, is one of the richest cities on earth.
[00:17:13.995 --> 00:17:16.236]  It copies what the Vatican's doing.
[00:17:16.636 --> 00:17:17.637]  Who else copies that?
[00:17:18.604 --> 00:17:19.744]  Washington D.C.
[00:17:20.184 --> 00:17:25.465]  established after our country was set up, above the law, tax-exempt, doing whatever it wants.
[00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:33.987]  Again, the United Nations, set up by the Rockefellers, given land, tax-exempt, has major capitals in every major region, above the law.
[00:17:34.567 --> 00:17:35.547]  Diplomatic immunity.
[00:17:35.967 --> 00:17:39.808]  This is the model that they are using.
[00:17:39.888 --> 00:17:42.848]  This is the system that has been established.
[00:17:42.888 --> 00:17:46.029]  So regardless of how you see the Vatican, good or bad or in between,
[00:17:47.049 --> 00:18:04.241]  It is an above-the-law global system with unlimited history and research and spies and operatives with thousands of bank subsidiaries around the world with estimated over 1,000 trillion or a quadrillion dollars.
[00:18:05.021 --> 00:18:12.546]  And they've got this guy running around lecturing us about wealth redistribution because the ultra-rich are going to knock out any economies left.
[00:18:12.566 --> 00:18:16.409]  He wants to shut down oil drilling, everything to create a global collapse
[00:18:17.049 --> 00:18:28.251]  of austerity to bring in the answer a world government to it with the new Pope now calling for a one world religion to bring everyone together.
[00:18:28.831 --> 00:18:40.073]  I mean, either the Bible's coming true, Revelations and Daniel and all the rest of it and Ezekiel and what Christ said, or they're using it as a playbook to set up a planetary tyranny.
[00:18:40.513 --> 00:18:43.534]  Three global regions, ten sub-regions, the ten kings.
[00:18:44.474 --> 00:18:45.954]  This is over the top.
[00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:52.307]  And this new Pope is the most naked manipulator I've ever seen.
[00:18:52.367 --> 00:18:55.568]  He makes Obama look tame with his deception.
[00:18:56.288 --> 00:19:05.112]  And Catholics are reviled by it, people around the world are reviled by it, but also poor, desperate people everywhere hear him with promises of wealth redistribution, they buy into it.
[00:19:05.932 --> 00:19:10.674]  We know for the first time that a Pope from outside Europe was put in
[00:19:12.987 --> 00:19:14.687]  I wouldn't be against it if the guy wasn't a communist.
[00:19:15.508 --> 00:19:24.813]  That a pope who is a Jesuit that's illegal under Catholic law has been put in, and now he breaks with what the last ten popes were saying.
[00:19:25.513 --> 00:19:26.493]  I mean, somebody's wrong.
[00:19:26.513 --> 00:19:29.235]  Either those last people were horrible, or he's horrible.
[00:19:29.915 --> 00:19:32.397]  And folks are going to have to face this, they're going to have to deal with it.
[00:19:32.437 --> 00:19:43.887]  But the mere fact that you have a Pope doing this at this point, calling for a planetary government, again just three weeks ago, and calling for global wealth redistribution based on environmentalism, this isn't real environmentalism.
[00:19:43.907 --> 00:19:51.833]  This is the globalists tracking everything you do, bringing in feudalism to control you, a new dark age, and the Pope's, you know, saying climate change isn't the sun.
[00:19:51.853 --> 00:19:55.296]  That's back to saying that the, you know, Earth was the center of the universe.
[00:19:55.436 --> 00:19:56.637]  I mean, this is just too much.
[00:19:57.478 --> 00:20:02.201]  And so this just adds into the global meltdown and the crises we're seeing accelerate.
[00:20:04.483 --> 00:20:09.526]  It's unprecedented and we're going to be breaking it down on the radio here today.
[00:20:10.287 --> 00:20:13.989]  But it's clear that the Vatican has been completely taken over, whether it was good or bad before.
[00:20:14.409 --> 00:20:27.018]  It's completely run by Marxists now, who themselves work for big central bankers who are exempt from the high taxes, exempt from the regulations, just like the city of London, just like D.C., just like Rome, just like the Swiss government.
[00:20:27.978 --> 00:20:40.641]  Just like other institutions that model themselves after this, they're the new nobility, we're the slaves, and they lecture the unwashed masses about how communism and socialism will free them when we know it creates a living nightmare.
[00:20:41.221 --> 00:20:48.523]  This is someone who looks at drowning third world countries and basically throws them bowling balls and tells them that they've been given life rafts.
[00:20:48.963 --> 00:20:56.725]  I'm going to throw it back to David Knight here at InfoWars syndicated radio transmission, and of course we also have a Sunday radio show four to six p.m.
[00:20:57.225 --> 00:21:00.210]  I'll be hosting live as well, but this is an unprecedented time to be alive.
[00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:01.772]  You have been warned.
[00:21:01.812 --> 00:21:03.574]  The Globals are making their moves on every front.
[00:21:03.815 --> 00:21:05.237]  Their operatives are activating.
[00:21:05.257 --> 00:21:07.300]  They're trying to start a race war everywhere.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.603]  They're engineering financial collapse.
[00:21:09.763 --> 00:21:10.544]  It's all rigged.
[00:21:11.005 --> 00:21:12.647]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[00:21:13.388 --> 00:21:15.809]  But for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[00:21:15.849 --> 00:21:16.669]  Newtonian physics.
[00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:18.589]  People are ready to wake up right now.
[00:21:18.909 --> 00:21:24.911]  So spread the word that the good news is this evil has never succeeded before and it will fall this time.
[00:21:25.551 --> 00:21:30.453]  And that this Pope, for all intents and purposes, fits the bill of the false prophet of revelations.
[00:21:30.833 --> 00:21:32.593]  Alex Jones for InfoWars.com.
[00:21:33.653 --> 00:21:37.134]  Again, that's the Vatican coup report that Alex Jones has.
[00:21:37.154 --> 00:21:38.555]  You can find that on InfoWars.com.
[00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:48.235]  To sum up what Alex said, the fact that you had, for the first time, the predecessor of this Pope, the previous Pope, for the first time resigned and left.
[00:21:48.275 --> 00:21:50.156]  You had a Jesuit come in.
[00:21:50.516 --> 00:21:53.338]  All of these things were very suspicious.
[00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:55.920]  And now we see the gloves coming off.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.842]  The push for world government.
[00:21:58.462 --> 00:22:04.183]  You can see the picture of the Cameron Sickle crucifix that the Pope was given by the President of Bolivia.
[00:22:04.383 --> 00:22:06.504]  You can see that on InfoWars.com.
[00:22:06.524 --> 00:22:11.264]  You can also see that, it's a picture up on the Drudge Report, top of the page.
[00:22:11.525 --> 00:22:13.485]  Absolutely amazing picture.
[00:22:13.505 --> 00:22:15.265]  This is the way RT reports it.
[00:22:15.645 --> 00:22:22.447]  They say, communist crucifix for Pope Francis who lashes out at capitalism on a Bolivian tour.
[00:22:22.987 --> 00:22:24.067]  Some of the things that the Pope said.
[00:22:24.787 --> 00:22:31.094]  Truly communitarian economy is what he wants to create based on a distribution of goods amongst us all.
[00:22:31.294 --> 00:22:33.976]  He said the system is now intolerable.
[00:22:34.437 --> 00:22:35.758]  Let's not be afraid to say it.
[00:22:36.139 --> 00:22:36.919]  We need change.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:37.840]  We want change.
[00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:47.570]  Do you see how totally absorbed this Pope is in terms of politics and especially Marxist politics and world government politics?
[00:22:48.331 --> 00:22:49.831]  That's what he is totally focused on.
[00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:56.373]  And again, going back to this encyclical, and it was a very heavy-handed way to put out his comments on the environment.
[00:22:56.413 --> 00:23:00.714]  It's not something that has typically been a concern of the Catholic Church.
[00:23:00.854 --> 00:23:06.115]  Their concerns have typically been marriage and family and stopping abortion.
[00:23:06.495 --> 00:23:10.316]  That has been, in terms of social aspects, that has been the center.
[00:23:10.336 --> 00:23:11.256]  What has he done about that?
[00:23:12.028 --> 00:23:14.009]  He has completely ignored abortion.
[00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:17.052]  He's completely ignored the redefinition of the family.
[00:23:17.092 --> 00:23:18.953]  Had nothing at all to say about it.
[00:23:19.393 --> 00:23:22.596]  Whatever you think about that issue, you must find it strange.
[00:23:23.256 --> 00:23:27.459]  This sea change and attitude from the Vatican, from the Pope.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.221]  And then look at who he is embracing at the same time.
[00:23:30.261 --> 00:23:31.022]  Again, a complete 180.
[00:23:31.802 --> 00:23:34.024]  He's embracing this guy, Peter Schellenhuber.
[00:23:34.144 --> 00:23:35.565]  I'm sorry, John Schellenhuber.
[00:23:36.766 --> 00:23:40.449]  And if you want to look at his breakdown, what this guy's worldview is,
[00:23:41.109 --> 00:23:47.476]  He wrote an article on his think tank, a blog post, expanding the democracy universe.
[00:23:47.516 --> 00:23:50.219]  He says, let us incite more democracy.
[00:23:50.259 --> 00:23:52.241]  They always talk about the common people, don't they?
[00:23:52.701 --> 00:23:54.063]  That is not what this is about.
[00:23:54.443 --> 00:23:55.745]  This is about world government.
[00:23:55.945 --> 00:23:57.526]  He says, let us incite more democracy.
[00:23:57.547 --> 00:23:59.308]  He says, individual lobbyism
[00:23:59.969 --> 00:24:04.734]  ...became increasingly successful in thwarting political action towards climate protection.
[00:24:05.034 --> 00:24:12.281]  You see, it's individual lobbyism if they're not winning, and so they need to come up with a collective way to shut all this down.
[00:24:12.301 --> 00:24:13.662]  Here's his collective solution.
[00:24:13.682 --> 00:24:15.724]  He wants an Earth Constitution.
[00:24:16.385 --> 00:24:18.447]  He wants a global council.
[00:24:18.887 --> 00:24:23.010]  He wants a planetary court to haul people before.
[00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.312]  And of course, we're going to get that planetary court.
[00:24:25.692 --> 00:24:27.394]  We're going to get that Earth Constitution.
[00:24:27.734 --> 00:24:31.617]  That's what these trade treaties are going to usher in from an economic standpoint.
[00:24:31.637 --> 00:24:45.208]  So they're coming at us from an economic, presenting themselves as free trade and yet creating a transnational governance council, as Senator Sessions has pointed out, that's going to have power over the countries that have created it.
[00:24:45.748 --> 00:24:50.711]  They're not going to be allowed to see these treaties until just before they have to vote on them.
[00:24:50.871 --> 00:24:52.372]  They're not going to be allowed to amend them.
[00:24:52.732 --> 00:24:58.996]  Once they are passed, this Transnational Governance Council will be able to modify that as they wish.
[00:24:59.897 --> 00:25:04.740]  And Senator Sessions is pointing out the fact that this is not just economic, this is political.
[00:25:07.233 --> 00:25:08.714]  Creations that they've already made.
[00:25:08.814 --> 00:25:12.835]  The North American Free Trade Agreement, which is creating a North American Union.
[00:25:13.075 --> 00:25:14.976]  The European Union, which has already been created.
[00:25:15.516 --> 00:25:24.459]  They move, as we can see in the European Union, as we can see in the crisis that's going on with Greece, they move from an economic union to a political union by creating crisis.
[00:25:24.519 --> 00:25:26.160]  That's what we see happening right now.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:35.443]  That was the formula that was presented by Alan Greenspan, by the head of the largest bond company, Pemco, said they need to surrender sovereignty
[00:25:36.539 --> 00:25:37.419]  In order to make this work.
[00:25:37.439 --> 00:25:39.320]  We're not going to be able to make the currency work.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:44.982]  We can't have that work unless we have political sovereignty surrendered to the center as well.
[00:25:45.062 --> 00:25:46.143]  That's the progression.
[00:25:46.463 --> 00:25:47.503]  That's the way they move this.
[00:25:48.083 --> 00:25:49.524]  Take a look at some of the aspects.
[00:25:49.544 --> 00:25:52.905]  We've mentioned this before in this environmental encyclical, of course, that's Schellenhuber.
[00:25:53.846 --> 00:25:57.127]  He is director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
[00:25:57.167 --> 00:25:57.867]  That's in Germany.
[00:25:59.828 --> 00:26:02.029]  Understand this is a religion.
[00:26:03.447 --> 00:26:04.348]  It truly is religion.
[00:26:04.368 --> 00:26:07.329]  They call people who don't buy into this deniers.
[00:26:07.609 --> 00:26:10.011]  They present it to you not as evidence.
[00:26:10.091 --> 00:26:12.612]  They present it to you as a complete system.
[00:26:12.872 --> 00:26:18.935]  They argue for it, in favor of it, in terms of this is people of authority.
[00:26:18.995 --> 00:26:21.257]  That's the same way they present things in religion.
[00:26:21.317 --> 00:26:22.818]  They say, we are the authorities.
[00:26:23.078 --> 00:26:23.938]  We're the Pope, whatever.
[00:26:24.378 --> 00:26:25.759]  We're going to present this to you.
[00:26:26.339 --> 00:26:28.200]  If you don't believe it, you're an infidel.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:28.941]  You're a denier.
[00:26:30.165 --> 00:26:37.588]  We even had the head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that's a UN organization, the IPCC, when he just resigned.
[00:26:37.708 --> 00:26:38.368]  Oh, and guess what?
[00:26:38.488 --> 00:26:41.349]  It was a sex scandal that he resigned from.
[00:26:41.369 --> 00:26:42.950]  This always comes back to that, doesn't it?
[00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:50.852]  Just as Alex pointed out, he believes that there was a massive blackmail of people within the Catholic Church to make this happen.
[00:26:50.892 --> 00:26:54.694]  We see that is the way they move this through, as he pointed out with Dennis Hastert.
[00:26:54.954 --> 00:26:57.455]  They find people who are compromised, put them in positions of power.
[00:26:58.135 --> 00:27:05.804]  Again, when the IPCC head left, he said, global warming is my religion, my dharma.
[00:27:06.943 --> 00:27:11.106]  This guy has now been appointed to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.
[00:27:11.146 --> 00:27:19.032]  That's the position that was held by Galileo when they first had the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.
[00:27:19.413 --> 00:27:33.664]  That Pope shut it down for a couple hundred years because he didn't like the science that they came up with, because he had a man-centered view of the universe, a world-centered, earth-centered, geocentric view of the universe.
[00:27:34.324 --> 00:27:38.287]  And what we're being presented with now is a man-centered view of climate change.
[00:27:38.367 --> 00:27:39.148]  Forget the sun.
[00:27:39.929 --> 00:27:52.079]  We know now that the planets go around the sun, but we have to ignore the fact that the sun is the major influencing factor on our climate because it doesn't fit their political agenda.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.022]  So he wants to talk about the scientist that is now
[00:27:57.728 --> 00:28:08.513]  The person who's been appointed to this Scientific Advisory Council for the Pope, the person who was presenting his views on the climate, he is pushing what he calls a democracy universe.
[00:28:08.553 --> 00:28:10.934]  And again, it is nothing but world government.
[00:28:11.134 --> 00:28:12.615]  But look at who else is involved in this.
[00:28:12.655 --> 00:28:13.895]  Of course, this is the Earth League.
[00:28:14.275 --> 00:28:16.736]  They're calling for, they said, science-based action.
[00:28:16.776 --> 00:28:19.898]  But right there at the center of it, we've got Prince Charles.
[00:28:20.798 --> 00:28:27.001]  I think it's interesting when we look at what Alex was just talking about in terms of how they compromise people with these sexual scandals.
[00:28:27.691 --> 00:28:30.413]  There is stuff that is still breaking in the UK.
[00:28:30.533 --> 00:28:38.617]  Remember it was just back in March that we had ex-cops saying that there were people in the royal family part of a pedophile ring.
[00:28:39.057 --> 00:28:43.700]  But the inquiry was closed to shield Buckingham Palace from the scandal.
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.441]  This was in the Daily Mail.
[00:28:45.521 --> 00:28:46.922]  It was in multiple papers.
[00:28:48.443 --> 00:28:52.305]  Mystery Royal was part of a suspected pedophile ring being investigated by Scotland Yard.
[00:28:52.905 --> 00:28:54.166]  Again, we've seen this over and over again.
[00:28:54.186 --> 00:28:55.567]  We saw it with the Jimmy Savile scandal.
[00:28:56.207 --> 00:29:07.919]  The fact that he was close friends with the Royal Family, but the fact that this guy who was, other than his connections to the Royal Family, he was just some comedian on British television.
[00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:14.666]  Yet, there were multiple investigations from Scotland Yard, people who knew that he was doing this for decades as a pedophile.
[00:29:15.006 --> 00:29:16.848]  Multiple investigations had been shut down.
[00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:21.993]  After he died, the BBC, some people in the BBC, started doing a documentary.
[00:29:22.213 --> 00:29:24.595]  The higher-ups in the BBC shut it down.
[00:29:25.215 --> 00:29:27.156]  You see, they compartmentalize people.
[00:29:27.797 --> 00:29:37.184]  And when that compartmentalization shuts down, we always hear people, well, you know, how could the government be involved in these false flag operations or these other things that, it just sounds like conspiracy theories.
[00:29:37.504 --> 00:29:38.765]  It's called compartmentalization.
[00:29:39.006 --> 00:29:44.170]  And when that compartmentalization bursts, they have people at the top to shut it down.
[00:29:45.111 --> 00:29:45.491]  Stay with us.
[00:29:45.511 --> 00:29:53.014]  When we come back, we're going to talk about how self-driving robo-cabs are being pushed as a solution to global warming.
[00:29:53.234 --> 00:29:58.117]  But it's another trend to push for corporate governance and fascism.
[00:29:58.137 --> 00:29:58.437]  Stay with us.
[00:29:58.457 --> 00:29:59.157]  We're going to be right back.
[00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:00.217]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.698 --> 00:30:02.298]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.219 --> 00:30:05.900]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:32:19.726 --> 00:32:22.147]  And that's what you'll find at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:22.347 --> 00:32:29.951]  We have rejected, literally, hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:32:30.111 --> 00:32:32.453]  Or because they're not 100% organic?
[00:32:32.593 --> 00:32:39.058]  Or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com?
[00:32:39.198 --> 00:32:50.107]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine, or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shields, oxy powder, I believe,
[00:32:50.267 --> 00:32:50.807]  We're good.
[00:33:23.237 --> 00:33:29.573]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.181 --> 00:33:37.382]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:37.422 --> 00:33:40.245]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Wednesday, July 10th, 2015.
[00:33:40.366 --> 00:33:47.173]  In this last half hour, we heard a special report from Alex, the Vatican coup, as he pointed out.
[00:33:47.853 --> 00:33:57.424]  In every single instance, every problem that is being brought up, and of course most of the problems that are pushing for world government, are centered around climate change.
[00:33:58.137 --> 00:34:06.086]  But whether it's climate change protection or whether it's free trade, it always seems to be resulting in global governance.
[00:34:06.106 --> 00:34:14.475]  And we're going to continue to break this down for you because there have been some amazing overreaches this week in terms of trying to justify
[00:34:15.416 --> 00:34:29.026]  Global governance and corporate fascism, this kind of alliance between multinational corporations seeking monopoly over the worldwide production of their goods, using governments in every country to do that.
[00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:35.812]  We're going to take a close look at what's being done with Uber, with the Uber taxis in relation to that in just a moment.
[00:34:36.212 --> 00:34:41.876]  Before we do, I want to let you know this hour of the Alex Jones Show is brought to you by the products that we sell at Infowars.com.
[00:34:44.298 --> 00:34:44.558]  I don't know.
[00:35:04.347 --> 00:35:12.309]  Reviews that I want to read to you from some of the people that are there because it's really good to go there and that's what I always do when I go to look at a product.
[00:35:12.369 --> 00:35:21.272]  I like to, even if I don't buy from Amazon, I try not to buy from Amazon, but I will look at their product reviews because I want to know what people have said about it.
[00:35:21.832 --> 00:35:24.876]  This is what some of the people are saying about Survival Shield X2.
[00:35:25.597 --> 00:35:27.940]  This is Aussie man from South Australia.
[00:35:28.341 --> 00:35:30.464]  He says, I thought I would try this product, see if it made a difference.
[00:35:30.905 --> 00:35:32.006]  Wow, it did, he said.
[00:35:32.046 --> 00:35:36.853]  Within a week of using this, I have a clearer mind, I feel energized, even when I'm tired at the end of the day.
[00:35:36.873 --> 00:35:37.834]  I know
[00:35:38.675 --> 00:35:40.497]  I don't know if that makes sense, he says, but it's true.
[00:35:40.557 --> 00:35:41.678]  Thanks, Alex and the team.
[00:35:41.718 --> 00:35:44.941]  Another one from Gamer in Alberta, Canada.
[00:35:45.482 --> 00:35:46.843]  Says, best product I've ever used.
[00:35:46.963 --> 00:35:49.526]  I will never change to any other nascent iodine.
[00:35:49.706 --> 00:35:51.748]  This is a high quality product.
[00:35:51.788 --> 00:35:53.870]  And that's what people are saying on the site.
[00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.832]  As I pointed out, we've got over 400 reviews.
[00:35:56.413 --> 00:35:58.415]  Most of them are like that.
[00:35:58.635 --> 00:35:59.415]  Get your bottle of X2.
[00:35:59.616 --> 00:36:00.836]  We've got it in stock right now.
[00:36:00.936 --> 00:36:03.157]  We, as you know, we sell out of things pretty quickly.
[00:36:03.177 --> 00:36:05.298]  We've got a lot of products that are sold out right now.
[00:36:05.338 --> 00:36:08.940]  We were sold out of Survival Shield, Nascent Iodine for quite a while.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:09.920]  We now have it in stock.
[00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:11.441]  Now's the time for you to stock up.
[00:36:11.481 --> 00:36:14.042]  You can get it at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:14.062 --> 00:36:16.664]  Again, that's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:17.764 --> 00:36:22.507]  Now what we were talking about just before we had to give the break was these pedophile rings.
[00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:22.967]  And of course,
[00:36:24.036 --> 00:36:34.705]  There's connections between the Prince Charles and the Pope who are all pushing global governance, this Earth Constitution, the Earth League that Prince Charles is a center at.
[00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:45.915]  But you always notice that all these people who are pushing this, as well as the people who are typically in power, typically are involved in sex scandals, typically pedophile sex scandals.
[00:36:46.296 --> 00:36:50.359]  It's a very disturbing story that has just surfaced this
[00:36:51.604 --> 00:37:01.431]  Last couple of days from Staffordshire Police, they're looking at claims that police officers stood by while a girl six years old was raped.
[00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:04.913]  Now this girl is now grown up.
[00:37:04.953 --> 00:37:06.995]  This happened several decades ago.
[00:37:07.055 --> 00:37:08.396]  Her name is Esther Baker.
[00:37:09.196 --> 00:37:17.780]  She waived her right to anonymity and she claimed that uniformed police officers would stand guard and on occasion even take part in the abuse.
[00:37:18.621 --> 00:37:21.562]  She says, one of them, the police officers, I knew from church.
[00:37:22.343 --> 00:37:30.307]  There were a few occasions where they would be in uniform and I kind of knew, I learned that when they were in uniform, it was going to be a rough night.
[00:37:31.209 --> 00:37:35.612]  Now, this is an investigation that's going on that's very broad.
[00:37:35.652 --> 00:37:41.617]  She says she's concerned that people are going to be killed as a result of this investigation.
[00:37:41.657 --> 00:37:46.481]  So she's very concerned about that because this does happen when they start to expose these pedophile rings.
[00:37:46.521 --> 00:37:52.945]  And of course, back in March, we learned from many sources that were reporting on it at the time in the UK.
[00:37:53.866 --> 00:37:55.867]  About a royal connection.
[00:37:56.207 --> 00:37:59.829]  A connection in Buckingham Palace to a pedophile ring.
[00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:09.275]  And they pointed out that Scotland Yard has been accused of engineering 14 cover-ups of VIP child sex abuse.
[00:38:09.675 --> 00:38:13.157]  They say a member of the royal family was involved in the suspected pedophile ring.
[00:38:14.037 --> 00:38:15.558]  That's the claim of an ex-policeman.
[00:38:15.598 --> 00:38:20.101]  The officer said he was told by fellow officers that both a royal and a member of parliament
[00:38:20.641 --> 00:38:26.663]  Had both been identified as part of a major child abuse inquiry in the 1980s.
[00:38:28.464 --> 00:38:33.666]  As Alex pointed out, that's the way they get the goods on people.
[00:38:35.042 --> 00:38:37.424]  We don't know what they're doing to people in power.
[00:38:37.784 --> 00:38:41.888]  Many times they will find dirt on people after they're in power, use that to blackmail them.
[00:38:42.448 --> 00:38:45.610]  We're very concerned that situations like that have happened in the Supreme Court.
[00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:49.213]  You have to ask yourself, if they have that power, of course they would use it.
[00:38:49.253 --> 00:38:54.737]  That's the kind of people we have in control now, and you're kidding yourself if you don't realize that.
[00:38:55.278 --> 00:39:00.502]  That is one of the many dangers of a government that knows everything about everybody.
[00:39:00.802 --> 00:39:05.325]  But it doesn't usually work out that it's not just that they're looking for people who are blackmailable.
[00:39:05.425 --> 00:39:14.752]  They will often go out and find somebody like Dennis Hastert, some guy who is at one point he is just a wrestling coach and then all of a sudden he skyrockets to the top of the Republican Party.
[00:39:14.792 --> 00:39:15.073]  Why?
[00:39:15.753 --> 00:39:18.795]  Because he had been compromised and they knew it.
[00:39:19.356 --> 00:39:21.978]  They knew they could control this guy.
[00:39:23.211 --> 00:39:38.900]  Every time we look at this, just as I pointed out earlier, when the Pope is making justification for a global governance, what he says is that we need to have this because the multinational corporations have grown too large for the individual countries to control them.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.543]  Therefore, we need a world government to control the multinational corporations.
[00:39:43.243 --> 00:39:44.184]  It's not working that way.
[00:39:44.764 --> 00:40:04.062]  It's actually the multinational corporations who are creating the world government and using the Pope, using the politicians who are in power, using Prince Charles, using the idea of global warming, using all of these things, the promise of free trade, using all of these things to usher in world government.
[00:40:04.643 --> 00:40:05.744]  Here's a good example of this.
[00:40:05.844 --> 00:40:06.564]  Earlier this week,
[00:40:07.225 --> 00:40:10.768]  We had a study that was posted by an organization.
[00:40:11.448 --> 00:40:13.670]  I've got it right here.
[00:40:15.651 --> 00:40:18.173]  It was highlighted in National Geographic.
[00:40:18.373 --> 00:40:23.837]  It was highlighted by NBC, by the Washington Post, by the Guardian, by the Daily Mail.
[00:40:23.877 --> 00:40:24.297]  Here it is.
[00:40:24.357 --> 00:40:26.899]  It's from Nature and Climate Change.
[00:40:27.039 --> 00:40:32.823]  It was a study that was done by Lawrence Berkeley National Labs in Berkeley, California.
[00:40:33.803 --> 00:40:40.606]  Now, in this study, what they were telling everybody was that the way that we're going to curb global warming, this is the headlines from National Geographic.
[00:40:40.987 --> 00:40:44.548]  Self-driving robo-cabs could curb global warming.
[00:40:44.869 --> 00:40:46.089]  Here's the headline from NBC.
[00:40:46.449 --> 00:40:50.191]  Robotic cabs could help to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
[00:40:50.551 --> 00:40:51.792]  Another one from the Washington Post.
[00:40:52.172 --> 00:40:56.014]  A fleet of robo-cabs could dramatically slash vehicle emissions, suggests the study.
[00:40:56.054 --> 00:40:56.594]  And the Guardian.
[00:40:57.055 --> 00:40:59.156]  Electric robo-cabs would reduce U.S.
[00:40:59.176 --> 00:41:00.236]  greenhouse emissions by 94%.
[00:41:02.415 --> 00:41:02.695]  Why not 94.5%?
[00:41:02.996 --> 00:41:06.782]  Yeah, they've got it right down to that.
[00:41:07.363 --> 00:41:09.386]  Let's look at what they're really telling us here.
[00:41:09.406 --> 00:41:11.610]  This is absolutely amazing.
[00:41:12.431 --> 00:41:15.656]  Basically, their predictions are based on the idea.
[00:41:16.758 --> 00:41:22.043]  That they can decrease vehicle emissions by making the cabs smaller.
[00:41:22.343 --> 00:41:26.707]  Because they want to make sure that they can only fit one person and you can't carry anything.
[00:41:26.727 --> 00:41:29.569]  You know, forget the pickup truck where you're going to throw your equipment in the back.
[00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:34.294]  They freak out when they see somebody driving an SUV.
[00:41:34.314 --> 00:41:37.356]  When the mom's dropped the kids off and she's on her way back home.
[00:41:37.517 --> 00:41:37.857]  Look at that!
[00:41:37.937 --> 00:41:40.099]  An entire SUV with only one person in it.
[00:41:41.118 --> 00:41:42.039]  Okay, that's horrible.
[00:41:42.459 --> 00:41:47.122]  Or, you've got a pickup truck where the guy's working and he's got his tools or his equipment in the back.
[00:41:47.142 --> 00:41:49.824]  You know, hey, there's only one person in that pickup truck.
[00:41:49.844 --> 00:41:51.205]  We've got to do something about that.
[00:41:51.766 --> 00:41:58.210]  And so, you know, the way they're going to attack this, they say, is to make the cars so tiny.
[00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:00.052]  They're going to be so fuel efficient.
[00:42:00.848 --> 00:42:07.435]  They said the vast majority of car accidents, because it's also a safety issue, they said the vast majority of car accidents are the result of human error.
[00:42:07.956 --> 00:42:19.008]  We can take that out of the equation and make the streets a lot safer too, because the problem is, is that you're simply going to be replacing human drivers who are on the spot and can react if they're paying attention.
[00:42:20.043 --> 00:42:26.566]  You're going to replace them with programmers who are trying in advance to anticipate every possible scenario.
[00:42:27.166 --> 00:42:41.312]  And of course they're also going to be triaging, making a decision as to whether they should drive the car off the side of the road and kill you instead of killing the five people in the oncoming car.
[00:42:41.612 --> 00:42:43.213]  Because they will be talking to each other.
[00:42:43.373 --> 00:42:47.055]  Vehicle-to-vehicle communication is coming in just a couple of years, being mandated
[00:42:47.576 --> 00:42:54.736]  By the Department of Transportation, just this year, at the South by Southwest Festival they have here.
[00:42:55.575 --> 00:42:56.456]  They had people from the U.S.
[00:42:56.476 --> 00:43:03.522]  Department of Transportation and, of course, their presentation was about talking cars, because that sounds just so cool to talk about talking cars.
[00:43:03.582 --> 00:43:05.884]  But what they're going to be talking about is you.
[00:43:06.185 --> 00:43:08.807]  And who they're going to be talking to is the government.
[00:43:08.887 --> 00:43:13.071]  They're going to be monitoring and watching everything you do.
[00:43:13.491 --> 00:43:15.193]  Now, here's what they say in the study.
[00:43:15.233 --> 00:43:18.435]  They say autonomous taxis are anticipated
[00:43:19.536 --> 00:43:22.358]  To be deployed according to each trip's occupancy need.
[00:43:22.638 --> 00:43:23.719]  We're going to right-size it.
[00:43:24.259 --> 00:43:25.420]  So that's one of their assumptions.
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:30.043]  That we're going to, nobody needs to carry anything and everybody's going to be driving individually.
[00:43:30.063 --> 00:43:38.209]  And of course, with everybody in the family taking a taxi, an Uber taxi, nobody's going to win from that except for the owner of Uber.
[00:43:38.729 --> 00:43:40.630]  And it's not even efficient for the environment.
[00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:45.714]  Look, the passenger miles per gallon in an SUV is not bad when it's filled up.
[00:43:46.835 --> 00:43:47.636]  They understand that.
[00:43:47.676 --> 00:43:49.900]  That's why they sell us the whole concept of buses.
[00:43:51.262 --> 00:43:59.094]  Except that the buses in the cities, except for a few inner cities, buses drive around, as you well know, you've seen them driving around empty.
[00:44:00.543 --> 00:44:01.304]  That's the problem.
[00:44:01.324 --> 00:44:03.525]  You buy these expensive buses and they drive around empty.
[00:44:03.545 --> 00:44:10.771]  So now what they're going to do, though, they're going to have these Uber taxis that are going to be powered, they say, from an increasingly renewable energy source.
[00:44:11.431 --> 00:44:12.472]  Also, it's going to be clean.
[00:44:13.112 --> 00:44:15.234]  It's going to run from electricity.
[00:44:15.254 --> 00:44:25.642]  It reminds me of a friend of mine who worked on energy issues and he would go to whenever he'd have a presentation and he'd tell people that he was in favor of all the above.
[00:44:26.994 --> 00:44:28.835]  And a lot of people say, well, I just don't like coal.
[00:44:28.935 --> 00:44:29.995]  Coal is just too dirty.
[00:44:30.075 --> 00:44:31.976]  And he goes, well, what's your favorite source of energy?
[00:44:32.016 --> 00:44:33.616]  Well, I like electricity because it's clean.
[00:44:34.196 --> 00:44:41.298]  They have no idea that electricity is not a source of power because they don't think beyond the plug and the wall.
[00:44:41.518 --> 00:44:42.839]  They don't understand where this is coming from.
[00:44:42.859 --> 00:44:53.622]  And so most of these analyses are based on the idea that we're going to have something that is very fuel efficient because it's going to be electric and it's going to be small.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.101]  They say the upshot is radical.
[00:44:57.141 --> 00:45:00.703]  They say between 9 out of 10 current cars could be removed from the road.
[00:45:00.743 --> 00:45:09.347]  The research found if these automated vehicles were combined with high-capacity public transit because they want to make you dependent on them for movement.
[00:45:10.282 --> 00:45:13.865]  You want to know how they're going to enforce Agenda 21?
[00:45:13.945 --> 00:45:20.971]  How are they going to keep people confined in high density into the cities and not get out into the surrounding areas?
[00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:24.074]  Well, the way they're going to do that is by controlling your transportation.
[00:45:24.374 --> 00:45:25.755]  It's going to take three steps.
[00:45:26.616 --> 00:45:30.400]  Number one, they're going to make it far more expensive for you to drive your car.
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:31.541]  They're going to raise insurance rates.
[00:45:31.561 --> 00:45:32.862]  They're going to tax you by the mile.
[00:45:33.623 --> 00:45:37.687]  They're going to require that you buy things like vehicle-to-vehicle communication.
[00:45:37.707 --> 00:45:40.089]  They're not going to be content to let you drive the car.
[00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:42.131]  Secondly, they're going to offer you a carrot.
[00:45:42.432 --> 00:45:43.052]  That's the stick.
[00:45:43.432 --> 00:45:45.334]  Then they're going to offer you the carrot.
[00:45:46.226 --> 00:45:50.950]  The carrot is going to be, look, we have these self-driving cars from Uber.
[00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:56.794]  And of course, we've seen the Uber executive, Travis, I forget what his last name is, Kalochnik or something.
[00:45:57.254 --> 00:46:02.899]  Anyway, the guy who owns Uber has said, what makes our cars expensive is that other dude in the car.
[00:46:03.599 --> 00:46:06.782]  And once he goes away, our cars get really cheap.
[00:46:07.382 --> 00:46:09.284]  And then private ownership goes away.
[00:46:10.174 --> 00:46:10.814]  Except for him.
[00:46:11.555 --> 00:46:13.096]  He'll own all the cars.
[00:46:13.316 --> 00:46:17.058]  And he'll work with the government to control your transportation.
[00:46:17.339 --> 00:46:19.200]  To keep you confined into the inner city.
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.381]  Because what are you going to do for work?
[00:46:22.882 --> 00:46:24.463]  AI is going to be taking most of the jobs.
[00:46:24.483 --> 00:46:26.765]  You're going to be confined in the city.
[00:46:26.805 --> 00:46:30.067]  You're not going to have much money to even take an Uber taxi.
[00:46:31.257 --> 00:46:33.619]  That's how they're going to control transportation.
[00:46:34.339 --> 00:46:51.072]  At the same time they were doing all of this, there was an article on the Daily Mail which was really interesting because they were saying that electric cars were actually damaging your region and at the same time they had an insert saying, but electric self-driving cars are going to save energy and are going to be clean.
[00:46:51.952 --> 00:46:56.836]  And the premise on all of this was that in certain areas where they're generating the electricity, in certain areas
[00:46:58.018 --> 00:47:01.021]  They're generating it based on old coal plants.
[00:47:02.042 --> 00:47:02.562]  Well, fine.
[00:47:02.683 --> 00:47:04.664]  Old coal plants do create pollution.
[00:47:04.905 --> 00:47:07.047]  However, the new ones don't.
[00:47:07.527 --> 00:47:14.034]  It's not a problem with coal any more than you're going to say that everything is clean because of electricity.
[00:47:14.054 --> 00:47:15.815]  It depends on how that electricity is generated.
[00:47:16.576 --> 00:47:17.157]  And it's not
[00:47:18.131 --> 00:47:25.738]  It doesn't make any sense to demonize coal per se, just because you've got old, inefficient, dirty factories.
[00:47:26.038 --> 00:47:36.528]  You could replace those factories rather than giving a $7,500 per car subsidy from the federal government for electric cars, or heavily subsidizing some of the other forms of energy.
[00:47:37.429 --> 00:47:44.216]  But finally, one of the things that they're saying is it's going to save so much energy because these things are going to be small and self-defined and lightweight.
[00:47:44.336 --> 00:47:51.544]  And yet, look at this study where they're looking at UNC, University of North Carolina, is exploring automated cars.
[00:47:52.084 --> 00:47:59.472]  They say people are going to look back in a very short time and they're going to say, why did all these people ever even want to drive these cars themselves?
[00:48:00.313 --> 00:48:07.923]  Well, they've been given grants of 1.3 million dollars from GM and the National Science Foundation, and what they're concerned about is the computing power.
[00:48:08.744 --> 00:48:13.891]  They say it sucks up a lot of size, a lot of weight, a lot of power.
[00:48:15.072 --> 00:48:18.397]  See, those are things that affect your efficiency.
[00:48:19.443 --> 00:48:28.587]  It also affects your privacy, though, and that's my big concern with this, because, as I said, it's always, the model has always been making people dependent on government.
[00:48:28.627 --> 00:48:30.347]  That's been the basis of the welfare state.
[00:48:30.427 --> 00:48:32.348]  That's been the basis of public transportation.
[00:48:32.388 --> 00:48:36.050]  They want you to be dependent on them, to ride their buses, to ride their subway.
[00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:42.952]  People choose to do that, that's fine, except they don't want you to be able to drive your car, because that gives you freedom and independence.
[00:48:42.972 --> 00:48:44.313]  They don't want you to live in the suburbs.
[00:48:44.813 --> 00:48:46.414]  Because that gives you freedom and independence.
[00:48:46.454 --> 00:48:53.998]  I remember a city council meeting back in Raleigh about 35 years ago I went to, and there was a lady there who had a city council person.
[00:48:54.398 --> 00:49:02.122]  She had just gone to Russia, and she was just gushing about the Russian subways, how she could ride all over Moscow for just a nickel.
[00:49:02.162 --> 00:49:02.882]  She could go anywhere.
[00:49:03.362 --> 00:49:04.423]  Why can't we have that here?
[00:49:04.483 --> 00:49:06.584]  She said, we need to buy light rail.
[00:49:07.024 --> 00:49:08.365]  The taxpayers need to pay for that.
[00:49:09.105 --> 00:49:13.009]  It's like, you have no idea what the true cost of that ride was.
[00:49:13.049 --> 00:49:17.312]  She's looking at the nickel, just like that person says, I want clean energy, I want electricity.
[00:49:17.693 --> 00:49:24.779]  Or they ignore the fact that coal is being generated for their comparison purposes out of factories that are many, many decades old.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:30.005]  She's not looking at the true cost of that, but the true cost, the true cost is your freedom.
[00:49:30.285 --> 00:49:33.910]  And that brings us to the third point of the Uber taxis.
[00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:40.017]  Again, there's the carrot of the Uber car that's going to be cheap, always there, you don't have to own your car.
[00:49:40.357 --> 00:49:45.243]  There's the stick of making it impossible to financially afford your own personal car.
[00:49:46.104 --> 00:49:50.187]  And then there's the stick they beat you with, which is monopoly pricing.
[00:49:50.347 --> 00:50:01.013]  Once they've driven you out of your car, once they have established the Uber model of the robo-taxi, then they're going to beat you with a stick of pricing.
[00:50:01.333 --> 00:50:02.834]  And you can already see this happening.
[00:50:02.874 --> 00:50:03.335]  Look at this.
[00:50:03.455 --> 00:50:05.296]  Just this week, they've got a strike.
[00:50:05.476 --> 00:50:06.817]  They've got a tube strike in London.
[00:50:06.917 --> 00:50:07.897]  Subway strike in London.
[00:50:08.718 --> 00:50:10.659]  And people are saying it's daylight robbery.
[00:50:10.699 --> 00:50:12.700]  They're jacking up prices on Uber 300%.
[00:50:15.745 --> 00:50:17.667]  That's what they're doing in wake of the strike.
[00:50:17.947 --> 00:50:20.530]  And we've seen this happening over and over again.
[00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:25.535]  New York Times talked about how on New Year's Eve, a guy said, well, I got a regular taxi drive.
[00:50:25.595 --> 00:50:27.477]  I took a two-mile trip on New Year's Eve.
[00:50:27.537 --> 00:50:29.719]  It cost me $13, including tip.
[00:50:30.059 --> 00:50:35.625]  And he says, three hours later, it was wee hours of the morning, I didn't want to try to catch a taxi for the reverse trip, so I called Uber.
[00:50:37.236 --> 00:50:40.477]  Said I paid $47 for that trip.
[00:50:41.218 --> 00:50:44.879]  Okay, so it's they're arbitrating the price based on that.
[00:50:44.899 --> 00:50:45.700]  It's surge pricing.
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:49.401]  Saw the same thing happen here in Austin around Formula One.
[00:50:49.761 --> 00:50:52.602]  Jacking up prices in many cases several hundred percent.
[00:50:52.642 --> 00:50:57.104]  We've had people get several hundred dollar rides from Uber.
[00:50:57.404 --> 00:50:58.505]  When you have a monopoly,
[00:50:59.085 --> 00:51:00.686]  You can charge anything you want.
[00:51:01.226 --> 00:51:10.869]  So the multinational corporations, and Uber is a great example of this, are working with Wall Street, they're working with the government, to create a monopoly so they can charge anything they want and control you.
[00:51:10.889 --> 00:51:13.790]  So I asked my buddy Mark, where does the name Ghost Gun come from?
[00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:16.691]  You know the ghost AR-15 80% rifle kits?
[00:51:16.771 --> 00:51:17.031]  Ghost?
[00:51:17.051 --> 00:51:17.792]  What's a ghost gun?
[00:51:17.812 --> 00:51:19.892]  He says, uh, duh, they kill ghosts.
[00:51:19.952 --> 00:51:20.513]  I said, really?
[00:51:20.653 --> 00:51:20.933]  Ghosts?
[00:51:20.953 --> 00:51:21.373]  He said, yeah.
[00:51:21.753 --> 00:51:28.979]  As a matter of fact, they're guaranteed to kill ghosts, Sasquatch, space aliens, and any other paranormal force that might come your way.
[00:51:29.319 --> 00:51:31.981]  So they just appropriately named them Ghost Guns.
[00:51:32.201 --> 00:51:35.223]  And I said, okay, that's a big problem in my neighborhood, so where do I get one?
[00:51:35.263 --> 00:51:36.384]  He said, Guns80.com.
[00:51:36.444 --> 00:51:36.904]  I said, where?
[00:51:37.145 --> 00:51:38.045]  Guns80.com?
[00:51:38.286 --> 00:51:39.446]  Okay then, I'm headed to Guns80.com.
[00:51:40.407 --> 00:51:49.114]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.

[00:52:10.353 --> 00:52:14.696]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[00:52:14.816 --> 00:52:19.540]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:23.543]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease.
[00:52:23.703 --> 00:52:27.146]  And a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[00:52:27.366 --> 00:52:29.927]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[00:52:30.028 --> 00:52:34.410]  I've taken whey protein products for years, and I've never noticed results I have with your product.
[00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:37.472]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life.
[00:52:37.692 --> 00:52:41.534]  Within a few days of taking One World Whey, I noticed a dramatic change.
[00:52:41.654 --> 00:52:45.737]  Also, in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[00:52:45.917 --> 00:52:49.399]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar, and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[00:52:49.519 --> 00:52:53.441]  But I've noticed in the past week or so, I'm not feeling bad anymore, and the foot pain is gone.
[00:52:53.621 --> 00:52:57.825]  I'm just finishing up a five-pound top I ordered and just got off the phone ordering more.
[00:52:57.985 --> 00:52:59.687]  I love your product.
[00:52:59.927 --> 00:53:01.569]  Thank you.

[00:54:11.468 --> 00:54:12.168]  We are armed!
[00:54:13.348 --> 00:54:18.831]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:18.971 --> 00:54:21.833]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:54:33.689 --> 00:54:36.572]  Joining us later in the show, we're going to be talking to John Rappaport.
[00:54:36.592 --> 00:54:39.836]  We're going to be talking about the developments in California.
[00:54:39.856 --> 00:54:42.119]  Of course, California is taking the lead in a lot of things.
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:46.363]  A lot of things that we're not too happy about.
[00:54:46.784 --> 00:54:51.469]  One of them, of course, is the loss of informed consent.
[00:54:52.592 --> 00:54:57.274]  One of the hallmarks of medical tyranny is to take away people's informed consent.
[00:54:57.734 --> 00:55:00.655]  That's how you get things, like the Tuskegee experiments.
[00:55:01.295 --> 00:55:13.659]  That's how you get things like we saw at UNC, where they were experimenting on people deliberately, trying to give them respiratory or heart issues, and they were successful in doing that, in order to push a regulatory agenda of the EPA.
[00:55:13.999 --> 00:55:15.120]  We tried to shut that down.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:30.847]  The judge said, no, we're not going to get a restraining order against that, and they continued to do these experiments, selecting out people who were suffering from respiratory or heart issues, exposing, directly hooking them up to a diesel tailpipe.
[00:55:31.767 --> 00:55:41.412]  See, when you don't inform people of what's going on, when you don't care what their consent is, when you say that the greater good is a bigger concern than the individual,
[00:55:42.307 --> 00:55:43.368]  That's what you wind up getting.
[00:55:43.668 --> 00:55:45.769]  That's the fundamental problem with communism.
[00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:54.816]  And as we've been talking about in this last hour, the fact that we now have a Pope who's been presented, rightfully so, with a hammer and sickle crucifix.
[00:55:56.397 --> 00:56:00.920]  That should be the symbol of this Pope, because that's precisely what he is pushing.
[00:56:01.499 --> 00:56:15.229]  When we look at global governance, when we look at the multinational corporations, just understand that it was the German central banker who sent Vladimir Lenin from Switzerland into Russia with 10 million dollars of gold in a sealed train.
[00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:17.030]  How's that?
[00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:18.171]  Does that make your head spin?
[00:56:18.952 --> 00:56:33.162]  The Germans, who are supposed to be the rivals of Russia politically in the two countries, as well as the rival systems of capitalism or fascism, if you wish, in Germany and communism in Russia.
[00:56:33.242 --> 00:56:39.007]  No, it was the German central banker who funded Lenin's revolution.
[00:56:39.027 --> 00:56:40.068]  And at the same time,
[00:56:40.828 --> 00:56:42.549]  His brother was in the U.S.
[00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:47.572]  working with JPMorgan to secretly establish the Federal Reserve as a private corporation.
[00:56:48.013 --> 00:56:51.275]  This is the global scheming that goes on with these people.
[00:56:51.335 --> 00:56:57.198]  This is what we're seeing now with the multiple pronged attack to create a world government.
[00:56:57.238 --> 00:56:59.580]  That's what we've been talking about this last hour.
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:02.882]  The push for establishing a global governance.
[00:57:03.482 --> 00:57:16.592]  Both by these corporately developed and secret treaties, the Trans-Atlantic, Trans-Pacific Partnership treaties, as well as these calls for global governance to stop global warming, or what they believe is global warming.
[00:57:16.612 --> 00:57:18.173]  Of course, we can't get that information from them.
[00:57:18.193 --> 00:57:19.334]  They don't want to show us their data.
[00:57:19.554 --> 00:57:21.216]  They only want to give us their conclusions.
[00:57:21.636 --> 00:57:22.617]  Their models don't work.
[00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:26.772]  They don't predict what... We've seen their models.
[00:57:27.353 --> 00:57:38.141]  It's absolutely absurd to think that when they can't predict the weather a couple of days in advance accurately, that they're going to predict the climate 50, 100 years in the future.
[00:57:38.741 --> 00:57:39.342]  Can't be done.
[00:57:39.362 --> 00:57:40.102]  They're not doing it.
[00:57:40.262 --> 00:57:44.125]  And the short-term predictions that their models have made have been absolute failures.
[00:57:44.165 --> 00:57:47.107]  We've seen rises in CO2.
[00:57:47.868 --> 00:57:50.050]  We've seen a rise in that, and we've not seen a rise in
[00:57:52.071 --> 00:57:52.871]  We're good to go.
[00:58:12.116 --> 00:58:12.857]  It's global warming.
[00:58:12.957 --> 00:58:20.844]  And the way they did this, they said that, look at this, we're seeing a hive collapses are predominantly in southern climates.
[00:58:21.424 --> 00:58:26.368]  Well, that may be because that's where most of the agriculture is being done.
[00:58:26.689 --> 00:58:35.016]  Previous studies back in 2014 laid the blame with pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids, I think is how they pronounce that.
[00:58:35.586 --> 00:58:37.267]  And the hive collapse was in the winter.
[00:58:37.327 --> 00:58:42.590]  Nevertheless, their conclusion is because of global warming, we need to force relocate the bees to the north.
[00:58:43.110 --> 00:58:45.212]  No, they struggle with the winter.
[00:58:45.252 --> 00:58:46.672]  That's when they're having their hive collapse.
[00:58:46.912 --> 00:58:47.793]  Absolute insanity.
[00:58:48.073 --> 00:58:48.533]  Stay with us.
[00:58:48.553 --> 00:58:49.194]  We'll be right back.

[01:00:16.246 --> 01:00:16.886]  Big Brother.
[01:00:17.567 --> 01:00:18.587]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:19.327 --> 01:00:20.428]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:21.088 --> 01:00:21.889]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.669 --> 01:00:23.549]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:27.911]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.412 --> 01:00:32.474]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.256 --> 01:00:38.576]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:38.596 --> 01:00:39.557]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:00:39.617 --> 01:00:48.218]  In the next segment, we're going to have a special report from Alex Jones about attempts in California to ban terms husband and wife.
[01:00:48.919 --> 01:00:52.159]  They're not content to take away our informed consent.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.660]  They're going to come after everything.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.020]  They're not going to leave you with any choice.
[01:00:57.261 --> 01:01:03.522]  When we look at the removal of informed consent, and we're going to talk at the bottom of the hour to John Rapoport about what's going on in California with that.
[01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:08.062]  We look at the people who are taking away your informed consent.
[01:01:08.082 --> 01:01:13.808]  These are the people who have always supported abortion in the name of being pro-choice.
[01:01:14.569 --> 01:01:17.712]  Yet they don't want you to choose how to take care of your children.
[01:01:18.092 --> 01:01:20.855]  They don't want you to make the decisions about your family.
[01:01:21.676 --> 01:01:24.359]  They don't think that you should have any privacy either.
[01:01:24.399 --> 01:01:27.303]  And it's not just the spying from the NSA.
[01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:29.426]  No, they want to know everything about you.
[01:01:29.486 --> 01:01:31.148]  They want to control everything about you.
[01:01:31.168 --> 01:01:33.511]  We've also got an article up on Infowars.com.
[01:01:33.831 --> 01:01:37.155]  School threatens to call DHS if parents show up late.
[01:01:37.175 --> 01:01:38.417]  You know, when I saw this headline...
[01:01:38.997 --> 01:01:41.018]  I thought that was Department of Homeland Security.
[01:01:41.038 --> 01:01:41.839]  You know, they're going to call them.
[01:01:41.879 --> 01:01:46.041]  No, it's actually Department of Health and Human, let's see, Department of Human Services.
[01:01:46.101 --> 01:01:48.543]  These are the people who will take away your kids.
[01:01:49.223 --> 01:01:53.666]  And they say, if you are late picking up your children, children must be picked up on time.
[01:01:53.686 --> 01:01:54.647]  This is the memo they sent out.
[01:01:54.687 --> 01:01:55.427]  We got a picture of it.
[01:01:55.547 --> 01:01:56.708]  Children must be picked up on time.
[01:01:56.768 --> 01:02:00.990]  If they're not picked up on time, we will call the Department of Human Services.
[01:02:01.371 --> 01:02:04.633]  You'll then, will have to pick them up at court.
[01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:07.875]  At court, the next day.
[01:02:07.955 --> 01:02:11.438]  They're going to keep them overnight, presumably put them in jail.
[01:02:11.679 --> 01:02:19.946]  They're going to keep them until the next day, and you're going to go to court and, you know, if you're late picking your kids up at school now, we just might take them away from you.
[01:02:20.106 --> 01:02:23.449]  Maybe turn them over to a pedophile ring for some of the VIPs.
[01:02:23.469 --> 01:02:24.370]  I don't know.
[01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:25.711]  But that's out of Oregon.
[01:02:26.211 --> 01:02:28.433]  And then in California, they are trying to
[01:02:29.594 --> 01:02:34.177]  Banned the terms husband and wife because they discriminate against gay people.
[01:02:34.237 --> 01:02:36.698]  And this is a broad-based movement.
[01:02:36.718 --> 01:02:39.700]  This is not just one wacko in California.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:44.983]  This is legislation that's been proposed by over two dozen Democrats in the state.
[01:02:46.204 --> 01:02:47.404]  See, that's the way you control people.
[01:02:47.444 --> 01:02:49.746]  You control people with the language.
[01:02:50.746 --> 01:02:53.608]  That's always the high ground in terms of political battles.
[01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:56.790]  They're coming after the family, folks.
[01:02:57.110 --> 01:02:58.511]  They've made no bones about it.
[01:02:58.551 --> 01:03:01.573]  We've had Melissa, Harris, Perry, is that her name, guys?
[01:03:01.613 --> 01:03:02.574]  Did I get that right?
[01:03:03.414 --> 01:03:08.558]  Telling us, you know, you've just got to get over this notion of private ownership of children.
[01:03:08.598 --> 01:03:09.678]  You know, you don't own the kids.
[01:03:10.099 --> 01:03:11.900]  It's the village that's going to raise the kids.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.682]  No, villages raise monsters.
[01:03:15.422 --> 01:03:24.589]  Villages raise people that see the village as their parents, have loyalty only to what the village tells them.
[01:03:24.609 --> 01:03:31.073]  That's why Plato, going all the way back to ancient Greece, in Plato's Republic, he wanted to take the children away from the family.
[01:03:31.133 --> 01:03:32.534]  He wanted to destroy the family.
[01:03:32.595 --> 01:03:37.798]  He had essentially kind of a brave new world approach, and that's what we're seeing coming out of California.
[01:03:37.818 --> 01:03:40.961]  He wanted people to get so caught up in their personal hedonism,
[01:03:42.424 --> 01:03:44.648]  That they didn't want to have a family, number one.
[01:03:44.688 --> 01:03:47.974]  And number two, the kids would not know who their parents were.
[01:03:49.016 --> 01:03:54.086]  The only loyalty, the only stability, the only foundation they would have would be the state.
[01:03:55.444 --> 01:03:59.286]  Every dictator throughout history says, give me your children at whatever the age is.
[01:03:59.326 --> 01:04:00.307]  They all have different ages.
[01:04:00.707 --> 01:04:02.789]  Give them to me though as early as possible.
[01:04:03.209 --> 01:04:05.570]  I'll keep them for a few years and they're mine for life.
[01:04:06.351 --> 01:04:07.351]  They all understand that.
[01:04:07.972 --> 01:04:10.373]  That's the way you control subsequent generations.
[01:04:10.453 --> 01:04:11.594]  It's through education.
[01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:14.256]  That's why it is absolutely imperative.
[01:04:14.716 --> 01:04:17.778]  Strike a blow for freedom, for civilization.
[01:04:17.958 --> 01:04:19.299]  Educate your own children.
[01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:22.991]  Make sure you take control of their education.
[01:04:23.031 --> 01:04:24.772]  If you've got to do it collectively with other people.
[01:04:24.812 --> 01:04:26.793]  I know that there's many single parents out there.
[01:04:26.813 --> 01:04:27.914]  I know that homes are broken.
[01:04:27.954 --> 01:04:30.555]  It's a very difficult thing to do even if you're married.
[01:04:30.896 --> 01:04:32.577]  It has to be a priority.
[01:04:33.157 --> 01:04:34.678]  But it will pay dividends.
[01:04:34.758 --> 01:04:35.999]  It will pay dividends in your life.
[01:04:36.459 --> 01:04:40.061]  And it is the only way we're going to save society.
[01:04:40.382 --> 01:04:44.364]  Is if you will take personal control of your children.
[01:04:44.744 --> 01:04:45.345]  Raise them.
[01:04:45.545 --> 01:04:46.065]  Love them.
[01:04:46.265 --> 01:04:46.786]  Teach them.
[01:04:47.566 --> 01:04:48.667]  What is important?
[01:04:48.887 --> 01:04:56.992]  Teach them the foundations and the fundamentals because if you don't, if you surrender them to strangers that you don't know, we will live in a brave new world.
[01:04:57.232 --> 01:04:57.653]  Stay with us.
[01:04:57.933 --> 01:05:04.237]  When we come back, Alex Jones is going to have a report on this banning of the term husband and wife in California.
[01:05:10.114 --> 01:05:12.836]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[01:05:13.197 --> 01:05:15.999]  Today is July 10th, 2015.
[01:05:17.401 --> 01:05:24.086]  Now we are five days away from Jade Helm commencing over a number of states.
[01:05:24.527 --> 01:05:32.354]  Just down the road in Bastrop, we're expecting troops to converge on this town, conducting exercises in people's property.
[01:05:32.574 --> 01:05:40.659]  And we now know that the military has released a statement saying that media will not be allowed to film these exercises.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:49.665]  But they keep telling us time and time again that InfoWars is just crazy, we're out of our mind to even think or question this exercise.
[01:05:49.886 --> 01:05:56.830]  But in previous exercises, media has been allowed to film these training events.
[01:05:57.090 --> 01:06:02.374]  I want to encourage each and every single one of you to grab a camera, get off your butt and go out and film these exercises.
[01:06:02.594 --> 01:06:04.535]  They can't keep this from us.
[01:06:04.815 --> 01:06:05.996]  We know what's going on.
[01:06:06.196 --> 01:06:07.416]  We're going to expose it.
[01:06:07.516 --> 01:06:09.197]  We're going to bring it down.
[01:06:10.058 --> 01:06:12.499]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:12.699 --> 01:06:13.719]  Check it out today.
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:19.822]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore cutting edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none.
[01:06:19.942 --> 01:06:22.364]  And that's what you'll find at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:22.564 --> 01:06:29.607]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest
[01:06:29.667 --> 01:06:30.347]  We're good to go.
[01:06:50.495 --> 01:06:51.016]  We're good.
[01:07:10.211 --> 01:07:15.993]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[01:07:16.333 --> 01:07:20.634]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[01:07:20.914 --> 01:07:28.617]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[01:07:28.877 --> 01:07:34.079]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:39.962]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[01:07:40.342 --> 01:07:45.224]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[01:07:45.284 --> 01:07:48.886]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:07:49.226 --> 01:07:55.429]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:07:55.849 --> 01:08:00.833]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[01:08:00.993 --> 01:08:04.476]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:04.716 --> 01:08:08.298]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:08:08.939 --> 01:08:16.645]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:17.025 --> 01:08:19.287]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:23.288 --> 01:08:34.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, we face a globalist program, a plan, to end the human species as we know it and make us asexual, or basically non-sexual.
[01:08:35.566 --> 01:08:39.731]  This was written about in 1932 by Aldous Huxley in Brave New World.
[01:08:40.452 --> 01:08:49.142]  He then wrote the book in 1961, Brave New World, revisited and gave a speech before his death in 1962 that is online.
[01:08:49.442 --> 01:08:55.028]  It's one hour long at Berkeley, admitting the entire plan to brainwash everyone, break up families.
[01:08:55.809 --> 01:09:06.056]  Uh, ban single family dwellings, uh, and basically put chemicals in the food and water to turn us into asexual jellyfish to then be phased out for population reduction.
[01:09:06.416 --> 01:09:13.460]  His brother ran the UN UNESCO program and is the founder of the World Transhumanist Society and a eugenicist.
[01:09:13.921 --> 01:09:16.102]  He was the head of the Eugenics Society when he changed the name.
[01:09:17.683 --> 01:09:18.923]  That's the context here.
[01:09:19.464 --> 01:09:22.565]  And the Russians understand that and talk about it on state-run TV.
[01:09:22.985 --> 01:09:33.768]  Again, I'm not saying they're angels, but they don't want to commit suicide, because they were already under a eugenics program, and their population went down by more than 35% under the Soviet hell.
[01:09:34.548 --> 01:09:36.189]  But that was Janitor Shultz and Eastern Exposed.
[01:09:36.929 --> 01:09:44.051]  Now, in California, and in other major states, and in cities across the country, like Portland and Seattle,
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:53.705]  They're announcing bans on building new single-family dwellings, saying that's racist and hateful that there will be places for a family.
[01:09:54.686 --> 01:09:56.787]  This isn't being tolerant.
[01:09:56.807 --> 01:10:06.653]  This is you existing as bad, like the name boys and girls being phased out because it's hateful and not allowed to be used in these major cities and states we just listed.
[01:10:07.034 --> 01:10:12.377]  California has now introduced the bill to ban keywords
[01:10:13.169 --> 01:10:14.912]  Like husband and wife.
[01:10:15.773 --> 01:10:18.337]  And they're also moving to restrict boy and girl.
[01:10:18.658 --> 01:10:20.540]  Because it's hurtful if you're a boy or a girl.
[01:10:20.841 --> 01:10:24.486]  Someone else might identify as a piece of furniture.
[01:10:24.907 --> 01:10:25.808]  Or trans-abled.
[01:10:26.932 --> 01:10:35.101]  This is a psychological warfare program to go out and empower groups of people so their whole identity is this new thing they are.
[01:10:35.441 --> 01:10:38.985]  Not the Bill of Rights, not the Constitution, not family, not private property.
[01:10:39.286 --> 01:10:46.333]  And then once they have this broken strategy that Clinton insider Larry Nichols has talked about, once they have everybody balkanized, they can take over.
[01:10:47.034 --> 01:10:54.578]  Let's go look at some of these articles that are on Infowars.com right now, and then David Knight and others like John Rappaport are going to break it down.
[01:10:54.898 --> 01:10:56.419]  This has nothing to do with liberal or conservative.
[01:10:56.819 --> 01:11:15.790]  This is a scientific takeover, and that's why they push it everywhere and are pushing it on children to confuse them, to disable them, to where they are basically mentally ill basket cases who see racism and sexism everywhere, to where Jerry Seinfeld says, hey, we're going to move back to New York some so you can meet boys.
[01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:21.834]  You know, we're out here in the country, you're bored, and she says just to say the word boys is sexist.
[01:11:23.055 --> 01:11:24.936]  See, that existing is sexist.
[01:11:25.416 --> 01:11:34.423]  And the Russians, I have a clip off Russian TV, well it's the big Canadian paper reporting on it, with the head minister for family affairs saying our species is under attack.
[01:11:34.803 --> 01:11:35.804]  That's what this is.
[01:11:36.424 --> 01:11:38.325]  Let's go see the articles in the video.
[01:11:40.487 --> 01:11:45.711]  Now, California itself already banned the term husband and wife.
[01:11:46.644 --> 01:11:50.147]  In England, I interviewed Robin Page of the BBC who gave a speech saying
[01:12:02.418 --> 01:12:11.281]  Rural communities have served the same rights as homosexuals and Muslims, and he was arrested saying the word homosexual is hateful, even though it's a scientific term.
[01:12:11.621 --> 01:12:13.221]  So this is an inversion of reality.
[01:12:13.241 --> 01:12:18.863]  So California has already banned the word husband and wife, and now they've got a bill to completely ban it.
[01:12:19.603 --> 01:12:20.183]  Here's the article.
[01:12:20.243 --> 01:12:24.404]  Democrats introduced a bill to ban husband and wife as anti-gay words.
[01:12:24.444 --> 01:12:27.205]  This is how you take over society through political correctness.
[01:12:27.665 --> 01:12:29.626]  This is the same thing that was done in Russia.
[01:12:31.004 --> 01:12:37.248]  The words husband and wife were already deleted from California state law last year in order to accommodate and not hurt anyone's feelings.
[01:12:37.268 --> 01:12:49.494]  See, the existence of husband and wife hurts people just like the existence of the word boy and girl is being banned in school and people are now called purple penguins because the existence of boys and girls is hurtful and bad.
[01:12:49.875 --> 01:12:52.116]  This is not out of control crazy liberals.
[01:12:52.536 --> 01:12:56.138]  This is psychological warfare, setting the precedent to ban words.
[01:12:57.739 --> 01:12:59.843]  The Russian population has plunged.
[01:12:59.863 --> 01:13:02.648]  Of course, the entire West is having about 1.3 children.
[01:13:03.088 --> 01:13:06.274]  And so they've got an initiative to tax incentives for folks to get married and have kids.
[01:13:06.695 --> 01:13:07.736]  So they'll be humans.
[01:13:09.116 --> 01:13:13.878]  Well, now they've created a flag that's the family flag.
[01:13:13.898 --> 01:13:15.118]  Doesn't attack anybody or anything.
[01:13:15.378 --> 01:13:17.899]  And folks, of course, want it banned and want it restricted.
[01:13:18.139 --> 01:13:20.500]  So this is totalitarianism here in the United States.
[01:13:20.881 --> 01:13:27.843]  Ban people criticizing gay marriage, get rid of their free speech, put gag orders in on the couple that wouldn't back the cake, where they can't talk to the media.
[01:13:27.863 --> 01:13:29.684]  I mean, how does that hold up in court?
[01:13:29.884 --> 01:13:30.864]  First Amendment violation.
[01:13:31.264 --> 01:13:32.365]  And now, in Russia,
[01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:36.991]  Their minister that is over all this says it like it is right here.
[01:13:37.311 --> 01:13:38.911]  Here is the piece from the Globe and Mail.
[01:13:39.972 --> 01:13:44.753]  This flag, he says, is a way for Russia to display its values to the rest of the world.
[01:13:46.073 --> 01:13:47.333]  These are our values.
[01:13:47.814 --> 01:13:53.155]  This is how we are, and this is how we live, and this is how we will live to continue as human species.
[01:13:56.053 --> 01:13:57.714]  Oh my gosh, it's so terrible.
[01:13:57.754 --> 01:14:00.116]  And then they go on to the piece to say, isn't it horrible?
[01:14:00.837 --> 01:14:02.478]  Why a flag for families?
[01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:04.259]  And then you can look it up.
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:06.481]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:14:07.001 --> 01:14:11.645]  They have now, again, in Seattle and a bunch of other cities, Austin's set to push it as well.
[01:14:13.131 --> 01:14:17.477]  They are now coming out saying they're going to ban single-family dwellings.
[01:14:17.497 --> 01:14:26.709]  And then when you need a repair of an existing single-family dwelling, old-fashioned house, they're going to come in and make you divide it, move people into it to accommodate immigrant populations.
[01:14:26.749 --> 01:14:28.211]  You cannot make
[01:14:28.832 --> 01:14:29.353]  this up.
[01:14:29.873 --> 01:14:33.436]  It's on Infowars.com if folks want to go look that up for themselves.
[01:14:33.716 --> 01:14:35.478]  Germany started this five, six years ago.
[01:14:35.878 --> 01:14:37.059]  They banned fireplaces.
[01:14:37.099 --> 01:14:38.680]  They banned space heaters.
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:40.342]  Now California's doing that.
[01:14:40.582 --> 01:14:43.504]  This is a global, totalitarian, organized program.
[01:14:44.545 --> 01:14:45.246]  Understand that.
[01:14:45.566 --> 01:14:47.868]  It's not about being loving.
[01:14:47.948 --> 01:14:52.271]  They use our goodwill, our innate classical liberalism that came from the West
[01:14:53.268 --> 01:15:01.595]  As a psychological warfare tool, a virus to get us to just stand down, run up a white flag, and accept anything they want, including sexualizing our children.
[01:15:02.396 --> 01:15:04.798]  All right, back to the live transmission with David Knight.
[01:15:04.838 --> 01:15:09.662]  I'll be back live this Sunday, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m., with the Sunday transmission.
[01:15:10.043 --> 01:15:12.605]  If you are watching or listening to this transmission, spread the word.
[01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:13.746]  We have the power.
[01:15:14.026 --> 01:15:14.727]  We have the will.
[01:15:14.807 --> 01:15:15.487]  We have the truth.
[01:15:15.527 --> 01:15:18.010]  We can reverse the scientific, technological
[01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:19.651]  Tyranny that's taking over.
[01:15:19.911 --> 01:15:22.713]  But it's up to you to activate and realize you are the answer.
[01:15:22.954 --> 01:15:24.375]  You are the solution with God's help.
[01:15:24.755 --> 01:15:25.576]  Back to David Knight.
[01:15:27.261 --> 01:15:27.941]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:15:28.001 --> 01:15:32.003]  What Alex said is so true, the way they're balkanizing the society.
[01:15:32.043 --> 01:15:37.006]  Because, you know, we've got a massive economic collapse, perhaps, on the horizon.
[01:15:37.026 --> 01:15:39.087]  We're going to talk about that later in the broadcast.
[01:15:39.887 --> 01:15:49.272]  But to put a bookend on what Alex was just saying, you know, of course, today we had the South Carolina governor sign legislation to remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol.
[01:15:49.352 --> 01:15:51.713]  So now we're all safe from racism.
[01:15:51.773 --> 01:15:52.674]  It's all over with.
[01:15:53.374 --> 01:16:00.480]  It was amazing to watch this weeping woman who said she was a descendant of Jefferson Davis yesterday and take it down, a Republican as well.
[01:16:02.442 --> 01:16:13.832]  She said, we are telling, if we don't take this down, we are telling the people of Charleston, South Carolina that we don't care that your people were killed because they were killed with a flag, is what she said.
[01:16:14.773 --> 01:16:15.634]  I thought they were shot.
[01:16:16.704 --> 01:16:19.606]  I thought they were shot by one deranged individual.
[01:16:20.227 --> 01:16:27.893]  And among part of his derangement is his misunderstanding or adoption of these racist ideas.
[01:16:29.054 --> 01:16:35.639]  We need to understand that we can't banish all Southern culture.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:45.286]  Many years ago I had a business, it was a video store business, and Disney would not allow Song of the South be sold in the United States.
[01:16:46.397 --> 01:16:47.678]  They thought it was too controversial.
[01:16:47.698 --> 01:16:52.582]  Of course, they have no problem using Zippity-Doo-Dah everywhere in Disney World.
[01:16:53.202 --> 01:16:57.626]  But they didn't want Song of the South on video in any way, shape, or form.
[01:16:57.646 --> 01:17:02.109]  The only way we could get it was imported Laserdiscs from Japan.
[01:17:02.129 --> 01:17:06.593]  And you know, it's a really innocent, kind story.
[01:17:07.691 --> 01:17:08.892]  But they don't want us to see that.
[01:17:09.472 --> 01:17:10.473]  They want to divide us.
[01:17:10.533 --> 01:17:12.114]  They want us to hate each other.
[01:17:12.434 --> 01:17:20.418]  Play a little bit of a clip of just the beginning of Song of the South, because I want you to hear the character and get a feel for this, in case you haven't heard it in a while.
[01:17:20.458 --> 01:17:21.239]  Play it, roll that clip.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:27.122]  There's other ways of learning about the behind feet of a mule than getting kicked by them.
[01:17:27.282 --> 01:17:27.843]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:17:27.883 --> 01:17:29.063]  Shows up named Reems.
[01:17:29.984 --> 01:17:31.265]  And just cause D.J.
[01:17:31.305 --> 01:17:35.107]  Tales has bought critters like Bear Rabbit and Bear Fox.
[01:17:35.965 --> 01:17:38.850]  That don't mean they ain't the same like can happen to folks.
[01:17:39.551 --> 01:17:42.175]  So them what can't learn from a tale about critters...
[01:17:42.927 --> 01:17:44.948]  Just ain't got their ears tuned for listening.
[01:17:45.368 --> 01:17:47.349]  Yeah, they just haven't got their ears tuned for listening.
[01:17:47.369 --> 01:17:48.270]  They don't want to hear.
[01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:49.871]  They've already got their mind made up.
[01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:52.052]  They want to balkanize society.
[01:17:52.472 --> 01:18:00.756]  They want to paint everybody from a particular group, whether it's some people who want to paint all blacks as bad, other people who want to paint all white people as bad.
[01:18:00.836 --> 01:18:03.317]  You should be guilty about the fact that you're white.
[01:18:03.617 --> 01:18:06.059]  Or if you're Southern, you gotta feel bad about that.
[01:18:06.079 --> 01:18:07.660]  You gotta feel bad about your Southern heritage.
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:09.100]  Listen to what else he says.
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:10.101]  Continue on with this.
[01:18:10.141 --> 01:18:12.002]  This is the introduction to one of his songs.
[01:18:12.022 --> 01:18:12.502]  Go ahead, play it.
[01:18:12.802 --> 01:18:21.125]  I was going fishing, and I was just thinking how the flowers and critters... Actually, just a little bit before that, I'll tell you what he had to say.
[01:18:21.185 --> 01:18:22.746]  He got it cued up a little bit too far.
[01:18:23.286 --> 01:18:28.768]  He said, once upon a time, he said, it's not your time, not my time, but it was one time.
[01:18:29.649 --> 01:18:33.890]  See, we have to understand the things that happened 150 years ago.
[01:18:34.631 --> 01:18:35.871]  Some of them are applicable today.
[01:18:35.911 --> 01:18:36.951]  They show us human nature.
[01:18:36.991 --> 01:18:38.252]  They show us the nature of government.
[01:18:38.272 --> 01:18:40.433]  We need to understand, if we go back and we look at the history,
[01:18:41.536 --> 01:18:43.979]  Read the writings of the people that lived at that time.
[01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:47.063]  And that's one of the beautiful things, actually, about the Uncle Remus stories.
[01:18:47.083 --> 01:18:53.531]  You know, they're actually a collection of stories, folklore, from African-Americans of the time.
[01:18:53.591 --> 01:18:58.797]  The guy who put this together was someone who had lived on a plantation as a child.
[01:18:58.857 --> 01:18:59.698]  They had slaves.
[01:19:00.459 --> 01:19:05.302]  And he would sit at the feet of the older slaves and listen to the folktales that they had created.
[01:19:05.702 --> 01:19:07.343]  He loved those folktales.
[01:19:07.503 --> 01:19:09.644]  I mean, this was... He didn't hate those people.
[01:19:09.684 --> 01:19:13.006]  He loved their stories so much that he put them together in a book.
[01:19:13.346 --> 01:19:14.767]  And you can see that in the movie.
[01:19:14.787 --> 01:19:15.487]  Yeah, run that clip.
[01:19:15.507 --> 01:19:17.668]  You went back and you rewound that clip.
[01:19:17.689 --> 01:19:17.989]  Go ahead.
[01:19:18.009 --> 01:19:19.910]  Once upon a time.
[01:19:20.910 --> 01:19:23.912]  Not your time, nor yet my time.
[01:19:25.173 --> 01:19:25.873]  Not one time.
[01:19:26.633 --> 01:19:27.874]  That's right, that was one time.
[01:19:27.894 --> 01:19:37.602]  And you know, it's interesting, when you erase the history, when you flush it down the memory hole, you're losing a lot of rich history on both sides.
[01:19:38.222 --> 01:19:41.545]  You're losing the history of the people, black and white, in the South.
[01:19:41.985 --> 01:19:43.547]  You're banning the entire thing.
[01:19:44.247 --> 01:19:46.929]  We need to preserve oral history.
[01:19:47.049 --> 01:19:49.050]  We need to preserve our political history.
[01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:54.153]  We need to see what really was the root cause of the Civil War.
[01:19:54.473 --> 01:19:59.797]  And it was the same kind of corporatism and corruption that was a part of it.
[01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:01.017]  They don't want you to see that.
[01:20:01.317 --> 01:20:03.639]  They want to misdirect you onto something else.
[01:20:03.659 --> 01:20:04.119]  Stay with us.
[01:20:04.419 --> 01:20:05.260]  We're going to be right back.
[01:20:11.491 --> 01:20:12.572]  We've all heard the news stories.
[01:20:13.052 --> 01:20:13.773]  Another shooting.
[01:20:14.173 --> 01:20:15.414]  And they're getting worse.
[01:20:15.894 --> 01:20:19.116]  That's why Infidel Body Armor introduces Infidel Fridays.

[01:20:47.872 --> 01:20:51.935]  What if this also restores useless batteries and saves you lots of money?

[01:22:09.789 --> 01:22:13.213]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:14.014 --> 01:22:14.514]  It's true.
[01:22:14.634 --> 01:22:18.595]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:18.795 --> 01:22:20.616]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:21.176 --> 01:22:25.677]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:25.977 --> 01:22:38.540]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:42.382]  Big Berkey Water Filters are the original and most trusted on the market.

[01:22:49.607 --> 01:22:50.228]  Big Berkey.
[01:22:50.428 --> 01:22:53.910]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[01:22:54.130 --> 01:22:55.731]  Get your Big Berkey today.
[01:22:55.891 --> 01:22:58.173]  Call 1-877-99-BERKEY or click BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.

[01:22:58.993 --> 01:23:00.274]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[01:23:00.314 --> 01:23:01.395]  For the love of clean water.
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:11.221]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:23:11.421 --> 01:23:14.763]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:23:15.063 --> 01:23:16.043]  A pair of scissors.
[01:23:16.423 --> 01:23:21.926]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:26.888]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:23:27.128 --> 01:23:27.969]  The phone line.
[01:23:28.109 --> 01:23:33.051]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:23:33.371 --> 01:23:37.113]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:23:37.273 --> 01:23:40.176]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[01:23:40.596 --> 01:23:42.838]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[01:23:43.059 --> 01:23:47.263]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[01:23:47.403 --> 01:23:48.304]  Scissors can't cut it.
[01:23:48.504 --> 01:23:50.726]  And that means your home stays safe.
[01:23:50.746 --> 01:23:54.550]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.
[01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:58.092]  SimpliSafe Home Security keeps you safer than the other guys.

[01:23:59.413 --> 01:24:01.295]  Protect your home with the alarm you can trust.
[01:24:01.415 --> 01:24:02.075]  SimpliSafe.

[01:24:06.178 --> 01:24:07.980]  That's SimpliSafeDefense.com.
[01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:31.171]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:31.231 --> 01:24:31.852]  I'm David Knight.
[01:24:32.492 --> 01:24:35.234]  We're going to be talking to John Rappaport in the next segment.
[01:24:35.274 --> 01:24:39.097]  We're going to be talking about what's going on in California with the removal of informed consent.
[01:24:39.117 --> 01:24:43.620]  And of course, the social engineering in California is just escalating.
[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:51.006]  I mean, we had this report from Alex Jones earlier about banning the terms husband and wife as being discriminatory.
[01:24:51.386 --> 01:24:53.207]  Getting rid of the terms boy and girl.
[01:24:53.408 --> 01:24:58.371]  And of course, the rest of the left coast, the people in Oregon threatening to call
[01:24:59.993 --> 01:25:02.358]  And arrest your children if you're not there on time.
[01:25:02.398 --> 01:25:10.594]  You can pick them up the next day in court and of course they're going to have a hearing as to whether or not you're a fit parent because you didn't pick your child up at time and time from the school.
[01:25:11.513 --> 01:25:20.376]  But as we were talking about in the last segment, and I want to get back to it because Joe Jennings told me something interesting about Disneyland when he visited in the early seventies.
[01:25:20.416 --> 01:25:28.938]  Before we do, I just want to let you know that this segment of the Alex Jones Show has been made possible by our products in the Made in 1776 clothing line.
[01:25:29.398 --> 01:25:33.819]  Everything in the Made in 1776 line is made in America, in the USA.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:38.561]  For a limited time, you can get 25% off our best-selling Milan Labe belt buckles.
[01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:42.503]  Don't get low quality slave goods.
[01:25:42.543 --> 01:25:43.484]  We're talking about slavery?
[01:25:43.824 --> 01:25:44.925]  Let's talk about slavery.
[01:25:44.945 --> 01:25:48.947]  Let's talk about the stuff that's made by slave labor in China.
[01:25:49.047 --> 01:25:52.990]  Stuff that's made by slave labor in the prisons here in America.
[01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:58.253]  The private prisons that have agreements with the government to fill them up so they can make stuff with slave labor.
[01:25:58.773 --> 01:26:00.254]  That's not where our products are made.
[01:26:00.274 --> 01:26:05.238]  We're made in America by people who are workers getting paid for their stuff.
[01:26:06.098 --> 01:26:12.903]  Hang together, get the stuff that says made in 1776, because you know, that's going to be the next thing that is banned.
[01:26:12.923 --> 01:26:21.110]  And again, Moulin Labe is a great time to get those belt buckles, because that's essentially what the Greeks said this last week, the Greek people.
[01:26:21.630 --> 01:26:27.675]  It looks like though, however, the Greek government, the Prime Minister, is not telling them to come and take it.
[01:26:28.035 --> 01:26:32.679]  He is saying, send us some more, we're going to play this extended pretend game a little bit longer.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:43.707]  But right now, Moulin Lave, again, the Greeks standing up to overwhelming force and saying we're not going to back down, that did happen one point in time.
[01:26:43.747 --> 01:26:45.589]  It even happened again this last weekend.
[01:26:46.049 --> 01:26:53.415]  That and 1776, times when people stood up against overwhelming odds and took their freedom.
[01:26:53.435 --> 01:26:59.059]  You can commemorate that, you can put it on your clothing, wear that line, it's made in America, and you can start people talking about it.
[01:26:59.119 --> 01:27:00.881]  Again, go to Infowarsstore.com,
[01:27:01.241 --> 01:27:02.923]  Click on Made in 1776.
[01:27:03.083 --> 01:27:06.026]  It's right up there on the left-hand side.
[01:27:06.727 --> 01:27:18.961]  Now, when we were on break, Joe Jennings came in and told me that he went to Disney World in the 1970s and he said they had a Song of the South ride that then they later took out.
[01:27:19.001 --> 01:27:19.681]  Tell us about it, Joe.
[01:27:20.367 --> 01:27:20.787]  What was that?
[01:27:21.168 --> 01:27:27.953]  Yeah, in the 70s, you know, I was probably six or seven years old and lived in Anaheim.
[01:27:28.573 --> 01:27:38.641]  And, you know, the big treat that you got when you went to Disneyland was, you know, they had all the rides and they rarely changed the rides because it's been there for a long time.
[01:27:39.421 --> 01:27:43.845]  So, in the smaller kids area, they had the Song of the South ride.
[01:27:44.645 --> 01:27:46.766]  And it was just, it was a great little ride.
[01:27:46.846 --> 01:27:49.168]  It had all the fun characters and all this.
[01:27:49.248 --> 01:27:53.110]  And as a child, you never viewed it as racist or anything.
[01:27:53.411 --> 01:27:55.752]  You just saw these fun, whimsical characters.
[01:27:56.472 --> 01:28:03.036]  So, you know, years had gone by and we went back to Disneyland and always thought, hey, you know, I want to go on the Song of the South Pride.
[01:28:03.357 --> 01:28:05.658]  And we went there and it was completely changed.
[01:28:06.058 --> 01:28:06.819]  The ride was gone.
[01:28:06.839 --> 01:28:11.622]  And like I said, Disneyland hardly ever changed their rides.
[01:28:12.803 --> 01:28:16.571]  And we asked, you know, where's this Song of the South ride?
[01:28:17.112 --> 01:28:19.096]  Oh, and we asked one of the Disney people.
[01:28:19.537 --> 01:28:20.959]  Oh, we don't talk about that ride.
[01:28:22.313 --> 01:28:23.733]  It's been taken out.
[01:28:24.073 --> 01:28:24.874]  We gotta take that out.
[01:28:24.914 --> 01:28:28.094]  We gotta take out Song of the South, although they do use the songs from it.
[01:28:28.434 --> 01:28:37.316]  I thought one of the most beautiful things about it was the kids sitting at the feet of the older black man, him relating these folk stories as an introduction.
[01:28:37.336 --> 01:28:39.157]  Of course, it was ahead of its time in the 1940s.
[01:28:39.197 --> 01:28:42.918]  They had mixed animation, mixed with live action, everything.
[01:28:43.118 --> 01:28:47.419]  Look at this article that Kit Daniels walked in in the break and said, yeah, look at the article I just put up.
[01:28:47.779 --> 01:28:48.959]  Unlike the Confederate flag,
[01:28:49.719 --> 01:28:54.721]  Bill Cosby's Hollywood star is not going to be removed because it's quote-unquote historic.
[01:28:55.181 --> 01:28:55.781]  It's historic.
[01:28:56.181 --> 01:29:06.185]  Not the stars and bars, but Bill Cosby's star on the Hollywood Boulevard, even though we have the rising chorus of people talking about
[01:29:07.791 --> 01:29:13.015]  Uh, drugging women, uh, so he could have sex with them, uh, raping them, using drugs.
[01:29:13.875 --> 01:29:21.180]  Looks like that may be, uh, reopened into a criminal investigation, because now one lady has come up where the statute of limitations has not expired.
[01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:24.642]  They have a very short statute of limitations on all this stuff, I believe.
[01:29:24.662 --> 01:29:28.385]  That's why Dennis Hastert, uh, is getting away with a lot of the stuff that he's got.
[01:29:29.085 --> 01:29:40.777]  But nevertheless, it was so egregious that a judge in one of the previous trials opened that up and said, he admitted to doing this and these sealed records.
[01:29:40.857 --> 01:29:42.278]  He could stand it no longer.
[01:29:42.339 --> 01:29:43.239]  So there's no question about that.
[01:29:43.259 --> 01:29:44.581]  But of course, that's okay.
[01:29:44.921 --> 01:29:45.362]  That's okay.
[01:29:45.922 --> 01:29:50.585]  It's, and the historic flag, the Confederate battle flag, that has to be removed.
[01:29:50.845 --> 01:29:52.586]  We're removing our history.
[01:29:52.806 --> 01:29:58.469]  We're taking away any signs that black people and white people can get along together, they can love each other.
[01:29:58.509 --> 01:30:00.150]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with John Rappaport.
[01:30:00.170 --> 01:30:00.671]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.851 --> 01:30:02.472]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.372 --> 01:30:06.074]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.399 --> 01:30:12.980]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:18.681]  First off, I'd like to say congratulations to Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina.
[01:30:18.842 --> 01:30:29.565]  She signed the paperwork to bring down the Confederate flag, thus ending racism and all random acts of violence from random people who take unprescribed drugs and go on killing sprees.
[01:30:29.865 --> 01:30:30.665]  You're a hero!
[01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:33.866]  FBI head, terror panic is the new normal.
[01:30:34.406 --> 01:30:49.794]  Article up at Infowars.com by Steve Watson, FBI head James Comey said Thursday that the Bureau now considers the heightened state of terror alert and increased police presence in major cities enacted for the July 4th holiday as the new normal.
[01:30:50.114 --> 01:30:50.455]  Poll.
[01:30:50.935 --> 01:30:53.298]  1 in 10 British people support ISIS.
[01:30:53.698 --> 01:31:05.232]  In shocking findings published by the Mirror newspaper, an ICM poll has revealed that 1 in 10 people in Britain regard themselves as supporters of the Islamic State terror group.
[01:31:05.532 --> 01:31:08.996]  You can find more articles like this at InfoWars.com.
[01:31:10.117 --> 01:31:11.038]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:31:11.078 --> 01:31:11.479]  Good, brother.
[01:31:11.639 --> 01:31:13.361]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:31:13.381 --> 01:31:15.143]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:31:15.163 --> 01:31:19.328]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:31:19.348 --> 01:31:21.911]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:31:21.971 --> 01:31:24.173]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:31:24.394 --> 01:31:26.376]  Super Mill Vitality was developed.
[01:31:26.676 --> 01:31:27.417]  We're good to go.
[01:31:45.794 --> 01:32:01.783]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience where stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:32:09.949 --> 01:32:29.519]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[01:32:29.679 --> 01:32:30.099]  Well then,
[01:32:30.459 --> 01:32:34.121]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:32:34.501 --> 01:32:35.762]  HDfirearms.com.
[01:32:36.042 --> 01:32:39.243]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[01:32:39.363 --> 01:32:44.246]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[01:32:44.486 --> 01:32:48.208]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[01:32:48.428 --> 01:32:50.709]  Go to their website, HDfirearms.com.
[01:32:50.789 --> 01:32:55.031]  Buy right off their website, and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[01:32:55.211 --> 01:32:58.412]  You can pick it up at the gun show, you can pick it up at a local sporting goods store.
[01:32:58.572 --> 01:32:59.313]  Whatever you do,
[01:32:59.713 --> 01:33:02.698]  Get your Head Down firearm today.
[01:33:02.918 --> 01:33:07.305]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[01:33:07.605 --> 01:33:08.567]  HDFirearms.com
[01:33:26.721 --> 01:33:30.642]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.124 --> 01:33:36.545]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:36.625 --> 01:33:37.245]  I'm David Knight.
[01:33:37.265 --> 01:33:40.206]  We're going to be joining John Rapoport in just a moment.
[01:33:40.226 --> 01:33:43.767]  You know, we've been talking about world government being ushered in.
[01:33:43.787 --> 01:33:50.089]  We've been talking about economic collapse, the things that have happened this week in China as well as in Greece.
[01:33:50.469 --> 01:33:51.630]  And of course, our government
[01:33:52.330 --> 01:33:55.272]  Is rapidly consolidating an iron fist.
[01:33:55.292 --> 01:33:59.694]  And that's what we're going to talk to John Rappaport about, is the coming medical tyranny.
[01:33:59.734 --> 01:34:00.934]  We can see how that's developing.
[01:34:01.215 --> 01:34:04.776]  Just look at the way our police act in this country, for example.
[01:34:05.297 --> 01:34:07.438]  We have several headlines here, about a week apart.
[01:34:07.818 --> 01:34:09.459]  Here's this first headline from the Washington Post.
[01:34:09.479 --> 01:34:14.221]  Norwegian cops fired their guns twice last year and didn't hit anyone either time.
[01:34:14.642 --> 01:34:15.822]  Then we have a week later.
[01:34:15.842 --> 01:34:17.643]  1 in 13 people in the U.S.
[01:34:18.083 --> 01:34:20.425]  killed by guns are killed by police.
[01:34:21.405 --> 01:34:22.866]  And then this headline that just came out.
[01:34:23.146 --> 01:34:28.988]  SWAT raids a wrong home, breaks windows, then issues a family citation for broken windows.
[01:34:29.028 --> 01:34:31.489]  This is like something straight out of the movie Brazil.
[01:34:32.190 --> 01:34:35.931]  Where they get the wrong person, they come in and issue them citations for this.
[01:34:36.472 --> 01:34:38.292]  But understand that there's another aspect to it.
[01:34:38.332 --> 01:34:44.295]  It's not just the iron fist of a continuously militarized and increasingly militarized police.
[01:34:45.696 --> 01:34:48.817]  And that's being driven from a central agenda in Washington.
[01:34:49.237 --> 01:34:50.358]  That's one aspect of it.
[01:34:51.257 --> 01:35:12.294]  The other aspect of it, of course, is going to be this medical tyranny that we see being established in California first, and then they're going to roll that out through the rest of the country, because they put out bills all over the country at the same time the one in California passed, because people there just seem to be accepting of that sort of thing.
[01:35:12.334 --> 01:35:13.855]  Joining us now is John Rappaport.
[01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:16.997]  He's worked as a freelance investigative reporter for over 30 years.
[01:35:17.398 --> 01:35:20.040]  His website is nomorefakenews.com.
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:26.282]  He has really been following closely what's going on in California with SB 277.
[01:35:26.322 --> 01:35:41.606]  Of course, he is very well informed about what's going on with the big pharmaceutical companies and that kind of tyranny, but specifically we want to talk about the kind of medical tyranny that gets ushered in when they take away your informed consent.
[01:35:41.686 --> 01:35:43.086]  Joining us is John Rappaport.
[01:35:43.126 --> 01:35:43.586]  Thank you, John.
[01:35:44.527 --> 01:35:45.607]  Good to be here, thanks.
[01:35:46.636 --> 01:35:58.722]  So give us your take on what's going on with SB 277 and where you see this happening, because this is all part of the broader iron fist that's being collectively created to control us, isn't it?
[01:35:59.623 --> 01:36:00.323]  It is indeed.
[01:36:01.624 --> 01:36:05.246]  During the run-up to the passage of Obamacare, I warned people about this.
[01:36:05.326 --> 01:36:07.067]  I said it's all connected.
[01:36:08.428 --> 01:36:12.370]  The vaccines, the toxic medical drugs, and most of all,
[01:36:13.479 --> 01:36:23.173]  The mandating of all of this treatment on the population to debilitate, weaken, confuse, kill large numbers of people.
[01:36:24.389 --> 01:36:35.431]  I've been reporting on various studies of the last seven or eight years about the death toll in America from the medical system, the medical cartel in America.
[01:36:36.171 --> 01:36:45.933]  At a conservative rate of 225,000 Americans killed by the medical system every year, 2.25 million people killed per decade.
[01:36:46.373 --> 01:36:48.994]  This is all documented in the public.
[01:36:50.237 --> 01:36:58.321]  And it's all connected to the National Health Insurance Plan now because millions more people are going to be brought into this system.
[01:36:59.121 --> 01:37:11.967]  And vaccine mandating is part of this because, of course, you're injecting extremely high toxic chemicals and many germs into children and adults.
[01:37:13.058 --> 01:37:16.060]  And putting their immune systems at risk, to say the least.
[01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:24.305]  So, the thing that happens with the medical cartel is they fly under no particular obvious banner.
[01:37:24.906 --> 01:37:26.687]  They say, well, we're completely neutral.
[01:37:26.727 --> 01:37:27.687]  We care about you.
[01:37:27.727 --> 01:37:30.229]  That's all we want to do is help you, and so forth.
[01:37:30.649 --> 01:37:33.311]  We're not from any political party, and so forth.
[01:37:33.891 --> 01:37:41.096]  And so, as early as 1987, I was pointing out, this is the ideal cover story for a gigantic covert op.
[01:37:41.676 --> 01:37:49.005]  To weaken, debilitate, destroy the resistance in any population to a tyrannical takeover.
[01:37:49.665 --> 01:37:56.093]  And all of these coordinated, mandated vaccine laws and bills that we see now popping up
[01:37:57.254 --> 01:38:09.446]  And as you and I discussed earlier in the week, actually, the plan to immunize all or vaccinate all adults in America and catch up on all missed vaccines.
[01:38:09.706 --> 01:38:10.327]  Yes.
[01:38:10.427 --> 01:38:14.530]  All of these things are in the works and they're all programmed to
[01:38:16.289 --> 01:38:18.933]  Really destroy the population.
[01:38:19.234 --> 01:38:21.096]  And that's the thing that really concerns me too.
[01:38:21.156 --> 01:38:24.001]  Everybody needs to understand that this is a progressive thing.
[01:38:24.041 --> 01:38:31.732]  It isn't going to stop just by saying your kids can't go to a private or public school if they don't take the vaccines that we dictate.
[01:38:32.293 --> 01:38:35.414]  When we take them in the way that we say to take them.
[01:38:35.434 --> 01:38:37.414]  In other words, you're not allowed to space these things out.
[01:38:37.754 --> 01:38:40.435]  You're not allowed to have any delay of that schedule.
[01:38:40.455 --> 01:38:44.315]  You have to do it on their schedule, the vaccines that they dictate to you.
[01:38:44.355 --> 01:38:53.197]  And so that's the scary thing, is that they have established and carved out for themselves the presumption that they can tell you what to take, when you can take it.
[01:38:53.537 --> 01:38:58.498]  And of course, we've seen an explosion in the number of vaccines that they have required people to take.
[01:38:59.505 --> 01:39:10.210]  And this leaves open, John, the idea that any new vaccine, regardless of whether it is adequately tested or whatever, they could force upon the population, children or adults.
[01:39:10.290 --> 01:39:11.651]  And that's the thing that's really concerning.
[01:39:11.671 --> 01:39:15.453]  And the thing that concerns me about that, of course, is that there's no incentive
[01:39:15.913 --> 01:39:16.733]  Let me give you an example of that.
[01:39:16.753 --> 01:39:17.174]  The coming
[01:39:38.587 --> 01:39:52.211]  Research in vaccines is all about developing synthetic genes that they claim will create immunity to diseases and injecting these synthetic genes into the body.
[01:39:52.531 --> 01:39:53.812]  This is not science fiction.
[01:39:54.252 --> 01:39:56.593]  There's a human trial underway right now.
[01:39:56.653 --> 01:39:58.433]  There have been animal studies done.
[01:39:58.953 --> 01:40:03.695]  There are researchers busy at work on this and the bottom line on it is
[01:40:04.295 --> 01:40:11.818]  That the injection of these synthetic genes permanently alters, permanently alters, your genetic makeup.
[01:40:12.258 --> 01:40:16.439]  This is not some just a visitation by a synthetic gene.
[01:40:16.619 --> 01:40:16.859]  Wow.
[01:40:16.879 --> 01:40:18.540]  It takes up permanent residence.
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:19.200]  Wow.
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:25.022]  Which now we're talking about re-engineering the human species and now you... Without our consent.
[01:40:25.162 --> 01:40:25.842]  Without our consent.
[01:40:25.862 --> 01:40:27.623]  Without our consent or even knowledge.
[01:40:27.723 --> 01:40:27.943]  Yes.
[01:40:28.783 --> 01:40:32.933]  And now you see why they're so maniacal about wanting to mandate vaccines.
[01:40:33.294 --> 01:40:33.494]  Wow.
[01:40:34.095 --> 01:40:34.276]  Wow.
[01:40:34.697 --> 01:40:35.899]  That is very, very concerning.
[01:40:36.812 --> 01:40:43.315]  Also this week, we've seen reports about how there are 200 bioweapon labs throughout the country.
[01:40:43.335 --> 01:40:45.315]  It was a report that was done by USA Today, John.
[01:40:46.056 --> 01:40:48.297]  And the reporter asked, is there one in your backyard?
[01:40:48.337 --> 01:40:53.379]  I mean, even in the report, you could look at it state by state, city by city, and see where the labs were.
[01:40:53.499 --> 01:40:56.500]  And at half of these labs, they've had accidents.
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:40:58.301]  I mean, you're talking about bioengineering.
[01:40:58.321 --> 01:41:02.142]  And I know you covered this quite a bit when we had the Ebola outbreak.
[01:41:02.162 --> 01:41:06.184]  Of course, Tulane University, which had been at the center of the
[01:41:06.604 --> 01:41:07.645]  Tuskegee Experiments
[01:41:27.381 --> 01:41:44.670]  Why there is such lax control at these bioweapon labs where they're bringing in, in many cases, deadly bacteria and then trying to give them what they call a gain of function, making them more deadly, making them easier to transmit, easier for us to contract the diseases.
[01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:57.058]  The CDC calls them select agents, and we need to all understand just how difficult, how dangerous this medical experimentation is, and how in bed with the pharmaceutical companies the CDC is.
[01:41:57.098 --> 01:41:58.539]  They're not going to be oversight.
[01:41:58.819 --> 01:42:06.805]  I mean, these are people who are working in a military bioweapon type of facility to make this stuff happen.
[01:42:06.825 --> 01:42:09.927]  They're not going to provide the oversight to make sure that everything is safe.
[01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:25.785]  There are even articles now, and this goes back decades, of mailing, actually sending through the mails, miles of these germs that arrive in broken packages, leaking, and so forth.
[01:42:26.705 --> 01:42:33.332]  The presumption that we're doing this under enormous rules of safety and so forth is a complete ruse.
[01:42:34.132 --> 01:42:36.415]  There are mistakes all the time.
[01:42:36.495 --> 01:42:37.696]  There are leakages.
[01:42:38.677 --> 01:42:39.738]  It's a disaster.
[01:42:39.998 --> 01:42:45.383]  And the more of these labs that exist, as you pointed out, the worse the situation gets.
[01:42:47.125 --> 01:42:54.368]  I remember John, you were criticized when you suggested that perhaps in Sierra Leone this stuff had gotten out.
[01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:56.450]  Certainly the Sierra Leone government thought that.
[01:42:56.810 --> 01:43:03.914]  You were criticized for saying that they could have let this Ebola escape, that the labs could have been the source of this.
[01:43:04.514 --> 01:43:06.535]  We see this happening all over the country.
[01:43:06.615 --> 01:43:11.277]  It's not an unusual event for this to happen all over the U.S.
[01:43:11.337 --> 01:43:13.579]  It's just that it hasn't happened with Ebola yet.
[01:43:13.599 --> 01:43:21.402]  And as you point out, there's been multiple articles just within the last few weeks about the Department of Defense shipping live anthrax through the regular mail.
[01:43:22.363 --> 01:43:22.923]  Exactly.
[01:43:23.543 --> 01:43:32.208]  This all goes back as well, David, to animal testing, which I covered extensively in my first book, AIDS, Inc.
[01:43:33.988 --> 01:43:46.498]  Facilities all around the United States, all around the world, where animals are kept in cages and experimented on with all sorts of drugs, vaccines, combinations of germs.
[01:43:47.499 --> 01:43:50.421]  You know, they become germ factories, these animals.
[01:43:50.922 --> 01:43:55.586]  And the conditions in these places are horrendous, absolutely horrendous.
[01:43:56.486 --> 01:44:01.048]  So this is a story that has flown below the radar for the last 30 or 40 years.
[01:44:01.609 --> 01:44:06.531]  There are certain animal rights activists who have exposed it, but it really hasn't hit the mainstream.
[01:44:07.151 --> 01:44:10.013]  And this is an issue that has really been kept under the radar.
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:17.223]  Yes, that's exactly what happened just recently, again, at Tulane University National Primate Center.
[01:44:17.263 --> 01:44:20.144]  They brought in a bacteria that's not indigenous to North America.
[01:44:20.164 --> 01:44:23.305]  It's only found in two countries in the world.
[01:44:23.345 --> 01:44:24.786]  They brought it in to weaponize it.
[01:44:25.306 --> 01:44:33.369]  They had it in a biosafety level lab three, and somehow it got out into the 500 acres of the National Primate Center.
[01:44:33.889 --> 01:44:34.289]  And that was
[01:44:52.759 --> 01:45:00.224]  I wouldn't be surprised when you start to look in that because this is a bacteria that embeds itself into the soil, into the water and spreads that way out.
[01:45:00.264 --> 01:45:03.846]  So he says, I wouldn't be surprised if you find that in the soil and the water.
[01:45:03.966 --> 01:45:08.829]  And meanwhile, someone at the CDC says, no, you would never find that in North America.
[01:45:08.889 --> 01:45:11.710]  If you find it, it's because it escaped from their lab.
[01:45:11.730 --> 01:45:15.733]  So these are the people that are supposed to be on the watch out for us, that are going
[01:45:15.913 --> 01:45:20.357]  These are the people that are our watchdogs that are going to be watching all this.
[01:45:20.417 --> 01:45:26.321]  At the same time, we see people like in California, this Dr. Pan, who is a senator out there with deep ties and support to the pharmaceutical industry.
[01:45:42.674 --> 01:45:51.215]  Enacting this legislation, SB 277, which basically gives to the AMA and Big Pharma the ability to dictate medical treatments to you.
[01:45:52.293 --> 01:45:52.794]  Exactly.
[01:45:53.194 --> 01:46:13.451]  And you pointed out a very significant thing in an earlier conversation we had this week, which is now that we're seeing the passage of these mandatory vaccine laws, and we know that the pharmaceutical companies have absolutely no liability whatsoever for disasters and death and so forth from vaccines,
[01:46:14.432 --> 01:46:26.960]  The big pharma people will now begin to call many, many, many new treatments vaccines, even though they aren't, because they have complete protection.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:34.084]  They can voice anything on the public they want to and say, well, when we inject genes into your body, you see, this is really a vaccine.
[01:46:34.524 --> 01:46:36.425]  Therefore, no liability.
[01:46:36.526 --> 01:46:37.086]  We're protected.
[01:46:37.833 --> 01:46:38.373]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:46:39.094 --> 01:46:40.294]  It's a dream come true for them.
[01:46:40.734 --> 01:46:47.157]  And of course, this is the kind of corporate fascism, John, as you well know, that is being ushered in with these trade agreements.
[01:46:47.357 --> 01:46:59.301]  This is all about the new model for corporatism, the new model for crony capitalism, for economic fascism, is not just to run the competition out of business by using regulations from the government.
[01:46:59.341 --> 01:47:00.242]  That was the old game.
[01:47:00.962 --> 01:47:06.344]  The new game is to use the government to hold a gun to your head and force you to buy their products.
[01:47:06.444 --> 01:47:14.247]  So whether it's a vaccine or whether it's their inflated health insurance that they want you to get, that's the game that they're going to be playing.
[01:47:14.267 --> 01:47:19.229]  And they're going to be using the Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic partnerships that they're running through.
[01:47:19.249 --> 01:47:20.110]  That's what they're going to do.
[01:47:20.150 --> 01:47:23.231]  They're going to shut down people's information about GMOs.
[01:47:23.591 --> 01:47:27.893]  They're going to extend their patents on everything, not just medicine, but on everything.
[01:47:28.353 --> 01:47:34.948]  They own everything forever, they have monopoly control of everything and they can use the government to hold it under your head and make you buy their product.
[01:47:36.414 --> 01:47:46.683]  Not only that, but in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, for example, a country can send a drug, a medical drug, into another country, you know, as a product.
[01:47:46.743 --> 01:47:48.064]  We want to sell this product.
[01:47:48.845 --> 01:47:56.291]  And the country that's importing it says, wait a minute, the government says, we think this drug is dangerous and we don't want to use it on our people.
[01:47:56.731 --> 01:47:57.152]  Bang!
[01:47:57.672 --> 01:48:01.476]  That triggers a corporate tribunal, secret tribunal,
[01:48:02.216 --> 01:48:11.262]  Where the exporting pharmaceutical company now raises hell about the fact that, you know, under this treaty, you have to accept this drug.
[01:48:12.143 --> 01:48:16.946]  You can't say that it's unsafe because we're now all part of the same club.
[01:48:17.286 --> 01:48:19.147]  And if we say it's safe, it's safe.
[01:48:19.247 --> 01:48:23.390]  And you have to let it go through or pay, you know, billions in fines.
[01:48:23.870 --> 01:48:29.334]  So we're going to see more and more dangerous drugs and vaccines introduced into the pipeline of
[01:48:30.234 --> 01:48:39.763]  And this is not a theory.
[01:48:39.803 --> 01:48:45.869]  We've already seen this happen because we've seen the same type of mechanism put in place with the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[01:48:46.089 --> 01:48:48.311]  We've seen it put in place with the European Union Treaty.
[01:48:48.531 --> 01:48:53.596]  And of course, John, when the corporations come in under the same mechanism, of course, it's going to be
[01:48:54.557 --> 01:48:59.461]  The same mechanism of these tribunals between the investors and the state.
[01:48:59.501 --> 01:49:02.444]  They call it investor-state arbitration.
[01:49:03.635 --> 01:49:08.058]  It's going to be the same mechanism but on steroids when we go to these new treaties.
[01:49:08.158 --> 01:49:19.604]  But the way it has already worked, we've seen that they will come in, in the case of Australia was a good example, they had a new labeling law on cigarette packages and it was actually being effective.
[01:49:19.624 --> 01:49:24.827]  They were educating people as to the risks of tobacco and people were not buying it, not buying the cigarettes.
[01:49:24.887 --> 01:49:31.331]  And so Big Tobacco went in under these trade agreements and sued the Australian government
[01:49:31.531 --> 01:49:36.193]  And said, you're either going to take this off or you're going to pay us damage for the profits that we lost.
[01:49:36.273 --> 01:49:44.056]  And I think it's interesting that the lawyers who represent the multinational corporations in these agreements, they call themselves treaty lawyers.
[01:49:44.196 --> 01:49:55.440]  Everybody knows that these things are treaties, and one of the major frauds that's being perpetrated on us, and both parties are as guilty as sin, is to say that this is not a treaty, that it's a trade agreement.
[01:49:55.780 --> 01:50:01.646]  Or it's a partnership, or it's this, or it's that, or it's a, you know, it's a pink penguin or whatever.
[01:50:02.047 --> 01:50:03.148]  It is a treaty.
[01:50:03.268 --> 01:50:09.254]  Whenever you make an agreement like this, this is a treaty, and it needs to have 67 votes in the Senate, which they don't have.
[01:50:09.515 --> 01:50:11.737]  So again, they play games with the language.
[01:50:12.057 --> 01:50:14.900]  But this is the kind of economic fascism we've already seen.
[01:50:15.481 --> 01:50:31.116]  And we're going to see it far more than this because, as Senator Sessions has pointed out, there's going to be an international committee that is going to set over the nations and tell them what they can and can't do in terms of food, in terms of health, in terms of medicine, and that's just the beginning.
[01:50:32.130 --> 01:50:32.390]  Yes.
[01:50:33.331 --> 01:50:36.553]  It overrides any national laws, these treaties.
[01:50:37.033 --> 01:50:47.580]  Once they're signed, they have sudden precedence over any laws that the Congress would pass, over any decisions made by appeals courts or the Supreme Court.
[01:50:48.561 --> 01:50:50.062]  It just overrides all of that.
[01:50:50.382 --> 01:50:53.926]  And of course we can see that in the fact that they're doing this in secret.
[01:50:54.127 --> 01:50:59.613]  That they're not going to allow our Congress or any other Congress in any other country to make any adjustments to this.
[01:50:59.914 --> 01:51:02.237]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back with John Rappaport.

[01:54:05.338 --> 01:54:06.778]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[01:54:32.254 --> 01:54:37.757]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight and we're talking to John Rappaport of nomorefakenews.com.
[01:54:38.158 --> 01:54:45.062]  We're talking about the loss of informed consent, the danger that that presents to us in terms of medical tyranny.
[01:54:45.702 --> 01:54:53.327]  Before we do, before we go back to John, I just want to let you know this hour of the Alex Jones Show is brought to you by the high quality products that we sell at infowarslife.com.
[01:54:53.347 --> 01:54:56.849]  Products like Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[01:54:57.389 --> 01:54:58.930]  It's something I take every day.
[01:54:59.430 --> 01:55:01.612]  For me, it's a no-brainer and it's very easy to take.
[01:55:01.912 --> 01:55:04.794]  A lot of the supplements that we sell are liquid.
[01:55:04.834 --> 01:55:10.298]  I like the fact that I can just take them all very quickly, very easily without having to swallow a lot of different pills.
[01:55:10.878 --> 01:55:18.983]  I know that I need this in my diet because I know that our food has been depleted in many different ways of many vital minerals.
[01:55:19.404 --> 01:55:27.149]  Again, if you want to get other people's opinions about it, if you want to see what it's doing for other people, you can see that there's over 400 reviews on Infowarslife.com.

[01:55:40.678 --> 01:55:42.439]  That's infowarslife.com.
[01:55:43.834 --> 01:56:03.918]  Now John, we were talking about what's going on in California in particular, and as I watch these hearings and everything, one of the things that bothers me, which also bothers me about the arguments for global warming, is that we're never allowed to have a discussion about what's really going on, about the data.
[01:56:04.458 --> 01:56:05.099]  We're good to go.
[01:56:21.721 --> 01:56:23.923]  And do exactly as they're told.
[01:56:23.983 --> 01:56:30.828]  And that's the real danger, I think, is that people surrender their lives to people in authority.
[01:56:30.868 --> 01:56:32.429]  They don't do their own research.
[01:56:32.769 --> 01:56:34.390]  They don't take control of their lives.
[01:56:34.410 --> 01:56:36.111]  They just turn it over to the experts.
[01:56:36.211 --> 01:56:39.033]  And the experts, they believe, are going to act in their own interest.
[01:56:39.073 --> 01:56:42.436]  Yet, they have a very hardcore agenda themselves, don't they?
[01:56:43.675 --> 01:56:46.836]  Yeah, this is a major, major problem that you're talking about.
[01:56:47.276 --> 01:56:48.536]  They call it a hearing.
[01:56:49.056 --> 01:56:54.677]  We're going to have a public hearing in the State Senate about vaccines and about mandating them.
[01:56:55.257 --> 01:56:59.858]  And then you watch it and you're waiting for a substantive discussion.
[01:57:00.578 --> 01:57:10.860]  Where is the doctor who is saying, look, I want to present evidence that contrary to what you may believe, vaccines are not safe and are not effective.
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:12.641]  Where is that?
[01:57:14.183 --> 01:57:21.694]  There are many people out here who are quite willing to provide chapter and verse and evidence on this but they never get a hearing.
[01:57:22.134 --> 01:57:26.060]  There is never a genuine debate based on data.
[01:57:26.801 --> 01:57:31.625]  It's just made to look like a hearing, so that people will say, well, they had a hearing.
[01:57:32.066 --> 01:57:33.647]  Well, there was public comment.
[01:57:33.807 --> 01:57:35.649]  Okay, so now they passed the law.
[01:57:35.729 --> 01:57:37.490]  Well, that's the best we can do.
[01:57:37.890 --> 01:57:39.652]  It's like watching a political campaign.
[01:57:40.112 --> 01:57:44.336]  Slogans, lies, accusations, and then it's all over and people will vote.
[01:57:45.076 --> 01:57:45.797]  It's horrendous.
[01:57:46.197 --> 01:57:54.785]  And many, many more people have to wake up and do their own research and decide for themselves what the truth is and then stand on it.
[01:57:55.345 --> 01:58:00.668]  Yeah, we just had a former vice president of Pfizer who blew the whistle on this whole process.
[01:58:00.708 --> 01:58:05.050]  And what he said was, you know, you see these studies, these scientific studies, he goes, they don't mean anything.
[01:58:05.490 --> 01:58:09.172]  He says, you have to understand that these people exist by getting grants.
[01:58:09.432 --> 01:58:14.034]  And he goes, the universities and the government don't have anywhere near the funds.
[01:58:14.074 --> 01:58:15.955]  They get all their money from big pharmaceuticals.
[01:58:16.015 --> 01:58:16.376]  And he said,
[01:58:17.256 --> 01:58:23.363]  There's an implied understanding that when you do your study, you're going to find in the way they want you to find.
[01:58:23.804 --> 01:58:26.307]  To portray their product in a positive light.
[01:58:27.668 --> 01:58:28.828]  Otherwise, you've got no job.
[01:58:29.068 --> 01:58:30.028]  That's right, absolutely.
[01:58:30.408 --> 01:58:45.231]  Thank you so much, John Rappaport, and you can get more of his information at nomorefakenews.com, an excellent site to inform yourself as to what the real risks are, and to look at it from the standpoint of what you can do to take control of your life.
[01:58:45.271 --> 01:58:47.271]  Thank you so much for joining us, John Rappaport.
[01:58:47.291 --> 01:58:48.332]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:58:53.112 --> 01:58:56.853]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:00.259 --> 01:59:06.421]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:59:06.501 --> 01:59:09.142]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:59:09.162 --> 01:59:15.944]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:59:16.224 --> 01:59:19.065]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:59:19.205 --> 01:59:22.146]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:59:22.166 --> 01:59:24.147]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:59:24.187 --> 01:59:27.028]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:59:27.108 --> 01:59:32.609]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:59:32.829 --> 01:59:36.310]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.

[02:00:24.141 --> 02:00:27.782]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.342 --> 02:00:32.384]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:40.183]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this July 10th, 2015.
[02:00:40.244 --> 02:00:41.305]  I am David Knight, your host.
[02:00:41.945 --> 02:00:44.007]  Joining us at the bottom of the hour is going to be Joe Biggs.
[02:00:44.027 --> 02:00:45.249]  We're going to talk about a couple of things.
[02:00:45.269 --> 02:00:48.452]  Of course, Jade Helm is coming up very soon.
[02:00:48.532 --> 02:00:55.079]  We're also going to talk to him a little bit about the way the Confederate flag issue has been handled.
[02:00:55.119 --> 02:00:55.619]  And of course,
[02:00:56.701 --> 02:00:57.242]  We're good to go.
[02:01:14.742 --> 02:01:17.043]  That's the common thread with all this.
[02:01:17.083 --> 02:01:22.585]  They ignore the person, they ignore what drugs they're on, but they focus on the gun.
[02:01:22.625 --> 02:01:25.605]  Well, he used such and such a gun, so we need to ban those guns.
[02:01:25.686 --> 02:01:27.926]  Now they're doing the same thing with the flag.
[02:01:28.006 --> 02:01:29.987]  But see, there's a different agenda about this.
[02:01:30.916 --> 02:01:42.886]  They have a political agenda, and of course, what's troubling is to see that the inanimate objects that are representing this agenda, that they're actually trying to balkanize the public.
[02:01:42.906 --> 02:01:44.908]  So we're going to talk to him a little bit about that as well.
[02:01:45.328 --> 02:01:46.729]  There is some good news today.
[02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:51.713]  We have Maine becoming the sixth constitutional carry state.
[02:01:51.793 --> 02:01:56.277]  They just signed a constitutional carry, and if you don't know what constitutional carry means, that means that
[02:01:57.358 --> 02:02:00.000]  They recognize that you have a right to keep and bear arms.
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:00.580]  Period.
[02:02:01.041 --> 02:02:01.321]  Okay?
[02:02:01.801 --> 02:02:03.102]  That's what the Constitution says.
[02:02:03.382 --> 02:02:06.324]  It recognizes that as a fundamental right.
[02:02:06.404 --> 02:02:08.846]  It's not a privilege, not a license that you get granted.
[02:02:09.166 --> 02:02:14.390]  It is a fundamental right, and Maine has now become the sixth state to do that.
[02:02:14.410 --> 02:02:17.372]  We've had some movement in that direction even here in Texas.
[02:02:17.412 --> 02:02:20.674]  Texas had some of the worst carry laws, surprisingly.
[02:02:21.635 --> 02:02:26.759]  They had some movement on this earlier this year, but we still are not at constitutional carry.
[02:02:27.299 --> 02:02:35.244]  Also, in terms of firearms, there's an interesting article on USA Today that the Army is now considering hollow-point bullets for a new pistol.
[02:02:36.104 --> 02:02:48.832]  You remember when we were talking about the massive purchase of ammunition, how they were buying billions of rounds of ammunition, how that was enough ammunition that would last them for a conflict like the Iraq War at its peak for decades?
[02:02:48.972 --> 02:02:49.952]  Remember when we talked about that?
[02:02:50.172 --> 02:02:54.015]  And remember when we pointed out that it was hollow-point bullets?
[02:02:55.066 --> 02:03:18.525]  that that is uh... not something that the military uses this is all for domestic law enforcement consumption they point out the army is considering the use of expanding and fragmenting ammunition such as hollow point bullets now they say there's a myth out there that expanding and fragmenting bullets are prohibited in international armed conflict but that doesn't make any sense now said a pentagon spokesman
[02:03:18.985 --> 02:03:19.185]  Yeah.
[02:03:19.585 --> 02:03:20.705]  It's not actually a myth.
[02:03:20.725 --> 02:03:31.848]  They actually point out that this was an 1899 Hague Convention rule that on the battlefield you would not use bullets that expand or flatten easily in the human body.
[02:03:31.948 --> 02:03:34.729]  So he says, yeah, but we never really signed that.
[02:03:34.769 --> 02:03:35.969]  We weren't a signatory on that.
[02:03:36.009 --> 02:03:37.889]  But everybody agreed to that.
[02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:39.670]  And of course, the U.S.
[02:03:39.710 --> 02:03:47.272]  Army, even though they didn't sign that, they did not use hollow point bullets because that was an agreement that it was inhumane.
[02:03:47.312 --> 02:03:47.852]  Nevertheless,
[02:03:48.752 --> 02:03:54.536]  Every country's law enforcement uses hollow point bullets against its own citizens, you see.
[02:03:55.016 --> 02:04:08.065]  Hollow point bullets at the dum-dum armory in India, they used to call them dum-dums and call them hollow points, they were specifically created to do maximum damage for crowd control.
[02:04:08.605 --> 02:04:11.127]  They were always set up for civilian use.
[02:04:11.347 --> 02:04:12.628]  They're a very expensive round.
[02:04:13.028 --> 02:04:17.211]  That's another aspect of this that we continually pointed out to the critics.
[02:04:17.271 --> 02:04:18.152]  We could show them
[02:04:18.732 --> 02:04:38.897]  The orders from Homeland Security and they would ignore that these massive purchasing orders and say well look you know this the small agency over here bought 50,000 of them so it's just for training it's just for target practice and so it makes no sense to use essentially anti-personnel bullets if you want to put it that way for target
[02:04:39.717 --> 02:04:41.820]  They're extremely expensive.
[02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:43.041]  That's not what they're used for.
[02:04:43.081 --> 02:04:44.503]  They're used for crowd control.
[02:04:44.903 --> 02:04:51.571]  And now this underscores yet again what we've been saying all along, that our government is stockpiling hollow point bullets.
[02:04:51.591 --> 02:04:57.458]  But I guess now we're going to start using them for the military, because they're going to start using the military on us.
[02:04:58.079 --> 02:04:58.519]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:04:59.501]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:10.029 --> 02:05:12.772]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[02:05:13.112 --> 02:05:16.195]  Today is July 10th, 2015.
[02:05:17.316 --> 02:05:24.003]  Now we are five days away from Jade Helm commencing over a number of states.
[02:05:24.444 --> 02:05:32.272]  Just down the road in Bastrop, we're expecting troops to converge on this town, conducting exercises in people's property.
[02:05:32.512 --> 02:05:40.577]  And we now know that the military has released a statement saying that media will not be allowed to film these exercises.
[02:05:40.878 --> 02:05:49.583]  But they keep telling us time and time again that InfoWars is just crazy, we're out of our mind to even think or question this exercise.
[02:05:49.804 --> 02:05:56.748]  But in previous exercises, media has been allowed to film these training events.
[02:05:57.028 --> 02:06:02.312]  I want to encourage each and every single one of you to grab a camera, get off your butt and go out and film these exercises.
[02:06:02.512 --> 02:06:04.438]  They can't keep this from us.
[02:06:04.759 --> 02:06:05.903]  We know what's going on.
[02:06:06.144 --> 02:06:07.348]  We're gonna expose it.
[02:06:07.468 --> 02:06:09.013]  We're gonna bring it down!
[02:06:09.887 --> 02:06:13.069]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:06:13.389 --> 02:06:21.393]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:06:21.633 --> 02:06:26.656]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:06:27.056 --> 02:06:29.337]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:06:29.577 --> 02:06:31.378]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:07:18.693 --> 02:07:26.800]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:31.782]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:07:31.962 --> 02:07:38.685]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:38.765 --> 02:07:45.827]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:07:45.927 --> 02:07:52.790]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:57.316]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:07:57.436 --> 02:08:00.701]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[02:08:07.130 --> 02:08:08.812]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[02:08:25.345 --> 02:08:27.551]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:28.012 --> 02:08:33.146]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:37.998 --> 02:08:39.319]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:39.379 --> 02:08:41.740]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Friday, July 10th, 2015.
[02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:49.424]  One of the articles that I came across today that really, really disturbed me was this story of a SWAT raid.
[02:08:49.945 --> 02:08:50.525]  This was in St.
[02:08:50.565 --> 02:08:50.845]  Louis.
[02:08:50.885 --> 02:08:51.966]  They raided the wrong home.
[02:08:52.006 --> 02:08:53.106]  They break the windows.
[02:08:53.447 --> 02:08:56.688]  Then they issue a family citation for the broken windows.
[02:08:56.728 --> 02:08:57.749]  Listen to how this breaks down.
[02:08:58.683 --> 02:08:59.963]  The family's sitting down for dinner.
[02:09:00.204 --> 02:09:06.266]  If you've ever seen, again when I read this, it was just like straight out of the movie Brazil by Terry Gilliam.
[02:09:06.666 --> 02:09:10.347]  Kind of a cross between 1984 and Monty Python's Flying Circus.
[02:09:10.367 --> 02:09:12.588]  He's one of the guys that was involved in it, the American.
[02:09:13.008 --> 02:09:14.569]  He directed that film.
[02:09:14.609 --> 02:09:20.291]  Again, this is the kind of dystopia that we live in, the kind of dysfunctional dystopia that we live in.
[02:09:20.891 --> 02:09:22.672]  They point out the family sitting down to dinner.
[02:09:22.832 --> 02:09:25.493]  All of a sudden, flash grenades bang through the house.
[02:09:25.653 --> 02:09:26.833]  Everything starts to explode.
[02:09:26.893 --> 02:09:27.973]  The front doors kick down.
[02:09:28.113 --> 02:09:29.194]  Armed assailants rush in.
[02:09:29.514 --> 02:09:33.015]  AR-15 rifles drawn and pointed at Walker and his family.
[02:09:33.615 --> 02:09:39.237]  These armed and incredibly incompetent, dangerous assailants, according to Free Thought Project, were members of the St.
[02:09:39.277 --> 02:09:40.918]  Louis Police Department's SWAT team.
[02:09:41.846 --> 02:09:43.927]  Now, here's where it gets even more interesting.
[02:09:44.547 --> 02:09:45.468]  They're at the wrong house.
[02:09:45.528 --> 02:09:46.949]  They realize they're at the wrong house.
[02:09:47.009 --> 02:09:53.832]  But for two hours, they go over everything in the house, even though this isn't the house of somebody who is dealing drugs.
[02:09:54.152 --> 02:10:02.977]  And listen, to all the conservatives out there, just understand that this violent intrusion is an enforcement of a UN agenda.
[02:10:03.597 --> 02:10:05.238]  You think they're not going to get violent with UN Agenda 21?
[02:10:06.749 --> 02:10:19.633]  You need to understand that the drug war that Richard Nixon declared was ten years after the UN created its drug prohibition agenda, even having the four schedules of drugs there.
[02:10:19.733 --> 02:10:24.615]  It was verbatim an enactment of the UN agenda, just like we see done with the UN Agenda 21.
[02:10:25.615 --> 02:10:33.698]  The UN comes up with an agenda for getting everybody out of their private property, forced into the cities, and then they leave it up to the individual localities to enforce that.
[02:10:33.778 --> 02:10:36.379]  That's precisely what they did with the drug war.
[02:10:36.399 --> 02:10:39.020]  But nevertheless, these people had nothing to do with that.
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:40.401]  They're totally innocent of any of that.
[02:10:40.421 --> 02:10:42.161]  So they stayed there for two hours.
[02:10:42.221 --> 02:10:44.002]  They said they knew they were at the wrong address.
[02:10:44.322 --> 02:10:46.463]  Nevertheless, they tore the house apart.
[02:10:46.983 --> 02:10:50.806]  In search of a non-existent reason to justify what they had done.
[02:10:50.846 --> 02:11:04.538]  And they point out, of course, that if he had been surprised and tried to defend himself, as we've seen many people do when your house is invaded by armed people, your instinct is to defend yourself, you get killed and you wind up a statistic.
[02:11:04.618 --> 02:11:09.442]  And it would have been on the nightly news that he was shot while he was trying to kill the police.
[02:11:10.489 --> 02:11:11.670]  Forget the fact that they initiated.
[02:11:12.190 --> 02:11:13.491]  Nevertheless, this is what they did.
[02:11:13.911 --> 02:11:17.094]  They couldn't find anything, so they called a building inspector.
[02:11:17.934 --> 02:11:24.259]  They couldn't find anything illegal that they could hang on these people to justify their raid, so they called a building inspector.
[02:11:24.339 --> 02:11:29.702]  Two hours later, he goes around and he sees broken windows, which the SWAT team broke.
[02:11:30.723 --> 02:11:32.725]  And then he gives them a citation.
[02:11:33.712 --> 02:11:34.713]  For the broken windows.
[02:11:35.373 --> 02:11:36.754]  That's what Tim did.
[02:11:37.394 --> 02:11:37.694]  Okay.
[02:11:38.295 --> 02:11:41.877]  This is the absurdity straight out of Brazil.
[02:11:41.917 --> 02:11:43.218]  Like I say, you know, is it Buttle?
[02:11:43.358 --> 02:11:43.918]  Is it Tuttle?
[02:11:44.278 --> 02:11:44.798]  Who cares?
[02:11:44.859 --> 02:11:45.979]  You know, we don't make mistakes.
[02:11:46.119 --> 02:11:47.540]  We just go ahead.
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:49.121]  If you haven't seen that movie, you need to see it.
[02:11:49.141 --> 02:11:50.902]  It's one of my all-time favorite movies.
[02:11:51.022 --> 02:11:52.163]  I watch it at least once a year.
[02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:55.201]  Anyway, this is what happened.
[02:11:55.241 --> 02:11:56.742]  And this is not the first time this has happened.
[02:11:56.962 --> 02:11:57.283]  In St.
[02:11:57.323 --> 02:11:59.484]  Louis, they did the same thing.
[02:11:59.624 --> 02:12:00.645]  Raiding the wrong house.
[02:12:00.765 --> 02:12:02.066]  They had a military-style raid.
[02:12:02.086 --> 02:12:03.067]  The house was destroyed.
[02:12:03.127 --> 02:12:04.228]  Their dog was killed.
[02:12:04.268 --> 02:12:05.369]  Their mother was kidnapped.
[02:12:05.769 --> 02:12:09.592]  And the reason was because they were behind on their gas bill.
[02:12:10.814 --> 02:12:11.874]  We've seen that happen before.
[02:12:11.894 --> 02:12:16.737]  A few years ago, the Department of Education did an armed SWAT team.
[02:12:16.757 --> 02:12:20.338]  This is when they were not nearly as common as they are now.
[02:12:20.518 --> 02:12:26.661]  An armed SWAT raid on a family where the mother was behind in her student loans.
[02:12:27.501 --> 02:12:37.006]  A year prior to this happening, the Washington Post had looked at the procurements by the Department of Education and said, why are they buying militarized equipment?
[02:12:37.026 --> 02:12:41.869]  Why are they buying bulletproof vests and helmets and shotguns and all this stuff?
[02:12:41.909 --> 02:12:43.750]  Why is the Department of Education arming itself?
[02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:46.051]  And then within a year, you see exactly why.
[02:12:46.531 --> 02:12:51.113]  Because it was their intention to go around and use SWAT raids to collect on student loans.
[02:12:51.153 --> 02:13:04.540]  And it was even worse, after they drug these people out, drug the husband, drug the kids out, face down, on the ground, in the middle of the night, they found out that the mom hadn't lived there for many years, who was behind on her school loans.
[02:13:05.260 --> 02:13:08.562]  Is that a reasonable way to come after people?
[02:13:09.628 --> 02:13:13.794]  Now of course, like I said, the Washington Post realized that because they looked at the procurements.
[02:13:13.914 --> 02:13:18.981]  And we've talked about our government buying billions of rounds of ammunition.
[02:13:19.602 --> 02:13:23.287]  So much that they could fight something at the level of the Iraq War for many decades.
[02:13:24.244 --> 02:13:25.886]  And we question what's going on with that.
[02:13:25.946 --> 02:13:28.369]  And of course they would spin that and say, it's just for target practice.
[02:13:28.389 --> 02:13:29.831]  We say, no, it's not for target practice.
[02:13:29.871 --> 02:13:32.134]  Not that quantity and not the kind of bullets.
[02:13:32.214 --> 02:13:34.337]  And just as I mentioned in the last segment, the U.S.
[02:13:34.397 --> 02:13:36.179]  Army, this is reported by USA Today, the U.S.
[02:13:36.219 --> 02:13:40.405]  Army is going to now buy hollow points for a new pistol that they have.
[02:13:40.445 --> 02:13:42.747]  Because see, the Army didn't use hollow points.
[02:13:43.268 --> 02:13:48.170]  They were banned by the Hague Convention of 1899, and they point out, well, the U.S.
[02:13:48.190 --> 02:13:48.851]  didn't sign that.
[02:13:48.951 --> 02:13:53.753]  Nevertheless, they abided by that, did not use hollow-point bullets in battle.
[02:13:53.813 --> 02:14:01.477]  No, hollow-point bullets were reserved by the domestic police to be used against their own citizens in the individual countries.
[02:14:01.517 --> 02:14:03.138]  And, of course, they're a very expensive round.
[02:14:03.418 --> 02:14:05.979]  They're not something that you would use for target practice.
[02:14:06.279 --> 02:14:11.902]  They're something you use to control the population with a jackboot on their throat.
[02:14:12.702 --> 02:14:13.822]  This Washington Post article.
[02:14:13.943 --> 02:14:16.804]  One in thirteen people killed by guns are killed by police.
[02:14:16.844 --> 02:14:20.925]  They say that's a rate of about one every nine hours or two and a half shootings per day.
[02:14:21.926 --> 02:14:26.968]  By comparison, cops in Germany killed only eight people from 2013 to 2014.
[02:14:27.028 --> 02:14:28.668]  Two year period.
[02:14:29.149 --> 02:14:32.050]  British police didn't kill anyone last year.
[02:14:32.070 --> 02:14:33.570]  Okay?
[02:14:33.790 --> 02:14:35.351]  Another story from the Washington Post.
[02:14:35.591 --> 02:14:37.712]  Norwegian cops fired their guns twice last year.
[02:14:38.072 --> 02:14:39.933]  Didn't hit anyone either time.
[02:14:40.313 --> 02:14:41.914]  Yet, not in the U.S.
[02:14:42.930 --> 02:14:43.971]  The cops in the U.S.
[02:14:44.011 --> 02:14:46.433]  are responsible for 8% of the gun deaths.
[02:14:46.974 --> 02:14:52.439]  And then they go on to say, well, it's undoubtedly justifiable in many of these cases or in self-defense.
[02:14:52.499 --> 02:14:53.961]  It's like, I have to ask you this question then.
[02:14:54.361 --> 02:14:59.746]  Why is it that the other cops in other countries don't feel the need to kill people in self-defense?
[02:15:00.526 --> 02:15:02.707]  Why is it they don't feel that that's justifiable?
[02:15:03.227 --> 02:15:05.528]  It's because it's the way they're being trained now.
[02:15:05.828 --> 02:15:10.170]  The training is very different now for the police than it was not too long ago.
[02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:21.113]  Again, back in New Mexico when there was the shootings, many of the shootings, it came to light that people in Albuquerque were being shot at a higher rate even than in New York City when you normalized it for the population.
[02:15:21.153 --> 02:15:21.654]  We had that
[02:15:22.774 --> 02:15:30.428]  That shooting that went viral of the homeless man in the hill, so everybody started focusing on that, but they'd been under investigation for that prior to that.
[02:15:31.829 --> 02:15:42.353]  It was in the state, the New Mexico State Police Training Academy, that they put in what one of the long-term instructors called a shoot-first curriculum.
[02:15:42.553 --> 02:15:45.034]  This is something that's being driven from Washington.
[02:15:45.074 --> 02:15:48.455]  This is an agenda that's coming out of Washington, this militarization of the police.
[02:15:48.755 --> 02:15:58.979]  Just like they're putting the MRAPs and all these small-town police departments, they are training them to act this way, to shoot first, to come after civilians like this.
[02:15:59.679 --> 02:16:05.444]  That instructor who'd worked there for many decades blew the whistle on it, and he refused to teach that curriculum, and he resigned.
[02:16:05.984 --> 02:16:12.109]  But now the people who've taken his place, they're going to teach that curriculum, because that's the way it is working in the United States.
[02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:23.725]  And of course, that is part of the control that is coming down, the iron fist that is going to enforce the law as we are staring at economic collapse.
[02:16:24.085 --> 02:16:25.346]  And again, what's going on in China?
[02:16:25.366 --> 02:16:28.947]  We've had this massive movement this week with China and with Greece.
[02:16:29.388 --> 02:16:30.948]  Here's something that puts it in perspective.
[02:16:30.988 --> 02:16:31.929]  This is from Market Watch.
[02:16:32.912 --> 02:16:35.873]  They say China's stock market crash is just the beginning.
[02:16:36.473 --> 02:16:44.635]  They say the Chinex Index, which is one of their stock market index, lost 42% of its value over the last 21 days.
[02:16:44.695 --> 02:16:46.435]  It wasn't just this crash the beginning of this week.
[02:16:46.675 --> 02:16:55.717]  They say investors and traders who piled into Chinese shares over the past year caused the Shanghai to rise 150% other markets to catapult even more dramatically.
[02:16:56.457 --> 02:17:00.179]  Then, they faced margin calls, because they were highly leveraged.
[02:17:00.540 --> 02:17:01.040]  Just like 1929.
[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:04.002]  Remember the feeding frenzy in 1929?
[02:17:04.382 --> 02:17:11.687]  Everybody was buying everything on margin, and people were saying, hey, you know, the shoeshine boy just went down and bought stocks.
[02:17:12.307 --> 02:17:15.389]  That is what has fueled what's going on in China.
[02:17:15.429 --> 02:17:29.036]  And of course, this is something that is tied to the derivatives market, which was what caused the 2008 collapse, which was put onto the various countries like Greece that made their sovereign debt so unsustainable.
[02:17:29.117 --> 02:17:34.059]  It's all connected, it's all related, and the chickens are coming home to roost.
[02:17:34.700 --> 02:17:36.741]  They say Shanghai opened up strongly at 8.5% by Monday.
[02:17:39.242 --> 02:17:46.425]  Despite Greece's no vote, they said, but then shares slipped throughout the trading day and closed up only two and a half percent.
[02:17:47.266 --> 02:17:52.248]  That was a clear sign that the government had taken its best shot and failed.
[02:17:52.268 --> 02:18:03.093]  They point out secular bear markets feature sudden violent rallies and then many bull markets will come in that will fool people into thinking that they're the genuine article that it's all over with.
[02:18:03.293 --> 02:18:05.834]  It's also called a dead cat bounce.
[02:18:07.162 --> 02:18:10.906]  And that may be what we're seeing with some of these small movements here.
[02:18:10.926 --> 02:18:18.494]  They say the Great Recession and a domestic real estate bust are the fundamentals behind what's going on in China.
[02:18:18.514 --> 02:18:24.200]  And I remember at the end of the year, I had an interview with Gerald Salenti, and he sat there with a paper out of China.
[02:18:24.921 --> 02:18:25.942]  And he said, look at this.
[02:18:26.322 --> 02:18:28.283]  This is a massive real estate bubble.
[02:18:28.323 --> 02:18:29.804]  They understand what's going on in China.
[02:18:29.844 --> 02:18:31.466]  They're very alarmed about it in the Chinese press.
[02:18:31.486 --> 02:18:33.527]  But he goes, you don't see anything about it in the New York Times.
[02:18:33.807 --> 02:18:35.328]  You don't see anything about it in the Wall Street Journal.
[02:18:35.348 --> 02:18:38.250]  You don't see anything about it in any of the US papers.
[02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:42.673]  And he said, this is going to come home to roost, and we're starting to see that.
[02:18:43.014 --> 02:18:50.239]  That's why many people don't believe that this crash was something that is just temporary.
[02:18:51.004 --> 02:18:58.049]  They've also pointed out that this was equivalent to losing the entire economy of India.
[02:18:58.109 --> 02:19:05.714]  This wipeout that came out, the amount of equity that was lost was equivalent to the entire economy of India.
[02:19:06.055 --> 02:19:07.436]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:19:07.776 --> 02:19:10.658]  They say China has lost the equivalent of 15 Greases.
[02:19:12.449 --> 02:19:14.570]  And their market capitalization just in three weeks.
[02:19:14.590 --> 02:19:23.954]  In other words, the value of the stock market in China has gone down 15 times the size of the entire Greece economy.
[02:19:23.994 --> 02:19:30.237]  This is also another article up on Infowars.com, why China has no choice but to arrest the sellers.
[02:19:30.817 --> 02:19:37.821]  They say after dozens of separate interventions, manipulations, central planning machinations over the last three weeks, China's resorted to threats.
[02:19:38.641 --> 02:19:41.522]  Calling for the arrest of hostile short sellers.
[02:19:42.162 --> 02:19:50.206]  So the reason they want this so Orwellian is because they have lost so much money and there was a zero, that's a zero hedge article that was won earlier in the week.
[02:19:51.886 --> 02:19:56.428]  They had some jokes of people showing pictures of a Chinese guy saying, I didn't swear.
[02:19:56.448 --> 02:19:57.509]  I didn't sell.
[02:19:57.569 --> 02:19:58.469]  I swear I didn't sell.
[02:19:58.989 --> 02:20:00.490]  So this is what they're going to do.
[02:20:00.510 --> 02:20:05.312]  They're going to start arresting people who sell their stocks because that's the way the communists do things.
[02:20:05.692 --> 02:20:06.132]  Stay with us.
[02:20:06.392 --> 02:20:08.073]  We'll be right back with more economic news.
[02:20:10.473 --> 02:20:11.674]  You know about RVs.
[02:20:11.874 --> 02:20:13.115]  You've heard about bunkers.
[02:20:13.335 --> 02:20:15.896]  But surviving is not recreation.
[02:20:16.096 --> 02:20:18.598]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[02:21:11.118 --> 02:21:14.724]  China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[02:21:14.764 --> 02:21:17.769]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[02:21:17.969 --> 02:21:19.291]  Does that sound right to you?

[02:21:44.289 --> 02:21:45.570]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:21:45.930 --> 02:21:48.252]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:21:48.753 --> 02:21:50.614]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:21:51.054 --> 02:21:55.097]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[02:22:11.192 --> 02:22:17.395]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[02:22:17.935 --> 02:22:21.716]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[02:22:22.337 --> 02:22:25.298]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[02:22:25.838 --> 02:22:26.418]  Not fun!
[02:22:26.959 --> 02:22:34.782]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[02:22:35.362 --> 02:22:40.124]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.

[02:22:45.728 --> 02:22:53.214]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[02:22:53.594 --> 02:22:59.659]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.

[02:24:26.124 --> 02:24:31.148]  And I want to go back to what's happening in Greece as well as in China.
[02:24:31.208 --> 02:24:32.689]  There's some interesting news there.
[02:24:32.729 --> 02:24:41.396]  Also, Eric Holder, as Matt Tiabi of Rolling Stone points out, is essentially a Wall Street double agent who is coming in from the cold.
[02:24:42.097 --> 02:24:45.259]  He's now retired and gone back from whence he came.
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:50.904]  And we're going to talk a little bit about that as well as his legacy, what he did there and what he did not do.
[02:24:51.004 --> 02:24:52.325]  I want to cover that article as well.
[02:24:53.158 --> 02:24:56.742]  This segment of the Alex Jones Show is brought to you by Super Male Vitality.
[02:24:56.762 --> 02:24:57.663]  You know, summer is here.
[02:24:58.263 --> 02:25:01.106]  Now is the time to transform your body and get healthy.
[02:25:01.727 --> 02:25:06.091]  Super Male Vitality combines the best organic herbs and extracts to help make that possible.
[02:25:06.411 --> 02:25:09.194]  And again, like our other products, you can read the reviews online.
[02:25:09.214 --> 02:25:14.139]  There's over 500 reviews on Infowarslife.com about Super Male Vitality.
[02:25:14.179 --> 02:25:14.959]  Here's just one of them.
[02:25:16.260 --> 02:25:19.382]  Excuse me, this is from Dr. Rock in North Texas.
[02:25:19.422 --> 02:25:22.964]  He says, I'm an occupational therapist, militarily trained.
[02:25:23.324 --> 02:25:25.165]  I travel a lot without a lot of rest.
[02:25:25.225 --> 02:25:33.369]  I feel this product energizes me to present myself as energetic, positive, and to have energy left over for the rest of my daily activities.
[02:25:33.810 --> 02:25:36.931]  Again, you can look at those reviews at Infowarslife.com.
[02:25:37.391 --> 02:25:38.852]  Super male vitality.
[02:25:39.112 --> 02:25:39.352]  Get it?
[02:25:39.412 --> 02:25:43.415]  While we still have it in stock, because these products sell out pretty quickly, actually.
[02:25:44.415 --> 02:25:50.359]  As I was just pointing out in the last segment, of course, Greece is a very small problem compared to China.
[02:25:50.980 --> 02:25:56.744]  China's $2 trillion loss in just the last 17 days is the equivalent to losing the entire economy of India.
[02:25:57.164 --> 02:26:02.788]  This is from the article by Zero Hedge on Infowars.com, why China has no choice but to arrest the sellers.
[02:26:02.808 --> 02:26:09.273]  And they also point out it's the equivalent to losing 15 Greeces in the same amount of time.
[02:26:09.913 --> 02:26:24.125]  It looks like there is now an agreement that Germany is now going to look favorably upon the extend and pretend offer from the Greek Prime Minister Tsipras.
[02:26:25.182 --> 02:26:34.805]  It was interesting, earlier this week, we all got very excited when the Greek people said, you know, we don't want to keep going further and further into debt with these bankers who are starving and blackmailing us.
[02:26:34.865 --> 02:26:36.106]  And of course they are starving them.
[02:26:36.126 --> 02:26:37.626]  They're starving them of capital.
[02:26:38.086 --> 02:26:39.867]  They're starving them of liquidity.
[02:26:39.967 --> 02:26:42.008]  So they said no to the deal.
[02:26:42.968 --> 02:26:50.910]  And it was interesting, I think, when Alex played the clips of Nigel Farage and he was saying, leave with your head held high.
[02:26:51.291 --> 02:26:52.051]  Get out of this.
[02:26:53.363 --> 02:27:21.266]  and they kept cutting back and forth from what the inspirational words I thought Nigel Farage because uh... you know he's he's of the viewpoint that everybody needs to uh... we need to have government that is decentralized where people control their lives and yet as they cut back and forth between these uh... different uh... between him speaking they would cut back to the Greek Prime Minister and he had his head down he looked very angry and I kind of got a feel at that time that he really wasn't uh... he didn't really have his heart in
[02:27:22.286 --> 02:27:23.607]  Uh, to leaving this.
[02:27:23.667 --> 02:27:27.648]  He really didn't want to take, uh, the independence route.
[02:27:28.209 --> 02:27:30.209]  That he wanted to strike an agreement with them.
[02:27:30.289 --> 02:27:44.795]  I thought it was very interesting, you know, a couple of weeks ago, it was not this last weekend when they had the vote, but the previous weekend, in the morning, the Greek finance minister, uh, Yanis Varoufakis, had said, we're not going to put any capital controls on.
[02:27:44.915 --> 02:27:46.776]  By that night, they had capital controls on.
[02:27:47.571 --> 02:27:56.842]  And then through the week he said, look, if the people vote to accept this deal from the European Union, from the European Central Bank, the IMF, I'm going to resign.
[02:27:57.343 --> 02:27:57.923]  Well, they didn't.
[02:27:58.584 --> 02:27:59.465]  But he still resigned.
[02:28:00.066 --> 02:28:02.249]  And I don't know what's going on inside there.
[02:28:02.269 --> 02:28:04.752]  I don't have any special inside knowledge.
[02:28:04.772 --> 02:28:06.093]  I'm just looking at this and thinking,
[02:28:06.954 --> 02:28:12.678]  Perhaps he's of a different mind than this guy who's the Prime Minister there, Tsipras.
[02:28:13.299 --> 02:28:14.760]  Maybe he doesn't want to go along that route.
[02:28:14.780 --> 02:28:20.865]  You know, a couple of months ago, he was writing things like this, Greece will adopt Bitcoin if there's no deal.
[02:28:22.446 --> 02:28:27.390]  He was talking about how they were going to go to a different currency, and it wasn't so much what he had to say about Bitcoin that was interesting,
[02:28:28.322 --> 02:28:35.788]  But the fact that he laid out for people who were critical of that, he said, look, you need to understand what goes on with the Depression.
[02:28:36.108 --> 02:28:38.150]  With the Depression, prices are falling.
[02:28:39.010 --> 02:28:44.235]  When somebody orders materials to make their products, prices are continually falling.
[02:28:44.295 --> 02:28:46.516]  Prices are falling for their finished good.
[02:28:46.837 --> 02:28:51.821]  By the time they get those raw materials in, make their product, and then go to sell it,
[02:28:52.714 --> 02:28:53.615]  The price has dropped.
[02:28:53.755 --> 02:28:55.196]  They may already be in the red.
[02:28:55.236 --> 02:28:58.538]  They may not be able to recover what they have paid for the raw materials.
[02:28:58.859 --> 02:29:03.582]  And what gets even worse is people understand that the prices are falling, so they put off their purchases.
[02:29:04.203 --> 02:29:05.924]  And that makes it even more difficult to sell.
[02:29:06.304 --> 02:29:09.627]  That's why you have a massive economic collapse.
[02:29:09.647 --> 02:29:11.769]  That's why everybody is so afraid of deflation.
[02:29:12.329 --> 02:29:14.751]  That's what brings on things like the Great Depression.
[02:29:15.231 --> 02:29:17.453]  And so he was pointing out that they needed liquidity.
[02:29:17.493 --> 02:29:18.334]  They needed cash.
[02:29:18.914 --> 02:29:35.192]  One of the ways that they would do that, he suggested, was maybe to use something like Bitcoin, some kind of a cryptocurrency, that they could operate outside of the European Union, outside of the central banks, outside of the bondholders, that they would create something that he called a future tax coin.
[02:29:35.672 --> 02:29:39.093]  That doesn't sound very attractive, but it would essentially have been a bond.
[02:29:39.113 --> 02:29:47.135]  You buy it for, let's say, 1,000 euros, as that example he gave, and in two years you sell it back to them for 1,500 euros of tax credit.
[02:29:47.976 --> 02:29:54.137]  That would be a way for them to get liquidity, a way for them to get money because they are being starved by the central bank.
[02:29:54.438 --> 02:29:54.878]  Stay with us.
[02:29:55.118 --> 02:29:55.838]  We're going to be right back.
[02:29:59.318 --> 02:30:02.306]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.249 --> 02:30:05.936]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.600 --> 02:30:15.442]  A new MTV show is publicly shaming white people for what they've done in America.
[02:30:15.842 --> 02:30:17.383]  No, this is not a joke.
[02:30:17.663 --> 02:30:21.945]  It is a huge exercise in white guilt tripping for public consumption.
[02:30:22.105 --> 02:30:32.209]  The documentary White People shows young Americans crying over their white privilege and expressing angst about how they are desperate not to appear racist or offend people.
[02:30:32.449 --> 02:30:38.512]  White People is hosted by journalist Jose Antonio Vargas, an illegal immigrant and amnesty activist.
[02:30:38.752 --> 02:30:46.696]  Vargas also talks to young Native Americans who feel that European settlers did not save the country, rather they invaded and took.
[02:30:47.056 --> 02:30:57.581]  Now while that might be true, the teenagers featured in the show were born centuries after this took place, yet they are being asked to shoulder the burden and share their white guilt.
[02:30:57.801 --> 02:31:01.663]  The show is already being widely criticized on YouTube with one person writing,
[02:31:03.124 --> 02:31:05.365]  Even I know this show is straight-up racist.
[02:31:05.705 --> 02:31:08.887]  Watch the trailer for White People at InfoWars.com.

[02:31:29.616 --> 02:31:30.317]  I don't know.

[02:32:51.530 --> 02:32:56.551]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:33:19.380 --> 02:33:20.862]  We are on the march.
[02:33:21.203 --> 02:33:23.607]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:33:24.369 --> 02:33:28.095]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:34.608 --> 02:33:35.889]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:35.929 --> 02:33:40.510]  In the last segment, we started talking about the economics of what's happening in Greece.
[02:33:40.590 --> 02:33:47.873]  And although it is much, much smaller than what's going on in China, and China is very concerning because it has a lot of parallels to 1929.
[02:33:48.133 --> 02:33:57.477]  Not only are people buying things on margin, and now as the stock market crashes, they get these margin calls, and it causes this cascading effect.
[02:33:57.497 --> 02:34:00.318]  We saw the same thing happen at the beginning of the Great Depression.
[02:34:01.258 --> 02:34:03.759]  It is 13 times the size of the Greek economy.
[02:34:04.039 --> 02:34:09.701]  It is the ascending economy, just as the United States was the ascending economy as the Great Depression began.
[02:34:10.622 --> 02:34:13.383]  Great Britain was the largest economy, but the U.S.
[02:34:13.443 --> 02:34:14.403]  was taking its place.
[02:34:15.203 --> 02:34:24.847]  Similarly, we have the ascending economy China, which is about to become the largest, I think by many measures it already has become the largest, just as it's starting to come up.
[02:34:26.096 --> 02:34:26.737]  I don't
[02:34:43.877 --> 02:34:51.864]  The political machinations of these international, multinational corporations and the efforts to create a world government.
[02:34:51.884 --> 02:34:54.826]  And I think that's one of the aspects of this that's very interesting.
[02:34:54.967 --> 02:35:10.020]  As well as the insights that we get into the vital role of currency and how important it is for countries to control their own currency and not relinquish that control to some privately controlled central bank.
[02:35:10.916 --> 02:35:15.158]  That's the root of the causes of Greece's problems right now.
[02:35:16.119 --> 02:35:21.662]  And of course, this is a competition that's been playing out this last week between the Germans and the Greeks.
[02:35:21.842 --> 02:35:33.189]  As was pointed out, and this is in the... I don't see which newspaper this... Nevertheless, Greece News Live, Greeks and Germans in a rift.
[02:35:33.809 --> 02:35:35.030]  With the rest of Europe.
[02:35:35.230 --> 02:35:37.152]  Actually, it was Germans in a rift with the rest of Europe.
[02:35:37.192 --> 02:35:52.104]  And now it looks like Brussels, this is an article from yesterday, it looks like Brussels has now put pressure on the Germans to bow to the demands of Greece to extend these new terms on these loans.
[02:35:52.144 --> 02:35:53.786]  These are not necessarily good terms.
[02:35:54.386 --> 02:35:56.468]  They're raising the retirement age to 67.
[02:35:57.088 --> 02:36:00.631]  You keep hearing about how they've got these lavish pension funds.
[02:36:00.671 --> 02:36:01.612]  They're retiring early.
[02:36:01.652 --> 02:36:02.773]  Well, maybe that was the case.
[02:36:02.813 --> 02:36:04.494]  It's not going to be the case now.
[02:36:04.775 --> 02:36:04.494]  67.
[02:36:04.795 --> 02:36:07.657]  That's far longer than anybody else in Europe.
[02:36:07.677 --> 02:36:10.439]  And, of course, they're going to cut their pensions by over 40 percent.
[02:36:10.980 --> 02:36:18.466]  But we see the press and a full court press trying to show them as being irresponsible.
[02:36:18.586 --> 02:36:19.247]  Things like this.
[02:36:20.404 --> 02:36:29.558]  From the Telegraph, the Greek government's monthly salary and pensions bill is roughly the equivalent of buying 548 Bugatti Veyrons every month.
[02:36:29.618 --> 02:36:34.225]  Of course, that's a supercar that sells for one or two million dollars.
[02:36:35.299 --> 02:36:35.759]  You know what?
[02:36:36.380 --> 02:36:38.621]  It isn't the pensioners that are getting Bugatti Veyrons.
[02:36:38.641 --> 02:36:41.083]  They're not getting 548 Bugatti Veyrons.
[02:36:41.103 --> 02:36:48.128]  And of course they're not saying that, but that's a very subtle psychological insinuation that they're living above their means.
[02:36:48.788 --> 02:36:56.434]  They put that picture there, oh, you know, this supercar, this luxury car, buying 548 of these multi-million dollar cars every month.
[02:36:56.494 --> 02:37:03.178]  No, the people who can afford that are the Goldman Sachs bankers who engineered this financial crisis.
[02:37:03.979 --> 02:37:05.841]  They're going to have a lot of austerity.
[02:37:05.861 --> 02:37:11.145]  They've already cut 25% of their economy with these previous austerity programs.
[02:37:11.966 --> 02:37:14.989]  They have a 25% unemployment rate amongst youth.
[02:37:15.309 --> 02:37:16.010]  It's 50%.
[02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:19.453]  They are suffering from a depression.
[02:37:19.513 --> 02:37:20.754]  And this is how you get depression.
[02:37:21.274 --> 02:37:23.376]  You dry up the supply of cash.
[02:37:23.676 --> 02:37:26.719]  You cause deflation, just as I was talking about before the break.
[02:37:27.339 --> 02:37:27.700]  And I think
[02:37:28.519 --> 02:37:32.941]  The finance minister who just resigned this last week, and I think he understands that.
[02:37:33.541 --> 02:37:41.405]  And he kind of laid out for people who didn't really understand the roots of depression and deflation, he kind of laid that out for them.
[02:37:41.645 --> 02:37:49.328]  And in his plan, you could see just how desperate the Greek government was to have some control over their economy.
[02:37:49.828 --> 02:37:55.871]  As he was pointing out, all the peripheral economies, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain,
[02:37:56.974 --> 02:37:58.415]  Ireland, what they call the pigs.
[02:37:58.656 --> 02:37:59.096]  Say again.
[02:37:59.596 --> 02:38:03.239]  You know, these are guys who buy 548 Bugatti Veyrons each month, okay?
[02:38:03.259 --> 02:38:04.340]  They call them the pigs.
[02:38:04.941 --> 02:38:08.063]  They're the peripheral economies there, and they're not pigs.
[02:38:08.143 --> 02:38:20.434]  They're people who made the mistake of joining a union that was created by a bunch of central bankers and multinational corporations, and they're having their monetary supplies manipulated.
[02:38:20.454 --> 02:38:22.936]  They can't get any money to fund their economies.
[02:38:23.396 --> 02:38:45.671]  One of the things he came up with, he says, well maybe so that we could kind of escape the constraints of the euro without having to go back to the drachma, the original currency, maybe what we could do is we could create a cryptocurrency, we could call it future tax coin, and we could do things like sell it, you know, buy a thousand euros worth of this and then two years you turn it in for fifteen hundred dollars worth of
[02:38:46.631 --> 02:38:47.671]  Uh, tax credits.
[02:38:48.291 --> 02:38:50.512]  So, in other words, it increases 50% in value.
[02:38:50.592 --> 02:38:52.993]  It's used to offset taxes by the Greek government.
[02:38:53.033 --> 02:38:59.474]  And, of course, it's something that people would be able to freely sell, just as you can buy bonds and you can sell them before they mature.
[02:38:59.494 --> 02:39:01.354]  It would be something that would be increasing.
[02:39:01.795 --> 02:39:12.117]  But he would have to come up with this kind of convoluted scheme only because the IMF and the European Central Bank and the German bankers are starving them of cash.
[02:39:13.134 --> 02:39:15.136]  That's why the ATMs are running out of cash.
[02:39:15.236 --> 02:39:17.838]  They don't have a currency that they can run to.
[02:39:18.338 --> 02:39:20.880]  Bitcoin is going huge in Greece.
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:23.062]  It's going huge all over the world, actually.
[02:39:23.082 --> 02:39:32.269]  They say the customer base has increased with nearly 120,000 transactions occurring each day in early June, an increase of 10 times over the same period in 2011.
[02:39:32.569 --> 02:39:37.834]  They say last week, Coinbase, a Bitcoin exchange and wallet provider,
[02:39:38.374 --> 02:39:42.677]  Waived fees for customers buying with Euros due to the Greek crisis.
[02:39:42.757 --> 02:39:48.560]  Now, of course, the headline from Business Insider says Bitcoin is faltering at a bad, bad time.
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:50.522]  They're having trouble processing.
[02:39:50.542 --> 02:39:54.884]  There's so many people are buying Bitcoin, they're having trouble running through all the processing.
[02:39:54.904 --> 02:39:55.565]  Okay?
[02:39:55.625 --> 02:39:57.126]  Processing all the orders and everything.
[02:39:57.546 --> 02:40:03.929]  Well, it still hasn't collapsed like the New York Stock Exchange, or the Wall Street Journal, or United Airlines.
[02:40:04.409 --> 02:40:06.990]  Okay, so it's not doing as bad as they did.
[02:40:07.810 --> 02:40:13.052]  But it's still interesting that demand is up several hundred percent with Bitcoin.
[02:40:13.152 --> 02:40:14.613]  It's interesting on Twitter.
[02:40:15.513 --> 02:40:27.760]  Max Keiser had tweeted out just before they enacted the capital controls, he put a picture of a thumbnail and he said, this and Bitcoin is the only way you're going to save your money if you live in Greece.
[02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:31.522]  And he was maybe, he's being proven correct.
[02:40:31.742 --> 02:40:34.904]  I think it's also interesting in looking at the hardship of the people there.
[02:40:35.684 --> 02:40:38.506]  They can't get even the most basic medicine.
[02:40:38.806 --> 02:40:42.448]  They can't get insulin for the people who are diabetic.
[02:40:43.985 --> 02:40:47.666]  Do you see anything being done by Doctors Without Borders?
[02:40:49.086 --> 02:40:49.746]  I googled it.
[02:40:49.786 --> 02:40:50.546]  I couldn't see anything.
[02:40:50.746 --> 02:40:51.006]  You know what?
[02:40:51.106 --> 02:40:55.967]  The only thing I found when I looked for Doctors Without Borders in Greece, they're not bringing in any medicine for those people.
[02:40:56.027 --> 02:40:56.668]  Forget about them.
[02:40:56.968 --> 02:40:57.228]  Okay?
[02:40:57.908 --> 02:41:03.049]  They go places where there's Ebola and then they bring it back into our country or whatever.
[02:41:03.609 --> 02:41:11.751]  They were complaining because they said illegal immigrants who had gone into Greece were suffering and not being able to get medical care and treatment and everything.
[02:41:11.771 --> 02:41:13.431]  But the Greek people, they could care less about them.
[02:41:13.911 --> 02:41:15.612]  They're not going to put insulin in there for them.
[02:41:15.872 --> 02:41:17.272]  They're not going to do anything to help them.
[02:41:17.652 --> 02:41:22.674]  This is the crackdown of crony capitalism of the central bankers.
[02:41:22.854 --> 02:41:35.358]  And I want to cover Eric Holder because nothing exemplifies better this kind of corruption and cooperation that we have between the big banks and government than the story of Eric Holder.
[02:41:35.478 --> 02:41:36.860]  This is from Rolling Stones.
[02:41:36.940 --> 02:41:41.005]  It's from Matt Tiabi and this guy is a great investigative journalist.
[02:41:41.045 --> 02:41:49.835]  He's done a lot of stories on the LIBOR scandal, on HSBC and UBS being involved in money laundering for terrorist groups.
[02:41:50.316 --> 02:41:51.337]  This is his story.
[02:41:51.397 --> 02:41:51.898]  Eric Holder.
[02:41:52.398 --> 02:41:54.678]  Wall Street double agent comes in from the cold.
[02:41:54.738 --> 02:42:16.203]  He points out that Holder, who just resigned, he resigned a long time ago and then he kind of hung around, I don't know how many months, six to nine months afterwards, said Holder will reassume his lucrative partnership, he made two and a half million dollars the last year he worked there, and he will take his seat in an office that reportedly, and he says this is no joke, was kept empty for him in his absence.
[02:42:16.943 --> 02:42:25.067]  So he was working for this corporation that was Covington and Burling, which represented big banks.
[02:42:25.507 --> 02:42:33.732]  And they even left his office vacant for him because they knew he was going to be coming back after he continued his work for the same clients.
[02:42:33.752 --> 02:42:34.952]  I'm going to break that down for you here.
[02:42:35.573 --> 02:42:37.534]  He says, though, this is the way he portrayed it.
[02:42:37.614 --> 02:42:45.498]  So he said, I'm going to go back to making millions every year because I am so interested in doing charity work to benefit the public.
[02:42:46.238 --> 02:42:47.279]  This is what Eric Holder said.
[02:42:47.659 --> 02:42:51.842]  Just because I'm at Covington doesn't mean I'll abandon the public interest work.
[02:42:51.882 --> 02:43:01.448]  The firm's emphasis on pro bono work and being engaged in the civic life of this country is consistent with my worldview that lawyers need to be socially active.
[02:43:01.528 --> 02:43:03.249]  And so Matt Tiabi says, yeah, right.
[02:43:03.690 --> 02:43:08.213]  He's going back to Covington and Burling because of the firm's emphasis on pro bono work.
[02:43:08.233 --> 02:43:15.618]  Here's a man who spent six years handing out soft touch settlements to practically every too big to fail bank in the world.
[02:43:16.238 --> 02:43:22.081]  He says collectively the decisions that he made while in office saved these firms, and he lists them.
[02:43:22.121 --> 02:43:25.682]  He says these are firms that they represented, okay?
[02:43:25.722 --> 02:43:32.525]  Firms like Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, just to name a few, he points out, okay?
[02:43:34.306 --> 02:43:37.809]  Former clients of his, and now they are his clients again.
[02:43:37.990 --> 02:43:42.874]  And I would say, and I think Matt Tiabi would say, they were his clients while he was Attorney General as well.
[02:43:43.295 --> 02:43:47.659]  He said he saved them a sum that is impossible to calculate.
[02:43:48.459 --> 02:43:51.022]  He says, Holder doesn't look like it, but he's actually a revolutionary.
[02:43:51.042 --> 02:43:58.209]  He institutionalized a radical, dualistic approach to criminal justice, essentially creating a system of indulgences
[02:43:58.789 --> 02:44:04.911]  We're in the world's richest companies paid cash for their sins and escaped the sterner punishments the law dictated.
[02:44:05.131 --> 02:44:07.952]  And he says, here's the five things that Helder did.
[02:44:08.012 --> 02:44:14.775]  Number one, he failed to get a single conviction in court for any of the crimes related to the financial crisis.
[02:44:14.815 --> 02:44:15.455]  Remember back 2008?
[02:44:15.495 --> 02:44:17.676]  You know, it all happened, was going down.
[02:44:18.056 --> 02:44:18.916]  They got elected on that.
[02:44:18.956 --> 02:44:20.296]  They were going to reform everything.
[02:44:20.336 --> 02:44:21.477]  They didn't do any of that.
[02:44:22.077 --> 02:44:24.040]  Nobody went to jail about any of that.
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:38.178]  Number two, he says, Holder famously invented a concept called collateral consequences, under which the state could pursue non-criminal alternatives for companies if they believe prosecuting them might result in too much collateral damage.
[02:44:38.219 --> 02:44:38.959]  There's an example.
[02:44:39.841 --> 02:44:47.805]  Britain's HSBC, which admitted to massive money laundering in violation of Swiss bank UBS, which manipulated the LIBOR interest rates.
[02:44:47.845 --> 02:44:52.567]  Remember, LIBOR is the London Interbank Exchange Rate.
[02:44:52.988 --> 02:44:57.370]  If you've got a variable rate mortgage, that's what it's tied to, is the LIBOR rate.
[02:44:57.390 --> 02:45:04.593]  As a matter of fact, if you don't have a variable rate mortgage, if you've got a fixed mortgage, they come up with that fixed mortgage rate based on the LIBOR exchange.
[02:45:04.694 --> 02:45:09.276]  They were making money by playing the difference in that.
[02:45:10.205 --> 02:45:11.046]  It was all exposed.
[02:45:11.146 --> 02:45:13.367]  It was something straight out of the movie The Sting.
[02:45:13.387 --> 02:45:18.971]  Remember where they had the horse races and they were delaying the information for the guy?
[02:45:18.991 --> 02:45:22.033]  They knew who was going to win, but they were delaying the information.
[02:45:22.053 --> 02:45:25.515]  They were placing their bets and making money on it and then blaming the people for suckers.
[02:45:25.535 --> 02:45:28.857]  That's essentially what was being done in London.
[02:45:29.958 --> 02:45:34.720]  He says both banks, even though they were let go, even though nobody went to jail, they got fines, okay?
[02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:35.740]  They got fines.
[02:45:35.800 --> 02:45:37.341]  They were too big to jail.
[02:45:37.401 --> 02:45:39.902]  And Eric Holder said that, along with Lenny Brewer.
[02:45:39.942 --> 02:45:42.563]  And of course, Lenny Brewer also worked at the same firm.
[02:45:43.223 --> 02:45:46.165]  They were caught up doing the same thing later on, okay?
[02:45:46.185 --> 02:45:47.205]  They didn't learn their lesson.
[02:45:47.285 --> 02:45:47.545]  Why?
[02:45:47.585 --> 02:45:48.606]  Because they weren't punished.
[02:45:49.126 --> 02:45:54.788]  He says it's worth noting that Holder, before he became Attorney General, represented UBS at Covington and Burling.
[02:45:54.808 --> 02:45:56.689]  So again, another one of the banks that he represented.
[02:45:57.429 --> 02:46:07.916]  They say that his lenient policies were deployed at a time when fellow officials like Geithner and Ben Bernanke were using bailout money to merge troubled firms together to make even larger firms.
[02:46:08.296 --> 02:46:13.400]  See, they were too big to fail, but that didn't stop them from making even bigger companies.
[02:46:13.420 --> 02:46:20.244]  His argument was, we can't punish these guys because they're so big they'll have a negative effect on the entire economy.
[02:46:20.284 --> 02:46:22.165]  We can't take it, shut down HSBC.
[02:46:22.205 --> 02:46:22.866]  They're just too big.
[02:46:23.386 --> 02:46:25.808]  Nevertheless, they're making them bigger and bigger.
[02:46:26.388 --> 02:46:29.310]  And you know, this all started back in the Clinton administration.
[02:46:29.350 --> 02:46:38.898]  I remember when it started because I was in North Carolina and it was Nations Bank being merged with Bank of America and it was someone who was tied to Nations Bank.
[02:46:40.899 --> 02:46:41.500]  What's his name?
[02:46:42.521 --> 02:46:43.742]  Erskine Bowles, okay?
[02:46:44.122 --> 02:46:45.423]  Was in the Clinton administration.
[02:46:45.743 --> 02:46:47.945]  Everybody said this is a merger that is too big.
[02:46:47.985 --> 02:46:51.167]  It's going to set off massive consolidation if they allow this to go through.
[02:46:51.207 --> 02:46:53.930]  Everybody said they're not going to allow, the Justice Department won't allow this.
[02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:55.411]  Well, the Clinton administration did.
[02:46:56.343 --> 02:47:01.926]  Because they had a guy, Erskine Bowles, who had been involved with one of these banks.
[02:47:02.066 --> 02:47:03.647]  So they approved the merger and guess what?
[02:47:03.707 --> 02:47:10.390]  That set off the consolidations that resulted in just a few banks, about seven, that were too big to fail.
[02:47:11.651 --> 02:47:12.072]  We're good to go.
[02:47:33.510 --> 02:47:35.192]  Extrajudicial settlement.
[02:47:35.933 --> 02:47:39.757]  Striking huge deals with companies in which judges didn't sign off on the agreement.
[02:47:39.777 --> 02:47:54.712]  See, this is kind of like the exact opposite of the mandatory minimums, where you've got some guy that's got a pot that he's growing in his closet, and they're going to nail him for 10 or 20 years, and there's nothing that the judge can do about it.
[02:47:54.992 --> 02:48:00.096]  No violence involved, no prior convictions, he's going to go to jail based on the quantity, you know, mandatory minimums.
[02:48:00.156 --> 02:48:02.338]  No, they've got just the opposite for the big guys.
[02:48:02.398 --> 02:48:05.141]  They get extrajudicial settlements, okay?
[02:48:05.321 --> 02:48:06.662]  In other words, leniency.
[02:48:07.543 --> 02:48:10.305]  They say that this institutionalized the backroom deal.
[02:48:10.465 --> 02:48:12.106]  Everything was done in secret.
[02:48:12.807 --> 02:48:13.688]  Our secret government.
[02:48:14.099 --> 02:48:21.847]  Number four, he said, there's a huge misconception that is pushed by people on Wall Street that, quote, they were let off because no one broke any laws.
[02:48:22.448 --> 02:48:23.829]  And actually, that's what Obama said.
[02:48:24.149 --> 02:48:31.397]  Obama said some of the most damaging behavior on Wall Street, in some cases the least ethical behavior on Wall Street, wasn't illegal.
[02:48:32.173 --> 02:48:37.256]  Matt Tiabi points out, yeah, Obama is a great lawyer and he knows how to twist the words.
[02:48:37.556 --> 02:48:42.980]  He says, some of the worst behavior wasn't illegal, it's true, but much of it was.
[02:48:43.100 --> 02:48:46.022]  Listen to what they let these guys off with, okay?
[02:48:46.322 --> 02:48:48.103]  He says, some of this was very illegal.
[02:48:48.603 --> 02:48:56.689]  They got guilty pleas from these guys for crimes like fraud, manipulation, bribery, money laundering, tax evasion.
[02:48:57.569 --> 02:49:02.419]  And this is a description of HSB's crimes from Eric Holder's Justice Department.
[02:49:04.375 --> 02:49:21.001]  As a result of HSBC Bank's USA AML failures, at least $881 million in drug trafficking proceeds, including the proceeds of drug trafficking by the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico, were laundered through HSBC Bank USA.
[02:49:21.061 --> 02:49:23.822]  That's what Eric Holder's Justice Department said.
[02:49:24.222 --> 02:49:27.743]  $881 million in drug trafficking money laundered by HSBC.
[02:49:29.730 --> 02:49:39.020]  And he says, you might remember, this is Matt Tiabi saying, you might remember the Sinaloa cartel had ISIS style torture videos.
[02:49:40.063 --> 02:49:43.006]  But HSBC laundered their cash.
[02:49:43.546 --> 02:49:54.996]  They even created, listen to this, they even created, HSBC, created a special teller window to make sure that the Sinaloa cartel's deposits were made easier.
[02:49:55.016 --> 02:49:55.797]  Do you hear that?
[02:49:56.097 --> 02:49:58.639]  They got their own special teller window.
[02:49:58.679 --> 02:50:02.062]  The people who are making ISIS-like torture videos.
[02:50:02.603 --> 02:50:03.423]  This drug cartel.
[02:50:04.366 --> 02:50:07.688]  They were laundering their money and had a special teller window for them.
[02:50:08.108 --> 02:50:09.468]  This is, he said, admitted.
[02:50:09.989 --> 02:50:10.889]  It is not alleged.
[02:50:11.229 --> 02:50:12.710]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[02:50:13.350 --> 02:50:13.691]  Okay?
[02:50:14.051 --> 02:50:22.555]  This is criminal activity of the highest order that Eric Holder let go for his former, now current, clients.
[02:50:22.835 --> 02:50:23.075]  Okay?
[02:50:23.095 --> 02:50:24.916]  And I would argue they were his clients all along.
[02:50:25.696 --> 02:50:28.478]  Holder went out of his way to let them keep their U.S.
[02:50:28.538 --> 02:50:28.938]  charter.
[02:50:29.938 --> 02:50:32.880]  He gave their executives a grand total of zero days in jail.
[02:50:34.196 --> 02:50:44.903]  Zero dollars in individual fines, and then listen to, and he points out, this is HSB laundering money for guys who chop people's heads off with chainsaws.
[02:50:45.203 --> 02:50:51.248]  And then the last thing that they did was they gave, they called these fines remedial payments.
[02:50:52.108 --> 02:50:55.749]  And that allowed them to write them off as tax deductions.
[02:50:56.149 --> 02:51:04.992]  So even though they claim they get a $7 billion fine at Chase, they get $245 billion of it as a tax write-off.
[02:51:05.172 --> 02:51:07.073]  Isn't it great to have friends in high places?
[02:51:07.553 --> 02:51:09.934]  This is what's going on in our corrupt government.
[02:51:10.314 --> 02:51:12.815]  Affordable health insurance was the promise of Obamacare.
[02:51:12.855 --> 02:51:16.016]  But for many, the government mandate caused more problems than it solved.

[02:51:40.191 --> 02:51:44.354]  All right, so suddenly Walmart, eBay, Amazon, everybody wants to ban the Rebel Flag.
[02:51:44.494 --> 02:51:47.176]  Well, the Rebel Flag is an important part of American history.
[02:51:47.356 --> 02:51:52.939]  The Rebel Flag is still a long-standing symbol of Southern pride and Southern heritage.
[02:51:53.219 --> 02:51:58.363]  So if the big retailers want to play into political correctness and try to deny the history of America, let them.

[02:53:09.656 --> 02:53:10.737]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[02:53:11.438 --> 02:53:12.839]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[02:53:13.300 --> 02:53:14.561]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[02:53:14.781 --> 02:53:15.922]  Mine has fallen apart.
[02:53:16.323 --> 02:53:22.129]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[02:53:22.489 --> 02:53:25.312]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[02:53:25.712 --> 02:53:26.253]  What is that?
[02:53:26.553 --> 02:53:35.660]  Well, apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[02:53:36.100 --> 02:53:44.506]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[02:53:44.826 --> 02:53:45.147]  Wow!
[02:53:45.447 --> 02:53:46.368]  That sounds scary.
[02:53:46.768 --> 02:53:51.111]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet.
[02:53:51.211 --> 02:53:52.032]  Are they more expensive?
[02:53:52.472 --> 02:53:52.692]  No.
[02:53:52.972 --> 02:54:00.236]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[02:54:00.676 --> 02:54:01.496]  Sounds great!
[02:54:01.857 --> 02:54:04.458]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[02:54:04.478 --> 02:54:08.560]  I want to be protected, and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic!
[02:54:23.410 --> 02:54:24.631]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:24.691 --> 02:54:25.311]  I'm David Knight.
[02:54:25.331 --> 02:54:28.333]  I want to cover a little bit about what's going on with Jade Hellman.
[02:54:28.373 --> 02:54:35.899]  Of course, as Joe Biggs is recording the newsflash that he's got up, it's going to be happening in just a few days.
[02:54:35.959 --> 02:54:37.700]  It starts on the 15th.
[02:54:37.840 --> 02:54:41.062]  So I want to talk about a few things that have come up recently with that.
[02:54:41.102 --> 02:54:48.387]  Before we do, this hour of the Alex Jones Show has been made possible by your support of the high-quality products that we sell at Infowarslife.com.
[02:54:48.427 --> 02:54:49.008]  Products like
[02:54:49.648 --> 02:54:52.090]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[02:54:52.110 --> 02:54:54.952]  As I mentioned before, I take this every day.
[02:54:54.972 --> 02:54:56.693]  It's something that's very easy to do.
[02:54:56.773 --> 02:54:57.634]  It's liquid form.
[02:54:58.154 --> 02:55:00.916]  It's not a problem to take liquid supplements.
[02:55:01.036 --> 02:55:03.478]  I like taking liquid supplements because I know that they're
[02:55:04.639 --> 02:55:05.019]  I think so.
[02:55:33.482 --> 02:55:35.266]  That's FForWarsLife.com
[02:55:37.068 --> 02:55:40.929]  Of course, Jade Helm is coming up this next week, about five days out.
[02:55:40.949 --> 02:55:51.071]  The Washington Post recycled this sarcasm from a couple months ago when this came out, you know, trying to downplay the fact that there's anything at all unusual about this.
[02:55:51.111 --> 02:55:52.051]  The Americans are coming!
[02:55:52.071 --> 02:55:53.091]  The Americans are coming!
[02:55:53.791 --> 02:55:56.692]  Some in a Texas county feel that Obama led a U.S.
[02:55:56.732 --> 02:55:57.692]  military invasion.
[02:55:58.312 --> 02:56:01.212]  No, that was not what we said.
[02:56:01.773 --> 02:56:03.453]  That is a strawman argument.
[02:56:04.175 --> 02:56:16.979]  We're very concerned about a lot of things that are happening, and of course, as we talked about, the increased militarization of our police, the increased presence of SWAT teams, how differently our government treats its citizens than most of the developed world.
[02:56:17.019 --> 02:56:28.163]  I mean, we're being treated like citizens of Banana Republic, so it concerns us very much when we see massive exercises, training in cities.
[02:56:29.417 --> 02:56:31.898]  Because you train where you're going to fight.
[02:56:31.978 --> 02:56:34.439]  And then we see this coming up just a few days after that.
[02:56:34.479 --> 02:56:39.920]  After the Washington Post tells us on July 4th, oh don't worry, the Americans are coming, the Americans are coming, no.
[02:56:40.321 --> 02:56:46.803]  Then they tell us they're going to not allow press coverage at Jade Helm 15.
[02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:48.520]  Okay.
[02:56:48.580 --> 02:56:53.703]  Embedded reporters will not be permitted at any point during the exercise, says Lieutenant Colonel Mark Lestori.
[02:56:53.743 --> 02:56:55.504]  He was the guy that was at Bastrop.
[02:56:55.984 --> 02:57:02.788]  As we've documented before, there was inconsistencies in his story, even on the same day, in terms of what he was saying.
[02:57:03.368 --> 02:57:10.271]  Clearly, he's not being straight with people, and you just can't get a straight answer from our government, especially from the military.
[02:57:10.331 --> 02:57:12.813]  If you remember, it was last summer that
[02:57:14.315 --> 02:57:22.399]  There was a Drudge Report article, and they were talking about how they could not control the press, that things were getting out in the Drudge Report, and so forth and so on.
[02:57:22.440 --> 02:57:31.965]  And one of the people at the press conference, one of the younger military officers there, stood up and said, nobody believes what we're telling them anymore.
[02:57:32.405 --> 02:57:35.227]  They just think it's mindless propaganda, because it is.
[02:57:36.127 --> 02:57:41.409]  She confronted the guy from the Pentagon and told him that, and we showed that on videotape at the time.
[02:57:41.669 --> 02:57:45.430]  But they're saying embedded reporters will not be permitted at any point during the exercise.
[02:57:45.470 --> 02:57:54.132]  Then they kind of backpedal and say, well, we'll consider that nothing is finalized, but we're not really going to do that because, of course, this is Special Forces.
[02:57:54.192 --> 02:57:59.434]  But then the Washington Post points out, however, the military has granted access to Special Forces in the past.
[02:58:00.034 --> 02:58:05.679]  They say one recent example, they had a journalist as part of the Robin Sage exercise in North Carolina.
[02:58:05.719 --> 02:58:08.181]  That's an exercise that's been going on for a very long time.
[02:58:08.861 --> 02:58:11.403]  But it is very different than this exercise.
[02:58:11.443 --> 02:58:12.985]  It doesn't go on for two months.
[02:58:13.645 --> 02:58:16.087]  It doesn't involve every member of special forces.
[02:58:16.528 --> 02:58:23.713]  They say this embedded journalist covering Robin Sage in North Carolina wrote a profile for the magazine.
[02:58:25.734 --> 02:58:27.155]  This is not going to happen here.
[02:58:28.035 --> 02:58:31.416]  This is about mastering the human domain.
[02:58:31.476 --> 02:58:34.298]  And if you've not seen our report, you need to look at that.
[02:58:34.358 --> 02:58:37.459]  You need to understand this is about geospatial intelligence.
[02:58:37.799 --> 02:58:43.782]  It's about coordinating the military, using them as boots on the ground for the surveillance state, for the police, for the NSA.
[02:58:44.562 --> 02:58:45.502]  That's what this is about.
[02:58:46.523 --> 02:58:47.924]  We'll be watching this this next week.
[02:58:48.124 --> 02:58:53.486]  We want you to send us your reports when you see something, film something, and tell us about it.
[02:59:00.138 --> 02:59:05.691]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the
