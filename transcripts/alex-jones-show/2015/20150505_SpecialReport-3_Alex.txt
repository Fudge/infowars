[00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:13.154]  You've probably heard of the shooting at the Prophet Muhammad Cartoons Exhibition in Garland, Texas over the weekend.
[00:00:13.254 --> 00:00:19.697]  But did you know Daily Mail used pictures from the event, but bowing to political correctness, blacked out the offensive images.
[00:00:19.977 --> 00:00:23.339]  And thus far, President Barack Obama has been silent about the attacks.
[00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.961]  And CNN used the event to attack the Second Amendment, when it was the Second Amendment that stopped the gunmen in their tracks.
[00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:33.545]  But now we've learned that the FBI has been watching one of the suspects using an FBI informant.
[00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:40.211]  Elton Simpson, the man identified as one of the two gunmen killed, was under surveillance by the FBI and subject of a terror investigation.
[00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:50.420]  The FBI has arranged numerous fake terror plots, including the Washington Metro bombing plot, the New York subway plot, the plan to blow up the Sears Tower in Chicago, the plot to bomb the Portland Christmas tree lighting, and others.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:01:01.006]  In 2014, Human Rights Watch released a report stating nearly all high-profile domestic terrorism plots in the United States after 9-11 included the direct involvement of government agents and informants.

[00:01:04.528 --> 00:01:05.908]  Rob Due reporting for PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:01:07.312 --> 00:01:11.155]  Can the federal government take credit for saving us from a plot of its own creation?
[00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:16.059]  The FBI has foiled about 17 plots to kill Americans during the past 10 years.
[00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.021]  They all have a common and reprehensible thread.
[00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:24.185]  They were planned, plotted, controlled, and carried out by the federal government itself.
[00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:34.616]  In all of these 17 cases, from the Fort Dix 6, to the Lackawanna 7, to the Portland Parade bomber, the feds found young men of Muslim backgrounds.
[00:01:35.156 --> 00:01:36.758]  Loners who were bitter in America.
[00:01:37.018 --> 00:01:42.103]  They befriended them, cajoled them, and persuaded them that they could change the world by killing Americans.
[00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:44.425]  But none of this keeps us safe.
[00:01:45.186 --> 00:01:57.019]  All of this makes us less free as any one of us can be entrapped and we are fools if we praise the government for exposing a plot of its own creation and saving us from a danger that never existed.
[00:02:05.805 --> 00:02:07.366]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:13.829]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:28.578]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running 6 miles every other day, swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights
[00:02:29.198 --> 00:02:29.979]  We're good to go.
[00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.860]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.680]  My muscle mass increased.
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.521]  My stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:02:59.821 --> 00:03:01.321]  Now is the time to take action.
