[00:00:10.796 --> 00:00:14.581]  You may not have heard of this, but there's an organization called Welcoming America.
[00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:17.704]  And as part of that, we have welcoming cities and counties.
[00:00:18.145 --> 00:00:20.308]  Austin is now one of those welcoming cities.
[00:00:20.348 --> 00:00:21.429]  We went to talk to them today.
[00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.334]  I'm here with the chair of the Commission on Immigration Affairs.
[00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:27.450]  My name is Angela Jodota Medina.
[00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.811]  Thank you so much for coming today.
[00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:29.352]  Thank you.
[00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:34.257]  Tell us what the purpose of Welcoming America is, or Welcoming Austin.
[00:00:34.297 --> 00:00:45.309]  Well, the purpose of the Welcoming City Summit is to convene community stakeholders to kind of come together and discuss how welcoming Austin is as a community, and to find a vision for us as a welcoming community moving forward.
[00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.271]  Okay, and when we talk about being a welcoming community, what does that really entail?
[00:00:49.492 --> 00:00:55.756]  Well, one of the things that, so the city of Austin signed on to Welcoming America, became a welcoming city through Welcoming America in September 2013.
[00:00:57.097 --> 00:01:08.584]  And what Welcoming America, its basic platform is cities that are welcoming are cities that integrate immigrants in a way that they can contribute to and benefit from the prosperity of the community as a whole.
[00:01:08.904 --> 00:01:09.145]  Okay.
[00:01:09.325 --> 00:01:10.946]  So it's fomenting immigrant integration.
[00:01:11.326 --> 00:01:16.328]  And so is this for all immigrants or is it for documented immigrants or undocumented?
[00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:17.008]  It's for all.
[00:01:17.028 --> 00:01:18.469]  So we're not differentiating.
[00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:19.829]  We're talking about immigrants in general.
[00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.550]  We're not differentiating.
[00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.911]  We're talking about immigrants in general.
[00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:26.412]  So the operating word here is welcoming.
[00:01:26.892 --> 00:01:29.773]  That sounds so much better than sanctuary cities, doesn't it?
[00:01:30.013 --> 00:01:31.694]  We have welcoming cities.
[00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:32.794]  We have welcoming counties.
[00:01:32.854 --> 00:01:35.835]  We even have the organization Welcoming America.
[00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:40.037]  And of course, their tagline is building a nation of neighbors.
[00:01:40.757 --> 00:01:42.759]  Sounds very much like what Nancy Pelosi said.
[00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:45.603]  We just have one community with a border running through it.
[00:01:45.963 --> 00:01:51.670]  And of course, Petraeus said that this nation that we're building is the nation that comes after America.
[00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.196]  He famously had a topic in a London presentation where he said, what comes after America?
[00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:57.736]  Well, that's easy.
[00:01:58.397 --> 00:01:59.138]  North America.
[00:01:59.178 --> 00:02:01.599]  We've had NAFTA for a very long time, he said.
[00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.760]  20 years.
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.425]  And now we find, 20 years in, that what they were implementing all along is what many of us said they were implementing all along.
[00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:15.589]  Not just a trade agreement, but a complete restructuring, political restructuring, of our sovereignty.
[00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:16.910]  It's nothing less than that.
[00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.552]  Now, of course, in America so far, there's 49 welcoming cities.
[00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:24.015]  The only one in Texas is Austin, but there's six in Michigan.
[00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:26.977]  North Carolina and Ohio have four each.
[00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:29.538]  California and Maryland have three each.
[00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:40.425]  They say on their website, welcoming America is a national grass roots driven collaborative that promotes mutual respect and cooperation between foreign born and US born Americans.
[00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:43.968]  In other words, foreign born illegal aliens are now
[00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:56.082]  We've gone from illegal immigrants to undocumented immigrants, and now they refer to them in the welcoming America, welcoming cities, as just simply newcomers.
[00:02:56.583 --> 00:03:00.308]  This is not something that's limited to Austin or a few states like Michigan.
[00:03:00.668 --> 00:03:03.291]  No, this is national and it is international.
[00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:11.796]  They say that stakeholders will be participating in national and transatlantic learning exchanges to learn about global practices.
[00:03:11.836 --> 00:03:18.119]  And of course, this organization is supported by internationalists and globalists like the Intercultural Innovation Partnership.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.042]  That's the UN, the United Nations, Alliance of Civilizations, and BMW.
[00:03:23.582 --> 00:03:27.083]  Also, organizations like Carnegie and Western Union.
[00:03:27.443 --> 00:03:34.105]  And one of the organizations involved with funding this is the German Marshall Fund, which frequently talks about Atlanticism.
[00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:35.925]  This is a globalist agenda.
[00:03:36.325 --> 00:03:40.907]  They talk about it as not being an agenda, like Agenda 21, because that's gotten kind of a bad rap.
[00:03:40.927 --> 00:03:43.087]  They talk about it as being a framework.
[00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:46.108]  But this framework is not grassroots.
[00:03:46.188 --> 00:03:47.788]  It's coming from the globalists.
[00:03:48.048 --> 00:03:50.249]  Here's what they're talking about as part of that framework.
[00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:56.622]  And in this summit, some of the things that we're covering is where this morning we talked about the economic impact of immigration.
[00:03:56.642 --> 00:04:01.164]  We had a city demographer, Ryan Robinson, come and talk about Austin's multicultural future.
[00:04:01.184 --> 00:04:07.968]  In other words, how we're growing as a community, what ethnicities are influxing and diminishing and, you know, how we're growing.
[00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:11.870]  Then we're also having career pathways for new Americans.
[00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.172]  Tomorrow we're having best practices in immigrant integration.
[00:04:16.132 --> 00:04:22.674]  We're having a specific section on executive action for employees and employers and how that affects the employment environment.
[00:04:23.114 --> 00:04:28.076]  We have one on Austin and immigrant rights, a local perspective from immigrant rights organizations.
[00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:35.578]  So it's a very well thought out agenda just as we see in these Delphi techniques where they present Agenda 21 to people locally.
[00:04:35.638 --> 00:04:41.160]  They say, we want to work with you to help you figure out how to do whatever it is that you want to do in your community.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.982]  But of course, this agenda has already been worked out.
[00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:46.123]  Especially with things like, did you catch what she said?
[00:04:46.544 --> 00:04:52.368]  Executive actions and how they affect the employment workspace between employees and employers.
[00:04:52.448 --> 00:04:56.792]  In other words, Obama's DACA, his DREAMers, his amnesty.
[00:04:57.152 --> 00:04:58.313]  How does that affect people?
[00:04:58.873 --> 00:05:08.040]  Now we know that since 2000, virtually all of the new jobs, the number of new jobs that have been created, are the same as the number of jobs that have been taken by immigrants.
[00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:09.682]  Legal as well as illegal.
[00:05:10.262 --> 00:05:15.125]  So in other words, for native-born Americans, there's been no increase in job opportunities.
[00:05:15.646 --> 00:05:25.872]  There has been a decrease in wages, a decrease in purchasing power, and there will be a massive increase in taxes that we're going to see come along to pay for this entitlement program.
[00:05:26.173 --> 00:05:38.021]  So while we as native-born Americans are seeing fewer job opportunities, no job growth, we're seeing higher unemployment as well as higher taxes, she talks about career paths for immigrants.
[00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:39.742]  Listen to how she spends this.
[00:05:40.482 --> 00:05:44.224]  So what kind of career paths are we looking at that's different?
[00:05:44.284 --> 00:05:49.607]  Well, I think it's just more, well, part of the careers are like STEM and tech fields.
[00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:54.910]  I mean, here in Austin, many of our new techpreneurs are actually foreign born.
[00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.712]  It's like, I think approximately 25% of techpreneurs in Austin are foreign born.
[00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:03.316]  Other pathways might be... Is that typical?
[00:06:03.336 --> 00:06:04.116]  We have a high number.
[00:06:04.156 --> 00:06:05.177]  We're very lucky actually.
[00:06:05.237 --> 00:06:06.899]  I think we're the highest number in Texas.
[00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:12.643]  Are those illegal immigrants or are those people who are coming here because their employer has brought them in?
[00:06:12.964 --> 00:06:17.327]  So they're coming with tech companies for the most part or on special entrepreneurial visas.
[00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:22.952]  And when you're talking about immigration rights, what type of things are we looking at?
[00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:23.513]  What rights
[00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:30.962]  We're talking about, in general, how immigrants are treated in Austin and how, you know, wage theft, issues like that.
[00:06:31.442 --> 00:06:52.834]  So you see she's muddying the water by talking about tech immigrants who have come here legally, brought here by their companies who fill out the paperwork, avoiding the topic of the massive influx of people that they're enticing to come in to go on to the welfare state, to see themselves as entitled to become dependents of native-born Americans.
[00:06:53.414 --> 00:07:03.743]  In terms of rights, though, I mean, when somebody comes here illegally, what type of rights do they, you know, do they have the right to stay, the right to, you know, what do they have a right to?
[00:07:03.763 --> 00:07:04.964]  Do they have a right to education?
[00:07:05.184 --> 00:07:11.149]  I'd say that, so, I think that as a community, we can all agree that anyone who lives here has a right to be treated well.
[00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:15.172]  And that's the rights that we're focusing on, that right to be treated well.
[00:07:15.713 --> 00:07:18.014]  So she says this is just about treating people well.
[00:07:18.803 --> 00:07:19.744]  That's not true at all.
[00:07:20.244 --> 00:07:26.487]  At this seminar, they're talking about how they're going to get driver's licenses for illegal immigrants here in Texas.
[00:07:26.527 --> 00:07:30.309]  And of course, we've seen in other states how they're giving non-citizens the right to vote.
[00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:39.795]  You can't go into any of these countries, I can't, as an American citizen, go to Mexico and get a driver's license, vote there, get a free education there.
[00:07:40.515 --> 00:07:56.666]  This is a globalist agenda that is aimed at all Western countries, using compassion and treating people well, talking about multiculturalism, but it's designed to destroy the countries economically by entitlement programs that are unlimited and by totally open borders.
