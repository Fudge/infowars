[00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:19.239]  Iridium-192, man-made, half-life 73.83 days, can penetrate through 32 millimeters of steel.
[00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.127]  Contact with the radioactive element can cause burns, radiation sickness, and permanent injuries in just minutes.
[00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:31.453]  Used for industrial purposes and medicine as a source of radiation to kill cancer cells,
[00:00:31.553 --> 00:00:36.218]  It is also one of the most commonly stolen isotopes to potentially be used in a dirty bomb.
[00:00:36.438 --> 00:00:41.444]  A radiological weapon that combines radioactive material with conventional explosives.
[00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:46.970]  In Cardenas, Mexico, a small container carrying iridium-192 was stolen from a truck.
[00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.654]  The stolen batch of iridium was intended for industrial radiography.
[00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:51.574]  We're good to go!
[00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:25.730]  The latest wave of thievery of potential dirty bomb materials arrives on the heels of recent dirty bomb drills in the United States.
[00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.594]  But once the trance is lifted, and the sleeping giant is starting to wake up, once the trance is lifted, people have a very fast learning curve.
[00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:37.776]  Once they're broken, the mind control.
[00:01:38.357 --> 00:01:40.518]  But basically all hell is now breaking loose.
[00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:42.419]  The only way to take over is from within.
[00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.100]  It's just a Rosetta about Rome.
[00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:48.788]  The outside invader comes with their banner openly.
[00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:51.550]  It's the traitor within that infiltrates.
[00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.513]  We've been taken over like Vichy France, like Iraq.
[00:01:56.134 --> 00:02:00.457]  We've been infiltrated with a classic CIA, RAND Corporation takeover program.
[00:02:01.178 --> 00:02:04.000]  And it's a big nut to crack, but man, they're doing it.
[00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:09.785]  Conspiracy theories have now been floating around for weeks about a military operation in West Texas.
[00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:16.488]  After an Army presentation last month, Big Spring officials gave them permission to train within city boundaries.
[00:02:16.528 --> 00:02:22.169]  The community will be aware sometime if they're here, and sometime the community won't be aware.
[00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.811]  It'll enhance the ability of them to respond in the future.
[00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:35.752]  John Baum, InfoWars.com We know we're under attack!
[00:02:35.832 --> 00:02:38.493]  We're under attack!
[00:02:42.435 --> 00:02:50.299]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:52.640]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:02:52.781 --> 00:02:55.422]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:02:55.482 --> 00:02:59.584]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:02:59.904 --> 00:03:03.046]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:10.376]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:03:10.537 --> 00:03:14.682]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:03:14.863 --> 00:03:16.545]  We are the true media.
[00:03:16.665 --> 00:03:19.249]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.970]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
