[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:21.346]  Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
[00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:29.543]  What if you were unable to wake from that dream?
[00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:33.545]  How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?
[00:00:38.328 --> 00:00:39.869]  The answer is up there, Neo.
[00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:41.890]  It's the question that drives us.
[00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:44.351]  What is the Matrix?
[00:00:46.592 --> 00:00:50.795]  The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
[00:00:52.536 --> 00:00:54.797]  Human beings are a disease.
[00:00:55.217 --> 00:00:56.458]  You are a cancer of this planet.
[00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:01.349]  I'm the cure.
[00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.735]  They estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:08.677]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[00:01:15.324 --> 00:01:16.526]  The Matrix is a system, Neil.
[00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:19.823]  That system is our enemy.
[00:01:19.843 --> 00:01:23.025]  When you're inside, you look around, what do you see?
[00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:26.727]  Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters.
[00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:29.809]  The very minds of the people we are trying to save.
[00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.112]  But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy.
[00:01:35.372 --> 00:01:39.855]  You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.
[00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:46.699]  And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.
[00:01:48.454 --> 00:01:51.168]  And our Lord and Savior, Barack Obama!
[00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:56.073]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[00:01:56.113 --> 00:01:56.893]  You shouldn't trust me.
[00:01:56.993 --> 00:01:57.934]  I will taint the news.
[00:01:58.074 --> 00:02:00.076]  Our propaganda was beginning to pay off.
[00:02:00.316 --> 00:02:03.298]  Genetically modified sounds Frankenstein-ish.
[00:02:03.338 --> 00:02:06.901]  Drought resistance sounds really something you want.
[00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:10.284]  I am not a dictator.
[00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:11.104]  I'm the president.
[00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:16.869]  This is a full, dishonorable, scientific mafia warfare takedown.
[00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:19.131]  Public policy could itself
[00:02:19.811 --> 00:02:23.672]  Become the captive of a scientific technological elite.
[00:02:23.792 --> 00:02:25.832]  These people are coming for everybody!
[00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:28.033]  I'm not gonna wait around to be soft killed.
[00:02:28.313 --> 00:02:30.493]  I'm not gonna wait around and watch my family die around me.
[00:02:30.793 --> 00:02:32.513]  I'm gonna die fighting!
[00:02:32.553 --> 00:02:33.414]  Take the blue pill.
[00:02:34.274 --> 00:02:35.074]  The story ends.
[00:02:36.074 --> 00:02:38.594]  You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.
[00:02:39.515 --> 00:02:40.475]  You take the red pill.
[00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:42.135]  You stay in Wonderland.
[00:02:43.675 --> 00:02:45.916]  And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[00:02:50.327 --> 00:02:52.029]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.272]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[00:02:57.855 --> 00:02:59.576]  Stop being a moron!
[00:03:00.117 --> 00:03:01.979]  Stop being dishonorable!
[00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.744]  Within 15 years they say, CNN, that everyone will be merged with machines, or will be obsolete.
[00:03:07.784 --> 00:03:10.187]  I'm not gonna stop!
[00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.303]  Hillary Clinton is the most beautiful woman on the planet.
[00:03:22.284 --> 00:03:27.292]  And every man's eye desires to be able to sit in her presence.
[00:03:28.113 --> 00:03:30.557]  And of course we call that fantasy land, we call that hell.
[00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:33.718]  Welcome to the InfoWar, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:33.738 --> 00:03:39.463]  We're now 24 hours and 3 minutes, 25 seconds into this live transmission.
[00:03:39.984 --> 00:03:44.868]  And we are now in the final 4 hours countdown of InfoWar's Money Bomb 2015.
[00:03:45.608 --> 00:03:51.334]  What I hope will be the final fundraiser, not that it's bad to do fundraisers,
[00:03:51.914 --> 00:04:02.501]  The globalists do all sorts of fundraisers and charities and siphon the money off to go after your Second Amendment, to go after your family rights, to go after your property rights, your sovereignty, the list goes on and on.
[00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:26.255]  But in this case, this is simply to add to our war chest to secure the fact that we can go up on satellite, get the closed captioning, and syndicate this radio-slash-TV transmission to men and women all over North America, and then the next phase is to Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa, the Middle East.
[00:04:27.631 --> 00:04:31.673]  And I have no doubt that if you support us and spread the word, we'll be able to do that.
[00:04:32.254 --> 00:04:38.317]  You don't see a lot of American news, period, being broadcast overseas because people don't trust it anymore.
[00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:53.266]  But I have found that information that questions the official narrative is extremely popular overseas, as our metrics and numbers show from InfoWars.com and this radio TV show.
[00:04:54.531 --> 00:05:01.956]  And so it's not going to be about targeting those populations to make money, because putting news internationally on is not probable.
[00:05:02.556 --> 00:05:06.018]  It is about reaching people with a message against the globalists.
[00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:07.819]  Without that, we have no hope.
[00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:08.740]  Stay with us.
[00:05:10.754 --> 00:05:12.757]  Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[00:05:12.957 --> 00:05:19.084]  Do you ever wonder how the current migrant crisis is going to affect Europe and America a decade from now if governments keep handing out welfare?
[00:05:19.405 --> 00:05:25.572]  Well, Sweden has been accepting a lot of immigrants for the past 15 years, and now 58% of the country's welfare payments go to migrants.
[00:05:25.993 --> 00:05:30.198]  The majority of violent crimes in Sweden are committed by first or second generation immigrants.
[00:05:30.598 --> 00:05:32.758]  Most of them refuse to assimilate into Sweden's culture.
[00:05:32.978 --> 00:05:35.839]  Even more shocking, nearly half the immigrants don't work.
[00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:39.900]  And now Sweden has the biggest employment gap in Europe between natives and non-natives.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:47.721]  In other words, native Swedes are working their butts off to support an immigrant population who won't work and won't assimilate, but will steal, rape, and murder.
[00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:53.342]  Simply put, when a government offers free goodies and welfare to immigrants, the country is only going to attract the worst kinds of people.
[00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:56.683]  But what's going on in Sweden is now going to happen in the United States.
[00:05:56.983 --> 00:05:59.745]  This is a new America brought to you by Obama and his puppet masters.
[00:05:59.946 --> 00:06:02.027]  More decadence, less prosperity and freedom.
[00:06:02.208 --> 00:06:06.151]  Keep checking back at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for more reports.

[00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:20.477]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:22.718 --> 00:08:28.439]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:08:31.465 --> 00:08:37.729]  We are now 24 hours 8 minutes and 25 seconds into this worldwide broadcast.
[00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.991]  We kicked off the transmission at 11 a.m.
[00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:42.332]  Central yesterday.
[00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:47.996]  It is now Thursday the 17th day of September 2015.
[00:08:48.076 --> 00:08:57.422]  We have Larry Klayman who in federal court a few years ago had the illegal NSA bulk spying tossed out as unconstitutional.
[00:08:59.417 --> 00:09:07.104]  Years later, last week, a federal appeals court basically amended that ruling.
[00:09:10.747 --> 00:09:15.931]  There's a lot of legalese involved in this, so the constitutional lawyer will be popping in for about 30 minutes.
[00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:30.987]  In the third hour today, the fourth hour and final hour of the 28-hour broadcast will be hosted by Leanne McAdoo, Anthony Gucciardi, and others, and they have some special guests and analysis that's coming up as well.
[00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:42.655]  While we're all distracted with the Republican reality TV show and the debates, which we're going to cover here in a moment and play clips of,
[00:09:45.236 --> 00:10:02.747]  The illegal alien Islamic radical invasion of Europe is going into overdrive and high gear and the Hungarian military intelligence head said Muslim refugee crisis endangers Europe and says that, quote, Europe is in the last hour.
[00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:13.895]  There are 800 million Muslims in North Africa and the Middle East and Central Asia
[00:10:15.213 --> 00:10:21.595]  There's another 400 million in Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia and other areas.
[00:10:22.676 --> 00:10:23.776]  And here's the deal.
[00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:42.723]  If they weren't anti-Western before, which they've been in some cases, invading the West, going as far West as East Germany and Poland, and taking over, they certainly are now, after the West went in there,
[00:10:43.766 --> 00:10:48.207]  Put dictators in, then topple those people and put radical Islamists in charge.
[00:10:50.167 --> 00:10:52.368]  So it's classic problem, reaction, solution.
[00:10:52.408 --> 00:10:54.568]  The globalists want to bring down prosperity in the West.
[00:10:54.688 --> 00:10:55.268]  They're doing it.
[00:11:00.789 --> 00:11:05.690]  Now, continuing here, we're going to be breaking all of that down.
[00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.811]  Curt Nemo has a detailed story at Infowars.com.
[00:11:09.191 --> 00:11:09.971]  It's very important.
[00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:12.952]  We have world news, economy news, science news, U.S.
[00:11:12.992 --> 00:11:13.272]  news.
[00:11:15.526 --> 00:11:18.487]  A lot of very interesting police state news we're going to be breaking down.
[00:11:19.567 --> 00:11:26.970]  Everything from NYPD union pres Patrick Lynch says only police are qualified to judge the actions of police.
[00:11:30.951 --> 00:11:40.314]  It's that type of arrogance and hubris that has made the police the brunt of public discontent with the government.
[00:11:41.554 --> 00:11:42.895]  No one is above the law.
[00:11:43.857 --> 00:11:50.382]  And that is a bizarre statement to say that only the police, that is themselves, can investigate themselves.
[00:11:51.863 --> 00:11:54.685]  And some districts do investigate themselves and do a good job.
[00:11:55.346 --> 00:11:58.588]  Still, there's always got to be a check and a balance.
[00:11:59.649 --> 00:12:02.311]  And the police are going too far in many jurisdictions.
[00:12:02.672 --> 00:12:07.936]  They're going to end up with federal, George Soros, basically communist boards in Austin
[00:12:08.973 --> 00:12:11.995]  The review boards that oversee the police review board.
[00:12:12.035 --> 00:12:28.785]  We're doing an undercover investigation, I can now announce, because it's basically done, that is run by actual Maoists who call for arresting dissenters and ending free speech at board meetings.
[00:12:31.207 --> 00:12:37.891]  We just don't want them to know we've been there when they've been shooting their mouths off, but we got a bunch of footage to go through, shot in the last six months,
[00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.231]  It's just incredible.
[00:12:44.892 --> 00:12:53.677]  So that's why the Feds and the Globalists have given the police all this rope to hang themselves, and the police in many areas are doing a very good job of doing it.
[00:12:55.158 --> 00:12:58.560]  In Austin, the police have been a model department compared to many departments.
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.921]  I don't say that because I live here.
[00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:00.682]  It's just a fact.
[00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:01.902]  I've lived in other places.
[00:13:01.962 --> 00:13:03.223]  I've traveled a lot.
[00:13:03.323 --> 00:13:04.264]  Austin police are
[00:13:05.905 --> 00:13:08.488]  A breath of fresh air compared to other major cities that I've been in.
[00:13:08.508 --> 00:13:10.350]  I mean, I've seen some thug cops.
[00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.711]  I've run into some real criminals.
[00:13:12.112 --> 00:13:13.614]  I've seen some really bad people.
[00:13:14.454 --> 00:13:21.122]  And I've lived in Austin for 25 years and I can say, as big of a department as it is, it's a good department.
[00:13:22.463 --> 00:13:24.505]  But still, they're under a police review board.
[00:13:25.885 --> 00:13:36.111]  And they've got other boards that oversee that board, and it is a collection of people that pull the strings on the Black Lives Matter, Kill the Cops movement.
[00:13:36.952 --> 00:13:50.239]  And when you go, and almost everyone on the stage, when you research them, is a hardcore communist, and then they start shooting their mouths off in front of your camera, in front of our investigators' cameras.
[00:13:53.101 --> 00:13:54.162]  You just can't believe it.
[00:13:55.558 --> 00:14:08.408]  And we began investigating them because of the communist movements here in Austin that are getting bigger and bigger, and the UT professors that are behind it, and the Ford Foundation and others, and then our demonstrations at pro-life facilities being attacked by communists.
[00:14:09.009 --> 00:14:18.056]  We tracked these people back and then were contacted, let's just say, by people inside government.
[00:14:19.417 --> 00:14:24.979]  Who might not like the Black Lives Matter movement saying, you might want to look into these people.
[00:14:25.159 --> 00:14:29.681]  And we did, and they're actual revolutionary communists.
[00:14:29.701 --> 00:14:41.226]  I mean, do you have any idea how much trouble this country's in when the groups oversight, running oversight of the police, want a violent revolution?
[00:14:42.526 --> 00:14:44.187]  That's why they stir everything up.
[00:14:45.171 --> 00:14:51.095]  While giving police training and putting police policies in place that will create citizen anger.
[00:14:52.155 --> 00:14:54.216]  They are setting everybody up for a fall.
[00:14:54.617 --> 00:15:01.981]  It's diabolical and the police need to get wise to it right now and not be like the NYPD Union President Patrick Lynch.
[00:15:02.501 --> 00:15:03.822]  I mean, I've been in New York a lot.
[00:15:04.002 --> 00:15:06.604]  I've seen arrogant police and the New York police
[00:15:07.944 --> 00:15:10.226]  As a whole, I'm not saying they're bad people.
[00:15:10.246 --> 00:15:12.047]  A lot of great cops up there, a lot of listeners.
[00:15:12.628 --> 00:15:31.362]  But when it comes to arrogant behavior, sloppy uniforms, smoking cigars and cigarettes while riding people tickets, telling tourists they're pieces of crap, acting like gang member thugs, New York takes the cake.
[00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:34.405]  But, I'm digressing.
[00:15:34.905 --> 00:15:35.866]  It's shameful.
[00:15:37.435 --> 00:15:38.376]  It's shameful.
[00:15:42.459 --> 00:15:43.559]  It's ridiculous.
[00:15:45.721 --> 00:15:51.985]  Continuing, school district hires private investigators to catch kids stealing education.
[00:15:52.525 --> 00:15:56.028]  It's a problem that every school district has if you're a good town.
[00:15:57.844 --> 00:16:05.571]  That is catching people that don't actually live in the town with the high property taxes, or the school district, coming in to try to get their child a good education.
[00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:06.432]  Because I hear you.
[00:16:06.692 --> 00:16:14.739]  You live in a bad neighborhood, the school is like a war zone, and you don't have the money to live in the fancy area, but you want them to go to that good school.
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.963]  And if I was one of these people, I don't blame them trying to do this.
[00:16:22.025 --> 00:16:24.547]  And so, let's say grandma lives in the good district,
[00:16:25.379 --> 00:16:29.803]  But you don't, and so your daughter, you claim, lives with grandma.
[00:16:31.285 --> 00:16:33.227]  They'll go to social services and say, why?
[00:16:37.881 --> 00:16:40.644]  Are you living with your grandmother when you're supposed to live with your mother and your father?
[00:16:41.124 --> 00:16:42.405]  We're just going to take your kid away.
[00:16:42.886 --> 00:16:43.586]  Really nasty.
[00:16:43.666 --> 00:16:50.152]  But it's all based on a fraud to begin with because why do we have property taxes the last hundred years?
[00:16:50.673 --> 00:16:51.974]  We had great education before.
[00:16:52.594 --> 00:16:53.495]  We had property tax.
[00:16:53.995 --> 00:17:01.903]  That's a huge tax on people that redistributes wealth from folks that don't even have kids to pay for schools in the area.
[00:17:02.722 --> 00:17:08.526]  And then it becomes a giant boondoggle, and the more money you throw at education, the more the price of education goes up.
[00:17:10.648 --> 00:17:14.531]  So that's just miscellaneous, the type of articles.
[00:17:14.571 --> 00:17:16.792]  There's hundreds of them here that I have today.
[00:17:18.213 --> 00:17:26.379]  Obviously, we're in the 25th hour now of the 28-hour broadcast that kicked off yesterday at 11 a.m.
[00:17:26.419 --> 00:17:26.760]  Central.
[00:17:28.121 --> 00:17:28.941]  It's a big deal.
[00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:30.703]  It's important.
[00:17:31.414 --> 00:17:40.838]  That Infowars and the Nightly News and this syndicated radio show slash TV transmission go on UHF, VHF and cable stations around the country.
[00:17:42.299 --> 00:17:52.604]  If we really want to change the world, if we really want to have an effect, we have to have
[00:17:54.284 --> 00:18:06.892]  A nightly news program that goes to all of North America and then down the road to South America, to Africa, to Europe, to Asia, to the Middle East.
[00:18:08.033 --> 00:18:18.220]  And we're now on a satellite listed at infowars.com forward slash affiliates that covers from the bottom of Central America all the way up to Northern Canada.
[00:18:19.241 --> 00:18:29.525]  Every UHF VHF station, every cable station, we are on the big official King Daddy satellite that the most dishes are pointed to.
[00:18:29.945 --> 00:18:36.788]  So program directors and station owners don't even have to have one of their other dishes aimed to find some weird feed.
[00:18:37.128 --> 00:18:38.549]  We're on the big enchilada.
[00:18:45.239 --> 00:18:47.381]  And so, we're just fighting as hard as we can.
[00:18:47.441 --> 00:18:48.281]  It's why we're doing it.
[00:18:48.381 --> 00:18:56.627]  It costs $400,000 plus a year for the satellites and the closed captioning, and a lot more for the cameras, the crew, and what it's going to take to do this properly.
[00:18:57.028 --> 00:19:03.032]  We need about a million dollars to be able to not have to flog the advertising and really push things hard to pay for this.
[00:19:03.513 --> 00:19:11.258]  And $560,000 something, they're just about to update the graph there that shows it, has come in.
[00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:14.280]  And the biggest money bomb we ever had brought in about $650,000.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.643]  So I guess we're going to break our record today.
[00:19:18.663 --> 00:19:20.223]  Oh, they just updated.
[00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:20.944]  It's more than I thought.
[00:19:20.964 --> 00:19:20.944]  $572,197. $572,197.
[00:19:30.649 --> 00:19:42.875]  And so we've already reached the goal for the satellite to close captioning and have over $170,000 towards crew, towards travel, towards camera folks, towards editing, towards research, towards reporters.
[00:19:43.256 --> 00:19:47.338]  So I want to salute and thank everyone who has donated to the 2015 War Chest for Liberty.
[00:19:49.799 --> 00:20:08.351]  We want to thank you because nowhere else can you see where supporting a broadcast gets you that much bang for the buck defending every basic human freedom and we believe not just North America but the rest of the world needs to hear this message and stations all over the planet are ready to pick this up so in phase two of this
[00:20:08.891 --> 00:20:10.552]  We intend to go into Europe and more.
[00:20:11.172 --> 00:20:15.393]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[00:20:15.593 --> 00:20:19.475]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:23.856]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[00:20:26.997 --> 00:20:32.039]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[00:20:32.239 --> 00:20:40.743]  If you want to boost your Omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:25.151]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:30.052]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[00:22:30.332 --> 00:22:33.573]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.
[00:22:33.853 --> 00:22:35.933]  But there's a better way to protect your home.

[00:23:10.216 --> 00:23:11.117]  Hey, Berkey Guy here.
[00:23:11.197 --> 00:23:12.898]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[00:23:13.038 --> 00:23:14.719]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:16.620]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:22.623]  The Berkey Guy is here to help you remove these and other potential contaminants from your water, thus helping you drink clean, purified water.

[00:23:26.385 --> 00:23:28.326]  Don't go another moment without a Berkey system.
[00:23:28.366 --> 00:23:31.368]  Over the last 10 years, we've helped thousands drink clean, purified water.
[00:23:31.468 --> 00:23:34.710]  Join them by visiting GoBerkey.com or call me, the Berkey Guy, at 877-886-3653.
[00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:34.910]  That's 877-886-3653.
[00:23:39.893 --> 00:23:40.513]  I think so.
[00:24:18.127 --> 00:24:27.871]  By the way, we have a lot of really cool things that we're auctioning off to raise money to syndicate onto television this multimedia transmission.
[00:24:29.952 --> 00:24:32.193]  We've got signed .50 caliber rounds.
[00:24:33.194 --> 00:24:36.595]  We've got original artwork, little doodle drawings I've done.
[00:24:36.956 --> 00:24:39.737]  We've got a Jimmy Vaughn autographed Fender guitar.
[00:24:40.297 --> 00:24:41.798]  That closes in 40 minutes.
[00:24:42.818 --> 00:24:46.280]  A lot of these are ending within the hour.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.561]  Some of them have hundreds of bids.
[00:24:48.581 --> 00:24:51.662]  Some of them only have 20 or 30 bids or 19 bids.
[00:24:52.342 --> 00:24:59.346]  We've got an Infowars Nightly News microphone that's been used for three years out in the field and beat to hell.
[00:25:00.206 --> 00:25:08.070]  We've got the cord that the communist devil worshippers attacked when they ripped the microphone away from me, a piece of history.
[00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:12.692]  And it just makes it a sick joke on them that we raise money on their destruction.
[00:25:14.147 --> 00:25:14.627]  That's right.
[00:25:14.968 --> 00:25:21.952]  It's the microphone separately that was attacked, being auctioned off, and that was being used for many years, and also the cords.
[00:25:22.152 --> 00:25:23.513]  So obviously neither one works.
[00:25:23.553 --> 00:25:25.714]  They were attacked by communist devil worshippers on video.
[00:25:25.734 --> 00:25:30.757]  I mean, that's what comes out from under rocks when they're not off at their anti-police events.
[00:25:32.998 --> 00:25:34.719]  Ah, the destroyed mic is from Ferguson.
[00:25:35.219 --> 00:25:42.584]  So many destroyed mics when we're getting shot by the insane police on the other side, told to target the journalists that have done nothing.
[00:25:43.379 --> 00:25:44.100]  So, excuse me.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:57.749]  We're going to cover all of this coming up, but InfoWars.com forward slash Moneybomb, or you can't miss the big red link at the top of InfoWars.com, live video feed, 28 hours.
[00:25:58.349 --> 00:26:09.097]  You just click on that, you can find a live video feed, you can send that feed to friends and family, you can click through to the Moneybomb page and see the donations as they come in digitally.
[00:26:09.577 --> 00:26:12.660]  Or folks can call toll-free and donate over the phone.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:13.501]  It's 888-253-3139.
[00:26:14.241 --> 00:26:18.365]  I'm not going to cover the debate to the next segment.
[00:26:18.425 --> 00:26:19.426]  That's an 18-minute segment.
[00:26:19.446 --> 00:26:21.828]  I can really play a whole bunch of the clips from it.
[00:26:22.409 --> 00:26:23.069]  That's coming up.
[00:26:23.129 --> 00:26:26.512]  Senator Cruz says Planned Parenthood a criminal enterprise.
[00:26:27.333 --> 00:26:28.954]  One of the best statements of the night.
[00:26:29.674 --> 00:26:31.175]  Big props to Senator Cruz.
[00:26:31.776 --> 00:26:34.397]  Bush says 40 years ago he smoked marijuana.
[00:26:34.857 --> 00:26:35.458]  I admit it.
[00:26:35.618 --> 00:26:36.438]  Ooh, big deal.
[00:26:36.778 --> 00:26:38.959]  You mean 40 years ago your family shipped cocaine in.
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.180]  That'd be a bigger admission.
[00:26:41.301 --> 00:26:44.943]  Donald Trump says Rand Paul shouldn't be on the stage.
[00:26:45.363 --> 00:26:46.203]  And he's ugly.
[00:26:48.084 --> 00:26:51.206]  Trump, you look pretty goofy to me.
[00:26:52.127 --> 00:26:52.827]  I mean, I'll say it.
[00:26:52.867 --> 00:26:54.108]  Rand Paul's got curly hair.
[00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:59.492]  Which I don't think looks goofy, but I guess you could say it looks goofy from your perspective.
[00:26:59.872 --> 00:27:05.795]  You look like you have a dead blonde possum on your head, and it used to be brown.
[00:27:06.396 --> 00:27:09.877]  Then it was chimpanzee colored, and now it's blonde.
[00:27:11.198 --> 00:27:14.500]  So you get your hair bleached, Trump, to then turn it blonde.
[00:27:15.256 --> 00:27:17.258]  So if anybody looks like a freak, it's you.
[00:27:17.838 --> 00:27:27.266]  And I'm not up here attacking him, but he can't sit there and make comments about how people look and then not expect to have it thrown back at him.
[00:27:28.487 --> 00:27:30.248]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:32.650]  It's unbelievable.
[00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:34.652]  Then he goes on to say good things.
[00:27:38.755 --> 00:27:42.899]  Where he talks about the fact that this is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.
[00:27:44.827 --> 00:27:46.151]  So we're going to play all those clips.
[00:27:46.171 --> 00:27:49.421]  We got a bunch of them coming up in the next segment.
[00:27:50.203 --> 00:27:51.988]  But briefly, because I was breaking this down...
[00:27:54.278 --> 00:27:59.420]  I want to thank all of you that have donated so far to the InfoWars Money Bomb, the war chest.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:08.223]  It helps push us over the edge, it helps us take that step to be able to expand and to do it with some confidence.
[00:28:09.023 --> 00:28:16.766]  Quite frankly, a million dollars doesn't give us a lot of confidence because I could easily get in a situation and I don't want to do it, so knock on wood,
[00:28:17.426 --> 00:28:28.477]  Where the economy really implodes and things happen where I could have to sell my house to keep this place running three, four months, where I'd have to do fundraisers every week.
[00:28:28.797 --> 00:28:35.985]  We're not anywhere near that, but the economy is so bad globally and the signs are deterioration.
[00:28:37.546 --> 00:28:38.086]  It's a no-brainer.
[00:28:38.126 --> 00:28:41.648]  And there's never been a better time to be involved.
[00:28:59.312 --> 00:29:10.635]  I got a great call this morning from the manufacturing laboratory in Arizona that produces a survival shield, Nacin Ion X2, our overall bestseller, the good halogen.
[00:29:12.135 --> 00:29:18.017]  We were offering 20% off on that yesterday, and it sold out.
[00:29:18.037 --> 00:29:26.339]  We weren't going to have more in for two weeks, but 10,000 bottles are being labeled
[00:29:27.287 --> 00:29:29.576]  We're scheduled to be labeled in the next few days.
[00:29:31.354 --> 00:29:34.555]  And I got a call by our manufacturer this morning at 8 a.m.
[00:29:34.575 --> 00:29:39.096]  saying I was watching the Money Bomb and heard early this morning you've sold out of Survival Shield Nacin Iodine.
[00:29:39.556 --> 00:29:42.317]  We're gonna rush the whole factory to just package yours.
[00:29:42.997 --> 00:29:47.458]  We'll have it shipped by tomorrow so you can go ahead and just say it's in stock, a limited amount.
[00:29:47.879 --> 00:29:53.280]  So, it's discounted, it's a limited amount, then it will be a few weeks or maybe longer until we get it in.
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:58.402]  If you want Survival Shield Nacin Iodine X2, half the proceeds go to the Money Bomb.
[00:29:58.442 --> 00:29:59.942]  That is, the profit goes to the Money Bomb.
[00:30:00.262 --> 00:30:03.248]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:06.875]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.002 --> 00:30:13.123]  Kit Daniels, Infowars.com.
[00:30:13.663 --> 00:30:18.125]  President Obama has ordered the federal government to start conducting behavior experiments on U.S.
[00:30:18.165 --> 00:30:18.625]  citizens.
[00:30:18.966 --> 00:30:19.786]  You heard that right.
[00:30:20.206 --> 00:30:29.010]  The new executive order commands federal agencies to condition people into doing whatever the government wants them to do, effectively turning we the people into lab rats running through a maze for a piece of cheese.
[00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:39.295]  The feds are going to start hiring so-called behavioral scientists to encourage, meaning brainwash, people into, say, signing up for Obamacare or even turning into their guns at a local gun buyback program.
[00:30:40.015 --> 00:30:44.838]  So basically, the Obama administration wants to take the freedom of choice away from the individual and give it to the government.
[00:30:45.298 --> 00:30:46.979]  That doesn't sound like freedom now, does it?
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:52.943]  Freedom is the right of the people to choose how to live their lives as long as their conduct doesn't infringe on the rights of others to do the same.
[00:30:53.403 --> 00:30:57.426]  The Obama administration, however, wants to brainwash you into surrendering that basic liberty.
[00:30:57.846 --> 00:31:00.708]  They want you to be a lemming who jumps off the cliff when they say jump.
[00:31:01.068 --> 00:31:03.249]  But you have the power to decide not to be a slave.
[00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.852]  For more reports, check out InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:32:10.535 --> 00:32:11.817]  It's now more clear than ever.
[00:32:12.017 --> 00:32:15.622]  The Globalists have launched a planetary destabilization plan.
[00:32:15.843 --> 00:32:19.468]  Here at the Infowars operation, we hope and pray that this is not the case.
[00:32:19.728 --> 00:32:23.553]  But the signs of things deteriorating around the world are unmistakable.
[00:32:23.754 --> 00:32:26.137]  For many years, I've been working with my Patriot supply.
[00:32:26.377 --> 00:32:30.322]  And we have now developed a private label called InfoWars Select.
[00:32:30.523 --> 00:32:35.289]  Look, it's important to have firearms and water filtration during a collapse, but you've also got to have food.

[00:33:19.705 --> 00:33:21.246]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:21.346 --> 00:33:23.266]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:47.729 --> 00:33:53.952]  That's right, Europe, move over you wimps, you politically correct pansies.
[00:33:53.972 --> 00:33:59.313]  We're going to move in 10 million radical Islamists in the next few years and they're going to run the show.
[00:33:59.333 --> 00:34:05.316]  We already brought 50 million in the last few years and now you're going to adopt their ways.
[00:34:05.336 --> 00:34:11.118]  You're going to do what you're told and shut up or police in black uniforms and ski masks are going to come kick your teeth in.
[00:34:11.558 --> 00:34:12.098]  And guess what?
[00:34:12.118 --> 00:34:14.599]  We're reauthorizing and reconvening
[00:34:15.785 --> 00:34:25.942]  The Stasi, Germany-wide this time, and they're going to give you 120 days in jail and or a 5,000 euro fine if you criticize any of the open borders.
[00:34:27.455 --> 00:34:46.082]  And if you try to convene in a public place, even a mainline nationalist organization or conservative group, led by members of the Bundestag, the Congress, the Reichstag, we're going to have riot police shoot you with rubber bullets and beat you over the head with clubs, because Europe's so free.
[00:34:48.503 --> 00:34:50.564]  And it's the same thing for Spain.
[00:34:52.591 --> 00:34:58.797]  And now here our borders are wide open, and the Border Patrol's job is, quote, completing the smuggling process.
[00:34:59.798 --> 00:35:04.002]  We just randomly go to the border and catch massive drug shipments being brought in.
[00:35:05.143 --> 00:35:05.523]  U.S.
[00:35:05.643 --> 00:35:14.831]  Repeals Propaganda Ban Spreads Government-Made News to Americans, Foreign Policy Journal of the Washington Post.
[00:35:15.732 --> 00:35:17.194]  Remember that back in 2013?
[00:35:20.532 --> 00:35:22.052]  And then this came out yesterday.
[00:35:22.192 --> 00:35:24.773]  Obama issues Orwellian executive order.
[00:35:26.213 --> 00:35:35.396]  Federal agencies have been directed to hire psychologists and experiment and find ways to better manipulate, it actually says that, the American people to the federal government's will.
[00:35:35.636 --> 00:35:36.716]  That's already going on.
[00:35:37.076 --> 00:35:40.177]  They're just now making it very naked.
[00:35:40.317 --> 00:35:41.177]  Key word I use.
[00:35:41.617 --> 00:35:45.098]  I have a big vocabulary, but naked is a word we use a lot.
[00:35:45.979 --> 00:35:47.000]  It means it's not hidden.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:58.327]  World government, world taxes, your children not belonging to you, no private property, paramilitary death squads, re-education camps, army.mil.
[00:35:59.848 --> 00:36:06.011]  Re-education camps for libertarians, gun owners, and veterans is public.
[00:36:06.372 --> 00:36:08.133]  They admit we're the enemy in the manuals.
[00:36:08.633 --> 00:36:12.175]  They admit that they're prepared to reprocess us through camps.
[00:36:12.515 --> 00:36:14.517]  They call it re-education camps.
[00:36:15.322 --> 00:36:17.784]  They call it domestic propaganda.
[00:36:18.044 --> 00:36:19.625]  They call it brainwashing.
[00:36:20.185 --> 00:36:27.750]  I can play the former Attorney General to the RTF National Convention saying, I want you to literally brainwash the public.
[00:36:30.311 --> 00:36:31.932]  Literally brainwash.
[00:36:32.192 --> 00:36:36.215]  When they call your kids in and say, do any of you feel like you're a boy or a girl?
[00:36:36.235 --> 00:36:38.076]  Because girls can go in the boys' bathroom.
[00:36:39.625 --> 00:36:42.186]  And girls can go in the boys bathroom and vice versa.
[00:36:42.487 --> 00:36:43.687]  So if you're a boy, you can go in the girls.
[00:36:43.707 --> 00:36:44.808]  If you're a girl, you can go in the boys.
[00:36:45.088 --> 00:36:46.128]  Or you can go anywhere you want.
[00:36:46.549 --> 00:36:50.271]  And let's have a discussion, six-year-olds, about your sexual organs.
[00:36:51.151 --> 00:36:56.594]  That is the government getting involved sexually with your children in a giant exercise of power.
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.082]  No longer is it contributing to the delinquency of minors.
[00:37:01.402 --> 00:37:02.903]  No longer is it pedophilia.
[00:37:03.283 --> 00:37:05.945]  It's the government saying, your kids belong to us.
[00:37:06.265 --> 00:37:08.467]  And by the way, we're going to forcibly inoculate them.
[00:37:08.967 --> 00:37:10.128]  And we don't care what you say.
[00:37:10.148 --> 00:37:11.909]  A SWAT team's standing by.
[00:37:15.892 --> 00:37:20.635]  And so the article just goes on from there.
[00:37:21.966 --> 00:37:40.191]  A growing body of evidence, this is from the whitehouse.gov, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that behavioral science insights, research findings from fields such as behavioral economics and psychology and how people make decisions and act on them can be used to design government policies to better serve the American people.
[00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:44.092]  That's right, let me better serve you by chopping you up and putting you on the plate.
[00:37:44.632 --> 00:37:46.392]  Obama wrote an executive order.
[00:37:46.633 --> 00:37:47.973]  When you read the executive order,
[00:37:50.086 --> 00:37:55.389]  And it breaks down how they're going to use classical psych warfare, the Pentagon, and the rest of it.
[00:37:55.409 --> 00:38:04.635]  Remember, a few years ago, we had the headline, Pentagon Promises to Stop Lying Because of Drudge?
[00:38:06.356 --> 00:38:08.577]  Very important article, very important video.
[00:38:09.197 --> 00:38:15.501]  And then under it, we have the sub-headline saying it's really the rollout of total deception and lies.
[00:38:15.741 --> 00:38:16.642]  That's how a lie works.
[00:38:17.904 --> 00:38:19.244]  I'm not here to assault you.
[00:38:19.424 --> 00:38:19.784]  Boom!
[00:38:19.944 --> 00:38:20.645]  I break your nose.
[00:38:21.205 --> 00:38:21.765]  I'm sorry.
[00:38:22.065 --> 00:38:22.925]  Don't get up, sir.
[00:38:23.085 --> 00:38:24.025]  I'm sorry that happened.
[00:38:24.385 --> 00:38:25.166]  I apologize.
[00:38:25.366 --> 00:38:26.226]  I knee you in the throat.
[00:38:26.246 --> 00:38:27.546]  You die.
[00:38:29.066 --> 00:38:32.807]  That's actually a psych warfare technique that commandos and people are taught.
[00:38:33.407 --> 00:38:34.607]  Oh, this is not an assault.
[00:38:35.068 --> 00:38:35.688]  Break your nose.
[00:38:36.108 --> 00:38:37.528]  I didn't mean this to happen.
[00:38:37.708 --> 00:38:38.668]  So you don't even fight back.
[00:38:40.169 --> 00:38:42.149]  This is not an assault, just like Waco.
[00:38:42.989 --> 00:38:43.529]  The whole thing.
[00:38:43.609 --> 00:38:44.289]  Break your neck.
[00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:45.570]  This is not an assault.
[00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:46.810]  We're not coming for you.
[00:38:47.895 --> 00:38:54.038]  Because your brain takes that message and starts thinking, are they telling the truth, instead of acting and defending yourself.
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.722]  I'm really sorry this hurts, jam a dagger right in the back of your neck.
[00:39:01.922 --> 00:39:02.463]  I love you!
[00:39:02.763 --> 00:39:04.044]  I love you!
[00:39:04.124 --> 00:39:04.944]  Have some fluoride!
[00:39:05.104 --> 00:39:05.825]  Have some vaccines!
[00:39:06.505 --> 00:39:07.145]  We love your kids!
[00:39:07.926 --> 00:39:08.946]  We're gonna take care of you!
[00:39:12.088 --> 00:39:13.969]  And it's all a sick joke to them.
[00:39:16.715 --> 00:39:17.915]  Let's try to pull that headline up.
[00:39:18.396 --> 00:39:21.196]  Pentagon promises to stop lying because of drudge.
[00:39:22.337 --> 00:39:25.298]  Government promises to stop lying because of drudge report spotlight.
[00:39:26.538 --> 00:39:31.640]  But then you actually go to the video from the Undersecretary of Defense.
[00:39:32.645 --> 00:39:43.159]  The deputy, and it's a video where he admits we've been lying, the people don't trust us, so now we're going to operate domestically with every police department, every newspaper, every TV station.
[00:39:43.559 --> 00:39:48.205]  We're going to pay them money, and we're going to teach them that we're here to love you, and we're going to stop lying.
[00:39:48.866 --> 00:39:55.473]  And most people, the officers, the civilians, the non-commissioned officers, look completely freaked out.
[00:39:55.793 --> 00:39:57.915]  They look like they've been put in front of a firing squad.
[00:39:58.256 --> 00:40:07.104]  They know that this is total open evil, that they're launching a domestic takeover, saying we promise to tell the truth, we come in peace, drop your firearms.
[00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:09.105]  Don't shoot, we are your friends.
[00:40:09.645 --> 00:40:18.588]  And then they get some of these PR people up who mean well to ask questions and they start crying and going, you mean I'm not going to have to lie anymore because I hate lying?
[00:40:18.808 --> 00:40:21.488]  They go, man, Sergeant, you're done talking now.
[00:40:21.728 --> 00:40:22.869]  We need someone else up here.
[00:40:23.169 --> 00:40:24.309]  People are shaking their heads.
[00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:28.030]  People have tears in their eyes because it's so sick.
[00:40:30.899 --> 00:40:44.301]  Because they're not evil, they don't like being part of this, they don't like saying we're fighting ISIS when they've got resupply, C-130s landing, delivering them weapons on the hour, in battle with Russian commandos, who are on the right side.
[00:40:45.241 --> 00:40:54.943]  You think America, the actual military, likes being clearly on the bad side, with Al-Qaeda, launching wars, and then back home, we gotta take your rights away because of Al-Qaeda.
[00:40:55.523 --> 00:40:59.644]  Do you think anybody in the government likes being part of that?
[00:41:02.895 --> 00:41:04.195]  But the people on top do.
[00:41:06.436 --> 00:41:07.916]  So that all ties together.
[00:41:07.936 --> 00:41:11.697]  We ought to do a new report about that for the nightly news in the next few days.
[00:41:11.717 --> 00:41:26.319]  And for her on the radio, looking back to the Pentagon promising to stop lying by getting involved in every local paper and TV station.
[00:41:26.659 --> 00:41:31.260]  Hi, we're the Pentagon with all these psychiatrists and experts here to help you.
[00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.873]  But it's a Pentagon run by offshore banks in the takeover of America.
[00:41:37.153 --> 00:41:58.210]  Just like in Europe, they've hired the Stasi, the former East German, most hardcore, vicious, hateful communist you can imagine, to get on the news and say, if you say anything bad about these wonderful migrants, if you not call them migrants, if you call them invaders, we will have you arrested.
[00:42:00.868 --> 00:42:04.129]  And the woman commanding it all looks like a female Ronald McDonald.
[00:42:06.849 --> 00:42:10.510]  I mean, this is the bozo, the clown level garbage, and we'll all bow to her.
[00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:11.490]  We'll do whatever she says.
[00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:12.290]  This is America.
[00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:12.950]  This is Europe.
[00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:14.430]  This is the land of cowards.
[00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:15.791]  We're here to be usurped.
[00:42:16.111 --> 00:42:18.431]  And I say that so maybe we'll stop being cowards.
[00:42:19.811 --> 00:42:22.472]  I don't care what any two-bit Pentagon propaganda says.
[00:42:22.552 --> 00:42:23.932]  I don't care what Media Matters says.
[00:42:24.232 --> 00:42:25.512]  I don't care what the White House does.
[00:42:25.572 --> 00:42:26.712]  I don't care what the Stasi does.
[00:42:27.212 --> 00:42:30.073]  We're not shutting up, and the real Americans are coming.
[00:42:31.257 --> 00:42:50.328]  Because the next thing, the next place I'm going to beam our message into, when phase one becomes operational, we're on right now, but it'll be operational when it becomes self-funding in the next six months, I intend to blast all of Western and Eastern Europe with a free-to-air satellite with five hours of this transmission a day.
[00:42:51.468 --> 00:42:54.650]  And as soon as we have enough capital, we're going to refeed it 24 hours a day, worldwide.
[00:42:58.405 --> 00:43:05.202]  And then our operatives, who don't even work for us but love liberty, who are directed by freedom, who are directed by truth and justice.
[00:43:07.298 --> 00:43:09.699]  No communications, other than the fact they know what's happening.
[00:43:10.019 --> 00:43:17.703]  They're going to spread the word and get us on local TV channels and cable channels in Europe that actually aren't controlled.
[00:43:18.063 --> 00:43:29.568]  The globalists use political correctness in Europe to get their message saturated, but there's a new phenomenon all over the Netherlands, Germany, and other places where anti-New World Order information is now being aired.
[00:43:30.373 --> 00:43:40.302]  And we already have the contacts all over Europe, from France to the Netherlands, from Germany to Italy, with a lot of folks with UHF VHF Pirate that's huge in Italy.
[00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:43.131]  And other areas ready to turn us on.
[00:43:43.471 --> 00:43:44.151]  We're coming.
[00:43:44.411 --> 00:43:45.912]  The real voice of America.
[00:43:46.172 --> 00:43:51.373]  And quite frankly, I wasn't going to roll this out until later, but we're going to bill it as the real voice of America.
[00:43:51.733 --> 00:43:54.234]  You want to hear the voice of America directly from Texas?
[00:43:55.134 --> 00:43:59.376]  The real deal that the world loved, that people stood up for, that people admired?
[00:43:59.696 --> 00:44:03.237]  Free market, rugged individualism, Second Amendment.
[00:44:04.197 --> 00:44:09.079]  We're sorry the globalists captured America and used us to enslave you even more, but we're coming.
[00:44:09.827 --> 00:44:11.709]  The Yankees are coming, baby.
[00:44:12.129 --> 00:44:12.750]  We're coming.
[00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:14.131]  That's what all this is about.
[00:44:14.291 --> 00:44:14.951]  We're coming.
[00:44:16.893 --> 00:44:18.895]  Nobody will watch American news now in Europe.
[00:44:18.955 --> 00:44:19.395]  It's dead.
[00:44:19.435 --> 00:44:20.316]  Its ratings are over.
[00:44:20.997 --> 00:44:24.039]  So a lot of foreign transmissions of U.S.
[00:44:24.099 --> 00:44:25.681]  news are basically being phased out.
[00:44:27.244 --> 00:44:34.049]  But that's because they only care about making money or getting their propaganda out, so if no one's listening and they're not making money, they're ending their transmissions.
[00:44:34.389 --> 00:44:35.490]  We don't care about the money.
[00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:44.616]  If we can just pay the bills, that's the mission, is to transmit into those cities, into those countries, into that continent.
[00:44:44.877 --> 00:44:49.420]  And then to hit the Middle East, and to hit Africa, and to hit Latin America, and to hit Asia.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.521]  We'll hit it all!
[00:44:51.181 --> 00:44:52.041]  But it's up to you!
[00:44:52.601 --> 00:44:53.161]  We're coming!
[00:44:53.221 --> 00:44:54.162]  We're not playing games!
[00:44:54.362 --> 00:44:57.162]  Who else is going to put Patriot Television on worldwide?
[00:44:57.422 --> 00:44:59.142]  Who else is going to fight the New World Order?
[00:44:59.382 --> 00:45:10.965]  Who else is going to tell you there's cancer viruses and the vaccines and that they're going to have CIA operatives brainwashing the local TV station people into taking over and putting out propaganda?
[00:45:11.305 --> 00:45:18.626]  We're here to counter that just in case TV station folks, UHF, VHF and others want to actually put something real on.
[00:45:19.551 --> 00:45:21.571]  There's nobody calling the shots here but the truth.
[00:45:21.972 --> 00:45:24.032]  There's nobody calling the shots here but taking action.
[00:45:24.232 --> 00:45:25.812]  I don't tell my reporters what to report.
[00:45:26.372 --> 00:45:28.793]  I don't tell my reporters most of the time even where to go.
[00:45:29.173 --> 00:45:32.574]  They're already there before me because they're Americans who love liberty.
[00:45:32.914 --> 00:45:35.814]  They're humans that love freedom and they're taking action.
[00:45:37.875 --> 00:45:48.317]  I want to get into the debate and then your phone calls but I do want to just add it takes money to do something like this and all the profits
[00:45:50.046 --> 00:45:58.791]  from the sales during this 28-hour war chest operation is going into the Money Bomb.

[00:46:41.807 --> 00:46:42.547]  We're willing
[00:46:44.537 --> 00:46:54.199]  To produce the news, to do the research, to tell the truth, to put our necks out there, to put our heads up, to warn people as Paul Revere worldwide, 1776 worldwide.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:58.881]  I want to ask you, what are you willing to do in this time in history?
[00:46:59.221 --> 00:47:06.162]  When folks ask you, when your grandchildren ask you, or your children ask you, or your neighbors ask you, where were you during the takeover?
[00:47:06.522 --> 00:47:08.043]  What did you do to try to stop it?
[00:47:11.104 --> 00:47:12.624]  Don't lose faith, understand that
[00:47:14.022 --> 00:47:16.463]  We forced Chris Christie to backpedal on vaccines.
[00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:21.226]  We forced Dr. Carson to backpedal on vaccines.
[00:47:21.927 --> 00:47:24.668]  We forced Donald Trump to backpedal on vaccines.
[00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:27.310]  We forced many people.
[00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:31.252]  To backpedal up there trying to push forced inoculations.
[00:47:31.572 --> 00:47:37.737]  And so last night we heard Rand Paul saying, you know, there's some good vaccines out there, but I'm all for freedom and the right to say no.
[00:47:38.358 --> 00:47:44.242]  You had Donald Trump going further saying, hey, vaccines are actually hurting people I know.
[00:47:44.582 --> 00:47:45.263]  That was bold.
[00:47:45.523 --> 00:47:51.668]  So he's under attack in the Washington Post today for daring to talk about the elephant in the room.
[00:47:53.697 --> 00:47:58.579]  So let's go ahead and start off with some of the highlights of the debate with Donald Trump on vaccines.
[00:48:03.781 --> 00:48:09.443]  Hey, let's go to what they're saying right now because Donald Trump is making an epic statement about the connection of autism and vaccines.
[00:48:09.683 --> 00:48:16.866]  And I've seen it and I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time, same exact amount.
[00:48:17.166 --> 00:48:20.147]  But you take this little beautiful baby and you pump
[00:48:21.007 --> 00:48:24.509]  I mean, it looks just like it's meant for a horse, not for a child.
[00:48:24.909 --> 00:48:38.817]  And we've had so many instances, people that worked for me just the other day, two years old, two and a half years old, a child, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick.
[00:48:38.997 --> 00:48:39.437]  This is great.
[00:48:39.457 --> 00:48:40.798]  He's doing a great job.
[00:48:40.898 --> 00:48:43.559]  I only say, I'm in favor of vaccines.
[00:48:43.599 --> 00:48:43.959]  Same amount.
[00:48:47.541 --> 00:48:49.202]  Just in, in little sections.
[00:48:49.382 --> 00:48:51.423]  And that's what I said earlier, I agree on that.
[00:48:51.483 --> 00:48:52.584]  Excellent, excellent.
[00:48:52.604 --> 00:48:55.826]  I think you're going to see a big impact on autism.
[00:48:56.086 --> 00:48:58.548]  Dr. Carson, nailed it.
[00:48:58.668 --> 00:49:00.669]  Good job, he didn't backtrack, I like that.
[00:49:00.689 --> 00:49:01.129]  That's right.
[00:49:01.169 --> 00:49:02.130]  He's an okay doctor.
[00:49:06.252 --> 00:49:07.913]  Oh yeah, trust me because I'm a doctor.
[00:49:07.953 --> 00:49:09.014]  Come on, I don't want to hear that.
[00:49:10.034 --> 00:49:12.696]  I can read the stuff myself, Dr. Ben Carson.
[00:49:13.456 --> 00:49:15.878]  Read the Constitution, jerk, if you're going to run for president.
[00:49:16.584 --> 00:49:19.085]  There's no autism associated with vaccinations.
[00:49:19.585 --> 00:49:24.307]  But it is true that- Documented proof by our paid off scientists.
[00:49:24.327 --> 00:49:26.768]  Paid off by- Let's stop right there.
[00:49:26.908 --> 00:49:27.988]  Now recognize that.
[00:49:28.628 --> 00:49:35.451]  The full video of our live commentary over it is at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com
[00:49:37.253 --> 00:49:42.715]  But notice Carson then goes on to backtrack more and admits, yeah, we give them too many at one time.
[00:49:43.155 --> 00:49:45.696]  But he lies and says there's no link to autism.
[00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:48.217]  Those fake studies have been overturned.
[00:49:49.097 --> 00:49:55.640]  The doctor who did the study with the other doctors has been exonerated in England.
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:59.281]  That his study showing it was linked to autism was indeed true.
[00:49:59.581 --> 00:50:00.722]  He won a lawsuit over that.
[00:50:00.982 --> 00:50:01.682]  It was all a fraud.
[00:50:02.534 --> 00:50:04.935]  They're gonna have studies out saying Roundup's good for you, folks.
[00:50:05.275 --> 00:50:07.276]  We've got hundreds of studies showing it gives you cancer.
[00:50:08.417 --> 00:50:10.238]  Hell, they're gonna tell you a bullet in the head's good next.
[00:50:10.638 --> 00:50:23.285]  But I gotta say, as a litmus test, Donald Trump coming out against vaccines and saying, I got a lot of friends and family who've got brain-damaged kids from this, shows that he really cares about people.
[00:50:24.372 --> 00:50:28.074]  And he knows the system's going to come after him, and he understands what's going on.
[00:50:28.154 --> 00:50:32.817]  And when the rubber meets the road, he doesn't want to be involved in brain damaging tens of millions of children.
[00:50:34.438 --> 00:50:40.402]  It is a fact that vaccines are linked to increased cancer, neurological disorders, autoimmune disorders.
[00:50:40.722 --> 00:50:42.664]  It says it on the stinking inserts.
[00:50:43.284 --> 00:50:50.769]  And Ben Carson, a medical doctor, a brain surgeon, not an epidemiologist, not a virologist,
[00:50:51.857 --> 00:50:58.421]  He just sits there and says it's wonderful because he's a good guy as a doctor, so he believes everything they're doing must be wonderful.
[00:50:59.722 --> 00:51:03.065]  Carson, they've recalled hundreds of vaccines for killing people before.
[00:51:03.625 --> 00:51:04.205]  You know that.
[00:51:04.666 --> 00:51:07.928]  So, you really lose everybody at that point.

[00:54:32.157 --> 00:54:35.759]  We should have heard more about states' rights being the answer last night.
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:41.663]  We should have heard more about it's not the federal government's job to make sure America's quote successful.
[00:54:44.424 --> 00:54:58.713]  But we did hear some really good points from people like Senator Rand Paul about the fact that with this whole illegal alien immigrant invasion problem, why isn't Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries taking a single person?
[00:54:59.721 --> 00:55:02.042]  When they're the ones destabilizing the whole region.
[00:55:03.583 --> 00:55:04.644]  And that clip's coming up.
[00:55:05.064 --> 00:55:12.368]  But first, Senator Ted Cruz had this to say about Planned Parenthood being a criminal enterprise.
[00:55:12.788 --> 00:55:13.868]  And that's what you gotta do.
[00:55:13.908 --> 00:55:17.470]  Look, I've seen the vaccines hurt kids over and over again.
[00:55:18.231 --> 00:55:19.151]  It's out of control.
[00:55:19.171 --> 00:55:20.972]  We're giving them enough for a horse.
[00:55:21.532 --> 00:55:22.413]  Something's wrong.
[00:55:24.875 --> 00:55:27.537]  And then suddenly you see people like Carson start to fold.
[00:55:27.937 --> 00:55:28.778]  Start to backpedal.
[00:55:28.998 --> 00:55:30.399]  Because they know the truth.
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:32.761]  But they've been committed to this lie so long.
[00:55:33.302 --> 00:55:34.202]  Same thing with Cruz.
[00:55:34.663 --> 00:55:35.603]  Call them what they are.

[00:55:37.005 --> 00:55:38.226]  Clearly committing crimes.
[00:55:38.666 --> 00:55:40.067]  Clearly selling the body parts.
[00:55:40.567 --> 00:55:41.248]  Open and shut.
[00:55:41.588 --> 00:55:42.269]  Indict them.
[00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:43.330]  Shut them down.
[00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:46.272]  You start fighting evil folks, historically?
[00:55:47.553 --> 00:55:49.294]  It starts falling like dominoes.
[00:55:52.837 --> 00:55:53.558]  That's why
[00:55:55.694 --> 00:55:59.597]  They always try to act so confident and invincible because they're not.
[00:56:00.158 --> 00:56:01.318]  Let's go to the Ted Cruz clip.
[00:56:01.338 --> 00:56:01.679]  Here it is.
[00:56:03.117 --> 00:56:05.938]  Well, let me tell you, Dan, number one, I'm proud to stand for life.
[00:56:06.258 --> 00:56:08.279]  These Planned Parenthood videos are horrifying.
[00:56:08.299 --> 00:56:10.779]  I would encourage every American to watch these videos.
[00:56:11.539 --> 00:56:18.321]  See senior Planned Parenthood officials callously, heartlessly bartering and selling the body parts of human beings.
[00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:21.102]  And then ask yourself, are these my values?
[00:56:21.142 --> 00:56:22.223]  These are horrifying.
[00:56:22.963 --> 00:56:27.764]  On these videos, Planned Parenthood also essentially confesses to multiple felonies.
[00:56:27.804 --> 00:56:30.105]  It is a felony with 10 years jail term.
[00:56:30.825 --> 00:56:33.946]  To sell the body parts of unborn children for profit.
[00:56:33.986 --> 00:56:36.127]  That's what these videos show Planned Parenthood doing.
[00:56:36.647 --> 00:56:37.447]  Absolutely.
[00:56:37.867 --> 00:56:43.769]  We shouldn't be sending $500 million of taxpayer money to funding an ongoing criminal enterprise.
[00:56:43.789 --> 00:56:56.013]  And I'll tell you the fact that Republican leadership in both houses has begun this discussion by preemptively surrendering to Barack Obama and saying we'll give in because Obama threatens a veto.
[00:56:56.994 --> 00:57:00.097]  You know, Obama's committed to his principles, his liberal principles.
[00:57:00.418 --> 00:57:01.319]  He will fight for them.
[00:57:01.379 --> 00:57:06.644]  He says, I will veto any budget that doesn't fund Planned Parenthood and Republicans surrender.
[00:57:06.944 --> 00:57:10.348]  We need to stop surrendering and start standing for our principles.
[00:57:12.711 --> 00:57:13.311]  Absolutely.
[00:57:13.371 --> 00:57:19.598]  That's because once they get us to go along with them, because if they ever get pushed back on one thing, they fall.
[00:57:22.028 --> 00:57:23.608]  So it gets more and more outrageous.
[00:57:24.008 --> 00:57:36.811]  Now they're not in trouble for openly selling body parts for decades on a huge scale, admitting it's a cover-up, premeditated fraud, organized crime, and we can't even go after them?
[00:57:39.191 --> 00:57:42.531]  That's because if they fall on one point, they fall on every point.
[00:57:44.672 --> 00:57:51.333]  But, you start calling them criminals on national TV, you start pointing it out, you start pointing out the conspiracy, it's game over.
[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:56.603]  And I looked in Ted Cruz's eyes right there and I can see there's a good person there overall.
[00:57:57.143 --> 00:57:58.505]  Somebody who wants to do good.
[00:57:58.525 --> 00:57:59.906]  Somebody who wants to do right.
[00:58:00.206 --> 00:58:01.347]  I know that about Rand Paul.
[00:58:02.427 --> 00:58:03.588]  I know that about Ted Cruz.
[00:58:03.708 --> 00:58:17.499]  And seeing what I've seen out of Donald Trump, knowing what I know about what he's going to be going through now for saying that, and looking at the look in his eye, I guarantee you Donald Trump doesn't like seeing his friends have brain damaged kids all around him.
[00:58:19.093 --> 00:58:22.878]  It's a large portion of people have giggling, happy, 18-month-old baby boys.
[00:58:23.819 --> 00:58:25.742]  Their blood-brain barrier's not strong as a girl's.
[00:58:26.182 --> 00:58:27.945]  They going to get that last round of shots?
[00:58:28.345 --> 00:58:29.507]  Billy don't ever talk again.
[00:58:30.816 --> 00:58:32.858]  That's why a lot of members of Congress are against vaccines.
[00:58:33.999 --> 00:58:41.104]  Because, you know, you or your kid or your grandchildren take a shot and never talk again, that'll wake some people up.
[00:58:41.825 --> 00:58:42.745]  So, I gotta say it.
[00:58:43.866 --> 00:58:51.612]  Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump, they are the three presidential contenders, in my view, for a position of liberty.
[00:58:51.712 --> 00:58:57.417]  And I just can find really no way to criticize them at this point because what they're saying is so bombshell.
[00:59:00.703 --> 00:59:03.905]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:59:04.205 --> 00:59:12.230]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:17.474]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:59:17.874 --> 00:59:20.175]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:00:19.939 --> 01:00:21.040]  Government cover-ups.

[01:00:38.373 --> 01:00:39.634]  They always will just push more.
[01:00:41.513 --> 01:00:43.535]  They want to tell you what words to use, how to talk.
[01:00:44.295 --> 01:00:45.896]  Don't say boy or girl, man or woman.
[01:00:46.737 --> 01:00:48.418]  I got some words for them I can teach them.
[01:00:48.499 --> 01:00:49.479]  Go to hell.
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:51.581]  Those are elementary school words.
[01:00:51.701 --> 01:00:52.942]  G-O-T-O.
[01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:57.306]  Go G-O-T-O-H-E double hockey sticks.
[01:00:58.927 --> 01:01:02.610]  You control freak cult sickos.
[01:01:04.192 --> 01:01:14.494]  Now, I want to open the phones up in this hour about the debates last night, about the big world events, about Obama signing an executive order admitting they're going to engage in psychological warfare against the American people.
[01:01:15.835 --> 01:01:18.055]  That was legalized by Congress two years ago.
[01:01:18.895 --> 01:01:20.256]  It's been going on before that.
[01:01:21.956 --> 01:01:27.417]  Right after it was legalized, the Pentagon announced, we're going to stop lying and work with you locally to make sure it doesn't happen.
[01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:30.098]  Which is the big lie.
[01:01:32.711 --> 01:01:37.014]  I'm going to drop by and check on your house where out of town, make sure there's no robbers there.
[01:01:38.295 --> 01:01:44.540]  Well, you don't leave town and you wake up and your neighbor is walking out your front door with your wife's jewelry and your computer and you're like, Bob, where are you going?
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.582]  Oh, I'm just making sure this is all safe.
[01:01:48.883 --> 01:01:50.184]  So we're going to break all of that down.
[01:01:50.204 --> 01:01:52.786]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:01:52.806 --> 01:01:52.846]  800-259-9231.
[01:02:02.955 --> 01:02:09.457]  On another note, I went swimming last Memorial Day, or not Memorial Day, last Labor Day, last Monday.
[01:02:09.537 --> 01:02:10.717]  Not this Monday, but last Monday.
[01:02:13.298 --> 01:02:22.600]  And a couple days later, I thought that I'd been grinding my teeth again at night or something, or clenching, and was it aches so bad on the side of my head, I thought it was TMJ I've had before.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.001]  When I'm real stressed out, I'll clench and grind my teeth.
[01:02:25.781 --> 01:02:28.682]  Sometimes I wear a mouth splint, not do it.
[01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:36.289]  But it didn't go away in a couple days, even though I was wearing the mouse splint, and then my... What do you call them?
[01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:38.771]  Lymph nodes swell up on this side, on my right side.
[01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:40.972]  And I thought, well, it'll go away in a few days.
[01:02:41.052 --> 01:02:41.773]  It's an infection.
[01:02:43.094 --> 01:02:47.896]  And I drank a bunch of colloidal silver, and it kind of did go away, but then, so I stopped drinking colloidal silver after three days.
[01:02:48.577 --> 01:02:56.902]  And then, I was with the family again out at the lake, last weekend fishing and water skiing and stuff with friends that have a boat.
[01:02:58.615 --> 01:03:06.719]  I got a boat but it's really too old so I was hanging out with friends and all of a sudden I woke up in the morning and it was just blown up everywhere, both sides.
[01:03:07.259 --> 01:03:10.201]  I looked like Frankenstein, my jaw was so wide I couldn't hear.
[01:03:10.781 --> 01:03:18.225]  Got to the doctor, got me on antibiotics and it's reduced it by about 80% but I still feel like I've been run over by a Mack truck.
[01:03:18.785 --> 01:03:27.250]  And the doctor was telling me that a lot of people lose their hearing doing that because the Eustachian tubule gets so infected that all that gets pushed back into the inner ear and then you can lose hearing.
[01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:36.798]  And it was funny, the day before I went to the doctor, I was talking to a guy that was a listener, and he said he lost hearing in his ear by a bacteria he got in the lake.
[01:03:36.858 --> 01:03:40.061]  And just don't swim in the lake for at least two weeks after it rains.
[01:03:40.081 --> 01:03:44.965]  It's been raining for weeks, off and on, because all the dog crap and the rest of it washes in.
[01:03:45.666 --> 01:03:46.847]  But see, I'm not a doctor.
[01:03:47.027 --> 01:03:53.272]  I just know swimming in a hot lake at the end of a summer, it's still hot down here, is not a good idea.
[01:03:53.412 --> 01:03:54.433]  And I'm not doing it anymore.
[01:03:56.414 --> 01:04:12.567]  And I'm not a rocket scientist, but I know almost everybody I know that has a brain damaged child, it's a boy, and at 18 months they got a third round of shots and sometimes had convulsions right there in the doctor's office and then never talked again or yelled and screamed and banged their head in the wall for the rest of their life.
[01:04:13.547 --> 01:04:14.408]  Or a mix of those.
[01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:23.315]  But then I can go out to the medical research and find out why bacteria get in your throat or in your ear and get you really sick.
[01:04:24.358 --> 01:04:30.661]  I can go read the medical literature, even though I'm not a doctor, about all the hundreds of vaccines recalled in the last century.
[01:04:32.622 --> 01:04:37.184]  There's been more than 20 of them this year recalled around the world, killing people.
[01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:49.190]  So when it's too obvious, you know, you give a village of 300 people the shot and a hundred of them die, the rest of them get deathly ill, you're going to recall that vaccine.
[01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:52.612]  But when it just brain damages, you know, five or six boys,
[01:04:53.976 --> 01:04:54.937]  That's okay, see?
[01:04:55.598 --> 01:04:57.039]  Because it's meant to do that.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.263]  Most people, it's just meant to dumb you down and brain damage you some.
[01:05:00.923 --> 01:05:08.151]  But sometimes the effect's too intense, and you get a wrecked brain that doesn't make for a good biological android for working in an apple factory.
[01:05:10.828 --> 01:05:12.969]  Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:17.971]  President Obama has ordered the federal government to start conducting behavior experiments on U.S.
[01:05:17.991 --> 01:05:18.451]  citizens.
[01:05:18.811 --> 01:05:19.611]  You heard that right.
[01:05:20.031 --> 01:05:28.834]  The new executive order commands federal agencies to condition people into doing whatever the government wants them to do, effectively turning we the people into lab rats running through a maze for a piece of cheese.
[01:05:29.374 --> 01:05:39.138]  The feds are going to start hiring so-called behavioral scientists to encourage, meaning brainwash, people into, say, signing up for Obamacare or even turning into their guns at a local gun buyback program.
[01:05:39.838 --> 01:05:44.660]  So basically, the Obama administration wants to take the freedom of choice away from the individual and give it to the government.
[01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:46.821]  That doesn't sound like freedom now, does it?
[01:05:47.301 --> 01:05:52.784]  Freedom is the right of the people to choose how to live their lives as long as their conduct doesn't infringe on the rights of others to do the same.
[01:05:53.244 --> 01:05:57.266]  The Obama administration, however, wants to brainwash you into surrendering that basic liberty.
[01:05:57.686 --> 01:06:00.547]  They want you to be a lemming who jumps off the cliff when they say jump.
[01:06:00.907 --> 01:06:03.088]  But you have the power to decide not to be a slave.

[01:07:16.735 --> 01:07:19.376]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:07:19.416 --> 01:07:26.181]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:07:26.461 --> 01:07:29.303]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:07:29.443 --> 01:07:32.386]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.

[01:07:34.407 --> 01:07:37.229]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:07:37.329 --> 01:07:42.852]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:07:43.052 --> 01:07:46.535]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.

[01:08:15.903 --> 01:08:18.704]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:39.505 --> 01:08:48.110]  You know, I played this last hour, but I've got to play this again before I run through all these clips of what we think are the best highlights of the
[01:08:49.349 --> 01:09:15.263]  Pretty amazing Republican debates last night that here at Infowars.com and the Nightly News, we had two plus hours of live coverage while it was going on with our reporters cutting in, chiming in with their analysis, their punditry, their facts, their comebacks to the disinformation, but also the truth that came out during the debate.
[01:09:16.363 --> 01:09:17.084]  Donald Trump
[01:09:18.021 --> 01:09:19.382]  Coming out against vaccines.
[01:09:20.042 --> 01:09:22.764]  He really got me more in his camp with that move.
[01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:26.367]  Because that's one of the biggest attacks on humanity.
[01:09:26.807 --> 01:09:30.730]  Then we're going to get into Cruz, saying Planned Parenthood is a criminal enterprise.
[01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:34.333]  Then Bush, 40 years ago I smoked marijuana, the whole drug war.
[01:09:35.635 --> 01:09:39.137]  We'll continue with Rand Paul calling the Iraq War a mistake.
[01:09:39.217 --> 01:09:40.037]  Good job doing that.
[01:09:40.718 --> 01:09:41.378]  Donald Trump.
[01:09:41.438 --> 01:09:43.039]  Rand Paul shouldn't be on the stage.
[01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:44.700]  And he's ugly.
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:47.661]  Donald Trump does great stuff and acts like he's five years old.
[01:09:48.602 --> 01:09:48.902]  Trump.
[01:09:49.462 --> 01:09:52.203]  This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.
[01:09:52.844 --> 01:09:54.785]  An amazing statement.
[01:09:54.865 --> 01:09:55.145]  Trump.
[01:09:55.205 --> 01:09:57.406]  Bush squares off over casinos in Florida.
[01:09:58.086 --> 01:09:59.707]  Jeb Bush defends his brother.
[01:10:00.427 --> 01:10:01.548]  Quote, he kept us safe.
[01:10:01.588 --> 01:10:03.149]  That ties into the whole Iraq statement.
[01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:12.655]  Then we'll get into Trump gives Bush a low high five, showing the fact that those two are buddies, which I do not like or trust at any level.
[01:10:13.255 --> 01:10:15.216]  But you got to go with the statements that are being made here.
[01:10:16.557 --> 01:10:22.461]  But first off, we've got three hours left in this special worldwide 28 hour broadcast.
[01:10:24.076 --> 01:10:42.883]  To help fund this TV slash radio show and the nightly news being put on satellite across North America and Central America, I should add, and then phase two, Europe, phase three, the Middle East, phase four, Africa, phase five, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, phase six, Southeast Asia, China, and more.
[01:10:43.644 --> 01:10:51.727]  So it's all happening and you've seen the phases we've done building InfoWars in 20 years from one guy on AXS television
[01:10:53.130 --> 01:10:54.051]  To what it is today.
[01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:58.253]  And it was Lister's idea eight years ago to have a money bomb.
[01:10:59.053 --> 01:10:59.533]  We did it.
[01:10:59.773 --> 01:11:01.274]  It raised $500,000.
[01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:04.696]  That money gave us the extra money to move into bigger, better studios.
[01:11:05.536 --> 01:11:09.078]  I didn't need to do a money bomb the last three years, so we didn't do it for three years.
[01:11:09.878 --> 01:11:10.819]  But now we need it.
[01:11:10.919 --> 01:11:33.053]  We have now raised, as of just a minute ago, they told me in my earpiece, if we go to Infowars.com forward slash money bomb, you can see the graph, and the latest folks that are donating, who wish to put their names on there, $605,182 has now been donated, and it's our goal, by the end of the broadcast, and it's really accelerating now, we may make it, to reach $1 million.
[01:11:35.948 --> 01:11:58.007]  And we're taking the profit from the nutraceutical sales, from the book sales, the video sales, the t-shirt sales, the tent sales, the non-GMO, non-hybrid heirloom seed sales, the storable food sales, the shortwave radio sales, the patriot apparel sales, everything at InfowarsStore.com where there's free shipping today.
[01:11:59.619 --> 01:12:01.940]  We also have these huge specials.

[01:12:15.924 --> 01:12:19.706]  The following Money Bomb Specials will be ending at the end of the broadcast at 3 p.m.
[01:12:19.726 --> 01:12:19.966]  today.
[01:12:20.966 --> 01:12:29.412]  15% off Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 that had been sold out, but we learned the truck was already on the way, so that'll be shipped out by next week.
[01:12:29.992 --> 01:12:35.275]  30% off Super Metal Vitality, biggest special ever, because free shipping on top of it is the best special ever on that.
[01:12:36.036 --> 01:12:38.477]  20% off Brain Force, incredible product, try it.
[01:12:38.777 --> 01:12:41.739]  20% off Silver Bullet, 15% off Deep Cleanse, 50% off Secret 12, 50% off Oxy Powder, and
[01:12:45.691 --> 01:12:50.678]  There are a whole bunch of raffles and eBay auctions that the guys came up with.
[01:12:50.798 --> 01:12:53.622]  They took some of the doodles I do on air and framed them.
[01:12:54.182 --> 01:12:56.586]  Who knew one of those is running for a thousand bucks right now?
[01:12:56.646 --> 01:12:57.887]  Thank you whoever you are out there.
[01:12:59.529 --> 01:12:59.910]  We've got
[01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:06.877]  The great high-quality head-down rifle that folks can enter an auction for.
[01:13:07.238 --> 01:13:21.372]  And all of you are winners because you're fighting the tip of the spear of a no-compromise, no-surrender, pro-liberty, pro-human, pro-life, pro-gun, pro-America, pro-sovereignty organization, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:26.251]  So, a lot of these things are about to close right now.
[01:13:26.531 --> 01:13:30.473]  Go to infowars.com forward slash money bomb if you want to get involved.
[01:13:30.553 --> 01:13:32.633]  Most of them have already closed out.
[01:13:33.734 --> 01:13:36.234]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:13:36.615 --> 01:13:38.095]  But this is how we fund things.
[01:13:38.115 --> 01:13:50.359]  We don't take tax money from you like NPR or MSNBC and then try to use this platform to say your kids don't belong to you and Christians should be put in jail and all the rest of it and your guns should be taken.
[01:13:51.192 --> 01:13:58.340]  We get up here, we're open libertarians, open pro-freedom people that hate tyranny with a passion of just crazed fury.
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:06.048]  And we're coming for the globalists, and we want to send the satellite signal when this phase is successful, and I really think it will be by the providence of God.
[01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:06.909]  I pray it will be.
[01:14:06.949 --> 01:14:07.729]  Please pray with us.
[01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:09.471]  I don't say that as mumbo-jumbo, folks.
[01:14:09.792 --> 01:14:11.213]  I'm not some guy that is perfect.
[01:14:11.273 --> 01:14:12.514]  It's not that I'm not worldly.
[01:14:12.755 --> 01:14:13.736]  I'm a man, believe me.
[01:14:14.156 --> 01:14:15.878]  But I have a relationship with Christ.
[01:14:16.278 --> 01:14:17.579]  I couldn't be here without God.
[01:14:17.839 --> 01:14:19.741]  God has gotten me out of so much crap before.
[01:14:20.061 --> 01:14:20.862]  Pulled my bacon.
[01:14:21.222 --> 01:14:23.424]  You people that don't believe in God, you're really missing out.
[01:14:23.724 --> 01:14:25.626]  I don't mean the God you find at these fake churches.
[01:14:25.926 --> 01:14:28.088]  I mean the God you find in your heart at 3 a.m.
[01:14:28.128 --> 01:14:28.869]  hitting rock bottom.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.822]  And I wouldn't be worth it to be alive without my relationship with Christ.
[01:14:34.462 --> 01:14:39.204]  And I just pray that people out there will support this broadcast so we can reach more people.
[01:14:39.644 --> 01:14:46.267]  Because I'm telling you, the world doesn't listen to these fake government-run Bible-thumpers pushing Christianity on them because it's not Christianity.
[01:14:46.567 --> 01:14:48.008]  It's the system that's captured that.
[01:14:48.368 --> 01:14:49.649]  It's designed to turn folks off.
[01:14:49.989 --> 01:14:51.850]  This broadcast, read about it online.
[01:14:52.210 --> 01:15:06.998]  Talk to folks around you, has led more people to God, more people to Christ, because of God moving through people's hearts and minds, learning about world government, learning about forced abortion, learning about baby harvesting, learning about chimeras, learning about the Illuminati.
[01:15:07.278 --> 01:15:09.620]  I don't have to tell people they better get Jesus.
[01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:14.482]  You learn about the New World Order and the satanic takeover, you're gonna get Jesus!
[01:15:14.743 --> 01:15:15.883]  Do you understand that?
[01:15:16.063 --> 01:15:18.585]  Because the devil is taking over right now!
[01:15:19.125 --> 01:15:21.266]  And people better get their hearts and minds right!
[01:15:21.506 --> 01:15:22.707]  And they better take action!
[01:15:22.867 --> 01:15:24.807]  And they better fight back with everything they got!
[01:15:25.087 --> 01:15:26.568]  Because the enemy is coming in!
[01:15:26.788 --> 01:15:27.488]  Worldwide!
[01:15:28.049 --> 01:15:31.270]  You ain't seen nothing yet imploding the borders in Europe and the US!
[01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:33.811]  You ain't seen nothing yet with paramilitary police!
[01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:35.232]  You ain't seen nothing yet!
[01:15:35.252 --> 01:15:37.973]  And I'll tell the globalists, they ain't seen nothing yet!
[01:15:38.393 --> 01:15:40.814]  Because for every evil action there is an opposite.
[01:15:41.715 --> 01:15:42.216]  We're good to go.
[01:15:56.735 --> 01:15:56.995]  I think?
[01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:17.252]  Raffle, you can enter to get the rifle.
[01:16:17.512 --> 01:16:18.753]  Tell folks about that, Joe Biggs.
[01:16:18.773 --> 01:16:31.183]  All right, so anybody who donates $1,000 or more, by the end of the broadcast, what we're going to do is we're going to tally up all those names, put those names into a hat, and then at that point, what we're going to do is we're going to reach in and pick out who is going to win this rifle.
[01:16:31.523 --> 01:16:34.285]  Now, this is a one-of-a-kind head-down Triton 10.
[01:16:34.325 --> 01:16:35.066]  This is custom.
[01:16:35.546 --> 01:16:38.088]  They broke the mold when they made this, so there's no more going to be made.
[01:16:38.369 --> 01:16:43.473]  It's got a custom Cerakote job, and it's also been signed by Alex Jones as well.
[01:16:44.033 --> 01:17:00.097]  So, this is a high-quality rifle, the tactical buttstock, and then also Georgia Optics, the guys that give us the optics we have on the InfoWars store, as well as those G-Shock watches, they will be giving us a sight and optics to put on top of this as well.
[01:17:00.577 --> 01:17:05.098]  You can find all their optics at InfoWarsStore.com, and again, it's free shipping on everything right now.
[01:17:05.418 --> 01:17:06.058]  Exactly, thank you.
[01:17:06.258 --> 01:17:07.738]  No, no, please keep talking about the rifle.
[01:17:07.778 --> 01:17:09.719]  How do they go, how do they enter the raffle?
[01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:25.291]  So yeah, all you have to do is donate $1,000 or more, and by the end of the broadcast, you have about a little bit less than three hours, your name will be automatically entered in for a chance to own this piece of history, this one-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have this headcount.
[01:17:25.311 --> 01:17:26.492]  You gotta see it in person.
[01:17:26.532 --> 01:17:28.033]  What's that finish it's got?
[01:17:28.093 --> 01:17:29.794]  It looks like a snake kind of skin.
[01:17:29.894 --> 01:17:31.736]  It's a desert tan, snake skin.
[01:17:32.316 --> 01:17:33.557]  That's also signed by you, buddy.
[01:17:33.757 --> 01:17:34.438]  Yeah, me too as well.
[01:17:34.918 --> 01:17:35.499]  Folks want that.
[01:17:35.539 --> 01:17:36.881]  I tell you, I've got one of these rifles.
[01:17:37.362 --> 01:17:39.045]  It's not as fancy as this, but it's the same build.
[01:17:39.065 --> 01:17:41.929]  And the most awesome .223 ever.
[01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:44.293]  So lightweight, so accurate, it's sick.
[01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:48.821]  And to think I bought rifles that cost almost twice as much and aren't as good, that does make me sick.
[01:17:50.615 --> 01:17:53.056]  Of course, you pretty much got that rifle tattooed on your arm, too, don't you, Joe?
[01:17:53.076 --> 01:17:54.377]  Yeah, that's what I had in Afghanistan.
[01:17:54.397 --> 01:17:55.937]  What was the name of this baby in Afghanistan?
[01:17:56.137 --> 01:17:57.898]  That was an M4 with a .203 grenade launcher.
[01:17:57.958 --> 01:17:59.199]  No, I know, but I'm sure it had a name.
[01:18:00.559 --> 01:18:01.479]  Oh, uh... Sexy?
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:01.960]  Accurate.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.241]  So you never named your rifles?
[01:18:04.541 --> 01:18:04.761]  Nah.
[01:18:05.701 --> 01:18:06.802]  Alright, Joe, you're awesome.
[01:18:06.822 --> 01:18:07.282]  Thank you, buddy.
[01:18:08.687 --> 01:18:10.328]  There's Joe Biggs, so that's what we're doing.
[01:18:10.388 --> 01:18:17.813]  Now, I'm going to skip this network break because it's special 28-hour broadcast so that I can get to a bunch of these clips without too much commentary.
[01:18:18.113 --> 01:18:19.614]  You'll hear the commentary of my reporters.
[01:18:19.854 --> 01:18:22.396]  This is from our feed covering it last night.
[01:18:22.736 --> 01:18:25.638]  And if you wanted to tune into a debate without our interruptions, you can.
[01:18:26.178 --> 01:18:34.761]  We do at Mystery Science Theater to praise it when our folks think it's praiseworthy, but to also shout it down when it's a bunch of garbage and counter it in real time.
[01:18:35.282 --> 01:18:36.522]  And here is the clip already played.
[01:18:36.562 --> 01:18:44.525]  A bunch of clips we haven't played are coming up of Senator Cruz saying Planned Parenthood is a criminal enterprise.
[01:18:44.545 --> 01:18:47.767]  Then we're going to go through the other clips.
[01:18:47.787 --> 01:18:50.928]  But here's Senator Ted Cruz saying Planned Parenthood's a criminal enterprise.
[01:18:51.974 --> 01:18:54.795]  Well, let me tell you, Dan, number one, I'm proud to stand for life.
[01:18:55.135 --> 01:18:57.136]  These Planned Parenthood videos are horrifying.
[01:18:57.176 --> 01:18:59.636]  I would encourage every American to watch these videos.
[01:19:00.396 --> 01:19:07.198]  See senior Planned Parenthood officials callously, heartlessly bartering and selling the body parts of human beings.
[01:19:07.899 --> 01:19:09.959]  And then ask yourself, are these my values?
[01:19:10.019 --> 01:19:11.080]  These are horrifying.
[01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:16.621]  On these videos, Planned Parenthood also essentially confesses to multiple felonies.
[01:19:16.681 --> 01:19:18.982]  It is a felony with 10 years jail term.
[01:19:19.682 --> 01:19:22.824]  To sell the body parts of unborn children for profit.
[01:19:22.844 --> 01:19:24.986]  That's what these videos show Planned Parenthood doing.
[01:19:25.506 --> 01:19:26.327]  Absolutely!
[01:19:26.727 --> 01:19:32.631]  We shouldn't be sending $500 million of taxpayer money to funding an ongoing criminal enterprise.
[01:19:32.671 --> 01:19:41.357]  And I'll tell you, the fact that Republican leadership in both houses has begun this discussion by preemptively surrendering to Barack Obama.
[01:19:41.797 --> 01:19:44.880]  And saying we'll give in because Obama threatens a veto.
[01:19:45.851 --> 01:19:48.972]  You know, Obama's committed to his principles, his liberal principles.
[01:19:49.292 --> 01:19:50.172]  He will fight for them.
[01:19:50.252 --> 01:19:55.494]  He says, I will veto any budget that doesn't fund Planned Parenthood and Republicans surrender.
[01:19:55.794 --> 01:19:59.095]  We need to stop surrendering and start standing for our principles.
[01:19:59.115 --> 01:19:59.575]  Amen to that.
[01:20:00.135 --> 01:20:03.396]  Now, that was exciting, but it didn't get our reporters chomping at the bit.
[01:20:03.496 --> 01:20:09.878]  This clip got them basically to start celebrating, because it's a big deal.
[01:20:11.081 --> 01:20:25.111]  In a debate like this with 35 million viewers to talk about vaccines, we were seeing the saving of untold children to break this membrane of propaganda, this confidence game that vaccines aren't killing and brain-damaging our children en masse.
[01:20:25.572 --> 01:20:33.857]  And then Carson, the brain surgeon, sits there and says, you know, we are giving the kids too many vaccines, but it's not causing any problems, no autism.
[01:20:34.298 --> 01:20:35.419]  Read the insert, folks.
[01:20:35.439 --> 01:20:37.460]  That's a load of bull.
[01:20:38.221 --> 01:20:39.902]  Let's go ahead and go to this epic clip.
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:49.385]  Hey, let's go to what they're saying right now because Donald Trump is making an epic statement about the connection of autism and vaccines.
[01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:04.459]  I mean, it looks just like it's meant for a horse, not for a child.
[01:21:04.879 --> 01:21:18.788]  And we've had so many instances, people that work for me just the other day, two years old, two and a half years old, a child, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick.
[01:21:18.948 --> 01:21:19.728]  This is great.
[01:21:19.768 --> 01:21:20.769]  He's doing a great job.
[01:21:20.849 --> 01:21:23.511]  I only say, I'm in favor of vaccines.
[01:21:23.551 --> 01:21:23.871]  Same amount.
[01:21:27.493 --> 01:21:29.395]  Just in, in little sections.
[01:21:29.415 --> 01:21:31.396]  And that's what I said earlier, I agree with that.
[01:21:31.456 --> 01:21:32.177]  Excellent, excellent.
[01:21:32.317 --> 01:21:37.381]  I think you're going to see a big impact on autism.
[01:21:37.401 --> 01:21:40.704]  Good job, he didn't backtrack, I like that.
[01:21:40.724 --> 01:21:41.064]  That's right.
[01:21:41.104 --> 01:21:42.065]  He's an okay doctor.
[01:21:49.651 --> 01:21:51.552]  Dr. Carson saying, oh he's a good doctor.
[01:21:52.173 --> 01:22:00.338]  As if we can't make our health decisions, as if we can't read the inserts, as if we can't see autism going from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 58 CDC zone numbers.
[01:22:00.538 --> 01:22:01.919]  They say by 2025 it'll be 1 in 3.
[01:22:02.199 --> 01:22:02.860]  1 in 10 in 2025, 2030, 1 in 3.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:16.041]  Oh, he's a good doctor.
[01:22:16.081 --> 01:22:20.922]  We should just do what Big Pharma says with the hundreds of vaccines they want to make mandatory.
[01:22:21.302 --> 01:22:23.743]  Used to be 6 or 7 they push, then it was 14, 25, 35.
[01:22:23.923 --> 01:22:31.146]  It's 49 vaccines they're trying to make mandatory right now, and the new list they've got's over 100.
[01:22:31.186 --> 01:22:35.388]  And they get up there and lie and say it's the law when it isn't.
[01:22:36.608 --> 01:22:39.009]  And doctors sit there and nurses pressure people.
[01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:43.831]  And then when you say no, they go, I actually don't give my kids vaccines either.
[01:22:44.131 --> 01:22:49.255]  Then it turns out the elite are getting, quote, clean vaccines, that's London Guardian, from special labs.
[01:22:50.575 --> 01:22:56.299]  See, they act like we don't know about the technology of learned immunity, of artificial immunity.
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.621]  Even good vaccines have side effects.
[01:23:00.162 --> 01:23:08.147]  But the crap they're shoveling at us, and at the level they know, in studies, it's brain damaging guinea pigs, mice, rats, and monkeys.
[01:23:09.582 --> 01:23:10.423]  They're doing it on purpose.
[01:23:11.583 --> 01:23:21.830]  They know you give 14, 15 shots to a newborn baby in the first day, that baby's brain is going to be screwed up for life.
[01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:26.033]  And then the second round, the second round at what?
[01:23:26.053 --> 01:23:26.813]  Eight, nine months.
[01:23:26.893 --> 01:23:35.519]  And then nine months later, the third round, 18 months after birth, they're given the coup de grace.
[01:23:37.366 --> 01:23:39.066]  They're giving the creme de la creme.
[01:23:39.807 --> 01:23:40.907]  The final blow.
[01:23:40.927 --> 01:23:45.488]  And we've had the nurses, registered nurses, head nurses on.
[01:23:45.748 --> 01:23:47.908]  And when they're on, for 2-3 hours we take calls.
[01:23:48.948 --> 01:23:55.410]  With the nurses going, yeah, I'm in the ER ward or I'm in the preemie ward and we'll have an 8-month-old baby doing great.
[01:23:56.170 --> 01:24:00.151]  And the baby will be in there for 2-3 days and they'll come in and they'll say, time to give the shots.
[01:24:01.175 --> 01:24:02.816]  And we'll say, but it brain damages them.
[01:24:02.836 --> 01:24:04.497]  And they say, you're fired if you don't do it.
[01:24:04.937 --> 01:24:07.058]  So we get the respirators and defibrillators ready.
[01:24:07.638 --> 01:24:09.539]  We give them the shots and we watch them start dying.
[01:24:09.559 --> 01:24:11.781]  And a lot of times we can't save them.
[01:24:13.642 --> 01:24:15.583]  Oh, but Donald's not a doctor, is he?
[01:24:16.763 --> 01:24:19.365]  Of course, Donald does the politically correct thing that Japan done.
[01:24:20.299 --> 01:24:22.080]  Because the Japanese were revolting 20 years ago.
[01:24:22.481 --> 01:24:24.963]  They only do 5 or 6 vaccines and they space them out.
[01:24:25.643 --> 01:24:28.385]  You can't space out 49 or 100, Donald.
[01:24:29.026 --> 01:24:32.449]  And they're dirty because they have liability protection, Donald.
[01:24:32.969 --> 01:24:35.771]  Imagine if Ford or Chevy had liability protection.
[01:24:35.971 --> 01:24:39.214]  Their cars would be blowing up every day, but they don't have liability.
[01:24:39.674 --> 01:24:41.155]  I don't have liability protection.
[01:24:41.436 --> 01:24:42.757]  I gotta watch what I say.
[01:24:44.124 --> 01:24:49.793]  They got a get-out-of-jail-free card, they're crapping all over us, and we're sick of it!
[01:24:50.494 --> 01:24:52.457]  That's why it's being forced as a debate issue.
[01:24:53.639 --> 01:24:54.982]  Let's go ahead and finish the clip, excuse me.
[01:24:56.662 --> 01:24:58.423]  Good job.
[01:24:58.483 --> 01:25:00.785]  He didn't backtrack.
[01:25:00.905 --> 01:25:01.245]  I like that.
[01:25:01.265 --> 01:25:01.686]  That's right.
[01:25:01.746 --> 01:25:02.707]  He's an okay doctor.
[01:25:04.228 --> 01:25:05.008]  Smartass.
[01:25:05.129 --> 01:25:07.150]  I don't like Carson.
[01:25:07.190 --> 01:25:08.491]  Trust me because I'm a doctor.
[01:25:08.531 --> 01:25:08.872]  Come on.
[01:25:08.912 --> 01:25:09.592]  I don't want to hear that.
[01:25:10.613 --> 01:25:13.275]  I can read the stuff myself, Dr. Ben Carson.
[01:25:14.036 --> 01:25:16.458]  Read the Constitution, jerk, if you're going to run for president.
[01:25:17.162 --> 01:25:19.643]  There's no autism associated with vaccinations.
[01:25:44.241 --> 01:25:51.485]  Notice, though, we've gone from them saying a few years ago, no side effects, period, save and effective, it's all a conspiracy theory, to having to admit they're serious problems.
[01:25:52.426 --> 01:25:52.886]  You see that?
[01:25:54.067 --> 01:26:00.210]  That's how you win, folks, and we are winning, thanks to you spreading the word, and thanks to InfoWars being the tip of the spear.
[01:26:01.691 --> 01:26:07.715]  Back during the H1N1 situation six years ago, I got called and threatened by a big pharma with lawsuits.
[01:26:08.115 --> 01:26:08.935]  I had to get lawyers.
[01:26:09.075 --> 01:26:10.116]  I said, go ahead and sue me.
[01:26:12.003 --> 01:26:16.646]  I then had the enjoyment of being followed around by PIs for no reason, just to harass me.
[01:26:17.507 --> 01:26:21.109]  And then I got some really nasty threats and people trying to break my family up.
[01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:28.034]  And I've had them run industrial-level operations against this organization for it.
[01:26:28.174 --> 01:26:29.095]  You think I care?
[01:26:30.496 --> 01:26:31.797]  Let me tell the Newell daughter something right now.
[01:26:32.357 --> 01:26:34.218]  I'm not afraid of you dying for a good cause.
[01:26:34.418 --> 01:26:36.660]  In fact, beam me up, Scotty.
[01:26:38.837 --> 01:26:41.858]  You think I'm gonna back off because you've threatened me and my family?
[01:26:42.198 --> 01:26:44.218]  You think I'm gonna back off because you follow me around?
[01:26:44.558 --> 01:26:47.159]  All you did was ensure that I know I'm right and I'm never stopping.
[01:26:48.119 --> 01:26:54.721]  You think I'm scared to die so that little kids don't get brain damaged by the millions and crap all over themselves until they die at 45?
[01:26:55.181 --> 01:26:57.082]  And so their parents go through living hell?
[01:26:57.382 --> 01:27:00.142]  You think I'm scared to die fighting for the innocents?
[01:27:01.483 --> 01:27:06.024]  I'm no hero, but my very DNA is for standing up for children and innocents and women.
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.322]  And so, you just don't get it.
[01:27:08.522 --> 01:27:09.563]  See, that's because you're cowards.
[01:27:09.884 --> 01:27:11.306]  You've lived your lives as cowards.
[01:27:11.686 --> 01:27:12.727]  You've always backed down.
[01:27:12.747 --> 01:27:14.610]  You've always been scared by peer pressure alone.
[01:27:15.210 --> 01:27:16.552]  I never cared about peer pressure.
[01:27:16.832 --> 01:27:17.974]  I never cared about anything.
[01:27:18.654 --> 01:27:19.836]  Except just being a human being.
[01:27:20.537 --> 01:27:25.022]  And so, to the vaccine makers and Big Pharma and all of you, I know you're the tip of the pyramid.
[01:27:25.823 --> 01:27:26.964]  I know you know what you're doing.
[01:27:27.685 --> 01:27:33.131]  Bayer Pharmaceuticals shipping out the blood factor to kill all the kids, the hemophiliacs that came out in court, you knew.
[01:27:34.233 --> 01:27:42.001]  Dr. Salk laughing at his apprentice on tape about how they knew the SV40 was going to kill millions, but so what, there's too many people, ha ha ha.
[01:27:42.862 --> 01:27:43.962]  See, their life matters.
[01:27:44.303 --> 01:27:48.864]  You try to baseball bat their head in, my gosh, you'll be a murderer terrorist on TV.
[01:27:49.365 --> 01:27:58.068]  But they laugh about your mama or your daddy dying of an excruciating cancer that didn't exist before the polio vaccine, and it's funny to them.
[01:27:58.368 --> 01:28:05.671]  My grandmother, 90 years old, had polio since 1954, gone through living hell, almost died.
[01:28:06.863 --> 01:28:13.475]  I don't think it's funny that she caught it a week after getting the vaccine and caught the very strain that she took.
[01:28:14.642 --> 01:28:17.024]  It's all funny to you what you've done to us and our families.
[01:28:17.224 --> 01:28:18.265]  You think it's all cute.
[01:28:18.865 --> 01:28:20.026]  Well, I'll tell you something.
[01:28:20.706 --> 01:28:29.913]  All we're doing is taking our time educating everybody and getting ready, because when we bring you to justice, there's going to be a worldwide Nuremberg, the likes of which the world's ever seen.
[01:28:30.373 --> 01:28:40.240]  And you're going to have a trial by jury, and all your crimes are going to be dredged up, and you're all going to be absolutely punished for what you've done.
[01:28:41.541 --> 01:28:43.163]  But I don't even take any pleasure in that.
[01:28:44.059 --> 01:28:59.809]  That's got to be done so justice is served and so other sick freaks like you that think you're better than us and that get off on brain damaging people and that get off on crippling people and that get off on hurting people and that get off on playing God can learn you're not God.
[01:29:00.829 --> 01:29:05.792]  So fill your hand anytime you want with me, because I'm free.
[01:29:06.092 --> 01:29:08.033]  I'll never be dirtbags like you.
[01:29:08.353 --> 01:29:09.594]  I'll never be a coward.
[01:29:09.774 --> 01:29:11.795]  I'll never be a sack of filth like you.
[01:29:11.815 --> 01:29:14.417]  I will never worship your god, the devil.
[01:29:14.817 --> 01:29:16.478]  I will never serve your tyranny.
[01:29:16.958 --> 01:29:19.620]  I will never bow to you no matter what you do.
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:27.184]  Yeah, you could grab me and drug me up and roll me out a year later after electroshock some fried husk, but my spirit would have already flown.
[01:29:27.664 --> 01:29:32.087]  You will never dominate me because I belong to God.
[01:29:32.527 --> 01:29:40.252]  And that's the decision the public has to make, which side they're on spiritually, and this New World Order will start falling right as it's completed.
[01:29:40.732 --> 01:29:43.454]  Yes, you'll have your world government for one hour!
[01:29:44.639 --> 01:29:45.479]  But that's it!
[01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:47.400]  That's all you've got!
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:53.443]  And we're setting off the explosives in the Info War right now that will topple you forever.
[01:29:53.923 --> 01:29:55.223]  You've already been defeated.
[01:29:55.483 --> 01:29:56.924]  You are the Walking Dead.
[01:29:57.604 --> 01:29:59.625]  We'll be back with your phone calls and more clips.
[01:30:00.165 --> 01:30:01.086]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.566 --> 01:30:03.166]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:04.087 --> 01:30:06.768]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:11.926 --> 01:30:17.291]  The Miss America pageant is known for beautiful women who sometimes give rather amusing answers.
[01:30:17.511 --> 01:30:22.035]  But recently, Miss South Carolina turned the tide when she was asked about this.
[01:30:22.055 --> 01:30:26.119]  Do you support a ban on military style assault weapons?
[01:30:27.598 --> 01:30:30.319]  I don't, but I think it's because we need to increase education.
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:31.460]  We have to go back there.
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:39.104]  If we teach people the proper way to use guns, then we will reduce the risk of having gun-related accidents.
[01:30:39.484 --> 01:30:41.145]  It starts with education.
[01:30:41.725 --> 01:30:46.688]  Even before she could finish answering her question, her response received a massive applause.
[01:30:47.188 --> 01:30:53.272]  Demonstrating strong support for gun rights despite the establishment's ongoing gun demonization campaign.
[01:30:53.792 --> 01:31:04.039]  And yes, there have been high-profile slayings with fully automatic rifles, but the FBI's own numbers show that you're more likely to be killed by a blunt object such as a baseball bat or hammer.
[01:31:04.219 --> 01:31:07.561]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[01:33:32.829 --> 01:33:36.990]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:37.471 --> 01:33:40.292]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:40.312 --> 01:33:41.512]  In the heat of the night!
[01:33:43.673 --> 01:33:48.175]  You're like black in my eyes.
[01:33:56.579 --> 01:33:58.080]  Time to knock the globalists dead.
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:33:59.401]  It's time to find our souls.
[01:34:00.361 --> 01:34:01.882]  Time to find our guts again.
[01:34:11.028 --> 01:34:12.028]  Knock them dead, kid.
[01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:15.630]  Knock them dead.
[01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:19.332]  Well, here's a story out of NBC.
[01:34:21.998 --> 01:34:28.762]  FAA says American Airlines flights grounded and stopped nationwide.
[01:34:28.822 --> 01:34:29.563]  Another glitch!
[01:34:30.163 --> 01:34:32.124]  Just like we saw on 9-11.
[01:34:32.905 --> 01:34:39.229]  There were all these glitches that morning for American and United and the stand-downs and all the rest of it.
[01:34:39.269 --> 01:34:40.629]  I'm not saying that's about to happen here.
[01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:45.833]  We saw massive insider trading on Wall Street, but no investigation of that, of course, because we can't find out what really happened.
[01:34:45.853 --> 01:34:46.773]  We just know there's a cover-up.
[01:34:48.334 --> 01:34:50.956]  The Saudis are involved and we blame Saddam Hussein.
[01:34:52.162 --> 01:35:05.025]  And I was just out there during the break in the break room getting a glass of water, and I actually saw Senator Lindsey Graham on Wolf Blitzer talking about basically defending the Iraq War.
[01:35:05.105 --> 01:35:06.185]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:35:06.645 --> 01:35:12.826]  We've got a clip of that from the debates we're going to be playing in a moment, but I want to go to your phone calls, folks that have been holding first.
[01:35:12.846 --> 01:35:14.426]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:35:14.446 --> 01:35:14.486]  800-259-9231.
[01:35:14.506 --> 01:35:15.847]  We're going to go to Margaret.
[01:35:22.441 --> 01:35:25.702]  Jameson, Eileen, Sue, Scott, and others here in just a moment.
[01:35:26.062 --> 01:35:27.803]  I love it when we get a whole bunch of women calling in.
[01:35:27.863 --> 01:35:33.185]  Usually it's 5 to 1 men, even though our demographic shows about 37% of our listeners are women.
[01:35:33.485 --> 01:35:36.907]  So great to have Sue, Eileen, Marguerite, and others.
[01:35:37.667 --> 01:35:40.388]  Now, Jameson can be male or female.
[01:35:41.411 --> 01:35:42.611]  We have another lady on there as well.
[01:35:42.651 --> 01:35:44.512]  So there's a majority of women calling in.
[01:35:44.532 --> 01:35:45.772]  So that's always interesting.
[01:35:45.792 --> 01:35:50.713]  A lot of times when I talk about vaccines, women call in because they're so upset about watching the brain-damaged babies.
[01:35:51.153 --> 01:35:56.554]  They just wish they could get the good vaccines and then weigh the benefit versus the problem.
[01:35:57.294 --> 01:36:00.915]  Because there's a bunch of vaccines I want to give my kids, like tetanus shots.
[01:36:01.975 --> 01:36:05.216]  But it almost killed one of my uncles, almost killed one of my cousins.
[01:36:06.271 --> 01:36:11.014]  The UN got caught adding pathogens to it to sterilize women on record.
[01:36:11.134 --> 01:36:14.456]  I mean, it's a dangerous one to get because they know everybody gets it.
[01:36:15.677 --> 01:36:17.017]  So we're gonna go to your calls here in a moment.
[01:36:17.058 --> 01:36:24.682]  Just very briefly, we are doing a 28-hour transmission that ends at 3 o'clock Central in about two and a half hours.
[01:36:26.803 --> 01:36:30.586]  But we'll also, of course, be back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:36:30.646 --> 01:36:31.206]  to 2 p.m.
[01:36:31.386 --> 01:36:33.628]  Central Standard Time in the Sunday broadcast, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:42.642]  But we are running free shipping, and I'm just going to extend the free shipping throughout today, because that makes it simpler.
[01:36:43.342 --> 01:37:00.488]  But I've been told by the folks in the back that they will end today a whole bunch of the other specials, like 15% off Survival Shield Nixon I and I and X2 that was sold out, but we know a truck's coming, so we're going to go ahead and keep it up for sale, so we can start shipping it out by Monday.
[01:37:00.508 --> 01:37:03.049]  30% off all Super Metal Vitality.
[01:37:04.346 --> 01:37:06.688]  But for the next two hours only, that's going to end.
[01:37:06.708 --> 01:37:13.094]  20% off Brain Force, 20% off Silver Bullet, 50% off Deep Cleanse, 50% off Secret 12, 50% off Oxy Powder.
[01:37:13.414 --> 01:37:14.555]  But it all ends.
[01:37:14.715 --> 01:37:19.600]  All these huge discounts end at the end of the broadcast, in two and a half hours.
[01:37:22.125 --> 01:37:25.788]  We'll have some other specials, but obviously they can't be the best specials ever.
[01:37:26.188 --> 01:37:32.473]  You add free shipping to 30% off Super Metal Vitality, there's really not even profit there, it's a lost leader.
[01:37:33.014 --> 01:37:36.737]  But it brings other folks into the store, people tend to buy other stuff, so that's how we can do this.
[01:37:36.957 --> 01:37:45.804]  That's why people can sell something at a store at cost, or even losing money, because you come in there to buy, say, a battery at cost, well you end up buying some other stuff in the auto department.
[01:37:47.347 --> 01:37:51.611]  And look, we use all the above-board tactics of sales to fund this place independently.
[01:37:51.931 --> 01:37:57.375]  High quality, good customer service, a large selection, things I like, things I use.
[01:37:57.876 --> 01:38:00.218]  We don't have some research demographic department, really.
[01:38:00.638 --> 01:38:02.700]  We have demographics, but we don't really even look at them much.
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:04.401]  It's just, what do I use?
[01:38:04.441 --> 01:38:05.042]  What do you use?
[01:38:05.082 --> 01:38:05.762]  What do you like?
[01:38:06.383 --> 01:38:07.303]  What's been the best for you?
[01:38:08.044 --> 01:38:10.827]  Hey, this cook stove my dad got me five years ago is really great.
[01:38:10.847 --> 01:38:12.068]  It's a little bitty and portable.
[01:38:12.088 --> 01:38:12.709]  It's real cheap.
[01:38:13.029 --> 01:38:16.012]  Well, let's call them and become a distributor and sell it for the lowest price.
[01:38:16.472 --> 01:38:17.313]  That's five years ago.
[01:38:17.333 --> 01:38:18.274]  We're now the biggest seller.
[01:38:18.574 --> 01:38:21.897]  That particular little cook stove we have at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:38:22.658 --> 01:38:23.739]  That's just how this works.
[01:38:25.981 --> 01:38:31.026]  I turned down more than 30 firearms manufacturers because they just weren't the highest quality.
[01:38:33.032 --> 01:38:36.635]  And then I approached some of the best names out there and they said no thank you.
[01:38:37.216 --> 01:38:40.519]  And then Head Down fell in our lap and they're even better than what I thought was the best.
[01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:46.625]  So that's why we are supported by HDFirearms.com because I can do it and feel really good.
[01:38:48.166 --> 01:38:50.248]  And you can call it superstition whenever you want.
[01:38:51.069 --> 01:38:52.831]  If I screw somebody over,
[01:38:54.184 --> 01:38:55.925]  Metaphysically, I know it comes back on me.
[01:38:56.506 --> 01:39:01.089]  But it's not some sociopathic thing where I don't screw people over because I know it comes back on me.
[01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:02.571]  I was always like that.
[01:39:03.251 --> 01:39:10.517]  And I bring that up a lot because the problem in this world is those of us that are like that don't understand why other people aren't.
[01:39:11.057 --> 01:39:16.201]  Well, beyond understanding it, it's time to just not be involved with people that screw us over.
[01:39:16.962 --> 01:39:21.606]  It's time to withdraw our consent, withdraw our money, withdraw being nice to them.
[01:39:21.866 --> 01:39:22.806]  It's time to shun them.
[01:39:23.937 --> 01:39:27.724]  And they're going to get aggressive with us each time when they attack us to defend ourselves.
[01:39:28.386 --> 01:39:30.930]  And not shoot our mouths off about how big and bad we are.
[01:39:32.611 --> 01:39:41.293]  It's time to get ready when they come, when they try to come for us, when they try to put us in their FEMA camps, when they try to have their little communist brigades urinate all over us.
[01:39:41.713 --> 01:39:43.134]  It's time to give them a surprise.
[01:39:43.854 --> 01:39:46.874]  And it's time to stop their attempt to start a revolution killing cops.
[01:39:47.355 --> 01:39:50.375]  It's time for us to actually align with justice.
[01:39:50.735 --> 01:39:52.656]  And that doesn't mean it's with corrupt police departments.
[01:39:53.116 --> 01:39:57.357]  It's not justice to randomly kill some cop not knowing if they're a good person or a bad person.
[01:39:59.022 --> 01:40:02.985]  They want a direct revolution in this country as going after random police.
[01:40:03.666 --> 01:40:08.289]  Instead, if everything goes off, going after the actual kingpins.
[01:40:08.610 --> 01:40:09.891]  And that's not Barack Obama.
[01:40:10.832 --> 01:40:12.733]  I don't want anything to happen to Barack Obama.
[01:40:12.753 --> 01:40:14.234]  That would turn him into a martyr.
[01:40:14.695 --> 01:40:18.838]  In fact, the globalists, I think, and I've said this for six years, might do something to him.
[01:40:18.858 --> 01:40:24.903]  A failed suicide attempt, a failed assassination attempt,
[01:40:28.206 --> 01:40:28.566]  I don't know.
[01:40:45.882 --> 01:40:48.823]  To put Al-Qaeda and ISIS in charge to engage in mass murder.
[01:40:49.143 --> 01:41:04.748]  But the good news is, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the former deputy head of the CIA, who both just left last few months, went public last month and said our government runs Al-Qaeda and ISIS, we set up the whole deal, we were ordered to do it, we put out fake intelligence to the public.
[01:41:05.168 --> 01:41:05.949]  to cover this up.
[01:41:06.289 --> 01:41:07.470]  This is a horrible crime.
[01:41:07.870 --> 01:41:09.291]  Congress needs to investigate.
[01:41:09.571 --> 01:41:10.532]  And where is Congress?
[01:41:10.852 --> 01:41:15.056]  They're there with their tails between their legs because they know there's a mafia running America.
[01:41:15.316 --> 01:41:16.717]  They know foreign banks took over.
[01:41:17.297 --> 01:41:20.520]  And they just want to be part of the takeover and think they're going to be safe in that.
[01:41:21.841 --> 01:41:23.802]  You know where the bodies are buried, Congress.
[01:41:24.183 --> 01:41:26.264]  You know where the bodies are buried, FBI Director.
[01:41:26.604 --> 01:41:28.646]  You know where the bodies are buried, CIA Director.
[01:41:29.947 --> 01:41:34.591]  Nine times out of ten in history, when they bring in a tyranny like this,
[01:41:36.155 --> 01:41:38.738]  They take out everybody that went along with it.
[01:41:39.699 --> 01:41:52.172]  Unless you are a top-tier progenitor in on the original conspiracy, you will be killed, or you will be indicted, you will have your money stripped, and you'll be thrown out.
[01:41:54.056 --> 01:41:55.477]  That is a standard move.
[01:41:55.958 --> 01:41:58.420]  The globalists follow standard moves and formulae.
[01:41:58.941 --> 01:41:59.521]  You're idiots.
[01:42:00.402 --> 01:42:07.249]  Getting rid of the Republic, getting rid of checks and balances, getting rid of due process, getting rid of all that.
[01:42:07.749 --> 01:42:14.756]  You are getting rid of things that were fought for for 800 years under Magna Carta.
[01:42:15.096 --> 01:42:19.120]  By men a lot tougher and smarter than you, I will assure you.
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:24.380]  Just look at what you've done!
[01:42:25.841 --> 01:42:27.681]  Look at what you've turned this country into!
[01:42:28.001 --> 01:42:31.302]  Look at how you've degraded the incredible honor of the West!
[01:42:31.762 --> 01:42:33.282]  You are disgusting filth!
[01:42:34.302 --> 01:42:35.243]  You are a joke!
[01:42:36.343 --> 01:42:37.303]  You are anathema!
[01:42:37.483 --> 01:42:39.023]  Your ancestors spit on you!
[01:42:39.043 --> 01:42:43.764]  I will tell you this, it's never too late to turn around.
[01:42:44.384 --> 01:42:48.605]  It's never too late to realize you don't want to be part of this, and to get off the power trip.
[01:42:49.706 --> 01:42:51.666]  I'm gonna talk more about it later, I'm gonna go to your calls, excuse me.
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:56.161]  Margaret in Oklahoma, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:43:00.282 --> 01:43:01.722]  Yes, yes.
[01:43:02.022 --> 01:43:02.423]  Thank you.
[01:43:02.483 --> 01:43:03.763]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:43:04.623 --> 01:43:05.323]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:43:06.084 --> 01:43:10.325]  I actually have two people in my family who were damaged by vaccines.
[01:43:10.845 --> 01:43:13.326]  And it's the schools cope with it.
[01:43:13.366 --> 01:43:14.166]  There's so many.
[01:43:14.666 --> 01:43:15.586]  There's so many of us.
[01:43:15.967 --> 01:43:16.507]  It's amazing.
[01:43:16.747 --> 01:43:20.688]  What I want to talk about is about the Second Amendment.
[01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:28.013]  And about Eric Holder, even though he's not Attorney General anymore, when he was, he effectively destroyed the Second Amendment.
[01:43:31.455 --> 01:43:36.698]  Just the first 13 words, a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[01:43:37.359 --> 01:43:39.040]  Well-regulated means trained.
[01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:48.646]  He destroyed the Second Amendment when he threw a young man who never hurt anybody and was totally a good, kind person, threw him into prison for 26 years.
[01:43:49.713 --> 01:43:58.338]  The FBI lied, the kangaroo court was held... I know, the ATF loves throwing innocent gun owners in prison.
[01:43:58.658 --> 01:44:00.499]  They'll spend ten million dollars to do it.
[01:44:00.539 --> 01:44:01.339]  They hate good people.
[01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:06.502]  Now he's been in prison four and a half years, and they're burying his case.
[01:44:06.582 --> 01:44:09.704]  He tried to appeal, but the appeal is just lost.
[01:44:09.964 --> 01:44:12.005]  His name is Schaefer Cox, from Alaska.
[01:44:12.405 --> 01:44:15.086]  He claimed to be the leader of a 3,500 man militia.
[01:44:15.146 --> 01:44:16.667]  Now there's no more militias.
[01:44:18.464 --> 01:44:21.346]  Because they've really, really scared them off.
[01:44:21.546 --> 01:44:22.146]  There's nobody.
[01:44:22.226 --> 01:44:22.526]  I know.
[01:44:22.626 --> 01:44:30.711]  I used to have real militias on just to talk to them and then there'd be FBI agents in the parking lot when I walked out from the TV studio asking me what I was planning.
[01:44:31.472 --> 01:44:34.653]  And then I'd say, give me your ID and they'd laugh at me and get in their car and drive off.
[01:44:36.090 --> 01:44:37.030]  I just can't believe it.
[01:44:37.050 --> 01:44:37.751]  It's so sick.
[01:44:37.911 --> 01:44:39.471]  As if the militia's going to do anything.
[01:44:39.491 --> 01:44:45.054]  I mean, the FBI knows that their own agency blew up Oklahoma City with the ATF and German intelligence.
[01:44:45.074 --> 01:44:46.094]  I mean, I know all the names.
[01:44:46.354 --> 01:44:47.334]  I've talked to all the cops.
[01:44:47.374 --> 01:44:48.135]  I have the witnesses.
[01:44:48.155 --> 01:44:49.815]  I mean, can we just stop pretending?
[01:44:49.835 --> 01:44:53.417]  And I know the average FBI agent's a good man or woman, on average.
[01:44:53.457 --> 01:44:54.177]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:44:54.477 --> 01:44:55.718]  Your boss is above you.
[01:44:55.998 --> 01:44:58.159]  Eric Holder ran the cover-up of OKC.
[01:44:58.959 --> 01:45:02.602]  But Margaret, I could guess that a lot of women were calling in because I talked about vaccines.
[01:45:02.982 --> 01:45:04.764]  Funny you mentioned you've had family damaged by it.
[01:45:05.024 --> 01:45:11.129]  Why don't you add your testimony to the mountain range of people that have warned folks about what vaccines do.
[01:45:11.149 --> 01:45:14.652]  I mean, my own family is riddled with the damage of vaccines.
[01:45:14.692 --> 01:45:15.053]  Go ahead.
[01:45:15.513 --> 01:45:22.439]  Yeah, my son, when he was two and a half, he got this DPT in his leg.
[01:45:22.599 --> 01:45:23.600]  His leg was gone.
[01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.621]  His muscle, that muscle atrophied.
[01:45:25.902 --> 01:45:27.363]  They told us he had a Lou Gehrig disease.
[01:45:27.697 --> 01:45:29.118]  Then they told us it was a mystery disease.
[01:45:29.598 --> 01:45:33.520]  And he never married because he thought he had a genetic disease.
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.581]  Sure, mission complete.
[01:45:34.701 --> 01:45:35.281]  Absolutely.
[01:45:35.341 --> 01:45:40.624]  Lou Gehrig's and hundreds of other new neurological disorders are up multi-thousand percentage points.
[01:45:40.924 --> 01:45:41.805]  Now they've got headlines.
[01:45:42.045 --> 01:45:46.227]  By 2030, upwards of half of Americans could have neurological disorders.
[01:45:46.487 --> 01:45:47.188]  And no one asked.
[01:45:48.228 --> 01:45:50.790]  Pediatric cancers didn't exist 60 years ago.
[01:45:51.090 --> 01:45:52.070]  Now they're everywhere.
[01:45:53.031 --> 01:45:55.552]  And people are always, want to raise money for a little kid dying from leukemia?
[01:45:56.092 --> 01:45:56.893]  I'm just like, um...
[01:45:59.019 --> 01:46:02.382]  No, because that money just goes right into the folks that killed him.
[01:46:02.902 --> 01:46:05.544]  Ask yourselves why all the kids are getting cancer.
[01:46:05.564 --> 01:46:06.345]  God bless you, ma'am.
[01:46:07.065 --> 01:46:10.368]  We don't have time to hear her other vaccine damage story, but so what?
[01:46:10.388 --> 01:46:12.550]  You know, their son's leg rotted away.
[01:46:12.570 --> 01:46:13.911]  Hey, the government loves you.
[01:46:13.971 --> 01:46:14.792]  Take more shots.
[01:46:14.852 --> 01:46:15.412]  It's fine.
[01:46:16.613 --> 01:46:17.314]  God bless you, ma'am.
[01:46:17.354 --> 01:46:18.254]  I'm sorry for your son.
[01:46:19.395 --> 01:46:20.476]  They didn't get his soul, though.
[01:46:22.758 --> 01:46:25.260]  And see, I don't know how that works when they brain damage a baby.
[01:46:26.957 --> 01:46:28.739]  And they never attain full consciousness.
[01:46:29.479 --> 01:46:33.463]  I guess that soul just ends up when they die going right to God, so in a way it's a reprieve.
[01:46:34.264 --> 01:46:34.905]  I can't judge.
[01:46:35.405 --> 01:46:36.907]  See, the globalists know a lot of this stuff.
[01:46:37.567 --> 01:46:46.196]  I wonder, they wouldn't be brain-killing kids, or soft-killing them, mind-killing them, if they thought they weren't still getting the soul, because that's what they really want.
[01:46:48.223 --> 01:46:54.706]  So maybe they think when they're all brain damaged and get all crazed and then get older that they'll get smart enough to get corrupted and maybe possessed.
[01:46:54.786 --> 01:46:55.186]  I don't know.
[01:46:55.206 --> 01:47:00.348]  I mean, I'm trying to figure out why these demons from whatever dimension they come from want to brain damage the kids.
[01:47:00.768 --> 01:47:04.049]  Because I know God doesn't damn people to hell that never were conscious.
[01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.670]  I don't know.
[01:47:05.710 --> 01:47:06.691]  It's just food for thought.
[01:47:07.431 --> 01:47:08.931]  Let's talk to Scott in Nebraska.
[01:47:08.951 --> 01:47:09.552]  You're on the air.
[01:47:09.592 --> 01:47:09.932]  Welcome.
[01:47:11.593 --> 01:47:13.593]  Yeah, this is Scott in Nebraska.
[01:47:13.813 --> 01:47:14.934]  Basically an army retired.
[01:47:15.799 --> 01:47:25.561]  I'm a retired Army officer, and by going out to the VA, and I was sitting in the VA one time, and this guy, he's a black guy, said, I used to be 300 pounds.
[01:47:25.581 --> 01:47:31.342]  He said, they gave me a shot of something out here, and now I weigh 120 pounds.
[01:47:31.362 --> 01:47:32.962]  He said, there was something in that needle.
[01:47:33.922 --> 01:47:41.164]  And so, the other part of that is, I've been waiting seven years for the conclusion of my VA case.
[01:47:41.184 --> 01:47:43.084]  You were talking about, they're taking property,
[01:47:44.241 --> 01:47:45.722]  And still putting out your guns and stuff.
[01:47:45.742 --> 01:47:56.251]  Well, the VA had it set up that if I would claim depression, go talk to a psychiatrist and they would give me maybe another 30% on top of what I got.
[01:47:56.291 --> 01:47:57.311]  It could save my house.
[01:47:58.472 --> 01:48:00.754]  But I decided not to do that.
[01:48:00.814 --> 01:48:02.135]  I decided to hold out.
[01:48:02.335 --> 01:48:04.257]  It's going to be another two years before
[01:48:05.237 --> 01:48:11.120]  I see anything from the VA as far as compensation or if they decide to compensate me at all.
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:11.560]  Think about it.
[01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:12.601]  There's a war on vets.
[01:48:12.681 --> 01:48:13.621]  It's an admitted war.
[01:48:14.061 --> 01:48:14.681]  And they tell you.
[01:48:14.922 --> 01:48:16.502]  I've talked to countless vets on air and off air.
[01:48:16.542 --> 01:48:21.325]  They say, OK, we'll give you that surgery for your skin cancer.
[01:48:21.345 --> 01:48:23.886]  We'll give you that surgery for your heart problems.
[01:48:24.486 --> 01:48:26.647]  We're talking about sometimes young guys, but also old guys.
[01:48:26.667 --> 01:48:30.889]  But we want you to go to a psychiatrist and admit that you want to kill people or that you're mentally ill.
[01:48:30.909 --> 01:48:32.750]  And they go, but what?
[01:48:32.830 --> 01:48:33.430]  Just do it.
[01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:34.591]  We'll give you a full disability.
[01:48:35.168 --> 01:48:38.851]  But I got a job, I just can't afford the insurance that'll cover this.
[01:48:39.131 --> 01:48:40.532]  Will you just give me a heart surgery?
[01:48:40.552 --> 01:48:42.193]  And they're just like, no.
[01:48:43.294 --> 01:48:45.335]  I mean, just think about how evil that is.
[01:48:47.817 --> 01:48:48.377]  Yeah, I know.
[01:48:48.577 --> 01:48:50.418]  They've been delaying it.
[01:48:50.819 --> 01:48:55.682]  I fought the county for two years and then I went finally to the state and said, hey, this county's wrong.
[01:48:56.371 --> 01:49:01.634]  And so for two years they basically lied, and the guy that ran the county mysteriously just retired.
[01:49:01.694 --> 01:49:05.596]  So I don't know if he had anything to do with it, but for five years I've been fighting these guys.
[01:49:06.056 --> 01:49:07.497]  And there's something else I wanted to ask you.
[01:49:07.537 --> 01:49:11.519]  If you knew a lawyer for MKUltra, I need to get into that.
[01:49:11.539 --> 01:49:13.720]  I won't say why, but there's a reason.
[01:49:15.281 --> 01:49:18.162]  Well, we know a lot of the experimentation is admitted on the veterans.
[01:49:20.423 --> 01:49:23.505]  And I've even had family that was in admitted experimentation.
[01:49:23.545 --> 01:49:25.166]  It wasn't mind control, but it was chemical.
[01:49:26.537 --> 01:49:28.057]  And they've just done everything to the troops.
[01:49:28.077 --> 01:49:28.477]  It's so sick.
[01:49:28.537 --> 01:49:30.378]  That's why they said they love them all day on the news.
[01:49:30.418 --> 01:49:31.138]  No, they hate you.
[01:49:31.618 --> 01:49:35.739]  The cowards that run things absolutely hate men and women who are willing to put their life on the line.
[01:49:35.759 --> 01:49:36.899]  They hate honorable people.
[01:49:37.219 --> 01:49:40.100]  Even if some of these wars were dishonorable, the people are honorable.
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:46.502]  And that's why they disarm the troops whenever they're around them, because they're total filth.
[01:49:47.122 --> 01:49:52.623]  I'd have to look into that, but if you research, there's been a lot of lawsuits over MKUltra, MKNaomi.
[01:49:54.184 --> 01:49:58.447]  I would just Google lawyer wins case for secret testing on vets.
[01:49:59.647 --> 01:50:03.090]  And then you'll see the hundreds of lawyers that have won cases for that.
[01:50:04.130 --> 01:50:16.218]  And generally, if you were tested on or messed with, you will then find out that there was a whole group of other people that were, and that you won't have to re-engineer or reverse engineer and investigate what happened to you.
[01:50:16.798 --> 01:50:18.879]  You can then basically find out you're a cookie cutter.
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:21.001]  That's one major weakness of the globalist.
[01:50:22.452 --> 01:50:29.074]  It's one of their strengths too, because people ignore it, but if you know the weakness, it can be exploited big time, is it's all cookie cutter.
[01:50:30.614 --> 01:50:37.316]  And they do all this stuff basically in set parameters, because it's such a large scale operation.
[01:50:38.056 --> 01:50:47.799]  And so if you'll simply research the specifics and then research other cases like yours, it'll be the same names nine times out of ten that did it to you.
[01:50:48.638 --> 01:50:54.282]  But it's their religion to test things on good men and women and to hurt people.
[01:50:54.743 --> 01:50:58.165]  It's their religion to cull the population.
[01:50:58.546 --> 01:50:59.386]  They get off on it.
[01:50:59.406 --> 01:51:09.855]  They love going to a shopping mall and seeing dying and sick kids everywhere and, you know, kids with chemotherapy bags on them and people dying and unhealthy and seeing the symptoms of what they've done to them.

[01:53:39.361 --> 01:53:52.450]  So I found out the other day that at Guns80.com, a lot of people don't get the Ghost AR-15 rifle kits because they're afraid that they won't be able to do the machining work required to drill out and make ready the lower.
[01:53:52.690 --> 01:53:56.813]  Well listen, guys, gals, I am not that good of a machinist, I promise you.
[01:53:57.073 --> 01:54:03.417]  But I was able to take a drill press with an X-Y table and knock this out in about 45 minutes and in all honesty, mine looks really good.
[01:54:03.717 --> 01:54:05.498]  Go get yours, don't be afraid, it's easy.
[01:54:05.558 --> 01:54:05.878]  Guns80.com.
[01:54:05.898 --> 01:54:06.639]  Go to Guns80.com now.
[01:54:13.581 --> 01:54:14.145]  He's gone
[01:54:40.894 --> 01:54:42.474]  We're here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:54:42.574 --> 01:54:42.995]  to 2 p.m.
[01:54:43.035 --> 01:54:47.375]  Central.
[01:54:50.896 --> 01:54:58.838]  Coming up the next hour after I continue with calls, I'm gonna get into something that was announced yesterday that I mentioned some, but it should have covered more, and it ties into a whole bunch of other key news.
[01:54:58.858 --> 01:55:02.159]  And I lost the cover sheet to this.
[01:55:03.274 --> 01:55:14.120]  This original article out of the Washington Post Foreign Affairs Journal, where two years ago they said they were, quote, legalizing propaganda by the CIA domestically against the American people.
[01:55:14.981 --> 01:55:16.182]  There's the headline, the U.S.
[01:55:16.222 --> 01:55:19.443]  repeals propaganda ban, spreads government-made news to Americans.
[01:55:20.024 --> 01:55:27.308]  Now Obama has come out with an executive order saying they're going to have psychiatrists and psych warfare experts target us for our own good.
[01:55:28.589 --> 01:55:32.311]  Now the reason they're doing that is they're having to hide it in plain view because it's so illegal.
[01:55:34.215 --> 01:55:37.316]  It's still illegal in the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and common sense.
[01:55:37.336 --> 01:55:41.098]  I don't care if they pass a law saying child molestation is legal next week.
[01:55:41.458 --> 01:55:44.939]  It's still illegal because my heart says so, common sense says so.
[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:51.882]  And their own people don't want to do this, so they're putting it out in the news to try to condition everyone.
[01:55:53.223 --> 01:55:56.604]  And if you can, we did a news report two years ago, it's actually in the article,
[01:55:59.861 --> 01:56:03.824]  Pentagon promises to stop lying because of drugs in that produced piece.
[01:56:03.864 --> 01:56:13.110]  We have a whole video for the Pentagon there, but there's a produced piece where I just play clips where they promise to quote stop lying by being embedded in every news department in the country.
[01:56:13.870 --> 01:56:16.192]  That's what this psych warfare takeover is.
[01:56:16.312 --> 01:56:17.653]  I mean this is the next level.
[01:56:18.713 --> 01:56:25.358]  Remember in Europe they arrest you if you criticize open borders or if you try to protest anything basically.
[01:56:28.032 --> 01:56:31.997]  There it is, Drudge Force's Establishment to Admit Culture of Lies.
[01:56:32.698 --> 01:56:37.945]  That video ties in to all of this.
[01:56:37.965 --> 01:56:40.449]  And it's a big deal.
[01:56:41.790 --> 01:56:45.155]  I'm gonna go to Jameson in Virginia, and of course,
[01:56:46.838 --> 01:56:49.560]  I just wanted to say I really appreciate what you said to Pierce Morgan.
[01:57:11.166 --> 01:57:14.027]  I think you said what a lot of governors wanted to say.
[01:57:14.047 --> 01:57:18.387]  1776 will commence again if they come for our firearms.
[01:57:19.348 --> 01:57:24.248]  And that's a beautiful rifle y'all are giving, well, you know, raffling off.
[01:57:24.808 --> 01:57:27.329]  Some domestic terrorists will love that.
[01:57:28.389 --> 01:57:37.511]  And I think a lot of people need to start looking at Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.
[01:57:37.591 --> 01:57:39.891]  They're the only ones who really stand for the Second Amendment.
[01:57:40.641 --> 01:57:41.562]  I don't think so.
[01:58:00.413 --> 01:58:01.794]  And that's the most important thing.
[01:58:02.034 --> 01:58:05.637]  If they get rid of our firearms, it won't be America anymore.
[01:58:05.897 --> 01:58:11.961]  Well, that's their plan, and they're moving to do it, but we're actually winning that fight, and if we win one fight, we win them all.
[01:58:11.981 --> 01:58:13.042]  That's why they're so desperate.
[01:58:13.362 --> 01:58:13.983]  God bless you.
[01:58:14.283 --> 01:58:20.527]  Believe me, if they're getting ready to stage or wind up some crazy to have some massacre, then try to tell us collectively it's our guilt.
[01:58:21.108 --> 01:58:23.430]  As if it's our fault that somebody else did something bad.
[01:58:24.190 --> 01:58:29.314]  Look, I'm not attacking Trump for looking like he's an orangutan, you know, with weird red blonde hair.
[01:58:30.375 --> 01:58:32.837]  A cross between an orangutan and one of those troll dolls.
[01:58:33.537 --> 01:58:38.401]  The reason I say that is he made fun of Rand Paul and said he was goofy looking and ugly.
[01:58:39.061 --> 01:58:41.703]  And I really don't think Donald Trump has any talk here.
[01:58:41.743 --> 01:58:42.724]  I've never called him ugly.
[01:58:43.324 --> 01:58:44.485]  I think he's goofy looking.
[01:58:45.046 --> 01:58:47.027]  I don't care what somebody looks like, it's how they act.
[01:58:47.488 --> 01:58:51.351]  So if he wants to get in that sandbox, let's talk about it, he looks like a weirdo.
[01:58:52.091 --> 01:58:57.999]  He looks like he bleached gray hair and then turned it blonde.
[01:58:58.079 --> 01:58:59.481]  And he looks like a giant orangutan.
[01:59:00.825 --> 01:59:07.771]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[02:00:40.658 --> 02:00:42.019]  I guess we've been on 26 hours.

[02:00:54.615 --> 02:00:55.677]  We did sell out last night.
[02:00:55.697 --> 02:00:57.680]  We learned the truck is on the way with a smaller shipment.
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:00:59.522]  The full shipment's about three weeks out.
[02:01:01.243 --> 02:01:02.744]  I'll tell you all about that coming up.
[02:01:02.764 --> 02:01:10.570]  The toll-free number to call and make a donation or buy products, and then the profit goes towards the money bomb, is 888-253-3139.
[02:01:10.590 --> 02:01:12.351]  888-253-3139.
[02:01:13.311 --> 02:01:16.774]  We're taking phone calls right now.
[02:01:16.874 --> 02:01:18.015]  Sue in Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:01:20.096 --> 02:01:20.677]  Hi, Alex.
[02:01:20.997 --> 02:01:27.962]  I just wanted to call in about vaccines and humanitarian rates being used to diminish quality of life.
[02:01:29.341 --> 02:01:31.462]  And I've been researching a story.
[02:01:32.662 --> 02:01:38.084]  It's on global research, water barons and mega banks to take over world's water.
[02:01:39.424 --> 02:01:52.548]  And this is basically humanitarian water rights are being used and they were used in Buenos Aires, 1993, where they ushered in three times population and immigration, Russian water rights.
[02:01:53.448 --> 02:01:57.409]  Then they created high inflation and the corporate sued to recover costs.
[02:01:58.363 --> 02:02:09.138]  And then the settlement was done on them capturing water rights and this is why we're set up for QE to create inflation and TPP for the lawsuit to commence.
[02:02:09.949 --> 02:02:16.112]  So humanitarian water rights are, you know, this is about meters going on houses on water?
[02:02:16.252 --> 02:02:17.012]  Absolutely.
[02:02:17.092 --> 02:02:29.238]  I mean there's some real water problems, there's some real overuse, there's some waste, but all that's tertiary, that's side issue, to the admission of the IMF and World Bank, the globalists, call it blue gold.
[02:02:29.898 --> 02:02:32.879]  And they are artificially getting control of it worldwide.
[02:02:33.239 --> 02:02:34.720]  They're turning it into a commodity.
[02:02:34.740 --> 02:02:43.062]  And they are going to be jacking up prices absolutely massively, putting meters on all your wells.
[02:02:43.082 --> 02:02:46.844]  They're even saying England doesn't have enough water yet when it's just full of water.
[02:02:46.864 --> 02:02:49.485]  And the EPA is making all the announcements.
[02:02:49.545 --> 02:02:56.367]  It's a grab of resources artificially to create scarcity to end the industrial world as we know it.
[02:02:58.171 --> 02:03:13.756]  Correct, and the other thing that they were going to do was the water meters, but then they're going to create these infrastructure banks so they have private property and private profits in water and then the rest of us... Absolutely, they're all exempt.
[02:03:14.276 --> 02:03:19.257]  They'll be the stewards of the water and then you will have to pay them whatever they want for it.
[02:03:20.478 --> 02:03:21.738]  Right, this is a big story.
[02:03:21.818 --> 02:03:24.039]  It goes on about infrastructure banks and
[02:03:24.938 --> 02:03:26.700]  How they bought off the Union.
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:31.725]  So anybody in the Union, you know, forget the Union.
[02:03:31.846 --> 02:03:33.848]  I've seen that Global Research article.
[02:03:33.868 --> 02:03:34.749]  Give us the headline again.
[02:03:36.531 --> 02:03:38.393]  It is Global Research.
[02:03:38.673 --> 02:03:44.700]  The exact article is something about water barons, mega banks, and world water.
[02:03:45.336 --> 02:03:50.657]  Yeah, we can just search globalresearch.ca and then water banks, world barons, and it will come up.
[02:03:50.677 --> 02:03:51.377]  I've seen that article.
[02:03:51.697 --> 02:03:52.558]  And that's dead on.
[02:03:52.618 --> 02:03:59.239]  I mean, I went to big smart growth conferences in Dallas and Austin in 96, 97, 98.
[02:03:59.939 --> 02:04:04.460]  And I'd go, you know, this is run by big mega banks to take property.
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:05.420]  And they'd go, of course it is.
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:06.201]  Get out of our way.
[02:04:06.221 --> 02:04:08.601]  I mean, there was no debating it.
[02:04:08.821 --> 02:04:11.982]  It was all about how we're going to screw everybody, get invested now.
[02:04:13.002 --> 02:04:28.985]  How we're going to take people's property, ranchers' property, say it's for a golden chic warbler, a cave bug, turn around ten years later, take the restrictions off, make billions just in Austin alone, and, you know, have a lot be a million dollars when they took it from the farmer for one cent on the dollar for five hundred dollars.
[02:04:29.465 --> 02:04:30.765]  And you did find the headline.
[02:04:30.785 --> 02:04:31.285]  There it is.
[02:04:31.725 --> 02:04:32.825]  I will put it back on screen.
[02:04:32.845 --> 02:04:33.205]  Thank you.
[02:04:33.466 --> 02:04:37.146]  The new water barons, Wall Street megabanks, are buying up the world's water.
[02:04:37.206 --> 02:04:38.346]  Thank you so much, ma'am.
[02:04:38.786 --> 02:04:39.587]  Excellent points.
[02:04:39.767 --> 02:04:40.107]  Sue.
[02:04:40.927 --> 02:04:41.267]  Eileen.
[02:04:42.487 --> 02:04:45.229]  James, Mark, Timon and others.
[02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:48.872]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:04:49.893 --> 02:04:55.237]  I'm Alex Jones on a collision course with the New World Order.
[02:04:55.717 --> 02:04:57.999]  Join me now in the epic battle.
[02:04:58.700 --> 02:05:00.141]  It's great to be involved in.
[02:05:00.721 --> 02:05:04.944]  It's better than being in the middle of the road as a spectator and being run over.
[02:05:05.345 --> 02:05:08.267]  This is the animating contest for liberty.
[02:05:10.885 --> 02:05:13.025]  Kit Daniels, Infowars.com.
[02:05:13.565 --> 02:05:18.026]  President Obama has ordered the federal government to start conducting behavior experiments on U.S.
[02:05:18.046 --> 02:05:18.506]  citizens.
[02:05:18.866 --> 02:05:19.687]  You heard that right.
[02:05:20.087 --> 02:05:28.888]  The new executive order commands federal agencies to condition people into doing whatever the government wants them to do, effectively turning we the people into lab rats running through a maze for a piece of cheese.
[02:05:29.448 --> 02:05:39.190]  The feds are going to start hiring so-called behavioral scientists to encourage, meaning brainwash, people into say, signing up for Obamacare, or even turning into their guns at a local gun buyback program.
[02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:44.731]  So basically, the Obama administration wants to take the freedom of choice away from the individual and give it to the government.
[02:05:45.191 --> 02:05:46.872]  That doesn't sound like freedom now, does it?
[02:05:47.352 --> 02:05:52.833]  Freedom is the right of the people to choose how to live their lives as long as their conduct doesn't infringe on the rights of others to do the same.
[02:05:53.293 --> 02:05:57.314]  The Obama administration, however, wants to brainwash you into surrendering that basic liberty.
[02:05:57.735 --> 02:06:00.595]  They want you to be a lemming who jumps off the cliff when they say jump.
[02:06:00.955 --> 02:06:03.136]  But you have the power to decide not to be a slave.
[02:06:03.436 --> 02:06:06.737]  For more reports, check out InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.

[02:07:09.716 --> 02:07:11.659]  It's now more clear than ever.
[02:07:11.859 --> 02:07:15.383]  The Globalists have launched a planetary destabilization plan.
[02:07:15.663 --> 02:07:19.264]  Here at the InfoWars operation, we hope and pray that this is not the case.
[02:07:19.544 --> 02:07:23.385]  But the signs of things deteriorating around the world are unmistakable.
[02:07:23.565 --> 02:07:30.187]  For many years, I've been working with MyPatriotSupply, and we have now developed a private label called InfoWars Select.
[02:07:30.347 --> 02:07:35.089]  Look, it's important to have firearms and water filtration during a collapse, but you've also got to have food.

[02:08:15.410 --> 02:08:18.933]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.

[02:08:39.381 --> 02:09:00.318]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, we'll continue to cover world news, take your phone calls and get to more clips from the GOP debate last night, from the drug war to Trump saying this is a country where we speak English, not Spanish, and more.
[02:09:02.483 --> 02:09:08.994]  But I wanted to get Larry Klayman on for this segment and the next, and I really appreciate the constitutional lawyer joining us.
[02:09:09.314 --> 02:09:15.344]  We'll be talking to him in a moment about huge developments on his groundbreaking suit against the NSA.
[02:09:15.825 --> 02:09:16.786]  That's coming up in a moment.
[02:09:17.734 --> 02:09:20.636]  We are in the final two hours right now.
[02:09:20.677 --> 02:09:25.360]  We've got an hour and 50 minutes left in this 28-hour live broadcast.

[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:08.287]  And to be a platform for great people like Larry Klayman and Ron Paul and so many others to come on and to promote basic ideas that made this country great.

[02:10:12.633 --> 02:10:13.653]  It ends at the end of the day.
[02:10:13.993 --> 02:10:35.106]  At the end of the show, we're going to end 15% off the high-quality Survival Shield Nacin Ionine, 30% off Suprametal Vitality, 20% off Brain Forge, 20% off Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, 20% off the Total Body Cleanse, Deep Cleanse, 15% off Secret 12, Methylcobalamin, Vitamin B12, 15% off Oxy Powder, and so much more.
[02:10:36.607 --> 02:10:47.432]  And all the profits from the sales go towards the syndication of the broadcast, go towards the TV satellite, go towards reporters and being able to fly them around to cover big events.
[02:10:47.472 --> 02:10:48.552]  You see what we've done.
[02:10:48.953 --> 02:10:50.433]  You see what your support has done.
[02:10:50.733 --> 02:10:54.215]  I haven't done a fundraiser in three years because we didn't need the money.
[02:10:56.136 --> 02:11:00.618]  Now, because of the economy and because of so many things happening, to be able
[02:11:01.912 --> 02:11:04.156]  To launch to this next level, we need a million dollars.
[02:11:04.196 --> 02:11:05.137]  That sounds like a lot.
[02:11:05.197 --> 02:11:07.802]  The satellite and closed captioning alone for a year is.
[02:11:10.614 --> 02:11:18.135]  $400,000.
[02:11:10.754 --> 02:11:18.135]  You got it all together to really be sitting pretty and comfortable and really be able to expand in the face of this global onslaught.
[02:11:18.175 --> 02:11:19.236]  Two, three million would be great.
[02:11:19.516 --> 02:11:22.956]  But a million, we can do it on a Texas shoestring budget.
[02:11:22.996 --> 02:11:23.936]  So we're getting close.
[02:11:24.656 --> 02:11:26.937]  Infowars.com forward slash money mom.
[02:11:27.557 --> 02:11:28.697]  Call your friends and family.
[02:11:29.237 --> 02:11:33.778]  Tell them if you want to promote the First Amendment, if you want to promote freedom, get behind Infowars.
[02:11:34.078 --> 02:11:39.119]  We don't take your money at gunpoint like the IRS does and give it to NPR or MSNBC.
[02:11:40.649 --> 02:11:41.730]  We are listener-supported.
[02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:43.392]  We only ask for money every few years.
[02:11:43.892 --> 02:11:45.854]  We sell high-quality products and have sponsors.
[02:11:46.514 --> 02:11:50.478]  But advertising, internet-wise and in radio, as everyone knows, is gone.
[02:11:51.239 --> 02:11:53.881]  The economy is in a deep recession, going into depression.
[02:11:54.381 --> 02:11:56.844]  That's why the Obama administration tells us it's all great.
[02:11:57.484 --> 02:12:03.610]  So that's why, if you want to see us continue and expand, when folks are really ready to hear the truth, now is the time.
[02:12:03.650 --> 02:12:05.311]  And I want to thank everybody that has contributed.
[02:12:05.592 --> 02:12:06.592]  You're having a huge effect.
[02:12:08.325 --> 02:12:10.587]  Larry Klayman is the founder of Judicial Watch.
[02:12:10.647 --> 02:12:14.189]  Larry Klayman now has Freedom Watch USA.org.
[02:12:14.649 --> 02:12:17.311]  Larry Klayman is the guy that got the impeachment of Clinton going.
[02:12:17.952 --> 02:12:21.534]  Larry Klayman has engaged in hundreds of major coups against tyranny.
[02:12:21.554 --> 02:12:28.539]  And he's one of the most demonized, reviled, hated people by the authoritarian left and controlled right wing in this country.
[02:12:29.531 --> 02:12:31.853]  And we have a new headline out of the Washington Times.
[02:12:31.993 --> 02:12:34.654]  Judge allows claimant's suit against the NSA to proceed.
[02:12:35.135 --> 02:12:39.257]  He won, a few years ago, the ban on bulk data collection.
[02:12:39.838 --> 02:12:42.800]  Now we saw the headline that a court had overturned that, but did they really?
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:44.561]  He's a constitutional lawyer.
[02:12:44.921 --> 02:12:47.423]  He can walk us through this today.
[02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:52.223]  But then I want to get into the election, what he predicted.
[02:12:52.243 --> 02:12:55.005]  I remember 10 years ago, I thought he'd gone a little too far.
[02:12:55.025 --> 02:12:56.566]  I'm just admitting when I'm wrong.
[02:12:56.886 --> 02:13:02.290]  They want to set up a caliphate to invade Europe and the rest of the Middle East and put radical Islam in charge.
[02:13:02.851 --> 02:13:03.991]  Now we see that happening.
[02:13:04.412 --> 02:13:09.896]  So Larry Klayman, one of the most accurate, smartest guys we've ever interviewed, joins us till the bottom of the hour.
[02:13:10.296 --> 02:13:22.758]  Someone tried to shut up and let him go over this latest NSA situation and the two other points I raised, but it's a key for everyone to go to FreedomWatchUSA.org and to spread the word about the website and to support what he's doing.
[02:13:23.078 --> 02:13:26.119]  He's also a weekly columnist for WND.com.
[02:13:26.399 --> 02:13:27.599]  So Larry, thank you for joining us.
[02:13:28.839 --> 02:13:31.660]  Alex, thank you very much for that nice introduction.
[02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.160]  I like your comment about the controlled right.
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:35.580]  That's a great phrase.
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:37.681]  You mean the establishment?
[02:13:37.821 --> 02:13:38.141]  Yes, sir.
[02:13:40.273 --> 02:13:41.533]  Well, they're so right, they're wrong.
[02:13:42.173 --> 02:13:44.534]  In any event, let me tell you what's happened here, Alex.
[02:13:44.554 --> 02:13:45.354]  You're absolutely right.
[02:13:46.914 --> 02:13:58.377]  Over almost three years ago, we filed a lawsuit against the National Security Agency for getting all of our telephonic metadata, our communications, not just phone calls, but our location.
[02:13:59.457 --> 02:14:04.378]  Every aspect of what we do is being monitored by this National Security Agency.
[02:14:04.398 --> 02:14:05.938]  And of course, we know that President Obama
[02:14:06.693 --> 02:14:07.273]  We're good to go.
[02:14:36.425 --> 02:14:44.852]  And he entered a preliminary injunction on December 16, 2013 against the NSA and against everyone that's dealing with it, including Obama.
[02:14:45.752 --> 02:14:54.800]  It went up to the appellate court in Washington, and the Justice Department, of course run by Eric Holder at the time, did everything it could to delay the appeal.
[02:14:55.881 --> 02:14:58.222]  Judge Leon deferred to the government.
[02:14:58.683 --> 02:15:01.205]  He stayed the preliminary injunction until the appeal would be heard.
[02:15:01.925 --> 02:15:03.967]  He anticipated it would be over in about six months.
[02:15:04.867 --> 02:15:15.536]  But instead, the appellate court sat on this for two years and issued an opinion several weeks ago saying that we hadn't proved standing.
[02:15:15.896 --> 02:15:20.740]  This is what courts use when they want to try to sidestep issues, that I wasn't really injured.
[02:15:21.781 --> 02:15:23.603]  They didn't rule on the constitutional issues.
[02:15:24.063 --> 02:15:26.345]  Judge Leon had made an unequivocal finding.
[02:15:27.028 --> 02:15:31.251]  That what the NSA and Obama and others were doing violated our Fourth Amendment.
[02:15:31.491 --> 02:15:34.593]  They're just claiming you hadn't been harmed, so you couldn't bring it in.
[02:15:34.773 --> 02:15:35.914]  I mean, a total cop-out.
[02:15:36.534 --> 02:15:38.876]  Cop-out, because we know that they've gotten everybody's records.
[02:15:38.936 --> 02:15:41.177]  Just the very fact that they have them is harm.
[02:15:41.217 --> 02:15:48.202]  In fact, there's case law from the federal appellate court itself, which says that when you violate the Constitution, you don't even have to prove harm.
[02:15:48.262 --> 02:15:52.464]  Well, if I take your mail out of your mailbox, it's a federal offense because I stole your private data.
[02:15:53.405 --> 02:15:54.746]  Right, it doesn't even mean you have to open it.
[02:15:55.646 --> 02:15:56.407]  So in this case,
[02:15:57.276 --> 02:15:58.477]  They sent it back to Leon.
[02:15:59.457 --> 02:16:04.200]  And Leon said to us, he said, look, make a few changes in your original complaint.
[02:16:05.161 --> 02:16:08.322]  They also said that maybe we didn't sue the right Verizon company.
[02:16:08.783 --> 02:16:09.143]  We did.
[02:16:09.643 --> 02:16:11.544]  And the government has had to admit that sin.
[02:16:12.024 --> 02:16:23.651]  But go ahead and get this other Verizon company, Verizon Business Network Services, which the appellate court used as an excuse not to affirm the preliminary injunction of Judge Leon.
[02:16:24.246 --> 02:16:27.007]  So we went out and we got a plaintiff with Verizon Business Services.
[02:16:27.647 --> 02:16:31.267]  So we mooted out the whole issue, as lawyers said, and we're back in front of Leon.
[02:16:31.808 --> 02:16:33.468]  And Leon says he wants to move quickly.
[02:16:33.928 --> 02:16:35.908]  He wants to enter a preliminary injunction.
[02:16:36.609 --> 02:16:48.771]  He's basically telling the appellate court, yeah, I'll do what you say, but I'm going to enter an injunction because I believe that every day there's a constitutional violation of Americans' rights is one day too much.
[02:16:49.411 --> 02:16:52.972]  And we have an oral argument now set for October 8th, just in a few weeks.
[02:16:53.883 --> 02:17:00.428]  And I'm confident the judge will enter a new preliminary injunction and set a precedent that this kind of thing can't happen.
[02:17:00.448 --> 02:17:22.166]  And what's really important here, Alex, is that our so-called government, and I emphasize so-called because we really don't have a government, they're not our government, they're the government of themselves, of the establishment, both Republican and Democrat, that this cannot be permitted and this will set a precedent and Judge Leon will retain jurisdiction
[02:17:22.737 --> 02:17:24.117]  To monitor what they're doing.
[02:17:24.157 --> 02:17:28.458]  He can haul them in anytime he wants to see if they're obeying the Fourth Amendment.
[02:17:29.178 --> 02:17:33.699]  Because without that court supervision, the NSA will continue to do whatever it wants.
[02:17:34.299 --> 02:17:36.480]  And it's not just the NSA, they work with the CIA.
[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:43.701]  And the CIA, contrary to what they've been telling people that they only operate overseas, has been operating domestically too.
[02:17:43.741 --> 02:17:44.642]  They all work together.
[02:17:44.662 --> 02:17:49.663]  So we live in what Judge Leon found in his order of December 16, 2013.
[02:17:51.733 --> 02:17:57.897]  In an almost Orwellian state of Big Brother, where they gather dirt on any of us, and all of us.
[02:17:58.858 --> 02:18:02.941]  We know that they're gathering dirt on judges, on congressmen, on senators.
[02:18:03.001 --> 02:18:04.281]  Probably have dirt on Obama.
[02:18:04.322 --> 02:18:05.803]  They probably blackmail him too.
[02:18:06.143 --> 02:18:06.843]  And that's the irony.
[02:18:07.464 --> 02:18:09.505]  They let Obama do his black Muslim thing.
[02:18:09.965 --> 02:18:15.329]  Okay, he can go off and sign these ridiculous agreements that undercut Israel and the United States.
[02:18:15.979 --> 02:18:19.401]  He can walk around with his ring that says, my only God is Allah.
[02:18:19.882 --> 02:18:29.988]  He can forget about persecution towards Christians in the Far East, in the Middle East, because, in fact, he's Muslim and, you know, tacitly or directly approves of it.
[02:18:30.168 --> 02:18:30.868]  Go do your thing.
[02:18:31.369 --> 02:18:32.550]  But we're in control.
[02:18:32.850 --> 02:18:36.352]  We, the intelligence agencies of this country, we call the ultimate shot.
[02:18:37.072 --> 02:18:39.074]  And we're here for power and probably money.
[02:18:39.994 --> 02:18:41.655]  And that's what we face right now.
[02:18:41.695 --> 02:18:42.536]  And it helps explain
[02:18:43.559 --> 02:19:06.478]  Why Chief Justice John Roberts may have flipped on Obamacare because we know that they have his data and perhaps they blackmailed him and if they can blackmail him they can blackmail any of us and it keeps us from fighting back so this is the kind of world that we live in and that's why I made reference to your you know the
[02:19:07.196 --> 02:19:09.137]  Right, I forgot the exact phrase that you used.
[02:19:09.157 --> 02:19:10.117]  The controlled right!
[02:19:10.157 --> 02:19:14.738]  I mean, they're intimidated, they're dominated, they are lapdogs of the Democrats.
[02:19:15.038 --> 02:19:25.181]  Right, and that's why Trump is doing so well, because all these people can get up on the stage, they can say whatever they want, but in the end, they don't do anything, because they're controlled.
[02:19:25.921 --> 02:19:30.702]  And maybe Trump's out there, maybe he's insulting people, I don't approve of that, you don't either, I'm sure.
[02:19:31.423 --> 02:19:32.943]  But they figure, hey, what do we have to lose?
[02:19:33.755 --> 02:19:37.416]  Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose, says Janice Joplin.
[02:19:37.736 --> 02:19:38.536]  It is insane.
[02:19:38.856 --> 02:19:40.316]  You're a smart constitutional lawyer.
[02:19:40.376 --> 02:19:41.697]  You've operated at the highest levels.
[02:19:41.737 --> 02:19:44.397]  You've gotten the president impeached in the House, not in the Senate.
[02:19:44.577 --> 02:19:45.758]  You've got him indicted in the House.
[02:19:46.458 --> 02:19:51.059]  I mean, it seems like, and I've studied history, people didn't used to be this reckless in the power structure.
[02:19:51.079 --> 02:19:52.619]  I'm not even lionizing them.
[02:19:53.079 --> 02:19:59.160]  It seems like the establishment doesn't realize when they get rid of checks and balances, they get rid of their own protections.
[02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:01.741]  They're burning down our own house.
[02:20:02.501 --> 02:20:11.107]  Why would the elite want to bring in totalitarianism when historically it's the most dangerous for the establishment in the midterm?
[02:20:12.428 --> 02:20:12.748]  That's right.
[02:20:12.788 --> 02:20:13.569]  Here's the irony here.
[02:20:14.890 --> 02:20:20.614]  Is that the left is more in favor of curtailing the NSA than the right.
[02:20:21.294 --> 02:20:22.395]  You saw Mitch McConnell.
[02:20:22.976 --> 02:20:24.336]  You saw Lindsey Graham.
[02:20:25.057 --> 02:20:26.398]  You saw John McCain.
[02:20:27.239 --> 02:20:27.679]  Senators.
[02:20:27.739 --> 02:20:29.660]  You see Congressman Peter King.
[02:20:30.341 --> 02:20:31.882]  All Republicans and others.
[02:20:32.509 --> 02:20:33.690]  Saying the NSA is great.
[02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:35.331]  Best thing since sliced bread.
[02:20:36.051 --> 02:20:39.614]  Let them spy on all of us because they're protecting us against terrorism.
[02:20:39.654 --> 02:20:40.134]  Well, you know what?
[02:20:40.414 --> 02:20:46.218]  Judge Leon found they hadn't stopped one terrorist attack with their so-called surveillance programs.
[02:20:46.318 --> 02:20:47.899]  Look at what's happening in Europe right now.
[02:20:47.919 --> 02:20:53.202]  We're 14 years after 9-11 and now they admit one out of 20 people is a jihadi.
[02:20:53.562 --> 02:20:54.423]  They're bragging about it.
[02:20:54.583 --> 02:20:55.303]  You're a smart guy.
[02:20:55.323 --> 02:20:56.124]  I have a lot of contacts.
[02:20:56.524 --> 02:20:57.165]  What is this
[02:20:58.265 --> 02:21:11.492]  Obama backing ISIS, backing Al-Qaeda in Syria, 50 intelligence operatives have gone public, the former head of defense intelligence, the general, goes public, says we were ordered to do this, the deputy head of the CIA comes out, says there should be an investigation.
[02:21:11.832 --> 02:21:18.456]  Is that not a good sign that the Pentagon does not want to back Saudi Arabia and Al-Qaeda in their takeover of the Middle East?
[02:21:21.157 --> 02:21:26.700]  I think it's a sign that the Pentagon, and reference has been made recently to this, has bowed down
[02:21:27.489 --> 02:21:28.170]  We're good to go.
[02:21:44.929 --> 02:21:48.472]  Like General MacArthur with the Korean War when he wanted to take care of China.
[02:21:48.892 --> 02:21:54.016]  Or General Patton when he wanted to get rid of the Soviet Union when we had an opportunity after World War II.
[02:21:54.396 --> 02:21:55.137]  They've been fired.
[02:21:55.177 --> 02:21:56.057]  They've been shown the door.
[02:21:56.478 --> 02:21:57.659]  So who runs our military?
[02:21:58.119 --> 02:21:58.579]  Yes men.
[02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:03.963]  So if the President does not have our interests at heart, they're not going to go against him.
[02:22:04.384 --> 02:22:10.629]  You know, maybe Obama's pushing to the point that maybe someday they will wage a coup in this country.
[02:22:10.669 --> 02:22:13.711]  I'm not advocating that, but I know that some of these retired generals
[02:22:14.486 --> 02:22:16.347]  Uh, and admirals have talked about it.
[02:22:16.667 --> 02:22:17.107]  I know that.
[02:22:17.687 --> 02:22:19.147]  It's been in the public domain.
[02:22:19.667 --> 02:22:26.449]  Because Obama, and I'll say it straight up because no one else will, you will, Obama is a Muslim through and through.
[02:22:26.469 --> 02:22:29.570]  Obama sympathizes with a Muslim caliphate.
[02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:33.471]  Obama simplifies, sympathizes with the mullahs in Tehran.
[02:22:33.951 --> 02:22:37.072]  He sympathizes with the radicals in the Far East.
[02:22:37.152 --> 02:22:37.672]  And that's why
[02:22:38.450 --> 02:22:39.970]  He never holds any of them accountable.
[02:22:40.151 --> 02:22:42.211]  He doesn't sympathize with Christians and Jews.
[02:22:42.631 --> 02:22:44.332]  He sympathizes with his own people.
[02:22:44.932 --> 02:22:46.472]  And that's why these things are happening.
[02:22:46.553 --> 02:22:49.373]  And it's time that someone called it like it is.
[02:22:50.094 --> 02:23:02.597]  And that's why, you know Alex, a couple years ago I was in front of the World War II Memorial and I was saying tongue-in-cheek, okay, it was a satire, but it rang true and it rings true now more than ever.
[02:23:02.617 --> 02:23:05.758]  I said, President Obama, get up off your knees.
[02:23:06.539 --> 02:23:07.459]  Put the Quran down.
[02:23:08.148 --> 02:23:08.649]  He's not incompetent.
[02:23:08.729 --> 02:23:11.312]  It's not that he doesn't know what he's doing.
[02:23:11.372 --> 02:23:12.534]  It's not that he's weak.
[02:23:25.842 --> 02:23:27.802]  He is furthering a Muslim caliphate.
[02:23:27.822 --> 02:23:28.562]  Those are his people.
[02:23:28.582 --> 02:23:32.623]  Well, Larry, I would hear you, because you've been coming on the show for 16, 17, 18 years.
[02:23:32.643 --> 02:23:37.044]  I mean, I remember having you on like in 1996 and stuff when you were really going after the Clintons.
[02:23:37.244 --> 02:23:38.084]  So I guess 20 years.
[02:23:38.764 --> 02:23:43.065]  But I would hear you, and I respected you, and I'd hear you on Glenn Beck six, seven years ago.
[02:23:43.145 --> 02:23:43.625]  I would hear you.
[02:23:43.885 --> 02:23:44.565]  You'd come on here.
[02:23:44.965 --> 02:23:46.226]  You'd go off into caliphates.
[02:23:46.246 --> 02:23:47.306]  They're going to take over Europe.
[02:23:47.346 --> 02:23:47.926]  This, plan that.
[02:23:48.266 --> 02:23:49.866]  And I'd go, come on, that's Islamophobic.
[02:23:49.926 --> 02:23:51.066]  Not all the Muslims are radical.
[02:23:51.566 --> 02:23:54.107]  And I've had to say on air, one of the few things I've been wrong about
[02:23:54.847 --> 02:23:58.230]  Is when you started saying he was a secret radical Muslim and planned this takeover.
[02:23:58.770 --> 02:24:09.379]  When I look at what he's doing with our allies throwing him out in Egypt and putting in all the radicals and what's happening in Syria and everywhere and then his cousin Odinga and the funding of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:24:10.220 --> 02:24:12.941]  I look at it, none of it's good for American interest.
[02:24:13.342 --> 02:24:15.262]  None of it's good for anybody's interest.
[02:24:15.703 --> 02:24:17.363]  Not even Muslim's interest.
[02:24:17.423 --> 02:24:20.885]  He really is backing head chopping loons.
[02:24:21.706 --> 02:24:26.508]  And they said when he spoke in Cairo, when he was first in office, that the Muslims were freaked out.
[02:24:26.548 --> 02:24:32.311]  He spoke better than a priest, you know, better than a scribe, better than...
[02:24:33.897 --> 02:24:38.900]  A religious leader, and I guess to look at it, that might be the case.
[02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:43.823]  How do you think then, since I guess you're being proven right, what does he want to pull off?
[02:24:43.843 --> 02:24:45.904]  I mean, what's the end game?
[02:24:45.944 --> 02:24:47.465]  To become the Mahdi or something?
[02:24:48.746 --> 02:24:49.446]  It's not funny.
[02:24:50.487 --> 02:24:51.528]  Let me back up a little bit.
[02:24:51.548 --> 02:24:56.851]  Somebody sent me a video recently, a Muslim, about Obama in his own words.
[02:24:57.731 --> 02:24:59.172]  You know, boasting that he's a Muslim.
[02:24:59.432 --> 02:25:02.915]  It's on our website, FreedomWatchUSA.org.
[02:25:02.935 --> 02:25:04.677]  FreedomWatchUSA.org.
[02:25:04.717 --> 02:25:07.659]  They can see about our NSA case and everything else there, too.
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:11.543]  Yes, he wants to bring the United States down to its knees.
[02:25:12.243 --> 02:25:13.264]  He admired his father.
[02:25:13.284 --> 02:25:14.445]  His father was Muslim.
[02:25:14.845 --> 02:25:21.571]  His father was thrown out of this country because he overstayed his student visa, much like many Muslims are doing these days and others.
[02:25:22.392 --> 02:25:24.854]  And Obama, in his heart,
[02:25:25.899 --> 02:25:26.459]  I don't know.
[02:25:43.595 --> 02:25:48.359]  He would like to see the world run by Muslims, because that is what Islam teaches, okay?
[02:25:48.379 --> 02:25:50.220]  Now, not all Muslims are bad people.
[02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:51.220]  There are some good Muslims.
[02:25:51.260 --> 02:25:52.181]  They're no longer Muslims.
[02:25:52.241 --> 02:25:53.502]  They quit, okay?
[02:25:54.062 --> 02:25:55.183]  They saw what was wrong with it.
[02:25:55.383 --> 02:26:08.492]  But in my own view, is it anybody who practices the tenets of the Holy Qur'an, as Obama always called it, never the Qur'an, the Holy Qur'an, anybody who practices that is a danger.
[02:26:09.221 --> 02:26:12.784]  Because Islam teaches that you have to get rid of the infidels.
[02:26:12.824 --> 02:26:13.625]  And who are the infidels?
[02:26:14.445 --> 02:26:15.946]  Christians and Jews and others.
[02:26:16.046 --> 02:26:17.067]  Hindus, others.
[02:26:17.247 --> 02:26:19.269]  Look, the Indians don't get along with the Muslims either.
[02:26:20.090 --> 02:26:22.772]  Because the Muslims would like to eliminate the Hindus as well.
[02:26:23.212 --> 02:26:24.073]  That's their religion.
[02:26:24.853 --> 02:26:31.999]  So, the Holy Quran and the words of Obama, he's furthering what Allah teaches.
[02:26:32.379 --> 02:26:32.880]  That's my view.
[02:26:33.888 --> 02:26:35.608]  Well, the proof's in the pudding.
[02:26:35.649 --> 02:26:39.029]  It's happening regardless, and they're telling German women don't wear short skirts.
[02:26:39.410 --> 02:26:44.211]  It offends the migrants that are invading and running around screaming, and then Saudi Arabia won't take one of them.
[02:26:45.431 --> 02:26:48.912]  It's just absolutely insane to see this happening, and I wonder what's next.
[02:26:48.952 --> 02:26:53.494]  I mean, look at the White House and George Soros connected to kill the cop movement.
[02:26:53.754 --> 02:26:56.654]  They're actually trying to start a shooting revolution in this country, Larry.
[02:26:58.055 --> 02:27:00.556]  Well, absolutely, and you know who's behind that too?
[02:27:01.156 --> 02:27:01.936]  Louis Farrakhan.
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:29.166]  Who is Louis Farrakhan, a friend of Barack and Michelle Obama, from Chicago, head of the Nation of Islam, someone who has called Jews pigs, gutter religion, has advocated recently, just the last few years ago, killing cops, and killing white, and by extension killing Jews, because Farrakhan hates Jews, okay, and there's some Jewish cops, so you can get a twofer if you'd like.
[02:27:29.921 --> 02:27:32.383]  So, this is what we're dealing with.
[02:27:32.863 --> 02:27:34.844]  You know, you are who you associate with, Alex.
[02:27:35.705 --> 02:27:40.368]  And Obama has associated with these people and brought them in throughout his lifetime.
[02:27:41.068 --> 02:27:48.172]  But he was smart enough and smooth enough that he could pull the wool over the not-educated American electorate.
[02:27:48.192 --> 02:27:48.432]  Sure.
[02:27:48.913 --> 02:27:49.853]  Well, I mean, I'll say this.
[02:27:50.394 --> 02:27:52.115]  Let me finish this thought.
[02:27:52.135 --> 02:27:53.856]  I'm not quading him with Hitler, okay?
[02:27:53.876 --> 02:27:54.716]  Nobody's in that league.
[02:27:55.277 --> 02:27:57.738]  But that's what Hitler did in World War II.
[02:27:57.778 --> 02:27:58.879]  Germany was on its knees.
[02:27:59.565 --> 02:28:00.926]  It was dying economically.
[02:28:01.467 --> 02:28:04.309]  The Germans had a predilection for someone like Hitler in any event.
[02:28:05.190 --> 02:28:08.653]  But he convinced them that he could bring them out of their situation.
[02:28:09.314 --> 02:28:10.675]  And Obama did the same.
[02:28:11.396 --> 02:28:17.341]  And now, you know, six and a half years later, you know, we have someone like this who's destroying this country.
[02:28:17.741 --> 02:28:20.884]  And the Republicans sit there playing political games.
[02:28:21.445 --> 02:28:22.826]  And that's why Republicans,
[02:28:23.499 --> 02:28:27.943]  True Republicans are mad at their own people because the Boehners and McConnells of the world roll over to him.
[02:28:28.003 --> 02:28:29.684]  Obama's won every victory with them.
[02:28:30.104 --> 02:28:31.045]  They're totally defeated.
[02:28:31.085 --> 02:28:32.006]  They're a bunch of losers.
[02:28:32.806 --> 02:28:34.868]  And that's why Trump is surging.
[02:28:34.908 --> 02:28:39.472]  And he'll continue to surge despite his performance last night in the debate.
[02:28:40.012 --> 02:28:41.533]  Do you think Trump's for real?
[02:28:43.535 --> 02:28:44.836]  I don't know if he's for real or not.
[02:28:45.677 --> 02:28:49.740]  But people are willing to grasp at straws right now, like they're willing to grasp at Hitler.
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:52.462]  Because we have no choice.
[02:28:52.873 --> 02:28:56.056]  I don't think, I think Donald Trump is a good man.
[02:28:56.076 --> 02:28:58.618]  I think he's probably uncontrolled in his mouth.
[02:28:59.258 --> 02:29:01.360]  Okay, but he's not a traitor to this country.
[02:29:01.760 --> 02:29:03.561]  I think he wants to make this country great again.
[02:29:03.601 --> 02:29:04.222]  I believe that.
[02:29:05.067 --> 02:29:07.309]  And I think he's saying a lot of things that's resonating.
[02:29:07.729 --> 02:29:08.790]  No, I tend to agree with you.
[02:29:08.810 --> 02:29:09.671]  People are desperate.
[02:29:09.771 --> 02:29:12.293]  People are desperate for someone who will actually do something.
[02:29:12.313 --> 02:29:13.634]  Well, that's my final statement.
[02:29:14.014 --> 02:29:20.839]  I don't see how the establishment and Obama thinks they're going to start a civil war with gun owners and veterans and people and they're going to kick our butts.
[02:29:21.299 --> 02:29:24.242]  I mean, all the folks want to start some shooting war and kill all the cops and people.
[02:29:24.522 --> 02:29:25.883]  I got my problems with the police state.
[02:29:26.203 --> 02:29:27.464]  You're going to get your butt kicked.
[02:29:27.524 --> 02:29:32.188]  I mean, haven't they looked at the numbers, the demographics, that they're not going to win this civil war, Larry Klaman?
[02:29:34.136 --> 02:29:35.156]  Well, they have the NSA.
[02:29:36.116 --> 02:29:37.457]  So far, they have the military.
[02:29:37.597 --> 02:29:38.457]  So far, they have the police.
[02:29:38.477 --> 02:29:41.618]  The analogy I use, Alex, is that... I tell you what, do five more minutes with us.
[02:29:41.638 --> 02:29:43.158]  I know you gotta go, but we're gonna go to break.
[02:29:43.178 --> 02:29:45.198]  Come back, finish up your analogy.
[02:29:45.578 --> 02:29:46.498]  Yeah, complete that thought.
[02:29:46.518 --> 02:29:47.899]  Freedomwatchusa.org.
[02:29:48.379 --> 02:29:49.659]  And again, I respect Larry Klainman.
[02:29:49.679 --> 02:29:52.220]  I've said every time he's on, and he's been on for like 19 years.
[02:29:52.740 --> 02:29:55.160]  I disagree with him on this whole Muslim thing, and I'm sorry.
[02:29:55.660 --> 02:29:57.101]  It's just all coming true, folks.
[02:29:57.241 --> 02:29:58.861]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:30:00.014 --> 02:30:03.003]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.945 --> 02:30:06.633]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.805 --> 02:30:12.806]  Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[02:30:13.006 --> 02:30:19.131]  Do you ever wonder how the current migrant crisis is going to affect Europe and America a decade from now, if governments keep handing out welfare?
[02:30:19.451 --> 02:30:25.615]  Well, Sweden has been accepting a lot of immigrants for the past 15 years, and now 58% of the country's welfare payments go to migrants.
[02:30:26.035 --> 02:30:30.238]  The majority of violent crimes in Sweden are committed by first or second generation immigrants.
[02:30:30.638 --> 02:30:32.820]  Most of them refuse to assimilate into Sweden's culture.
[02:30:33.020 --> 02:30:35.903]  Even more shocking, nearly half the immigrants don't work.
[02:30:36.063 --> 02:30:39.966]  And now Sweden has the biggest employment gap in Europe between natives and non-natives.
[02:30:40.226 --> 02:30:47.773]  In other words, native Swedes are working their butts off to support an immigrant population who won't work and won't assimilate, but will steal, rape, and murder.
[02:30:47.933 --> 02:30:53.378]  Simply put, when a government offers free goodies and welfare to immigrants, the country is only going to attract the worst kinds of people.
[02:30:53.758 --> 02:30:56.762]  What's going on in Sweden is now going to happen in the United States.
[02:30:57.022 --> 02:30:59.806]  This is the new America brought to you by Obama and his puppet masters.
[02:31:00.006 --> 02:31:02.089]  More decadence, less prosperity and freedom.

[02:33:41.066 --> 02:33:42.828]  Finishing up your thought, recap.
[02:33:42.888 --> 02:33:44.969]  Go back to what you said for folks who just joined us.
[02:33:45.410 --> 02:33:47.411]  As you know with radio, people are tuning in every minute.
[02:33:48.011 --> 02:33:54.876]  At this epic point we reach, where the Ford Foundation, George Soros, Media Matters, they're all trying to start a race war.
[02:33:54.916 --> 02:33:58.799]  They're all trying to make every issue about the cops, using a few bad examples.
[02:33:59.720 --> 02:34:02.162]  It's just so classically communist.
[02:34:03.661 --> 02:34:09.064]  So classically gutter, so classically evil, and they're really trying it.
[02:34:09.184 --> 02:34:17.087]  I mean, but it seems like, because they have the media and everything ready, they might actually arrest people that are against killing cops soon.
[02:34:17.527 --> 02:34:19.528]  I mean, how crazy is this going to get, Larry Kleiman?
[02:34:20.309 --> 02:34:22.970]  Well, here's how bad it is, and this was the thought I wanted to finish up.
[02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:31.354]  And I hope that our friends at Right Wing Watch and People for the American Way and the Southern Poverty Law Center are listening, okay?
[02:34:32.452 --> 02:34:35.034]  You know, here it is guys, and you know, bend over, okay?
[02:34:35.594 --> 02:34:52.545]  The reality is this, is that with an NSA, and with a CIA, that can gather all of our information, if they had existed, and if King George III had had access to them in the days of the Revolution, our founding fathers would have never made it to Philadelphia.
[02:34:53.146 --> 02:34:59.550]  They would have been picked up, arrested, jailed, and executed before they got there to sign the Declaration of Independence.
[02:35:00.245 --> 02:35:04.328]  And these lefties who are now in control of our government know that.
[02:35:05.128 --> 02:35:06.889]  And they know that and they've intimidated us.
[02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:10.251]  And they're getting people scared so we won't rise up anymore.
[02:35:10.292 --> 02:35:11.512]  And I don't advocate violence.
[02:35:11.612 --> 02:35:12.933]  I advocate non-violence.
[02:35:13.514 --> 02:35:14.754]  A la Martin Luther King.
[02:35:15.575 --> 02:35:17.176]  A la Mahatma Gandhi.
[02:35:17.996 --> 02:35:19.417]  But we've got to start doing something.
[02:35:19.437 --> 02:35:24.761]  I had to try to do a rally a few years ago and we only had 300 people show up because people are scared.
[02:35:25.982 --> 02:35:29.644]  But we've got to rise up because the country is going down the drain.
[02:35:30.542 --> 02:35:34.803]  No one in Washington is able or willing to take on Obama.
[02:35:34.823 --> 02:35:35.763]  He's won every battle.
[02:35:36.303 --> 02:35:38.524]  And yes, George Soros is behind Obama.
[02:35:38.604 --> 02:35:39.424]  He is a communist.
[02:35:39.584 --> 02:35:40.544]  I mean, Soros is a guy.
[02:35:40.564 --> 02:35:41.645]  He's Jewish.
[02:35:41.685 --> 02:35:45.686]  He turned in his own people at death camps.
[02:35:47.026 --> 02:35:48.586]  He and his father, and profited by it.
[02:35:49.486 --> 02:35:56.228]  And you've got the Farrakhans in the world, and the Reverend Wright, and the other anti-Semitic
[02:35:56.954 --> 02:36:24.502]  Anti-white Christian people out there trying to destroy the world and no one's lifting a hand and the American people need to rise up and and that's what we're faced with right now and even the cops the cops say and this is pathetic because you know we need to protect everybody whether you're black white yellow or whatever the cops are saying hey I'm not going to intervene in these things in the ghettos anymore let them kill each other and we'll just clean up afterwards because we're going to get blamed and
[02:36:25.424 --> 02:36:25.724]  That's right.
[02:36:26.024 --> 02:36:34.168]  Crime in just one area of Maryland after that whole event, it tripled there in Baltimore over a few months because the police started slow rolling and it's just unbelievable.
[02:36:34.228 --> 02:36:36.409]  In closing, I'll say this is a ray of light and hope.
[02:36:55.100 --> 02:37:00.081]  Yes, folks know the NSA is there to track and trace and frame people and the rest of it.
[02:37:00.601 --> 02:37:03.402]  But we also have the internet to use it to organize folks.
[02:37:04.302 --> 02:37:13.064]  And I see people across the board really waking up right now, saying no to the tyranny, saying no to the intimidation, and really understanding what's happening.
[02:37:13.084 --> 02:37:23.146]  And I think they've jumped the shark at the Obama administration, saying the veterans are the number one enemy and they're going to restrict guns of social security owners.
[02:37:24.366 --> 02:37:26.949]  Our social security retirees who are gun owners.
[02:37:27.990 --> 02:37:32.274]  I think there's a point where people get out of fear and then get into fight mode.
[02:37:32.754 --> 02:37:42.303]  I just hope they fight the right way and direct their energy the right way because even though the establishment hates the system that made this country so great,
[02:37:43.104 --> 02:37:45.826]  It's very hard to turn off something this vibrant.
[02:37:46.266 --> 02:37:49.888]  And they've tried to do it, Larry Klayman of FreedomWatchUSA.org.
[02:37:50.688 --> 02:37:53.170]  But it's going to be a lot tougher than they think.
[02:37:53.190 --> 02:38:02.035]  You know, there's that oft-quoted passage, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.
[02:38:03.036 --> 02:38:03.656]  Or array.
[02:38:03.916 --> 02:38:05.077]  And I think that's what we see happening.
[02:38:05.097 --> 02:38:05.677]  You're right, Alex.
[02:38:05.757 --> 02:38:06.618]  I frequently say this.
[02:38:07.782 --> 02:38:13.428]  I'm a child of this generation, of Kris Kristofferson who wrote the song, of Janis Joplin who sung it.
[02:38:13.929 --> 02:38:16.993]  Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
[02:38:17.033 --> 02:38:19.015]  At this point, we have nothing left to lose.
[02:38:21.115 --> 02:38:22.556]  And doesn't that make us stronger?
[02:38:22.576 --> 02:38:23.776]  They push us to this point?
[02:38:23.896 --> 02:38:24.236]  It does.
[02:38:24.276 --> 02:38:25.217]  They push us to this point.
[02:38:25.497 --> 02:38:25.857]  They have.
[02:38:26.277 --> 02:38:28.378]  But I want to see it done in a non-violent way.
[02:38:28.818 --> 02:38:30.178]  And we need to rise up in the streets.
[02:38:30.759 --> 02:38:34.080]  Gandhi brought India and South Africa to its knees.
[02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:40.282]  Martin Luther King, when you listen to his speeches, I mean, it's like listening to Reagan, even though, you know, he had communist leanings.
[02:38:40.462 --> 02:38:41.483]  He was not a racist.
[02:38:42.523 --> 02:38:44.384]  He respected all people.
[02:38:45.024 --> 02:38:48.185]  And right now, what we've got leading the so-called civil rights movement
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:50.101]  Are people who don't.
[02:38:50.322 --> 02:38:54.947]  And frankly, the most courageous people in this country are the African American black conservatives.
[02:38:55.547 --> 02:38:57.709]  People like Sheriff David Clark out there in Milwaukee.
[02:38:57.749 --> 02:38:59.071]  Yeah, he's a great guy.
[02:38:59.091 --> 02:39:00.432]  Imagine having him as president.
[02:39:00.953 --> 02:39:02.454]  Allen Keyes, Ben Carson.
[02:39:02.895 --> 02:39:04.176]  I mean, they're being blunt, okay?
[02:39:04.196 --> 02:39:05.217]  They're saying it straight up.
[02:39:05.698 --> 02:39:11.344]  It's the white people who are cowering in caves right now, and they need to come out, and we all need to work together.
[02:39:12.134 --> 02:39:27.169]  Because we have to have a country which where everybody's treated equally and fairly and we've got to have a country which is based on freedom and capitalism and the ability to move ahead without getting into a communist state, which is what Obama and Soros and the rest of them want.
[02:39:28.773 --> 02:39:30.336]  Larry Klaman, always a powerful interview.
[02:39:30.396 --> 02:39:33.200]  Great job with the NSA and the fact that your fight continues.
[02:39:33.220 --> 02:39:34.162]  You've had another victory.
[02:39:34.442 --> 02:39:37.948]  The media has spun it as a defeat, as they always do, to take our hope away.
[02:39:38.008 --> 02:39:39.751]  But we know that hope springs eternal.
[02:39:39.791 --> 02:39:40.332]  God bless you.
[02:39:40.732 --> 02:39:41.493]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:39:41.553 --> 02:39:41.894]  Thank you.
[02:39:42.355 --> 02:39:43.136]  There he goes, folks.
[02:39:44.598 --> 02:39:48.781]  We live in very epic times, and they want to play Muslims off against Christians and vice versa.
[02:39:48.881 --> 02:40:05.295]  I know that most Muslims do not want to have wars, do not want to kill people, but our government's run by criminals that make money out of crisis, and they are funding radical Muslims to take over and do horrible things across the Middle East, North Africa, and other areas, Central Asia, and I stand against that.
[02:40:06.735 --> 02:40:08.056]  And I just want people to live in peace.
[02:40:08.156 --> 02:40:18.605]  You know, I had read about this letter in a Time-Life article when I was a little kid, but this weekend I was online doing research on some World War II events, and I came across the handwritten letter in 1940.
[02:40:18.725 --> 02:40:27.131]  It was actually mailed in late 1939, to Adolf Hitler, seeking peace, or someone will quote, beat you with your own weapon.
[02:40:28.392 --> 02:40:32.156]  And it's an admitted letter from Mahatma Gandhi, who was not a big fan of England,
[02:40:34.296 --> 02:40:35.097]  And a lot of other things.
[02:40:35.117 --> 02:40:39.961]  You have to understand, Hitler was seen as a good guy even in like, you know, Time Magazine at the time.
[02:40:40.842 --> 02:40:55.096]  But Gandhi sent him the letter and I read it and he said, listen, you will basically end up losing this and the weapons you're going to use will end up being used against you.
[02:40:56.643 --> 02:40:59.745]  Uh, and he basically, in fact, scroll down, I'll read you the whole letter.
[02:41:00.025 --> 02:41:07.148]  Here's the full version of the letter, which is the longer of Gandhi's two letters to Hitler, and I've read two of them.
[02:41:07.168 --> 02:41:08.789]  Let me see which one this is they found.
[02:41:08.809 --> 02:41:09.709]  I told them to search for it.
[02:41:10.730 --> 02:41:12.891]  That I address you as a friend is no formality.
[02:41:15.832 --> 02:41:16.812]  I own no foes.
[02:41:16.992 --> 02:41:17.693]  My business
[02:41:18.948 --> 02:41:28.131]  In life has been for the past 33 years to enlist the friendship of the whole of humanity by befriending mankind irrespective of race, color, or creed.
[02:41:29.171 --> 02:41:39.254]  I hope you will have the time and the desire to know how good portion of humanity owes a viewing living under the influence of the doctrine of universal friendship
[02:41:41.072 --> 02:41:41.933]  View your action.
[02:41:42.513 --> 02:41:51.000]  We have no doubt about your bravery or devotion to your fatherland, nor do we believe that you are the monster described by your opponents.
[02:41:52.076 --> 02:42:07.703]  But your own writings and pronouncements and those of your friends and admirers leave no room for doubt that many of your acts are monstrous and unbecoming of humanity and dignity, especially estimation of men like me who believe in universal friendliness.
[02:42:08.363 --> 02:42:15.206]  Such are your humiliation of the Czechoslovakia, the rape of Poland, and the swallowing of Denmark.
[02:42:15.646 --> 02:42:16.907]  This is the second letter.
[02:42:17.467 --> 02:42:19.688]  The first one is probably even the more important one.
[02:42:20.288 --> 02:42:28.235]  I am aware that your view of life regards such spontanations as virtuous acts.
[02:42:28.875 --> 02:42:33.980]  But we have been taught by from childhood to regard them as acts degrading humanity.
[02:42:34.020 --> 02:42:38.944]  Hence, we cannot possibly wish success to your arms.
[02:42:39.965 --> 02:42:42.407]  And then it just goes on to warn him that he will be defeated.
[02:42:42.427 --> 02:42:46.210]  In fact, I should do a whole video on these and I'll do that.
[02:42:48.353 --> 02:42:52.416]  But the first letter is a lot friendlier before he starts World War II.
[02:42:54.338 --> 02:42:59.883]  And you look back and you see how Hitler got 20 plus million Germans killed.
[02:43:03.286 --> 02:43:08.070]  And I just want to say to the establishment today, you're not going to get away with what you're doing.
[02:43:09.211 --> 02:43:10.832]  I know you think the whole world's yours.
[02:43:10.852 --> 02:43:14.075]  You've got this possession, this drive for global domination.
[02:43:14.115 --> 02:43:14.916]  It's not going to happen.
[02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:18.041]  People are going to rally against you.
[02:43:18.381 --> 02:43:19.602]  People are going to fight you.
[02:43:19.982 --> 02:43:21.162]  People are going to say no.
[02:43:21.623 --> 02:43:22.803]  People are going to resist.
[02:43:24.604 --> 02:43:28.926]  And no matter how sophisticated or high-tech your systems are, you will fail.
[02:43:31.468 --> 02:43:34.369]  Now, you may succeed in turning the world very evil.
[02:43:34.669 --> 02:43:42.373]  You may bring in a great technocracy, but you yourselves, the facts have shown and my gut tells me, will be destroyed.
[02:43:42.793 --> 02:43:45.755]  You and your children that are creating this world government,
[02:43:47.227 --> 02:43:52.450]  We'll never share in the perceived benefits that you've been promoting to your own minions.
[02:43:54.412 --> 02:44:00.175]  And that's my only warning to you is that you need to turn back.
[02:44:00.195 --> 02:44:02.217]  You need to turn back down.
[02:44:03.629 --> 02:44:05.570]  We're not offensively attacking anybody.
[02:44:05.630 --> 02:44:30.682]  We are offensively, with information, trying to stop violence, stop war, stop oppression, stop the promotion of racism, stop the promotion of civil war, stop the promotion of police brutality, stop the promotion of the full spectrum that the globalists use like a palette of paint to create this monstrous masterpiece that they've almost completed.
[02:44:34.807 --> 02:44:37.388]  Yeah, they did find the earlier letter that'll go to your phone calls.
[02:44:37.468 --> 02:44:41.649]  It's just hard to read in that format, but... This is Mahatma Gandhi to Hitler.
[02:44:41.749 --> 02:44:45.111]  Friends have urged me to write to you for the sake of humanity.
[02:44:45.831 --> 02:44:52.693]  But I have resisted their request because of the feeling that any letter from me would be an impertinence.
[02:44:53.594 --> 02:44:59.816]  Something tells me that I must not calculate, that I must make my appeal for whatever it may be worth.
[02:45:01.383 --> 02:45:11.706]  It is quite clear that you are today the one person in the world, think of that, who could have stopped World War II, who can prevent a war which may reduce humanity to a savage state.
[02:45:14.626 --> 02:45:20.008]  Must you pay the price for an object however worthy it may appear to you to be?
[02:45:21.104 --> 02:45:30.026]  Will you listen to the appeal of one who has deliberately shunned the method of war, not without considerable success?
[02:45:30.806 --> 02:45:37.808]  Anyway, I anticipate your forgiveness if I have erred in writing to you.
[02:45:39.808 --> 02:45:50.491]  But to me the letter is so powerful because this is a guy that freed 500 million people by simply saying, we're not going to pay taxes, British taxes, on salt.
[02:45:51.820 --> 02:45:54.262]  We're gonna walk to the ocean and collect it ourselves.
[02:45:54.322 --> 02:45:54.922]  It's our country.
[02:45:57.404 --> 02:45:59.626]  And that's where Bundy Ranch and things like that come in.
[02:45:59.986 --> 02:46:07.891]  When we refuse to pay taxes because they're unjust, or our government's illegitimate, when we refuse to submit, that's the real act of war.
[02:46:08.766 --> 02:46:10.668]  When we speak out, that's the act of war.
[02:46:11.349 --> 02:46:13.271]  When we say no, that's the act of war.
[02:46:13.851 --> 02:46:21.679]  When a good person becomes a police officer and upholds their oath and defends good officers, exposes bad officers, that's real war.
[02:46:22.420 --> 02:46:26.625]  When you have children in a world this dangerous and raise them upright, that's a war.
[02:46:28.100 --> 02:46:30.881]  Then yes, Gandhi wrote a lot about violence.
[02:46:31.421 --> 02:46:33.041]  He was against offensive violence.
[02:46:33.081 --> 02:46:34.782]  He was not against defensive.
[02:46:35.282 --> 02:46:37.983]  If someone came to kill you, he was all for the Second Amendment.
[02:46:38.263 --> 02:46:41.744]  He defended the Second Amendment because the American left tried to get him to attack it.
[02:46:41.824 --> 02:46:44.044]  He wrote letters saying, no, it's a great thing.
[02:46:46.225 --> 02:46:49.046]  He was a very intelligent person, undoubtedly.
[02:46:50.946 --> 02:46:52.687]  But imagine if Hitler would have listened.
[02:46:54.807 --> 02:46:56.127]  How the world would have changed.
[02:46:56.807 --> 02:46:59.168]  Hitler who had a peace treaty with England secretly.
[02:46:59.528 --> 02:47:02.189]  Hitler who thought he was going to be allowed to take over all these areas.
[02:47:02.609 --> 02:47:05.829]  Hitler who was set up, believed he was invincible.
[02:47:06.149 --> 02:47:07.910]  Believed he had the deals done.
[02:47:08.210 --> 02:47:15.391]  Believed his agents and his operatives inside all these different organizations were unstoppable.
[02:47:15.951 --> 02:47:18.632]  That he'd infiltrated America and Russia and England.
[02:47:19.252 --> 02:47:22.513]  Well, Hitler, you found out that in the final equation
[02:47:23.453 --> 02:47:24.714]  You were given France.
[02:47:26.035 --> 02:47:27.256]  You were given Poland.
[02:47:27.816 --> 02:47:29.517]  You were given Czechoslovakia.
[02:47:30.017 --> 02:47:34.641]  You were given, what was left of the Hungarian Empire, Austria.
[02:47:42.426 --> 02:47:46.128]  And so, Hitler is now known for crippling Germany.
[02:47:47.909 --> 02:47:51.232]  Hitler is now known for bringing in
[02:47:52.813 --> 02:47:56.615]  The new version of planetary tyranny that adopted all of his stratagems.
[02:47:58.736 --> 02:48:04.158]  And I see weak people who admire Hitler because of his snappy Hugo Boss uniforms.
[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:08.320]  And I feel so sad for them.
[02:48:10.101 --> 02:48:20.326]  Because the people that admire Hitler weren't there when over a million Germans were drowned in the subways by Hitler as an act of punishment because they'd failed him.
[02:48:23.317 --> 02:48:25.359]  Adolf Hitler was an enemy of the German people.
[02:48:29.842 --> 02:48:31.564]  Let's go to Eileen in Montana.
[02:48:31.664 --> 02:48:33.045]  Eileen, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:48:33.065 --> 02:48:43.473]  Hey Alex, I hope with this expansion and new reach that you start distributing some real environmental info, information, and be the sustainable solutions that the world needs.
[02:48:44.154 --> 02:48:49.298]  Well, there's big problems, there's real environmental problems, and I totally agree with you, and they've got all these counterfeit ones they push all day.
[02:48:49.538 --> 02:48:51.600]  Give me an example of some of the real environmental crises.
[02:48:52.566 --> 02:48:55.408]  Well, um, not just the crises, but the solutions.
[02:48:55.488 --> 02:48:58.571]  You know, you're not about global warming, but you're about sustainable.
[02:48:58.951 --> 02:49:07.858]  And I have the sustainable agenda that the world needs, that everybody screaming for a solution has not allowed since 1994, including Gore.
[02:49:08.339 --> 02:49:21.850]  Even though... Well, I mean, they have a counterfeit sustainability that just means give the globalists control over all the resources and restrict everyone else, and then put carbon taxes on everything instead of restricting GMO, toxic waste dumping, uh, stuff like that.
[02:49:22.839 --> 02:49:26.601]  Instead of not producing carbon emissions, you know?
[02:49:26.921 --> 02:49:33.403]  Because, one, if you end global environmental illiteracy, 99. everybody is environmentally illiterate.
[02:49:33.423 --> 02:49:37.145]  They don't even know what the environment is, and they don't know how their actions affect it.
[02:49:37.585 --> 02:49:39.706]  I will end global environmental illiteracy.
[02:49:40.402 --> 02:49:42.143]  To our disposable society.
[02:49:42.583 --> 02:49:43.783]  That is the biggest abuse.
[02:49:43.923 --> 02:49:46.284]  That emits carbon emissions.
[02:49:46.304 --> 02:49:49.585]  No, no, I agree that we've gotten to, we are wasteful.
[02:49:50.145 --> 02:49:54.386]  The disposable society creates disposable humans, disposable animals.
[02:49:55.726 --> 02:49:56.487]  I don't like it either.
[02:49:56.887 --> 02:49:59.927]  But the modern movement has a lot of trappings that sound good.
[02:50:00.528 --> 02:50:05.229]  At the end of the day, it's meant to sell you on a larger purchase of world government.
[02:50:06.598 --> 02:50:07.239]  Well, that's not me.
[02:50:07.519 --> 02:50:10.262]  Okay, believe me, they don't let me play their game, okay?
[02:50:10.382 --> 02:50:16.108]  Well, what I think I ought to do, Eileen, what I think I ought to do, Eileen, is I'm sure you've got a lot of great ideas you should write me a letter.
[02:50:16.128 --> 02:50:18.571]  Do you have a website where I can find out more about your ideas?
[02:50:19.776 --> 02:50:22.778]  Well, my website is down right now due to another government attack.
[02:50:23.058 --> 02:50:23.338]  Okay?
[02:50:23.358 --> 02:50:24.659]  My YouTube channel is gone.
[02:50:24.719 --> 02:50:30.383]  It just, you know, and, and I'm just by myself and I was, I was having a good summer and I wasn't going to deal with it.
[02:50:30.863 --> 02:50:32.444]  And now it's time to deal with it.
[02:50:32.724 --> 02:50:35.146]  But you know, it's down to an attack.
[02:50:35.226 --> 02:50:43.892]  And I mean, I barely have a job in Big Sky, which doesn't have to hire Americans, especially if you think that they should, then they're going to let you know, you're not going to be employed.
[02:50:44.152 --> 02:50:45.693]  And we have four ski areas here.
[02:50:45.713 --> 02:50:47.514]  I'm like, Hey, how about- No, I understand.
[02:50:47.574 --> 02:50:51.816]  He used the Chief Immigrant Labor to leverage everybody else out and play wars with it, I understand.
[02:50:51.856 --> 02:50:52.536]  Eileen, I hear you.
[02:50:52.876 --> 02:50:54.217]  Well, put the websites back up.
[02:50:54.257 --> 02:50:54.777]  Don't give up.
[02:50:54.837 --> 02:50:55.837]  I've had that happen to me, too.
[02:50:56.678 --> 02:50:57.398]  It's worthwhile info.
[02:50:57.418 --> 02:50:58.298]  You need to fight for it.
[02:50:58.879 --> 02:51:00.799]  James in Colorado, you're straight up.
[02:51:01.320 --> 02:51:06.482]  Then, we will talk to Taimon and others and play some more of these clips.
[02:51:06.562 --> 02:51:09.403]  In the fourth hour, the final hour, is straight ahead.
[02:51:10.549 --> 02:51:16.874]  My name is Bill Bonner and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[02:51:17.275 --> 02:51:22.219]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[02:51:22.739 --> 02:51:26.743]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about.
[02:51:27.283 --> 02:51:31.147]  This change has deep implications for life in America.
[02:51:31.567 --> 02:51:35.831]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[02:51:36.411 --> 02:51:39.153]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[02:51:39.533 --> 02:51:41.755]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[02:51:42.495 --> 02:51:46.438]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[02:51:46.899 --> 02:51:47.399]  They did.
[02:51:47.999 --> 02:51:52.423]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[02:51:53.063 --> 02:51:53.523]  They did.
[02:51:53.543 --> 02:51:57.506]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[02:51:58.067 --> 02:52:00.068]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[02:52:00.428 --> 02:52:01.609]  This will affect us all.
[02:52:01.950 --> 02:52:03.951]  You can watch the video for free right now.
[02:52:03.951 --> 02:52:08.478]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:52:14.463 --> 02:52:14.984]  It's true.
[02:52:15.104 --> 02:52:19.067]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:52:19.248 --> 02:52:21.129]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:52:21.650 --> 02:52:26.134]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:52:26.434 --> 02:52:39.026]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[02:52:39.286 --> 02:52:42.848]  Big Berkey Water Filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[02:52:43.089 --> 02:52:45.390]  The gold standard in water purification.
[02:52:45.750 --> 02:52:49.753]  And our filters last for years at less than two cents per gallon.
[02:52:50.053 --> 02:52:50.674]  Big Berkey.
[02:52:50.874 --> 02:52:54.376]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[02:54:31.103 --> 02:54:32.703]  Just punch her up, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:34.464 --> 02:54:36.624]  There she is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:38.124 --> 02:54:39.765]  I'm just gonna stay here until they cut to her.
[02:54:41.325 --> 02:54:48.987]  Leanne McAdoo, with George Washington backing her up, is gonna be sitting in in the fourth hour, the final hour.
[02:54:50.234 --> 02:54:56.938]  of the worldwide 2015 InfoWars Warchest Operation Money Bomb, hosted by Leanne McAdoo.
[02:54:57.418 --> 02:54:59.399]  I'll be riding shotgun with her for at least part of it.
[02:54:59.860 --> 02:55:02.741]  Anthony Gucciardi, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, they're all going to be in.
[02:55:02.761 --> 02:55:07.504]  We're going to get to James, Timeon, Mark, Aaron, Doug, all of you here in just a moment.
[02:55:08.825 --> 02:55:09.325]  But first,
[02:55:12.199 --> 02:55:27.589]  We are almost, if you punch up InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com, or go to InfoWars.com, we are at $681,000 raised, and I'm told they update it every 10 minutes or so with the phone calls and the internet and the rest of it.
[02:55:27.609 --> 02:55:28.450]  It's already over $700,000.
[02:55:28.530 --> 02:55:38.597]  So I want to thank all of you that have given, all of you that have donated, all of you that have bought products, that the profits of that go towards this.
[02:55:39.277 --> 02:55:41.599]  This will certainly really help us
[02:55:43.342 --> 02:55:55.206]  Keep the satellite up, have the closed captioning, get a few more reporters, camera people, video editors, have the travel fund to send reporters to key events around the country and the world, which you see us do here every day.
[02:55:55.646 --> 02:56:01.728]  So you are investing in eyes and ears that are having a massive effect.
[02:56:01.768 --> 02:56:11.932]  And one of our biggest shortcomings is talking about how successful InfoWars.com, the radio show, the nightly news, all of it is.
[02:56:12.725 --> 02:56:17.409]  We reach billions of people worldwide with our reach every year.
[02:56:18.249 --> 02:56:19.971]  Just on social media, it's 1.4, 1.6.
[02:56:20.611 --> 02:56:23.493]  We showed those demographics from Google and Facebook yesterday.
[02:56:24.174 --> 02:56:28.337]  Billions of views on the internet video platforms.
[02:56:28.437 --> 02:56:30.238]  A half million a year on YouTube alone.
[02:56:30.819 --> 02:56:35.823]  Terrestrially, 4 million, well it's 3 million, listeners a day.
[02:56:37.230 --> 02:56:39.652]  Not everybody tunes in every day or even every week.
[02:56:39.812 --> 02:56:45.796]  Overall, about 10 million terrestrial AM and FM listeners across the country.
[02:56:46.217 --> 02:56:47.418]  And the list goes on and on.
[02:56:47.678 --> 02:56:50.620]  And those are people hearing about how deadly vaccines are.
[02:56:51.060 --> 02:56:53.942]  Hearing about how the IRS collects money for the private fellow reserve.
[02:56:55.604 --> 02:56:56.925]  Hearing about globalism.
[02:56:57.245 --> 02:56:58.746]  Hearing about the New World Order.
[02:56:59.166 --> 02:57:01.448]  Hearing about Agenda 21.
[02:57:01.628 --> 02:57:03.109]  Learning about countless issues.
[02:57:03.169 --> 02:57:04.050]  It's so exciting!
[02:57:04.890 --> 02:57:05.031]  Now,
[02:57:06.129 --> 02:57:11.032]  I'm going to extend the free shipping into the morning hours as part of this money bomb.
[02:57:11.292 --> 02:57:13.614]  FreeShipping and InfowarsStore.com.
[02:57:14.955 --> 02:57:24.501]  But ending with the 28-hour broadcast and an hour and three minutes is 15% off the incredible good halogen, nason iodine, survival shield x2.
[02:57:25.582 --> 02:57:27.864]  30% off super male vitality.
[02:57:27.964 --> 02:57:30.305]  We've never had free shipping with 30% off that.
[02:57:30.705 --> 02:57:32.527]  Amazing game-changing key herbs.
[02:57:33.447 --> 02:57:34.528]  20% off brain force.
[02:57:34.568 --> 02:57:35.629]  Great way to try this out.

[02:57:38.872 --> 02:57:40.073]  It's already discounted.

[02:57:48.121 --> 02:57:52.265]  And Anthony Gucciardi is going to come in later with some other specials that are running as well.
[02:57:54.124 --> 02:57:55.805]  The storable foods from MyPatriot.
[02:57:56.345 --> 02:57:57.706]  Lowest they've ever offered them.
[02:57:57.746 --> 02:57:59.327]  We had their CEO on last week.
[02:57:59.968 --> 02:58:01.789]  In their six-year history, lowest ever.
[02:58:02.209 --> 02:58:09.734]  That's being offered at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:58:11.175 --> 02:58:18.900]  But even more importantly than purchasing products or making a donation, you can also call 888-253-3139.
[02:58:19.420 --> 02:58:21.902]  Even more importantly than making a donation or even buying the products.
[02:58:23.132 --> 02:58:33.134]  Is spreading the word to friends and family, neighbors, folks at the grocery store, online, when you sign off on Facebook or Twitter or YouTube or Pinterest or whatever the case may be.
[02:58:34.634 --> 02:58:41.338]  That, hey, check out InfoWars.com, check out this video feed, check out the audio feed at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:41.759 --> 02:58:47.082]  You, the people, have the power to take action and change the world, as Mahatma Gandhi talked about.
[02:58:47.202 --> 02:58:53.346]  We'll be back, straight ahead, with the final hour of the InfoWars Warchest Operation Money Bomb.

[03:00:20.059 --> 03:00:23.041]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:41.167 --> 03:00:48.212]  And now, ladies and gentlemen, Leanne McAdoo is here to co-host the final hour of InfoWars Moneybomb 2015.
[03:00:48.632 --> 03:00:51.694]  Leanne, I want to go to James who's been holding for an hour.
[03:00:52.034 --> 03:00:52.674]  Time on.
[03:00:52.694 --> 03:00:53.955]  I want to go to Mark.
[03:00:54.015 --> 03:00:54.756]  I want to go to Doug.
[03:00:54.776 --> 03:00:55.796]  I want to go to Aaron and others.
[03:00:56.397 --> 03:00:58.938]  I will not be here the entire time, but you invited me to join you.
[03:00:59.699 --> 03:01:00.660]  You've been here three years.
[03:01:00.680 --> 03:01:01.180]  What is it like?
[03:01:01.560 --> 03:01:04.603]  Live and in your face all the time.
[03:01:04.623 --> 03:01:07.345]  And you're wearing a vintage Van Halen t-shirt.
[03:01:07.385 --> 03:01:11.909]  I got one of those in 1984 in Dallas, the first concert I went to.
[03:01:12.810 --> 03:01:13.130]  Really?
[03:01:13.150 --> 03:01:14.772]  Yeah, one of the first, yes.
[03:01:15.072 --> 03:01:20.797]  Well, apparently they're gonna be in town this week, so... My dad goes, you like Van Halen, so do I, let's go.
[03:01:22.539 --> 03:01:25.401]  Under Texas law, he was allowed to give me a sip of his beer as he did at the event.
[03:01:26.747 --> 03:01:28.467]  So that's the first story.
[03:01:28.687 --> 03:01:29.348]  I've got a cool dad.
[03:01:29.368 --> 03:01:30.968]  I want to take him to the Van Halen concert.
[03:01:31.008 --> 03:01:31.948]  Your dad is real cool.
[03:01:31.968 --> 03:01:33.208]  It's good stuff.
[03:01:33.528 --> 03:01:34.669]  He actually works here now.
[03:01:34.689 --> 03:01:38.129]  We've got to get him on here.
[03:01:38.229 --> 03:01:38.890]  What a character.
[03:01:39.630 --> 03:01:45.491]  Well my first concert I saw, it was Lollapalooza and the Jim Rose Circus Sideshow was there.
[03:01:45.771 --> 03:01:48.192]  So I got to see Eddie Vedder drink.
[03:01:51.164 --> 03:01:52.405]  Eat glass and drink bile.
[03:01:52.425 --> 03:01:53.125]  That's not good.
[03:01:53.345 --> 03:01:53.985]  We don't like that.
[03:01:54.146 --> 03:01:56.527]  No, he's a terrorist.
[03:01:56.567 --> 03:01:57.807]  That's not what he wants, our guns, too.
[03:01:58.067 --> 03:01:59.728]  Hey, what do you got coming up today?
[03:02:00.449 --> 03:02:03.730]  First off, though, we're going to go to break and then come back with calls so we don't cut you short.
[03:02:04.150 --> 03:02:06.271]  Five minutes we're going to you, James, and time on, so stay there.
[03:02:06.291 --> 03:02:06.772]  Appreciate you.
[03:02:07.632 --> 03:02:09.854]  Leigh-Anne, what do you make of the epic success?
[03:02:09.874 --> 03:02:13.998]  We're up to $700,000, I'm just told, plus for the money bomb.
[03:02:14.418 --> 03:02:23.086]  And so I guess, people like us that do this, we're going to go ahead and extend it in through tomorrow to try to get that million dollars, as we've done before, that'll go into this operation, Leigh-Anne.
[03:02:23.126 --> 03:02:28.110]  Yeah, I'm probably going to sit back there and take some more phone calls, people calling in, because it's fun!
[03:02:28.130 --> 03:02:30.872]  It was fun back there, and people are really excited about it.
[03:02:31.633 --> 03:02:38.583]  You know, some really great specials that we have going on right now, and it was just, it's incredible to me to see that number.
[03:02:38.643 --> 03:02:40.846]  Every time we refresh, it just is going up, up, up.
[03:02:40.886 --> 03:02:48.396]  I can't wait to see how the mainstream media tries to spin what a success Operation Money Bomb has been.
[03:02:49.582 --> 03:02:50.403]  Well, more and more.
[03:02:50.803 --> 03:02:53.385]  They still attack us all the time, but it's like made-up stuff.
[03:02:53.725 --> 03:02:56.547]  They never attack us on real stuff anymore, which shows me they know they're losing.
[03:02:56.747 --> 03:02:59.269]  Well, yeah, because they know it just boosts our audience.
[03:02:59.949 --> 03:03:03.012]  They send people to us and then it wakes them up and they're like, wow.
[03:03:04.568 --> 03:03:15.255]  I'm switching over, which is why I'm so pumped to think that we will be on television as excited as people get about Trump because he speaks, speaks his mind, doesn't hold back and everything like that.
[03:03:16.135 --> 03:03:16.516]  Imagine.
[03:03:16.536 --> 03:03:18.177]  Who's that supermodel on screen?
[03:03:18.577 --> 03:03:21.399]  That was Anthony Gucciardi interrupting me during.
[03:03:21.419 --> 03:03:23.080]  So that's that photos of Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:03:24.581 --> 03:03:27.283]  That was me saying, Anthony, I'm trying to make a sale.
[03:03:27.303 --> 03:03:31.185]  Great job, Leanne.
[03:03:31.205 --> 03:03:33.206]  The whole crew working so hard the last few days.
[03:03:33.226 --> 03:03:33.427]  Go ahead.
[03:03:33.467 --> 03:03:33.747]  I'm sorry.
[03:03:34.309 --> 03:03:42.270]  I don't know, I just think it's, I think it's really exciting to see, you know, I just can't imagine people flipping through the channel and then one of us are on the screen.
[03:03:42.290 --> 03:03:43.871]  Oh, Dr. Group!
[03:03:43.891 --> 03:03:46.231]  Dr. Green Beret!
[03:03:46.251 --> 03:03:49.452]  He goes, stop calling me Green Beret!
[03:03:49.472 --> 03:03:52.552]  Oh, so it was an Army Special Operation?
[03:03:52.892 --> 03:03:53.593]  He loves it.
[03:03:54.153 --> 03:03:56.553]  No, he doesn't like being called Green Beret because he wasn't one.
[03:03:57.233 --> 03:03:59.154]  He like, the last time I did it, he goes, stop it!
[03:03:59.894 --> 03:04:01.534]  He's always rolling the eyes, he goes, stop it!
[03:04:05.111 --> 03:04:06.272]  Tell me what's coming up, Leigh Ann.
[03:04:28.459 --> 03:04:32.183]  Well, I mean, I guess we're going to do a little wrap-up with the debate last night.
[03:04:32.863 --> 03:04:38.489]  Obviously, the people are kind of surprised at what has happened, and of course, just the puppet show.
[03:04:38.549 --> 03:04:40.030]  People loved our commentary.
[03:04:41.010 --> 03:04:47.355]  So, I think we're going to kind of recap the best of... I didn't even get to see Biggs last night.
[03:04:47.435 --> 03:04:48.076]  I passed out.
[03:04:48.476 --> 03:04:51.218]  So, apparently it was pretty sensational.
[03:04:51.398 --> 03:04:53.320]  But it wasn't because there were tubs of liquor.
[03:04:54.181 --> 03:04:54.421]  No.
[03:04:54.461 --> 03:04:57.663]  And midgets swinging from chandeliers or anything.
[03:04:58.384 --> 03:05:00.105]  Alright, we'll be back with... Just ping pong.
[03:05:00.626 --> 03:05:01.466]  There was some ping pong.
[03:05:01.787 --> 03:05:04.088]  The one, the only... No, we're not as cool as we wish we were.
[03:05:05.950 --> 03:05:08.512]  Leanne McAdoo is co-hosting your phone calls.
[03:05:10.779 --> 03:05:12.921]  Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[03:05:13.461 --> 03:05:17.924]  President Obama has ordered the federal government to start conducting behavior experiments on U.S.
[03:05:17.964 --> 03:05:18.425]  citizens.
[03:05:18.765 --> 03:05:19.586]  Garrett, that right?
[03:05:20.006 --> 03:05:28.813]  The new executive order commands federal agencies to condition people into doing whatever the government wants them to do, effectively turning we the people into lab rats running through a maze for a piece of cheese.
[03:05:29.353 --> 03:05:39.101]  The feds are going to start hiring so-called behavioral scientists to encourage, meaning brainwash, people into, say, signing up for Obamacare or even turning into their guns at a local gun buyback program.
[03:05:39.801 --> 03:05:44.625]  So basically, the Obama administration wants to take the freedom of choice away from the individual and give it to the government.
[03:05:45.105 --> 03:05:46.787]  That doesn't sound like freedom now, does it?
[03:05:47.267 --> 03:05:52.751]  Freedom is the right of the people to choose how to live their lives as long as their conduct doesn't infringe on the rights of others to do the same.
[03:05:53.212 --> 03:05:57.235]  The Obama administration, however, wants to brainwash you into surrendering that basic liberty.
[03:05:57.655 --> 03:06:00.518]  They want you to be a lemming who jumps off the cliff when they say jump.
[03:06:00.878 --> 03:06:03.040]  But you have the power to decide not to be a slave.
[03:06:03.340 --> 03:06:06.522]  For more reports, check out InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:06:10.586 --> 03:06:11.867]  It's now more clear than ever.
[03:06:12.047 --> 03:06:15.649]  The Globalists have launched a planetary destabilization plan.
[03:06:15.889 --> 03:06:19.491]  Here at the InfoWars operation, we hope and pray that this is not the case.
[03:06:19.771 --> 03:06:23.593]  But the signs of things deteriorating around the world are unmistakable.
[03:06:23.793 --> 03:06:30.416]  For many years, I've been working with my Patriot supply, and we have now developed a private label called InfoWars Select.
[03:06:30.556 --> 03:06:35.279]  Look, it's important to have firearms and water filtration during a collapse, but you've also got to have food.
[03:06:35.559 --> 03:06:39.601]  InfoWars Select is a wide variety of their highest quality packages,
[03:06:39.921 --> 03:06:43.322]  At the lowest price they have ever offered before.
[03:06:43.422 --> 03:06:45.703]  It's an introductory offer for only two weeks.

[03:07:08.432 --> 03:07:14.437]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[03:07:14.717 --> 03:07:25.025]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[03:07:25.185 --> 03:07:28.108]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[03:07:28.268 --> 03:07:37.250]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[03:07:37.390 --> 03:07:38.811]  This is the good halogen.
[03:07:38.891 --> 03:07:41.651]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[03:07:41.952 --> 03:07:53.755]  Now we at InfoWarsLife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure, 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.

[03:08:16.943 --> 03:08:17.583]  Big Brother.
[03:08:18.243 --> 03:08:19.263]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:20.004 --> 03:08:21.104]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:21.764 --> 03:08:22.564]  You want answers?
[03:08:23.344 --> 03:08:24.304]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:24.904 --> 03:08:28.545]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:29.085 --> 03:08:33.186]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:35.546 --> 03:08:37.167]  Well, the Fed bluff is out.
[03:08:37.347 --> 03:08:40.007]  They're saying no rate rise after all.
[03:08:40.027 --> 03:08:42.047]  That's what Peter Schiff predicted here.
[03:08:42.067 --> 03:08:44.808]  And on the left-hand side of DredgeReport.com,
[03:08:46.894 --> 03:08:50.015]  Black middle schooler rips Obama in epic rant.
[03:08:50.055 --> 03:08:56.656]  That's going to be played coming up at about 40 after or so when Anthony Ucciardi is in here in studio.
[03:08:56.696 --> 03:09:01.097]  But let's go back up to DrudgeReport.com and that top headline there.
[03:09:02.417 --> 03:09:04.378]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, the Fed bluff.
[03:09:04.518 --> 03:09:06.338]  No rate raise after all.
[03:09:06.398 --> 03:09:07.699]  Let's click on that red link.
[03:09:07.999 --> 03:09:08.839]  That's all rigged.
[03:09:09.579 --> 03:09:12.140]  Well, I mean, that's what all of our smart folks have been saying.
[03:09:12.160 --> 03:09:13.100]  Now go ahead and click on it for me.
[03:09:13.939 --> 03:09:14.739]  Or I guess I can do it.
[03:09:14.819 --> 03:09:15.600]  Just click on it.
[03:09:15.620 --> 03:09:16.100]  There you go.
[03:09:16.120 --> 03:09:16.380]  AP.
[03:09:16.940 --> 03:09:20.781]  Fed leaves key interest rate untouched, citing low inflation.
[03:09:20.821 --> 03:09:23.903]  The big announcement just got made.
[03:09:23.963 --> 03:09:28.144]  Let's get that article up on InfoWars.com and let's get Peter Schiff.
[03:09:28.724 --> 03:09:30.945]  Folks wanted to get Peter Schiff on like last week and I said no.
[03:09:31.385 --> 03:09:33.826]  Let's wait till the rate announcement's made to see if he's right.
[03:09:34.506 --> 03:09:36.767]  Peter Schiff, we need to be calling him right now.
[03:09:37.367 --> 03:09:38.868]  He needs to be on for 30 minutes.
[03:09:39.068 --> 03:09:39.808]  Tomorrow.
[03:09:40.168 --> 03:09:41.569]  Peter Schiff has been proven right.
[03:09:41.869 --> 03:09:47.011]  I'm actually in communication with Peter and he can't do the show tomorrow, unfortunately, but I'll get him as early as I can next week.
[03:09:47.071 --> 03:09:47.872]  Perfect, perfect.
[03:09:48.392 --> 03:09:52.934]  Um, didn't, um, Dent also said they wouldn't raise it, right?
[03:09:54.315 --> 03:09:54.635]  Correct.
[03:09:54.875 --> 03:09:56.175]  That's the article I handed you earlier.
[03:09:56.816 --> 03:09:58.957]  Yeah, so I know you handed it to me earlier, I didn't look at it.
[03:09:58.997 --> 03:10:00.237]  How long ago did they make this announcement?
[03:10:00.257 --> 03:10:03.099]  I'm sorry, my own world today, doing this Money Bomb coverage.
[03:10:03.179 --> 03:10:05.099]  It's been about two hours.
[03:10:05.440 --> 03:10:07.180]  Oh my gosh, well I'm usually on top of stuff.
[03:10:07.741 --> 03:10:10.362]  Next time you guys need to kick me in the butt when a big announcement gets made.
[03:10:11.257 --> 03:10:12.877]  We don't need to tase Biggs.
[03:10:12.957 --> 03:10:15.438]  There's going to be no donation to get Biggs tased.
[03:10:15.978 --> 03:10:16.158]  Uh-huh.
[03:10:16.198 --> 03:10:20.599]  The new thing will be they're going to add shockers to me when I don't announce big announcements.
[03:10:20.799 --> 03:10:21.319]  Yeah.
[03:10:21.799 --> 03:10:23.119]  Then Leigh-Anne will taser me.
[03:10:23.939 --> 03:10:26.480]  Hey, you heard it, 10 G's.
[03:10:27.120 --> 03:10:29.540]  We need the big money, big money.
[03:10:29.560 --> 03:10:31.660]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:10:31.780 --> 03:10:32.781]  Small shockers.
[03:10:33.021 --> 03:10:36.481]  Oh, just like... Low energy shocking, like... Like shockers.
[03:10:36.541 --> 03:10:39.362]  I will touch my tongue to a 9-volt battery for $10,000.
[03:10:42.671 --> 03:10:44.773]  So you have to come with a 9-volt battery instead of feeding me grapes?
[03:10:45.173 --> 03:10:47.055]  You feed me 9-volt batteries.
[03:10:47.155 --> 03:10:48.797]  That's actually kind of frightening as well.
[03:10:48.837 --> 03:10:51.359]  I actually have never been able to do that, the battery thing.
[03:10:52.480 --> 03:10:54.021]  But I'll tase Biggs if he's willing.
[03:10:55.243 --> 03:10:56.744]  No, you're not tasing Biggs!
[03:10:59.326 --> 03:11:02.549]  He... Biggs is really... You will not tase Biggs, Joe Jennings!
[03:11:04.232 --> 03:11:05.193]  It was his idea.
[03:11:05.213 --> 03:11:08.035]  I'm like freaking out over that headline when I went to check Drudge.
[03:11:08.375 --> 03:11:11.598]  See, usually I'm checking Drudge when I'm actually doing the show, kind of that much, like every five minutes.
[03:11:11.918 --> 03:11:16.942]  I check InfoWorld, WorldNetDaily, CNBC, the Financial Times of London, my emails.
[03:11:17.423 --> 03:11:19.664]  Usually it's like every five minutes and they're checking it too.
[03:11:19.985 --> 03:11:21.206]  This was in here two hours ago.
[03:11:22.347 --> 03:11:23.347]  Federal Reserve leaves U.S.
[03:11:23.408 --> 03:11:24.508]  interest rates unchanged.
[03:11:24.969 --> 03:11:25.669]  Breaking news!
[03:11:25.689 --> 03:11:27.211]  The Titanic sank today!
[03:11:27.731 --> 03:11:28.512]  No, no, it's not that bad.
[03:11:28.532 --> 03:11:29.773]  The economy is in crisis.
[03:11:30.299 --> 03:11:34.600]  Well, what matters is all of our guests said they would not raise interest rates.
[03:11:34.720 --> 03:11:38.561]  Right, that would... And the media said they were, the question was when.
[03:11:38.621 --> 03:11:40.142]  So we're proven right again.
[03:11:40.162 --> 03:11:43.203]  That would just be suicide.
[03:11:43.223 --> 03:11:46.984]  Did you see the chupacabra they found on the back of somebody's back porch in Arizona?
[03:11:47.004 --> 03:11:48.124]  Let's scroll down, you can see it.
[03:11:48.944 --> 03:11:50.465]  They finally found the chupacabra?
[03:11:50.585 --> 03:11:53.446]  Yep, they stuffed it and then now they put it at the Federal Reserve.
[03:11:54.571 --> 03:11:55.472]  And, uh, there it is.
[03:11:55.492 --> 03:12:01.435]  Get up to your radio list or you can see the free feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:12:01.456 --> 03:12:04.658]  Well, clearly, just like Trump, you're just talking about her personality.
[03:12:05.758 --> 03:12:10.101]  Well, like Trump I'm talking about, there's a lot of... I'm not against what deep sea fish look like.
[03:12:10.121 --> 03:12:14.064]  I think it's interesting that we found a new deep sea fish species.
[03:12:14.404 --> 03:12:15.805]  That can breathe and walk out of...
[03:12:17.048 --> 03:12:17.368]  No, no.
[03:12:17.408 --> 03:12:18.009]  Trump gets it.
[03:12:18.029 --> 03:12:19.491]  Everybody enjoys insulting people.
[03:12:20.071 --> 03:12:21.072]  Here's the deal, though.
[03:12:21.973 --> 03:12:24.296]  Janet Yellen, I hate her guts and I'm sick of her.
[03:12:24.596 --> 03:12:26.097]  And I'm sick of talking about the Federal Reserve.
[03:12:26.117 --> 03:12:27.839]  I can talk about how horrible she is all day.
[03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:29.781]  What a con woman she is all day.
[03:12:30.302 --> 03:12:33.785]  But it's fun to call her a chewbacca.
[03:12:34.833 --> 03:12:36.295]  Leanne, you do not look like a chupacabra.
[03:12:36.335 --> 03:12:37.256]  It's truth news.
[03:12:37.356 --> 03:12:43.302]  You look, you look like the, uh, in the last two Lord of the Rings, uh, Hobbit series, the, uh... Hobbit?
[03:12:43.462 --> 03:12:44.964]  The, uh, the elf woman.
[03:12:45.164 --> 03:12:46.245]  Oh, hold on, let me do my ear.
[03:12:46.285 --> 03:12:47.767]  But you look, but you look better than her.
[03:12:48.127 --> 03:12:48.508]  There we go.
[03:12:49.324 --> 03:12:50.225]  Okay, there you go.
[03:12:50.325 --> 03:12:52.007]  Leanne is actually a wood elf.
[03:12:52.047 --> 03:12:52.287]  See?
[03:12:53.429 --> 03:12:53.909]  There you go.
[03:12:53.929 --> 03:12:54.950]  You put a little point on there.
[03:12:55.271 --> 03:13:01.497]  Can we put up the beautiful wood elf from The Hobbit?
[03:13:01.938 --> 03:13:02.779]  And we will have Leanne.
[03:13:02.799 --> 03:13:03.800]  Can we find her online?
[03:13:03.820 --> 03:13:04.481]  She's got red hair.
[03:13:04.921 --> 03:13:09.766]  If you gave Leanne red hair and a little pointed ear apparatus, you would actually have it.
[03:13:10.452 --> 03:13:13.154]  Alright, I'm going to shut up and go to phone calls.
[03:13:13.234 --> 03:13:15.095]  Leanne McAdoo, starring in The Hobbit.
[03:13:15.836 --> 03:13:17.437]  Who knew, ladies and gentlemen?
[03:13:17.597 --> 03:13:20.379]  Well, get a green screen, you know?
[03:13:21.060 --> 03:13:23.141]  We've got to turn that studio into a green screen room.
[03:13:23.161 --> 03:13:25.022]  We need to make a reenactment.
[03:13:27.424 --> 03:13:31.107]  Travis Knight will be Donald Trump, because he's already got the hair.
[03:13:32.381 --> 03:13:33.042]  Absolutely.
[03:13:33.122 --> 03:13:33.482]  Listen!
[03:13:33.502 --> 03:13:34.923]  I didn't think of that.
[03:13:34.963 --> 03:13:36.884]  We have... Don't tell him the secret.
[03:13:37.605 --> 03:13:41.107]  He just blew the fact that Donald Trump tried to escape as a young man here.
[03:13:41.127 --> 03:13:42.728]  That's why he knows all this and he works for us.
[03:13:43.288 --> 03:13:46.911]  And he was actually a guy born in like 1897 in Thomas Edison's lab.
[03:13:46.931 --> 03:13:50.353]  And then he came here and it's been over four years we've been training him.
[03:13:50.653 --> 03:13:52.995]  We're about to send him back to the future.
[03:13:53.936 --> 03:13:57.018]  To 1942 to then grow up and be the Donald Trump today.
[03:13:58.544 --> 03:13:59.664]  It's the master plan.
[03:13:59.684 --> 03:14:01.345]  Can we bring the young Donald Trump in here right now?
[03:14:02.086 --> 03:14:03.386]  Bring in the young Donald Trump.
[03:14:03.466 --> 03:14:03.986]  Is Travis here?
[03:14:04.026 --> 03:14:07.868]  Can we get the young Travis Donald Trumpus Supremus?
[03:14:08.208 --> 03:14:09.089]  Alright, that's enough.
[03:14:09.569 --> 03:14:11.349]  See, I start screwing around with it on air too much.
[03:14:11.830 --> 03:14:16.432]  Hey, Biggs, let's not forget, Joe Biggs is going to be announcing the winner of the raffle.
[03:14:16.612 --> 03:14:20.193]  I believe he's got to go in and tally all the, get all the names.
[03:14:20.453 --> 03:14:23.975]  Of course, the big secret is actually the young Donald Trump had a son named Joe Biggs.
[03:14:26.460 --> 03:14:28.821]  Young Donald, she blew your cover, brother.
[03:14:28.861 --> 03:14:29.321]  Come on in here.
[03:14:30.641 --> 03:14:31.381]  Come on over.
[03:14:32.041 --> 03:14:32.902]  You're Donald Trump.
[03:14:33.722 --> 03:14:34.822]  He's got... There you go.
[03:14:34.862 --> 03:14:36.503]  This is David Dyke's son.
[03:14:36.523 --> 03:14:38.363]  Does a great job video editing here.
[03:14:38.983 --> 03:14:39.823]  There you go.
[03:14:40.003 --> 03:14:44.025]  It's Donald Trump, folks.
[03:14:44.365 --> 03:14:47.425]  The young Donald Trump on the show of your radio listener.
[03:14:47.745 --> 03:14:49.146]  You gotta do it the same style as Donald.
[03:14:49.166 --> 03:14:49.446]  There you go.
[03:14:50.771 --> 03:14:51.892]  And it's not a wig, is it?
[03:14:52.092 --> 03:14:52.512]  No, sir.
[03:14:53.233 --> 03:14:53.893]  It's not a toupee.
[03:14:54.113 --> 03:14:55.414]  There will be hell toupee.
[03:14:55.474 --> 03:14:57.556]  What do you want to say about Rand Paul?
[03:14:57.856 --> 03:14:59.297]  Well, he looks ugly and is an idiot.
[03:14:59.357 --> 03:15:00.057]  He's an idiot.
[03:15:00.077 --> 03:15:02.058]  No, you gotta go like this.
[03:15:04.280 --> 03:15:04.760]  No, it's not.
[03:15:05.140 --> 03:15:06.941]  The look is... And you have to say, huge.
[03:15:07.101 --> 03:15:07.722]  Huge.
[03:15:08.823 --> 03:15:09.763]  It's gonna be huge.
[03:15:09.783 --> 03:15:10.744]  It's gonna be huge.
[03:15:13.666 --> 03:15:16.047]  There you go.
[03:15:16.087 --> 03:15:17.288]  Make America great again.
[03:15:18.513 --> 03:15:19.474]  All right, we better get to the calls.
[03:15:19.514 --> 03:15:21.215]  I apologize to James and Tymon and others.
[03:15:21.615 --> 03:15:26.818]  Hey, Donald, listen, we're trying, we've got those scientists from UT over here at the nuclear reactor.
[03:15:27.538 --> 03:15:30.840]  I think it's time we go ahead and beam you on back to when you were teenagers and you can grow up.
[03:15:30.860 --> 03:15:33.121]  I'm putting you in the presidency.
[03:15:33.401 --> 03:15:34.922]  Remember, Bill Hicks is putting you in the presidency.
[03:15:35.362 --> 03:15:35.943]  Right, Mr. Hicks.
[03:15:36.003 --> 03:15:36.303]  Thank you.
[03:15:36.483 --> 03:15:36.863]  Thank you.
[03:15:36.923 --> 03:15:37.163]  Good.
[03:15:37.904 --> 03:15:38.364]  There you go.
[03:15:38.404 --> 03:15:39.164]  The truth is out.
[03:15:39.265 --> 03:15:42.967]  Bill Hicks actually, I actually invented the time machine.
[03:15:42.987 --> 03:15:46.509]  I'm actually Thomas Edison's brother, and Donald Trump is my son.
[03:15:48.072 --> 03:15:51.515]  And I wanted to have a comedian career, so I beamed back and became Bill Hicks in the 90s.
[03:15:52.476 --> 03:15:52.696]  Yeah.
[03:15:53.377 --> 03:15:54.237]  Let's get serious, folks.
[03:15:54.257 --> 03:15:55.198]  We're fighting the new world order.
[03:15:55.539 --> 03:15:58.161]  James in Colorado, you're a trooper, you're a patriot.
[03:15:58.181 --> 03:16:04.606]  That's why we're going to get your name and number and address and send you a free complimentary Hillary Clinton for prisons shirt.
[03:16:04.927 --> 03:16:07.209]  So come on down for holding an hour and a half.
[03:16:07.669 --> 03:16:08.390]  Thank you, James.
[03:16:08.410 --> 03:16:09.010]  You're on the air.
[03:16:09.030 --> 03:16:11.332]  Oh, thanks, comrades.
[03:16:11.352 --> 03:16:13.294]  I appreciate it.
[03:16:13.534 --> 03:16:15.055]  What'd you think about meeting Donald Trump?
[03:16:17.881 --> 03:16:18.701]  The Young Jeeves?
[03:16:32.386 --> 03:16:34.648]  I hope everyone spends a dollar at least.
[03:16:35.149 --> 03:16:36.450]  Well, brother, you don't need to do that.
[03:16:36.570 --> 03:16:40.894]  You called in and I always want to say if people are not of means, they should not be giving.
[03:16:40.934 --> 03:16:43.016]  But it seems like it's folks that aren't of means that are giving.
[03:16:43.336 --> 03:16:47.360]  The middle class being raped are the ones that should be giving to an organization like this.
[03:16:47.700 --> 03:16:50.443]  I didn't know that you were not making a lot of money, my brother.
[03:16:50.483 --> 03:16:53.265]  So we're going to let you get $200 of any merchandise you want.
[03:16:55.827 --> 03:16:57.588]  So give us your name and number, your address.
[03:16:58.008 --> 03:16:59.009]  We're going to put you on hold.
[03:16:59.069 --> 03:17:06.113]  I'm going to have one of our great operators here at InfoWars call you in the next 20 minutes to send you $200 of any product you want.
[03:17:06.153 --> 03:17:06.693]  How's that sound?
[03:17:08.054 --> 03:17:09.474]  That sounds insane.
[03:17:09.534 --> 03:17:09.915]  Thank you.
[03:17:10.295 --> 03:17:10.975]  Thank you, my friend.
[03:17:11.675 --> 03:17:12.676]  What else did you call in about?
[03:17:14.277 --> 03:17:18.559]  Well, first, people should just give away, I think, 10% of their income, no matter how much they make.
[03:17:18.759 --> 03:17:20.320]  Just, yeah, that's a scarcity mindset.
[03:17:20.380 --> 03:17:21.881]  But I was going to talk about
[03:17:22.901 --> 03:17:24.422]  Have you guys heard of Talisman Saber 15?
[03:17:24.582 --> 03:17:26.263]  It's like Jade Helm.
[03:17:26.463 --> 03:17:28.124]  It's been going on at the same time.
[03:17:28.604 --> 03:17:29.765]  Yeah, there's a whole bunch of drills.
[03:17:29.785 --> 03:17:30.725]  They're all just a condition.
[03:17:30.785 --> 03:17:34.927]  As none of us are saying it's eminent martial law, they say we say that's a discreditance.
[03:17:36.688 --> 03:17:45.553]  Yeah, but the weird thing that I read, um, there's a lot of different articles, like the Forest Navies and different things about the Kazov Battalion training at Fort Carson.
[03:17:45.573 --> 03:17:51.236]  You guys had, uh, in the past, 2013, you put out a video about Russian troops
[03:17:51.863 --> 03:17:55.084]  Training at Fort Carson, and then you have that sheriff in Spokane.
[03:17:55.744 --> 03:17:57.865]  He's a, you know, Ozzy Nezevich, that guy.
[03:17:58.445 --> 03:18:01.947]  He's a, like, totally with Soros.
[03:18:02.207 --> 03:18:08.749]  He's a former FBI president of, like, a group that federalizes police, like, a fusion center committee head.
[03:18:08.769 --> 03:18:20.133]  It's really creepy, all the foreign troops and just the idea of these, like, white nationalists carrying out false flags to blame Russia, to blame patriots.
[03:18:20.954 --> 03:18:21.555]  I don't think so.
[03:18:41.892 --> 03:18:44.715]  More going on in the FBI.
[03:18:45.036 --> 03:18:51.023]  Oh, I know, and they've got these weird sheriffs going, the Patriots are about to kill everybody, and we've got these tanks for them.
[03:18:51.063 --> 03:18:52.645]  We're like, wow, don't kill us.
[03:18:52.985 --> 03:18:55.488]  I never said that, you lion terrorists.
[03:18:55.969 --> 03:19:01.656]  Let me pose on the newspaper trampling the American flag, or trampling the Patriot flag.
[03:19:02.341 --> 03:19:06.785]  And isn't it funny to see how quickly the Black Lives Matter movement got turned into terrorists.
[03:19:07.146 --> 03:19:08.387]  Now they're terrorists as well.
[03:19:08.447 --> 03:19:13.111]  So it's just so funny to see how easily, on either side, you can just, oh well.
[03:19:13.412 --> 03:19:14.593]  Well it shows how they were controlled.
[03:19:14.613 --> 03:19:22.320]  They were set up to now bridge the anti-terrorism movement into the American people, and then it'll go from leftist to conservatives.
[03:19:23.041 --> 03:19:26.924]  Anyone who wants to stand up and fight the system, and that's why we keep saying, don't
[03:19:27.899 --> 03:19:32.241]  All into the trap of black versus white, left versus right.
[03:19:32.821 --> 03:19:34.802]  If we gotta fight this thing together, you know?
[03:19:34.982 --> 03:19:38.464]  But, of course, you're not gonna have that when you got the Soroses.
[03:19:38.764 --> 03:19:42.485]  The shadow hand, the loving George Soroses.
[03:19:42.826 --> 03:19:43.426]  Thank you, James.
[03:19:43.466 --> 03:19:43.986]  Great points.
[03:19:44.046 --> 03:19:44.586]  Time on.
[03:19:44.646 --> 03:19:49.529]  You will be with us live in four minutes on the other side of this quick break of transmission.
[03:19:49.929 --> 03:19:53.310]  You're listening to the final hour of 28-hour global transmission.
[03:19:53.330 --> 03:19:54.611]  It's the InfoWars Warchest.

[03:23:09.574 --> 03:23:13.818]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[03:23:13.998 --> 03:23:17.901]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[03:23:18.061 --> 03:23:25.247]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[03:23:25.427 --> 03:23:30.451]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?

[03:24:16.740 --> 03:24:20.822]  Reminds me of my mom, bro.
[03:24:20.982 --> 03:24:21.522]  Crank it up!
[03:24:40.203 --> 03:24:41.144]  Again and again!
[03:24:42.865 --> 03:24:46.307]  Again!
[03:24:47.267 --> 03:24:48.828]  We're coming straight on for The Globalist.
[03:24:49.749 --> 03:24:52.791]  Guarding us is the unknown soldier, Joe Biggs.
[03:24:54.251 --> 03:24:55.312]  In his red, white, and blue.
[03:24:55.392 --> 03:24:59.635]  And he's going to be rifling off that rifle coming up in the next segment.
[03:25:00.695 --> 03:25:01.996]  And then I'm going to leave.
[03:25:02.016 --> 03:25:05.018]  I'm going to put Anthony Guiciardi in the seat co-host with Leanne.
[03:25:07.062 --> 03:25:07.883]  He's trying to dodge it.
[03:25:07.923 --> 03:25:16.673]  He's back there in his office writing articles, but I'm... I want to be on air, but you can only have so much Alex Jones, because once I've been on air three, four hours, the goofiness begins.
[03:25:16.993 --> 03:25:18.295]  Well, people love the goofiness.
[03:25:18.355 --> 03:25:18.935]  No, they don't.
[03:25:18.955 --> 03:25:19.796]  They want seriousness.
[03:25:19.816 --> 03:25:22.259]  And speaking of that, Time On in Colorado.
[03:25:22.700 --> 03:25:24.141]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:25:24.161 --> 03:25:24.782]  Thank you for calling.
[03:25:25.523 --> 03:25:26.083]  Hi, Alex.
[03:25:27.283 --> 03:25:33.830]  Uh, listen, I want to tell you guys kudos for the great job with this, uh, power bomb that you're doing.
[03:25:33.890 --> 03:25:35.271]  It's, it's just fantastic.
[03:25:35.591 --> 03:25:36.813]  Very informative.
[03:25:37.413 --> 03:25:40.196]  A lot of information and a few laughs in between.
[03:25:40.236 --> 03:25:41.037]  So it's really been cool.
[03:25:41.613 --> 03:25:42.374]  Awesome, thanks for watching.
[03:25:42.394 --> 03:25:42.854]  Thank you.
[03:25:42.874 --> 03:25:45.396]  Powerbomb seems like something Megatron would come up with.
[03:25:45.416 --> 03:25:46.797]  Powerbomb.
[03:25:46.837 --> 03:25:47.798]  Oh, Megatron.
[03:25:47.838 --> 03:25:48.458]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:25:49.819 --> 03:25:56.604]  Also, I want to tell you, long-time viewer and a long-time supporter of InfoWars Life Products is great.
[03:25:56.884 --> 03:25:57.965]  Can't say enough about it.
[03:25:58.305 --> 03:25:59.446]  Everybody get in on that.
[03:25:59.566 --> 03:26:00.207]  It will help you.
[03:26:01.090 --> 03:26:11.335]  Okay, getting down to it, I want to tell you, Alex, you and I are simpatico on about 99% of just about everything that you talk about, so excuse me, viewers and listeners, for that.
[03:26:11.535 --> 03:26:14.376]  But what are we not in conjunctive orbit about?
[03:26:15.477 --> 03:26:20.920]  It's possible that I may be misconstruing your position on religion.
[03:26:21.260 --> 03:26:23.921]  I know you're a believer in God and, of course, Jesus.
[03:26:24.001 --> 03:26:25.742]  You make that perfectly clear, and that's cool.
[03:26:28.516 --> 03:26:55.565]  From what you were saying about an hour ago, actually it's a little more than that now, you were saying, my inference from what you were saying was that if somebody wasn't in tune with Jesus, that they couldn't possibly conceive of the evil of the globalists and all the horror that's going on in the world and possibly stand... No, what I was saying is that I think people wake up to the evil in the world, that's going to get them closer to God, that's what I was saying.
[03:26:56.866 --> 03:26:58.047]  Okay, that's cool too.
[03:26:58.247 --> 03:27:06.694]  However, I've been up to the evil in the world for over 20 years, and it hasn't really brought me closer to God.
[03:27:06.774 --> 03:27:25.489]  It has brought me maybe closer to a spirituality and a love for my fellow man and the animals we share the world with, but it hasn't brought me any closer to Jesus, and I fancy myself, like I said, 99% on the same page as you, and I wouldn't want us to alienate
[03:27:26.289 --> 03:27:32.891]  The 22% of the population that has either no religious affiliation or are active atheists.
[03:27:32.911 --> 03:27:38.132]  Well listen, I'm not judging anybody and I don't think somebody that doesn't believe in God because they don't see the proof is a bad person.
[03:27:38.732 --> 03:27:48.254]  The people running the show though are into the occult and they know what they're doing and I'm ranting and raving for three, four hours up here trying to cover this stuff, trying to be honest.
[03:27:48.815 --> 03:27:50.355]  So I don't try to hurt anybody's feelings.
[03:27:50.815 --> 03:27:54.016]  As long as somebody isn't hurting somebody else, I'm not, you know, out to get them.
[03:27:55.217 --> 03:28:06.049]  So that's what I was getting at, is that I don't push religion on people, but a lot of people end up waking up and seeing that there is spiritual forces out there just because of the issues we cover.
[03:28:06.069 --> 03:28:07.731]  I think that's what I was getting at, but God bless you.
[03:28:08.011 --> 03:28:08.432]  Time on.
[03:28:08.452 --> 03:28:09.053]  Good to hear from you.
[03:28:09.073 --> 03:28:09.613]  Thanks for holding.
[03:28:09.974 --> 03:28:11.615]  Leanne McAdoo, you got any comments on that?
[03:28:12.156 --> 03:28:14.737]  Well, I've heard a lot of people say that, and I do agree.
[03:28:14.797 --> 03:28:20.939]  I mean, I think we've got to have an open heart, and we do need to see our brothers and sisters out there.
[03:28:20.979 --> 03:28:24.620]  We're all in this battle together, and it is a spiritual battle if you believe it or not.
[03:28:25.980 --> 03:28:28.501]  And when you expand on it, I'm not criticizing all Muslims.
[03:28:28.541 --> 03:28:34.263]  A lot of them are nice people, but the more and more dominant element of Islam is, do what we say or we'll chop your head off.
[03:28:35.143 --> 03:28:39.805]  And I just don't think that's too liberal, so I wonder why the liberals all seem to think it's so cool.
[03:28:41.158 --> 03:28:52.821]  Yeah, well, I mean, you can kind of see the hypocrisy there when they didn't talk at all about the feminists that protested that one Islamic talk where... Oh, she shut up with a top off.
[03:28:53.101 --> 03:28:54.402]  Should we beat our wives?
[03:28:54.542 --> 03:28:59.723]  That was the crux of the talk there.
[03:28:59.743 --> 03:29:01.483]  I've got to go, honey, to a conference.
[03:29:02.444 --> 03:29:03.344]  Should we beat our wives?
[03:29:03.364 --> 03:29:04.624]  I need to see you once and for all.
[03:29:04.644 --> 03:29:05.865]  Well, I can just tell them, of course.
[03:29:05.925 --> 03:29:06.845]  No, I'm joking, I'm joking.
[03:29:08.550 --> 03:29:09.710]  No, you should put them in a meat grinder.
[03:29:09.750 --> 03:29:10.710]  No, no.
[03:29:10.770 --> 03:29:11.851]  It's extremely oppressive.
[03:29:12.451 --> 03:29:14.211]  It's like the sexual mutilation, all of it.
[03:29:14.231 --> 03:29:17.212]  And you can argue, well, that isn't what Islam states or whatever.
[03:29:17.272 --> 03:29:18.072]  Well, it's what's going on.
[03:29:18.452 --> 03:29:19.912]  Well, and it's like what ISIS says.
[03:29:19.932 --> 03:29:25.073]  A very extreme version of that religion is the true version of the religion.
[03:29:25.113 --> 03:29:29.554]  And so they have all these young people who are maybe trying to get closer to their God.
[03:29:29.734 --> 03:29:33.475]  And so they're thinking they need to, you know, go to the extreme.
[03:29:33.495 --> 03:29:36.856]  And she said, nobody makes me submit.
[03:29:38.027 --> 03:29:38.247]  Right.
[03:29:39.128 --> 03:29:40.890]  And then she got kicked by the guy.
[03:29:40.930 --> 03:29:43.893]  And they were like, yes, we can beat our wives and topless feminists.
[03:29:44.394 --> 03:29:45.054]  And they kicked her.
[03:29:45.134 --> 03:29:46.896]  And no, none of the feminists stood up for her.
[03:29:48.044 --> 03:29:48.384]  Well, no.
[03:29:48.444 --> 03:29:52.128]  They just want to make bigs take his pants off and wear a hula skirt.
[03:29:52.188 --> 03:29:54.009]  And march in high heels.
[03:29:54.630 --> 03:29:56.131]  Yeah, they make the military wear hot red high heels.
[03:29:56.191 --> 03:29:57.673]  It's about dominating men.
[03:29:57.693 --> 03:30:00.535]  So really, they're like closet radical Islamists.
[03:30:00.555 --> 03:30:02.577]  The feminists are basically just oppressors.
[03:30:02.597 --> 03:30:03.758]  A lot of them are into women.
[03:30:03.778 --> 03:30:05.199]  A lot of feminists want to dominate women.
[03:30:05.219 --> 03:30:09.363]  They want the men out of the way so they can smack them around a little bit.
[03:30:09.383 --> 03:30:10.764]  Kind of have a duck's ass haircut.
[03:30:10.804 --> 03:30:11.305]  Get Daniels.
[03:30:11.525 --> 03:30:12.805]  Infowars.com.
[03:30:13.005 --> 03:30:19.127]  Do you ever wonder how the current migrant crisis is going to affect Europe and America a decade from now if governments keep handing out welfare?
[03:30:19.428 --> 03:30:22.468]  Well, Sweden has been accepting a lot of immigrants for the past 15 years.
[03:30:22.849 --> 03:30:25.589]  And now 58% of the country's welfare payments go to migrants.
[03:30:26.010 --> 03:30:30.231]  The majority of violent crimes in Sweden are committed by first or second generation immigrants.
[03:30:30.631 --> 03:30:32.812]  Most of them refuse to assimilate into Sweden's culture.
[03:30:33.012 --> 03:30:35.893]  Even more shocking, nearly half the immigrants don't work.
[03:30:36.053 --> 03:30:39.914]  And now Sweden has the biggest employment gap in Europe between natives and non-natives.
[03:30:40.194 --> 03:30:47.717]  In other words, native Swedes are working their butts off to support an immigrant population who won't work and won't assimilate, but will steal, rape and murder.
[03:30:47.917 --> 03:30:53.379]  Simply put, when a government offers free goodies and welfare to immigrants, the country is only going to attract the worst kinds of people.
[03:30:53.599 --> 03:30:56.740]  But what's going on in Sweden is now going to happen in the United States.
[03:30:57.020 --> 03:30:59.801]  This is the new America brought to you by Obama and his puppet masters.
[03:31:00.001 --> 03:31:02.082]  More decadence, less prosperity and freedom.
[03:31:02.262 --> 03:31:06.163]  Keep checking back at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for more reports.
[03:31:06.383 --> 03:31:10.325]  And follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, and give us your take on this issue and more.

[03:31:19.749 --> 03:31:27.973]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:28.133 --> 03:31:32.795]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:33.015 --> 03:31:39.738]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:39.798 --> 03:31:46.882]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:46.962 --> 03:31:53.845]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:54.005 --> 03:31:58.347]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[03:33:13.473 --> 03:33:19.477]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:33:20.097 --> 03:33:23.099]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:23.460 --> 03:33:26.122]  All right, we're going to play here in a few minutes this clip of Donald Trump.
[03:33:26.642 --> 03:33:28.803]  We also got a clip of Bush admitting he smoked marijuana.
[03:33:28.843 --> 03:33:29.624]  I mean, who cares?
[03:33:29.664 --> 03:33:32.746]  His family's been caught involved in narcotics traffic with the CIA.
[03:33:32.846 --> 03:33:37.089]  And then when I leave, Anthony Gucciardi's going to come in here and finish up.
[03:33:37.729 --> 03:33:40.451]  But the big news is the Federal Reserve has announced it's leaving U.S.
[03:33:40.511 --> 03:33:43.053]  interest rates unchanged, as we predicted they would do.
[03:33:43.993 --> 03:33:44.834]  That's a big deal.
[03:33:45.494 --> 03:33:51.138]  And, of course, we knew that was really going to happen when China started letting its currency drop and everything else.
[03:33:51.178 --> 03:33:54.560]  So this shows inflation and a lot more coming.
[03:33:56.021 --> 03:33:58.683]  Of course, we've got free shipping running into tomorrow.
[03:33:59.464 --> 03:34:10.331]  But until this hour ends, we've got 15% off Survival Shield X2, 30% off Super Metal Vitality, 20% off Brain Force, 20% off Silver Bullet, 50% off Deep Cleanse, 50% off Secret 12, 50% off Oxy Powder.

[03:34:28.288 --> 03:34:34.094]  Well, if we don't, we're going to quit Sunday at 6 o'clock when the Sunday 4 to 6 program ends.
[03:34:34.434 --> 03:34:35.996]  We're not going to be hammering this tomorrow.
[03:34:36.016 --> 03:34:37.778]  We're not going to be hammering it over the weekend.
[03:34:37.798 --> 03:34:39.339]  We're not going to be hammering it on Sunday.
[03:34:39.419 --> 03:34:43.283]  But a lot of people have emailed us and called us and said, hey, I'm getting paid tomorrow.
[03:34:43.323 --> 03:34:43.683]  I'll give you $5, $10.
[03:34:44.544 --> 03:34:45.866]  I'll buy some products I already need.
[03:34:46.226 --> 03:34:46.907]  Love what you're doing.
[03:34:47.507 --> 03:34:47.968]  Extend it.
[03:34:48.388 --> 03:34:48.628]  Right.
[03:34:48.709 --> 03:34:50.231]  Because they want to be part of the money bomb.
[03:34:50.271 --> 03:34:59.182]  So, because we've gotten hundreds of calls saying that just in the last few hours, we're going to extend it now and it will end Sunday 6 o'clock at the end of that transmission.
[03:34:59.663 --> 03:35:00.944]  I want to go to these phone calls now.
[03:35:01.045 --> 03:35:02.907]  Mark and Doug and

[03:35:13.655 --> 03:35:14.756]  I'll hold the microphone up to you.

[03:35:48.514 --> 03:35:51.236]  Never once did you come by my house for a cup of coffee.
[03:35:51.316 --> 03:35:53.817]  You come over and you tell me... Hey, everybody thinks I do that skit.
[03:35:53.837 --> 03:35:55.438]  Are you doing that because Gucci Artie's coming in?
[03:35:55.458 --> 03:35:56.839]  I invited him to my wedding.
[03:35:57.039 --> 03:35:59.220]  Hey, you come to my wedding and you ask me to do a thing.
[03:35:59.240 --> 03:36:00.161]  Why do you like something like that?
[03:36:00.201 --> 03:36:02.702]  You ask me to do murder on the day of my daughter's wedding.
[03:36:02.722 --> 03:36:03.263]  No, no, beware.
[03:36:04.349 --> 03:36:12.456]  So anyways, we have this Triton 10 AR-15 and now how you had to enter was donate $1,000 or more.
[03:36:13.097 --> 03:36:20.343]  I have gone over to the area where the customer service is and went and talked to the people answering the phones.
[03:36:20.504 --> 03:36:21.965]  How many people are in your pocket? 20.
[03:36:24.087 --> 03:36:25.127]  Twenty people.
[03:36:25.347 --> 03:36:26.728]  Twenty different people.
[03:36:26.928 --> 03:36:27.928]  One of a kind.
[03:36:28.008 --> 03:36:30.029]  I've already mixed them all up.
[03:36:30.069 --> 03:36:30.810]  They're all in my pocket.
[03:36:30.830 --> 03:36:31.890]  I'm just going to reach in and grab them.
[03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:32.890]  Drum roll, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:36:32.930 --> 03:36:33.931]  Thank you all for your donations.
[03:36:34.251 --> 03:36:36.171]  Thank you for helping fund the tip of the Spirit of the InfoWallet.
[03:36:36.192 --> 03:36:39.553]  And also, you will be getting a site as well on top.
[03:36:40.413 --> 03:36:42.555]  The winner is Brian Schnell.
[03:36:42.575 --> 03:36:45.697]  Brian Schnell, come on down!
[03:36:45.717 --> 03:36:49.020]  Well, you won the gun.

[03:36:50.181 --> 03:36:51.983]  Brian Schnell.
[03:36:52.023 --> 03:36:53.264]  We'll be in contact with you.
[03:36:53.304 --> 03:36:54.164]  I'll get your email.
[03:36:54.244 --> 03:37:01.150]  I'll send it to Head Down Rifles and they will be in contact with you to work out the legal matters to get this sent to your local dealer.
[03:37:01.450 --> 03:37:03.532]  Thank you for supporting the Info War.
[03:37:03.852 --> 03:37:04.493]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[03:37:05.160 --> 03:37:06.120]  All right, Brian Schnell.
[03:37:06.160 --> 03:37:06.961]  Watch your step, Joe.
[03:37:06.981 --> 03:37:07.441]  Good job.
[03:37:07.461 --> 03:37:09.222]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:37:09.382 --> 03:37:10.282]  Well, that's exciting.
[03:37:10.302 --> 03:37:14.383]  Oh, let's get ready to rumble!
[03:37:14.803 --> 03:37:15.444]  I'm excited.
[03:37:15.524 --> 03:37:16.044]  I'm tired.
[03:37:16.104 --> 03:37:22.026]  It's amazing to see what we've done, what the viewers have done, what the listeners have done, what the affiliates have done, what the sponsors have done.
[03:37:22.446 --> 03:37:23.226]  Very exciting.
[03:37:23.246 --> 03:37:24.467]  And hey, the satellite's already up.
[03:37:24.807 --> 03:37:27.148]  Affiliates from Houston, you name it, are already turning it on.
[03:37:27.808 --> 03:37:31.173]  And thank God, everything we've done has been successful so far, Leigh-Anne.
[03:37:31.193 --> 03:37:35.899]  In closing, because we're about to play this clip, I'm going to leave and let you finish up the rest of the transmission and take these callers.
[03:37:36.300 --> 03:37:42.388]  As soon as you come back, we'll boom-boom, give each about a minute and a half, and then Gucci already can finish up and kind of take us out of here.
[03:37:44.483 --> 03:37:48.105]  Amazing, we're already 27 hours, 37 minutes into this.
[03:37:48.505 --> 03:37:49.206]  Unbelievable.
[03:37:49.386 --> 03:37:51.327]  What's it been like for you being part of this Money Bomb?
[03:37:51.347 --> 03:37:52.587]  Because this is your first one.
[03:37:52.647 --> 03:37:52.847]  Yeah.
[03:37:52.947 --> 03:37:54.448]  You've been here three years, we haven't done one in a while.
[03:37:54.608 --> 03:37:55.929]  No, it's been a lot of fun.
[03:37:56.089 --> 03:37:59.011]  It is like a sleepover with all your best friends.
[03:37:59.171 --> 03:37:59.931]  Oh my goodness.
[03:38:00.171 --> 03:38:00.992]  It's been fun!
[03:38:02.132 --> 03:38:04.055]  Way too much food and snacks in the back.
[03:38:04.095 --> 03:38:17.331]  I've been grazing all day, but it has been so much fun talking to the fans and you know hearing their personal stories that they've experienced with the InfoWars life products and taking calls and it's just fun kind of like a free-for-all.
[03:38:17.851 --> 03:38:21.155]  I think people got to see our personalities here, and they love that so.
[03:38:21.696 --> 03:38:22.597]  We should go out.
[03:38:23.198 --> 03:38:26.281]  I thought it was like a reality TV with all these camera feeds.
[03:38:26.301 --> 03:38:28.243]  People can hit different feeds and see what's going on.
[03:38:28.283 --> 03:38:28.583]  Yes.
[03:38:29.004 --> 03:38:30.385]  Choose your own adventure.
[03:38:30.585 --> 03:38:31.847]  They see me blow up sometimes.
[03:38:33.829 --> 03:38:35.090]  We'll just turn the camera on.
[03:38:35.951 --> 03:38:37.212]  Well, that was a little shock though.
[03:38:37.252 --> 03:38:39.434]  Like, oh, exactly.
[03:38:40.015 --> 03:38:42.538]  But, but continuing, is this what you thought when you got hired on three years ago?
[03:38:43.502 --> 03:38:44.663]  It's much more fun.
[03:38:45.244 --> 03:38:46.304]  Much more fun.
[03:38:46.485 --> 03:38:50.728]  Like, I understand all the haters and the trolls, because I would hate me too, you know?
[03:38:51.169 --> 03:38:52.129]  Life's pretty awesome.
[03:38:52.510 --> 03:38:53.170]  I can't lie.
[03:38:53.551 --> 03:38:53.991]  Got a good job.
[03:38:54.011 --> 03:38:56.633]  Leigh-Anne, you are awesome.
[03:38:56.653 --> 03:38:57.934]  You are even more awesomer.
[03:38:57.954 --> 03:39:02.458]  No, seriously, you know, Hillary can laugh all day, but we're on her tail.
[03:39:09.340 --> 03:39:10.421]  That's the stuff of nightmares.
[03:39:10.881 --> 03:39:12.261]  Gosh, that's so awful.
[03:39:12.281 --> 03:39:13.802]  Should I give this to you like Excalibur?
[03:39:15.782 --> 03:39:17.583]  The Lady of the Lake presents it here, and I will take it.
[03:39:17.903 --> 03:39:18.983]  Out of the water comes your arm.
[03:39:20.224 --> 03:39:20.684]  Then I get it.
[03:39:20.944 --> 03:39:21.704]  Dun, dun, dun!
[03:39:22.085 --> 03:39:23.025]  Excalibur!
[03:39:23.065 --> 03:39:24.065]  Dun, dun, dun, dun!
[03:39:24.385 --> 03:39:26.746]  With this weapon, I, D, defeat the enemy!
[03:39:26.766 --> 03:39:28.867]  Alright.
[03:39:33.971 --> 03:39:35.332]  That is really an obnoxious toy.
[03:39:35.352 --> 03:39:36.233]  I hate her so much.
[03:39:36.593 --> 03:39:37.494]  You don't love her?
[03:39:37.514 --> 03:39:38.715]  I just can't.
[03:39:38.735 --> 03:39:39.816]  You know, I can't do it.
[03:39:40.016 --> 03:39:42.618]  In your gut, who do you think is going to win the 2016 election?
[03:39:45.321 --> 03:39:45.801]  I don't know.
[03:39:46.021 --> 03:39:47.983]  My gut, it's all tied up in knots over that.
[03:39:49.304 --> 03:39:50.305]  We were talking about it earlier.
[03:39:50.365 --> 03:39:53.428]  David Knight thinks Trump's going to get the... Trump and Biden.
[03:39:54.790 --> 03:39:55.530]  What do you think about that?
[03:39:55.591 --> 03:39:58.052]  I just hope Trump isn't suckering people along.
[03:39:58.092 --> 03:40:00.594]  But, you know, just talking about vaccines being dangerous is good.
[03:40:00.834 --> 03:40:01.594]  I appreciated that.
[03:40:01.834 --> 03:40:03.295]  I liked that he did not back down.
[03:40:03.355 --> 03:40:07.558]  And even though he knew it wasn't going to be popular with everyone out there, I appreciated that.
[03:40:07.578 --> 03:40:15.083]  I appreciated Fiorina calling out, you know, the Planned Parenthood supporters and saying, I dare you to watch these videos.
[03:40:15.143 --> 03:40:18.185]  And, you know, we'll see.
[03:40:19.506 --> 03:40:22.169]  Speaking of the debate, Leigh Ann, I just want to say great job.
[03:40:22.629 --> 03:40:26.072]  I'm going to go shoot some news for the Nightly News coming up tonight, get some stuff done.
[03:40:26.392 --> 03:40:29.515]  You're going to finish up here the next 20 minutes with Anthony Giussiardi, but first these callers.
[03:40:30.035 --> 03:40:33.519]  But right now, let's talk about the drug war while we switch seats with the Gooch.
[03:40:34.399 --> 03:40:35.841]  Let's go ahead and go to Bush.
[03:40:35.881 --> 03:40:38.043]  Forty years ago, I smoked marijuana.
[03:40:38.743 --> 03:40:39.424]  Here is that clip.
[03:40:40.134 --> 03:40:52.200]  Governor Christie recently said, quote, if you're getting high in Colorado today where marijuana has been legalized, enjoy it until January 2017 because I will enforce the federal laws against marijuana.
[03:40:52.500 --> 03:40:52.760]  Will you?
[03:40:53.891 --> 03:40:58.715]  I think one of the great problems and one of the American people don't like about politics is hypocrisy.
[03:40:59.196 --> 03:41:02.578]  People who have one standard for others and not for themselves.
[03:41:02.879 --> 03:41:07.663]  There's at least one prominent example on the stage of someone who says, they smoked pot in high school.
[03:41:08.123 --> 03:41:13.268]  And yet the people going to jail for this are poor people, often African Americans and often Hispanics.
[03:41:13.648 --> 03:41:15.850]  And yet the rich kids who use drugs aren't.
[03:41:16.330 --> 03:41:20.314]  I personally think that this is a crime for which the only victim is the individual.
[03:41:20.894 --> 03:41:23.497]  And I think that America has to take a different attitude.
[03:41:23.557 --> 03:41:27.040]  I'd like to see more rehabilitation and less incarceration.
[03:41:27.600 --> 03:41:32.545]  I'm a fan of the drug courts which try to direct you back towards work and less time in jail.
[03:41:32.985 --> 03:41:38.330]  But the bottom line is the states, we say we like the 10th Amendment until we start talking about this.
[03:41:38.390 --> 03:41:40.152]  And I think the federal government's gone too far.
[03:41:40.832 --> 03:41:47.155]  I think that the war on drugs has had a racial outcome and really has been something that's really damaged our inner cities.
[03:41:47.215 --> 03:41:53.859]  Not only do the drugs damage them, we damage them again by incarcerating them and then preventing them from getting employment over time.
[03:41:54.279 --> 03:41:57.100]  So I don't think that the federal government should override the states.
[03:41:57.461 --> 03:42:02.383]  I believe in the Tenth Amendment and I really will say that the states are left to themselves.
[03:42:02.543 --> 03:42:03.664]  I want to give that
[03:42:05.478 --> 03:42:08.742]  I want to give the person that you called a hypocrite an opportunity to respond.
[03:42:08.762 --> 03:42:10.123]  Do you want to identify that person?
[03:42:11.124 --> 03:42:14.308]  Well, I think if we left it open, we could see how many people smoked pot in high school.
[03:42:16.164 --> 03:42:17.765]  Is there somebody you were specifically thinking of?
[03:42:17.946 --> 03:42:19.887]  Well, you know, the thing is... He was talking about me.
[03:42:20.087 --> 03:42:23.230]  Yeah, I was talking about... That's what I thought, but I wanted him to say it.
[03:42:23.330 --> 03:42:26.073]  I wanted to make it easier for him, and I just did.
[03:42:26.113 --> 03:42:26.893]  Governor Bush, please.
[03:42:26.993 --> 03:42:30.096]  So, 40 years ago, I smoked marijuana, and I admit it.
[03:42:30.136 --> 03:42:33.959]  I'm sure that other people might have done it and may not want to say it in front of 25 million people.
[03:42:34.019 --> 03:42:35.521]  My mom's not happy that I just did.
[03:42:37.642 --> 03:42:38.143]  That's true.
[03:42:39.804 --> 03:42:40.525]  But here's the deal.
[03:42:42.498 --> 03:42:43.499]  Here's the deal.
[03:42:43.600 --> 03:42:46.944]  We have a serious epidemic of drugs that goes way beyond marijuana.
[03:42:47.204 --> 03:42:50.829]  What goes on in Colorado, as far as I'm concerned, that should be a state decision.
[03:42:51.310 --> 03:42:55.656]  But if you look at the problem of drugs in this society today, it's a serious problem.
[03:42:57.398 --> 03:43:02.883]  We're campaigning in New Hampshire, like all of us, and you see the epidemic of heroin, the overdoses of heroin that's taking place.
[03:43:03.124 --> 03:43:05.606]  People's families are being torn apart.
[03:43:05.986 --> 03:43:12.172]  It is appropriate for the government to play a consistent role to be able to provide more treatment, more prevention.
[03:43:12.873 --> 03:43:18.358]  We're the state that has the most drug courts across every circuit in Florida.
[03:43:18.378 --> 03:43:20.340]  There are drug courts to give people a second chance.
[03:43:20.581 --> 03:43:21.782]  That's the best way to do this.
[03:43:22.342 --> 03:43:23.463]  Let me respond.
[03:43:23.803 --> 03:43:28.046]  The thing is, is that in Florida, Governor Bush campaigned against medical marijuana.
[03:43:28.446 --> 03:43:43.715]  That means that a small child like Morgan Hintz that has 500 seizures a day is failing on nine traditional medications, is not allowed to use cannabis oil, and that if they attempt to do that in Florida, they will take the child away, they will put the parents in jail, and that's what that means.
[03:43:43.775 --> 03:43:47.638]  If you're against allowing people to use medical marijuana, you'll actually put them in jail.
[03:43:48.078 --> 03:43:55.644]  And actually, under the current circumstances, kids who had privilege, like you do, don't go to jail, but the poor kids in our inner cities go to jail.
[03:43:55.924 --> 03:44:02.229]  I don't think that's fair, and I think that we need to acknowledge it, and it is hypocritical to still want to put poor people in jail.
[03:44:02.289 --> 03:44:04.130]  I don't want to put poor people in jail, Rand.
[03:44:04.170 --> 03:44:05.351]  Here's the deal.
[03:44:05.411 --> 03:44:06.792]  You oppose medical marijuana?
[03:44:06.852 --> 03:44:10.695]  No, I did not oppose when the legislature passed the bill to deal with that very issue.
[03:44:10.835 --> 03:44:12.176]  That's the way to solve this problem.
[03:44:12.777 --> 03:44:15.139]  Medical marijuana on the ballot was opened up.
[03:44:15.159 --> 03:44:16.580]  There's a huge loophole.
[03:44:17.080 --> 03:44:19.502]  It was the first step towards getting to a Colorado place.
[03:44:19.582 --> 03:44:21.763]  And as a citizen of Florida, I voted no.
[03:44:22.143 --> 03:44:23.924]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:44:24.024 --> 03:44:28.047]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi sitting in here with Leanne McAdoo for Alex Jones.
[03:44:28.167 --> 03:44:33.911]  And I want to tell you that you now have less than 20 minutes to be part of history.
[03:44:34.371 --> 03:44:37.693]  Be part of history in the making with InfoWars Operation Moneybomb 2015.
[03:44:39.474 --> 03:44:49.479]  You have 20 minutes left to help us reach the goal of $1 million to reach 400 plus million people around the world with serious life-changing information.
[03:44:50.000 --> 03:44:54.722]  And the reason I'm such a proponent of this is I know that Alex doesn't take outside funding.
[03:44:54.782 --> 03:44:56.023]  He doesn't take loans.
[03:44:56.363 --> 03:44:59.264]  He doesn't get billions of dollars from government sources.
[03:44:59.345 --> 03:45:00.605]  He funds all this himself.
[03:45:01.085 --> 03:45:03.667]  And even with these products, he only takes a small percentage of profit.
[03:45:04.207 --> 03:45:06.709]  At the end of the day, this is really a game-changer.
[03:45:06.769 --> 03:45:16.639]  It's a game-changing event, and you have less than 20 minutes, about 15 minutes right now, at InfoWars.com forward slash Moneybomb and InfoWarsStore.com, where your purchase funds the Moneybomb.
[03:45:17.219 --> 03:45:18.701]  We've got free shipping!
[03:45:19.813 --> 03:45:24.196]  For the rest of the day, but also, these specials are about to end in about 15 minutes.
[03:45:24.616 --> 03:45:45.111]  We've got 15% off the flagship Survival Shield X2, 30% off Super Mal Vitality, which is the biggest deal ever because it also has free shipping, 20% off Brain Force, 20% off Silver Bullet, 15% off Deep Cleanse, Secret 12, Oxy Powder, all of the flagship products at InfoWars Life that are super high quality nutraceuticals made by the top manufacturers.
[03:45:45.731 --> 03:45:48.973]  Formulated by doctors and other chemists that really know what they're doing.
[03:45:49.333 --> 03:45:50.353]  You get super good products.
[03:45:50.373 --> 03:45:51.514]  You support the InfoWar.
[03:45:51.614 --> 03:45:52.854]  It's a win-win situation.
[03:45:52.894 --> 03:45:54.555]  It's a 360 win, as Alex says.
[03:45:54.775 --> 03:45:55.916]  You have less than 15 minutes.
[03:45:55.956 --> 03:45:56.216]  Call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:45:56.236 --> 03:45:56.596]  888-253-3139.
[03:45:56.636 --> 03:45:59.017]  I'm gonna go help Leanne after this with the phones as well.
[03:45:59.037 --> 03:45:59.478]  And, you know,
[03:46:07.273 --> 03:46:19.679]  It really is a powerful thing to be able to sit here on this broadcast today and talk about this because I've seen Alex go from saying, hey, let's launch a television station to actually having the satellite up in the air right now.
[03:46:19.799 --> 03:46:23.981]  And you can go on InfoWars.com forward slash money bomb and look at the stations.
[03:46:24.381 --> 03:46:32.826]  Look at the satellite information where he's already reaching across the United States and obviously has plans for six different stages to reach the entire globe.
[03:46:33.746 --> 03:46:40.308]  Now we also want to talk about some news and some other information for the remainder of this broadcast, which again, 15 minutes left for the InfoWars Money Bomb 2015.
[03:46:41.028 --> 03:46:49.591]  The clip we just played is pretty telling of how fake people are, and how fake all these politicians in general are, like stick figures up there.
[03:46:49.671 --> 03:46:54.552]  And I think Trump correctly calls them clowns, because that's how I would describe them as well.
[03:46:54.572 --> 03:47:02.515]  They're entertainers to the audience of the United States of America, who unfortunately is being drafted into their ideology of complete jokery.
[03:47:03.135 --> 03:47:09.657]  And it reminds me also how in September, this month coming up in late September, the TPP is coming back.
[03:47:10.337 --> 03:47:17.480]  And Obama and other ministers are already pushing it and saying this time it's for real, we're going to push every possible thing we can through.
[03:47:17.840 --> 03:47:21.641]  And Leanne, I mean, it just reminds us once again, they're up there talking about marijuana.
[03:47:22.101 --> 03:47:24.742]  Oh my God, Jeb Bush smoked marijuana one time.
[03:47:24.762 --> 03:47:26.763]  Yeah, right, like that's the worst thing he's ever done.
[03:47:27.003 --> 03:47:27.243]  Right.
[03:47:27.424 --> 03:47:30.947]  As they push things like this in the real centerfold right past us.
[03:47:30.967 --> 03:47:32.209]  And they don't mention that in the debates.
[03:47:32.249 --> 03:47:32.429]  Nope.
[03:47:32.729 --> 03:47:39.136]  They want to know what people's secret service code name is going to be and who would they put on the $10 bill and things like that.
[03:47:39.176 --> 03:47:40.598]  And that's, you're exactly right.
[03:47:40.618 --> 03:47:47.625]  They want to ram this through before the next guy comes in and keep us all distracted in the meantime with our entertainers.
[03:47:48.507 --> 03:47:49.567]  Well, that's the name of the game.
[03:47:50.087 --> 03:47:54.889]  It also reminds me of this new study here from the Washington Post that's being written about in the Washington Post.
[03:47:55.549 --> 03:47:59.030]  New analysis shows suicide links for teens on Paxil.
[03:47:59.190 --> 03:48:01.211]  Mischief in old study claiming drug is safe.
[03:48:01.231 --> 03:48:12.814]  So what happened was, about, what was it, 14, 15 years ago, they had a study that said Paxil, which is an antidepressant, anti-anxiety type drug, anti-psychotic,
[03:48:13.374 --> 03:48:14.275]  It's totally safe.
[03:48:14.335 --> 03:48:14.976]  Everything's fine.
[03:48:15.016 --> 03:48:15.956]  Give it to your teenagers.
[03:48:16.036 --> 03:48:16.917]  Give it to your kids.
[03:48:16.937 --> 03:48:17.338]  It'll help them.
[03:48:17.378 --> 03:48:18.318]  The doctors trust us.
[03:48:18.439 --> 03:48:26.546]  You know, it doesn't do anything wrong, even though I personally know people that have something called vitiligo, which is the Michael Jackson syndrome, where your skin turns completely white like a vampire from taking it.
[03:48:26.886 --> 03:48:27.807]  But it's totally safe.
[03:48:27.907 --> 03:48:29.168]  Yeah, it's totally safe, guys.
[03:48:29.508 --> 03:48:36.875]  And then now they looked at it again 15, 16 years later, and they found that that study, the data that that study had, was completely manipulated.
[03:48:37.645 --> 03:48:52.137]  And the original data actually showed all the side effects that it had, just like Eli Lilly in 1988 or something like that said that Prozac was safe, but they admitted later on that the same data that they said it was safe actually proved that it was going to kill people and cause suicide.
[03:48:52.638 --> 03:48:54.519]  I bet that's the only time anything like that's ever happened.
[03:48:54.539 --> 03:49:01.985]  Oh yeah, and then the Harvard doctor, researcher, came out and said that it was like the human population being treated like guinea pigs by Eli Lilly.
[03:49:02.406 --> 03:49:03.607]  So same thing over and over again.
[03:49:03.807 --> 03:49:04.427]  So then why?
[03:49:05.228 --> 03:49:11.572]  Is it such a big deal for Trump to say, hey, and keep in mind, Trump didn't even say vaccines are bad, right?
[03:49:11.612 --> 03:49:12.272]  That's the funny thing.
[03:49:12.453 --> 03:49:13.113]  He didn't even say that.
[03:49:13.133 --> 03:49:15.855]  He said, maybe they should be spaced out a little bit better.
[03:49:15.875 --> 03:49:16.335]  Right.
[03:49:16.695 --> 03:49:18.016]  Oh, my word.
[03:49:18.877 --> 03:49:19.997]  How could he say that?
[03:49:20.157 --> 03:49:21.478]  So, hey, we're going to take some calls.
[03:49:21.558 --> 03:49:22.939]  We're actually going to jump right into it.
[03:49:22.959 --> 03:49:25.160]  We're going to go to Mark in Florida.
[03:49:25.201 --> 03:49:26.822]  He says he wants to talk about the info war.
[03:49:26.862 --> 03:49:27.362]  What's up, Mark?
[03:49:28.519 --> 03:49:31.101]  Mr. Gujardi, you're actually part of the story I'm going to tell.
[03:49:31.581 --> 03:49:32.942]  I am interested to hear it then.
[03:49:33.943 --> 03:49:34.283]  All right.
[03:49:34.683 --> 03:49:38.686]  Three years ago, I kind of discovered Alex and kind of woke me up.
[03:49:39.206 --> 03:49:44.170]  I was just bartending, managing a bar that my family owned, like 29 years old.
[03:49:44.510 --> 03:49:45.951]  What am I going to do with my life?
[03:49:46.491 --> 03:49:48.533]  And I discovered Alex.
[03:49:48.653 --> 03:49:49.874]  I started a Facebook page.
[03:49:50.514 --> 03:49:52.456]  I grew it to about 35,000 people.
[03:49:52.516 --> 03:49:55.538]  I saw we were moving about four million people a month around Facebook.
[03:49:55.578 --> 03:49:55.858]  I said,
[03:49:56.658 --> 03:49:59.519]  Well, why not send them to my website?
[03:49:59.539 --> 03:50:00.999]  I didn't know anything about websites.
[03:50:01.920 --> 03:50:05.441]  Shot in the dark, started a website, started sending people to the website.
[03:50:06.001 --> 03:50:08.902]  I saw Mikael Thelen was writing for an online paper.
[03:50:08.942 --> 03:50:09.722]  I approached him.
[03:50:10.402 --> 03:50:11.583]  He started writing for me.
[03:50:12.523 --> 03:50:14.223]  Time goes on, things keep growing.
[03:50:14.964 --> 03:50:17.304]  You approach Thelen, he starts writing for you.
[03:50:17.965 --> 03:50:19.425]  Now he's over there at InfoWars.
[03:50:20.563 --> 03:50:23.085]  I mean, the point is that everyone has the power to do this.
[03:50:23.465 --> 03:50:26.748]  Everyone in their home has the most powerful tool man's ever created.
[03:50:26.768 --> 03:50:31.091]  The internet and the power of Facebook is just amazing.
[03:50:31.171 --> 03:50:37.936]  What someone can do with no money, just start an account, start putting information out there, and the truth is popular.
[03:50:37.956 --> 03:50:38.696]  It just snowballs.
[03:50:38.716 --> 03:50:40.838]  We've got 500,000 people on our page now.
[03:50:40.858 --> 03:50:43.400]  We're reaching... What's the name of your site, quickly?
[03:50:44.725 --> 03:50:47.307]  SecretToTheFed.com and ToTheDeathMedia.com.
[03:50:47.547 --> 03:50:47.928]  Awesome, man.
[03:50:47.948 --> 03:50:49.149]  Well, your story is inspiring.
[03:50:49.169 --> 03:50:50.350]  I want to talk about it when we get back.
[03:50:50.390 --> 03:50:53.332]  He's talking about Mikhail Thelin, who now writes for Infowars.com.
[03:50:53.692 --> 03:50:55.053]  Everyone can be a part of action.
[03:50:55.113 --> 03:50:56.615]  Everyone can really change the world.
[03:50:56.695 --> 03:51:00.278]  Small acts multiplied by millions, but in a bigger way, too, really makes a difference.
[03:51:00.498 --> 03:51:02.840]  We'll be right back with more calls and more information and news.
[03:51:11.179 --> 03:51:18.548]  Hey neighbor, what are you doing digging?
[03:51:18.688 --> 03:51:20.370]  You had a heart attack last year.
[03:51:20.390 --> 03:51:21.632]  Oh, I know.
[03:51:21.872 --> 03:51:23.213]  I was told no more hard labor.
[03:51:23.794 --> 03:51:24.895]  Then why are you digging?
[03:51:25.376 --> 03:51:26.718]  Well, I've been taking ExtendoVite.
[03:51:27.238 --> 03:51:28.460]  It's been approved to help my heart.
[03:51:28.980 --> 03:51:29.861]  ExtendoVite?
[03:51:30.041 --> 03:51:30.923]  Is that a new drug?
[03:51:31.758 --> 03:51:32.518]  No, not a drug.
[03:51:33.119 --> 03:51:36.440]  It's more like an herbal combination made from garlic and cayenne.
[03:51:36.940 --> 03:51:37.420]  Herbal?
[03:51:37.581 --> 03:51:38.461]  How can that help?
[03:51:39.081 --> 03:51:43.183]  Well, actually, we've taken herbs for thousands of years, and Xtendivite is doing the job for me.
[03:51:43.663 --> 03:51:45.744]  Does your doctor know about Xtendivite?
[03:51:46.284 --> 03:51:49.866]  Yeah, my doctor knows, and he said it seems to be working for you, so don't stop taking it.
[03:51:50.166 --> 03:51:51.607]  I feel great taking Xtendivite.
[03:51:51.908 --> 03:51:52.688]  I don't want to stop.
[03:51:53.089 --> 03:51:54.310]  To order, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:54.330 --> 03:51:55.050]  That's 1-877-928-8822.

[03:52:10.731 --> 03:52:14.512]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[03:52:14.812 --> 03:52:28.176]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up supplies all over the world so prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[03:52:28.336 --> 03:52:37.344]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[03:52:37.484 --> 03:52:38.905]  This is the good halogen.
[03:52:38.985 --> 03:52:41.748]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[03:52:42.068 --> 03:52:53.839]  Now we at InfoWarsLife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure, 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.

[03:54:24.845 --> 03:54:26.567]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:26.647 --> 03:54:37.336]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi here with Leanne McAdoo sitting in for Alex Jones on this historic InfoWars Money Bomb 2015 broadcast in the final segment of the Money Bomb.
[03:54:37.916 --> 03:54:45.283]  Now is the time to go to InfoWars.com forward slash Money Bomb in the InfoWars store and help reach 400 million people
[03:54:45.723 --> 03:54:49.324]  With the massive syndicated satellite launch, it's already up in the air.
[03:54:49.644 --> 03:54:57.266]  Now it's time to beam the information down like a sledgehammer, an informational sledgehammer, into the televisions of the entire planet.
[03:54:57.806 --> 03:55:04.068]  And you can still donate at infowars.com forward slash money bomb and purchase the products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:55:04.508 --> 03:55:08.209]  Alex has announced that he is going to extend
[03:55:08.829 --> 03:55:11.230]  The donations throughout Sunday to help reach the goal.
[03:55:11.530 --> 03:55:15.852]  It is already, I believe, at 750,000 out of a million, so we're almost there.
[03:55:16.293 --> 03:55:17.093]  Now is the time.
[03:55:17.113 --> 03:55:24.376]  30% off Supermail Vitality, free shipping throughout the day, 20% off Brain Force, 20% off Silver Bullet, 15% off Deep Cleanse.
[03:55:24.416 --> 03:55:26.658]  We're almost sold out, about five of those products.
[03:55:27.078 --> 03:55:30.199]  So now is the time to visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:55:30.219 --> 03:55:32.280]  We just took an interesting call from Mark.
[03:55:32.320 --> 03:55:33.161]  Thanks for your call, Mark.
[03:55:33.741 --> 03:55:37.883]  And we talked about how we can all be inspired to make a difference, and he talked about
[03:55:38.484 --> 03:55:45.701]  How Mikhail Thelin, who now works at InfoWars, he started off as just an independent writer with a big idea and wanted to help people.
[03:55:46.621 --> 03:55:52.443]  And then I started working with him and I recommended him to Alex, and now he of course writes amazing stories for InfoWars.
[03:55:53.223 --> 03:55:55.024]  And at the end of the day, we all can make a difference.
[03:55:55.044 --> 03:56:01.046]  And if you can't donate money to this platform with the InfoWars Money Bomb, you can share and spread the word.
[03:56:01.086 --> 03:56:07.969]  And that is of course the biggest effort that we all can do at an informational individual level, society level, and planetary level.
[03:56:08.389 --> 03:56:10.450]  Let's hit one more caller if we have time for it.
[03:56:10.570 --> 03:56:11.490]  Tim in Illinois.
[03:56:11.710 --> 03:56:12.871]  He wants to talk about the Money Bomb.
[03:56:12.911 --> 03:56:13.551]  What's going on, Tim?
[03:56:15.421 --> 03:56:15.741]  Hello?
[03:56:16.181 --> 03:56:16.841]  Hey, hey, we're here.
[03:56:16.861 --> 03:56:17.241]  Hello?
[03:56:17.522 --> 03:56:17.982]  Go ahead.
[03:56:18.022 --> 03:56:18.302]  Oh, you are?
[03:56:18.322 --> 03:56:18.542]  Good.
[03:56:18.582 --> 03:56:19.962]  Nice to talk to you.
[03:56:19.982 --> 03:56:20.962]  How are you all doing?
[03:56:21.242 --> 03:56:22.043]  We're doing great, man.
[03:56:22.083 --> 03:56:22.723]  What's on your mind?
[03:56:22.743 --> 03:56:24.343]  That's awesome.
[03:56:24.383 --> 03:56:24.963]  That's awesome.
[03:56:24.983 --> 03:56:29.264]  You guys are hardworking, and I really appreciate it.
[03:56:29.344 --> 03:56:37.767]  The thing that I was wanting to say, you were just talking about if you can't donate money, you can spread the word.
[03:56:38.267 --> 03:56:41.707]  You can give copies of the movies out.
[03:56:41.727 --> 03:56:42.348]  You can do all that.
[03:56:42.368 --> 03:56:43.608]  Well, this is what I would like to do.
[03:56:45.104 --> 03:57:00.636]  I have been a lighting director, lighting designer, and audio consultant for over a dozen years with one of the top, top Christian networks in the world.
[03:57:01.757 --> 03:57:03.699]  I would like to offer my services.
[03:57:04.141 --> 03:57:04.821]  Well thanks, man.
[03:57:04.881 --> 03:57:05.241]  Definitely.
[03:57:05.281 --> 03:57:07.882]  Go to InfoWars.com and pick the contact form.
[03:57:07.922 --> 03:57:09.422]  There's some openings and stuff for jobs.
[03:57:09.862 --> 03:57:10.602]  Send everything in.
[03:57:10.622 --> 03:57:11.462]  Send the resume in.
[03:57:11.863 --> 03:57:13.703]  And it sounds like you've got some experience.
[03:57:13.723 --> 03:57:14.923]  Potentially a really great fit.
[03:57:14.983 --> 03:57:16.043]  Thank you so much for your call.
[03:57:16.484 --> 03:57:18.084]  Let's go to David in Texas.
[03:57:18.104 --> 03:57:19.684]  He wants to talk about the Info War.
[03:57:19.704 --> 03:57:20.484]  What's going on, David?
[03:57:21.605 --> 03:57:22.485]  How are y'all today?
[03:57:22.785 --> 03:57:23.605]  We are excellent.
[03:57:23.625 --> 03:57:25.285]  What's going on?
[03:57:25.325 --> 03:57:31.627]  Well, I just want to offer up a prayer to put on the armor of God for you guys, for first.
[03:57:32.927 --> 03:57:33.327]  And then,
[03:57:34.865 --> 03:57:42.948]  Uh, that whole thing last night, uh, they failed to mention, uh, let's say MENA, uh, Arkansas.
[03:57:43.289 --> 03:57:44.209]  I lived through that.
[03:57:45.890 --> 03:57:46.390]  And, uh...
[03:57:47.099 --> 03:57:47.799]  Sorry, I don't know.
[03:57:49.180 --> 03:57:51.462]  First and foremost, we appreciate your prayers, by the way.
[03:57:51.802 --> 03:57:52.542]  Everything counts.
[03:57:53.122 --> 03:58:00.907]  Whether it's just a good thought, or a positive vibe, or whatever you want to think, we appreciate everything that you send our way, because we can absolutely need it in these times.
[03:58:01.147 --> 03:58:01.827]  Absolutely.
[03:58:01.947 --> 03:58:05.029]  I'm not sure exactly what you're talking about, unfortunately, on that.
[03:58:05.149 --> 03:58:06.110]  Please send us a news tip.
[03:58:06.430 --> 03:58:07.551]  But we have very little time.
[03:58:08.511 --> 03:58:13.715]  In closing, this is the conclusion of the InfoWars 2015 Operation Money Bomb broadcast.
[03:58:13.775 --> 03:58:19.520]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi with Leanne McAdoo, encouraging you to go to InfoWars.com forward slash Money Bomb.
