[00:00:11.516 --> 00:00:12.918]  Good evening, my fellow Americans.
[00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:21.228]  Over the past several weeks, you have heard a number of reports on TV, radio, and in your newspapers on the situation in Southeast Asia.
[00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:29.862]  I think the time has come for me as President and as Commander-in-Chief of our Armed Forces to put these reports in perspective.
[00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:44.553]  Tactics used during the Vietnam War by the CIA and the military eerily echo the current establishment's build-up of Stasi-style homeland security and that their declaration that the greatest threat to national security is sovereign patriotic citizens.
[00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:50.415]  Not the thousands of criminals crossing our southern border, murdering and raping American citizens.
[00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:55.236]  Not the Islamic terrorist organizations that have been embedded in the United States for decades.
[00:00:55.496 --> 00:01:01.698]  Among those variety of reasons, radical Islam might have been one of the reasons that the individuals took the steps that they did.
[00:01:02.338 --> 00:01:03.419]  You see, you say radical Islam.
[00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:11.784]  I mean, I think those people who espouse a version of Islam that is not... Are you uncomfortable attributing any of their actions to radical Islam?
[00:01:11.844 --> 00:01:12.444]  It sounds like it.
[00:01:12.464 --> 00:01:17.307]  No, I don't want to say anything negative about a religion that is not... No, no, I'm not talking about a religion.
[00:01:17.387 --> 00:01:19.689]  I'm talking about radical Islam.
[00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:22.010]  I'm not talking about the general religion.
[00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:29.309]  No, real Constitution-loving, apple pie-eating Americans are the number one threat to their own country, and 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.971]  How and why is that declaration even rational?
[00:01:33.432 --> 00:01:36.573]  Vietnam, 1965 to 1972.
[00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:45.298]  The Phoenix Program, a CIA-designed and coordinated infiltration of the political infrastructure of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, a.k.a.
[00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:46.959]  the Viet Cong Communist Army.
[00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.581]  Force must often precede reason.
[00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:54.295]  And the waste of war, the works of peace.
[00:01:54.741 --> 00:02:00.542]  The CIA had been covertly infiltrating Viet Cong strongholds to seek out names on their kill list.
[00:02:00.822 --> 00:02:10.184]  One of the tactics included parading innocent Vietnamese citizens around their village with a bag over their head and a leash around their neck, terrorizing all of the residents.
[00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:16.805]  The Vietnamese citizen on the leash would then be instructed to indicate which house the Viet Cong informer might live.
[00:02:17.225 --> 00:02:23.426]  The next day, the CIA's provincial reconnaissance units would kick the door down and kill everyone inside.
[00:02:23.846 --> 00:02:25.006]  Women and children included.
[00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:35.989]  The CIA's PRU would haul the Viet Cong off to regional interrogation centers where they would be tortured to extract information for the commanding officers, and then the whole process would be repeated.
[00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:44.592]  The Phoenix Program neutralized 81,740 Viet Cong operatives, killing between 26,000 and 41,000 of them.
[00:02:44.772 --> 00:02:49.573]  Peter Da Silva, the CIA Station Chief, developed the strategy known as counter-terror.
[00:02:49.853 --> 00:02:52.514]  The use of terrorism as a legitimate tool to use
[00:02:52.534 --> 00:02:53.115]  We're good to go.
[00:03:09.114 --> 00:03:09.915]  We're good to go.
[00:03:24.645 --> 00:03:38.444]  The upcoming Jade Helm operation from July through September of 2015 states that troops will operate undetected amongst civilian populations to see if they can infiltrate without being noticed.
[00:03:38.845 --> 00:03:41.669]  With martial law plans that have been in place for decades,
[00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:48.171]  The globalist bankers that control our government see the CIA's approach in Vietnam as a benchmark in undermining U.S.
[00:03:48.211 --> 00:03:48.751]  sovereignty.
[00:03:48.991 --> 00:04:02.595]  In just 14 years since 9-11, unleashing a degradation in the American Bill of Rights never before seen in our 239-year history, the fall of Saigon in 1975 marked the end of the Vietnam War.
[00:04:03.015 --> 00:04:06.917]  Communism won, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was born.
[00:04:07.237 --> 00:04:11.238]  The CIA lost the Vietnam War by targeting the citizenry.
[00:04:11.778 --> 00:04:20.314]  With the Jade Helm operations gearing up for the summer of 2015, treason's seat at the Table of Liberty just got a whole lot bigger.
[00:04:20.714 --> 00:04:22.978]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:04:30.253 --> 00:04:38.077]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:04:38.357 --> 00:04:40.438]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.220]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.402]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:04:47.722 --> 00:04:50.864]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:04:50.884 --> 00:04:58.168]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:04:58.348 --> 00:05:02.471]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:04.312]  We are the true media.
[00:05:04.452 --> 00:05:07.054]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:05:07.154 --> 00:05:10.836]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
