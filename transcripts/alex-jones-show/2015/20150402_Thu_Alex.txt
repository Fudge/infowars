[00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.173]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:15.957]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now already the second day, hard to believe, of April 2015.
[00:00:17.398 --> 00:00:21.481]  I'm back from my successful hernia surgery yesterday.
[00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:22.161]  Praise God.
[00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:23.182]  Thank you all for your prayers.
[00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:27.505]  Here's two excerpts of reports filed by Joe Biggs and John Bowman.
[00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:30.067]  We'll be back to kick off the main transmission.
[00:00:30.087 --> 00:00:30.528]  Stay with us.
[00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:39.090]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.313]  Now over the weekend, the 143rd Airborne Battalion conducted exercise at a North Regional Texas Airport.
[00:00:45.453 --> 00:00:54.617]  Soldiers hit the ground running Saturday morning, taking part in an assault landing exercise at the North Texas Regional Airport in Denison.
[00:00:55.097 --> 00:01:00.162]  We had a fictitious enemy situation in which we did detailed mission planning for said Lieutenant Colonel Krupp.
[00:01:00.503 --> 00:01:06.729]  We had a fictitious enemy situation in which we did detailed mission planning for.
[00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.833]  Why is Texas continuously being labeled as hostile?
[00:01:11.514 --> 00:01:13.994]  Why are all these enemy situations happening in Texas?
[00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:14.655]  What is going on?
[00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:17.655]  What is the military really truly planning for?
[00:01:18.355 --> 00:01:34.818]  And my other question is, we spend millions and millions of dollars in taxpayer money to build these training facilities on government property so the soldiers themselves and their officers can train without being bothered, without bothering other people and go about it in a professional manner.
[00:01:34.838 --> 00:01:37.179]  We have no problem with that because that's what the money is for.
[00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:44.620]  But there is a big problem when you start bringing these training exercises off of government property and into people's backyards.
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.342]  It is a conditioning, it is a sign up to get people used to seeing military presence every day.
[00:01:51.362 --> 00:02:02.204]  Around 250 of the over 800 soldiers in the battalion took part in the airfield seizure operations, learning to take down an enemy.
[00:02:02.524 --> 00:02:04.444]  But this exercise was different.
[00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:13.327]  In the video that we're going to go to, the lieutenant colonel even says that typically training like this does not happen off base, this happens on base.
[00:02:13.748 --> 00:02:26.132]  This is the reason we spend the money on these facilities and the fact that these guys are not using the facilities is why it's alarming that they keep moving all of a sudden from these bases and off into the civilian population.
[00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:32.115]  Typically training is done on an active military base, not a public airport.
[00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.900]  But the change in location benefits the soldiers.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.282]  It gives us a different look and a different piece of terrain to actually operate on.
[00:02:39.382 --> 00:02:40.682]  We're not doing this to scare people.
[00:02:40.722 --> 00:02:43.603]  We're doing this to bring awareness to the fact that this is conditioning.
[00:02:44.023 --> 00:02:50.286]  This is used as a psyop to get you, the public, to being used to seeing this kind of stuff happening all the time.
[00:02:50.626 --> 00:02:52.947]  So when it does happen, you're not quite ready.
[00:02:52.967 --> 00:02:55.488]  You just think it's another training operation.
[00:02:56.188 --> 00:03:03.555]  Inside of the house, they located a body of a male individual, Caucasian, mid-forties, who appeared to be deceased.
[00:03:03.575 --> 00:03:04.916]  They contacted paramedics.
[00:03:05.356 --> 00:03:05.496]  L.A.
[00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:10.300]  City paramedics responded, checked the individual, and confirmed that he was in fact deceased inside of the house.
[00:03:10.821 --> 00:03:16.486]  Andrew Getty, grandson and heir to the fortune of oil baron J. Paul Getty, is dead.
[00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:27.673]  A law enforcement source told the LA Times that Getty was found naked from the waist down in the bathroom of his Hollywood Hills estate and appeared to have suffered from some type of blunt force trauma.
[00:03:28.053 --> 00:03:32.176]  It's unclear whether the injury was caused by a fall or something else.
[00:03:32.716 --> 00:03:38.000]  A woman found in the Los Angeles home when Getty's body was discovered by police is being questioned.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:45.485]  The same woman, Andrew Getty, worth 2.1 billion dollars, sought a restraining order against two weeks ago.
[00:03:46.045 --> 00:03:51.887]  In 1966, the Guinness Book of World Records named J. Paul Getty the world's richest private citizen.
[00:03:52.147 --> 00:03:56.148]  Getty's legacy as a hoarder of wealth and antiquities is unparalleled.
[00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:05.932]  He was so miserly it cost him his grandson's right ear when he would not pay the Italian gangsters the 17 million dollar ransom they demanded.
[00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:11.534]  During the Great Depression, Getty shrewdly diversified his ownings, picking up American oil companies.
[00:04:11.754 --> 00:04:14.175]  Oil reserves were discovered in Saudi Arabia in 1938.
[00:04:15.815 --> 00:04:26.462]  Just 11 years later, Jay Paul Getty plunked down 9.5 million in cash on a tract of barren land on the border of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
[00:04:27.122 --> 00:04:33.326]  $30 million and four years later, that tract was producing 16 million barrels a year.
[00:04:33.767 --> 00:04:41.732]  The Russian oil goliath, Buchan, bought Getty Oil in 2000, sold it in 2011, and Getty Petroleum Oil spiraled into bankruptcy.
[00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.879]  An L.A.
[00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.340]  County coroner says the death appears to be from natural causes.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.721]  It was originally thought to be accidental because of medication found at the scene.
[00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:53.122]  Why blunt force trauma?
[00:04:53.382 --> 00:04:56.283]  Why is a hostile woman cooperating with the LAPD?
[00:04:56.603 --> 00:04:59.944]  Why were there massive amounts of blood all over the crime scene?
[00:05:00.204 --> 00:05:04.225]  And last but not least, was Andrew Getty really murdered?
[00:05:04.585 --> 00:05:07.286]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:05:07.626 --> 00:05:09.647]  Yeah, the blunt force trauma was to his rectum.
[00:05:09.727 --> 00:05:13.848]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:05:14.028 --> 00:05:17.989]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[00:05:36.775 --> 00:05:38.055]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:38.236 --> 00:05:49.443]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:05:49.644 --> 00:05:53.026]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:05:53.206 --> 00:05:54.207]  We're good.
[00:06:09.215 --> 00:06:10.095]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:06:10.135 --> 00:06:10.556]  Good, brother.
[00:06:10.716 --> 00:06:12.376]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:06:12.436 --> 00:06:14.217]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:06:14.377 --> 00:06:18.399]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.980]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.261]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:06:23.281 --> 00:06:31.325]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:06:31.505 --> 00:06:34.729]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:36.370]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.314]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:06:39.434 --> 00:06:40.795]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:06:41.096 --> 00:06:46.902]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:06:47.162 --> 00:06:48.764]  Or maximum potency.
[00:06:48.944 --> 00:07:00.896]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience where stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:07:00.956 --> 00:07:07.903]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:10.525]  Another major health threat.
[00:07:10.565 --> 00:07:15.447]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:07:15.527 --> 00:07:18.168]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:07:18.208 --> 00:07:24.970]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:28.112]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:07:28.272 --> 00:07:31.193]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:07:31.213 --> 00:07:33.194]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:07:33.214 --> 00:07:36.055]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:07:36.135 --> 00:07:41.636]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:07:41.856 --> 00:07:45.337]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:07:45.357 --> 00:07:48.358]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:07:48.458 --> 00:07:55.539]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:08:21.829 --> 00:08:29.553]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.671]  Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition!
[00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:37.964]  In the info war, I'm back!
[00:08:39.507 --> 00:08:42.809]  24 hours after hernia surgery, praise God, it went off really well.
[00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.953]  I'm just concerned I feel so good that I might end up busting internal or external stitches.
[00:08:48.073 --> 00:08:53.817]  I mean, I felt like a billion dollars yesterday after I had the surgery.
[00:08:54.017 --> 00:09:00.882]  I'm taking about half of the pain medication that I'm supposed to take, and I don't even think by tomorrow I'll need pain medication.
[00:09:01.402 --> 00:09:04.464]  Getting out of the car today, walking into the office, I had a little bit of pain.
[00:09:04.484 --> 00:09:06.926]  I have a little bit now, but it's just amazing.
[00:09:07.845 --> 00:09:16.989]  The developments in MD surgery that are out there, and that's where I believe in MD medicine, as I've always have, is truly catastrophic stuff.
[00:09:17.029 --> 00:09:22.211]  Broken legs, hernias, gunshot wounds, root canals, all of it.
[00:09:22.431 --> 00:09:23.692]  Amazing science.
[00:09:24.719 --> 00:09:27.140]  And if you shop around and find the best surgeon.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.381]  So really, they did a great job at Seton Outpatient Medical Center.
[00:09:31.822 --> 00:09:33.502]  Dr. Livingston did the surgery.
[00:09:34.303 --> 00:09:39.664]  And I know a lot of folks have had problems, obviously, because nothing's perfect in this world with hernia surgeries.
[00:09:40.005 --> 00:09:41.565]  And all doctors are not created equal.
[00:09:41.965 --> 00:09:45.827]  But praise God, it has been miraculous how good I feel.
[00:09:46.867 --> 00:09:50.529]  I'm very, very thankful for your prayers, because hernia surgeries can go bad.
[00:09:50.909 --> 00:10:02.516]  They had to... I literally had intestines sticking out of a peritoneal hernia in my belly button, because it had gotten bigger over 14 years, from the size of a pencil eraser to the size of a silver dollar.
[00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:05.057]  And it was bad.
[00:10:05.537 --> 00:10:07.639]  Could have basically killed me if it pinched the gut.
[00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:09.960]  Killed my guts, that is.
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.302]  And then I'd have to... I had something like a...
[00:10:14.793 --> 00:10:15.633]  Colostomy bag.
[00:10:16.053 --> 00:10:24.216]  So it's a good thing that I got over my phobia of surgery after I had a bad experience when I was 16 and got in there and got it done before I continued to pinch my intestine.
[00:10:24.836 --> 00:10:34.100]  They had to bring me down to the lowest level of sedation where they even turned my lungs off so that all the muscles would loosen up so they could do it properly and not hurt me more.
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.281]  And so I was pretty much basically almost dead.
[00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:40.362]  I was on a respirator yesterday for the hour long surgery.
[00:10:40.982 --> 00:10:43.844]  That's never happened in my life, but I just feel so good.
[00:10:44.384 --> 00:10:45.725]  And it's not the pain medication.
[00:10:45.765 --> 00:10:49.688]  I'm on one hydrocodone every six hours instead of two.
[00:10:49.708 --> 00:10:53.570]  And I got up this morning and hadn't been on it for 10 hours and felt great.
[00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.012]  Then I kind of hurt walking around, so I took one.
[00:10:56.052 --> 00:10:57.372]  So it's not the pain medication.
[00:10:58.353 --> 00:11:02.556]  I've been on hydrocodone before for a broken leg and things like that and hated it.
[00:11:02.656 --> 00:11:04.557]  So, just miraculous.
[00:11:05.237 --> 00:11:06.978]  Maybe I was so stressed out, it was like a reset.
[00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:08.760]  Turn the computer off, turn it back on.
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.643]  But man, I feel 10 years younger and it's just a miracle basically.
[00:11:13.943 --> 00:11:18.406]  So thank you all for your prayers and great job to the surgeon, at least so far.
[00:11:18.906 --> 00:11:21.368]  But he is rated top of the state right here in Austin.
[00:11:21.808 --> 00:11:24.570]  I got the top guy rated by WebMD and the rest of it.
[00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.373]  So I want to put a big shout out and thank him as well.
[00:11:30.574 --> 00:11:32.055]  Does 15 hernia surgeries a week.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:33.980]  Did I?
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.703]  Showing what happened in the month, I guess I went further, 45 days.
[00:11:56.723 --> 00:11:59.185]  Forgot about the ad I was going to do, so now it'll be 45 days.
[00:11:59.205 --> 00:12:02.127]  45 days later, I lost another 6-7 pounds.
[00:12:02.407 --> 00:12:06.210]  But what was most important is, I got a big head, folks.
[00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:11.134]  And I've got, obviously, stress and cortisol has released my body.
[00:12:11.354 --> 00:12:12.735]  So I have a little bit of jowls left.
[00:12:12.975 --> 00:12:16.097]  But my gut, you can actually see the six-pack now.
[00:12:17.038 --> 00:12:18.039]  See the six-pack.
[00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:20.761]  That's why the hernia got worse, because it was all just sucking in.
[00:12:22.602 --> 00:12:24.804]  I thought you lost weight and they got better, but it was the opposite effect.
[00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:41.379]  That photos there that we took last Friday, or a group of photos, I want to mesh that with photos of myself five years ago when I hit almost 280, 279, and then right through losing 40 plus pounds, and then losing that final six, seven pounds, the six pack.
[00:12:41.539 --> 00:12:48.226]  I mean, we've got it where I actually have a six pack with a tiny bit of fat right on each side, and a little bit on, I mean, it's just amazing.
[00:12:49.082 --> 00:12:50.882]  What Super Mel Vitality has done for me.
[00:12:50.943 --> 00:12:52.623]  I'm not trying to go off and do a jag here.
[00:12:53.123 --> 00:12:59.425]  It's just that was the final part of the equation along with the nascent iodine and the Infowarslife.com products.
[00:12:59.485 --> 00:13:02.385]  So I'm going to voice that today at 2 o'clock.
[00:13:02.405 --> 00:13:03.166]  Just a quick ad.
[00:13:03.986 --> 00:13:04.726]  Explaining that to people.
[00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:11.668]  I'm going off on this jag with all this incredible world news just because I'm so glad to be alive.
[00:13:12.864 --> 00:13:15.525]  When I was 16, I got my leg broken.
[00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:16.446]  I had to have a pin.
[00:13:16.966 --> 00:13:17.867]  I've told this story before.
[00:13:18.507 --> 00:13:23.690]  And they had to give me nine times the medication to put me under.
[00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.851]  I kept waking up on the operating table.
[00:13:26.971 --> 00:13:27.812]  They had to restrain me.
[00:13:28.252 --> 00:13:28.972]  I remember part of it.
[00:13:29.693 --> 00:13:31.013]  And then I still was waking up.
[00:13:31.634 --> 00:13:35.075]  And they just basically finished the procedure with me growling at them and snapping.
[00:13:35.335 --> 00:13:36.536]  Because they were scared to give me more.
[00:13:36.556 --> 00:13:40.038]  And they already had my leg open and the pin in from the compound fracture.
[00:13:41.015 --> 00:13:42.096]  It wasn't a total compound fracture.
[00:13:42.136 --> 00:13:47.279]  They have another name for it where it doesn't come out of the skin, but it basically comes within, you know, a tenth of a millimeter.
[00:13:47.379 --> 00:13:48.740]  It's called a spiral fracture.
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:49.741]  A spiral fracture.
[00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:52.583]  CJ literally knows everything.
[00:13:52.923 --> 00:13:57.986]  I had a spiral fracture, a big long one down the side, and they had to fix it and put a bunch of screws and stuff in there.
[00:13:58.747 --> 00:14:00.848]  And it was hell on earth.
[00:14:00.988 --> 00:14:04.651]  I mean, I was alive, awake for surgery.
[00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:07.942]  It's like a Slayer song.
[00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:12.545]  Surgery with no anesthesia, rain blood, angel of death flying free.
[00:14:12.565 --> 00:14:13.365]  It was not fun.
[00:14:14.226 --> 00:14:14.866]  Needless to say.
[00:14:14.886 --> 00:14:17.988]  I mean, I remember the surgeon cussing.
[00:14:18.628 --> 00:14:20.849]  He had a heart attack and died two weeks later.
[00:14:21.369 --> 00:14:22.510]  I'm not saying I did that to him.
[00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:26.492]  He was a former NFL player, the top orthopedic surgeon in Dallas.
[00:14:26.973 --> 00:14:28.733]  So my dad got me a really great guy.
[00:14:28.773 --> 00:14:33.036]  He had a heart attack like a week and a half later and then died about a week after that, I guess.
[00:14:34.329 --> 00:14:38.592]  But the point is, I remember this huge surgeon going, God, with DD, what's going on here?
[00:14:38.673 --> 00:14:39.553]  And what are you doing?
[00:14:39.613 --> 00:14:42.676]  And they said they never saw anything like it, the thrashing, the fighting.
[00:14:42.936 --> 00:14:53.625]  But then I was talking to this anesthesiologist, this doctor, who was a listener it turned out, who I actually knew through one of our sources at the University of Texas in the psychology department from a film we made.
[00:14:55.446 --> 00:14:59.930]  And I'd had drinks with him like 15 years ago a couple times at parties.
[00:15:01.215 --> 00:15:05.201]  And he said, don't worry, the new stuff will give you a regular dose.
[00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.282]  I predict it's going to knock you out.
[00:15:06.302 --> 00:15:12.411]  We'll give you some other stuff to basically turn your lungs off and get all your muscles relaxed.
[00:15:14.193 --> 00:15:16.236]  And he came in at the end, he goes, no, it took double.
[00:15:17.048 --> 00:15:17.608]  It took double.
[00:15:18.508 --> 00:15:19.449]  Sorry I'm harping on this.
[00:15:19.489 --> 00:15:20.489]  I've got all this news to cover.
[00:15:20.849 --> 00:15:23.630]  It was just so interesting that he was like, that's a lot.
[00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:28.592]  We gave you, you know, for a 235 pound man, we gave you a good dose.
[00:15:28.632 --> 00:15:31.693]  And then it took four pins, not two.
[00:15:32.713 --> 00:15:35.454]  Four injections full to keep me under.
[00:15:36.414 --> 00:15:39.595]  So I don't know what's going on with my physiology, but it's not nine times.
[00:15:40.456 --> 00:15:41.436]  And then they were unsuccessful.
[00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:44.597]  Basically, they gave me enough to kill a horse and it wouldn't work.
[00:15:45.765 --> 00:15:47.866]  That didn't happen yesterday, so thank God!
[00:15:47.886 --> 00:15:49.686]  Can you imagine why I was scared?
[00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:51.987]  But I just got up and did it, so thank you.
[00:15:52.447 --> 00:15:56.209]  I'm not scared of a lot of stuff, but I was scared of leaving my kids behind, leaving the info war behind.
[00:15:57.369 --> 00:15:57.969]  But I'm here.
[00:15:57.989 --> 00:16:00.810]  Again, not the surgery I was worried about, but the anesthesia.
[00:16:02.331 --> 00:16:05.792]  There is so much news to cover, it is all off the charts, as usual.
[00:16:09.898 --> 00:16:14.802]  Remember a couple years ago the amazing statements in Reuters of all places?
[00:16:15.383 --> 00:16:22.208]  Interpol chief armed citizens globally to prevent terror attacks, he said, do like western and southern states in the U.S.
[00:16:22.268 --> 00:16:30.655]  and Vermont has done, have open or concealed carry to stop Islamic Jihad, Al-Qaeda attacks.
[00:16:32.757 --> 00:16:33.177]  Amazing.
[00:16:34.398 --> 00:16:34.959]  Common sense.
[00:16:36.581 --> 00:16:44.658]  Well, now we've had the very group, Islamic State, that's who runs this group in Kenya, go into a Christian college and kill 15 people.
[00:16:46.874 --> 00:16:50.115]  And the Christian College is nice and open, so it allows Muslims to go there as well.
[00:16:50.355 --> 00:16:51.456]  They would ask, are you Muslim?
[00:16:51.896 --> 00:16:54.937]  And they would ask you to quote different parts of the Koran.
[00:16:55.037 --> 00:16:57.658]  If you didn't, they would blow your head off with pleasure.
[00:16:58.478 --> 00:17:01.259]  And Obama will not call them radical Islamists.
[00:17:01.319 --> 00:17:09.762]  He will not even say radical, but they'll spend all day on MSNBC saying, arrest the Tea Party, indict everyone, and they've decided not to investigate Lois Lerner.
[00:17:10.063 --> 00:17:11.083]  All charges have been dropped.
[00:17:12.318 --> 00:17:23.426]  So they're going to persecute Christians, and then let Islamic State, that's what it is, under a new name, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda Islamic State, come in, kill 15 people, and they've promised to hit the U.S.
[00:17:23.446 --> 00:17:29.351]  Remember a month ago, the FBI said, all 50 states have ISIS in them.
[00:17:30.332 --> 00:17:30.772]  And guess what?
[00:17:30.832 --> 00:17:31.192]  They do.
[00:17:31.993 --> 00:17:40.639]  They're all over the internet, they're real people, they're threatening us on a routine basis, to the point of there's been Austin Police Department investigations, I'm not supposed to say more than that,
[00:17:41.616 --> 00:17:44.560]  But we actually have these people running around in Austin.
[00:17:45.941 --> 00:17:47.083]  It's a total infiltration.
[00:17:48.424 --> 00:17:50.527]  This government is treason at the top.
[00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:56.895]  They're gonna use these crises and the stinger missiles Hillary Clinton gave them from Benghazi and she's not getting in trouble.
[00:17:58.497 --> 00:17:59.338]  Makes me so angry.
[00:18:00.757 --> 00:18:14.985]  Islamic gunmen, and you see it in the news now, they're threatening other reporters, they're threatening police departments, and ISIS just gets to sit there and do whatever they want because they're not even extreme when they killed 300 plus thousand people under the Al Qaeda banner in Libya and Syria in the last five years.
[00:18:15.665 --> 00:18:18.947]  Islamic gunmen stormed Kenyan college, killed 15 Christians targeted.
[00:18:20.088 --> 00:18:22.069]  This is out of CNN.
[00:18:22.229 --> 00:18:28.073]  Kenyan soldiers take cover as shots are fired in front of the Darissa University College
[00:18:29.093 --> 00:18:34.715]  At least 15 people were killed today when a swarm of gunmen stormed the university before dawn.
[00:18:36.656 --> 00:18:37.396]  And it goes over it.
[00:18:38.077 --> 00:18:43.839]  Any Al-Qaeda gunmen come around here, we got every door covered.
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.280]  I mean, Al-Qaeda can show up in an armored vehicle.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.821]  We got two Barrett's ready.
[00:18:49.727 --> 00:18:50.688]  Lapua's ready.
[00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:52.690]  M4's ready.
[00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:54.072]  Riot shotgun's ready.
[00:18:54.652 --> 00:18:55.393]  Whole nine yards.
[00:18:55.453 --> 00:18:59.517]  And we don't think that's going to happen because they don't attack hard targets.
[00:19:00.158 --> 00:19:01.419]  They attack soft targets.
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.563]  We've got... I put in armored doors now.
[00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:07.185]  Oh, that's right.
[00:19:08.707 --> 00:19:11.290]  So, that's just how we operate in Texas.
[00:19:15.253 --> 00:19:17.674]  But not in places where the citizens can't own guns.
[00:19:17.954 --> 00:19:20.955]  And in Kenya, they're calling for arming citizens.
[00:19:21.196 --> 00:19:26.578]  That men and women who want to go take a quick week-long course can then be given a government-registered gun.
[00:19:27.038 --> 00:19:35.902]  And that's not perfect, but at least they're recognizing the answer is arming the good guys to take out the bad guys so you don't just sit there and get down in a ditch and have your head blown off.
[00:19:36.982 --> 00:19:39.183]  I mean, I've got firearms right here.
[00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:41.364]  People think that's so alien.
[00:19:41.464 --> 00:19:43.465]  No, I'm not a prey.
[00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:45.442]  I'm not a predator either.
[00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:46.242]  I'm a sheepdog.
[00:19:47.143 --> 00:19:48.543]  By the way, I've always used that allegory.
[00:19:48.583 --> 00:19:50.584]  It's an old Texas allegory.
[00:19:50.624 --> 00:19:51.484]  It's not just in Texas.
[00:19:52.044 --> 00:19:53.505]  I didn't get that from American Sniper.
[00:19:54.425 --> 00:19:56.906]  That's art imitating life, but it's true.
[00:19:57.566 --> 00:19:58.486]  I've got teeth.
[00:19:59.646 --> 00:20:00.507]  I'm ready to bite.
[00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:04.608]  I'm not attacking the sheep, but I'm not a wolf.
[00:20:05.568 --> 00:20:06.788]  And wolves better watch it.
[00:20:06.948 --> 00:20:09.009]  We are trying to raise a world of sheepdogs.
[00:20:09.818 --> 00:20:16.641]  By now you know that wireless technology like cell phones do in fact pose dangers to the health and privacy of everyone.

[00:24:45.491 --> 00:24:49.892]  Hey Bobby, share the secrets of my soul.
[00:24:50.652 --> 00:24:55.553]  Through all kinds of weather, through everything we've done.
[00:24:55.773 --> 00:24:56.814]  Hey Bobby, baby,
[00:24:59.693 --> 00:25:03.476]  Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
[00:25:04.097 --> 00:25:14.506]  By the way, we had one of the heirs to John Paul Getty, Andrew Getty, to show you how these globalists end up, dying from traumatic injury to the rectal area.
[00:25:15.547 --> 00:25:21.792]  Andrew Getty took so much cocaine, according to the Daily Mail and Witnesses, I wouldn't be surprised if his heart just gave out.
[00:25:21.932 --> 00:25:26.896]  Old friend reveals the party-hard lifestyle of oil heir who died in his mansion.
[00:25:27.847 --> 00:25:38.674]  Yeah, I was out in California last weekend and was in some of these Hollywood circles, and I tell you, it is very sad to see what power and money does to most people.
[00:25:41.155 --> 00:25:50.220]  And, of course, it was John Paul Getty, the oil baron who brought Arnold Schwarzenegger to England and then to the United States.
[00:25:50.321 --> 00:25:51.601]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:25:52.382 --> 00:25:57.385]  But I guess his tastes were a little different than his grandson's, who likes women.
[00:25:59.081 --> 00:25:59.602]  Just saying.
[00:25:59.782 --> 00:26:04.825]  I mean, it's okay that Hillary likes women or Schwarzenegger was on the cover of gay porno mags.
[00:26:05.986 --> 00:26:12.270]  I just don't want to hear the Democrats always claiming that the Republican Party is homophobic when most of the leadership is homosexual.
[00:26:13.451 --> 00:26:20.976]  And that's how they blackmail them using these strictures to follow along with the entire globalist program.
[00:26:22.041 --> 00:26:22.842]  But here it is.
[00:26:22.862 --> 00:26:24.103]  Paramedics found Getty bleeding.
[00:26:24.123 --> 00:26:26.765]  I saw that in the LA Times, but here it is in the Daily Mail.
[00:26:27.025 --> 00:26:28.886]  From traumatic injury to the rectal area.
[00:26:30.187 --> 00:26:34.010]  So, looks like he was probably having a little too much fun with his girlfriend.
[00:26:36.271 --> 00:26:38.273]  So, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:38.873 --> 00:26:41.715]  Just not a senseless piece of tabloid news.
[00:26:42.316 --> 00:26:46.499]  I don't normally cover things like that, but
[00:26:47.441 --> 00:27:03.364]  When it ties into the Gettys, who are big New World Order globalists, and so stingy that the main baron would make family when they stayed at his house, make phone calls on a payphone he had in the living room, and pay like a hotel
[00:27:04.591 --> 00:27:09.236]  Hundreds of dollars a night, that's a couple of thousands today, to stay in one of the rooms.
[00:27:10.037 --> 00:27:13.621]  Even though he was the quote, richest man on paper in the world.
[00:27:14.222 --> 00:27:15.984]  These are the type of people we're talking about.
[00:27:16.465 --> 00:27:18.267]  In fact, at Bilderberg, they never tip.
[00:27:19.719 --> 00:27:22.842]  People like Hillary and others that comes out in the news do not give tips.
[00:27:23.082 --> 00:27:38.939]  They're all about love and liberalness and then you catch them fencing blood out of prisons to Canada to give over a million people HIV and hepatitis as well as other deadly pathogens.
[00:27:40.009 --> 00:27:41.750]  Remember the whole blood scandal of the 90s?
[00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.910]  I mean, you name it.
[00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:47.331]  Raiding half the money that was given for kids in Haiti.
[00:27:48.211 --> 00:27:49.752]  Comes out in the news, nobody gets in trouble.
[00:27:49.992 --> 00:27:50.472]  The Clintons.
[00:27:51.552 --> 00:27:52.773]  Murders all around them.
[00:27:53.473 --> 00:27:54.793]  Just incredible corruption.
[00:27:59.935 --> 00:28:02.996]  Hillary going after cocktail waitresses, two, three at a time.
[00:28:04.653 --> 00:28:06.395]  That's not chauvinistic, because she's a woman.
[00:28:06.435 --> 00:28:08.197]  See, they're above the law.
[00:28:08.537 --> 00:28:09.639]  They are the liberals.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:20.231]  So, if they want to feed your kids rotten food, literally slated to be fed to pigs, we have that news report coming up, video Michelle Obama's healthy lunches are literally pig food.
[00:28:21.892 --> 00:28:23.554]  If they want to do all that, it's A-OK.
[00:28:24.952 --> 00:28:27.433]  If Hillary doesn't want to tip people, it's A-OK.
[00:28:28.194 --> 00:28:30.555]  If they want to skimp out on bills, it's A-OK.
[00:28:31.055 --> 00:28:35.658]  And then you get to pay for the Clinton's New Year's vacation to the Dominican Republic.
[00:28:36.894 --> 00:28:43.121]  Even though he's a former president, over $100,000 for Hillary and all of her friends to go have a good time.
[00:28:43.301 --> 00:28:45.803]  That's nothing compared to the tens of millions every time Obama goes somewhere.
[00:28:46.224 --> 00:28:55.213]  It's just this corrupt, ruling class that then criticizes capitalism and the middle class, and the middle class wanting to have nice houses of swimming pools and cars.
[00:28:55.794 --> 00:28:58.397]  And tells Africans you can't have air conditioning or a car.
[00:28:59.232 --> 00:29:01.173]  Not, we should get clean cars and air conditioning.
[00:29:01.393 --> 00:29:02.994]  No, you can't have it!
[00:29:03.695 --> 00:29:05.716]  Because if you have it, you might get uppity.
[00:29:06.497 --> 00:29:10.999]  If you have it, you might start actually wanting to get politically involved.
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.001]  And we don't want you to have any money to be self-sufficient.
[00:29:14.041 --> 00:29:18.584]  We want you under our control like slaves back in a pen.
[00:29:19.365 --> 00:29:20.886]  That's how the Romans controlled slaves.
[00:29:21.186 --> 00:29:24.028]  It's how slavery was done in this country, is you kept people illiterate.
[00:29:24.932 --> 00:29:33.732]  And you kept him at a subservient, subsistence level, and you broke the men up from the women, and you kept the women as the house slaves over the men.
[00:29:35.646 --> 00:29:47.856]  That's Modern Feminism is directly translated out of a Roman slave manual on controlling Gaul and Germanic slaves, then translated into French over 350 years ago for Caribbean sugarcane plantations.
[00:29:48.677 --> 00:29:49.237]  You can look it up.
[00:29:49.397 --> 00:29:50.978]  We'll do a report on that, dig it back up.
[00:29:51.459 --> 00:29:56.743]  And then translated into Modern Feminism today is a Roman plantation manual.
[00:29:57.043 --> 00:29:57.464]  Stay with us.
[00:29:58.928 --> 00:29:59.829]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.329 --> 00:30:01.930]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.631]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.694 --> 00:30:10.694]  The experts are clear.
[00:30:11.014 --> 00:30:17.978]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:30:18.118 --> 00:30:24.381]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:30:24.401 --> 00:30:27.983]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:30:28.123 --> 00:30:32.026]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:30:32.326 --> 00:30:37.390]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:38.551]  Not our iodine.
[00:30:38.671 --> 00:30:44.815]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:29.087]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:31:29.267 --> 00:31:32.189]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[00:31:32.329 --> 00:31:32.589]  I think so.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:00.184]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.

[00:32:10.737 --> 00:32:11.798]  In the near future.
[00:32:12.058 --> 00:32:15.721]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:32:15.741 --> 00:32:16.221]  Security alert.
[00:32:16.581 --> 00:32:17.582]  Security alert.
[00:32:17.802 --> 00:32:19.523]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:32:19.803 --> 00:32:20.424]  Analysis.
[00:32:20.704 --> 00:32:21.324]  InfoWars.
[00:32:21.404 --> 00:32:23.366]  Building independent media operations.
[00:32:23.386 --> 00:32:28.369]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:29.330]  Prime Directive.
[00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:30.851]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:32:30.971 --> 00:32:33.773]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:36.915]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:32:37.075 --> 00:32:39.237]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:32:39.377 --> 00:32:40.857]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:32:40.897 --> 00:32:43.038]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:32:43.058 --> 00:32:45.379]  They are never going to stop.
[00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:49.580]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.881]  Block free iPhone app at InfoWars.com.
[00:32:53.341 --> 00:32:55.962]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[00:32:56.662 --> 00:32:57.402]  Imperative.
[00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:59.643]  Destroy PrismLinux TV.
[00:32:59.683 --> 00:33:04.084]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:33:04.364 --> 00:33:05.725]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:33:05.745 --> 00:33:06.505]  You can feel it.
[00:33:20.242 --> 00:33:22.403]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:22.903 --> 00:33:28.066]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:33:52.577 --> 00:33:53.257]  We are wrong.
[00:33:53.577 --> 00:33:54.478]  We are GO.
[00:33:54.878 --> 00:33:57.739]  The Emergency Organic Human Beacon.
[00:33:58.519 --> 00:33:59.480]  It is the Infowar.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:14.226]  It's made up of myself, our crew, and every man, woman, and child across this globe that wants to understand the scientific, technocratic takeover that has been designed, publicly announced, and is being launched against humanity currently.
[00:34:18.427 --> 00:34:19.468]  Here's how my brain works.
[00:34:20.148 --> 00:34:21.469]  I get up at about 6.30 this morning.
[00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:28.411]  I go down to the government computer interface, that's what the internet is.
[00:34:28.431 --> 00:34:39.279]  I interface with InfoWars.com on that DARPA system and I am aware of the surveillance grid the entire time I am.
[00:34:39.959 --> 00:34:49.466]  And I then notice the headline on InfoWars.com, And DrudgeReport.com, Islamic gunman storm Kenyan college, 15 killed, Christians targeted.
[00:34:50.339 --> 00:34:55.660]  And I read the article with the latest updates and then I immediately remember, boom!
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:12.543]  When they attacked the mall a couple years ago, killing a huge amount of people, much larger than this attack, asking if they were Christians and then killing them, the media first tried to just say they weren't just targeting Christians.
[00:35:12.983 --> 00:35:14.143]  That's the political correctness.
[00:35:14.623 --> 00:35:17.424]  And Obama, of course, came out and said there is not such a thing as radical Islam.
[00:35:17.704 --> 00:35:19.524]  We will not even call it terrorism.
[00:35:20.865 --> 00:35:22.045]  And he said it again recently.
[00:35:23.225 --> 00:35:40.509]  And then I remember the Interpol chief coming out with a moment of sanity, a tiny light in a vast ocean of dark fraud, and the headline, Interpol Chief, and of course we have it from Infowars.com, we can pull it up in Reuters, that's where it was, let's pull up the original article if we can, Armed Citizens Globally to Prevent Terror Attacks.
[00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:44.890]  Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble said something noble.
[00:35:46.015 --> 00:35:51.780]  He told ABC News that one of the only ways to prevent terrorists from hitting soft targets was to arm citizens globally.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:59.927]  Noting that the Westgate Mall siege would have averted and would have been over far quicker if it had taken place in gun friendly areas like Denver or Texas.
[00:36:00.908 --> 00:36:04.211]  Showing he doesn't really get his social topography down correctly.
[00:36:04.251 --> 00:36:09.615]  Denver's not as free as it used to be, but let's just say Vermont or Texas or Arizona.
[00:36:10.456 --> 00:36:13.759]  And that's why these Islamists don't hit those targets.
[00:36:14.534 --> 00:36:28.649]  Because I'll assure you, you hit a mall in Texas, you're going to have probably, if it's a full mall, a hundred good ol' boys who aren't going to wait around the corner under their training like the police.
[00:36:29.329 --> 00:36:32.633]  And I'm not knocking that training, but they train a lot of the cops to wait for backup.
[00:36:32.893 --> 00:36:34.094]  Some departments they charge in.
[00:36:34.114 --> 00:36:35.416]  A lot of cops do charge in.
[00:36:36.328 --> 00:36:46.010]  But in Texas, when you had the tower shooting, citizens just pulled up, got their deer rifles out, started shooting to pin him down, or he would have probably killed double, the police estimated.
[00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:54.652]  Then a citizen found an Austin cop, who I've had on the show, he's now a Texas Ranger, retired, and the citizen's dad, I forget his name, my grandpa knew him, and said, let's go!
[00:36:57.112 --> 00:36:59.793]  Grabbed his shotgun out of his truck, grabbed the cop and said, let's go!
[00:37:00.153 --> 00:37:01.833]  And they stormed up the tower and took him out.
[00:37:04.534 --> 00:37:17.900]  And I'm nothing special, but I guarantee you, if somebody was, say, mass shooting across the street, it wouldn't even... The default is, I'd grab an M4, run out the door, and open fire on them.
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:21.201]  I mean, just guaranteed, instantly, that's my default.
[00:37:21.721 --> 00:37:23.602]  That is now a bizarre instinct.
[00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:33.266]  I've had the BBC and others here, when they see under my desk an AK-47, you know, semi-auto, or they see an M4, or they see a .357 Magnum,
[00:37:34.318 --> 00:37:36.980]  And they go, what is that?
[00:37:38.461 --> 00:37:39.442]  I mean, I'm not exaggerating.
[00:37:39.482 --> 00:37:40.183]  It's worse than that.
[00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:41.083]  Stop the taping.
[00:37:41.404 --> 00:37:41.884]  Excuse me.
[00:37:43.766 --> 00:37:51.452]  They've been brainwashed so conditioned with psychological triggers that the sign of a slave with a gun scares them to the point of almost collapsing.
[00:37:53.399 --> 00:37:55.140]  And it's the same thing you see over and over again.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:38:05.907]  I told the story of my dad's college friend, who I've been on probably, not to exaggerate, 15 camping and fishing trips and beach trips with in my life, or more.
[00:38:08.188 --> 00:38:08.849]  I was in college.
[00:38:08.889 --> 00:38:10.310]  My dad had a gun safe in his closet.
[00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:14.012]  I didn't keep my really nice guns at my apartment because they could get stolen.
[00:38:14.632 --> 00:38:17.214]  I was getting some guns to go to the shooting range and then hunting later.
[00:38:17.734 --> 00:38:19.756]  And I was just walking out of their bedroom, past the living room,
[00:38:20.759 --> 00:38:22.059]  With a rifle and a handgun.
[00:38:22.359 --> 00:38:23.220]  The handgun was in a case.
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:24.560]  Memory serves.
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:50.308]  And he just went, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[00:38:51.198 --> 00:38:58.205]  And I've experienced this, but see, here's the Interpol chief saying, arm people all over the world like this, and it will stop the mass shootings.
[00:38:58.225 --> 00:38:58.806]  Of course it will.
[00:38:59.667 --> 00:39:01.088]  We're going to trust pilots.
[00:39:02.389 --> 00:39:03.531]  With how much does a 747 weigh?
[00:39:03.551 --> 00:39:04.191]  How many tons is it?
[00:39:04.211 --> 00:39:05.012]  Is it a 50 ton torpedo?
[00:39:11.427 --> 00:39:11.687]  100 ton?
[00:39:11.867 --> 00:39:12.247]  300 ton?
[00:39:12.527 --> 00:39:14.128]  Tell me how much a 777 weighs.
[00:39:14.168 --> 00:39:20.030]  You're going to trust them with this giant torpedo that flies 580 miles an hour.
[00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:24.031]  They can actually go over 600, close to the speed of sound, but they don't do that because of the gas it uses.
[00:39:24.051 --> 00:39:27.852]  In fact, some of those big jets I'm told can actually break the sound barrier.
[00:39:28.653 --> 00:39:38.656]  The point is, is that you've got a missile that goes 600 miles an hour, you can fly it into buildings, you can kill tens of thousands with it, but we're not going to trust the pilots with a gun.
[00:39:40.595 --> 00:39:41.775]  See, the world's not perfect.
[00:39:42.015 --> 00:39:52.817]  So they harden the doors so a guy on Prozac, a man on Prozac, can be depressed and want to show off to his girlfriend and fly it into the ground.
[00:39:53.137 --> 00:39:54.878]  Then the answer is have everything remote controlled.
[00:39:55.098 --> 00:40:00.759]  Oh, what happens when a crazy person in the government who controls that comm center flies all the planes into the ground?
[00:40:00.839 --> 00:40:06.080]  See, the more you try to restrict people, you only restrict good people so bad people can act.
[00:40:07.398 --> 00:40:08.958]  The cockpit's now hardened.
[00:40:09.919 --> 00:40:11.079]  Allow this to happen.
[00:40:11.759 --> 00:40:13.580]  So you close one door, it opens another door.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.320]  How many tons is a 777 weigh, guys?
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.321]  Not even loaded with fuel?
[00:40:18.681 --> 00:40:19.321]  We didn't find it.
[00:40:19.341 --> 00:40:19.902]  We're still looking.
[00:40:20.722 --> 00:40:22.002]  Just search the term.
[00:40:22.322 --> 00:40:23.363]  How much does a 777 weigh?
[00:40:23.483 --> 00:40:26.864]  Yeah, that's what I did, but we're not having any luck with the results.
[00:40:26.884 --> 00:40:27.084]  Okay.
[00:40:28.144 --> 00:40:33.185]  Well, I was on... According to Boeing, the maximum takeoff weight is 660,000 pounds.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:36.600]  I believe.
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.981]  660,000 pounds?
[00:40:38.001 --> 00:40:39.102]  That can't be.
[00:40:39.142 --> 00:40:40.043]  That's too many tons.
[00:40:41.685 --> 00:40:42.505]  Well, we're going to find out.
[00:40:42.545 --> 00:40:43.686]  The point is planes are big.
[00:40:44.567 --> 00:40:45.188]  I'll look it up.
[00:40:45.688 --> 00:40:47.369]  You guys are great, but let me just see if I can find it.
[00:40:48.791 --> 00:40:49.251]  Oh, there it is.
[00:40:49.291 --> 00:40:51.173]  It says 660,000 pounds.
[00:40:51.193 --> 00:40:51.973]  So how many tons is that?
[00:40:51.993 --> 00:40:52.414]  660,000 pounds.
[00:40:52.434 --> 00:40:53.034]  330 tons.
[00:40:53.054 --> 00:40:53.214]  330 tons.
[00:40:53.254 --> 00:40:53.795]  Yeah, I was on a...
[00:41:05.188 --> 00:41:19.459]  American Airlines flight, and that's what they said, they talked about, when you're on our 777s, you're flying through the air, and I was on a 777, it was just an ad, in a 300 ton aircraft, and I wanted to, I almost said 300 ton, but it just sounded so big I didn't believe it.
[00:41:19.479 --> 00:41:26.824]  300 ton plus missile, that goes 600 miles per hour.
[00:41:30.242 --> 00:41:32.946]  And we're going to keep pilots from having guns.
[00:41:33.346 --> 00:41:36.951]  We're going to keep citizens from having guns so the bad guys can get the guns.
[00:41:37.312 --> 00:41:38.994]  So the bad guys can take action.
[00:41:41.838 --> 00:41:42.919]  What do they claim the top speed?
[00:41:42.939 --> 00:41:43.880]  It'll depend on the engines in a 777.
[00:41:45.435 --> 00:41:52.238]  But I know I was on one flying to England one time on a continental out of Houston, and it was kilometers.
[00:41:52.318 --> 00:41:58.780]  But it said, when I woke up in the middle of the night, it said like 780 kilometers an hour.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.921]  I guess that's 600 and something.
[00:41:59.981 --> 00:42:00.281]  I don't know.
[00:42:02.462 --> 00:42:03.202]  What's his top speed?
[00:42:05.525 --> 00:42:08.967]  Looks like 945, 945 kilometers.
[00:42:08.987 --> 00:42:12.108]  945 kilometers, and then if you reduce that down to miles, what is that?
[00:42:12.128 --> 00:42:14.249]  The point is, they're faster than 600 miles an hour.
[00:42:14.849 --> 00:42:17.330]  So you got a 600, see I'm obsessing on factoids, sorry.
[00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:20.391]  600 mile an hour, 300 plus ton weapon.
[00:42:24.761 --> 00:42:27.462]  And now they're saying, have them all remote control, can't trust humans.
[00:42:27.683 --> 00:42:31.825]  See, one human does something bad, now all of us have to lose our freedoms.
[00:42:32.005 --> 00:42:33.626]  Every pilot is now a criminal.
[00:42:34.386 --> 00:42:41.690]  Even though statistically, everyone knows that jet pilots have one of the highest levels of competency, one of the highest levels of low crime rate.
[00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:46.252]  But, one does something bad, now we've got to change everything.
[00:42:48.313 --> 00:42:49.734]  Alright, I'm perseverating.
[00:42:50.074 --> 00:42:51.174]  That's how my brain works.
[00:42:51.354 --> 00:42:52.055]  I see an article,
[00:42:54.190 --> 00:43:06.985]  About the latest Kenya mass murder with a bunch of disarmed victim Christians with the military and the police cowering outside while they get shot at instead of storming in and taking those people out.
[00:43:09.588 --> 00:43:14.653]  I'll guarantee you if this was 1960 Texas, those gunmen would have been dead in minutes.
[00:43:15.831 --> 00:43:19.933]  People would have poured out of their cars, they'd have kicked those doors down before the cops ever got there.
[00:43:20.413 --> 00:43:21.374]  And Texas has proven it.
[00:43:21.614 --> 00:43:22.494]  That's what Texas does.
[00:43:22.754 --> 00:43:24.175]  Now, I'm not saying Texas has done that now.
[00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:28.417]  Texas had its huevos chopped off, you know, a long time ago and mailed into Obama.
[00:43:29.038 --> 00:43:33.200]  But, at the same time, still, Texas has fallen, but it's like Helter Skelter's song.
[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:35.021]  I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you.
[00:43:35.041 --> 00:43:39.963]  I mean, you go to California, man, it's jellyfish world.
[00:43:43.205 --> 00:43:45.326]  I'm not saying everybody in California, but you know what I'm getting at.
[00:43:47.742 --> 00:43:49.647]  Now let's shift gears into something even more important.
[00:43:50.609 --> 00:43:56.824]  Warren Buffett, artificial intelligence, we'll play this clip in a moment, will decide whether humans live or die.
[00:43:58.177 --> 00:43:59.178]  Infowars.com.
[00:44:00.679 --> 00:44:02.701]  Now, of course, when I read this article, what did I think about?
[00:44:02.761 --> 00:44:10.107]  Well, I thought about the fact that he's the co-owner of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that fences about $50 billion a year of profits through it so it's tax-free.
[00:44:10.868 --> 00:44:18.915]  I thought about the fact that he's a sickening evil person whose Wells Fargo and Wachovia banks have been caught laundering hundreds of billions of dollars in drug money and he got in no trouble.
[00:44:19.295 --> 00:44:25.579]  I think about what an organized gangster crime lord he is, and now he's the biggest recipient of the last three banker bailouts.
[00:44:26.059 --> 00:44:28.340]  Just look it up, it's McClatchy Newspaper, AP Reuters.
[00:44:28.781 --> 00:44:31.162]  Just the headline, Warren Buffett, biggest recipient of bailout.
[00:44:31.862 --> 00:44:32.223]  Himself.
[00:44:33.684 --> 00:44:39.007]  But he gets up on ABC News this week, almost every week, they have pieces going, we need to raise taxes on the rich.
[00:44:39.167 --> 00:44:40.408]  I don't pay taxes, that's wrong.
[00:44:40.848 --> 00:44:42.489]  I'm Warren Buffett, I want to give you my money.
[00:44:42.969 --> 00:44:45.891]  My secretary makes more than I. He doesn't tell you he helped write the laws.
[00:44:47.847 --> 00:44:51.689]  Help write the laws to exempt the billionaires and people like him.
[00:44:51.709 --> 00:44:54.491]  See, the regulators don't come after him when he doesn't pay taxes.
[00:44:54.511 --> 00:44:55.731]  He's allowed to take tax breaks.
[00:44:56.972 --> 00:44:58.653]  You're making $200,000, $300,000 a year.
[00:44:59.033 --> 00:45:00.794]  You try to take tax breaks that are on the books.
[00:45:01.115 --> 00:45:03.736]  No CPA will give them to you because they've been held liable.
[00:45:04.076 --> 00:45:06.978]  You have to go to a tax lawyer and then have them certify it.
[00:45:07.238 --> 00:45:08.659]  And then the IRS still comes after you.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:10.841]  Let's say they make a million dollars a year.
[00:45:11.121 --> 00:45:12.462]  You got a hundred employees.
[00:45:13.462 --> 00:45:17.724]  Over the years, you want to put away a couple hundred thousand dollars a year, offshore, if you don't trust this government?
[00:45:17.964 --> 00:45:19.565]  They call that illegal, even though it's not.
[00:45:22.407 --> 00:45:24.188]  So, so, so, see, I see an article about Warren Buffett.
[00:45:24.508 --> 00:45:31.131]  I think about him shutting down the Keystone Pipeline so he can transship it with George Soros to China, via railways he owns in Canada.
[00:45:31.411 --> 00:45:33.272]  I think about all his sabotage, all he's done.
[00:45:33.552 --> 00:45:36.474]  And then he's like, everything's going to be fair under Obamacare.
[00:45:37.748 --> 00:45:44.751]  Because computers, that are already commanding the doctors, will tell you everything to do, and it'll decide whether you live or die.
[00:45:45.172 --> 00:45:46.692]  Well, who programs the computers?
[00:45:46.712 --> 00:45:46.912]  See?
[00:45:47.233 --> 00:45:49.374]  That's the whole zeitgeist movement that the New York Times promotes.
[00:45:49.794 --> 00:45:54.876]  A computer will decide where you work, where you live, and what you do, and we'll all live in big communal buildings.
[00:45:55.316 --> 00:45:56.557]  That sounds like prison, doesn't it?
[00:45:56.697 --> 00:46:04.521]  It is, but see, if you say it with long hair, you talk real soft and condescending and lisping and fake intellectual,
[00:46:05.928 --> 00:46:11.512]  And then, Alex, if you don't agree, you'll be sent to a re-education camp.
[00:46:12.572 --> 00:46:19.117]  And then later, the guy, Peter Joseph, comes back and says, I'll come on your show if you apologize for saying I said you'd be re-educated.
[00:46:19.817 --> 00:46:22.759]  And I went back and watched the interview, and he said, you'll be sent for re-education.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.781]  And he went on the phone, he goes, I never said that.
[00:46:26.202 --> 00:46:27.322]  We know the truth.
[00:46:28.423 --> 00:46:29.023]  Yes.
[00:46:29.444 --> 00:46:31.585]  Two plus two equals whatever you say?
[00:46:31.605 --> 00:46:35.288]  Because you talk with a condescending voice?
[00:46:36.325 --> 00:46:37.066]  Come here.
[00:46:37.806 --> 00:46:39.147]  Like Count Dracula at Avant Helsing.
[00:46:39.367 --> 00:46:40.208]  Come here.
[00:46:41.389 --> 00:46:42.569]  I did not say that.
[00:46:42.649 --> 00:46:43.930]  Come here.
[00:46:44.811 --> 00:46:47.893]  You have a strong will for one who's only lived one life.
[00:46:48.153 --> 00:46:50.575]  I mean, you think that stuff really works on me?
[00:46:50.975 --> 00:46:51.876]  Like your job at the hut?
[00:46:52.156 --> 00:46:52.937]  Ho, ho, ho.
[00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:54.278]  Teeny Jedi.
[00:46:54.698 --> 00:46:55.198]  Think so?
[00:46:55.719 --> 00:46:56.920]  You think all your games work on me?
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:58.481]  It doesn't work on me!
[00:46:59.341 --> 00:47:01.363]  And once the human spirit ignites, it doesn't work on anybody.
[00:47:02.233 --> 00:47:04.554]  I'm not here doing anything but opening the blinds to wake people up.
[00:47:05.154 --> 00:47:05.994]  You don't like the light, do you?
[00:47:06.334 --> 00:47:07.554]  Pull those blinds up.
[00:47:07.634 --> 00:47:08.435]  I like sun.
[00:47:09.155 --> 00:47:09.795]  I love it.
[00:47:10.175 --> 00:47:14.396]  And red-blooded humans, I don't care what color they are, will never be your slaves.
[00:47:15.537 --> 00:47:17.837]  Now, the explosion when I read this article.
[00:47:17.857 --> 00:47:18.517]  This is how my brain works.
[00:47:18.537 --> 00:47:18.757]  You get it.
[00:47:18.917 --> 00:47:19.818]  I have hundreds of articles.
[00:47:20.118 --> 00:47:20.918]  Only cover two or three.
[00:47:20.978 --> 00:47:22.578]  Not because I don't have more news.
[00:47:22.618 --> 00:47:24.559]  I've got hundreds, hundreds of articles.
[00:47:24.839 --> 00:47:25.739]  Tons of video clips.
[00:47:25.779 --> 00:47:26.479]  Special reports.
[00:47:26.659 --> 00:47:28.380]  But I'm just showing you how the world really works here.
[00:47:30.854 --> 00:47:36.176]  I read this article, my brain explodes, I watch the clip, and then what's the little creme de la creme?
[00:47:36.196 --> 00:47:37.856]  What do I instantly think in the explosion?
[00:47:38.996 --> 00:47:51.680]  Two weeks ago, Joe Begg's report that was hidden in plain view in the Associated Press, going, don't worry, it's no big deal that they have no treat list for hundreds of thousands of veterans for operable things, and they just let them die.
[00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:58.922]  It's okay, there was no bad intent, a human didn't decide, it's an IBM computer named Watson!
[00:48:01.924 --> 00:48:02.125]  See?
[00:48:02.465 --> 00:48:05.128]  They just announced, like, don't worry, we have giant death camps.
[00:48:05.308 --> 00:48:06.229]  We call them VAs.
[00:48:06.409 --> 00:48:06.830]  Literally.
[00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:13.032]  But don't worry, it wasn't people on the bioethics boards because they won't sign off on it.
[00:48:13.552 --> 00:48:17.694]  They just get orders from a central computer called Watson made by IBM.
[00:48:18.054 --> 00:48:27.097]  Do you know what they called one of the main versions of the Hollerith IBM Thomas Watson owned computer that was first designed for race mixing studies?
[00:48:27.777 --> 00:48:29.258]  There's New York Times bestselling books on it.
[00:48:29.918 --> 00:48:31.379]  It was called the Watson.
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:34.220]  The actual
[00:48:37.674 --> 00:48:47.047]  Progeny of the death camp, slave camp, forced labor camp computers that people had tattoos on their arms to be entered into decides who to kill.
[00:48:47.067 --> 00:48:50.292]  And I told you the VA is the model for Obamacare?
[00:48:52.319 --> 00:48:55.821]  And we got Bill Gates going out and going, we do have death panels.
[00:48:56.421 --> 00:48:57.762]  Get rid of one teacher or higher.
[00:48:57.782 --> 00:49:00.383]  I mean, get one old lady and hire ten teachers.
[00:49:00.603 --> 00:49:04.025]  Everyone's being taught, people die, then you get resources.
[00:49:04.085 --> 00:49:07.507]  Not build civilizations of the stars, then we empower humanity.
[00:49:07.567 --> 00:49:07.727]  No.
[00:49:08.187 --> 00:49:09.448]  We have predatory economy.
[00:49:09.488 --> 00:49:10.448]  We feed on humans.
[00:49:10.868 --> 00:49:11.709]  We dumb them down.
[00:49:11.749 --> 00:49:12.609]  We control them.
[00:49:12.749 --> 00:49:16.091]  Then some of you that go along with us, you might get to survive.
[00:49:18.038 --> 00:49:22.200]  Everyone sits there in the audience going, ugh, kill, kill, kill, then I get hired.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.780]  Talking to college students who want jobs, can't get them.
[00:49:25.321 --> 00:49:26.361]  You know how you get money?
[00:49:26.401 --> 00:49:28.522]  You kill your parents, Bill Gates basically said.
[00:49:30.563 --> 00:49:35.064]  While they roll out, I've got a stack of news about their social engineering today.
[00:49:35.084 --> 00:49:45.068]  His father, black op intelligence in the army, the former head of Planned Parenthood, shutting up a front company for IBM.
[00:49:46.121 --> 00:49:46.501]  Look it up.
[00:49:46.641 --> 00:49:48.963]  It's very deep intel, but the pieces are all there.
[00:49:49.663 --> 00:49:57.148]  Microsoft is an antitrust break-off of an old strategy to get around antitrust laws that were being partially enforced in the 60s and 70s.
[00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:02.592]  It is a wholly owned, it's basically the Nazi submerged government.
[00:50:03.052 --> 00:50:03.573]  It's Hydra.
[00:50:04.959 --> 00:50:09.221]  And that's more, that's what intelligence called the underground Nazi movement was Hydra.
[00:50:09.821 --> 00:50:12.602]  That isn't in Captain America, that's Captain America imitating reality.
[00:50:13.263 --> 00:50:15.564]  And again, Hydra, one head was the Nazis.
[00:50:15.884 --> 00:50:17.745]  Hydra's body is not Nazi.
[00:50:18.285 --> 00:50:20.266]  Hydra's body is in London.
[00:50:20.946 --> 00:50:22.527]  Hydra's body is in D.C.
[00:50:23.267 --> 00:50:26.428]  Hydra's body is in the Dutch Royal Family.
[00:50:26.928 --> 00:50:29.049]  Hydra's body is in the Rothschild Palace.
[00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:31.170]  That's the organs of Hydra.
[00:50:32.211 --> 00:50:32.911]  Hail Hydra!
[00:50:36.638 --> 00:50:41.753]  And now the Watson machine is busting caps in our veterans.
[00:50:42.314 --> 00:50:43.217]  Is that the number one threat?
[00:50:44.264 --> 00:50:46.245]  The computers there dealing out the death all day?
[00:50:46.925 --> 00:50:48.406]  They just deny them care and ship them out.
[00:50:48.426 --> 00:50:49.826]  We've got to take care of the troops ourselves.
[00:50:50.167 --> 00:50:52.087]  We've got to take them in, we've got to give them jobs, we've got to love them.
[00:50:52.247 --> 00:50:53.828]  And we've got to tell them you're not mentally ill.
[00:50:54.128 --> 00:50:55.869]  It doesn't matter if you're part of an evil operation.
[00:50:56.149 --> 00:50:58.130]  We're going to raise you up to fight for the Republic now.
[00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:00.551]  And we're going to defeat the globals with a human spirit.
[00:51:00.931 --> 00:51:01.872]  Nothing can stop it!
[00:51:02.212 --> 00:51:03.292]  Release the human spirit!
[00:51:03.512 --> 00:51:04.693]  Pray to Christ now!
[00:51:05.133 --> 00:51:07.234]  Let the spirit be risen against the enemy!

[00:51:40.863 --> 00:51:44.085]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[00:51:44.485 --> 00:51:47.667]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[00:51:47.907 --> 00:51:51.569]  378, will take away your right to buy level 3 and higher body armor.

[00:52:08.962 --> 00:52:11.544]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:11.804 --> 00:52:16.666]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:16.927 --> 00:52:24.811]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:25.051 --> 00:52:29.354]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:29.574 --> 00:52:33.376]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:33.536 --> 00:52:39.240]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:42.262]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:42.662 --> 00:52:47.866]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:48.026 --> 00:52:56.151]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:26.072]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving.
[00:54:27.553 --> 00:54:29.954]  I won't even turn my head.
[00:54:32.436 --> 00:54:36.318]  Don't send your kin folks to give me no talking.
[00:54:38.079 --> 00:54:40.140]  I'll be gone like I said.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.921]  That's what I'm saying to Obama and the globalists.
[00:54:43.236 --> 00:54:45.057]  Lay there in your parasite bed.
[00:54:45.077 --> 00:54:46.277]  Keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[00:54:46.317 --> 00:54:47.877]  You're a racist, do what I say.
[00:54:47.937 --> 00:54:49.398]  I'm tired of your bad mouthing.
[00:54:49.518 --> 00:54:49.838]  Understand.
[00:55:14.693 --> 00:55:15.533]  Best parts right here.
[00:55:18.134 --> 00:55:19.015]  Old Johnny Cash.
[00:55:20.415 --> 00:55:21.015]  Bringing us in.
[00:55:23.516 --> 00:55:24.457]  Old Warren Buffett.
[00:55:25.197 --> 00:55:26.137]  Nice old man.
[00:55:27.378 --> 00:55:28.738]  Likes to give the kids candy.
[00:55:30.059 --> 00:55:32.280]  He wouldn't harm a fly, would he?
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.420]  That little sweetheart.
[00:55:34.341 --> 00:55:35.381]  That little kingpin.
[00:55:36.962 --> 00:55:39.522]  Artificial intelligence will decide whether humans live or die.
[00:55:41.783 --> 00:55:43.204]  And notice he talks to the children.
[00:55:44.861 --> 00:55:45.581]  Like their children.
[00:55:46.502 --> 00:55:49.063]  He says, it will be the computer that makes the decision.
[00:55:49.444 --> 00:55:53.306]  In a nanosecond, who lives or who dies, because it's already been going on.
[00:55:53.986 --> 00:56:03.512]  And now under centralization, everything basically goes through the central system and more and more of the decisions are made by the computers.
[00:56:07.754 --> 00:56:10.336]  And he's just a nice old man at the auto show.
[00:56:11.556 --> 00:56:15.060]  Friendly guy there talking to you, helping out.
[00:56:16.161 --> 00:56:18.063]  Oh, he's so sweet.
[00:56:18.563 --> 00:56:19.684]  Ever heard of camouflage?
[00:56:20.545 --> 00:56:29.114]  DART was coming out with a new drone sub that can sit on the ocean floor for years and then blast off, take off, and then comes an aircraft loaded with cruise missiles.
[00:56:32.056 --> 00:56:34.319]  And it's nice old men like him that run it.
[00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:38.051]  If we get rid of grandma, we can hire 10 teachers.
[00:56:38.712 --> 00:56:47.396]  Don't worry, with the bioethics boards, you won't have to kill people, the computer will decide, which is programmed by our friends.
[00:56:49.277 --> 00:56:50.237]  Our friends.
[00:56:51.938 --> 00:56:59.602]  And when I said take the troops in, the globals like to lead the movements claiming they're for the troops, so they can control and skim off the money and the rest of it.
[00:56:59.822 --> 00:57:00.823]  There's some good groups out there.
[00:57:01.553 --> 00:57:07.157]  You don't see these big veteran groups standing up against troops being named as terrorists by the government, or the number one threat, or on death panels.
[00:57:09.239 --> 00:57:09.399]  No.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.482]  They just give us money and we'll take care of wounded troops.
[00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:15.464]  Because yeah, the VA won't do it, but it's gotta go further.
[00:57:15.644 --> 00:57:17.426]  You gotta organize to fix it.
[00:57:18.086 --> 00:57:18.887]  See, that won't happen.
[00:57:20.368 --> 00:57:22.530]  Don't ever ask why breast cancer's up 3,000%.
[00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:23.711]  Just try to find a cure.
[00:57:24.071 --> 00:57:25.192]  Find out why it's happening.
[00:57:27.363 --> 00:57:30.734]  If everybody's dying in the town from poison in the water, don't try to find a cure to the poison.
[00:57:30.935 --> 00:57:31.737]  Get the poison out!
[00:57:32.881 --> 00:57:34.005]  Let's go to Warren Buffett's clip.
[00:57:34.025 --> 00:57:34.326]  Here it is.
[00:57:35.745 --> 00:57:36.805]  There's some interesting questions.
[00:57:36.885 --> 00:57:52.008]  I mean, let's just say you've got a self-driving car, and you're going down the street, and a three-year-old kid runs out in front of the car, and there's another car coming the other direction with four people in it, and the computer's going to make the decision as to whether to hit the kid or hit the other car.
[00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:55.709]  You know, I'm not sure who gets sued under those circumstances.
[00:57:55.729 --> 00:57:56.889]  You're going to kill somebody.
[00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:02.391]  And it will be the computer that makes the decision in a nanosecond.
[00:58:05.034 --> 00:58:10.916]  It'll be interesting to know who programs that computer and what their thoughts are about the values of human lives and things.
[00:58:11.016 --> 00:58:12.497]  All right, let's stop right there.
[00:58:13.037 --> 00:58:17.259]  See, and I see an article like this and I think about the machines they're using to already do it.
[00:58:17.539 --> 00:58:30.104]  So I want Paul Watson to add to this an Alex Jones comment about the Bill Gates clip about death panels and then our articles and others about the death panels for the troops so people see in context the machines are already making those decisions.
[00:58:30.484 --> 00:58:34.706]  And if Joe Biggs wants to do a report for The Nightly News tonight on this, the follow-up on his previous report, that'd be important.
[00:58:35.936 --> 00:58:36.496]  So there you go.
[00:58:36.817 --> 00:58:37.217]  The headline.
[00:58:37.237 --> 00:58:39.298]  Computers already deciding who lives and dies.
[00:58:39.878 --> 00:58:41.059]  And then who programs the computers.
[00:58:41.419 --> 00:58:42.420]  And then explain the big picture.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:45.401]  By the way, free shipping on everything at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:00:21.982 --> 01:00:22.883]  Well, so does he.

[01:00:27.705 --> 01:00:31.766]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:40.589 --> 01:00:44.331]  Well, we've got a Sunni-Shia civil war that Lovell has planned all along.
[01:00:44.371 --> 01:00:47.994]  We predicted five years ago, breaking out everywhere in the Middle East.
[01:00:50.815 --> 01:00:53.017]  That's just some of the news we're going to be breaking down.
[01:00:53.037 --> 01:01:03.143]  We have Joel Skousen of World Affairs Briefs to join us to cover the economy, the Russia situation, where he sees all of these issues going.
[01:01:04.063 --> 01:01:06.245]  Iran talks have fallen short, developing.
[01:01:06.685 --> 01:01:08.186]  Boehner says the world's on fire.
[01:01:08.546 --> 01:01:09.907]  Pope warns priests against
[01:01:11.206 --> 01:01:20.112]  Weariness of people, blood moon with total lunar eclipse, to rise over Easter weekend, just moon after moon, eclipse after eclipse, unprecedented.
[01:01:20.732 --> 01:01:24.174]  Cryptical, biblical message, we have to report on that.
[01:01:24.635 --> 01:01:32.960]  Rebels capture presidential palace in Yemen, Al-Qaeda storms jail, free student inmates, foreign troops land in Port City, 70 students killed, now it's 70 plus.
[01:01:34.403 --> 01:01:35.744]  See how that changed since this morning?
[01:01:35.784 --> 01:01:36.744]  CNN's whitewash?
[01:01:37.185 --> 01:01:38.225]  It's 70-plus.
[01:01:38.285 --> 01:01:39.746]  Guys, print me that Sky News article.
[01:01:40.366 --> 01:01:41.287]  I'm reading these off Drudge.
[01:01:41.327 --> 01:01:43.008]  They're also on InfoWars.com.
[01:01:44.008 --> 01:01:47.350]  And we really need... I sent my messages at like 7 a.m.
[01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:56.976]  to three of the writers, and I said, will somebody do an article paralleling that the Interpol chief called for arming schools and malls so this doesn't happen?
[01:01:57.676 --> 01:01:58.917]  The answer is arming citizens.
[01:01:59.257 --> 01:02:00.558]  That needs to be out there.
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:02.640]  That needs to be discussed.
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:04.041]  70 dead.
[01:02:04.181 --> 01:02:05.861]  See, I was going off CNN 15.
[01:02:06.141 --> 01:02:06.781]  Now it's 70.
[01:02:06.881 --> 01:02:09.602]  Lord knows what it's going to be.
[01:02:10.602 --> 01:02:11.663]  Please print me that article.
[01:02:11.783 --> 01:02:12.863]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:02:16.964 --> 01:02:17.704]  Look at this headline.
[01:02:18.064 --> 01:02:20.365]  IBM's Watson enters the running for Prime Minister.
[01:02:21.925 --> 01:02:29.467]  In a move that was sure to shake up political status quo of the country, IBM has announced that its artificial intelligence computer system Watson will run for Prime Minister during UK's general election.
[01:02:32.594 --> 01:02:33.415]  As if you could do that.
[01:02:33.795 --> 01:02:37.640]  Says the company announced that the computer would also just do a job as two leading candidates.
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:40.102]  So they're already introducing the idea that computers will do a better job.
[01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:42.805]  And I guess IBM programs those, so they'll take over for us.
[01:02:43.286 --> 01:02:45.829]  IBM hopes Watson will lead the way in Silicon Valley.
[01:02:49.687 --> 01:02:51.809]  Could IBM's Watson decide the next U.S.
[01:02:51.849 --> 01:02:52.229]  election?
[01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:54.991]  Yeah, the article I want on Watson, guys, is we did one.
[01:02:55.511 --> 01:03:01.455]  Biggs did a report about a month ago, and it was in the news that Watson is deciding the treatments at the VA.
[01:03:01.536 --> 01:03:02.536]  That was the big issue.
[01:03:03.397 --> 01:03:03.697]  Thanks.
[01:03:05.298 --> 01:03:08.060]  Because that ties into the Warren Buffett article that I was mentioning.
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:11.663]  Artificial intelligence will decide whether humans will live or die.
[01:03:13.561 --> 01:03:15.182]  And again, who programs the computers?
[01:03:15.622 --> 01:03:17.963]  Even if they say the computer is better, who's making that claim?
[01:03:17.983 --> 01:03:23.266]  I mean, this is fundamental, huge stuff we're talking about, we're discussing here.
[01:03:26.067 --> 01:03:26.287]  U.S.
[01:03:26.307 --> 01:03:30.169]  Defense Secretary says we may bomb Iran even if a peace agreement is signed.
[01:03:30.529 --> 01:03:34.291]  Monsanto donates money to save the same butterflies that they're killing.
[01:03:35.212 --> 01:03:39.934]  Irate Democratic titans say Obama screwed up and gave rise to China's new mega-bank.
[01:03:40.474 --> 01:03:42.035]  Senator Menendez indicted, but
[01:03:43.183 --> 01:03:44.803]  The former head of the IRS not indicted.
[01:03:46.704 --> 01:03:49.485]  DARPA to test submarine drone that takes off from the ocean.
[01:03:50.685 --> 01:03:55.227]  Suit Facebook uses facial recognition technology, violates Illinois' privacy laws.
[01:03:56.647 --> 01:03:58.447]  That is just some of what's coming up.
[01:03:58.648 --> 01:04:01.608]  And France moves in the direction of banning cash.
[01:04:02.229 --> 01:04:03.289]  Well, that's already happening here.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.501]  You got the Socialist Party there that's basically tax-exempt.
[01:04:06.521 --> 01:04:07.862]  The EU is openly tax-exempt.
[01:04:08.122 --> 01:04:09.183]  They have Swiss bank accounts.
[01:04:09.643 --> 01:04:12.365]  But the general public pays 101% tax.
[01:04:12.765 --> 01:04:13.926]  You say, that sounds insane.
[01:04:14.486 --> 01:04:19.969]  Well, they quote, give some of it back as socialist services, but that's total control.
[01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:21.831]  When you, you say, well, how do you get 101?
[01:04:22.111 --> 01:04:23.732]  Well, there was some savings from before.
[01:04:24.152 --> 01:04:27.254]  So it's a clawback where you can't have anything.
[01:04:28.203 --> 01:04:30.004]  We're having 1% of your own money.
[01:04:30.504 --> 01:04:38.486]  That simple vote of controlling your 1%, deciding where you can spend, what you can do, would cause renaissance and revolutionize.
[01:04:38.506 --> 01:04:40.067]  They want stagnation and control.
[01:04:40.307 --> 01:04:41.787]  They don't want a human space program.
[01:04:42.207 --> 01:04:43.968]  They don't want human free will or decisions.
[01:04:44.228 --> 01:04:45.228]  They're anti-free will.
[01:04:45.828 --> 01:04:46.929]  That's their main system.
[01:04:47.449 --> 01:04:50.390]  Controlling, dominating, ending humanity as we know it.
[01:04:51.317 --> 01:04:52.398]  All right, Joel Scouse is coming up.
[01:04:52.418 --> 01:04:54.840]  I'm going to hit all these articles with him and a lot more.
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:58.663]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[01:04:59.084 --> 01:05:03.588]  And remember, if you're watching or receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, so spread the word.
[01:05:03.868 --> 01:05:06.190]  The enemy's working double time to try to shut us down.
[01:05:09.671 --> 01:05:11.332]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:05:11.632 --> 01:05:15.394]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:05:15.854 --> 01:05:20.177]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:05:20.317 --> 01:05:27.101]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:05:27.621 --> 01:05:33.524]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:05:33.524 --> 01:05:34.004]  We're good to go.
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.023]  Or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:06:03.043 --> 01:06:04.066]  DNA Force, from InfoWarsLife.

[01:06:43.665 --> 01:06:47.628]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[01:07:04.359 --> 01:07:06.180]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:07:09.122 --> 01:07:10.343]  Another major health threat.
[01:07:10.383 --> 01:07:15.286]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:07:15.367 --> 01:07:18.008]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:07:18.048 --> 01:07:24.813]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:07:25.073 --> 01:07:27.935]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:07:28.075 --> 01:07:31.018]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:07:31.098 --> 01:07:33.019]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:07:33.039 --> 01:07:35.901]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:07:35.981 --> 01:07:41.463]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:45.165]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:07:45.185 --> 01:07:48.186]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:07:48.286 --> 01:07:55.389]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:08:05.233 --> 01:08:07.134]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:08:12.356 --> 01:08:18.358]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:18.979 --> 01:08:21.960]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:35.965 --> 01:08:43.428]  As of a few hours ago, Western media was still refusing to call radical Islamists radical Islamists or even terrorists.
[01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:46.489]  They were saying the number was 15 dead.
[01:08:47.949 --> 01:08:53.311]  Now Sky News is reporting at least 70 dead as hostages taken at college.
[01:08:55.392 --> 01:09:02.594]  And you basically have radical jihadis, Al-Qaeda affiliated, pouring in to Kenya
[01:09:06.283 --> 01:09:08.204]  And waging war on the nation.
[01:09:09.744 --> 01:09:13.166]  When they started having infiltrators come in from the north, Kenya began fighting back.
[01:09:13.946 --> 01:09:16.267]  And now they're getting attacked on a routine basis.
[01:09:16.707 --> 01:09:24.170]  And the head of Interpol, two years ago, when they had the mall massacre there in Kenya, said armed citizens globally to prevent terror attacks.
[01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:32.813]  He told Reuters and ABC News, Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble, the UN openly wants to ban the guns in civilian hands worldwide.
[01:09:33.433 --> 01:09:38.277]  There's the ABC News headline, exclusive, after Westgate Interpol chief ponders armed citizenry.
[01:09:38.597 --> 01:09:40.199]  That's obviously the answer.
[01:09:41.339 --> 01:09:52.068]  But instead you have a total demonization of that and our own government arming Islamic State, Al Qaeda and others in creating a Sunni Shiite civil war destabilization program.
[01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:55.191]  The FBI a month ago, five weeks ago now, saying
[01:09:56.329 --> 01:10:03.131]  ISIS, which is Al Qaeda, same group, same flags, same mindset, Saudi Arabia funded, is in all 50 states.
[01:10:06.252 --> 01:10:07.953]  This is just the biggest false flag ever.
[01:10:07.973 --> 01:10:09.433]  These are real jihadis, many of them.
[01:10:09.674 --> 01:10:18.957]  Some of them are wind-up toys, provocateurs, but there are undoubtedly real groups here operating that are going to be allowed to operate, which again will be used to bring in more control.
[01:10:19.677 --> 01:10:22.538]  Not arming citizens, but disarming citizens is their answer.
[01:10:23.871 --> 01:10:26.092]  Truly unprecedented.
[01:10:27.113 --> 01:10:28.134]  Truly unprecedented.
[01:10:28.714 --> 01:10:31.856]  France, as I mentioned, is moving in the direction of banning cash.
[01:10:32.216 --> 01:10:35.898]  France will begin more closely monitoring its citizens' transactions and withdrawals of money.
[01:10:36.359 --> 01:10:52.649]  They have, according to Forbes, a 101% tax now on upper middle class to claw back and make sure no one has any savings but the ruling class that doesn't pay taxes, been caught not paying taxes, and has Swiss bank accounts, as I mentioned, and exempt themselves at the EU bureaucracy level from the tax.
[01:10:54.178 --> 01:11:08.824]  So France is the model, because again, if you've got 1 or even 5% or 10% of your own money, you'll be able to vote with your dollars, with your euros, with your pocketbook, to create new economies of free will that will become so popular, they will change society.
[01:11:08.844 --> 01:11:11.726]  That's why in a centralized society, they can have no free will.
[01:11:12.585 --> 01:11:18.266]  That's why you've got to vote with your dollars, with your euros, with your different currencies, with your purchases now.
[01:11:18.586 --> 01:11:24.788]  That's why you've got to tell neighbors and co-workers and friends and your church about InfoWars.com and this show.
[01:11:24.808 --> 01:11:35.611]  So we've got to send them the free link, InfoWars.com forward slash show, to find the free video and audio feeds and the free podcast and Droid and Apple apps.
[01:11:36.311 --> 01:11:37.051]  You have the power!
[01:11:38.171 --> 01:11:39.314]  We are gaining more stations.
[01:11:39.354 --> 01:11:40.578]  We are gaining more sponsors.
[01:11:40.618 --> 01:11:41.681]  We are doing better than we ever have.
[01:11:41.761 --> 01:11:43.225]  But, that's in a headwind.
[01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:45.176]  That's with the system.
[01:11:45.216 --> 01:11:47.939]  We're like salmon going upstream by sheer will.
[01:11:48.279 --> 01:11:50.581]  They are turning up the heat in the attacks.
[01:11:50.962 --> 01:11:53.464]  They are going after our show on stations.
[01:11:53.825 --> 01:11:58.689]  They're offering to buy during the week our time all across the country to get us off.
[01:11:59.150 --> 01:12:02.093]  There is a major move to shut down InfoWars.com right now.
[01:12:02.713 --> 01:12:03.434]  And I ought to be happy.
[01:12:03.454 --> 01:12:04.895]  At least they're not killing me or setting me up.
[01:12:05.296 --> 01:12:06.437]  Though I'm sure that's in the cards.
[01:12:06.797 --> 01:12:07.979]  So please understand.
[01:12:08.928 --> 01:12:19.534]  Obama, I forgot this, in fact, I couldn't find it in the stack, signed an executive order saying what they're going to do with the new FCC power grab with this head guy, tax it, regulate it, totally take it over.
[01:12:19.554 --> 01:12:21.415]  I mean, I forgot that executive order.
[01:12:21.455 --> 01:12:22.215]  Please give me that, guys.
[01:12:23.016 --> 01:12:25.077]  It's all moving in high gear right now.
[01:12:26.277 --> 01:12:28.178]  It's accelerating right now.
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:38.124]  And you've got major preparations for war, you've got Russian strategists that advise Putin calling for
[01:12:39.332 --> 01:12:48.556]  Nukes to be smuggled into the U.S., to be detonated on the San Andreas fault line, and on the big area there in Yellowstone to trigger the caldera.
[01:12:48.596 --> 01:12:52.237]  I'm not saying that's going to happen, but the point is the rhetoric is escalating.
[01:12:52.257 --> 01:12:52.537]  There it is.
[01:12:53.057 --> 01:12:53.497]  CNN.
[01:12:53.617 --> 01:12:57.079]  Obama announces executive order on sanctions against hackers.
[01:12:57.776 --> 01:13:02.237]  And then you actually read it, it's executive order where they claim downloading something's hacking.
[01:13:02.537 --> 01:13:04.218]  Just huge power grabs happening.
[01:13:04.558 --> 01:13:09.860]  We have an article on InfoWars, though, that deciphers it from EFF, the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:14.501]  New executive order, Obama takes total control of the internet, declares national cybersecurity emergency.
[01:13:14.881 --> 01:13:17.202]  We're going to discuss all of this today.
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:20.801]  Now I wanted to get Joel Scowls on last week, but he was busy.
[01:13:20.861 --> 01:13:34.250]  He joins us now to get into all of this, but the first thing I want to cover with him is these military drills, which we never said that Jade Helm and others were the takeover from day one.
[01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:45.697]  We said it's conditioning, it's militarization, it's all in our incorporation plan from the 80s, repackaged in the 90s, and again last year, called the National Stability Force, or National Police Stability Force.
[01:13:46.057 --> 01:13:47.338]  The Pentagon's called for it.
[01:13:47.838 --> 01:13:48.538]  It's happening.
[01:13:48.698 --> 01:13:50.739]  It's NORTHCOM with SOUTHCOM.
[01:13:51.399 --> 01:13:55.180]  They mentioned Texas and Utah as hostile and Orange County.
[01:13:56.291 --> 01:13:58.874]  That's subliminal, folks, basically, in plain view.
[01:13:59.515 --> 01:14:11.828]  Because sure, there's a lot of legitimate training going on within it, but Nested is the main program of gun owners, veterans, Christians, Mormons, anybody who doesn't want to be domesticated, anyone that
[01:14:12.569 --> 01:14:18.193]  Wants to be self-sufficient is the enemy, because again, if you're self-sufficient, you're not under their control.
[01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:19.294]  It's elementary.
[01:14:19.835 --> 01:14:21.856]  So I don't know Joel Skousen's take on this.
[01:14:21.936 --> 01:14:28.982]  Editor of WorldAffairsBrief.com, and of course the author of several best-selling, the best-selling book, The Secure Home.
[01:14:29.782 --> 01:14:32.906]  Uh, and of course, uh, he also wrote Strategic Relocation and made a film with me.
[01:14:33.187 --> 01:14:37.432]  Both the book and the film I produced are available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:14:37.472 --> 01:14:40.756]  You're insane if you haven't watched the video and read the book.
[01:14:41.137 --> 01:14:47.826]  It really is the best intel out there, uh, from Joel Skousen, uh, Marine Corps fighter pilot aviator in the Vietnam era.
[01:14:48.526 --> 01:14:51.209]  And of course, the nephew of Cleon Skousen, who wrote The Naked Communist.
[01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:55.113]  And of course, he's headed up some of the largest conservative organizations in the United States.
[01:14:55.413 --> 01:14:57.516]  Joel, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:14:57.896 --> 01:15:03.341]  I threw out a lot of information in the last five minutes, but are you happy to tackle Jade Helm first?
[01:15:04.352 --> 01:15:05.992]  Yes, let's go with that, Alex.
[01:15:06.712 --> 01:15:18.935]  My major concern about the internet hype is what you started out in saying that you did not say, and I think that's important, that this is not the implementation of martial law.
[01:15:18.975 --> 01:15:27.357]  It takes a very big excuse to imitate or to initiate martial law, and there's nothing that they could throw at the U.S.
[01:15:27.397 --> 01:15:30.517]  that they wouldn't get blamed for unless we get to a war scenario.
[01:15:30.637 --> 01:15:32.598]  But clearly, as you pointed out, this is
[01:15:33.798 --> 01:15:45.329]  A major escalation of the exercises, the domestic terrorism exercises, and you won't be able to prove that directly unless you saw some of the scenarios.
[01:15:45.689 --> 01:15:50.013]  But we know from the Fort Lauderdale exercise, for example, where they were rounding up people.
[01:15:51.115 --> 01:15:52.936]  And practicing putting him into prison.
[01:15:54.036 --> 01:15:57.438]  That this is part of a taking up dissidents.
[01:15:57.998 --> 01:15:58.898]  It's not imminent.
[01:15:59.479 --> 01:16:13.404]  It's a long crescendo growth of training and conditioning military people to do this without question, just like the Marine Corps survey asking or testing Marines to see who would be willing to confiscate American weapons.
[01:16:13.424 --> 01:16:17.086]  That's very, very disturbing that there is the intent to do that.
[01:16:17.666 --> 01:16:24.272]  Obviously there are thinkers, globalists at the national level in the various armed services that are projecting these scenarios.
[01:16:24.732 --> 01:16:31.237]  They're not going to tell the military directly a lot of things because they know that there's a lot of objections in the military.
[01:16:31.257 --> 01:16:39.184]  But we have seen the papers at the Army War College by colonels and generals in the last few years saying our main enemy will be the Tea Party, mimicking Justice Department statements.
[01:16:39.844 --> 01:16:40.385]  Absolutely.
[01:16:40.525 --> 01:16:41.906]  No, there's no question about that.
[01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:46.710]  What's different about Jade Helm is, first of all, the scope of it.
[01:16:47.010 --> 01:17:03.203]  This is a nationwide exercise which differs significantly, you know, as a former military pilot and someone who's taken part in a lot of exercises, I can tell you that everything we did in the 80s and the 90s and, you know, 2000, this was locally based.
[01:17:03.763 --> 01:17:06.646]  There was no flying clear across the country with
[01:17:08.487 --> 01:17:11.029]  You know, prisoners that you take in and practiced incarceration.
[01:17:11.089 --> 01:17:12.530]  That's a huge waste of resources.
[01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:14.511]  Doesn't it escalate the price of the operation?
[01:17:15.091 --> 01:17:16.032]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:17:16.232 --> 01:17:23.497]  I mean, these things are, you know, nearly half a billion dollars just to even start talking about this kind of an exercise.
[01:17:23.937 --> 01:17:36.005]  But the second part that's more worrisome is the covert nature of this, that you're going to have people claiming to be blending in with citizens and then putting out the hype.
[01:17:36.025 --> 01:17:37.927]  You know, if you see anything suspicious, tell us.
[01:17:39.328 --> 01:17:45.831]  Let me tell you, you can't practice blending in for a foreign scenario by using the United States.
[01:17:45.871 --> 01:17:46.372]  Exactly!
[01:17:47.452 --> 01:17:49.453]  The techniques are absolutely different.
[01:17:49.854 --> 01:18:02.841]  Yes, it's easy to blend in if you're Americans blending in with Americans, but you try that in Latin America, you try that in Kazakhstan or, you know, the Middle East, and you can't use American soldiers to blend in.
[01:18:02.941 --> 01:18:07.644]  So this is clearly, without telling perhaps the participants,
[01:18:08.044 --> 01:18:21.557]  That you're practicing for blending in in a covert way and spying on and extracting, they use that word practice extracting, that means kidnapping basically, taking people and then flying them off to a unknown prison.
[01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:24.640]  This is, you know, Jade Helm is really
[01:18:26.616 --> 01:18:36.339]  Meshing together all of the preparations for FEMA camps, and actually there's more FEMA prisons being built on former military bases than there are actual camps.
[01:18:37.799 --> 01:18:38.619]  Well, they admit that.
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:44.921]  As you know, they've escalated the hiring for internment specials, how to process Americans, the social security numbers.
[01:18:45.581 --> 01:18:46.141]  It's all there.
[01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:48.222]  But, I mean, I remember back when they tried this with Clinton.
[01:18:48.682 --> 01:18:55.024]  They're also having the military go in and create relationships with the local police to create
[01:18:55.885 --> 01:19:03.616]  The preparation down the road to find out who's going along with it and who isn't when the Delta Force tried to bribe the San Antonio Police Chief.
[01:19:05.134 --> 01:19:23.212]  And that's why we had leaks from New Mexico, for example, telling us that they were monitoring right-wing radio stations, your broadcast, taking names of people who comment on these blogs or who respond on the radio to call-in television radio shows.
[01:19:23.572 --> 01:19:24.433]  This is very serious.
[01:19:24.473 --> 01:19:25.314]  When local police
[01:19:26.574 --> 01:19:33.619]  are joining with the federal services in monitoring American people, especially targeting American dissidents.
[01:19:33.819 --> 01:19:44.285]  People like you and I and others who object to spying on Americans as well as the preparations for martial law eventually and the militarization of police.
[01:19:44.385 --> 01:19:47.246]  But I repeat, I don't think martial law is imminent.
[01:19:47.266 --> 01:19:47.887]  I agree.
[01:19:48.507 --> 01:19:49.447]  Or anywhere close.
[01:19:50.068 --> 01:19:53.208]  I think this is a long preparatory process.
[01:19:53.228 --> 01:19:56.049]  They're running into a lot of objections with military people.
[01:19:56.469 --> 01:19:58.190]  That's why they're using a lot of mercenaries now.
[01:19:59.270 --> 01:20:06.212]  And I think part of these exercises try to weed out or vet who in the military objects to some of these scenarios.
[01:20:06.532 --> 01:20:07.493]  Precisely.
[01:20:07.993 --> 01:20:17.856]  They get on lists themselves so that when it comes time to putting forth your baddest, most unprincipled mercenaries, they won't be among them.
[01:20:18.836 --> 01:20:19.317]  That's right.
[01:20:19.417 --> 01:20:22.399]  And then they should, and those guys overseas should apply for deployment.
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:24.521]  They get put on the no treat VA list.
[01:20:25.202 --> 01:20:26.643]  They get put on the extremist list.
[01:20:26.703 --> 01:20:34.130]  And the government knows that the vast majority of the veterans who actually fought and swore an oath to the Bill of Rights and Constitution will say no to this takeover.
[01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:37.412]  And so that's why they're listed in all the Justice Department documents that are public.
[01:20:37.793 --> 01:20:38.413]  Some were secret.
[01:20:38.433 --> 01:20:38.874]  We broke it.
[01:20:39.554 --> 01:20:40.475]  That they're the enemy.
[01:20:40.555 --> 01:20:44.417]  I mean, this tells you how alien and un-American and corrupt this is.
[01:20:44.457 --> 01:20:45.457]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:20:45.917 --> 01:20:54.842]  In drill after drill, not just this one, Texas, Utah, and other areas are listed as hostile.
[01:20:55.583 --> 01:20:57.224]  I don't think that there was a mistake there.
[01:20:57.244 --> 01:21:00.325]  I think they're testing the military as well to see if they get it.
[01:21:00.625 --> 01:21:01.706]  What do you think that was about?
[01:21:05.185 --> 01:21:08.948]  You know, I was surprised they didn't include Idaho as one of those states.
[01:21:09.248 --> 01:21:14.011]  There's probably just as many, if not more, dissidents from our movement in Idaho.
[01:21:15.192 --> 01:21:20.615]  Utah's kind of interesting because right now the Mormon base there is basically
[01:21:22.423 --> 01:21:29.887]  At least the leadership of the church there is kind of placating the government, going along with government, making sure that you don't say anything negative about government.
[01:21:30.248 --> 01:21:37.332]  That said, there's a tremendous amount of Mormons who are constitutional conservatives that are the dissidents.
[01:21:37.372 --> 01:21:40.233]  So, it probably isn't the state like Idaho.
[01:21:40.634 --> 01:21:44.676]  You know, Utah and Idaho, in my book Strategic Relocation, are the two top rated states.
[01:21:44.716 --> 01:21:46.197]  They are the most conservative states.
[01:21:46.237 --> 01:21:47.178]  They have a great deal of
[01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:49.771]  And I was about to add.
[01:22:12.245 --> 01:22:34.404]  I know for a fact that the new governor of Texas has met with some top people and is aware of the conspiracy and you know they're NSA wiretapping the leadership in Utah and know that the whole cosmology recognizes a globalist takeover a hundred plus years ago so I think that's why the system doesn't like it from the get-go is because it fundamentally doesn't recognize the globalist takeover.
[01:22:35.253 --> 01:22:35.713]  That's right.
[01:22:35.854 --> 01:22:39.176]  And there is inherent resistance in those two states especially.
[01:22:39.196 --> 01:22:40.577]  It's unlike Indiana.
[01:22:40.738 --> 01:22:48.744]  I never saw a state fold so fast to tremendous, the wave of pressure against their religious freedom law.
[01:22:49.005 --> 01:22:57.332]  And, you know, and they've turned around, tail between their legs and passing an anti-discrimination which is a violation of people's fundamental rights.
[01:22:57.972 --> 01:23:10.283]  If you don't have the right to choose with whom you will associate, even on your property and your business property, then you've lost a tremendous fundamental right, and not a single person, Alex, came forward to defend the principle of discrimination.
[01:23:10.804 --> 01:23:17.030]  We have a gutless people, especially conservatives, who really don't understand what they need to be defending.
[01:23:17.050 --> 01:23:23.375]  Sure, because, I mean, if you discriminate against somebody on the basis of, say, they're a felon,
[01:23:24.495 --> 01:23:27.838]  Or you discriminate against a restaurant because the food is rotten.
[01:23:27.858 --> 01:23:33.622]  I mean, they're taking that word to the trillionth degree, where you have no free will.
[01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:38.766]  If you have no discrimination powers, then you have no direction.
[01:23:39.326 --> 01:23:50.034]  I mean, again, they manipulate words to just incredible degrees, where people basically... I mean, it's like saying, you don't like a dead dog in the street because it stinks.
[01:23:50.294 --> 01:23:52.816]  Your olfactory nerve is racist against carrion.
[01:23:54.701 --> 01:24:01.043]  Well, you know, there's a real misunderstanding among people about discrimination.
[01:24:01.083 --> 01:24:03.324]  Really, it is a fundamental right, like free speech.
[01:24:03.424 --> 01:24:10.626]  We may not like what a person uses his free speech on his own property, but he's absolutely free to say anything he wants on his own property.
[01:24:11.066 --> 01:24:13.287]  It's the same thing with your right to choice.
[01:24:14.027 --> 01:24:17.508]  They don't want us to have discriminating powers because they eventually
[01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:26.051]  ...intend to pigeonhole us into accepting things that we would not accept, such as gay relationships, which this was incredible.
[01:24:26.131 --> 01:24:36.476]  I mean, it wasn't just a few years ago when it was barely uttered that we have to tolerate gays, and now it is protecting and defending gays almost as if they have super rights.
[01:24:37.496 --> 01:24:39.097]  And promoting it to five-year-olds.
[01:24:39.657 --> 01:24:48.722]  Without discussing any of the health issues with the gay lifestyle, which are horrendous for them, and which are contagious, and the problems involved.
[01:24:48.742 --> 01:24:50.023]  There's a tremendous protection.
[01:24:50.503 --> 01:24:59.208]  But as a legal matter, it's essential to understand that anti-discrimination laws are what I call an unlimited extension of lawmaking power.
[01:24:59.488 --> 01:25:06.352]  In other words, once you allow government to enter in to what they will determine you can use to discriminate and what you can't,
[01:25:07.173 --> 01:25:08.193]  It's literally unlimited.
[01:25:08.273 --> 01:25:09.854]  They can keep adding to the choices.
[01:25:09.874 --> 01:25:14.016]  It started with race, and I, in 1984, was in Washington, D.C.
[01:25:14.036 --> 01:25:22.739]  when they passed the Civil Rights deal, and I said on national television, I said, this is a violation of people's fundamental rights to discriminate for whatever reason.
[01:25:23.749 --> 01:25:25.671]  And they said, well, how can that be a fundamental right?
[01:25:25.771 --> 01:25:28.074]  And I went through the same arguments and I prophesied.
[01:25:28.134 --> 01:25:35.922]  I said, eventually they're going to increase this to women, to gays, to other things, and we're living through that day today.
[01:25:35.942 --> 01:25:42.508]  I remember seeing an article yesterday, right before I went into surgery, praise God it was a successful hernia surgery.
[01:25:42.528 --> 01:25:43.449]  The doctor did a great job.
[01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:50.215]  And it was, they're going to bring the article in, it was a major university said, there it is, university requires students to apply for free speech permits.
[01:25:51.055 --> 01:25:56.360]  Content of student handouts also must be reviewed and approved by school officials, even down to speech.
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:09.790]  Kit Daniels, if you scroll down, I'll give folks the university, California Polytechnic State University, Pomona, is now requiring students to engage in free speech activities on campus to apply for a permit issued weekdays between 8 a.m.
[01:26:09.810 --> 01:26:11.752]  But it isn't just a permit for where they want to give a speech,
[01:26:12.372 --> 01:26:13.498]  With a megaphone or something.
[01:26:13.518 --> 01:26:14.584]  So that's how it started.
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:17.580]  So I was against it at UT 20 years ago.
[01:26:18.081 --> 01:26:24.482]  Now, they're saying that you have to get pre-approved for what you even utter.
[01:26:24.562 --> 01:26:29.363]  I mean, this is hard-core totalitarianism, and they call it liberal.
[01:26:29.983 --> 01:26:33.644]  Liberals, Thomas Jefferson saying religious freedom, government can't be involved.
[01:26:33.924 --> 01:26:40.726]  I mean, they invert separation of church and state, saying Congress shall make no law restricting the establishment of religion or freedom of exercise thereof.
[01:26:41.046 --> 01:26:42.566]  That says the government can't get involved.
[01:26:42.927 --> 01:26:44.587]  And so the church can do whatever it wants,
[01:26:44.907 --> 01:26:45.869]  Not the other way around.
[01:26:47.070 --> 01:26:48.713]  But that wasn't even for the First Amendment.
[01:26:49.073 --> 01:26:51.217]  In Europe, the church had sanctuary.
[01:26:51.517 --> 01:26:56.785]  Where if you could get into the church and they would hear your case, then there was no jurisdiction within those walls.
[01:26:57.126 --> 01:27:00.110]  And they just invert reality, Joel Skousen.
[01:27:01.223 --> 01:27:01.703]  That's right.
[01:27:01.963 --> 01:27:08.307]  And it's very, very important to understand that the free markets operate on judgment.
[01:27:09.107 --> 01:27:11.289]  And these are restrictions on judgment.
[01:27:11.689 --> 01:27:21.635]  Restrictions on free speech, restrictions on discriminatory judgments are restrictions on, as you say, the exercise of free will and the ability to disseminate
[01:27:22.501 --> 01:27:40.416]  Objections to the government position, and that's why I think even in the military, we do have civilian control of the military, but we ought never to say that the military cannot publicly disagree with and lobby the American public against the politicians' decisions in the military field.
[01:27:41.057 --> 01:27:50.285]  And because we have put a clamp on them, they are no longer able to protest, and that's why we get so many frustrated military people that leave because they're simply muzzled.
[01:27:50.896 --> 01:28:02.788]  Well, remember two years ago we reported it when Army PSYOPs at Fort Hood gave it to us at a rally they brought it to me and then a week later it was on Fox News and the headline of Fox News was, Are Christians the Military Extremist or Terrorist?
[01:28:03.449 --> 01:28:05.571]  And in there it said, you will be court-martialed
[01:28:06.292 --> 01:28:10.974]  Or maybe court-martialed if you're evangelical, or if you are in the Tea Party.
[01:28:11.275 --> 01:28:13.676]  Well, you can do anything you want when you're off-duty.
[01:28:14.056 --> 01:28:18.918]  Imagine, because again, people say, well, why do you say the military's so good, but now they're trying to take over?
[01:28:19.459 --> 01:28:20.619]  That's how ignorant the public is.
[01:28:20.859 --> 01:28:27.283]  The military is the most awake because they're in the middle of it and know we're telling the truth, but they're being asked to do bad things.
[01:28:27.623 --> 01:28:31.685]  The military's separate from the politicians that are commanding them.
[01:28:31.945 --> 01:28:33.326]  We're supporting the military.
[01:28:34.186 --> 01:28:39.047]  Just like you were an officer in the Marine Corps are when you fight for their free speech, correct, Joel?
[01:28:39.907 --> 01:28:40.367]  That's right.
[01:28:41.868 --> 01:28:49.789]  But there's a tremendous pressure in the military because they can threaten you with court-martials, with lack of retirement benefits, to go along and say yes.
[01:28:50.290 --> 01:28:55.391]  You know, they give lip service to the fact that there are illegal houses there.
[01:28:55.611 --> 01:29:01.552]  You could only have to follow legal orders, but they will never admit that there has ever been an illegal order.
[01:29:02.253 --> 01:29:08.601]  And in fact, if you go up as the military and say, I'm not going along with this because it's illegal, you're up for a media court-martial.
[01:29:09.261 --> 01:29:17.872]  And I don't know many judges, and I've, I'm sorry, any general officers, and I've been up against a few protesting some of the amoral policies.
[01:29:17.912 --> 01:29:20.895]  This was pre-Tailhook and the scandal in the Navy.
[01:29:21.897 --> 01:29:31.383]  And Marine Corps, and I protested some of those immoral activities to a commanding general, and he just laughed at me and said, you know, you're in the wrong service if you don't go along with this.
[01:29:31.803 --> 01:29:34.225]  And there's a tremendous amount of pressure in the military to go along.
[01:29:34.245 --> 01:29:36.466]  But you knew it was going to undermine it, all those sex parties.
[01:29:37.887 --> 01:29:39.168]  What was that, Alex?
[01:29:39.208 --> 01:29:41.950]  All the sex and the partying, you knew that was going to be used to undermine it.
[01:29:42.827 --> 01:29:43.747]  That's right.
[01:29:43.968 --> 01:29:46.709]  It has been, and we have seen tremendous corruption.
[01:29:47.049 --> 01:29:53.852]  You look at some of the hundred-odd general officers and actually only two of them were dismissed.
[01:29:54.293 --> 01:29:54.613]  Stay there.
[01:29:54.633 --> 01:29:55.413]  I want to hear about that.
[01:29:55.513 --> 01:29:56.414]  Russia and beyond.
[01:29:56.454 --> 01:29:57.254]  Stay with us.
[01:29:58.495 --> 01:29:59.415]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.895 --> 01:30:01.516]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.437 --> 01:30:05.118]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.728 --> 01:30:19.254]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:30:19.374 --> 01:30:29.139]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:30:29.299 --> 01:30:32.221]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:30:32.441 --> 01:30:33.061]  I think so.
[01:30:55.196 --> 01:30:55.596]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:55.876]  Good, brother.
[01:31:11.101 --> 01:31:12.822]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:31:13.063 --> 01:31:14.624]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:31:14.784 --> 01:31:18.787]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:31:18.807 --> 01:31:21.389]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:31:21.429 --> 01:31:23.691]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:31:23.851 --> 01:31:31.717]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[01:31:39.843 --> 01:31:41.204]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:31:41.484 --> 01:31:43.966]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[01:31:44.227 --> 01:31:47.289]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[01:31:47.549 --> 01:31:49.130]  Or maximum potency.
[01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:55.494]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience.
[01:31:55.794 --> 01:31:59.476]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[01:31:59.556 --> 01:32:01.297]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:32:01.337 --> 01:32:08.281]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from Infowarslife.

[01:32:49.656 --> 01:32:53.177]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[01:33:34.326 --> 01:33:35.987]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:36.007 --> 01:33:37.468]  We're here live, 11 a.m.
[01:33:37.488 --> 01:33:38.049]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:38.089 --> 01:33:39.490]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:44.474]  And then the InfoWars crew is back, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:33:45.134 --> 01:33:49.037]  The news websites are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:33:51.439 --> 01:33:53.880]  I don't know how anybody out there could be bored.
[01:33:54.601 --> 01:33:59.645]  We are living in epic, epic times of just incredible things happening.
[01:34:00.518 --> 01:34:08.641]  Humanoid embryos being grown up to larger size and implanted in cow uteruses to then be harvested?
[01:34:09.501 --> 01:34:10.562]  That's mainstream news.
[01:34:12.442 --> 01:34:15.883]  Spider goats around for 20 plus years, part spider, part goat.
[01:34:16.424 --> 01:34:19.885]  Cows that create human milk by the tens of thousands in China.
[01:34:20.365 --> 01:34:25.807]  Open-air pharmacological crops growing everything from chemicals to HIV for HIV vaccine.
[01:34:26.207 --> 01:34:28.428]  Who knows how this is going to mix with the environment?
[01:34:29.352 --> 01:34:31.313]  And there's no oversight to speak of.
[01:34:32.213 --> 01:34:34.274]  I mean, just thousands of insane things.
[01:34:34.674 --> 01:34:35.535]  DARPA to test.
[01:34:36.355 --> 01:34:42.758]  Submarine drone that takes off from the ocean, can lie and wait on the ocean floor for years before being launched into the skies.
[01:34:43.318 --> 01:34:44.699]  It's an autonomous robot.
[01:34:45.563 --> 01:34:47.484]  And what does Warren Buffett say?
[01:34:47.584 --> 01:34:50.806]  Robot brain to take over VA death panels.
[01:34:51.427 --> 01:34:54.028]  Company that ran Nazi death camps take over the health care.
[01:34:54.468 --> 01:35:02.133]  And Warren Buffett comes out in a speech we played earlier and says robots will decide when you live and when you die.
[01:35:02.553 --> 01:35:04.114]  Well, who programs the robots?
[01:35:04.174 --> 01:35:06.356]  It's all about the end of free will.
[01:35:07.276 --> 01:35:14.601]  Before we go any further, with Joel Skousen of WorldAffairsBrief.com, the editor, excellent publication, a lot of news there.

[01:35:27.829 --> 01:35:30.691]  We don't get stimulus money like MSNBC.
[01:35:31.631 --> 01:35:37.398]  Or the other subsidiary companies, or 400 plus million dollars of taxpayer money, like NPR.
[01:35:38.219 --> 01:35:39.941]  We are funded by your free will.
[01:35:40.261 --> 01:35:40.922]  Supporting us.
[01:35:41.282 --> 01:35:43.705]  So we bring you Made in America products in madein1776.com.
[01:35:46.701 --> 01:35:47.121]  We're good to go.
[01:36:05.811 --> 01:36:17.402]  The Molon Labe belt buckles, the long-sleeve Molon Labe shirts, all of it, a whole bunch of great designs, most of them that I came up with, so they're original, is at InfoWarsStore.com, subsection Madein1776.com.
[01:36:20.014 --> 01:36:23.457]  You can find the best nutraceuticals out there at incredible prices.

[01:36:46.705 --> 01:36:48.907]  And we won't have it for another three to six weeks.
[01:36:50.048 --> 01:36:51.389]  We've not sold out of this yet.
[01:36:51.589 --> 01:36:54.251]  It will sell out if you want Ancient Defense, Herbal Immunity Booster.
[01:36:54.631 --> 01:36:56.813]  And the best part is, all of this funds our operation.
[01:36:57.393 --> 01:36:59.715]  We don't just get up here and say, send us money to run the operation.
[01:37:00.015 --> 01:37:05.799]  We give you high quality news, analysis, reports, films, the guest.
[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:07.421]  We support other activists for freedom.
[01:37:07.961 --> 01:37:17.087]  And then we have high-quality products, very well-produced, high-quality water filtration systems like ProPure G2 that blow away the competitors.
[01:37:17.127 --> 01:37:20.149]  We have the side-by-side lab tests by third-party major labs.
[01:37:20.389 --> 01:37:25.652]  We have the taste test videos, promo code water to save 10% on all the water filtration systems.
[01:37:26.292 --> 01:37:28.194]  Don't just hear the claims out there about our systems.
[01:37:28.534 --> 01:37:29.795]  Go look at it for yourself.
[01:37:30.175 --> 01:37:31.316]  InfowarStore.com.
[01:37:32.096 --> 01:37:34.557]  Or if you have any questions or want to order over the phone, 888-253-3139.
[01:37:34.577 --> 01:37:35.057]  888-253-3139.
[01:37:35.357 --> 01:37:40.898]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:37:40.958 --> 01:37:50.060]  And finally, it was three years ago that I said we ought to make a film, a three-hour film, or roughly three hours, out of your book, Strategic Relocation.
[01:37:50.941 --> 01:37:51.561]  I got the book.
[01:37:51.681 --> 01:37:52.061]  I read it.
[01:37:52.401 --> 01:37:56.362]  I couldn't believe from my travels how accurate it was, just about the places I'd been or lived.
[01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:57.898]  I don't
[01:38:19.167 --> 01:38:26.952]  If you want to get a real map of not just here in the U.S., but every other major country, it is incredible the work Joel Skousen put into this.
[01:38:26.992 --> 01:38:36.417]  That's why his book, The Secure Home, is the Bible of secure homes and why he's such a consultant to billionaires right down to average folks and builds secure homes all over the world.
[01:38:36.717 --> 01:38:47.924]  That's another question, Joel, before we get back into tailhook and Russia and ISIS and the rest of it, you talked on our show without giving away client information years ago about former CIA, FBI building,
[01:38:48.775 --> 01:38:51.418]  More inexpensive safe houses and bunkers under their houses.
[01:38:52.619 --> 01:38:55.563]  Or, you know, really rich people building bunkers at an accelerated rate.
[01:38:55.883 --> 01:38:58.786]  Now it's been in the Guardian that they're building bunkers all over the world.
[01:38:59.107 --> 01:39:00.388]  They're building them in the Ozarks.
[01:39:00.428 --> 01:39:07.736]  They're building secret airfields in New Zealand and building garrison guard shacks and are really scared.
[01:39:07.776 --> 01:39:09.638]  And most of the billionaires have left Israel
[01:39:10.579 --> 01:39:16.865]  What is happening with this exodus of the elite and this hardening of elitist positions?
[01:39:17.646 --> 01:39:21.610]  And then Russia building giant underground bunkers, but we don't have those for the general public.
[01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:23.412]  What's going on on that front, Joel Skousen?
[01:39:24.738 --> 01:39:40.795]  Well, the answer to that is that the people in the know, insiders if you will, I'm talking about ex-CIA, DEA, anybody who's involved in the dark side of government knows that a major war is coming and it's going to be a nuclear war.
[01:39:40.855 --> 01:39:43.498]  They're not doing these bunkers because of terrorism.
[01:39:44.019 --> 01:39:45.500]  Your chances of really getting hurt
[01:39:46.101 --> 01:39:53.907]  I mean, you know, the false flag terrorism, which all the big events are, is really less than one half of one percent or less.
[01:39:54.468 --> 01:40:01.113]  But your chances of being affected by this coming nuclear war with Russia and China are absolute assured.
[01:40:01.293 --> 01:40:02.874]  Everybody's going to be affected by it.
[01:40:03.094 --> 01:40:05.556]  And so that really tells you something.
[01:40:05.676 --> 01:40:14.623]  You know, the insiders see the government building brand new deep underground bunkers, abandoning old bunkers like Cheyenne Mountain because they know they're targeted.
[01:40:15.544 --> 01:40:17.805]  So there's a whole new series of bunkers being built.
[01:40:17.885 --> 01:40:20.547]  And when they retire, they're doing the same thing.
[01:40:20.607 --> 01:40:26.430]  But you'll notice, Alex, that FEMA is not warning American people that there's any nuclear threat at all.
[01:40:27.070 --> 01:40:33.874]  But we, you know, I used to get a lot of flack from people because of my predictions about Russian China being the real target, not terrorism.
[01:40:34.414 --> 01:40:36.215]  But nobody's laughing now.
[01:40:36.455 --> 01:40:39.696]  Everybody sees Russia getting more aggressive, China getting more aggressive.
[01:40:40.197 --> 01:40:41.877]  It's really just a matter of time.
[01:40:42.277 --> 01:40:44.178]  It's driving the elite to do this.
[01:40:44.278 --> 01:40:51.241]  And I might say, even though I am aware of high-level government officials doing this, I do not design for these people.
[01:40:51.642 --> 01:40:53.883]  I will not work for ex-government.
[01:40:53.903 --> 01:40:57.664]  Sure, I know you just talked about, I guess, your other contacts and sources and them approaching you.
[01:40:58.164 --> 01:40:58.345]  Right.
[01:40:59.585 --> 01:41:13.261]  Joel, if we had the engineers, I mean if we had the time, the media people, we could go back to you 10 years ago here, 15 years ago here, you've been coming on the show 16, 17 years I guess, you've been on since about 1998 or so, if memory serves, so that's about 16, 17 years.
[01:41:15.233 --> 01:41:22.560]  But we can go back two, three years ago and you were saying China's being the new enemy, Russia, we're going to start escalating crises there.
[01:41:23.481 --> 01:41:26.965]  And then sure enough now, you're right, people say new nuclear war, that's all over.
[01:41:27.325 --> 01:41:29.567]  Now we have Boehner saying the world's on fire.
[01:41:29.908 --> 01:41:33.811]  All these top analysts saying we're in greater danger of nuclear war than any other time.
[01:41:34.592 --> 01:41:37.775]  You can see the move, you see Russia feverishly digging in.
[01:41:38.456 --> 01:41:42.743]  Building some estimates are 400 square mile underground bunkers under mountains.
[01:41:43.324 --> 01:41:45.388]  I mean, this is this is wild.
[01:41:45.989 --> 01:41:49.214]  And then you see FEMA demonizing anybody who's a prepper.
[01:41:50.572 --> 01:41:51.753]  And you can see it.
[01:41:52.013 --> 01:42:02.002]  Finance the radical Islamists, get some attacks going, use the Islamic threat as the cover for the hardening and the domestic police state that emerges after the war.
[01:42:02.343 --> 01:42:06.967]  And you can really see that more and more your analysis is coming true.
[01:42:07.547 --> 01:42:12.672]  Going back, how long ago did you come up with this hypothesis and why did you come up with it?
[01:42:14.246 --> 01:42:23.890]  Well, I came up with it clear back in the 80s, believe it or not, and published it in 1998 when I was starting my World Affairs Brief.
[01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:29.291]  I put out my general theory in a piece called Strategic Threats of the Coming Decade.
[01:42:30.212 --> 01:42:35.834]  And the reason I came up with this is because I continued to see how the CIA was covering
[01:42:36.414 --> 01:42:39.639]  For Russian war preparations.
[01:42:39.759 --> 01:42:48.332]  In 1997, for example, the New York Times published the first article on this big 400 square mile underground bunker system in Yamato Mountain.
[01:42:49.443 --> 01:42:50.684]  In the Ural Mountains of Russia.
[01:42:51.644 --> 01:42:55.946]  And it basically was a cover piece to downplay the issue.
[01:42:55.966 --> 01:42:58.907]  They went to the CIA and said, what about this underground bunker system?
[01:42:59.427 --> 01:43:01.708]  Oh yeah, we know about it, but we're not worried about it.
[01:43:01.788 --> 01:43:02.909]  It's just defensive.
[01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:07.370]  And you know, I asked the immediate question, how do they know it's defensive?
[01:43:07.390 --> 01:43:08.411]  They've never been in it.
[01:43:09.091 --> 01:43:16.035]  General Hobbiger of our Strategic Missile Command admitted the United States inspectors have never been in Yamato Mountain.
[01:43:16.555 --> 01:43:18.816]  It's got six railroad lines going in.
[01:43:19.196 --> 01:43:25.539]  Russians claim it's for mining, but you never see any mining cars other than removing earth, you know, coming out of it.
[01:43:25.579 --> 01:43:30.262]  There's nothing going in there except factory closed boxcars.
[01:43:30.402 --> 01:43:33.823]  I think they're building underground nuclear factories, missile factories.
[01:43:34.284 --> 01:43:36.505]  They're going to be able to continue to wage war
[01:43:37.145 --> 01:43:38.927]  Even after nuclear war starts.
[01:43:39.988 --> 01:43:42.250]  So I've warned about this for many years.
[01:43:42.810 --> 01:43:45.733]  It's not possible necessarily to predict when it's going to happen.
[01:43:45.933 --> 01:43:48.335]  I think we're dealing with multiple conspiracies here.
[01:43:48.375 --> 01:43:58.604]  We have our globalist, Anglo-American globalist conspiracy trying to take down our liberty, who are actively helping Russia and China arm.
[01:43:58.904 --> 01:44:02.948]  Just like the West has declassified, basically helped build up Hitler.
[01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:04.620]  That's exactly right.
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:14.925]  They're building up enemies in order to create a major crisis to justify the kinds of militarization of police, taking down of dissidents, FEMA camps and prisons, as we've been talking about.
[01:44:15.005 --> 01:44:16.946]  It's going to take a war to justify that.
[01:44:17.466 --> 01:44:20.367]  And they want that war, but they cannot control the war.
[01:44:20.407 --> 01:44:21.388]  They can't start it.
[01:44:21.408 --> 01:44:22.748]  They have to make it look like... That's right.
[01:44:22.828 --> 01:44:27.831]  Because the globalist enemy is the Russians and the American people, and anybody else under their control.
[01:44:27.851 --> 01:44:29.271]  So it's the old trick of the book.
[01:44:29.671 --> 01:44:33.013]  Cause the cataclysm so you can then have the excuse to take over completely.
[01:44:33.925 --> 01:44:42.328]  Right, and they're going to use what better excuse to be able to justify a militarized global government where we lose our sovereignty than a nuclear attack on the U.S.
[01:44:42.388 --> 01:44:43.009]  military.
[01:44:43.029 --> 01:44:45.990]  Now everyone says that's inconceivable that the U.S.
[01:44:46.010 --> 01:44:48.111]  government would want an attack and destroy the U.S.
[01:44:48.371 --> 01:44:49.271]  What does the real U.S.
[01:44:49.311 --> 01:44:51.512]  government, the Justice Department, Homeland Security say?
[01:44:51.692 --> 01:44:53.533]  They say the veterans are the enemy.
[01:44:54.053 --> 01:44:54.233]  Yeah.
[01:44:54.814 --> 01:44:59.036]  But you see, our government knows that Russia and China don't intend to nuke cities.
[01:44:59.717 --> 01:45:02.518]  They intend to nuke the military and then blackmail the U.S.
[01:45:02.638 --> 01:45:03.359]  into submission.
[01:45:03.559 --> 01:45:07.762]  You know, Russia and China want to run their own version of the New World Order under their control.
[01:45:08.182 --> 01:45:10.463]  And eventually they plan to attack each other, too.
[01:45:10.644 --> 01:45:13.505]  I mean, they're predators that are temporarily joined.
[01:45:14.246 --> 01:45:18.789]  But the Western globalists are the most insidious, in my opinion, satanic
[01:45:19.449 --> 01:45:20.451]  Revealed and driven.
[01:45:20.471 --> 01:45:24.856]  It's the only way to explain this conspiracy that's been going on for a couple hundred years.
[01:45:26.118 --> 01:45:28.561]  Do they have the blessing of the devil in your research?
[01:45:28.581 --> 01:45:33.869]  Do you think the Anglo-American establishment is actually going to be at the core of the satanic takeover?
[01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:35.290]  Or are they going to be betrayed as well?
[01:45:36.024 --> 01:45:37.745]  No, I think they're going to be the core.
[01:45:37.785 --> 01:45:39.766]  They're the ones that are intended to win.
[01:45:39.846 --> 01:45:42.708]  I think Russia's going to go down in the next Third World War.
[01:45:42.848 --> 01:45:54.754]  I think China will be induced to attack Russia's rear at some point during the war in exchange for more and more military assistance, just like we gave Stalin during World War II.
[01:45:55.255 --> 01:45:59.057]  And then you see, that serves globalist purposes too, because after the war,
[01:45:59.677 --> 01:46:11.666]  Then you've got a new Cold War enemy, a huge China military, and the globalists can say that's why we have to keep this global military force in force, and that's why we can't go back to individual sovereignty.
[01:46:11.746 --> 01:46:19.452]  And in fact, we see a NATO army and now a new Arab unified army being put together, at least those that are puppet states to the West.
[01:46:20.478 --> 01:46:25.202]  And I think those will merge eventually through the Middle East war that will come up.
[01:46:25.762 --> 01:46:33.028]  Through this Iran deal, it will merge into the beginning of this global military that we're going to have to face someday.
[01:46:33.429 --> 01:46:38.073]  That Americans will plead for, basically, because our military has been taken down.
[01:46:38.113 --> 01:46:40.935]  And the reason our military is going to be taken down is the U.S.
[01:46:41.916 --> 01:46:48.982]  government is not going to give the nuclear codes so that we can respond until after we've absorbed a nuclear first strike.
[01:46:50.035 --> 01:47:00.548]  And I've written about that extensively, PDD 60, that secret order instructing the military to not rely on launch on warning, but to be prepared to absorb a nuclear first strike.
[01:47:00.588 --> 01:47:04.092]  I think you're going to see that happen, and it's going to take out the military.
[01:47:04.112 --> 01:47:06.875]  And that's why as much as I'm in favor of
[01:47:08.516 --> 01:47:14.338]  Defending our country and military service, I do no longer recommend that good people join the military.
[01:47:14.438 --> 01:47:15.958]  Our government will not protect you.
[01:47:16.438 --> 01:47:19.719]  They're setting up the military to take the hit in this next war.
[01:47:20.259 --> 01:47:28.222]  And if you're in the military, it's not enough that the vaccines that are forced upon you, but if you're in the military, chances are very, very high that you're going to be nuked.
[01:47:30.162 --> 01:47:30.983]  And the time frame 2020-2025?
[01:47:33.914 --> 01:47:40.160]  I can't tell when it's going to happen, but I can tell you I don't think Russia and China are ready until the beginning of the next decade.
[01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:43.864]  All of their top-line new weapon systems aren't coming online.
[01:47:43.924 --> 01:47:44.504]  I admit that.
[01:47:44.604 --> 01:47:46.986]  In fact, their deadline is about 2021, they say.
[01:47:47.607 --> 01:47:57.677]  And they may be cheating a little bit, but I'll tell you, it just takes years to build the kinds of blue-water navy things that China needs, the new submarines, the new aircraft carriers.
[01:47:58.177 --> 01:48:02.822]  They're not relying a lot on aircraft carriers, by the way, because they know that's obsolete technology.
[01:48:02.922 --> 01:48:03.462]  Submarines.
[01:48:03.823 --> 01:48:09.508]  Super hyper-missiles and nuclear weapons, you can take out aircraft carrier task force in an instant.
[01:48:10.069 --> 01:48:11.630]  Absolutely, and you've operated off those.
[01:48:11.670 --> 01:48:15.174]  Well, RT reports, and again, when we're being told about something...
[01:48:16.266 --> 01:48:31.167]  It's already there, and this is what I was told by a lot of folks, plus it's been admitted a long time ago they were developing this, that they have these basically subs, well these containers, these packages, that sit on the bottom, they pop open, the device goes to the surface, it's basically a huge...
[01:48:32.358 --> 01:48:38.245]  Cruise missile carrying other smaller cruise missiles, then it goes in below the radar and takes out targets.
[01:48:38.706 --> 01:48:45.374]  I mean, for me, in my research into nukes, isn't this really the ultimate weapon compared to even space base or ICBM?
[01:48:45.715 --> 01:48:50.380]  Isn't this what's hard to really shoot down even if you think you have jamming equipment on the ground, Joel?
[01:48:51.585 --> 01:48:54.007]  It is, and a lot of it depends on the jamming.
[01:48:54.027 --> 01:48:56.950]  This is a real high-tech war that both Russia and the U.S.
[01:48:57.010 --> 01:48:57.931]  are preparing for.
[01:48:58.131 --> 01:49:00.113]  Russia feels like they've got the electronic.
[01:49:00.193 --> 01:49:02.675]  That's why they permit the U.S.
[01:49:02.695 --> 01:49:06.178]  to take down Iraq, even though they promised to defend Saddam Hussein.
[01:49:06.638 --> 01:49:08.080]  They learn more about U.S.
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:11.603]  military technology by eavesdropping on our war capabilities against
[01:49:11.863 --> 01:49:12.924]  Defenseless countries.
[01:49:14.105 --> 01:49:20.189]  And that's the reason we can go in and obliterate any country we attack because we can jam all their radar.
[01:49:20.369 --> 01:49:24.912]  All of the stuff that Russia sends over that can be jammed, we can go in almost undetected.
[01:49:25.793 --> 01:49:32.277]  And this new, and I've always said, the reason why the globalists who run our government are
[01:49:33.698 --> 01:49:50.921]  I'm going to let the military take him down as they have secret weapon systems that they can be used afterwards to keep any further attacks from happening and I think what you've just described are some of those top secret weapon systems that can then keep the enemy at bay while we regroup under the name of a globalist military.
[01:49:51.772 --> 01:49:52.192]  That's right.
[01:49:52.372 --> 01:49:53.253]  I mean, it's real simple.
[01:49:53.273 --> 01:49:56.955]  You just got a container on the bottom of the ocean, totally undetected, turned off.
[01:49:57.515 --> 01:50:02.718]  It gets activated by some of these different classified systems.
[01:50:02.738 --> 01:50:06.480]  They've got systems that shoot a radio wave through the earth, activated satellites, you name it.
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:08.921]  What about the incredible reliance on GPS?
[01:50:09.281 --> 01:50:13.603]  We know the Chinese and the Russians plan to shoot down, in a matter of hours, the GPS satellites.
[01:50:14.184 --> 01:50:15.164]  Do they have backups?
[01:50:15.264 --> 01:50:16.505]  Are they going to go back to these
[01:50:18.906 --> 01:50:23.511]  Antenna systems that they use to communicate through the earth that they've got up by Dallas.
[01:50:23.551 --> 01:50:24.792]  I mean, what's the plan there?
[01:50:25.919 --> 01:50:28.921]  There are two plans, according to my sources.
[01:50:29.161 --> 01:50:40.449]  One is backups, which they have several satellites ready to be launched, but more interestingly is they have backups already in space that are turned off and that cannot be detected.
[01:50:40.849 --> 01:50:49.575]  So when certain ones are shot down, the obvious ones, they simply turn on others and deplete, you know, the resources, the anti-sat resources.
[01:50:49.595 --> 01:50:50.335]  That's what I was told.
[01:50:50.395 --> 01:50:51.276]  It's a miniaturization.
[01:50:51.316 --> 01:50:54.658]  They've got packages up there where a whole bunch of backups are then released.
[01:50:54.998 --> 01:50:55.599]  It's amazing.
[01:50:55.859 --> 01:51:00.222]  Joel Skousen, we're talking near future, which is already our present.
[01:51:00.562 --> 01:51:01.682]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:51:25.684 --> 01:51:27.607]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.

[01:51:41.024 --> 01:51:41.764]  Hey, Boomer!
[01:51:42.024 --> 01:51:45.345]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:45.465 --> 01:51:47.045]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[01:51:47.125 --> 01:51:48.885]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:49.085 --> 01:51:54.566]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:54.926 --> 01:51:55.667]  I know, right?
[01:51:55.747 --> 01:51:56.707]  You love it too!
[01:51:57.067 --> 01:51:58.367]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too.
[01:51:58.507 --> 01:51:59.407]  Let's go get some!
[01:51:59.527 --> 01:52:01.228]  Get Berkey Clean Water by calling 877-886-3653.
[01:52:01.268 --> 01:52:01.448]  That's 877-886-3653.

[01:52:10.029 --> 01:52:10.909]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:52:10.949 --> 01:52:11.370]  Good, brother.
[01:52:11.530 --> 01:52:13.311]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:52:13.491 --> 01:52:15.031]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:52:15.191 --> 01:52:19.213]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:52:19.233 --> 01:52:19.954]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:52:19.974 --> 01:52:24.095]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:52:24.275 --> 01:52:32.119]  Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:52:32.439 --> 01:52:35.563]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:52:35.683 --> 01:52:37.185]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:52:37.225 --> 01:52:40.108]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:52:40.128 --> 01:52:41.710]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:44.393]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[01:52:44.653 --> 01:52:46.235]  Harvested around the planet.
[01:52:47.176 --> 01:52:49.277]  Why use dial-up when you can use broadband?
[01:52:49.317 --> 01:52:50.618]  Why travel with this?
[01:53:15.481 --> 01:53:16.502]  When you can use this.
[01:53:17.323 --> 01:53:22.888]  And why would anyone use colloidal or ionic silver when you can use supernatural silver?
[01:53:23.308 --> 01:53:30.094]  Supernatural silver is state-of-the-art and it's been clinically proven to be several hundred times more effective than those other silvers.
[01:53:30.535 --> 01:53:36.100]  It's powerful enough to protect you and your family from the threat of deadly viruses, bacteria and fungus.
[01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:39.723]  But it's so safe that it can be used internally or topically.
[01:53:40.183 --> 01:53:44.324]  And you'll never again deal with the nasty side effects of harsh drugs or antibiotics.
[01:53:44.885 --> 01:53:55.088]  Hundreds of scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals, and research institutions have all shown Supernatural Silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against invading pathogens.
[01:53:55.408 --> 01:53:58.349]  Supernatural Silver is a must-have for your arsenal.

[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:40.583]  You know what's frustrating?
[01:54:42.988 --> 01:54:47.759]  Wozniak, one of the founders of Apple, I think he's like worth like eight billion dollars last time I checked.
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:50.321]  Invented so many things we use today.
[01:54:50.381 --> 01:54:56.467]  Came out last week in a speech and said, AI is being designed to end humans' usefulness.
[01:54:57.307 --> 01:55:03.993]  The architecture is being set up, basically echoing what I've said, others have said, to where we're building a world that's not for people.
[01:55:04.574 --> 01:55:08.958]  And of course, that's what Bill Joyce said 16 years ago in Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
[01:55:09.979 --> 01:55:14.843]  And Wired Magazine, himself a billionaire, one of the owners of Sun Microsystems, co-chairman.
[01:55:18.422 --> 01:55:29.929]  What we're talking about is a predatory system, and Joel Skousen has agreed to stay with us 20-30 minutes, as long as he can, into the next hour to take your phone calls on any specific questions for him, or if you agree or disagree.
[01:55:30.250 --> 01:55:32.111]  Specifically for Joel Skousen.
[01:55:32.651 --> 01:55:34.693]  He'll be with us 20-30 minutes into the next hour.
[01:55:34.713 --> 01:55:34.753]  800-259-9231.
[01:55:34.773 --> 01:55:34.813]  800-259-9231.
[01:55:43.953 --> 01:55:49.656]  Specifically for him, first-time callers, 800-259-9231.
[01:55:51.297 --> 01:56:02.763]  But Joel, pulling back from this, the more I research it, the more I see how it operates, you really come face-to-face with the fact, in their own writings they admit they're into the occult.
[01:56:03.384 --> 01:56:08.767]  These are people that believe they serve the God of this world, who if they carry out these plans,
[01:56:09.861 --> 01:56:13.102]  Will be given eternal life through the machines.
[01:56:13.302 --> 01:56:14.262]  They will escape judgment.
[01:56:14.522 --> 01:56:18.662]  You and I have talked about this before, but folks need to understand, this isn't us saying this.
[01:56:19.123 --> 01:56:21.583]  This is what we get out of Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove.
[01:56:21.843 --> 01:56:25.744]  This is what Ray Kurzweil and all these guys are saying.
[01:56:26.144 --> 01:56:28.244]  They're now externalizing the hierarchy.
[01:56:28.544 --> 01:56:30.525]  They're now selling this to the general public.
[01:56:30.905 --> 01:56:32.665]  Accept giving up your humanity.
[01:56:33.205 --> 01:56:38.646]  Turn yourself over to the robots making the decisions, and you will be allowed to live forever
[01:56:39.839 --> 01:56:41.620]  How would anyone believe these people?
[01:56:42.441 --> 01:56:44.262]  It's just so fantastical.
[01:56:44.723 --> 01:56:45.783]  It's out of this world.
[01:56:46.464 --> 01:56:47.304]  It is satanic.
[01:56:47.324 --> 01:56:48.005]  Can you speak to that?
[01:56:49.656 --> 01:56:55.599]  Well, what drives the globalist is that, you know, everybody has a conscience.
[01:56:55.639 --> 01:56:57.620]  Everybody is part of humanity.
[01:56:57.660 --> 01:57:04.303]  You get information from a divine source criticizing you, prompting you to do the right thing.
[01:57:04.503 --> 01:57:09.906]  And people who are bad, who want to do the thing, they are in constant rebellion against conscience.
[01:57:09.946 --> 01:57:10.787]  And there's another voice
[01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:20.667]  Comes through that center of the mind that perceives spiritual information from Satan, you know, temptations, trying to get you to do things, countering what the Lord wants you to do.
[01:57:20.787 --> 01:57:21.728]  Oh, you don't want to do that.
[01:57:22.469 --> 01:57:24.210]  You're too tired or you want to do this.
[01:57:25.751 --> 01:57:35.439]  Ultimately, the people who migrate towards the dark side end up with a real problem is that they inwardly still know there's going to be a judgment day someday.
[01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:40.323]  And what the oil that makes the conspiracy work is the promise of immunity.
[01:57:41.204 --> 01:57:42.465]  We see it on Earth.
[01:57:42.505 --> 01:57:44.485]  They promise them immunity from prosecution.
[01:57:44.525 --> 01:57:51.848]  You look at the people who get off Scott Free, this IRS director who Congress isn't going to prosecute for contempt.
[01:57:51.968 --> 01:57:52.609]  She should be.
[01:57:53.189 --> 01:57:53.869]  Why does that happen?
[01:57:53.929 --> 01:57:54.990]  Why do some people get off?
[01:57:55.050 --> 01:57:56.530]  Because they're part of the system.
[01:57:56.570 --> 01:57:57.551]  They've got immunity.
[01:57:57.611 --> 01:57:59.611]  Bill Clinton obviously had immunity.
[01:58:00.172 --> 01:58:00.892]  They got him off.
[01:58:01.252 --> 01:58:03.213]  And it's not just the Democrats that get him off.
[01:58:03.293 --> 01:58:05.234]  It's the Republicans that buy into this too.
[01:58:05.874 --> 01:58:11.059]  But ultimately I think, and this is my own theory, Alex, that there's a larger promise of immunity.
[01:58:12.236 --> 01:58:24.499]  To probably only at the higher revelatory states to the top levels of globalism who probably do have their own revelation or seance with Satan or God of this world.
[01:58:24.959 --> 01:58:30.540]  They're promised immunity from God's judgment if he helps them overthrow what is good in life.
[01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:32.881]  And they need immunity from God's judgment.
[01:58:32.901 --> 01:58:34.461]  I mean, they've got a mountain of sins.
[01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:36.741]  They're facing the chains of hell.
[01:58:37.422 --> 01:58:39.222]  They try not to believe it, but it's there.
[01:58:39.582 --> 01:58:40.162]  They feel it.
[01:58:40.463 --> 01:58:41.383]  They know it's true.
[01:58:41.804 --> 01:58:42.464]  And they understand.
[01:58:42.484 --> 01:58:43.065]  They're scared.
[01:58:43.365 --> 01:58:44.265]  Back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:44.326 --> 01:58:46.487]  I want you to continue getting into this.
[01:58:46.587 --> 01:58:47.428]  It's the big secret.
[01:58:47.448 --> 01:58:48.569]  They don't want you to know about, folks.
[01:58:48.989 --> 01:58:49.489]  Third hour.
[01:58:49.509 --> 01:58:50.350]  Call your friends and family.
[01:58:50.370 --> 01:58:51.811]  Tell them to tune in now.
[01:58:51.851 --> 01:58:52.512]  Email everybody.
[01:58:53.452 --> 01:58:54.473]  Get folks to tune in now.
[01:58:54.513 --> 01:58:55.454]  They need to hear this, folks.

[01:59:54.483 --> 01:59:56.525]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:12.728 --> 02:00:14.010]  Joe Skousen's our guest.
[02:00:14.891 --> 02:00:16.093]  We're fighting Big Brother.
[02:00:16.753 --> 02:00:17.795]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:18.536 --> 02:00:19.617]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:20.298 --> 02:00:21.099]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:22.802]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.422 --> 02:00:26.887]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.907 --> 02:00:27.628]  And now we're back.
[02:00:27.648 --> 02:00:30.011]  And now, live from Austin, Texas.
[02:00:30.912 --> 02:00:33.014]  This is a short five-minute segment.
[02:00:33.034 --> 02:00:35.676]  I want to come back, take calls, get to other news I haven't covered yet.
[02:00:36.157 --> 02:00:37.638]  The whole program is accelerating.
[02:00:38.038 --> 02:00:52.450]  It's gone from them denying this planetary plan to admitting it's a planetary takeover, and that it's even authoritarian, as the Financial Times of London did a few years ago, but saying it's a good totalitarianism, while separately attacking us for saying it's not a good plan.
[02:00:54.090 --> 02:00:55.330]  Joel Skousen, this is a short segment.
[02:00:55.350 --> 02:01:01.332]  I want to give you the floor to finish up getting into free will, why they're attacking it.
[02:01:01.592 --> 02:01:03.453]  They claim they're here to empower people.
[02:01:03.993 --> 02:01:08.794]  The truth is they're openly here to enslave people and ultimately end humanity as we know it.
[02:01:09.174 --> 02:01:19.697]  And you were getting into this attack on free will, and then at the highest level of the pyramid, Satan wants to play God because he wants to escape judgment as well, not just his minions.
[02:01:21.203 --> 02:01:23.966]  Well, you know, you talk about Empower, the promise of Empower.
[02:01:24.006 --> 02:01:30.494]  There's a lot of subtle enticements that this satanic conspiracy operates.
[02:01:30.754 --> 02:01:37.983]  You know, very few at the top level, except the top level, I think, have a regulatory relationship with Satan.
[02:01:38.083 --> 02:01:40.506]  You know, there's this generational effect in this conspiracy.
[02:01:40.526 --> 02:01:42.469]  It goes on generation after generation.
[02:01:43.069 --> 02:01:52.181]  No single person could design a system of conflict so complex that would exceed his lifetime three times and plan that and see that it's carried forth.
[02:01:52.221 --> 02:01:54.484]  It has to be revelatory in nature.
[02:01:55.407 --> 02:02:06.553]  But most of the people at the second and third and fourth level down from the hierarchy, they use all kinds of inducements, climbing the ladder, wine women saw on the promise of immunity, other things to keep people.
[02:02:07.073 --> 02:02:12.436]  They even hire mostly just predictable people that they don't have to tell there's a conspiracy operating.
[02:02:12.896 --> 02:02:16.758]  They will do the liberal agenda because they've shown that proclivity.
[02:02:17.198 --> 02:02:19.799]  But for the general public, they promise empowerment.
[02:02:20.199 --> 02:02:25.521]  But what that really means is empowerment through government power, through linking yourself with government.
[02:02:25.961 --> 02:02:27.882]  That's how they lure in these corporations.
[02:02:28.262 --> 02:02:31.343]  We give you first contracts and think we'll make you wealthy.
[02:02:31.903 --> 02:02:38.386]  In fact, you cannot hardly compete nowadays in a tough economy without government contracts and these insider relations.
[02:02:38.666 --> 02:02:40.087]  So it's empowerment through government
[02:02:41.067 --> 02:02:52.372]  The free market runs on the empowerment through good judgment, through the proper use of self-control, through listening to conscience, rather than a rule-making approach.
[02:02:52.432 --> 02:02:53.593]  It's a very fluid thing.
[02:02:53.913 --> 02:02:57.635]  And the serious thing about this conscience that I've been talking about,
[02:02:58.618 --> 02:03:08.440]  Is that these meds that are mood altering drugs actually I have found dead in the center of the mind which receives divine inspiration.
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:09.220]  It deadens it.
[02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:26.203]  And that's why there's such a very interesting relationship between these mood altering drugs and the withdrawal from them that allow Satan to come in and have near total compulsion there to drive people to suicide and do other evil things such as been happening.
[02:03:26.403 --> 02:03:39.007]  But going back to what I was saying about the immunity pact that makes this drive, at the highest levels, there's this promise of making you safe from the judgments of God, and that's very attractive to a lot of people who have a lot of sins.
[02:03:40.027 --> 02:03:53.472]  And, you know, there's a vision that Isaiah had about that in Isaiah chapter 14, where he talks about seeing all of the great and powerful in prison, in the chains of hell.
[02:03:54.412 --> 02:04:02.260]  And that kind of gives you an indication that the great and powerful of the world will get that way because of this pact with Satan, the Faustian Pact, if you will.
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:11.930]  And then they see Satan descend, or he that was going to thrash the world with the power of his hand, descend into hell in chains, and they realize
[02:04:12.611 --> 02:04:13.432]  The jig is up.
[02:04:13.972 --> 02:04:15.634]  He's not going to be able to save them.
[02:04:15.674 --> 02:04:18.957]  And they utter, art thou become low like unto us.
[02:04:19.657 --> 02:04:27.465]  I think that's a type and a parable of indicating that of this pact that's been going on since the beginning of the time.
[02:04:27.765 --> 02:04:30.587]  Work with me and I'll promise to dethrone God.
[02:04:31.068 --> 02:04:32.970]  You won't suffer the chains of hell.
[02:04:33.130 --> 02:04:36.113]  Then they see him eventually descend into hell and they realize
[02:04:36.793 --> 02:04:37.514]  It didn't work.
[02:04:37.774 --> 02:04:41.479]  They are so deceived though in my gut, in my spirit, but historically as well.
[02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:44.583]  You can see the fall of tyrants always comes.
[02:04:45.324 --> 02:04:47.607]  You can see that the elite are following Lucifer.
[02:04:47.987 --> 02:04:49.389]  Don't they know he will fall?
[02:04:52.776 --> 02:04:53.176]  They don't.
[02:04:53.516 --> 02:04:53.937]  It works.
[02:04:54.357 --> 02:04:56.860]  What I'm just saying, he lures in a lot of people.
[02:04:56.880 --> 02:04:59.784]  Yeah, but I can see being lured by sin.
[02:04:59.804 --> 02:05:02.627]  I mean, we're all sinners, but I know it's bad.
[02:05:02.767 --> 02:05:03.568]  I know it loses.
[02:05:03.708 --> 02:05:06.211]  I just, I guess they've been given over to great delusion.
[02:05:06.332 --> 02:05:07.793]  Powerful interview with Joel Skousen.
[02:05:08.094 --> 02:05:08.814]  More straight ahead.
[02:05:08.935 --> 02:05:09.075]  Wow.
[02:05:09.535 --> 02:05:13.737]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.

[02:06:16.019 --> 02:06:17.039]  Security alert.
[02:06:17.259 --> 02:06:18.979]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:19.880]  Analysis.
[02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:22.941]  InfoWars building independent media operations.
[02:06:22.961 --> 02:06:27.802]  But the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:06:27.842 --> 02:06:28.802]  Crime Directive.
[02:06:28.882 --> 02:06:30.343]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:06:30.423 --> 02:06:33.203]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:06:33.283 --> 02:06:36.324]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:06:36.524 --> 02:06:38.685]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:06:39.005 --> 02:06:40.325]  People are assaulting us.
[02:06:40.345 --> 02:06:42.666]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:06:43.166 --> 02:06:44.827]  They're never going to stop.
[02:06:45.107 --> 02:06:49.048]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:06:49.148 --> 02:06:52.329]  Block free iPhone ads at Infowars.com.
[02:06:52.749 --> 02:06:55.410]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[02:06:56.110 --> 02:06:56.850]  Imperative.
[02:06:57.090 --> 02:06:59.111]  Destroy prison-finished TV.
[02:06:59.131 --> 02:07:03.532]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:07:03.812 --> 02:07:05.153]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:07:05.193 --> 02:07:05.933]  You can feel it.
[02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:09.801]  The experts are clear.
[02:07:10.141 --> 02:07:17.107]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:07:17.267 --> 02:07:23.513]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:23.533 --> 02:07:27.136]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.

[02:07:36.783 --> 02:07:37.684]  Not our iodine.
[02:07:37.804 --> 02:07:41.366]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:07:41.606 --> 02:07:43.928]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:08:27.049 --> 02:08:31.493]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:08:32.094 --> 02:08:33.555]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:35.797 --> 02:08:39.821]  Generals gathered in their masses.
[02:08:39.861 --> 02:08:41.402]  Just like witches at black masses.
[02:08:41.422 --> 02:08:44.325]  Just like witches at black masses.
[02:08:44.365 --> 02:08:46.527]  That's what these big evil wars are about.
[02:08:46.547 --> 02:08:48.749]  Blood sacrifice to the god of this world.
[02:08:48.849 --> 02:08:52.232]  You know, Satan has already fallen.
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:57.182]  But he'll have another fall and not be in control of this planet anymore.
[02:08:57.662 --> 02:08:59.823]  And, look, I have a personal relationship with Christ.
[02:08:59.984 --> 02:09:00.904]  I know this stuff's true.
[02:09:01.324 --> 02:09:02.605]  I infiltrated Bohemian Grove.
[02:09:02.625 --> 02:09:05.327]  The only person to ever get in and out and not get arrested.
[02:09:06.067 --> 02:09:06.707]  I'm not bragging.
[02:09:06.727 --> 02:09:07.908]  That was God's hand in that.
[02:09:07.948 --> 02:09:10.930]  I was questioned by the Secret Service and by sheriff's deputies.
[02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:12.230]  Didn't even lie to them.
[02:09:12.270 --> 02:09:14.412]  I just said, I'm here visiting the Hillbillies.
[02:09:14.452 --> 02:09:15.452]  That's the Bush's club.
[02:09:17.433 --> 02:09:18.274]  They said, are you a member?
[02:09:18.434 --> 02:09:19.715]  I would say, no, I'm visiting.
[02:09:20.455 --> 02:09:21.556]  And I did go visit their camp.
[02:09:22.659 --> 02:09:23.219]  They weren't there.
[02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:24.380]  They were off getting drunk.
[02:09:25.261 --> 02:09:30.164]  And you could laugh at the ritual there in 2000, 16 years ago.
[02:09:30.184 --> 02:09:33.387]  It's in my film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:09:33.887 --> 02:09:41.812]  And during the ritual, with over a thousand worldly, powerful billionaires and others, movie stars, you name it, watching them do the Moloch ritual.
[02:09:43.314 --> 02:09:44.714]  People say, Moloch is, uh...
[02:09:46.314 --> 02:09:48.497]  You know, a bull, not an owl.
[02:09:48.818 --> 02:09:49.899]  This is all interchangeable.
[02:09:49.939 --> 02:09:51.241]  It really is a bull if you look at it.
[02:09:51.261 --> 02:09:52.523]  It's a horned owl slash bull.
[02:09:52.884 --> 02:09:54.366]  They burn a child in heaven to kill it.
[02:09:54.806 --> 02:09:56.990]  Those men were in religious ecstasy.
[02:09:57.130 --> 02:10:01.095]  I grew up a Southern Baptist slash evangelical slash Methodist.
[02:10:02.090 --> 02:10:10.292]  We would go to all those churches, because my grandmother and my dad's dad was a Methodist, his dad was a Baptist, my mom's family was Southern Baptist, so I went to... We also had evangelical churches we went to.
[02:10:11.333 --> 02:10:15.314]  I haven't seen ecstasy people in religious rapture like I did at Bohemian Grove.
[02:10:15.774 --> 02:10:26.617]  And I, with Mike Hanson who was there with me, simply said, my sidekick at the time, Mike now does a great job in private business, I thought I'd have him on as a guest sometime, but he's so humble, he's seen it all.
[02:10:27.935 --> 02:10:32.278]  I said, this is very interesting, and those men looked at me like they wanted to tear my head off.
[02:10:32.378 --> 02:10:51.291]  They were there just like the ancient Jews, in a good way, but this was a bad way, wanted to go to the temple and have the priest go beyond the veil to relieve them of their sins, to have the blood pass over them, so that the judgment, the angel of death wouldn't get them.
[02:10:51.952 --> 02:10:53.653]  That was what I was seeing, and they even
[02:10:55.011 --> 02:10:56.052]  He talked about Faust.
[02:10:56.092 --> 02:11:07.359]  It was a mix of Faust, Canaanite, Babylonian, Druidic magic, Men in Power as a political retrospective, written by the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
[02:11:07.660 --> 02:11:09.961]  He says, we have our own groves we do rituals in.
[02:11:09.981 --> 02:11:11.442]  I have blow-ups of the book and the film.
[02:11:11.983 --> 02:11:13.023]  The book's back there on the bookshelf.
[02:11:13.564 --> 02:11:16.285]  That guy, I think it's back on that bookshelf in there in that room, in that studio.
[02:11:17.226 --> 02:11:24.151]  And he says, but I love the rituals at Bohemian Grove, and more gets done with the Trilateral Commission and CFR there.
[02:11:25.410 --> 02:11:28.531]  And then they admit in mainstream news it's giant gay orgies.
[02:11:29.032 --> 02:11:29.992]  Homosexual orgies.
[02:11:31.152 --> 02:11:36.275]  And so, you need to understand, it's all about rebellion against the order of things.
[02:11:37.415 --> 02:11:38.576]  And it leads to destruction.
[02:11:38.776 --> 02:11:41.497]  And I'm not here at some level of hating gay people.
[02:11:42.177 --> 02:11:48.560]  It's that, historically, whether it's Sodom and Gomorrah, or the fall of Rome, or now, that is pushed at the center of it.
[02:11:49.420 --> 02:11:53.062]  Joel Scalzin, final comments on this deal with the devil, then I want to go to some phone calls.
[02:11:54.346 --> 02:12:08.260]  Well, it works by the lure of immunity at the top, the immunity against the chains of hell, and at the lower levels, immunity against earthly sins by controlling judges and Congress and other aspects of law enforcement.
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:09.401]  As above, so below.
[02:12:10.422 --> 02:12:10.823]  That's right.
[02:12:12.705 --> 02:12:13.746]  At various forms of
[02:12:16.741 --> 02:12:21.342]  You know, control, and it's very important to have the control of the judiciary.
[02:12:21.902 --> 02:12:24.443]  So this system is not going away.
[02:12:24.463 --> 02:12:29.684]  At best, what we can do, I think, is to try to build a resistance movement.
[02:12:29.964 --> 02:12:37.666]  And that's why, even though I don't believe that we're powerful enough to stop them, I think that we have to educate as many people to build the remnant.
[02:12:38.666 --> 02:12:56.140]  The remnant which God will inspire to resist and ultimately I think the second coming comes to stop the satanic control and to take it down and then they will know that the promises of immunity do not hold and that they will in fact experience the chains of hell.
[02:12:56.340 --> 02:13:02.027]  But really, it does drive them tremendously to have this promise of immunity.
[02:13:02.087 --> 02:13:03.428]  It's very, very effective.
[02:13:03.829 --> 02:13:08.935]  You're seeing it all through history, and we're watching it at this very time.
[02:13:11.198 --> 02:13:15.619]  God is a just God and gives us all these blessings, our wonderful consciousness, our free will.
[02:13:16.079 --> 02:13:18.840]  Everything good flows out of God that created reality.
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:22.740]  Anyone who has their head screwed on halfway straight feels it, knows it, sees it.
[02:13:23.381 --> 02:13:25.421]  And I've had experiences that are private I won't even get into on air.
[02:13:25.521 --> 02:13:26.281]  It's real, folks.
[02:13:26.321 --> 02:13:27.181]  The enemy knows that.
[02:13:27.781 --> 02:13:32.282]  How could these people not know that Lucifer is the counterfeit?
[02:13:32.402 --> 02:13:34.103]  They believe Christ is the counterfeit.
[02:13:34.663 --> 02:13:39.064]  How do they not, in their very soul, know it as prima facie, Joel?
[02:13:39.984 --> 02:13:41.705]  It doesn't matter if they know it or not.
[02:13:41.925 --> 02:13:43.805]  I mean, Satan knows what's real.
[02:13:43.845 --> 02:13:45.105]  He still fights against it.
[02:13:45.746 --> 02:13:46.426]  That's the point.
[02:13:46.466 --> 02:14:01.570]  When you get a history, a backlog of sin, and one other point I wanted to make, the reason why the gay agenda is so important to this globalist agenda is because part of the lure is to have dirt on people, to control them.
[02:14:02.290 --> 02:14:08.034]  To tell them, look, we've got this and this, so you're going to do what we ask you to do, or we will reveal these things.
[02:14:08.054 --> 02:14:09.355]  And then they get deeper into it.
[02:14:09.415 --> 02:14:14.819]  Once you get deep enough into it, in these kinds of sins, and they love blackmailable sins.
[02:14:15.099 --> 02:14:17.801]  Homosexuality used to be the ultimate blackmailable sin.
[02:14:18.261 --> 02:14:21.624]  It isn't as much today, but it still is significant.
[02:14:22.624 --> 02:14:24.285]  And they use that.
[02:14:25.166 --> 02:14:27.888]  To cause people to say, look, this is your best choice out.
[02:14:28.468 --> 02:14:30.450]  It doesn't matter if you know that hell is coming.
[02:14:30.510 --> 02:14:32.831]  They're promising them immunity from that.
[02:14:32.931 --> 02:14:36.814]  And that's an illusory hope that in fact lures a lot of people in.
[02:14:37.014 --> 02:14:37.634]  It does work.
[02:14:38.935 --> 02:14:40.576]  So they just do it out of fear.
[02:14:42.853 --> 02:15:03.098]  Yeah, fear of the two bad choices, you know, admitting what I'm doing is wrong and taking the consequences, or the promise, the illusory promise that somehow someone's going to give me immunity in there, I can keep going in the same direction I can do, and get rewarded along the way with wine, women, and songs.
[02:15:03.138 --> 02:15:08.600]  Well, there is a thrill in sin at a certain level, but then it always gets really scary down that road.
[02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:17.102]  Again, I'm not up here on some high horse saying, like, you know, the fake church up there acting foolish and attacking everybody, which actually drives folks away.
[02:15:17.462 --> 02:15:25.564]  But clearly, clearly, you know, aborting our children, this whole anti-human agenda, we can see where it leads.
[02:15:25.644 --> 02:15:27.025]  It's just, it's hellish.
[02:15:28.025 --> 02:15:30.326]  It seems to me, hell is almost of its own making.
[02:15:30.366 --> 02:15:45.413]  I know God judges us, but at the same time, to me, hell is just a place where all the bad spirits who resonate towards that go, and that's what makes it hell, is that the parasites, the vampires, don't have a God's creation to feed on.
[02:15:45.733 --> 02:15:48.134]  It's almost like a phantom zone that they're being sent to.
[02:15:48.174 --> 02:15:50.815]  I mean, what is your idea of hell, from a biblical perspective?
[02:15:51.195 --> 02:15:55.618]  Well, I think that there really is extreme suffering in hell.
[02:15:56.578 --> 02:16:02.762]  And, you know, the reason is, it's like you didn't learn the lessons of earth through listening to conscience.
[02:16:03.642 --> 02:16:10.386]  And so you're going to get the extreme pain of consequences all poured onto your mind and it tends to purge out of people.
[02:16:10.466 --> 02:16:16.310]  And God's own mercy tends to purge any desire to do those things again because they remember the pain.
[02:16:17.230 --> 02:16:26.241]  And that's what I think hell does, from a godly standpoint, is help the people purge those evil desires because they experience the full pain.
[02:16:26.361 --> 02:16:37.254]  Remember, the entire concept of satanic-driven government is to exclude people from the pain of their consequences so that they aren't judged, so that they get immunity from things.
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:47.437]  You can see that God needs to give consequences and pain that we might learn if only by at the end of this world through the chains of hell.
[02:16:49.005 --> 02:16:58.813]  Pretty heavy stuff, and whether folks believe in God and the Devil or not, as a group consciousness, it is manifesting, and the world elite do follow Luciferianism.
[02:16:59.573 --> 02:17:00.894]  And then their minions are Satanists.
[02:17:00.995 --> 02:17:01.975]  It's just, it's hardcore.
[02:17:02.356 --> 02:17:03.637]  Chris, you're on the air with Joel Scalza.
[02:17:03.657 --> 02:17:04.157]  Thanks for holding.
[02:17:04.497 --> 02:17:07.680]  Then we'll go to John, Mario, Alex, and Ian.
[02:17:07.700 --> 02:17:08.060]  Go ahead.
[02:17:09.501 --> 02:17:10.562]  Hey, how's it going, Mr. Skelton?
[02:17:11.443 --> 02:17:12.604]  Fine, thank you.
[02:17:13.587 --> 02:17:14.287]  I have a quick question.
[02:17:14.307 --> 02:17:24.590]  I'm a college student here in Liberal California, you know, and a lot of my colleagues, I've noticed, aren't really, you know, that educated, unfortunately.
[02:17:25.251 --> 02:17:28.952]  And I'm not trying to be arrogant or anything, but, you know, the education level here is, like, really dumbed down.
[02:17:30.392 --> 02:17:32.133]  And, you know, it's ridiculous.
[02:17:32.173 --> 02:17:36.594]  I live over here in the midst of what's happening with Jade Helmet and everything, and, you know, it's pretty scary stuff.
[02:17:37.254 --> 02:17:45.220]  But, you know, my question for you is, what do you think about, you know, the whole Edward Snowden revelations and whatnot?
[02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:48.602]  Because my colleagues, when I told them about it, they couldn't care less.
[02:17:48.682 --> 02:17:51.765]  I mean, they don't even know who their governor is, let alone the vice president.
[02:17:52.185 --> 02:17:53.366]  So, what's your opinion on that?
[02:17:54.571 --> 02:18:10.679]  Well, the Ednars Snowden revelations, and I think he's sincere by the way, I think that they're the most significant revelation because it gave the mainstream world at least a glimpse into the fact of this total awareness spying program that the government's been involved in.
[02:18:11.319 --> 02:18:13.640]  And Snowden didn't even know half the picture.
[02:18:13.660 --> 02:18:18.243]  I mean, they've been spying on everyone and everything.
[02:18:18.923 --> 02:18:24.809]  For years, even before 9-11, it's very, very significant and it's a good test for people.
[02:18:25.410 --> 02:18:32.837]  If they aren't concerned with total spying of people, it's because they've been told it's just metadata, that it isn't the content.
[02:18:33.278 --> 02:18:38.122]  Let me tell you, it's impossible to extract the metadata until you have the total content.
[02:18:38.182 --> 02:18:39.023]  They've got it all.
[02:18:39.984 --> 02:18:42.185]  And you have to understand the reason.
[02:18:42.225 --> 02:18:44.426]  The reason is eventually to take down dissidents.
[02:18:44.806 --> 02:18:49.807]  You know it can't be for terrorism because terrorism is mostly a controlled government operation.
[02:18:50.608 --> 02:18:54.329]  So this is a litmus test to me to see if people have a good conscience.
[02:18:54.389 --> 02:18:55.489]  They should be concerned.
[02:18:55.569 --> 02:19:00.111]  If they aren't, I don't really deal with a lot of people who don't sense that something's wrong.
[02:19:00.131 --> 02:19:00.811]  I only
[02:19:02.219 --> 02:19:06.784]  Concentrate my efforts on those that are at least aware enough to sense that something's wrong.
[02:19:06.824 --> 02:19:09.426]  I was about to say Christ said knock the dust off your feet.
[02:19:09.887 --> 02:19:17.714]  It's not that we don't love these people, but when they laugh at us and they show that spirit of contempt, it means they're probably too far gone.
[02:19:17.735 --> 02:19:19.777]  You need to move on to those that are receptive.
[02:19:20.217 --> 02:19:23.941]  That's where you want to plant your seeds is in the good soil where it actually bears fruit.
[02:19:25.885 --> 02:19:26.405]  Definitely.
[02:19:26.445 --> 02:19:33.768]  You know, I have, uh, when I had, I bought my laptop to, uh, when I bought my laptop to school one time, uh, you know, do, uh, do a presentation or whatnot.
[02:19:33.788 --> 02:19:35.689]  People were asking why I had tape on my webcam.
[02:19:36.049 --> 02:19:37.390]  You know, they were ridiculing me for it.
[02:19:38.210 --> 02:19:43.853]  And, I mean, I explained to them why, you know, because of the whole NSA thing, and I told them what was going on and everything, and they couldn't care less.
[02:19:43.973 --> 02:19:46.374]  They used that whole false strawman argument.
[02:19:46.434 --> 02:19:49.835]  Well, sure, they think denying there's a problem controls reality.
[02:19:49.855 --> 02:19:50.775]  They're very childlike.
[02:19:51.016 --> 02:19:52.116]  Joel Skousen's our guest.
[02:19:52.216 --> 02:19:54.137]  Joel, can I push you on for one more segment?
[02:19:55.458 --> 02:19:57.601]  Alright, worldaffairsbrief.com, thanks for doing that.
[02:19:58.222 --> 02:20:01.947]  Thank you caller John, Mario, Alex and others.
[02:20:02.167 --> 02:20:04.370]  We're going to come back and rapid fire go through your calls.
[02:20:04.771 --> 02:20:06.814]  So be ready with your questions or comments straight ahead.
[02:20:07.335 --> 02:20:08.136]  Back in just a few minutes.
[02:20:09.818 --> 02:20:10.999]  You know about RVs.
[02:20:11.199 --> 02:20:12.460]  You've heard about bunkers.
[02:20:12.660 --> 02:20:15.222]  But surviving is not recreation.
[02:20:15.422 --> 02:20:17.964]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[02:20:49.441 --> 02:20:55.543]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[02:23:08.269 --> 02:23:09.990]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[02:23:10.210 --> 02:23:13.532]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[02:23:13.832 --> 02:23:14.813]  A pair of scissors.
[02:23:15.193 --> 02:23:20.696]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[02:23:20.976 --> 02:23:25.658]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[02:23:25.919 --> 02:23:26.719]  The phone line.
[02:23:26.879 --> 02:23:31.802]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[02:23:32.142 --> 02:23:35.884]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[02:23:36.044 --> 02:23:38.927]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[02:24:19.076 --> 02:24:21.057]  Joel Skousen of WorldAffairsBrief.org.
[02:24:21.077 --> 02:24:21.698]  He's the editor there.
[02:24:21.718 --> 02:24:22.118]  He's our guest.
[02:24:22.178 --> 02:24:22.858]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:24:22.999 --> 02:24:24.219]  Let's move quickly through your calls.
[02:24:24.539 --> 02:24:26.281]  John in Texas, you've got a question for Joel.
[02:24:26.301 --> 02:24:26.621]  Go ahead.
[02:24:28.322 --> 02:24:32.224]  Yes, my question is, I'm a black male.
[02:24:32.645 --> 02:24:37.408]  I speak Spanish fluently and I went down and got some property down in Panama.
[02:24:37.808 --> 02:24:42.471]  I like Joel's expert opinion on Panama.
[02:24:42.491 --> 02:24:43.411]  I'm just really concerned.
[02:24:43.451 --> 02:24:44.052]  I love the country.
[02:24:44.072 --> 02:24:47.174]  I'm just concerned about China and Panama with the Panama Canal.
[02:24:48.729 --> 02:24:49.730]  Well, it's a good question.
[02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:50.750]  You ought to be concerned.
[02:24:50.770 --> 02:24:53.892]  I've spent a lot of time in Central America, including Panama.
[02:24:54.733 --> 02:25:09.642]  It's got, you know, perhaps the best banking ability for Americans, even despite the new shutdown of most, a lot of banks in Central America aren't dealing with Americans anymore, but you can get service in Panama.
[02:25:10.822 --> 02:25:15.704]  You've got to remember, though, that Panama is not a principled country.
[02:25:15.744 --> 02:25:18.365]  It'll make a deal with anybody who plans to bail them out.
[02:25:18.405 --> 02:25:21.746]  That's why they made their extensive deals with Red China.
[02:25:22.306 --> 02:25:26.408]  China is intending to take the Panama Canal, and that means occupying the country someday.
[02:25:27.881 --> 02:25:38.273]  What I'm telling you is that all of the expat experience about the nice, cheap, easy living in Latin America, especially Central America, won't hold up during a wartime scenario.
[02:25:38.333 --> 02:25:40.075]  The tourist economy will disappear.
[02:25:40.696 --> 02:25:42.478]  There'll be a constant deficit.
[02:25:42.558 --> 02:25:46.222]  I think they'll confiscate American bank accounts and perhaps American property.
[02:25:47.083 --> 02:26:00.994]  So, I think while you can still have a few years to enjoy that, you ought to make plans to come back and strategically locate in the United States, and you might reference my book on that, but... Absolutely.
[02:26:01.014 --> 02:26:02.075]  Joe, let me ask you a question.
[02:26:03.276 --> 02:26:06.579]  Is there anywhere in the world you think is better than the United States?
[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:09.261]  No, not for Americans especially.
[02:26:09.741 --> 02:26:11.222]  Americans can blend in here.
[02:26:11.242 --> 02:26:28.071]  We're going to lose our liberty as a nation, in my opinion, but there will be pockets, large pockets of resistance, especially out West, where a lot of the good people will migrate after and during war, and there will be majorities, new majorities formed that I think will be able to resist.
[02:26:28.131 --> 02:26:29.872]  I mean, the preppers are the people that see it coming.
[02:26:29.912 --> 02:26:31.012]  Thank you for the great call, John.
[02:26:32.373 --> 02:26:36.495]  And just by the source of our economy and we'll build new little societies.
[02:26:37.135 --> 02:26:38.876]  Let's talk to Alex in Wisconsin.
[02:26:38.896 --> 02:26:39.456]  You're on the air.
[02:26:39.496 --> 02:26:39.856]  Go ahead.
[02:26:41.537 --> 02:26:42.577]  Salutations, Joel.
[02:26:42.717 --> 02:26:44.258]  Alex, I have two questions.
[02:26:44.298 --> 02:26:50.401]  First question from Joel is, I've heard Alex answer this one, but what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole?
[02:26:54.022 --> 02:26:55.863]  And you're talking about the globalist conspiracy?
[02:26:58.037 --> 02:27:04.799]  Uh, well, where does it all end with, you know, is it just satanism as Alex says, or is, uh, you know, where does it all...
[02:27:06.300 --> 02:27:07.581]  Get to the bottom of it, you know?
[02:27:07.701 --> 02:27:08.482]  What's the end game?
[02:27:09.523 --> 02:27:17.429]  Well, you know, the end game is total control without you realizing that you're under total control.
[02:27:17.529 --> 02:27:27.877]  In other words, sufficient crises so that people yield up their sovereignty and their free will and keeping you in constant crisis so that you will continue to do that.
[02:27:28.097 --> 02:27:31.759]  But ultimately, Satan is interested in the corruption of the soul.
[02:27:32.459 --> 02:27:37.763]  It is a satanic agenda, and that's why he's not content only for control.
[02:27:37.843 --> 02:27:39.003]  He wants corruption as well.
[02:27:39.023 --> 02:27:44.847]  That's why he's working on Hollywood, literature, you know, books, movies... You can see the acceleration.
[02:27:44.887 --> 02:27:50.370]  They're now in major newspapers saying pedophilia is not a big deal, and you're basically a pedophobe.
[02:27:50.770 --> 02:27:54.012]  I mean, they're really... there is no bottom of the pit.
[02:27:57.455 --> 02:27:57.995]  Thank you, caller.
[02:27:58.015 --> 02:27:58.695]  Appreciate that.
[02:27:59.095 --> 02:28:00.616]  One last call and I'll come back to other callers.
[02:28:00.656 --> 02:28:01.236]  Joel's got to go.
[02:28:01.536 --> 02:28:03.396]  Mario, you're our telegunner with Joel Scalzen.
[02:28:03.416 --> 02:28:03.716]  Go ahead.
[02:28:05.297 --> 02:28:05.757]  Hi, Alex.
[02:28:05.777 --> 02:28:06.197]  Hi, Joel.
[02:28:06.217 --> 02:28:07.937]  I just want to say I'm a huge fan.
[02:28:08.517 --> 02:28:10.318]  Me and my girlfriend, we're at Cal Jam.
[02:28:10.338 --> 02:28:12.098]  We just love the energy you brought.
[02:28:12.658 --> 02:28:13.578]  People are waking up.
[02:28:13.598 --> 02:28:14.939]  There's no question about that.
[02:28:16.099 --> 02:28:26.221]  Joel, for you, people are waking, you know, to the atrocities that our government are a part of, but some are still worried about questions like conspiracies about inflatable balls in the NFL.
[02:28:27.516 --> 02:28:30.398]  But they don't want to believe that there's evil people in control in the government.
[02:28:30.438 --> 02:28:31.398]  What would you say to that?
[02:28:33.099 --> 02:28:34.780]  Well, that's a big question.
[02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:43.444]  First of all, you've got to remember that there's a lot of phony conspiracy theories put out there specifically to discredit true conspiracies.
[02:28:43.524 --> 02:28:45.405]  Cass Sunstein admitted that White House plan.
[02:28:46.297 --> 02:28:46.477]  Right.
[02:28:46.617 --> 02:28:50.838]  I spent a lot of time in Petersburg debunking what I consider the false conspiracies.
[02:28:51.478 --> 02:28:52.398]  And they're all over the place.
[02:28:52.438 --> 02:28:56.719]  There's a lot of conspiracies talking about imminent nuclear war because of Ukraine.
[02:28:56.799 --> 02:28:57.819]  It's not going to happen.
[02:28:58.239 --> 02:28:59.339]  Russia isn't ready yet.
[02:29:00.219 --> 02:29:09.841]  And they're going to get people tired of who buy into that and run around like a head with their cut off, claiming that nuclear war is imminent.
[02:29:09.881 --> 02:29:14.862]  When it doesn't happen, then when the real threat gets close, nobody will listen.
[02:29:15.162 --> 02:29:21.287]  Well, look at how we never said martial law this summer, that it was training for that, and part of a long-term conditioning.
[02:29:21.548 --> 02:29:23.069]  They never quoted us or linked to us.
[02:29:23.369 --> 02:29:27.693]  They just said, we said imminent, you know, war takeover this summer.
[02:29:27.933 --> 02:29:30.435]  So when it doesn't happen, they'll write articles and say we said that.
[02:29:30.735 --> 02:29:32.277]  So obviously that's their agenda.
[02:29:33.635 --> 02:29:40.560]  And then even in the economy, we've had people, notable people, from Peter Schiff to John... Williams.
[02:29:41.281 --> 02:29:46.465]  Williams, and Gerald Selenny, for the past few years, predicting imminent collapse.
[02:29:46.645 --> 02:29:50.407]  And they don't understand, sure, the economy in the free market, it should collapse.
[02:29:51.008 --> 02:29:56.512]  But they don't understand the power, the powers that be to keep things going, and do not do that.
[02:29:56.532 --> 02:29:57.393]  Joel, we're out of time.
[02:29:57.493 --> 02:29:58.293]  Thank you so much.
[02:29:58.774 --> 02:29:59.694]  We're on the watch.
[02:29:59.894 --> 02:30:00.275]  Joel Scousin.
[02:30:00.295 --> 02:30:01.175]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.195 --> 02:30:01.636]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.672 --> 02:30:05.473]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:32:09.171 --> 02:32:10.812]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:32:11.132 --> 02:32:14.855]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:15.355 --> 02:32:19.678]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:32:19.818 --> 02:32:26.582]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:32:27.122 --> 02:32:33.606]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimism.
[02:32:33.646 --> 02:32:34.046]  I'm good.
[02:32:54.099 --> 02:32:56.780]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:57.621]  It's Alex Jones.

[02:33:28.822 --> 02:33:33.444]  Joel Skousen has left us, but I will continue with Ian, Tony, Roger, Mike, and others' calls.

[02:33:42.049 --> 02:33:48.273]  I want to play a special report that Leanne McAdoo filed on the Hillary Clinton email scandal, because it just shows how they're above the law.
[02:33:49.428 --> 02:33:54.759]  We're going to tie that in to Senator Robert Menendez, indicted on corruption charges, but not Lois Lerner.

[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:13.963]  I had surgery yesterday and I've had a lot of energy until now.
[02:35:14.803 --> 02:35:16.865]  And I am exhausted at this point.
[02:35:19.447 --> 02:35:21.288]  So bear with me, this is teleprompter free.
[02:35:21.928 --> 02:35:23.269]  I have become very sleepy.
[02:35:23.710 --> 02:35:26.652]  I couldn't go to bed until like 1 o'clock last night even though I had surgery yesterday.
[02:35:26.672 --> 02:35:30.555]  And I'm not really taking the pain meds they gave me, I'm taking a half dose.
[02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:34.390]  I don't know, a half dose of the paymentless thing.
[02:35:34.410 --> 02:35:37.011]  I mean, I feel like I've had like two beers, basically.
[02:35:38.372 --> 02:35:41.292]  But it's good to be back.
[02:35:41.552 --> 02:35:42.793]  It is exciting to be on air.
[02:35:43.593 --> 02:35:45.694]  And praise God that the surgery went well.
[02:35:46.114 --> 02:35:47.514]  Now I just won't be too active.
[02:35:47.554 --> 02:35:52.656]  I won't bust any of the internal or external stitches on this hernia surgery I had.
[02:35:52.696 --> 02:35:56.757]  But I tell you, I'm just so excited to be rid of this thing, hopefully, that
[02:35:58.203 --> 02:36:04.185]  The pain is a welcome respite from a piece of intestine sticking out of my stomach.
[02:36:06.306 --> 02:36:19.671]  I want to get to all the news, but again, InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsHealth.com, InfoWarsTeam.com, and of course the big, mega, main umbrella, InfoWarsStore.com, our call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[02:36:20.151 --> 02:36:26.414]  And if you haven't tried the Oxy Powder, one time I called up the nanny and I said,
[02:36:29.779 --> 02:36:34.223]  Remind me to give the neighbors some oxy powder.
[02:36:34.243 --> 02:36:35.143]  They were asking for it.
[02:36:35.483 --> 02:36:36.844]  I'm bringing some home today.
[02:36:37.285 --> 02:36:40.927]  If you see the neighbor, because my kids play with their kids, you give them a bottle of oxy powder.
[02:36:42.389 --> 02:36:46.552]  She goes, Alex, I didn't, are you supposed to give people oxy cotton?
[02:36:50.054 --> 02:36:52.696]  And I said, I've never taken oxy cotton.
[02:36:52.836 --> 02:36:55.038]  I said, it's oxy powder.
[02:36:56.311 --> 02:36:59.692]  There is a case of it that I'm bringing home.
[02:37:00.092 --> 02:37:01.232]  Give the neighbors some.
[02:37:02.012 --> 02:37:05.613]  Oxy powder, a higher form of oxygen.
[02:37:06.194 --> 02:37:07.494]  All the science is on the website.
[02:37:07.874 --> 02:37:08.574]  It's time released.
[02:37:08.634 --> 02:37:09.874]  It's been out for 15 years.
[02:37:10.495 --> 02:37:11.695]  People in Hollywood take it.
[02:37:11.775 --> 02:37:13.395]  We have it discounted directly from Dr. Groob.
[02:37:13.595 --> 02:37:15.036]  It's the only thing we sell it in force.
[02:37:15.916 --> 02:37:17.958]  Life.com, this is something that's proprietary to us.
[02:37:18.018 --> 02:37:21.160]  It's so good, we sell it at the same price or a dollar lower than he does.
[02:37:21.521 --> 02:37:23.762]  There's about three different rounds of it, about three months of it.
[02:37:24.103 --> 02:37:30.708]  He's just taking it for like, what I do is I take it for six days, once a month, and you'll lose, well do lose 12 pounds in one week.
[02:37:31.408 --> 02:37:35.091]  He was already skinny, not fat, he had a tiny potbelly, wasn't fat.
[02:37:35.732 --> 02:37:37.073]  He had a six pack, but it pooched out.
[02:37:37.133 --> 02:37:39.054]  That was 12 pounds of crap.
[02:37:39.495 --> 02:37:43.138]  Excuse my French, but 12 pounds of detritus and just, it was unbelievable.
[02:37:44.164 --> 02:37:44.424]  He went up
[02:38:07.236 --> 02:38:13.397]  For a six day run and forgot to do it again, that I'd already lost so much weight that I took the photo last Friday, we're going to put on an ad soon.
[02:38:13.417 --> 02:38:21.179]  So even though I didn't even fully do it, I didn't fully follow everything I said I would, I still increased the amount of supplements because I'm always forgetting.
[02:38:21.599 --> 02:38:27.000]  And I went from maybe doing my supplements religiously three days a week to about five days a week and lost even more weight.
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:28.280]  So it's just amazing.
[02:38:28.660 --> 02:38:30.701]  And if you can just make yourself use it,
[02:38:31.758 --> 02:38:39.983]  The iodine and the oxy powder and the secret 12 and the vitamin D3, winter sun, and just all of it, it's life-changing.
[02:38:40.103 --> 02:38:41.804]  All of it synergistically together.
[02:38:42.284 --> 02:38:46.146]  But the biggest step to change your life is the iodine and the oxy powder.
[02:38:46.546 --> 02:38:48.107]  Those two things, try those.
[02:38:48.647 --> 02:38:53.030]  If they don't blow you away, you've supported the broadcast, you've heard the rave reviews, and then
[02:38:54.611 --> 02:38:59.395]  I believe it will help you, 99% it does, and then you'll try the other products and it's a win-win-win.
[02:38:59.675 --> 02:39:00.736]  We fund this operation.
[02:39:01.116 --> 02:39:07.782]  You put fuel into the tank for us to take off the ground and go over the enemy territory and bomb the living daylights out of them with info bombs.
[02:39:08.502 --> 02:39:13.046]  Let's go to this report by Leon McAdoo, then back to your calls, and then a news blitz straight ahead.
[02:39:13.066 --> 02:39:13.847]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:39:22.817 --> 02:39:25.479]  This is the heart of 1776, did you know that?
[02:39:27.381 --> 02:39:29.702]  There are four things I want the public to know.
[02:39:30.483 --> 02:39:48.957]  First, when I got to work as Secretary of State, I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.
[02:39:49.577 --> 02:39:49.817]  Nope.
[02:39:50.118 --> 02:39:52.440]  Turns out that first statement is a lie.
[02:39:52.660 --> 02:39:56.804]  Not only did just weeks earlier Clinton admit to using two phones.
[02:39:57.084 --> 02:39:58.045]  The big question.
[02:39:58.346 --> 02:39:58.766]  Okay.
[02:40:00.648 --> 02:40:02.069]  iPhone or Android?
[02:40:04.472 --> 02:40:04.852]  iPhone.
[02:40:08.035 --> 02:40:09.657]  Okay, in full disclosure?
[02:40:09.977 --> 02:40:10.498]  Blackberry.
[02:40:11.138 --> 02:40:11.779]  And a Blackberry.
[02:40:13.168 --> 02:40:20.730]  The Associated Press obtained State Department documents showing Clinton emailed her staff on an iPad as well.
[02:40:21.150 --> 02:40:24.390]  And obviously an iPad is a lot bigger than a second phone.
[02:40:24.750 --> 02:40:30.572]  So Hillary Clinton's excuse that she needed this for convenience shouldn't trump national security.
[02:40:31.332 --> 02:40:41.494]  Now not only do we see Clinton mixing personal and work chats, here she responds to an email update on drone strikes with some interior decorating questions.
[02:40:41.914 --> 02:40:45.797]  Plus, it seems like she can't seem to figure out how to use her iPad.
[02:40:46.337 --> 02:40:47.078]  Seems confident.
[02:40:47.318 --> 02:40:48.379]  Let's make her president.
[02:40:48.839 --> 02:40:57.006]  Second, the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses.
[02:40:57.406 --> 02:41:05.672]  You'll recall that it was actually the hacker, Guccifer, who revealed Clinton's private email address and the fact that she seemed to be running her own secret spy network.
[02:41:05.892 --> 02:41:09.314]  Three men were involved in her private intelligence gathering efforts.
[02:41:09.594 --> 02:41:13.096]  They were feeding her intel on, among other things, Benghazi.
[02:41:13.577 --> 02:41:16.118]  What difference at this point does it make?
[02:41:16.319 --> 02:41:22.483]  Now the State Department pledged that they turned over all documents pertaining to the Benghazi investigation.
[02:41:23.203 --> 02:41:31.432]  We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work-related emails and deliver them to the State Department.
[02:41:32.374 --> 02:41:36.999]  At the end, I chose not to keep my private, personal emails.
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:42.603]  She basically told the Congressional investigators what they could do with their letters and with their subpoenas.
[02:41:42.623 --> 02:41:44.224]  She could have taught Richard Nixon a lesson.
[02:42:07.259 --> 02:42:10.700]  So it's definitely not looking good for Hillary that she wiped her server.
[02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:17.962]  But then again, we are talking about a woman who was fired from the Watergate investigation for being unethical.
[02:42:18.643 --> 02:42:19.703]  Are you ready for Hillary?
[02:42:19.723 --> 02:42:25.405]  You know the old joke, how do you know Hillary Clinton's lying?
[02:42:25.445 --> 02:42:26.065]  She's breathing.
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:29.881]  I mean, the woman is just a complete lie.
[02:42:30.581 --> 02:42:35.263]  It violates the Open Records Act that's part of the National Security Act of 1947.
[02:42:36.903 --> 02:42:42.445]  But across the board, the federal government is in a revolution against the law and not responding to four years, you name it.
[02:42:43.526 --> 02:42:48.728]  She used unrestricted, unprotected, it violates national security laws, felony.
[02:42:50.328 --> 02:42:52.669]  Petraeus just did a plea bargain.
[02:42:52.689 --> 02:42:54.370]  People are going to jail for this, okay?
[02:42:55.452 --> 02:42:56.353]  There's so many crimes.
[02:42:56.373 --> 02:43:04.518]  A, she absconded, used faked emails, used pen names, did official business secretly, has been caught lying, violated Open Records Act.
[02:43:05.099 --> 02:43:05.779]  We need a report.
[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:07.460]  Hillary caught red-handed.
[02:43:07.541 --> 02:43:07.841]  Proof.
[02:43:08.541 --> 02:43:10.323]  Proof Hillary Clinton is a criminal for emails.
[02:43:10.763 --> 02:43:11.583]  I mean, just show it!
[02:43:12.304 --> 02:43:16.807]  They had press conferences admitting a gun-running program, Fast and Furious, before it ever even came out.
[02:43:17.087 --> 02:43:18.929]  They said, we're running this, and they said they never heard about it.
[02:43:19.289 --> 02:43:23.152]  And it was Big Sis and Holder and all of them up there on TV.
[02:43:24.451 --> 02:43:26.293]  And no media picked that up but us that I know of.
[02:43:27.014 --> 02:43:27.935]  I mean, it's a joke.
[02:43:28.856 --> 02:43:34.082]  But again, her brainwashing is targeting people that live in the Twilight Zone.
[02:43:35.803 --> 02:43:38.727]  Now, I want to go to your phone calls, but let me hit some of these news items here.
[02:43:39.628 --> 02:43:42.251]  Senator Robert Menendez indicted on corruption charges.
[02:43:44.023 --> 02:43:47.967]  For $750,000 in campaign donations and lavish vacations.
[02:43:48.007 --> 02:43:50.690]  I mean, this is something almost all of them do.
[02:43:51.371 --> 02:43:57.817]  He's a horrible globalist anti-gun, slimy guy with a lot of other dirt, but you notice this is all this internal fight.
[02:43:57.857 --> 02:44:02.101]  He's backing Israel, and then Obama isn't.
[02:44:02.502 --> 02:44:06.185]  I mean, I thought this was all fake, but starting to indict people over stuff.
[02:44:07.225 --> 02:44:07.525]  I don't know.
[02:44:07.545 --> 02:44:10.766]  Medendez charges put Iran legislation in doubt.
[02:44:11.146 --> 02:44:15.427]  Hillary Clinton makes it hard to follow the money of the Atlantic.
[02:44:16.628 --> 02:44:20.068]  State Department found four emails about drones sent by Clinton.
[02:44:20.108 --> 02:44:22.449]  Yeah, first she said it was official business, then it wasn't.
[02:44:22.809 --> 02:44:29.951]  As if, as if the State Department can, quote, authorize her and then it's okay.
[02:44:29.991 --> 02:44:33.352]  Well, Obama just authorizes opening the borders up outside of law.
[02:44:35.720 --> 02:44:45.936]  Continuing, Garcia running against Emmanuel, blasts the rise in murders and shootings, but he's anti-gun too, so it's again two peas in a pod.
[02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:49.863]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[02:44:52.878 --> 02:44:53.278]  D.C.
[02:44:53.318 --> 02:44:55.639]  gives up ban on carrying guns in public.
[02:44:56.179 --> 02:44:56.799]  Washington, D.C.
[02:44:56.839 --> 02:45:01.140]  will drop its appeal to a federal court ruling that overturned the city's ban on carrying handguns in public.
[02:45:01.460 --> 02:45:04.181]  Attorney General Carl Racey announced Wednesday.
[02:45:04.201 --> 02:45:06.881]  So good news there, but they're still six years after D.C.
[02:45:07.242 --> 02:45:09.062]  and Heller haven't fully backed off.
[02:45:11.643 --> 02:45:12.643]  But we are on the march.
[02:45:13.343 --> 02:45:16.844]  The empire is on the run, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:45:18.357 --> 02:45:23.902]  Continuing, former Blackwater gets rich as Afghan drug production hits record high.
[02:45:24.303 --> 02:45:29.267]  They were paid $569 million to quote eradicate it, and then production went up 13-fold.
[02:45:29.667 --> 02:45:30.668]  Yeah, it's on Fox News.
[02:45:30.708 --> 02:45:33.191]  They load the drugs on the C-130s and fly them here.
[02:45:33.511 --> 02:45:35.753]  When your kid, your teenager gets caught with it, they go to prison.
[02:45:37.915 --> 02:45:40.537]  After Snowden, the NSA faces recruitment challenge.
[02:45:40.917 --> 02:45:43.460]  Folks don't want to join the NSA because they see it as criminal.
[02:45:45.390 --> 02:45:48.013]  In a way, that's bad though, because then only bad people will want to join it.
[02:45:48.794 --> 02:45:50.476]  I mentioned this, but I wanted to cover it now.
[02:45:50.896 --> 02:45:54.500]  The university requires students to apply for free speech permits.
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:55.321]  How liberal!
[02:45:55.821 --> 02:46:00.827]  You have to get pre-approved what your speech is at Polytechnic in California, in Pomona.
[02:46:03.393 --> 02:46:12.080]  Joe Biggs wants to go to California and cover the water shortage and get into geoengineering and how Nesty and others have a monopoly on the water and don't have to pay for it.
[02:46:13.001 --> 02:46:18.125]  Yeah, he might want to drop by this university too and hand out flyers and have them on tape saying you can't do that.
[02:46:18.886 --> 02:46:21.708]  This is the type of, there's been a bunch where you can't hand out constitutions.
[02:46:22.569 --> 02:46:26.051]  I mean, you can go to communist China and go to a university and hand out constitutions.
[02:46:27.953 --> 02:46:30.335]  You just can't hand stuff out criticizing the communist government.
[02:46:31.476 --> 02:46:32.016]  And that's bad.
[02:46:32.257 --> 02:46:34.338]  I mean, these are not liberals.
[02:46:34.378 --> 02:46:35.379]  These are authoritarians.
[02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:38.262]  And this is what's being taught.
[02:46:38.282 --> 02:46:42.626]  That's why we have to engage in our free speech or lose it.
[02:46:43.086 --> 02:46:49.511]  Everyone at that university should go out and everyone at once should hand out flyers of whatever they want.
[02:46:50.532 --> 02:46:52.334]  Of just gibberish, just to make the point.
[02:46:53.541 --> 02:46:57.343]  You know, put a monkey in a typewriter, have it type up whatever, literally, that'd be a great stunt.
[02:46:57.363 --> 02:46:58.344]  Here, monkey, here's a typewriter.
[02:46:58.624 --> 02:46:59.885]  We'll give you the banana, just type.
[02:47:00.125 --> 02:47:02.167]  Monkey goes crazy, types gibberish, hand that out.
[02:47:02.267 --> 02:47:04.288]  Oh, sorry, we've got to pre-approve this.
[02:47:06.329 --> 02:47:10.872]  I mean, that is just... Nazi Germany didn't do that.
[02:47:11.472 --> 02:47:13.534]  Just if you put something out they didn't like, they might come after you.
[02:47:13.594 --> 02:47:15.415]  I mean, this is North Korea level.
[02:47:16.636 --> 02:47:22.940]  And it's going on at our liberal universities, where you pay for a degree that's gonna be worth less than Bird's Cage Liner.
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:26.262]  Simply amazing.
[02:47:26.642 --> 02:47:28.563]  Oh, Liberal France banning cash.
[02:47:28.704 --> 02:47:29.424]  Oh, it's so liberal.
[02:47:29.825 --> 02:47:30.625]  Zero Hedge.
[02:47:31.766 --> 02:47:32.827]  Couple NSA stories.
[02:47:33.067 --> 02:47:35.349]  How big business is helping expand NSA surveillance.
[02:47:35.689 --> 02:47:36.530]  Snowden be damned.
[02:47:36.870 --> 02:47:37.971]  And it gets into big business.
[02:47:38.111 --> 02:47:38.752]  All the big ones.
[02:47:38.792 --> 02:47:42.515]  Google, Microsoft, Amazon.
[02:47:43.056 --> 02:47:43.956]  All helping work.
[02:47:44.277 --> 02:47:45.298]  Get the data and share it.
[02:47:45.598 --> 02:47:47.239]  Oh yeah, it's a race to get all this.
[02:47:47.680 --> 02:47:49.221]  It's a revolution against freedom.
[02:47:50.062 --> 02:47:50.342]  Suit.
[02:47:50.382 --> 02:47:51.203]  Facebook faces
[02:47:52.185 --> 02:47:54.426]  Facial recognition technology suit.
[02:47:54.807 --> 02:47:56.628]  They say it violates Illinois' privacy laws.
[02:47:56.648 --> 02:47:56.808]  Yeah.
[02:47:57.168 --> 02:48:04.212]  You walk by these kiosks they've got in Illinois and Texas and New York and all over the place, and it face scans off a database.
[02:48:04.272 --> 02:48:08.175]  Even if you didn't do it, Facebook goes and grabs your face off LinkedIn or...
[02:48:08.835 --> 02:48:16.127]  Off, when you were on TV, off the DMV, and then it checks it in the DMV database, and then now flashes ads at you.
[02:48:16.147 --> 02:48:19.913]  Remember 15 years ago, whatever, Minority Report came out with Tom Cruise?
[02:48:20.273 --> 02:48:22.457]  I said, folks, they already have that in Japan.
[02:48:23.138 --> 02:48:23.899]  They did already have it.
[02:48:27.935 --> 02:48:28.816]  Again, more on this.
[02:48:28.876 --> 02:48:31.318]  House members target Patriot Act with surveillance state repeal act.
[02:48:31.678 --> 02:48:32.338]  Very exciting.
[02:48:33.079 --> 02:48:33.780]  That's going on.
[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:35.001]  Another report here.
[02:48:35.781 --> 02:48:39.684]  Monsanto donates money to save the same butterflies they're killing.
[02:48:40.305 --> 02:48:42.927]  The Monarch butterfly along with honeybees is declining massively.
[02:48:43.507 --> 02:48:49.711]  And it's been linked directly in studies to a 90% reduction in them to Roundup and Glyphosate.
[02:48:50.311 --> 02:48:58.656]  But don't worry, Monsanto is giving $4 million to fight it to fund their own research to probably claim Keebler elves or Easter bunnies did it.
[02:49:01.201 --> 02:49:01.461]  U.S.
[02:49:01.481 --> 02:49:05.022]  Defense Secretary, we might bomb Iran even if a peace agreement is signed.
[02:49:05.482 --> 02:49:07.563]  We want peace, but the military complex wants war.
[02:49:08.143 --> 02:49:09.563]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:49:10.144 --> 02:49:12.664]  Oh, look at this little snibblet.
[02:49:13.525 --> 02:49:18.686]  UK, all babies should receive meningitis vaccine despite package insert warnings.
[02:49:19.366 --> 02:49:24.888]  Safety and effectiveness of Bexsero have not been established in children younger than 10 years of age.
[02:49:25.268 --> 02:49:28.369]  Vaccine insert states, has a lot of serious problems.
[02:49:31.263 --> 02:49:38.125]  Meanwhile, police, black men who beat up train passenger for Mike Brown not charged with hate crime.
[02:49:38.145 --> 02:49:42.446]  So if black folks go out and beat up white folks in racial attacks, they're not charged with hate crimes.
[02:49:42.466 --> 02:49:44.426]  Again, they don't need to be charged with hate crimes.
[02:49:44.466 --> 02:49:45.347]  Charged with regular crime.
[02:49:45.387 --> 02:49:50.148]  The cops are saying that, but it's like the guys that drugged that black man to death in Jasper a decade ago.
[02:49:50.668 --> 02:49:52.949]  They made a big thing in the media saying they were not charged.
[02:49:53.089 --> 02:49:55.009]  Yeah, they were given the death penalty.
[02:49:55.809 --> 02:49:57.990]  They weren't charged with a hate crime because it wasn't applicable.
[02:49:58.712 --> 02:50:03.273]  There was no hate crime legislation, but they ran a hoax on the news going, they murdered him and no hate crime.
[02:50:03.753 --> 02:50:05.694]  But they would never mention on the news they were given the death penalty.
[02:50:05.714 --> 02:50:12.776]  We're going to go to break, come back and talk to Ian, Tony, Roger, Mike and others.
[02:50:12.796 --> 02:50:18.357]  We'll have to go into overdrive and get to everybody, but we will get to everyone straight ahead.
[02:50:18.397 --> 02:50:21.778]  I'm Alex Jones, back from my hernia surgery.
[02:50:22.078 --> 02:50:22.599]  Praise God.
[02:50:25.390 --> 02:50:27.837]  It was hurting so bad already from having it 14 years.
[02:50:27.877 --> 02:50:28.679]  It really got in bed.
[02:50:28.699 --> 02:50:29.923]  I feel like I normally did.
[02:50:30.304 --> 02:50:31.487]  So the pain I'm going through is nothing.
[02:50:31.949 --> 02:50:32.711]  Thanks for your prayers.
[02:50:35.691 --> 02:50:37.412]  Very, very exciting to be getting better.
[02:50:37.433 --> 02:50:39.795]  Again, it's the best of times, worst of times.
[02:50:40.115 --> 02:50:46.040]  Mainline medical science has a lot of good things in it, but it's the globalists influencing it with Obamacare to take it over that's so bad.
[02:50:46.520 --> 02:50:49.483]  There's good in the world, there's bad in the world acting in parallel.
[02:50:50.184 --> 02:50:55.488]  We have to recognize that and use our free will to change the world by our choices.
[02:50:55.808 --> 02:50:58.631]  I know that's elementary, but I want to just keep restating it.
[02:51:00.307 --> 02:51:03.610]  Look what you can do telling friends and family and others about the show.
[02:51:03.790 --> 02:51:06.572]  You're doing it, we're exploding, and the enemy's taking notice.
[02:51:06.592 --> 02:51:06.992]  We'll be back.
[02:51:10.135 --> 02:51:14.478]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[02:51:14.598 --> 02:51:19.322]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[02:51:19.442 --> 02:51:26.908]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease, and a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[02:51:27.148 --> 02:51:29.691]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[02:51:29.811 --> 02:51:34.255]  I've taken whey protein products for years, and I've never noticed results I have with your product.
[02:51:34.275 --> 02:51:37.258]  I've suffered without constipation most of my life.
[02:51:37.478 --> 02:51:41.322]  Within a few days of taking One World Whey, I noticed a dramatic change.
[02:51:41.782 --> 02:51:45.506]  Also, in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[02:51:45.706 --> 02:51:49.170]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar, and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[02:51:49.770 --> 02:51:50.130]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:51:50.190 --> 02:51:50.650]  That's 888-988-3325.

[02:53:09.873 --> 02:53:18.677]  As the New World Order continues to tighten its grip on every facet of our lives, we're all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?
[02:53:19.477 --> 02:53:20.577]  The answer is clear.
[02:53:21.038 --> 02:53:23.038]  Get prepared and you get prepared now.
[02:53:23.639 --> 02:53:26.180]  Now the only question left is where do we begin?
[02:53:27.080 --> 02:53:28.902]  My Patriot Supply is here to help.

[02:53:59.266 --> 02:53:59.586]  Call right now!
[02:54:14.770 --> 02:54:15.690]  Alright, we gotta move quick.
[02:54:15.871 --> 02:54:17.271]  Ian in Florida, thanks for calling.
[02:54:17.291 --> 02:54:18.092]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:54:19.612 --> 02:54:20.653]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:54:20.953 --> 02:54:21.433]  Alright, brother.
[02:54:22.674 --> 02:54:24.255]  Hey, just want to put some pieces together.
[02:54:24.295 --> 02:54:31.678]  You told one of your callers I saw last week that chemtrails are being used to dry California out, essentially.
[02:54:31.718 --> 02:54:39.602]  I've talked to meteorologists and the geoengineering going on off the coast is to block water coming in and raining down and getting over the mountains.
[02:54:39.622 --> 02:54:42.584]  Yes, there's clearly weather warfare going on.
[02:54:43.988 --> 02:54:45.209]  Well, it may be more than that.
[02:54:45.229 --> 02:54:50.592]  It's actually drying the state out so much that it's actually geologically increasing in elevation.
[02:54:50.613 --> 02:54:54.575]  Have you read the reports on that?
[02:54:55.396 --> 02:54:56.036]  No, I've not.
[02:54:56.316 --> 02:55:00.199]  I mean, I know that there are a lot of formations around the country that are rising right now.
[02:55:00.219 --> 02:55:02.060]  I know Yellowstone is rising.
[02:55:02.120 --> 02:55:03.862]  The Supercaldera is due to erupt.
[02:55:04.262 --> 02:55:07.604]  Now, in the scheme of time, due to erupt the next thousand years.
[02:55:08.164 --> 02:55:10.286]  But they some say could be imminent.
[02:55:11.493 --> 02:55:18.008]  When you decrease the pressure on magma or lava, it increases or it changes its physical characteristics.
[02:55:18.630 --> 02:55:26.356]  Now, when you decrease the pressure, it causes the lava to be more fluid, so they may be trying to... Sure.
[02:55:26.796 --> 02:55:34.622]  I'm not a hydrologist or a volcanologist or a seismologist, but I do in general study that, and there's just a lot of earth changes going on.
[02:55:35.022 --> 02:55:36.744]  Why don't you do a video on a report?
[02:55:36.804 --> 02:55:37.684]  We ought to look into that.
[02:55:37.724 --> 02:55:38.385]  Thank you so much.
[02:55:38.845 --> 02:55:40.947]  I want to get some more seismologists and others on.
[02:55:41.547 --> 02:55:44.129]  Let's talk to Mike in Pennsylvania.
[02:55:44.149 --> 02:55:44.670]  You're on the air.
[02:55:44.690 --> 02:55:45.070]  Go ahead.
[02:55:46.251 --> 02:55:47.191]  Thanks for taking the call, Alex.
[02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:51.262]  There's so much going on up here, I'll try to break it down as succinctly as possible.
[02:55:51.282 --> 02:56:00.509]  Attorney General Kathleen Kaine, which is a typical run-of-the-mill Social Climate Democrat, actually in this case is the good guy, and I can't even believe I'm saying that.
[02:56:00.850 --> 02:56:08.095]  What we have up here, if you'll remember, is the Jerry Sandusky child rape case, which was connected to Penn State.
[02:56:08.656 --> 02:56:11.378]  Absolutely, it's a giant pedophile command bench, yes.
[02:56:12.321 --> 02:56:12.601]  Yes.
[02:56:12.902 --> 02:56:22.831]  Okay, well, the Attorney General that took over from the Attorney General that was in charge when that case broke, her name is Kathleen Kane, and we had up here back in the fall what was called Porngate.
[02:56:23.251 --> 02:56:30.277]  And it basically was, at the time, floated in the media as government officials sharing porn on government computers.
[02:56:30.417 --> 02:56:31.919]  But then what ended up happening was,
[02:56:32.606 --> 02:56:42.754]  A man named Supreme Court Justice Seamus McCaffrey, a 33rd degree Freemason, was brought down and had to resign in disgrace because of this.
[02:56:42.994 --> 02:56:51.180]  And then the infighting between Kathleen Kaine and... Sure, I remember seeing this in the news, but I'm not in Pennsylvania like you are, Pennsylvania.
[02:56:51.860 --> 02:56:53.722]  Tell me exactly what you think is going on.
[02:56:54.605 --> 02:56:55.786]  We gotta help her.
[02:56:55.806 --> 02:56:58.468]  She went to CNN, stupidly, as a Democrat.
[02:56:58.488 --> 02:57:03.573]  She went to CNN and said that there was child pornography in the emails between the government officials.
[02:57:04.373 --> 02:57:07.436]  And, unfortunately, those of us who are awake didn't pick it up.
[02:57:07.776 --> 02:57:08.957]  It's my fault I didn't pick it up.
[02:57:09.017 --> 02:57:09.978]  Okay, it's okay.
[02:57:10.038 --> 02:57:10.519]  What happened?
[02:57:11.753 --> 02:57:19.601]  She is now being taken down by a district attorney in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, whose husband is... We'll look into it.
[02:57:19.842 --> 02:57:25.788]  You should put it all... Again, everybody needs to... When you're in an area, write an article or do a YouTube condensing it all together.
[02:57:25.808 --> 02:57:28.891]  I want to hear more, but we got to jump to at least one more caller here.
[02:57:29.331 --> 02:57:30.433]  Roger in Ohio.
[02:57:30.493 --> 02:57:31.494]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:57:32.625 --> 02:57:33.045]  Thank you.
[02:57:33.065 --> 02:57:38.171]  I have been one of the people that have prayed for you also.
[02:57:38.191 --> 02:57:39.372]  Thank you.
[02:57:39.792 --> 02:57:44.918]  And the other thing I wanted to... I have also thanked the Lord that things went well for you.
[02:57:44.938 --> 02:57:49.743]  I think we always ask, but we never thank, and we need to thank.
[02:57:50.724 --> 02:58:04.698]  The point that I wanted to ask Joel was, I was told by a son of a retired nuclear physicist that an EMP is only temporary and it doesn't really knock out everything.
[02:58:05.159 --> 02:58:08.162]  I mean, it knocks it out temporarily, but everything comes back.
[02:58:08.522 --> 02:58:10.963]  Well, some stuff conks out, some stuff gets fried.
[02:58:11.363 --> 02:58:13.364]  But I do think EMP gets overplayed.
[02:58:13.424 --> 02:58:14.624]  Some, man-made.
[02:58:14.765 --> 02:58:22.888]  I don't think a Carrington event, a mass coronal ejection that hits the Earth, will blow out large portions of the satellites and ground systems.
[02:58:23.288 --> 02:58:24.769]  Undoubtedly, I think that's the real threat.
[02:58:25.069 --> 02:58:28.170]  The stuff about Iran and North Korea knocking us out, that is ridiculous.
[02:58:30.033 --> 02:58:40.657]  Um, the other thing, Gog and Magog go into Israel, and if that is the case, then I don't think the elites are, you know, we're not here.
[02:58:41.757 --> 02:58:46.079]  And I see the grid going down, and... I hear ya, I hear ya.
[02:58:46.979 --> 02:58:49.320]  All hell's breaking loose, the elite are digging in, it's crazy times.
[02:58:49.380 --> 02:58:51.220]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock central.

[02:58:53.081 --> 02:58:55.542]  Thank you, God, for all your blessings in the midst of this.
[02:58:55.562 --> 02:58:58.103]  I mean, you've made us a place amongst our enemies.
[02:58:58.123 --> 02:58:58.463]  Thank you.
