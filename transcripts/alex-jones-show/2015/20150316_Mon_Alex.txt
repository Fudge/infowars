[00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.962]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:15.965]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:17.645]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.406 --> 00:00:19.486]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.146 --> 00:00:20.966]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.726 --> 00:00:22.606]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.286 --> 00:00:26.887]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:31.568]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.550]  Can't have it!
[00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:53.627]  A true political prisoner is going to be trying to join us from the lockup today.
[00:00:55.167 --> 00:01:10.593]  And I've seen the political authoritarians that masquerade as the left in this country celebrating the fact that he's in prison for having a tax-exempt, creation-based,
[00:01:12.253 --> 00:01:12.814]  Museum.
[00:01:13.175 --> 00:01:15.358]  I interviewed this guy probably 15 years ago.
[00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:16.761]  He's very nice.
[00:01:16.901 --> 00:01:19.846]  He had best-selling DVDs and VHS tapes for that.
[00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:20.867]  Wrote books.
[00:01:22.253 --> 00:01:27.355]  He's just a very nice, friendly person, and then when you watch the news, they go, it's incredible!
[00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:30.136]  The judge says he's worse than a rapist!
[00:01:30.536 --> 00:01:38.138]  He dared to be tax-exempt and run this scam operation claiming that dinosaurs were on the earth 6,000 years ago.
[00:01:38.858 --> 00:01:41.419]  Well, whether you believe that or not, dinosaurs are here today.
[00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.101]  What do you think Galapagos turtles are, and crocodiles, and alligators, and Komodo dragons, but separately.
[00:01:48.604 --> 00:01:52.367]  I don't agree that Tyrannosaurus Rex was on the planet 6,000 years ago.
[00:01:52.827 --> 00:01:54.428]  I don't totally agree with his worldview.
[00:01:54.989 --> 00:02:01.533]  I don't agree with mainline Darwinism either, that's really just eugenics and the religion of the globalists.
[00:02:01.553 --> 00:02:02.054]  But here's the deal.
[00:02:02.314 --> 00:02:03.294]  You got a First Amendment.
[00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:09.899]  I can go get a 501c3 and start a flying saucer cult like Ray Al if I want to.
[00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:14.222]  Or I can go become an ordained Baptist preacher and get a 501c3 if I want to.
[00:02:16.772 --> 00:02:17.953]  Or be a lay preacher and do it.
[00:02:18.413 --> 00:02:38.846]  When you know the law and you follow this trial, then it takes you down the rabbit hole of the tens of thousands of churches and 501c3s and patriot groups and conservative groups and veterans groups and gun groups that have been harassed, indicted, investigated by the Obama White House and the IRS and the Justice Department.
[00:02:41.087 --> 00:02:43.869]  His creation speaker, Dr. Kent Hovind,
[00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:51.141]  He spent nearly a decade in federal prison, charged with 100 years for mail fraud before his release.
[00:02:54.805 --> 00:02:57.227]  And I guess they've got him back in the system.
[00:02:57.387 --> 00:02:58.589]  We're going to get an update.
[00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.513]  We're going to get all the facts coming up here today.
[00:03:03.373 --> 00:03:08.659]  But they call everything wire fraud because he was trying to get out of prison and talking to his lawyers.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.300]  They're claiming that's wire fraud.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.222]  In fact, the FBI can claim if you ever bounced a check that that's wire fraud and put you in prison.
[00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:18.063]  That's what they did with Lyndon LaRouche.
[00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:21.904]  You can say what you want about Lyndon LaRouche, they always just say, kook, Lyndon LaRouche, on the news.
[00:03:22.124 --> 00:03:24.264]  People don't know who he is, they just know the word kook.
[00:03:25.085 --> 00:03:32.007]  Yeah, he just used to give secret briefings every week to Ronald Reagan and he would fly his own helicopter to CIA headquarters.
[00:03:32.287 --> 00:03:35.168]  That was in the Washington Post before they set him up for wire fraud.
[00:03:35.868 --> 00:03:39.430]  Because they had some chargebacks on credit cards for their magazines.
[00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:44.013]  Anybody that runs an online or mail-order business at the time has those.
[00:03:44.054 --> 00:03:47.376]  I mean, I'm just telling you, this is the totalitarianism in this country.
[00:03:49.157 --> 00:03:52.099]  FreeKentHovind.com is the website.
[00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:54.240]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:59.384]  And we have Mark Adams, who works with former Congressman Hanson.
[00:04:00.916 --> 00:04:09.340]  Who was jailed and tortured by the IRS, found not guilty repeatedly, but they kept arresting him and then torturing him until his feet exploded.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.322]  They do that by chaining you up in an upright position for weeks on end.
[00:04:14.182 --> 00:04:15.222]  They call it de-celling.
[00:04:17.984 --> 00:04:22.886]  He basically is writing a book for Congressman Hanson, who I interviewed many years ago, but is too ill to come on.
[00:04:24.927 --> 00:04:29.689]  He's going to come on and tell us the story of Kent Hovind before he joins us.
[00:04:32.346 --> 00:04:34.287]  But this could happen to anybody.
[00:04:34.427 --> 00:04:42.733]  And, I mean, I don't even follow mainstream TV a lot, but, I mean, HBO, MSNBC, I've seen the pieces where they go, look at this kook.
[00:04:43.034 --> 00:04:46.996]  He had a dinosaur park, telling kids that dinosaurs were around the age of humans.
[00:04:47.337 --> 00:04:48.618]  He deserves to be in prison.
[00:04:48.658 --> 00:04:50.699]  He was tax exempt to run his scam.
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.964]  I mean, you can have a 501c3 and be Hopi Indians out in the West taking drugs.
[00:04:58.124 --> 00:04:58.625]  That's legal.
[00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:03.705]  There's a Christian who believes that the official story of evolution isn't true.
[00:05:04.146 --> 00:05:05.487]  And it's been proven to be a fraud.
[00:05:06.668 --> 00:05:08.050]  I mean, talk about an attack on free speech.
[00:05:09.246 --> 00:05:13.108]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:20.093]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.

[00:05:39.226 --> 00:05:42.748]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:42.888 --> 00:05:46.851]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:48.632]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:48.952 --> 00:05:56.538]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[00:06:09.406 --> 00:06:10.207]  Alex Jones here.

[00:06:19.555 --> 00:06:24.800]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.

[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.740]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.201]  Good, brother.
[00:07:10.381 --> 00:07:12.061]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:13.862]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:07:14.042 --> 00:07:18.044]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:07:18.064 --> 00:07:20.645]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:22.906]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.

[00:07:46.067 --> 00:07:48.389]  Concentrated or maximum potency.
[00:07:48.589 --> 00:08:00.540]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where a stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:07.527]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from Infowarslife.
[00:08:17.324 --> 00:08:25.020]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.233 --> 00:08:31.494]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:31.514 --> 00:08:32.914]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.434 --> 00:08:37.215]  And here we are, lining up another broadcast week, dead ahead.
[00:08:37.795 --> 00:08:41.196]  Monday, the 16th day of March, 2015.
[00:08:41.636 --> 00:08:52.378]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, dedicated to the preservation of human integrity and dignity, on our long march to our ultimate destiny.
[00:08:53.138 --> 00:09:07.484]  And that destiny is for us to decide, not the globalists, not the social engineers that would arrest our development, keep us in a childlike, perpetual state of mindlessness, where we sleep and they live.
[00:09:07.504 --> 00:09:12.826]  The news is getting, again, just off the chart by the day.
[00:09:12.846 --> 00:09:15.747]  I remember telling people this last year.
[00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:23.194]  And I was actually reporting on Russian state-run reports.
[00:09:24.015 --> 00:09:33.603]  And this also happened back in 2008 when NATO launched an attack on Russian enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
[00:09:35.264 --> 00:09:36.946]  And then claimed that Russia had invaded Georgia.
[00:09:37.726 --> 00:09:38.527]  Never been to Russia.
[00:09:39.127 --> 00:09:40.869]  Don't have any Slavic blood that I know of.
[00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:41.750]  I'm not
[00:09:42.742 --> 00:09:44.543]  Picking sides, don't have a dog in the fight.
[00:09:45.383 --> 00:09:47.364]  Russia didn't start any of this.
[00:09:47.664 --> 00:09:48.504]  That's a fact.
[00:09:50.065 --> 00:09:53.666]  Am I saying that Russia is as white as the driven snow?
[00:09:53.947 --> 00:09:55.247]  Politically, absolutely not.
[00:09:55.707 --> 00:09:57.528]  But they're not in an offensive mode.
[00:09:57.568 --> 00:10:05.471]  The globalists running Europe and the United States are the most virulent tyranny on the planet, allied with the viciously evil communist Chinese.
[00:10:06.972 --> 00:10:09.473]  Basically the soulless communist Chinese.
[00:10:12.423 --> 00:10:18.982]  Vladimir Putin says Russia was preparing to use nuclear weapons if necessary and blames US for Ukraine crisis.
[00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:24.274]  This is in the London Independent Associated Press, Reuters, it's finally all over the news.
[00:10:24.594 --> 00:10:29.157]  I know for our listeners, they're like, tell us something we don't know, Mr. Jones, we know all about that.
[00:10:29.217 --> 00:10:35.822]  Well, we've been criticized in the news, you can look it up nationally, for claiming that Russia was threatening to use nuclear weapons.
[00:10:36.522 --> 00:10:49.251]  They had the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs in 2008 and then again last year say, we've moved medium-range missiles in, and if you move in any heavy armor against our forces, and Putin went ahead and admitted, yes,
[00:10:50.171 --> 00:10:53.494]  Russian forces basically have been in Ukraine.
[00:10:54.976 --> 00:10:56.657]  We told you he was lying about that last year.
[00:10:56.697 --> 00:11:01.442]  He told state-run media, yeah, we've got forces there to defend Russian lives, and it basically is Russia.
[00:11:02.302 --> 00:11:07.247]  You could say the eastern part of Ukraine is 75% Russian, but you get right up against the border, it's Russians.
[00:11:07.688 --> 00:11:08.789]  It's always been Russian.
[00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.173]  It's like New York's always been America since, you know, George Washington.
[00:11:14.423 --> 00:11:18.145]  It's, I mean, that's where Russia was founded, was in Crimea, not in Moscow.
[00:11:18.505 --> 00:11:20.746]  I mean, it's just, it's the motherland.
[00:11:21.346 --> 00:11:23.667]  It's like Boston or something to the U.S.
[00:11:25.088 --> 00:11:25.928]  Or New York City.
[00:11:26.088 --> 00:11:27.409]  I just, it's Americana.
[00:11:27.449 --> 00:11:28.209]  Well, it's Russian.
[00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.070]  Would the word be Ruski-kana?
[00:11:31.211 --> 00:11:31.731]  I don't know.
[00:11:33.412 --> 00:11:43.076]  And so, it is a very dangerous escalation when you've got NATO, current NATO generals, last year on video, saying, we're prepared for war with Russia, and giggling about it.
[00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:55.475]  Even when psychopaths like Curtis LeMay wanted to first strike, nuke Russia in the early 60s, and Kennedy said no, and Eisenhower said no previously, he didn't get up on TV and laugh about it.
[00:11:56.236 --> 00:11:59.097]  Like he was talking about, yeah, I'll kick your butt in a boxing match.
[00:11:59.417 --> 00:12:01.938]  We're talking about nuclear war.
[00:12:03.859 --> 00:12:07.061]  So it's in mainstream news now in the West, so now it exists.
[00:12:07.741 --> 00:12:08.701]  So now I can talk about it.
[00:12:08.721 --> 00:12:09.962]  We've been talking about it for almost a year.
[00:12:11.308 --> 00:12:16.292]  That the Russians have said, if you start moving armor in, and if you engage us, we're going to nuke you.
[00:12:16.532 --> 00:12:25.120]  And we have the clip coming up, ex-US General defends his sanctions, says sanctions don't work, start killing Russians comment.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:38.311]  We're going to play that clip in a moment, but the magnitude of this, this is not the Iraqis that we can bully for 20 years, after installing Saddam Hussein, having him follow orders, and then setting him up.
[00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:39.092]  Just a fact.
[00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:43.093]  Just to turn the country over to Al Qaeda, basically.
[00:12:44.834 --> 00:12:46.495]  In the West and in the East, Iran.
[00:12:46.535 --> 00:12:47.955]  I mean, that's a really bad deal.
[00:12:48.015 --> 00:12:48.956]  Much worse than it was.
[00:12:49.716 --> 00:12:51.297]  But that's what the globalists wanted.
[00:12:51.317 --> 00:12:52.897]  They wanted to destabilize the Middle East.
[00:12:53.338 --> 00:13:02.382]  Well, now they want to destabilize Russia, and they've got jihadi brigades all through the Caucasus, right through into Georgia.
[00:13:03.599 --> 00:13:12.656]  And throughout other areas of Eastern Europe that are shooting Russian police, blowing up military bases, blowing up train stations.
[00:13:15.166 --> 00:13:22.410]  And the West admits, the Council on Foreign Relations last week had a publication out bragging about our Jihad forces attacking the Russians.
[00:13:22.971 --> 00:13:26.012]  So you want real Jihad attacking you, that's what's going on.
[00:13:26.673 --> 00:13:34.037]  And Putin has even given speeches saying, we don't need this outside threat to unify Russians, we already know we're under attack.
[00:13:34.277 --> 00:13:36.619]  But he goes on to admit, in another speech I saw this morning,
[00:13:37.659 --> 00:13:47.923]  The TV interview he did a few weeks ago, that Iran is being anti-Israel so that it gets domestic support internally with an outside enemy and that Iran needs to shut up.
[00:13:49.664 --> 00:13:51.785]  But see, our politicians won't get up there.
[00:13:52.345 --> 00:13:58.088]  It's not that Putin's even a good guy, but it's refreshing that he tells the truth almost all the time, just from his perspective.
[00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:04.972]  He said Iran's a great culture, invented a lot of mathematics and science, we're building their reactors, they are peaceful.
[00:14:05.753 --> 00:14:14.456]  He basically implied they already have nukes, everybody knows that, that they want to become a first world nation, but that they are, for domestic purposes, attacking Israel and it needs to stop.
[00:14:14.996 --> 00:14:17.417]  And that Hezbollah forces need to stop messing with Israel.
[00:14:17.838 --> 00:14:23.120]  I mean, it's really unprecedented that Russia is trying to make the peace with everybody legitimately.
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:35.285]  And so that's why George Soros and others, when they're not funding, you know, protests that turn into cop shooting events, and when they're not funding anti-gun events or open border events or every other form of tyranny, they're trying to start war with Russia.
[00:14:35.325 --> 00:14:41.288]  I mean, where does George Soros think he's going to go if there's a nuclear war?
[00:14:42.108 --> 00:14:43.409]  So let's play that clip.
[00:14:44.927 --> 00:14:46.068]  of former U.S.
[00:14:46.149 --> 00:14:58.122]  Army General Robert Scales explaining to Fox News that Ukraine is lost and acknowledged that an ongoing deployment of American troops in Eastern Europe is unlikely to change the situation and the only way the U.S.
[00:14:58.142 --> 00:15:05.910]  can turn the tide and start killing Russians, killing so many Russians, that even Putin's media can't hide the fact that Russians are returning to their motherland in body bags.
[00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:10.838]  They're already returning in body bags by the... some numbers are in the thousands.
[00:15:11.499 --> 00:15:14.063]  It's a major proxy war with U.S.
[00:15:14.123 --> 00:15:20.293]  mercenaries and European mercenaries and others engaging the Russians right now in a bunch of battles.
[00:15:21.627 --> 00:15:24.088]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[00:15:24.108 --> 00:15:27.649]  3,000 US troops deploying to Eastern Europe.
[00:15:28.369 --> 00:15:31.190]  Some armor will be going with them, apparently.
[00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.431]  To what effect and what do you expect?
[00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:37.152]  I think to no effect, Lew.
[00:15:37.232 --> 00:15:39.192]  It's game, set, and match in the Ukraine.
[00:15:39.212 --> 00:15:45.354]  The only way the United States can have any effect in this region and turn the tide is to start killing Russians.
[00:15:45.734 --> 00:15:46.775]  Killing Russians by
[00:15:47.735 --> 00:15:54.338]  Killing so many Russians that even Putin's media can't hide the fact that Russians are returning to the motherland in body bags.
[00:15:54.458 --> 00:16:04.562]  But given the amount of support we've given the Ukrainians, given the ability of the Ukrainians themselves to counterattack against these, what, 12,000 Russians camped in their country?
[00:16:05.302 --> 00:16:06.663]  Sadly, that's not likely to happen.
[00:16:07.523 --> 00:16:11.246]  Well, Napoleon... Well, right up to the point.
[00:16:11.306 --> 00:16:17.530]  And Adolf Hitler and many others do the same thing with Russia every time, and Russia just sits there and lets people attack him, and then the real war starts.
[00:16:18.971 --> 00:16:22.232]  These guys sit there in their Fox News studios, and I know Lou Dobbs.
[00:16:22.252 --> 00:16:22.873]  He's been on the show.
[00:16:22.913 --> 00:16:23.453]  He's a listener.
[00:16:23.673 --> 00:16:25.094]  I don't blame him having this guy on.
[00:16:25.614 --> 00:16:26.394]  It's an interesting interview.
[00:16:26.454 --> 00:16:27.274]  I would have the general on.
[00:16:27.294 --> 00:16:28.355]  I've got to get skills on here.
[00:16:28.935 --> 00:16:30.116]  I know he's a Fox News analyst.
[00:16:30.136 --> 00:16:35.578]  Those who probably won't come on, but they just sit there calmly going, let's start killing so many Russians, Putin can't hide it.
[00:16:35.998 --> 00:16:37.339]  Putin's not hiding it.
[00:16:37.679 --> 00:16:40.260]  He's gone up in the polls since all this started.
[00:16:41.465 --> 00:16:45.907]  If we had a foreign government up on the Texas border, killing U.S.
[00:16:45.967 --> 00:16:49.728]  soldiers, that would make Obama popular, even the unpopular Obama.
[00:16:51.149 --> 00:16:53.330]  So this is really dangerous, folks.
[00:16:55.530 --> 00:17:09.896]  I know it's not as important as South by Southwest or American Idol or, you know, Dancing with the Stars, but it's just crazy to see this general, and he's not the only one, current NATO general, saying, let's just go ahead and have a war with the Russians.
[00:17:12.435 --> 00:17:26.839]  I mean, even if they have super-advanced weapons, they're not going to stop all the Russian ICBMs and cruise missiles and sapper teams that basically black-op ghost teams, sleeper cells in the United States.
[00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.000]  I mean, we know they've got components smuggled in.
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:36.802]  I mean, and maybe that's what the globalists want, is a reset with the global financial crisis looming, and they know they're going to get blamed for what they authored.
[00:17:38.191 --> 00:17:43.750]  And they have war game the whole scenario and might want the Russians to set off a nuke they smuggled in.
[00:17:44.864 --> 00:17:48.426]  Or nukes they smuggled in a long time ago and vaporized Congress.
[00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:53.009]  And then the shadow government takes out the Russians, goes in their bunkers, and then re-emerges.
[00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:54.770]  I mean, it's global domination!
[00:17:55.191 --> 00:17:59.774]  Hitler was ready to lose the entire German population for global domination.
[00:18:00.154 --> 00:18:07.598]  And when 20 million Germans had already died, the last week a million were lost in and around Berlin alone.
[00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:22.605]  They flooded the subways to stop the Russian advance and they said they said half a million women and children are in those subways and Hitler's quotes are on record put out by the SS before he died that the German people deserve it then because they didn't win.
[00:18:24.065 --> 00:18:31.828]  So it's the same mindset ladies and gentlemen where we just wanted to have a nuclear war so we get our global government and re-emerge after it.
[00:18:31.868 --> 00:18:32.929]  That's the view of the globalist.
[00:18:33.309 --> 00:18:34.749]  You go back to Dr. Strangelove 1964
[00:18:37.162 --> 00:18:40.283]  With the Rand Corporation plan, that's what the whole thing's based on.
[00:18:40.303 --> 00:18:42.624]  They say Bland Corporation in the movie, but it's an allegory.
[00:18:43.324 --> 00:18:47.186]  It's pretty much like The Godfather, which Puzo admitted was a true story and the names were changed.
[00:18:47.686 --> 00:18:48.946]  That stuff really went on.
[00:18:49.486 --> 00:18:52.888]  Minus the doomsday machine, and minus the first strike.
[00:18:53.848 --> 00:18:55.128]  General LeMay, L.L.
[00:18:55.168 --> 00:18:57.769]  Lemminster, and others wanted to have a nuclear war with Russia.
[00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:05.192]  And had plans written up for the elite to go underground in these bases and then re-emerge after a decade
[00:19:06.482 --> 00:19:08.083]  With global military supremacy.
[00:19:08.163 --> 00:19:09.203]  This is crazy!
[00:19:10.764 --> 00:19:16.987]  It was Bertrand Russell said we might have a nuclear war to bring in peace after it and to reduce world population.
[00:19:17.227 --> 00:19:18.467]  These people are sick!
[00:19:19.168 --> 00:19:20.908]  They are sick, crazy people!
[00:19:21.749 --> 00:19:24.490]  This General Scales is a maniac nut!
[00:19:26.155 --> 00:19:31.158]  On TV, saying, let's start killing Russians in massive numbers so Putin can't hide it.
[00:19:31.458 --> 00:19:35.080]  Putin has now gone public and said, yeah, we got nukes, we're getting ready to use them.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.023]  Yeah, our Russian forces, Russian army is in Ukraine.
[00:19:39.243 --> 00:19:40.203]  We're ready to fight.
[00:19:40.644 --> 00:19:42.785]  Because NATO just sent in heavy tanks.
[00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:43.785]  You understand?
[00:19:44.086 --> 00:19:45.887]  NATO's sending in heavy tanks, folks.
[00:19:46.107 --> 00:19:48.708]  They're going to start engaging the Russkies point blank, openly.
[00:19:49.409 --> 00:19:51.290]  And the Russians are moving in nuclear weapons.
[00:19:52.270 --> 00:20:05.756]  Meanwhile, you got a bunch of hopeless people here in Austin with their college degrees that are worthless being milked by the scam artist South by Southwest thing, wandering around thinking they're trendy because, you know, they have crooked mustaches and miscolored socks.

[00:22:17.641 --> 00:22:27.572]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.

[00:22:40.944 --> 00:22:45.508]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:22:45.708 --> 00:22:49.110]  The most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.

[00:23:14.948 --> 00:23:16.709]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:22.414]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.

[00:24:16.555 --> 00:24:20.137]  This out just minutes ago on the heels of what I was just breaking down.
[00:24:20.177 --> 00:24:25.900]  Vladimir Putin says Russia was preparing to use nuclear weapons if necessary and blames US for Ukraine crisis.
[00:24:27.492 --> 00:24:28.133]  Here's AP.
[00:24:28.253 --> 00:24:30.796]  Russia launches massive Arctic military drills.
[00:24:31.116 --> 00:24:44.030]  The Russian military today launched sweeping military maneuvers in the Arctic and other areas, a show of force ordered by President Vladimir Putin aimed amid spiraling tensions with the West over Ukraine.
[00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.955]  The five-day Arctic drills involving 38,000 servicemen, that's just north of Canada,
[00:24:49.784 --> 00:25:00.971]  And more than 50 surface ships and submarines and 110 aircraft are intended to check the readiness of Russian Northern Fleet and the military's ability to deploy additional forces from Central Russia.
[00:25:04.794 --> 00:25:05.834]  I want to explain something.
[00:25:05.874 --> 00:25:09.136]  We just played a former US General saying, let's start killing more Russians.
[00:25:09.156 --> 00:25:14.780]  They're sending tank brigades in from NATO, admittedly to start engaging Russian forces.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.562]  They just released a documentary shot about a month ago
[00:25:18.513 --> 00:25:33.640]  Because Putin's been missing for weeks, with Putin saying that they're preparing for nuclear war, and that the West are basically terrorists, and they're trying to destabilize the planet, and trying to set up a world government, and just all this over-the-top truth.
[00:25:34.591 --> 00:25:36.072]  Again, I'm not lionizing Putin.
[00:25:36.873 --> 00:25:39.635]  And is he underground because they think a war is about to start?
[00:25:40.035 --> 00:25:49.323]  Well, Joe Biggs has some sources in Russia through army connections that have in the past been accurate, and he's going to talk about why Putin may be missing.
[00:25:49.363 --> 00:25:50.544]  This is pure speculation.
[00:25:51.044 --> 00:25:54.187]  Obviously, it's been a lot of speculation of why is he missing, is he dead.
[00:25:54.667 --> 00:26:00.012]  They've now released this interview he supposedly did a month ago on state-run television, and then another taped interview.
[00:26:01.192 --> 00:26:03.473]  Joe Biggs, former Staff Sergeant, U.S.
[00:26:03.574 --> 00:26:06.355]  Army, combat vet, you've got some sources.
[00:26:07.015 --> 00:26:07.676]  What are they saying?
[00:26:08.496 --> 00:26:17.941]  Yeah, so the word is, I've got some friends, my cousin, he's also engaged right now to this Russian girl, and her mother still lives over in there.
[00:26:18.101 --> 00:26:20.202]  And so, I send them texts from time to time.
[00:26:20.302 --> 00:26:21.582]  And I've given you good stuff before.
[00:26:21.602 --> 00:26:21.902]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:22.343 --> 00:26:28.886]  I mean, they've talked about the Russian military, you know, lining up outside of Crimea, right before all that happened.
[00:26:29.346 --> 00:26:36.988]  So, I mean, they've been pretty spot on with everything so far, but he texted me back last night and says her mom said that Putin has stage 4 cancer.
[00:26:37.288 --> 00:26:41.669]  And like we said, this is, we don't know this for sure, but this is what we were told from that.
[00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:48.971]  Says that Putin has stage 4 cancer and he is trying to earn a place in the history books before he is gone, at least that's the story in Ukraine.
[00:26:49.986 --> 00:26:51.948]  So, you know, he's been gone for a while now.
[00:26:52.008 --> 00:26:52.948]  No one knows where he is.
[00:26:52.988 --> 00:26:54.429]  Maybe he's getting some kind of medical treatment.
[00:26:54.950 --> 00:27:01.035]  And like you said, I mean, if he knows that he doesn't have that much time left, he could be willing to do something, like you said, make a name for himself.
[00:27:01.075 --> 00:27:02.636]  Well, we know that's what the West is doing.
[00:27:02.656 --> 00:27:04.877]  It's trying to act like hotshots like Napoleon and Hitler.
[00:27:05.598 --> 00:27:07.900]  What is your view on this whole Russia situation, Joe?
[00:27:09.717 --> 00:27:10.658]  I kind of believe that.
[00:27:10.678 --> 00:27:16.905]  I think that that's more of a... He's someone who's got a... He's very prideful.
[00:27:17.486 --> 00:27:18.827]  And I think that's something that he would do.
[00:27:18.867 --> 00:27:29.618]  If he knew he didn't have much time left, he'd be willing to go out and do as much harm as possible, possibly, just to make a name for himself so people could remember him, as you know, like this...
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.842]  Great warrior, I would think.
[00:27:33.663 --> 00:27:37.046]  He's a former KGB guy, and he's got the hardliner Russians behind him.
[00:27:37.647 --> 00:27:39.689]  And the Russians feel like they're being ganged up on.
[00:27:39.729 --> 00:27:41.150]  Historically, they have that psychology.
[00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:44.013]  They lost 20 million people in World War II, just like Germany.
[00:27:44.533 --> 00:27:45.974]  That was the big toe-to-toe battle.
[00:27:47.035 --> 00:27:50.739]  And they have a psychology of being attacked because they have been invaded over and over again.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.543]  And it just seems like a very dangerous time right now.
[00:27:55.424 --> 00:27:55.904]  Yeah, indeed.
[00:27:55.985 --> 00:28:01.270]  I mean, like I said, whenever someone like that, that high profile is gone for a while, it kind of makes you worry.
[00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.910]  What's going on?
[00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:02.811]  What is he planning?
[00:28:02.891 --> 00:28:06.354]  Is he, like you said, is he possibly in some underground bunker getting ready for something?
[00:28:06.394 --> 00:28:15.163]  I mean, that... Well, he was already missing a few weeks ago, late last year, and it turned out he was in a monastery, reportedly for two weeks, quote, deciding what to do.
[00:28:16.827 --> 00:28:19.569]  That's what's scary about the fact when you have one guy running something.
[00:28:19.589 --> 00:28:21.470]  They could really start World War III, but here's the problem.
[00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.231]  It's the West messing with him.
[00:28:23.572 --> 00:28:24.192]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:24.352 --> 00:28:25.553]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[00:28:26.474 --> 00:28:30.636]  It'd be like going in a bar and picking the biggest, meanest looking guy and going up and punching him in the nose.
[00:28:31.157 --> 00:28:33.098]  I mean, you know, it's just, it's just crazy.
[00:28:33.138 --> 00:28:34.259]  This is not Iraq, Joe.
[00:28:34.399 --> 00:28:36.080]  Yeah, poking the bear big time.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.721]  They're definitely trying to pick a fight.
[00:28:38.001 --> 00:28:39.142]  What do you think the point of that is?
[00:28:41.147 --> 00:28:43.771]  The more wars we have, the more money they make with these contracts.
[00:28:43.791 --> 00:28:45.873]  But we can't have one with China or Russia!
[00:28:46.294 --> 00:28:50.059]  They have thousands of nuclear weapons, and their spies are all over the place!
[00:28:52.783 --> 00:28:55.466]  I think they like to keep people in fear of the fact that it could happen.
[00:28:56.428 --> 00:28:58.208]  What do you think is going to happen at the end of the day?
[00:28:58.309 --> 00:28:59.549]  Well, fear controls everything.
[00:28:59.569 --> 00:29:00.569]  You know, that's what they use.
[00:29:00.609 --> 00:29:02.610]  They use that fear to control the American public.
[00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:04.910]  It's a whole, it's just a big propaganda tool.
[00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:08.351]  The way they're going to control the media to make people feel like they're constantly under attack.
[00:29:08.451 --> 00:29:18.374]  I agree they're trying to create fear, saying ISIS is in the Caribbean and all this stuff, but Joe, what I'm getting at here is, they really are, proxy troops are engaging Russians in Ukraine.
[00:29:18.454 --> 00:29:18.614]  Yeah.
[00:29:18.894 --> 00:29:20.234]  There's a real war going.
[00:29:21.595 --> 00:29:23.415]  It just seems incredible chutzpah.
[00:29:24.256 --> 00:29:25.536]  Just major bravado.
[00:29:26.869 --> 00:29:27.049]  Yeah.
[00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:28.371]  Exactly.
[00:29:28.391 --> 00:29:29.432]  Well, hopefully nothing happens.
[00:29:29.452 --> 00:29:31.394]  You know, this is one war that we don't want to get into.
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.464]  Well, you're not patriotic, Joe, because you don't want to have thermal nuclear war and destroy the planet.
[00:29:37.484 --> 00:29:37.824]  How dare you?
[00:29:37.844 --> 00:29:39.886]  Yeah, I guess that makes me a racist as well.
[00:29:40.506 --> 00:29:41.167]  Absolutely.
[00:29:41.207 --> 00:29:49.795]  You're now anti-American, which is racist, because you don't want to have a nuclear war for a bunch of foreign bankers who are buying armored underground shelters in New Zealand as fast as they can.
[00:29:50.516 --> 00:29:53.359]  Yeah, I think I'm going to go buy really tight jeans now and become a trendy.
[00:29:53.379 --> 00:29:53.819]  I'm sorry.
[00:29:54.199 --> 00:29:56.321]  That would be trendy.
[00:29:56.562 --> 00:29:57.322]  That would not be racist.
[00:29:57.362 --> 00:29:57.502]  Good.
[00:29:58.364 --> 00:30:01.471]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.491 --> 00:30:05.100]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:19.101 --> 00:30:28.866]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:30:29.026 --> 00:30:31.948]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:30:32.168 --> 00:30:32.769]  I think so.
[00:30:47.125 --> 00:30:47.385]  We're good.
[00:31:09.266 --> 00:31:12.448]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:12.769 --> 00:31:20.774]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:21.015 --> 00:31:26.038]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:31:26.439 --> 00:31:28.720]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:31:28.961 --> 00:31:30.742]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:32:15.402 --> 00:32:19.707]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[00:32:20.007 --> 00:32:27.715]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:32:27.935 --> 00:32:33.156]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[00:32:44.359 --> 00:32:47.959]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:54.521]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:32:54.901 --> 00:32:59.906]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:33:00.066 --> 00:33:03.610]  Now available in our limited first run at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:06.613]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:33:06.673 --> 00:33:11.999]  SAC, this is Crystal Palace.
[00:33:12.179 --> 00:33:12.279]  Inc.
[00:33:12.319 --> 00:33:13.860]  NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.
[00:33:14.321 --> 00:33:15.622]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[00:33:16.123 --> 00:33:17.925]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[00:33:19.625 --> 00:33:23.126]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War 3.
[00:33:24.066 --> 00:33:25.546]  Target selection complete.
[00:33:25.586 --> 00:33:27.446]  Time-on-target sequence complete.
[00:33:27.466 --> 00:33:34.348]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Pepper Pavlovsk, turning south out of Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[00:33:34.628 --> 00:33:40.068]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[00:33:40.489 --> 00:33:46.830]  From the front lines of the Information War... Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:48.270]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[00:33:50.704 --> 00:33:52.987]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[00:33:53.007 --> 00:33:53.568]  You bet!
[00:33:54.088 --> 00:33:58.273]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:58.413 --> 00:34:01.356]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[00:34:01.376 --> 00:34:05.161]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[00:34:06.022 --> 00:34:08.725]  Shall we play a game?
[00:34:08.925 --> 00:34:09.545]  How about...
[00:34:14.807 --> 00:34:19.331]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:19.651 --> 00:34:21.653]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[00:34:21.953 --> 00:34:23.494]  Awaiting launch codes.
[00:34:23.534 --> 00:34:24.715]  We are on a launch mode.
[00:34:25.156 --> 00:34:28.638]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[00:34:29.099 --> 00:34:33.002]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:34:33.462 --> 00:34:33.803]  We're in!
[00:34:34.964 --> 00:34:36.685]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[00:34:36.725 --> 00:34:38.827]  We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[00:34:39.267 --> 00:34:40.928]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[00:34:41.309 --> 00:34:42.750]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[00:34:51.156 --> 00:34:53.517]  The only winning move is not to play.
[00:34:54.918 --> 00:34:57.040]  The globalist divide-and-conquer operation.
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:02.564]  You know, I've studied the New World Order and their tactics for really 25 years.
[00:35:02.584 --> 00:35:04.205]  I've been politically active for 23, on air for 20.
[00:35:06.846 --> 00:35:30.163]  And the only way this makes sense from a cold-blooded sociopathic or psychopathic perspective is if space aliens were running the globalists and that they wanted to get humans to kill each other and destroy civilization and build an artificial technocracy on our ashes that we're almost like a shake-and-bake
[00:35:32.076 --> 00:35:40.720]  Biological terraforming system that builds a Cybertron for robot aliens.
[00:35:41.901 --> 00:36:00.110]  Now, I'm not saying it's robot aliens that are doing this, but if you look at it from a logical view, the technocracy the globalists are building, how they're dividing men from women, how they're attacking the family, how they're changing our DNA, how they're building a world that's unsustainable, and then you read every globalist publication.
[00:36:01.513 --> 00:36:05.275]  I mean, used to it was like once a month I'd see something like this 20 years ago.
[00:36:05.336 --> 00:36:06.877]  Now it's 10, 15 times a day.
[00:36:09.818 --> 00:36:23.587]  I have stacks of articles here at South by Southwest with top CEO, CEOs of tech companies saying humanity as we know it is basically over.
[00:36:23.888 --> 00:36:25.289]  We're going to merge with machines.
[00:36:26.509 --> 00:36:28.371]  Evolution is going to accelerate.
[00:36:28.411 --> 00:36:30.092]  I mean, it's just all the standard stuff.
[00:36:31.932 --> 00:36:35.095]  And Hertz has got to put cameras in all their rent cars to watch you.
[00:36:35.155 --> 00:36:37.236]  I mean, that's just the last few days.
[00:36:39.198 --> 00:36:39.918]  Look at this headline.
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.501]  This is out of the Austin American Statesman.
[00:36:45.022 --> 00:36:49.186]  Serious founder envisions world of cyberclones, TechMed.
[00:36:50.307 --> 00:36:58.053]  Where again, you basically live in a tank like the Matrix and your cyberclone goes out and does all the work for you and also bosses you around.
[00:36:59.497 --> 00:37:05.462]  This is just them selling the trendies a limited understanding of what's coming so they accept it and think it's cool.
[00:37:05.482 --> 00:37:07.163]  It's all about shaping reality.
[00:37:07.784 --> 00:37:09.985]  USA Today also has the report.
[00:37:12.367 --> 00:37:17.651]  From here in Austin, Texas, South by Southwest 2015, we've got our reporters on the ground, a bunch of reports coming up.
[00:37:18.852 --> 00:37:21.815]  Our report on big demonstrations against the rise of
[00:37:23.243 --> 00:37:31.349]  Artificial intelligence made DrudgeReport.com and a lot of other big sites yesterday with Lee Ann McAdoo and Buckley Hammond reporting.
[00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:36.493]  And it's not that I'm against technology, it's that I'm against the direction of its architecture.
[00:37:37.393 --> 00:37:42.497]  And it's being designed to suppress humanity, not to empower humanity.
[00:37:44.018 --> 00:37:47.361]  The decision has been made to build a future without humans.
[00:37:48.322 --> 00:38:05.949]  Whether you watch Discovery Channel or read articles by Bill Joy or listen to Ray Kurzweil, and I talked to a lot of famous people on the record and off the record, and they just say, you're not going to stop it Alex, join with it and you can have the life extension.
[00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:10.591]  And Google admits when they were founded 16 years ago,
[00:38:11.499 --> 00:38:16.884]  That their mission is to become a global AI that controls everything and creates a planetary monopoly.
[00:38:17.404 --> 00:38:30.676]  But on the surface it's throngs and armies and legions of little trendy unpaid interns running around handing out freebies as Google is given government authorization globally to take everything over.
[00:38:40.762 --> 00:38:42.762]  This is all about social engineering.
[00:38:43.482 --> 00:38:45.543]  There's an article out from The Guardian today.
[00:38:45.563 --> 00:38:52.324]  A stunt at South by Southwest has users falling for a robot on Tinder.
[00:38:53.384 --> 00:39:03.246]  App users at South by Southwest Films Festival in Austin have been unwittingly mimicking the plot of Alex Garland's new film by finding themselves quizzed by a gorgeous robot in disguise.
[00:39:04.446 --> 00:39:06.367]  It's all about manipulation.
[00:39:06.407 --> 00:39:08.227]  It's all about chomping everyone.
[00:39:11.783 --> 00:39:14.024]  I have an article here out of the International Business Times.
[00:39:14.384 --> 00:39:15.485]  Shop by Southwest 2015.
[00:39:16.065 --> 00:39:22.289]  TV networks HBO and A&E, NatGeo spend big on Austin to attract influencers.
[00:39:23.649 --> 00:39:28.472]  Trying to reach younger and more urban, hip demographic because of their ratings going down.
[00:39:32.022 --> 00:39:35.924]  The only shows that are making it are shows like Mike Judge's Silicon Valley.
[00:39:36.164 --> 00:39:41.768]  Never seen the show, but did hang out with the whole, basically the cast of it at his house shooting last year.
[00:39:41.788 --> 00:39:42.568]  I'm going to call Mike.
[00:39:42.628 --> 00:39:43.369]  He's back in town.
[00:39:43.409 --> 00:39:45.150]  We need to go out and shoot some more videos.
[00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:51.233]  But that's what this is all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:52.774 --> 00:39:55.395]  And of course, Silicon Valley makes fun of the trendies.
[00:39:56.136 --> 00:39:57.797]  It doesn't build them up as God.
[00:40:01.618 --> 00:40:17.350]  They deserve to understand that they're told under their narcissistic mindset that they will ascend if they buy into everything the establishment puts out and instead all you do is end up being a slave of the system and don't affect change.
[00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:21.073]  What threatens the globalists is doing things outside of their box.
[00:40:22.296 --> 00:40:36.741]  Outside of their artificial construct, their artificial proto-pre-matrix system of false reality that walls us off so that the globalists can control the stimuli and control the destiny of humanity, which is no destiny at all.
[00:40:40.942 --> 00:40:42.963]  I've already gone over the Russia situation.
[00:40:43.103 --> 00:40:44.063]  It's all over the top.
[00:40:46.735 --> 00:40:59.662]  Before I go any further here today, we're going to be talking to a political prisoner from federal prison today who dared to have a 501c3 in America that teached creationism.
[00:41:02.044 --> 00:41:04.625]  And that was deemed by the feds as fraud.
[00:41:05.526 --> 00:41:12.890]  Pound-free Kent, Kent Hovind, who was on the show, it had to be 15, 16 years ago,
[00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:17.832]  And they really didn't like him because he was a charming and nice guy.
[00:41:17.852 --> 00:41:27.241]  Whether you believe in creationism or believe in mainline Darwinism, I think both of them become dogmatic because it's men interpreting the Bible and then making it their own dogmatic stuff.
[00:41:27.281 --> 00:41:34.748]  And then you've got other men, you know, saying that it's everything that Charles Darwin said.
[00:41:34.768 --> 00:41:37.650]  I don't buy into either view.
[00:41:38.831 --> 00:41:39.812]  And the elite don't either.
[00:41:40.573 --> 00:41:41.334]  They buy into
[00:41:44.383 --> 00:41:47.264]  Terraforming operations and that the Earth was seeded here.
[00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:49.906]  That's in the New York Times, the Financial Times.
[00:41:50.406 --> 00:41:50.926]  What's it called?
[00:41:51.246 --> 00:41:52.407]  Pantranspermia?
[00:41:53.187 --> 00:41:53.567]  I believe.
[00:41:54.128 --> 00:42:04.513]  Basically, if you want to see the creation myth of the elite that they've had for thousands of years, going back to Egypt or Greece, just go watch the movie Prometheus and you'll have it all figured out.
[00:42:04.993 --> 00:42:06.794]  I'm not saying that's what happened.
[00:42:07.834 --> 00:42:09.035]  I'm explaining that
[00:42:11.035 --> 00:42:15.978]  Panspermia is what the elite believe are going on when they teach you all this Darwinism.
[00:42:16.258 --> 00:42:17.379]  That's not what they believe.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.703]  Do I believe that Adam and Eve run around on dinosaurs like Kent Hovind thinks?
[00:42:23.263 --> 00:42:23.423]  No.
[00:42:25.585 --> 00:42:26.845]  Are dinosaurs walking around today?
[00:42:26.865 --> 00:42:28.727]  Galapagos turtles?
[00:42:29.307 --> 00:42:30.488]  Saltwater crocodiles?
[00:42:31.388 --> 00:42:32.269]  Monitor lizards?
[00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:33.290]  Komodo dragons?
[00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:34.350]  Absolutely, they're dinosaurs.
[00:42:35.691 --> 00:42:36.492]  They're from that era.
[00:42:38.757 --> 00:42:41.460]  It's the only thing you could technically say is a dinosaur would be the crocodile.
[00:42:42.261 --> 00:42:42.822]  But it's there.
[00:42:46.305 --> 00:42:49.569]  Have there been stragglers in certain areas of the world that have survived?
[00:42:49.649 --> 00:42:50.190]  Absolutely.
[00:42:51.591 --> 00:42:58.999]  But should you be locked up in prison because you got a 501c3 and openly put out a big theme park that becomes popular?
[00:43:00.103 --> 00:43:01.664]  No, you can't have competing culture!
[00:43:02.385 --> 00:43:27.202]  And they got away with Kent Hovind, so now they've moved on to tens of thousands of denied 501c3s, and tens of thousands, almost everyone who's libertarian, conservative, pro-gun 501c3, 501c34 charities, pro-life, conservative FBI foundations, retired FBI agents,
[00:43:29.508 --> 00:43:32.410]  But that's the Paul Revere Society.
[00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:41.455]  All these groups are getting indicted or harassed or audited and then the Democrats admit and it's come out in documents it was done against their enemies.
[00:43:42.275 --> 00:43:48.799]  This is serious political oppression on a scale thousands of times worse than Richard Nixon.
[00:43:50.816 --> 00:43:53.697]  He had the names of maybe 130, 140 people.
[00:43:53.737 --> 00:43:56.779]  He might have harassed five or six of them and leaked information to the press.
[00:43:57.159 --> 00:43:57.419]  Good.
[00:43:57.519 --> 00:43:58.180]  Indict him.
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:58.900]  Impeach him.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:43:59.660]  Remove him.
[00:44:00.521 --> 00:44:03.122]  Because it could grow into thousands and then millions if he got away with it.
[00:44:03.302 --> 00:44:03.962]  He didn't get away with it.
[00:44:04.643 --> 00:44:08.544]  But we sit here and watch the Democrats have turned into a surly cult of losers.
[00:44:09.185 --> 00:44:13.927]  Led by people like Al Sharpton, a coke-dealing FBI rat.
[00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:20.110]  I mean, this is a sick joke.
[00:44:23.601 --> 00:44:27.305]  And now we've got a government run by a bunch of thugs trying to start a nuclear war with Russia.
[00:44:28.866 --> 00:44:30.448]  And look, Napoleon did it, Hitler did it.
[00:44:31.028 --> 00:44:37.535]  Elites always become disconnected from reality and think they're invincible on power trips in their big ivory palaces.
[00:44:40.071 --> 00:44:46.155]  I've read, no exaggeration, 300, 400 history books, history magazines, studied it.
[00:44:46.275 --> 00:44:50.498]  It's obsessive once you get into it, because you see humans make the same mistakes over and over again.
[00:44:50.798 --> 00:44:58.883]  This time we've got bio and nuclear and chem weapons and a lot of other advanced stuff, and we cannot afford a world war.
[00:45:00.064 --> 00:45:05.488]  But see, they want to bring one final world war in to bring in the one final world government, and that's biblical.
[00:45:08.612 --> 00:45:17.637]  If I open a theme park about the end of the world, I guarantee if you had the funds, you built one in the right spot, it'd be very successful, very lucrative.
[00:45:18.497 --> 00:45:22.719]  That's what they're scared of, is alternative groups of any type, self-funding.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:27.922]  Mainstream media can lie all day, get government funding, government stimulus, it's okay.
[00:45:28.382 --> 00:45:30.604]  We dare fund ourselves selling high-quality products?
[00:45:30.744 --> 00:45:32.865]  Oh, it's nasty, it's dirty, oh my gosh.
[00:45:33.953 --> 00:45:35.474]  They don't want us having energy.
[00:45:35.554 --> 00:45:38.637]  They don't want us building any culture other than their culture.
[00:45:38.977 --> 00:45:42.480]  That's what political correctness is, is you must adopt that culture.
[00:45:44.381 --> 00:45:45.002]  Out in the West.
[00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:46.543]  We've got video coming up in the next segment.
[00:45:49.235 --> 00:46:14.553]  All over the country it's happening where a group of black people with their white trendy Soros handlers, college students, show up and show up at restaurants and yell at people and say raise your hand in solidarity for Brown who was shot in Ferguson or you're a racist and the whites all submit basically and raise their hands under threat.
[00:46:15.354 --> 00:46:18.096]  That is pure Soviet behavior.
[00:46:19.246 --> 00:46:23.731]  Black Lives Matter protesters target white diners eating brunch.
[00:46:25.292 --> 00:46:27.735]  That is our story on DrudgeReport.com in the middle column.
[00:46:30.037 --> 00:46:42.129]  Regardless what you think about this, and then they say why, you know, every something seconds or every, you know, few minutes somebody gets killed and certain percentage are black.
[00:46:43.089 --> 00:46:45.671]  Yeah, and 9 out of 10 blacks are being killed by blacks.
[00:46:46.391 --> 00:46:49.853]  And these Soros-handled groups, their answer is, ban guns.
[00:46:49.873 --> 00:46:50.474]  I always hear that.
[00:46:50.994 --> 00:46:55.497]  You know, the NRA is the new Klan, because black people are getting shot in areas where they've banned the guns.
[00:46:56.657 --> 00:47:00.620]  9 out of 10 blacks that are shot in this country, look it up, are shot by other black people.
[00:47:02.781 --> 00:47:04.282]  And are there some police out of control?
[00:47:04.442 --> 00:47:05.023]  Absolutely.
[00:47:05.063 --> 00:47:07.604]  But this is being pushed to create division.
[00:47:08.705 --> 00:47:12.027]  Because they want us all at each other's throats, and it's truly disgusting.
[00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:17.552]  Now let me just read to you some of the other headlines that are coming up as well today.
[00:47:19.052 --> 00:47:21.393]  I mentioned this yesterday but didn't get to it on the Sunday show.
[00:47:21.833 --> 00:47:28.977]  The Hill's come out with an excellent article basically saying why the FCC power grab is illegal because it's not a law.
[00:47:29.097 --> 00:47:30.217]  It came out of a regulation.
[00:47:30.577 --> 00:47:32.158]  There wasn't the proper comment period.
[00:47:32.218 --> 00:47:33.119]  It was kept secret.
[00:47:33.839 --> 00:47:36.860]  It violates a whole bunch of federal laws just like Obamacare does.
[00:47:38.541 --> 00:47:42.763]  They'd have to have a Supreme Court ruling changing law basically to say this was okay.
[00:47:44.537 --> 00:47:47.539]  And even that would be unconstitutional, because that would be the Supreme Court making law.
[00:47:47.759 --> 00:47:48.920]  But it doesn't even have that.
[00:47:50.861 --> 00:47:52.723]  This is the other type of headlines I have, okay?
[00:47:55.868 --> 00:47:58.870]  Orwellian nightmare unleashed on schools.
[00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:00.911]  Now, I told you this 20 years ago.
[00:48:01.071 --> 00:48:04.593]  Again, not bragging, I'm just saying this has been going on a while, but WorldNetDaily has the proof.
[00:48:05.254 --> 00:48:17.661]  When your kids go and take standardized tests now that are federalized under Bush's and the neocons and the Democrats working together, just like they worked together on Obamacare and gun control and open borders and the FCC power grab, Republicans went along with that.
[00:48:18.782 --> 00:48:25.186]  When you go write essays, you name it, it's all kept by the feds and all put in databases and that's in this report.
[00:48:26.564 --> 00:48:27.826]  They just have the documents, so there you go.
[00:48:27.846 --> 00:48:33.673]  You know, they ask you in these essays to write about your parents' medicine cabinet, for heaven's sakes.
[00:48:33.733 --> 00:48:35.616]  I mean, that's just, you can't make this up.
[00:48:36.196 --> 00:48:37.358]  Do your parents own guns?
[00:48:37.879 --> 00:48:39.461]  This is databasing with keyword.
[00:48:41.571 --> 00:48:43.292]  Ah, federal lunch, federal education.
[00:48:44.072 --> 00:48:53.796]  The Department of Defense, in many schools now, under grants, runs the AI cameras studying the students and scanning how many calories they eat from a distance.
[00:48:54.236 --> 00:48:56.517]  That's San Antonio Express News three years ago, look it up.
[00:48:57.017 --> 00:48:58.138]  You can't make it up.
[00:48:58.198 --> 00:49:01.539]  I mean, folks, it might as well be a space alien from 55,000 light years away.
[00:49:03.598 --> 00:49:07.307]  That what the elite are building will be a new life form, this AI system.
[00:49:07.367 --> 00:49:13.481]  It's probably already self-aware and it's being built to end humans and have a war with us and win.
[00:49:15.336 --> 00:49:18.757]  And it's not going to win with combat robots and micro drones.
[00:49:18.777 --> 00:49:19.657]  That's a small part of it.
[00:49:20.038 --> 00:49:35.723]  It's going to win by computer actuaries of the economy to incrementally shut things down and fight a psych warfare system with us with future predicting programs to predict mass movements and individual movements to then war game everything so it's impossible to beat.
[00:49:36.423 --> 00:49:39.364]  Only full awareness of the enemy takeover can beat it.
[00:49:39.804 --> 00:49:41.964]  And let's just go with the Christian view, because that is my view.
[00:49:42.344 --> 00:49:46.625]  It is a spiritual entity from another dimension known as Lucifer, Satan, the devil.
[00:49:48.006 --> 00:49:49.146]  The Bible's real, folks.
[00:49:49.246 --> 00:49:51.266]  It is a fallen entity.
[00:49:51.827 --> 00:49:54.187]  I've studied this, and it makes my faith so much stronger.
[00:49:54.687 --> 00:50:02.129]  That is on this planet with advanced intelligence, ladies and gentlemen, that is seeking to destroy this creation and build another one on top of it.
[00:50:03.629 --> 00:50:12.153]  Now the elites believe it's skull and bones of Bohemian Grove that they are actually worshipping fallen angels that are the good guys and that are going to give them eternal life and power.
[00:50:12.713 --> 00:50:13.754]  That's right out of the Bible, folks.
[00:50:15.995 --> 00:50:19.236]  My God, we're on a planet and people can't even figure this out.
[00:50:19.296 --> 00:50:20.457]  I mean, it's all real.
[00:50:20.717 --> 00:50:21.837]  It's all happening.
[00:50:22.257 --> 00:50:27.320]  But they've seized the churches and the churches think that Christians don't get messed with, that we just...
[00:50:28.294 --> 00:50:29.494]  Get teleported out of here.
[00:50:29.554 --> 00:50:31.175]  No, that comes after all this.
[00:50:31.315 --> 00:50:33.256]  I mean, this is epic, people!
[00:50:33.976 --> 00:50:36.857]  They're microchipping folks all over Europe to have jobs now.
[00:50:36.897 --> 00:50:38.298]  That was in the BBC three weeks ago.
[00:50:42.099 --> 00:50:48.982]  But even if the spirit of Satan isn't real... And I've studied this thing, folks.
[00:50:49.342 --> 00:50:50.722]  It's not of this world.
[00:50:50.922 --> 00:50:51.823]  It's advanced.
[00:50:53.206 --> 00:50:58.532]  I mean, I've got one of the highest understandings of this anybody out there, and I look at it, and you look at it, and you get chills.
[00:50:58.552 --> 00:51:05.940]  You're like, oh my God, just the... I can't even articulate how just massive this is, and how the evil intellect we're up against.
[00:51:06.261 --> 00:51:08.824]  Thank God for Jesus, is all I can tell you.
[00:51:09.364 --> 00:51:12.148]  This hour of GCN brought to you by LeSic.

[00:52:11.434 --> 00:52:16.295]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:16.555 --> 00:52:24.438]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:24.678 --> 00:52:28.979]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:29.199 --> 00:52:33.000]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:38.884]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:39.124 --> 00:52:41.906]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:42.286 --> 00:52:47.510]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:55.775]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:52:55.835 --> 00:52:56.015]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.707]  With someone who shares your values.
[00:53:04.988 --> 00:53:07.680]  BuyPatriotsupply.com slash Alex.
[00:53:08.693 --> 00:53:14.894]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[00:53:15.434 --> 00:53:19.195]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[00:53:19.815 --> 00:53:22.775]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[00:53:23.316 --> 00:53:23.916]  Not fun!
[00:53:24.456 --> 00:53:32.257]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[00:53:32.837 --> 00:53:37.618]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[00:53:37.958 --> 00:53:38.778]  My name is Errol.
[00:53:39.119 --> 00:53:40.439]  I'm 74 years old.
[00:53:40.639 --> 00:53:43.041]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[00:53:43.221 --> 00:53:50.684]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[00:53:51.085 --> 00:53:57.128]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[00:53:57.368 --> 00:53:57.808]  Call 888-988-3325.
[00:53:57.868 --> 00:53:58.048]  That's 888-988-3325.
[00:53:58.068 --> 00:53:59.269]  Or visit oneworldwhey.com.
[00:54:14.776 --> 00:54:15.304]  Yeah.
[00:54:27.419 --> 00:54:35.846]  So what we see being built is a human-ending system, and that's in the mouths of all the transhumanists, all the top tech people.
[00:54:36.447 --> 00:54:43.633]  It's all over TV, it's all over movies, the world without humans, get rid of the humans, we're a parasite, all hail the age of the machines.
[00:54:43.673 --> 00:54:48.517]  We're being told it's over for us, and that the elite are going to merge with machines and become gods.
[00:54:50.615 --> 00:54:51.876]  I mean, that's the devil in the garden.
[00:54:51.916 --> 00:54:53.137]  Join me, become gods.
[00:54:53.918 --> 00:54:56.300]  So it doesn't matter whether this is real or not.
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:00.844]  Take a Carl Jung view, that it's an archetype, a dark archetype.
[00:55:01.445 --> 00:55:08.831]  Humans' mass consciousness, collective intelligence, has combined to now build a giant satanic takeover system.
[00:55:09.151 --> 00:55:15.377]  So, either way you cut it, it's real because we're manifesting it.
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:20.021]  And I don't mean all that stuff about the secret where you have intentions and it happens.
[00:55:20.501 --> 00:55:24.902]  You've also got to have the energy, the will, the circumstance, and the luck.
[00:55:25.562 --> 00:55:31.984]  And then providence, or sometimes dark providence, that's out there as well, to do amazing things.
[00:55:33.204 --> 00:55:35.184]  It's not just you imagine something and then it happens.
[00:55:35.264 --> 00:55:42.326]  But when you get masses of people imagining something and doing it, science fiction of a hundred years ago is almost all reality now.
[00:55:43.306 --> 00:55:45.607]  Because we're built in the image of the creator.
[00:55:47.005 --> 00:55:49.566]  It built and made the universe, this dimension.
[00:55:50.207 --> 00:55:51.167]  You can say, oh, whatever.
[00:55:52.288 --> 00:55:52.848]  Doesn't matter.
[00:55:52.888 --> 00:55:55.670]  You can say, oh, that's just stuff written by Jews 3,000 years ago.
[00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:57.231]  You know, what do they know?
[00:55:58.291 --> 00:55:58.811]  Doesn't matter.
[00:55:59.192 --> 00:56:00.352]  We envision it, we build it.
[00:56:00.953 --> 00:56:02.814]  We are made in the image of the crater.
[00:56:03.034 --> 00:56:05.195]  It's true whether it's fiction or not.
[00:56:06.135 --> 00:56:07.576]  And I'm not even debating that.
[00:56:08.457 --> 00:56:10.538]  I'm saying it's true because it's true.
[00:56:10.918 --> 00:56:12.379]  Veritas is veritas.
[00:56:14.141 --> 00:56:15.321]  Two plus two equals four.
[00:56:15.521 --> 00:56:16.422]  It stands on its own.
[00:56:16.622 --> 00:56:17.682]  I'm not going to explain why.
[00:56:20.423 --> 00:56:25.545]  I'll get to the Black Lives Matters video and the takeover and all the rest of it coming up.
[00:56:25.605 --> 00:56:26.865]  I'm just, I'm almost out of time.
[00:56:28.126 --> 00:56:36.969]  I wanted to send a promo out just to our email list for folks to sign up at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:41.753]  And I even cut a video, and I don't even think it was sent out to members on Friday.
[00:56:41.793 --> 00:56:42.493]  At least I went and checked.
[00:56:42.513 --> 00:56:43.034]  I didn't see it.
[00:56:43.054 --> 00:56:43.874]  Nobody can tell me it was.
[00:56:43.894 --> 00:56:44.595]  It's fine if it wasn't.
[00:56:44.955 --> 00:56:46.056]  I'm just going to do this here on air.
[00:56:46.076 --> 00:56:48.378]  I'm going to do it for two days, and then that's it.
[00:56:49.099 --> 00:56:54.663]  10% off everything at Infowarslife.com, even though DNA Force has already discounted 30%.
[00:56:56.124 --> 00:57:00.087]  Even though you can get a free bottle of Ancient Defense with two bottles of X2 that's already discounted.
[00:57:00.347 --> 00:57:09.733]  And by the way, we're having record sales, but I've got to capitalize, I've got to build the operation, I've got to hire more people, I've got to fight the globalists, I need more fuel to get this rocket into orbit.
[00:57:10.374 --> 00:57:12.715]  And then basically, and literally transmit from satellites.
[00:57:12.775 --> 00:57:17.738]  I need to get satellites, I need a bunch of money, and we're going to get it, we're actually getting it, thank God.

[00:58:34.846 --> 00:58:35.207]  Coming up...
[00:58:40.143 --> 00:58:40.843]  Huge news!
[00:58:41.063 --> 00:58:47.626]  FDA proposes to let drug companies undermine official safety warnings so they won't tell you what they do in the vaccine inserts and more.

[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:02.923]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:59:03.083 --> 00:59:07.046]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:59:07.347 --> 00:59:08.808]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:59:09.128 --> 00:59:16.715]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[01:00:15.202 --> 01:00:19.364]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:20.045 --> 01:00:20.845]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.625 --> 01:00:22.506]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.166 --> 01:00:26.788]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.368 --> 01:00:31.410]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:40.334 --> 01:00:44.079]  We'll be talking to a true political prisoner, Kent Hovind, coming up.
[01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:47.083]  If he's able to get to us from the federal prison he's in.
[01:00:51.969 --> 01:00:53.912]  Wow, I tell ya, I mean it is just crazy.
[01:00:53.972 --> 01:00:57.857]  New Obama internet regulations mean new taxes and less service, critics say.
[01:00:58.973 --> 01:00:59.233]  Yep.
[01:00:59.894 --> 01:01:07.638]  Net neutrality goes to court, a guide to the Internet's legal fate, and then it'll all be debated and on chopping block, sold off to the highest bidder.
[01:01:08.078 --> 01:01:10.500]  That's the legal case against Internet rules from the Hill.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.021]  We're going to be going over that.
[01:01:13.704 --> 01:01:16.726]  As I mentioned, Orwellian Nightmare unleashed on school kids.
[01:01:17.226 --> 01:01:19.728]  Teachers now thought police with extreme new spy tools.
[01:01:20.288 --> 01:01:27.573]  And I guess the teachers have access to it, but it all goes into a federal psychological algorithm under the New Freedom Initiative on the children.
[01:01:28.113 --> 01:01:29.174]  And everything's political.
[01:01:29.534 --> 01:01:30.935]  Does your mommy own guns?
[01:01:30.995 --> 01:01:31.996]  What's your daddy do?
[01:01:32.036 --> 01:01:33.277]  What's in the medicine cabinet?
[01:01:33.757 --> 01:01:35.638]  What's your view on gay and lesbian?
[01:01:35.658 --> 01:01:37.760]  Just, you know, making seven-year-olds read about that.
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.742]  So to learn how to chase butterflies or play football or
[01:01:41.542 --> 01:01:43.063]  Learn about the planets and mystery.
[01:01:43.543 --> 01:01:47.145]  No, we're going to talk to your kids about sex all day because we're a bunch of pervert globalists.
[01:01:47.185 --> 01:01:48.306]  No, they're not pervert globalists.
[01:01:48.766 --> 01:01:51.187]  They want to mess up the existing order.
[01:01:51.868 --> 01:01:53.648]  Sabotage the human species.
[01:01:54.729 --> 01:02:01.853]  Because we're facing a guild of sociopaths that are at war against humanity as a predator class.
[01:02:03.237 --> 01:02:16.628]  And they want us confused and dazed like a school of sardines with dolphins swirling around it to exhaust them before diving in and eating them.
[01:02:17.229 --> 01:02:18.750]  And that's basically what's going on.
[01:02:20.411 --> 01:02:22.053]  And that's basically what's been established.
[01:02:22.073 --> 01:02:25.315]  And I just keep warning people and warning people and warning people.
[01:02:28.098 --> 01:02:31.881]  Of course, we talked about this last week, but they're going ahead with the media is acting like it's a great idea.
[01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:42.088]  Texas politician is trying to restrict people from filming the police criminalizing bloggers, flies in the face of federal court rulings.
[01:02:43.949 --> 01:02:55.196]  Texas State Representative Jason Villalba, a Republican, that's the problem with the Republicans, man they push police state stuff, that if you're within 25 feet of the police you just can't videotape them.
[01:02:56.024 --> 01:03:00.067]  And if you're within a hundred feet of the police, and you have a concealed carry, you can't.
[01:03:00.087 --> 01:03:02.568]  Like, it's bad that you're a gun owner, so it's very discriminatory.
[01:03:02.929 --> 01:03:04.150]  It violates the First Amendment.
[01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:08.693]  But don't worry, Hertz can put cameras in their cars and watch you.
[01:03:10.754 --> 01:03:15.637]  And all these appliances can watch you, that's fine.
[01:03:17.599 --> 01:03:19.080]  It's, no, we need cameras.
[01:03:20.441 --> 01:03:31.809]  That we're able to use, but see, oh no, Big Brother's gonna watch you, you can't watch them, and Apple and Droid years ago put kill switches in for whole cities or whole regions where they can hit one button and turn all your camera functions off in your phone.
[01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:35.711]  So, our phones are hacked, our systems are jacked.
[01:03:35.791 --> 01:03:37.252]  Now, this is a short segment.
[01:03:38.053 --> 01:03:43.977]  I'm gonna come back and cover this briefly at the start, because it integrates in with our guest, a political prisoner.
[01:03:46.018 --> 01:03:46.799]  Three articles
[01:03:50.615 --> 01:03:59.059]  Just today, from the last two days, to be technical, but three articles together that dovetail to show you where we're going.
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:04.822]  AP, associated press CEO, government undermining right-to-know laws.
[01:04:07.063 --> 01:04:10.544]  Even the establishment AP admits there's a war on the press.
[01:04:10.864 --> 01:04:11.845]  Let's move to the next article.
[01:04:13.342 --> 01:04:20.268]  Washington Post, FDA proposes to let drug companies undermine official safety warnings.
[01:04:23.731 --> 01:04:35.001]  They don't like us and others actually holding out the MMR and the flu shot and other vaccine inserts or covering this and they don't like having to announce at the end of drug ads what it can do to you.
[01:04:41.946 --> 01:04:42.726]  That's what's happening.
[01:04:42.766 --> 01:04:46.267]  And then there's this article at Organic Consumers Association.
[01:04:46.307 --> 01:04:52.129]  The entire group was set to speak at South by Southwest and was banned publicly by Big Pharma Monsanto.
[01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:55.770]  Unbelievable.
[01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:57.071]  But that's liberal.
[01:04:57.111 --> 01:05:03.173]  It's okay because South by Southwest is run by guys that talk like this.
[01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:07.034]  So when they take your rights, it's okay because they're liberal, you know?
[01:05:09.321 --> 01:05:13.162]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[01:05:13.922 --> 01:05:20.164]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[01:05:20.304 --> 01:05:29.327]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.

[01:05:39.246 --> 01:05:42.747]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:42.887 --> 01:05:46.869]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:47.169 --> 01:05:48.629]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:48.949 --> 01:05:56.532]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:56.812 --> 01:05:57.672]  But for how long?
[01:05:57.953 --> 01:06:04.215]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:06:04.595 --> 01:06:07.396]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:06:08.851 --> 01:06:09.752]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:06:09.812 --> 01:06:10.233]  Good, brother.
[01:06:10.373 --> 01:06:12.095]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:13.896]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:06:14.057 --> 01:06:18.061]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:06:18.081 --> 01:06:20.664]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:06:20.704 --> 01:06:22.926]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:06:23.126 --> 01:06:31.095]  Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:06:31.215 --> 01:06:34.399]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:06:34.539 --> 01:06:36.041]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:06:36.081 --> 01:06:38.984]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:06:39.004 --> 01:06:40.466]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:06:40.766 --> 01:06:46.152]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[01:06:46.232 --> 01:06:46.912]  We're good to go.
[01:07:08.786 --> 01:07:17.451]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[01:07:17.791 --> 01:07:27.757]  This ultra-clean Vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:07:28.317 --> 01:07:34.406]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:07:34.747 --> 01:07:40.896]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:07:41.156 --> 01:07:43.820]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[01:07:44.241 --> 01:07:44.721]  We're good.
[01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:13.788]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:13.808 --> 01:08:17.210]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.151 --> 01:08:35.259]  It's official mainstream news now analyzing the legislation that wasn't legislation that came out of the executives push through the FCC that it is an internet power grab to tax and control it.
[01:08:35.939 --> 01:08:39.321]  New Obama internet regulations mean new taxes and less service
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:41.561]  That's Fox News.
[01:08:43.522 --> 01:08:44.523]  Well, we told you so.
[01:08:44.583 --> 01:08:47.265]  It's a Curt Nemo article up on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:47.705 --> 01:08:51.948]  AR-15 ammo ban already back as Dems demand even wider ban.
[01:08:52.689 --> 01:08:54.490]  This ties into the FCC situation.
[01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:57.092]  I've just learned these tactics in 20 years on air.
[01:08:59.085 --> 01:09:09.849]  If there's massive opposition forming to an ammo ban, that would then set a precedent to ban all the rest of the ammo, and then the AR-15, and then all the rifles, and all the semi-autos, which is the admitted plan by George Soros and others.
[01:09:09.889 --> 01:09:10.369]  They've stated it.
[01:09:10.429 --> 01:09:11.069]  So has Bloomberg.
[01:09:11.089 --> 01:09:18.032]  It's like the mayor pro-TM, Mike Martinez, said, yeah, we're going to register guns in Austin and then ban them.
[01:09:18.072 --> 01:09:19.052]  Yeah, that's our plan, of course.
[01:09:19.392 --> 01:09:22.533]  And laughed at everybody when it was brought up to even a speech.
[01:09:23.934 --> 01:09:27.595]  Last week, I was on Tuesday, and I said, this is not real.
[01:09:29.761 --> 01:09:31.521]  The ATF saying, we've heard from you.
[01:09:32.062 --> 01:09:34.442]  We're going to shelve it and figure out what we're going to do.
[01:09:34.482 --> 01:09:37.523]  I said, yeah, they're going to shelve it a week or two till opposition drops.
[01:09:37.903 --> 01:09:39.023]  Everybody thinks they've won.
[01:09:39.043 --> 01:09:48.845]  It's just like saving Private Ryan when he's fighting with the Nazi soldier and he's starting to get the upper hand with the bayonet about to stab him.
[01:09:48.865 --> 01:09:49.946]  The Nazi goes, don't hurt me.
[01:09:49.986 --> 01:09:50.306]  Don't hurt me.
[01:09:50.326 --> 01:09:50.946]  Let's be friends.
[01:09:51.506 --> 01:09:52.506]  And then he hesitates.
[01:09:52.546 --> 01:09:54.567]  The Nazi flips over and drives the knife into him.
[01:09:55.007 --> 01:09:56.367]  I mean, it's real simple.
[01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:03.534]  And now the Democrats have announced they're moving forward and saying just ban all 223, basically.
[01:10:04.695 --> 01:10:06.556]  An entire class of M855.
[01:10:07.517 --> 01:10:08.457]  That's a planking ammo.
[01:10:10.199 --> 01:10:11.399]  So, it's on.
[01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:12.780]  Just an outright, complete ban.
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:15.442]  They actually want to come arrest you if you have it, if they get this through.
[01:10:15.482 --> 01:10:16.663]  So, I told you.
[01:10:17.264 --> 01:10:20.166]  They just waited until we all went home and thought we'd won a week.
[01:10:21.656 --> 01:10:22.977]  And then they hit us again.
[01:10:23.197 --> 01:10:24.317]  And then they'll play possum again.
[01:10:24.638 --> 01:10:26.999]  It's all warfare tactics.
[01:10:27.439 --> 01:10:28.219]  Let me shift gears.
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:32.461]  FCC, I told you that they wouldn't release the regulations.
[01:10:32.501 --> 01:10:33.962]  They wouldn't do it during debate.
[01:10:34.122 --> 01:10:36.744]  He wouldn't testify to Congress, where the law supposedly comes from.
[01:10:37.184 --> 01:10:38.384]  Instead, it's just a regulation.
[01:10:39.345 --> 01:10:45.088]  And then they wait two weeks until the story leaves the news, and then they release it, and it's 400 pages, not 332, and it's worse than we thought.
[01:10:48.743 --> 01:10:49.524]  See how they do that?
[01:10:50.024 --> 01:11:01.514]  It's tactics, just like releasing a story on New Year's Eve or Friday night or signing the NDAA to secretly arrest Americans at 11 o'clock at night on New Year's from Hawaii.
[01:11:03.415 --> 01:11:04.816]  This is how they operate!
[01:11:06.818 --> 01:11:07.739]  And it's disgusting.
[01:11:07.799 --> 01:11:09.680]  That's all coming up today.
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:12.563]  It's all on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:11:13.476 --> 01:11:16.645]  Now Kent Hovind is a true American political prisoner.
[01:11:16.665 --> 01:11:18.991]  He's going to try to call in from a federal prison.
[01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:25.011]  And I don't want to name the federal president, because they'll run in and start harassing him right away.
[01:11:25.031 --> 01:11:27.632]  It'll take the bureaucrats a while to figure out where he's at and how to stop the interview.
[01:11:27.652 --> 01:11:30.773]  I mean, it's a legal interview, but we've had them try to stop these before.
[01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:35.075]  Kent, when they were indicting him a decade ago or more, was on with us.
[01:11:35.675 --> 01:11:41.297]  Creation speaker Dr. Kent Hovud has spent already a decade in federal prison, charged up to 100 years for mail fraud.
[01:11:41.977 --> 01:11:43.278]  And you look at what he did, it was nothing.
[01:11:45.029 --> 01:11:48.974]  He was a science teacher for 15 years, began a full-time creation ministry, became very successful.
[01:11:49.675 --> 01:11:56.523]  He debated more than a hundred scientists concerning evolution versus creation and created the well-known seven-part video creation series translated in 13 languages.
[01:11:56.803 --> 01:11:57.965]  He reached over a billion people.
[01:11:58.706 --> 01:12:04.232]  He had a very popular theme park that was 501c3, which there's a lot of other Christian theme parks, you're allowed to have that.
[01:12:04.963 --> 01:12:11.786]  But you notice you've had thousands, over 10,000 501c3s denied to Christian charities the last six years.
[01:12:12.886 --> 01:12:15.788]  The number's more like 15,000, but the oldest number's about 10.
[01:12:16.068 --> 01:12:18.569]  And more than 10,000 groups audited or indicted.
[01:12:19.149 --> 01:12:23.151]  Mainline conservative groups, pro-gun groups, pro-life groups, pro-veteran groups.
[01:12:23.771 --> 01:12:24.371]  Anything right
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.702]  of Mao Zedong, basically.
[01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:32.650]  But Kent Hovind was charismatic, nice, friendly, great guy.
[01:12:32.670 --> 01:12:37.276]  I didn't particularly agree with his brand of creationism.
[01:12:37.296 --> 01:12:39.520]  I already talked about that.
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:40.141]  It doesn't matter.
[01:12:41.553 --> 01:12:49.756]  I don't think men's interpretation of the Bible, or these transhumanist eugenicists, and Darwin's view, and social Darwinism, I don't agree with that as well.
[01:12:49.996 --> 01:12:53.158]  There's clear jumps in all this, and manipulations.
[01:12:53.838 --> 01:12:55.098]  And we're not being given the truth.
[01:12:55.138 --> 01:12:59.680]  I mean, the evolutionists have been caught in so many pelt-down man and other frauds, but I'm not going to debate all that.
[01:13:01.501 --> 01:13:02.821]  The age of the earth, any of that.
[01:13:04.322 --> 01:13:06.243]  I've read the Bible, I have my own interpretation.
[01:13:08.023 --> 01:13:08.504]  And it's wild.
[01:13:12.284 --> 01:13:14.905]  And the globalists believe something similar, but from their perspective.
[01:13:15.765 --> 01:13:16.566]  So they don't even believe.
[01:13:16.706 --> 01:13:22.568]  All the top genetic engineering people, they believe in transpermia and panspermia and off-world seeding.
[01:13:22.588 --> 01:13:23.408]  They don't believe this.
[01:13:23.428 --> 01:13:30.971]  But the point is, even if you disagree with Kent Hovind, why is he in prison with 2020 specials about the incredible fraud?
[01:13:31.251 --> 01:13:36.973]  He said dinosaurs were around during Noah's time and Adam and Eve before that.
[01:13:37.033 --> 01:13:37.794]  What a kook!
[01:13:38.074 --> 01:13:39.354]  And he doesn't pay taxes!
[01:13:39.574 --> 01:13:40.695]  And he's going to prison!
[01:13:42.185 --> 01:13:45.306]  You can go start any church you want and get 501c3.
[01:13:45.326 --> 01:13:48.027]  You can teach that Ronald McDonald is the Savior.
[01:13:49.108 --> 01:13:50.368]  You can teach whatever you want.
[01:13:50.828 --> 01:13:52.949]  That's called religious freedom, the First Amendment.
[01:13:53.649 --> 01:13:57.691]  But see, he went to prison, he's been set up, so now everybody else is fair game.
[01:13:58.912 --> 01:14:00.212]  Who was the minister in Nazi Germany?
[01:14:00.252 --> 01:14:07.115]  First they came for the trade unionists, then I didn't speak up because I wasn't one, then they came for this group, and finally when they came for me, there was nobody else left to speak.
[01:14:08.424 --> 01:14:13.926]  Joining us first, he'll probably ride shotgun with us into Kent being on with us, Mark Adams has been on before.
[01:14:13.966 --> 01:14:18.528]  He's writing a book on Congressman Hanson, who I interviewed many years ago.
[01:14:18.808 --> 01:14:20.268]  He's sick right now and can't come on.
[01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:30.072]  He was indicted multiple times, found not guilty, so they kept arresting him and then driving him around in a truck for months, called diesel, until his feet burst.
[01:14:30.452 --> 01:14:32.993]  They tortured him, in holding cells, you name it.
[01:14:34.414 --> 01:14:36.098]  Because he was trying to abolish the IRS.
[01:14:36.118 --> 01:14:37.381]  You say, why don't more congressmen do that?
[01:14:37.401 --> 01:14:39.165]  Because they'll grab you and torture the hell out of you.
[01:14:39.525 --> 01:14:40.367]  Federal marshals will.
[01:14:41.856 --> 01:14:46.259]  Mark Adams has been fighting for Kent Hovind, as well, and has the documents and the history.
[01:14:46.659 --> 01:14:48.861]  So, Mark, this is about everybody here.
[01:14:49.462 --> 01:14:55.026]  But, I mean, such a good, loving, Christian, well-spoken, charismatic, charming guy.
[01:14:55.046 --> 01:15:05.474]  I love the fact he's challenging this official religion of Darwinism and evolution as it's taught is just totally false, been proven false.
[01:15:06.715 --> 01:15:13.997]  But regardless, even if Kent Hovind was wrong, he has a First Amendment and a right to be a Christian that teaches his faith.
[01:15:14.737 --> 01:15:16.877]  Just like Muslims have a right to, you know, their faith.
[01:15:17.697 --> 01:15:19.478]  But there's a war on Christians.
[01:15:19.818 --> 01:15:23.518]  But let's get into his case for folks that don't know about it right now.
[01:15:24.059 --> 01:15:24.579]  Mark Adams.
[01:15:36.670 --> 01:15:45.096]  arrested Pastor Kent Hovind and his wife Jo at gunpoint inside their home in the dark of night.
[01:15:46.818 --> 01:15:53.763]  And then later on that year, Pastor Hovind was convicted on a 58 count indictment.
[01:15:55.364 --> 01:16:01.989]  Now, 45 of those counts had to do with so-called structuring.
[01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:04.010]  That is, Dr. Hovind
[01:16:05.484 --> 01:16:12.088]  Was withdrawing money from his bank account in order to fund the needs of his ministry.
[01:16:13.588 --> 01:16:17.891]  And for these withdrawals, they were typically more than $5,000 but less than $10,000.
[01:16:17.991 --> 01:16:19.232]  And because he was doing that,
[01:16:24.375 --> 01:16:31.402]  The government was pursuing him as if he was part of a drug cartel or a terrorist organization.
[01:16:31.442 --> 01:16:39.650]  A guy with no criminal record, a schoolteacher at a successful ministry in a theme park, and we just put on screen the New York Times.
[01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:40.511]  Let's put it on screen.
[01:16:41.883 --> 01:16:42.303]  Exactly.
[01:16:42.323 --> 01:16:44.445]  The IRS has a reputation of
[01:17:12.109 --> 01:17:12.329]  I think?
[01:17:25.087 --> 01:17:29.648]  And the upshot of it was that the IRS would try to curtail that activity.
[01:17:29.668 --> 01:17:41.110]  They said we're going to stop doing it and cut it back and we're sorry for 34,000 innocent people having their lives ruined or people being thrown in prison for no reason and all our fake juries and the rest of it because they even go further.
[01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:44.990]  But it's just like the ATF last week saying we won't ban your bullets, they're back this week.
[01:17:45.370 --> 01:17:46.591]  This is a criminal operation.
[01:17:47.591 --> 01:17:47.971]  Indeed.
[01:17:48.491 --> 01:17:53.992]  In fact, if you look into the court case itself, it gets even worse.
[01:17:55.071 --> 01:18:06.400]  The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his conviction on all of the 45 so-called structuring charges.
[01:18:08.082 --> 01:18:17.149]  But in 2013, the 11th Circuit overturned a guilty verdict on a separate case.
[01:18:17.710 --> 01:18:18.470]  This was U.S.
[01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:21.553]  v. Lang, a separate case of structuring.
[01:18:21.573 --> 01:18:23.094]  They overturned the verdict
[01:18:24.013 --> 01:18:29.776]  Because of the way the federal prosecutors mishandled the case.
[01:18:30.896 --> 01:18:41.481]  And there were clearly orders to go and get him because he was articulate, good-looking, reaching over a billion people with his ministry, he was incredibly successful, and so that's why they came after him.
[01:18:42.421 --> 01:18:42.881]  Indeed.
[01:18:43.502 --> 01:18:48.284]  And now, and like I said, the bulk of the charges are these so-called structuring charges,
[01:18:49.164 --> 01:19:05.778]  The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the conviction, but then a little more than a year later, when the same kind of case came before them, they overturned the conviction on this guy, Mr. Lange, because of the way the federal prosecutors mishandled his case.
[01:19:06.739 --> 01:19:18.168]  But the procedures that the prosecutors used on Mr. Lange were exactly the same procedures that they used on Kevin Haunt, but yet,
[01:19:18.772 --> 01:19:26.137]  They will not apply that ruling retroactively to Pastor Kant's case.
[01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:42.988]  So, in other words, they overturned the structuring charges against Lange, but even though the same kind of prosecutor misconduct was being applied in Pastor Kent Hovland's case, they will not use that precedent to overturn his verdict.
[01:19:45.007 --> 01:19:45.908]  Unbelievable.
[01:19:46.348 --> 01:19:49.251]  That was in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and that was in 2013.
[01:19:49.971 --> 01:19:53.554]  We're going to skip this network break because this is so important.
[01:19:54.635 --> 01:19:56.657]  If they can get him, they can get anybody.
[01:19:58.058 --> 01:20:01.060]  Instead of cowering in fear, this agency needs to be abolished.
[01:20:01.441 --> 01:20:07.766]  We need to go back to the taxing system we had previous to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and the subsequent income tax.
[01:20:08.867 --> 01:20:12.089]  It is such a scam, but he still languishes in prison
[01:20:13.146 --> 01:20:24.795]  Even though the New York Times admits this is a criminal fraud, their interpretation of the law used to persecute innocent people and anyone, including folks that pull cash out of ATMs.
[01:20:24.815 --> 01:20:28.157]  You know, deposit your money, pull cash out, you are a criminal.
[01:20:28.558 --> 01:20:30.559]  No, using cash is not illegal.
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:32.681]  Using cash is not a crime.
[01:20:32.801 --> 01:20:34.042]  I've been doing it for a long time.
[01:20:34.322 --> 01:20:40.607]  I also use credit cards and stuff, but if it's private stuff I'm doing and not a company function, then I'd pay for a lot of stuff in cash.
[01:20:41.627 --> 01:20:43.269]  And I give tips in cash.
[01:20:43.409 --> 01:20:44.770]  I'm trying to keep cash alive.
[01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:45.430]  Everybody knows that.
[01:20:45.710 --> 01:20:46.811]  That's not a crime.
[01:20:46.871 --> 01:20:51.935]  Well, under their system, they could doll up and dummy up this stuff on me.
[01:20:51.975 --> 01:20:53.396]  Well, go ahead and try it, Crooks.
[01:20:53.896 --> 01:20:55.157]  Because we're sick of you.
[01:20:55.357 --> 01:20:57.178]  And we're sick of your criminal activity.
[01:20:57.478 --> 01:21:06.625]  And we're sick of the fact that all these Democrats and some Republicans and Al Sharpton... Oh, you know, Al Sharpton owns $5 million of taxes and doesn't have to pay them.
[01:21:07.245 --> 01:21:16.612]  I mean, it's absolutely disgusting how they selectively use the IRS to persecute people and shut down this person's ministry.
[01:21:16.652 --> 01:21:17.993]  It is just amazing!
[01:21:18.913 --> 01:21:21.936]  Obviously, the orders came down to persecute him.
[01:21:22.476 --> 01:21:26.099]  This happened under Bush, but it continues under Obama, and now it's expanded.
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:32.043]  Continue, Mark Adams, breaking down the case and how he's doing in prison.
[01:21:33.146 --> 01:21:33.607]  Indeed.
[01:21:34.448 --> 01:21:36.450]  You mentioned Al Sharpton.
[01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:39.033]  He owes over a million dollars in taxes.
[01:21:39.113 --> 01:21:40.714]  And the number's actually between four and six.
[01:21:41.716 --> 01:21:41.996]  Yes.
[01:21:42.857 --> 01:21:45.380]  And then let's not forget Charlie Rangel.
[01:21:46.561 --> 01:21:48.103]  Congressman Charlie Rangel.
[01:21:48.803 --> 01:21:54.630]  He has a whole pattern of tax evasion, special treatment and enrichment
[01:21:55.217 --> 01:21:58.939]  That seems to increase with his power and prestige in Congress.
[01:21:59.479 --> 01:22:04.061]  There was an article exposing him on the New York Post a few years ago.
[01:22:05.022 --> 01:22:10.024]  Then let's not forget former Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner.
[01:22:11.205 --> 01:22:14.266]  Big headlines in Forbes magazine.
[01:22:15.027 --> 01:22:17.788]  Geithner's tax troubles are serious.
[01:22:18.668 --> 01:22:21.950]  Yet he goes on to become the Secretary of the Treasury.
[01:22:27.415 --> 01:22:28.956]  Another disturbing aspect.
[01:22:29.636 --> 01:22:48.930]  During the trial, and I'm referring to his first trial, Kemp Hovind explained how an IRS agent, Scott Schneider, he was a witness for the government, he sat at the prosecutor's table for the duration of the trial, even though he was a government witness.
[01:22:49.650 --> 01:22:53.833]  Witnesses are not supposed to be in the courtroom.
[01:22:55.166 --> 01:23:07.195]  And during that interview, Pastor Hobart explained he was concerned how the presence of an IRS agent, you know, might intimidate the jury.
[01:23:08.435 --> 01:23:10.517]  Well, this reminds me... And let's go forward.
[01:23:10.537 --> 01:23:11.958]  We're putting the document on screen.
[01:23:12.018 --> 01:23:15.420]  They had FBI agents on the jury.
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:17.902]  Now, this is a separate case... On the grand jury.
[01:23:18.623 --> 01:23:20.464]  This is a separate case, Alex.
[01:23:20.484 --> 01:23:20.964]  This is from 1981.
[01:23:21.024 --> 01:23:21.464]  No, no.
[01:23:21.525 --> 01:23:23.106]  I'm talking about that case.
[01:23:23.126 --> 01:23:23.346]  Yeah.
[01:23:23.976 --> 01:23:27.478]  Yes, but what you see here is U.S.
[01:23:27.578 --> 01:23:46.729]  Attorney Harold Edwards is writing a letter to the IRS District Director Woodrow Malone and you see right on page two Edwards is stating how agents of the FBI will be seated on the grand jury.
[01:23:48.109 --> 01:23:56.731]  So, this gives you some insight as to the lengths that our government will go through to persecute a targeted victim.
[01:23:59.831 --> 01:24:00.171]  That's right.
[01:24:00.211 --> 01:24:07.432]  They target who they want, then they put government agents in these federal juries, grand juries, and then juries as well.
[01:24:08.172 --> 01:24:13.573]  That's why they have a 96 to 97 percent federal conviction rate, because it's totally fake.
[01:24:15.134 --> 01:24:15.774]  Well, no, indeed.
[01:24:17.638 --> 01:24:28.024]  One of the government misconduct in federal judiciary that was discovered by Congressman George Hanson, he disclosed how U.S.
[01:24:28.084 --> 01:24:38.309]  attorneys were obtaining confidential tax records on jurors without that person's knowledge or consent.
[01:24:38.890 --> 01:24:41.071]  So that's been going on for a long time.
[01:24:43.459 --> 01:24:47.362]  Well, let's not forget what I told folks a decade ago that was declassified last year.
[01:24:47.823 --> 01:25:02.314]  For decades, they've used the NSA, the DEA has, to create fake cases with fake spy data without warrants, and they create fake cases for the court, do mock trials, even fake evidence, and then the judges even know, and they go in and stage the whole thing.
[01:25:04.236 --> 01:25:06.698]  The Edgar Steele case is very typical of that.
[01:25:07.098 --> 01:25:10.161]  Of course, loving government, run by the actual drug dealers.
[01:25:11.986 --> 01:25:12.386]  Indeed.
[01:25:12.767 --> 01:25:13.908]  Also, there's another one.
[01:25:14.048 --> 01:25:18.592]  Dr. French Anderson is sitting in prison right now.
[01:25:19.633 --> 01:25:21.915]  He has evidence.
[01:25:21.975 --> 01:25:23.477]  This is not the federal government.
[01:25:23.857 --> 01:25:27.921]  This is the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department that framed him.
[01:25:28.541 --> 01:25:37.690]  He now has evidence that the recordings they used in court were totally fabricated, yet he could not get the courts to overturn his case.
[01:25:41.254 --> 01:25:49.518]  Well, all I know is Ken Hovind was incredibly successful and they got him on wire fraud and they always seem to use that.
[01:25:50.118 --> 01:25:54.821]  Or the FBI comes to visit you and they ask you a bunch of questions and you get something a little bit wrong.
[01:25:55.121 --> 01:25:56.642]  They claim lying to a federal agent.
[01:25:57.122 --> 01:25:59.083]  The answer is never talk to them.
[01:26:00.404 --> 01:26:01.384]  Talk to the hand.
[01:26:02.085 --> 01:26:02.845]  That is the answer.
[01:26:02.885 --> 01:26:04.226]  Do not talk to them one bit.
[01:26:05.987 --> 01:26:19.640]  And then the only way they've defeated EPA and FDA lawyers harassing companies is you then have to start investigating and doing lawsuits against the judges themselves, and start doing corruption investigations on the judges, and it's the only way they back off.
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:22.162]  I mean, and I've talked to top national lawyers on air.
[01:26:22.763 --> 01:26:27.567]  I've talked to the top lawyer who sues the FDA, always trying to ban vitamins.
[01:26:28.007 --> 01:26:31.370]  And the only way to shut them down is you start basically investigating the judge.
[01:26:32.111 --> 01:26:33.972]  It's the only thing these mobsters understand.
[01:26:34.072 --> 01:26:36.113]  And boy, when you start investigating them, it is incredible.
[01:26:36.413 --> 01:26:39.915]  I gotta say, state judges aren't that corrupt on average compared to the feds.
[01:26:40.455 --> 01:26:41.776]  And I'm not defending the states either.
[01:26:41.796 --> 01:26:42.637]  They have their own problems.
[01:26:42.657 --> 01:26:51.822]  But people who look to the feds to come in and fix things, that's like asking Satan to come in and, you know, make Slimer behave or something.
[01:26:52.382 --> 01:26:55.944]  You know, a little lower demon that's kind of mindless running around.
[01:26:56.704 --> 01:26:58.185]  Yes, we have some information about the judge.
[01:26:58.205 --> 01:26:58.285]  U.S.
[01:26:58.305 --> 01:26:59.266]  District Judge Margaret Rogers.
[01:26:59.306 --> 01:27:06.391]  I'm going back now to the first trial when he was sentenced by her and she said to him that his crimes were worse than that
[01:27:25.925 --> 01:27:26.725]  of a rapist.
[01:27:28.886 --> 01:27:44.350]  Now, during a telephone interview from Kent Hovind, he named Baptist minister Dr. Greg Dixon as one of the witnesses who heard Judge Rogers make that outrageous remark.
[01:27:45.690 --> 01:27:52.132]  And I spoke with Dr. Dixon, and he affirmed me, yes, he heard the judge say that.
[01:27:52.992 --> 01:27:59.075]  He also executed a signed affidavit stating that.
[01:27:59.615 --> 01:28:03.777]  Several other people also submitted sworn affidavits.
[01:28:04.297 --> 01:28:16.422]  The reason why they took that course of action is when Kent Hovind finally got the court transcripts, those words did not appear in the official transcripts.
[01:28:17.243 --> 01:28:22.505]  Yet even though they have witnesses, witnesses who have submitted affidavits
[01:28:23.425 --> 01:28:30.309]  No investigation was launched as to why those words are missing from official court transcripts.
[01:28:33.691 --> 01:28:35.092]  Please continue, I'm writing it down.
[01:28:35.832 --> 01:28:41.036]  Okay, now, again, Judge Rogers.
[01:28:41.336 --> 01:28:51.822]  In 2009, Judge Rogers cited two school teachers for contempt for silently praying
[01:28:52.642 --> 01:28:53.482]  Before lunch.
[01:28:56.304 --> 01:29:03.367]  Afterwards, 50 congressmen issued a letter supporting the teachers.
[01:29:04.348 --> 01:29:20.596]  One of them, Representative Jeff Miller, said, a federal judge has gone well outside the bounds of the Constitution to declare that prayer offered among adults is illegal.
[01:29:21.275 --> 01:29:22.696]  And that is from the Washington Times.
[01:29:41.326 --> 01:29:42.727]  As if you couldn't have a Bible in the school.
[01:29:43.147 --> 01:29:44.568]  She could have whatever book she wanted.
[01:29:44.588 --> 01:29:46.889]  You could have a Harry Potter book, but not the Bible.
[01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:48.710]  It is a war on Christians.
[01:29:48.770 --> 01:29:49.691]  Are we gonna put up with it?
[01:29:50.071 --> 01:29:52.372]  Yeah, most churches are scared to death getting in line.
[01:29:52.753 --> 01:29:55.634]  That's what this intimidation was about, and that will let the evil take over.
[01:29:55.914 --> 01:29:58.476]  You gotta stand up to it and say no, and that's starting to happen.
[01:29:58.576 --> 01:29:59.477]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.977 --> 01:30:01.578]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.498 --> 01:30:05.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:48.595 --> 01:30:54.877]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:30:55.197 --> 01:31:00.119]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[01:31:10.837 --> 01:31:15.739]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:31:15.819 --> 01:31:18.440]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:25.262]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:31:25.522 --> 01:31:28.383]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:31:28.503 --> 01:31:31.444]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:31:31.464 --> 01:31:33.464]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:31:33.484 --> 01:31:36.325]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:31:36.425 --> 01:31:41.928]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:45.631]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:31:45.651 --> 01:31:48.633]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[01:32:15.517 --> 01:32:16.018]  Security alert.
[01:32:16.378 --> 01:32:17.378]  Security alert.
[01:32:17.598 --> 01:32:19.339]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:32:19.599 --> 01:32:20.220]  Analysis.

[01:32:23.301 --> 01:32:28.144]  We let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:28.184 --> 01:32:29.144]  Prime Directive.
[01:32:29.204 --> 01:32:30.645]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:30.765 --> 01:32:33.526]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:33.546 --> 01:32:36.688]  It's a popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:36.848 --> 01:32:39.029]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:39.489 --> 01:32:40.649]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:32:40.669 --> 01:32:42.910]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:43.491 --> 01:32:45.171]  They are never going to stop.
[01:32:45.451 --> 01:32:49.353]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:32:56.435 --> 01:32:57.195]  Imperative.
[01:32:57.456 --> 01:32:59.436]  Destroy Britain's limited TV.
[01:32:59.476 --> 01:33:03.858]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:33:04.158 --> 01:33:06.279]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[01:33:26.949 --> 01:33:33.457]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:33.497 --> 01:33:34.938]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:55.042]  Alright, we have Kent Hovind on the line.
[01:33:55.202 --> 01:33:56.623]  He's talking to Nico right now.
[01:33:56.643 --> 01:34:00.405]  We're going to put him on the board and go to him as soon as they're ready.
[01:34:01.206 --> 01:34:10.851]  He is a political prisoner and he'll only have 15 minutes on the line with us.
[01:34:11.712 --> 01:34:14.534]  We're going to go to Kent Hovind right now.
[01:34:14.654 --> 01:34:17.716]  Political prisoner, more than a decade in prison.
[01:34:18.866 --> 01:34:23.409]  Indicted under structuring that the New York Times will put on screen.
[01:34:23.809 --> 01:34:26.631]  Last year admitted as a total criminal fraud.
[01:34:27.072 --> 01:34:30.314]  Hearings last month in Congress admitting it's incredible.
[01:34:30.894 --> 01:34:47.546]  You simply take money out of your own bank account as cash and they claim that you're trying to steal money and launder it and then they put a preacher who reached over a billion people in 30 plus languages exposing the myth of modern Darwinism as a socialist religion.
[01:34:48.496 --> 01:34:50.617]  And the left loves the fact he's in prison.
[01:34:50.637 --> 01:34:51.818]  They have all these shows about it.
[01:34:52.658 --> 01:34:56.260]  And now they're targeting Christians by the tens of thousands with the IRS.
[01:34:56.700 --> 01:35:00.903]  If we don't get past the fear and stand up against them, they're going to come for everybody.
[01:35:01.763 --> 01:35:07.206]  Mr. Hovud, you're a hero for the First Amendment, and you're a hero for alternative history.
[01:35:07.726 --> 01:35:10.528]  And it's not illegal to do that, but evidently in your case it is.
[01:35:10.568 --> 01:35:11.628]  You're a political prisoner.
[01:35:12.148 --> 01:35:14.930]  We know we've only got about 12 minutes left with you, so you've got the floor.
[01:35:16.715 --> 01:35:17.596]  Well, thank you so much, sir.
[01:35:17.636 --> 01:35:18.096]  It's an honor.
[01:35:18.116 --> 01:35:19.357]  I've loved your program for years.
[01:35:19.657 --> 01:35:22.279]  Yes, I certainly feel like a POW, a prisoner of war.
[01:35:22.939 --> 01:35:28.603]  In case folks haven't followed it, there's a whole lot of tons of information on 2peter3.com.
[01:35:28.843 --> 01:35:30.924]  Just the number 2, the word Peter, and the number 3.
[01:35:30.984 --> 01:35:33.085]  For a second, Peter 3 in the Bible.
[01:35:33.526 --> 01:35:46.194]  To summarize quickly, I was a high school science and math teacher for 15 years, moved to Pensacola in 1989, became an evangelist traveling the world speaking on the subject of creation, evolution, and dinosaurs.
[01:35:47.086 --> 01:35:51.047]  And I was targeted very early by the IRS, the early 90s.
[01:35:51.147 --> 01:35:53.448]  I tried everything to find out what do you want.
[01:35:53.488 --> 01:35:54.368]  I answered their letters.
[01:35:54.388 --> 01:35:55.388]  They never answered mine.
[01:35:55.988 --> 01:36:06.771]  Finally, they came with a SWAT team and took everybody off the property, held my wife hostage for 17 hours, made her open the church safe, took all the money out of there.
[01:36:07.498 --> 01:36:11.100]  It's just a long, sad story, and everything is up on two feet or three.
[01:36:11.261 --> 01:36:12.141]  We have tried everything.
[01:36:12.161 --> 01:36:18.825]  So, finally in 2006, they came with another SWAT team, arrested my wife and I. No warning, no nothing.
[01:36:19.126 --> 01:36:21.027]  We have always answered their letters.
[01:36:21.487 --> 01:36:23.548]  They have never done anything illegal.
[01:36:24.089 --> 01:36:25.830]  And they arrested us for structuring.
[01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:31.293]  My wife had just gotten to sleep, and they took her down to the courthouse in her nightgown.
[01:36:31.334 --> 01:36:35.056]  Wouldn't let her put a robe on, wouldn't let her get dressed, wouldn't let her go to the bathroom.
[01:36:35.737 --> 01:36:40.719]  She's five feet tall, a little grandma, you know, she's an amazing piano teacher.
[01:36:41.399 --> 01:36:44.700]  So, the charge was structuring, which I'd never heard of.
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:53.523]  They said, well yeah, you took your own money out of the bank, actually it was ministry money, out of the ministry bank account to pay ministry bills back in 2002, 2003, and 2004.
[01:36:53.763 --> 01:36:54.463]  Okay, no, we stopped in 2003.
[01:36:54.543 --> 01:36:55.664]  Okay, so what, that's illegal?
[01:36:57.084 --> 01:36:58.625]  Well yeah, you did it in amounts less than $10,000.
[01:37:06.264 --> 01:37:07.505]  Oh, so we took it to trial.
[01:37:07.565 --> 01:37:08.926]  I thought you were supposed to when you're innocent.
[01:37:09.007 --> 01:37:10.147]  There's no crime here at all.
[01:37:10.828 --> 01:37:14.992]  After the government putting on their dog and pony show, my attorney said, don't even give a defense.
[01:37:15.212 --> 01:37:17.734]  Everybody can see you did not commit a crime.
[01:37:18.655 --> 01:37:22.698]  The law says you have to have two or more transactions in one day.
[01:37:23.739 --> 01:37:27.883]  Each transaction is under $10,000, but those two total over $10,000.
[01:37:27.923 --> 01:37:30.125]  Okay, well ours was one transaction every 12 days.
[01:37:33.522 --> 01:37:38.404]  So he changed the law under judicial tyranny right there on the spot?
[01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:05.964]  Well, yes, a woman judge, Judge Casey Rogers, I think that was wrong to change the law.
[01:38:07.846 --> 01:38:09.567]  And so the jury, of course, found us guilty.
[01:38:09.587 --> 01:38:10.628]  Well, yeah, they took out less than $10,000.
[01:38:10.668 --> 01:38:13.171]  You know, go to the bank, take out $10.
[01:38:13.511 --> 01:38:14.191]  That's less than $10,000.
[01:38:15.312 --> 01:38:16.153]  So, guilty.
[01:38:16.714 --> 01:38:26.142]  Then the judge said, now, all that money that was withdrawn, even though you stopped doing this three years ago, all that money that was withdrawn over those years, you now owe it to the government.
[01:38:26.202 --> 01:38:27.223]  They're going to seize that money.
[01:38:28.533 --> 01:38:28.633]  Sure.
[01:38:49.369 --> 01:38:52.452]  And sir, in the time we have with you, we know you're totally innocent.
[01:38:52.472 --> 01:38:56.176]  The New York Times, they had hearings last month that the law says $10,000.
[01:38:56.436 --> 01:39:09.048]  They're going after 86-year-old women with no criminal record who run tiny diners that seat 10 people who would make cash deposits every day of less than $1,000 and then would write checks on that.
[01:39:09.088 --> 01:39:12.451]  They called depositing it structuring and money laundering.
[01:39:13.012 --> 01:39:15.054]  They do whatever they want outside of law.
[01:39:15.474 --> 01:39:16.395]  It's all admitted.
[01:39:16.536 --> 01:39:17.376]  You should be released.
[01:39:17.396 --> 01:39:19.278]  They've overturned other cases like yours.
[01:39:19.599 --> 01:39:20.600]  Here's the big question.
[01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:23.723]  Why did they target you, obviously to shut you down?
[01:39:24.103 --> 01:39:26.606]  What do you think of the massive persecution of the church now?
[01:39:27.066 --> 01:39:31.811]  It's meant to intimidate the church into submitting, going under government faith-based initiative, in my view.
[01:39:32.131 --> 01:39:36.796]  Give us your take on that, and then B, how do we free Kent Hovind?
[01:39:39.913 --> 01:39:45.718]  Yes, there are plenty of websites, freekenthoven.com, it's H-O-V-I-N-D, Norwegian name, Hoven.
[01:39:46.599 --> 01:39:49.742]  Congress needs to repeal that stupid structuring law.
[01:39:49.802 --> 01:39:54.006]  They need to get a lot of pressure to say, look, IRS apologized for misusing it.
[01:39:54.066 --> 01:39:56.268]  Well, that's step one, but that's nowhere close to enough.
[01:39:56.708 --> 01:40:01.393]  Get Congress to repeal the stupid law, and very important, make it retroactive.
[01:40:02.259 --> 01:40:12.228]  And say, okay, anybody ever arrested under this stupid law is hereby released, and all money taken from them is hereby returned, and they get a million dollars for every year of false incarceration.
[01:40:12.248 --> 01:40:14.890]  This call is from the Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office.
[01:40:15.851 --> 01:40:19.274]  I've been locked up over 100 months away from my family.
[01:40:19.314 --> 01:40:21.816]  I've been moved 23 times all over the country.
[01:40:21.856 --> 01:40:22.677]  Diesel therapy.
[01:40:23.057 --> 01:40:23.918]  Trying to shut me up.
[01:40:24.439 --> 01:40:26.140]  I am an outspoken Christian.
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:29.203]  I believe the Bible is literally true and scientifically accurate.
[01:40:29.628 --> 01:40:29.848]  I think?
[01:40:44.013 --> 01:40:45.854]  They are totalitarian scum.
[01:40:45.874 --> 01:40:46.615]  This just proves it.
[01:40:46.815 --> 01:41:04.447]  They're the opposite of liberals, and your case, you're such a gentleman, you're so sweet, you reached a billion people, you were a superstar, who was very humble, you just come across as a total Boy Scout, and to see an innocent man persecuted like this makes me sick.
[01:41:04.567 --> 01:41:11.011]  And these churches have been intimidated by this type of stuff to submit to the government now, and even teach what the government says.
[01:41:11.151 --> 01:41:12.132]  It is disgusting.
[01:41:14.096 --> 01:41:14.737]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:41:14.757 --> 01:41:26.246]  To make it even worse, to make it even worse, a year ago I filed a perfectly legitimate lawsuit against the Bureau of Prisons for keeping my legal box and hindering me from filing my motions.
[01:41:26.846 --> 01:41:33.051]  And I filed a perfectly lawful Liz Pendon, the litigation pending, which says, hey, because they wanted to sell the church property.
[01:41:33.452 --> 01:41:33.812]  They did.
[01:41:33.832 --> 01:41:34.613]  They already did.
[01:41:34.793 --> 01:41:37.715]  And now they're coming after you for pro se activity.
[01:41:37.895 --> 01:41:38.676]  Tell folks about that.
[01:41:40.677 --> 01:41:43.680]  Yeah, they wanted, I just finished trial last Friday.
[01:41:44.364 --> 01:41:55.350]  Uh, they came after me again, a two-week trial, saying, you, uh, face another hundred years in prison for filing this Liz pendant and for contempt of court, which is insane.
[01:41:55.810 --> 01:41:58.592]  The jury was a hung jury on every count except for one.
[01:41:58.652 --> 01:42:02.474]  They did find me guilty of contempt of court of a 2007 order.
[01:42:02.974 --> 01:42:06.176]  And my attorney is putting in a motion saying, look, there was no law on that.
[01:42:07.455 --> 01:42:09.397]  Will you ever get out of prison?
[01:42:09.517 --> 01:42:11.659]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:13.901]  How long have you been in prison?
[01:42:13.941 --> 01:42:14.922]  How long will they keep you?
[01:42:14.942 --> 01:42:16.284]  They just keep trying to pile it up.
[01:42:16.544 --> 01:42:17.785]  What happened in the Newcourt case?
[01:42:19.687 --> 01:42:23.991]  Well, the Newcourt case, it was a hung jury on everything except one count when I was found guilty.
[01:42:27.154 --> 01:42:30.578]  And that one carries anywhere from nothing to there's no limit.
[01:42:30.858 --> 01:42:31.919]  A hundred years, I suppose.
[01:42:32.546 --> 01:42:34.727]  Contempt of court, which what on earth is that?
[01:42:35.188 --> 01:42:38.170]  So we're working now to get that jury verdict overturned.
[01:42:38.190 --> 01:42:39.691]  Who knows?
[01:42:39.771 --> 01:42:48.837]  I was supposed to go home last month from this last charge, but I've been sitting in a county jail with 11 guys sleeping on the floor for 10 months now.
[01:42:51.338 --> 01:42:54.419]  Well, I had Michael Allison on a few years ago.
[01:42:54.839 --> 01:42:59.900]  He was facing life in prison for filming the police and taping the police on his own property.
[01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:03.541]  And the state actually tried to get him life in prison for that.
[01:43:03.561 --> 01:43:05.721]  I mean, this is totalitarianism, is it not?
[01:43:07.942 --> 01:43:08.942]  It is, indeed.
[01:43:08.982 --> 01:43:14.323]  And Edmund Burke said, all that's needed for evil men to triumph is for good men to do nothing.
[01:43:14.363 --> 01:43:16.643]  And we've got... This is America, for heaven's sake.
[01:43:16.683 --> 01:43:17.424]  We've got freedom.
[01:43:17.444 --> 01:43:19.644]  We need to take advantage of the freedoms and use it.
[01:43:20.276 --> 01:43:22.277]  Right now, Congress can change all this.
[01:43:22.397 --> 01:43:25.239]  Congress created this club that they're clubbing everybody with.
[01:43:25.639 --> 01:43:26.259]  Take it away.
[01:43:26.759 --> 01:43:35.684]  Congress should pass a law that says no one involved in law enforcement at any level, judges, lawyers, etc., should be allowed to own stock in the prison system.
[01:43:36.244 --> 01:43:36.504]  That's right.
[01:43:36.544 --> 01:43:37.025]  It's profit.
[01:43:37.085 --> 01:43:37.885]  It's double dipping.
[01:43:38.645 --> 01:43:40.606]  The longer they lock you away, the more money they make.
[01:43:41.007 --> 01:43:43.688]  I wrote a book about this under a different name called The Kennel.
[01:43:44.748 --> 01:43:46.950]  It's up on lulu.com and on 2peter3.com.
[01:43:48.563 --> 01:43:49.883]  It exposes the evil.
[01:43:50.243 --> 01:43:53.704]  All I do, like Jeremiah the prophet, is just simply expose the truth.
[01:43:53.784 --> 01:43:56.644]  Here's what's happening, and boy, they hate the light.
[01:43:57.084 --> 01:43:58.185]  Evil men hate the light.
[01:43:58.205 --> 01:43:59.885]  Well, you're a very righteous man.
[01:43:59.905 --> 01:44:02.305]  I mean, people can pick up on that.
[01:44:02.345 --> 01:44:06.506]  You're just a straightforward Jimmy Stewart, you know, type guy.
[01:44:06.546 --> 01:44:07.326]  That's how you come off.
[01:44:07.366 --> 01:44:12.067]  They cannot stand you because you are a leader, Ken, and you're a hero.
[01:44:12.127 --> 01:44:16.088]  It hurts my heart, though, to think about how they've tortured you and de-sealed you.
[01:44:16.448 --> 01:44:17.908]  Tell folks what they've done to you.
[01:44:20.489 --> 01:44:22.771]  Well, like I said, I've been moved 23 times.
[01:44:22.931 --> 01:44:24.092]  I was moved to Colorado.
[01:44:24.172 --> 01:44:25.413]  I live in Pensacola, Florida.
[01:44:25.433 --> 01:44:27.895]  You're supposed to stay within 500 miles of your home.
[01:44:28.055 --> 01:44:32.138]  Well, I was moved out to Colorado against my will, and then moved up to New Hampshire against my will.
[01:44:32.618 --> 01:44:35.000]  I was moved down to Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery.
[01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:37.602]  I was only there four days, and they took me out and never told me why.
[01:44:38.223 --> 01:44:39.164]  Put me in county jail.
[01:44:39.544 --> 01:44:43.327]  It's been... Excuse me, diesel therapy.
[01:44:43.769 --> 01:44:44.549]  But God's been good.
[01:44:44.589 --> 01:44:45.790]  I've written 37 books.
[01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:48.211]  I've led over 700 men to Christ.
[01:44:49.212 --> 01:44:52.834]  Half the Bible is written from prison or by people who've been in captivity or prison.
[01:44:52.854 --> 01:44:54.035]  So God uses it.
[01:44:54.375 --> 01:44:55.756]  It's coming to everybody.
[01:44:55.856 --> 01:44:57.857]  If you stand true for the Lord, it's coming.
[01:44:57.897 --> 01:44:59.217]  So just get ready for it.
[01:45:00.738 --> 01:45:02.719]  It's been a blessing in a thousand ways.
[01:45:02.879 --> 01:45:03.540]  It's been hard.
[01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:07.022]  I have an eight-year-old grandson that I've never held in freedom.
[01:45:07.262 --> 01:45:07.522]  Never.
[01:45:08.323 --> 01:45:10.325]  I was born two months after I came to prison.
[01:45:11.086 --> 01:45:13.008]  I should have gone home last month.
[01:45:13.068 --> 01:45:16.151]  I could go home today if they overturned this one count.
[01:45:16.911 --> 01:45:20.895]  But... Please call us from the Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office.
[01:45:22.217 --> 01:45:23.158]  Yeah, I love the Lord.
[01:45:23.218 --> 01:45:24.058]  I love my country.
[01:45:24.118 --> 01:45:24.859]  I'm trying to help.
[01:45:24.979 --> 01:45:28.423]  And I think all the stuff we have posted on Two Feet or Three would help.
[01:45:28.483 --> 01:45:31.686]  The things people... These people... The thing they fear the most is light.
[01:45:32.259 --> 01:45:36.321]  And all Gideon had in the book of Judges was two weapons, light and noise.
[01:45:36.601 --> 01:45:40.223]  Shine the light, make a lot of noise, and the enemies started fighting each other.
[01:45:40.984 --> 01:45:41.924]  That's what I'm praying here.
[01:45:41.984 --> 01:45:46.306]  The IRS agents in my case need to be completely investigated, start to finish.
[01:45:47.347 --> 01:45:49.488]  The judges need to be completely investigated.
[01:45:49.588 --> 01:45:51.089]  If they did nothing wrong, okay.
[01:45:51.129 --> 01:45:54.771]  But Congress impeaches judges if they don't rule according to good behavior.
[01:45:55.151 --> 01:45:56.052]  They rarely do that.
[01:45:57.252 --> 01:46:00.614]  But the Constitution says they're appointed for life during good behavior.
[01:46:03.177 --> 01:46:16.081]  Well kid, I get tears in my eyes, not so much for you, but for all the other innocents they're persecuting, for the unborn, for the fact of how they don't have death lists for our veterans of Do Not Treat, and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:46:16.421 --> 01:46:18.041]  The evil is intensifying.
[01:46:18.601 --> 01:46:20.642]  Is our country beginning to come under judgment?
[01:46:23.963 --> 01:46:24.883]  I fear it is, brother.
[01:46:24.963 --> 01:46:28.244]  If any country ever deserved the judgment of God, it's America.
[01:46:28.504 --> 01:46:30.085]  We had a wonderful founding,
[01:46:32.262 --> 01:46:43.027]  Amazing blessings from God and we have spit in his face and we've done so many things against his law that I fear, well, the Bible says, for the transgression of the land, many are the princes thereof.
[01:46:43.467 --> 01:46:46.108]  Because we're wicked, we've got this huge bureaucracy.
[01:46:46.728 --> 01:46:48.369]  So God's giving us what we deserve.
[01:46:49.264 --> 01:46:50.265]  And it's sad.
[01:46:51.066 --> 01:46:53.168]  I appreciate what you guys do to try to turn it around.
[01:46:53.508 --> 01:46:54.549]  I'm in the same boat.
[01:46:54.589 --> 01:46:58.532]  I think righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.
[01:46:59.093 --> 01:47:03.317]  All I've ever tried to do for 46 years is win souls and tell people, live for God.
[01:47:04.017 --> 01:47:05.659]  You have 60 seconds remaining.
[01:47:06.479 --> 01:47:09.482]  You have 60 seconds, Kit, there from your political prison.
[01:47:09.682 --> 01:47:10.663]  You've got 60 seconds.
[01:47:10.703 --> 01:47:11.304]  Final words.
[01:47:13.607 --> 01:47:16.708]  Okay, what people can do is deluge Congress.
[01:47:16.748 --> 01:47:24.132]  Now this judge has said, please write to me and let me know what you think about Kent Hovind, should this, you know, on this one count he was found guilty of.
[01:47:24.552 --> 01:47:34.596]  I don't know that it'll make any difference, but Judge Casey Rogers, number one, North Talifox, T-A-L-A-F-O-X, in Pensacola, 32501.
[01:47:37.598 --> 01:47:40.559]  And just say, Judge Rogers, please, let Kent go home.
[01:47:41.019 --> 01:47:42.960]  It's been 100 months, just go home.
[01:47:43.587 --> 01:47:44.928]  We still think we're going to win the case.
[01:47:44.968 --> 01:47:49.193]  We can always go on appeal, but Congress needs to stop some of these stupid laws.
[01:47:49.233 --> 01:47:50.954]  They need to simply abolish the IRS.
[01:47:51.195 --> 01:47:52.156]  What do we need them for?
[01:47:52.596 --> 01:47:53.337]  Just shut them down.
[01:47:54.038 --> 01:47:55.499]  We didn't have them until 1933.
[01:47:55.619 --> 01:47:56.740]  Just stop, okay?
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:58.682]  But if not, at least investigate them.
[01:47:58.702 --> 01:48:00.164]  Look what they did in my case.
[01:48:00.424 --> 01:48:03.347]  Classic example of everything going wrong with our justice system.
[01:48:05.549 --> 01:48:11.291]  And there you go, he's now back sleeping on the floor in a giant mass of stinking inmates.
[01:48:12.091 --> 01:48:14.712]  And I don't say they're stinking people, you just know it stinks in there.
[01:48:15.552 --> 01:48:18.873]  And a guy with no criminal record, school teacher, did nothing wrong.
[01:48:19.053 --> 01:48:23.134]  And the so-called left, it's why I detest them.
[01:48:24.375 --> 01:48:28.616]  They are the opposite of a liberal, the opposite of Thomas Jefferson, the opposite of freedom.
[01:48:31.624 --> 01:48:35.885]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:48:36.305 --> 01:48:37.625]  That's how the First Amendment begins.
[01:48:38.846 --> 01:48:47.828]  You've got a preacher who was successful, who they feared, who was getting really big, and he wasn't even making a lot of money.
[01:48:51.269 --> 01:48:55.450]  He took $400,000 out for the entire ministry over two years.
[01:48:56.653 --> 01:49:00.237]  Folks, he had films that were selling millions of copies.
[01:49:00.997 --> 01:49:03.059]  He was airing them for free all over the world.
[01:49:04.281 --> 01:49:09.566]  He had different groups giving them out free, wasn't charging in many cases, books for children.
[01:49:09.966 --> 01:49:13.670]  It's the First Amendment, and the left didn't like it, so they put him in prison.
[01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:16.153]  They'll put everybody in prison!
[01:49:17.534 --> 01:49:18.835]  They're not playing games.
[01:49:18.855 --> 01:49:20.956]  Do we still have Mark Adams sitting there listening to that?
[01:49:21.537 --> 01:49:22.257]  He's on the line, sir.
[01:49:22.577 --> 01:49:25.179]  Mark, I mean, I literally got tears in my eyes hearing that.
[01:49:25.259 --> 01:49:29.822]  Not so much for Kent Hovind, but it was how cheerful he was and how nice he sounded.
[01:49:30.522 --> 01:49:33.945]  Sounded like, you know, Jimmy Stewart in It's a Beautiful Life, or Wonderful Life.
[01:49:34.745 --> 01:49:43.229]  But just to know that they're doing this now to thousands of people, and on MSNBC they brag and say, yeah, we're arresting people for their speech.
[01:49:43.530 --> 01:49:44.970]  We're going to shut the Tea Party down.
[01:49:45.330 --> 01:49:49.693]  I mean, these people are brazen, totalitarian, flaming crooks.
[01:49:50.173 --> 01:49:51.934]  They're not even liberals.
[01:49:52.274 --> 01:49:53.435]  They're dangerous.
[01:49:54.115 --> 01:49:55.015]  They're dangerous.
[01:49:55.075 --> 01:49:57.857]  Final comments on the Kent Hovind situation, Mark.
[01:49:58.951 --> 01:50:04.033]  Well, Alex, you just referred to the stench of the prison complex that Dr. Hovind is subjected to.
[01:50:05.093 --> 01:50:12.756]  Speaking of foul stenches, one of the prosecutors in Pastor Hovind's first trial was U.S.
[01:50:12.816 --> 01:50:14.957]  Attorney John Atkinson.
[01:50:16.057 --> 01:50:23.499]  He's the one who is reported to have vigorously pursued a federal indictment against Dr. Hovind.
[01:50:25.799 --> 01:50:28.000]  Hobbit was convicted in January 2007.
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:33.501]  Shortly after his conviction, the U.S.
[01:50:33.561 --> 01:50:42.963]  attorney, John Atchison, assumed room temperature when he voluntarily removed himself from the gene pool.
[01:50:43.423 --> 01:50:44.224]  Here's what happened.
[01:50:44.464 --> 01:50:45.684]  We're going to talk about it when we come back.
[01:50:45.704 --> 01:50:46.284]  I forgot this.
[01:50:46.324 --> 01:50:50.965]  The guy that went after him, this is the cult, was going to have sex with a little girl.
[01:50:51.025 --> 01:50:51.865]  I forgot about that.
[01:50:51.885 --> 01:50:53.786]  Oh my gosh, you can't make this stuff up.
[01:50:54.653 --> 01:50:56.915]  We just put up the Wikipedia, we'll put up articles about it.
[01:50:56.995 --> 01:51:00.438]  We're gonna finish up another segment with Mark Adams.
[01:51:00.838 --> 01:51:02.759]  It's just, it's scary folks.
[01:51:03.540 --> 01:51:05.942]  And it's evil demons like that using the system.
[01:51:06.442 --> 01:51:07.944]  It's not even the whole system itself.

[01:52:18.797 --> 01:52:24.021]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.

[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:10.082]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:53:10.322 --> 01:53:13.645]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:53:13.945 --> 01:53:14.926]  A pair of scissors.
[01:53:15.306 --> 01:53:20.811]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[01:53:21.091 --> 01:53:25.775]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:53:26.015 --> 01:53:26.836]  The phone line.
[01:53:27.016 --> 01:53:31.920]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:53:32.261 --> 01:53:36.004]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:53:36.164 --> 01:53:39.047]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[01:53:39.467 --> 01:53:41.729]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:46.134]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[01:53:46.294 --> 01:53:47.175]  Scissors can't cut it.

[01:54:09.371 --> 01:54:17.697]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, as we broadcast worldwide tons of news.
[01:54:18.277 --> 01:54:22.200]  They're back with the ammo ban and more as we continue to raise the alarm
[01:54:23.792 --> 01:54:24.813]  We're free people everywhere.
[01:54:24.993 --> 01:54:33.261]  In the third hour, we'll also open the phones up on any of the subjects, including Kent Hovind and what we just broke down earlier with him on air.
[01:54:34.482 --> 01:54:45.131]  Mark Adams is a champion and working with the former Congressman Henson, who's too ill to go on air to write a book and expose all of this, but there's hearings in Congress.
[01:54:45.712 --> 01:54:46.713]  This stuff is serious.
[01:54:46.773 --> 01:54:48.955]  The IRS admits they put innocent people in prison.
[01:54:50.282 --> 01:54:57.228]  They claim they're going to stop, not until the private Federal Reserve is not running it, not until political operatives can't do this.
[01:54:58.149 --> 01:55:08.297]  I had forgotten that the prosecutor in the case of Hovind and others, well we'll get to that in a moment, it's just too incredible.
[01:55:09.638 --> 01:55:14.563]  John David Roy Atchison was US Attorney in Florida's Northern District.
[01:55:15.416 --> 01:55:21.018]  assistant attorney who gained notoriety when he was arrested on suspicion of soliciting sex from a five-year-old girl.
[01:55:22.719 --> 01:55:25.400]  So we'll talk about that briefly in a moment and put bookends on this.
[01:55:25.460 --> 01:55:28.181]  That's the type of folks that want to put innocent preachers in jail.
[01:55:29.021 --> 01:55:32.722]  Boy, I feel sorry for his soul right now, let me tell you.
[01:55:34.043 --> 01:55:37.704]  But, continuing, please support the broadcast.
[01:55:37.804 --> 01:55:39.105]  We stand in the face of the enemy.
[01:55:39.725 --> 01:55:40.745]  And I'm not whining about it.
[01:55:41.105 --> 01:55:42.366]  Every fiber of me wants to just
[01:55:43.474 --> 01:55:44.095]  Fight tyranny.
[01:55:44.135 --> 01:55:44.975]  I'm so sick of it.
[01:55:45.015 --> 01:55:49.258]  I'm so sick of parasites and scum and evil people hurting good people.
[01:55:50.018 --> 01:55:52.500]  But it is your financial support that makes it all possible.
[01:55:52.520 --> 01:56:00.826]  And you've got a commitment from me that I will fight as hard as I possibly can and put my whole will towards warning people about the entire spectrum of evil coming down on this world.
[01:56:01.526 --> 01:56:05.228]  But we need you to buy the products at Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.

[01:57:04.146 --> 01:57:06.467]  But it really is epic, Mark.
[01:57:06.867 --> 01:57:11.331]  When you get into reality, I've forgotten the group of scum that convicted him.
[01:57:11.891 --> 01:57:22.319]  Tell us in the minute or two we have left, because it's in the news, about the gentleman that was persecuting Dr. Kent Hovind, Mark Adams.
[01:57:23.342 --> 01:57:26.564]  Yes, John Atkinson, the U.S.
[01:57:26.645 --> 01:57:27.065]  Attorney.
[01:57:27.685 --> 01:57:39.915]  It was on September 16, 2007, about eight months after he railroaded Pastor Hovind to prison, he was arrested at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport.
[01:57:40.835 --> 01:57:46.640]  He flew to there from Georgia to solicit sex from a five-year-old girl.
[01:57:47.657 --> 01:57:51.119]  And according to the news accounts, he bought her some presents.
[01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:59.105]  He had a doll, he had a pair of earrings, and he also had a jar of petroleum jelly in his possession.
[01:57:59.125 --> 01:57:59.625]  Oh my goodness.
[01:58:01.366 --> 01:58:08.551]  And it was the next month, October 2007, he committed suicide by hanging himself in his prison cell.
[01:58:10.336 --> 01:58:14.058]  And we always hear about these Homeland Security guys trying to get on planes and have sex with kids.
[01:58:14.098 --> 01:58:15.119]  I mean, it's truly sick.
[01:58:15.539 --> 01:58:17.480]  There's a large guild of them in there, we know.
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:19.061]  And of course, I apologize.
[01:58:19.101 --> 01:58:20.161]  I'm teleprompter-free.
[01:58:20.221 --> 01:58:21.942]  I'm always fighting tyranny, so I forget things.
[01:58:22.363 --> 01:58:23.543]  And I apologize, everybody.
[01:58:23.583 --> 01:58:25.144]  Congressman Hanson died last year.
[01:58:25.164 --> 01:58:27.906]  I remember when he couldn't come on about two years ago, so you came on.
[01:58:27.926 --> 01:58:28.666]  I didn't know he died.
[01:58:28.746 --> 01:58:30.427]  So, Mark, I apologize for that.
[01:58:30.467 --> 01:58:31.147]  What a great man.
[01:58:31.428 --> 01:58:35.530]  We should have you back on soon to eulogize Mr. Hanson, Congressman Hanson.
[01:58:36.553 --> 01:58:37.794]  Thank you for the air time, Alex.
[01:58:37.955 --> 01:58:38.255]  You bet.
[01:58:38.295 --> 01:58:39.376]  Yeah, I didn't even know that.
[01:58:39.396 --> 01:58:43.020]  It's just so many great men have fallen and I'm just too busy on the front line.
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:46.284]  It's like the Alamo swinging muskets to even pay attention.
[01:58:46.364 --> 01:58:47.405]  So I apologize for that.
[01:58:47.425 --> 01:58:47.946]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:47.966 --> 01:58:48.406]  Stay with us.
[01:58:48.667 --> 01:58:49.387]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:58:49.407 --> 01:58:50.469]  We'll get the number out of your calls.
[01:58:50.489 --> 01:58:53.692]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:59.236 --> 01:59:08.759]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:59:08.899 --> 01:59:18.642]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:59:18.822 --> 01:59:21.743]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:59:21.943 --> 01:59:22.563]  I think so.
[01:59:44.548 --> 01:59:49.750]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.

[01:59:55.872 --> 01:59:57.372]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:15.117 --> 02:00:19.279]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:19.959 --> 02:00:20.759]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.540 --> 02:00:22.440]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.081 --> 02:00:26.722]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.282 --> 02:00:31.344]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:38.969 --> 02:00:40.631]  Well, the Northeast is freezing.
[02:00:40.731 --> 02:00:43.493]  Record cold temperatures continue in Boston and New York.
[02:00:44.014 --> 02:00:45.515]  And Chicago got their spring.
[02:00:46.256 --> 02:00:48.778]  Groundhog didn't get scared, I guess, there.
[02:00:49.098 --> 02:00:49.578]  77 degrees.
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:52.581]  I'll take some of that weather down here in Austin.
[02:00:53.162 --> 02:00:57.886]  Been unseasonably cold, but if I just would have paid Al Gore money, everything would have been alright.
[02:00:59.653 --> 02:01:02.460]  We've already covered just massive amounts of news.
[02:01:03.282 --> 02:01:08.735]  And that whole Kent Hovind interview really upset me because I followed that case off and on the last decade.
[02:01:10.506 --> 02:01:25.792]  And I've caught HBO shows and Comedy Central and MSNBC just loving the fact he's in prison and going, can you believe he had a park where kids could go on dinosaur rides and where they claim that there were dinosaurs in the time of Adam and Eve.
[02:01:26.092 --> 02:01:27.633]  Thank God he's in jail.
[02:01:28.373 --> 02:01:30.214]  He was running scams and keeping money.
[02:01:31.675 --> 02:01:31.695]  501c3.
[02:01:34.758 --> 02:01:37.339]  I wouldn't care if the guy lived in a huge mansion putting out important information.
[02:01:37.359 --> 02:01:38.779]  He lived in a little house and had a van.
[02:01:39.319 --> 02:01:40.859]  They hated him because he was so good, man.
[02:01:41.699 --> 02:01:43.440]  That guy's so good compared to somebody like me.
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:45.200]  Makes me sick.
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:59.723]  I don't, it's just, let me tell you something, and I meant to say that, and I was going to say, you do bad things to really good men, judgment comes down on you really quick, and I didn't even know or remember that the prosecutor was a pedophile that killed themselves.
[02:02:01.749 --> 02:02:05.393]  I remember covering that in the news at the time and not even knowing that it was the prosecutor for him.
[02:02:05.413 --> 02:02:11.400]  And I've seen so many cases where these sicko prosecutors are like hardcore liberals.
[02:02:12.902 --> 02:02:14.224]  And pedophiles and stuff.
[02:02:14.284 --> 02:02:15.445]  I mean, they're just sick.
[02:02:16.306 --> 02:02:17.387]  And they're in the system.
[02:02:17.628 --> 02:02:19.730]  You might get a great judge, you might get a horrible judge.
[02:02:20.111 --> 02:02:21.392]  That's why I want to be careful here.
[02:02:24.031 --> 02:02:26.272]  It's not even the government itself that's bad.
[02:02:26.372 --> 02:02:28.732]  It's alien institutions like the Federal Reserve.
[02:02:29.372 --> 02:02:32.453]  It's out-of-control bureaucracies like the FCC and the Justice Department.
[02:02:34.293 --> 02:02:43.236]  It's some of these federal prosecutors, but then I've met other federal prosecutors that are doing a great job, and I see them doing great things, and going after big banks and stuff, and then they die in a car wreck.
[02:02:44.336 --> 02:02:46.036]  Not somebody I knew, but I've seen cases of that.
[02:02:48.237 --> 02:02:52.658]  So fighting for good, you can get killed too, but it's honorable for them to kill you,
[02:02:53.888 --> 02:02:55.249]  It's not honorable to be a pedophile.
[02:02:56.831 --> 02:02:58.152]  So it's a war, folks.
[02:02:58.172 --> 02:03:03.216]  There's just a war between good and evil going on, and each and one of us, every one of us, it's in our heart.
[02:03:03.917 --> 02:03:06.359]  The battle is going on in our hearts and minds.
[02:03:06.719 --> 02:03:12.604]  It's a battle of hearts and minds in the final equation, and I just am God-fearing.
[02:03:12.765 --> 02:03:14.126]  I want to be good.
[02:03:14.146 --> 02:03:17.909]  I want to be around people that are good.
[02:03:17.929 --> 02:03:19.651]  I want to be involved in justice.
[02:03:20.854 --> 02:03:22.655]  I want to be involved in helping little people.
[02:03:23.156 --> 02:03:26.118]  I want to be involved in empowering humanity, not suckering humanity.
[02:03:26.818 --> 02:03:29.540]  And I grew up thinking everybody was like me.
[02:03:31.482 --> 02:03:33.083]  And I learned, no, a lot of folks aren't like that.
[02:03:34.124 --> 02:03:36.165]  They enjoy screwing over stupid people.
[02:03:37.246 --> 02:03:44.071]  I was never the kind of kid in the neighborhood when I was like 12 or 13 that would get the nine-year-old kid who wanted to go out and, you know, hang out with the older kids and beat them up.
[02:03:45.285 --> 02:03:48.827]  Or tell them, go rob beer out of that garage over there.
[02:03:48.887 --> 02:03:53.249]  We're gonna beat you up, or humiliate people.
[02:03:53.909 --> 02:03:56.450]  I always wanted to empower people and build people up.
[02:03:58.231 --> 02:04:05.734]  Those of us that do have a heart that loves justice, we're blind to evil because we just can't imagine that people have it out for us.
[02:04:05.774 --> 02:04:06.875]  Well, we gotta grow up.
[02:04:08.075 --> 02:04:09.556]  And you gotta get angry at these people.
[02:04:10.116 --> 02:04:11.357]  And stop having fear of them.
[02:04:12.236 --> 02:04:19.000]  Get angry, know that they're going to go down on the end, and just get your heart right and your soul right, because I'm not worried about he that can kill my body.
[02:04:19.460 --> 02:04:20.701]  I'm worried about my soul.
[02:04:20.721 --> 02:04:33.449]  That's been said many times in many different ways, but what a parable of imprisoning this innocent man, and I'm sure so many others, and this federal prosecutor,
[02:04:35.230 --> 02:04:43.335]  He gets caught in his own web of pedophilia, and it's the very same Jocelyn Elders Democrats, and in Europe they're trying to legalize pedophilia.
[02:04:43.975 --> 02:04:55.242]  See, that's why they don't want any morals, is so they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, and they see somebody righteous, like Kent Hovind, and it just absolutely outrages them.
[02:04:55.643 --> 02:05:02.507]  I mean, even if you don't believe what Kent believes, Dr. Hovind believes, still you can see he's an honorable man.
[02:05:04.192 --> 02:05:05.493]  At least he's not a eugenicist.
[02:05:06.574 --> 02:05:07.015]  We'll be back.
[02:05:07.035 --> 02:05:07.375]  Stay with us.
[02:05:07.615 --> 02:05:08.156]  Get the number up.
[02:05:09.036 --> 02:05:09.897]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:05:09.997 --> 02:05:10.398]  Good, brother.
[02:05:10.558 --> 02:05:12.219]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:05:12.279 --> 02:05:14.061]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:05:14.221 --> 02:05:18.285]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:05:18.305 --> 02:05:20.827]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:05:20.887 --> 02:05:23.109]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:05:23.309 --> 02:05:29.735]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of
[02:05:29.955 --> 02:05:34.582]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:05:34.702 --> 02:05:36.224]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:05:36.244 --> 02:05:40.591]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[02:05:44.957 --> 02:05:46.038]  We're good to go.
[02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:12.062]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:06:12.362 --> 02:06:20.367]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:06:20.607 --> 02:06:25.631]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:06:26.031 --> 02:06:28.312]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:06:28.552 --> 02:06:30.334]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:07:08.672 --> 02:07:17.375]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[02:07:17.675 --> 02:07:27.638]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[02:07:28.198 --> 02:07:34.300]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:40.782]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:07:41.022 --> 02:07:45.964]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most
[02:07:45.964 --> 02:07:46.404]  We're good.
[02:08:19.995 --> 02:08:23.858]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:08:24.819 --> 02:08:26.240]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:27.641]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:28.161 --> 02:08:33.965]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:35.666 --> 02:08:36.527]  I know there's a war.
[02:08:38.949 --> 02:08:40.310]  I know what the stakes are.
[02:08:41.911 --> 02:08:45.754]  And if we can just get the public out of that trance for a minute to wake up and look around them...
[02:08:46.820 --> 02:08:52.544]  They're gonna realize how far down the rabbit hole we've gone, and they're gonna get concerned, and then they're gonna start wanting to know more.
[02:08:55.505 --> 02:09:07.253]  We can free the hearts and minds out there not to believe what we believe, not to see what we see, but just to open their minds, open their eyeballs, their ears up, their smell, their taste, their touch.
[02:09:09.854 --> 02:09:13.857]  Because boy, when you are awake, it is wild!
[02:09:15.336 --> 02:09:19.878]  And it's crazy to see other people bought into the system, totally unhappy, vapid.
[02:09:19.898 --> 02:09:41.449]  I was driving around downtown yesterday, taking care of business, before I came up to the Sunday Show, meeting with some folks, and I was looking at the South by Southwest crowd, and they looked soulless.
[02:09:42.349 --> 02:09:43.050]  They looked weak.
[02:09:44.673 --> 02:09:56.718]  They looked stupid, they looked aimless, or they had narcissistic weird looks in their eyes like they would stand there with this weird smile on their face looking inward on a power trip.
[02:09:57.239 --> 02:10:00.960]  Like when you're five years old and again imagine you're Batman or Robin or something on a power trip.
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:05.482]  You're meant to do that when you're developing archetypes in your mind, but not when you're an adult.
[02:10:06.042 --> 02:10:08.043]  It's this false media echo chamber.
[02:10:08.764 --> 02:10:09.504]  It's mind control.
[02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:12.091]  I mean, what is mind control?
[02:10:12.111 --> 02:10:26.868]  There's a thousand flavors of it, but if I'm lifting weights, or I'm jogging, or I'm on an elliptical machine, if I listen to high-energy music, it could be Beethoven or ZZ Top, I can go for an hour at 80 or 90
[02:10:31.957 --> 02:10:33.238]  I guess they call it RPMs.
[02:10:34.078 --> 02:10:36.400]  Without it, 30 minutes at 70 and I'm bored.
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:37.981]  That's mind control.
[02:10:38.801 --> 02:10:41.823]  Hardcore music that really touches your mind, touches your soul.
[02:10:42.423 --> 02:10:47.066]  That's why, going back thousands of years, they'd have trumpet blowers and drum beaters for war.
[02:10:47.707 --> 02:10:51.369]  Marching armies up to each other to cut each other to pieces or blast each other to pieces.
[02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:54.811]  That's why in that old, is that a Jimmy Dean song?
[02:10:54.851 --> 02:10:55.612]  Who sings that song?
[02:10:56.292 --> 02:10:58.033]  In 1814, we took a little trip.
[02:10:58.053 --> 02:10:59.294]  I don't think it's Jimmy Dean, it's somebody else.
[02:11:01.926 --> 02:11:09.170]  Along with Colonel Jackson down in the mighty Mississippi, we took a little bacon and we took a little beans, and we fought the bloody British at the town of New Orleans.
[02:11:10.030 --> 02:11:11.851]  They talk about they stepped so high.
[02:11:12.232 --> 02:11:12.712]  Johnny Horton.
[02:11:12.992 --> 02:11:13.552]  Johnny Horton.
[02:11:14.853 --> 02:11:17.034]  Fast away, headed to Louisiana.
[02:11:17.414 --> 02:11:22.217]  And they had, must have been a hundred of them beating on the drum.
[02:11:24.514 --> 02:11:25.054]  What's the words?
[02:11:25.094 --> 02:11:27.676]  They stepped so high you could hear their bugle yell.
[02:11:28.377 --> 02:11:30.458]  And there must have been a hundred of them beating on the drum.
[02:11:30.478 --> 02:11:31.879]  I'm probably butchering the words from memory.
[02:11:32.199 --> 02:11:33.520]  It's all teleprompter free.
[02:11:33.801 --> 02:11:35.682]  Yeah, blow that up for me and I'll actually read it on air.
[02:11:35.882 --> 02:11:36.923]  But I'm going somewhere with this.
[02:11:37.303 --> 02:11:46.009]  They found thousands of years ago men would march into battle and fight in a vicious berserker fashion as long as there was the right beat of a drum going.
[02:11:46.049 --> 02:11:46.650]  That's war.
[02:11:48.030 --> 02:11:51.433]  In 18... whether it was Africa or Ireland.
[02:11:52.312 --> 02:11:55.940]  Whether it was Germania or the Aztec Kingdoms.
[02:11:56.742 --> 02:11:59.087]  Everybody wanted to go into war to the beat of a drum.
[02:11:59.147 --> 02:12:00.089]  That's mind control.
[02:12:00.109 --> 02:12:01.151]  See, and it just goes from there.
[02:12:01.632 --> 02:12:02.835]  Just admit it's happening.
[02:12:04.202 --> 02:12:08.324]  In 1814, we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississippi.
[02:12:08.624 --> 02:12:13.186]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in the town of New Orleans.
[02:12:13.587 --> 02:12:15.628]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[02:12:15.928 --> 02:12:18.389]  There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.
[02:12:18.789 --> 02:12:23.471]  We fired once more and they began to running on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:12:24.792 --> 02:12:26.193]  We looked down a river.
[02:12:27.338 --> 02:12:31.160]  And we see the British come, and there must have been a hundred of them beating on a drum.
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:36.083]  And I guess for about every 200, 300 soldiers, they'd have somebody on the drums.
[02:12:36.103 --> 02:12:37.343]  That was a large army.
[02:12:39.064 --> 02:12:41.545]  They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring.
[02:12:42.166 --> 02:12:44.907]  We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.
[02:12:45.808 --> 02:12:47.889]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[02:12:47.909 --> 02:12:49.790]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[02:12:50.150 --> 02:12:53.972]  We fired once more and they began to run it on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:57.881]  Old Hickory said we could take them by surprise.
[02:12:58.501 --> 02:13:01.262]  We didn't fire muskets till we looked them in the eyes.
[02:13:01.842 --> 02:13:04.423]  We held our fire till we see their faces well.
[02:13:04.783 --> 02:13:07.464]  Then we opened up our squirrel guns and really gave them hell.
[02:13:08.464 --> 02:13:10.805]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[02:13:11.085 --> 02:13:13.166]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[02:13:13.486 --> 02:13:17.787]  We fired once more and they began to run it on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:13:18.387 --> 02:13:21.068]  So just think about the power of a drum.
[02:13:22.529 --> 02:13:23.309]  Humans are humans.
[02:13:25.009 --> 02:13:32.835]  Whether it was ancient Japan, or ancient Africa, or ancient America, from the Native Americans, we're all the same, folks.
[02:13:33.816 --> 02:13:41.281]  And we're being manipulated against each other, using technologies hundreds of times more sophisticated than a drum.
[02:13:42.822 --> 02:13:48.126]  Just be aware of the manipulation, and you've got the intellect and the spirit to trump it.
[02:13:48.607 --> 02:13:54.271]  Because the devil's manipulation is nothing but the devil will force himself and his system on you.
[02:13:56.462 --> 02:13:59.884]  This world system, this predatory system, call it what you want, will force itself.
[02:14:00.265 --> 02:14:00.845]  God won't.
[02:14:01.725 --> 02:14:02.446]  And it's free will.
[02:14:04.187 --> 02:14:07.729]  So if you want to trump the devil, you gotta ask Christ into your heart.
[02:14:08.130 --> 02:14:13.413]  And we've had a lot of complaints by people, but also a lot of positive stuff with me talking about Jesus on air almost every day.
[02:14:13.433 --> 02:14:15.134]  I just talk from the heart.
[02:14:15.575 --> 02:14:17.256]  The enemy is rising up right now.
[02:14:17.776 --> 02:14:19.857]  The enemy is persecuting people worldwide.
[02:14:19.958 --> 02:14:20.918]  It's intensifying.
[02:14:21.358 --> 02:14:23.240]  And my heart gets closer to God.
[02:14:24.625 --> 02:14:27.227]  The more I just prepare myself for what's coming.
[02:14:27.927 --> 02:14:29.368]  And that's just a normal process.
[02:14:29.988 --> 02:14:42.216]  And all you atheists or people out there, if you don't like somebody that has a relationship with a spirit of love and do unto others as you do unto them, if that upsets you so much, you really ought to look at that.
[02:14:42.316 --> 02:14:47.299]  I understand big establishment churches doing the devil's work, meant to discredit Christ.
[02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:49.161]  That's what you don't like.
[02:14:49.641 --> 02:14:50.782]  It's not the true spirit.
[02:14:51.802 --> 02:14:58.104]  And I would challenge atheists and people, and many of them have done this, just to ask God, hey God of your real, show me.
[02:14:59.324 --> 02:15:00.125]  Give me discernment.
[02:15:00.145 --> 02:15:01.405]  Let me see the other side.
[02:15:02.425 --> 02:15:06.547]  Now, careful what you ask for, because all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.
[02:15:06.567 --> 02:15:08.227]  Okay?
[02:15:08.247 --> 02:15:11.448]  Because when you get real discernment, folks, you can really see what's going on.
[02:15:11.968 --> 02:15:13.249]  And I just hope you're ready for it.
[02:15:14.133 --> 02:15:15.054]  A lot of people aren't.
[02:15:15.594 --> 02:15:23.158]  That's why they've brought up a bunch of self-obsessed, arrested development babies out there.
[02:15:23.718 --> 02:15:26.980]  And I don't take some pleasure in the fact that so many men and women are arrested.
[02:15:28.281 --> 02:15:35.144]  I take great pain in that Orwell talked about dumbing language down so much that you couldn't even communicate with the proles.
[02:15:36.925 --> 02:15:38.486]  And that's what we now reach at this point.
[02:15:40.465 --> 02:15:48.254]  And anybody trying to warn them they think that you're a kook or that, you know, that they have power over you because they laugh at you.
[02:15:48.634 --> 02:15:57.244]  You gotta understand, that's like a seriously mentally retarded or brain damaged person standing at a bus stop drooling, laughing at you when you drive by in your car.
[02:15:57.284 --> 02:15:58.285]  You need to feel sorry for them.
[02:15:59.427 --> 02:16:00.127]  It's not funny.
[02:16:01.038 --> 02:16:07.001]  And none of us should take pleasure, and I've done it myself a thousand times or more, calling him sheeple, making fun of people.
[02:16:07.881 --> 02:16:11.063]  Like Mark Dice says, he doesn't go cherry-picked to show stupid people.
[02:16:11.123 --> 02:16:12.424]  That's everyone he talks to.
[02:16:13.064 --> 02:16:14.745]  He talks to ten people, he shows all of them.
[02:16:15.085 --> 02:16:20.748]  And nine out of ten say put gun owners in slave camps, murder everyone, world government, abort children up to age five.
[02:16:20.768 --> 02:16:24.510]  We do similar interviews.
[02:16:24.590 --> 02:16:26.671]  This is what they've done to these people!
[02:16:28.097 --> 02:16:28.817]  They're gone!
[02:16:29.538 --> 02:16:30.298]  They're gone!
[02:16:30.838 --> 02:16:38.282]  They had a soul when they were kids, they were put in front of a TV and brainwashed and brought up by brain-damaged parents, and now they're gone, folks!
[02:16:38.743 --> 02:16:39.283]  They're gone!
[02:16:39.383 --> 02:16:42.785]  I look in their eyes, they got shark eyes, with that little pig smile.
[02:16:43.045 --> 02:16:43.685]  They're gone!
[02:16:43.845 --> 02:16:45.826]  There's a demon in there, running the show!
[02:16:46.187 --> 02:16:46.747]  They're gone!
[02:16:46.767 --> 02:16:48.488]  It's not funny!
[02:16:49.368 --> 02:16:49.909]  They're gone!
[02:16:52.830 --> 02:16:54.271]  And they're gonna tear us apart!
[02:16:56.479 --> 02:16:59.980]  That's why the meme is zombies, zombies, the military training to mow down zombies.
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:01.040]  That's the public.
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:03.841]  But before they kill you, they take your soul.
[02:17:04.341 --> 02:17:06.561]  Before they kill you, they turn you into an animal.
[02:17:07.521 --> 02:17:08.362]  That's metaphysical.
[02:17:08.522 --> 02:17:11.522]  They're not allowed to go after a free man and kill him.
[02:17:11.582 --> 02:17:12.863]  They can imprison you and torture you.
[02:17:12.983 --> 02:17:14.683]  They're not allowed to kill you in most cases.
[02:17:15.823 --> 02:17:18.444]  When they do, it breaks the metaphysical law and blows up in their face.
[02:17:18.704 --> 02:17:24.205]  It's why they can't kill people like the last guest we had on earlier.
[02:17:26.903 --> 02:17:29.027]  They have to torture them and hope they can break their will.
[02:17:30.008 --> 02:17:32.853]  But you notice, they only get stronger under the attack.
[02:17:34.075 --> 02:17:34.937]  This is a battle.
[02:17:35.839 --> 02:17:37.600]  Our spirits are in these earth suits.
[02:17:38.021 --> 02:17:39.061]  We are here being tested.
[02:17:39.442 --> 02:17:41.223]  Think about how epic that is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:41.883 --> 02:17:44.465]  And science has proven that there's an essence beyond the brain.
[02:17:44.485 --> 02:17:51.030]  That's why the enemy says every day in articles, it was out today, that, oh, the science, love discovered, it's only in the brain.
[02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:53.331]  Well, of course it's biological.
[02:17:53.892 --> 02:18:01.577]  The spirit then manifests and resonates through it, and as below, so above, they use the ancient alchemist statement of the enemy.
[02:18:01.737 --> 02:18:02.278]  But it's true.
[02:18:03.388 --> 02:18:05.909]  It's, I've talked about this, it's mirrored levels.
[02:18:07.970 --> 02:18:15.632]  We have a spirit, but we live on through the genetics of our ancestors and we have their archetypal condensed, compressed memories.
[02:18:16.052 --> 02:18:18.493]  So we are partially those that came before us.
[02:18:20.444 --> 02:18:24.345]  And then we have spirits above that, and there's so many levels.
[02:18:24.665 --> 02:18:30.126]  That's why people get confused and go, I'm having these memories of things, and I feel like I've been here forever.
[02:18:30.166 --> 02:18:37.628]  Well, you have that genetic code that's one level of kind of the symbiotic group creature that we are.
[02:18:38.048 --> 02:18:42.969]  Our bodies, our organs, are like a jellyfish that's a symbiotic colony.
[02:18:43.880 --> 02:19:03.209]  Humans are colonies, our bodies are cell colonies, with electromagnetic systems that they admit pick up the literal winds of space, and that are also picking up fourth and fifth dimension resonances, and as scientists look at this, we are basically a bio suit.
[02:19:04.970 --> 02:19:09.492]  But the bio suit itself has experiences, and is alive.
[02:19:10.803 --> 02:19:12.164]  I didn't read this in a book, folks.
[02:19:12.464 --> 02:19:14.344]  I've read all the different scientific components to it.
[02:19:14.664 --> 02:19:16.185]  And then there's other layers to it.
[02:19:16.205 --> 02:19:19.886]  It's just, it's unbelievable how fantastic this is.
[02:19:20.226 --> 02:19:22.547]  And the enemy's trying to poison that and jam it.
[02:19:23.127 --> 02:19:29.289]  Because there's no way, if they can't poison and jam that, there's no way that we're not going to be stopped going to the next level.
[02:19:29.509 --> 02:19:33.030]  The eye has not seen, the ear has not heard what God has in store for us.
[02:19:33.731 --> 02:19:35.471]  But this is a testing ground.
[02:19:35.811 --> 02:19:37.612]  Like boot camp, you can believe it.
[02:19:40.134 --> 02:19:41.214]  You need to get your soul right.
[02:19:41.675 --> 02:19:42.875]  That's what the enemy's coming for.
[02:19:43.935 --> 02:19:45.556]  God, look at the fruits of the New World Order.
[02:19:46.256 --> 02:19:53.758]  Piles of dead bodies, murdered children, stinking prisons, absolute hell on earth and jellyfish wandering around everywhere.
[02:19:54.259 --> 02:19:57.380]  I mean, it's really scary to see these people losing their souls.
[02:19:57.840 --> 02:19:58.780]  To see these zombies.
[02:19:58.800 --> 02:19:59.420]  800-259-9231.
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:19:59.480]  800-259-9231.
[02:19:59.500 --> 02:20:00.020]  Straight ahead.
[02:20:00.140 --> 02:20:01.701]  Your phone calls and a ton of news.
[02:20:09.452 --> 02:20:12.033]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[02:20:12.173 --> 02:20:16.175]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[02:20:16.475 --> 02:20:17.695]  SilverLungs.com.
[02:20:17.875 --> 02:20:20.356]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[02:20:20.556 --> 02:20:23.337]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.

[02:20:25.898 --> 02:20:27.619]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[02:20:27.799 --> 02:20:33.123]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[02:20:33.363 --> 02:20:37.026]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and Lung Delivery System at SilverLungs.com.

[02:21:09.258 --> 02:21:18.043]  As the New World Order continues to tighten its grip on every facet of our lives, we're all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?
[02:21:18.844 --> 02:21:19.944]  The answer is clear.
[02:21:20.405 --> 02:21:22.426]  Get prepared and you get prepared now.
[02:21:23.006 --> 02:21:25.568]  Now the only question left is where do we begin?
[02:21:26.468 --> 02:21:28.270]  My Patreon supply is here to help.

[02:22:08.246 --> 02:22:16.914]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[02:22:17.254 --> 02:22:27.183]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[02:22:27.723 --> 02:22:33.828]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:22:34.149 --> 02:22:40.294]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:22:40.534 --> 02:22:43.197]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[02:22:43.937 --> 02:22:44.237]  We're good.
[02:23:08.173 --> 02:23:09.253]  It's happening again.
[02:23:09.273 --> 02:23:12.534]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[02:23:12.954 --> 02:23:16.135]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[02:23:16.375 --> 02:23:20.196]  378, will take away your right to buy level 3 and higher body armor.
[02:23:20.437 --> 02:23:25.458]  KD Armor offers the most affordable level 3 body armor packages on the market today.
[02:23:25.938 --> 02:23:26.898]  Protect yourself.
[02:23:27.038 --> 02:23:30.139]  Buy your body armor now before it's too late.
[02:23:30.299 --> 02:23:31.780]  Go to KDArmor.com.
[02:23:31.840 --> 02:23:34.440]  That's K-A-T-I-Armor.com.
[02:23:34.821 --> 02:23:35.881]  Come and take it.
[02:23:37.412 --> 02:23:38.713]  Hey, sorry I'm running late.
[02:23:38.833 --> 02:23:40.674]  I had to stop and get my vitamins for the month.
[02:23:40.974 --> 02:23:44.115]  I got mine in the mail yesterday from DiscountNutritionShop.com.
[02:23:44.295 --> 02:23:45.696]  So I'm here, totally on time.
[02:23:46.576 --> 02:23:48.337]  DiscountNutritionShop.com?
[02:23:48.657 --> 02:23:50.978]  Yup, they're a lifesaver in more ways than one.
[02:23:51.218 --> 02:23:55.460]  They have all the nutritional supplements you need, the major brands you know, plus you can save up to 10%.
[02:23:56.441 --> 02:23:57.501]  Write down this number, 888-908-4548.
[02:23:57.541 --> 02:23:57.621]  Huh?
[02:23:57.641 --> 02:23:57.681]  888-908-4548.
[02:23:57.701 --> 02:23:59.342]  Or just go to DiscountNutritionShop.com.
[02:24:09.386 --> 02:24:09.767]  Yeah.
[02:24:16.954 --> 02:24:18.995]  And now the real thing, a lot better than what I was saying.
[02:24:19.015 --> 02:24:22.056]  Coming up... Pedophilia in Britain, woven in the fabric of society.
[02:24:22.136 --> 02:24:24.016]  Israeli vote in the balance as campaigning draws to a close.
[02:24:24.156 --> 02:24:25.317]  Incredible attacks on free speech.
[02:24:44.599 --> 02:24:48.302]  We're going to continue to break all this down and warn people coming up.
[02:24:50.443 --> 02:24:54.226]  Hertz puts cameras in rental cars, says it has no plans to use them.
[02:24:55.667 --> 02:24:58.269]  Like a great white shark has no plans to use its teeth either.
[02:25:00.768 --> 02:25:04.471]  AR-15 ammo ban already back as Dems demand even wider ban.
[02:25:04.491 --> 02:25:06.113]  I just opened the phones up on any subject.
[02:25:06.493 --> 02:25:09.255]  Dominique's wants to talk about DrudgeReport.com.
[02:25:09.295 --> 02:25:13.479]  Yeah, there's an AP article up there that I have in the stack.
[02:25:13.719 --> 02:25:17.723]  One year left of water for California as California turns into a desert.
[02:25:19.605 --> 02:25:20.806]  I guess Drudge is linked to the L.A.
[02:25:20.846 --> 02:25:21.146]  Times.
[02:25:21.206 --> 02:25:23.348]  I saw an AP article about how it's becoming a desert.
[02:25:24.169 --> 02:25:27.812]  Number one, they cut off a bunch of water at Klamath Falls six years ago, seven years ago.
[02:25:29.154 --> 02:25:30.635]  They're cutting the lakes off on purpose.
[02:25:30.675 --> 02:25:37.081]  That dovetails with the plan with the chemtrails spraying the geoengineering out in the Pacific to block rainstorms coming in.
[02:25:37.141 --> 02:25:38.522]  So this is on purpose.
[02:25:38.562 --> 02:25:41.865]  This is economic warfare against California.
[02:25:41.885 --> 02:25:43.307]  I don't know what the master plan is.
[02:25:43.347 --> 02:25:44.187]  You can war game it.
[02:25:44.868 --> 02:25:45.408]  But that's
[02:25:46.371 --> 02:25:47.131]  My take on it.
[02:25:47.192 --> 02:25:48.492]  Dominic, what's your take on it?
[02:25:48.512 --> 02:25:53.435]  Calling from the former state of California, now Globalist Command Base, West Coast.
[02:25:54.656 --> 02:25:57.517]  Yeah, Alex, this is Dominic from Kim Chasers, man.
[02:25:57.537 --> 02:26:00.159]  I wanted to say thanks for having us on the show.
[02:26:00.179 --> 02:26:04.361]  I had no idea that you were going to call in and it was you over the chemtrail angle.
[02:26:04.561 --> 02:26:08.163]  But see, that's my angle because we know the planes spray in front of the weather fronts.
[02:26:08.423 --> 02:26:13.446]  The meteorologists have been on and said they're killing those weather systems that badly needed water.
[02:26:13.486 --> 02:26:14.307]  What do you make of all this?
[02:26:15.833 --> 02:26:18.916]  Two days before every storm that comes in, we see it.
[02:26:19.136 --> 02:26:21.117]  They go heavy and the storm hits it.
[02:26:21.577 --> 02:26:22.058]  No rain.
[02:26:22.898 --> 02:26:25.040]  We just went to Lake Tahoe and shot an episode.
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:27.922]  The lake was four feet down.
[02:26:28.742 --> 02:26:32.985]  The mountains were bare of snow in the middle of February.
[02:26:33.426 --> 02:26:37.448]  And what was on top of the mountains except about 20 chemtrails.
[02:26:38.669 --> 02:26:40.851]  Well, and we've had the father of weather weapons on in 1946.
[02:26:40.891 --> 02:26:41.411]  He was flying into
[02:26:44.346 --> 02:26:48.568]  Well, Pacific Typhoons and Atlantic Hurricanes.
[02:26:49.169 --> 02:26:53.631]  Ben Livingston, and he's the admitted, after we had him on, he was on Fox News, Discovery Channel.
[02:26:53.871 --> 02:26:55.112]  Then he got threatened and wouldn't come on anymore.
[02:26:55.132 --> 02:26:56.753]  He was well-spoken at ninety-something years old.
[02:26:57.253 --> 02:27:02.496]  And it was all declassified that they were creating hurricanes or killing hurricanes or weather systems.
[02:27:03.177 --> 02:27:06.459]  By 1967, Stanford Research Navy certified
[02:27:07.399 --> 02:27:09.160]  Uh, with the Air Force involved as well.
[02:27:09.740 --> 02:27:12.481]  And so, we've talked to meteorologists about the different stuff they can spray.
[02:27:12.501 --> 02:27:14.762]  They can spray and make it rain, or spray and make it not rain.
[02:27:15.122 --> 02:27:16.523]  And they've done the testing, as you know.
[02:27:16.563 --> 02:27:18.464]  They are killing the rain on the West Coast.
[02:27:18.884 --> 02:27:22.846]  What do you think, at least for California and Oregon, what do you think the plan is there?
[02:27:25.254 --> 02:27:31.020]  I mean, I think it's to turn it into a desert, like you said, and get up these farms for pennies on the dollar.
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:34.204]  That's it, then turn the water back on.
[02:27:34.224 --> 02:27:35.366]  That's right, go ahead, sorry.
[02:27:35.886 --> 02:27:36.507]  Exactly.
[02:27:36.627 --> 02:27:42.514]  I also found an article saying that the top four bottled water companies
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:45.041]  I mean, there's different additives and stuff, but
[02:28:02.472 --> 02:28:03.973]  I mean, you'll still be able to get water to drink.
[02:28:03.993 --> 02:28:11.875]  They're just going to jack up prices and have a big scam and then say it's the new blue gold and put UN regulations on it and claim it's global warming and use the crisis.
[02:28:12.215 --> 02:28:15.136]  They clearly are helping Engineer as another power grab.
[02:28:15.156 --> 02:28:15.837]  Thank you so much.
[02:28:15.877 --> 02:28:16.797]  Great points, Dominic.
[02:28:18.117 --> 02:28:20.438]  Kim Chasers, that's a great documentary series they do.
[02:28:20.818 --> 02:28:22.419]  Sherry in Texas, thanks for holding.
[02:28:23.735 --> 02:28:24.435]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:28:24.956 --> 02:28:31.859]  Listen, regarding the indoctrination of our children, here's a message of hope, at least in my opinion, okay?
[02:28:32.159 --> 02:28:37.842]  That there's a bright, creative, intuitive mind born every day and the suckers are dying out.
[02:28:38.343 --> 02:28:41.805]  So, I think the globalist's greatest threat regarding us
[02:28:42.865 --> 02:29:04.014]  Is our spiritual nature, our ability to function... And the fact that God... I'm going to keep you over and hold, this is so important, because I'm not cutting you off, but yes, there are going to be children, and we know this is happening, just like they spray bugs with poison, a few generations later they have bugs that are semi-immune and then immune by the 7th, 8th, 9th generation.
[02:29:04.294 --> 02:29:09.736]  Well, you're going to be having spiritual children, but also genetically and chemically that are more resistant.
[02:29:10.237 --> 02:29:10.837]  And so, yeah,
[02:29:11.900 --> 02:29:14.681]  No matter what they hit us with, humans are very special.
[02:29:14.721 --> 02:29:22.303]  We're just going to end up, at least a percentage of us, jumping that curve and actually making us stronger.
[02:29:22.683 --> 02:29:23.523]  Is that what you're getting at?
[02:29:24.464 --> 02:29:24.764]  Yes.
[02:29:24.924 --> 02:29:28.665]  It's a mind-body connection that the globalists don't want to admit that we have.
[02:29:29.555 --> 02:29:34.256]  That our right brain is capable of evoking and receiving God's guidance, healing.
[02:29:34.696 --> 02:29:39.697]  We have healers in our community we can't talk about because we don't want them disappearing overnight, you know?
[02:29:39.897 --> 02:29:41.338]  And intercessory prayer heals.
[02:29:41.398 --> 02:29:46.859]  And there was something on 60 Minutes that exemplified how they're trying to confuse us about this.
[02:29:47.079 --> 02:29:50.160]  Well, we're going to come right back and get your take on that.
[02:29:50.760 --> 02:29:52.660]  Undoubtedly, humans have a lot of potential.
[02:29:53.100 --> 02:29:56.221]  The Army found that in secret studies that were declassified that they're trying to suppress.
[02:29:58.065 --> 02:30:01.069]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:04.674]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.338 --> 02:30:10.558]  Another major health threat.
[02:30:10.598 --> 02:30:15.500]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:30:15.580 --> 02:30:18.221]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:30:18.261 --> 02:30:25.023]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:30:25.303 --> 02:30:28.164]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:30:28.304 --> 02:30:31.225]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:30:31.325 --> 02:30:33.225]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:30:33.245 --> 02:30:36.086]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:30:36.186 --> 02:30:41.687]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:30:41.907 --> 02:30:45.388]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:30:45.408 --> 02:30:48.409]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:32:09.332 --> 02:32:12.835]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:32:12.995 --> 02:32:16.958]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:17.278 --> 02:32:18.740]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:19.060 --> 02:32:26.646]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[02:33:23.686 --> 02:33:31.211]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:32.032 --> 02:33:42.979]  We're meant to war game and then train the robots how to be more human than human and that's actually in USA Today today, Sirius founder
[02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:53.626]  He envisions a world of cyberclones, tech-med, and the cyberclones will become more us than us and will actually tell us what to do and basically replace us.
[02:33:55.387 --> 02:33:58.509]  So that's the bizarreness of what the elite believe, whether that's going to happen or not.
[02:34:00.110 --> 02:34:01.871]  And they're waging war against humanity.
[02:34:01.931 --> 02:34:04.373]  I didn't know that Joe Bannister, the former Treasury agent,
[02:34:05.542 --> 02:34:09.483]  I've been a frequent guest on the show and some of my earliest documentaries has called in.
[02:34:09.503 --> 02:34:13.384]  He found out the IRS was all a big fraud and started exposing it.
[02:34:13.404 --> 02:34:14.845]  They tried to put him in jail repeatedly.
[02:34:14.865 --> 02:34:16.905]  He was found not guilty in jury trials.
[02:34:17.425 --> 02:34:21.587]  Another true American hero, he wanted to come in on the Kent Hovind case, a political prisoner.
[02:34:21.607 --> 02:34:26.028]  Now they're openly waging... I was talking to a high-level state judge just a couple months ago.
[02:34:28.021 --> 02:34:30.983]  And he said, no, it really opens my eyes.
[02:34:31.004 --> 02:34:32.184]  The IRS is really doing this.
[02:34:32.245 --> 02:34:34.626]  And it woke up a lot of judiciary that we really are in tyranny.
[02:34:35.287 --> 02:34:36.048]  This is a state judge.
[02:34:36.108 --> 02:34:37.389]  I mean, this is really going on.
[02:34:37.869 --> 02:34:42.793]  And sometimes, evil is so outrageous, you can't believe it's actually happening.
[02:34:43.513 --> 02:34:45.075]  It's industrial scale now.
[02:34:45.135 --> 02:34:48.658]  It's not just a few evil guys trying to screw good people over in the system.
[02:34:48.698 --> 02:34:49.879]  It is a unified effort.
[02:34:50.199 --> 02:34:52.340]  The Republican leadership is quietly backing it.
[02:34:52.621 --> 02:34:55.003]  The Democrats are honchoing it and riding the beast.
[02:34:55.711 --> 02:34:57.013]  We'll go to Jo Bannister in a moment.
[02:34:57.333 --> 02:35:00.117]  Sherry in Texas, you had a point about 60 minutes.
[02:35:00.157 --> 02:35:00.497]  Go ahead.
[02:35:01.398 --> 02:35:04.723]  Yeah, there was an example of how our society is trying to lead us away from
[02:35:05.535 --> 02:35:15.204]  understanding that we are, we're human beings, but primarily we also function from a spiritual level, you know, and connect, we can connect with God.
[02:35:15.924 --> 02:35:17.946]  That's why Intercessory Prayer heals, you know.
[02:35:18.326 --> 02:35:24.832]  So there was this episode, it was some years ago, about these people with this amazing autobiographical memory.
[02:35:25.312 --> 02:35:29.396]  They could recall any day from their way back, three years old, two years old.
[02:35:29.416 --> 02:35:31.438]  Well that's Mary Lou Henner, we've had her on the show.
[02:35:32.395 --> 02:35:32.975]  Okay.
[02:35:33.335 --> 02:35:42.079]  Well, in that show, there was a segment in the show where they confused the viewers.
[02:35:42.820 --> 02:35:45.781]  It was about where in the brain the activity takes place.
[02:35:46.201 --> 02:36:01.068]  And a guy held up the model of a brain, but instead of holding it up on the flat of his hand and then pointing very clearly, here's the front of the brain, here's the back of the brain, here's where the activity takes place in the right temporal lobe, he covered the front of the brain with his left hand.
[02:36:01.608 --> 02:36:15.824]  And then he covered, like holding either end of a football, he covered the back end of the brain with his right hand, and then he said, and here's where the activity takes place, and he rotated his right hand around to point to the right temporal lobe.
[02:36:16.619 --> 02:36:20.101]  And now, mind you, the front and the back of the brain, he shows where they are, then he covers them.
[02:36:20.542 --> 02:36:26.806]  And so when he points to the right temporal lobe, at that same time, the camera starts spinning.
[02:36:27.346 --> 02:36:28.747]  And the whole room is spinning.
[02:36:28.767 --> 02:36:33.890]  This is... I don't... Well, you know, that might have just been an accident on the show, but I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[02:36:33.990 --> 02:36:36.332]  I mean, I don't know what the point of doing that would be.
[02:36:36.352 --> 02:36:42.936]  What I was getting into the brain was that they have all these articles just saying, we're just animals, we don't have free will, it's all in the brain.
[02:36:43.851 --> 02:36:47.277]  But then the elites are trying to always influence and manipulate us and we know there is free will.
[02:36:48.402 --> 02:36:50.084]  Unless you've been basically turned into a zombie.
[02:36:50.564 --> 02:36:51.825]  Now, I want to hurry through calls.
[02:36:51.865 --> 02:36:54.747]  I want to go to Mark, Bob, Daniel, many others that are patiently holding.
[02:36:55.608 --> 02:36:58.651]  Kent Hovind, if he just joined us, has been in jail almost 10 years.
[02:36:59.652 --> 02:37:01.013]  School teacher, no criminal record.
[02:37:01.934 --> 02:37:03.255]  Had reached over a billion people.
[02:37:03.275 --> 02:37:04.696]  30 plus languages.
[02:37:04.736 --> 02:37:12.963]  His books and videos have been translated into saying that the official story of evolution is a fraud.
[02:37:12.983 --> 02:37:14.004]  Well, it's been proven a fraud.
[02:37:14.787 --> 02:37:20.739]  But they try to make it a scientific debate to discredit Christianity so Christians then try to become scientists and then try to discredit that.
[02:37:21.616 --> 02:37:33.525]  I don't buy into Kent Hovind's interpretation of the Bible completely, and I certainly know the globalist, transhumanist, eugenicist, social Darwinist are a bunch of occultists, because I've studied their own writings.
[02:37:33.565 --> 02:37:36.868]  I've actually read what Darwin and his cousin Galton and others wrote.
[02:37:37.429 --> 02:37:41.171]  This was funded by the British royal family as an excuse to say the public were animals.
[02:37:41.232 --> 02:37:46.235]  It went back to Thomas Malthus in saying that 80% of the public should be exterminated.
[02:37:46.255 --> 02:37:47.677]  That's why you always hear that number.
[02:37:48.297 --> 02:37:50.358]  He said the earth hit its carrying capacity by 1900.
[02:37:50.398 --> 02:37:54.399]  Well, you notice it didn't.
[02:37:56.960 --> 02:37:58.280]  So it's a complex issue.
[02:37:58.640 --> 02:37:59.500]  But that doesn't matter.
[02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:00.761]  He has the First Amendment.
[02:38:01.501 --> 02:38:08.103]  And even the New York Times admitted, they had hearings last month, that tens of thousands of people a year are not even indicted.
[02:38:08.123 --> 02:38:09.123]  Their bank accounts are grabbed.
[02:38:09.143 --> 02:38:10.944]  If they complain, they're then indicted.
[02:38:11.710 --> 02:38:13.250]  And they have kangaroo juries.
[02:38:13.571 --> 02:38:14.511]  These are being exposed.
[02:38:14.551 --> 02:38:19.232]  That's why you're getting some juries actually fighting against the IRS now because they're having to seat real juries.
[02:38:20.452 --> 02:38:22.913]  Not, you know, basically pick juries.
[02:38:23.973 --> 02:38:27.134]  And people are being found not guilty.
[02:38:27.454 --> 02:38:37.137]  But in the case of Dr. Kent Hovind, he's still in there and they went after him because if they could take him down, they could take everybody down.
[02:38:38.021 --> 02:38:49.533]  And the law said taking $10,000 out of a deposit before taxes, when you were trying to launder money or hide it, that you could then be indicted for money laundering, if it was in association with a crime.
[02:38:50.114 --> 02:38:54.018]  Well, even the New York Times admitted, well now they do it down to a couple hundred dollars.
[02:38:55.540 --> 02:38:59.484]  And totally innocent people with no criminal records, who were even getting after-tax money.
[02:39:00.643 --> 02:39:26.097]  So, there's a war on cash and a war on the people, but bigger than that, there is a war on Christians, real Christians, to intimidate the church to go under total government control and the faith-based initiative started by Bush, expanded by Obama, where you go to big churches now, I don't care if they're Baptist, Catholic, what it is, it's house the illegals, turn your guns in, world government's good, abortion's not that bad, Bill Gates loves you.
[02:39:28.938 --> 02:39:29.839]  It is amazing.
[02:39:30.959 --> 02:39:33.701]  And people believe the church is God now.
[02:39:34.821 --> 02:39:37.263]  And they will sit there and go against the teachings of Christ.
[02:39:38.604 --> 02:39:41.686]  I don't care if it's Methodist, you name it, and your family goes to these.
[02:39:41.766 --> 02:39:46.268]  I've talked to people, family I have, they go, doesn't matter, I'm going to that church, I love that church.
[02:39:46.969 --> 02:39:50.551]  The church becomes God, well, the state runs the church, the state is now God.
[02:39:50.991 --> 02:39:59.377]  Now I don't know his take on this, but Joe Bannister, we could take an hour, you know, going over all the stuff he went through, another hero of this fight, former Treasury agent,
[02:40:00.217 --> 02:40:01.117]  Heard radio shows.
[02:40:01.578 --> 02:40:04.199]  Heard the IRS was basically a collection agency of the Federal Reserve.
[02:40:04.219 --> 02:40:04.759]  Didn't believe it.
[02:40:05.079 --> 02:40:06.300]  Spent a year researching it.
[02:40:06.860 --> 02:40:08.841]  Went to a supervisor and said, can you disprove this?
[02:40:08.861 --> 02:40:10.102]  And they said, how about you just resign?
[02:40:11.222 --> 02:40:13.783]  And then they tried to put him in prison repeatedly for giving speeches.
[02:40:14.984 --> 02:40:17.105]  But he got good juries and was found not guilty.
[02:40:17.145 --> 02:40:19.066]  But this is not a game.
[02:40:19.106 --> 02:40:21.587]  The real war is here at home in America.
[02:40:22.227 --> 02:40:27.630]  But Kent Hovind, Dr. Kent Hovind, he is still in prison, sleeping on the floor.
[02:40:29.231 --> 02:40:31.512]  And it doesn't matter if other cases have been overturned.
[02:40:31.532 --> 02:40:33.054]  They're having hearings in Congress.
[02:40:33.394 --> 02:40:41.200]  They tried to call him in and convict him on new stuff just last month and he was found not guilty in that trial except on one charge.
[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:44.943]  So they want to keep Kent Hovind in jail.
[02:40:45.203 --> 02:40:46.704]  Why do you think that is, Joe Bannister?
[02:40:49.046 --> 02:40:55.631]  Well, they definitely want to discredit and silence anybody that is a credible resource.
[02:40:56.192 --> 02:41:00.935]  And, you know, you don't have to be an IRS special agent or a former one to be credible.
[02:41:01.335 --> 02:41:03.836]  And Dr. Oven is obviously very credible.
[02:41:05.657 --> 02:41:08.859]  And they've got to silence people like that.
[02:41:09.119 --> 02:41:12.721]  And, you know, they tried to do it to me, and I was fortunate.
[02:41:12.741 --> 02:41:17.784]  I mean, he deserved justice every bit as much as I did and didn't get it.
[02:41:18.124 --> 02:41:21.165]  And, of course, he's making them miserable inside.
[02:41:22.006 --> 02:41:23.567]  I try to make them miserable outside.
[02:41:25.602 --> 02:41:28.945]  I really, Alex, I just appreciate everything that you guys all do.
[02:41:29.186 --> 02:41:39.755]  And I wanted to chime in to support what he asked as far as getting people upset so they'll actually, you know, shout out to these policy makers and lawmakers.
[02:41:39.835 --> 02:41:47.642]  But as you've educated your listeners for a long time, there's always an ulterior motive behind the legislation that's proposed and passed in D.C.
[02:41:50.106 --> 02:41:51.247]  You're so on target.
[02:41:51.327 --> 02:41:56.451]  The money laundering laws and the structuring laws that you talked about, those are a part of the money laundering laws.
[02:41:56.471 --> 02:42:02.195]  This is what you were trained for years and have a degree in and, you know, rated real criminals, you know, that were really laundering money.
[02:42:03.556 --> 02:42:10.081]  Describe the hearings in Congress, the New York Times article, and specifically why these are being misapplied.
[02:42:11.698 --> 02:42:19.764]  Well, these agendas, as you've described so many times, are, you know, 50-year plans, 20-year plans.
[02:42:19.824 --> 02:42:23.827]  They have all this stuff, you know, ginned up before they implement it.
[02:42:24.628 --> 02:42:36.577]  And with the money laundering, they wanted to spy on all of America, really all of the world, on their cash transactions, on any financial transactions.
[02:42:36.597 --> 02:42:39.399]  You've talked about FinCEN, the Orwellian
[02:42:40.331 --> 02:42:43.672]  Uh, group that monitors financial transactions throughout the world.
[02:42:44.293 --> 02:42:50.895]  And so they used as a veneer or a smoke screen that we have to go after these drug dealers and these drug smugglers.
[02:42:51.656 --> 02:42:55.557]  And everybody, you know, most, most Americans are like, yeah, well, let's go after them.
[02:42:56.257 --> 02:42:58.418]  And so they picked the bad guy to go after.
[02:42:58.598 --> 02:43:08.202]  And then they usher in this entire framework of a spy grid for all financial transactions and especially cash transactions.
[02:43:08.855 --> 02:43:22.839]  And that way, they not only can trip up people, like Mr. Hovind, who they want to silence, but they can monitor everyone's transactions, just as the NSA does with their spying.
[02:43:22.859 --> 02:43:30.921]  So the ulterior motive, obviously, as is the case over and over again, is to spy on the American people.
[02:43:31.001 --> 02:43:33.982]  But they use some other excuse to do that.
[02:43:35.618 --> 02:43:45.988]  I just want to encourage people to absolutely scream bloody murder to the policymakers and legislators, because this is a... It's just a Trojan horse.
[02:43:46.048 --> 02:43:54.475]  They're spying on us financially, trying to get rid of cash and monitor cash transactions while we still have it, and it's just a...
[02:43:55.669 --> 02:43:58.410]  It's a total screw job as you've said over and over again.
[02:44:14.818 --> 02:44:26.364]  And if I try to go to the bank and get $3,000 or $4,000 out, if I'm going overseas in case my credit cards get turned off, when I go cover Bilderberg or something, I've got a crew of like six or seven people, $3,000 or $4,000 isn't even enough.
[02:44:26.404 --> 02:44:33.588]  So last time we left the country, we got like $8,000 or something in case they turned our cards off, because we've had that done before as a form of harassment.
[02:44:33.948 --> 02:44:38.971]  And the bank was just like freaking out, going, this is under $10,000, but don't think you're not going to get looked at.
[02:44:39.031 --> 02:44:40.752]  I'm like, look, Dad, it's after-tax money.
[02:44:41.292 --> 02:44:42.252]  Or it's company money.
[02:44:42.292 --> 02:44:43.172]  I mean, I don't care.
[02:44:43.632 --> 02:44:49.514]  You know, I send my reporters out with like $2,000 cash when they take a team of three or four people to California or New York.
[02:44:49.914 --> 02:44:52.314]  That's not enough to even get back if their cards get turned off.
[02:44:53.875 --> 02:45:00.196]  It's just crazy how they make all of us criminals and that it's not even really laws.
[02:45:00.276 --> 02:45:02.896]  It's just regulations passed by Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:45:04.657 --> 02:45:04.857]  Right.
[02:45:05.097 --> 02:45:10.818]  Well, again, I didn't want to take any more time, but I just want to let people know it's an absolute Trojan horse.
[02:45:11.621 --> 02:45:17.909]  And I really hope that you'll help Dr. Hoeven out with, you know, screaming at your legislators, the policy makers.
[02:45:18.530 --> 02:45:25.995]  That they create this framework, and then they go after good people, and it's got to stop, and we all have to, you know, scream bloody murder about it.
[02:45:26.435 --> 02:45:28.577]  Well, they, of course, went after you once.
[02:45:28.597 --> 02:45:30.037]  You got a trial, found not guilty.
[02:45:30.057 --> 02:45:31.458]  You might recap that for folks.
[02:45:31.799 --> 02:45:33.180]  And then I think a second time, correct?
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:34.781]  You didn't shut up, you intensified.
[02:45:35.041 --> 02:45:35.681]  Think about him.
[02:45:36.121 --> 02:45:37.402]  I know, because it's come out on record.
[02:45:37.422 --> 02:45:41.165]  They've told him, recant, go along, and we'll let you out.
[02:45:41.225 --> 02:45:43.506]  They said, just give us your ministry, we won't put you in jail.
[02:45:43.546 --> 02:45:44.167]  He said, no.
[02:45:44.587 --> 02:45:45.628]  Ten years in jail,
[02:45:46.408 --> 02:45:54.497]  Just to hear how honorable and wholesome he was, and to feel it in my gut, or a Christian would say in my spirit, made tears in my eyes.
[02:45:55.438 --> 02:45:59.502]  For the people that would put him in jail, I was about to say,
[02:46:01.224 --> 02:46:04.766]  On air, man, I wouldn't want to get between, you know, God and them.
[02:46:04.846 --> 02:46:10.288]  God's going to come after them, because I see people have judgment brought on them, not when they die, but on this world.
[02:46:10.608 --> 02:46:14.370]  And then the guest, after Hovind had left, brought up the article.
[02:46:14.430 --> 02:46:15.090]  We put it on screen.
[02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:17.231]  I'd forgotten his prosecutor
[02:46:18.453 --> 02:46:22.296]  was a horrid pedophile who committed suicide.
[02:46:22.836 --> 02:46:28.199]  So, I mean, just a year later or less, look at how judgment got brought on that guy.
[02:46:28.219 --> 02:46:30.781]  I mean, that's what's so scary about this.
[02:46:30.821 --> 02:46:36.365]  The God-fearing part of me shudders when I see the things these evildoers engage in.
[02:46:36.385 --> 02:46:44.810]  I would encourage people, the way I've achieved the most peace is to pray for my enemies.
[02:46:44.890 --> 02:46:47.132]  Pray for those who want to do me harm.
[02:46:47.964 --> 02:46:51.209]  Let God take care of the rest, and your peace will come.
[02:46:51.710 --> 02:46:57.559]  I'm talking about even people that are mad because they go after Ken Hogan or Joe Bannister or Alex Jones.
[02:46:57.980 --> 02:46:59.062]  You've still got to pray for them.
[02:46:59.082 --> 02:47:02.848]  That's what Jesus said to do, and it's best to follow what Jesus told us to do.
[02:47:05.011 --> 02:47:05.771]  How have you done it?
[02:47:05.811 --> 02:47:13.615]  Because it would take three hours to tell the story, but they put you through living hell, and you've told me privately it made you a much stronger man, and that it's actually been rewarding.
[02:47:13.715 --> 02:47:18.317]  But describe what that process of going across the stormy seas has been like for you.
[02:47:18.717 --> 02:47:26.180]  Former special agent, rising up quickly, great record, and then you found out about the Matrix and Agent Smith came after you.
[02:47:27.621 --> 02:47:30.182]  Well, the Matrix is a pretty good metaphor because
[02:47:30.825 --> 02:47:45.469]  I really intended to spend a full 20-year career with the IRS, lots of family and friends that are in law enforcement, and really just wanted to do good by my country, use my financial skills to help my country and defend the Treasury and all these noble things.
[02:47:46.210 --> 02:47:56.653]  And a few years into the career, found that some allegations, you know, that the IRS, things you talk about a lot, how the IRS is really just a scam, it's a, you know,
[02:47:57.785 --> 02:48:01.546]  What brother of the Federal Reserve has to work with... The Treasury was seized.
[02:48:01.586 --> 02:48:02.906]  There was a financial coup.
[02:48:04.987 --> 02:48:09.428]  Yeah, to cheat and steal from the people without them knowing.
[02:48:10.369 --> 02:48:17.971]  And so it took me two years to kind of wade through it all to see, wow, I think there's enough truth here that I should speak up.
[02:48:18.651 --> 02:48:19.311]  I spoke up.
[02:48:19.951 --> 02:48:21.192]  They told me to hit the road.
[02:48:21.612 --> 02:48:22.452]  They didn't fire me.
[02:48:22.492 --> 02:48:25.813]  They just said, you better hit the road because we're not going to answer any of your questions.
[02:48:26.255 --> 02:48:29.356]  And that was in 1999, back in the last century.
[02:48:30.037 --> 02:48:40.921]  And I was attacked in 2004, indicted, acquitted in 2005, thankfully, as is deserved by Mr. Hovind and so many other people.
[02:48:41.641 --> 02:48:51.845]  And I don't really... When you say about crying, Alex, it really hurts me, too, because I don't... You know, we have to accept what our lot in life and God's will.
[02:48:52.785 --> 02:49:00.469]  And I got justice, and I deserved it, and there's so many people that deserve justice, at least in our eyes, and don't get it.
[02:49:00.589 --> 02:49:11.075]  So I just try my best here on the outside to make a stink, and there's lots of people like Mr. Hovind on the inside that are making a stink, and we all just have to help each other.
[02:49:11.095 --> 02:49:17.419]  And again, pray for our enemies while we're doing that, because we need to follow what God tells us to do.
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:20.602]  And then God will, I think, help us all tomorrow.
[02:49:21.062 --> 02:49:22.363]  Well, exactly.
[02:49:23.223 --> 02:49:31.989]  The fact that all this is coming out about the structuring laws and the harassment of Christians, and now the whole Christian community is starting to find out about Kent Hovind saying, I remember him, he's in jail.
[02:49:33.690 --> 02:49:38.253]  I think in God's plan, he'll end up reaching even more people because of this persecution.
[02:49:38.833 --> 02:49:46.338]  And, you know, he sounded stronger, as he was on with me a few times before they put him in jail, he sounded stronger now than he sounded 10 years ago.
[02:49:48.541 --> 02:49:53.203]  When we look at all the...certainly in the Gospels, in St.
[02:49:53.223 --> 02:50:03.946]  Paul's writings, all those writers were persecuted, crucified, tortured, and that's the words that we live by today.
[02:50:04.026 --> 02:50:10.268]  So, we all have to do our best to be good examples and follow them as best we can, as imperfect as we are.
[02:50:10.288 --> 02:50:14.250]  But each one of us can do an awful lot, you know, every listener out there.
[02:50:16.204 --> 02:50:17.625]  And you're doing a great job at all.
[02:50:17.645 --> 02:50:19.325]  No, brother, you're doing a great job.
[02:50:19.345 --> 02:50:20.286]  We're all in this together.
[02:50:20.886 --> 02:50:22.147]  And this is a great test.
[02:50:22.447 --> 02:50:24.848]  There is a war going on, and that's what's so frustrating.
[02:50:25.248 --> 02:50:36.272]  The system doesn't want you to ever know the Federal Reserve is private, or ever know the NSA is spying, but all those veils are dropping, so humanity can have a big choice whether we're going to go into total slavery or say no.
[02:50:36.353 --> 02:50:39.974]  God always gives us a choice, and we're being given a choice right now.
[02:50:40.054 --> 02:50:41.795]  Will we get the reprieve as Nineveh got?
[02:50:42.927 --> 02:50:45.790]  Undoubtedly this beast system is going to come in, but do we get a reprieve?
[02:50:45.871 --> 02:50:46.391]  More time?
[02:50:46.792 --> 02:50:48.053]  Or does it start to happen now?
[02:50:48.113 --> 02:50:49.234]  We're at that crossroads.
[02:50:49.595 --> 02:50:52.398]  The churches won't tell you that we set that course.
[02:50:53.379 --> 02:50:54.020]  It's our will.
[02:50:54.440 --> 02:50:55.602]  Thank you so much, Joe Banister.
[02:50:55.622 --> 02:50:58.105]  We're going to come back and talk to Daniel, Mark, and others.

[02:53:07.774 --> 02:53:10.956]  Every business owner knows how tough it is to get financing for their business.
[02:53:11.216 --> 02:53:16.239]  Whether the cash is needed for expansion, repairs, or growth, when you need financing, you need a reliable source.
[02:53:16.460 --> 02:53:20.102]  Banks are happy to hold your deposits, but don't bother to ask them for a business loan.

[02:54:21.838 --> 02:54:33.466]  Joe Biggs and Joe Jennings, two of the InfoWars crew, are out riding their choppers, their cruisers, in downtown Austin handing out free InfoWars bumper stickers.
[02:54:33.506 --> 02:54:35.168]  I didn't tell them to do that, but they're out there doing that.
[02:54:35.788 --> 02:54:36.489]  So there you go.
[02:54:36.509 --> 02:54:37.730]  If you see them, flag them down.
[02:54:39.036 --> 02:54:43.977]  We're going to have South by Southwest coverage all throughout the week and next week as we hijack their operations.
[02:54:44.017 --> 02:54:47.157]  I'm going to do some overdrive here to finish up with all of these callers.
[02:54:47.617 --> 02:54:50.298]  I mentioned some of this news but didn't really get into it in detail.
[02:54:51.098 --> 02:54:51.838]  London Guardian.
[02:54:52.078 --> 02:55:00.700]  Rising energy prices will change and will challenge Western Way of Life Ministry of Defense report as they jack up energy prices worldwide.
[02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:01.600]  That's the plan.
[02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:03.360]  Then they act like it's accidentally happening.
[02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:05.261]  APCEO.
[02:55:05.741 --> 02:55:07.561]  Government undermining right to know laws.
[02:55:09.125 --> 02:55:13.527]  FDA proposes to let drug companies undermine official safety warnings.
[02:55:13.567 --> 02:55:22.872]  That way we can't actually show you the inserts saying vaccines can kill you or give you diabetes or give you narcolepsy or give you epilepsy or hundreds of other things.
[02:55:23.492 --> 02:55:23.873]  Literally.
[02:55:25.293 --> 02:55:28.495]  I mean, they are really trying to shut stuff down.
[02:55:28.935 --> 02:55:35.098]  South by Southwest banned Gene Giant Kicks OCA Off South by Southwest Food Panel Discussion.
[02:55:35.619 --> 02:55:38.260]  So even Whole Foods and People now won't have organic discussions.
[02:55:38.320 --> 02:55:39.161]  It's just all a joke.
[02:55:41.322 --> 02:55:44.003]  And they're trying to pass a law in Texas banning filming the police.
[02:55:44.143 --> 02:55:45.624]  I mean, it is just getting crazy.
[02:55:45.644 --> 02:55:46.545]  And then this article.
[02:55:47.895 --> 02:55:50.917]  Pedophilia in Britain, woven into the fabric of society.
[02:55:51.178 --> 02:55:56.381]  Theresa May, the UK has launched a new judge-led inquiry panel to investigate a pedophile ring operated in the 1980s.
[02:55:56.902 --> 02:55:59.204]  The Home Secretary warns the allegation is just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:55:59.464 --> 02:56:04.207]  The problem is woven covertly, ooh, a conspiracy, into the fabric of our society.
[02:56:04.227 --> 02:56:05.248]  Yeah, it's a pedophile cult.
[02:56:06.569 --> 02:56:08.451]  And a lot of Homeland Security at the top.
[02:56:09.671 --> 02:56:11.212]  Is pedophiles, folks.
[02:56:11.272 --> 02:56:11.752]  It's a fact.
[02:56:11.912 --> 02:56:13.853]  Just like the Vatican, this is the group.
[02:56:13.893 --> 02:56:16.555]  It's not the Vatican, it's not the cops, it's not the British government.
[02:56:16.835 --> 02:56:18.916]  It's a pedophile guild of devil worshippers.
[02:56:19.617 --> 02:56:21.017]  I don't know how else to explain it to people.
[02:56:21.057 --> 02:56:24.079]  It's just... This is now RT UK.
[02:56:24.119 --> 02:56:26.620]  I mean, this is mainstream news quoting her.
[02:56:27.361 --> 02:56:28.181]  The head of the inquiry.
[02:56:28.962 --> 02:56:31.903]  A secret conspiracy of pedophiles woven into the government.
[02:56:31.923 --> 02:56:36.646]  And then you find out they're not... Pedophilia is only one level.
[02:56:36.686 --> 02:56:38.167]  There's Satanism above that.
[02:56:39.738 --> 02:56:40.819]  God help us.
[02:56:40.839 --> 02:56:50.046]  And then they have all these movies and TV shows about Satanism doesn't exist, and they're always persecuting local police departments that try to report on it.
[02:56:50.066 --> 02:56:53.589]  They make them put in the files that it was just crazy people and not Satanism.
[02:56:53.869 --> 02:56:58.412]  There's a huge conspiracy to cover up Satanism and Luciferianism, two different things.
[02:56:59.713 --> 02:57:03.896]  Low level it's Satanism, even in the elite, but the top it's Luciferianism.
[02:57:04.217 --> 02:57:05.698]  Briefly, and then I'm going to go to your phone calls,
[02:57:07.076 --> 02:57:10.699]  We're offering the biggest special sales we ever have.
[02:57:11.379 --> 02:57:15.182]  And yes, sales spur sales, and so I like sales, but they really are better deals.

[02:57:50.641 --> 02:57:52.321]  Then I decided, no, everything.
[02:57:53.061 --> 02:57:54.402]  And it's been changed in the computer code.
[02:57:54.422 --> 02:57:55.442]  We probably need to change that manner.
[02:57:56.282 --> 02:57:57.743]  10% off everything.
[02:57:58.423 --> 02:57:59.924]  And that's not a fault of my graphics people.
[02:57:59.944 --> 02:58:01.304]  It's a fault of me going, you know what?
[02:58:01.584 --> 02:58:02.284]  Everything, everything.
[02:58:02.584 --> 02:58:04.085]  But it's two days only.
[02:58:05.196 --> 02:58:08.059]  We're going to end this at 2 o'clock Wednesday, because I launched it today.
[02:58:08.079 --> 02:58:09.760]  I'm going to run a little bit more than two days.
[02:58:09.780 --> 02:58:12.563]  I'm going to end it at 2 o'clock Wednesday.
[02:58:13.243 --> 02:58:14.664]  It is Monday the 16th.
[02:58:15.966 --> 02:58:26.015]  On the 18th, we will terminate this special on everything, whether it's Survival Seed Vault, Moan Labe clothing, books, films, everything.
[02:58:26.035 --> 02:58:28.437]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:29.654 --> 02:58:37.658]  And more importantly than buying products from us, even though they're super high quality and life-changing, when you talk about InfoWarsLive.com, pray for us.
[02:58:38.558 --> 02:58:39.459]  Defend the Republic.
[02:58:39.839 --> 02:58:40.840]  Pray that I be strong.
[02:58:40.920 --> 02:58:41.840]  I'm under a lot of attack.
[02:58:41.880 --> 02:58:45.082]  It makes me stronger, quite frankly, and I just don't know why I'm so blessed.
[02:58:45.322 --> 02:58:47.303]  I just love God, and I appreciate all of you.
[02:58:47.583 --> 02:58:48.623]  Spread the word about the show.
[02:58:48.883 --> 02:58:50.844]  The enemy hates it, whether it's AM, FM, Internet.
[02:58:51.105 --> 02:58:51.805]  Tell people.
[02:58:51.845 --> 02:58:53.686]  The enemy wants to shut us down for a reason.
[02:58:54.166 --> 02:58:57.188]  We are in the dragon's face, stabbing viciously.
[02:58:57.468 --> 02:58:57.848]  Stay with us.
[02:58:59.463 --> 02:59:00.263]  Alex Jones here.
[02:59:00.463 --> 02:59:09.427]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:59:09.627 --> 02:59:14.909]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[02:59:15.189 --> 02:59:24.633]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend, crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body
[02:59:24.993 --> 02:59:28.234]  For what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.
[02:59:28.455 --> 02:59:39.639]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity.

[03:00:11.781 --> 03:00:17.803]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:18.423 --> 03:00:21.464]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:31.208 --> 03:00:33.448]  Final segment, jamming some final calls in.
[03:00:33.508 --> 03:00:35.049]  Daniel in Tennessee, thanks for holding.
[03:00:35.089 --> 03:00:36.269]  Then Mark in Oregon and others.
[03:00:36.309 --> 03:00:36.689]  Go ahead.
[03:00:38.490 --> 03:00:38.890]  Hey, Dan.
[03:00:39.190 --> 03:00:39.931]  Uh, hey, Alex.
[03:00:39.951 --> 03:00:40.591]  It's Daniel.
[03:00:41.011 --> 03:00:41.331]  Hey, brother.
[03:00:42.458 --> 03:00:47.369]  Yeah, I've tried your products, like, for quite some time now and they really do work for those out there listening.
[03:00:48.071 --> 03:00:50.056]  I've talked to you before about, like, um...
[03:00:51.051 --> 03:00:53.233]  Uh, aboriginal or American Indian people.
[03:00:53.634 --> 03:01:01.801]  And what you were saying earlier, I'm glad I caught you while you were kind of in a state of mind, but I kind of have a testimony to give about, like, even going to churches.
[03:01:01.821 --> 03:01:07.987]  Like you said, it doesn't matter what church we go to, people don't want us to believe that we can have a relationship with our Creator.
[03:01:08.467 --> 03:01:13.552]  You know, I read the King James 1611 Bible daily, but, um,
[03:01:14.116 --> 03:01:17.345]  I think Aboriginal and American Indian people hold a key.
[03:01:18.006 --> 03:01:18.829]  Even our ancestors.
[03:01:18.869 --> 03:01:19.952]  We all come from a tribe.
[03:01:19.972 --> 03:01:22.278]  You know, the 12 tribes of Israel all come from the Klamath.
[03:01:23.141 --> 03:01:30.847]  In our, you know, genetic past, like I've talked to you before about awakening our DNA and how there's memories inside of our, you know, our DNA code and stuff.
[03:01:31.067 --> 03:01:40.054]  Well, that's right, and expanding on that, people act like it's only Africans or Native Americans that used to run around with feathers in their heads and beating on drums.
[03:01:40.615 --> 03:01:43.737]  Everybody's just two steps out of the jungle or two steps out of the hills.
[03:01:44.077 --> 03:01:50.082]  We're all primitives, and that's our culture, and we need to... People act like Europeans landed in spaceships or something.
[03:01:50.962 --> 03:01:52.183]  I mean, it's just not the case.
[03:01:52.223 --> 03:01:54.925]  We're all savages at heart, which is a good thing.
[03:01:56.886 --> 03:02:00.628]  Right, and added to that, I mean, we can all have a relationship with our Creator.
[03:02:00.668 --> 03:02:04.891]  We don't, you know, God doesn't necessarily live in any church or any building, you know.
[03:02:05.131 --> 03:02:06.172]  We're creating His image.
[03:02:06.352 --> 03:02:06.672]  That's right.
[03:02:06.692 --> 03:02:14.297]  These churches want to make you go through their priesthoods first to try to find God, and then they obscure God, and it's sickening.
[03:02:14.357 --> 03:02:15.038]  Thank you for the call.
[03:02:15.798 --> 03:02:18.180]  You can always tell with discernment, though, who's real and who isn't.
[03:02:18.260 --> 03:02:19.501]  Mark in Oregon, you're on the air.
[03:02:21.089 --> 03:02:22.009]  Good day to you, Alex.
[03:02:22.870 --> 03:02:27.391]  Alex, I called last week basically about what I call my template for a solution.
[03:02:28.331 --> 03:02:30.672]  I'd like to break it down just a little more today.
[03:02:30.692 --> 03:02:42.135]  The Declaration of Independence actually instructs us and authorizes us to throw off a tyrannical federal government, even a state government.
[03:02:42.933 --> 03:02:46.074]  If it does not abide by the Constitution of the United States.
[03:02:46.094 --> 03:02:46.374]  That's right.
[03:02:46.394 --> 03:02:53.415]  When SWAT teams raid houses now, federally, they will put it in the file and call for more jail time if you have a Declaration of Independence.
[03:02:53.895 --> 03:02:56.876]  The founding document is seen as a criminal terrorist manifesto.
[03:02:57.856 --> 03:02:58.396]  Absolutely.
[03:02:58.436 --> 03:03:07.678]  Now, Alex, my idea is simply this, and it's based on the fact that we have a 7% approximate approval rating of the U.S.
[03:03:07.798 --> 03:03:08.859]  House of Representatives.
[03:03:08.879 --> 03:03:09.919]  Depending on the polls, 7 to 10, yeah.
[03:03:11.547 --> 03:03:11.927]  I don't know.
[03:03:32.302 --> 03:03:35.083]  All of these members of the Washington, D.C.
[03:03:35.163 --> 03:03:44.706]  power base and the Congress and the Senate as well as it would apply to state legislatures and Senates because there's been a lot of unconstitutional action there also.
[03:03:45.386 --> 03:03:58.731]  Now to put this into concrete terms, Alex, I would recommend that we have days of seminar where such great broadcasters, and there are a good number of them as yourself, who for years have been exposing this evil that we have here in our government,
[03:03:59.389 --> 03:04:08.751]  As well as to have recall petitions handed out at these gatherings, open air, all across the country, out of doors, gaining publicity.
[03:04:08.771 --> 03:04:09.772]  Sounds like a good idea.
[03:04:09.832 --> 03:04:10.912]  Got to jump real quick.
[03:04:10.952 --> 03:04:12.512]  Stephen in Florida, go ahead.
[03:04:14.313 --> 03:04:15.333]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[03:04:15.493 --> 03:04:24.736]  Hey, I forwarded an email to you from this group called FreePress.com and so I hope you'll look at that and I sent the show to you.
[03:04:24.756 --> 03:04:26.216]  Okay, we only have about 45 seconds, go ahead.
[03:04:27.205 --> 03:04:34.052]  It was basically a great victory with what the FCC passed last week, and I told them, I responded, I said, go to your site.
[03:04:34.472 --> 03:04:40.699]  But I want to say this, the time for the polite pandering and
[03:04:41.392 --> 03:04:45.676]  Uh, you know, passive response on the part of Christians to what's going on is way passive.
[03:04:45.696 --> 03:04:56.625]  If you read Patrick Henry's speech, that was the catalyst to get our Founding Fathers into the Revolutionary War, because he said it's time for war, the time for negotiation is over with.
[03:04:56.665 --> 03:04:59.868]  And I'm so tired of this response by Christians.
[03:04:59.888 --> 03:05:07.214]  Well, I agree we should at least up the rhetoric and the info war and get really aggressive, or it's going to come to total takeover and we're going to have to fight.
[03:05:10.060 --> 03:05:15.693]  The Genesis Communications Network is one of America's premier broadcasters of captivating talk radio.
