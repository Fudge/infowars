[00:00:00.631 --> 00:00:03.240]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:15.768 --> 00:00:16.409]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:18.090]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:19.951]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.612 --> 00:00:21.412]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:23.094]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:27.397]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.938 --> 00:00:31.981]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.827 --> 00:00:40.611]  Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, the mayor of Baltimore, Maryland, couldn't be more transparent.
[00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:47.094]  Back when the rioting started, the looting, and a few days ago, they didn't call it rioting or looting, they called it protesting.
[00:00:47.134 --> 00:00:51.376]  So did CNN, MSNBC, and the usual suspects like Al Sharpton.
[00:00:53.918 --> 00:01:02.322]  Now she's come out and declared a state of emergency, but before she did that, she said, well, we decided to give people an area to vent their anger and to basically loot.
[00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:05.865]  Now the National Guard have been called out.
[00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:08.647]  What were we just saying a month ago about Jade Helm?
[00:01:09.328 --> 00:01:14.913]  The White House tried to trigger race riots and the targeting of police racially last summer.
[00:01:16.234 --> 00:01:23.220]  They have sent operatives from the Justice Department in with the Trayvon Martin situation, with the Brown situation in Ferguson.
[00:01:24.221 --> 00:01:26.964]  It's gone over the top this time.
[00:01:28.263 --> 00:01:36.825]  Clearly they want to make the issue about race an infighting while the globalists steal our basic liberties on every front.
[00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:38.506]  This is the big political distraction.
[00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:46.248]  Obama couldn't deliver jobs, he couldn't deliver anything to the black community, but double unemployment in the last seven years of his reign.
[00:01:47.588 --> 00:01:55.530]  But the social engineers believe they can boost that 13% voting block that votes about 90% Democratic Party
[00:01:58.547 --> 00:02:01.448]  By invoking massive racial division.
[00:02:02.648 --> 00:02:05.548]  I know that you as an audience understand this and it's very transparent.
[00:02:06.788 --> 00:02:12.329]  But for the general public, they still don't quite get what's happening here.
[00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:24.192]  We also have the police being ordered to stand down, but being ordered to target even mainstream journalists like CBS News Cruise and the Associated Press on video.
[00:02:24.572 --> 00:02:26.172]  Brutally beating
[00:02:27.276 --> 00:02:28.016]  Innocent people.
[00:02:28.076 --> 00:02:30.678]  So this is an engineered operation.
[00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:38.042]  The police shamefully have followed illegal orders to not stop rioters and looters and people engaged in racial attacks.
[00:02:38.862 --> 00:02:43.925]  And now they're following their evil orders to attack journalists.
[00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:47.447]  And quite frankly, we saw this in Ferguson.
[00:02:48.527 --> 00:02:52.009]  Where Joe Biggs was shot with rubber bullets, doing nothing.
[00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.410]  Purposefully, Jakari Jackson was attacked.
[00:02:56.891 --> 00:03:00.212]  BBC, Al Jazeera, Vice was attacked.
[00:03:00.612 --> 00:03:04.114]  Didn't matter if you were a black reporter, a white reporter, an Arab reporter, a British reporter.
[00:03:04.494 --> 00:03:06.595]  You were being chased down and hunted and beaten.
[00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:08.196]  And shot.
[00:03:09.293 --> 00:03:11.735]  And I don't want to be enemies with the police.
[00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:13.936]  You're being played like idiots.
[00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:18.380]  And the looters and rioters, of course, are the biggest idiots of them all.
[00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:21.942]  Some of the police said, we know what's going on.
[00:03:21.982 --> 00:03:22.783]  We appreciate you.
[00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:25.505]  Others would say, get out of there with that camera.
[00:03:25.525 --> 00:03:26.605]  I'll crack your head open.
[00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:28.026]  Just total idiots.
[00:03:28.747 --> 00:03:33.070]  But they're getting cops from the pool that is the American people.
[00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.991]  And let's just say it.
[00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.233]  America's still a great country, has the greatest accomplishments in history, but we've fallen a long way.
[00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:49.738]  And the police reflect the pile of steaming, decadent, thug life, thug culture crud that America's become.
[00:03:49.778 --> 00:03:54.361]  And by the way, we got black thugs, we got Hispanic thugs, we got Asian thugs, we got white thugs.
[00:03:54.781 --> 00:04:02.886]  They've now got a talking point on MSNBC and CNN, we've got the clips coming up, that if you call these looters and rioters thugs, it's code word for racism.
[00:04:03.976 --> 00:04:08.537]  No, it's code word for a bunch of trash and hood rats.
[00:04:09.378 --> 00:04:11.318]  We got white hood rats around here.
[00:04:11.338 --> 00:04:13.879]  They're called drag rats that go around robbing people.
[00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.280]  And I don't like black thugs and I don't like white thugs.
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.841]  It's real simple.
[00:04:19.941 --> 00:04:21.822]  And I'm sick of the political correctness.
[00:04:21.882 --> 00:04:22.922]  It's not going to work.
[00:04:24.716 --> 00:04:39.346]  Sitting there saying we're racist if we don't like thugs attacking people because of their race and burning buildings and attacking people's cars and beating up Russian reporters because they're white.
[00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:41.147]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[00:04:41.167 --> 00:04:43.929]  The Russians haven't done jack squat to black people.
[00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:46.030]  And Baltimore is a black run city.
[00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.231]  In fact, there's the headline.
[00:04:47.251 --> 00:04:49.132]  It's not just CNN, MSNBC saying it.
[00:04:49.633 --> 00:04:54.436]  The drummer on The Tonight Show is popping off on TV about it's code word for the n-word.
[00:04:56.558 --> 00:04:57.579]  I'm just so sick of it.
[00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.183]  I mean, the public is just so dumbed down for the most mindless issues.
[00:05:01.863 --> 00:05:03.225]  We're gonna cover it all.
[00:05:03.385 --> 00:05:05.287]  Matt Drudge says this could bring down America.
[00:05:05.907 --> 00:05:07.689]  If we let it, it could, and that's the plan.
[00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:08.130]  Stay with us.
[00:05:09.796 --> 00:05:16.302]  As the city of Baltimore struggles to deal with violence and looting, I'm reminded of something the mayor recently said.
[00:05:16.803 --> 00:05:30.235]  It's a very delicate balancing act, because while we tried to make sure they were protected from the cars and other things that were going on, we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well, Mayor Rawlings-Blake said in part.
[00:05:30.836 --> 00:05:32.638]  In other words, a stand-down order.
[00:05:33.078 --> 00:05:41.402]  And I'm very much against using things like tear gas on peaceful demonstrators, but to allow people to destroy part of the city is something else entirely.
[00:05:42.283 --> 00:05:47.265]  The answer to these situations is not to federalize the police as the Justice Department suggests.
[00:05:47.826 --> 00:05:53.449]  Because remember, the MRAPs and other armaments these departments get, they get from the Pentagon.
[00:05:54.369 --> 00:06:00.552]  Which is to say, if federalized police take over, you're not going to see less of these armaments, you're going to see more.
[00:06:01.432 --> 00:06:04.714]  Check out the Alex Jones channel on YouTube for more reports.

[00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:21.923]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:07:22.263 --> 00:07:24.845]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:07:24.965 --> 00:07:28.326]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:07:28.527 --> 00:07:31.268]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system.
[00:07:31.408 --> 00:07:34.530]  And are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:39.694]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:07:39.994 --> 00:07:46.159]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:07:46.359 --> 00:07:53.825]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[00:07:54.085 --> 00:08:01.394]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[00:08:01.655 --> 00:08:05.119]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:08:23.781 --> 00:08:29.763]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:30.484 --> 00:08:32.184]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:36.106 --> 00:08:41.448]  Well, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings two days ago had this to say...
[00:08:43.033 --> 00:08:48.674]  Um, we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well.
[00:08:49.394 --> 00:08:58.476]  And we work very hard to, uh, to keep that balance and, and to put ourselves in the best position to deescalate.
[00:08:58.576 --> 00:08:59.457]  And that's what you saw.
[00:09:02.197 --> 00:09:10.539]  Anyone who has any basic understanding of sociology, anthropology, mob psychology, I don't care what color the thugs are knows.
[00:09:13.536 --> 00:09:36.180]  and understands that if you let a bunch of criminal elements, most of them that turns out not even from in Maryland but out of DC, come in like it's a looting party to burn stuff, beat people up, and rob electronics and jewelry shops, you're going to create an area of lawlessness to allow that to expand.
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.941]  Notice this stuff always happens in disarmed areas with incredible gun restrictions.
[00:09:43.308 --> 00:09:52.373]  Somebody comes looting down my street, I don't care if you've got red hair, or you're black, or you're Arab, or you're Chinese, I'm gonna put a bullet in your chest.
[00:09:56.756 --> 00:09:59.398]  I don't want to kill you, but you're not going to burn my house down and loot it.
[00:10:00.178 --> 00:10:01.159]  You're not going to attack me.
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.981]  So I'm going to put a bunch of double locked buck into you.
[00:10:05.802 --> 00:10:08.403]  And I'm not going to aim for your legs, so you can sue me later.
[00:10:10.925 --> 00:10:12.986]  So, if you're going to come with guns, you better know how to use them.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.283]  I can shoot a clay pigeon at 120 yards.
[00:10:21.026 --> 00:10:25.251]  Not shooting my mouth off, but I come from a culture of people that aren't laying down.
[00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:30.939]  We're not out robbing, we're not out looting, we're building civilization, and you want to try to take it down?
[00:10:31.099 --> 00:10:31.901]  You gotta go through me.
[00:10:33.217 --> 00:10:36.878]  This is 100% George Soros, Barack Obama engineered.
[00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:39.279]  This is the plan to bring down America.
[00:10:40.019 --> 00:10:45.301]  And I've said there's massive preparations for martial law and tyranny I've never seen in 20 years of broadcast.
[00:10:45.942 --> 00:10:47.502]  This appears to not be a drill.
[00:10:48.062 --> 00:10:52.084]  This appears everything we see converging towards a convergence point
[00:10:52.984 --> 00:10:58.345]  An event horizon that could be martial law this summer as every major city burns.
[00:10:59.026 --> 00:11:04.167]  And I have mainline analysts, media pundits, you name it, saying the same thing.
[00:11:05.587 --> 00:11:18.570]  And notice Jade Helm is lined up right along these times so Obama can come out with some declaration to ban large sectors of types of guns.
[00:11:19.991 --> 00:11:20.811]  Large classes.
[00:11:21.854 --> 00:11:24.360]  And people are saying, well that's crazy, it'll cause a civil war.
[00:11:25.242 --> 00:11:25.963]  That's the plan.
[00:11:27.046 --> 00:11:28.309]  You're like, well that'll wreck the country.
[00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:29.171]  That's the plan.
[00:11:29.532 --> 00:11:31.636]  That's Cloward and Piven on steroids.
[00:11:33.666 --> 00:11:35.927]  The globalists are bold, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:36.808 --> 00:11:56.759]  And if they're willing to start a war with Russia and Ukraine, if they're willing to turn ISIS loose, Al Qaeda renamed, all over the Middle East and overthrow our allies, like Egypt, and call them heroes on CNN, while they're burning every church in the country and crucifying Christians upside down, they're willing to pull some hardcore operations.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.841]  Now, the Egyptians were able to defeat it.
[00:12:00.965 --> 00:12:03.426]  20 million people came out in the streets of Cairo and other cities.
[00:12:03.866 --> 00:12:06.027]  They've now arrested and convicted the people involved.
[00:12:06.247 --> 00:12:07.488]  They've now released the documents.
[00:12:07.808 --> 00:12:18.272]  This was our number one ally in the Middle East after Israel, showing that Obama's family, cousin, and others out of Kenya were running the operations.
[00:12:19.473 --> 00:12:22.334]  So, it's bold, it's serious, it's hardcore.
[00:12:25.146 --> 00:12:30.392]  And at the end of the day, it's going to hurt black and white and Hispanic and Asian Americans across the board.
[00:12:31.273 --> 00:12:32.454]  It is divide and conquer.
[00:12:33.535 --> 00:12:34.956]  Let me just give you some of the headlines.
[00:12:35.437 --> 00:12:40.843]  National Guard called in to keep the peace in Baltimore after they let the fire spread.
[00:12:41.997 --> 00:12:43.198]  Literally and figuratively.
[00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:57.828]  Huge fires set across Baltimore as Freddie Gray rioters torch city, looters, stores, and injure 15 police officers as violence rages into the night and local politicians are left turning on each other.
[00:12:59.258 --> 00:13:03.562]  I want to play her one more time, two days ago, saying we gave folks a space to riot.
[00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:08.726]  In every city in America, there are people ready to riot, loot, and set things on fire.
[00:13:08.846 --> 00:13:11.829]  Excellent article at Infowars.com by Michael Schneider.
[00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.333]  The city of Baltimore has transformed into an absolute war zone, close quote.
[00:13:17.543 --> 00:13:19.324]  Matt Drudge on Baltimore riots.
[00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:20.804]  America could fall.
[00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:21.864]  K.I.
[00:13:22.104 --> 00:13:26.846]  continues as authorities are accused of failing to deal with unrest.
[00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:31.047]  Paul Watson has a detailed report at Infowars.com, dovetailed with that.
[00:13:31.587 --> 00:13:33.068]  We should probably add to the Drudge story.
[00:13:34.168 --> 00:13:37.409]  Mayor ordered police to stand down during Baltimore riots.
[00:13:37.449 --> 00:13:39.290]  I mean, it's the same story over and over again.
[00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:40.370]  Just like the L.A.
[00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:45.592]  riots with the police chief, who was later declassified with CIA, Darrell Gates.
[00:13:48.123 --> 00:13:49.685]  Now, are the cops themselves bad?
[00:13:50.065 --> 00:13:55.430]  No, but they were ordered to stand down, and I'm telling you, that's why I would never be a cop, or I'd get kicked off.
[00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:59.053]  I mean, they told me, don't respond to people looting and burning buildings.
[00:13:59.113 --> 00:14:03.417]  I mean, that's criminal as a citizen if it's happening in front of you not to do something.
[00:14:03.678 --> 00:14:04.659]  It's failure to render aid.
[00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:12.086]  It's like the leaked Border Patrol document two months ago that was on CBS News where they said, don't respond to crime.
[00:14:13.223 --> 00:14:18.727]  Drunk driving, arson, if you pull somebody over with drugs or whatever, just let them go.
[00:14:18.747 --> 00:14:20.908]  It's not our job, if they're any legal.
[00:14:21.609 --> 00:14:32.516]  But let me tell you, from Arizona to Texas, they go in these state parks, national parks, and you've got the feds, they're writing tickets for college students drinking beer.
[00:14:32.916 --> 00:14:38.960]  They'll come up to your campsite and go, no alcohol out in the park, and write tickets for a six-pack of Courage Light.
[00:14:39.601 --> 00:14:42.923]  I've seen it with my eyeballs last year and this year in Big Bend.
[00:14:44.244 --> 00:14:53.588]  Then one time I'm sitting there in a natural hot spring and this white, but then I saw a black guy act like a total thug in his uniform.
[00:14:53.749 --> 00:14:55.749]  My point is, black, white act like thugs.
[00:14:55.769 --> 00:14:56.650]  Some of these bad cops.
[00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.091]  There was an armed National Park Ranger.
[00:15:00.112 --> 00:15:00.792]  He goes, what are you doing?
[00:15:02.076 --> 00:15:04.719]  And I turned around and I was just sitting there in the hot spring and I go, what do you mean?
[00:15:04.739 --> 00:15:05.619]  He goes, what are you doing?
[00:15:05.639 --> 00:15:06.921]  And smiled with his hand on his gun.
[00:15:07.381 --> 00:15:08.242]  Some mental patient.
[00:15:08.302 --> 00:15:10.164]  And I went, whatever, man.
[00:15:10.184 --> 00:15:12.146]  And the guy felt stupid and walked off.
[00:15:12.166 --> 00:15:17.371]  Like, I guess the average person would defecate on themselves or something when somebody puts a hand on their gut and says, what are you doing?
[00:15:18.832 --> 00:15:19.473]  I'm just sitting there.
[00:15:21.775 --> 00:15:33.227]  So yeah, the government wants to hire a bunch of mentally ill thugs, while at the same time authorizing thugs to attack at the ground level, and then have a clash of civilizations dialectic problem reaction solution.
[00:15:33.508 --> 00:15:37.012]  That's the admitted formulae of the Ford Foundation!
[00:15:38.106 --> 00:15:39.407]  And Liberation Theology.
[00:15:39.727 --> 00:15:43.309]  And you've heard us talking about this for years, saying this was coming.
[00:15:43.649 --> 00:15:46.951]  This is one of their major operational plans.
[00:15:47.411 --> 00:15:48.392]  Now let's play the mayor.
[00:15:48.992 --> 00:15:49.753]  The black mayor.
[00:15:50.053 --> 00:15:51.854]  Almost the entire city council is black.
[00:15:52.394 --> 00:15:53.675]  Everyone on the podium is black.
[00:15:54.055 --> 00:15:55.196]  Half the cops are black.
[00:15:56.316 --> 00:15:57.937]  Or more in Baltimore.
[00:15:59.238 --> 00:16:00.939]  And they're making it about
[00:16:02.011 --> 00:16:04.872]  White people, and there's calls by different black groups.
[00:16:05.193 --> 00:16:06.313]  I've got it in my stack here.
[00:16:06.913 --> 00:16:11.716]  The, uh, Guerrilla Family, uh, that's their own weird racist name for themselves, not mine.
[00:16:12.516 --> 00:16:14.737]  Uh, I get emails when I mention them, sayin' they're gonna kill cops.
[00:16:15.338 --> 00:16:18.479]  And then it'll make the cops go into a total paranoia spiral.
[00:16:19.299 --> 00:16:23.942]  It'll then cause them to stop responding even more to crime in predominantly black areas.
[00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:29.111]  And it's just a recipe for total civil war.
[00:16:29.632 --> 00:16:33.974]  And that's how the British brought down China was staging civil wars inside.
[00:16:33.994 --> 00:16:35.395]  It took them 50 years to set it up.
[00:16:35.435 --> 00:16:36.216]  They got it going.
[00:16:37.216 --> 00:16:38.217]  So I've studied history.
[00:16:38.237 --> 00:16:39.037]  We're seeing it again.
[00:16:39.378 --> 00:16:40.218]  Here is the mayor.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.602]  We also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well.
[00:16:48.303 --> 00:16:50.164]  And we worked very hard.
[00:16:50.914 --> 00:16:57.278]  To keep that balance, and to put ourselves in the best position to de-escalate.
[00:16:57.518 --> 00:16:58.399]  And that's what you saw.
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.041]  The Justice Department runs Baltimore.
[00:17:02.141 --> 00:17:03.502]  It's basically a suburb of D.C.
[00:17:03.542 --> 00:17:06.004]  The Justice Department runs the response.
[00:17:06.044 --> 00:17:08.966]  They ran the funeral yesterday, or the memorial service.
[00:17:10.827 --> 00:17:19.473]  Crips and Bloods team up to protest Baltimore cops and say that they're going to start killing them, and quote, taking out officers.
[00:17:23.956 --> 00:17:30.137]  Meanwhile, on The Tonight Show, they've got people spouting off saying it's racist to call these people thugs.
[00:17:31.477 --> 00:17:33.738]  I'll call them dumbed-down, mindless scum.
[00:17:34.378 --> 00:17:37.318]  Just like I'll call the Klan out lynching people the same thing.
[00:17:37.498 --> 00:17:40.999]  It's the exact same mindset of people that have nothing, have done nothing.
[00:17:41.339 --> 00:17:42.499]  All they are is race-based.
[00:17:42.959 --> 00:17:44.640]  They're making excuses for their own failures.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.740]  Thugs equals n-word.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.841]  That's what was said on The Tonight Show.
[00:17:50.901 --> 00:17:51.761]  It's being tweeted out.
[00:17:52.751 --> 00:17:57.905]  When we come back after the break, I'm going to give you the definition of thug, where it actually comes from.
[00:17:59.068 --> 00:18:01.074]  But first, let's play the mayor one more time.
[00:18:05.507 --> 00:18:10.149]  We also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well.
[00:18:10.869 --> 00:18:20.493]  And we worked very hard to keep that balance and to put ourselves in the best position to de-escalate.
[00:18:20.614 --> 00:18:21.134]  Oh really?
[00:18:21.274 --> 00:18:23.855]  We're trying to de-escalate the civil war you want to start.
[00:18:23.995 --> 00:18:25.536]  We're trying to stop a race war.
[00:18:25.836 --> 00:18:27.257]  We're trying to get real justice.
[00:18:27.517 --> 00:18:28.937]  We're trying to reform the police.
[00:18:29.277 --> 00:18:32.319]  It's federal training that's given them the attack dog mentality.
[00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:41.933]  Now let's go to a clip of her now talking about a civil emergency and then the governor.
[00:18:42.214 --> 00:18:46.758]  So a day and a half after they let it all happen, could have shut it down instantly.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.584]  A day and a half after that happened, now this.
[00:18:55.089 --> 00:19:06.926]  I've been in contact with our governor and he has agreed and I have requested and he has agreed to deploy the National Guard as soon as they are available.
[00:19:07.827 --> 00:19:09.570]  They will be immediately deployed.
[00:19:10.427 --> 00:19:17.074]  We've ordered a curfew be in effect, instituting tomorrow the curfew citywide.
[00:19:17.094 --> 00:19:20.358]  Wait a minute, I thought you were going to de-escalate by letting folks loot.
[00:19:20.678 --> 00:19:24.803]  Again, there will be a citywide curfew, 10 p.m.
[00:19:25.143 --> 00:19:26.124]  to 5 a.m.
[00:19:26.525 --> 00:19:29.108]  This preliminary curfew will last for one week.
[00:19:29.848 --> 00:19:32.911]  Yeah, this is how Americans are gonna be trained to be slaves.
[00:19:32.931 --> 00:19:33.952]  Oh, that's enough.
[00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:35.193]  Just shut it down.
[00:19:35.313 --> 00:19:36.934]  You know what juveniles should be doing?
[00:19:36.954 --> 00:19:39.036]  Like my dad, working when they're 12 years old.
[00:19:47.651 --> 00:20:08.354]  Being given responsibilities, learning to be responsible, but no, instead the youth just pick up a gang culture, a thug culture, it's sold by MTV, and then everybody's supposed to bow down to it and worship it, and then no one can even stop people out attacking and looting and burning, because the Justice Department wants this to get out of hand.
[00:20:09.935 --> 00:20:12.516]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:20:12.636 --> 00:20:16.638]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.

[00:21:46.115 --> 00:21:52.060]  And I'm thinking, yeah, 1992 presidential campaign, oh my god, a gun grabber in the White House.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.043]  So at Guns80.com, they've come up with a Hillary Clinton special.

[00:22:08.632 --> 00:22:09.573]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:09.733 --> 00:22:13.557]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds.
[00:22:13.998 --> 00:22:15.699]  I lift weights five days a week.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.421]  I can swim two, three miles.
[00:22:17.762 --> 00:22:20.705]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[00:22:20.925 --> 00:22:22.507]  I started an access television show.
[00:22:22.887 --> 00:22:27.692]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[00:22:28.273 --> 00:22:31.136]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[00:22:31.636 --> 00:22:37.363]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[00:22:37.724 --> 00:22:42.570]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[00:22:42.991 --> 00:22:47.877]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[00:22:48.137 --> 00:22:55.223]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Group for InfoWarsLife.com, the results were incredible.

[00:23:54.484 --> 00:23:54.784]  Call today.
[00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:31.815]  As a result of the serious violence and looting which has led to the destruction of property and put innocent Marylanders at significant risk, I have declared a state of emergency at the request of Baltimore City.
[00:24:32.975 --> 00:24:36.736]  This order deploys the Maryland National Guard
[00:24:38.641 --> 00:24:46.621]  in order to help restore order and to end the unrest that we witnessed today and tonight.
[00:24:47.731 --> 00:24:49.372]  I've not made this decision lightly.
[00:24:50.173 --> 00:24:53.756]  The National Guard represents a last resort in order to restore order.
[00:24:53.876 --> 00:24:55.557]  And that's Governor Larry Hogan.
[00:24:56.478 --> 00:25:09.649]  The establishment thinks we're so stupid that we don't realize that the Justice Department, the Ford Foundation, the universities, MTV, all these rappers and other people
[00:25:11.598 --> 00:25:17.404]  Just want to feel like victims and just get up there all day hyping up tragic police shootings.
[00:25:18.325 --> 00:25:19.987]  A lot of times the police get indicted.
[00:25:20.988 --> 00:25:23.991]  A lot of times the police lose their jobs.
[00:25:25.692 --> 00:25:31.739]  The cops that shot that white homeless guy for no reason have now been indicted in Albuquerque.
[00:25:33.437 --> 00:25:35.938]  Folks are getting indicted that are shooting black people in the back.
[00:25:36.439 --> 00:25:57.607]  But we can show you footage of black cops shooting unarmed black people, or black cops shooting white people, and most of the time it's not racially based, it's that the cops have been given instinctive firing training, and don't know what they're doing in some cases, and are so scared to death that they've got a hair trigger.
[00:25:59.212 --> 00:26:03.140]  But still, if you look at the statistics, police shootings are flat in this country.
[00:26:04.163 --> 00:26:06.728]  They're statistically what they were in the 90s.
[00:26:07.189 --> 00:26:09.213]  If you go back to the 70s and 60s, it was higher.
[00:26:11.824 --> 00:26:14.907]  A lot of that was probably leaded gasoline and things we know make people more aggressive.
[00:26:14.987 --> 00:26:16.048]  There's major studies on that.
[00:26:16.068 --> 00:26:21.652]  That's why the Romans were so aggressive, they now know, as they were lining their pots with lead.
[00:26:21.993 --> 00:26:27.277]  There's a lot of chemical reasons for things that go on, but the studies are there as well.
[00:26:27.457 --> 00:26:37.406]  Most cops, even in black cities, just don't want to go into the thug, low-income areas because they don't want to get shot at or they don't want to get sued or they don't want to get blamed.
[00:26:37.786 --> 00:26:39.788]  They don't feel like there's community support.
[00:26:41.195 --> 00:26:43.018]  And so they don't respond.
[00:26:43.538 --> 00:26:50.608]  That's why blacks are twice as less likely, and again we showed the studies a few weeks ago on air, to be shot than a white or Hispanic.
[00:26:52.791 --> 00:26:58.638]  Because whites predominantly, but Hispanics a little bit less in statistics, will call the cops.
[00:27:01.246 --> 00:27:02.527]  And sometimes it goes bad.
[00:27:03.348 --> 00:27:06.310]  You know, you call the cops because your husband just punched you and they end up killing him.
[00:27:06.931 --> 00:27:08.312]  Or you got a schizophrenic brother.
[00:27:08.452 --> 00:27:09.633]  I read about this all the time.
[00:27:09.753 --> 00:27:11.635]  I have family that this happened to.
[00:27:12.095 --> 00:27:13.716]  Distant family, but in Houston.
[00:27:15.138 --> 00:27:18.140]  It was my great aunt's second husband, so I'm not related, but it was his daughter.
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:22.704]  Was schizophrenic and was freaking out and they called the cops and they came and killed her.
[00:27:24.454 --> 00:27:29.740]  She was not even armed, but she wouldn't come out and then the SWAT team went in and did they kill her because she was white?
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:34.445]  No, they killed her because you got 10 guys coming in your house with a bunch of guns, people end up pulling the trigger.
[00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:42.894]  Grand jury just cleared a cop who shot a mentally ill man for holding a screwdriver.
[00:27:44.827 --> 00:27:47.688]  The point is, we don't need a civil war out of this.
[00:27:48.148 --> 00:28:03.415]  The point is, why is the White House and George Soros spending hundreds of millions of dollars over the last few years, 30 plus million just to stir up Ferguson garbage, because it's all they've got is getting us to fight with each other.
[00:28:03.475 --> 00:28:04.475]  And I know you get it.
[00:28:06.756 --> 00:28:13.839]  But how do we get this information that we're covering out to the general public?
[00:28:15.916 --> 00:28:16.636]  How do we do that?
[00:28:17.957 --> 00:28:21.239]  That's the big question that we need to get across to everyone.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.101]  How do we expose it?
[00:28:24.121 --> 00:28:25.261]  Well, we have the perfect opportunity.
[00:28:25.862 --> 00:28:32.585]  You go to InfoWars.com, you get the videos and the breakdowns of the people caught red-handed.
[00:28:35.807 --> 00:28:36.307]  Red-handed.
[00:28:38.629 --> 00:28:38.989]  The mayor.
[00:28:41.354 --> 00:28:47.318]  Letting people loot and riot to get the ball rolling, and the Justice Department stirring up Trayvon Martin secretly.
[00:28:47.758 --> 00:29:04.949]  It turns out they're getting the riots going that didn't really catch fire, and getting it going in Ferguson, and then ordering the attack on media in Ferguson and in Baltimore and other areas because the media is the enemy, especially if it's alternative media, because we'll actually show the stand down.
[00:29:05.711 --> 00:29:08.432]  We're going to go to break and come back and get to video.
[00:29:08.792 --> 00:29:13.794]  Brave Vietnam Vet stands up to rioting children in Baltimore and also the video.
[00:29:14.054 --> 00:29:14.974]  There's no audio.
[00:29:16.274 --> 00:29:25.457]  But it's on ABC News of a mother going out finding her son, teenage son, who's looting and she starts beating him with a purse.
[00:29:26.338 --> 00:29:33.300]  I wonder if the CPS is going to come take... I wonder if the CPS is going to come and take
[00:29:34.352 --> 00:29:36.894]  His kid away, her kid away because she dared stop him.
[00:29:37.115 --> 00:29:38.936]  Yeah, I guess the cops are just supposed to kill him.
[00:29:39.337 --> 00:29:40.017]  Or put him in prison.
[00:29:40.718 --> 00:29:51.408]  You see, probably comes from a fatherless home, and there's mama trying to get him in line, and he had the nerve, looks like he's about 15, to slap her back when she was slapping him.
[00:29:52.629 --> 00:29:54.831]  And all she's trying to do is keep him from going to prison.
[00:29:55.892 --> 00:29:57.533]  That little thug needs to get his ass beat.
[00:29:59.105 --> 00:30:02.115]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.038 --> 00:30:05.726]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.778 --> 00:30:17.246]  Did you know that the World Health Organization recently classified radio frequency EMFs as class 2B carcinogens?
[00:30:17.466 --> 00:30:17.927]  That's right.
[00:30:18.087 --> 00:30:30.120]  Frequencies from radios, TVs, microwave ovens, cell phones, and Wi-Fi devices are now in the same category as exposure to lead, chloroform, gasoline, and the pesticide DDT.
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:45.639]  A recent scientific report titled, Why Children Absorb More Microwave Radiation Than Adults, argued that children and fetuses absorb more microwave radiation because their bodies are relatively smaller, their skulls are thinner, and their brain tissue is more absorbent.
[00:30:45.839 --> 00:30:53.421]  Another study published by the British Medical Journal determined that exposure to cell phone towers alters brain function in alarming ways.
[00:30:53.581 --> 00:30:56.962]  Lack of concentration, irritability, difficulty sleeping.
[00:30:57.202 --> 00:30:58.762]  Ah, but don't worry, there's a pill for that!
[00:30:59.102 --> 00:31:02.563]  To learn more, subscribe to the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:31:02.803 --> 00:31:09.185]  We are currently the test subjects in one big human experiment, which we won't know the results of for several decades.
[00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:10.751]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:10.911 --> 00:31:18.599]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lift weights five days a week, I could swim two, three miles.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.863]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[00:31:22.123 --> 00:31:23.685]  I started an access television show.
[00:31:24.085 --> 00:31:28.870]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:32.314]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[00:31:32.834 --> 00:31:38.560]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a Jabba the Hutt.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:43.745]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[00:31:44.165 --> 00:31:49.070]  I started taking Super Mel Vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:50.772]  When I added to the mix,
[00:31:51.112 --> 00:31:55.015]  The key products developed by Dr. Group for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:31:55.315 --> 00:31:56.395]  The results were incredible.

[00:32:18.463 --> 00:32:26.672]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:26.852 --> 00:32:31.556]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:31.736 --> 00:32:38.462]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:32:38.522 --> 00:32:45.608]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:32:45.728 --> 00:32:52.574]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:32:52.714 --> 00:32:57.078]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:32:57.198 --> 00:33:00.461]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:33:00.601 --> 00:33:06.727]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:33:06.887 --> 00:33:08.589]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:11.206 --> 00:33:16.527]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:33:16.547 --> 00:33:20.728]  Homeland security begins with hometown security.
[00:33:25.729 --> 00:33:35.670]  It seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets, which may make scoring particularly difficult, even with this year's rule changes.
[00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:39.151]  To recap those revisions, women
[00:33:40.445 --> 00:33:44.068]  ...are still worth 10 points more than men in all age brackets.
[00:33:44.768 --> 00:33:53.315]  But teenagers now rack up 40 points, and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70 points.
[00:33:53.535 --> 00:34:02.342]  The big score, anyone, any sex, over 75 years old, has been upped to 100 points.
[00:34:03.482 --> 00:34:09.387]  As always, how fast you move determines how long you live.
[00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:17.061]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:34:17.682 --> 00:34:19.383]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:25.567 --> 00:34:33.872]  Coming up, we've got Jakari Jackson's report talking to citizens, protesting by the hundreds, Jade Helm outside Austin, Texas.
[00:34:34.353 --> 00:34:39.176]  It was all over local television and in the local paper and also made national news yesterday.
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:44.983]  As citizens expose the attempt to basically end posse commentatus.
[00:34:46.244 --> 00:34:53.289]  But before I get into that and other world news and Max Keiser's joining us, I wanted to show some video of your a TV viewer.
[00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:56.972]  I'll describe it for radio listeners of what happened yesterday when a mother.
[00:34:58.191 --> 00:35:03.312]  Watching live coverage, saw her son out involved in the looting.
[00:35:03.332 --> 00:35:04.633]  Looks like he's about 14, 15.
[00:35:05.453 --> 00:35:11.075]  She comes over and starts basically punching him and slapping him in the head to make him stop looting.
[00:35:11.895 --> 00:35:17.256]  He punches her back and this is really the sadness of single moms.
[00:35:17.296 --> 00:35:19.517]  I bet a million dollars she is a single mom.
[00:35:21.001 --> 00:35:23.823]  Looks like she's maybe 30 years old.
[00:35:24.363 --> 00:35:26.584]  Probably had this guy when she was 15.
[00:35:27.104 --> 00:35:31.987]  And there she is trying to keep him from getting killed or keeping him from getting put in prison.
[00:35:33.248 --> 00:35:35.889]  And he is basically slapping back at his mother.
[00:35:36.249 --> 00:35:40.292]  Where were the men to go over and help a woman trying to get her son in line?
[00:35:43.894 --> 00:35:46.815]  Well, they were standing right there letting it happen.
[00:35:48.336 --> 00:35:49.797]  Truly disgusting.
[00:35:52.094 --> 00:35:54.155]  But this is child abuse in America.
[00:35:54.175 --> 00:35:56.615]  I guess it's better he be tasered or shot or put in prison.
[00:35:56.635 --> 00:36:00.016]  What is she supposed to do but physically drag him out of there?
[00:36:05.058 --> 00:36:09.859]  But these youth are never taught the dangers of the way they're behaving.
[00:36:11.246 --> 00:36:12.247]  It's the same thing with the government.
[00:36:12.267 --> 00:36:17.190]  The government's been caught over and over again doing every crime you can imagine, but it's gotten away with it.
[00:36:17.531 --> 00:36:22.214]  So now the central government, far and run, believes it can get away with anything.
[00:36:23.455 --> 00:36:33.822]  But now the central government has read the tea leaves and knows the people are waking up, so they want to have a nice little civil war, which will have us begging for military on the streets and curfews permanently.
[00:36:34.102 --> 00:36:38.966]  This could be the new false flag 9-11, as I've been saying for six years of Obama.
[00:36:39.994 --> 00:37:03.616]  That they are preparing a race war 9-11 crisis and out of that crisis the next phase with Republicans coming into office will be law and order where conservatives and libertarians and whites who feel threatened will accept a police state in the name of restoring order but then the police state will be flipped on yet again everyone.
[00:37:05.049 --> 00:37:14.312]  This is the problem, reaction, solution, Hegelian dialectic from the philosopher Hegel, adopted by the Chicago Business School and the neocons.
[00:37:14.832 --> 00:37:17.353]  And bipartisanly, this is the plan.
[00:37:20.854 --> 00:37:24.456]  You throw a brick through your window and blame your political opposition.
[00:37:24.876 --> 00:37:28.477]  You firebomb your own capital and blame your opposition.
[00:37:30.506 --> 00:37:31.627]  The Nazis did all of this.
[00:37:32.307 --> 00:37:35.368]  But every other corrupt political party does it as well.
[00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:40.010]  So many leftist Jewish groups have been caught attacking their own synagogues.
[00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:43.492]  So many leftist black groups have been caught attacking their own churches.
[00:37:43.972 --> 00:37:48.594]  So many leftist white groups have been caught claiming they were raped.
[00:37:49.034 --> 00:37:52.356]  And it's done to garner sympathy because they know that
[00:37:53.342 --> 00:37:59.627]  Christians, conservatives, libertarians of every race, color, and creed are moral people that care.
[00:38:00.187 --> 00:38:06.232]  And so we can be beaten into submission to feel guilty to then accept their agenda.
[00:38:08.554 --> 00:38:09.915]  Their whole thing is about guilt.
[00:38:10.936 --> 00:38:17.101]  Be guilty you're a homophobe, let us teach your three-year-old how to suck a golf ball through a garden hose.
[00:38:19.923 --> 00:38:20.524]  That's what they teach.
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:26.242]  We want your three-year-old to sign a pledge to have gay friends.
[00:38:26.722 --> 00:38:28.123]  Like a three-year-old even knows what that is.
[00:38:28.483 --> 00:38:44.091]  It's meant to make their whole mindset not about 2 plus 2 equals 4, not about mystery, not about the stars, not about nutrition, not about family, not about different cultures, but sign a pledge to learn how to suck golf balls through garden hoses.
[00:38:46.192 --> 00:38:46.692]  Essentially.
[00:38:48.333 --> 00:38:50.574]  I mean, this is a scientific takeover.
[00:38:53.305 --> 00:38:55.227]  I made a film about it, Endgame 2.0.
[00:38:58.389 --> 00:39:00.591]  I called it 1.5 because I was planning another installment.
[00:39:01.412 --> 00:39:05.895]  And we could show the university documents with a professor from the 60s for the whole plan for this.
[00:39:06.216 --> 00:39:13.422]  It's not like I know what's going to happen next because I've got some big palantir, some giant purple crystal ball in my living room.
[00:39:15.744 --> 00:39:22.129]  I know what's going on because the globalists think we're all incredibly stupid.
[00:39:23.911 --> 00:39:25.854]  And are just executing their takeover.
[00:39:28.697 --> 00:39:33.303]  And that's why they can have the mayor come out and say, we let folks loot, let them get their anger out.
[00:39:33.403 --> 00:39:37.649]  No, that actually gets it going, because it sends the message, hey, you can get away with this.
[00:39:39.013 --> 00:39:52.401]  Just like they did in 1999 with predominantly, I'd say 90%, white, well-meaning liberals who were against non-GMO labeling and against losing our rights to WTO and international treaties.
[00:39:52.601 --> 00:39:53.541]  Good liberals.
[00:39:54.162 --> 00:39:55.843]  Educated, real people.
[00:39:56.883 --> 00:39:59.225]  The type that are against GMOs, against vaccines.
[00:39:59.265 --> 00:40:00.105]  They know what's going on.
[00:40:00.325 --> 00:40:01.746]  They know the Democratic Party's corrupt.
[00:40:02.266 --> 00:40:03.867]  They show up by about 100,000 or so.
[00:40:06.325 --> 00:40:07.966]  The airplanes land from Portland.
[00:40:08.447 --> 00:40:12.590]  They disgorge 50 anarchists trained by the Ford Foundation publicly.
[00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:13.310]  I made a film about it.
[00:40:14.151 --> 00:40:15.092]  Please stay to the takeover.
[00:40:15.936 --> 00:40:18.237]  And the cops are ordered to stand down to be hit in the head with bottles.
[00:40:18.497 --> 00:40:19.878]  It's shown on the news for a day.
[00:40:19.898 --> 00:40:22.219]  The next day, people say, do something.
[00:40:22.499 --> 00:40:28.702]  And they turn the cops loose on the 100,000 Peaceful and beat men, women, and children and tear gas children.
[00:40:29.143 --> 00:40:31.364]  And just it was it was disgusting.
[00:40:31.684 --> 00:40:32.304]  And who ran it?
[00:40:32.464 --> 00:40:33.425]  The Delta Force.
[00:40:33.985 --> 00:40:37.667]  And when I had Esquire here last year doing a profile on me, they didn't believe it.
[00:40:39.758 --> 00:40:46.504]  And the Esquire writer went and pulled four different news articles, interviewed the people involved, and said, oh my god, it was a false flag.
[00:40:46.544 --> 00:40:47.965]  And I said, yeah, I told you.
[00:40:47.985 --> 00:40:50.568]  It was even in the newspaper.
[00:40:51.752 --> 00:40:54.093]  We have interviews with the police captains.
[00:40:54.573 --> 00:40:58.315]  I even interviewed later, it's not in the film, the police chief.
[00:40:58.475 --> 00:41:02.417]  I've had the police chief on twice, who was the police chief then.
[00:41:02.998 --> 00:41:04.078]  And he's apologized.
[00:41:04.498 --> 00:41:06.399]  He didn't even understand what was going on.
[00:41:06.719 --> 00:41:13.383]  Because again, Bill Clinton was there, world leaders were there, the feds came in and took the whole operation over.
[00:41:15.475 --> 00:41:18.956]  By the way, Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs are on an airplane right now.
[00:41:19.436 --> 00:41:21.537]  And I said, guys, you just were in Bastrop.
[00:41:21.657 --> 00:41:24.738]  You just got shot in Ferguson with rubber bullets and tear gas.
[00:41:25.038 --> 00:41:26.218]  You really want to go to this?
[00:41:27.259 --> 00:41:28.199]  They said, yeah, we want to go.
[00:41:29.399 --> 00:41:33.580]  And by the way, anybody who isn't black by these racist mobs are being attacked.
[00:41:35.221 --> 00:41:37.522]  So I'm really worried about Joe Biggs, but he wants to do it.
[00:41:37.802 --> 00:41:41.303]  You notice CNN, MSNBC only have black reporters out there.
[00:41:42.062 --> 00:41:44.083]  But no one's mentioning, hey, why aren't there white reporters?
[00:41:44.123 --> 00:41:45.263]  This is a racist mob.
[00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:48.405]  That's what, I mean, can you imagine the Klan?
[00:41:49.725 --> 00:41:52.266]  You know, if whites were out burning things, they'd be stopped.
[00:41:53.987 --> 00:41:57.549]  And imagine if there was only white reporters that could be out, and people say, look how racist it is.
[00:41:57.789 --> 00:41:59.190]  They attack any black reporters.
[00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:09.054]  I mean, it's just hiding, in plain view, how racism by black people has been sold as a cultural right, as something you're supposed to do under political correctness.
[00:42:10.353 --> 00:42:13.394]  With the modern hip-hop music racially based, the rest of it.
[00:42:14.294 --> 00:42:15.234]  Anything goes.
[00:42:17.015 --> 00:42:22.476]  But there's a video of a brave Vietnam vet standing up to rioting children, his words, in Baltimore.
[00:42:22.496 --> 00:42:23.176]  I love my country.
[00:42:23.236 --> 00:42:25.176]  I love my charmed city.
[00:42:25.377 --> 00:42:26.317]  I'm not black.
[00:42:27.317 --> 00:42:31.098]  I'm white, red, yellow, or nothing.
[00:42:32.356 --> 00:42:35.457]  And we've got Robert Valentine out there standing up.
[00:42:35.477 --> 00:42:43.839]  There's also photos, he's interviewed by local paper, of a white gentleman guarding his shop with a machete, and he says he kept about 50 looters at bay.
[00:42:44.619 --> 00:42:45.479]  Where are the guns?
[00:42:45.519 --> 00:42:47.519]  Well, you pull a gun out there, the cops will take you out.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:58.102]  Again, this all is in these inner-city Petri dishes that are models for how they want everybody else to live under the UN-UNESCO Global Treaty Agenda 21.
[00:43:02.972 --> 00:43:04.033]  It's the only thing I have.
[00:43:04.113 --> 00:43:06.294]  I can't pull out a shotgun, he told the Washington Post.
[00:43:06.794 --> 00:43:08.555]  I was able to clear about 50 people away.
[00:43:09.075 --> 00:43:14.017]  I came with my mask on my face, ready to do what I had to do to protect my livelihood.
[00:43:14.597 --> 00:43:19.319]  We've got the photo of the gentleman, who looks pretty scary out there, with his machete.
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:23.982]  And as society degenerates, he wanted to protect his convenience store.
[00:43:25.362 --> 00:43:28.644]  As society degenerates, you're going to see more and more law of the jungle.
[00:43:29.727 --> 00:43:35.309]  That's why they want our guns, so the government can create the crisis and then bring in the tyranny as the solution.
[00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:39.810]  They can't let normal equilibrium take place where people will protect themselves.
[00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:44.332]  The problem is, as we had Professor Lott on yesterday, the demographics changing.
[00:43:44.372 --> 00:43:44.732]  Blacks
[00:43:45.732 --> 00:43:47.694]  Have been one of the lowest groups to own guns.
[00:43:48.174 --> 00:43:53.178]  One reason was it was prohibited to them by racist laws passed in the South, the first gun control laws by the Klan.
[00:43:53.679 --> 00:43:55.220]  That's just, they're not able to stop that.
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.583]  That's why they're called the New Ku Klux Klan because they were founded to fight the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:43:58.803 --> 00:44:00.825]  That's the inverted MSNBC fraud machine.
[00:44:01.245 --> 00:44:03.187]  You were founded to fight the Klan, so you're now the Klan.
[00:44:06.903 --> 00:44:08.624]  You're founded by the Klan to kill people.
[00:44:08.684 --> 00:44:10.744]  You're given awards by the NAACP.
[00:44:11.044 --> 00:44:11.604]  Planned Parenthood.
[00:44:12.345 --> 00:44:12.825]  It's inverted.
[00:44:13.385 --> 00:44:14.525]  You worship Hitler.
[00:44:14.545 --> 00:44:16.186]  You tell Rolling Stone you want to be Hitler.
[00:44:16.386 --> 00:44:17.666]  Your dad is an SS officer.
[00:44:17.686 --> 00:44:19.387]  You're the product of an SS race marriage.
[00:44:19.727 --> 00:44:20.827]  You're given ADL awards.
[00:44:21.067 --> 00:44:21.788]  Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:44:21.988 --> 00:44:23.148]  You fight racism.
[00:44:23.168 --> 00:44:24.568]  You're called a racist by the ADL.
[00:44:25.949 --> 00:44:26.709]  It's how it works.
[00:44:27.069 --> 00:44:28.390]  It's reality inverted.
[00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:30.870]  Literally.
[00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:32.451]  People say I use that word too much, but it is.
[00:44:34.812 --> 00:44:35.712]  I'm not just saying
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:38.880]  Let's play a clip of Valentine.
[00:44:58.165 --> 00:45:01.408]  I've seen more than all this.
[00:45:02.128 --> 00:45:03.649]  I've been through the rise already.
[00:45:04.109 --> 00:45:06.131]  This right here is not relevant.
[00:45:06.531 --> 00:45:08.312]  They need to have their butts at home.
[00:45:08.813 --> 00:45:13.396]  They need to be in their home units with their family studying and doing something with their life.
[00:45:13.976 --> 00:45:16.818]  Not out here protesting about something that's not really about nothing.
[00:45:17.359 --> 00:45:18.800]  They do not respect
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.302]  This young man's death, you know.
[00:45:22.782 --> 00:45:24.903]  Now, mama and daddy didn't lost a child.
[00:45:25.524 --> 00:45:26.204]  That could be them.
[00:45:27.025 --> 00:45:28.446]  So I'm very pissed.
[00:45:28.466 --> 00:45:29.226]  So what's your name?
[00:45:29.706 --> 00:45:30.467]  Valentine.
[00:45:30.787 --> 00:45:31.788]  And what's your first name?
[00:45:32.028 --> 00:45:32.308]  Robert.
[00:45:32.648 --> 00:45:33.629]  Robert Valentine.
[00:45:33.649 --> 00:45:34.670]  And you're a Vietnam vet?
[00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:34.990]  Yes.
[00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:38.592]  And you just decided to come out here and stand up against these guys?
[00:45:38.652 --> 00:45:38.832]  Yes.
[00:45:41.465 --> 00:45:43.906]  You know, a lot of people would think twice, wouldn't they?
[00:45:44.986 --> 00:45:48.647]  I love my country, I love my charm city, and I'm an American.
[00:45:48.947 --> 00:45:50.728]  I'm not black, white, red or yellow, no.
[00:45:51.308 --> 00:45:51.888]  I am American.
[00:45:52.228 --> 00:45:54.449]  Are you concerned about what's happening to the community?
[00:45:54.689 --> 00:45:54.909]  Yes.
[00:45:55.049 --> 00:45:55.869]  Alright, thank you.
[00:45:56.549 --> 00:46:03.031]  And of course, they shut it down right there, because they didn't like what he was saying, I guess, but... Burn down your own community?
[00:46:03.872 --> 00:46:07.553]  And now I've got a stack of articles where the looters are saying they're going to be shooting cops?
[00:46:07.933 --> 00:46:08.513]  White cops?
[00:46:10.114 --> 00:46:12.215]  I'm really worried about Joe Biggs and Jakari.
[00:46:12.235 --> 00:46:18.336]  We had folks start fights with Jakari as well and call him an Uncle Tom and stuff just because he was there from InfoWars.
[00:46:18.356 --> 00:46:23.758]  Because see, fighting the black genocide via abortion, that's not good.
[00:46:25.038 --> 00:46:28.079]  Going out and looting, that's good because the media said so.
[00:46:28.099 --> 00:46:33.261]  Because Al Sharpton, he has the moral high ground.
[00:46:37.284 --> 00:46:44.788]  Now, continuing here, I want to juxtapose this to the peaceful demonstrations that took place yesterday.
[00:46:44.888 --> 00:47:02.156]  Hundreds of people in Bastrop exposing Jade Helm and Jakari Jackson outside of the convention area, outside of the auditorium, was able to get some of the citizens' take on why they were there, almost to a person, almost to a man, almost to a woman, against what was happening there.
[00:47:03.275 --> 00:47:06.886]  At the preparations for Jade Helm outside Austin, Texas.
[00:47:06.906 --> 00:47:07.247]  Here it is.
[00:47:08.302 --> 00:47:11.843]  Alright, sir, can you tell me what your name is, where you're from, and what brought you out here today?
[00:47:12.183 --> 00:47:13.123]  My name is Daniel Duclue.
[00:47:13.403 --> 00:47:14.543]  I'm from Bastrop, Texas.
[00:47:15.023 --> 00:47:20.805]  I went to school in Austin, and I'm a concerned American Texan, Bastropian.
[00:47:21.085 --> 00:47:31.067]  I just think the government should be held accountable to the decisions they make, and I think it's our privilege and it's our duty as Americans to ask questions about what our government's doing.
[00:47:31.087 --> 00:47:36.668]  These are elected officials, or our judges, not the guy with the army.
[00:47:37.788 --> 00:47:39.970]  You know, I think it's our duty to hold them accountable.
[00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:41.771]  Okay, we're here with Cathy Glass.
[00:47:41.791 --> 00:47:46.054]  You ran for governor this past election, and I was very surprised to see you come out here for this Jade Helm.
[00:47:46.094 --> 00:47:47.355]  Why is it so significant to you?
[00:47:47.735 --> 00:47:55.700]  Well, my husband and I have a small ranch in McDade, so we live half-life in Houston and half-life out here in Lee County, actually.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:59.523]  So what's happening in Bastrop is very important to us, but it's important to all Texans.
[00:47:59.983 --> 00:48:01.804]  This is not just a local thing going on.
[00:48:02.004 --> 00:48:03.766]  What are you going to talk about?
[00:48:03.786 --> 00:48:04.806]  Talking about the drill?
[00:48:04.846 --> 00:48:05.166]  Jade Helm?
[00:48:05.186 --> 00:48:05.367]  Stop.
[00:48:06.387 --> 00:48:08.549]  We're still doing ground rules, correct?
[00:48:08.569 --> 00:48:09.589]  Yeah, I'm still doing it.
[00:48:09.609 --> 00:48:09.810]  Okay.
[00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:10.810]  All right.
[00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:11.651]  Jay Hillman, Bastrop.
[00:48:12.111 --> 00:48:12.491]  Yes, sir.
[00:48:12.631 --> 00:48:12.912]  Okay.
[00:48:13.012 --> 00:48:13.472]  All right.
[00:48:13.512 --> 00:48:14.112]  Anything else?
[00:48:14.413 --> 00:48:15.553]  How many questions are you going to ask?
[00:48:16.214 --> 00:48:18.055]  Did you ask everybody how many questions they're going to ask?
[00:48:18.075 --> 00:48:18.635]  She asked you several.
[00:48:18.695 --> 00:48:20.797]  I'm asking you how many questions do you plan on asking?
[00:48:20.877 --> 00:48:22.658]  Let's say I'll stop at five max.
[00:48:22.798 --> 00:48:23.138]  Five max.
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:24.740]  Three?
[00:48:25.261 --> 00:48:25.461]  Three.
[00:48:25.481 --> 00:48:26.502]  Let's go three.
[00:48:26.883 --> 00:48:29.747]  I'll just have you say and spell your name and position.
[00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:34.113]  Lieutenant Colonel Mark LaStoria, Director of Public Affairs, United States Army Special Operations Command.
[00:48:34.133 --> 00:48:34.954]  All right, Colonel.
[00:48:35.435 --> 00:48:37.197]  You spent a lot of time answering questions.
[00:48:37.237 --> 00:48:38.739]  I'm trying not to be redundant, but just
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.783]  In the most general soundbite sense, what is Jade Helm?
[00:48:43.143 --> 00:48:46.886]  Jade Helm is a training exercise to produce top quality U.S.
[00:48:46.946 --> 00:48:51.189]  Army Special Operations Forces for operations overseas, future operations overseas.
[00:48:51.629 --> 00:48:51.829]  Okay.
[00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:55.132]  And you had a lot of concern here today.
[00:48:56.334 --> 00:48:56.835]  Is it fair to say?
[00:48:57.175 --> 00:49:01.058]  There were a lot of questions asked here today, and I was really supportive of that.
[00:49:01.178 --> 00:49:09.866]  I think local governance is a fantastic thing, and much like the judge said, it'd be great if everybody came out in force like that to all of their meetings.
[00:49:10.266 --> 00:49:11.728]  Local governance is where things happen.
[00:49:12.268 --> 00:49:12.448]  Okay.
[00:49:12.889 --> 00:49:16.472]  Well, it wasn't really a question, it was more of a statement, but I'll try to be as concise as possible.
[00:49:16.492 --> 00:49:20.915]  I just had a question about Metris Global and Thomas Meade, I believe, are involved in this operation.
[00:49:21.096 --> 00:49:21.616]  I'm sorry, who?
[00:49:21.856 --> 00:49:23.197]  Metris Global and Thomas Meade.
[00:49:23.297 --> 00:49:25.820]  I'm not familiar with, what was the first thing again?
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:26.560]  Metris Global.
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:27.521]  No, I'm not familiar with that.
[00:49:27.601 --> 00:49:28.081]  Thomas Meade.
[00:49:28.362 --> 00:49:30.744]  Thomas Meade, he is a coordinator for the exercise.
[00:49:31.204 --> 00:49:34.467]  Alright, I'm here with ZZ Arnetta, former InfoWars reporter.
[00:49:35.147 --> 00:49:39.291]  You are here, you asked a question, what do you think about this Jade Helm operation and also their response to it?
[00:49:39.671 --> 00:49:45.375]  Well, overall, I think I'm mostly disappointed in the way that they let the public know.
[00:49:45.395 --> 00:49:54.381]  I found out about it from the Bastrop County paper on the internet, and it was coming out the same time it came out on InfoWars.
[00:49:55.302 --> 00:50:01.025]  It's like they're saying one thing, and then they're saying another thing at the same time out of both sides of their mouths, so it's confusing.
[00:50:01.045 --> 00:50:01.926]  Yes.
[00:50:01.946 --> 00:50:09.391]  When you're talking about putting people in civilian clothing, I just do not understand what that matters, since this is supposed to be about foreign territory.
[00:50:09.713 --> 00:50:10.904]  I was just concerned with the
[00:50:12.711 --> 00:50:18.093]  Increasing indications that the military is getting a little too involved with local law enforcement.
[00:50:18.673 --> 00:50:37.319]  First of all, we got this military assault vehicle that signed to our Sheriff's Department and then we have all these strange things happening coming in here like this military operation, which is not new for our county because we have Camp Swift and I have helicopters flying over my property all the time.
[00:50:37.339 --> 00:50:38.539]  I don't have any problem with that.
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:40.840]  The thing that
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:48.362]  The indications that are happening that they're getting so involved that it does appear there is some martial law intent.
[00:50:48.822 --> 00:50:52.804]  You know, I think one concern of mine is, well, first of all, I grew up here.
[00:50:52.844 --> 00:50:55.224]  I know Camp Swift is a big military base.
[00:50:55.244 --> 00:50:58.165]  You can see the full report at Infowars.com.
[00:50:58.185 --> 00:50:59.146]  We're also going to tweet it out.
[00:50:59.566 --> 00:51:02.367]  It's citizens fight back against Jade Helm takeover.
[00:51:02.787 --> 00:51:03.787]  That's only a third of it.
[00:51:04.287 --> 00:51:09.229]  We're going to come back with an incredible report by Paul Watson on subliminal message he caught on martial law.
[00:51:09.449 --> 00:51:10.510]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:15.012]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:20.754]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:51:20.854 --> 00:51:24.256]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:52:08.601 --> 00:52:12.006]  Last year, in the Nevada desert, one family took a stand for freedom.
[00:52:12.426 --> 00:52:16.692]  New Mana Food Storage was the first and only company to support the rights of the Bundys.

[00:52:39.944 --> 00:52:44.247]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.

[00:54:23.671 --> 00:54:31.315]  I was going to get to one of the most bone-chilling, bizarro stories I've ever seen.
[00:54:32.675 --> 00:54:40.019]  You know, we're constantly catching subliminal messages on radio, TV, and in print, and documenting them here.
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:46.202]  Just bald-faced subliminal messages that are too quick to consciously pick up.
[00:54:47.998 --> 00:54:53.119]  I'll have to cover this some next hour because we just had some even bigger breaking news.
[00:54:53.139 --> 00:54:58.740]  I mean, I already said it earlier because I already knew it, but now it's been triple confirmed.
[00:55:01.181 --> 00:55:13.163]  But Paul Watson's story is amazing and it's up on Infowars.com right now with the video.
[00:55:15.064 --> 00:55:16.304]  A subliminal message
[00:55:18.126 --> 00:55:41.426]  In an AARP article, story, TV ad, and in the TV ad, the woman is just sitting there knitting, and the voiceover is talking about other things, but then in the background, the TV is talking about riots across America and martial law at a subliminal level, that if you boost the audio, it's as clear as day.
[00:55:42.711 --> 00:55:45.753]  Quote, riots nationwide have prompted local governments to declare martial law.
[00:55:46.113 --> 00:55:49.334]  The president is asking the citizens find safety and remain calm.
[00:55:49.654 --> 00:55:51.455]  Authorities are working to contain the outbreak.
[00:55:54.897 --> 00:55:57.398]  So, there's just massive preparations for martial law.
[00:55:57.418 --> 00:55:58.679]  We've got all the government documents.
[00:55:59.539 --> 00:56:02.841]  Under martial law, they're going to target veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[00:56:02.961 --> 00:56:03.681]  That's all admitted.
[00:56:04.222 --> 00:56:08.184]  And then the army shows up and goes to hundreds of people going, well, you're planning for martial law.
[00:56:08.224 --> 00:56:08.784]  Here's the document.
[00:56:08.984 --> 00:56:09.524]  No, we're not!
[00:56:09.544 --> 00:56:10.365]  It's preposterous!
[00:56:11.581 --> 00:56:12.922]  Hey, they're death panels in Obamacare.
[00:56:12.962 --> 00:56:13.622]  Here's the subsection.
[00:56:13.822 --> 00:56:14.542]  Shut up, racist.
[00:56:17.744 --> 00:56:18.704]  Hey, you're raising the debt limit.
[00:56:18.884 --> 00:56:19.344]  No, we're not.
[00:56:20.765 --> 00:56:21.445]  Doesn't raise the debt.
[00:56:21.786 --> 00:56:22.646]  But it does raise the debt.
[00:56:22.666 --> 00:56:22.926]  No, it doesn't.
[00:56:24.027 --> 00:56:24.527]  Well, yeah, it does.
[00:56:24.687 --> 00:56:25.047]  No, it doesn't.
[00:56:26.488 --> 00:56:27.808]  I mean, it's getting crazy.
[00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:30.690]  But on the dumbed-down public, this stuff works.
[00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:32.050]  It's all a confidence game.
[00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:38.053]  He's in the military uniform, or he's in the government outfit, and they're telling us this, so it must be true.
[00:56:39.571 --> 00:56:40.873]  Kit Daniels dug into it.
[00:56:40.893 --> 00:56:47.586]  I mean, I knew just from past study that Baltimore is one of the most federally controlled cities other than D.C.
[00:56:47.646 --> 00:56:48.127]  in the country.
[00:56:50.482 --> 00:56:55.745]  And they just roll out forced inoculations there outside of law, you name it, time and time again.
[00:56:56.265 --> 00:57:03.028]  And I knew this lady was in deep with Obama, so I just said, this is just a department run, because I know they got their people there, that's been confirmed.
[00:57:03.348 --> 00:57:04.169]  Because it always is.
[00:57:04.209 --> 00:57:06.210]  But I kind of went with my gut.
[00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:10.372]  I mean, that was my opinion, based on giant piles of knowledge.
[00:57:11.252 --> 00:57:12.553]  Well, here it is, breaking.
[00:57:12.613 --> 00:57:16.276]  Baltimore Mayor, key player in Obama's federal takeover of local police.
[00:57:16.976 --> 00:57:22.960]  One of only three people involved in the quote, task force that gave the recommendation for total federalization.
[00:57:24.001 --> 00:57:26.723]  On the back of the problems in Ferguson.
[00:57:27.023 --> 00:57:29.845]  Oh, the answer is federalize the police because they're so racist.
[00:57:30.645 --> 00:57:34.508]  Mayor's link to the Justice Department explains why she gave rioters space to destroy.
[00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:39.872]  They're getting ready to kick off a long, hot summer.
[00:57:40.717 --> 00:57:48.402]  And then cops are gonna get trigger fingers, black ones, white ones, blacks are gonna get shot, and all hell's gonna break loose.
[00:57:49.483 --> 00:57:59.630]  This is just how George Soros took down Ukraine, it's how they took down Egypt, it's how they tried to take down Syria, it's how they took down Libya, this is how they do it, is sectarian war.
[00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:07.876]  It could be religious, it could be racial, it could be cultural, it could be regional, it could be old beefs, sectarian manipulation!
[00:58:08.735 --> 00:58:09.576]  Coming up, I never got to it.
[00:58:09.596 --> 00:58:11.017]  I'm going to give you the definition of a thug.
[00:58:11.417 --> 00:58:12.378]  Thug isn't racist.
[00:58:12.438 --> 00:58:21.206]  Thug comes from a group of Arab bandits that would rob the Silk Road out of India through Arabia and were known for garroting people, choking them to death.
[00:58:21.506 --> 00:58:22.287]  The thuggy.
[00:58:22.307 --> 00:58:26.130]  And that's why they say that guy's a thug.
[00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:27.071]  It just means bandit.
[00:58:28.098 --> 00:58:29.519]  And the people out there looting.
[00:58:29.679 --> 00:58:32.540]  Look at the white soccer fans that loot and rob.
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:34.341]  Oh, people call them thugs.
[00:58:34.641 --> 00:58:35.421]  Oh, racist!
[00:58:36.061 --> 00:58:37.882]  No, they're attacking language itself.
[00:58:38.362 --> 00:58:39.623]  I didn't plug any of our products.
[00:58:39.843 --> 00:58:41.283]  We got the biggest sales going ever.

[00:59:03.007 --> 00:59:03.087]  Mine!
[00:59:29.665 --> 00:59:30.425]  I think so.
[01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:04.239]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.629 --> 01:00:19.794]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:20.475 --> 01:00:21.275]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.056 --> 01:00:22.937]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.598 --> 01:00:27.222]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.803 --> 01:00:31.847]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.269 --> 01:00:37.229]  Why is J.P.
[01:00:37.269 --> 01:00:39.771]  Morgan hoarding 50 million ounces of silver?
[01:00:39.811 --> 01:00:42.552]  That's one question we'll be asking you.
[01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:47.394]  We'll look at the economy and geopolitical developments with Max Keiser having been on a few months.
[01:00:48.574 --> 01:00:57.718]  I also intend to open the telephones up and take some of your calls in the second half of our discussion with Keiser.
[01:00:58.979 --> 01:01:05.462]  You can also tweet your questions at RealAlexJones and we'll get some of those on air as well.
[01:01:08.558 --> 01:01:10.579]  There's so much to get to in this hour.
[01:01:10.599 --> 01:01:26.508]  I'm going to break down more thoroughly the definition of thug, because it doesn't matter if the Baltimore mayor playing both sides who allowed the looting to intensify now has declared a civil emergency in the city along with the governor over the state and curfews.
[01:01:27.009 --> 01:01:36.134]  She's called them thugs, but we've got different, quote, black activists and the drummer for The Late Show and others coming out saying it's code word for the n-word.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:39.981]  No, it's code word for thugs.
[01:01:43.603 --> 01:01:44.204]  The thuggy.
[01:01:44.224 --> 01:01:49.167]  Hindi refers to thugs, organized gang of professional assassins.
[01:01:49.548 --> 01:01:51.969]  The thugs traveled in groups across Asia for 600 years.
[01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:59.094]  Although the thugs trace their origin to seven Muslim tribes, Hindus appear to have been associated with them in an early period.
[01:01:59.955 --> 01:02:06.960]  They were first mentioned in Zia-ud-Din Brahmi's history
[01:02:08.215 --> 01:02:10.157]  of the Firsu Shah.
[01:02:10.217 --> 01:02:11.077]  I know I butchered that.
[01:02:11.558 --> 01:02:12.078]  Dated around 1356.
[01:02:12.739 --> 01:02:22.527]  In the 1830s, they were targeted for eradication by William Benechik, Governor General of India, and his chief captain, William Henry Saleem.
[01:02:23.488 --> 01:02:26.290]  The Thuggies were seemingly destroyed by this effort.
[01:02:27.571 --> 01:02:30.152]  The thugs would join travelers and gain their confidence.
[01:02:30.593 --> 01:02:36.896]  This would allow them surprise and strangle their victims by pulling a handkerchief or noose tied around their necks.
[01:02:36.936 --> 01:02:39.657]  They would then rob their victims of valuables and bury their bodies.
[01:02:40.178 --> 01:02:44.980]  This led them to also be called English for using the noose.
[01:02:45.961 --> 01:02:46.601]  How do you say that?
[01:02:46.781 --> 01:02:48.002]  Fan Singar.
[01:02:48.882 --> 01:02:51.163]  A term more commonly used in Southern India.
[01:02:51.784 --> 01:02:55.646]  The term thuggy is derived from the Hindi word which means deceiver.
[01:02:56.792 --> 01:03:04.615]  Related words are the verb, thungenan, to deceive, or cunning, sly, fraudulent.
[01:03:06.395 --> 01:03:13.738]  The term for a particular kind of murder or robbery of travelers is popular in South Asia and particularly in India still today.
[01:03:15.339 --> 01:03:17.939]  And it was a gang history and recruitment.
[01:03:17.959 --> 01:03:21.341]  But hey, who needs science and history and words?
[01:03:21.361 --> 01:03:22.501]  You can just say racist!
[01:03:23.321 --> 01:03:24.862]  I don't like the flavor of this food, racist!
[01:03:26.348 --> 01:03:27.208]  I don't want to rent to you.
[01:03:27.268 --> 01:03:28.569]  You look and act like a thug.
[01:03:28.689 --> 01:03:29.169]  Racist.
[01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:32.811]  I want to have my own choice in life.
[01:03:33.031 --> 01:03:33.471]  Racist.
[01:03:34.091 --> 01:03:36.633]  I don't want to have death panels and put veterans on no treat list.
[01:03:36.893 --> 01:03:37.333]  Racist.
[01:03:37.673 --> 01:03:38.633]  I don't want to turn my guns in.
[01:03:38.753 --> 01:03:39.214]  Racist.
[01:03:39.574 --> 01:03:47.817]  And you can feel all intellectual and like you're using some magic word like Ooga Booga or Alakazam or Hocus Pocus.
[01:03:50.659 --> 01:03:53.060]  What is that one episode of Looney Tunes where
[01:03:53.959 --> 01:03:57.027]  Bugs Bunny goes to the castle and Count Dracula is trying to eat him.
[01:03:58.291 --> 01:04:00.015]  But he gets the magic book and keeps...
[01:04:01.479 --> 01:04:07.700]  Reading out of it's got some really funny, funny ones that he says in there and different things happen to Count Dracula when he says it.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.500]  I mean, but you know what?
[01:04:09.681 --> 01:04:10.981]  I laugh at it, you laugh at it.
[01:04:11.501 --> 01:04:14.421]  It works on half the public that man, hey, you know what I say?
[01:04:14.461 --> 01:04:14.942]  I call you racist.
[01:04:14.962 --> 01:04:15.262]  Yes, sir.
[01:04:15.282 --> 01:04:16.942]  Please don't do that.
[01:04:17.302 --> 01:04:18.242]  I need your approval.
[01:04:18.402 --> 01:04:20.282]  I need to be lectured to by you.
[01:04:20.363 --> 01:04:24.523]  I need Rachel Maddow to sit up there because she's got a short haircut.
[01:04:25.784 --> 01:04:28.124]  Anyone with a short haircut, you better bow down.
[01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:33.908]  In fact, let's play a little bit of this right now.
[01:04:33.948 --> 01:04:34.649]  This is more important.
[01:04:34.849 --> 01:04:35.769]  Let's go out to break with this.
[01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:36.129]  Go ahead.
[01:04:37.169 --> 01:04:37.929]  Let me fade up the audio.
[01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:39.690]  Sorry, we have no sound from that computer.
[01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:41.210]  Oh, we don't have sound from that computer?
[01:04:41.971 --> 01:04:44.211]  He goes, my goodness, the mosquito's in this place!
[01:04:44.271 --> 01:04:45.732]  And, like, slaps this.
[01:04:46.652 --> 01:04:50.073]  I don't let my kids watch a lot of TV, but I let them watch these old Looney Tunes.
[01:04:50.093 --> 01:04:54.054]  I will crush you!
[01:04:54.094 --> 01:04:54.994]  I like that one part.
[01:04:58.595 --> 01:05:01.256]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:01.276 --> 01:05:01.736]  Stay with us.
[01:05:05.658 --> 01:05:06.659]  Max Keiser is coming up.
[01:05:09.803 --> 01:05:16.150]  Not a single 11th grade student showed up to take the SBAC Common Core standardized test at Nathan Hale High School last week.
[01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:19.133]  But students aren't the only ones walking out on Common Core.
[01:05:19.353 --> 01:05:24.599]  Earlier this year, teachers at the same school passed a resolution against the Common Core standardized tests and were
[01:05:24.599 --> 01:05:25.199]  We're good to go.
[01:05:48.598 --> 01:05:50.619]  ...in which they feel they want to comply with, he said.
[01:05:50.859 --> 01:05:54.840]  Technical issues are plaguing the Common Core testing industry even worse than student walkouts.
[01:05:55.081 --> 01:06:01.183]  The Washington Post reports that over 15 states are suspending, scrapping, or reviewing Common Core standards for a variety of reasons.
[01:06:01.403 --> 01:06:04.304]  Maybe the computers are having trouble calculating 2 plus 2 equals 5.

[01:07:09.367 --> 01:07:10.308]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:07:10.468 --> 01:07:14.291]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds.
[01:07:14.732 --> 01:07:16.433]  I lift weights five days a week.
[01:07:16.834 --> 01:07:18.155]  I can swim two, three miles.
[01:07:18.495 --> 01:07:21.418]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[01:07:21.658 --> 01:07:23.239]  I started an access television show.
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:28.424]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[01:07:29.004 --> 01:07:31.867]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[01:07:32.387 --> 01:07:38.089]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:43.292]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[01:07:43.712 --> 01:07:48.594]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[01:07:48.874 --> 01:07:55.955]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Group for Infowarslife.com, the results were incredible.
[01:07:56.275 --> 01:08:01.416]  Take the Infowarslife.com challenge today at Infowarslife.com or give our crew a call.

[01:08:04.617 --> 01:08:06.117]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:06.137 --> 01:08:12.998]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:21.676 --> 01:08:22.797]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:08:22.817 --> 01:08:27.879]  We're now into the second hour on this live Tuesday, the 28th of May, already of April 2015.
[01:08:27.919 --> 01:08:40.686]  We'll have some of your questions from Twitter at RealAlexJones, if you tweet those at us, for Max Keiser at the bottom of the hour, and some of your economic or geopolitical questions specifically for Max Keiser.
[01:08:41.066 --> 01:08:42.386]  The toll-free number to join us is
[01:08:44.428 --> 01:08:44.688]  800-259-9231.
[01:08:46.429 --> 01:08:51.231]  First-time callers and just questions, not statements because of time.
[01:08:52.011 --> 01:08:53.232]  For Max Keiser.
[01:08:53.252 --> 01:08:53.292]  800-259-9231.
[01:08:57.782 --> 01:09:07.807]  Syndicated radio host, TV host, stockbroker, analyst, overall interesting fella, smart guy is joining us here in just a moment.
[01:09:08.207 --> 01:09:12.930]  I'm going to get his take on the Russia situation, on the domestic situation.
[01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:21.534]  Why is JPMorgan Chase hoarding 50 million ounces of silver as Zero Hedge reported?
[01:09:22.314 --> 01:09:25.416]  We've seen all this economic data that the economy worldwide is sliding.
[01:09:26.972 --> 01:09:27.972]  What does this really mean?
[01:09:28.032 --> 01:09:30.393]  But meanwhile, breaking!
[01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:31.974]  This is on Infowars.com.
[01:09:32.534 --> 01:09:36.095]  Baltimore Mayor, key player in Obama's federal takeover of local police.
[01:09:36.936 --> 01:09:41.157]  She's the one calling for the response to riots in Stephen Ferguson for federalization.
[01:09:41.638 --> 01:09:42.598]  She's on the task force.
[01:09:43.809 --> 01:09:44.709]  Only three people are.
[01:09:44.929 --> 01:09:45.390]  Three mayors.
[01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:50.212]  Mayor Link to Justice Department explains why she gave rioters space to destroy.
[01:09:50.232 --> 01:09:53.173]  And if you just tuned in, we played it like four times last hour.
[01:09:53.193 --> 01:09:54.093]  We'll play it again in a moment.
[01:09:54.833 --> 01:09:57.054]  She said we gave people a space to riot.
[01:09:57.334 --> 01:09:57.835]  Here's the deal.
[01:10:00.035 --> 01:10:01.536]  There is police brutality.
[01:10:01.796 --> 01:10:04.957]  There are a lot of corrupt departments where bad cops get away with stuff.
[01:10:05.017 --> 01:10:06.078]  But on average,
[01:10:07.199 --> 01:10:14.144]  The average cop is just a revenue generator who also responds to crime, and it's a horrible job and I wouldn't want it.
[01:10:15.464 --> 01:10:22.289]  And the establishment has been caught funding and financing demonstrations here to get us all fighting with each other.
[01:10:22.889 --> 01:10:29.814]  No one can deny that they knew a revolution was coming in the Middle East, a legitimate one, so they triggered it, the Arab Spring,
[01:10:31.963 --> 01:10:33.924]  And then they put radicals in instead of reformers.
[01:10:34.524 --> 01:10:36.124]  So they hijack legitimate movements.
[01:10:36.524 --> 01:10:37.525]  They know what they're doing.
[01:10:38.005 --> 01:10:39.185]  Black unemployment has doubled.
[01:10:39.225 --> 01:10:47.348]  Look, I'm nonpartisan, but under Obama, they've been able to really, in the Democratic Party, give black people the short end of the stick.
[01:10:48.648 --> 01:10:50.609]  Because, hey, you gotta support him anyways.
[01:10:50.629 --> 01:10:51.589]  They've been taken for granted.
[01:10:53.097 --> 01:10:56.838]  But they find poll numbers go up if they can get some racial stuff going.
[01:10:57.478 --> 01:11:00.139]  Now when a black cop shoots a black guy, it's not hardly in the news.
[01:11:00.179 --> 01:11:02.340]  Or a black cop shoots a white guy, it's not in the news.
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:12.443]  But a white guy shoots a black guy, I mean, they've indicted the cop that shot the black guy in the back a few weeks ago.
[01:11:13.963 --> 01:11:15.644]  Most of the time they get indicted and go to jail.
[01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:19.692]  So, why is this the only issue in the world?
[01:11:19.732 --> 01:11:21.093]  That and transgender bathrooms.
[01:11:22.274 --> 01:11:28.799]  The universe is not just about transgender and, you know, a black person getting shot once a week in the back.
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:31.321]  And I'm sad you got shot in the back.
[01:11:32.022 --> 01:11:38.667]  But, I mean, 52% of blacks never got out of mama, and I don't find any black people that are, quote, liberals that care about that.
[01:11:38.687 --> 01:11:41.850]  I mean, Black Lives Matter demonstrations outside Planned Parenthood.
[01:11:44.164 --> 01:11:44.884]  It's just crazy.
[01:11:45.325 --> 01:11:49.066]  And then if you call these looters thugs, I mean, you notice you don't see any white reporters out there.
[01:11:49.086 --> 01:11:50.067]  That's because they get attacked.
[01:11:50.207 --> 01:11:51.147]  They've been getting attacked.
[01:11:52.368 --> 01:11:53.689]  But CNN won't point that out.
[01:11:55.069 --> 01:12:00.612]  This is how British-controlled countries, through sectarianism, through divide and conquer,
[01:12:01.986 --> 01:12:03.988]  And now they've declared civil emergency.
[01:12:04.948 --> 01:12:07.550]  They're saying you can't be out after dark for adults as well.
[01:12:07.911 --> 01:12:09.812]  See, first it was for the youth already in place.
[01:12:10.152 --> 01:12:11.133]  Didn't keep them from looting.
[01:12:11.553 --> 01:12:12.454]  Now it's for everybody.
[01:12:13.175 --> 01:12:14.476]  And this will be the new 9-11.
[01:12:14.556 --> 01:12:15.777]  Big riots this summer.
[01:12:16.297 --> 01:12:17.818]  You can tell that's where this is going.
[01:12:19.239 --> 01:12:22.182]  And then there'll be reforms, which is federalization of police.
[01:12:23.564 --> 01:12:27.747]  The very feds that train the cops how to act like paramilitary, and who are giving them the weapons.
[01:12:27.787 --> 01:12:29.789]  So, it's a problem, reaction, solution.
[01:12:30.069 --> 01:12:33.452]  Fund Al Qaeda, they attack us, take your liberties.
[01:12:34.112 --> 01:12:39.357]  Fund radical black groups to go out and do stuff, then you get to federalize the police, take liberties.
[01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:41.959]  I mean, it's the same story over and over again.
[01:12:42.319 --> 01:12:44.341]  That's my breakdown on the situation.
[01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:50.485]  But here is the mayor saying, we provided an area for the people to basically destroy.
[01:12:50.525 --> 01:12:50.966]  Here's the clip.
[01:12:53.403 --> 01:12:58.047]  We also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well.
[01:12:58.747 --> 01:13:07.814]  And we worked very hard to keep that balance and to put ourselves in the best position to de-escalate.
[01:13:07.954 --> 01:13:08.815]  And that's what you saw.
[01:13:10.716 --> 01:13:17.942]  And it also makes the entire black culture about grandstanding when you're wronged instead of just being successful in life and business.
[01:13:18.562 --> 01:13:20.744]  You've got a city almost completely run by black people.
[01:13:21.963 --> 01:13:24.704]  And still, it's white racist killed the black person.
[01:13:28.186 --> 01:13:33.789]  The whole universe does not revolve around a few hundred black men shot every year.
[01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:37.831]  And then you got thousands shot by blacks and nobody cares.
[01:13:38.771 --> 01:13:41.032]  Something like 14,000 blacks are shot by blacks every year.
[01:13:41.272 --> 01:13:41.813]  Look up the number.
[01:13:42.213 --> 01:13:44.114]  I mean, it's just a total diversion.
[01:13:46.305 --> 01:13:47.546]  There's a whole universe around us.
[01:13:47.746 --> 01:13:51.689]  We're busy just looking at these petty issues, which they make the biggest issues in the world.
[01:13:52.029 --> 01:13:53.670]  Nobody fights the police state more than I do.
[01:13:54.230 --> 01:14:01.575]  I want to get Max Keiser and Max Keiser's take on all this, then we'll get into just a huge amount of news he wants to cover.
[01:14:02.656 --> 01:14:02.896]  U.S.
[01:14:02.916 --> 01:14:04.757]  defense industry outperforms S&P by 100%.
[01:14:04.797 --> 01:14:10.941]  We're going to get into Montana's second state to slow police militarization.
[01:14:11.261 --> 01:14:13.243]  See, that's conservative areas that are trying to stop that.
[01:14:14.793 --> 01:14:17.141]  There's people moving against the NSA system.
[01:14:17.161 --> 01:14:18.225]  That's the Tea Party doing that.
[01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:21.223]  Kaiser wants to get into a whole host of issues.
[01:14:21.543 --> 01:14:23.284]  Max Kaiser, first off, thanks for joining us.
[01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:23.905]  It's been a while.
[01:14:23.925 --> 01:14:27.747]  I'm going to skip this network break so we have more time, and you get back the time we just missed.
[01:14:28.808 --> 01:14:33.351]  You've got a new report out, The Age of False Prophets, that's excellent at MaxKaiser.com.
[01:14:33.631 --> 01:14:34.552]  Folks should go watch that.
[01:14:34.572 --> 01:14:35.753]  We may even play a clip of that later.
[01:14:36.694 --> 01:14:46.240]  But you just heard my five-minute rant about what I think is going on behind this obsession with rioting and looting and police officers.
[01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:47.581]  What do you think's behind it?
[01:14:48.834 --> 01:14:49.935]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:14:50.215 --> 01:14:51.136]  How's my sound, by the way?
[01:14:51.156 --> 01:14:52.657]  I'm trying out a new phone, okay?
[01:14:52.717 --> 01:14:53.758]  You sound great, Max.
[01:14:53.798 --> 01:14:54.418]  Good to have you here.
[01:14:54.478 --> 01:14:55.759]  Where are you joining us from?
[01:14:55.779 --> 01:15:11.951]  I am in London, and I moved here two and a half years ago, and I don't know if you remember, but when I was on your show two and a half years ago, three years ago, I used to tell you about the fact that we did the show, we shared a studio with Voice of America.
[01:15:12.451 --> 01:15:15.914]  That's right, I have the article right here about Voice of America is having big problems right now.
[01:15:16.892 --> 01:15:18.353]  Yeah.
[01:15:18.434 --> 01:15:22.778]  You know, and at the time, you know, they're basically falling apart.
[01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:23.959]  The sky is leaving.
[01:15:24.039 --> 01:15:25.981]  David Ensor just left.
[01:15:26.942 --> 01:15:34.930]  And the thing about Voice of America is they were having trouble competing with RT and Press TV.
[01:15:35.010 --> 01:15:36.791]  And I was doing a show on both of those networks.
[01:15:37.792 --> 01:15:41.476]  And Voice of America was, you know, coming on to me saying,
[01:15:42.119 --> 01:15:44.020]  You gotta work for Voice of America.
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.800]  Come on over to Voice of America.
[01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:48.861]  And I said, no, you know, you guys are just propaganda.
[01:15:49.901 --> 01:15:54.023]  And then, uh, the offers started to come in for money.
[01:15:54.043 --> 01:15:57.544]  Uh, the amounts of money started to get bigger.
[01:15:58.544 --> 01:16:01.325]  And I kept saying, no, no, you guys are propaganda.
[01:16:01.665 --> 01:16:02.145]  You don't get it.
[01:16:02.205 --> 01:16:02.805]  I do news.
[01:16:03.085 --> 01:16:04.246]  You guys are propaganda.
[01:16:05.246 --> 01:16:11.148]  And then, you know, I started hearing about these, our correspondents at RT being approached
[01:16:12.031 --> 01:16:17.775]  By Voice of America and these other folks like the Broadcasting Board of Governor folks.
[01:16:18.655 --> 01:16:21.737]  And then before you know it, this Liz Wall thing went down.
[01:16:23.419 --> 01:16:27.421]  So, I said to myself, they finally found one.
[01:16:28.382 --> 01:16:29.463]  They finally nabbed one.
[01:16:30.924 --> 01:16:33.565]  So, I don't know what the quid pro quo was.
[01:16:33.826 --> 01:16:35.927]  I know the numbers they were throwing at me were pretty big.
[01:16:36.866 --> 01:16:38.968]  I can only imagine the numbers they threw at her.
[01:16:39.048 --> 01:16:51.558]  Sure, did you see the RT reporter that you're talking about, who did that whole stage thing that she quit, testifying before Congress, we played it last week, saying basically, get rid of free speech and that evil alternative media must be stopped?
[01:16:52.038 --> 01:16:53.139]  They asked me to do that.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.662]  Wait a minute, you're breaking major news.
[01:16:56.902 --> 01:17:00.986]  You're saying you were approached to do a stage defection from RT.
[01:17:01.526 --> 01:17:01.726]  Yeah.
[01:17:02.407 --> 01:17:04.769]  And I used to talk to you on the show like two and a half years ago.
[01:17:05.069 --> 01:17:08.031]  We shared a studio with Voice of America.
[01:17:08.432 --> 01:17:10.333]  I remember, I used to dial in and you were there.
[01:17:10.353 --> 01:17:12.055]  Okay, you've got the floor.
[01:17:13.096 --> 01:17:13.796]  Tell us what happened.
[01:17:15.658 --> 01:17:17.760]  Well, exactly what I just said.
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:19.521]  And I've said it on your show before.
[01:17:20.422 --> 01:17:21.783]  When we were doing our show in Paris,
[01:17:22.791 --> 01:17:24.592]  We shared a studio with the Voice of America.
[01:17:25.173 --> 01:17:26.974]  And they would come on and they would do their propaganda.
[01:17:27.254 --> 01:17:29.475]  And they would say, you know what, you should be a Patriot.
[01:17:29.556 --> 01:17:31.357]  You shouldn't be doing RT or Press TV.
[01:17:31.377 --> 01:17:32.577]  You need to be doing Voice of America.
[01:17:32.618 --> 01:17:35.239]  I said, no, you guys are pure propaganda.
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:43.144]  So then as RT started to get more and more popular, they started coming back to me with, come on over.
[01:17:43.284 --> 01:17:45.446]  And they start talking about doing like a staged
[01:17:46.252 --> 01:17:49.876]  On air, defection, and it's going to be worth your while.
[01:17:50.396 --> 01:17:53.940]  And they started talking about some sums of money that were not insignificant.
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:56.602]  I kept saying, no, you don't get it.
[01:17:57.243 --> 01:17:58.524]  You guys are propaganda.
[01:17:58.985 --> 01:17:59.725]  I'm a journalist.
[01:17:59.745 --> 01:18:00.766]  That's two different things.
[01:18:01.687 --> 01:18:09.675]  But then when the Liz Wall thing went down, I'm like, I checked around and they're like, yeah, you know, as we all knew, eventually they would find the weak spot.
[01:18:12.467 --> 01:18:24.510]  Well, Max, I didn't know when you were coming on today I wanted to bring up Voice of America, where I know you were studioed out of in Paris, because we used to connect to you there via Skype to do interviews, with a beautiful shot of the city behind you.
[01:18:25.210 --> 01:18:26.490]  This is simply amazing.
[01:18:26.530 --> 01:18:28.111]  You're a major accredited reporter.
[01:18:29.051 --> 01:18:39.521]  Saying that fully a year before she did her stage defection, they came to you and asked you to stage the same event and say that RT was a fraud and controlled what you were saying.
[01:18:39.561 --> 01:18:45.866]  And I mean, did they go that far to have you basically script what you were going to say or were they just seeing if you would do it?
[01:18:47.288 --> 01:18:52.392]  Well, as it wasn't just me, mind you, there's a couple of other people as well.
[01:18:52.572 --> 01:18:54.294]  And we kind of shared notes about this.
[01:18:55.314 --> 01:18:58.835]  And, uh, we knew that eventually they would find a weak spot.
[01:18:58.955 --> 01:19:02.236]  We just didn't know... Who approached you, and what did they say exactly?
[01:19:03.337 --> 01:19:05.997]  Well, it's Voice of America, so they have a facility in Paris.
[01:19:06.758 --> 01:19:11.359]  And they did, we would do our show, and then they came into the studio, and they did their show.
[01:19:12.682 --> 01:19:14.523]  So in every couple of months, it's somebody new.
[01:19:14.923 --> 01:19:16.804]  Because nobody wants to work for Voice of America.
[01:19:16.864 --> 01:19:17.724]  Because they're failing.
[01:19:17.844 --> 01:19:25.567]  Because their message is... I know, but specifically, can you say, if you don't want to say, I totally understand, because they may have said it was in confidence, but were you approached by the news director?
[01:19:25.587 --> 01:19:28.668]  Were you approached by the folks you're releasing the time from and their satellite equipment?
[01:19:28.949 --> 01:19:34.391]  I mean, did they say, hey, Max, you're on a stage of defection, you know, around the coffee cooler?
[01:19:34.431 --> 01:19:34.991]  I mean, what happened?
[01:19:35.469 --> 01:19:38.691]  Well, they were trying to arrange a meeting with this guy David Ensor.
[01:19:39.191 --> 01:19:40.171]  I'll tell you that.
[01:19:40.352 --> 01:19:42.593]  And like, this is the guy who you need to talk to.
[01:19:42.633 --> 01:19:47.355]  And I said, you know, I don't need to talk to any of those people, because you guys are pure propagandists.
[01:19:48.276 --> 01:19:49.076]  And I'm a journalist.
[01:19:49.116 --> 01:19:50.037]  That's a big difference.
[01:19:50.417 --> 01:19:55.640]  You guys have... So here we are in 2015, and they're ramping up this war, you know, against
[01:20:00.859 --> 01:20:05.004]  Yeah, they've said that in Congress, and they've claimed I'm a Russian agent, all because I don't support World War III.
[01:20:20.706 --> 01:20:24.990]  We provide people with, like Luke Rutkowski, who's an excellent reporter.
[01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:26.351]  He's been on your show many times.
[01:20:26.391 --> 01:20:27.472]  He's been on my show many times.
[01:20:27.492 --> 01:20:30.775]  He just did a fantastic report about what's really going on in Ukraine.
[01:20:31.295 --> 01:20:39.402]  That there's a kill list that the Ukrainian government is publishing online, and then these people are getting murdered.
[01:20:40.102 --> 01:20:41.804]  And these people are supported by the U.S.
[01:20:41.824 --> 01:20:45.107]  This kill list is being generated by the U.S.
[01:20:45.127 --> 01:20:48.970]  And that's who the Voice of America wants the world to support.
[01:20:49.528 --> 01:20:54.993]  And if you don't follow that narrative, you are somehow with ISIS or Alex Jones.
[01:20:55.654 --> 01:20:57.775]  And we're being attacked along those lines.
[01:20:57.835 --> 01:21:04.942]  Meanwhile, RT continues to get bigger and bigger and bigger because we're just doing the job of journalism.
[01:21:07.847 --> 01:21:17.389]  Well, I mean, this wall lady, it was so staged, she goes, I'm quitting, this place is propaganda, and obviously it leans towards Putin, and I think it's a little too leftist.
[01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:21.951]  The shows are varied, but I know that I've been on there probably 200 times, never been censored.
[01:21:22.731 --> 01:21:29.713]  I know that you put out stuff, it's hardcore, it's truthful, it's geopolitical, it's from an individual's perspective.
[01:21:29.993 --> 01:21:31.333]  It isn't Russian-leaning.
[01:21:33.394 --> 01:21:40.519]  It's just, I've also been on the BBC probably 50 times, and Japanese TV, you know, it doesn't mean I promote their ideas.
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:44.442]  By RT, I have been censored by the BBC.
[01:21:45.103 --> 01:21:47.104]  The BBC aggressively censored me.
[01:21:47.144 --> 01:21:57.712]  The BBC is the only network I've worked for, and I've worked for networks all over the world, who came to me before I did my show and said, these are the things you can talk about, these are the things you can't talk about.
[01:21:58.511 --> 01:22:02.092]  You unequivocally cannot mention Israel in any context.
[01:22:02.312 --> 01:22:04.532]  For example, the BBC told me point-blank.
[01:22:04.993 --> 01:22:07.633]  A guy named Paul Gibbs told me that point-blank.
[01:22:08.353 --> 01:22:11.314]  And they had other lists of things that you can and cannot say.
[01:22:11.534 --> 01:22:15.075]  Now no other network has ever approached me and done anything like that.
[01:22:15.595 --> 01:22:21.096]  And RT has been the most editorially free environment I've ever been involved with.
[01:22:21.996 --> 01:22:24.237]  And so they just want to get the news out there.
[01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:28.129]  Uh, you know, it's the difference between being state-funded and state-directed.
[01:22:28.269 --> 01:22:35.612]  You know, those, uh, uh, Sony hacks of the emails that just came out show that the government in the United States works directly with Hollywood.
[01:22:36.053 --> 01:22:36.553]  Sure.
[01:22:36.793 --> 01:22:40.094]  It's not state-run, it's state-directed, exactly.
[01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:41.735]  It's a puppeteer operation.
[01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:44.237]  The Russians are open about funding RT.
[01:22:45.057 --> 01:22:46.898]  State-funded doesn't mean state-directed.
[01:22:47.695 --> 01:22:51.136]  There's no international news organization that's not state-funded.
[01:22:51.316 --> 01:22:52.257]  They're all state-funded.
[01:22:52.497 --> 01:23:00.139]  BBC, RT, Press TV, Al Jazeera, and then you have the networks in America are state-directed.
[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:01.740]  Well, and they're state-funded.
[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:05.641]  CNN, MSNBC, they were all given government satellites.
[01:23:05.661 --> 01:23:07.302]  They were all given government support.
[01:23:08.022 --> 01:23:10.163]  They're given government bailouts, stimulus money.
[01:23:10.463 --> 01:23:11.363]  They're government-funded.
[01:23:11.383 --> 01:23:13.004]  They're going to come from the government.
[01:23:13.144 --> 01:23:13.764]  That's the point.
[01:23:14.745 --> 01:23:15.605]  Plus their subsidies.
[01:23:16.748 --> 01:23:21.370]  To say, for example, that RT has state funding, who cares?
[01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:25.311]  As long as the state's not directing the content, which I can tell you that they're not.
[01:23:25.471 --> 01:23:30.112]  In my case, and I've been there for five years, I've done 750 shows and I've talked to every journalist over there.
[01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:34.914]  The only situation I've seen that's been rotten is the one I just described to you.
[01:23:34.934 --> 01:23:38.655]  Well, since you've told us this, I remember you mentioning it a few years ago and I was
[01:23:40.225 --> 01:23:42.566]  Yeah, it's just, I mean, I know you tell the truth, but there's so much.
[01:23:42.626 --> 01:23:43.886]  I'm like, really, Max Keiser?
[01:23:43.926 --> 01:23:45.187]  I know you're at Voice of America.
[01:23:45.667 --> 01:23:47.527]  I see the Skype handle when we connect.
[01:23:48.288 --> 01:23:49.568]  I know you're using their studios.
[01:23:50.228 --> 01:23:52.409]  Yeah, now you're saying they want you to stage a defection.
[01:23:52.689 --> 01:23:55.870]  We ought to find that clip from like two years ago, because this is big news.
[01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:57.411]  Now you bring it up.
[01:23:58.271 --> 01:24:00.412]  I don't want to break confidence with our team.
[01:24:01.372 --> 01:24:03.153]  There's been never any secret discussions.
[01:24:03.654 --> 01:24:06.175]  I've been in their offices in L.A.
[01:24:06.956 --> 01:24:11.919]  I've been at their offices once in D.C.
[01:24:11.939 --> 01:24:14.000]  or outside D.C.
[01:24:14.801 --> 01:24:15.841]  and I was just left alone.
[01:24:15.861 --> 01:24:25.668]  I talked about whatever I wanted to, but I was told by one of their high-level correspondents and then by one of their major directors, I'll leave it at that, that the guy that started our team
[01:24:26.849 --> 01:24:28.551]  Every time I hear that rumor, I have you on my show.
[01:24:55.279 --> 01:24:56.280]  And that's been my policy.
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:57.621]  And I'll have you on right now.
[01:24:57.761 --> 01:24:59.063]  You can come on my show next week.
[01:24:59.823 --> 01:25:02.206]  Anytime that rumor floats, you come on my show.
[01:25:02.306 --> 01:25:03.947]  And I've got the most popular show on RT.
[01:25:04.068 --> 01:25:04.668]  I know you do.
[01:25:04.728 --> 01:25:05.349]  Millions of people.
[01:25:05.369 --> 01:25:06.690]  You're on the big RT.
[01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:07.211]  Let's be clear.
[01:25:07.791 --> 01:25:11.615]  RT Global is in every cable system, basically, in Europe.
[01:25:11.715 --> 01:25:12.436]  It's in Asia.
[01:25:12.496 --> 01:25:14.338]  I mean, it's a big threat to CNN.
[01:25:19.065 --> 01:25:20.486]  Well, of course I want to come on your show.
[01:25:20.526 --> 01:25:22.027]  I never even asked, but... No, no.
[01:25:22.367 --> 01:25:24.128]  I was banned from RT America.
[01:25:24.148 --> 01:25:25.368]  I'm trying to be clear here, Max.
[01:25:25.689 --> 01:25:26.709]  Not RT Global.
[01:25:27.129 --> 01:25:28.650]  But RT Global never has me on.
[01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:29.691]  They have Watson on.
[01:25:29.751 --> 01:25:33.433]  Listen, I went from being on there twice a week to never on there.
[01:25:34.213 --> 01:25:34.893]  So it's not a rumor.
[01:25:35.974 --> 01:25:44.538]  I mean, you don't want me to tell the name of the reporters or of the... I mean... You know I can't say break confidence on that.
[01:25:44.939 --> 01:25:46.600]  I'm telling you that happened.
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:47.240]  Do you believe me?
[01:25:49.153 --> 01:25:52.718]  RT America is a subset of RT Global.
[01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:53.660]  I know.
[01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:55.803]  I don't really pay much attention to RT America.
[01:25:55.843 --> 01:25:59.448]  Well, it's very small comparatively, but that's what I'm saying to you.
[01:26:00.189 --> 01:26:01.330]  RT America.
[01:26:01.531 --> 01:26:03.253]  I am banned from RT America.
[01:26:03.594 --> 01:26:05.056]  They were having me on twice a week.
[01:26:06.522 --> 01:26:09.984]  Well, I'll extend my invitation right now.
[01:26:10.724 --> 01:26:11.585]  I'm with the Mothership.
[01:26:12.105 --> 01:26:14.906]  And you can come on anytime you want to, as I've always said.
[01:26:14.926 --> 01:26:16.587]  Whatever subject you want, brother, I'll come on.
[01:26:16.607 --> 01:26:20.249]  I come on your show, you come on my show.
[01:26:20.269 --> 01:26:22.750]  That's the way it's always been for six years, five years.
[01:26:23.550 --> 01:26:26.652]  By the way, this Wall lady, though, I mean, she is such a rat.
[01:26:27.572 --> 01:26:30.654]  And notice, she hasn't even gotten a job since they got her to do this.
[01:26:30.694 --> 01:26:31.854]  She looks so upset.
[01:26:32.074 --> 01:26:33.415]  Have you seen that whole testimony?
[01:26:35.689 --> 01:26:37.051]  Well, she's unemployed, isn't she?
[01:26:37.071 --> 01:26:40.235]  I mean, but eventually they found a weak link in the chain.
[01:26:40.315 --> 01:26:47.303]  Somebody to take money, ruin their career, flush their career down the toilet, and now she's scrambling.
[01:26:47.323 --> 01:26:54.472]  I know, these journalists like Armstrong Williams that people don't get, you sell out, you get caught, you've destroyed yourself.
[01:26:55.912 --> 01:27:00.514]  It's a real smack in the face to, you know, actual journalists who are dying out there doing real journalism.
[01:27:01.215 --> 01:27:05.097]  Michael Hastings, for example, who was killed by the Pentagon doing journalism.
[01:27:05.337 --> 01:27:11.340]  You know, in his memory, this Liz Wall, you know, sells out to propagandists.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:12.921]  It's sad.
[01:27:13.001 --> 01:27:13.801]  It's a sad day.
[01:27:13.821 --> 01:27:19.264]  I want to play a clip of Wall calling his cult members, ISIS, you name it.
[01:27:20.064 --> 01:27:20.484]  Here it is.
[01:27:24.315 --> 01:27:26.377]  Had a little bit of a glitch there with that computer.
[01:27:26.397 --> 01:27:27.878]  We'll play it here as soon as they're ready.
[01:27:28.699 --> 01:27:29.460]  Well, let's move on.
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:31.702]  You know, I mean, there's other stuff to talk about.
[01:27:31.722 --> 01:27:33.524]  No, but it is a big deal.
[01:27:33.624 --> 01:27:39.470]  I mean, it is a big deal that Congress is having hearings about shutting down blogs and comparing us to ISIS.
[01:27:40.103 --> 01:27:52.130]  It's huge and competitive, because RT doing actual journalism is making Fox and CNN and Rupert Murdoch look like the cheap propaganda idiots that they are, and they don't want to compete.
[01:27:52.150 --> 01:27:53.131]  They don't want to do their job.
[01:27:53.491 --> 01:27:55.972]  You know, America, this is their thing now.
[01:27:56.293 --> 01:27:57.934]  Instead of competing, they just bomb you.
[01:27:58.154 --> 01:28:03.237]  Instead of putting up journalists, they put up Ryan McWilliams, who lies through his teeth on NBC.
[01:28:04.317 --> 01:28:05.397]  They just don't want to compete.
[01:28:05.437 --> 01:28:05.997]  They're lazy.
[01:28:06.178 --> 01:28:12.739]  It's just a lazy group of no good... Have you heard now the new NBC head wants to bring Williams back?
[01:28:14.399 --> 01:28:22.201]  Well, he's a known entity of a guy who lies, so I guess that makes him qualified to be an NBC anchor.
[01:28:22.661 --> 01:28:30.323]  He's a liar, so people know that what he's saying is nonsense, and I guess as a tool for propaganda, that makes sense.
[01:28:32.284 --> 01:28:35.086]  Doesn't the establishment get that it's truth that has power?
[01:28:36.847 --> 01:28:38.227]  They are afraid, Alex.
[01:28:38.808 --> 01:28:40.088]  They are afraid.
[01:28:40.128 --> 01:28:51.575]  They are afraid that they can't keep this illusion alive forever, and that the edifice of nonsense is crumbling.
[01:28:51.675 --> 01:28:54.597]  And so they are desperate.
[01:28:55.177 --> 01:28:58.839]  And in so doing, they're losing power even more rapidly.
[01:28:59.668 --> 01:29:00.008]  I agree.
[01:29:00.048 --> 01:29:08.154]  Let's go to break now that our tricaster is working with just a short clip of this Benedict Arnold reporter demonizing blogs.
[01:29:08.174 --> 01:29:08.514]  Here it is.
[01:29:09.079 --> 01:29:21.246]  And why it's effective, I think you had mentioned that it provides this voice for fringe voices, extremists, and it works because it provides a place for these people.
[01:29:21.686 --> 01:29:26.889]  A place where these people can congregate and feed off of each other's biases.
[01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:30.972]  It's almost like a community that is almost like a cult.
[01:29:31.252 --> 01:29:31.693]  I would say.
[01:29:31.713 --> 01:29:33.054]  That's right, worldwide, you don't want tyranny.
[01:29:33.074 --> 01:29:42.126]  That is formed online and they mobilize and they feel like they are part of some enlightened fight against the establishment.
[01:29:42.146 --> 01:29:42.606]  We are, Chum.
[01:29:42.706 --> 01:29:43.768]  And they find a home.
[01:29:46.451 --> 01:29:49.394]  They find a place where they're heard and they find a sense of belonging.
[01:29:49.414 --> 01:29:51.616]  We're going to come back where she describes us as ISIS.
[01:29:51.876 --> 01:29:52.817]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[01:29:52.857 --> 01:29:53.558]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:53.578 --> 01:29:54.659]  We are Real Journalism.
[01:29:55.179 --> 01:29:57.261]  It's all about human liberty, all about human empowerment.
[01:29:57.281 --> 01:29:58.202]  It's all about telling the truth.
[01:29:58.422 --> 01:29:59.163]  We're the cult of truth.
[01:29:59.183 --> 01:29:59.923]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.064 --> 01:30:01.405]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:01.425 --> 01:30:02.186]  The cult of truth.
[01:30:02.926 --> 01:30:03.947]  The cult of justice.
[01:30:03.967 --> 01:30:05.368]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:05.409 --> 01:30:06.189]  The cult of freedom.
[01:30:06.970 --> 01:30:08.151]  Yeah, it's true.
[01:30:08.191 --> 01:30:08.912]  George Washington.
[01:30:09.801 --> 01:30:14.963]  Pre-crime technology is on the rise, and the latest city to adopt this philosophy is Miami, Florida.
[01:30:15.143 --> 01:30:24.686]  The Miami PD is in the process of planning and adopting HunchLab, a predictive policing system that will be able to produce small maps of where specific crimes occur in the city during a particular shift.
[01:30:24.926 --> 01:30:30.007]  Miami's HunchLab system will use everything from paydays to school calendars, weather reports, and social media.
[01:30:30.168 --> 01:30:34.709]  This is unlike the crimestat-only PredPol systems, which are in use in LA and Atlanta,
[01:30:34.989 --> 01:30:42.014]  And as we covered in 2013, Seattle and Tacoma, did you know Google and the CIA have been working on political pre-crime technology since 2010?
[01:30:42.074 --> 01:30:52.803]  They are funding a company, Recorded Future, which scans tens of thousands of websites, blogs, and Twitter accounts to find inputted relationships between people, organizations, actions, and incidents.
[01:30:53.063 --> 01:31:00.849]  In fact, in 2010, Google and In-Q-Tel injected $10 million into Recorded Future, eight years after the movie Minority Report was released.
[01:31:01.169 --> 01:31:05.951]  Predictive programming was already in place for us to accept pre-crime technology and the results it produces.
[01:31:06.151 --> 01:31:09.132]  Rob Dew for Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:09.532 --> 01:31:10.412]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:31:10.452 --> 01:31:10.872]  Good, brother.
[01:31:11.032 --> 01:31:12.713]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:31:12.753 --> 01:31:14.574]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:31:14.694 --> 01:31:18.535]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives.
[01:31:18.595 --> 01:31:21.296]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:31:21.336 --> 01:31:23.596]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:31:23.756 --> 01:31:31.678]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:31:32.038 --> 01:31:35.058]  We do the Super Male and the Super Female Vitality.
[01:31:35.178 --> 01:31:36.679]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:31:36.719 --> 01:31:41.119]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[01:31:41.399 --> 01:31:43.840]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:44.981]  We're good to go.
[01:32:09.398 --> 01:32:14.399]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:32:14.539 --> 01:32:20.421]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:32:20.661 --> 01:32:25.242]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:32:25.442 --> 01:32:28.763]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:32:29.003 --> 01:32:30.583]  No needles, no injections.
[01:32:30.983 --> 01:32:36.104]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:39.285 --> 01:32:39.885]  Alex Jones here.
[01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:49.348]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:32:49.588 --> 01:32:53.069]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:32:53.389 --> 01:33:01.371]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[01:33:04.032 --> 01:33:05.112]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:31.650 --> 01:33:36.266]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:36.306 --> 01:33:37.670]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:42.611 --> 01:33:53.463]  I think you had mentioned that it provides this voice for fringe voices, extremists, and it works because it provides a place for these people.
[01:33:53.923 --> 01:33:59.929]  A place where these people can congregate and feed off of each other's biases.
[01:34:00.009 --> 01:34:03.193]  It's almost like a community that is almost like a cult.
[01:34:03.473 --> 01:34:04.033]  I would say.
[01:34:04.593 --> 01:34:18.418]  That is formed online and they mobilize and they they feel like they're part of some enlightened fight against the establishment that they and they they find a home.
[01:34:18.678 --> 01:34:22.900]  They find a place where they're heard and they find a sense of belonging.
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:29.622]  They find an outlet where they can where they can a platform to voice their deranged views.
[01:34:31.232 --> 01:34:32.473]  And there's like an hour of it.
[01:34:32.714 --> 01:34:34.195]  She goes on to say we're like ISIS.
[01:34:34.576 --> 01:34:35.657]  The congressman agrees.
[01:34:36.138 --> 01:34:43.207]  If you want to see the whole video at InfoWars.com, the headline is, Bloggers compared to ISIS in congressional hearing.
[01:34:43.868 --> 01:34:45.930]  InfoWars.com from about two weeks ago.
[01:34:47.649 --> 01:34:49.490]  And Max Keiser is our guest.
[01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:50.991]  I've got a bunch of Twitter questions for him.
[01:34:51.011 --> 01:34:52.011]  I want to get into silver.
[01:34:52.411 --> 01:34:54.472]  I want to get into the economy, the state of the world.
[01:34:55.393 --> 01:34:57.974]  There's the headline, bloggers prepared to isis during a congressional hearing.
[01:34:59.035 --> 01:35:05.358]  Chairman Royce questions witnesses at hearing on confronting Russia's weaponization of information.
[01:35:05.378 --> 01:35:12.101]  I mean, the Pentagon calls it info war, and the Pentagon admits they're engaged in deception domestically.
[01:35:13.191 --> 01:35:17.272]  It's a PSYOP when the veterans don't get health care and are put on no treat list.
[01:35:17.892 --> 01:35:19.532]  Then they spin it as if it's a mistake.
[01:35:19.812 --> 01:35:21.012]  It's not a mistake, it's by design.
[01:35:21.512 --> 01:35:26.553]  We're going back to Max Keiser here in just a moment to get his final take on this, but it's a big deal.
[01:35:28.054 --> 01:35:33.234]  That Max Keiser, who's worked at the BBC, Al Jazeera, U.S.
[01:35:33.314 --> 01:35:41.796]  News Publications, you name it, he's an accredited journalist, filmmaker, former top stockbroker,
[01:35:43.570 --> 01:35:52.292]  Just came out, he's been on Nightline, you name it, and just said that they approached him to do the same thing.
[01:35:53.312 --> 01:35:54.293]  That's huge.
[01:35:55.633 --> 01:35:56.753]  We could tell it was staged.
[01:35:58.394 --> 01:36:00.974]  But it is just simply amazing.
[01:36:01.975 --> 01:36:06.856]  You notice media came out and said it was obviously staged and she didn't really challenge that because she knows in court it would come out.
[01:36:08.410 --> 01:36:09.351]  Wow, just amazing.
[01:36:09.391 --> 01:36:11.893]  Before we go any further, we are self-funded.
[01:36:11.913 --> 01:36:12.934]  We're not state-funded.
[01:36:12.954 --> 01:36:13.855]  We're not state-directed.
[01:36:13.895 --> 01:36:14.856]  We are liberty-directed.
[01:36:14.876 --> 01:36:18.159]  I get down on my hands and knees every day and pray for discernment.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:23.143]  So I pray to be directed by the Spirit of Christ.
[01:36:24.585 --> 01:36:25.726]  That's politically incorrect, isn't it?
[01:36:26.546 --> 01:36:28.128]  So please fund our operation.
[01:36:28.148 --> 01:36:34.193]  To do that, we have high-quality water filtration systems that cut off the fluoride and glyphosates and hundreds of other things.
[01:36:34.233 --> 01:36:34.554]  We have
[01:36:35.716 --> 01:36:44.734]  Just hundreds of great Patriot, Libertarian t-shirt and ball cap designs, sweatshirts, camo, Molon Labe, info or store.com.
[01:36:47.048 --> 01:36:56.336]  And we have a countdown on Infowarslife.com on three different sales we're doing that end in two days, 12 hours, 23 minutes, 15 seconds.
[01:36:57.176 --> 01:37:11.008]  And that is buy two bottles of X2 nascent iodine, the highest quality out there, it's basically a detoxer, and get fluoride shield absolutely free that has four other ingredients in it that detox you.
[01:37:11.308 --> 01:37:13.230]  That's a huge value and free shipping.
[01:37:15.216 --> 01:37:16.417]  So that's an amazing deal.
[01:37:16.557 --> 01:37:17.958]  And we've got something that even tops that.
[01:37:18.078 --> 01:37:19.699]  Two bottles of colloidal silver.
[01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:22.241]  Highest quality, 30 parts per million.
[01:37:22.541 --> 01:37:25.823]  Colloidal silver, anything higher than that is toxic from our research.
[01:37:25.843 --> 01:37:26.543]  That's why we don't have it.
[01:37:26.724 --> 01:37:28.585]  People go, we have 100, we have 200 billion parts.
[01:37:28.905 --> 01:37:30.086]  Whatever.
[01:37:30.106 --> 01:37:33.088]  30 parts per million has been found to be the best from the research out there.
[01:37:33.748 --> 01:37:35.389]  And it's $14.95 a bottle.
[01:37:35.429 --> 01:37:36.930]  You can get two bottles of it.
[01:37:37.611 --> 01:37:40.393]  Get free shipping and a free bottle of fluoride shield.
[01:37:40.653 --> 01:37:42.294]  That ends in two and a half days.
[01:37:44.212 --> 01:37:45.072]  Two and a half days.
[01:37:49.074 --> 01:37:50.515]  It's over, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:52.896 --> 01:37:54.597]  Two and a half days, that deal is over.
[01:37:55.197 --> 01:38:03.081]  Two bottles, 50% off, free shipping, and you get a free bottle of Fluoride Show.
[01:38:03.101 --> 01:38:05.242]  We've never offered anything this good.
[01:38:05.362 --> 01:38:07.203]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:38:07.263 --> 01:38:09.064]  And finally, we have another deal we're running.
[01:38:14.048 --> 01:38:23.988]  That's the Alex Challenge Pack, that's the time-release oxygen to flush out your guts, the high-quality Survival Shield X2, Deep Earth, Nation Iodine.
[01:38:25.273 --> 01:38:34.176]  And then, of course, on top of that, the super male vitality natural herbs to boost your body's virility if you're a man were sold out of the super female vitality.
[01:38:34.456 --> 01:38:39.158]  You can see the side-by-side photos and more at infowareslife.com or infowarestore.com.
[01:38:39.738 --> 01:38:42.139]  Now, our guest website is maxkaiser.com.
[01:38:42.219 --> 01:38:46.860]  You can also follow him on Twitter by linking through there as well.
[01:38:47.741 --> 01:38:47.941]  Max,
[01:38:49.065 --> 01:38:53.329]  I want to go to calls and I want to get into some Twitter questions here in about 10 minutes.
[01:38:53.369 --> 01:38:56.812]  Hopefully you can stay a little bit in the next hour with us so we have time to get to all the calls.
[01:38:57.292 --> 01:39:03.577]  But regardless, you want to put bookends on controlled media in this country versus independent media?
[01:39:04.398 --> 01:39:13.463]  And then I want to get into the economy and other issues with you, but what is the dinosaur corporate globalist media going to do as it begins to collapse?
[01:39:13.844 --> 01:39:16.925]  They seem to be panicking now, calling for censorship.
[01:39:17.266 --> 01:39:19.267]  Won't that only discredit them more?
[01:39:19.987 --> 01:39:22.669]  How do you expect the empire to strike back, Max Keiser?
[01:39:23.666 --> 01:39:39.035]  Well, the tip of the spear for the Empire to strike back in this instance would be the MPAA, the Motion Picture Association of America, who wants to kill the Internet by turning it into HBO or Showtime.
[01:39:39.596 --> 01:39:44.439]  That if you want Internet that's not deathly slow, you're gonna pay for it.
[01:39:45.059 --> 01:39:51.723]  And once this happens and they balkanize the Internet, and it's no longer end-to-end, peer-to-peer, anyone can communicate with anyone anywhere in the world,
[01:39:52.798 --> 01:40:05.303]  It becomes the death of the Internet and they therefore are going to eliminate the possibility of the Arab Spring or even in Baltimore now they're saying that the problem is that people use social media to communicate.
[01:40:05.543 --> 01:40:06.863]  They're vilifying social media.
[01:40:06.983 --> 01:40:15.727]  They're vilifying the ability to communicate and it's the MPAA and the MPAA was the number one instigator behind Aaron Swartz's death.
[01:40:15.787 --> 01:40:18.748]  His father at the funeral said Aaron Swartz was killed
[01:40:19.228 --> 01:40:22.410]  By Chris Dodd, who runs the MPAA.
[01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:40.599]  The MPAA staged the attack on Kim Dotcom in New Zealand, a jurisdiction that's nowhere near Los Angeles, California, and yet they organized a SWAT team to invade his home, arrest him, bring him down into court, trying to seek extradition for a guy who's never been in the United States, never done business in the United States.
[01:40:40.779 --> 01:40:42.020]  Again, that's the MPAA.
[01:40:42.782 --> 01:40:52.414]  So the MPAA, which of course is Hollywood, and Hollywood has the best propaganda machine in the world, people spend billions of dollars every weekend supporting their cartel of copyright.
[01:40:53.241 --> 01:41:05.929]  Uh, that's how, and they, Hillary Clinton, huge supporter of the MPAA, same thing with Barack Obama, and I, I, I predict that when Barack Obama leaves his office as president, he'll, he will assume the mantle of leading the MPAA.
[01:41:05.989 --> 01:41:07.330]  He'll take over from Chris Dodd.
[01:41:07.490 --> 01:41:11.372]  He'll be living in Los Angeles, and he'll be lobbying for the copyright cartel.
[01:41:11.412 --> 01:41:12.733]  So he'll be the king of the internet.
[01:41:12.813 --> 01:41:14.294]  He'll be the king of the control of the internet.
[01:41:14.334 --> 01:41:22.777]  And of course, as you know, they've leaked in the Pacific Trade Partnership that one section that, just as you say, is SOPA and CISPA on PCP and steroids.
[01:41:23.357 --> 01:41:27.519]  It says, no judge, no jury, any big company wants to shut you down.
[01:41:28.019 --> 01:41:31.661]  They're claiming that they're going to copyright words where we can't even say them.
[01:41:32.101 --> 01:41:35.403]  They're saying they're going to copyright you not being able to put oil in your car.
[01:41:35.763 --> 01:41:39.744]  They're using copyright to basically copyright oxygen.
[01:41:41.545 --> 01:41:51.208]  They're copyrighting our own genes, saying you can't... I've copyrighted intellectual property to the point where if you use the word Microsoft in an email, then at the end of the month you're going to get a bill from Microsoft.
[01:41:51.228 --> 01:41:52.608]  And by the way, they said that, Max.
[01:41:52.628 --> 01:41:53.668]  You're not exaggerating.
[01:41:54.429 --> 01:41:56.609]  I've been saying that for years, on your show.
[01:41:57.029 --> 01:41:59.490]  But now with the technology and with the ability to
[01:42:00.208 --> 01:42:01.289]  Thank you very much.
[01:42:18.027 --> 01:42:20.608]  I don't want to kiss your butt, but on my show, seven years ago,
[01:42:36.556 --> 01:42:38.496]  That was about eight years ago, you first started coming on.
[01:42:38.857 --> 01:42:51.399]  You called it the casino gulag economy, and you said, Alex, people will be debtor prisons, and by law, they'll have to play video games all day, that then pay them money.
[01:42:51.439 --> 01:42:53.380]  They got to go out and advertise on other sites.
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:55.860]  Now in the last year, that's everywhere.
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:42:58.921]  Now that's the new job, and they have prisoners.
[01:42:58.941 --> 01:43:04.262]  I saw an article last month, maybe we can pull it up, I forget where it was, where prisoners are forced to play video games.
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:08.163]  Yeah, to make virtual... How did you know that?
[01:43:08.203 --> 01:43:09.004]  How did you know that?
[01:43:09.925 --> 01:43:17.753]  Because I created something called the Hollywood Stock Exchange, which went up against the MPAA in 1996 with my virtual specialist technology.
[01:43:18.154 --> 01:43:19.935]  They then took over the board of directors.
[01:43:20.336 --> 01:43:27.043]  They confiscated $40 million from shareholders led by my co-founder, the guy who now runs Liongate Film.
[01:43:27.837 --> 01:43:35.322]  And they made it clear that you cannot, and then they outlawed, box office futures contract under Chris Dodd in 2010.
[01:43:35.402 --> 01:43:45.268]  So Hollywood is the only industry in the world, in America I should say, where it's protected that you cannot trade a derivative contract, a futures contract, based on box office.
[01:43:45.529 --> 01:43:55.435]  Because they know that every other industry, agriculture or industrial, once you introduce financialization and futures contracts, you are then giving that industry way to Wall Street.
[01:43:56.061 --> 01:44:00.264]  But Hollywood lobbied under Chris Dodd, who's now running the MPAA.
[01:44:00.585 --> 01:44:08.731]  As a senator, Dodd, he made sure that box office futures were outlawed in 2010 and the quid pro quo was he was made head of the MPAA.
[01:44:08.771 --> 01:44:13.335]  So I had a ringside seat into the ugliness of what the copyright cartel was doing.
[01:44:13.975 --> 01:44:15.616]  And that's how I knew what was going on.
[01:44:15.736 --> 01:44:23.241]  But here's the latest development in the past six months to force you to go online and gamble your life away and live in the casino gulag.
[01:44:23.281 --> 01:44:25.002]  And it's the introduction of negative interest rates.
[01:44:25.042 --> 01:44:26.863]  Something I said on your show three years ago happened.
[01:44:27.283 --> 01:44:27.944]  Everyone laughed.
[01:44:28.004 --> 01:44:29.625]  I said, you can't introduce negative interest rates.
[01:44:29.665 --> 01:44:30.085]  You did.
[01:44:30.125 --> 01:44:31.546]  And then now Sweden has it.
[01:44:32.206 --> 01:44:32.687]  Exactly!
[01:44:33.187 --> 01:44:35.929]  Now, they started it first last year.
[01:44:36.269 --> 01:44:37.150]  Switzerland has it.
[01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:38.211]  It's now spreading.
[01:44:38.451 --> 01:44:43.535]  And now they're talking about doing it here, Max, and charging us to use cash or banning it.
[01:44:43.575 --> 01:44:44.776]  The head of Citi has said it.
[01:44:45.176 --> 01:44:46.577]  The head of JPMorgan has said it.
[01:44:46.897 --> 01:44:48.278]  The war on cash is on.
[01:44:48.539 --> 01:44:53.342]  And then why are they hoarding at JPMorgan 50 million ounces of silver?
[01:44:54.903 --> 01:44:56.905]  I will tell you why, and that's a brilliant segue.
[01:44:56.985 --> 01:44:57.986]  You're absolutely correct.
[01:44:58.386 --> 01:44:59.547]  These things are related.
[01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:03.311]  Back in 1933, FDR confiscated gold.
[01:45:03.871 --> 01:45:05.272]  If you recall, you read your history books.
[01:45:05.832 --> 01:45:15.696]  After all the gold was confiscated, they priced the dollar down against gold by 60% in an attempt to create inflation, to get out of the Depression.
[01:45:16.756 --> 01:45:21.778]  In the year 2015, it's not practical to go door-to-door to confiscate gold or silver.
[01:45:22.418 --> 01:45:28.581]  So they used paper futures contracts leveraged at $1,000 to $1,000 to drive the price down to give J.P.
[01:45:28.621 --> 01:45:28.941]  Morgan
[01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:38.417]  And other banks around the world, the opportunity to buy gold and silver at these ridiculously low, cheap prices until they take total control of these prices.
[01:45:38.837 --> 01:45:41.860]  And then in six months or so, they'll come out and say, you know what?
[01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:43.041]  It's the new world order.
[01:45:43.401 --> 01:45:44.622]  We need a new currency grid.
[01:45:44.782 --> 01:45:45.883]  We need a new Bretton Woods.
[01:45:46.163 --> 01:45:48.846]  We need a new way to trade these currencies around the world.
[01:45:48.926 --> 01:45:49.406]  And guess what?
[01:45:49.426 --> 01:45:52.749]  They're all going to be based against or valued against gold.
[01:45:53.408 --> 01:45:57.009]  Except not gold at $1,200 an ounce, gold at $7,000 an ounce.
[01:45:57.089 --> 01:46:04.030]  And is that why all the elites and universities are hoarding billions of dollars of it while using paper naked shorting to drive down the price?
[01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:06.170]  Well, yes, exactly.
[01:46:06.230 --> 01:46:10.691]  But more importantly, that's why China and Russia are hoarding gold.
[01:46:10.791 --> 01:46:14.292]  Russia has just bought another million ounces last month.
[01:46:14.592 --> 01:46:20.633]  China will come out, and my understanding is China this year will finally disclose for the first time in
[01:46:21.405 --> 01:46:21.927]  We're good to go.
[01:46:28.559 --> 01:46:29.480]  Tons of gold.
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:38.067]  The actual number that's coming to be revealed later this year when all this goes down is that China will own more than America's position of 8,000 tons.
[01:46:38.628 --> 01:46:54.402]  Therefore, China will have the de facto strongest position in the new currency grid to be introduced, which makes sense because they have the world's biggest economy, and they have the world's biggest military, and Apple Computer sells apples in China, and China's going to take it over.
[01:46:54.662 --> 01:47:11.016]  Larry Summers wrote last month that it was basically the day America blinked, and that it was basically the end of our hegemon, that we went along with the Chinese investment bank that's got all these countries joining it, but a lot of the same insiders are investing in it.
[01:47:11.616 --> 01:47:12.757]  Is that just rhetoric?
[01:47:12.797 --> 01:47:20.043]  Because his answer was, if we sell out faster to global governance, then we can compete with the Chinese.
[01:47:20.464 --> 01:47:22.846]  What do you think Summers really meant by all that?
[01:47:23.339 --> 01:47:30.482]  Barry Summers is a real charlatan, and he plays both sides of the fence brilliantly, and he's a survivor.
[01:47:31.022 --> 01:47:34.784]  But he speaks with pork tongue almost every single time.
[01:47:34.844 --> 01:47:35.945]  He's a duplicitous king.
[01:47:36.605 --> 01:47:42.668]  But what's happening is that China and Russia have started their own bank to compete with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
[01:47:43.777 --> 01:47:44.218]  We're good to go.
[01:47:59.279 --> 01:47:59.479]  Sure.
[01:48:29.646 --> 01:48:32.548]  And playing casino games for cash and these things have come true.
[01:48:32.588 --> 01:48:36.970]  So I want to reiterate that these predictions we've made are coming true.
[01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:43.833]  Remember, conspiracy theory is the term that the cabal uses to discredit investigative journalism.
[01:48:44.895 --> 01:48:46.797]  Well, that was declassified in the 60s.
[01:48:46.837 --> 01:48:51.341]  The CIA coined the term and directed major news organizations to use it.
[01:48:51.601 --> 01:48:55.424]  Then in 1993, the Clinton Library just released this four months ago.
[01:48:55.904 --> 01:48:57.065]  We had Joseph Farah on.
[01:48:57.506 --> 01:49:00.569]  Some of it's so incendiary, Farah hasn't even released it yet.
[01:49:00.609 --> 01:49:02.670]  It's so damning and so destructive.
[01:49:02.951 --> 01:49:05.393]  But they're working with lawyers right now.
[01:49:05.853 --> 01:49:06.774]  But it was how to block
[01:49:07.034 --> 01:49:10.977]  The independent media being born, how to buy it off, how to shut it down.
[01:49:11.117 --> 01:49:17.923]  They were fearing it then, and they said, we must go back to the CIA plan to call them conspiracy theorists.
[01:49:18.263 --> 01:49:20.585]  We must not allow the people to ever have a choice.
[01:49:21.066 --> 01:49:22.967]  I mean, those memos are sickening.
[01:49:23.007 --> 01:49:23.688]  Have you read those?
[01:49:24.388 --> 01:49:24.568]  No.
[01:49:25.089 --> 01:49:26.810]  No, but I haven't seen it.
[01:49:26.850 --> 01:49:32.055]  But anytime anyone hears the word conspiracy theory, know that it's code for investigative journalism.
[01:49:33.476 --> 01:49:34.737]  Or questioning known liars.
[01:49:35.839 --> 01:49:42.443]  Yeah, it's just anything that's investigative journalism in American media is referred to as a conspiracy theory.
[01:49:42.463 --> 01:49:43.223]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:49:43.263 --> 01:49:50.547]  Why do you think AP reporters and others were targeted and attacked by police in Baltimore, but then they were ordered to stand down with the looters?
[01:49:50.627 --> 01:49:51.488]  What is the plan there?
[01:49:52.928 --> 01:49:55.150]  Well, AP, what was exactly the story?
[01:49:55.190 --> 01:49:55.790]  Repeat that again.
[01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:58.811]  Well, they just attack our reporters, other reporters all over.
[01:49:59.192 --> 01:50:01.233]  They won't stop the looters, but they attack reporters.
[01:50:03.175 --> 01:50:06.117]  Well, that's a trend that's been happening for a while now.
[01:50:06.177 --> 01:50:10.100]  They are making filming police a criminal offense.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:12.582]  They don't want any record of any of the transgressions.
[01:50:12.982 --> 01:50:16.885]  The violence in the police departments across the country are escalating quite rapidly.
[01:50:17.726 --> 01:50:20.808]  And, as you know, they've become militarized in the U.S.
[01:50:21.349 --> 01:50:26.132]  So, journalism is there to record this, and so they've got to get rid of that.
[01:50:26.152 --> 01:50:26.973]  They don't want any record.
[01:50:27.573 --> 01:50:32.954]  Of the police acting as a military force for the kleptocrats, do they?
[01:50:34.135 --> 01:50:39.456]  Yeah, but there are some problems with the police, Max, but from the numbers I've seen, police violence is flat.
[01:50:39.516 --> 01:50:40.496]  Doesn't mean it's not horrible.
[01:50:41.276 --> 01:50:46.597]  But, why will they not stop the looters, but they'll attack reporters, is what I'm saying.
[01:50:47.077 --> 01:50:49.578]  I mean, have you seen the clip of the mayor saying, we let them riot?
[01:50:51.187 --> 01:50:56.690]  I'm learning all that from your show today, because I don't really follow too closely some of the stuff in the U.S.
[01:50:56.730 --> 01:50:58.490]  No, I know you're mainly following geopolitical.
[01:50:58.811 --> 01:51:05.053]  I want to ask you where the global economy is going in your view when we come back, and I want to get to Twitter questions and talk to Scott, Adam, and John, and others.
[01:51:05.073 --> 01:51:08.335]  And we're going to ask Max if he wants to stay 20 minutes to the next hour to take your calls.
[01:51:10.083 --> 01:51:12.187]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[01:51:12.427 --> 01:51:16.954]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[01:51:25.154 --> 01:51:29.220]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:29.261 --> 01:51:32.265]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:32.446 --> 01:51:33.788]  Does that sound right to you?

[01:51:42.139 --> 01:51:45.481]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:45.601 --> 01:51:47.162]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[01:51:47.262 --> 01:51:49.023]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:49.223 --> 01:51:54.706]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:55.066 --> 01:51:55.806]  I know, right?
[01:51:55.886 --> 01:51:56.807]  You love it, too!
[01:51:57.207 --> 01:51:58.508]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.

[01:52:10.074 --> 01:52:12.924]  Why use dial-up when you can use broadband?
[01:52:13.686 --> 01:52:14.710]  Why travel with this?
[01:52:15.757 --> 01:52:16.778]  When you can use this.
[01:52:17.598 --> 01:52:23.160]  And why would anyone use colloidal or ionic silver when you can use supernatural silver?
[01:52:23.581 --> 01:52:30.364]  Supernatural silver is state-of-the-art and it's been clinically proven to be several hundred times more effective than those other silvers.
[01:52:30.804 --> 01:52:36.366]  It's powerful enough to protect you and your family from the threat of deadly viruses, bacteria and fungus.
[01:52:36.746 --> 01:52:39.988]  But it's so safe that it can be used internally or topically.

[01:54:13.171 --> 01:54:15.353]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:15.693 --> 01:54:16.513]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:54:16.714 --> 01:54:18.675]  We're here weekdays, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[01:54:18.735 --> 01:54:19.295]  Eastern.
[01:54:19.716 --> 01:54:24.159]  Back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:54:24.939 --> 01:54:26.921]  Does InfoWars have a corner on the truth?
[01:54:26.941 --> 01:54:26.981]  No.
[01:54:27.061 --> 01:54:28.662]  Does RT?
[01:54:28.722 --> 01:54:28.982]  No.
[01:54:29.022 --> 01:54:29.803]  Does ABC News?
[01:54:29.883 --> 01:54:30.123]  No.
[01:54:31.644 --> 01:54:33.446]  There are some good reporters at CBS News.
[01:54:33.726 --> 01:54:34.987]  They get fired when they tell the truth.
[01:54:35.067 --> 01:54:39.250]  But big global institutions themselves
[01:54:40.703 --> 01:54:45.191]  ...have a very clear agenda for planetary domination that's taking place.
[01:54:45.652 --> 01:54:48.496]  And individual freedom is not in the equation, it's being targeted.
[01:54:48.937 --> 01:54:52.463]  Max Keiser has agreed to stay with us to take calls and take Twitter questions.
[01:54:52.483 --> 01:54:54.246]  20 minutes into the next hour...
[01:54:55.981 --> 01:55:00.284]  There's a very powerful article at Zero Hedge today that we've posted at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:00.744 --> 01:55:06.948]  The Baltimore riots, the stunning comments by Oriol's owner's son, who is the vice president.
[01:55:07.308 --> 01:55:12.231]  I want to read these later after Max has left us, but it really breaks it all down.
[01:55:13.092 --> 01:55:13.993]  Have you just joined us?
[01:55:14.373 --> 01:55:15.774]  Again, Max Keiser is our guest.
[01:55:15.814 --> 01:55:17.355]  MaxKeiser.com is his site.
[01:55:17.735 --> 01:55:20.677]  You can follow him by linking through on his Twitter there as well.
[01:55:21.517 --> 01:55:41.229]  Max, I want to go ahead and go to Scott, Adam, Dan, John, and others as we get ready to end this hour, at least get one call in, but we live in this fantasy land where every economic indicator shows the world's going into depression, but they tell us it's a boom town, but then a month ago all the economic numbers came out and said we're in trouble.
[01:55:41.872 --> 01:55:44.113]  But then they had new numbers that came out that said everything's great.
[01:55:44.533 --> 01:55:50.175]  What is the real economic status of the planet, and how fast are we drifting into depression?
[01:55:51.855 --> 01:56:01.138]  Well, the way that the economy is measured from the people who say it's doing great, they look at the price of stock, and they look at the price of houses.
[01:56:02.539 --> 01:56:06.300]  And these things are trading up, and they're at record highs.
[01:56:08.881 --> 01:56:09.521]  Why is that?
[01:56:09.581 --> 01:56:10.181]  It's because
[01:56:10.925 --> 01:56:26.770]  The central banks around the world, in an attempt to stimulate growth, starting six or seven years ago, embarked on a radical program of zero percent interest rates to try to create inflation.
[01:56:27.471 --> 01:56:37.054]  And by inflation, we're talking about some wage inflation, to get people's wages so that they were making more than the price of groceries and petrol, etc.
[01:56:37.694 --> 01:56:40.115]  But what's happened over these six or seven years is that the people
[01:56:40.888 --> 01:56:46.214]  Whose wages were hopefully going to start to go up, they never went up.
[01:56:46.294 --> 01:56:48.236]  In fact, wages have been going down.
[01:56:48.917 --> 01:56:54.442]  But all that money that they printed to try to get that to happen went somewhere.
[01:56:54.783 --> 01:56:55.403]  Where did it go?
[01:56:55.423 --> 01:57:03.452]  It went into the pockets of the very, very top who used it to buy stocks and property.
[01:57:04.367 --> 01:57:09.208]  And so the failure of mainstream media is to look at both sides of the coin.
[01:57:09.268 --> 01:57:26.933]  Because typically if you watch certainly financial media like CNBC, they'll just all day long, they'll say stocks are record high, that's great, and if you haven't doubled your net worth in the last six months, like the top 1,000 richest people in the UK did in the last six years, then it's because you're not working hard enough.
[01:57:26.973 --> 01:57:27.833]  It's because you're a loser.
[01:57:28.554 --> 01:57:29.274]  But that's not true.
[01:57:30.607 --> 01:57:41.811]  The reality is that the central banks have re-engineered the global economy in such a way where the money that they print never goes into increasing wages because they don't need people.
[01:57:42.491 --> 01:57:56.316]  Fundamentally, this is a shift that's happened in the last 20-25 years is that the idea of paying down debt in a country like America from the tax revenue from workers making money and making more money and increased wages has become obsolete.
[01:57:56.963 --> 01:58:03.529]  The wealth is no longer generated by people who own productive companies.
[01:58:03.649 --> 01:58:07.833]  It's generated through counterfeit derivatives, fraud, and other subsets.
[01:58:08.394 --> 01:58:11.016]  And now the elite believe they're going to have robots to service them.
[01:58:11.376 --> 01:58:12.678]  So why are humans even needed?
[01:58:12.698 --> 01:58:13.779]  They are truly delusional.
[01:58:14.179 --> 01:58:21.225]  Even though the London Guardian had a report on something we talked about a decade ago, how they're building command bases and armored redoubts in New Zealand.
[01:58:21.846 --> 01:58:27.947]  So the elite, like you called them, suicide bankers, are destroying the world so they can sit on the ash heap.
[01:58:28.308 --> 01:58:32.969]  We're gonna go to break with Max Keiser and come back and go right to Scott, Adam, Dan, John, and others.
[01:58:33.529 --> 01:58:36.889]  We're talking to first-time callers with specific questions for Max Keiser.
[01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:40.430]  Scott, then John, then Adam, then Dan, and others.
[01:58:40.890 --> 01:58:41.771]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:42.211 --> 01:58:45.852]  The system does not like you hearing this radio show for a good reason.
[01:58:46.192 --> 01:58:47.352]  Please spread the word.
[01:58:50.287 --> 01:58:52.070]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:53.552 --> 01:58:55.736]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:00.123 --> 01:59:01.344]  Another major health threat.
[01:59:01.384 --> 01:59:06.266]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:59:06.366 --> 01:59:08.987]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:59:09.027 --> 01:59:15.809]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:59:16.070 --> 01:59:18.931]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:59:19.071 --> 01:59:22.012]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:59:22.092 --> 01:59:24.013]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:59:24.033 --> 01:59:26.854]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:59:26.954 --> 01:59:32.476]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:59:32.676 --> 01:59:36.177]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:59:36.197 --> 01:59:39.158]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:59:39.278 --> 01:59:46.380]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:49.641]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[01:59:56.263 --> 01:59:56.703]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:59:56.723 --> 01:59:58.184]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:15.683 --> 02:00:16.324]  Big Brother.
[02:00:16.984 --> 02:00:18.005]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:18.746 --> 02:00:19.847]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:20.507 --> 02:00:21.328]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.089 --> 02:00:23.010]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.630 --> 02:00:27.253]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.834 --> 02:00:31.937]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.998 --> 02:00:35.581]  We're now into hour number three.
[02:00:35.661 --> 02:00:37.602]  Max Keiser's loose for another 20 minutes.
[02:00:37.643 --> 02:00:37.883]  Then,
[02:00:39.491 --> 02:00:46.076]  The incredible audio and video of an AARP ad with subliminal martial law announcements.
[02:00:47.537 --> 02:00:51.219]  Will you guys pull a couple of the other latest subliminal stuff we've covered?
[02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:54.602]  The last few months, usually attacking InfoWars.
[02:00:54.662 --> 02:00:55.743]  I mean, it's getting crazy.
[02:00:56.763 --> 02:00:57.764]  So that's coming up.
[02:00:58.064 --> 02:01:01.186]  Let's go to calls for Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[02:01:01.887 --> 02:01:04.529]  Scott in Washington, thanks for holding your on the air.
[02:01:06.041 --> 02:01:07.822]  Thanks for putting me on first, Alex.
[02:01:08.002 --> 02:01:15.165]  I'm going to say hi to Max Keiser because I really appreciate his grasp on the economy.
[02:01:15.245 --> 02:01:26.870]  But my question for Max is, stepping outside of the systems of monetary policy all over the globe, we have monetary policy in governments.
[02:01:27.737 --> 02:01:39.861]  That are oppressing us, they're enslaving us because they have the control of issuance of credit and currency that you still play with as a capitalist.
[02:01:40.242 --> 02:01:49.365]  Now first I have to say, being a capitalist using currency issued at interest is one of the worst representations of a capitalist in my opinion.
[02:01:50.539 --> 02:02:00.569]  I have a question of how do you suggest we step outside of these systems that divide us using currency?
[02:02:00.649 --> 02:02:01.370]  I know what he's going to say.
[02:02:01.390 --> 02:02:05.153]  He's going to say use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but I think it goes further.
[02:02:05.434 --> 02:02:09.378]  Having a garden, going and buying stuff from Amish, buying from local shops.
[02:02:09.998 --> 02:02:14.541]  Voting with your dollars is a way to actually use their fraudulent currency.
[02:02:14.821 --> 02:02:20.624]  And I think being in their system, but acting wisely within it, is the surest way to change it.
[02:02:21.505 --> 02:02:24.006]  But also working outside of it at the same time.
[02:02:24.026 --> 02:02:26.287]  I think it's a multi-faceted attack profile.
[02:02:26.567 --> 02:02:27.668]  Max Keiser, what do you say?
[02:02:27.688 --> 02:02:32.691]  I like the idea of using the tools of the enemy against them.
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:37.384]  And so two things... You said go after Coca-Cola like five years ago.
[02:02:37.424 --> 02:02:38.084]  They're in trouble.
[02:02:38.725 --> 02:02:40.547]  We've now got McDonald's in trouble.
[02:02:40.567 --> 02:02:41.928]  Sorry, we'll talk about that in the next segment.
[02:02:42.448 --> 02:02:55.962]  Yeah, well, that idea of boycotting companies while selling the stock short, which at the time I called Karma Bank, I'm relaunching that with, hopefully, with Russell Brand here in the United Kingdom.
[02:02:56.042 --> 02:02:58.364]  It's going to be called the True Boycott Hedge Fund.
[02:02:59.210 --> 02:03:01.132]  And we're starting to put that back in place now.
[02:03:01.192 --> 02:03:16.606]  So if you boycott a company and the stock goes down, the hedge fund makes money by making negative bets against that stock and then will do things like use the profits to retire student debt or fund, you know, the victims of Coca-Cola or the victims of McDonald's.
[02:03:17.366 --> 02:03:22.748]  The second way I'm doing it, and I sent Nico the link, is I'm also starting another hedge fund.
[02:03:22.788 --> 02:03:28.390]  Again, the idea is to use the tools against the guys who are doing the most damage.
[02:03:28.831 --> 02:03:30.731]  And this is called Bitcoin Capital.
[02:03:31.392 --> 02:03:32.332]  It's another fund.
[02:03:32.352 --> 02:03:37.414]  It's at bitcoincapital.io is the address for it.
[02:03:38.112 --> 02:03:44.657]  And I'm raising a million dollars for this new fund, and it's going to be used to invest in cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency mining.
[02:03:45.177 --> 02:03:47.139]  Listen, we've had Russell Brand on many times.
[02:03:47.179 --> 02:03:48.100]  I know he's a friend of yours.
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:49.020]  He's a listener of ours.
[02:03:49.481 --> 02:03:50.682]  We've met with him here in Austin.
[02:03:50.702 --> 02:03:55.205]  But I want to get you both on when you launch that to help promote it, because I want to get fully behind that.
[02:03:55.565 --> 02:03:59.108]  Man, I tell you, isn't Russell Brand an imposing person in person?
[02:04:00.689 --> 02:04:02.571]  He's a superstar.
[02:04:04.691 --> 02:04:10.814]  You know, he's got the goods to really lead a political movement in the United Kingdom and around the world.
[02:04:10.874 --> 02:04:12.354]  He just did a fantastic job.
[02:04:12.374 --> 02:04:13.555]  He's talking about independent media.
[02:04:13.955 --> 02:04:17.817]  His truth is now bigger than the Sun newspaper here in the UK.
[02:04:17.917 --> 02:04:22.759]  He just had Ed Miliband, who could quite possibly be the country's prime minister next week.
[02:04:22.799 --> 02:04:26.321]  He just interviewed him on his independent podcast, The Truth, today.
[02:04:26.921 --> 02:04:32.303]  So he's emerging as an enormously influential political figure in the United Kingdom.
[02:04:32.343 --> 02:04:33.904]  He's got followers all over the world.
[02:04:34.691 --> 02:04:37.434]  And we're fortunate to be able to do some things with him.
[02:04:37.454 --> 02:04:40.077]  We're crowdfunding his True's Cafes.
[02:04:40.117 --> 02:04:41.478]  We're doing that all around London.
[02:04:41.799 --> 02:04:44.401]  We've crowdfunded some scratch cards.
[02:04:44.421 --> 02:04:47.024]  We give away crypto to people for free.
[02:04:47.124 --> 02:04:49.407]  The Start Coin, which I created last year.
[02:04:49.887 --> 02:04:53.371]  We have a deal with Russell where we just give him away free.
[02:04:53.591 --> 02:04:54.492]  It's very exciting.
[02:04:54.552 --> 02:04:56.514]  I tell you in person, I've been around a lot of famous people.
[02:04:56.855 --> 02:04:58.316]  He's got a very strong presence.
[02:04:59.237 --> 02:05:00.418]  He's a good guy and he's a listener.
[02:05:00.439 --> 02:05:01.460]  He says we help wake him up.
[02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:03.542]  So I'm proud to see his transformation.
[02:05:04.783 --> 02:05:06.525]  And I like to think he said Katy Perry was a listener.
[02:05:07.026 --> 02:05:08.027]  I know her dad's been on.
[02:05:09.885 --> 02:05:15.626]  I was born on the prairies where the wind blew free, and there was nothing to break the light of the sun.
[02:05:15.986 --> 02:05:18.547]  I was born where there were no enclosures.
[02:05:18.887 --> 02:05:19.487]  Geronimo.
[02:05:20.087 --> 02:05:32.449]  I wonder what he thinks of the permanent checkpoints, where you're quizzed about your citizenship, about having to submit to bag searches to ride public transportation, his thoughts on non-violent offenders riding away in prisons.
[02:05:32.749 --> 02:05:36.470]  They say that in these current times we are more, quote, civilized
[02:05:36.690 --> 02:05:38.711]  But are we really more free?
[02:05:39.211 --> 02:05:46.756]  When the Persian army demanded King Leonidas and his Spartans surrender their arms, the outnumbered king shouted, ''Molon labe!''
[02:05:47.016 --> 02:05:47.876]  or ''Come and take them!''
[02:05:48.277 --> 02:05:54.280]  Even though Leonidas was eventually defeated by a much larger adversary, he is not remembered for his loss.
[02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:58.326]  He lives in history as a beacon of defiance and self-defense.
[02:05:58.566 --> 02:06:01.691]  The desire to disarm the people is nothing new.
[02:06:02.012 --> 02:06:09.023]  Arm yourself with knowledge at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.TV, and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:06:10.589 --> 02:06:11.649]  In the near future.
[02:06:11.909 --> 02:06:16.070]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:17.430]  Security alert.
[02:06:17.630 --> 02:06:19.371]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:06:19.651 --> 02:06:20.271]  Analysis.
[02:06:20.511 --> 02:06:21.171]  InfoWars.
[02:06:21.251 --> 02:06:23.191]  Building independent media operations.
[02:06:23.211 --> 02:06:28.192]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:06:28.232 --> 02:06:29.192]  Prime Directive.
[02:06:29.272 --> 02:06:30.712]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:06:30.813 --> 02:06:33.593]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:06:33.653 --> 02:06:36.734]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:06:36.914 --> 02:06:39.074]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:06:39.394 --> 02:06:40.694]  People are assaulting us!
[02:06:40.714 --> 02:06:43.015]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:06:43.575 --> 02:06:45.235]  They're never going to stop.
[02:06:45.495 --> 02:06:49.436]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[02:06:59.518 --> 02:07:03.919]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.

[02:07:09.113 --> 02:07:12.575]  What lies at the heart of InfoWars and everything we do?
[02:07:13.316 --> 02:07:20.721]  At the core is fellow human beings of every race, color, and creed across the United States of the planet that believe in personal liberty.
[02:07:21.081 --> 02:07:24.824]  And it's people like you that have promoted the radio broadcast to their friends and family.
[02:07:24.984 --> 02:07:31.388]  It's people like you that have bought the high-quality products at InfoWarsStore.com that have made everything we do possible.
[02:07:31.528 --> 02:07:33.029]  And that's why I want to salute you.

[02:07:39.373 --> 02:07:41.734]  You stand at the heart of InfoWars.

[02:08:23.192 --> 02:08:27.258]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:08:28.020 --> 02:08:29.482]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:08:34.210 --> 02:08:38.753]  Shortly before his death, Martin Luther King had this to say, and it's the reason they killed him.
[02:08:39.013 --> 02:08:43.556]  He wanted peace, and the power structure wanted violence to discredit.
[02:08:43.596 --> 02:08:44.077]  Here it is.
[02:09:04.650 --> 02:09:07.332]  The Negro ends up on the losing end.
[02:09:07.693 --> 02:09:09.554]  We can't win a violent revolution.
[02:09:09.894 --> 02:09:13.197]  Most of the persons killed in riots are Negroes themselves.
[02:09:14.338 --> 02:09:22.284]  The persons who end up not being able to get milk for their children are Negroes because things where they have to live are destroyed.
[02:09:22.724 --> 02:09:29.049]  So there's no practical or moral answer in the realm of violence to the Negroes' problem.
[02:09:30.919 --> 02:09:38.067]  That's Martin Luther King, and now we again have the big push for more violence in the Justice Department to save us.
[02:09:38.587 --> 02:09:43.412]  We're going to have some breaking news on that coming up in the next segment, but right now we're taking calls from Max Keiser.
[02:09:43.953 --> 02:09:48.638]  I have some Twitter questions here that we're going to get to in a moment as well, but let's move quickly to the calls.
[02:09:49.519 --> 02:09:51.341]  Let's talk to John in New Jersey.
[02:09:51.381 --> 02:09:52.282]  Thanks for holding, John.
[02:09:52.322 --> 02:09:52.783]  You're on the air.
[02:09:54.076 --> 02:09:54.596]  Hi, Max.
[02:09:54.997 --> 02:09:59.880]  I'm wondering, I have most of my money in an IRA, but I'd like to probably get it out.
[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:01.801]  I don't know where to send my money.
[02:10:01.881 --> 02:10:11.867]  I'm so scared about the United States and putting it in one of these funds in gold like Peter Schiff suggests, or I don't know where to even diversify.
[02:10:11.907 --> 02:10:14.568]  You can't get things to Russia if you wanted to put it into rubles.
[02:10:14.648 --> 02:10:17.530]  What do you do, send it to Singapore or Liechtenstein?
[02:10:17.890 --> 02:10:18.311]  I don't know.
[02:10:19.051 --> 02:10:21.813]  Where do you think the best avenues
[02:10:23.514 --> 02:10:35.598]  Well, you know, sometimes I defer to people who I think are really quite competent in answering some of these questions.
[02:10:35.798 --> 02:10:36.598]  I'll give you two answers.
[02:10:36.618 --> 02:10:42.500]  The first one is that if you look up a guy named Doug Casey, I think he's been on your show, Alex, a couple of times.
[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:43.380]  Sure, Doug Casey.
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:44.281]  I want to get him back on.
[02:10:44.881 --> 02:10:47.342]  Yeah, the internationalist or the internationalist living.
[02:10:48.062 --> 02:11:02.414]  And he's fantastic at really diving into how to diversify and how to invest and how to escape, you know, being caught up in one location and not able to get any freedom at all.
[02:11:02.854 --> 02:11:10.920]  The second thing I'll point out, I just heard this, it's kind of an interesting story, is that, you know, the dollar right now is going up because the derivative markets and everything's priced in derivatives.
[02:11:11.581 --> 02:11:16.885]  As the derivative markets are being shut down because of this global deflation problem,
[02:11:17.938 --> 02:11:19.899]  There's actually a rush to buy U.S.
[02:11:19.939 --> 02:11:25.660]  dollars because they're priced in dollars and the big institutional players need to buy dollars.
[02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:28.261]  At some point when that ends, then the dollar collapses.
[02:11:28.321 --> 02:11:34.222]  And the way to play this on both sides is the Hong Kong dollar, because the Hong Kong dollar is actually pegged to the U.S.
[02:11:34.262 --> 02:11:34.542]  dollar.
[02:11:34.582 --> 02:11:36.743]  So you get the ride on the way up.
[02:11:40.382 --> 02:11:53.148]  I was about to say, it's a dangerous game if you're not an expert, but you can ride the expanding stock markets, you can ride the other currencies if you're an expert in doing it every day.
[02:11:53.168 --> 02:11:58.210]  I understand this stuff, but I don't even try to do it because it's so dangerous.
[02:11:58.890 --> 02:11:59.291]  Who is again?
[02:12:07.779 --> 02:12:08.600]  Doug Casey?
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:09.820]  C-A-S-E-Y?
[02:12:09.841 --> 02:12:10.321]  Sure, sure.
[02:12:10.361 --> 02:12:11.222]  I knew you said Doug Casey.
[02:12:11.262 --> 02:12:11.922]  I was just talking over here.
[02:12:11.942 --> 02:12:13.043]  I thought you might have said somebody else.
[02:12:13.403 --> 02:12:14.744]  Who else do you like to listen to?
[02:12:16.205 --> 02:12:22.690]  Well, as for the individual who is looking for solutions, I think Doug is a great guy.
[02:12:22.750 --> 02:12:26.953]  But broadly speaking, I listen to the same guys that you listen to.
[02:12:26.993 --> 02:12:29.295]  Mark Faber, Peter Schiff.
[02:12:29.315 --> 02:12:31.236]  You know, these guys I think are clued in.
[02:12:31.896 --> 02:12:35.639]  And at the moment, we're all kind of
[02:12:38.049 --> 02:12:51.276]  On the receiving end of this enormous market failure, driven by the central banks themselves, is buying all the bonds that they themselves are issuing.
[02:12:51.757 --> 02:12:54.198]  And that is a definition of a Ponzi scheme.
[02:12:54.398 --> 02:13:01.162]  And exactly when that breaks, you know, nobody knows for sure, but it's not a healthy situation.
[02:13:01.222 --> 02:13:03.423]  So being prepared ahead of time, though, makes sense.
[02:13:04.619 --> 02:13:07.322]  Well, it certainly does, and there's different strategies.
[02:13:07.342 --> 02:13:18.773]  You can be a prepper, have a low-level job, small place out in the country, develop your own economy, meet a lot of people you know, work in a machine shop, work with the Amish, just become self-sufficient.
[02:13:18.813 --> 02:13:19.934]  That's one survival model.
[02:13:20.275 --> 02:13:24.939]  Then there's learn how everything works, manipulate the globalist system, because an internationalist
[02:13:25.911 --> 02:13:27.092]  He's not a globalist.
[02:13:27.592 --> 02:13:32.555]  An internationalist knows how to go from country to country and use the diversity for security and profit.
[02:13:32.815 --> 02:13:41.980]  The globalists want to end any real diversity, end country firewalls, and create a systematic corporate global fascist governance worldwide.
[02:13:42.361 --> 02:13:45.262]  Max, you think that's an accurate definition?
[02:13:45.983 --> 02:13:46.703]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[02:13:47.664 --> 02:13:55.048]  The internationalist, as Doug Casey describes it, he would have a company registered in one country, a passport in a second country, and live in a third country.
[02:13:55.968 --> 02:13:58.769]  And this way, you've got some protection against the globalists.
[02:13:59.189 --> 02:14:04.271]  You know, the people who want to introduce one world government and shut down territories one by one.
[02:14:04.651 --> 02:14:07.112]  You want to be able to try to stay one step ahead of that.
[02:14:07.933 --> 02:14:11.334]  And the way that he describes it, and he's been around for many years.
[02:14:11.354 --> 02:14:13.915]  I actually used to read his research 25 years ago.
[02:14:13.935 --> 02:14:15.716]  He's the guy of the long, long time.
[02:14:15.876 --> 02:14:17.356]  He's like Bill Chapman almost.
[02:14:17.396 --> 02:14:18.697]  He's like been around for 40 years.
[02:14:20.041 --> 02:14:25.965]  Uh, you know, he's just, he's a veteran and a lot of people don't follow him because he's just been like part of the landscape.
[02:14:26.305 --> 02:14:31.028]  But for the people in the know, I think his insights are extremely valuable.
[02:14:32.623 --> 02:14:33.143]  Absolutely.
[02:14:33.184 --> 02:14:37.767]  I don't have guests on this show unless they've been accurate, like, 90% of the time.
[02:14:38.367 --> 02:14:42.270]  And you turn into MSNBC or CNBC, it's like 90% inaccurate.
[02:14:42.570 --> 02:14:43.911]  It's not that they're even stupid.
[02:14:44.212 --> 02:14:46.333]  They have a script to feed their victims.
[02:14:46.914 --> 02:14:49.876]  And I will not be part of victimizing my audience, and you won't either.
[02:14:50.156 --> 02:14:51.217]  I think that's what it comes down to.
[02:14:51.237 --> 02:14:52.778]  It's not like we're angels or something.
[02:14:53.158 --> 02:14:55.360]  But man, I'm not knocking old ladies in the head, Max.
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:58.122]  And I'm telling you, that's what CNN and others are doing.
[02:14:59.113 --> 02:15:01.074]  Yeah, well, a quick correction.
[02:15:01.114 --> 02:15:02.194]  I said Bill, I meant Bob.
[02:15:02.254 --> 02:15:04.094]  Bob Chapin, of course.
[02:15:04.114 --> 02:15:06.455]  Just to honor the memory of Bob.
[02:15:06.495 --> 02:15:07.915]  Sure, the international forecaster.
[02:15:08.456 --> 02:15:10.096]  Yeah, great, great, great guest on your show.
[02:15:10.456 --> 02:15:17.738]  But, you know, I agree with you, but I think that, as we were talking earlier, how the U.S.
[02:15:17.758 --> 02:15:28.261]  government, through things like the Voice of America and the Broadcasting Board of Governors, is panicking into kind of revealing the fact that they have nothing to offer
[02:15:28.959 --> 02:15:32.920]  Through their media outlets, other than to try to discredit legitimate news organizations.
[02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:35.420]  And their numbers are going down to almost nothing.
[02:15:36.301 --> 02:15:37.901]  We're almost reaching a singularity.
[02:15:37.961 --> 02:15:39.121]  I don't know what they're going to do.
[02:15:39.141 --> 02:15:42.102]  I mean, they're going to come after us, and then that will only make us heroes.
[02:15:43.322 --> 02:15:44.122]  It's just amazing.
[02:15:44.162 --> 02:15:45.743]  But it's going to be one hell of a fight, folks.
[02:15:45.843 --> 02:15:47.403]  I mean, they're not down, believe me.
[02:15:47.743 --> 02:15:49.083]  Let's talk to Adam in California.
[02:15:49.103 --> 02:15:50.184]  You're on the air with Max Keiser.
[02:15:51.964 --> 02:15:53.344]  Hello, Alex and Max.
[02:15:53.984 --> 02:15:54.344]  Welcome.
[02:15:54.885 --> 02:15:56.525]  It's Adam from San Diego.
[02:15:57.287 --> 02:15:58.409]  Welcome to WOMP!
[02:15:58.429 --> 02:15:59.410]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[02:16:00.051 --> 02:16:02.114]  Hey Alex, it's Adam from No More News.
[02:16:02.415 --> 02:16:04.518]  I did this subliminal piece from Comedy Central.
[02:16:05.079 --> 02:16:07.463]  That's right, you found them subliminally attacking InfoWars.
[02:16:07.503 --> 02:16:08.685]  There's a lot of examples of that.
[02:16:09.727 --> 02:16:19.113]  Yeah, they're over-the-top, tons of examples, and it's so important you guys are talking about the conspiracy theory term, because it's the most powerful tool the establishment uses to keep the masses in a trance.
[02:16:19.514 --> 02:16:25.118]  There's no question Liz Wall was talking about you in that press conference, and there's a whole campaign out to get you.
[02:16:25.158 --> 02:16:33.543]  I posted the documentary I created on InfoWars on Friday, and they played it 10 minutes on the radio, and it's Alex Jones versus the mainstream media.
[02:16:33.583 --> 02:16:35.225]  I was wondering, you're out all week, did you see it?
[02:16:35.525 --> 02:16:37.066]  I did watch it, yes, I did watch it.
[02:16:38.755 --> 02:16:40.356]  I downloaded it and watched it on a plane ride.
[02:16:41.176 --> 02:16:41.777]  So good job.
[02:16:41.837 --> 02:16:43.217]  Thank you for defending me.
[02:16:43.658 --> 02:16:47.560]  Because if I don't get defended, the rest of the media, the new media, won't get defended.
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:49.541]  If they can take me down, they can take everybody down.
[02:16:49.941 --> 02:16:52.182]  And who they talk about is Drudge and Alex Jones.
[02:16:52.522 --> 02:16:57.105]  And if they can knock those two things down, then they can get the Max Kisers and everybody else.
[02:16:57.145 --> 02:16:58.025]  It doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[02:16:58.045 --> 02:16:59.066]  It doesn't mean Drudge is perfect.
[02:16:59.466 --> 02:17:02.868]  It just means if they can take me down, they can take everybody down.
[02:17:03.788 --> 02:17:06.450]  And Max Keiser, I know you're getting attacked as well.
[02:17:06.751 --> 02:17:08.072]  They are really coming after me.
[02:17:08.112 --> 02:17:09.352]  What do you think that signifies?
[02:17:09.372 --> 02:17:18.339]  Oh, I think this is my own strategy is that I'm not going to get worried until they come after you, Alex, as long as you're still alive and I know I'm safe.
[02:17:19.039 --> 02:17:20.481]  So you keep doing what you're doing.
[02:17:21.161 --> 02:17:24.463]  And you know that old joke about how do you run away from a bear?
[02:17:24.584 --> 02:17:28.166]  You don't have to run away from the bear, just run away from the guy who you're with.
[02:17:28.226 --> 02:17:30.448]  Just as long as you're faster than that guy, you'll be safe.
[02:17:30.919 --> 02:17:32.060]  Well, I mean, let's be clear.
[02:17:32.100 --> 02:17:35.983]  If they kill me or set me up, I knew what I was doing, I'd still win.
[02:17:36.004 --> 02:17:37.124]  I mean, let's be clear.
[02:17:37.145 --> 02:17:39.346]  Obi-Wan Kenobi knew he was walking up against Darth Vader.
[02:17:39.747 --> 02:17:43.830]  He'll be very kind at your memorial service, no doubt.
[02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:47.333]  Sounds like a long vacation.
[02:17:47.414 --> 02:17:50.196]  I'll probably show up in Austin the next day, you know, carpetbagging.
[02:17:50.596 --> 02:17:53.179]  Be like, oh, Alex Jones, he was a great guy.
[02:17:53.199 --> 02:17:56.221]  Stay right next door, we got another show coming up.
[02:17:56.582 --> 02:17:57.883]  You know, we're just gonna swoop right in.
[02:17:59.184 --> 02:18:05.635]  I hope people swoop right in if they get me, but the point is they are coming after us, which shows what we're talking about really scares them.
[02:18:05.915 --> 02:18:07.738]  And so I see this as the proof of success.
[02:18:08.379 --> 02:18:10.102]  Adam, real quick, what's your question for Max?
[02:18:11.721 --> 02:18:15.362]  My question for Max is, the financial system is a scam.
[02:18:15.402 --> 02:18:16.643]  We print money from nothing.
[02:18:16.963 --> 02:18:22.025]  Can the money masters just keep printing money forever until we have just like, you know... That's right.
[02:18:22.085 --> 02:18:24.686]  How long does this delusional economy go?
[02:18:24.746 --> 02:18:25.906]  It's never gone this long.
[02:18:26.186 --> 02:18:28.827]  Not in Zimbabwe, not in Weimar, Germany.
[02:18:29.168 --> 02:18:31.829]  How long can Alice in Wonderland Tea Party continue?
[02:18:33.729 --> 02:18:40.732]  Until Russia and China say, that's enough is enough, and they introduce a gold-backed currency.
[02:18:41.730 --> 02:18:42.691]  Alright, thank you Adam.
[02:18:42.971 --> 02:18:44.353]  Let's jam in one more or two more.
[02:18:44.413 --> 02:18:45.974]  John in Illinois, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:18:48.877 --> 02:18:49.297]  Hello?
[02:18:49.637 --> 02:18:51.079]  Yes, welcome my friend.
[02:18:51.099 --> 02:18:54.702]  Hi Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:18:54.762 --> 02:18:56.023]  This is Smitty.
[02:18:56.043 --> 02:19:03.971]  I was just listening to the psychotic conservative circle jerk you're having on there today.
[02:19:05.950 --> 02:19:08.671]  Hold on, we're skipping, hold on Smitty.
[02:19:09.011 --> 02:19:10.592]  Oh, hey, what's going on?
[02:19:10.632 --> 02:19:13.653]  We're skipping this network break just to spend a few more minutes with Max Keiser.
[02:19:13.673 --> 02:19:15.873]  He's got to go do another interview here in just a few minutes.
[02:19:15.913 --> 02:19:20.255]  How come nobody's asked you about your claim of being the white Bruce Lee?
[02:19:20.315 --> 02:19:22.536]  I thought that would be more, you know, questionable.
[02:19:24.076 --> 02:19:25.177]  I didn't mean it as an insult.
[02:19:25.257 --> 02:19:26.997]  I meant I was good looking like Bruce Lee.
[02:19:27.017 --> 02:19:29.738]  Yeah, I know.
[02:19:30.058 --> 02:19:31.999]  That's me too.
[02:19:32.999 --> 02:19:34.620]  You kind of look like Bruce Lee actually.
[02:19:35.441 --> 02:19:37.382]  Yeah, you know, Bruce Lee is the man.
[02:19:39.604 --> 02:19:41.205]  Bruce Lee meets Kermit the Frog.
[02:19:41.225 --> 02:19:42.646]  That equals Max Keiser.
[02:19:43.266 --> 02:19:46.028]  You're saying you were at one time the white Bruce Lee.
[02:19:46.108 --> 02:19:46.928]  I'm thinking, damn!
[02:19:47.169 --> 02:19:51.932]  Chuck Norris is a daily listener and he says he can clean the floor with Bruce Lee.
[02:19:52.892 --> 02:19:53.793]  And he fought him.
[02:19:54.133 --> 02:19:55.654]  What was the movie where he fights him to the death?
[02:19:55.674 --> 02:19:58.276]  Was it Enter the Dragon?
[02:19:58.316 --> 02:19:59.516]  Enter the Dragon, yes.
[02:20:00.277 --> 02:20:02.118]  Yeah, well, you know, nobody beats Chuck Norris.
[02:20:02.138 --> 02:20:04.840]  Chuck Norris is, you know, he's the man.
[02:20:05.749 --> 02:20:08.211]  But anyway, when are you coming on my show, Big Daddy?
[02:20:08.231 --> 02:20:12.495]  You talking about Big Chuck Norris?
[02:20:13.316 --> 02:20:13.856]  No, you!
[02:20:14.036 --> 02:20:15.117]  No, you, the white person!
[02:20:15.237 --> 02:20:16.338]  I will come on!
[02:20:16.358 --> 02:20:18.360]  The white devil will come on whenever you want!
[02:20:18.380 --> 02:20:20.021]  You're coming on my show!
[02:20:20.082 --> 02:20:22.163]  The Mayor McCheese of Austin, Texas!
[02:20:22.223 --> 02:20:24.125]  Anytime you want me, Cupcake.
[02:20:24.165 --> 02:20:26.507]  No, but seriously, Schmitty just hung up.
[02:20:27.488 --> 02:20:28.729]  Oh, no, no, he's still on.
[02:20:29.330 --> 02:20:30.711]  He lied and said his name is John.
[02:20:30.811 --> 02:20:31.191]  Okay.
[02:20:31.611 --> 02:20:32.933]  No, Schmitty claims he's a liberal.
[02:20:34.833 --> 02:20:39.534]  I don't think modern liberals are even liberals, but Max Keiser is definitely not a conservative.
[02:20:39.935 --> 02:20:41.895]  He's like an internationalist libertarian.
[02:20:42.175 --> 02:20:43.916]  Probably you call him liberal, Schmitty.
[02:20:44.376 --> 02:20:53.139]  Why are you, John, Schmitty calling himself John, why on earth are you lying to the white bristly right now?
[02:20:55.379 --> 02:21:00.081]  Well, sir, actually I don't know if your guest knows this, but if he has taken any
[02:21:01.684 --> 02:21:02.285]  I don't know.
[02:21:23.431 --> 02:21:27.853]  And even though you're not quite Jabba the Hutt, you're still a pretty fat turd, my friend.
[02:21:28.154 --> 02:21:35.938]  You have a long way to go before you can call yourself... No, I mean, I've got a little bit of belly fat when I'm, you know, got my clothes off, and I've lost a ton of weight.
[02:21:35.958 --> 02:21:36.738]  I have a big head.
[02:21:36.758 --> 02:21:38.179]  Maybe you're talking about that.
[02:21:38.799 --> 02:21:41.060]  But let's not get off into a discussion about Alex Jones.
[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:42.601]  I'm just trying to get in shape.
[02:21:42.621 --> 02:21:44.462]  I'm not trying to be a beauty queen here.
[02:21:44.482 --> 02:21:47.404]  And I was just talking about what supplementation has done for me.
[02:21:47.424 --> 02:21:49.265]  So do you want to do ad hominem attacks?
[02:21:49.285 --> 02:21:51.566]  Do you have a question for Max Keiser?
[02:21:53.591 --> 02:21:55.853]  I have a question for Max Keiser.
[02:21:56.313 --> 02:21:57.574]  I guess I'll just make one up.
[02:21:57.594 --> 02:22:16.168]  I really called in to just make fun of you, Alex Jones, and all of your wingnut psycho listeners, but I'm wondering why Max Keiser is directing people to buy silver and gold and things like that when nobody can even spend it, no matter what happens.
[02:22:16.656 --> 02:22:20.860]  How are you going to spend a bunch of pieces of silver if there's an economic collapse?
[02:22:21.260 --> 02:22:24.042]  It's not really... It shows how ignorant this guy is, Max.
[02:22:24.323 --> 02:22:30.648]  Yeah, Max, why has JP Morgan been buying it at record levels and just bought 50 million ounces of physical?
[02:22:30.988 --> 02:22:34.591]  Why are the Chinese and Russians and the University of Texas and the U.S.
[02:22:34.631 --> 02:22:36.353]  government buying it as fast as they can?
[02:22:36.873 --> 02:22:38.455]  Why are Indians buying it?
[02:22:38.475 --> 02:22:40.076]  Why are Chinese commoners buying it?
[02:22:40.396 --> 02:22:40.556]  Why?
[02:22:40.576 --> 02:22:41.697]  These are horrible people.
[02:22:41.757 --> 02:22:49.784]  As the globe accelerates a currency devaluation race, I mean, that'd be like saying Zimbabweans should have bought gold or silver 20 years ago.
[02:22:49.804 --> 02:22:51.125]  Of course, they'd be stingy.
[02:22:51.566 --> 02:22:53.708]  The question is, I hear the question many times.
[02:22:53.748 --> 02:22:58.752]  In other words, it's also this question, you can't eat gold.
[02:22:59.032 --> 02:23:03.236]  What value, if there's a collapse, what value does the gold and silver have?
[02:23:03.256 --> 02:23:04.677]  It's true, you can only wipe your butt with paper.
[02:23:05.549 --> 02:23:10.862]  This is a question that comes up over and over again, and the answer is a couple of answers.
[02:23:10.902 --> 02:23:11.323]  First of all...
[02:23:13.398 --> 02:23:17.379]  No one is ever going to not take their gold in an emergency.
[02:23:17.499 --> 02:23:24.281]  If there is an emergency, it certainly looks like financial systems are under a great deal of stress again.
[02:23:25.141 --> 02:23:27.781]  And banks are shut down, as they have been.
[02:23:27.821 --> 02:23:29.642]  Like Cyprus, they had their wealth confiscated.
[02:23:29.662 --> 02:23:31.962]  The Greek banks are almost completely bankrupt.
[02:23:32.882 --> 02:23:37.663]  In France, you can't take out more than a thousand euros on any one trip or one week.
[02:23:38.243 --> 02:23:39.224]  They're clamping down.
[02:23:39.244 --> 02:23:40.724]  They're introducing capital controls.
[02:23:41.324 --> 02:23:56.269]  So, if you have therefore gold, and you, let's say, need to make a purchase over a thousand euros, or you need to get out of the country, or you need medical help, or you need an emergency help, nobody is not going to take your gold.
[02:23:56.349 --> 02:23:58.670]  Gold has always been accepted as a medium of exchange.
[02:23:58.690 --> 02:24:04.872]  You can always cash it in when they've devalued a currency for even more of the currency, so that you can then use that.
[02:24:04.912 --> 02:24:06.392]  It's liquid, it's portable.
[02:24:07.533 --> 02:24:08.593]  Let me ask Schmidty something.
[02:24:09.153 --> 02:24:15.455]  Schmitty, Schmitty, Schmitty, Schmitty, why are you people so against any other form of asset than the fiat currency?
[02:24:15.795 --> 02:24:17.795]  I mean, is it true that you're a turd burglar?
[02:24:19.276 --> 02:24:21.756]  Well, I do have a golden pleasure wand.
[02:24:23.117 --> 02:24:24.657]  I also have a silver pleasure wand.
[02:24:24.737 --> 02:24:25.517]  Okay, alright.
[02:24:25.998 --> 02:24:26.398]  I knew it.
[02:24:26.438 --> 02:24:32.639]  This guy, I talk to him in South Parkian language because Schmitty is actually, Schmitty's not your name.
[02:24:33.039 --> 02:24:34.600]  Is your real name really Lemmy Lynx?
[02:24:38.456 --> 02:24:40.998]  This guy, his mind is in the toilet.
[02:24:41.038 --> 02:24:43.440]  Alex, are you sure that you're not homosexual, my friend?
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:50.244]  You have this brunt of having this family and whatever.
[02:24:50.264 --> 02:24:57.429]  Michelle Obama is the first tranny in the White House.
[02:24:58.270 --> 02:24:59.911]  You're not married to a tranny, are you?
[02:25:00.251 --> 02:25:00.812]  Like Barack?
[02:25:02.634 --> 02:25:05.117]  Alright, Smitty, okay, this is disintegrated.
[02:25:05.317 --> 02:25:07.580]  Smitty, I'm gonna put Smitty on hold.
[02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:10.002]  Max, I apologize for that type of caller, my friend.
[02:25:10.223 --> 02:25:12.245]  Let me give you the two minutes of your closing comment.
[02:25:12.445 --> 02:25:13.746]  Talk about some serious issues.
[02:25:15.128 --> 02:25:16.209]  Okay, what do you want to talk about?
[02:25:16.229 --> 02:25:17.771]  You want to talk about the fact that HSBC
[02:25:19.070 --> 02:25:24.533]  The biggest bank in Europe is being chased out of Britain because they've been committing too many crimes.
[02:25:24.793 --> 02:25:25.873]  They were in LIBOR rigging.
[02:25:26.333 --> 02:25:28.995]  They introduced 100,000 fake Swiss accounts.
[02:25:29.035 --> 02:25:29.955]  They violated U.S.
[02:25:29.975 --> 02:25:31.536]  sanctions with Iran.
[02:25:32.056 --> 02:25:34.797]  They were sent a cease and desist letter by the U.S.
[02:25:34.817 --> 02:25:39.600]  government to stop funding Al-Qaeda, and they did not fulfill that request.
[02:25:40.020 --> 02:25:44.922]  And they've been involved in the Sinaloa drug cartel with 60,000 dead, laundering money for them.
[02:25:45.162 --> 02:25:46.723]  Many of them by beheadings.
[02:25:46.863 --> 02:25:48.064]  Now they're leaving the U.K.
[02:25:49.064 --> 02:25:51.945]  And they're seeking to move the headquarters somewhere else.
[02:25:51.965 --> 02:25:53.806]  That's the kind of work we're doing as journalists.
[02:25:53.906 --> 02:25:55.886]  We're forcing them out of the UK.
[02:25:56.226 --> 02:26:08.090]  Wonga, the predatory payday lender, they had huge losses because of our show, Kaiser Report, exposing them in the UK for charging people 5,000% interest rates.
[02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:15.192]  And now they're looking to change their name, to try to escape their legacy of being a predatory monopolist and lender and scoundrel.
[02:26:15.732 --> 02:26:19.033]  McDonald's is starting to go bankrupt, Coca-Cola's in trouble.
[02:26:19.634 --> 02:26:23.575]  I mean, all these, and again, these are the folks that are funding anti-gun initiatives, open borders.
[02:26:24.015 --> 02:26:27.377]  I mean, the globalists are pretty easy to beat, Max, if we just decide we can beat them.
[02:26:28.757 --> 02:26:29.618]  That's exactly right.
[02:26:29.918 --> 02:26:36.500]  And, you know, your show, if anyone tells me that, oh, Alex Jones' stuff is far out, I say, give it 18 months.
[02:26:37.761 --> 02:26:42.863]  At most, 80% of everything you think sounds crazy, in 18 months, it becomes part of the public record.
[02:26:43.919 --> 02:26:45.360]  What about the other 20, though, Max?
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:54.103]  The other percentage is like, you know, falls under the category of, you know, the white Bruce Lee claim, which I'm still having trouble wrapping my mind around.
[02:26:54.183 --> 02:26:55.443]  Well, it's called a joke.
[02:26:56.684 --> 02:26:57.104]  I get it.
[02:26:58.124 --> 02:26:59.565]  I mean, we gotta have a little fun here.
[02:26:59.705 --> 02:27:00.785]  It's very poetic.
[02:27:01.345 --> 02:27:03.526]  But when I joke around, it's a joke.
[02:27:03.566 --> 02:27:04.427]  It's pretty obvious.
[02:27:05.147 --> 02:27:10.129]  You know, when I was at your facilities... The truth is I beat up Chuck Norris.
[02:27:10.189 --> 02:27:10.689]  Okay, it's true.
[02:27:11.260 --> 02:27:19.562]  They run wild in the warehouse, and I was able to run away with several t-shirts that I wear with great pride around London.
[02:27:19.602 --> 02:27:22.502]  The Molon Labe, InfoWars.
[02:27:22.622 --> 02:27:24.403]  If you see somebody in London wearing these shirts, that's me.
[02:27:24.523 --> 02:27:27.623]  Because I think InfoWars is the best.
[02:27:28.163 --> 02:27:29.684]  Is that a democracy now?
[02:27:29.964 --> 02:27:33.245]  Are the only two journalistic outlets in the U.S.
[02:27:33.265 --> 02:27:38.025]  Well, what's amazing, Max, we appreciate that, MaxKaiser.com, is I did take the family sports fishing.
[02:27:38.086 --> 02:27:39.846]  I haven't taken them on a vacation in like a year.
[02:27:40.506 --> 02:27:43.829]  Because we were rained out, had family stuff going on during the spring breaks, we didn't go.
[02:27:43.849 --> 02:27:53.016]  I went to Cancun, I went to Ila Mujeres, and I literally had almost more fans in Mexico than I have in Austin, Texas.
[02:27:53.476 --> 02:27:59.541]  Hotel managers, bartenders, the lady cleaning the room, you know, just everywhere were listeners.
[02:28:00.182 --> 02:28:07.207]  And it's so crazy how when I was in London, I got mobbed, just live feeds at Big Bend, people just walking by, Brits were listeners.
[02:28:07.848 --> 02:28:08.148]  And then,
[02:28:09.649 --> 02:28:33.528]  Like you said, all these listeners in the Middle East, but it's not about me being big, it's showing that internationally humans want freedom, just like your show is popular worldwide, and that's got to really shake up the globalists, because they're not Americans, they've hijacked this country, and they're scared that people that are real Americans, or just real humans, like our listeners, are wise to them, Max.
[02:28:35.191 --> 02:28:42.335]  Yeah, they're getting, you know, the American Revolution, I think only one-third of the American population was actually for the revolution.
[02:28:43.296 --> 02:28:46.418]  One-third was against it, and one-third was completely ambivalent.
[02:28:46.558 --> 02:28:50.560]  You only need a third of the population to create a revolution.
[02:28:52.261 --> 02:28:53.462]  That's extremely conservative.
[02:28:53.482 --> 02:28:58.705]  It was 3% started it, 5% won it, and then about 30% aided the other 5%.
[02:28:59.285 --> 02:29:00.085]  You're absolutely right.
[02:29:00.306 --> 02:29:04.388]  But 5% actually... You don't need the whole population, or even a majority!
[02:29:05.049 --> 02:29:06.149]  to get a revolution going.
[02:29:06.169 --> 02:29:10.110]  You just need a focused minority and you have your revolution.
[02:29:10.590 --> 02:29:17.992]  And that's why they're scared of us because we are that cadre that can train the mass cadre and have the big win for a worldwide renaissance.
[02:29:18.052 --> 02:29:22.853]  MaxKaiser.com from the front lines of the renaissance reporting from Albion.
[02:29:23.534 --> 02:29:24.214]  Thank you so much.
[02:29:24.234 --> 02:29:27.054]  People can find all your informative reports at MaxKaiser.com.
[02:29:27.615 --> 02:29:28.375]  My pleasure, Alex.
[02:29:28.415 --> 02:29:28.815]  See you soon.
[02:29:29.315 --> 02:29:29.855]  See you later.
[02:29:29.895 --> 02:29:30.536]  Thank you, Max.
[02:29:30.676 --> 02:29:31.636]  Boy, that was a good interview.
[02:29:32.117 --> 02:29:33.177]  A lot of stuff got covered.
[02:29:33.238 --> 02:29:35.179]  Okay, I said I'd give you the definition of thuggy.
[02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:40.682]  We'll cover thuggy when we come back, because they're now saying it's racist to call looters thugs.
[02:29:41.343 --> 02:29:45.145]  So I'll just attack it with knowledge, which is satanic in nature, of course.
[02:29:45.565 --> 02:29:47.246]  All knowledge is evil, according to the establishment.
[02:29:47.707 --> 02:29:50.348]  You need to learn one word, racism, or two words, homophobe.
[02:29:50.368 --> 02:29:52.550]  Then you just say that, you know, pay the rent.
[02:29:52.810 --> 02:29:53.470]  Racist, homophobe.
[02:29:54.271 --> 02:29:54.931]  I don't want to be killed.
[02:29:54.971 --> 02:29:55.572]  Racist, homophobe.
[02:29:55.872 --> 02:29:56.492]  I want to be free.
[02:29:56.672 --> 02:29:57.333]  Shut up, racist.
[02:29:58.974 --> 02:30:01.995]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.915 --> 02:30:05.696]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.817 --> 02:30:12.337]  Let's talk about the real war on women.
[02:30:12.858 --> 02:30:16.819]  First wave feminism was a noble cause, but modern feminists?
[02:30:17.179 --> 02:30:17.339]  Ha!
[02:30:17.699 --> 02:30:25.621]  Well, instead of fighting for, say, paid and protected maternity leave, they want to ban words, shirts, and manspreading.
[02:30:26.081 --> 02:30:26.741]  Come on!
[02:30:27.102 --> 02:30:34.286]  That's cultural Marxism, which asserts that culture and language is responsible for oppressing women, and not the state.
[02:30:34.626 --> 02:30:37.968]  The truth is, the state encourages gender wars.
[02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:42.311]  It's a divide-and-conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst ourselves.
[02:30:42.691 --> 02:30:47.294]  In fact, the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to exploit women.
[02:30:47.594 --> 02:30:51.577]  As the late Aaron Russo revealed, the Rockefellers bankrolled feminism.
[02:30:52.057 --> 02:30:58.503]  Not because they had any interest in women's rights, but because women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta.
[02:30:58.684 --> 02:31:05.871]  The state collects more tax dollars, children are indoctrinated at an earlier age, and the traditional family structure destroyed.
[02:31:06.231 --> 02:31:09.034]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[02:31:09.771 --> 02:31:13.973]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.

[02:33:27.149 --> 02:33:28.309]  InfoWarsLive.
[02:33:28.830 --> 02:33:29.730]  We're here weekdays.
[02:33:30.371 --> 02:33:33.373]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:33.953 --> 02:33:35.294]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:37.076 --> 02:33:38.371]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:42.179 --> 02:33:42.999]  I like that horn.
[02:33:43.019 --> 02:33:49.081]  Coming up, I've got some really good news that I should have led the broadcast with today, but that's why the third hour is so important.
[02:33:49.121 --> 02:33:52.342]  We ended up getting to more of the news than other hours sometimes.
[02:33:52.362 --> 02:33:54.203]  This is out of London Guardian, and it is a
[02:34:12.094 --> 02:34:33.726]  Amazing backtrack and it ties into brave EPA and FDA scientists in 2001 and again in 2011 that took the time to get thousands of scientists in each body.
[02:34:34.006 --> 02:34:41.410]  In fact, in the FDA, they got something like 98% of the scientists and toxicologists
[02:34:43.652 --> 02:34:54.854]  To sign letters to the directors of their agencies calling for the immediate abolition of hydrofluorosilic acid being added to the water.
[02:34:57.155 --> 02:35:05.556]  And finally, Congress acted quietly and said you need to reduce it from 1.2 parts to 0.7.
[02:35:11.394 --> 02:35:13.795]  This is a devastating victory.
[02:35:16.857 --> 02:35:29.403]  Just like Chipotle just announced they're not going to have any GMO, and Tyson Chicken, right after McDonald's announced it, just announced they're going to stop feeding antibiotics to chickens.
[02:35:33.145 --> 02:35:35.587]  Another devastating victory from CNN.
[02:35:38.308 --> 02:35:41.591]  They are now announcing that they're going to cut the fluoride in the water by half.
[02:35:42.451 --> 02:35:57.504]  That means that your IQs will only be reduced by about five to six points, and it means you will have a lower level of bone cancer, not the seven-fold increase, only three percent or so, or three-time increase, that's very loving, and all the other things it's connected to.
[02:35:58.956 --> 02:36:04.518]  But the reason it's such a big victory is we can really, really go after the city councils now.
[02:36:04.918 --> 02:36:09.320]  I mean, folks, if their fluoride fraud falls, it all falls.
[02:36:14.262 --> 02:36:16.123]  You know, I try to not talk like Batman.
[02:36:17.723 --> 02:36:18.684]  Christian Bale Batman.
[02:36:19.946 --> 02:36:26.453]  So I try, unlike other talk show hosts, to talk with a high-pitched voice compared to my real voice.
[02:36:27.013 --> 02:36:28.194]  But I have a worn-out voice.
[02:36:28.234 --> 02:36:29.415]  I never took speech lessons.
[02:36:31.137 --> 02:36:32.779]  Plus, there's a lot of pollen in Austin right now.
[02:36:32.819 --> 02:36:42.589]  And last night, my son told me that I sounded like a cross between Oscar the Grouch and Batman.
[02:36:44.258 --> 02:36:47.860]  Because I was like, alright, I'm not going to cook you another snack.
[02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:51.482]  You've already eaten dinner, just get a glass of milk if you want some fruit.
[02:36:52.342 --> 02:36:54.844]  It's 10.30, you're up out of bed, I want to go to sleep.
[02:36:56.084 --> 02:37:02.608]  Last night I really had a hoarse voice from the pollen, but I sounded just like, it's ridiculous.
[02:37:04.128 --> 02:37:08.491]  And then I hear myself sometimes when I really start talking like I sound now.
[02:37:09.767 --> 02:37:18.834]  I gotta go take speech lessons or something on how to keep my voice because I talk so much and I don't talk in a way that doesn't blow out my larynx from all my yelling and screaming over the years.
[02:37:19.594 --> 02:37:22.777]  And so my voice is becoming more toad-like by the minute.
[02:37:23.497 --> 02:37:25.619]  Pretty soon I'll just be like, ribbit, ribbit.
[02:37:26.720 --> 02:37:30.443]  But that is another career though in this.
[02:37:30.603 --> 02:37:33.545]  I can go off and do voiceovers, I guess.
[02:37:36.127 --> 02:37:37.288]  Yes, I have done voiceovers.
[02:37:39.788 --> 02:37:41.510]  What a wondrous world we live in.
[02:37:41.530 --> 02:37:42.851]  There's just so many opportunities.
[02:37:43.812 --> 02:37:44.973]  Here's the headline.
[02:37:45.013 --> 02:37:48.756]  I'm going to cover it more in a moment after I finish up with the Baltimore News and take calls.
[02:37:49.136 --> 02:37:49.517]  U.S.
[02:37:49.617 --> 02:37:54.661]  lowers fluoride levels in drinking water for first time in over 50 years.
[02:37:54.741 --> 02:37:55.462]  London Guardian.
[02:37:57.304 --> 02:37:59.826]  Oh, another one of our conspiracy theories comes true.
[02:38:00.166 --> 02:38:03.529]  You know what else they did four years ago to be phased in over four years?
[02:38:03.569 --> 02:38:04.009]  Now we're here.
[02:38:05.049 --> 02:38:22.114]  They said, yes, stop using fluoride-based pesticides on plants, because it bioaccumulates, to wait for it, not hundreds of parts per million, but even higher.
[02:38:27.215 --> 02:38:29.576]  They spray it on the grapes and other
[02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:32.642]  Mainly fruits, but some vegetables.
[02:38:33.462 --> 02:38:34.883]  And the buggies die!
[02:38:34.903 --> 02:38:39.167]  Because it's so good for them, that's why there's skull and crossbones on the containers.
[02:38:41.328 --> 02:38:51.316]  The original famous rat poisons were fluoride you would sprinkle out where the rats were walking, or mice, and then they would lick their feet, and you know what would happen?
[02:38:51.676 --> 02:38:53.478]  Bye-bye, cupcake!
[02:38:55.079 --> 02:39:00.263]  Because it's so good for you, that's why the government puts it in the water!
[02:39:02.861 --> 02:39:14.073]  My dad's a dentist, and he was a smart guy, but he went off the propaganda of the big push of the American Dental Association and a big Canadian Dental Association head that got it fluoridated there in the 80s.
[02:39:14.113 --> 02:39:15.875]  That guy went public a few years ago and said it was all wrong.
[02:39:16.256 --> 02:39:20.440]  He goes, I thought it was calcium fluoride, which you do need a small amount of.
[02:39:21.462 --> 02:39:30.146]  He goes, I didn't know it was hydrofluorosilic acid and I didn't know it was shipped in from China and other areas and it was full of hundreds of other chemicals and was given a waiver.
[02:39:30.326 --> 02:39:30.626]  Yes.
[02:39:31.366 --> 02:39:36.829]  We've played newscast here from like ABC News out of Oklahoma and places where they actually went and investigated it.
[02:39:38.569 --> 02:39:41.891]  And they tested one bag from China that was being put, I think it was Tulsa water.
[02:39:41.911 --> 02:39:43.131]  I'm going to pull that up.
[02:39:44.372 --> 02:39:47.153]  And it had 250 something chemicals in it.
[02:39:47.773 --> 02:39:49.234]  Lead, mercury, arsenic.
[02:39:52.344 --> 02:39:56.005]  That's so stupid that we can't even get it out of our water.
[02:39:56.845 --> 02:39:57.365]  But here's the deal.
[02:39:57.725 --> 02:40:06.307]  As big a hoax as this stuff is, once one level of it begins to fall, it all falls.
[02:40:06.667 --> 02:40:10.488]  See, a giant fraud's hard to beat until you start to get holes in it.
[02:40:10.768 --> 02:40:11.988]  Then it collapses fast.
[02:40:12.268 --> 02:40:14.389]  That's why they gotta get everything over on us.
[02:40:15.626 --> 02:40:23.149]  People thought she was nuts back in the 90s when Jocelyn Elders came out and said, you know, help children reach down and masturbate when they're five years old at school.
[02:40:23.389 --> 02:40:24.670]  Have masturbation time.
[02:40:24.950 --> 02:40:26.710]  Set a nap time after lunch for 30 minutes.
[02:40:27.071 --> 02:40:35.014]  You know, and she said, we need to have the teachers reach down and help them, you know, as a creepy lady in an admiral outfit.
[02:40:35.054 --> 02:40:39.916]  That's weirder than L. Ron Hubbard, you know, telling them how to play with their tallywhackers.
[02:40:40.236 --> 02:40:45.178]  I mean, I'm sorry to talk like that, but this is what's going on with these fruits that run things.
[02:40:47.859 --> 02:40:54.383]  And now today, it's mainstream, and they're just in there doing whatever they want.
[02:40:54.403 --> 02:40:55.604]  See, they got us.
[02:40:55.664 --> 02:40:56.865]  They just pushed it and did it.
[02:40:57.145 --> 02:41:03.429]  Just like fluoride, all the scientists came out in the 40s and said, my God, don't put that in the water, it's deadly poison!
[02:41:04.130 --> 02:41:10.314]  Those are crazy people who think the Russians are implanting microchips or radio transmitters in their teeth.
[02:41:10.334 --> 02:41:11.395]  They don't have microchips yet.
[02:41:12.588 --> 02:41:24.454]  And then they would have national shows, just propaganda and sitcoms and dramas and game shows where they'd go, Mrs. Johnson, you don't think there's a chip in your teeth, do you?
[02:41:24.474 --> 02:41:25.495]  Because they'd ask it.
[02:41:25.715 --> 02:41:28.837]  Which of the contestants believes fluoride might be bad for you?
[02:41:28.857 --> 02:41:30.198]  It's part of a Soviet conspiracy.
[02:41:30.218 --> 02:41:33.339]  Of course, it wasn't a Soviet conspiracy, it was a globalist conspiracy.
[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:36.341]  And they'd be like, well, I've done some research and believe it.
[02:41:37.041 --> 02:41:41.904]  Okay, and you think there's, I've seen a clip of this, you think there's a radio transmitter too in there?
[02:41:42.944 --> 02:41:47.908]  And they have laugh signs come on, and the crowd goes, ah!
[02:41:50.009 --> 02:41:54.753]  I've actually had anti-gunners before follow me after a gun rally we were at.
[02:41:55.633 --> 02:42:00.317]  And they followed me into a restaurant and waited while I was eating, and then walked over and went, boo on Alex Jones, boo!
[02:42:00.357 --> 02:42:07.902]  And then pointed and laughed at me, looking around like I gave a rat's behind if people thought I was being ridiculed.
[02:42:08.162 --> 02:42:09.303]  I found it quite entertaining.
[02:42:09.403 --> 02:42:11.505]  I was like, you're making a fool out of yourself.
[02:42:13.221 --> 02:42:14.422]  How you doing, ma'am?
[02:42:14.542 --> 02:42:16.363]  I'd like the salad, no tomatoes, please.
[02:42:16.463 --> 02:42:17.564]  Extra onions and blue cheese, thank you.
[02:42:17.924 --> 02:42:18.424]  Appreciate them.
[02:42:18.544 --> 02:42:19.785]  Iced tea as well, thank you.
[02:42:19.825 --> 02:42:21.646]  And I just said, continue until they throw you out.
[02:42:21.686 --> 02:42:22.146]  I don't care.
[02:42:22.687 --> 02:42:27.169]  But again, in the peer pressure world, they think that gets to someone.
[02:42:28.650 --> 02:42:30.151]  Oh my gosh, you laughed at me!
[02:42:30.591 --> 02:42:31.972]  You called me a racist!
[02:42:32.212 --> 02:42:33.673]  Oh, you have all the power!
[02:42:33.693 --> 02:42:34.574]  I'm so scared!
[02:42:34.594 --> 02:42:38.536]  Alright, I'm sorry, I'm ranting and I've got to get to the next news.
[02:42:40.217 --> 02:42:41.698]  We talk a lot about subliminals.
[02:42:42.879 --> 02:42:48.920]  And a subliminal is just flashing up there a word like dumb or fool.
[02:42:50.620 --> 02:42:57.582]  When they show someone they don't like, they'll just flash up for a millisecond, something your conscious mind can't pick up, but your unconscious does.
[02:42:57.942 --> 02:42:59.202]  And they've got other stuff as well.
[02:43:00.582 --> 02:43:02.483]  But a big one is subliminal audio.
[02:43:02.523 --> 02:43:04.643]  They had that back in the 30s on radio.
[02:43:06.483 --> 02:43:09.124]  And they found little things like
[02:43:10.253 --> 02:43:19.637]  You know, having a ad for car commercials back in the 70s, and then they would run a loop track of a woman going, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh.
[02:43:19.697 --> 02:43:21.237]  See, you're listening right now too, aren't you?
[02:43:21.597 --> 02:43:28.200]  The point is, is that they would run that just subliminal, where you barely can hear it, but you're subconscious.
[02:43:29.264 --> 02:43:30.285]  Could pick up the lowest.
[02:43:30.805 --> 02:43:34.288]  Again, it was audibly being picked up, but your subconscious picked it up.
[02:43:34.548 --> 02:43:36.310]  Kind of like a lot of people can hear dog whistles.
[02:43:36.390 --> 02:43:39.672]  It makes them uncomfortable, but they can't physically, consciously hear it.
[02:43:40.073 --> 02:43:45.197]  But the unconscious brain is connected to areas of the nerves.
[02:43:46.789 --> 02:43:48.730]  that are able to sense it.
[02:43:49.510 --> 02:43:50.271]  So they know this.
[02:43:50.331 --> 02:43:54.413]  But this is near subliminal, because you can hear it when you're conscious if you're awake.
[02:43:54.813 --> 02:44:03.117]  But if you're in a suspended disbelief, sitting there drooling, watching your favorite cop show, and then the AARP show comes on, and it's a woman sitting there knitting...
[02:44:04.096 --> 02:44:05.537]  And they're talking about martial law.
[02:44:05.778 --> 02:44:09.641]  Well, we've boosted the audio, and Paul Joseph Watson has done a report on this.
[02:44:09.981 --> 02:44:11.743]  The video's on Infowars.com.
[02:44:12.043 --> 02:44:21.812]  PSA contains bizarre subliminal message about martial law, commercial for lobby group, conditioning Americans for civil unrest.
[02:44:22.393 --> 02:44:24.395]  AARP's also anti-gun, folks.
[02:44:24.935 --> 02:44:28.417]  But people who are, you know, 56 go, well, it's time for me to go.
[02:44:28.437 --> 02:44:29.478]  I got my free magazine.
[02:44:29.558 --> 02:44:30.439]  I'm part of it now.
[02:44:30.759 --> 02:44:31.920]  It's a free magazine.
[02:44:32.040 --> 02:44:34.461]  I'm going to send them money now and other crap.
[02:44:35.082 --> 02:44:40.485]  And you're just giving money to a group of anti-American piranhas that claim they're there to protect you.
[02:44:40.965 --> 02:44:46.949]  Let's go to the subliminal messaging, which we've boosted the audio to non-subliminal levels.
[02:44:46.989 --> 02:44:47.490]  Stay with us.
[02:44:48.772 --> 02:45:04.801]  A bizarre commercial for insurance company AARP, described as one of the most powerful lobbying organizations in the United States, contains a bizarre subliminal message about martial law being declared in America.
[02:45:05.402 --> 02:45:08.724]  So first I'll play the commercial at normal audio levels.
[02:45:09.324 --> 02:45:19.692]  You'll notice a television news presenter in the background, but you won't be able to quite make out what he's saying, so here's the commercial at normal audio levels.
[02:45:22.274 --> 02:45:25.857]  Woman gets off the chair, she's walking.
[02:45:29.059 --> 02:45:29.960]  Goes in to see her daughter.
[02:45:29.980 --> 02:45:32.362]  It's all about insecurity.
[02:45:33.757 --> 02:45:41.804]  And here's the commercial with the audio levels boosted and a transcript of what is being said by this TV news announcer.
[02:45:43.946 --> 02:45:45.388]  Turn your speaker volume up, folks.
[02:45:59.019 --> 02:46:15.509]  So the obvious question is, why is this subliminal message about martial law being declared by the President after an outbreak, appearing in a public service announcement for caregiving, put out by an insurance company?
[02:46:15.530 --> 02:46:17.110]  Obama has said, Obama was attached.
[02:46:17.131 --> 02:46:20.613]  It has no place whatsoever within the context of the ad.
[02:46:21.213 --> 02:46:22.034]  And think about this.
[02:46:22.734 --> 02:46:29.089]  This had to be specifically created by the company to appear in this PSA.
[02:46:29.550 --> 02:46:32.277]  They couldn't use an actual segment.
[02:46:33.183 --> 02:46:47.468]  from a TV news broadcast, A, because they would be concerned about copyright, and B, because no such news broadcast exists about the President declaring martial law in America after an outbreak.
[02:46:48.169 --> 02:46:56.892]  So they've deliberately put this in, and it's not going to be heard consciously, but it may be picked up subliminally by the viewer.
[02:46:57.779 --> 02:46:59.660]  I mean, what the hell is going on here?
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:00.921]  This is bizarre!
[02:47:01.341 --> 02:47:02.122]  It's everywhere.
[02:47:02.142 --> 02:47:11.889]  And then, of course, we have the involvement of the Ad Council, which is the organization that distributes these PSAs to be broadcast on television and radio.
[02:47:12.809 --> 02:47:18.273]  The Ad Council basically operates as a public relations arm of the U.S.
[02:47:18.333 --> 02:47:18.753]  government.
[02:47:19.334 --> 02:47:26.499]  And according to history professor Robert Griffith, the Ad Council is now so closely tied at the hip with the White House
[02:47:27.503 --> 02:47:34.427]  That it now basically operates as, quote, little more than a domestic propaganda arm of the federal government.
[02:47:35.468 --> 02:47:53.219]  So we have PSAs being put out by one of the most influential lobbying groups in America, supported by the Ad Council, which is now operating as a propaganda arm of the US government, talking about the President declaring martial law in America.
[02:47:54.199 --> 02:47:56.581]  And this is subliminally embedded
[02:47:57.620 --> 02:48:00.404]  Into a commercial about caregiving.
[02:48:01.846 --> 02:48:14.843]  So is it really any wonder that people are so concerned about martial law when this is happening amidst numerous National Guard, police and military drills across the country?
[02:48:16.937 --> 02:48:28.202]  There needs to be a FOIA request and a lawsuit over this, and you will find that just like Media Matters meets Weekly, the Ad Council on Record meets Weekly, this is probably in hundreds of TV shows and ads.
[02:48:28.843 --> 02:48:30.203]  Any government affiliated group.
[02:48:30.583 --> 02:48:38.307]  It's already overtly, we can air a newscast going, Martial Law's coming, you will take for its inoculations, your preachers are government agents, and we will take your guns!
[02:48:38.327 --> 02:48:40.468]  I mean, I can play that newscast if you want.
[02:48:40.488 --> 02:48:42.669]  Then we're like, that's a bad idea.
[02:48:42.949 --> 02:48:44.390]  Shut up, crazy, there's no plan!
[02:48:48.772 --> 02:48:49.573]  This is what they do.
[02:48:49.613 --> 02:48:50.274]  It's a PSYOP.
[02:48:51.235 --> 02:49:05.169]  They're doing it, showing the woman, putting a towel on her five-year-old daughter, the tender love and care so that you're subliminally scared and associate martial law and the president declaring martial law with protecting your child.
[02:49:07.003 --> 02:49:21.826]  It sells the idea, just like they'll cut every time a score is made in basketball or football to troops in the audience, associating pavlovianly that you get a touchdown in a euphoric rush when you are involved in the military.
[02:49:22.906 --> 02:49:26.027]  I mean, folks, you're under total attack.
[02:49:26.507 --> 02:49:28.187]  And we're the opposite of subliminal here.
[02:49:29.767 --> 02:49:33.748]  We're hitting people hardcore, across the head, with the truth.
[02:49:36.633 --> 02:49:38.313]  We wear it openly, nakedly.
[02:49:38.833 --> 02:49:40.354]  We're here about getting you conscious.
[02:49:40.994 --> 02:49:41.774]  Because here's the deal.
[02:49:43.434 --> 02:49:49.355]  You dial up your senses and become aware of the manipulation, then you'll start picking it up everywhere.
[02:49:50.055 --> 02:49:55.156]  And by the way, even if you're a bad person and don't care, you make more money in business, you'll be more aware.
[02:49:56.276 --> 02:49:57.617]  Just turn on, folks.
[02:49:57.657 --> 02:49:59.117]  This show is about turning on.
[02:49:59.357 --> 02:50:00.537]  Turning on your intellect.
[02:50:01.157 --> 02:50:02.438]  Getting to the real world.
[02:50:03.058 --> 02:50:04.238]  Let's go ahead and
[02:50:06.550 --> 02:50:07.891]  That idiot Smith, he stole my line.
[02:50:07.911 --> 02:50:08.311]  I guess he hung up.
[02:50:08.331 --> 02:50:09.872]  I want to go to a break, come back with other people.
[02:50:10.172 --> 02:50:15.556]  Let's finish up with some of Watson's... Some of Watson's... Oh, he's still there?
[02:50:15.576 --> 02:50:16.697]  We'll talk to him briefly after the break.
[02:50:16.957 --> 02:50:18.778]  Let's kind of finish up Watson's report.
[02:50:18.818 --> 02:50:19.098]  Go ahead.
[02:50:19.118 --> 02:50:21.340]  National Guard troops, U.S.
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:27.283]  Army and police, a training for civil unrest and domestic disorder in America.
[02:50:28.244 --> 02:50:35.729]  In anticipation of Jade Helm, the largest nationwide military exercise ever,
[02:50:36.892 --> 02:50:42.034]  During which US troops will operate undetected amongst local populations.
[02:50:43.014 --> 02:50:52.737]  And even those who dismiss conspiracy theories about martial law and civil unrest, you've got to admit that this is really bizarre.
[02:50:53.477 --> 02:50:57.719]  This martial law subliminal has no place within the context of this advert.
[02:50:57.739 --> 02:50:58.679]  It's guaranteed to be everywhere.
[02:50:58.699 --> 02:51:00.519]  It had to have been put in there deliberately.
[02:51:00.579 --> 02:51:01.700]  Notice how people found it though.
[02:51:01.820 --> 02:51:01.880]  Why?
[02:51:02.717 --> 02:51:04.938]  Why is this being put in this PSA commercial?
[02:51:04.958 --> 02:51:05.578]  We're going to break.
[02:51:05.678 --> 02:51:06.558]  For AARP.
[02:51:06.638 --> 02:51:08.139]  Because they're thinking about going live.
[02:51:08.179 --> 02:51:08.959]  Doesn't mean they're going to do it.
[02:51:08.979 --> 02:51:09.659]  We may be able to stop them.
[02:51:09.679 --> 02:51:15.361]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader, My Patriot Supply.

[02:52:17.299 --> 02:52:23.202]  While others stood down, Numana took donations and provided storable foods to the men at Bunkerville.

[02:52:45.069 --> 02:52:48.289]  It felt like I was carrying heavy concrete blocks around my feet and legs.
[02:52:48.729 --> 02:52:51.350]  I started taking Heart and Body Extract as directed.

[02:54:06.426 --> 02:54:20.192]  David Knight's wife was down there with Jakari and Joe Biggs who are going to be in Baltimore tonight, so pray for them.
[02:54:20.952 --> 02:54:23.713]  They're going to have live streams going, nightly news, tomorrow as well.
[02:54:25.794 --> 02:54:32.917]  The site of where the Obama administration is trying to cause a civil war and what Drudge says could bring down America, I agree, that's their plan.
[02:54:34.665 --> 02:54:40.107]  But there were local newscasters there, and I ended up seeing it on the news last night, similar stuff.
[02:54:40.147 --> 02:54:42.107]  I didn't see what he saw, what his wife saw.
[02:54:42.127 --> 02:54:46.609]  And they're like, well, how many people here do you think were for Jade Helm?
[02:54:46.909 --> 02:54:47.869]  They go, oh, it's 50-50.
[02:54:47.949 --> 02:54:51.110]  It was like 99%, 98% against it.
[02:54:51.530 --> 02:54:54.711]  They found two people they talked to out of just everybody that were for it.
[02:54:57.489 --> 02:55:00.432]  But they have the media go, I'm not against the army.
[02:55:00.452 --> 02:55:02.694]  I'm going to lie.
[02:55:03.455 --> 02:55:04.836]  I'm going to be nice to the government.
[02:55:05.337 --> 02:55:07.599]  It's a default with these knuckle draggers.
[02:55:08.140 --> 02:55:09.681]  With these people.
[02:55:10.402 --> 02:55:11.623]  Briefly, you lose.
[02:55:11.683 --> 02:55:12.284]  It doesn't matter.
[02:55:12.544 --> 02:55:16.868]  You may have brain damaged us and hurt us for 50 years, but we're turning the clock back.
[02:55:16.948 --> 02:55:18.030]  We're going to defeat you.
[02:55:18.550 --> 02:55:19.271]  We're turning the tide.
[02:55:20.865 --> 02:55:21.265]  U.S.
[02:55:21.325 --> 02:55:25.088]  lowers fluoride levels in drinking water for the first time in 50 years.
[02:55:25.648 --> 02:55:29.691]  The government is lowering the recommended amount of fluoride added to drinking water for the first time.
[02:55:30.431 --> 02:55:35.234]  Some people are getting too much fluoride because it's also in toothpaste, mouthwash, and the products health officials warn.
[02:55:35.454 --> 02:55:36.355]  That's how they spin it.
[02:55:37.496 --> 02:55:40.137]  And then actually they go into what was really done.
[02:55:40.197 --> 02:55:42.058]  It's because of the brain damage, the cancer, all of it.
[02:55:42.399 --> 02:55:43.459]  They're lowering it by half.
[02:55:44.860 --> 02:55:45.280]  Boom!
[02:55:46.421 --> 02:55:47.562]  And it goes into all of it.

[02:56:08.445 --> 02:56:12.488]  There's no, anybody that says they got filters that cut everything out, it just doesn't work on every compound.
[02:56:13.029 --> 02:56:15.391]  But it reduces it down to where it basically isn't there.

[02:56:47.432 --> 02:56:48.813]  We've got the D3.
[02:56:49.233 --> 02:56:50.854]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:56:52.254 --> 02:56:54.715]  Let's go ahead and jam in a call here.
[02:56:54.775 --> 02:56:56.935]  And I will do overdrive even though I'm going on Ventura Show.
[02:56:57.055 --> 02:56:57.636]  I got time.
[02:56:58.456 --> 02:56:59.296]  Dan in Illinois.
[02:56:59.316 --> 02:56:59.856]  You're on the air.
[02:56:59.876 --> 02:57:00.276]  Go ahead.
[02:57:00.296 --> 02:57:05.318]  Yeah, this is Bible Dan with the Bible in his hand.
[02:57:05.638 --> 02:57:06.278]  All right, buddy.
[02:57:06.318 --> 02:57:07.279]  What's on your mind today?
[02:57:08.879 --> 02:57:11.540]  I got a CERN concern.
[02:57:12.320 --> 02:57:14.541]  I've been watching some YouTube
[02:57:15.470 --> 02:57:24.114]  Video and this one video in particular by BP Earthwatch Rick Peavy?
[02:57:24.514 --> 02:57:24.814]  Yes sir!
[02:57:25.134 --> 02:57:26.735]  I think is his name.
[02:57:27.275 --> 02:57:42.442]  He's got a pretty good video up about CERN beaming neutron beams 800 miles out of Fermilab
[02:57:43.160 --> 02:57:47.982]  To a place in South Dakota, Stanford.
[02:57:49.782 --> 02:57:54.784]  They got an underground, I guess, particle accelerator.
[02:57:54.804 --> 02:57:56.884]  Yeah, that's what CERN is.
[02:57:58.205 --> 02:57:58.505]  Right.
[02:57:58.625 --> 02:58:03.766]  Well, we got these two here in the United States.
[02:58:04.026 --> 02:58:07.888]  There's probably about 300 here, but yeah.
[02:58:07.908 --> 02:58:10.729]  The one in Chicago, they're going to beam these
[02:58:12.822 --> 02:58:18.206]  Neutron beams to South Dakota.
[02:58:20.628 --> 02:58:29.315]  Well, if anything, I think this is going to start the collapse when we have weather
[02:58:30.459 --> 02:58:32.941]  Anomalies and strange earth.
[02:58:33.682 --> 02:58:34.382]  Climate change.
[02:58:34.402 --> 02:58:36.004]  Why are you being racist?
[02:58:36.184 --> 02:58:39.146]  Don't discriminate against volcanoes or earthquakes or tsunamis.
[02:58:39.507 --> 02:58:40.607]  They have a right to kill people.
[02:58:40.627 --> 02:58:41.788]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:58:41.828 --> 02:58:42.469]  No, great point.
[02:58:42.809 --> 02:58:44.110]  CERN is completely out of control.
[02:58:44.130 --> 02:58:45.011]  I'm going to go to Overdrive.
[02:58:45.311 --> 02:58:46.312]  Thank you, Bible Dan.
[02:58:46.632 --> 02:58:49.074]  We'll talk to Jerry and others in 70 seconds in Overdrive.
[02:58:49.375 --> 02:58:50.996]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:51.296 --> 02:58:52.797]  Spread the word about the broadcast, folks.
[02:58:53.118 --> 02:58:54.219]  They want to shut it down.
[02:58:54.879 --> 02:58:55.880]  Don't take it for granted.
[02:58:55.900 --> 02:58:57.281]  It's powerful.
[02:58:57.341 --> 02:58:58.062]  It's hurting them.
[02:58:59.742 --> 02:59:04.743]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:59:04.883 --> 02:59:10.765]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.

[02:59:15.786 --> 02:59:19.107]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[02:59:34.053 --> 02:59:38.016]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[02:59:38.216 --> 02:59:43.000]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[02:59:43.160 --> 02:59:47.683]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[02:59:47.823 --> 02:59:51.146]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:59:51.306 --> 02:59:54.608]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:54.749 --> 02:59:56.570]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:00:02.080 --> 03:00:06.304]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.270 --> 03:00:18.295]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:18.916 --> 03:00:21.899]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:23.780 --> 03:00:26.522]  He shot the video yesterday, but it didn't get a lot of attention.
[03:00:27.042 --> 03:00:29.383]  I'm gonna have it sent back out on Twitter and Facebook.
[03:00:29.763 --> 03:00:32.765]  PSA contains bizarre, subliminal message about martial law.
[03:00:33.285 --> 03:00:34.746]  That's on our Prison Planet Live YouTube site.
[03:00:34.826 --> 03:00:35.446]  It's only got 108,000 views.
[03:00:35.466 --> 03:00:35.987]  106,000 views.
[03:00:36.007 --> 03:00:36.487]  I mean, come on, people.
[03:00:40.287 --> 03:00:41.788]  This needs to have 50 million views.
[03:00:41.808 --> 03:00:44.829]  I know they game the view count and stuff, but man, this is important.
[03:00:46.050 --> 03:00:55.114]  We need to create a whole compilation like McBreen found a video where Sharpie ad shows a protest and the signs say don't protest.
[03:00:55.987 --> 03:00:59.730]  We only see it for like half a second, but your subconscious picks it up.
[03:00:59.790 --> 03:01:01.831]  I mean, we're getting hit hard, folks!
[03:01:02.712 --> 03:01:05.814]  They're preparing for a martial law takeover for a long time.
[03:01:05.874 --> 03:01:11.358]  I don't know if it's today or next week or five years from now, but man, it's exponentially gearing up.
[03:01:13.099 --> 03:01:15.181]  Until we're pretty much just there regardless.
[03:01:15.241 --> 03:01:17.002]  And then people ask, when did it come?
[03:01:17.042 --> 03:01:18.283]  And nobody knows an exact date.
[03:01:18.543 --> 03:01:19.624]  We're just living in a tyranny.
[03:01:23.203 --> 03:01:25.645]  Most people would be happy to have a video in one day with 106,000 views.
[03:01:25.725 --> 03:01:26.445]  I'm not.
[03:01:28.287 --> 03:01:30.508]  Obama deception shouldn't just have 40 million views.
[03:01:30.528 --> 03:01:32.850]  It should have 50, 100 million.
[03:01:32.870 --> 03:01:34.912]  I mean, we need to hit the enemy hard here.
[03:01:35.992 --> 03:01:37.674]  I'm not risking my life to lose.
[03:01:37.694 --> 03:01:40.456]  I want to go 100% up against these scumballs.
[03:01:40.896 --> 03:01:42.797]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jerry in Georgia.
[03:01:42.837 --> 03:01:43.198]  Go ahead.
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:53.447]  Hey Alex, I'm on the Facebook page of the Baltimore Mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, and there are thousands of calls for her resignation.
[03:01:53.467 --> 03:01:58.351]  Yeah, she's a horrible demon who helped the rioters, and now we know she works for Obama.
[03:01:58.411 --> 03:01:58.912]  It's come out.
[03:01:59.212 --> 03:02:00.093]  Kit Daniels wrote about it.
[03:02:00.113 --> 03:02:00.833]  What do you think of her?
[03:02:02.034 --> 03:02:09.561]  Well, I hotlinked your article that just came out about her working with Obama to federalize the police.
[03:02:10.265 --> 03:02:16.982]  But if you go to her posting on April 22nd, she said that she firmly supported body cameras for police.
[03:02:17.742 --> 03:02:25.407]  But if you Google Baltimore Mayor vetoes body cameras for police, she vetoed a bill for body cameras.
[03:02:25.427 --> 03:02:26.848]  I know, everything he says is a lie.
[03:02:27.248 --> 03:02:34.093]  And if they'd have had a body camera that you only turn on during the encounters, something they should always be on because that's Big Brother, then we'd know right away what happened.
[03:02:34.113 --> 03:02:39.596]  We'd either charge the cop or give him a medal, depending on what the truth was, for killing this guy.
[03:02:40.517 --> 03:02:41.497]  Instead, we never know.
[03:02:41.517 --> 03:02:45.380]  And she vetoed it, but she's saying she's for it.
[03:02:46.201 --> 03:02:50.523]  She's a complete liar, but she's being called to resign by thousands right now.
[03:02:51.003 --> 03:02:57.365]  And I just want to encourage people to go on there, comment, or just, if they don't want to comment, at least hotlink one of your articles about her.
[03:02:58.206 --> 03:02:58.966]  Absolutely.
[03:02:59.066 --> 03:03:01.587]  Folks, go to the enemy's Facebooks and Twitters.
[03:03:01.687 --> 03:03:03.848]  Just keep hammering them.
[03:03:03.888 --> 03:03:04.568]  Pick targets.
[03:03:04.968 --> 03:03:06.049]  Hit them with our stories.
[03:03:06.349 --> 03:03:07.529]  Hit them with our videos.
[03:03:07.789 --> 03:03:09.550]  They are already having congressional hearings.
[03:03:10.010 --> 03:03:11.511]  Some of the hearings listing us by name.
[03:03:11.651 --> 03:03:13.372]  They hate our guts because
[03:03:14.412 --> 03:03:16.815]  We are over the target, pounding them.
[03:03:17.455 --> 03:03:18.436]  Thank you so much, Jerry.
[03:03:18.777 --> 03:03:19.718]  And it's not hard.
[03:03:19.898 --> 03:03:20.859]  They're a con game.
[03:03:21.499 --> 03:03:22.981]  We're just calling them on their con.
[03:03:23.021 --> 03:03:24.462]  I mean, there's nothing special.
[03:03:25.283 --> 03:03:26.585]  They're just sacks of filth.
[03:03:27.546 --> 03:03:31.029]  Let's talk to Joshua in California.
[03:03:31.049 --> 03:03:31.550]  You're on the air.
[03:03:31.590 --> 03:03:31.930]  Go ahead.
[03:03:31.970 --> 03:03:32.491]  Last caller.
[03:03:32.511 --> 03:03:33.031]  Sorry, the others.
[03:03:35.193 --> 03:03:35.534]  Hi, Alex.
[03:03:36.308 --> 03:03:43.692]  Hey, tying into Max Keiser earlier, I'm wondering, also you mentioned Obama Deception, what about Obama Deception 2?
[03:03:44.693 --> 03:03:54.799]  And calling these people out, showing them where they are, and maybe getting them to go run and hide in their caves, and pray that they don't see the face of the one that would kill them.
[03:03:56.080 --> 03:03:57.180]  Well, here's what I know.
[03:03:57.360 --> 03:03:59.842]  I can do syndicated radio interviews with other people.
[03:04:01.027 --> 03:04:06.431]  And I can make many documentaries that end up getting seen by more people than, say, a two-hour film.
[03:04:07.492 --> 03:04:14.237]  Yes, if I make it, give it out for free on the Internet, but also sell Blu-rays and stuff, we can make money, which then funds the operation.
[03:04:15.298 --> 03:04:23.184]  But if I can sell other products and fund the operation and then put out more media and reach more people, I do a cost-benefit analysis.
[03:04:25.583 --> 03:04:27.424]  I really should though finish things I started.
[03:04:27.444 --> 03:04:29.486]  I've been working on Obama Deception 2 for five years.
[03:04:29.986 --> 03:04:36.591]  There's been three different films made and dozens, more than dozens, probably 30, 40 powerful interviews that haven't been seen.
[03:04:36.951 --> 03:04:38.792]  We should at least start putting those on the internet.
[03:04:41.274 --> 03:04:42.135]  It's a great question.
[03:04:42.395 --> 03:04:44.676]  I just, you know, I just can't work till 10 at night anymore.
[03:04:45.277 --> 03:04:46.117]  I do it sometimes.
[03:04:46.177 --> 03:04:47.358]  I do coast to coast sometimes.
[03:04:48.199 --> 03:04:49.980]  All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
[03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:50.981]  I'm 41 years old and
[03:04:53.396 --> 03:04:54.936]  I work 10 hours a day and then that's it.
[03:04:55.676 --> 03:04:56.877]  Stick a fork in me and I'm done.
[03:04:57.237 --> 03:05:02.418]  I just... I just... It's too depressing to look at this scum.
[03:05:02.658 --> 03:05:04.858]  I just... That's why I can't stand it.
[03:05:05.078 --> 03:05:18.141]  It's... It's... The globalists are just... As the city of Baltimore struggles to deal with violence and looting, I'm reminded of something the mayor recently said.
