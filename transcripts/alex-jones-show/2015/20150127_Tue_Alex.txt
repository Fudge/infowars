[00:00:01.453 --> 00:00:04.037]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:16.806 --> 00:00:20.988]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:22.449]  You want answers?
[00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:24.110]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.392]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.972 --> 00:00:33.074]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.794 --> 00:00:40.338]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:41.979]  It is already Tuesday.
[00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:43.519]  It's Tuesday.
[00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:49.930]  The 27th day of January 2015.
[00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.531]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:56.955]  We're going to be live here, Lord willing, for the next three hours and we have a jam-packed transmission.
[00:00:58.717 --> 00:01:01.599]  We have a whole bunch of different guests joining us.
[00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:19.971]  We have the man responsible for putting, I guess it's gonna be more than 50 billboards up around the United States the last year promoting Infowars.com and this radio show and that spurred other people who were trying to discover their identities if they want the attention, who are copying him and putting him up as well.
[00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:28.077]  Now hundreds and hundreds of billboards as we speak in almost every city of the United States except where I live.
[00:01:28.857 --> 00:01:35.204]  I've had affiliates before three different times by billboards, but it is strange that they say a prophet is not known in his own country.
[00:01:35.544 --> 00:01:48.417]  I'm not saying I'm a prophet, but the saying certainly goes to that, that when you actually live in a town or a place, people don't take you as seriously as, say, people in other cities, other states, other countries.
[00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:53.143]  Or maybe the listeners just think, hey, he's on the radio, so what?
[00:01:53.163 --> 00:01:54.384]  We don't need to wake anybody else up.
[00:01:54.704 --> 00:01:55.504]  I'm not complaining.
[00:01:55.544 --> 00:01:57.624]  It's just interesting human psychology.
[00:01:57.664 --> 00:01:59.545]  So he's popping in for about 10-15 minutes.
[00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:17.368]  And then we've got Joseph Curl, who, with the good graces and a nice nod from Matt Drudge, created a kind of Republican-style, constitutionalist-style clone of the DrudgeReport.com on the Washington Post.
[00:02:18.727 --> 00:02:21.108]  And, uh, or the Washington Times.
[00:02:21.268 --> 00:02:21.888]  I can't.
[00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:23.049]  A big difference.
[00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:28.891]  And it's called, uh, Write Read, uh, over, uh, at the Washington Times.
[00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:35.514]  And, um, Joe Curl's done a lot of work for Drudge for decades, since it was first around when he was over at the Washington Times.
[00:02:36.034 --> 00:02:40.076]  Uh, so now we've got Joseph Curl from thewashingtontimes.com, which he never left.
[00:02:40.236 --> 00:02:41.736]  He's just focusing on that now.
[00:02:41.757 --> 00:02:45.338]  Uh, joining us to give us his view on Inside the Beltway.
[00:02:45.438 --> 00:02:47.600]  I mean, Joe Curl's been to the White House hundreds of times.
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.781]  He's got all the inside connections.
[00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:53.964]  I don't know if it's hundreds of times, but I know under Bush it was like scores of times.
[00:02:54.745 --> 00:02:57.086]  And he's got a lot of different contacts.
[00:02:57.787 --> 00:03:07.374]  He's there every day, thousands of times, at Capitol Hill and in the Beltway is my main point, over the last 30 years of covering politics.
[00:03:07.414 --> 00:03:11.297]  And he's going to give us his take on where the Republican leadership's really going to go.
[00:03:11.797 --> 00:03:12.458]  John Boehner?
[00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:23.893]  Who will not repeal Obamacare, who will not try to prosecute Obama for any of his Benghazi crimes, or the IRS gate, the NSA gate, the list goes on and on.
[00:03:24.734 --> 00:03:25.215]  He won't
[00:03:26.752 --> 00:03:31.377]  Do anything about the open borders, treasonous policy that's taking place.
[00:03:31.397 --> 00:03:39.787]  We're going to find out from Joe Curl the inside beltway scoop with his ear to the ground on what he thinks is coming in the future and a lot more.
[00:03:39.807 --> 00:03:44.192]  So we'll discuss the political realignment with Joe Curl of rightread.com.
[00:03:47.114 --> 00:03:52.857]  And that is linked up on the WashingtonTimes.com, a subdivision of that.
[00:03:52.897 --> 00:03:58.140]  We'll put it back on screen for all the TV viewers out there.
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.002]  So that's coming up today with Joseph Curl.
[00:04:02.883 --> 00:04:04.984]  And then we've got Leanne McAdoo.
[00:04:06.244 --> 00:04:07.925]  She comes on before Joe Curl joins us.
[00:04:09.146 --> 00:04:10.727]  She's going to be in studio with us.
[00:04:10.747 --> 00:04:12.388]  They've got a worldwide
[00:04:14.616 --> 00:04:16.277]  People from all over the world are coming to it.
[00:04:16.317 --> 00:04:21.281]  An international conference going on here in Austin, Texas on the threat of AI.
[00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:24.484]  And the head of Tesla and others
[00:04:28.723 --> 00:04:31.605]  Are very, very concerned about AI machines taking over.
[00:04:32.426 --> 00:04:41.353]  And Leanne McAdoo was able to interview folks at the conference that's ongoing yesterday with our cameraman, Travis Knight, David Knight's son.
[00:04:41.693 --> 00:04:43.355]  We're gonna get his take on what he saw as well.
[00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:44.475]  We're gonna air some of those clips here.
[00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:46.637]  But a big report tonight on the nightly news.
[00:04:47.017 --> 00:04:50.580]  This is just a preview coming up on this international move.
[00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:52.242]  AI has arrived.
[00:04:53.263 --> 00:04:55.846]  As the Wired Magazine reports.
[00:04:55.866 --> 00:04:57.288]  In fact, we'll put that back on screen.
[00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.694]  AI has arrived and that really worries the world's brightest minds.
[00:05:02.034 --> 00:05:04.657]  That's Wired reporting from the conference.
[00:05:04.878 --> 00:05:08.723]  Infowars.com is reporting from the conference as well.
[00:05:09.003 --> 00:05:09.424]  Stay with us.
[00:05:10.683 --> 00:05:17.626]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:06:44.424 --> 00:06:48.387]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:48.707 --> 00:06:50.168]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:50.488 --> 00:06:58.074]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[00:07:10.464 --> 00:07:11.344]  Alex Jones here.
[00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:20.426]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:25.928]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.

[00:08:05.364 --> 00:08:06.545]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:20.254 --> 00:08:23.740]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:26.084]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:55.544 --> 00:09:05.162]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to another live, worldwide, truly independent, hardcore, Liberty Truth-based transmission.
[00:09:06.187 --> 00:09:10.569]  It's always the communist and mainstream media that claims that they speak for the people.
[00:09:11.549 --> 00:09:13.650]  I don't claim to speak for the people.
[00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:31.676]  I claim to speak for my interests, which are to be in an open, free society with checks and balances, a system and a society based and built around defending individual liberty, life, private property, and justice.
[00:09:33.092 --> 00:09:35.674]  And we know historically what works.
[00:09:36.235 --> 00:09:45.704]  We know time and time again that collectivism leads to all-out nightmarish enslavement and ruination.
[00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:50.547]  Again, we have a giant broadcast coming up today.
[00:09:50.607 --> 00:09:54.769]  Leanne McAdoo is at an international conference that's based here in Austin, Texas.
[00:09:54.789 --> 00:09:58.271]  It's being covered by Wired Magazine, the BBC, you name it.
[00:09:58.691 --> 00:10:05.714]  It is the biggest basically anti-AI conference pretty much ever held with top scientists.
[00:10:05.754 --> 00:10:11.037]  There's the headline, AI has arrived and that really worries the world's brightest minds.
[00:10:11.577 --> 00:10:14.238]  And Leanne has been going there the last few days.
[00:10:14.658 --> 00:10:15.959]  She's going back
[00:10:16.899 --> 00:10:24.285]  As well, she's going to be joining us in studio today and has a bunch of the interviews that are going to be airing over the next few days on the nightly news.
[00:10:24.305 --> 00:10:34.272]  But she talked to the author of Artificial Intelligence, the book, of course, that was going to be made into a film by Stanley Kubrick, but was later made into a film after he died mysteriously.
[00:10:34.993 --> 00:10:38.495]  Artificial Intelligence was made into a film by Steven Spielberg.
[00:10:39.096 --> 00:10:41.077]  She talked to the author of AI and others.
[00:10:41.097 --> 00:10:43.799]  She's going to be joining us at the bottom of the second hour.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.501]  Robert Brobe,
[00:10:46.277 --> 00:10:47.477]  He's a true trailblazer.
[00:10:47.497 --> 00:10:53.340]  He's put up scores of huge billboards all over the United States, even though he's not really a rich man.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.521]  We didn't know who he was the last six months.
[00:10:55.541 --> 00:10:56.761]  We just kept hearing about the billboards.
[00:10:57.061 --> 00:10:58.482]  They're all over the country.
[00:10:58.862 --> 00:11:00.102]  And now something interesting happened.
[00:11:00.242 --> 00:11:05.304]  Other people are imitating it, putting up similar billboards in their cities or in the same city.
[00:11:05.565 --> 00:11:08.566]  So a chain reaction is beginning and we need to really
[00:11:09.306 --> 00:11:23.721]  Get the artwork he has and get with our graphics department, as I said about a month ago, and just create the PDF files for Infowars.com and do the work for folks so they can just contact their local billboard company and put them up.
[00:11:23.801 --> 00:11:26.204]  I mean, now the billboard industry has collapsed.
[00:11:27.199 --> 00:11:35.963]  For all intents and purposes, because of the internet taking over, and also because of the fact that the economy is in trouble.
[00:11:36.563 --> 00:11:49.449]  So billboards that would cost $5,000, that are in major cities, off major highways, that hundreds of thousands of people will see a week, you can get those for basically the cost of the graphics.
[00:11:50.329 --> 00:11:51.690]  The cost of the message.
[00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.471]  We're talking $1,000, $2,000, and reach hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:11:57.651 --> 00:12:02.581]  We don't have the capital or the money to do this ourselves nationwide.
[00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:08.271]  But I am, today when I get off air, we're going to make the graphics in the graphics department.
[00:12:08.491 --> 00:12:09.892]  We're going to basically just imitate that one.
[00:12:10.712 --> 00:12:21.157]  And we are, I think it's excellent, and then we are going to create a page on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com where we're going to put different billboards up there.
[00:12:21.597 --> 00:12:23.498]  And you know what, it doesn't just have to be InfoWars.com.
[00:12:23.798 --> 00:12:27.980]  We'll also have some just saying, remember when America was a free country.
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.821]  Restore the Republic.
[00:12:31.141 --> 00:12:31.902]  And then maybe
[00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:34.976]  Well, I don't know who else's site we could link to.
[00:12:34.996 --> 00:12:35.960]  That doesn't really make sense.
[00:12:37.165 --> 00:12:42.149]  Maybe just have George Washington up there and say, remember when we wanted to build a free country?
[00:12:42.449 --> 00:12:43.510]  Doesn't mean we ever had one.
[00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.410]  We just wanted to build one.
[00:12:44.691 --> 00:12:49.354]  And those ideas did build the greatest experiment in liberty we've ever seen.
[00:12:49.554 --> 00:12:52.697]  We never got to the ultimate goal of a perfect utopia of freedom.
[00:12:52.917 --> 00:12:58.381]  But we wrote the book worldwide on what the standards of freedom, success, and prosperity are.
[00:12:58.661 --> 00:13:01.643]  Because out of freedom comes incredible prosperity.
[00:13:02.024 --> 00:13:04.646]  The problem is then great decadence as we, you know,
[00:13:05.578 --> 00:13:07.359]  Constantly worn, and history shows.
[00:13:08.319 --> 00:13:26.029]  Incredible decadence then follows, the corruption moves in, then the tyranny to secure the ill-gotten gains of the insiders who then wage jihad and war and a crusade, choose your word, on any independent wealth or ideas they do not control.
[00:13:26.609 --> 00:13:30.651]  That's the problem with letting hardcore corruption run rampant.
[00:13:32.244 --> 00:13:44.434]  You could have big mega bankers creating $2,000 trillion in fake derivatives and signing us on to it, but then if they catch an 18-year-old drinking a beer on his back porch, he'll be arrested.
[00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:53.341]  The system's all there to throw the book at people that have really done nothing wrong or victimless crimes, but then to exalt the great tyrants.
[00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:55.202]  They say, if you're gonna steal, steal big.
[00:13:56.323 --> 00:13:58.825]  Don't steal $1,000, you'll go to the pen for 20 years.
[00:13:59.186 --> 00:14:01.548]  Steal $5 billion, and they'll make you king.
[00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.831]  And that is really the corruption that we're facing.
[00:14:05.151 --> 00:14:14.397]  Joseph Kurl of the Washington Times has launched a powerful new section on the site, rightread.com.
[00:14:14.637 --> 00:14:18.800]  He formerly, of course, worked for about, I don't know, over a decade with Drudge Report, drudgereport.com.
[00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:24.624]  And the new site he's got has got the blessing of the big man, Matt Drudge.
[00:14:25.024 --> 00:14:32.049]  And so we're going to get Joe Kurl's take, as I said earlier, he just joined us, on will the Republican leadership get away
[00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:40.484]  With the unprecedented betrayal of the Libertarian Tea Party movement that put
[00:14:42.073 --> 00:14:42.673]  We're good to go.
[00:15:04.767 --> 00:15:12.834]  Open borders, fiat gun control, fiat energy policies, Obamacare, it's all just racing forward.
[00:15:13.475 --> 00:15:14.876]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:15:14.896 --> 00:15:22.823]  Shukari Jackson will also pop in with his take on the political realignment halfway into that interview coming up today.
[00:15:24.164 --> 00:15:32.271]  Now, before we go any further here, let me just run through some of the news we're going to be breaking down today.
[00:15:33.715 --> 00:15:42.076]  De Blasio ordered yesterday indefinite street shutdown tonight during the blizzard.
[00:15:42.156 --> 00:15:43.677]  Well, the blizzard didn't really come.
[00:15:43.717 --> 00:15:45.677]  Yeah, it was cold, a lot of snow.
[00:15:46.097 --> 00:15:47.537]  That's always hit the East Coast.
[00:15:48.097 --> 00:15:54.959]  But notice it... First, they said in the New York Times last year that there'd be no more snow in New York because of, quote, global warming, man-made global warming.
[00:15:55.839 --> 00:16:01.440]  Then they said our computer models are so good, it shows we're going to have a giant blizzard, the worst on history, the worst on record.
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:02.740]  And it wasn't that.
[00:16:04.226 --> 00:16:06.588]  Cuomo bans travel in snowy New York.
[00:16:07.068 --> 00:16:10.411]  In your car, you're committing a crime, was the headline.
[00:16:10.431 --> 00:16:12.693]  A statement by the governor.
[00:16:13.133 --> 00:16:17.096]  But here's Paul Watson's article today on Infowars.com.
[00:16:17.856 --> 00:16:20.539]  Forecasters fail on blizzard.
[00:16:21.299 --> 00:16:23.921]  Yet we're supposed to believe 100-year climate models.
[00:16:24.241 --> 00:16:28.505]  Meteorologists apologize for snowmageddon failed predictions.
[00:16:29.736 --> 00:16:32.378]  And here is CBS News basically saying the same thing.
[00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:37.962]  Storm fails to live up to predictions in some areas as National Weather Service meteorologist apologizes.
[00:16:37.982 --> 00:16:41.424]  Hey, weather prediction has gotten better and better.
[00:16:42.065 --> 00:16:45.847]  But, you know, living here in Texas, hey, if you like the weather, it's about to change.
[00:16:45.867 --> 00:16:47.408]  If you don't like the weather, it's about to change.
[00:16:47.789 --> 00:16:50.430]  The only thing that continues to really
[00:16:52.202 --> 00:16:54.062]  Change, obviously, is the change.
[00:16:54.283 --> 00:16:57.383]  That's why saying now it's climate change, oh my gosh, we can't allow it.
[00:16:57.723 --> 00:16:58.964]  Well, there's always climate change.
[00:16:58.984 --> 00:17:00.804]  I mean, this is, this is asinine.
[00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:03.385]  And every time it's hot in the summer, they say it's global warming.
[00:17:03.685 --> 00:17:05.645]  Every time it's cold, they say it's global warming.
[00:17:06.706 --> 00:17:07.866]  It's just a total fraud.
[00:17:09.586 --> 00:17:11.407]  But that's just some of the news on that front.
[00:17:11.467 --> 00:17:13.827]  I've basically already covered that.
[00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:18.188]  But Subway opened after New York City dodges historic blizzard.
[00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:20.749]  Now, continuing here,
[00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:29.034]  Aircraft carrier Stennis has biggest ordnance on load since 2010.
[00:17:29.654 --> 00:17:34.197]  Why engage in such a major weapons loading process now?
[00:17:35.478 --> 00:17:38.620]  And we're talking heavy bombs for what you take out governments with.
[00:17:39.521 --> 00:17:42.843]  Well yeah, they're going to probably have to do that to Syria, maybe even Russia.
[00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:45.445]  You know, here's what I want to talk about after the break.
[00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:52.137]  Elites throughout history think they're invincible, think they're infallible when they have success after success.
[00:17:52.157 --> 00:17:53.379]  Look at Hitler in World War II.
[00:17:53.779 --> 00:17:59.385]  Had four or five successes in Poland and Czechoslovakia and Austria and Danzig and then in...
[00:18:00.689 --> 00:18:11.237]  France has had six victories, and then all he had was defeats from North Africa to Russia, to the Battle of the Blitz, to the Battle of the Bulge.
[00:18:11.798 --> 00:18:14.920]  It was just defeat, defeat, defeat, defeat, defeat.
[00:18:16.281 --> 00:18:29.111]  And these elites, I don't care how fancy their AI prediction computers are, there's still human error in there, and they're endangering the planet according to every major analyst out there.
[00:18:30.302 --> 00:18:31.783]  Who's not on the establishment payroll.
[00:18:32.363 --> 00:18:36.044]  Mainline political professors, mainline history professors, mainline economists.
[00:18:37.165 --> 00:18:49.269]  A former editor, not an editor, the editor of the Wall Street Journal, the father of Reaganomics, just says our government, you know, Brookings Institute, you name it, says our government is completely insane and super dangerous.
[00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:57.993]  Well, I don't need him to tell me that, but the point is, he's an intellectual from the inside and just basically starts laughing on air now.
[00:18:58.093 --> 00:18:58.793]  It's so insane.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:00.920]  U.S.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.601]  troops and mercenaries are battling Russian spitsnats in Ukraine.
[00:19:06.542 --> 00:19:07.902]  It's basically like Texas.
[00:19:08.503 --> 00:19:13.364]  Eastern Ukraine would be like if Mexico tried to retake Texas, and the U.N.
[00:19:13.404 --> 00:19:27.589]  had foreign troops, say from China, backing up the Mexican army, and they'd driven all the way up to the Colorado border, and all the way up to the Indiana border, and all the way up to the Illinois border, and were just blowing everything up.
[00:19:28.703 --> 00:19:30.224]  And then calling the U.S.
[00:19:30.284 --> 00:19:30.725]  tyrants.
[00:19:31.065 --> 00:19:32.767]  I mean, you can call the U.S.
[00:19:32.867 --> 00:19:33.567]  evil if you want.
[00:19:34.168 --> 00:19:35.789]  There were six flags over Texas.
[00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.052]  Mexico couldn't hold anything but a couple of missions.
[00:19:39.813 --> 00:19:45.457]  Spain couldn't hold anything and closed most of their missions before they left Mexico or got overthrown.
[00:19:46.739 --> 00:19:50.222]  So Mexico has pretty much zero claim on Texas.
[00:19:51.659 --> 00:19:56.321]  Western Ukrainians have always been trying to take Eastern Ukraine.
[00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:56.841]  That's Russian.
[00:19:57.161 --> 00:19:58.842]  And the Russians have always been trying to take Western.
[00:19:59.142 --> 00:20:00.003]  Both sides are wrong.
[00:20:00.263 --> 00:20:01.403]  Both sides are killing each other.
[00:20:01.683 --> 00:20:02.564]  Both sides are idiots.
[00:20:03.024 --> 00:20:09.327]  The point is, though, the West is exacerbating that, and George Soros is, to bring the whole place down and start World War III.
[00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:13.990]  What's the best way to keep a secret from somebody?
[00:20:14.491 --> 00:20:18.453]  Well, you give them something that they want so bad that they don't care what you're hiding.
[00:20:18.773 --> 00:20:23.716]  The year is 2007 and 20% of the state of California is employed in real estate.
[00:20:24.036 --> 00:20:29.179]  We live in a capitalistic nation of kings and prey upon the greed of the selfish pawns.
[00:20:29.659 --> 00:20:30.960]  Based on a true story.
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:35.422]  We created the American dream where everybody could qualify for one of these loans.
[00:20:40.393 --> 00:20:43.756]  Worried about getting sick and feeling terrible for days or even weeks?

[00:24:34.066 --> 00:24:35.308]  Central we're here live.
[00:24:35.368 --> 00:24:40.553]  I'm your host Alex Jones and we're back weeknights 7 o'clock Central InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:24:40.933 --> 00:24:43.456]  Then I return live Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:24:43.496 --> 00:24:46.458]  Central with a Sunday abbreviated broadcast.
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:55.007]  Now coming up Obamacare program costs $50,000 per person for every person who gets health insurance under it.
[00:24:56.243 --> 00:24:57.144]  That's the taxpayers.
[00:24:57.164 --> 00:24:59.386]  You talk about a grand scam.
[00:24:59.766 --> 00:25:01.747]  And before, it cost people on average about $4,000 or $5,000.
[00:25:02.228 --> 00:25:04.710]  Now you know why the insurance companies wrote it.
[00:25:06.411 --> 00:25:08.913]  I mean, you talk about a grand screwjob.
[00:25:09.534 --> 00:25:21.824]  Judicial Watch obtained State Department DSCC records and WorldNetDaily breaks them down on the Benghazi attack and calls them the smoking gun, proving that they were engaged in a cover-up.
[00:25:22.605 --> 00:25:29.832]  DEA cameras tracking hundreds of millions of Americans journeys across the US with license plate reading cameras.
[00:25:30.493 --> 00:25:40.843]  I know I told everybody about that 18 years ago, but now it's in the Financial Times and it's now in IT World and the LA Times.
[00:25:40.883 --> 00:25:42.305]  So now it exists!
[00:25:43.717 --> 00:25:46.699]  Just like they now admit your television watches and listens to you in live time.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.182]  And there are cancer viruses added to most major vaccines.
[00:25:50.622 --> 00:25:56.687]  There's nothing funner than having an excruciating death of you or your child from a loving globalist injection.
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.081]  But again, don't be an extremist.
[00:25:59.121 --> 00:26:00.082]  Trust the system.
[00:26:01.063 --> 00:26:01.824]  That's coming up.
[00:26:02.584 --> 00:26:09.210]  We're also going to get into the CIA whistleblower Jeffrey Sterling found guilty on all counts.
[00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:14.394]  Lots of whistleblowers and journalists being sent to prison now in the free country.
[00:26:15.475 --> 00:26:16.336]  So that's coming up.
[00:26:16.896 --> 00:26:18.798]  NASA test Mars helicopter.
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.643]  Report Indiana governor wants to launch state-run news site.
[00:26:25.606 --> 00:26:28.788]  Well, the police is being honest about it, but it's got the left and right upset.
[00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:36.632]  That's a small smattering of the news that we are going to be covering today.
[00:26:37.473 --> 00:26:43.976]  Libyan luxury hotel attacked in the name of intelligence operative who's known CIA.
[00:26:44.316 --> 00:26:45.077]  It's always the same.
[00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:50.080]  It's like the attackers in Paris were working for Amar al-Awlaki.
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:54.223]  At his training base, where the other Patsy's were trained, publicly!
[00:26:54.383 --> 00:27:00.247]  And he is CIA, and does hang out at the Pentagon all the time, and that's in the London Guardian and Associated Press.
[00:27:00.287 --> 00:27:02.188]  I mean, you just can't make that up.
[00:27:02.248 --> 00:27:04.049]  I mean, I'm not the one saying that, if you're a new listener.
[00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:07.172]  Believe me, I can't believe it either, but it's admitted.
[00:27:09.193 --> 00:27:10.894]  Libyan luxury hotel attacked.
[00:27:12.095 --> 00:27:17.537]  Police want cop tracking app banned while they use the very same technology to track the public.
[00:27:17.957 --> 00:27:20.639]  Hey, I'm against tracking the cops and the citizens.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.642]  And the problem is this stuff's already been turned loose, so it's going to roast everybody's bacon.
[00:27:28.543 --> 00:27:30.764]  And there's no pun intended on that one.
[00:27:31.707 --> 00:27:33.207]  It's going to roast everybody's behind.
[00:27:33.628 --> 00:27:48.332]  If we don't get a hold of all this right now and really, as a culture, through the free market, stop financially supporting organizations that are engaged in total surveillance and companies and products that do it, we're done.
[00:27:49.092 --> 00:27:49.432]  We're done.
[00:27:50.199 --> 00:27:53.862]  And that doesn't mean I'm, again, on some high horse and I'm a purist and I have all the answers.
[00:27:54.362 --> 00:27:58.965]  I just know this is a human society wrecking ball.
[00:27:59.466 --> 00:28:06.010]  According to every metric and every expert, no one is even debating that fact that you better get your seatbelt on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:06.531 --> 00:28:13.396]  And for the public that isn't even aware of what time of day it is, they are like lambs to the slaughter.
[00:28:14.176 --> 00:28:16.178]  And there's 7 billion plus people
[00:28:17.754 --> 00:28:29.059]  That in a crisis, not knowing what they're doing are 10,000 times more dangerous than a stampede of cows that can run through your town and kill hundreds of people.
[00:28:29.099 --> 00:28:31.200]  That happened in cases out west.
[00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:36.583]  Cases of stampedes in major cities like Chicago that killed more people than the biggest gun battles.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:42.701]  Cow stampedes causing giant fires that burn down whole towns or cities or part of cities.
[00:28:43.561 --> 00:28:52.324]  When I say there are 10,000 times that humans stampeding are 10,000 more times, how about a nuclear war during a stampede, during a crisis, during a breakdown?
[00:28:52.844 --> 00:29:01.906]  All these TV shows, all these movies, all these apocalypse dystopic films, Road Warrior, you name it, does not even hold a mere candle
[00:29:02.426 --> 00:29:06.689]  To what the real explosion will look like when seven and a half billion people go crazy.
[00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:16.757]  And no amount of AI, no amount of SWAT teams, no amount of poison in the water, no amount of GMO, no amount of Prozac in the water is going to stop this.
[00:29:17.397 --> 00:29:22.902]  Because the system is engineering a controlled collapse, there's a very good chance it's going to get out of hand.
[00:29:23.282 --> 00:29:25.263]  They see the world as unsustainable.
[00:29:26.164 --> 00:29:28.706]  And 7.5 billion people as a dangerous scourge.
[00:29:29.286 --> 00:29:34.670]  And quite frankly, the way the establishments help grease the skids for this, it is incredibly dangerous.
[00:29:36.932 --> 00:29:39.754]  But when you look at the elite who are the worst of the worst running all this,
[00:29:41.377 --> 00:29:42.778]  They have dug their own pit.
[00:29:43.178 --> 00:29:48.822]  And there's an article today about the elite trying to run for the hills everywhere to hide out from the global depression they helped engineer.
[00:29:49.202 --> 00:29:51.724]  Well, you guys said the global depression would bring in your world government.
[00:29:52.124 --> 00:29:54.166]  You said it's going to bring in World Armageddon, probably.
[00:29:54.546 --> 00:29:58.829]  We'll break down the arms buildup against Russia and the threat of World War III straight ahead.
[00:30:00.009 --> 00:30:00.910]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:03.011]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.932 --> 00:30:06.614]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:10.684 --> 00:31:19.369]  Sold out for weeks through the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:29.654]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[00:31:30.195 --> 00:31:36.298]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:31:36.638 --> 00:31:38.299]  Secret 12 is a binary
[00:31:38.579 --> 00:31:39.060]  We're good to go.
[00:31:56.235 --> 00:31:57.436]  Don't take my word for it.

[00:32:14.065 --> 00:32:19.328]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and
[00:32:19.488 --> 00:32:22.071]  Optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:32:22.291 --> 00:32:24.153]  Just one of the key compounds.
[00:32:24.273 --> 00:32:27.317]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.822]  When I grow up, I want to help build a world for my progeny.
[00:33:24.782 --> 00:33:29.805]  We'll build space bases in other galaxies and we'll transcend tyranny.
[00:33:32.226 --> 00:33:36.528]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:33:39.702 --> 00:33:45.730]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:48.554]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:55.794 --> 00:33:57.616]  I want to salute pre-humanity.
[00:33:57.636 --> 00:34:03.601]  I want to salute believing in the beauty of humanity and our ultimate destiny.
[00:34:03.621 --> 00:34:08.505]  I want to salute all those that came before us who believed in real progress.
[00:34:09.226 --> 00:34:22.237]  How dare the neo-eugenicist globalists who wish to create a worldwide dark age of control freak la-la land call themselves progressives.
[00:34:23.378 --> 00:34:30.843]  They are the progression of a filthy, ugly brain tumor on the beautiful mind of God's creation.
[00:34:30.863 --> 00:34:35.987]  Let me talk about the heavy issue right now.
[00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:39.989]  World War III.
[00:34:41.571 --> 00:34:49.356]  I do not believe that the elites controlling the Anglo-American establishment that are the most intelligent and most virulent
[00:34:50.959 --> 00:34:52.879]  Of the three global crime syndicates.
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:57.200]  I do not believe that they want to have a nuclear war.
[00:34:59.641 --> 00:35:20.406]  But history and common sense has shown that though they are the most sophisticated predatory group the world has ever produced, that humanity has ever produced, and that our decadence and our slovenliness has allowed to develop this cancer,
[00:35:25.757 --> 00:35:44.066]  is rationalizing to itself that it has a plan that will end up empowering humanity when clearly their entire bent, their entire bearing, their entire gearing is for destroying peace, destroying liberty, destroying progress.
[00:35:47.728 --> 00:35:54.151]  World government was established by the Rockefellers with the League of Nations after World War I
[00:35:56.567 --> 00:36:00.648]  And was the chrysalis to then form the United Nations and allied groups.
[00:36:01.148 --> 00:36:17.932]  The UN is mainly a diversionary body, so people think it's his ineffectual world government group, while the IMF, World Bank, Ex-Im Bank, and international secret boards, the NAFTA and GATT boards, the Pacific Partnership boards, they're all completely secret on record.
[00:36:18.573 --> 00:36:21.053]  And the New York Times has the headline, it's totally secret, none of your business.
[00:36:21.994 --> 00:36:23.554]  But that it will now tell Congress what to do.
[00:36:25.799 --> 00:36:30.022]  The TPP and the rest of it.
[00:36:32.723 --> 00:36:38.087]  And they just tell the childlike public, oh, that doesn't exist, children, why there's no world government being formed.
[00:36:38.147 --> 00:36:40.648]  And then now they're like, oh, there's a world government, but it wants to help you.
[00:36:41.088 --> 00:36:41.629]  No, it doesn't.
[00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:54.697]  It wants to bomb into the Stone Age the family, the individual, the spark of liberty, because free will gets in the way of the robotic hell world they're building.
[00:36:56.445 --> 00:37:09.349]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a tyranny out of this world, but it's all done by men and women in suits, and it's all secret, and the lapdog media will only tell you that it's secret for your own good, and so that's the end of it.
[00:37:10.169 --> 00:37:14.090]  And then you wonder why we can't repeal open borders that aren't even a law.
[00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:18.672]  You wonder why we can't stop international gun treaties that Obama's now implementing by FIAT.
[00:37:18.992 --> 00:37:21.733]  You wonder why NATO's commanding our military.
[00:37:21.773 --> 00:37:25.814]  You wonder why our own military doesn't want to fight for Al-Qaeda, but is ordered to do so.
[00:37:26.932 --> 00:37:29.674]  It's because we don't run our country anymore.
[00:37:30.194 --> 00:37:37.139]  For all intents and purposes, the Congress is about 90% and counting vestigial.
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:38.920]  Vestigial.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.662]  If you're a new listener, or maybe you don't know what vestigial means,
[00:37:43.407 --> 00:37:48.110]  You ever noticed a dog has what they call a dewclaw up on the side of its leg?
[00:37:49.051 --> 00:37:54.635]  Back from when it had a different type of paw, they believe, where it was more like a hand.
[00:37:55.236 --> 00:37:56.076]  And it's vestigial.
[00:37:56.116 --> 00:37:58.078]  It has no use, but it's up there.
[00:37:58.458 --> 00:38:02.101]  Whales have fingers in their flippers that are vestigial.
[00:38:03.834 --> 00:38:06.376]  Pretty soon, spines will be vestigial in humans.
[00:38:07.496 --> 00:38:08.877]  I'm not even joking about this one.
[00:38:09.238 --> 00:38:13.500]  Sexual organs under the sexless globalist plan will be vestigial.
[00:38:14.121 --> 00:38:20.585]  Sperm are already 87% non-active and basically vestigial in western men.
[00:38:21.826 --> 00:38:28.751]  Doesn't matter if you're black or white, your sperm count's dropping and genetically, each generation, the genitalia are becoming smaller.
[00:38:29.011 --> 00:38:31.853]  We are under biochem attack.
[00:38:33.186 --> 00:38:33.786]  Hope you enjoy it!
[00:38:35.087 --> 00:38:41.229]  The wages of the New World Order is absolute bloody death, slowly carried out on you and your children.
[00:38:41.549 --> 00:38:45.430]  Remember, the globalists like to do these things delicately, lovingly.
[00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:46.750]  They love their work.
[00:38:48.051 --> 00:38:57.474]  But they've run up against Russia, who is incredibly corrupt, incredibly mafia, incredibly primitive, but very intelligent scientifically.
[00:39:00.092 --> 00:39:16.277]  And Russia is being bullied right now, and let's play the clip from, it's been out for days, we played it on the Nightly News on, I guess it was Sunday we had it on the radio, but the clip has been on Infowars.com since Sunday, but I wanted to play it here.
[00:39:16.297 --> 00:39:21.059]  The media said terror attack in Ukrainian city, and what it is is a battle.
[00:39:22.813 --> 00:39:28.401]  Between Western Mercs and Russian Spitznats in traditionally for 500 years an area that was Russia.
[00:39:28.622 --> 00:39:29.924]  It's been taken away from them a bunch.
[00:39:29.944 --> 00:39:30.665]  They fought for it.
[00:39:32.062 --> 00:39:33.383]  I think it's 13 times.
[00:39:33.403 --> 00:39:34.704]  They've had 13 major wars.
[00:39:34.724 --> 00:39:35.765]  They've lost millions.
[00:39:36.185 --> 00:39:38.747]  Russia's lost millions in Crimean wars.
[00:39:39.387 --> 00:39:42.650]  There's been, I think, three wars called Crimean wars.
[00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:47.634]  The Crimean, the first Crimean, what is the Great Crimean, and the, I forget all the names.
[00:39:47.654 --> 00:39:48.554]  You can look it up yourself.
[00:39:48.594 --> 00:39:53.138]  But more than, more than 13 major wars with millions dead.
[00:39:53.898 --> 00:39:55.219]  It'd be like if the U.S.
[00:39:55.279 --> 00:39:58.882]  was a thousand years old and we'd fought 13 wars for Texas.
[00:40:01.834 --> 00:40:03.195]  We've only fought, really, two.
[00:40:04.075 --> 00:40:05.555]  One under Texas, one under the U.S.
[00:40:05.635 --> 00:40:06.356]  against Mexico.
[00:40:07.056 --> 00:40:16.440]  That's why the Marines say, from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, we will fight our country's battles.
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:17.820]  Well, you know what's going on?
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.401]  The U.S.
[00:40:19.481 --> 00:40:20.021]  is in there.
[00:40:20.081 --> 00:40:25.263]  The CIA admitted this last year, almost 12 months ago, back in February.
[00:40:27.708 --> 00:40:33.551]  That yeah, we spent $5 billion over there, and we've got the CIA commanding mercenary teams up against the Russians.
[00:40:34.211 --> 00:40:37.693]  We are fighting Russian spitsnats right now.
[00:40:38.734 --> 00:40:48.739]  Our government, our crazy evil government, is in Russian territory, in land they've had taken from them over and over again, and I'm not pro-Russia or pro-Ukrainian.
[00:40:48.999 --> 00:40:50.479]  I don't have a dog in this fight, I've studied it.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.361]  The Russians have committed ungodly
[00:40:56.141 --> 00:41:00.185]  Barbarous abuses on Western Ukrainians for at least 500 years.
[00:41:01.366 --> 00:41:08.693]  The Western Ukrainians have committed barbarous tyranny and barbarous mass murders against the Russians in the East.
[00:41:09.754 --> 00:41:14.358]  It's because it's two countries, they've been fighting each other forever, it needs to be divided.
[00:41:15.479 --> 00:41:16.039]  It's that simple.
[00:41:16.279 --> 00:41:17.721]  And it's been divided many times in history.
[00:41:19.005 --> 00:41:23.407]  Hitler spilt into Ukraine with the Western Ukrainians and killed millions.
[00:41:24.107 --> 00:41:25.928]  Then the Russians poured in and killed millions.
[00:41:26.008 --> 00:41:27.429]  It just goes back and forth.
[00:41:27.709 --> 00:41:29.870]  They hate each other when they're not marrying each other.
[00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:32.311]  They're genetically almost the same people.
[00:41:32.611 --> 00:41:34.352]  It is so stupid!
[00:41:34.952 --> 00:41:41.995]  Just like George Soros trying to start a war with the police and to start a war, you know, black on white and vice versa.
[00:41:42.395 --> 00:41:43.876]  Yeah, there's beefs on both sides.
[00:41:43.896 --> 00:41:45.516]  Yeah, there's problems with the police.
[00:41:46.017 --> 00:41:46.437]  Yeah!
[00:41:47.017 --> 00:41:51.760]  But when the bad guy wants you to have a civil war with him, just like in Ukraine.
[00:41:52.121 --> 00:41:53.762]  Yeah, the Russians have done bad stuff.
[00:41:53.902 --> 00:41:55.923]  Yeah, the Western Ukrainians have done bad stuff.
[00:41:56.304 --> 00:42:00.326]  But George Soros and the CIA spent five billion.
[00:42:00.687 --> 00:42:02.648]  Can we play the head U.S.
[00:42:02.728 --> 00:42:03.729]  envoy to the EU?
[00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:06.531]  And we can play her saying we spent five billion in Ukraine.
[00:42:06.591 --> 00:42:07.832]  I mean, to do this.
[00:42:07.872 --> 00:42:11.174]  I mean, they bragged that they installed an unelected government.
[00:42:12.594 --> 00:42:23.864]  And now, they're sending armored vehicles, tanks, tens of thousands of US troops on the Polish border, building up right by Ukraine and Russia, saying it's for Russia.
[00:42:24.645 --> 00:42:29.008]  NATO generals that look so soft and weak, going, we're ready for war with the Russians.
[00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:32.091]  You don't talk like that even during the Cold War!
[00:42:32.692 --> 00:42:35.254]  You don't shoot your mouth off about nuclear war!
[00:42:35.774 --> 00:42:36.955]  The Russians aren't doing it!
[00:42:36.975 --> 00:42:39.378]  Do you understand?
[00:42:40.435 --> 00:42:42.936]  You understand, you soft, fake pieces of garbage?
[00:42:44.657 --> 00:42:46.858]  The point is, is that there are U.S.
[00:42:46.958 --> 00:42:47.819]  mercs and U.S.
[00:42:47.859 --> 00:42:57.064]  troops dying, just like when they launched an attack on Russian-held areas in Ossetia and Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, in 2008.
[00:42:57.564 --> 00:42:59.845]  And then the news announced Russia attacked
[00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:03.451]  Georgia, no they didn't!
[00:43:04.071 --> 00:43:05.152]  It's just not true!
[00:43:05.412 --> 00:43:10.215]  Just like Obamacare didn't let you keep your doctor and didn't cut your bill in half, it doubled it or tripled it!
[00:43:12.477 --> 00:43:14.118]  Raising the debt limit raises the debt limit!
[00:43:14.438 --> 00:43:15.118]  2 plus 2 equals 4!
[00:43:15.719 --> 00:43:17.640]  I don't care what CNN says!
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:18.721]  I'm sick of it!
[00:43:18.941 --> 00:43:20.021]  And you should be sick of it!
[00:43:20.402 --> 00:43:22.123]  It's not hard to figure this out, folks!
[00:43:23.834 --> 00:43:24.294]  Go ahead.
[00:43:24.714 --> 00:43:26.555]  How do you say the name again, CJ?
[00:43:26.575 --> 00:43:27.235]  I keep forgetting.
[00:43:27.255 --> 00:43:28.135]  I don't have it in front of me.
[00:43:28.215 --> 00:43:29.636]  Of the city where these battles are happening.
[00:43:29.816 --> 00:43:32.196]  And our media calls it terror attacks when the Russians fight back.
[00:43:32.216 --> 00:43:32.877]  What were you saying?
[00:43:34.397 --> 00:43:35.017]  Maryupol.
[00:43:35.037 --> 00:43:35.157]  Yeah.
[00:43:35.377 --> 00:43:36.878]  This is a clip from Maryupol.
[00:43:37.178 --> 00:43:39.898]  The guy has what sounds like kind of a New York accent.
[00:43:42.139 --> 00:43:44.940]  And they run up to him talking to him in Russian.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:48.341]  I guess it's Ukrainian.
[00:43:49.714 --> 00:43:51.856]  And the guy's like, get out of my face, get out of my face.
[00:43:52.497 --> 00:43:53.718]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[00:44:03.126 --> 00:44:07.109]  Out of my face, out of my face, please.
[00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:10.372]  Out of my face, out of my face.
[00:44:10.532 --> 00:44:11.212]  What's that sound like?
[00:44:11.653 --> 00:44:13.074]  I'm not an expert on East Coast accents.
[00:44:13.094 --> 00:44:13.975]  There's no sounds East Coast.
[00:44:15.126 --> 00:44:16.247]  Let's see what the crew thinks.
[00:44:16.727 --> 00:44:22.692]  CJ, Joe, Bowne, Nico... Let's roll that clip again.
[00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:26.336]  Yeah, let's roll that clip from the beginning for radio listeners again.
[00:44:26.696 --> 00:44:29.058]  On my face, please.
[00:44:42.873 --> 00:44:44.033]  Yeah, that's Northeastern.
[00:44:44.453 --> 00:44:45.554]  That's a Yank accent.
[00:44:45.734 --> 00:44:45.934]  Yep.
[00:44:46.834 --> 00:44:49.135]  Oh, and people are so politically correct when you say Yank.
[00:44:49.815 --> 00:44:52.475]  It's usually Southerners that go, don't insult the Yankees.
[00:44:53.136 --> 00:44:55.136]  The Yankees are a great name.
[00:44:55.176 --> 00:44:56.696]  That's what the British troops called them.
[00:44:56.716 --> 00:44:58.337]  It was an insult, so they adopted it.
[00:44:58.897 --> 00:45:04.018]  Yankee Doodle Dandy means somebody dressed up in a fancy suit who's gay, basically.
[00:45:04.638 --> 00:45:06.579]  That's what a Yankee Doodle Dandy was.
[00:45:06.639 --> 00:45:08.719]  They were calling you, as they said, you know what?
[00:45:08.759 --> 00:45:10.880]  We are Yankee Doodles, and we're going to kick your butt.
[00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:13.331]  We're Yankee Doodle Dandies.
[00:45:14.751 --> 00:45:15.151]  I love it.
[00:45:15.571 --> 00:45:16.812]  That's what I do when people attack me.
[00:45:16.872 --> 00:45:18.112]  I just adopt all their attacks.
[00:45:18.172 --> 00:45:18.573]  I love it.
[00:45:19.993 --> 00:45:22.014]  So, this is what's going on.
[00:45:22.034 --> 00:45:24.195]  This could cause World War III.
[00:45:24.515 --> 00:45:29.737]  You got the aircraft carrier, the Stennis, getting loaded with the biggest ordnance load since 2010.
[00:45:31.297 --> 00:45:37.560]  Jason Engelman, G-5 Division, leading Chief Petty Officer, said the biggest ordnance on load we've ever seen.
[00:45:39.107 --> 00:45:41.929]  From the Stennis blog, people say, what's your source?
[00:45:42.209 --> 00:45:45.531]  The Aircraft Carriers News Division.
[00:45:46.251 --> 00:45:52.715]  Nearly two weeks ago, we were surprised to read the Navy's website that one of America's prized aircraft carriers, CVN-74 John C. Stennis,
[00:45:55.333 --> 00:46:15.485]  This crew is perhaps best known for following an awkward incident as part of an operational training period in preparation for future deployments, just underwent not only its first ordnance on load since O-10, but according to Senior Chief Aviation Ordnance Jason Engelman of G-5 Division, leading Chief Petty Officer, the biggest ordnance on load we've ever seen.
[00:46:16.426 --> 00:46:19.128]  And they won't say where it's going or what it's for.
[00:46:20.643 --> 00:46:21.564]  Here's the next headline.
[00:46:21.644 --> 00:46:22.785]  Infowars.com.
[00:46:22.905 --> 00:46:23.805]  Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:46:24.506 --> 00:46:25.807]  Russia in the crosshairs.
[00:46:26.107 --> 00:46:30.910]  Washington's attack on Russia has moved beyond the boundary of the absurd into the realm of insanity.
[00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:32.351]  And it is a scary article.
[00:46:32.972 --> 00:46:37.215]  And they're talking about banning RT off American cable and satellite.
[00:46:38.035 --> 00:46:41.098]  Now, folks, when they start doing that, you know we're in trouble.
[00:46:42.359 --> 00:46:48.403]  And, I mean, RT is pretty lapdog towards... I mean, RT America, I'm too hardcore for it.
[00:46:49.684 --> 00:46:53.145]  In fact, I was told that they were basically threatened by the White House to keep me off.
[00:46:53.986 --> 00:46:55.546]  And I was told that by the people at RT.
[00:46:55.586 --> 00:46:57.567]  You notice I'm never on RT, which I don't care.
[00:46:57.807 --> 00:46:59.368]  Not that big an audience, RT America.
[00:47:01.848 --> 00:47:11.312]  It's a badge of honor that I was on there every week exposing the New World Order, exposing what was going on just from a libertarian, human position.
[00:47:12.401 --> 00:47:19.246]  Because the people that have hijacked our country are destroying America, destroying our borders, killing our sovereignty, bankrupting us by design.
[00:47:19.267 --> 00:47:26.152]  And they're always the ones that have these CIA-run bloggers, people that admittedly work for the CIA, come out and attack me and go, Jones is a Russian spy!
[00:47:26.512 --> 00:47:26.773]  Really?
[00:47:26.793 --> 00:47:28.814]  I thought I was an Al-Qaeda spy.
[00:47:29.054 --> 00:47:29.915]  Let me tell you who I am.
[00:47:30.816 --> 00:47:34.839]  Both sides of my family, which hardly nobody can say, I'm not bragging, on the Mayflower.
[00:47:35.039 --> 00:47:37.101]  And the government's got my genealogy, they know that.
[00:47:38.769 --> 00:47:40.212]  1776 in the heart of it.
[00:47:40.252 --> 00:47:41.414]  I'm not even gonna get into my lineage.
[00:47:41.875 --> 00:47:46.063]  Texas Revolution literally on my mother's side started it.
[00:47:47.602 --> 00:47:49.904]  You know, the meetings with Andrew Jackson, all of it, okay?
[00:47:50.344 --> 00:47:52.185]  My family started Texas.
[00:47:52.645 --> 00:47:55.187]  I'm Texas royalty, if you want to get into obnoxious terms like that.
[00:47:55.447 --> 00:47:59.810]  So you traitors, claiming I'm a Ruski agent, say it to my face and I'll break your nose.
[00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.671]  I'm sick of it.
[00:48:00.931 --> 00:48:15.441]  I will stomp your head in the ground, you traitorous maggots, while we go under Obamacare, North American Union, conquered by European banks, announcing our kids don't belong to us, total bondage, total surveillance, and you want to shoot your mouth off about me being a Ruski agent.
[00:48:15.681 --> 00:48:17.402]  I will stomp your head in the ground.
[00:48:18.022 --> 00:48:20.404]  You traitorous little un-American maggot!
[00:48:20.945 --> 00:48:26.709]  I wish you'd go back to the days, I'm telling you, of you just getting my satisfaction out in the street.
[00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:30.613]  You pick a sword or something else, but you're going out in the street with me.
[00:48:31.013 --> 00:48:32.975]  I'm not kidding, you cowardly scum!
[00:48:33.415 --> 00:48:34.756]  I am sick of people like you!
[00:48:35.597 --> 00:48:37.098]  And I'm not going to sit here and take it!
[00:48:38.979 --> 00:48:42.943]  While the New World Order bankers are going to sit off in the middle of nowhere when they start World War III.
[00:48:42.963 --> 00:48:44.084]  They're out of control!
[00:48:45.405 --> 00:48:45.785]  Excuse me.
[00:48:48.177 --> 00:48:50.698]  I'm going to settle down for just a minute.
[00:48:50.778 --> 00:48:51.699]  Hold on.
[00:48:51.939 --> 00:48:52.919]  I'm just going to stop now.
[00:48:52.939 --> 00:48:54.740]  I've got a lot of other news, a bunch of guys coming up.
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:55.540]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:49:00.242]  All right, before we go any further, we're talking about state-run media.
[00:49:00.262 --> 00:49:03.764]  Indiana Governor Mike Pence launched a state-run news site.
[00:49:03.944 --> 00:49:04.924]  They're all attacking him.
[00:49:05.165 --> 00:49:05.305]  What?
[00:49:05.345 --> 00:49:07.446]  He's just doing out in the open what's already going on.
[00:49:09.146 --> 00:49:09.987]  So that's coming up.
[00:49:10.167 --> 00:49:11.587]  The feds just want their own monopoly.
[00:49:11.647 --> 00:49:12.468]  I'm not endorsing it.
[00:49:12.488 --> 00:49:14.128]  I'm just saying it's the least of our problems.
[00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:18.812]  Before we go any further, we got a bunch of specials.
[00:49:18.832 --> 00:49:20.894]  Some of the biggest of the year so far.
[00:49:21.094 --> 00:49:23.836]  Some of the biggest even count last year that end in three or four days.
[00:49:24.476 --> 00:49:25.257]  They will all end.

[00:49:38.606 --> 00:49:40.708]  Then free shipping, that's a huge deal on a water filter.
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.061]  We drop ship within one day.
[00:49:43.081 --> 00:49:45.543]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:49:45.823 --> 00:49:48.465]  We have tests side by side with leading competitors.
[00:49:48.485 --> 00:49:49.346]  There's just no comparison.
[00:49:49.606 --> 00:49:55.710]  We have the studies, the tests, all the talk-ins, the facts begin at InfoWarsStore.com about who has the best gravity-fed filters.
[00:49:55.751 --> 00:49:56.271]  It's right there.
[00:49:56.291 --> 00:49:59.653]  A whole bunch of other more affordable systems, shower filters.

[00:50:04.537 --> 00:50:05.558]  That ends in a couple days.
[00:50:06.119 --> 00:50:19.356]  We've also got another special that ends with the end of the month, and that is 1495 Introductory on the Super Immune Booster, Ancient Defense, Herbal Immunity Defense, the strongest, most concentrated known herbs,
[00:50:19.756 --> 00:50:22.218]  and extracts that are known to help the body boost its immunity.
[00:50:22.538 --> 00:50:24.720]  And it's a very low price because these are not expensive herbs.
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.122]  When you get them, we just had them concentrated.
[00:50:27.362 --> 00:50:28.483]  So very affordable.
[00:50:28.563 --> 00:50:28.863]  Normally $19.95.
[00:50:28.963 --> 00:50:29.644]  Introductory offer $14.95.

[00:50:35.128 --> 00:50:36.669]  And we're going to end this month
[00:50:49.119 --> 00:50:51.681]  Basically half off on a yearly membership for the Nightly News.

[00:52:10.835 --> 00:52:11.595]  Hey, Boomer!
[00:52:11.835 --> 00:52:15.158]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[00:52:15.278 --> 00:52:16.859]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[00:52:16.939 --> 00:52:18.700]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:52:18.901 --> 00:52:24.405]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:52:24.745 --> 00:52:25.485]  I know, right?
[00:52:25.586 --> 00:52:26.526]  You love it, too!

[00:53:09.229 --> 00:53:14.192]  Did you know by age 50, half of all men have an enlarged prostate?
[00:53:14.612 --> 00:53:21.117]  This means more urges to urinate, longer bathroom trips, waking at night to urinate, or issues with sex.
[00:53:21.577 --> 00:53:28.702]  If this sounds familiar, call us now, because we're shipping free bottles of Super Beta Prostate to listeners of this station.

[00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:59.170]  Don't wait.
[00:53:59.571 --> 00:54:00.231]  Just call 1-800-852-1820.
[00:54:00.311 --> 00:54:00.571]  That's 1-800-852-1820.
[00:54:00.611 --> 00:54:00.791]  Call 1-800-852-1820.
[00:54:34.331 --> 00:54:40.619]  And I could talk like this all the time, like most radio broadcasters try to do, but I don't.
[00:54:40.859 --> 00:54:42.841]  I just jabber in my Texas dialect.
[00:54:44.042 --> 00:54:44.782]  Now I really talk.
[00:54:45.442 --> 00:54:47.043]  But when I get serious, I do talk like that.
[00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:50.464]  So it's real when I'm really focused, but half the time I'm not.
[00:54:51.464 --> 00:54:58.507]  Ladies and gentlemen, Leanne McAdoo is going to be joining us in about 40 minutes to break down the big AI international conference taking place in Austin.
[00:54:59.227 --> 00:55:07.390]  And she has convinced me, and she's right, that if I'm on TV in this big fancy studio, that I should wear some makeup to cover up my sunspots and stuff.
[00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:09.171]  And I'm just not used to it.
[00:55:09.231 --> 00:55:14.313]  I just wiped my eyes earlier, and my eyes are watering, so I'm not crying on air.
[00:55:15.113 --> 00:55:17.194]  I just have makeup in this eye over here.
[00:55:17.734 --> 00:55:20.115]  So maybe somebody can get me a wipe or something during the next break.
[00:55:20.615 --> 00:55:21.075]  Help me!
[00:55:21.275 --> 00:55:22.296]  Makeup's in my eye!
[00:55:22.356 --> 00:55:22.996]  I'm so tough!
[00:55:24.708 --> 00:55:26.529]  I'll stomp your button around!
[00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:28.610]  All right, let's get serious here.
[00:55:30.692 --> 00:55:37.396]  Within a matter of minutes, Rob Rieger and the other great graphics people, who we should have on the air sometime, they're great patriots,
[00:55:39.036 --> 00:55:45.640]  Came up with these new billboard ideas for folks to adopt a billboard in your town for the InfoWars.
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:48.322]  2 plus 2 equals 4, InfoWars.com.
[00:55:48.682 --> 00:55:51.784]  Just gets people thinking what genius stuff they came up with.
[00:55:51.824 --> 00:55:56.407]  And we'll give folks a document cam shot of this for the TV viewers.
[00:55:56.927 --> 00:56:00.029]  I'll describe it for the radio listeners.
[00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:04.552]  2 plus 2 equals 4, InfoWars.com.
[00:56:04.912 --> 00:56:06.493]  Disobey, InfoWars.com.
[00:56:09.119 --> 00:56:09.720]  Get mad.
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:11.101]  Infowars.com.
[00:56:11.482 --> 00:56:12.803]  Land of the free.
[00:56:13.184 --> 00:56:13.824]  Crossed out.
[00:56:13.844 --> 00:56:15.606]  Might as well put a red line through it.
[00:56:16.067 --> 00:56:18.329]  People love billboards where you can't read it exactly.
[00:56:18.350 --> 00:56:19.611]  That's a little trick to get folks to read it.
[00:56:19.951 --> 00:56:20.992]  Infowars.com.
[00:56:21.033 --> 00:56:21.833]  These are all excellent.
[00:56:22.434 --> 00:56:23.195]  Snap out of it.
[00:56:23.235 --> 00:56:24.196]  Forbidden information.
[00:56:24.557 --> 00:56:28.020]  Infowars.com with my noggin up there yelling.
[00:56:29.264 --> 00:56:30.686]  Breaking the lies and disinformation.
[00:56:30.706 --> 00:56:31.747]  Infowars.com.
[00:56:32.128 --> 00:56:34.631]  Bad government has grown out of too much government.
[00:56:34.731 --> 00:56:36.434]  Infowars.com with Thomas Jefferson.
[00:56:36.954 --> 00:56:37.976]  Infowars.com.
[00:56:37.996 --> 00:56:39.578]  There's a war on for your mind.
[00:56:40.319 --> 00:56:41.260]  Those are all excellent.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:42.221]  Gotfreedom.
[00:56:42.281 --> 00:56:43.042]  Infowars.com.
[00:56:44.284 --> 00:56:46.566]  Resist Tyranny, InfoWars.com.
[00:56:47.387 --> 00:56:49.488]  Legalize Freedom, InfoWars.com.
[00:56:49.909 --> 00:56:51.610]  Remember when we wanted to build a free country?
[00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:53.011]  InfoWars.com.
[00:56:53.371 --> 00:56:54.913]  This is what they came up with.
[00:56:55.493 --> 00:56:55.893]  You know what?
[00:56:56.094 --> 00:56:56.694]  I know what we're doing.
[00:56:57.034 --> 00:56:59.977]  We're having a $5,000 contest to draw attention to this.
[00:56:59.997 --> 00:57:08.103]  We're going to build a little part of the website right now that has the PDFs of what we've come up with and a PDF of what our next guest has come up with.
[00:57:08.123 --> 00:57:10.485]  We're going to spend a few minutes with, put billboards up all over the country.
[00:57:10.845 --> 00:57:11.946]  So I think these are excellent.
[00:57:11.986 --> 00:57:13.408]  I think his still might even be better.
[00:57:14.258 --> 00:57:15.418]  But this is what they came up with in minutes.
[00:57:15.859 --> 00:57:30.923]  We'll have a $5,000 contest on whoever comes up with the best billboard graphic, but also then puts it in the size of handbills, posts it in legal and lawful areas, or hands it out, videotapes it, and puts it on YouTube.
[00:57:31.263 --> 00:57:32.484]  So we'll get all the great art.
[00:57:33.652 --> 00:57:34.652]  Get people involved.
[00:57:35.193 --> 00:57:38.474]  Have a prize to give attention to those activities.
[00:57:38.674 --> 00:57:40.055]  But everybody wins the InfoWars.
[00:57:40.295 --> 00:57:45.137]  We'll create all these viral YouTube videos of people handing out simple slogans that promote freedom.
[00:57:45.837 --> 00:57:48.198]  That's how the French Resistance started bringing down the Nazis.
[00:57:48.838 --> 00:58:02.604]  And it'll really anger the establishment and become a focal point on the show to spur our millions of listeners, who a lot of them have money, doctors, lawyers, business owners, to put up a billboard in the town with a freedom message promoting InfoWars.com.
[00:58:02.824 --> 00:58:03.364]  But let me tell you,
[00:58:03.644 --> 00:58:08.329]  Create your own blog, put a few stories up there, or your own video, and you put one up.
[00:58:08.509 --> 00:58:09.591]  Just do it!
[00:58:10.612 --> 00:58:12.214]  Do it, do it, do it!
[00:58:12.314 --> 00:58:13.115]  Just fight!
[00:58:13.996 --> 00:58:16.879]  Believe me, if something like this caught on, we could use the First Amendment.
[00:58:18.427 --> 00:58:19.908]  Billboards are super cheap right now.
[00:58:19.968 --> 00:58:23.691]  You can get them in Austin for like $2,000-$3,000 on I-35.
[00:58:23.771 --> 00:58:27.914]  You can get them in small towns for like $500-$600 with simple black paint.
[00:58:28.135 --> 00:58:33.279]  You don't spend too much on the art, because most of them are bare, and people really pay attention to them.
[00:58:33.799 --> 00:58:35.040]  We've done billboards before.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.961]  It had a huge effect, but I just don't have the money.
[00:58:37.722 --> 00:58:39.823]  So we're going to launch this initiative.
[00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:40.983]  We're going to develop it.
[00:58:41.003 --> 00:58:44.285]  We'll announce the details of the contest by next week.
[00:58:44.345 --> 00:58:46.246]  But don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[00:58:46.286 --> 00:58:47.306]  Go to the sound of the guns.
[00:58:47.526 --> 00:58:49.047]  The info war is now!
[00:58:49.427 --> 00:58:50.428]  Tons of news coming up.
[00:58:50.688 --> 00:58:52.048]  We've got four guests today.
[00:58:52.068 --> 00:58:55.850]  Leanne McAdoo, Katari Jackson, Joe Curl, and us.
[00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:57.891]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:00.623 --> 00:59:09.170]  What disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time?
[00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:16.136]  NASA has already set the countdown timer, and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[00:59:16.656 --> 00:59:20.079]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[00:59:20.119 --> 00:59:21.320]  population could perish.
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:24.782]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[00:59:25.242 --> 00:59:27.024]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[00:59:27.484 --> 00:59:28.765]  Mass riots will follow.
[00:59:29.125 --> 00:59:30.846]  Ancient diseases will reemerge.
[00:59:31.327 --> 00:59:34.829]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?
[00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:41.074]  Go to darkestdays.info to find out proven methods of protecting yourself, your loved ones,
[00:59:41.334 --> 00:59:42.455]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:16.755 --> 01:00:20.939]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:21.599 --> 01:00:22.400]  You want answers?
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:24.081]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:24.722 --> 01:00:28.345]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:33.029]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:40.275]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number two.
[01:00:40.295 --> 01:00:43.978]  Joseph Pearl joins us with Jakari Jackson in the second half.
[01:00:45.296 --> 01:00:47.518]  A big insider when it comes to the Beltway.
[01:00:48.338 --> 01:00:50.580]  Patriot, constitutionalist, Joe Curl.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.121]  Works for the Washington Times, has his own section.
[01:00:53.141 --> 01:00:56.083]  Of course, also works for Matt Drudge, DrudgeReport.com.
[01:00:58.772 --> 01:01:01.996]  Another guest coming on who's involved in hardcore activism and having a huge effect.
[01:01:02.016 --> 01:01:03.738]  He pops in for about one or two segments.
[01:01:04.859 --> 01:01:05.940]  That's Robert Bowe.
[01:01:06.581 --> 01:01:15.271]  And then we've also got Leanne McAdoo who's been following the big AI conference here in Austin with serious warnings from these top experts and scientists.
[01:01:15.932 --> 01:01:18.094]  She's going to be spending time with us.
[01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:30.425]  Discussing how humans can engineer a future, an architecture of computers that empowers us, instead of bad humans, the elite, engineering it with autonomous killer drones.
[01:01:30.485 --> 01:01:34.449]  In fact guys, print me articles, they got stuff like five years ago about Britain's
[01:01:36.519 --> 01:01:37.300]  Tyranny drone?
[01:01:37.421 --> 01:01:41.127]  But then they go, oh, it's a Gaelic word for strength.
[01:01:42.108 --> 01:01:43.130]  No, it's called tyranny.
[01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:43.911]  It's just spelled different.
[01:01:43.931 --> 01:01:44.572]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:01:44.873 --> 01:01:49.621]  A big giant B-2 bomber style killer drone called tyranny.
[01:01:53.103 --> 01:01:54.244]  Or is it tyrannous?
[01:01:54.424 --> 01:01:55.125]  It's ridiculous.
[01:01:55.165 --> 01:02:00.671]  It's like the Latin word, but it's tyranny or tyrannous, and they go, oh no, it's a Gaelic word meaning strength.
[01:02:00.871 --> 01:02:03.113]  It's such a sick joke how they flaunt it on our face.
[01:02:03.373 --> 01:02:06.516]  And then we got articles like two years ago about the Pentagon already launching autonomous drones.
[01:02:06.536 --> 01:02:14.164]  I just want to have those when I get to this stack, just to back up what we're going to say when she joins us.
[01:02:16.283 --> 01:02:25.931]  In other news, if you go up to InfoWars.com, I'm still trying to get used to this new studio, you can see Paul Joseph Watson's article.
[01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:30.955]  And I know you guys might have brought this into me, but I just can't seem to find it.
[01:02:31.155 --> 01:02:32.336]  If you'd print it for me.
[01:02:33.136 --> 01:02:41.983]  The article by Steve Watson, Police Want Cop Tracking App Banned While They Use Technology To Monitor You.
[01:02:43.191 --> 01:02:46.194]  And there's a video that breaks this down.
[01:02:46.594 --> 01:02:49.597]  That ties into something I'm going to cover with Curl when he joins us.
[01:02:50.077 --> 01:02:54.661]  DEA cameras tracking hundreds of millions of car journeys across the U.S.
[01:02:55.042 --> 01:03:00.066]  Oh, it started out just on the border, of course, but now it's all over the country with the license plate readers.
[01:03:01.147 --> 01:03:09.014]  We're keeping a database of everything you've ever done, but then having it in the database where federal, state, and police plates aren't read.
[01:03:09.824 --> 01:03:10.845]  There's a no-read function.
[01:03:10.865 --> 01:03:12.587]  See, a two-tier civilization.
[01:03:12.947 --> 01:03:19.134]  And you know I'm not anti-police, but I'm anti them being turned into an authoritarian, above-the-law group.
[01:03:19.154 --> 01:03:20.115]  That's the globalist plan.
[01:03:20.615 --> 01:03:23.098]  Here is a clip, the Whiz app promo.
[01:03:23.158 --> 01:03:26.041]  Police want cop-tracking app banned.
[01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:28.263]  Here is the promo for the Whiz app.
[01:03:28.563 --> 01:03:28.904]  Here it is.
[01:03:30.137 --> 01:03:33.399]  Then we'll continue with the news.
[01:03:33.439 --> 01:03:33.799]  Welcome!
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.501]  You just became a Wazer.
[01:03:35.941 --> 01:03:38.082]  That means you're never alone on the road anymore.
[01:03:38.623 --> 01:03:50.130]  That's because you're now connected to the largest community of drivers on the planet who share real-time traffic information and live road alerts to help everyone bypass traffic, save time and gas money on their commute.
[01:03:50.711 --> 01:03:52.632]  So, just drive with the Waze app open.
[01:03:52.972 --> 01:03:56.774]  And you're already contributing a ton of traffic info that helps your fellow drivers.
[01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:59.996]  You can also actively report events you see while driving.
[01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:01.677]  All hands free, of course.
[01:04:02.337 --> 01:04:08.681]  Waze's big brain rounds up all the real-time info shared by the community and gives you the fastest route to your destination.
[01:04:09.081 --> 01:04:09.581]  Every time.
[01:04:09.862 --> 01:04:11.903]  Even rerouting you midway if there's a better route.
[01:04:12.463 --> 01:04:16.385]  Waze learns the routes you prefer to frequent destinations, and factors them in too.
[01:04:17.046 --> 01:04:24.270]  Connect to Facebook to meet up, arrange pickups, and see a live status of your friends and colleagues arriving to an event or shared destination.
[01:04:24.851 --> 01:04:27.172]  Even Waze's maps update in real time.
[01:04:27.612 --> 01:04:29.554]  The community keeps them ever improving.
[01:04:30.194 --> 01:04:32.417]  Hey, you can get involved in map editing too.
[01:04:33.138 --> 01:04:35.380]  The bigger your community, the better Waze gets.
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:35.801]  Alright.
[01:04:35.981 --> 01:04:37.623]  So, spread the word.
[01:04:37.703 --> 01:04:45.192]  Sounds like a great thing, and when I said this is a thing that cuts both ways, can hurt the police, general public, you name it, I'm all for the app, I think I'll get it.
[01:04:46.314 --> 01:04:48.175]  But believe me, they're going to let the app go forward.
[01:04:48.235 --> 01:04:49.196]  A, it's the First Amendment.
[01:04:49.236 --> 01:04:56.801]  But more importantly, for the establishment, this is a huge HUMET community that the establishment will be able to use.
[01:04:56.841 --> 01:05:03.266]  And then they'll start having editors who will block out, believe it, key stuff that unfolds on the app in real time.
[01:05:04.186 --> 01:05:06.468]  So we're not being given this technology for nothing.
[01:05:07.368 --> 01:05:09.470]  But it is 2.0 of flashing your lights.
[01:05:10.851 --> 01:05:14.352]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:14.492 --> 01:05:18.453]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:18.773 --> 01:05:20.233]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:20.553 --> 01:05:28.135]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:28.415 --> 01:05:29.255]  But for how long?
[01:05:29.555 --> 01:05:35.816]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:05:36.196 --> 01:05:38.997]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:05:40.342 --> 01:05:43.544]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:05:43.844 --> 01:05:51.848]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:05:52.088 --> 01:05:57.110]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:59.812]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:06:00.032 --> 01:06:01.833]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:06:12.778 --> 01:06:16.920]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.301]  Security alert.
[01:06:18.501 --> 01:06:20.262]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:06:20.502 --> 01:06:24.064]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independent media operations.
[01:06:24.084 --> 01:06:26.985]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we
[01:06:27.005 --> 01:06:29.026]  We are the ones responsible.
[01:06:29.086 --> 01:06:30.027]  Prime Directive.
[01:06:30.107 --> 01:06:31.508]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:06:31.648 --> 01:06:34.430]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:37.572]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:06:37.752 --> 01:06:39.993]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:06:40.053 --> 01:06:41.574]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:06:41.594 --> 01:06:43.956]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:06:44.416 --> 01:06:46.097]  They are never going to stop.
[01:06:46.357 --> 01:06:50.300]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:53.222]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:54.022 --> 01:07:02.986]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out!
[01:07:03.066 --> 01:07:05.887]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it!
[01:07:09.915 --> 01:07:16.859]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.
[01:07:17.119 --> 01:07:26.544]  At InfoWars Life, our mission is to bring you the highest quality, purest, cleanest, effective colloidal silver on the market today for the lowest price available.
[01:07:26.744 --> 01:07:34.769]  You don't have to be a doctor to know the fall and winter months are the most dangerous time of year in North America when it comes to you and your family's health.
[01:07:35.009 --> 01:07:44.454]  Infowarslife.com is very excited to announce our biggest run yet of silver bullet colloidal silver exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:44.654 --> 01:07:51.458]  Now Infowarslife.com has taken colloidal silver to the next level using a cutting-edge technique that is free of toxic artificial additives.
[01:07:51.778 --> 01:07:56.740]  Now more than ever, it's important to stock up on high-quality Silver Bullet from Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:59.782]  No survival chest is complete without Silver Bullet.

[01:08:07.726 --> 01:08:08.606]  Silver Bullet.
[01:08:13.108 --> 01:08:15.289]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:15.869 --> 01:08:18.691]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:49.332 --> 01:08:51.373]  Catching my breath running back in the studio.
[01:08:51.433 --> 01:09:00.860]  I was feverishly during that three-minute break getting ready for the new operation we're going to launch to promote freedom all over the United States and show people their real power.
[01:09:02.481 --> 01:09:11.768]  And that is our plan modeled after one of our listeners to put up billboards all over the country that listeners decide to sponsor in their area.
[01:09:12.408 --> 01:09:13.949]  Billboards are incredibly inexpensive.
[01:09:13.969 --> 01:09:17.372]  The billboard market has been collapsed for at least five years.
[01:09:18.092 --> 01:09:21.815]  You can just basically pay for the artwork and get your billboard up.
[01:09:22.315 --> 01:09:32.323]  We're even going to put data on Infowars.com on this page we're going to build in the next week that shows you prices you should be paying by region so that it's easy and quick to get the billboards paid for.
[01:09:32.883 --> 01:09:36.646]  You just call, give them the money, send them the artwork, and it's up for a month.
[01:09:37.186 --> 01:09:41.670]  And a lot of times they get busy, and then if nobody's paid for a new one, they'll just leave it up.
[01:09:42.608 --> 01:09:44.991]  We've had billboards that have been up for six months before.
[01:09:45.371 --> 01:09:58.267]  One time I paid for one in Austin about, I don't know, eight, nine years ago and it was up for six months because no one else had bought the billboard on South Lamar that has got to have hundreds of thousands of people a day driving on it.
[01:10:00.435 --> 01:10:05.639]  I mean, it's one of the most busy thoroughfares, let's just say 50,000 a day to be conservative, that would have seen it.
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:06.700]  Simply amazing.
[01:10:06.961 --> 01:10:09.763]  I'm not going to sit here and self-promote the operation.
[01:10:09.783 --> 01:10:14.207]  I'm going to get into a bunch of news coming up, but this is the power.
[01:10:14.847 --> 01:10:28.138]  The French resistance basically undermined the Nazis to where they easily fell once the Allies moved into France by handing out pamphlets, hanging up signs, criticizing the Fuhrer, letting folks know that it was a tyranny.
[01:10:29.335 --> 01:10:33.740]  Simple activism like that scares the system big time.
[01:10:34.758 --> 01:10:38.420]  So it's important for all of you to have your own YouTube, your own Facebook.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.261]  Use the globalist platforms.
[01:10:40.621 --> 01:10:43.162]  There's a reason they censor folks on YouTube and Facebook.
[01:10:43.462 --> 01:10:51.346]  There's a reason the system doesn't want libertarian, constitutionalist, freedom-based, Americana, pro-family type ideas out there.
[01:10:51.547 --> 01:10:57.530]  There's a reason the Democratic Party is trying to make conservatism and libertarianism and being a veteran be illegal.
[01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:58.950]  I mean, they openly say it's terrorist.
[01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:01.952]  The big terror threat is gun owners and veterans and Christians.
[01:11:02.512 --> 01:11:08.783]  There's a reason that Fort Hood last year, they told the troops, you're not allowed to be part of the Tea Party or Evangelical Christian.
[01:11:08.803 --> 01:11:09.825]  We'll court-martial you.
[01:11:10.125 --> 01:11:10.926]  Yes, that really happened.
[01:11:11.728 --> 01:11:16.436]  It's because we're the enemy of the globalists that have taken over the federal government.
[01:11:17.537 --> 01:11:34.150]  We're the people that say no to banker bailouts, no to derivatives, no to totally open borders, no to Obama acting like a dictator, and we want Obamacare repealed, but they won't do it, even though it was written by the insurance companies, their profits are up 47% just in 2014, death panels, the whole nine yards
[01:11:38.971 --> 01:11:47.417]  Both parties at the leadership level are sold out, but the Republican leadership barely hung on with the constitutional freshman that came in, the Tea Party freshman.
[01:11:47.957 --> 01:11:50.759]  One more election like that, they're going to be checkmated.
[01:11:51.239 --> 01:11:51.880]  What will they do?
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:12:05.189]  In my view, watching them, seeing them do it before, the establishment will activate black ops squads, probably foreign corporate mercenaries, to carry out terror attacks in the United States to blind them on the Tea Party.
[01:12:06.035 --> 01:12:08.876]  Now, Democratic memos came out four years ago.
[01:12:09.297 --> 01:12:10.377]  Fox News even covered them.
[01:12:10.437 --> 01:12:10.957]  We covered them.
[01:12:11.558 --> 01:12:19.001]  Say that, don't worry, terror attacks are coming and we're going to blame it on domestic groups and demonize them.
[01:12:19.341 --> 01:12:19.861]  Don't worry.
[01:12:19.901 --> 01:12:21.462]  This is how we're going to get our agenda through.
[01:12:21.802 --> 01:12:22.403]  Don't worry.
[01:12:23.083 --> 01:12:25.664]  You see the Democratic Party being destroyed, being discredited.
[01:12:25.984 --> 01:12:26.985]  We've got a plan.
[01:12:27.305 --> 01:12:28.445]  Terror attacks are coming.
[01:12:28.686 --> 01:12:30.566]  Very thinly veiled.
[01:12:31.567 --> 01:12:33.608]  Extremely, extremely thinly veiled.
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.201]  It's really the oldest trick in the book.
[01:12:37.241 --> 01:12:39.382]  Just frame your opposition for a crime.
[01:12:39.402 --> 01:12:43.124]  You know, you want to get more money for your black dorm?
[01:12:45.666 --> 01:12:48.788]  Just go hang a swastika on your door, burn a cross in the yard.
[01:12:48.848 --> 01:12:55.172]  Turns out almost all of those events, attacks on black dorms or churches in the last 20 years have been fake.
[01:12:56.133 --> 01:13:01.996]  Also turns out most attacks on white women that you always are hearing about, where the black guys carve, you know,
[01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:04.800]  Whitey on their face or whatever.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.261]  Turns out most of those are fake.
[01:13:07.301 --> 01:13:09.902]  Turns out most black women claiming white men raped them.
[01:13:09.922 --> 01:13:10.942]  Remember the whole lacrosse thing?
[01:13:11.343 --> 01:13:12.363]  Turns out those are fake.
[01:13:12.903 --> 01:13:15.664]  It doesn't matter if they're black or they're white or they're whatever.
[01:13:15.744 --> 01:13:16.625]  Cops know this.
[01:13:18.105 --> 01:13:22.407]  Most of the time when a business gets robbed and something valuable really gets taken, it's an inside job.
[01:13:22.768 --> 01:13:23.928]  Let's say half the time it is.
[01:13:24.728 --> 01:13:26.089]  It's either the owner or the employees.
[01:13:26.889 --> 01:13:29.550]  And most of the time they show up and somebody says they've been raped or whatever.
[01:13:29.611 --> 01:13:30.511]  It's made up, folks.
[01:13:30.931 --> 01:13:32.632]  Well, government does that too.
[01:13:33.769 --> 01:13:35.189]  To create a big pity party.
[01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:37.190]  And I'm telling you, look for that to happen.
[01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:43.712]  So, with the censorship, we've had multiple journalists this week and a CIA whistleblower.
[01:13:44.773 --> 01:13:47.373]  One journalist, in fact I'm going to get Leanne's report, we'll play that later.
[01:13:47.393 --> 01:13:48.474]  I've been to play that since Sunday.
[01:13:48.834 --> 01:13:50.394]  Make me play that at the bottom of the hour, guys.
[01:13:50.915 --> 01:13:52.355]  Ahead of Leanne being in studio with us.
[01:13:52.915 --> 01:13:54.536]  I want to intro her playing that report.
[01:13:55.856 --> 01:14:01.358]  Where you retweet on a WikiLeak and you get, what is it, 60 plus months in jail.
[01:14:02.850 --> 01:14:03.731]  I mean, this is happening.
[01:14:03.791 --> 01:14:05.893]  So all of us need to engage in free speech.
[01:14:06.353 --> 01:14:10.336]  All of us need to flood the system with truth to counter their propaganda.
[01:14:11.237 --> 01:14:13.659]  And joining us is a real hero.
[01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:15.101]  He doesn't even really want to come on the show.
[01:14:17.383 --> 01:14:23.107]  But Robert Bowe is a hero, and he's not a rich guy, but he's put up just tons of billboards.
[01:14:23.147 --> 01:14:24.188]  I don't know the exact number.
[01:14:24.769 --> 01:14:30.093]  I just keep hearing about him all over the country, and now other people are sending us photos of other billboards that aren't his.
[01:14:31.001 --> 01:14:33.404]  Some of them are just black and white, say Infowars.com.
[01:14:33.504 --> 01:14:34.465]  Others are complex.
[01:14:35.105 --> 01:14:36.907]  There's huge city murals.
[01:14:38.649 --> 01:14:44.415]  My son told me that his teacher came in and said, I saw a huge mural in New York City with your daddy on it, Infowars.com.
[01:14:44.575 --> 01:14:45.856]  It was like 40 feet tall.
[01:14:47.903 --> 01:14:52.805]  My daughter's friend said, yeah, we were in North Carolina and saw a billboard for InfoWars.com.
[01:14:53.345 --> 01:14:56.266]  I mean, this is happening all over the place, and it's zeitgeist.
[01:14:57.006 --> 01:14:59.067]  If people want freedom, it's unstoppable.
[01:14:59.307 --> 01:15:09.030]  And if InfoWars is that focal point, or Ron Paul is, or DrudgeReport.com, whatever it is, if we're a focal point, then we should maximize that.
[01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:12.231]  And it's dangerous for us to get bigger and more successful.
[01:15:12.311 --> 01:15:15.372]  But I don't want to just do this in half measures.
[01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:20.913]  I don't want to just fight tyranny because it makes me look like a hero and we can become successful because liberty is popular.
[01:15:21.333 --> 01:15:22.894]  I want to really push the system.
[01:15:23.255 --> 01:15:25.076]  I want to really make them uncomfortable.
[01:15:25.737 --> 01:15:26.577]  I don't have a death wish.
[01:15:26.718 --> 01:15:28.679]  I love life so much I'm ready to give it up.
[01:15:29.119 --> 01:15:45.633]  I would never commit suicide but I love life so much and love my children and your children so much who will live together in the future and don't want evil to win and so despise these people that I intend to push them until they crush me or
[01:15:47.801 --> 01:15:53.323]  Or until they back off or we win.
[01:15:54.224 --> 01:15:57.085]  And maybe I'll never become a big enough threat to them to crush me.
[01:15:57.365 --> 01:16:05.368]  They're trying to politically assassinate InfoWars.com and Alex Jones right now, but your prayers, your support have given us a shield of defense against that, so thank you.
[01:16:06.208 --> 01:16:12.170]  So I don't want to be destroyed, but I know if I fly enough missions over enemy territory, I'm gonna get shot down.
[01:16:12.710 --> 01:16:13.751]  And that just goes with territory.
[01:16:14.291 --> 01:16:16.412]  And it's not a curse, it's a blessing.
[01:16:17.751 --> 01:16:24.033]  If I get destroyed in the service to humanity, then I get to measure up to my ancestors.
[01:16:24.933 --> 01:16:26.014]  Or if I'm victorious.
[01:16:27.234 --> 01:16:32.676]  That's almost ignominious, because then you get old, you degenerate, you know, you're not perfect, whatever.
[01:16:32.976 --> 01:16:38.998]  It's better in the service of something so holy to in the end be destroyed.
[01:16:39.318 --> 01:16:43.960]  And I don't want that, but in my spirit, I am ready.
[01:16:44.904 --> 01:16:45.505]  And willing.
[01:16:46.046 --> 01:16:54.776]  They could put a gun to my head and say, deny freedom, deny liberty, or we'll kill you, and I would never do it.
[01:16:54.816 --> 01:16:57.740]  Because it's at the expense of the innocent, the children.
[01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:00.323]  And I am not a person that wants to hurt the innocent.
[01:17:00.343 --> 01:17:01.104]  My soul says no.
[01:17:03.646 --> 01:17:07.848]  Now it's Robert Breaux, B-R-E-A-U-X.
[01:17:08.408 --> 01:17:09.388]  Very interesting fellow.
[01:17:09.448 --> 01:17:11.669]  We really appreciate him coming on.
[01:17:12.649 --> 01:17:14.270]  Sir, how did you get this idea?
[01:17:14.290 --> 01:17:17.511]  We're going to skip this one network break because I kind of held you over.
[01:17:18.832 --> 01:17:19.832]  How did you get this idea?
[01:17:19.912 --> 01:17:20.993]  How did you take action?
[01:17:21.013 --> 01:17:23.754]  And it's having a huge effect.
[01:17:23.794 --> 01:17:24.554]  Break it down for us.
[01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:38.234]  Well, you know, I've been listening to your show for probably three years now, and you've been talking about promoting the show, and you know, it's great for people out there to, you know, tell others.
[01:17:38.294 --> 01:17:41.876]  That's a great thing to do, but I wanted to bring it to the next level.
[01:17:41.996 --> 01:17:47.898]  I wanted to do it on a mass scale, and we had the ability to do that.
[01:17:48.458 --> 01:17:54.900]  So we, I came up with the idea, you know, I think God puts ideas in people's heads,
[01:17:55.635 --> 01:17:57.816]  And I decided to act on them.
[01:17:58.257 --> 01:18:02.459]  And I came up with a very simple, very simple idea.
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:06.342]  It's a it's a good way to promote the show in mass scale.
[01:18:07.382 --> 01:18:12.765]  You know, the billboard just says want the truth, and it has your website and your picture and your name on it.
[01:18:13.086 --> 01:18:16.808]  And I think the billboards really worked real well.
[01:18:17.548 --> 01:18:24.953]  And I'm trying to figure out a way to do more of them now to really wake people up to get to people
[01:18:25.738 --> 01:18:45.075]  Off their butts in this country and realize what we're facing in this country and I'd really like to Get the listeners involved because I know they want to get involved because I am a listener and I want to get involved in this and I think the listeners want to too and I think I have a pretty good idea that would be very
[01:18:48.519 --> 01:18:49.280]  Not at all.
[01:19:03.681 --> 01:19:04.622]  Well, that's what we're going to do.
[01:19:04.662 --> 01:19:05.764]  I mean, there's a multi-track.
[01:19:05.824 --> 01:19:10.209]  We could get people to donate directly to you, because you know how to do it and do it inexpensively.
[01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:12.192]  You've definitely been very effective.
[01:19:12.472 --> 01:19:13.774]  And then you could run an operation.
[01:19:14.074 --> 01:19:20.902]  We could create an open operation with different billboards, and just if people want to go get it and put up one billboard, five billboards, whatever.
[01:19:21.363 --> 01:19:29.750]  But all these nouveau riche people that think they're going to be safe not getting involved and keep their money, we're going to lose everything, our freedom, if we don't stand up.
[01:19:29.811 --> 01:19:36.857]  And I can't think of a better website and radio show and operation to send people to be warned about what's happening.
[01:19:36.877 --> 01:19:38.939]  And I'm telling you, huge effect from the billboards.
[01:19:39.219 --> 01:19:40.220]  How many have you put up?
[01:19:41.547 --> 01:19:53.031]  We did a total of 13 and we did, you know, 4 in Louisiana, 2 in Mississippi, and then I did another 7 in 7 other states.
[01:19:53.091 --> 01:20:01.694]  I did 1 city in 7 other states because I really wanted to broadcast this, you know, with the money that we had.
[01:20:02.724 --> 01:20:11.173]  To do this, I wanted to get it as broad as I possibly could to really wake up people because people can talk about it through, you know, other states and everything else.
[01:20:11.193 --> 01:20:12.234]  Sure, people ask, what is it?
[01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:15.618]  Well, obviously, it took us months to figure out who you were.
[01:20:16.419 --> 01:20:17.540]  How long ago did you start this?
[01:20:18.961 --> 01:20:22.345]  We started probably, I would say, in
[01:20:23.844 --> 01:20:26.346]  Uh, let's see, September, I think we started this.
[01:20:26.607 --> 01:20:29.690]  Okay, so you started back in September, so it's been three or four months.
[01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:32.152]  It took us a couple months to find you.
[01:20:32.513 --> 01:20:34.315]  There's other people doing it now.
[01:20:34.435 --> 01:20:38.219]  We don't know who they are because they're different billboards that are starting to pop up.
[01:20:38.319 --> 01:20:39.300]  That's really exciting.
[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:44.485]  Imagine a chain reaction if our listeners that have the means in every town and city
[01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:56.658]  Put these up, even if it's on the side of your barn, you know, InfoWars.com, or if it's a small billboard, what if everybody started doing this, or people that didn't started printing up handbills and handing them out.
[01:20:56.718 --> 01:20:57.979]  It's just the idea.
[01:20:59.261 --> 01:21:06.068]  Anything could be the focal point, but again, you were the focal point to spur us now, and to spur others, so congratulations.
[01:21:06.735 --> 01:21:07.376]  Well, thank you.
[01:21:07.456 --> 01:21:15.443]  And yeah, just like I was saying, you know, last time, you know, people can order the bumper stickers and order the bumper stickers and put them up everywhere.
[01:21:15.483 --> 01:21:27.374]  I mean, it's really time for the American people in this country to start becoming active because this time right now is, I really think we have two years
[01:21:28.533 --> 01:21:31.095]  Maybe even less than that, to save this country.
[01:21:32.016 --> 01:21:33.297]  I mean, we really need to start doing that.
[01:21:33.377 --> 01:21:33.957]  Absolutely.
[01:21:33.977 --> 01:21:36.319]  I mean, look, they're not going to stop.
[01:21:36.379 --> 01:21:47.207]  If George Soros got caught spending, well he admitted it, $33 million just to destabilize and start a war with the police, imagine what other tricks they've got up their sleeves.
[01:21:47.447 --> 01:21:49.969]  They are moving on every front to start civil unrest.
[01:21:50.529 --> 01:21:59.144]  To get us all fighting with each other, we've got to identify the globalists that are behind all this, the private fellow reserve, before they bring us into the next level of crisis.
[01:21:59.941 --> 01:22:00.441]  Absolutely.
[01:22:00.761 --> 01:22:11.224]  And look, the thing is, is if they want to do this, if they want to blow buildings up, if they want to release viruses, if they want to do, there's nothing we can do to stop that.
[01:22:11.544 --> 01:22:17.926]  The only thing we can do is wake as many people up to what's going on and who's at fault.
[01:22:18.326 --> 01:22:21.126]  That way people know and they don't fall into their trap.
[01:22:21.487 --> 01:22:23.247]  That's, that's really the only thing we can do.
[01:22:23.871 --> 01:22:25.492]  Well, has it been a good experience with you?
[01:22:25.512 --> 01:22:32.277]  I know you're not a guy with a lot of means and you spent a lot of your money on putting up these billboards, but has it been satisfying?
[01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:33.858]  It was very exciting.
[01:22:34.659 --> 01:22:42.104]  I love doing it and I'd like to do more through the donations of other listeners and ideas they have.
[01:22:42.945 --> 01:22:43.966]  It was awesome.
[01:22:44.895 --> 01:22:51.297]  Well, how do people, we didn't talk before air, but I guess we're wargaming this right now, that's how most great things end up happening, is people just take action.
[01:22:51.637 --> 01:22:56.759]  How do people contact you if they wanted to donate, and how much on average is each billboard?
[01:22:56.859 --> 01:22:57.879]  These are huge billboards.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:08.163]  The average price, you know, it depends on your city, but I would say average price is probably around $3,000, $3,500, something like that.
[01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:11.424]  And that's because these are the big jumbos, they have the smaller ones that are about half that.
[01:23:12.233 --> 01:23:15.574]  Yeah, but there's no point in going halfway.
[01:23:16.135 --> 01:23:20.677]  Let's put them up in major cities, major traffic areas.
[01:23:21.117 --> 01:23:22.657]  If you're going to do it, let's do it.
[01:23:23.958 --> 01:23:24.358]  And you know what?
[01:23:24.458 --> 01:23:25.739]  I'm going to prime the pump.
[01:23:25.799 --> 01:23:29.860]  Buckley, I'm doing $5,000 to push this contest, but let's spend...
[01:23:31.890 --> 01:23:32.952]  I got to check the budget.
[01:23:32.972 --> 01:23:35.917]  We don't have a lot of extra capital right now as we just expanded, but you know what?
[01:23:36.077 --> 01:23:36.758]  The money will come in.
[01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:43.429]  Let's put $10,000 down on maybe two billboards in Austin because I know they're more expensive here because it's such a hot city.
[01:23:43.789 --> 01:23:45.692]  Let's try to get one or one big one on I-35.
[01:23:47.114 --> 01:23:47.794]  To get this going.
[01:23:47.814 --> 01:23:49.655]  In fact, in the next month, let's get a billboard up.
[01:23:49.915 --> 01:23:58.979]  And listeners, if you mail in donations and write on there for a billboard, you have my word, 100% of that check will go towards an InfoWars billboard.
[01:23:59.199 --> 01:24:02.960]  You can even specify what town or city you want it in.
[01:24:04.521 --> 01:24:05.181]  I'm not going to wait.
[01:24:05.221 --> 01:24:06.242]  We're just going to start doing it.
[01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:10.383]  How do they contact you, Robert Breaux, if people want to donate to you?
[01:24:12.887 --> 01:24:15.549]  Here's the thing, I haven't set anything up yet.
[01:24:15.649 --> 01:24:16.550]  I know we weren't planning it.
[01:24:16.710 --> 01:24:17.310]  Okay, well that's fine.
[01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:18.391]  Come up with a plan and we'll do it.
[01:24:18.911 --> 01:24:23.234]  Okay, I'll contact you and set up something and we'll get this going.
[01:24:23.815 --> 01:24:24.255]  Absolutely.
[01:24:24.275 --> 01:24:25.036]  Well, that's what it's all about.
[01:24:25.056 --> 01:24:26.556]  I was just sitting there saying, we need to get this guy on.
[01:24:26.576 --> 01:24:26.937]  He's great.
[01:24:26.957 --> 01:24:27.457]  And I went, wait a minute.
[01:24:27.797 --> 01:24:28.838]  Other billboards are going up.
[01:24:28.938 --> 01:24:29.858]  Other murals are going up.
[01:24:30.278 --> 01:24:37.282]  Why don't we just have a contest and get folks to come up with their billboard designs and shoot video of them handing out handbills of the design.
[01:24:37.762 --> 01:24:43.205]  That way you get people on YouTube waking up in cyber war, not just on the ground war, real world war.
[01:24:44.205 --> 01:24:45.006]  I don't think so.
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:05.101]  Absolutely.
[01:25:05.441 --> 01:25:07.002]  I think it's a great idea, man.
[01:25:07.262 --> 01:25:07.583]  I really do.
[01:25:07.943 --> 01:25:20.333]  I think a key is, too, if local cities have the money, if a couple business guys get together and want to put one up, you could have, you know, wake up or learn the truth or any of the things that you're putting on the billboards.
[01:25:21.249 --> 01:25:38.633]  And then the name of the radio station, Alex Jones, on Blah Blah AM or FM, and then the time, and then have Infowars under it, we could kind of have a synergy to also point people locally who aren't online or who don't like to listen online at the local AM and FM affiliates.
[01:25:38.914 --> 01:25:40.354]  That's going to take some legwork, but
[01:25:41.471 --> 01:25:43.592]  If people are in the cities, call the station.
[01:25:43.952 --> 01:25:44.692]  Work with them.
[01:25:44.833 --> 01:25:45.653]  Call the affiliates.
[01:25:45.673 --> 01:25:51.556]  Say, I want to sponsor a billboard for you and Alex Jones to thank you for carrying the show to reach more people.
[01:25:51.816 --> 01:25:53.356]  This is how wars are won.
[01:25:53.476 --> 01:25:55.497]  Getting off the bench, taking action.
[01:25:55.577 --> 01:25:56.158]  I'm nobody.
[01:25:56.398 --> 01:25:57.758]  I've been doing this 20 years, folks.
[01:25:58.099 --> 01:25:58.519]  I've spent...
[01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:02.440]  More than $15 million a year in the last 10 years funding this operation.
[01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:08.322]  Trying to get the products in, sell the high quality products, to make the money to pay for a major news organization.
[01:26:08.862 --> 01:26:10.143]  And this is just the next level.
[01:26:10.443 --> 01:26:16.425]  Again, that's not money I'm making, that's money I'm bringing in to spend, and it's the best money I ever spent in the war.
[01:26:17.085 --> 01:26:18.846]  That's what this is all about.
[01:26:19.006 --> 01:26:20.746]  I love my Ford F-150.
[01:26:21.046 --> 01:26:22.227]  I don't need a Lamborghini.
[01:26:22.987 --> 01:26:27.832]  I mean, I could have had those things as a successful talk show host, but I didn't want them.
[01:26:28.072 --> 01:26:30.875]  I wanted to build a news organization with the money.
[01:26:31.195 --> 01:26:35.159]  And I put it into this as seed money, and it's grown and grown by God's blessing.
[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:40.044]  I'm asking you listeners, even though there's not really a plan yet, to help us with this.
[01:26:40.104 --> 01:26:41.545]  In fact, don't wait for our plan.
[01:26:41.805 --> 01:26:45.069]  Just do what Robert Brough has done and take action.
[01:26:45.269 --> 01:26:46.310]  What do you say to that, Robert?
[01:26:46.909 --> 01:26:48.350]  I think that's a great idea.
[01:26:48.570 --> 01:26:51.691]  You know, we'll set something up and we'll just see how it progresses.
[01:26:52.091 --> 01:26:59.474]  But I really encourage the listeners that if you do have the money, then you should do it.
[01:26:59.814 --> 01:27:02.595]  This is about the future of this country.
[01:27:02.976 --> 01:27:13.480]  I mean, there's no other thing you can do to give you more satisfaction than standing up for your rights and your freedoms and saving this damn country.
[01:27:14.332 --> 01:27:14.972]  Beautifully said.
[01:27:14.992 --> 01:27:16.093]  We've got about three minutes to break.
[01:27:16.153 --> 01:27:16.773]  I've been ranting.
[01:27:16.793 --> 01:27:18.574]  You've got the floor for anything else you'd like to add.
[01:27:18.594 --> 01:27:20.714]  I know you don't even want to be on air, but we appreciate you.
[01:27:21.395 --> 01:27:40.802]  Well, I mean, all I wanted to say, brother, is that, you know, we don't have anything set up yet, but we are going to do that, and we'll contact you about a webmail, maybe even an email address that y'all can send in, ideas on billboards, and see if we can get this started.
[01:27:41.262 --> 01:27:42.903]  But I do want to say one thing, you know,
[01:27:43.810 --> 01:27:48.690]  This guy that had these videos of these people in California that are just totally, uh...
[01:27:49.941 --> 01:27:50.301]  Idiots.
[01:27:50.482 --> 01:27:58.529]  I mean, we don't need to worry about people like that because they're, even if they don't do anything, they're not going to be a force.
[01:27:59.030 --> 01:28:02.252]  They are, we flicked them off with our fingertips.
[01:28:02.673 --> 01:28:03.994]  They are nobody.
[01:28:04.354 --> 01:28:08.839]  So we, the people who are strong in this country need to start standing up.
[01:28:09.079 --> 01:28:13.203]  We don't need to worry about people that they're not going to take our rights ever.
[01:28:13.783 --> 01:28:22.450]  That's right, that's why they fund Al Qaeda, so that our best and brightest that want to defend this country get suckered into going and getting killed, fighting evil groups that our own government helped create.
[01:28:22.811 --> 01:28:26.774]  We need the men of this country to stand up in the info war and be leaders.
[01:28:26.814 --> 01:28:37.323]  And you talk about Mark Dice's video, the DrudgeReport.com link to yesterday that went viral, where he talked to ten people and eight of them said, ban the Bill of Rights, just randomly talked to ten people.
[01:28:37.864 --> 01:28:39.085]  I mean, none of it's edited, folks.
[01:28:39.125 --> 01:28:40.046]  Those are the people he talked to.
[01:28:40.746 --> 01:28:43.529]  And they said, yeah, get rid of all freedom in America for Obama.
[01:28:43.849 --> 01:28:46.291]  I mean, this shows how dangerous these people are.
[01:28:46.311 --> 01:28:49.114]  But you're right, they're total jellyfish if we stand up against them.
[01:28:49.814 --> 01:28:50.395]  Absolutely.
[01:28:50.855 --> 01:28:51.596]  Anything else, brother?
[01:28:51.616 --> 01:28:53.537]  No, sir, man.
[01:28:53.838 --> 01:28:55.199]  We're trying to get this going.
[01:28:55.874 --> 01:28:56.995]  Sure, folks shouldn't wait.
[01:28:57.015 --> 01:28:59.116]  They should put up their own billboards, design their own.
[01:28:59.136 --> 01:29:05.320]  We're going to put up a site in the next few days with some of our ideas, with a copy of your PDF, if you send it to us, of your billboard design.
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:07.281]  We're going to get a P.O.
[01:29:07.321 --> 01:29:14.965]  box for yourself, we'll have you back on, have folks send you donations, if they trust you, which I know they should, you know, to carry that out, and put up some of your own.
[01:29:15.305 --> 01:29:20.308]  That's the answer, is not have one centralized system, but have a bunch of people taking action.
[01:29:20.388 --> 01:29:23.050]  And again, in the first war against the British,
[01:29:23.730 --> 01:29:28.819]  In 1776 they would say, don't wait for orders from headquarters, go to the sound of the guns.
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:30.943]  That's what Pat Buchanan would always say.
[01:29:31.224 --> 01:29:33.387]  Just get in there, take action.
[01:29:33.688 --> 01:29:35.671]  Robert, bro, thank you so much.
[01:29:36.192 --> 01:29:36.892]  Thank you, sir.
[01:29:37.633 --> 01:29:38.674]  Amazing individual.
[01:29:38.754 --> 01:29:39.754]  He's taking action.
[01:29:39.834 --> 01:29:40.795]  He's not a rich man.
[01:29:40.815 --> 01:29:41.676]  Spent everything he had.
[01:29:42.096 --> 01:29:44.678]  Put those billboards up, and it's caused a chain reaction.
[01:29:45.398 --> 01:29:47.840]  And because of the way the world works, we can't even track them all.
[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:49.681]  We just know they're coming in, other billboards.
[01:29:50.101 --> 01:29:51.742]  Want to salute all of you that have done that.

[01:30:00.268 --> 01:30:03.010]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.

[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:44.041]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:31:44.201 --> 01:31:48.163]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:31:48.483 --> 01:31:49.923]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:31:50.263 --> 01:31:57.826]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[01:32:10.222 --> 01:32:18.886]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[01:32:19.206 --> 01:32:29.210]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:32:29.730 --> 01:32:35.813]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:32:36.173 --> 01:32:42.337]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:32:42.577 --> 01:32:45.259]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[01:32:45.639 --> 01:32:50.763]  And adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.

[01:33:42.825 --> 01:33:52.273]  Barrett Brown, a journalist that dare retweet the news of WikiLeaks' release, was just sentenced a few days ago to 63 months in federal prison.
[01:33:53.277 --> 01:34:05.628]  Leanne McAdoo filed a report on this the day it happened, and I just covered it when it took place, but I wanted to get to her report from the Nightly News before she gets into another report that she's going to preview for us.
[01:34:05.688 --> 01:34:15.638]  It's coming up on the Nightly News this evening on an artificial intelligence conference, an international conference taking place in Austin, Texas right now, where all these top experts are saying
[01:34:16.218 --> 01:34:20.521]  Humans need to take control of our destiny and not let the machines take over.
[01:34:20.801 --> 01:34:37.492]  Well, they're being engineered by the globalists on record to be autonomous, like Tyrannus, the BAE Systems, British Air Systems, I'm not joking, that is a stealth autonomous kill robot aircraft.
[01:34:38.317 --> 01:34:39.399]  It's already gone to this.
[01:34:39.419 --> 01:34:40.842]  They're about to get rid of the human operators.
[01:34:40.882 --> 01:34:42.005]  We told you this a long time ago.
[01:34:42.265 --> 01:34:42.967]  It's all been announced.
[01:34:43.247 --> 01:34:44.069]  That's coming up in a moment.
[01:34:44.269 --> 01:34:48.638]  But first, her report on Barrett Brown and the persecution of the press.
[01:35:02.841 --> 01:35:19.791]  Well, if you haven't heard already, political prisoner Barrett Brown was sentenced today to 63 months in prison on trumped-up charges for basically exposing the shady relationship between intelligence contractors and the US government.
[01:35:20.191 --> 01:35:28.016]  Here's Leanne McAdoo to tell us why the Barrett Brown case is vitally important to freedom in America.
[01:35:28.539 --> 01:35:38.944]  American journalist and activist Barrett Brown first landed on the FBI's radar through his journalistic activities with a crowdsourced investigation called Project PM.
[01:35:39.244 --> 01:35:51.290]  Project PM was intended to provide a centralized data set regarding the expanding capabilities of the surveillance state and other issues constituting threats to human rights and the health of democratic institutions.
[01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:57.273]  Brown was originally facing decades of prison time for copying and pasting a link
[01:35:57.833 --> 01:35:59.335]  To a publicly available file.
[01:35:59.976 --> 01:36:04.101]  Journalists shouldn't face prosecution for linking to source material.
[01:36:04.361 --> 01:36:09.027]  So journalists everywhere should be paying very close attention to what happens in Barrett Brown's case.
[01:36:09.367 --> 01:36:14.614]  But not only that, anyone who uses social media should be paying attention as well.
[01:36:15.014 --> 01:36:21.960]  Six months after the March 2012 FBI raid on his mother's home, he tweeted, dead men can't leak stuff.
[01:36:22.441 --> 01:36:28.626]  Illegally shoot the son of a B. Now, of course, upon first glance, that sounds like an incitement to murder.
[01:36:28.926 --> 01:36:34.051]  And indeed, the FBI even claimed that the tweet was targeted toward one of their agents.
[01:36:34.471 --> 01:36:35.292]  But here's the thing.
[01:36:35.612 --> 01:36:40.197]  The tweet was actually a quote of Fox News host Bob Beckel.
[01:36:40.717 --> 01:36:47.962]  Beckle was using his primetime news hour to call for the assassination of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
[01:36:48.442 --> 01:36:50.264]  The way to deal with this is pretty simple.
[01:36:50.584 --> 01:36:51.865]  We got special ops forces.
[01:36:52.365 --> 01:36:54.186]  I mean, a dead man can't leak stuff.
[01:36:54.226 --> 01:36:58.289]  This guy's a traitor, a treasonous, and he has broken every law of the United States.
[01:36:58.569 --> 01:37:04.874]  The guy ought to be... and I'm not for the death penalty, so if I'm not for the death penalty and I don't want to do it, illegally shoot the son of a b****.
[01:37:05.134 --> 01:37:13.699]  The FBI took no action against Bob Beckel or numerous others who were openly calling for a mystery bullet to take out Julian Assange.
[01:37:14.239 --> 01:37:22.644]  Instead, two days after Barrett tweeted the Bob Beckel statement, the FBI arrested not Bob Beckel, but Barrett Brown.
[01:37:23.045 --> 01:37:24.906]  And he's been in jail ever since.
[01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:31.929]  Assange warns social media users of this vulnerability, writing, Twitter is a police interview that never ends.
[01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:34.911]  Facebook has all of your friends wearing a wire.
[01:37:35.251 --> 01:37:38.393]  And YouTube has you in the dock talking to the judge.
[01:37:39.073 --> 01:37:47.338]  Every social media user creates a vast library of statements that may be taken out of context by vengeful or ambitious officials.
[01:37:47.938 --> 01:37:51.400]  Users should be displayed their Miranda rights each time they log on.
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:38:04.276]  Keep this in mind as the Obama administration is pushing for CISPA 2.0, which will effectively allow governments to demand that companies hand over user data without the need for warrants or subpoenas.
[01:38:04.717 --> 01:38:08.682]  With stronger cybersecurity laws will come harsher punishment.
[01:38:12.892 --> 01:38:14.534]  Alex Jones here back live.
[01:38:14.654 --> 01:38:19.179]  InfoWars Nightly News anchor Leanne McAdoo, investigative journalist, joins us.
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:27.929]  Leanne, for those that don't know about Barrett Brown, they just convicted a CIA whistleblower that exposed criminal activity to a big federal prison sentence today.
[01:38:28.890 --> 01:38:31.953]  Barrett Brown linked to a public document
[01:38:32.674 --> 01:38:35.817]  And then quoted a Fox News reporter and now he's in jail.
[01:38:37.198 --> 01:38:44.824]  The White House has a war on journalists and the average journalist won't even get up in arms to defend their own profession in the First Amendment.
[01:38:45.185 --> 01:38:48.688]  There is no common sense out there in the establishment.
[01:38:49.454 --> 01:38:55.022]  Right, well it's just like when we had a lot of people were coming after you saying, oh we should drone him, we should take him out.
[01:38:55.562 --> 01:39:01.791]  Right, they're using their platform of a news hour broadcast to call for your death.
[01:39:01.811 --> 01:39:03.893]  I forgot Fox News said I should be droned or tased.
[01:39:04.394 --> 01:39:08.036]  And that's exactly what they were saying about the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
[01:39:08.116 --> 01:39:10.758]  And I mean, just show after show after show calling.
[01:39:11.098 --> 01:39:16.662]  So all Barrett Brown did was repeat what this Bob Buckle said.
[01:39:17.182 --> 01:39:21.365]  And then that was when they finally just came in about two days later and took him to jail.
[01:39:21.405 --> 01:39:22.566]  And he's in jail.
[01:39:23.266 --> 01:39:26.167]  For 63 months, he'll serve almost the whole Senate federally.
[01:39:26.187 --> 01:39:30.628]  That's hard time, as they call it, for retweeting what a Fox News guy said.
[01:39:30.768 --> 01:39:31.628]  And linking to a document.
[01:39:31.668 --> 01:39:39.670]  Yes, the initial thing that, you know, they got him on the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act because he linked to a publicly available document.
[01:39:39.710 --> 01:39:41.551]  They were building this sort of dossier.
[01:39:42.291 --> 01:39:43.171]  We do that all the time.
[01:39:43.211 --> 01:39:44.371]  What's in it?
[01:39:44.632 --> 01:39:45.412]  What's attached to it?
[01:39:45.432 --> 01:39:47.092]  He didn't even know what was there.
[01:39:47.152 --> 01:39:48.973]  He was just helping with his investigation.
[01:39:50.593 --> 01:39:52.894]  Well, you've got to open files to know what's in them.
[01:40:07.661 --> 01:40:08.262]  I don't know.
[01:40:38.301 --> 01:40:45.263]  Well, I mean, some mainstream news has been calling it tyranny, but if we don't see a bigger backlash, this is going to set the precedent, and it really is frightening.
[01:40:45.784 --> 01:40:53.566]  Yeah, well, and they can just call for your death right on cable news, you know, and primetime news hour call for your death, but that's not an issue.
[01:40:53.706 --> 01:41:01.528]  I forgot when on Piers Morgan they said, yeah, get a gun, shoot him right here in the studio, and they said, yeah, I'd love to kill him, and they all agreed, let's murder him.
[01:41:01.708 --> 01:41:02.169]  Exactly.
[01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:06.290]  And they can say it's a joke, but when you start calling for violence, it crosses the line.
[01:41:08.030 --> 01:41:22.161]  In precedent, federal and state, and in common law, if I would have said, you know, let's shoot Piers Morgan, close quote, I didn't just say that by the way, I said if I was to have said that hypothetically as he said about me, and Buzz Bissinger said, then I would be indicted.
[01:41:22.441 --> 01:41:22.921]  Absolutely.
[01:41:23.241 --> 01:41:31.728]  And that's the issue here, is that cherry-picking how they're going to prosecute, or who they're going to charge, and that's okay because, you know, you're part of the establishment.
[01:41:32.328 --> 01:41:33.768]  Well, look at this report out of Breitbart.
[01:41:33.848 --> 01:41:37.589]  Report, Indiana Governor Mike Pence to launch state-run news site.
[01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:50.933]  The Indianapolis Star is reporting that potential 2016 presidential hopeful Governor Mike Pence, Republican, plans to launch a state-run news site that will offer pre-written articles to Indiana news outlets, as well as sometimes break news stories about his administration.
[01:41:51.253 --> 01:41:53.654]  The White House has already moved to this several years ago.
[01:41:54.830 --> 01:42:04.015]  The reason they can do it is, when the mainstream media regurgitate whole cloth what they're told, you make yourselves obsolete.
[01:42:04.035 --> 01:42:06.956]  That's what the CIA came out a decade ago and rolled it out three years ago.
[01:42:07.416 --> 01:42:09.837]  Computers that write the news and put fake names on.
[01:42:10.378 --> 01:42:18.542]  They just put in the pre-scripted disinfo, it scrambles it to make it look like a human wrote it, they leave it out of typo to make it, they found that makes it look more legitimate.
[01:42:19.502 --> 01:42:22.704]  And they caught the CIA, we'll put a typo in the headline.
[01:42:24.110 --> 01:42:26.071]  For some reason they found makes people buy it more.
[01:42:26.191 --> 01:42:28.132]  I don't understand that they've got the algorithms.
[01:42:28.633 --> 01:42:31.274]  So that's why this is really happening.
[01:42:31.294 --> 01:42:34.756]  But now Republicans and Democrats are up in arms about this.
[01:42:35.377 --> 01:42:35.877]  Why are they?
[01:42:35.957 --> 01:42:41.360]  I mean, I'm not saying it's good, but why are they up in arms when this is what the whole federal government does?
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:43.141]  They just don't want the competition.
[01:42:43.701 --> 01:42:44.182]  Exactly.
[01:42:44.202 --> 01:42:46.323]  Or it's that it's out there in the public now.
[01:42:46.363 --> 01:42:50.986]  But we reported this a year or so ago when they lifted the ban on
[01:42:51.946 --> 01:42:53.907]  Spreading propaganda to the continent.
[01:42:53.947 --> 01:42:55.308]  Well CIA disinformation.
[01:42:55.348 --> 01:42:55.528]  Yeah.
[01:42:55.588 --> 01:43:05.753]  Yeah Allegedly they were only doing it overseas, but now they're openly they can just get us propaganda right here on the news shifting gears You've got like a five-minute clip.
[01:43:05.773 --> 01:43:18.239]  They'll be more on the nightly news tonight that you're gonna be hosting seven o'clock central again Leanne McAdoo here on the info wars.com news studios you've gone to this international conference being held in Austin artificial intelligence open house and
[01:43:18.699 --> 01:43:22.421]  Monday, January 26 at the Hyatt Regency in Austin, Texas.
[01:43:22.441 --> 01:43:25.743]  You're going to be also reporting on some of the break-away, break-off groups.
[01:43:26.323 --> 01:43:30.345]  But you talked to some of the top artificial intelligence professors.
[01:43:30.365 --> 01:43:34.467]  You talked to the author of Artificial Intelligence, the book that was turned into a movie.
[01:43:35.087 --> 01:43:43.411]  You talked to a bunch of other folks about the IBM Watson, you name it, that's deciding which troops to not give health care to now.
[01:43:43.512 --> 01:43:44.832]  That was announced last week.
[01:43:46.913 --> 01:43:54.497]  Give me your take on this, because they're talking about being able to stop the AI anti-human takeover of Tyranus.
[01:43:54.797 --> 01:43:59.180]  That's the BAE system, the aircraft that kills people and makes its own decisions.
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:03.182]  That's what all this is going to, but we still have time to stop it, don't we, Leon?
[01:44:03.402 --> 01:44:29.687]  Absolutely and that was kind of my takeaway from that experience because initially I went there I was thinking I was gonna see you know robo girlfriends and all sort of eye tracking and mosquito drones and yeah I was like I'm gonna get some good stuff on camera and then I go there and it was just like poster boards up on the wall with like here's what we want to do and it was kind of disappointing but then when I I left I realized
[01:44:30.427 --> 01:44:42.990]  That that is actually a great thing, because these systems, this malevolent takeover that science fiction is basically warning us is going to happen, isn't here just yet.
[01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:54.692]  We have the opportunity to really press down and say, we need to be responsible with what we are creating and this technology that we're creating, because it is a part of our human evolution.
[01:44:55.073 --> 01:44:56.453]  You know, that's what humans do.
[01:44:57.673 --> 01:45:04.616]  We supposedly try to control our environment and build the environment we want, not let the establishment build a technocracy that enslaves us.
[01:45:04.636 --> 01:45:05.037]  And you're right.
[01:45:05.537 --> 01:45:09.138]  Japan's trying to go with the RoboSapien robot model.
[01:45:09.198 --> 01:45:18.122]  The Western elite want an artificially intelligent computer to map reality through smart dirt or chips and everything to then control and surveil everything.
[01:45:18.503 --> 01:45:19.163]  That is here.
[01:45:19.643 --> 01:45:26.264]  What's not here is the killer robots on the ground, but we're only a few years away from that and have to have a debate about it.
[01:45:26.744 --> 01:45:28.205]  Tell us about this clip we're about to play.
[01:45:29.245 --> 01:45:32.026]  Well, this clip, I'm speaking with Dr. Stuart Russell.
[01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:40.347]  He wrote the book Artificial Intelligence, A Modern Approach, and we basically were talking about what is the future for humanity?
[01:45:40.467 --> 01:45:42.608]  What happens when the robots take all of the jobs?
[01:45:43.208 --> 01:45:44.108]  Who decides?
[01:45:44.668 --> 01:45:48.631]  Who gets to decide what is positively beneficial to society?
[01:45:48.771 --> 01:45:59.959]  Because a drone, you know, an autonomous drone, it's beneficial to the soldier that's not going to have to die out on the field, but it's not beneficial to perhaps the innocent person who is killed with that drone.
[01:45:59.979 --> 01:46:06.463]  Plus it takes humans out of the equation, and then the robot can just be self-destructed or it's memory wiped after it murders the family.
[01:46:06.643 --> 01:46:08.645]  Right, and we know- And plants DNA there to blame me.
[01:46:09.125 --> 01:46:13.049]  Right, and whoever is programming this drone might just be doing his job.
[01:46:13.390 --> 01:46:14.911]  But who gave you the orders to do that?
[01:46:15.051 --> 01:46:22.399]  And is it a war that was waged for humanity or just for some corporate person who wanted to go in and take this country's resources?
[01:46:22.879 --> 01:46:23.640]  Who decides?
[01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:31.828]  There was a Tom Selleck movie back in the 80s called Runaway and they've now come out with basically killer robots that don't stab you with acid.
[01:46:32.449 --> 01:46:38.391]  They fire a shotgun burst at you, or they have a handgun built inside of them, and it comes in your house and kills you.
[01:46:38.751 --> 01:46:40.192]  DARPA released that two years ago.
[01:46:40.592 --> 01:46:43.613]  They have drones that fly over and release a hundred.
[01:46:43.633 --> 01:46:48.135]  And they actually have these now, little pods that come down and surveil you and shoot you.
[01:46:48.995 --> 01:46:50.476]  I mean, this is really happening.
[01:46:50.676 --> 01:46:53.157]  And believe me, I talked to a Marine Corps colonel
[01:46:54.678 --> 01:46:58.120]  Sixteen years ago, that said, look, the robots you're seeing are nothing.
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:03.842]  But he said, we're not going with the Japanese model, this is back then, of like having something that looks and acts like a human.
[01:47:04.402 --> 01:47:06.663]  It's an 18-wheeler that pulls up that's a robot.
[01:47:07.544 --> 01:47:14.366]  And out of it rolls off a whole bunch of wheeled killer robots that just, it doesn't matter if it takes them five minutes to climb your stairs.
[01:47:14.626 --> 01:47:17.988]  They go in, they blow up your door, they come in and they roll in and they kill you.
[01:47:19.148 --> 01:47:21.450]  And, uh, and then now, of course, they've shown us all that.
[01:47:21.530 --> 01:47:26.933]  I mean, basically, they have things that are like F-150 pickups, but are battle-hardened, that look like a cartoon.
[01:47:26.953 --> 01:47:30.016]  They've got so many guns and weapons on them, and then that's what you're facing.
[01:47:30.236 --> 01:47:30.436]  Right.
[01:47:30.616 --> 01:47:36.680]  It's robot planes, it's robot cars, it's, it's, it's, it's not going to be Homo sapien-looking robots.
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:38.902]  Right, and, and he was actually saying that
[01:47:40.067 --> 01:47:44.129]  It's even more, it's going to be even more frightening than that.
[01:47:44.249 --> 01:47:47.650]  Building this robot army, that doesn't even make sense.
[01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:52.092]  What they would do could take out a country in a day, simply.
[01:47:52.112 --> 01:48:06.417]  Well sure, it's a robot brains that go in and jack into all the communications, or even if they hardwire stuff not to be hooked into the grid, they simply deploy robot drones that are like smart meters that hover in, attach,
[01:48:06.937 --> 01:48:07.277]  I don't know.
[01:48:20.027 --> 01:48:28.872]  Well, I believe he mentions that here at the end, and this is why he's talking about why Elon Musk and these other people are signing this open letter saying we need to be responsible.
[01:48:28.912 --> 01:48:36.856]  We're going to cover it after the break, but talk about some of these articles in that Wired magazine admitting Google's plan at the beginning was to build an AI supercomputer to control reality.
[01:48:37.779 --> 01:48:53.272]  Right, well that's basically what Stuart Russell was talking about as well, is that the AI that we have is like Siri, or like Google, where what it is, is it's kind of taking all this data and figuring out how to be a more perfect source of information.
[01:48:53.312 --> 01:48:55.734]  We are building the AI, it is us.
[01:48:56.194 --> 01:49:03.240]  Exactly, that's how it learns, that's how the robots learn, is they observe us and they see what's beneficial to us.
[01:49:03.381 --> 01:49:05.983]  My God, we're building robots that are like us, we're really in trouble.
[01:49:06.463 --> 01:49:09.046]  Well, I mean, we are, we are programs, you know?
[01:49:09.066 --> 01:49:10.267]  Biological androids, yeah.
[01:49:10.287 --> 01:49:21.699]  Yeah, and that's why we have the ability to observe our environment and say, you know, my tribe is cold, so I'm gonna knit a sweater, or I'm gonna build a fire, or I'm gonna, you know, that's what we do.
[01:49:21.799 --> 01:49:26.003]  We build these things, and so we are creating this AI system
[01:49:26.684 --> 01:49:29.104]  Just like we built InfoWars to fight the New World Order.
[01:49:29.204 --> 01:49:29.945]  Absolutely.
[01:49:30.385 --> 01:49:41.207]  And so that's what it is, is that we can't be afraid of what our human abilities are going to do, but we also cannot stand down and let, you know, John Connor build the Terminator.
[01:49:41.247 --> 01:49:49.048]  We have to fight exactly to build a free and open system and take it away from the technocrats that are just telling us the way it's going to be, and that's what this conference was about.
[01:49:49.248 --> 01:49:49.888]  Exactly.
[01:49:49.968 --> 01:49:51.368]  Because it doesn't exist yet.
[01:49:51.649 --> 01:49:53.549]  They just want us to believe that
[01:49:54.589 --> 01:49:55.770]  That's how you control reality.
[01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:58.571]  They tell us this is what it is and then we just accept it.
[01:49:58.671 --> 01:50:03.954]  First they deny it's happening so we're not involved in changing how they build it for the good.
[01:50:03.974 --> 01:50:05.835]  Now they just say, oh this is the way it is.
[01:50:06.096 --> 01:50:07.376]  Humans are obsolete, you're over.
[01:50:07.656 --> 01:50:08.637]  That's what the Borgs say.
[01:50:08.997 --> 01:50:11.539]  You're obsolete, you will be assimilated, submit now.
[01:50:11.879 --> 01:50:12.119]  No!
[01:50:12.539 --> 01:50:15.941]  We're not going to just surrender because Tokyo Rose said it was over.
[01:50:16.201 --> 01:50:24.007]  Right, imagine if people had listened to you 20 years ago when you were talking to them about surveillance and being spied on through your lights and this and that.
[01:50:24.067 --> 01:50:31.132]  Imagine if people had gave a darn 20 years ago, this NSA surveillance program wouldn't have gotten to where it is now.
[01:50:31.532 --> 01:50:39.638]  But it's just a year or so ago that, oh, it's out in the open, it's everywhere, and now they're actually selling it to you as the Internet of Things, as this great thing.
[01:50:39.698 --> 01:50:40.619]  Yeah, it is.
[01:50:40.899 --> 01:50:45.002]  We are spying on you everywhere and you just, it's smart of you to get it.
[01:50:45.302 --> 01:50:48.383]  Lianne McAdoo, another one of the amazing reporters.

[01:54:38.976 --> 01:54:40.821]  Here's part of our interview with Dr. Stuart Russell.
[01:54:42.165 --> 01:54:46.357]  We're gonna go ahead and roll that and we'll come back in the next segment and finish the interview.
[01:54:53.618 --> 01:55:06.548]  So speaking about dispelling the myth of this AI explosion and robots are going to, you know, destroy humanity and that's kind of a way that media and science fiction can sell, you know, sell their product.
[01:55:07.068 --> 01:55:20.379]  But we do have people like Stephen Hawking or Elon Musk saying that, you know, there is a reason for concern and Elon Musk donates a lot of money to this research where they're going to put forth this effort to make sure AI doesn't get ahead of us.
[01:55:21.079 --> 01:55:24.260]  Is there a reason to be concerned, and what can we do about it?
[01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:41.025]  So, there is a reason to be concerned in the long term, because the direction that AI has been going, and not just AI, control theory, operations research, there are other disciplines aimed at exactly the same thing, which is producing the capability for making high quality decisions.
[01:55:41.305 --> 01:55:41.985]  That's all it means.
[01:55:44.167 --> 01:55:55.026]  And if you have a system that can make very high quality decisions, which means it takes into account much more information than a human could do, it's able to look further in the future than a human could do.
[01:55:57.563 --> 01:56:02.225]  The third part of the triangle, so to speak, is what's the objective?
[01:56:02.965 --> 01:56:06.066]  So it's using lots of information, it's looking far ahead into the future, that's great.
[01:56:06.766 --> 01:56:09.067]  What's the objective that it's trying to achieve?
[01:56:10.428 --> 01:56:21.331]  If that objective is not perfectly aligned with the values of us humans, then that creates the possibility for bad things to happen.
[01:56:21.972 --> 01:56:25.693]  That, in some sense, is the definition of conflict.
[01:56:26.825 --> 01:56:34.934]  And getting into a conflict with systems that are more capable than we are doesn't sound like a good idea.
[01:56:35.575 --> 01:56:43.984]  So the solution seems to be that we have to make sure the values of the machine are aligned with the values of the human race.
[01:56:46.161 --> 01:56:52.883]  So, one way to get that to happen is for the machine to observe what humans do.
[01:56:52.963 --> 01:56:57.945]  Not only what we do, but what is our attitude to what we do and what other people do.
[01:56:58.505 --> 01:57:04.667]  So, if someone gets put in jail, we learn that that was an act contrary to human values.
[01:57:05.227 --> 01:57:13.110]  If someone makes, gets up in the morning, makes a cup of coffee, then you, the machine learns that, you know, having some coffee in the morning is
[01:57:14.259 --> 01:57:22.863]  It's valuable to humans, vital to humans, and there is a lot of information out there.
[01:57:22.963 --> 01:57:25.885]  Who gets to decide what is positively beneficial?
[01:57:26.305 --> 01:57:30.467]  Is it going to be some government agency or some bureaucracy?
[01:57:30.547 --> 01:57:31.407]  Who gets to decide?
[01:57:31.447 --> 01:57:34.889]  Because, for instance, if you take autonomous drones,
[01:57:35.889 --> 01:57:43.556]  Well, what the human would want them to do is be really accurate and have precision, you know, so that it'll strike its target.
[01:57:44.136 --> 01:57:50.781]  But maybe the person on the receiving end of that drone strike, that's not going to be beneficial to them.
[01:57:51.662 --> 01:58:01.830]  And we know sometimes war is waged for the wrong reasons, and people decide for the wrong reasons that they want this machine to do their bidding, basically.
[01:58:04.151 --> 01:58:06.772]  I mean that's not really something that people can even backtrack.
[01:58:06.852 --> 01:58:08.473]  That technology is already there.
[01:58:09.313 --> 01:58:14.815]  But so who kind of gets to decide what's beneficial and is there any way to control some of this?
[01:58:14.835 --> 01:58:21.898]  We're going to come back in the next little segment ahead of Joseph Curl joining us and have Leanne finish this video.
[01:58:21.918 --> 01:58:23.099]  But you were just making the point that
[01:58:24.437 --> 01:58:26.138]  This is the crossroads right now.
[01:58:26.158 --> 01:58:27.940]  I mean, go ahead and make that point you were telling me.
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:35.125]  Yes, we are on the precipice of a decision that is going to alter the course of humanity for all time.
[01:58:35.205 --> 01:58:36.766]  This AI, it's going to happen.
[01:58:36.927 --> 01:58:38.328]  AI has a future.
[01:58:38.448 --> 01:58:38.828]  It's here.
[01:58:38.888 --> 01:58:41.650]  It's just the question is, what is the future for humanity?
[01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:51.277]  And are we going to be involved in that or just let the globalists build a nightmare system, which they are building an anti-human computer grid and training the robots to exterminate us autonomously?
[01:58:51.297 --> 01:58:52.178]  Thank you for listening to GZN.
[01:58:52.198 --> 01:58:52.758]  We'll be right back.

[02:00:16.623 --> 02:00:17.263]  Big Brother.
[02:00:17.923 --> 02:00:18.964]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:19.705 --> 02:00:20.825]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:21.466 --> 02:00:22.266]  You want answers?
[02:00:23.047 --> 02:00:24.027]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.608 --> 02:00:28.230]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.770 --> 02:00:31.132]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:32.132 --> 02:00:34.675]  I'm about to create a whole bunch of new liners.
[02:00:34.715 --> 02:00:35.395]  Not that they're bad.
[02:00:35.435 --> 02:00:36.036]  They're staples.
[02:00:36.116 --> 02:00:36.917]  We've had them for years.
[02:00:36.937 --> 02:00:38.938]  Some of them for 18 years.
[02:00:39.159 --> 02:00:42.982]  But when I just can't help but talk along with them, we got problems.
[02:00:43.042 --> 02:00:44.263]  Infowars.com.
[02:00:44.323 --> 02:00:45.404]  Exactly what I was talking about.
[02:00:45.865 --> 02:00:49.188]  It's not going to be the Japanese model where they're putting all their money into humanoid robots.
[02:00:49.488 --> 02:00:50.989]  They think that's the next car thing.
[02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.950]  Sell those to every home.
[02:00:52.250 --> 02:00:54.933]  Yeah, money-wise, sales-wise, that's important.
[02:00:55.896 --> 02:00:57.837]  But the globalists will just clone those real fast.
[02:00:58.037 --> 02:01:06.002]  The Western system is, go with smart meters, AI systems, to seize control of every appliance, every automobile, everything, and run your life.
[02:01:06.322 --> 02:01:09.824]  Here it is, InfoWars.com from Oxfam and the UN.
[02:01:10.284 --> 02:01:12.205]  This is Breaking and InfoWars.com.
[02:01:12.746 --> 02:01:15.527]  UK government announces plan to remotely control vehicles.
[02:01:16.048 --> 02:01:19.790]  State to seize control of cars via Wi-Fi to hack your car.
[02:01:20.691 --> 02:01:22.353]  Government to hack your car and take control of it.
[02:01:22.373 --> 02:01:23.314]  I mean, that's the real headline.
[02:01:23.714 --> 02:01:28.540]  See, InfoWars is always watering things down because reality is much worse than even my reporters have come up with.
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:30.162]  People say, oh, stop exaggerating.
[02:01:30.602 --> 02:01:33.706]  Okay, there aren't just hundreds of cancer viruses in many vaccines.
[02:01:33.726 --> 02:01:34.647]  There's thousands, okay?
[02:01:34.687 --> 02:01:35.829]  I mean, you know, it's worse than I said.
[02:01:36.381 --> 02:01:47.784]  UK government announces plans to remotely control vehicles, state to seize control of cars via Wi-Fi sensors to reduce traffic congestion and global warming, and then it goes through, they're just, the cars are already robot, all the new ones.
[02:01:48.264 --> 02:01:48.905]  I told you!
[02:01:48.925 --> 02:01:50.185]  And they're gonna tax you!
[02:01:50.525 --> 02:01:51.085]  It's here!
[02:01:51.365 --> 02:01:52.345]  Leanne, boom!
[02:01:52.506 --> 02:01:53.506]  The robot takeover!
[02:01:54.366 --> 02:01:55.427]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:01:55.447 --> 02:01:56.367]  What does that even mean?
[02:01:56.387 --> 02:01:58.829]  They're going to take over the car to... Go read the article.
[02:01:58.849 --> 02:02:01.731]  You can't have traffic congestion for global... It's for the Earth!
[02:02:01.791 --> 02:02:02.751]  It's for the Earth!
[02:02:02.931 --> 02:02:04.152]  Yes, gotta save the Earth.
[02:02:04.172 --> 02:02:05.113]  Go kill yourself.
[02:02:05.253 --> 02:02:06.053]  Stop breathing.
[02:02:06.353 --> 02:02:08.715]  Let's go to the conclusion of the interview.
[02:02:08.755 --> 02:02:10.136]  It'll all be edited with B-roll.
[02:02:10.176 --> 02:02:11.717]  Really powerful tonight on the Nightly News.
[02:02:11.977 --> 02:02:15.059]  But let's go back to more of the writer of the best-selling book, AI.
[02:02:15.119 --> 02:02:15.579]  Here it is.
[02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:19.962]  Is there any way to control some of the systems that are already growing?
[02:02:21.370 --> 02:02:22.311]  So that's a great question.
[02:02:23.232 --> 02:02:30.056]  I think the issue of autonomous weapons is a very immediate one, in some ways much more immediate than the kinds of things we've just been talking about.
[02:02:31.938 --> 02:02:44.487]  And my own view is that it's a mistake to think just about replacing current functions that are done by humans with machines.
[02:02:44.527 --> 02:02:46.228]  So right now we have drones, but they're
[02:02:46.866 --> 02:02:52.828]  The targeting decisions are made by a human who, you know, is getting the remote video feed from the drone.
[02:02:53.469 --> 02:02:57.470]  And the human identifies the target and the human pulls the trigger.
[02:02:59.031 --> 02:03:05.193]  And so people are talking about, is it acceptable to replace that particular function with a computer program?
[02:03:07.534 --> 02:03:10.736]  And the argument then focuses on accuracy and
[02:03:12.715 --> 02:03:21.704]  Uh, you know, moral agency and liability and responsibility and, you know, whether it exactly fits the Geneva Convention, uh, and issues like that.
[02:03:22.404 --> 02:03:26.668]  Um, and that argument is playing out right now in the United Nations.
[02:03:27.469 --> 02:03:32.834]  Uh, so, so it will get resolved one way or the other, and, and that's the right place.
[02:03:33.254 --> 02:03:33.855]  I think the...
[02:03:35.607 --> 02:03:43.554]  The collection of nations of the world need to decide on what kinds of military capabilities are actually allowable.
[02:03:45.215 --> 02:03:50.100]  But the reason I think it's a mistake is because it assumes that everything remains the same.
[02:03:50.620 --> 02:03:56.545]  That we just replace an existing human function with an algorithm or a machine and nothing else changes.
[02:03:56.585 --> 02:04:00.089]  But in fact, if you have autonomous weapons, you're going to have an arms race.
[02:04:01.139 --> 02:04:04.461]  There you go, he really gets into the powerful stuff now.
[02:04:04.801 --> 02:04:07.562]  This will all be on the Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[02:04:07.582 --> 02:04:09.803]  But Leigh Ann, I wanted to give you one minute to finish up.
[02:04:10.624 --> 02:04:20.988]  Right, well obviously the autonomous weapons, a lot of people who are involved in this, AI, you know, they want to be able to take this further, but they are saying we need common sense, we need ethics.
[02:04:21.669 --> 02:04:25.711]  And I'm also going to talk about on the news tonight, something that's even more pressing,
[02:04:26.591 --> 02:04:29.013]  Much sooner than 2045, as has been predicted.
[02:04:29.713 --> 02:04:34.457]  No idea what humans in the transition period are going to do for jobs.
[02:04:35.137 --> 02:04:36.979]  It is going to be a job... Well, that's the problem.
[02:04:37.019 --> 02:04:39.741]  The globalists are engineering it to make us obsolete and saying it.
[02:04:39.981 --> 02:04:43.683]  So the scientists and the writers saying, we don't know what to do, we've got to talk about it.
[02:04:43.724 --> 02:04:45.265]  The plan's already been made to get rid of us.
[02:04:45.525 --> 02:04:48.907]  Yeah, and the economists, they all want to know, what do we do?
[02:04:48.927 --> 02:04:49.308]  What do we do?
[02:04:49.328 --> 02:04:50.649]  But they have no solutions.
[02:04:51.029 --> 02:04:51.569]  No answers.
[02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:53.911]  Well, they ought to read what the transhumanist eugenicists are saying.
[02:04:53.931 --> 02:04:54.751]  They're going to kill everybody.
[02:04:55.913 --> 02:04:59.097]  Well, that's the thing that's... Gotta talk to Bill Joy and read his article.
[02:04:59.137 --> 02:05:02.201]  And the robots can do it, because they have no compassion, no care.
[02:05:03.223 --> 02:05:05.927]  Leanne McAdoo, you'll be hosting the news tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[02:05:06.047 --> 02:05:06.487]  Great job.
[02:05:06.828 --> 02:05:09.592]  We'll be back with Joe Curl for The Washington Times.
[02:05:10.816 --> 02:05:14.317]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:14.457 --> 02:05:18.419]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:18.739 --> 02:05:20.199]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:20.519 --> 02:05:28.102]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:28.382 --> 02:05:29.222]  But for how long?

[02:08:23.021 --> 02:08:30.764]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:38.787 --> 02:08:47.870]  Well, I was up in Dallas one time visiting family staying in a hotel and right there in the middle of the restaurant bar comes walking over Joe Curl.
[02:08:48.874 --> 02:08:51.715]  Who I had met up in D.C.
[02:08:51.895 --> 02:08:58.018]  once covering Bilderberg and Joe Curl has been up there for 30 years I guess or so in D.C.
[02:08:59.139 --> 02:09:02.880]  He doesn't look that old but he's been there with the Washington Times, you name it.
[02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:11.124]  He was there when the Drudge Report basically started and was involved really since the beginning of it at the Washington Times working back and forth with the Drudge.
[02:09:11.524 --> 02:09:13.505]  Now he has launched his own big site
[02:09:15.026 --> 02:09:41.274]  uh... over at the washington times dot com right read and that's a joseph curl and i want to get him on because he don't call me an insider insider he just is up there on capitol hill every day you know he's covering the white house he's got the inside scoop not the state-run media angle and i gotta tell you the washington times just gets better and better you can say what you want about who started it or whatever the point is they cover
[02:09:42.042 --> 02:09:44.164]  You know, the Pentagon training to take on the Tea Party.
[02:09:44.424 --> 02:09:45.745]  They cover Fast and Furious.
[02:09:45.786 --> 02:09:46.987]  They cover Benghazi Gate.
[02:09:47.287 --> 02:09:53.333]  It's DrudgeReport.com, TheWashingtonTimes.com, WorldNetDaily.com, Drudge, InfoWars.
[02:09:54.674 --> 02:09:57.096]  That's really about it, and that scares me.
[02:09:57.497 --> 02:10:01.720]  It's good to see more and more sites out there starting to cover some of these issues, but
[02:10:03.228 --> 02:10:10.833]  It's just scary sometimes to realize how few big sites there are that will actually tackle stuff that's painful for both political parties.
[02:10:11.513 --> 02:10:13.935]  The world, it seems, is being set on fire right now.
[02:10:15.271 --> 02:10:16.372]  Major destabilization.
[02:10:16.733 --> 02:10:20.757]  Obama has said again that the world's never been more stable under his leadership.
[02:10:21.498 --> 02:10:26.364]  He also says 2 plus 2 equals 5, and that you can keep your doctor, and that raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit.
[02:10:26.644 --> 02:10:29.728]  I know I say that pretty much every day, but it's just repeating the craziness.
[02:10:30.369 --> 02:10:35.534]  RightRead.com will take you to the subsection of the Washington Times.
[02:10:36.215 --> 02:10:38.036]  Well, it's affiliated with a lot of different organizations.
[02:10:38.276 --> 02:10:41.977]  He'll explain it all to us, because I don't want to butcher the facts here, but it's an excellent site.
[02:10:42.417 --> 02:10:44.318]  He's an American writer and political columnist.
[02:10:44.818 --> 02:10:47.179]  He ran and worked for the Drudge Report for years.
[02:10:47.719 --> 02:10:56.502]  He covered politics for 25-plus years, 12 years as White House correspondent for the Washington Times, columnist for the Washington Times, as well as editor of WriteRead.com.
[02:10:56.923 --> 02:10:58.063]  WriteRead.com.
[02:10:58.383 --> 02:11:00.784]  So explain to me, before we get into all these topics,
[02:11:01.204 --> 02:11:03.865]  Where are the big establishment Republicans going?
[02:11:04.185 --> 02:11:08.766]  Can they weather the storm, allowing open borders, allowing Obamacare to continue?
[02:11:09.066 --> 02:11:10.086]  What's going to happen there?
[02:11:10.526 --> 02:11:13.427]  What's the big summit of Republican candidates Saturday?
[02:11:13.747 --> 02:11:15.027]  What does that mean that you covered?
[02:11:15.747 --> 02:11:16.727]  What'd you pick up there?
[02:11:17.488 --> 02:11:23.449]  We'll also talk about immigration and where potential political candidates stand, and we'll also talk about Obama
[02:11:23.829 --> 02:11:26.611]  And what he's going to do in his last two years in office.
[02:11:26.631 --> 02:11:28.913]  We just passed that Rubicon last week.
[02:11:29.333 --> 02:11:32.256]  But first, tell me about the new news website.
[02:11:33.917 --> 02:11:35.178]  Well thanks Alex, I appreciate it.
[02:11:35.198 --> 02:11:36.259]  That's quite an introduction.
[02:11:36.739 --> 02:11:40.582]  And I was thinking about that the other day, our night in Dallas.
[02:11:40.622 --> 02:11:41.723]  Remember what we ended up doing?
[02:11:42.782 --> 02:11:43.762]  What did we end up doing?
[02:11:44.202 --> 02:11:45.923]  Oh, crashing Dick Cheney's party!
[02:11:46.663 --> 02:11:48.543]  Carl Rhodes' party, that's right.
[02:11:48.843 --> 02:11:49.043]  Yeah.
[02:11:49.624 --> 02:11:51.604]  I mean, Dick Cheney was there.
[02:11:51.644 --> 02:11:52.844]  That's right, Dick Cheney was there.
[02:11:52.864 --> 02:11:53.684]  They wouldn't let us in.
[02:11:53.704 --> 02:11:55.145]  They saw you coming from a mile away.
[02:11:59.546 --> 02:12:00.206]  That was fun.
[02:12:00.266 --> 02:12:01.886]  And of course, we didn't have anything to drink, though.
[02:12:02.726 --> 02:12:03.327]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:12:03.667 --> 02:12:04.887]  We just drank lemonade all night.
[02:12:05.563 --> 02:12:07.424]  Absolutely.
[02:12:07.444 --> 02:12:11.025]  So, yes, new site, exciting.
[02:12:11.045 --> 02:12:13.026]  Did four years at Drudge and it was fantastic.
[02:12:13.066 --> 02:12:14.466]  Had a great time there, learned a lot.
[02:12:14.966 --> 02:12:19.308]  Drudge is a great guy and it was just time for me to break out and do my own thing.
[02:12:20.191 --> 02:12:25.994]  It'll never be the size and power of the Drudge Report, as you know, is huge and enormous.
[02:12:26.074 --> 02:12:27.315]  But he links to your stuff.
[02:12:27.375 --> 02:12:28.755]  That's the amazing thing about Drudge.
[02:12:28.795 --> 02:12:30.376]  I mean, he supported Breitbart when he left.
[02:12:30.696 --> 02:12:31.557]  He's supporting you.
[02:12:31.877 --> 02:12:36.059]  He just really is all about the information in a media system full of egomaniacs.
[02:12:36.079 --> 02:12:36.759]  He's the opposite.
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:39.961]  That's right, and that's why he links to you guys, too.
[02:12:40.001 --> 02:12:40.921]  I mean, he loves your work.
[02:12:40.961 --> 02:12:42.582]  He knows that you guys are breaking stories.
[02:12:43.243 --> 02:12:52.830]  He knows that the liberal media is, you know, pooh-poohing you guys and talking about conspiracy whack jobs out there, but he knows that you're getting to the real stuff, and that's why he likes you guys so much as well.
[02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:53.730]  Well, that's what you're doing.
[02:12:53.790 --> 02:12:58.074]  Tell us about WriteRead.com and what it's affiliated with, because I may have gotten some of that wrong.
[02:12:58.094 --> 02:12:58.874]  I just visited the site.
[02:12:58.894 --> 02:13:00.035]  I don't know all the details.
[02:13:00.115 --> 02:13:01.216]  And then let's get into the news.
[02:13:02.216 --> 02:13:04.277]  Yeah, and it's connected to the Washington Times.
[02:13:04.597 --> 02:13:11.660]  They were kind enough to offer me help starting it and running it and access to all their readers and everything, so I took them up on it.
[02:13:11.700 --> 02:13:18.843]  I've been there for just about 20 years now, on and off with them, doing all kinds of different things, and so loyal to the great Washington Times.
[02:13:18.904 --> 02:13:19.484]  I think you're right.
[02:13:19.524 --> 02:13:22.445]  I think they're getting better and better, and they're coming on.
[02:13:22.465 --> 02:13:28.028]  They've got all kinds of new guys going, and it's really going to be an exciting 2016 with the kind of stuff they're doing.
[02:13:29.068 --> 02:13:35.053]  My idea really is to try to get people another place to go for information.
[02:13:35.093 --> 02:13:44.019]  I think what's happening in the world today is, you know, on the internet and the media, there's so much stuff and it's hard to get through it all.
[02:13:45.502 --> 02:13:52.367]  I'm assuming people are going to go and read Drudge and hopefully they'll click over to me and take a look at what I'm doing as well because there's so much stuff out there
[02:14:09.107 --> 02:14:10.047]  I think so.
[02:14:26.476 --> 02:14:29.339]  Exactly, and speaking of Benghazi, maybe we should go there first.
[02:14:29.419 --> 02:14:37.206]  Judicial Watch got these new documents, and as your headline shows, the White House is now walking back their previous lies.
[02:14:37.606 --> 02:14:39.828]  Will they get away with this, and what do the documents show?
[02:14:40.949 --> 02:14:44.112]  Well, it's been a shocking day up on the Hill with these guys.
[02:14:45.054 --> 02:14:49.195]  They're really saying, you know, they've been footwalking these documents.
[02:14:49.235 --> 02:14:56.897]  I mean, we're talking about something that happened more than two years ago, and Congress still doesn't have the documents they've asked for time and again.
[02:14:56.917 --> 02:15:06.380]  These guys literally had the gall to stand up there today, the Justice Department or State Department officials, and say, well, we're not really sure what documents it is you're looking for.
[02:15:07.427 --> 02:15:13.393]  And the Republicans on the committee were all saying, look, we've told you over and over again what documents we want.
[02:15:13.433 --> 02:15:15.275]  We want access to these 22 witnesses.
[02:15:15.876 --> 02:15:19.497]  And you've got this State Department guy up there going, well, why don't you prioritize it?
[02:15:19.517 --> 02:15:20.918]  Tell us which ones you want to see.
[02:15:20.958 --> 02:15:23.258]  We'll see if we can get to make that happen.
[02:15:23.298 --> 02:15:38.163]  But really what they've been doing is, and this is what the media and the administration in Cahoots has been doing, is they're trying to, they're killing this thing by making it seem, they're dragging their feet on this so that nothing ever happens.
[02:15:38.263 --> 02:15:40.064]  And they put these things out every once in a while.
[02:15:40.644 --> 02:15:57.374]  Like, recently they dumped a bunch of documents on a Friday, late on a Friday, and these were documents that, again, like you said, Judicial Watch got a hold of a bunch of great documents, showing what had really happened there and showing again that the administration was sitting on and not releasing all this information.
[02:15:57.894 --> 02:16:09.721]  What the administration's goal is, what Obama's goal is, is to make this scheme as if it's just the Republicans on a witch hunt, there's nothing there, they just won't let it go, they just keep hounding about it.
[02:16:10.316 --> 02:16:11.897]  And for a lot of people, it's working.
[02:16:11.977 --> 02:16:13.877]  A lot of people think, well, what are they doing?
[02:16:13.918 --> 02:16:16.379]  They're still, you know, they're on and on again about this.
[02:16:16.419 --> 02:16:20.840]  Well, that's because the Republican leadership doesn't ever attack.
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:34.326]  If they would attack Obama on Obamacare, if they would attack Obama on blanket amnesty outside of law, if they would attack Obama on what really happened in Benghazi or Fast and Furious or IRSgate, he would be impeached right now.
[02:16:35.146 --> 02:16:44.275]  And the truth is, from my view, they are bought and paid for by the same special interests, at least McConnell and Boehner are, and are basically letting Obama take over.
[02:16:44.735 --> 02:16:54.084]  I mean, I'm scared of what he may do in the next two years, shifting gears then back into the other issue, because it's all tied together, as you know, Joe Curl, who just joined us from his website, rightread.com.
[02:16:55.325 --> 02:17:04.012]  What do we do about the huge landslide that happened, and now the Republican leadership is sitting on top of it, ignoring the Constitution, and ignoring the landslide?
[02:17:04.252 --> 02:17:05.513]  What do you think is going to come out of this?
[02:17:06.794 --> 02:17:15.820]  Well, I think there's an awful lot of intrigue going along under the current, behind the scenes, in Capitol Hill right now.
[02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:23.506]  I mean, you saw what happened with John Boehner, and the mutiny that took place, and there were a lot of, you know, there were reports
[02:17:24.127 --> 02:17:30.337]  But I heard at the time that there were upwards of 50 Republican members who were going to vote against John Boehner.
[02:17:30.377 --> 02:17:33.382]  Now what happens when that starts to swirl around?
[02:17:33.442 --> 02:17:35.986]  Nobody wants to get out ahead of it because if you vote against Boehner,
[02:17:36.804 --> 02:17:43.526]  And you don't oust them as Speaker, then you don't get any good committee assignments and you just made a powerful enemy.
[02:17:43.646 --> 02:17:51.848]  So what happened there was a lot of guys who were ready to go, they ended up getting cold feet and everyone went back and went ahead and supported them.
[02:17:51.868 --> 02:17:54.869]  But you still had 24 people vote against them, which was pretty bold.
[02:17:55.570 --> 02:18:00.711]  And right now what's happening is the party is splintering on Capitol Hill.
[02:18:00.751 --> 02:18:03.972]  There are different factions within the Republicans that
[02:18:04.628 --> 02:18:05.148]  We're good to go.
[02:18:33.001 --> 02:18:43.747]  A lot of Republicans, and especially conservatives, what they're finding out is that they're going to have a lot of trouble pushing things through because they don't have a solid majority.
[02:18:43.787 --> 02:18:48.649]  They don't really have the kind of solidity that they need.
[02:18:49.110 --> 02:18:52.932]  Not everyone, the unity that they're looking for is not there, and they're in trouble.
[02:18:53.132 --> 02:18:54.493]  Well Joe, what's going to happen
[02:18:55.427 --> 02:19:08.795]  When the next election comes around and Republicans haven't delivered anything, haven't repealed any of Obamacare, have let Obama open the borders up, I mean there's going to be a huge backlash in my view and an even bigger Tea Party contention I think will be sent.
[02:19:09.115 --> 02:19:20.002]  I think it's key for the Tea Party to explain that they've been betrayed and sat on by a bunch of rhinos and that we need to remove the rhinos if we have any hope.
[02:19:21.516 --> 02:19:34.146]  That's right, and that's exactly what, that's the danger that, you know, I remember when it was a huge landslide on November 4th for Republicans, I remember Pelosi and other Democrats talking about, well this is, you know, quietly talking about the fact that
[02:19:34.818 --> 02:19:37.800]  This could be a good thing for them because now they've got a two-year lead in.
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:48.147]  If the Republicans get nothing done and can't get over this kind of intra-party fighting, squabbling, then the Democrats are going to say, look, these guys have been in control for two years.
[02:19:48.707 --> 02:19:49.688]  They haven't done anything.
[02:19:50.008 --> 02:19:51.269]  You should put us back in power.
[02:19:51.309 --> 02:19:52.910]  And that will be a pretty powerful argument.
[02:19:53.610 --> 02:19:56.173]  For voters going into the polls on 2016.
[02:19:56.213 --> 02:19:57.214]  So, you're right.
[02:19:57.234 --> 02:20:06.444]  Republicans are either going to have to get together in the next couple of months and really move forward with a unified state, or they're going to face... Stay there!

[02:24:35.044 --> 02:24:36.345]  We're going to be talking about some.
[02:24:36.845 --> 02:24:44.791]  I wanted to get Sha'Carri Jackson's take, along with John Bowne, two of our reporters, on what this political realignment means and the Republican betrayal.
[02:24:44.831 --> 02:24:47.012]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:24:48.137 --> 02:25:02.309]  But then I've got all this other news that I want to run over and just get quick responses in the next segment from Joe Curl, like, UK government announces plan to remotely control vehicles, state to seize control of cars via Wi-Fi sensors to reduce traffic congestion and global warming.
[02:25:02.950 --> 02:25:05.352]  Paul Joseph Watson of Infowars.com reported that.
[02:25:05.792 --> 02:25:12.438]  Drudge Reports got this headline from MSNBC or CNBC, Dow hit by Microsoft, Caterpillar data, disappoint.
[02:25:12.778 --> 02:25:13.659]  Dow falls 400 points today.
[02:25:16.266 --> 02:25:19.990]  Aircraft carrier Stennis has biggest ordnance on loads since 2010.
[02:25:20.350 --> 02:25:24.073]  DEA cameras tracking hundreds of millions of car journeys across the U.S.
[02:25:24.914 --> 02:25:28.858]  Argentine prosecutors shot point-blank in the forehead official.
[02:25:29.278 --> 02:25:31.921]  They eventually admit he was murdered before he exposed the president.
[02:25:33.222 --> 02:25:34.824]  Obamacare costs $50,000 per person per taxpayer.
[02:25:37.864 --> 02:25:38.785]  That's in the Daily Mail.
[02:25:39.866 --> 02:25:44.510]  The big blizzard wasn't the big blizzard, but the New York Times said there'd be no more blizzards by this year.
[02:25:44.810 --> 02:25:48.693]  I mean, it's just a border surge likely in 2015, data shows.
[02:25:49.234 --> 02:25:51.736]  Boehner-McConnell retreat in Obama-Amnesty fight.
[02:25:52.036 --> 02:25:53.718]  Panics conservatives, Washington Times.
[02:25:54.824 --> 02:25:57.807]  I want to talk about the drone and all the panicking as a toy drone crashes.
[02:25:58.447 --> 02:25:59.608]  I mean, there's just so much.
[02:25:59.648 --> 02:26:00.549]  It's just crazy.
[02:26:01.210 --> 02:26:03.492]  Joe Curl, where do you want to go next?
[02:26:03.532 --> 02:26:05.573]  I mean, what else are you focusing on?
[02:26:06.094 --> 02:26:08.916]  They're on your new news site, WriteRead.com.
[02:26:10.518 --> 02:26:16.663]  Well, the latest thing that's happened on the drone debacle is Obama has come out and said that drones need to be regulated.
[02:26:17.364 --> 02:26:19.325]  So that'll be interesting as the
[02:26:20.413 --> 02:26:22.814]  The White House decides to take over all drones.
[02:26:22.874 --> 02:26:26.276]  I guess, you know, kids playing in the backyard are not going to be regulated.
[02:26:26.696 --> 02:26:28.637]  Well, it was already illegal in D.C.
[02:26:28.877 --> 02:26:29.937]  to have a drone and do that.
[02:26:30.057 --> 02:26:33.399]  So, I mean, these laws don't do... It's remote-controlled toys.
[02:26:33.759 --> 02:26:35.940]  It sounds like an excuse to try to ban remote-controlled toys.
[02:26:37.915 --> 02:26:39.636]  Yeah, that's what was really interesting.
[02:26:39.676 --> 02:26:46.120]  I mean, you know, it really does, it's really kind of amazing when you think about what the White House, you know, it is a vulnerable building.
[02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:47.341]  It's right in the middle of D.C.
[02:26:47.821 --> 02:26:50.022]  You can walk up to it from all sides.
[02:26:50.562 --> 02:26:53.784]  You can get within, you know, a couple hundred feet of the front door.
[02:26:53.804 --> 02:26:58.547]  So, and there's just those big old iron, you know, wrought iron bars in front of it.
[02:26:58.567 --> 02:27:05.391]  So, it's really, but now they're saying that the drone was too small to be picked up by radar.
[02:27:05.411 --> 02:27:06.612]  And that really makes you wonder,
[02:27:07.463 --> 02:27:09.584]  What kind of security they've got at the White House.
[02:27:09.624 --> 02:27:33.038]  If they can't handle and see the coming, you know, the future of what kind of security threats they're going to face, it's kind of amazing that they didn't think, you know, boy, I wonder if, you know, if you can fly a drone in there, that means you could arm a drone, put a bunch of weapons on it, put a bomb on it and fly a drone right into the White House and just explode it, you know, right next to the window, fly it inside, smash it through the window and fly it into the residence.
[02:27:33.098 --> 02:27:35.860]  Kind of amazing that they don't have the foresight to know
[02:27:36.540 --> 02:27:37.841]  That's what that's what they say.
[02:28:07.856 --> 02:28:08.396]  Oh, I'm sure.
[02:28:08.496 --> 02:28:19.483]  I mean, but it's again like, you know, the other day when that guy, a couple of months ago, when the guy jumped over the fence and ran to the White House, ran in the front door and was, you know, tackled inside.
[02:28:20.104 --> 02:28:22.385]  Then they said, well, he wasn't armed, it wasn't a danger.
[02:28:22.405 --> 02:28:24.226]  Then it turns out, of course, he was armed.
[02:28:24.246 --> 02:28:25.007]  He had a knife on him.
[02:28:25.067 --> 02:28:30.350]  So it's confusing what these guys, they just seem to keep having problems.
[02:28:30.370 --> 02:28:32.631]  They can't really protect the president.
[02:28:32.691 --> 02:28:33.372]  It's kind of frightening.
[02:28:34.687 --> 02:28:37.449]  Well, I mean, at the same time, we are a free society.
[02:28:37.509 --> 02:28:38.750]  And look at 10 Downing Street.
[02:28:38.790 --> 02:28:40.471]  I mean, somebody could fly a drone into that.
[02:28:40.491 --> 02:28:46.396]  I mean, I think it just comes down to the fact that I don't think we can be held hostage by all the potential threats.
[02:28:47.276 --> 02:28:48.397]  But you're right.
[02:28:48.577 --> 02:28:58.264]  As technology proliferates, I don't see how we're ever going to stop crazy people being able to do damage, no matter how big a police state we build.
[02:28:58.324 --> 02:28:59.105]  So what is the answer?
[02:29:00.868 --> 02:29:10.857]  Well, that's a great point, because what happens right away now is exactly what Obama's talking about, which is like, let's have the state control this, let's have the state control that.
[02:29:10.897 --> 02:29:23.528]  And the way they're justifying things like they're capturing photographs of all these license plates, the idea behind that is, well, we'll track drug dealers, but that's not really how it gets used.
[02:29:23.588 --> 02:29:26.170]  Eventually, it gets used on everyone.
[02:29:26.230 --> 02:29:28.352]  Everyone's going to be collected by the government.
[02:29:28.872 --> 02:29:31.913]  And they're going to put a big database together that's going to have us all in.
[02:29:32.233 --> 02:29:33.373]  And they basically admit that.
[02:29:33.393 --> 02:29:36.994]  I mean, they admit that 10 years ago it started just on the border, but now it's nationwide.
[02:29:37.394 --> 02:29:39.355]  Hundreds of millions of people are tracked a year.
[02:29:39.795 --> 02:29:40.695]  Basically everybody.
[02:29:41.115 --> 02:29:44.556]  And they're keeping a complete database history of this, but government's exempt.
[02:29:45.497 --> 02:29:45.977]  Amazing.
[02:29:46.077 --> 02:29:46.717]  Joe, stay there.
[02:29:46.737 --> 02:29:49.978]  I want to come back and get more into big stories you're focused on.
[02:29:50.498 --> 02:29:57.840]  And I'm not an insider like you in D.C., but I've really noticed the Washington Times has brought it up several notches, so congratulations.
[02:29:59.642 --> 02:30:02.650]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.573 --> 02:30:06.260]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.740 --> 02:30:19.406]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[02:30:19.727 --> 02:30:29.734]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[02:30:30.274 --> 02:30:36.339]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:30:36.679 --> 02:30:42.842]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:30:43.082 --> 02:30:51.265]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[02:30:51.685 --> 02:30:54.487]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:30:54.767 --> 02:30:55.927]  No needles, no injections.
[02:30:56.307 --> 02:30:57.588]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:30:57.688 --> 02:30:58.608]  Try it for yourself.
[02:30:58.889 --> 02:30:59.809]  Discover the secret.
[02:31:00.209 --> 02:31:00.550]  Secret 12.
[02:31:01.310 --> 02:31:03.352]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[02:31:10.458 --> 02:31:11.358]  Alex Jones here.
[02:31:11.458 --> 02:31:20.426]  For the last two years I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:31:20.626 --> 02:31:25.870]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[02:31:26.170 --> 02:31:29.693]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[02:31:29.893 --> 02:31:39.261]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.
[02:31:39.461 --> 02:31:50.630]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity.
[02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:55.654]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts
[02:31:55.854 --> 02:31:58.835]  With exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[02:32:10.325 --> 02:32:18.870]  What disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time?
[02:32:19.230 --> 02:32:25.874]  NASA has already set the countdown timer, and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[02:32:26.354 --> 02:32:29.796]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[02:32:29.836 --> 02:32:31.057]  population could perish.
[02:32:31.477 --> 02:32:34.479]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[02:32:34.959 --> 02:32:36.700]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[02:32:37.180 --> 02:32:38.441]  Mass riots will follow.
[02:32:38.821 --> 02:32:40.542]  Ancient diseases will re-emerge.
[02:32:41.003 --> 02:32:44.505]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?
[02:32:45.085 --> 02:32:55.012]  Go to DarkestDays.info to find out proven methods of protecting yourself, your loved ones, and even your entire community when this worst-case scenario unravels.
[02:32:55.492 --> 02:33:00.015]  That's D-A-R-K-E-S-T-D-A-Y-S dot I-N-F-O.
[02:33:00.396 --> 02:33:02.037]  DarkestDays.info.
[02:33:02.417 --> 02:33:06.800]  Go there before this life-saving information becomes unavailable to the large public.
[02:33:07.280 --> 02:33:09.541]  Go to DarkestDays.info now.
[02:33:11.541 --> 02:33:15.742]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:15.802 --> 02:33:17.043]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:43.766 --> 02:33:46.370]  We're good.
[02:33:59.423 --> 02:34:02.725]  For the 2016 run, who does he think the real leader is?
[02:34:02.745 --> 02:34:06.206]  Who do you think, you know, could come from behind as a dark horse?
[02:34:06.226 --> 02:34:15.170]  And we're going to get some wildcard questions from our reporters that are in the control room studio, Jakari Jackson and John Bowne as well.
[02:34:15.731 --> 02:34:25.335]  I'm going to ask about Chris Christie launches PAC ahead of likely presidential run, the rivalry between Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney and more.
[02:34:25.415 --> 02:34:26.656]  But before we do that,
[02:34:27.745 --> 02:34:38.689]  If you're a TV viewer, you'll notice I'm wearing the Molon Lave Long Sleeve Camouflage Made in America shirt that is so popular we cannot keep them in stock.
[02:34:40.049 --> 02:34:44.231]  In fact, of this exact design and camo, it's taken us months to get more.
[02:34:44.271 --> 02:34:55.275]  A small amount of them are back in at InfowarsStore.com or MadeIn1776.com because they are made in America and are very affordable.
[02:34:56.377 --> 02:35:06.388]  That's how we fund our operation, is bringing you high-quality products that we know constitutionalists, libertarians, conservatives, classical liberals, in the Thomas Jefferson vein, want and need.
[02:35:07.068 --> 02:35:11.112]  In three days, the specials end, or when the new year comes, I guess three and a half days.
[02:35:11.853 --> 02:35:20.762]  We've got 10% off all the water filtration systems are the highest quality, lowest price with 10% off you'll find anywhere on ProPure G2, Clearly Filtered, you name it.
[02:35:21.342 --> 02:35:22.984]  You get free shipping on top of that.
[02:35:23.024 --> 02:35:24.585]  We only do that special once a year.
[02:35:25.006 --> 02:35:30.831]  Free shipping right now on all water filtration systems and again your purchase funds the operation.
[02:35:31.872 --> 02:35:38.056]  We also have, ending in January, the New Year Special, where you can get half off on a yearly membership.
[02:35:38.656 --> 02:35:46.462]  20 people can use each nightly news, PrisonPlanet.tv membership, and you can share that with friends and family.
[02:35:46.482 --> 02:35:49.383]  Again, 20 people can use your username and get on simultaneously.
[02:35:49.684 --> 02:35:51.185]  That's 12 cents per person.
[02:35:51.825 --> 02:35:53.046]  A yearly membership, now $29.95 or $2.50 a month.
[02:35:56.624 --> 02:36:04.992]  Or you can just sign up monthly $5.95 for a trial and it is an amazing website and really been updated and has the best servers and systems on it now.
[02:36:05.313 --> 02:36:10.538]  PrisonPlanet.tv, you're funding the very tip of the spear, the cutting edge in the info war.
[02:36:10.858 --> 02:36:12.180]  So thank you all for your support.
[02:36:12.260 --> 02:36:16.023]  And finally, Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity.
[02:36:17.193 --> 02:36:20.355]  Booster is, I don't know what it is, it's almost 20 or more than 20.
[02:36:20.495 --> 02:36:21.436]  I need to count them all up.
[02:36:21.516 --> 02:36:30.701]  It's a bunch of well-known stuff like Echinacea and Golden Seal and the rest of it, with all the different studies out there that it boosts immunity way better than all the garbage the system pushes.
[02:36:31.162 --> 02:36:32.102]  It's concentrated.
[02:36:32.222 --> 02:36:33.403]  It's a discount brand.
[02:36:33.443 --> 02:36:40.708]  We call it Right Side from InfoWarsLife.com, where we take herbs and things that are super high quality and concentrated but very affordable.
[02:36:41.468 --> 02:36:41.708]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:59.574 --> 02:37:03.496]  It's what I'm taking, my children are taking, and the purchase supports the broadcast.
[02:37:03.776 --> 02:37:14.080]  PrisonPlanet.tv memberships, the high-quality nutraceuticals, the Patriot apparel, all of it available at InfoWarsStore.com and the subdomains.
[02:37:14.460 --> 02:37:17.722]  Going back to Joe Curl, who again has launched a bold new
[02:37:19.302 --> 02:37:28.186]  Libertarian, conservative, paleo-conservative style, hardcore website that is a subdomain of the Washington Times.
[02:37:28.246 --> 02:37:31.528]  It's basically teamed up with them, rightread.com.
[02:37:31.548 --> 02:37:40.791]  And the reason that's exciting is it means more real conservatives out there battling with the Rhino Republicans and neocons.
[02:37:41.332 --> 02:37:43.332]  And it's that battle I'm talking about right now.
[02:37:43.372 --> 02:37:46.534]  The big money behind Chris Christie, the big money behind Jeb Bush.
[02:37:48.394 --> 02:37:48.815]  I don't know.
[02:38:03.234 --> 02:38:04.034]  Well, there was a big summit.
[02:38:04.054 --> 02:38:07.195]  The first really at the time, the first of the 2016 cycle was in Iowa on Saturday.
[02:38:33.004 --> 02:38:33.964]  You're having the flip-flopping!
[02:39:02.847 --> 02:39:03.528]  That's right, yeah.
[02:39:03.548 --> 02:39:07.012]  So he's got a lot of baggage, and you're right, it's another Bush.
[02:39:07.953 --> 02:39:15.022]  It was Bush's mom, who's the mom of Javid and George W., who said, you know, do we really need another Bush?
[02:39:15.082 --> 02:39:15.863]  I mean, we've had enough.
[02:39:15.883 --> 02:39:17.565]  We've had two presidents in that family.
[02:39:18.126 --> 02:39:21.190]  And that's what's really remarkable, is right now we're looking at
[02:39:21.710 --> 02:39:25.111]  The possibility of it being Bush versus Clinton, which would just be insanity.
[02:39:25.171 --> 02:39:32.334]  I mean, having the same people, we apparently, 350 million people, we've only got two families that could produce presidents.
[02:39:32.454 --> 02:39:33.054]  It's crazy.
[02:39:33.134 --> 02:39:40.557]  So that's what was so interesting about Iowa on Saturday, was there were some real new people there with some real new ideas.
[02:39:40.717 --> 02:39:48.120]  And Chris Christie was one of them, but the real star of the thing, the real step out of the day was Scott Walker from Wisconsin.
[02:39:48.743 --> 02:39:51.225]  He really kind of wowed the crowd there.
[02:39:51.265 --> 02:39:52.325]  Very conservative group.
[02:39:52.526 --> 02:39:56.168]  You know, hardcore, grassroots, very into politics.
[02:39:56.248 --> 02:39:57.709]  And they went nuts for him.
[02:39:57.769 --> 02:40:00.551]  So, he's looking like he might be a very strong contender.
[02:40:00.591 --> 02:40:04.754]  I just saw on the wires today that he's created a patch.
[02:40:04.794 --> 02:40:05.875]  So, he's getting ready to go.
[02:40:05.935 --> 02:40:07.215]  So, he was one of the big standouts.
[02:40:07.256 --> 02:40:09.697]  Carly Fiorina, she was another one.
[02:40:09.757 --> 02:40:10.618]  It was very fascinating.
[02:40:10.678 --> 02:40:14.020]  I was very interested to see her because she hasn't done a whole lot.
[02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:14.801]  She's unpopular.
[02:40:15.749 --> 02:40:17.390]  I mean, I hate to be shallow.
[02:40:17.410 --> 02:40:19.231]  She just looks too much like Hillary Clinton.
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:39.701]  She may be setting herself up for a VP nod.
[02:40:40.041 --> 02:40:41.381]  Sure, I was being sarcastic.
[02:40:41.401 --> 02:40:42.141]  Let me ask you this.
[02:40:42.601 --> 02:40:45.162]  What about a Sarah Palin, Ted Cruz ticket?
[02:40:45.442 --> 02:40:47.662]  That just seems like a super sexy ticket.
[02:40:49.063 --> 02:40:50.703]  And again, I've got some problems with Palin.
[02:40:50.943 --> 02:40:52.003]  I really like Ted Cruz.
[02:40:52.043 --> 02:40:54.724]  But remember folks, they're a lot better than Hillary Clinton.
[02:40:55.004 --> 02:40:56.124]  I mean, isn't that a hot ticket?
[02:40:56.184 --> 02:40:58.144]  Or a Rand Paul, Sarah Palin ticket?
[02:40:58.445 --> 02:41:00.585]  Or is her running as VP not good?
[02:41:02.751 --> 02:41:04.072]  I don't know, boy, that's tough.
[02:41:04.212 --> 02:41:07.054]  She didn't do that well in Iowa.
[02:41:07.174 --> 02:41:12.177]  Either her teleprompter broke, which was some reports, or she showed up and just decided to wing it.
[02:41:12.217 --> 02:41:13.578]  But she had a 20-minute spot.
[02:41:13.598 --> 02:41:15.379]  She spoke for 35 minutes.
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:20.423]  She did about 12 minutes of thanking people and reminiscing about Iowa.
[02:41:20.943 --> 02:41:24.825]  It was a rather disjointed and odd speech.
[02:41:24.986 --> 02:41:25.926]  But I do like her blouse.
[02:41:28.576 --> 02:41:29.257]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:41:29.297 --> 02:41:31.258]  I mean, she had a ton of applause lines.
[02:41:31.278 --> 02:41:36.062]  She really, once she got going and once she really got on focus, she was good.
[02:41:36.102 --> 02:41:41.146]  And I think that's what I think, you know, she's another one of those people that she's got so much power.
[02:41:41.166 --> 02:41:46.770]  She can really put something together in a matter of weeks or a few months and she would be a major force.
[02:41:46.830 --> 02:41:48.531]  She could bring huge cash in.
[02:41:48.992 --> 02:41:50.253]  She's got millions of followers.
[02:41:50.273 --> 02:41:52.074]  Are you talking about her on the top of the ticket?
[02:41:52.174 --> 02:41:55.517]  I mean, because that would be big if she went at the top of the ticket.
[02:41:56.934 --> 02:42:00.916]  It would be, but I still get the feeling that she's not really planning to run.
[02:42:00.956 --> 02:42:08.001]  I know that she said she's interested, she told the Washington Post that she was interested, but I really still get the feeling that she's not really gonna go.
[02:42:08.721 --> 02:42:12.103]  And see, that's the reason I think she's good, because she doesn't want power.
[02:42:12.163 --> 02:42:16.626]  And look, I've got big problems with her on her super hawkish stuff, but I just have studied her.
[02:42:16.666 --> 02:42:21.069]  I think the way they demonized her, the way they came after her, that's why I like Rand Paul.
[02:42:21.129 --> 02:42:24.811]  The way they're coming after him... Give me your take on Rand Paul.
[02:42:25.976 --> 02:42:27.917]  Oh, Rand Paul is a serious candidate.
[02:42:27.977 --> 02:42:30.579]  I think he's one of the top three or four.
[02:42:30.599 --> 02:42:34.542]  I mean, what I really see it boiling down to, I like Ben Carson.
[02:42:34.602 --> 02:42:35.662]  He's hugely popular.
[02:42:36.103 --> 02:42:37.724]  Peter Reno gave a good speech.
[02:42:37.824 --> 02:42:39.605]  I think it's coming down to about five people.
[02:42:39.665 --> 02:42:42.587]  It'll probably be Walker, Rand Paul,
[02:42:43.453 --> 02:42:46.455]  Chris Christie, Rick Perry, and Ted Cruz.
[02:42:46.515 --> 02:42:50.357]  I think those are the mysterious ones, and they all kind of bring something different.
[02:42:50.397 --> 02:42:54.699]  I think Christie's going to try to cast himself as a guy that can do that.
[02:42:54.739 --> 02:42:56.320]  He's not going to do great in Iowa.
[02:42:56.380 --> 02:42:59.742]  He's not going to necessarily do great with conservatives.
[02:42:59.782 --> 02:43:02.664]  But his point is, we need to move a little bit past that.
[02:43:02.684 --> 02:43:03.484]  You need to pick somebody.
[02:43:03.504 --> 02:43:10.688]  He said a line in Iowa where he said, if you want somebody who agrees with you 100% of the time, look in the mirror, because that's the only one you're going to find.
[02:43:11.427 --> 02:43:20.065]  We've got to get past the notion that if we disagree with a candidate on one small thing, we're going to abandon that candidate.
[02:43:21.519 --> 02:43:29.424]  We need to find somebody, you know, whoever it is, and we need to not hold our noses, but we need to get past some of the things that we don't necessarily like about him.
[02:43:29.484 --> 02:43:29.904]  Sure.
[02:43:30.165 --> 02:43:31.465]  I think he's a strong candidate.
[02:43:31.585 --> 02:43:33.627]  I think Rick Perry is a real sleeper.
[02:43:33.647 --> 02:43:34.687]  Oh, I agree.
[02:43:34.728 --> 02:43:37.629]  I think people didn't take him seriously last time.
[02:43:38.070 --> 02:43:40.171]  Well, he was on painkillers from back surgery.
[02:43:40.251 --> 02:43:41.092]  I think that's what sunk him.
[02:43:41.132 --> 02:43:41.492]  That's right.
[02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:45.401]  Yeah, and he admitted, too, that he didn't take it as seriously.
[02:43:45.421 --> 02:43:48.121]  You know, he's run several times in Texas.
[02:43:48.141 --> 02:43:51.402]  He's about to become, like, the longest-serving governor in Texas, and he's not already.
[02:43:52.602 --> 02:43:53.882]  He is.
[02:43:54.543 --> 02:43:57.223]  But he said that he didn't take it as seriously as he should have.
[02:43:57.243 --> 02:43:59.284]  It's a different world when you get on the national stage.
[02:43:59.504 --> 02:44:02.764]  And you're right, the painkillers and all that were bad.
[02:44:02.804 --> 02:44:04.125]  But I think he's as serious.
[02:44:04.185 --> 02:44:06.285]  And he's another guy, when you match him up against
[02:44:07.054 --> 02:44:13.978]  I think it shows just how horrible the Democrats and how radical they are, that people like Rick Perry look good compared to them.
[02:44:27.026 --> 02:44:41.825]  But expanding on that, and I want to get some questions and some comments from our crew in there, from our reporters, who join Joe Curl, reporter with us right now, from WriteRead.com, formerly with DrudgeReport.com, and also with WashingtonTimes.com.
[02:44:42.466 --> 02:44:43.527]  When you look at this,
[02:44:45.205 --> 02:44:48.670]  Everybody's saying be moderate Republicans to get Democrats to vote with you.
[02:44:48.750 --> 02:44:55.139]  When you look at the state of the country, the anger, Democrats voting for Tea Party people in some cases that they're so upset.
[02:44:55.640 --> 02:44:58.143]  I think being a radical constitutionalist
[02:44:59.875 --> 02:45:14.385]  And not compromising, and really demonizing Obama, and running against Obama and four more years of Hillary, basically is what Obama's been, or eight more years, is just the continuation of the Clintons.
[02:45:14.465 --> 02:45:17.867]  I think if people get hardcore and aggressive, they're going to win in a landslide.
[02:45:18.128 --> 02:45:20.689]  But if they try to become the Democrats, they're going to lose.
[02:45:20.709 --> 02:45:21.170]  What do you say?
[02:45:22.466 --> 02:45:32.790]  Well, that's the real split right now between that's where Christie's trying to position herself and that's where he's trying to position himself as that compromise candidate.
[02:45:32.830 --> 02:45:36.872]  But there are an awful lot of people who are looking at it and saying, hey, we just did that twice.
[02:45:37.012 --> 02:45:37.712]  We did that with
[02:45:38.212 --> 02:45:39.012]  We did that with McCain.
[02:45:39.032 --> 02:45:40.193]  We did that with Romney.
[02:45:40.613 --> 02:45:41.333]  We didn't like him.
[02:45:41.373 --> 02:45:47.955]  They weren't conservative enough for us, but we held our nose and we, you know, in the case of Romney, 5 million people didn't show up to the polls.
[02:45:47.995 --> 02:45:50.636]  They just said, I don't like either guy.
[02:45:50.656 --> 02:45:51.296]  I'm not showing up.
[02:45:51.316 --> 02:45:51.496]  Sure.
[02:45:51.516 --> 02:45:56.058]  I mean, we had a landslide for Tea Party and the conservatives because they did demonize.
[02:45:56.098 --> 02:45:58.319]  You've got to demonize out of control.
[02:45:59.159 --> 02:46:00.760]  Corruption, because it is evil.
[02:46:01.101 --> 02:46:03.022]  I mean, we're not painting it something it isn't.
[02:46:03.322 --> 02:46:05.384]  I want to go to our reporters for comments and questions.
[02:46:05.664 --> 02:46:09.848]  Jakari Jackson in there in the Infowars.com studios, in the control room.
[02:46:10.348 --> 02:46:13.611]  Jakari, what's your take on this political realignment in the Republican field?
[02:46:14.574 --> 02:46:14.754]  I want
[02:46:29.619 --> 02:46:30.059]  I think so.
[02:46:53.923 --> 02:46:54.785]  Changing paradigm.
[02:46:54.945 --> 02:46:59.853]  Sure, because people are always figuring out meet the new boss same as the old boss, but people are getting mad quicker and quicker.
[02:46:59.933 --> 02:47:01.876]  Used to take years, now it takes months.
[02:47:02.477 --> 02:47:03.659]  Yeah, that's a great question.
[02:47:03.940 --> 02:47:08.227]  Does the political power structure realize how angry people are, Joseph?
[02:47:09.261 --> 02:47:37.843]  Well, that is a great question because that's exactly what, you're right, in some ways the Republicans just got in, they just took over January 6th, it's only been a few weeks, but you're right, people are frustrated already and they're already looking at it and saying, you know, first they could barely pick a speaker and then, you know, they can't get it together on abortion, that was a big debacle where they didn't know what they wanted and they voted, you know, some Republicans voted against it and they had to re-vote it, then you've got the whole mess with Keystone where
[02:47:38.443 --> 02:47:38.984]  I don't know.
[02:47:54.311 --> 02:48:00.034]  50 or 60 brand new Republicans who are in that room that weren't there the last time he gave a State of the Union.
[02:48:00.094 --> 02:48:06.916]  So, he should have, he really, a lot of people have said... And he said, I'll veto anything you try to block me on anything I'm doing.
[02:48:07.397 --> 02:48:10.678]  Open borders, turning off the power, I will veto that.
[02:48:10.718 --> 02:48:12.079]  I mean, it's just the arrogance.
[02:48:13.259 --> 02:48:17.781]  But that's, and then that's the real problem right now that's happening with the Republican Party is
[02:48:18.450 --> 02:48:35.457]  They're looking to, and this is again a problem with keeping the establishment of McConnell and Boehner in there, they're looking now to negotiate and compromise with this president when in fact what the voters did when they put these guys in was they said, go in there and take it to them.
[02:48:35.477 --> 02:48:45.681]  They didn't want them to go in and make deals with Obama and settle for half of everything you want and let him get away with amnesty and deficit spending and all the things that he's doing.
[02:48:46.301 --> 02:48:53.266]  But the Republicans now really are starting to appear as if they're going to toe the line and try to work with this guy.
[02:48:53.306 --> 02:49:02.754]  Your point, Alex, is exactly where a lot of people say the Republican Party needs to go, is get angry about this, get up in their grills about it, get up in their face, and battle it.
[02:49:02.814 --> 02:49:03.494]  Make it a battle.
[02:49:03.534 --> 02:49:03.995]  Well, sure.
[02:49:04.135 --> 02:49:11.981]  I mean, just from political points, even though we know Boehner's is horrible, he could have at least started committee hearings on repeal of Obamacare or part of it.
[02:49:12.201 --> 02:49:13.802]  They're not doing jack crap.
[02:49:14.262 --> 02:49:14.783]  Squat.
[02:49:15.103 --> 02:49:17.706]  I mean, it's so clear that they know there's such pressure.
[02:49:18.026 --> 02:49:23.772]  They don't want to let one inch of resistance in because it'll bring the whole house of cards down and save the country!
[02:49:24.392 --> 02:49:26.034]  I'm going to go back to the reporters.
[02:49:26.334 --> 02:49:28.576]  John Bowne with Jakari Jackson.
[02:49:29.577 --> 02:49:30.738]  Bowne, what's your take on this?
[02:49:30.778 --> 02:49:32.220]  Got any questions or comments for Curl?
[02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:34.781]  Yeah, Mr. Curl, pleasure.
[02:49:37.042 --> 02:49:37.582]  Good, good.
[02:49:38.083 --> 02:49:44.846]  I just wanted to reiterate the wealth that exists in Congress and in the presidency.
[02:49:45.527 --> 02:49:51.570]  The presidential campaign has increased every campaign by two to three billion dollars.
[02:49:52.210 --> 02:49:58.574]  So then we have people in Congress, it costs on average about three and a half million dollars to get into Congress.
[02:49:59.514 --> 02:50:01.936]  They're completely out of touch with the American people.
[02:50:02.076 --> 02:50:05.759]  You're talking about how most of the Democrats are worth hundreds of millions, but want to raise taxes on poor people?
[02:50:05.879 --> 02:50:07.079]  Well, and Republicans too.
[02:50:07.099 --> 02:50:08.020]  They're all in it together.
[02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:10.862]  I know, but if you look at the top 15, it's all Democrats.
[02:50:10.902 --> 02:50:12.944]  I mean, again, I'm not against rich people.
[02:50:13.164 --> 02:50:16.987]  It's that they're for wealth redistribution, but then exempt themselves from most of the taxes.
[02:50:17.287 --> 02:50:23.031]  I'm going to let you come back with more of that bound and finish up your point, but briefly, Carl, what do you think of that?
[02:50:25.259 --> 02:50:28.121]  Well, again, that's where everything's going right now.
[02:50:28.181 --> 02:50:43.112]  If you're looking at, you know, you've finally got the Koch brothers who are going to get into this to the tune of about $750 billion, but you look at people like Forrest and who's backing the Democrats, and again, you've got the liberal media saying, oh, there's so much conservative money in it, they're controlling everything.
[02:50:43.952 --> 02:50:48.875]  Quietly, the Democrats and liberals, you know, liberal money is enormous of what's happening there.
[02:50:48.915 --> 02:50:50.056]  So, you're right.
[02:50:50.116 --> 02:50:54.979]  It's now being controlled by these two groups of billions of dollars.
[02:50:55.060 --> 02:50:56.621]  And that's where we're going to go in 2016.
[02:50:56.681 --> 02:51:01.284]  It's going to be again, you know, exponentially higher than it cost to run last year.
[02:51:01.304 --> 02:51:01.764]  Sure, sure.
[02:51:01.784 --> 02:51:02.925]  Well, America is actually...
[02:51:04.121 --> 02:51:04.601]  You're absolutely right.
[02:51:04.621 --> 02:51:08.024]  I mean, America is up for sale, special interest, and that's the bigger problem.
[02:51:08.044 --> 02:51:09.986]  That's why there's no difference at the very top.
[02:51:10.406 --> 02:51:14.049]  My name's Clyde, age 59, and I reside in Florence, South Carolina.
[02:51:14.289 --> 02:51:16.671]  The doctors diagnosed me as having clogged arteries.
[02:51:16.932 --> 02:51:20.154]  It felt like I was carrying heavy concrete blocks around my feet and legs.
[02:51:20.575 --> 02:51:23.237]  I started taking heart and body extract as directed.
[02:51:23.497 --> 02:51:25.959]  It is less than three weeks, and now I'm like a young man again.

[02:54:16.058 --> 02:54:18.459]  It's the final segment of the main radio broadcast.
[02:54:18.519 --> 02:54:22.780]  We know that many stations don't carry the fourth hour, but sometimes we do part of the hour or the whole hour.
[02:54:23.260 --> 02:54:24.461]  It's internet only, really.
[02:54:24.901 --> 02:54:29.162]  Infowars.com forward slash show to find the free daytime feed.
[02:54:29.543 --> 02:54:37.845]  The nighttime news is subscription, but then we post everything the next day or so up on YouTube for everybody and other platforms.
[02:54:38.306 --> 02:54:41.827]  We've got a bunch of cable systems, a bunch of satellite systems, you name it, ready.
[02:54:43.012 --> 02:54:44.173]  We're finally in the new studio.
[02:54:44.673 --> 02:54:47.114]  I'm the one that's held us up because I've been so busy with other projects.
[02:54:47.714 --> 02:54:51.196]  We're ready to start the hookups, the promotion here in just the next few months.
[02:54:51.776 --> 02:54:59.020]  I've just got to get down to it to really open it up where we can get on UHF, VHF stations all across the country, cable systems.
[02:54:59.420 --> 02:55:00.621]  We have listeners everywhere.
[02:55:01.906 --> 02:55:05.151]  In those facilities that are managers and are owners.
[02:55:05.652 --> 02:55:07.875]  And the show is about to explode.
[02:55:08.416 --> 02:55:12.221]  And with it, I think I've been procrastinating on a subconscious level because it's scary.
[02:55:12.822 --> 02:55:15.526]  Maybe why some candidates that are better don't want to run for president.
[02:55:15.807 --> 02:55:16.928]  Because you know you're going to get attacked.
[02:55:17.649 --> 02:55:19.010]  But we're about to go to the next level.
[02:55:19.551 --> 02:55:27.137]  Joe Curl is also expanding what he's doing, not just working some with DrudgeReport.com or WashingtonTimes.com, but RightRead.com.
[02:55:28.218 --> 02:55:36.664]  I wanted you to be able to finish your comment off what John Bowne said, but John, you had another point as well, then we'll get a final point from Jakari, then we're going to go to Overdrive and let you guys finish up.
[02:55:36.964 --> 02:55:37.365]  John Bowne?
[02:55:38.442 --> 02:55:49.169]  Yeah, I just want to ask Joe, because he witnessed the Iowa debacle, well, the attempt at getting the American Trust, and it seems that the public trust has been lost.
[02:55:50.090 --> 02:55:58.155]  Was Scott Walker's popularity a result of the fact that he doesn't have as much dirt on him, i.e.
[02:55:58.235 --> 02:56:01.457]  Chris Christie's traffic gate scandal, so on and so forth?
[02:56:03.038 --> 02:56:04.479]  Absolutely, and you're right.
[02:56:04.519 --> 02:56:06.000]  I think one of the things that
[02:56:06.576 --> 02:56:23.642]  That really resonated when Walker was talking was the mistrust in government, and the fact that he didn't go as far as Mitt Romney in saying 47% of people are just sucking off the government key, but what he did say was, you don't measure the government by
[02:56:25.026 --> 02:56:31.150]  By how much you get from the government, how many people are dependent on it, you measure government by how few people are dependent on it.
[02:56:31.210 --> 02:56:44.640]  So, he got a lot of applause there, he got a lot of applause when he talked about, which he did very successfully, taking on the unions in Wisconsin and winning, you know, he's won three battles, three elections in less than four years.
[02:56:45.260 --> 02:56:55.556]  So he's really been tested and a lot of the things he talked about resonated when he got to the big government, small government, intrusive government.
[02:56:57.196 --> 02:56:57.937]  Sure.
[02:56:58.197 --> 02:57:03.462]  Well, I think it's the Democrats demonizing him that makes people like him.
[02:57:03.482 --> 02:57:10.208]  I mean, when Rand Paul's getting demonized, his poll numbers go up, and then, you know, he thinks being nice to the Democrats will make him like him more.
[02:57:10.288 --> 02:57:11.889]  No, the answer is get attacked.
[02:57:12.310 --> 02:57:15.092]  That's what people see as the badge of certification.
[02:57:15.492 --> 02:57:18.575]  Final question comes from Jakari Jackson to Joseph Curl.
[02:57:18.956 --> 02:57:21.458]  Jakari, your final question or statement for Joe Curl.
[02:57:22.196 --> 02:57:30.959]  Yeah, Mr. Curl, we saw with the last presidential election, Governor Rick Perry, who I believe today said he would announce his plans, or lack thereof, come May or June.
[02:57:31.799 --> 02:57:36.841]  Last time he had a pretty tough time dealing with the Gardasil questions coming from Mrs. Bachman.
[02:57:36.861 --> 02:57:40.022]  Do you anticipate him having additional issues?
[02:57:40.082 --> 02:57:43.784]  I know you talked about the painkillers and him entering the race late.
[02:57:44.264 --> 02:57:45.484]  What's his week underbelly?
[02:57:45.524 --> 02:57:46.705]  That's a great question, Jakari.
[02:57:49.204 --> 02:57:50.545]  Well, you guys know him well there.
[02:57:50.585 --> 02:57:53.068]  You guys label him every day there in that state.
[02:57:53.128 --> 02:57:57.012]  But yeah, he's got baggage and he's got problems.
[02:57:57.052 --> 02:58:01.436]  He's been, you know, I think that, Alex, I think that's another problem that Sarah Palin has.
[02:58:01.476 --> 02:58:04.359]  I think those two both have it, is that they get pigeonholed.
[02:58:04.379 --> 02:58:05.320]  They get defined.
[02:58:05.400 --> 02:58:09.003]  And whether it's right or wrong, good or bad, they get defined.
[02:58:09.283 --> 02:58:11.666]  And unfortunately, they sort of take that definition.
[02:58:12.170 --> 02:58:13.471]  Sarah Palin has.
[02:58:13.591 --> 02:58:14.752]  I think Rick Perry has.
[02:58:15.352 --> 02:58:20.796]  And they're going to have to battle against that to get back out of it and reestablish their credentials.
[02:58:20.836 --> 02:58:22.517]  But Perry's most poised to do it.
[02:58:22.557 --> 02:58:23.958]  He's got... Oh, I agree.
[02:58:24.038 --> 02:58:26.099]  And you know, Americans love a good soap opera.
[02:58:26.399 --> 02:58:28.641]  Imagine a Rick Perry, Sarah Palin ticket.
[02:58:29.822 --> 02:58:33.064]  Wow, people... That would... I mean, the media would go after that, wouldn't they?
[02:58:34.179 --> 02:58:34.699]  Sure would.
[02:58:35.059 --> 02:58:38.081]  They would have a field day, but boy, with that stuff, they're happy.
[02:58:38.841 --> 02:58:39.321]  All right.
[02:58:39.501 --> 02:58:40.922]  RightRead.com is the website.
[02:58:40.942 --> 02:58:42.183]  Joseph Curl, thank you so much.
[02:58:43.203 --> 02:58:43.603]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:58:43.623 --> 02:58:44.203]  Appreciate it.

[03:00:18.774 --> 03:00:19.554]  Fix bayonets!
[03:00:23.036 --> 03:00:23.956]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:24.556 --> 03:00:31.559]  We are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:32.139 --> 03:00:35.820]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:36.360 --> 03:00:41.022]  Alright, I'm gonna shift gears out of the election in this last little tidbit of coverage with Jakari Jackson and John Bowne.
[03:00:42.802 --> 03:00:48.566]  Just to see what else is on their mind, what they're going to be covering on the newspieces they're producing for the nightly news, and when Jokari's hosting the news.
[03:00:49.206 --> 03:00:56.151]  I'll just say this, obviously I don't like Rick Perry for being a Democrat in the past, being anti-gun before he was pro-gun, for his Gardasil.
[03:00:56.912 --> 03:00:58.593]  But I mean, let's just be honest.
[03:00:58.653 --> 03:01:03.376]  There's no lesser of two evils, but compared to Obama or Hillary, I mean, there's just nothing worse.
[03:01:04.057 --> 03:01:05.538]  These are would-be Stalins.
[03:01:06.658 --> 03:01:07.819]  Doesn't mean I like Rick Perry.
[03:01:07.859 --> 03:01:10.601]  Doesn't mean I'm going to be all... I want Ted Cruz or Rand Paul.
[03:01:11.122 --> 03:01:12.182]  That's why they're being demonized.
[03:01:13.203 --> 03:01:17.327]  We're just discussing who's on the field in this race and looking at different ones.
[03:01:17.367 --> 03:01:18.087]  So I want to be clear.
[03:01:18.708 --> 03:01:19.809]  I get it's controlled.
[03:01:19.889 --> 03:01:20.529]  I get all that.
[03:01:20.789 --> 03:01:23.111]  I'm just... I know they're attacking the Tea Party.
[03:01:23.131 --> 03:01:24.713]  We got a chance of taking the country back.
[03:01:25.753 --> 03:01:26.394]  We can win.
[03:01:27.575 --> 03:01:29.256]  Now, finishing up with about a minute and a half each.
[03:01:30.037 --> 03:01:32.359]  John Bowne, what else do you think is the top story of the day?
[03:01:33.511 --> 03:01:37.192]  Well, I just saw this particular story here, if you guys want to bring this up on 9.
[03:01:37.853 --> 03:01:45.115]  The Cubitat shrinks an entire house into one compact cube, and that's the plan.
[03:01:45.155 --> 03:01:54.419]  They want to put us in remote control cars and remotely drive us back to our little cubes and pretend that the political theater is real and
[03:01:55.279 --> 03:02:03.485]  You know, go into a holographic reality with Microsoft's new hologram technology, and they're well on their way.
[03:02:04.626 --> 03:02:05.826]  And we're just being pushed.
[03:02:06.840 --> 03:02:12.845]  We're just being pushed into a reality that we're all aware is happening.
[03:02:13.726 --> 03:02:21.413]  It's all getting... the pace at which the news is progressing is moving faster and faster and faster every day.
[03:02:21.793 --> 03:02:23.174]  Interesting to have Joe Curl on.
[03:02:23.715 --> 03:02:34.023]  Because Drudge Reports started it with Monica Lewinsky and now we have Bill Clinton and this new sex scandal, which, you know, we're so used to at this point.
[03:02:34.804 --> 03:02:37.286]  That's right, we've gotten tyranny fatigue.
[03:02:37.666 --> 03:02:38.487]  And that's a great point.
[03:02:38.527 --> 03:02:41.089]  The new article on Infowars.com should go mega-viral.
[03:02:41.129 --> 03:02:41.769]  It probably won't.
[03:02:41.789 --> 03:02:44.672]  The UK government announced its plan to remotely control vehicles.
[03:02:45.192 --> 03:02:52.577]  And this is from the government website that they will take control and remote control your car to save the earth and to lower carbon emissions and tax you.
[03:02:53.098 --> 03:02:55.680]  I mean, they've put all this in the cars premeditatedly.
[03:02:55.700 --> 03:02:56.741]  It's complete lunacy.
[03:02:57.702 --> 03:03:03.153]  And it's like THX 1138, live in the cube, there's no room, you know, it's a wasteland outside the city.
[03:03:04.095 --> 03:03:04.837]  Jakari Jackson.
[03:03:05.899 --> 03:03:13.766]  Yeah, talking about these smart cars and so forth we've heard, I believe it was the FBI came out last year and said that these things could easily be hacked.
[03:03:13.786 --> 03:03:17.450]  We've seen several articles, I know we've done articles and videos about this recently.
[03:03:17.770 --> 03:03:23.996]  These technologies and these smart cars, and not only can they be hacked, but this information is also being given to Big Brother.
[03:03:24.056 --> 03:03:27.459]  So it's not just your cell phone or your iPad or whatever else.
[03:03:27.759 --> 03:03:31.483]  They can also get the information from your car and we also saw your smart TVs.
[03:03:31.783 --> 03:03:39.610]  That's right, the world's being designed for a government and corporate hack to run our lives, and they're telling us we're going to control your thermostat, control your car.
[03:03:39.690 --> 03:03:40.791]  It's in our face.
[03:03:40.831 --> 03:03:41.272]  Shikari?
[03:03:41.772 --> 03:03:42.793]  Oh, that's exactly right.
[03:03:42.873 --> 03:03:44.655]  You know, they're taking the choice away from me.
[03:03:45.075 --> 03:03:49.319]  So you can't decide if you want to have your house hot, if you want to drive fast, or whatever.
[03:03:49.560 --> 03:03:51.822]  And everybody says, well, it's going to make everything safer.
[03:03:52.242 --> 03:03:54.246]  Well, I don't see how it's going to make everything safer.
[03:03:54.326 --> 03:03:55.648]  You think about a computer crash.
[03:03:55.688 --> 03:03:58.713]  If you have a malfunction with your phone, it's not a big deal.
[03:03:58.733 --> 03:04:03.701]  But if you're driving 70 miles an hour and your car malfunctions, that's a pretty big circumstance.
[03:04:04.284 --> 03:04:06.966]  Well, you know how many glitches are in iPhones and stuff?
[03:04:07.006 --> 03:04:09.128]  Imagine when your car glitches out and that's already happening.
[03:04:09.148 --> 03:04:13.111]  We know government's already killed people with the remote control stuff that's been in cars for two decades.
[03:04:13.371 --> 03:04:16.353]  They've got total remote control the last four or five years with all the new cars.
[03:04:16.714 --> 03:04:18.215]  This is a serious situation.
[03:04:18.255 --> 03:04:19.156]  This is the plan.
[03:04:19.536 --> 03:04:20.617]  It is a conspiracy.
[03:04:21.137 --> 03:04:23.959]  And it's being done to enslave us, not to empower us.
[03:04:23.979 --> 03:04:26.281]  We need to wake up to it and say no.
[03:04:27.042 --> 03:04:28.303]  Any closing comments, Shikari?
[03:04:29.019 --> 03:04:31.020]  Well, I'll end with the security theater.
[03:04:31.040 --> 03:04:33.800]  We're talking about earlier the drone that flew over the White House.
[03:04:34.241 --> 03:04:40.763]  And recently we've seen, the most recent drone, we've seen people jump the White House fence, run into the White House.
[03:04:40.783 --> 03:04:44.124]  John Bowne was talking about the young lady who was shot outside the White House last year.
[03:04:44.144 --> 03:04:46.224]  They're trying to build a case to build an iron wall around it.
[03:04:46.244 --> 03:04:47.405]  Yeah, that's pretty much it.
[03:04:47.445 --> 03:04:50.025]  They put up the barricades, the barricades that people tore down.
[03:04:50.265 --> 03:04:51.626]  It's just complete security theater.
[03:04:51.666 --> 03:04:54.567]  And if they can't secure the White House, how can they secure you, John Bowne?
[03:04:54.947 --> 03:04:58.768]  And you know the warning that something big is coming soon from ISIS.
[03:04:59.048 --> 03:05:05.493]  Something bigger than 9-11, and when they blow up a city with a nuke or something, no one will point out that they were funded and created by our own government.
[03:05:05.753 --> 03:05:06.834]  Thank you so much, gentlemen.
[03:05:06.874 --> 03:05:07.774]  Great job to the crew.
[03:05:08.055 --> 03:05:09.836]  Nightly News Tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:05:11.397 --> 03:05:18.202]  If the IRS has garnished your paycheck or seized money from your bank account, you need to get professional tax help now.
