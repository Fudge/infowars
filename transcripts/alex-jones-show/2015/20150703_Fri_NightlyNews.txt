[00:00:19.707 --> 00:00:21.590]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.997]  It is Friday, July 3rd, 2015, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:29.022]  Well, we've got a big show coming up for you tonight.
[00:00:29.883 --> 00:00:31.906]  We've watched Mark Dice's video.
[00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:34.691]  You know, the people there in California had no idea.
[00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:36.971]  What they're celebrating on the 4th of July.
[00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:46.393]  So we sent Joe Biggs out to see if our friends here in the great state of Texas have any idea why we are celebrating the 4th of July.
[00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:50.674]  And then we've got a couple of really hard-hitting in-depth reports for you as well.
[00:00:51.354 --> 00:01:01.076]  I'm also going to be interviewing someone about a nice open source social network that claims to be for the people as well as another man on the street to find out
[00:01:01.516 --> 00:01:03.677]  Just what is racist these days?
[00:01:04.057 --> 00:01:06.258]  So all of that and more coming up right after this.
[00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:17.762]  I want to make this announcement now.
[00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:20.303]  It's going up as we speak a day early.
[00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:36.295]  To celebrate the birth of our country and give a big thanks to all the Info Warriors out there, we are now offering free shipping on every item shipped out of the InfoWarsStore.com warehouse.
[00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:40.379]  That's free shipping on all t-shirts, books, and DVDs.
[00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.944]  Free shipping on Molon Lave and 1776 belt buckles, which are also 25% off while supplies last.
[00:01:48.846 --> 00:01:53.448]  Free shipping on all of our InfoWarsLife.com nutraceuticals.
[00:01:53.908 --> 00:02:00.730]  If it's in the InfoWarsStore.com warehouse, it's shipping for free, all during the month of July.
[00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:13.815]  It's our way of saying thanks to the true heart and soul of this operation, who stand beside us and support us as we wage an InfoWar for liberty and freedom for all.
[00:02:14.215 --> 00:02:18.277]  InfoWarsStore.com, free shipping for the month of July.
[00:02:29.642 --> 00:02:31.563]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:40.166]  Now today we've decided to come out to the University of Texas in Austin and quiz students and find out if they actually know anything about this upcoming Independence holiday.
[00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:42.787]  You know what holiday we're celebrating this weekend?
[00:02:43.447 --> 00:02:44.047]  Fourth of July.
[00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:45.148]  I have no idea.
[00:02:45.488 --> 00:02:45.708]  What?
[00:02:46.448 --> 00:02:47.189]  July 4th, man.
[00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:48.749]  Oh, Fourth of July.
[00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:49.910]  That's a day, though.
[00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:50.530]  What's the holiday?
[00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:53.671]  What?
[00:02:53.771 --> 00:02:54.191]  No, I don't.
[00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:54.931]  Good for you.
[00:02:56.112 --> 00:02:56.732]  Probably July 4th.
[00:02:56.752 --> 00:02:58.013]  Yeah, that's probably.
[00:02:58.033 --> 00:02:58.653]  It comes after the 3rd.
[00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:01.242]  What's the holiday called?
[00:03:01.262 --> 00:03:01.683]  Independence Day.
[00:03:01.743 --> 00:03:02.143]  There you go.
[00:03:02.523 --> 00:03:04.184]  And you know who we're celebrating our independence from?
[00:03:04.224 --> 00:03:05.165]  What tyrannical government?
[00:03:07.147 --> 00:03:07.607]  Enlighten me.
[00:03:08.407 --> 00:03:09.088]  You gotta tell me.
[00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:10.229]  I gotta tell you.
[00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:11.149]  Well, wait a minute now.
[00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.330]  Independence Day.
[00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.750]  There you go.
[00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.231]  Yeah.
[00:03:13.551 --> 00:03:15.192]  And who are we celebrating our independence from?
[00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:19.335]  You guys don't know?
[00:03:19.395 --> 00:03:20.456]  Are you gonna be celebrating this holiday?
[00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.559]  Do you know why?
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.161]  And who are we celebrating our independence from?
[00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:26.362]  Britain.
[00:03:26.622 --> 00:03:27.322]  Great Britain.
[00:03:27.382 --> 00:03:28.023]  He's damn British.
[00:03:28.543 --> 00:03:28.983]  There you go.
[00:03:29.003 --> 00:03:30.124]  And what kind of coats do they wear?
[00:03:30.664 --> 00:03:30.965]  Red.
[00:03:31.185 --> 00:03:32.065]  Yeah, they're red coats.
[00:03:32.426 --> 00:03:33.486]  Do you like those coats?
[00:03:33.686 --> 00:03:35.027]  No, I think they're ugly as anything.
[00:03:35.868 --> 00:03:36.268]  Great Britain.
[00:03:36.968 --> 00:03:37.569]  Britain.
[00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:38.129]  What?
[00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.569]  Look at you.
[00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.310]  Britain.
[00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:42.272]  I don't know.
[00:03:42.752 --> 00:03:44.333]  I'm from Mexico, so I know nothing.
[00:03:45.274 --> 00:03:46.634]  We're all from Mexico.
[00:03:47.815 --> 00:03:49.256]  Let me think.
[00:03:49.676 --> 00:03:50.137]  Oh, man.
[00:03:51.283 --> 00:03:54.164]  Our independence.
[00:03:54.264 --> 00:03:55.445]  Isn't it Mexico?
[00:03:56.525 --> 00:03:57.566]  Mexico or Spain, isn't it?
[00:03:58.046 --> 00:03:59.826]  I'm gonna say Mexico.
[00:04:00.947 --> 00:04:01.987]  You put me on the spot.
[00:04:02.207 --> 00:04:03.668]  Okay, I'll give you a couple choices if you want.
[00:04:03.688 --> 00:04:04.768]  You ready?
[00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:06.069]  Okay, give me some choices.
[00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.449]  China?
[00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.189]  No.
[00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.850]  Mexico?
[00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.170]  Yes.
[00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.450]  Great Britain?
[00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.730]  No.
[00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.271]  Okay.
[00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:13.292]  And what year do we declare independence?
[00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:17.413]  19... Is that right?
[00:04:17.453 --> 00:04:17.773]  Am I right?
[00:04:17.793 --> 00:04:17.813]  1980s?
[00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:18.213]  Is that right?
[00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:18.213]  1989?
[00:04:18.253 --> 00:04:18.694]  1989 from Mexico.
[00:04:18.734 --> 00:04:18.854]  What?
[00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:19.534]  I don't know, man.
[00:04:19.594 --> 00:04:19.694]  1600s, 1700s, 1800s?
[00:04:19.714 --> 00:04:19.734]  1600s.
[00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:20.095]  Okay, 1600s.
[00:04:20.175 --> 00:04:20.315]  Oh, man.
[00:04:20.335 --> 00:04:20.695]  Yeah, I can't do... 1776.
[00:04:20.735 --> 00:04:21.836]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:04:21.876 --> 00:04:24.298]  Let me get a high five real quick.
[00:04:36.494 --> 00:04:36.974]  1744.
[00:04:36.554 --> 00:04:36.974]  1744?
[00:04:36.614 --> 00:04:36.974]  Is it?
[00:04:37.135 --> 00:04:37.235]  Yeah.
[00:04:37.595 --> 00:04:40.157]  I'm letting you answer.
[00:04:40.177 --> 00:04:41.358]  I think it's 1744.
[00:04:41.458 --> 00:04:41.598]  Okay.
[00:04:41.618 --> 00:04:41.598]  1796.
[00:04:41.638 --> 00:04:41.998]  No, 1776!
[00:04:42.398 --> 00:04:44.260]  That's what I meant.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.723]  Yeah, that's when my university was founded, so I get the two confused.
[00:04:48.743 --> 00:04:49.723]  Two unprinted dates, yeah.
[00:04:50.384 --> 00:04:52.806]  Do you know what year we got our independence?
[00:04:52.966 --> 00:04:53.086]  Oh, no.
[00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:53.266]  I don't.
[00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:53.786]  Okay.
[00:04:54.147 --> 00:04:53.786]  1776.
[00:04:54.187 --> 00:04:54.747]  There you go.
[00:04:54.767 --> 00:04:55.227]  A long time ago.
[00:04:55.247 --> 00:04:56.148]  1600s, 1700s, 1800s, 1900s.
[00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.450]  Uh, 1600s.
[00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.171]  Okay, give me a day then.
[00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:07.351]  Oh, 1776.
[00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:08.631]  There you go.
[00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:13.252]  19... No, yeah, it was like, I don't know, 1925?
[00:05:13.332 --> 00:05:14.092]  I don't know.
[00:05:14.132 --> 00:05:19.894]  Alright, and what document did we write and come up with on the- Declaration of Independence!
[00:05:20.174 --> 00:05:24.715]  So you're saying that sarcastically, but you have to understand there's a lot of people who keep saying Mexico and things like that.
[00:05:24.775 --> 00:05:25.135]  Really?
[00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:25.875]  Who are from here, yeah.
[00:05:27.496 --> 00:05:28.176]  I have no idea.
[00:05:28.872 --> 00:05:30.975]  The... It's already got the name in it, kind of.
[00:05:30.995 --> 00:05:32.397]  Gotta add a couple other things.
[00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:34.060]  The Declaration of Independence.
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.061]  You got that one.
[00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:36.504]  The American Constitution.
[00:05:37.124 --> 00:05:37.365]  Okay.
[00:05:37.705 --> 00:05:37.805]  No.
[00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:39.531]  The Constitution.
[00:05:39.652 --> 00:05:45.035]  It's called the Independence Day, so what goes before independence to make this... Declaration of Independence.
[00:05:45.055 --> 00:05:45.775]  There you go.
[00:05:46.156 --> 00:05:47.376]  The Declaration of Independence.
[00:05:47.677 --> 00:05:49.358]  Okay, do you know any of the names of the people who signed it?
[00:05:49.598 --> 00:05:51.359]  John Hancock was the first line.
[00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:53.020]  She knows all the governments.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.781]  You got any other names?
[00:05:55.341 --> 00:05:59.504]  Yeah, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, all the founding fathers, you know, right?
[00:05:59.524 --> 00:06:00.225]  Don't you know?
[00:06:00.345 --> 00:06:00.765]  Look at this.
[00:06:02.266 --> 00:06:04.887]  I remember Thomas, or something like that.
[00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:07.875]  I don't know.
[00:06:07.895 --> 00:06:09.579]  Who's the guy who wears the hat?
[00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:09.900]  No, no.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.381]  He died.
[00:06:10.481 --> 00:06:10.882]  Nevermind.
[00:06:13.533 --> 00:06:13.973]  No, I don't.
[00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:14.834]  I have no idea.
[00:06:15.254 --> 00:06:20.297]  James Madison, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, maybe.
[00:06:20.377 --> 00:06:20.997]  Look at this guy!
[00:06:21.017 --> 00:06:22.698]  He needs to say where you're from one more time.
[00:06:22.898 --> 00:06:23.639]  Saudi Arabia.
[00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:31.844]  Well, I mean, I know that it was authored by Thomas Jefferson, who is also the founder of the University of Virginia, one of the most important universities in this country.
[00:06:32.624 --> 00:06:37.147]  But yeah, I suppose John Hancock, a bunch of other dudes.
[00:06:37.227 --> 00:06:39.388]  I should know, I watch National Treasure a lot.
[00:06:39.408 --> 00:06:42.610]  Do you know any of the people who signed it in 1989 for Mexico?
[00:06:43.171 --> 00:06:45.113]  Thomas Jefferson, right?
[00:06:45.253 --> 00:06:45.453]  Yeah.
[00:06:45.953 --> 00:06:47.254]  And George Washington.
[00:06:47.535 --> 00:06:47.995]  You're on it.
[00:06:48.115 --> 00:06:49.256]  There's no fool in you.
[00:06:49.276 --> 00:06:49.737]  Look at you.
[00:06:50.217 --> 00:06:50.978]  Knowing your stuff.
[00:06:51.078 --> 00:06:51.418]  Mexico 1989.
[00:07:02.048 --> 00:07:09.877]  We celebrate the 4th of July as a reminder of earning our independence from a tyrannical and oppressive government.
[00:07:10.057 --> 00:07:16.585]  Just a reminder to the Obama administration, there's plenty of room on the calendar for another holiday.
[00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:41.895]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:07:42.355 --> 00:07:52.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:56.110]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:01.355]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:08:01.755 --> 00:08:07.961]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.

[00:08:37.796 --> 00:08:43.238]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:08:43.558 --> 00:08:57.983]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.

[00:09:45.071 --> 00:09:49.459]  Jade Helm 15, a military exercise of grand scale.
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:57.194]  The military claims the exercise is for overseas training, yet three of these United States have been listed as hostile.
[00:09:58.103 --> 00:10:04.966]  The term mastering the human domain reveals to us that Jade Helm 15 is more than just a military exercise.
[00:10:05.527 --> 00:10:18.113]  It's also an exercise of the new field of geospatial intelligence, using human domain analytics to map the politics and thoughts of any nation, state, city, right down to the individual.
[00:10:19.082 --> 00:10:20.303]  Jade Helm 15.
[00:10:20.743 --> 00:10:25.205]  That's what the United States Army is calling a large-scale military exercise.
[00:10:25.665 --> 00:10:29.907]  Special Operations Command will be training with other armed units beginning in July.
[00:10:30.688 --> 00:10:40.453]  In a recent InfoWars.com report, Master the Human Domain, the domestic plan behind Jade Helm, we break down what the Jade Helm logo refers to.
[00:10:41.713 --> 00:10:46.603]  In brief, a new discipline in intelligence has been at center stage for the past decade.
[00:10:47.144 --> 00:10:49.047]  Activity-Based Intelligence, or ABI.
[00:10:52.344 --> 00:11:21.506]  According to TrajectoryMagazine.com, the human domain or human dimension, which is a vital and integral part of ABI, is defined as the presence, activities, including transactions, both physical and virtual, culture, social structure, organization, networks and relationships, motivations, intent, vulnerabilities, and capabilities of humans, single or groups, across all domains of the operational environment, space, air,
[00:11:21.966 --> 00:11:23.727]  Maritime, ground, and cyber.
[00:11:24.487 --> 00:11:33.071]  This article goes on to say that the focus on mastering the human domain was born out of a merging of three already existing disciplines of intelligence.
[00:11:34.132 --> 00:11:47.377]  That may be the case for this branding of this idea, but the exercise of mapping the human domain right down to the individual is a long-standing institutionalized strategy that has been going on for well over 100 years.
[00:11:50.373 --> 00:12:06.120]  What reason would the United States government have to invest so much time, resources, and money in order to pinpoint exact pockets of thought in a country founded on free thought, expression, and most of all outspoken words against its own government?
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:14.944]  During his famous farewell address, Eisenhower warned the American people of an imminent and internal threat, a scientific elite,
[00:12:15.717 --> 00:12:27.704]  We must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite.
[00:12:29.025 --> 00:12:38.529]  The title, Scientific Elite, to most Americans might seem like nothing more than ordinary intangible rhetoric, typically thrown around by politicians during their speeches.
[00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:43.051]  This time, however, Eisenhower was not speaking in abstractions.
[00:12:43.651 --> 00:12:45.892]  There actually is a scientific elite.
[00:12:48.873 --> 00:12:52.075]  Jade Helm 15 is anything but the American way.
[00:12:52.635 --> 00:12:57.257]  It's a domestic scientific control grid whose purpose is domination and control.
[00:12:58.757 --> 00:13:07.348]  A technological infrastructure for authoritarian political control is not the end goal, but a means to that end of eugenics.
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:33.970]  The term eugenics, coined by Charles Darwin's half-cousin Sir Francis Galton in 1883, is a science dedicated to the engineering of the human genome by selectively breeding those humans with what they consider to be desirable qualities, such as intelligence, athleticism, etc., and eliminating those humans without these attributes and all races of humans unlike their own.
[00:13:35.143 --> 00:13:38.104]  Out of this, race theory and race science was born.
[00:13:38.845 --> 00:13:49.910]  Karl Pearson, a protege of Galton, assembled a biometrics laboratory based out of the University of London in 1907 in order to collect data about people mostly based on race.
[00:13:50.410 --> 00:14:01.155]  He also published a journal entitled Biometrica, which became very influential with American scientists and financiers who were becoming extremely interested in the concept of eugenics.
[00:14:01.895 --> 00:14:07.497]  As this movement grew in popularity, top American industrialists threw their money into the game.
[00:14:07.817 --> 00:14:12.598]  Carnegie, Harriman, and Rockefeller were among the top contributors.
[00:14:13.258 --> 00:14:30.783]  California became the eugenics capital of the world, while on the East Coast, Cold Spring Harbor Research Facility, located on Long Island, was collecting and storing biometric information on average Americans in order to begin the elimination of families as well as entire races of people.
[00:14:31.903 --> 00:14:44.613]  Through the efforts of the California eugenicist, mostly through written pamphlets and endowments mostly from the Rockefellers and Harriman, the eugenics movement found a second home in Germany in the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.
[00:14:45.934 --> 00:14:59.164]  This pre-World War II, well-funded, international scientific community based around the eugenics movement was cementing its place as a standard in human academia when World War II broke out in full scale.
[00:15:00.373 --> 00:15:05.835]  The then CEO of IBM, Thomas J. Watson, worked hand-in-hand with Nazi Germany.
[00:15:06.395 --> 00:15:26.563]  In 1933, it was Watson who enthusiastically helped the Nazi plan and funded their national census, which according to historian Edwin Black in his 2001 publication, IBM and the Holocaust, the 1933 census with design help and tabulation services provided by IBM through its German subsidiary.
[00:15:26.803 --> 00:15:27.524]  We're good to go!
[00:15:47.606 --> 00:15:57.143]  A similar and frighteningly more advanced version of this eugenics-based biometrics program is being tested right now under the name Jade Helm 15.
[00:15:58.823 --> 00:16:06.346]  While the term eugenics is no longer used in the mainstream openly, the practice of eugenics is still around and stronger than ever.
[00:16:06.687 --> 00:16:12.769]  Jade Helm 15 exercises the next generation of technology in the political domination arena.
[00:16:13.089 --> 00:16:22.574]  It is simply another technological step beyond the Cold Springs Harbor Research Facility's biometrics program or Thomas J. Watson's census of Germany.
[00:16:23.234 --> 00:16:30.639]  And their disciplines developed during the eugenics heyday in the early 20th century are still being practiced and advanced today.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:48.172]  Mandatory toxic vaccines, abortion, family courts, contaminated water, and of course biometrics are just a few of the branches that grew out of the original eugenics trunk, still present and dominating over our society today.
[00:16:49.474 --> 00:17:03.146]  In 2010, the GEOINT Symposium and Annual Geointelligence, Geospatial, and Activity-Based Intelligence Conference held a presentation entitled, Mastering the Human Domain.
[00:17:03.707 --> 00:17:08.311]  Geospatial intelligence and human geography were the main talking points.
[00:17:09.252 --> 00:17:12.555]  Jade Helm is born and begins to take form.
[00:17:13.834 --> 00:17:20.878]  The human domain encompasses the totality of the physical, cultural, and social environments that influence human behavior.
[00:17:21.378 --> 00:17:28.563]  Explained Admiral McRaven, success in this domain won't be achieved by traditional ground, naval, or air forces.
[00:17:29.243 --> 00:17:38.929]  Instead, success in the human domain will depend upon understanding the human terrain and establishing trust with those individuals who occupy that space.
[00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:45.191]  The goal is to see if groups of these special forces can move around the civilian population without being noticed.
[00:17:45.211 --> 00:17:49.192]  You know, blend in so they can place themselves in strategic positions.
[00:17:49.732 --> 00:17:51.313]  McRaven continued by saying,
[00:17:59.133 --> 00:18:16.702]  A living active map where human beings are movable real-time landmarks and everyone's personal thoughts, feelings, medical information, belief systems, history, basically every shred of information about the individuals in any region on that map will make up the terrain.
[00:18:17.203 --> 00:18:21.365]  When mastering the human domain, the special operators are the masters.
[00:18:21.825 --> 00:18:24.927]  They are the key that turns this whole machine on.
[00:18:26.531 --> 00:18:46.328]  And regardless of whether the military calls this project Activity-Based Intelligence, ABI, Geospatial Intelligence, coupled with Human Domain Analytics, what we are looking at is the nexus between private tech firms, homeland security and law enforcement, domestic surveillance, and the domestic use of special forces.
[00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.691]  How is any of this legal?
[00:18:50.172 --> 00:18:53.835]  How is any of this not a violation of the Fourth Amendment?
[00:18:55.583 --> 00:19:05.529]  In this animated short, Plandopolis, scarcity and poverty are the norm, and the entire population is dependent on smart technology in order to survive.
[00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:24.040]  In this piece of predictive programming, we are introduced to what is now known as the Internet of Things, a world of smart machines that are equipped with sensors that will be able to determine all of your physical activities in real time as you interact with machines and objects in your everyday life.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:24.941]  I don't know.
[00:19:41.141 --> 00:19:42.902]  As well as the virtual world.
[00:19:43.463 --> 00:19:52.209]  Once the operators of Jade Helm fully master the human domain, these social controllers can then proceed with the next stage of their engineered plan.
[00:19:52.529 --> 00:19:56.912]  Local roundup exercises have been videotaped in South Beach, Florida.
[00:19:57.973 --> 00:20:08.440]  Our own InfoWars reporters David Knight and Joe Biggs visited a top-secret military training facility to prepare for urban missions here in the United States.
[00:20:10.242 --> 00:20:19.010]  Newcomers are making their move, like data mining tech company Palantir, who have been working with the military-industrial complex for years.
[00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:28.238]  Bilderberg member regulars Peter Thiel and Alex Karp founded Palantir using venture capital money from the CIA's In-Q-Tel.
[00:20:28.918 --> 00:20:32.181]  And many more startups like this one are on the way.
[00:20:32.802 --> 00:20:37.146]  Palantir will now be expanding from the battlefield to the VA.
[00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:55.061]  IBM Watson Health Cloud, which is now being phased into A Doctors when they're diagnosing patients, will be able to sift through millions of available medical documents a second and form a medical opinion using technologies provided by Palantir.
[00:20:56.479 --> 00:21:12.690]  The Watson Health Cloud will not only have access to documents, but it will track, trace, and store people's medical conditions in live time via the latest fitness wristbands, eyewatches, etc., which upload your vitals via wireless internet.
[00:21:13.471 --> 00:21:17.574]  Watson will eliminate the doctor's responsibility of misdiagnosis.
[00:21:18.334 --> 00:21:21.176]  Blame can be put on the computer or its programmers.
[00:21:21.737 --> 00:21:23.919]  But who exactly are these programmers?
[00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:28.762]  In a system like this, responsibility can be deferred indefinitely.
[00:21:28.782 --> 00:21:46.357]  A society that has put all of its trust in the recommendations of the IBM computer Watson, which can autonomously recommend diagnosis and recommend treatment with no responsibility to anyone, and advise that certain patients receive no treatment whatsoever.
[00:21:47.443 --> 00:21:51.486]  In other words, a fully automated robotic death panel.
[00:21:52.547 --> 00:21:57.411]  One specific demographic is directly in the crosshairs of this new threat, U.S.
[00:21:57.451 --> 00:21:57.911]  veterans.
[00:21:58.992 --> 00:22:04.476]  According to an IBM News release from December 16, 2014, the U.S.
[00:22:04.516 --> 00:22:15.705]  Department of Veteran Affairs, VA, is using Watson technology and a pilot to assist physicians in helping accelerate the process of evidence-based medical decision making.
[00:22:16.798 --> 00:22:29.526]  A tech startup, Recorded Future, that uses a system of filtering through and classifying open source data, demonstrated their predictive analytics capability during the 2012 GEOINT conference.
[00:22:30.247 --> 00:22:35.550]  Trajectory Magazine reports, the concept is to find people who are talking about the future.
[00:22:36.151 --> 00:22:39.133]  Vice President for Recorded Future, Matt Kodema says,
[00:22:39.833 --> 00:22:41.794]  We can basically roll back the clock.
[00:22:42.154 --> 00:22:46.195]  We know that this particular did happen in this time at this place.
[00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:50.176]  Now let's go back a week before that and look at the publications.
[00:22:50.636 --> 00:22:52.217]  Who was predicting that accurately?
[00:22:52.637 --> 00:22:53.157]  Who wasn't?
[00:22:54.037 --> 00:23:08.142]  Add this layer of predictive analytics on top of the other human domain analytic and you begin to get an idea of the scope and range of the overarching, inescapable control grid these scientific controllers are constructing.
[00:23:09.321 --> 00:23:22.108]  At the same GEOINT conference in 2012, Jeff Jonas, the Chief Scientist for IBM Entity Analytics and an IBM Fellow, talked about the potential for open source data utilization.
[00:23:22.569 --> 00:23:29.372]  He said, in typical IBM tradition, space, time, travel data is the ultimate biometric.
[00:23:30.193 --> 00:23:37.257]  It seems that IBM and the scientific elite's perspective shifted from the master race to mastering the human domain.
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:48.924]  So we probably won't see doors kicked in and military trucks shipping political opponents to their demise during this summer's Jade Helm 15 military procedure.
[00:23:49.324 --> 00:23:58.168]  However, as Brzezinski states in Between Two Ages, the technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society.
[00:23:58.908 --> 00:24:08.452]  Just like Watson's census was not the end sought by the Nazis, neither is Jade Helm 15 an end, but a means to a historically predictable end.
[00:24:11.038 --> 00:24:24.087]  We must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific, technological elite.
[00:24:24.487 --> 00:24:35.195]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:24:37.455 --> 00:24:41.161]  This is Jakari Jackson reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:25:00.785 --> 00:25:08.947]  About a year and a half ago, Anthony Gucciardi just said, man, I just did a Dr. Gribbs liver cleanse, the one he recommends, and he's developing this proprietary stuff he's testing on himself right now.
[00:25:09.047 --> 00:25:09.788]  You really ought to do it.
[00:25:09.888 --> 00:25:11.768]  The results are dramatic after six days.
[00:25:11.988 --> 00:25:13.709]  I'm like, no way, no way I'm doing it.
[00:25:13.849 --> 00:25:17.010]  I don't believe that there's giant black or green balls in my gallbladder.
[00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.050]  This is how ignorant I am.
[00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.310]  And he's like, look at it online.
[00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:20.471]  I'm not looking at it online.
[00:25:20.531 --> 00:25:21.511]  Stuff like that grosses me out.
[00:25:21.531 --> 00:25:22.111]  I don't want to go there.
[00:25:22.191 --> 00:25:24.812]  Well, finally, about six months ago, they convinced me to do it.
[00:25:24.952 --> 00:25:29.094]  I personally think everybody should go through liver cleansing if you haven't done one.
[00:25:29.154 --> 00:25:30.455]  Results speak for themselves.
[00:25:30.515 --> 00:25:37.918]  I mean, hundreds of thousands of people have done this, and it dates back even a thousand years, drinking oils to cleanse and purge the liver.
[00:25:38.419 --> 00:25:43.241]  Actually, the Greeks over in India with Ayurvedic medicine have done it the same way.
[00:25:43.301 --> 00:25:49.084]  But how it works is, what you should do, and this is what our proprietary research led us to do back
[00:25:49.224 --> 00:25:49.304]  Yes.
[00:26:04.738 --> 00:26:09.061]  The high quality proprietary liver trex developed by Dr. Grip that we've private labeled through him.
[00:26:09.181 --> 00:26:13.205]  And it's extremely strong, extremely concentrated, extremely high powered.
[00:26:13.265 --> 00:26:19.129]  You combine that with the Oxy Powder, oxygen based intestinal cleanser, dietary supplement, clinically tested.
[00:26:19.189 --> 00:26:22.192]  We have them discounted at the lowest price you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:26:22.292 --> 00:26:23.873]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:26:24.093 --> 00:26:26.895]  Obviously folks should probably talk to their healthcare provider before they do this.
[00:26:27.055 --> 00:26:32.480]  This is one of the single biggest results, if not the biggest I've ever seen in my life, literally in a six day period.
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.041]  This is something anybody can do.
[00:26:34.381 --> 00:26:37.382]  Obviously, the literature is well known on what liver cleanses do.
[00:26:37.442 --> 00:26:39.323]  This is the best one out there from our research.
[00:26:39.443 --> 00:26:43.324]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:26:44.464 --> 00:26:50.606]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:26:50.686 --> 00:26:53.347]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:26:53.367 --> 00:27:00.149]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:27:00.409 --> 00:27:03.230]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:04.691]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:07.032]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:27:07.092 --> 00:27:09.614]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:35.151]  I want to make this announcement now.
[00:27:35.171 --> 00:27:36.191]  It's going up as we speak, a day early.
[00:27:51.383 --> 00:28:04.091]  To celebrate the birth of our country and give a big thanks to all the InfoWarriors out there, we are now offering free shipping on every item shipped out of the InfoWarsStore.com warehouse.
[00:28:04.471 --> 00:28:08.173]  That's free shipping on all t-shirts, books, and DVDs.
[00:28:08.693 --> 00:28:14.697]  Free shipping on Molon Labe and 1776 belt buckles, which are also 25% off while supplies last.
[00:28:16.658 --> 00:28:21.261]  Free shipping on all of our InfoWarsLife.com nutraceuticals.
[00:28:21.702 --> 00:28:28.547]  If it's in the InfoWarsStore.com warehouse, it's shipping for free, all during the month of July.
[00:28:29.047 --> 00:28:41.617]  It's our way of saying thanks to the true heart and soul of this operation, who stand beside us and support us as we wage an InfoWar for liberty and freedom for all.
[00:28:42.037 --> 00:28:46.080]  InfoWarsStore.com, free shipping for the month of July.
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:54.265]  We celebrate the 4th of July as a reminder of earning our independence from a tyrannical and oppressive government.
[00:28:54.465 --> 00:29:01.009]  Just a reminder to the Obama administration, there's plenty of room on the calendar for another holiday.
[00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:20.876]  Have you ever been accused of just not being politically correct enough?
[00:29:21.016 --> 00:29:27.206]  Or do you feel like you're just a little out of touch in this new, perpetually offended USA?
[00:29:27.687 --> 00:29:31.232]  Well, that might be a case of unconscious bias.
[00:29:33.613 --> 00:29:37.697]  Much research points to the widespread existence of unconscious bias.
[00:29:38.018 --> 00:29:40.020]  But then there are the unconscious biases.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.361]  Unconscious bias.
[00:29:41.601 --> 00:29:43.683]  Implicit racial bias.
[00:29:44.324 --> 00:29:50.630]  There's a new trend, a new term, unconscious bias, or as it's sometimes called, implicit bias.
[00:29:51.091 --> 00:29:56.236]  That surprise and the behaviors associated with it are the product of something called unconscious bias.
[00:29:56.673 --> 00:30:07.539]  Everyone from government workers to private employees are all being compelled to take a good look at their unconscious minds and the hidden biases that lurk beneath.
[00:30:08.419 --> 00:30:16.143]  Experts claim that biases prevent employees from being productive and creative, while it hinders government employees' ability to make sound decisions.
[00:30:16.743 --> 00:30:25.988]  If the idea of the establishment evaluating your most hidden thoughts and emotions to determine if you're politically correct enough to function, that doesn't sit well with you, you're not alone.
[00:30:27.253 --> 00:30:34.901]  It's easy to dismiss the importance of the subject of the unconscious mind as simply a concept used by psychiatrists to better understand their patients.
[00:30:35.802 --> 00:30:43.910]  But we live in a world where you can't turn your head without being bombarded by some advertiser's attempt to influence our unconscious minds and behaviors.
[00:30:44.491 --> 00:31:06.420]  On top of the excessive attempts to manipulate our behavior through subliminal suggestions in the media, the psychiatric profession also serves the establishment as a convenient way to sidestep our entire judicial system with tools like the Hare Psychopath Checklist Revise, a PCLR, that they can use to directly incarcerate whoever they label as institutional.
[00:31:07.537 --> 00:31:11.560]  Criminal profiling has been a popular establishment tool since World War II.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:30.632]  According to historian Gary Lachman, who stated in his 2010 book Jung the Mystic, it was Carl Jung himself who, in 1942, met with the one and only Alan Dulles and began a, quote, experimental marriage between espionage and psychology, unquote, involving the psychological profile of political and military leaders.
[00:31:30.873 --> 00:31:31.433]  Shortly after,
[00:31:31.693 --> 00:31:39.740]  Psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer submitted to the OSS, the predecessor to the CIA, a report that probed the psychology of Adolf Hitler.
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:45.764]  Thus the institution of psychological profiling was born, and it has grown into an uncontrollable beast.
[00:31:46.701 --> 00:32:02.041]  We've all heard the controversy over the TSA profiling suspected terrorists or threats and how absolutely absurd it is to believe that the TSA can actually be trained to detect a person's inner agenda just by glancing at them in a busy airport terminal for about five seconds.
[00:32:03.188 --> 00:32:08.533]  Which brings us to the latest trend in psychological tyranny, the unconscious bias examination.
[00:32:09.133 --> 00:32:11.635]  The term was virtually unknown on the web just a few months ago.
[00:32:12.216 --> 00:32:15.358]  Now there are literally hundreds of articles on the subject.
[00:32:16.159 --> 00:32:23.946]  The articles are mostly pressuring large corporations to begin subjecting their employees to this degrading, unproven, intrusive requirement.
[00:32:24.486 --> 00:32:29.591]  And of course the government is already forcing its own workers to evaluate their own unconscious minds.
[00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:38.276]  On March 19, 2015, the Washington Times published an article entitled, Federal Workers Ordered to Probe Their Unconscious Bias.
[00:32:38.656 --> 00:32:39.757]  They say, a top U.S.
[00:32:39.837 --> 00:32:52.549]  Forest Service executive told his employees to probe their own unconscious bias on everything from race and sexuality to the disabled and fat people, asking them to use an unproven assessment tool to explore their feelings.
[00:32:53.109 --> 00:33:04.503]  The online test, which the Forest Management Director urged other agency directors to use as well, specifically warns of problems when it's taken outside of the safeguards of a research institution.
[00:33:05.044 --> 00:33:09.269]  Users are also told to be careful about how far to go in interpreting the results.
[00:33:10.259 --> 00:33:23.382]  In an AP article on March 9th of this year, titled Police Agencies Line Up to Learn About Unconscious Bias, we find that police from all over the country are now being flown to LA to a place called the Museum of Tolerance.
[00:33:23.803 --> 00:33:32.905]  There they can learn how to evaluate and control their unconscious bias before making any potentially biased, therefore bad or perhaps fatal decisions.
[00:33:33.385 --> 00:33:55.935]  The head of the Justice Department program that offers this training to police departments says, without even a hint of irony in talking about the unconscious bias of the police, this is one tool that police leaders are using to help really ensure their agencies engage in conscious policing, according to the head of the Justice Department's Community Oriented Policing Services program, the one offering the training.
[00:33:56.935 --> 00:34:04.178]  Nobody can argue that conscious policing is a good thing, and in the midst of a tense situation, a conscious clear head is a requirement.
[00:34:04.899 --> 00:34:06.840]  But that's not what they're talking about.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:12.622]  Some researchers caution that there's not enough evidence to show that implicit bias training is effective.
[00:34:14.223 --> 00:34:24.708]  As others have pointed out, this could potentially endanger officers by making them slower to recognize threats for fear of being called biased, or it could endanger the public by making them shoot even quicker.
[00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:33.628]  And they point out the training's benefits could quickly disappear when an officer gets back into the real world, or it could even increase racial bias in the long term.
[00:34:35.249 --> 00:34:43.095]  FBI Director James Comey said recently that rifts between police and communities can't be fully bridged until we acknowledge unconscious bias.
[00:34:44.536 --> 00:34:48.638]  Much research points to the widespread existence of unconscious bias.
[00:34:48.898 --> 00:34:50.880]  If we can't help our latent biases,
[00:34:52.153 --> 00:34:56.358]  We can help our behavior in response to those instinctive reactions.
[00:34:57.039 --> 00:35:00.323]  What about holding police accountable for their actions?
[00:35:01.224 --> 00:35:09.114]  Wouldn't that be a better start than an abstract examination into a police officer's mind that might impair his reaction time, putting him in grave danger?
[00:35:10.486 --> 00:35:23.815]  There's also a huge push for the private sector to utilize this technique for increased creativity and productivity, and not surprisingly, to root out any potential gender issues that are floating around just below the surface.
[00:35:24.875 --> 00:35:32.637]  Administering an exam based on unproven techniques that can affect a person's employment status sounds like a recipe for disaster.
[00:35:33.157 --> 00:35:40.699]  Let's not forget about the other possible consequences of introducing a compulsory system and probing a person's unconscious mind in an inappropriate setting.
[00:35:41.099 --> 00:35:42.600]  In this case, the workplace.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:51.327]  Forcing people to examine their minds in this way when they're not prepared in this kind of a setting can involuntarily surface repressed emotions, memories, trauma.
[00:35:51.628 --> 00:36:04.560]  Without the aid of a trained professional to help deal correctly with these lost feelings, a person can experience what is known as re-traumatization and cause a person to go into deep depression, nervous breakdown, or even suicide.
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:05.520]  And finally,
[00:36:06.221 --> 00:36:10.587]  This kind of testing at work opens the possibilities for singling people out.
[00:36:11.308 --> 00:36:20.639]  If the police training facility called the Museum of Tolerance doesn't raise the Orwellian eyebrow, just think about the fact that the unthought is still a thought crime.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:31.393]  Someone can be labeled, stigmatized, have their life ruined, all based on a test that, without proof, alleges to detect hidden thoughts, feelings, and motivations.
[00:36:31.753 --> 00:36:40.184]  Just a few months back, then Attorney General Eric Holder used unconscious bias to describe racial bias present in the Ferguson police force.
[00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:53.084]  Our review of the evidence found no, no alternative explanation for the disproportionate impact on African American residents other than implicit and explicit racial bias.
[00:36:53.897 --> 00:36:59.601]  It's clear that the establishment has been toying with this new tool for a little while, and they're rolling it out now.
[00:37:00.102 --> 00:37:15.212]  Considering how abusive the government is with other methods provided to them by the psychiatric profession, imagine how much more abusive it will get when everywhere you go, you will not only be judged for your actions and thoughts, but also judged for thoughts that others claim you have the potential for having.
[00:37:16.013 --> 00:37:29.483]  It would be a mistake not to observe how the media is bombarding us with headlines associating the term unconscious bias mostly with gender bias, just as Hillary Clinton begins her campaign using gender bias as her campaign crutch.
[00:37:30.123 --> 00:37:38.429]  Remember, Hillary is proposing government fun camps for adults to go to and be re-educated into a functional member of society.
[00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:41.592]  The type without any unauthorized biases.
[00:37:42.459 --> 00:37:46.362]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[00:37:47.063 --> 00:37:54.629]  The unconscious bias exam might just be the perfect tool for singling out anyone they want and dragging them away into a government camp.
[00:37:56.277 --> 00:38:05.944]  So even though we could incarcerate the wrong person, we could destroy due process, we could have an all-out Orwellian tyranny, many experts say there could be something positive in this for society.
[00:38:06.225 --> 00:38:08.326]  Well, I've got an idea of what we could do that would be positive.
[00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:13.650]  How about we use it to screen potential leaders to see if they're psychologically sound?
[00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:16.072]  After all, we don't want our president to be a psychopath.
[00:38:16.432 --> 00:38:18.654]  We could even call it the Dr. Strangelove test.
[00:38:19.194 --> 00:38:21.176]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:38:31.539 --> 00:38:32.480]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.201]  Most of you know me as a syndicated radio host and documentary filmmaker.
[00:38:35.741 --> 00:38:40.484]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I was only 21 years old.
[00:38:41.084 --> 00:38:50.289]  And if you go back 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I jogged 6 miles every other day, I lifted weights 5 days a week, I could swim 2-3 miles.
[00:38:51.029 --> 00:38:53.931]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[00:38:54.891 --> 00:38:56.472]  I started an access television show.
[00:38:56.912 --> 00:39:00.293]  Shortly after that, I was able to get a local radio show.
[00:39:00.773 --> 00:39:05.575]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[00:39:06.175 --> 00:39:09.056]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[00:39:09.496 --> 00:39:15.198]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[00:39:16.417 --> 00:39:23.622]  It was my friend Tommy Pallotta, a film producer, he said, Alex, you're killing yourself not caring about your body.
[00:39:23.943 --> 00:39:25.884]  You're going to end up having a heart attack when you're 50 years old.
[00:39:26.184 --> 00:39:26.925]  You got to stop.
[00:39:27.285 --> 00:39:32.249]  And so I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[00:39:32.649 --> 00:39:35.071]  The first three years I lost about 25 pounds.
[00:39:35.531 --> 00:39:36.532]  It was super hard.
[00:39:36.892 --> 00:39:41.796]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[00:39:42.096 --> 00:39:49.443]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Group for InfoWarsLife.com, the results were incredible.
[00:39:49.904 --> 00:39:55.870]  The problem was, though, I'd never been a vitamin and mineral and supplement taker before, so I kept forgetting to do it.
[00:39:56.190 --> 00:40:00.574]  Just a month and a half ago, I asked the crew to take a photo of me in the same lighting
[00:40:01.235 --> 00:40:11.241]  To see what I could do in just a month and a half by taking the Oxy Powder, by taking the Survival Shield X2, and the other InfoWarsLife.com products, to see if it accelerated it.
[00:40:11.681 --> 00:40:12.261]  And it did.
[00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:15.043]  This is what happened in just 45 days.
[00:40:15.083 --> 00:40:28.030]  We took this photo back there in the back office, and I'd already lost a lot of weight, but I lost another 6 pounds with the Oxy Powder and the other products at InfoWarsLife.com, and this photo was just taken a few days ago.
[00:40:29.246 --> 00:40:31.353]  And it wasn't just the acceleration of weight loss.
[00:40:31.653 --> 00:40:36.428]  My muscle mass increased along with my stamina and overall energy and libido.
[00:40:37.401 --> 00:40:42.025]  Take the Infowarslife.com challenge today and transform your body.
[00:40:42.426 --> 00:40:45.128]  I'm getting back to where I was 20 years ago.

[00:42:21.072 --> 00:42:25.476]  Okay, we're gonna play a little game of Is That Racist?
[00:42:29.759 --> 00:42:31.000]  So you might be a little biased.
[00:42:31.521 --> 00:42:39.387]  Alright, so we are playing a game today asking people out here to flip through these photos and say if it's racist or not.
[00:42:39.628 --> 00:42:39.928]  Okay.
[00:42:40.368 --> 00:42:43.411]  And you flip through the photos and just say yes or no it's racist.
[00:42:44.592 --> 00:42:45.412]  That's complicated.
[00:42:46.674 --> 00:42:46.874]  No.
[00:42:47.754 --> 00:42:47.895]  No.
[00:42:48.295 --> 00:42:49.316]  Is this racist to me?
[00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:50.791]  Let me know, racist or not?
[00:42:50.931 --> 00:42:51.471]  No ma'am!
[00:42:52.292 --> 00:42:54.434]  Of course, yes, the symbol is racist.
[00:42:54.894 --> 00:42:58.477]  So the General Lee from the Dukes of Hazzard, this car is racist?
[00:42:59.657 --> 00:43:00.398]  I would say yeah.
[00:43:00.898 --> 00:43:02.740]  So are Daisy Dukes racist?
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:03.460]  No.
[00:43:04.121 --> 00:43:04.721]  Those are great.
[00:43:07.703 --> 00:43:08.424]  Yes or no?
[00:43:08.444 --> 00:43:09.645]  Definitely racist.
[00:43:11.486 --> 00:43:13.808]  That's just kind of confusing, yeah.
[00:43:15.209 --> 00:43:17.211]  I like cats, but nah.
[00:43:18.371 --> 00:43:18.591]  No.
[00:43:18.671 --> 00:43:18.891]  No.
[00:43:19.211 --> 00:43:21.212]  Peanut butter and jelly is delicious.
[00:43:21.812 --> 00:43:22.892]  Now that is racist.
[00:43:22.932 --> 00:43:23.372]  No, just kidding.
[00:43:23.432 --> 00:43:23.492]  No.
[00:43:23.512 --> 00:43:23.552]  No.
[00:43:23.712 --> 00:43:24.412]  Interesting.
[00:43:26.332 --> 00:43:26.992]  Heck no.
[00:43:27.473 --> 00:43:28.053]  I don't know.
[00:43:28.333 --> 00:43:36.534]  The city of Portland has decided that using peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as an example is a racial microaggression.
[00:43:36.954 --> 00:43:40.315]  Some cultures did not grow up eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
[00:43:40.635 --> 00:43:41.655]  So that makes them racist?
[00:43:42.655 --> 00:43:44.475]  Racial, it's microaggressive.
[00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:45.796]  Microaggressive, okay.
[00:43:45.876 --> 00:43:47.216]  There's different levels to racism.
[00:43:48.288 --> 00:43:55.274]  That's ridiculous because, I mean, I really feel like people have redefined racism.
[00:43:55.834 --> 00:44:02.360]  You know, if I have control and power over you, that would be, because of the color of your skin, that would be racist.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.261]  But a sandwich?
[00:44:03.361 --> 00:44:05.983]  I mean, people don't even know what words mean anymore.
[00:44:06.203 --> 00:44:08.765]  And it's really irritating me, like hatred.
[00:44:09.226 --> 00:44:12.448]  Oh, you hate me because you don't agree, or you don't like the way I live.
[00:44:12.488 --> 00:44:13.629]  That's hatred, you know?
[00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:14.850]  So it's silly.
[00:44:16.597 --> 00:44:18.800]  I ain't gonna be no banker's slave.
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:22.745]  I ain't gonna be no banker's slave.
[00:44:23.266 --> 00:44:26.730]  Robbin' Peter to pay Paul from the cradle to the grave.
[00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:29.614]  I ain't gonna be no banker's slave.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.002]  I'm pretty sure a lot of people in that picture are racists.
[00:44:35.722 --> 00:44:38.244]  Kanye West is just a very confused man.
[00:44:38.564 --> 00:44:39.544]  He's a racist.
[00:44:39.584 --> 00:44:41.425]  He doesn't know what's up or down.
[00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:43.887]  That's Kid Rock.
[00:44:44.287 --> 00:44:45.948]  He's just, you know, a little white trash.
[00:44:46.008 --> 00:44:50.291]  Most of these people don't even know the meaning behind that Confederate flag.
[00:44:50.511 --> 00:44:53.052]  I mean, the flag represents, I agree, it represents slavery.
[00:44:53.112 --> 00:44:57.755]  I think it shouldn't really be a symbol in everyday life.
[00:44:58.925 --> 00:45:03.929]  I'm sorry, but the Stars and Bars was never flown as the national flag of the Confederacy.
[00:45:04.509 --> 00:45:07.352]  It was the flag of the Army of Northern Virginia.
[00:45:07.372 --> 00:45:12.155]  It was the battle flag, correct?
[00:45:12.756 --> 00:45:15.558]  It was the battle flag of the Confederate Army.
[00:45:16.119 --> 00:45:21.423]  Like I said before, most of the people who fought for that army never owned a slave.
[00:45:21.943 --> 00:45:25.446]  Granted, the aristocrats did, but like I said, it was on the way out.
[00:45:25.546 --> 00:45:27.447]  Slavery was an outdated institution.
[00:45:28.297 --> 00:45:28.577]  You know?
[00:45:28.597 --> 00:45:29.818]  You sound like a terrorist.
[00:45:30.299 --> 00:45:31.319]  I just might be.
[00:45:34.342 --> 00:45:37.764]  Obviously him, Lil Jon, has the same idea of this is the South.
[00:45:38.365 --> 00:45:39.386]  That's what they wore for it.
[00:45:39.646 --> 00:45:40.847]  I understood that when I saw it.
[00:45:41.968 --> 00:45:42.248]  So.
[00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:45.370]  A paper bag.
[00:45:45.931 --> 00:45:46.511]  Brown bag.
[00:45:47.552 --> 00:45:48.373]  Brown paper bag?
[00:45:49.093 --> 00:45:49.313]  No.
[00:45:50.034 --> 00:45:51.155]  How could this be racist?
[00:45:51.575 --> 00:45:55.238]  Well, it's a racial slur according to the city of Seattle.
[00:45:55.938 --> 00:45:56.319]  As in for?
[00:45:56.339 --> 00:45:57.860]  You're not allowed to brown bag your lunch.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.061]  Brown bag your lunch.
[00:45:59.983 --> 00:46:01.725]  That is not racist.
[00:46:01.906 --> 00:46:02.967]  Have you ever heard that term?
[00:46:03.288 --> 00:46:03.969]  I did.
[00:46:04.169 --> 00:46:04.590]  I have.
[00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:08.355]  If you're darker than the brown paper bag, then you're too dark.
[00:46:09.056 --> 00:46:10.719]  But white people didn't start that.
[00:46:10.739 --> 00:46:12.442]  That was something that black people did.
[00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:15.350]  So how could that be racist?
[00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:16.511]  You're educating me right now.
[00:46:16.731 --> 00:46:18.451]  Yes, I had nothing to do with white people.
[00:46:19.251 --> 00:46:25.613]  When we were kids, you know, black kids are taught that being dark is bad and that is, I've never heard that from a white person.
[00:46:25.793 --> 00:46:28.014]  I heard that from other black people.
[00:46:28.634 --> 00:46:36.776]  If I saw you walking down the street and you had it on, you're a Caucasian person, either you're saying, unless you approach me, hey, how you doing?
[00:46:37.395 --> 00:46:38.116]  I'll shake your hand.
[00:46:38.336 --> 00:46:39.017]  I can care less.
[00:46:39.799 --> 00:46:40.660]  It doesn't matter now.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:47.129]  If you're not trying to, you know, be around me or avoid me or you cross the street and you have this on, then I know to stand clear of you.
[00:46:47.209 --> 00:46:47.650]  I see you.
[00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:48.631]  That's what you're wearing.
[00:46:48.651 --> 00:46:49.472]  That's what you represent.
[00:46:49.873 --> 00:46:50.594]  I understand it now.
[00:46:51.564 --> 00:46:54.267]  Do you think this is more like a divide-and-conquer sort of diversion thing?
[00:46:54.287 --> 00:46:56.849]  Do you think there are more important things people should be worried about?
[00:46:56.869 --> 00:46:58.030]  There are way more important things.
[00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:08.280]  You announced, and my best friend is gay, you announced gay, like, it's legal everywhere on the same day that the guy was being buried, the preacher was being buried.
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.642]  So to me I just think it's a way, yeah, it's a diversion.
[00:47:11.323 --> 00:47:13.324]  This flag been up for years.
[00:47:14.244 --> 00:47:17.085]  Maybe just as long as the American flag has been waving or whatever.
[00:47:17.805 --> 00:47:19.626]  And nobody never brought this into context.
[00:47:19.846 --> 00:47:20.907]  KKK been around.
[00:47:21.607 --> 00:47:22.207]  Things like that.
[00:47:22.567 --> 00:47:29.029]  And now you bring it up when you have... The bigger issue is a young man, literally, a racial act happened.
[00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:30.310]  He said it happened.
[00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:33.071]  He went in there with intention on killing people.
[00:47:33.591 --> 00:47:35.992]  But now you bring this just to get everybody conversating.
[00:47:36.032 --> 00:47:36.632]  That's all it is.
[00:47:36.652 --> 00:47:37.592]  This is our version.
[00:47:37.712 --> 00:47:40.213]  Americans don't want to be informed, they want to be entertained.
[00:47:40.573 --> 00:47:41.513]  So this is entertainment.
[00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:45.094]  I'd rather live poor and be free.
[00:47:46.254 --> 00:47:49.055]  I'd rather live poor and be free.
[00:47:49.115 --> 00:47:52.635]  Than live in some cage in the lap of luxury.
[00:47:52.815 --> 00:47:55.416]  I'd rather live poor and be free.
[00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:14.115]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:14.555 --> 00:48:24.265]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:24.585 --> 00:48:28.348]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:28.909 --> 00:48:33.573]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:33.953 --> 00:48:40.198]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:40.498 --> 00:48:42.780]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:43.441 --> 00:48:45.883]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:48:46.283 --> 00:48:51.788]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:48:52.208 --> 00:48:58.871]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
[00:48:59.212 --> 00:49:04.134]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:49:04.194 --> 00:49:05.435]  DNA Force from InfoWarsLife.
[00:49:10.157 --> 00:49:11.398]  Another major health threat.
[00:49:11.418 --> 00:49:16.320]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.021]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:49:19.081 --> 00:49:25.843]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:49:26.104 --> 00:49:28.985]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:49:29.125 --> 00:49:32.046]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:49:32.126 --> 00:49:34.047]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:49:34.067 --> 00:49:36.868]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:49:36.988 --> 00:49:42.510]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:46.212]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:49:46.232 --> 00:49:49.233]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:49:49.253 --> 00:49:56.436]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:49:56.636 --> 00:49:59.497]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[00:49:59.858 --> 00:50:06.750]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today to purchase your Pro Pure Pro 1 G 2.0 water filtration system or call 1 8 8 2 5 3 3 1 3 9.
[00:50:15.711 --> 00:50:23.396]  A lot of people are really addicted to social media, but could there actually be a social network out there that is for the people?
[00:50:23.897 --> 00:50:28.620]  Well, my guest today, Bill Ottman, is the founder and CEO of Minds.com.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:45.312]  It's a new social network that's very similar to a lot of other platforms that you might be familiar with, but Minds.com sets themselves apart because they encrypt all of their messages, thereby keeping it safe from the prying eyes of advertisers and government agencies.
[00:50:46.391 --> 00:50:47.612]  So Bill, welcome to the show.
[00:50:47.752 --> 00:50:51.374]  Now, I'm very skeptical about any social network that's out there.
[00:50:51.495 --> 00:50:54.917]  So what is going to set Mines apart from the rest?
[00:50:56.058 --> 00:50:56.318]  Sure.
[00:50:56.918 --> 00:51:06.305]  So Mines is a free open source and encrypted social networking platform that actually rewards people with viral reach just for using the app.
[00:51:07.065 --> 00:51:12.329]  And it's democratically powered by the people through voting tools that we have on the site.
[00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:17.533]  You know, most status quo social networks, you really don't get anything out of them.
[00:51:17.573 --> 00:51:22.357]  In fact, they're exploiting you with corrupt algorithms and surveillance.
[00:51:22.457 --> 00:51:40.430]  So, between the fact that we're sharing our code, we don't have any access to user conversations, zero knowledge, we wanted to take ourselves out of that equation entirely, and the fact that just for using the app, you're increasing your reach so that more people can view your content.
[00:51:42.543 --> 00:52:01.032]  Right well because that was a big issue with the CIA funded Facebook was that they sort of got everyone hooked and really sucked in to this huge platform and then they just flipped with this new algorithm that really kind of suppressed the information and it was more of a pay-to-play type of a platform which
[00:52:01.952 --> 00:52:04.434]  Cause a lot of companies to tank actually.
[00:52:04.934 --> 00:52:09.937]  So now talking about your encryption, I mean, how do you, how do you know this isn't going to get hacked?
[00:52:10.417 --> 00:52:12.159]  How strong is this encryption?
[00:52:12.219 --> 00:52:14.000]  Like what would crypto experts say?
[00:52:15.313 --> 00:52:20.135]  Sure, so we already have people in the peer review community checking out our code.
[00:52:20.156 --> 00:52:28.280]  If you go to minds.org, actually, we just put it up, but it's sort of the skeleton of the governance and code model.
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:34.423]  So you can actually check out a bunch of the code there right now in terms of the encryption, and we're releasing all the code this year.
[00:52:35.458 --> 00:52:37.360]  Now, no encryption.
[00:52:37.701 --> 00:52:45.669]  To claim that it's perfect encryption, that would just be ridiculous to say, because encryption is an app.
[00:52:45.689 --> 00:52:52.156]  And actually allowing the community to inspect our code, it's the best that we can do.
[00:52:53.888 --> 00:52:55.470]  Compared to all other social networks.
[00:52:55.510 --> 00:53:07.385]  I mean, other networks will say that they're private and encrypted, but because their code is proprietary, they're not allowing the peer-reviewed community to inspect the code, so they're back doors into your system.
[00:53:08.976 --> 00:53:12.579]  So you're kind of in this beta testing stage right now.
[00:53:12.679 --> 00:53:18.705]  So you have people going in, experts looking at the code and saying, well, there's a vulnerability here.
[00:53:18.805 --> 00:53:21.007]  There's a flaw, a design flaw here.
[00:53:21.027 --> 00:53:27.273]  And are you sort of taking all that feedback and fixing it at that point, strengthening the encryption?
[00:53:28.149 --> 00:53:28.669]  Absolutely.
[00:53:28.709 --> 00:53:36.092]  We've already had a bunch of security researchers contact us privately about certain possible vulnerabilities.
[00:53:36.132 --> 00:53:40.673]  We've never been hacked to this point, so that sort of stands for itself.
[00:53:40.913 --> 00:53:43.594]  But we don't, we wouldn't claim to be hack-proof.
[00:53:43.674 --> 00:53:44.615]  Nobody is hack-proof.
[00:53:44.655 --> 00:53:52.857]  But we've had some great commentary on, there's a platform called Git, which allows programmers all over the world to collaborate on code.
[00:53:52.877 --> 00:53:57.439]  So we've already received some great suggestions there, and that's only going to keep amplifying.
[00:53:58.581 --> 00:54:02.963]  Right, because there was kind of a little bit of feedback with the online.
[00:54:02.983 --> 00:54:15.349]  I was seeing a lot of different anonymous groups out there sort of doing a little bit of infighting, saying, you know, anonymous, they're claiming that we all support this program, but, you know, obviously it's not an organization.
[00:54:15.409 --> 00:54:16.869]  It's more of an idea.
[00:54:17.269 --> 00:54:24.593]  So, you know, I've seen one of the bigger anonymous groups out there on Twitter saying, well, any social network is going to be CIA, especially if they say
[00:54:25.293 --> 00:54:25.853]  Trust us.
[00:54:26.394 --> 00:54:27.014]  Something like that.
[00:54:27.074 --> 00:54:33.718]  So what do you want to say to people out there that are kind of pushing you as the next Facebook?
[00:54:33.738 --> 00:54:39.361]  I mean, I guess you're saying right now you're not claiming to be totally hack-proof, but you're trying.
[00:54:39.904 --> 00:54:40.124]  Right.
[00:54:40.144 --> 00:54:42.565]  First of all, we're not saying trust us.
[00:54:42.785 --> 00:54:49.789]  I mean, we think that we're sort of doing everything we can by being transparent in this way.
[00:54:49.809 --> 00:54:58.232]  And, you know, the media sort of ran with the whole anonymous story because certain groups of anonymous do support what we're doing.
[00:54:58.252 --> 00:55:00.494]  And there's tons of anonymous accounts on the site.
[00:55:00.534 --> 00:55:01.934]  We allow anonymous accounts.
[00:55:02.454 --> 00:55:03.595]  You don't have to use your real name.
[00:55:03.615 --> 00:55:04.856]  You don't even have to use a real email.
[00:55:06.056 --> 00:55:11.122]  So definitely elements of anonymous do support us, but others are being skeptical and that's good.
[00:55:11.222 --> 00:55:16.388]  We think that, I mean, for everybody to just blindly say, oh yeah, go for it.
[00:55:17.049 --> 00:55:18.591]  You know, don't second guess everything.
[00:55:18.671 --> 00:55:23.076]  They should question what we're doing and we want that process to keep happening.
[00:55:23.792 --> 00:55:34.422]  Right, and that's why I think what you're doing is so important because allowing people to have access, you know, this open source platform, it's allowing people to be a part of the solution.
[00:55:34.842 --> 00:55:40.908]  So, describe to me, you know, why is it so important for people to understand the code that they're interacting with?
[00:55:41.909 --> 00:55:42.149]  Sure.
[00:55:43.499 --> 00:55:55.412]  Every time you turn on your computer, every time you open a browser, every time you log into an app, you're empowering a corporation with your energy and your activity on that network.
[00:55:56.525 --> 00:56:07.610]  When when people are using proprietary browsers like Chrome or Safari, or, you know, when this all of these, every time you log in, you're empowering them.
[00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:18.975]  So we're saying it's not just about using minds, it's about using all free and open source platforms, whether it's Firefox for your browser, or into for my browser for my operating system.
[00:56:20.111 --> 00:56:27.015]  This is these are empowering open companies, Wikipedia, they took out all the proprietary encyclopedias.
[00:56:27.415 --> 00:56:29.696]  And that has been a great thing for humanity in general.
[00:56:30.317 --> 00:56:34.779]  It's about having access to information about the products that we're consuming.
[00:56:35.459 --> 00:56:41.823]  So it's really if you're consuming an app or consuming an apple, it's kind of the same kind of situation.
[00:56:43.516 --> 00:56:51.388]  Right, and whether we like it or not, every single thing that we're going to be interacting with in the future is going to have some sort of a code.
[00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:54.333]  You know, they're talking about now swallowing
[00:56:55.532 --> 00:57:04.338]  Chips in order to have a biometric password or nanobots to be injected and help with health issues and things like that.
[00:57:04.598 --> 00:57:07.360]  All of these things are going to have code in them.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:19.548]  And so here, you know, if it's proprietary, you have no idea if that nanobot has some sort of a backdoor into an advertiser or some sort of corporation or, I mean, things we can't even comprehend.
[00:57:20.248 --> 00:57:21.709]  At this point right now.
[00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:24.371]  So, you know, what do you think about that?
[00:57:24.471 --> 00:57:38.362]  Facebook is actively talking about hooking everyone up to virtual reality, basically saying that at some point, you know, the things that you think your friends will immediately be able to experience it and things like that.
[00:57:38.402 --> 00:57:40.444]  I mean, what does that say for the future?
[00:57:40.464 --> 00:57:42.245]  What do you think people should be concerned with?
[00:57:43.767 --> 00:57:44.107]  Sure.
[00:57:44.287 --> 00:57:48.310]  Yeah, all of that stuff is really incredible and it's sort of inevitable.
[00:57:49.952 --> 00:57:57.477]  Double edged sword because it's solving health problems, but it also has these potential threats if the code is proprietary.
[00:57:58.037 --> 00:58:05.602]  So I guess you would call it transhumanist implants that you can get that are ethical and others that are proprietary.
[00:58:05.623 --> 00:58:11.927]  And so you actually don't know if they have backdoors into your biology, which is incredible to think about.
[00:58:12.807 --> 00:58:13.888]  But it's already happening now.
[00:58:13.988 --> 00:58:19.372]  People are already getting implants for vision and hearing, and it's doing incredible things.
[00:58:20.072 --> 00:58:20.812]  I think so.
[00:58:41.023 --> 00:58:53.655]  I'm sure there are going to be some ultimate ultra hackers out there that are going to be able to figure some stuff out, but I agree with you.
[00:58:53.695 --> 00:58:55.796]  It is kind of with the organic food movement.
[00:58:55.816 --> 00:59:02.482]  You've got to know what you're interacting with, what you're putting in your body, what you're using because you are empowering
[00:59:03.383 --> 00:59:07.384]  Whatever corporation or whatever entity that is that you're interacting with.
[00:59:07.744 --> 00:59:12.165]  So here, this is kind of a conscious social network, a conscious platform.
[00:59:12.625 --> 00:59:20.687]  So Bill, what else would you like to say about Minds.com and letting people know about how they can be part of this open source solution?
[00:59:21.627 --> 00:59:21.848]  Sure.
[00:59:22.568 --> 00:59:27.449]  So it's really about empowering free open source and encrypted networks.
[00:59:27.549 --> 00:59:28.809]  It's not just about Minds.
[00:59:28.849 --> 00:59:31.750]  We would love for people to help our movement, but
[00:59:33.038 --> 00:59:48.382]  What we think is that the ultimate top social network in the world should be free, open source, decentralized, and it's really a federation of all of the different free and open source projects happening in the world.
[00:59:48.742 --> 00:59:51.723]  All these platforms are going to come together to create this top network.
[00:59:53.464 --> 00:59:56.786]  So, yeah, I would just encourage people to use Firefox.
[00:59:58.086 --> 00:59:59.407]  Use Tor.
[00:59:59.887 --> 01:00:01.088]  Use Mines.
[01:00:01.268 --> 01:00:02.269]  Use Diaspora.
[01:00:02.529 --> 01:00:04.990]  Use all the other federated free and open source networks.
[01:00:06.371 --> 01:00:08.593]  Use GNU Linux for your operating system.
[01:00:08.633 --> 01:00:10.474]  I'm using Ubuntu right now.
[01:00:10.754 --> 01:00:19.299]  You don't think that it makes a difference, but, you know, if you're booting up into Apple and Microsoft products, you're empowering them, and it's just not enough.
[01:00:22.253 --> 01:00:22.513]  Right.
[01:00:22.613 --> 01:00:23.354]  And it's just as good.
[01:00:23.894 --> 01:00:24.675]  Yeah.
[01:00:24.935 --> 01:00:25.115]  Well.
[01:00:25.175 --> 01:00:29.338]  Oh, God.
[01:00:29.358 --> 01:00:30.379]  All right.
[01:00:33.161 --> 01:00:36.063]  So if you're plugging into Apple and Microsoft, they'll start there.
[01:00:37.714 --> 01:00:44.636]  Right, so if you're plugging into Apple and Microsoft when you boot up your computer, it's sort of this probably unconscious thing.
[01:00:44.656 --> 01:00:45.296]  People don't realize it.
[01:00:45.316 --> 01:00:46.657]  They think, oh, I have to use those.
[01:00:46.697 --> 01:00:47.737]  Those are the best out there.
[01:00:47.797 --> 01:00:53.499]  But really, you can use GNU Linux, which has tons of distributions for your operating system.
[01:00:53.599 --> 01:00:54.439]  I use Ubuntu.
[01:00:54.539 --> 01:00:56.059]  There's another one called Debian.
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:57.300]  There's Tails.
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.060]  They're just as easy to install.
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:03.942]  And every time you boot up your computer, you're supporting these conscious projects.
[01:01:04.702 --> 01:01:11.766]  Um, and so yeah, again, it's just about being conscious of what we're consuming and sort of voting with our dollars, voting with our energy.
[01:01:12.446 --> 01:01:12.987]  Absolutely.
[01:01:13.207 --> 01:01:18.109]  And we can see just how the organic food movement has taken off the same, the same thing.
[01:01:18.149 --> 01:01:27.814]  People voting with their dollars or people choosing to tune into alternative media rather than consuming, uh, lamestream dinosaur media for all of their news.
[01:01:27.854 --> 01:01:28.855]  That's what it's all about.
[01:01:29.095 --> 01:01:31.757]  There are power in numbers and it is all about
[01:01:32.717 --> 01:01:41.110]  Being conscious of what you're investing your energy into and absolutely fighting for the future because it doesn't belong to just those people who want to control it.
[01:01:41.571 --> 01:01:42.873]  Well, Bill, thank you so much.
[01:01:43.514 --> 01:01:44.776]  Founder of Minds.com.
[01:01:44.916 --> 01:01:46.538]  Thanks for having me.

[01:02:33.795 --> 01:02:37.142]  I want to talk about a perfect storm today.
[01:02:38.376 --> 01:02:42.738]  And the perfect storm I'm going to discuss is a really good perfect storm.
[01:02:43.478 --> 01:02:57.023]  I have prayed, literally, to be able to find a high quality gun sponsor that is affordable and that is extremely well made and effective that I can promote to my audience.
[01:02:57.563 --> 01:03:01.344]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.

[01:03:05.686 --> 01:03:11.807]  Super high quality, super lightweight, super accurate, and the experts salivate over it and love it.
[01:03:12.027 --> 01:03:23.969]  Their entire line of 556, 308, and their accessories are simply amazing, and it's designed by battle-hardened vets that know what they wish they would have had.

[01:03:40.891 --> 01:03:47.459]  Just a reminder to the Obama administration, there's plenty of room on the calendar for another holiday.
