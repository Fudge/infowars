[00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:21.626]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:26.269]  It is Thursday, December 31st, 2015, and I am Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.012]  Well, we have had quite an epic year here in 2015.
[00:00:31.413 --> 00:00:34.414]  We had an exclusive interview with Matt Drudge.
[00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:37.456]  He gave us a surprise drop-in visit here at the studio.
[00:00:37.897 --> 00:00:44.241]  And we also had a pretty epic interview with Donald Trump, but of course the establishment media was not happy about that.
[00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:49.865]  So we're going to go ahead and play some of the highlights of 2015 for you tonight.
[00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:56.690]  We've got an interview with Tucker Carlson, as well as with Mike Norris coming in to talk about his new movie.
[00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.312]  We're going to re-air some highlights from our interview with Donald Trump.
[00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:07.037]  But first, here is Alex Jones storming Google headquarters here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:07.398 --> 00:01:09.239]  Boy, the Texas tornado.
[00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:11.481]  He just loved to make his presence known.
[00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:13.042]  So let's go ahead and roll that clip.
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.202]  So I get wound up because it's fight and flight and there's nowhere to run.
[00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:21.724]  So I'm like a raccoon in the garage and somebody's about to kill me and I don't have a choice.
[00:01:21.744 --> 00:01:22.065]  I'm gonna fight.
[00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:22.405]  I'm gonna fight.
[00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:31.584]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:01:31.884 --> 00:01:33.166]  You can't survive without it.
[00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:34.268]  But where do you get it?
[00:01:34.568 --> 00:01:40.336]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:01:40.557 --> 00:01:46.285]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:01:46.465 --> 00:02:03.329]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.850]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.391]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:08.451]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:09.332]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:09.632 --> 00:02:11.453]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:02:24.198 --> 00:02:26.780]  Go to InfowarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:34.726]  The way some people see it, Big Brother is watching and his name is Google.
[00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:39.874]  Google's wearable computer is also facing stiff resistance, mostly over privacy concerns.
[00:02:40.074 --> 00:02:42.417]  Eric Schmidt is Google's CEO.
[00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:47.446]  If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.
[00:02:47.806 --> 00:02:52.171]  In the not-too-distant future, you'll likely see some of these cruising past you.
[00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:54.073]  There's what I call the creepy line.
[00:02:54.393 --> 00:02:58.538]  I would argue that implanting things in your brain is beyond the creepy line.
[00:02:58.618 --> 00:03:00.780]  Yes, yes.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.864]  At least for the moment, until the technology gets better.
[00:03:06.693 --> 00:03:10.997]  Now, a lot of times people ask me why I do confrontational things.
[00:03:11.037 --> 00:03:12.078]  I don't do as much as I used to.
[00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.581]  It's because the globalists are confronting us.
[00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:16.222]  They're getting in our face.
[00:03:16.242 --> 00:03:17.163]  They're doing things to us.
[00:03:18.604 --> 00:03:20.326]  And they're taking our data.
[00:03:20.947 --> 00:03:27.393]  And it's time we just give them a little bit of the aggressiveness they give us to illustrate how what they do is hidden hand.
[00:03:28.093 --> 00:03:29.174]  What they do is digital.
[00:03:30.014 --> 00:03:35.375]  The real power in this world is still, and will get even more powerful in the future, physical.
[00:03:36.075 --> 00:03:43.837]  As less people get physical, as less people deal in third dimension and use their mind for fourth and fifth dimension thinking, what we're doing right now is where it's all at.
[00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:44.237]  Let's go in.
[00:03:49.278 --> 00:03:50.538]  Hello ma'am, Alex Jones.
[00:03:50.558 --> 00:03:51.179]  How are you doing?
[00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:52.159]  I'm well sir, how are you?
[00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.699]  Good, good.
[00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.019]  This looks like an exciting event tonight.
[00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.399]  How are you doing?
[00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.959]  Alex Jones.
[00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:57.920]  InfoWars.com and here visiting our buddies at Google.
[00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:00.438]  What are you guys about to do here tonight?
[00:04:00.778 --> 00:04:02.799]  Actually, we don't allow recording in here.
[00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.140]  Well, but Google told me in an update that it uses the camera and microphone to listen to me in my house.
[00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.241]  Just one second.
[00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:14.063]  I mean, you don't allow recording in here, but you got our camera right there on the computer that Google says it uses to watch people.
[00:04:15.083 --> 00:04:16.203]  I'm a little confused by that.
[00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:20.805]  I mean, we got everybody getting roped in here, and then we're just here with a camera.
[00:04:20.825 --> 00:04:22.545]  I mean, Google's got its cameras on all our computers.
[00:04:22.585 --> 00:04:23.185]  We use Google.
[00:04:24.026 --> 00:04:24.546]  Watching us.
[00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:28.350]  I mean, just explain that to me.
[00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.834]  How can he say we shouldn't have a camera in here when Google is all about selling our data?
[00:04:33.835 --> 00:04:37.958]  You just listen to us inside our houses without asking and try to take our cars over?
[00:04:38.859 --> 00:04:39.299]  Is that all?
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.241]  You lobby government to take our cars away?
[00:04:42.262 --> 00:04:43.743]  Anyway, so we're just here with a camera.
[00:04:44.003 --> 00:04:47.987]  Google has phones, you know, dialing in, watching us, listening to us.
[00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:51.009]  I mean, I'm really trying to figure this out.
[00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:52.390]  Let's go look at some of the food over here.
[00:04:53.592 --> 00:04:53.872]  Here we go.
[00:04:56.033 --> 00:04:56.533]  Absolutely.
[00:04:56.613 --> 00:04:58.034]  Oh, we can't videotape in here?
[00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:00.676]  Don't worry, we're already streaming it live.
[00:05:00.696 --> 00:05:01.657]  You won't stop our transmission.
[00:05:02.257 --> 00:05:03.618]  Anyways, we're here inside Google.
[00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:05.299]  Invitation only.
[00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.442]  Google doesn't tell you it's invitation only when they hack into your house and watch and track everything you're doing.
[00:05:11.363 --> 00:05:13.644]  Look, we got lots of... This is a private event.
[00:05:13.684 --> 00:05:16.026]  Google does not... Oh, whoa, whoa, please don't touch our equipment.
[00:05:16.526 --> 00:05:19.248]  I'm not gonna touch your Google... Whoa, ma'am, don't touch me, please.
[00:05:19.428 --> 00:05:20.529]  This is a private event, sir.
[00:05:20.549 --> 00:05:22.930]  Ma'am, I don't wanna... Well, I need you to not touch me.
[00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.791]  Well, I need you to leave, sir.
[00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:25.370]  Okay, but is it a private event?
[00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.831]  Is Google watching and listening inside here?
[00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:28.272]  I do not work for Google.
[00:05:28.292 --> 00:05:29.032]  You shouldn't be touching me.
[00:05:29.072 --> 00:05:32.034]  That's assault.
[00:05:32.274 --> 00:05:34.856]  Well, I need a police officer to tell me that, so you need to go ahead and have them call.
[00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:36.737]  Oh, no problem.
[00:05:37.117 --> 00:05:37.577]  Yeah, do that.
[00:05:37.617 --> 00:05:37.918]  Go ahead.
[00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:41.940]  So again, Google trespasses on us, tracks and listens to everything we do.
[00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:45.102]  We come here, and what did I say the response would be?
[00:05:45.462 --> 00:05:45.983]  We're polite.
[00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:47.324]  We're nice.
[00:05:48.393 --> 00:05:56.116]  And this is how Google ropes in all the local community and gives them a little free cheese and stuff, like you do a mouse, before it gets in the trap and slams the door shut.
[00:05:56.996 --> 00:06:03.478]  But just like we've had all the NSA whistleblowers on, we're going to continue to expose the public front of the NSA.
[00:06:03.498 --> 00:06:04.579]  Come on, let's go back outside now.
[00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:12.761]  One of our latest additions to InfoWars, he's going to introduce himself now, just pointed out some key humet, or human intelligence, when he was inside.
[00:06:12.781 --> 00:06:14.242]  So we're going to go back in and show everybody.
[00:06:15.134 --> 00:06:23.780]  Michael Zimmerman, when we were inside just now, I noticed a sign on the window that says, when you're in this building, everything that goes on here is going to be recorded for this event.
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:30.284]  So you're on camera no matter where you are in the Google building, and they'll capture you on camera.
[00:06:30.564 --> 00:06:31.225]  But they're mad at us.
[00:06:31.245 --> 00:06:31.925]  Come show us the sign.
[00:06:31.965 --> 00:06:32.325]  Exactly.
[00:06:32.365 --> 00:06:33.026]  Come show us the sign.
[00:06:33.506 --> 00:06:34.227]  Here we go, round two.
[00:06:34.247 --> 00:06:35.267]  They're going to get really upset now.
[00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:40.371]  And just, Mr. Zimmerman, please point this out to us.
[00:06:41.584 --> 00:06:42.505]  Ma'am, we are back.
[00:06:42.605 --> 00:06:43.385]  We appreciate you.
[00:06:43.425 --> 00:06:46.267]  Real quick, I was here to see the sign.
[00:06:46.347 --> 00:06:51.370]  This says that everybody's being filmed in here by Google, just like they film you inside your house.
[00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.672]  So what would the issue be with us in here filming?
[00:06:54.692 --> 00:06:55.813]  Nothing against your event, ma'am.
[00:06:55.833 --> 00:06:57.594]  I'm sorry the Google spider has caught you.
[00:06:57.934 --> 00:06:58.895]  But notice to the public,
[00:07:00.811 --> 00:07:03.452]  Film and videotape is presently being shot in this location.
[00:07:03.552 --> 00:07:07.013]  All areas in this event are likely to be filmed for the least part of the administration.
[00:07:07.613 --> 00:07:09.514]  Now that's from Google, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:10.394 --> 00:07:11.354]  So that's what goes on.
[00:07:11.454 --> 00:07:12.455]  Thank you Google Fiber.
[00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:16.616]  See it on Infowars.com and on the Google platform YouTube.
[00:07:17.276 --> 00:07:19.297]  Because we use the enemy's platforms against them.
[00:07:19.817 --> 00:07:20.057]  Thank you.
[00:07:20.937 --> 00:07:26.262]  You know, Alex, we've come a long way with our understanding of Google, with our understanding of the tracking technology.
[00:07:26.282 --> 00:07:39.194]  I mean, years ago you talked to someone on the street, they had no idea they were being tracked in their Google searches to the extent they know now in their apps that they're accepting to give away all of their information to essentially the Borg system when they download iPhone apps or Android apps.
[00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:54.264]  I want to ask you where you see all this going with the future of AI cars, driverless cars, because I don't know about you, personally, I'm not against the advancements of technology, which absolutely we're not, and I'm not against the idea, even some day, of AI-based cars.
[00:07:54.824 --> 00:08:09.510]  My problem is the control system of the AI cars, the control system of forcing you into it, the control system of saying that you are a human slug without any ability to do anything for yourself, and these driverless AI systems and
[00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:10.530]  We're good to go.
[00:08:32.543 --> 00:08:35.245]  This stuff's been declassified over the last 50 years.
[00:08:35.285 --> 00:08:40.147]  This has been happening with DARPA and other agencies, and they decide the future.
[00:08:40.327 --> 00:08:53.815]  We've built this artificiality that has so many positive angles to it, but overall, the screen time, the television watching, lowering our IQ, causing brain damage, this is not
[00:08:54.878 --> 00:08:55.418]  Debatable.
[00:08:55.518 --> 00:09:08.862]  And so while they were building the Trojan horse, while they were putting their grid in place, which is now basically in place for this AI takeover, and that's in Google's own words, founded 16 years ago, they met and said, listen, we're not just building a search engine.
[00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.703]  We're not just working with DARPA and In-Q-Tel and the CIA.
[00:09:12.063 --> 00:09:13.324]  This is like in Wire Magazine now.
[00:09:14.384 --> 00:09:16.925]  And I was told this by NSA insiders like 14 years ago.
[00:09:17.005 --> 00:09:18.266]  Now it's in the news.
[00:09:18.886 --> 00:09:32.071]  Oh, we set out to build an artificially intelligent system that interfaces with billions of humans in lifetime and that basically humans are now nodes or eyeballs or robot droids or drones of Google.
[00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:35.735]  When Google is allowed to get past laws, other people can't.
[00:09:36.155 --> 00:09:43.103]  Google has this government relationship with NASA, you name it, nobody else has because it is really a governmental institution.
[00:09:43.423 --> 00:09:44.925]  And I don't want a single Google out.
[00:09:45.782 --> 00:09:53.684]  Google compared to like Apple, which is even bigger, and some of these other globalist corporations, is actually, are nice guys compared.
[00:09:54.185 --> 00:09:57.066]  And I don't just say that because, you know, I don't want to mess with Google.
[00:09:57.086 --> 00:09:58.086]  That's just the truth.
[00:09:58.646 --> 00:10:04.488]  That they understand, keep the web free, keep it somewhat open, while they grow to get their data.
[00:10:05.268 --> 00:10:08.050]  To be able to become a sentient AI system.
[00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:19.757]  And many scientists believe, and we'll put the articles up here on screen, that Google has already actually become sentient and has transcended IBM and its Deep Blue and its other systems.
[00:10:19.937 --> 00:10:24.520]  Take your destiny in your hands and don't let these people control your future and dominate who you are.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.423]  Discover what's really happening and realize that everything you do, the energy you expend,
[00:10:30.003 --> 00:10:37.430]  Is being sucked off by these people to build their their castle in the clouds to build their world and you're not supposed to have any part of that.
[00:10:38.131 --> 00:10:39.011]  That's a load of crap.
[00:10:39.652 --> 00:10:44.356]  We're going to expose what's happening and we're going to buy our actions change what these groups are doing.
[00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:47.299]  We're going to reach out to the executives of these companies.
[00:10:47.359 --> 00:10:50.061]  We're going to reach out to their children, their wives, their husbands.
[00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:55.285]  We're going to lay out an alternative to this program that's based on free will.
[00:10:55.565 --> 00:11:02.251]  And I assure you, if you take action and get involved in that discussion and creating that reality, these systems will fall.
[00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:03.672]  They're scared of you.
[00:11:03.972 --> 00:11:05.774]  And they know once humanity's unchained,
[00:11:06.454 --> 00:11:08.956]  They're not going to be able to have their control of the future and play God.
[00:11:09.236 --> 00:11:10.377]  And that's what they're scared of.
[00:11:10.857 --> 00:11:14.799]  But this fight's been played out in this universe many times, believe that.
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.622]  And 999 times out of a thousand, they failed.
[00:11:19.082 --> 00:11:20.423]  And that's why they're so scared.
[00:11:21.163 --> 00:11:23.785]  They've gotten better at what they do, but in the end, they will fall.
[00:11:24.145 --> 00:11:24.906]  Is the street okay?
[00:11:25.006 --> 00:11:25.646]  We're welcome inside?
[00:11:27.267 --> 00:11:27.688]  Well, thank you.
[00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:28.108]  You're sweet.
[00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:33.762]  I'm not sure everyone here would like to be on camera per se.
[00:11:33.802 --> 00:11:35.503]  It's a public event so you can come in.
[00:11:36.003 --> 00:11:36.843]  You work with Google, ma'am?
[00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:37.364]  They're very nice.
[00:11:37.464 --> 00:11:38.344]  I do, I do.
[00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:42.905]  When are they coming out with robots to replace you is what I want to know because you're too nice.
[00:11:42.925 --> 00:11:46.686]  So yeah, we happen to be hosting the city and the county here for an event.
[00:11:46.826 --> 00:11:48.327]  I'd actually appreciate not
[00:11:48.968 --> 00:11:49.668]  Alright, well you're being sweet.
[00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:58.170]  We just wanted to show that Google watches us and listens to us on the internet, and we just came and just figured people would freak out if we had a camera, which they kind of did.
[00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:02.931]  And there's a sign saying, though, that Google videotapes you inside, so we just... We're just all cameras.
[00:12:02.971 --> 00:12:04.131]  I mean, that's all we're showing.
[00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:06.392]  So I'd appreciate not being... Okay, well you're sweet.
[00:12:06.572 --> 00:12:07.792]  Hey, officers, be safe tonight.
[00:12:09.192 --> 00:12:10.093]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[00:12:10.133 --> 00:12:10.433]  Thank you.
[00:12:11.813 --> 00:12:12.733]  Well, thanks for putting up with me.
[00:12:13.313 --> 00:12:14.053]  Thank you, appreciate it.
[00:12:14.073 --> 00:12:15.174]  A couple listeners.
[00:12:15.794 --> 00:12:16.554]  Alright, anyways.
[00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.050]  Listen, we care about humans.
[00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.891]  We are the resistance.
[00:12:20.551 --> 00:12:23.452]  Just remember, when robots take all your family's jobs in a few years, we're here.
[00:12:23.492 --> 00:12:24.192]  We're here for the people.
[00:12:24.693 --> 00:12:25.413]  We're here for the humans.
[00:12:25.433 --> 00:12:26.833]  Alright, we're standing up as hard as we can.
[00:12:27.454 --> 00:12:28.434]  Later it's going to get bad.
[00:12:28.774 --> 00:12:29.614]  You'll break the conditioning then.
[00:12:29.654 --> 00:12:29.895]  Okay.
[00:12:30.235 --> 00:12:30.755]  Thank you very much.
[00:12:30.775 --> 00:12:31.235]  Appreciate it.
[00:12:32.676 --> 00:12:38.838]  And folks, if you want to stand up against the artificial intelligence that is Google, the NSA, and the corporate globalist,
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.161]  The now is the time.
[00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:52.054]  Their mothership, or their main takeover carcinogen metastasization system is at the corner of Colorado and 2nd Street in Austin, Texas.
[00:12:52.614 --> 00:12:54.497]  And again, nothing against those poor people inside.
[00:12:54.517 --> 00:12:56.038]  They have no idea what we're even talking about.
[00:12:56.919 --> 00:12:58.321]  We're not mad at them putting their hands on us.
[00:12:58.341 --> 00:13:00.463]  We're not mad at them trying to protect their
[00:13:01.064 --> 00:13:02.626]  Their cyborg takeover system.
[00:13:02.986 --> 00:13:04.107]  We understand they're dumbed down.
[00:13:04.167 --> 00:13:05.949]  That's who we're reaching out to.
[00:13:06.549 --> 00:13:08.811]  That's who we're trying to stand up for.
[00:13:09.151 --> 00:13:12.855]  But again, we're going to be showing during this report Google's admissions, Samsung's admissions.
[00:13:13.095 --> 00:13:15.337]  We're watching or listening in your house.
[00:13:16.158 --> 00:13:18.460]  And I'm going to do another stunt next week as I promised.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.441]  We're going to go to people's houses.
[00:13:19.981 --> 00:13:22.364]  Mainly Democrats and some of the folks we know that are
[00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:24.263]  It'll be very interesting.
[00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:44.362]  Because, because this is only the beginning.
[00:13:44.742 --> 00:13:47.323]  The general public thinks groveling to tyranny gets them ahead.
[00:13:47.343 --> 00:13:52.424]  We've had a lot of fans come by, we just had some guy walk by and go, hmm, thinking he's powerful.
[00:13:52.784 --> 00:13:56.926]  Because they're so cowardly, they just think grovel to the system, they're going to get ahead.
[00:13:57.806 --> 00:13:59.967]  Anthony Gucciardi, anything else you'd like to add?
[00:13:59.987 --> 00:14:03.088]  Well, it's just like when I went to the NSA, I guess it was about two years ago.
[00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:04.228]  We ought to show some clips of that.
[00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:05.148]  So, here, Josh.
[00:14:06.229 --> 00:14:06.829]  We've been here.
[00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.551]  Hey, we're just trying to find out.
[00:14:10.591 --> 00:14:13.212]  We just want to ask a few questions of your commanding officer.
[00:14:14.533 --> 00:14:17.035]  Alright, we're getting screamed at by the NSA agent.
[00:14:17.055 --> 00:14:20.097]  He's getting his car screaming at us, telling us to turn those cameras off right now.
[00:14:20.837 --> 00:14:22.018]  And he is very upset.
[00:14:22.378 --> 00:14:23.179]  He is very mad.
[00:14:23.259 --> 00:14:24.519]  Hey, we're saying we're on live feed.
[00:14:24.539 --> 00:14:25.200]  First Amendment.
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.641]  We're saying First Amendment.
[00:14:26.661 --> 00:14:27.861]  We just want to ask some questions.
[00:14:28.282 --> 00:14:29.302]  He's going up to Josh.
[00:14:29.322 --> 00:14:31.203]  He's about to take the camera from Josh.
[00:14:31.363 --> 00:14:32.684]  Oh, there's some more.
[00:14:32.884 --> 00:14:35.066]  Hey guys, we're just journalists here.
[00:14:36.027 --> 00:14:37.088]  We're just journalists.
[00:14:37.788 --> 00:14:39.089]  We're just trying.
[00:14:39.109 --> 00:14:41.210]  We're live streaming right now on Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.510]  Hey, excuse me, excuse me.
[00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.150]  Hey, hey.
[00:14:43.391 --> 00:14:44.811]  He cut the live feed.
[00:14:44.831 --> 00:14:47.773]  Alex, he just cut the live feed.
[00:14:48.553 --> 00:14:52.755]  We went up there, me and Josh, and we rolled up, and I asked them for their ID.
[00:14:53.115 --> 00:14:57.717]  And I guess the military police at the Utah NSA headquarters didn't like that too much.
[00:14:58.238 --> 00:15:01.499]  And I said, well, you get our information all the time.
[00:15:01.539 --> 00:15:02.300]  I want to see your ID.
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.422]  And of course they arrested us.
[00:15:04.982 --> 00:15:06.284]  Took all of our videos.
[00:15:06.784 --> 00:15:08.166]  But we're too dumb to actually erase them.
[00:15:08.186 --> 00:15:09.467]  Too dumb to actually erase them.
[00:15:09.848 --> 00:15:11.069]  Took everything we had.
[00:15:11.089 --> 00:15:11.970]  It was on live stream.
[00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.412]  I kept saying this is being live streamed.
[00:15:13.572 --> 00:15:14.293]  People already see this.
[00:15:14.573 --> 00:15:15.514]  This is being live streamed.
[00:15:15.614 --> 00:15:16.956]  This is on air to millions of people.
[00:15:17.556 --> 00:15:21.040]  And they told us if we came back we'd be put in a military detainment center.
[00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:24.063]  For me, going into a parking lot.
[00:15:24.083 --> 00:15:25.183]  I couldn't even get to their HQ.
[00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:26.264]  Went to their parking lot.
[00:15:26.284 --> 00:15:27.985]  But if you were ISIS, they would give you weapons.
[00:15:28.165 --> 00:15:31.948]  Yeah, if I was an undocumented migrant, I'd probably be let in immediately.
[00:15:32.288 --> 00:15:35.250]  But the whole point is... The point is these people are taking down America.
[00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:35.691]  Exactly.
[00:15:35.731 --> 00:15:38.693]  We do these stupid, silly things to make a point.
[00:15:38.733 --> 00:15:40.094]  We're an open, free society.
[00:15:40.234 --> 00:15:41.835]  They are just carving us up.
[00:15:42.395 --> 00:15:44.136]  And we're just here showing
[00:15:45.151 --> 00:15:46.372]  What a joke it is, exactly.
[00:15:46.412 --> 00:15:54.035]  We're just here desperately trying to get people to become aware of, are we land of the chumps, home of the schmucks, or are we land of the free, home of the brave?
[00:15:54.075 --> 00:15:54.335]  Anthony?
[00:15:54.675 --> 00:15:55.175]  Exactly.
[00:15:56.296 --> 00:16:02.318]  It's a stunt to show what they're doing in a more abrupt way, where this actually happens in a way that you can see it.
[00:16:03.099 --> 00:16:07.380]  We walk in, they get upset, but your information is being stolen and you're not upset about it, right?
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.621]  We go in there, they get upset.
[00:16:08.841 --> 00:16:11.202]  We go in there and they freak out that we're at Google.
[00:16:12.461 --> 00:16:17.828]  And that we dare even... We can record anything they do, but they can record everything we do and that's fine.
[00:16:18.209 --> 00:16:23.395]  Just like the NSA guys, I ask for their ID, they think I'm insane, but they have everything on me that I've ever done in my entire life.
[00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:24.317]  We have random folks walking by.
[00:16:24.357 --> 00:16:25.178]  Sir, do you have a comment?
[00:16:27.006 --> 00:16:27.587]  I don't have a comment.
[00:16:27.607 --> 00:16:27.987]  Not right now.
[00:16:28.047 --> 00:16:28.187]  I agree.
[00:16:28.207 --> 00:16:28.387]  I agree.
[00:16:28.407 --> 00:16:28.728]  I agree.
[00:16:28.768 --> 00:16:28.988]  I'm tired.
[00:16:29.028 --> 00:16:29.708]  It's been a long day.
[00:16:29.728 --> 00:16:30.569]  No, definitely not.
[00:16:52.475 --> 00:16:53.296]  I believe in progress.
[00:16:53.376 --> 00:16:54.156]  I think we're progressing.
[00:16:54.457 --> 00:16:59.601]  Well, the IQs are dropping, and the brainwaves are dropping, and the neural tissue is rotting.
[00:16:59.841 --> 00:17:02.503]  So we're not progressing according to... I think it's three steps forward and two steps back.
[00:17:03.845 --> 00:17:05.586]  But I think generally things are progressing.
[00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:07.408]  And the people running things, they love us?
[00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:09.349]  Uh, no.
[00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:11.671]  That's too abstract.
[00:17:11.691 --> 00:17:12.352]  That's too much abstract.
[00:17:12.372 --> 00:17:13.353]  Bernie Sanders loves us?
[00:17:14.525 --> 00:17:18.627]  Old Bernie said China has really great babies' rights, infant rights.
[00:17:19.207 --> 00:17:19.448]  Yeah?
[00:17:19.828 --> 00:17:20.128]  Okay.
[00:17:20.228 --> 00:17:20.948]  Do you agree with that?
[00:17:21.288 --> 00:17:23.530]  I've made my statement, and that is all I'm going to say.
[00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:25.871]  Bernie Sanders is great, but don't back up Bernie Sanders.
[00:17:26.731 --> 00:17:29.973]  What about China killing 50 million girls, including after they're born?
[00:17:30.353 --> 00:17:32.334]  You don't even know about that?
[00:17:32.354 --> 00:17:32.934]  She doesn't know.
[00:17:32.994 --> 00:17:34.055]  That's a shield against that.
[00:17:34.375 --> 00:17:37.177]  And so Bernie Sanders is great, and China has the model.
[00:17:39.161 --> 00:17:39.601]  Time to go.
[00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:39.701]  Bye.
[00:17:41.643 --> 00:17:42.303]  Take care, man.
[00:17:42.703 --> 00:17:43.043]  Be safe.
[00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:43.824]  See, it's all funny.
[00:17:44.244 --> 00:17:47.706]  Bernie Sanders is going to save us, but China has got great stuff for babies.
[00:17:48.627 --> 00:17:50.608]  And then, like, kind of videotape.
[00:17:50.648 --> 00:17:51.969]  Like, you videotape us, we videotape you.
[00:17:52.009 --> 00:17:52.909]  Like, we're intimidated by that.
[00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.470]  We go up against the New World Order.
[00:17:55.351 --> 00:17:59.213]  But see how they've instilled a love of destruction, a love of enslavement in these people?
[00:18:01.154 --> 00:18:02.215]  Well, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:02.275 --> 00:18:03.456]  Alex Jones inside Google.
[00:18:04.269 --> 00:18:06.611]  Simply saying, hey, you watch us, we watch you.
[00:18:06.971 --> 00:18:13.997]  And we're going to recommend InfoWarriors in the next few weeks come down here by the thousands and come in with your phones and do live reports surveilling them.
[00:18:14.217 --> 00:18:15.378]  They won't be able to stop the signal.
[00:18:16.319 --> 00:18:21.243]  Shane Steiner's involvement with InfoWarsLife.com truly happened in an organic way.
[00:18:21.383 --> 00:18:21.443]  I'm
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.400]  Sure, take some home, try it.
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:44.042]  Well, a few weeks later, he came in, blown away, and said, I want to buy three boxes of this stuff to give my friends and family.
[00:18:44.462 --> 00:18:45.962]  It's simply amazing.
[00:18:46.003 --> 00:18:47.283]  He said, why does it work so well?
[00:18:47.323 --> 00:18:51.844]  And I said, listen, go to Infowarslife.com, watch the informational videos with Dr. Group and others.
[00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:53.584]  They understand how it all works.
[00:18:53.865 --> 00:18:55.425]  I know that it works for me.
[00:18:55.545 --> 00:18:56.685]  That's all I understand.
[00:18:56.945 --> 00:19:01.987]  The science, the facts, the research, people's testimonials, they're all on Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:02.027 --> 00:19:02.987]  You can check it out for yourself.
[00:19:03.587 --> 00:19:04.689]  I wanted to go to the gym.
[00:19:04.949 --> 00:19:14.802]  I wanted to push myself and work out harder, and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that, which I would have never done.
[00:19:14.822 --> 00:19:17.345]  I never would have done that two years ago.
[00:19:17.946 --> 00:19:21.570]  Shane has said over and over again, more than just libido and energy,
[00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:23.873]  It made him want to get into the gym more.
[00:19:24.214 --> 00:19:25.675]  It made him want to get in better shape.
[00:19:25.715 --> 00:19:28.338]  And believe me, the Steiners have amazing genetics.
[00:19:28.899 --> 00:19:31.322]  His brother is a world champion steer wrestler.
[00:19:31.662 --> 00:19:35.647]  His dad, Bobby Steiner, is a famous world champion bull rider.
[00:19:35.847 --> 00:19:37.509]  They've got natural genetics.
[00:19:37.949 --> 00:19:42.675]  But when you added this to the mix, in Shane's own words, it took him to the next level.
[00:19:54.972 --> 00:19:56.693]  Shane noticed the mental clarity.
[00:19:57.133 --> 00:20:00.615]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass.
[00:20:00.735 --> 00:20:02.036]  He's already completely shredded.
[00:20:02.236 --> 00:20:04.898]  I gotta admit, for me, the biggest effect has been libido.
[00:20:05.258 --> 00:20:11.302]  Now, I've never claimed to have a body like some beach model, but back when I was 20, 22 years old and worked out every day, I looked great.
[00:20:11.342 --> 00:20:17.365]  But over the years, being married, having three kids, working 18 hours a day, I gained basically 100 pounds.
[00:20:17.505 --> 00:20:20.647]  And it's been a long process of losing that weight in the last four years.
[00:20:20.807 --> 00:20:23.389]  But if you look at the photos and the videos,
[00:20:23.649 --> 00:20:23.909]  Of course!
[00:20:42.834 --> 00:20:52.898]  This has actually made me feel so good that here lately, about a year ago, I started training jiu-jitsu and that kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing.
[00:20:52.918 --> 00:21:05.404]  I mean, it's amazing that two years ago I was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now I'm training with MMA fighters and just doing stuff that I never thought that I would be doing ever again.
[00:21:05.684 --> 00:21:07.525]  So, Supermail Vitality has
[00:21:08.405 --> 00:21:08.926]  I don't know.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.140]  You'll love it.
[00:22:03.065 --> 00:22:12.429]  Bottom line folks, you want to discover the power of super male vitality and super female vitality for yourself by visiting InfoWarsLife.com today or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:21.328 --> 00:22:24.392]  Well, we had Matt Drudge about a month ago in studio.
[00:22:24.492 --> 00:22:26.114]  Only does an interview every three, four years.
[00:22:26.494 --> 00:22:27.796]  And I thought that got me excited.
[00:22:28.457 --> 00:22:33.583]  But I'm telling you, Donald Trump is our guest, ladies and gentlemen, for the next 30 minutes or so.
[00:22:34.243 --> 00:22:36.847]  And obviously, he is a maverick.
[00:22:37.327 --> 00:22:38.087]  He's an original.
[00:22:38.147 --> 00:22:39.148]  He tells it like it is.
[00:22:39.588 --> 00:22:40.608]  Doesn't read off a teleprompter.
[00:22:40.708 --> 00:22:42.169]  Neither do I. He's self-made.
[00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:47.051]  This whole media operation that reaches 20 million people a week worldwide, conservatively, self-made.
[00:22:47.311 --> 00:22:48.451]  That's why I'm so excited.
[00:22:48.771 --> 00:22:52.753]  And he joins us from Trump Tower in New York City.
[00:22:52.773 --> 00:22:55.754]  He is the leading 2016 Republican presidential contender.
[00:22:56.074 --> 00:22:58.415]  Donald Trump, again, joins us.
[00:22:58.795 --> 00:23:00.236]  And I've got so many questions.
[00:23:00.296 --> 00:23:02.857]  But first off, Donald, thank you for joining us.
[00:23:03.357 --> 00:23:04.117]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:23:04.437 --> 00:23:04.677]  Great.
[00:23:04.918 --> 00:23:05.638]  Great to be with you.
[00:23:06.815 --> 00:23:07.035]  I've got
[00:23:25.748 --> 00:23:27.009]  I mean, what's going on here?
[00:23:45.385 --> 00:23:46.886]  Mr. Trump, I saw it myself.
[00:23:47.006 --> 00:23:47.546]  I was there.
[00:23:47.586 --> 00:23:50.868]  They talked about Patterson, but they said, I saw it myself, Mr. Trump.
[00:23:50.928 --> 00:23:51.488]  I was there.
[00:23:52.048 --> 00:23:56.610]  So many people have called in and on Twitter, at real Donald Trump, they're all tweeting.
[00:23:57.311 --> 00:24:02.953]  So I knew it happened and I held my line and people wanted me to apologize and we can't do that.
[00:24:02.993 --> 00:24:04.794]  People like you and I can't do that so easily.
[00:24:05.054 --> 00:24:06.975]  Now, we can do it if we're wrong, Alex.
[00:24:06.995 --> 00:24:07.736]  You apologize.
[00:24:07.796 --> 00:24:13.398]  I'd apologize if I was wrong, but they were celebrating and they were celebrating the fall of the World Trade Center.
[00:24:13.438 --> 00:24:14.599]  I think that's disgraceful.
[00:24:15.538 --> 00:24:15.899]  It is.
[00:24:15.999 --> 00:24:30.298]  And that same week you were reporting on that fact, we had two different international football games, soccer games, with the Turkish fans and others during the moment of silence for the dead people in Paris chanting Allah Akbar and booing.
[00:24:30.618 --> 00:24:32.060]  So did that not happen too?
[00:24:33.001 --> 00:24:34.623]  Well, that happened and everybody saw it.
[00:24:34.663 --> 00:24:37.985]  That was a week ago and the players were out on the field and they couldn't believe it.
[00:24:38.025 --> 00:24:38.686]  They were embarrassed.
[00:24:38.706 --> 00:24:39.547]  They didn't know what to do.
[00:24:39.607 --> 00:24:42.489]  The coach and the managers, they all apologized, but it happened.
[00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:44.351]  Look, we have to deal with reality.
[00:24:44.951 --> 00:24:47.934]  And you know, it all started because they said, we need surveillance.
[00:24:47.994 --> 00:24:49.295]  We need proper surveillance.
[00:24:49.375 --> 00:24:51.317]  We have people that truly are evil.
[00:24:51.977 --> 00:24:56.599]  And they're coming from someplace and you know sort of where they're coming from, at least the vicinity.
[00:24:57.159 --> 00:25:00.961]  And I said, we need proper surveillance, whether it's a mosque or any place else.
[00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:07.184]  We have to be surveilled and we have to see what's coming at us because we're not going to have a country anymore between the week.
[00:25:07.364 --> 00:25:07.784]  I don't know.
[00:25:25.814 --> 00:25:35.298]  But you look at what's happening where we have a president that's over there celebrating global warming and trying to get everybody excited about global warming, like that's our number one problem.
[00:25:35.338 --> 00:25:37.418]  He considers that to be our number one problem.
[00:25:38.019 --> 00:25:42.620]  And our number one problem is what's going on where they want to blow up our cities and they want to blow up our country.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.941]  That's our number one problem.
[00:25:44.281 --> 00:25:58.072]  It's now in mainstream news, Associated Press and others are reporting that it's a secret deal with Turkey, with the Germans, with Merkel, the admitted socialist, to bring in millions of radical Islamists.
[00:25:58.112 --> 00:26:01.875]  They admit almost all of them are Sunni, that basically invaded Syria.
[00:26:02.215 --> 00:26:06.779]  They're getting their butt kicked by the Russians, so now they want to flee up to the north into Turkey.
[00:26:07.279 --> 00:26:13.224]  You said months ago, bomb the oil of ISIS, and the mainstream media laughed because you said the sky was blue again.
[00:26:13.664 --> 00:26:23.871]  Now the Pentagon says that's the right thing to do, and now you've come out saying, quote, it looks like that Turkey's on the side of ISIS, close quote.
[00:26:24.111 --> 00:26:39.422]  Well, the next day the Russians released satellite photos documenting that there are literally thousands of trucks coming up to the border at these huge terminals connected to Irgun, the president's son, making billions of dollars total off of this.
[00:26:39.802 --> 00:26:41.924]  Again, you're in trouble for saying the sky is blue.
[00:26:43.356 --> 00:26:44.557]  Well, I was right about that.
[00:26:44.617 --> 00:26:57.465]  I was right in saying in a book that I wrote, you covered it really nicely, I appreciate it, but I wrote a very political book years ago in the year 2000, The America We Deserve, and I said in that book that we better be careful with this guy named Osama Bin Laden.
[00:26:57.505 --> 00:27:06.210]  I mean, I really study this stuff, I really find it very interesting, and even though I'm a businessman, I find it, I've always found, I've always been involved in politics.
[00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:08.772]  I said, we better be careful with Osama Bin Laden.
[00:27:08.792 --> 00:27:11.634]  There's a guy named Osama Bin Laden, nobody really knew who he was, but
[00:27:12.054 --> 00:27:12.814]  He was nasty.
[00:27:12.854 --> 00:27:16.716]  He was saying really nasty things about our country and what he wants to do to it.
[00:27:17.296 --> 00:27:21.878]  And I wrote in a book, 2000, two years before the World Trade Center came down, I talked about Osama bin Laden.
[00:27:21.898 --> 00:27:22.779]  You better take him out.
[00:27:22.819 --> 00:27:24.319]  I said, he's going to crawl under a rock.
[00:27:24.659 --> 00:27:25.620]  You better take him out.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:31.562]  And now people are seeing that, they're saying, you know, Trump predicted Osama bin Laden, which actually is true.
[00:27:31.983 --> 00:27:34.984]  And then two years later, a year and a half later, he knocked down the World Trade Center.
[00:27:35.504 --> 00:27:39.166]  And I talked about terrorism and that was before terrorism as we know it today.
[00:27:39.226 --> 00:27:40.887]  I said, we better be careful.
[00:27:40.927 --> 00:27:41.587]  That's going to happen.
[00:27:41.607 --> 00:27:42.447]  It's going to be a big thing.
[00:27:42.487 --> 00:27:43.688]  And it certainly is a big thing.
[00:27:43.728 --> 00:27:51.932]  So with the oil, and I'm glad you brought it up, but as you know, for three years, I've been saying you better take out the oil because if you don't take the oil, it's going to be a problem.
[00:27:52.292 --> 00:27:53.473]  So we shouldn't have been in Iraq.
[00:27:53.853 --> 00:27:58.555]  But once we got there, the way we came out was horrible.
[00:27:58.915 --> 00:27:59.916]  And I said, take the oil.
[00:28:00.456 --> 00:28:06.363]  Then we didn't take the oil, so ISIS got the oil, and as you know, Iran is getting the oil, because Iran is going to take over all of Iraq.
[00:28:07.104 --> 00:28:15.734]  You know, we made one of the worst deals in the history of our world when we gave them $150 billion, and virtually we gave them keys to nuclear weapons.
[00:28:16.055 --> 00:28:18.758]  The more I research what you've actually said and done, it's amazing.
[00:28:19.018 --> 00:28:19.839]  You were the only...
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:25.044]  leading American figure who openly said do not go to war in Iraq.
[00:28:25.344 --> 00:28:29.047]  They had almost, what, 90% votes in Congress for it, bipartisan.
[00:28:29.408 --> 00:28:31.670]  You said don't do it, Iran will take over.
[00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:42.659]  I mean, look, you can say that today and everybody can say that, but you said that in 2001, 2002, 2003 when it was very unpopular because you've done your research and had good advisors.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.442]  How did you know that when almost no one else did?
[00:28:46.397 --> 00:28:49.159]  Well, first of all, I'm the most militaristic person there is.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.040]  I'm going to build the military.
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:54.264]  If I win, I'm going to make our military so strong, so powerful that nobody's going to mess with us.
[00:28:54.284 --> 00:28:56.486]  We're going to take care of our vets and all of that.
[00:28:57.027 --> 00:29:01.330]  But I have to tell you, you have to know if you're going to go to war, you have to do it properly and you have to know what to do.
[00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:02.331]  I viewed it as this.
[00:29:02.792 --> 00:29:07.616]  Iran and Iraq were the same in terms of strength, and they'd have been constantly fighting.
[00:29:07.656 --> 00:29:08.677]  That's all they do is they fight.
[00:29:09.057 --> 00:29:16.258]  They go to war all the time, and they'd move 10 feet left, 10 feet right, 10 feet left, then they'd rest, and then they'd start it again four years later.
[00:29:16.278 --> 00:29:19.339]  This has been going on for... Forever.
[00:29:19.699 --> 00:29:20.479]  And this is the way it is.
[00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:26.360]  I said, if you take out Iran, or if you take out Iraq, either one, you're going to destabilize the Middle East.
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:27.400]  Well, we took out Iraq.
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:32.341]  And by the way, Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world.
[00:29:32.441 --> 00:29:33.421]  People don't even know that.
[00:29:33.481 --> 00:29:35.182]  So we gave, like, incredible.
[00:29:35.502 --> 00:29:36.182]  We took out Iraq.
[00:29:36.202 --> 00:29:37.142]  I said, you're going to destabilize.
[00:29:37.802 --> 00:29:46.390]  And I said, and you'll know this, and you know this, and I appreciate what you just said, then Iran is going to come in and Iran is going to take over Iraq.
[00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:48.612]  And they're just taking it over right now.
[00:29:48.672 --> 00:29:49.893]  As we speak, they're taking it over.
[00:29:50.153 --> 00:29:57.800]  Iran is running Iraq and very soon will be virtually, going to be totally running Iraq, especially after all of the, you know, the deal we just made, which is the worst.
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.842]  So I said, keep the oil.
[00:30:00.779 --> 00:30:00.939]  I don't
[00:30:20.922 --> 00:30:24.584]  We have wounded warriors who I love all over the place, and what do we get out of it Alex?
[00:30:24.644 --> 00:30:25.404]  We get nothing!
[00:30:25.464 --> 00:30:26.164]  We have nothing.
[00:30:26.244 --> 00:30:29.325]  No, the French and the Germans are getting the oil and the Iranians are getting the oil.
[00:30:29.746 --> 00:30:31.746]  And you know who the number one customer for the oil is?
[00:30:32.006 --> 00:30:32.467]  Guess what?
[00:30:32.607 --> 00:30:32.987]  China.
[00:30:33.367 --> 00:30:33.667]  That's right.
[00:30:33.847 --> 00:30:34.968]  How smart is China?
[00:30:35.248 --> 00:30:43.851]  They outsmart us on every level, militarily, they outsmart us on trade, like we're losing, we have a 450 billion dollar trade deficit with China.
[00:30:43.871 --> 00:30:45.832]  Let me ask you this, you're a top business guy, you know,
[00:30:46.152 --> 00:30:47.413]  On your own, from nothing.
[00:30:47.934 --> 00:30:53.179]  How did China get 97% of rare earth minerals in the world?
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.383]  How is the United States or nobody else even trying to get rare earth minerals?
[00:30:56.603 --> 00:30:59.045]  How did we just give them the global market in that?
[00:30:59.065 --> 00:30:59.686]  That's crazy.
[00:31:00.327 --> 00:31:02.409]  Well, what a lot of people don't know, Afghanistan.
[00:31:02.449 --> 00:31:07.834]  Now, Afghanistan is a place we can go in because, you know, you have Pakistan and you have nuclear weapons and a lot of things going on there.
[00:31:09.015 --> 00:31:13.260]  We go into Afghanistan, we're fighting, you know, tremendous mountains and ridges.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:17.785]  We're fighting on one side, and you know who's got their excavators on the other side?
[00:31:17.805 --> 00:31:17.985]  China.
[00:31:18.005 --> 00:31:19.086]  China, taking out all the minerals.
[00:31:19.386 --> 00:31:23.370]  You know, Afghanistan, nobody knew this, Afghanistan is rich with minerals.
[00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:24.492]  Not oil, but minerals.
[00:31:24.652 --> 00:31:25.412]  Lithium, everything.
[00:31:26.033 --> 00:31:27.753]  And China's taken out all the minerals.
[00:31:28.113 --> 00:31:29.014]  And here we are fighting.
[00:31:29.054 --> 00:31:29.814]  We have trillions.
[00:31:29.874 --> 00:31:32.054]  We have like a trillion dollars in Afghanistan.
[00:31:32.574 --> 00:31:33.674]  And we get nothing out of it.
[00:31:33.714 --> 00:31:37.555]  And we're going to end up leaving and keeping a couple of thousand soldiers there and this and that.
[00:31:37.855 --> 00:31:38.455]  We get nothing.
[00:31:38.735 --> 00:31:40.576]  China has taken out the minerals.
[00:31:40.896 --> 00:31:48.657]  They're the buyers, the big buyers at very, very low prices of, as you know, of the oil in Iraq and probably in Syria.
[00:31:48.677 --> 00:31:50.257]  But China is a big buyer of the oil.
[00:31:50.637 --> 00:31:53.018]  But one thing with the oil, because you've covered it,
[00:31:53.618 --> 00:31:56.879]  For three years I've been saying, hit the oil, because ISIS is getting stronger.
[00:31:56.919 --> 00:32:00.640]  They're no JV, as the President said, and they're certainly not contained.
[00:32:01.161 --> 00:32:03.401]  But I said, hit the oil, and hit them hard.
[00:32:04.182 --> 00:32:04.962]  And they laughed at me.
[00:32:05.202 --> 00:32:08.923]  And they would put generals on television saying, no, that strategy wouldn't work.
[00:32:08.943 --> 00:32:10.904]  Well, after Paris, they started hitting the oil.
[00:32:11.364 --> 00:32:12.004]  And it does work.
[00:32:12.024 --> 00:32:14.665]  The problem is, we've given them a two-year edge.
[00:32:14.705 --> 00:32:15.846]  They have billions of dollars.
[00:32:15.866 --> 00:32:19.487]  The Russians started hitting the oil for one month, and ISIS is already rolling over.
[00:32:19.787 --> 00:32:21.768]  So Putin is following your strategy.
[00:32:27.142 --> 00:32:36.428]  You guys have the exclusive for which is a product called Deep Cleanse and why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula almost like the iodine crystals.
[00:32:36.508 --> 00:32:40.270]  We have two unique products that nobody in the world has.
[00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:52.437]  One of the most amazing ingredients in the world and it's called Shilajit and it's actually known as blood of the mountain or rock sweat because thousands of years ago, as a matter of fact, this ingredient
[00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:59.040]  Was only given to the elite of the elite thousands of years ago up in the Himalayan mountains and in Tibet.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.902]  And we wanted to put this in stuff for a couple years, but we couldn't get an organic form.
[00:33:03.082 --> 00:33:03.302]  Right.
[00:33:03.382 --> 00:33:04.422]  I mean, let's explain.
[00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:07.624]  I mean, this stuff's so good, we couldn't put it out for years.
[00:33:07.904 --> 00:33:16.353]  Right, so I had to actually, it's kind of like the iodine crystals, finding a source deep in the earth that we could get the cleanest source available.
[00:33:16.793 --> 00:33:26.343]  But in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan mountains, thousands of years ago they found, they watched these monkeys and during the summer months the monkeys would go up into the mountains.
[00:33:26.363 --> 00:33:27.625]  Now you're being racist against monkeys.
[00:33:27.665 --> 00:33:28.306]  And they would pick
[00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:31.207]  This black substance from the mountains.
[00:33:31.668 --> 00:33:38.171]  And so in Russia, they actually, it grows in Russia and the mountains and in the Himalayas and only in the summer.
[00:33:38.272 --> 00:33:46.476]  And shilajit is actually the decomposition of up to 7,000 different medicinal herbs.
[00:33:46.536 --> 00:33:53.200]  So it decomposes, all these different herbs decompose in the Himalayan mountains and the volcanic soil up there.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.483]  And what happens in the summertime... So it's almost like an oil from
[00:33:58.343 --> 00:34:01.126]  Yes, it's high in fulvic acid, it's high in humic acid.
[00:34:01.167 --> 00:34:05.411]  They're always claiming oil is really from decomposed animals and plants.
[00:34:05.972 --> 00:34:10.417]  There is some oil that is based from fossils, but most of it's really abiotic.
[00:34:10.818 --> 00:34:14.802]  So this is a true fossil source?
[00:34:14.823 --> 00:34:15.583]  I mean, explain it to me.
[00:34:16.284 --> 00:34:16.624]  It is.
[00:34:17.024 --> 00:34:22.345]  It's really the decomposition, like I said, of over 7,000 different medicinal herbs and plants.
[00:34:22.505 --> 00:34:26.306]  And with the rocks and the pressure deep in the mountains, it freezes.
[00:34:26.366 --> 00:34:31.327]  And during the summertime and the pressures build it up, it oozes out.
[00:34:31.427 --> 00:34:33.007]  So it literally oozes out of the mountain.
[00:34:33.027 --> 00:34:33.827]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:34.187 --> 00:34:35.188]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:35.228 --> 00:34:38.348]  It's black and it's highly nutritious.
[00:34:39.188 --> 00:34:41.809]  Even in the 1980s, when the Olympic
[00:34:42.529 --> 00:34:44.850]  Athletes in Russia were accused of being on steroids.
[00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:52.231]  They found out that they were actually been given Shilajit because it works as an anabolic as well and it builds muscles.
[00:34:52.431 --> 00:34:53.491]  It's a big dose in there.
[00:34:53.511 --> 00:35:03.234]  The second big main ingredient in there is a volcanic zeolite concentrate and what this formula is designed to do, the Shilajit and the zeolites have a real strong negative charge.
[00:35:03.694 --> 00:35:08.615]  All the metals and chemicals and PCBs and VOCs have positive charges.
[00:35:09.415 --> 00:35:17.525]  So these go in, they grab it, and then they safely eliminate it through the body so you can become healthy.
[00:35:17.565 --> 00:35:21.509]  I mean, this is an amazing formula.
[00:35:21.649 --> 00:35:27.516]  I wish I actually had it, but because this was an exclusive InfoWars Life product, you're the only one in the world that has.
[00:35:28.137 --> 00:35:36.043]  This formula now, and you know, there is going to be a limited supply available when you sell out because you can only harvest this once a year.
[00:35:36.183 --> 00:35:37.243]  How do people take it?
[00:35:37.303 --> 00:35:39.625]  How is it recommended that this be done?
[00:35:39.725 --> 00:35:41.426]  Just a daily dose?
[00:35:41.707 --> 00:35:43.428]  Yeah, daily dose.
[00:35:43.528 --> 00:35:44.889]  The instructions are on the label.
[00:35:44.929 --> 00:35:48.331]  You know, of course, I kind of modify it for each individual.
[00:35:48.351 --> 00:35:49.912]  It depends on what your lifestyle is.
[00:35:49.952 --> 00:35:55.076]  I mean, honestly, the best thing to do is for you to avoid all these chemicals and toxins in your environment.
[00:35:55.416 --> 00:35:55.816]  I don't know.
[00:36:16.963 --> 00:36:18.383]  Because these aren't just great products.
[00:36:18.403 --> 00:36:20.204]  This is how we fund this independent operation.
[00:36:20.224 --> 00:36:25.424]  We're not taxpayer-funded like MSNBC or NPR, and neither is your local station, so support them, folks.
[00:36:25.605 --> 00:36:26.325]  This is a war.
[00:36:32.306 --> 00:36:33.506]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:36:33.526 --> 00:36:34.426]  to 3 p.m.
[00:36:34.466 --> 00:36:36.146]  Central, we're here live.
[00:36:37.026 --> 00:36:39.667]  Mike Norris, accomplished filmmaker.
[00:36:40.467 --> 00:36:40.787]  Here it is.
[00:36:40.807 --> 00:36:42.227]  It's coming up.
[00:36:43.308 --> 00:36:45.328]  Documentary filmmaker, TV maker, actor.
[00:36:46.749 --> 00:36:47.569]  There's the guitar right there.
[00:36:48.329 --> 00:36:50.550]  And, of course, the firstborn son of Chuck Norris.
[00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:52.470]  Doesn't get any better than that.
[00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:53.771]  And we are very flattered.
[00:36:53.791 --> 00:36:55.351]  Chuck Norris, of course, has been on the show a few times.
[00:36:55.391 --> 00:36:56.171]  I know he is a listener.
[00:36:57.011 --> 00:37:02.253]  And, of course, nice photo you sent us of you down there at the ranch with him with the Infowars.com shirt.
[00:37:02.573 --> 00:37:11.295]  Before we get into Amerigeddon premiere, this trailer, talk about all the censorship and things that it has basically gone through.
[00:37:12.751 --> 00:37:17.974]  What about the idea of drafting Chuck Norris 2016?
[00:37:18.074 --> 00:37:26.059]  I think he would be even way more invincible and measured in what he said than somebody like even Donald Trump.
[00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:28.980]  And I like Donald Trump, he's been on, he obviously is the big Republican leader.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.702]  Or what about a Chuck Norris, Donald Trump ticket?
[00:37:31.742 --> 00:37:33.323]  I mean, I know your dad is known for being
[00:37:33.943 --> 00:37:34.664]  I don't think so.
[00:37:48.379 --> 00:37:53.481]  From Texas or from Oklahoma, you know, who's been in the military the whole nine yards, versus these lawyers.
[00:37:53.561 --> 00:37:55.181]  And Ted Cruz is a lawyer, I like him.
[00:37:55.561 --> 00:37:57.842]  But I like Rand Paul because he's an optometrist or whatever.
[00:37:58.843 --> 00:38:00.183]  Trump, he's a self-made billionaire.
[00:38:00.623 --> 00:38:05.365]  I really am just sick of these inside-the-beltway people that are smoking their own dope.
[00:38:05.425 --> 00:38:09.166]  But Mike Norris, before we get into Amerigeddon, all things Chuck Norris.
[00:38:09.186 --> 00:38:16.889]  You always tell me some cool stuff behind-the-scenes baseball, and we're going to work to get your dad on soon, but he's really kind of been chilling out, writing for WorldNet daily, and he deserves that.
[00:38:17.729 --> 00:38:20.590]  But, wow, I mean, America needs Chuck Norris.
[00:38:21.611 --> 00:38:22.511]  How great would that be?
[00:38:23.131 --> 00:38:25.692]  To have my dad as the President of the United States.
[00:38:25.752 --> 00:38:33.936]  I mean, it's been great to kind of witness his evolution into the film industry, but, wow, President would be great.
[00:38:35.096 --> 00:38:35.416]  I'm in.
[00:38:35.476 --> 00:38:37.097]  I'd love to go to the White House to see him there.
[00:38:37.317 --> 00:38:39.958]  How long was he the top grossing action figure ever?
[00:38:39.978 --> 00:38:42.499]  I mean, wasn't like a decade he was the top grossing of all time?
[00:38:42.639 --> 00:38:47.900]  Yeah, every four months he'd have a new film come out, number one in the box office, and it was great.
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:55.022]  That was, you know, the 80s and 90s, and then he started on Walker, Texas Ranger, and that just kind of took it to a whole nother level.
[00:38:55.382 --> 00:38:57.923]  You know, they can say they're going to have Chimera clones now.
[00:38:58.003 --> 00:39:02.284]  We could dig up John Wayne, and then your dad could donate some stem cells.
[00:39:02.344 --> 00:39:05.425]  We could create a John Wayne Chuck Norris creature.
[00:39:07.105 --> 00:39:07.445]  I'm in.
[00:39:07.785 --> 00:39:09.486]  Let's throw a little Alex Jones in there, too.
[00:39:09.686 --> 00:39:11.067]  No, no, no.
[00:39:11.087 --> 00:39:13.908]  We'll throw Donald Trump's hair in, genetically.
[00:39:13.928 --> 00:39:15.369]  The creature will have Donald Trump's hair.
[00:39:16.329 --> 00:39:17.049]  I like his hair.
[00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:18.190]  What's wrong with it?
[00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.670]  I hear you.
[00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:21.592]  We'll mix in some Elvis.
[00:39:22.892 --> 00:39:24.753]  We'll dig up George Washington, mix in some of that.
[00:39:25.253 --> 00:39:26.154]  Little Ronald Reagan?
[00:39:26.454 --> 00:39:26.714]  Sure.
[00:39:27.494 --> 00:39:29.075]  We won't be mixing any Schwarzenegger in.
[00:39:29.895 --> 00:39:30.435]  Or Clinton.
[00:39:30.716 --> 00:39:32.516]  Or Clinton.
[00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:33.597]  Hillary, though, so beautiful.
[00:39:35.464 --> 00:39:37.770]  Sorry, just spit up a little bit.
[00:39:38.091 --> 00:39:39.695]  But no, I mean, could your dad be convinced?
[00:39:39.735 --> 00:39:40.979]  I mean, I know people brought it up to him.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.663]  What would his reservations be?
[00:39:42.723 --> 00:39:44.227]  I mean, give any to running for president.
[00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:49.350]  You know, I think the idea of it is really cool.
[00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:54.851]  But, you know, he's so much into his foundation, his Kickstart Foundation.
[00:39:54.951 --> 00:39:55.971]  Helping kids.
[00:39:56.011 --> 00:39:56.911]  Helping kids.
[00:39:57.711 --> 00:40:00.292]  He's starting a new water company, Seaforce Water.
[00:40:00.612 --> 00:40:02.272]  So he's busy right now.
[00:40:02.832 --> 00:40:05.192]  But he's very in tune with what's happening in the world.
[00:40:05.572 --> 00:40:08.353]  He's very in tune with the media.
[00:40:08.713 --> 00:40:12.794]  Knowing full well the media is, the mainstream media, is a lie.
[00:40:13.234 --> 00:40:14.054]  And I think that's,
[00:40:15.074 --> 00:40:18.916]  That's important because we need people like you and my father to let people know.
[00:40:20.076 --> 00:40:22.057]  Fox, CNN, ABC, NBC.
[00:40:22.858 --> 00:40:23.538]  It's all a lie.
[00:40:23.898 --> 00:40:26.519]  And if you really want to get news, where do we go?
[00:40:26.599 --> 00:40:27.360]  We go to Alex.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.140]  We go to Drudge.
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.181]  We go to Breitbart.
[00:40:29.461 --> 00:40:31.462]  That's where we got to go now to get our information.
[00:40:32.002 --> 00:40:42.107]  So... Is it surprising to you that it came out, FBI agents and others have said they were blocked from investigating this couple and that mosque, and actually had the Civil Rights Commission from the White House sent down to stop them?
[00:40:43.768 --> 00:40:44.348]  Ridiculous.
[00:40:44.508 --> 00:40:48.030]  And then now it came out confirmed that the White House ordered the FBI to say this wasn't terrorism.
[00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:52.172]  Yeah, I watched it kind of unfold.
[00:40:53.293 --> 00:40:59.156]  Interestingly enough, the day Donald was on your show, I'm fixated on watching Donald Trump on your show.
[00:40:59.176 --> 00:41:01.837]  And then two hours later, this thing happens.
[00:41:02.518 --> 00:41:04.979]  I'm watching it unfold and slowly but surely,
[00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:18.171]  I'd watch Fox, I'd watch CNN, but everything from Fox, they'd say his name was a Muslim name, and then two hours later, CNN would have to, ugh, they were Muslims.
[00:41:18.371 --> 00:41:19.552]  But it wasn't terror?
[00:41:19.812 --> 00:41:21.834]  No, no, gosh no, it wasn't terror.
[00:41:21.914 --> 00:41:22.375]  Not at all.
[00:41:22.855 --> 00:41:26.659]  I mean, vest, bombs, going to Pakistan, and it turns out the government knew?
[00:41:27.099 --> 00:41:28.240]  Order the FBI to stand down.
[00:41:29.301 --> 00:41:29.802]  Yeah, to me.
[00:41:30.122 --> 00:41:33.766]  How about them letting the media in the apartment?
[00:41:33.906 --> 00:41:36.168]  Two days later, cameras inside the apartment.
[00:41:36.188 --> 00:41:36.849]  That's a crime scene.
[00:41:36.889 --> 00:41:38.170]  The bed hadn't even been turned.
[00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.391]  No.
[00:41:38.711 --> 00:41:39.892]  The walls hadn't been torn out.
[00:41:40.172 --> 00:41:44.897]  Normally, in a real attack like this, if they didn't want to get rid of the crime scene, it'd be closed for months.
[00:41:44.977 --> 00:41:46.239]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:41:46.399 --> 00:41:46.859]  Absolutely.
[00:41:47.139 --> 00:41:49.122]  And that's why I need Gary here for this.
[00:41:49.502 --> 00:41:50.743]  Let's talk about the guy.
[00:41:51.704 --> 00:41:51.965]  Absolutely.
[00:41:51.985 --> 00:41:52.946]  Let's get into the film.
[00:41:53.327 --> 00:41:57.573]  Let's talk about America and we're going to be playing the trailer coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:41:57.793 --> 00:41:59.596]  The trailer is now at Infowars.com.
[00:42:00.497 --> 00:42:03.562]  And let's talk about people like Gary taking action to make this film.
[00:42:04.056 --> 00:42:09.240]  You know, Gary and Diane Haven, to me, are amazing people.
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:27.613]  Here's a guy that has created a successful company, a successful business, has all the money in the world to do whatever he wants, and what he has decided to do is he's going to stand up, he's going to put his money up, and he's going to create content, create films that is to expose the elites of the world.
[00:42:27.673 --> 00:42:28.694]  This is just the beginning.
[00:42:28.774 --> 00:42:29.755]  You're ready to announce this?
[00:42:30.375 --> 00:42:30.796]  This is it.
[00:42:31.576 --> 00:42:33.037]  All right, well go ahead and tell folks about it.
[00:42:33.437 --> 00:42:41.403]  We're launching the Facebook for the first time, the website, the trailer, amerageddonthemovie.com, links at infowars.com, Facebook, Twitter.
[00:42:41.684 --> 00:42:43.625]  Will this film save the world by itself?
[00:42:43.745 --> 00:42:43.925]  No.
[00:42:44.165 --> 00:42:45.386]  Will this show do it by itself?
[00:42:45.446 --> 00:42:45.606]  No.
[00:42:45.867 --> 00:42:47.067]  Will Mike Norris by himself?
[00:42:47.148 --> 00:42:47.268]  No.
[00:42:47.328 --> 00:42:48.969]  Or Chuck Norris at WorldNetDaily?
[00:42:49.029 --> 00:42:49.169]  No.
[00:42:49.489 --> 00:42:56.454]  But all of us together, standing up to the New World Order, standing up to what's happening, the truth will expose what they're doing.
[00:42:56.494 --> 00:42:59.477]  And so it's very important that you make this film a hit.
[00:43:00.345 --> 00:43:02.066]  It's very entertaining, but very informative.
[00:43:02.386 --> 00:43:04.448]  It's very important that when it comes out in theaters, you see it.
[00:43:04.688 --> 00:43:06.049]  When it's on demand, you watch it.
[00:43:06.869 --> 00:43:09.271]  That when it then hits DVD, Blu-ray, you get it.
[00:43:09.631 --> 00:43:15.875]  Because we're building on alternative media, and when you come, that's actually what helps us build it bigger.
[00:43:15.895 --> 00:43:16.736]  It's kind of like fill the dreams.
[00:43:17.016 --> 00:43:17.857]  Build it, they will come.
[00:43:18.137 --> 00:43:19.458]  Build something, they will come.
[00:43:19.718 --> 00:43:22.581]  But then you start supporting, it gets bigger and bigger.
[00:43:22.801 --> 00:43:24.563]  And that's what the system is afraid of.
[00:43:24.783 --> 00:43:29.387]  We got those documents from the Clinton Foundation 20 years ago saying, we gotta shut down this internet.
[00:43:29.688 --> 00:43:33.031]  What happens if Christians and libertarians and conservatives use it?
[00:43:33.331 --> 00:43:34.492]  That'll be it for us.
[00:43:34.813 --> 00:43:39.998]  So the talking point was, call them conspiracy theorists, call them racist, sick the IRS on them.
[00:43:40.318 --> 00:43:42.180]  And 20 years later, what do we see them doing?
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:43.401]  Exactly that.
[00:43:43.841 --> 00:43:44.422]  Exactly that.
[00:43:44.622 --> 00:43:47.244]  Getting back to the film, your dad warned you too, didn't he?
[00:43:47.704 --> 00:43:48.364]  Yeah, he did.
[00:43:48.605 --> 00:43:51.406]  And he warned me again after he saw the film.
[00:43:51.927 --> 00:43:55.089]  He goes, uh, just so you know, you are now on the list.
[00:43:56.842 --> 00:43:57.323]  What list?
[00:43:58.764 --> 00:43:59.404]  The hit list.
[00:44:00.365 --> 00:44:01.165]  And you know what?
[00:44:01.346 --> 00:44:03.047]  I wear that badge with honor.
[00:44:03.827 --> 00:44:06.809]  Because if I'm doing something... And he was saying that in a good way to you.
[00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:07.810]  In a good way.
[00:44:08.551 --> 00:44:11.753]  Hey, I don't want to die for this movie.
[00:44:12.434 --> 00:44:13.374]  And I'm not putting words in your mouth.
[00:44:13.394 --> 00:44:14.815]  He told me at the time he said he was proud of you.
[00:44:15.476 --> 00:44:16.036]  Absolutely.
[00:44:16.256 --> 00:44:16.717]  Absolutely.
[00:44:16.757 --> 00:44:18.038]  He loved the movie.
[00:44:18.118 --> 00:44:19.579]  We have his full support on the film.
[00:44:22.318 --> 00:44:23.719]  That's a huge blessing to us.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.741]  But today is a big day.
[00:44:26.861 --> 00:44:29.583]  I mean, this is a movie we've been working on for a year and a half.
[00:44:30.564 --> 00:44:37.729]  It's a concept of Gary Havens, who I wish he could be here right now, but he is taking care of business somewhere in the world.
[00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:38.709]  I don't know.
[00:44:38.869 --> 00:44:40.611]  I'll find out next week when I see him.
[00:44:41.791 --> 00:44:43.012]  But this was his brainchild.
[00:44:43.032 --> 00:44:44.573]  He's like a James Bond character himself.
[00:44:44.653 --> 00:44:45.574]  He really is.
[00:44:45.814 --> 00:44:47.616]  He is so fascinating.
[00:44:48.536 --> 00:44:53.300]  So knowledgeable, and you know it's kind of like talking to you, you just kind of get sucked in.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.161]  Oh you're too nice.
[00:44:55.202 --> 00:44:56.202]  He's more interesting than I am.
[00:44:57.143 --> 00:44:59.405]  And he's so knowledgeable, and he's so passionate.
[00:44:59.645 --> 00:45:02.667]  And like I said, here's a guy that could have done whatever he wants.
[00:45:03.468 --> 00:45:07.251]  He could go to his island, he could go to Australia, he's got property everywhere.
[00:45:07.471 --> 00:45:08.332]  Very well set up.
[00:45:08.973 --> 00:45:10.274]  But this is what he decided
[00:45:11.397 --> 00:45:12.418]  This is important to him.
[00:45:12.679 --> 00:45:22.933]  He wants to expose the corruption, the demonic elite that is really... I know, having dinner with him and breakfast and stuff with his wife, they are really focused, they're really serious.
[00:45:23.633 --> 00:45:24.995]  Very serious, very serious.
[00:45:25.576 --> 00:45:27.559]  And he's helped inform Governor Abbott and stuff?
[00:45:28.059 --> 00:45:28.640]  Absolutely.
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:32.484]  He has sat down with... All of them, basically.
[00:45:32.544 --> 00:45:33.565]  Pretty much all of them.
[00:45:33.925 --> 00:45:38.890]  And, you know, those are his... Inside baseball.
[00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:44.575]  That I wasn't part of, so I don't know exactly what was... He was just telling me that a lot of people are awake now.
[00:45:44.595 --> 00:45:46.177]  Which I pick up on as well, talking to folks.
[00:45:54.807 --> 00:45:56.228]  My whole life has been so good.
[00:45:56.248 --> 00:45:59.492]  There's been a lot of trials and tribulations, but all of it's made me stronger.
[00:46:00.232 --> 00:46:02.194]  And I just want to experience this journey with you.
[00:46:02.214 --> 00:46:10.022]  I want our children to grow up together, and their children and their children to have a future that goes to the stars and beyond.
[00:46:10.062 --> 00:46:10.923]  And we can do this.
[00:46:11.563 --> 00:46:12.604]  I just want to win.
[00:46:12.624 --> 00:46:14.907]  I want humanity to succeed.
[00:46:15.948 --> 00:46:18.650]  And I'm so sick of people that don't like humanity.
[00:46:22.691 --> 00:46:25.914]  So I get wound up because it's fight and flight, and there's nowhere to run.
[00:46:26.374 --> 00:46:27.915]  So I'm like a raccoon in the garage.
[00:46:27.935 --> 00:46:28.916]  Somebody's about to kill me.
[00:46:28.936 --> 00:46:29.436]  I don't have a choice.
[00:46:29.456 --> 00:46:29.957]  I'm gonna fight.
[00:46:29.977 --> 00:46:30.938]  I'm gonna fight.
[00:46:33.039 --> 00:46:33.820]  I'm gonna fight.
[00:46:50.731 --> 00:46:53.912]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:46:54.172 --> 00:46:54.312]  Right?
[00:46:54.332 --> 00:46:56.673]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:46:57.033 --> 00:47:00.574]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:00.614 --> 00:47:03.755]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:04.255 --> 00:47:09.057]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:09.597 --> 00:47:11.457]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:47:11.817 --> 00:47:16.259]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:16.419 --> 00:47:18.439]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.520]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:20.820]  Exactly.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:24.742]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:25.262 --> 00:47:33.306]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:47:38.197 --> 00:47:43.202]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:47:43.443 --> 00:47:49.549]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:47:49.749 --> 00:47:56.717]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:47:57.057 --> 00:48:07.003]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:07.563 --> 00:48:13.486]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:13.726 --> 00:48:16.888]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and
[00:48:17.188 --> 00:48:18.289]  Adenosylcobalamin.
[00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:21.891]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:48:22.151 --> 00:48:23.772]  No needles, no injections.
[00:48:24.033 --> 00:48:25.513]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:48:25.694 --> 00:48:26.714]  Try it for yourself.
[00:48:26.894 --> 00:48:27.895]  Discover the secret.
[00:48:28.115 --> 00:48:28.455]  Secret 12.

[00:48:41.618 --> 00:48:44.541]  Now joining us until about 50 after is Tucker Carlson.
[00:48:44.922 --> 00:48:50.268]  He's a 20 year plus media veteran with a wide variety of experience in journalism, currently at Fox News.
[00:48:50.668 --> 00:48:54.873]  Carlson has also been CNN, MSNBC, PBS, you name it, GQ Magazine.
[00:48:55.313 --> 00:48:58.617]  But really what he's best known for, in my view, is the hard-hitting news
[00:49:00.158 --> 00:49:13.668]  Exposing both sides of the police state, everything from Black Lives Matter to the Private Fellow Reserve, you name it, DailyCaller.com, which is a mainstay when you see links to Infowars.com or places like DrugsReport.com.
[00:49:13.688 --> 00:49:14.548]  There's so much to cover.
[00:49:14.609 --> 00:49:19.412]  Trump, where the dinosaur media is, are they really on their last legs?
[00:49:19.432 --> 00:49:20.393]  I mean, I know you're on Fox.
[00:49:20.433 --> 00:49:27.378]  I wouldn't call it dinosaur media because it's at least somewhat conservative, and so it has a big audience, but the others don't have audiences.
[00:49:28.178 --> 00:49:29.159]  They're facades.
[00:49:29.219 --> 00:49:34.363]  I mean, I can turn on a Facebook Mentions at home and get a million and a half viewers anytime I want.
[00:49:34.723 --> 00:49:36.625]  Their biggest show doesn't have a half million.
[00:49:37.425 --> 00:49:42.649]  So when does the zombie finally fall down and die, or can it not die because it's already dead?
[00:49:42.709 --> 00:49:43.430]  Tucker Carlson.
[00:49:44.911 --> 00:49:46.612]  I've never heard it put that way, but I love it.
[00:49:47.053 --> 00:49:53.037]  I mean, you're watching it die now, and you're watching Donald Trump benefit from its death.
[00:49:53.217 --> 00:49:57.801]  I mean, in my view, the worst thing about Trump is the media reaction to him.
[00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:07.281]  Which is so hyperventilating and self-righteous, it's merely an excuse for reporters to explain that they're morally superior to Donald Trump.
[00:50:07.887 --> 00:50:09.187]  You know, he's a bad person.
[00:50:09.227 --> 00:50:10.128]  They're great people.
[00:50:10.268 --> 00:50:14.288]  It's a vehicle for their vanity and self-aggrandizement.
[00:50:14.548 --> 00:50:15.349]  It's disgusting.
[00:50:15.749 --> 00:50:24.351]  And, you know, there are things about Trump that I don't agree with, and there are certainly things about his rhetoric that I think ought to be more precise, that he'll explain better.
[00:50:25.431 --> 00:50:33.273]  But none of that really compares in emotional impact to the feeling I get watching the press whine about him and declare him dangerous.
[00:50:33.353 --> 00:50:34.933]  Every time I hear that, I feel like sending him money.
[00:50:36.696 --> 00:50:37.337]  I agree with you.
[00:50:37.397 --> 00:50:41.480]  What about Senator Leslie Graham?
[00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:44.483]  I mean, excuse me, Lindsey Graham, the beauty queen.
[00:50:44.803 --> 00:50:48.647]  He is up there just saying it's race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot.
[00:50:48.887 --> 00:50:50.869]  Let's watch that clip from the Communist News Network.
[00:50:52.403 --> 00:50:54.605]  Well, I want to talk to the Trump supporters for a minute.
[00:50:54.986 --> 00:50:57.748]  I don't know who you are and I don't know why you like this guy.
[00:50:58.289 --> 00:51:02.493]  I think what you like about him, he appears to be strong when the rest of us are weak.
[00:51:03.074 --> 00:51:06.217]  He's a very successful businessman and he's going to make everything great.
[00:51:06.237 --> 00:51:10.662]  He's going to take all the problems of the world and put them in a box and make your life better.
[00:51:11.222 --> 00:51:12.143]  That's what he's selling.
[00:51:12.544 --> 00:51:13.384]  Here's what you're buying.
[00:51:14.205 --> 00:51:17.526]  He's a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot.
[00:51:17.666 --> 00:51:19.167]  He doesn't represent my party.
[00:51:19.527 --> 00:51:23.969]  He doesn't represent the values that the men and women who wear the uniform are fighting for.
[00:51:24.229 --> 00:51:25.950]  I've been in the Air Force for 33 years.
[00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:27.090]  I retired this June.
[00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:29.511]  He's the ISIL man of the year, by the way.
[00:51:29.531 --> 00:51:32.172]  He just got back from Morocco a week ago this Monday.
[00:51:32.192 --> 00:51:35.734]  Hillary, we played the clip last hour, also says he's playing right in the hands of ISIS.
[00:51:36.014 --> 00:51:39.095]  Last time I checked, he didn't run the State Department that helped build up ISIS.
[00:51:39.415 --> 00:51:41.656]  We have the former head of Defense Intelligence himself saying that.
[00:51:42.691 --> 00:51:44.772]  Tucker, let yourself talk.
[00:51:44.852 --> 00:51:45.452]  Jump in here.
[00:51:45.692 --> 00:51:46.892]  Where do you see all this going?
[00:51:47.453 --> 00:51:52.894]  Well, I mean, Lindsey Graham is the one who doesn't represent, obviously, the views of the Republican Party.
[00:51:53.094 --> 00:51:53.955]  Look at the numbers.
[00:51:54.035 --> 00:52:03.198]  I mean, you know, I don't dislike Lindsey Graham as a person, but he has no constituency, and he has, it strikes me, no deep knowledge of the region.
[00:52:03.258 --> 00:52:07.579]  He's the one who's forever telling us we need to arm this or that group about which he knows nothing.
[00:52:07.739 --> 00:52:07.879]  I don't
[00:52:27.436 --> 00:52:31.717]  I would be shocked if Donald Trump awoke in the middle of the night seething with hatred toward Muslims.
[00:52:31.797 --> 00:52:33.058]  I don't know but I doubt it.
[00:52:33.238 --> 00:52:33.578]  He doesn't.
[00:52:33.598 --> 00:52:48.262]  I think Donald Trump is just really worried that we're gonna see more terror attacks in the country and you look at Europe and its inability over 70 years to integrate and assimilate large Muslim populations and it does make you wonder like what do you you know we don't want to be Sweden or Belgium or
[00:52:48.402 --> 00:52:48.642]  Okay.
[00:53:05.365 --> 00:53:12.594]  Well, it's an extreme statement, but it's extreme to have 80% being military age men, 80 plus percent fake passports.
[00:53:12.674 --> 00:53:17.299]  Mainly these are Sunni invaders into Syria, that's all admitted, who got their butt kicked.
[00:53:17.459 --> 00:53:19.382]  They're now going into Turkey, going into Europe.
[00:53:19.702 --> 00:53:24.328]  And just a month or so ago, Trump said, hey, we've got to let these poor refugees in.
[00:53:24.588 --> 00:53:25.429]  We've got to take them.
[00:53:25.669 --> 00:53:28.194]  His own constituents said, hey, a lot of them are terrorists.
[00:53:28.454 --> 00:53:31.440]  He got informed and then he changed his mind.
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:35.246]  He knows there's going to be more terror attacks after Paris and now San Bernardino.
[00:53:35.266 --> 00:53:35.867]  That's right.
[00:53:36.048 --> 00:53:37.310]  And they're taking him out of context.
[00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:38.673]  He doesn't dislike anybody.
[00:53:39.301 --> 00:53:40.261]  Well, exactly.
[00:53:40.401 --> 00:53:49.963]  And again, you have to compare the recklessness of Trump, and sometimes he is reckless, with the recklessness of the people who now run everything, and Lindsey Graham is a perfect representative of that group.
[00:53:50.063 --> 00:54:01.866]  Right after the Paris terror attacks, Lindsey Graham was not only calling for more Syrian immigration into the United States, but saying anyone who opposed it was somehow a nativist or a bigot or a bad person or immoral or on the wrong side of God.
[00:54:02.406 --> 00:54:02.706]  Really?
[00:54:02.726 --> 00:54:05.526]  I mean, there's no room for debate on this?
[00:54:05.626 --> 00:54:08.387]  I mean, ask yourself the question, does any adult really
[00:54:10.951 --> 00:54:14.553]  By a million refugees from Syria and surrounding countries.
[00:54:14.613 --> 00:54:16.134]  Pakistanis are not just Syrians.
[00:54:16.534 --> 00:54:25.139]  I don't think anybody really believes that, and yet Time Magazine just gave Angela Merkel the Person of the Year award, and it is in fact an award, to congratulate her for doing that.
[00:54:25.239 --> 00:54:26.880]  What's the effect of that kind of immigration?
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.363]  It makes the people in power feel virtuous, they can feel like good people, but they don't have to deal with any of the consequences.
[00:54:32.663 --> 00:54:34.184]  They don't send their children to public school.
[00:54:34.584 --> 00:54:37.005]  They're not competing for jobs with these people.
[00:54:37.025 --> 00:54:39.586]  They're surrounded by armed bodyguards that taxpayers pay for.
[00:54:39.826 --> 00:54:43.967]  There's really no downside for them, but there's a massive downside for everybody else.
[00:54:44.027 --> 00:54:45.027]  They are out of touch.
[00:54:45.328 --> 00:54:49.089]  They really don't care about the effect of their policies on the people they're supposed to be representing.
[00:54:49.509 --> 00:54:51.511]  And we really ought to be outraged about that.
[00:54:51.591 --> 00:54:53.373]  And I'm hardly like some wild-eyed populist.
[00:54:53.393 --> 00:54:54.974]  I think I'm pretty reasonable and mainstream.
[00:54:55.315 --> 00:54:56.776]  But it's worth being mad about that.
[00:54:56.896 --> 00:54:59.919]  Madder indeed than you are, than people are at Donald Trump.
[00:55:00.039 --> 00:55:01.681]  Like, who's really at fault here?
[00:55:02.241 --> 00:55:03.903]  Well, let's take Huma Abedin.
[00:55:03.983 --> 00:55:07.406]  I notice you have a picture behind you of her on your wall, that Ringling Brothers.
[00:55:07.867 --> 00:55:08.808]  It actually does look like her.
[00:55:09.268 --> 00:55:10.529]  Hillary Clinton's special friend.
[00:55:10.969 --> 00:55:12.670]  I don't care if Hillary has special friends.
[00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:13.830]  I'm a libertarian like you are.
[00:55:14.251 --> 00:55:18.413]  But if this was Trump or a conservative, we know there'd be a spotlight on it.
[00:55:18.873 --> 00:55:21.814]  And then her whole background, she seems to just get away with everything.
[00:55:22.355 --> 00:55:28.258]  I think that also sticks in people's craw that these Democrats and establishment Republicans are above the law.
[00:55:28.518 --> 00:55:29.478]  They don't get reviewed.
[00:55:29.518 --> 00:55:30.479]  They don't get looked at.
[00:55:30.939 --> 00:55:36.661]  And then Hillary's little hippo, uh, she can do whatever she wants and, you know, stay in the same hotel room or whatever.
[00:55:36.701 --> 00:55:37.741]  I mean, this should be looked into.
[00:55:37.781 --> 00:55:44.643]  And then Drudge and you and others are criticized for investigating Hillary's health, investigating her taste in women.
[00:55:44.924 --> 00:55:46.724]  I mean, isn't all of this open game?
[00:55:46.744 --> 00:55:50.545]  Kuma Abedin, let's just assess the public record, okay?
[00:55:50.685 --> 00:55:51.586]  That's enough.
[00:55:51.646 --> 00:55:54.007]  I'm willing to give everyone a pass on their private lives or whatever.
[00:55:54.027 --> 00:55:55.207]  Why do you have a picture of her on your wall?
[00:55:56.298 --> 00:55:56.839]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:58.541]  It's from the 40s.
[00:55:58.721 --> 00:55:59.682]  It predates even Huma.
[00:56:00.383 --> 00:56:11.156]  She sent out an email two days ago in which she called Donald Trump, quote, a racist for opposing Islamic immigration, as if Islam is a race rather than a religion.
[00:56:11.216 --> 00:56:12.999]  It's not a racial or ethnic category.
[00:56:13.039 --> 00:56:13.639]  That's insane.
[00:56:13.679 --> 00:56:15.522]  Now that is exactly the kind.
[00:56:16.122 --> 00:56:21.647]  Of language, of rhetoric that divides people, that makes people hate each other, that whips the population into a greater frenzy.
[00:56:21.967 --> 00:56:25.970]  Again, that's every bit as irresponsible as anything Donald Trump has suggested.
[00:56:26.090 --> 00:56:29.993]  And unlike Donald Trump, she's actually in a position of power.
[00:56:30.034 --> 00:56:34.117]  I mean, Huma Abedin was a federal official, a State Department official.
[00:56:34.577 --> 00:56:43.054]  Up until pretty recently, a Obama administration official, and yet she can send an email like that out and nobody cares.
[00:56:43.234 --> 00:56:44.577]  It's fine, it's just a reaction.
[00:56:44.677 --> 00:56:46.200]  He's dangerous, no wonder she's upset.
[00:56:47.617 --> 00:56:49.138]  It is all of this.
[00:56:49.278 --> 00:56:52.160]  The Trump phenomenon is a reaction against that.
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:53.581]  And I tell people who are upset.
[00:56:53.601 --> 00:56:56.363]  A lot of Republicans in Washington, as you know, are horrified by Trump.
[00:56:56.383 --> 00:56:57.523]  They hate him more than they hate Obama.
[00:56:57.803 --> 00:56:59.004]  He's a direct threat to their power.
[00:56:59.384 --> 00:57:01.926]  And I always say to them, there's a reason he's here.
[00:57:02.026 --> 00:57:04.828]  And that's because you have been a bad steward of this party.
[00:57:05.228 --> 00:57:07.409]  The president has been a bad steward of the federal government.
[00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:09.991]  A lot of the business community have been bad stewards of the economy.
[00:57:10.752 --> 00:57:19.799]  The people running things haven't done a very good job, so it shouldn't surprise you that someone like Donald Trump arrives on the scene and gets really popular by telling the truth about your failures.
[00:57:19.899 --> 00:57:20.899]  Like, why is that shocking?
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:25.463]  Tucker Carlson's our guest, Fox News, FoxNews.com, DailyCaller.com.
[00:57:26.023 --> 00:57:30.867]  That's got to be the quote of the last week or so, the most crystallized, boiled-down truth that last 20 seconds.
[00:57:31.287 --> 00:57:31.648]  That's it!
[00:57:32.168 --> 00:57:34.870]  They don't dislike him because he's a bigot or he's hateful.
[00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:36.751]  They hate him because he'll win.
[00:57:37.112 --> 00:57:38.713]  He's not part of their power structure.
[00:57:38.993 --> 00:57:51.763]  They've been caught working with the Democrats and he represents the Tea Party, the Libertarians, taking over the Grand Old Party and kicking, you know, these weasels out of Toad Hall who have invaded and taken over.
[00:57:52.383 --> 00:57:54.725]  And he is a bellwether of that and they're panicking.
[00:57:55.285 --> 00:58:00.068]  What's so funny is they're in a lather this morning about the idea that he might run third party.
[00:58:00.408 --> 00:58:01.108]  Here's the news flash.
[00:58:01.208 --> 00:58:02.649]  He already is running third party.
[00:58:03.049 --> 00:58:06.271]  He's already broken with Republican orthodoxy on economics.
[00:58:06.291 --> 00:58:07.631]  He's attacked the hedge fund people.
[00:58:07.671 --> 00:58:09.172]  He's broken with them on foreign policy.
[00:58:09.472 --> 00:58:11.313]  He's pointed out the Iraq war was a disaster.
[00:58:11.353 --> 00:58:12.754]  That's not allowed, but he did it anyway.
[00:58:13.074 --> 00:58:15.415]  He's being attacked by the head of the RNC.
[00:58:15.756 --> 00:58:16.896]  He's hated by donors.
[00:58:16.996 --> 00:58:18.077]  He's hated by lobbyists.
[00:58:18.097 --> 00:58:21.278]  He's hated by the entire Washington establishment and the other candidates.
[00:58:21.659 --> 00:58:23.099]  Or some of them said he won't vote for him.
[00:58:23.259 --> 00:58:24.200]  He's actually not
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:25.982]  He's not running as a Republican.
[00:58:26.022 --> 00:58:26.682]  Here's a newsflash.
[00:58:26.722 --> 00:58:28.024]  And maybe that's why he's succeeding.
[00:58:28.544 --> 00:58:32.749]  And again, I've always kind of voted Republican because I don't see the choice.
[00:58:33.089 --> 00:58:41.498]  But the truth is the Republican coalition for 40 years has been a combination of libertarian economic policy and neoconservative foreign policy.
[00:58:41.818 --> 00:58:44.861]  And neither one has worked for a lot of people in the middle of the country.
[00:58:44.901 --> 00:58:45.622]  That's just the truth.
[00:58:48.809 --> 00:58:49.990]  Knockout is back.
[00:58:50.310 --> 00:59:01.414]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:01.815 --> 00:59:03.515]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:04.076 --> 00:59:13.139]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:13.539 --> 00:59:15.320]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.741]  It's the same price
[00:59:17.461 --> 00:59:23.364]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[00:59:23.904 --> 00:59:30.148]  It's got the GABA, so it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[00:59:30.648 --> 00:59:30.768]  It's $19.95.
[00:59:31.488 --> 00:59:33.830]  You take one or two of these,
[00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:38.212]  And it just is really clean restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[00:59:38.553 --> 00:59:42.435]  It's what I've experienced and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
